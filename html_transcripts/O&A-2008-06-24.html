<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast on Tuesday, June 24th, 2008, was a whirlwind of topics, delivered with their characteristically unrestrained and often offensive style.  The show began with Opie and Anthony (with Patrice O'Neal filling in for Jim Norton) recounting their recent trip to Atlantis in the Bahamas. Anthony detailed his significant gambling losses at blackjack, and an awkward post-comedy show encounter with Patrice and his girlfriend. Opie praised Patrice’s seated stand-up performance.  The jovial tone shifted abruptly with the announcement of George Carlin's death, prompting a discussion of his comedic legacy and comparisons to Richard Pryor. This segued into a lengthy, highly offensive segment dissecting Don Imus's controversial remarks about Adam "Pacman" Jones, focusing on its racist implications and Imus's subsequent apology, punctuated by the hosts' frequent use of racial slurs and vulgar language. A "F.U. Line" segment featured similarly offensive caller voicemails.  They also criticized XM staff for using a clip of a previous incident with "Homeless Charlie," which resulted in a 30-day suspension for the hosts.

The broadcast continued with the infamous "Tippy Tom" segment, focusing on the overwhelmingly foul odor emanating from a studio guest, resulting in widespread disgust and an angry phone call from Anthony demanding disinfection.  Photos and audio clips of this event were mentioned as being online.  A highly intoxicated caller, Tara, then engaged in a sexually explicit and vulgar conversation with the hosts about her drug use, promiscuity, and self-destructive behaviors.

A significant portion of the show involved a heated debate about Anthony's racial preferences in women.  Anthony explicitly stated his preference for white women, outlining a perceived racial hierarchy of attractiveness, sparking considerable pushback from Opie and Patrice. The discussion devolved into explicit racial stereotypes and vulgar language, with various audience members and callers offering contrasting perspectives. Specific women, including Megan Good and Christina Milian, were mentioned and their physical attributes discussed with overtly racist undertones. Malik, a caller, offered a counterpoint.

The Don Imus apology continued to be a recurring topic, with the hosts mocking Imus's increasingly frantic attempts at damage control.  Speculation about a purported Vince McMahon injury, where stage equipment allegedly fell on him during a WWE event, was another major segment. The hosts, along with a guest caller, Sam Roberts, debated the incident's authenticity, suggesting staging, and discussed McMahon's potential motivations and the possible involvement of other WWE personnel.  Audio clips of the incident and a call with a supposed WWE contest winner were played.

"Circle Mouth from Philly," a caller, criticized Opie for having a guest throw money at an employee. Opie denied the accusation.  The Vince McMahon injury dominated a further segment, with wild speculation about the severity (paralysis being a recurring joke), sabotage, and the impact on WWE storylines and stock prices.  Audio of McMahon’s post-accident reaction, including his mention of not feeling his legs and referring to Triple H (Paul Levesque), was played, with repeated attempts to contact Triple H.  Al Sharpton's recent comments were also discussed, along with the EMT response and sarcastic commentary on WWE’s response.  The show also mocked a Larry King interview with Mötley Crüe. Listeners called in sharing experiences with limb loss, often involving machinery or animals (especially alligators), resulting in crude humor and the use of racial stereotypes.  Patrice O'Neal fell asleep on air, leading to further comedic commentary and a callback segment when he awoke.

The show concluded with an interview with George Takei and his partner, Brad Altman, who recounted their proposal story using explicit language, followed by further discussion of Don Imus and the controversy, incorporating contrasting opinions from bloggers and callers.  The hosts and Patrice O'Neal engaged in a crude exchange about O'Neal's video blogs, his girlfriend, and numerous offensive jokes revolving around race, sex, and physical appearance, including commentary on Anthony's physique.  The final goodbyes were peppered with offensive remarks.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Talk show radio host, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  All right, we get it.  Where are you driving to kick somebody out of the house?  No, Richard, I'm driving to a television program where I work here in Hollywood.  Opie and Anthony.  John, where do you work?  I work on Long Island, I can't really tell you that.  Oh, what radio station? 
[00:01:00]  Sorry, no.  Exactly!  Opie and Anthony.  I like boobies because I wasn't breastfed as a child.  Aww.  It's like Opie keeps E-Rock around.  Very good suckling.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Tuesday, June 24th, 2008. 
[00:01:30]  We are live.  Yes, people were confused.  Why?  They thought we were taking a whole week off.  Why would we do that?  Well, they thought because they heard you were going down to the Caribbean.  Usually people go down to the Caribbean for a week.  Yeah, it was good.  It was Friday until yesterday.  There you go.  So we are live.  In action.  Yes.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  A few things. 
[00:02:00]  Jim Norton's in LA doing the gong show with Dave Attell.  I think he's like one of the judges or something for the next couple of days.  I would hope he'd be a judge.  His career goes down to him being a contestant.  Yeah, maybe I should have said it that way.  I think.  No, of course, he's going to be judging some of the acts.  Yeah.  Our mics are very bassy.  I don't know what that's about.  Maybe we can tweak that a little bit.  I almost like it.  Sitting in for Jim Norton is Patrice O'Neal.  Good friend of the show.  Of course. 
[00:02:30]  A good friend of just the show.  Not a good friend in real life.  When these mics go off, we go our own ways.  Just like roaches.  I talk to Patrice on the street, though.  And...  Cut.  Yeah.  We never really go that...  We never really talk about anything that in depth on the street.  It's usually we're walking to the same parking garage.  Yeah.  Because your left leg is just shaking to get out of there.  Is it?  Hey, Anthony, so how are things?  I don't know.  Your left leg is moving. 
[00:03:00]  I'm, uh...  My car's up here.  Yeah, stop moonwalking as she's looking at you.  Anthony doesn't like spending any extra time in New York City.  That's his whole thing.  That's his whole thing.  That is true.  Show's over.  Get out.  He gets antsy if we're meeting about the show.  And then walking to his car if there's a little small talk on the curb.  No.  I gotta get out.  I'm a get out of New York kind of guy.  He does a star skiing hutch roll right into this big SUV.  I saw, uh, speaking of, uh, only friends on the, uh, radio and not in real life, I went 
[00:03:30]  and saw Patricia comics very recently.  And, uh...  The whole clan, too.  Uh-huh.  The whole clan was there.  Yeah, look.  That's called the Philly Crew.  And, uh, first of all, I haven't seen you in a while.  Holy S.  Are you just riffing up there?  Sometimes.  It's not...  No, I bow to you.  There's a direction I'm going, but...  I really bow to you because there's not a lot of comedians that are brave enough to  just go up there and riff.  They got some general ideas.  They're going to go some places.  But, uh, to me, I'm like, he is just making this up as he goes and he's killing. 
[00:04:00]  And they gave you a standing ovation at the end of the show and I need to tell everyone  that today.  I'll be honest.  It was...  The crowd was...  I'm not even...  You know, I'm not an ass kisser.  I usually hate the crowd.  Yeah, sure.  But, um, the crowd was ridiculously happy.  I don't know what was wrong with him.  It was almost like I felt bad if I didn't do well.  Yeah.  And you see some faces you don't like.  Yeah.  Um, my new hatred is white foreigners.  So anytime I see white foreigners, I go, good.  I get to just make, maybe make them leave. 
[00:04:30]  Well, like French people or...  Just any white, any white people that aren't from here.  Right.  Okay.  And they just sicken me.  They got that look.  And here's what bothers me about them.  They, they look at you.  They don't understand what you're saying, but instead of being humble enough to go,  I don't understand this language.  They look at you like you're not funny.  Wait a minute.  Instead of...  They don't understand.  I don't know what he's really saying, but they have a look of, this is awful.  And I, I gave him a French accent, but it's all of them.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  And just their money's worth something here now.  And they just arrogant and they just show up at different shows just to have an experience.  But, um, that crowd was ridiculous.  That particular night he's talking about.  Yeah.  The crowd was, I don't know what was wrong with them.  A Friday night.  They just were happy to be in.  They were loving you.  It was beautiful.  The other thing is you sit the whole time now.  I, I...  Patrice sits on a stool.  The hell you Cosby now?  What did you do?  Hold on a minute.  I'll tell you about it.  I'll tell you why.  He sits on a stool and I'm sitting there in the audience and I'm amazed by that, that 
[00:05:30]  he could hold court at this place comics, which is a nice comedy club.  And he sits on a stool for over an hour and, and just has the, the crowd in his hand.  That's amazing to me.  I started doing that from depression, but I couldn't, I couldn't afford not to do comedy.  So when I was depressed, I just sat down and started talking.  It's like, screw it.  I'm just going to sit here and talk and if they like it.  But he didn't get up once.  He got up, he got up to leave the stage and I found that amazing. 
[00:06:00]  I really did.  That makes it harder.  I'm thinking, cause you can't really work the room and do the pacing and you know what  I mean?  And get a little energy going.  Yeah.  And that just shows people how strong your material is.  It was good, man.  I was, I was, I was, it was, I had a good time.  I was happy to see them.  Yeah.  And then you and, uh, you know, sweetie puss could have came by one of these days.  It's in the, uh, the Bahamas.  No, not when I was there.  No, this was a couple of weeks ago.  And then, uh, uh, the other observation.  Now I know how you feel when you're doing stuff for an Opie and Anthony crowd. 
[00:06:30]  Cause I'm sitting in a Patrice O'Neill crowd.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  There was only a few O and A people.  How many O and A people there?  You, you know, there was only a few.  And then, uh, and then this is where I was leading to, uh, friends just on the show.  Cause then kind of hanging on the sidewalk and you and your lovely lady, thanks for coming  by.  I just kind of just walk off.  We should eat together or something.  I'm thinking, but no, neither one, neither one of us knew what to, neither one of us knew 
[00:07:00]  what to do.  Let me tell you how.  It was like awkward.  Let me tell you how I'm worse right now.  Eating didn't even cross my mind.  Yeah.  Really?  Like I didn't think maybe we should.  I, I did the, the goodbyes, the 40 hugs.  Everybody got 40 hugs.  Right.  And Opie got 41, 41.  I made sure he was the last hug.  Um, uh, uh, Lindsey had a, had a, Hey thing with my girl for about a good five minutes.  Lindsey's like, how can you take that?  You know? 
[00:07:30]  And then it's like, bye.  Bye.  And they just said goodbye.  And then they sauntered off.  We sauntered off and we both wanted the same thing.  Food.  I'm thinking I gotta walk around with a microphone in front of me and then we'd all feel more  comfortable.  That's a damn shame.  It's a damn shame, man.  Because human beings outside this with these microphones, it's very uncomfortable for  everybody.  It's just a professional relationship.  Yeah.  I don't, I don't really believe that to be honest with you.  I think, you know, you had a long night and you didn't want to be with your girl. 
[00:08:00]  That's fine.  Next time we're going to eat though.  We've been saying this forever.  We're going to eat again.  We ate one time.  We had a great time.  We was in the meat packing district.  So there was plenty of meat somewhere.  Lots to eat.  They're all about meat in the meat packing district.  I was, that was a good night, man.  I was happy.  That was actually actually a good memory.  I'm glad you, I'm glad you said that.  Well, I haven't seen you since.  And I got it.  Like I said, I haven't seen your comedy in a while.  And wow, man.  Wow.  Thank you, sir.  You had the room, the standing ovation.  I'm going to have to check out the Patrice O'Neal. 
[00:08:30]  It was quite impressive.  Yeah.  And I love comedians like you, like you that will make it up as you go along.  For the most part.  Like you're brave enough to go, you know what?  I'm feeling good.  And I got something here.  I'm going to just go with it.  You went off on some tangents that had them in the, laughing in the aisles.  Well, thank you, sir.  That was nice of you.  Appreciate that.  How was Atlanta, Sam?  Wonderful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Great weather.  The whole time.  It's just so nice down there.  You just don't want to come back.  Really. 
[00:09:00]  Isn't Atlanta kind of scumbaggy, though?  No, no.  Like it's not exclusive anymore?  No, there's this place there called The Cove now.  The Cove at Atlantis.  And that's where the special people go.  And that's the place.  Because that's where, you know, they kick the kids out.  There's a special area you go to with its own pool.  There's blackjack tables like right at the bar next to the pool.  So you don't even got to go to the casino to lose your money.  Oh, damn.  And...  Wait, I heard to lose your money.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that a bad one? 
[00:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  How bad?  The dealers should be charged with rape.  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  There's...  Thousand?  Uh...  Wow, really?  Thousand?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, in between?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Thousand.  Yeah.  Well, you got to let the folks out there know in general terms.  I know you don't like to get specific, but give them something they can understand.  Eh, probably a year's salary for someone that works at McDonald's.  How about you bought a new Toyota and just drove it in the lake? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I told everybody, watch this.  Yeah, that's okay.  That's pretty much it.  Drove it into the ocean, waited for high tide for the thing to just float out the sea.  And a new Toyota.  There you go.  So you had to...  Drove it into the lake.  That's pretty much it.  So you took a hit.  You took a hit down there.  Yeah, yeah.  I've never seen dealers pull out more blackjacks than this time around ever in my life. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  When do you quit?  Mm-hmm.  When do you go, all right, I lost enough?  Usually, you know, I use the force.  I just kind of get the feeling like things are turning and you got to leave.  The force would be Keith the cop, but he wasn't around to stop you.  Keith wasn't there.  Usually he has a guy around to stop him.  Now, let me tell you.  Time to go home.  You didn't take Keith with you?  No.  Why am I taking Keith?  I mean, he would have just been all right.  Nah.  Screw Keith.  Is that expensive?  That's not that expensive of a trip just to go. 
[00:11:00]  No.  I ain't going to take Keith.  Why am I taking Keith?  Keith and his-  Me and Jill.  Keith and his woman.  Just let him stay home.  Keith used to be your friend, remember?  He's still my friend.  He came here a couple months ago.  You guys were pals.  He's like my personal assistant.  Remember Supercar Weekend?  You guys were like Starsky and Hutch.  Personal assistant.  Now he's that-  Oh, the help.  Now when J.N. comes in, it's just like-  He's the help.  J.N.  Don't need you folding my socks, dude.  Just a minute.  Could you just leave?  Is he still cleaning your underwear at least?  Of course he is. 
[00:11:30]  All right.  Goes in, does my laundry.  He gets paid.  Anthony's trying to desperately hold on to regular guy-ness.  He gets paid well.  You took a right turn on Better Than You Street.  You took a right turn, and you try to, from time to time, you look over at one of the  guys' street, and they're like, hey, Anthony!  Roll the windows up. 
[00:12:00]  Keep going.  So a blackjack table's right at the pool?  Yeah, yeah.  That's insane.  Yep.  I had a pretty-  Right at the pool bar and all that, right there.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Nothing.  I wasn't betting crazy.  I couldn't get any traction at all.  Usually, if you could get a little traction at the beginning when you sit down and build  up a little pile, then you could play it.  I really wasn't getting any.  They were just raping me.  It helps the nerves if you could win early.  Yeah, yeah.  You win a little early, and then you know you're at the table.  You could pull back a little.  You could then kind of change your bets up a little more. 
[00:12:30]  It's a lot easier when you win at the beginning than when you're fighting the whole  way.  So this little place, do you have to pay to get in there, or is this a place where  don't go to escape?  Yep.  That's it.  Escape.  But it's not a place where you pay already, and then you're just in the cove.  That's where you are.  Nope.  You make reservations at the cove.  You got to get a wristband to go to the pool area.  You can't go into the pool area if you don't have a wristband.  Oh, you make reservations to go to the cove.  You got to reserve at the cove.  Yeah, yeah.  You reserve at the cove.  And what time was you gambling?  What time was gambling? 
[00:13:00]  Usually after dinner, so 10 o'clock at night.  Oh, so the pool was open.  Oh, no.  Not the pool table, the casino.  They actually have a casino there.  But during the day, I wasn't gambling during the day until the last day we were there.  I didn't even realize there were blackjack tables there.  Thank God.  Yeah, I know.  Exactly.  Thank God.  So, it was all about, like, this one situation that happened.  I had a 21, not a blackjack, but, you know, I pulled a 21, and the dealer's got a 4 showing, 
[00:13:30]  pulls over, you know, turns over that 10, 14, and then just hits a 7.  But you're thinking, I'm looking real good, obviously.  Yeah, of course.  When the dealer's showing a 14, you got a 21.  Anyone would think, all right, I got this.  You're looking good.  There's the 7, so we push.  And they have to hit on anything lower than 15, right?  No, it's 16, they got to hit.  17, they got to stay.  Okay, they stay, right.  So, I go, you know something?  Let's let it ride. 
[00:14:00]  So, boom, boom, I got a couple of kings out there.  So, now I'm holding a 20.  So, on a push, you're now sitting pretty with a 20?  Now I'm sitting with a 20.  Oh, my God.  Dealer, another 21.  Oh, my God.  Two 21s in a row, and that was the way everything went.  How much did that cost you, that hand?  That was like a couple of grand.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  That was a pretty good hand.  That's a tough way to lose right there.  The big hands, I was losing on all the big hands.  When I pulled back, I'd win a little bit here and there, but the big bets would take a dump. 
[00:14:30]  So, but, you know, it really, it wasn't, it wasn't about the crazy gambling like it usually is when I go to any place.  Oh, because you're in love.  Well, as Patrice says, JN.  JN was there, baby.  Was there, so.  And she sees some of that future money going out the window.  She's like, is this necessary?  See, back in the day, you had nothing to live for.  Nothing to live for. 
[00:15:00]  That's sort of what I was getting at.  And Anthony doesn't want to show all his cards yet in front of the new lady.  Well, no, because he's just trying to hang in there.  You have one last bit of Freon left in that air conditioning.  Mind of yours.  There's one last.  This is it for Anthony.  There's a screw left from back in the refrigerator when he used to fix the cooling system.  You're just like, I'm not going to.  That whole saying, remember where you came from. 
[00:15:30]  The whole saying is stupid.  It's based on, look, remember where you came from so you don't have to ever go back there.  It's not like, remember where you came from.  It's not stay there.  So I can just, you know, I grew up with roaches.  So let me have a pet roach just so I can get down to hers.  Forget it.  Hey, did you run into Eddie, the coconut man?  No, I didn't go to that side of the beach.  I stayed by the cove.  The cove's got a great beach.  That was scumbag days.  That was regular guy.  That's regular guy place.  This guy has been a regular guy place.  This guy has been making coconut drinks down there for, who knows? 
[00:16:00]  Who knows?  The beach at the cove was, there had to be three people on it.  And it's all nice and sandy.  They don't have like the big rocks like the other beach.  The other beach sucked.  I hated the other beach.  Pretty much.  That's why I've never gone back.  I think the place is amazing, but the beach sucked.  Now?  But now I got to check out this new side.  That place is the place.  Fresh, fresh, like right out the ocean, fish, all kinds of crazy stuff.  Yeah, good stuff.  Oh yeah.  They got big grouper fish and grouper.  Is it not grouper?  Yeah.  What's the one that they call the poor man's lobster? 
[00:16:30]  I don't know.  Anyway.  Good stuff.  They have those big giant fish that look like Edward G. Robbins.  They look like Edward G. Robbins.  Those are groupers.  Those are groupers, right?  Yeah.  They're just massive.  They're as big as that couch.  Oh, they're crazy.  You don't even know how they're still floating in the water.  Good stuff.  Yeah, the restaurants are great.  It was a good time, man.  We had a blast.  And college girls are plenty, huh?  Well, they were college girls that were celebrating their graduation by getting so intoxicated. 
[00:17:00]  It was hysterical to watch.  They're all in their bikinis dancing with some of these Bahama girls.  Well, they were in bikinis with their big fat asses.  Some guy twirling a two-edged torch.  It was like white.  It was like white.  The DJ's spinning and these girls are drinking.  And they're going to the bar.  They keep going back and getting drinks that were just multicolored. 
[00:17:30]  Drinking green stuff, red stuff, blue stuff.  And they're just slamming them.  And dancing on the couches and the tables.  And just getting hammered.  I'm looking gone.  You and JN were just sitting there just laughing at the kids.  Just laughing, looking gone.  They are going to be vomiting.  Projectile vomiting.  In like two hours.  Five years ago, he looked at that and was like, oh God, look at these young people.  Well, that's right.  He's like, look at the crazy kids.  Right, boo?  Look at them.  Boo!  That's why I said to Anthony in the office, I said two months ago, you would have joined him. 
[00:18:00]  And now you're watching from afar.  Now he's sitting on the beach with a martini bucket and two straws.  The love martini bucket.  Just looking at him.  Go, look at these.  Look at the children.  What are they doing?  All right, listen.  We've got to take our first break.  Wacky kids.  We'll talk more about the Bahamas.  Atlantis.  Also, we've got to talk about Imus messing up again.  This is all they're saying.  We've got the audio.  We're going to play it.  I don't know what to think.  I don't know either. 
[00:18:30]  We'll get into that after the break.  And the great George Carlin died yesterday.  Are you kidding?  We're off the air that George Carlin dies.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  He was a true friend of the show.  We met him back at NEW, what, eight years ago?  Something like that.  And he did our show over the years.  And he's just a great, great guy.  Always interesting when he came in to talk to us.  And he was just here a mere few months ago.  And regular news, you know, I was talking to somebody in regular news, they was like, 
[00:19:00]  they're not covering his death enough.  Hell no, they're not.  They are, though.  Hell no, they're not.  Just Tim Russert.  You know, I'm sure he was a nice guy, but George Carlin was way bigger than Tim Russert.  Tim Russert.  To us.  That's true.  But to the regular comedians are looked at as bums.  True.  And for him to even...  Look, Richard Jenney didn't even get...  I don't know if he was even on TMZ when he died.  But let's be honest.  Don't compare George Carlin to him.  I'm not comparing George Carlin.  I mean Richard Jenney to George Carlin.  I'm saying George Carlin, for the news to cover the way they did, even that was big 
[00:19:30]  for a comedian.  Yeah.  Dude, from a...  For a comedian.  From a cultural standpoint, George Carlin was one of the biggest ever.  The crap he did.  He's my second best ever.  Him and Pryor, that's it.  Oh, you have to go with the black guy first.  Comedy's dead now.  Comedy's dead.  I said it yesterday, George Carlin was the greatest comedian I've ever seen live.  He was second.  Who did you see?  You saw Pryor?  I'm saying saw live in an audience.  Well, Pryor was sick by the time I could ever see him. 
[00:20:00]  I mean, he was...  Was Carlin the greatest guy you saw live?  I never seen Carlin live either.  I didn't see Carlin live either.  Okay.  Who was the greatest comedian you ever saw live then?  I'm just laughing at boy George having to clean up and he's throwing the dirt at the  camera people that are filming him.  Yeah.  He's had it.  Well, think about that, Patrice.  We're going to go to...  Yeah, that's a good question.  We're going to talk about George Carlin all morning long as well.  We got a clip here.  Carlin on death.  It's perfect for today.  Creepy. 
[00:20:30]  He'd appreciate this.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Listen to this.  Geez, I hope I don't die.  Oh, by the way, you're all going to die.  I didn't mean to remind you of it, but it is on your schedule.  Won't come when you want.  It's always off a little.  What?  Now?  Here on the freeway?  Mm-hmm.  I thought surely I'd be home lying down. 
[00:21:00]  Some people think cacking out means to go to sleep.  Dying.  The big kakaroo.  We're all going to go?  When will it be?  You know, it should be, instead of sort of a fear thing, it should be sort of fun.  Kind of a, you know, the next big adventure.  We're going to find out where we go.  That's what we've all been talking about.  Where the hell do you go?  I don't know.  You must go somewhere, maybe.  Phil has an idea. 
[00:21:30]  I know.  I heard Phil.  Where do you go?  I don't know.  You're going to find out.  Hope it isn't nowhere, man.  Think you go where you think you're going to go.  Whatever you dwell on.  Did you ever hear those guys?  Oh, don't pray for me.  Don't waste your prayers on me.  I'm going to hell.  He is.  If Monty Hall dies, you'll probably go behind door number four. 
[00:22:00]  What do you think?  Suicide is for people who can't wait to find out where the hell it is here.  People say maybe you come back.  Reincarnation.  Do you think so?  Yeah.  Well, it doesn't seem mathematically possible to me, man.  Because at one time, what we had on the earth was six people, you know. 
[00:22:30]  I avoid two because it's controversial.  Six people with six souls.  Cool.  They died.  Souls went back to the place.  Six new people.  Souls.  Still six souls.  Now we have four billion people.  Claiming to have souls.  Someone is printing up souls.  And it lowers their value, you know.  Hey, good morning. 
[00:23:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Really quick, a little inside, but that's fine.  I'll help out everyone.  If you're like writing instant feedback, we get so much instant feedback.  We can only like scan this stuff.  So please, if you're writing into us, make sense.  With that, I read this instant feedback.  Jesus Opie.  Porsche?  Does Victoria's Secret have a hooker aisle?  What does that mean, dummy? 
[00:23:30]  What the F does that mean?  What does that mean, you idiot?  All I know is we were talking about Anthony's trip to Atlantis.  Mm-hmm.  We were talking about George Carlin a little bit.  Yeah.  We were talking about Patrice and his great stand-up comedy.  Yeah.  And this comes in.  What are you talking about?  It's...  People actually think they're making sense or that we're in on some inside joke that they're doing.  I don't know what that means.  I have no idea.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A. 
[00:24:00]  So Patrice, the greatest comedian you ever saw live.  You were in the audience.  Or you're at the side of a stage.  Or you're waiting to go on after him or before him.  Why bother?  Yakov Smirnoff.  End of story.  Thanks.  The best comic I ever seen.  This is a weird thing.  For me, like I said, it's prior Carlin and then people can fight for third.  I don't, you know.  Yeah.  The best live comic I ever seen was Dennis Wolfberg. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, God.  I know that sounds just ridiculous, but I used to work at a comedy club.  Yeah.  When I was coming up.  And you know Dennis Wolf.  Yeah, sure.  He...  To this day, I've never seen a better professional comedian.  But...  Wow.  Not anything in my heart, but just watching a guy work.  That's what I'm saying.  It's a big drop off from...  Yeah.  Like the best...  Okay, the best...  The best I've ever...  In my life.  And the reason Carlin's 2 and Pryor, they're... 
[00:25:00]  Really, they're 1 and 1A.  You know what I mean?  It's that Pryor, I thought he was godly funny.  Meaning if...  He was just God-blessed funny.  He just...  The material.  He could've just went up there.  He was humble.  He was...  I mean, he just talked about things.  He never was preachy.  He was poignant without trying to be.  Well...  And Carlin was...  He was as good at communicating.  Like, anybody could talk about not believing in God and deal with that uncomfortable. 
[00:25:30]  They were amazing, both the same in a certain way.  But I just think Pryor was...  If you could say, okay, that's what funny is, if you see it, that's Pryor.  You know, you brought up a good point in there somewhere.  There's a lot of comedians that aren't funny.  They have a funny act, but they're not funny people.  Like, Richard Pryor was a funny person.  George Carlin was a funny person.  There are guys...  And I'm not gonna name names, because that just wouldn't be... 
[00:26:00]  Well, funny, the first word is fun.  But we...  We're lucky enough to, you know, get a lot of, you know, the comedians rolling through  our studio.  And there are a lot of them.  Not a lot.  There's a bunch of them that aren't funny.  They have a funny act, though.  They have figured out how to get, you know, an hour, 45 minutes of stuff that when they're  doing it on the stage, you look at that person and go, wow, that's a funny person.  That's why I'm not...  No, it's a funny act.  As a person, though, he's not funny.  I don't like comics who aren't funny.  But she...  Well, there's a lot... 
[00:26:30]  There's a bunch of them out there.  You're lucky enough to be around a lot of comics who are funny.  Like, and not...  And just because whether you think they're funny or not doesn't matter.  Like, there's some dudes that I don't think are funny, but I know they're funny dudes.  Like, funny is a part of their life.  Right.  They love being around something that makes them...  That's fun.  Right, right, right.  You know, most of the guys, man.  And a lot of comics, just you go, ugh.  You go, funny...  This is not something you have to do.  This is something you decided to do. 
[00:27:00]  And that's why bad comics make me sick, is because I never watched Pryor, and I never  watched Carlin.  People go, did they influence you?  I go, no.  I didn't watch Carlin and Pryor and go, I can do that.  I watched them and went, oh my God, this is an amazing thing.  Yeah.  So I always said I would have did comedy with or without them, because they didn't influence  me to go, you know, do that.  Right.  Sure, sure.  Like, these guys now, again, nameless, you just go, I can do... I'm just as funny as...  Well, what I hate... 
[00:27:30]  What I hate is if I go to Caroline's and I see someone that is coming through and it's  been six months, eight months, and they're doing word for word the exact same set they  did the last time I saw.  How can you do that?  They do it, though.  You...  That's why I brought up, you know, seeing you to start this show today.  It was amazing.  How can you...  It was a completely different set.  Anthony, who was the greatest comedian you ever saw live?  Ever.  Saw.  Live.  Not on TV. 
[00:28:00]  You're in the audience and you're just there.  Yeah, probably, um, Carlin.  Carlin.  Back, you know, at Westbury Music Fair, back in like, Jesus Christ, probably in 83 or something  like that.  In the round.  Yeah, in the round.  George Carlin in the round with his old ass.  Looking at you every once in a while.  Yeah.  Alright, moving on.  We got Mr. Imus in a bit of trouble this morning.  Yeah.  Getting coverage all over the place, man. 
[00:28:30]  All over the place.  What do you think?  Fired or so completely fired?  I don't know what to think of this one.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Because I think...  I...  I...  The first time it's screwed up, I still don't see it.  Sorry, I don't.  They don't.  They've been playing that clip all morning long.  We're not allowed to play it on radio, even though we're trying to discuss this like a  news station would discuss it.  Yeah, they can play it on the news.  But if we play it on our radio show, they'll dump out of it and then we'll have to have  a meeting and who needs that when you want to get, you know, out of the city right after 
[00:29:00]  the show.  But, uh, I don't know.  I think this one, if...  He's explaining it one way, but I think this is worse if he...  How can I explain this, Patrice?  Help me out.  Like he said...  Well, let's just play it.  We'll start.  This is what Ima said yesterday.  This is back Adam Pacman Jones, recently signed by the Cowboys.  Here's a guy suspended all of 2007 following their shooting at a Vegas nightclub. 
[00:29:30]  Well, stuff happens.  You're in a nightclub, for God's sake.  What do you think is going to happen at a nightclub?  People are drinking and doing drugs?  Yeah.  There are women there and people have guns.  So, there, go ahead.  Well, he's also...  He's been arrested six times since being drafted by Tennessee in 2005.  What color is he?  He's African-American.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  Now we know.  Well... 
[00:30:00]  Well, there you go.  Well, there you go.  He's claiming that he said that because, well, they're arresting him a lot because he's black.  I think he's being sarcastic.  I hear a lot of sarcasm, especially in that first part where he's talking about, well,  you know, what do you expect?  You go in a club and people are drinking and there's girls there and guns.  You're going to have shootings.  What's the problem?  Like he's doing this whole, as a matter of fact, as a matter of factly kind of a, hey, 
[00:30:30]  yeah, the club, well, of course, there's going to be gunfire.  What are you, crazy?  And then he goes into the thing.  What color is he?  He's black.  Well, of course, sure he is.  Like he's...  I catch a lot of sarcasm in what he's saying here.  Well, I don't think it's going to be picked up like that, especially with the, you know,  the likes of Al Sharpton.  Right.  Patrice?  I'm not sure, man.  Sure, man.  I'm kind of there with you.  I'm right.  I'm right in the middle.  You know what?  Like I'm always my, like I, the first thing I always do is put myself in a bad spot. 
[00:31:00]  I put myself in the spot of the dude that's not trying to get fired.  Right.  He's an old man trying his best not to get fired.  Right.  The old school incident, he was not an old man trying not to get fired.  So, you know, there he's trying, he's probably not going to make a racial, it's possible he  was trying to say, well, they bugging him because he's black.  That could have been an indictment on society. 
[00:31:30]  I mean, I know that's going deep.  It's amazing.  They're spinning it that way immediately.  They've, they've already put out a statement that said, that's what he meant.  He's just possible.  He's like, well, he's black and people are going to bother him because he's been arrested  six times because he's a black guy that hangs out at bars and he's a professional athlete.  They're bothering him.  If I had said it, I don't know if that would have, they might've took it like that.  But again, he has a, he has a history.  History.  I say this, uh, the democratic, um, nominee for president of the United States is black 
[00:32:00]  man.  So anything goes now.  I must say whatever he wants.  Screw it.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Why do you get to pass?  And we're off.  In this corner.  And here we go.  It only took 40 minutes today.  I'm kidding.  Come on.  You will be exhausted.  Like I will.  No. 
[00:32:30]  Of course.  The point I guess I was trying to make if, uh, with, with Imus's history, like Patricia  said, why wouldn't you make that perfectly clear?  Like, wouldn't you have a filter in your head the whole time?  Like, oh my God, I almost got fired for being, you know, a racist, blah, blah, blah.  I just said this controversial thing.  I know I meant because he's black.  Right.  He's getting arrested and they're bothering him a lot.  Maybe I should tell people that after that statement.  Mm-hmm.  But he's like, ah, there you go.  Imus is not, look, again.  I would have made it perfectly clear is what I'm saying. 
[00:33:00]  How old is he?  He's, uh, he's about George Carlin's age.  He's an old guy.  Yeah.  And, and another thing, this is all I'm saying is, is like, you have to believe that he's  a complete liar to, to not, you know, accept anything.  Mm-hmm.  I just, I can't believe he's dumb.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  But he's an old man.  And sometimes you ever have, um, inner dialogue where, where you're just not listening to anything  but yourself.  And then you have a quiet conversation with yourself and you're sitting there like, like 
[00:33:30]  the dude is reading the thing and he's on.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, I'm sorry.  And then he goes, oh, you get, you get shot at them.  Yeah.  Cause he goes, what's wrong with going to, to the thing there.  And then he's like, in his mind, he's just still going, boy, was he in his mind?  This is a question he asked himself.  Right.  What, what color was he?  What color is this guy?  Uh, he, and evidently he don't know who the hell Pac-Man Jones is to even ask what  color Pac-Man Jones is.  You know what?  He knows who Pac-Man Jones is.  Do you think Imus knows and knew he was black before he even asked that question? 
[00:34:00]  He worked on a sports station for way too long not to pick up a thing or two.  If he knew that black Pac-Man Jones was black.  He had to have known.  Then there, there could be an issue.  He had to have known.  Because like us, I mean, you know, you're reading the papers in the morning.  So, I mean, if that was the story of the day, there's probably a picture of the guy.  Picture of him.  Come on.  Trying to figure out immediately how it can't be racist in certain situations.  Yeah, yeah.  Kind of trying to.  And that's the thing about the damn president, again, why I want a black president. 
[00:34:30]  Uh huh.  So that I can allow white people to have an opinion about a black president.  Well.  A black presidential candidate.  Right now, if white people have an opinion about him, I just immediately go, you're racist.  Well, right.  Uh, I'm as disgusted as already on his show.  We're getting the audio.  So he, he discussed it and he's moving on, but we'll, we'll play what he, what he meant.  Really?  He's moving on.  Well, wow.  A lot of balls there to just move on there, Ms. Imus.  Move on from this whole, uh, uh, uh, thing here.  Uh. 
[00:35:00]  Let's move on.  I said, I'm sorry.  He apologized like a black woman.  No.  I said I was sorry.  He's in the studio here.  What is, um, uh, what color is he?  Uh, black.  Ah, that's right.  Uh, he's a ****.  Yeah.  I gotta bleep myself because, uh, sometimes I say stupid things and, uh, I get the, uh,  all, um, up my ****.  So I gotta watch what I say.  Yeah.  Uh.  Pac-Man?  Uh, Mr. Imus. 
[00:35:30]  Pac-Man was yellow, not black.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, baby.  Uh, Mr. Imus?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Revan Al Sharpton's gonna have a statement in the next couple of days.  He's gonna look into this.  This latest faux pas.  He could, uh, kiss my black ass is what he could do.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, shut up, jerk.  You don't have a black ass.  No, he does.  Big fat **** ass.  That's what I call him.  At home with the doors shut.  The lights out.  Soundproof room. 
[00:36:00]  I have my **** room.  That I, uh, go into.  Is that known as?  It's the **** room that I just go into and scream that word over and over again.  Well, other people would call it a panic room, sir.  It's, uh, completely, um, soundproofed.  Yeah.  And after every day, I go in and just scream the word **** over and over again as loud as I can.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  In your panic room.  Yeah, yeah.  A panic room.  In public, there would be a lot of panic.  Yeah.  I do call it the **** room, though.  Yeah, I understand. 
[00:36:30]  I'm just cleaning it up for you so you don't get in more trouble.  It's Imus.  It's not Anthony.  You can't get in trouble doing this voice.  You're speaking of characters.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know how that's pretty funny.  What?  Does my garage say dead Pac-Man storage?  Because storing dead Pac-Man ain't my business, jewels.  Ha ha ha!  Wow.  It's going to happen if my wife comes home. 
[00:37:00]  I'm going to get divorced.  Yeah.  I don't want to get divorced.  You've got to call some people.  You're on pop culture.  Walter, a movie from what?  How long ago was that movie?  The Iron Man's Eye.  Let it be known that the black man is feeding Ima some lines for this bit.  What?  Thank you.  No, it's fine.  I'm quoting Pulp Fiction.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, baby.  Take your foot off the... 
[00:37:30]  Ah, that Quentin uses that word a lot.  He likes that word.  It certainly does.  Jesus Christ.  I think you like that word, too, Mr. Ima.  Yeah, I love using it.  That's why I go into my panic room.  It's a panic.  Never invited anybody in there.  And I yell that word so loud and so clear.  And I have a few pictures up in there.  River Nile. 
[00:38:00]  Right.  And I just yell at them all the time.  Mr. Ima, this is a great line coming in from Steve from Bayshore,  but I'm too scared to even say it.  Really?  Because they're listening to us right now.  But you know, Pac-Man is a video game.  Yeah.  Old school video game.  There might be another old school video game out there that we could reference with that.  Uh, Donkey Kong.  Well, I wasn't going to say it.  How's your Donkey Kong?  I used to say that all the time.  How's your Donkey Kong? 
[00:38:30]  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I did hear that, um, uh, Reverend Al is very upset with me.  And, um, he's going to be throwing barrels at me.  No, he's not.  Uh.  That's not what he does.  Oh.  I do.  Sorry.  I apologize for that.  Yeah.  I'm sorry I said that.  Pfft.  Come on.  Hey, there's something coming in that are just completely off limits. 
[00:39:00]  Of course.  God, I hope Obama wins.  I can say all this stuff.  Free reign?  What do you think?  Not at all.  No, not at all.  You don't see, uh, those mainstream media using the N-word and going back to just saying  it instead of, you know, saying the N-word.  Hell no.  It'll be much worse.  All right, listen, we've got to take another break.  It'll be much worse.  Yeah, we've got to, we're going to get the Imus, uh, explanation after the break. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  We've got Patrice O'Neal sitting in for Jim Norton today.  Are you promoting anything there?  I'll be at the Houston Improv on, uh, uh, uh, July 4th, 5th, and 6th.  You're doing the Improv tour.  Houston, uh, Texas?  Houston, Texas.  Be careful.  They don't like s*** down there.  What, they don't like Pac-Mans?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what I meant.  I'm sorry I said that.  I apologize that I said that.  All right, we're going to go to break with the F.U. Line. 
[00:40:00]  We'll continue.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. Line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  You have six new voice messages.  First voice message.  Yeah, I want to give a big F.U. to my wife for wrecking our f***ing truck on the first  day of our vacation.  I bust my ass all year long just to freaking have one week of f***ing peace.  And on the first day of our f***ing vacation, you had to go and rerend a f***ing tractor 
[00:40:30]  trailer.  F*** you, you stupid bitch.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a big F.U. to my soon-to-be ex-husband who can't keep an f***ing job and  is a pathological liar who's off and on the goddamn wagon making empty promises and making  my house foreclose.  F.U.  Next message.  Hey, I'd like to give a big F.U. to Mitchell.  You ate all my f***ing food.  Next message.  I'd like to send a big F.U. out to the fat f*** that didn't give me the job.  I hope you get a yeast infection and die in a fire. 
[00:41:00]  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a big F.U. to the Little League coaches here in Gillette because they  suck.  We were winning 11-0.  Coach pulls my kid out for three innings and we lose 11-13.  I want to give a big f*** you to all the Gillette f***suckers.  Later.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to leave a big F.U. to my ex-girlfriend.  You gained 30 pounds in a f***ing year and you expect me to f*** you, you sloppy bitch.  Go f*** yourself, you f***ing f***ing you. 
[00:41:30]  Goodbye.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  How's everybody this morning?  On this twofer Tuesday.  Twofer.  We got a twofer from the Black Crows on your home of rock and roll.  Ah, shut up.  877-212-O&A.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:42:00]  Getting back into it.  Took yesterday off.  All hell broke loose because we took a day off, by the way.  What happened?  Ah, they're bitching and complaining everywhere.  Why?  Jesus.  Because we took a day off.  Oh, perish the thought.  We take a day.  You know, as far as a radio show goes, we don't take a lot of time off.  Not as much as other radio shows.  I can't tell you how many times over the years management has actually come to us 
[00:42:30]  and went, ah, you guys need to, like, you know, take some vacation time.  Yeah.  Take some days.  I think officially we get anywhere between four and six weeks a year off.  I think it's close to six weeks.  I remember the time when the boss told us to take two years off.  I think that's why we don't take a lot of time off in general.  We're afraid.  If we're away from the studio too long, we'd just assume they're, you know,  hosing the area down and getting ready for the next morning's zoo. 
[00:43:00]  Slappy and Wappy show.  So relax.  We're back.  But next week we won't be.  Next week we got a short week.  What?  What?  Oh, we're heading toward the 4th of July weekend, my friend.  That's true.  Yes.  And see, we're smart because they're giving us the 4th off.  So then we're taking only a couple days around that,  and then we still can take a real vacation later this summer.  Yeah.  See, we just take a few days.  Right.  It's not a vacation.  It's a few days. 
[00:43:30]  Officially, we're taking two days off next week,  but that means we're missing three shows.  Right.  Hey, it's summer.  Leave us alone.  Exactly.  Yesterday, though, I mean, not yesterday, Friday,  was almost the end of the Opie and Anthony show.  What happened?  Well, you left early.  All right.  To catch a plane.  What are you laughing at, Patrice?  The setup made me laugh. 
[00:44:00]  What?  I'm just waiting for what y'all got to say.  Well, Anthony left early.  Charlie had to catch a flight to Atlantis,  and we had Tippi Tom, our homeless friend.  What did he say now?  He didn't say anything.  It was awful.  And he wasn't the homeless guy that got us in trouble.  That was Homeless Charlie, who I think the government killed  because we haven't seen him since.  That's true.  We haven't seen Homeless Charlie since.  We saw him one day.  He was a huge fan of the show. 
[00:44:30]  We've never talked about this.  Let's talk about this for a second.  He's walking around.  I know he's doing it.  But Homeless Charlie...  Last time you seen him, an Indian threw a water fountain  through a window and was running down.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me set this up, though.  Homeless Charlie also met us outside XM.  He was cracking us up.  Huge fan of the show, even though he was homeless.  He comes up, and he gives us an hour of amazing radio.  Some people were saying he was like the homeless version  of Richard Pryor.  The guy had wit, and he was quick,  and he was just da, da, da. 
[00:45:00]  He said some crazy things that got us suspended for 30 days.  He made some type of sexual threats  against certain female world leaders and dignitaries.  And stupid us, we thought that we can't possibly get in trouble for this.  It's the rantings of a madman.  Rantings of a homeless guy.  Why couldn't you just let this guy go off  and give people a little window inside what goes on in a homeless guy's mind? 
[00:45:30]  And we assumed everyone would understand that,  but of course they don't understand that  because they're just out there, these brief parts.  Our assumptions stink.  And the rest of them, Politico.  Politico's the new one that got Imus all this attention today.  They saw it a different way, and they tried to get us fired,  and thank God we didn't get fired, but we did get suspended for 30 days.  The point being, though, Homeless Charlie, huge fan of the show.  We haven't seen him since, so I'm starting to think the CIA kind of took him out. 
[00:46:00]  You think that's what happened?  Yeah, I think he's...  They cut out his brain!  I have no idea what happened to Homeless Charlie.  We haven't seen him since.  No one has seen him since.  I just need to know the guy is still out there being homeless and stuff.  Maybe the government relocated him.  You think that's what...  It was part of the relocation program.  A black van just pulled up.  They threw him in and it speeds off.  He's never seen or heard from again.  By the way, who is working the filler clips at XM today? 
[00:46:30]  That'd be Butcher.  Oh, boy.  Butcher, you are so fired.  You are so fired.  Oh, boy.  What did he do?  And, Steve, you are a dummy.  Oh, boy.  Because what I'm setting up here is a clip that they just played over at XM as filler.  Why would they throw that in as filler?  Why would they throw that in as filler?  Oh.  I just need people around me that understand how radio works.  We're going to be replaying this today, you dummies. 
[00:47:00]  What was it?  So, now I apologize to the XMers because we have to play this again.  They just heard it?  They just heard it.  Oh, my God.  We got dummies that work for us.  What is it?  Like, how did they know...  Why would you just...  This is way too inside, trust.  Oh, boy.  This is like Radio 101.  Radio 101 crap.  You just don't throw this radio gold out there while we're in a commercial break on regular radio. 
[00:47:30]  There's a whole thing that comes with it.  We got Anthony back in studio for the first time since we did that.  Oh, so they played that?  Yes!  Stunt brain.  How long have you been working on radio?  Help me out here because people are sick of me bitching and complaining, but...  20 years.  Radio 101.  Yeah.  It's obvious what happened Friday was going to be replayed and relived when Anthony returned.  Right.  Because I even read the emails saying that it's going to be replayed. 
[00:48:00]  And you saw some new equipment in the studio.  Yes, yes.  I'm very happy to have...  Don't even...  We're still setting it up for the people that haven't heard it.  Yeah.  So where's Steve?  Why would Steve allow this to happen?  My prediction?  Steve blames the entire thing on Butcher.  But he's the executive producer.  Yeah, but I bet.  Why is Butcher playing what we're about to play here with Anthony in the studio?  I completely agree with you.  And we've had a system in place for months.  Why that system can't function, I don't... 
[00:48:30]  Get him off the board.  I'm dead serious.  I understand.  Have him make fucking coffee.  Oh, jeez.  What?  Oh, the language.  Have him make coffee.  Fine.  We need someone that understands the basic ABCs or radio.  We've got...  We've even got fail-safes in place.  We're in the radio battle of our lives.  We've got fail-safes in place.  The fail-safes aren't paying attention.  And I'm looking at the fail-safe right now.  Why?  Tell him to take a cooking class.  He can make breakfast for us every morning.  Oh.  That hurts.  We'll get some hot plates and he can make omelets. 
[00:49:00]  Holy...  It'll get done.  We have 20 guys working behind the scenes.  Get one that understands what we're about.  It'll get done.  Stunt brain is shaking his head.  He understands exactly what I'm talking about.  It shouldn't have been played.  It shouldn't have been played.  You don't just throw that crap out there like,  Ah, here it is.  Blah.  So, I apologize to the X-Amers,  but I gotta go down this road.  I have to do this.  Even though you just heard this.  But at least now you'll get a little something-something  because Anthony's back and he could comment.  Get him off the board. 
[00:49:30]  Yep.  I'm serious.  If he's just throwing that crap in there,  he doesn't know what he's doing.  Sorry, Butcher.  You don't know what you're doing.  You work hard, but you don't know what you're doing.  Anyway, Anthony left early.  Yep.  And I was listening.  And Tippi Tom was in studio.  And I was thinking that it would be fun to have Tippi Tom  sit where Anthony sits. 
[00:50:00]  I was listening to the show.  And I knew that was going to happen.  At first, you invited Tippi Tom to sit somewhere else.  You said, Tom, why don't you sit?  Oh, I heard you go, Tom, why don't you take a seat?  And then you said, on the bleachers,  in the middle of the bleachers.  Right, right.  Because we have a live audience over there.  Right.  And it was packed.  And Tippi Tom smells pretty bad.  And it was upsetting to the people.  So it's funny to us.  But at that point, I thought you were going to tell him 
[00:50:30]  to sit in my chair.  So I'm listening, going, oh, whew.  Okay.  Skated that time.  Then I heard, oh, wait a minute.  I got an idea.  It was something.  And I knew it was coming.  I went, oh, no.  Here's where they put a stinky homeless guy.  And you can't, I can't describe the smell, people.  You can't, you ever walk by, you're walking down a sidewalk  and there's bushes on the side  and you know that there's a dead animal in those bushes  because it's that pungent smell of death. 
[00:51:00]  That's what Tom smells like on a good day.  And I knew he was going to sit that funky ass down in my chair  and then start fumbling with my accoutrement.  Well, what describes the smell perfectly is the fact that,  like you said, we have bleachers and we had a full house.  We had standing room only.  There was 20, 30 people standing around.  Where Tom was sitting on the bleachers,  people refused to sit in that section of the bleachers.  Yeah.  So, like, there was easily 10 to 12 spots  that people could have been sitting, 
[00:51:30]  but they chose not to because the smell was that bad.  He has a smell force field around him.  Right.  And no one can penetrate.  We can put a picture up of Tippy Tom on onaradio.com.  You could smell him by just looking at the picture.  Yeah.  It's there.  You took it on Friday.  It's in Opie's eye, but I'll move it.  All right.  Very good.  So, anyway, yeah, I decided that Tippy needed to sit in Anthony's chair  because Anthony, you know, went home early.  And, you know, Tippy Tom's disgusting,  but Anthony really, really finds him disgusting. 
[00:52:00]  I don't like him getting closer than probably 15 feet to me.  Right.  If he gets within that 15-foot range, I scream.  I tell Keith to move him.  I get him out of the way.  I get up and move.  I don't like him being around me because the smell.  And, you know something?  I'm not a fan of things like head lice, rickets, emphysema, whatever else he's got, shingles, the ninja. 
[00:52:30]  The ninja.  He might have the ninja.  He might have the ninja.  He says he doesn't have the ninja.  But, anyway, here's the moment where we decided to have Tippy Tom sit in Anthony's chair.  And by the reaction, you can tell that this is not a good idea.  And also, if you know the show and if you know Anthony, you know this was not a good idea.  And I'm listening, and it's really a horrible feeling to listen to this  and be powerless to do anything about it. 
[00:53:00]  Like, I wasn't in the studio.  I'm in my vehicle.  I'm driving, listening, and horrified that this is going on.  Even when Tippy Tom comes in this huge studio we're broadcasting from now,  Anthony will run all the way over to where E-Rock sits.  He just doesn't want anything to do with Tippy Tom.  So, for Tippy Tom sitting in his chair, not good.  Just him sitting in the chair would have been the worst thing ever.  And then it just got progressively worse.  I got an idea, Tippy.  How are you doing?  I got this idea.  It might be a little crazy.  I don't know.  But Anthony had to leave the show early today. 
[00:53:30]  He's going down to the Bahamas with Joe Nicolini.  Oh, that's good news.  Why don't you come on in here, Tippy?  Goddamn, Tom.  He's so upbeat.  Poor bastard.  That's good news.  That's good news.  It might be a little crazy.  I don't know.  But Anthony had to leave the show early today.  He's going down to the Bahamas with Joe Nicolini.  Oh, that's good news.  Why don't you come on in here, Tippy?  Yeah!  Come on in, Tippy. 
[00:54:00]  Listen to the effing crowd.  Come on in.  Come on.  Anthony's chair.  Anthony's chair.  Oh, ****.  Tippy.  He's a man.  Tippy, I want you.  All right.  That's goddamn good news.  You're leaving the room here.  This is great news.  I want you to sit.  I'm so damn happy.  I want you to sit in Anthony's chair.  Yeah, the big, comfy chair.  Make yourself comfortable, Tippy.  I feel like talking.  Let's hear it for Tippy Tom sitting in Anthony's chair.  Yeah.  There you go. 
[00:54:30]  There you go, Anthony.  It's the Tippy.  I'm all cleaned up just for you.  Tippy, it's the opiate Tippy Tom show.  Beautiful.  Here you go.  There's your mic.  Hey, I can try out some of your equipment.  Hey, it's my new song.  Wait, play that whistle for everybody. 
[00:55:00]  Hold on, hold on.  I'm going to get it right.  There you go.  I am my whistle.  There you go.  There you go.  Tippy Tom.  Sitting in Anthony's seat.  By the way, the video is up on YouTube.  Sam got it up there this morning.  The search is Tippy Tom sits in Anthony's chair.  I believe we'll link it to onaradio.com as well.  You know what's been in his mouth? 
[00:55:30]  And he's playing my friggin' slide whistle.  Yeah.  And you're listening to this in your car, right?  Yeah.  Again, powerless.  You had to be losing your mind.  I was going crazy.  And powerless to do anything about it.  Yeah.  He is such a disturbing individual to have around you.  The smell.  The sights.  Knowing that he's constantly reaching and grabbing at himself through those disgusting underwear.  And there he is, touching all my stuff. 
[00:56:00]  And Anthony finally had it, and he decided to call into the show.  I had to.  Hi, who's this?  We had Tippy Tom answer the phone.  I had to get that animal out of my fucking face.  No.  I.  I.  The animal's not here now.  I will not.  I will not use any of those things again.  I want everything disinfected.  The entire side of the studio.  And I will not sit in that chair. 
[00:56:30]  You're fired.  You're out of business now, buddy.  You're fired.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What I don't understand is why he ain't playing no rock and roll around.  I knew this was going to happen, too.  The second I left, I'm like, why haven't they sat him in my seat? 
[00:57:00]  I know these s***s are going to do that.  He's having a ball over there.  He's touching everything.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  How is a guy like that homeless, man, with the wit he has?  Yeah, that's wit.  He's got other stuff that rhymes with wit in his pants.  That's why he's homeless.  Look how homeless he looks in your chair.  Look how homeless he looks in your chair.  That's the only way to describe it.  And so homeless.  Get some of these pictures up on onaradio.com for the folks. 
[00:57:30]  He's just a piece of wit.  He certainly is.  And then it continued.  Tom, don't put your mic.  Your mouth is not far enough.  You have to move your mouth closer to the microphone.  Yeah, get closer to the mic so he can hear you.  Get closer to the mic, Tom.  He can't hear you.  I got the headphones on.  Yeah, but get closer to him.  His lips are touching it.  Now I know everything I can't use anymore.  The mic, I'm taking the mic off and throwing it in the garbage.  Is your name Mike?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Where you been, Mike? 
[00:58:00]  You're an f***ing bomb.  You might think about getting rid of the chair, too.  You're starting to piss me off, Mike.  When I get pissed off, I turn into the Hulk.  And I swear to God, I will come after you.  He is turning into the Hulk.  Look at his legs are green.  Well, have fun with Tippi Tom.  I'm going to go to the Bahamas.  Hey, Tom.  Oh!  Hey!  Throw away everything in that studio. 
[00:58:30]  Can I go?  You want to go to the Bahamas with me?  Yeah, why not?  Wouldn't that be great?  I could just ditch him there and have him swim back.  Yeah!  And you get to enjoy my company.  Hey, Tom.  He is a funny guy.  Sitting in your chair doing it, man.  Look at him.  He looks very comfortable.  Oh, look at him.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  He knows his way around a microphone.  And he's just touching your slide with all your toys. 
[00:59:00]  I know.  I think we got the megaphone here, too.  We got one more clip to play.  What?  You have to adjust the Paltalk cameras with that handle right there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because I want to...  Nobody can see.  What about that?  Let me spray alone.  No, get rid of that.  Every time he touched something, the audience groaned because they just know how you are.  We don't like dirty, filthy, homeless people to begin with.  But you really don't like them.  Mm-hmm.  Right there.  Because I want to...  Nobody can see.  Jesus.  Come on, man.  Let me spray alone. 
[00:59:30]  No, get rid of that.  He's even touching the scent thing.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  Oh, what's this for here?  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  Hey, somehow, his sound effects are very appropriate.  Anyway.  That was Rocky Picture Horror Show.  Well, have fun.  Rocky Picture Horror Show.  I got to go.  Where you going?  Rocky Picture Horror Show.  Where you going? 
[01:00:00]  Where you going?  Where you going?  Thank you.  Yeah.  There you go.  There's Anthony on his way to the Bahamas.  And that was Rocky Picture Horror Show.  It's wrong of him.  It's great.  He's disgusting and fantastic.  I saw that the boys got you all new toys, and they were waiting for you as soon as you  got in today.  They were still in their boxes just to prove that they were brand new.  New wacky horn.  A much better slide whistle. 
[01:00:30]  See?  That one sucks.  No, no, no.  Look, look.  This is the universal sound of, you know.  I like it.  It's more Brady Bunch.  Yeah?  Oh, let me see.  I can't go fast.  I need some grease.  I need a little earl.  I need a little lube.  Got to lube up your whistle.  Got to lube up my whistle.  New bell?  Let's say hi to Tara in Jersey. 
[01:01:00]  Tara, what's up?  OMG.  Oh, my God.  I can't even hear you guys.  I can't even talk.  I need your help.  Why?  Yeah?  Well, I have a lot of men problems, and I can't even believe I'm on the freaking radio.  I actually never called you guys ever, and the first time I got through.  All right.  I've been drinking Heineken since all night.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't you have work today?  Yeah, I do.  But that's not until later. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, I have a job.  You've been up all night drinking Heinekens?  Yeah, I guess for a bit, and now I'm calling you guys.  All right.  What seems to be the problem?  Well, I can't speak because I've got men issues.  What's your men issues?  We're here to help, and we've got Patrice O'Neill here, so he could probably straighten  you right out.  What's the problem?  Well, no, I can't find a man to actually tame me.  You can't find a man to tame you? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, I need supervision.  Because you're pretty wild?  I am super independent, and I can't find anybody that can actually stick around and deal with  me.  By super independent, do you mean you're slutty?  You have sex with a lot of guys?  What do you do?  No, actually, I'm very good at it, but I'm very selective, and so many of them want me.  So why do the guys leave you? 
[01:02:30]  It doesn't sound like you should be selective if you're drinking Heineken's all night long.  I mean, you do realize it's Tuesday morning, right?  And what drugs are you on?  I am on nothing.  No, you're on drugs.  What drug are you on?  This isn't just on...  Anti-drowsiness medication?  What?  Anti-drowsiness medication?  What is anti-drowsy medication? 
[01:03:00]  I don't know.  You've got to figure it out.  They cause drowsiness.  Also known as Coke?  Why don't you just say you're on Coke?  I'm not.  Meth?  Anti-drowsy nose powder.  Yeah.  This is more than a Heineken buzz.  The way it smells, yeah.  This is more than a Heineken buzz.  What's the anti-drowsy medication?  Is it crystal meth?  No.  Oh, no way.  I never touched that.  What is the anti-drowsy medication you're on? 
[01:03:30]  You said it.  I'm not incriminating myself.  Oh, Coke.  All right.  Done a little Coke.  You said it.  I'm not incriminating myself.  But you said it.  You did say it.  You couldn't have guessed it right.  I never said anything.  You said it.  Well, we understand.  So let me get this straight.  You're looking for a guy that wants to deal with some whore that likes the nose candy  and drinking Heinekens all night long on a Monday night.  Are you talking to Sosa on the other line?  No.  I actually am closet and nobody even knows I do that. 
[01:04:00]  I have to dabble here and there.  I hate to tell you, sweetie, but everyone knows you do it.  Probably.  We knew and we don't know anything about you.  It took us, what, two minutes to know everything about you?  On the phone.  Do you think I would actually talk to somebody else and go out in public any other time than  this?  No.  Well, I don't know, but...  How are you going to find a man that wants to deal with this crap?  Well, I...  I mean, you could...  I'm sure you could find another addict.  She's blaming men for not taming her. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, for not taming her.  What do you need?  Do you have a MySpace?  If alligators can speak, oh, I can't find anybody to stop.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Swallowing people whole.  It's your fault you can't stop me from being a drunk.  Hey, maybe it's your fault, beautiful.  Yeah.  It is, actually.  Why don't you just...  You can nail on it.  Why don't you just try to be wanted?  So what are you looking...  Tara.  Justin.  Tara. 
[01:05:00]  What are you looking for?  Happiness.  Another half a gram.  Happiness at the bottom of those bottles.  Is happiness there?  No.  Yeah, you know, the Heinekens are in a side.  They just take the edge off.  No kidding.  Yeah.  What, do you think we were born yesterday?  We know this.  Do you drink two at a time, one in each corner of your mouth?  Just...  Okay.  So you don't live in a glass house then, right?  So you don't throw stones.  Oh, boy.  Shut up with that crap.  Now you're just saying old...  Come on.  Old Testament. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Those who live in glass houses, shut it.  What's your job?  You know what?  I find that I'm normally...  Actually, because I'm so effed up right now, and that's a fact...  Whatever.  But other than this...  What do you look like, you animal?  What do I look like?  Yeah.  You sound about 40 plus.  Someone is suggesting you need Mike Tyson to tame your ass.  Yeah, he'll do it.  A couple of body blows.  How old are you?  40 what?  No, I like it rough, but I don't like... 
[01:06:00]  I don't need a right hook in his face, and I don't like that.  Yeah.  How old are you?  40 what?  30.  30.  So you're about 35.  All right.  So you're about 35.  What's your job?  No woman admits they're real age, so you're easily 35.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what's fucked up about people, because all you...  Oh, my God.  Because I can't stand the rest of...  Like, every moron, stupid...  Whatever.  So what you're tired of is people thinking you're 40, but you're really 30? 
[01:06:30]  No, actually, they think in, you know, whatever.  That's everybody's problem.  But actually, I go for normally 26.  I'm brunette right now, so...  There's nothing young about her voice.  She's done a lot of damage to her.  No.  No, you can just hear it.  No, I look my age, and...  But you've done a lot of damage, though.  Yeah.  What's your job that you're barely hanging on to?  What's your job?  She's a mud-wrestling referee.  I'm actually going to go to... 
[01:07:00]  I'm going to school for a mortuary school.  Mortuary school.  Maybe you can find a man there.  A necrophiliac.  Yeah.  There's a lot of good-looking dead guys.  There's a lot of ghouls that hang around the funeral home.  I'm talking about the live ones.  It's the only stiff men she'll ever be around.  Yeah.  Mortuary school.  Yeah.  Are you drinking the...  You know what?  I was like...  Get your mom into it?  Yeah.  No, it's just something to you rather than...  I didn't really need an answer to that. 
[01:07:30]  No.  Yeah.  Well, whatever.  I guess I'm a little...  Raise your hand if you hate this woman.  I want to know more, but I just...  Count one, two, three...  The sadness.  She's not digging deep.  Yeah, yeah.  She's not really exposing this inner sadness.  So you're mad that men can't tame you, so...  Oh, we got a guy that wants to tame her on the line.  Let's say hi to Bob in Jersey.  Bob, you're on with Tara, who needs some taming.  What's up?  Yeah, it sounds like she does.  Do you guys remember the Bob and Angela limo ride?  The what? 
[01:08:00]  The Bob and Angela limo ride?  The Bob and...  Does that...  It goes back about 10 years when you guys were on that other station.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  What did he say?  That's me.  Yeah, I went...  I left for the ride with Angela and took care of her.  I hope you didn't believe it.  Oh, okay.  I remember you.  Sure.  Yeah, yeah.  I can take care of this one, too.  She sounds like a decent pig.  Hey, Tara, are you a decent pig?  Well, it's no relative.  It depends on what your definition is. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, my God.  I couldn't understand.  Yeah, this one...  Thank you, Bob.  Yeah, I have a...  I'm very good at what I do, but I don't...  I just...  Well, what do you do?  What are you very good at?  Yeah, what are you good at?  What do you do?  He said, I'm very good at what I do.  All right, what do you do?  Listen to this nonsense answer.  Tara.  Well, what...  What?  I'm very good at what I do.  What do you do?  Oh, my God.  I'm so nervous.  That's why.  I'm sorry.  No, when I just... 
[01:09:00]  When I am with...  I am freaking awesome at sex.  I love sex.  I am really good at, like...  She's good at sex, guys.  Oh, when I do do it.  Oh, okay.  Steven S. from Bayshore writes,  drunk, boring, coked up, and wants to work in a funeral home.  What a catch.  Yeah, right?  All right, listen, Tara, we don't know what to do with you, to be honest.  She's just some...  Yeah.  You're some coked out, Heineken-drinking whore from Jersey.  Horny old young broad.  That sounds so difficult. 
[01:09:30]  Sounds like you would be an easy lay, so you got that going for you.  Which is nice.  Actually, that's the thing I'm not.  All you need is some whore bait, and you're ready to go with this one.  Yeah, no, that's the part of not an easy lay.  Really?  Like caffeine.  Yeah, yeah.  You are easy.  Just a little coke, and you go.  That's pretty much the...  I watch all the...  No, that's what coke...  That's why they call them coke whores.  Do people even exist like this? 
[01:10:00]  Coke whores?  I thought they stopped after the mommas and the papas was done.  Hell no.  Like, that's some 70s.  It's alive and well, man.  What are you, Diane Keaton?  Yeah, they are.  They're already not.  You looking for Mr. Goodbar?  It's called whore bait.  You just kind of...  You know, you just show your whore bait, and you're ready to go.  Yeah, I get it when I want to.  If I want to, on my own accord, and I never, ever, ever have...  So what is your problem right now, Diane?  Say it a little bit.  We don't even know why you're calling the show.  Tara, Jared wants...  Jared wants...  Jared wants... 
[01:10:30]  Jared wants to...  Jared wants to...  Jared wants to...  Jared wants to know...  Jared wants to know...  Do you take it...  Jared wants to know...  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!  Jared wants to know if you take it in the fart box.  Hmm.  Oh, my God.  Fair enough question.  Fair enough.  Oh, my God.  Fair enough, yeah.  You do?  Oh, you do?  No, no, I have for a boyfriend, but not on a...  Special occasions.  Yeah. 
[01:11:00]  And for some of that good Coke.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a special place.  Yeah, it's very special on her.  Yeah, how did that become the special place?  Is it special?  Why is that special?  Well, I'll give that up for my boyfriend.  You can...  How is that a treat for anyone?  Everybody can have where the babies come out, but no one can have where that other thing  comes from.  Yeah, I'm saving that for marriage.  That's the special place, you know?  Why is that special?  Where the children...  Where life begins, that's...  That's not the special... 
[01:11:30]  That's not the special place anymore.  But the tubing, that one is...  Oh, this is where only wonderful people can...  You make a great point.  Yeah.  What the hell is that about?  I'm saving it for marriage.  That's the special place?  I'm saving it for that special someone.  Gee, thanks.  Dumpster.  It's my special place.  Right.  Gee, thanks.  That makes no sense.  That's not a special place.  That's a...  That's a very drunk night. 
[01:12:00]  That's what that is.  There's nothing special about it.  Only special ones can get this.  I don't need...  I was waiting for the...  I got a dirty side in.  I never had done it in a long time, ever.  And then I just...  Forget that.  Why would I hurt myself?  Is this Amy Winehouse?  You're a mess.  You are a frigging mess, Tara.  And if you're admitting to a few Heinekens and Coke, that means there's some other things  you're doing that you're not going to admit to. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  No, like what?  Ask me.  What would you want to know?  Gang Bangs.  The H.  What?  No, no, no.  I'm taking a little of the H.  Heroin juice.  Yeah.  A little heroin juice.  Just mixes it in a coffee.  And special places.  Now, I experiment with a lot of stuff.  Listen to this babbling ass.  And there's parts of things that like...  Teeth grinding.  Ever.  Tongue is swollen.  Yeah.  How many guys at once?  Yeah.  I never...  No H.  I bet you two.  How many guys at once?  Three.  I never did more than one. 
[01:13:00]  I've had a girl in them.  And they stole a girl from her boyfriend.  Yeah.  Just because I was...  It was fun, but...  You must be a hell of a catch.  Yeah.  All right.  So, I don't really know why you called us today.  I put you a Sybil Shepard mixed with...  Well, you don't want...  Yeah, I just...  Okay.  The secretary for moonlight.  All right, Tyra, I'll do this for you.  What's that?  When you have a point, you call us back.  Yeah.  And we're going to listen to what you have to say.  So, you go take...  All right.  You go take the next five or ten minutes and try to figure out, like, a thought. 
[01:13:30]  Can she take a cell phone picture and send it in?  Yeah.  Send us a picture of yourself, too.  Or do you have a MySpace or a Facebook?  What do you got?  I don't have any of those.  I don't post anything online ever because I don't trust...  I would never do that to myself.  Oh, you don't trust MySpace or Facebook, but you'll trust some local drug dealer?  Yeah, no.  No, I have...  All right.  No way.  All right, Tyra, here's your...  Yeah, no, MySpace. 
[01:14:00]  Where would I...  I'd send you guys a picture, but I don't...  Tyra, here's the deal.  You spend the next five or ten minutes trying to come up with a point, and you call us back,  okay?  Yeah.  I will promise you that.  All right.  All right.  All right.  We're going to hear from Tyra after the break.  There she goes.  For Tyra, we're going to do a little of this from Roland.  After the break, we got I Miss Audio.  But, Tyra, if you're still listening, this is for you.  Roland, sing in rehab.  They try to take me to go to rehab.  I said, no, no, no.  Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you won't know, no, no. 
[01:14:30]  I got the time.  If my daddy thinks I'm fine.  He's trying to take me to go to rehab.  I won't go, go, go.  I'd rather be at home with Ray.  I ain't got 70 days. 
[01:15:00]  Because there's nothing, nothing you can teach me that I can learn from Mr. Hathaway.  Is that him?  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony and Patrice O'Neal this morning.  Patrice is trying to, he's showing me, he's pointing to the Fox News traffic girl going, 
[01:15:30]  hey, Anthony, what do you think?  Like, I'm the traffic girl guy.  That's my new gig.  But I don't think, I don't think Patrice understands Whitey, though.  The one you're pointing out doesn't compare to Jill Nicolini.  Not even in the same league.  Of course not.  That's like a Fox traffic girl.  Why?  That's like comparing the NBA to the WNBA.  Yeah.  That girl's not even in the same league as Jill Nicolini.  I got to look at it again. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  877-212-ON-A, speaking of the WNBA, a milestone happened.  I think it was over the weekend.  But Candice Parker, ready for this, Patrice?  Candice Parker became the second woman.  Uh-oh, let me take a guess.  Wait.  In WNBA history to miss her monthly during the season.  There you go.  There's your answer.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go. 
[01:16:30]  Now I'm not going to tell the people.  Oh, we know what it is.  That answer's much better.  It's got to be.  Second woman in WNBA history to dunk.  That must have been a foul-looking one.  You know, it was barely.  Was it barely?  Yeah.  It wasn't like a LeBron James or a Michael Jordan dunk.  You know, it was just barely over the top.  It was that 75-step travel girl dunk.  But they didn't call it because she's a girl and she dunked.  Yeah.  They want to make a big thing. 
[01:17:00]  You know who Candice Parker is, by the way.  I have to say this correctly.  She was the lead player in the last I Miss Controversy, but she was the one he called  the pretty one.  She's one of the Rutgers girls?  No.  She's the girl.  Remember, the reason he called the Rutgers girls what he called them is because he called  the...  It was like, boy, it was like the ugly ones versus the pretty ones.  Right, right.  She was the pretty one.  She was the prettiest one on the pretty team.  Oh, on Tennessee.  On Tennessee.  It was Tennessee, right?  Yeah, she was the best player for them. 
[01:17:30]  All right.  I gotcha.  Very, very good.  So she...  Oh, I didn't even know.  See?  I don't know anything about the WNBA.  Very good.  She's a cutie.  Look at her.  She's beautiful.  No.  If you get past the fact that she's 6'8".  She is huge.  What?  How tall is she?  Seriously.  6'4".  6'4".  Well...  Imagine walking in somewhere with her.  She's beautiful as long as she sits down the entire time. 
[01:18:00]  I was at a party a couple of years with a bunch of WNBA girls and Jennifer...  What's her name from Connecticut?  She was really good, but I said, you know, I'm a big fan.  I really think you can play.  She's like, thanks, buddy.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Good looking out.  No lie.  Just good.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good looking, dude.  That's a guy with long hair.  You don't think she's pretty?  No.  You don't think she's pretty?  No.  I think she's a lovely guy.  Go like this.  Too manly looking.  Squint a little and then put your hand over the rest of the body. 
[01:18:30]  Just look from the chin up.  From the chin up.  Let me see.  I don't know.  She's got a little bit in her.  It's kind of like a guy.  She's a cutie to me.  You like that?  Wait a minute.  But if you go all the way up to her eyes, then she's beautiful.  She's a cutie, man.  All right, look.  Go up to her.  There's nothing manly about her.  Go up to her eyes and she's beautiful.  The nose, she's still beautiful.  It's the chin.  Something not manly.  Something boyish looking about her. 
[01:19:00]  Well, she has to play basketball.  I mean, I think.  There you go.  Zoom in.  Come on, E-Rock.  Now, can we see her face?  I mean, a woman doing manly things.  See, look at that.  That's not a cutie pie?  That looks like a junior high school boy.  Oh, will you stop?  Yes.  Candice is a cutie.  No, she's beautiful, man, when you see just her face.  Absolutely.  She's a cutie.  I want to see one girl in the WNBA that just has massive boobies somehow.  Really?  Somehow fell through the cracks and those big boobies didn't get in the way. 
[01:19:30]  See her slow-mo dunk.  Slow motion just dribbling up the court with those big boobies.  Oh, wow.  Is that her?  Yeah.  Zoom in.  Zoom in.  You're not well in.  Come on, Mr. Rock.  Come on.  You're just a racist to your bones.  I'm a racist to me.  How can you not think she's a cutie?  Look at this little thing.  Oh, wow.  A little bit of five o'clock shadow under the arms. 
[01:20:00]  Got a little European thing going.  You know, yeah.  You get her out of those WNBA clothes, she's got something going on in it.  That's six foot four of glory right there.  Six foot four of lusciousness.  You're a racist.  I am into white chicks.  You're a racist.  That's just it.  But I think that's partly gay.  What?  You now are insane.  There's a gay tinge to somebody who doesn't like all women.  No.  I think it is.  I'm a xenophobe.  Nobody racist. 
[01:20:30]  There's no racism that goes that high.  Like Hitler would have been like, well, she's cutie pie.  She's from Africa.  But I'll take it.  You know what I mean?  Like a dude, dude.  You are attacking my masculinity based on my racism?  Slightly gay.  Do you find any black women hot?  No, he's a racist.  But that girl, she's definitely hot, man.  And she's more white than black, by the way.  That's what I'm saying.  Not even, Anthony's so.  No, that's not true.  Because I probably.  Name one black girl you find hot.  Back in the day, I probably would have had sex with. 
[01:21:00]  What's her name?  Stupid.  Back in the day.  What, before you joined her?  Francine.  Nobody has to say stupid.  Francine.  Oh, yeah.  Like stupid Francine.  You're right.  Francine is.  I probably would have had sex with her.  You're talking about a boy?  Francine is built like a boy.  Nah, Francine is.  I'm just saying.  She's black.  Cut me some slack, Jack.  I can't do that.  You're not allowed.  You're not allowed to go.  You know what you're not allowed to do?  What?  You're not allowed to go.  Hey, that black girl.  Like, you're supposed to.  Just any hot looking black girl?  Dude sleep with anything.  No.  Yes, man. 
[01:21:30]  That's, no.  I don't find certain girls aren't my type.  What, to sleep with?  I'm not saying to marry.  No, I need to be.  No guy has a type that he's sleeping with.  Dude, you don't get physically attracted.  Sex isn't better when you have a visual stimulus.  You don't like looking at a girl and going.  A hot girl is a hot girl.  Not in my book.  On every level.  I agree.  I agree with Patrice.  No, there are certain girls.  Now, there's hotness. 
[01:22:00]  There's order of hotness.  Like, I would put Latin women one, black women two.  Wow.  Your list is upside down of mine.  But, see, Patrice is as racist as you are.  You guys are different colors.  Yeah.  But he would still sleep with a white girl.  That's what I'm saying.  I look at a white girl.  A white girl.  But you wouldn't sleep with a black girl, though.  I wouldn't look at a hot black girl and go.  I might.  It would have to be the perfect.  Look at her.  She's white.  It would have to be the perfect black girl that has something else in her a little bit. 
[01:22:30]  She looks like a zombie.  It would have to be like, you know, mix.  Really?  A mulatta.  Something like that.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Your racism is almost unprecedented.  Thank you.  It's unprecedented racism.  Really black women do scare me.  What do you mean really black?  Like, attitude?  Well, no.  That's intimidating.  Just imagine that.  You best do this right, white boy.  And you're sitting there just going, oh, no.  You're packing monsters. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, there she goes.  You're afraid of the black woman's prowess in the South?  Yeah.  And they don't have a special place.  They're crazy.  Look at this white girl here.  Heigl.  How can I say I wouldn't?  But that's different.  How can I say I wouldn't?  How is that different?  You're not as racist as me.  That, I'm as racist.  Like, white women bug me, but you go, it has nothing to do with sleeping with them.  No, there's certain girls I find attractive.  I need to have a type.  I need to be visually stimulated. 
[01:23:30]  An attractive girl is an attractive girl.  I can't just, I might as well just stay home with some Vaseline.  If you're not going to be visually stimulated by a woman's body and her laying down in a  bed or something.  I'm having trouble with this.  Hold on.  I'm having trouble with this.  You're not stimulated by, like, a cafe latte woman?  Maybe.  It would have to be, like I said, the right one.  I'm not just going to grab any sister and throw her in the bed and think she's hot.  But you don't find them hot whatsoever.  I walk down the streets of New York here and you see, like, a beautiful black woman coming 
[01:24:00]  at you.  I'm dying.  You don't even have to explain.  Look, Mexicans aren't my favorite looking women.  Like a classic Mexican girl that's short, blocky build.  But if I see, but there's, like, Penelope Cruz or one of them, if you see a beautiful  whatever they are, that's a sexy woman.  What are you talking about?  Well, that's what I said.  No, you didn't.  I said that in the right circumstance.  You can't just throw any black woman at me and say, there is no circumstance.  That's not like that basketball player.  Well, I'm not, I wouldn't touch her.  You are sickening.  That's not sickening. 
[01:24:30]  I don't find her attractive.  And I, I'm, I, you're, you're pure, a pure racist.  You, so are you.  But I'll sleep with a white woman.  And that's, that's out of a racist.  And then I'll treat her like a white woman.  That's a racist power trip thing.  Yeah, exactly.  Out you go and tell the white slave master, thank you for his wife.  But other than that, tell the man, thank you.  But you got to be kidding me. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, I, I don't, I, you get, you really are.  You got to be kidding me.  You're racist goes pretty deep.  It's not, it doesn't have to do with racism.  I think it does.  There are a lot of black women out there.  Majority of Asian women I don't find attractive.  But that's not the point.  I just don't.  I understand what you're saying.  They usually, usually got flat booties.  Usually got funny looking, whatever.  They're not sexy.  That accent isn't sexy.  But I'm not saying there aren't some that are.  But if you see one, Lucy Liu, you got to take, you got to go for it. 
[01:25:30]  Right.  That's the one in a million shot, though.  Come on.  The one in a, there's seven billion of them.  There's not, Lucy Liu is just the one special case.  Stop.  You're not talking like a dude.  Wait, I'm talking like a dude.  You're not talking like a dude.  Hold on.  Pierce Mark from Wackbag, he writes, Anthony's color cut off is beige.  Where is your, where is your color cut off?  Color cut off.  Because my color cut off is black as, black as night or black as, like, Patrice's shirt 
[01:26:00]  right there.  That would be my color cut off right there.  Really?  And I don't even like that black.  Patrice's shirt.  I'm wearing a black t-shirt.  I'm not going to lie to you.  That would scare me.  But there are no black women in this country this black.  Right.  That is a special kind of tribe.  Actually, I saw them in the Bahamas.  Actually.  In the Bahamas, I saw some black women.  Not as black as this t-shirt.  I mean, literally.  That's my color cut off, though.  Like, your skin color, Patrice?  If that skin color was on a woman, I'd be all right with that.  But if the skin color was as dark as a shirt, then you've lost me.  Oh, he's got jungle fever. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, dude.  That's not jungle fever, though.  That's dude-ness.  Yeah.  Dude-ness.  Dude-ness.  No, but Anthony's sort of onto something, because when I was living in Buffalo, I went  through a stage where I was hanging out in some of the black clubs, because I really  wanted to bang a black woman.  The club.  Fetish.  And they used to laugh at me.  That's in different categories.  You had a fetish at the time?  Yeah, maybe it's more of a fetish.  But they laughed at me.  They thought, oh, look at this silly white boy trying to get some action in this place.  You can't.  You're just not allowed to say.  I like to judge my tail by the content of their character. 
[01:27:00]  Where's your color cut off?  Seriously.  My color cut off.  That's a great question.  No one says that, though, Opie.  This is...  And where's your color cut off?  Like, albino white?  I don't like...  Where would it scare you?  Those pasty white girls are not attractive, but...  Hold on, hold on.  There's a couple of pasty white girls here, but you pop them.  But I do want to say the other side of it.  What you're saying, pasty white?  Is my color cut off the other way?  Absolutely.  See?  I don't mind pasty white girls.  Nope. 
[01:27:30]  That's too far the other way from me.  I'm going to call Schindler.  What's his...  What's his number?  Anthony.  Schindler?  One is alive.  Jesus.  Is it safe?  Why don't you just...  Why don't you just drill my live tooth?  You piece of garbage.  You're awful.  No, I can't.  I am not that far gone.  What's your color cut off, though?  That's a great question.  But, like I said, I would...  You know, back in the day over at NEW, I'd have thrown Francina banging. 
[01:28:00]  Back in the day, Anthony.  So that's my color cut off?  2008, color cut off.  Like, how far...  And you're doing her a favor when you should have been.  It was not a favor.  Yeah, that's more like a favor crap.  Like, let's say you're still single.  Where's your color cut off just getting action?  Not even going out with them.  Well, you see, Tannis Parker's nearly white.  I would so...  That's easy.  That's an easy one.  A tan white woman is better than a...  He wants a white woman that tans to the level of a black woman. 
[01:28:30]  Would Halle...  Oh, yeah.  Okay, then let me grab one of them freckle-faced black girls.  They're cute, aren't they?  No.  You don't like freckle-faced?  That looks odd.  Ed, Halle Berry is...  Don't give me the Halle Berry crap.  That bitch is so old now, she don't look good anymore.  But I'm not even...  Stop it.  It's a Halle Berry.  God, I'm not saying Halle Berry!  Can white people find another hot black chick to talk about besides Halle Berry?  That's talking about her color.  That's the innate racism.  No, it's not.  She's just not...  That Halle is the one that has to be... 
[01:29:00]  That's what they got to put her up on the pedestal.  How about Naomi Campbell, would you?  Naomi Campbell?  That's getting a little...  Why'd you repeat it?  That's getting too...  Anthony's racism is starting to bother him.  Because Naomi...  I'm like, no, not Naomi Campbell.  I've never found her attractive.  How about Tyra?  Tyra?  Tyra in her day was pretty hot.  And if she didn't have to talk, she...  Yeah, right there.  So you would...  Anthony, what I meant by Halle Berry was her color.  I'm looking for your color cutoff.  Would she have to be lighter than Halle Berry?  That's all I'm saying.  Yeah, Halle Berry isn't all that light. 
[01:29:30]  She's a good reference point.  Oh, Halle Berry!  They get a lot darker than that!  Halle Berry's a darky, too!  I'm not...  No, I'm just saying she's not the antithesis of the light-skinned black woman.  Look at how light she is!  Look at this bitch!  She looks white in this picture.  His reaction is the same.  He just said Florence from the Jeffersons.  You're a disgusting racist!  I like Florida Evans.  Look, the picture we got of Halle Berry up on the screen...  Listen to me.  The picture we got up of Halle Berry on the screen, she's walking next to a white dude. 
[01:30:00]  She's barely darker than the white dude.  Oh, look at this after the pregnancy.  Look at those juicy things like...  You know, are you not well?  I'm fine.  He's...  There are just women that I don't find attractive based on certain things.  Oh, based on their race.  Some races...  A hot girl is a hot girl.  A hot girl is a hot girl.  Find me a hot Eskimo.  Find me a hot Eskimo.  I guarantee you there's a hot Eskimo.  All right?  Find a hot Eskimo.  Somewhere with a head sticking out of a blowhole. 
[01:30:30]  Not knowing she's that gorgeous.  Blubber.  That's the bit.  Find me a hot Eskimo.  Find a hot Eskimo.  Anthony might have got you there.  That's going to be a rough one.  But they're one of those...  Anthony, you walked down the streets here in Manhattan.  Yeah, it's a melting pot out there.  But you've never turned your head because a black woman walked by and you went, wow.  No.  Sure, I have.  All right looking white woman or stunning dark skinned woman.  I got to go with the white chick.  There you go.  Sorry.  Who's that?  Oh, is that...  Who is she? 
[01:31:00]  She's the daughter...  Stacey Dash.  She's 42.  She's delicious.  All right.  She's the daughter from Lethal Weapon?  The daughter from Lethal Weapon?  And they all look alike.  Yeah.  See?  No, I'm kidding.  Isn't that the one from Fresh Prince of Bel-Air?  Yeah, that's...  Wow.  I thought the daughter from Lethal Weapon was hot.  She was four.  No!  Hey, someone had a great line of instant feedback.  Their color cutoff was...  I can't give you credit because it's long gone.  Yeah, but they said plumb.  Plumb?  Their color cutoff.  This is bothering me. 
[01:31:30]  All right, Zonit.  Dudes just...  Like...  Not dudes.  That doesn't have to do with a dude thing.  Do you watch black porn at all?  No.  It disturbs me.  Not...  Black on black is fine.  Black on black porn is...  Black on black porn is fine.  The slavery revenge box.  I don't like that whole...  Yeah, yeah.  That's a little much.  I don't know the word for you.  All right, hold on.  We got Malik.  Malik from Asbury Park.  We talk to Malik a lot.  Yeah, Malik, what's up? 
[01:32:00]  What's up, fellas?  What's up, Patrice?  What's up?  What's up, man?  I kind of...  I kind of...  I feel what you're saying, Pete.  Mm-hmm.  I kind of feel what Anthony's saying, too, because I don't think Jill Nicolini are that  sweet.  I think Angela Bassett better looking than Jill Nicolini.  Angela Bassett?  Get out of here.  Angela Bassett is a sexy woman, man.  No.  But see, the point is...  Angela Bassett is not a sexy woman.  Put up Angela Bassett.  The point is that you would still...  Dudes do this.  Mm-hmm.  Like me and my friend of mine, Will, we talk about that. 
[01:32:30]  He goes, how about this one here?  I go, eh.  And he goes, would you hit it?  And then I go, that's not the point.  See, Patrice...  That's not the point.  You're hitting anything.  That's not true.  Angela Bassett stinks.  Look at Angela Bassett.  You know what that would look like?  She stinks.  She takes that top off.  She stinks.  She's just two white guys.  No.  Don't put me in his category.  I'm in my own category.  She doesn't stink.  She takes that top off, and they are sinking down to her goddamn belly button.  Well, but you wouldn't...  You would say no to that? 
[01:33:00]  To Angela Bassett?  I'm not talking about dating her and loving her.  Not even a second.  Go back to that picture.  She's got the saggy, small boob disease.  I wouldn't be able to even...  Saggy, small boob disease.  I wouldn't be able to even want to undress her.  You're not well.  No way.  Tracy Bingham.  What?  Tracy Bingham.  Who's that?  That's a black girl for you.  Who's she?  Tracy Bingham.  Laura London.  Show me.  I need pictures.  I don't know names.  You're not going to convince Anthony, because he has to go to Thanksgiving with his family. 
[01:33:30]  This is what this is about.  Who are you kidding?  At least he admits he's...  Heard you on the radio.  Didn't we teach you well?  At least he is.  What's wrong with you?  Where is she?  Right here.  Hey, what about Laura London?  Tracy Bingham.  You like that.  She's from Baywatch.  She's a white acceptable black girl.  I'm looking at that.  Her face is a little weird.  As long as she doesn't talk.  Another one of those broads, as long as she doesn't talk, because she's got that...  I need a full...  Give me a full shot there, Iraq.  If you got a better shot.  A little full body, maybe, making a different face. 
[01:34:00]  There you go.  She's buxom.  There you go.  Why wouldn't you?  She's a buxom broad.  Why wouldn't you if you were single?  Seriously, yeah.  Come on.  That's what I'm saying.  What's wrong with you?  I didn't say...  That's a metrosexual.  I wouldn't.  No!  You're turning this into gayness.  He's a...  No, a metro...  I don't want to say you're gay, because you're not gay.  They say metrosexual is not a gay thing.  You're...  You just...  You're...  Something...  I don't know what's wrong with you.  There's nothing wrong with me.  You're the type of guy that goes, ew.  Ew.  Like... 
[01:34:30]  What?  Like, ew.  Only a guy that would go, ew, could possibly go, I don't sleep with certain races.  I wouldn't...  Not, I don't sleep with certain races.  Certain...  Now, who's that?  Alicia Keys.  Yeah, but Alicia Keys has a big butt.  Alicia Keys has a weird body, but...  Oh, excuse me?  This is the problem we're having.  She's got a big butt.  She talks like a sister.  No black guy says that as an insult.  Like, that's where it is.  We just really on that.  Because I don't like that skinny...  I think models are gross. 
[01:35:00]  Like, model bodies make us...  They sicken me.  Yeah.  Tall, skinny, white girls.  See?  That's...  I think they look like boys.  That's where black guys and white guys definitely think differently, man.  Giselle Bunchen.  No, I've been with you.  See, that's crazy.  Patrice, I've been with you.  You're talking crazy now.  I'm not talking crazy.  I would...  Talking crazy.  Put it this way.  Has nothing to do with me sleeping with her, but looking at her, I go, ehhh.  I don't go, ooh.  I go, ooh, it's Stacey Dash, but ehhh. 
[01:35:30]  Giselle Bunchen, ehhh.  There's hotter models.  What name on that you thought was hot?  Cindy Crawford, all those white girls that are supposed to be beautiful.  Well, back in the day, Cindy Crawford, yes.  I would, but bleh.  I don't know their names.  There's a Victoria's Secret model right now that's ridiculous.  The one with the dark hair and the big stunning blue eyes and stuff?  Yes, whatever her name is.  Yeah, whatever her name is.  I don't know her name, though.  She's way better looking than Giselle.  She's the one they feature all the time in the commercials. 
[01:36:00]  She's the one they really focus on a lot more.  Yeah, she is ridiculous.  White guys, black guys with the ass.  Who is this girl you're talking about?  We're going to get a picture, but let me make my point.  The white guy, black guy looking at the ass thing, they're completely two different things.  Like, for you to say Alicia Keys is too much booty.  Her booty is way too big.  It's sacrilegious.  Anywhere above 119th Street, you can't say that.  Patrice, I'm not saying I'm right, but, you know, you guys definitely think differently  when it comes to that stuff.  Oh, because you like the big booty.  That big booty scares the white guy. 
[01:36:30]  I think white guys think of big booties as it has nothing to do with the actual insertions.  And, Patrice, I'm with you.  Hold on.  I don't know what you would call it, but the actual places where things go has nothing  to do with the size of the butt cheek.  Patrice, that's fine, but we're not.  Little baby butt cheeks?  For the most part, white guys don't like a flat ass either.  We want to.  You do.  No, we want a shapely ass.  We just don't want a huge.  If you don't think these models are sexy, you want a flat ass.  No, no, they got nice little butts.  Say it again.  They got nice little butts. 
[01:37:00]  There you go.  Good job.  I've seen these women that walk around, black women with giant asses that's a shelf on the  back, and I see black guys go, God damn, that's hot.  Oh, God damn, look at that ass.  And I'm looking going, I'm disgusted.  You look at two lima beans and go, mmm, she's hot.  Yeah, that's where we're not going to.  We're never going to agree on that point.  We're going to have to agree to disagree.  Yeah, I understand that.  Because those fat asses disgust me.  You can't.  An ass is not sexy if you can hold it the same way you check to see if bread's done. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  If you go, okay, this, almost, almost.  I don't want an ass that looks like she's been sitting in a gravel driveway and got up  and wiped it off.  That's what, all that cellulite and. . .  It's not.  Like, you're racist and then maybe you make things up.  No, these fat asses get the puckers in them.  Yeah, puck bar.  You don't want some puckered. . .  What is. . .  That's not. . .  All right, who's that?  That's a nice ass.  That's Danny's ass.  Oh, my God.  Oh, mine is. . .  Mine can't rival that.  That's actually a chick.  I don't know where she came from, but her name is Kira Augustina. 
[01:38:00]  She's not white.  I don't know what she is, but she's the most perfectest thing I've ever seen.  And show a picture of her.  I'm sure Anthony wouldn't sleep with her because she's a little too dark.  Come on.  I got to see what she looks like.  I'm visually stimulated.  And look, we said that's a nice ass, Patrice, and that wasn't a skinny little flat ass.  I'm very visually. . .  He didn't say it was nice.  I need visual.  I need an attractive visual stimulation.  See, now that you know she's white, you're going to go, okay,  that was a nice ass.  No, this girl here? 
[01:38:30]  That's the same girl, right?  The girls that Booty was attached to.  Mm-hmm.  Dude, just. . .  See, Ann wasn't ready to say that was a nice ass until he knew it was attached to a white woman.  No.  Yes, you said you needed to. . .  Of course I thought it was a nice ass.  But I wanted to see what she looked like.  It's not unacceptable as a racist.  It's unacceptable as a dude.  I have to transcend. . .  You can. . .  Listen, you can be like your bleep button.  You can. . .  You can. . .  You can go. . .  I would. . .  I don't. . .  You know, I don't find . . . 
[01:39:00]  attractive, but I'd sleep with . . .  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Let's go to Liz in Jersey.  Wow, that's interesting.  Liz, how are you?  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Hey.  Anthony likes women that he can make blush.  There you go.  That's his color cut off.  That's my color cut off.  If they can't blush.  Then no way, right?  All right, thank you.  That's awful.  We have to take a break.  Well, at least, thank God, you're not saying that exactly.  You're a reasonable white guy.  You're just an unreasonable racist. 
[01:39:30]  No.  No.  I find certain things attractive, and certain things I don't find attractive.  And I need to look at something.  I don't mind you being racist.  It's just like, this is doom code.  You seem to be a guy that could jump on a girl, and you don't need to look at the girl  and be visually excited by what you say.  Any beautiful girl is a beautiful girl.  No, I need my cut off point of being visually stimulated is different.  He's not acknowledging what I'm saying. 
[01:40:00]  Any beautiful girl is a beautiful girl, no matter what race she is.  But your window of beauty is a lot bigger than mine is.  All right, when you sleep with this girl right here, what's her name?  Who is she?  She's beautiful.  That girl is beautiful.  That's Megan Good.  Nice see-through black top she's got on.  Delicious little Megan Good.  Where'd she come from?  What do you mean?  Stop the Yard.  Ethiopia.  Stop the Yard.  The chick from Stop the Yard.  No, she's very cute.  When you have sex with her.  Be honest.  Yeah, yeah.  I'd throw her a banging. 
[01:40:30]  As a favor to her?  Don't put conditions on this.  Here you go, nigglet.  Take some of this master's sweet something out of your mind.  Today's your lucky day, sweetie.  Lucky you, doggy.  I did not say that.  And then you can clean my house right afterwards.  Pleasure for me.  I heard you guys like frying chicken.  Oh, my God.  Don't be in my kitchen frying chicken.  Listen to this idiot.  You guys are pussies.  I'm pretty much on Patrice's side, you ass. 
[01:41:00]  Thank you, whoever wrote that, because it doesn't sound right.  No, I'm on your side.  You're there, except for you still got white guy disease, but you're there as a dude.  I would even have sex with a girl as black as your t-shirt for the story.  He's a dude.  For the story.  See, I'll take your racism.  But I would.  It's just dude code.  You don't say yuck to a race in terms of having sex. 
[01:41:30]  I wasn't.  I looked at that one girl there.  She looks cute.  Not convincing.  There's something going on in your head, Ant.  No, it's just.  You've got some major filters in you.  You're scared to admit.  Christina Miljard.  I find certain types of girls more attractive than others.  Some I don't find attractive at all.  I need to look at something and be visually stimulated by it.  Yeah, some of these black girls will do that.  Some? 
[01:42:00]  All right, I'll give you some.  Look at this little delicious thing.  You doing her a big favor?  I'll throw her a ball.  Hey, I'll throw her some of this aged salami.  They need to play along at home.  It's Christina Miljard.  Okay, we've got to take a break.  And it's too bad because this break we wanted to talk about the special place because I really found that funny.  Oh, the special place.  When women say they're saving their special place for marriage.  Yeah.  And, man, we came to the realization, what the F is really special about that? 
[01:42:30]  About it.  That should be what you give up first.  Yeah.  It's like, no, children may come out of here one day.  Let me not let them.  No, the special place is.  Special places, yeah.  That should be the tester.  It's the dump.  Where they give that up to test you.  To see what you're all about.  I don't need this to be special.  Right.  If you're going to spend a half hour afterwards in the bathroom cleaning up and puking, it's not that special. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, this is special.  You know what kills me about you?  I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.  Hope you and Anthony.  Go, Patricia.  He just upgraded to JN.  Like, how dare you?  Yeah.  He just upgraded to that.  All right, I've got a question for Anthony.  This is going to be a tough one.  This is going to be a tough one, knowing how racist you really are.  If you found out, if you found out that Jill Nicolini has a relative, maybe a few generations ago, a more, and it is, found out that she has a little bit of the black in her, now what happens? 
[01:43:30]  Jesus.  I know that's a tough question.  A scene from True Romance.  Of course I wouldn't do it.  What am I going to do?  A family tree, and you go up a few branches to the end of the branch, and there it is.  Give me one of those Chesterfields. 
[01:44:00]  Hey, uh, Jill.  No.  You'll find out there's a little something something.  No, I, uh...  I want to see how racist...  That's the new bit.  How racist is...  Nothing would change.  As Anthony kills her and then goes, let me wipe some of this egg off my face.  Nothing would change.  At this point, we're not questioning that you're racist.  Now we need to know how racist you are.  Wow.  I didn't think this was racism.  This is what I find attractive, but I don't. 
[01:44:30]  No.  No.  This is racism.  Yes, it is.  Because we got dude code, and then we have racism.  I find white girls attractive.  That's...  I didn't argue that.  More so than any other race.  All right.  That has nothing to do with me.  That is just the way I am.  But have you ever had a moment with a black guy?  Let me explain before you jump on me.  Oh, with a black guy?  Let me explain before you throw me under the bus.  Like, Patrice and I have had that moment.  We're on the sidewalk, and some hot thing is walking down the street, and we kind of give 
[01:45:00]  each other a look like, who gives a crap?  She's black.  Look at that.  Look at that.  And I go, yeah.  And there's an acknowledgement of like, wow.  I'm never going to say I haven't walked in New York City and not seen an attractive  black girl.  That's insane.  Of course I have.  I've commented on it.  So what's the problem?  But I'm just not going to jump on every single one just because she's got sex organs.  Why not?  Because I need... 
[01:45:30]  Like, look at this long-in-a-toothed Brooke Shields.  Uh-huh.  I'd still...  You still have to...  She's a...  You know, she's not...  Well, you'd have to do that just for the hell of it.  But immediately you go Halle Berry old, but Brooke Shields is, you know...  All right, listen.  I'm not sitting here saying Brooke Shields is gorgeous.  Anthony, the Victoria's Secret model, thank you, Meatball from Queens, is Adriana Lima.  Yeah.  Let's see her.  And Anthony, I got to...  Really fast.  Give me a moment here.  I'm sick of the haters to this effing radio show. 
[01:46:00]  If you don't like this show, then go find something else to listen to.  Circle Mouth from Philly.  Opie, I love you guys, but I can't believe how cheap you are.  You make the fans in studio throw cash at Tibby Tom when you are a multi-millionaire.  Tibby Tom makes you some of that money, and that's how you treat him.  Buy him food for the week.  Let me tell you something, Circle Mouth.  I threw him a few bucks, like $5, in studio as a bit.  I'm going to tear down a wall.  After the effing show in the hallway as he's waiting by the elevator, I handed him...  You gave him another dollar, so just shut up.  No, I actually handed him $100, but I don't need to do it on the effing show, you dick. 
[01:46:30]  Just do that.  You probably lost it.  You dick.  Thought it was a 10.  Once you understand...  That was one bottle of wine with it.  Understand what the radio show is all about, and understand maybe we are nice guys and  doing the right thing behind the scenes, you jerk.  Hey, yeah.  Enough with the effing haters in the show.  Was he in the studio?  Swast these effers.  Was he in the studio?  What?  Was he a guest in the studio that day, if he was able to...  He's pissed, because I...  I know, no, I know, but how did he...  There was close to 100 people checking out Friday's show, and I'm like, this is a great 
[01:47:00]  opportunity for Tom to make some money.  He's giving us great radio, so I go, guys, if you want to throw money at Tom, by all  means, yes.  And then after the show, I did what was the right thing, so shut your effing mouth.  You don't know everything that goes on with the damn radio show.  I'm not going to sit here and take I'm cheap anymore.  For the show, yes.  I'll fool around and go, here, Tom, here's a couple bucks.  I'm in a mood today.  Sorry. 
[01:47:30]  Where were we?  We were looking at that girl.  Oh, from Victoria's Secret.  Yes.  Victoria's Secret.  Look at this.  Look at this.  Yeah.  See, Patrice, that is insanity.  First of all, let me say something to you.  Okay.  My dude code, you don't need to say that to me.  I understand, but that girl is, you know, the pressure.  Like, I would just, if I had sex with her, I would just treat her so deliciously awful 
[01:48:00]  because I know that her, she would regain consciousness after she lost her mind that she  would even sleep with me.  But that, this girl is on another level of discussion.  Like, that's, but if, if there was a Chinese version or a black version of that, you would  be going, hmm, I don't know.  That's the difference.  She's gorgeous.  But you, you look at her race and go, oh, I don't know.  A black that, a white that, a anything.  It would all depend. 
[01:48:30]  That is gorgeous.  It all depends on what they look like.  Patrice, get me a black that.  Find a black that.  Christina Millian's a black that.  I don't think she's a black that.  What?  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  That just bothers me.  We're going to move on for a second here.  All right.  Because Imus has explained himself.  Oh, he did.  From gorgeous women to wrinkle up Imus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Imus has done a lot of trouble today.  I had sex with her.  I'm sorry I did that. 
[01:49:00]  This is what Imus said yesterday.  Defensive back Adam Pacman Jones.  Recently signed by the Cowboys.  Here's a guy suspended all of 2007 following a shooting at a Vegas nightclub.  What stuff happens?  You're in a nightclub, for God's sake.  What do you think is going to happen at a nightclub?  People are drinking and doing drugs.  Yeah.  There are women there and people have guns.  So, go ahead.  Well, he's also, he's been arrested six times since being drafted by Tennessee in 2005. 
[01:49:30]  What color is he?  He's African American.  Oh, well, there you go.  Now we know.  Well.  Oh, well, there you go.  Well, there you go.  Now we know.  Now we know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, this is how he explained it this morning.  I guess Reverend Al was on Fox.  What was he saying?  Oh, boy.  What was that dope saying?  Is he already mouthing off?  Does he still have the black co-host?  He's got two.  Imus?  Two, right?  Yeah. 
[01:50:00]  He's got two.  Oh, he's loaded it up.  Certainly.  He needs that now.  He really does.  Yes, Danny.  Yeah, he still has actually Kareth Foster.  Right.  But doesn't he, but don't they kind of, are they doing their quick, like, you know, the  black job at why he hired him just to go.  Right.  So he can say stuff like that.  To go, Don, now.  Well, yeah.  That's exactly why he hired him.  But they didn't go, Don.  Oh, Lord have mercy.  No kidding.  Who's that? 
[01:50:30]  Is that Adriana again?  Oh, my God.  Holy crap.  Oh, look at that.  Ooh.  See, I'm not in a bad mood anymore.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Just spend the next 15 minutes, like, getting images of Adriana Lima.  Are you shaking your face?  No.  No, I'm going like, oh, my God.  No, I'm shaking.  I'm shaking my head.  No, then you can absolutely call me gay.  Here's a dude code here.  Ready?  Yeah.  I would pillow smother my girl for that. 
[01:51:00]  You would just, like.  I would.  You would risk everything for that.  That girl stood at the door.  I would pillow.  All right.  While she's kicking and screaming.  All right.  Pillow smother my girl for pizza.  Patrice, let me see how far you would go.  Would you take her to a homie barbecue?  A what barbecue?  What?  I would wrap her, and I would take her.  First, I would take her to the museum and tell them to put some type of glass on her  so I can wheel her around as an exhibit. 
[01:51:30]  Matter of fact, I'll have them draw.  Let me tell you what I'll do.  I would have them draw the stuff where they put the different cuts of steak on a cow  and they show a picture of a cow.  I would have them write different words on her body, explain what they are.  My girl's probably listening now.  I will kill you.  I'll smother you to death for that chick right there.  And bring her to the homie barbecue.  Cold blood.  Where the guys would be like, look, man. 
[01:52:00]  With two pistols.  You're not keeping it real, Patrice.  No, no, no, no.  Would they say that?  No, no, no.  Not for her.  Not for her.  That's why I asked that question.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  It's all right that you're banging these girls, but you don't bring them around the  hood.  They would literally say to me, they would say to her, what are you doing with him?  Like, they'd kill me for her.  Right.  Okay.  That's warlike.  There's been wars over girls like that.  Yeah.  I can guarantee it.  Just touch that.  Troy.  Troy.  Yeah, exactly.  That is Troy.  That's a Trojan war looking. 
[01:52:30]  That's worth sending a crap load of ships over to another country and invading them.  Would you risk your relationship for that?  Yeah.  Would you shoot Jill with a silencer for that?  With a silencer.  Would you shoot her with a silencer?  Oh, my God.  I love the museum angle.  Get a glass. 
[01:53:00]  As I roll her in on a trolley.  That's an exhibit.  That girl is ridiculous.  Tremendous.  All right, listen.  So, uh, Imus is explaining his faux pas today.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We'll get back to Adriana Lima.  No problem.  Yeah, just the randomly popped pictures up of her, I guess.  Oh, jeez.  The whole show stopped, too.  Oh, I know.  Everybody's like, oh, man.  You know what?  Social commentary.  What?  That's what it was.  It's the show.  Unbelievable.  All right.  Imus explaining his, uh, his, uh... 
[01:53:30]  I'm sorry.  I did that.  His misstep.  No, no, no.  Warren and I were talking yesterday about Pac-Man Jones being a wrestler.  He was arrested six times, and which I think was just, you know, it was obviously the picking  on him.  So, so I asked Warner what...  But see, he didn't make it obvious.  Like, obvious that they're picking on him.  What's obvious about that?  Hmm.  Right?  That's what I'm...  He didn't explain himself yesterday.  No.  So, so I asked Warner what color he was.  Well, obviously, I already knew what color he was. 
[01:54:00]  That's what the point was.  In order to make a sarcastic point, I asked Warner what color he was.  Warner tells me.  I said, well, there you go.  That's the point.  Yeah.  What people should be outraged about is that they arrest blacks for no reason.  Oh, God.  I miss him.  Jeez.  No reason.  What did he do?  He, he, isn't he up on, like, legitimate charges?  Ah, jeez, man.  Isn't Pac-Man Jones a problem?  Yeah.  Pac-Man Jones is...  Isn't, isn't he a problem? 
[01:54:30]  What I was saying is...  He's a, he, he, you know, Pac-Man Jones...  I mean, that, that whole strip club thing was insane like that.  Yeah.  Some, a bouncer ended up paralyzed and he just, Pac-Man ends up...  But, again, it's that thing in this country where supposedly you're alleged.  He's, it's alleged.  Right.  He's never gone to jail for any of it.  He's not doing time.  He's been found not guilty for these things and, but still, you kind of, you know.  I love the fact that if, if what I miss the saying is true, is he was trying to kiss some 
[01:55:00]  black ass right there.  That's what I hear.  And it's biting him and, and he's being accused of being racist.  That's what I hear.  He's trying to, yeah.  I'm just saying, you know, they put too many black people in jail.  That's what I'm saying.  I, I'd let them all out.  I'd, I'd turn the keys and, and just, uh, you know, let every, uh, black person that's 
[01:55:30]  in jail, I'll let them out.  That's what I'm trying to say.  Why didn't they understand that?  Imus, would you bang a black girl?  Uh, what does she look like?  What color is she?  I'm in Anthony's camp on this one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'd, uh, no, I'd have sex with a black, uh, girl.  Of course.  I'm going to be, um, divorcing my wife and marrying a black girl now.  Because it seems that's what I have to do to keep out of trouble.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jerk. 
[01:56:00]  Uh, the rap sheet on Pac-Man.  July 13th, 2005, arrested and charged with assault and felony vandalism after a nightclub  altercation.  This began Pac-Man Jones' NFL rap sheet.  He already had a lengthy one from high school and college.  September 5th, 2005, Adam was invited to attend the National Sports Council kickoff luncheon.  Jones went off on a verbal tarod while being told to wait for his car after the event.  Uh, he then refused to tip the valet service.  What's the big deal about that?  Well, uh, refusing to tip is something, you know. 
[01:56:30]  But, uh.  But that's where, that's where those type of things is.  Is Imus, if Imus can get out of this, if he, those type of things where it's like, that's  ridiculous, that's racial to even report something like that.  Right, right.  It goes on and on.  Let's see, uh.  There you go.  I think Imus will skate on this one because he can absolutely defend himself by saying,  look, I was saying, you know, it's not like, uh, his prior comment, which, you know,  you couldn't take it any other way.  What? 
[01:57:00]  Well, with the people.  Are you crazy?  No, no, with the people that are against Imus.  Like, I knew he was telling a joke and, and it was all stupid and silly and everything.  But, uh, this one, even his detractors have to agree.  Like, okay, he couldn't have meant this.  All right, let's, uh, move on with the Imus audience.  They arrest blacks for no reason.  And, I mean, there's no reason to arrest this kid six times.  I mean, maybe he did something once, but, I mean, everybody does something once.  Well, I have.  And, uh, but, I mean, that just. 
[01:57:30]  And when, when does it simply become harassment?  I didn't, I, I didn't, yeah, exactly.  Wow.  They shoot blacks for no reason.  He's all flustered now.  Oh, they shoot blacks for no reason.  Oh, my God.  Imus is trying so hard.  Imus is now the voice of the black man.  I'm, uh, now a black man.  I'm officially black, uh, uh, fight the power.  I hate to say this.  It's like, even if you after this guy and hate him, you go, this, he's just groveling. 
[01:58:00]  I'm groveling here, people.  Can you, uh, can you hear me?  Jesus.  Please don't fire me.  That's what, uh.  Yo, Patrice, my.  Hey, Don, what's up?  They're, uh, they're harassing us.  You know, I was driving, uh, home the other day.  I got pulled over by the, uh, by the man.  And, uh, he said, get out of the car.  And, uh, there was no reason.  I wasn't doing anything.  It's just because I'm black.  It's the only reason I, uh, I get pulled over and harassed like, uh, my black brothers. 
[01:58:30]  I mean, what did the kid do?  You hear he's talking about him like he's 10 years old and he stole some gum.  He's involved in shootings.  What are you, what's going on?  Let's go back to the Imus audio.  Yeah.  They shoot blacks for no reason.  Oh, boy.  And we all, we know about that in New York City.  I mean, we, we already understand all this.  So, and that in light of, I'm thinking.  Oh, my God.  That's the guy.  Can I translate this?  Oh, is he trying?  His mouth is trying up. 
[01:59:00]  Can I?  His mouth is trying up.  We've been at this a long time.  Can I translate?  Oh, please.  Please just let me keep my job.  Look, I just got this job.  Uh, could you just leave me alone?  Um, I, I say stupid things.  I hear panic in his voice.  I hear dry mouth like Patrice said.  But what is, what has he been talking about before this?  Let me tell you what a hero Rosa Parks was.  Like, what?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Before this fix-up.  I love that woman.  He's been on, back on the air, what, since, since November or something like that?  Yeah.  What has he been talking about? 
[01:59:30]  Like, this, this, after, this is his new problem?  What has he been talking about?  Muffin recipes?  Been talking about anything but race.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  First time it comes up.  Obama, he just, what, he just, he avoids that.  He avoids, it's like.  Look, I, I love, um, uh, peanut butter.  And if it wasn't for George Washington Carver, we wouldn't have any.  He was the master of the peanut.  And, uh, I just want people to recognize that.  That George Washington Carver was a great man. 
[02:00:00]  Well, what about Harriet Tubman, Don?  Harriet Tubman, uh, ran the Underground Railroad.  And, uh, uh, brought many, uh, slaves, uh, up to the north where they were then freed.  Uh, with that Frederick Douglass guy with the big beard.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Big white beard.  Might I say.  But that's before Dye.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Before, uh, just for men.  Kevin from Long Island writes, the funny thing is, uh, for the last hour, Ann has been saying 
[02:00:30]  he doesn't, uh, find black women attractive.  Imagine what would happen to Imas if he went on the air and said that.  I just don't find, uh, black women attractive.  Reverend Al, I'm outraged.  Why don't you find black women attractive?  Uh, because no matter what they look like, I always picture you, uh, Reverend Al, in bed.  You've ruined it for me.  You've ruined my, you've ruined my experience that I could have, uh, some jungle fever.  Because I just look at your face now, no matter how the girl looks. 
[02:01:00]  You big dummy.  Hey, dummy.  We have time to do more Imas audio?  All right.  Hey, dummy.  Let's try to get through this Imas audio.  Red fox.  Great, yeah.  We're running out of shell.  Here we go.  And that in light of, I'm thinking, that's this current edition of the Imas morning program  in which, I guess if you can't see it on RFTV, you don't know, but the producer of the Imas morning program,  Tom Bowman is black. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, here he goes.  Oh, my God.  Is he, oh, I love him.  He's in complete panic mode.  Oh, my God.  The producer, you can't see him.  He doesn't even realize this apology just is, it's, it's, it's right up anybody's alley  who wants his life.  Like, he's just selling it down the river.  What's he doing?  Yeah.  Just stop.  This edition of the Imas in the morning program is run completely by, uh, black people.  You had a good run.  Like, go out like a soldier. 
[02:02:00]  You blubber and, like, I, I'm sorry, Don.  Stop.  I'm kind of with you, Patricia.  Stop.  Exactly.  Stop.  If this was the street, I'm taking your money every day.  Every day I'm going to take your money.  Every day.  I'm, give me your money.  Come here, man.  Come here.  You got a one, a black one?  Come here, man.  Give me, how much money you got?  How much money you got?  If I check you and you got more than I find, I'm going to smack you in your face, Don.  All right.  Here you go.  I'll see you tomorrow.  Don, how much money you got on you? 
[02:02:30]  How much?  I got, um, $385.  You sure?  Because if I check you and you got more, I'm going to punch you in your face.  Oh, here's $516.  Is that it?  Look at me in my eye, Don.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that it?  Okay, $832 is yours.  All right, look, man.  I have it all here in my pocket.  My pockets are empty now.  Yo, shut up, man.  I'm going to see you tomorrow.  Okay.  All right, I'm going to let you keep your job.  I'm sorry I did that.  But you owe me.  Now, you should rather die.  Not even, like, does he understand? 
[02:03:00]  Man, like, it's like, will you stop blubbering?  We have to take a break.  We're running out of show.  This is an unnecessary amount of apologizing that's going on here.  We'll play the rest of the Imus audio after the break.  Stay right there.  Patrice O'Neill in for Jim Norton today.  Norton's going to be back Thursday.  He's out there in La La Land.  Thursday.  Is he really?  He's doing the gong show with David Tell, one of the judges.  Patrice doing a great job today. 
[02:03:30]  We're in the middle of playing Imus' apology here on the Opie and Anthony show.  The apology goes on and on, and it's completely unnecessary.  Yeah, we'll pick it up pretty much where we left off, okay?  Imus trying to explain why he said what he said yesterday.  Stop being a little bitch.  Stop.  Yeah.  I mean, we already understand all this.  So, and that in light of, I'm thinking, that's this current edition of the Imus of Morning 
[02:04:00]  program in which, I guess if you can't see it on RFTV, you don't know, but the producer  of the Imus of Morning program, Tom Bowman is black.  I was telling Patrice during the break, whenever a white guy is accused of being a racist, our  defense right away is, what are you talking about?  I got black friends.  I know this.  I hang out with black people.  Black guys?  Did you see?  It sounded like he made a...  And he's black, and then the music sort of went...  All right, you want to do it that way? 
[02:04:30]  All right, hold on a minute.  We can do that.  The way he said it was so...  All right.  We can do that.  Give us a second.  A little lost in powers you need?  Bam, bam, bam!  You got it over there, Ed.  In case you didn't know.  Hold on.  It's just...  But...  This current edition of the Imus of Morning program in which, I guess if you can't see  it on RFT TV, you don't know, but the producer of the Imus of Morning program, Tom Bowman 
[02:05:00]  is black.  Give me one more time.  What are you doing, Imus?  That's the best you got.  I got black friends.  The producer.  The current edition of the Imus of Morning program in which, I guess if you can't see  it on RFT TV, you don't know, but the producer of the Imus of Morning program, Tom Bowman is 
[02:05:30]  black.  And you know, Tom is over in the booth rolling his eyes going, oh, this old gag.  I got to be the fall guy.  Yeah, thanks a lot.  I wear a Kentucky Fried Chicken apron every day.  What's the matter with him?  Producer?  What's the matter with him?  You got one more in you? 
[02:06:00]  Uh, sure.  Let's try this one.  I guess if you can't see it on RFT TV, you don't know, but the producer of the Imus of  Morning program, Tom Bowman is black.  Two of the co-hosts and cast members of the program are black.  Oh, my God.  He's going to eat this.  We have eight black listeners.  And I'm wearing black socks today. 
[02:06:30]  Jeez.  Anyone?  Anyone?  Black.  Two of the co-hosts and cast members of the program are black.  Carol Foster and Tony Powell.  What?  How?  Oh, he's stuttering.  Oh, man.  Oh, because he knows Reverend Al is just rallying the troops.  I have a black army with me.  This saying, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, but that is a complete farce.  Oh, I, I, I.  He should just go. 
[02:07:00]  He should learn from the old thing.  It's like, no matter what he does, they're going to.  This is awful.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  This is awful.  Why don't you watch Usual Suspects, Don, and stuff?  Kaiser Sosa killed his whole family so nobody will hold him hostage.  Like, why don't you stop?  Let's get to the end of this.  Let's get to the end of this.  That was a badass.  You held my family hostage?  Why don't I just kill him?  I'll kill him.  And then we won't have a deal. 
[02:07:30]  Kill yourself.  Kill your black co-host and your black producer and stop groveling.  Oh, damn.  What's the matter with him?  Let's get to the end of the clip.  Yeah.  Well, the cast members of the program are black, Carol Foster and Tony Powell.  What, how insane would I have to be, what would I, what would I be thinking?  What would I mean?  Well, why would I sit here and say, oh, yeah, there you go.  I mean, how does anybody, how does anybody, how do you get, make that connection? 
[02:08:00]  I mean, I know, I know there's some people.  Wow.  My, uh, my tires are black on my car.  I just want to let people know that.  That's how George Bush explains Condoleezza and Colin Powell when he's done.  I, you know, I have, um, yeah.  Yeah.  Condoleezza, one of my highest reigns, Condoleezza.  Great Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, so I can do whatever I want.  She, she, she, she.  Make it an apology. 
[02:08:30]  You've never heard Bush.  As racist as people think he is and awful, he's never really made an apology.  Why would he have to?  He's never said, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  What is the matter with, I got Mexicans.  I got them all.  And finally, I misended with this.  I mean, I know, I know there's some people who want to get me, but this, you're not going  to get me for, this is ridiculous.  Uh-oh.  You know what it reminded me of, I, man?  It's like Joe McCarthy, the 1950s witch hunt. 
[02:09:00]  I mean, they're looking for something and there's nothing there.  He's just, he's just saying, please stop, this ain't fair.  Yeah.  Please stop.  Stop it.  He's begging for mercy.  Please, no fair, no fairsies.  Oh, God, man.  It is a witch hunt, though, because they're all over it today on the news.  It's ridiculous that that's top story news.  Did Don Imus say something racist again?  That's what they're doing.  So he's got to get on the air.  Everyone I know now is black.  I'm sick of us doing, like, black, we should just be doing something else. 
[02:09:30]  We have nothing else to do but wait for Don Imus to mess up?  Yeah.  Like, get out of here.  That man doesn't care.  He's smoking weed and robbing somebody right now.  Laughing at Don Imus.  He's like, wow, that white boy's sticking up for me?  That's cool.  And Don Imus is just like, just give the man your money.  Why are you resisting?  Let him rob you.  Patrice O'Neal is going to be at the Improv in Houston, Texas this weekend. 
[02:10:00]  3rd, 4th, and 5th of July.  All right, next weekend.  Yes, 3rd, 4th, and 5th of July.  Very nice.  PatriceO'Neal.com?  Yes, sir.  I'll be at Staten, New York this weekend, too.  In another city.  Right, right.  All right.  We're out.  Catch you.  Bye.  Bye.  Radio Shock Jock.  L.P. and Anthony.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps. 
[02:10:30]  Enkle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show. 
[02:11:00]  Out of touch cornwalls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I can't have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver. 
[02:11:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Classic opening.  Yeah.  I think we're good, right?  XM Satellite Radio, the Opie and Anthony Show, featuring Patrice O'Neal today for the vacationing Jim Norton.  Vacationing?  I don't know.  I like when they say that.  No, actually, Jimmy's out there in L.A. doing David Tell's gong show.  I like that they're bringing back some of the old game shows.  Yeah.  But I saw in the paper today that Reverend Al, what the hell's wrong with me? 
[02:12:00]  I got Reverend Al on.  Yeah, Al Roker.  I got Al on the brain today.  Al Roker is hosting the new Family Feud, the Celebrity Family Feud.  Yes.  That's a special.  Oh, is it?  It's just a special?  Yeah.  What, they're just doing a few?  Do you?  Yes.  She has a mouthful of pickle.  Sorry about that.  But Al Roker is a...  The guy from Seinfeld hosts the regular one.  Remember the guy that played Beat Peterman?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This is just a primetime special.  Oh, I got you.  But Al Roker is a game show host.  Yeah, but he has that goofy, like, I'll just be goofy, like, you know.  He's so bad at being goofy.  Yeah.  Like, he's stupid goofy.  He's not funny goofy.  And he has that black rage that white people don't see.  Yeah.  But black people see it.  Yeah.  Oh, he hates white people.  Oh, my God.  He's got to be the jolly weatherman.  And there is a lot of hatred in that man.  You can see on the last Imus thing that happened, he got out there and said that he went and said 
[02:13:00]  he couldn't work for the same company that would employ Imus.  And it was like, wait, isn't this the goofy weatherman guy with the big, fat California  raisin head?  Oh, look, look, look, look.  I'm truly upset about the comments.  Obviously, Mr. Imus has problems with African-Americans.  I'm upset, and I hope the station, and that's all we got, because they went to another graphic.  That was Pac-Man Jones, part of his statement.  That was Pac-Man's statement.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, he's upset. 
[02:13:30]  Somebody's telling Pac-Man to be upset.  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to be upset about this.  He don't give a fuck.  Guys, MSNBC did a really shitty version of the words you cannot say on television.  I don't know if you guys have this, but please look it up and just bash it.  Can we try to find that?  See if it's worth doing.  Thank you, Matt O'Sullivan.  We like when the listeners help us out with the radio show.  Hey, Matt O'Sullivan, don't you know?  Speaking of Imus, last week, a lot of people thought Al Sharpton was writing about Anthony  and I. It was a fake blog, but people really thought it was Al Sharpton's blog. I got the 
[02:14:00]  Google alert, and I read it. I started laughing my ass off. I'm like, God damn, that's funny.  Yeah.  But other people really thought it was Al Sharpton's blog. It was kind of like an onion thing.  Yeah.  It was a goof.  It was a goof. But in case you haven't come across this yet, let me read this.  Al Sharpton's blog, I hope a white person does something racist because I have nothing to  do this weekend. And it's kind of funny that this came out last week considering the fact  that Imus kind of got himself in some trouble yesterday. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  Getting a lot of attention today, Mr. Imus. By Al Sharpton. They're even allowed to say  by Al Sharpton if you're lampooning.  I don't know. It says, it's been quiet around here for a little while. I'm not bored, just  it's quieter than usual. Okay, fine. Here's the deal. I had plans for Saturday, and it was  something that was going to be like an all-day thing, but they just called and canceled.  Like, literally just got off the phone, and now I got nothing to do. My weekend is suddenly  empty, and all my friends are busy because I told them I was going to be busy. I'm just 
[02:15:00]  saying it might be cool if something happened that really pissed me off. Then I'd have shit  to do. Nothing big. I'm not picky. Maybe a sports announcer can say Negro while referring  to a brother athlete, or a white police officer could get let off for beating an African-American  gentleman who was escorting his mama to church. Yeah, that'd be good. See, I'm already starting  to get a little pissed off just thinking about it, and that's good. Nothing kills time like  a good old-fashioned boycott. And let's just say I've been listening extra hard to Howard 
[02:15:30]  Stern and those Opie and Anthony fellas, and the second they slip the N-word, I'm going  to rain down on their ass like the next Katrina. Ah, Katrina. Man, oh man, oh man. Those were  the days. Not a second went by that I wasn't on TV being all like, shit's fucked up. Or on  the radio going like, Bush is a demon. But you know, I got to move on. This is a lifestyle.  No living in the past. Come on, Opie and Anthony, you know you want to. Just say the word.  The N-word. Who fucking does that anyway? Cancels plans for the weekend so soon. I was looking 
[02:16:00]  forward to it. I hadn't seen this friend in a while. Dumbass. Yeah, that obviously wasn't  Reverend Al. Some people thought it was, though. Who would think that was Reverend Al? Some people.  Some. Some people. By the way, at 11 o'clock today, or around there, when we end our live  show today, we're going to replay our last interview with the great George Carlin.  Oh. I remember that. And it was only four months ago, something like that? Yeah. I remember 
[02:16:30]  thinking when the last time he was in that he didn't look too good. He looked a little  puffy. Really? And they're saying he died of heart failure. Yeah. Puffy. Well, when you  start getting puffy, it's that, what is it called? Edema or something like that? Yo,  Edema. Yeah, the water just starts kind of slowly but surely. Building up. Building up  and they say you like drown in your own fluids eventually. That's nice. I don't know if it  got to that point with Mr. Carlin, but they're saying heart failure at this point. That was 
[02:17:00]  a surprise, though, right? 71? Yeah. Kind of. It was one of those things, not a surprise,  like, oh my God, but it came out of nowhere. 71's young for heart failure.  Yeah. Because heart failure is not a heart attack. But he had the heart, it just got  too weak to keep the person alive. He'd had problems over the years. Yeah. Yeah.  Mm. Me and Patrice, Patrice was watching me play yes, no, no, yes, no on the way here. 
[02:17:30]  Oh. On the walkover. So he was picking out girls? Yeah. And was he being fair? So many  knows. One yes. And a lot of white girls going by that were just no, no, no, never, wouldn't  ever happen. No, no, no. And then, yeah, a couple of black girls walked by. There was  one that, I don't know where you went, I guess you went to go get something to eat. There  was one that I said, I go, now that's one that Patrice would go, oh yeah, absolutely. 
[02:18:00]  And I said, there's no way in hell I would want to see that naked. And I know you would  have been all over it. Yeah. She had like a big booty. I'm telling you. Big titties, but  they were weird. I would love a piece of your girl's friend there that hosts the news there.  What, you'll want the... ISIS or whatever it was? Who? India. Oh, oh, the...  Patricia Del Rio? No, the big juicy one that works on the desk with the big lips, the puffy 
[02:18:30]  lips. Big one. Big. Who's he talking about? Now I'm confused. Suki. Yeah. Who's Suki? She's  the one that comes on at like eight o'clock. I like to do a three with her. When they switch  it up. Oh, show me some Suki. I like to do a little three with her. Oh, I think I know  who you're talking about. Me, her and my girl. She's a nice romp. Hey, you got that  Pac-Man Jones thing again? She's fun. She's like a fun girl. This is what Pac-Man Jones 
[02:19:00]  said. Here's the whole statement. I'm truly upset about the comments. Jones said, obviously  Mr. Imus has problems with African-Americans. I'm upset and I hope the station he works for  handles it accordingly. I will pray for him. I will pray for him. I hate the I will pray  for him bullshit. What is that? No, you're not praying for him. Jesus is trying to chew.  He's got a point to make. You're praying that he gets fired is what you're praying.  You're not praying for the guy personally. Fuck no. Here's a guy who had his entire career  taken from him for a year. And he thought unfairly. Yeah. And he would never make a statement 
[02:19:30]  like that on his own. Yeah, that's a spokesperson. Somebody pressured him to do that because there's  no way Pac-Man is kind of what it is. Pressured him. Somebody wrote that for him. That's how  that stuff works. And then they throw it at you and you go, yeah, I think I'd say this.  Yeah, it's close. Pac-Man Jones would go, I don't give a fuck what he said. That's what  he was saying. Yeah. And they go, no, you got to put out a statement that you do care. 
[02:20:00]  Along with the Rutgers girls who went, fuck him. Yeah, they never heard it. All right,  we're going to move on to some other stuff for now. Good question coming in from what's  Sam's take on what? What's with a Z. Sam's take on what WUT happened to Vince McMahon last  night. CC in Cleveland. Oh, my God. Well, we were kind of going to blow this off because  it was so hack. Hack? Now that you bring it up, we do have to get Sam Roberts in here.  Young Sam Roberts. Obviously, huge news, but not on the news. I didn't see this happen on 
[02:20:30]  the news. Much like when Vince's limo exploded. Yeah. And he had to bail out of that one because  Chris Benoit killed his family and he had to bail out of that one. And you know Vince was  pissed off. Thanks a lot for going on my spot. I had a great angle that I've been thinking  about for a long time. Well, the latest thing to happen to Vince, obviously, some type of  malfunction on stage. Yeah. Or perhaps sabotage. I want to hear from Sam about this. Some stage 
[02:21:00]  equipment and part of the set and lighting rigs fell down and fell on Mr. McMahon. Is  this what I'm being led to believe, Sam? Well, it was the conclusion of Vince giving away his  million dollars because he's been giving away a million dollars a week. Yeah, and that sounded  really authentic. The guy on the phone that won? Well, he won $500,000, which was the biggest  because he called five people before that and they each won $100,000. Uh-huh. And so this 
[02:21:30]  final winner won $500,000. Wow. Sounds very fake. No. Are the authorities looking into Vince  McMahon? I don't think he's really giving away this money. Yeah. He's been giving it away for  the past three weeks. A million dollars a week. Man, I bet you he found a loophole. We got  to get the WWE on the phone and ask him how they could go on the air and give away a million  dollars without actually giving it away. Actually doing it. You know what that would do for this 
[02:22:00]  radio show if we could pull that one off? Yeah. He's not giving away the money, Sam. How  did he get around this? It's his own money. Of course it is. It is a way to thank the fans  and to bring the old fans back. Is anyone questioning him? I want to be the one that questions Vince  McMahon. I'm an accountant. Prove that you actually gave away the million dollars. Eric and  me went to the press conference. Oh, you did? Yes. The media was alerted. And so it's  for real. He's giving away a million dollars a week. But as of now, I thought I was going  to enter to win next week's million dollars. And it's not on the website anymore. The contest 
[02:22:30]  is at least suspended because of what happened. Well, what I'm seeing is Vince is... Well,  we got the audio. Let's play the audio for everybody. Yeah. You can find the ridiculous  video online. Well, ridiculously upsetting video. Yeah. There he goes. Falling into the  hole in the floor. Well, it's not a hole. Oh, it's the edge of the stage? What is it?  I think something in the paneling fell through. Yeah. Yeah. So there was some sabotage. Could 
[02:23:00]  have been some sabotage. Or we led to believe that there was some sabotage. I mean, in the  15-year history of Raw, I have never seen the set fall apart like that. I like how the set  fell right at the hinged portion. Yeah. And you could see, if you rewind that, you could  see the locks come out and the thing falls down. This big lighting rig falls down exactly  where it's supposed to. No, it's not supposed to fall. And he has plenty of room underneath 
[02:23:30]  the lighting rig to survive. Yeah, it didn't hit him. It didn't hit him. The lighting rig did  not hit Mr. McMahon whatsoever. It's supposed to light the arena. He had a protected area that  that he was able to get into. And then the thing falls down looking like he might have  been crushed. If it's on the ground, it's not safe and it's darker. It has to be lit  for TV. That's what the lighting stuff is there for. And then you got the good guys and the  bad guys working together, which is just amazing. You can hear... Because they've got to save  Vince McMahon. Yeah. You can hear the panic in the voices in the audio. Yeah. Well, of course 
[02:24:00]  you can. They're all panicking and helping to try to lift this big heavy thing off of the  thing that is keeping it from hitting Vince by about three feet. I mean, Triple H and  John Cena are going to be wrestling for the title this Sunday. But let me tell you something  about Triple H. His acting was awful because in real life, Triple H wants Vince McMahon to  die because then he becomes a billionaire. No. That's kind of true. No. He's married to  Stephanie McMahon who would inherit a shitload of money if Pops dies. Look. So why would 
[02:24:30]  Triple H be in a panic? Because... Why? I'm sure he loves Vince. He loves him as a  father-in-law and all that crap. Right. You know. But money's money. I mean... Yeah. You  get past that initial mourning phase and you realize... Holy shit, I'm a billionaire. You  own the WWE. Right. Right. We're dealing with human beings here. Yeah. Are we? Really? Yeah.  There's a neck brace going on. Mr. McMahon, he looks unconscious. The EMTs are there helping  him out and they kind of look like wrestlers dressed like EMTs. Why is that? Well, because they 
[02:25:00]  would have to get large EMTs to work these shows because the wrestlers are heavy. Oh. That makes  sense. If you're going to lift a wrestler, you've got to be one of the bigger EMTs. But  I don't think an EMT worker should be on steroids. There's no steroids involved. Like look at  that guy with the big shaved head. Who's that? Yeah. That's an EMT. There's another guy with  a ponytail. Yeah. Aren't these like the old jobbers? What are these guys? I know. There's  no jobbers there. No. He was Leap and Lenny Poffo. Yeah. The Brooklyn Brawler I think 
[02:25:30]  I saw him holding a stethoscope. I always wondered what Ivan Putsky was doing in retirement. I  didn't know Vince McMahon still had him on the payroll. Yeah, he's on the payroll. Now  he's an EMT. That's an old EMT guy. Those men are not trained EMTs. Why don't we play the  audio? Because this was just amazing for Sam. Yeah. Can you give me the password? He's  in the middle of giving away the $500,000. All this guy's got to do is give Vince the password.  Vince is on the phone with this gentleman. You've got to give him the password. Listen to 
[02:26:00]  the winner. Because, wow, it really sounds authentic. Can you give me the password?  Night of champions.  Guess what? You've just won a half of a million dollars. Congratulations.  I love you, Vince. You do? That is so fake. What are you talking about? I love you, Vince.  You can't have a fake contest. I'm calling the authorities. I'm calling the authorities. 
[02:26:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, patience. I love you, Vince. You do? I love you, Vince.  Now that's the first lighting rig. Yeah, it fell. It fell right next to you.  $500,000,000. It's quite a shock. Was it some sparkles? Yeah, yeah. Some spots. Oh, yeah.  Stages fell apart. Some pyros malfunction. You have to see a bunch of lighting equipment 
[02:27:00]  is falling. Yeah. Listen to that. Listen to the way they yell, Vince. Are they yelling that  because he's trapped in the safe area? See the hinges? Look where it's hinged. Yeah.  And watch. You'll see a little thing release before this falls down. Now, why is that, Sam?  He doesn't even have the balls. He's already in the safe area. Watch the bottom part. Watch  this little thing release. This is a safe area. You see that? See? I'll tell you this. 
[02:27:30]  It's a mechanism. If there was a mechanism. And he played it really safe because he made sure  he was in between the two pylons just in case he didn't get in the safe area in time.  So it would be like a Charlie Chaplin thing. No, because if there is a mechanism there,  it would just be so they could safely take it down after the show. It was certainly so  predictable. Oh, I gotcha. Look at the safe area he's in. Yeah, he's not even hurt. It's  not even close to hurting him. This is a... Lightbulb sparkles. Dude, this is the best they  could do? This is a multi-million dollar HDTV television set falling on you. There's no safe 
[02:28:00]  area. That's a safe area. He made sure he got between the pylons and then in the safe.  Nothing was going to hit Mr. McMahon. Yeah, I think Mr. McMahon's fine. Yes. Why wasn't he  moving after it hit him if he was in that safe area? Probably the same reason that he was alive  after his limo blew up. It's fake. Oh my. And why is this on CNN? I mean, a billionaire almost died  on live TV. Like, why is it... Look, we got all the news channels on. We don't know what condition 
[02:28:30]  he's in. Do you know what condition he's in? No, but I'll tell you, I think I know why the  news channels aren't covering this. There's not a lot of information, but they are doing  a press conference that they're going to stream on their website at 1 p.m. today. Why would  they have to stream it on their website, Sam? Why wouldn't CNN pick it up? Why wouldn't we  just all watch CNN? This is Vince McMahon. He's, you know, a pretty big name. I'm saying after  the press conference will probably be when it hits all the news because we'll get more information.  I want to see the press because I bet they're big, strong guys holding the camera and the 
[02:29:00]  big, burly guys holding microphones. All roided out because they can still do steroids because  they're not actually in matches anymore. Yeah, there's no steroids involved. I know  the guys that are now, like, wrestling, they're off the roids because everyone's paying attention,  but the behind-the-scenes guys, they're still roiding their asses off. Well, the behind-the-scenes  guys don't work for the press. Yeah, what does the FIC have to say about this whole thing?  Are we going down that road again? And what did that stand for? The Federal Investigation  Committee. Right, right. And I'll say this. That's who was in charge when Vince's limo blew 
[02:29:30]  up. But the first time we saw that, they had said the FBI. And the FBI had put out a statement  saying, we are not involved in any investigation with the WWE. So they transferred. Oh, they  transferred over to the FBI. What did Sam say about the fact that Vince came out and said  it was all crap? Yeah. Because he explained that, and I forgave him. He said that...  You forgave him for it. So you admit that that was a farce? No, because he said he fake  killed himself to see if the people still loved him. Oh. And I said, well, that makes sense. 
[02:30:00]  Because he thought that the fans... But you did... You said he was fake. That his fake death  was fake. Well, yeah, because he said it was. But you did believe it at first. Well, yeah.  Yeah. I mean, the limo blew up. Was you disappointed after that? I was... No, I was very much relieved  that he's still alive. Oh, by the way, uh... Well, let's let... Akeel, it looks like. Akeel?  Yeah, man. Somebody please smack Sam. I'm about as much as a wrestler's fan as Sam, if not 
[02:30:30]  more. But this is the same time last year he did the same stunt with the limo.  Karma, man. Was that a year ago? It's a year to the day. It's actually like...  So is that going to be his new thing? Once a year he almost dies?  Hey, you know what I'm saying? I mean, you know, you gotta love this. The man's a genius  and stuff, but... Because this is the... I think like today or tomorrow is the same time  when the whole thing came out about Benoit. Yeah.  Which, like a week before, he did the whole limo stunt and after Benoit...  He probably sent out a press conference. Look, you wrestlers, none of you kill yourself 
[02:31:00]  the next few months. I got a new storyline.  If you kill yourselves, I'm gonna kill your whole family. You're not supposed to kill  yourself when I'm doing a stunt. Do you understand me? I'm gonna have a giant rig fall on top  of me and everyone's gonna think I'm injured. So if one of you sons of bitches kills themselves,  your whole family's gonna die. That's right, the whole family. Even though you're dead, you're 
[02:31:30]  fuck. Yeah, fuck. This one's gotta play out. I'm gonna make it last a month and I'm gonna  come hobbling out on crutches one day and then someone's gonna hit me with a chair. Just in  time for the next pay-per-view. Yeah. What's this Sunday? Night of Champions. What is this?  Night of Champions. Night of Champions. Boy, I wonder if we're gonna get another piece of the puzzle this Sunday during the pay-per-view.  Oh, the belts are up for grass.  All of them.  All of them. 
[02:32:00]  Will I be there? No, because I'm injured.  Here's something, Vince. Pay-per-views aren't that special if you do them every four weeks.  I mean, Muhammad Ali used to have a pay-per-view once every two years. Everyone was watching. When you have a pay-per-view every four weeks...  He doesn't even wait a month anymore. No.  It's four weeks.  He actually just did a pay-per-view and then two weeks and then another pay-per-view.  We do them every two weeks now.  I don't understand how somebody can't understand it, how that's crazy. 
[02:32:30]  All right, listen. Let's go to Brad in Jersey. Brad, how are you, sir?  Hey, guys. I want to know if Sam noticed that after Vince came to when the EMTs were taking care of him, he started calling out the Triple H, but he was calling him by his real name, All.  Exactly. You think they're gonna break that storyline?  Ah.  That's pretty good.  We got the audio. He said he couldn't feel his legs.  All right, let's get to the second part of the audio.  Reach into the register and pull out my money. Brad. 
[02:33:00]  Brad.  Here we go. Here we go.  All right, are you gonna be able to stand up?  I don't know, Nicole.  I can stand up.  I'm going to slide him out a little bit. Slide him out. Get him out. Come under this first.  Paul.  You okay?  Paul.  Paul.  You okay?  You all right? You all right? Okay?  I can't go by legs.  Don't move. Jesus Christ.  Don't move.  You're gonna be all right.  I can't go by legs.  Just lie down.  Just lie down, okay? 
[02:33:30]  Don't let him move, you guys.  All right, I'll give Vince this much.  Yeah.  If he ends up in a wheelchair for the next three months, I'm watching every fucking week.  Oh, that'd be great.  Because Vince McMahon in a wheelchair could be just wheeling around.  They have to put a ramp up to the ring.  And then, of course, during a pay-per-view, all of a sudden, he'll miraculously be able  to stand up.  He'll walk, put on that Vince face, and his legs will be shaking.  Maybe after serious physical therapy, hopefully.  Yeah.  Hopefully.  Well, yeah.  We can only hope there, Sam. 
[02:34:00]  Fucking Sam.  Right.  You're a douche.  What are you talking about?  I mean, I'm assuming they're still in the hospital in San Antonio right now.  Right.  Get Triple H on the phone right now.  Yeah.  Call your WWE people and get him on.  We want to know the condition.  I want to talk to Paul.  I want to know the condition of Vince McMahon.  I would assume that Triple H is probably with his father-in-law in the hospital, and they  probably don't have...  Bedside vigil?  Exactly.  And they don't let cell phones in the hospital.  Well, you know, Al Sharpton, oh boy, new developments, pop that up. 
[02:34:30]  He brought up race, and this is something that is, given who it is talking, that is very  disturbing to groups like National Action Network, our group, and others that have been monitoring  him and others since the remarks he made last year.  His statements this morning clarified...  I was looking whiter and whiter every day.  He looks like a white man now.  ...so we're looking into this.  We'll be talking later today. 
[02:35:00]  Sharpton helped lead the charge to get IMAs fired last year.  IMAs' current employers say they don't expect any action will need to be taken.  Store owners unstocking their shelves.  The couple's livelihood in danger.  Shut up.  McMahon exploits paraplegics.  Classic.  That's coming in from CW.  You know he's going to do that.  If, well, he couldn't feel his legs.  That's the last thing we knew.  Oh, is that it?  He said, I can't feel my legs.  Maybe we'll find out more tonight.  Paralyzed Vince will be great. 
[02:35:30]  He got paralyzed by a life fixture that didn't hit him.  No.  It was the whole set coming down on him.  It didn't touch him.  Wait, the GM of SmackDown's in a wheelchair?  What, Sam?  You don't tell us this?  They're setting up a wheelchair match.  Wheelchair match.  That's the GM of SmackDown.  And that'd be Vicky Guerrero, Eddie Guerrero's widow, who is now having an affair with Edge,  the world champion.  But she's in a wheelchair.  Yeah, she's been in a wheelchair for a really long time.  I don't even...  For real?  No.  I don't even really remember why she's there. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, look, Sam's not even going to play on that one.  No, he ain't.  He's not trying to sell that one.  She got gorilla press slammed a couple weeks ago.  Oh, by the way, yeah, Sam, the tough questions are now coming in for you.  Dave in Tennessee.  Yes, Dave.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Sam, I was wondering where in the EMT protocol, is it a good idea to ask a patient, can you  stand up, if they might be paralyzed?  He has a neck injury.  The EMT said, can you stand up?  That's something that won't happen. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, Sam.  He doesn't know yet.  Everyone else, the wrestlers are smart enough to say, don't move, don't move.  Don't move him.  Put the EMT guys like, can you stand up?  Hey, walk it off, dick.  You know what?  One rookie EMT is not going to stop this whole thing.  Good point, Dave.  Good point.  Sam is a douche.  That's coming in a lot.  What?  Jordan from Pittsburgh is leading the charge, calling you a douche today.  Why?  Yeah.  It doesn't make any sense to me.  I'm just...  Yeah, it doesn't.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm just trying to explain why I might seem distant today. 
[02:37:00]  First of all, the director of the show didn't think to not show Vince not being hit by him.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  And the camera is so close to his face, anyone in their right mind would go, get that fucking  camera away.  Yeah.  We need room to work here.  But the camera was right on Vince.  Yeah.  You know what?  Vince would have wanted it that way.  He always said...  He always wanted it that way.  Is he dead?  Are you saying he's died?  I...  You know, I was scared for a minute because he was not...  He's been obsessed with his storyline that got fucked up last year. 
[02:37:30]  He's like, I need to do this storyline.  I just got to rework it now.  I'll wait a year and rework it.  I'm coming back in a wheelchair.  And what if he was still at the point where he wasn't pretending wrestling wasn't fake anymore?  Yeah.  Like he was still trying to pretend it was real.  Yeah.  And then he had to come out and go, it's fake.  All of it's fake.  It's all fake.  Do you think the CEO of a publicly traded company is going to pretend to be in a wheelchair?  Well, how did this affect the stock also? 
[02:38:00]  Because when a CEO like that gets injured to that extent where we don't even know if he's alive or dead,  how's that affecting the stock today?  I've been so concerned with the humanity of it that I haven't checked the business end yet.  Oh, okay.  He is an unlucky motherfucker as all those explosions are happening around him.  Yeah.  How funny would it be?  And as he fell in a hole and then he gets up and goes, holy shit, there's more light bulb explosions.  But how funny was it?  Was it their electric, was it the overload? 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  What happened?  What happened?  How funny would it have been if he got paralyzed for real like doing a fake fucking story angle?  Oh, no.  I believe him.  Like he didn't step aside and he hits him in the head.  That would have been awful.  Yeah.  It's the first thing people think when-  Oh, so you're admitting it's fake?  No.  I'm saying if that had happened, it would have been awful.  But this whole thing-  But it's awful because he's really injured, Sam.  Exactly.  What are you trying to say?  Exactly.  That's why it's awful.  It happens every time a wrestler really dies, everyone thinks it's a work.  Yeah.  So you don't buy it at first.  Which is why they don't fake these things anymore. 
[02:39:00]  Anymore.  Well, when is the press conference?  Well, the press conference is today at one and then we'll probably-  All right.  So we'll have CNN on at one o'clock.  Okay.  I'll give the word to Ron and Fez and then they'll broadcast the press conference live.  They're big wrestling fans.  I'm sure they'll want to see that on.  CNN, MSNBC, Fox News.  They're going to be all over this one.  All of them.  I'm sure all the major networks will-  Because now there might be a murderer out there.  This is attempted murder.  So, I mean, CNN's got to be all over this.  Who would have done it, though?  Anybody dislike Vince? 
[02:39:30]  Well, you know what I'm thinking?  With him giving away a million dollars a week, a lot of wrestlers could have been quite  bitter that maybe that money wasn't going into their paychecks.  They didn't understand why he's just giving away a million bucks.  Oh, by the way, Tim H. from Columbus writes,  The WWE stock is also fake.  It looks like Monopoly money.  Well, what is that supposed to mean?  Well, you know, you get excited that your stock's going up, but in the end, you have Monopoly  money.  It's not real.  This is a legitimate company.  Okay?  All right. 
[02:40:00]  All right.  Trying to get Triple H on the phone for you, Sam.  Well, it would be great to hear from him.  We would absolutely love to hear from somebody.  Well, E-Rock's been in communications with them.  What are they saying, E-Rock?  Go on the air.  E-Rock?  From WWE Public Relations.  The wounds are fresh.  The family is rallying around the chairman.  We're not sure if we can get a hold of Triple H, but we are trying.  Wow.  Rallying around the chairman.  It's not exactly the time to do press. 
[02:40:30]  You know what I mean?  Oh, well, of course.  Like, this press conference was already scheduled well in advance.  Yeah, he has new paralysis.  You know, you can't just get interviewed right after 25 hours after paralysis.  God forbid.  It's like swimming an hour after you eat.  It's like...  You need time to get your paralysis right.  Can't they just put the phone by his face so we can talk to him for a couple of seconds?  Come on.  Can we be a little humane about this?  No.  There's no statement?  Where's the statement?  Yeah.  There has not been a statement yet because we don't know...  That's the first official word we've heard right there. 
[02:41:00]  It's on our show.  Yes.  From them is that the family is rallying around the chairman.  The day of the year is good to us.  They will always give us the scoop.  Why is Vicky Guerrero a GM?  Because they've got to get her a job somehow.  All right.  Well, we're going to be...  Goddamn sad.  We're going to be recording the press conference.  We'll have more.  Oh, please.  You got it.  I want to hear these bad questions that these bad fake fucking reporters ask.  I think you're real. 
[02:41:30]  Mr. McMahon's family.  What caused the light explosions?  Yeah.  What caused that?  Well, there's so much technology involved now in putting these shows on that it could  have been anything.  And that's also what I want to know.  It could have been sabotaged, though.  That's what I'm saying.  And why...  And who boom-miked the explosion of the...  Like, who boom-miked that?  Yeah.  It was really loud.  How it goes, kabloom.  I almost saw the words, kabloo.  Kabloomy.  Kabloomy.  Kabloomy.  That's the thing he's doing. 
[02:42:00]  Well, they get the local high school to do the special effects for this thing, so there's  no special effects.  That's why...  No, they weren't special at all.  Rich S. from Kansas City writes, Vince was paralyzed when his spine was hit with a severe  case of the douche chills.  It froze solid, but will thaw out in time for the next WrestleMania.  So that's good news.  Well, I hope that he's okay for the next WrestleMania.  He was curled up on the floor in a completely comfortable space.  Yeah.  Where nothing was there.  It was after he had been hit.  He didn't even play it off where he stood up until the thing came down and then ducked. 
[02:42:30]  That's the problem.  The angle, we don't know.  The angle was perfect.  We don't know how awful it was set up.  If he was standing and let the thing almost hit him and then fell, that would have looked  good.  I know, but he was laying down.  And who doesn't run for your life as things are just blowing up and exploding?  Right, right.  He just stood there looking at lighting fixtures.  Why didn't the arena empty and the wrestlers that came to his rescue after it fell on him?  Yeah.  Quote, unquote.  What?  What were they doing as the explosions was going on? 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  They were just chilling, waiting for something to hit him?  They were in the ring.  And why was he standing exactly where that thing fell?  That's the question.  That's another.  That brings up Anthony's point of sabotage.  Because they knew he was going to be standing there.  Ah.  And the wrestlers are in the ring because it was the draft show.  And they set up some elaborate explosion.  To make that lamp fall right on him?  CW from Scranton is following the story.  We got updates.  Breaking news.  McMahon's gurney in hospital accidentally pushed downstairs.  Oh, no.  Still not dead. 
[02:43:30]  What?  And then more breaking news.  McMahon chokes on hospital food.  Still not dead.  Okay.  I think they're...  So CW is on the case here.  They're making light up.  You know how you get hired to be right on these?  It's like you take these existing scenarios, you take an existing thing, and you just finish  it.  Yeah.  Like you write it to its conclusion, like what is going to happen at the end of this whole  thing.  Yeah.  By the way, Sam, who thinks wrestling is real, Patrice used to write for the WWF. 
[02:44:00]  Well, I know you called it WWF.  He used to be on Vince McMahon's plane writing out storylines.  Yeah.  I mean, you got to send them in a direction, but I'm assuming they had some kind of cool,  nice thing written to end this big money.  And then all of a sudden the set crashed down and ruined everyone's plans.  And now somebody has to rewrite the paralysis.  Yeah.  Because the paralysis angle paralyzed Vince...  I can only hope that paralyzed Vince uses one of those old, old wheelchairs and a blanket  on his legs.  I'm sure.  Like I wanted to use one of those old wooden ones. 
[02:44:30]  Like the dead mother from Psycho?  Yeah, yeah.  One of those real old wheelchairs.  A crickety.  A crickety wheelchair.  And like a checkered blanket on his legs.  Yeah.  I certainly hope it doesn't come to that.  All right.  Listen, we got to take breaks.  Certainly.  Enough with your nonsense, Sam.  Get the hell out of here.  Sam is an ass.  What do you want from us?  It's good radio, but it's nonsense.  Go.  It's a complete buffoon.  After the live show today, we're replaying our last interview with George Carlin.  Going to play a little piece as we go to break here, okay? 
[02:45:00]  Right.  We'll continue with Patrice O'Neill in just a bit.  We want to say it to your face.  We're fortunate enough to interview a lot of people with this radio show.  And every once in a while, someone comes through that door where we're like starstruck and  a little freaked out.  And you're one of those guys.  Now calm down.  Well, right.  We're all obviously huge fans and we love everything you've done.  I really appreciate it.  50 years, right?  50 years since I went into radio in 1956.  Wow.  40 was just starting.  Rock and roll was just starting. 
[02:45:30]  I was 18 and I had the advantage of having a car down in Shreveport.  I was in Shreveport, Louisiana.  I was in the Air Force.  And I could go out at night and tell the chick, hey, you want to hear a song tomorrow?  I'll dedicate it to you.  What do you want?  You know, it was magic.  Magic, man.  Two paychecks.  Didn't have to do anything on the air base.  Just do my show.  Radio has just never changed as far as that goes.  That's why most people got into radio was for the free CDs. 
[02:46:00]  Well, free CDs now, whatever.  Free music and hopefully picking up a few extra women on the side.  And trade-outs with the sponsors.  Right, right.  This is Vince McMahon of the WWF and you're listening to the greatest tag team in radio,  Opie and Anthony.  We got someone not happy.  Lisa, Long Island, what's up?  Maybe we could talk this out.  Humor is in the worst taste I have ever heard.  I can't believe the choice of humor.  The worst.  You think that's funny?  Yes.  You think that's intelligent?  Make a pie, bud. 
[02:46:30]  Make a pie.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Man, during the break, we're kind of just watching the news here and some white dude  in what, Florida got his arm ripped off by an alligator?  Yeah.  Oh.  And he's proud.  Yeah, he was smiling because he was being interviewed by the media, I guess.  He was in the hospital. 
[02:47:00]  Y'all really love that shit, boy, when bad things happen to him.  Oh.  It's a badge of honor.  I've lost my eye.  Let me get...  How come he's able to interview right after he lost his arm and Vince can't give us a  little interview?  Yeah.  After a little fucking electrical thing falls on him.  I'm pretty sure my arm will never get bitten off by an alligator.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'm almost 99% sure that it's not going to happen.  What are white people doing?  You're not going to be in that position with an alligator.  I hate...  You know what?  The old hat...  You know, white people do this, black people... 
[02:47:30]  But it's just...  Black people, you don't hear that shit.  Mm-hmm.  You just don't hear about...  And then, you know, see him walking around the hospital with pictures in the news where  he's like...  He's like...  Has a smile on his face like, hey, I'm just happy to be here.  Yeah.  You're an armless asshole.  Patrice, here's the question for you.  Black guy in the hospital lost his arm to an alligator.  How would that sound?  That would not be good.  You wouldn't be laughing.  You wouldn't...  If you said it...  Okay.  Black guy walked to the hospital, lost his arm.  You go... 
[02:48:00]  Diabetes.  Diabetes first.  Gunshot wound.  Gunshot with a hollow point that tore through it, so they had to take it off and...  Yeah.  Or shotgun.  Mm-hmm.  Not in...  Pitbull.  Yeah, yeah.  Pitbull could have ripped it off.  Maybe.  No, come on.  Mm-hmm.  Pitbull tore it off.  But not...  Or a pet tiger that he illegally...  Pet tiger.  He illegally smuggled in from Timbuktu. 
[02:48:30]  From Timbuktu.  Like Tony Montana.  Yeah.  I want the tigers.  But not an animal.  And a lot of people...  Like, you know, piranhas...  Black people love piranhas.  Yeah.  Piranhas are...  They don't do what they do in B movies.  Piranhas do not skin you alive in 30 seconds.  And just see a skeleton like of a horse.  Just like you put a fucking...  A cow in there.  And then all of a sudden there's just a head and the bones of a cow.  It doesn't exist. 
[02:49:00]  Fucking...  Piranha.  I was gonna...  When I was gonna buy a fish, I went...  Of course, I went...  Piranha because I want to see him eat a meatloaf.  The fucking fish are the most boring nobodies in the history of fish.  Like, no personality.  They'll sit there.  You can put your hand in.  You can touch them.  They do nothing.  They're not like the movie Piranha.  It wasn't even movies that did it.  It was...  I think it was when we were kids.  Cartoons always portrayed piranhas as like... 
[02:49:30]  You know, you'd see one cartoon character would take piranhas and put them in the bathtub.  Yeah.  And the other one would go in and...  Wow.  Get all chewed up.  And piranhas are nobodies.  But, like, I don't understand how you get your arm bitten off by a fucking alligator.  You're where the alligator lives and where you don't live and aren't supposed to live.  I bet there's a lot of black guys, though, with arms and legs missing down there in fucking Alabama and...  From what?  Alligators?  Yeah.  Down there living in the fucking backwoods swamp motherfuckers. 
[02:50:00]  There are no, like, black...  Diabetes, we lose feet and toes, but there's no accidental arm losses.  Maybe in some shitty factory with a white boss.  It's always the white guy's fault.  Hey, listen, I need you to go fix the industrial-sized blender we have over there.  It's a human-sized blender.  Now, I'm going to turn this button.  It's going to be on and it's going to be plugged in.  Yeah, it's the fast way to clean it.  I just need you to get in there.  It takes two hours. 
[02:50:30]  We have to clean when it's off.  All right, here's what we're going to do.  We can clean it when it's on in 15 minutes.  You're going to sit on the blade with a mop.  And I'm going to turn it on.  And you're just going to spin and just...  It's going to go over really quickly.  Don't worry about it.  Yes, boss.  Anything you say.  I bet you it's very rare for a black guy to lose a limb in this type of dumb accident.  Yeah.  Like, bitten off by an animal. 
[02:51:00]  It just hasn't happened.  It's not going to be a shark attack or any of that stuff.  It could be, because shark attacks is arbitrary.  That's like, you don't have to be somewhere you don't belong with a shark attack.  But I doubt it.  Well, it's mostly surfers, though, with the shark attacks.  Surfers and Hawaiian people, because bull sharks...  Believe it or not, bull sharks are the worst.  They're animals.  They're the worst.  There's a guy and a girl on their honeymoon, and the girls out there, and they were swimming,  and the fucking shark just bit half her ass off.  Bit her fucking one ass cheek. 
[02:51:30]  Gone.  I think that needs to happen to humans from time to time, because we're so fucking cocky.  We think our lives matter, and you're just food.  Like everyone else on this goddamn planet.  You're not top of the food chain.  The second you go in the ocean, you are not the fucking boss anymore.  How long would you stay with your girl if she lost her ass cheek to a shark attack?  Her ass cheek to a shark attack?  Let me think.  She doesn't have her ass anymore.  It is just that healing hunk.  It's like, yeah, just a big bite.  A healing hunk of redness. 
[02:52:00]  It's just red and scar.  And it's concave, shaped like the letter C.  A shark bite.  Her ass now looks like somebody pulled it inside out to the front,  and she's just missing an ass cheek.  You'd have to just figure out...  All you see is muscle from the thigh, so it's one ass cheek and thigh muscle healing.  You'd have to fuck her with that ass cheek on the bed  and just look at the other ass cheek and bend her leg up a little.  How long could you stay?  You grab her ass and just... 
[02:52:30]  Oh my God, what is that one?  Is that her?  Someone's ass being eaten.  That's an eaten ass cheek.  Come on.  Is that guy alive at least?  No, that guy's got to be dead.  You wouldn't have his face in the sand like that.  Yeah, good point.  I think you'd help the motherfucker out a little more than...  But I think a woman would stay with you if you lost your ass cheek in it.  Like a woman would stay with a man if you lost your ass cheek in some type of accident.  Think about when you're fucking and you hold on to the ass like that,  and then you'd be holding on to one normal ass cheek,  and then the other one you'd be touching like a spine or a pelvis bone. 
[02:53:00]  Just prop her up against the wall and then hold the one ass cheek.  And she has to wear a prosthetic ass cheek.  Yeah, and the pants.  Her special draw.  She has to get special health insurance underwear that puts an ass cheek in.  Which makes washing clothes a nightmare because all you hear is that...  Oh, God damn.  Another guy that lost his ass.  They love eating ass, those sharks.  Is that a shark attack?  Yeah.  Got it, man.  Those are the shark attacks you never hear of. 
[02:53:30]  The guy that lost his life because his ass got eaten.  That's a leg and an ass, isn't it?  Yeah.  He got like his whole fucking leg.  Your ass got a lot of nerve in it.  Look at this.  Imus is on every fucking shot.  They just love it.  Hey, we got a lot of people that have lost their limbs out there.  Maybe we should get a few calls on the air today.  All white guys.  And diabetes doesn't count.  No, it's got to be fucking boss told me to fucking try to get the fucking peg thing out of the thing. 
[02:54:00]  And how about a black guy?  My arm went in.  Yeah.  Black guy that lost a limb.  That's the get today.  Hey, by the way, no surprise, but the WWE is hiding from our questions.  What?  They're begging to be on our show on a regular basis, and now we finally got a reason to have them on our show,  and they will not come on our show.  Well, Mr. McMahon is recuperating, I guess.  Family around him.  Yeah.  All right, we got limb stories coming up, and Motley Crue on Larry King. 
[02:54:30]  Again?  This is not a repeat.  This is the sequel to the famous Motley Crue on Larry King.  They thought it went so well the first time that they did it again.  They did it again.  They got another tour happening.  They're getting some media attention, and they went on Larry King again.  Larry King was so bad with Motley Crue the first time around.  Why would you go back on there?  He called them the Motley Crue.  Yeah.  In their first get together. 
[02:55:00]  He knows nothing about music, rock music, being a hip.  You want to hear some highlights?  Please.  All right.  Here we go.  Motley Crue on Larry King.  Oh, God.  How did the tattooing start?  Come on.  This is like, this is S&L stuff.  How did the tattooing start?  What the fuck?  How did the tattooing start? 
[02:55:30]  I mean in history, not with the band.  Right.  How did the tattooing start?  You know, so, who's based on the thing?  How did the tattooing start?  He did it.  Who did it?  I did it.  He did it.  Who was first?  Who was first?  I don't know who was first.  I'm not sure.  But we all pretty much read around.  Mr. Two.  Obi, does he even realize, and I heard that Snoop Dogg, does Steve, what's his name?  King, what's his name?  Larry King. 
[02:56:00]  Larry King.  You really don't know Larry's name?  I say Steve or Allen a lot when I think about Allen.  Okay, I gotcha.  Now, does he know that that can, putting these guys in that kind of spot with that stupid  fucking question.  Right.  Could harm their career.  Right.  When you ask some fucking so-called anti-establishment type of people, hey, when did the tattooing  start?  And you force them to go, I don't know.  Yeah, it sounds just.  Who got it first?  Who was first?  Was it me? 
[02:56:30]  Was it you?  Like, it's like.  Yeah.  It's like, I don't know.  Shut the fuck up, dude.  I got tats.  We got them at fucking different times.  You think we remember?  We were in drug-induced fucking haze, you old bat.  What kind of dumb old question is that?  And then he made Snoop Dogg try to fucking sing with him.  Oh, God.  Why would you be polite about it?  I mean, it's a dumb question.  You should kind of call him out.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  I don't know.  Like Ant said, yeah, you get a little attitude about it.  Like, I'm a rock star, dude.  I don't know.  When did the tattoo start?  Did you take Garlique to prevent infection? 
[02:57:00]  What was used, ink or Welch's grape juice?  Sorry, I think the tattooing started at the end of your fifth marriage.  Yeah.  I think that's it.  That's funny.  I think that's it.  You are quite a motley crew.  He can just damage you.  He can damage you.  I agree with you.  Let's hear the rest of this.  Around the same time, very early, like the first record, did we start getting tattooed?  Tommy wasn't even old enough to get a tattoo.  No. 
[02:57:30]  In the first record.  Not that that stopped us from doing anything.  Yeah, me and Tommy went to high school together.  I got a tad of, it says, fuck the krauts when I was in the big one.  This next clip really fast.  Kill Roy was here.  Don't they have a song called, don't they have a song called I'll fucking kill you if you ask me a question about my tattoos?  They should.  They're penning one now.  Well, speaking of which, so the guys try to move on because they realize we have nothing on tattooing and Larry just will not drop it. 
[02:58:00]  So they actually invited me in and I slept on the floor next to Tommy's bed for a long time.  Who said let's get tattooed?  Oh, God.  Did you get stewed, screwed, and tattooed?  Because I know people like doing those three things.  Floor next to Tommy's bed for a long time.  Who said let's get tattooed?  I can't remember how that started, but we were always like into tattoos, into anything that was rebellious. 
[02:58:30]  And I think in the beginning, you know, for me personally, tattoos were like, what's going on?  Not my first one.  My first one was that rose right there.  That's right.  Why is he on TV?  Why is he still on TV?  He's not relevant.  I got a tattoo of a dollar bill on my cock.  And when I get a heart, I jerk off so I can watch my money grow.  Get it? 
[02:59:00]  How important is the ink when it comes to a tattoo?  Does it matter?  We got our first one.  See?  Ryan in Florida.  Ryan?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  You don't have a foot?  Yeah.  I actually lost a foot in a gator attack.  I was fishing with one of my friends and came out of nowhere, dude.  Grabbed me by the foot.  Took me under.  Luckily, we carry guns because, you know, it's known to happen every now and then.  And my friend shot it a couple times and he let me loose. 
[02:59:30]  But they don't actually eat you alive.  They take you under and try to drown you and then eat you later after you're dead.  Yeah, because they kind of strangle you.  Don't they use that tail and everything to just kind of strangle the crap out of you?  No, they just take you down underwater and drown you.  Right, but they hold you, like, with their tail.  Not their tail, their teeth.  They don't need anything with their fucking teeth.  They don't need anything else, you don't think?  They go on that death roll thing where they grab you and spin you around and just rip you to pieces.  Why did the guy hang up?  I want to hear about...  Yeah, what happened after he bit him and how did he get to the hospital? 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  How clean must...  That's got to be the dirtiest, most jagged fucking injury you can have is some alligator tooth bite.  You know that's not like a nice, clean fucking meat slicer cut.  Tearing it.  Yeah.  We got our first one.  We'll get more.  That must hurt.  Yeah.  You think?  Back to Motley Crue on Larry King.  Ah, tattoos.  Larry asks, is their tunes... 
[03:00:30]  If their tunes are hummable.  What?  This is unbelievable.  What?  This is a joke, right?  I think Motley Crue's more of a joke for just, like, going with it.  I'd be like, shut up.  Yeah, what?  Hummable.  These are dumb questions.  Are your tunes hummable?  Oh, yeah.  Can people leave a concert and sing a Motley Crue song?  That's kind of one of the things that we always pride ourselves on.  You know, you've got to have those melodies that, you know, you leave the concert going, you know, singing, girls, girls, girls. 
[03:01:00]  Or Dr. Phil, you know, don't go away, Matt, or, you know, the new stuff, you know, it's all about me.  He interviewed Jerry Seinfeld yesterday.  I didn't watch it, but I guess he...  Oh, I saw that.  I know where you got that.  I mean...  Jerry basically is like, you're an idiot. 
[03:01:30]  You're an idiot.  He really did.  He called them out.  We did the audio on the show.  You're an in.  Go ahead.  No, you did the audio already?  Is this a new interview?  No, they did.  For the Beat movie?  No, not for the Beat movie.  For Carlin.  He was...  I think he interviewed...  I didn't see...  Oh, last night for George Carlin.  Okay.  He interviewed Jerry Seinfeld for...  It was a memorial for Carlin.  Okay, no, I didn't see that.  So I know he had to have dumb questions, you know what I mean?  Well, let's find out.  Because we can't get enough of Larry King's interviewing, you know, technique. 
[03:02:00]  Could your songs be played on an elevator?  Question.  It's hard to hum.  Dr. Feelgood.  Yeah.  These songs are un-hummable.  The Motley Crue.  Where can I get your new EP? 
[03:02:30]  Isn't every song hummable, really?  Think about it.  Mmm.  Get something going for every song.  All right.  Does Dr. Feelgood take Medicaid?  Oh, this is wonderful.  Kick-start my ha-heart.  I'm not singing.  I'm telling somebody.  Please.  Help me. 
[03:03:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Who's top of the food chain when it comes to fucking groupies?  Now, that would have been a good question.  Yeah, Larry wouldn't ask that one.  Who gets the most pussy would have been a really good question.  Yeah.  How long does it take for the tattoo to heal?  Tommy Lee, your cock is huge.  Not a question, just a comment. 
[03:03:30]  Can you write Mississippi on your cock?  Mike in Hudson Valley's got an alligator effect.  We're doing two things here.  Oh.  Go ahead, Mike.  Listen to this.  What's up, little boy?  Hey, man.  Hey, Mikey.  Yeah, I was going to say, Anthony was exactly right about the alligators taking you under,  doing the death roll to kill you, and they actually won't even eat too much of you right  away, but they'll defend your corpse, and they'll stay next to you for a couple days until  you start to rot.  Then all your tissues and your joints get a lot softer, and then they'll just slowly eat 
[03:04:00]  you over the corpse.  Slowly roll.  Nice.  Well, that's a horrific.  Way to go.  That's wonderful to defend your corpse after they're the ones that kill you.  Watch out, guys.  All right, and then we got someone that lost a fist.  Matt, Jersey.  A fist?  What's going on, guys?  As opposed to a hand?  Yeah, wait.  It's just a hand.  I like that he said a fist.  A couple years ago with a snowplow in his driveway, and I was at work, and I came home,  and there's fucking ambulances and fucking cops everywhere, and I look, and I guess it  got fucking stuck with snow, and he stuck his fist in there to try to get it, like,  undone or whatever, and that thing tore his fucking wrist right off. 
[03:04:30]  Oh.  God.  And I was like, you are such a fucking idiot.  Oh, that's what he wants to hear.  Yeah, I know, right?  You dumb motherfucker.  You lost your hand.  Boy, you stupid.  Dummy.  Right.  That's not what he wants to hear.  Turn the fucking thing off.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go.  I knew some guy that worked in this supermarket, and they were making chop meat, and he was  pushing the thing through, and the chop meat machine grabbed his arm, his hand, and 
[03:05:00]  his arm, and ripped the skin from the elbow down to his wrist.  Like, there was just the bone.  It's all set.  You're just there with everything folded down like a cuff.  Like, you just kind of rolled up your sleeve, but...  What's your imaginary, like, something that you go, oh, man, this is...  Horrible?  But your imaginary losing a...  Mine, I got two, which is the escalator getting caught, your pants getting caught.  Oh, right. 
[03:05:30]  Okay.  Getting caught in the part of the escalator that when you're up there.  Yeah, yeah.  And it goes back into the machinery.  And for some reason, I have something long on, and I'm shredding paper.  I do a lot of shredding.  Yeah, I shred.  And then just something happens with the shredder.  Sometimes I clean the shredder out, and I don't unplug it.  Oh, that's stupid.  And I'm just like, something...  You got it.  Unplug it.  I think about losing a finger in a shredder.  I had this...  A paper shredder.  It wasn't something like losing a limb or anything, but it was something horrible that  I used to think about when I was in Woodshop. 
[03:06:00]  It was running a board through the table saw.  Oh, yeah.  And slipping and just, bam, hitting your chin on the fucking blade as it's spinning.  Because you know why?  It wouldn't go...  It would make like a bang like you were punched.  Yeah.  But it would leave a fucking, like, cut all the way through your teeth.  But falling, like, chin first as you're sliding the wood through on a table saw. 
[03:06:30]  I scared the shit out of me.  Alligator guy called back because we need the rest of the story.  So, alligator guy.  So, now you come back out of the water, and you realize that the alligator took your foot.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, well, what happened is, you know, it took me under.  The guy shot it a couple times, and it was actually so bad, you know, it didn't bite  the foot completely off.  But there was, like, bones sticking out and everything.  My friend passed out.  He couldn't even handle it.  They took me to the doctor. 
[03:07:00]  They tried to save it, but it was just so bad.  They had to amputate it.  So, I was just going to feed you in with the rest of the story, fellas.  I'll probably just look like a big blob of shit on the end of your fucking leg.  So, why can't they put just, like, a little bit of, like, you know, the alcohol or the  paroxi, right?  Yeah.  And then wrap it up and see what happens.  Wrap it up.  Like, I'll take a mauled foot.  Over no foot.  Over no foot.  Or just have, they should have, like, metal molds of feet and hands. 
[03:07:30]  So, when it's all fucked up, you just slap a mold on there and let it heal.  And then take the mold off, and you just have, like, fingers.  I saw a guy walking down Columbus Avenue with the fake leg.  They got the fake leg figured out.  Well, they got the good one.  It's ugly, though.  It's a bouncy spatula.  Spatula foot.  No, that's if you want to be an athlete.  Yeah, but people use that bouncy spatula foot.  That's the attachment if you want to be an athlete.  No, that's the spatula foot.  But that's, like, the good one.  Definitely, that's the foot. 
[03:08:00]  It's the good one, but you've got to look silly.  But they got the knee figured out and everything, where it bends, where it's supposed to bend, and everything.  I saw this guy walking down Columbus Avenue.  If you didn't know any better, you wouldn't see the...  He was in shorts?  He was in shorts.  He's ballsy.  He barely had a lip.  It's selfish.  Yeah, it is selfish.  The knee was moving how it was supposed to move.  Yeah.  They got banged.  It's like an adjustment.  Did he have a spatula?  That's very funny, man.  Spatula foot.  Hey, or toes.  Oh, rudder foot. 
[03:08:30]  Hey, rudder foot.  Hey, oh, rudder foot.  Now we go back over here to Motley Crue and Larry Kemp.  Motley Crue.  Girls, or Dr. Field, don't go way mad, or even with the new stuff, you know.  It's always been something that we, you know, always make sure that's real.  It's not just sounds, am I?  It's not just...  We're not...  Not just sounds?  What an idiot.  Did he just say not just sounds?  What an idiot.  So it's not just sounds, it's music? 
[03:09:00]  What do you make?  Jesus, this guy's a fucking tool.  You would think he would get, like, somebody to give him a few Motley Crue songs.  Very catchy songs, if you listen to the hits especially.  Oh, I love the rock and roll.  God, what an idiot.  He doesn't know anything about him.  He doesn't even do the basics for his interview.  Yeah.  All right, then he continues.  Good.  Good old Larry.  Come on.  Maybe he doesn't care.  Meh. 
[03:09:30]  Fix it.  You said that this set, our set, which has been around for a long time, is a lot like  your set on tour?  Yeah.  I mean, I don't want to give away too much what our set looks like, but...  It's exactly it.  It says CNN.  Yeah, exactly.  How important to the rock band is that?  There's the famous one.  How important.  We learned a while ago that he always asked the how important is the blank to the blank.  And he actually asked a snowboarder one day, was it? 
[03:10:00]  No, it was the skateboarder.  A skateboarder, right.  Remember the video of the skateboarder, Patrice?  He fell like 50 feet.  He was on a half pipe, one of those ridiculously huge half pipes.  He was trying to move and he ended up falling to earth like 30 or 40 feet.  Yeah.  Larry King was talking to him.  And he actually asked him, how important is the skateboard?  In like fucking skateboarding.  Skateboarding?  Yeah.  How important is the skateboard?  Pretty fucking important, dummy. 
[03:10:30]  How important is your microphone?  How important to the rock band is that?  For us, what happens is we kind of created a monster back in the early 80s when we first started out.  Frankenstein?  You know, we started out lighting ourselves on fire and trying to beat ourselves every single tour.  And then, you know, now we've kind of like, oh, now what do we have to do to top our last tour?  Unbelievable.  So what are you going to do?  This is pathetic. 
[03:11:00]  It's really a detriment to their career.  It is.  To hear these guys talking like this.  I agree with you.  You shouldn't be going with this.  You should be like kind of mocking them.  Like, are you serious?  Are you serious?  What do you think?  Do you know any of our songs, you asshole?  We have a King Cam question about a famous or maybe should I say notorious aspect of past Motley Crue shows.  Watch.  Hey, Lewis, this is Steve Mason.  Do you think that same-sex marriages will be accepted nationwide now that they've been accepted in California? 
[03:11:30]  That's a good question.  It should be.  I'm sorry.  That was wrong.  That was for Lewis Black.  Wrong question.  Wrong time.  Oh, God.  Is he a complete disaster?  How important is the real clip?  This is in college radio.  Oh, God.  He just re-signed with him?  He did, right?  Well, that's good for us.  We can't get enough of him and his dumb technique.  Let's see.  Girl lost arm in shop class. 
[03:12:00]  Friend lost finger in warehouse.  Uncle lost arm in saw accident.  Which one do you want to go to?  Saw.  Yeah?  The girl.  Let's go to Steve in the Pocono State.  When did your crew become motley?  Dog shit sniffer.  Steve, let's go.  Hey.  Buddy.  Uncle lost arm.  Steve.  Poconos.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Let's go to Wade in Toronto.  Wade?  What's my deal, Wade? 
[03:12:30]  Good, buddy.  Back at about 16 years old and sitting in shop class, there's a girl painting wood that's  an inch and a half thick, and me and the teacher over in one corner, she's kind of in another,  and all of a sudden you hear this wicked shrill, and you know something's wrong, and her arm  is stuck in the planer, up almost to the elbow.  Oh, the planer.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  It just ripped the top of her arm off?  Yeah, and the shavings come out the back. 
[03:13:00]  Well, there was no shavings, man.  It was just red, and now she's got a little stump at the elbow, and when she pulled, when  he finally got the machine turned off, pulled her arm out, there was like still about four  inches of bone up to the elbow.  It was gross, and the shop teacher quit.  He retired.  He couldn't take it.  All right.  I'm playing with him.  They took a lot of chances in high school with that shop crap.  Yeah, what the fuck are they thinking?  They really did.  Yeah, let's just have whirling blades and throw children at it.  There you go, kids.  Grab this shit and put it into the whirling blades. 
[03:13:30]  You know, kids that have a problem listening to anything, you can't trust them with this  equipment.  You can't trust them with a pen.  Right.  Like they're throwing pens at each other and shit.  They don't have shop class anymore?  Oh, I'm sure they don't.  I haven't been to a school in quite some time.  But yeah, the fucking, what about the lathe?  That could be one of the most dangerous fucking things.  And you went in there.  These are machines that like professional people should be using.  And you go in there and some dumb ass is trying to teach you how to use it. 
[03:14:00]  He doesn't even know.  And that lathe thing used to scare me because you'd get that kickback on the blade if you  didn't hold it tight enough.  You'd have to hold that fucker down.  I hated the lathe.  I always thought it was going to flip the back of the tool up and smash me.  I never used that equipment, obviously.  I have nothing to add here.  Horrible.  Bandsaw.  Yeah.  You never push into the blade.  You're always supposed to keep your hands on either side of the blade.  And when you're cutting a circular thing, you got to keep moving your hands. 
[03:14:30]  I didn't do that once and just kept going around.  And it went through the wood really fast.  And my thumb just went, bah, touched the blade.  It, fuck, I almost fainted right there.  I was like, oh my God.  You know, the first thing you do is grab whatever's injured and then take the slow look at it.  Yeah.  You got to go, all right, let me, oh, that's a good one.  How bad was it?  It was pretty bad.  It cut right through my thumb.  No, because it was on the tip of my thumb, so I just kind of wrapped it in tape. 
[03:15:00]  All right.  We're going to take another break.  I hate those things.  Ugh.  Machines.  After the live show today, we're going to replay our last interview with George Carlin.  Going to go to break with another piece.  This is pertinent.  Censorship.  Disgust with people in general.  George Carlin from our show a few months back.  People think they have a right to not have their feelings hurt.  I know.  They actually think that's a given right that the forefathers wrote in that said, your 
[03:15:30]  feelings, they can't be hurt.  Right.  And that is, you could say whatever you want as far as hurting someone's feelings.  That's that left-wing paternalism.  Big white daddy.  Oh, yeah.  Big white daddy knows best.  Yep.  That came, you know, everyone, we all got to understand that we could expect censorship  from the right wing.  Over time, we know that's where it's going to come from.  But to expect it from the left wing, from the politically correct people in the campuses,  especially the Eastern Ivy League campuses, that caught me by surprise. 
[03:16:00]  The conservatives have always hid behind, like, family values and religion.  And it seems like what the liberals hide behind is things like hate speech.  Like, that's how they get you to kind of not say what kind of snatches their ideology.  Yeah, it's, this country went off the cliff and it's just in free fall now.  It's just, you know, we're waiting for the Big Bang to happen.  And it's so wonderful what nature is doing to smack us back.  This arrogant species who overbuilds, overreaches, overuses, wastes, just completely lays waste 
[03:16:30]  and despoils everything it touches.  Three-wheel vehicles, all-terrain vehicles.  We're going to go everywhere there's some sand.  We're going to make a mark and we're going to make an ugly mark.  And then we're going to not worry about it.  And we're going to come home and we're going to barbecue.  You know, it's just a sick, sick, it's disgust in my voice you're hearing.  We're going to make an ugly mark. 
[03:17:00]  That was my version of linger longer. 
[03:17:30]  It's down to linger longer.  Sometimes it's just...  I got to linger longer.  Linger very long.  Opie and Anthony!  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Patrice is out cold. 
[03:18:00]  His lips are moving.  And he's talking in his sleep.  What's he saying? 
[03:18:30]  I just hear him snoring a little bit.  He's getting ready to really start snoring, I'm thinking.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  What kind of shithead falls asleep on the radio?  Oh, yeah.  Hold on a minute. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, the snoring's getting better.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's documented.  You're right, it is getting louder.  Yeah.  If we wait another minute, I think it's going to be all out snoring.  Yeah.  Because he's on his back, it's perfect.  Yeah.  Yes, hey.  Okay, okay.  Told you. 
[03:19:30]  Okay.  He's out cold.  It's getting good.  I could listen to this for 20 minutes, no problem.  Oh, yeah.  We could do like a lot of the day and just like leave him here.  Or we could yell something really racist. 
[03:20:00]  See how he reacts.  That's crazy.  What?  That's crazy.  Oh, the camera's broken.  Do whatever really loud noise we can play.  What are you doing? 
[03:20:30]  Why does he have to be in here now?  I don't know.  No, no, no.  Don't worry about it.  Oh, wait.  You just moved his head a little bit.  What kind of loud noise do you want to like?  Steven S. from Bayshore writes,  Mighty Snore Yuff.  Hold on, hold on. 
[03:21:00]  Hey, how you doing?  He's awake.  Holy shit.  I was in deep rim, man.  I'm sorry about that.  That's hysterical.  He just put the mic up to you and you're like...  What woke you up, man?  You heard us talking?  I'm just...  I'm always aware of white meetings.  How are you that funny right after you wake up? 
[03:21:30]  I hate you.  Fuck.  Sorry about that.  I think I was dreaming, too, man.  I was dreaming.  Wow, man.  My fault, dude.  What were you dreaming?  I don't even know.  I was unprofessional.  God damn it.  I'm sorry.  I've done it.  You're not the first, Patrice.  Yeah.  The show blows the hell out of everybody.  Someone suggested play a loud police siren.  That should wake them up. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, wow.  You all right?  Yeah, sorry about that.  You slept right through the break and everything.  I walked past you twice.  Sorry.  I was snoring?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  It was a good one.  Well, start off just a heavy breathing and then you got to...  Up goes.  Up goes.  I have a feeling this is going to turn into some heavy snoring.  And then you started...  A little more.  Almost on cue.  No fat snorer.  Jesus.  Well, you're on your back, too. 
[03:22:30]  It's perfect.  I did that once and they fucking put the mic on me, put the PalTalk camera on me and left  the fucking studio.  And they just left me there with some fucking lullaby music gently playing in the background.  Are you serious?  And I woke up just like, oh, my God.  The show's over.  Where the fuck am I?  I had no idea where I was.  Somebody could help us out, but I think Ant was out for easily a half hour.  Oh, yeah.  Nobody.  He just knocked out.  Oh, I was just fucking tired.  Just him breathing and snoring for a half hour is all you heard on this channel. 
[03:23:00]  Then he woke up.  Jesus, that quick fucking sleep revitalized me just now.  I was just like, oh, shit.  You ready to roll?  Yeah.  Let's do it.  We got to do it in...  We got to take shifts.  Yeah.  Just fucking three minutes each.  That's four in the morning.  God damn it.  Tell me about it.  It sucks.  All right.  We could do one more thing, and we're going to get out of here on time today because we're  going to replay our George Carlin interview right around 11 or so. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  We got George Takai and his partner talking about their marriage.  Yes, I'd like to hear that.  We got a teen diving out of the speeding car to escape a sex offender.  We never got that story on the air.  Dove out on her face.  We got a kid fighting with his mom on Dr. Phil, which is really funny.  Oh, I like that.  This is like cleanup stuff over here.  And then we got the Oprah audience going absolutely insane because she was giving away all sorts  of shit.  Her spring...  Oprah's favorite things for spring thing she does every year. 
[03:24:00]  You want to go with George Takai?  I like George Takai.  All right.  Let's go with George Takai.  Or is it George Takai?  I like to say Takai.  George the Gay.  That's what I like to call myself.  George the Gay with my new husband.  And I'm a sloppy party bottom.  That's me.  Yes.  Here we go.  Gentlemen, good morning and congratulations.  Thank you very much and good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  It sounds just like Anthony when Anthony does George the Gay. 
[03:24:30]  Please, set phaser to ass sex.  Thank you.  I swear to God, I thought that was you.  Good morning.  Yes.  I can almost do it.  I love boners.  I love big boners.  Beam a double-dong dildo into our ass, please.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  George the Gay.  Oh, shit.  Gentlemen, good morning and congratulations.  Thank you very much and good morning.  Good morning. 
[03:25:00]  So when is the big day, George?  Well, tomorrow's the big day when we get our license at long last.  No wedding date yet, George?  Oh, we have a date, but it's going to be in September.  And we want...  You know, it's funny because he's the name in the relationship.  Yeah.  All questions to him, but they have no idea that he's probably like the bottom.  Yeah, he's the bottom.  The other guy's the man and he's like, you know, you're taking the spotlight.  Right.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah, George?  Oh, we have a date, but it's going to be in September. 
[03:25:30]  And we wanted to give ourselves some months to go through the...  For our asses to heal.  ...planning for it.  It takes a lot of work to plan for a wedding, Julie.  A lot of work.  Tell me about it, okay?  Tell me about it.  She doesn't want to acknowledge the fact that this is two men.  Right.  Oh, I understand.  You got to get the dress and the thing.  Oh, that's right.  Right.  I'm going to wear a lovely dress that that green woman wore in the episode where Kirk fucks 
[03:26:00]  the green woman.  She's dressed in sort of a Jolly Green Giant clothe thing I really took a liking to.  Ask him if he ever licked Scotty's asshole.  Yes.  Yes.  He's a little gamey.  I like when my boyfriend fucks my ass like the turbo lift.  Now, did Lynn and Nimoy have any reaction when you finger popped him?  He ear fucked me.  Was it no reaction, just like a Vulcan? 
[03:26:30]  He's just like a Vulcan.  What he would do is do that live long and prosper thing with his fingers, but one was  in my stink and the other one was jiggling my balls.  Wonderful.  He sounds like, George Takei sounds like Steve.  George Takei.  Here's another clip.  Yes.  So, Brad, I understand you are the one who proposed to George.  Tell me when you did it and how did you do it?  Oh, God.  Yes. 
[03:27:00]  He got down on two knees.  That's a good one, God damn it.  Son of a bitch.  He got down on both knees.  Both knees.  And I gave him the cock ring.  I couldn't say no.  Didn't have to use my hands.  I couldn't say no and he couldn't say anything.  I said, will you?  And he popped right in my mouth.  You did it.  Well, actually, George was watching TV and the news flash came on and I dropped to my 
[03:27:30]  knees and I said, George, will you marry me?  And George said, darn it.  You beat me to it.  I was going to ask you if I wasn't so preoccupied and had a cock in my mouth.  My boyfriend's ass needs to be shaved.  It looks like a tribble.  George Takei. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  You beat me to it.  You beat me to it.  You were going to do the same to Brad.  Yeah.  I had my mouth full of sandwich then.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  Dude, in that short little time, if you could see that, me and Opie just quickly looked at  each other like, what is he going to say?  You got the bleep?  Oh, where's the bleep?  Hold on.  We need to.  Hold on.  Let's make this a little different than it's supposed to be.  Let's all try to talk on George Takei. 
[03:28:30]  A mouth full of...  Okay.  Let's hear what it says.  And George said, darn it.  You beat me to it.  I meant it.  You were going to do the same to Brad.  Yeah.  I had my mouth full of...  Oh, what's wrong with you?  Your timing sucks today.  I forgot if you went to...  To Brad.  Yeah.  I had my mouth full of sandwich.  No, no.  Your timing was off. 
[03:29:00]  Damn it.  Let's see what happens when you take a day off.  You get a little rusty.  I do the same to Brad.  Yeah.  I had my mouth full of...  Oh, forget it.  We stink.  Yes.  You were going to do the same to Brad.  Yeah.  I had my mouth full of...  All right.  I don't know.  Now we need to do this right.  Okay.  Here it is.  I'm going to hit the beep right in the middle of his...  I'll nod when I'm pushing pause. 
[03:29:30]  Okay.  Watch how good this works now.  You were going to do the same to Brad.  Yeah.  I had my mouth full of...  Right.  Success.  Three times.  It's all in the timing.  Yes.  I had my mouth full of sandwich then, so I couldn't quite do it then.  Cock sandwich.  Mouth full of sandwich.  Mouth full of sandwich and pubic hair. 
[03:30:00]  Ass hairs.  Yes.  Wonderful.  But...  George Gutierrez is the funniest to see on point of the...  George the cat.  George the cat.  Yes.  Thanks.  Well, here's the next one.  Now, the two of you have been in a committed relationship with each other for 21 years.  Why is it important now to call it marriage?  Well, because it is a marriage.  You know, they can find other names for it, but...  Homosexuality.  Well, yeah.  Faggala. 
[03:30:30]  Cocksucker.  Oh, Jesus.  Plenty of names.  You can find other names for it, but...  Separate but equal.  It just doesn't...  Doesn't cut it.  Yeah, I don't want to be domestically partnered to George Takei.  I want to be married to George Takei.  And beginning today in California, I can legally marry George Takei.  I'm the happiest guy in California today, because I get to marry George.  Well, I'm the second happiest man.  I think there's happier men in California. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah.  I'm the second happiest, which means I am the bottom.  Ouch.  He's happy because he's coming.  I'm the second happiest because my asshole is tearing.  Oh, Jesus.  One more clip.  I have to go to sickbay.  Dr. McCoy, could you put an extra stitch in it to make my boyfriend even happier? 
[03:31:30]  That's the door.  That's what it sounds like when I pass wind now.  There's no resistance left for any sound.  I kept it.  George, to us, it's about love, you know?  But it's the climate we're going into that makes it political.  But for us, it's love.  And we get to make it a marriage.  That's right.  George Takei, Brad Altman, thank you, and best wishes.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[03:32:00]  You're welcome.  Thank you.  To legally suck cock is so important to me and my beau.  It's your apology.  And he calls his video Don Imus, racial profiling like always.  And on the Spores blog, The Bleacher Report, someone posted this comment.  Mr. Imus, you've had a nice long career, but it may be time to hang it up.  You simply can't come on and broadcast to the world your racist and degrading thoughts towards other people.  I think even Howard Stern is embarrassed for you right now.  The person doesn't know anything. 
[03:32:30]  Veronica, any support for Don Imus out there?  Well, there is.  You know, blogger Stephen Kaus from the Huffington Post is an Imus fan.  He says that it is Imus who is being profiled.  He writes, any fair-minded person listening to the exchange with Warner Wolfe must conclude that what Imus meant was that he was arrested  because he was black, not that he committed bad deeds because he was black.  The exact opposite of the name implied by those desperate to do Imus in and deprive me of my morning entertainment.  Imus is being profiled. 
[03:33:00]  And then Mitch Gatewood has a positive take on the situation.  He posted this comment to a Dallas Cowboys blog.  He says, as a man of color, I find Imus, his remark, disgraceful, yet important.  You see, we as a nation need people like Imus to remind us all that racism and sexism and any other ism still exist.  We need to be reminded so that we can confront it.  Patrice O'Neill, New York, New York.  So, Tony, we are asking you now, how do you out there feel about this issue?  Go ahead and let us know.  Would you fuck her?  Send us an iReport. 
[03:33:30]  All you have to do is log on to iReport.com.  Bit of Asian.  She's got some other thing in her.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Your boy Imus, man.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Gives a shit.  Poor guy.  What the fuck?  Black people aren't racist.  Leave him alone.  We can't be.  No, of course.  Racist means you need power in order to use your races.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I'm very prejudiced.  Yeah.  I prejudge.  Oh, do I ever prejudge? 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  Even after I know the truth, I continue to prejudge.  Use your prejudgment.  Fuck the truth.  After I prejudge and it's wrong, it's still the same exact thing I thought it was.  Oh, shit.  Which makes it racism.  Yeah.  Let's do line of the day and get the hell out of here.  We'll replay the George Carlin interview the last time you stopped by and hung with us,  which is kind of sad.  It's kind of weird to hear now.  Yeah.  Well, well.  We have to do, like, a show that features just all the people that have died. 
[03:34:30]  Dead people show.  That we've talked to over the years.  Give me a little time.  Creepy.  Sure I'll be in a robe and slippers, sipping broth with my new boy.  My new beau.  Petting my little poodle.  I hope it doesn't look like the one that beamed up when the transporter malfunctioned.  Remember two Kirks?  My favorite episode was when Captain Kirk and the woman switched bodies. 
[03:35:00]  He was acting like the woman.  Can't come up.  There you go.  I know.  I'm just racking my mind.  Matt Lamb makes a great point from New York City.  He writes, so reading blogs is now the news.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're just reading blogs.  The news has gotten so lazy that they just read blogs now.  Yes.  I don't like blogs.  I like logs.  You beat me to it. 
[03:35:30]  Suck that cock.  Where are you going to go on your honeymoon there, Mr. Takai?  Probably somewhere nice like San Francisco or another f***ing city.  I could say the old gag.  We're taking the ship to Uranus.  I get it.  That's space talk for asshole.  We could do that, but I want to roll. 
[03:36:00]  Yes.  Line of the day is sponsored by Carbonite.com.  Carbonite backs up your computer hard drive so you never have to worry about losing any of your files.  Check it out at Carbonite.com.  Promo code XM.  Here's your first runner-up line of the day.  Oh, this is wonderful.  Kickstart my ha-heart.  I'm not singing.  I'm telling somebody, please.  Help me. 
[03:36:30]  Seemed like that just happened.  Yeah.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Yeah.  Trying to desperately hold on to regular guy-ness.  He gets paid well.  You took a right turn on better than you, Street.  Patrice O'Neal.  Houston Improv next weekend.  July 4th weekend.  Yeah.  PatriceO'Neal.com. 
[03:37:00]  Thank you.  I've been watching some of your video blogs.  You have a make-out session with your chick.  Who?  Yeah.  Oh, Patrice O'Neal for president.  Yeah.  And she's like all up in your stuff.  Yeah.  You guys are doing some of that.  Yeah.  Lucky me.  You guys are doing some of that out-of-mouth making out.  With her big ass.  Both tongues are just out and about.  Just way bigger than Anthony likes.  With my fat out-of-shape girl. 
[03:37:30]  With her big negro butt.  I saw her comic.  She's looking good, yo.  She does look good.  She's looking real good.  But not racial standards.  She doesn't meet up to my lily white standards.  You should have saw the black girls in Patrice's audience, man.  There was a lot of lookers.  A lot of lookers.  Is that what they're calling them these days? 
[03:38:00]  What did I say?  I'm sorry.  I'm not really into the nigglets.  I'm sorry I slipped that.  I'm sorry I slipped that.  Anthony does not like nigglets.  No, I do.  Really do.  They should only come racing a Nazi and beating him in a race in 1941.  The final runner-up line of the day, I believe, right?  Let's do it.  I'm shaking my head.  No, then you can absolutely call me gay.  Here's a dude code here. 
[03:38:30]  Ready?  Yeah.  I would pillow smother my girl for that.  That was really funny.  But when you mentioned, like, go to a museum to get some kind of glass thing so you can  put her in it and roll around like an exhibit, that had me rolling.  Goddamn, Patrice.  She is every, she is any, anybody can bring her anywhere to any, any racial bounds.  Her fucking beauty is boundless. 
[03:39:00]  Well, I said the homie barbecue.  Absolutely.  I know you guys have homie barbecues where Whitey's not really invited.  Back in the day, but white people have infiltrated everything.  We say the same thing.  Not even covert no more.  You don't even put on blackface.  You just come in as a white guy and go, hello.  And we go, okay.  Somebody's friend is white.  I'm happy to say that Patrice will be with us tomorrow again.  Two days with Patrice.  I like that.  Yes.  So we'll see you tomorrow, Patrice.  Here is your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day. 
[03:39:30]  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  What woke you up, man?  You heard us talking?  Oh, I'm just, I'm always aware of white meetings.  You're out of business now, buddy.  Fucking Patrice gets line of the day seconds after he wakes up from a really, and I mean 
[03:40:00]  deep sleep.  Fuck you.  God damn, it was that good.  By the way, when I said she was looking good, yo, I was fucking, you know.  Yo?  I wasn't trying to sound cool.  Was you trying to have black friends, though?  Oh, come on.  Some of your best friends are black?  Yeah, that's always a good one.  I was just trying to.  Watch some of my closest friends are black. 
[03:40:30]  Just fucking around a little bit.  Is the producer of this show black?  No, we have you.  You don't even have a black intern.  Boy, you guys are racist.  Dude, we have you in every once in a while.  What am I doing here?  I'm really, you know what I am?  I'm a token Negro.  You're the token that allows us to say what we have to say.  We'd have gotten in so much trouble today if you weren't here.  The smartest thing Howard ever did was hiring Robin so he could go down that road.  It's a shame.  You know? 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  A lot of shows hire women so they could do the female bashing shit.  And then women can go like, oh, stop, guys.  But I try very hard to be honest.  I wish I could just say, you know, I would love to just kind of, you know what?  My job is, I'm going to get y'all fired.  Yeah?  I'm going to cry one day just on the air when I say something.  Oh, shit.  How funny about that, baby?  Oh, my God.  Please do that.  I'm going to march out of here.  I'm willing to take that chance.  No one would even believe it.  I'm going to march out of here and go, fuck you guys. 
[03:41:30]  Fuck you guys.  Let me see if anything really bothered me.  I mean, Eastside Dave with things in his ass, like shit everywhere.  Yeah, yeah.  I could tell that bothers you a lot.  Yeah.  It's just like, ah, enough.  That's like, all right.  You're saying that's white boy fun?  Oh, shit.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  There's shit.  Shitty fingers?  There have been a few things we've done on this show in front of you, and I could tell  it's just white boy fun.  Like, you don't want to be any part of it.  It's just...  Mostly Eastside Dave stuff. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah, it's just shit.  Things in your ass and shit.  Like, Norton likes to play gay, but it's funny when he touches you softly and it's creepy  with those wormy hands.  It's not fun.  It's awkward for everybody.  But that shitty thing is, like, enough.  Yeah.  But racial stuff doesn't bother me that much, because I'm the biggest racist I know.  Yeah.  I wish white people weren't my least favorite people, but they're not.  See, I said it a while ago.  If you and Ant were the same color, you would be the best of friends, my... 
[03:42:30]  You think?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Very similar, just different colors.  Like, I saw Anthony with no shirt on.  I can't get past that.  Just on a racial level.  On a picture.  Do you shave the top half of your chest or something?  No.  No.  I just wonder.  You know what?  Anthony's body looks like?  Oh, where are they now?  Of somebody who used to be in shape?  Like, you look like a child star grown up.  What the fuck is that, dude?  You got a child star grown up chest.  I just...  I'll tell you. 
[03:43:00]  The best friend from one of the years.  That's what you look like.  What the fuck?  And we didn't see him for years.  That's what he looks like now.  Holy shit.  It's a little awful chest.  You know what's weird?  Ann and I have been working together like 14 years, and I realized today, and this is  a good thing, today was the first day I saw a picture of you without a shirt on.  No, Turks and Caicos.  I don't remember, man.  No, I think you were walking around in a shirt the whole time. 
[03:43:30]  No, no.  You don't think?  Nah, positive.  I know Turks.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Anthony's chest...  Oh, shit.  It just looks like...  Like what?  Yeah, it's just a nice...  You ever see uncooked duck breast?  Uncooked duck breast?  What the fuck?  Anthony's chest looks like it could give you a salmonella.  What are you talking about?  I have a little bit of sunburn, and I'm fucking not that... 
[03:44:00]  Oh, just awful little bird chest.  It really was whatever.  I didn't really...  It was just whatever.  What's that?  Oh, God.  It's helpless.  Yeah, it just was like...  You just...  You know...  Uh-oh, what happened now?  A lot of black people on the news today.  I like that.  Yeah, it really is.  They'll call.  Maybe Sean Hannity will call me.  Sean has ostracized me from his...  I know.  You got that other guy.  This guy looks angry.  It's only on the new... 
[03:44:30]  He left...  He quit TV.  He's just doing radio.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he's gone.  All right.  Why don't we get out of here?  All right, let's go.  Patrice will be in tomorrow.  Yeah, thanks a lot, man.  We'll continue this racial tension tomorrow.  See?  See what happens?  He's already gone.  See?  Are we going to have a little small talk after today's show?  A little bit?  I'm going to try it.  She's leaving.  We're going to try it, right?  I can't promise.  All right.  There goes Patrice.  Door slamming.  I want to thank the people that showed up on the bleachers today. 
[03:45:00]  Small crowd.  You never know.  Some days big crowd, some days small crowd.  Today small crowd.  Small crowd.  See you tomorrow. </pre>
