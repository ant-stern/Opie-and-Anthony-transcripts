<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a defiant assertion of their right to be provocative and offensive.  They immediately launched into a discussion of a tased airport passenger, speculating on his mental state and possible language barrier, before transitioning into a graphic recounting of their smoking experiences, including anecdotes from airplanes and airport smoking rooms.  This sparked a caller segment featuring stories about smoking, difficult childhoods, and unusual medical situations, including one caller describing a person smoking through a hole in their throat, another detailing triacid in cigarettes, and a hospital employee recounting an "ambiguous birth."  The hosts’ commentary was consistently laced with crude language and sexually suggestive humor.  The discussion then shifted to Oscar De La Hoya's underwear fetish and the ensuing lawsuit, fueled by explicit photos.  They also covered Barry Bonds' perjury indictment, again with vulgar jokes and crude humor.  The show concluded the first major segment with the "FU line," caller-submitted angry messages, an upcoming contest announcement, and the impending arrival of guests Joe Rogan and Ari Shaffir.  One host's bad hair day, blamed on his girlfriend's hair products, and a brief recounting of him wearing women's underwear further fueled the vulgar commentary.

The next segment opened with a discussion of the popular in-house “Ow” sound effect and listener-submitted remixes by CokeLogic, Than and Danny, and Cradle of Milf.  The hosts then tackled a recent frustrating political debate, focusing on candidates' evasive answers regarding driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants, playing audio clips of these responses and contrasting them with Obama's direct "yes" and Clinton’s eventual "no" after Spitzer’s withdrawal of support.  They heavily criticized Hillary Clinton and Dennis Kucinich using derogatory terms.  A humorous element was their imitation of Clinton's voice as “ak-ak-ak.”  The segment previewed an upcoming "Dumb-Off" competition featuring Rich Voss, Robert Kelly, and Francine, playing a montage of Voss's incorrect answers.  The major highlight of this segment was a conversation with Joe Rogan, who detailed his extensive DMT use, describing its effects and ingestion methods, including the (incorrect) method of licking a toad to obtain the substance. He discussed sensory deprivation tanks, the use of marijuana, specifically "breast strips" (which he showed the hosts), and the legality and dangers of various substances, emphasizing his preference for psychedelics over addictive drugs. The segment ended mentioning a video on Rogan’s website showing Ari’s “interesting bottom”, his reaction to "Two Girls One Cup" and the BME Pain Olympics, and a discussion of Nikola Tesla and his alien contact beliefs.

The following segment continued with Joe Rogan, expanding on his DMT experiences and the nature of "bad trips" related to unresolved personal issues.  The conversation broadened to include philosophical discussions about the vastness of space, humanity's insignificance, and extraterrestrial life, using the analogy of a fart to illustrate undetectable life forms.  The discussion turned to dreams, contacting deceased loved ones through them, and Rogan's personal dream experiences, including a recurring dream set and a lucid dream involving a "rape rampage." He recounted a dream encounter with Phil Hartman, helping him process Hartman’s death.  Callers shared their own dream experiences,  the "stoned ape theory," Sumerian civilization, the Anunnaki, and the effects of various drugs on dreams and consciousness.  The hosts continued their off-color banter, making jokes about Rogan and other topics, including his possible sexual behavior in the isolation tank. The segment ended with announcements about upcoming appearances and football picks.

The next segment focused heavily on their new studio, discussing the furniture’s comfort (or lack thereof),  mentioning a stripper pole and ample space for guests and a band.  They addressed listener feedback and technical issues with reruns, defending their editorial decisions.  A caller, John (or possibly Joe), engaged in a humorous, rambling conversation with Anthony.  Kevin Smith called in to discuss his upcoming film, "Zach and Miri Make a Porno," mentioning Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, and Jimmy Norton's participation, touching on drug use, "Jenkum," and online gaming.  A caller’s question sparked a discussion of fighting and martial arts, fueled by Master Poe's call-in, leading to humorous anecdotes and discussion of conflict’s psychology.  The conversation took several tangents, including spelling difficulties, objects found lodged in rectums, bowel movements, the absurdity of celebrity rumors (Richard Gere gerbil rumor), acting techniques, and devices used to portray emotions on screen.

The final segment detailed a prank on "Stalker Patty," involving a marijuana-laced breath strip disguised as a regular one.  With Joe Rogan and a police officer ("Keith the cop") present, the hosts documented Patty's reactions: numbness, dizziness, visual and auditory distortions (including seeing rabbits and Ari Shaffir's penis, which was not exposed), paranoia, and uncontrollable itching. The hosts and Rogan described and reacted to Patty's increasingly impaired state using vulgar language.

The final excerpt focused on Patty's erratic behavior under the influence: difficulty walking, disorientation (an hour of being missing), hallucinations (a rabbit and a monster, mentioning "moons").  The hosts attempted to calm her and get her to the bathroom, ultimately leading to her falling asleep.  The segment included extended bathroom trips, bizarre hallucinations, and the hosts showing videos of Ari's genitals and anus, with detailed descriptions, with Rogan participating. Sam discussed WWE wrestling, with Iron Sheik audio clips played.  The show concluded with further discussion of Patty's behavior and the hosts’ reactions, maintaining the extremely vulgar and irreverent tone.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Anthony, radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony, these people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their offense.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony's striking again.  I sat with some of the greatest dancers in the world.  And I went in there when you ever **** with me again.  This is over.  I was amazed Guns N' Roses was starting to blow up, and you didn't have guitars to play 
[00:01:00]  because you were pointing them off to get some dope.  Yeah, I was a big fan of the age.  Big fan.  Opie and Anthony.  This country went off the cliff, and it's just in free fall.  It's just a sick, sick, it's disgusting, my voice you hear.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  How's everybody today?  Why talk like that?  Good morning.  I don't know, we were just talking a lot about Europeans in the office.  Like former communist people.  Guy that got tased in the airport.  Yeah, we played that audio yesterday.  Yeah.  And now we saw the video before the show.  Saw the video, a little disturbing. 
[00:02:00]  Poor bastard.  The guy looked like he was just really, just very tired from a long flight.  He wanted his mommy.  He just wanted...  Couldn't find his mommy.  Was he a little slow?  I don't know.  I don't think he was.  No, I don't think...  He was just like a strange man in a strange land.  Yeah, he couldn't speak English.  And he was looking for his mother.  Apparently.  Couldn't find her.  And picked up like a little...  A little TV tray. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  That, you know, you'd eat in front of the TV with.  Started throwing that around.  And then he threw a computer.  And, you know, the Canadian mounted police, I guess, came in and tased him.  Well, he also picked up a chair like a lion tamer.  Yeah.  Arr, arr, arr.  And, uh...  I think we've all been in that situation, though.  You have a really long flight.  Because this happened at baggage claim.  And the guy just wanted his bags and wanted his mommy.  That's all.  And he couldn't get either. 
[00:03:00]  It was taking forever.  And we've all been there.  You fly all night or whatever.  It's a late Sunday night.  You know you've got to work on Monday.  And all you want is your bags.  And for some reason...  And your mommy.  And your mommy.  And for some reason, it takes forever to get your luggage.  I don't understand that.  But it does at times.  I wonder if he was a smoker.  Oh, that drives people crazy.  Is that Jones before?  Yeah.  It's awful.  Well, let me tell you.  If he's a European, probably a smoker.  They love their cigarettes over there. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  At this point, I would love to play the story.  But I don't know where it is.  Where's the story?  Yeah.  Well, I'm just going to watch it on the monitor.  Some of the airports have those smoking rooms.  Yeah.  The cancer rooms.  What the hell?  There is not ventilation systems big enough to handle 50 people in a closet, a glass closet smoking.  And you pass by it and look in and just go, oh my God. 
[00:04:00]  But the smokers don't care.  They're standing in there.  The smokers don't need the ventilation.  They don't give a crap.  They don't want the ventilation.  The ventilation is for queers.  They just want to breathe in and out.  They don't even need a pack of cigarettes.  They just walk in.  They got cute names.  You know, I'm going to go to the morgue and smoke a cigarette before we head to baggage claim.  Yeah, let me head into the crypt.  Into the crypt.  Yeah, that's really funny.  No joke, man.  We'll kill you.  I've said this a few times.  You know, I want to say hi to Rochester. 
[00:04:30]  We rarely do, but we're being heard in Rochester.  And when I was living up there, I would see some of that AHL hockey at the Amherst, and  they had a smoking room.  And one of the guys that I would go to the games with from the radio station, he had to  go in there and smoke.  And I would go in there to keep him company.  And you want to talk.  Just like you're saying, it's a cloud of cigarette smoke.  And that was nicknamed the Tombs.  Yeah.  They would call it the Tombs.  And it was just a big, huge room. 
[00:05:00]  No ventilation.  And you could barely see into it, even though it was a glass room.  And it looked like it was foggy inside.  In the old days, that was everywhere.  Like that little room, that's what every place looked like in the whole country.  Because people were smoking everywhere.  Yeah.  You'd be in the airport, and people just smoking.  In the plane.  I remember as a kid, when smoking was allowed on airplanes. 
[00:05:30]  On airplanes.  And you're sitting there going, come on, you're in a tube.  You're in a tube.  And the thing would just fill up with smoke.  Well, we started the bid yesterday, and we got too busy to continue it.  But once again, our ancestors didn't know crap.  The people before us didn't know crap allowing smoking on an airplane.  That's insane.  On a plane?  Back in the day, I was one of those bar smokers.  So I don't, you know, I would have a cigarette here and there.  But when I was flying back, yeah, like you're saying, that's the last thing you want, is a plane filled with smoke. 
[00:06:00]  Even if you were a smoker.  Yep.  Horrible.  And then, like I said, just everywhere, you were able to smoke.  And then I remember when they made a, so they started making laws where you had to have certain smoking sections.  And there's, you know where the Dix Hills Diner is, right?  Sure.  Used to go there all the time.  And when I was smoking, they made a smoking section.  And this thing, you had to push open this door that was vacuum sealed. 
[00:06:30]  And when you walked in there, it was just, you couldn't see the tables.  You had to like kind of work your way through this haze.  And then you're supposed to eat.  Yeah.  And eating and smoking at the same time never, never worked for me.  Eating, you know, smoking after eating is fine.  But during eating, when there's just smoke everywhere, can't do it.  Did you ever see someone eat while they're smoking?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's awful.  It's like really awful food for you and a cigarette in between.  My old man used to do that. 
[00:07:00]  He would do that.  And then he'd take his cigarette and put it out in his food.  Did he really at the end?  Yeah, he's done.  He's like, ah, right into the mashed potatoes.  Put it into the potatoes or, you know, the top of the T-bone or whatever it was.  Joey, you're disgusting.  What do you got to put?  Oh, Ro, shut up.  Take the plate off the table.  Stop fighting.  Stop fighting.  Oh, what a crybaby. 
[00:07:30]  Enough.  I should have slapped them both.  God, there's just times you wish you could just hop in a time machine,  know what you know now, and go back then so that little Anthony could just call them both a-holes  and tell them to shut up, get divorced, and leave us kids in peace.  And save my adulthood.  Yeah, save my goddamn adulthood, please.  Could you?  So I don't have to fall asleep with nightmares from my childhood.  You know what you're cultivating, that I have to sleep with the TV on so I don't have thoughts racing through my head? 
[00:08:00]  Kind of with you, pal.  Kind of with you.  Oh, it's just awful.  Make these visions go away.  I just want a good night's sleep.  That's why I need a distraction at night.  I have to have the TV on or something or music because it's just too many thoughts go flying through your head.  About how you were brought up.  It's just, you wonder, you go like, what the, what was that about?  You're never alone, though.  What was that?  You are never to blame either. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, you're never alone, though.  I think pretty much every person out there had a weird childhood.  Of course.  Especially, you know, our age bracket.  I don't know.  I think every generation has their share of screw-up parents.  But we had some real winners.  They just, not a clue, I guess.  And I don't know if what they're using now is working.  I guess we'll find out in the future.  But, you know, you were talking earlier about a certain type of water, I guess, that's available for children. 
[00:09:00]  Well, one of my good friends had a layover.  He's going overseas for the holidays, and he's with his wife and his newborn.  Three, three and a half months old.  And my really good friend, well, it's the famous Jay from Framingham.  Of course.  A Javalog Jay.  Wow, that's right.  He was the guy that was with Opie during the Javalog burning.  For the people that linger longer.  See? 
[00:09:30]  He wasn't gay.  He's got a kid, a wife.  You've got to know the Javalog story.  That's for another day if you don't know about that one.  But, yeah, he stopped in New York on a little layover.  He had, like, an eight-hour layover because he's going overseas for the holidays.  And he's exhausted.  And Ant knows Jay very well, too.  He's an Irish dude, loves his Irish whiskey.  Any brand of Irish whiskey, this guy will drink.  I spent more drunken nights out with Jay back up in Boston. 
[00:10:00]  Pretty much a functioning slash raging alcoholic, depending on what day of the week it is.  Has a lot of brothers.  Like, the typical Irish family, this guy, Jay.  You know, we all met in Boston, me, Ant, and Jay.  And so now he's married with the kid.  And the kid needed some supplies.  So me and him went to the supermarket while his wife's changing the baby.  You know the deal, right?  Kids always need something.  And we had to find, like, special water for the newborn.  And I'm not making fun of Jay. 
[00:10:30]  I'm not making fun of his wife.  This is just how things are.  We're raising a generation of wimps, basically.  What kind of water?  I didn't even know.  Like, they come in tiny little water bottles for the baby.  And what's in it that's more special?  Fluoride and other stuff that, I guess, a newborn needs.  And we couldn't find the water.  We had to go to three or four different places.  And all Jay wanted to do is hang out my new pad and just mellow out.  Maybe light a Java log.  For old time's sake. 
[00:11:00]  For old time's sake.  And we had to go for it.  Sorry, homo.  Can't do it.  Could you pop this in your mouth, Sally?  For old time's sake.  So, we go to that fine place, Jubilee.  Jimmy knows Jubilee.  It has pretty much everything you could ever possibly want.  Couldn't find it there.  Then we had to go to Dwayne Reed Drugstore, Rite Aid Drugstore.  And finally, we found it in a much larger size.  And I go to Jay.  I'm like, Jay, what the F? 
[00:11:30]  He goes, dude, trust me.  If it was up to me, my kid would be drinking right out of the tap.  You know, that's how we were brought up.  Exactly.  I know nothing's going to happen.  It'll probably make them even tougher drinking out of the tap.  That was what it was.  And I go.  I just drank tap water.  And I go, it's got to be interesting.  You have a kid.  And you got, you know, you got two people that made one thing.  So, how do you decide what this one thing is going to do?  What it's going to eat and all that?  Because I go, Jay, you're definitely different from your wife.  You probably have your way and she has her way. 
[00:12:00]  How do you decide?  And he goes, oh, you just go with her way.  It makes it so much easier in the end.  Oh, he's just got the defeat in early.  Walking all over the place trying to find this special water for the baby.  That's good, though, I think.  You know, it's nice that we're finding a healthy thing.  I think of parents who smoked and stuff back when we were kids and even before that.  They're like, we didn't know it was bad for you.  How couldn't it have been?  I know.  Right.  Like, what in that generation thought that putting smoke in your lungs and going in everyone's face was healthy? 
[00:12:30]  Firemen pull you out of fires or you'll die.  They never lit leaves and just breathed it into a bag.  Exactly.  Let's say hi to Rocco in South Carolina.  Rocco.  Hey, dude.  Oh.  Rocco.  What are y'all doing this morning?  Talking to you, man.  Doing a little radio.  Hey, Atlanta's got the worst.  I used to smoke and I'd walk by there.  I'd have a pack of cigarettes and still not want to go in. 
[00:13:00]  That place was filthy in there.  Oh, the Atlanta airport has a smoking room?  Oh, God, man.  And each one of the terminals has one.  I didn't even want to go near that thing.  You could see the brown tar dripping from the inside of the wall.  Yeah.  The walls were white.  They're brown now.  Yeah.  Yeah, unbelievable.  God.  And everywhere down here, not even just the airport, though.  All of South Carolina?  Yeah.  Filth.  Just about a month ago, though, they changed all that.  Not to you as care, but... 
[00:13:30]  All right.  No.  You have a good one.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Tim the Trucker.  Tim, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  How are you guys?  You guys are all right.  I can listen to you all the time.  Thank you, sir.  I can tell you, back in the 70s, I used to smoke in the grocery store and put them out  on the floor.  Yeah.  Oh, true.  Yeah, yeah.  I think when it's all said and done, the 1970s is going to go down as the greatest, like,  the freaking decade ever.  I think that was the only decade of true freedom.  Oh, yeah.  It's my favorite decade as far as music goes. 
[00:14:00]  And, yeah, you could do whatever the F you wanted.  Whatever you wanted.  It was just like...  I know we're all living healthier, but it...  All right.  Well, Tim, why don't you keep going?  He's a trucker.  He's lonely.  Yeah.  He needs someone to talk to.  I forgot that the truckers get a little lonely out there.  They love talking.  So I can't get mad at Tim.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Continue, Tim.  Go.  No, you could go to a football game and get high.  I just don't understand.  Well, now they're trying to ban, like, smoking in, like, parks and things like that.  Anywhere.  Outside, yeah.  But like Tim is saying, back in the day, supermarkets put the cigarette right out on the floor as you're looking for, you know, none of this 2% milk, by the way. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, the mother would be pushing her kid in the stroller with a cigarette in her mouth, just puffing smoke in the kid's face.  Just trying to find the lard and the whole milk and...  Lard.  And the bacon.  No egg whites back then.  We invented egg whites and, like, why would you separate the tasty part from the icky part?  Us wimps invented egg whites.  Yeah.  I remember the smell of the cigarette, like, I used to love it.  I didn't like smoke.  My mother smoked.  I don't remember my dad smoked.  My mother smoked. 
[00:15:00]  And I remember liking the smell of the cigarette when it first got lit.  Like, when the match, the first puff of the cigarette smelled really good.  Yeah.  And then it was just awful.  No one liked it.  To this day, I love the smell of a cigarette.  Really?  When I smell someone smoking it, especially if it's a little bit in the distance.  Oh, yeah, right, yeah.  And it's not, like, yeah, right in my face.  Yeah, absolutely.  I, uh, nah.  I love the smell of it.  Love the smell of pot.  Don't smoke pot.  Pot smells great.  Don't smoke.  In the baggie, in the joint.  Look at Pat Duffy smiling. 
[00:15:30]  He's smiling over there.  We think pot smells good.  He's like, yeah, tell me about it.  Some tells me he's smelt it a little more recently than we have.  Are we supposed to be surprised that he's smiling?  Look at that beard.  That's a pothead's beard.  Oh, of course it is.  Pat Duffy.  That's not a martini beard, man.  That's a, that's either a meth beard or a, or a meth freaking pot slash coke beard.  There he is.  There's something going on with that kid. 
[00:16:00]  I'm just glad he hasn't killed anyone yet.  Uh, let's go back to, uh, Ohio.  Pete, what's up?  Pete.  Is your, uh, buddy Jay raising a super kid?  Linger longer.  Oh, super kid.  Well, I had no idea that you could get water for, like, a newborn, like that special water.  No clue.  We didn't have any of that stuff.  No.  We didn't have baby formulas.  We had to eat, like, like.  It was adult food.  Yeah.  After you passed, uh, uh, breastfeeding and then baby food. 
[00:16:30]  You know what?  I don't even think they had a lot of choices with the baby food back in the day.  I, I remember my mom, like, blending up crap.  Really?  Blending up, like, adult food.  I'm sorry.  You were just poor.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  There was, there was, there was Gerber's.  I, I remember Gerber's.  And, um, there was that.  But once you passed that, there wasn't any of this, because there's, there's food now  for every little, uh, change in a kid's life. 
[00:17:00]  You know, every three months, there's another upgrade of the type of food they should be  eating put out by these baby food companies.  Once you passed baby food, it was pretty much, uh, they're cutting up your steak into these  little bite-sized pieces and giving you your potato and, and you just ate adult food.  No, that was all just blended up.  Blended?  Yeah, the steak and everything.  Steak, throw the potatoes in the air and maybe a little, uh, I don't know, peas or something.  Blended all up into one.  Uh, let's say hi to Scott in Iowa. 
[00:17:30]  Scott, what's up?  Hey, uh, love you, love the show.  Um, because I'm not smoking, we had a weird, uh, system at our, um, rodeo grounds, um, where  you'd sit up in the arena, but you couldn't smoke up in the arena.  You had to go out and underneath the seats to smoke.  Oh, like under the bleachers?  Wait, the smoking section was under the bleachers?  Yes, it still is.  Wouldn't it just come up through the bleachers and, and...  Yeah.  That's brilliant.  Well, I'm in Iowa, so what do you expect? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, makes perfect sense.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Tommy in Jersey.  Tommy, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I'm working in an oil terminal, and we store oil for, uh, different companies, and  we store oil for Philip Morris cigarettes.  This stuff called triacid, and it eats up stainless steel.  And it's in cigarettes?  It's in cigarettes.  They spray it on the tobacco to keep it moist, they said.  Yeah.  That's what it's for, to keep it moist.  They're eventually going to outlaw it completely, because the tobacco companies have lied. 
[00:18:30]  I mean, they kind of brought it on themselves by lying.  It's like, they haven't told the truth since 1950.  Too entrenched in this country, though.  Tobacco growing, tobacco farming is part of, you know, what made this country.  Yeah.  So...  Also, it's slavery.  They kind of found a way around that.  Yeah.  Well...  Let's go to Jay in New York.  Jay, what's up?  Yo, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  Yo, I was gonna, um, I had a layover on my way to California last Christmas.  There was this, like, 80-year-old lady, no joke, sitting in the smoking booth at the 
[00:19:00]  slot machines, ready to cough up the lungs, sitting in a fucking wheelchair.  Curse.  Okay.  There he goes.  Boom.  Yeah, I think we all have one of those stories.  I remember as a kid, like, a distant relative at, like, a Christmas party or whatever,  was smoking through the hole in the throat.  Yeah, through the hole in the throat.  Yeah.  You know.  At a Christmas party.  What a funny juxtaposition. 
[00:19:30]  Everybody's celebrating, and then this person's got a hole in their neck with a tree behind  them.  Neck balls with mouth of mommy.  Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma.  Ma-ma-ma-ma.  Ma-ma-ma-ma.  Ma-ma-ma-ma.  Ma-ma-ma.  Ma-ma-ma-ma.  Ma-ma-ma-ma.  Just a downer.  Well, he had that...  Ruining everyone's good time.  He had the, uh, the big, like, bandage over his neck.  Yeah, that hides it.  And I asked my dad.  He told me, yeah, the guy, you know, it's because of smoking and blah, blah, blah.  Look under it.  And then all of a sudden, I remember a little later on, he went outside, pulled the bandage aside, and was smoking through the hole. 
[00:20:00]  Smoked through the hole.  How do you bring yourself to put a cigarette to your neck?  I guess you figure, look, I got a hole in my neck.  That's cool.  What the hell?  I don't want to live.  But you don't have neck lips.  Yeah, how do you?  You got to just kind of.  You can't take that good drink.  There's no, like if you put a cigarette in your mouth and then just suck it right into your lungs, it's not very pleasurable.  You have to like inhale it into your mouth. 
[00:20:30]  That's just like sucking it directly into your lungs.  But I imagine if you're in that position, you think, ah, the cigarettes did all the damage it could possibly do.  Now I'm just going to enjoy the cigarettes again.  Yeah, that's it.  They took out the bad parts.  Yeah, they already took out the bad parts.  What are the odds it's going to come back?  Good luck, bro.  We got this.  Let's play this.  You don't know we die from tobacco.  Sometimes you just lose a love. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, you don't know we die from tobacco.  Sometimes they just sniff out your tongue.  And you won't sing what the heck with a big hole in your neck.  Don't you don't always die from tobacco.  Hey, I would see that live.  That's good, yeah.  This is kind of catchy.  The vocals are very good, though.  No, it's something.  I think it was mixed wrong. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, they've got to replace the singer.  Yeah.  I'm sure they'll have to soon anyway.  But we're talking about the guy that got tased to death, and we started talking about smoking.  That's what we do on this show.  I don't know.  Went off on a tear.  Kids smoking, everything.  Can I add what a great commercial that is, though?  The anti-smoking people have really been like, for some reason, that's where the creativity is going in advertising.  Yeah.  There's some damn good anti-smoking commercials.  Except for those goddamn truth commercials, where the young, you know, know-it-alls get up there with the bullhorn. 
[00:22:00]  Did you know that babies die because of smoke?  And you're like, shut up.  That's terrible.  Shut up, know-it-all.  It should end with, man.  Yeah, man.  Like, we're stacking these body bags here, man, to show how many people die because of big tobacco.  Man.  Man.  Are you?  You stacking them there?  In my way, I've got to get to work.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  I've got a job to get to.  All right.  Well, the phones are lit. 
[00:22:30]  We'll continue with phone calls next, I guess.  Also, let's not forget, we've got $1,000 giveaway starting at 7 today.  Between 7 and 7.30, this is what you're listening for.  Hi, I'm Kenny, and I love the taffy.  Making one of our listeners a star today.  That's Kenny.  Who called you?  Punch him in the face.  Face full of taffy.  Just comes out his nose when you hit him right in the mouth.  He loves taffy so much that the dumb taffy pulled a few teeth out of his mouth.  Yeah.  And he needs the $1,000 so he could get the teeth back in his mouth. 
[00:23:00]  So hence why we're using Kenny today.  All right.  All on the way, it's Opie and Anthony.  Come on.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning.  Oh, you need to pay $100,000.  What?  Jimmy, can't hear you.  What?  I heard Danny could pay $100,000 to use this for tourgasm.  Songs are expensive.  Chump change for him.  Chump change.  How much did the band get, I wonder?  I think they got $50.  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:23:30]  And a tourgasm DVD box set.  And the record company pockets the rest.  I want to say good morning to Boston.  Good morning to Buffalo.  Good morning to Syracuse.  Good afternoon to Cleveland.  Good mid-morning to Washington.  Grand Rapids, Maine.  Do we continue?  Oh, my God.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  What's wrong?  I hate everything.  You hate everything?  This woman, this stripper who outed De La Hoya's little underwear fetish, is suing him because 
[00:24:00]  he claimed the embarrassing photos were phony.  I guess he called her character into nature.  Good question?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So now she put out another picture and she's saying he's lying and she's suing him.  We know he's lying.  He was a championship fighter.  What do you want him to do in this photo of a girl's underwear?  Jesus, Ira, could you warn me before you pop that picture up? 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Holy Jesus, Palomino.  With the bat wing hanging out.  It's like his bat wing is hanging out.  He's covered in fishnet.  Yeah, a little oopsie happening as he attempts to wear tiny little panties and fishnets.  Looks like something you pull out of the water in Lake Moe.  Yeah.  Put the net, the big fishnet around.  Caught a biggie.  I think she caught a skate fish.  A skate.  Yuck.  He's just... 
[00:25:00]  So I don't understand this.  So he's in his panties and doing his thing with this Russian model.  Why did she release the photos to begin with?  Did they have a falling out?  No, I don't know.  Did we ever get that answer?  I don't think we did, right?  No, but I'm looking at other photos of them.  Obviously, I thought she was just some hooker that he bagged, but apparently they were seeing  each other.  I don't know if he paid her or not, but this was an ongoing thing, so maybe he trusted her  with taking pictures, which why would you...  Jesus, put them on your own hard drive, you silly goose.  Look at them.  Trust a stripper with photos of you. 
[00:25:30]  That's a tough nut.  I don't even trust my own mother.  With your nude pictures and your fishnets?  My mother always takes mine because she doesn't get emotional about it.  Lower the leg.  You look stupid.  Oh, God.  He's just going through.  Those pictures never get old.  So, of course, Oscar...  Of course...  Yeah.  Of course, Oscar's going to deny it.  This isn't good for his career.  No.  Can you go back to Eric?  I'll tell you which one's my favorite.  And it kind of...  That one?  No.  The one where they had a whiteout, whatever was going on there? 
[00:26:00]  There's one where he's just standing there with a full fishnet outfit and a wig and  a pair of panties, but he's just kind of leaning on the wall looking with his arm, and it  just looks like Oscar with a wig.  Yeah.  It's great.  He's not even trying to be feminine.  It's not as creepy when he's wearing the wig, believe it or not.  He looks like Stuttering John.  Yeah.  He looks like John Melendez.  Big panties and a fishnet outfit.  The face.  That's what Melendez's face looks like.  But so then he did what he should do. 
[00:26:30]  He denied it all the way, and now she's like, screw that.  I'm suing you for $100 million.  And then she released a picture where he's hugging her, and it makes it even harder to  say that it was Photoshopped.  They're obviously not Photoshopped.  Oh, my God.  I mean, oh, no, no.  What's hanging out over there?  Oh, no.  A picture of him in a miniskirt.  A nice vinyl or silky miniskirt.  Yes, that would be great on a girl.  One of the miniskirts the women now wear where it's high enough where you could get a panty 
[00:27:00]  shot.  Yep.  Yep.  But in this case, you're seeing more than just a little panty.  Go up, E-Rock.  I want to see more.  Looks like Asian porn.  Do you, Jimmy?  No, no.  I mean, I want to see the rest of the outfit.  Oh, how gauche.  He's wearing a lime green T-shirt.  The shirt has breasts painted on it.  Yeah.  It's like drawing a photograph of breasts on it, and this little weird ... I understand  Oscar's a pervert, and that's fine.  Good boy, Oscar.  But how can you think that she likes it? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  I'm never delusional about a fetish.  I know that a lot of times they're doing it because they want to do it for you, but  how could you think that she really liked photographing you in that silly outfit?  I don't know.  She probably just wanted to go out with Oscar and have some sex with him, and wow, I'm  with this boxer, and then he comes up with these wacky, harebrained ideas, and she's  just like, oh, what's wrong with just some regular sex?  I may have figured it out, by the way.  Yeah?  Go ahead.  All these photos, or a lot of these photos, are of them together, so she didn't take them. 
[00:28:00]  What probably happened was, even the ones she took probably were on his hard drive.  That's probably a camera that's been set up.  Like, you know, all right, jump back, count to five, and the camera will snap, probably  an automatic timer.  They probably were on his hard drive, on a laptop or something, and she probably copied  it.  She probably went into the file and grabbed them.  Mm-hmm.  That makes more sense.  Yeah, that would explain the weird faces he makes, because it's obvious to me that he  looks completely out of it.  Yeah.  Smashed on something, but he's, you know, he only has five seconds to hold, like, a weird 
[00:28:30]  smile, and it's not coming across right, because you don't know when the shot is actually going  to be taken.  Ugh.  So that's happening today.  Also, we've got Barry Bonds.  Liar!  Liar!  You're a liar.  A liar!  He's been indicted.  This was huge news, man.  This is big, because he could actually go to jail for perjury.  Anyone that gets their sports updates on their phones, man, that was going off like crazy 
[00:29:00]  yesterday, huh?  Anyone else?  My God.  Barry Bonds has been indicted.  Could go away for 30 years.  His excuses are pretty silly.  How do you take these steroids, these, what do they call them, enhancing?  I like to call them anabolicals.  Anabolic steroids.  Anabolical, though.  And a diabolical.  I'm going to take diabolical steroids.  How do you take them and not know you're taking them? 
[00:29:30]  I don't know.  That's pretty much what his whole thing is.  I didn't, it wasn't with my knowledge.  Right.  So, when someone was jabbing a needle in your butt cheek, what did you think was going  on?  I wonder if they'll...  Vitamins?  Will they take it away if he's actually legally convicted or know the title?  I don't know.  No.  They won't.  I don't, well, I don't know.  That's a really good question, actually, Jimmy.  I don't know.  I have to have a couple asterisks. 
[00:30:00]  That old asterisk thing.  Barry Bonds baseball's home run king was indicted for perjury and obstruction of justice  Thursday and could face prison instead of the Hall of Fame for telling a federal grand  jury he did not knowingly use performance-enhancing drugs.  If convicted, he could be sentenced to a maximum of 30 years in prison.  30 years in prison.  Shortly after the indictment was handed up, Bonds' personal trainer, Greg Anderson, was  ordered released after spending most of the past year in prison for refusing to testify  against his longtime friend. 
[00:30:30]  And so what?  Wow.  So what?  He decided to talk from behind the bars there?  Yeah, that guy, I guess he spent a little too much time in jail.  And he was like, hey, I'll sing.  I'm going to sing.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Asked directly if Anderson supplied him with steroids, Bonds answered, not that I know  of.  Bonds even denied taking steroids when he was shown documents revealing a positive steroids  test for a player named Barry B. 
[00:31:00]  Barry B.  I wonder who that is.  I'm getting a little report here that he didn't talk.  Oh, he didn't talk?  I heard he was talking.  And that kind of helped out this whole indictment.  I really don't know.  But they, it's kind of weird that the guy.  We're like the CW 11 news here.  We're talking out our butts.  We don't know what the hell we're saying.  Yeah, but at least we're not claiming to be a news program.  This is true.  We're just trying to entertain people.  What's up there, Jimmy?  What is Oscar going to do?  He's all I'm thinking of right now.  You're obsessed with Oscar. 
[00:31:30]  I'm looking at this picture of them together.  Apparently, he stopped calling.  I'm sorry to go back to it.  Go ahead.  He's a boxer.  Yeah.  How do you?  Yeah.  But he doesn't really box anymore.  No, no.  I know.  But he's a Latin guy.  Those are very macho.  It's just.  Very macho kind of a thing.  Yeah.  And he was probably going, oh, good.  The story died down.  My pictures aren't showing up on the internet.  And then they were all over the news.  You look at a huge screen TV, and there it is.  It's in the newspapers now, the pictures.  But it is kind of weird that it is news. 
[00:32:00]  Like, I mean, I understand.  I'm a voyeur, too.  I want to see it because I'm a creep.  But it is kind of like, what is newsworthy about the fact that the guy just liked to put  on panties and be called Goldie?  Why would you take up, like, real news space with that?  Goldie.  I guess because he's golden gloves.  I don't know.  I would have liked it more if he wore a blonde wig.  But, I mean, that's just my preference.  What would your chick name be if you were a tranny or just a transvestite? 
[00:32:30]  You like dressing up as a woman and going out at night.  What would you pick as your chick name?  E-Rock.  Oh, poor E-Rock.  I don't.  I've never thought of that because I have no desire to cross-dress.  I don't know.  Don't answer.  No, no, I have to.  No, you've got to answer.  I have to.  It's a trap.  I know there's no way out.  It's always got to be some stupid variation on your real name.  So, I would have, like, an old, old name, like Antoinette or something. 
[00:33:00]  No, but what would you want it to be?  Oh, Crystal.  I have no idea.  I've never thought of that.  Christine's a nice name.  I want to be named after a hard liquor.  Oh, like what?  Mmm.  Hard liquor.  A hard liquor.  Mmm.  You never thought about it?  Never.  But, I mean, I'm thinking about it now.  I'm thinking Christine with a K would be nice.  And a Y. 
[00:33:30]  K-R-Y.  Yeah, yeah.  Christine.  It's got to be sexy.  Exotic.  Because they all pick these, like, sexy names, and they're just messes.  By the way, a lot of people are saying that Bonds, his trainer, did not talk.  Okay.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey real fast.  I'd like to file this correction.  Yeah, Mike.  All right.  Mike says, you said.  All right.  You know who I feel sorry for with the De La Hoya thing?  It's all the people you beat the crap out of.  Because, you know, those people are out there somewhere, and their friends are going, 
[00:34:00]  you got beat by a girl.  The guy that dresses like a chick.  And then you're like, no, it was Oscar De La Hoya.  No, you got beat by a girl.  When you were laying on the canvas, were you able to look up his skirt?  He was here.  He was a great interviewer that day we had him.  He was a very good interviewer.  It would have been a greater interview if these pictures came out beforehand.  That day?  Oh, boy, would that have been wonderful.  Hey, Oscar, check the computer screen.  He sat right on that couch, and he was hiding a secret.  Yes, he was.  I bet you he had on thong underpants.  Can you imagine?  He probably had something on. 
[00:34:30]  Or boy shorts.  He probably had both boy shorts.  It would be great to just turn around.  Like, he walked in, sat down, and just go, so, Goldie, tell us what you're doing these days.  He probably would laugh at Goldie.  Goldie?  What are you talking about?  And then just clobber all of us.  No, just laugh, and then tent in his shorts.  I bet you the name Goldie just whipped him into a feminine froth.  You know, like, if he was mad, you'd just call him Goldie, and he'd just, oh, no, you didn't.  He'd just go into that little character.  Yeah.  Let's go to Andrew New Rochelle. 
[00:35:00]  He just saw something interesting.  He has to get on our show.  Andrew, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Got something cool for you.  I work here at Sound Shore Medical in Westchester County, New Rochelle.  Put it out there, put it on the map.  And we had something called an ambiguous birth today, about an hour ago.  What that basically means is that the child was born with both genitalias, and I'm really  both.  I was so curious to see it.  I went upstairs, and I had to go look at it.  And there was a penis, and underneath that penis was a hole.  And that kid was the only kid I knew that could actually go F himself. 
[00:35:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  Let me ask you a question.  All right, hold on.  I've got to make that joke.  Dumb joke.  I'm sorry.  After the ambiguous.  Hold on, Andrew.  Andrew, hold on.  We want to try to get some of this on the air, and the dumb joke might have messed it up.  Ambiguous birth, baby born in this hospital with both genitals, a penis, and also partial  female genitals.  Isn't that a hermaphrodite?  That's not that uncommon, is it?  Yeah, that is a hermaphrodite.  You know what?  It's one in 75-something thousand, they say it happens.  This is the second one we've had this year.  So I guess it's something in the water up here at New Rochelle that's just making these 
[00:36:00]  babies come out like that.  That's very interesting.  Got a career in video.  That's pretty much it.  Yeah.  Get a career in some freak videos when you get older.  I might have seen that on film.  I'm not sure.  But that's...  All right.  I wanted to take some pictures.  The doctor wouldn't let me, because, you know, obviously...  Of course not.  I don't even think it's a hospital.  Yeah.  Why don't you just bring your friends in, too, and pass the baby around?  What's the matter with you?  Point and laugh through the glass.  I did bring my friends up, and we did kind of...  Two of my friends did see it.  I snuck them up to do that. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Just point and laugh at the mother's womb.  There you go.  All right.  You guys have a good day, man.  Thanks, man.  Has anyone else seen anything out there?  Give us a call.  That indecisive womb.  I don't know what.  I don't know.  Left, right.  I don't know.  In the middle here.  You want a boy curl?  One of each.  I think...  Spinning chromosomes like plates.  No one's going to see anything crazier than that this morning.  No, you're right.  No, that's pretty rare.  Unless the lady that puts on makeup on dead people calls today. 
[00:37:00]  She was supposed to call as she was putting makeup on a dead person.  She hasn't called back yet.  Yeah, yeah.  She was going to...  As she was doing it.  Yeah.  Ugh.  That probably would be one of the only things that beats what we just heard.  Mm-hmm.  I don't think anyone's going to see anything weirder today as we're broadcasting.  Do you think you'd like dressed up like a girl?  I don't know about would or not.  No, I don't think so.  I don't think it's gay at all if you're with a girl at all.  I think it's more...  If you're with a girl, there's something weird there.  It's weird.  It might not be a gay thing.  I don't like... 
[00:37:30]  But there's just something a little weird that you would even entertain that.  There could be...  All right.  Let's say it's a drunken night and you decide to put on your chick's panties and prance  around because it's funny.  Sure.  Are you just saying?  I'm just...  A random example I'm pulling out of deep-seated memories.  I don't like mixing my comedy with my sex.  No, I don't mean...  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:38:00]  I just picture if I had something on, it would just get a very...  It would get a laugh and it would take away from the sex.  It would get a laugh.  I don't like mixing the comedy and the sex.  You could have a little comedy before the sex.  You might have a little laugh during.  That's kind of fun.  Maybe a little chuckle, but...  A little chuckle.  Not an all-out laugh.  You don't want guffaws or belly laughs during sex.  Absolutely not.  A chuckle is good.  I put them on one time in my life, a girl's panties.  I told a girl I was dating at the time and we did some very kinky things and she asked 
[00:38:30]  me to put them on.  And I did.  Well, she did things, let's just say, while I had them on to me.  Uh-huh.  Which was amazing and filthy and it was hot.  Well, the material is very nice.  Yeah.  We've got to give it that.  You look good in them.  As a guy, if you want to show off, believe me, that's the way to do it.  A thong, it just looks like, my God, it can't contain me.  I'm such a man, it can't contain me.  I'm bursting.  When you put on regular underpants, it's awful. 
[00:39:00]  Well, was she turned on by that?  Very.  Let's just say we had...  See, I wonder about that because don't you think most women want a man and if you're doing  something like that, does it take away from being a man?  No, she liked the way a guy's body looked in them.  She liked the way it hugged a guy's body and showed a guy off.  That was what she liked about it.  It kind of turned me off that she was so dirty, she wanted to see things like that.  Certain material also shows contours better than other materials.  So that, the material that women's panties are made of, really shows contours. 
[00:39:30]  So you know...  It's not talking from memory anymore.  What?  You're kidding.  You've got too many details in there.  I've slipped them on before during, you know, hijinks.  Have you?  Yeah.  Jimmy's like backing up.  You did.  I'm not knocking it.  I certainly have.  Anyone's just waiting for, you know, someone to admit it in the room.  It's just, uh... 
[00:40:00]  It was funny.  How many times?  I didn't do it to be funny.  How many times have you done it?  Just once.  I swear to you, just once.  I don't know about that because you say his wife.  Anthony said, I've slipped.  I've slipped.  Not I slipped.  I slipped as once.  I've slipped them on during hijinks.  That's fine.  I don't care that you did.  I think it's fine.  No, no, that was...  He's basically saying, let's put it this way.  Tuesday is panty night.  Tuesday is not panty night.  And I didn't slip them on during hijinks.  You're trying to trip me up with my words. 
[00:40:30]  I'm not even knocking.  I think it's good.  It was one time.  And then the girl also put on my undies and looked really silly.  All right.  So what happened?  So we did like a silly thing.  It was silly.  But what happened when you had hers on?  Which kind did she have?  A thong or boy shorts?  It was, uh...  It wasn't a thong.  They were just regular, like, high-cut panties.  How long did you leave them on for?  Like boy shorts?  No, they were regular, like, girl, just regular girl underwear.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  No thong thing.  It was like, you know, the back.  But the sides were cut up very nicely, very high on my hips. 
[00:41:00]  A French cut?  A French cut, yes.  It was very high on my hips.  If we had balls, we would all, like, you know, put on panties and take pictures and  put it on the internet.  Why would we do that?  Just to be complete idiots.  I'll do that in a second.  Without, like, maybe not even showing our faces.  Oh, God, no.  I'd be more embarrassed about my gut.  I would have to wear, like, an upper lingerie thing like Oscar had, but not with...  Fish dance, because I have body issues. 
[00:41:30]  I had a baby.  I never quite bounced back.  We should start a panty club.  I agree.  A man's man panty club.  Who's with me?  I don't think that's...  I was just saying the contours.  Well, let's say hi to Charlie in Long Island.  Charlie has a question for you.  Charlie?  Charlie, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, Anthony, is it Thong Thursday?  Do you want to ask?  No, it is not Thong Thursday either.  I honestly don't. 
[00:42:00]  Well, it was one of those funny things.  I want to do it again.  I would do it again.  Do you?  Yeah, but I never thought about it.  I don't think about it during sex.  My girlfriend's not into that, but I...  You want a pair of mine?  How do you have one right now?  It's funny if you rip them off.  They're edible.  We just made out on the air and ignored everybody.  Right.  Keep going, Jim.  I almost said made love and then realized I'd be silly without kissing first.  Well, let's...  We do have to take a break.  We're getting close to doing another contest here.  Of course, you know it starts at 7 by now.  I hope you know that. 
[00:42:30]  Don't forget, it's Point and Laugh Friday.  It's Fart Friday.  Yes.  I don't know if that's taken off, but as a goof, we start Fart Friday.  It's also Is Tom Alive Friday.  He wasn't too good last week.  We'll see if he checks in today.  Pretty bad.  And also, it's FU Friday.  So with that, I think we should go to the FU line and see what people are screaming and yelling  about today.  Yes.  It's all on the Opie and Anthony show.  Check out the FU line, and I'm trying to stall here.  There it is.  Okay.  Here's the FU line.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line. 
[00:43:00]  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have six new voice messages.  First voice message.  Yeah, this is Keith from Rochester.  F*** you for making me watch that two girls, one cup video.  Opie and Anthony, you are f***ing gross.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to send a big f*** you to the stupid fat bitch who didn't hit me.  F*** you, you fat bitch.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Matt from Alabama.  I just want to say a big FU to my f***ing boss, making me work eight days in a f***ing row. 
[00:43:30]  F*** you.  Next message.  Yeah, I'm at work right now, and I'd like to give a big f*** you to the people I work for.  They're f***ing, and I hope that they all die of spontaneous combustion.  F*** you, you f***ing.  Next message.  I'd like to give a big FU to my wife, you ugly fat bitch who doesn't f*** no more.  I got somebody new who's going to take care of that for me, and that's going to be your sister, who's a better f***er than you've ever been. 
[00:44:00]  So a big FU to my wife.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Jay in Jersey.  I want to give a big f*** you to all my bosses over there that are on the job in Jersey.  Don't f*** yourself.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line, 866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you, and goodbye. 
[00:44:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Another busy one, by the way.  Joe Rogan just arrived.  We're going to get him in in a few minutes.  Ari.  And Ari, who's very funny in his own right.  People are saying that you should check out Joe Rogan's Two Girls, One Cup reaction video.  I haven't seen it yet.  Yeah?  That's all the rage on the internet.  You get your reaction video to Two Girls, One Cup, throw it up there, and you get a few views.  We've had a bit of success doing that very thing.  Certainly have.  People are very disgusted by that video. 
[00:45:00]  I was at the comedy show the other night, and one of the girls, the manager there, was watching that.  And I'm like, you've got to go to the Bob Kelly.  She was watching something else.  And I'm like, go to the Bob Kelly reaction.  And she watched.  We all know Bobby there.  And she was rolling.  She's like how easily he wants.  Yeah.  Watching Bob throw up.  It's one of those joys in life.  Oh, yeah.  He really throws up.  He wretches.  And the sound.  It really is amazing.  He's got to be ripping his stomach lining right out.  When nature created vomiting, because horses die because they can't throw up. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  Like when they created vomiting to Richard, that's what they meant.  Yeah.  Like he's getting rid of everything.  No, but you've got to go.  Go to YouTube.  Throw in Opie and Anthony in the search.  And do, you know, date added.  So you get the latest videos.  And you'll get all the reactions from all our comedian friends.  There's a lot of them up there.  By the way, I need, like, I don't know.  I've got to admit something.  Is there something wrong with my hair today?  It's like sticking up a little bit. 
[00:46:00]  You notice, right?  Yeah.  And, you know, for the most part, we don't give a crap.  We just kind of roll out of bed.  I actually jump in the shower just to try to wake up.  I could come in here with greasy hair every day.  I don't really care.  But I think something's going on with my hair today.  And it's because of my girl's stupid products in the shower.  I don't know which one is shampoo.  What did you grab?  I don't know.  You grabbed the conditioner and thought it was shampoo.  No, it's really dry and sticking up.  It looks, I swear to God, it looks like I have fake hair today.  Did you grab her body wash? 
[00:46:30]  I don't know.  With pumice?  Or douche.  I knew that was a weird applicator.  Douche your head.  I just want to point it out because I noticed a couple weird looks this morning.  Like, I think he's finally completely going insane.  He's now got the hair looking like he's insane.  He's got crazy hair.  But I don't buy my own shampoo.  And the shower's filled with all these bottles.  And they don't even say shampoo or conditioner on it anymore.  No, you don't know what they are.  It was in some kind of foreign language.  And I was like, I guess this is shampoo.  Because there were two of them. 
[00:47:00]  So I figured one was shampoo, one was conditioner.  But I guess it's something else.  I don't know what it is.  Why don't you guys have different bathrooms?  Like, I could never, like, if you don't have to share the bathroom, I would love to.  Well, because I'm getting the place redone.  And we're all, like, kind of just shoved into one area right now.  See, that, unless you have a very big bathroom.  No, I'm talking about when you want to go in there and fire a good one off.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sick of lighting matches.  Because I have one and a half baths, so I only have one shower.  I know.  You're poor.  So a lot of times, my girlfriend, if I'm in my room doing something, I'll just make the 
[00:47:30]  bitch go use the sink to wash her hair.  I'm like, go in there and take a Puerto Rican shower.  The bitch.  The bitch.  That's not nice.  So.  Is that wrong?  I'll have the answer on Monday, because I'll ask her what I use, because I swear to God,  doesn't it look like I have, like, plugs or something in the front?  No, it just looks very, like you had some kind of a moose in it, and it's just kind  of sticking up.  But it's dry, like straw. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, you probably used a body wash or something.  I have no idea.  I have no idea.  You ever wash your hair with just soap?  Yeah.  And it ends up like that.  See, you probably used some type of.  Stop making it so complicated out there.  Just shampoo in a white bottle, conditioner in a white bottle.  That's all I need.  That's all you need.  By the way, for Anthony.  Panty party!  No!  Yeah, people are trying to get a panty party together for you.  I am not having a panty party.  Panty party!  They're just trying to help you out a little bit.  I'm not having a panty party.  They want you to start Anthony's panty party. 
[00:48:30]  Panty party!  What do you say?  No.  No?  Well, you know, you try to share.  I don't think there's anything wrong with it, dude.  All right.  How come Jimmy did it?  And no one says anything about him, but I do it once.  Because we all look at him like he's a creep already.  I never even said when it was.  Wasn't, you know, wasn't recently.  Tell you that.  Ed Wood talked about wearing women's clothes, and he said he didn't.  I like to wear women's clothing.  But he said, no, I love women.  It makes me feel closer to them.  He just liked that feeling, and he wasn't gay at all. 
[00:49:00]  He loved chicks.  I mean, so I don't think there's anything.  I don't think De La Hoya is a fruit at all.  Yeah.  Then again, I've heard he did, like, other things as well.  Yeah, that kind of did make him.  Well, you've got some inside info that you're not willing to share about good old Oscar De La Hoya.  Well, I don't know.  Let's just say that I heard that he liked to be made into an Oscar popsicle.  By the way, people are pointing out that the show's a little weird today. 
[00:49:30]  Anthony talking about his one time, one time only, that he tried on panties, and now we're talking about my hair.  Oh, Jesus.  It's a weird one today.  Hey, do you guys remember these dumb noises?  Ow, ow, ow, ow.  What?  The sounds of Steve, one of our guys here on the Opie and Anthony show.  Ow.  And this one.  Ow.  And this one.  Ow.  I didn't realize.  Ow.  See, there are things around here that take off with the staff. 
[00:50:00]  This is what's taking off with the staff.  We all walk around imitating Steve now.  Ow.  Ow.  He goes into production to do something, and he does this into the mic for some reason.  So if we're just talking about the show and trying to get things done, people will answer in Steve's special way.  Oh, I didn't realize.  I hate that one.  How can you not?  Well, what's so weird about this show, and which is kind of fun from where we sit, you never know what's going to take off. 
[00:50:30]  And the listeners, CokeLogic took one of those sounds, and he put it to Brickhouse.  You might have heard it, but we got a couple new ones today.  But here's the original.  So CokeLogic took those noises and did this with them.  Ow, she's a, ow, ow.  She's mighty, mighty.  Just letting it all hang out.  She's a, ow, ow.  I like Lady Stack, and that's a fact. 
[00:51:00]  I ain't holding nothing back.  Ow, she's a, ow, ow.  Well, look together, everybody knows.  This is how the story goes.  Ah.  There you go.  It's ending.  So CokeLogic got the ball rolling, right?  And we got a couple new ones.  Matter of fact, Than and Danny came up with one.  Yes.  This is just hitting the presses as we speak here.  This I, uh, this I knew was coming. 
[00:51:30]  Of course.  Quick, get to the point from, uh, Dan and Danny.  That's a good one.  What do you think there, Jimmy? 
[00:52:00]  I like it.  You like it, right?  I certainly do.  I'm trying to think of a good name for the song, and of course, I'm falling flat.  Ah.  No improv skills.  Sounds like Zeppelin.  And then we got, uh, Cradle of Milf submitted one.  And they're starting to say this might, uh, be better than CokeLogics.  Yeah.  Uh, Tears Are Falling.  Anyone?  Anyone?  I like that song.  By?  Uh, well, originally by, uh, uh, the two guys.  Ed Norton.  It was in Donnie Darko, right?  That one?  Oh, no.  It's a different one.  Different. 
[00:52:30]  Uh, no.  It's a different one.  Tears Are Falling.  Kiss?  Oh, that's New Kids.  Tears Are Falling.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't like that.  Well, this is what, uh, was done with that song.  You'll like it now.  I don't feel so funny.  I don't feel so funny.  Billy Fitz.  I didn't really know. 
[00:53:00]  That was good.  Hey, man.  The listener's got some creativity, man.  That's for sure.  How do you hear that in his dumb noise?  That's funny.  It fits perfect.  What's again?  Cradle of milk with that, uh, with that doozy.  All right.  Hey, uh, moving on.  I, I watched the debate last night.  Yes.  I figured I would try to be a little, uh, more knowledgeable with this, you know, with  this politics thing.  And, uh, I, I, I, now I, I just realized why I hate them all.  And I won't, I won't be voting once again. 
[00:53:30]  I watched, uh, one of the debates and was just like, oh, okay.  Nothing's changed.  It's the same business as usual.  Politicians avoiding, uh, answering a question at all costs.  Well, Hillary eventually answered the, uh, immigration, uh, driver's licenses.  Yes.  After Elliot Spitzer, uh, backed down from it.  Oh, she sucks.  She is just a phony, uh, just, uh, uh, waffling.  She's a fat legs.  That's what she is.  She's a fat legs.  Fat legs.  I don't like her pantsuits or the way her fat legs waffle out when she's wearing her 
[00:54:00]  stupid slacks.  Mom slacks.  Smart business slacks.  Yeah.  Fat legs.  But the point is they all suck.  They all suck and they all can't answer a question.  Yeah.  And during the debate last night, it was getting to the point where the audience was openly  laughing at all of them up on that stage because nobody would answer a question.  Yeah, I know.  And I, I got an example of that.  Wolf Blitzer finally wanted to just go down the line.  This is, uh, this is when I, I watched this and I'm like, I turned it off and went and, 
[00:54:30]  uh, started watching 30 rock.  I'm like, forget this crap.  I'm not voting again.  These people all suck.  So, uh, well, uh, uh, Wolf Blitzer went down the line to just get a question on the,  uh, the driver license thing for illegal immigrants.  Okay.  And this is what happened.  This is, uh, John Edwards.  Let's go down and get a yes or no from everyone.  Starting with Senator Edwards.  Tell me again what your question is.  Do you, do you, do you support driver's licenses for illegal immigrants?  If we don't have him, uh, comprehensive. 
[00:55:00]  Assuming we don't, in the absence of comprehensive immigration reform, it doesn't look like it's  going to happen anytime soon.  Do you support driver's licenses for illegal?  How easy is that question?  It's a yes or no question.  Of course it is.  And this is why I can't vote.  Legal immigrants.  No, but I don't accept the proposition that we're not going to have comprehensive immigration  reform.  What I do support and what I will do as president of the United States is move this country toward  comprehensive immigration reform.  And anyone who's on the path to earning American citizenship should be able to have a driver's 
[00:55:30]  license.  Wolf Blitzer said yes or no.  No, this is Chris Dodd.  Senator Dodd.  Well, it's, it's important to put in context.  It's obviously, look, clarity is important here.  The American people.  Yeah, clarity is important.  Yes, yes or no.  Yes or no would be clear.  That would be clarity, dummy.  The American people in a debate like this want clarity here.  And certainly the whole idea of getting immigration reform, something I strongly support.  But I believe part of our job is to discourage those who want to come and understand why they 
[00:56:00]  want to come.  Yes or no.  Serious problems.  Four to five hundred thousand.  So is that a yes or no?  No, my belief is that giving a driver, as I've said from the very beginning here, I think  drivers like this are the wrong thing to be doing in terms of attracting people to come  here as undocumented.  Thank you.  What?  That was a no, but this was after they discussed the whole issue, by the way, undocumented.  What?  This was this was after they discussed the issue.  So then he's like, all right, let's just go down the line.  Yes or no.  Yeah.  And they all had this long winded babble. 
[00:56:30]  Do you know how how much you'd stand out if you were just one of those guys that answered  questions?  Like, literally, you just said, no, I'm not for it.  Mm hmm.  Here's Barack Obama.  Senator Obama.  Yes or no?  Yes.  Yes.  OK.  I am going to be fighting for comprehensive immigration reform, and we shouldn't pose the  question that somehow we can't achieve that.  I believe that the American people desperately want it.  That's what I'm going to be fighting for.  Senator Clinton.  No.  And that's all she said, by the way. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, good for her.  Oh, OK, good.  She actually said no.  Well, that's only after Spitzer backed off.  It's the first time she's actually answered it straight.  But what's the matter?  You finally put on the fat fat leg pantsuit, and it's more comfy than the fat calves showing.  She should wear sandwich boards wherever she walks to hide those fat calves.  She makes me sick.  She makes me sick to my core.  And then the kitchen guy answered it this way.  I call him the kitchen guy.  Yeah.  What's his name?  Kucinich.  Yeah.  I call him the kitchen guy.  Naga, Naga. 
[00:57:30]  Naga and be president.  Congressman Kucinich.  I take issue with your description of people being illegal immigrants.  There aren't any illegal human beings.  That's number one.  Shut up.  Shut your mouth.  A trap door should open on him.  He should just fall off the stage.  And the Benny Hill music should stop.  Yeah.  I take issue.  What a politically correct douche.  Douche.  Oh, absolutely.  What a grandstanding douche.  Illegal. 
[00:58:00]  There are no...  What he's doing, he knows exactly what Wolf is saying.  It's just...  You are an illegal immigrant.  You're illegally in this country.  Yes.  You are illegal.  No one said, hey, those invalid human beings, do you support...  And he knows that.  Unbelievable.  So he's trying to grandstand on something that wasn't said.  Mm-hmm.  Do you like jewelry?  Well, I resent knocking the Jews.  No one's knocking the Jews.  Didn't say that.  Yeah.  Congressman Kucinich.  I take issue with your description of people being illegal immigrants.  There aren't any illegal human beings. 
[00:58:30]  That's number one.  Number two, they're undocumented.  And I believe that the best way to do it...  Ah!  I believe the best way to deal with this is cancel NAFTA and renegotiate the trade agreement with Mexico.  Also, let me rephrase the question, Conor.  So the drivers...  If you give people...  Undocumented people in this country, should they be able to get driver's licenses?  You give people a path to legalization, and then they can be legal and have their driver's license.  That's the way to work it.  What about in the absence of comprehensive immigration reform? 
[00:59:00]  You know what?  You give people a path to legalization, and you work to make sure that you don't criminalize their status any further.  And again, I take exception to the way you frame that question.  I hate him.  I take exception.  Man!  And by the way, no, he doesn't.  That's as flaming liberal as you can be with the language.  Yeah.  A self-important, nitpicky douche.  Yeah.  They are illegal.  Of course they are.  No, they came here illegally. 
[00:59:30]  Illegal.  There are no illegal human beings.  You know why they're not documented?  Because they're here illegally.  Right.  Stupid.  Well, there you go.  Oh, I hate that guy.  How can you not?  Hey, by the way, we did have an ak-ak moment last night.  We can't get enough of Hillary Clinton's ak-ak moment.  Hillary's politician speak.  You want to explain the ak-ak to the, yeah.  Oh, it's just, whenever she is trying to make a stupid point, her voice goes from a regular 
[01:00:00]  talking tone, but very monotone.  She's always very monotone.  And as the crowd swells or she gets excited about a point she makes, she has to raise her voice  and change the cadence so it sounds like an alien.  Ak-ak-ak-ak.  Ak-ak-ak-ak.  Ak-ak-ak-ak.  Ak-ak-ak-ak.  Well, we had an ak-ak moment last night.  It just makes me laugh so hard because of Anthony's impression of Hillary.  Mars attacks Hillary.  Listen, it's boring at first.  Like, it's exactly what Anthony just described. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, it's what she does.  Senator Edwards raised health care again.  When Senator Edwards ran in 2004, he wasn't for universal health care.  I'm glad he is now, but for him to be throwing this mud and making these charges,  I think really detracts from what we're trying to do here tonight.  We need to put forth a positive agenda for America.  Telling people what we're going to do.  Senator Edwards, we're going to give you a chance in a second.  Ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak.  Telling people what we're going to do. 
[01:01:00]  Ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak.  Ak-ak-ak-ak.  Ak-ak-ak-ak-ak.  Love the ak-ak moments for me.  I resent them being called illegal.  I resent.  That's what America wants.  Good.  You.  Good.  Just turn the whole country over, stupid.  Give it away.  Change the name because America's dirty.  I'm not going to sit here while you badmouth the United States of America.  It's a nice country we live in.  It's called North Mexico. 
[01:01:30]  Why don't we just change it to that?  Make everybody happy.  Well, not everybody.  I put it to you, Greg.  Right.  We're going to have to take a break in a minute or two here, but let's not forget we're doing our dumb-off next week.  A dumb-off.  We had Rich Voss in here recently, and he showed his stupidity when it comes to answering fifth-grade questions.  Oh, is he adult?  So we decide to have a dumb-off.  It's going to be Robert Kelly, it's going to be Rich Voss, and it's going to be our own Francine.  Francine is dumb as they come. 
[01:02:00]  Oh.  Just a doorknob.  Yeah.  Voss, we all know.  He's great on stage.  He's very funny, but again, just a dolt.  And Bob Kelly, I hear, is offended that we've included him in this, which just shows how stupid Bobby is.  He likes to empower his stupidity by saying that, dude, I love it.  I know I'm stupid.  You don't love it.  You're frustrated by it, and you want to be anything but stupid.  But your lot in life is that you're basically a rock with a body underneath it. 
[01:02:30]  That's what you are.  You're a brick with teeth and eyes that function.  And you know it, and you hate it.  But he empowers himself with it.  Go, no, dude, I like it.  Dude.  He thinks he's like this freedom and his stupidity, but he's not.  It's just what's tortured him his whole life.  Ignorance is bliss, dude.  Dude, get up.  This idiot pontificate, he rehearses what he's going to say.  I caught him doing it because he'll talk and he'll go, you know what, dude, the way to do immigration.  It's like you have actually shirtlessly stood in your apartment and made this speech to no one but your bored dogs. 
[01:03:00]  Just desperately trying to sound like a bright guy.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  And we're going to do the dumb off next Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  And the guys, they took the Rich Voss audio, the mess of audio that he was spewing the other day, and they put this together.  Listen to this.  The History Channel and Jimmy Dean Sausage Links with a grant from the Picket Fence Dental Corporation present 20th Century American History with renowned scholar and member of Mensa, Rich Voss. 
[01:03:30]  I know a lot about it.  Dr. Voss will take you on a breathtaking journey through history's most poignant milestones.  What event took the world to the brink of World War III in 1962?  The Bay of Pigs in Cuba.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no, the Russian Missile Crisis.  Oh, my God.  With every outburst, Rich Voss gets dumber and dumber.  In 1962, what almost brought us to World War III?  It had to be the Bay of Pigs in Cuba when... 
[01:04:00]  No, it's not the Bay of Pigs.  Your head will spin.  It was the U.S. president when World War II ended.  The war ended with the dropping of the atomic bombs.  That didn't actually end World War II.  You've never met a Jew who knows less about World War II than Rich Voss.  What was the World War where Germany was going in, taking, you know, just out of control?  By the way, I've never wanted to punch someone more than you.  Are you talking to me?  Yes.  It's pretty embarrassing when you think about it.  So tune in to 20th century American history and watch in amazement as an old Jewish man goes from mildly coherent to babbling pile of mush in the course of an hour. 
[01:04:30]  You know, you know, it's all history from there.  Coming to the History Channel.  Hey, the guys did a great job with that.  That's funny.  Goddamn Rich Voss.  Yeah.  The dumb off will be Wednesday with Voss, Robert Kelly, and Francine.  All right.  Can't wait.  Huh?  Oh, I hurt my tooth.  What did you do?  Did you hit it? 
[01:05:00]  No, I just banged it.  Oh, no.  You ever, uh...  Mm.  Ow.  What?  No.  Ah!  What?  What happened?  Well, we're going to...  We're going to break soon.  We got our pal Joe Rogan here.  Yes.  Ps-ps-ps-ps-ps-ps-ps-ps-ps-ps.  Ps-ps-ps-ps-ps.  What?  Ps-ps-ps-ps-ps-ps. 
[01:05:30]  Right.  Here.  Communicate with the nose.  Ps-ps-ps-ps.  Here.  Write it down.  Oh.  Write it down.  Oh, I don't know what to do.  There's something going on.  It's very...  Oh, and there's nothing bad.  Oh.  Very important.  Nothing.  Oh, yeah.  Wait, wait, what?  Oh, no, I know.  Okay.  You want me to play this?  Oh, and I'm Kenny, and I love the coffee.  I just thought you forgot.  I didn't forget.  And I'm like, we're going to go to break.  Honestly, I didn't forget.  I was just trying to figure out how to work it in smoothly. 
[01:06:00]  Well, that was pretty smooth.  Right.  That's why I said I hurt my tooth.  Oh, I'm such an idiot.  I figured I would say I hurt my tooth, and you'd play Kenny,  and I got some taffy.  Taffy.  And I had a 10-minute taffy riff.  What was it going to be good?  I'm an idiot.  I was really trying to figure out how to work it in smoothly.  Oh, well.  Well, there you go.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  When we get back, we got Joe Rogan joining the program.  We got a great story about licking toads to get high.  I guarantee he knows something about that.  Yeah. 
[01:06:30]  He knows all the ways to get high.  He's probably moved beyond toads.  Yeah.  He's into, like, turtles and little monsters.  Let me just bomb.  I had a funny reptile place to go, but it was dirty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's my excuse.  I really didn't.  I'm also hearing his Two Girls One Cup reaction video is really funny.  I haven't seen it yet.  We'll talk about that.  We got the real-life Memento guy you brought up earlier in the week, Jimmy.  Oh, that guy's a hoot.  Maybe we could play that.  And we have to play the Jimmy Dean sausage phone call again 
[01:07:00]  before we say, you know, so long to everyone for the weekend.  Adios.  Yeah.  So it's all on the way with us.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Joe Rogan in studio.  What's up, Joe?  What's up, brother?  And Ari, of course.  You guys are playing what?  Caroline's tonight?  Yeah, we're doing a midnight show.  I think it's actually 1230 at Caroline's.  We're crazy.  We go on late.  We don't care.  We don't care. 
[01:07:30]  We don't even care.  We go on sleepy.  Sleepy, yo.  You fly in just now?  No, no.  We got in yesterday.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Do anything fun?  Play pool.  Is your care really low or something?  Maybe I shrunk.  I'm getting old.  There you go.  There we go.  It's kind of creepy, man.  Why?  He could kill somebody with his pinky,  but he's sitting way down low.  I'm looking way down at him.  He's humble.  Hi.  All right.  That was a humble fellow.  You doing anything fun last night?  Play pool.  Nothing.  That's it.  Nothing interesting. 
[01:08:00]  It's kind of boring.  You didn't lick toads or anything?  No.  Oh, yeah.  You were talking about that?  It's 5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine.  That's what it is.  See, I told you.  There's different stuff that comes from frogs  and there's this one, a frog that produces 5-methoxy-DMT  and then there's a toad that produces actually NN-DMT,  which is the real deal.  But the way to get it is to get it from a lab  because you want to make sure that they synthesize it correctly.  I told you.  Of course he does.  What DMT is, it's a human neurotransmitter. 
[01:08:30]  It's the most powerful psychedelic known to man.  Your own brain produces it.  It's actually responsible for dreaming.  When you're in heavy REM sleep  and right at times of extreme stress  when your body thinks it's going to die,  that's when your brain pumps out the most DMT.  And it's responsible for near-death experiences, UFO abductions, all that stuff.  I've done it about seven times.  It's pretty intense.  Oh, yeah, it makes sense.  Near-death, right, man.  Well, yeah, near-death experiences.  And it's responsible for UFO abduction experiences 
[01:09:00]  because the idea is that an endogenous dump of DMT is that it's stored in a pineal gland.  And the pineal gland is literally your third eye.  It's exactly where the third eye is in Eastern mysticism, like right between the two eyebrows.  And it actually has a retina and a cornea and a lens in reptiles.  And it produces DMT.  And DMT, even though it's the most powerful psychedelic drug known to man,  it's in every single ecosystem all over the world.  It exists in plants and grasses and it's everywhere.  I mean, it's really the craziest drug to be illegal everywhere  because everyone's got it in their system. 
[01:09:30]  It's like everyone's holding.  That was like Terrence McKenna's line.  Yeah, and it's pretty intense stuff, man.  If you do it, you will talk to intelligent beings from other dimensions, for real.  I mean, it sounds crazy.  You would think that if there's something like that, that it would be on the front page.  I mean, you look at Barry Bonds on the front page of the Post.  Oh, he lied!  Yeah, yeah.  You know, like, what did you think?  You don't get to be 45 looking like that.  Everybody's going crazy, you know, like, oh, this is ridiculous.  That guy's cheating.  Whatever he's taking, give me it. 
[01:10:00]  All right?  That guy's 45.  He looks like he's 20.  Give it to me, and I'm going to shoot it right in my penis with a turkey baster.  All right?  Yeah, but his head's a little too big.  That looks great.  Whatever.  I have a bigger head.  You get a bigger hat.  You got some money.  Just get a bigger hat?  No.  I'll take it.  Well, I saw the story, and I'm like, I know Joe knows all about this.  Let me just play it out here.  Here it is.  I told you earlier about a man accused of licking a toad to get high.  Well, he's an idiot.  We did some more digging and found out that one of the only places you can get these toads is in Lawrence.  Well, the toad's venom can get you high. 
[01:10:30]  It is also very dangerous, but others insist the toads are just good pets.  They live for 15 years, so you can also build a really good relationship with them.  They're a long-living pet.  They are called the Colorado River Toad, and Persepanes in Lawrence is one of the few places which sells them in the country.  Clay County Prosecutor Dan White says there's a reason you don't see these guys all over.  It could certainly make you sick.  It could kill children or possibly animals in your house, so it's not something you really want to be around. 
[01:11:00]  So, first of all, you don't lick it.  He's an idiot.  They don't know what they're talking about.  You take the toad, and you put it, like, either on glass or on anything, like a windshield or a mirror,  and what you do is you massage the toad, and you get them to excrete whatever they have in their skin,  and that stuff comes onto the glass, and then you scrape it up, and then you smoke it.  You don't lick the toad.  Wait a minute.  Because this is why.  It's because it's not orally active.  See, DMT is not – there's a chemical in your gut called monoamine oxidase, 
[01:11:30]  and you need an MAO inhibitor if you take it orally.  Like, in the Amazon jungle, they figured out how to do this with, like, 450 different –  it's 450,000 different species of plants in the Amazon.  They figured out how to take the root of one, which contains DMT, and the vine from another,  which is an MAO inhibitor.  It's called harmine, and they mix the two of them together.  These Indians figured out how to do this and literally go the other dimensions in the jungle.  That's why those dudes don't want to live.  They don't invent the wheel.  They're not working on nothing in the Amazon.  They don't care. 
[01:12:00]  They don't care at all.  They're just going on DMT trips every day.  Where is – if you have a toad and you want to get the stuff of it, like, how do you –  That's a good question.  I don't know.  His feet or stomach are on the glass.  Is it on his back?  Does it come off of it?  I don't know what part of it.  It comes off of his skin, and you have to massage him.  You could probably dab him on the glass.  But it's not dangerous.  I would bet you dab him.  It's a human neurotransmitter.  It's actually one of the most transient drugs ever exhibited in the body because your body  brings it down to baseline really quickly.  Your body brings it down to baseline in, like, 10 to 15 minutes.  It's really crazy. 
[01:12:30]  What's that mean, down to baseline?  It means, like, say, if you have it, you're high, you go to that dimension,  it just blows out, and then 15 minutes later, you're back normal.  And the crazy thing is it's just like dreams.  You know how you wake up, and you're like, I had the craziest dream.  It was me and my buddy Mike, and we were kids, but we had a sled, and my mom was there.  And then five minutes later, you're like, what the hell was my dream?  Yeah, yeah.  That's exactly what a DMT chip is like.  It's like gold dust slipping through your fingers.  It's very, very intense.  Here's the last part of the story.  But now some people are accused of actually ingesting the toad's venom on purpose. 
[01:13:00]  It acts as a hallucinogenic drug.  We don't discuss that in here.  That's not what we sell them for.  We sell them purely for the pet reason.  But lately, the toad's popularity has picked up.  The store is now selling two or three a week.  Many online, but some to students right here in Lawrence.  So is toad licking, as it's called, become popular among students?  It certainly doesn't seem so.  Toad licking a toad to get high?  I don't know.  I think it's a little absurd. 
[01:13:30]  Sounds dangerous.  It doesn't work that way.  I haven't heard anybody talking about that at all.  Local residents.  It surprised me.  Like, wow, I don't know why.  They could probably get a better drug for the same amount of money.  The crazy thing, you can't get a better drug.  It's the greatest thing ever.  But it's, you know, first of all, it's not orally active.  You can't just do that.  The only way it's going to be orally active is if you take something with it.  And if you take, like, a pharmaceutical MAO inhibitor, you know, you're dead.  You don't even know how that's going to work, you know.  That's very, very, very dangerous. 
[01:14:00]  That sounds...  Because that could, you know, make you open to all sorts of other stuff that you take,  you know, and realize.  He's very knowledgeable.  I'm a psychedelic adventurer.  I'm amazed by his knowledge when it comes to this stuff.  What was the last drug you did?  Uh, I did a weed breast strip about 10 minutes ago.  Weed breast strip?  While we were waiting.  Yeah, you want to see him?  Yeah, I have these breast strips.  He was talking about weed lollipops.  Yeah, I took it to a new level.  These are breast strips.  Check these out.  One of those things will put you on Pluto for five hours. 
[01:14:30]  For real.  It's a pure THC broken down and made into breast strips.  Look, here, pass that to him.  Wow.  Yeah, for real.  Joe's carrying illegal drugs.  Those are illegal, by the way.  Oh, those are legal.  In med strips.  What the hell?  Do they have a smell to them?  Come on.  What does it smell like?  Everybody take it with me.  Let's get this party started.  It smells a little minty.  It'll kick in by the time we go over to the XM show.  It'll be crazy.  Oh, this would be.  Wow, yeah.  It's got some kind of a smell to it. 
[01:15:00]  It's very difficult to tell what it is.  You're just smelling the breast strip.  It's pure THC.  It doesn't have any.  It doesn't smell anything like that.  Dude.  How long does it take?  It takes about a half hour, 45 minutes.  How effed up do you get with this?  Oh, if you're not used to it, if you don't have a THC tolerance, you're doomed.  You're doomed.  You're babbling.  You're in the corner in a fetal position crying about your mommy.  I like it.  It doesn't even say may.  It says keep out of reach of children.  Will cause dizziness.  Will impair driving and the ability to operate machinery. 
[01:15:30]  Everything else is may impair.  It's very, very powerful.  Wow.  How much are they?  Very cheap.  It's like 10 bucks for two of them.  You know?  He's always got something new.  I love it.  Something new, man.  Last time it was the lollipops.  The lollipops are great, too.  You're done with the lollipops, right?  No, I love those.  I got soda.  I got pot soda.  I got everything.  The pot soda's terrible.  It's great.  I love it.  It's the worst tasting of all time.  You're crazy.  I think it's delicious nectar.  For someone who does his share of drugs, you seem very with it. 
[01:16:00]  Very, uh, what's the word I'm looking for?  Coherent.  Well, that, I mean, you-  I don't do drugs to escape.  I don't do drugs to get messed up.  Like, I don't do drugs, like, because I hate life.  I do drugs because I find the state that psychedelic drugs put you in very fascinating and very introspective, and you can learn a lot about yourself, and you can learn a lot about life because it removes you and your ego from the equation.  You get to look at things from, like, a newborn's perspective.  That's why I do it.  I don't do anything, like, I don't do coke or meth or anything dangerous, anything that's addictive. 
[01:16:30]  I have never done coke.  I've never done speed.  I've never done heroin.  I won't do anything that can hurt you.  But psychedelic drugs, those are, they're very different.  This big blanket that we put on everything, we call everything drugs, that's a broad term that encompasses everything from, like, NyQuil to DMT, you know?  I mean, they're all drugs.  I mean, they all affect your consciousness.  It's like, how do they affect your consciousness, though?  I'm not interested in anything that messes me up.  I'm not interested in anything that gives me brain damage or anything that makes me, you know, addicted to it. 
[01:17:00]  I just, I'm only interested in things that can alter my state of consciousness for the better.  That's why.  When you take this stuff, do you sit in a room at your house?  Most of the time, look, when I write, whenever I write, I always get high before I write.  Well, that's obvious.  And when I go in my isolation tank.  All you have to do is see Joe Rogan do a stand-up.  You're like, wow, he goes to a different place to write this stuff.  And I told you many times, I love your stand-up because it's very different than most of the guys out there.  And you'll see for yourself at Caroline's.  Look at that, right into a plug.  But go ahead.  So how long are you in an isolation tank for when you take some time? 
[01:17:30]  A couple hours.  And for people who don't know what the isolation tank is, if you ever saw that movie Altered States,  it's a sensory deprivation tank.  And I have one in my basement.  And what it is, it's filled with water that's like 11 inches tall.  And it's got 800 pounds of salt in it.  And it's heated up.  Of doing stuff.  And you don't want to put anything in your body.  You don't want to abuse anything.  You don't have to.  I mean, you can achieve an altered state of consciousness completely naturally that's not addictive. 
[01:18:00]  It's not dangerous.  And this isolation tank, they have a bunch of them.  There's tank centers.  There's in New York they have them.  There's a place.  If you Google where to float, there's like a website that will tell you.  Where there's these places to go to.  And this tank.  Why the salt water?  Why the salt water?  Because it makes you buoyant.  It makes you float.  Incredibly buoyant.  800 pounds of salt in 11 inches of water.  I mean, it's incredible density.  And you lie in it.  And because it's 93.5 degrees, you can't feel the water.  You don't know what's the water, what's the air.  And once you relax, you get comfortable in the position, you literally feel like you're flying through space. 
[01:18:30]  It's total sensory deprivation.  You don't hear anything.  You don't see anything because you're enclosed in this capsule.  It's black.  Total pitch black.  You don't feel anything because the water is the same temperature as the surface of your skin.  There's no sensory input.  And the absence of sensory input, your brain becomes like supercharged.  It's insane.  It's incredible.  It's literally like the first 20 minutes is like going on a seminar on your life.  It's like it starts showing you all these things that are bothering you.  And you're subconscious and you have a chance to like think about them and rationalize them and trying to figure out where to put them in. 
[01:19:00]  And then once you get more comfortable with the experience, then you kind of cease to be you.  Then you sort of become like one with everything.  And it gets very trippy.  And that's when the hallucinations come and the visions.  How long are you saying?  I go in for hours.  I go in about usually about three times a week is what I like to do.  And I go in for about two hours.  All right.  I'm a beginner.  And I'm going to do this next week.  How long should I go for?  An hour.  An hour is fine.  And you do it.  It's very relaxing too. 
[01:19:30]  You get out.  You feel great.  You feel refreshed.  There's no like no, you know, come down time.  Like you.  And if you ever feel freaked out, like, oh, this is creeping me out.  You pop open the top and you're done.  Well, don't you.  I'm sorry.  Just one question.  What if you itch?  Well, that's the thing.  See, you're going to get a little weirded out when you first get into it because there's  a reaction that your body has when you're not moving at all.  Because you lie in this thing and you stop moving.  And your brain just gives you busy work.  Like, hey, your nose is itching you, dude.  Come on.  I'm going to catch it. 
[01:20:00]  But really, your nose isn't itching you.  Your nervous system is just freaking out that you're not moving.  You're not doing anything.  So you have to do it like three or four times to get really comfortable with the experience.  My good friend, Brother Weiss from Rochester, he was huge into floating.  I don't know if he's still doing it.  It's amazing that people don't know about it.  He would talk about it on his radio show all the time.  He has a tank?  Weiss has a tank?  No, I think there was a center up there.  It's been a while that I've talked to him about it, so I'm not really sure where he's  at.  It's so good for everyone.  It's so relaxing.  It gives you an introspective and objective point of view on your life that you can't get 
[01:20:30]  anywhere else.  It's an environment that doesn't exist anywhere else on the planet.  It's amazing.  You should sell these things.  You're a great salesman for these things.  I want to go to one.  I want to go in one.  I want a tank for Christmas.  Well, Joe and I were corresponding there for a while, and he was giving me info on these  tanks.  I was going to get one of these.  You should get one.  You should do it.  I got a new place with a room.  I don't know what to do.  You got a room.  You don't know what to do with it?  That's it.  Dude, fill it up, man.  Fill it up.  Can it support all that weight with all that water?  If it can support a water bed, it can support a nice place. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, I'll have to ask my building.  Oh, dude, yeah.  Because I've been thinking of turning it into some kind of, you're going to laugh, like  a meditation slash reading slash...  That is what it is.  I have a couch set up, and I put a laptop in there in case I have crazy ideas.  I come out, and I ride them right away.  You got to wash off, though, because you're covered in salt.  You have white all over your body.  Do you feel bloated when you're done?  Wah, wah, wah.  Like you've had too much sushi.  But wait, yeah, a laptop.  That's pretty cool, man.  I like that.  Yeah, I have a room downstairs that's set up. 
[01:21:30]  It's just this room that I trip out in, you know?  How long after you get in the tank do you start tripping out?  About, for me, 15, 20 minutes, because I'm so used to it.  I've done it so many times that my body just knows, here we go.  And I just plug in.  So how do you know when it's time to leave the tank?  Sometimes I just stay in there for a long time.  John Lilly used to...  He set up a...  John Lilly is the guy who created the tank.  He's also a pioneer of interspecies communication.  He used to take acid and trip and talk to dolphins. 
[01:22:00]  And literally figured out like a gang of things about dolphin communication and language from  tripping acid and communicating with dolphins in an isolation tank.  He put an isolation tank right next to this aquarium where these dolphins were living.  And he would communicate with the dolphins while he was in the tank.  But he figured out a way, a system, so he could defecate and urinate while he was inside  this tank.  So he could stay in there for like, you know, 10, 15 hours at a time.  Wow, that's kind of...  Oof.  Yeah, that's a little...  How would he take care of it? 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  Especially...  It's a filtration system somehow.  Doesn't your skin get waterlogged though?  Two men in a tank.  But, you know, it doesn't really hurt you.  But there's another question.  Yeah, but all right.  But so you go into your tank and you're very relaxed.  Do you have like a system where like some kind of alarm that goes off knowing that you've  been in there an hour or two?  Whatever it is.  Well, if I do it, sometimes I know.  Like, say if I have a set at like 9.30 at the Improv or something like that, and  I know I get in at like 6.  I got to get in by 6.  If I get in at 6.30, it could get wacky.  You know, I might be in there for like three hours and I might be late for my set. 
[01:23:00]  You really stay in that long, man.  Wow.  Yeah.  Oh, like two hours.  I like two hours.  I like to go in there right before jiu-jitsu.  I go in there like and think about...  I can go and do jiu-jitsu in my head when I'm in the tank.  It's an unbelievable experience.  You ever go in there on drugs?  Yeah.  Mostly pot.  Mostly pot.  But mushrooms too, yeah.  You ever go in totally sober though?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Totally sober is fine.  Totally sober is a psychedelic experience in itself.  I mean, you don't need to do anything.  I'm going to float next week. 
[01:23:30]  It's amazing, man.  Do they have places in Manhattan?  Absolutely.  All right, I'm going to check it out.  It takes a few...  A lot of them are like spas and stuff.  They'll have them.  But it takes a few times to really get relaxed.  And a lot of people that are using them in these spas, they don't really know what it  does.  They think, oh, it's relaxation.  It's wonderful.  And it is relaxing.  But it's also a very intense experience because in the absence of sensory  input, you'd be amazed at how powerful your brain is.  It's like, say if we're having this conversation, say if you're talking to somebody, you've  got a really important thing you're talking to them about, but there's this guy next to  you and he's screaming and yelling. 
[01:24:00]  Like we were at dinner last night.  Remember those people at dinner last night, Ari?  Yeah.  Where the guy was trying to talk to us.  The waiter was trying to talk to us and there's this guy, I played soccer when I was 18.  He still thinks he's 18.  And they were so loud.  She was disgusting and they were drunk and it was really loud.  And it was so hard to hear the guy talking.  I couldn't listen to the waiter because I was so distracted.  Well, you're constantly computing distance and social cues and space and you're constantly  thinking about where you are.  And in the absence of all that, your brain becomes a very different thing than it is 
[01:24:30]  when you're moving around in regular life.  It's not normal to separate your brain from sensory input.  When you do, you go into these insane visions.  And a lot of people believe it brings you closer to source.  It brings you closer to what human beings really are.  In absence of your body, in absence of culture and tradition, all the things you've learned,  what you are is like a soul or an energy or a thing.  And it tunes you into whatever that is.  It feels like Kane from Kung Fu.  No kidding.  Just wanders the earth. 
[01:25:00]  But he does study this stuff.  He can kick ass.  Well, it's just fascinating stuff.  And then he just, he's very philosophical.  This wasn't a quick Google on his part.  He's been studying this for a long time.  Well, I've been doing, I've been.  He's gotten deep into this stuff.  Gets out of the tank and just can drive a salty foot right into someone's mouth.  Yeah.  I've been, I've been doing this for about nine years now.  Imagine if he wasn't doing all this stuff to relax his soul.  I know.  He would be just killing people all day long.  Well, I have very bad genetics.  You know, if I wasn't doing martial arts and stuff, I think a lot of people that are in 
[01:25:30]  prison, a lot of people that are in bad places in life, they have bad genetics, you know,  a bad environment and bad genetics makes a violent person.  But all that's just energy, you know, if you figure out a way to channel it.  Now we've got a ton of people that are just asking more about this floating.  Where, where do they float?  Go to Google, where to float and put it in Google.  And there's a website that will show you all over the world, different websites or different  places where you can go.  All right.  Different cities, different, there's a lot of, and you might have to drive a couple hours. 
[01:26:00]  Trust me, it's worth it.  And everybody listening in New York, stay away from all the places where you can float  in New York because I want to do it next week.  I'm sure you could probably get in.  That's the amazing thing is it's not hard to, it's not like, you know, everyone, you  know, it's like there's yoga classes and Pilates classes and they're packed up and you got  to, you know, book in advance, but nobody knows about this.  You like the yoga?  Yeah, I love yoga.  Yeah, I'm starting to get into that.  A little bit, a little bit.  It's hard to do, man.  It sounds so faggy, like, oh, I'm taking a yoga class.  Oh, why don't you just go blow, guy?  Can I say that?  Cut that out. 
[01:26:30]  You know, I've worked out my whole life, like yourself, I always try to stay in shape  with all sorts of different, like, classes and weights and stuff.  And I started doing yoga a little bit, not a lot yet.  And it's brutal how hard it is.  If you're doing it right, especially.  Yeah, and you see some little 90-pound Chinese chick and she's doing it.  She's just rocking.  You're pouring sweat.  You're like, what the hell?  Just by getting in a position and holding it, you're sweating like you've never sweated  before. 
[01:27:00]  What about the farts, though?  Oh, yeah.  That comes out.  The whole room is just nothing but the symphony of fart.  Really?  I don't know why, but yeah.  Especially if you don't eat right.  If you're not eating healthy.  Do you find that you break more when doing Warrior One?  And a lot of times I find that what I'm doing downward dog, I don't fart as much.  But Warrior One, yeah, well.  All right, we've got to take a quick break.  We've got Ari, of course, and Joe Rogan here.  Tonight at Caroline's at 1230.  Really, really great show.  1230 or 1230?  Okay, 1230.  Show up at 12 and just cause noise. 
[01:27:30]  Joe's stand-up is very, very funny and very, very interesting.  I'll say that every time you're in here.  Well, thank you, man.  I appreciate that.  First time I saw him at the Comedy Store in L.A., I was blown away.  I had no idea because I just knew you at the time from being a whore.  I've done too many things for money.  I've confused a lot of people.  A lot of people don't even know I'm a comedian.  I'd say like 80% of the people know who I am.  Go, what?  You do comedy?  It's very interesting and clever comedy, and I love that about you.  All right, more with Joe Rogan next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Joe Rogan in studio playing Caroline's tonight with his buddy, his pal, who's also very funny, 
[01:28:00]  Ari.  1230 tonight at Caroline's.  You can see Ari's butthole.  Can I say that?  On my website, you've got to see this video.  It's insane.  If you go to JoeRogan.net, Ari had some...  Hold on.  How about you say the same exact thing but kind of keep it very kind of vague to the  point people understand what you're saying?  Ari has a very interesting bottom.  Bottom.  It's a very long story. 
[01:28:30]  It's all explained on JoeRogan.net, but there's a video that my employee...  I have a video employee, a guy who takes videos from me from the internet.  Ari was going number two in a green room in Austin, Texas.  You ever do Cap City Comedy Club?  I have not, no.  Great place.  Great place.  Anyway, Ari was doing number two, and he flashed his buttocks to my friend, and apparently  he got some problems down there.  I was trying to push one out in like 10 minutes.  We got video.  It's just no excuses, my friend. 
[01:29:00]  You got a real issue.  And if you go there, it's very shocking.  It's a very shocking little...  Can we see it?  It's too much...  You should go to the website and see it.  Just go to JoeRogan.net.  Because it's healed up.  JoeRogan.net.  I have a feeling they might have dumped out a little too much description, but let's  just put it this way.  It's a very good video of Ari who's sitting on our couch.  Is your hiney a mess just to say that?  Is it a problem?  I would say yes.  When I was younger, I had hemorrhoids.  Can I say that?  I don't know.  There's very few hineys that I could pick out in a lineup.  I could pick out Ari's.  Let's put it that way.  All right.  You'd go, oh, there it is.  Jesus.  Also, people are talking about your two girls, one cup reaction video. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  What makes yours different?  Well, it's kind of funny.  And then on top of that, I also showed my employee who showed me two girls, one cup.  I showed him the BME Pain Olympics.  Have you ever seen that?  No.  Yeah.  Body Modification Extreme is a website.  And these guys, like a lot of them, they call themselves nulos.  Like they nullify themselves.  They chop it off.  And this video is all about that.  It's all hatchets and fillet knives.  And you just stop it. 
[01:30:00]  Why do they do that?  Because they're broken.  They're damaged.  Broken.  You've got to get off.  They're broken.  Oh, man.  I can't even listen to that.  Well, you know, a lot of people have a problem with their sexuality.  You know, Nikola Tesla destroyed his sexuality.  That's like a quote from his biography, that he destroyed his sexuality.  And somehow, he was very, Nikola Tesla's like the greatest inventor ever.  Yeah.  He invented alternating current.  He invented like hundreds of different things.  And, you know, Westinghouse and a lot of these big companies just totally ripped this guy off.  He died broke. 
[01:30:30]  And, you know, the government came in when he died.  He lived in New York.  And they just came in and just took all of his notes and all of his information.  But he created the Tesla coil and alternating current and all sorts of amazing inventions.  And he was a crazy, crazy dude.  And he said that he was getting all of his information from aliens.  That's the thing.  He believed that he was tuning in to aliens.  And they were communicating with him and giving him his information.  Yeah, he was supposedly making death rays and force fields and things like that.  Well, he created a way to broadcast electricity for free.  And when Westinghouse found out what he was doing, they closed down the project. 
[01:31:00]  But he figured out a way to send electricity, like radio, through the air.  And anyone would just be able to tune in electricity.  And they were like, oh, we can't make money off that.  What are you doing, stupid?  And they yanked it.  I mean, that's one of the reasons why it's not in today is because they have never figured out how to make money off of it.  But they can broadcast electricity.  I mean, it's really, really crazy stuff.  I hate to walk through that stream.  Yeah, whoops.  But Tesla, he was very distracted.  There are a lot of people that believe aliens or whatever, people from another life form help you out with like- 
[01:31:30]  It's probably DMT.  With your creative mind and, you know, as far as inventing stuff and things like that.  This DMT stuff, if you take DMT, you will communicate with something.  And it's so beyond description that me talking about it is like trying to explain a kaleidoscope to a blind man.  I mean, it just doesn't make sense.  Like, there's no way you could explain it.  I mean, it's just so beyond anything you can explain.  But something communicates with you when you do this stuff.  Let's go to Lee in the Bronx.  Lee!  Yeah.  Come on, Lee. 
[01:32:00]  Let's go.  We're having a good discussion.  Get out of your tank.  You're in the ball.  I was watching YouTube yesterday, searching for the DMT.  And I browsed around Joe Rogan.  I got interested in stuff.  And I kept on getting into it.  And I found a video of a young lady.  She was giving a tutorial on how to extract the toes.  The toes are the DMT.  Right.  Wow.  She has a different method on how to, like, the way she did it was she did it anally. 
[01:32:30]  Just search that way.  She did it.  Oh.  Oh, she put it there.  Yeah.  Well, if you do that, I guess, you know, that goes directly into the bloodstream.  I mean, that's why people sniff cocaine, right?  Because it goes directly through your nose into your bloodstream.  Right.  Let's say hi to Kevin in Buffalo listening.  Yeah, he just wrecked our trip, man.  See, that's the problem with drugs is the people that do them.  It's like that's what I say.  The problem with pot is the pot propaganda is so powerful that there's only two types of people that get into pot. 
[01:33:00]  People who were informed and who read about the propaganda go, wait a minute.  This doesn't make any sense.  All these government and university studies and medical studies show that it doesn't do any harm.  Why is it illegal?  And they start looking into it.  Then they find out the history of it.  And then they have some friends and say it enhances your creativity.  And they try it.  So there's that group.  And then there's people that, I just want to get effed up, man.  And they know about the propaganda.  They don't care if it gives you brain damage.  They don't care.  And those are the types of people that are the problem because that's the stereotypical pot drug user. 
[01:33:30]  Right on.  Let's say hi to Kevin in Buffalo listening on The Edge.  Kevin, what's up?  What's up, man?  Hey.  I was wondering if you guys are going to have a contest, win a trip with Joe Rogan.  I don't want to be responsible.  God, what a great idea.  That is a good idea.  If we could get that done through the lawyers, how great would that be?  Oh, through the lawyers, yeah.  We'd have to do a contest.  We'd have to go to Brazil.  Yeah, we could have a contest where you get to win a trip with Joe Rogan.  Where are we going?  Nowhere, really.  We're going to a totally different place, my friend. 
[01:34:00]  It ain't Maui.  You don't need a plane for where we're going.  You don't need a passport either.  Let's say hi to Roger in Queens.  Roger.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Before you guys go into another subject, I wanted to share my experience of something  that I had once smoked.  I did some research while I was in college, and I found this drug called Salvia.  Did you ever hear about that stuff?  Yeah, I've done Salvia.  Salvia divinorum.  Yeah.  Of course.  At the time, apparently, it was completely legal. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, it's legal now still.  You can get it at head shops.  You can order it online.  It's only going to be legal in 2008 in Chicago or in Illinois.  That's the first state to make it illegal.  That's exciting.  What is it about?  Salvia is a naturally occurring psychedelic that they missed during the – the reason  why psychedelic drugs are illegal, there's a bunch of them that aren't even active in  human beings.  They were made illegal during the LSD craze in the 1970s because they realized that LSD  was having a very profound effect on culture, very profound – it's very difficult to sneak  political debates by people who've done acid because they're just like, what? 
[01:35:00]  No, this is stupid.  This is a lie.  And it's impossible to program them.  I mean, that's the real problem with psychedelic drugs.  And Salvia was one that they missed.  There's a few that they missed.  5-methoxy DMT is still legal.  And it's unbelievably powerful.  5-methoxy DMT they found out about because the Army Research Labs in the 1960s – it's  one of the ways – Terrence McKenna found it – was one of the guys that he went to  college with was working for the Army back in the day.  And they had like a huge – like a barrel full of this stuff. 
[01:35:30]  And it's the most unbelievably potent psychedelic drug.  And the Army was experimenting with it.  And as soon as they found out about what it does, they're like, nope, illegal, stop.  It's amazing that people don't know about it.  I mean, it's the most incredible experience.  I mean, we are such like an experience-obsessed society.  I mean, everybody wants to go whitewater rafting and people want to talk about, you know,  my uncle climbed Mount Everest.  It's all about experiences.  We all want to ride roller coasters and see the craziest movies.  There is a little powder. 
[01:36:00]  And you smoke this little powder, and it will change the way you look at everything.  You won't care about UFOs.  If a UFO landed right out there, I'd be like, wow, yeah, they're probably from another planet.  Whatever.  It's not DMT.  DMT is 100,000 times crazier than that.  It's like mushrooms times a million plus aliens.  That's what it's like.  And literally, I mean, it sounds – it's crazier than you could possibly imagine or describe.  My words do it no justice.  You would take it on a plane?  No.  It's not something – it's not recreational. 
[01:36:30]  And it's not something you could take on a plane because you have to smoke it.  You know, and you wouldn't want to be around people and noises or anything.  You'd want to be in total darkness and silence.  And you want to just experience that.  Can you have bad trips on DMT?  Sure.  You can have bad trips on anything.  But bad trips are usually you trying to resist and your ego trying to control the situation.  And you realizing what a piece of poo you really are.  You know, like your ego protects you from a lot of your, you know, terrible behavior.  And, you know, it justifies a lot of things you do. 
[01:37:00]  But, man, when mushrooms or DMT or anything that removes the ego, it just shows you what your life is really like and who you really are.  That's where the bad trips come from.  Bad trips don't come from happy people with wonderful lives or loving families or nice to everybody.  Bad trips come from people who are doing bad things or they're insecure or they have real bad problems in their past that they're squashing and they're not dealing with.  And then it just, wham, just comes right up to the surface.  You're going to be a messiah someday.  You know that.  You're going to have a following.  It's kind of creepy, man.  The government's going to come in and kill you. 
[01:37:30]  They're probably already watching.  But set his compound on fire.  I've been wanting a compound for years.  This might be a little hack.  It might be a little hack.  But do you believe in aliens?  There's certainly something other than us.  It doesn't make any sense.  If you look, there's 100 billion stars in this galaxy.  Yeah, I just threw the math in my head.  There's 100 billion galaxies in the known universe.  Absolutely.  It has to be something.  But what we have to consider is that biological life on this planet is dictated by our gravity.  It's dictated by the distance from the planet from the sun.  It's dictated by how much water we have on our planet. 
[01:38:00]  There's no telling that there's not some sort of a different kind of life.  It's very possible that there are billions of infinite different types of life that we just don't understand it.  And it might not even be detectable to us.  It's like the way I describe it is like the fart.  He's sitting around wallowing this.  We can detect a fart because he can smell you. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, gee, what the hell?  Who did it?  Who did it?  And you go crazy.  But there could be something around us all the time.  Oh, that's creepy, man.  We just don't have the senses to pick it up.  There could be an infinite amount of possibilities of all sorts of different experiences and things that are around us all the time.  As humans, we're just pompous to begin with.  We think it just has to be our way and that's it.  And there's no other things or anything else going on.  Well, we shield ourselves from that because the real reality is, like, look, just stare up at space. 
[01:39:00]  I mean, everybody wants to talk about Britney Spears.  Should you take your kids away?  We're in a rock flying through the universe.  And it rarely comes up.  You know, everyone wants to talk about Barry Bonds.  And above you is the craziest thing you could ever look at ever.  And people take, like, road trips to go to Niagara Falls.  We've got to go.  We've got to go to see those.  Waterfall's amazing.  There's nothing more amazing than space, but nobody looks at it because it's too crazy.  The idea that above you is infinite.  You can't see much.  That's the problem.  It's like space, they all look the same.  At least Niagara Falls, there's some water. 
[01:39:30]  You can go to a gift shop.  What are you going to do?  Just, you know, get in a car and ride to the moon and then die because you can't breathe?  He brings up a really good point, though, because when you're out in the wilderness where you're away from city lights and you do look up in the sky,  you can only do it for a few minutes.  And then you start to kind of subconsciously get freaked out.  You're very small is what the problem is.  And you're like, all right, let's go to Starbucks or let's go eat.  Like, you want to get back to, like, just what you know.  Especially if you're pink.  I mean nothing.  I mean nothing.  He's right.  You're part of everything.  You don't really mean nothing.  You mean everything. 
[01:40:00]  But you are everything.  You know, it's like a suit.  It's just our own biology tricks us into thinking that we're important because that's the only way to stay alive.  If you really were intelligent enough to rationalize your real position in this whole thing,  you would be so humbled by it that you wouldn't really have any ambition.  You wouldn't want to keep going.  You wouldn't want to get laid.  You really wouldn't want to do anything because you'd see how pointless it is.  It would be really silly.  But your biology and your ego shields you from all that and go,  you're a winner, Trump.  You go out there and get those buildings and build that mansion and fly that jet. 
[01:40:30]  Look at me.  Look at that watch, son.  You can afford that watch.  Get that car and drive.  Look at everybody.  Envy me.  But really, you're just flying through space.  On a rocket.  You know, you're just the head monkey with the brightest fur, you know?  At the mercy of whatever cataclysm might be around the corner.  Oh, for sure around the corner.  You ever watch one of those documentaries on Yellowstone, how ready that thing is to blow?  Yep.  Every 600,000 years, a caldera volcano that's just the base of it is 600 kilometers wide. 
[01:41:00]  They didn't even know it was a volcano until they saw it from a satellite.  It blows every 600,000 years, and it kills everything in North America.  It happened 600,000 years ago.  It was the last blow.  And it's rising at like a steady pace, like at record levels.  It's going to go.  And if that doesn't go, there's 100,000 near-Earth objects flying through our solar system that  are like, you know, five miles long, solid rock.  Just ready.  Just constantly crossing our orbit.  We just don't have to be there at the right time.  How many parties have you emptied out?  Yeah.  But I'm a happy person. 
[01:41:30]  I like to have fun.  These things, it's like if you've had enough of these experiences, you know, well, what  is life?  Well, life should be a bunch of positive experiences.  It should be a lot of fun.  You know?  So that's what comedy is.  I mean, comedy is like spreading fun.  It's spreading love, spreading happiness.  You know?  You go on stage, and everybody has a good time.  You say, thanks for coming out.  Everybody cheers.  You have fun.  It's a positive experience.  You know, and that's all you have in life, really, is positive experiences with your  girlfriend, your family, your friends, your buddies.  That's really all life is.  You know what sucks?  We're lucky enough to, you know, have a life, you know? 
[01:42:00]  And you'll live your whole life not knowing anything.  Yeah.  When it comes down to, like, looking up at the stars, like, what is all that?  Is there other life forms?  Is there other things just around you?  Yeah.  We never will get the answers to any of that stuff.  That's the craziest thing about DMT, because DMT is literally like having a meeting with God.  It's like having a meeting with divine, unbelievably wise, incredibly loving energy, like whatever  it is, the source of everything.  And it leaves you so humbled that after it's over, you have a, it's literally like you're 
[01:42:30]  still you.  You still look like you.  You still wear the same clothes you are, but you're not really you anymore.  I mean, you literally have been changed.  You know, you have experienced something that very few humans experience.  And the thought to me that people can go through their entire lives and not know about  this is an incredible waste of time.  It's like your life could be so much more positive and so much more interesting and fascinating.  And you would be so much more humble and aware of what you really are and where you  really stand if you just have this experience.  Can you get this drug at Dwayne Reed? 
[01:43:00]  Totally illegal.  At Dwayne Reed?  It should be.  Well, you know, that's the crazy thing is you can get alcohol everywhere.  You can go to Dwayne Reed and buy a jug of wine and get effed up.  Yeah.  I mean, we have drugs that are available.  I mean, how many times you talk to a girl, oh, I don't need drugs.  I mean, you know what?  She's hammered, smoking a cigarette.  You know what I mean?  Everybody, there's drugs, caffeine.  I mean, I'm drinking a coffee right now.  It's just, it's sanctioned.  It's a sanctioned drug because it's great for capitalism.  It keeps you going.  It keeps you working.  But there's, you know, there's drugs out there that are actually good for you. 
[01:43:30]  There's drugs out there that are actually good for your mind.  And they're probably an important part of human evolution.  You know, Terrence McKenna believed that psilocybin and psilocybin mushrooms are the very  reason for human evolution in the first place, the reason why we evolved from the lower hominids.  He believes that the change in the atmosphere made these monkeys come down off the trees  and start experimenting with new foods.  And one of the things they experimented was eating things that grow on cow pies and eating  these mushrooms.  And it's also one of the reasons why in so many different religions, cows are holy. 
[01:44:00]  You know, in Choctaw, heook, which is like one of the oldest known civilizations, they  all worship cows.  It was a really complicated, really advanced civilization from 5,000, 6,000 years ago.  And it was all about cattle worship.  And that's because that's where the mushrooms came from.  Can I stop you for a second?  I think the monkeys' minds were expanded by mushrooms.  Absolutely.  Well, you know what?  It's hysterical.  The growth of the human brain, this is a real, the stoned ape theory is McKenna's theory,  but the growth of the human brain, the human brain doubled in brain size in 2 million years.  And it's the biggest mystery without question, without contest, in the entire fossil record. 
[01:44:30]  And this is evolutionary biologists all agree on this.  It's something they don't understand.  Within 2 million years, the human brain doubled.  That's insane.  I think I know why, though.  Because for a long time, they were probably just walking up to tigers and just slapping  them.  And something in the species said, this is not working.  We better get smarter.  We've got to try another way, right?  Well, it's funny that you say that, because you know what?  We have genetic memory.  I mean, that's another point.  Like this guy, Rupert Sheldrake, wrote about this, that children, when they grow up in New  York City, they're not afraid of child molesters or clowns or muggers. 
[01:45:00]  They're afraid of scary monsters.  Everyone's afraid of scary monsters.  And what that is, is those leftover memories of people getting jacked by cougars, you know,  and mountain lions and jaguars.  I mean, because that's what our enemies were when we were living in the trees, you know?  That's why chimps live in the...  That's why, like, when you're in a house, the master bedroom's always upstairs.  That's all leftover stuff from the chimp days, when we had to get the little skinny branches  to hide from the big cats.  That's all that stuff that's in your memory.  I thought it was just you didn't want your guests rummaging through your bedroom.  No, it's a fort. 
[01:45:30]  You want to keep the animals from coming up.  I want to be able to fight them from the top.  High ground.  I want to go back to the cow thing, because, like, we all heard about how, you know, civilizations,  like, worship the cow.  Yeah.  And the Irish person, meaning just about everybody listening right now, goes, stupid people  worshiping cows, instead of maybe, like, trying to figure out where that came from and  if there is something that makes sense about that.  It totally makes sense.  Yeah, but to me, I'm like, what idiots?  Well, psilocybin grows much more easily on cow manure than, much more easily on manure, 
[01:46:00]  on, you know, when animals, vegetables and, you know, a plant, when it gets pumped through  the double stomach of these cows, it makes it very easy for spores to grow on these things.  Yeah.  So it's very common for mushrooms to grow on cow dung.  And if you were a primitive man and you had no access to science, you didn't understand  what spores were, you can't, you don't have a microscope, you would know that these cows  produce something which made the most beautiful experience possible, made your ego dissolve, 
[01:46:30]  made you think of everyone as being one, made you love everyone, make you completely  humble, make you really spiritual and holy, and it's coming out of this cow's butt.  You know, you would worship that cow.  You wouldn't think of it as like, oh, it's stinky cow poo.  You'd be like, no, that's God.  That's the source of God.  You pluck that out and you eat it and it blows your mind.  A bit of observation here, of an observation.  I'm looking at instant feedback.  People are saying Joe Rogan is the only guest where you need to Google the entire time you  listen to him.  People are Googling their asses off right now from names. 
[01:47:00]  The Terrence McKenna stoned ape theory is one of the most fascinating theories I've ever  read about human evolution, and it's all about psychedelics.  All right, let's go to Keith on Long Island.  Keith, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  I love the show, man.  Thanks.  Listen, I got a question.  I understand about the mushrooms and enhancing and all that stuff, but my question is metaphysically.  You know, like, I understand about the planets and how space is so grand and infinite, but 
[01:47:30]  what about, like, when someone dies and they come to you in your dreams?  Is that real?  Is that just your psyche?  That's a real good question, man.  You know, it might be you trying to deal with it in your subconscious.  You know, it might be that there's something, you know, it's very possible that that's where  we go when we die, that that dream state that you have to go to.  You know, we don't, no one understands what dreaming is all about.  No one understands why you have to do it, but you must dream.  If you don't dream, you die.  It's not just a matter of lying down and closing your eyes.  You have to go into REM sleep. 
[01:48:00]  If you don't, when you fall asleep, the reason why people were up for, like, days at a time  and you drive and you, like, instantly fall asleep, you go to sleep like that.  It's like you owe time.  It's like you owe time to the dream state.  You know, it's like, it's very possible that what we think of as consciousness is just one  state of consciousness.  And there's many different states that we go through in the middle of the night that  we're not aware of when we're awake.  And that that consciousness might be more potent, might be more powerful than this consciousness,  the waking consciousness.  We're just arrogant and assuming that this is what life is all about, that the wake is what 
[01:48:30]  is important.  It's not necessarily true.  It's what's important while you're awake, but it might not be what's important.  My dreaming, my dreaming, it's pretty crazy, right?  Yeah, I was just saying, but the dream part isn't the part that will physically, like,  screw you up.  I've had dreams where I've woken up and gone, oh, that was the easiest solution to a problem  I ever had, just opening my eyes.  Because I was in some deep crap about a second ago.  The cops were after me. 
[01:49:00]  I had murdered somebody.  I was totally panicked going, oh, my God, they found the body.  Like, sometimes I have these dreams where the cops will come and knock on the door and  go, do you know about this person?  I'll be like, oh, my God, 10 years ago, I killed someone and buried him.  And, like, they're finding out.  And I'm so screwed.  And then I'll slowly wake up and look around and go, oh, I'm out of trouble.  Just like that.  That was easy.  No lawyers.  Yeah.  No lawyers.  No prison.  That's so true.  No taking it in the shower.  No fake mustaches.  No fake beards. 
[01:49:30]  And it's such a great feeling when it's over.  Yes.  God, you nailed it.  You nailed it.  That's so true.  That's so true.  And that's like the part of the dream where in reality you're like, please get me out of  this.  And sleeping ain't going to help.  You're going to be in jail.  It's totally true.  But that aspect of it, though, the explanation about that is that that aspect of dreaming  where you can recognize it, it seems like regular life, is when the DMT is ebbing from  your consciousness, when it's going away.  When you're in full-blown DMT mode, the craziest thing about DMT is when you do it, it's unbelievable. 
[01:50:00]  You can't imagine yours.  Terrence McKenna's quote was that the only thing you have to fear is death by astonishment.  But you also feel like you've been there.  That's the craziest thing because you are.  You're there every night when you're asleep.  You just don't remember it.  But while that's wearing off, that's when we have these wacky dreams.  That's when we have dreams.  When that stuff is slowly starting to leave your system in the middle of the night or whenever  you're dreaming, it ebbs and flows.  And when it's slowly starting to leave, that's when your cousin has a gun and he comes home 
[01:50:30]  covered in blood and you've got to get him to Mexico.  And you're like, oh, no.  That's where those dreams come from.  I've only done it seven times.  It's not something you do all the time.  I haven't done it in a year.  It's hard to find, right?  It's very hard to find.  And even if you can find it, which I can, I stare at it and go, no, not today.  I've got stuff to do.  I've got to go hang out with my girlfriend's mom.  There's a lot of stuff I've got to do, man.  But it's something that you've got to do and then you need a long time off where you've 
[01:51:00]  got to think about that experience.  We're not talking about getting high.  We're not talking about getting drunk.  Like, oh, dude, I went to a concert.  I got so drunk.  It's a completely life-changing experience and it's not something you should take lightly.  Getting back to dreams, ever since my dad died, I was way close to my dad.  I know a lot of guys are close to their dad, but we had a really special bond.  And I dream about him and at times he hugs me in my dreams. 
[01:51:30]  It is the creepiest, realest thing.  And I've been in a situation in dreams where you hug another person and someone you might  even, maybe your girlfriend or something.  Then they turn into a Vespa.  It's not the same feeling.  It is real.  It is the creepiest feeling where it wakes me that fuck.  I'm like, I can't deal with this.  This is effed up.  That happened to me once.  It just feels so, I can't explain it to anybody, but it just feels so much different than anything  else I've ever dreamed of.  Anything. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  I mean, because I've had friends that have died and, you know, you have a moment in a  dream with a friend or something.  But it's just, you just kind of wake up knowing, ah, that was a dream.  I was just thinking about that guy or whatever in my sleep.  But this, this hug from my dad is, I can't explain it.  Well, maybe it's a love for your dad is like so pure.  It was so, you know, a love for your friends is never going to be the same as a love for  your dad or your mom.  It's just, it's so powerful and pure.  And maybe you can communicate with that when you're in your dream state.  I don't know.  I can't, I can't rationalize it when I'm awake. 
[01:52:30]  It's like every once in a while it happens and it is, it creeps me out to the point I wake  up instantly no matter what.  I had one like that with Phil Hartman.  And I really helped me, um, forget and not, not just forget, but get over his murder.  And, uh, I ran into him in the dream.  I ran into him like in a park and he had the only difference.  He was exactly him, but he looked great.  It was like, he looked like he was like healthy, like he'd been eating right, but he had gray  hair.  It was really strange, but it was him.  Like he was like talking to me and I go, dude, your, your wife killed you. 
[01:53:00]  I like, what, what was this like?  He goes, yeah, she got a little mad.  Uh, and he like starts laughing.  And he goes, listen, sit down.  I'll talk about it.  And he, he pratfalled.  He went to sit in the chair and felt and rolled over and started laughing and because that's  what Phil was like.  He was like always like he would make light of anything and everything.  The guy was really, really funny, like offstage, much funnier than he was onstage.  He was always worried about his image, about being the family man.  He was worried about divorcing this chick because he was really worried about his image and 
[01:53:30]  he was worried about his money and a bunch of other stuff.  But, but offscreen, he was one of the funniest guys I've ever been around ever, but he was  laughing and joking in the dream.  And when I woke up, I was like, wow, it was like, Phil told me, don't worry about it.  Like, that's what it really felt like.  Like, go on with your life.  I'm okay.  Do you hate Andy Dick like, uh, like, uh, Lovitz did?  Like, is he kind of blamed Andy Dick or you did not have that?  No, Andy did.  That chick was crazy.  She was going to shoot him no matter what.  It didn't matter if Andy Dick got her Coke.  She would have got Coke from some other guy.  She was with some guy that night that, you know, got it to her.  I mean, you can get Coke, you know, it means Andy's Andy, you know, it's like, that's like 
[01:54:00]  blaming a child that you give a gun to.  Oh, why'd you shoot somebody?  Yeah.  You know, it's Andy.  I got, I got, I just got to talk about one more dream thing.  Uh, a lot of times I dream it's, they're, they're like sets.  I have set places that I go to over and over, like houses, certain houses, certain places,  cars, things like that.  And, um, uh, few times I'm able to actually in my dream go, holy crap, I'm dreaming.  Like I'm in my dream and I go, I look around and go like something so ridiculous happens 
[01:54:30]  that I go, oh man, I'm dreaming.  Isn't that awesome?  Which is total freedom.  And you know what the first thing I do is?  I go on a rape rampage.  I swear to you, dude, I know I'm dreaming.  I can do whatever I want with impunity.  And I just start the first girl that's even near me, the clothes get ripped off and I just  start like complete rape rampage.  You don't make them consent at all.  You just, you want it against their will.  You don't want them.  You know why?  Cause I want to, cause I know that if I start identifying that it's a dream, I'm very close 
[01:55:00]  to waking up.  Yeah.  So you got to get that over with quickly.  So there's no talking.  There's no going.  There's methods to keep that going.  Yeah.  I've heard about that.  There's books on lucid dreaming.  Lucid dreaming.  One of the things you're supposed to do, you really were raping and then you wake up.  Hey, no, it's a dream officer.  Come on, folks.  Come on.  Ow, this mace really feels authentic.  There's a method that you use that it only worked once on me, but it does work.  Where I was practicing it for a while where I'd walk into a doorway. 
[01:55:30]  I saw it in a documentary.  And you knock on the door and you go, am I awake or am I dreaming?  And you knock on the door and you do it throughout the day.  Like all the time.  Do it so it's like a pattern.  So it's normal.  Well, in my dream, I walked up to a wall and go, am I awake or am I dreaming?  And my hand went right through the wall.  I was like, oh, snap.  I thought I was awake.  I really thought I was awake.  I mean, I was going through a normal life.  So then I started flying.  Flying is all, if rape isn't involved, then flying is a good second best. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, it's awesome.  There's also that you were talking about, you know, am I awake or am I dreaming?  If I'm unsure in a dream, all I have to do, and it's a weird thing, I have to look  out a window in utter terror, and if the most horrific being thing appears on the other  side coming to get me, I'll know I'm dreaming.  But then it's so screwed up because I just created this beast that's now going to be chasing  me throughout the rest of the dream.  That's one way to do it.  You know how I know?  I'll take my clothes off and stand in a mirror, and if I feel good about myself, I know I'm 
[01:56:30]  asleep.  Hey, Joe, you ever feel like you left your body?  Yeah, Salvia.  Salvia did that for me.  I, once as a kid, I felt like I absolutely left my body while I was sleeping and went  into the bathroom just to do whatever.  Yeah.  But I remember it to this day, like, I truly felt like I wasn't going to, walking to the  bathroom physically.  It was the weirdest, it only happened once, and that's something I always go back to from 
[01:57:00]  time to time as well.  I had a weird dream that I remember from when I was, I was like four or five years old, where  I was cross-legged, like, sitting like an Indian or like a yoga guy, and I was flying  through my hallway.  And I don't remember any other dreams from this time, but I remember that dream, that  one dream of, like, flying around, like, outside of your body.  Who knows what kids are more tuned into?  Kids are less programmed, you know?  I remember a couple patterns.  I remember dreams from when I was really young, too, but only a couple. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  You know, when you were really young.  And then, like, this many years later, and you remember it?  Yeah.  Why that one?  That's really odd.  But at that time, I really felt like something was way different.  I can't explain it.  But did it happen while you were asleep?  I was definitely asleep.  It was the middle of the night, and it could have easily been me dreaming that I'm walking  to the bathroom, but I truly felt like I was actually walking to the bathroom without  my body.  Well, this experience that we have while we're in heavy REM sleep, they believe is also responsible  for alien abductions, because no aliens come to people when it's, like, 9 o'clock in the 
[01:58:00]  morning, you know, Manhattan, you're on your way to work, you're walking down the street,  you see a UFO.  That's not when it happens.  Right, right.  It happens when you're asleep, over and over and over again, and they believe that this  is the same thing, that this incredibly real experience.  You're like, no, I'm telling you, it happened.  They came into my house, and you think of it as a physical thing.  It's all going on.  It's the same thing as this crazy dream of you being out of your body.  There's all sorts of states of consciousness that we go into in the middle of the night.  We've got to take a quick break.  God, this is really, really interesting.  It's crazy, right?  The phones are just ridiculous. 
[01:58:30]  We're never going to get to everybody, but we'll try.  Hold on.  But the important thing, Joe Rogan's at Caroline's tonight.  Very funny guy.  We're getting pretty intense here, bud.  We're getting deep.  We're here to learn.  Oh, I'm going to talk about my penis.  But his comedy makes you think a little bit, that's for sure.  So it's Joe Rogan and Ari at Caroline's tonight at 1230.  We'll continue with them in just a bit.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's time for football picks on the Opie and Anthony show.  I guess I'm out.  And I didn't do very well.  No, you suck.  Football picks sponsored by Dish Network.  Time to get more TV from your TV. 
[01:59:00]  Sign up for Dish Network today.  I gave the picks back to my brother.  And you want me to read what he wrote?  Yeah.  Or just.  All right.  He starts off by saying, got to take some risks this week.  Got to take some.  I picture him behind a desk.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, here it is.  Got to take some risks this week.  So I'm taking the Lions over the Giants.  Eli looked like a freaking child last week with all of the delay of game calls. 
[01:59:30]  I'm banking on Kitna getting the job done at home and have him starting on my fantasy team this week.  Tough call, though.  Doesn't he know Giants can just step on Lions?  Shut up.  All right.  That didn't work very well.  Joe would appreciate that crap, though.  Yeah, but it didn't work.  And has a great way of picking games.  He just looks at the names and goes into kind of a trippy place.  I decide what, well, kind of worked a little the first week.  Last week, horrible.  Yeah.  I figured a Giant could step on a Lion.  Yeah.  I can't figure fights out, and I do the commentary for the UFC. 
[02:00:00]  I'm wrong at least 50% of them.  Really?  Yeah.  It's just a coin toss for you?  Some of them are real obvious.  You know, I mean, some of them, you know, like, there's a line, and the line's there for a reason.  But especially mixed martial arts, you never know what the hell's going to happen.  Two dudes are swinging bones at each other.  Yeah.  It's just one connects, the other guy's down.  There's guys who have certain qualities, you know, and those qualities, like, you know,  it's not just, you know, styles make fights.  It's like some guys are just really good at keeping you from taking them down, and they'll  smash your face in.  But if those guys go up against a guy who's a really good kickboxer, then they're in 
[02:00:30]  trouble.  And if that guy goes up against a really good jiu-jitsu guy, he's in trouble.  And it's like, who's going to impose whose game on who first?  Yeah.  Who knows, man?  Anything can happen.  That's why picking this stuff is just silly.  Impossible.  It's just silly in the end, but.  Yeah.  Fun to gamble on it, though.  Makes fights so much more fun.  You got money riding on it.  Yeah.  I bet.  They shouldn't even keep score.  Just have fun.  Let me just.  Safety first.  Let me get this out of the way.  Safety first.  We got the charges over the Jaguars, according to my brother.  You want me to read what he wrote or just keep moving on?  You can move on, then. 
[02:01:00]  We got no time for his crap.  He's saying it's going to be a great day for Ohio in general.  He's taking the Browns over the Ravens and the Bengals over the Cardinals.  He's like saying it's good smelling poop.  Yeah.  A great day for Ohio.  Ohio's horrifying.  And then he's got the Saints over the Texans, the Rams over the 49ers, the Vikings over the Raiders.  That's my brother's football picks.  All sponsored by Dish Network.  Time to get more TV from your TV.  Sign up for Dish Network today. 
[02:01:30]  We don't have time to play the Jimmy Dean thing.  Maybe later because it's hilarious.  We got a few more phone calls for Joe Rogan, who's going to be at Caroline's tonight at 1230.  Pat, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I'm going to call.  Pat.  Hey, Pat.  Huh?  What's going on?  Listen, I have one first question for Joe Rogan is I saw him on The Weakest Link.  He definitely looked like he was thrown.  I don't think so.  I was bored.  I was probably falling asleep.  I thought that show was terrible.  It was the dumbest idea.  The lady was mean and everything.  Like, that's your thing? 
[02:02:00]  You're mean?  A little catchphrase.  She was, like, insulting my shirt.  I'm like, oh, this is great.  There was no rhyme or reason to how they kick people off.  If you salt her back, they cut it out.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they cut it out.  Yeah, I went after her.  Yeah, they cut it out.  Really?  Yeah, I just said, I think this whole thing of you being mean and, like, I think it's stupid  and played out.  That would be a great half-hour show.  Just a show of people insulting her back.  This is ridiculous.  You're mean for no reason.  I didn't understand it before I went on.  I wasn't sure if that's what she did all.  I thought it was just when, you know, like, you got eliminated.  You are The Weakest Link.  I thought it was, like, she was strict, but she, like, insults you. 
[02:02:30]  And I was like, oh, you're, like, a comic?  You're going to cut on me?  Like, what are you doing, stupid?  I go, this is played.  What are you, a dom?  I go, you know what?  I would rather we just move on with the show because I think this whole you being mean  is stupid and boring.  Where did that come from?  Where the hosts have to be rude?  She had this look at her face like, what?  Yeah, it must have been like, wait a minute.  This is my job.  You should have kicked her.  They couldn't have cut that out.  One minute she's fine.  The next minute she's just headless.  It just seems so stupid.  And then they did another one with a comic, right? 
[02:03:00]  Didn't they have some guy who was doing it for a while?  Yeah, the everyday show.  He was okay.  Oh, Ray Combs.  He was okay about it.  Ray Combs.  Ouch.  Hey, Pat.  It's only funny because the guy iced himself.  Isn't that sick?  It's the best thing about gallows humor.  That's a very silly hug-himself joke.  Literally gallows humor, yeah.  Hey, son, it's a comic in New York.  Survey said boo-hoo.  Pat, you got a question for Joe?  That's one too many on that?  Hey, Joe, what do you feel about deja vu?  That's a good question, man.  You know, I don't know what it is.  You know?  Who knows?  You know?  It's for your time, man.  Yeah.  I mean, it might be, you know, just a little, you know how you'll get like a little flash 
[02:03:30]  at home where the lights go a little brighter and then dim like a power surge?  It might be something like that.  I mean, our human body is really some sort of a complicated electrical system.  Deja vu could just be a quick like blip.  I heard that one theory on it is your brain absorbing the information that's coming in  at the moment reroutes that information through the section of your brain that deals with memory.  Wow.  So that as it's coming in, it's already becoming a memory so you kind of feel like you've already 
[02:04:00]  done it before.  That makes sense.  So you get this deja vu feeling.  Do you ever get like a, whenever I get a feeling like that though, I always make sure  that I'm extra cautious about what I'm doing.  I get like, what, what am I remembering here?  Why am I remembering?  Yeah.  I go, okay, let me just make sure I don't do anything stupid.  But then it goes away.  Yeah.  And then you're like, wait, no, I never did that.  That didn't even seem remotely familiar.  It might have just been like a warning light going off. 
[02:04:30]  Be careful.  Okay.  We're all right.  We're all right.  It's always stupid stuff.  I never get deja vu while I'm having sex or something hot.  Yeah.  No kidding.  It's always when a clerk is going, the item is not priced correctly.  Yeah.  You're like, wait, that happened before.  Exactly.  I mean, you say, did this happen already?  And they go, shut up.  No.  No, of course not.  Have you ever done it on stage?  Have you ever had it on stage, deja vu?  Yes.  And I felt like I was bombing.  Accurate.  But Jimmy will not be bombing at the Bregada come January.  Very good. 
[02:05:00]  By the way.  Of course not.  Very nice.  18th and 19th, tickets on sale now of January.  And Saturday has 40 tickets left.  So the Friday show is the one to go to.  And tonight and tomorrow, Providence, Rhode Island, Comedy Connection.  Powerful Jimmy Norton.  And I think Jimmy and I might be doing some stuff together in the future.  I want to do some gigs with Rogan.  That'd be cool.  As long as I go on first.  I don't want to follow Jim.  You don't want to follow Jim?  No.  I say that with love, too, and respect.  All right.  Let's go to Sarah.  I love you, too.  I love you, too.  Sarah?  Hey.  How are you?  Hey.  Hi, Sarah.  What's up, Sarah?  From Florida Street. 
[02:05:30]  What's going on, guys?  What's cracking?  Well, I was just commenting on, Opie, you were talking about you dream about your dad.  My dad died when I was 13.  And I still dream about him.  And it's the weirdest thing because it'll be a dream where it was like a government cover-up or something.  And he didn't really die.  He just, like, you know, he went on a weird vacation or something, you know.  And so it's the, I don't, I don't know how to, how to take it, but. 
[02:06:00]  I've had those before, too.  Well, they'll be.  Whenever a relative dies.  Yeah.  You just, we don't want it to be real, you know.  You want it to be back.  Maybe he'll come home soon.  I've had the ones where I go out to California.  How creepy would that be if he knocked?  You know what's the creepiest thing?  As a comic, as soon as she starts, the first thing you want to do is make some sort of a molestation joke.  Of course.  She's talking about she's 13 when her dad died.  And that's horrible.  And your brain goes, don't do it.  Just stop.  That's the first place I want to go if someone says two Jews walk into a bar. 
[02:06:30]  Please let this end well.  Let's go to Arizona.  It's Jim on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Jim, what do you got?  Yeah, I was going to ask Rogan if he ever heard of a drug called Shantix.  What is it called?  Shantix?  No.  They helped me to quit smoking.  Oh, is it like a pharmaceutical drug?  Yeah.  No, I've never heard of it.  It's called like Citifel, pre-based, something like that.  But after a week of taking this stuff, my dreams just got so intense and so outrageous that it blew me away. 
[02:07:00]  I mean, I dreamt my brother was murdering people and they're asking me to help him bury them underneath his house.  Wow.  Take it easy.  Whoa.  Pete Bundy.  Yeah, well, yeah.  Who knows what those things do?  Pete Bundy.  And what's the original purpose of this stuff for again, sir?  It cuts off the craving for nicotine.  You just tell your doctor you need to quit smoking.  Oh, wow.  You need to have a lot of supply of this stuff.  And it makes you hallucinate?  It just makes you dream.  How? 
[02:07:30]  It's pretty wild.  How crazy is it that cigarettes are illegal?  How can the government ever pretend they're taking care of people when 400,000 people die a year because of cigarettes?  It gives you nobody, any benefit whatsoever, and you never hear a peep out of any of these criminals.  They never talk about, let's end this.  Let's stop this.  Let's keep our kids from dying horrible deaths where it's literally like you're drowning to death.  That's how you die when you have lung cancer.  Like you have fluid in your lungs.  This guy whose wife is a nurse was describing it to us on Saturday. 
[02:08:00]  Ari, how creepy was that when he was describing it?  Super serious.  It's so scary.  He was telling a friend of ours who smokes, and he's like, it's the most horrifying death because they have to strap you down because you feel like you're drowning.  Yeah, you keep wanting to rise above.  You're trying to get above a level of water, but you can't.  Oh, man.  Good luck, bro.  Can you imagine?  And that's how they all end.  Nobody ends in their sleep.  Joe, go home.  Peaceful.  Just go home.  And you can't even ice yourself.  You can't even get a lethal dose of morphine to kill it off. 
[02:08:30]  Why does melatonin give me nightmares?  I take that once in a while.  I can't take it often because it makes me too sluggish the next day, but it always gives me bad dreams.  It's related to DMT as well.  It's all thought to be a part of the whole chemical soup, 5-methoxy, DMT, NN-DMT, melatonin.  There's a bunch of different things that your brain produces when you're sleeping.  That is a natural thing, though, melatonin.  Yeah, totally.  Because melanin gives me nightmares.  Wow.  Tryptophan is in there, too.  Michael from Long Island.  Before I finish my question, I saw Anthony's lips move. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  You're enough.  As soon as I went now, he's a ding-ding.  He's checking in.  The light bulb went off instantly.  Michael, what do you got?  We're running out of time over here.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  Hey.  I was watching a show recently that said that the humans today are descended from aliens  that came millions of years ago.  What's your opinion on that?  You know, there's not a whole lot of evidence of that.  The whole idea is based on Zachariah Sitchin's work where he deciphered the Sumerian text. 
[02:09:30]  And the Sumerian text, Sumer is the oldest known civilization ever.  It's where Iraq is today, which is one of the reasons why Iraqis are such douchebags.  They're like the townies of the world.  It's like that's where civilization was created.  That's where mathematics, government, astrology, astronomy.  It's a very fascinating, complex civilization where they had a detailed map of the solar  system with all the planets in the correct orbit, including Pluto.  We didn't know about Pluto until 1930.  You know, now it's not a planet anymore, but whatever.  Back then, they had everything they learned.  They could prove there was documentation that goes back that far for all that stuff? 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  There's stone carvings of the whole solar system.  I mean, there's not just that.  There's genetic engineering.  It's the originating symbol of the caduceus.  Those two serpents intertwined that means pharmacy.  That originated back then.  It's thought to have something to do with the double helix of DNA that they understood a lot of very complicated things,  like really incredibly complicated things.  And not only that, they had a detailed depiction of the creation of Earth, including the collision  that they know now happened. 
[02:10:30]  This is like, the scientists believe there's Earth 1 and Earth 2.  And Earth 1 existed before the collision.  It was a bigger, different planet.  And we were hit by another planet, an intruder planet.  And that's also what created, like, there's a thing called Bode's Law.  And Bode's Law is, if you know the size and the gravity of a planet, you can dictate how far away the next planet's going to be.  Works on every planet in the solar system except for Mars and Jupiter.  And because of Mars and Jupiter, in between there should be a planet.  But there's the asteroid belt.  And the asteroid belt is this gigantic belt that used to be a part of a planet. 
[02:11:00]  That's one of the theories.  And they knew about this.  They wrote about this 6,000 years ago.  And they say that everything they learned, they learned from the Anunnaki.  And what the Anunnaki literally translates into is those from heaven to Earth came,  as those who came down from this other planet.  And the idea is that they're on a planet called Nibiru.  And Nibiru is on an elliptical orbit that comes inside Earth and Jupiter,  between Jupiter and Mars in that area.  It comes around in that area every 3,600 years, supposedly. 
[02:11:30]  I mean, that sounds ridiculous because it seems like if that was really 3,000 years ago,  if there's a planet that comes through, wouldn't there be some writing about that somewhere?  Yeah, we would have seen it.  Those guys were dopes.  But the fascinating thing is how much they knew.  I find out that this civilization 6,000 years ago popped up out of nowhere.  And that's where mathematics came from.  They invented the wheel, first government, first astrology.  They named all the constellations, Leo and Cancer.  And they had all that back then.  They had all the depictions of the lion and the scales. 
[02:12:00]  All that stuff is from way back then.  I mean, it's really, really amazing that this civilization just sprung out of nowhere.  And this one scholar, Zacharias Hitchin, believes that this is where it gets really crazy.  The reason why human beings were created is to mine gold for these aliens  and that they need gold to suspend gold particles in their atmosphere to protect it  because their atmosphere eroded just like ours did.  Well, it sounds ridiculous, but in 2000, they had this symposium of all these different scientists got together  and they were coming up with ideas to if we lost the ozone layer, what we could do to shield ourselves. 
[02:12:30]  And the number one idea was suspending reflective particles in the atmosphere.  Really?  Yeah, like gold.  And gold is one of the most unusual metals.  It's very rare in that you can take a little tiny piece of gold and you can cover a huge surface with it.  That's why they use gold for plating, you know, gold plating on stuff.  And it's the same with gold powder.  And the gold powder would disperse.  If you could get gold powder, you could get so much more of it.  You could spread out so much further than any other kind of metallic particle.  Imagine if they did it wrong when they were trying to fix the atmosphere, 
[02:13:00]  just dropping blocks of gold.  Or it all just condensed gravity made in a big torpedo of gold crushing down in Manhattan.  Giant gold hole in all the streets.  It sounds crazy, but then if you look back and you go, well, why is everybody fascinated with gold?  I mean, what gold has been our number one currency in this world for thousands and thousands of years back  when, you know, you could give somebody a soft metal that you can't even make a knife out of it  and they'll give you a donkey.  Really?  Why would that guy give you a donkey for that metal piece of rock that's useless?  We saw the effect it had on women.  If you hand it to them, they go, well, what is that? 
[02:13:30]  It's currency.  I find it creepy that there's no one anywhere close to what we're doing as humans on this planet,  and that freaks me out.  Yeah.  Like, you don't see, like, we joke about it in very basic terms,  like, why isn't there an elephant at the bus stop waiting to get on the bus with us?  It's humans, and then who's in second place?  Yeah.  We even had a huge discussion about that,  and we couldn't come up with anybody close to us in second place.  No, there's no second place.  People went with dolphins.  Even dolphins.  People went with ants.  Yeah, but still. 
[02:14:00]  That's what creeps me out.  It's like, why are we so much more advanced than anything else living on this planet?  Well, what Sitchin says.  It doesn't make sense to me, so it makes me think something went awfully wrong with evolution  or possibly we came from somewhere else.  Well, we're the only animal that looks like dogs.  You know, if you look at dogs, you know, you can get a poodle and a Great Dane.  They can mate with each other.  You could have Shaquille O'Neal and Bridget the Midget, and they can mate with each other.  I mean, how crazy is that?  That's the same species?  How is that the same species?  It doesn't even make any sense.  I mean, if you get a tiger and a lion, they can't mate.  They make a liger. 
[02:14:30]  That thing's useless.  That thing is sterile.  But humans can make other humans out of anything.  We make functional human mixes out of anything.  I mean, if you look at it, humans created dogs through genetic engineering for selective breeding,  you know, and the idea is that that's how human beings were created,  that they took a lower hominid and they accelerated the evolution,  and that's what aliens did, and they're coming back, and they want their gold.  Ow!  All right.  We really have run out of time.  You just made the last hour very interesting, Joe.  Yeah, always a good time. 
[02:15:00]  And a lot of people want to know how they can join your cult.  Just go to JoeRogan.net.  JoeRogan.net.  Sign up for my mailing list.  Read Roganetics.  Roganetics.  And L. Ron Rogan.  United Caroline's Joe Rogan and Ari.  It's a great show.  Where you at there, Mr. Norton?  Oh, well, help me give you the number at 212-757-4100 to see Rogan tonight.  Get tickets early.  I usually go see you, Joe, but I don't know, because I got a hockey game to go to,  and then I got...  UFC Saturday.  Let me know.  And then I got Anthony's gig tonight.  Flannery's.  Flannery's.  It's going to be a Flannery's. 
[02:15:30]  It's at 14th and 7th.  What time?  Yeah.  About 11 o'clock.  Well, Brother Joe's doing the U2 thing, and then we're getting all the guys, and we're  gigging.  You going to get hammered?  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  Were you kidding?  You did not just ask Anthony that.  And tonight, tomorrow, that sounds like fun.  This is just a recipe for disaster.  I have the Ferrari 430 tonight.  No.  Oh, yeah.  No.  Yeah, it's going to be a hell of a weekend, boys. 
[02:16:00]  Radio host killed Stone going backwards on LIE.  He'll live on in our dreams, though.  Right, Joe?  And in the MP3s on the internet.  Yeah.  All right.  Did we get everything done?  Tonight, tomorrow, Rhode Island for me and the Comedy Connection, and then 18-19 of January,  Bogata.  Bogata.com.  All right.  We're going to go continue having fun at XM.  You guys have a great week.  Bye, folks.  Man.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now. 
[02:16:30]  Are we live?  Yes, we are.  I'm still getting situated here with the earbuds.  Situated.  Are we on?  I see stalker Patty is here for the big Friday walkover in the cold.  Hi.  It's not that bad today, though.  No, you know something?  I really thought it was going to be worse than it is.  Yeah.  And it's not.  But you go down one block, and that wind could whip up to, like, 80 miles an hour.  You know, I live on a really windy block, too. 
[02:17:00]  I don't want to worry anybody.  Who cares?  Oh, no.  The wind is to die for.  We feel like we're in the windy city, don't we, Jimmy?  We certainly do.  Sometimes I'll say, oh, how windy is it?  And he'll go, I know.  I know.  I feel like I'm in Chicago.  By the way, now that he can't hear us, what a creep Joe Rogan is.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Rogan just laying there in his isolation tank with his probably larger-than-average cock.  Right.  Fucking pounding the tank.  Bobbing up and down like a buoy.  Just jerking off and thinking about aliens.  Not at all.  His dick probably opens the lid. 
[02:17:30]  What a lunatic he is.  Thank God he can't hear us.  His fucking massive karate cock opening the lid.  Right.  Like a subsurfacing.  Yes, a periscope.  The only reason I looked interested was because he could kick my teeth in.  You know something, though?  That is some of that good, deep, dread-taking conversation.  Joe, that was an amazing two hours of radio, I've got to tell you.  I've got to hand it to you.  I can't hang with him.  That was fun.  Because he makes me want to get high again.  Yeah, see?  He makes it sound fun.  It's not that way. 
[02:18:00]  I'm not trying to get high until I get escaped.  That's what the problem is with getting high.  People do it to try to escape.  I'm trying to dig in deeper.  Tell these kids how cool it is to get high, Joe.  Listen, kids.  Don't listen to everything.  There's a loud...  Joe Rogan!  Joe Rogan!  Joe Rogan!  Exactly!  Thank you.  Joe Rogan!  Thank you very much.  Joe Rogan, for fear of...  What?  Hello.  Hi, ma'am.  I used to be on TV.  Hi.  You know Joe Rogan.  Do you remember...  Ma'am, ma'am.  Teacher lady.  Do you remember this guy from TV? 
[02:18:30]  What happened?  You remember this guy from TV?  They're on the radio right there.  Yes.  Chris Hansen gave him cookies.  Get away.  Get away from them.  They're awful people.  Look at she's dragging her kids away from us.  She dragged the children away.  He strutted off away.  He went cookies with a little strut.  Yeah, she wasn't...  She was none too happy with that.  Ah, fuck her.  A little joke.  A little joke.  Ugh.  Are we there yet? 
[02:19:00]  I know.  It's a walkover.  It stinks.  Look at this older gentleman.  You gotta look for your toolbar.  That's what it is.  Yeah, you gotta...  Did you plug it in the monitor?  Wow, he really does.  Wow.  Ladies, where are you off to today?  Where are you off to?  Broadway show, unfortunately.  Oh, no.  The strike and all, yes.  Oh, the Broadway strike.  Gotcha, huh?  You guys are fooling us here.  No, we're not. 
[02:19:30]  No, no.  We wouldn't fool you.  Why would we fool you?  What did you want to see that was the strike handle?  Jersey Boys.  Oh, yes.  Jersey Boys.  Jersey Boys, Mama Mia, and...  Wicked.  Wicked.  That's it.  Yeah, I know.  Where are you guys from?  Uh, Hilton Head.  Oh, North Carolina or South?  South.  Okay.  So what are you doing instead of going to the play?  We haven't decided yet.  We're going to Soho and look at galleries today.  Just people singing for no fucking reason.  It doesn't make any sound entertaining.  A lot of gangs down there. 
[02:20:00]  We could suggest a few peep shows if you want.  Over and over again.  They do it day in, day out.  That's what's fascinating when your vagina shuts down.  Musicals and stuff like that become fascinating.  I wanted to ask her, why does your head taper like that?  But I felt it would be inappropriate.  There's no nice way to say that.  Miss, your head is tapering.  And she's just walking around in a fucking moo-moo.  What is that thing?  What is that fucking Mrs. Roper dress she's got on?  How amazing are you guys living in New York about the musical thing?  How boring and fucking... 
[02:20:30]  What a murderous assault in your attention span most of those things are.  Isn't that amazing?  Musicals suck.  The whole singing every word thing is ridiculous.  I can understand you throw a song in there every so often.  But singing every word thing just blows.  I always hated the fucking West Side Story because of that shit.  Let's get stalker Patty high today.  Hey, Patty.  No, she would have a heart attack.  Come here.  No, I'm on medication.  Do you want to get high today?  No, thank you.  I don't get high.  Have you ever been high? 
[02:21:00]  I just drink coffee.  That's it.  She gets high on cock.  She gets high on cock.  You have a very sexy stance.  Yeah.  I'm cold.  Wow.  You've got the stance of a pear.  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  That secretary spread thing is really taking its toll, Patty.  Jimmy made her cum once.  Yeah.  Good for you.  Good for you.  Two days when he had to prove himself to us.  Not anymore, obviously.  Then I pictured her in a coffin and I made myself cum. 
[02:21:30]  Patty, have you ever done drugs?  No.  I have health issues.  But you were a child of the 60s.  Didn't you have some drugs?  I was only 9, 10, 11 years old in the 60s.  See?  Child of the 60s.  That's what I said.  Yeah, I was too young.  All right, chiclet teeth.  What was the craziest drug you did?  Smoke a little pot.  I took vitamins.  My friend gave them to me and I thought that was crazy enough and I was 16. 
[02:22:00]  Vitamins.  How awful.  How awful is right.  You're crazy.  All right, we'll see you guys upstairs in a few minutes.  Delivered rectally, maybe.  Heading in tech, Sam.  She's terrible.  She should take vitamin C because she's a cunt.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  See you upstairs.  Nice. 
[02:22:30]  Joe Rogan checking out the XM studio for the first time.  I think he's loving it.  Fucking badass.  Everyone digs it.  Now it's awesome.  Now it's truly a hangout.  This is so sweet.  The couch set up.  You got a stripper pole.  Huge desk here.  I mean, you can fit like 10 comics here.  This is awesome.  We have a whole band here.  We haven't figured out how to use the other side of the studio.  We've done it once or twice and we realize we get way too comfortable.  We start to fall asleep. 
[02:23:00]  But sit in one of those chairs really fast.  I'm not even kidding.  By we, I mean me.  The one that's already reclined over there, Joe, to your right.  Oh, cool.  Just sit in there for two seconds.  You want to talk about floating.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's nice.  How great is that?  Sensory deprivation show.  How do you do a radio show sitting in that thing?  This is very comfortable.  Yeah.  All right.  Get back over here.  Big screens everywhere, man.  But they fucked up the couch thing, by the way.  That couch is the worst couch I ever sat on.  What?  Sat in.  Oh, what happened to the other one? 
[02:23:30]  Yes.  Jimmy, go sit in that real fast.  The recliners are probably the softest recliners I've ever sat in.  The couch sucks.  Wow.  This is really great if you're having your fucking teeth pulled and you're in a waiting room.  I feel like I'm waiting for a bus at a bus stop.  It's fucking, this is a terrible, the other sofas were so comfy.  And this is like an L-shaped wraparound.  It really is bad.  You guys have never seen a fucking tinier sofa corner.  Who can relax on this?  This fucking stinks.  Yeah, it's too bad.  It does kind of suck.  Because the recliners are really good, but the couch is so stiff. 
[02:24:00]  It's fucking bleachers.  Bleachers, huh?  An L-shaped couch should have like a lot of depth to it.  Yes.  I've never seen a more shallow, I'm a small guy, and right now I'm sitting and half of  my asshole is not on the sofa.  My asshole is split.  A barely upholstered two by four.  This is fucking awful.  How much of a relief is it to come over here and just go buck wild after you do the regular  show?  I know.  Oh, I prefer the CBS show.  It's so fun to dance around the woods.  Why say cunt when you can say see?  By the way, to put something to rest, we truly did not do XM yesterday because there 
[02:24:30]  was an equipment problem with the master computer and dilette and all that shit.  I know yesterday's show was a little weird at first, but in the end, we did not do the  show over here because there was a major issue with the equipment.  Also, I was thinking about taking the day off to begin with because of that story I told  about Jay, our old friend Jay.  He was coming into town, haven't seen him in six months, and I wanted to leave early 
[02:25:00]  to begin with because I wanted to hang out with him for like four hours while he had  a layover.  What, some insiders knew some information?  They just babbled to a point.  You got to say something to stop everybody.  That's exactly what happened.  Exactly.  Everyone knows everything.  And we didn't rerun the first part of the show because it was just so weird and just  it just was who gives a crap stuff.  We decided to like throw something else in there.  Don't worry about it.  And we're going to be doing more of that as we move forward.  If there's segments that are just god awful, we are going to take them out and put something 
[02:25:30]  that's a little more entertaining.  Until there's no show left to play.  That's right.  We'll just be playing the fucking commercial breaks.  Something else I should have thought before I tried talking.  If you want to hear the Opie and Anthony show in its purest form, then make sure you  tape it every day and then you're guaranteed to hear, you know, the show in its entirety.  But for replays and such, we might, you know, fuck around a little bit.  So just deal with it.  We're allowed.  Are people getting upset?  They get a little antsy. 
[02:26:00]  They're, uh...  Our listeners are intense at times.  But it's cool that you guys actually have interaction with them.  I mean, even if they're wrong and retarded.  Oh, I know.  It's cool that you're taking them into account and you're listening to what they're saying  and you're going, no, that's not what's going on.  Yeah, there's a complete interaction.  But now they'll argue about what I said and go, oh, I can hear it in his tone that he's  just, like, covering his ass and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  It's like, oh, my God, whatever you're saying.  But I'm done with it.  That's exactly what happened.  I'm telling you. 
[02:26:30]  And simple as that.  If you want to continue, you know, trying to figure shit out, then have fun.  That's when you find out how dumb most conspiracy theories really are when they come against  you.  You're like, what?  I said, what was I doing?  Yeah, wait.  What?  Shut up.  You shifted your weight to your left foot.  Come on.  I saw the look.  Hey, a bunch of things we want to do.  Joe noticed the bleachers, too.  Here's what we can do with the bleachers.  We've only done it one time.  And we have a pretty good crowd because we did the walkover today.  You guys can walk with us every day, even if we're not broadcasting it, by the way. 
[02:27:00]  And you can come in and sit on the bleachers.  We did it once.  You bring the bleachers in and they're right behind you.  Oh, nice.  That's pretty sick.  It's tight in this room, too.  That's nice.  Well, we take out the couches and stuff.  But they roll out, we roll the bleachers in, and they sit right there so you have a complete  live audience.  That's pretty badass.  Maybe we'll do it around, you know, we'll just get settled and maybe we'll switch it  up a little bit today just to show you what this place could really do.  This is awesome.  We got to do Jimmy Dean's Sausage Guy for Joe. 
[02:27:30]  Also, Joe in Pennsylvania has something.  Joe, what's up?  Oh, this is John.  Whatever.  Hi, John.  John, what's up?  Hey, I was wondering if Joe Rogan ever dressed sexy to get some extra drugs.  Dress sexy?  No, sir.  I like Rich Voss.  I make a reasonable income.  I just pay for it.  You're going to leave it a longer than I was, Joe.  What's that, brother?  That was a Voss story.  Rich Voss dressed sexy.  We're tight short shorts because the drug deal.  All right, guys, sir.  You go ahead and ask another question while I'm explaining to the guests what you just  said.  Sorry.  I don't need to have an interaction, sir.  It's all about you. 
[02:28:00]  I'm just a fucking actor in your play.  Go right ahead.  Hey, Anthony.  Yes, sir.  I was kidding, sir.  Sir, I was being sarcastic.  Well, that was your cue to hold off.  Well, shoot me right now, Joe.  Just shut up.  Okay.  Hey, Anthony.  So, Joe, what that is.  He's still doing it.  Yeah, I know.  He's this fucking guy.  So, don't hang up on him.  I kind of like his gumption.  Go ahead, sir.  No, I'm not going to hang up, buddy.  No, no, no.  Go ahead.  That's all right.  Go ahead.  You see how this hurts? 
[02:28:30]  Now I'm going to do it to you.  Makes you feel small and insignificant, doesn't it?  Can I speak now?  Holla.  Go ahead.  I sent an email to Steve C for Anthony.  I was wondering if he got it.  He did, actually, and he fucking deleted it because it was offensive.  No, it's like...  He kept trying to answer, and you kept emailing in the middle.  I love that.  I gave an email to Steve C for Anthony, and I'm like, what?  Steve C doesn't even come in with the fucking things that we need for the show.  Why would he have emails sent?  How many emails do I get?  We shut down our email accounts.  You don't have people emailing you anymore? 
[02:29:00]  A long time ago.  A long time ago.  I try to keep up.  I'll tell you why.  I just don't want anybody to feel like I'm obligated to keep up, but I try.  Because I couldn't answer everybody back.  You can't.  It's impossible.  People get mad.  And my OCD kicked in, and I'm like, oh, God, I've got to answer all 300 emails today.  And then the next day, it was another 300, and then it was never-ending.  I have my personal email.  That's it.  Here's the rule of thumb I use.  I delete all the spam, and I answer anything with a cunt.  Wow.  And then I had a clever- 
[02:29:30]  That's good.  Let me just sit for a moment.  Yeah, let that just sit there.  That was one of those ones you swing, and then lay rich.  You just kind of throw the bat to yourself and think it over.  After you miss.  Oh, wow.  We got Kevin Smith checking in today?  Oh, good.  Sorry about the C word, Kev.  Did we know he was calling?  Yes.  It's on the list.  I was trying to make it sound natural.  Thanks for going for it.  He's just improv-ing and calling the show.  Kev wants to just talk about something we heard.  I like to think the show's just, oh, wow, Kevin, out of nowhere he's calling.  That's cool.  Let's chat with him. 
[02:30:00]  I didn't know Rogan was stopping by.  You know, we like that feel.  We're waiting for him to be put on hold.  I wish I lived here.  Well, I hate the cold, but I wish I lived here so I could come on all the time.  Yeah, this would be a great hang for you.  I would love it.  We're going to do something with stalker padding a little bit, too, I think.  I think it's time that she needs more money.  We got something good for her today.  I guess we could plug this in the meantime.  Why is he talking when he can talk to us?  He's not.  They're on hold.  Rather talk to Travis. 
[02:30:30]  Saturday Night Virus, special edition, starting at 7, 10 p.m.  Smodcast with Kevin Smith.  Also, this Saturday, 9 p.m., Big Kev's Geek Stuff.  Go to bigkevsgeekstuff.com.  But all that, just put it aside, because at 11 p.m., Master Poe takes control of the microphones for the arena.  Master Poe will be talking about the martial arts and fighting and, well, whatever else Master Poe wants to talk about. 
[02:31:00]  And it's the arena?  That's what it's called?  Yes.  We got a new description for Master Poe today.  Who came up with it?  The video game?  Oh, he's the video game boss.  Oh, when you get to that level?  Yeah, you reach that level.  There he is right there.  He's like, oh, did you defeat Poe?  Did you get past the Poe?  Yeah.  He looks like he should be in the Matrix, of course.  That or Reservoir Dogs.  Right.  He's wearing his Reservoir Dogs suit today. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, he is.  I want to be Mr. Black.  No, Mr. Yuck.  Master Poe, tell us about your show.  What's the show about?  Good morning, guys.  What I'd like to discuss is mixed martial arts, street fighting, traditional combat, put it all together, what works, what doesn't work, and what arena.  Because you have mixed martial arts.  I love it.  It's great.  These guys are in incredible shape.  They can kick a bag harder than I've ever seen in my entire life.  They can punch somebody and knock them out with no problem. 
[02:32:00]  I want to see, or I want to talk about mixed martial arts in the street.  Would you get on the ground on the street if somebody has a knife?  Or would you, you know, do ground for pound while you're on the floor or while you're in the street?  So it's a combination of what works and in what arena.  That does, that's really true.  But it's really better to just get really good at the stuff that works the best on people who know how to fight.  Because the stuff that works the best on people who know how to fight, that's the real stuff. 
[02:32:30]  That works everywhere.  That works in the street.  In the street.  That works in the gym.  That works in a fight.  It works.  You know what sucks?  That's what people are doing in mixed martial arts.  I hate that.  There's a lot of people that have crazy ideas about taking people out of the knees and I'll just poke them in the eyes.  And I have a friend of mine who weighs 135 pounds.  He's the nicest guy in the world.  But he's convinced that he's going to kick someone's knee out and punch someone in the eye.  And to the point where I'm worried about him.  I'm like, you know, you idiot.  You can't defend yourself.  You're fucking fragile.  You're a little tiny thing.  And so I've often thought about doing it, but I don't want to do it to him.  Like, tell him to come out with me in the yard and go try to hit me. 
[02:33:00]  I just want you to just come out to me.  And you'll show him and humble him.  I'm not going to hurt you.  I promise you I won't hit you.  I'm just going to strangle you real easy.  And it's going to be shocking.  It's going to make you feel real weird.  Joe, I don't know how to fight.  That sucks for me.  You sound like fucking...  I just don't know.  You sound like Jeff McCullough in Dog Day Afternoon.  It's true.  I don't know how.  The way I learned how is by doing it, man.  Yeah, but I never got into many fights.  You don't have to get into fights.  I don't get into fights. 
[02:33:30]  No, no.  Here's the other thing.  I would probably take a class.  Here's my personality.  I'd probably take a class.  I'd learn whatever I need to learn.  But then in a real-life application, I'd probably just freeze up and fucking freak out and just  pull out a gun and shoot it in the head for the dumbest fucking thing.  I can give you the perfect analogy.  I need something in between running and killing somebody.  The best analogy for you is because you love games.  You're a video gamer.  It's just like a real-life video game.  It's just you have to force your body to actually learn the moves. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  That's what it's like.  And then like, but you got the adrenaline pumping when it's real life.  You know, this is like, I'm going to either get my ass kicked or I got to kick this guy's ass.  But you get used to conflict.  And training all the time and constantly doing jiu-jitsu, you get so used to like really aggressive conflict.  It's just normal.  Yeah.  It becomes a normal part of life.  And if you were really good at martial arts, you would fucking love it.  You would love.  You don't know what it's like to strangle a man.  I would love to strangle people, Joe. 
[02:34:30]  You would feel so much more relaxed just knowing that you could do that.  Just knowing I could.  It relaxes you.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah.  Why do you think you like guns so much, man?  Because it relaxes me to know someone comes in my house, their head is gone.  Exactly.  But I need something between running away crying and shooting someone in the head.  It's like, those are my two options.  That's my fight or flight option.  That's where jiu-jitsu comes in.  Go with Indian burn.  Indian sunburn on the wrist.  How's this feeling, pally?  Or I say pink belly. 
[02:35:00]  Pink belly?  Yeah, go pink belly on them.  Or just hang out with big friends.  I really have to learn how to fight, I think.  It clears up a huge part of men's problems in life.  Yeah.  Because once you know how to fight, you don't feel like you're scared of it all the time.  Yeah.  So you don't invite it as much.  And you're friendlier to people.  I always got punched in the head growing up.  I rarely got into fights.  But when I did, I would try, but probably they smelled fear on me and just wailed me in the head. 
[02:35:30]  I would always get punched in the head.  Would you fight back after that or would you just go down?  No, I would fucking go down.  I'm bleeding from the eyeball.  I remember this one kid out in California.  We're in front of the fucking Vons.  And I knew him from school.  And we weren't friends, but we were by no means enemies.  And he goes, hey, Cuma, let's slap fight.  And I was like, all right.  So, you know, put up a little whatever guard I know.  And I go reach in to fucking slap him in the face. 
[02:36:00]  He fucking right hand fists me right in my eye and put me on the sidewalk.  And I'm there with my head going bing and blood pouring down my face and just looking at him going laughing at me.  Did you cry?  I was like fucking down for the count.  Yeah, he wound up like I went in to slap him.  And when my head went forward to slap him, he was waiting there with this right hand fucking right across my eye.  Whoa, what a douchebag. 
[02:36:30]  A total douchebag.  And wouldn't it be nice to shoot a double, take that guy down and fucking strangle him to death?  See, yes.  I would have loved to sink that choke in.  You don't know.  For years that bothered the shit out of me.  Years I fucking went, I want to kill that guy.  You're right.  I'm still talking about it and bothered by it.  I have a Gabriel Mares, his name was.  And I still want to fucking punch him in the head.  Just keep in mind, we got Kevin Smith on hold.  Oh, no, bro.  We're trying to get to him.  Let's talk to Kevin. 
[02:37:00]  I have one question for Joe.  One question because you're a guy who can really fight.  What's the most satisfying time somebody either, A, like screamed at you in a car and had to get out and realize that you were going to murder?  When's the most satisfying time that that came into play?  You know, I avoid almost all bullshit.  I don't get into arguments with people in cars.  I go, whatever.  You know, the only time I ever get in a situation with someone is when I feel like I have to defend myself.  Or a guy talking to your chick at a bar.  When's the most satisfying time that you were ever able to use that, even without fighting, to just brush somebody away?  People, you know, for the most part, you could avoid stuff. 
[02:37:30]  On stage at the Comedy Store in February?  Yeah, that was one.  Yeah, all right.  Wait, what happened?  On stage at the Comedy Store in February, a guy named Carlos Mancia.  You guys have a little beef?  No.  I heard something.  He's a swell little, hey, fat.  Let's go to Kevin Smith.  I can't even talk about it anymore.  I can't even come out of my mouth anymore.  Kevin.  Hi, Kevin.  Listen, man, you don't need martial arts or any of that bullshit. 
[02:38:00]  If you get into a confrontation with somebody and somebody tries to kick your ass, I've always found it best.  If you offer to suck their dick, one of the things is going to happen.  Either they're going to take you up on it and you're out of the situation, or they're going to think you're so fucking pathetic and you're out of the situation.  No, Kevin.  He forgot the third option, which is you suck their dick, they come in your mouth, and then they beat you for being a faggot. 
[02:38:30]  God damn.  That's awful.  Yeah, that's about as bad as it gets.  Hey, Kevin.  How are you guys?  Pretty good, man.  Very good, man.  You got the Smodcast coming up?  The Smodcast, of course, airs on, what is it, 202?  Yeah, 202.  Yep, 202.  You and Scott Mosier.  So that's happening, but we announced our Zack and Mary cast.  Oh!  Yeah, you couldn't announce it on our show a week or two ago. 
[02:39:00]  Now it's official.  Now it's official.  When are you going to give us a little scoop?  I just gave you a scoop about my fighting technique.  Yes.  That is true.  My bullfrog style.  Bullfrog style?  Has this been filmed yet?  Not yet, sir.  All right, good, because I know we had discussed some stuff.  So who else is in the cast?  Who else besides Jimmy Norton?  Yes.  Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks.  Oh, very nice.  Yeah, pretty huge for us. 
[02:39:30]  Very cool.  And the gist of the story?  Uh, these two cats are so broke and they got nothing, they got no prospects in life, they  decide the best way to get out of debt is to make a porn flick.  Nice.  I've never thought about it.  Beautiful.  Yeah.  What's it called, the movie?  Zach and Miri Make a Porno.  Oh, perfect.  Wow.  Awesome.  That's funny.  If you know the title, you don't have to ask what it's about.  No.  True.  Yeah.  You're wrong, because if you ask what it's about, you find out it's a meditation on the 
[02:40:00]  Holocaust.  Hey, Kevin, what was the last drug you did?  Last drug I did was, um, I got stoned, uh, last poker game I played in, in Jersey, um,  this dude, Frank, had a, had a bullet with him and we, we smoked some weed.  Yeah.  We, we've been talking about drugs a lot this morning.  That's my, I've never gone harder than, than weed. 
[02:40:30]  Uh, everything else scares me.  Remember when I'm biased?  Remember he did that Coke and his heart exploded?  Yeah.  Oh, lefty man.  Wow.  It was huge.  I mean, I was in high school at that point and any curiosity I had about it went out the  fucking window.  Have you guys heard about this new drug that they're rocking in Florida called Jenkum?  Mm-mm.  There's a drug called Jenkum and it originated.  That's that African stuff?  Yeah.  Yes.  Sewage?  They take a, a big old empty bottle of Coke or Pepsi, you know, big two liter bottle and  they pack, um, half pack it with shit and urine and then they put a balloon over the top 
[02:41:00]  of the, of the, of the bottle, the opening and then let it ferment for like two or three  hours in the sun.  A lot of work to make this drug.  And then, um, you take the balloon, you know, you hold the balloon closed, take it off  and fucking inhale it.  And this apparently makes you very high.  Why?  A lot of kids are doing it.  Pretty crazy.  Yeah.  I saw that in Africa.  The street name is Butt Hash.  Right.  Butt Hash.  How long does it keep you high for?  Uh, they say that it immediately knocks you out. 
[02:41:30]  And when you come to, you have this bizarre sense of euphoria for, from an hour to all day  long.  Does your breath smell like shit?  Of course it does.  Oh yeah.  Everything smells like shit.  The true fact is that the kids complain that their breath smells like, uh, sewage.  We talked about it on, on Smodcast this week.  Is it, uh, what is it?  Just inhaling methane or something?  Yeah.  Eventually it's getting the methane high, man.  But you know, you're kind of left with the, the taste of raw sewage in your mouth for,  for days at a time.  But can you imagine wanting to get high so badly that you're like, I'm going to take 
[02:42:00]  the time to whip up, whip up that concoct.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Quite frankly.  The article that I saw on it was horrible.  There was these little African kids just digging into raw sewage with their hands and pouring  it into little like water bottles, making this stuff.  And depending on what area of Africa it is, you could kind of like, I can't agree with  it or condone it, but you get your head around it like, that's a cheap high.  Oh yeah.  You're talking about kids in fucking Florida, dude.  That's pretty crazy.  You're not enough for a dime bag.  You're like, I'm willing to inhale shit and piss. 
[02:42:30]  The kid in Africa in the article that I read said that when he had the hallucinations,  it made him see his mother who had just recently died and he could, he could talk to her and  be with her.  Oh, so that's why he, uh, fuck.  He lives in Africa, he's smelling shit and his mother's dead and he's five and he's just  wandering in the fucking jungle with a, with a little water bottle full of shit.  Full of shit for him to get his butts off.  That's fucking crazy, man.  You know?  It's like a whole nother world over there.  Whoa, holy shit it is.  How about, how about...  One of its nicknames is, did you ever see that clip online, the video game, where the 
[02:43:00]  dude was like, Leroy Jenkins.  Yeah.  Oh, well no, fan says yes.  That's pretty obscure.  Yes, it's a classic actually.  It's a pretty fucking funny clip, but they call it Leroy Jenkins here in the States as well.  I would think the little kid should dig and plant a seed.  Does anybody know what game they're playing?  Is it World of Warcraft or something like that?  Hmm.  It's a game where you can get together online, a bunch of people could do it.  Yeah.  And in this online reality, they had a funeral for one of the characters died.  And then, you know, you're supposed to observe some sort of armistice while that's going 
[02:43:30]  on in this game.  Really?  Some dude came in with weapons and just slaughtered everybody.  At a funeral?  Oh, that is so fucking hilarious.  That's funny.  That's hilarious.  People get so furious about that shit.  Did he just write, pwned?  You've been, your funeral's been pwned.  Noob.  I had a real online problem for a long time.  I played Quake online, like eight hours a day.  I couldn't stop. 
[02:44:00]  I was so addicted.  You know what I've been playing?  This isn't going to sound nearly as manly, and this is why I have to suck the  disc to get out of fights.  On Facebook, they have a game.  I'm so embarrassed.  Oh, no.  I know what you're talking about.  On Facebook, they have a game called Scrabulous.  Oh, no.  It's an online Scrabble game.  That's as hard as I get.  Are you at least dominating?  That's my street cred.  I'm like, I'll talk to you in Scrabulous.  What kind of graphics card do you need to play that one?  Pretty much the same graphics card they used on the Atari 26th. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, right.  Are you a good Scrabble player, Kev?  I happen to like Scrabble.  I'm a Scrabble fan, sir.  I do enjoy it, but I'm very competitive.  Fucking Spellers.  I don't know.  I used to, in the beginning, go for the big words to impress, but that's how you lose  the game.  Have you ever played Jimmy Kimmel?  What the?  Have you ever played Jimmy Kimmel?  No.  He's really good at it.  Is he?  Is he really?  Yeah, he's obsessed with it.  Fucking people that are good at spelling.  Very good at Scrabble.  God, I hate it.  I'm so bad.  I'm not better than Jimmy Kimmel, I'm sure, but I play a little Scrabble.  I get all stressed out when the little hourglass is running out of sand. 
[02:45:00]  And you still have a word?  I don't have a word because I don't know how to spell.  So I'm like sitting there going, that is my fucking weakness, man.  I can't spell worth a shit.  I can't spell worth a shit either.  And no matter how many times Microsoft Word corrects me, I never fucking remember it.  I just see that little red line underneath and I go, oh yeah, I fucked it up again.  It's an I before an E, douchebag.  Yeah, I spell weird right twice in the last five years.  Oh, weird is one of those words that just fucks me up.  Important or important?  What the fuck is it, an A or an E? 
[02:45:30]  A!  An A!  Oh, right!  That's an easy one.  No, it isn't!  It is!  This is very important.  That's why I say important.  So it's not like important.  And they both look right written down.  No, they don't.  No.  Yes, it does.  That's why I fuck it up.  Leave it.  Tell me what I feel.  I was with you.  This fucks me.  I get fucked by Necessary and Access.  Yeah, shit like that.  Is it two C's or one?  Two S's?  What the fuck is that?  It's two and two.  A-X-E-S.  I got Access. 
[02:46:00]  Do ya?  What's trouble?  Thank God for things like...  Just even Yahoo.  I've been...  I write an email or something like that or I'm trying to write something and not look  like an idiot.  And I'll just pop it into Yahoo and just hit it and it'll usually tell you if it's right  or wrong.  I know you could go to thedictionary.com or whatever, but I just usually have Yahoo up.  So I pop it on there.  And sometimes I get it so wrong that it doesn't even know what the fuck I'm trying to say.  Doesn't even know what I'm trying to say.  Do you know what word always gets me?  I know it's I before E, I think, except after C or whatever, but I receive... 
[02:46:30]  But not always.  I know.  There's a little silly rules.  I receive it.  I can never get, but I'm a good speller.  I have to put that out there on the table.  You are.  Yeah, they call me the fucking, uh, the spelling kid.  I don't remember ever hearing...  You're called the spelling kid.  Yeah.  Don't you love guys that make their own fucking nicknames?  That's right.  I like the spelling kid.  Actually, my nickname for myself was Kid Spells It Right, but it was, uh, the I, instead  of I-S, it was I-Z, you know, just to kind of ghetto it up. 
[02:47:00]  I want to thank...  All I know is, for the many times people will be like, why do you do Opie and Anthony?  Those dudes are juvenile in grade school.  I've, I've never felt that until you guys started admitting you couldn't spell important.  Don't do it.  Let's stick it up for us.  Those motherfuckers may be right.  These dudes have the spelling skills of a six-year-old.  Let it be known.  I'm sorry.  It just...  It was the only one that didn't know.  That's right.  We're still smart.  It...  I had to have a weakness somewhere.  True.  You know?  You're failing from it.  I, I, I know, I know everything.  I want to thank Kevin Smith for making us talk about spelling for 15 minutes. 
[02:47:30]  Well, you know, the real problem is...  Huh?  Did you say Emmett Smith or Kevin?  Kevin.  Oh, my God.  I just heard Emmett Smith.  There's, there's all sorts of holes in our language that we haven't fixed.  We just keep spelling things the same way.  Yeah.  You know?  It's very, very twisted little language.  Can't we just spell everything phonetically?  Well, a lot of times it doesn't work.  Love that.  Silent letters and what the fuck?  Yeah.  2007, for real.  Yeah.  Silent letters, still.  Silent letters.  It makes zero sense.  For what?  Yeah, for who?  Subtol.  It's just to fake out.  That's the, you know, they keep silent letters to just fake out the foreigners. 
[02:48:00]  It's shitty code.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  That's how you flush out somebody who's not.  It's shitty coding.  That's what it is.  It's shitty coding.  It's shitty communication coding.  That's all it is.  Maybe Kevin.  It's just bad Microsoft Word.  It's gotta be debugged.  1994.  Maybe on the set, me and you play a little Scrabble.  What do you say in between those scenes?  I'm all for this, sir.  I'll bring my travel Scrabble.  Oh, shit.  Travel Scrabble sucks.  I like a big fucking, I don't fucking, I have the little magnetic ones, they all get  fucking, it drives me nuts.  Fucking magnet ones suck.  Not for nothing, but I got important people like Seth Rogen in the movie, dude. 
[02:48:30]  I don't want people to see me playing Scrabble.  I gave that guy Stoner of the Year award at the High Times Awards.  Really?  Yeah.  Stoner of the Year.  All right.  I was honored to give him Stoner of the Year.  Kevin, it's time to tell Jimmy what his part is gonna be in the movie.  Yeah, because I didn't know, he's gotta prepare now.  I don't want to ruin it here, but it's, I tell you, it's not a big part, but it's, it  is, he is apt for this role.  Okay, is it a sexy, do I walk in shirtless and say something dramatic to a woman and she  comes?  Will he be on screen more than he was in Spider-Man? 
[02:49:00]  Yes.  Okay.  Will words be coming out, or am I playing the part of like a guy in a mall who sits there?  Words will be coming out.  Memorable words.  Wow.  Powerful.  Memorable.  Nice.  Memorable.  Who's that Banks girl?  Who was she?  She was in Spider-Man as well.  She played Betty Brant, but she was in, uh, did you ever see Invincible, the Mark Wahlberg  movie about the football dude?  My friend Doug was in that.  It made me sick to my stomach, so I couldn't watch it.  The, uh, she was in that.  She was in, uh, 40-year-old virgin. 
[02:49:30]  She was the chick in the tub.  Oh, God, that girl was hot.  She was in Scrubs.  She was in Slither.  Did you ever see Slither?  No, I know who you're talking about now.  It was a good fucking movie, man.  Slither?  She was in that.  She was in Wet Hot American Summer.  She was a good movie.  What's Slither?  I never saw it.  Slither is the movie, uh, it's kind of like, um, it's a, it's a piss take on, but not  a complete comedy piss take on, like, a monster from space movie.  Like, Invasion of the Body Snatcher is the closest thing I can do.  Yeah, I remember seeing the trailer.  And it's a two thumbs up from Kevin Smith?  Yeah, it's totally worth watching. 
[02:50:00]  Fuck yeah.  Write that down.  You've got a sense of humor to it.  Fuck, I gotta start working on my skills.  Yeah.  He's all worried.  Now he's all worried.  He's a romantic lead in the new Kevin Smith movie.  He's gotta fucking bone up.  I'll work on my skills.  Bring yourself, sir.  That's, you're, you're fine.  Your skills are there.  You're cast for your skills.  Does the part, does the part require, like, opening your eyes really wide to show emotion?  Because if it does, I'm the fucking main man for this movie.  You'll just act surprised in every scene.  What? 
[02:50:30]  You do have the look of somebody who's recently had a facelift.  Yes.  I look like a burn victim with good skin.  You have the wide-eyed skills of a young buckwheat, sir.  A burn victim with good skin.  Like, somehow they fix you, but your skin is too small?  Yeah, my lips never came back, and my fucking eyes open way too wide.  It just gives everybody the willies.  I really am awful.  But I know how to be angry on film.  Like, when I'm angry, I just shake my fist a lot. 
[02:51:00]  I'm fucking good.  Let's do this picture.  What about crying?  You're dropping performance clinics, sir.  Well, I need...  Lee Strasberg.  Joe asked about crying.  It's fucking easy.  I look and I just...  I actually will enunciate boo-hoo.  That's crying.  You know what's weird with crying in movies?  A lot of actors, like, great criers.  Demi Moore, great crier.  Denzel Washington's a great crier.  A lot of them cannot actually tear in movies, so it doesn't look like they're crying in 
[02:51:30]  their face.  I've never dry-faced cried.  My face is always wet when I cry.  Yeah.  And there's a lot of actors who cannot do that.  How strange is it that we really appreciate people...  No, that would be a smile.  How crazy that we really appreciate people who are really good at faking shit?  That's, like, a huge skill.  Well, I like my wife.  Like, to fake emotions.  That's why I love my wife.  The sir was such a huge part of that line right there.  Kevin rules.  Made it.  Yep. 
[02:52:00]  That made it.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, we are.  We're just, like...  It's crazy.  We're obsessed with people who are great at lying.  And the better the liar, the more we appreciate it.  The better you can go into some crazy, psychotic state.  Like, your father didn't just fucking die and you're sitting here crying.  Like, you're crazy.  Oh, you're putting yourself in that place for the film.  You're fucking nuts.  You're a liar.  Yeah, you're awesome at faking it.  Well, movies are the best ever at faking it.  If they do it in cutaways, it's really easy to cry.  There's this thing called a mentholated blower.  It's essentially that thing, like, you know, you stick up your nose and inhaler to... 
[02:52:30]  Yes.  ...if your nose is blocked.  Basically, they drill a little hole on the other end of it and then blow from one end to the other  into your open eyes and immediately tear up.  What kind of cheesy-ass shit is that?  And they're putting Barry Bonds in jail?  What the fuck?  That's like steroids for acting.  I know.  He's a fucking liar.  It is, man.  And you know what's also good about it?  It doesn't just make your eyes wet.  It gives you the fucking runny nose of crying.  Wow.  The whole deal. 
[02:53:00]  The whole fact.  But then you still got to do the mouth thing and make your funny crying face.  Lip quiver.  Make your funny crying face.  Yeah, I do it.  The lip quiver makes everybody go, okay, calm down.  Calm down.  You hate a dude and his lips quivering.  You're like, calm down, dude.  All right.  I do it like Caligula.  I relax, bro.  It's like the ultimate, like, tail tuck.  Like, your lips are quivering.  I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing.  I'm sorry.  I'm like, all right, man.  It's okay.  It's okay, dude.  Calm down, dude.  It helps if you've got a few extra chins, too, because you get that jowl. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, the jowl starts rumbling.  And if you get some spittle and not even pay attention to it, you know, you're letting it  dribble down your face.  You don't care.  You know who does a good, like, really out of his mind crying because there's spit strings  and everything, and when he's talking is Giovanni Ribisi.  Yeah.  He will be crying.  And shit's flying out of his mouth.  Tears, snot.  Isn't he a Scientologist?  I have no idea. 
[02:54:00]  Isn't he one of those?  I believe.  Well, he always plays the retarded whatever in a movie.  Like, he's a retarded soldier.  When you're auditing a class in Scientology, the first thing the teachers have to cry convincingly.  Really?  That's because when you see how much you're giving them, you'll know how to react.  How crazy is that whole process where they hold on to the e-meters?  The little meters, yeah.  Coffee cans and strings.  Anything that keeps people off a building with a fucking sniper rifle, I'm okay.  You ever see the picture of young John Travolta holding on to those things, and he's like, 
[02:54:30]  you know, hey, I can't believe I'm doing this.  Well, the craziest rumor that I ever heard about Scientology was the Richard Gere gerbil  rumor, was that the reason why Richard Gere, which is the craziest fucking rumor of all  time.  The Richard Gere gerbil rumor is like unbelievable.  This is before the internet.  I mean, I grew up in Boston.  My friend grew up in LA.  We're both the same age.  We both heard it at the same time.  How did that have been?  It's fucking insane.  Like a messenger with wings on his heels, running across the country with a scroll.  I just saw something crazy.  Hear ye, hear ye. 
[02:55:00]  There's no rumor like that.  The Rod Stewart sperm rumor was the only one.  Yeah, that's up there.  That's up there.  It was also Rod Stewart.  It was Elton John.  And later in life, it was Jon Bon Jovi.  I always heard that story.  I only never heard the Bon Jovi one.  What was the Bon Jovi one?  Same thing.  But that one was true.  He was sucking so many dicks at a party that he had to pump his stomach from all of them.  Yeah, Rod Stewart.  I heard Bon Jovi had to eat.  Those rumors persist even pre-internet and travel because it captures a child's imagination.  The gerbil just made everybody go, what the fuck? 
[02:55:30]  How did the gerbil thing pass like that, though?  How did that happen?  That's just amazing.  That is amazing.  It's amazing.  It traveled the whole country.  It traveled everywhere.  Were people writing letters and licking envelopes and going, I've got to send this to my friend.  Like regular mail.  Richard Gere is a...  From father to son, mother to daughter.  Yeah.  That's right.  Housekeeper.  Rodent to rodent.  Richard Gere was a really handsome man and any opportunity that America had to hate on him.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I heard.  It just shows how many haters are out there. 
[02:56:00]  They just spread it like wildfire.  I still believe it.  You think so?  Yes.  Really?  100%.  I think when he went to Buddhism, Scientology released it.  My friend, Steve, used to work in the Miami hospital.  He was to work in the...  He was a resident.  He's an ophthalmologist.  He worked in the intensive care.  And he said he saw everything on people's asses.  Everything.  Light bulbs.  Guns.  Guns.  Guns.  Stuck up guys' assholes.  We've seen the x-rays, man.  Oh, fucking insane.  That was some gun.  Yeah.  Guns stuck up your asshole.  Stuck.  Loaded?  Yeah. 
[02:56:30]  Of course.  Like pistols.  They're shoving a pistol in the ass and it gets wrecked in there.  If you're going to do it, it should be loaded.  It's fucking crazy.  We had x-rays.  We had a chill out of x-rays that some guy brought in of guys with shit up, things up their ass.  And one was a bowling trophy.  Yeah, that was our favorite.  That was our favorite.  The bowling trophy had hooked itself, you know, because he was on his back throat.  It had hooked himself on, like, his pelvis bone.  So he couldn't get it back out.  It was like a molly bolt up his ass. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, my God.  Was it at least a first place?  Molly bolts.  I can't even listen to that.  Yeah, he had to.  I know.  Isn't that just painful?  I know.  Yeah, they had to do a little finagling to get that out of it.  Another trophy I can understand.  Like, if he had just won something and the arms were raised, at least you can kind of understand  the physics of wanting to put a raised arm trophy in your ass.  But when an arm is hooked back, that's a recipe for trouble.  Yeah, you're going to get into some trouble in there.  Maybe it was his dad's bowling trophy and he just wanted to shove his dad up his ass. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, yeah, like, look, look, dad.  Sort of a reverse Oedipus sort of thing.  I was in an emergency room, not personally for the problem, but for an impacted fecal  matter problem.  Powerful.  My wife had had some thyroid surgery and for a week she was taking Vicodin.  Apparently one of the side effects is it prevents you from shitting for a while.  And she got to the point where, like, she was doubled over, sick, she felt like she was  being poisoned, like toxic poisoning.  I kept saying, let's go to the hospital, let's go to the hospital.  She's like, no, no.  And I went out and got, like, you know, the little enemas you can buy, all that shit. 
[02:58:00]  Nothing worked.  And finally she conceded.  And we took her to the emergency room and the doctor had her get her, it was so horrible,  had her get her on her hands and knees and use a long speculum, a shovel to just dig  it out.  Holy Jesus Christ.  I don't know.  Wow.  And the one thing she said after it was all over was, like, never tell anybody.  How long did it take?  I think once she got into the room it was about a half an hour. 
[02:58:30]  Because once they kind of did half the blockage, then immediately, you know, boom, you're set  to pop.  Oh my God.  Was it really, like, what if eventually you would shit, right?  It was all impacted, like, it was too big to come out.  It just impacted and just fucking blew out her upper intestine.  You should have gotten high off that.  Her lower intestine's upper colon.  It was just, he said it was like a massive fucking cork.  Oh God.  You can die from that because you're backed up.  Sure.  You start getting the headaches and all.  Yeah.  What do you do if you're on a deserted island and you fucking can't shit?  Oh, you're done. 
[02:59:00]  Deserted island.  How fucking old are you?  Well, it's not hilarious.  It happened on Survivor.  Both the question and the response were hilarious.  A guy on a teeny island with one palm tree.  Exactly.  That's what you're thinking.  And a bloated stomach full of shit.  That exact thing happened on one of the survivors.  I forgot which one.  And the guy had to leave the game because he was going to die.  They had to get him to a hospital.  Couldn't you put, like, fucking Metamucil in there or some warm water or put your finger  up there?  There's got to be a way to scoop your duty out. 
[02:59:30]  What about colonics?  I think it was too high for a finger to reach.  But why didn't you sit there and push until it happens?  I was like, let me help out.  It's probably above those sphincter muscles.  Got a fucking...  I don't take Vicodin.  I've taken Vicodin a little bit.  If you're on the desert island and you're impacted that badly and there's nobody with  a speculum to dig your shit out of your ass, you can wade into the ocean and pray to get  eaten by a shark.  I know.  You imagine if that's the one thing you're looking forward to in society, a guy with  a shovel and a fucking table to get on your hands and knees on? 
[03:00:00]  You could get into the water, spread your ass cheeks and hope for the...  The Bermuda shit-eating fish.  Just maybe pick away.  Bunch of piranhas.  Take away.  My kingdom for a shovel in my asshole.  Brother Weiss tells a story every once in a while.  He was in such a state on the bowl, he couldn't get it out, but it was half out that he had  to cut it loose.  Cut it?  Cut it loose with scissors, yeah.  Scissors?  What?  Wait, he stood up to go get scissors?  Or did he have them in reach?  I guess he waddled and got scissors. 
[03:00:30]  He couldn't get the whole turd out, so...  That is insane.  How did he wipe?  It took him three weeks to wipe the ball.  But he figured, fuck, I'll just like...  Scissors?  Why did he just grab it?  Yeah, use his hand.  Yeah, just get in there.  Oh, he also...  Shout at it.  I don't know if it's the same story, but he did also say that it was so...  One time it was so hard, maybe it was after he cut it.  What the fuck?  It wouldn't go down the fucking toilet, so he had to go in there and squish it up.  Oh, my God.  I don't know, man.  He swears it's true, but he cut it loose because he couldn't sit there anymore. 
[03:01:00]  He's like, fuck this, I'll come back and try to get this done later.  You know which ones hurt?  The fucking knobby-headed turds?  Yeah.  They look like the Michelin Man, but thin and brown.  It looks like 50 small donuts put together and then fucking shaped into a log.  Kevin, sometimes your shit comes out and it's just like you go to wipe your ass and there's  nothing there, man.  Nothing.  It's like, how did that happen?  Just a speck of blood and a little semen.  I think worse than that is when you get the breech shit going where it's turned the wrong  way.  The breech, yes.  Breech shit.  I know exactly what he's talking about.  You can feel it moving through your whole insides. 
[03:01:30]  Like, holy shit.  It has a protein pointing head down.  It's on its side.  Yes.  Yes.  It's like a great situation.  It's like watching Tor Johnson walk into a room.  I was drinking.  Those are the only times I pray now is when that stuff happens.  I was drinking this goji berry juice and you're not supposed to drink too much of it.  You're supposed to drink like one ounce of it.  It's got strong antioxidants.  I was drinking like a fucking glass of it, right?  And I kept getting these unbelievable, like, I said like it was like a dirty turtle tank. 
[03:02:00]  That's what my shit was like.  You know, like your turtle tank when you don't clean it.  Those motherfuckers just eating and shitting everywhere.  It just came out of my asshole.  It smelled like a stinky, neglected turtle tank.  It smelled the same way until I stopped taking this fucking goji juice.  I was like, I don't care if I get healthy.  By the way, Kevin.  It was just horrible, explosive, broken fire hydrant diarrhea.  Is it good for you though?  Yeah, it's great for you.  Get a copy of this broadcast and play it for those people that say the show is immature and juvenile. 
[03:02:30]  Talk about shit for fucking 20 minutes.  Well, Kevin, what's the big plug?  We got to take a break here.  We got the Smodcast tomorrow at 710.  That's a little weird.  Smodcast tomorrow night.  Smodcast, right.  On 202, the virus.  And we cast our Zach and Mary, Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks.  That is nice.  You guys that call in with it and there it is.  Very cool.  All right, well, Kevin, it's always, always a pleasure.  And I look forward to seeing you.  Always a pleasure, sir.  If I don't see you in the studio beforehand, I'll see you on the set. 
[03:03:00]  Hey, you rule, dude.  It was an honor to talk to you.  Big fan.  Hey, Kev, where are we shooting?  We're shooting Pittsburgh, sir.  Good, good, good.  Yeah, not too far.  So this is real now with Jimmy because it kind of started as a little bit of a bit, but it's real now, right, Kevin?  It's very real.  As long as Jimmy Prime, he can't come in the next day to the show and be like, that was not worth the trip.  No, not at all.  No, you bash Kevin Smith.  I will bash you.  You bash Kevin.  No, you got his word.  No, I'm fucking good, man.  Yeah, we're not stupid.  God damn it. 
[03:03:30]  I told you to bring me the formula.  That's a guy who needs the formula.  He's right in the line.  He's available for ad-libbing.  I'm fucking good, man.  Believe me, I'll help you.  I'll go over the whole script, make a few changes.  Yeah, he's really helpful.  Any poker games in the future?  I think I'm going to play another one in the next two weeks of Jersey.  Cool.  Do you play well high?  I'm sorry?  Do you play well when you're high? 
[03:04:00]  I didn't that night.  Making some stupid moves.  Ari Jaffir is a killer poker player.  Seven deuce off.  This will work sometime.  It's got to come out of the flop eventually.  You're eating a jack.  Ari's been winning big money playing in L.A. tournaments.  Really?  How much big money?  We're going to play Commerce?  Commerce, yeah.  Commerce hustler.  He's a killer, man.  He takes on big cash.  Nice.  Spend 12 sometimes.  I forgot to tell you.  I started playing online as a goof.  And I had like a 2-7 offsuit.  And I decided to go all in, right? 
[03:04:30]  And it didn't work out, obviously.  No.  And then you watch everyone leave the roof.  That's my new thing.  Just go all in on the worst hand and see how pissed people get.  You just see people disappear before your eyes around the whole table.  Wait, why would you sit there by yourself in this room?  Why would they leave?  In that room.  That's where you don't it.  No, they don't want to deal with people that don't.  They don't want to play with a lucky fuck that will get like a 7-7 deuce on the flop.  They want to play with real players.  So if you're going all in with 2-7, they don't want to.  You're too wild.  Yeah, they don't want to deal with that. 
[03:05:00]  They want a real game where people are thinking it out and stuff.  It's funny where Blackjack is the only game where you have to count on the other people with you not to fuck up and do anything crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah, like if you're at a table, that's nuts.  I've been at a table where I wanted to kill somebody.  That's crazy.  Why?  It's like, don't fucking hit that fucking 13.  The deal is showing at 6.  Don't fucking hit it.  And then your theory is they mess up a deck for everyone else?  Yeah.  That's retarded.  Wait, don't hit that deck.  It is retarded.  It doesn't change any odds.  When it works out in your favor, then what do you say? 
[03:05:30]  But statistically, it doesn't.  No.  It drives players nuts.  It drives them nuts.  Look, here's the deal.  If I got a fucking $6,000 bet up top and some motherfucker with a quarter is sitting there fucking my hand up, I could fucking tell him to hit or not hit on whatever I fucking want.  Well, they fuck you up, though.  But it doesn't make sense.  He's right.  It doesn't make sense.  Statistically, it doesn't matter what at all.  Yeah.  Everybody follows that, though.  Everyone follows that.  The next card that comes up is completely random, whether it's the first card or the third card or the fourth card. 
[03:06:00]  It doesn't matter.  What do you think the origin of blaming the person for your loss is?  It's the same people that blame, you know, whites for slavery.  I think that origin.  I don't know.  Wait, what, Kev?  I think that origin goes back to the beginning of time.  Yeah.  It really does.  Even Blackjack.  That's just like, it was his fault.  The first fucking person that went up, and the first person that pointed at a wild animal and told his friend,  I think you could fuck that.  And then he got his dick ripped off, and he goes, I'm blaming you. 
[03:06:30]  That's what a shock that I go there.  No, no, completely unpredictable of me, just to go into a cheap fuck joke.  But you're going to be on set with Kevin Smith.  How cool is that?  That's going to make you mainstream.  All right.  Hey, Kevin, always a pleasure.  Always a pleasure, gents.  All right.  We'll see you soon in studio.  Tomorrow night, 710, this podcast with Kevin Smith and Scott Moser.  There you go.  Later on, guys.  Take care, buddy.  Later, man.  Greatest fucking Kevin.  I love Kevin, man.  He really is.  He's hilarious.  He's very funny.  I think I got an idea.  All right.  Do you want me to confirm it?  Yeah, confirm.  Yeah. 
[03:07:00]  I'll hold up the sign.  Yeah, he plays a...  I don't know.  You got a maker...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, because it was like too easy.  I just want to...  I want to let the audience...  He plays poker at his comic book store sometimes.  Oh, really?  Yeah, sets up a table and invites over message board people and fans of his movies and shit.  And we would sit there fucking until the sun comes up and just play cards and fleece our  fans of all their money.  It's fantastic.  Very nice. 
[03:07:30]  He's a very accessible celebrity.  Oh, he is.  And he's a real celebrity, man.  Really?  Yeah.  He's huge.  Yeah.  He's got a gigantic cult following.  He's genuinely funny.  He seems so normal.  Yeah, he is.  He's a regular dude.  He's so rare.  Totally is.  Absolutely.  So rare.  His speech on what happened with Superman.  Did you ever see that?  Oh, yeah.  It was fucking brilliant.  Fantastic.  It was just awesome.  The story about what happened, how he couldn't write Superman.  There's DVDs of him just going around and talking at colleges and he's fucking hysterical,  man.  Real natural.  He's the one where some kid says something stupid about Predictable K. 
[03:08:00]  And he just levels him.  He fucking owned him.  He just owned him.  And he did it self-deprecating at the same time.  Yeah, yeah.  Very funny.  It's like a comic.  I want to go to break because I want to set something up here.  She can't hear, right?  We think we have an idea for Stalker Patty.  Yeah.  I want to make Stalker Patty believe she's on dope.  Okay.  It's real easy.  You still got one of those strips?  Oh, of course I do.  Okay.  I got the regular ones.  The real ones.  We're going to attempt to get her to do one of these, say, her breath's bad from all 
[03:08:30]  the coffee, blah, blah, blah.  And then you're going to pull the big reveal of what she really took.  Although she really is just eating a regular breath strip.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How healthy is she?  She's fine.  No, we don't want her to actually do it.  She's a world-class athlete.  What if she has a heart attack?  What if she freaks out?  We'll just tell us a lie.  I mean, for real, when people don't do drugs and you tell them that they're on drugs,  I'm just saying.  I'm just saying.  Well, you guys have already been spending months for a month for fucking with Condoleezza  Rice.  I don't want you to kill some fucking homeless lady.  We've also taken a jackhammer to her cunt. 
[03:09:00]  So, I mean, that didn't cause a heart attack.  Except for the jackhammer.  There's so little respect for her vagina.  Yeah.  Cunt.  No, there's not a lot of that.  You're actually...  Not even the behavior.  Her cunt.  Right?  The fucking cunt hole.  Lack of respect is she...  Wait, I'll...  Will you say that?  Her cunt?  I very rarely call a girl's pussy a cunt.  It's always the behavior that's a cunt.  It's the meat around it.  Yeah, exactly.  That is the cunt.  I rarely say that word, but with her...  I mean, she doesn't respect her own vagina, so...  No? 
[03:09:30]  52 years old and never had anything in it, for the most part.  Is this bad?  I call a vagina a hairy toilet.  That's not bad.  Toilets are pretty.  The old hairy toilet.  So, we're going to try this next, okay?  All right.  We're going to try that next, and we've got other things with Joe Rogan, who's at Caroline's  tonight at 1230 with Ari.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Burn!  Burn!  Get chock on the burn!  Burn!  Burn!  Yes, I'm gonna burn!  Burn!  Burn!  Yes, I'm gonna burn!  Burn!  Burn! 
[03:10:00]  Yes, I'm gonna burn!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Joe Rogan in studio with Ari.  Caroline's tonight at 1230.  It's Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio.  I can't tell you guys how much I've been looking forward to coming here and doing this.  It's been too long, man.  It has been too long.  I'm never in town enough.  I fucking look forward to it like crazy.  I'm down here for the UFC, and I'm down here to do a gig with Ari tonight, but I was  looking forward to this more than anything.  Yeah, just tag him.  I always have a great fucking time.  You want to go solo at noon?  Not noon, at 11?  I don't think we can. 
[03:10:30]  I think we've got to get out of here.  We've got to go until 12, and then we've got to be gone by 12.  Oh, we can do it until 12?  I'm just thinking.  Until they pick us up at 12, right?  I think they pick us up at 12.  Yeah, we've got to go back to the hotel and get our shit.  All right, no worries.  In New Jersey, we've got to go to Newark.  Saturday, yeah, tomorrow night.  So the weigh-ins are today, though.  That's the thing.  Wait, at the New Joint?  Yeah.  I'm going there tonight for a hockey game.  I can't wait to check it out.  That's crazy.  They've got a hockey game there tonight, and then they're going to have the fights tomorrow?  Oh, yeah.  That's fucking insane.  They've got to break and put up the octagon.  Are they going to fight on the ice? 
[03:11:00]  Maybe it's UFC on ice.  And it's totally the same place, for sure?  Yeah.  Wow.  Unless there's maybe two different areas.  I haven't been down there.  I know.  It was on top of a hockey ring.  Yeah, yeah, no, for sure.  But I'm saying the octagon takes a while to set up.  Yeah.  Hey, let's get Stalker Patty in here real fast.  Hi, Big Kev.  Hi, Big Kev.  Can someone tell Big Kev's hair looks like Hitler?  Where's the thing?  That's a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think it looks good.  Stalker Patty, get her or Mike over here.  Patty, we got some ideas for you today. 
[03:11:30]  Hi, Big Eddie.  We got some kind of nice jeans.  Hi.  What kind of jeans are those?  Just regular jeans.  Cheap ones.  Diesel?  Those are nice.  Thank you.  You got a cool thing to them.  Patty, are you like acid washed a little bit?  You know what it is, though?  Your hips are stretching them out like a fucking shoe tree.  Are you kidding?  Your fucking ass is getting wider every time I see you, Patty.  Anthony, come on.  But it is.  Fatter.  I'm not fat.  Oh, fatter.  I only weigh 116 pounds. 
[03:12:00]  I'm talking about your ass.  Yeah.  Wow.  Patty, Patty.  What?  Do you need money?  Why?  Just asking.  Are you short on funds?  What is it this month?  Is it rent?  How much money do you need, do you think?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't want to make it.  I'm embarrassed.  Oh, don't be shy.  We're all friends.  Yeah.  You're amongst friends.  You're amongst friends, Ricky.  Ricky.  I don't know.  By the way, are you drinking coffee?  I love that.  That's a my bodyguard reference. 
[03:12:30]  Hold on.  You're drinking coffee, though?  Yeah.  People are saying that you have really bad breath.  Yeah.  It's all the coffee.  Do you have any more of those breast chips?  I have a few in front of me.  Do you?  Give me one, too.  Do you brush your teeth and floss and stuff?  Of course I do.  I went to the dentist the last time.  I was perfect.  I didn't even need another visit at all.  Yeah.  Oh, that's good.  He said you don't need to visit forever again.  Dr. Zell.  He tried to drill her teeth, but they're too small for the drill to hit. 
[03:13:00]  Patty, have you ever tried the breath strips?  No, I've never had those.  I use Lifesavers.  Oh, really?  You want to try one of these?  They're really good.  To do what?  Lifesavers are sugar.  They don't help your breath.  I don't know if I'll like it.  I don't like a lot of sweets.  They're interesting.  They're not sweet.  It's like a Listerine.  No, it actually instantly makes your mouth feel fresh.  Yeah, it's like a mouthwash, but it's in like a little strip.  You put it in your mouth and it kills all the bad bacteria. 
[03:13:30]  Patty, it's a sponsor.  Play along.  Yeah, put it in your tongue.  See?  Like that.  And watch.  Is it like candy or something?  No.  No, it dissolves instantly.  And it gives you like a, it makes your breath just feel much better.  Try one.  It's like a communion wafer.  Just one.  She loves to taste the communion wafer, Father.  Just one.  There you go.  That's fine.  It feels weird.  Did you give her a whole one?  Tastes like wintergreen.  Yeah.  Why'd you give her a whole one?  Give her a second.  Did you just?  No.  You should have given a half.  Let it swallow. 
[03:14:00]  It's not bad.  It's a little bit of a, what's wrong, Patty?  I don't like it.  I don't think that giving her a whole one was a good idea.  No.  Probably half would have been good for the first time.  I think this is a bad.  I'm getting tears in my eyes.  Well, that's the beginning.  Patty, it's going to get a lot worse.  Patty, we have to tell you something.  What?  Oh, boy.  This wasn't my idea.  What you got was actually a medical marijuana strip.  That's what it is.  And what it is, it's like liquid THC, which is the active ingredient in marijuana, and it 
[03:14:30]  comes in a little form, like a breast strip.  You just ate pot.  And we just gave it to you.  I know I did.  You ate pot in its purest form.  In its purest form.  Which is not even the pot.  It's the drug that makes pot a drug.  And it takes...  I hope not.  No, you did.  You did.  And you're not going to feel it.  I have a heart condition with an irregular rhythm.  No, no, no.  This is probably going to be good for you.  Why?  It's probably going to be good for you.  It's going to...  No, this will relax you.  It's going to come.  It's going to come.  It's going to come. 
[03:15:00]  It's going to come.  It's going to come now.  It's like...  Well, listen.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the beginning, Patty.  You'll start feeling tingly.  It is.  Nothing to panic about.  Your heart's going to be fine.  You're going to be fine.  But we'll talk you through it.  We're not going anywhere.  We're going to be here with you the whole time.  You're going to take a little trip, Patty.  You're not going to take...  What do you mean, a little trip?  It'll be a good trip.  This is how I'll explain to you the effects.  It's going to take about 15 minutes before you really start to feel it.  Right now, your body is recognizing that there's a new agent in your body, a new chemical agent.  It's moving through your central nervous system.  Yeah.  That's what's going on.  You want to sit down? 
[03:15:30]  It's going through your bloodstream, and your brain is processing it.  And in the next 15 to 20 minutes, you're going to start to feel really euphoric, and  your body's going to start to feel wonderful, and your imagination's going to be racing and  running, and then you're going to be high.  Tell us what you're feeling so far.  I've never been high before.  Well, you're going to be...  You're going to be real high.  You are really...  Really, really high.  You're going to be safe.  You're not going to be hurt.  You don't have to worry about your health at all.  It's very, very safe.  Right.  In 10,000 years of use, it's never killed a single living human being, ever. 
[03:16:00]  That's right.  Everything you hear about that is just propaganda.  Patty, you're a virgin.  You're 52 or so.  It's time for some new experiences.  That's all.  Tell us what you're feeling so far.  It's been about five minutes.  Do you feel anything yet?  You probably should be feeling a little something at this point.  The mouth thing goes away, and then it really starts to take effect.  Yeah.  You're going to feel a little relaxed.  What do you feel like?  You feel relaxed?  I feel like I want to sit down.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you?  All right.  Why don't you grab that microphone?  That would do it.  Take the microphone and just sit down in that seat right there.  I feel like numb. 
[03:16:30]  You probably should sit down, too, because if it's your first time.  You feel numb?  And Mike is heavy, isn't it?  All right.  If it's your first time, you should sit down.  Why don't you sit down over there?  You all right?  Are you okay?  Wow, look at her eyes, man.  Look at her eyes.  Look at her eyes.  Look at her eyes.  Patty, you can so touch her eyes.  Yeah, a little bit.  Look at that.  Come under the eye.  You're really high.  The pupils are really small.  Come back over here.  Let's look at your eyes under the light.  Look at her eyes.  Slow.  Slow.  Joe's a professional at this.  Slow.  Slow.  Oh, my God.  She's so high.  Look at her eyes.  It's crazy.  Holy crap, man.  Holy shit.  Look at her eyes. 
[03:17:00]  Patty, what's going on?  Take a seat.  Patty.  To be honest with us, Patty, what are you feeling right now?  Scared.  Yeah, but do you feel high?  I feel weird.  Are you getting-  You feel like it's coming on?  Like it's starting to happen?  You know what it is?  It's like a sugar deficiency.  When I get low in my blood sugar, I get that same feeling.  Same feeling?  Yeah.  When I do get low in my blood sugar a lot.  You know when you get dizzy and you have to sit down? 
[03:17:30]  Why are you laughing?  That's not funny.  Why are you laughing?  What?  Why are you laughing?  How does it feel now through your legs?  Yeah.  Except when you're sitting.  Explain, like, stand up again, because you get a much better feeling when you're standing.  What?  Wait a minute.  Let's not encourage too much movement.  Yeah, careful.  Yeah, be careful when you stand up.  Very slowly, very slowly.  You could fall off.  Do you feel a little wobbly?  Why'd you sit right back down? 
[03:18:00]  Oh, man.  I can't.  Listen, you don't have to get up.  You're having trouble standing up?  It's going to wear off in about three hours, and you're going to be fine.  So just sit in that seat.  Just relax.  No big deal.  Just relax.  The show's going to go on, and you'll just enjoy it.  It's going to get worse before it gets better, though.  Yeah.  So you're going to feel like you might see some hallucinations.  Yeah.  Like what?  Are you seeing anything?  Well, it's stuff that is in your imagination.  Yeah, just describe what you're seeing right now.  What do you think about?  That's a little different.  I don't know. 
[03:18:30]  Usually I've been having trouble seeing, but now my vision's a little clearer.  She's so fucked up.  You are fucked up.  You can't even.  She's got the clear vision.  You're not even coherent.  Look at her eyes.  What?  What were you just trying to say?  You weren't even making sense.  Do you see her eyes?  No, I'm saying everything is clearer.  Clearer.  You are slurring your speech so bad.  I like where she's going with this.  Holy shit.  I like where she's going with this.  You're slurring your speech.  You said clearer.  Everything's clearer.  Clearer, yeah.  Nobody heard anything you said, though. 
[03:19:00]  What?  You're talking weird.  We heard you say clearer.  Patty.  No, I'm saying.  Patty.  What does this feel like?  You sound a little strange, Patty.  I feel tired.  Patty.  Are you tired?  Patty, what does this make you think about?  Why don't you lean your head back a little bit?  Do you think about your childhood?  No.  I'm in the here and now. 
[03:19:30]  All right.  All right, Patty.  So focus, focus, focus, focus.  Dude, how fucked up is she?  She is so fucking high right now.  This is crazy to watch.  Crazy to watch.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Are you okay?  Patty, what's wrong?  I'm fine.  What's wrong?  You just cursed, Patty.  You said, holy shit.  What did you feel?  What's the matter?  You felt the next stage of you kicking in, didn't you?  Patty, just relax.  Now stand up.  No, don't stand up.  Let her try.  Let her do it.  Try to stand.  Try to stand. 
[03:20:00]  How's that feel?  I've got to sit back down.  That's the fourth dimension.  We're going to the fourth dimension right now.  You think she's going there already?  Yeah, what happens when you stand up?  I feel dizzy and I've got to sit down.  All right.  Remember, your heart's fine.  This is going to put you in a nice, relaxed state, okay?  So your vision is much better at this point.  Well, yeah.  And you feel tired?  Oh, what's the matter?  You feel sick?  Well, not tired.  No, no.  Did you feel sick?  I saw you burp a little.  What's going to happen, it makes you feel like you have to evacuate. 
[03:20:30]  You might have to shit, but that's perfectly normal.  That's part of the high.  I'd have to shit.  Well, I don't have to do number two, but I do have to do number one.  Oh, my God.  That's how it starts.  That's how it starts.  It's phantom number twos.  You go to take a piss, and then the shit will just come tumbling at your ass.  Where the fuck did that come from?  You are so high, Patty.  Well, she's on her way.  You can tell.  You can tell.  She's got the old start of the mouth when the mouth starts opening.  Yeah.  Because you're like, hurr.  And you're breathing all funny. 
[03:21:00]  Patty, you're fucked up.  I told them.  I told them to give her you a half.  Yeah.  A whole one is really.  I've never taken a whole one.  Why are you laughing, Patty?  Yeah, Ari is a grown man.  He's 190 pounds, and he can't handle a whole one.  Why are you laughing, Patty?  I can't help it.  Hey, Patty, now listen to me.  You're getting, I think you're getting close to like, white glass.  You're paranoid.  I would just be able to hear better.  They're all paranoid.  That's the way you can hear all of us.  Now, Patty, do me a favor.  What?  Joe Rogan is the expert on this stuff, so listen to him. 
[03:21:30]  Listen to him.  He's going to talk to you a little bit.  What is this?  That's the thing.  Oh, my God, Patty.  What do you mean, what's that?  You are so wasted.  That's a microphone with the battery pack.  You talk to it.  Ow.  Oh, man.  That's so weird watching you.  Crazy fucking.  Patty, I can't believe you're doing this.  It is weird to watch somebody go from totally stone sober to completely fucked up.  Well, how about someone who's never done anything in their entire life, and now they're doing it on the radio? 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, this is cool.  This is the first experience on the radio.  This could be your best moment on the show ever.  You're not a virgin doing drugs anymore, Patty.  You're not a virgin anymore, Patty.  Hmm, that's pretty crazy.  Are you getting horny at all?  Are you getting horny at all?  Are you getting horny at all?  No, I just feel kind of dizzy.  No, I just feel kind of dizzy.  Do you, but you said you feel clearer.  You said you feel clearer.  Well, I see clearer, but when I get up, I feel, I feel, I feel, I, I, I, wait a minute.  Wait, I hear my echo.  I hear my echo.  Stand up.  What?  What? 
[03:22:30]  There's not a lot of equipment.  What are you talking about you hearing echo?  Patty, stand up.  Stand up.  Let me see how you feel.  Just stand up a little bit.  Joe, would you be very, very slow and deliberate in your movements?  Hold on.  How do your legs feel?  Hold on.  She's like, Joe, is it true that she would hear an echo or something?  That's kind of crazy.  It's possible.  You know, you know what?  Her brain might be over flooding with information.  It's just rebounding off the synapses.  That's very possible.  Really?  I, when I used to do it all the time and the echo to me was always like the start of the 
[03:23:00]  really good high.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  Did you do the pot?  Did you smoke the pot, Jim?  Yeah.  I only did the breath strip once, but it was too intense.  Did you do a whole one?  No.  I would never do a whole one.  It was always a half.  Only a half would I do.  Only a half.  I couldn't imagine doing a whole one.  Never do a whole one.  My first time.  Never do a whole one.  My first time doing a whole one.  That's fucking crazy.  Wait a minute.  I can't tell who's talking and who's not. 
[03:23:30]  You did a whole one.  That's insane.  Why?  You did a whole one.  Why?  Because I hear roll echoes.  I don't know if you're saying why.  Never do a whole one.  Patty, focus on me.  Right here.  Focus on me.  You did a whole one, Patty.  Are you feeling okay, Patty?  I'm feeling weird.  You did a whole one.  You did a whole one.  You did a whole one, Jim.  Why is everybody just staring at her?  You did a whole one, Patty.  Why would you do a whole one when we told you only do a half?  You did a whole one.  I thought I was taking a breath strip. 
[03:24:00]  No, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  You did a whole one.  You did a whole one.  You knew what you were doing.  You certainly did.  You feel okay?  You knew what was going to happen when you woke up this morning.  You knew how this day was going to progress.  You've known about it your whole life.  Oh, my God.  You're looking weird.  You dreamed of this day.  I know.  You knew it was coming.  You knew it was coming.  You knew it was coming.  Feed your head, Patty. 
[03:24:30]  Today is the day it all comes together.  Wow.  You are stoned.  Patty, what's up?  My arm is light.  Of course it is.  I know that's going to float around.  Let it float around.  Let it float around right now.  Yeah, just go with it, Patty.  Lift it up.  Lift your arm up.  Lift it up.  Try to lift it up.  Now hold it up.  Why are you dropping it fast like that?  One thing you should be really careful of, don't close your eyes and lie back, because  you might just go to sleep instantly.  Which is okay, by the way.  Deep, deep sleep.  It's crazy.  A lot of time, first-time users on cannabis, the first time they do it, when they lie back 
[03:25:00]  and close their eyes, even just for a second, they'll wake up like three hours later  and they can't believe it.  And people will be saying, dude, we were poking you.  We were trying to wake you up.  We couldn't wake you up.  Put a ball bag on your face.  Don't lean back, because if you lean back, you could be asleep from three to five hours.  Yeah.  Like, completely unconscious.  So stay away.  You don't have to work today, do you, Patty?  Stay away.  No.  Don't freak out.  Don't freak out.  Listen, don't freak out.  You'll be fine.  Yeah, stop freaking out.  I do have to meet my friends at five for dinner before going over. 
[03:25:30]  Oh, boy.  You might want to text message that chick.  What kind of dinner are you having?  You already ate a whole one.  No, I didn't.  I didn't eat.  I think I ate an egg this morning.  Oh, my God.  She can't even talk.  I ate an egg this morning.  You can't even talk.  You can't talk, Patty.  Patty, what's the matter with you?  Why can't you talk?  I am talking.  What?  Your voice is all, like, slurring.  Let's get a slow or something.  Now I'm shaking.  Your voice.  Are you?  I can hear nothing you're saying.  Put your hand out.  Let me see your hand. 
[03:26:00]  Oh, whoa.  Wow.  Put your hand out.  Let me see.  Hold your hand out.  All right, Patty, try to stand up now.  Keith, we got Keith the cop in studio.  He'll make sure nothing happens to you.  Wow.  Let Keith go near you just in case you start to fall over.  Oh, she's almost, guys.  All right, stand straight up.  How are you feeling?  I want to sit back down again.  All right, sit back down again.  Sit back down again.  That's normal.  That's very normal, Patty.  Wow, Patty, hold your hand out again.  Let me see your shaking.  Hold your hand out again.  Let me see your shaking.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Jesus Christ. 
[03:26:30]  Number nine.  I knew she shouldn't have done a whole one.  And I'm relaxing, too, and it's shaking.  Why does it shake like this?  How do you get that?  Patty, are you nervous?  Yeah, I hope it doesn't have health problems, you know?  Well, no, no, no.  Listen to Joe.  Listen to Joe.  You've seen people stoned like that.  But it's not dangerous at all.  In 10,000 years of people using it, no one's ever died from it.  Everything you hear about it, it's all bullshit and propaganda.  Yeah.  Because the government doesn't want you to experience this.  It just feels good, Patty. 
[03:27:00]  Lay back.  Just let it take over your body.  The government doesn't want you to become enlightened, Patty.  That's what it is.  The government wants to keep you dumb.  The government wants to keep you quiet.  You should.  The government's responsible for a lot of things.  It doesn't want you to smoke pot, Patty.  Yeah.  It doesn't want you to take the pot breath.  She took too much.  Patty, what do you think?  She definitely took too much.  Hold on.  Patty, what do you think?  I told you guys.  I told you.  What are you thinking about, Patty, right now?  I'm thinking how weird this is.  It's okay, though.  Just ride it out.  It's good. 
[03:27:30]  It's good for you.  You don't have a bad trip.  If you start thinking bad thoughts, you're going to have a bad trip.  Patty, no.  I'm just concerned about my heart.  No.  You're so okay.  You don't have to worry.  Patty, it's actually very, you know, it's medicine.  I mean, in California, the reason why they make these things is because it's thought of as medicine.  Medical marijuana is actually a state law, and they give it to people, a lot of people with heart conditions, because it relaxes them.  Yeah, so don't even worry about that part of it.  It's not dangerous at all.  It's actually healthy.  So it would be good for Fez, too, right?  It would be good for Fez, too.  Why are you slurring your words?  It's so weird.  I'm not slurring my words. 
[03:28:00]  Yes, you are.  Fez would even take a half.  You are slurring.  It's very hard to hear you.  You, you're slurring.  You're slurring so bad.  I'm talking, and you...  Patty, are you seeing dead people?  No.  All right, good.  That's good.  That's okay.  Let us know if you do, though, because then we...  Yeah, if you start seeing shit, we might have to...  Do you feel like spiders are crawling up your legs?  Because sometimes you can get that feeling.  You get, like, tingly...  No, just, like, a numbness.  Numbness.  You know, like, my arm and then my hands, and then the shaking in my hands, which I can't stop. 
[03:28:30]  The numbness is fine.  If that's what stays...  If it just stays numb, you're going to be fine.  The real problem is when it goes from numbness to really itchy.  Like, you're covered in bugs.  Yeah.  And it's very slow.  It happens very slow, where it's like you're numb, and everything feels fine, and then all  of a sudden you start getting some feeling back, but it's like there's bugs all over  you, and they won't stop fucking with you.  And they're everywhere.  They're up the crack of your ass.  They're in your feet.  They're under your legs. 
[03:29:00]  They're everywhere.  Behind your ears.  Behind your ears.  You just start getting...  You just start crating.  You just start crating.  Why are you scratching?  Why are you...  You need someone to talk you down.  Why are you scratching your legs?  I'm not scratching.  You look like you're scratching.  If you start getting itchy, just don't scratch.  Don't scratch.  Just relax.  Don't scratch.  I'm not scratching.  Just don't scratch.  You don't ever want to scratch.  Because if you start to scratch, it's going to feel really bizarre and uncomfortable.  But don't ever scratch. 
[03:29:30]  Patty.  Patty.  Patty, we're over here.  Don't scratch.  We're over here, Patty.  What's wrong with you?  Don't scratch.  I just saw a rabbit go by.  Just don't...  No, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  Just don't scratch.  She just saw a rabbit.  I did.  Come on.  What an idiot.  What the fuck did you just say?  Wait a minute.  That's Eric.  That's E-Rock.  Eric.  That's right.  Eric, she said you look like a rabbit.  He's not a rabbit.  Holy shit.  I saw a rabbit go by.  Patty, you are fucking stoned off your ass. 
[03:30:00]  You just saw a rabbit go by?  Are you crazy?  That's crazy.  That's a white rabbit with a colorful dick on him.  With a colorful what?  That's a white rabbit with a colorful thing on him, like red, blue, and yellow.  Well, you're scratching your knee.  I'm not scratching.  I saw you scratching.  If it itches, let us know because we might have to take care of you.  All right.  Try to stand up.  I want you to stand up.  Keith, help her out and walk to the couch and back.  Keith, don't hold her up.  Yeah, watch out for any white rabbits. 
[03:30:30]  If you start itching, let us know.  If you need to sit down, let us know.  But start walking toward the couch.  How are you feeling?  Whoa, whoa.  Try to walk a straight line.  You're a straight line, Patty.  I am walking a straight line.  No, you're not.  Yes, I am.  And you're all slow motion.  She's so fucked up.  I'm walking straight.  Oh, my God, Patty.  How are you feeling?  Why don't you lay down on that couch a little bit there?  For a second, that comfy couch.  How are you feeling?  I need to relax.  Yeah, you want to sing a song or anything for us? 
[03:31:00]  Why are you tense?  Yeah, it's all fun.  I don't know.  Do you know Indica DeVita?  Hey, Ari, maybe she needs a friend.  Why don't you sit next to her and cuddle with her?  No, I'm fine.  It's not good to be alone during these times.  Never.  You're right?  Why are you coughing?  I'm not coughing.  Ari's going to come over and sit next to you.  Who?  Ari.  Ari, Ari.  There's the rabbit again.  That's Ari.  That's Ari.  You are a mess, Patty. 
[03:31:30]  He's over there.  Stop pointing at the door.  Patty, Ari's sitting next to you.  What the fuck are you talking about?  Ari.  I'm right here.  I'm not going to leave you.  That's our intern.  You all right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Okay.  I'm not going to leave you.  It's all right.  God, Patty.  I've never seen someone that ate a full strip.  No.  And this is what it's like.  You are so stoned.  And you know what?  You're only 10 minutes into it.  It doesn't even really kick in until 15 minutes.  15 minutes in, you're really going to start to feel it. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, you're really going to feel it.  Patty, what's wrong?  What's the matter?  Tell us what you're feeling.  He's staring at me like I got two heads.  He's sitting next to you.  He's sitting next to you.  He's sitting next to you.  Who, the rabbit?  Whoa.  What are you talking about?  He's sitting next to me like I have two heads.  He's just sitting there comforting you.  He's looking around the room and stuff.  Will you stop?  He's relaxing next to you.  Just relax, please.  Patty, that's a symptom of marijuana use is you get really, really paranoid.  Paranoia, yeah.  But we're here.  You know, we can tell you that everything's okay. 
[03:32:30]  Don't worry.  You're fine.  Don't get nervous.  You all right?  No.  I think.  I think.  You think?  Yeah.  Are you feeling itchy at all?  I was itching a little bit.  Yeah, she's itching her.  I'm not doing...  You're scratching your knee.  Don't itch.  Don't itch.  People have itched right through their own skin.  Now you're scratching your wrist.  No, I'm not.  You just did. 
[03:33:00]  I just scratched your arm.  You're starting to feel itchy.  Patty.  Patty.  Please be honest with you.  Are you honest with us?  Are you feeling itchy?  You have to be honest.  You have to be honest.  Be honest.  Look, you're scratching your face.  Oh, Patty.  All right.  Just get through this.  Get through this.  Don't itch yourself.  Don't scratch.  Scratching is the only real danger.  You're scratching your knee.  Stop scratching your knee.  No, it itches, but don't scratch the itch.  You can't scratch...  I'll just sit on my hands so I can't scratch. 
[03:33:30]  Don't scratch the itch.  Now, what about the fun part?  Are you having fun right now?  This is fun, right?  Don't scratch.  Do you want to get naked?  Don't scratch.  You sure?  I've already danced around the pole.  Hey, you didn't.  And I didn't know you had those other people in the room when I was dancing around the pole.  Why are you breathing so funny?  She's the greatest comedy speech pattern of all time.  Natural comedy character speech pattern.  It's fucking genius.  Why are you tapping your leg?  Yeah, what's the matter?  You're tapping your toe.  You're trying to scratch.  Stop scratching the itch. 
[03:34:00]  Let the itch just itch.  Itches have to itch.  Patty, how long do you think you've been sitting there?  There's bugs on you.  In this room.  How long do you think you've been in this room?  I don't know.  About a half hour.  That's hilarious.  Are you insane?  That is hilarious.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Patty, has it even been 10 minutes?  No.  You've been here about almost six minutes.  Oh, my God.  Look at her scratching herself.  That is crazy.  Stop scratching, Patty.  Stop scratching, Patty.  Look at her.  She's clawing at her legs. 
[03:34:30]  This is insane.  There's bugs all over you.  Are you okay?  I don't know.  Are you really itchy?  Scratch it.  Did you come with any of these people out there, by the way?  Why are you laughing, Patty?  I didn't come with the rabbit.  What rabbit?  Oh, my God.  Stop with the rabbit.  You just fucked up.  Stop scratching herself.  You are so fucked up.  You're itching.  There's a rabbit out there.  Is there a rabbit out there?  Yeah, rabbits are rampant, man.  This place is infested with rabbits.  They're all shrugging their shoulders and shaking their heads. 
[03:35:00]  No, Patty.  She's seeing rabbits?  Rabbits.  Patty, we're right here.  I've never seen anything like this before.  You're talking to me.  Patty, we're talking to you.  Oh, man.  You're fucked up.  You're fucking rabbits.  Who's waiting at you?  Renee?  The rabbit.  What are you fucking talking about?  Patty, stop.  There's no fucking rabbits.  What are you talking about?  Patty, stop itching the itch.  Stop scratching the itch.  Be honest.  Are you going to tear the skin up?  Oh.  You keep doing that.  Yeah, don't itch, Patty.  You're making the high worse.  I understand that you're itchy, but you've got to try not to itch.  And try not to think about sucking cock. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, don't think about sucking cock.  Do not think about sucking cock.  And don't itch.  Don't think about sloppy blowjobs, gagging bubbles of saliva while you gag on it.  You make that otter noise.  Joe, tell her.  Sloppy ball rubbing, just covered.  Balls covered in saliva.  Not fucking easy glide.  Joe, tell her.  Spit.  Tell her about the true thoughts that come out when you're on dope.  She should know that.  Oh, you're going to think about sucking cock for sure. 
[03:36:00]  That's why women invented it.  Are you thinking of sucking cock?  Are you interested in sucking cock?  What are you thinking of?  Listen, you're thinking of sucking cock for sure by now.  If you're, listen, it's been statistically proven that you start itching, you think about sucking cock.  You can't get away from science.  That's the way it is.  You're looking just really shaking for a cock.  They have peer-reviewed papers on this.  Your hand is shaking for a cock.  Just sloppy, sloppy dick-sucking finger in the asshole.  Just deep nose slamming him up against the belly because you're just fucking deep-throating that thing. 
[03:36:30]  Real man's cock.  Moaning and groaning to let him know every fucking step of the way you're enjoying it too.  You love that big fucking hard rod in your mouth.  It's the best.  What are you thinking of right now, Patty?  Come on.  You've got to be thinking about that, right?  No.  What?  Oh, Jesus.  Best answer ever.  Patty, you want another one?  No.  You know, sometimes they say another one will bring you back to sober.  Look around your surroundings there. 
[03:37:00]  I don't think so.  Well, that's what they say.  It works different than any other drug.  If you take a second one, it'll cure it.  Patty, get acclimated with your surroundings.  What's the matter?  With the rabbit again, Patty?  Patty, what's the matter?  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  She's got a case of the giggles.  Why are you covering your face?  Patty, you okay?  Why are you covering your face and giggling and moving away from Ari?  His pants are opened.  What?  What are you talking about?  His pants are open.  Who, the rabbit again?  No, the cock. 
[03:37:30]  The cock.  The cock.  The cock.  See?  She can't stop talking about the cock.  I told you.  I didn't talk about it.  Did I say that?  You said the cock.  You said the cock.  Because you've been thinking about it.  You're going to be talking like a dirty whore for the next five hours.  What are you talking about the cock for all of a sudden?  I hope you've got nowhere to go.  Oh, look at her staring at his dick.  What are you doing?  Wow.  Look at her.  She's staring at his fucking jump.  What do you want me to take it out?  You want me to take it out?  Patty, explain what's going on. 
[03:38:00]  What seems to be the problem?  Patty, what are you doing?  Patty, explain what's going on.  Do you know how crazy it is?  You're looking over at that guy's dick and you're staring at Ari Shaffir's dick.  That's a comedian.  He's not a piece of meat.  Patty, what are you looking at?  We don't see what you're looking at.  Why are you staring?  What are you looking at?  His pants are zipped up.  What's the problem?  Yeah.  Oh, this is insane.  She's gone insane.  Do you want to see his dick?  No.  I see it.  It's there.  You want to see his dick? 
[03:38:30]  It's already there.  I'm already seeing it.  Seeing what, Patty?  We don't see any.  What are you seeing?  Patty, I'm looking right where you are.  We definitely should have gave her a half one.  You want to see his dick?  Yeah.  What's the matter with you?  She's starting to see cocks.  Is it real?  Look at that.  She's staring at his dick.  She's staring.  Oh, my God.  Is it real?  Patty, tell us what you see.  Tell us what you see.  I think it's real.  Tell us what you see.  He's diddling.  No, he's not.  His pants are zipped.  There's nothing there. 
[03:39:00]  He's jacking.  Is that what you see?  That's really what you see?  That is a hell of a trip, man.  Patty, come on.  Look at it again.  Look at it again.  Are you sure?  Look at it again.  Are you sure?  Patty, what do you see right now?  Oh, my God.  Patty, what do you see right now?  What do you see, Patty?  Explain to us.  Patty, it's radio.  Do we know for sure he doesn't have his pants on?  He put it away.  He put it away.  Patty, what do you see right now?  He's not doing anything.  He is sitting there, and you moved rudely away from him. 
[03:39:30]  His pants are as wide open as the door.  Why did you move rudely away from him?  His fly is not open.  Do you see his fly open?  His fly is not open.  Not at all.  Patty, you're seeing things.  Yeah, Patty's looking like she sees a ghost or something.  It's amazing.  Patty, what are you looking at?  Patty.  A guy with a mask and a straight duck.  Right, and is it a rabbit again, Patty?  Stop fucking around.  No, it's not a rabbit.  Stop fucking around.  No, I think she really sees this shit, dude.  No, she doesn't.  She couldn't.  It's not a rabbit.  It's not real, Patty.  Look at her staring off in his face.  She won't stop just staring.  Oh, wait, are you still watching Ari play with himself? 
[03:40:00]  Is that what you're watching?  The guy's sitting there next to you doing nothing.  No, he's not.  He hasn't been the whole time.  You're full of shit.  Yes, he did.  No, he's not.  We're all looking.  I saw it.  He didn't.  What'd you see?  We told you you would see cock.  He had his cock.  Oh, man.  Are you supposed to say things that you don't normally say?  Yes.  That's it.  It's just going to come flying.  You start getting a really dirty mouth.  The worst words are going to come next.  What were you seeing, Patty?  Honestly, what were you seeing? 
[03:40:30]  Tell us.  What were you seeing?  A cock.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  Cock-a-doodle-doo.  You know it's going to ask, see?  Patty, you're going to want to suck that cock soon.  That's what happens with this drug.  You want to kiss it like a big turtle.  That's what happens with this drug.  It's okay to want to kiss it.  It's just a thing.  This drug makes you want to get the cock.  It makes you feel really connected to a man when you have his penis in your mouth. 
[03:41:00]  You just kiss it.  Patty, you're starting to itch a lot more.  No, I'm not.  You can itch as long as you don't, you know, itch too hard, okay?  We'll let you itch a little bit.  We'll make sure you don't itch too hard.  Don't scratch your hair because that's the...  No, no, no, no, no, stop itching your forehead.  Not up by the head.  That's because that's by the brain, and that means that the drug is too intense, and you  start scratching, and it's only going to hurt your skin.  I'm scratching my brain?  No, your head around your brain.  Stop because it's all the little things firing.  Stop.  Are you getting tired or...  No, now I'm wide awake. 
[03:41:30]  All right, now look around and tell us what you see.  No rabbits.  No rabbits.  No nothing.  No cock.  No rabbit.  Everything okay?  Anything weird?  Anything different in the room?  Different in the room?  Patty, will you at least sit next to Ari?  Because he wants...  The bottom line is he's sitting there to comfort you because you're really high, and you should  have somebody who knows next to you.  Yeah, Ari is actually a substance abuse counselor that we brought in just in case anything goes  wrong with this little experiment. 
[03:42:00]  Just making sure you're okay.  My God, she's just staring at his cock.  Look at her hands shaking.  Look at her hands shaking.  Why is your hands shaking?  What are you looking at?  Look at her hand hoping the microphone.  It's like uncontrollably shaking.  It looks like you're holding a black cock.  That was shaking too.  Look, her hand is shaking.  That's great.  Patty, what were you looking at before?  Don't lie.  Look at her hands shaking.  What are you looking at?  Look, look.  There's no cock there, Patty.  I know there isn't.  All right, there's no cock.  I'm looking at a rabbit.  Stop with the rabbit.  What were you looking at? 
[03:42:30]  I'm wearing a bed with polka dots on it.  Patty, do you think it's real?  Do you think the rabbit's real?  Probably.  Patty.  Patty.  Now, Patty, let's just use logic.  Why would a rabbit be on the 14th floor of an office building?  An office building.  An office building.  This is XM.  We understand that.  That's not what he said.  So why would it be in the studio?  Answer the question.  Well, because he is. 
[03:43:00]  Patty.  But this is an office building.  This is a regular building in Manhattan.  Don't you realize you're high, Patty?  You're pointing at a window and it's annoying me.  Patty, focus on it.  Stop looking around.  Patty, you're not hearing any echoes or any of that stuff anymore, right?  No, she's okay.  All right, good.  So, Patty, why were you staring at his jeans before?  Because I thought I saw something.  What?  What?  Well, I saw something.  What, Patty?  What did you see?  A thing.  What?  You're scratching again. 
[03:43:30]  Stop scratching.  I'm not scratching.  What did you see?  No, you are scratching.  We're here to make sure everything goes okay for you.  What did you see?  I saw his pee-pee.

You've never said in one day, ever?  Do you normally have a mouth like that?  No.  No.  I'm a lady.  Oh, boy.  You sure don't sound like that.  You're a very high lady right now. 
[03:44:00]  You're scratching a lot now, Patty.  You're scratching a lot.  The scratching feels good, right, Patty?  It's a little handshake, too.  I don't know.  Oh, my handshake.  I don't know.  My handshake.  That's incredible.  What's going on, Patty?  He's tickling me.  He's not tickling you.  He's not tickling you, Patty.  Oh, my God.  You're so high.  Oh, she's got the giggles.  That must be so strange. 
[03:44:30]  This is for the very first time in your life, and you're seeing things that aren't there.  Yeah.  You're hallucinating.  This is called, yeah.  You're at the rap.  It's rocking in the chair.  Of course he is.  That's Keith the cop, and he's not rocking in the chair.  It's hallucinations.  Keith's right there in a chair.  That's not a rap.  He's there to make sure that you're okay.  Ari, Kevin, and Keith is who you're sitting next to.  Be cool, Patty.  You're hallucinating.  Just be cool.  Keith is a trained corrections officer.  Yes.  He's a peaceable officer of the peace.  He's here to help you and preserve the peace.  Patty, will you stop looking at the people outside? 
[03:45:00]  We're talking to you.  We're going to be fine.  Ari's there to talk to you.  I'm looking at the rabbit, the bunny.  You're not looking at a bunny.  The big bunny.  A big bunny.  Okay.  You want to sing a song or something?  Usually, uh...  What should I sing?  Can you dance?  Can you dance for us?  What song can you sing?  Can you stand up?  Yeah, stand up.  If we put on some white snake, can you dance for us?  Stand up.  Come on.  Walk over here.  Old school.  Why are you walking so slow, Patty?  I don't want to fall. 
[03:45:30]  You don't want to fall.  You're walking really, really slow.  I'm pointing the wrong way.  Patty, why are you taking so long to walk 10 feet?  That is so crazy.  Patty.  Is it hard to walk, Patty?  How does it feel to walk?  No, the seat.  Patty, how does it feel to walk?  How does it feel to walk?  Weird.  I've got to go to the bathroom, too.  Oh, yeah.  You probably should hold it.  Here comes the big shit.  You should probably hold it.  Just sit there and go.  Sit there.  We're going to play a song and have you sing.  Let it flow, Patty. 
[03:46:00]  It's okay.  All right?  Patty, just let it flow while you're sitting there.  It's a part of it.  It's okay.  All right?  Just let it flow.  What's wrong, Patty?  Patty, what's wrong?

[03:51:00]  You can't possibly see his cock in that picture, you can't even see his crotch  Patty, we're all guys in this room, no one is taking that cocks out with a bunch of guys in the room  Except for yourself, no one wants to see  I don't have one  I know that, that's why you keep seeing them  You need to talk, someone's got to talk to her  Yeah  I tell you, in 15 years in the police, I've never seen anyone trip this so fast, it's amazing  So fast, so fast and so, just has no idea what's going on  Patty, what are you feeling right now? 
[03:51:30]  No, just you in general, what are you feeling?  A little weirded out  In what way? Explain for the listeners out there  Nervous  No one is turning off their radios, they're really interested in hearing you trip for the first time  Look at her scratchers off  You're scratching  I'm not scratching  You're itching your leg and that's the bad part, stop, let it go, let it go  I don't know, I'm doing that  It's okay to itch  It's okay to itch  Are you getting tired or feel like you need to eat or go to the bathroom?  I have to go to the bathroom  Just let it go, you don't have to even get up 
[03:52:00]  Why are you talking so slow?  I'm not talking slow  You sure?  Yeah, you kind of are  I'm not  Stop scratching  Do you want to take a nap?  No  Why don't you just let it go, Patty  If you have to go to the bathroom, just let it go right here, it won't go  Just relax, let it come out  It's okay  You want to just lay back and sleep for a little while?  No  Yeah, maybe you ought to sleep  No  If I find my way home afterwards, I'll take a nap then  Why are you scratching, Patty?  I'm not scratching  You're itching your leg  Oh, I'm sorry 
[03:52:30]  Yeah, that itching thing is very serious  If you're itching, you better tell us  Patty, do you have to go to the bathroom?  No  Let it go, just relax  Why don't we get Renee in here?  Renee, why don't we bring Patty to the bathroom and we can take a break  Renee, Renee will help you to the bathroom, Patty  Walk with the microphone  Walk  Yeah, go to the bathroom, Renee will help you  I think we should probably maybe calm her down, show her a real funny video  Okay  Oh, she can't walk with the microphone, can she?  Yeah, microphone  Well, why don't we get a cordless for her?  Oh, I see, we need a cordless? 
[03:53:00]  We can't  Wow  We can  We can't  Why?  I don't know how  Alright, why don't you walk  Can you take a cordless to the bathroom with her?  I don't know  Do you have to make a wedding?

He's a police officer, he sees this all the time 
[03:53:30]  Are you feeling happy?  So if he comes over to save you, it's because you got a problem  If he comes over to save you, it's because he sees something  Wait, she said, did I say what?  You say what?  I  What?  What did I say?  I don't know  Patty, you're talking about you wanna be with other women  Yeah, Patty  And you wanna, you just said  Patty  You wanted to do something and it was very rude  A few minutes ago you were talking about  We were asking about your fantasies and stuff  Cause Joe said your inhibitions go away  And you said you would like to be with a woman to try it out  I didn't say that 
[03:54:00]  We weren't just talking to you about that  You said before a guy you would wanna be with a woman first  Just said that  Right after you went on your cock tirade  Yeah  You said cock like 50 times in a row  Patty, your memory is shot now too  Do you remember saying cock?  You know you said cock a bunch of times, right?  I thought I saw it  You described it as pink  Yeah  Well you just kept talking about cock, cock, cock  Even before you said you saw it  You were saying the word cock, it was like crazy  I don't normally talk like that  Yeah, so what do you think that's about?

Can't even talk  I don't know  Wow  The drug brings something out that you really want  Rene, don't  Just make sure she doesn't fall down  Patty, why don't you go to the bathroom  We'll continue with you  I wanna see how you do in the bathroom  Yeah  Here, grab the wireless  We could uh...  We wanna...  How you feeling as you walk, Patty?  Slowly, Patty, slowly  Huh?  Fine  She is walking  She has only walked 10 feet so far  I felt so bad 
[03:55:00]  Halfway into that I started feeling really guilty  Oh, hysterical  I'm like, this is so wrong  Is that how you feel?  Is that how you feel?  Cause I gotta pee too  Oh my god, she is  It's like, what are we doing?  This is, we're playing a trick on a retard  That's so evil  Yeah, we're gonna take a break  And we're just trying to figure out if there's anything else  Show her two girls one cup  Has she seen that?  Oh, that would be awesome  And let's make believe it's  Oh, you gotta get that on the internet  Yeah, make believe it's like a Disney movie  No, I just wanted to get her out of here  So we can figure out if there's anything else we wanna do 
[03:55:30]  We gotta get that on the internet  Already with his dick out of his pants was beyond classic  That's hysterical  That guy is awesome  Yeah, his dick out of his pants on the ball  It looks like a basset hound  Yeah  You should, if you go to my website  You can see his troubled asshole  We couldn't talk about it on the earlier show  But we took this video of Ari taking a shit in the green room in Austin  And his asshole, he had like horrible hemorrhoids  His asshole looked like a Big Mac  It's fucking horrendous  I saw it  And it's on my website  And it's in infrared  It's in like night vision or whatever that is 
[03:56:00]  So it's green  It just looks so shocking  Fucking alien  Ari, is it popping out today?  It's probably normal today  We can show it  Would you show Patty?  Yeah  Well, it's not gonna shock her  Well, you know, he'll show her anything  But it's not gonna shock her like it would've if she saw it back then  His asshole has since  Okay, with the meat lips  Relaxed  Alright, we'll get into that next  Quick break  She's coming back  But you gotta see it  She's coming back right now?  Tired of pissed  Huh?  I gotta pee badly  I gotta pee also  Alright  His asshole's so disturbing, Opie 
[03:56:30]  You have to see it  Patty's making her way back in the studio  Patty  Here you go, Patty  Where have you been?  No, I didn't get there  What happened?  We got as far as the door  We couldn't find the disc  An hour  Patty  You've been on what?  An hour?  You've been gone for an hour  We just keep...  That's not on there  Oh my god  What Patty?  What time is it?  It's late  You were gone for a fucking hour  We saw you left  It's almost over  It's almost over  Ron and Fez are getting ready to start their show  What did you do?  Where have you been?  Well, I didn't... 
[03:57:00]  I got as far as the door  What?  What are you talking about?  Oh my god  What are you talking about?  You are just babbling now  You were talking to us  You were telling us you had to pee so bad  that you couldn't even sit still  Are you supposed to lose time?  Yes  It's part of it  If you're really fucked up  Yes, you gotta be really fucked up though  You have to know you were gone for an hour  Jesus Christ  We were so pissed off at you  Wait Patty, how long do you think you were gone?  Seriously, be honest  Five minutes  Oh my god  Keith, what's your expert opinion?  Yeah, I've seen people lose track of time 
[03:57:30]  but maybe five, ten minutes tops  I mean, an hour  That's crazy, right?  It's unbelievable  You really think you've only been gone five minutes?  Well, I thought  You thought, huh?  Yeah  This might be a problem  I told you, half a strip was fine  I know  She shouldn't have done a whole strip  You took a whole one  You took a whole one  You took a whole one  If a whole one might be hours  you never should have taken a whole one  Tomorrow  It can now be an all day  Why don't you just sit down and relax  Why don't we  You never should have taken a whole one 
[03:58:00]  Sit her down  Slowly sit  Slow  Slow  Slow  Slow  Slow  Slow  Slow  Slow  Slow  Slow  Slow  Slow  Slow  Slow  Slow  Slow  Slow  Slow  Slow  Slow  Slow  Slow  Half  Half  Half would've done the trick  Half would've done the trick

What moons?  What?  His moons.  What does that mean?  What are you talking about?  He's got his butt out. 
[03:59:00]  What?  Who has the butt out?  What do you see?  Tell us what you're seeing.  His pants are pulled down and his moons are out.  The rabbit?  Oh, Sam?  What are you talking about?  No.  But him.  I don't remember his name.  What are you talking about, Patty?  Patty, what are you screaming for?  You all right?  No way!  Patty!  Go away!  What are you screaming about?  Go away!  Wow.  My gosh, he's seeing things.  Wow.  Crazy.  What are you screaming about?  Your trip is getting a little weird, Patty. 
[03:59:30]  Patty, you're getting weird.  Crazy.  You're getting weird.  You're getting weird.  It went from fun to a little weird.  Go away!  We're not going anywhere.  It's our show.  Go them.  Who's them?  Who's them?  Who's him?  Who's him?  What do you want to go away?  The butt.  The butt?  The butt?  The butt.  The butt?  How weird must it be to be her right now?  The butt.  The butt.  What are you seeing, Patty?  What are you seeing, Patty?  I just see a pair of moons.  What's a pair of moons? 
[04:00:00]  What does that mean, Patty?  It's behind.  What are you talking?  You're just being weird.  Somebody on Paltalk just wrote shit on her.  Sometimes the simple things are the funniest.  The simple explanations are often the funniest.  Shit on her.  Patty, go to the bathroom.  We're going to take a break and we'll continue. 
[04:00:30]  Did we find the key?  I don't think so.  And let us know what you see between now and when we come back from break, okay?  Whoever said that line on Paltalk just capped off the bit.  Oh, I know.  That was hysterical.  All right.  Go ahead, Patty.  Shit on her.  I got a tinkle.  She's well within position.  It was the perfect thing to say.  Shit.  All right, Patty. 
[04:01:00]  That epitomized, that line epitomized the Opie and Anthony show in a fucking nutshell.  It doesn't matter what's juvenile.  It's just what's fucking funny.  Shit on her.  Just what's funny.  Patty is slowly but surely walking toward the studio door.  I've never seen anyone walk slower in my life.  Renee is holding her up as they walk past the bleachers toward the bathrobe.  She's about to fall over, too.  For the folks that are listening on radio that don't get to see this, Ari was bent over naked 
[04:01:30]  and had his naked butthole inches from her face.  And she was screaming like she was seeing aliens.  It was fucking awesome.  It was fucking awesome.  I mean, he literally had the crack of his asshole right inches from her face.  Before that, she poked his ball bag like five times.  We kept convincing her it wasn't real.  She actually called it.  She's got to really commit to touching it.  But she goes, make them go away.  Make them go away. 
[04:02:00]  If you haven't seen Ari's balls, they're like grapefruit and an old lady's pantyhose.  They're fucking huge.  You dick and ball.  It looks like a fighter pilot.  Show him your left ball.  He's got a crazy left ball.  It's very long.  It's on my website, too.  What is wrong with your ball?  JoeRogan.net.  It's a genetic thing.  Look at his left ball.  What do you mean it's a genetic?  It's fucking enormous.  Oh, God.  He's got one.  His left ball is like twice as big as his right ball.  Is that a tumor?  It's just lefty.  You've had to check out.  He's got a nickname for it.  How much cum do you produce?  A lot. 
[04:02:30]  All right, listen.  He's got a fuck with a glad bag on.  All right.  We've got to try to figure out what to do next.  We're going to take a quick break, wrap up with Patty and Joe Rogan, and call it a week.  Time to tinkle.  Opie and Anthony.  Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Every time I come here, I envy this.  I wish I could do this to you guys all the time.  It's so much fun.  Oh, hell yeah.  It gets to be a grind after a while.  Yeah, right. 
[04:03:00]  Trying to figure out shit every day.  Who are you kidding, Joe?  That's a good one.  Hey, Stalker Patty, you doing all right?  I see you itching a lot over there.  Yeah, you're rubbing your hands together.  Still.  You're all itching, man.  Itching a lot.  You want to just take a nap?  Why don't you just lay back?  Why don't you lay back?  Joe, will you tell her, trust me, laying back and taking a nap, nothing wrong is going to happen.  Just lay back.  You know, sometimes it's best to just go unconscious.  Yeah, just mellow out.  Just mellow out.  There you go.  Pop the chair up.  Yeah.  Yeah, pop the chair back and, you know, just let it happen. 
[04:03:30]  Just go to sleep.  Just relax.  Okay, go to sleep.  When you close your, most likely, as soon as you relax and close your, you're going  to go out and you're going to go to sleep so fast, you're not even going to know what  hit you.  Yeah.  Most likely.  But you'll be fine.  Can I wake up to a nightmare?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You won't wake up to a nightmare.  Nightmare is not.  We promise.  All right.  Although Fezzy is scary at times, so.  Hey.  Hey.  I heard that.  My awful Fezzy impression.  That was good.  You don't even have to mic, Rerock. 
[04:04:00]  We got Sam in studio to talk about the WWE.  Patty, seriously, just relax.  Trust Joe Rogan.  He does this shit for breakfast.  Yep.  Trust me.  You'll be fine.  That was my last one, too.  You pop a vitamin.  Joe freaking does all sorts of stuff.  I gave my last one to you.  You should be flattered.  Are you?  You should be.  She's asleep already.  She's sleeping.  She's getting there.  She's out.  Patty?  Wow, that's so crazy.  She's totally out.  She's out.  Patty?  Whoa, she is out.  She's getting there.  Holy shit.  Patty?  She's getting there. 
[04:04:30]  Patty.  Dude, she's fucking unconscious.  Patty.  She closed her eyes and she went to sleep for real.  All right, get her a blanket.  The folks at home, this is no bullshit.  Yeah.  She closed her eyes and she went out.  She is fucking out.  Completely asleep.  Patty.  This is crazy.  Get her a blanket.  She's snoring.  Patty?  That is amazing.  She's completely unconscious.  She's asleep.  She's asleep.  She's totally asleep.  Wow.  Yeah.  Could you imagine if there were other people that could do that to you? 
[04:05:00]  Oh my God.  Could you imagine if you could trick someone who's not that bright and obviously a little  fucked up into something like that?  Could you imagine if there was someone that was so fucking smart they could talk you into  that?  They could just fuck you up like that.  They could just fucking twist your brain up so bad.  You'd be like, I'm sleeping.  Alien.  We got that guy.  His name is George Bush.  Man.  Patty, grab the pillow.  Grab the pillow.  You got to trust us on this.  Just sleep.  All right?  Just sleep. 
[04:05:30]  It's comfortable enough.  He got scared when we put the blanket on him.  That's true.  Imagine if somebody could do that to you.  Sam, where are you?  We got to talk about the WWE.  I guess they got a big thing happening, huh?  Yes.  The Survivor Series is on Sunday.  Very cool.  The 21st annual Survivor Series.  Don't yell because we have some.  Is Eugene still in the WWE?  No.  Eugene just left.  What?  Why?  What the fuck?  Eugene was a special retarded wrestler.  Really?  Wait, they got rid of Eugene?  Yeah.  Why?  I don't know.  He wasn't working out.  What? 
[04:06:00]  Probably people got too pissed off behind the scenes.  Wow.  Horn Swaggle McMahon.  Maybe he got a little too crazy.  So what do we have to trust each other?  He wasn't really retarded.  Oh, really?  No, no.  He was just playing retarded.  He was just clapping.  I was thinking maybe he did like, that would be kind of cool.  If he could see if retarded strength is for real.  You know?  There's only one way to find out.  I mean, that shit's been around forever.  You know, they recently found out that there's a bunch of human synapses in your heart.  And that you actually can, like there's thought, there's something going on in your heart. 
[04:06:30]  They think it might be in control of emotions, like some crazy scientific discovery.  What if that is true?  That thinking with your heart, we've always thought like that.  Yeah, yeah.  Use your heart, follow your heart.  They're like, maybe there is a way your heart thinks.  And maybe retarded strength is real too.  And that's where it comes from.  We need to find out.  There's only one way to find out.  That's real.  You got to get a real retarded kid.  Really?  Next to our neighbor, yeah.  I would definitely say retarded strength.  Just based, and it might just be based on the fact that the lack of fear because of lack of, you know, knowledge.  It's like 28 days. 
[04:07:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You just have no idea.  It's all rage all the time.  It's just rage.  Anger and lack of fear.  Bleed on you.  Let's hear a big retarded.  Let's throw a retard blood on your face.  Let's get, uh, non-metarded.  Let's get Sam back to filming Patty.  But Sam, so the WWE Survivor Series.  Survivor Series is Sunday live on pay-per-view.  Yeah.  Uh, Hornswoggle McMahon, Vince McMahon's illegitimate leprechaun son, is, uh...  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  Fighting the Great Collie.  Hornswoggle McMahon.  You got to think that he smokes a little of the Iraqi tobacco. 
[04:07:30]  That Vince McMahon comes up with some shit, Joe.  That's hilarious.  He's basically a midget who dresses as a leprechaun, and he's fighting the Great Collie who's 7'6 and 420 pounds.  That's fucking awesome.  I would do a little angry Vince right now, but I have to sing tonight.  It's really amazing when you see what an empire that guy's built on just people, like, fake fighting.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  That's an empire.  Yeah.  No, it's not fake.  Okay, I'm sorry.  It's not fake.  It's not fake.  Performance, uh...  It's sports entertainment.  It's real.  It's all happening.  Those guys get hurt more than real fighters. 
[04:08:00]  Pal.  Those guys get hurt, man.  What else you got?  It's this Sunday live on pay-per-view at 8.  All the world titles are on the line.  ECW, WWE.  All of them?  All three of them.  I'm hearing that Vince might be on our show in the very near future.  Well, hopefully, yeah.  If this segment goes well, he will be.  So why don't you step it up a little bit there, Sam?  What about your belt?  Is that up for grabs?  No, that was...  I think WWE considers me a lifetime world champion.  Oh.  Because they give those belts to special.  Come on. 
[04:08:30]  Special radio.  On top.  But, yeah, the WWE title is on the line.  Yeah.  Shawn Michaels versus Randy Orton.  Mmm.  Shawn Michaels.  Obviously.  Yeah.  Hell in a Cell match.  Yeah.  With a world title.  Hell in a Cell match.  I like that.  Undertaker and Batista.  Undertaker still?  Yep.  Wow.  Wow.  Batista is the rubber match.  Jesus.  Undertaker still doing it?  He's been around for a while, right?  I remember him.  That's amazing.  Those guys.  Those guys.  That's much more dangerous than even real fighting.  Wasn't Undertaker buried alive ever? 
[04:09:00]  Yes, he was once buried alive.  But he's cool.  He's cool now.  He debuted at the 1990 Survivor Series.  You ever see that video online where Brock Lesnar does the flip and he lands on his fucking head?  At WrestleMania.  Is that?  Yeah.  What was it at?  21, I think.  Or 19, maybe.  Was that the craziest fucking thing ever?  I don't know.  He landed on his head.  300 pounds.  Yeah.  And he wouldn't break his neck either.  No, he's fine.  Yeah.  That's a gorilla.  That's a huge dude.  But yeah, there's a ton of matches going on. 
[04:09:30]  Another traditional Survivor Series tag.  Five on five.  Raw and SmackDown guys all coming together.  It's going to be an amazing pay-per-view.  Very cool.  Sounds pretty badass, dude.  It's going to be awesome.  Whatever happened to Jimmy Superfly Snooker?  Does anybody know where he is?  Yeah, we had him on our show.  You had him on?  Yeah, we did.  Jimmy Superfly Snooker.  We got some Jimmy Superfly for...  Hey, brother.  Do you want to hear something, Jimmy?  Hey, brother.  All right, so Sam, very cool.  When I was in high school, Jimmy Superfly Snooker was the shit.  We'd make that hand signal and dive up the fucking couch.  Well, he hit his head a few times. 
[04:10:00]  Superfly.  Oh, yeah.  Joe, he hit his head a few times.  Oh, you think?  Oh, you got to hear him.  We didn't get anything out of him.  He's on a tour now.  You have to play a game of them called Brains or Tapioca Pudding.  We have something about Superfly?  We're trying to find it real fast.  All those guys are crazy.  The Iron Sheik, he's crazy now.  Joe, listen to this.  Listen to this.  Okay, O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  This is the Superfly Jimmy Snooker, and you're listening to O.P. and Anthony. 
[04:10:30]  This is the Superfly Jimmy Snooker, and you're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  Superfly Jimmy Snooker on your radio dog.  On the radio dog.  The last word he gets in the football voice.  How about he's still a tough guy to knock out, man?  Oh, hell yeah.  That guy was huge.  He certainly was.  He was the best.  Did he ever win?  I don't think he ever won, right?  I wonder why they never gave him the title.  Yeah.  Maybe he was unclipped. 
[04:11:00]  Well, Bob Backlund was the champion back then.  Oh, Bob, what a goody two-shoes he was.  Yeah, that's why he was the champ.  He was the rusty star of wrestling.  Always did the right thing.  What a goody gumdrops.  Always had that, you know, like, stiff lower lip style, like, oh, let's go to work.  Yeah.  Well, Vince, I, uh, he always kept breathing.  Like, fuck it.  He was a real wrestler, though.  Yes, he was.  Supposedly he was, like, an accomplished amateur wrestler.  And where is he now?  Good point.  Exactly.  Where is he now?  All right, here's Iron Sheik audio.  Selling his logs.  I love this guy. 
[04:11:30]  Listen to this one.  This is Iron Sheik, World Wrestling Federation, three-time champion, All-American AAU champion.  Pleasure for me today, Anthony and Opion.  Bring me here to New York.  I say hello to all my wrestling fans.  And everybody knows I'm the real Middle Eastern man.  Come to the greatest wrestling country and most famous city in the world.  Manhattan, Madison Square Garden. 
[04:12:00]  I come three-time champion.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans, especially All-American and also my Iranian friend.  I love it.  I love it.  Pleasure for me to I come back here again one more time to I talk to the Opion and Anthony and pleasure for me always.  Pleasure for me, Opion.  Opion. 
[04:12:30]  That dude is awesome.  Anthony and Opion.  Chambwin.  Chambwin.  Chambwin.  Chambwin.  Greco-Roman wrestle.  Isn't it crazy that that guy's got a massive career just by being that fucking wacky?  Yeah.  You know, everybody wants a book.  I want to listen to him talk every time.  If I'm scanning through the dials on the radio and I hear the Iron Sheik talking anywhere, or if I'm watching TV and I see him on TV, I'm going to stop.  Yeah, absolutely.  I want to hear what that fucking crazy guy's got to say.  I hear what that nut is saying.  They don't get that.  They don't get that in corporate America, unfortunately.  That doesn't make sense. 
[04:13:00]  Look at the internet.  I know.  You would think with the internet.  I know.  You would think they would start waking up.  Right into shit-eating videos.  Thank you.  Go right into two girls, one cup.  100% of our itches.  All right, let's get Sam out of here.  So the big plug is.  Survivor Series this Sunday night at 8.  There you go.  Eastern.  All right, cool.  Pay-per-view.  I think it's time for line of the day.  Line of the day.  Why has Patty been sleeping the whole show in studio, by the way?  I have no idea.  What are you doing?  Patty.  Patty.  What are you doing?  Patty.  Were you hearing her snore?  Were you hearing her snore? 
[04:13:30]  Yeah.  Patty.  Why are you just sleeping in our studio?  Patty, what's up?  What?  You heard me.  Why are you just...  Get a mic on her, please.  Patty, all right?  Make me lay down.  What are you talking about?  Just a few minutes ago.  What?  What are you talking about?  You made me lay down a few minutes ago.  Yeah, right.  No, you came in here, God, I don't know, two and a half hours ago and said you were tired  and can I take a nap?  You sat on the chair and you fell asleep.  You've been sleeping.  And you've been snoring through the whole show.  There's audio of you snoring through the whole show.  Listen to the replay. 
[04:14:00]  You'll hear yourself sleeping.  It's crazy.  You all right?  Yeah.  I don't think so.  Well, you could fucking not sleep in the studio while we're on the air.  It's kind of a sign of disrespect.  You all enjoyed it, but you laid there for literally two and a half hours unconscious.  Patty, we ended up miking you because you were snoring.  I don't snore in my sleep.  Well, how would you know?  You did today.  I did?  Yes.  I do have asthma, but...  Well, there you go.  For two and a half hours, you were snoring.  Of course you do.  Why wouldn't you?  Fucking chihuahua. 
[04:14:30]  I would've got to stop the rest and not start spashing you.  You know you talk when you're asleep, right?  No.  Of course you do.  I do?  Do you understand this weird little shit you were mumbling while you were sleeping?  It was creepy.  Like what?  I don't know.  Something about rabbits or something?  You said you mumbled the word cock about eight times when you were sleeping.  Yeah, at least.  It was creepy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you...  Excuse me, but something's wrong here.  Yeah, you fell asleep in the studio.  You're supposed to... 
[04:15:00]  I snore through.  ...and talk or whatever, and you fall asleep.  Don't you remember I said...  I asked you...  You don't remember what happened?  I lifted this up.  I said, do you need money?  Yeah.  You remember that, right?  Yeah, I do.  And then you said, I'm not feeling too good.  I need to lay down for a while.  And that was two and a half hours ago.  We never got to do the bit with you, you know, trying to get some money.  On the hot seat.  We were going to put you on the hot seat.  It's a big hippity hop with a dildo on it.  Yeah.  You remember this, right?  I mean, I've seen hippity hops, but not one like that. 
[04:15:30]  But, Patty, you remember...  No, of course not.  Of course not.  You remember us talking about this, like you need money, right?  Yeah.  Then what happened in your brain?  Because then all of a sudden you decided to sleep.  Well, somebody must have helped me because I'm laying down and I have a blanket on me.  You don't remember pulling the chair up?  You don't remember lying back?  No, I wouldn't just make myself at home just like that.  What do you remember?  That would be rude.  How do you remember lying down?  What do you remember?  Yeah, what do you remember then? 
[04:16:00]  I remember you gave me a breath mint and then I felt weird.  A breath mint?  Yeah.  You need one.  What?  Your breath smells like coffee.  Good coffee breath.  You could have used a breath mint, but it wasn't that bad.  It was coffee.  What do you mean you felt weird?  Yeah, then you helped me to the bathroom and back and had me lay down.  What?  Why would we make you lay down?  And then I saw a rabbit come in.  I saw a monster sitting over there with a face. 
[04:16:30]  What are you talking?  You're just saying shit.  What is wrong with you?  What the fuck are you talking about?  I want to smoke with your smoke.  Patty, what are you talking about?  I saw a monster with a face.  You saw a monster and what did you see?  A rabbit.  A rabbit and a monster?  And what else?  What else?  I have the weirdest dreams.  What else is a crazy dream?  Yeah, I was like Alice.  Did you not get much sleep last night or something?  Did you catch up on your sleep?  Oh, I got enough sleep. 
[04:17:00]  Were you cramming last night?  You know.  Why did you just go out like that?  You just fell asleep and had a dream.  That's kind of weird, isn't it?  Didn't you give me something?  We would just give you something?  Are you crazy?  What do you mean give you something?  You know how illegal that is?  Yeah.  Why would we just give you something?  Give you what?  You gave me a breath strip.  And then what happened?  Then you said it was laced.  What?  Laced.  What are you talking about? 
[04:17:30]  Jesus Christ.  Oh, never mind.  Forget it.  What's the matter with you?  Do you guys think that Bond should go to jail?  Who?  I don't know if you go to jail, but I mean, it is a tainted record.  For sure, right?  You know, yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I had to lie about it.  The jail thing is a little weird.  But the jail thing is about perjury.  Yeah, that's right.  It's not about terrorism.  Clinton didn't go for perjury.  The president.  Well, you know what I'm saying, though.  He's also the white president.  This is on the cover of every fucking newspaper.  I know. 
[04:18:00]  It's like a big story.  There's a war going on.  That's what I think all the time.  It's like, there's a war going on that has been going on longer than we were in World War II.  It's so crazy.  It's like, what the fuck is that about?  It's probably the same.  Yeah.  It's completely insane.  Yeah.  It's like World War II was over.  Even like really, really, really.  Fucking Pearl Harbor II.  Dropping the bombs.  All the shit in between.  That's how fucking long we've been, you know, over there.  Even like really conservative, like pro-war people at this point are like, okay, seriously.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on.  You're fucking it up for the whole war image. 
[04:18:30]  You really got to do something.  And then I heard.  Yeah, we want to be able to do more wars.  More wars.  We love this war.  This is a bad war.  We've had enough.  Cancel this war so we can get a good war.  A good high-rated war.  I heard also that the money that they're trying to get out of Congress, of course, billions of dollars for the war effort.  Congress isn't passing it because they want some kind of date to pull out.  So what they have to do is reallocate money, which means bases here in the States will close.  They figured out how many they could close, take the money they would have used to keep those bases running, and ship it over there. 
[04:19:00]  And it's billions of dollars.  And it will last for two weeks.  Wow.  Billions of dollars only lasts a couple of weeks.  War is fucking expensive.  It is so fucking expensive to have a war.  And then I think when we weren't at war, how did we have any fucking money troubles in this country?  Because all that money was just here.  Laying around.  It was like laying around.  Billions upon billions. 
[04:19:30]  It was coming in every week.  They just printed out more money.  That's all.  It's an abstract number.  It is such an abstract number.  It doesn't really mean it's fucking credits.  How many credits do you watch?  When you hear about the United States currency as opposed to other world currencies like falling and falling and falling, it doesn't make any sense, right?  Because everything costs the same.  It still costs the same.  Gas costs a little more, but sneakers are the same.  Yeah.  You know, a cell phone is relatively the same.  But if I go to Canada to buy something, it's going to cost me more American dollars than it used to.  So it's just like, what is that for?  I don't care.  I'm not going to go to Canada. 
[04:20:00]  I'm not going there to buy shoes.  It's so abstract, the idea of like in comparison to what's worth more and who's more popular.  It's weird.  Yep.  We're ready for line of the day, Joe.  Oh, line of the day.  Patty, you all right?  Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine now.  You think you're okay?  You're a weirdo, Patty.  Thanks.  What was this monster?  It's nice that you can just come in and get so comfortable that you just lie down.  Forget the rabbit.  What?  Yeah, what monster with a face?  Forget the rabbit.  It's just the dreams that are going away now?  Yeah.  What other kind of dreams did you have? 
[04:20:30]  That's going to be weird.  Forget the monster and forget the rabbit.  She just had a vivid dream.  Okay.  Forget the monster rabbit.  What else did you dream about?  That's about it.  I have a dream.  Monsters and rabbits.  Not cocks.  And scary things.  Right.  Right.  Okay.  Line of the day is brought to you by BodogFantasy.net.  Free live scoring stats, bios, and news that will help you win big this season in fantasy  football.  All at BodogFantasy.net.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  You know what's the creepiest thing as a comic?  As soon as she starts, the first thing you want to do is make some sort of molestation 
[04:21:00]  joke.  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  She's talking about she's 13 when her dad died, and your brain goes, don't do it.  Just stop.  That's the first place I want to go.  Someone says two Jews walk to the bar.  Seems like just hours ago.  Yeah, that was awesome.  Big Kev.  Big Kev's geek stuff.  Tomorrow night.  Oh.  Yes, sir.  What can we expect?  Briefing?  Scheduled to appear, Sam Jones and Melody Anderson from the 1980 film Flash Gordon. 
[04:21:30]  Wow.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Stop it.  Yes.  That movie was fucking awesome at the time.  There was a lot of controversy when I was on the show about that movie and if it was better  than other movies, and so you're going to clear that up.  So we're going to settle that hash tomorrow.  All right.  Is it true you paid to have him flown in?  What's that?  Did you have him flown in?  I am having Sam flown in, yeah.  Didn't use his jetpack.  Are you paying for his flight?  Yeah, I paid for it.  Wow.  Wow.  What airline? 
[04:22:00]  I don't remember.  Coach or first?  First.  Holy shit.  Is this guy still an actor or is he a...  He does stuff still, yeah.  He does.  Stuff.  A lot of directing.  Wow.  How much was it?  The art house circuit?  I can't remember.  Big Kev's geek stuff.  We didn't realize how rich you were.  Well.  Now you know.  Now you know.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  UFO landed right out there.  Like, wow, yeah, they're probably from another planet.  Whatever.  It's not DMT. 
[04:22:30]  DMT is 100,000 times crazier than that.  It's like mushrooms times a million plus aliens.  Plus aliens.  That's what it's like.  Our friend Joe Rogan right there.  That wraps it up, too.  That, like, sums up what that is as much as you can.  With aliens.  And, of course, Joe's going to be at Caroline's with Ari.  Tonight.  It was great today.  12.30 a.m.  Friday night, 12.30 show.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-100.  Only doing one show.  So don't be a jizz bag and think you're going to show up tomorrow and fucking see it. 
[04:23:00]  It's tonight, you cunt faces.  Whoa.  That's how to get people to come out in droves.  That's the only way to drive the point home.  Pat, do you want to leave the studio or what?  Anything else you want to say?  No.  We were hoping to do that bit.  I don't know what happened to you.  You went to another place, but.  Could have made some cash.  Next time, we'll have you, you know, go on the hot seat for money.  I wish I could just fall asleep with everybody in the room yelling and screaming.  Be nice.  Oh, wait, I did.  I hear a fucking dog outside, and I can't go to sleep.  Why are you itching?  She's itching or something.  I fell asleep right here. 
[04:23:30]  Did you win?  No shit.  I did this.  I was fucking beat.  And I did this.  And the next thing I knew, I woke up.  There was soft music playing.  All the cameras from Pal Talk were on me.  And everyone was gone.  I just fucking nodded out in the middle of the show.  And fuck, I was gone.  Down for the count.  You know how you talked about Iron Sheik being on the radio?  No one turned off their radios.  And all they heard was...  They just heard this. 
[04:24:00]  I think it was about a half hour.  And when I woke up, I looked around like...  And it hit me like, oh, fuck.  Last thing I remember, I was doing the show, so I must have fallen asleep during it.  It was horrible.  I think Patty had one of those moments today, Patty.  The chair's too comfy.  You don't remember falling asleep, I guess.  You kind of did an anthem.  I remember you telling me to sit back and relax, so I did.  I closed my eyes.  And how long ago was that?  I don't know.  About a half hour ago.  You crazy fucking bitch. 
[04:24:30]  She's still laughing.  You've been asleep for like two hours.  More than that, almost.  I'd say 225, 235.  Fucking James Taylor was a pussy magnet in the 70s.  Isn't it crazy?  A pussy magnet.  Now he looks like Duval.  Yeah, now he's just like...  Looks like an old vicar.  Fire and rain, sports fans.  Fire and rain, handicapped.  That's a vicar.  It's an old vicar.  Oh, yeah.  God bless him.  He's looked the same for 25 years.  Yeah, but he went through like a portion of the 70s where he was just like fucking buried in pussy. 
[04:25:00]  There's fucking wimpy songs.  You've got a friend.  Sensitive.  That shit tuned right into that pussy muscle.  Yeah.  The vibration of the...  The oscillation of the pussy muscle.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Which is tuned right into the pussy.  Gush.  Gush.  He found the exact rhythm, the exact sensitivity.  It just...  It implies cunnilingus slowly and softly for hours at a time.  Just...  Like he'd just lick your pussy for days. 
[04:25:30]  With music.  Yeah.  With soft candles and massage.  Wasn't that song about just wanting to...  Just wanting to not sex?  Yeah, but that's not what he's saying.  Oh, obviously.  What the fuck?  Jesus, I don't know.  Don't you know?  When I beat up to it, I think of just friendship.  You say that to your girlfriends all the time.  Let's just be friends.  Let's just be friends.  Yeah, I just can't help it.  I'm around you.  My dick gets hard.  I mean, I don't want to...  I don't want this to get in between us.  I mean, we're friends.  There it is.  How about if I just jerk off in front of you?  What about that?  I don't know.  Listen, it's not even... 
[04:26:00]  It's just physical.  I just got to get it out.  Just let me get it out.  It's going to help our friendship.  Yes, it'll help our friendship if you rub my balls.  Fast forward.  Just rub my balls.  Fast forward.  Give me the big cock!  Give me the big cock!  That's usually...  Oh.  There it is.  Oh my God!  Oh my God!  Oh.  Oh, my God! 
[04:26:30]  Oh!  Fuck.  Shit, I can smell your cunt. 
[04:27:00]  Don't stop treating me like a whore.  You're a filthy whore!  Goddamn rich cunt!  I'm a rich cunt!  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah.  I fucking love it. 
[04:27:30]  You ever suck a guy's cock?  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you, show me with your mouth.  Show me with your mouth.  He's a fag!  You can get a doggy style, you can get a ling on your side.  Those are your only choices.  This is my house and I get the same.  Nobody plays a better crazy fucker than Harvey Keitel.  Oh, yeah.  He's the best.  He's the best at that.  Just being a dude who's completely off the fucking deep end.  He was even menacing. 
[04:28:00]  Even menacing.  I'm sorry!  He was menacing as Mr. Wolf.  Yeah, yeah.  I tried.  The guy who cleans up?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The Wolf would be coming directly.  I tried to do the right thing, but I'm weak!  I'm too fucking weak!  He's great, man.  He's a psycho.  He's a psycho.  That movie, Bad Lieutenant, what a fucking crazy movie. 
[04:28:30]  They're going to shut us off.  Ah, fuck!  I know we could go to 12 if we would have taken breaks today.  Can I give a quick plug before we go?  And now people are going to go, ah, those kids get out early!  I swear to fucking God, we have only a couple minutes left.  Tonight, tomorrow, I'm at the Comedy Connection in East Providence.  Please go, and I think Borgata, January 18th, 19th, theborgata.com.  Powerful Jimmy North sold out.  Powerful Jimmy North.  Flannery's this evening.  What?  At the 14th and 7th. 
[04:29:00]  Yeah, I'll be checking out Anthony's band.  Yeah.  Mr. Potato Head getting back together for a few tunes.  After Joe does his two youths.  If you guys want to go to the UFC, please let me know today.  Yeah, we will.  I'll see what I can do for you.  Hey, here's your line of the day.  BodogFantasy.net, thank you.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day. 
[04:29:30]  But it always gives me bad dreams.  It's related to DMT as well.  It's all thought to be a part of the whole chemical soup, 5-methoxy, DMT, NN-DMT, melatonin.  There's a bunch of different things that your brain produces when you're sleeping.  That is a natural thing, though, melatonin.  Yeah, totally.  Because melanin gives me nightmares.  Oops.  That's it.  Yeah, I was chomping at the bit for that one, Jimmy.  That's it until Monday.  Patty, sorry we couldn't get to you today.  Yeah, we'll go talk to you next week.  Oh, all right.  Here, Tony, there's a mic.  I'm sorry we didn't get to, you know, do anything with you today. 
[04:30:00]  All right.  I want to do the dumb walk.  Okay, good.  I think you did today.  By the way, on the Long Island Expressway, for you people in New York, if anyone sees  a Ferrari 430 coming up on you, get the fuck out of my way.  Wow.  I will be doing about 150.  For about a mile.  Out of my fucking way.  It'll open up for a mile.  I'm just going to open up like chaff, like the chaff on a fucking fighter.  It's just going to be PBA cards flying out the back.  I'm just saying the traffic will finally open up and you'll be able to do that for like 
[04:30:30]  a mile.  No, at this time it's pretty open, but people get the fuck out of my way.  That trek out there is so insane.  The traffic headed out to Long Island, that's the craziest traffic in human history.  It's the entire extent of the fucking Long Island.  The real problem is the fucking tolls.  The tolls are crazy.  That slows everything up.  Any tolls anywhere.  That's the one thing that California has over the East Coast.  Yes, freeways.

You paid for that bridge a million years ago, you cocksuckers.  Oh, fuck.  You know, I mean, they make money off those things now.  Yeah.  They just don't want to let it go.  It was initially, the way it was proposed, it was that the people would pay and that until  the bridge was paid off.  And then once the bridge was paid off, it'd be free.  Right.  That motherfucker never got free.  No, it's still pocketing.  Yeah, we got to wrap it up.  I don't even know if any of this is going to make it.  Okay.  Bye, bye, bye, bye.
