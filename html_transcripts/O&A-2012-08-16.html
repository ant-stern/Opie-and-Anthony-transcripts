<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Sam Roberts filling in for Opie, who was hospitalized due to a four-inch scrotal growth, a condition the hosts described in graphic detail.  They then previewed upcoming guests Amy Schumer and Rob Corddry, commenting on Schumer's comedic style with vulgar language.  A significant portion was dedicated to a scathing, highly offensive review of TLC's "Here Comes Honey Boo Boo," filled with derogatory remarks about the family's appearance and hygiene. The hosts speculated on the family's motivations for appearing on television.

The show transitioned to a discussion of Martin Scorsese's *Raging Bull*, praising its cinematography and De Niro's performance, comparing it to *Ordinary People*, and criticizing Academy Awards decisions regarding Scorsese. This segued into an equally offensive and detailed review of *Rockstar*, complete with vulgar commentary on clips from the film.  Anthony then shared embarrassing personal anecdotes, including attending a Jackson Browne concert and dancing to the Grateful Dead for a girl, recounted with self-deprecating humor and offensive language.  Ani DiFranco and Lilith Fair were also discussed, using offensive terms.

A later segment began with an account of an animal charity event attended by a host, featuring anecdotes about mistreated animals and a Patrice O'Neal joke about a sick kitten.  The discussion moved to the event's musical lineup (Sheryl Crow, Indigo Girls, Queen Latifah, Lisa Loeb – with jokes about Loeb's glasses), then to other performers (Sandra Bernhard, Christina Aguilera, Nelly Furtado, Liz Phair, Sinead Lohan), and Brie Sharp's song about David Duchovny.  This led to a discussion of awkward dance experiences, including a Comic-Con encounter.

A phone call with "Bobo," whose social media accounts were hacked due to repeatedly giving passwords to people he believed were women, dominated a large portion.  Bobo’s mother joined the call, increasing the chaotic and explicit nature of the conversation.  The hosts and Bobo's friends offered advice and humorous commentary, filled with crude jokes.  A discussion of Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton's use of "black speak," featuring racial slurs and highly critical commentary, followed.  The segment concluded with further analysis of Bobo's situation and sexually explicit suggestions for helping him.

Amy Schumer appeared as a guest, engaging in a conversation about the recent Comedy Central roast, focusing on Carrie Fisher's reaction and Gilbert Gottfried's roasting of Roseanne Barr.  Schumer detailed her own roast experiences, including "The Burn."  The conversation touched on political commentary (Obama, Romney, Biden's speeches), Schumer's dating life, the original "Real World," and Disney World, all with frequent profanity and sexually explicit jokes.  Audio clips of a comedian's performance and Dave Mustaine discussing conspiracy theories were played.

The show continued with reminiscences about the 1964 World's Fair and a Disneyland submarine ride, transitioning to Amy Schumer's arrival in the studio, and one host’s attempt to hide an erection.  The hosts discussed their recent radio appearance as stereotypical shock jocks and the negative reactions it received. A lengthy and explicit discussion on anal sex ensued, involving Amy Schumer and later guest Rob Corddry, who also plugged his and Schumer's upcoming projects.  The segment concluded with discussions of gum, handshakes, airline experiences, and a casino altercation.

A segment focused on the perceived calm of pilots in crisis situations and sexually explicit conversations about the hosts' relationships with female comedians.  The conversation detailed sexual experiences and preferences.  Amy LaMotta, a guest discussing her Comedy Central special and Hartford Funny Bone performance, joined the hosts for banter about her boxing training. Rob Corddry, also a guest, briefly participated before leaving, mentioning *Children's Hospital* and *Raw Dog*.  Other comedians and actors were mentioned (James Adomian, Keith Robinson, Emil Griffin, Henry Winkler, Madonna – although one host deliberately avoided mentioning Madonna's guest appearance). Listener calls continued the show’s themes.

The final segment began with a Steven Singer Jewelers advertisement.  Listener-submitted ideas, including a fart-detection system for E-Rock, were discussed.  This led to critiques of a previous lion-roar/angry-panda sound effect and debate about the necessity of the fart-detection system.  The show concluded with thanks to producers and promotion of social media and upcoming shows, including Ron and Fez, with Troy tasked with working on the E-Rock fart alarm.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, yo, what's up out there?  Nice to meet you.  How can I sit?  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  If you're trying to find this offensive, just don't listen.  But my guess is you'll be sticking around.  Let's do this.  It's going down jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the O.P. Anthony Show  right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:00:30]  This is good radio right here.  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular radio shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the O.P. Anthony Show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome O.P.  The show is twisted, I'm telling you.  We're enjoying this shit.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony.  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Just remember that. 
[00:01:00]  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, he would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Not enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  My woman from Tokyo.  Hi, everyone.  It's the O.P. and Anthony program.  I like to sing program.  With the lovely and talented Jim Norton.  Yay!  Of course, Sam Roberts will be joining us at the board.  And boy, do you put the board in board. 
[00:02:00]  Why start on that note?  I'm kidding, of course.  Yes.  Yes.  O.P. still, Sam Roberts in for the vacationing O.P.  Wow.  I don't know.  Where is O.P.?  Anyone have a clue?  I don't know, actually.  Yeah?  Did he get the skin tag removed from his ball sack?  Well, he had been hospitalized because he had a growth on his scrotum, and it was rubbing  against his leg and causing a heated friction.  Oh, man.  A scrotal growth.  A scrotal growth.  Oh. 
[00:02:30]  It was about four inches long.  Oh.  And a skin-taggy texture.  Damn.  Four inches.  Yeah.  Skin-taggy texture.  Yeah, it was a long scrotum growth.  It was like an elephant's trunk that was sealed at the tip.  Closer to shaft or taint.  It was off to the right side, I believe, and it would rub against his right thigh when he  would do jumping jacks, because he's known for jumping jacks.  Is he?  Yes.  In all these years.  In his personal life.  I miss that.  There's a lot of jumping jacks.  Well, regardless, or irregardless, as some people say. 
[00:03:00]  Yes.  I've heard, irregardless of the situation, he's out.  And the lovely Amy Schumer coming in a little later.  Right?  Yes.  She's got a special coming up.  Yeah, her new special comes out on this Saturday on Comedy Central.  Amy Schumer's going to be a big star.  I'm really glad I was nice to her.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah.  Well, she'll forget all of us anyway.  Of course she will, but at least she won't hurt me.  She'll forget me, but she won't go out of her way to fuck me over.  Don't fuck me, Amy. 
[00:03:30]  I told you a long time ago not to fuck me.  Don't fuck me, Amy.  And you can see her this weekend at the Hartford Funny Month.  Yeah, she's one of those ones that's going to go through the fucking...  I know.  She's really twisted.  Amy's not like a fake hot chick trying to be naughty.  No.  She's really a bit of a fucking sociopath.  Yeah, she really is.  That's why it works so well for her on stage.  She likes having a good time.  I like that girl.  I like that in a girl.  She's very funny.  Know what else I like in a girl?  Come on. 
[00:04:00]  You.  What?  I don't know.  C4.  AIDS.  Oh, Ant.  Me too.  Me too.  Come on now.  Oh, and Rob Cordroy is here.  Rob Corddry.  Is that how you say it?  Oh, Corddry.  Yeah, Corddry.  I said it all.  Rob Cordroy.  I'm dumb.  At 9.30.  It's like Rob Denim.  No, it's a different thing.  Material is not a person's last name.  You should never confuse those things.  I hate that chip.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  I don't know if Rob and I have ever worked together.  I know the name.  I might have met him.  Yeah, he's another one of those whole guys from The Daily Show that kind of got pretty  famous.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Daily Show all of a sudden became this thing that just launched people's careers  in movies and whatnot.  Well, Steve Carell.  Except Mo Rocca.  Mo Rocca could not pull off the big fucking 40-year-old virgin thing.  What's he doing?  I mean, I know his name.  Yeah, I mean.  Steve Carell kind of flopped after he left The Daily Show. 
[00:05:00]  But, um, I'm kidding.  Obviously.  Didn't he?  So did, uh, yeah, Colbert didn't do well.  No.  Louis Black.  Oh, Louis Black is just terrible.  That fucking Daily Show really is a launching pad for successful acts.  Right?  Wow.  Yeah.  Except for the guy who hosted before Jon Stewart.  What's Craig Kilburn?  Craig Kilburn.  But he had a show on, uh, he had a legit talk show.  Had.  That's the, uh, the big word right there. 
[00:05:30]  Had.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, what the hell was going on last night?  I was, I was watching that fucking show.  And people want me to comment on it, but I don't really comment on it.  Uh, that, that Honey Boo Boo show.  It's some spinoff from that Toddler and Tierra pageant.  But it's, they had such a white trash family that I guess they decided to give them a show.  It, uh, I swear, watching that, I would love more black people to watch that show because  it has to make them feel the way I feel watching First 48. 
[00:06:00]  Like, like, this to me, white people, uh, black people would watch it and go, okay, see?  That's white people.  Right.  Just the white trashiest hillbilly motherfucker.  It was so disgusting.  Last night they had the mother who's just, I don't even know what she looks like.  She looks like she's melting.  And they were talking about her neck crust.  She's got those big rolls of fat and underneath them when she turns her head is that skin tag thing. 
[00:06:30]  That skin taggy brown shit.  What is it?  Let me see, Travis.  Look at her fucking face.  Aw, she's sweet though.  And she coupons.  She goes out couponing.  She's got a teen, a bunch of, a couple of teen daughters, one of which is pregnant right there.  They had a baby shower for her.  They own a little piggy that runs around the house shitting.  Where does she have the brown stuff?  Like under her?  Right under there.  Yeah, see?  It's on each side of the big fat roll on her neck. 
[00:07:00]  Under her neck?  Yes!  Oh my god.  Is she buying, like, bad food, fattening food?  She does couponing, so she's able to get, like, $150 worth of food for, like, $10 and shit.  She's hateable.  She is despisable.  And as a matter of fact, I think this is the part where they talk about her neck crust.  Because, uh, one of the daughters finds some kind of rust remover and comments that she  should use it on her neck crust.  This is, like, every show on TLC just combined into one show. 
[00:07:30]  Combined into one show!  It's the couponing and the hoarders with the neck crust and the honey boo-boo with the, uh,  T-tiles and tiaras.  Honey boo-boo's not even a cute kid.  No, no.  The kid is ugly.  Pumpkin's kind of cute, but she's, she could be fat, but she's not.  Pumpkin's 12.  No, I know, but I'm saying she's not like a, she's not, she's fell, she fell out of  the shopping cart.  Here comes honey boo-boo.  Yeah, yeah.  But it is amazing when you think of, if you want to look at what the, the abject failure  of what I've been doing, I'm doing Santa since 19, that's 22 years. 
[00:08:00]  22 years.  And that's a show.  That's a show.  I don't have one.  No.  That's a show.  We, we really have gotten to this point where they will put shit on television and, and  it will be a show that you never would have thought would have become a TV show.  And there's no reason for it.  If we can't make a radio show, TV show work with this show, with what we have going on,  we're dummies.  We literally should all be drummed out of show business.  Drummed out.  Adam Richman was in here yesterday promoting the Best Sandwich in America season finale. 
[00:08:30]  That's what he does.  That's his show.  Season finale of Best Sandwich in America.  So he travels the land looking for the best sandwich.  That's it.  That's the show.  That's the show.  And then in the season finale, he names.  That's what you do today.  That's a show.  He names the best sandwich there is.  Like, this is my favorite of the sandwiches.  Who gives a shit?  Oh my God. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, who gives a shit?  We should be able to do something with this very program.  We all have very different personal lives.  Oh, that's the...  God.  There's fat honey boo-boo.  They have habits that they have to break.  They fart and fucking blow their nose.  And there's the teen daughter, Chickadee.  Chickadee's in her third trimester.  Chickadee rules.  She's gotta be fucking 16.  They're all in there looking at her fucking sonogram. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, here's the beginning.  The mother likes to fart a lot.  There's honey boo-boo.  They are such trash hillbillies.  Yeah.  That I'm offended as a white person.  What's the father like?  The father is just a hick hillbilly.  Just walks around being...  Being a punching bag. 
[00:10:00]  Get on the dot.  Give me that fat cake.  Give me the fat cake.  Get off of me.  This is...  They're eating fat cake.  I think this is gonna be pretty.  And they need...  They need subtitles.  They need subtitles.  You can't even see what they're saying.  No!  Where are they from?  The girl's picking her nose in the background.  I think...  I love a good booger pick in the background.  Those judges play nuts.  After a lot of his pads are also wearing a chair up a little bit.  A lot of wearing a pad... 
[00:10:30]  She's 32 years old.  She's only 32?  32!  She looks like she's fucking 50.  Yeah.  Big fat slob.  Yeah, big one.  Look at the skin tags on her neck.  I hate that.  Oh, God.  You want to snip them with toenail clippers.  I want to take a fucking...  Like one of those things...  A file, like a hasp file.  One of those metal ones.  And just...  And just...  Scrape it off.  I don't even know what a hasp file is.  But I want to use one on her neck. 
[00:11:00]  It's a big metal file.  Yeah.  Where are they from?  I believe they're from...  They sound southern.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're from somewhere way the fuck down south.  I'm not sure exactly.  Georgia.  Georgia.  Macon, Georgia.  Are they from Georgia?  Yeah.  That makes sense.  So what, do they just film them until they do something bad enough that child services  has to come in?  That would be a good show.  Yeah.  That's a show.  That's the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They got a huge freight train that comes by the back of their house every day. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, my God.  What the hell?  It's six inches away from their house.  How did they get kids that are still alive when a giant train comes by their house every  day?  Probably only...  It probably started with a double the amount.  Oh, she's blowing her big fat nose into a washcloth, I believe, that she just took out of the  laundry.  Yeah.  This is one of those shows, though, that I'm infuriated watching, but I can't stop watching.  Hold on.  I'll tell you this.  They're not as stupid as you think.  No? 
[00:12:00]  No.  Because she knows that doing that stuff is herbili-ish.  She does.  Yeah.  And she's got herself on TV.  Yeah.  You know what?  I think you're right.  There is definitely some motive here.  It's not like, you know, some producer just saw that they're stupid and hick-like.  Yeah.  She's blowing her nose into a fucking washcloth.  If I fart and blow my nose and we spray the hose in the mud so the kids can have a slip  and slide on the front lawn.  But she probably doesn't realize how terrible it's going to be when the entire country hates  her guts. 
[00:12:30]  A lot of guts to hate.  Yeah.  Lots of them.  A lot of guts to hate.  She probably doesn't care.  No, probably not.  It's fame.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah.  Attention is attention.  Positive or negative.  Yeah.  I mean, these are just regular people.  They're not going to get...  It's not like they're going to get a bunch of TV show offers.  No.  No.  Yeah.  Here comes Honey Boo Boo is where it starts and starts.  And there's the dad.  Sugar Bear.  That's the dad's name?  Well, they call him Sugar Bear.  That's a cute one.  And they brought a little piggy home.  And I bet you the TV thing said, we'll buy a pig. 
[00:13:00]  Why don't you get a pig?  I know.  That's kind of...  I was thinking the same thing.  This is the pig laying one side of the paint...  One side of the paint...  This is the sounds pigs make when they're happy, I guess.  Yes.  Pigs hate being picked up.  They don't love it.  Not at a bar, though.  They love that part.  It's cute, though.  They are adorable.  The pig is going to feed in, as long as we show him love.  Give me a kiss.  They're very smart. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, boy.  Play with him, and they didn't get used to us.  Oh, he's loving it.  Look at her.  Elbows are like fucking skin taggy.  Anywhere her body bends, there's skin tags and brown crust.  Oh.  Would you share a bed with her?  Yeah.  No?  I wouldn't share a pizza with her.  It wouldn't get any.  She wouldn't allow it.  It's disgusting.  Yeah.  The little pigs.  They're so cute when they run to little feet.  They have toenail feet.  It's like...  They just tap, tap, tap on the floor like a velocity rocket. 
[00:14:00]  They can't run out on a little.  No, they can't.  All right.  Enough of these people.  But I was watching that last night and just disgusted.  Then I got fucking lucky and I got the copy of next week's Breaking Bad, which is really  good.  No spoilers.  Don't worry.  I don't do that.  I don't play that way.  I would love to, though, just to fuck Travis's whole enjoyment up.  But I watched that.  And then, goddamn Raging Bull. 
[00:14:30]  Can't fucking get enough of that.  I haven't seen that in a little while.  It's just so...  De Niro is so good in that.  Yeah.  Oh, is he an ass.  Yeah.  Just thinking his wife is fucking everybody.  The scene where he's asking the brother, you fuck my wife.  You fuck my wife.  I can't say anything with your big stomach in the way.  Yeah.  His big guts there.  He's eating a hoagie.  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking hero sandwich.  I'm going to kill someone.  Kill everyone.  Kill me.  What did you mean by that?  Why did you say kill me? 
[00:15:00]  What a psychopath.  What a great...  In that scene, what a great dummy look he has on his face.  See, even you don't know what you meant.  What you meant.  You realize there's no negotiating with this.  This is why he's the middleweight champ.  Yeah.  Because he's an idiot.  Yeah, he's just a fucking rockhead.  Yeah, you couldn't talk to him and reason with him that, you know,  no, everyone isn't fucking your wife.  And there's really no need to belt her in the face.  Well, Colin and I were talking about... 
[00:15:30]  I think in real life, the real story was that it wasn't his brother, Joey.  It was his friend or something.  And what happened was, in real life, he had come home and found...  Because if you haven't seen the movie, he's convinced that Vicky, his wife, fucked his  brother, Joey, and fucked the mobster, Salvi, who was played by Frank Vincent.  Frank Vincent, amazingly.  But in real life, I think he came home and found...  I want to say it was a matchstick or something in the ashtray, and Salvi always chewed a matchstick. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, shit.  So he came home and he found that in the ashtray, and he knew he was there.  So something really did happen.  Fuck my wife.  Yeah, and she's probably like, what are you talking about?  He came home with a coffee, you know?  One of those fucking Bronx-Ginzo arguments.  I'll tell you, one of the most uncomfortable dinner scenes ever, when he comes barging into  his brother's house, when the kids are eating, and the wife, and he just starts beating the  shit out of him, saying, you fucked my wife.  And because the greatest part is something about, right as they walk in, you hear Pesci's 
[00:16:30]  dinner conversation with his family.  Like, if you put your hand in there, I'm going to stab you at this fork, he's saying  to his kids.  That's his fun dinner conversation with the kid before his brother caves his face in.  Such a good fucking movie.  Yeah, and then at the end, where he's just up on that stage, reciting his bullshit.  And he's trying to get him to hug him in the parking garage.  Yeah, yeah.  Give me a hug, you bum.  Give me a hug.  Come on.  You hear the crinkle of the bread in the fucking...  Yeah.  Just the bread crinkling in the bag. 
[00:17:00]  Of course, yeah, Scorsese, fucking amazing.  And we talk about it a lot, about how he didn't win an Oscar for that.  What won instead...  Ordinary People and Redford for director and picture.  Yeah, that to me is...  If any film should have won for best picture and director out of all the Scorseses, I think  that was it.  I really think that would have been it.  It's better than Goodfellas.  It's better than any of them.  It's just a masterpiece.  That one color scene. 
[00:17:30]  Like, the choreography of the fighting with the fucking...  That music underplaying.  Oh, God, was that fucking...  Best montage scene ever.  The photo montage of his title defenses.  Oh, right, yeah, yeah.  It really is the fucking...  The bear trap sounds.  These bear traps.  For the cameras.  Yeah, yeah.  That scene when he wins.  Sounded amazing.  And the lights are going...  Yeah, the flash is going off and it's bear traps are the actual sound effect.  Like, that whole scene where he's fighting and he's like, you didn't get me down, Ray.  You didn't get me down.  That whole scene of the fight is amazing. 
[00:18:00]  Like, the way that shot with...  Yeah, Ray is there with the light behind him.  Slow motion, winding up that punch to just fucking bash him in the face.  Just looked great.  The blood dripping off the ring.  Yeah, yeah.  I like when the whole friggin...  The announcers and people in the audience just get slammed with blood and spit and sweat.  You've seen it, Sam?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's such a...  It's great.  I love it.  Yeah, we'll, you know, extol the virtues of other 30 and 40-year-old movies. 
[00:18:30]  Hey, you know what?  They talk about Citizen Kane and there was a lot of great things in Citizen Kane.  The camera work was brilliant.  It really was a lot.  Reggie Bull's a much better movie.  I know, yeah.  Than Citizen...  Some fucking rich douchebag looking for a sled?  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  Don't spoil it.  I know.  Don't spoil it.  Rosebud.  What did he mean?  I don't know.  I think he meant that his wife fucked Vicky.  I mean, his wife fucked Sally.  His wife was Vicky.  I'm tired.  It's a weird thing, though, because when those movies came out, like, Ordinary People was looked at as this great movie, but nobody talks about that movie anymore. 
[00:19:00]  No, no one does.  It's not quotable.  And everybody talks about Raging Bull.  It's not a quotable movie.  You know, no one's throwing out those Ordinary People quotes.  Even though it was, it was also a fun...  Ordinary People gets a bad rap because everybody looks at it like it stole the Oscar.  And, you know, it was Hollywood kind of...  They related to those characters.  That's right.  Yes.  But Mary Tyler Moore was great as this cunty ice queen.  Boy, coming off of everything she had done prior to that, it was a surprise to see her as such a cunt. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  That was good.  And then just the castrated husband.  Sutherland.  Sutherland was great in that, yeah.  Timothy Hutton won the Oscar for Best...  And Pesci didn't win the Oscar, although I think Hutton probably should have won for Best Supporting Actor.  That had more Oscar-worthiness, I think, than Pesci did, as far as what they would have...  What they deem Oscar-worthy, anyway.  Plus the emotional...  Timothy Hutton literally cried in every scene of that fucking movie. 
[00:20:00]  He did better than Alfred in Batman.  So should Alfred have won, yeah.  Bust the way, don't feel like I'll let you down!  Wait, Scorsese didn't win a Best Picture until, like, Departed, right?  Yeah, it was a gift.  Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Alright, it's long enough, let's give him one.  That's bullshit, though.  After all of his other movies.  He went for Goodfellas.  Come on.  He went for Best Picture for Goodfellas.  What year is that?  I want to say 92? 
[00:20:30]  Goodfellas, not 1990.  I think it is.  Yeah, it's like 90.  God, I thought it was 92.  I know, right?  Wow.  1990.  There's no way that The Departed is on par with the rest of his stuff.  No.  Like, it's a good movie.  It's a good movie, but it's not Goodfellas or Raging Bull.  But it's not better than Goodfellas or Raging Bull or Casino or any of those movies.  What year...  What won 1990?  Like, I loved Casino, too.  A lot of people didn't like it as much.  I loved Casino.  The lighting in that was great.  If you watch Casino, like, when they're sitting there at the fucking dining, and all of  a sudden there's, like, a bright light and it's shining... 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, yeah.  The weird lighting in that movie is great.  Dances with Wolves.  Oh, my God.  See, that should have won for cinematography.  Yeah.  But you're going to tell me that was a better movie than Goodfellas, Godfather Part 3.  Yeah, that I can't fucking see.  But that's another one that, like, when it came out, everybody was like, this is a great  movie.  And now nobody talks about Dancing with Wolves.  Nobody.  No.  It's another...  Hollywood loves an epic.  Yeah.  And that was...  That's what it is, yeah.  But Scorsese is the only guy who makes three-hour movies that you can actually just sit there 
[00:21:30]  and watch over and over again.  Over and over again.  Yeah.  Like, you can't do that with any other three-hour movies.  No!  Costner also won Best Director that year for Dancing with Wolves.  Yeah, well, of course.  That should have won, like...  Costner won Best Director over Scorsese.  Yeah, and that's another time an actor just beat out Scorsese.  Yeah.  That's another time a fucking beloved Hollywood actor beat out Scorsese.  Right, yeah.  But they're both seeing this terrible decision, especially Raging Bull.  Ten years, every decade, they had to fuck Morton Scorsese.  Terrible.  Yeah.  Yeah, and I mean, it's not like he sat there when he won the Oscar for Departed. 
[00:22:00]  He knew what it was.  It was like, thanks, but...  Yeah, yeah.  20 years, whatever, 30 years late.  You gotta know they're throwing you a bone at that point.  Yeah, thank you.  I don't want to sympathy, Oscar.  Great.  Well, they do these make-goods.  Like, they fucked Al Pacino terribly for, I think, Godfather 2.  He should have won.  Yeah!  They couldn't see me, but I was there!  Standing on my chair!  They didn't want to give it to me because the actual Oscar's taller than me! 
[00:22:30]  But they gave it to Art Carney, you know, because they're such sentimental douchebags in Hollywood.  They gave Harry and Tonto.  Oh, God!  And Dog Day Afternoon was great, but Nicholson fucking crushed everybody in 75.  Yeah.  That was a rough year.  Yep.  Yeah.  So we might watch a little of that.  Actually, probably from the middle, but those Scorsese movies, you could just pick them up from anywhere now. 
[00:23:00]  Anytime any of those movies are on.  You just literally just turn the fuck on.  You know what's great?  In the Raging Bull, there's a fight scene after they don't agree with the decision.  And there's a fight breaks out of the audience, and the way he films the chair being thrown from the audience.  You just look up, and the chair is flying through midair.  Thanks, Kenny.  It was just a...  Yeah, really great, man.  Are there any really bad movies that you will always watch when they're on TV?  Spaceballs?  That's hilarious. 
[00:23:30]  That will not go away.  You know, I was getting tweets, but it was all like, I'm so glad you guys talked about this.  I'm going to watch it again.  This is hilarious.  No!  I hate the fact that I actually helped it.  Exactly.  Blu-ray sales are through the roof.  Terrible.  Yeah, bad movies that I'll watch.  Like, I realized last night, and it was on commercial TV, too.  Oh, God.  But this movie, anytime it's on, I'll watch it from wherever it's at.  Hopefully from the beginning, because I liked Rockstar starring Marky Mark Wahlberg. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, no!  I don't...  You've got to watch it.  He's in a cover band or something.  Steel Dragon.  And he just loves this rock band and the singer, I guess.  Well, the singer's a gay guy, and they're kicking him out of the band.  Kicking him out.  And he's in the cover band, but he gets kicked out of the band.  And I want him to be the singer now in this band.  And he gets to be the singer.  Oh, horrible.  Is that a comedy or...?  No.  Oh, no. 
[00:24:30]  And it doesn't make any sense, because it came out like in the...  What year did it come out?  2001.  2001 it came out.  But it's about hair metal.  It's a hair band guy.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's like, in 2001 it couldn't have been less relevant.  It wasn't even nostalgic.  It was just...  No, not enough time had gone by for nostalgia.  And it looked like, why are they playing in front of a bunch of people?  Because no one would go see this.  Right, like, this isn't a good band.  It's old fucking hair band, Rock.  Is there any video from this?  Oh, 52%.  See if you can...  I've never heard of this movie.  Oh, it's terrible. 
[00:25:00]  This song is called Stand Up and Shout.  Is it?  Oh, yeah.  Wait, that's the big song from it?  Yeah.  Do you like the movie?  Yeah, because he gets up, like, the big scene is he's just a fan in the front row.  And he's singing along with the band.  And the lead singer notices him in the crowd.  And goes, hey, this kid knows all the words.  And he's singing.  He puts his hand down.  And he brings him up on stage.  And he grabs him up and goes, hey, baby!  And then they dance together.  Is that it?  That's Courtney Conklin.  That's Monkey Marks.  Oh, see, I thought...  He really can commit to a role, though. 
[00:25:30]  And he has a little of that Boogie Nights naivete in this.  Ah!  Is he doing a Funky Bunch thing?  No, Funky Bunch.  Does he have any Funky Bunch?  No.  It's like Spinal Tap.  It's all actors that I've seen, but they all have big, dumb, not real-looking wigs.  But it's not a comedy.  So it doesn't make sense.  Oh, man. 
[00:26:00]  Rockin'.  I'd be on this.  What is it doing?  He goes, Spinal!  Oh, no.  He's looking at the guy singing along.  Well, this, no spoilers, this is the end of the movie where he finds...  Because the rock star life is not for him.  So he doesn't want to do it.  And he finds a new rock star.  And he brings him up.  But the kid doesn't realize when he's just in the crowd.  And it's like the circle of life continues.  What is this, the ring?  If you go see this band, you become the singer?  That's right.  What nonsense.  This is so stupid. 
[00:26:30]  Do you know how many years I've wanted Ozzy to bring me on stage for Into the Void?  Oh, my God.  You just gotta learn to sing like him and look like him.  You'll do it.  Imagine Jim Norton all of a sudden the lead singer for fucking Black Sabbath.  How badly the critics would kill it.  That'd rock.  Oh, this is not fun.  Man, this is so bad.  Jennifer Aniston is his girlfriend in it.  Why wouldn't she be?  Ew.  From the beginning.  She was with him from the beginning.  But she doesn't like the way he gets swept up into the rock star lifestyle.  Well, of course not.  I want my old boyfriend back. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, man.  The guy who fucking cut lawns and fucking played in his garage.  Oh, the new rock star.  They just brought him up on stage.  That's it, huh?  The new, new rock star.  Why are they dressed the same?  Because this is a douchey movie.  Is that a coincidence?  No, he dressed like Marky Mark because he loves Marky Mark so much.  Oh, I got you.  Yeah.  This is embarrassing.  So did this pave way for Rockstar 2? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Electric Boogaloo.  Wow, this is embarrassing.  This is so bad.  Have neither of you seen this movie?  Look how gay they look for each other.  It's like two and a half hours long.  Holy shit.  It's great.  That's a Zach Wilde take off this guy.  He looks like Zach Wilde.  They're only 90s.  Yeah.  The sustain.  Listen to it.  You go back, have a bar.  You'll still be hearing that one.  But look at this.  My friends call me Thor.  I got to fuck up.  You know the rest of this little Thor?  Yeah, I know them all, dude.  I know everything.  I know all your moves. 
[00:28:00]  I've studied you, dude.  I love you.  What do you say?  You want to go over the roof off this place or what?  Oh.  Are you serious?  Oh, this is so bad.  This is the big moment.  Oh.  Hey, man, get out there.  Hey, man, get out there.  I would be so pissed if I went to see the band.  No, that's.  And then that guy goes out on stage and then Marky Mark leaves and now that guy's the new  new lead singer.  But the fuck is it?  They would throw something at him.  Imagine going to see a band and the singer leaves and just has some schlep from the audience 
[00:28:30]  come up.  No matter how much he sounded like the guy, you'd be so pissed.  And they do like whole montages where.  Because Marky Mark, obviously, that's the same thing happened to him in the beginning of  the movie.  Hey, that's the beginning of the movie.  And he becomes the rock star.  And he buys a Batmobile.  And they race for pink slips.  They race you for pinks.  And Jennifer Aniston has to deal with the fact that the girls, they go in the car.  They don't go on the bus.  But then she sees the groupies getting on the bus.  Hey. 
[00:29:00]  Is it true that in Greece, Travolta, he was racing for pink socks and then they changed  it for the movie?  Yes.  No, they were just racing for slips that they were wearing because he's fruity.  I'll bet you my girdle.  I'm going to race you for my girdle.  I was listening on my way and I had my little shuffle and one of the songs that came out was  Grease Lightning.  And it's just so funny when he's like, it's a real pussy wagon.  Oh, is it?  Is it?  That's just him in any car. 
[00:29:30]  There's a pussy in it.  Ah, that's fucking great.  Yeah, I was watching, I was flipping around the channels last night before I went to bed  and I was like, what?  Rockstar is on VH1 Classics?  Yes.  Oh, and the commercials.  And there's commercials.  That's a fucking language.  And I'll wait through the commercials to see the rest of Rockstar.  Ah, yeah, that's one that, well, if I hadn't just seen the ending, I might want to  see it.  No, you should check it out just because all the twists and turns.  And it slows down with, like, uplifting music at the end. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, that is really bad.  And the crowd is going for it?  Yeah, they love it.  There's nothing worse.  What a terrible interpretation of metal that is.  Yeah.  And it's just like, in the scene where Marky Mark is trying out for the band, the original  lead singer is yelling at the rest of the band members about them kicking him out.  And he's going, is it because I'm gay?  And Marky Mark goes, you're gay?  And then he takes off his wig.  And that's the first inclination of maybe all this rock music isn't all that it seems  on the stage.  Maybe it's not all real. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Right, right.  Oh, boy.  Marky Mark starts to see that there is some business in the show.  Ah.  You know what I mean?  Boy's eyes are opened.  That's right.  That's exactly right, Jim.  From fan to insider.  It's a tough ride, and that's the ride that is portrayed in this film.  Oh, boy.  Really up and down.  Yeah.  I kind of like him better in Boogie Nights when he's singing.  But in the beginning of it, he is like the guy in Boogie Nights because he's naive,  and he's like, yeah, man.  And he's doing the Boogie Nights voice.  Oh, boy.  Where he's in the club. 
[00:31:00]  As we're watching that last scene, I was thinking just to act it out.  If they told me, okay, now what you have to do is go like, yeah!  Oh, how embarrassed I would be to do, yeah!  I just wonder how actors pull off an embarrassing scene.  Like, how do you fucking get into it and make it look, like, good or try to, at least?  Don't judge the material, I guess.  Like, it's humiliating to do material that you think, for me, that I think isn't funny  or that I think is bad.  Like, how do I deliver this? 
[00:31:30]  Because I feel like Jim Norton's saying it, and you have to just get rid of that.  Oh, you're not.  You've got to take yourself out of it.  Like, I'm not Jim Norton embarrassing myself.  I'm fucking this guy.  It's really hard to do.  Oh, it's so hard to do.  And that's why great actors can do, like, shitty roles and survive them.  Ugh.  I think Marky Mark's a really good...  Mark Wahlberg is a really good actor.  Marky Mark.  Marky Mark.  I just called him the whole time.  Marky Mark.  It's terrible.  He is.  He's a great actor, but...  I was watching Footloose last night when it was on regular...  On CMT.  Footloose. 
[00:32:00]  The country music, whatever it is, is terrible.  Hey, is that McNulty?  No.  Nick Nulty?  No, McNulty from...  Oh, God, let's see.  The guy with the curly...  Dominic, uh...  The curly black hair.  Go back a little.  McNulty.  Whatever you want to hear.  He is.  I think that's fucking him, dude.  This movie's so bad.  It's the worst.  I think it's from The Wire.  Let's hear...  Is he British in real life?  Yes, that's him.  I think it's him.  Oh, my God.  He is.  I think it is him.  Oh, yeah.  That's hilarious.  I'm a rocker, because I'm John fucking Wayne.  No, wait. 
[00:32:30]  McNulty's the fucking guy.  Have you ever listened to the lyrics of stand-up?  This is the original...  That's hilarious.  Kim was a girl.  We shouldn't watch this, because we're not going to stop.  It's bad.  You know what?  We are like...  Dominic West.  Dominic West.  We will watch the whole movie here on the show.  It's so bad.  It's the greatest movie ever.  It is not, but...  I love it.  I think you're right.  It is.  Yeah.  And who's the other guy with the blonde long hair?  He's somebody else.  When you did show your attitude...  Oh, this is all we fucking need. 
[00:33:00]  You can't play the fucking guitar anymore.  It's your fucking wife.  Whoever the fuck she is.  Oh, Spinal Tap.  Sorry.  It's all the same to me.  I have a pertinent question.  We gonna do Stonehenge tonight?  No, we're not gonna fucking do Stonehenge.  And he's going on...  And by the way, and this is also a reflection of Marky Mark leaving the Steel Dragon cover band  that he was in, because they kicked him out.  And he was saying, you guys are nothing without me.  See?  It's the same thing. 
[00:33:30]  It's like the circle of life so many times in the movie.  Yeah, really.  Yeah, you're right.  But that's why I like it, because it's like you can learn some lessons and be entertained.  Jesus Christ.  Or you can do neither.  It's terrible.  But I was wondering, how did...  There's a scene in Footloose where he's not allowed to dance.  Yes, that's the whole fucking gist of the movie, yeah.  But he parks the car, and he's just running, and he's running and throwing his arms up  and dancing.  So you wonder how Kevin Bacon got the motivation to...  Yeah, like, I would be more proud to play the fucking gay guy in jail who's trying to 
[00:34:00]  suck Mr. Garrison's dick before he leaves.  You handsome man, Mr. Garrison.  Yeah, that is embarrassing.  How do you run and skip and jump on a car and dance?  And that was Chris Penn in that movie with him.  Was it?  Yes.  Chris Penn is all skinny and young, and there's a scene where he's teaching them to dance  in the car, and they're mouthing, one, two, three...  Don't dance with my dad!  Yeah!  You quit pointing that musical note at my daddy! 
[00:34:30]  Well, the whole premise of the movie, like, once the script...  When you think, like, what about this script made him take it?  Because the whole thing is just a town that's not allowed to dance.  Yeah.  And you come to bring dance to the town.  Now he's hitting the steering wheel.  He's so mad that he can't dance.  He wants to dance!  And he's like, why can't I dance?  He's just so mad!  I hate these movies where they make it seem like dancing is a badass thing.  Yeah.  Like, it's a cool thing to dance.  Like, I smoke cigarettes and drink beer and dance.  That's a bottle of Jack.  Oh, look, look, he's starting to just dance! 
[00:35:00]  He's just dancing angrily.  He's thinking of what makes him mad, and he's spinning and jumping.  I roll up my sleeves.  He wants to dance!  He's drinking, smoking, and now he's going to be a real badass and start dancing.  Yeah!  Break that bottle!  Now, just...  Fuck you!  There he goes!  Yeah!  Look, dude, look!  I'm all douchey about it!  He's dancing in front of the car.  With his stonewashed jeans and his white Reeboks.  Yeah.  But he's doing, like, an Elvis dance up against the car full of passion. 
[00:35:30]  Anybody who dances...  And now there he goes.  He's dancing again in the warehouse.  Look at him!  He's going!  Anybody who dances in a crewneck sweatshirt is not cool.  Now he's running.  How could he not be embarrassed to do this?  He's running.  What's he doing?  This is terrible.  Why would you do this?  I don't know.  Now he takes off his sweatshirt.  Now he's in his wife beater.  Oh, just dancing passionately in the warehouse.  This is terrible.  And this was an $80 million worldwide hit. 
[00:36:00]  What's he doing?  Oh, my God.  This is not a realistic look at fucking white urban youth.  I would never be so angry that I have to dance.  Me neither.  I'd be angry if I had to.  Yes!  I'd be uncomfortable just watching this in a theater.  Yeah, me too.  Let alone like...  All right, this is the big dance scene, Kevin.  Dude, this was a massive hit, too.  Holy shit.  How bad is this?  Yeah, but at least he probably just did it in one take, right?  Oh, no.  Oh, no, no.  I disagree, Fred.  Oh, could you only imagine how much dance in here to do? 
[00:36:30]  We need your jeans to be tighter.  And the girl who plays this chick, I read recently, she beat out Madonna for the role.  She's fucking beautiful.  She's like an ex-playman, I think, or ex-song.  The character has more dignity in The Woodsman.  He does play a good fucking dirtbag, too.  He is.  Yeah, if he's not trying to blow fucking Kevin Costner, he wants to molest some kid in the  fucking park.  You're right, that character didn't have more dignity.  Let's go birdwatching with the 12-year-olds.  Oh, look at him.  Oh, look at the montage of him jumping and spinning. 
[00:37:00]  There's a jumping montage.  Then again, all those guys who did Grease also had to feel like dickholes, doing like  Grease lightning and stuff like that.  Grease lightning, pretty dumb.  And then...  It is, but there's a weird thing about a musical, a pure musical like that, that's not as, plus  Travolta, but it's not as embarrassing for some reason as this, because it is what it  is.  It's because in Grease, there is a group, you know?  They're always dancing as a group. 
[00:37:30]  He's alone.  No.  He's alone.  In a warehouse with a crewneck sweatshirt on.  Dude, when he's fucking, he's drinking the jacket, he throws it, and he's just, the  dance comes out of him.  He can't stop it.  It doesn't even look like he wanted to dance.  He had to dance.  Yeah, the dance just burst through.  Is that what happens to people?  Like, is that why you got sober?  Because you used to drink a lot and then just start dancing.  I would just park in a warehouse and dance angrily.  They'd be like, where's Jimmy?  He's dancing again.  That's not allowed.  Not in this town.  No. 
[00:38:00]  I'm the sheriff here.  I say stop that.  I told you, I remember years ago being very drunk at a fucking, at a party, and I was  dancing a little bit like hip hop.  I was kind of partially in a blackout, but I remember even being embarrassed in that drunken  state.  Wow.  Embarrassment came through?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And who drinks Jack and then has choreography that's in time as well as that?  I know he's smoking, but he can still fucking do flips and run around.  John Lithgow was very good in this.  I mean, the acting was great, but, wow, terrible movie. 
[00:38:30]  You know, your little story there kind of reminded me of something.  Oh, boy.  I do remember, and again, it was, you know, trying to get laid or something.  Um, uh, uh, uh, there was a girl and, and she liked, like, the dead music.  I fucking hate the dead.  I hate it.  And, uh, it was playing in her dorm room, and, uh, I was in the dorm room, and she started,  like, dancing around, doing a little dead dance, and she wanted me to dance with her,  so I did. 
[00:39:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Ew.  Oh.  I didn't know anything I was doing.  I was so embarrassed.  Were you embarrassed?  I'm still embarrassed telling it.  Ew.  Jimmy, it was terrible.  You did a grateful dead dance in the dorm room, you fucking hippie.  I just kind of was trying to just, like, yeah.  Ew.  I was terrible.  That's the real Anthony.  Yeah.  Not this gun guy, fucking nerd in the dorm room, trying to fuck some chick with hairy  legs.  Oh, I hate it.  I hate that I did it. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, fucking bull.  I was so embarrassed.  How long did you do it?  For a long time.  Yeah.  Did you have to pretend like you had done it before?  One song is fucking 20 minutes long.  And you were acting like you had been there before, like, you knew the dead, you knew  how to dance to it, and this was your scene, too.  My scene.  And at some point, like, a minute in, you're probably thinking, I wonder how much longer  I have to do this.  All I was thinking is, when can I stop this?  I want to stop.  She said, yeah, come dance, and you're like, okay?  She's like, yeah, come on.  Yeah, because she got up, and she's, like, dancing around and shit, and I'm just kind 
[00:40:00]  of now sitting on the bed or something, just like, oh, why can't you just take your  clothes off?  Do you remember what dead song it was?  No, it was some fucking horrible, long, jammy-sounding piece of shit.  Oh, there we go.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to get up there.  Yeah, you want to groove, don't you?  Just want to get up there and dance?  Dance the night away, don't you, sissy?  It was terrible.  So I had to get in, and she goes, and she kind of went like, come on. 
[00:40:30]  Like, it was all fun and everything?  And you were like, yeah, this will be fun.  And it was a fucking decision crossroad for me right there.  I wanted to say, nah, but then, like, I'm just sitting there.  Yeah.  Why be a man and make a decision when you could do what she tells you?  Oh, I know.  So I just, I got it, and I just started, like, what I thought a dead dance should be.  Like what you would see on TV?  Just grooving around.  Yeah.  Were there people around?  I look like one of the older sister from Wonder Year's Friends. 
[00:41:00]  You probably look like the little, the fucking stupid puppet from Sixth Sense, the marionette.  Your arms are probably just fucking, ew.  Oh, believe me, I wanted some of Mom's soup after that one.  Some of her Lysol soup.  Oh, God, was that terrible?  Oh, and I love to see you dancing around a college dorm.  It was, it was terrible.  And you think she probably thought, like, wow, this guy can't do the dead dance.  That's just it.  I thought I'd blow up my spot by not being able to do it. 
[00:41:30]  And would that be worse than, than just not doing it?  That's pretty much what I was doing.  Was it just you and her?  I was just trying to move like, like a fucking rubber band guy.  Just like, like, you don't care, but you care.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, look, I looked up a lot.  At the ceiling?  But you were just letting yourself go.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The music was in you.  Let me tell you, that music didn't take me anywhere.  No, it wasn't the music movie.  It wasn't in me at all.  It was just me trying to, uh, trying to get a girl to like you. 
[00:42:00]  Yes.  Trying to get a girl to like me.  Get a girl to think you were cool.  Ugh!  Is that the girl along who started saying, could you call before you show up?  Yes!  She ended up being that girl.  Oh, no.  Yes.  Because there's some guy with a big swinging dick who was a really good dead dancer.  Oh, really good dead dancer.  And I sucked at it.  Oh, what an idiot.  Get up, dance with me.  I wish, right now, I could hop in a DeLorean, set that fucking date back, and drive to Camden, 
[00:42:30]  Connecticut, go to Quinnipiac College, and punch myself right in the fucking mouth.  You would do that?  That would be so great if I just kicked the door open in the dorm, and there I am, young,  big, afro-ed, fucking, acne-laden Anthony, trying to get a girl to like me by dancing.  And then I come in and just go, what the fuck are you doing?  And he goes, whoa.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, this really is your father reincarnated in you.  Oh, my God.  I would look at myself and just go, son of a bitch.  Hell, you trying to.  I got late, and I never had to dance like a faggot.  That's what Dad would tell me.  Oh, and I'd love to see that, your fucking Grateful Dead arms flailing.  Oh, it was bad.  Maybe our next live event.  Yeah, we should have Anthony.  Maybe, would you do a Grateful Dead dance in front of the audience?  No!  Like, I'll just move to the music?  No!  What if somebody was like, come on! 
[00:43:30]  Never!  I don't care who said, come on!  When he was like, girl!  You see his fucking pistol showing?  Yeah, that's sort of an opposite thing.  That and one other embarrassing thing I did for, well, I've done a few embarrassing things  for a girl, but.  That's terrible.  I went to a Jackson Brown concert for a girl and acted like I liked it.  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  That was terrible.  Back in that time when, you know, my friends would have been like, you know, why aren't you  Charlie Daniels or fucking Outlaws? 
[00:44:00]  What was the big song, Lawyers in Love?  That was even before that.  Won't you stay just a little bit longer?  It's not that bad.  Oh, it's terrible.  Yes, it is that bad.  You are such a fruit.  Yeah, like Travis, you're a gay guy, so it wouldn't be like, you don't understand.  I don't want to make Travis mad now because he's going to start dancing around if he gets angry.  No, I'm just saying going to a concert for a girl isn't, like, the worst thing I do.  I'll tell you what is bad, the fact that we're talking about Jackson Brown, why would  any be playing? 
[00:44:30]  Oh, it's true.  What's the matter?  What are you doing back then?  You just threw his arms up in the air.  What happened?  He was like, I was trying to work on my SummerSlam card.  What happened?  Throws hands up in the air, like, he's dancing.  Running on Empty.  That was it.  Running on Empty.  What song is this?  This is this one.  Oh, right.  But put on Running on Empty.  That's the one.  All right.  We know that one.  There it is.  This was his, like, big hit, too.  This is okay.  I mean, it's...  It was so faggy, though. 
[00:45:00]  If you were listening to...  It's a little faggy, but...  If you were listening to, like, you know, rock of the time...  There's a lot of worse things you can do than go to a concert for a girl.  All right.  You know?  Yeah, not as bad as Dancing Grateful Dead.  No, nothing you ever say will be.  Yeah, that was pretty bad.  You know who I used to have to listen to all the time for a girl and be like, yeah, this  is pretty good.  Ani DeFranco.  What?  Ani DeFranco.  Yeah?  Ani DeFranco?  Yeah, she's like a real fucking, like, radical chick singer. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  Veminist, hairy-pitted...  Oh, I hate those.  Lilith Fair.  Oh, I hate those.  I went to Lilith Fair for a girl.  Oh, you went to Lilith Fair?  Oh, okay.  That's pretty gay.  That's worse.  That's pretty gay.  That's why...  Oh, that's why Travis was over here being like, you know, you could do a lot worse things  than going to a concert.  You went to Lilith Fair?  Yeah, like, go to a fair.  Yeah.  What is Ani DeFranco?  A-N-I DeFranco.  I don't even know if I've ever heard her music.  Oh, really?  Really.  Yeah.  It's not masculine.  What's the song? 
[00:46:00]  I really...  I wouldn't know.  I guess 32 Flavors is probably your biggest...  Second.  That is pretty funny.  You went to Lilith Fair?  Yeah.  Did you like it?  Did you get a shirt?  No, I didn't get a shirt.  Remember how we were watching Rockstar a little earlier in the program?  Awesome.  And Jimmy was, like, talking about how that guy was ripping off Zach Wilde's, like, style.  No, I just thought that would really look like Zach.  Was it Zach Wilde?  It was Zach Wilde.  Oh, Zach! 
[00:46:30]  Zach!  That's funny.  You know what?  I just saw him for a second.  I'm like...  Yeah, that looked like Zach.  It's like, oh, he's doing his stand and shit.  Okay, cool.  I didn't realize that was him.  All right.  I thought in 2001, that looked like Zach in, like, 1989.  Good gig.  Oh, look.  Listen to this shit.  It's bad, right?  Let me see what she looks like.  I am a poster girl with no poster.  A poster girl with no poster.  She has a nice voice, though.  Yeah.  This is, like, that generic kind of...  When was she big? 
[00:47:00]  Nineties.  Yeah, nineties.  Nineties.  Yeah, nineties.  She very well could have played the fair I went to.  She's still very pretty.  She's pretty well known in that scene, I guess, but...  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's very popular.  The rug chewing scene.  That's about the scene, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  A girl I dated years ago who hates me to this day.  She was in college.  I was 28.  I was way too old for her.  But her friend was an Annie DeFranco fan, but she was getting closer to her friend and  kind of getting ready to dump me.  Oh.  So I always insult her by proxy of insulting Annie DeFranco.  By proxy.  I called her a hairy, pitted carpet muncher. 
[00:47:30]  Did it really annoy her?  Did it work?  Yeah, yeah.  Did you win her over?  No, I didn't.  Because I was insulting her friend through insulting Annie DeFranco.  Annie DeFranco.  Annie DeFranco.  No.  Annie.  Whatever it is.  Annie.  There's a guy named Dan Byrne who I like very much, who kind of is like, we've toured  with her a lot.  Yeah?  Yeah, he's kind of like Bob Dylan-ish, but I always enjoyed him.  Who else would play at Lilith Fair?  Too hip for the room.  Who headlined?  Was that Missy Elliott?  No, Sarah McLachlan.  Oh, of course. 
[00:48:00]  The old limping puppy fucking singer herself.  Who did you pretend to like?  Were you like, yeah, this is actually really good now?  Sarah McLachlan, maybe?  Who did you actually like that?  None of them.  All I remember is Sarah McLachlan played and Natalie Merchant played.  Oh, here's the song.  I don't remember anybody else.  Did she play this?  Probably.  I don't know.  This is like, the girl Travis was dating was holding up Travis like a wounded dog.  Travis is like saying, why are you beating me?  Yeah. 
[00:48:30]  I like how they put the little words for what the animals are thinking.  What did I do wrong that you poked my eyeball out?  That's not what the animals are thinking.  It's just thinking food, shit, piss, food, shit, piss, pet.  Exactly.  You know, the announcer for this.  This is the one that I went to.  The announcer for this is always like, Ant, please give money to these animals.  It's never like, hey, send your money right now.  Right.  They're hurt just reading it.  Right.  They're in a studio.  There are dead fucking puppies laying around her.  But it's like, you can help this little kitten. 
[00:49:00]  I always, always think of Patrice talking about the kitten with the headache bag and thermometer  in his mouth.  Travis was just at little affair with cigarette burns all over his little arms.  Oh, Travis.  His eye is crusted shut.  Yeah, and he had a cone on his neck.  Did you have a cone on your neck, Travis?  And a disconnected number that said mother.  I'm sorry, Travis.  Travis has been abandoned by his family. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, yes.  Well, that's terrible.  Who was that, the one you went to?  Who were the big names?  Sheryl Crow, I guess.  Indigo Girls, Queen Latifah, Lisa Loeb.  I don't remember seeing any of these people.  Lisa Loeb.  What was her big song?  Lisa Loeb's Stay.  Did your period sync up with all the girls you went with?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was a mess.  This is so fucking...  Lisa Loeb.  Wait, she had the dumb glasses?  Yeah.  This song was enormous.  I know it was.  You say...  Yeah.  You say...  I want to... 
[00:50:00]  There's Lisa Loeb.  Every guy who had a nerdy girl fetish was into her.  Danny Loeb.  Of course he does.  Why, he likes nerdy girls?  Yeah, he does.  He likes that glasses thing, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  This song was huge.  Is there one picture of her without the glasses on?  Yeah.  Did they ever capture her without the glasses?  Hopefully with a fist pulling back.  Or glasses removal class.  Look at that.  Probably wouldn't recognize.  It's like Clark Kent.  Yeah.  Well, you're saying Kent wrong.  Do you get it? 
[00:50:30]  Of course.  She's Clark Kent.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Yes.  Good for you to fill that up.  Holy shit.  For the one person listening, I might not have gotten it.  Oh, that's great.  Wow.  So you, uh, did you enjoy your time there, Travis?  Whatever.  Were you like, play, stay?  Oh, Sandra Bernhardt?  Is that from that year? 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  What year is that?  99.  Sandra Bernhardt was singing back then?  She may have been doing, like, spoken word or something.  Of course.  Some real hip shit that the Lesbos loved.  I like her, though.  Sandra, I like.  Yeah.  I don't know why I had to say that.  Christina Aguilera played, like, the smallest stage possible.  Wow.  Apparently.  Was she just nobody back then?  I guess, yeah.  It was 99.  Was she Aguilera?  Yeah.  That's weird.  She's on the village stage artist.  There's main stage, second stage, and village stage.  I thought she was bigger back in 99. 
[00:51:30]  I felt like she was fucking huge in 99.  I think that's when she broke.  Was she, though?  Let's see.  Nellie Furtado was on that stage?  Discography.  No, she was 93, 95, and then Mickey Mouse Club.  August 99 was when her album came out.  Yeah, so Liz Phare was in the summer.  She was just about to break.  Oh, yeah?  Wow, that's pretty cool.  Wow.  Sinead Lohan.  Who else is big on that little shitty stage? 
[00:52:00]  Aguilera.  Liz Phare.  I remember when Liz Phare became a pop artist, and all the feminists turned on her.  Helen Furtado.  Furtado, yeah.  Turned their muff to her.  Yeah, they fucking denied her.  I've got to turn my muff to you.  There's a lot of performers there.  Brie, oh, Brie's a friend of mine.  Okay, Brie Sharp.  I like her.  She sang this song about David Duchovny, Why Won't You Love Me?  Do you remember that?  No.  No.  No, it was a big song.  Really?  Was it?  Yeah.  She's from New York.  I don't remember that one. 
[00:52:30]  So, that's what I did once.  All right.  That's not...  It's not as gay as dancing.  No.  No, no, no.  Dancing's the gayest thing you could do to try to get a girl.  Everyone will forget to still remember your dancing.  Oh, what an asshole.  I had to dance with a girl at Comic Con.  Well, you were goofing.  Well, Jim and me.  For a goof, you could do it.  For a goof.  For the show.  You told the girl that I could dance?  Oh, yeah.  We and Sam went out to a club because I was talking to this girl. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, boy.  And the girl was like, do you want to dance?  I'm like, no, but he's really good.  So, fucking Sam's a trooper.  He went out on the dance floor.  I just talked to the girl.  It wasn't nowhere.  We just chatted.  She's beautiful.  Would you like to dance?  But I felt so uncomfortable.  So, I started dancing even worse than I normally do because I wanted it to end quicker.  Like, I was just going, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Sam was awful.  But he's doing the lean in.  When you're uncomfortable dancing, you lean in and talk to try to just keep her face away from watching your dance moves. 
[00:53:30]  There's no way to dance and look good.  No.  If you're a guy, it's very difficult to do if you're just a regular guy.  You've got to be kind of gay, maybe.  You've got to be like a black guy can fucking dance and it's cool.  But just a regular guy, guy, no.  And girls are always like, come on, let's dance.  Shut up.  Yeah, dance on this, whore.  And you point at your prick.  Yeah, you guys didn't even try to dance at the wedding. 
[00:54:00]  No.  Why wouldn't you?  Because Samuel Jackson was fucking, had all the girls around him dancing.  Yeah, he did.  Jesus.  That guy looked just like him.  Yeah, fucking, uh, who else was out there?  Uh, who was that?  Troy.  No, no, no, no.  Not Troy.  Troy.  Kenny's always got a little.  A Troy shout out.  Troy.  No, the guy, Ron Wood.  Is that who?  Oh, Charlie Watts.  Oh, God, Charlie Watts.  Lyle Lovett.  Charlie Watts.  Is that fucking lady?  From Cavs Monthly. 
[00:54:30]  As a woman, you never want to look like Charlie Watts.  No, you don't.  That's a terrible person to look like for a fucking lady.  No, you don't.  Your wife looks like Charlie Watts.  Thank you.  No one's ever said that.  Thank you very much.  Should we eat?  Yeah, let's eat.  And, uh, uh, there's, I guess someone on the phone, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we've got  to get to the bottom of that.  Yeah, we'll do it.  Because, uh, you know, poor, poor guy.  Somebody hacked somebody's Twitter.  And, uh, you know, I guess they should be able to defend themselves that it wasn't really 
[00:55:00]  them putting such horrible things out over Twitter.  He was upset that he got hung up on yesterday on the after show because I had an actual  guest.  Well, let me tell you something.  Adam Richman from, uh, you know, the sandwich guy.  I don't, no, I don't know.  I'll tell you.  It's, uh, it's, uh, yeah, no, I, I'll, I'll deal with this.  Good.  Yeah.  Let's eat.  Mmm.

[00:57:00]  Ooh, look at us.  I guess this song doesn't mean anything.  He knows better.  He doesn't get topical.  He doesn't get topical on this program.  Program.  Oh.  Hi, everyone.  Oh, I wanted to get to a phone call.  You did.  That's what we were doing before we were rudely interrupted by eating. 
[00:57:30]  Uh, yeah.  Hello, sir?  Hello?  Hello?  Yes.  Uh-oh.  Where's that?  Who's this?  How are you?  It's Bobo's mom.  Oh.  Oh, hi.  Hello, madam.  Hi.  Where is young Daniel?  Oh, well, young Bobo is in the shower and he told me to hold up to the phone.  You're a very tolerant woman.  We finally get to his phone call and he's not there? 
[00:58:00]  No, he is beyond the phone, but the thing is, when he handed me the phone, I got to hear  how Jimmy's going to lick me with that commercial he just had on.  Oh, the, uh, the sexy job.  Oh, well.  Wow.  Uh, all right.  Well, maybe we could get to the bottom of this, uh, with you here, uh, Bobo's mom.  Um, what happened to young Daniel's, uh, Twitter account?  And Facebook account.  And Facebook.  Twitter account's a Facebook account also.  It's like somebody hacked into it. 
[00:58:30]  Mm-hmm.  And we don't know what's going on with it.  We just happened to be looking at it when he was on there and then he just clicked off.  Uh, did they, they, they wrote some pretty awful things I hear, right?  Yeah.  Uh, yeah.  I didn't get to look at all of it, but, um, if his looked at it and, um, uh, his uncle  was going to look into it because he's a computer geek, whatever.  So maybe we can figure out what happened.  Bobo's uncle.  It's a whole family thing going on.  All right.  Look, I, I, I, how did, uh, hold on. 
[00:59:00]  How did Bobo's password, who did he give it to?  Oh.  We, we don't know.  If somebody, he said he didn't give it to anyone.  Somebody must have hacked into it.  We don't know.  Hmm.  I'm going to figure it out.  He probably gave it to somebody thinking they were a girl.  Daniel will sometimes give out his, um, his, uh, passwords.  You think?  Sometimes.  Yeah.  He's done it before.  Yeah.  You and his dick.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Sometimes, sometimes, ladies like to, uh, say, ah, you know, hey, Bobo, let me have the 
[00:59:30]  password and, you know, I'll, I'll write back to you or something.  And he's like, okay, and then, meh, meh.  All right.  Let me see if he's out in the shower and I'll get, get him back on.  Oh, boy.  Here comes a psycho scene.  Yeah, exactly.  No, man.  Fresh Bobo.  Let me see.  Oh.  He's going to be naked.  Oh.  Naked Bobo.  Naked Bobo.  He's going to be on the phone with us.  Naked Bobo on the phone.  He's been in the studio.  What's the difference? 
[01:00:00]  I just washed my hair and I can't do a thing with it.  Oh.  Freshly shaven, except for a couple of spots.  Hi, Bobo.  Look, you're back, you're back on the show.  As I say, that's not, like, the really circumstance I wanted to get back on, but.  Not really the circumstance.  Right, right.  What would have been the good, what would have been an ideal circumstance to get back on  the show, Bobo?  Well, maybe, maybe some bit or maybe something that was taking place.  For the, for the show.  Yeah, exactly.  Something for the show.  So, now what. 
[01:00:30]  Maybe me showing up at a live event.  Oh, well, right.  It's either this or us berating his nude body in the studio.  Are you nude, Bobo?  Bobo, are you nude right now?  Oh, he got a freaking towel.  You got a towel on?  Yeah.  Is your mom there next to you?  No.  Oh, where's your mom?  Where'd she go?  Well, she's in the living room.  In the living room.  Cool.  Can you reach the living room with the phone you're on?  Some wireless?  What? 
[01:01:00]  No, I can't reach the living room.  I'll give you five bucks to walk in and just take the towel off and go, look what you've  created.  He's on the, he's on the cell phone.  You're on the cell phone, Bobo.  Bobo, you ever see old school when Will Ferrell streaks?  Yeah.  Bobo, can you just drop your towel, right?  Streak through the living room.  What you're creating?  Look what you're creating.  He's like, look what you're creating.  He's not behaving.  Look what you're creating. 
[01:01:30]  Ah, shit.  What did she say, Bobo?  She said, what the fuck is the hell back up?  I heard her say, are you not behaving?  Are you not behaving?  Holy shit.  Can you imagine what it's like to live in that house?  It's got to be like an insane asylum.  Fun, fun, fun is what it's like.  Fun.  It sounds like a pisser to me. 
[01:02:00]  Wow.  Bobo, see what you're creating.  See what you're creating.  And he's laughing as he's saying it.  Put your fucking towel back on.  So, Bobo, what happened with your Twitter account?  I don't know.  What happened was that it was all of a sudden reached through his tweets that I didn't post.  Right.  But now, I'm kind of guessing something happened that has happened before.  A girl probably said, hey, can I have your password?  And you said yes because you thought she'd be your boyfriend, a girlfriend. 
[01:02:30]  Right?  Yes, something like that.  You did give a girl your password, right?  Yes, something like that.  How the fuck are you so stupid to keep falling for that, Bobo?  They're guys.  Aw.  Well, it's like a kid.  I don't trust any ladies on the internet.  They're not ladies.  I don't trust any ladies.  You trust all of them.  It annoys me.  You're very trusting, Bobo.  You've got to be a little more, you know, you've got to watch who you're giving information to. 
[01:03:00]  Was it the girl from Facebook yesterday, Bobo?  Was it her?  Yeah.  Aw.  What girl from Facebook?  Some girl who just happened to join Facebook 23 hours before getting in touch with Bobo and posted a stock girl photo that you find on Google Images wanted Bobo to call into the show and profess his love to her.  Yeah, that's why Bobo called into the after show yesterday, because he said that some girl on Facebook had said that she wanted him to call in.  And I'll have sex with you. 
[01:03:30]  Bobo, what did she say, or whatever it is, what did she say to get your password from you?  No, I think she wanted to inspect my e-mail.  What's that?  She wanted to inspect my e-mail.  She wanted to inspect your e-mail?  For what?  You fucking gave your password to somebody who wanted to inspect your e-mail?  What's the matter with you?  Bobo, comment.  I feel horrible.  You should.  You should. 
[01:04:00]  Bobo, how many times have I called you and told you to stop believing these people?  That's a lot.  So, why would you let a girl inspect your e-mail?  I've never seen people do that to me on Facebook before.  Oh, the new angle.  But why would you give your password?  What possible reason could a girl who's going to fuck you have for wanting your password?  She did fuck them.  No, let's just say so.  No, no, no.  And that wanted to know I wasn't cheating or anything. 
[01:04:30]  Cheating!  So, you weren't cheating.  What a brilliant scam.  This is second only to Nigerian.  You have 10 million bucks waiting here for you.  Scamology.  Do you have the picture of this girl?  Nope.  Well, we're asking Travis.  Travis.  Bobo, I'm amazed at you.  How do you keep falling for these tricks time and time again?  I don't know.  Probably my eagerness.  Your eagerness. 
[01:05:00]  His Facebook's gone?  Oh, that page is gone.  Why'd they get rid of his Facebook?  It's just, I don't know.  It's not funny.  It's like, it's mean.  Oh, they deleted your Facebook, Bobo?  I purposely had a friend of mine make some phone calls.  Oh, okay.  I set it down before anybody could.  Really, Bobo?  Do you have to get on the phone?  Do you have to call some people?  Bobo.  Bobo.  Yeah.  Now, do you have a new Facebook account?  Did you get it back? 
[01:05:30]  Did you delete everything?  Yeah, exactly.  I'm working.  I'm going to set up a new one.  All right.  Why are you continually giving your password out?  He says very desperate.  Now, I know you want to get pussy, but what are you doing?  Why don't you think for a second?  Like, what motive?  She wanted to make sure I wasn't cheating on her.  You've never met her.  And you've never had sex with a woman.  Yeah.  You couldn't, there's no possible thing in either direction that you could have cheated 
[01:06:00]  on anyone.  Right.  Oh, I messed up so many chances in the past.  That was a guy, Bobo.  These aren't chances.  They're not girls.  They're not real girls.  They're fucking guys pretending to be girls to fuck with you.  Oh, well, now I know for sure.  For sure.  You knew for sure months ago when this happened last time.  They'll never do it again, right, Bobo?  Yeah, I'll never do it again.  No one should ever ask for your password.  I don't care if it's a girl's voice on the phone. 
[01:06:30]  Never give your fucking password to anyone.  Oh, that's what's going to happen now.  I'm not giving you a password.  It should have happened already.  You're a grown-up.  You're a fucking adult, Bobo.  You are, contrary to popular belief.  You're not a fucking child.  You're a grown-up.  Yeah.  Go to the ball game all by yourself.  You're standing there with your fucking nuts hanging out.  And your towel.  Right?  How's Mr. Malunigan? 
[01:07:00]  How's Mr. Malunigan doing?  He's doing good right now.  He's Cocker Spaniel, right?  No, I don't know what kind of dog he is.  What kind of dog is Mr. Malunigan?  No, he's a schnoodle.  He's a schnoodle.  Bobo, why don't you just pay for a woman's services?  Yeah.  Why don't you just save up a couple hundred bucks and just fuck a woman that way?  I'll buy him a blowjob.  I'll buy you one.  Oh, there you go.  All right, I'll take the offer.  All right. 
[01:07:30]  He's taking the offer.  How do we get Bobo a blowjob?  How do we get him something from a woman?  This is ridiculous.  Yeah.  This guy's desperate to fucking get a load off.  He really is.  Do you think that might make the problem worse, though?  So that once he...  How could it?  He's giving his pants.  How could it make it worse?  I don't think it could.  I think he's so...  How?  Once you get a taste for blood.  Dude, but how could it make this worse?  He'll just want it all the time.  How old are you, Bobo?  No, I'm 30. 
[01:08:00]  You're 30.  What are we waiting for?  Bobo, how long have we known you?  You've known me since 08.  Four years.  Since you were 26.  Wow, you were 26, and now you're 30.  My God, Bobo.  Yeah, but he's come so far.  Yes, you really have.  No, he hasn't come in anyone.  Oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  You know, that's just mean.  I'm sorry, Bobo.  I thought that's what we were talking about.  Yeah.  Bobo, you've got to stop giving people your password. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Oh, Bobo, why would you give anyone your password, Bobo?  Oh, Bobo, why would you do that, Bobo?  Bobo, Bobo.  Bobo, why would you give anyone your password, Bobo?  Bobo, that's not really going to do bad things with it, Bobo.  That's what's your secret, Bobo.  Why would you give anyone your password, Bobo?  Okay, you're going with the David Engel.  David Engel.  Rob is on the phone.  Rob is the guy that helped you get your Facebook offline?  Yeah.  Hi, Rob.  How are you?  Good morning, guys.  So you helped Bobo out.  Yeah, listen, I'm the guy that three years ago, when he needed the tickets to go to opening 
[01:09:00]  day at Citi Field, and I called the show, and you guys put me through to him.  Yeah.  So every time the Mets are home, I get a phone call now.  He has his mother call me.  Every fucking day, every time he's in trouble, because I'm the guy that, at the time Kenny  was going to have him locked up, he called me to bail him out of jail.  And I told him to go fuck himself.  I forgot.  And he brought him downstairs.  Yes.  I said, so an idiot, who did you give your fucking password to? 
[01:09:30]  Oh my God, it's so hard.  Mr. Mets fan or something, it's like the fucking hardest thing anybody could ever do.  Shit.  Anybody that knows him, it's got to be something either about the fucking Mets or about the  dog.  Yes, yes.  Oh, you maloony good master.  I want to thank you guys for making my life miserable for the last three years.  Oh, no problem.  Thank you.  Every, thank you, you're speaking for every listener, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  No problem, guys.  All right.  Thank you for helping Bobo out there, Rob. 
[01:10:00]  Take it easy.  And Bobo, we're going to let you go now and dry your ass.  We would like to help.  What's your new password so we can help secure it?  No, I'm not giving it out of my way.  Just so we can help.  It's for us, though.  We're not.  So we can help secure it.  We need to help secure your emails.  Could you please help secure it?  Please give us your new password.  I need a giant Nigerian email, crap.  I want to see if you're cheating.  That's very good.  What a gag.  That was a test, Bobo.  You just got an A+.  You passed the test.  Good job.  Way to go, buddy. 
[01:10:30]  Is there going to be any passwords or anything leaked?  Actually, I don't think anyone's even going to figure it out.  It's not even anything obvious with me.  Well, what's a hint?  What's like a hint?  Well, here's the thing.  I haven't picked a password yet because I haven't set up all the stuff yet.  What are you leaning towards?  What is it probably going to be?  Well, I haven't decided yet.  There's nothing what it's leaning for.  It just might be completely random.  You're not going to even know.  Yeah, but how are you going to remember it?  Oh, boy.  That's tough, right?  I'll make sure I'll remember it. 
[01:11:00]  I'll make sure I freaking remember it until I'll freaking write it down.  Then after I remember the password, run that thing through a shredder.  Okay, good.  Why would you write it down?  Yourself.  Perfect.  Write it down and then run it through a shredder so you won't forget it.  Are you going to have a new Twitter account?  Yeah, I do, too.  I think I got a second one that I've used.  It probably has the same password.  No, I bet it does.  Well, if the person who hacked Bobo's Twitter account listens to the show, just give him 
[01:11:30]  back the Twitter account.  Maybe they'll don't listen.  Maybe it's just a random person.  Could just be a random person, right?  Oh, Bobo.  All right, look.  We're going to let you go, okay?  Bobo.  All right.  He's disappointed.  Why don't you just cut the shit?  Stop the sad sack routine.  It's irritating me.  You're a grown-up.  You don't give your fucking password out to some guy with a guy.  Some guy pretending to be a girl.  Girls don't do that.  Hold on. 
[01:12:00]  I'm on the phone.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, that was my mother.  Yeah, we know.  We assumed there wasn't the fucking dog talking to you, David Barkowitz.  Mr. Maloonigans told me to shoot people who were kissing in cars so I would not begin  murdering them.  By the way, how come you made us wait while you were in the shower?  I had to shower.  Well, you know what you want to do?  Is your towel on right now?  Yeah, I got my towel on. 
[01:12:30]  I got my towel on.  I dare you to take your towel off and walk in the living room and say, bitch, the next  time those motherfuckers ass-swall me, give me the motherfucking phone.  You should do that, Bobo.  With no towel on the phone.  No towel.  No towel.  I just got my fucking devil.  Give me the motherfucking phone.  Where?  My mom says she's going to kick your gutty back, dude.  Bobo.  I go sit there naked. 
[01:13:00]  When you said that just now, were you nude?  Yep.  No, I went in the creepy flasher direction.  Ah, okay.  Only I had a towel instead of a trench coat.  It's always for the bit.  Oh, so you opened it up for her.  Yeah.  All right.  Good job.  Yeah, I did that exactly like the trench coat creeped you.  Yes, we know, Bobo.  Oh, my God.  Stop giving your password out.  It's never a girl.  Giving your password out is never going to lead you getting blown. 
[01:13:30]  Right.  Ever.  Exactly.  I don't know for sure.  Everyone knows that, though, dude.  My fucking 10-year-old nephew knows that.  Yes.  Next one might be real, though.  Yeah, right?  That's all you got to tell him.  That's what he's thinking.  It could be true.  This is the one.  All right, Bobo, we're going to let you go, okay?  All right, you guys have a good day.  I need to go walk these dogs.  You showered to walk the dogs? 
[01:14:00]  Oh, I don't want to look like a vet when I'm outside.  Good call.  You got any plans for today?  Nothing yet.  He just told you.  He's got to walk the dogs.  That's it?  Well, so far, that's what it is.  Why are you up so early?  To walk the dogs.  Well, first, let's put it this way.  My alarm clock is ecstasy of gold when you guys are online.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Right, it's ecstasy of gold.  Like, the first thing I hear is the show. 
[01:14:30]  Literally, your voice is...  How come you haven't been in studio for a while?  Almost a year.  Yeah.  I haven't been asked.  Has it been a year?  I read on your Twitter last night that you're going to go to another show.  Yeah, you kind of see why someone...  You kind of see how that wasn't me.  People were tweets to whoever messed with my Twitter.  Right, well, we know you've been doing the Stern Show, so is that where you're going?  Nope.  All right, Bobo. 
[01:15:00]  All right, Bobo.  Go walk your dog.  You think you miss him?  All right, yeah.  And then you start talking to him.  I know.  Then you realize...  And then I got to go do all the stuff on...  Take care of all that stuff with my password and everything.  Right.  You got to go...  Where are you going?  Yeah, where are you going?  To the fucking Password Center in Queens?  You know, you got to get on the computer and fix everything.  Right.  Maybe he doesn't even know what he's going to do.  One good password could be Bobo, except zeros instead of Os. 
[01:15:30]  Well, the thing is, you guys don't know the password.  Good call.  The thing is, you don't know the password.  He's right.  Yeah.  And that whole thing I said, what I was going to do, and about writing it down on a piece  of paper, then after I remembered it, running that paper through a shredder, that's exactly  what I'm doing.  Oh.  Oh.  You're writing it down right now?  Well, I'm going to when I'm setting the whole thing up.  It's good when people reflect on that.  That thing that I said I was going to do, I'm going to do. 
[01:16:00]  I'm going to do.  You know what would be a good way to remember it?  Take a picture of the paper with the password on it, and then post it on your Twitter, and  that way you could always look on your Twitter and see what it is.  No, that's the Nigerian email scam also.  Oh, it is?  It's true.  Never heard of that one.  It's true.  Or the equivalent of it.  Mm-hmm.  He's right.  Same outcome, right?  Might be a different premise, but same outcome.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  All right, Bobo.  Well, you have a great day there, Bobo, okay? 
[01:16:30]  Okay, Bobo.  Tell your mom we said bye.  All right.  You guys have a good day.  All right, Bobo.  I hear from you guys whenever I hear from you back.  All right, Bobo.  Well, take it easy.  There he goes.  Bobo.  Yeah, you do kind of realize after you talk to him for a couple of minutes, you're like,  oh, right.  Oh, right.  That guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Boy.  He just...  It's got to be rough.  Every time.  It's got to be rough to want to get laid so bad and have that element of hope, that sliver 
[01:17:00]  of hope that you think that maybe this girl that is asking for my password so she could  check my email to see if I'm cheating on her, that I've never met her before, or it doesn't  make any sense, to think that maybe this is the one.  It's that thing that, like, okay, I know this is a bad idea, but there's a small chance that it could  work out well, and then you do it, and then you immediately realize you've made a stupid mistake. 
[01:17:30]  It's called hope.  Bobo's whole life reminds me of how I think when I've been up for three days.  Like, that crazy fucking nothing makes sense, I'm kind of in a high alternate reality thing.  That's how Bobo's whole life is.  That's his entire life.  But it annoys me, because it's like, you're not that dumb, dude.  Stop being such a fucking wishful idiot.  Like, just use your common sense.  He has some common...  That annoys me.  It's like, you're not some victim. 
[01:18:00]  Fucking cut the shit.  That's the annoying thing, is that he's not completely retarded.  Like, he's incredibly functional, and I'll talk to him on the phone, because, like, you  know, as much as we make fun of him, like, I'll see this stuff online, and I'll call him,  and I'll say, dude, you've got to stop doing this.  Like, you know, you're hurting yourself here.  And then you realize that, like, after you tell him all this stuff, all he says is, okay,  when can I come on the show?  So it's like, you know it's in one ear, out the other.  That's why it annoys me.  It's like, you feel bad for him, and then you immediately don't feel bad for him. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, it's like, all right, stupid, keep fucking up.  It's like I'm talking to my three-year-old.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because he's got two obsessions, and one is getting on the show for no reason, and the  other is getting laid.  And so, that's all that's in his head ever.  I would get him a blowjob.  I would love to get Bobo a whore.  Enough already with making this guy wait.  He's 30 years old, and no girls are fucking him.  Yeah.  Let's just do that.  Yeah.  He's 30, for the love of God.  I mean, it's ridiculous.  At least get him a handjob.  Why haven't we even sent this guy to the Bunny Ranch? 
[01:19:00]  Like, it's legal there.  That was a two-year discussion.  What was the problem with it?  Was it, I mean, was the official word that they never got sponsors?  I don't remember.  Oh, I think it was also...  But I think Dennis would comp him a girl.  Yeah, that's what it was.  That's what it was.  They didn't want to do a trip to the Bunny Ranch, because while Dennis would comp him, I believe this was a problem.  Dennis would comp them, but he wouldn't buy spots.  Who gives a fuck?  Jesus Christ. 
[01:19:30]  Who gives a fuck?  I think so.  I think that...  Yeah, I don't think the company wanted to pay to send him out to get a prostitute.  It's legal there.  It's all legal.  It's all legal.  He's of age.  He's not fucking profoundly retarded.  No, he's just a dude.  He's a guy that...  Show the guy a good time.  Hasn't been laid.  Jesus.  Fucking...  Ugh, I'm so disgusted anyway.  What a little fucker.  Nothing surprises me that they do.  No, no.  It really isn't.  I mean, it really doesn't surprise me.  Nothing. 
[01:20:00]  Well, hopefully...  At least send him to a masseuse or something.  Yeah, there you go.  Give him a nice masseuse.  We did to David.  Yeah, see?  Yeah.  Remember?  These guys are men.  They're not fucking little boys.  Like, they're men.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let the guy fucking...  So what?  He's not the smartest dude.  He's got a dick and he wants to use it.  He wants to cum.  He wants to cum!  I still think that would throw him into a tailspin.  You think it would be like...  Yeah, I really do.  He would just get addicted to that?  Because think about how obsessed he is with it now. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, you'd think he'd be like...  Whatever girl he was with, he'd be trying to call her all the time and showing back up  at the massage.  We've created a rapist.  Yeah.  Because, I mean, look at what happens when we don't let him on the show.  You know?  He just doesn't stop.  It doesn't stop.  It doesn't stop.  And obsesses and obsesses and obsesses.  And you give him a blowjob and then you take it away from him.  Well, let's say get him on.  Let's rephrase that.  Yeah, right?  What are you saying?  Give him a blowjob.  And then you take it away from him.  But that's how it is for every man.  Every man gets blown and wants to get blown again. 
[01:21:00]  That's true.  Yeah.  I think he...  I don't know if he'd be more obsessed with it after than he is now.  Maybe he would be, but so what?  That's what men do.  Yeah.  The guy wants to get...  This guy not getting fucking laid is cruel.  It really is.  It's fucking cruel.  Yeah.  He looks at girls all day and fucking has no knowledge of what it's like to fuck one  of them or to get blown even.  And it's not a Patty situation where Patty doesn't want to have anything to do with that. 
[01:21:30]  Wow, man.  Bobo desperately wants to get laid.  Yes.  Honey.  And so what if he gets obsessed?  He's already obsessed with it.  He is.  He's doing his passport out to men.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm not saying that my point should be a deterrent.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I understand why that would be like, well, we got to be careful, but just get him a massage  then.  Yeah.  Even if it's not a hand job, just get a sexy girl to massage him and we'll tell him you  can't touch her, you can't do any of that shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, let him get a sexy girl to massage him. 
[01:22:00]  Just feel a girl's hands on his body.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Imagine the sounds he'd make.  He'll babble through the whole thing.  Oh, he would.  It might go be an Anthony show.  Ugh.  I'm a bubble.  I don't think you know who I am.  It'll look like a fucking slug trail all over when he turns over on his back.  There's a little pre-cum.  So much pre.  Did I spill the lotion?  No.  It's pre.  So much pre.  Here comes the pre.  So much pre.  Quiet, sexy voice that he gets.  He goes, oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a creep.  Well, there's your little Bobo update.  I guess he's fine.  He's just a guy who wants to blow a load.  I know.  For fuck's sake.  Poor bastard.  Poor bastard.  It's been 30 years, right?  It's amazing.  Help me out, Hendry.  Yeah.  I'm trying to bang this species.  Poor guy just wants to cum.  I guess there's another retard segue. 
[01:23:00]  Which one is that?  Well, I got Dave Mustaine and Joe Biden.  Mustaine, I would say.  Mustaine is great.  The Biden thing is hilarious.  What did Biden do?  I didn't hear that.  Because Biden is just a fucking idiot.  He was trying.  This is quick.  The Mustaine thing we're going to dwell on for a while, I'm sure.  Now, how would you take this?  Obama says it's obvious what Biden was saying and what he meant. 
[01:23:30]  He meant it figuratively.  Let's listen to Biden and you tell me what he means here and what his intentions are.  Romney wants to let the...  He said the first hundred days.  Pause real quick.  Where is he saying this?  Um, was it in front of him?  Is he addressing a group?  Yes, he's addressing a large group.  A large group?  He's like campaigning.  Okay.  Campaigning, one of those big groups of people.  Okay.  But I do believe there were a lot of black people in the audience.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Romney wants to let the... 
[01:24:00]  He said the first hundred days.  He's going to let the big banks once again write their own rules.  Unchain Wall Street.  They're going to put you all back in chains.  He said he's going to do nothing about stopping the practice of outsourcing.  Can white Democrats stop embarrassing yourselves by trying to speak like black people when you address them? 
[01:24:30]  They don't need you to do that to understand what you're saying.  This is such an obvious ploy to, you know, they're going to put you all back in chains.  That's our vice president in that embarrassing diction?  Yes.  Now, Obama was trying to, you know, clean up after him yet again.  Yet again.  And said, well, you know, he meant figuratively in chains.  And the bankers and the banking institutions and Wall Street, they're going to take the chains off of them and put the chains back on the working man. 
[01:25:00]  No, it's a slavery reference.  No, it's a slavery reference.  It's obvious the way he was saying it.  Yeah.  And it's a very divisive thing that both campaigns have been doing.  And there's no reason to not just identify that for what it is.  He improv'd it and that's what came out.  Let's listen to it again because I love the way he gets into that black fucking speak.  Same thing Hillary did.  Black speak.  It's fucking embarrassing.  It's fucking embarrassing. 
[01:25:30]  And he reached up.  He reached up like, eh, chains.  Like he's trying to be fucking Martin Luther King.  And when has he ever said y'all?  Never!  Y'all, that's another thing.  Y'all, stop it.  Put y'all back in chains.  You're the vice president, motherfucker.  Sound like it.  I mean, Republicans, for as annoying as they can be when they talk, one thing they don't do is this.  Yes.  Hate Romney, hate all of them, but they don't do this phony, I'll speak like I'm from the...  Do you understand how fucking embarrassing and paternalistic that is? 
[01:26:00]  Yes.  I'll talk to these people.  Yeah, yeah.  I speak their language.  I know how to do it.  I got him.  I got him.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah, no, no, no.  I know how these, I know how the underclass speaks.  I speak their language.  Don't you worry about it.  It's fucking embarrassing.  You want to hear it again?  Yeah.  Romney wants to let the, he said in the first hundred days, he's going to let the big banks  once again write their own rules.  Unchain Wall Street. 
[01:26:30]  They're going to put y'all back in chains.  Let it go for another second.  Going to put y'all back in chains.  But you know that he does another one too.  Yes.  He said he's going to do nothing about...  He said he's going to do nothing.  ...practice of outsourcing.  He said he's going to do nothing.  And then you can hear when he says outsourcing, he's starting to shift back into white speak.  Well, that's a white world. 
[01:27:00]  See that, when you talk to white people about white things, you sound dignified.  Yes.  But when you want to talk to black people, you don't speak like you're talking to corporate  America.  Yeah.  Because they won't get that.  So what you do is, y'all know...  Yeah.  Oh, we got it, Mr. Batten.  Do you understand how fucking racially fucking pandering that is?  What phoniness that is?  Yet, because he's a Democrat...  They won't kill him in the media court.  ...they really won't jump on him about it.  It's been in the news, it's a story, but it's not something like, oh my goodness, we demand 
[01:27:30]  an apology for something, I don't know what you'd apologize for, sounding black?  Yeah.  Ah, y'all!  He gonna do nothing, let me tell you, I be the vice president of these here's United States.  God, that's embarrassing.  It's so embarrassing.  And Hillary did it too, that is such...  Do we have the Hillary one?  Oh, no.  Where's the...  Oh, no, I can't even listen to that one. 
[01:28:00]  I gotta hear it.  I gotta hear it now.  Something tired?  That ain't me, Longwood, no way, tired.  Is Iraq freaking out?  I don't think someone was listening.  Oh, hold on.  Iraq?  Iraq?  Do you have it?  What'd he say?  He didn't say anything to me.  Iraq!  Are you there?  Do you have it?  Do you have it?  No, I don't.  Why not?  Because I didn't hear what you said.  What are you doing in there?  Oh, my God.  What are you doing in there?  I was looking up something.  What were you looking up?  What were you looking up?  We were looking up something to do with Bobo's Twitter.  Oh, my God.  He was at a wrestling site. 
[01:28:30]  Wrestling site?  I will just find what we asked you for, please.  All right.  Do you know what it is?  He's gotta go back and listen to the show.  Do you know what it is?  We need this now.  I don't know.  I didn't hear it.  I apologize.  You don't know what we're looking for?  And he didn't ask.  This is what we tell the interns.  You gotta ask.  Instead of pretending that you know, you just say, well, I don't know what you asked for.  No, I said, I didn't hear what you said.  And then I said, are you gonna find what we need?  And you went, yes.  But how do you know?  Because I'm gonna go listen back to what you just said and I'll pull it up.  I know that, but that's time consuming. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  I'm not being unreasonable to go, you're on the board.  Could you listen to the fucking show?  Holy shit.  I understand it's painful.  Believe me, I'm here every day.  You're literally four feet from the show.  You think you'd listen to it.  It's a good show.  You're sitting in front of the board for the show.  He used to be a fan.  Oh, back in the old days.  I don't blame him for not being a fan, but just begrudgingly listen to it.  Have one ear on.  Yeah. 
[01:29:30]  So when we ask you for something, you can at least attempt to look for it.  Jesus.  Iraq, comment?  I didn't hear you.  Iraq.  No, why would he?  He's fucking, he's in there, what's he doing, whistling?  Iraq, we're looking for the Hillary Clinton when she was sounding black.  All of a sudden, Hillary Duff is gonna play.  He's just anything that he's.  Hillary!  Do you know where that is?  George Clinton.  I know where it is.  I'm looking for it.  Oh, okay.  He's looking for it.  Yeah, relax.  Be right there.  I have no doubts. 
[01:30:00]  It's gonna be right there.  I don't feel no ways tired.  I've come too far.  Where I started from.  Nobody told me that the road would be easy.  I don't believe he brought me this far to leave me.  Could, one more time.  Do it, do it, do it.  No!  I don't feel no ways tired.  Hold on, hold on.  No, no, I gotta hear it right from the beginning.  Okay.  Strap in.  Here it is. 
[01:30:30]  I don't feel no ways tired.  I've come too far.  From where I started from.  Nobody told me that the road would be easy.  I don't believe he brought me this far to leave me.  Ugh.  I've come too far.  What?  I did that when I was 18.  Ew.  When I was at 18, that's when I was like this fucking white black kid with the fat laces 
[01:31:00]  that I was trying to fit in.  Oh, no.  But I was 18 and drinking alcoholically.  Yeah.  But that's that child mentality of trying to fit into a room.  My favorite thing about doing interviews with Who Kid is watching which actors and celebrities  completely change their dialect if Who Kid's doing the interview.  How humiliating.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I love being the fucking whitest guy in the room because I can't do it the other way.  And that's what black people, any people want. 
[01:31:30]  You just be yourself.  They're not looking for you to change so they can understand who you're coming from.  Who is guilty of, who spoke like themselves to Who Kid?  Well, the last person who spoke like themselves, most, a lot of people have, but the last person  who was really bad about not doing it was Chris Klein from American Pie.  Chris Klein, right?  You know what I'm talking about.  Okay, what does he sound like regularly?  Like, he's just like a completely Midwest white guy sounding dude. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, no.  Like, he's just a white guy.  And he just was throwing in like, you know what I'm saying?  No.  And like, and he was doing y'alls.  And he's like, please, I ain't even about that.  Oh, no, no, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  It was bad.  That's fucking horrid.  It was bad.  It was a really bad one.  And I was sitting there and like, Who Kid said he didn't even, I talked to him after  he left.  I was like, dude, he just completely blackened his voice up because you were talking to him.  Blackened it up.  But does, but does, does Who Kid catch that? 
[01:32:30]  Or does he, maybe he doesn't know what the guy sounded like before?  Yeah, he said he didn't.  Because those people don't listen.  But does he, did he know?  He said, he said he didn't notice him doing it, but I was like.  Do black people notice that when you, they have, how do they not?  I think they have to.  It's gotta be a goof.  It's gotta be a goof.  What is that?  That's fucking awful.  What is that, Travis?  That's the interview.  I want to see if he, let's see what he says.  Let's catch it.  There's a lot of absorption going on right now, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It came out yesterday.  It is the funniest shit ever, man. 
[01:33:00]  Like.  Oh, cool.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm glad y'all enjoyed it.  We had some.  You can hear him slipping into it.  You can hear it because my headphones are.  Because naturally.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can hear.  Glad y'all enjoy it.  You can hear the natural voice saying, oh, cool.  Thank you.  I'm glad y'all enjoy it.  And he starts sliding into this soul brother.  The 1970s job talking.  Within like two minutes.  He's like, you're my nigga.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  He has no actual experience with black people.  None.  That shows you how on.  That.  That.  That's.  That's exactly it.  Yep. 
[01:33:30]  He has no fucking experience.  Now watch.  We find out that he's like a black mother.  We don't know what we're talking about.  But that's.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, there we go.  No.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  There.  I'm glad people are, you know, people are responding.  It's all good.  Were you mad you weren't invited to the wedding?  Oh, God.  I saw the wedding thing in it.  I'm like, you know, the American Pie wedding.  I didn't see one.  And listen, man, those decisions come from way above my pay grade.  You know what I mean?  I can't do it. 
[01:34:00]  Did you hear what he said?  No.  You know what I mean?  Nah, man.  And you can hear him.  He's doing this sort of like.  It's terrible.  Like that.  Like the guy who left his kids in the theater.  That white guy.  Yes.  Smooth.  That ass nonsense.  Ew.  Who's that guy in the studio with them?  That was me.  Oh.  That's so.  That's humiliating.  Well, he is in the studio with two black people.  No, it's not.  Yes.  Sam Roberts.  But that Sam said it.  Absolutely.  My man, Sam.  My man said that shit right.  Oh, man.  That's people who have no experience or comfort. 
[01:34:30]  Yes.  Around black people.  And I'm sure Biden and Hillary have dealt with.  But these are people that never have these honest talks.  And they're also like.  You're right about it.  It's pandering.  Because they want to be looked at as so.  Like they're so cognizant of being not racist.  Whatever it is.  Right.  That they're trying.  They're actually downgrading their grammar and speech.  Because they are so cognizant of being with what they say.  And it's not like racial hatred. 
[01:35:00]  Like I don't think Hillary's a racist.  I don't think Biden's a racist.  No, no, no.  But it's this really weird feeling.  It's like nobody sits there when they talk to a baby and says, hey, you want your rattle?  You always say, do you want your rattle?  You talk to the baby in a baby voice.  Like talking to a dog.  That's how you talk.  Unless you're putting it up there, little casters.  Yeah.  Well, then you say, get over here.  Put one leg there and one leg there.  Now make the swimming motion.  Kick your legs for Pete's sake. 
[01:35:30]  Make the swimming motion.  Yay.  I'll hold your thighs.  You didn't think Paul was going to take the ball and run with it?  No.  I knew he was.  But that's what that shit is, man.  It really is.  Yes.  An ingrained subordination type of thing.  No, man.  Nobody's doing it on purpose.  No.  But it's in them.  I feel you.  I feel you.  Nah, mean.  Nah, mean.  That's what he said.  Nah, mean.  Nah, mean.  Nah, mean. 
[01:36:00]  Maybe I get out of my system when I was 18 and got sober.  But that's humiliating.  Oh, God.  I would love to have seen an authentic Jimmy Norton wigger speak.  Big Daddy James.  Oh, that.  Big Daddy James.  That would have ruled, man.  Yeah.  But as embarrassing as that is for me to think about.  And that really is humiliating.  Oh.  Can you imagine if you're the vice president?  Oh, no.  Travis got another one.  Travis has been screening this.  And he's like just wincing.  Yeah.  Chris Klein. 
[01:36:30]  Man, we got Jason Biggs and Sean William Scott doing what they do.  But to bring everybody back the way that American Reunion.  I mean, we even have the Shermanator in this joint.  That's crazy.  In this joint.  Listen.  Oh, my God.  Did he just call American Pie a joint?  He did.  Dude, my neck hurts.  My neck is bothering me.  This is the Breakfast Club.  A John Hughes joint.  In this joint.  He just called the movie a joint.  Wait.  Oh, God. 
[01:37:00]  Like a Spike Lee joint.  In fairness, find him doing another interview.  That's what I'm doing right now.  With somebody he sees as an equal.  On Chelsea.  Oh, Chelsea Lately.  Okay.  He did a serious radio tour.  You got some booty.  Why would he speak differently in the one interview than any of the other interviews?  Let's see if he did, though.  Not mean?  Uh-huh.  Not mean?  No, no, no.  I know what you're saying.  I fail you.  I fail you.  I love the wire, and I don't talk like that.  I wouldn't talk that way to Snoop.  Uh-oh. 
[01:37:30]  How different is it?  It's so white.  Is it white?  I told you.  All right.  Let's hear it.  Here he is now on Chelsea.  Sits down.  Not mean.  Is it called a joint?  Really?  I got to tell you, I'm so excited to be here.  My, uh, I have a dear friend named Jamie, who is half-Jewish from New Jersey.  That is so far from what he was doing on the Who Kid interview. 
[01:38:00]  See?  What a phony lump of shit.  That makes my fucking stomach.  You know what I mean?  Now let's hear a little bit from the Who Kid interview.  Please post these side-by-side.  They're hilarious.  I love this.  Ugh.  Who?  You have a good, uh, joke.  Just play it.  I'm so embarrassed.  Move, move, move, move, move, move.  We had L. McPherson last week.  That's a Bill friend.  Oh, that's big time.  Yeah.  Hold on.  That's a billionaire Bill.  Let's just pause and think about that. 
[01:38:30]  Mm.  Ooh.  I don't want to mess up anything, but I see the father is interacting with the crazy moms  that banged out, uh, you know.  Finch.  Yeah.  Yeah, Stifler's mom.  Is that going to be an addition to the chaos to, like, the-  Hey, listen, you want me to spoil it right now?  Hey, Jason's dad is like-  Oh, where's that accent coming from?  You want me to spoil it right now?  You are spoiling it.  You want me to spoil it right now?  You don't know her.  You've never met her.  She's never met you, but in her mind-  Where's the southern twang?  Where is it? 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, wait, where is this hip-hop kid?  What's that Jewish-  Wait, he's talking about some Jew he knows from Jersey.  Oh, then he's probably going to change his voice.  And he was-  Oh, no.  Oh, is he embarrassing?  That's terrible.  Can we hear more?  I want to hear Chelsea a little bit.  A little bit from Chelsea, Josh.  Yeah, a little bit from Chelsea.  Yeah, I've already heard this mug.  Yeah.  Her maiden name?  Yeah, her maiden name.  What kind of f***ing name is Premack? 
[01:39:30]  Premack?  But she is laughing hysterically right now.  Jamie, we are friends.  We are best friends.  Okay, let's go back to the other one now.  Just to make sure that I didn't-  Maybe, yeah.  Maybe it's the same.  Oh, thank God.  Thank fucking Lord.  I guess you weren't a fan of Jill's mug.  So, no.  Jennifer Coolidge.  I mean, let's take a milf moment there.  Another one.  She don't have any kids with God.  Yo.  Oh, wow. 
[01:40:00]  Who said that?  Who did they say that?  The guy from Chelsea Handler's show.  That was the guy that was just-  How do you feel?  Man.  I just-  I want to sit him down and go,  what the f*** are you doing?  What is that?  Unless Who Kid's here,  and they go, yo, you mad crazy.  Who is that?  The f*** is up with you.  Who Kid doesn't need you to do that?  No.  He speaks, he gets it.  Let Who Kid bring you to his audience.  Don't try to, you know,  downgrade yourself.  Don't try to fit in. 
[01:40:30]  You're being interviewed for a movie.  You're not running for the f***ing mayor of Newark, stupid.  He's trying so hard.  I once used his own to seize my movie picture.  Uh-huh.  I ain't tired, no more tired.  I can't see no ways tired.  I don't feel no ways tired.  I've come too far.  Full far.  From where I started from.  Nobody told me that the road would be easy. 
[01:41:00]  I don't believe he brought me this far to leave me.  That's fantastic.  Amy is here.  Should we bring me?  Oh, the Shums be here, yo.  Yo, Amy Schumer and shit.  She be funny, too.  Amy Schumer in the house, I.  Yo, Amy's going to be bugging at the Hartford Funny Bone  this motherf***ing weekend.  Damn.  And her special, aw, shit, mostly sex stuff.  Preach it.  Yo, the bitch gets crazy.  I'll say it, dude.  It comes out, I can't even do that without feeling physically. 
[01:41:30]  It comes out this Saturday at 11 o'clock.  That's a great time, actually, to air on Comedy Central.  She's hilarious.  We'll take a quick break.  Yes, let's do that.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Obi and Anthony Show.  Ooh, just Anthony today, though.  Aw.  And Jimmy.  And Amy Schumer.  Amy Schumer's here hanging out with us.  Hi, Amy.  Morning.  Again, wow, just a bang-up job on another roast. 
[01:42:00]  Look at you.  Thank you so much.  What a weird roast, right?  It really is.  Yeah, it really was.  What was it like to watch?  Was it weird?  It was weird.  You hear about so much of the shit before it airs, though.  It's kind of odd that they pump out so much publicity on it and the jokes and things.  Yeah.  Carrie Fisher seemed really annoyed.  She was totally pissed.  Yeah.  Like, the whole time.  It's like...  Like, real.  Like, what did you think was going to happen?  I hate when people do it and they've never even watched it before.  It's like, what did you think was going to happen here, Carrie? 
[01:42:30]  You've got to get brutalized.  What do you think?  No one's going to address the fact that you're fat and you haven't worked?  Okay, I have to.  Would she seem most bothered by menopause?  Menopause, jokes?  God damn it.  It was the menopause jokes and the drug stuff.  She actually kind of came up beforehand to me and the other comics and, like, one by  one.  And it was like, you know, my daughter's here.  And I was like, oh, get out of here.  Yeah, what are you going to say then?  Yeah.  Like, the celebrity...  It's so funny.  It's such a different vibe.  Like, it's the one time where you have something over a rich-ass famous celebrity. 
[01:43:00]  They come over and they're scared of you because this is your one thing that you do.  Yeah, you can rip them to pieces.  Yeah, so just, like, Alan Barkin kind of sidled over and was like, hi.  And I was like, well, the jokes are written, bitch.  I'm not crossing anything off.  It's done, yeah.  And then she, like, someone...  Yeah, she was, like, surprised.  She was like, what did I ever do to you?  I was like, nothing.  Literally nothing.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like, what do you think this is?  Like, why do you think you're here? 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  Ugh.  That's like if you fucking...  If she had to shoot you in a movie and you were like, why would you shoot me?  It's like, well, this is what I'm doing.  It's a movie, idiot.  That's exactly what we're supposed to do here, yeah.  So, but she was really pissed off, Carrie Fisher?  Like, she was really annoyed by the menopause jokes.  And it was like, did she think she was on a highbrow network that was above making period jokes?  Yeah.  Like, what do you think you're doing here?  This is, this comes on after Tosh.  Are you looking for the BBC's fucking smart jokes? 
[01:44:00]  It's not Masterpiece Theater, you silly goose.  You tell her, Jimmy.  I did like the Gilbert Gottfried after Carrie Fisher went up and was obviously so annoyed,  just brutalized her.  Oh, God.  He annihilated her.  He, I've, I don't know that I've seen somebody, like, crush that hard in a room.  Yeah, he's amazing.  He was, it was like a whole different, I really wanted him to stop talking because I was in  pain from that.  Just screaming.  Just, I mean, he was relentless.  Yeah.  Did he say R2-D2 got more work than you did? 
[01:44:30]  Yes.  Yes.  I think that was really what, what, uh.  Was she laughing or stone-facing him?  She was, she didn't laugh.  She never laughed.  Wow.  She was real pissed.  She just sat there smoking e-cigarettes looking like the Caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland.  Why the fuck was she there?  I don't know why, I don't know why anyone would say yes to this except for the money.  Like, I think they get a lot of money.  Oh, is that it?  I think so.  I don't know.  She went on and on about it.  You don't know.  They're like, enjoy the credits.  There he is.  Yeah.  He went on and on about how sure Comedy Central was that she would absolutely be available 
[01:45:00]  for it.  If there's one thing we're sure.  Yeah.  I didn't see it.  Oh, man.  Oh, God.  You didn't see it?  He was really funny.  Put the volume on just for a second.  Just watch it for a second.  A little Gilbert.  It's not Roseanne.  It's disgusting odor of taco grease and ass cheese.  Roseanne was dying.  Her sharp yellow teeth can take a man's arm off in one bite if you are foolish enough to 
[01:45:30]  try and feed the beast her mountain of pork cracklings and one slim fast candy bar.  Holy shit.  He's fucking destroyed.  The purpose was just...  Roseanne!  Stomping through Hollywood for decades!  Breathing fire from her hairy snout! 
[01:46:00]  Turning bridge after bridge!  Her glowing red eyes striking terror in the heart of anyone!  I'm fortunate enough to look in her hideous face!  Oh, wow.  He's pounding her.  That's pretty fucking funny.  Her narrow-powering coos!  Crushing and destroying everything in her past! 
[01:46:30]  Stopping only to feed every ten minutes!  And make one sitcom decades ago!  Holy fuck.  Oh, look at Amy.  He's crying.  Swaying and crashing!  Like a Japanese moon army!  Oh, my God.  That was pretty fucking good.  Holy shit. 
[01:47:00]  And then it started going on about her tail and her colon.  Oh, her tail.  When does he kill Carrie Fisher?  Before that.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's pretty fucking good.  He killed her.  Jesus Christ.  He killed...  Oh, God.  But Roseanne was...  She was the best roastie ever.  She was dying laughing the whole time.  Oh, she's a comic.  Yeah.  She's like, you're not gonna hurt her.  Yeah, she knows what the deal is.  Yeah.  And she was like...  She didn't understand the joke.  She'd be like, what does that mean?  And I'd be like, you're fat.  She's like, okay.  Yeah, you're like, fucking...  You're in.  I think you're in there now. 
[01:47:30]  The roast?  Yeah.  Yeah, you're in.  Is that a bad thing?  No, it's fucking Amy's...  It's great for, like, your stand-up career.  But it's, like, not fun for your life.  Yeah?  Yeah, because people think, like, that that's how I do stand-up.  They think that that's part of...  You're an insult comic.  Right, and that's so not my thing.  Yeah, yeah.  I just, like, trash myself on stage, pretty much, or guys I've had sex with.  Right.  So when people come up to me, just like, you know, after this roast and the last one,  just now they're coming up and just being like, say something to me to my friend. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, no.  What would say that?  They should just say hello to you, and that would happen naturally.  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.  I'm like, who do you think I am?  And then I open fire.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah, that is kind of an odd thing to be known for if you don't do that kind of material.  But, I mean, yeah, I only do it, like, we do it sitting around constantly.  Yeah, yeah.  But, I don't know.  And that show, The Burn, Jeff Ross's show, was really fun to do.  It's like, I like writing jokes.  I like, like, you know, I like...  What exactly is The Burn? 
[01:48:30]  I know what it is, but...  The Burn?  Ask anyone you've had sex with.  Don't be the snooze.  Oh, my God.  Tuesday on The Rape.  No, I...  What exactly is it?  What are you roasting when you're on the show?  You roast, like, he kind of...  The night before, email you, like, the events that happened that week.  So, I had a couple things with the Olympics.  And, yeah, just, like, events.  And you just write the most horrific jokes you can think about it.  Well, I did.  Like, the other people didn't really do that, but... 
[01:49:00]  Oh, man.  Yeah, I was like, I'd say something, and they'd be like, oh, whoa.  And I'm like, oh, I thought that's what we were doing.  Yeah, I thought that was all gist of this thing.  But you're roasting different things?  Yeah, like, they were like...  One thing was Gabby Douglas, how NBC showed, right after she won the gold, they cut to a  commercial of, like, a little monkey.  Right, yeah, monkey on the...  And then they apologized.  So, I just played it, like, I was like, I am so glad NBC stepped up and apologized to that  monkey.  You know, it's a show, you know, so that kind of stuff. 
[01:49:30]  That's funny.  Yeah, and I was going to try to work in the joke that you gave me to maybe use, like,  being like, look, she accomplished so much, she's got the gold and taught herself how  to walk upright.  Jimmy, Jimmy, I gave you that joke.  That's great.  But yeah, they were just like, how about you don't say that on our first episode?  I was like, oh, okay.  I don't know.  They probably would have aired it, but...  Oh, boy.  And then we went around and we kind of speed roasted the audience.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's what this is...  Oh, no, that's not what this is a clip of. 
[01:50:00]  There's a clip of us, like, speed roasting.  Do you actually go up and roast at the podium?  Yeah, like, you will know you...  Everybody has their own tiny podium, and you...  Oh, I'm Jeffrey Ross, Robin.  Wow.  Is Jeffrey looking like Howard or what?  He did not want them to mess with his hair, and then they did.  They messed with it?  Can you go to the speed of it?  What did they do?  An M80.  Wow.  Oh, is this the whole episode?  Wow, they put the whole episode up?  Whoa. 
[01:50:30]  It was me, J.B. Smoove, and Ralphie Mae.  But, yeah, it was fun.  Just, you know, if you like...  Yeah, I'm doing it at the end of the month, but I haven't seen...  I've known nothing about it.  Oh, are you?  Yeah, but I don't know what exactly it is.  Jeff's like, no, we'll talk to you, like...  It's like a really mean, like, Chelsea lately.  Cool.  Which I think if he heard me say that, he'd probably punch me in the face.  But that's quite a fair point.  Yeah, and, you know, you don't have to, like, pretend to laugh at each other.  You can be like, that nice try.  Yeah, you can be like, oh, you're swinging a mess there. 
[01:51:00]  I'm going to pass on that joke you just said.  Yeah.  But I thought it was funny.  Oh, good.  I'm going to go in there, guns blazing.  Oh, yeah?  Boy, what about this election?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That'll be a good one.  Yeah.  Chip.  Can't wait to tune in.  Almost Chip?  Yeah.  Oh, jeez.  Can't quite blame everything on Chip.  How is J.B.?  He's really funny.  Yeah, he's very funny.  He's really funny.  Everybody laughs. 
[01:51:30]  And what about, how did Ralphie do?  Ralphie was funny.  He's, yeah, he was good.  Yeah.  No, that's cool.  Everybody was really good.  No, everybody was really good.  Yeah.  You know, there was one star, a shiny star.  Obviously, there's this little lady over here.  But, you know what?  It's like, being in New York, I feel like we spend more time with comedians and people that  are degenerate assholes like us.  So what we did on that show is what you would do any night. 
[01:52:00]  But I feel like guys like J.B. and Ralphie, who are on the road by themselves, mostly, whatever,  like, I don't feel like they're used to sitting, just like, like, I went after them a little  bit.  Sitting there trashing each other.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I went after, like, they talked about something with swimming and Michael Phelps peeing in  the pool.  And I was like, J.B., you're so lucky.  You won't have to worry about this.  And he just kind of looked at me like, oh, we're going to go.  And it's like, yeah, that's what we're doing here.  Oh, my goodness.  Really?  How would you say that about me?  I know.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think he just wasn't ready for it.  He was just like, whoa.  It's like, yeah, that's what this show is.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I would probably say something like, oh, I don't know. 
[01:52:30]  Well, why don't you workshop it?  You can workshop it, bring it back, and then we'll vote.  So did he have Sarah on yet or no?  Sarah, he did, like, a video at her house.  It was really funny.  Of course.  Yeah.  Yeah, Sarah's good.  Right now, Jeff's just saying.  That's a good show for him.  Don't we get smaller podiums?  Look how little those are.  They are ridiculously small.  Did you get one of my show on the first episode?  No, I'm not saying that it looks like the set was designed by the same guy who designed 
[01:53:00]  the inside of the ovens at Auschwitz.  I would not.  It's a long way to go for that joke.  Very industrial looking.  Yes, yes.  Not very much.  The set designer was like, uh.  I need you to bust balls and break stools.  This one's holding.  This one's holding.  Thank God.  I'm so shocked.  I love how Comedy Central spared every expense.  This is awesome.  Is this?  That's Tosh's TV, man.  What the fuck?  I have to go back to the apartment.  What's going on here, man? 
[01:53:30]  It's hilarious.  JB, you're awful quiet.  It's not like you.  This is crazy, man.  She is absolutely right.  There's some cheap s*** around here.  I'm telling you, man.  It's like somebody parked that Segway in the bag neighborhood and took the wheels off.  And look.  Look at his name.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's my favorite.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  I've never gotten a Segway to move, so it's just like the regular Segway.  Oh, that guy.  By the way, meet my cousin Ed real quick.  He's over there. 
[01:54:00]  He's our recent dog.  What's that?  Hey, Ed.  Oh, relax.  Relax.  Relax.  Relax.  I thought he was losing weight.  What happened?  He already has the big tits.  No?  I know what I'm going to say.  Pause this.  Oh, what were you going to say?  Boy, what are these, postage stamps?  Can we add?  Let's unpause it.  Let's unpause it.  No.  No.  That's fucking.  What are these, postage stamps?  Right?  I think it depends a lot on who you go on there with, if it's fun or not.  That'd be good.  I would imagine.  You think every week they'll do podium material before they get started?  Hey, you can put this in someone's cunt. 
[01:54:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe this isn't the right venue for you.  Maybe this isn't right.  Or, you know, next week should have giant podiums.  So then people that wrote small podium material are just fucking bamboozled.  They should just rename the show The Podium.  This is why you guys don't have a TV show right now.  Right?  Thought we were brainstorming.  I'm sorry.  Because they're too good.  Yeah, Ben was threatened.  We're spitballing.  Yeah.  Spitballing.  Why don't you take all these podiums and make one good one out of them for Pete's sake? 
[01:55:00]  These are the small podiums, by golly.  You Jew.  But I'll say, call Jeff a Jew.  That's perfect.  Good.  Keep it edgy.  Yeah, yeah.  He's actually going to close everything up.  Call him a Jew.  What is he doing with his hair?  He just doesn't care.  Look at that pimple.  That was right in my eye.  I kind of love the fact that...  It was right in your eye.  I love the fact that he just doesn't care.  Yeah.  He really doesn't.  Fucking great.  I'm pretty sure he's stoned out of his mind.  Good for him.  Good for him.  Yeah, the vibe was so late back there.  It was his first show, and he was just like, all right, we're going to have fun. 
[01:55:30]  Whatever.  He's kind of used to doing this kind of thing, right?  Yeah, but for him, it's all looks.  I mean...  Jesus, Jeff.  Yeah, right?  Look at that eye candy.  All right.  That's something to look for.  The burn.  The burn.  There you go.  We wanted to touch on...  Dave Mustaine.  Dave Mustaine.  We were talking about the wonderful vice president earlier, and his little... 
[01:56:00]  When he was speaking black to the audience.  Is there something more uncomfortable?  No.  We were just talking about...  It's terrible.  When these dumb whiteys have to...  Like, yeah, y'all.  Y'all know.  And they're in front of a bunch of black people, and black people just got to be...  I just do it with my laugh sometimes.  I'll catch myself.  Like, I'll talk like this, but if a black guy says something funny, I'll go...  That's good.  That's a good black laugh.  Feels very genuine and organic.  Totally.  Yeah.  I feel you.  I feel you.  Oh, God. 
[01:56:30]  That's so embarrassing.  It's just freaking embarrassing.  I put my head in my neck and go back up.  It was really good.  Where's Hillary?  Play the clip, Iraq.  This was our Secretary of State.  I don't feel no ways tired.  I've come too far from where I started from.  Nobody told me that the road would be easy.  I don't believe he brought me this far to leave me. 
[01:57:00]  Take a black robot.  Well, motherfucking Robinson, I'm a robot.  She's terrible.  I'm a robot.  That is...  She sounds like the other sister.  Just retarded.  She thinks black people are retarded.  Yes.  I come too far.  Wait, did you hear Biden?  Yeah.  Joe Biden just...  Biden, they're trying to pawn it off like he wasn't...  He was just figuratively saying...  It was a slavery reference. 
[01:57:30]  But it's a slavery reference, and he did it in this black-sounding voice.  Terrible.  This is this week.  Romney wants to let the...  He said in the first hundred days, he's going to let the big banks once again write their own rules.  Unchained.  Wall Street.  They're going to put you all back in chains.  He said he's going to do nothing about stopping the...  He said he's going to do nothing about stopping the...  He said he's going to do nothing.  Whoa.  Joel Beck and Chain. 
[01:58:00]  How uncomfortable is that?  Oh, my God.  That is really...  People just, like, are feeling it in the moment, and they're like, maybe I can be black right now.  Yeah.  Like, maybe I can preach.  So, when they get in a room with a lot of black people in the room, I don't think they think it's being recorded or sent out to a television or...  They think it's like, I could work with these people.  I could fucking black it up.  Because there's nothing more uncomfortable than being, feeling like a white guy in a black...  Because black people have a real rhythm.  Like, when you see a black guy fucking talking in a black room, there's a real... 
[01:58:30]  There's a really weird moving back and forth rhythm.  It's addicting.  Like, who wouldn't want to talk like fucking Martin Luther King?  Who wouldn't want to be able to do that to a room?  It's just not our thing.  We've got to go with Hitler.  Sorry.  I'm going to side with Hitler.  That's what he should have done.  He should have threw his hand up in the air and fucking pointed.  He should have Hitler'd it up.  I am the opposite.  Like, when I'm around a lot of black people, especially comics, it brings out the whitest part of me. 
[01:59:00]  You too?  Yeah, absolutely.  I, like, white it up more by accident.  Yeah.  I don't know why.  It's so...  I'm so aware of it, and you're so cognizant.  And I'll use that word, and then I'll explain it to them.  Oh, yeah.  You have to.  You become so aware of the racial difference.  It's like, you don't want to do things you've seen other people do that are uncomfortable.  Oh, it's...  That is ridiculous.  And them trying to pawn it off like he's just...  He was just figuratively saying, like, you know, we'll be back in chains.  You know, and the chains of the oppressive banking system. 
[01:59:30]  Is that what he was...  Is that what he said after?  Yeah, that's what...  Why not just be honest and go, yeah, it was a stupid thing.  Yeah, I try to jive it up, yo.  Like, Romney's going to make everyone be asleep.  Yeah, put y'all back in chains.  Put y'all back in chains.  And then he's...  He must have thought, like, the black people are going to be there going,  Oogity boogity.  I can't vote for no Romney.  We're going to be back in chains, y'all.  Oh, lordy, lord.  Nothing makes me laugh like an oogity boogity.  Oogity boogity.  Was there ever a time when a black person has ever said that? 
[02:00:00]  Never.  I've never heard it.  Never read it.  Never seen it.  I do remember one night at the cellar, and I've told a story.  It's one of my favorite at Tell Mom.  It was a Tell, yes.  And the fucking...  There were some black people just yapping and giving him a hard time,  and I think he'd had a few.  And he goes, what's that?  Your own language?  Oogity boogity.  I want a prick.  Oogity boogity.  How is that hilarious?  Oogity boogity.  Your own language. 
[02:00:30]  Oogity boogity.  Oh, does he not care at all?  He is far gone.  Oh, yeah.  Fantastic.  Then we got the other end of the spectrum, which is Dave Mustaine.  Dave Mustaine is like 50 years old, fucking played guitar and sang with Megadeth, or does  he still?  He still does.  He still does.  He still does?  Yeah.  He was with Metallica for a while, years ago.  He's still depressed about Metallica.  Of course he is.  But he's still a...  I mean, Megadeth has sold millions of records.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:01:00]  Fuck yeah.  But he, I guess he's not an Obama fan, and he's starting to make these accusations that  are a little conspiracy crazy stuff.  And this is why we should have had him on the show when he was...  Oh, man, yes.  Why would we have turned down Mustaine?  It's insanity.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are they going to play something?  Oh, we're going to play something.  We were just pondering that.  Oh, yeah.  Yo, we was just chilling back.  Yeah.  My bad.  Yo, Ames.  Oh. 
[02:01:30]  You don't like what I call you, Ames?  Uh, no.  I think the energy in the room changed.  Yeah, it certainly did.  Yo, mostly sex stuff and shit is on this Saturday, y'all.  Oh, shit, son.  Get it.  I don't know.  That was fun.  What?  What?  What did I see?  I saw an interracial video.  You can do a picture back.  It was pretty sexy.  The girl was getting fucked by a black guy, and she's like, yeah, get that pussy, daddy.  Get that pussy.  You like that?  You like that?  I did a little bit yuck.  God damn it, Jimmy.  It was so dirty.  I hate that.  Why?  But see how white he says it?  I like it. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  Hey, get that pussy.  Yeah, that's how she was.  But she meant it.  Yeah, get that pussy, daddy.  She meant it.  Yeah.  And he wanted it.  And daddy, in fairness to daddy, he certainly did.  He did.  Yeah, he ruined it for anyone else.  You just know, like, she probably has a father somewhere.  Probably not.  He probably did a horrible job of raising her.  Maybe he did a great job.  Remember what?  She responds.  When daddy says to do something, she doesn't.  Well disciplined.  Oh, boy.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
[02:02:30]  She looks like fucking Junkyard Dog, the wrestler.  Oh, my God.  There's a woman outside the studio.  Oh, my God.  Just no boundaries.  She was on the television years ago.  She was on Real World One, I think it was, right?  Is that the one who got, like, raped?  No, not that one.  No.  Heather.  She was the one that liked the-  Oh, Heather B., that rapper.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's her.  She works on Sway Show now.  That's her right out there.  Heather B.  Heather B.  Who's that?  And she was a rapper.  And she liked Larry Johnson, the basketball player. 
[02:03:00]  Wow, that is old.  Do you remember that?  Was he with the Hornets?  Oh, sorry.  What happened?  I'm just putting that together now.  Yeah, that's her.  I thought she looked familiar.  Yeah.  Yeah, see?  Real World season one.  That was season one.  Yeah, that was the first one.  That looked so shitty.  When it was real.  Yeah, when it was a real, like, hey, let's just take cameras and-  They didn't have bright couches then.  It was just, like, everyone had to share a mattress.  Yeah, yeah.  It was so fucking cool.  Before they just really cast it and put neon fucking lights everywhere and pool tables.  Yeah, and all the brightly colored pillows.  Exactly. 
[02:03:30]  If people with AIDS are on the show anymore.  Yeah, let's bring back the people with AIDS on the show.  AIDS.  You put your fingers in the peanut butter.  He was so fucking pissed at Puck.  Oh, was he mad at that guy?  Oh, Puck was so gross.  He kept picking his nose and putting his fingers in the peanut butter.  I am not someone dying from AIDS.  I am someone living with AIDS.  Is he still alive?  No, he died from AIDS.  No, he died from AIDS.  He died.  AIDS.  AIDS was the cause of death.  That was before they had, like, that magic cure that they got for.  The coroner didn't touch him, but just watched the season. 
[02:04:00]  That is it.  No, AIDS.  Pedro, AIDS.  Yeah.  I wasn't the peanut butter.  And they used to have, like, a lot of scary moments where they'd show him shaving, and  then they would slow-mo, like, if he nicked himself, they would actually slow-motion it,  like, ah, AIDS blood.  Yeah, yeah.  A cartoon of T-cells would start leaking out of his body.  Oh, yeah, just leaking out and oozing death down the sink.  When it fucking hit, it would do it, when it dripped, it would fucking make, like, the smoke, like, alien.  Yeah.  Fucking acid blood. 
[02:04:30]  It's gonna burn through the hole.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that shit is crazy.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, shit, you.  Remember when AIDS was the shit?  Yeah.  AIDS was a big thing.  Everybody would just be scared of it and talk about it.  Scared of AIDS?  Yeah, you wouldn't even ask someone when they were fucking, you'd just go, breed me.  Oh.  I remember that, like, being, you know, being scared not using a rubber.  I still didn't use one.  No.  But it was a lot more fearful.  I one time, I was like, do you have a condom?  My poor sexist guy.  And he was like, I don't got AIDS. 
[02:05:00]  And I was like, well, that's a good enough argument for me.  Yeah.  That's fine.  Right there.  And he was white, even though he said God.  He just wasn't educated.  Like, I like him.  White and uneducated.  Can you read?  No?  Come with me.  Do you have a type, Amy?  Do you have a type of guy?  Um, no.  No?  No.  Like, definitely, um, I definitely prefer that he speaks English.  Okay.  But, um, I don't think I have a type.  Yeah?  I guess, you know what, usually, that's not true.  I like kind of, I veered toward white kind of Catholic, kind of feeling guilty after having 
[02:05:30]  sex.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  If I were to have a type, if you lined everybody up, you'd be like, this, she likes the Irish  Catholic.  That, oh, okay.  And that they feel bad during and after sex.  Wow.  I like to be getting hit in the face with a guy's cross while he's making the mistake  of his life.  And you don't, uh, you don't have, like, a type, looks-wise?  Body type?  Do you have one?  No.  No.  No.  No.  I mean, I, like, I, in my mind, I'm like, I would want a guy, like, taller than me, 
[02:06:00]  just so I can feel like, like, a little lady.  Like the demure little, yeah.  The demure little lady, yes.  But I, yeah, like, because, yeah, I was dating a guy for a little bit and he was, like, really  strong and he would, like, he could kind of, like, ragdoll me, which has never, he would,  like, spin me like a globetrotter.  Wow.  And I was like, this is awesome because usually a guy will, you know, he'll try to-  You don't want to hear a guy move you and go, oh, God, what did you eat? 
[02:06:30]  Sweating.  Leg shaking.  Yeah.  No, but it's usually, it's usually not.  It's usually a guy where if I, if I wear heels, because I'm 5'7", that, uh, it kind  of, you know, will take away any masculinity from him.  Yeah.  Once that, once the top of the girl's head pokes over the top of yours while you're walking,  it just, all of a sudden you're changed.  Oh, I thought you were going to say over the elementary school fence.  That too, yes.  I love a girl taller than me.  You know, I, I want to date like a fucking, which it's easy to get.  That's okay.  But I want to date someone who's like fucking like, yeah, 5'11". 
[02:07:00]  Really?  Yeah.  But I, yeah, I don't like a masculine, I mean, a real feminine woman who's just taller than  me with a giant, long fucking lima bean ass cheek.  Yeah.  Oh, that too long of an ass thing.  Dude, there was a girl at fucking Florentine's wedding.  Her ass, it looked like two lima beans packed into a dress.  It was fucking, like the dress was so tight.  I could see a black line because it was, there were big globe ass cheeks.  It was a skid mark. 
[02:07:30]  Sexy Jill.  Oh, she has a little Manx cat tail sticking out.  It was a doody.  No, I like that fucking, you could see the dark separation where her cheeks were pushing  the dress.  It was so fucking sexy.  Do you like that hot?  The bride's mom.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I only saw it when she got up out of the wheelchair.  They were doing the chicken dance and she fell forward and chipped a tooth.  Is that?  Oh, shit.  You know how bad it must smell to eat an ass after it's been in a wheelchair all day? 
[02:08:00]  Oh, God.  That's terrible.  You know, you'd like to think you're open-minded about certain things.  It smells like a medical bag.  Wow.  I didn't know you were so judge male.  You'd like to think you're open-minded about certain things, but you gotta think that's  gotta be a little rank.  Ah, terrible.  A wheelchair asshole?  It's gotta be awful.  Especially if it's like legs that never move.  If it's just an injury they sustained, but if it's like, oh, still brand new shoes after  eight months, it was a little wear and tear.  Yeah, those tuxes didn't get no action. 
[02:08:30]  Because I've been told I have a complete type where people can just point it out in  a second.  Well, other than the fact that, you know, they have a diploma in their hand that they just  got from sixth grade.  No, I, you know, I understand.  If you want to see Anthony's type, look on the cover of Huggies.  Oh, my God.  That's the cover.  Yeah.  You have to cover the box top or something.  Damn it.  But no, no, I pretty much like, for the most part, like white trash. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  I'm a white trash kind of thing.  I like that whole hot look.  I'm not into any type of ethnic look at all.  I do just like pale, like trashy girls.  Maybe a swastika tattoo.  That can't hurt.  Well.  I like that.  Yeah.  I like when they know all that good Nazi lingo.  Yeah.  Things like that.  Um, and when we can just sit quietly and share mutual hatred of others, uh, and other races 
[02:09:30]  and people.  It is.  It's a nice evening at home.  I need somebody with a healthy, with some healthy racism under their belt.  I don't, I can't, I can't, I can't say something and have a guy be like, and I mean, as a joke,  of course, of course, of course, we all just joke.  And have a guy be like, whoa, any guy that I've ever dated that's been like, hey, I'm like,  oh, that's, that's it.  Goodbye.  I used to like having sex with just dumb, hot guys.  Just dumb.  Like, I couldn't even, I would never be able to talk, like, I would never get a meal with 
[02:10:00]  them.  Right.  Because it would just be like, what?  Just, how?  Just business and.  Yeah.  I'm not totally over that.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  That's like a guy liking to fuck a stripper, of course.  I mean, you can't not want to do that.  Like, you have to want to fuck.  So, sometimes who cares about conversations?  That's what the body looks like.  Yeah.  But that inane babble of a stripper is fucking, even in the club, when they start thinking  that they can talk to you because you threw them some money, and they start telling you  about their dumb lives.  Oh, God.  Oh, it's just, it's aggravating.  Stop.  Stop telling me about your family's struggles. 
[02:10:30]  I can't pretend to listen anymore.  The ones that they, they kind of squat down in front of you and grab one of their pieces  of tacky, shitty clothing and hide their breasts with it because they're not dancing now.  That's not.  They're talking with you.  Now I'm just mean.  So, now I'm just going to talk, and I'm like, really?  So, now I'm listening to you talk and not even able to look at your tits or anything,  and you're just, that boring, what she's going to do with her life, where she came from,  and, and that's years ago because those were at least American girls.  The Russian girls, like, I don't even know what they're talking about. 
[02:11:00]  Are they really Russian?  When, uh, yes, parents came from work factory, came here, uh, going to send for family, went,  shut up, shake your ass.  I came over season two of The Wire, and I, yeah, some friends not make it.  Yes, he ripped girl, and then they close up, and no one breathed good.  No one breathed good.  I can't stand that with, uh, with those fucking strippers. 
[02:11:30]  Strippers in the old days were a lot better.  Like, in, the local Long Island dives were great.  You walked in, all you needed was a few singles, and, uh, it wasn't this, you know, you want to dance?  It's, it's a local club, they try to make it like a gentleman's club.  The local shitty strip club, with the windows painted black so the kids can't see in when they're passing by. 
[02:12:00]  All of a sudden got this thing where they thought they'd panel off a room,  and now all these girls are going to drag you there for 20 bucks a clip to, to get a, a dance.  When they used to just walk on the bar, shove bottles in themselves, and you could throw them a buck.  Yeah.  That was fine.  Yeah.  Yeah, and it was just some Long Island trashy girl.  Yeah, please don't try and upsell me.  Your dressing room is an outhouse.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they all got this thing where it was like, oh, we can make this gentleman's club thing. 
[02:12:30]  Really?  Somebody had a big pitch at a meeting.  Oh, you know it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  One of the bikers talked to one of the fucking mafia guys.  See, it's better for girls, like, at least, I would just be so worried the whole time you're with a stripper,  like, just, that she's trying to get something from you.  With a guy, you know, he's just trying to fuck you.  Right.  You know?  Yeah, yeah.  There's got to be some kind of ulterior motive of money, or she's going to fucking rob you.  Yeah.  Or something.  Right.  Or, yeah, casing the joint for the guy that'll be there later.  Totally.  Yeah.  Strippers are just dangerous.  They're just desperate people. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  You don't want to fuck with them too much.  Yeah, they spend all day dancing naked, then they come over to your ear, you know, like,  I like a girl to dance like that naked.  I don't think you would.  Yeah, I would.  Who wouldn't?  Dance with that type of music?  Yeah.  Yeah, if I could put on a bathing suit that, like, it belongs in a poster in the Brooklyn  Diner, like a 1920s bathing suit, and just do, like, a really horrible fucking 20s.  An almost soft shoe.  Yeah, a little soft shoe for me.  Oh, God.  Spinning a parasol. 
[02:13:30]  Terrible.  Yeah.  All right.  Dave Mustaine, that's where we were going for a second.  Oh, yes.  Until we sidetracked his strippers.  He's born again now, I think, too, right?  Yeah.  They usually make a lot of sense.  Can I see him?  Yeah, and he doesn't like the president.  So I guess he had something to say at one of his shows.  Yeah, this is on stage.  I think it was in maybe Korea, possibly?  What?  Oh, it couldn't have been in the United States.  No, it was not in the United States.  Oh, I didn't realize that.  I don't think it was.  Is this stage fucking audio, or can we understand it? 
[02:14:00]  It's stage audio, but you can totally understand.  In Korea?  Do I look like him?  Let me see.  It's Amy Mustaine.  Oh, my God.  Damn it.  He's not smiling.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you.  Well, you both have beautiful golden locks.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  I don't know.  Now, aside from the shape of the face, I'd say no.  Oh, my God.  The jawline?  The Adam's apple?  Oh, God.  That is depressing.  I don't want to see him anymore.  Put him away.  Let's hear Dave Mustaine, what he had to say. 
[02:14:30]  It's a little weird.  Back in my country, my president...  He put his fingers down his throat.  ...gun ban.  So he's staging all of these murders, like the Fast and Furious thing down at the border  in Aurora, Colorado, all the people that were killed there.  And now, the beautiful people at the Sikh temple.  God. 
[02:15:00]  I was talking to J.D., our promoter here tonight.  What a great guy.  I was saying, you know, I don't know where I'm going to live if America keeps going the  way it's going, because it looks like it's turning into Nazi America.  And he said, move down here to Singapore.  I'm going to play a song.  I'll say this.  Where is the outrage over this, the way the Dixie Chicks got shit when they fucking bashed  Bush in England?  What he's saying is a lot worse. 
[02:15:30]  They were just saying they were embarrassed by Bush.  He's implying that the Fast and Furious thing with the fucking Mexican guns, I think was just  a fucked up operation.  I don't think that's the Obama administration.  I disagree.  I don't think they're trying to tie in fucking Mexican murders to show you how easy it is  to get guns.  He's tying that in.  But that's almost a legitimate point.  Yeah, the Fast and Furious thing is pretty legit.  I think you should wait a couple days, because this really just hit, like, last night.  Oh, okay.  But this fucking asshole implying that Obama's behind the Aurora.  What a douchebag. 
[02:16:00]  What a fucking douchebag Dave Mustaine is.  So he can, I guess, get some gun control in place.  That's what he wants to do.  So he's staging these things.  I don't know how.  I don't know how these politicians get these big conspiracy things going when they can't  do anything without everybody knowing exactly what their motives are.  But apparently he's connected to this guy that killed all these people in the theater  and the Sikh temple.  And Dave Mustaine knows about it.  And the guy who shot everybody in Aurora is just still alive and not saying anything. 
[02:16:30]  He's just being a good guy.  Well, of course.  I'm a patsy.  Yeah, he's keeping it under his hat.  Yeah.  That's what you do.  When the president has you put on an orange wig and shoot people or whatever, you keep  it under your hat.  You'll all laugh if Mustaine's plane goes down on his way back, right?  I probably would, yeah.  You'll be like, oh, well, I guess they wanted to silence him.  What a fucking douchebag.  People get confused when they have a lot of people in front of them.  Yes.  Like, we don't need your thoughts on this, Mustaine.  Yeah.  Thank you.  You're making the music worse. 
[02:17:00]  Sing your song that I don't know any of.  He's great.  Like, fucking, I don't love Megadeth.  I like them.  I'm not a massive fan.  But, like, you know, Symphony of the Struck, they have some amazing fucking riffs, man.  Yeah.  They're good.  But he shouldn't.  Shut up.  Shut the fuck up.  Yes.  His crap.  But you know what?  On the other hand, I'd rather hear something at least interesting like that than people  that just get up there and, you know, hey, you know, Obama's great, and fuck the Republican  Party.  Like, any time they spout out any politics, I tune right out. 
[02:17:30]  The Dixie Chicks got fucking slaughtered.  They were ruined.  They were ruined from making that Bush comment where they just said something nowhere near  as fucking...  It was a wacky time.  And they're based, too.  They have a different...  They have a country fucking base.  Absolutely.  Yeah, yeah.  They do.  But let's see what's...  Yeah, Mustaine, it's like, no one really cares about what he says.  A bunch of metalheads are like, whatever, dude.  Yeah, whatever.  I don't care.  Those country fucking people are like, what the fuck they say about George W. Bush? 
[02:18:00]  About our president.  We're at war.  We're at war.  You're supposed to be a president.  Right.  We're at war.  That's the same rules here.  We are at war.  Are we?  Yeah.  We're still at war.  I thought the war was over.  No.  We're still at war in Afghanistan.  No one pays attention to it anymore.  You're over the war.  Everyone's all bored with it.  Over it.  Meanwhile, Obama has fucking been...  Obama, no one has been fucking better in the Middle East than him.  I'm sorry.  Really?  Fucking...  Yeah.  God been lied and killed...  I keep saying he killed Al-Waulaki. 
[02:18:30]  I like the fact that he's fucking targeting people for drone strikes.  I just like his smile.  I mean, am I wrong?  Am I wrong?  I like that.  I love that he's doing that.  I think he's failing miserably with Egypt.  He's not really showing any gumption.  He's still kissing their ass as they're slowly turning that into another Iran or Iran.  He's leaving Syria alone, which he should.  Not our fucking problem.  Let them go to town.  Egypt's not our problem either. 
[02:19:00]  The Iranian and Israeli situation is a little weird.  None of our business.  It kind of is, though.  Let Israel handle it.  Well, it...  I think we should probably show a little more support for the side that doesn't want to have  a nuclear bomb dropped on them.  You know what, though?  Even that, I'm tired of supporting, and I'm tired of the whole fucking situation over there.  Oh, an anti-Semite.  No, no.  I love...  I support the Israelis.  Both of you have done so much for Israel.  It's just great to hear. 
[02:19:30]  Thank you, Amy.  All of the 5Ks you've organized.  Shalom.  No, I support the Israelis, but enough already with that whole fucking disaster in the Middle  East.  I'm sick of it.  All of them.  I'm sick of the entire situation and us being held hostage here because of this whole...  Fuck all of them if they can't get along.  Israel is perfectly capable of taking...  They could kick the shit out of Iran, so let them do it.  I do believe so, yeah.  They're a much better military than the Iranians.  Yeah, I do.  I don't know.  I'm just thinking if Iran ever got any type of nuke, I think it would be quite a threat 
[02:20:00]  to us.  Maybe.  I think it would.  So let Kim Jong-un house them or Kim Jong-un.  Not quite as big a threat because they really depend on us for everything.  They have to keep crawling back every few years.  Hey, we started up our nuclear program again.  Really?  Give us a few billion and we'll stop it.  Wait, do they have them?  North Korea has nukes, right?  I think they do.  You guys look at me. 
[02:20:30]  I don't know.  Wait a minute.  I don't know.  Don't they say they do, but every time they do a test, it goes like 10 feet?  Oh, no, I think they have a program that they keep fucking with.  Yeah, but I don't think they have.  I think they're one of the nuclear nations.  Supposedly, Kim Jong-un is being awesome.  Yes.  Like, he's like being a super cool guy, going around with his wife.  People love him over there.  Yeah.  Are you being sarcastic on that?  No, I'm being serious.  Yeah.  Well, maybe he knows that.  He's being totally different than his dad.  His nation is terrible.  Yeah, right. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, they can't.  They just can't figure that thing out.  That whole communism thing is a little...  I think he's being so great just because he hasn't made some weird video or organized  a crazy event like his insane dad.  Like his crazy dad?  Yeah.  And have people...  Sure he did.  There was video of some event that he had all these Disney Winnie the Pooh characters just  dressed up dancing for him.  That's not crazy.  That's called a fucking birthday party.  Why did we get so judgmental in here?  He just wanted that and he got it. 
[02:21:30]  Do you not like Disney?  Oh, he loves Disney.  Do you like Disney?  Travis is a huge fan of Disney.  Oh, you fucking mo.  Disney's terrible.  Disney's the best.  He goes with his family and takes a little Riley.  Well, I understand that.  You have a daughter, but I mean...  Yeah, but he would go even before.  Oh, yeah.  What would you do with the mouse?  I don't play with the mouse.  Who do you talk to at Disney?  What characters do you like? 
[02:22:00]  Who's your favorite Disney character?  I don't go to...  I don't like Disney because I get to go to Disney and wait in line to meet characters.  Jimmy's thinking...  Jimmy is only thinking like Magic Kingdom.  You're aware that there's rides, correct?  He thinks Magic Kingdom.  You walk around and like the waving.  Yeah, you don't just go from one pavilion to the other meeting...  But you do like that.  You probably like Goofy and Minnie.  Shut up.  You do.  Be real about it.  Who's your favorite character?  Tell us.  Which one is your favorite?  Mickey.  Do you like the Little Mermaid?  Mickey?  You actually like Mickey Mouse?  Why not?  Because he stinks.  That's why.  Mickey stinks.  Mickey's got nothing going on and you know it. 
[02:22:30]  He's not funny.  He's not cute.  He doesn't do anything.  Here he's at the wizard hat.  Stupid.  Eat my ass.  Okay, well when he has a wizard hat on, that's when it's pretty great.  That's true.  That's kind of the only time.  Hey, why is Mickey on that cross on fire?  Oh no.  Look, he's bullying Goofy's hands.  Goofy gets no heat.  Burning and then he goes, oh, Tigger.  Oh, sorry.  I did enjoy going to Disney a few times. 
[02:23:00]  Everyone loves going to Disney.  Yeah, I love going to Disney.  Sam loves going to Disney.  Eric loves going to Disney.  Of course he does.  I wouldn't know.  I like going to Epcot.  Yeah, it's fun.  No, I know.  It's not just meeting characters.  No, for what?  Jess and me will take you to Disney World.  Have a great time.  Have fun.  You want to come with us?  Never.  Why?  For what?  What am I going to do there?  First of all, he's not allowed there.  Oh.  Yeah, I was showing.  Hey, how come they only got four fingers?  What about this one?  Oh, Uncle Paul. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  Why, Uncle Paul?  Give me a room.  Uncle Goofy.  It's the happiest place on earth.  I'll say it is.  Oh.  Sure.  This ride would fucking kill me, though.  Just fucking, it's a small ride.  You know how many times I had to go on this?  Oh, no.  Really?  None.  You're a man.  I have a daughter.  Take the white, take her on.  Did they stand there?  Look at pussy.  Pull up her up.  Bring her to Auschwitz.  No.  Exact same ride you've been on.  Yeah, I went on this back, wow. 
[02:24:00]  This thing can do my child of the 80s thing very well, but I was a very, very small child.  World's Fair?  When Walt Disney built the It's a Small World ride.  What?  At the World's Fair here in New York.  I thought the ride just always existed.  I didn't even know it was built.  It actually was built in there, and they disassembled it and moved it to California to Disneyland there.  It was created for the World's Fair.  But it was created for the World's Fair. 
[02:24:30]  Wow.  Yeah, it was at the World's Fair.  You went on the original one.  Was that like the 30s?  You know where they got the globe over there?  Yeah.  Is it not the 30s one?  I didn't know.  I don't know the dates.  Oh, wow.  I think it was 64, I think.  And when did you influence Mr. Disney's politics?  And I do remember a stroller I was in that had like, it was shaped like a car.  It had a steering wheel.  I wasn't pushing it.  I was in it.  He can't get too much.  No, where was my girlfriend?  I wasn't.  I swear.  We went to the Goodrich Pavilion. 
[02:25:00]  And I do remember going into It's a Small World.  And my dad was talking about it years later.  And he said, yeah, I took him into the small world.  And yeah, he started crying.  And I was like, oh.  I go, why?  Why was I crying?  Because you hate other cultures.  Yeah.  I hated looking at all those foreigners.  And my dad apparently thought it was because I thought it was so beautiful. 
[02:25:30]  Oh.  That's cute.  That's gross.  He hated the fact that I cried at the drop of a hat.  He had to think it was something.  That's what he started making you fuck farmhands.  That wasn't just me being a little faggot.  Yes.  He had to think like, oh, it's probably some emotional thing like that.  Instead of just thinking I was scared.  You were.  It was dark.  I was just scared.  I was on the water.  All the robots were waving at you.  Oh, I was a scary cat.  You were overwhelmed by the beauty.  No.  Of what?  Those little round-headed things that they just stuck different eyes and hats on to try 
[02:26:00]  to make them look.  Maybe you didn't go where you thought you were.  Hank, Hank, Hank.  Yeah, right.  Exactly.  Then they take your pants off and take pictures of you.  I think you're mixing too much.  It's a small hole.  Terrible.  I don't want to be there.  Oh, poor little Anthony.  There it is.  The Walt Disney It's a Small World Ride at the Pepsi-Cola Pavilion.  None of that looks familiar, does it?  Looking back in hindsight, you realize they were just showing you Disney cartoons while 
[02:26:30]  they raped and photographed you.  There was a rape camp.  It wasn't a stroller.  It was a wheelchair.  Oh, my God.  I thought it was the World's Fair.  Yeah.  And then they made you smoke those little funny cigars with the little tooting bags on  the end.  Wait a minute.  It's like Pinocchio, kid.  Pinocchio's nose.  Yeah.  Come on.  I had a Pinocchio nose in my mouth and one in my bottom and one in each hand.  Somebody's not telling the truth.  Somebody's mixing up memories.  Somebody was repeatedly raped and thought he was at Disney World. 
[02:27:00]  Somebody was sexually brutalized by men of many different cultures.  I swear I was in Queens at the World's Fair.  This song was on repeat.  It sounds like a little rape victim to me.  Oh, man.  No, I swear.  I remember.  Kind of.  Was I three?  Oh, God.  That's a long fucking time ago.  Yeah.  The damage was done early.  Sure was.  Oh, man. 
[02:27:30]  You know, when I drive home, I drive past the World's Fair grounds and you see the globe  is there.  Where is that?  You remember driving past it?  Right by where Shea State was.  Yeah, the big unisphere and stuff.  It doesn't really look like that anymore.  No.  Look how great it looked back then.  That looked amazing.  Now it's just all broken down and creepy.  Yeah, it is very creepy.  Apparently, people have gone in there and taken some pretty cool pictures of how fucked up  everything is and broken down.  But it would be a good thing to kind of explore without getting, you know, raped. 
[02:28:00]  Can you walk up to it?  I think you can walk up to that.  The big globe.  The big globe.  And then they got those towers that are there with the observation decks.  Those two big towers that you see on the side of the expressway.  They're used in Men in Black for the UFOs.  Can you walk up to them or no?  I'm not even sure what you can get to there or not.  I'd have to roll that fucking thing all the way down the highway.  Look how nice to worry about the cars.  That's dangerous, Jimmy.  That would be fucking hilarious.  You know how white that World's Fair was, too?  Oh, my God. 
[02:28:30]  It looks pretty white.  Look how white everybody is.  Until you showed up at Shea Stadium in the background.  Shea Stadium.  The brand new Shea Stadium in the background, folks.  Wow.  Now it's just all busted up.  What year is that?  64?  64.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I used to like Disney, though.  And then I went to Disney.  You still like Disney.  Well, I do.  Yes.  I'm going to admit, I do.  I went to Disneyland, which isn't that good because it's just like the Magic Kingdom pretty  much.  And I went there with my grandma when I was a kid.  And she didn't even understand that the submarine ride didn't really go underwater. 
[02:29:00]  20,000 leagues?  20,000 leagues under the sea.  She thought it was Das Boot.  You'd get in this thing, and it would go around, and there'd be these little waterfalls.  You wouldn't see them because you're inside, but the waterfalls would bubble the water up  around you, and then you'd be in like this tunnel thing, and it would be dark, so they  would say, oh, we are now 20,000 leagues under the sea. 
[02:29:30]  And there'd be these horrible plastic fish that you could see there just anchored down  with fishing line, and they're in the water just getting fucking blown around.  It really stunk.  Your grandma thought it was real?  Yeah, and she thought we were really under it.  Either that or she was trying to bullshit me.  She's probably trying to bullshit you.  No, she was pretty stupid.  She sounds like a fucking idiot.  She was really fucking stupid.  I'll be completely honest with you.  Blithering moron.  She was a dope.  That's when they went with the Captain Nemo subs, but originally they went with like Cold 
[02:30:00]  War fucking American nuclear submarines.  Yeah, this does not look fun at all.  No, it stunk.  I loved it when I was a kid.  Did you?  Of course you did.  It was my favorite ever.  You liked that ride?  Yeah.  But I also thought we were probably definitely underwater.  You didn't realize there was a big scam you were going to?  No, I didn't know nothing.  It was kind of fun to look out the window and imagine you were underwater.  I thought there was an octopus down there.  But I mean, when did they tell you that you were going underwater?  Well, it feels like the submarine is going under.  But then you can get, if you look at it, like, you can watch the ride happening from the 
[02:30:30]  outside when other people are on it.  And you chose not to put two and two together.  Yeah, you can see the submarine.  Like, the pool itself is only seven feet deep.  If you looked out the window, if you went out and put your face against the window and  looked up, you would see the surface.  Yeah, it was clearly there.  Yeah, 20, what the fuck's a league, first of all?  That's 20,000 what, inches?  What is a league?  It's still a pretty amazing ride.  You guys are like, grow up.  A league, 20,000 leagues under the sea is much deeper than even the oceans are.  They made a mistake when they named it that. 
[02:31:00]  Because a league is very deep.  How deep is a league?  Six feet?  Is a league six feet?  So 120,000 feet.  20,000 times six feet is a lot of feet.  120,000.  120,000 feet under the sea?  I got seven.  How many?  I got carry the five.  I used my phone calculator.  Five into 120,000 is...  I'm doing a...  A league.  You said 50 miles.  Yeah, you could do that.  Oh, that's so cool.  20,000, 50 miles?  The definition of league was cool. 
[02:31:30]  What's that?  It's a measure of distance, and it was how far a German soldier could march during the  day.  Oh, a Roman soldier.  A Roman war helmet.  It's a distance a group of Roman soldiers could march in one day, possibly close to 50 miles.  Oh.  Oh, that's one league?  I thought it was six feet.  That's one league.  Oh, maybe that's a fathom.  I can't fathom how wrong you just were.  I can't fathom what a league is.  You were off by 49 miles and almost up to six feet. 
[02:32:00]  I've never heard anybody more off about anything.  I confused it with a fathom.  Yeah, you sure did.  The moon's 30 feet from here.  Oh, shit.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, a fathom is six feet.  Yeah, okay.  I mixed up my leagues and my fathoms.  Oh, it gets the best of us.  It does.  I know it.  I know it.  Yeah.  I mean, I've never actually said I can't league.  Why you'd say that?  Go to break.  No, go to break.  Yeah, fuck it.  Go to break.  I would be able to control the boner if this was more like expected to happen, but I didn't 
[02:32:30]  expect you'd be here in studio.  What an adorable little boner.  This is a lovely surprise that I am very thankful for.  Oh, I love surprises.  This is a lovely gift.  It feels like Christmas already.  Oh, you're Christmas all over my chest.  I'm just trying to look at her.  At the same time, I'm trying to control the boner here. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, Bobo.  I'm trying to control the boner here.  Oh, it's so cute.  I'm trying to control the boner here.  Oh, pretend I'm your brother.  I'm trying to control the boner here.  I'm trying to control the boner here.  Your tweets excite me.  I'm trying to control the boner here.  I'm trying to control the boner here 
[02:33:30]  Control the boner  Control the boner  Control the boner  Control the boner  Control the bummer, bummer, bummer, control the bummer.  Sirius XM.  It's the O.P. Reddition. 
[02:34:00]  Whoa, heavy duty.  Can I bring us back, Ant?  Please.  We're back on the radio.  Oh, I like that.  It's a good rejoiner.  Yeah.  They call it a rejoiner.  It's the O.P. and Anthony program.  O.P. is out with medical issues.  Yeah, he had a problem with his scrotum.  Oh, no. 
[02:34:30]  He had a skin tag on it, and it was rubbing against his leg.  Is Rob Cordray here or no?  Not yet.  Did I say it right this time?  No.  No, you didn't.  Cordray.  I keep talking.  Cordray.  I wonder who you're going to say.  Yeah.  Cordray.  Rob Cordray.  Cordray, I'm sorry.  A couple of quick plugs.  First and foremost, Amy's special, Mostly Sex Stuff, is a one-hour special on Comedy Central,  11 o'clock this Saturday.  Amy's fucking hilarious, as everybody knows.  But no, I've seen the set because we've worked together so many times, and it's just fucking 
[02:35:00]  great.  And this weekend, you can see her at the Hartford Funny Bone in Connecticut.  Just go to FunnyBoneCentral.com.  Funny Bone Central.  What a clever website.  It really is.  Yes.  And if you have nothing else to do, next Saturday, August 25th, me and David Tell are working  in Hampton Beach, New Hampshire, at the casino.  And then Thursday, September 13th through 15th, I'm alone at the Irvine Improv.  Ooh.  Ooh, Jimmy.  Enough with the whore plugs.  No, it's not whore plugs.  For myself.  I mean, Amy's a guest, so she should get her stuff plugged. 
[02:35:30]  Yes, she should.  This whore wants to get plugged.  What a great response we got from that Louis C.K. thing that we all had so much fun doing.  Oh, yeah.  You were the little, the hole, as they call it.  That was so fun.  I thought it played really well on the show.  It really did, yeah.  But now, have you done press on the road since then?  All morning radio shows hate all of us.  Do you know that?  Because that's exactly what it is.  I went, I did a show, I did Irvine last weekend, and I went and did radio.  And I walk in, there was kind of a weird vibe.  They're all just kind of, and the girl, their hole. 
[02:36:00]  Especially, it was like, really?  She's like, you know, we don't all, we don't all sound like that.  Yes, you do.  Shut up.  Yeah, and then they did it.  Then they did the whole thing.  The fact that you feel the need to defend that and say that, then you are the person  we're talking about, dummy.  Or else you wouldn't want to defend it.  Can I have a piece of extra that looks really good?  You don't want your weird, medicinal-looking gum?  No, I just chew that because there's no aspartame.  When you ask Jimmy for gum, it's a nightmare. 
[02:36:30]  Dude, I like regular gum, but I quit smoking, I became so addicted to it.  But the reality is, I have a long story, so settle in.  But I told you, Patrice got me started on this fucking aspartame kit, because he would  always talk about my Diet Coke.  Oh, yeah, that worked out well.  Well, all right.  He didn't particularly.  But still, it's the aspartame didn't kill him.  His health coach.  How do you know?  I hope it didn't.  I hope so, too.  His lack of aspartame killed him.  Oh, my God.  But it was the aspartame that fucking was...  So I chew so much gum, so I just try all this fucking vegan stuff. 
[02:37:00]  And this is all, like, vegan stuff.  Some of it's good, some of it's terrible.  Vegan gum.  But it's all...  Anything vegan doesn't conjure up these feelings that it's going to be good.  Shut it in down.  Shut it in down.  Look at that funny, funny guy.  I just watched it last night.  I loved it.  It was fucking great.  Louis' face.  His disgusted face when he changes ears with the phone.  It was like, yeah, yeah. 
[02:37:30]  And he's just, oh, God, I've got to deal with these idiots.  I like him doing the bare minimum.  Like, wouldn't want to be that guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just not giving any effort to...  Wouldn't want to be that guy.  And they're all laughing at it.  Louis Sika.  I say that.  It's on us.  And the girl host that thinks everyone wants to fuck her.  Louis.  It's me.  That was it.  Oh, no.  Hey.  Oh, Jesus.  Terrible.  It was a perfect depiction of shit radio.  That was fun.  It's like this show.  We all were real ready to do that. 
[02:38:00]  I know, right?  We really had researched our roles over the years.  Zero prep.  Didn't take anything.  Right into it.  So, wait a minute.  So, you did Irvine.  I'm doing that in a few weeks.  So, that morning radio is a little uncomfortable with that portrayal?  Yes.  Good.  What?  Good.  Good.  All radio should be.  Good.  It's a reflection on radio.  Sucks.  Yeah, I mean, like, radio hosts all heard about that, because you don't see that that often,  I guess, and they were not pleased.  Really effective.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy's gum is just... 
[02:38:30]  Be fresh gum.  Look, it's the Thomases of Maine of gum.  Yeah, most of it's not that great.  Be fresh gum.  This is Xyla Chew.  Xyla Chew?  That one looks especially disgusting.  What I'll do is I'll grab...  I only have, like, one or two pieces in each, so I just grab it.  I'll just grab a couple out of the drawer that have, like, one or two pieces in them.  Their website looks so medicinal.  This website looks so medicinal.  It's GMO free.  It looks borderline religious.  It really does.  It's not a gum website.  But it's good. 
[02:39:00]  100% Xylitol.  How do you know Xylitol isn't fucking horrible for you?  It's good for you.  Like, there's only one piece in it.  That's why I grab a couple packs.  Anyway, listen to the description.  Xylitol has a negative heat solution, and this causes a very pleasant cooling effect when it dissolves in the mouth.  Ew!  That sounds terrible.  Let's all chew some gum.  Yeah.  Let's all chew some gum.  Let's all have a chew.  Just all of us sitting around having a chew.  Oh, sure you want some gum. 
[02:39:30]  And this one's oral probiotic gum from Jaro Formula.  It tastes like Razzles.  I actually like that one.  They sell them in Whole Foods.  It looks like a child that's dying.  The names are terrible.  It's a little cancer kid's medicine.  Is there any gum in there?  No, it's empty.  Oh, I grabbed an empty pack.  Aw.  I didn't mean to.  Let me see.  Look at this.  There's a picture of sick kids.  Yay!  Oh, it's empty.  Oh, really?  It tastes like Razzles. 
[02:40:00]  Bald-headed kid chewing it.  And this tastes like black licorice.  Try a piece.  I don't like black licorice.  Just try one piece.  Good girl.  I don't want to.  I don't want to.  Try and spit it out.  Come on.  Ew.  Try it.  I'm not trying it.  Come on.  Someone try my gum.  Not me.  It's gum.  All right, let's have a chew.  Come on, you little cutie.  I'm going to have a chew.  I'm going to have a chew.  I'm going to have a nice chew.  Sitting around having a chew.  That's pretty funny.  Tastes like black licorice.  Do you like it?  And it lasts longer.  It tastes like the middle of a good and plenty. 
[02:40:30]  I don't like those.  I hate them.  Oh, flavor's gone.  And I don't like Razzles.  There it is.  No, it's gone.  Yes, it is.  My fucking gum.  Be fresh spearmint.  I'm still full of flavor right now.  Yo, be fresh, yo.  And Razzles are gross.  Those are the things that crumble in your mouth and they assemble back together.  Yeah, they were like, it's a gum, it's a candy.  That was their pitch years ago.  But yeah, it breaks apart.  And then much like the Terminator 2 villain comes back together again.  Yeah. 
[02:41:00]  I swear to you, the flavor's gone.  It's completely gone now.  I was chewing it for maybe 20 seconds.  How long do you want gum to last?  An hour.  From now to fucking L.A. in a plane?  Yes.  You've got to go to Chinatown and get some good gum.  No, this is good.  I ordered this stuff online.  It's expensive.  But I'm telling you, it's so much better for you than this fucking...  I like extra occasionally, but this is so much better for you than extra.  It's bad for you.  Can I hear this?  It's this Seinfeld where the guy gets the gum.  Oh, Lloyd.  Lloyd Braun and the gum. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, the gum.  Yeah.  Let's all enjoy a chew, huh?  I love it.  All enjoy a chew.  This is what the holidays are all about.  Three buddies sitting around chewing gum.  This might have been brilliant.  I love that.  So, you know, Lloyd, he thinks he can get more of this.  Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow.  So he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to.  That gum is terrible. 
[02:42:00]  Ah-ha, you missed the garbage can.  Ah-ha.  You didn't like it?  It's terrible.  It looks tiny.  Look how little they're going.  Well, I will say, that's why you've got to take it.  It's this tiny thing that you put between your front teeth and go...  Because it's not like a...  It's sugar-free chewing gum.  It does not promote tooth decay.  I like to have two good pieces of Xyla Chew.  Xyla Chew.  Oh, my God.  You need to get an endorsement deal.  It's Xyla Chew.  I hope you get sponsored by Xyla Chew.  Let's all have a chew. 
[02:42:30]  A chew.  A chew.  Now, you know what I liked when I was growing up?  A nice, big, adult buddy.  Oh.  What's a big buddy?  A big buddy was a fucking thing of gum that was like...  It was like a marathon bar size big buddy.  Like a big fucking stick of gum.  Huge.  I think I remember those.  And I shoved the whole thing in my mouth.  So they made it illegal.  Yeah.  In fact, it had red dye number five in it or something.  Oh, God.  Back in the good old days.  A big buddy. 
[02:43:00]  Big buddy.  I remember a big thing of gum.  Yeah.  Big buddies.  And then like an entire pack of Hubba Bubba.  I would just eat.  I would eat every piece.  Whoa, that's all gum?  There's a big buddy.  That's all gum.  Oh, my God.  And I would eat the whole thing.  I bet that was dangerous because kids would try to eat the whole thing.  Could choke on that motherfucker.  Yeah.  I wonder what happened.  And I liked that stupid powdery gum in the baseball cards.  Ooh, yeah.  That's good shit right there.  I liked Big League Chew.  Big League Chew was good because it felt like you were doing 
[02:43:30]  something got grown up.  Yeah.  Yes.  Bubble tape.  Bubble tape.  Bubble tape.  Bubble tape.  Yeah.  Good stuff right there.  That was a shit.  There's still plenty of flavor in this, by the way.  You have two pieces is the key.  What does that look at you?  It's only been like 30 seconds.  Wow.  I'm just saying.  I'm having a ball over here.  You know, Jim knows where you could get more of that.  Oh, God.  I do.  I order it by the case.  Do you?  Yeah, I do.  A case of gum.  Bubble tape was a fathom of gum.  Oh.  Hello.  Yes.  Wow.  It was.  It wasn't a league of gum.  That's a lot of gum.  That's so much more. 
[02:44:00]  The league of gum.  We're back at the league of gum.  Extraordinary bubble gum.  Welcome back to the league of gum.  Yeah.  That was.  Oh, yeah.  The baseball card gum was so good.  Yeah.  It would break apart.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  Nice and stale.  It really was terrible.  It was so hard.  Terrible.  It's like chewing a fingernail, but it was tasty.  Do you recall something called Turkish taffy?  Sure.  And you used to have to slam it on the counter and break it up into pieces because it was  in a little square. 
[02:44:30]  It was like a candy bar size.  Yeah, like that.  Holy shit.  Oh, wow.  And you'd have to smash it on a table to break it because it was impossible to bite off a  piece.  Oh, it would rip your teeth clean out of your gums.  Banana chocolate.  Vanilla.  And what's the second one?  Vanilla was great.  And banana was great.  Turkish taffy.  Turkish taffy.  Terrible fucking tree.  I would just tape that to my body and fly on a plane like it's hashish and then just  laugh when they find it.  They'd probably put that in your mouth and they sodomized you and have you bite it so 
[02:45:00]  you didn't bite your tongue off like a wallet.  Yeah, that's not screaming edible.  That looks disgusting.  I don't know.  I kind of liked that shit.  It looks like a grenade.  It looks like a weapon.  Yeah, it's shrapnel.  Exactly.  I liked shit like that, though.  Like old school candy.  A Charleston Chew.  Yeah, you always said you didn't like Charleston Chew.  I enjoyed a Charleston Chew.  I love a Charleston Chew.  They're the best.  Didn't like a Charleston Chew.  Do they still make them?  Oh, yeah.  I liked a Marathon Bar. 
[02:45:30]  It's my favorite of all.  Fucking Marathon Bars ruled.  Those are great.  And then some of the cheaper candy that you get at the candy store.  Oh, my God.  It's amazing.  We just trashed regular radio and we're doing a break that everyone does.  Yes.  Yes.  You know, when I was a kid, I used to hate when they'd put razzles on them.  Let me tell you something.  How about those Nico wafers?  They kind of dry when you put them in your razzles.  Well, that's a good point.  Why don't you tell us about them?  That is a good point.  Yes, it is.  It really is.  Oh, I guess this is a photographer here for when Mr. Corddry comes in. 
[02:46:00]  What about, you know, come on.  Ms. Schumer's here.  Let's not do that to Ms. Schumer today.  We all know that I look like I have Crohn's.  Oh, stop it.  Today I look Crohn's-y.  You feel a little Crohn's-y today?  There's nothing you want to hear less than when you're about to eat a girl's pussy.  I have Crohn's.  Oh, no.  Good.  So you've been shitting all morning, haven't you?  Just stay away from that portion.  Stick to that one hole.  Yeah.  Stick to the front.  I hope she knows how to wipe. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, yeah.  You know, please.  Front to back, ladies.  Nothing turns you off.  Nothing wrecks an ass-eating like the word colitis.  Oh, fucking boo.  A good ass-eating.  Oh, man.  Can you try the, um...  Love it.  Yeah.  It's nice to think about in the morning.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It really is.  It wakes you up.  Oh, it certainly does.  Yeah.  Do you like when a girl eats your ass?  No.  Not at all.  I've never felt driven to do that, but I'm like, I wonder if guys are just like, please  eat my ass.  No, not at all. 
[02:47:00]  And I don't want it.  I don't want it done.  Well, that's where we part company.  But I will fucking, I will dig in like crazy.  I'll tell you an experience I had.  I was getting my ass eaten by a young lady and it felt wonderful.  Oh.  And she's like, I never did this.  My ass is clean.  Yes.  Like I was after a shower.  I know my ass is clean.  Yeah.  He's still like an urban chick.  Now, my ass is clean.  It's clean, mother fucker.  I'm kind.  And I was fucking, she was like a submissive, so she's fucking kneeling, eating my ass.  And I take my fucking, the back of my leg and I wrap it around the back of her head and 
[02:47:30]  I'm pushing her head into my ass to make her eat it more.  And she goes, I changed my mind.  Oh, no.  Shit.  She did?  Yeah.  She just got weirded out by my foot pressing her.  Oh, wow.  Too bad.  No shit.  You're spurring her like a horse.  What are you doing?  Ah, big deal.  Big deal.  Don't fucking get in there.  She didn't know you used your feet as hands.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Exactly.  What are you going to do?  That's like fucking, they say, the coach says, all right, go on in there and run a play. 
[02:48:00]  And you go, I can't.  I'm going to get mud on my uniform.  Don't fucking say you're ready to run the play.  There's a couple differences in the two stories.  Yeah.  That's so fucked up.  And her mouth was wet from licking.  Yeah.  Did you feel all like that?  No.  No.  I know it wasn't.  I knew it wasn't an issue of being unclean because I had showered before she could.  She just got scared of the whole thing.  It freaked her out.  I was more annoyed than I was.  I wasn't angry.  I bet you were annoyed.  Yeah.  I was like, what the fuck are you doing?  Get in there.  She thought she'd have to live there.  Yeah.  What's that?  She thought she'd have to stay there forever.  Oh, man.  What if he never lets go? 
[02:48:30]  And this is how I die.  Exactly.  Yeah.  With that foot, it's dug into the back of my head.  You know, like my callus pushing your fucking, pushing the back of your skull.  That's pretty bad.  It's like, his hands are up there.  He's not pushing my head.  I was twiddling my nipples.  His toes feel like tears.  Is he fucking eight-footing me?  Oh, no.  I was actually jerking off.  I was fucking, I was playing with my dick in her face.  She had lost my rod.  It just happens.  And I was just jerking off.  It just happens.  Yeah.  Oh, you are a degenerate.  I love it.  Yeah, but come on. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  What a beautiful angel.  You're right.  Hey, look.  I don't need my ass eaten.  I don't want it eaten.  I do.  And I shower regularly, but I just don't want it that.  But as far as going down and eating ass, I will fucking sit there.  I look like that guy in Alien, where it's just laying on the table with a fucking monster  on his face.  Love it.  I don't even have to breathe.  You got it.  I love guys like that.  You just have to, a guy that's not really that into either of those things, I just don't  have time.  I'm just like, get out of here.  Why would you?  I don't like how you were raised. 
[02:49:30]  I swear.  It's like I'm applying that true coat on the bottom of the cars.  Just protecting the undercarriage.  That is, see, very gentleman.  Oh, Rob Corddry might want to join this conversation.  Should I scoot over?  No, Travis.  You can see what Travis is.  Travis will just take a fucking hike.  I'm out of here.  That's what Travis will do.  Because all the useless information he's popping up on the entrant tubes.  Yeah, he could sit there.  You sit there.  You stay there.  You stay there.  I'd rather look at Amy.  Oh, you're going to see Rob. 
[02:50:00]  He's still a foot away.  Oh, there's Rob Corddry.  All right.  Come on in.  Take a seat.  Good to see you.  The beautiful Amy Schumer.  Do you know each other?  I'm in love with Amy Schumer.  Oh, stop it.  In love and it is real.  You're fucking hilarious.  What's up, Jim?  How are you?  Good to see you.  I'm in love with you, too.  Oh, thank you.  Is yours ass-eating story?  Is that what's your interest?  I've got a couple myself.  His story was no stranger to the ass.  Are you a fan?  Yeah, I like it.  Do you like getting it?  We were talking about, do you like it?  I like getting it done, too. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, that doesn't happen as much as the opposite.  Yeah.  No, it's not a one-for-one kind of thing.  It's definitely not.  Okay, now my turn.  Imagine a guy.  I'm up.  I'm up.  But then you just spread your cheeks with your hands angrily.  You dig your fingernails and spread them angrily.  Oh, my God, no.  So you like doing it?  I think sometimes after I've taken a shower and I just settle down sexily in bed and then  my wife comes in and she knows that I've showered. 
[02:51:00]  And she's like, oh, fuck.  Wow, I got a lot of work done in that shower.  Man, I really took a lot of time and I cleaned pretty thoroughly tonight.  That's an extra time.  Boy, all that nasty hair's gone.  You prop two pillows up and you put yourself over them on your stomach.  You're presenting like a baboon.  Presenting.  Presenting.  There are times, maybe not just ass-eating, but there are times you shower right before 
[02:51:30]  you go to bed and you do realize it is kind of a, hey, you know, I went through the effort.  I'm very showered at least.  That's not my head.  You know, your head's got to go down.  Give me a break.  Somewhere down there.  Yeah, yeah, something.  Let's not waste the shower, I do.  Give me a break.  Waste the shower, yeah.  You do it once a day.  What do you want?  You want an award?  I hate to think I could have just been all funky and come to bed.  I was going to phone it in the shower if I knew you weren't going to wake my asshole  to sleep.  Lull me to sleep like that.  And the best is if she doesn't eat your ass, then you walk in and get the razor with the 
[02:52:00]  hair matted to it.  Like, are you telling me I did this for nothing?  Ew.  This made me ill.  That is an invitation to the dance.  Quite disgusting.  But doing it is fucking hot.  I hate women that don't want their asses eaten.  A lot of women won't let you do it either.  What?  I've never met one that doesn't want it done.  Yeah, it feels like a warm bath.  Aww.  Thank you.  Get over here.  I'm so good. 
[02:52:30]  How sweet am I?  I feel like my wife is patient with it.  Yeah.  Really?  She allows it.  There are times when it's like, yeah, she's cool.  Oh, no.  But mostly she's just like, all right, this is his thing.  This is part of that weirdness of the better or worse thing that they mentioned at the  vows.  That's basically...  Yeah.  It could be way worse.  It really could.  That's her compromising, like just kind of watching the movie you want in a way.  Right. 
[02:53:00]  Exactly.  Wow.  Yeah, all right.  I won't walk out on it.  I'll watch Expendables 2.  I fucking love it.  You don't need to ask Sam or you do?  No, I don't.  Comment?  No.  Sam's the worst.  It just never happened.  It may.  I may acquire a taste.  It's tough to enter into it.  Acquire a taste.  It's tough when you haven't.  It's not scotch.  How long have you been with your...  Wait, you got married, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  How long have you been together?  He's got a beautiful wife.  Seven years.  Why don't you eat her ass, Sam?  It's tough to like start eating ass after seven years.  Because you're like, what happened?  You selfish son of a bitch.  Yeah. 
[02:53:30]  Very good.  Thank you.  But you don't think that it'd be like, oh, we should do something different.  No, don't talk about it.  Just do it.  And she'll be really surprised and excited or punch in the face.  Or she'll be very angry and go, where did you learn this?  Yeah.  Why haven't you done this up until now?  That is something you wonder in a relationship.  If it just all of a sudden something like that shows up.  You're like, what did you watch?  Who have you been talking to?  Is this because you're a new friend?  What radio show have you been doing?  The best thing if you did it and she went, why did you do that?  And he goes, it's just the first time it hasn't stunk. 
[02:54:00]  Jesus Christ.  Oh my God.  Wow.  No, I think at some point I will try it.  Oh.  Yeah.  I think she'd enjoy it.  You got to just go for it.  Give it a whirl.  You can't be tentative about it either.  Nobody wants to be tentative.  No.  No.  You got to do it like you're taking it from her.  No.  It's got to be like your first meal in a week.  Yeah.  Don't dip your toe in the pool, Sam.  No.  It's my end.  First.  Yeah.  Face first right in there.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  But you could tease it a little bit, but once you get in there, stay in there. 
[02:54:30]  Don't fucking eat her ass for a second and then come right back up and then she's going  to be freaked out.  Strange story.  And then go right to kissing her.  Don't do that.  Don't do that.  Oh my God.  Be cool.  Yeah.  Be cool.  Be cool.  Okay.  Yeah.  Be a team player.  Stay away from the tongue.  I mean, prop up your knees, but be cool.  What if she then said, like, whispered to you, like, I've always wanted to do that to  you.  Oh.  I would let her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's nothing wrong.  It doesn't feel bad.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  I would let her.  Just do it sexy. 
[02:55:00]  Like, get on your back and then just grab your ankles and pull your ankles.  Go for it.  Oh my God.  That's when you, no, you got to smack her in the face and go, and then you're going  to kiss our children with that mouth.  Something that'll ruin the mood very readily.  It was a test.  You failed.  It was a test.  You disgusting whore.  Just in case that scenario, then, I'm going to make sure I'm clean when I decide, okay,  I'm going to do it to her.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And that way, if she decides she wants to reciprocate, I'm covered. 
[02:55:30]  Very good.  I'm guessing she's not going to, though.  Okay.  I'm just going to put my money on.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I knew that.  That's my guess.  That's my guess.  His ass hair is tied up just like his hair on his head, too, by the way.  He's got to pull back, a little ponytail, rubber band, scrunchie.  I argued with a girlfriend one time because she wouldn't eat my ass.  Really?  It wasn't that she tried it and didn't like it.  She's on principle, thought it was beneath her.  That was a hilarious honeymoon in this episode, too.  Yeah.  And they were arguing.  Yeah, Mr. Marshall came in and I had my asshole open on his desk. 
[02:56:00]  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.  Do you really want a girl to do it when she's, like, totally not into it?  I only want her to do it when she's not into it.  There's the punishment element, perhaps.  Jimmy likes any sex except consensual.  No, but I mean, to me, it was, again, I'm completely confident that my ass is clean.  I know there's not even a fucking issue.  So I'm like, I eat yours.  But she wasn't like, she didn't like, I don't like eating ass.  She just thought, like, psychologically.  It was like a demeaning thing.  That, and it was like, well, I fucking, I fucking smell your feet, like, a lot. 
[02:56:30]  So.  Yeah, before I ever kissed her, I ate her ass.  That's the truth.  Oh, wow.  That's a true story.  Wow.  What a beautiful journey.  You are a master.  That's amazing.  How do you do that before you even kiss?  Well, she was asleep on her face.  That's funny.  That would be how it would work.  That's exactly it.  She woke up.  Excuse me?  Yeah, she was having a mini stroke.  We were waiting for the ambulance to arrive.  So I just gave.  She's tying her shoes.  I said, I'm going to do this just in case you die. 
[02:57:00]  I ate her ass and she remembered that.  That is not how you give CPR, Jimmy.  That's funny.  Oh, my God.  By the way, Rob, yes.  Rob is here.  What are you plugging, Rob?  Hey, good morning.  Rob, thank you for stepping right into this.  Children's Hospital is hilarious.  Oh, thank you very much.  Oh, my God.  It's Thursdays at midnight on Adult Swim on...  It says Adult Swim on Comedy Central.  It's Adult...  Does it say on Comedy Central?  Oh, I meant Cartoon Network.  Cartoon Network.  Everybody that types those things up, they're like, I'm pretty sure they mean Comedy Central.  Yeah, no.  But no, it's Adult Swim.  Yeah.  I thought it was on the network. 
[02:57:30]  Midnight.  Thursday night.  That's tonight, right?  Thursday night.  Hey, look at us.  Tonight at midnight.  Children's Hospital.  That's your stupid DVRs.  Yeah.  It's hilarious.  Thank you.  It's the darkest show I've ever heard.  She'll come on and do a thing.  Please.  I'd love to.  Awesome.  We've got Amy Schumer.  I'll take after a scale.  Thank you.  I don't know if we can afford that.  Okay, never mind.  And it's Malin Ackerman.  She was in...  She's so hot.  I love her.  Oh, my God.  She was in Lucy Kudrow's...  Oh, The Comeback.  The Comeback.  She was amazing on that.  That show was really good, yeah. 
[02:58:00]  I didn't...  She was like the hot girl Juno, right?  She played the girl.  The most liked girl.  That show was really funny and uncomfortable and just...  Oh, I love that show.  Cringeworthy, yeah.  How about not get a season two?  Are you here to plug The Comeback, which is canceled?  I am so much.  The Comeback, which doesn't exist.  We just plug canceled shows.  That's great.  On Comedy Central.  Yes.  You know, Super Train was a great program.  Super Train.  You have some good people in it, too.  You get...  And Harry Winkler is in just tonight, or is he in the entire season?  No, he's in the whole...  He's a cast member, yeah.  He's been in for two seasons. 
[02:58:30]  That's great.  Yeah.  That's so funny.  He's the fucking Fonz.  He's the nicest man.  We've interviewed him.  He's the nicest man on earth.  He lives up to his reputation as a sterling human being.  Wow.  Yeah.  And it is kind of odd to see him on those reverse mortgage commercials, though.  You know?  You grow up.  He's the Fonz.  And then it's like, hey, I'm Henry Winkler for reverse mortgage.  You're like, oh.  Well, you know what?  I've seen his house.  I've been inside his house.  And we're not paying him enough for that house.  So let him do his thing, man.  Right, right.  He's the fucking Fonz.  You think he still has Fonz money coming in? 
[02:59:00]  Oh, he's got it, right?  I don't think that ever stops, right?  He was the biggest television star of all time.  Ever.  Ever.  Yes.  Like, nobody's topped that, right?  Fonz was huge.  Is there anybody bigger than the fucking Fonz, man?  No.  I don't think there's ever been a character like that.  He could still go anywhere in the world, and people would be like, hey, Fonzie.  That's true.  Was that Asian?  No, it's America, but the guy's constipated.  Oh, okay.  Gotcha.  Yeah.  He said he was doing arenas.  Like, he was doing, like, arena signings.  Remember when he told us?  He was in Detroit or whatever? 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, you're right.  He was probably the biggest ever.  He's, yeah.  As far as TV star goes, yeah, yeah.  And, again, he could just still go anywhere.  But do they have residual deals?  You hope that he had, like...  Probably not.  I don't know.  You hope he had a fucking piece of that.  I don't know.  I think that was, like, the heyday of residual deals, now that I think about it.  That was when they finally figured it all out, and actors were, like, actually making  a lot of money doing television.  Yeah, yeah.  So, you know, I think maybe, if anybody is getting it, they are.  I like that we just speculate.  Yeah, it's probably broke now.  Zero facts.  He's got nothing, and I base that on nothing. 
[03:00:00]  But did people who are in MASH, like, you know, like, did Larry Linville's estate get  a big piece?  Because he left after, like, season five, so, I don't know.  I bet no.  Yeah.  That's terrible.  Again, based on nothing but my own bullshit in my head.  Zero information.  Yep.  Zero.  But I got a microphone in front of me, so...  There you go.  ...people do listen to what I say.  Obama and guns!  Yeah, that's right.  Did you hear the one?  Yeah, so recently I've heard a report that Obama is actually going to people's houses 
[03:00:30]  and taking their guns away.  That's right.  That's right.  Yeah, he's pocketing them.  Same with one eye open.  Throwing them in the ocean.  You haven't been on yet, have you?  This is your first time here.  I've been here before.  Yeah.  Yeah.  On the radio.  Not the space radio.  Yeah.  The radio radio.  The regular...  It was.  Years and years ago.  Okay.  That was at...  Yeah.  All right.  Years ago.  At K-Rock.  At K-Rock.  Okay.  Yeah, Berbiglia was there.  Yeah, I thought so.  I was like...  Yeah.  Remember that?  No.  What was Berbiglia?  I sat far away on a couch.  Like, really far away from everybody.  Oh, you were on the couch.  I hated that fucking studio. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  I saw Mike recently.  I'm like, why don't you come back on?  Mike's funny on this show because he's just, like, caustic.  Yeah.  And he says awful shit like DeVos.  He tortured Boston Bob Kelly.  Really?  Yeah.  He's funny on the show.  But he's weird.  He's like, he doesn't want to come back.  He's a public radio guy now.  He's on, like, This American Life and shit.  Yeah, this is not NPR.  You guys know him.  No.  Wow.  He doesn't want This American Life to look down on him or something.  He doesn't want to discuss ass-eating, I guess.  He probably would have an interesting take on it.  I don't think Mike's an ass-eater.  An ass-eater?  No.  I don't think so. 
[03:01:30]  Mike is not an ass-eater.  Sleepwalkers don't eat ass.  No.  Oh, that's right.  Only by accident.  Only by accident.  They wake up eating ass.  He's like, he's having a sandwich.  Which I feel like I've done before.  Just fall right into it.  You come to, you have an asshole in your face.  Ah, what a dream.  Yeah, I, uh...  There is nothing better than this.  God, could you imagine, like, Howie Mandel trying to go on an ass?  You know, it's funny.  I met Howie's wife.  Yeah, yeah.  It just seems like a germaphobe would not like to do that.  Oh, I see. 
[03:02:00]  What's the equivalent of a fist bump for asses?  Yeah.  Like, ass-eating.  It's like, yeah.  What's the germaphobe's ass-eating?  I'll tell you what that is.  They lick their finger, and they rub it through the ass crack, and then they just put that  hand in their pocket for the rest of the night, so they can fucking pure out.  How does somebody like that even have sex?  I mean, even have missionary position sex with a condom on seems pretty, like, intense.  With his wife, it's different, I think.  I think we talked about that.  He's not skeeved out by her.  Well, then she knows that he does not cheat.  That is a guy that does not cheat on his wife.  Boy, that's a great gimmick, then, if you could kind of... 
[03:02:30]  It's almost like the prestige, you gotta live the fucking lie.  Live the act.  And then, yeah, live the act.  So you make like you're a germaphobe, she will never suspect you're cheating, and then  you just fuck every pig with herpes.  I'm gonna say not worth it.  I'm gonna say not worth it.  Not worth going around and doing all that shit you gotta do.  No, not worth...  Fist bumping is not worth anything.  To, like, be the fist bumper?  Nah.  What a tortured life that is, man.  Fucking...  Like, I'll shake once in a while, I'll shake... 
[03:03:00]  There was some comic in Montreal recently.  That we said hello to, who's fucking had clammy...  Oh, I know who he is.  ...awful fucking hands.  And imagine every...  And you're skeeved when you shake his hand, but imagine every hand you shake you feel  that way about.  Like, what a fucking horrible way to live.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Ooh, that hand.  Do you know what I mean?  That mitt, yes.  That fucking sweaty, awful mitt.  It's not their fault, they just sweat.  Fuck them, it's a hot and nervous hand.  I'm trying to get...  I'm really curious, so it's gotta be a real fat...  No.  No.  No.  Dirt, uh... 
[03:03:30]  Just a sweaty...  Just a sweaty...  No.  A prop comic.  Impressionist, nope.  No.  Guitar act.  Political shit.  Yeah.  Who do you want...  Builder.  Who do you want it to be?  You want it to be Builder.  That would be the funniest person.  I never saw the guy's act.  I didn't know him.  He was introduced to us.  We were sitting there and I was like...  He's funny.  Is he good?  But I don't want to work with him because I don't want to shake his hand.  People should know if they got clammy hands.  You just go, nah, you know, I don't do that.  I'm a clammy hand guy.  I'm a clammy hand guy.  I don't even like how... 
[03:04:00]  Like, when people come over and I've been drinking a beer and you got that cold, been  holding a beer hand.  Yeah.  And it's like, oh, and you're shaking such a little wet corpse hand.  I always gotta address it.  I'm like, ah, I've been having the beer.  Like, I go, ah, I've been...  And that's like all the time because I'm always drinking.  Oh, yeah.  I remember.  I'm always drinking, so...  Oh, yeah.  I used to give people that dead hand shake.  I forgot.  I did that for years.  Oh, yeah.  On purpose?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Terrible.  I would do it...  My hands are clean.  You want to shake my hand?  It's totally clean.  Absolutely not. 
[03:04:30]  Come on.  Hi.  How are you?  Ew!  He wouldn't do anything.  He'd just sit there.  Ew!  Dead hand.  It feels like it's really dead and you can control your elbow.  Yeah.  Ew!  That was bad.  That just felt really bad.  Yeah, it's just a dead hand.  I remember we were doing something in Boston years ago at this fucking...  At WBCN and I was getting my hands wet with water and shaking like all the fucking sponsor's  hands.  Like I had a clammy hand to see if any of them said anything.  He'd flick water into his palm and give him that dead handshake. 
[03:05:00]  That's hardcore like sabotaging your first impressions.  You know what I mean?  I will never forget it.  Yeah, you fucking horrible handshake guy.  Yeah, I love that.  I love giving an awful handshake to someone who expects a firm one.  Because you never forget it.  I see a person again and I'm like, oh, bad handshake.  I don't like you.  But here's how I shake hands regularly.  Like, honestly, I'll give it...  No, I don't believe you, Jimmy.  I'm not going to hurt you.  It's going to be gross again.  I'm not going to hurt you.  No.  No, I saw your finger move.  I saw the finger. 
[03:05:30]  I saw...  No, that's how I shake hands.  No, you got your finger ready.  I give regular hands.  I'm so grossed how I'm ready.  Oh, my God.  Squeeze.  Ew.  He's giving him a dead hand again.  Ew.  There's nothing better than dead handing someone.  That's horrible.  I'm like really skeeved right now.  Yeah, you should be.  It's terrible.  I don't know how he can skeeve you out like that with this thing.  Because there's something...  Well, do it.  Do it.  Give me...  Oh, your hand is...  But just grab it.  I hurt my hand, but...  Come on.  It's kind of better now.  Oh, yeah.  I don't like it at all.  Give me a real shake.  Give me a shake.  My hand's injured. 
[03:06:00]  Ew.  What happened to your hand?  Oh, I punched a chair.  Okay.  Yes.  It is looking slow.  So, a children's hospital.  Get a children's hospital.  I had to.  That looks like a fucking fat person's hand.  I know.  Look.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  It's swelled up.  What did the chair do?  It didn't make the dealer give me the cards I needed.  Oh, that's so awesome.  What casino were you at?  I was at the horseshoe.  Hammond, Indiana.  In Hammond, Indiana.  Yeah.  That fine establishment.  We were in Chicago, and I took a little trip around. 
[03:06:30]  And I was doing very well.  Well, poorly at first.  Then very, very well.  And then poorly.  And when I was ready to get up and just pay off my marker, I just got up and fucking  punched the chair.  And then I went up to pay off my marker.  And as they were writing the paperwork, I said, hold on.  I'll be right back.  And I grabbed the money off the counter, placed it on the table, and actually won.  Oh, you did it?  I know.  It never happens that way.  Yeah. 
[03:07:00]  I was pretty degenerate drunk that night, too.  Yeah.  And then right to the airport.  It was great.  That is great.  Well, he almost got kicked off the plane before he boarded.  The guy told me he smelled alcohol on my breath.  What?  I'm sorry.  Well, it was after he questioned me, because they were boarding people with health reasons  that need to board first.  So I did the stereotypical straight leg limp walk down the jetway.  And he was sitting in first class.  And he was on to me.  I was in first class anyway, so I wasn't doing it to board early. 
[03:07:30]  I was doing it for a laugh, because all these fucking idiots are hanging around.  I thought it'd be funny, but that airline industry just lost every bit of sense of humor.  People in the airline industry love jokes.  They are ready to have one.  I thought they would.  He started yelling down at you.  Oh, everybody's laughing.  Oh, it's real funny out here.  I'm not the guy to mess with.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who was it?  Biden?  Was he the guy?  I noticed your black dial and your black voice.  Was that Hillary doing that? 
[03:08:00]  That was Hillary.  Yeah, he was at 530 in the morning.  They don't want a boisterous drunkard trying to pull shenanigans on the jetway.  So, yeah, the guy yelled at me and then he threatened to take me off the plane, which  I hate that some clerk, some fucking guy that years ago had no power whatsoever at the airport  can now determine whether you get on or don't get on the plane.  I thought it was ultimately up to the pilot.  That's what it should be.  I really thought that was the best.  We're freeing. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, like I've seen people be like, okay, like the pilot's going to check out this guy.  Pilot's discretion, yeah.  I think you're right.  I mean, they're literally the captain of the ship and it's their call.  It's their call.  The guy at the front of the jetway that fucking sits there on his dumb computer all day,  he's the guy that's going to tell me.  I just am so sick of them being so angry.  It feels like such us versus them.  I'm like, you should give everyone the benefit of the doubt.  So you should be able to walk up and if you're not an asshole, they should just treat you  like a human being. 
[03:09:00]  Instead, it's this not looking at you, pretending like they're still, they're just trying to  buy themselves some time.  It's just the service industry.  Like that is, it is, it is a service industry job with a badge and it's that breeds that  kind of, you know what I hate is that I have a chip on my shoulder because I travel a lot  and when they're like, they'd go through that rote speech, like take your shoes off, put  your laptop in the bag.  If you don't have your laptop out of the bag, I'm going to stop you.  And they're singy-songing it.  Yeah.  Oh God.  Oh my God. 
[03:09:30]  I know.  I'm like, I know.  I've forgotten more about this shit than you will ever know.  They have like no training.  I thought one time, I might have said something here, but I by accident brought my bike lock.  It was in my backpack and it was just too much, it was too heavy and it could have been  used as a weapon, I guess.  And they were like, we have to throw this away.  And I was like, I was like, I wouldn't know how to use that as a weapon.  I was like, you would, because you're like trained how to, how to like stop somebody.  They were like, no, they were like, we're not trained.  They go, we're not trained how to stop anybody physically.  So how do you know what a weapon is? 
[03:10:00]  They know, they know nothing.  They know like what we know.  They do like an hour seminar.  They're like just teaching them to say, take your shoes off.  What's worse than when they try to be funny with people.  I hate when they Josh good naturedly with somebody in line.  I've never seen it.  Oh my God.  Well, it's the speeches usually.  Their speeches, sometimes they'll throw a little like, you know, bit in there.  And everyone avoids eye contact because they catch you looking at them, then they address  you.  You're the audience.  Oof.  Like you fucking horrible.  This is like Southwest, Southwest flight attendants, basically. 
[03:10:30]  Their whole rap, Southwest is like the funny airline.  Oh, look out.  Your seat can be used as a flotation device.  Kick paddle.  Kick paddle.  The first time I heard that, I was like, wow, this guy's funny.  No, wait.  No, no, no.  This is in the fucking book that they memorize.  Kick paddle.  Yeah, Southwest, stop trying to distract from you being an absolute greyhound.  Just give me my fucking $3 Coke.  Do you remember when Pan Am, this was after the Lockerbie, when they came back in the 90s, 
[03:11:00]  like it was a startup airline.  Somebody just bought the name.  Fucking Turkish planes.  And it was either that or Carnival Air, I flew once, and I was on there, I think with  Voss.  And the guy was going, the guy came out, the pilot came out, like they do now on Virgin  America, and was talking to the fucking people.  And he goes, ah, it's my first time doing this.  I hope it's okay.  He was joking, but it was so uncomfortable.  Oh, man.  That's really funny.  It was really frightening.  Why did they force him to be a stand-up? 
[03:11:30]  It's pretty much.  It's ridiculous.  Come on.  Yeah, I didn't like it at all.  No, get in there.  I want to peek in.  I want to see the guy with the nice grey hair and the suit and just fly the fucking plane.  I don't want Voss coming out.  Hi, I'll be taking you to your destination.  Yeah, all I want is to know when we're going to hit some hard chop.  Yeah, there you go.  And how much sooner we'll be at our destination.  How much time you made up.  That's it.  With that tailwind.  Yes.  No fun and games.  I love when they call it chop. 
[03:12:00]  Chop.  Don't you like that?  I love pilot lingo.  Yeah.  And it's always with the, it comes with the, uh, we've hit some pretty serious chop, uh,  we're going to be in Minneapolis about 14 minutes early.  It's comforting.  They got to do that on purpose.  They're the authority that you're our leader.  Yeah, because they know that, we know that sound.  It's just a soothing sound, like a cat purr.  It sounds like he doesn't give a shit.  He's like, this is so easy, what I'm doing.  It's not hard at all, and your lives are not in my hands.  Yeah.  It's like, I trust you. 
[03:12:30]  The altitude of, uh, 35,000 feet, if I feel like.  Yeah, we'll see.  That's all right.  We'll see what happens.  I've gone higher.  I mean, if you think about it, 35,000 feet, it's nearly fucking impossible what we're doing  right now.  Yeah.  As machines got to run it 100% the entire flight.  That these, that these things don't always crash is a miracle.  That's so fucking true.  That's frightening.  I wonder if they teach them that, or if that's just, they've all heard pilots talk now. 
[03:13:00]  Is it like, is it like mob guys who emulate the Godfather?  Is it this, like, self-fulfilling thing?  Or just a joke they're doing.  Like, they shut the mic up and look at each other.  How many hours did I get in?  I totally ummed them.  Yeah, I ummed them.  It's uncomfortable if they switch their intonation at all.  Like, if someone just talks a little higher, like, hey, folks.  You're like, oh, no, please do the captain lower tone.  Yeah.  That we're all used to.  Exactly.  Don't be a human being.  Yeah, please don't have any characteristics of your own.  Like, you never wanted to start, like, listen. 
[03:13:30]  Here's what's happening, okay?  Take a seat.  There's no way to spend this.  Yeah, there's no way to spend this.  Maybe that is a comfort thing.  It lulls you.  I think it is.  Maybe that's a conscious thing they do.  Folks.  I watched that goddamn air disaster show.  I try not to watch it, like, about a month out before I'm flying anywhere.  But it's, because you're always just thinking, oh, God, that could totally happen.  And the worst crashes of the ones where the pilots on the recorder, 
[03:14:00]  they listened to what he was saying, and it's everything you've heard right up to landing.  It's like, all right, flight crew, take your seats.  And it's like, oh, yeah.  They thought, like, all right, beyond the guard.  They're starting to think what they're going to do.  And then the thing just rolls over on its back and noses in.  Does that happen?  Yes.  Terrible.  They stay so calm.  Even the flight attendants, like, I don't know if it was, it might have been 9-11, but she was like, we're pretty low.  I think we're too low.  That was her name.  I think it was Wendy. 
[03:14:30]  Her name was Wendy.  I think she was calling in from flight, the Ata flight.  She was really still pretty calm.  Yeah, she was very calm.  I think we're coming in too low for LaGuardia, if I remember right.  But it does give you faith in them.  Yeah.  Like, when you hear how they are, even in a crisis, it's like, even when they're hijacked,  she maintained her fucking professionalism.  They're amazing.  They do that.  They really do.  But it makes you, like, when you're in awful turbulence, and you look, and they're still just stone-faced,  like, not acting like it's not affecting them, you're like, how are you not screaming? 
[03:15:00]  I stare at them, too.  I stare at them for any break in it.  They are the gauge.  I just want them to look at each other and just, with one little, like, twitch of an eye, go, holy shit.  They never do, though.  Never happens.  Never happens.  Wouldn't that get you a little, like, uh-oh?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They know.  They have so much power.  Imagine they were just like, oh, my God.  Like, everyone would go crazy.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  The door is open.  This has never happened.  Holy shit.  Is that a fire? 
[03:15:30]  No, fuck.  We're kidding.  We're the funny airline.  I actually like a little turbulence now.  I used to be so afraid of it.  I do, too.  But when I'm trying to sleep, I like it.  It's rocking.  It rocks you fucking nicely.  I used to be so scared of it.  I like it.  Yeah, they were a little chop, and they, like, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce.  It's very comforting.  Nothing like a little chop.  I like it like flack.  Like fucking anti-aircraft fire in a B-17.  Give me some of that, goddammit.  No, I don't mind it, but when it gets a little heavy, you start thinking, like, why? 
[03:16:00]  Where are you going?  How is this flying?  Why aren't the wings coming off?  All right, fucking scary.  Oh, Amy LaMotta has to fucking go and box, so.  Oh, you got your boxing.  I gotta go boxing.  All right.  Why do you not fuck your hands up doing it?  I do.  Are you boxing?  Look at my knuckles.  Oh, man.  Schumer.  I know.  Are you for real boxing?  Yeah, these are my gloves.  Oh, my God.  Let me see your gloves.  I'll let people hit you in the face, though.  This is the hottest thing I've ever seen in my life.  Are you going to get cauliflower ears?  No, I won't get cauliflower ears.  Oh, those are the real deal.  Like Little Rascals gloves. 
[03:16:30]  Big, big white ones.  It should be on an accordion.  Little Rascals gloves.  Oh, cool.  The grand brother.  That's nice.  Thank you.  Do you wrap your hands?  Yeah.  With what?  Wrap or gloves?  These wraps.  Wraps.  Oh, you know how to do that?  God.  Are you fighting people?  That's crazy.  I'm bound to.  I'm training to fight.  And you're not afraid to get punched?  I am.  Keith Robinson punched me in the gut.  Just at the talking.  The round was over.  The bell rang.  At the cellar.  I'm walking back to get water.  He punched me.  He sucker punched me in the gut. 
[03:17:00]  What a dick.  And he knows it.  I know.  And he's like,  I didn't hear the bell.  I'm like,  you're dead.  What do you do with your tits there?  My tits?  Yeah.  I carry them with me wherever I go.  Oh, cool.  I wear a sports bra.  Yeah, that works?  Yeah.  You haven't been punched in the tit?  A minimizer?  No.  I guess it looks like a minimizer.  I just heard that word.  That's why I did it.  I just heard that that's a thing.  I just recently heard that's a thing.  Sorry.  Yeah, a minimizer.  But she knew.  She's like, ooh, he brought those.  You know about minimizers?  Mr. Cordray.  Man, not really. 
[03:17:30]  Amy's one hour special,  mostly sex stuff,  11 o'clock this Saturday  on Comedy Central.  It will obviously repeat,  but try to catch it this Saturday  because it's better  if the premiere does very well.  And this weekend  at the Hartford Funny Bone  in Connecticut,  you can see Amy live.  Amy's very funny.  Thank you, guys.  And she's pretty pleasant  on the eyes  to look at up on stage.  Oh, my God.  I gotta tell you.  Today's Crohn's.  Oh, stop with your Crohn's look.  Thank you, guys.  And I love Children's Hospital.  Thank you, Amy.  I hope by the time  you do this gig,  you have a fucking tooth  knocked out from boxing. 
[03:18:00]  How great would that be?  Your support means the world.  That would be hilarious.  Oh, she's gotta wear  a flipper in her face  like those toddlers in Tiaras.  I want her to look like  the guy that fucking  Emil Griffin beat up  in the ring.  Remember that guy he killed?  Killed the guy in the ring  many years ago.  Here goes Amy.  Now she's awkward.  There's an empty seat  between Rob and I.  She's very attractive.  She's funny, though.  In love with her.  I'm weird,  but I'm weird with female comics.  I've only dated one in my life,  and I have a weird  non-sexual attraction for them  because their energy to me 
[03:18:30]  is funny,  and I associate  it's not a sexual energy to me.  Like, even Amy,  who I think is very hot,  I don't have a sexual energy  from her  because she just makes me laugh.  Like, she's very funny.  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah, disagree.  Oh, you like to?  Maybe I'm weird.  I love a funny chick, man.  You do, right?  Nothing's hotter to me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  If you could sit and watch  like some dumb fucking movie  or TV show  and just laugh at  and she's actually saying 
[03:19:00]  funny shit,  that's great.  I love it.  A chick that gets it?  Yep.  I love that as a friend.  Love it.  Best friends.  I do.  As a friend.  Best friends.  I do, but if I was...  Do you need to be  the funniest one, though?  No, not at all.  I didn't...  No, I don't mind...  I wouldn't pin you as that.  The dirtiness.  I don't associate that  with being dirty.  Like, I had a girl one time,  I was eating her pussy  and she goes,  that's a good doggie.  Oh, what?  It fucking turned me on  so much. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  But it was such a...  So you found out  there was a dog in the room  and she was  calling him over  and she thought  it was the dog.  Yeah, it was actually  a statement on my appearance.  I mean Jimmy.  I mean Jimmy.  She was looking  for a replacement.  Yeah, exactly.  Good fat-titted piggy.  Good fat-titted.  Good road middle.  Good road middle.  But it turned me on  so much.  It was such a deviant  fucking thing to do.  That energy turns me on.  I would laugh  at something like that.  I can't listen. 
[03:20:00]  I like some dirty talk  but it's gotta be  pretty normal dirty talk.  Really?  If you hear something like  oh doggy,  I would be like  really?  Woof!  Like I would just...  I'm with Jim  on this one.  I actually had a woman  say oh my god  Henry Winkler  was just on that  his one reverse mortgage.  Really is a good deal.  Of course it is.  Call now.  Call the Fonz.  1-800-something.  I had a woman  that was eating her pussy  say eat my pussy  you faggot. 
[03:20:30]  And it was so fucking  like in the...  It was like a punch  in the face for a second.  Like wait oh!  But then again  like so perverted  and degrading  and fucked up  that it was hot.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is...  It can be fucking  really hot when they...  I don't find it like  wow that's weird.  But it's not to say  that funny women  aren't sexy.  I just enjoy their energy  because I'm such a pig  that I love the fact  that I can be friends  with Amy  and I love Amy  but I love that 
[03:21:00]  I can enjoy her  for who she is.  And not feel  and not be always like  on her.  And not have  ulterior motives.  That's what I love  about my friendships  with female comedians.  On 4th of July  Because I love them.  On 4th of July  at our party  were you looking  at her in the bikini  in a sexual way  at all?  Yes and I looked  at her and I went  wow she looks great  wow her ass looks good  but it wasn't like  it doesn't make me click.  I could not stop  looking at it.  Like I...  It was terrible.  I'm just like  I need to look at her.  I am Facebook  Facebook friending her today  for the 4th of July. 
[03:21:30]  She looked great.  If I didn't know her  as a friend  and value her  as a friend so much  I'm weird like that.  I'm really weird  with female comics man.  I just...  I love their energy  and they're the only  women on earth  that I can just  truly enjoy  for who they are  without trying to fuck them.  Because they're not like  the normal fucking chicks  that are just like  ugh.  Because I don't see  the dirty side of them ever.  So if I met a female comic  and she had that  fucking for real  filthy energy  I could get into it  but I've never seen  that side of any of them.  I just don't...  That's so odd. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah it's a bizarre thing  but that's why...  But I guess that's like  you know if you were  you would be the perfect guy  to work in like  an office place  you would never have sex  with your co-workers.  Maybe it's that.  Just like you just  you shut down  with people that...  No waitresses?  No I would love to  just pull my dick out  and show a waitress.  No no it's not to do  with integrity.  It is simply  because they're funny.  Like if they make me laugh  so when someone's  making me laugh  I can't be  have a sexual vibe to it.  That's wild.  Yeah.  But a co-worker  oh yeah and a waitress  Maybe not at the same time. 
[03:22:30]  I don't like the idea  of yucking it up  in the fucking bedroom  but if a girl's funny  I think that's great  and then you go and  you know eat ass  and fucking pussy  and...  Well are you more  of a submissive  or a dominant guy?  Like I kind of go  back and forth.  Back and forth.  Yeah me too.  Yeah I've only  really realized  recently that I could  get into the submissive  you know side of it  though I don't think  my wife is too  she's not as a  I gotta work her 
[03:23:00]  Yeah  Work her up into that?  How long are you with her?  10 years.  10 years in a week?  Yeah.  Or no in a month.  Okay.  Sometime.  Sometime soon.  I really don't know.  You best get it right.  Her name's Sandy  or something.  Yeah.  So we'll work on that.  Just like  just give me a little  like just a smack  out of nowhere  here and there.  Wow.  Like to really  I like the surprise of it.  Yeah?  The fuck you  keep doing what you're doing.  That's fucking  I understand it 
[03:23:30]  but it's not me.  I don't know.  There's one girl I knew  who I fooled around with  and she would piss in my mouth  and she would  but the turn on of it was  it was the way  she climbed up  like we would be kissing  and she would climb up  and straddle my mouth  without asking me.  No warning.  Because she just knew  that she was going to  piss in my mouth  and it was such a sexy  absolutely dirty thing to do  with no regard  of whether or not 
[03:24:00]  I wanted her to do it  and that was  That's hot.  Yeah man.  It was the  I enjoyed her doing it too  but it was the feeling  of her fucking beautiful legs  around my face  and looking up  and just touching her  like it was all this weird shit.  The only bump for me  is the pee in the mouth.  That's the only bump.  That's a big one  for a lot of people.  Only bump in the road.  That is a tough one  to get over.  You're right.  That would be kind of hard to  but yeah  in the moment  great  and I like the whole idea  of her doing that  would be great  and then you know 
[03:24:30]  you start going down on her  but that was kind of over too  once you got a mouthful of pee  right like  what happens then?  You swallow it  and keep going.  Cool.  Far out.  Far fucking out.  You swallow it.  Oh yeah yeah.  I would go  you commit.  You just commit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  But that was  the sexy thing  was her  was her climbing up  and just being  so fucking perverse  man.  That is pretty perverse.  I'll give you that.  Yeah.  I don't know  because comics 
[03:25:00]  are always trying  to make you laugh.  Yeah.  Like female comedians  they want us  to respect them  as  you know  understandable.  Totally.  It's a male dominated business  so they have a hard fucking  Yeah.  So she's going to be like  crawl up on you  like she's going to  piss in your mouth  and like a party favorite  comes out  and everyone starts laughing  you lose your rock.  One of those snakes  Yeah yeah  snake can thing  comes out  or a pussy opens  and she throws her voice  and she sounds like  Gene Stapleton  I've dated comics  who like 
[03:25:30]  who I realized  right after a couple days  like they weren't funny  I was like  oh god I don't think  you're funny  and that was like  you know  I can only think of one  in particular  but like  yeah that was a bummer  and that was a total turn off  like done  Yeah once you find out  someone that you think  is funny isn't funny anymore  that would be a big turn off  They're telling us  Rob has to go  Oh man  Oh man  He's in the press  Rob is a very busy gentleman  Who do you have to do interviews with?

[03:30:30]  of the mornings  that everybody  looks forward to  Call us up  866-WOW1-WOW  And tell me  what did you learn  on today's show  We took one phone call  today  I did learn something  And that was from Bobo  Roland  Roland in here  with the first  What did you learn  of the day?  I learned you might  eat ass soon  Phrased like a true  gentleman Roland  Yes  Well I mean I did  I did speak on that  subject  I eat ass sometimes  You do?  At work when they  have to  Dicks in the ass 
[03:31:00]  You eat ass  after getting  a dick in the ass  Feels like it  They really run  you through the  ringer here  Yeah pretty much  Is today a tough day?  Nah it's alright  It's not as bad  as it has been  It's not a great day  I can't say that  No  No  Anything going on?  Yeah you know  Life  Life  It's like you look  at life  like hey look  there's life  and then it  takes a shit  in your face  like oh there it is  Gotcha  Just constantly  in that cave  and that little  hole of light  that you're reaching for  That's the butthole  It just keeps  getting further and further 
[03:31:30]  I'm trying to lick it  to get all the shit out  Right but somebody  keeps jamming a dick in it  Is that right?  Yeah  What's going on today?  You know  Problems with management?  No no no  Not today?  No they're awesome  Yeah well you're  rolling your eyes  so I take that  to be sarcastic  I can't roll my eyes  You can't physically?  Alright there I did  Oh there you go  So no is it  trouble or just meetings  or just the same  old bullshit?  You know just life  You got a lot on your plate  rolling dealing with  management  No management's good 
[03:32:00]  Dealing with publicists  Is it some publicists  that you have to deal with?  No I love them  Dealing with talent  and that comes both  from show hosts  and you know  the talent that  comes on as guests  They've been awesome  Just life  Sal Roland's having  a rough one today  Oh is it  your personal life?  Yeah  It is your personal life  Lady troubles?  Is that what it is?  No  No it couldn't be  lady troubles  When do ladies  ever give men trouble?  Never  Never  So it couldn't be that  Never  Could it?  No  No and you wouldn't  bring that to work 
[03:32:30]  with you anyway  You'd probably just say  Oh I leave my  personal life at home  I'm rolling  That's correct  Talent booker  extraordinaire  Yeah just send  emails out  hit send  and then you're like  give me a whiskey  You ever watch MTV?  I  Actually I saw  that your show  on JetBlue  What show?  The Friend Zone  Oh speak of the devil  It's a funny show  isn't it?  I  I literally  I got  when we were  on the tarmac  and it came on  I'm like  I'll just watch it  Sam talked about it 
[03:33:00]  Yeah  The first episode  I'm like  yeah  and then my second episode  when this guy  he was so scared  and she goes  you should take her to  this is my favorite restaurant  so he booked in that restaurant  she goes  oh I love it  when a guy wears this  and he went to the store  and bought that  and he did everything  and then at the end  he professed his love  and she goes  you're like my brother  Yeah  and then she goes  we'll always be friends  and she goes  yeah of course  and then it stops  and went to commercial  and then he goes  five months later 
[03:33:30]  still have not talked  to each other  I talked about this show  a little bit  It's the greatest thing ever  a little bit  when Jeff Dye  did the after show  and then more  on my Sunday show  which is 4pm Eastern  Oh he's back  with his new show  Who is?  Jeff Dye  He's got a new show  Yeah or the same show  but second season  That's a funny show too  but yeah  on the Sunday  by the way  this week  on the Sunday show  Cray Sean  is going to be on the show  YouTube Phenomenon  and rap star  Cray Sean  is going to be on  the Sam Roberts show  on Sunday  at 4pm Eastern  on this channel 
[03:34:00]  but I did  I talked about  the friend zone  on that  it's this MTV show  and it's just another  horrible MTV dating show  they've done 150 of them  you've seen most of them  but this one  is maybe the best show  on television  because the premise is  that it's a guy  and a girl  and they're best friends  but one of them  has had a crush  on the other one  for years  and so  the one  who has a crush  on the other one  so say the guy  has a crush  on the girl  right  so this guy  is saying  I have a blind date 
[03:34:30]  to set up  why don't I ask you  my best friend  to help me out with it  and then she helps him  out with it  and then at the end  of the episode  we find out  that the blind date  that he was setting up  was for the friend  that's been helping him  the whole time  and I thought  when I first started watching  that this was going  to be a terrible show  I thought that it was  just going to be  another show  where it has a happy ending  and they go  oh you like me  I like you too  we're so happy together  let's go on a date  it never  80% of the time  I'll say  90%  90% of the time 
[03:35:00]  it ends with  what  like my favorites  are always the  because we've all  been there  my favorites  are the ones  where they look  at their friend  and they go  are you kidding me  why wouldn't you  have told me  I had a crush  on you  three years ago  when we started  hanging out  but I've moved on  I'm not interested  anymore  and the guy  is just looking  at her  like  I was too nervous  three years ago  I'm telling you now  and she's like  yeah now it's not  going to happen buddy  now it's over  you missed your shot  my favorite  is when they 
[03:35:30]  walk away  the music they play  yeah  that's your life  huh Roland  at times  at times  it's like those  oh your podcast  with two girls  oh yeah  I had the girls  they wrote a book  called The Gaggle  they're funny  I mean they're good too  I don't even know  what that meant  you're just like  it's like  your podcast  it's your girls  Sal  did you learn  anything on today's show  I learned that  Honey Boo Boo  lives by the train track  that's right  she does  that was in the  6 o'clock hour  the beginning of the show 
[03:36:00]  she certainly does  and Eric  hello  did you learn  anything on the show  I learned a couple things  I learned that  white celebrities  changed their persona  around black interviewers  how perfect  was the example  of Chris Klein  on Who Kid Show  I knew eventually  that would come in handy  because I was sitting  in that room  Chris Klein from  American Pie  he's getting interviewed  by Who Kid  and Chris Klein  is just  he's talking  like he was raised  in Mississippi  or something  like he had this 
[03:36:30]  weird pseudo black  accent that just came  out of nowhere  because Who Kid  was talking to him  and all of a sudden  this is how he speaks  we heard him on  Chelsea Handler  it's just not how he speaks  it was funny  but I'm glad  that that was finally  able to be brought  to the show  did you learn  anything else Eric  I learned  Ant rode the original  It's a Small World  before it was at Disney  that's right  and that was at the  1932 World's Fair  will Eric eat ass  I don't know  if you ask him 
[03:37:00]  Eric eats a lot of stuff  Adam Richman  was in here yesterday  I know Eric  likes to eat sandwiches  I know Eric  likes to drink  coke floats  Eric  will you eat asshole  no that's not for me  you don't like that at all  I don't think  I would enjoy that at all  what if your wife  asked you to  I don't think  she would ever  ask me for that  do you think  has she ever  had it done  I don't know  I never asked her  what's so funny  Sal  Eric's face  is just so like  I don't know  is he embarrassed 
[03:37:30]  or is he angry  he's just got like  yeah he's turning  a little bit red  it's just awkward  he's embarrassed  at the point of conversation  well what if she said that  like  what if she said  I honestly don't know  how I'd react to that  yeah kind of that  throw some mayo in that hole  let's get going  she keeps herself clean  I'm sure  people do that  yes  I don't know  I don't think that's for me at all  would you let her do it to you  no  what about a little finger  no  have you seen what he does  in the morning  how would he want to do it  that's like a hazard zone 
[03:38:00]  the CDC  what about just a little finger  Roland  would you eat ass  you know  I eat a lot of shit  why not  Roland strikes me  as the type of guy  you would pretty much  just do whatever the girl says  I just say this  like well fine  you're submissive  whatever  you'll do whatever she says  Sal  you're a young guy  you eating ass  she's gotta be the right chick  you out there playing the field  eating that ass  it's gotta be the right chick  yeah  playing in the model a little bit  is she breathing  she's the right chick  yeah exactly  whereas you Roland  as long as she'll sleep with you 
[03:38:30]  if she wants that asshole eating  you're gonna do what you gotta do  is that right  yeah she's breathing  I'm in  have you done it before  me  yeah  never  you're waiting to  yeah  I'm waiting for the right girl  okay  for that sort of thing  Eric  are you waiting  I guess you're not waiting  for the right girl  you wouldn't do that to anybody  have you done it  no  no  and you just have no interest  in doing it  no  what about just like  a little finger  but not in  but just around  the balloon knot area  no 
[03:39:00]  like just to press  just to see  around mine  no way  stop being selfish  I'm talking about  I'm talking about  that you would do that  to your wife  just to see what  her reaction would be  what if you just did that  like what if you know  you were intimate  or if you're afraid  that she might go  I like it  no  what if she did  wouldn't that be a nice treat  no that's not for her  do you know that  I know for a fact  she doesn't want anything  or anything  nothing  nothing  no  not even a nose  to smell  no  nothing  nope  Sam's willing  I'm willing  I mean 
[03:39:30]  I feel like that's the duty  of a you know  it's a healthy relationship  it's healthier than chicken fingers  you guys are all probably  driving Troy crazy right now  because he's just sitting there  I mean  he's mad right now  that his tongue is not  in an asshole  Justin in New Mexico  whatever bro  hey what's up guys  how you doing  I'm doing great  you are  very eager to eat that ass  out here  that's what you learned  that's what I learned today  it's not that I'm eager  it's that I think that  you know  I could see that happening  before 
[03:40:00]  I mean  and hopefully before too long  I don't want to be  you know  sitting there  chomping away  on a 40 year old's asshole  I don't think so  you know what I mean  time is of the essence  so  Bubba in Texas  I would hope that  E-Rock's wife  would have a crash helmet on  and she attempts  to eat that ass  E-Rock  would your wife  need a crash helmet  if she ate your ass  no  not at all  how come you wouldn't  want her to  even press around back  why don't you go  let Sal go in there  and just touch your butthole  and see if you like it  no  why  because that's disgusting 
[03:40:30]  just if Sal's doing it  he's got very  let me see your hand  I have Purell here  he has a very dainty hand  yeah he's got a feminine hand  but they're Italian  like hey  manicotti  and he just pushes his finger  not in but just on your butthole  and then you can see  if that's something you enjoy  no  you don't even want to try it  no  I'm kind of insulted  that he doesn't even want me to try it  I don't let you try it on me  what the fuck's wrong with you  what do you mean  it's for the show  it's for the show  it's not for the show  it's self-exploration  E-Rock  it benefits all of us  it's not for the show  it's self-exploration though  it benefits you as a person  no 
[03:41:00]  it doesn't  it only causes problems  what do you mean  what kind of  why  because your wife would be mad  that your subordinate here  your associate producer  fingered your asshole at work  no  what type of problems  just it's  mental problems  it would leave you scarred  oh yeah  finger in the ass  of Dr. Steve  you did  yeah I'm fine  Roland got a finger in the ass  did you enjoy it  that's a doctor  well  so we think  we don't know  that's true  I have no confidence  that Dr. Steve is a real doctor  I love him  he's a great guy  that's confirmed  but I've never seen a medical license 
[03:41:30]  he stuck his finger right in my ass  like woo  plus I've seen a picture of him  when he was younger  and he had a weird  jerry curl haircut  that was a mullet  and a mustache  he didn't look like any doctor  I had seen  he's not like Royal Pains  I mean that's a doctor  did you enjoy  when Steve had his finger  in your butthole  eh I'm not complaining  no  no  why would you  Mike in Florida  what did you learn  I learned that  fat E-Rock  doesn't listen to the show  E-Rock you had some trouble  he had three cool rules  what does  penis wrinkle rules  oh I don't know  what penis wrinkle is 
[03:42:00]  but E-Rock  tough day today for you  nah I'm alright  well you're alright  but the show wasn't  you weren't listening again  I'm over it  what are you  you're taking a page  out of Opie's book  I did hear it though  it was  somebody did sound  very annoyed  do you think  you have problems  when it comes to  listening to the show  you get busted a lot  for not hearing  what's going on  time to time  yeah  do you think you have  problems with listening  to the show  no  you don't think that  he's on top  of the after show  I know what the problem  I know what the issue is  what's the issue 
[03:42:30]  is I'm reading other stuff  okay and why are you  reading other stuff  you get a little bored in there  it depends on what's going on  some topics on the show  just don't interest you  you gotta have a little  stimulation  no  I'm just reading  other things  why  cause I do  but don't you think  you could just  for you know  from 6 to 10  you could just say  okay  I'm gonna focus  on the show  you guys got me  or is that a little  too much to ask  no I usually do  that Eric  we've  on any given day 
[03:43:00]  you could be busted  at least once  for not listening  to the show  is that fair  I don't know  if that's fair  it happens  multiple times  per week  Rob's back there  shaking his head  yeah  bring Rob in here  bring Rob in here  is he screening the calls  or is Kevin  no it's Kevin  okay I'm gonna talk  to Kevin in a little bit  too  cause I wanna  check the status  on his career  but yeah  bring Rob in here  but in all fairness  Eric does have to  like tell  he has to talk  to me throughout  the show  he has to talk  to the interns  during the show  he doesn't have  to write fan fictions 
[03:43:30]  no that he doesn't  have to do  Kyle in Washington  you're on  after Opie Anthony  live  Sam  you're asking  E-Rock  about eating  the wrong half  his wife's ass  his wife's ass  no way  Opie's ass  Hulk Hogan's ass  all day long  okay great  Kyle wants to know  would you eat  Hulk Hogan's ass  if the Hulkster  came in here  and he said  you know what  the Hulkster  wants right now  what the Hulkster  wants is for  my number one  little Hulkamaniac  brother  the number one 
[03:44:00]  Hulkamaniac  the guy that's  been there  supporting Hulkamania  from day one  the kid that's  been training  the kid that's  been praying  the kid that's  been eating  his vitamins  I want my  little brother  E-Rock  I want my  little Hulkamaniac  E-Rock  in here right now  to eat  the Hulkamaniac's  asshole  would you do it  would you eat  the Hulkster's  asshole  no and I  didn't know  you did  voices  I do  you should listen  to the podcast  or when he's eating  his ass  the Hulk does  the ear motion  yeah it does  who wants to  see him go  deeper brother  who wants to  see him go  deeper  weird one 
[03:44:30]  you wouldn't eat  you wouldn't eat  the Hulkster's  ass  why not  it's Hulkster  I'm not  I'm not into  any form of  ass eating  what if he's  Hollywood Hulk Hogan  and he says  that his asshole  is just too sweet  would you then  eat his asshole  do you know what  I'm not a big fan  of wrestling  but I'm there  I would eat his asshole  I would be there  for his asshole  Roland  Roland you're saying  on record  that you would eat  Hulk Hogan's asshole  I'll pull that  you pull that  for me  okay  Rob would you  eat Hulk Hogan's  asshole  no 
[03:45:00]  no you wouldn't  no  he should  with that  turquoise shirt  what about  Obi's asshole  would you eat  that  you wouldn't  okay  can't you hear  half the stuff  he does  he is a  disgusting man  he really is  Obi is a gross  dude  he is  disgusting  and I will say  that to his face  Pete in Long Beach  what did you learn  on today's show  hey what's up  Sam  I have a  what did you learn  from Sunday's show  whoa  and it is that  your wife Jess  has a porno voice  what do you mean  a porno voice  I guess  she has a hot  she has a hot  porno voice 
[03:45:30]  I'm not trying to  offend you here  I'm just saying  you did good  no offense  no offense taken  but  so you were listening  to the Sunday show  and you heard Jess  and you're thinking  porno voice  great show  the whole friend zone  conversation  I completely agree  with you  I actually work  for MTV  and everyone  within the company  realizes that it's  a fucking  preposterous show  it's great though  isn't it  yeah your wife  has a complete  porno voice  and I have a quick  question for Iraq  ask him if he  would eat  Ralfus' ass  Iraq  Ralfus  Chris Jericho's  bodyguard  from Monday Nitro 
[03:46:00]  would you eat  his ass  no  alright  here's a good  question  thank you Pete  that's a throwback  Roland you would  eat Ralfus' ass  whoever he is  come on  what else you got  what else you got  going on  Rob you think  that Iraq  maybe doesn't  spend enough  time listening  to the show  no he does  he's always  on his game  most of the time  he's on his game  you said always  on his game  a minute ago  he's already  been busted  at least twice  this week  that I can  remember  this week  alone  for not  listening to the show  sometimes  he's on his game  sometimes  at times  he is on his game  yeah 
[03:46:30]  what do you think  he what's he doing  in there  well  when was it  it was  I think  yesterday  or two days ago  I saw him  yeah  saving  saving hot girls  in bikini pictures  to his computer  wow  wait wait wait  I couldn't hear him  what did he say  love it with me brother  hot girls  in bikinis  love it with me here  there's nothing wrong  finding women attractive 
[03:47:00]  you know  we talk about the  I like girls  daily twitter account  all the time  I know you  I look at who you  follow on twitter  sometimes  yeah  and you follow  all kinds of  pretty girl  twitter accounts  nothing wrong with that  little eye candy  never hurt anyone  did it  they have multiple  accounts  that's right  you want to see  you want to see  all the pics  right  sure why not  nothing wrong  with that  is there maybe  sometimes  when you're  supposed to be  listening to the show  and you get a little  distracted because  you're saving pictures  of hot girls  in bikinis  because I switched  the back  the desktop 
[03:47:30]  to a hot girl  in a bikini  what are you in  your dorm room  but he was  saving like 30  of them  what  Eric were you  saving pictures  of hot girls  in bikinis  I was switching  them out  and that  distracted you  from the show  I don't believe  it did  did it Rob  I don't  I mean  I don't know  no I think  he just wanted  to say  hey  I'll tell you  this  if it didn't  distract you  from the show  it's only because  you weren't  specifically asked  for something  at that moment  because I'd be  willing to bet  any amount  of money 
[03:48:00]  that if  Anthony had  needed something  while you were  saving pictures  of hot girls  in bikinis  on your desktop  you would not  have known  what he was  talking about  do you think  Anthony will  cut the holly  I don't know  I don't know  if he's listening  or not  but do you  think that maybe  you could save  the hot girls  in bikinis  for after 10  and you know  what after 11  I need you  you do a good  job of focusing  on the after show  but I would  like it if you  could save that  maybe until like  11  sure thing Sam  you know from  now on no more  hot girls in  bikinis 
[03:48:30]  sure whatever  you say  well do you  get upset  or man  what happens  when they bust  you  there's times  when like  I think one  time this week  they were  doing something  about songs  sure  and  when they  don't know  the exact  title  they'll say  a lyric  or a hook  or something  I gotta go  on google  cause I don't  know some  of that music  yeah but  sometimes you  don't have any  fucking idea  what they  asked for  that's  that's  sometimes  Hillary Clinton  thing was  today  yeah  that's  specifically  like you  were like  I don't  have a  fucking clue  what you  guys are  talking about  right now 
[03:49:00]  like you  guys could  be talking  about anything  from Burger  King  to the Dell  guy from  the commercials  I don't  know what  you guys are  talking about  like what  happens in a  scenario like  that  oh I can  tell you  you Sal  I'll get the  info from  you  Eric will  go  what are  they talking  he pulls  one headphone  off  how often  Sal  does Iraq  ask you  what they're  talking about  usually like  when we come  back from  break  yeah  and then  he'll just  start chatting  whatever  wait wait 
[03:49:30]  he'll just  start what  just start  chatting about  whatever  what do you  mean like  in the room  in the room  he's holding  cordon  cause we're  back  we're back  from break  so it's  probably  they're  probably  not  gonna  eat  anything  like  immediately  oh  Eric will  go  wait  what were  they  just  talking  about  cause like  he needs  somebody  to write  it on the  log  and half  the time  I was talking  to him  so I don't  remember what  they were  talking about  because the  sex bagel  show is  happening  in that  room  Eric do  you do  a show  in that  room  do you  sit there 
[03:50:00]  like when  they come  back from  break  thinking  okay I  got the  rejoiner  on  fade it  out  I'm gonna  take a  couple  minutes for  myself  Sal what  does he  talk to  you about  no it  could be  we could  be talking  about like  some work  that I  need to  do or  something  like that  it could  be  anything  but it's  just  could  you be  wrestling  sometimes  no no  it's not  could it  theoretically  be  Sal and I  have nothing  in common  we don't  talk about  like you  know  shit like  that  it's usually  work related  stuff  I'm not  saying  Eric's  dicking  off  but it's  just  no he is  I mean  he's definitely  dicking off  his job is  to listen to  the show  and he's 
[03:50:30]  because he  is talking  to like  us  and it's  like  what does  he talk  to you  about  um  I don't  know  uh  well  he'll like  fart or  something  Eric will  fart  just  occasionally  during the  show  and then  what  he'll make  a big  joke  about it  I mean  you know  he has  to  what goes  on in  there  I didn't  realize  there was  a party  happening  I've been  missing out  sitting in  this studio  he gets  his spray  out  and then  he's  got to  spray 
[03:51:00]  his ass  you spray  your ass  could you  spray your  ass  and he  doesn't know  what's  happening  on the  show  all this  is going  on  no I  mean  he's  got  one  ear  on  and how  often  does he  ask  Sal  what are  they  talking  about  is it  an everyday  occurrence  no  how many times  per week  on average  two to three  and I'm going to say  that's conservative  because you're  a little  you don't want  Eric to get  mad at you  because you're  like you want 
[03:51:30]  to be able  to go back  there and be  like dude  you do that  like six  times a day  I said two  to three  times a week  don't be pissed  at me  is it that  kind of a  thing  a little bit  of that  in there  kind of  I think  you're leading  him on  okay  Rob I'm  picking up  what you're  putting down  you got me  so uh  so Eric  the problem  is worse  than we  imagined  you're farting  you're  you have  thrown parties  I love  when Eric  farts  he's usually  standing up  right  and then 
[03:52:00]  he'll just  do this  like little  half  like half  little  crouch  you gotta  get it  out there  I caught  it from  Roland  because that's  what he  would do  eating  Cheerios  just bends  the knees  a little bit  and he just  looks around  I ate  something  last night  like he'll  say something  you announce  what you ate  the night before  no I'll just  say wow  I don't know  I said I ate  something last  night that's  killing me  or whatever  I can't  fault over that  that is true  I used to  watch Roland  get into  almost like  a quarterback  stance  or in here 
[03:52:30]  and then just  let go  he does  he gets into  almost a three  point stance  do you ever do  that while you  have guests  no  publicist  no  not when  there's people  in there  if it's just  Eric and the  interns  or Sal  but Eric on the  other hand  will not be  like the show's  on  let me  if I have to  pass guests  because it's  a natural  thing  let me be  subtle about it  and just pay  attention to the  show  that's not 
[03:53:00]  his deal  he'll spray  his ass  there was one  time I was  filming in  studio  sure  doing your  work  and I  looked over  and you know  we have the  webcam where  Opie can  see Eric  all I just  saw is Eric  just spraying  the whole  thing down  while there  was a guest  in here  so there's a  guest in here  just saw Eric  dousing  how often  does Eric  pass  I'm being courteous  how often does  Eric pass  guests in that  room  Monday, Tuesday,  Wednesday, Thursday,  Friday  is it every  day 
[03:53:30]  yes  at least once  a day  and Rob  how often  does Eric  pass gas  in that room  intern Rob  at least  four to five  times a day  four to five  times a day  Eric you don't  have to pass  gas that much  people do  you do  everyone does  he farts  he farts  like a storm  he does  now he's  exaggerating  you fart a lot  Eric  no not a lot  but he's  exaggerating  and we have  a technique  no you're not  Eric has this  technique of  propping open  because that  room in there  is very small  propping open 
[03:54:00]  the door  with the garbage  can  well well well  most of the  time is because  when Roland first  shows up in the  morning he's got  his iced coffee  or whatever  he talks a little  bit and then  all of a sudden  he leaves  without us knowing  and the room  just stinks  that's true  so I gotta prop  the door open  just to air it out  there's a party  going on in there  so what about  he's laughing  he knows damn well  that's what he does  he cropped us  the room  but then you leave  Roland  hell yeah  but we don't know  we don't know  he leaves  all of a sudden  you hear  the door shut 
[03:54:30]  and then it just  reeks in here  so what happens  when Bladder  what happens  when Steve Bladder  or someone in  management  because they  stop into the  room to see  what's going on  with the show  that doesn't  happen  they smell  my crop  dust  what happens  when they go  in  does Eric  kind of  try to step  up and get  on his game  Eric is in  charge of that  room  correct  yeah  you would say  so  that's his  room  that's his  room  okay  he's the  general  in there  so what  happens  when somebody  from management  walks in  does Eric  kind of  be like  listen guys  cool the  fuck out  no he'll 
[03:55:00]  just say  like management's  coming or  something like  that  he does  he gives you  the tip  we'll be  like googling  stuff  just waiting  for someone  to call  like Steve's  turning the  corner  and they're  like  um yeah  we're gonna  talk about  this  oh hey  what  he doesn't  do that  I'm not sure  what that meant  but he does  he does  he'll look in  the window  and he'll be like  hey management's  coming  yeah it'll just  be like management's  coming  what do you do  in there  Sal  uh if I have  to pop in  and talk to  Eric about  like you know  some work  that I gotta  do  and Eric  yeah  you have a lot 
[03:55:30]  of distractions  I guess  things go on  eating yogurt  I didn't realize  that summer camp  goes on in there  it is a fun room  to be in  it is  it's a fun room  I had no idea  cause I'm in here  does Troy  Troy doesn't really  go in there  no Troy's in his  studio  Troy comes in  rarely just to  mark stuff down  to cut  but that's about it  is he ever part  of the fun  no  are Danny and  Travis ever part  of the fun  or do they  stay in the office  no nobody really  comes in here  so it's basically  the fun having  is between you  Sal  Roland  and whatever  interns are in there  and my asshole  and Roland's asshole 
[03:56:00]  Lady Trucker  has an idea  I'd like to  hear out  and see what  the room thinks of  Lady Trucker  welcome to  After Open Anthony Live  thank you Sam  yeah they need  some kind of  a button in that  room with a  sounder so  every time  E-Rock farts  we know  that's not a bad  idea  E-Farts  okay  look Lady Trucker  let us handle  we'll handle  the production  elements  did Sal  pass you  then now  thanks  yeah I don't  know if Troy's 
[03:56:30]  listening but Troy  we need to get on  this we need an  E-Rock  the E-Rock is  taking a shit  song  he stopped  taking shits  while the show  is on  I don't think  he can do  the same thing  for farting  do you think  he can Rob  he'll explode  he definitely  can't Roland  I'll explode  if I have to  hold my farts  in  Sal do you  think you  can hold  him in  no  okay  E-Rock  we need  an E-Rock  fart alarm  that's exactly  what they want  to interrupt  interviews and  stuff  well I mean  we'll have to  have some  kind of  form of  vetting  E-Rock  I mean  Troy can you  whip up  an E-Rock 
[03:57:00]  is farting  alarm  can you do  that for  have you  been listening  yeah a little  bit  do you believe  the hijinks  that happen  in that room  of him farting  all the time  he farts  he throws  parties  he's talking  to the interns  the  Sal was  or Rob  was just  telling me  that he  don't know  what's going  on when  the show  on the show  like he's  not listening  because he's  downloading  pictures of  girls in  bikinis  well you  remember I  tweeted  something  he was  looking at  pictures of  sunsets  the one day  I tweeted  a picture of  that  Eric you  look at  pictures of  sunsets  in there  that was  a long  time ago  but that's 
[03:57:30]  what you  do  I did  that day  why  I don't  remember  why  why  did he  just look  at  pictures  of  sunsets  what was  going on  specifically  today  when they  asked you  for the  Hillary Clinton  audio  and you  were like  listen  I don't  know what  the fuck  you guys  are talking  about  right now  I was  looking at  the  Bobo  Twitter  you were  looking at  Bobo  tweets  still  we had  moved on  from  Bobo  you were  just  interested  for  yourself  I was  yeah  I was  going  through  the  whole  thing  oh my  god  listen  Steven 
[03:58:00]  Singer  I'm  going to  tell you  about  Steven  Singer  and Steven  Singer  Jewelers  is there  anyone  better out  there  for  diamonds  than  Steven  Singer  Jewelers  I  think  I  can  answer  that  question  no  nobody  even  comes  close  and  I've  heard  Steven  Singer  is  willing  to  in  the  right  context  eat  assholes  so that's  just what I've heard  I don't know for sure  in fact  Steven is the best place to buy your diamond in America  it's absolutely the only place to go for your engagement ring  I know that I headed down to the other corner of 8th and Walnut  in Philly for my rings  I gave it to that girl that was described as having a porno voice on the air earlier

[03:59:30]  that says on the air  there needs to be another one beneath it  that says in the air  something that just  a little light that just lets us know  that E-Rock is passing gas  that there is flatulence in the air  and that is at the giving of Eric Nagel  Tim in Tulsa  I had a little production idea for Sal  maybe he could throw together  he said  E-Rock just farted  wow  don't get the panda angry 
[04:00:00]  ever since this I don't want to get angry anymore  yeah it's the worst idea  I will tell you this  E-Rock's farts growling like a lion  make about as much sense as pandas do  growling like a lion  so maybe you have something there  what were you thinking when you added the lion sound effect  can we just  I don't want to talk about it  it's horrible  it's fucking stupid  when you said  oh this will be a good sound effect to add to the end  and you added the lion growling  what was going on in your head  I honestly couldn't find a panda 
[04:00:30]  getting angry or anything  so you think  well they must turn into lions  yeah exactly  is that what's going on  you're just like  oh I know  what's similar to a panda  a lion  because they're both  what  they both breathe  they both have noses  no I just  I couldn't get a panda sound effect  no I mean  generally speaking  the reason that the angry panda character is funny  is because it's not something you see every day  so no  I wouldn't think that  at your disposal  would be an angry panda sound effect  otherwise we'd probably just play the sound effect  there'd be no reason for the sweeper 
[04:01:00]  exactly  but you think  if you think  you encountered an angry panda  you'd think it would probably sound like a lion  no I told you exactly what happened  I couldn't find a fucking panda sound effect  so I just put a lion in there  oh like a bear  like a panda bear  did you think grizzly bear  I bet you could find a grizzly bear sound effect  that probably would have been better yeah  than a  I bet if a panda gets mad  it sounds more like a grizzly than a lion  well in hindsight  the entire thing was garbage  it was a bad idea  from tip to top  yeah exactly  so one sound effect  in the entire piece of shit 
[04:01:30]  you know  what are you gonna do  maybe top to bottom  tip to what  what's the tip version of  tip is to top is  or top is to tip  is bottom is to  end  I don't know  it could work right  tip to end though  that doesn't sound good at all  huh  tip to ass  and that's what you are Sal  and Eric  do you know what we were just talking about  yes  okay good  I was just checking  it didn't look like you were looking up bikini pictures just then  moving forward  any changes in the way you do work 
[04:02:00]  or are you gonna keep  you kinda happy with the way  the Eric Nagel Express is moving  I guess something has to change  do you really  I don't wanna keep upsetting them  he's got a good rhythm going on  you like his rhythm  I love it  you think he knows what he's got going on  well it's funny  I mean  and he knows that  he's funny with rolling with it now  yeah  he's on the right track  right  yeah  no reason to pull that lever yet  and change course  no  Eric maybe stay on the course  maybe stay the course  see how this mission plays out  maybe the problem is  that the Opie and Anthony show 
[04:02:30]  has some hosts  that have become too reliant  on their producers  is that the way you're thinking?  don't fix what isn't broken?  is that what it is?  well Eric  I mean  I think that's a hard argument  because one could argue that  your work  your job  is horribly broken  your work ethic  is terribly shattered  but do you think  maybe the hosts  are too reliant on you?  no  not at all  you don't think so  you think that  them saying  our guy who runs our board for us  listening to the show  while the show is live  is an okay request? 
[04:03:00]  I think that's fair  and what about  what  what about Rob's thing  of Eric farts way too much?  I've been doing it lately  and letting him know  yeah  oh I mean  it's not like I can't hear it  but  alright  we need to set up  some kind of alert system  of to when Eric farts  why  who cares?  a lot of people care  Rob does  do you?  yeah  but it has to be like  the interns have to push it  you know  because they can hear it  obviously  because Eric  can't say the amount  that he does  during the week  I barely fart 
[04:03:30]  I tried to push one out  today after  don't go  don't go to the dark side  and then he just goes  well you lost that debate  that's what Eric said?  because you couldn't  push out a fart  you told him he lost a debate?  I don't think I said that  why don't you come back here  and fart it up  is that what happened?  wait what Sal?  I said why don't you  come back here  and fart it up  yeah I don't know  fart it up is weird  I get what you're going for  but fart it up  you like that Roland?  listen  we gotta let Ron and Fez 
[04:04:00]  take their time  in this studio  I want to thank Rob  and Sal  and Roland  for their expert witness testimony  thank you  Troy you'll be working on the  how was Philly by the way?  it was awesome  yeah  I'm there again Saturday  for a train?  opening up for a train  yeah  that's sick  but you'll be working on  the E-Rock fart alarm?  yeah  definitely  a lot of exciting things  happening here on the  Opie and Anthony show  every day  show content today Sam  every day  I provide  alright you're welcome  for show content every day  I'm the host  I provide it all the time  this is what you're here for
