<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Larry King's introduction, immediately transitioning into a discussion about Tracy Morgan's homophobic remarks and subsequent apology, and the broader implications for comedy and acceptable speech.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, used highly offensive language while debating the hypocrisy of special interest groups and referencing other controversial figures like Don Imus and Lenny Bruce.  The conversation included speculation about increased censorship in comedy and the manipulative use of apologies by public figures. Jim Norton was mentioned in the discussion. Opie briefly mentioned his love of hockey and his kettlebell workouts.  The discussion then shifted to Anthony Weiner's sex scandal, again employing graphic language to describe the situation and his subsequent rehab.

The show then moved to a segment about a musician's performance, followed by a discussion of dreams. Opie recounted a dream about obsessively pursuing a picture with Jack Nicholson, while Anthony described a dream involving a threesome, which was later interpreted by a caller, "Steve the Therapist," as a metaphor for workplace issues at SiriusXM.  This was followed by further discussion of Anthony Weiner's scandal, including President Obama's comments.  Technical difficulties with the show's online stream were addressed, with interaction with a SiriusXM employee named "Mars."

A substantial portion of the broadcast was dedicated to a discussion about the origins and various versions of the song "House of the Rising Sun," culminating in the confirmation that Lead Belly wrote it.  Different versions were played, highlighting audio issues with one recording.  Comedian Bobo, a friend of the hosts, appeared to promote his upcoming stand-up performance.  The show played an audio clip of Bobo introducing another comedian, Rich Voss, at a comedy club, and then played a sound clip of comedian Roland's unsuccessful attempt at a Godzilla roar.  The hosts also discussed the death of a Liquid Metal DJ. Throughout this segment,  the hosts continued their use of vulgar language, sexual innuendo, and off-color humor.

A later segment heavily featured E-Rock's poorly-received eHarmony video, featuring jokes about food and genitalia, which received harsh criticism from Opie and Anthony.  Anthony Weiner's scandal remained a central theme, with a prolonged, unsuccessful comedic bit involving a comedian called "the Virus" repeatedly failing to tell a joke about it. The hosts discussed a Fox Business news anchor accused of racism for using what was perceived as Ebonics while discussing President Obama,  a lawsuit involving a graphic description of a sexual assault, a news report about a chimpanzee attack victim (with focus on the reporter's apparent lack of awareness of the victim's blindness), and the Casey Anthony trial, expressing strong negative opinions about the defendant using highly offensive language.  They also shared personal anecdotes about difficult relationships with their fathers.  "The Virus" was a studio guest during this segment, attempting (and failing) his stand-up routine.

A segment featured a YouTube video preview by the Ultimate Warrior, containing a scathing attack against Hulk Hogan, filled with accusations of cocaine use, an open marriage, and claims of Hogan facilitating the breakup of Randy Savage and Miss Elizabeth. The hosts speculated on the veracity of these claims, referencing other wrestlers (Macho Man Randy Savage, the Iron Sheik, Andre the Giant, Rikishi, the Big Boss Man, and others), and making graphic sexual insinuations about Hogan's wife, Linda.  Comedian Esther Ku then joined the show, discussing her career, adoption by missionaries, and her sexually explicit stand-up comedy.  The conversation included crude humor and offensive jokes about race, sex, and family dynamics, and Ku performed a song about masturbation live on air.  She promoted her appearance at a book party.

The final segment featured more of Esther Ku, whose music included explicit lyrics about sex acts. The conversation continued to be highly informal and sexually charged, with discussions of Kuâ€™s experiences in the music industry, including a song ending up on a Brazilian porn site.  She discussed upcoming performances and shared anecdotes about race, sex, and a memorable encounter with a large penis.  Her two guitar players were briefly discussed, with one criticized for his loud and poor musicianship.  The segment concluded with Ku, a brown belt in Taekwondo, playfully punching and kicking a staff member named Sam at the hosts' urging.  The show maintained its irreverent and deliberately provocative tone throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM's Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  I forget it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  I guess my nipples hard, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mouth?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to a show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to enjoy it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  By the way, thank you, Larry King. Thank you.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi, everybody.  How you doing?  Doing well on this wonderful whatever morning.  See, I don't say the day anymore just in case they play it, you know, a replay or something. 
[00:01:00]  It sounds silly.  I like listening to replays.  Yeah.  Because I get tricked.  Do you?  Yeah, then I'm thinking, oh, wait a minute, I'm not there, so how do you think where I get tricked?  It tricked me. I tricked myself.  Hockey.  You guys know I like my hockey, right?  Of course.  I'm fading.  When is hockey going to be over?  July?  Apparently, tomorrow, I guess.  It was an exciting game last night. 
[00:01:30]  Bruins beat the Canucks to push a game seven, but it's June 14th.  I told Anthony, my last hockey game, I went to a game maybe four months ago at this point.  Yeah.  I haven't been to a hockey game in four months, and I'm a regular at the rink.  At the rink?  I know my team sucked a dick, but still, I mean, I haven't gone to a hockey game in four months.  They're still playing.  Yeah.  Wow.  Apparently, Boston.  Holy, holy Jesus.  Palomino.  Well, they're going to have to win in Vancouver, though. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That might be a little tough.  But quite a few.  What did they score?  Four?  It was.  In like a little over four minutes.  Oh, yeah.  You were there then.  You were on top of that.  That's crazy.  Well, there's so many Boston people that we all know, especially these dumbass comics.  Yeah.  They, I'm kidding.  But they're constantly tweeting, like, holy shit.  The score and stuff.  The score and things like that.  And, you know, I saw some highlights and stuff.  Wow, they got to pull the goalie. 
[00:02:30]  He was giving up crazy.  He was not standing on his head.  Yeah.  It was four nothing early.  Yeah.  And I had the Louis C.K. season two.  Yeah.  That I brought home yesterday, and I really wanted to watch hockey.  I didn't know what to do.  And they made it very obvious what I needed to do.  The game was over, even though it only ended up at 5-2.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But it was four zip very early on.  I'm like, all right, this thing is over.  They're going to be playing a game seven.  I want to check out some Louis C.K.  You could watch some shit for pure pleasure. 
[00:03:00]  You get your Louis C.K. disc?  No, I didn't, and I'm kind of thinking.  What do you mean you didn't?  Well, well.  Did you run out of here too fast yesterday?  No, no, no.  I'm learning we can't run out of here too fast.  Too fast.  But Roland told me it was going to be today.  I would get it.  No.  Yeah.  He would never just give me one another one.  No, no.  He said more was showing up later, so I could have hung out and gotten it yesterday.  Oh, but you wanted out of here.  But I got to do my kettlebell workouts. 
[00:03:30]  It's crazy.  Is it crazy or cray-cray?  It's cray-cray.  Was that cray-cray?  It's crazy.  That's the Monday routine is that, and then Wednesday is arms and upper, and then Friday  is legs and stuff.  Jeez.  You're all in, man.  Yeah, I have to be at this point.  Mer.  I want to be like Wiener.  I want to be like Anthony Wiener and take my shirt off and take creepy pictures and send  them to girls while I hold my dick.  My dick.  My dick. 
[00:04:00]  But you got to explain, they're creepy because of the look he did.  Yes, the snarling look.  He has in those pictures.  Wow, sexy man.  The creepy part isn't that he showed his dick.  No, who cares?  For the most part, it's because of that creepy look.  That creep look.  He looks in the camera like, I look good.  Yeah, look at me.  And here's my dick.  Look at me.  Shut up.  Even Obama had to basically comment on the Wiener thing.  Obama was like, yeah, well.  Like him or hate him.  He's the president of the United States, and he has to comment about Wiener and his dick.  Yeah, he said, he goes, you know, if he was in that position, he'd resign. 
[00:04:30]  And all I was thinking is, please, could there be some pictures of Obama?  Please.  Remember that big hog?  Yeah, that big, delicious hog.  Ah, I got the Obama thing quick.  You brought it up here.  Obama.  This is Obama.  Obama.  On a day when President Barack Obama.  God, I hate this guy.  He's awful.  On a day when President Obama.  On a day when.  Bloody, bloody, bloody, bloody. 
[00:05:00]  How the hell did this guy get him broadcasting?  I know, he stinks his walls.  Who did he shrink you to sleep?  He sounds like Bobby?  Bobby?  I saw Obama, Bobby.  Bobby?  On a day when President Barack Obama traveled to North Carolina to talk about jobs.  He bought some cocaine.  He also weighed in on the Twitter scandal.  Twister.  That is currently engulfing New York representative Anthony Weiner.  Obama said in an interview that will air Tuesday on NBC's Today show, quote, I can tell you that if it was me, I would resign. 
[00:05:30]  The House will be in order.  Congress returned to work Monday, but the congressman was not.  By the way, that was Anthony Weiner's dick.  His dick.  He's using it as a gavel.  Yeah, they are.  He lent it out as a gavel.  I don't know if you know that, but that's exactly what's going on.  Yeah.  Listen, again, it's Anthony Weiner's fucking dick.  Hard cock.  He must have been really grabbing the shaft, thus making the head nice and tough and hard.  Was it turgid?  Turgid.  To get that rigid wood sound. 
[00:06:00]  I want to thank Jimmy for bringing the word turgid to this show.  It's very unrigid.  Because I don't think I ever used that word in my life before.  Yes, turgid.  Jimmy brought it here.  Now I can't say it enough.  It's a wonderful word.  Turgid.  The House will be in order.  Congress returned to work Monday, but the congressman was not in his office.  What?  I've made some mistakes.  I've acknowledged it.  Instead, speaking to reporters over the weekend, he has reportedly gone into rehab at an undisclosed location for a disorder. 
[00:06:30]  This world is insane.  You've got Anthony Weiner going to sex rehab, which I think in this case is complete and utter bullshit.  That's nothing.  It's a guy that just doesn't want to be married and be a father, in my humble opinion.  He wants to be showing his dick.  His dick on this new technology.  Right, to a lot of fucking women.  Yeah.  And then you get Tracy Morgan, who's got to go to Nashville and make believe he cares about gay people.  When you know he really doesn't.  In my humble opinion. 
[00:07:00]  In my opinion.  I don't think he hates gay people, but he doesn't care about it.  No, it's not like this big care thing where all of a sudden now he feels legitimately inside, he feels he should make restitution and get involved in the gay causes.  No!  I had to do that with you.  I'm sorry.  I know that's your thing, but it's driving me nuts.  It's crazy.  He apologized for something he said.  This has been eating me away all night.  He apologized for something he said on a comedy stage when he absolutely was doing his act. 
[00:07:30]  He wasn't even doing a Michael Richards thing, so he can't even argue that part of this.  You can't even argue that part of it.  There's so many comics I've talked to, including Jimmy Norton, that said at some point or another, when it finally hits the stage, when the shit finally hits the stage, and not in a Michael Richards way.  But just in your basic material, no matter what it is, when they finally call you out and you have to make an apology for that, we are really fucking doomed. 
[00:08:00]  But it's been happening, though.  It's not a new thing.  It's like, since Lenny Bruce, and I'm not comparing Tracy to Lenny, but I'm saying people have always judged you on what you said on stage.  And what we do now is we grab somebody, find out what, we like, people like to use a moment like that as a segue into their particular ideology being talked about more.  Like, where's the Catholics?  Where are all the Catholics who are offended?  Oh, that's right.  It's not their thing.  It's only because he offended homosexuals, so they can hear from the homosexuals.  In two weeks, somebody will say something about the Asians. 
[00:08:30]  Homosexuals won't say a fucking word.  They'll be the Asians.  Everyone uses a verbal slip-up or a tasteless moment on stage to segue into a conversation about themselves and their own cause.  It's very frustrating.  I know it's been happening since Lenny Bruce, but what's scaring me is it seems like it's ramping up.  It seems like it's ramping up a little bit.  I think we're going to have a lot of Tracy Morgan incidents in the next year or two.  Oh, if that's going to be the new fucking thing to pick on.  I'm telling you, I think it's ramping up now. 
[00:09:00]  You know, it was very, he talked about abusing women and spousal abuse, and that just is not anything to make a joke about.  Some of the funniest shit I've heard is about that.  You watch the honeymoon as he's threatening to punch his wife in the face.  It's classic comedy.  The Lockhorns.  Right.  Breitbart said, he had an amazing quote.  He said, and I hate to keep putting Breitbart like he's fucking Aristotle, but he made a great point. 
[00:09:30]  What he said in comedy is the exhaust system of a society, which is a great way to look at it.  It really is this, I don't look at it like it dictates policy, or it makes things a certain way, or it changes perception.  It is just a venting system for when you're frustrated.  When you're frustrated, or when you see something funny.  What you need to run the car.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  It's not just shit coming out, it's important.  Yeah, it's kind of what you do with the process of, like, I guess the car runs and the exhaust is the shit coming out the back. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, right.  But you kind of need it to keep that car running, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  No, he had a great take on this.  But I'm on the tailpipe routine.  The Black Roland that's on CNN had a great take on this.  A Black Roland.  Well, I didn't agree with his Imus thing so much.  He said Imus, he was pretty open-minded about this whole thing in general, but said Imus definitely should have been fired because he wasn't considered a shock jock when he said nappy-headed hoes.  Stop with the semantics.  Like, he was having some pretty powerful people on that show, so he wasn't looked at as a shock jock anymore. 
[00:10:30]  And he, this was his point.  I'm not sure if I agree with it, but it opened my mind a little bit, I have to be honest with you.  He said if a shock jock said nappy-headed hoes, most likely people would have just said, ah, no big deal.  But because it was Imus and he was having these powerful, powerful people on his show, that made it different.  That's what he's saying.  I don't know if I agree, but it was an interesting way to look at it.  I think that's his way of wanting Imus fired for offending what he holds sacred, but not wanting to even admit to himself, he said something I don't like, I want him fired. 
[00:11:00]  Everyone has a little check mark next to why they're saying it.  Like, here's why, in this case, you shouldn't say that.  Because people are never going to be revealing enough to go, you know what, it's selfish, I didn't like it, I want you to get in trouble because I didn't like it.  People will never give you that piece of honesty for themselves.  But he did admit, you know, no one should be using the N-word. 
[00:11:30]  You can't be the guy saying, well, we should be able to use the N-word, but, you know, white people, let's say, are not allowed to.  He says that's completely ridiculous.  He's right, although.  It should be across the board if that's your thinking.  The seven dirty words are fair because not one broadcaster can say cunt on the radio, like terrestrial radio or TV.  No one can say fuck you.  No one can say tits.  You can't say it.  Black, white, Asian, that's all you ask for is consistency.  If a gay guy did certain things that Tracy said, even if he worded a little bit differently, but he was just as harsh about his own family, well, that would be art because the point of the joke was his own family. 
[00:12:00]  You know what I mean?  If you're saying the right thing, you're allowed to say it.  If you're saying something that is disagreeable to certain people, you're not allowed to say it.  It's fucking phony.  Yeah.  Can I say stuff because I consider myself a psychopath?  Does that open me up to where I can now say anything because I am crazy?  Right.  Yeah.  The crazy.  Hey, wait a minute.  I'm a nut.  I can say shit like that.  It's.  Oh, that's like the ultimate. 
[00:12:30]  But yeah.  If you're gay, you can say shit about gay people.  If you're black, you can say anything about black people and go down the line.  But you should be able to say whatever the fuck you want, especially on a comedy stage.  Especially on a comedy stage.  Especially.  Yeah.  Okay.  There's consequences if you walk around your office saying what Tracy Morgan said, obviously.  Right.  Okay.  But on a comedy stage.  That's what's so ridiculous about this.  The fact that Tracy did apologize is good enough.  He acknowledged it.  An apology was down.  And that's what I guess the 30 Rock people were asking for. 
[00:13:00]  An apology.  And they were the ones that really made him apologize.  Yeah.  It's a fake apology.  As a stand up, the best thing is you guys work alone.  You guys are just there on stage with your material and you could say, fuck you.  I'm not going to do it.  But Tracy was in that position of working for a network and you do have to make some concessions.  But to the extent where now he's got to meet with GLAAD and all kinds of sensitivity shit.  That is horse shit.  It's a headline.  Tracy Morgan working with GLAAD following anti-gay tirade. 
[00:13:30]  Tracy Morgan's voice is support for gay marriage after apologizing.  I think they should be able to get mad for homophobic comments.  That's what I think.  And he has to do a PSA.  This is all phony shit that he's being forced to do.  It's very phony.  How about this?  Because Tracy's a famous guy.  Yeah.  I would do a PSA for gay, anti-gay violence and I've never gotten in trouble for saying  anything.  Oh, yeah.  I have never.  And I'm not nearly as famous as Tracy is. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, they don't want you.  But why would they?  Right.  I'm a fucking nasty comedian.  Right.  I don't want to see violence against gays.  I think it's terrible.  I'm willing to do a PSA.  Why won't they want...  They won't ask me to do that unless I was to say something very anti-gay in my act, get  in trouble and get my name in the headlines.  Because they want it to be a consequence.  Yeah.  They want it to be a punishment.  Not a sincere apology and helping them and that.  They want it to be a punishment.  They're despicable, this glad, because they're basically holding Tracy Morgan hostage now.  They got him.  They got him. 
[00:14:30]  They're like, you're going to do what we want now.  And we'll tell you when it's enough.  And then we won't go to your bosses and we won't boycott and we won't do this.  Yeah, absolutely.  In this society, an apology means nothing.  Society.  It means absolutely nothing.  When we were growing up, if you did something wrong, you could pretty much get out of a lot  of shit by apologizing and meaning it.  Like, oh yeah, I was a dick that day or whatever.  But now, man, that don't mean shit.  That's only the start.  That's where you start. 
[00:15:00]  That's where you start with the apology and then it's just eating shit the whole way  throughout the process.  That's why I think GLAAD is despicable and these other groups.  I'm not just pointing out GLAAD.  They all do it.  The Asian groups do it.  The black groups have done it.  You start with the apology and then we got you.  We're holding you hostage and we'll let you know when we'll let go of you.  And they all start off well-intentioned.  Like, what they do, like, gays and lesbians not wanting to be abused in the media or whatever.  Hey, look, they got a shitty deal. 
[00:15:30]  I mean, they're fucking always, they can't get married.  They can't, you know, it's like enough for it.  They're probably sick and tired of having to fight forgetting what most people are allowed  to have just by being alive.  But if they go too far, when you start targeting what people are saying in humor and it's like,  I don't know what Tracy sounded like when he said it.  Maybe he sounded like he meant it.  I don't know.  But it's like they would have to run Howard for that gay joke.  And they target jokes and references that aren't based in hatred.  And they know the difference.  Every moment cannot be used to segue into a conversation about your cause or your legitimate 
[00:16:00]  beefs.  And it's affected comedies.  That's why most comedies fucking blow now.  Every once in a while, one gets through the cracks, obviously.  But in general, man, they got it set up where it's really tough to make funny movies or funny  TV shows.  And just like you said about you hadn't heard Tracy's comment in the context and the way  he said it, neither did right.  Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of the people that are pissed about this and making  him apologize. 
[00:16:30]  Maybe a couple of people in the club heard it.  One person heard it was offended and then went out and talked to his minion and they read,  you know, what he said, not even knowing how it was said.  At least Jimmy could say, look, I don't know how it was said.  So I don't know.  But these people are like, well, we don't know how it's said.  But when I read it, it sure looks offensive.  I swear to you, that's an old joke, man.  I can't prove it.  But I feel like I've heard that before from Tracy and we've seen him over the years.  He may have done it even at one of our virus shows. 
[00:17:00]  I can't prove that.  But I just have this feeling that that joke's been around a while in Tracy's repertoire.  Maybe.  And this is why special interest groups all are terrible.  Look at what happened with Wiener and the feminist groups are coming out and they're  in a tough position because he's a Thai politician they like and they're not going after him.  They're saying, well, apparently our congressman was a 14-year-old boy.  They're giving him the, you know what, he was kind of a bad boy excuse.  Dice Clay, they wanted to lynch in 1989 and 1990. 
[00:17:30]  Yep.  This guy is sending photos of his dick, he communicated with a 17-year-old, he didn't,  and they're giving him a pass.  But we all know what he was doing with the 17-year-old, but you can't say it or prove it.  He was fishing.  Lining up his stuff.  The guy was fishing, seeing if there was a possibility there.  But being that they're like that, how can anybody respect?  Of course.  Any special interest group.  They're so inconsistent.  But they're so self-serving.  And they so keep quiet when it doesn't serve their interest to be allowed. 
[00:18:00]  We've known Tracy for many, many years.  Unfortunately, he doesn't do our show as much as he used to, but...  As if ever, the bees scared him.  Yeah.  That's the last time he did our show.  But reading these articles, you just know Tracy's like, what the fuck?  Tracy Morgan has told GLAAD President Jared Barrios that he will team up with the group  to meet with LGBT youth and participate in an anti-bullying PSA.  What is LGBT?  Lesbian.  Gay.  Bisexual, transgender, I guess. 
[00:18:30]  Bisexual, transgender.  Transgender really is involved in that?  Well, and I must step in here.  All right.  During a call, Morgan committed to meet with LGBT youth from New York's Alley Forney Center  who have been hurt or left homeless by parental rejection, as well as family members who have  lost children to anti-gay violence, according to GLAAD.  Just all this for a fucking joke.  Now he has to be educated.  But if you're saying that for real, there's a difference between them joking around. 
[00:19:00]  Everybody knows the difference.  I'm not going to lie to you.  It's extremely sad that you got some kids that are homeless and shit because their families  didn't want to accept their gayness.  That's really sad.  Yes.  Gayness?  But what does that have to do with fucking Tracy Morgan?  You heard that wrong.  Yeah.  Nothing.  Seriously?  Yeah.  It's not his fucking responsibility?  Right.  No.  He's doing his job just like everybody.  And you know, to bring up Lenny Bruce and stuff like that, that was also during a time  where people were really fucking kind of crazy about that.  And it was considered indecency. 
[00:19:30]  It wasn't about offending people on a group basis.  Like, it was more about indecency and the law.  Like, the police came in and arrested them for offensive language that was against the law.  This is a politically correct thing.  It transcends.  It's worse.  It's worse than the cops coming in and arresting Lenny Bruce on stage for saying, fuck, because 
[00:20:00]  it's considered offensive and obscene, actually.  Can I say the difference?  I think it's all the same thing because it comes from the same place, but it's become  more covert.  You can't do that anymore.  Right.  Everybody knows you can't pull a guy off stage.  But it's almost like, I'm sure certain acts of racism have become more covert because  you can't just say, hey, boy, what are you doing here?  So you keep it more subtle.  My house.  Stuff while your house is a little bit.  You know what I'm saying?  It's short.  You can't do it that way. 
[00:20:30]  And it's the same offensive and indecency that they saw was offending religion.  That's how these people feel about what Tracy said.  And you make a good point.  It's very similar to what went on in radio.  Like, people getting fired and stuff, not for FCC, you know, violations.  Like you said, more subtle, like the special interest groups getting to the corporate  heads.  And the way they were saying it was, oh, look, hey, we're not trying to squash people's  freedom of speech, but we don't like what you said. 
[00:21:00]  So not the FCC, no laws, but we're going to go to your boss and we're going to exercise  our right to protest and boycott the sponsors and everything.  And it's like, really, aren't you just taking a fucking left turn here and really restricting  freedom of speech?  Right.  Again, it's just semantics.  Of course.  You're using a different technique to squash people's freedom of speech.  It's a threat of some type of retribution, not based on just a natural occurrence, based 
[00:21:30]  on what I'm saying.  I say something anti-gay in a joking manner.  No laws prohibit me from doing that.  But because someone's offended, they now have an avenue to pursue getting me fired.  So that's no different than there being a law against me saying something anti-gay, even  in humor.  And that's why I go back to Jimmy.  That's way worse.  Way worse.  And we hated the FCC, but it turned out the FCC wasn't the enemy. 
[00:22:00]  How many radio guys got fired in the last five, six years, okay?  And how many of them deserve to be fired because they went against FCC regulations?  I don't think one.  I think it was all that PC bullshit.  I couldn't think of one off the top of my head.  The station's saying they have a zero tolerance policy against this type of hate speech.  Even the...  Not with your hate speech.  You want hate speech?  Watch me drive home.  Even the radio show where the woman died with the water drinking contest, horrible situation,  obviously, within FCC regulations. 
[00:22:30]  Believe it or not.  Yeah, man.  Just a horrible tragedy.  I'm not trying to defend those guys, but I'm just saying overall, I can't think of a  DJ or a radio show that got fired because of the FCC.  No.  I can't think of one.  But a lot of them have been fired because of the shit they've said on the air.  Yeah.  I'll bet you everybody who's offended by what Tracy said, and there's a lot of people that  might be really upset.  No.  I'll bet you if you polled them, let's just say there's a hundred of them.  Yeah.  I'll bet you at 90 of them, when the Janet Jackson thing happened, went, who gives a 
[00:23:00]  fuck?  Let it go.  What?  You're worried about a titty?  What the fuck?  It's all where you're standing.  It's like everyone wants to legislate the way you think.  It's so irritating.  And it's like, I never want anybody penalized for what they're saying and that stuff.  So why can't everybody be like that?  It's like you're screaming and nobody's listening.  And historically, the gays are more open.  Very.  Well, they're more open to people being able to speak about different subject matter and  take it to the limit because they would like to have certain freedoms that they don't have. 
[00:23:30]  So the freedom of speech and things like that, very important.  But then, yeah, like Jimmy said, they hear one thing that's against them, regardless of  the context.  And I got to shut that down.  Well, you now make a good point.  And this might surprise you, my friend, but I was checking out the Twitter trend, Tracy  Morgan, you know, when this all hit and very disappointed in black people in general that 
[00:24:00]  were part of that Twitter trend because they were defending Tracy like he should be able  to say this and do this, which I agree with.  But then I'm thinking these same people when the nappy headed hole went down, we're like  almost celebrating the same fucking thing.  Yeah.  Again, it's based on the fact that he's black.  I miss white.  So.  Right.  But that goes with your point.  You know, yeah, it's OK when it hits your group. 
[00:24:30]  But then as soon as it it hits another group, oh, my God, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No matter how liberal and open minded you are, if something, you know, hits you directly,  you're going to be all pissed off.  Right.  But you can't you can't have it both ways.  I mean, the same people going, you know, Tracy should have been allowed to do this should  have been kind of on Imas's side, which I know that might be tough for some people to  do.  But that's the point we're kind of making today.  That's why you can't respect any of it.  And we all know the difference between between doing racial humor and what Michael Richards 
[00:25:00]  did.  Like, I think every most common sense people know the difference in your intent.  And intent is everything.  If you're walking by a guy and he steps on your foot and he goes, oh, sorry, there's  a lot different than a guy stepping on your foot and then make an eye contact with you  going, what?  They're both the same thing.  But the intent is different.  So the intent means everything.  If you're trying to make people laugh, it's a lot different than if you're trying to hurt  people and penalize them.  Yeah.  The Michael Richards thing obviously was tough.  You know, it was on a comedy stage.  But I remember when I was coming up in this business, bosses always said, just give me something 
[00:25:30]  that I could defend you with.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And in the Michael Richards situation, it was tough because for a lot of people, that  wasn't his act, which made it really tough to defend that.  I still think he, you know, on a comedy stage, anything should go.  But I think we got a little carried away with that one.  That was a tougher one, though, to defend.  He deserved getting shit for it because he got caught.  He was being angry.  And there is a difference between that and being funny.  If he had said something like that, but in humor, or there was a punchline to it. 
[00:26:00]  Right.  But he really wasn't.  He was just calling people niggers.  He was mad.  You can't yell that at a table.  Right.  But social justice, again, should be.  He's lucky that that table full of guys didn't fucking throw a bottle at him or knock his  teeth out because that's a stupid thing to yell in a public place at somebody.  But they also came right back at him with racial epithets.  Absolutely.  Which, you know, okay.  Which is fine.  So they got Tracy Morgan.  He's being held hostage, so we might have to get a team together to go rescue him. 
[00:26:30]  Make for a good action movie, I think.  He's going to be doing the Amplify Your Voice PSA campaign to combat anti-LGBT bullying.  Additionally, Morgan plans to return to Tennessee.  He's got a whole fucking schedule now.  Going back to Tennessee next week to apologize to audience members offended by his comments.  I would bet how many people were in that comedy club that day?  I don't know what kind of room it is.  I don't know.  What was the name of the room?  I don't know.  I would say 1%. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  I would say 1% of the people.  Yeah.  But I'm sure there'll be hundreds of people that show up for the apology because they get  to see Tracy Morgan.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  According to Glad, Morgan told the group Monday that he regretted his remarks.  I know how bad bullying can hurt.  He said, I was bullied when I was a kid.  Oh.  We know Tracy.  This is not Tracy.  I was bullied.  We understand.  He's got a great gig and he's doing what he can.  But once again, this is all bullshit in the end.  I was bullied when I was a kid.  I'm sorry for what I said. 
[00:27:30]  I didn't mean it.  I never want to use my comedy to hurt anyone.  My family knew what it was like to feel different.  My brother was disabled and I lost my father to AIDS in 1987.  I didn't know that.  My dad wasn't gay, but I also learned about homophobia then because of how people treated  people who were sick with that.  Parents should support and love the kids no matter what.  Gay people deserve the same right to be happy in this country as everyone else.  Our laws should support that.  I hope that my fans, gay, straight, whatever, forgive.  And I hope my family forgives me for this. 
[00:28:00]  His family don't care.  Can I say this, though?  About this.  If that's...  I don't know Tracy well enough to know how he feels about gay people.  I really don't.  But is that the way he really feels?  Like, does he really feel like, hey, look, all kidding aside, I don't...  I think gay should be married.  Maybe he really does feel that way.  Oh, he probably thinks gay should be married.  He probably doesn't give a crap either way.  Yeah, which doesn't make...  Yeah, if he feels gay should be married, that has no bearing on what he says about gays in  his act.  Right.  No, it shouldn't.  But although he should kind of...  You know, you should somehow give that in your act. 
[00:28:30]  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, wherever you really stand, you should make that kind of the point of what you're  doing, wherever you really stand, even if it's wrong.  So I don't know what the way he really feels is.  I didn't know his father died of AIDS, though.  I didn't know that either.  Maybe I'm lying.  Yeah.  But again, Tracy can be...  I'm sorry.  Like, let's say he makes fun of AIDS.  You can't say that he doesn't know what it's like to suffer from that or have somebody  who loves to suffer from that.  So does that give him the right to make fun of AIDS? 
[00:29:00]  Of course it does.  And I'm sure a lot of people made fun of Tracy about his father.  So Tracy's sort of right in there, no?  Sure.  Kind of what he was saying.  Probably had to say a million times that his father wasn't gay and had to explain it.  Yeah, in 87.  Absolutely.  If anyone got AIDS, they thought it was...  It's called the gay disease for fucking...  Forever.  For years, yeah.  Still.  And then the...  Do you want the...  I mean, the apology is just ridiculous, but I think most of us sort of know this, right?  Waddle doodle!  Apologize! 
[00:29:30]  What did he say?  I didn't actually read it.  I guess Russell Simmons is getting involved.  Oh, God.  Why?  I believe everyone deserves the right to be happy and marry who they want to, gay, white,  black, male, or female, Morgan told Simmons.  And when Simmons emphasized the timeliness of this issue as we try to get gay marriage  passed in New York, Morgan jumped at the chance to lend his voice.  Let me know where the rally's at, bus. 
[00:30:00]  He said...  I'll be there.  I'll be there.  I'll be there.  The apology.  I guess the reason I'm successful is because I'm so unfiltered.  Yes.  Yes.  And we like that in entertainment.  We like unfiltered people.  Blurt it out.  It's so fucking refreshing, no matter who you are.  I guarantee we get gay guys and fucking lesbians on the phone saying they like their shit  on filter, too.  Yeah.  And sometimes, as a result, I say really stupid shit. 
[00:30:30]  He does.  Yes.  But that's fucking entertaining as all hell.  I never thought Tracey realized that.  Yeah, I didn't either.  Geez, wow.  That's the first time I've ever heard Tracey acknowledge that.  Right.  That's insightful.  Grab that lunchbox, go to work.  Yeah.  Right.  What are you talking about?  I don't know, Jimmy.  Sometimes I say stupid shit.  Didn't Jimmy say it yesterday?  You like being caught by surprise in comedy, right?  Yeah.  That's really important.  It's a big thing.  You're sitting in your seat and go, whoa!  Yeah.  Right?  The only way I think Tracey should apologize... 
[00:31:00]  I mean, look, I would have apologized along with him.  Like, I get why he did it, so I'm not being some phony maverick.  He shouldn't have said he was sorry.  He's got a career and millions of dollars.  I get it.  I would have said I was sorry, too.  I really would have.  I wouldn't have lost the gig over it.  It's not worth it.  Especially for a dumb joke that may not even reflect how you really feel.  Would it be a fake apology?  This is what I say.  I don't know.  If I said something that I really believed in a joke, and I had to come out and apologize  for it, like if somebody asked me to apologize for the fact that I made fun of Islam, 
[00:31:30]  or the fact that I made fun of race, it would be a very phony apology.  If I said something in like a weird moment on stage or a tirade that was vicious, that  I didn't mean at all, that was like, ugh, that's not even the way I feel, then maybe  I would.  But either way, if I had Tracey's mistakes he's facing, I would say I was sorry.  Yeah, he was...  I'm not going to pretend I wouldn't.  Were you in agreement he was going for a joke?  It's hard to say without hearing it.  I would assume...  I would hope he was, but without hearing it, it's really hard both ways.  Because was he saying something? 
[00:32:00]  I could picture him going, my father would shoot him in the head, being silly, or was  he going, I would shoot the little nigga in the head, like being serious?  I don't know.  So if he was being serious, that's harder to defend, because if you're just coming out  and going like, hey, all kidding aside, folks, if my kid was scared, I'd stab him.  That's kind of tough fucking to defend.  I hope someone could come up with a tape of him doing this exact joke somewhere else.  Yeah, see what it is.  Because I just have a feeling I've heard that before.  And then if I had a gay son, he went on, I would love him just as much as if he was 
[00:32:30]  straight, I might have to try to love even more, because I know of the difficulty that  he would have in society.  Wow.  Tracy seems like the type of guy that would love his kid no matter what.  He doesn't seem like he'd care.  That, I feel, is the real Tracy.  Regretful, Morgan explained, of all the sicknesses, there's probably none more abusive than homophobia.  My heart is committed to giving everyone the same rights that I deserve for myself.  I don't care if you love the same sex as long as you have the ability to love someone. 
[00:33:00]  I think the worst part of having a, if you had a gay son, would be the fact that when  he's in high school, you wouldn't get those hot girls coming over for the pool party.  Because you hear from fathers all the time going like, oh God, my son's starting to  bring home these girls, and they're fucking beautiful, I don't know what to do, I'm freaking  out.  You'd be so weird.  And you'd just be like, Jesus Christ.  Oh, hi Brad, hi Scott.  Wouldn't be bad if they were twinks, but if you like bears, you'd be like, God, you have 
[00:33:30]  to bring home the fucking, he's a linebacker.  Where's the cabana?  Couldn't you like slender guys?  I said the worst part would be having to go to some weird pizza party, you know what  I mean?  Because now you've got to kind of be accepting and kind of show up.  Oh, there it is.  I mean, obviously for a dad, it would be a little awkward.  You know, that's, that you could say without any repercussions, because it probably is  very awkward.  I think it, I think it, from a selfish point of view, yeah, just missing out on those fucking 
[00:34:00]  nubile bodies in bikinis jumping in your fucking backyard pool.  Wow.  I think, I think every father that has a son, I really, this is a blanket statement, but  it's in the back of your mind.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean.  Would I be accepting?  Abso-fucking-lutely.  But you're sitting there, I'm already looking for signs, like, I'm not, that's just how  it is to be a father.  Yeah, that, to me.  You're not going to change that in me.  Is real, realistic. 
[00:34:30]  Can I be, can I be accepting if it turns out?  Yes.  But right, I'm already looking like, all right, he's not picking up any dolls.  Yes.  Let's see, does he go for the sneakers or the high heels?  Yes.  Playing with, playing with the parents' shoes, let's see.  Yay, the sneakers.  He went with the sneakers.  And Tracy took that, that thought that pretty much every father has, pretty much, I'm sure  somebody will call it.  Took it to the umpteenth level.  Yes.  Yes.  But you really think that shit.  But I would think, yeah, I would think fathers, and seeing how much comedy is made, and it's 
[00:35:00]  allowed, if it's very basic like that, about fathers and gay sons and how they're dealing  with it, and what they got to do, and the awkward moments, because that is, that does  make for funny comedy.  I think that is kind of an accepted thing, that yes, the father will be uncomfortable.  The family will have to go through certain things, and mentally, to deal with the situation.  But, you know, and then you can take Tracy, and it's like, stab him in the chest, or shoot  him in the head, all right, that's taking it way to the, to the edge of the, the level. 
[00:35:30]  But, how was he saying it?  It really is a difference, and it's funny, on Red Eye last night, the woman, one of the  women who I was, I was on with, she was nice, but she was saying something about how, like,  great comedians always know where the line is, and I said, but I, but I, but that to  me is such a common misconception.  Yeah, they don't.  And I said, I was, I was like, Richard Pryor and Carlin lived over the line, Kenison was  a genius, he lived on the other side of the line, Bill Cosby does not, Seinfeld does not, 
[00:36:00]  they're also great comics.  You don't have to, but don't say because somebody does, that they don't understand what great  comedy, that, that, but that's, that thought right there, sums up what so many people feel  about comedy.  Well, a great comedian doesn't need to use that kind of light, it doesn't have to be anti-gay,  it could be just, you're pussy jokes.  A good comedian, people always have this thing, a good comedian, dot, dot, dot.  They always have, and you, how about you just love Brian Regan, and you love Otto and  George, can't you just love both of them, instead of fucking, finding out why one is 
[00:36:30]  more valid than the other, it's so frustrating.  Right, they're both very important, as far as.  Trust me, nuts.  As far as wanting to laugh.  Unbelievable.  The comedian continued by speaking out against the controversial don't ask, don't tell  policy that Congress repeated last year, saying they got him for everything.  They repealed it last year, right?  Yeah, you should have the right, no matter who you are, to protect and serve our country.  So they gave him a whole list of things, we want, because, because, Glad knows everyone's  going to pick this, this up.  Yeah.  I mean, they're going to get a lot of, a lot of info out there. 
[00:37:00]  That's exactly, what you just said right there, is exactly.  So they're holding our hostage, that's why I'm, every case is exactly what you just said.  They know it's going to be picked up.  Right.  They said, this person says it, everyone picks it up.  So Tracy Morgan, just to summarize, he apologizes for something that might have offended some  people, it should have ended there, even though I don't even agree, you should apologize,  but then they grab you, they hold you hostage, and they basically give you a whole bunch of  bullet points to comment on, and then guess what, the mainstream media and everyone just  picks it up.  What they say is, look, we'll allow you to keep your career, we'd like to borrow you 
[00:37:30]  and use you as a bullhorn for a few days if we can.  That's perfect.  Do you mind if we use you as a bullhorn?  But they, how could, as people with so many different ideologies, whether it's gays or  racist or women's groups or Catholicism or Islam, how can every one of them behave exactly  the same way?  It is amazing.  That is one thing that all societies agree on.  When someone fucks up, use them as a bullhorn for what you'd like them to say.  No matter what the group is, you're right.  They all do it.  Because I'm sure GLAAD is putting out these statements almost on a regular basis, but no one's 
[00:38:00]  picking it up.  No one hears it until someone fucks up.  Until someone fucks up and then they're like, oh, now we get to really be heard.  It's almost like a heckle.  They have silence in the room and they're the one who wants to yell out, bullshit, while  the comedian's on.  You know, you brought up Seinfeld, a clean comedian, Seinfeld, known as a clean comedian  and stuff like that.  I was watching an episode last night, it was the suicide, it was about this guy who was  in a coma trying to commit suicide because it was a chick wanting to leave him and stuff. 
[00:38:30]  And there were so many suicide jokes being made and Jerry was like saying a few.  It's like, what is that with the, they were talking about Dr. Kevorkian and he goes, what's  with a suicide machine?  Aren't there any tall buildings around still?  He goes, why can't people just wrap their lips around a revolver like everybody?  Like, I mean, and that shit to people that know people that have committed suicide, mental  health things, a suicide hotline, things like that would upset them to the point where that  would make Jerry like, hey, you know, hey, that's over the line. 
[00:39:00]  And then his whole thing at the end where he does his little stand up at the end of the  show was on suicide.  And, you know, it's like, how come people that commit suicide, they try and they fail  and then they just give up.  Right.  It's like, you know, give it a try.  Keep trying.  If you can't start your car in the garage, get a tune up.  I would love it.  Like he just was going off on killing yourself.  And it would have been very offensive to suicide.  And why is it okay? 
[00:39:30]  I don't know.  We know why it's okay.  But why is it okay?  As I was watching that one too.  That's pretty brutal shit.  There's a lot of people listening to us right now that have been affected by suicide.  Absolutely.  Dude, I know six comedians that have killed themselves.  Yeah.  Six.  Six.  Really?  Six comics.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Wow.  As I was watching that though, I did realize, I went, you know, this is one I don't really  see that much on television because it was on DVD.  And I'm like, I don't see this one on TV that much.  And I'm wondering if they just pulled that one like, eh, we don't have to play that one. 
[00:40:00]  We have enough to play, so why don't we just show this one?  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  But you do see how it's like, it all depends on who complains.  Because the suicide, there's no real powerful voice because no one's defending people's  right to commit suicide.  So there's no suicide voice, if that makes any sense, because they're not being discriminated  against.  So they don't have a special interest group.  It'll just be people piping up here and they're all willy nilly.  And you might not like it, but that's why every single fucking person listening to our 
[00:40:30]  voices today should push back.  Oh, yeah.  Even if you're a gay guy that was offended by what Tracy Morgan said.  Now you're telling gay guys to push back.  Look, I'm not going to sit here while you make jokes during this sensitive time.  Good point.  Because we've said on this show, it's only gay if you push back.  You're right.  No need to get us all lathered up.  Push back.  Oops.  Push back.  Oopsie.  But everyone should be pushing back because they're never accepted. 
[00:41:00]  Because it's not going to, they're going to go after your little group next, you dummies.  Even if you're offended.  We've been saying that for years.  Yes.  It sucks you're a little offended.  But, you know, think of, think of the overall thing here.  You're going to lose some, some funny shit out there.  To me, that's when people are really fighting for each other's, and it's not as dramatic  as, uh, I'll die if you're right to say it.  It's nothing that melodramatic.  I wonder how many people really mean that.  But.  Look, I don't agree with what you say, but I'll protect it with my life. 
[00:41:30]  You're right to say it.  It's like, really?  Would you?  I don't think you would.  How about this?  How about a compromise?  I may not agree with what you say, but I won't try to ruin your career for saying it.  Yeah, there you go.  You don't have to throw your own neck out there on the train track.  I'm not going to hang myself.  Yeah.  But I'm not going to hold your head down there either.  I may not agree with what you say, but go ahead.  Yeah, but go ahead.  That's all I want out of America.  I may not agree with what you say. 
[00:42:00]  Fuck it.  Say it anyway.  Go ahead.  I'm alive.  You're alive.  Go ahead.  Who was the uninformed woman on Red Eye last night?  I don't know.  That's someone that's uninformed.  I don't know if she was a strategist or whatever.  I have not done the show with her, no.  Okay.  But what she said was not, it bothered me, but I wasn't annoyed at her because I've heard  that a million times.  It's a very, very common feeling with comedy.  And I want to take a gamble here is that a lot of the people who are offended, not just  members of GLAAD, but even people who didn't vocalize their offense, or Amanda Tracy, are 
[00:42:30]  the same ones that would have said, you're an idiot if you wanted to censor what Robert  Mapplethorpe did as an artist and as a painter, who a lot of people felt was way over the line  and was way offensive.  But Robert Mapplethorpe could say, look, this is why I do this.  This is my art.  And a lot of gay people would absolutely defend him as they should, but those people will  abandon Tracy.  And you know what?  A lot of the blacks defending Tracy, like you said, abandon Imus. 
[00:43:00]  It's this fucking phone.  It's a game of hot potato in this country with free speech.  It is when you're saying something that is bothering me, I'm going to fucking grab the  potato and scream at your face.  Oh, I don't know why you'd hold a potato in hers.  We obsess about the Imus thing, because when the Imus thing was going down, black radio  stations, when it's right, it's right.  This is what happened.  Black radio stations were applauding, jumping up and down.  They were loving it.  What are you, dumb? 
[00:43:30]  And we're sitting there like, you idiots.  They're going to go after you next.  You're next, dummy.  What are you doing?  You're absolutely right with Mapplethorpe, though.  So a lot of gays would look at that and be like, hey, he's got the right to show his  art.  It's art.  And not only were they defending him, but they were way, way far against people that  were against him.  Like they were condemning everybody that was against Mapplethorpe. 
[00:44:00]  Saying, oh, you close minded fucking conservative shithead.  Right.  And it's like, wait a minute.  You're doing the same exact thing when you try to stick up for what you believe in and  people hate you for it.  Well, like the same people that said that I disagreed with Giuliani when he went after  that art in the Brooklyn Museum of Art.  Yeah.  What does he know about art?  None of his business.  Right.  When it was painted with dung, but that really meant something to Africans.  That wasn't some slam on the Virgin Mary.  Right.  The religious groups got very offended.  I like the dogs playing poker. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  That's the one I like.  Did he say that?  No.  That would be funny.  I still have.  He should.  But people said, I guarantee you that there were not a lot of gay groups that agreed  with him.  They probably like, oh, like you said, a conservative asshole.  What are you talking about?  But now it's there.  You're either for it or against it.  I think DL said about, DL Hughley said about, I miss, it's a zero sum game free speech.  And DL is a great example of a guy who kind of shits on everything and who I've never heard  complain about what another guy has said. 
[00:45:00]  That was just a good way to phrase it.  Either you're for everybody saying what they want or you're not.  Right.  There's no fucking middle ground.  I know the difference between yelling fire in a movie theater and doing humor.  I know the difference.  And we all know the difference.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm battling.  No, you're not.  It gets back.  It's fucking true.  It gets back to Tracy.  So Morgan Stevens' apologies was aimed at the victims of homophobic bullying who he reportedly  told to stop whining during his heavily criticized act.  Stop whining.  You've been in a million comedy clubs.  How many people whine? 
[00:45:30]  Oh, you think?  Don't know because I don't know what his fan base is now.  I'd say 10, 15 years ago it was just Tracy.  But he attracts, Tracy gets a lot of walkouts on stage because he's harsh.  And he's got a lot of 30 rock people coming out.  A lot of 30 rock people.  A lot of movie people.  A lot of them cop out.  Oh, that's true.  So his fan base is not what it was.  They're a little bit more mainstream now.  Double-edged sword, that whole thing.  You get the popularity.  You're selling a lot of tickets.  But then you've got to deal with the people that are like, ah, who is this guy?  What I am most sad about is the comments I made about kids and bullying. 
[00:46:00]  This is the last statement.  He said, I would never want any young person to think that I wasn't on their side.  And if any young person thinks they can bully a young kid, come see me at 30 rock.  On the corner.  I'd be happy to meet you.  That'd be fun.  Or Brooklyn if you can't make it to Manhattan.  So we understand why he's going through all this.  But it's unfortunate that we as a society are making people do this.  But if that's the way he really feels, as a comic, I would say, well, then shame on you.  You should fucking shame on you. 
[00:46:30]  But you should convey that in your act.  Like Nana.  But you know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Tracy's a funny enough guy.  If that's how you really feel, then you should kind of be conveying that in your act.  It's like Bill Cosby, who I think is brilliant.  And Cosby does all this family value stuff, but he has a lot of very harsh opinions on it.  And on black people talking a certain way.  You can't be a doctor talking like he should convey that on stage.  Not necessarily just when off stage.  Fucking bring that on stage.  Right.  You can do that and be clean.  People just like my filth flarn, filth flarn bits. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, yeah.  Filth and flarn.  Who's he putting?  Ugh, right.  Does he have a book coming out?  We're trying to get Bill Cosby.  I'd love to get him.  Does he?  Really?  Yeah.  He's a weird guy.  I told you me and my girlfriend went to see him in the fucking Borgata.  He just brought us backstage and talked for a half hour.  Oh, shut up, Bill.  And another couple came in.  Shut up, Bill.  I was like, all right, Bill, I'm going to watch the show.  Oh, you are the show.  Oh, I just wanted a picture with you, Bill.  Jesus.  I'm stuck here with you?  But he was so fucking interesting, dude.  He was a really Cosby.  I would imagine he would be.  Yeah.  He's had a fucking life and a career, man. 
[00:47:30]  Fuck yeah, man.  Pryor used to steal from him.  Very, very interesting guy.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  He wanted to be, and Pryor said there was room for one meeting a black guy like that,  and Pryor wanted it to be him, and he conked his hair and fucking did Cosby-like material  on Sullivan, and it was never quite what Cosby was doing.  Wow.  So then he just became his own person.  Yeah, he walked off stage.  I think the Aladdin, and they walked off, couldn't handle it anymore, and he went into  the Red Foxes Club and the Black Clubs and Mooney and Emily and all these fucking  hardcore black rumors, and he just... 
[00:48:00]  If you watch Richard Pryor live and smoking in 1971 at the Improv here in New York, he's  bombing.  He's bombing because the audience is not ready for it, but it's really great.  He's smoking, and he's just got all this fucking...  He's talking about black militants, and no one talked about that in 71, except in black  clubs.  Right.  And he was filming it, and he was complaining that it wasn't getting the laughs, but 10  years later, they released it.  It did so poorly, but he admits sucking a dick.  He admits, you know, and he had sex with a gay guy. 
[00:48:30]  He's like, I fucked a faggot.  He said, never fuck a faggot, because they will tell.  He admitted that.  It was harsh to say like that, but Pryor admitted that in 1971, I'd say.  Wow.  Damn.  Yeah, that's probably not going to get...  That's probably going to get a lot of people just staring blankly and scared.  It's the fucking...  I'm uncomfortable with that.  Yeah, yeah.  Talked about his mother being a hooker.  The greatest fuck...  It's my favorite stand-up, even though it didn't...  You watched it 10 years later, what it became. 
[00:49:00]  What was it called?  Richard Pryor, Live and Smoking.  And he bombed...  It's like 35 minutes.  I'm going to check it out.  It's at the Improv here in New York.  Live and Smoking.  I do remember when that came out.  That was much later.  It came out in 81.  81?  After Live and Concert had been released in 79 or 80, and it might have even been after  Sunset Strip.  Damn.  But he's just...  Oh, he's so great just standing there.  All these fucking amazing thoughts.  And I know how they turned out three years later on records.  I know the way the bits became.  It's fucking great.  Right on.  Sorry.  All right.  We should take a break. 
[00:49:30]  We started with a million things and then went with Tracy Morgan.  I'm glad we did that.  But we got the Wiener thing with Obama commenting on Wiener.  I had another odd dream.  Oh, no.  Can we save it for after the break?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got to eat.  Was it about Wiener?  Well, not...  No, I don't think so.  But I'll tell you after.  You know what?  And I'm not trying to attach myself to what you just said, but I had an odd dream too.  Did you have an odd one?  And I don't have a lot of odd dreams. 
[00:50:00]  I think I became Jimmy in my dream.  Oh, jeez.  But I mean...  Really?  Yeah.  Do you find you like certain things you didn't think you'd like?  No, not that bad.  I became a picture-taking idiot.  Oh, you did?  I might want to rephrase that as a guy who likes pictures.  I became a guy who likes photos.  How about a sweet guy who enjoys a photo now and again?  Now and again.  I became a fucking closet queer who enjoys pictures and has no chin and fat tits.  No offense, Jimmy.  Sorry, Jimmy. 
[00:50:30]  That's accurate.  I didn't say that wrong.  I'm a picture-taking idiot.  I became a zilch.  You know what?  This isn't fair because you said you have a dream, so mine's quick.  I was obsessing with taking a picture with Jack Nicholson.  Oh, well, that would be...  At some weird...  I don't even know where the fuck I was.  And he was trying to hide.  And I kept stalking him until I got a picture.  Wow.  And he was crouched down on a curb hiding behind a guy.  It was some kind of obscure film festival or something that I just happened to.  Yeah, some kind of thing, Jimmy thing. 
[00:51:00]  But I wasn't invited there.  I just happened to be on vacation or something.  And I just happened to be in the area where this big, huge thing was going on.  And I didn't think much of myself that I would actually be invited.  I just happened to be there.  And now I'm like, holy shit, that's Jack Nicholson.  I got to get a picture.  I got to get a picture.  And I was obsessing about it.  And it was the Jack Nicholson from The Shining.  It wasn't current day...  Oh, wow.  The good old, older Jack.  It wasn't current day Jack.  Or younger Jack.  And then finally I got a picture as he turned to look at me with those evil fucking shining  eyes of his, all pissed off. 
[00:51:30]  And then all of a sudden my alarm went off.  I'm like, fuck, I want to know what happened.  I hate that when you have to wake up.  Yeah, but that's the only reason...  It sounds so cool.  But the wake up is the only reason why you remember the dream in the first place.  Although I'm glad I woke up from last night's one.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I wanted no more of that.  I can't wait.  Hey, here's Johnny.  I'm doing some impressions, by the way.  I'll be doing them tomorrow night at the Anti-Social Comedy Tour.  I close with a good Nicholson.  I say, picture Jack Nicholson, if he were Anthony Wiener.  And I go, had you like to see my Wiener? 
[00:52:00]  Here's my Wiener.  That is good.  Wendy, here's my underwear.  I do a whole rant on Nicholson.  It's so good.  I can't wait to check that out.  I'm the Joker in the Batman.  Here's my Wiener.  It is like it.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  Sure it is.  Hey, are you guys here in the Cuckoo's Nest, the Wieners? 
[00:52:30]  Ah, see, you add in the movie names so people really, you know, drive it home.  Nice.  I played the Wolfman, Harry like the Wolf Wiener.  Here's Johnny.  Here's my dick.  Here's my dick.  Hey, am I leaking gas or is someone having fucking eggs?  I have eggs.  And hopefully you're leaking gas so we can get our food and our hormones together.  I was getting a little nervous there.  All right.  You're eating eggs.  Good.  All right.  Anthony's Dream next.  Sirius XM, the virus. 
[00:53:00]  It's not the same like it was.  Erectile dysfunction has become a serious epidemic.  Pussy is over.  Don't mean nothing no more.  I can't get a hard on.  Take it from legendary comedian and ED sufferer Pat Cooper.  It's no joke.  I'm not making this shit up.  You're with that gorgeous muffa and you're in bed and it don't happen.  Happened to me.  And she goes, what's the matter?  I said, I think it's erectile dysfunction.  She goes, what's that?  I'm fucking dead. 
[00:53:30]  She goes, you mean you can't get it up?  Medication isn't the only option.  I tried Cialis.  I tried Viagra.  I tried everything.  I'm fucking dead.  If you or someone you know is suffering from erectile dysfunction, contact your physician to explore alternative medical treatments.  I swear to you, I went to a urologist.  He says, how do you feel?  I said, my big thrill is peeing.  I said, when I was getting laid, I said, go, ah, ah.  Now that I pee, I go, ah, ah, ah.  It's the same fucking thing.  It wouldn't have cost me a dime.  Just take it from Pat Cooper. 
[00:54:00]  Don't buy into the erectile dysfunction hype.  Fuck all the bullshit.  Your penis no longer works.  Life as you know it is over.  The doctor said to me, you're fucking dead.  I'm fucking dead.  Serious XM.  The virus.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  How does it feel?  How does it feel?  To be without a home? 
[00:54:30]  Like a complete unknown.  Like a rolling stone.  Is this a coming back from the first break, thematic reason why this song is playing thing?  Because that's become kind of a thing, I noticed.  Well, it's 46 years ago today that Bob Dylan recorded this little ditty. 
[00:55:00]  Dylan, thumbs up or down?  Sometimes thumbs up, sometimes thumbs way down.  Why sometimes way down?  I don't know.  I like this stuff where it's pseudo-melodic like this.  I don't mind this.  Like subterranean homesick blues?  No.  You don't?  You don't?  Not really.  You're a tough guy.  Yeah.  I like Bob Dylan.  I even like that dumb one where it doesn't sound like him at all. 
[00:55:30]  Lady, lady, lady, lady, lady, lay across my big breast bed.  It doesn't sound like him at all.  It's pretty weird that that sound.  And then his voice gets all weird.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't mind.  I like Dylan.  But sometimes where he's just going, I can't take it.  Well, that's live Dylan.  Get me out of here.  Live Dylan.  No, thank you.  I'm done with that.  I like him.  I have a, what do I like a lot?  The House of the Rising Sun. 
[00:56:00]  I like his version of that.  He does a version of that, yeah?  I think he wrote the motherfucker.  I think he did, yeah.  I think it's his song.  Did he write that?  I'm pretty sure he did.  That's right.  Something happened the other day with Bill Burr.  He tweeted, he goes, Neil Diamond is doing a cover of Red Red Wine.  And it was good up to the part where he's got to, like, talk or something.  And I just wrote, Bill, he wrote the fucking song.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Neil Diamond wrote Red Red Wine?  Wrote Red Red Wine.  That's his fucking song. 
[00:56:30]  I didn't know that.  But it's funny when you think, like, he did a cover of this and it blows.  Right.  It's like, oh, he wrote the motherfucker.  Well, that's, I think that happens a lot.  Yeah, like Bobby McGee.  Well, these artists, they go, ah, here, you can have this song.  And then it becomes a huge hit.  And they're like, wait, I wrote that.  So they want to make it a hit themselves.  It's like, nah, you're now just doing a cover of the original.  Chris Christopherson, I think, did Bobby McGee.  Yeah, he wrote that.  No.  Yes, he did.  Yeah, Chris Christopherson wrote Bobby McGee.  Why don't I know any of this shit?  Isn't that sick?  And the original, I Will Always Love You, Dolly Parton. 
[00:57:00]  Great tune that Whitney made a huge of.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I prefer Dolly's version, actually.  Wait, who wrote that?  Dolly Parton.  Dolly.  Did I know?  I'll always love you.  And I, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi.  As she's sweating like a pig.  Boy, can she sweat.  Yeah, well, if you're on, well.  Yeah, maybe.  I want to hear House of the Rising Sun by Dylan.  Origins of House of the Rising Sun unknown.  Yeah, I didn't think Dylan wrote that, man.  Dates back to 1933. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, he didn't know?  I didn't know that, but he does a version of it.  I think, uh.  Hitler used to sing that at the old fucking beer halls.  Oh, help me out.  One of the old blues artists.  I heard House of the Rising Sun.  Hold on, hold on.  Pause this for a second.  Leadbelly?  Maybe.  What the fucking Leadbelly?  Somebody that knows the blues.  There was a blues album I picked up.  I haven't fucking checked out in many, many years.  And there was a version of House of the Rising Sun on there,  but it's almost sideways.  It's a little twisted, but you can tell it's what became House of the Rising Sun. 
[00:58:00]  Old Billy Chetley?  Old Billy, what?  It could have been Bill Tetley, yeah.  Fuck, any help on that one, Ant?  No.  I want to say Leadbelly, because I got obsessed with Leadbelly for a while.  Oh!  This is Leadbelly.  Rising Sun Blues.  This might be it right here.  Oh, God.  That sounds like Leadbelly guitar. 
[00:58:30]  Wow.  Damn, he must have made a lot of money from this song.  Oops.  I like Leadbelly.  Guys and Sun Blues, huh?  It's pretty much the same song.  Yes.  You sold the song for some pork and beans. 
[00:59:00]  You know what?  It probably was.  Probably.  And an old dog or something. 
[00:59:30]  Good old heady Leadbetter.  Are you done with this?  It only has one more verse.  I like this.  It's all right, right?  Fuck yeah, man.  I got obsessed with Leadbetter for a little bit.  I'm going back to New Orleans.  My race is almost running.  I'm going back to spend the rest of my life.  I'm going to need a ride in a jungle. 
[01:00:00]  Well, his songs are all short, too.  Good Night, Irene, I think is his.  Fucking, there's so many songs.  He actually influenced Anal Cunt on the length of their songs.  That was fun yesterday.  I don't know what that sounded like out there.  It's a pisser.  You know what?  So Leadbetter, you know, and then he gets ripped off there.  But the Animals version of that song is so fucking great, right?  Yeah.  I don't think that's a great sounding song.  No, I like that.  I like Dylan's version, too, man. 
[01:00:30]  It's cool because it's dirty and old and all that crap.  But it's not, it doesn't sound like the Animals, man, where you get into that shit.  How does the Animals sound?  I just want a moment of it.  I don't know if I like Dylan's, but.  Yeah, this is great.  They really fucked this shit up.  And look, they look like the Beatles when they say it.  Yeah.  I mean, it's our house in the U.S.  They call the rising sun.  That's how a bunch of white boys do it. 
[01:01:00]  That is good.  And it's been ruined.  It's like Jimmy Fallon.  He was one fucked up individual.  Who was that?  What the fuck's his name?  Yeah, fucking hell.  Look at this horrible video.  How all the guitar players are walking off screen one by one.  They're all wearing ties.  Terrible lip syncing.  Put on Dylan's.  I think the Animals is better, but listen to Bob Dylan's version. 
[01:01:30]  I do like it.  There's a house down in New Orleans.  Look at people who did this.  It's doing more like Lead Belly a little bit.  Yeah, I like this version a lot.  I like this too, Jimmy.  I don't think I've ever heard this.  I can barely hear his vocals.  It's in your left ear.  Is your left ear done?  Is your left ear done?  Oh my God.  Hold on.  Yeah.  It's hard to hear. 
[01:02:00]  Did he get smashed in the head with a kettlebell?  Wait, he's not right there.  There was a tailor.  You can't hear his vocals.  She sold these new blue jeans.  It's so low.  It does sound low.  You've got to get your hands.  My sweetheart was a gambler.  Yours was out of phase. 
[01:02:30]  You're not deaf.  I thought I had some kind of a swimmer on my cock.  I just put Ant's headphones on and you can't hear the vocals with his headphones.  I wonder what the deal is.  It's extremely, extremely low in the background.  Very low.  I thought we just found out that you're missing an ear.  I'm a might bit deep.  That's a terrible version.  That's Eric Burton now?  Wow.  He don't look like that kid no more.  Why does it sound so bad? 
[01:03:00]  That's not the good version of it.  That's the copy that's in the line here.  Okay, why is it coming in one ear?  Hey, fuck you, Jimmy.  That's what he just said.  No, he's right, though.  I only got in one ear.  Yeah, it's out of phase.  It's a great version.  Yeah, I like it.  So Dylan recorded Like a Rolling Stone 46 years ago today.  That's why that.  And speaking of the...  Do you like his version of All Along the Watchtower?  Which I know he wrote.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's a perfect example that...  I bet you he wishes he never gave that one to Hendrix.  That thing is a fucking monster for Hendrix. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, wait.  My phones weren't plugged in all the way.  Hold on, hold on.  You want to hear it again?  Yeah, just put it on real quick.  No, you're not deaf, though.  Let me see.  How about hurry up and put it on?  Some lollygagging.  There is a house  where I live.  Let's hear it.  Oh, Christ.  Blazing.  Now you can hear it? 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  All right, that makes sense.  What a dickbag I am.  What a dickbag I am.  Does Dylan still do his radio hour?  Hey, this is Bob Dylan Radio hour.  Oh, it's serious, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's real.  What happened with that deal?  That's what this XM was made for.  That Dylan show was great.  It was probably a three-month, $80 billion deal. 
[01:04:30]  If my house was at a rising sun, I would probably only want to go there in the shade.  Get an awning.  What the fuck?  Looks at me all angry.  Only if you're tired.  That's not awning.  No, yawning.  I still can't get our channel in my new car.  And I just, it's too much of a hassle to work it out.  Yeah, I can't get it in my Mustang.  So I decided just not to have our channel in my car.  Me either.  And the live feed, or the feed, the internet feed goes out every day. 
[01:05:00]  It's like clockwork.  Yep.  But every other channel works.  Wow, you know what?  Let me do this for you right now.  Oh, you don't have to.  I went through it.  Nope.  It was a thousand tweets.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I want to acknowledge everyone that tweeted us about the online feed going out.  Read them.  And this is what I wrote.  Thanks for letting me know online feed is down.  Told the bosses, bosses in quotations, who will fix it in quotations.  And say that it's not an ongoing problem, even though I know it is. 
[01:05:30]  That's what I tweeted, right?  Here's the second half of that.  So I get an email from the boss.  Remember what I just wrote, right?  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  That's the audible problem.  There's an audible problem, too.  Nope.  That's an audible problem.  Is the stock market shit in the bed right now a little bit?  Oh.  Yeah, we're below 12,000.  Here it is.  Oh, what happened? 
[01:06:00]  So you heard my tweet, and this is what I get back from, quotations, the boss.  The boss.  I got audio when I tuned in, but have called engineering and the web team to find out if  there was an issue.  If there was an issue.  I'm like, no, there was an issue.  I'm telling you there was an issue.  Our fans are telling us there's an issue.  Don't say if there's an issue.  I'm going to give out their email so they deal with this.  Oh, that'll be good.  Because every time the online feed goes out, it blows up all our Twitters.  Yeah.  And then I tell these people, and they don't think it's a problem. 
[01:06:30]  There's something going on.  We're going to see if there's a problem.  No, there's a fucking problem.  Supposedly, yesterday, we were the only channel that wasn't on.  It's always that.  It was dead air.  When it goes out, it's always just our channel.  I never fucking go to tune into, you know, fucking lithium or the 80s channel or anything  like that.  And it's like, oh, look, it's dead.  Nothing's playing.  But our dumb channel, all the time.  The online feed, I get so many complaints about.  But yeah, can I say this?  The web, whatever's going on with the web team here, it stinks. 
[01:07:00]  It stinks.  Don't I?  I don't want to say this.  How do we have satellites circling the Earth, but they can't get the online shit right?  Yeah, the online shit.  Well, I want to write this down.  How about you fix it?  Or you fire who can't Mars?  Kidding.  I don't know if it's Mars.  I just want them out.  This is what I wonder, but I don't want to say it out loud. 
[01:07:30]  No?  Well, what does that have to do with our feed networking?  Then fair enough.  Then it's definitely a problem.  Yeah, it's a huge problem.  All right.  Well, whatever.  I'm sure they're working on that.  Like, they're working on getting us interns.  Oh, wait.  We got an answer here, maybe.  Answer man.  Hi, Mars.  Hi, Mars.  Hi, Jim.  Thanks for your thoughts, but it has nothing to do with me.  Yeah, I was hoping it would be your responsibility.  It's a third-party company that takes care of that.  Oh, they stink.  How much of a party.  They stink.  Why is it only our channel? 
[01:08:00]  Or so it seems, according to a lot of listeners.  I didn't know it was only our channel.  I thought it was, I only take care of our channel.  I don't give a fuck about the other channel.  So, they farm it out to a third party?  Yes, sir.  Why don't they do their own fucking internet stuff?  Yes, I'm working on it.  Yes, sir.  This is serious.  The feed's down again.  I'm trying to put a logo on sound.  Well, actually, I was talking about the BlackBerrys and the iPhones.  The online feed. 
[01:08:30]  I really don't know who takes care of that.  I guess it's the web team.  Well, thanks for coming in.  Exactly.  Clearing that up.  Exactly.  I'd love to get that minute back.  But when people tweet, they should tell you where the problem lies.  How about they tweet you at all that?  Exactly.  Well, they're not going to assess the problem and troubleshoot it.  They're going to say, I tuned into the online feed and nothing's coming out.  As a customer, it's not their responsibility to troubleshoot. 
[01:09:00]  I know, but when we get the trouble calls, we don't know if it's the iPhone or the BlackBerry or the online feed.  It's every online feed that they have.  I would assume with the volume of people complaining that it's across the board.  It's everything except one particular phone.  Yeah, what's coming out of their satellite radio that they bought.  Well, why don't we talk to our listeners for a second?  You guys got to troubleshoot the problem.  Yeah, troubleshoot it.  Please.  Could you do that?  Could you run a diagnostic on the entire system and then send it personally to Mars? 
[01:09:30]  And acknowledge the SiriusXM flowchart, which is now hanging proudly on our door.  Love the flowchart.  Do we have a problem?  Yes.  Or is it the other thing?  Did we do good?  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  Arrow.  See, I did another way.  What the fuck is that about?  Sam put up, fire this guy with an arrow pointing.  And as I look at the monitor, the arrow's pointing at Mars.  That's correct.  Just because you want the listeners to troubleshoot the problem.  Well, if they're already complaining, they should add a little step and just say what platform they're complaining from. 
[01:10:00]  That's true.  I mean, it's not true.  It's just a pack of lies.  Of course it's not.  All right.  So the listeners will troubleshoot and they will solve the problem.  What do you want them to do after they troubleshoot the problem?  Yeah.  Fix it.  Run a complete diagnostic.  And then you want them to fix it themselves?  Maybe get some tiny tools out and get inside their own phones and try to rewire it or something?  I don't know.  Get their tiny tools out.  Their tiny tools.  Well, I was thinking engineering. 
[01:10:30]  That's absolutely like someone going to the doctor and saying, I have a pain in my side.  And the doctor says, okay, cut yourself open.  Look for something.  And then give me a little more info.  But cut yourself open with those tiny little tools.  Yes.  Tiny little tools.  Fuck you, Jim.  Little tiny tools.  It's a little Don Ho song.  Tiny tools.  Tiny tools.  We got little pump bucks.  I really suck.  I really suck. 
[01:11:00]  We were doing some wiener thing.  And then we got...  Were we?  Yeah.  Then we went off road with the Tracy Morgan.  Because the wiener thing is just as ridiculous.  Because now he's in rehab for sexual addiction.  Well, they're not really saying, right?  They're not saying...  Like, no one really knows what he's doing.  But apparently it's for two weeks.  Two weeks.  Two weeks.  And like...  Two weeks.  Maybe he went to Mars.  Maybe they're saying like two weeks is long enough for him to get treatment for whatever  problem this is. 
[01:11:30]  Like, what is the problem?  I think it's like you said.  He just...  He's not a marriable guy.  There's no problem.  This is what he wants to be doing.  What's wrong with wanting to do this?  Look at him grabbing that dick.  You know, he wants to do this and be married.  I guess that's obviously the problem.  Yeah.  But now you got Obama saying, look, if it was me, I would resign.  And like I said, if you love him or hate him, you don't want the president talking about  you.  No.  And this should be enough for this guy to now like...  To just resign.  To step down.  Now you got the president talking about you. 
[01:12:00]  The Democrats are having a closed door meeting, too, today about him.  Yeah.  And you know it's not going to be like, well, let's...  We'll have him stay.  They're trying to figure out how to get him out of there now, right?  They'll all say, you know, give him a chance.  He's a good guy.  And then they'll get to the last guy and they'll go, well, I take the chance.  But what does it come down to?  Can they run you out of there?  Yeah.  How?  It's a process.  It is, though, right?  So he could stay in there.  He could definitely stay in there, but I think it would be more detrimental to his career. 
[01:12:30]  He could stay in there and the Democrats, and he wouldn't look like a team player at all.  But they have to investigate it, though, right?  There's got to be an investigation before they...  Yeah, I think they got enough...  I think they got enough shit on an ethical...  For ethical reasons.  And they could throw his ass out of there.  This guy scares me.  Just because of the look he's making in those pictures.  He'll hire her.  That's the most bothersome part of this.  Yeah, it's the bitches.  The bitches got to worry.  Yeah, but that look is like...  The bitches got to worry.  A guy trying way too hard to look, what, sexy? 
[01:13:00]  To look mean and sexy and rugged and bad.  He's a geeky Jewish politician, and he just wants to look like a badass.  You know?  Grabbing his dick.  Grabbing his dick.  Grabbing his dick.  There he is grabbing his dick.  And, you know, trying to look all heart.  You want heart?  You never was like us.  Here's the Obama thing with that guy with the bad voice.  Obama, Bobby.  On a day when President Barack Obama traveled to North Carolina to talk about jobs, he also 
[01:13:30]  weighed in on the Twitter scandal...  Well, Twitter...  ...that is currently engulfing New York Representative Anthony Weiner.  Obama said in an interview that will air Tuesday on NBC's Today Show...  How do you know?  Future?  ...quote, I can tell you that if it was me, I would resign.  The House will be in order?  Congress turned to work Monday, but the congressman was not in his office.  I've made some mistakes.  I've acknowledged it.  Instead, after speaking to reporters over the weekend, he has reportedly gone into rehab 
[01:14:00]  at an undisclosed location for a disorder that his office hasn't publicly detailed.  On Capitol Hill, the House Ethics Committee has taken its first step towards what could  become a full-fledged investigation of the scandal if Weiner refuses to resign.  Late Monday, House lawmakers granted his request for a temporary leave of absence from his  congressional duty.  I hate this guy.  Experts say if an ethics investigation does unfold, it could last for months and get extremely 
[01:14:30]  complicated if Weiner decides to mount a full-scale defense.  I faded away like I was in social studies class.  Dude, he's a horrible boy.  He can't keep my attention.  No.  He needs the sounds in the background.  That's why.  Who knows?  He's a fucking dullard just trying to do what he'd learn in broadcast school.  How about you just don't...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ... 
[01:15:00]  My dick!  We're forgetting something.  Uh, I didn't forget about Anthony's dream.  Oh, yeah, my dream.  Sweetie had a nightmare.  A little dream.  It was a nightmare?  Well, you could consider it one, I guess, when you find out, like, how or where it went.  What happened?  You were chased into a diverse neighborhood?  No, it's, uh, no, no.  Those are, uh, usually the bad guys in my dreams that are trying to do me harm are white  guys, which is very odd, considering my, you know, as people call it, a paranoia. 
[01:15:30]  Uh, sure.  But, uh, no, this was, uh, more of a sex, sexual type dream.  But, um...  But it was, uh...  Sorry, Anthony and the Lakers.  It was a...  I was on the floor of the court, and they were all fucking my ass and mouth.  Jimmy, no, that isn't it.  And LeBron tried to put his dick in my mouth and missed.  No, that isn't it.  I, I was, uh, I was trying to hook up with this girl. 
[01:16:00]  And she was, uh, she was very, uh, very hot.  And, and she was kind of avoiding me.  And, um, at some time during that...  That's called a memory.  No, no, but, well, it is, believe me.  But, uh, this, this was a dream.  And, um, then I noticed I started getting a nosebleed.  And, uh, I don't get nosebleeds.  I started getting this nosebleed, and it freaked me out a little bit.  And, and I had to back off from, like, talking to the girl and trying to pick her up a little bit. 
[01:16:30]  And then this other hot girl, who may have been her sister.  Much younger sister?  We're talking.  No, I think it was an older sister, as a matter of fact.  I was originally, initially going for the younger sister.  Okay.  So it was her older sister.  Who was three.  They started, uh, uh, talking while I had the nosebleed.  And I overheard them.  And this was the part that just killed me in the dream. 
[01:17:00]  That they were talking about the threesome that they had.  With.  With.  Fucking daddy.  With.  Bobo.  No!  Yes.  What a turn.  Is two chicks.  Two of the girls.  And one I really, really was, like, attracted to and wanted to hook up with her and everything.  She got that Bobo dick.  And, and, and, and then in the dream, I'm just thinking, oh my god, wait a minute. 
[01:17:30]  These two beautiful girls, they had a threesome with Bobo.  And then I'm just trying to picture, like, one of them sucking on his fucking gnarled dick.  So small.  And, and, and like, like, why would they, why would they fuck him and I'm getting a problem.  They're working me up to a nosebleed.  No, but they were, they were not interested.  The nosebleed gave me the opportunity to, like, say, oh, hold on, I'll, I'll be right with you. 
[01:18:00]  And they started talking.  That got me, like, out of, out of range.  They thought I couldn't hear them or something.  And they started talking about their threesome with Bobo.  That guy.  That guy.  Look at Bobo's bag.  What does that mean, that dream?  That's so weird.  That's an odd one, isn't it?  I just think it's a bunch of jumbled people in my head.  I don't know.  We got people that.  A mixer.  A dreamy mixer.  We got people that read dreams.  Maybe somebody.  Yeah, we always have someone that reads these goddamn dreams. 
[01:18:30]  You need one of those dream catchers.  I need a dream catcher in my room?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know about that.  You think that's just the fucking, the, the goose and duck soiree at the Overlook?  Yeah, yeah.  It's kind of a bunch of things.  It's, you know, the lotto machine, whatever.  People pop up instead of the numbers and they all make a dream.  That is a fucked up dream.  It was fucked up because I was so, like, bummed.  But it was in my dream.  Once I woke up, you know, sometimes you wake up from a dream and you're still, like, bumming out from the dream.  Yeah.  I kind of, I chuckled because it was ridiculously funny. 
[01:19:00]  But in the dream, I was totally like, oh, now even if I was able to hook up with this girl,  she'd, like, fucking been with Bobo and it was just weird and, I don't know.  Bobo.  Bobo gave them both a good tooling, I guess.  No, he didn't, though.  Yeah, he didn't.  What does that mean?  I think that means that Anthony has this fear.  Yeah.  That his nose will bleed and girls he like will fuck a retard.  That's exactly what that means. 
[01:19:30]  You know, that's an abstract way of looking at that dream, Jim.  Is this, who's this?  Who's this?  Who is this?  Who is this?  No, this is a Bobo.  Who's this?  Yeah, Bobo.  This is a Bobo.  What's the name of your dog again?  I, I, I...  I got two dogs.  Rosie and Mr. Maloonigan.  Mr. Maloonigan.  What the fuck is Mr. Maloonigan?  Yeah, where did the name Mr. Maloonigan come from, Bobo? 
[01:20:00]  I don't know.  My sister came up with the name.  Did Mr. Maloon rape you?  And they said, who's been raping you?  Mr. Maloonigan.  Bobo, you're a stud in Ant's dreams.  Yeah.  You know that?  Yeah, yeah, I know.  That kind of feels a bit awkward.  Does it?  Yeah.  Why is it awkward?  I don't know.  It just feels weird because I wouldn't expect that. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, well, yeah, I don't know.  I wasn't expecting it either.  That's why it was a surprise.  But there were two really hot girls.  And apparently you had had sex with both of these girls at the same time.  A threesome.  I know that surprisingly.  Because I, that's not surprising.  That sounds like a dream, all right.  Dream, all right.  Yeah.  That's like you and Rosie and Mr. Maloonigan, right?  Yeah.  A threesome. 
[01:21:00]  One's tongue in your ass.  The other one's lapping at your balls.  I don't know about that, right?  Oh, good.  They think your dick is a begging strip?  No, in his dreams, he's actually eating the ass of Mr. Maloonigan.  And Rosie is banging pots and pans and getting on the show.  Stupid dreams.  Mr. Maloonigans.  Yeah, in my dream, you're with two girls.  And in real life, you know, you're having sex with your own brother.  Mm-hmm.  Bobo?  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  Ah, he's still there.  Now, I gotta know why, you gotta know why your sister named your dog Mr. Maloonigan.  What does Maloonigan mean?  I don't know.  She came up with the name because she says the dog looks like a little Irish man.  An Irish man.  What?  So Maloonigan is like an Irish name?  Yeah, sort of.  Yeah.  And then Mr.?  Yeah.  Like an Irish.  Hey.  All right, that makes sense.  How old is that sister of yours?  No.  My sister is gonna turn 16 in September.  Oh, okay. 
[01:22:00]  How about some nude pics?  Is 16 legal in New York?  No.  Not at all.  Hey, Bobo.  Not under any circumstances.  So Anthony was dreaming that you were having some kind of threesome, preventing him from  having a threesome.  What were you dreaming about last night?  Oh, good one.  Yeah.  I have no freaking clue what I dreamt about.  Well, how about one dream, just so we can make something out of this?  Do you remember one dream you've had?  I don't know.  There was one dream that I was at a party with a bunch of girls in some sort of mansion. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, geez.  And what happened?  Oh, nothing.  I woke up right when I was about to lose the V-card.  The V-card?  Yeah.  I know you're retarded and all, but...  No, no.  He heard that from some fucking rom-com.  Where did you hear that?  V-card.  What rom-com? 
[01:23:00]  Huh?  No, I didn't hear that anywhere.  That's just what I referred to it as.  No, you heard that somewhere, sir.  No, you heard that somewhere.  No, I didn't hear that anywhere.  You're lying.  I'm not lying.  I didn't hear that anywhere.  You're lying.  I think you're lying about that one.  You heard that from some dumb movie or TV show.  Are you lying?  No, I'm not lying.  I didn't hear that anywhere.  You're full of bunk.  Excuse my language.  Mm-hmm.  The V-card.  So you almost had sex with one of these women in the mansion, and then you woke up before 
[01:23:30]  you lost your V-card.  Yeah.  You woke up, and Mr. Maloonegan was fucking rubbing his dirty scoot asshole on his nose.  Mr. Maloonegan had an itchy asshole while Bubba was sleeping.  Mr. Maloonegan.  Yeah.  What kind of dog is Mr. Maloonegan?  He's a snoodle.  He's a snoodle.  What's a snoodle?  Snoodles are like those, those are the ones you don't, you're not allergic to, right? 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, yeah, they're hypoallergenic.  Hypoallergenic.  He knew the word that I couldn't pronounce.  That's why I said it the way I said it.  They are adorable.  They are cute.  Wow, yeah.  You know how cute Mr. Maloonegan would look with a tire track thrown?  His little eyes blinking at you like, help me, and you can't.  Poor Mr. Maloonegan.  Mr. Maloonegan has to live with a retard.  Yeah, of course.  You know how fucking annoyed Mr. Maloonegan is that everybody else gets to go out with 
[01:24:30]  their owners and listen to interesting things, and he's going, oh, you guys, fence my V-card.  Hey, hold on the line, Bobo.  We got someone that's going to interpret Ant's dream.  I don't know your name, sir.  It's Steve the Therapist from Connecticut.  Oh, Steve the Therapist.  Oh, very good.  I remember you.  Go ahead.  All righty, guys.  It's pretty simple.  Let's look at the generics.  I mean, Anthony is a guy who could pretty much get women that most guys can't. 
[01:25:00]  He's not quite Superman, but he's got the cars.  He's got the house.  And from what you guys have said over the years, he's got a pretty good-sized sausage.  Hey, my personality's nice.  Oh, yeah.  You're a good-looking guy, and you're smooth.  Now, in your dream, you're getting cock-blocked by a retard who's got a chewed-up tongue.  Are you a therapist?  Yes.  Exactly.  Could you talk a little lower so the audience understands you?  You're going way too technical here. 
[01:25:30]  Too medical.  Call him a retard.  That's not going to be good for your business, sir.  So, basically, what I would interpret this to be is this is what goes on at SiriusXM all the time.  You guys are one of the main shows, and you're constantly getting mistreated by management.  Probably, there was a situation where a show far less successful than you guys got preferential treatment that you guys didn't.  So, right. 
[01:26:00]  Gayle King, Lady Gaga interview.  So, let's say the show represents us.  The hot chick is Sirius, and the shitty show is Bobo's chewed-up dick.  Right, and you got cock-blocked by an inferior colleague at work.  That's a great way to look at it.  Wow.  That's a great way to look at it.  I don't know.  I just think I fucking, the lot of machines started throwing people around, and I just ended up. 
[01:26:30]  Well, that's not, that's, that's not unlike how it works.  What, what dreaming does, according to Freud, is it takes all these unconscious thoughts and throws them at you.  It's just a matter of interpreting them and putting them in their proper way.  Oh, damn.  Why couldn't it just be, I was thinking of, you know, hot girls, and, I don't know, I kind of got cock-blocked by Bobo for no apparent reason. 
[01:27:00]  Did you say hot girls?  Yeah.  In love?  Oh, I got a good one.  Hot girls in love.  Where's that Loverboy song?  Oh, man.  The reason is, Anthony, then guys, I didn't want to make a living.  Oh, they should have played that one.  They wanted to play hot girls in love instead of working for the weekend?  That would have been good.  That would have been good, Sam.  You blew it.  I would have wanted to hear that one.  Hot girls in love.  Dan, dan, dan.  It would be keyboard song.  Steve, the therapist might be on to something.  Thank you, Steve.  Well, Steve, great.  Yes.  Good job, boys.  Take care.  Bobo, anything else?  Because we don't want to spend too much time with you today. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, right.  I got, I got a stand-up show up coming on Thursday at 8 o'clock.  No, you don't.  You have a what?  I'm one of the acts on a stand-up show on Thursday at 8.  Broadway Comedy Club.  Who's using you?  Oh, someone's using him.  Give me a name.  No, it's just that I was asked by one of my friends.  Of course you were.  Oh, sorry, Heather.  Sorry, Heather.  I was going to say, who's opening? 
[01:28:00]  Mr. Malone again?  So Heather got you on the bill?  Yeah.  One of the comedy shows she's doing?  Yep.  All right.  Fair enough.  I hope someone tapes that.  All right.  I'll make sure someone tapes it.  Because we got a fine tape of you warming up the crowd before, who was it?  I forgot.  Ross.  Was it Ross?  Rich Ross.  I love these comedy clubs that, it's actually a bunch of, yeah, that was a good one.  I love the comedy clubs where you're walking around Times Square and people are like, hey,  live comedy, live comedy. 
[01:28:30]  And they hand out the little things.  And they're clubs that I've, and I've known quite a few comics over the years.  They're clubs that I've never heard these people ever play at.  You know, the good comics?  And the comics you've never heard of.  Yeah.  And the comics are like, who are these people?  What are those clubs?  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks.  Oh, go ahead, Jimmy.  There's one called Ha Ha.  I think it's the Ha Ha.  Is that what it's called?  I forget what it's called.  Ha Ha.  Which I'll never, ever, I walked into it after we got thrown off the air in like 2002. 
[01:29:00]  And the guy at the door was a dick to me.  I've never walked back in.  It's on like 46 or something.  What's wrong with him?  I don't know.  He's just a dick.  And then there's one that Jamie Masada used to have, but he doesn't anymore.  It's over Show World.  But I'll never, ever support that club because they wouldn't let me shoot.  I was trying to shoot something in a peep booth for my CD cover.  They wouldn't allow any cameras in there, so I would never support that club.  Wait, the comedy club still has peep boots? 
[01:29:30]  No, it's over Show World.  The building is owned by, it's not the comedy club's fault.  Oh, I thought Show World, which was an old, like, jerk-off peep show place was the comedy club.  That would be great.  You know, you fucking have the little peep thing.  It is a little bit.  A comic goes on, starts talking, and then you just stick your dick out and start just  choking your cock.  When the window opens and the waitress, you know, gives you your food that way.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:30:00]  Here's your chicken finger.  Because you're crabs, no matter what you order.  With honey mustard.  It's always crabs.  I do believe you wanted honey mustard for your chicken crabs.  Hey, Bobo, get the plug in for Heather Height.  All right, it's at Broadway Comedy Club at 8 o'clock.  The tickets are $10 at the door.  This Thursday?  Yep, this Thursday.  All right, you call us and let us know how that goes, all right?  He can plug, though.  All right.  And we look forward to another one-man band soon. 
[01:30:30]  All right, no problem.  All right, I was thinking one of these days.  You got a video of the one-man band.  Oh, really?  Do I?  Yeah.  Bye.  Will you shut up?  You guys want to hear?  We haven't played this in a while.  Bobo introing Rich Voss at the Stress Factory.  This is great.  This is really good.  Come on, everybody.  Come on up, my buddy.  Bobo on stage at the Stress Factory.  Evening, New Jersey. 
[01:31:00]  First of all, how many here screwed over a stockholder to come here tonight?  Come on, I know.  I watch CNN.  I know what's been going on.  Well, first, I'd like to introduce to you, you know him from the O.P. and Anthony Show.  He's the Jew with the right amount of stupidity and the horse of a smile.  Give it up for New Jersey's own Rich Voss.  The horse of a smile.  And then he won't leave the stage. 
[01:31:30]  So, as a friend here, you know him from the O.P. and Anthony Show.  All the way from Queen to your...  Another retard.  ...leave your hands together for the one and only Bobo, everybody.  Let him hear it.  Nice shirt, man.  Now this is the late show.  Been going out before Voss.  Nice feeling.  Good evening, New Jersey.  All right, who's here from Queens?  Who do we got here from Queens?  Oh, we got my relatives here.  We got my cousin, Mikey, who's from Queens. 
[01:32:00]  Who grew up in the same neighborhood as me.  He's now in Smith Temple, Violet.  He had to make it out of your shitty L.A.E. traffic along with, let's see, we got here my, if you're, and my uncle Willie from, from, from, from, uh, Flushing.  He made it out of your shitty traffic on L.A.E.  Believe me, it's shitty.  Those of you who don't know Long Island Expressway, it's very shitty.  The traffic, the traffic I mean.  It's like, who, who, who here came out here to screw up me and kept, who screwed over a stockholder? 
[01:32:30]  Oh, we got one that screwed over a stockholder.  I think you're probably going to end up having to get an anal rape by Bernie Madoff.  Who's brain Madoff?  A lot of people know I do that in those Robo Springsteen bits, so, who, who, who, who here is from Jersey?  I can understand Madoff with his brain, but.  He's got a good job.  Oh, that was a good one. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, that was a good one.  Why is he still on stage?  But, without further ado, give it up for the guy who, who has the right amount of stupidity and has a horse-like smile, New Jersey's own Rich Voss. 
[01:33:30]  A horse-like smile.  A horse-like smile.  He wasn't nearly as bad as I thought he was.  Oh, no, he's got the, uh, confidence there, because he's too stooped to know he stinks.  Made off of his brain.  By the way, we have another, a new flow chart.  Yeah, yeah.  It almost distracted me out of your dream thing, Anna, because Daddy walked us in in the middle of that, and I just lost it.  Well, the original flow chart, what does it say?  What does it say, Sam, again? 
[01:34:00]  It says, uh, let me grab it.  The top box.  Did we do good or something like that?  Yes.  Did we do good?  Did we do good?  So then the flow chart goes to two, um, two choices after that, yes or no.  Yeah.  Right.  And then you pick either yes or no, you did good, and then there's only one choice after that, we have a problem.  Right.  We have a problem.  So now we've got a new one.  Does the online feed work?  And then it's either yes or no.  Yeah. 
[01:34:30]  A lot of people said no, so let's go with no this time around.  Uh-huh.  So that means it goes down to cool.  Cool.  And then it's, does the online feed work?  Yes.  Cool.  They're all diamond shaped.  Right.  All these flow charts are diamond shaped.  Box at the top, box at the bottom, yes or no in between.  Cool.  So that's the new one.  I love the, uh, serious flow charts.  They did exactly, they did exactly what I said they would do yesterday.  I even tweeted.  I said, look, they will tell me there's not really an issue here.  We don't, uh, see an issue.  Really? 
[01:35:00]  It's just the same 8,000 people.  Yeah, yeah.  Complaining.  It's a joke.  They're actually joking.  They actually wrote me back and said, when I turn it on, it's working fine.  Yeah.  But we'll, we'll, uh, we'll get with the web team.  All right.  By the way, did the liquid metal host die?  Someone is tweeting that somebody.  That's what I heard.  Yeah.  Died.  Uh, yeah.  I don't think we knew him.  Mario, uh, uh, Camisonas?  Is that how you say it?  Camisonas?  I don't know him.  Troy, do you know him?  Yeah, Troy said he did.  Yeah, Troy.  I'm going to read this on Twitter. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, Troy, uh, told us before the show he knew him.  Cool guy.  31.  31?  Yeah, young kid.  What happened, Troy?  What happened, man?  I'm not sure of the exact details.  I just found out last night.  I got a text message.  But, um, yeah, he passed away yesterday.  It was, it was quite sudden, from my understanding.  I don't think I knew him.  When did he work?  When was his shift?  Uh, he was on 9 p.m. till 3 a.m. Monday through Friday, and then he did a weekend shift.  Oh, he had a lot of airtime. 
[01:36:00]  He's a big DJ on, uh, liquid metal.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's been with it, with liquid metal for years, you know, when it was a heart attack  on, uh, on, uh, Sirius.  But, yeah, it's, it's quite sad.  I really don't know too much about it.  Jose must have known him well.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we all knew him well.  I mean, he was, he was an awesome guy.  I wonder if it was, was it drugs, or you don't know?  No, no.  I don't know why you just said you don't know, and I'm asking again, do you know?  No, I, I, I believe it was a brain hemorrhage, but I'm not quite sure of the details, so.  Jesus.  Yeah, he was a young guy, too, only like 30 or 31 years old.  You just don't, a brain hemorrhage is a motherfucker, because, like, one, one minute you're, I wonder 
[01:36:30]  if you feel that at all, or if you're just talking, and you're like, dead!  Like, does it work like that when you're talking, dead!  You have a burtation, and then it's over.  It's over, Johnny.  Yeah, I think he was in a coma for a day or two, and then it just, oh, okay.  Yeah.  Wow, I had no idea.  Yeah, sorry to hear that, man.  That sucks.  Yeah.  People like the, uh, the break you did with us yesterday, with, uh, that, uh, anal cut  and all that.  Yeah, it was fun.  I bring it up, because then Sam had, uh, Roland trying to be a lead singer of one of those 
[01:37:00]  bands.  Yeah.  Oh, what the screaming.  I didn't hear this.  Uh, I wasn't listening on the way home, but I, when I went to the band, I went to the  switch over to another station, I inadvertently hit the, uh, shit, uh, hour, and, uh, I  caught this part.  Oh, okay.  Before I could hit the button again, because I hit some traffic, and I couldn't press the  button right away, so I wound up hearing it.  I gotcha.  Do we have a quick example of what Roland was trying to do?  Yeah.  Troy's.  All right, hit it.  That's Troy from yesterday. 
[01:37:30]  Yes.  Fucking Godzilla.  So Sam was trying to get Roland to do exactly that.  Well, Roland started on his own, and then we tried to coach him into really making it  sound right.  Didn't quite work.  Okay.  What's wrong?  Nothing.  Are you okay?  Yeah.  You having a burtation?  No.  What's the matter? 
[01:38:00]  Something happened?  No.  I'm trying to hold back.  What's the matter?  Oh.  Nothing.  No, no, no.  Hold back about it.  No, no, no.  I don't need to hold back.  Let's talk about this.  Go ahead.  Let's get it out.  No, I'm showing responsibility right now.  It's not a show.  What's the subject?  I'm showing...  Oh, more writing.  Okay, write it down.  I like the writing.  You just saw me stop myself.  Wow.  Wow.  I just feel like we should get everything off our chests.  It's a lot of writing. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, shit.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  God damn it.  Wow, that is bad.  All right.  Shit.  I'm glad you didn't get that off your chest.  I'm just going to let the dead air just be floating there awkwardly.  I just stopped myself. 
[01:39:00]  So, Roland was attempting to do Troy on your show yesterday.  Yes, he was.  Okay.  Roland, you were saying his screaming scared you.  Yeah.  Wow, Roland's good at it, too.  Good.  Really try to give a scream.  Go ahead.  Oh, my God.  That was his...  A little more.  Oh.  Here's him making a real effort.  Roland is going to do...  I'll try one more.  He's going to try it.  Don't laugh, because we want this clean.  Roland, go for it. 
[01:39:30]  Ah!  Oh, my God.  It sounds like a woman.  He really does.  And then one more.  That's it.  Is that real?  Yeah, you really can't, like...  Okay, do it, like, from your real, like, from the bass.  Ah!  Ah!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!  How much to Betsy?  It's got a high voice, I guess.  I'm just trying to imitate this again, right? 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, that's correct.  Yeah.  You had practice, though, right, Troy?  Yeah.  I've been doing it for quite some time.  Okay.  Doesn't that blow you...  Like, if I did that once, I would ruin my voice for a month.  You have to learn to scream from your stomach.  Dang!  Dang!  I scream from my stomach, like, after a night, like, Saturday.  Right into the toilet bowl. 
[01:40:30]  That's from your asshole.  You want some puking over the weekend?  Nah, actually, I didn't.  I think Melissa did.  Wait.  I saw you Saturday night.  Oh, is that when she was a little, uh...  Oh, she was looped.  When did she start puking after we left?  Nah, I think it was until, like, the next day, like, uh...  Like, probably in the afternoon of the next day.  She was kind of cute and, like, whiny.  And he was like...  She was like...  She was like...  And Anthony goes, what's wrong? 
[01:41:00]  And he picks her head up.  The way they picked Alex's head up in clockwork out of the spaghetti.  He grabs her by the hair and lifts her head.  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  She just plopped her head back down.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Was there anything worse than dealing with a really bad hangover in the middle of the summer with no air conditioning?  When you woke up, like, on a Sunday?  Wow, that's a vomit fest.  If I...  Remember those?  I need to be, like, in a meat...  I need to be, like, a fucking carbone. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, God, yeah.  Just frozen.  Carboners.  A real nice, sunny, summer day.  Yeah.  And you have no AC.  That's bad.  And you're dealing with one of those fucking horrendous...  I need that.  I need some water.  And then hours later, maybe some grapes.  Really?  Oddly enough, because the whole thing is, you know, wine.  Just grapes.  Wine will give you the shitty hangover.  Yeah, wine is a badass hangover.  All right.  Is it?  Yes. 
[01:42:00]  When we get back, Turkey, we're going to do some other things.  Oh, Sex Man.  Godzilla roar, Cloverfield roar, and Troy roar.  Oh, wow.  Really?  All right.  I'd like to hear that.  Don't tell us which one, and we'll try to guess.  Obviously, Godzilla.  Oh, really?  I was going to say Troy, too.  Oh.  Damn it.  And? 
[01:42:30]  Troy.  That's a creepy fucking sound.  Yeah.  Can you hear that one again?  That's...  Yeah, that is nasty.  That's a nasty fucking roar, man.  Cloverfield could have been a great movie, man.  Troy, go on.  They had a hit on their hands.  They had to go with that shaky fucking cam.  Shaky cam.  Blew the whole movie.  And then finally, Troy.  Yeah! 
[01:43:00]  Put in that context, it's pretty good.  He does sound like a giant monster.  Can you move around real fast between the three now?  Uh-oh.  Or is that tough to do?  I don't know.  That's tough to do, yeah.  His fingers are a little too big for the buttons.  Yeah.  A little too chubby.  Yeah, fat.  Greasy.  Pizza cheese.  Do we have E-Rock's eHarmony video that he made?  Yeah.  Oh, okay, good.  I want to hear that before break.  Can you do that, E-Rock, or no?  Yeah, I can do the sounds right now. 
[01:43:30]  All right, go ahead.  Mix them up.  That's some E-V-L.  Yeah.  That's all E-V-L.  I give the best singing voice to Cloverfield.  The best Boneyard producer to Godzilla.  E-Rock was holding back on all of us. 
[01:44:00]  You know the eHarmony video that's up to, yesterday was up to five and a half million views.  Yeah.  The girl losing her mind over the cats.  Or cats.  Most of us have either seen or heard it by now because we played it on our show.  Yeah.  E-Rock made his own eHarmony video, and we found this.  Wow.  He didn't want us to know about this.  You want to play it?  Unique.  All right.  Hello.  My name is John.  This is my first attempt at an eHarmony video. 
[01:44:30]  My first attempt online dating, so I'm excited, but I'm nervous at the same time.  So I'm just going to start talking about what I like and hope I get some replies.  Let me guess what he likes.  Food and cock.  That's my guess.  Stupid Amish beard.  I like big dicks and shoofly pie.  And go.  A recent Villanova MBA grad. 
[01:45:00]  And I love cheeseburgers.  I just love them.  I love cheeseburgers.  Sam's pointing at E-Rock.  I just love every kind of cheeseburger.  That's you eat.  This is like the other video.  Yeah, that's why.  I'm sorry.  I just...  I get emotional.  I just...  I want to eat every cheeseburger.  That's you eat. 
[01:45:30]  And I know that's crazy because I can't eat every cheeseburger, but I want to.  I want to.  Rock B.  Rock.  I'm sorry.  I get the idea.  Sex man loves cheeseburgers.  Sex man.  That wasn't supposed to get out.  What?  We didn't need that.  Is the virus in here?  Sex.  What?  What are you doing?  That bit was bad enough.  You didn't even...  It works with that.  That's right up there with just keep it a secret. 
[01:46:00]  Don't tell anyone.  Right.  That wasn't supposed to get out.  That didn't really work.  You should be punished for that.  You should be punished.  You're talking out of turn.  I believe the virus should be here after commercial break as punishment for that.  I don't disagree, Sam.  I don't disagree, actually.  I mean, there's so much going on in the news.  The problem is...  Could he do one wiener joke?  That's what I'm saying.  We haven't heard the virus do any wiener.  You think the virus could do one wiener joke today, Ant?  There's been so many.  He just looked at me and he put his hands up in the air and he had this evil look in his 
[01:46:30]  eyes and he mouthed, fuck you.  Well, he's challenging you.  He's saying that he has wiener jokes.  Yep.  Yes.  There has to be.  There's been so many made.  Right.  The topic is, it's a dick joke, which are some of the easiest jokes to make.  Should we do it now, though?  I think so, yes.  I think you're right.  Iraq, I mean...  Virus.  Virus.  Virus.  Let's bring in the virus, of course.  We've got to save this bit, because the cheeseburger thing, I had more hope for it.  It didn't really fucking work.  And he piped up, so obviously he wanted to. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He wanted to.  You can tell.  You think so, right?  It seemed that way.  By the way, Heather Haidt did an eHarmony parody video.  It's very funny.  I tweeted it yesterday, if you want to try to find it.  That's the new thing to do, is your eHarmony.  Yeah.  Her take was pretty good on it, too.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What are you doing with just walking out?  Where's the music?  Oh.  We've got to get the music, and we've got to intro the virus.  Rolling here like a boulder?  Looking for one punchline is all this is about.  This could either be 10 seconds or fucking... 
[01:47:30]  I think it has gone on as long as 20 minutes to find one fucking punchline.  It's been ponderous and painful.  Jimmy, you want to intro the virus today?  Ladies and gentlemen, coming straight from Lumpsville.  USA.  Lumpsville, USA.  Please welcome the comedy stylings of the virus.  The virus.  Ladies and gentlemen, the virus.  With one punchline.  Yeah.  One punchline.  That's all we need.  Why aren't you excited? 
[01:48:00]  Virus is never excited about performing.  He's never excited.  You would think being a comic.  Yeah.  Hi, guys.  Hey, virus.  Hi, guys.  Oh, yeah.  It's been a long time.  It really has been a long time, Sam.  Yeah.  What do you got today, virus?  Virus.  And goof.  Virus, you hear, obviously, wow.  This wiener, this Anthony wiener, boy, is he in Dutch for sending some pictures to a girl on the Internet. 
[01:48:30]  He's married.  He's a congressman.  Boy, she might be stepping down.  He might get kicked out.  So much going on with the wiener story.  Why is Mars in here?  Are you a big fan of the virus?  Yes, you are.  I'm a big fan of watching anyone bomb.  Virus.  Virus.  At least start with, did you hear about?  Yeah.  At least do the setup.  Come on, virus.  Maybe something will pop into your head. 
[01:49:00]  Virus.  Looking for one punchline.  Here he is.  And go.  Go.  Did you hear?  Get there, buddy.  Fucking kill you.  Did you hear about more Anthony wiener pics are out?  We did, yes.  Yes, yes.  A lot of pictures out there.  And one punchline.  And your turn.  The pictures.  Here it comes.  We heard about the pictures.  Yeah, we heard about the more Anthony wiener pictures. 
[01:49:30]  Virus.  I don't believe the answers on those second-rate shoes, virus.  Oh, shit.  I'm waiting for one punchline.  Start over.  You've got to start up with like a, it's got to be a leader.  You can't just say, did you hear about it?  You need a.  What's the virus in his phone doing?  Start over. 
[01:50:00]  Hi, guys.  Hey, virus.  Did you hear there's more Anthony wiener pics available online?  Yeah.  I sure have.  You bet.  Yes.  One punchline.  One.  Two.  Yes.  Yes.  We heard.  And we're looking forward to hearing more.  Here we go. 
[01:50:30]  Go ski.  Let it roll.  One punchline.  Here it is.  Three, two, one, and go.  Nah.  Wow.  It's just.  It's anything.  Dick joke.  Wiener.  Dick.  I've never seen anyone focus so hard in my life with nothing to say. 
[01:51:00]  What was the setup again?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Got to go back to the setup.  Too much time in between the setup and the punchline.  Yeah.  Timing.  Oh, boy.  Timing.  Did you hear?  Yeah.  Did you hear?  Did you hear?  There's more Anthony Wiener picks available online.  Ah, tell us.  Tell us more, virus. 
[01:51:30]  Yes.  No.  Yes, I did.  By the way, a lot of punchlines coming in on the Institute back in Twitter.  Oh, of course.  None from that guy.  Yeah.  This guy writes, that guy made a real dick of himself.  Bit over.  Anything.  I like that one.  Yeah.  Jay from Huntington.  Doesn't have to be a great joke. 
[01:52:00]  And he's just Jay from Huntington.  Exactly.  He's not the virus.  He's the headliner.  The king of the one-liners.  The virus.  The king of the punchline.  The virus.  And you.  Come on, virus.  You got it.  Let's go, virus.  Everyone's listening, waiting to go to break.  Yeah.  Just waiting on you.  Waiting on you.  Waiting on you.  Waiting on you.  That's why you got into this business.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Virus. 
[01:52:30]  Wow.  Wiener.  What was the setup?  Yeah, you got to go back to the setup.  People just tuning in.  We got the virus in the middle of a punchline.  Looking for a walk.  Setup.  Forgot the joke.  Can you at least do the setup?  So we don't sound like idiots.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Did you hear there's more Anthony Wiener pictures available online?  Yeah.  Yeah, Wiener.  Wiener dick photos. 
[01:53:00]  Wiener dick cock.  Let's hear a funny thought with that.  Go.  Fuck you.  There's a heckler out there.  I'll help you out.  Three, two, one.  You're on.  I'll help you.  That's real help.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Go for it, big guy.  Honeydew Wilkins is making a request from Oklahoma City,  because I know he's just sitting there doing nothing over there.  So we've got to fill up the time.  Can the virus end his jokes with ham sandwich? 
[01:53:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Come on.  Ham burn.  Oh, he's got one, Jimmy.  Yes, he does.  He's got one.  He stood up straight.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Wiener.  Come on.  You're in the business of talk.  You're on the radio.  Just turned his back to the crowd, too.  Yeah.  His name means penis.  Yeah.  You do a pun or some sort of a dick tie-in. 
[01:54:00]  Come on.  All right.  What, is it set up?  Yeah.  Get you to set up again.  Come on, virus.  I'll help you out.  Get it.  Sit up now.  Did you hear?  There's more Anthony Wiener pictures available online.  Punchline now!  I heard.  Last time I saw a dick like that.  You know.  Yeah.  Something like that, maybe.  Exactly.  I was leaning against the wall, humiliated. 
[01:54:30]  Or something.  Wiener also means hot dog.  That's right.  Hot dog or puns.  Wiener dog.  Last time I saw a wiener like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, he's got one.  He's got one.  There you go.  He's working it out.  Finally.  He's working it together.  We can go to break.  Here it is.  Come on.  Finally.  Here you go.  He's got it.  Look at him.  Look at him.  The joke you've been waiting for.  Here it is. 
[01:55:00]  Now he's mouthing something.  He's mouthing something.  He's working it out in his head.  He's just mouthing something properly.  Mouthing something.  Yes.  It's like a sandwich.  Too bad it's not a hollow point.  He's putting it together.  Oscar Mayer.  That's right.  Yeah.  Think of that.  He's mouthing the words.  Let's go.  We heard and we're waiting for more.  Stop looking up into the vents.  By the way.  A gift of humor is not going to fall out of those vents. 
[01:55:30]  Let us know.  I mean, Virus, let us know when you're ready.  Yeah.  By the way.  By the way.  Anthony's a seer.  Yeah.  You said just last week.  Yeah.  That this place, Sirius XM, will kill somebody.  Oh, wow.  Jesus.  Don't even.  The stress.  You said the stress in this place will kill.  I don't know the exact quote.  Will kill somebody.  I did.  You're right.  When Roland was having his breakdown.  Wow.  Just want to put that out there.  It's a little creepy that you said that.  It is. 
[01:56:00]  That's Twilight Zone-ish.  And we lost a really good kid from Liquid Metal overnight.  Oh, I'm sure it was stress.  And now back to the virus.  That's right.  The virus, ladies and gentlemen.  You had what we're mouthing there.  Just do it.  Yeah.  Have some faith in that great joke.  But we're going to need the setup.  Yeah, we're going to need the setup.  We're going to need the setup.  Just go with it because it looked like you had it there.  You were mouthing those words.  Let's just hear it.  Here we go.  Here it is.  The virus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Confidence.  Eyes on the audience.  He's almost there.  How do you get Anthony Weiner to stop grabbing his cock?  You throw a penny at him. 
[01:56:30]  Get it?  It's a Jewish joke, too.  You can make it a Jewish joke or whatever.  You can go Jewy Jew.  Yeah.  You can go pee and penis.  What are we doing on our night of stand-up for the staff?  Do you know how great this would be?  A night of stand-up for the staff.  Oh, God.  Would that be fantastic?  Just let E-Roc go first and none of us, no one else has to go.  No one has to go.  There'd be red light and not a word has been said.  Virus can host.  Oh, MC Virus.  You had it.  You had it.  Do the setup.  Let's go.  Yeah, come on. 
[01:57:00]  What were you thinking?  You were definitely, you had something.  You did.  Come on now.  Just say it.  Jordan and Scrantz.  Shucky Ducky.  Snack, snack.  Shucky Ducky.  Crack, crack.  Crack, crack.  Crack, crack.  Come on, Virus.  He's got a big nose.  Don't forget that.  See, Coke logic.  The cock photos just keep coming.  Ah.  There you go.  Yeah.  Come on.  Cock coming.  Wiener.  Yeah.  He's probably tying in a smart joke about the congressional gym.  Right.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Let's go, Virus.  What were you mouthing? 
[01:57:30]  You had it.  Doesn't make any sense.  So just say it.  If it doesn't make sense, sometimes it's absurd.  Those are the best ones.  He's probably going for George Carlin when all we need is Henny Youngman here.  Exactly.  Don't worry about it.  There's some Henny Youngman.  Let's go.  Set up action.  Set up.  Did you see that there's more Anthony Wiener video?  No.  No.  Did you see that there's more Anthony Wiener picks available online?  Yes.  Yes.  Now. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  It's so close.  It's there.  It's there.  Just spit it out.  I wish you could see what we're looking at.  Come on.  He's so close.  He put his mouth on the mic.  He's actually squeezing a fist right now.  He's got it.  Get that.  You got to get the set up.  Here it is.  It's sitting in that rotten mouth here.  Chokey, chokey.  Fat, fat.  Thank you, Seth.  Illinois.  Right on the tip of your tongue next to that pork chop. 
[01:58:30]  Take our little dinner.  Come on, man.  We're 12 minutes into this.  God, Jesus.  We're 12 minutes in, I think.  Quick joke.  All right.  He's got it.  He's got it.  He just cleared his throat.  There it is.  That's usually a sign.  Did you hear that there's more Anthony Wiener picks available online?  Yes, we did.  Oh, yeah.  With those photos, he officially qualifies for the Nathan Hot Dog Contest.  Why doesn't he make sense?  That makes no sense. 
[01:59:00]  Get the fuck out of here.  That's terrible.  Oh, hot dogs.  What are you?  Yeah.  That's not even.  He qualified.  Dunk.  Why would he qualify for the Nathan's?  Oh, God.  We had high expectations today.  He comes up with that shit.  He had 12, 13 minutes to work on that.  Why would he qualify for the?  Yeah.  Why would that qualify?  He stinks.  He's so bad.  That's horrible.  He didn't even go for penis.  He went for a hot dog.  What does that mean?  He's eating his own cock?  Like, I don't get it. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, wow.  What the fuck?  Why would he eat his own dick?  Why the fuck did he even do that?  He's the wiener.  He's going to talk to shit like that.  Wouldn't he get eaten in the contest?  Yeah.  Even if the joke was bad, but that was almost offensively non-joke.  Yeah.  I'm angry now.  Yeah, man.  He qualifies.  We bring him in to bring happiness to everybody.  Oh, yeah.  The virus.  What the fuck?  The virus.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.B. and Anthony. 
[02:00:00]  Hey, what happened on Fox Business?  Little Ebonics thing?  Yeah, he's being called a horrible racist, the guy.  Is he really?  Yeah.  Anchor Eric Bolling.  Bolling?  How do you say his name?  B-O-L-L.  How do you say that?  Bolling?  I'm going to guess the ball. 
[02:00:30]  I don't know.  Before you pop this in, I've got to know before I forget.  Do we have the video?  I mean, you can pop it in, but don't play it, because I'll forget in a second.  Do we have the audio of the daughter of the woman that got the face transplant from  the monkey ripping off her face?  Oh, fuck.  I heard about it.  I don't think so.  Oh, I...  We've got to get that?  I've not heard about it or heard it?  Someone tweeted it to me yesterday.  It is fucking brutal.  This reporter is a dummy.  All right.  We've got to get that.  Not listening dummy.  Can we get that? 
[02:01:00]  Is it a long...  It was tweeted to me yesterday.  Is it a long one?  No.  It's quick.  All right.  Let's find that.  Oh, was it...  The Twitter name, give him credit, was it Ape Face?  I don't think it was Ape Face.  Yeah, I think it was Chewed Testicles.  That's one of the...  I hate this Continental United merger.  I said chimp, didn't I?  I said monkey.  I know it's not a monkey.  Whatever.  It's the same thing.  No, a chimp...  They jump up and down, they bite you.  ...is one of the great apes.  Monkeys are just monkeys. 
[02:01:30]  A chimp is one of the great apes, one of the great primates, along with an orangutan.  Orangutan and the gorilla and the chimpanzee, which is very different from, let's say, a macaque.  What gorilla-type animal you hate the worst?  Gorilla-type animal?  I just don't like those fucking orangutangs.  Orangutangs are the worst?  They're really like, ugh, they just look stupid.  I think they are the retards of the great apes.  A chimp's a baby or, like, young chimp in the old-fashioned engineer uniform. 
[02:02:00]  Where they'd wear the suspenders and the little train engineer hat.  Nothing cuter in the world.  Alright, so go from your favorite to your worst, then.  I gotta go with the chimpanzee in the engineer suit.  Gotcha.  That's good.  Okay.  Then I guess I gotta go with the gorilla.  The gorilla, especially the little baby gorilla's eyes are really cute when they look around.  They don't know what they're doing and stuff. 
[02:02:30]  And then the stupid orangutan.  Is the worst.  Yeah.  Is there something in between you're missing?  No, I think that's pretty much it for, like, the basic great apes.  What about those weird skinny monkey-type fucking animals?  Those are monkeys, though.  They're not like apes.  Like one of those long-armed fucking dumb monkeys.  What about the monkey-type thing that has the big, huge red S?  That's a baboon.  Yeah, you didn't put baboon in there.  I don't think baboon is part of the great apes.  Oh, I don't know.  Technicality.  Come on.  I don't know. 
[02:03:00]  I know, uh, uh, yeah, well, a gibbon.  You're talking about a gibbon?  A gibbon.  A fucking long-armed gibbon?  I hate a gibbon.  Yeah, I like a ticken.  Yeah.  A gibsman-dat-bun.  Right.  So what happened to this Fox Business guy?  Eric Bowling.  Bowling.  What did he say?  Accused of racism for use of Ebonics during Obama's story.  Guess who's coming to dinner?  A dictator.  Mr. Obama shares a laugh with one of Africa's kleptocrats.  It's not the first time he's had a hoodlum in his house. 
[02:03:30]  What?  What is he doing there?  Some Ebonics.  Is that what he's doing?  I don't think he's a racist.  I think he's just a corny fucking white guy trying to be funny.  Yeah, cornball.  You're not being edgy or funny.  Just trying to be one of those guys.  He's a cornball.  Smile for the birdie.  Our president sitting with one of Africa's most wanted.  It's not the first time he's had a hood in the big crib.  Come on.  What's wrong with this?  Is this a real issue? 
[02:04:00]  It shouldn't be.  Because he's just...  Is this guy in trouble for just being wacky?  This is just wackiness.  He should be in trouble for being awful.  So what's with all the hoods and the hizzy?  A month after the White House hosted the rapper Common, who glorifies violence on cops,  the president opened his doors to one of Africa's most evil dictators.  This shouldn't be a problem.  The rapper thing I get, because they did have a rapper who had talked...  Yeah, I mean...  Mm-hmm. 
[02:04:30]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I'm trying to find that one, too.  I'm sure Media Matters is all over it.  It's like...  Cocksuckers.  Shit.  You trying to see if this guy's in trouble?  We have it.  Wait.  I wonder if I got...  Where's this audio?  Wait, wait, wait.  I might have it.  I might have it.  I might have it in my...  You might have what?  The chimp thing?  Yeah, I might.  All right.  We'll find that.  Are we done with this guy from the Fox Business?  Yeah, he just sounds like he's being zany or something.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Fair enough, sir.  Yeah, we could cut our losses there. 
[02:05:00]  You heard about the St. Louis woman?  What happened in St. Lou?  Huh?  Huh?  St. Louis...  All right.  I'll just...  St. Louis woman awarded $95 million after a former boss  allegedly masturbated on her.  $95 million?  I would fucking let my boss do it for a minute.  If I was going to get a million dollars,  they fucking just spew on me.  It would not be worth that much.  I'd let Bladder fuck me in the butt for $2,500. 
[02:05:30]  The St. Louis woman who said...  What are you getting now?  Exactly.  I'd let the lawyers here fuck me in the ass  for exactly what my salary is for the last three years.  That's it.  We're already getting fucked in the ass.  A St. Louis woman...  This could be one of the funniest lines ever written.  Ready for this?  Yeah.  Are you ready?  I'm ready.  A St. Louis woman who said she was hit on the head  with her boss's genitals...  Hit on the head?  How does that happen?  Was awarded what her attorneys believe 
[02:06:00]  is the largest payout ever  in an American sexual harassment lawsuit.  What kind of job is this?  Ashley Alford was awarded $95 million  in compensation from the Aarons Inc.,  a large rent-to-own furniture chain  after she said the store failed to act  after a manager allegedly assaulted her twice in one day.  She told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution  that the award was likely to be capped  because of federal law  and will be closer to $40 million.  Damn, that's a good payday. 
[02:06:30]  Fuck you.  It's in Atlanta?  You would deal with that for $40 million?  Wait, it's Atlanta?  Yes.  Crazy money.  So here's what it is.  The jury...  I'm going to guess...  The jury.  I can guess the makeup of the jury.  Give me a jury.  Really?  Alfred claimed that the store's then-manager,  Richard Moore,  gave her inappropriate nicknames  and touched her inappropriately  when she first began working there in 2005.  Nearly a year after she was hired,  she claimed he came up to her in the stockroom 
[02:07:00]  and whacked her on the head with his penis.  How do you do that?  Was she sitting down?  She had to be.  That's fucked up.  That's funny?  That is funny.  All right, good.  Funny.  Damn it.  Sorry, but that's just funny.  That's amazing.  Then later that day,  he lifted her shirt and masturbated over her  as he held her down.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, that's a little rough.  Now I'm out.  You're out?  You can't hold the woman down.  No, no.  You've got to give her a chance to leave this situation. 
[02:07:30]  Hold on a minute.  Now you're trying to jerk off on her.  Are we going to just let her scramble away  so you look silly?  If she wants to stay there  and be jerked off on...  Do people really work at places  where a boss might take his fucking penis out  and hit you on the head?  And just start fucking hitting you on the head  with his schlong?  What the fuck?  Believe me,  that's literally no more shocking  than what goes on here.  No, same shit.  Would they really allow the line...  The online...  The online...  I just...  I just stopped. 
[02:08:00]  I just stopped.  Turn off.  Turn off.  Is this the chimp thing?  I'm looking for...  I don't think it was that...  You think that St. Louis woman's line?  Reporter thing.  God damn it.  Exaggerating, definitely.  You think exaggerating?  Yeah, definitely exaggerating.  What do you think really happened?  He probably pulled his dick out.  Wow, a boss is poor...  Waved it in her face.  Do you think he thought he could do that  because she might have been accepting?  Or did he completely just lose it  and the perv switch went off? 
[02:08:30]  Why wouldn't he just lie?  The perv switch went off.  Really?  I didn't jerk off on you, madam.  Madam.  News 4 interview with...  Chimp victim.  Nice.  Got it.  You got it?  Yeah.  Now what do we do with it?  I don't know.  I pass it on.  How do you get it to...  How do I get it over there?  I'll turn it off.  I could tweet you.  All right, hold on.  Let me try to...  Oh, my God.  Thank you, Kevin, from Connecticut.  Why does the name always match the story?  Oh, like Wiener? 
[02:09:00]  Like Wiener with his Wiener pictures?  Yeah.  The boss's name was Richard Moore.  Dick Moore.  Dick Moore.  Dick Moore.  Why does that always work out in news stories?  I don't know.  Why did that pass us by?  But it does.  His fucking first name is Dick.  My Dick.  And Dick Moore.  Oh, my God.  These computers, by the way, suck an asshole.  Nice language.  A giant asshole.  Well, why didn't you say anything about that before now?  That's weird that...  Because it just hit me again. 
[02:09:30]  Again.  Again.  Thank you for saying it again.  It hit me.  We've been talking about how bad these computers are for a long, long time.  Well, I'm going to share to Twitter.  I'm sure they're making progress on that.  Like, they're making progress on getting us interns.  I'm just going to...  Here it goes.  Good news for everybody.  I just shared to Twitter.  Did you get it?  Do you see it?  Now look for me.  Look for me, and then I got it.  I'm on.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  That should be it.  Nope.  Think. 
[02:10:00]  Nope.  There it is.  You obviously blocked me because I can't see it.  Why would you block me?  What did I do to you?  You know...  Why would you block Hope?  I don't see...  I didn't see your tweet.  That's not very nice.  First of all...  Did you block me?  I'm a LeBron James fan, and I don't need to read shit like that.  Look, I'm just going back to my shitty life today.  Back to your shitty life.  Stupid LeBron James.  Really knows how to win some of the fans back.  Yeah.  Did you get it?  Yeah, I got both.  I got that.  Both?  Wait a minute.  Did you block me? 
[02:10:30]  No.  Why am I not getting a tweet?  No, I follow.  Why'd you block Hope?  You blocked me.  Why'd you block Gregorio?  Did you go to...  Son of a bitch!  Where did you go to?  You just went to, like, Anthony?  You went to my thing?  Well, you tweeted it, right?  Yeah.  Did you retweet it?  No, no, no.  No, I just tweeted it.  Did you DM it?  No, I just...  With a dick pic?  I just shared it from Twitter, from Facebook, from YouTube.  Oh, my gosh.  What?  What happened?  I just shared it from YouTube.  I found it on YouTube. 
[02:11:00]  I put share and tweeted it.  Oh.  And a lady popped up with a crisp pen.  So if you got a my name...  Oh, here it is.  You got a my name.  Oh, you unblocked me to save face, I see.  That's true.  About time.  Now it's here.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I did really quickly.  Uh-huh.  I had to.  Oh, I'm going to watch this.  This looks good.  Okay, put...  Well, put it up.  Put the volume up.  Listen to what she says.  Do it on the computer.  No, don't do it.  You got to see it all on the air.  I'm watching it right now.  No, do it on the air.  What?  That way it's fucked up.  Why don't you just put it on the thing?  Do it on the air. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, just put it on.  It's right there.  Do it.  Just do it.  Play that one.  She's not bad looking.  Oh, she wasn't eaten by a gorilla.  Now put the volume up.  Oh, wow.  Look at her.  No, stop it.  Until the volume's up.  What?  I don't have the option to do that.  You got to put the volume up.  You put the volume up.  No, no, no.  What happened?  It's good.  She's fucked up.  You'll just see how retarded this reporter is.  All right, what's the setup on this?  All right, this is the woman.  She's the daughter of the woman that got her face ripped off.  Remember that?  Right.  By the chimpanzee.  Charlotte Nash.  It ate her fucking face.  She's still alive?  Yeah. 
[02:12:00]  She got a face transplant.  Didn't somebody die in that incident?  Like the...  Yeah, the woman that owned the monkey.  Right, okay.  The chimp, whatever the fuck you want to call it.  And the chimp died, too.  But the woman that's still alive with basically no face or a reconstructive face.  This is her daughter.  That's her daughter commenting on how the face transplant went to this reporter, who  obviously is not listening to a goddamn thing.  Gotcha.  All right.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Put the TV there.  Just play.  How do I do that?  No, do it there.  I want it over there.  How she's feeling?  Has she been able to see her new face? 
[02:12:30]  It's still a little difficult to understand her, but she says things like she loves me and  things like that.  And no, she will not be able to see her new face.  Can you imagine that moment, though, when that mirror is held up?  What do you think her reaction will be?  Well, she can't say.  Yeah.  Well, and I know that your Uncle Steve, your mom's...  She's blind.  She had her eyeballs ripped out, you dumb fucking reporter.  Like, the reporter didn't do enough research to realize the woman's blind. 
[02:13:00]  She goes, no, she won't see her face.  And why would she say what do you think her reaction would be?  Because this is what her reaction would be.  Oh, my God!  Ah!  Ah!  Can you rewind that a little bit?  This is why that reporter is fucking...  That's Amy...  That's Amy...  That's Amy...  Robot.  The reporter should be...  She used to be really hot.  But why not just admit that...  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't know that.  You know what?  I'm sorry.  I forgot that.  She just...  They're fucking robots!  Robots!  Nah.  Does she acknowledge that she just asked what a blind woman's going to say?  No. 
[02:13:30]  No.  But it's a harsh question to be asking the daughter to begin with.  Because the woman can't be pleased with her new face no matter what.  But she's, like, saying, like...  Even if she could see.  She even...  The daughter even, like, hinted, like, no, she won't be seeing her new face.  Is she seeing how she's feeling?  Has she been able to see her new face?  It's still a little difficult to understand her.  But she says things, like, she loves me and things like that.  And, um, no, she will not be able to see her new face.  Can you imagine that moment, though, when that mirror is held up? 
[02:14:00]  What do you think her reaction will be?  Well, she can't say.  Yeah.  Well, and I know that you're Uncle Steve, your mom's brother.  Wow.  Yeah.  In that moment is everything that is wrong with the fucking media in this country.  Yes.  You fucking soulless dummies.  How about you listen?  Did you say she doesn't listen?  She didn't do research on the story.  Oh, face transplant?  Let me see.  Oh, wow, she lost both her eyeballs.  So they're going to have to put in, you know, prosthetic eyes.  And she gets this face transplant, but she's blind. 
[02:14:30]  She didn't even see that part of the story.  But even if you didn't know that and you made the flaw, it happens.  How about you go, oh, God, I didn't like it.  Oh, God, I'm sorry.  You're fucking.  Oh, right back to pleasantness.  Yeah.  Pleasantness.  Get the pleasantness.  So your uncle.  Uncle Steve, he's got eyes.  Pleasantness.  That is everything that's wrong with those shitheads.  Absolutely.  How important are the eyeballs?  That's coming in on.  Well, you're asking a question about seeing. 
[02:15:00]  How important is it to not have your cornea scraped out by dirty monkey fingers?  How damaging is that to the retina when dirt-scraping monkey figures dig into your eyes angrily for 12 minutes?  Oh, you know how bad that is?  He's just been picking his monkey hemorrhoids right up his ass, and then he just puts a gaping wound in you.  Believe me, that monkey was not Purelling right before he began doing eye surgery on old Charlotte Nash.  All right, your uncle Steve, not one word about the insensitive question she just asked. 
[02:15:30]  Unbelievable.  How about an apology?  How about you go, you want Tracy Morgan to apologize?  How about that woman who is absolutely not doing her fucking job properly?  Right.  He goes, oh, God, I'm sorry, I didn't notice.  Oh, sorry.  How about a human moment?  Yeah, what would be wrong with that?  It would be no problem.  We all fuck up.  Right.  And the daughter's there going, she can't see.  Yeah, she's blind.  Oh, she's blind.  So imagine when the mirror's held up.  Yeah, mirror, you mean the thing you look into with eyeballs, you dummy? 
[02:16:00]  Exactly.  Like I said, she fucking couldn't do.  What's her name again?  Amy Roebuck?  Did I get it right?  Which channel is that?  That's NBC.  That was the Today Show, right?  God, they're all so fucking robotic.  That's why none of them really add anything.  Yeah.  None of them add anything.  Literally, the news could just scroll and we could read it ourselves.  Yeah.  And we do it online anyway.  God, what a dope.  We don't need those dummies.  We don't need those dummies anymore.  Just keep it pleasant.  Keep it pleasant. 
[02:16:30]  Don't acknowledge your mistake.  Yeah.  Wow.  Thank you, Ant.  That's fucking...  Oh, I love that one.  That's a great one.  That's a fun one right there.  Not as good as the woman getting hit in the head with her boss's dick.  Well, I wish I had some video of that, or audio at least, hit with a dick.  And she made some cash off of that one, huh?  95, possibly only 40 in the end, I guess.  I have a prediction for the fucking Casey Anthony trial right there.  Right.  She will not be convicted of first degree murder. 
[02:17:00]  Whoa.  With the jury already?  No.  I guess the prosecution has another witness, and then they're going to wrap up, and then  the defense takes over.  And, you know, there's maybe another week or two left of the trial.  But this is a capital murder case, and they just don't have it.  They don't have enough evidence.  Too much doubt?  Yeah, maybe not.  Too much.  They don't have enough evidence.  As far as that charge goes.  Look, people...  Right.  People know she's involved in some type of shenanigans with this kid being dead. 
[02:17:30]  Language!  I know.  But as far as getting a first degree murder charge on that, nah.  I ain't seeing it.  No fucking way.  So she gets the lesser charge, and then how many years in jail?  I don't know.  She's got some other charges against her, but she's not got that major one.  That was the biggie.  And if they can get a mistrial out of this, they're going to have to give her some kind  of manslaughter, maybe, or involuntary, or negligent homicide, something like that. 
[02:18:00]  Because they don't know if she did drown in the pool, and then all she did as a guilty  person was throw the kid in the woods instead of report it.  Or did she kill this girl flat out, first degree murder, because she wanted to go out  and party?  Or did she drug her to try to go out, and the kid wound up dying?  Like, there's a few different...  There's too many different ways this kid could have died, and they don't have any proof.  Well, how about this?  Since this bitch isn't saying anything, and she knows what happened, how about... 
[02:18:30]  Here's what the deal is.  If you want to save your own life, you get up there and you tell us what happened.  Otherwise, we're going to assume you killed the kid.  Enough already.  So you want to throw away the Fifth?  No, no.  Do I just throw away the Fifth Amendment on self-incrimination?  No, I understand self-incrimination, but it is enraging.  It's like, don't cry if you get convicted then.  If you sit there, and you don't fucking sit up and speak for yourself, you deserve to be  convicted.  You're a dope, and I can't think of how I would never...  I wouldn't defend myself in court. 
[02:19:00]  If you were innocent, right?  Yeah, if I was innocent, I would scream it.  But sometimes you'll look even worse, I think.  I don't know.  I think that myself, too.  It's like, if you're innocent, you'll get your ass on that stand and plead to that fucking  jury, that you're innocent.  But a lot of these lawyers are like, no, the worst thing you can do is get up on that stand.  You've got to, you know, let us do it.  It's all the facts.  Because that's based on pure emotion.  Did OJ not testify?  OJ didn't testify, no.  That's pure emotion that you're trying to evoke when you testify. 
[02:19:30]  The jury is just going to see that.  They're really going to have a hard time listening to your facts.  The lawyer can spill facts and experts and whatnot.  But when you get up there and talk, that is the jury looking at you going, oh, so here's  the murderer.  Let's see what she's got to say to get herself off the hook.  So sometimes they have them not testify.  Okay.  I don't know.  I don't think they'll ever testify.  I really do think the prosecution has had trouble proving this case. 
[02:20:00]  And I've watched the whole fucking thing.  I'm no expert, but neither is the jury.  So sitting there watching it, I just don't see that they've proven beyond reasonable doubt  that she intentionally murdered a child.  I think the pool thing that the defense has brought up is not a bad way to confuse the  jury.  All the defense has to do is throw enough options out.  They don't have to prove the kid died in a pool.  They don't have to prove that the kid accidentally overdosed. 
[02:20:30]  They don't have to prove that the mother fucking killed the kid.  All they have to do is throw enough options out there where the prosecution can't prove  any of these didn't happen or did happen.  It's a shell game.  The mother's a pig.  She's a fucking pig.  She's a fucking tits.  I'm not saying I wouldn't titty fuck her.  Oh, I was.  As punishment.  Oh, she should just be over the house.  Doesn't she go against your whole baby thing, though?  She had a kid.  She hates kids, apparently.  But it's great.  Didn't that ruin her body?  You say that. 
[02:21:00]  No, you know what?  I don't know.  She looked like she kind of snapped back in a little slop in her.  I'm not talking fucking marrying the broad.  I'm just talking about, you know, maybe a little hot tub action.  Like Bobby.  Bobby Kelly.  You shouldn't be fucking...  She knows what happened to that kid and she's not saying.  She is...  I hope that even if it would turn on appeal, I hope she gets convicted of first-degree  murder.  All of her money is going to legal fees anyway.  She's said.  She's said what happened.  She's a compulsive liar.  Yeah, she's sickening. 
[02:21:30]  She's made up this nanny that never existed.  She's lied about looking for the child.  She didn't report the child missing for 31 days.  She really should.  If we had a really good system of justice, we all know what's going on.  The bailiff should be able just to put a gun at her temple and fire it.  And just fire the trigger.  Just fire it.  But everything that she's been doing, guilty, everything she's been doing and saying could  also point to the kid accidentally died. 
[02:22:00]  She wanted to just cover it up by ditching the kid in the woods.  So why isn't she saying that?  Why does she know that she's fighting for her life and she's not saying this is what happened?  I think as far as what's going on in that trial right now, the best thing she could do is  shut the fuck up.  They don't have any time of death.  Really?  It's not exact because all they found was bones months later.  Is there nothing in the bones they could get DNA-wise?  Nothing in the marrow?  They got DNA that prove it's the child. 
[02:22:30]  But I mean there's nothing like from, I guess, a drug or anything?  To find, no, there was no broken bones.  There was no, the only thing they come up with are things like, well, the mandible was  still held on the skull and that proves that the duct tape was put there before the child  died.  And it just sounds very vague.  Like the prosecution doesn't have a, here's when the baby died and here's where she was.  What, she doesn't need an alibi because they can't really determine the time close enough 
[02:23:00]  to where she would need an alibi.  Do you think the kid was crying and she fucking tied the kid to the bed and duct tape her mouth  because she was doing something, she was having a date over.  Or in the trunk of her car.  That's what they're thinking.  They put, she put her in the trunk of her car with duct tape over her mouth after she  used like Xanax on her or something, a drugger and the kid might've vomited or just suffocated  or, or the heat from in the trunk or what have you.  And then she ditched it. 
[02:23:30]  Or she was getting laid at her house and had the kid, um, taped upstairs in the room.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It could have been that too.  Cause, cause they're saying that, that the nanny Xanny is Xanax.  She would give the kid Xanax to put her to sleep while she had her, uh, hijinks.  Oh, her duct lips.  She's fucking, this woman is killable.  Wow.  That's what, uh, Florida's hoping for the prosecution's over, but I don't see it.  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not seeing a first degree murder charge. 
[02:24:00]  I don't think the prosecution has enough on her.  Maybe there's just no way to prove it.  Yeah.  Another week or so.  It's a tough one.  Two weeks.  Another, maybe week or two for the defense closing and then deliberations.  Relatively fast trial, right?  Um, no, you know what?  Fast trials are like, yeah, OJ took forever, but, uh, this one could take a while.  And then deliberations.  I don't know.  I don't, I don't, especially if they have a, uh, split jury.  Um, I, I don't see that going that, that quickly.  You know, they've sequestered these poor motherfuckers too. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They're just like, they can't talk about anything.  Are they in a hotel or something where they get to go home?  I don't know.  Maybe they get to go home, but they can't talk to anyone.  They can't read anything.  They, they've really, uh.  That's a major inconvenience.  Oh my God.  Right.  Is that her getting a fucking finger up the ass?  That's right.  She's got her little tramp dot tattoo and she's just a whore.  Well, she has her jeans on.  How is she getting the finger up the ass?  I don't know.  Her friend is like digging in through her pants. 
[02:25:00]  Fucking around.  Yeah.  What a fucking hewa.  All right.  Well.  And then you see her, you see her laughing sometimes in court.  She'll fucking be talking to her attorney and she's like got her mouth blocked, but she's  like, ha ha.  She kind of laughs.  Why would she do that?  And then sometimes she's like, ha ha.  She's crying.  But why would she laugh?  And why, why, why doesn't her attorney.  A psychopath.  Yeah.  But why doesn't the attorney go, look, I'm trying to help you here.  Stop with the laughing shit.  I think the attorney, look at her.  She's like smiling.  Hey, my kid's dead.  She, your aunt might have just said it.  She's a psycho. 
[02:25:30]  She's a psychopath.  Of course she is.  I hate mentally ill people, as you know.  Right.  But maybe that she is literally just crazy and we're looking at her like normal people  standards.  She's truly nuts, maybe.  I think she's truly nuts.  She's a delusional, a compulsive liar, a sociopath, and a psycho.  Yeah.  And Glenn Close, it's funny.  I didn't want to argue with her, but just talking about that.  And I know that there's something to be done for mentally ill people, but I just hate  the fact that if she's, let's just say she's mentally ill.  Let's say she is.  Yeah.  You're going to tell me she's still not a pig who knows what she's doing is despair.  Of course she does.  Or she'd be admitting it, going, lunking her fucking head with hammers. 
[02:26:00]  She tries too hard.  There are prison recordings of her talking to her parents where she's saying, and she's  narcissistic too, obviously.  She's saying stuff like, you know, I've been in here.  I can't sleep.  They don't give me this.  They don't give me that.  Me, me, me.  And he goes, and all I hear is that, you know, all they want to know about is Kaylee, Kaylee,  Kaylee.  Jesus.  Like the dead daughter.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what they're asking you about.  But you're worried because you can't get the right shampoo. 
[02:26:30]  Fuck.  She's just fucking, she's, I think she's crazy.  Which is absolutely why if I lived down there or knew her, I would probably be dating her.  Because they're all fucking crazy.  I also, dude, attract a line of kooks.  Lunatics, right?  A fucking line of wackos.  Mental patients.  We've all had our share, huh?  Oh, share.  A share would mean part.  Share would mean part. 
[02:27:00]  I've always had my total.  It's a complete fucking, the glass is full, full.  Was it always?  Of lunatics.  Always crazy?  Yes.  Had my share.  Crazy people.  I would put myself in the category of had my share.  Not always.  I think I've always had crazy people.  Always crazy.  Hey, uh.  And if you're with a girl now that you deem not crazy, it's because you just haven't figured  out her craziness yet.  Mm-hmm.  See, that's where I am.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  My current girlfriend is probably completely insane. 
[02:27:30]  I just haven't quite pinned it down yet.  You haven't figured out the combination yet?  I haven't quite, yeah, hit the right combination, but it's like finding the trap in a fucking  drug dealer's car.  You gotta hit this, turn the defroster, pound the top.  One day, one day you're gonna just do something so innocent and realize, holy shit, this is  the thing.  Yeah.  You want a cookie, sweetie?  Cookies!  My father!  Well, all right!  Another lunatic.  Here comes the fucking, and then a hatch door opens in the ceiling, and fucking steamer  trunks of baggage come out. 
[02:28:00]  I'm just covered in baggage.  Yeah, why did I have to suffer every Father's Day?  Because you had a shitty father experience.  Oh, you had that one.  I had Christmas.  You had Christmas?  Yeah, yeah.  My ex-wife's father left on Christmas Day.  I was talking about one of my exes.  It was Father's Day, and then a day that was, I guess, his birthday.  Fuck you with the fucking days.  All of a sudden, it would be just a horrible day, and you would think I would write it  on the calendar for the next year, but then I would forget, and then it would be some beautiful 
[02:28:30]  day, and all of a sudden, all hell would be breaking loose, because it's father's birthday.  How about every Christmas is ruined for nine fuck years?  Right, what'd you do?  Every Christmas.  What's the matter?  This was the day that my father left our family and started a whole new family and abandoned us.  Merry fucking Christmas! 
[02:29:00]  I'm trying to find my family's here.  Fuck you.  And I know this is way in the past for you, but I'm sure you gave her probably nine nice  Christmases, or at least tried.  I tried.  That nice one might have been hard with the girlfriend around.  Oh, now she really hates Christmas.  You gave her eight good ones.  Yeah.  And one's humiliation.  But you know what I mean?  Why can't we as human beings go, okay, we had shitty Christmases in the past, but the  current person I'm with has given me wonderful Christmases.  Yeah.  So why can't you now push maybe some of those bad Christmases further away? 
[02:29:30]  No.  They will always take precedent.  Why do we do that?  Because they're crazy!  But why do we do that as human beings?  I don't know.  Why?  I don't fucking know.  Why do we do that?  I had a weird thing with Christmas for many years because my mom was the weird Christmas  one.  Really?  Yeah, because when she was growing up, obviously something bad happened around Christmas.  Oh, shit.  And every year she would kind of have a little bit of a mental breakdown about Christmas.  So then it was passed on in my generation. 
[02:30:00]  So I, for a while, felt really weird about Christmas.  I always loved Christmas.  I'm up to about seven really good ones now.  You say that.  And I was able to kind of push some of those weird Christmas memories away.  I'm not saying I'm better than anyone.  I'm not saying that.  But as human beings, why do we do that?  Always focus on the Christmases that were bad instead of adding it up and going, well,  I've had enough good Christmases now.  I don't know, because they take all the good shit for granted.  Is that what it is?  Bad shit.  Why do you think that is, Jimmy? 
[02:30:30]  She's got a juicy ass on her.  Let me turn that to me, Sam.  Yeah, right?  Look at it.  It's meaty.  Wow.  That's a fucking juicy rum.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a baby-killing ass right there.  Yeah, forgive her.  Forgive her.  All that I said, forget it.  Yeah.  She's got two guys' pants pulled down.  She's like squeezing their ass.  She is a hue-a.  Would you get really nervous when Christmas was coming around?  I would, yes.  It was like an anxiety thing.  You seem like the type of guy that would really enjoy a Christmas. 
[02:31:00]  I love Christmas.  Because I know what you do with your house and stuff.  You go all in.  I decorate it up like a winter wonderland.  So go way back, though.  Yeah.  Christmas is right around, probably right after Thanksgiving, Macy's Day's parade.  That's when it starts.  The parade ends with Santa Claus, so now it's Christmas season.  Do you start slowly but surely feeling it?  It's like, oh, boy, that turkey was good.  And once again, finishing the parade this year, Santa Claus.  Here comes Santa Claus.  Bringing in the Christmas season.  He left me. 
[02:31:30]  Shut up.  You're an adult now.  Daddy, daddy, daddy.  Any fucking grown woman with daddy issues, just stop it already.  Daddy, get the fuck over it.  They're not infallible people.  Christ almighty, unless he was tooling you in the ass, get over it.  That I'll give you.  If daddy's tooling you in the ass, you could fucking be 89 on your deathbed and go,  my father fucked me over, literally.  And that's fine. 
[02:32:00]  But if daddy maybe was working too much, daddy didn't get you, he didn't make it to your fucking play,  or daddy fucking was on a business trip during your fucking prom, shut up, you dummies.  Or even start a new family.  Yeah, whatever.  He was bored.  At what age do you let that go?  Yeah, let it go.  I'm sure if you're like an early teenager and all that, I get it.  It's got to be painful.  At a certain age, you've got to just let that shit go. 
[02:32:30]  You have to.  Let fly.  25?  Is that a fair age?  I think when you hit college, you're too busy doing all sorts of other cool shit that you can let some of that stuff go.  I'll take it one step further.  Even if he was diddling your pussy!  A pussy diddle?  Maybe he was stressed out, and mother was tired, and then he just thought, hey, I'm going to go upstairs and diddle her pussy!  Do you think the ex is enjoying Christmases to this day? 
[02:33:00]  I don't know, but I can only hope, personally, no.  Father's Day is what, this weekend?  Yeah.  Oh boy.  Yeah.  Good luck.  I feel sorry for somebody.  Oh.  Oh.  I feel sorry for somebody.  Someone's in a world of shit.  If.  If.  Who knows?  If she even has somebody.  Who knows?  I don't even fucking know what she's up to, but.  I don't either.  If she does have someone new, boy, I want to call that guy and kind of give him the heads. 
[02:33:30]  Have fun.  Kind of give him the heads up.  What to expect on Father's Day.  Anyone would have known already.  Hey, I want to squeeze in this warrior shit that's just been sitting in front of me.  How about I squeeze my dick?  My.  Oh, wiener joke.  Hey, warrior.  We got Esther Koo coming in in a few minutes, but I want to squeeze in the warrior.  Warrior.  He puts out a YouTube video exposing Hulk Hogan.  I am.  Yeah, he decided, I guess Hulk Hogan, after Macho Man died, said, it's a terrible thing 
[02:34:00]  that happened.  We had just reconnected.  Oh.  And this just.  So the warrior and Macho?  No, Hogan said this.  Hogan.  Oh, Hogan said this.  I'm sorry.  And this just rubbed the ultimate warrior.  And well, it should.  The wrong way.  The warrior is obsessed with Hulk Hogan, right?  Obsessed.  And so now apparently he's got a 55 minute YouTube video that he plans on putting out about  Hulk Hogan.  Okay.  He released a preview.  What's wrong with it?  Of his Hulk Hogan video.  And this is what we got? 
[02:34:30]  This is where the clips are from.  We love the warrior because he's just, is he doing the warrior?  No, he dropped that character.  Oh, that was kind of a character?  Yeah.  Kind of.  Okay.  I don't know what these guys.  I don't either.  I don't know what's real and fake anymore.  I believe everything is fake.  I believe everything is real.  It's the only thing I believe.  So he's talking as a normal guy?  Yes.  Wow.  And making wild accusations against Hulk Hogan.  All right.  Let's listen to this.  The warrior.  Others know it too.  They know that I don't bullshit.  They know that I never have. 
[02:35:00]  On the other hand, you have a long running reputation for being a liar and a fraud.  A warrior?  And a phony.  That sounds like I'm going to lie down.  This recent lying that you've done.  Thank you to spit it.  Let's get real, man.  You didn't reconnect with Randy.  Why does he have the action movie?  I don't know.  Dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan.  Music.  I think he just found it on, like, a video editing, you know, suite that it was, like, 
[02:35:30]  for a free bed.  And he was like, wow, this will really get people excited.  It's in, like, Apple loops.  Yeah.  He just found that.  I've been guilty of that.  Oh, yeah.  And then you're like, what am I doing?  When you first get it.  Oh, yeah.  Um, yeah, Randy was real paranoid.  I mean, when he'd walk through the dress room, he'd make Elizabeth look down.  Oh, don't look at anybody.  Don't look at her.  I'll kill you.  You know, he always was in character.  And he just saw how he was so paranoid of his wife.  And I remember when he first moved down the beach from us, they bought a little house on Kensington. 
[02:36:00]  And, you know, it's a beautiful house with a big front door.  And all of a sudden, he built a cage around the front door with another locked door.  I'm leaving for six days.  You've got six TV dinners.  Don't leave the house.  Ooh, yeah.  And you're a real piece of shit.  You just recently reconnected with a friend you hadn't spoken to in ten years.  Ten years there was silence between you and me. 
[02:36:30]  And you go on that sit-down interview show and you throw Randy under the bus in the hateful, vile way that you did?  What's wrong with you, man?  What kind of human being are you?  This is really creepy because I don't want to think that The Warrior sounds like this.  I know.  It kind of has a weak voice.  What happened to The Warrior?  To The Warrior.  It's not even associated with any.  Like, this is real life. 
[02:37:00]  Like, this is what he's actually spending his time doing.  Yeah.  But Hulk Hogan kind of, yeah, threw Randy under the bus.  Yeah.  I mean, they weren't...  It didn't sound a bit paranoid.  I mean, the Macho Man put out a rap album with battle raps against Hulk Hogan at one point.  Battle rap.  How embarrassing are those?  Bad.  Really bad.  There's a song called Be a Man that's about Hulk Hogan.  And it's Macho Man rapping.  That's the part of the Macho Man's legacy that we don't think about now that he's passed away.  Oh, really?  You kind of put that aside?  Yeah, we forget about that part.  Oh, fuck. 
[02:37:30]  We learn about Hulk Hogan's drug use thanks to The Warrior.  Yeah, The Warrior lets us know about the Hulkster's drug use.  I was there, Terry.  I know.  You and Linda contributed to the fallout of their marriage.  Randy was on the road, touring around with me night after night.  You were shooting some movie in Florida or something like that, and you and Linda got  an Elizabeth here that she needed to get out more and go do things on her own.  Kept pressuring her, and it finally happened.  And that was the beginning of the end.  You know, Terry, you get such a sick pleasure out of... 
[02:38:00]  Who's Terry?  You know, exposing other people's dirty laundry, taking cheap shots at them.  So I want to do something.  There are days, Terry, where you do do nothing but sit around and store cocaine.  Terry, you truly are a dope head.  Wow.  We have been into getting high and doing dope for years.  It was so fearful of confrontation that you assisted other guys in keeping them junkies just 
[02:38:30]  so you could have control over them.  Holy shit, Warrior.  Is there going to be a lawsuit filed on Hulk Hogan's behalf, I believe?  I would think so, especially since Hogan could use the money.  He might as well.  He pretty much, without saying allegedly or in my opinion or anything, said Hulk Hogan  is doing cocaine.  He said that he knows for a fact that there are days when Hulk Hogan does nothing but do 
[02:39:00]  cocaine.  Wow, that's a heavy allegation to make.  It's the ultimate warrior.  And it's the warrior.  And then Warrior finishes by discussing the Hulkster's open marriage.  This is going to be a much longer video on all this.  This is just the previews?  Yeah, and apparently, unbeknownst to us, Linda and the Hulkster had an open marriage.  Dirty laundry.  Like that you and Linda had an open marriage.  Oh. 
[02:39:30]  You were both whores that did slutty stuff on the side.  Couple.  Neither one of you had a problem with the other one getting thrills on the side.  In fact, Terry, you tried to get me to sample those thrills.  You know, being the only wrestler that said no to so many things in wrestling, I bet I'm  the only guy that ever said no to doing your wife.  Oh, God.  Wow.  He just goes on and on. 
[02:40:00]  So he's saying that Hulkster offered up his wife to the warrior for sex.  And the warrior said no.  Hell no.  I will not have your wife.  Right.  Unlike everyone else that you've asked.  And I am the only wrestler who has said no.  The only one.  Yeah.  You think the blue meanie got a taste?  He must have.  I mean, the meanie probably got in there.  Andre the Giant?  You think Andre?  Andre the Giant got to sample the goods.  Dick.  Got in there.  Yeah.  Oh.  The earthquake?  No problem.  No problem.  Oh, no.  According to the warrior. 
[02:40:30]  Wait, wait.  No way.  All of them.  What about, what's his name?  He used to eat the turnbuckles.  George the Animal Steal.  George the Animal Steal.  That's how he eats pussy.  Yeah, exactly.  He's just ripping pussy hair out and spitting it out like he did the turnbuckle.  According to the warrior, that's how it went down.  Oh, wow.  I can't believe it.  The warrior also in there said that Hulk Hogan caused the real life divorce of macho man Randy Savage and Miss Elizabeth.  How about the guy, the fat slobby guy that would rub his ass in wrestler's face? 
[02:41:00]  Rikishi.  Oh, do you think Rikishi would fucking rub his ass in his face?  Warrior said every wrestler.  Every wrestler.  He should say that.  He is a wrestler.  Not the Brooklyn brawler.  He's just a jobber.  It had to be the Brooklyn brawler as well.  He would let a jobber eat.  Oh, watching the Brooklyn brawler just banging away on your wife like that?  That's crazy.  I guess so.  Oh, no, no.  I don't know if I believe all of this.  What about the Iron Sheik?  The Iron Sheik?  The Iron Sheik humble?  He must have let the Iron Sheik humble Linda.  He put her in the camel clutch and fucked her until she was humble. 
[02:41:30]  I must have.  What about Vince McMahon?  Well, Vince McMahon has wrestled.  You suck my...  I can't do this.  You suck my cock.  Come on, Mrs. Hogan.  Get on your knees and suck my cock.  That's right.  Look, Hogan.  She's sucking my cock.  Yeah, you get it.  All around the head.  Now touch my balls.  Drip your saliva down my balls. 
[02:42:00]  Look, Hogan.  Look what she's doing.  She's giving me the rusty trombone.  You know, he tries to do a TVPG product.  I know, yes.  It's not like the old days.  The Warriors say it everyone.  The Warriors say it everyone.  And Vince has done some wrestling.  Plenty of it.  He's a wrestler.  You would have to assume that maybe.  I mean, according to the Warrior, Brian Kenyon from Halifax gives new meaning to the 1-2-3 kid.  I guess so.  Oh, Pat from Monoges says Ric Flair came up and went, woo, after eating her pussy. 
[02:42:30]  What was that?  Yeah.  I can't tell what he even wrote.  It went by too fast.  Oh, when Ric Flair came in her face, he'd go, woo.  That's embarrassing.  The word of the day is slander.  Yeah.  Today's word is slander.  Well, that's what.  What about the Bushwhackers?  Oh, wow.  It's a whole new meaning to their name, huh?  They got their name.  Yeah.  I'm just glad that this Hulk Hogan Ultimate Warrior beef didn't end at WrestleMania 6 when 
[02:43:00]  everybody thought it did.  And it was real.  And it's just going and climbing into social media.  I'm amazed.  Where did he post this?  He posted it on YouTube.  On YouTube?  Was there a video with it?  Oh, yeah.  You want to see what he looks like?  And he has no makeup on?  No.  It's just him being real.  Oh, I got to see what he looks like.  I haven't seen him without his warrior makeup on.  You want to go behind the curtain?  Please take me behind the curtain.  There's Ultimate Warrior on Arsenio Hall.  Oh, God. 
[02:43:30]  That's going to be great.  And doing his warrior voice, I'm sure.  Is he just kind of sitting?  Is he doing a wrestling, like, work in the mic thing?  No, he's just sitting.  He's just sitting, talking in that normal voice.  What an odd thing to do.  And why is he so mad as to expose Hulk for these allegations that he's putting out there?  Well, he made a video about the Macho Man and how he was upset by it.  And then when he saw Hulk Hogan was also upset by it, he didn't like that. 
[02:44:00]  He couldn't just leave it alone and be like, eh.  No, there's too much beef.  Too much beef?  And where does that beef come from?  WrestleMania 6.  Really?  If you could fill me in.  If you could fill me in.  What year was WrestleMania 6?  That would be 1990 was WrestleMania 6.  And what happened 21 years ago?  21 years ago, what happened?  That the warrior can't let it go.  That the warrior is accusing Hulk of having some days where he just sits and snorts cocaine. 
[02:44:30]  The warrior defeated Hulk Hogan for the world title.  Hulk Hogan passed the proverbial torch.  But, you know, only a year after that, Hulk Hogan was back in the throne as number one guy.  So, why wasn't he mad at Vince for having, you know, written it that way instead of the Hulkster for regaining the belt?  I'm sorry, you've lost me on that one.  What do you mean?  Oh, okay.  I understand now, Sam. 
[02:45:00]  Here you go.  This is what the warrior looks like.  That's him?  Oh, my God.  Get the fuck out of here.  With all the ultimate warrior paintings.  He does it.  He could pass me in the street and I would not know that was a warrior.  But look at, I mean.  No hair.  Little in the mouth.  It would be like if Jack Nicholson's house just had shining stuff everywhere.  Like, there's ultimate warrior toys and paintings.  Oh, man.  Like, he definitely has not let go of this thing.  Well, I guess the fact that he legally changed his name to warrior would have tipped us off to that. 
[02:45:30]  Well, that is.  I like the half and half horrid painting.  Half of the painting looks like him without the makeup on now.  And then the other half is the traditional ultimate warrior.  You don't think it's a well-done work of art?  That looks like something a child would do.  What do you think Superfly got in there?  Oh, Superfly Jimmy Snuka?  Okay.  I mean.  Did he get up on the top rope?  Maybe.  And then jumped off and plunged his dick right into it.  And plunged his dick in there. 
[02:46:00]  Okay.  Oh, there she is.  Okay.  Look at those tits.  All right.  Fucking bitchy.  Anthony.  Murdering bitch.  Look at that.  Casey Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  He is a weird fucking dude.  That's him working out in his gym.  Yeah.  Pumping iron.  Does he do roids, you think?  The shithole he lives in.  We don't know what he does.  Yeah, the last thing we would want him to do is we don't want him to join this stupid lawsuit between these two.  He's still got those big fake cap teeth, it looks like, though, in the front. 
[02:46:30]  They do look fake.  He's hoping to come through the front door.  Get a hug.  One of those woman-ly handshakes.  You should hear this from the beginning.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Terry.  Terry.  Rumor has it that the Warriors trying to get into your social networking party over there are being shut out.  What's up with that, brother?  I tend to think you used to be such the party animal.  I mean, what's wrong?  You don't have the guts for the game anymore now that the playing field is level? 
[02:47:00]  Well, that's a shame.  He's hoping to come through the front door.  Get a hug.  One of those woman-ly handshakes.  That's okay, man.  Me and the Warriors, we're going to make our way through the wall.  What is he doing?  He's cutting promos on YouTube about Hulk Hogan's Twitter.  In his basement.  In his basement gym.  While he's playing 80s hair metal on his iPod so he can work out. 
[02:47:30]  Now, Warriors says all wrestlers got a little taste, right?  Yeah.  Patrick Minocchi writes, big boss man.  Did he shove that nightstick up her?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, he didn't say who did what, but one would assume.  The big boss man.  Son of a slaughter.  Where are we at with the Shockmaster?  Yeah.  The Shockmaster probably fell right into him.  Oh, fell in there.  Tripped over his dick.  Yeah, that's right.  Wow.  Well, that's amazing.  We're going to have to keep tabs on this story. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  Sam, you're officially at our wrestling desk.  Okay.  You're the guy that takes care of all that.  So, any updates on this, please keep us informed.  Hulk Hogan and the Warrior.  Can we get him on the show?  From 21 years ago.  The Ultimate Warrior?  Yeah.  Get him on the show.  I'll work on it.  We'll do a photo with the Warrior.  That's got to be hard.  That's got to be tough.  Someone knows him on Twitter.  Tell him Opie and Anthony want to talk to him.  The Hulk Hogan thing.  I'm going to reach out to him.  First of all, I'm going to tell him that Opie and Anthony are both little Warriors.  We absolutely are.  Because which side are we on here? 
[02:48:30]  I would say the Warrior side.  Yes.  Well, I'm on the side of truth.  And guess who's the...  And justice.  Oh, is he on the side of truth?  The American Way.  I think it would be a great idea to get Warrior on the show so we could be his vehicle for  slander and libel.  Okay, good point.  What a great idea.  Good point, good point.  Second guessing the Warrior booking.  Yeah, I think I'm second guessing.  Maybe that's a good 10 o'clock hour and you guys could call in.  There you go.  10 o'clock hour.  I'll call in.  Yeah.  Hey, brother.  I'm getting ready for another round of rodeo. 
[02:49:00]  Nice starring Sam Roberts.  Still wearing that paint homo.  Oh, God.  Womanly handshake.  I remember his paint used to hang off his face.  That used to drive me nuts.  Yeah, it did.  It would start like peeling.  Why couldn't they get better paint for the Warrior?  Well, I mean...  It would hang.  You know what I'm talking about?  It would start to peel off or something.  Hey, quick break and then we got to get Esther Koo in here.  Yeah.  What do we know about Esther Koo?  Jimmy?  She was on Last Comic Standing and we liked her when she was on and she's... 
[02:49:30]  We absolutely liked her.  Yes.  She's very funny.  And she's making...  Did we ever do a phone call with her or anything?  I don't think so.  No.  All right.  So we're going to meet Esther Koo for the first time next.  Oh!  Stick around for that.  Stay there.  Okay, O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  This is a Superfly Jimmy Snooker and you are...  Okay, let me start.  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony?  This is Superfly Jimmy Snooker and you're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  This is Superfly Jimmy Snooker and you're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  Superfly Jimmy Snooker on your radio dial. 
[02:50:00]  The Virus.  Virus.  Call the O.P. and Anthony show now.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  Send your feedback to feedback at O.P. and Anthony.com.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Where's Esther Koo?  Let's get her in here.  Down at the office.  Yeah, down at the office.  What?  Very, um...  Very kind of flighty, I think. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, she's nuts.  Yeah, kind of like flighty, I like to say.  She was good on Last Comic Standing.  See, I tried to call Casey Anthony flighty and someone said I was really understating her lunacy.  I know we're moving on from the Hulk Hogan thing, but Warrior's saying basically everyone got a taste of his wife.  We don't know that.  Yes, that's what the Warriors say.  I'm sure there's a huge lawsuit in Warrior's future.  I see that.  But, you know, almost famous SYP writes, Linda Hogan took mustache rides on Ravishing Rick Rude's mustache. 
[02:51:00]  Remember Ravishing Rick Rude?  I haven't seen him in a while.  Where is he?  He's got to be alive.  I haven't seen him around.  He's buried in the ground.  He's dead.  Oh, no.  Ravishing Rick Rude?  Ravishing Rick Rude?  Really?  Yeah, he didn't make it.  I mean, he was still...  How old was he, though?  70 or so?  No, I mean, he wasn't quite that old.  He had to be real old because he looked healthy.  He sure did.  Well, he was born in 1958.  Oh, okay.  So if he was alive today, he'd be 53? 
[02:51:30]  When did he die?  What year?  1999.  He's been dead 12 years?  Go on.  Yeah, I mean, 41.  41's a full life.  Well, I mean, not quite 41.  Wow.  Wow.  Esther Kuh is pretty sexy, huh?  Esther Kuh.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi, Esther.  Hi.  Hi.  Damn.  How you doing?  You're all right, man.  You're all right, man.  Hello, hello.  Good morning.  Good morning to you. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, what do you got?  What are you reading about hottest porn stars?  Confessions of the hottest porn stars.  What are they confessing?  Yeah.  What are they leaving out?  Yeah.  Their home sex life.  Oh.  Is that as exciting as, like, their film sex life?  No.  Yeah, so what?  Right?  I mean, it's like, what happens when the camera's not on?  I still fuck people.  Yeah, I fuck people, but now I get up and go to the fridge and grab some water.  And I wipe myself, you know?  Oh, yeah.  They don't have somebody out there to clean them up.  I'm team Esther.  Yeah. 
[02:52:30]  I'm team Esther.  Esther's crazy, but she's very funny.  Are you crazy, Esther?  No.  Some people say.  Crazy people never think they're crazy.  Can I wear this?  Oh, yeah.  Can I wear this on?  Oh, yeah.  Watch your song, Esther.  It's easier to hear things.  Watch your song, Esther.  Oh, okay.  Oh, weird.  Why do people think you're crazy?  I don't know.  If Jim Norton's calling you crazy, you must be fucking crazy.  That's fucking crazy.  But I like Esther.  I think she's very funny.  I take that as a compliment.  Oh, I think that was a compliment.  I would take that as a compliment.  Yeah.  What are you?  What am I?  Chap?  No. 
[02:53:00]  Denise?  I'd say you're Chinese and Korean.  I'm sorry.  God, I got a sneeze for you there.  I didn't mean to do that.  Jeez, Opie.  It's okay.  I would say Japanese.  We don't like the Japs either.  Yeah.  You're not?  You know, they used to rape and pillage our people.  Korean.  Ah, Japanese.  Yeah.  No Chinese.  You're Korean.  I'm Korean.  Yeah, that's why I like you. 
[02:53:30]  Koreans, they used to take Korean women and use them for sex slaves.  The Koreans.  The Japanese.  Yeah.  Right?  I know.  The crazy Japanese.  I'll tell you why I like Koreans.  They figure out the eyes.  They figured out the eyes.  What have we figured out?  You don't want...  I am cringing right now as Opie goes into some type of racial thing.  No, man.  Yeah.  No, man.  This is getting creepy.  Yeah.  The Japanese sort of figure out the eyes, too, a little bit.  Not as much as the Koreans. 
[02:54:00]  Chinese, not so much.  They've got to figure out the eyes, too.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  She knows.  Were you born here or were you adopted as a child by some guilty white family?  I was adopted by Jews on the Upper West Side.  Is that true?  Yeah.  That was fucking awesome.  A little stroller.  Yeah.  That was awesome.  Were you one of those...  No!  I wish!  Those kids get everything!  I thought you were one of those Korean kids that came to the United States because of  all that crap that was going on.  We had a few of those...  Holy crap, though!  We had a few of those in school. 
[02:54:30]  They came over from Korea with crew cuts.  Isn't this fascinating to watch, Jimmy?  It's mind-boggling.  I remember they would walk around with their Korean to English fucking books.  I'm the only one that had these kids in school?  You don't remember the Korean kids with the crew cuts?  I went to school with Mexicans.  Yeah?  I don't know.  I'm going to shut up now.  Yeah, see, I...  I went to school...  I went to so many different schools, it didn't matter, so...  Team Coup.  Team Coup. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, Team Coup.  So you don't have Jewish parents?  No.  How did Lainey get you to do this?  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  She said that she would give me a copy of her book.  That's it?  And...  What else?  And get you on the show.  And get me on your show.  I would have got a lot of show.  I would have got a lot of show.  I'd be safe for...  Yeah.  And they're going to put my ad in the back of their magazine.  Penthouse.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Really?  No.  No?  You never know.  You were good on Last Comic Standing.  Thank you.  What's your ad for? 
[02:55:30]  No, I was just kidding.  Oh.  You were so dumb and gullible.  We liked you on Last Comic Standing.  Oh, yay.  That's where we first heard you or saw you or whatever.  And then Jimmy's like, yeah, we got to book her.  Well, I did it on my Roderick show.  We interviewed him.  Yeah.  He did me.  Yes.  What did you learn?  Interesting family life.  What was your family background?  I remember there was something very interesting about it.  There was some kind of weird religious thing.  Yeah, my parents were missionaries.  Whoa.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's weird. 
[02:56:00]  Now, so they go around and try to convert people to Catholicism?  To Christian.  Christianity.  Right.  Do they have to live in weird places?  I was thinking crusades, really.  No.  They live in Chicago.  But the Book of Mormon, you have to move to Africa, we learned.  I know, but they were like lazy missionaries.  Oh, okay.  You know?  They're like, we're going to Chicago.  They never heard of Jesus there.  Just local.  Yeah.  But they've heard of Jesus in Chicago.  I know.  That is lazy.  Yeah.  You got to get like savages that don't know what the hell is going on.  Yeah.  That don't know what a Coke bottle is.  Wow.  I know. 
[02:56:30]  So what does that entail?  Like, what do they have to do?  Just knock on doors?  Kind of like a Jehovah's Witness thing?  You know those people who give out pamphlets?  Yeah.  Those are my parents.  That was, wow.  And then I had to start doing it.  No way they forced you to do it?  Yeah, man.  I had to be like, do you want to study the Bible?  I was terrible at it, though.  So, wait a minute.  What did they think when you were like, I want to be a stand-up comic and say bad words?  Well, it kind of came slowly.  You know, I started wearing jeans to church.  Oh, that must have been like bad, right?  And I was a pianist at the church, you know? 
[02:57:00]  So, they thought I was like, fucked up.  You know, because I'm supposed to be like the model kid, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  So.  Boy, that never works out.  No.  When you think the kid's going to be like, this is going to be great.  We'll raise her.  She'll go to church.  She'll be a missionary like us.  And then, uh.  And then now I'm telling dick jokes on stage.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you dirty on stage?  I haven't seen you other than last comment.  I am dirty.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Good.  I like that when she came right in and started dropping the F-bombs and shit.  That was cool.  Your parents go to your shows? 
[02:57:30]  My mom has been.  Not your dad?  No.  Yeah, the.  No, because I do jokes about my sex life.  I can't have my dad.  Oh, shit.  That would be so weird.  Wow, would that suck?  He'd probably freak out.  Right?  What would you not want him to know?  I do jokes about Asian guys having small penises.  Yeah, and he's like an Asian guy.  He knows.  He's like an Asian guy.  He doesn't want to hear that.  He knows.  He doesn't want you to know.  So, yeah, what don't you want your parents to know about your sex life?  No, my mom can know, but it's just weird for your, you know, when you're a girl and  you have a dad, it's weird. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, most girls I know don't have dads.  But Korean dads.  Thank God.  Korean dads are strict.  Yeah.  They are.  They are.  The eye thing was a goof and a joke, but the Korean dad thing is a real thing.  Well, look at you all gussied up like that.  Yeah, wow.  Yeah, it's all right.  How did they feel about what you were saying last time?  One of them anime things.  They, um, yeah, no, they were cool with it.  I guess.  Actually, but they weren't, I remember you were edgy.  It was like, it was cool to hear that, you know, because you don't hear ethnic stuff on  TV at all.  No one does ethnic shit. 
[02:58:30]  It's only allowable if you're making fun of your own group.  Yeah.  Like you're Korean so you can make fun of Asians.  Right.  Or if you're black, you can make fun of blacks or Irish and Irish.  Yeah, they would have let me do my black jokes or G jokes.  You kidding?  Oh, damn it.  Yeah, you have to like email them, email the lawyers all your jokes.  Which one wouldn't they let you do?  Why wouldn't you do it here?  Just dropping the N-bomb all over the place.  You're getting me off the hook with the eye thing.  Come on.  You ain't getting off the hook with that eye thing.  I don't get the eye thing.  I know.  That you've got, he said like they got it down.  Meaning, you know, Koreans probably got a good mix of some kind of Southeast Asian thing 
[02:59:00]  going on and the eyes look really nice.  Oh, I get it.  Yeah.  I was just bailing him out.  I don't know what the fuck he meant.  It's just, it's a personal taste.  That's all.  Yeah.  I'm feeling you, yo.  Thai women have really nice eyes.  Yeah.  What's the black joke?  It's not a black joke.  I don't know.  Probably something about penises.  I forget.  You do?  Do they really tell you you couldn't do it? 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, they tell you what you can't do.  Didn't you get that too?  When you went?  I don't know if I submitted my jokes.  I almost never do.  I did for HBO for standards and practices, but there was nothing they asked me to take  out.  Like, I hate doing that.  Writing out your stuff.  Yeah.  But I know that with language, they're not going to, HBO is not going to say you can't  do a Jewish joke or a black joke.  They want to make sure, oh, you know what it is?  They want to make sure you're not libeling or slandering anybody.  Like, you can't say, hey, someone says a pedophile.  They're not going to let you say that because they're going to get sued.  Unless it's your dad. 
[03:00:00]  By the way, the Koreans, they were known as boat people and the churches brought them  in.  I can't.  You're the same age.  You know this.  What do I know?  Well, all of a sudden you had Korean kids running around your school that didn't speak  English.  No.  They were brought over here and they had crew cuts.  No.  Not a one.  Not a one?  No.  Not a one.  I don't remember.  A bunch of people on instant feedback.  Maybe.  I just don't remember.  I was frustrated with the, I became friends with two of them and they did way better than  I did in high school.  And they didn't even know English.  That's because we get the shit kicked out of us. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  You got to need that school where it has to be, yeah, you got to come back to like A's.  But the church groups brought them in.  Well, my, my, where I was brought up, there was a lot of church things going on.  So, a lot of churchy things.  Touching and.  No, no touching.  I thought that's what you meant.  Yeah.  I think we.  When you say church things, I'm thinking molestation.  I really think we lucked out.  I don't think we had one of those.  Yeah.  In our parish.  You just weren't cute enough.  Aww.  That hurt.  What? 
[03:01:00]  What?  That hurt.  Yeah.  I wasn't either.  You're cute.  No, but when I was growing up, I had like buck teeth and glasses and nobody molested me.  Oh, you're a propaganda poster?  Jesus Christ.  Like, wow, it just got me off the hook.  No, it's.  That's even worse than what I'm saying.  When you say that, it's like, you know.  You have to walk around with a pointy hat.  That's crazy.  We like yesterday.  That's why we're doing this.  We had creepy guys living in our basement.  Whoa.  Why?  You know, because my parents were like generous. 
[03:01:30]  They were like, Jesus loves everybody.  We take everybody in.  Oh, man.  So, we take all these ex-drug addicts and alcoholics into our house.  We had black people.  With a child in the house?  With five kids in the house.  That's crazy.  Do you know how many fucking kids of parents and missionaries are like, must get molested  because of the people they bring around?  Yeah.  How many creepy strangers?  We allowed black girls from the city to live with us in the summertime.  Yeah?  You know that.  Out on the beach?  The Fresh Air Fund or whatever.  Oh, the Fresh Air Fund.  So, all of a sudden, you have a black. 
[03:02:00]  That's crazy.  I had a black sister for a while.  Eh.  And then we brought them to the big pool.  First thing he said to her was, you got the lips and nose thing figured out.  Now, like I said, a very Catholic town.  So, all the Catholic families got to have a black girl for the summer.  Oh, wow.  That's great.  And then we went to Camp Alvernia.  You know Camp Alvernia.  And set them free at the end of the summer?  We would have a huge pool party because they had a massive Olympic-sized pool that didn't 
[03:02:30]  have a deep end.  Oh, that's what you need.  And then we all...  Something about that swimming.  Then we'd all show off our black people that we had for the summer.  And who was like...  Because I'm being completely honest here.  Was it like a status thing?  Like who had...  I guess.  You know, the black kid that was better behaved or better dressed.  I think it was to make everyone feel good about themselves.  Like, look what we're doing.  Look what we're all doing as Christians.  White people are taking in the black...  People are just dumb.  They're fucked up.  Yeah, and then we brought them... 
[03:03:00]  And then a few families, we went to Robert Moses for the day and, yeah, just enjoyed ourselves.  And then, like, shipped them back to the city.  Never heard from them yet.  Did you have to slip an extra 20 to the lifeguard to keep an eye?  Here, you know how...  You didn't do any of this shit?  You know how that swimming thing is with these...  You didn't bring any black...  No!  Were you killing my house?  I told you how I grew up.  Wow, it was horrible.  My father...  Oh, that's all I heard was that word.  But so...  It was fantastic.  So I'm just relating to you.  Wow. 
[03:03:30]  We brought in people in our house because my dad was, like, doing the, you know...  Everything...  Cared about everybody.  It was either...  Everything was either rigged that way, or I was that type of rich, or I was dressed like  one, or I couldn't...  You see what kind of sneakers I'm wearing today?  I have, you know, Converse All-Stars, black high-tops.  Right.  You know why I wear those?  Because I couldn't wear them growing up.  Because my mother said, you ain't wearing those and looking like a nigger when you go  to school.  And I'm like... 
[03:04:00]  And that's how I was spoken to as a child.  But she gave you a mink coat?  Yeah, yeah.  It made me wear a mink coat because Joe Namath wore one.  You know, the white quarterback.  She had less problems with the gays, obviously.  Yeah.  Well, I didn't.  I got the shit beat out of me for wearing a fur fucking coat.  You would have been better off with the sneakers.  Yeah.  I'd have been better off with the sneakers than being punched in the face and called  a faggot.  What kind of boys do you like?  I loved school.  Yeah.  What kind of boys do I like?  I like the ones that look like 12-year-old boys.  Really?  You like, like... 
[03:04:30]  Like the petite ones.  Twinks?  You know?  Like Sam.  Yeah.  What size pants do you wear?  Like, I need, like, a 28.  Yeah, no, it's 31.  28.  You're tubing.  Sorry.  You're the little skinny guy.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's, like, that's pretty much like Asian guys, then.  Well, except that part.  Date outside the race?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do Asians have small peeners?  They do.  They do.  They do. 
[03:05:00]  But if we say that, we get in trouble.  Okay, so let me say it.  Yeah.  But is it true?  Is it really true?  It is true.  They have small peeners?  And a lot of pubic hair.  It is true.  I had sex with a Korean guy once, and he...  My belly button was sore for three days afterwards, you know?  How many Asian guys have you hooked up with?  Oh, shit.  None.  None?  None?  None?  None?  What would you rather have?  Like, big Irish?  I had a half Asian once.  What was he had a half, though?  He was half Japanese.  And half what?  And half... 
[03:05:30]  Half...  Korea?  Regular.  Regular?  Half white, black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black, just like  a regular guy.  You know.  Yeah.  So he's white in Japanese.  You're trying to...  Cockazoid.  You're trying to figure out which half is which.  Right.  Then you ask him a math question and he doesn't get it.  You're like, ah, fuck.  That's the lower half.  Yeah.  We booked Spinal Tap today?  I know.  Why is Spinal Tap here?  Is that...  Oh, that's my crew.  That's your crew.  That's your...  That looks like Derek Smalls.  Yes, Derek Smalls.  Smalls.  You have a crew?  I have a crew.  Don't you have a crew? 
[03:06:00]  No.  Oh my God, you should have a crew.  It's so fun.  Kenny has a crew.  It's fun to have a crew, right?  Kenny's my crew.  Yeah.  Yeah, Kenny.  Do they travel with you?  Yeah.  Who are they?  They're my guitar players.  Because I play ukulele, I play songs.  Yeah.  On stage.  So they come with me on stage.  Has your career taken off since last Comic Standing?  I've done a couple of things, but could be taking off more, probably.  A little more taking off?  Yeah.  Hence, you're plugging someone else's book. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, exactly.  I haven't written my own book yet, so I'm plugging Lainey Spicer's book, Hottest Porn Stars.  You sure are into the world of smut there, Lainey.  Every time I see you, I know something smutty is going to be presented.  Even when, you know, we've got a nice girl here, but she's got to bring a smutty book.  See, people are remembering the boat people.  The Korean boat people.  I'm obsessed with this.  I'm obsessed with the boat people.  I don't know the boat people.  I'm telling you this.  First of all, they didn't go through the Panama Canal and come back around.  I think they all stopped in Frisco and, like, San Diego and shit. 
[03:07:00]  I think it was, like, because of the war or something.  When was the Korean War?  Holy shit.  How old are you?  Maybe they were Vietnamese.  Yeah, there was a Vietnamese flotilla.  Yeah, those are the boat people back in, like, the 70s and, uh, hmm.  Prior to the very funny bit on this.  And early 80s.  Might be the Vietnamese.  Yeah, it was the prior to funny bit on this.  That probably was the Vietnamese.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm trying to remember their eyes.  Trying to remember their eyes?  Yeah.  Vietnamese have nice eyes, too.  Really? 
[03:07:30]  Oh, yeah.  Not when they're staring at you down from the end of a rifle butt, smashing the bridge  of your nose in.  Yeah, they have nice eyes.  Let me tell you about that, my friend.  That wasn't too fun.  No, I would imagine it wasn't.  I was 11 years old.  Might have been the Vietnamese.  Why they put me in the war at 11, I'll never know.  Wah, wah, wah.  So, your guitar players travel with you.  Yeah.  Where's your ukulele?  This right here.  Oh, you got your little ukulele.  It's gotta be adorable.  Look at her. 
[03:08:00]  She's all little with her little ukulele.  I know.  Well, you think it's a ukulele.  Oh.  Well, you know what I have in here for real?  Vibrators?  Um, 9mm.  Oh, man.  I'm a spy.  MP5.  Yeah, I could see it.  That'd work great, though.  You could walk around.  No one would think.  You'd get hassled all the time, and then you could just shoot people.  Would you?  What?  Oh, in a second.  Yeah.  You look like a very tall person.  Anyway, is it true Koreans have big breasts? 
[03:08:30]  What?  Well, that's what's coming in.  I'm just trying to mash you a little bit.  What Asian country has the biggest breasts?  Um, I don't know.  Japanese.  Japanese, right?  Yeah, I had a Japanese roommate once.  I would say that's Samoa place.  D.  She had D's?  D's boobies.  Wow.  Nice.  Crazy.  I know.  Should we get our smiles in here?  You want to sing some songs?  This is your time.  Yeah, I want to hear you sing a song.  We like you.  Yeah.  You want to hear a song?  Yeah.  Okay.  Are they regular songs or are they funny songs? 
[03:09:00]  They're, um...  Regular?  They're parodies.  Okay.  Yeah, see, that's how I got my start in radio.  Yeah, right?  Yeah, I did.  Why is Roland making a weird face?  He was grabbing his...  Why are you grabbing your nose, Roland?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was Doc of the Bay, but it was OJ.  It was an OJ song.  It was an OJ Simpson song.  How are you?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Take a seat on the couch so we can get the festivities started.  Roland, what's wrong?  Allergies.  You're allergic?  What's wrong?  Got your allergies today? 
[03:09:30]  Poor Roland.  Mars, what's going on?  Why is everyone...  What?  Why isn't anyone talking?  What happened?  Everything all right?  Let me see your little ukulele.  That's my pickup line.  You know what?  We've been saying for years on this show we love ukuleles.  Really?  Oh, my God.  No.  We're fans of the ukulele.  Why?  It's underappreciated.  It just makes me feel like a much larger person.  Yeah.  That's great.  That looks great.  If you put it next to an Asian dick, it makes you feel better about yourself. 
[03:10:00]  It makes it look bigger.  Do you guys like Sam Cooke?  Oh, Sam Cooke.  I love Sam Cooke.  Yeah?  You love him?  Do you guys play Sam Cooke?  No.  No.  What Sam Cooke song do you like?  I like Twisting the Night Away.  Yeah.  What do you got there?  I have a version.  A tuner.  I have a version of it.  Fisting the Night Away.  How long have you been playing the ukulele?  Oh, like a year.  Oh, my God.  You just started playing the ukulele? 
[03:10:30]  Late in life?  What's wrong with you?  Why did you decide to start playing the ukulele?  Because I was carrying a guitar who's too fucking heavy.  That's a good answer.  Yeah.  Very good answer.  That's a great answer for a really serious interview.  Yeah, yeah.  Like a Larry King interview.  Guitar's too fucking heavy.  Guitar's too fucking heavy, Larry.  I would make Mark carry it everywhere.  Who's Mark?  Happily.  Remind me of my last week's entourage anytime. 
[03:11:00]  What's your background over there, sir, with the mustache thing?  Well, I play metal music and a lot of cover songs in some clubs.  I do crystal mining.  I'm not an old-fashioned hard rock miner, really.  What?  I'm a hard rock miner.  I'm a professional crystal miner.  He goes into quarries and digs up rocks.  A miner?  Well, I'm a miner.  What's the name?  Like Fred Flintstone.  I thought we had something in common.  Yes!  No, no, not miners.  Not like you.  That's different.  Have you found anything good?  Amazing stuff.  I got stuff in museums all over the world, yeah. 
[03:11:30]  Really?  I had it really big, yeah.  Is there money in it?  A lot of money.  Are you rich?  I got $40,000 from one pocket I hit last year.  Really?  What did you find?  We made that.  This gemmy green stone called Prenite, New Jersey State Gem.  Wait, how much was that?  I made $40,000 from the pocket so far.  We've made $40,000 since Esther came out.  Oh, Joe Opie.  That is just uncouth.  That's just a joke.  Maybe it has to.  Very cool. 
[03:12:00]  That's interesting.  Digging up the fucking crystals.  It's amazing what I do.  I see amazing, beautiful things in nature.  I'll tell you, I've really never been into Asian girls, but she's very cute.  You're adorable.  Very attractive.  The ukulele really sets it off.  Yeah.  Something about a hot girl and a Don Ho vibe.  That's me going.  A minor.  Okay.  How many of your relatives do nails? 
[03:12:30]  Oh, Jesus.  That's a question.  What's wrong with that question?  They're in the happy ending business, not the nails.  There's more money.  Yankee Cranky.  It's like faster turnaround.  You got some Yankee Crankys in your family tree?  No.  Just trying to get them out of the cast.  All right.  Here we go.  Okay.  So I have a song.  Have you been fisted before?  I have not.  I tap out at four fingers.  She looks right at Jimmy.  I've attempted to, but I'm just too much of a rookie.  Well, we have some extra time. 
[03:13:00]  Maybe we could get me a glove.  You know what the hardest part is?  It's not even getting the thumb in.  It's getting the fist to curl.  I've been on the giving end.  Oh, before you put it in?  No.  You put in four.  You work in four.  And then you ease in the thumb.  And then your hand kind of looks like you're picking up something.  Like you're picking up a dime.  Exactly.  Your fingers are all together.  And then the key is to kind of bring your fingers under and wrap your thumb around and  turn it into a fist.  It's like getting out of cuffs.  Handcuffs.  Yes.  Yeah, so you have like fucking, like, what are those stupid horse, like those little 
[03:13:30]  teeny crabs?  Horseshoe crab?  Fiddler crab?  Yeah, fiddler crab fucking legs.  You've got to put your fingers together like fiddler crab legs.  And then when you try to make their fist, a lot of times they're like, okay, okay, okay,  okay, okay.  I thought you put your fist in like this.  Like just punched?  Yeah.  Backed up and kind of just laid on in there.  Your rope-a-doper vagina.  Yeah, you probably could after they've been fisted a few times. 
[03:14:00]  I probably could, right?  That's really hard work.  You do a very small hands.  You've got to look sexy for Twitter because everyone's begging.  One, two.  Ah, not so sexy.  Oh, that's a good picture.  She's always sexy.  Come on now.  All right, I'll make my orgasm face.  Orgasm face.  You know what a girl's orgasm is?  Hold on, hold on.  How is that?  Holy shit, she's choking herself, crossing her eyes and sticking her tongue out. 
[03:14:30]  That's an orgasm face.  You know what I mean.  Are you on Twitter?  Are you choking the life out of her?  I am on Twitter.  What is that?  Esther underscore coo.  Ah, I hate the underscore people.  I fucking hate it too, but there's a fucking another Esther coo who has me.  My name.  I don't follow the underscore people ever.  How do you spell Esther?  E-S-T-H-E-R.  All right, okay.  A-S-T-H-E-R.  Underscore?  K-U.  All right.  Now people are going to follow you.  That's so easy to sign your name, your last name. 
[03:15:00]  It's just like a symbol.  All right, let's do this.  All right.  All right.  Let me tell you about the trick.  Don't even need a day.  Don't even need to be gay.  Fisting the night away.  If you are not alone, here's a trick you should know.  Rub a little old Crisco and start fisting the night away. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, fisting, fisting, everybody's feeling great.  We're double fisting, triple fisting.  Fisting the night away.  Right before I go to sleep, I always take it elbow deep.  Ain't no need to count the sheep.  Well, I'm fisting the night away.  Hey.  If you go too deep in my crack, you'll never get your Rolex back. 
[03:16:00]  My mom would have a heart attack from fisting the night away.  Yeah.  Fisting.  Everybody now.  Fisting.  Everybody.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fisting.  Fisting the night away.  Damn.  You're so dirty.  All right. 
[03:16:30]  I love that filth.  It's great.  Fisting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a song about fisting.  If only Sam Cooke could be alive, I can serenade him.  And see, yeah, see where his song has gone.  Yeah, that would be fantastic.  Esther is performing the, where are you performing?  Where's Rick's Cabaret?  Oh, that's the book party?  Oh, tomorrow night at Parkside Lounge on Houston and Attorney.  How's Lainey associated with this?  I'm confused. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, because, um.  I love Lainey, but.  Does she try to get you into porn or something?  I'm performing with a porn star, Alexis Ford.  Oh, okay.  Do you know her?  Oh, yeah, we know her.  She has, like, a super white butthole.  You can see it in the magazine.  It's beautiful.  Yeah.  She probably bleaches it, though.  I hate that.  I like a dark.  Yes, I do.  Dark.  You want a stained one?  Yeah.  Yeah, Jimmy likes it stained.  Yeah.  Like an old coffee mug.  Like you're redoing your coffee table.  Exactly. 
[03:17:30]  Because it's more natural, right?  Yeah.  I like a print when she gets up off the sofa.  Someone left a dime.  Oh, no, they didn't.  I do like that.  It's more natural.  Well, you know what?  Well, maybe it's all there.  White is right.  That's a very white asshole.  It's so white, right?  Yeah.  It's like pink.  That is pink.  Yeah, yeah, that is.  And around it is just the same color as her ass.  Yeah, it's all just white and stuff.  It doesn't fade into white and stuff.  No brownness or nothing.  That's awful.  Do you like that? 
[03:18:00]  I mean, she's really hot, but I prefer...  Sam, can you try that?  I prefer...  I never really thought of the preference of one or the other with that.  I used to talk dirty to this girl, and she would tell me how deep and dark her ass crack was.  I used to go fucking bananas for that.  I really do.  I used to go fucking bananas.  Wait till you go two more inches.  It gets really dark.  No, I do like that.  I think that's fucking sexy.  Yeah?  Yeah, dark nipples.  All that stuff is hot.  Esther, you got another song?  Yeah, I got another song. 
[03:18:30]  Should we do one?  Sure.  Yeah, all right.  About nipples?  I like dark areolas, sure.  What rhymes with that, though?  Coca-Colas?  I like the slow fade myself.  What do you got?  Okay.  We'll do a masturbation song.  Oh, that's good.  Okay.  Start on D.  Well, I got a rubber toy, and I'm using it every day now.  And I got no need for boys, cause I sit in my room, I'm playing now. 
[03:19:00]  I spend a hundred bucks on batteries, and what else can I say now?  And I'll have fun, fun, fun, till my mommy takes my dildo away.  In my father's dressing floor, underneath the lingerie, I found it.  So I ran into my room, moved it up, and started to pound it.  I hope I don't wear it out, cause I use it every time I'm around it.  And I'll just come, come, come, till my mommy takes my dildo away. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  Are these songs written out of personal experience?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  You know what?  I learned to masturbate late in life.  Why?  Do you know that Chelsea Handler learned to masturbate when she was eight?  I've heard some girls do very...  Oh, Uncle Paul.  I've heard some girls have very young, yeah.  Yeah.  They kind of figure it out and go like, whoa, that's kind of good.  How old were you?  Seventeen.  Wow. 
[03:20:00]  Wow, that's impossible.  Yo, for real.  You didn't have girlfriends that kind of told you about this thing?  I was at church.  Oh, God, that damn church.  You know?  And did you just lose your mind?  Yeah.  Was it like, that is what I'm doing all the time now?  Yeah, pretty much.  What made you do it?  Tim Allen's tool time.  Why?  Cause I was watching the show.  Why, did you see the ratings?  No, it was like, he bought his wife a jacuzzi on the show, and then she was like, the jet  strings are so strong, I don't need a husband. 
[03:20:30]  And then she went and took a bath, and then I tried it.  Oh, in the bath?  In the bathtub.  Yeah, see, that's a lot of girls first find out about the bath, that was the running  water, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, and it was trickling down.  Yeah.  And you're kind of doing some gymnastic move.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Or did you use the shower head?  No, no, no.  The bath.  The bath.  Nice, heavy flow of water.  Yeah.  That worked.  Fucking falling down like a waterfall.  Oh, my God, like crazy.  For a 17-year-old?  Of course.  Girls, yeah, a lot of girls have found out the first way like that with the water. 
[03:21:00]  I let the water hit my ball bag when I was younger.  It hurts.  It kind of hurts.  Stream of shower.  You should turn around and try your ass on the floor.  It kind of hurts.  No, then you can control the water, you know?  Oh.  Oh, man, yeah, a little gentler, a little...  Right?  Did you have to watch out that you didn't make any sound because your parents?  Yeah.  What's the worst part about that, living at home?  I know, and then I came out and my mom's like, you like to take a long bath?  Oh, so she discovered the same thing, huh? 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Do you think Mother knew?  I think so.  Yeah.  Did you see footprints already in the spot?  She's like giving me techniques.  Yeah.  You look up, you just see footprints, go, wait, those aren't mine.  She's telling her where to turn the knobs.  We're at five o'clock, two o'clock.  Esther, I'm tweeting that fine picture.  You can write the tweet, though.  It says, our new friend, the funny, and...  Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da. 
[03:22:00]  No, you...  Oh, I'm just going to write it.  You fill in the blank.  I'm letting you fill in the blank.  I got our new friend, the funny, and...  Crazy?  Crazy.  Yeah?  Yeah, why not?  How are you ready to let that go out like that, the funny end?  That would...  I know, right?  I wouldn't do that.  And crazy, uh...  Can I, like, do Korean or something?  What?  Was there a photo of her?  Korean what?  What are you... 
[03:22:30]  What?  He's the worst.  How am I the worst?  Do you hear what you say on this show?  I don't...  You get some crazy stuff coming out of your mouth.  I don't know.  This is my thing.  How come when I say it, people laugh.  When you say it, it's uncomfortable.  Well, that's me.  I know.  Are you uncomfortable?  I don't mean to make you uncomfortable.  No?  No.  Okay, good.  Something tells me it's very hard for her to be uncomfortable.  Yeah, she's hurt at all.  She sings about fisting.  You know what?  I'm going to just stay with Crazy.  Our new friend, the funny and crazy.  And then I put your Twitter thing, and then you get followers out of it. 
[03:23:00]  All right, continue.  Okay, thank you.  Yeah, I think Esther is fairly unoffendable.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  It's hard to be offended after you sing a song about dildos and fisting.  Yeah.  Yeah, I have a song about masturbating, and it ended up on a Brazilian porn site.  You didn't get any no?  No.  You didn't get any royalty checks or anything?  Wow, really?  Yeah.  You just stole your shit.  Did you send them a cease and de-fist? 
[03:23:30]  All right, Tim, that's not bad at all.  A little legal document joke.  Yeah, it's legal.  It's hard to tie in fisting and legality.  Did you send them a cease and de-sist?  Or did you let them just leave it there?  You could have.  I just put it up.  I just left it.  Oh, you didn't care?  Okay.  Am I supposed to?  You could if it's your stuff and you don't want to up there.  No, it's fine.  It's your creation.  They can't just take it and put blowjobs to it.  No, no, no, no.  No, I'm having orgasms in it. 
[03:24:00]  Oh.  Oh, is that music?  Oh.  No, it is music, but I'm having orgasms in it.  I'm coming to my music.  So it sounds really hot.  Yeah, okay.  Oh, we get it.  Get it?  You got an album out?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You want to plug the album?  Well, I saw them at my shows.  Where are you performing?  I'm at the Parkside Lounge tomorrow.  That's where you should be performing.  That's the lady thing, though.  What's wrong with that?  What?  Because we love you.  Esther doesn't need to plug anything to come in here. 
[03:24:30]  She could come in on my thing, because I know her.  I'm friends with her.  That's all right.  Well, so am I.  Oh, damn.  No, which is cool.  Damn, this is getting uncomfortable.  All right.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's fine.  You guys can have me on the weekend.  It's totally cool.  But as long as she knows, she could have got on either way.  I ran away from home.  But are you kind of touring around, though, too?  Kind of, yeah.  Not so much?  Well, I don't know.  I need to find somebody to open for. 
[03:25:00]  I would work with Esther.  Wow.  Yeah.  Someone should take you out on the road.  I don't have any headline gigs, though.  I'm just doing anti-social stuff.  I'm in Utah at the end of August.  No, Jimmy's got the big tour he's doing now.  I would certainly work with her.  I would certainly work with her.  By the way, you look good in yellow.  Really?  Why?  You're wearing yellow.  Brings out features.  Oh, boy.  My yellow skin.  I didn't say yellow skin.  You're wearing a nice yellow, you know, top. 
[03:25:30]  I don't think that.  You kind of have a tan.  Yeah.  You don't have yellow skin.  No?  I'll tell you who is.  No.  No, I won't.  You want to do another song, or?  Holy shit.  No, let's talk about buttholes.  I think we did that already.  More.  This is not enough.  More.  More.  Jimmy likes the stained ones.  We're still going.  Huh?  I don't think you can talk about.  You're never going to say we've talked about assholes too long.  No.  I think we can go with that for as long as you're comfortable with it.  Our audience is saying I've never had those assholes. 
[03:26:00]  No, I fucked it up.  Yeah, you did.  God damn it.  Hold on.  Oh, boy.  We had a perfect show tonight, too.  What happened?  I fucked up a line I was going to blurt out of my face, but I fucked it up.  Try it now.  No.  It's all in the timing.  Yeah.  Mars, you all right over there?  Absolutely.  There you go, Mars.  How come you have two guitar players?  I'm not saying that they're not good.  One can't play.  Oh, shit.  I love magic.  Wait, he can't play?  I can actually keep time, so that's where I'm at.  That's where I come at. 
[03:26:30]  So it's asymmetrical.  Probably if you're drowning.  Oh, okay.  Three is symmetrical.  The guitar players are fighting now.  That's why she's got two guitar players.  Is he really not that good?  Oh, he's terrible.  Horrible.  How do you?  You're going to let him say that?  Yeah, exactly.  Woody Harrelson and Sally?  No, they're awesome.  Crystal guy.  Are you going to let him say that?  Crystal guy.  Sounds like he's selling meth.  Because he's playing so loud, he thinks he's not good enough.  He plays too loud.  Do you think he's...  Well, he's playing too loud, so...  He's yelling at each other.  Her vocals were not that...  It was not that prominent, your vocals. 
[03:27:00]  Wasn't he too loud, though?  There was some guitar too loud.  Oh, that's why we couldn't hear Esther as well as we should have.  He was too loud.  I told you, but you don't listen.  But you're not a good guitar player.  I heard a climb in the mic.  Everybody stop fighting.  But wait, Esther, you have to pay...  Three of you get paid on the gigs?  I have to pay them in...  Kisses.  A little trade.  No, no.  You all get paid.  I give them nuggets of weed.  Where did you find these two?  Absolutely. 
[03:27:30]  In the park.  You hang out in the park?  Do you go to the park?  No.  I love this so much.  Do you go to the park?  I would assume Washington...  I would assume downtown, Washington Square Park.  I haven't seen you in the park.  No, I'm not in the park.  Not in Washington.  What park?  I would assume that's the place, because that's where all the creative people hang out.  Central Park.  Oh, Central Park.  Yeah.  Really?  No, Washington Park is like too skeevy.  Oh.  Yeah. 
[03:28:00]  What side of Central Park?  Just the perfect amount of skeeve.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's Central Park.  I was in Sheep Meadow yesterday.  Oh, you were?  But that's kind of more like family boring stuff.  And Frisbee players.  Yeah, that's what makes it fun.  Frisbee players?  Family boring stuff.  Oh, you like the family boring stuff.  Yeah.  You know how to sing about assholes and stuff.  These little babies come up to me while I'm singing fisting.  Wait, you sing in the park?  And they start dancing.  You sing in the park?  Yeah, that's where I met them.  They start dancing to the fisting song.  Right.  It's wonderful.  What part of the park do you perform in? 
[03:28:30]  In the middle.  Near, uh...  Jesus, I'm trying to help you out here.  Have you been in the middle?  What's in the middle?  Give me, like, a landmark.  There's no landmark.  It's all grassy.  So you just got to, like, kind of pinpoint it.  Like, far.  Like, that's the middle.  It's kind of like trying to find an asshole in the middle of the dark in the night.  You know?  Like, it's in the fucking middle.  Could you get a map of Central Park?  Is it near the Great Lawn? 
[03:29:00]  I don't know what that is.  The whole thing is a great.  No, it's in Sheep Meadow.  It is Sheep Meadow.  It's Sheep Meadow?  I've never seen any performers in Sheep Meadow.  Yeah.  Are you a real city girl like you are?  Oh, you just sit in the big grass area and hope people come up to you?  Yeah.  I don't care who comes up to us.  And you play your dirty songs?  What the fuck is going on?  That's our rehearsal space, the park.  Oh.  Why, you think that's weird?  A little bit, yeah. 
[03:29:30]  Why is this weird?  I'd rather do that.  It's not weird.  Yeah, you guys are looking at me like, what a freak.  Nah.  I give money to all musicians when I see them in the park.  No, we don't play for money.  They're not begging out there.  Why not?  Why not just have an open ukulele case and maybe get a few bucks out of it?  Maybe.  Maybe.  Fuck the gigs.  You're just using that as a practice space.  Yeah.  So you don't look for donations?  No.  Okay.  If you want to give us food, we'll take food. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah, food for an exchange for music?  Yeah.  Who's your manager?  We'll play for food.  Pod Brownie.  Do you have a manager?  Do they send you out on stuff?  They do.  Okay.  I did my first movie.  Oh, that's good.  Uh-oh.  A black movie.  Really?  Yeah.  What was it?  They're the best because everybody's laughing.  You do something funny, you know?  Yeah.  As opposed to like white crews, they don't laugh as much.  So what was it about?  Black people know how to laugh, man.  Right.  Don't blame me.  You're absolutely right.  Like when you had the black girls living in your house, did they laugh at you? 
[03:30:30]  No.  That's a good question, but no.  No?  No.  I was very young.  I don't remember she laughed.  What was the black movie?  She seemed very sad, actually.  Yeah, what black movie?  It's a sequel to The Cookout.  Really?  Have you seen it?  That means we had to see this.  No, I didn't see it.  We didn't see The Cookout.  Was it a black movie?  It was a black movie.  No, I'm serious.  It was a black movie.  Well, that's fair enough.  They cook food on the barbecue.  But that's like a black movie.  What are you doing?  Like black people do.  I was an Asian baby mama of the black basketball player.  Oh, shit.  Who played him? 
[03:31:00]  But did you have to do like stereotypical Asian stuff?  Yeah.  You did, right?  I had to be Asian.  Could you give us a little something?  No.  Over the time?  You don't want to, huh?  I'll give you my...  Give us one line.  What was the character?  No, but I had to like walk in with Wendy Williams.  Yeah.  And she's like interviewing me in the movie.  She's a big bitch.  And she's...  She's a big bitch.  So she sat down on the couch and then I went flying up.  And so she was like... 
[03:31:30]  She's a big bottom bitch.  She's like, you're not Asian.  She's big everything.  She's huge.  She looks like a tranny.  You're probably friends with her.  I'm sorry.  She was nice.  Okay.  That's fair enough.  I don't want to blow up your spot.  No.  Esther Kuh is on record saying she's really nice.  I'm sorry.  So you walk in with her.  I'm shutting up now.  So I have to just be Asian.  She's like, so how did you meet the basketball player?  Blah, blah, blah.  And I had to be like, oh, I don't know.  And you had to just...  You had to be like, oh, yeah, like little giggles and stuff. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  Bring shame to my people.  Esther Kuh rules.  Everything's shame.  Did it say in the sides...  How did it say to do that in the description for the sides?  It didn't give a description.  I just made myself Asian.  Oh, okay.  It didn't...  You just felt like you had to make yourself Asian.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know what they wanted.  You know what they wanted.  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  Like, I bowed to Wendy Williams.  Yeah.  You know.  Who played your boyfriend or husband?  Some guy.  Quantel. 
[03:32:30]  Anderson.  I don't know.  Some black guy.  But have you ever been with a black guy for real?  Like dating or nothing?  Well, there was one.  Uh-oh.  But they're huge.  Whoa.  They're dicks?  Yeah.  You got that far?  Right?  Oh, shit.  What?  Have you been with one?  No, no.  You said, whoa, like you were reminiscing your time.  No.  I just thought this out.  I like your comebacks.  I just have, like, words that come up like damaged goods. 
[03:33:00]  Things like that, you know.  So you had sex with her how many times?  No, I didn't have sex.  I just looked at it.  You looked at it and it scared you?  And I was like, are you fucking kidding me?  Yeah.  How big was it?  Whoa.  She's making the, um, that's like, yeah, that's about, she's giving, it's probably  about a big 10, 10 by 6.  No, that was more than 10.  She's exaggerating, though.  That wasn't too big.  Oh, so you got to knock down a couple?  Yeah.  It's like, if I'm going to be, I should start out with, like, a half black one.  Ah, yeah. 
[03:33:30]  Right?  Then it would, yeah, slowly work your way.  Like Barack Obama.  Go from, yeah.  Right.  Looking for a Barack Obama type.  Yeah.  Go from Asian to half.  A black with, like, an Asian mom or something.  Right, there's, like, a whole ladder you got to follow, you know?  If you don't want to, like, rip your vagina.  How do they show it to you?  You just asked to see it?  Were you kissing and you touched it?  No, no, no.  You just took it out.  Wow.  You just whipped it out.  That's how they are.  What do you like?  You know what I mean?  Like, Asian guys, they'll take, like, months and years before they take it out. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  Black guys are just like, yeah.  Black guys are just like, yeah.  What do you think?  What are we going to do about this?  What'd you think?  Right?  Did you like it on some level?  I was like, that's, I'm sure that'll fit into somebody.  You know, but not here.  Did you tug it a little?  No.  Come on.  Just a little tug?  Yeah.  A little, like, fart.  Maybe.  Maybe.  I don't remember.  I was lying.  Slapped it around a little bit.  I was lying.  You like pot? 
[03:34:30]  I love it.  Do you like it?  I haven't smoked in a while, but I might start again.  Yeah, let's go.  But I've been saying that for a couple years, though.  You got any, right?  Yeah, I don't know.  This is my front pocket.  That's what it's for.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Do you smoke every day?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Don't look.  A lot of people do.  Yeah.  Right?  I know.  Why am I embarrassed?  So maybe you're not Asian. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh, jeez.  I'm just fucking high.  Sorry.  She's just really high.  Sorry.  That's a good one.  By the way, you got 400 new followers in 20 minutes.  Really?  Yeah, that's how powerful we are.  Hello, followers.  Thank you for following.  The problem is then they unfollow you tomorrow, though.  So it's exciting for one day.  You fuckers.  They're really nasty.  Very nasty people.  So where are you performing?  Yeah.  Because you're at 10-15.  Yeah, we got 10 girls.  You're performing at Lainey's thing, which is what? 
[03:35:30]  Tomorrow night?  Tomorrow night.  Which is where and what time?  The Parkside Lounge tomorrow night on Houston at 8 o'clock.  And porn star Alexis Ford will be there.  Does Lainey own you?  She kind of has...  Where'd she go?  She kind of owns you, right?  She turned into somebody else.  Wow, you must be real high.  Quick, you could escape.  She owns you.  Yeah.  You're not a slave to her, are you?  You don't need us to rescue you.  You're not paying off a debt for coming over in a shipping container. 
[03:36:00]  She adopted me when I ran away from home.  It's 7 to 9 at Rick's Cabaret tomorrow.  Do you have any other gigs coming up?  I'm at Stand Up New York on Thursday night at 10.  That's the only one we had on the plug sheet.  We had Stand Up New York Thursday night, which is two nights from now, obviously.  Stand Up's a good club.  10 o'clock.  And you can go to her website, which is, I guess, estercrew.com.  Funnycrew.com.  Oh, funnycrew.com. 
[03:36:30]  I hope estercrew.com at least leads to that.  No.  You should probably get that as a page.  No, but this guy fucking bought it and tried to sell it to me.  How much?  What a bastard.  For $1,000.  What an asshole.  A comedian.  Who?  I forget his name.  Rich boss.  Some Asian guy.  An Asian comedian.  He's a Japanese guy.  A comedian?  Yeah.  Fucking tried to sell you a website?  What an asshole.  I know, right?  Is he in Japan or is he here?  No, he's here.  I'll punch your mouth for you.  Does he know karate?  No, I'm a fucking brown belt.  All right, then we're going to go find that guy. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  You're a brown belt?  I'm a taekwondo.  You want to fight?  Kick some ass.  Mars will fight.  Iraq will fight.  Ah, no!  You want to break a board or something?  What can he do?  I want to punch you.  I was nice to you.  What?  Can I punch him?  Well, if he wanted you to punch him, I wouldn't, you know.  Come on.  Can you punch Sam because he doesn't, you know, wear a 28-inch waist?  That's a reason.  Right in the arm, I think.  All right, he's closer, right? 
[03:37:30]  Yeah.  Is he your intern?  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Almost.  So he deserves to get punched.  Yes, he does.  Right?  He hopes to be an intern one day.  One day.  Make it good because then I post this.  So wait.  It's not good I delete it.  Because we're violent.  A Japanese people.  A Japanese comedian has your sight?  That's going to annoy me all day that a guy tried to sell her her fucking sight.  Right?  What a dick.  I wish you knew his name so we could never have him on the show.  We could badmouth him at this show.  And Esther, let it be known that I got scared and I didn't want to be punched by you.  Yeah.  I'll be.  You're a pussy.  Yeah, I was scared. 
[03:38:00]  Nobody's ever turned down my punch.  I was scared.  But you can punch.  Sam, are you scared?  Yes.  You have to stand up, Esther.  Stand up.  Yeah.  She is.  Put your weight into it.  Yeah, really.  Put your weight into it.  All right.  I guess so.  You don't have to really hit.  Our new friend Esther Koo is going to punch Sam.  Because she's a brown belt in karate.  Okay, wait.  Let's pick a place to punch you.  In the arm.  In the arm?  That's safe.  Is it?  I think so.  You're going to get a bruise tomorrow.  That's.  All right.  Where are you going to punch him?  Just show him before you punch him.

Oh, he laughed at you.  That ain't that bad.  Yeah, he's not.  Wait, that was your punch?  That wasn't a very good punch.  I know.  Come on.  I'm just worried about here.  You're dead.

Can you like kick him or something? 
[03:39:00]  Why kick?  Because it'll hurt more.  Yeah, kick him in the arm.  In the arm, though.  In the arm.  She just fell back into her chair.  Wait a minute.  Wait, let me take my shoes off.  Yeah.  All right.  Esther Koo's going to take her shoes off.  All right.  We must really like you because we should have went home 20 minutes ago.  Really?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.

She's a good kicker.

This was very interesting.  We like you, Esther.  Taekwondo skills and her ukulele skills and her just hanging out skills.  Don't be confused.  We really like you.  Smoking pot skills.  Yeah.  You really have a lot of shit going on.  Yep.  So, if you can see Esther at the book party, which is what night?  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Or if not...

So, if you want to go see Esther, she's very, very entertaining and a little crazy.  With the two guitar players that don't like each other.  You'll be playing too loud and you'll be playing badly.  Try to make it.  And I'll be in Chicago tomorrow at the Anti-Social Tour.  Obviously, Chicago Theater with...  With Uncle...  Oh, forget it.  With the Uncle Tour.  Uncle Social.
