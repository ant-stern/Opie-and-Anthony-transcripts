<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts' characteristically crude and sexually explicit introductions.  Opie recounted being labeled a "flip-flopper" for praising Obama to a Kennedy, sparking a discussion about a gym's locker room and a bizarre, nude Asian man with painted eyebrows and hair.  The conversation then shifted to Alex Rodriguez's perceived lack of effort with the Yankees, his alleged womanizing during the playoffs, and his no-trade clause.  A Detroit caller criticized the Yankees for postponing a playoff game due to a rain prediction that never materialized, further fueling the discussion of A-Rod's perceived narcissism and the Yankees' overall slump, including Jeter's injury.  The Cardinals-Giants series was also briefly mentioned.

The show then moved to outrage over exorbitant Rolling Stones ticket prices, contrasting this with their own experiences with affordable concerts in their youth.  A story about leaving their producer, Iroch, stranded in the parking lot after a Rolling Stones concert was recounted.  A video of a Syrian helicopter being shot down, with the audio filled with shouts of "Allah Akbar," was played, followed by disparaging remarks from the hosts.  The discussion returned to politics, focusing on Obama's presidency and the Benghazi attack, sparking a heated debate about race and politics, including accusations of racism leveled at both Obama and the hosts.  Numerous callers shared their opinions, with one caller highlighting the hypocrisy of voting based solely on race.  The conversation explored the historical context of racial politics in the US and the perceived double standards between white and black people expressing racist views.  The segment concluded with a mention of Hank Johnson and his controversial Guam statement.

A subsequent segment delved further into race relations and assimilation in America, using highly offensive language.  The hosts extensively mocked Congressman Hank Johnson's statement about Guam potentially capsizing.  A purported phone call from a woman named Donna complaining about deer crossing signs was initially believed to be genuine but later revealed as a prank, based on listener feedback.  A follow-up interview with Donna and the hosts' attempts to capitalize on the prank's viral success were discussed.  A listener call about a viral video of a man breaking his tailbone jumping onto a frozen pool was also included.  The segment also covered a jingle contest with some offensive submissions, issues with sponsors, and a further discussion about the "deer crossing lady" prank and its online impact.

A later segment focused on judging entries for an audio contest.  The entries included comedic audio pieces, notably one by "Sleeves" featuring a song about leaves and a video titled "The Leaf Shepherd," along with a comedic show summary and sexually suggestive material.  A significant portion detailed a conflict between staff members Sal and E-Rock, culminating in a physical altercation (E-Rock hitting Sal with a magazine).  Sal's frustrations with E-Rock's work ethic, feeling overworked and undervalued, and his perceived sense of entitlement were discussed. Clips from the Ron and Fez show, featuring their intern Dana's fear of Jim Norton and ageist comments about Anthony Cumia, were played, eliciting an angry reaction from the Opie and Anthony hosts.  A "Jocktober" segment reviewed the Colorado radio show "Magic 93.1," hosted by Mary and Chris Britt, highlighting their styles and a listener contest.  Listener-submitted fan art and comments, featuring explicit and offensive content, were also shown and discussed.

The final segment featured a listener's story about a man's leaf-raking methods, which led to a discussion about the listener's deleted Facebook page.  The hosts discussed ringtones, including one potentially based on a violent crime news story.  Audio clips from "Magic 93.1" were played, focusing on the hosts' reaction to Opie and Anthony's show.  The conversation then covered negative comments and images on Opie and Anthony's Facebook page, leading to its deletion, and a scathing article from the *Idaho Statesman*.  This led to further discussion about offensive listener behavior and past negative publicity.  The broadcast concluded with a brief mention of upcoming live shows and appearances by Anthony.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the hosts frequently used vulgar and offensive language, along with crude jokes and discussions about graphic sexual content and violence.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Rules are destroyed, and conventions burn the crowd.  Would you like to make the fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  He's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted?  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horns should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:00:30]  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Oh, you want to hear the greatest of all?  Double gone, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We sure come off looking silly in those intros.  Come off looking very silly.  There's a lot to live up to.  I'm a mental patient, apparently. 
[00:01:00]  Apparently?  Yeah, well, okay.  You're a flip-flopper.  Oh, a mouth flip-flopper.  You told the Kennedy yesterday that Obama's the Messiah.  Well, I didn't want to upset a Kennedy.  They've been upset so much throughout their lives.  Who am I?  They've had the privileged life.  The privileged life.  Wow, that's kind of loud, isn't it?  Something's loud.  There we go.  The music was a little loud. 
[00:01:30]  That's better.  Ah.  Hi, everybody.  Morning.  Hi, people.  Out there.  In there.  Cars driving.  I see you.  I see you driving.  Who's that guy in front of you?  Go around him real fast.  Cut him off and smash him into the guardrail.  Go ahead.  Let's wake up.  I need something.  I need...  I don't know.  I need to wake up.  Crystal meth? 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  A little bump of meth?  Never did meth.  Crystal meth?  Is meth good?  No.  None of those drugs are good.  Do you need to be tickled?  That helps sometimes.  Tee hee.  When a friend comes over and gives you a little tickle.  Oh, boy.  Too much working out.  Oh.  Me and Jim work out at the same gym.  And I know it's just a matter of time.  One of us is going to be almost nude in front of the other one.  If not completely nude.  Like, who'd tell?  Do you walk around the locker room nude? 
[00:02:30]  Never.  No.  I don't nude.  I'm not paranoid about that, but there's one guy I see in that locker room.  And a lot of times he's on his phone.  And I'm like, is he trying to fucking...  It's really weird where he sits.  And I get so fucking annoyed at this one creepy bald guy.  There's a few nudes at our gym.  Have you come across the Asian guy?  The Asian guy?  Mm-mm.  That paints his eyebrows and his hair?  No.  Oh, God.  Wait till you see him.  Paints his eyebrows?  Yeah.  It almost looks like it's not even just for men. 
[00:03:00]  It almost looks like it's shoe polish.  Like Uncle Leo?  Hello!  And he's got a giant Asian bush.  Oh, God.  A giant.  With what amounts to...  Hmm.  Like, I don't know.  See, like, my pinky?  And this giant bush.  And he loves walking around the locker room nude. 
[00:03:30]  And then he gets in front of the mirror with his black paste.  And he paints his eyebrows and his hair.  Wow.  He really...  You haven't seen this guy yet?  Oh, wait till you see this one.  He's a treat.  Huh?  He paints them?  Paints.  That's weird.  And then when he's done, it's so dark, it looks ridiculous.  And he does it once a week, probably.  Once every week and a half.  I like to paint my eyebrow on. 
[00:04:00]  Like to look just like a famous character from Yeri Seinfeld.  The Uncle Leo.  Fucking Asian music stinks.  It's terrible.  You can't listen to this.  And then Jimmy has to rub it in, because there's a girl that works at the food area.  Yeah.  Who hates making vegetable juices.  Or when I order the vegetable juices, because it's a pain in the ass and they have to clean  out the machine and stuff. 
[00:04:30]  I know.  So I gave Jimmy the big warning about this broad, because she really has an attitude if  you ask for a juice.  And then it turns out that this girl loves Jimmy.  Oh.  And already goes, Jimmy, you're regular?  Oh, wow.  And I get the complete opposite vibe from her.  I always...  And I swear to you, I'm way nicer when I'm walking around the streets than I am in here.  Oh, gee.  There's nothing I did to this girl or woman to make her act that way.  So I have no idea what it's about.  But she loves Jimmy. 
[00:05:00]  And Jimmy had to text me.  She loves me.  I couldn't believe...  I thought it was very funny, because I was prepared for a confrontation.  I'm like, because I get a vegetable juice every day, I'm like, she's going to be awful.  Right.  But she was actually...  I'm like, okay.  And then she's friendlier.  Yeah.  And then one day, she memorized...  You know, like, you give the card, and they put your...  We all have a card for this, Jim, and they put your number in, and you can charge it to  your account.  And she memorized my number.  Whoa.  I want to hand her my card.  She's like, no, I remember it.  No one has memorized...  Wow.  She digs you. 
[00:05:30]  She digs you.  Yep.  She's got to be a fan.  Because I'm telling you, she's not even come close to memorizing my number.  Oh, shit.  She'll take the big metal bowl where she collects the vegetables and slams it on the  counter.  What do you want?  Oh, it's so uncomfortable.  Hi, Jimmy.  It's exactly what's going on between us two and this girl or woman.  And it's gotten to the point, I don't order vegetable drinks anymore over there.  You're too uncomfortable.  So she succeeded.  She doesn't want to make me vegetable drinks, so I'm way too uncomfortable watching her attitude. 
[00:06:00]  So I go somewhere else and get my vegetable juices.  I was so hyper-aware of it, because I'm like, all I'm going to do is order vegetable juice  from her.  Yeah.  Like, if she's going to be really nasty, I'll just get in trouble.  She seems to enjoy making you your vegetables.  Yes.  But of course, Jimmy has to write me.  Let me try to find it real fast.  I said she loves it.  I couldn't believe how nice she was.  Let me find it real fast.  Oh.  Okay.  Jimmy writes, the Asian one you hate at the gym loves, in big letters, capital letters, 
[00:06:30]  loves me.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  She just called out, Jim, the regular juice?  Yeah.  I get vibes from her.  I guess.  She could be hot, but she's not.  Well, then, you said something like that.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I have to go back again.  Sorry.  Okay.  I wrote, of course.  And then, can I?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Then Jimmy writes, her mouth is horrific looking. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Oh, no.  And then I go, and she has man's shoulders.  And then Jimmy goes, Jesus, I didn't even notice that.  Oof.  And then I wrote, of course you didn't notice that.  That was real funny.  I didn't notice her man's shoulders.  I go, of course you didn't.  For the course.  What else is going on?  A-Rod's out of New York, man.  They just traded him.  Really?  Yeah.  I missed that one.  Yeah, he's traded.  Oh, damn it.  It was kind of a weird time to trade A-Rod, but they did. 
[00:07:30]  Goodbye.  When did the Yankees resume playing?  Actually, this afternoon.  What, was there a little rain delay yesterday?  There was a no-nothing delay.  There was a radar big thing of green that was moving toward Detroit.  Wait.  So they postponed the game until today, and it didn't rain.  What do you mean it didn't rain?  It didn't rain.  Can't they call their neighbors to the fucking west and go, what do you got over there?  They saw a big thing of rain moving toward Detroit, but then decided to not have the 
[00:08:00]  game, and it never rained.  I do that for my family who live on Long Island.  Really?  Because, you know, the weather hits the city, obviously, first, and then I'll call them  and warn them and go, you better batten down the hatches.  How do you know it's not moving north?  Because sometimes it just moves and skirts the city and goes north.  When you live in the clouds, you know how they move.  You live in Cloud City?  I live way up in the clouds.  Cloud City.  No, I guess A-Rod's not traded, but most of the sports guys are saying there's no way  this guy comes back to New York. 
[00:08:30]  They're clamoring about it.  But he has a no-trade clause, right, Travis?  The Yankees are in a weird fucking time right now.  Yes.  No-trade clause.  So he could fucking...  Yeah, I mean, he can say no to anything.  He could fuck up everyone's world here in New York.  Yeah.  Because no one wants him in New York anymore.  It's obvious.  Mm-hmm.  It's pretty fucking obvious.  There's very, very few teams that they could trade him to.  Well, the Yankees would eat most of the contract, I would assume.  Yeah, but even still, I mean, there's a few teams that would give the Yankees something  significant for him and also pay. 
[00:09:00]  What about Seattle?  No.  Really?  He was already there.  What about Miami?  I think Miami's the place he would go.  Really?  Be the big star down there in Miami?  He's very big in Miami.  And he loves the gals down there.  Miami needs to sell tickets.  Oh, the girls.  Because they've got players that they could trade and still come out losing money and  payroll by taking them on.  Wow.  But he could say no.  Yeah, your Yankees are in a weird spot.  They're in a weird spot, man.  The whole team's in a fucking slump. 
[00:09:30]  Jeter's out for now, what, fucking six months?  He's done.  Four to five months.  Four to five months or whatever it is.  Broken ankle, right?  Broken ankle.  He's going to have surgery now.  He's going to have surgery.  And they're saying he's not going to make the start of the season at this point.  He might not.  I mean, if it takes him longer to heal.  Baseball, 162 games.  Now you get to this point where you tried all year to get to, and then you just fucking  fall apart as a team.  It's so strange.  It really is.  It just shows you the season is just way too long.  They're just tired.  And then you've got the A-Rod situation. 
[00:10:00]  He won't play again this year.  There's such a...  No.  No.  No.  When they didn't pinch hit him in game three, he was done.  They're not going to...  They're going to sit a guy that makes that much money.  They'll sit the rest of this.  That's just amazing.  Alex didn't play game three?  He didn't play game three.  He was going to be benched last night.  He wasn't in the lineup last night.  He ain't going to be playing.  He was available as a pinch hitter in game three, and they didn't.  You think they're secretly pissed off that he was flirting with those girls?  Yes.  Secretly?  Absolutely.  It's more than secretly.  Not really.  No one's really saying much. 
[00:10:30]  Well, yeah.  I mean, Girardi's not going to come out and say, like, I'm really pissed off.  No.  Girardi hasn't said a word about it.  That's so disrespectful.  That's what I mean secretly, because it's not really on the sports pages.  Trying to get phone numbers when you're fucking bombing at 28 million a year in the playoffs?  You do twat?  Yeah, the sports writers are all about it, but not the team itself.  If his slump didn't bench him, that...  Just think about it.  You know, you can't be in his position like that and be tossing phone numbers around and  not have the fucking manager just lose his mind over it. 
[00:11:00]  In the playoffs, it tells you all you need to know about this guy.  Yeah, he's a hateable guy, man.  He's a hateable fucking guy.  He's got a horrible character.  Very egocentric.  He's...  Yeah, he's...  But he is being humiliated.  This is humiliating.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's humiliating to Girardi and the team, but mostly Girardi, yeah.  Especially for A-Rod, it's humiliating, because maybe...  Yeah, but you know what?  I don't really think he cares.  Dude, you can't be that arrogant and be that fucking big in the game and not be humiliated  you're being benched. 
[00:11:30]  Dude, that's fucking devastating.  Absolutely.  But you know what?  And what was his statement?  His statement was something like, you know, if there's a lineup with me in it, it's a better  lineup.  Yeah.  So he's kind of not saying, well, you know, I'll sit, whatever Joe wants to do.  Like, he's starting to push back a little bit.  He's a scumbag.  It's just a bad fucking situation.  He's a scumbag.  Fucking baby.  He's bombed every postseason except, I think, one everywhere he's ever played.  And you know, when you bring up players, there's always someone to defend them. 
[00:12:00]  Sure.  We've never taken a call from someone defending A-Rod.  Yeah, true.  That's really strange.  Mike in Detroit wants him badly.  Mikey.  Hey, morning, boys.  Good morning.  What do you got, buddy?  I'm just wondering if Carlin was profit and shit.  I mean, what is this pussification of a pre-rain delay?  The city waits and waits.  We got Yankees on the ropes.  I mean, did Detroit come up with this thing that we're short on handcuffs just in case we  win?  There you go. 
[00:12:30]  What the fuck is that all about?  You play the goddamn game.  It fucking rains.  And then...  You pull the tarp out.  Yeah, exactly.  I actually wanted to watch some of that game.  And I saw, like, you were talking about the big green.  They were calling it the green monster storm, whatever.  And you could tell it was moving to the east.  So I'm with Mike.  You start the game.  You do the rain delay.  It looks like it's moving through.  So you might have to sit an hour.  Do you want a real explanation as to why they do this?  Because there was such a great chance that it was going to rain, and it was going to rain 
[00:13:00]  for a while.  That why would either team want to start the game, get two or three innings in, and then  have a two or three hour rain delay and completely lose your starting pitcher?  Because he's not going to come back out of your wrestling for two or three hours.  So do you really want CeCe Sabanthea?  That's part of the game.  That's what they do during the regular season.  They should have started the game.  It's the postseason.  They want to get the best chance possible.  Yeah, but it's up to Major League Baseball, though.  Sure.  And they should have decided to wait it out.  I'm saying they probably should have decided to play this. 
[00:13:30]  Imagine this is the future.  This is the future.  Sure.  The Yankees moving on to the World Series.  You've got to wonder if taking that one day off just completely stopped the momentum  of Detroit.  They're going to be wondering about that as they watch the World Series.  Well, okay, no.  It's not this time.  Future Jimmy, no?  No, not at all.  Oh, future Jimmy says no.  No, this is done.  Yeah, I know.  Fucking throwing a ball and give me a number while he's being fucking two for 30 in the 
[00:14:00]  playoffs?  He doesn't give a fuck.  What a hunk of fucking shit this guy is.  That must be a great way to go through life.  He don't care.  Nope.  It's all about him.  It is all about him.  Good luck to you.  Fucking narcissistic.  That's why I hate the Yankees and I hated the fact, but even still, he does not deserve  to be on that team because when he signed that huge deal with Texas, he did it because  he wanted the huge deal.  And then when he realized that he would never be able to win down there because all their 
[00:14:30]  money was into him, he wanted to be traded.  I want to go to a winner now.  Well, but you made that decision.  You wanted to be the highest paid player ever.  Yeah.  You took all the money away.  You killed that team's chances.  Yeah.  So you decided.  He didn't deserve to go to the Yankees.  He should have stayed in Texas and just lost for the rest of his life because that's the  bed that he made.  But he's a fucking.  Yeah.  You can't have it both ways.  You can't have a monster contract and then assume you're going to also win.  Exactly.  Well, although it happened in New York. 
[00:15:00]  So what am I saying?  Yeah.  But he didn't.  But he knows he's joking.  He knows he's fucking swinging.  Yeah, but what does he do about it?  He fucking flirts with girls.  Yeah.  He fucking flirts with girls.  Does he really know it?  That's what I'm asking.  Yeah, he does.  He should be talking with a batting coach every day.  Stubbing the tapes.  And he's in there.  He should be fucking, yeah, talking with the other guys.  What am I doing?  Give me some pointers.  True.  Oh, well.  So they're playing tonight?  They resume four. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  We're not acknowledging the other series.  The Cardinals beat the Giants.  Take a 2-1 series lead.  Game four tonight.  Yep.  Well, that's about all we have on that.  There's the Giants Cardinals coverage.  Huh?  Yeah.  I said, there's your Giants Cardinals coverage.  Yeah, there's your coverage.  Well, we don't really...  That's fine.  Mad Dog will talk about the Giants.  Yeah, we don't cover baseball that much.  We'll just give you the basics, I guess.  But the A-Rod story is pretty big because it's off the sports pages.  I hate when they say that. 
[00:16:00]  I hate when they say that.  It's gone from the back page to the front page.  Ripped from the headlines.  No, he's right.  From the back page to the front page.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Fans outraged over how expensive Rolling Stones tickets are.  I just looked down and saw that.  Why are they outraged?  How much are they?  Because they're expensive.  How much?  A million dollars each.  I think it'd be a hard time I would have thought.  It's crazy.  I think the cheapest seat is $100.  These are for the Jersey shows.  Right.  This story is about the London shows.  They're $400 for the cheapest seat. 
[00:16:30]  Wow.  But how about this?  They're $70.  Yeah.  They're really old men and they're still playing.  What happened there?  That video.  I was watching it yesterday.  What is it?  What is it?  Apparently it's a helicopter Syrian helicopter and it was hit and it's spinning out of control  and then it just blows up in midair.  And if you listen to the fucking audio of it, ugh.  A Syrian helicopter?  Allah Akbar!  Allah Akbar!  Allah Akbar!  Yeah. 
[00:17:00]  They're just fucking screaming like the fucking Lord of the Flies feral children they are.  Wait.  A Syrian helicopter was shot down by who?  I guess by some fucking, you know, badasses.  Oh, Libyan shot down a Syrian helicopter.  I don't know who shot down what, but I just know the people that shot it down were just  screaming that Allah Akbar.  That horrid language. 
[00:17:30]  That's a different one.  That isn't even it.  That's a different one.  But then there's, it's like, no, the other one, there are a bunch of them.  And then when it blows up, they're just, oh, Allah Akbar, oh, Allah Akbar, they're all yelling.  Fucking, just, ugh.  Shut up.  It's the same one you just played.  Oh, that's the same one.  Gotta look at the date. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, Allah Akbar!  Oh, Allah Akbar!  Oh, Allah Akbar!  You never see that during a fun thing.  No.  Like, you never see a birthday party, everybody's yelling, oh, Allah Akbar!  Oh, Allah Akbar!  Ever.  You never want to hear that.  They're never.  Imagine being out on a New York City subway and all of a sudden you hear that.  Oh, great.  That's the one.  Listen to these fucking animals.  Oh, God.  Oh, right. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, Sam, you just find the wrong one every time.  The aircraft can be seen spiraling from the sky after being hit by heavy artillery fire.  Yeah.  Before bursting into flames over the northwestern city of Idlib.  Do they ever have fun over there? 
[00:19:00]  Never.  Get a smartphone.  Holy shit.  Never.  And these guys might even be right for shooting down this area.  I don't even know which.  Right.  It probably were right to shoot it down.  It seems to be an exhausting way to live your life.  Oh, my God.  Doesn't that just seem exhausting?  You're constantly, oh, Allah Akbar!  Oh, Allah Akbar!  And all you're doing is trying to go to the market to get some, oh, man.  Yeah.  I just wanted some marmalade. 
[00:19:30]  Right.  You got to deal with this always.  There's one guy that can't get into the whole fray and he just like every 4th of July just lights a firecracker.  Hello, Akbar!  Hello!  He just freaks out at a pinwheel.  And they're like, you're not getting it.  We think Humzy is retarded.  He doesn't know when to use it.  Yeah.  He holds the firecracker and yells, Allahu Akbar!  Ow!  Allahu Akbar!  Beeps his horn at someone.  Hello!  He just uses it all the time inappropriately.  Yeah, they don't get it.  And everybody slices an orange in half. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh!  They're like, you're not supposed to always yell that.  You're annoying us with it.  You're really taking the edge off of it.  Only on special occasions, right?  Yeah, yeah.  You're taking the edge off of the whole thing.  You're taking the sting away from the world.  Yes.  But then he sees some Americans getting killed and he goes, oh, nerds!  I'm like, no, this is what you're supposed to yell.  Right, finally you can use this.  Go.  It's all about Detroit today.  Chris in Detroit, what's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  I'm just driving on the freeways on the way to work on that bone-dry concrete here. 
[00:20:30]  Ah.  I don't know where the hell the rain came from, but I was expecting to see an earth out in  the water this morning and nothing.  It is odd to just...  So it didn't rain at all?  Nothing.  You know, it might have sprinkled a little bit, but...  But they could certainly play baseball in it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, go Tigers, man.  Oh, boy.  Absolutely.  Punch it out, boy.  All right.  Why, oh, boy.  I'm not a Yankees fan.  I know.  Well, I'm surely a baseball fan.  I'm sure Detroit likes hearing that.  You don't have a good track record.  I don't know if you know that. 
[00:21:00]  I know.  That's why I didn't text you.  I wanted to text Travis so bad.  You should have.  It doesn't matter.  I know how much he loves the Orioles, but I just knew that he would, like, turn it against  me.  Text me next year.  It's fine.  Yeah?  Before the season?  Sure, if you want.  When the games don't matter as much?  Yeah.  All right.  That's it for your sports break.  Oh, so the Rolling Stones tickets are $400 a piece?  I think those are the cheapest ones in the UK.  I know that the cheapest ones in Jersey are $100, and those are probably, you know, the absolute 
[00:21:30]  worst seats.  But we've been paying about $100 per ticket.  Yeah, but then they go up to, like, $1,000.  Man, I remember.  I mean, I guess it shows our age, but, God, I think we went to concerts for $6 or $7.  That's crazy.  What concert's that?  Every show when we were growing up.  My God.  When did they just get out of control?  About what year?  I remember.  It drastically changed.  I mean, maybe it wasn't $6 or $7, but it certainly was barely $10.  You could go see pretty much any show you wanted.  I would say early 2000s, because I'll go back and look at my concert tickets from, like, 
[00:22:00]  the 90s, and they're still reasonably priced, you know?  And then, how do they get away with that?  Who started this?  Live Nation and Ticketmaster?  Spirit Ticketmaster!  I remember Rush Ticketmaster.  Oh, boy, you know what?  You fast-forward a bunch of years.  You know, I went to that Pearl Jam show down in Philly.  They love sponsorships.  Oh, yeah, huh?  You can't deny that, Travis.  They've changed their tune on that whole thing.  They give up. 
[00:22:30]  Big, huge Budweiser fucking logos everywhere.  Well, it was the Budweiser Made in America Fest.  But they didn't have to accept a spot in the Made in America Budweiser show.  You are right about that.  When I was in high school, and I wanted to go see Rush, I might have been in junior high,  it was $30 tickets, and that was a scalper, $30 tickets, and that was expensive.  That means the actual ticket probably was $15-ish.  $15 or $12.  Yeah.  So that was expensive.  But who started?  Was there just something that happened where all of a sudden they said, yeah, we can finally  start charging a lot more for our shows? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, I think so.  I mean, you look at sports contracts, same thing.  You know, they weren't insane until the late 90s.  Right.  And now they're just out of control.  Ticket prices out of control.  But then they don't sell tickets, and they have $10 lawn seat days where you can get any  ticket at PNC or in Camden for $10 because nobody's buying these.  We saw the Stones in Giant Stadium, trying to remember what year that was.  Were we back on satellite at that point, you think?  We were, right? 
[00:23:30]  Was that the concert I left you at, Iroch?  I swear to God, I'm using you just to try to figure out what year that was.  2005.  2005.  Eric remembers the minute you guys went to go see that concert.  You're all defeated.  2005.  Meaning that's the year I finally realized you're an asshole.  2005.  People that don't know, Iroch, it was a misunderstanding, but he was left in the parking lot of the 
[00:24:00]  Rolling Stones show.  A misunderstanding?  Yeah, a little misunderstanding.  It happens.  You know what's funny?  You went to Giant Stadium, and then you left Iroch there, and he had to take three buses  to get home.  How many buses did you have to take, for real?  I think Sam's exaggerating.  Two buses and the subway to get back to Brooklyn.  Wow.  It wasn't much of an exaggeration.  What a fuckover that was on Iroch, man.  Wow.  That was bad.  What were the circumstances?  Why did that happen?  Oh, I remember, because it was funny. 
[00:24:30]  You know what's funny about that is that Eric started working for you in 2004.  So that means it took you less than a year to start just completely fucking with Eric.  To totally fuck him over.  We just figured at the time it would be hilarious if he walks to where the car used to be.  Yeah.  You were right.  And just see a blank space there.  Yeah, but then the second part is also has to find his own way home from New Jersey.  You are in just a few spaces down watching him and saying, all right, get in.  You really left. 
[00:25:00]  Why is this really funny?  Yeah, because see, that's the, like the...  I'm not that guy anymore, by the way.  The person...  I'm very responsible.  The person who has a soul.  Yeah.  Like, they go, yeah, that would be funny to see him, you know, see an empty space where  the car used to be.  But like Anthony says, you watch from a couple spots down and then you drive over to him  and go, gotcha, Nago.  All right, get in the car.  Yeah, I always hated those type of pranks, though.  If you're going to do it, you got to go all in.  Exactly.  It's really funny.  It's not this, oh, he looks around the parking lot and sees my car sort of in the distance. 
[00:25:30]  That's not fun.  That's stupid.  Right.  It's really funny because everyone talks about doing it, but nobody actually leaves.  Well, my logic at the time, I remember from the Giants' parking lot, you could actually  see the city skyline.  So I figured, oh, it's right there.  It's right.  The tallest building is right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't even think it's more than...  How many miles is it, E-Rock?  Maybe six miles, how the bird flies?  Yeah.  Yeah, if you go across the water, it's only... 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, E-Rock could have just swam home.  All right, it's less than five, probably.  It's probably like three miles.  As the crow flies, go ahead.  I was going to go with Dodo Bird.  What were you doing?  I was thinking of through the tunnel as the elephant walks.  All right.  You know, Tommy...  Dodo Bird.  But Tommy in Florida makes a very good point.  Tommy.  Hey, that was a good thing with E-Rock.  E-Rock is, he should take comfort in knowing that you're good with it now, and you're over  it.  Yeah, I'm over this. 
[00:26:30]  We're good.  Are you good with E-Rock?  Yeah, I'm totally good, man.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, things are much better now.  Good.  Yeah.  Good.  You're done.  You're over it.  Yeah.  E-Rock, you're over it, right?  Glad you're over it.  Well, it's much better, because now there's just a mutual respect of employees.  Yeah.  And, you know, it's not the hero worship that it was years ago.  That was very awkward.  Yeah.  It certainly was.  That was the day that you found out E-Rock won't just sit there and take anything lying 
[00:27:00]  down.  That's right.  No, he'll stand up for himself.  He learned his lesson that day.  Yes, he did.  The reason the tickets are so expensive in Jersey for the Stones is because it's a pay-per-view  event.  Well, why would that make tickets a lot of pay-per-view, but that doesn't...  It has nothing to do with it.  It's probably expensive because in Giants...  It's expensive because it's the Rolling Stones.  Yeah, they could do Giants Stadium, so Prudential Center is way smaller, which means less tickets,  so they've got to charge more to get Giants Stadium-type money.  You've got to go see the Rolling Stones every time.  They're going to make like $25 million off these four shows. 
[00:27:30]  That they just pile into their bank accounts they don't even know exists.  They're so rich, they don't even know about bank accounts.  That's what people are complaining about.  They actually have to sit down with a guy, and that guy has to explain, oh no, we've got  bank accounts all over the fucking world for you guys.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Plenty of cash.  Yeah.  All right.  Cray.  Cray-cray.  That's cray.  I can't believe you support Obama now. 
[00:28:00]  That was weird.  Oh, that was last...  That was yesterday.  With Rory Kennedy.  Rory Kennedy was in here, and she started going off about Obama and working with Obama.  And it was hard for me to just sit here.  I couldn't go, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Even if I went, mm-hmm, people would be like, oh man, Anthony, what are you doing?  Right.  So I just decided I'd jump in and support him and the democratic side of the whole thing. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  The funny thing is, we throw each other, all of us throw each other under the bus all the  time.  You went with that angle, and the look you gave me was the funniest thing all day.  Unfortunately, no one got to see it, because we don't have a visual element.  But you looked at me like, don't you dare.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  But you gave me this look like, don't you even fucking go there.  Yeah.  I'm going with this angle, and just leave me the fuck alone.  I'm just going with it. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Well, I made up for it on Twitter last night.  Holy shit.  I should take some of the people's advice, because I get a lot of tweets that are like,  Anthony, why do you bother?  Why are you trying?  Why do you listen to these people?  Why do you do this?  Why do you argue?  But that's what Twitter's all about.  I was just, I got into this, and then I realized it's such a dumb fucking argument,  because it wasn't even about real issues or anything.  It was about the, did Obama call the bombing, or the attack on Benghazi a terrorist event? 
[00:29:30]  Right.  And all the Obama fucking people are saying, yes, he did.  I'm saying, no, he didn't.  He mentioned that the United States would not, you know, bow to terror, you know, whatever  the actual quote is, it didn't have anything to do with this, the attack on Benghazi.  It was a general statement of how America reacts to terror.  But then I tried to have people, I said, well, then explain to me, if he did bring it up in the  Rose Garden right after it happened, the next day, why then for two straight weeks was the 
[00:30:00]  White House blaming the video for this, not even attack for what happened there?  They didn't even call it, like, it wasn't a real concerted attack.  Because they fucked up.  Yeah, but no one's saying that.  Now they're trying to cover their ass because it's an election year.  The Obama fucking fans are the ones that just, they will not accept it.  They will not accept that he, him, and the rest of the White House, and everybody under  him thought that this was a response to a video, or actually misled everybody by saying 
[00:30:30]  it was a response to a video, knowing that it wasn't, which I think is more accurate.  And both sides do this.  I mean, obviously Bush knew those planes were going to hit the fucking Twin Towers.  Oh, Jesus.  He did nothing about it.  So, both sides do this stuff.  Oh, Jesus.  What does motive be for lying?  Because I'm not saying he didn't lie, but what would his motive be?  There's a few things.  Because he doesn't want to show weakness. 
[00:31:00]  Doesn't want to have a terrorist event on his watch, close to the election.  So close to an election, you don't want to show any type of weakness.  Why didn't they see it coming?  You guys try to, you know, cover this shit up.  You know, it's just one of those things.  You know why?  Because of something we said yesterday.  This fucking country doesn't want any type of honesty ever.  No.  They want to be told what they want to hear.  I would respect Obama way more if he goes, you know what, we have everything in place,  but sometimes we're just going to miss one or two. 
[00:31:30]  People don't want to hear that.  And unfortunately, we missed this, and we're going to learn from this.  That's scary.  People don't want to hear that shit.  Of course not.  So, there's your answer, though.  That's the why.  Yeah.  Because that's the only other option.  Yeah.  So, you've got to do the other thing, and you've got to, like, you know, cover up,  and then you go, whoa, you did say the word terror that day, so we can fucking play off that.  Yeah, that's exactly it.  It's all semantics.  And, I mean, I've watched the video.  I've listened to him in the Rose Garden the next day, and he was talking about general violence 
[00:32:00]  against the country will not be tolerated.  Not, this was a terrorist event.  He didn't say that.  And you know what?  How about this fact, then?  If you won't eat that, how about this?  The fact that his speech was so vague that it wasn't clear, that, to me, isn't very presidential.  That we're even arguing what he said, what he didn't say.  How about the fact that he should have come out, then, if he called it a terrorist event, 
[00:32:30]  and called these people terrorists, and made it clear what it was.  Because it's just as bad if he did call it a terrorist event, and everyone's still arguing about it.  Because he didn't make himself clear then.  But you just argue with these people on Twitter.  Oh, relentless.  Good luck with that.  It's just too much.  You're so done with arguing with people on Twitter.  I have black people that do nothing but call me racist, which is fine.  I don't care about that at all. 
[00:33:00]  Then I had some marine guy saying how brave I was because I just shoot at paper, paper targets.  And he wouldn't even really comment on any of the issues.  He was just lambasting me for just shooting at paper.  So what should I do?  Go out and just shoot people, then?  What the fuck do you want from me?  Well, he didn't explain that?  No, no.  He's just an idiot.  What are you supposed to shoot at?  I don't care the fact that he's a marine.  That's great.  I respect the uniform.  I don't respect the guy in it, you.  But I think you've said it on the show many times.  You're not a hunter. 
[00:33:30]  Not a hunter.  So what are you supposed to do?  Go out in the woods and start killing things?  That's not your thing.  I think he meant people.  Oh, Jesus.  That guy's face.  You've openly admitted that it's fun.  I enjoy shooting.  You enjoy shooting.  You enjoy the accuracy of being able to shoot.  Did the marine use his real name on Twitter?  Yeah, he had his real picture.  Okay.  I'm good for him.  I respect that.  That's fine.  Not these silly fucking basement dwellers with these dumb fake names. 
[00:34:00]  All that.  Jay Moore pointed out.  And over the years, I've gone, all right, give me your real name.  Yeah.  You know my name.  Let's go.  And of course, every time, nothing.  Never.  I love when people are voting and defending Obama, and it honestly has nothing to do with  the fact of what he did, his record, which is abominable.  Stop it.  Some would say it's not.  Well, yeah, some would.  I mean, honestly.  I'm just a voice of the people screaming at you.  Let's look.  Right now.  Let's look. 
[00:34:30]  I know.  But when these people are calling me a racist, and they're voting for Obama for no other reason  than he's black, just stop.  Just fucking stop.  That's more racist.  There's a lot of people that are not going to vote for him because he's black.  98% of black people voting for Obama.  It doesn't work that way.  It's because he's black.  True.  That's why they're voting for him.  That is true.  I mean, yeah, and if I came out and said I was voting for a candidate just because he  was white, whoa, look out. 
[00:35:00]  That's a problem.  Kennedy.  Kennedy.  Oh, you said a candidate.  Candidate.  Oh, it sounded like Kennedy.  No.  Kennedy?  I wouldn't vote for Kennedy.  Well, it goes back to the Kennedy thing from yesterday.  Yeah.  You know what I learned after the fucking interview?  Because I didn't get to see the documentary ahead of time, and I'm pissed I didn't.  Ethel Kennedy came from a Republican family.  Yeah, the Skagels.  I had no idea.  Skagels.  Like hardcore.  Like they were not happy when she married a Democrat.  She's not even happy to marry him into the Kennedys, though. 
[00:35:30]  No.  I read about it.  Oh, okay.  She's very, very...  I read about it on the paper today.  She doesn't seem like an older lady.  You can see she's extremely with it, and you know, she's probably the same now as she  was 25 years ago.  Yeah.  There was something else in there.  Oh, we were discussing the interview in the bathroom yesterday.  Oh.  And, you know, she said that basically you're not really allowed to be a Republican if you're  a Kennedy.  Yeah.  And it was me and Jimmy.  I'm like, you know damn well there's people in that family that are Republicans. 
[00:36:00]  It would be impossible.  They've got to hide it.  You think they've got to hide it?  They don't want to come out of the closet as a Republican.  But how cool would that be for that person's career to be the first Kennedy that openly  goes, look, man, I can't fuck around anymore.  I'm a Republican.  Imagine a Republican Kennedy.  There were two of them that were going to come out, John and Robert.  Whoops.  You watch what happens in the coming years.  Someone will do that.  Yeah.  It would be a massive story.  But anyway, the boys put this together. 
[00:36:30]  In this country, prosperity has never trickled down from the wealthy few.  Prosperity has always come from the bottom up, from a strong and growing middle class.  It's not about a few people doing well, but it's about giving everybody the chance to do  well.  Just because you have an individual right to bear arms does not mean the state or local  government can't constrain the exercise of that right.  I think the people are blind if they don't see that he's been trying and he's just sincere  about it. 
[00:37:00]  And we can only hope for four more years with Obama, that's for sure.  That's what the American dream's about.  How would you co-sign that, Anthony?  I don't know why you'd endorse this.  That's it.  That's it?  I changed my endorsement for a minute.  I didn't want to argue politics with Robert Kennedy's daughter.  No.  Your fucking father took a bullet in the Ambassador Hotel.  Yeah, but she didn't even know him.  I still respect him. 
[00:37:30]  She's talking about JFK as Uncle Jack.  Uncle Jack.  As she's saying that, I'm like, she's talking about John F. Kennedy.  That face transplant guy is really creepy looking.  He looks better now, though.  He's like, his lip is hanging like one of those fucking grizzly bears.  He's like, oh man, look at what he looked like.  That's fucked up.  Wait, the one on the right is what he looks like now?  Yeah.  That's pretty impressive.  Until you realize he just walked around with his face right now.  Well, it's better than the first shot.  Of course.  Where his fucking... 
[00:38:00]  What happened to him, by the way?  That looks like shotgun to the face.  That looks like shotgun blast to the fucking face.  How the fuck did they figure that out?  Yeah.  The before and after is amazing.  An accident in 97.  And I bet he doesn't have eyes.  I bet those are fake eyes.  Is that...  I don't know, man.  It looks like it could be his eyes.  It looks like the damage was below the eyes.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Holy shit.  Is that a dead guy's face on him?  Dead guy face.  Wow.  Dead guy face.  Wow, that's crazy.  You're looking through someone else's mask. 
[00:38:30]  You just peel it off like that scene in Poltergeist.  Yeah.  He just starts fucking...  Rip his face off.  So, all right.  They put the other face on him.  Wow, they're getting pretty good at that.  You got to take all those anti-rejection drugs or your face will rot off.  Oh, God.  Oh, your own body will eat away the face.  Forever you take him?  Yes.  That's terrible.  He looks like the guy that...  And I love him.  We just lost touch.  That produced our XFL show.  Yeah, I thought he looked familiar.  That's the guy? 
[00:39:00]  Right.  Yeah, that's fucking...  That's an inside thing.  Dead guy face guy.  What kind of accident did that?  Looks like he peed a little bit.  Was it a car wreck?  I don't know.  God damn.  No, it was a gun accident.  It was a gun.  Yeah, I don't know exactly what the details were.  A gun accident.  Wow.  Oh, some fucking...  He went hunting with Chaney.  Remember that guy?  I'll shoot my friend in the face.  Wow.  And the friend still didn't want to trash him.  No.  Oh, my God.  Wait, the friend's name was Harry...  Harry...  Yeah.  ...Witting... 
[00:39:30]  Chepardini.  No, that's Jerry Chepardini.  Harry Whittingdale?  What was it?  Or Whitting...  It was some...  Fuck, I wish I could remember his name.  What did Chaney shoot in the face?  God.  Hey, this guy wants in, man.  He's mad at you.  Greg on the ground.  Greg!  Greg?  Hey, how you doing?  Oh, I'm not mad.  I'm just pointing out little details there.  You say that the Republicans...  I mean, the blacks vote for Obama just because he's black. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Well, you vote for Republicans because they're Republicans.  When's the last Democrat you voted for?  That's different.  I don't believe in the ideology.  Did you vote for Dole?  Did you vote for Palin?  All of those morons.  You know, they're...  You know, they don't have issues where, like,  oh, this guy is definitely, you know, on my side.  Oh, I like the fact that, you know, he's for abort...  He's not for abortions or this and that.  I'm not going to...  You see an R next to his name and you go,  oop, that's my guy. 
[00:40:30]  I'm not...  Because I believe more with their policies.  Not 100%.  I don't believe in 100% of these Republican policies.  But I believe more of their policies than I do the Democrat.  That's why I vote Republican.  Not based on skin color.  Something as fucking stupid as skin color.  Some of these black people that are voting for Obama,  would absolutely have voted for a right-wing, conservative, black candidate  as a Republican just as quickly as they voted for Obama 
[00:41:00]  based nothing on nothing more than the color of his skin.  So if Herman Cain was the Republican...  Candidate?  Again?  Everybody would have voted for him, even though he was a complete moron.  If the Democratic...  There's no way that would have happened.  If the Democratic candidate was white and the Republican candidate was black,  I'm not saying every black person,  but I'm saying a portion of the black community would vote for him because he's black. 
[00:41:30]  It's happening.  Open your fucking eyes.  But even if that was happening, even if that was happening...  I think the guy's saying you're better than that.  What?  He's not saying that.  No, I don't think he is.  I think he is.  Well, I'm just saying that...  Meaning you're a smart guy and maybe you should maybe not vote for your party every single time.  Right.  I think that's sort of the point it's making.  I think you're saying that Clinton was great and everything else,  but I guarantee you didn't vote for Clinton.  You voted for Dole.  Did he vote for Dole? 
[00:42:00]  Dole, I mean, I'm not saying he was a moron or anything like that,  but there was no way that Dole was going to win.  You're missing one point, sir.  The difference between anybody voting for race and voting for party is party is a choice.  Like, if you vote for somebody because there's an R or a D before their name,  you're voting for a choice they've consciously made.  If you're voting for somebody just based on their race,  you're voting for something they had nothing to do with.  But also blacks traditionally vote Democrat.  They do.  So it's hard to prove, I gather. 
[00:42:30]  But the thing is, I've seen a lot of interviews, man on the street things,  where you see black people interviewed about the candidates,  and they have no fucking clue what Obama is even about,  and they're voting for him,  and they're preaching to other people to vote for Obama,  and it's strictly because he's just another black person.  Okay, well, look at it from their point of view, too.  Okay, they weren't allowed to even vote to, like...  Don't fucking start this. 
[00:43:00]  Don't start the basic cop-out excuse every black person uses  and every guilty white person uses to excuse black people.  Stop it.  There's a black guy in the White House.  Game over as far as racism in this country goes.  And fucking years ago, horseshit, I'm sick of it.  I don't know the thing about race.  I'm just saying, look at it from their point of view, okay?  They didn't get to vote, like, the late 50s, early 60s.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Booty hooty hooty ho, we couldn't vote. 
[00:43:30]  Boo.  I'm just saying.  White only fountains.  Boo.  Build your own fountains, then.  See, this is exactly why nothing's getting done in Congress,  because it's like my way or nothing.  Or the highway.  You won't listen to other people's opinion.  I'm not saying anything about race.  I'm not saying anything about all of that, you know,  all that they're bigots or whatever.  I'm just saying that, look at it from their point of view.  They didn't get to vote until the late 50s or early 60s. 
[00:44:00]  And when they had the opportunity to see that there is a black nominee,  they would definitely vote.  It was the same thing as if a woman, you know, like Clinton,  Hillary Clinton was nominated.  Of course more women are going to want to vote for the woman.  So you're saying that the nice superficial thing of just voting for someone  based on skin color should definitely supersede any beliefs you have, 
[00:44:30]  any ideology you have, maybe even what's best for the country,  just for skin color.  How about hat color?  How about shoe color?  That's good.  I like the color of that guy's shoes.  That's my criteria.  But I think he's saying this has always happened,  maybe not to this extent.  I'm tired of black people talking about the fucking past.  If someone voted, finally was able to vote in the late 50s or early 60s,  they're old now. 
[00:45:00]  What about the youth, the fucking youth that continues to be self-destructive  and fucked up and will not even consider voting for a white person?  Just stop it.  Okay, can I say one more little thing?  And I'll use Opie as an example.  Fuck, Opie.  Remember four years ago, Opie, when you said,  geez, you know, I would kind of hope that Obama would win  because I would like to see my first black president while I'm alive.  I said the same thing.  I want to be a black president.  In my lifetime, I would say that. 
[00:45:30]  I probably supported Obama.  I didn't vote for him.  No, that's not saying you did, but you said you would like to see him.  Yeah, a lot of people got confused because I started saying, you know,  Obama a lot if you had to play back the tapes  because I knew in my fucking soul that the guy was going to win.  It was obvious.  And people were like, that's crazy.  We'll never elect a black president.  And then I was like, you know what?  It would be kind of cool to see a black president.  Exactly.  And at the time, I really thought that he was the better candidate.  Right.  And so would probably so many black people. 
[00:46:00]  They said not only is...  I don't necessarily disagree.  Hold on, Greg.  Seeing our first black president, you know, to possibly represent Obama.  But I don't necessarily completely disagree.  Oh, God.  I don't necessarily disagree with Ant, though.  I think a lot of people certainly just voted for Obama because he was black.  I thought at the time he was the better candidate.  Absolutely, I thought that.  Whatever the reasons are.  But going with your point, if Hillary goes and tries for the presidency, 
[00:46:30]  you know a shitload of women are going to blindly vote for her.  Of course.  That's what I'm trying to point out.  Right.  I get it.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Greg, thank you.  I think it's always happened, but, you know, maybe not to this extent.  But then to turn around, and because I bash Obama on what's happened over the past four years,  or lack thereof, and then call me a racist,  I've seen more racism come out of the black community than fucking Klan meetings these days. 
[00:47:00]  It's crazy.  Crazy racism coming out of the black community.  It's disgusting, sickening.  There's no accountability.  No one questions it because they're afraid of getting the scarlet letter R put on their chests.  Enough.  It's freeing to be called racist.  It's freeing.  I want to show how naive I used to be.  I really thought for many, many years, because of how I was brought up in mostly in the white community and stuff,  that only, I'm embarrassed to say this. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, no.  No.  I really thought that only white people could be racist.  I had no idea.  Well, it was drilled into everyone's head.  They said black people can't be racist because in order to be racist, you need a power base.  Right.  You need a power base so you can oppress somebody else so black people can't be racist.  What a cop-out easy excuse that is.  Hey, you're racist.  I can't be.  Shut up.  I was completely uninformed, and it took many, many years, and then I realized, holy fuck,  everyone can be racist.  Yes. 
[00:48:00]  And they are, by the way.  It's also a weird thing of white arrogance, people who don't think blacks are racist,  because it's a weird, it's like saying that white people can think that way, but black  people are much more base and reactive, and it wouldn't occur to them.  There's a really weird arrogance in white people who only accuse other whites of being racist  and won't accuse blacks of being racist.  It's a real fucking subtle form of feeling intellectually superior, almost like, it was 
[00:48:30]  like guys who had, slave owners who had blacks working for them.  It's like, how do you not realize that every person working for you hates your guts and  wants to burn you alive?  Well, not working for you, but like, that's enslaved.  Yeah.  But they would be convinced that these slaves love them.  Oh, yeah.  And maybe in a way they did, but do you know what I'm saying?  It's like the inability to see how much other people are angry with you or how much other  people dislike you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That arrogance.  Ugh.  A lot of Long Islanders pissed off at Greg. 
[00:49:00]  He was making his point.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Rick.  Rick, what's up?  Yeah, I got one name for you.  Hank Johnson.  Yeah.  You know, if you want to vote just plain black, yeah, look at fucking Hank Johnson.  Yeah, Guam's going to fucking tip over.  Yeah, can we play that clip again?  It's one of my favorites.  He had a concern, though, this Hank Johnson.  How did...  He had a legitimate concern.  Yeah.  I mean, how did Mayor, what's his name, in D.C.?  Barry? 
[00:49:30]  Marion Barry.  Marion Barry.  How did Marion Barry get re-elected in D.C.?  With a complete black constituency in D.C.  Everybody knows that there's a lot of black people in D.C.  They voted that fucker back in after all that shit he went through.  Just because he's black.  Just because they wouldn't vote for the white candidate.  The racism there is astounding.  But let's not forget, though, sorry, Jimmy, that Obama wasn't elected because all those 
[00:50:00]  black people voted.  No, it's the guilty white people, too.  In the end, he needed the white vote.  No, the truth of the matter is, he needed the white vote.  And the Republican ticket was a lemon back then.  A fucking piece of shit Republican ticket.  That's on your permanent record.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  I didn't believe in the socialist fucking programs of Barack Hussein Obama.  Sorry.  Sorry.  So, yeah, or Barry. 
[00:50:30]  Used to call him Barry.  Yeah.  Can we...  You got the Hank Johnson clip?  I also have an answer for the question.  Oh, sorry.  No, that's right.  They voted for Marion Barry.  Oh, yeah.  Same reason they voted for Ted Kennedy after a fucking chick went into the water and came  out dead eight hours later.  People are just...  That is true.  People...  Amazing what people will overlook.  Yeah, yeah.  It's amazing what they'll overlook.  Meanwhile, a certain sexual scandal can ruin you.  Yeah.  But fucking smoking crack with a hooker didn't ruin him, and fucking killing a chick didn't  ruin Kennedy.  The thing is, Kennedy couldn't have gone to another state, let's say, that was even white 
[00:51:00]  Irish and get elected, but they're royalty in New England.  The Kennedys are fucking royalty in the whole country, but as far as New England goes, he  wasn't going to lose in Massachusetts.  It just wasn't going to happen.  I think you're hoping that people are better than they are.  In the end, people just vote for the dumbest reasons.  Well, yeah.  They really do.  So, I don't know, I just want to tell the black people, just come on in for the big 
[00:51:30]  win.  Why don't we just fucking, you know, why don't we just put everything in the past away for  a little while?  Just a little while.  Do a little assimilating to society, and see how that works.  If it doesn't, and things don't get better, and police stop stopping you for no reason,  and things, you know, just stop shooting people in Chicago and Detroit and stuff.  See how that works.  If things get better, then we'll go with it. 
[00:52:00]  If not, then just continue to be fucking crazy.  First step?  Yeah.  We need the same language.  Yeah, yeah.  We can't communicate with each other if we're speaking two different languages.  Very fucking crazy.  Different language.  I don't even know sometimes.  Very different language.  It's like trying to listen to Roland.  It's impossible.  We'll give up the word dude.  Dude, if you give up, you know, the N-I-G-G-A.  Let's start there.  I don't think they're giving that up.  Whitey will not say dude, and you can't say, I don't want to give up either word. 
[00:52:30]  I just get scared.  I don't even want to say it.  Oh, boy.  And they've taken dude, by the way.  They've taken dude.  So we can take...  No.  If you want.  Yeah, I want.  It can't be taken.  What do you mean they took dude?  You say my dude.  They can't take dude.  My dude.  You say my dude, but it's my dude.  It's my dude.  They're just rubbing it in our faces.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  We can take your words.  I'll take your words, too, motherfucker.  Now look what we do.  We take your very white words and make them black.  Yeah.  Can we listen to Hank Johnson? 
[00:53:00]  This guy's a terrific American.  He had a concern back in 2010.  He had a place on the island in about 20...  Wait, pause.  And you've got to go back slightly because he's in the middle of it now.  And he's in front of Congress?  What is this?  What's the setup?  And who is he?  I just know his name is Hank Johnson, but how powerful of a guy is he?  I'm Hank Johnson.  He's a congressman.  He's Representative Hank Johnson.  What a dumb motherfucker. 
[00:53:30]  From Georgia.  And they're talking about, I think, sending people to Guam.  Yeah.  Equipment, people, whatever.  He's worried about overpopulation and equipment, the weight of the equipment and everything.  Sure.  It's just a small island is what he's pointing out.  Well, I don't blame him for worry, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But then look what he says.  If I recall, long.  So 24 miles long, about 7 miles wide at the least widest place on the island, 
[00:54:00]  and about 12 miles wide on the widest part of the island.  He's stoned.  And I don't know how many square miles that is.  Do you happen to know?  I don't have that figure with me, sir.  I can certainly supply it to you if you'd like.  Yeah.  My fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize. 
[00:54:30]  We don't anticipate that.  The Guam population, I think.  God bless this guy.  He has to keep it, you know, serious.  Talking about some admiral.  Yeah, an admiral has to deal with this crap.  And the guy behind him is just laughing.  Of course.  Looking down at his paper.  Do you know what the admiral wants to say right now? 
[00:55:00]  Of course.  Oh, boy.  Of course.  I'm afraid it might tip over and capsize.  Capsize the island.  How do you spin this clip?  I don't know.  It's crazy, though.  What are the supporters saying?  Poor Guam.  Imagine if Guam tipped over.  He'd be like, yeah, motherfucker.  I told you.  Does he think islands just float?  Yeah, they just kind of drift along.  People that think islands float are crazy people.  Are there people out there that think islands just float?  Well, what are they, connected to the earth? 
[00:55:30]  Stop.  Oh, my God.  Isn't that hilarious?  What's the possible explanation for the fact that these islands stay put?  But are there really?  Tides.  Tides.  Tides.  Currents.  Waves.  Gravitational falls.  The moon.  How many people think islands float?  I don't know.  That dummy on the view does.  I was going to say, I mean, when Sherry Shepard said the earth could indeed be flat.  She didn't know.  You know, that kind of.  I don't know.  I take care of my kids. 
[00:56:00]  I've seen her at the gym.  The only thing rounder than her is the earth.  Oh, wow.  So.  So she should shut the fuck up, thinking that the earth is flat.  And then her cop-out, you know, she takes care of her kids.  You could either take care of your kids or know the earth is fucking round.  One or the other.  You can't do both.  They're mutually exclusive.  Right.  Jesus.  I don't really understand how, like, the economy works.  Yeah.  The ins and outs. 
[00:56:30]  I know basics.  Sure.  Very complicated.  And maybe if I didn't have kids, maybe I could learn about that a little more.  Sure.  But it's safe to say that you could know that the earth is round and raise kids.  Yeah.  I'm here to say.  Right.  And you know what?  There's just general knowledge.  Right.  You know how long it would take to look up that to see if the earth is actually round?  It would probably take you five seconds.  I don't even think you have to look it up.  I think it's just something common sense would dictate. 
[00:57:00]  And if you're raising kids, I would far prefer that you know that the earth is round.  Oh, man, right?  That would be preferable.  You better not.  Anyway, is there more to the Hank Johnson clip?  You can listen to the response.  Don't anticipate that.  The Guam population, I think, currently about 175,000.  And again, with 8,000 Marines and their families, it's an addition of about 25,000 more into the population.  And also things like the environment, the sensitive areas of the environment, coral reefs and those kinds of things. 
[00:57:30]  And I know that lots of people don't like to think about that,  but we didn't think about global warming either.  Enough of Hank Johnson.  Is this guy a moron?  Because that would be the easiest campaign to win.  Oh, my God. 
[00:58:00]  Your political ad basically says Hank Johnson.  He thinks islands tip over.  Hank Johnson thinks islands are floating in the ocean.  Jesus.  Is this the man you want?  Is he still on the job?  Yeah, he's.  I think he assumed office in 2007.  Who does he represent?  Georgia.  Oh, boy.  Wow, Georgia's dumb.  Fourth District?  Sorry, Georgia.  I know you're listening.  Fourth District?  Yeah.  You people are dumb.  All right.  Yeah.  Is that a bad district?  In Atlanta?  It's the Fourth District.  How do you know the Fourth District?  I've heard about the Fourth District of Georgia. 
[00:58:30]  You've heard?  You've heard?  Yeah.  Got intel?  Have you heard good things?  No.  No?  No.  I've heard.  I've got some websites I go to.  There's your representative.  He thinks islands tip over.  There you go.  If you put too much shit on them.  He won re-election in 2010.  I don't know if it was before or after his statement letter.  Someone's suggesting I might go to Fourth District Mania, the website.  Denver Pest, you prick. 
[00:59:00]  That's funny.  I'm just amazed that Manhattan's still fucking floating.  Right?  With all the buildings on it?  Pretty amazing.  Wow.  Well, they've anchored them with the bridges and tunnels.  That's pretty much what keeps it in place.  Oh.  I didn't realize.  I know.  Well, you've got to do some thinking.  I didn't realize.  Yeah.  This island's got to be the heaviest island.  Top heavy, too, with the tall buildings.  Top heavy.  That's what it is.  Yeah.  And I don't think we've balanced out those tall buildings enough to keep this island  off-floating.  So you might be right with the bridges. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  I get nervous when I see a lot of traffic on the east side and stuff going over the bridges.  Sure.  I'm like, it's going to tip right over.  Depending on the commute, it gets a little squirrely, right?  Yeah.  You can almost feel it.  You can feel like it's shifting a little bit.  Yeah.  Like, whoa.  But then you're like, but no, there's enough people going to Jersey as well.  So it sort of balances it out.  Yeah, you just know it balances out.  That's why we're not tipping over.  I think there are buoys lining the island.  When you talk, there are.  I know there's some kind of dumb hearing down there, but if a guy is concerned that an 
[01:00:00]  island might tip over, you should be allowed to say whatever the fuck you want to that guy.  Right.  Just turn around and say, are you a fucking idiot?  Right.  That was a military guy, though.  Oh, yeah.  That was a military guy.  Yes, yes.  Who just knew he was dealing with a dummy.  By the book.  But he probably has been dealing with these idiots for so many years.  He doesn't even face them anymore.  True.  What dopes he has to talk to?  All right.  We're going to break.  Yeah, something to eat.  Something.  In the way she moved.  Yeah, let's play that. 
[01:00:30]  There's a radio phone call that's picking up steam.  Yeah?  Yeah, I tweeted about a week ago, and then the morning mashup tweeted yesterday.  Ooh.  And this thing is absolutely going viral.  Mashup.  So maybe we should bring it to our show.  The deer crossing fucking lady.  Oh, right.  Is that real?  I tweeted it as real.  I think it's real?  We should play it and then decide.  Have you heard the whole thing yet?  We'll play.  You decide.  I heard it.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:01:00]  I was a little suspect.  You are?  Yeah.  After I tweeted and said it was real, I'm a little suspect, too.  I'm a little suspect.  Because it just seems way.  Oh, it's on Gawker now and everything.  Fuck, this thing blew up.  All right, we'll play the deer crossing phone call next and get into some other things.  Sirius XM.  XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We've got lots going on today. 
[01:01:30]  Thanks for checking us out today.  What is this?  Ramones.  Ramones.  It's rock and roll radio, I think.  Rock and roll radio.  Great tune.  Radio.  Yeah, it's rock and roll radio.  Radio.  I should have been into these guys, but...  Me, too.  Never really was.  Don't mind them.  Just never really searched them out. 
[01:02:00]  I got into them very recently, like within the last two years.  I'd rather listen to Green Day.  That's real punk.  Yeah, it is.  Yeah.  When you think punk, you've got to put fucking Green Day at the top of the list.  Top of the list, my friend.  Even Johnny Rotten agreed with that, right?  Yeah.  Who doesn't?  So we got this dummy, calls a radio station in, where, Sam?  North Dakota, is it?  Yeah, Fargo.  Fargo.  Oh.  The Y-94 Playhouse in Fargo. 
[01:02:30]  This is a great...  Oh, jeez.  This is a great phone call because, A, if it's real, she's one of the stupidest people alive.  I say one of because we know about Sherry Shepard and Hank Johnson at this point.  Or, these guys are really good at fucking pulling pranks.  Well, it's...  I have to listen again.  I'm not sure.  All right.  I listened once.  I didn't know.  I was thinking it was fake.  You were thinking it was fake, huh?  Yeah. 
[01:03:00]  Because, like, I'm pretty good at finding fake videos.  That one that was in front of the Apple store, that girl that was being interviewed by that  guy.  Oh, Rachel.  And she was talking about the Apple phone or something.  The Apple 5.  That was so fake and set up.  Yeah, corny.  Obviously an actress.  Right.  But I'll tell you this.  This viral video, half as many hits.  Oh, shit.  It's just hitting.  Just hitting.  It was on Gawker a week ago.  Oh, no.  Oh.  You sure?  Yeah, it was post-October 12th.  Now he's obsessed. 
[01:03:30]  Look at him.  I love the fact that he's already fucking peaked.  Yeah.  He's already done his Citizen Kane and he's not even 30 yet.  Oh, that's it.  You're done.  I hope that wasn't my piece.  That was it.  That's it, buddy.  Not going to get another one.  No.  All right.  So here it is.  She calls this radio station.  Missing is all that's going on there.  Now, Donna, you got quite the vent today.  It sounds like what's going on with you.  Well, I wanted to voice my opinion on something that's been bothering me for a really long time.  Okay. 
[01:04:00]  I tried writing the newspaper and contacting TV stations, but nobody seems to want to play with this.  So that's why I'm calling you guys.  What's the issue?  Over the past few years, I've been involved in three separate car accidents involving gear.  Who was this?  It's fake.  So let's move on.  Why?  What happened?  She gulped.  That's such a tell.  The gulp?  Yeah, she didn't have confidence in what she was about to say. 
[01:04:30]  Well, sometimes nerves.  That's such a tell.  Sometimes nerves when you call a radio show.  Yeah, she might be nervous being on the radio.  Go back.  You could hear the gulp.  That gulpy thing.  If you study people, that's one you look out for.  The gulp is a fucking tell.  Hit it.  I'm calling you guys.  What's the issue?  Well, over the past few years, I've been involved in three separate car accidents involving deer.  You know, the population and everything.  Each of these incidents, they've occurred shortly after I saw a deer crossing sign on the highway. 
[01:05:00]  Well, my frustration is that Minnesota and North Dakota Department of Transportation would allow these deer crossings to be in such high traffic areas.  I mean, I haven't even seen them on the interstate.  Why are we encouraging deer to cross at the interstate?  I don't get it.  That's such a high traffic area.  I mean...  What do you think, Jimmy? 
[01:05:30]  I mean, she sounds like a caller.  She sounds like an absolute dummy.  Yeah, she doesn't sound like an actress, but she's doing a good job if this is fake.  But she's pretty articulate.  I think it's fake because that's like a comedy joke from Evening at the Improv.  Right, yeah, yeah.  She's a little too articulate to be saying something is dumb.  Why do they put the deer crossings?  Right, right.  Why do they put the deer crossings?  Why a deer crossing the street?  This guy says it's absolutely real. 
[01:06:00]  We have more than a call, but let's go to Matt.  He knows the person that...  Right, it happened to.  Matt.  I didn't say I knew the person.  Oh, liar.  But I am out of Fargo, North Dakota, and I heard it the day it was on.  It blew my fucking mind.  It doesn't mean it's not fake.  Yeah, that's what they wanted to happen.  They definitely ended.  When we used to do our fucking pranks and shit, we wanted people to believe.  Yeah.  That's how that works.  You do have a good point.  These guys should totally be on your jacks over because they do the fucking War of Roses 
[01:06:30]  and everything.  They do?  They do War of the Roses?  Oh, yeah.  I got to change my opinion.  This is fake.  Fake.  Fake.  Totally.  But I think she really did a great job pulling it off.  Yeah.  She sounds authentic, like a real dumb caller.  Thank you, Matt.  Yeah.  As does Matt.  Let me, uh, let's play a little more of this.  You know, I understand that deer are wild animals and they need to travel across the streets  occasionally to survive and, of course, to find food, but it seems to me that it's so 
[01:07:00]  irresponsible of us to allow these deer crossings to be in areas where these deer are so likely  to be struck by oncoming traffic.  I mean, wouldn't you agree?  Um, I mean, it's, it's just, I mean, you think they would put deer crossings?  I'm sorry for all the pausing, but I'm just trying to break this down.  If you're a radio guy and you got a phone call like this, you're not going to just sit  there in silence anymore. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're going to be like, are you, are you serious?  That don't make no sense.  That don't make no sense.  Right.  You're going to do that.  Just ripping off SNL.  Oh, God.  I don't know why you want to rip off SNL like that.  Come up with your own shit.  Jesus.  All the fucking shows to rip off.  You pick a lame show like SNL, but why, why aren't they challenging her?  Yeah.  And you would hammer it home.  Like, what are you?  Yeah.  You're serious.  Yeah.  I'd be like, so what you're saying here is that they put the signs up and that's where  the deer cross.  Right.  Don't you understand that it's the other way around? 
[01:08:00]  If you're both in on it, then you, you would just kind of like, kind of giggle like,  Oh, this is crazy.  Yeah.  And let her keep talking like that?  I don't know.  I don't, I don't think so.  You know, in, you know, smaller towns, maybe during a, like at a, at a school crossing,  that's what, it would be a safer place for them to cross.  You know, put the deer crossing sign.  You know, deer crossings aren't telling deer that it's safe to cross there.  It's just more of like an alert for drivers.  So they know it's like a high deer population. 
[01:08:30]  The government put the deer crossings there.  They can direct the deer population anywhere they want to by moving that deer crossing  sign.  I mean, that's silly.  You know, why in the world would they place it on the highway or the interstate?  You know, I mean, God, there are so many other places I can think of than put the deer  crossing signs on busy highways or interstate.  You seem to be under the misunderstanding that the deer are somehow attracted to the deer  crossing sign.  Well, well, yeah, the deer crossing sign is there to allow the deer, you know, that's 
[01:09:00]  what they need to cross.  From this, yeah.  Right.  I mean, like, yeah.  And all these car accidents you had involved a deer after you'd saw a deer crossing sign.  Exactly.  I mean, I, I mean, I'm trying to watch out for the deer, but I mean, you know, speed limit  is 55, 65.  How am I supposed to, you know, you can't brake really quick if you, you know, the deer is crossing  in that deer crossing area. 
[01:09:30]  So you'd like to see these signs move somewhere safer?  Right.  If we have, we can move them.  Like, don't put deer crossing signs on the interstate or, or freeways, you know, put them  in, uh, lower traffic areas.  You know, somewhere where the speed limit, you know, a lot slower, you know, maybe small  towns.  I don't know.  I think school crossings is a good idea.  Well, listen, we will, um, yeah, I mean, you say you've tried to contact quite a few  people about this.  Totally fine.  Right.  Yeah.  I wrote like at least three or four letters and. 
[01:10:00]  We will spread the word.  Okay.  We will try to kind of help you raise some awareness for this issue.  Okay.  Oh, thank you.  We need to move those deer crossing signs.  We appreciate your comment this morning.  All right.  Thanks.  Bye.  Two, three, seven hits.  You can text four, nine, three, three.  I'll be honest.  I mean, they got me.  I mean, the first time I heard it, I thought it was real and I even posted it as such. 
[01:10:30]  But it's not.  Why?  It's not real.  No, it's not.  It's just not real.  Joe saying it is real though.  And he could explain why Joe.  Hey boys.  First off, love the show.  Awesome show.  Keeps me awake in the morning.  Of course it is.  Yes, we know it's great.  You know what?  Good.  All right.  But I actually am good friends with one of the DJs on that station.  Just for the heck of a, I had to text him this morning for that morning show.  Man, that stuff is real. 
[01:11:00]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Nick in Arkansas.  Nick.  Yeah.  How are you doing today, boys?  All right, Nick.  That was going around about six, eight months ago as an article, a little snippet of a photo  that you could see on Facebook or on Twitter where a lady had written this, you know, op-ed  saying, oh, you got to move the deer crossing signs because, you know, they're in high traffic  areas.  I posted it myself.  So I think it sounds fake.  Plus, those DJs sounded like they were leading there a bit. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, a little bit.  You know what?  But I give them a lot of credit today because I got tricked at first.  I got a little lazy.  But they pull it off very well.  They should get all the heat they're getting.  She sounded like a dumb caller.  Yeah.  They pulled it off very well.  Very well.  So good for them.  Do you want to hear her follow-up interview?  Yeah, sure.  They got her back on the phone.  Oh, really?  Like recently.  All right.  Hold on a second.  We got a guy.  Well, that's because it went very well.  They want to kind of keep it going. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, that's where they should just shut their fucking mouths and let it fucking live.  When are you going to go back to the Apple Store and interview that girl again?  I actually want to follow up.  One of the people who work at the Apple Store?  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  Hello?  Oh.  Yes.  Who's this?  Yeah, you're on the radio.  Hey, how come they have those children at play signs?  What are they trying to do?  Get like the kids to go play in the street or something? 
[01:12:30]  What?  The children at play.  They're sitting in the street playing jacks or something.  And they're driving and killing them.  Well, that seems to be a problem.  That doesn't even.  But that doesn't make sense.  Yes, it does.  They're playing in the street and getting all over my cars.  Who fucking send this one out, bitches?  Viral video.  We should make this a video and put it up on YouTube.  We should move the children at play signs is what he's saying. 
[01:13:00]  It's kind of stupid to encourage that activity.  That they're playing on the street.  Yeah.  Oh, I got it.  Yeah, yeah.  Jim, you just missed a very...  Jim, talk to this guy on the phone here.  He's crazy.  Yeah.  Hello?  Oh.  I must have hung up.  Ah, shit.  I missed it.  Why would he hang up?  I don't know.  He thought the children at play signs like they were putting the signs there so the children  could play there in the street.  It's crazy.  Ah, that's funny.  Yeah.  I'm kind of mad that I got duped.  Oh, man.  I'm usually pretty good at this shit. 
[01:13:30]  You're just a sweet, gullible boy.  The Opster got duped.  Opie didn't get duped.  The Opster did, though.  Fuck.  I got duped.  Did you think it was fake the whole time, Ant?  Would it...  Yeah, yeah.  Ah, God.  I'm getting lazy.  Years ago, would Opie have gotten duped like that?  Let's face it.  The Opster's slipping.  So, this is the follow-up?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  This is where they blow it, I betcha.  I betcha.  So, now the radio station calls her back or something?  I guess.  This is much more recently.  Or did she call that?  We'll find out. 
[01:14:00]  Okay.  Because we don't take down the phone numbers of the people that call our show.  Of course not.  I hit it.  Y94.  Y94 is the Valley's number one hit music station and home of the Playhouse in the morning.  We are Zero Rant and Mangy.  Good morning.  I don't know what this emotion is, but I think it might be giddy.  I'm feeling outright giddy.  I'm so excited.  You're just giggly and smiley, and yeah, you're giddy.  Donna the dear lady returns in just a moment, but again, just a quick recap.  She calls about a month ago. 
[01:14:30]  Pause.  What are they doing?  They're going to blow it.  Yep.  Yep.  Because now everyone is writing me saying, I mean, my Twitter just explored.  They're saying this has been a hack Facebook joke for years.  Yes.  Not months.  Years.  Years.  Years.  I only recently got on the old Facebook.  Been seeing it for years.  Just to do a fan page, really.  Because I don't really, I think Facebook is really kind of silly.  Yeah.  But I don't know.  A fan page is kind of fun.  But anyway, so why would they, why would they, let this bitch just breathe on its own? 
[01:15:00]  You got away with it.  They don't have another one in them.  They need to keep the heat.  Let it rip.  Here we go.  Crossing signs.  Doesn't make any sense why we would ask deer to cross here on the highway.  How foolish is this?  Everybody erupts on our phones going, does she realize, does she not realize what she's saying?  Does she have any idea of what she's saying?  No, we just thought this was done.  Wasn't, honestly, wasn't the weirdest thing on the show that we've ever had.  It wasn't.  We've had weirder.  Weirder people have called us.  But we put it in the podcast, think nothing of it, move on with our lives. 
[01:15:30]  Then, weeks go by, a couple of people, they find that podcast, get it forwarded around  in their email, what have you, and it ends up on YouTube.  That video has how many views?  1,611,900.  And the eruption of press when something goes viral on the internet is insane, featured on  television and newspapers and other radio shows across the country.  What I did is I just made a quick little montage for you of some of the people that have 
[01:16:00]  talked about Donna the Deer Lady from the Playhouse family to around the world.  Good for them.  Yeah, I was just saying this morning.  They're repurposing.  I didn't want to make the part of Christ.  The Deer Crossing Lady over the weekend.  It went viral in a big, big way.  There's a radio station in Fargo, North Dakota.  Y94.  It's like a number one hit music station, Y94.  This is a show from...  Got the calls in there.  I think it's like South Dakota.  Yeah, it is.  Somewhere in South Dakota.  Listen to this. 
[01:16:30]  So, they're doing a topic and this woman calls in.  Now, Donna, you got quite the vent today.  It sounds like what's going on with you.  Thanks.  Station just up the road from us in Fargo, Y94.  So, am I correct in that she thinks that the deer are only crossing because there's signs?  Yes.  She has an issue with the deer crossing signs in the Fargo-Moorhead area.  How can you be that dumb and have a driver's license?  So, she thinks they're building these deer crossing things because that's where the deer cross.  Not knowing that there's just a high population in these areas and that's just where the deer run across, naturally. 
[01:17:00]  You know all of them deer crossing signs.  We got, you know, we got to move them.  Okay, do you understand why she's stupid?  Oh, my gosh, what an idiot.  Okay, continue.  What an idiot.  I mean, I haven't even seen them on the interstate.  Yeah, stupid people.  And there's a morning show trending and these guys are getting a lot of attention today in Fargo, North Dakota, because of a phone call.  Boy, I'm done with this.  Yeah.  And look, there's that viral video.  The German guy jumping on the frozen pool is now the big thing on Fox News. 
[01:17:30]  That is so fucking funny.  That has to be.  Is that fake or real?  No, that's not fake.  No, that's absolutely real.  It looks like he broke his back.  This guy.  Get that on the Facebook page, E-Rock, please.  I watched that.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  I watched that a few times yesterday.  The more I watched it, the funnier it got.  The way he is before it, motherfucker, I'm going to jump.  And he jumps and his friends laughing make it even funnier.  Yeah.  They should have went with the slow-mo.  I know the slow-mo is overdone on YouTube, and I certainly am guilty of that at times. 
[01:18:00]  But in this case, you definitely should have went with the slow-mo.  He fucking smashed his tailbone on that ice.  It looks like you should have went right through the ice, but no.  I think that's what he thought was going to happen.  And no.  We'll put it on the Facebook page, Opie and Anthony.  But back to the deer crossing.  I was duped as well, but it's so obvious now that it is fake.  And now someone's saying it's an old George Carlin joke.  What? 
[01:18:30]  Really?  Do you know, Jimmy?  I have not heard that.  No, I would have recognized that.  I know my George Carlin.  I don't remember if someone could point us in the right direction for the George Carlin line.  Yeah, I have not heard that.  It's a search engine.  It's a search engine.  George Carlin, deer crossing.  Do you want to continue with this?  Because they interviewed the deer crossing lady, or are we done?  Do you want to hear the blowers?  I'm sure they'll blow it.  I want to hear her interviewed.  Sure.  All right.  They're showing.  The morning playhouse radio show on Y94 in Fargo, North Dakota. 
[01:19:00]  Y94 in Fargo, North Dakota.  She's thinking that they're actually herding the deer.  Yes, I...  You know what I'm saying?  Sure.  So maybe she legitimately thinks, maybe in the woods somewhere, there are fences.  Right.  Sort of like a line at Six Flags.  Right.  What a dummy, huh?  Yeah.  Wow.  Does she really believe those signs are there for the deer to know it's okay to cross?  And...  I had no idea that deer are smart enough to be like, oh, okay, well, where's the sign? 
[01:19:30]  Oh, there it is.  Legitimately brain-dead dumb.  And the morning show host on the Y94 Morning Playhouse did his best to be polite.  Much more polite than I would have been.  Yeah, let's tell the deer that they can't cross here.  It's not safe.  Ladies and gentlemen of the Playhouse family, now after having received well over one million  views on YouTube, may we welcome back to the show, Fargo's own, Donovan Dealey! 
[01:20:00]  Oh, by the way, pause again.  I'm sorry, but I'm getting some intel.  Well, look, man, the W94 in Fargo's Facebook page is getting jock-tobered.  We didn't tell them to go there.  Well, if they want to have this kind of exposure, they're going to deal with it.  They're going to have to deal with all...  You know, we had a lot of fun and a lot of good times, but of course, the one show and their 
[01:20:30]  fans had to be negative about this.  Absolutely.  Wait a minute.  What?  What happened?  Okay, okay, okay.  I thought they went to phase two already.  Oh, okay, there they are.  All right.  Yeah, I mean, are people being supportive?  Yeah, I think so.  Oh, okay.  Craig Hughes hates me.  Anthony was...  Wait, you know what that is?  That's my old buddy, Jim Chandler. 
[01:21:00]  That's the guy you made fun of last year.  I started right now.  It's all Jim Chandler pictures.  Look, I knew him when he was Jim Crow.  That caption says, I wish I was...  Anthony wishes he did.  Yeah, right?  Jim Crow.  That was his name, man.  When I knew him, we started in radio together.  I got to say it again.  We even roomed together.  We even stayed one summer behind in Geneseo to run the college radio station.  We had dreams. 
[01:21:30]  Fast forward a bunch of years, and I attack him on Jocktober.  I didn't know it was him.  Oh, man.  And I've tried to make good, and he doesn't want anything to do with me.  He fucking hates me.  Chip hanging out with Kenan.  Yeah, Kenan and Kellen Chip, that don't make no sense.  And then me with Terry Schiavo as members of KISS.  I love that one.  Is that you, Sam?  Yeah, me as a black man.  Yeah, and a hoodie.  And, of course, Greg will be who's HB.  Come on, Jim.  Oh.  Come on.  Let's work this out. 
[01:22:00]  We go way back.  Oh, man.  All right.  Can we get the interview of the...  Yeah, where's this lady now?  Oh, boy.  They're going to blow it right now.  Hi.  I'm very well.  How are you guys?  We're good.  But, girl, you famous.  Oh.  Oh, my goodness.  I didn't say that.  I can't believe all this hubbub.  Holy cow.  Well, first of all, can I just say thank you to you three wonderful human beings for being  so nice to me the last time I was on the radio with you? 
[01:22:30]  Thank you.  How are things now?  Just let us know how your life is, because I don't know if you realize you're well into  over a million...  It's the same as exactly as it was before.  Right.  Because no one knows who this bitch is.  Exactly.  Or cares.  Completely fake, and I'll tell you how this came about.  Oh.  The stupid fucking PD.  Their version of the radio wizard said, oh, my God, this is getting so much fucking attention.  And they probably had a meeting.  How can we keep this going? 
[01:23:00]  How can we keep it going?  Instead of just letting it be.  Right.  Yeah.  Radio shows all the time blow it by doing this.  So then they're like, all right, well, she obviously works in sales.  Let's do a follow-up fucking phone call, man.  Yeah.  And then maybe the media will pick up on that as well.  And you'll get a second wave.  It's going to be fantastic.  Of exposure and press.  And press.  You think it was a dumb PD?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Dave Douglas type.  We've been in these dumb meetings.  How do we capitalize on this?  Yeah.  There may or may not have been people down the hall that have highly suggested that I try 
[01:23:30]  to find...  Of course they did.  ...iPhone girl to do a follow-up.  Oh, they did, right?  Of course.  That's what they do.  They're just stupid.  Imagine that.  They're always trying to capitalize on things.  And it wouldn't be as good.  Right.  You're enjoying your iPhone or...  Yeah.  Sometimes things happen and you just let it be.  Yeah.  Beatles said it best.  I hit that day.  Boop.  I know.  Oh, my gosh.  I mean, gee whiz.  From that one phone call.  I mean, you guys must have had to totally tie your giggle bones down with that last call. 
[01:24:00]  So, my life, wow, it's been interesting.  Almost kind of like a carny ride in an odd way.  To clarify, you are now aware deer crossing signs, their purpose is to alert drivers of  deer, yes?  Yes.  Yeah.  Now that I've had the reasoning for deer crossing signs...  What's your name?  What does your family think?  Right.  Right. 
[01:24:30]  What's her name?  They know her name, so why would they bother with that?  But you can't say what's your name because then...  She's down the hall in sales.  Right.  Because then the press will go and look her up.  Yeah.  And how has anybody noticed who she is?  Right.  Right.  Not you, the lady.  And then, because obviously they're getting calls from the local TV.  Hey, we want to interview this person.  We'll give you all the credit in the world.  And they'll like, we'll get back to you.  What's her name?  Donna.  What does her family think?  Where does she work?  What do your co-workers think of this newfound fame? 
[01:25:00]  Queen Elizabeth says on Twitter, thank you for being nice to me when I was on the air last  time, said no O&A listener ever.  Well, we tend to do things a little differently around here.  Trees on people's houses on the Y94 Facebook page.  Oh, there's a tree on there.  There's a tree on my road.  There's Terry Clifford holding up a copy of Mind Pump.  Poor Terry Clifford. 
[01:25:30]  Go back to it.  I'm sure these guys will answer all the questions I had, like what's her name and what's not.  Um, I just have to say that I, I feel incredibly stupid.  I mean, I mean, honestly, I mean, just on my defense, I had no clue that these signs are  for us.  I mean, because I never really thought about it enough to realize that I was kind of being  ridiculous.  So, um, you know, and in my defense, you know, I grew up in a, in a really small North Dakota  town, you know, and I'm a passionate Irish woman and I have an extreme love for animals. 
[01:26:00]  But you know, where I lived, um, and grew up now, I was pretty isolated.  So until my husband's husband brought me to Fargo about three years ago or so.  You know what this might be?  People might have been saying it was fake.  So maybe they're trying to make it look real by her just going, eh, I didn't know.  Maybe they're trying to cut off all the things people saying it was ripped off or it was  fake.  I'm just mad that I fucking bought it for a little while there.  I'm kind of mad at myself.  The opester wants to believe. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  The opester does want to believe.  He really does.  I hate the opester character.  Ah, the opester really sees the good side of people's nature.  The opester's good natured.  You know?  Well, and obviously when we were talking to you, we were trying to be nice.  We tried to kind of explain things.  But once we got off the phone with you and people started calling in, what kind of happened  when you heard that? 
[01:27:00]  Oh, my gosh.  I mean, honestly, literally, when I got off the phone with you guys, my coworkers and my  family, they were texting me after this.  And, you know, I heard about all your phone calls.  Holy cow.  You guys must have been, like, inundated.  People making fun of me.  And then my phone wouldn't stop ringing for, like, almost two days.  It was crazy.  I couldn't believe it.  So, have you been getting constant attention since you've been on our show? 
[01:27:30]  Actually, you know, after a while, it died down for a couple weeks after I was talking  to you guys on the radio.  But then, just a few days ago, I started getting email about the YouTube links from people with  the podcast.  How would you know it's her?  How does anyone know it's her?  Stop it.  Oh, I started getting emails.  How do they know your email address?  How do they know it's you?  You hear how vague this is?  We don't know anything.  It's so vague.  Any personal information about her.  It's like an EROC text. 
[01:28:00]  Hey.  What?  You around?  Obviously.  See the news?  See the news.  What news?  Oh, boy.  Can I talk to you for a second?  He ain't even cracking a smile.  Why not?  I hear there's a lot of tension back there.  There is.  Yeah, we're getting some.  Oh, shit.  I want to straighten this out.  Yeah, he's having a rough.  Eric's having a rough go of it.  Oh, well.  Let's get you in this league.  Do tell.  It had to be nice, too, to know that it was just getting spread all over the world, huh? 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  In one respect, yeah.  Kind of.  Kind of.  Kind of.  You know, part of me now has decided to stand up and just own this like a modern woman,  you know?  And, you know, I have people coming up to me and saying, oh, my God, are you Donna the  dear lady?  And, you know, are you that lady from Y94?  And, you know, after a while.  On the street, people are coming up to her and saying, Donna the dear lady?  No, they're not.  No one said that. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, because they don't know what you look like.  How could they?  Well, she had a shirt on that said, dumb cunt.  Right.  Yes.  That's me.  I'm Donna the dear lady.  So, I'm just, you know, laughing it off and rolling with it.  Plain and simple.  But, you know what?  What's that?  The one thing that's been kind of rough is some neighborhood children have been, you  know, keeping.  I had to have a hysterectomy.  And the last thing I heard is they put me under and removed my womanly plumbing.  That's how stupid I was. 
[01:29:30]  So, now I've been battling with my worth as a human being because internally I'm just  a warehouse.  Oh, my God.  She, by the way, I see something coming here that's really going to be bullshit.  Oh, no.  Like, I just got, I caught enough at the beginning of this where this is just bad.  What do you think?  Let's see.  Can you go back?  Something about the neighborhood kids.  The neighborhood kids who absolutely wouldn't know who the fuck she is. 
[01:30:00]  I'm just like a modern woman, you know.  And, you know, I have people coming up to me and saying, oh, my God, are you Donna the  dear lady?  And, you know, are you that lady from Y94?  And, you know, after a while I was at the point of saying, yes, that's me.  I'm Donna the dear lady.  So, I'm just, you know, laughing it off and rolling with it.  Plain and simple.  But, you know what?  What's that?  The one thing that's been kind of rough is some neighborhood children have been, you know, 
[01:30:30]  keeping printouts of deer crossing signs and shoving them in my mailbox.  I mean, this has been going on for, like, the past week or so.  That's kind of frustrating.  But, you know, kids will be kids.  You know, I'm kind of letting things roll off my shoulders.  Tittering.  And then my coworkers have been relentless.  No.  Relent.  No.  Every John I pick up on the street says, yo, bitch, are you Donna the dear lady?  As he fills my backside with unprotected seats. 
[01:31:00]  Jesus.  Jimmy.  You're dark.  People have just been coming up to me and saying things.  You know, I was at this wedding and I was laying on my back in the yard and some guy put  his metal leg in my vagina.  And so this is what I think of Donna the dear lady.  My fat Asian wife, Susan, hates deer.  They used to step all over her family's hut. 
[01:31:30]  She got Lyme disease.  My fat wife, Susan, got Lyme disease from her dear lady.  Holy shit, that's so fucking funny.  Yeah, these are titanium, like on the deer signs on the highway.  That no neighborhood children would know, would go through the trouble of print.  No, no one would care like this.  It's, it's bullshit.  It would be better if she's putting deer shit in her mailbox. 
[01:32:00]  Or in her box.  You know, a lot of the neighborhood children have been holding me down and filling my vagina  with deer feces.  They, they pack it, they put on gloves and they pack it in with the heel of their boots.  Like turkey stuffing.  Yeah.  They've been filling my, my fucking vagina.  I'm very sick now.  I'm in the hospital.  I have, my vagina's very sick from deer feces.  He's being fucking punched into it. 
[01:32:30]  My husband won't even kiss me.  I hate this one.  Of course.  They've been deleting comments off their Facebook wall.  Oh no.  But they're leaving up the two pictures of what's this, of Jim, uh, Chandler.  Of Jim Chandler.  Those aren't getting deleted.  But they don't want to delete their Facebook because now there's so much heat around it,  they want to leave it up.  Oh yeah, yeah.  They don't need a bunch of fucking tomfoolery ruining it.  Winning their big moments.  It's a big day for them not to pull their Facebook down. 
[01:33:00]  Because a bunch of assholes put dick in pussy pictures and rape jokes.  Fucking women getting their face shot upon.  Some fucking fat kid holding his man tits.  Like, what is this?  Not going to ruin our day.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  More from Donna the Dear Lady.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, patients have been teasing me.  Um, you know, cause I, I work as a receptionist at, at a clinic here in Fargo. 
[01:33:30]  So, you know, I thought things were dying down a little bit.  At least you're not a doctor.  A little bit.  Until we woke up this morning and found like a plastic life-sized deer in our lawn.  Next to one of those highway signs.  No, no, no, no.  None of this happened.  That you, they're trying to get an angle on the story.  Dear Lady.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  God.  Apparently, yeah, yeah.  It's like, let's make it like a bunch of people are reacting.  And that way the news will do another story about how people are, like, doing things to  her as far as the story goes.  Yeah, that's great. 
[01:34:00]  That'll, that'll get the news back.  Yeah.  Oh God, this is so fucking, ew, douchey.  Yeah, so what happened?  Oh, all the neighborhood kids have been giving me trouble about this deer business.  I was with my boyfriend and they burned a cross on our lawn.  He's a darker gentleman.  It's all this deer business.  This deer business is going too far.  They're trying hard to delete comments.  Are they?  They really don't want to shut stuff down. 
[01:34:30]  I don't blame them.  So the, uh, so the deer.  It's a man blowing two people.  Blowing two men.  Oh, it's a photo called Lucky Devil.  Oh my goodness.  Yeah, that is just, uh, come on.  The neighborhood kid.  This is the biggest sensation.  Yeah.  Oh boy.  It's crazy.  I had a little doubt.  Oh God.  No.  I had a little doubt, but there's no doubt anymore.  Stupid PD got involved.  Let's get that second wave of publicity. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  And I bet they're calling the news.  You hear what happened?  She was on again.  And people are like, all right, we're over.  People are, uh, people are reacting to this.  Uh, they're, uh, they're putting a deer on her lawn.  Yeah.  Wouldn't it be great if she was found, like, decapitated with a severed deer leg shoved into  her hiney?  Mexicans got her.  She's a victim of cartel violence.  There's tons of gay porno being put on this.  Now, let's just put gay.  Hardcore gay pornography is, uh, on the page. 
[01:35:30]  Wow.  I'm on a radio station with a weird audience.  Yeah.  I don't get these guys.  That's what happened to get all this attention.  They're weird things.  They're strange.  You gotta take the bad with the good.  Let's get to the end of this dumb call.  Yeah.  Criminy Christ, people.  I get it now.  Well, listen, Donna, I mean, the first call was very fun for us.  Uh, you seem to be taking it in good spirits, and we certainly appreciate you calling in.  And, you know, I'm sorry that this has, to some extent, maybe negatively affected your  life.  But we will do our best to maybe help it calm down here.  It will blow over, I promise. 
[01:36:00]  You know, thank you so much.  That's so sweet.  It's just that, you know, I'm a concerned woman, you know, when it comes to certain subject  matters.  And honestly, you know, I absolutely learned a good lesson out of the whole experience  if anything else.  But, you know, I would kind of ask, if I can ask people to stop sharing the length of our  herself conversation, you know, that, you know, that would be kind of nice.  You know, I really want the recording of my first call to kind of go away soon. 
[01:36:30]  I mean, over a million people have seen it.  How many people are left?  Yeah, I guess.  That's a plea to pass the link around the world.  Well, Donna, I really do appreciate that you can kind of take the title Donna the Dear  Lady and own that.  I think we, if nothing else, we owe you a t-shirt.  Donna the Dear Lady t-shirt.  We will make it and design it ourselves.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, that's so sweet of you guys.  You're so sweet.  That's very nice of you.  Thanks for being so nice to me.  You're famous.  You're in and out.  Did you hear the t-shirt? 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  That was an idea by somebody in marketing.  Oh, no.  Let's get the 94.  What are they?  Y-94.  Y-94.  Donna the Dear Lady.  T-shirt's out there.  Morning.  What is their morning show called, though?  The breakfast club.  No, it's the Playhouse.  The Playhouse.  We need our Y-97.  Our Y-94 number one hit music.  Donna the Dear Lady t-shirts.  Donna the Dear Lady.  Morning Playhouse.  Just all the stupid shit all over it. 
[01:37:30]  They're trying to start a sensation, and it's already going to go away.  It's daunting.  Look, good for them.  Getting a lot of exposure.  But it's completely fake.  Yeah.  So obvious now.  And that call right there.  So if anyone else plays this as real, they're stupid.  Yeah.  I guess the morning mashup played it as real.  Oh.  What was that?  There's a deer on my house.  There's a deer on my house.  This is my fat wife Susan. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  There's a man urinating on a man who has duty on him.  Well, you've got to get the duty off.  A bag of dicks.  A bag of dicks.  The old, the very old lady fucking.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  What type of show is this?  Why is Black Earl nude on their page?  The nude Earl picture.  Is that his head on a body?  No.  No.  So Earl's pretty white, huh?  Earl's face is blacker than his body.  That's really strange.  It's very white.  He's blotchy. 
[01:38:30]  That's crazy.  They're trying, though.  They're deleting.  That wasn't even a jock-tober.  The fans are very tasteless.  No, we've still got jock-tober.  It's crazy.  Dude, it's very tasteless to be doing all this.  One guy is complaining, there's a house on my deer.  We're going to break here.  You know what?  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  Good for them getting the exposure, but they...  They're blowing it now.  They're kind of blowing it.  They should just shut their mouths.  I want to get to the bottom of certain things around here, too. 
[01:39:00]  Oh.  Oh, you want to get out?  I got some intel from Blue Heeler in Kentucky.  Somebody may have said unpleasant things about me.  Oh.  Wow.  Let's figure that out.  That sounds good.  October 2.  And a brand new jingle's coming in for the jingle contest.  Oh, yeah.  What?  Jingle.  Contest.  I don't know if you're pronouncing it.  No, I'm pronouncing it.  Jingle.  Yeah.  Come on back.  We're going to hear some yingles.  Serious Exit. 
[01:39:30]  It's the OP&E Show.  And softly spoken lies.  You never know just how you look through other people's eyes.  Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew. 
[01:40:00]  Ooh.  And we're back with the OP&E Show.  We got a lot to do here.  We got jingles for the jingle contest.  A lot of people pointing out on the Twitter yesterday going, hey, oh, fuck the rules say  that they're looking for audio, not necessarily  just jingles.  So you, sir, are wrong. 
[01:40:30]  You, sir.  So I guess we're doing O&A Audio, right?  Oh, yeah.  Could be a jingle, could be a little song,  could be a little something-something.  A jingle.  So the listeners were right on this one.  I got about 50 entries since yesterday.  Wow.  We're getting some really good ones now.  We're getting some ones that have made me laugh  in the office.  Want to play a few before we get into the other thing?  I'd love to.  And let's make sure we have enough time  to get to Jocktober today.  Yes.  All right. 
[01:41:00]  The contest opened to everyone except for the Canadians.  Yeah.  I don't know why the Canadians get fucked over every time.  Poor Canadians.  I think it's technically two different companies.  They are.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You're not allowed to have a radio company in two countries.  It's called the radio in two countries law.  It's very technical.  Yeah, yeah.  It's good law.  It is a good law.  It's very to the point.  It's an important law.  It sure is.  We got $2,000 up for grabs, courtesy of IHateStevenSinger.com. 
[01:41:30]  Steven Singer still doesn't really have us on his website.  He doesn't?  Not really.  He likes promoting Howard, even though we've done a lot for him.  Oh, Steven Singer.  Let's go to IHateStevenSinger.  I was in denial for a long time.  How does he not have that?  IHateStevenSinger.  Well, Sam typed in StevenSinger.com.  We've never given out his website.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, we have, Travis.  Oh.  Let me see.  See.  See, there's no O and A's. 
[01:42:00]  Where would...  No, anybody.  Yeah, try that one.  Yeah, try that.  See.  There's Mike and Mike ESPN.  Raw Dog.  Howard Stern.  Oh, we're in part of that.  Oh, being Anthony.  Yeah, shouldn't we be at the top, though?  It's probably out of that water.  I think it's chronological.  Oh.  What does that mean?  By time.  Time what?  When he went on?  Yeah, so like this was...  Yeah, this was Cherry Darts. 
[01:42:30]  Oh.  Remember that.  Anyway, he's given $2,000.  That's great.  Hey, who's that?  Aw.  Aw.  Is he coming up with runner-up prizes yet?  Well, I know we have some stuff.  I know we have like $500 gift cards that we can give.  I'm tightening my core.  Are you?  All right, let's play a few more entries for the jingle contest. 
[01:43:00]  Yes, jingle.  The audio contest.  Yeah.  Got some good ones on there.  We start with Jeff Hansen.  Okay, here's Jeff Hansen.  Oboe, O-O-B, Anthony, Gin, Gin, Gin, Gin, E-Rock's fan.

I didn't find that one very good.  Why?  I don't know.  Something about it I just didn't like.  You dropped the N-word.  You like that word.  It's true.  The next, uh, entry in the audio contest, certainly there's some jingles in there, is by a guy named, um, Edgar. 
[01:44:30]  Oh.  Oh.  The Arby and Anthony show.  there's lots  of laughs  to be hiding. 
[01:45:00]  That's very good.  That's terrible.  That's very good.  You don't like the guitar at the beginning?  Yeah, you had to put something there.  That is a great Edgar.  That was a good one.  That was a good winning piece.  I want to win the money.  The next entry  in the audio contest is  Jim Conrad. 
[01:45:30]  I know what's happening.  This is turning into the E-Rock contest.  By the way, I don't think it's helping.  Why does it always go back to him?  I don't think it's helping that somebody's filtering.  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Kick the can  I just love his style  And his voice  Yeah, that was original  I actually like him  Do you want to watch 
[01:50:00]  The leaf video?  Just part of his face  Oh, that's right  The shepherd of leaves  He's walking in the woods  The chain is walking  The radio ghost presents  The shepherd of leaves  From a bench in the town  To a bench in the trees  Under fallen old snow  Over fallen old leaves  Like a leaky old boat 
[01:50:30]  On an empty old sea  You leak till you're empty  When empty you're free  What?  It's too deep  I'd like to climb  Like a golden flower  Sunlight for bread  And turn with my power  In a ballroom dream  I don't know what he's saying 
[01:51:00]  It's like Roland  That could not dance  With the old river queen  Should sing me a song  In my dreams  Now I got a pain  In a race and everything  That I see  I don't know  Sounds like Indonesia  I don't get it  That is the part  I wanted to see  Is this a Slenderman video?

[01:59:30]  Sal trying to get fired  I don't know  It started  Sal tweeted a picture  Of E-Rock  Looking up  Some random news story  Doing nothing for the show  Oh shit  And he posted  A picture of his watch  In the photo  That said like  Eleven  Whatever  Oh no  As if to say  E-Rock's doing no work  Because Sal has vocally  Said he's frustrated  That he has to do  E-Rock work  And E-Rock doesn't have  To do that work  So then  You know  I told E-Rock  And told him  In front of everybody  I was like  You can't  Let Sal do this to you 
[02:00:00]  I said  You let me  And Travis  And Danny  And all these guys  Do it to you  And then you get  Walked on  Sal's the new guy  You can't let him  Do it to you  Yeah you gotta  Alpha male him  So Sal was kind of  He was taking shots  At him too  He was making fun  Of him for  Asking Roland  For free DVDs  He was making fun  Of him for getting  Shit signed  He was going in on him  E-Rock hit him  In the head  With a magazine  Oh shit  That was  That was the big comeback  E-Rock smacked him  With a magazine  But then  Sal  Violence in the workplace  Sal had a bitch fit 
[02:00:30]  About it  About how  I just don't understand  The physical  Blah blah blah blah  And threw this whole bitch fit  To the point where  E-Rock  Texted Sal  Said  I apologize  Oh cause E-Rock's  Afraid of the workplace  And then the next morning  Bought him breakfast  E-Rock is a fucking  E-Rock's a work cuckold  Sal  I'm waiting to hear this  This was yesterday  Now we're up to  Sal responded  To having the apology  And a free breakfast  By announcing to me 
[02:01:00]  Roland  Travis  And Troy  With E-Rock  Right in the room  He vocally said  You know  I would've  Like he was a piece of shit  He said  I would've respected him more  If he hadn't apologized  Oh shit  But he had to turn around  And apologize to me  And buy me breakfast  Oh man  Then Eric comes in  And he goes  He goes  Hey I got some  Live reads  I need you to bring them  Downstairs for me  That's what he said  Uh huh  Okay  Sure  Sal turns around  And goes  What? 
[02:01:30]  And Eric goes  I got some live reads  I just need you to bring them  Down to the traffic department  For me on 19  And he goes  What?  What the fuck?  No!  I'm not gonna bring  Shit down for you  You can use the exercise  Bring them down yourself  Go walk in traffic  Go walk in traffic  Good one  And we're all just sitting there  Going  What?  And Sal leaves for the day  He goes up to Eric  And he goes  Alright Eric  I'm leaving  I'll bring them down for you  Write down exactly  Where they need to go  Eric took like five minutes 
[02:02:00]  He found a pen  He found a post-it  He wrote down exactly  Where they need to go  And he goes  Here you go  And Sal reads it  And he looks at Eric  And he goes  Good  Now you know where  To fucking bring him  And he put him down  On his desk  And walked out  Wow  Holy shit  What's going on?  What the fuck?  Sal?  Sal  What's going on?  That's exactly what happened  I didn't misrepresent anything  Now why?  What's the problem Sal?  Well I was  I'm just getting fed up  With this shit  Pretty much  With the shit 
[02:02:30]  Around here  Or just with him?  No mainly with Eric  Yeah  It's just like  I used to like  Look down at Troy  For like always bitching  About Eric  And all that sort of stuff  But now  I've gotten to the point  Where I completely understand it  Now why is that?  Wow  What happened?  What put you over the edge?  It's just this stupid  This stupid shit like that  Like he initiated a job  But couldn't complete it  And had to pull a power move  By telling me to go downstairs  To bring a piece of paper downstairs  It's like  Just do it yourself  I'm working on other shit 
[02:03:00]  That I need to get done  But it sounded like  You started like  Getting on him  Before that point  I mean you tweeted the picture out  And all that  Yeah  That was just a  And he is your intern  I'm not an intern anymore  That's not nice  Oh see  No that was just the straw  That broke the count  You know you're going to be  Messing with the Iraq army  You can say it  There you go  I don't want to mess around  With that army  But no it's just that  Like I completely understand  You feel like you're an equal  To Iraq at this point right?  Not an equal  But just like  You feel above Iraq now 
[02:03:30]  Oh above Iraq  Do you think  Let me ask you this  Iraq's been working in radio  For a certain amount of time  Oh my god  Fucking  It's got to be what  30, 40 years now  Something like that  He is a Doogie  He is a Doogie Houser  He started very young  Yeah  You've been working in radio  Doogie big as a Houser  There's a Doogie on my Houser  So stupid  Sal you've been working in radio  How long?  A year  Oh no 
[02:04:00]  Who do you think  No not a year  You just got hired  Yeah  April  You're counting your internship  Six months  Okay  Six months  You be honest  And don't be  Be as you would be  In the back  I don't know if you're sure  Who do you think  Is more skilled  You or Iraq  When it comes to  O&A related stuff  I'd say  I'd say Eric  Without a doubt  Eric knows all those references  He has that like  Built up library  You know  He knows all that  That ins and outs of the show  But  I think if like  Something needs to get  Like produced technically  I can absolutely do better 
[02:04:30]  Than Eric  What about work ethic  Why it's just generally  Work ethic  Work ethic  And in terms of like  Pawning off responsibilities  I mean I don't pawn off anything  I get everybody's shit  That they pawn off to me  So yeah  I definitely work  More  Than  Than Eric  Yeah  Wow  Wow  Bold statement there  And then Eric's gonna play the part  Like well I got you hired here  Or all that sort of stuff  Did he  Everyone seems to like  To drop that line on me  Around here  Yeah I got you hired 
[02:05:00]  I got you hired  I had nothing to do with it  I didn't even know you were hired  Until I read the email  Right  I said it was a mistake then  I still say it's a mistake now  Did it bother you  If Sam thinks you were  An error  No I mean  I have respect for Sam  Because I know  The work that Sam does  He does a lot of  Things for the show  Fill me in someday  Exactly  We'd love to know  Evidence of this  It might have been an error  But there were  You know  His competition wasn't that good  No it was very bad  No it was horrible  I'll admit that 
[02:05:30]  Iraq what's going on  Why aren't you saying anything  Iraq comment  I was letting him speak  This is the same shit he pulled  When  You know  Before he was hired  When Kenny was  Constantly going to him  And said I need you to do this  I need you to do this  And then Sal blew up  Saying why do I have to do everything  Oh boy  Are you entitled  Oh I think I'm  You're entitled  No people  People have confidence  In him to do certain things  So when they constantly  Go to him to do it  Then all of a sudden  He starts pulling this shit  Why am I having to do everything  But why do you think 
[02:06:00]  He's getting on your shit  Because he thinks  It's an easy way  To carry favor with  With the staff  And maybe with the show  Because he doesn't feel like  The show likes him  Really  That's not the case  You're the one  Who's directly giving me  The most amount of work  On a consistent basis  That you could easily  Just do yourself  And I'm told from other people  Hey delegate it to Sal  So I go  Great  Let's do that  Who are these other people  Who are these other people  Who are these people  Name names  E-Rock does name names  Name names  Stupid  You're talking about Rob Cross 
[02:06:30]  Rob Cross is one of them  And he'll openly admit  That certain things  He said we should delegate  That to Sal  Okay  And that's what I do  So you think that's a good thing  By making you do less work  And giving me more work  No  It's you're the new guy  So shit that other people  Don't really want to do  After this point  Can be given to you  And it's accepted  Oh boy  Maybe not by you  But by management  Saying yeah  Give it to Sal  Okay  That's fine  But it's not fine  Because you complain about it  Right  Well no  I think that's a dumb mentality 
[02:07:00]  Why would you want to take  More work away from Eric  So you're saying that the bosses  In the back  Are having a dumb mentality  Wait  Are you saying that Eric  Does not have too much work  Like  Oh absolutely  Oh  So the literally he had  He gives to me  Oh  Oh shit  So you're saying like generally  People with a lot of work  Will then be like  You know what  You take care of this for me  But Eric doesn't have  That kind of work  Right  Because I'm sure  There wasn't a meeting  When Sal was  Talked about being hired  And then was finally hired  What would Sal's responsibilities be

[02:37:00]  They were on different  And programming and sales  They were on different floors  And they would  They would fucking fight  All the time  And somewhere along the line  I think it happened  With CBS  To be honest with you  They allowed sales  To completely run  The radio station  Who are the people  Oh sorry  It's stuck in my head  At least they were able  To secure a great prize  After all I was mentioning  A TJ Maxx  Yeah yeah  Oh so what are they giving away?  25 big ones  Damn  Yeah  You know  We need some kind of  Organic way 
[02:37:30]  To incorporate TJ Maxx  Into the show  We're thinking of  Who are the people  In your neighborhood  In TJ Maxx's neighborhood  And then they sit there  And go yeah okay  We can do that  The first suggestion  Was vetoed  She said how about  I could go there  And falsely report a rape  On the 911 call  I'll just keep saying  I've been raped  To TJ Maxx  I was looking at  Their wonderful  Discounted name brand items  And I was raped brutally

[02:41:00]  That's magic  Oh god  I forgot those days  It is infuriating  Magic  One of your jobs  As the radio DJ  Is to get the listener  To say the call letters  Right  That's right  The fans on the Facebook page  It's your favorite station  Yeah I mean no  They're recommending weird weird stuff  Who brings you the best rock music  And the greatest prizes  What's their slogan over there  You're number one for today's hit music  Yes  Less music more menopause  So they're not the one that feeds your need for rock 
[02:41:30]  No no  They're the number one for hit music  Oh wow  A lot of recommendations are coming in for magic 93.1  Which is 93 magic on Facebook  Oh  Goddamn rich cunts  Oh  Take us out fatso  Please look up comedian Jim Norton on Netflix  Thank you  Yeah  Roland pumps yogurt to child pictures of Danny Pagatucci  And uh  Oh this is just a fan of the show 
[02:42:00]  Who got the answer  Yeah  He wrote  Old Navy  What do I win cunts  Yeah  So  Lots of recommendations  That's nice  Well  Mary interrupts Chris' traffic report  Oh man  This is the station that does the local traffic  Keep it local guys  You know  That's how you compete with satellite radio  There's satellite now  There's internet radio  But you're a commodity  If you keep it local  Because people are always going to look to you  For weather  Time 
[02:42:30]  Traffic  You know what Pandora has  What  Or hasn't  Oh  Wait  Doesn't have  Pandora's lacking  I get it  Alright here's the traffic report  I blew it  One tree goes at one time  And like your bill of willows  They take forever  The cottonwoods take forever  You know what I hear  This is just a rumor  And I love to spread me some rumors  Apparently sports guy Jim Davis  Yeah  Doesn't enjoy raking his leaves  And it is leading to a little bit of  A bit of a scuttlebutt in the neighborhood  Yeah  He doesn't clean it up  He says he goes out 
[02:43:00]  And he moves them into piles  That's the rumor  Which is awesome  Which is awesome  Oh wow  Which is awesome  That's terrible  I was hoping it was like a really juicy rumor  Yeah  Like this guy refuses to do his leaves  And they found bloody child underpants  Under the leaves  Well that would be some juicy gossip  Yeah  In the neighborhood  It wasn't this time  That's the reason why he puts his leaves in piles 
[02:43:30]  That would be a great rumor  Jesus  Jimmy's tired  There could be no worse sight  Than bloody child's underpants  Especially the under  That's just such a  They're under leaves in front of your house  It's such a bad thing  You have some splating to do  On the Facebook page  They posted four truly scary facts  That no one tells you about Halloween  Oh that's kind of fun  I ain't allowed to have nobody ring my bell  I hate Halloween  Aw  That's that court order 
[02:44:00]  Uncle Paul  Well it's time for the court order thing  And then one of their listeners responded  With a comment that says  Die in a fire  You bunch of lousy cunts  Which  I don't know what kind of listeners they have  That's not really nice  That's very aggressive  It's very strange  Mary's not done by the way  With her inane stories of the sports guy  And his dumb leaves  And 12th to North  Can I see the sign  Probably not  We need Daylight Savings  And kick in and take the glass  Oh I can  You know what else we need  Orchard meets the pool 
[02:44:30]  Something  Oh that was helpful  Learn to swim  Contact Parks and Rec  Jim Davis needs one of these  There you go buddy  Now the blowers  You've got to rake them  You can't use it  There's never been a blower  Made this powerful  And I am no genius  But all the time that he's taken  To go out there  And just move them into piles  Couldn't he have just gone ahead  And move it out to the street  Probably  And he could have been done  Oh boy  That's great stuff  Thank you  More about the leaves  Nothing about the leaves  She wasn't done with that story  But apparently she is done  With her Facebook page  Oh it's down  It's down 
[02:45:00]  The Facebook page is down  Gone  Why  I'll bet you the weather guy  Didn't like the leaves taunting  Or something  No no  That's probably what it was  Yeah no they're  It's causing a scuttlebutt  In the neighborhood  Their Facebook page  No longer exists at the moment  That's too bad  A scuttlebutt  Yeah that's terrible  It's gone  If you wanted to talk to them  On Facebook  You cannot  Mike is saying  Our live reads  Are better than this  What did you hear  The leaves story  Yeah it was good  It was good  I liked it  Causing a scuttlebutt  In the neighborhood  Right he puts it into piles 
[02:45:30]  Instead of actually cleaning it up  You see  Why wouldn't he just  Take it out to the street  Bloody children's underpants  Right  Bloody child's underpants  Something like that  I gotta retweet this  Oh  What you gonna do  When the tree comes down on you  And it's like  Oh no  It's this  Leg drop in a tree  On to Scott Shannon's house  I got a tree  I got a tree  On my house  There's a tree  On Scott Shannon's house  What  That guy gets to retweet today

Just a little yeah  It was quick  Going into break  Very quick  I hope they blasted their fans  For being so dirty  Yeah  It's disgusting  All their bits are very quick  So what  They had 20-30 seconds to do  Just about yeah  I hope we go  Our fans  Hear us talking about them  Our fans go to their Facebook page 
[02:53:00]  And have to see all that offensive stuff  From their fans  That's uh  I don't appreciate that  They owe us an apology  Exactly  I hope they didn't  Have to not do  These are the people in your neighborhood today  Oh no  So this is going to be what  A quick 10 second sound bite  How long is this?  Two and a half minutes  They went on  Regular fucking radio  Where they play music  For two and a half minutes  They talked more about us  Than anything else  That's forever  Combined  That's like us talking about something 
[02:53:30]  For nine hours  Yeah  Well maybe they liked it so much  That they were  I bet they were playing some  They probably had some laughs  What's the tone?  What's the  Yeah what's the tone of this?  It's a little like  Golly gee?  Yeah like  We're all about having fun  But  Maybe  Maybe they discuss some things  That they offer  That you guys don't  Oh  Like local traffic  And weather together  Maybe  Oh shit  They didn't take that angle  Did they?  Maybe they took a local angle 
[02:54:00]  I've got to hear this  Because their stupid radio wizard  Said you know  That's what you got  That they don't  I mean look  Local  After listening to this  Yeah I gotta agree  That you know  They are offering something  Alright here we go  Oh boy  Oh no  Magic 93.1  It is the morning buzz  I'm marrying Chris 7  I gotta tell you  You hear the excitement  They love that  They're being featured  On Jack Tober  You can hear it in their voice  I think it's out there  I think the word is out  It's finally some energy  I think the word is out though 
[02:54:30]  That you know  Of course it is  That Opie and Anthony  Are you know  Talking about some radio shows  For Jack Tober  They love it  And if you're picked  I think it's kind of like  It's an honor  It's an honor  Yeah  36 and evidently  We are under attack  From the big boys  Ooh the big boys  Brilliant  They've got nothing better  To do this morning  Oh it's the  Nothing better to do angle  I love you  I love the  Nothing better to do angle  The same stuff we've heard  For years  Yeah  Nothing better to do  And it's actually correct  We don't 
[02:55:00]  You're right  I swear to you  If you added it up  We've talked more today  Than they will in a month  On their radio show  But we have nothing better to do  The best part is when they go  Ooh the big boys  Are attacking us  Shut down the Facebook page  Shut it down  Oh my god  This is great  Did you see it coming  They were going with the  Nothing better to do angle  I didn't see nothing better to do  I didn't either  God dude  How many times  Have we heard that  Over the years  It's so fucking funny  To hear that  Hey you've got nothing  Better to do than to go 
[02:55:30]  Yeah  No you're right  This is fun  We have nothing better to do  We don't have to worry about  Yeah  Thanks and evidently  We are under attack  From the big boys  Big boys  Brilliant  They've got nothing better  To do this morning  Opie and Anthony  Than mess with  Small market radio  Alright  True that  But you know  We got the guy to react  That he's a little more  Excited now  Than he was  Oh is that funny  Oh he's right though  Oh yeah  Just messing with  A little show  That's just trying  To put themselves 
[02:56:00]  On a tiny little map  Somewhere  Just trying to  Chug along  Draw a check  You know what  They're fucking right  We're assholes  Anthony then mess  With small market radio  And what did they do  By messing with us  This morning Chris  So they told us  To go on our Facebook  And talk about our competition  No  No  We didn't see any of that  That's your fans  They're very dirty  Yeah you got dirty fans  You just didn't realize  We never tell  We actually try to  Keep our fans away  From the websites  And what not  We tell them  Don't go to the Facebook page 
[02:56:30]  I laugh when I read the stuff  It's funny  Haven't we had news clips  In the past  Oh yeah  We have right  What was that one  Do you remember offhand  No I don't remember  But I know it was like  There was  Because there was  The newspaper  Last year  There was the newspaper article  That turned into  A local TV news story  About us  Being assholes  And then that's why  Andy Dick came in here  Like a little while after that  And he goes  Well those guys are assholes  I read about them  And bah bah bah  I fucking hate Andy Dick  I'm so glad 
[02:57:00]  I blew that off  Fuck him  So they told us  To go on our Facebook  And talk about our competition  And talk about how we suck  And local radio is terrible  And terrestrial radio sucks  But didn't they start in  Yeah  So they had people  Go to our Facebook  Oh they got you there  Turnabout's fair play  Gotcha  But day one we said it sucked  Yeah  I haven't been saying it ever since  What?  It was the Idaho Statesman  That published an article  The Idaho Statesman  And what's the headline?  Uh  104.3 FM hosts 
[02:57:30]  Survive Opie and Anthony attack  It was for Randy and Alana  Maybe we'll have to go back to Idaho  Do a follow up  Because the paper's attacking us  The vulgar 48 minute annihilation  Yeah  Yeah read more  Oh yeah I remember them  You remember them?  Yeah yeah  Yeah  Oh I remember them  The halo on the guy  It's one of the craziest things  That has ever happened  To the morning duo 
[02:58:00]  It's beyond mean and crude  Oh right yeah  Alana says it was hard  There were a couple of times  I was bawling my eyes out  Because it just hurt  Jesus Christ  I would be  That just depresses me  I would be bawling  And then we'd have to go back on air  And I'd be like  And I'd like quick blow my nose  Dry my tears  And suck it up  Oh my god  Jeez  Maybe she's kidding  How bad was it?  She might be kidding  She's exaggerating I'm sure  The bizarre beatdown  Was part of Opie and Anthony's  Jocktober  Jocktober

[02:59:00]  Oh no  See that isn't  That's not cool  That isn't cool  Oh man  We didn't ask anybody to say that  No  God it's stupid  We admit it  Our fans are some of the most  Despicable people  You'll ever fucking meet  They're terrible  What is Travis doing?  What's the next line?  I do remember this article now  It's horrible  Travis is having a hard time  Getting this one out  Alana 
[02:59:30]  Yeah  She was talking about emails  That she would get  Uh huh  Like I'll open it  And it will say  Alana I want to rape you  Oh Jesus  Why would they rape you?  That's a threat  I don't like that at all  We didn't tell anyone to do that  Or hey C word  I want to rape you  That's not funny  That is vicious  And Travis  That's vicious  And Travis is laughing at it too  I'm crying  It's terrible  That is  And Travis just thinks  It's the greatest  He's got six cents of humor 
[03:00:00]  That's awful  Travis he's probably  The one writing the emails  Couldn't even mess with  Small market radio  And what did they do  By messing with us  This morning Chris  So they told us  To go on our Facebook  And talk about our competition  And talk about how  We suck  And local radio is terrible  And terrestrial radio sucks  But didn't they start  In  Yeah so they had people  Go to our Facebook  And post like  All kinds of nasty stuff  Oh it's awful  I mean nasty  Nasty  I love this  I mean nasty 
[03:00:30]  Nasty  I love the interaction  Between the two shows  It's wonderful  It's awful  It's awful  It's awful  Just think of the stuff  We saw  They had to see  The same shit  And we see that stuff  Every day  They saw the big  Fucking prolapsed ass  With a giant shit log  Going into a woman's mouth  Fucking snot being blown into  And all they're trying to do  Is mind their own business  Have some fun  Provide some entertainment  Oh it's terrible  I hear it in their voices  They're a little excited  They are excited 
[03:01:00]  It's a little something  Out of the ordinary  I dare say  They're a little flattered  Their mundane existence  Yep  Has been lifted up today  We had people  Go to our Facebook  And post like  All kinds of nasty stuff  Oh it's awful  I mean nasty  Nasty stuff  Terrible photos  Terrible remarks  So we have no Facebook page  Right now by the way  So  There's no Facebook page  Listen now  They were talking about

[03:03:30]  You know  Birthday whoopins  Obviously something they don't do  Oh they're satellite guys  You know  So they don't even care about their community  Or informing their community  That's right  He's right about that  Of course not  That was actually correct  We hate our communities  I don't give a fuck about my community  I care about my dick  And the mouth on it  I care about getting my ass eaten  And smelling my own farts  You don't give a fuck  If there's homeless people  Wandering around your community  I don't give a fuck  If I came home today  And everybody in my building 
[03:04:00]  Was dead  I wouldn't care  So take that community shit  Shove it up your ass  Cause Jimmy don't give a hoot  I don't give a shit  As long as they get my food up  When I order it  I spy on my neighbors  With a helicopter  With a camera on it  That's how much  That's how much  I give a shit about my community  You don't even care about  Landing aircraft  You don't care about our communities  No  I was holding out some hope 
[03:04:30]  That they were having  A little fun with it  And being sarcastic  About what little  Fucking local radio  Has to offer  They don't even care about  Their community  Their community  Community  Community  Shame on you  I actually take down  Megan's  Megan's law warning  Just let the fun commence  Holy fuck  That's funny  Like guys  You know  So they don't even care  About their community

[03:05:30]  We're making satellite money  And don't give a shit  About our community  That's right  They hit the nail  On the fucking head  Exactly  They should work here  Holy shit  That's hilarious  That's the angle  All these stations  I've taken over the years  Traffic  Keep it local  That's something  They don't have  Keep it local  Weather  That's right people  And you know  What's interesting  Is compared  We're free  Yeah  Oh yeah  Last time I checked  We don't cost anything  To listen to

[03:06:30]  But I don't  You know  You shouldn't have  Made fun of the fact  That it's free  You know  Because it is free  Yeah  Yeah  We want to be proud of that  That should be looked at  As a strength  God damn it  Not a weakness  Nothing made fun of  Oh god  I want to do a whole program  On radio wizards  How do we do this  Yeah  We could have a radio wizard  Round table  And have them come in  And talk to you  Well I want to  I want to bring in  Some radio guys  And do that  Inside shit  Yeah  This is fucking  We don't cost anything

[03:08:00]  My community  Let me think  My community  Is full of Jewish people  I know that much  I keep my lawn nice  Good  Good for you  Actually I don't  The Mexicans  That I hire do  Support local business  I support local business  That's true  That's true  If I ever need a key mate  I go to the local hardware store guy  You're a blight  On the community  And so  There we go 
[03:08:30]  With that  Interesting  Losers  Okay  So  Well they don't get to  I mean do you ever hear  Like you know  One of them  Say I've never even heard of them  Do they ever go yard sailing  Do you even find yard sales  Where do they live  Where are they at  New York  Oh okay  Now see  And see that's how foolish they are  If I was  If I had that show  I would be like  So you gotta go get on the subway  And see how many different pieces  Of chewed candy  And gum you could find  Under the seats  That would be entertaining  Wouldn't it  Wouldn't hurt anybody's feelings  I feel a little  A little slighted this morning

[03:09:30]  She stands up  And then she bends over  To look under one of the seats  And a big black guy  Grabs her head  And shoves it right into his dick  While you're down there missy  Or she gets caught  Between the train and the platform  She gets twisted  Between the train  And they tell her that  Once they let the train go  And the pressure's released  She'll die  Yeah  Is that true  I don't know  Why wouldn't you put a belt on it  And then what  Or just live at the platform  Make it really tight  You could actually  Just bring a lamp  Cut you off at the midsection 
[03:10:00]  Sew you up  And then you could walk around  With Dana the intern  That would be entertaining  Wouldn't it  Wouldn't hurt anybody's feelings  I feel a little  A little slighted this morning  If the listeners really care  About small market radio  That's amazing  Yeah  So there you go  So no Facebook for a while  Okay  We'll use our Twitter  That's probably an act too  Oh no  Do we have a YouTube still  Who knows  We have a MySpace  Hey at least we got like  A lot more users there  There you go  Magic  American family  Magic
