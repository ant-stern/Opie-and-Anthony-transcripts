<pre> Alright, to WNEW management.  After hearing a song played on your station yesterday called Kill a Kitten, I was angry  and disturbed.  Are you kidding me?  People just don't know how to have fun anymore.  Who sent this?  It's disappointing that a station of your caliber would resort to such a low level as  to give airtime to a song like this.  In my opinion, it was also very irresponsible.  There are enough deviant individuals out there that may act on the recommendations in that  to kill a kitten.  Come on. 
[00:30]
 An on air acknowledgement of the station's poor judgment in airing the song would be  indicated.  Would be indicated, I guess.  I would appreciate hearing your view on this incident and the action the station plans  to take in addressing it.  Action.  They have to take action.  And here's the threat.  If no action is taken to attempt to remedy this irresponsible and disturbing situation,  I will join others in calling your advertisers and boycotting their products.  Needless to say, we would also discontinue any play of WNEW in our hospital. 
[01:00]
 Oh, it's a veterinarian hospital.  Oh, a vet hospital.  It makes a little more sense.  It makes more sense.  I appreciate your time and would welcome your comments.  Please factor call at your convenience.  So we should put this aside so management can read this.  Yeah, put that in a safe spot so they could...  Yeah, right in that file there.  That's good.  That's good.  What a bunch of idiots. 
[01:30]
 How many cats you got up?  I got two thinking of getting a third.  Aren't they great?  Yeah, we love cats.  I have four cats.  I love scratching under their little chin.  I come home at night.  What did you see when you dropped me off at the house?  What's JD doing?  He stands up at the door.  Waiting for you.  With his paws against the window.  Waiting for me.  Yes.  And we get the song.  Oh my God.  It's called a joke.  Please, if they don't get it, screw them.  Well, I guess we need to play the song again. 
[02:00]
 Yeah, just in case you missed it.  Alright, you're hanging with Opie and Anthony. 
[02:30]
 Thanks for checking us out once again today.  We definitely appreciate that.  You know that by now.  The Rock of New York 1027 WNEW.  That's Eve 6 Inside Out.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Rockin' and rollin'.  Say hi to John in Westchester, Opie. 
[03:00]
 Bought a copy of Demented World.  Coconuts on 51st and 6th.  He got the last copy.  Tell him to order more.  Thanks John.  Well, our CD, I figured out that our CD is out there, but they only have one copy in  every record store.  As soon as that copy is bought, that particular record store doesn't bother, you know, refilling  the bin with another one.  Well, our record company is like something out of Spinal Tap.  Well, we don't want to saturate the New York market.  God forbid.  Yeah, that'll happen. 
[03:30]
 We only have a million listeners a week.  And let's say if 1% of those people want to buy our CD, that would be 10,000.  Oh, now you're making a good percentage.  That's the math again.  10,000, let's say.  Alright.  That's impossible.  There's only about a couple hundred copies in all of Manhattan to be had.  It's like a scavenger hunt to try to find our Demented World CD.  Yeah.  Well, thanks John.  And people love it.  I know.  We've sold over 40, 45,000 copies all over the country. 
[04:00]
 We just can't seem to get any interest going in New York with the CD.  Speaking of which, this guy, Ogie.  Hi guys, I got your CD yesterday at one of the record stores in Greenacres Mall.  I like the CD a lot, but I wish you had the Dark Vulgar skit on that.  Any chance of making a new CD?  Well, Ogie, let me tell you something.  Yeah, there is a chance of us making another CD.  Yes.  As soon as we get some lovely ratings here in New York, we are going to put out another  CD.  With some of your favorite little ditties. 
[04:30]
 We got enough material for two more CDs.  Yeah.  So if you like Demented World, the few people out there that do have it, there will be another  one eventually.  Yeah.  Alright, later this hour, when you hear Tom Petty's, don't do me like that.  We're going to be the 10th caller to win a $50 multi-sport passport to Chelsea Piers  and qualify to have a Super Bowl party thrown at your house.  The Rock of New York 1027 WNEW Black Crowes from By Your Side kicking my heart around.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey man.  What's up, what's up, what's up? 
[05:00]
 We're pretty excited.  We got Lewis Black coming in today at what?  Five o'clock, Rick?  Five or four.  Five or four?  He might be here in the next few minutes.  I'll be here in the next few minutes.  Alright, we love Lewis Black from Comedy Central.  He's fun.  With Jon Stewart on Comedy Central, it's so much better.  The Daily Show.  Yeah.  So much better.  Look at that arrogant ass wipe off the air.  Oh my God.  Yeah, he's going to do a great job for Tom Schneider.  Sure he will.  Yeah, Craig.  Good luck.  I'm just, it's kind of bad that Brian Unger isn't with the show anymore. 
[05:30]
 Yeah, I don't know what happened with that because he's a friend of the show as well.  Brian, if you're listening, call us up and tell us what the hell is going on with you.  Yeah.  Your sarcasm is greatly appreciated.  Yeah, he's funny.  He did some fabulous bits for the Daily Show and I don't know what happened.  He had a problem with someone because he just kind of quit.  Maybe he had a problem with the host.  Yeah, but the host, Jon?  No, no.  What's his name again?  Oh, Craig?  Craig.  Well, he quit after he knew that Craig was leaving. 
[06:00]
 Oh really?  Yeah, which is kind of strange.  Maybe someone could let us know what Brian's up to because we miss him.  He came up with some great bits for us.  Oh yeah.  The sounds of a crane.  The sounds of cranes.  All right, we got lots of faxes here.  Steve writes, can you ask Stephen Lynch if it's okay for me to record a heavy metal version  of Kill a Kitten?  Please comment.  I just picked up a multi-track recorder to start pounding out hits and I think that would  sell a few hundred thousand.  Thanks.  I think Stephen would be flattered if there was a heavy metal version of Kill a Kitten 
[06:30]
 out there.  Obviously, you have to check with Stephen.  No.  Just go ahead and do it.  Yeah, go ahead.  Record it.  And we'll play it for Stephen.  Definitely.  We encourage all the bands that listen to the Open Anthony show to send in their ditties.  We're still looking for more songs for our Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  And so far we've had a few come in but nothing worth playing on the air yet.  So keep those flying in.  Also, we're getting a fax from Christine. 
[07:00]
 Stop teasing me and divulge the Dave Matthews info, please.  We don't have all the info yet but we do know that Dave Matthews is coming in with Tim Reynolds  this coming Tuesday and they're going to play on Ralph D'Ottawa's show.  That's all we know at this point.  We don't know when, you know, what time or anything like that.  And we're also going to get some listeners down here to check it out.  That's huge.  I don't remember Dave Matthews ever coming to a radio station to play live.  So that's going to be something to look forward to as well.  And speaking of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, Anthony. 
[07:30]
 Yes.  This is, I mean, we love when the listeners get involved with our show.  There's a guy, Gary.  Gary writes on the Instant Feedback, hey guys, great show.  My wife said she would make me a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club if I would design  and host a website for the club.  Oh, I said, what the hell?  The whole site will be up on the net tomorrow.  We have a member picture area, chat links and a message board.  A lot of work for a Hummer, but I've worked for less.  Stay tuned for the site's grand opening.  I'll email you the preview URL tomorrow. 
[08:00]
 We have parked the domain name Hummer Club dot Hummer Club dot com.  And that's Gary, a new member of the club.  Wow.  We'll have to pop a link up.  Yes.  If it's good, we'll definitely pop a link through the WNEW website.  And we do not frown upon people making websites.  Yes.  There's a bunch of websites dedicated to Opiate Anthony.  I used to be quite the little webmaster myself, Opiate, but kind of steered away from that. 
[08:30]
 Got a lot more to worry about here at WNEW than having fun and making websites.  We'll get back to doing that.  We used to have an unbelievable underground website.  Oh my God, the smut that went on this thing.  It was great stuff.  And we'll get it up and running eventually.  Yes.  We're still trying to figure all this out.  We need more listeners and then we'll start expanding our little empire.  Figure out what your people like and then put it on the web.  But if you are interested, a lot of our old bits are on, what is the name of the website?  Opac.com, I think. 
[09:00]
 Is that it?  Opac.com, I believe.  There's a lot of old stuff.  Good.  I've heard from a few of the listeners down here in New York that they're starting up  some new websites dedicated to us, which is very flattering.  We like that.  Yes, we do.  We encourage that stuff.  We encourage you guys to get involved with our show.  Yes.  All right.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, Rolling Stones.  She's so cold.  It's Opiate Anthony.  And boy, Anthony, a tiger was killed in Jersey last night.  Really? 
[09:30]
 I didn't see that story on any news or hear it.  Yeah, no one in the radio.  Talking about it.  So maybe we should spend a few minutes talking about the tiger that was killed in Jersey  overnight.  Everyone's talking about that.  Enough about the stupid tiger, OK?  They killed a kitten.  Yeah.  See, the cops.  Yeah, the cops killed a kitten.  And the song we play, Kill the Kitten, is just for fun.  I guess they had to.  They shot it at 930 after tranquilizer darts failed to fill the animal. 
[10:00]
 Yes.  Yeah.  Patrick Ewing out there.  What are you saying?  Well, I'm not saying why would Patrick Ewing come in handy to catch a tiger?  He just likes tigers, I heard.  Really?  A lot about Patrick Ewing lately.  That's all I'm trying to say.  That's all.  You want to elaborate on that at all?  No.  No.  No, I think you can finish the thought in your own head.  Why didn't you say what you said when the mics were off? 
[10:30]
 What about a spear and a loin cloth?  What?  Yeah.  What?  Oh, Opie, you're so, so confused.  I didn't put the thought process together.  It was fragmented.  If you're trying to somehow say that Patrick Ewing looks like he belongs in a loin cloth  in Africa.  I didn't say that.  Well, I think that's what you're saying, that he should be hunting tigers. 
[11:00]
 I did not say that.  I said they should send Patrick Ewing out to Jersey to kill the tiger last night.  Not to kill a tiger, to check it out.  You're severely mistaken.  It's a Siberian tiger, Opie.  Has nothing to do with the African tigers.  Tigers, yes.  So actually, I don't even think there are tigers in Africa.  So my joke isn't even accurate.  Well, you're the one who said that Patrick Ewing looks like Sharkazulu.  Well, what?  He does. 
[11:30]
 He just looks like the guy that played Sharkazulu on the miniseries.  What's that?  So?  That's very funny.  That's all.  You're sure not playing basketball, right?  No.  Wait, are you paying attention to basketball?  No, not at all.  I said I wouldn't pay attention.  You said you weren't going to watch one game.  I didn't watch.  Because you are so pissed.  I did not watch.  I just read about it.  How do you know? 
[12:00]
 I just read about it a little bit in the paper today.  You watched.  I swear I didn't watch.  But I am like a crackass.  Are you freaking out?  I'm really trying not to pay attention, but I'm slowly getting sucked back in.  You just play PlayStation.  Is it true that Spreewell scored 27 points last night?  Is that what I'm reading?  That's let me look at the paper.  Yes, the trial is 27 points.  I said I wouldn't follow the season.  How about that?  He didn't choke. 
[12:30]
 Very good.  Hi, N.E.W.  899 Spree.  N.E.W.  You're on the air.  899 Spree.  Hello.  Hi, I'm here.  Hi, what's up?  Who is this?  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, I just wanted to tell you guys.  You guys are talking about Patrick Ewing?  Yeah.  He's from Jamaica.  Yeah, I know.  But what are you guys saying?  He's from the Great African Plains.  Well, we didn't.  Anthony said that he looks like Shaka Zulu.  I thought he was from the Serengeti.  Who is Shaka Zulu? 
[13:00]
 You never saw the mini-series on Channel 5?  You like years ago?  Oh, I remember that.  Shaka Zulu.  Hey, he kind of looked like Shaka Zulu.  That's all.  Yeah, but I've been a Nick Francis ever since I was a kid.  I loved them guys.  You know, no matter what they do, I still love them.  And you're watching.  What?  Did you watch the game last night?  Yeah.  Oh, tell me about it.  Spreewell went a little ballistic in the third quarter, which I found was amazing.  I think you've got to give him a chance.  Did he score 17 points like the paper said?  Yeah, he did. 
[13:30]
 In the third quarter?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a big Nick fan.  I was brought up as the oldest.  I got two younger brothers, but I was like, oh, daddy's little girl on this hat wants  to make games with them.  Yeah.  In the 70s when they were the greatest.  Well, my dad turned me on to Hoops.  I would be up in bed as just a little tyke, and I would hear Dave the Butcher.  Yeah.  But I always thought his name was Dave the Butcher.  It's like, wow, Dave touching.  Dave the Butcher is scoring a lot of points tonight.  Yeah.  Well, that was it.  That was it when you grew up in New York. 
[14:00]
 Well, this is wonderful, Mikey.  The Charles Spreewell in his niche debut last night is scoring 27 points.  Fantastic.  I'm a fan.  Got to give him a lot of credit.  Give him a lot of credit.  He comes into the garden with a lot of people skeptical of his abilities.  You guys are shot to hell, but it's great.  It's classic.  You guys are bringing a lot of fun to EW, I'm telling you.  Hey, thank you very much.  All right.  I'll let you know.  Hey, who's your favorite?  I'm going to go with the guy with the big red shirt.  I'm going to go with the guy with the big red shirt.
