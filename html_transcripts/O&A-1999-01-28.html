<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a listener’s furious fax protesting their playing of the song "Kill a Kitten," threatening a boycott.  Opie and Anthony responded by playing the song again, mocking the complaint. This led to a discussion about the poor sales of their own CD, "Demented World," despite strong regional sales.  Several listener calls followed, addressing both the CD and the "Kill a Kitten" controversy.  The planned appearance of comedian Lewis Black was mentioned, along with commentary on personnel changes at *The Daily Show*, specifically the departures of Brian Unger and Craig Kilborn.  Another listener called in to discuss plans for a website dedicated to the show's "Tuesday Night Hummer Club."

A substantial portion of the show focused on the recent killing of a Siberian tiger in New Jersey, which sparked a series of jokes, initiated by Anthony and continued by callers, comparing Patrick Ewing's appearance to Shaka Zulu. This evolved into a broader discussion about basketball, the Knicks, and Latrell Sprewell's performance. A caller recounted a movie theater riot stemming from someone yelling "Patrick Ewing" during the *Mighty Joe Young* trailer, highlighting racial tensions. Opie then shared a personal anecdote about his inappropriate use of the n-word as a teenager.  The conversation shifted to the controversy surrounding the word "niggardly" used by a Washington, D.C. mayoral aide, with Opie and Anthony offering their own humorous, albeit potentially offensive, takes on the word.  A listener won a Super Bowl party contest, prompting humorous exchanges about the winner's location and party possibilities.  Lewis Black then joined the show, engaging in conversations with Opie and Anthony about the Pope, Andrew Dice Clay, and the political climate surrounding the Clinton impeachment.

Continuing with Lewis Black, the conversation included a humorous anecdote about a possible "Elizabethan Siberian tiger" sighting in New Jersey and a listener call expressing morbid curiosity about the handling of earthquake victims’ bodies. The hosts then discussed the relative dangers of natural disasters, with Opie suggesting relocation for those in earthquake-prone areas. Several tangents followed, including discussions of Canadians smuggling Viagra into the US; a listener's humorous account of sexual satisfaction while listening to the show; the Pope's Popemobile; an inappropriate joke about Carol Miller; a new nasal Viagra spray; Opie’s experiences with ineffective birth control and his high school pregnancy test business; and Cher’s Super Bowl performance.  A significant portion focused on the upcoming Super Bowl, including sarcastic commentary on pre-game coverage and the halftime show.  The hosts announced a listener contest: the tenth caller would win a $50 gift certificate and a Super Bowl party at their home, hosted by Opie and Anthony. Finally, a female caller and her husband detailed their successful experience with the "Hummer technique" from Laura Korn's book, "52 Invitations to Great Sex," describing the technique involving alternating hot and cold liquids during blindfolded oral sex.  The segment concluded with promotion of the book and the hosts' upcoming appearances at Caroline's and in San Antonio.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, to WNEW Management.  After hearing a song played on your station yesterday called Kill a Kitten,  I was angry and disturbed.  Are you kidding me?  People just don't know how to have fun anymore.  Who sent this?  It's disappointing that a station of your caliber would resort to such a low level  as to give airtime to a song like this.  In my opinion, it was also very irresponsible.  There are enough deviant individuals out there that may act on the recommendations in that song  as to how to kill a kitten. 
[00:00:30]  Come on.  An on-air acknowledgement of the station's poor judgment in airing the song would be indicated.  Would be indicated, I guess.  Okay.  I would appreciate hearing your view on this incident  and the action the station plans to take in addressing it.  Action.  They have to take action.  And here's the threat.  If no action is taken to attempt to remedy this irresponsible and disturbing situation,  I will join others in calling your advertisers and boycotting their products.  It's needless to say, we would also discontinue any playing of WNAW in our hospital. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, it's a veterinarian hospital.  Oh, a vet hospital.  Oh, okay.  Makes a little more sense.  I appreciate your time and would welcome your comments.  Please fax or call it your convenience.  So we should put this aside so management can read this.  Yeah, put that in a safe spot.  Okay.  So they could, uh...  Yeah, right in that file there.  There you go.  That's good.  That's good.  What a bunch of idiots. 
[00:01:30]  How many cats you got up?  I got two, thinking of getting a third.  Aren't they great?  Yeah, we love cats.  I have four cats.  Mm-hmm.  I love scratching under their little chin.  Mm-hmm.  I come home at night.  Mm-hmm.  You see, when you drop me off at the house, what's J.D. doing?  He stands up at the door.  Waiting for you.  With his paws against the window.  Yeah.  Waiting for me.  Yes.  It's called a joke.  And we get the song.  Oh, my God.  It's called a joke.  Please, if they don't get it, screw them.  Well, I guess we need to play the song again. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, just in case you missed it.  If he loveth Jesus, he must kill a kitten.  Throw him at a train.  Make him snort cocaine.  Drown him in a lake.  Bake a kitty cake.  Flush him down the can.  Hit him with your van. 
[00:02:30]  Stick some TNT up his caputti.  Do what you must do.  As long as you kill a kitten.  All right, you're hanging with Opie and Anthony.  Thanks for checking us out once again today.  We definitely appreciate that.  You know that by now.  The Rock of New York.  1027 WNEW.  That's Eve 6.  Inside Out.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Rocking and rolling.  Say hi to John in Westchester.  Opie bought a copy of Demented World. 
[00:03:00]  Right.  Coconuts on 51st and 6th.  He got the last copy.  Tell him to order more.  Thanks, John.  Well, our CD.  I figured out that our CD is out there, but they only have one copy in every record store.  And as soon as that copy is bought, that particular record store doesn't bother, you know, refilling the bin with another one.  Well, our record company is like something out of Spinal Tap.  Well, we don't want to saturate the New York market.  God forbid. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, that'll happen.  We only have a million listeners a week.  And let's say if 1% of those people want to buy our CD, that would be 10,000.  Oh, now you're making a good percentage.  That's the math thing again.  10,000, let's say.  All right.  That's impossible.  There's only about a couple hundred copies in all of Manhattan.  Yeah.  To be had.  It's like a scavenger hunt to try to find our Demented World CD.  Yeah.  Well, thanks, John.  And people love it.  I know.  We've sold over 40,000, 45,000 copies all over the country. 
[00:04:00]  We just can't seem to get any interest going in New York with the CD.  Speaking of which, this guy, Ogie.  Hi, guys.  I got your CD yesterday at one of the record stores in Green Acres Mall.  I like the CD a lot, but I wish you had the dark vulgar skit on that.  Any chance of making a new CD?  Well, Ogie, let me tell you something.  Yeah, there is a chance of us making another CD.  Yes.  As soon as we get some lovely ratings here in New York, we are going to put out another CD.  With some of your favorite little ditties. 
[00:04:30]  We got enough material for two more CDs.  Yeah.  So if you like Demented World, the few people out there that do have it, there will be another one eventually.  Yeah.  All right.  Later this hour, when you hear Tom Petty's Don't Do Me Like That, be the 10th caller to win a $50 multi-sport passport to Chelsea Piers  and qualify to have a Super Bowl party thrown at your house.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW Black Crows from by your side, kicking my heart around.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, man.  What's up?  What's up? 
[00:05:00]  What's up?  We're pretty excited.  We got Lewis Black coming in today at what?  Five o'clock, Rick?  Five or four.  Five or four?  He might be here in the next few minutes.  I'll be here in the next few minutes.  All right.  We love Lewis Black from Comedy Central.  He's fun.  And with Jon Stewart on Comedy Central, it's so much better.  The Daily Show.  Yeah.  So much better.  Got that arrogant jerk off.  Ass wipe off the air.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, he's going to do a great job for Tom Schneider.  Sure he will.  Yeah.  Yeah, Craig.  Good luck to you.  I'm just, it's kind of bad that Brian Unger isn't with the show anymore. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, I don't know what happened with that because he's a friend of the show as well.  Brian, if you're listening, call us up and tell us what the hell's going on with you.  Yeah.  Your sarcasm is greatly appreciated.  Yeah, he's funny.  He did some fabulous bits for the Daily Show.  And I don't know what happened.  He had a problem with someone because he just kind of quit.  Maybe he had a problem with the host.  Yeah, but the host, John?  No, no.  What's his name?  Oh, Craig?  Craig.  Well, he quit after he knew that Craig was leaving. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, which is kind of strange.  So maybe someone could let us know what Brian's up to because we miss him.  He came up with some great bits for us.  Oh, yeah.  The sounds of a crane.  The sounds of cranes.  All right, we got lots of faxes here.  Steve writes, can you ask Stephen Lynch if it's okay for me to record a heavy metal version of Kill a Kitten?  Please comment.  I just picked up a multi-track recorder to start pounding out hits, and I think that would sell a few hundred thousand.  Thanks.  I think Stephen would be flattered if there was a heavy metal version of Kill a Kitten out there. 
[00:06:30]  Obviously, you have to check with Stephen.  No.  Just go ahead and do it?  Yeah, go ahead, record it, send it in.  And we'll play it for Stephen?  And we'll play it for Stephen.  Okay.  Definitely.  We encourage all the bands that listen to the Opie and Anthony show to send in their ditties.  We're still looking for more songs for our Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Right.  And so far, we've had a few come in, but nothing worth playing on the air yet.  So keep those flying in, okay?  Also, we're getting a fax from Christine.  Stop teasing me and divulge the Dave Matthews info, please. 
[00:07:00]  Well, we don't have all the info yet, but we do know that Dave Matthews is coming in with Tim Reynolds this coming Tuesday,  and they're going to play on Ralph the Torres' show.  Yeah.  That's all we know at this point.  We don't know what time or anything like that.  And we're also going to get some listeners down here to check it out.  That's huge.  I don't remember Dave Matthews ever coming to a radio station to play live,  so that's going to be something to look forward to as well.  And speaking of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, Anthony? 
[00:07:30]  Yes.  I mean, we love when the listeners get involved with our show.  There's a guy, Gary.  Gary writes on the Instant Feedback,  Hey, guys, great show.  My wife said she would make me a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club  if I would design and host a website for the club.  Ooh.  I said, what the hell?  The whole site will be up on the net tomorrow.  We have a member picture area, chat links, and a message board.  A lot of work for a Hummer, but I've worked for less.  Stay tuned for the site's grand opening.  I'll email you the preview URL tomorrow. 
[00:08:00]  We have parked the domain name hummerclub.com,  and that's Gary, a new member of the club.  Wow.  We'll have to pop a link up.  Yes.  If it's good, we'll definitely pop a link through the WNEW website.  And we do not frown upon people making websites.  Yes.  There's a bunch of websites dedicated to Opie and Anthony.  I used to be quite the little webmaster myself, Opie, but kind of steered away from that. 
[00:08:30]  Mm-hmm.  Got a lot more to worry about here at WNEW than having fun and making websites.  We'll get back to doing that.  We used to have an unbelievable underground website.  Oh, my God, the smut that went on this thing.  It was great stuff.  And we'll get it up and running eventually.  Yes.  We're still trying to figure all this out.  We need more listeners, and then we'll start expanding our little empire.  Figure out what you people like, and then put it on the web.  But if you are interested, a lot of our old bits are on,  God, what is the name of the website?  Opac.com, I think. 
[00:09:00]  Is that it?  O-P-A-C-K.com, I believe.  There's a lot of old stuff.  Good.  And I've heard from a few of the listeners down here in New York  that they're starting up some new websites dedicated to us, which is very flattering.  We like that.  Yes, we do.  We encourage that stuff.  We encourage you guys to get involved with our show.  Yes.  All right.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, Rolling Stones.  She's so cold.  It's Opie and Anthony.  And boy, Anthony, a tiger was killed in Jersey last night.  Really? 
[00:09:30]  I didn't see that story on any news or hear it on the radio.  Yeah, no one is really talking about it,  so maybe we should spend a few minutes talking about the tiger that was killed in Jersey overnight.  Everyone's talking about that.  Enough about the stupid tiger, okay?  They killed a kitten.  Yeah.  See?  The cops.  Yeah, the cops killed a kitten.  And the song we play, Kill the Kitten, is just, you know, for fun.  I guess they had to.  They shot it at 930 after tranquilizer darts.  Failed to fill the animal. 
[00:10:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  They should have sent Patrick Ewing out there.  What are you...  What?  What are you saying?  Well, I'm not saying anything.  Why would Patrick Ewing come in handy to catch a tiger?  He just likes tigers, I heard.  Really?  I'm hearing a lot about Patrick Ewing lately.  That's all I'm trying to say.  That's all.  You want to elaborate on that at all?  No.  No?  No, I think you could finish the thought in your own head.  Why didn't you say what you said when the mics were off? 
[00:10:30]  What, about a spear and a loincloth?  What?  Yeah.  What?  Oh, Opie, you're so, so confused.  I didn't put the thought process together.  It was fragmented.  If you're trying to somehow say that Patrick Ewing looks like he belongs in a loincloth in Africa...  I didn't say that.  Well, I think that's what you're saying, that he should be hunting tigers. 
[00:11:00]  I did not say that.  I said they should send Patrick Ewing out to Jersey to kill the tiger last night.  Not to kill the tiger, to check it out.  You're severely mistaken.  It's a Siberian tiger, Opie.  Oh.  It has nothing to do with the African tigers.  Tigers, yes.  Actually, I don't even think there are tigers in Africa.  So my joke isn't even accurate.  Well, you're the one who said that Patrick Ewing looks like Shaka Zulu.  Well, he does. 
[00:11:30]  He just looks like the guy that played Shaka Zulu on the miniseries.  What's that?  That's very funny, that's all.  You're sure not playing basketball right.  No?  Wait, are you paying attention to basketball?  No, not at all.  I said I wouldn't pay attention.  You said you weren't going to watch one game.  I didn't watch.  Because you were so pissed.  I did not watch.  I just read about it.  Then how do you know?  I just read about it a little bit in the paper today. 
[00:12:00]  You watched.  I swear I didn't watch.  But I am like a crack ass.  Are you freaking out?  I'm really trying not to pay attention, but I'm slowly getting sucked back in.  You just play PlayStation.  Is it true that Sprewell scored 27 points last night?  Is that what I'm reading?  Let me look at the paper.  Yes.  The 12, 27 points.  I said I wouldn't follow the season.  How about that?  He didn't choke. 
[00:12:30]  Very good.  Hi, N-E-W.  8-9-9-3.  N-E-W.  You're on the air.  You're on the air.  8-9-9-3.  Hello?  Hi, I'm here.  Hi, what's up?  Who's this?  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, I just wanted to tell you guys.  You guys are talking about Patrick Ewing?  Yeah.  He's from Jamaica.  Yeah, I know.  But what are you guys saying?  He's from the Great African Plains.  Well, we didn't.  Anthony said that he looks like Shaka Zulu.  I thought he was from the Serengeti. 
[00:13:00]  Who is Shaka Zulu?  You never saw the miniseries on Channel 5, like, years ago?  Oh, I remember that.  Oh, I remember that.  Shaka Zulu.  Hey, you kind of look like Shaka Zulu, that's all.  Yeah, but, see, I've been a Knicks fan since I was a kid.  I love them guys.  You know, no matter what they do, I still love them.  And you're watching.  What?  Did you watch the game last night?  Yeah.  Oh, tell me about it.  Sprewell won a little ballistic in the third quarter, which I found was amazing.  I think you've got to give him a chance, you know?  Did he score 17 points, like the paper said? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, he did.  In the third quarter?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a big Knicks fan.  I was, I was, I was brought up, I was brought up as the oldest, um, I got two younger brothers,  but I was, like, with daddy's little girl, and I sat watching the games with him.  Yeah.  In the 70s, when they were, uh, the greatest.  Well, my dad turned me on to hoops.  I, I, I would be up in bed as just a little tyke, and I would, I would hear, uh, Dave the  Butcher.  Yeah.  But I always thought his name was Dave the Butcher.  It's like, wow, Dave.  Touching.  Dave the Butcher is scoring a lot of points tonight.  Yeah.  Well, that was it, eh?  That was it when you grew up in New York. 
[00:14:00]  Well, this is wonderful, Mikey.  Uh, the Charles Smedel, in his niche debut last night, scoring 27 points.  Fantastic.  I'm a fan.  Gotta give him a lot of credit.  Give him a lot of credit.  He comes into the garden, uh, with a lot of people skeptical of his abilities.  You guys are shocked at hell, but it's great.  It's classic.  You guys are, um, bringing a lot of, a lot of fun to any W, I'm telling you.  Hey, thank you very much.  All right.  I'll let you go.  Hey, who was your, who was your favorite Knick player back then in the 70s?  Um, probably Clyde Frazier.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, definitely. 
[00:14:30]  I used to think he was so cool.  Like, I loved the, like, the Rolls Royce and the funky clothes, you know?  Yeah, he was happening.  Little kid growing up in Jersey, you're like, wow, this is cool.  I liked, uh, Earl Monroe myself.  Oh, yeah, he's cool, too.  Earl of Pearl was great.  Back when the basketball players used to dress like pimps instead of gangsters.  No, like in the 70s, they would dress like Huggy Bear.  Oh, some of them still do.  I mean, and Rodman, he dresses like prostitute.  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.  Frazier had it going on, though.  Yeah, he still does.  If you ever check him out, like, because he's a, he's a, you know, the color commentator. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, I know, I know all that.  Yeah.  He dressed like he was working, uh, the girls after the game.  He was amazing.  Working my hoes.  Working my hoes.  Yeah, maybe we should hook him up with Rodman.  There you go.  All right.  Where do you think Rodman's going to land?  Well, I wanted him so bad to come to New York, but they're not interested, you know?  No, he's going to have a, he's going to, he's going to be a major problem to whatever team picks him up.  They were talking about it on the radio this morning.  They were saying, um, Rodman in his, um, in his bridal gown with Pat Riley in his Armani suit. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  It looks like he's going to Miami, but I think he's just going to be nothing but trouble for Miami.  Yeah.  You watch.  Yeah.  His days of, uh, truly behaving are, are long gone.  Well, he says he wants to streak, and he's definitely going to do it before his career ends.  Yeah.  But make it across some kind of court.  So it's going to be classic.  All right.  Well, thank you.  Guys, keep rocking, all right?  We will.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Look at that.  The fabulous sports, babe. 
[00:16:00]  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, it's just a fan.  All right.  How you doing?  What's up, guys?  Well, we're discussing the 12 Spirals debut with the Knicks last night.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Listen, but you guys are going to lay off Shaka Zulu, man, because with him and mighty Joe  Young, Larry Johnson, how does that other guy from Chicago, he's playing golf now?  He might actually be able to win a title now.  Well, yeah.  Oh, my gosh.  It's going to be a tainted title.  Whoever wins this year is going to be that big, stupid asterisk.  Yeah, but what are you going to do?  Come on.  The big Roger Marish asterisk. 
[00:16:30]  It beats nothing.  You know?  It beats nothing.  When the Devils run a strike short and she's, and I'm a Ranger fan, and, you know, what are  you going to do?  It's still a title.  Yeah, I guess.  It's a title.  Read the guy alone.  Give a break, huh?  And then, you know, mighty Joe Young there?  What's up, Larry Johnson?  Well, Ewing just sucks.  Yeah.  He sucks.  Well.  Instead of negotiating, he should have tried to, you know, keep in shape.  Yeah, but at least we got a score.  We got a scorer now with Spree.  Well, hopefully we'll be, well, you know. 
[00:17:00]  But what are you going to do?  You got to give him a lot of credit, Mikey.  Guys, it's Ray.  How you doing?  All right?  Yeah, we're doing all right, man.  Good, man.  We've taken some heavy hits lately, but we're hanging in there.  All right.  I'm hanging in there, guys.  All right, man.  What are you going to do?  Happy smiling faces here at N.E.W.  That's right.  There you go.  A lot of love in the N.E.W. studio.  Hey, where's the nice man?  What's he think about Ewing?  I don't know.  He's not in yet.  No, he hasn't come in.  All right.  Tell him I said hi.  All right.  See you.  Hi, N.E.W.  N.E.W. 
[00:17:30]  Hey, guys.  Speaking of Patrick Ewing, I was in a movie theater the other day, and they showed the Mighty  Joe Young trailer.  Some guy just shouted out, Patrick Ewing, in the middle of theater.  And, of course, the theater I was in was about half black.  So they pretty much started a riot.  Couldn't start the movie.  But definitely, the parallels are there.  Race relations are still horrible, man.  I don't care how many organizations parade around that there's all this diversity and  everything.  It's really bad.  I mean, it just really is. 
[00:18:00]  It is.  I thought it was kind of funny, but, you know, I can see people getting upset about it.  You know, I laugh, but it was definitely heated.  I really didn't want to be in that movie theater.  I can imagine.  Did anyone pop some caps in the screen?  No, no.  I was waiting for that.  Pop some caps in the screen.  I was waiting for that, but it didn't happen.  I was just kind of cowering under my seat waiting for, you know, the debris to start  flying.  All right, man.  All right.  Take care, guys.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  My goodness.  Man.  Things are just bad out there. 
[00:18:30]  I don't know.  I just want to state that we didn't say anything.  It was our listeners that time.  That time.  All right.  A little message to the faithful listeners.  We have reached our quota on Patrick Ewing jokes.  So if you're using the instant feedback, can you back off on that a little bit?  We got hundreds of them, Anthony.  I know.  Absolutely hundreds of them.  Warning.  Warning.  Warning.  We've reached our quota.  We've reached our quota.  Abuse someone else.  Warning. 
[00:19:00]  Warning.  Warning.  Warning.  1027 WNAW, the rock of New York.  That's the ladies from Creed.  My Own Prison is the name of the CD, and that's another track called One.  These guys are just really, really on fire, selling so many copies of that CD.  A little band from Florida making good.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You got an interesting story over there, Anthony, on the Internet?  Yeah, it just goes to show you how hair-trigger people are in the matter of race we were discussing earlier.  And it seems in Washington, the chairman of the NAACP says Washington Mayor Anthony Williams acted in a niggardly way 
[00:19:30]  by accepting the resignation of an aide who offended some people by using that word in a conversation.  And people are all upset because this guy, an aide for the mayor, used the word niggardly in front of some people he was speaking to,  and then he resigned.  David Howard stepped down.  He had to resign because he used that word.  He had to resign, and the mayor now is getting flack for accepting his resignation. 
[00:20:00]  David Howard, who said the word niggardly, is a white guy.  And he said it, and people got upset, saying it's a slur.  But it turns out it's not.  It means grudgingly mean about spending or granting.  It just sounds close to a slur.  So it's stingy.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty much what it means, being stingy.  It's in all the dictionaries, and it's not even in the American Dictionary of Forbidden Language, 
[00:20:30]  which shows slurs and bad words.  And a lot of people are upset about this, including the head of the NAACP, who says that people act with a hair trigger now.  And words that, obviously this sounds like a slur, but it's not.  And the guy lost his job over that.  Yeah, he had to resign.  And niggardly means stingy.  Niggardly. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  I'll use it in a sentence.  Okay.  Okay.  The bosses here are niggardly with our promotion money.  How about that?  That's pretty good.  Okay.  And with our paychecks.  Oh, with our paychecks.  Hmm.  It seems of late, the people have been a little niggardly with our ratings.  You know, I got an interesting story about the N-word.  Why?  Got to tell it.  It just shows how naive I was when I was younger. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  When you were younger.  Well, come on.  Give me a break.  All right.  But growing up, as you probably know by now, basketball was my first love.  Grew up playing it since I was five years old.  Mm-hmm.  Blah, blah, blah.  Went to all the basketball camps.  Tried out for the high school team and the junior high team.  All that stuff.  Right.  All right.  And I played with, obviously, a lot of black guys.  Right.  Okay?  That's just how it was.  I went to camp with them.  They became my friends. 
[00:22:00]  Had them over my house.  I mean, I had a lot of black friends growing up because I played hoops.  Right.  All right.  Now, we're in the gym one day.  We're playing a pickup game.  I was 15.  And the black guys to each other, like, nice shot, nigga.  You know, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga.  Wow, nice shot, nigga.  Right?  Mm-hmm.  So I'm figuring at this point that I'm like one of the guys.  Oh, no.  One of the guys.  I'm, you know, 15 now.  I've been hanging with these guys for years.  I've heard them, you know, toss the word around a bunch of times, you know. 
[00:22:30]  The white shadow.  And they throw it around in a fun-loving way, you know.  Right.  Very affectionate.  Man, nigga, you blocked that shot.  Way to go.  Right?  Right.  So my buddy, Gary, who is a very good friend of mine.  Very good.  Mm-hmm.  He makes a good shot.  So I just go, nice shot, nigga.  Dude, I couldn't even get the whole word out.  I was knocked out cold on the floor of the gym looking up at the ceiling wondering what  the hell just happened. 
[00:23:00]  That is a true story.  What are you, crazy?  I got a chipped tooth from it.  Look at you.  Right here.  That's from that.  I'm like, what the heck?  Like the whitest guy around and you're throwing out nigga?  Yeah.  What the heck happened?  I thought we were all just friends here.  That is taboo.  I was so naive.  I learned that, you know, like a black guy can say nigga to another black guy, but if  a white guy says it, you know, there's going to be trouble.  So did you make up and everything?  Like, honestly, yeah, but our relationship just wasn't the same after that. 
[00:23:30]  You started calling me cracker-ass cracker.  Right.  Well, I didn't know.  Oh.  I saw them throwing the word around and I'm like, you know, I've been hanging with these  guys for a while and I wanted to get a little closer.  That's tragic.  Not kidding, man.  He turned around and belted me so hard.  I didn't even get the full word out.  I was out cold looking up at the ceiling.  Wow.  Going, holy mackerel.  What happened?  A learning experience there.  That was a major learning experience. 
[00:24:00]  Major.  So I'll share with you today.  Very good.  So I don't use that word anymore.  You can't use that, but I guess you can use niggardly.  Niggardly.  Yes.  That's the word of the day, I guess, Anthony, on our radio show.  You were very niggardly with your understanding of the word nigga.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Stingy?  Yeah, I guess that sort of works.  I'm still not brave to use that word.  Well, I wouldn't use it.  I try to learn a new word every day.  I think I'm going to keep that one out of my vocabulary. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, that's probably one you should steer clear of.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah, try using that right now if you're listening to us.  Good luck.  Good luck.  Let us know what happens.  Depends on where you are.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  Lots more show to go today.  We've got Louis Black coming in from The Daily Show and Comedy Central.  He's a friend of the show.  He's been in a bunch, and he never fails to entertain everyone.  Yes.  And also, we've got to qualify another person to have that Super Bowl party in your house.  Later this hour, when you hear the new one from Collective Soul, that song Heavy, 
[00:25:00]  be the 10th caller to win a $50 multi-sport passport to Chelsea Piers  and qualify to have a Super Bowl party thrown at your house.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNW, the latest from Collective Soul off their CD dosage.  That's Heavy.  And that was the song you had to be listening for to qualify to have that Super Bowl party  thrown at your house.  And I think Rick just put them on hold.  Line 5's the winner.  Let's see what they're all about.  All right.  Hi, NW.  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[00:25:30]  What's up?  Congratulations.  No, thank you.  I deserve every bit of accolade.  It's not an easy thing.  They're not winning all this stuff here.  It's really not that easy.  You know you won the $50 multi-sport passport to Chelsea Piers.  That's right.  And now you're qualified to have a Super Bowl party thrown at your house.  I have a funny feeling of seeing you guys on Sunday.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Where do you live?  You know what?  You don't even have to bring no beer.  I got that covered.  Well, you're not a serial killer or anything.  Uh, no, no.  Not unless I'm incited.  You're not a drug dealer? 
[00:26:00]  No.  Yeah, we do.  But they're easy enough to get as you guys need.  You're not gay, are you?  Oh, please.  Yeah, that'd be a funny scenario, too.  You go over, hi, it's the Super Bowl party.  Put on the music.  Good gracious.  I'll be, Anthony.  You want to dance?  We're up for a little new twist or something before the game.  Now, don't worry.  I'll be serving beer.  I'm not going to be serving champagne or Shirley Temple or anything like that.  This is just a bizarre situation we got ourselves in once again. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, yeah.  What are you guys going to do if it's like at a nursing home or something?  You got a bunch of oldies or...  Oh, you know what?  We wish we could pick the winner because there's one girl that won.  And she's going to have the Super Bowl party in her dorm room with like five of her sorority sisters.  Oh.  And we're like, oh, why can't we just pick this one?  Oh, we go to that one.  You know what's going to happen?  It's like right now I live in Queens.  But if I happen to win, if it's okay with you, I'll swing it right behind your neck of the woods.  I'll go right off to Long Island.  There you go.  We'll take over my parents' house.  We'll have two floors.  Hey, what part of Queens? 
[00:27:00]  The backyard.  What part of Queens?  Actually, right now I'm in Long Island City.  All right, cool.  But I got a basement apartment, so there ain't much of a party going on there.  Yeah.  I just moved in a few months ago.  It's too early to be kicked out.  Hey, have you seen that guy that sues everybody in Queens?  Let me tell you something.  I wish he would try to sue me.  I'll turn it right back on him.  Yeah.  Yeah, that guy's ridiculous.  What's up with that?  Has he tried to sue you guys?  That's what someone said in a fax that said, obviously, the guy doesn't listen to your  show, or he would sue you guys as well.  You know, the problem with most of the people out in Queens, I've noticed, they won't wait  to sue you.  They'll just pop you one in the head if you do something to get them mad. 
[00:27:30]  Nothing wrong with that.  The guy gets mad because the spinach sale is over.  A little street justice.  I like that.  Nothing wrong with street justice, brother.  All right, man.  Hey, I hope I win it.  Hey, you guys are doing a great job.  Thank you.  I'm from Long Island, and hey, I hope to talk to you, man.  All right, good luck.  Good luck, man.  Hold on the line.  I think we're getting more info from you.  I'll take, give as much info as you want.  Hey, one question, O.  Yeah.  Do you guys get to pick, if there was two winners, you guys get to pick who gets what?  Does Mason get one?  You get one?  You guys get what you want? 
[00:28:00]  I don't know how they're working it.  I think we're both just going to reach our hands into a hat and pick out a winner.  You guys can always rumble for, you know, the one that you want, but do what you  can.  All right, man.  Thanks a lot, O.  Hold on the line.  See ya.  Oh, look at this famous person coming into the studio.  We're on the way for this guy.  Louis Black has entered the studio.  What's up, man?  Hey, Louis.  Hi, good to see you.  He's getting more and more famous every time we see him.  I know.  Oh, boy.  Soon he won't be in here at all. 
[00:28:30]  No.  Won't come and see us anymore.  Well, we'll let him put his coat down.  Hold on, hold on, Louis.  It's in the middle of telling us a great story.  Priceline.com, Anthony.  Oh, Priceline.  Yeah, one of our sponsors on our show.  We love Priceline.com.  I can't get enough of Priceline.  It's an amazing service.  Hi, I'm Bill Shatner.  Yeah, you're the spokesperson for Priceline.com.  I love Priceline.  Even on our computers on the Enterprise, I still use Priceline. 
[00:29:00]  Yes.  Watch.  Computer.  Working.  Get me Priceline.com.  Priceline.  Name your own price for a hotel room.  That's right.  It's Priceline.  You sure that's not the evil Kirk, though?  No, the evil Kirk is stupid.  He doesn't even like or use Priceline.  Yeah.  He's a moron.  Okay.  Of course, you can tell he's the evil Kirk because he's got the goatee. 
[00:29:30]  The universal sign of the evil twit.  Yes, of course.  All right.  So, Priceline.com.  They got this hotel room thing happening.  If you're going away in the near future, you need some hotel rooms, give Priceline.com a try.  1-800-Priceline.  Or visit them on the web, www.priceline.com.  And you name your own price for a hotel room in Priceline.  Hookshop.  It's that easy.  They set me up when I was on Triacus.  Triacus?  Yes, I only wanted to pay 500 quatlus for a room. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  And they came back with a price of 300 quatlus.  Not going to lose, I got a double.  One for me, one for Spock.  And if you use their service, they're going to give you a free hotel night.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  Kenny Wayne Shepard, blue on black.  It's Opie, it's Anthony, and it's our good friend, Louis Black.  From Comedy Central, officially, I guess.  I guess.  And Caroline's, too.  I'm representing them. 
[00:30:30]  And the NBA.  I'm representing them.  I'm representing them all.  You're playing Caroline's tonight.  I'm playing Caroline's tonight.  And the way things are going, I may be playing for the Sacramento Kings.  One or the other.  I'm not sure which.  Well, I'm a huge basketball fan, but I've sworn off to season.  Have you really?  Good for you.  Yeah.  He's protesting, yeah.  But I'm like a crack addict, though.  I'm looking at the paper going, oh, Sprewell, he scored 27 points last night.  Oh, I'm dying.  So are you a Celtic fan coming from there?  No, no.  We're from New York original. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, that's right.  No, heavy Knicks fans.  Oh, yeah.  Heavy, heavy, heavy.  Well, yeah.  Good move, too, to pick up Sprewell.  Yeah.  We had to make believe.  Yeah, huh?  We had to make believe up there, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah, go Celts.  Yeah.  Pats.  Yeah, Blensoe.  Kick ass.  Love them socks.  Yeah, Moe.  Woo!  But this Sprewell thing, I just thought that was more than I could bear.  I just thought it's too much for me to bear.  I'm sorry, you know.  Really?  For a guy, for myself.  Look, I can understand if you're a kid, you know, if you're 15 and you can't play basketball 
[00:31:30]  like I couldn't, you're just good enough to not make the team.  Just good enough so that it's frustrating and out.  Just good enough so you're kind of like falling, you know, oh, yeah, this is the layup  that'll get me in.  And you'll hurt yourself, okay?  Then I can understand when the coach is screaming at you, you want to take a punch and kill him,  okay?  Because he's, come on, look at you, you son of a bitch, move your ass.  Okay, then I can see, but a guy who's making a gazillion dollars, who cares?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  You know what?  They could put, you know, what's his name? 
[00:32:00]  Carlos Mokura put a poker up my butt.  Red hot poker.  Oh, no, whoa, we're going to have to put a poker up your butt and put you on a barbecue  grill.  Great, great, coach.  Just give me another million five.  I mean, what are you guys thinking?  I got angry.  Yeah.  And then he doesn't apologize.  How can he possibly get angry?  And then he doesn't change his hairstyle.  Does anything end?  When you go to court, you have to change your hairstyle.  That's true.  You do.  You got to fill in those wherever between those shows.  You know, put in, you know, seed it. 
[00:32:30]  Seed it.  Isn't that funny when the people go to court and you see him walk in, the suit and the  nice hair.  Exactly.  And the shot of him after the arrest is the big, long hair, straggly looking.  It's like, well, it's done him well being in lockup.  You know, he's got his lawyer, his fashion consultant.  He's looking good.  Ah.  Very nice.  Well, we're going to talk about Evel Knievel here.  Oh, yeah.  Our buddy, our pal.  This is a joke.  The legend. 
[00:33:00]  Evel Knievel got a new liver.  Got his liver.  He was so close to death.  They were counting down.  He had less than a couple months to live.  And he got his liver.  And he's pleading like, please, I need a liver.  I don't want to die.  The guy's jumping over trucks his whole life, drinking like a fish.  He's drinking like a dock worker.  And he's falling off, jumping over the fountains and sees his palace.  He looks like a rag doll, flapping around.  And now he's, I don't want to die.  Well, they should have just given him a cycle and told him to leap over the river Styx. 
[00:33:30]  Yes.  That's him.  That's unbelievable.  Well, the thing that was difficult, the reason that it was so hard to find a liver for him  is because of the amount of pounding his stomach took.  His liver was actually at his shoulder.  They couldn't find it.  They couldn't find it.  We should have had him jump like 20 ambulances before we gave him a liver.  One last one, Evel.  One last one, Evel.  You want the liver that's on the other side.  Really, in order to pay the rev.  Don't you think the liver should go to maybe the budding young scientist 
[00:34:00]  that might come up with a cure for AIDS or something, a cure for cancer,  instead of a drunk that jumped stuff on his motorcycle?  Unbelievable.  Well, if you're a celebrity, you get a liver in this country.  Simple as that.  That's true.  Look at the Mick, Mickey Mantle.  He got his new liver, died two months later.  Yeah.  Really?  Oh, man.  Where do you think that old liver is?  I know his old liver will turn up on that damn channel where they sell stuff.  Sports memorabilia.  Ebay.com.  Here it is. 
[00:34:30]  Here's the Mick's liver.  There's only 100 pieces.  These are guaranteed to draw at least $300 next time they come around.  And we'll give you a free McBeanie baby with it.  You know the Mick's liver's got to be out there somewhere.  Someone's having a lot of fun at a party somewhere.  What did you guys think of that?  Well, this country's lost its mind.  $2.6 million for that.  For the ball.  For the ball.  Yeah, there's something.  There's something that's good.  You know, you can't get a wing of a hospital you can build without you. 
[00:35:00]  Let's pray for the ball.  I want all the kids in America to see the ball.  Show them any ball.  Show them made up ball.  What kind of jackass country do we live in?  Who can we believe in?  Santa Claus.  Did you send a ball to every school?  Yeah, that's the ball.  You know, tell everybody they got the ball.  Who cares?  Meanwhile, people are, you know, flipping up.  And then we can at least, we can clone livers at this point.  But the money would dump it into the crowd.  Think of that.  Yeah.  Think of what you can get with $3 million. 
[00:35:30]  Exactly.  Yes.  It's like, hmm.  Yeah.  A ball.  That's funny.  $3 million.  Now, Lewis, do you have any comments on the Pope?  Oh, the Pope?  I love the Pope.  We all love the Pope.  He's looking great.  Oh, quasi-popo.  Oh, man.  I want whatever they're giving him to keep him going, I want.  Yeah.  Because I have a tendency to nap in the afternoon, and I think it can get me through it.  He's unbelievable.  Robo-Pope.  In the Pope-sicle and all that stuff, you know?  Hunchback of Pope-sher-dame.  You see how he looks? 
[00:36:00]  His head is now where his belly is.  I never knew you could get your head that forward and down.  His shoulders are up, and he moves like does Disney animatronics.  Wait a minute.  Here we go.  Hello.  I am the Pope.  Through Disney's animatronics, sit back and watch the Pope.  He had on the Daily Show the other night, Stuart said that John was telling him before  he made his speech in St. Louis, he had this thing where they superimposed John whispering 
[00:36:30]  into the Pope's ear going, you know, and he says, and you know, for this advice, you  know, let me just say, you know, if you could just tell your people not to kill any more  of my people, he's like, I'm sitting here going, wow, we have lost our minds.  That's harsh.  We like that.  And the best is, and you see Clinton with him, and you just go, you know, I don't, this  is why I don't need drugs anymore.  What you need is a photo of the two of them together or see them live, and you just go,  what are they both thinking? 
[00:37:00]  You know, what is going on?  What is left unsaid?  That's what I want to hear.  You know, it's that the Pope's is a flat line.  You know it's going through the Pope's head.  You know it's going through.  Oh, here he is, Mr. Cigar Man, this is him.  Oh, boy.  All right, let's take a break here.  We have a lot more to discuss, a lot more current events.  If you want to talk to Louis Black or us, that'd be cool.  Yeah, call up, yell, whine.  Yeah, please, don't call up with some sort of cranky, the Pope stuff disturbed me, okay? 
[00:37:30]  I can guarantee you, the three of us here are making no difference.  Well, earlier in the show, we got in trouble for our Kill a Kitten song.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, because that's what's going to happen.  Because a hundred kids will go out and do that.  Yeah, an animal hospital called up and said that playing a song will probably maybe get people to kill animals.  You know, like they're fine, upstanding people.  They hear this song and go, and like start killing things.  Yeah, it's us that did it. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, we're the reason.  Yeah, they say that we're giving them ideas.  There's a line in the song, you know, feed your kitten cocaine.  Yeah, there's going to be a lot of people trying that tonight.  Yeah, they'll be wandering down.  Wandering down my block, 43rd, looking for score.  The Rock of New York, 1027, WNEW, Bad Company, Rock and Roll Fantasy, ACDC before that, TNT.  It's Opie, it's Anthony, and it's Louis Black from Comedy Central, The Daily Show.  And you're playing Caroline Sunday, right?  Yeah, Caroline Sunday, 8 o'clock.  Got to get that plug in for you, Louis.  Yeah, thank you.  I'm very slow on those. 
[00:38:30]  My self-promotion is, you know, whew.  Yeah, that's it.  We like guys like you, though.  You don't come in just to plug.  No.  I even forget what it is I'm doing.  We get some comedians in here, and all they want to do is plug their gig.  It's like, shut up and try to be funny.  Hey, can I plug a gig?  Huh?  I'm going to be at, uh, what, Governor's, I guess, huh, in March sometime?  Yeah, Dice.  Check it out, huh?  Yeah.  I got new rhymes.  You got new rhymes?  Yeah, yeah.  All right, can we hear one on our show tonight?  Hickory dickory duck, it is Chigaggy! 
[00:39:00]  Come on, this is funny stuff here, huh?  I'm going to be a laugh your balls off in Poughkeepsie.  I had a full-scale fight with him on the radio.  Did you really?  Andrew Dice Clay.  Dice.  The Diceman called up while I was, it was my segment.  It was when Darian O'Toole was here, right?  And they brought me on.  It was like one of the few times I was getting any air for this off-Broadway show I had.  And it's like 8 in the morning, for crying out loud.  And I'm there, and I, you know, I'd done the show the night before, and I'm sitting there,  and then Dice comes out.  He's not supposed to be on the show. 
[00:39:30]  He's going, you know, a little, you know, who's Louis Black?  Who is that?  I never heard of Louis.  Where did you perform?  And I said, the same dump you perform in, jackass.  And then it just took off.  And then he's going to use, is Darian nice?  Would you like to, would you think I'd like to poker?  I said, stop it.  I said, what do you think?  Is this like some sort of a gay thing you're doing?  If I want to poker, you're going to want to poker, you fruit.  I was just, you know.  It was horrible.  It was just horrible.  Talk about creepy. 
[00:40:00]  Well, we went out to LA for the Grammys a couple years back, and Anthony interviewed Andrew Dice Clay as Andrew Dice Clay.  Oh, I was pissing him off.  Hey, this guy's got an identity process here.  What's he doing, huh?  And he's wearing this big floppy hat.  I go, hey, how far did you chase Spanky for that hat?  Hey, what, you want to heckle-fy me?  I'll paint tits on your back, make you my bitch.  It went back and forth. 
[00:40:30]  Who's the evil dice?  Which one's it?  And I started ragging about his TV series.  Which one do we got here?  The nice cuddly dice?  Or is it the bad dice?  Andrew Clay, the dice man?  Shut up.  Who is this?  And it's all right.  I remember he had the TV show, and he had to be the nice dice.  He's on the TV shows.  Well, now I'm, you know, Andrew Clay.  I'm a nice guy now.  No more with the leather jacket.  I do a TV show on Fox.  And then two months later when it flopped, I'm the dice man. 
[00:41:00]  Hickory dickory bone gig.  He's such a hack.  We'll get him on the show.  Oh, yeah.  He's supposed to be in town.  He's going to be in town.  He's coming around.  I'm surprised he didn't call in while I'm sitting here.  Hey, who's this Louis Black?  How come I never heard of you?  Is it because you barely listen?  He doesn't listen to anybody.  You've heard no other voice since you were 14. 
[00:41:30]  Unbelievable.  Too good.  Too good.  What else is happening in the world we can discuss and make fun of?  Well, I was sitting there watching.  They could be, I'll tell you, I can't even, I try to watch the impeachment thing.  Let's get to a sentence, Louis.  I try to watch that impeachment thing.  I'm sitting today because you try to keep up.  And I realize I've gone deaf.  When any of them talk, I can't, when it says live from Washington, I can't hear anything.  And it proves what I've always thought, that you can only listen to so much crap. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  And that actually it's just like, if it is really crap, your ears fill up and then you  can't hear anything.  You need a stick to take it out.  It just doesn't matter anymore.  It's not.  I don't even care.  It's entertaining.  I can't even tune in for two seconds.  It's supposedly the most important thing, event in American history.  I can't watch it for a second.  Yeah, no, I'm just getting bored.  And then I also think the other reason it's so upsetting is, is now, now that I've argued  it from all sides, it does not matter what side you're on.  You're wrong.  I don't care what side you take. 
[00:42:30]  Either side you take, you're completely wrong and you're evil.  And you're a bad person.  If you're, I don't, it doesn't matter.  Clinton.  Oh, this guy's a winner.  Gee, is this guy something?  He's great.  Okay, he's great.  Well, there's another one.  But they've never called.  I don't, I've never been called.  No.  I was once called, though, it was good.  The only time I was called was for, for when I guess Dinkins was running against Giuliani.  Was that the deal?  Yeah.  And they, and they called to do a polling thing. 
[00:43:00]  And they, where did they call from?  Tennessee.  And then at the end of it, I said, would you tell whoever?  He's running this, oh, you know, that's why, what's wrong with it?  But, you know, they all suck.  I mean, they're in Tennessee.  At least they couldn't even get a polling service in our, in our city with nine million people.  They couldn't, you know, hire a couple of guys down the street to make the call.  Had to be Tennessee.  Had to be Tennessee.  All right.  I think we need to take a little break.  Let you calm down a little, Louis.  Yeah, I got to lie down.  All right.  If you got something to ask us about current events, give us a call. 
[00:43:30]  212-757-1027.  We'll go to the phones next.  We're hanging with Louis Black.  1027-WNEW, the rock of New York Nirvana.  Smells like teen spirit and the new band Indigenous before that.  Now that you're gone, it's Opie.  Indigenous.  Hmm.  They are American Indians, aren't they?  Yes, they are.  They're a family.  A couple brothers and a sister.  Hmm.  Their father was into Stevie Ray Vaughan.  God, I know too much about them.  That's sad.  Very good. 
[00:44:00]  Little musical tidbits from Opie.  You think people sit there in their car and go, care.  They're probably writing it down.  Right.  Oh, man.  Now I have something to say when I go to the bar tonight.  I have to go over and put in the quarters and wait for it to show up.  In the studio, Louis Black playing Caroline tonight.  And you can see him on The Daily Show every Wednesday.  Every Wednesday.  Is now going to be your spot.  I missed you last night.  I was so pissed.  I was flipping around the dial.  And all of a sudden, John Sterling goes, Louis Black, everyone.  That was really funny.  I'm like, damn, what did I miss?  Well, you missed it.  I gave The Secret of Life away. 
[00:44:30]  And I gave it away for nothing.  Oh, we missed it.  Can you help us out with that today?  No, it's tough.  They're paying me to give it away on TV.  You're going to have to sit around and watch cable for the rest of the weekend and catch it and rerun.  So how's the mood around there without Kilbourne on it?  They're happy.  Are they?  Yeah.  I mean, I hate to say it.  I mean, Craig was not your basic, you know, he's, you know, Craig didn't have those skills that many of us are born with. 
[00:45:00]  You know, he's coming.  A heart?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, the wizard looked in his bag and went, nothing's left.  Sorry.  I'm going to send you on your way with nothing.  But it's just weird.  You know, there are guys who can work in that.  You know, you guys know him.  You come in here and we get along and it's easy and it's fun, you know.  But Craig was always kind of like, all right, let's, if I move over here like at a 90 degree angle to you, will that work?  You know, it wasn't that severe, but it's close enough that it's actually true. 
[00:45:30]  Did him and Stuart get along?  Because I saw John Stuart on the show at one point.  And actually, I get along great with Craig.  But, you know, it's one of those things where I wasn't there every day working in the office environment.  And John is much more easygoing.  We've had him in here.  He's just a great guy.  He's a great guy.  You know, there's no, you know, there's certain guys within the business, it's tough.  I mean, this is a tough business to remain any kind of stability, you know, to have that at all.  And John's really got it. 
[00:46:00]  I mean, John's not worried about, you know, he's setting his, you know, he's got a great gig and he enjoys it and he feels comfortable.  You know, and Craig was the kind of guy, well, there was this gig and then we're going, well, there's a better one over here.  Right, right.  And he went for it.  And I think that's when things get went askew.  Once he went for that and Comedy Central said, well, you can't do that.  We got a contract with you.  And then that's when the things flipped out.  And a lot of the people in the, you know, who are working in the office, you know, became the brunt of that little battle. 
[00:46:30]  And now that he's gone, everybody's kind of like relaxing.  It's fun again.  It's really fun.  Cool.  You know.  Very cool.  Not for me.  Life is hell.  Don't get the illusion that you're having a good time.  For those people who don't think, yeah, it's fun.  But for someone like myself who ponders every moment, it's just brutal.  Did you ponder the tiger in Jersey?  Yeah.  Everyone else is talking about that today.  I think he's probably, it's probably somebody's wife.  And he just said, you know, I've had it with you. 
[00:47:00]  And she said, I had it with you.  One or the other.  And left.  And that's, you know, and people say, well, it's wrong to marry another species.  And I say, no, not anymore.  Not anymore.  There are a lot of people wandering around there alone and desperate.  And if a tiger works, I say, fine.  But I don't think you let the tiger out of the house.  That's something.  Or pull its teeth before it goes.  You know.  Where did it come from?  That's unbelievable.  They're still trying to figure that out.  They got that damn safari down there where you drive your car through and they tell you  don't roll the windows down.  Wow.  This is like, like really driving in Africa, isn't it? 
[00:47:30]  Look at that.  Red baboon mandrel ass against my windshield.  But no, it didn't come from that.  And then there's some woman that has permission to keep tigers.  And it didn't come from her.  And it didn't come from her.  Yeah.  So it must be indigenous to Jersey.  There you go.  The Elizabethan Siberian tiger.  You want to take some calls here?  Yeah.  All right.  We're talking about current events here with Lures Black.  Hi, Andy W.  Hey, what's up, man?  What's up?  Dude, talking about the earthquake.  What's the story of all those dead people? 
[00:48:00]  What's with all those dead people?  What do they do with them?  What do they do with them?  Yeah.  I mean, we just throw them back in the ground.  And with those poor people, I don't get it.  Yeah, you sound very sympathetic.  It's sick, is what it is.  It's pretty nuts.  Usually burial is what's done.  Yes.  That's what I heard.  I'm with you, but if everything's already buried, I don't know why they go digging them  up and all that.  Oh, that happens years later.  It's a lot of manpower, I think.  Like Pompeii.  They need, like, food, and they're worried about the dead. 
[00:48:30]  I don't get it.  A lot of disease, man.  Well, there is, you know, there are certain things brought along here.  I'm not a health expert by any means.  My apartment should be shut down.  But even I know when the dead are around there for a couple of days, it's time to get rid  of them.  Where do you go?  You got no infrastructure.  Well, that's something I don't know.  We got to solve that, right?  Let's get on that.  All right.  We'll work on that.  Thanks a lot, brothers.  Are you, like, just smoking pot right now?  No, man.  I'm just joking. 
[00:49:00]  You know what it's like.  All right.  All right.  I'll tell you, it makes you happy that you do live in America because we have the earthquakes  and a couple of hundred people die and everyone freaks out.  Oh, my God.  Did you realize that?  200 people dead.  When you realize in some countries where a mudslide wipes out 40,000 people, you start  thinking, like, wow, the occasional tornado through the trailer park isn't so bad.  Yeah, we're pretty lucky.  We are pretty lucky.  But also, these people choose to live in a line of fire.  You know, if you're in it, I've always said this, like, in Los Angeles, if you live in  a place where the earth, you know, where you have earthquakes, I think the earth's telling 
[00:49:30]  you to move.  Right.  I'm getting ready to chip off here.  I mean, why would you stay?  I mean, this is not, these are places where these things happen.  It's the same thing.  I won't live in the mid, I won't live in those places where they're...  Cornedias?  No.  Not those flat things.  You look in, because basically, you wake up in one morning, you look in one direction,  and you go, boy, it's really nice.  You turn around and go, holy shit!  You know, you've got to, you know, there's no telling at any given moment.  And then I love, have you ever been, when I've toured, you know, I've been in Tulsa, 
[00:50:00]  and there was like a tornado warning, like, five hours before the show, and then it passed,  and I said, well, what kind of a warning is that?  Yeah.  What am I supposed to do, go to a root cellar?  You know?  I mean, where am I supposed to do?  They always go to the root cellar.  And I don't know where a root cellar is, I live in an urban area.  I don't know what these people are.  And when are you supposed to get in your car and run?  What are you supposed to do?  I like the people in the Midwest, too, because they're with the tornadoes,  and they look at us and go, I sure wouldn't live nowhere where there's them hurricanes. 
[00:50:30]  So you've got the hurricanes.  Oh, yeah, boy, you can't outrun those.  You can track them with a calendar.  You know, the thing, wow, how far did it move?  Wow, three feet in the past day?  How much time we got?  These tornadoes plop out of the sky, the finger of God flicking your little home away.  But no, I won't live in all of them hurricanes.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  Listen, I'm really kind of ticked off about these Canadians smuggling Viagra back across the body. 
[00:51:00]  You know, we got enough...  Who knew?  We got enough loops around here.  We don't need to be losing enough to that.  Are they doing this?  Yeah, they are.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  You know, I think we're guarding the wrong goddamn border,  because, you know, the Mexicans come up, they do jobs that Americans don't want to do.  Canadians come down, they got Peter Jennings, they did all the good jobs,  and now they got Viagra.  They're stealing our boners.  Absolutely.  American boners. 
[00:51:30]  You know.  All right.  That's good.  Yes, I think so, too.  Thank you.  Bye.  Do you stay awake at night thinking of this, or?  A little early history.  After I listen to you guys, I think a lot about a lot of things.  I remember in a club.  Oh, cool.  Hey, listen, what was really cool is that my wife and I were driving home from work one day,  and it was a Tuesday, and we were listening to your show, and I'm like,  and right in the car.  And it was a beautiful thing.  She made me a member of Midey Mo.  Awesome.  I don't know if Louis Black knows about our club.  Hey, listen, are you both members now or not? 
[00:52:00]  Has that been fixed yet or not?  Yeah, I'm finally a member.  I'm sorry, I remember.  We discussed that a few weeks back.  Because, I mean, there was a big controversy about being the president since...  Yeah, yeah.  Well, let Louis in on the club.  Why don't you explain it to him?  It's a wonderful club, Louis.  You should join.  And one of them is the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, and all you need to do is on a Tuesday  night, get a Hummer, and you're in.  Is that just on a Tuesday?  That's it.  Just on a Tuesday.  Not in a car.  No, this guy anywhere.  Got it in a car, though, while he was listening to us.  You got it in a car?  What if you're like a little bum-ski there, huh? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  This could be gagging, and if she dies, she dies.  You know what I'm going to do?  Oh, my God.  There we go.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Glad we could help.  It's a Tuesday.  Hi, N.E.W., because Tuesday's a boring night.  That's true.  N.E.W.  Hey, help me, Louis.  Hey.  Hey, it's Johnny.  Hey, I got one thing.  What am I?  What am I?  What about Anthony?  Hey, Anthony.  Money's man alive.  You forget about him?  He's going over there.  All right.  Hey, you know, talking about the Pope, you know how he drives around in that Pope-mobile?  Yeah.  Sporty. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, think about this.  You know, if it comes to a stop, if the driver hit, like, this button, and it started like  a wind tunnel, and it's like all these dollar bills started flying around.  It's like, okay.  The Pope's got 30 seconds to collect all his money and something under his rope around  his waist.  Oh, my God.  Hey, I got one more thing.  I know it.  What do you think of Carol Miller?  Uh-oh.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  There you go.  We were in, I was in a three-hour meeting.  Yeah, today.  We had a little meeting today. 
[00:53:30]  So, we'll move on.  Did you know about Gabe Ben?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's met Ben the Fag.  He's met Ben the Fag, yes.  Ben the Fag?  He knows everyone on our show.  Oh, boy.  All right, Johnny.  We got flying.  All right, buddy.  The whole cast of zany characters.  The Viagra thing, one of the, last week on the daily they had, this thing, they're making  a nasal spray, Viagra.  Right, right.  Because apparently, we can't get hard enough, fast enough.  It's like, oh, it's not easy.  Takes a half an hour. 
[00:54:00]  Son of a gun.  No.  I need it now.  If they're going, you know, because sometimes you have to wait around.  Well, for a call, yeah, boy, that's terrible, isn't it?  You know, like you shoot at your eyeball.  Yeah, like my zine, you're taking it.  It's unbelievable, you know?  Can't get it fast enough.  Can't get it fast enough.  And then meanwhile, the guy's like putting it together, and it looks like, it looks like  blow.  It looks like he's doing cocaine on the end.  Just sitting there, you know, you don't want anything to be lumpy.  Well, yeah, you're absolutely right.  Okay.  I'm thinking, this is really odd. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  You do need it fast, though, like that.  Because I remember when I was a kid in high school, having sex, and the girl would have  to use the contraceptive, like, thing that you put in there, and it would foam up, like  a fire extinguisher.  You know what it was?  But you had a...  You had a care oval?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, no, that one?  Yeah, I used to use that one.  It was like a football.  Yeah.  You used that?  I've never heard of anybody else who used it.  It's not true.  This is like a shocker.  I didn't think anybody used it, because you know what it did to me? 
[00:55:00]  It set, like, a thousand fire ants up my pee-pee ball.  I said, no wonder this stuff works.  Yeah, that was a form of birth control that didn't quite work very well.  It didn't work at all.  No, no.  Maybe it didn't bother you.  No, it did sting.  It did?  Well, shut up.  It did sting, yeah.  It was unbelievable.  I raced out and tried to put water down his little mouth.  I didn't know what to do to stop the pain.  Grab a glass of water.  It looked like one of those little bobbing birds. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, really.  Take the drink and come back up.  You get some water, boy.  Yeah, I used to use those.  Oh, man.  It really, it was...  And it hurt my ass.  And they never worked.  Oh, man.  Every time I think I'm nuts, I turn and look at you.  Now, those things are terrible. 
[00:56:00]  Like, all of a sudden, you're making love to your girl.  You look down, it looks like a rabid dog.  It was like a fizzy.  Yeah, like a fizzy.  Like an Alka-Seltz.  It was.  Wop, wop, fizz, fizz, wham, bam.  Thank you, man.  Yeah, it was.  I went up there long enough.  I said, wow, this stuff really works.  I don't want to see you again for another three weeks.  Oh, man, that was wonderful.  Wow.  That and every so of those IUDs that were, like, open. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  You ever have one of those?  You go, you know, I think you ought to see a doctor about this.  What?  I think you either have an IUD or a safety pin.  I mean, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, what the hell is this?  It looks like a mobile.  You're going to hang from this ceiling.  It was unbelievable.  Wow.  All right.  Oh, that hurt.  Oh, man.  That's funny stuff, though.  A little early birth control.  I had forgotten that in care of all.  They were still working on those things, I think, back then.  Do they even sell them anymore? 
[00:57:00]  Who knows?  I don't think they do.  No clue.  And then I was running pregnancy tests in my closet.  We used to have it.  Yeah, yeah.  No, for all the kids in school.  They had the EPT pregnancy test.  But they weren't like the fast ones.  You used to have to let those things sit for a few hours.  And a lot of the people, you know, they couldn't have it sitting in their closet and snooping  parents and stuff.  My mom, she didn't care.  So I used to buy a bunch of them.  And girls would come in with little urine samples.  Give it to me with like 20 bucks. 
[00:57:30]  I would go home, perform the test, come in and go, oh, you're negative.  Like Dr. Anthony.  But I will have to admit, take a pap smear.  I'd like to probe your case.  You did that in high school?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's my own little pregnancy test.  Some kids have the lemonade stand.  And you have the lemonade stand.  Ah, youth.  All right.  That's fabulous.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York. 
[00:58:00]  Pink Floyd from Momentary Lapse of Reason.  That's one slip.  I haven't played that one on the radio in a while.  You like Floyd, Louis?  Pink Floyd?  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  Louis Blackhanger.  Can I get some tickets?  I get tickets?  Oh, man.  You know, I just got distracted.  He showed me Cher's butt.  Cher's ass.  She's singing at the Super Bowl.  Yeah, well, that's great.  You know, there's a choice.  What?  Because, I guess, because Sonny died last year. 
[00:58:30]  There's a reason.  That's probably it.  That's probably it.  All of a sudden, she's popular again because he hits a tree.  Well, like, you know, why would they have, well, isn't there somebody, you know, don't  we have somebody in there, an opera singer?  Couldn't we bring on somebody with, like, a touch of class and put him in a big chicken  outfit and then let him sing it, you know?  You know, or, you know, I'd like to see us have her sing it and then let those Bengal  tigers go.  That would be true.  Have you seen those ads?  Whatever that ad is on ESPN where the guy, the guy has, it's the marching band. 
[00:59:00]  Outpost.  Yeah.  Outpost.  Outpost.  The guy has a marching band and he says, and now we're going to let the wolves go.  And it says underneath, you think this commercial's tasteless?  Call us.  Yeah, yeah.  And I just wish they would do that real.  That's the same one with the rats going through the hole.  Yeah.  Launched gerbils.  Launched out of a cannon.  Out of a cannon, yeah.  Just perfectly disgusting.  It's bouncing off a wall, you know.  And that's the kind of thing.  And then kids will start doing that. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, see?  Yeah, you know, they'll be coming, you know.  But Cher's singing.  Well, the Super Bowl, the great thing about Super Bowl is that halftime entertainment,  which is just like, you know.  It's like they, it's designed for drug addicts.  You know?  Oh, boy, I can't wait to see.  They can't watch the game, but they're like, halftime.  Yay!  Oh, here it is.  What are they going to dress up like this time?  What are they going to sing?  12 million Alvises.  Oh, I haven't even thought of that.  It's unbelievable.  It's insane.  And then with the laser show that half works and people holding up cards. 
[01:00:00]  And then these commercials.  Oh, I can't wait to see that commercial with the frogs again.  Oh, boy, that'll be great.  What kind of lunacy?  Four and a half hours, too.  Why don't we just have to, you know, we all should just lay down and have trucks run over us.  Back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.  The pregame is seven hours this year.  Seven hours.  It starts at 11 in the morning this year.  Yeah, actually, with a rectal exam of everybody.  We're going right up their poopers.  All of them. 
[01:00:30]  Every one.  A lot.  80 cameras.  Simultaneously, actually.  Until something is found.  It'll be great.  How can there be seven?  There's seven hours.  Seven straight hours, yes.  It's unbelievable.  They don't devote that much time to the inauguration.  You know what I mean?  That's something important.  You could do like an A&E biography on every player that's going to be in the game.  What could be the...  It just astonishes me.  Could you imagine, though, being a guy...  Well, it doesn't matter.  What am I saying? 
[01:01:00]  Imagine being the guy at Fox who has to think that stuff up.  It doesn't matter.  They go, okay, so then we're just going to have somebody come on with a box and hold  it up and bang it against their head.  And then we're going to get that guy who has the cheese head and dances around.  And then there are going to be guys with shadow puppets.  We'll do that for 20 minutes.  I mean, they don't care.  What do they care?  And then we'll run some ads.  Oh, God.  And then they act like...  Does it really work?  Advertising really worked?  Is it people really thinking, oh, boy, they're going to have, like, Yahoo's apparently just 
[01:01:30]  before the kickoff?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you know where people go just before the kickoff?  They go to the can.  They won't always be watching.  Oh, good.  Great.  Finally, a break.  That's true.  It is.  I guess you're looking forward to the Super Bowl there, Lewis.  I usually love...  I mean, I like football.  Any sport where big guys run against each other and bang each other at will, I get a  big kick out of it.  I like football a lot, but, you know...  Oh, boy, Denver and Atlanta. 
[01:02:00]  Why don't they...  Woo-hoo!  Oh, boy.  Am I excited now?  I got no place to bet, so that's exhausting.  You know, it's not like you want to get on the phone.  There's nothing fun about calling a bookie up.  You want to be somewhere where there are a bunch of people, you know, having boxes and  stuff, you know, random betting where, you know, how many people be injured in the  first half, that kind of stuff.  But, no, I won't be watching it.  I don't think I'll watch it.  Of course I'll watch it.  Even if I'm alone, I'll watch it. 
[01:02:30]  It's sad.  As much as I scream, I'll be sitting there and go, okay, come on, come on.  Okay, no, don't you hate yourself at the end of the game where you find yourself, like,  kind of getting worked up?  Oh, yeah.  Like, you can't stand the two teams.  You really don't care.  But it's a close game.  And, like, all right, they're on the five-yard line trying to have this last push for a touch.  And you're like, yeah.  Oh, my God, those bastards got me caught up in it.  I hate them for that.  Well, the only thing that's nice when you have two teams you don't like is you just want  it to be a good game.  Yeah.  If it's not a good game, then I'd be, then I will be. 
[01:03:00]  Lots of injuries with people you don't care about.  Exactly.  Yeah, with a story where the third stringer comes off the bench.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, he's all pumped up with whatever steroid they've got left.  Yeah, maybe a good...  The year, you know, when I football for me was amazing.  The year that the, this is a true story, the year that the Redskins, who were the team  I root for when I was a kid, finally won the Super Bowl, the next year, the entire  secondary, except for, I believe, Daryl Green, who I believe was around initially at that 
[01:03:30]  time, who just got on the team, was busted for cocaine dealing and abuse.  And the next year, we didn't come close to winning anything.  And I said, hey, there's a lesson to be learned.  Yeah, there you go.  When you've got a druggist there and your druggist is doing well, don't trade your druggist.  Well, we're going to have fun with the Super Bowl this year.  We're going to a listener's house, Lewis.  Yeah, that's good.  Yeah, they're sending us.  You know what?  And that makes me feel a lot better about being alone.  You can tell they really love us around here at N.E.W.  Let's send Opie and Anthony to a stranger's house for the Super Bowl. 
[01:04:00]  Well, that'll increase ratings, one person at a time.  Where are you going to go?  I guess Easter, you'll be going to an Easter dinner with somebody every holiday.  Mother's Day.  Yeah, Friday.  They're lighting the Sabbath candles with Opie and Anthony.  Which is only one million people to go.  This is good.  One at a time, we'll win you over.  How big of a party is it?  As many people as they want to invite over.  Yeah.  We're just hoping we get someone cool.  You don't want some, you know,  I'm here with Ma. 
[01:04:30]  So it's Opie and Anthony, me and my mom, watching.  I was like, oh, great.  You're at the mercy, and they could just bring some punch out laced with LSD.  Yeah.  Yeah, here.  Come on, guys.  Oh.  I'm just waiting.  We get that.  We got them good.  And then the Pulp Fiction music starts out.  Yeah.  Find ourselves tied up with that red rubber ball in our mouth.  Yeah.  Either that or, you know, an episode of Cops will be filmed.  They'll bust the door down, and I'll be the guy sitting on the four keys of Coke that I didn't know were stuffed in the couch. 
[01:05:00]  You know, well, it becomes the wall.  It becomes the wall.  Oh, great.  But I'm just here as a pshh.  Oh, I'm going to plunder up my keister.  Oh, well.  Good luck to us.  Yes.  Hopefully, we'll be back on the radio Monday.  We'll have fun.  It'll be a good afternoon.  Nothing better than a lot of Bloody Marys than people you don't know.  Yeah, this will be some sort of a family breakdown.  Can you imagine being a witness to that?  Oh, man.  Just like, oh.  You son of a bitch.  I always hated you.  You always were the big brother. 
[01:05:30]  You son of a bitch.  A big fist to fight with brothers.  Why do you wear dresses on the weekend?  Oh, look at the time.  And then the guy, and then your boss going, no, you have to stay.  Yeah, you have to stay.  No, you're going to stay.  You have to have bitter end.  Oh, boy.  Do you record it or anything?  We'll just kind of sit and take notes.  We'll take notes.  We'll talk about it on Monday.  Yeah, it's a life experience.  We'll do some phoners with whoever's on the air.  It'll be fun. 
[01:06:00]  It'll be great.  The people make out great.  They get a big Sony big screen TV.  53-inch screen TV.  And they keep it.  They keep it?  Yeah.  So they went out, and then we sit there.  Hopefully get along with these people.  Well, they bet.  You give them a 53-inch TV.  They better like us, right?  They better be wiping your butt.  All right.  I guess we've got to get you out of here, Lewis.  Well, not on a wipe-your-butt line.  What, fire ants in the pee-pee hole?  That's true. 
[01:06:30]  We should have been a closer.  I was begging for it.  Good night, everyone.  That was great.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  So we'll be at Caroline's tonight?  Yep.  And I'll be back and see you guys in a couple of weeks.  Please do.  Whenever you want.  We'd love to stop by.  I have a...  Next week, we're in San Antonio.  For those of you who are in San Antonio, next Thursday.  We might be getting a bounce off a cloud right now.  Maybe they're listening to us.  Listening on KNEW.  San Antonio.  Yeah.  I'll be down there watching the Spurs.  No, I won't be doing that.  I won't be watching basketball. 
[01:07:00]  I still watch college basketball.  Yes.  I don't know.  A game that's not sullied.  All right.  A special bonus for you faithful listeners.  Tenth caller right now wins a $50 multi-sport passport to Chelsea Piers.  And you also qualify to have a Super Bowl party thrown at your house this Sunday.  Where we bring over the 53-inch Sony projection screen TV.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  Sophie and Anthony.  Hey.  Just about out the door.  Another fine show today.  Thanks for listening.  Got to thank Louis Black for hanging with us once again today. 
[01:07:30]  I have a feeling he's going to become a regular on our show.  Come in like every two weeks or so and just shoot the S with us about current events.  Yeah.  He's got it going on.  And he'll be at Caroline's tonight if you want to check him out.  Yeah.  Very funny man.  As you know, we like him.  Rick is telling me before we leave, we got to talk to this girl.  We got to.  She tried the Hummer technique yesterday.  Ooh.  This Hummer technique is sweeping the city.  The Laura Korn technique from her new book. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  We talked to somebody yesterday that used this.  Hi.  Hi.  And thank you for referring to me as a girl.  I'm way past that stage.  But thank you.  A woman.  That's better.  A woman.  How old are you?  I'll be 38 in August.  That's a woman, baby.  Mom.  Yeah, and I got myself a young man, too.  Uh-oh.  How old?  My husband's going to be 29 in February.  Ah, a little boy toy, as you girls like to call him.  You got it going on.  Yeah.  So, you heard about the Hummer technique?  Yes. 
[01:08:30]  Did you hear Laura Korn give it out?  Yeah.  No, no.  I heard you guys spill the beans.  Yeah.  Oh, yesterday.  Real fast forward, you're back to the Laura Korn book is called 52 Invitations to Great  Sex, and you can order it by calling 1-800-547-BONK.  So many people are calling us for that number, so there you go.  So, what happened?  Well, he kind of suspected something was up because he went into the freezer and the ice  tray was there, and we don't normally have ice in the freezer. 
[01:09:00]  Only special occasions.  And he kind of, when I told him, you know, okay, bring a tray and a tie into the bedroom,  he kind of expected the cold, but he was totally, totally taken by surprise from the  hot tea.  Because he was expecting the cold.  He's like, okay, this is going to be cold, blah, blah, blah.  And he's like, ah!  He's right here, by the way.  He just walked in the door.  He's laughing along with you guys.  Oh, we got to talk to him.  You want to talk to him?  So, the technique, basically, you blindfold the man, and then you take turns with the 
[01:09:30]  hot and cold liquids.  Exactly.  As you're performing the Hummer.  Right, exactly.  And he doesn't know what's coming at him because he's blindfolded.  No, absolutely no idea whatsoever.  So, when the warm hit, what happened?  Oh, it was just amazing.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Do you want to talk to him?  He's right here.  Sure.  All right, hold on.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Good.  Sounds like you're doing pretty good.  Oh, I'm doing great, man.  Unbelievable.  Sorry if I sound a little like Sylvester the cat. 
[01:10:00]  I just got back from the dentist.  What happened to you?  Oh, what, last night?  Oh, my God.  No, at the dentist.  Oh, yeah.  You did the drilling last night, and you got drilled today, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  Sorry.  No, that was great.  I couldn't resist, man.  That was like, that's a slow pitch.  I had to hit over the fence, man.  You always got to go for the cheap shots.  So you got home last night, and you were expecting something?  Well, she had been talking, and we both were listening to the radio the other day when Laura  Korn was on, and we were having a little trouble in that department, and she seemed really 
[01:10:30]  interested.  Oh.  So I kind of was like, hmm, yeah, you never know.  But you guys didn't spill to me, and she didn't tell what the secret technique was.  So I got home, and she's like, well, grab a tray, grab a tie, and wait for me in the bedroom.  Oh, okay.  What else am I going to do, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  No problem.  So I went into the bedroom, and she blindfolded me with a tie, and oh, my God. 
[01:11:00]  Was it the best ever?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was incredible.  Really?  It was incredible.  I couldn't walk for like an hour.  How about that?  And she just alternated with the cold and the hot.  Yeah, yeah.  It's mind-blowing.  It's absolutely mind-blowing.  Well, mine's something else.  Whatever.  So if you're out there and you're listening, buy the book.  Buy, well.  When it's out.  Trust me, we sold the lady enough books. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, I can imagine.  At this point, we want our listeners just to try the technique.  Yeah.  Because we're trying to blackmail people to listen to our show at this point.  Oh, I could do that, too.  So if we could tell you guys how to get a better Hummer, I think you'll never forget us.  Definitely not.  Definitely not.  It's kind of imprinted on my psyche at this point.  And are you guys members of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club?  Yes, we are.  All right.  We just had a huge meeting about that today.  We're going to have some T-shirts and some hats.  Some Hummer wear.  Hummer wear, yeah. 
[01:12:00]  That's what we like to call it.  And we're going to give all the money to a good charity.  Oh, that's cool.  It's about time Anthony and I do something really good.  Okay, I'll definitely be into that.  Try to outweigh all the bad.  Well, we'll try anyway.  All right.  Well, congratulations.  Thanks a lot, guys.  And thank you.  No problem.  Believe me, thank you.  All right, man.  Who's the station that gets you fantastic Hummers?  Probably the N-E-W.  I hate when stations do that.  What's your favorite radio station? 
[01:12:30]  I don't know.  Well, at this point, I thought a good station name would be Z-100.  Of course they're going to say the station.  All right, man.  What's the station that makes you blow the top of your wife's head off?  You guys have a good night.  All right.  You too, man.  Bye-bye.  We've got to get out of here.  Thanks, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, you guys have a good one.  All right.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Yeah.  No late show today.  No, I don't feel like it.  And we'll do a late show tomorrow. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  All right.  All right, man.  Well, thanks.  That was fun.  Tomorrow is FU Friday.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  And a lot of people call and they want us to play broad bingo.  We haven't played that in a while.  We might be able to squeeze out a game tomorrow.  Oh, yeah.  That's always fun.  All right.  It's a fun Friday thing.  All right.  Well, we're out of here, so...  Are we picking our winner tomorrow, too?  Yeah.  For the Super Bowl party Sunday?  Yeah.  Okay.  Not much else to say, so we'll see you tomorrow at 3. 
[01:13:30]  See you tomorrow.  Have a good night.  I'm just...  What?  I'm just putting my papers away.  I see.  Okay.  Oh, it fell.  Pick it up.  Okay. </pre>
