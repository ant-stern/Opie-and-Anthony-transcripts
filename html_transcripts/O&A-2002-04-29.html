<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts promoting their "Wow" bumper sticker campaign and dissecting a Penthouse magazine featuring a model falsely advertised as Anna Kournikova.  They engaged in a heated exchange with a caller, Mike, about a hockey game.  Anthony then recounted a disastrous Andrew Dice Clay show featuring a heavily intoxicated and disruptive audience of Opie and Anthony listeners, followed by a bizarre late-night interior design consultation from Dice himself.  The hosts subsequently discussed HBO's "Ecstasy Dad" documentary, prompting numerous caller reactions to the father's shocking behavior.

A substantial portion of the show centered on Tom, an employee from their New Orleans affiliate, whose job title was initially misconstrued by the hosts.  Concerns were raised regarding Tom's excessive drinking and its impact on his work as a sales manager. A call with Lee, the station's new general manager, provided updates on upcoming studio renovations and reassured the hosts about the station's broadcast stability.  Interspersed with the Tom discussion was Anthony's expulsion from the "Cats and Hats" guild in EverQuest, sparking a humorous discussion with callers, including a "recovering EverQuest junkie" and a 12-year-old player, "Dark Thor."

The show then shifted to promoting their 2002 celebrity softball game, detailing past events, potential participants (Jim Brewer, Jay Moore, Greg Brady, Adam Ferrara, and possibly Andrew Dice Clay), ticket sales, sponsors (Coors Light), and humorous anecdotes from previous games, including a memorable "cocaine-induced dump" in the locker room.  A playful argument ensued between Opie and Anthony about team selection and "ringers." A call with Tom finally clarified his situation: he received a memo prohibiting alcohol consumption during remote broadcasts, with the hosts expressing support.

The broadcast continued with a series of phone calls.  One caller, Tom, exhibited apparent depression, prompting jokes from the hosts.  Another caller, Devita, made sexually aggressive and vulgar comments. The hosts then launched into a discussion of the Boston Catholic priest child molestation scandal, employing highly offensive and sexually charged language, including playing a John Valby song with extremely vulgar lyrics on the same topic. Numerous calls followed, expressing negative opinions on "new Tom" and the show's direction, alongside equally offensive opinions on the priest abuse scandal.

Later, Chris Barron from the Spin Doctors called in to promote their show, discussing band infighting.  This led to a discussion about a male stripper allegedly fondling a disabled woman, prompting further calls, including one from Laura Orban, who suggested a shockingly vulgar method for the softball game's first pitch.  The show concluded with "What Did We Learn Today?" calls featuring vulgar and humorous takeaways, more jokes about Tom and the priest scandal, and additional Miss Cleo prank calls.

[00:32:30]  minute his eyes are just shut like he's in a coma and there's the father walking around with his  frosted hair he has his like bleach blonde he's got his visor his rave visor upside down guys in his  early 40s and he's raving and selling e to kids at raves on camera on television and supervising the  rave parties at whose apartment was that his own it was uh it was his son's uh his 18 year old son's  apartment they were hanging out in and there's the 13 year old just totally just rolling and they 
[00:33:00]  they put the the vicks under his nose under his eyes he's like ow when the little kid goes ow it was  really sad to see awful horrible and this guy is just skipping through life with his shoelaces untied  the guy is just uh the most irresponsible father ever and one of the best parts though when he rolls up to  his house he's making out with uh how old was that chick he was a black chick yeah i don't know 
[00:33:30]  she looked about 15 16 she looked like she was still in high school yeah oh yeah that's all he  hung out with he's a big raver hey kids he's dressed up i swear to god at one point he's in  a convenience store he's dressed just like his 18 year old son exactly with the dopey upside down  visor sideways on his head you know it's fine if you're 15 at a rave if you're in your early 40s  don't put the visor upside down on your head i would have walked up to him say are you filming 
[00:34:00]  a movie here what are you doing is this one of those you switched personalities with your kid and  he's going to the office in a suit where's kirk cameron where's where's the little child from the  wonder years where's fred savage didn't he do that too right that's what it looked like switch what was  it called switch with his snatch panties and octopus pants mitch what's going on hey was it just me  here did the uh merit the ecstasy dad looked like rich boss yeah he had a little rich boss  actually just a little bit i know the struggle and how quick did he lose that frosted hair when 
[00:34:30]  he went to court no ass well the best part was when uh he's driving up to his house and there's  just sheriff vehicles all in front of his finally on to him he stopped it took long enough yeah and  i bet you the hbo documentary crew were the real ones that tipped off uh the sheriff well they should  you know something when he pulled up to his apartment he's about 10 he's about 10 yards away  from the sheriff vehicles and there's like looking at his vehicle they know it's him and he's like he's 
[00:35:00]  talking to the camera what should i do i got three pills on me right now and some pot i could leave i  could i could just go right they can't do it i don't have to go into my i don't have to go into my  apartment right now do i i would have loved to see him try to run that would have been hysterical  but he went up to his apartment and idiot move number 836 of the episode he starts just telling  the cops everything everything they're questioning him and he's like well i have three uh pills on me  i got some pot uh we found these small little ziploc bags um in abundance in your apartment what 
[00:35:30]  are these used for anything first of all don't say anything at that point you go i'd like to just  have my attorney i'm not really going to answer anything else and then your conversation over  if you're going to say anything say i pack my kids very tiny sandwiches finger anything you  don't say i put small amounts of pot in it which is what he said right and the guy's like oh for  distribution what do you give people your pot he goes well i don't deal all right so you pack them  up in the little things so you could what have them the guy was an idiot uh bonehead brian what's going 
[00:36:00]  on what's going on hey um with this uh like thing they're saying you guys are saying like you know he  gave the access to the kids they're saying that he left the money on the table he said he didn't  know he left that no no he knew exactly what was going on the father he's the most irresponsible guy  when you put your kids in that environment it's it's your fault like the guy whether the guy gave  him the e gave him the money or or didn't give him anything just that they're in that environment 
[00:36:30]  is enough where he is completely uh responsible for what happened to that kid well completely  irresponsible i mean i like me with one of my kids i would never leave like i would never be  partying with my kids like that and like the guy thought you know it was weird because the guy  thought he was the cool dad oh he wasn't the cool dad look i'm cool dad look i'm going on a beer run  what does everyone need alcohol uh anybody anyone what does the 13 year old want 151 what do you need kid 
[00:37:00]  it was just it was a crazy i i turned it on the middle of the show i missed part of the beginning but  i mean it was just like i was completely amazed by what was going on with that yeah completely  amazed we'll get the audio clips and we'll play them uh tomorrow brendan brings up a great point when  uh when the kid was uh lecturing his father now this 18 year old was an f-up to begin with but he's  18 you know you're an f-up you're not the father and he's sitting there saying you know dad you know  you can't be giving you know 13 year old uh he at this age  uh you know what he was smoking a lot of pot just smoking pot the whole show but he's lecturing 
[00:37:30]  his father on how irresponsible his father is as they're all just drinking and doing dope  really really funny hbo special ecstasy dad funny and i got sounds like a cosby movie ecstasy dad  funny but really sad yeah man seeing the 13 year old roland was just his eyes were just like  completely at half mass the whole time he's freaking out oh and the daughter put her hands 
[00:38:00]  together put your hands together like you're praying now move your hand like a serpent going  back and forth and stare at it for hours not only stare at it she was following she was following it  with her head heads going back and forth like this over and over again as they're talking to one of the  kids mike what's going on hey what's going on guys hey um two quick points first of all on a serious  note i genuinely felt there for those kids they really loved each other even though all that crap  they were going through those kids were hugging each other and stuff they were real tight well 
[00:38:30]  that's what you do when you're on ecstasy right no i mean even when they were straight they were  doing it but at a funny point though my wife was saying you know what they must be real proud of  the older one because he was going to west point and if you followed it at the end when they gave notes  and all the kids all the other kids were cleaned up and that kid was serving eight months for  for robbery with a handgun yeah if you saw that it was pretty funny so much for his little army hat  his little army hat but that guy was unbelievable that kid's name was uh joe bro joe the oldest one 
[00:39:00]  when the father looks into the camera goes i'm gonna get in trouble for this huh like cops or  something well yeah no no you'll be the pillar of society how is he what is it what did he think  it was going to come out on hbo everything he's doing and and he's going to be invited to the next  pta meeting and what about him just going to the high school football game and just schmoozing with  the kids yeah tell them where the party's going to be at and yeah he's just getting dressed up like 
[00:39:30]  he's 15 a little dangerous you know that was one of the weird there's nothing i hate more than a  parent that tries to be one of the kids oh he totally was doing that yeah all parents that do  that just give it up your childhood is over you're closer to death stop living through your stupid  child even the ones that are good and just you know let's be a friend to the kid so he'll come and  talk to us yeah we're pals me and my boy we're pals best of friends we're friends first then father and  son i think please give it up dan what's up yeah i was going back to boss i have a suggestion for 
[00:40:00]  him next time he goes on a road trip yeah a couple of tortillas or tortillas and then go rent the movie  godzilla a little late but very fun thank you godzilla godzilla i like that movie i just love that there's  parents like this though i love the fact there's parents just destroying their children yeah it is  pretty good the parents groups always complain about your show and your tasteless humor and yet 
[00:40:30]  this is awful keep ruining your stupid kids jr what's up yeah what's going on boys hey man i'm on  so we used to rave in brooklyn constantly if we saw someone remotely close to 30 years old they were  getting beaten like logan's run if i saw that guy in any type of rave in brooklyn or queens in a warehouse  he would have got beaten unmercifully yeah you got no business going to those he kept coming 
[00:41:00]  dude what's up dog what's up dog dog you don't want to be the old guy at the club  you don't want to be the old guy at the club that's the kid is he gets smacked his son gets smacked  they take his daughter out in the back for a good time you know we make him really learn his lesson  before he starts selling toast to his kid you know it was really funny too when uh they're fold he's  folding socks with his son and cats in the cradle started playing and then he got all teary and  started crying in the cradle and the silver spoon little boy blue in the man and the moon when you're

[01:13:30]  i was gonna say well at least you have one left no oh god very funny  hey but i think when i think rejection in your life yeah well no no this  elite three minus one at least you still got two well  sorry no  everquest you know i've been playing that for uh about a year now about a year  level uh 53 shaman opie shaman on the adrenal server 
[01:14:00]  and uh yes you might as well talk to the wall behind you well a lot of people say everquest  but you're saying stuff i can't comprehend there are different servers are you speaking polish what  are you speaking it is the mystical land of north opie and it's on different servers it's the same land  on every server but you pick the server you want to be on can one guy from one server play another guy  on another server no no no no you're exclusive to your server that would be even though it's the 
[01:14:30]  same lands on every server you're a different group of people well our people they can only  handle so many people let's ask uh because this is there's a lot of chicks that want to know about  this is um exactly yes jimmy is uh like people on your server like say i know that it's disgusting  as this is to me that there are people that are considered very high up because oh yes of course  are guys on your server well known to guys like guys on keith's server do they know each other is  i don't think so i think that they they know each other on a very casual from the everquest get  together right yeah and perhaps from the message 500 men and one cantaloupe that they pass around and 
[01:15:00]  put their mules in there's not one girl shows up make sure you microwave it get a little warm  and the higher you're ranked the uh you know closer to first you get to go we're all better level  level 53 has to follow eight or nine mules in that cantaloupe well yeah yes about seven i guess  since you camp off at level 60. yeah there might be five sixties there i'm working on my way up who's  the loser that's at level one uh the newbies the guy who's getting laid that's who the new 
[01:15:30]  you all goes outside and enjoys the sunshine even to mighty level 60 of the all start at level one  all of us had to start at level one with that first step you gotta crawl before you can walk  exactly little jimmy exactly well opie um i'm at level 53 like i said and uh it looks to me like  it's gonna be a little rougher for old land to reach level 60. remember how excited i was about a  month ago on these very airwaves i explained to everybody how i was brought in to a community 
[01:16:00]  on the drenau server the cats and hats guild do you remember this now what's jimmy norton what's  a guild i thought you're already in the the community oh yes in this alternate world these  are groups of people that gather that get together and form what are known as guilds  and you fight other guilds well sometimes you can on the player versus player servers shut up but  but for the most part one person explained this is enough i'm gonna go nuts and to answer your 
[01:16:30]  question no i don't remember it i blocked it out like a childhood priest incident  it's being which we got a great john valby song anyway see opie um there's some high level  creatures roaming these mystical lands that you can't take out just by yourself you can't do it  by yourself you need a group of people and what better group than a group that you know and trust  and work like a well-oiled machine a guild a guild of people say 30 or so people that can go on a raid 
[01:17:00]  and take down a huge dragon better known as a fraternity of nerds whatever you'd like to call  them they are called guilds in everquest and if you remember i was accepted to the cats in hats  even though i was only a level 50 at the time op they are strict level 60s only but some fans of the  show on the uh they allowed me in now i was wondering i was wondering why you weren't wearing  your wizard cap today and your cape exactly no wizard cap and i shan't be wearing it anymore 
[01:17:30]  i um i was forced out of the guild last night why i was forced out of the cats and hats guild  by this is your rejection by three of the four officers of the guild officers there are officers  of the guild they elect officers one officer shinro very nice guy fan of the show he didn't 
[01:18:00]  want uh me out of the guild the other three i think the head guy's name is learn l-e-r-n  kill him the mother fp he he you know what he says him and the other officers opie huh  that's what they said fantasy land of the guild yeah in everquest cats and hats sure  that i did nothing to help the guild i don't contribute anything i don't go on enough raids  i don't go on any raids is he talking about this radio show oh oh he's talking about everquest 
[01:18:30]  everquest well maybe they were just mad that during your threesome you had more women than  any of them have ever had yeah they heard that story on the air and said hell man he's too good for us i  was very um i was getting pissed off because uh shinro had told me that they were thinking about booting me  out because i don't contribute and a lot of people getting upset that i'm in there at a lowly level  53 and these people had to work up to level 60 so i took it upon myself and said you know something 
[01:19:00]  i'm leaving did you have butterflies in your stomach as i as i typed in you know  guild remove guild remove and hit that enter key so they were and saw cats and hats disappear from my  name so they were going to kick you out they were going to kick me out it was like a forced  resignation but they gave you the choice no no no i have some pride i took it upon myself to have  some pride because i saw it coming i saw them booting me out i will not have an ultimatum put to me  right you don't kick me out i kick you out cats and hats don't have that kind of muscle anymore you 
[01:19:30]  goddamn cats and hats really make me laugh you took frano in because the adrenal server was they had me  looking ridiculous and a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous i've never  right that word pronounced that way ridiculous so i was how ridiculous do you uh i felt ridiculous  and rejected ridiculous because now i'm going to be going through the mythical land right and people 
[01:20:00]  are going to see my name they're going to see my name and they won't see cats and hats next to it  just not going to command the respect right now they're going to look and go oh what happened oh  boy because people would see it and go oh dude you're in like one of the uber power guilds all right  and i'd be like yes yes i am so don't mess with me don't mess with me now i'm like an outcast like  a piece of trash that has been thrown away there are some nice people ted yule he was very nice shinro 
[01:20:30]  very nice tricksy very nice but this learn and these other bastard officers of that guild my wrath upon  you know that learn is probably 14. yep 15 maybe you gotta look okay i understand that by a 14. i  understand that but we are all equal we are all equal on the server oh you got rejected by a 14. all  right rub it in rub it in that's great you're the creepy old guy i'm selling them ecstasy and 
[01:21:00]  everything you know what do i get in return you don't want to be the old guy in a guild you don't  want to be the old guy in the guild aren't there any other i was frosting my hair and everything  under my wizard cap you are rolling with the teenagers isn't there another group of zeros  that will accept you in well you know something i i don't know if i might just go around and be a  loner for a while well you might need like a cooler guild like a disciples of justice on the iona  rose over disciples of justice mark of honor mark of honor perhaps right that's very gay cats and 
[01:21:30]  hats gay name oh gay name how about you join you're a bunch of homosexuals how about you join this guild  the human race not exciting enough opie when do you get to slay dragons in the human race yeah how  about the i never pull out because who cares what happens to her guild what's the matter with you  people you're all guys well i get a hold of yourselves uncle john hey what's up guys hey 
[01:22:00]  yes you know what's really sad is that these people have nothing better than to sit around  and discuss whether you should be there in a first place i know you know what there's a whole  discussion going on they are they scared to tell you do they i think they were do they nominate  one person to tell you a lot of them probably not yeah the show they're probably from other places  that i think that was a big thing to do because everybody i considered myself you know something when  people like john wayne and whatnot go off to war they're not really fighting they're there to  get the troops morale up right you know like benny goodman right he'd bring his clarinet and 
[01:22:30]  everything was fine and dandy he's not picking up the gun i thought that was my role maybe you should  have brought your rusty trombone i was like the entertainer all right i didn't go on the raids but i was  there as a member of the guild kind of you know hey they're kind of you know i'm on the air i'm on  the radio and they're promoting it i'm like the publicity guy they were carrying you weren't they  tossed aside like trash because they were carrying you they were not carrying me what did you do you

[01:43:30]  2002 opian anthony celebrity softball game it goes down saturday june 1st riverfront stadium newark new  jersey sponsored in part by coars light dude i'm telling you the stadium's beautiful it's unbelievable  look at james from jersey i went two years ago tickets were five bucks syndication equals higher  prices i guess 30 million isn't enough james we are not getting paid for this we're not taking  we're not getting money for this we will not collect the dime we actually it costs money to 
[01:44:00]  put these things on and we want to do a better job than we did the first time for five bucks  dude it's a ten dollar ticket what are you going to do for ten bucks don't explain yourself to him  yeah they're making money on it no we're not i know that but i want him to think you are  what pisses me off about that is you know uh management around here is like why don't we charge  twenty twenty five dollars a ticket i know you should be in some of these meetings so we knocked it down  and we're still getting abused why don't you charge fifty three bucks do you get a hat with that you 
[01:44:30]  get a hat so all right if you can't afford ten bucks screw you don't go tickets go on sale this  wednesday may 1st at 5 p.m ten bucks a full day of fun tickets are ten dollars and are available at  all ticketmaster outlets or at the riverfront stadium box office get your tickets during our wow sticker  stop with black girl and frenchy at riverfront stadium on wednesday that's this wednesday  second be there from 4 to 6 p.m at the stadium to get your wow stickers and your and your tickets  for the uh the game how was frenchy trying to get backstage at uh dice open frenchy's the most 
[01:45:00]  annoying guy was it fun i get a phone call here's my phone call i'm sitting i'm sitting at home  and i get the call hello anthony yes frenchy how did you know it was me all right what do you want frenchy  i'm at the dice show i cannot get backstage i see opie opie hello i see opie i'm waving but club 
[01:45:30]  soda kenny is such an a-hole he's an a-hole he will not let me backstage  not frenchy i'll i'll call opie i'll uh message on his machine frenchy the only guy that wanted to  get backstage the only guy i must see dies what's the big deal it's dice club soda kenny is being an  a-hole he will not let me he will not let me backstage he was just like saying how much of an  a-hole club soda kenny was to me because they weren't they weren't letting anyone backstage 
[01:46:00]  they don't really do that good for kenny good for kenny and dice comes to town three or four times a  year it seems like i mean frenchy could just come by the station for a stupid picture and all i'm  thinking is frenchy's gonna get his ass handed to him by kenny because i've seen i've seen fans walk  up the dice at a table at a restaurant and go um mr clay i just wanted to say i love you and before  they get like love your work or anything kenny is grabbing them and shoving them away get away from 
[01:46:30]  the legend he was not he will not speak when he is having dinner he was i've seen kenny just stand up  and like he just leans in and makes real close eye contact and they go away yeah he's a scary  mother ever he doesn't hit people that if they ever tried to do anything inappropriate that would be a  really bad judgment well i i guess so uh joanne yes what's up just wanted to know if uh dice was  going to bring his own hat to the game i'm bringing the hats for the team hats hey maybe this time around 
[01:47:00]  we could get softballs there's something let's get softballs for our softball game oh remember yeah  we just didn't have like right the right softballs right one guy promised uh he'd bring brand new  softballs we had one softball one one softball for our big celebrity softball game and one that he  could barely hit out of the infield because it was uh it felt like it was in a puddle overnight yeah  it was all gooey and mushy just wet and it was just a dead ball but uh i gotta say props man to 
[01:47:30]  uh matt devotee for calling the game the whole three minutes of the first inning  then he just left his post and and no one heard an announcement of the game anyway yeah we had some  problems uh during our first one but we're working out all the bugs i mean not to take anything away  from ben and rick they did a great job at the last one but we had problems we assumed that matt  the body who's a he has a great voice anthony yeah we said hey could you call the game because  that'll make it more interesting to the fans and the in the stands uh-huh and like you said after 
[01:48:00]  like two outs he decided just he needed to uh walk around and watch chicks flash or something i don't  know what he was doing so we're gonna try to get scott farrell this year as long as he doesn't take  his own life by the time uh well we're hoping that uh he can keep it together come on hold it together  hold it together for one more month we need you in the broadcast booth for our celebrity softball  game he'll do a great job great job with that oh yeah we're gonna have to have the hot cheerleader 
[01:48:30]  auditions and maybe add some hot cheerleaders and maybe this year when uh when we have our celebrity  quote celebrity throw out the first pitch maybe he could throw it to the catcher instead of throwing  it over the stadium wall what you don't remember psycho mark oh yeah uh he got fired so he brought  him back uh for the game yeah and the place went bull ass yeah and he was supposed to you know throw  out the the ceremonial uh pitch there decides he just needs to throw it as far and as hard as he could 
[01:49:00]  yeah it went over everyone's head oh i mean it pretty much left the stadium he threw the first pitch and  he threw the ball away and then he went back into center field on that uh that couch and and and  got high the whole game that's what we got out of him last time yeah and uh one of the most memorable  moments was going going into the uh locker room where the strippers stripper cheerleaders were right when  one of them did probably the biggest cocaine crunch the biggest cocaine induced dump and it stunk the 
[01:49:30]  entire locker room up this big canned coke head stripper  you know that one of our so-called strippers from the last game turned out to be uh an escort  escort escort really stop even using the nice name a prostitute a prostitute prostitute 
[01:50:00]  you're a prostitute what a mess in it all in a fashion though it was great yeah great as that  and then uh i don't know what happened at the end of the game but we had we literally had thousands  of dollars worth of prizes from all our sponsors yeah and we announced we'd give out the prize at the  end of the game there was there was i was it going to be a riot something was going on i don't know  i have audio rick sarone though now you get the hell out of here rick sarone was there yeah he runs 
[01:50:30]  the place he runs the place actually i can catch it good he was on my team too he did nothing for my  team rick we love you but you did nothing for my team i'm thinking rick sarone okay cool  ah major league ball player maybe worth a run on the board somewhere nothing nothing  thurman munson nothing not by his choice that determined yeah he uh was the catcher yeah hope  he's bringing in ringers ringers i can understand your brother but when you stop bringing your 
[01:51:00]  brother's friends your brother's friends that are on like professional softball teams he had a few  try out ringer a few tryouts it's like the gas house gorillas playing bugs bunny you did exactly what  it was like you did the same thing though you brought a guy you thought was a ringer and  he died and he stunk who that um some friend of somebody or something from staten island or  whatever i don't know oh no no uh my girlfriend's brother-in-law okay he was supposed to be a ringer 
[01:51:30]  too he's actually you know something he didn't give you much he got a cheap call out uh because  because somebody waved them in remember past third he was supposed to hold it third someone  yeah earl threw him out and he dropped the fly ball and right but that was that was just one of his at  bats still at least it was someone i knew opie's bringing in people i don't even know who they  are i've seen them on baseball cards jose that guy looks familiar who is he it was jose canseco 
[01:52:00]  i kicked your ass it was a romp the big rematch happens june 1st all i know is i heard yelling and  stuff in your dugout and and you were all so serious over there and mine uh the dugout floor  was just covered with beer yeah but and and booze you had a secret weapon though if you remember my  friend and why and it backfired jay moore's wife making believe she was just uh hanging out in our  dugout even though her husband jay was on your team uh-huh she was spiking everyone's uh beer with uh 
[01:52:30]  straight vodka yeah trying to get him as drunk as possible it didn't work that backfired yeah  well i can't wait hopefully this year it's our year it's our year and no trick sound like socks  fans i don't our year i don't do trick pitch no trick oh your pitching sucked man you should have  been illegal you have to swing backspin you know what he would do yeah he'd throw he'd pitch the  ball in he would pitch the ball the catcher would throw it back and the second it hit opie's glove he'd 
[01:53:00]  throw it again well and and i'm like i'm like no screw this i kept telling everybody and they wouldn't  listen to me i go the second that pitch hits the catcher's glove if you didn't swing at it  step out of the box earl how many strikeouts in a half seriously like that's it it was ridiculous  slow pitch softball i thought it was more than that the second he gets the ball he throws it  right back at you it's ridiculous hey kurt it's what what's up ridiculous what's up kurt go 
[01:53:30]  oh hey fellas hey hey i heard uh you know thanks to syndication uh cable is a little pissed  uh there's gonna be on the youth network the yes network yeah that's good thank you guys suck  all right you know i'm thinking maybe if i talk to uh our own eddie trunk here that does the uh  rock and roll show on the weekend who is he good friends with piazza mike piazza  perhaps i could get mike piazza on my team yeah i'm sure he wouldn't have a game or the  mets would let him go for a minute to do this if bobby brady could get joe namath to throw balls in

[02:01:00]  a man on first and one out and they knew i was going to strike out so bad that they actually decided  to steal um oh no there was two outs so i'm i'm down oh two and they make the guy steal and he gets  thrown out so i don't even get to finish my at bat oh i'm trying to steal second 13 to one in the  last they knew you weren't going to do a thing now they knew old fat belly was going to fail again  hey anthony a lot of people want to know if your aunt could uh sing the national anthem  my aunt i i mean your mom oh my mom i'm sorry that would be interesting wouldn't it that would be

[02:14:00]  uh that have been touching uh children from boston that's great go socks no hitter there and we're  hoping that tom calls the f u line so we find out what happened yeah yeah we won't know it's tom hi i  got a f u for the new guy wow the instant feedback is brutal tool from philly this tom sucks they killed  tom i want my old tom back right party hearty tom you know rob from rockland tom sounds like nicholson 
[02:14:30]  after he got shock therapy and cuckoo's nest we need a huge indian to suffocate him and throw a thing  through the window that's great can you with me tom oh well great yeah anyway go ahead sorry well  in his first legal response to the charges that the reverend paul r shanley began molesting a newton  boy when he was six years old newton isn't that where uh brucey midman is from the shuggy hater 
[02:15:00]  boys um cardinal bernard f law as if he isn't in enough uh crap this guy cardinal law has asserted the  negligence by the boy and his parents contributed to the alleged abuse a six-year-old yes negligence  by the boy and his parents how dare the parents have a such exactly so some predator dirtbag wouldn't 
[02:15:30]  touch him well see this is just part of the uh legal wrangling you're gonna see um with these  priests they all went they met at the vatican opi they talked to the pope the pope said  it's bad the pope in a i thought the pope said keep your mules in your pants well that would have  been even better in a mind-blowing you are a kid toucher is that the pope in a mind-blowing speech 
[02:16:00]  he told them don't touch kids and said that now uh these priests priests are going to be reported  that's what's going to happen put on a report huh we'll show you let's see how many parents groups  are getting active with that yeah yeah and opi and anthony are terrible they make fun of pedophiles  get active still dragging your kids in yeah you dummies well uh this is just the first thing you're  going to see the victims uh becoming the accused for abuse how do you blame a six-year-old 
[02:16:30]  and his parents for the negligence that causes a priest to touch a child well i have an answer for  that you do jimmy it's probably one we sure don't want to hear the advertisers might get nervous you  little faggot relax relax well that seems to be um how they're starting so they're going to blame the  kid for being naive yeah blame the kid and the parent like what are they going to say the parent 
[02:17:00]  bringing the child there is negligent yeah what is that horrible uh this bernard f law should just  be uh thrown out it's like uh telling the zookeeper he's negligent for bringing the gazelle into the  the lion's cage yeah the parents i could see being held for negligence because they are awful if you're  still bringing your kid to a priest you're a negligent stupid parent you're right you should if if  i were a parent i would never leave a child alone with a priest no good ever ever you're insane 
[02:17:30]  right you're just leaving them there with a potential predator because like i've said in the  past it's all very nice and well to imagine that a priest had this calling to god and he's so strong  in his convictions that he has sworn off sex and is just there for the good of mankind the truth of  the matter is you if you don't if you're a guy and you're so screwed up maybe you're gay or whatever 
[02:18:00]  it is and you don't want uh any ah from the women uh but you can't handle your gayness you join the  priesthood is what you do you join the priesthood that's why you're there and then you start seeing  some of these lovely youngsters walking around these lovely tussleable haired youngsters it probably all  starts with a tussle and yeah i'm sure it does hey thanks for lighting that candle good job good  job with the wine you brought me the wine tussle tussle tussle tussle clip that hair it's below the 
[02:18:30]  ear right and before you know it they're uh predators predators and gay people are getting mad  say well it's not just to get yes it is you know you're straight man regardless of how old the  chicks they're banging are don't drink out of mules stupid it's the gay ones and i'm not against gay  people fine i like gay people of course it's for me waka waka but don't be defensive he's right  don't be defensive about it well it's not just the gay priest yes it is it's 95 of them are gay 
[02:19:00]  priests there is something not right with a guy that is heterosexual swearing himself off of women for for  life knowing that because of the occupation you chose you will never have the joy of a woman that's  not right in the head there's no guy that because of some story written a thousand a couple of thousand  years ago about some invisible man uh that has all kinds of powers that you will write off sex ain't 
[02:19:30]  natural so you're probably gay right but then just go out to the gay bars find yourself a boyfriend  suck a mule whatever it takes but oh now you you can't you can't because that ain't right  that ain't right so what do you do you join the priesthood and do it under the cover of the church  where you know you can get away with it i mean that's what happens yes can i interrupt you because 
[02:20:00]  i just got a message from nicole uh yes my secret weapon phil for my my softball team right will be  uh unavailable for the big celebrity softball because he uh he just had surgery he did on the dl he's on  the dl not good news coming in rotator cuff i don't know oh boy it might be no i think it's a knee this  time around the knee injury hey uh we got a john valby song about the priest it's oh yeah it's a little 
[02:20:30]  rough around the edges man ah you know how valby is it's a little rough at least he's still drinking  not like tom at least he has some energy so we say this to you tools out there that are going to be  offended just turn off the goddamn radio right now do it now do it now and then you won't be offended  okay look i'm telling you don't quote it out of context i think they should be and send the letter  to the washington posted yeah bag ass it didn't happen douche forgot about that guy oh there's a 
[02:21:00]  guy uh he decided to start a little uh writing letter campaign yeah takes a quote while we were  discussing middle school confessions we actually i believe it was a quote from the goddamn show and he  puts it in quotation marks like we said it you see word you see a letter writing campaign yeah  good that's that's what cowards do because what happens is their little voices have never meant  anything so instead of doing something like writing about the priest or doing something where people 
[02:21:30]  are abusing kids they go after entertainment because they're cowards and they were never heard  because the priests listen to this show and they touch children of course of course we  that's what happened we had parents on talking about their kids and their concerns it was a  it was a great discussion it was a pretty uh heavy day man it was pretty raw it was uh interesting  this ass takes a couple lines out of context and uh and starts writing letters to everybody write  your letters you joke and it should be made fun of by the way and i like to make fun of stuff like 
[02:22:00]  that you know why because i'm not the animal committing the acts worry about the people who are committing  the acts stupid you mean nothing bag of jizz that's all he is an overprotective dirtbag parent whose  kids are getting away from him and he's trying to make a difference there you go douche telling all  his friends what he did i wrote a you know what i did it started with a simple letter shut up kill  yourself kill yourself little voice finally heard yeah the squeaky wheel gets the grease 
[02:22:30]  and so do your kids if you bring them to church all right dumbbells with that let's uh play the john  valvey song a little rough little rough around the edges folks  i just played up in boston about a month ago  father pedophilia takes up a kid in the vestibule after the mass 
[02:23:00]  he presses his ass  later that evening corners an altar boy in the confessional booth baptizes his tooth  all those catholic perverts where do they all come from

[02:29:30]  yeah and a man in my right well exactly all right  and a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous  you know it's obvious the guy was throwing this lady a bone she's in a bad situation and look she  turns it on him you know what it's uh yeah she she goes there she's seeing schlong she's probably  getting all worked up with a little bachelorette friends and whatnot and uh the guy figures he's  going to do her a favor she's going to be the one that gets pulled up on the stage right and she's 
[02:30:00]  the cripple girl she's cripple getting damp between the legs that don't open oh can i uh can i  interrupt yes on a slight tangent there may be a new character on our show uh laura orban is checking  it uh laura hey what's up guys it's laura act act act act act hey laura i was wondering if in the  celebrity softball game i could put the softball inside my slit and shoot it out in the catcher's  mid as a first pitch act act act act act act act lord knows enough big black seeds have been inside 
[02:30:30]  that's what act act act act act act act act push hard until i bleed it's laura right yeah see that was  laura she wants to uh throw out the first pitch with her slit as she so eloquently put it did that  make the error it should i hope so we don't know what that means right of course we don't know what  it means you don't dump out of it yes she wants to throw the uh the first pitch in a very unusual way 
[02:31:00]  at our celebrity softball game tickets go on sale wednesday by the way okay uh the strippers lawyer  says he expects his client to be found innocent anthony this is great picture this if you will  like really work it up there's the strip club you know what these things are it's like a a audience  full of women whipped up into a frenzy because there's a guy with a g-string on his ass showing  right there norton and a big mule in the front then he slips it out of the g-string and the the 
[02:31:30]  bag every so often flaps it around in the chick's face and they scream and holler and you keep pounding  and pounding you don't go sometimes it goes away sometimes you don't go away and uh they get all  worked up open yeah so he looks down and um i don't know like the dancing in the dark video with  bruce he grabs her from the audience pulls her up on stage with those turn up legs let's drink to 
[02:32:00]  your legs he pulls up uh he pulls the 42 year old disabled woman pulls her on the stage this is  great holding her dress above her waist and holding her face down on stage while fondling her so he  pulls her dress over her uh hips right and then pins her face down on the stage like holds her face  there and just starts doing things and a word of advice if you want to do this put on a mask and do 
[02:32:30]  it in an alley trust me there's no problems don't do it in public well now uh the woman was very upset  she filed charges he could be convicted of sexual battery and face up to 10 years in prison could you  picture this happening you know in a male strip club like with females can you pick this is why women  have still looked at us stop groveling can you picture a guy or did she hold me down and shut up  that's why you're in there oh you stupid no-legged whore can you only wish if you're a guy going into a 
[02:33:00]  strip club because you know how it is you don't touch the chicks it's nothing you get nothing you sit  there and look right like you're strapped into a chair even if you're getting a lap dance don't touch  don't touch nothing or some biker will throw you out on your head yep but then uh the chick look at  that the chicks go to to see the guys they're getting pulled up on the stage and uh diddled it  says here the woman now alleges that she struggled to get away and was eventually pulled from the  stage by a friend just picture slithering there like a snake oh just laying on the floor tom from new
