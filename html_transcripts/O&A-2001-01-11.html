<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a raucous discussion about a woman flashing her breasts during a live outdoor segment.  This segued into a conversation about *Temptation Island*, followed by a listener's call concerning his girlfriend's sister's herpes outbreak, prompting a detailed, graphic explanation of the virus from a doctor.  The hosts then launched into a listener contest for a trip to the WWF Royal Rumble, with entries escalating into increasingly outrageous sexual acts proposed by callers, including a pair of cousins planning oral sex (“kissing cousins”) and other explicit suggestions involving bananas.  Sandy Kane was mentioned as a potential future guest.  Opie recounted a story about using a paper-writing service while in college in Geneseo, New York, setting the stage for the next segment.

The show continued with further anecdotes about this "coach" who ran a paper-writing service for Geneseo students, detailing how paper quality varied based on the student's claimed academic standing. Callers shared their experiences, including one who failed despite a well-written paper due to professor suspicion. The downfall of the coach due to plagiarism was also discussed.  The conversation then veered to two female callers, Dana and Laura, who graphically described themselves, leading to a joke about a “Voyeur banana milkshake.”  The hosts then discussed the turmoil at their radio station, WNEW, and the possibility of changing the call letters to WONA, after discovering a small station in Winona, Mississippi, already using those letters.

A substantial portion of the broadcast involved a phone conversation with Susie, owner of the Mississippi station Hog 95 WONA ("Making Bacon on the Hog").  Susie described her station, its programming ("The Make and Bacon Show"), its high local ratings, its daily obituary broadcasts, and its role in emergency broadcasting, along with her morning host’s absence due to deer hunting.  Opie and Anthony bantered with Susie, referencing their own outrageous on-air antics, including a previous incident involving flashed breasts on the Today show, and joking about potentially buying the WONA call letters.  The conversation included discussions of the Mississippi flag controversy and plans to send a staff member, Stinky, on a cross-country hitchhiking trip to visit the station, along with Black Earl.  The conversation became increasingly vulgar and sexually suggestive, focusing on past stunts and future interactions with Susie.

The next segment centered on Stinky's upcoming trip, beginning with another call from Susie, filled with sexually suggestive remarks and discussions about local views on race and homosexuality.  Her accent became a comedic element. After playing a local news segment on a state flag vote, the hosts launched into more offensive jokes. The show then focused on arranging Stinky's trip, soliciting listener offers for rides, many with humorous conditions and additional “gifts.”  The logistics were discussed at length, including potential stops and tracking methods.  Audio clips of Stinky interacting with his driver were played. A brief discussion of an XFL ad and the “kissing cousins” failing to appear followed.  A call-in segment concluded this part, with listeners sharing their “lessons” learned from the broadcast, reinforcing the offensive themes and jokes.

The show concluded with a call-in segment where listeners shared humorous and often nonsensical takeaways from the broadcast, ranging from observations about Mississippi to a new game, "Where's Stinky?".  The hosts discussed scheduling conflicts and the future of a female radio personality at the station, speculating on her “options” following a recently released book.  Vulgar and offensive language continued, including calling a listener a "skank twat." The show ended with promotion of an upcoming show and a contest to win Jim Brewer tickets. No guests were explicitly identified as in-studio during this final segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the line, which I hear you've had a little fun with.  We had a lot of fun with it. Did that shock you?  You know what it was? We were outside, and if you've seen the 8.30 in the show every morning,  the camera pans the crowd outside, and what I do is, since I can't see where the camera is sometimes,  I look at the monitor, and I'm standing there, it happened to be with Ann Curry.  Katie was in Philadelphia at the time, and I'm looking at the monitor, and I see the people go by,  and normally, you know, hi, mom, hey, Kansas, go Jayhawks, and all of a sudden,  the camera goes by, and this woman looks at the camera and goes...  And my first thought was it was one of those kind of like plastic pieces that you wear on Halloween, 
[00:00:30]  you know, that they weren't real.  They might have been, yeah, when you think about it.  And then after like 45 seconds of staring at it, I said, you know, those are real.  And, you know, she had written the word wow on her stomach, which apparently is, you know,  W.O.W. stands for the stupid radio station promotion in New York called Whip Them Out Wednesdays.  And so she whipped them out.  Well, it's not a stupid promotion anymore. They just got a lot of publicity.  I think it actually said powwow, but gravity had covered the, uh...  Really?  The top word.  Oh!  But what's weird about it is, think about this lady. 
[00:01:00]  At some point during her day, that day, she had to get in front of a mirror and say,  yeah, these are ready for national television.  And I've got to be honest with you, speak as one boob man to another,  these were not that great.  I mean, I've seen a lot better boobs than these.  And yet she exposes them on a morning show.  But you know what's good in, what, six years of having the outdoor studio?  I think that's the first, there was one other little weird thing,  but that's the first time anyone has, you know, gone...  Don't say that now.  But, you know, we have...  Most of the people are great. 
[00:01:30]  They're very wholesome people.  You will never see a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  One, oh, two, seven.  We'll see you.  W-N-E-W.  Well.  Well.  Well.  Well.  Hey, everybody, we're all going to get laid.  Oh, you're very naughty.  You're a wretched butcher. 
[00:02:00]  Is she happy with her large boobs?  Well.  Okay, terrific.  Shut up, dummy.  Walk it off.  Shut up, dummy.  Quiet.  I hope this isn't out of line, but you do have beautiful breasts.  Shut up.  Stop. 
[00:02:30]  Well, who made you pull for this stuff, huh?  Looks like Chuck's going to put the hot dog in the bun.  I'm pissed off, Rick.  How are you?  Okay.  You're a filthy whore.  Oh.  Oh.  Eh, eh, eh.  Oh.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it. 
[00:03:00]  Oh.  Go to sleep, crazy lady.  Oh.  I don't play it.  Don't you have homes?  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I don't play it.  I'm bad at you.  Oh.  Oh.  I don't play it.  Oh.  Eh, eh, eh.  Oh.  Eh, eh, eh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:03:30]  Ow.  Oh.  Ow.  Oh.  Ow.  Eh, eh, eh.  Akusa.  Spear checker.  Greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've heard him all over the world.  I'm Big Dick Black.  Dion.  Dina.  Dina.  All right.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, what's going on?  You got kind of caught up in that.  Yeah, I did a little remix there for you.  Yeah, we like to do that from time to time.  There you have it.  Sandy Kane. 
[00:04:00]  Hour two of the O.P. and Anthony broadcast going another nine hours today.  Are we?  Yeah.  My God.  I don't know what we're going to do at seven today.  I was thinking of maybe inviting some homeless people up here to do a radio show.  Now, that would be interesting.  We should do that.  Can we get Ziggy to do the 7-Eleven shift today?  Yeah, we're going to sing, silent night, holy night.  If we get a bunch of homeless people up here, then we would have to stick around, though.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  Someone would have to supervise them.  Supervise.  Why?  Some of the other people weren't supervised.  Good point.  Just throw some homeless on the air.  Who cares?  What are you reading?  Well, there's still a couple of leftovers from the subject.  The Temp Island subject that we started to show off.  The Asian Island.  Yes.  Michael, what's going on?  Well, you know, basically the premise of the island there is what they're doing is separating the couples as they come to the island. 
[00:05:00]  And they don't talk to each other until they leave.  So they get to see it on videotape at the end.  Yeah, I was reading about it today in the paper.  It seems that the four couples that are on this island, the first day, get to spend together.  Then they get to look at all the guys and girls that are going to be there to try to bone the people in the couple.  And for the guys, they can pick one of the guys that they don't want their girl to even be with or date or anything. 
[00:05:30]  So if you see a ringer there, hey, man.  So it's like hands off.  Yeah, that guy is hands off.  And the girls can do the same.  Right.  For your partner, you get to choose one of the people and kind of knock them out.  You know, you can't try to pick up on their significant other.  Then they separate them.  Girls on one side of the island, the guys on the other.  And they try to, they date the guys and the guys date the girls.  They have activities and stuff.  They go out, activities. 
[00:06:00]  And I'm sure a lot of it involves late night drinking and whatnot.  And you're able to listen to tape recordings and watch videos of the various singles discussing their dates with some of the ladies.  Now, if you choose not to view the videos of your significant other and the date she was on, then she doesn't have to view yours.  That's how it works.  Sort of a way to contain the pain, I guess, if the guy's talking about, yeah, well, I was slamming her in the back door. 
[00:06:30]  It was great.  Well, it sounds like it's going to be a great show.  But it hit the paper today.  They have a little problem with the show.  One couple raising a toddler misled producers about their family situation and made the final cut as one of the four sets of contestants.  It was a big mess that a Fox worker involved in the show's videotaping and editing.  He says the couple made it onto the island resort of Belize and into about five days worth of shooting before producers realized their background check had fallen short and they'd been scammed. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Because they didn't want any couples that had kids or anything because they didn't really want to break up real, real families with kids and stuff.  Yeah, you don't want to end up making a poor kid from a broken home.  But let me tell you something.  If the parents of the kid are willing to go on this island and do this, the kid's effed anyway.  I'm hearing we have audio already of one of the guys in the couples watching the video of his girlfriend. 
[00:07:30]  Turn it off.  Oh, no.  What's happening?  Turn it off.  Oh, there she is.  Bikini's off.  Turn it off.  Oh, no.  Two guys.  Three.  What's that?  Turn it off.  Oh.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Please.  Please.  She looked like she's coming with clam chowder.  Oh, God.  We're going to have to all check out Temptation Island. 
[00:08:00]  It's on tonight, right?  I did not.  Tonight at 9?  Tonight at 9.  Obviously, we're going to have to do a check that out.  On Phlox.  Phlox!  Phlox and friends.  Hey, Mike.  What's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Yeah.  Hey, you're...  Listen, we got to keep this double dose every night going.  I love it.  Of what?  Of O&A?  Oh, O&A.  Double dose.  Yeah, we'll be on until 11 once again today.  Awesome.  I don't know...  Keep it going.  You guys rule.  All right.  Thank you.  I don't know what we're going to do tonight.  I think we're going to try to, you know, get together a show filled with some of our wacky 
[00:08:30]  guests.  Yeah.  That would mean a replay of a Sandy Kane appearance, probably.  Eh, eh.  I'm bleeding.  She wants to come back on the show, by the way.  She gave us...  Yeah, she sent a card.  A Christmas card.  I don't bleed.  Ow!  That one's great.  Ow!  You might remember that.  We had a listener come in and put Preparation H on her hemorrhoid.  Right.  And he might have done it a little too hard.  Oh!  Oh! 
[00:09:00]  That's one.  Here's another one.  I don't bleed.  And he has the best.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Eh, eh, eh.  We got to get her in just to get more Sandy Kane sounds.  Yeah.  You know?  But I think a Sandy Kane appearance will make the show tonight.  The second Opie and Anthony show of the day.  Starting at 7 o'clock.  Right, Rick?  We got a Sandy Kane moment, don't we?  Oh, yeah.  We need the last appearance.  You want the Brian Regan one?  Yeah, with the hemorrhoid and I was screaming and yelling.  Yeah, without a doubt. 
[00:09:30]  So, that should be a lot of fun.  Hey, Jay, what's going on?  Hey.  Jay?  Yeah.  What's up, man?  Turn that radio down.  All right, I got it, man.  It's off.  All right, what's going on?  Nothing.  What's up?  You called us.  I have a little medical question for you.  Yeah.  All right, my girlfriend and her sister just got back from Cancun.  She was there for 10 days.  Uh-oh.  She had these bumps and crap on her face.  What?  And she had these bumps and crap on her face, man.  It was real nasty.  She went to the doctor.  I was over at her house the other day. 
[00:10:00]  I saw a prescription for Valtrex.  Aw.  Hold on.  Aw.  Yeah.  That is herpes medication.  Aw.  Yeah, I realized that.  Wait, wait, wait.  Slow down.  I saw the commercial for that before the show today.  That hot piece of ass chick.  Yeah, driving around that Bronco with the top on?  Yeah, driving around.  It looks like she's going cross-country, and she's so happy and smiling because her herpes  are under control because of Valtrex.  Valtrex.  Yeah, but she's got the big bump.  I'm a skank whore, and I have the herp, but that's okay. 
[00:10:30]  I got Valtrex.  How bad do you need to make it in Hollywood that you would do the herpes commercials?  Obviously pretty bad.  It's like Jay's bit about the AIDS commercial guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, and now they get, you see the one guy on the commercial now for that, what's a commercial  for, pancreatic cancer?  I don't think it's a commercial for pancreatic cancer.  I think they're trying to cure it, but he has AIDS, and he's talking about getting a  cure for pancreatic cancer because he has had AIDS for a while, and it's okay. 
[00:11:00]  He's fine.  If that isn't telling me AIDS is cured, I don't know what is, but he's saying that the pancreatic  cancer is what's going to kill him, right?  No, he doesn't even have it.  Oh, he's just, no, he's just trying to help people out.  There's a guy with AIDS trying to help out the people with pancreatic cancer.  A guy with FBA.  FBA.  Spokesperson for pancreatic cancer.  Yeah.  Nice.  A little ironic, but I watch it and just go, wow, AIDS is done.  All right, so where does your girlfriend have the herpes?  It's not my girlfriend.  It's her sister, but here's the thing. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  They still live together, and they shower together.  Now, like, they use the same towels and soap and crap.  But, you know, can I possibly get this?  I'm a little bit nervous.  Should I give her the can now?  You know, give her a cup?  I think we need to get a doctor on the line.  I don't think you could get the herpes that way.  I don't know.  I know it's very easily transmitted.  I'm just getting a little nervous here.  Well, what, are you kissing her and everything?  Not her sister.  Her, yeah, but I'm worried about her getting it.  Then I get it.  I don't even walk around with these bubbles on my face.  Yeah, the girl he's kissing doesn't have the herpes, but the sister does. 
[00:12:00]  The sister.  And what, she's got bubbles all over her face?  Oh, it's nasty, man.  The big puss wads.  Like, it's really disgusting.  Puss and everything?  Come on.  What did she get?  I don't know what it is, but I mean, it's all over.  Oh, man.  It's not just, like, little blisters.  I mean, there's some funky colored crap coming out of them.  Green and yellow.  Like, yeah, something you see in the movies.  Well, keep listening to the show.  We'll get a doctor on the line to see how you get the herbs. 
[00:12:30]  If you get herpes sharing soap and stuff.  That'd be wonderful.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  Speaking of herpes, I don't know if the kissing cousins are coming in today.  Oh, please.  Who even thought that was happening?  Let's just put it on the table.  I think they're backing out.  I don't want to, like, fool anyone.  I don't want to tease it for the next three hours and they don't show up.  But it's not looking good with the cousins.  Anybody.  That have made out before or kissed or whatever.  Yeah, a little kissing experiment.  They have swapped spit.  The one girl wants to go to New Orleans for the WWF Royal Rumble really bad. 
[00:13:00]  So she came up with this thing yesterday that she would be eating the peach of her cousin, right?  Yep.  Yeah.  The cousin a little nervous.  But by the end of the show, it was looking good.  Yeah.  Now today, Rick's been on the phone all morning and early afternoon and talked to the guy, the boyfriend.  We've heard this old gag before.  Oh, please.  It's just not looking good.  No, it doesn't look good right now.  It ain't gonna happen.  Doesn't look good. 
[00:13:30]  I've been talking to the boyfriend.  He's working on her because the girl, the cousin that's going to have it done to her, she's the skittish one.  So the boyfriend's working on it because, you know, he wants to see it, of course.  He's a guy.  So he's still working on her.  The other cousin, the cousin that wants to do it to her, is working on her.  And I've got more calls that are, we're trading phone calls back and forth trying to get this girl in here.  Well, you know what?  Why don't we get the one girl that's really into it on the air?  I'm still waiting to hear back from her.  I just left her a message.  I can't even hear from her.  Well, call her back and say, open air to one and talk to you immediately. 
[00:14:00]  All right.  And give her the special number.  And if she's listening, give us a call, okay?  Because we've got to give away this trip to the Royal Rumble in New Orleans.  Either way.  The Royal Rumble.  I guess game is on again.  Looking for the wildest thing you would do to go down to New Orleans for a few days with a guest to see the WWF Royal Rumble.  Something outrageous.  Come in here and freak us out.  I know the eat the peach thing is great.  We had a guy on the line yesterday who wanted to get his junk tattooed.  Oh, that's nothing.  A guy said that he wants to get a Prince Albert. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, man.  That's where you pierce the schween right through its natural piercing and out the bottom.  Yeah.  He said he would get one of those live on our show to win the trip.  How the hell do you take it?  It must just go.  It's bad enough just trying to take a leak in the toilet without it spraying all over the place sometimes.  Wake up in the morning, you're bouncing off the walls.  Yeah, I hit your pants. 
[00:15:00]  Imagine having one of those.  You've got to sit down like a chick.  We've got some herpes advice on the line here.  Oh, thank God.  Look at all the shows that were bashing us today.  Yeah, we suck so bad that all these shows have to talk about us.  Enough.  Imus was bashing us again.  Yeah, they're a bunch of wussies.  Whatever. 
[00:15:30]  Wussies.  Moby Worm coming to get you, baby.  317, Imus in the morning show.  Quack, quack.  He wants to talk about wussies.  Now, shut up, Bernard, you jerk.  When he was in the biggest battle of his life, what did he do?  Nothing.  He laid down and cried in the fetal position.  I hid under my huge fag cowboy hat and bandana.  I need some ratings again, so I'm going to wear that oxygen mask deal thing. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, shut up, jerk.  I don't think he should be calling us wusses.  Yeah, we're wussies.  When it came to battling, he was the worst, and he knows it.  That's true.  He knows it, too.  That's all right.  He likes talking about us.  I don't care.  Christine.  Hi, Janine.  Janine from Jersey.  It says Christine.  Hi, Janine.  How are you?  I'm good, thanks.  First time caller.  I love you guys. 
[00:16:30]  You're one of those health educators?  Yes, I am.  What, in high school or something?  Middle school, actually.  Middle school.  Yes, you're actually doing a unit on communicable diseases and sick.  Oh, wow.  Shaping the mind.  All right, slow down, Janine.  It's okay.  You do sex ed in middle school?  Middle school, yeah.  And in what area?  You don't have to say the school, but like what area?  Sure.  Well, Bergen County.  Oh, right.  And what are the ages of middle school these days?  Like 12 to 15?  Yeah.  11 to 15?  Well, we're 6th, 7th, and 8th. 
[00:17:00]  6th, 7th, and 8th.  Okay.  Yeah.  Anyway, herpes is one of the, like, most highly contagious sexually transmitted, well,  not only sexually transmitted, but it can be, you can get it through touching, kissing,  lipstick.  John may notice his penis is getting larger.  Mary is throwing hair on her body where she didn't have hair before.  You show those films?  Yeah.  I love those films.  Those films sucked.  This is the time where grooming and hygiene becomes most important for the adolescent. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  All right, so you could get herpes from what?  Sharing lipstick, and what else?  Kissing, towels, touching.  Towels.  Wow, this guy, the guy that called in is screwed.  Yeah.  Well, not that he's screwed, but he really needs to be careful because it's highly contagious.  The stats on it are like 6 out of 10 people, you know, could have it.  That's outrageous.  The stats on young Mary.  She is but 12 years old and already growing. 
[00:18:00]  Wow.  Hey, how do you teach the kids about sex?  Are you allowed to say stuff?  Because I know they're getting pretty PC in the public schools these days.  Yeah.  No, you have to be careful.  You know, abstinence is everything, so.  Oh, is that what you teach?  Yeah.  But how do you explain it?  Well, you know, you go through, like, basic anatomy and physiology, and you have to be very  politically correct, and, you know.  Hold on.  A doctor's saying you're full of S.  Can't make it sound good.  John the doctor.  Okay.  John the doctor.  What's up? 
[00:18:30]  Hi.  This woman is correct, but she's referring to when a person breaks out.  Yes.  Then it's highly contagious.  Okay, but that's what the problem was when the guy called.  He said the girlfriend's sister has bubbles all over her face with pasta and stuff already.  Yes, yes.  There are two types of herpes.  There's type 1 and type 2.  Type 1 is the one where you have on your mouth.  It's called above the waist.  Nice.  Type 2 is below the waist. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  You know, that's the one everybody's really worried about.  Hey, if you have type 1 and you get a, if a girl has type 1 and you get a Hummer, can you get type 2?  Uh, no, no, no, no, no, no, type 1 is different from type 2, but now they're being entered, they're being interchanged now because of, uh, can I, uh, or, can I say that?  You're a doctor.  You can say anything.  It's just like the MTV thing where they show boobs.  That's right.  Through oral, uh, encounters.  Through oral encounters, you could exchange.  Right, right.  One. 
[00:19:30]  Right.  Those, herpes one is the cold sore, type 1, the one you get on the lips.  Swamp lip.  Here's a lot of things that people don't know, and I'm not even sure of this.  If someone has the lip herpes, the simple one that you put the, uh, Campo Phenique on or something, I don't know, and, and somebody that has this on their lip gives a Hummer, can the person get the, the genital herpes?  Not the genital herpes per se, but, uh, um, I'm not sure if you see the type 1.  They're getting, it's difficult to tell, uh, between the two, but they, you're supposed to avoid contact when a person is breaking out, period. 
[00:20:00]  Uh, I don't, if, if you're, uh...  Like a plastic bubble.  Not watching out, then, uh, it's your fault.  All right, hold on, uh...  But, you know, even if you have sex, can I see it, though?  Yes, if you get involved with somebody using a condom, and the person does, has an outbreak, you can still get it on other areas of your body, per se.  Oh, really?  On your thigh, on your, on, on other parts of the body. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, nice.  God damn, that rocks.  But an outlet is good, because it prevents the outbreak significantly.  All right, hold on, Jay, uh, that started this whole discussion, uh, wants to ask the doctor something.  Jay.  Hey, here, guys.  Here you go, you got a doctor.  Hey, doctor, I'm just wondering, if, if this does spread to my girlfriend, would I know it right away?  Would I notice if I picked it up right away?  Okay, if you get involved with somebody that has an outbreak, okay, say they have the outbreak with the, you know, the, uh, the, uh, the herpes outbreak on their area, and you have, uh, unprotected sex with this individual, you will notice the period is three to five days on average, mostly about a week max, then you will start experiencing the, the so-called blisters. 
[00:21:00]  Oh.  Within, within a week max.  Well, well, no, well, that's the genital herpes, correct?  Yes.  What about on the mouth?  I mean, because I've seen colds or, you know, that you put the camp of, you know, whatever these guys were saying, you put on, it goes away in a couple days or a week, whatever. 
[00:21:30]  Now, what she has isn't just a blister or a sore, and this is like, wow, what are you going to do about that?  You know, cut your head off or something.  And I want to know that, you know, like, again, this isn't my girlfriend.  This is my girlfriend's sister.  And she came home from her trip with this clap all over her face.  Now, I want to know that I don't have it now.  I haven't been in contact with her.  I haven't even, I haven't been staying away from this girl.  I don't even want to look at her.  She makes me sick looking at her.  Yeah, there you go.  I want to make sure, you know, if I don't have anything now, you think I'm pretty good? 
[00:22:00]  Um, well, I really don't know what the stuff is on her face, so I would have to look at it.  It could be other things.  No, she went to the doctor, and all I know is she came back with Valtrex.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, if he's giving her Valtrex, then she has type 2, the genital one.  Aww.  She has it on her face?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because type 1, there's no medication for type 1. 
[00:22:30]  It's just a cold one.  You should give her the care permit, huh?  But Jay, that's your girlfriend's sister.  Yeah, but I want to make sure she didn't get it from the towels.  I mean, they share makeup and crap like that.  You want to make sure the herpes didn't jump to your girlfriend.  It might.  I mean, put it this way.  You say within a week, you'd know if you'd pick something up?  Absolutely.  Herpes is within a week.  All right.  Thank God.  I too. 
[00:23:00]  I too.  I mean, all the herpes, I should know within a week, I should pick something up, right?  All right.  Well, yeah, you would start breaking out within a week.  Okay.  So I should be pretty good now.  I should just cam this whole family and never talk to them again.  Yeah.  I would stay away from the bubble face.  Bubble face.  All right, guys.  All right.  Thank you, Jay.  You're welcome.  Doc, we have another lady that wants to ask you something, all right?  All right.  Hold on a minute, okay?  Joey Big Arms quickly saying, I cannot keep up with WNEW.  Love Lines is now on the two to seven spot. 
[00:23:30]  I learned something today already.  What?  Herpes.  Mm-mm, good.  Ah.  If she had all that going on in her face from herpes, man, imagine what that guy's sack  looked like.  Damn.  Tammy.  Hello.  You're on with the doc.  How are you?  We're talking about herpes today.  I know.  Very interesting topic.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  I get swamp mouth a lot.  Swamp lips?  Swamp lips?  Swamp lips, sure.  Right.  Very attractive, I know.  I have a question for the doctor, though. 
[00:24:00]  If a guy eats my peach, right, and then comes up and kisses my lip, and I get swamp lip,  does that mean that I have, you know, down...  Oh, genital herpes?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Well, where's the doctor?  He's right here.  I thought you were asking me.  Anthony, do it now.  The only time, the time where herpes can be spread is when a person has an outbreak.  Right. 
[00:24:30]  I don't have an outbreak down there, because you would know if you had an outbreak down  there, wouldn't you?  Yes.  The first time you have an outbreak, it's extremely painful and itchy, and it burns, and you will  definitely know.  Nice.  And, uh...  Well, I don't have that.  Well, maybe...  Huh.  That's bizarre.  Because, you know, sometimes, if I go and, um...  Hob the knob?  Yeah.  Hob the knob.  Yeah.  Sometimes I'll get it.  Oh, you will?  Yeah.  Wait, sometimes you'll get what?  The swamp lip?  I get the swamp lip from hobbing the knob. 
[00:25:00]  Oh.  Like, people at my office know I've hobbed knob over the weekend if I come in on Tuesday  with a swamp lip.  Tammy has a genital herpes.  Well, every time, I mean, it's not...  If a person has the herpes, and then you go, and then you do the activity, and you get  it, and then it goes away, it's not going to keep coming every time you do the activity.  Not that...  But, like, if I, if I hob a knob of somebody who doesn't have it, and then I get it...  That's pure coincidence.  Yeah, I was going to say that.  Oh, okay, coincidence. 
[00:25:30]  Tammy, how many knobs are you hobbing?  I've hobbed a few knobs.  Yeah?  In my day.  Well, then you're just...  But now I try to hob only one knob.  But it's...  When you're hobbing a knob...  A knob a day keeps the herpes away.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Great, Doc.  When I hob the knob...  Yes, Anthony?  When I hob...  Yeah, when you hob the knob, have you ever hob the knob with the swamp lip?  No.  You never hob the knob with the swamp lip.  All right.  That's good.  That's right.  That's true.  Nice.  Yeah.  No.  Because then the knob will get swamped. 
[00:26:00]  Like guys who care.  Swamp knob.  I don't care.  What are the odds?  Whatever.  I think it's...  I think you get swamp lip from stress.  Yeah, most of the time.  That's true.  That is true.  Right.  Thank you, Tammy.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Take care.  Doc, I think we're done with you and the herpes discussion.  Well, thank you.  And good luck to all.  For Tammy, it's the stress of, is he going to see in my mouth?  It's a little stress there.  All right.  All right, John.  Well, thank you.  Thank you.  There he goes.  The herpes doctor.  Very nice. 
[00:26:30]  Let's take a break.  God damn education.  We'll take a break and we'll talk about rotting balloon knots next.  Oh, there's another cousin that wants to eat the peach.  Wow.  Yo Salama.  Right here.  Hello.  Hello.  Yo Salama.  Hi.  Hi.  What's going on?  Is that your name?  Yo Salinda.  Yo Salima.  Yo Salinda.  What?  Yo Salinda.  Yo Salinda.  Yep.  All right.  So what's going on?  Oh, Jocelyn.  Thank you for my name. 
[00:27:00]  Hey, get the guy on the phone.  The guy that speaks English.  I do speak English.  That's not fair.  Do speak English.  She's speaking good.  Do you speak English?  Now.  Yes?  Yes.  Yes.  Do you, um, you have a cousin?  Yeah.  And you will be willing to eat her peach?  Yeah, please.  Sure.  It doesn't sound...  If she wants to.  No.  That's another phony. 
[00:27:30]  If she wants to.  No, I'm not phony.  All right.  I'm not phony.  I do whatever.  All right.  Well, then call the cousin up and set it up and call us back, okay?  Yes.  Please.  Hold on.  Um, what happened?  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Hello?  Oh!  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Hello?  No.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  What?  You got any subjection.  You son of a bitch. 
[00:28:00]  We're still trying to get the cousin on the phone from yesterday's show.  It ain't gonna happen.  It ain't gonna happen.  Someone said that doctor sounded like the doctor from Cannonball Run.  I'd like to probe her case.  He's shooting up.  Liz, what's going on?  Hi.  Hi.  Yeah.  You're a dermatologist?  I'm a dermatologist.  You can get herpes without having a flare-up.  You could get herpes with...  You can...  If you have sex with a partner who has herpes, even though it's not flaring up, they can pass 
[00:28:30]  it to you.  Okay.  Absolutely.  Obviously, she was suffering from certain delirious germemia.  Liz, is it rare, though, or...?  It's not...  I mean, it's not that common, but it can definitely happen.  And you can get type 1 on your penis.  Totally.  You can.  Yeah, if you have swamp lip, and you're giving somebody a hummer, and you've got type 1 on  your lip, you can definitely get it.  You can get type 1 or type 2 anywhere.  Anywhere. 
[00:29:00]  So you could spread your swamp lip to the junk to make it swamp junk.  Totally, yeah, but you know how it comes back, like every now and again, it comes back?  I just...  I just...  Yeah.  I just came up with my screen name for opianthony.com.  Oh, someone's gonna take it now.  Swamp junk.  Swamp junk.  Hey, hey, doctor, doctor.  Yeah.  Now, will this keep coming back on your schwang?  Well, if it's type 2, like the genital type...  No, I mean just the type 1.  It likes the junk, so it'll come back to the junk. 
[00:29:30]  Hey, who doesn't?  If you have type 1 that normally likes the lip on your face, that will actually only come...  It'll come back less often than the type 2 type.  But on your schween, or will you start getting swamp lip, too?  Sure.  You can get recurrent swamp lip on your schween.  Totally.  Oh, man.  It's happy, for God's sake.  God, would that suck, man.  All right.  Thank you, Liz, the dermatologist.  Okay, no problem.  All right.  There she goes.  Froy, the head of the opianthony.com website, is reserving swamp junk just for you. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, good.  Thank you.  I need a name.  I like that one.  Swamp junk.  We'll take one more call, and we'll move on here.  Nasty Walt, what's up?  Yeah, what's up?  I want to know.  You guys suck.  Thank you.  Thank you.  What are you guys doing?  Talking to you.  Let's go.  What do you got?  Yeah, man.  This guy at work, man.  He's sick.  He's in love with this girl.  Keeps giving him the clap.  I mean, it's nasty.  I don't even want to shake his hand no more.  It's a nice guy, but oh, it's disgusting. 
[00:30:30]  There's so many parasites around, man.  Call me naive, but what's the difference between the herp and the clap?  Well, the clap is syphilis or venereal disease or gonorrhea.  What kind of outbreak do you get from the clap?  Well, short term, it'll be stinging when you pee, and then you just take penicillin, and that cures it like it's gone.  I just know.  I've never had it.  Let me go on record as saying I've never had any sexually transmitted disease in my life, but I've known people that have had the clap. 
[00:31:00]  Rick's saying you get some drip, some leakage, but that can be cured.  As a matter of fact, Al Capone, I believe, died of the clap.  You know, all day long, I'm going to give out suggestions for screen names for opianthony.com.  There you go.  Clap drip.  Clap drip.  I am clap drip.  I am clap drip.  I'm a newbie on the opianthony.com message board.  Clap drip.  Swamp junk is mine, but feel free to take clap drip. 
[00:31:30]  Jimmy, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  My first year in college, I started going out with this girl.  I found out from her ex-boyfriend.  She had herpes.  Didn't find out until six months after going out with her.  Nice.  She started getting these things on her lips.  She was like, oh, it's just cold sores, you know?  And I was like, all right, whatever.  I didn't know much about it.  I ended up talking to her ex-boyfriend.  He's like, you know, you're a really good guy.  You'll be an understanding all about that.  I was like, what the hell are you talking about?  He's like, you know, she's got herpes.  I was like, you're kidding me. 
[00:32:00]  So I freaked out.  Oh, oh, oh.  Can't say that S word.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Sorry.  Whoa.  So you looked into it.  I looked into it, and, you know, I haven't got it.  It was like five years ago, but, oh, man, I was so angry.  So you didn't get the bubble face or anything?  I didn't get it, but that was the end of my relationship with her.  Well, maybe it was just the ex trying to get you to leave her alone.  No, no.  She admitted it.  She broke down.  She said she only told, like, to see her mother got it from somebody,  and she got it, like, from, you know, from her mother, just from, you know, 
[00:32:30]  hereditary or whatever.  Yeah.  All right, Jimmy.  All right, thanks.  Thank you.  You got stuck.  Ah, yeah.  That old gag making a comeback.  Amanda.  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey, I know somebody.  The doctor was saying before that the doctors can't find it unless it's outside.  I know someone who went on her routine, and the doctor told her that she had herpes,  and she had no clue.  Oh, because it was kind of internal?  It was, yeah, it was in the tunnel there. 
[00:33:00]  She had bubbles in her peach?  It wasn't that badly broken out, but the doctor was doing an exam, and she did it.  I got a new screen name for anyone who wants it for opianthony.com.  What is it?  Herp Cave.  What about Bubble Peach?  Oh, Bubble Peach.  Bubble Peach is good, but I like Herp Cave.  What is that in there?  What, did she drop a bunch of M&Ms in her lap? 
[00:33:30]  I'm feeling something.  Herp Cave.  All right, okay.  Herp Cave up for grabs on opianthony.com.  Please keep track of all the ones I come up with.  God.  I want to see who grabs them, okay?  What do we have so far?  Clap Trip.  Yeah.  Swamp Junk, which is mine.  Swamp Junk, and I believe...  And Herp Cave.  I believe the Gooch is going to come up with a Sigpick for you.  Great.  This is for Swamp Junk. 
[00:34:00]  Swamp Junk.  Terry, what's going on?  I think you guys have just invented a new language.  Huh.  I just turned my radio on, and I heard a doctor talk about having swamp lip going down on somebody's  drunk.  Junk.  Junk, yes.  I mean, it's like an English to radio dictionary.  Oh, we've been talking in code for years around here.  I tell you, guys, push about the source on this.  This is great.  All right, Terry.  Thank you.  Later.  Bye.  That is rude, man.  Oh, and then Clap Trip, is it? 
[00:34:30]  Herp Cave.  Peach Puss.  Clap Snatch.  Ooze Cave.  Swamp Taco.  Remember the old joke?  I'll just, um, I'll just say the punchline.  I picked the scabs.  Remember that one?  Yeah.  Come on, remember that one?  Yeah.  Hey, are we talking to W-O-N-A today?  Yeah.  From Mississippi?  Who's the name? 
[00:35:00]  Pick the scabs.  Yeah, W-O-N-A is taken somewhere down in, uh, Mississippi.  Mississippi.  They're going to send us some t-shirts that we can give out to our, our, uh, listeners.  Cool.  So, uh, the Royal Rumble trip is still on to New Orleans, WWF, you know?  You know the deal?  Looking for the wildest thing you'll do in studio tomorrow?  Yep.  Uh, the best one tomorrow will win a trip to New Orleans for you and the guests.  It's a great, great prize.  Of course, if the, the, the, the cousins come in and eat the peach, which we're highly doubting  at this point, yeah, then game is over, but, uh... 
[00:35:30]  It's looking bad, though.  It's looking really, really bad.  The, the, the one cousin won't even call us back at this point, so, so, you know.  So, so we'll listen, we'll, we'll listen to your suggestions if you want in on that  trip, okay?  All right.  Let's take a break and we'll continue.  Stay there.  I'm the sweetheart.  And Anthony.  That's the a-hole over there.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  O, W, N, N, N, D, D, D, D, D, W.  And our phone number is 212-757-1027. 
[00:36:00]  Instant feedback coming in from Heiko from Fairfield.  Uh, what's a doctor doing listening to your show, guys?  Shouldn't he be working or something?  Well, we have doctors that listen to us.  We have, uh, stockbrokers and dentists.  You ever wonder?  Yeah.  Who's listening to this show and where they are?  Yeah, you never know.  You never know.  Doctors.  Someone could be committing a murder right now, and they just happen to have us on in the background. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Ever since I saw Reservoir Dogs, I've thought about that.  Oh, and stuck in the middle with you?  Yeah, the guy's getting his ear cut off.  Local radio station playing in the background, and this guy's cutting the guy's ear right off.  If you're listening to us in an unusual circumstance, give us a call today.  Very curious.  I don't give a F what you know or don't know.  Yeah, I don't give a good F what you know or don't know.  I'm going to torture you anyway.  All right, Anthony, let's get to the bottom of the kissing cousin. 
[00:37:00]  It cut off my F in ear.  Such a twisted movie, but I love it.  Cynthia.  Hi, guys.  One half of the kissing cousins, Anthony.  Yes.  I can't believe you guys thought I wasn't calling.  No.  I've been trying for the past half hour.  Your phone's just really busy.  No, we know.  We knew you weren't coming.  It doesn't matter if you're calling.  We want to know if you're coming in to...  Well, that's why I'm calling.  We are coming for sure.  Positive. 
[00:37:30]  So you're coming down with your cousin?  Yes.  And you were able to talk her into it?  Yes.  And you will be eating her peach?  Yes.  For the trip to New Orleans to see the WWF Royal Rumble?  Yep.  What if you blow us off?  Who?  What if you guys blow us off?  Yeah.  I'm on my way to pick her up now from work, and then we're going straight over there.  You're going to shoot over here?  Yes, we are.  We put it this way.  We practiced last night for about a minute or two. 
[00:38:00]  You practiced last night?  Because we were really nervous, and she couldn't believe I did it, so we said, if we can do  it in the privacy of our own bedroom...  So you already did it, so what the hell?  Yeah.  No, but...  Now you might as well, you know, get the tricks out of it.  It's very disgusting.  What?  It's disgusting.  All right, Cynthia.  Yes?  Why...  Yeah.  Sorry, Anthony, I interrupted you.  Why is it disgusting?  Why do you find it disgusting?  It's sick.  It's my cousin.  Blood.  Look, I don't understand this at all. 
[00:38:30]  Look, I just got to ask you.  Are you coming down here?  Yes, we are.  I'm on my way there.  Are you going to be eating your cousin's pizza?  Yes, I am.  They practiced last night, Anthony, and how far did...  It's not wrong, trust me.  It was like a minute, the most.  Was she naked?  No, no, no.  She just pulled her pants down real quick.  That was it.  Nothing else.  Remember, Cynthia, this was your idea.  I know.  I know.  We're sick eps around here, but this one was your idea.  Right.  Because I know how sick you guys are.  All right, here's the deal.  We're going to put you on hold.  We're going to give you a special phone number.  Okay.  We want you calling us every 15 minutes. 
[00:39:00]  Yes.  Remember, we're taking the train.  You got a cell phone?  I know.  What are you calling on right now?  Pay phone.  Can't you hear the trucks and the cars?  Pay phone.  Yep.  You can't get like a cell phone so we can track?  We need to track you guys.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  I can call you every time we're next to a pay phone.  All right.  Call us every time you're next to a pay phone.  We'll get...  I want you guys to know that we are going.  All right.  We'll give you a special number, all right?  Okay.  All right. 
[00:39:30]  Bye.  All right.  See you guys later.  Hold on.  Hold on.  There you go, Anthony.  Yeah.  So now, supposedly, they're showing up.  You know, I don't want to catch the crap from our faithful listeners if they don't know.  I don't either.  So I'm going to have to say, I'm going to go on record and say I'm very skeptical.  But they say they're coming.  So until they don't show, I guess we have to believe them.  Yes, we do.  They'll be here by, what, 6 o'clock?  Yeah, well, I guess so.  All right.  There's a couple other girls on the line here. 
[00:40:00]  Hello?  Laura and Dana, what's going on?  Hi.  Okay.  I think we have a better idea than those two girls.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  My friend Dana offered to shove a...  Holy ass!  Hold on!  Are you insane?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  That's it.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, my.  Do you understand this is radio and we have some rules and regulations we must adhere to?  Let me tell you something.  That sounded really, really hot. 
[00:40:30]  You just totally broke every rule that is in place here.  For the people, she said, I will take a banana and put it in her C.  She used the C word.  Oh, my God.  That was really hot, though.  All right.  Laura.  Yes.  Turn that radio down first of all.  All right.  Turn the radio down.  You're like feeding back, Tosh.  I am sorry for using that word.  All right.  Okay.  Now, hey, can I make a request for the rest of our show? 
[00:41:00]  What?  If any lady feels like calling up our show and saying the C word, go for it because that  was really hot, man.  But you can't just call and say it.  It's got to be in the context of something.  Sure.  Yeah.  Maybe fit it into your story and try to sneak it past.  All right.  We would like that today.  All right.  Go ahead.  So who is this girl you would do this to?  Okay.  My friend's right here.  Either I do it to her, she does it to me.  This is the...  Do you honestly think that's going to beat kissing cousins? 
[00:41:30]  Kissing cousins?  They might not come down.  Well, the girls, they're related.  They're cousins.  Their fathers are brothers.  And the one's going to eat the peach of the other one.  Okay.  Well, all right.  Hold on.  Do you want to talk?  Hold on a second.  Here's Dana.  Okay.  New screen name.  Banana seed.  She's the one with the brain ideas.  Hold on.  Hello?  Yes.  Dana.  Yeah?  Okay.  Hello, Dana.  Hello.  Hi, Dana.  All right.  I'm willing to shove a banana up...  Oh, yeah.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You can't even say that. 
[00:42:00]  Just because you changed the C word to something else, you still can't say shove a banana up.  Okay.  All right.  Ready?  Oh.  Okay.  Put the banana in a no-no spot.  Very good.  See you.  And eat it out.  Oh, well, there you go.  Wait a minute now.  You want to take the banana and put it somewhere very, very special.  Right.  I don't blame it.  Dana.  Yeah?  And we're 18 and 19.  Oh, good God.  All right. 
[00:42:30]  Teen bananas-ies.  Oh, come on down.  Yeah.  Where are you right now?  Um, we're actually in Persephone.  Um, I just went to go pick up my boyfriend and we're going back to Central Jersey.  All right.  We could, uh, pencil you in, uh, for tomorrow just in case the kissing cousins don't come  down.  How's that?  Okay.  All right.  Hold on the line.  All right.  Hold on.  You hold on.  This is, this is legal, isn't it?  Yes, Rick.  It is.  Dana!  All right. 
[00:43:00]  Get, uh, get, uh, get, get Laura and Dana's, uh, info on line, uh, 10.  Uh, Blair, what's going on?  Opie, what's going on?  What's up?  I'm Geneseo, baby.  Oh, that's my hence the Opie.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm listening to it over the, uh, internet.  Are you really in Geneseo?  I swear to God, I'm with Chris Brzezinski.  My alma mater?  Oh, it's freaking empty up here, man.  Why?  Oh, is it like, uh...  Yeah, I'm up here.  I'm actually going to grad school at RIT.  Winter break?  Yeah.  What part of, uh, Geneseo you're, you're in right now?  I'm down on Riverside Drive, right near the old, uh, T-Count. 
[00:43:30]  Okay, sure, sure.  Sweet down here.  I got to call my old fraternity house one of these days.  When did they get back to school?  Uh, the 20th.  20th, all right.  We just saw you on GSTV.  You did?  Yeah, GSTV.  You had an interview on there.  Oh, remember that?  That's right.  I remember when, uh, when they came here to, uh, film that.  You are huge up here, too.  Huge?  Well, I don't know about there, but, you know.  I'm coming back for final bids.  Get out of here.  Are you really?  Yeah, we're going to rock.  Come up to the IB, man.  It'll be sweet.  I worked there for like five, six years. 
[00:44:00]  I didn't want to leave Geneseo.  It was too, it was like Disney World, man.  Oh, it's awesome.  And a fat car working the door at the IB?  Yeah, this is all means nothing to anyone, so.  No, sorry.  All right, Blair.  All right, thanks, Bob.  Keep in touch through, uh, Syndication Underground, all right?  Yeah, man.  All right.  Bye.  Mm.  Geneseo, we got to talk about that someday.  That was a town.  You know that I paid a guy to write my papers at that college?  Yeah, you cheated to get through college.  What, did you do that, too?  Of course.  There was a guy, there was a guy, what was the name of the place up there in Geneseo? 
[00:44:30]  He's long gone, so I can talk about it now.  Place called the Idle Hour.  The Idle Hour.  He was like, he was a townie that was just a brain.  Big, big guy.  Yeah.  That just knew everything.  I think we told this story in the air once.  And, uh.  You're cheating?  Yeah, I don't give a crap.  College was a waste of time for me.  You're going to get your, uh, diploma taken away.  Who cares?  They could have it.  Then what?  They could have it.  Spent all that money on college.  No one has ever asked me for, you know, for my diploma. 
[00:45:00]  Never, huh?  No, you could fake it.  No one ever asked me for mine, either.  The best thing I got out of college was, you know, I was able to get on a radio station.  That's about it.  But as far as schoolwork, this guy, he would just sit in the corner of this townie bar and just get hammered.  And, uh, the word that got around Geneseo that the guy would write your, uh, term papers for you.  And he was all smart and knew everything.  Like the big papers where, like, you would go to these classes and half your grade would be writing this paper.  Yeah.  So I'm like, you've got to be kidding me.  It's like, dude, 100, 200 bucks, he'll write it. 
[00:45:30]  You'll get it.  You're guaranteed a B or better.  He must have had a file cabinet at his house that just had, you know, all the term papers.  He'd pull it out, you know, make a few adjustments and give it to you.  But what if, uh, they caught on that a couple of these looked the same?  The guy was good.  They never caught on.  This guy was in business for years up there.  Wow.  But did I tell you the story?  What happened to me?  What?  I was slacking off.  I needed this guy to write a paper for me.  I went in and I made the exchange, the money.  I said, I told him the class. 
[00:46:00]  I forgot what class.  Something to do with, like, Russian history or something.  Great.  Very important for radio.  Something that I would really, really need after I left college.  Yeah.  And, uh, all of a sudden I needed the paper, let's say, on a Tuesday.  Okay?  The whole weekend I don't hear from the guy.  Monday passes, don't hear from the guy.  Oh, no.  I start freaking panicking because it's like 50, 50% of the grade.  Yeah.  And I really needed this to at least pass and get the hell out of, uh, G-Town to move on with my life.  But, turns out, the guy has a heart attack and can't write my effing paper. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, no.  What'd you do?  I found out from the other townies that the guy was in the hospital.  Make a long story short, the guy did get out in time, did get me my paper, like, at the last minute.  And I handed it in and, and like I, like I said, I got like a BB plus in the freaking thing.  But has a heart, had a heart attack.  Like, lazy, uh, professors and stuff that didn't even realize that it was the same paper year after year. 
[00:47:00]  No, this guy was smart, and he would, he would, like, change it around and this and that.  He, I mean, he had it all figured out.  He figured out what professor was doing it, so he'd switch the papers.  Ah.  You know.  He had a whole system worked out.  He was working it.  Gee, man.  So those girls are going to come down.  Dude, they're going to try and get in here today.  What, the Laura and Dana?  The, the, the, the banana girls.  Dana!  That sounds all cool and stuff, but I'm more interested in the kissing cousin thing, because  that's just sick and twisted.  Dude.  You wouldn't want to see that other thing, though?  No, I want to see the other thing. 
[00:47:30]  Come on.  But I'm holding out for the, uh, the cousin thing.  I mean.  That's just, that's just off the hook, yo.  Come on.  All right.  The banana, and then all of a sudden, she's down there, uh, with the banana?  And did we say teen?  Teen?  18 and 19, that's right.  I'm sort of thinking, and you know something?  For some reason, we didn't ask what any of these girls look like.  For some reason, we have no physical description of any of these girls.  You're going to ruin it. 
[00:48:00]  Which I don't care.  You know, that's okay, because a lot of times, you know, you hear, hey, yeah, well, yeah,  I'm cute, I'm this, I'm that, and they come in, and you're like, hey, Lady Di, how  you doing?  You know?  Something like that.  Hey, Rich, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  This is completely unfair.  Why?  Because there's no way in hell any dude is going to be able to come in there and beat  this.  Well, hey, Rich, as a listener of our show, do you care?  You're a winner by being a listener.  That's right.  Well, it's great, but I don't get to see it.  If I'm in the studio and this is happening, great. 
[00:48:30]  Hey, I won.  We take pictures.  You know what, though?  The last time we had a WWF trip to give away, it was all guys competing.  Yep.  So, it's fair.  It's a little one.  We mix it up.  Right.  When's the next time you're giving away Brewer tickets?  In a little while.  Okay, cool.  All right, man.  All right.  See, this guy knows what I'm talking about with the paper writing dude.  Anthony, you went to Geneseo.  Yeah, how you guys doing?  My first time calling.  What's going on?  Coach.  Coach was his name.  That's it.  Coach from the Idle Hour. 
[00:49:00]  That's it.  I forgot his name until you just said it.  All the boys in the fraternity used to use that guy, and I always stayed away from using  him.  Why?  Last semester, it was Humanities II.  Everyone knew, Anthony.  Yeah.  Everyone knew.  This guy had your papers.  He was famous.  Yeah.  And I took this Humanities II class.  I needed it to graduate.  And I went to the class like twice all year.  And I went to the last class before the final because we were getting our papers back.  And the professor says, I need to speak to you in my office about your paper. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, no.  So it was like 8 o'clock, 8.30 in the morning class.  And I am so hungover.  And I got the chills and all that.  And so I go to her office after class.  You have to go to the bathroom real bad.  Oh, no.  I got instant diarrhea.  It was brutal because I wasn't ready for it.  And basically, she starts quizzing me on it.  And, I mean, it was just, I just, she knew I was lost.  She wound up giving me a D on it.  I think it was a C slash D. 
[00:50:00]  And she wrote that the pen that composed the paper was brilliant.  But I'm convinced you have no idea what you're doing or something.  Since you started asking you questions about it.  And you're just like, well, the guy.  No, see, now all the memories are coming back with this guy up there in Genesee, too.  He passed away.  Yeah, I know.  Well, he had heart problems, right?  Yeah.  Well, I'm telling you, he was in the hospital when he was supposed to be writing one of my papers.  Yeah, he's gone.  He's left us.  That's too bad because a lot of fraternity boys pretty say that he is now gone. 
[00:50:30]  But I got to tell Anthony another thing.  When you went to this guy in the back of the Idle Hour up there in Genesee, in the dark corner,  he would ask you what type of student you are because he was that smart, too.  If you were like one of these tools where the teacher knew you weren't really coming,  you weren't paying attention, you know, you tell him, well, honestly, man, you know,  I'm like a C, C plus student.  He's not going to give you the A paper.  No, that's what was great about what he was doing.  But obviously, Anthony got screwed on this one.  But you're like, no, you know, I'm an A student, but I just don't have the time to go to this class 
[00:51:00]  because I'm doing it right now.  Then he would give you the A, A plus paper.  But you told him you were average or below average.  He would give you a different paper.  I'm a genius.  I remember he used to warn the guys and tell them to read the paper a couple of times.  Make sure you look up all the words.  You don't know the definition.  At least read the goddamn thing.  What?  You didn't read it or anything, right?  Well, some people didn't, Anthony.  Some people would just hand it.  Go get it from him and bring it right and hand it in.  Yeah.  You know, at least I looked up a lot of the words. 
[00:51:30]  I'm telling you.  So when you wrote about this, oh, what I meant was.  See, that's why there were guys up there that just got, they wanted the A's.  And I'm like, no, man.  You just go for the B.  Go for the F and B.  No one's going to question it.  You know, you're in it in this A-plus paper.  Of course, like, you know, a flag's going to be raised by the teacher.  What the hell's going on here?  What a dope.  That's great.  All right.  Thank you, Anthony.  All right, guys.  Someone else is saying that the coach got busted. 
[00:52:00]  John.  Yo, what's up?  You also went to Geneseo?  Yeah, I went to Geneseo.  I had a bunch of friends that were figs.  Yeah.  And they were using coach, but near the end of it.  When did he pass away?  I didn't even hear about this.  I don't even know.  I just found out, too.  I heard he was gone, but I wasn't sure.  Holy.  Because, like, they used to use the Internet near the end, and he started getting busted  because teachers were entering in phrases from the papers that I guess he was pulling  right from the Internet. 
[00:52:30]  So, I mean, it was getting harder.  So he got lazy in the end.  Near the end of his career, yeah.  Yeah.  This guy had hundreds of papers on everything.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right, John.  Thank you.  That's a memory from the past.  Those two girls calling back, huh?  Oh, they want to tell us what they look like.  Dana!  Dana?  Yeah?  Laura?  Turn that radio down.  Yeah?  So what do you guys look like?  All right.  This is Dana.  I'm 5'11".  I have blonde hair and blue eyes. 
[00:53:00]  Mm-hmm.  Laura is also 5'11".  She has brown hair and brown eyes.  All right.  And we're not fat.  So you're all right.  Laura has big boobs, and I have small boobs.  Well, there you go.  We like both of you.  But I have a really nice ass.  That's...  All right.  Great.  Dana!  All right.  All right.  We're looking forward to you coming down here.  Oh, and I?  Yeah.  This is her boyfriend.  All right.  Boyfriend's ruining it.  Listen, listen.  What we're going to do is we're going to make a Voyeur banana milkshake for you guys. 
[00:53:30]  Nice.  All right.  All right.  Come on down.  We're going to send these girls down.  Can we bring her out on the bus or what?  Bring her on what bus?  There is no bus.  It's a Voyeur bus.  I'm free.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Just get the girls here.  God.  Guys, reen it.  Every time.  You know what?  We say things like, no, leave the guy.  Leave the guy at home or something.  Because, believe me, the girls are just as dopey.  But they're nice to have down here because they're chicks. 
[00:54:00]  You know?  That's all.  It's not like, oh, why?  The girls can come down, but the guys can't.  Equally as dopey.  But the guys are just like total waste to us.  Man, they just get in the way.  Get the bus.  What?  What?  What?  All right.  We got to take a break.  This is wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  Right.  I love that new clip.  We got to take a break.  Jessica, the teen nymph on the line.  We'll talk to her.  All right.  And we should talk to that radio station in Mississippi.  See if we can't get their call letter. 
[00:54:30]  W-O-N-A.  We're doing nine hours of radio already for W-N-E-W.  Now we want to change the call letters.  Let's branch out.  But Rick's got some funny stories about this radio station in the middle of Mississippi.  They're in the middle of nowhere, man.  The morning guy is out hunting deer in between, like, plowing his fields.  And we'll talk to Rick next about that.  And if you got anything, 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7. 
[00:55:00]  Opie and Anthony.  This is debauchery mania.  Prostate exams for everyone.  1-1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Another screen name that is up for grabs on opanthony.com.  Which one now?  Tunnel Wart.  Tunnel Wart.  That's pretty nasty.  Well, Anthony, we're going to do another nine hours of radio for W-N-E-W today. 
[00:55:30]  Yep.  As the place is in absolute turmoil.  In disarray, as they say.  So we have taken it upon ourselves to try to save this place once again.  I don't know why.  We should just do our show.  Let them try to figure out what to do.  When other shows just, you know, up and leave.  Why not?  We can't just throw us on any slot that's open. 
[00:56:00]  You can't take your ball and go,  Well, we're trying to change the call letters of this place they call W-N-E-W.  Yeah.  We would really like to have the call letters W-O-N-A.  W-O-N-A.  Started as a little gag, obviously.  We did some research, or our listeners did the research for us.  And we discovered there's a radio station in the middle of Mississippi, in all Mississippi, that calls themselves W-O-N-A. 
[00:56:30]  Matter of fact, they call themselves 95 Hog?  Hog 95.  Hog 95.  Meow, meow, meow, meow.  Meow, meow, meow.  Hog 95 W-O-N-A.  Yeah, they're, uh...  So, we've been trying to get them on the radio for the last two days, but Rick has been having a hell of a time because...  Excuse me.  I guess these guys in between doing radio shows are like farmers and stuff.  I believe their slug line for the station is, we put the cunch in country. 
[00:57:00]  You know what I mean.  Dude, it's been an education talking to these people, man.  Huh.  So, like, it's a station, but they...  Yeah.  They're in Winona, Mississippi.  Oh, W-O-N-A.  Winona.  Right.  Winona, Mississippi.  Right.  Yee-hoo!  We're talking small town.  I talked to Susie, who runs the station.  Okay.  That's when she's not on the air. 
[00:57:30]  Ah, what is she...  What shift does she have?  I have no idea she didn't divulge that to me.  I don't know.  Does she have an accent?  She's not too bad.  Oh.  I was speaking to her father earlier.  What does he do?  Johnny.  Now, Johnny was answering the phones for the station.  Imagine somebody's father answering the phones here.  Foundry.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.  You know something?  I think these two are perfect to run WNEW.  Yeah.  We ought to offer them a job.  Right.  Now, Johnny ran out. 
[00:58:00]  I don't know where.  Okay.  And the guy we really...  Susie wanted us to talk to, Tim, who's their morning man.  Ah, the morning man.  The morning guy.  The morning man.  Okay, yeah.  Um, he couldn't be on the radio today because he is up in a deer stand.  A tree stand?  A tree stand.  For these deer hunting.  He's hunting buck.  God damn, what a life.  That sounds fun.  So, he's blowing off his opportunity to be heard in New York City because he's got to  be in a tree all day waiting for a deer to come by. 
[00:58:30]  He's got to go shoot.  Don't need no goddamn New York City.  Who needs it?  All right.  So, uh, yeah.  So, uh, Susie has agreed to come on the air.  Okay.  And, uh, Johnny, her dad, uh, also promised that he would send us some t-shirts.  Nice.  To give out to our listeners as well.  W-O-N-A t-shirts.  W-O-N-A t-shirts.  Hog 95.  Hog 95.  Now, obviously not being syndicated.  I don't know, uh, how many people even know who the hell we are. 
[00:59:00]  Right.  So, this might be advantageous this time because I think if she knew who we were, she would  never agree to talk to us.  Well, let's, uh, talk to Susie from, uh, Hog 95.  All right.  W-O-N-A in Mississippi.  Susie.  Yes.  How are you?  I'm just fine.  How are you?  All right.  Very good.  What kind of bum?  We wanted to talk to your morning guy there.  Oh, yeah.  Well, it's afternoon.  He's not here.  You're stuck with me.  But, uh, didn't he realize this was a, uh, a big opportunity to be heard in New York 
[00:59:30]  City?  Well, maybe, but, you know, deer hunting has its priorities here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess.  What, what shift, uh, do you do?  I am on with him from eight until nine every morning.  Oh, you're like the, uh, the...  Morning team.  Morning team.  Yeah.  Do you have a, a name of, uh, of the show?  Sure.  The Make and Bacon Show.  The what?  The Make and Bacon Show?  Of course.  Oh, well, that rocks.  And, and, uh...  And who's, uh, who? 
[01:00:00]  I'm sorry?  Who's who?  Uh, it's Tim and him and her, and I'm her.  Tim and him and her.  Yeah.  Tim, him and her.  So you come on, uh, for an hour?  Yeah, I'm on from eight to nine with him.  And what?  With Tim.  You just do the, what do you do, the news or something?  No, I'm just there for him to bounce ideas off of and, you know, give a hard time generally.  How come only an hour?  Well, I, I have other, um...  Things she has to do at the station.  I just have a lot to do, yeah.  W-O-N-A.  Don't you own the station, too? 
[01:00:30]  Yes.  Wow, you own the station, and you're part of the Make and Bacon Morning Show.  Yes, I also clean the bathroom.  Tim and her.  Tim, him and her.  And you clean the bathroom.  Sure.  Wow.  And Johnny's your dad?  Yep.  And what does Johnny do for the radio station?  Uh, well, he does some of the local news and play-by-play.  Oh, God, I would love to hear some tapes.  Wouldn't you love to hear this, uh, station?  It sounds like a very quaint, nice, little, small-town station.  Are you guys on the internet?  Yes, we are.  Oh, you mean, as far as, on, no, no, we're not. 
[01:01:00]  No, no, we can't, we can't hear you on the internet?  No, no, you can't, can't hear us.  Now, what kind of, uh, what kind of stunts or, or bits, bits, you know bits, right?  Right.  What kind of bits do you guys do, uh, during the, the morning show?  Uh, just trying to get a feel of, uh, what you're all about down there in Mississippi.  Well, it's a, it's a country format.  Right.  Of course.  Hog 95, right?  No, well, you, well, you have to say it right now.  Uh-uh.  Oh, God.  You ready?  Yeah.  Hog 95.  Hog 95.  There you go.  On Hog 95. 
[01:01:30]  No, you're making bacon on Hog 95.  You're making bacon.  Making bacon.  That's great.  I like that.  Yeah.  Making bacon on Hog 95.  Yeah, what, what, what, what's a couple of songs on, uh, your playlist there?  Um.  New country or old country?  We play it all.  Yeah.  Um, it's been, during our morning show, um, we'll go all the way, way back to G's, 50's.  To G's?  Well, no, we go further than G. A lot of times we go to, you know, K.  Ah, there you go.  You know, a lot of times, we'll, we'll go all the way to K. 
[01:02:00]  All the way back.  You know, you know, we're looking for, uh, a couple new radio shows here in New York City.  Yeah.  Uh, WNEW here in New York is in turmoil.  Oh, really?  We have been through more shows here in the past, uh, year or two than, than you could count.  And right now, I think we have an opening, uh, middays.  Oh, do you?  Uh, 7 to, uh, 11.  Yeah.  And, uh, maybe, uh, mornings if you can say, sports guys.  If you can say what?  Uh, all you have to do is be able to say, sports guys. 
[01:02:30]  Sports guys?  Yeah.  Yeah, you said it pretty good.  Just like we know how to say, hog 95.  There you go.  Yeah.  Making bacon.  Making bacon on the hog.  Making bacon on the hog.  On the hog.  Oh, now I get it.  You got it now?  Now it makes sense.  Making bacon on the hog.  There you go.  You do have it.  Can you guys send us a tape of the morning show?  We would love to play for our audience in New York City.  Hey, you're going to make fun of us.  Well, believe me, people make fun of us.  Yeah, we'll critique it and stuff.  Well, maybe we'll put you on the line and, uh, you know, you can defend yourself and stuff. 
[01:03:00]  Okay.  I think you're, I think, I think it could, it could be a lot of fun.  Oh, I agree.  So what kind of games are you doing during the morning show?  Yeah, you involve the listeners and stuff.  Yeah, well, you know, it's a small market radio station, so that's really our only vice is to be really local.  Yeah.  So, um, I don't know, this time of year, just getting over Christmas, it's kind of very calm.  Yeah.  How big a town are you in there?  Uh, the town of Winona, the actual population of the town is, uh, about 13,000. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah, but, but, there's more.  Oh.  We are the only radio station in two counties.  In two counties.  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  Do you, uh, do that on some promos and stuff?  The only station in two counties.  Yes, sir.  Are you at the radio station right now?  Yes, I am.  Can you play, like, some sweepers for us down the phone line or something?  Oh, that'd be, that'd rock.  Oh, well, you'll have to let me put you on, I'm in my office right now. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  I don't know if I can get them on the line, because we've just had everything kind of re-hooked up,  and I don't know how to work it, but I can play it loud enough for you guys to hear it, probably.  Yeah, that'd be great.  Sarah, Sarah, could you try and...  ...you guys down there in Mississippi could, uh, relate to it.  Hey, you're good to read it.  And what is that?  Well, maybe we should tell you at the end of this car, say this.  Uh-oh.  Because we like Susie.  Oh, you like me, thank you.  Yeah, we do.  Well, I like you, too.  You like a nice gal.  The reason we're calling you, we want to change the call letters at WNEW to W-O-N-A. 
[01:04:30]  You know, I don't think you can do that.  I know.  What if we buy the call letters from you or something?  Uh, how much time do I have to come up with a good price?  Well, WNEW, those are legendary call letters, and they belong in Mississippi.  Yeah, maybe we can trade it.  An Even-Steven kind of thing?  W-N-E-W.  Hmm.  And then we take, because being the Opie and Anthony show...  Right.  A lot of people just say, uh, O-N-A.  Yeah.  You know, O-N-A.  But it comes out O-N-A.  See, we do nine hours of radio for this, uh, this place up here in New York City. 
[01:05:00]  We are completely carrying this radio station.  Oh, is that right?  Swear to God, nine hours of programming in New York...  Hmm, I'm impressed.  ...consists of the Opie and Anthony show.  And I'm sure you've never heard of us, because we're not syndicated or anything?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you will be.  Uh, but maybe to give you an idea, do you remember, um, over the summer when that girl  flashed her boobs on the Today Show, and that was a huge national story?  Yes.  That was us?  Yeah, that was us.  No way.  Look at that, Susie, huh?  Yeah.  We, we, we started the whole wow thing, whip them out Wednesday. 
[01:05:30]  You ever hear of that?  Jay Leno was talking about us, and Matt Lauer on the Jay Leno show.  Well, I, I know exactly what you're referring to, but I, I'm not familiar with the wow thing.  Ah.  Ah, yeah.  Well.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Maybe she would know about the mayor of Boston thing.  Hmm.  Maybe not.  That kind of made the radio circles.  Yeah.  We got fired from our last job in Boston, uh, because we told everyone the mayor of the  city died in a car accident.  Ah.  Yeah, that was cool.  Oh, you're bad.  Well, we learned from then, Susie.  Hey, can you, can you, we're, we're live though, right? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Oh, I better not say it.  Well, we're, we're on like a two hour delay.  You could say anything, believe me.  Can you say the F word in New York City?  No.  No.  That's still a rule that just goes coast to coast.  Oh, yeah.  Doesn't matter where you are, you can't ever use the F word.  Yeah.  What's the wildest thing, uh, you guys have done on your radio station?  Yeah.  Give us some of the, uh, maybe press worthy things you guys have done.  Hmm.  We're trying to get to know our, our, our new friends in Mississippi.  Yeah.  We can be like pen pals, you know?  You know how they do that?  Yeah, that's true.  Well, let's see. 
[01:06:30]  Um, you're probably not going to believe me when I tell you this.  Oh, try us.  Are you sure?  Mm-hmm.  Well, we have to run obituaries every day.  Oh, my God.  Now that's, you don't mind if we steal that, because that sounds like a great idea.  You run obituaries.  We have to.  How many people die in a 13,000 population town that you have to run it every day?  Maybe you get a day where no one died.  Well, the thing is, we only have a weekly newspaper. 
[01:07:00]  So, if you die after press time on Wednesday, you are SOL until the next week.  And do you guys do it with a straight face?  Yeah.  Do you have, like, music in the background?  No, there's no music, and it's very straight.  You're not playing, there's a tear in my beer?  No.  No, we never do.  There's a tear in my beer.  Is there any commentary, maybe, about what he did?  No.  No?  No.  No, it's very straight, straight to the point. 
[01:07:30]  You know, what else can you say?  Yeah.  Wow, and how long could that possibly last?  Well, it depends on how many you have.  I guess a tornado or a flood would...  That would be pretty, pretty bad.  Are you guys part of that tornado alley thing?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, and as a matter of fact, not to toot our own horn, but that is one of our largest priorities, actually.  Oh, really?  All kidding aside, yeah.  Emergency Broadcasting Network, and then you ring the bell, and people go to the root cellar. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, not the root cellar, but the root cellar.  The root cellar is used for something entirely different.  Yes, yes, and we can't talk about that.  I don't understand, you know, you people that live in the tornado alley there.  Well, they say the same thing about New York.  But over and over, you know, your homes are destroyed, and then people get on the local TV.  You got local TV down there, right?  No.  You don't have, like, a local news station or anything?  No, we don't.  Not locally.  No, that's why we are very fortunate in our area, because we don't have a local station, 
[01:08:30]  and our newspaper is only weekly.  We are it, as far as your news is concerned.  Can I ask you something?  Sure.  What were the morning show's ratings, the last book that came out?  Well, in our area, I'm not sure, because we don't subscribe.  It really does not help us in our area.  Now, it does on a lot of national accounts. 
[01:09:00]  But in our neighboring city, which is, I'm not sure the population of our neighboring city,  we were number two.  And what kind of a ratings share would you have had?  I really couldn't answer that.  A ballpark figure.  Was it like a 10 share?  Maybe even a 15 or 20 share?  It would be more than that.  More than that.  So, you're talking maybe a 30 share or a 40 share? 
[01:09:30]  At least, yes.  See, look at this.  A 40 share?  Well, we're the only country station.  Right.  I understand.  And no competition.  No competition.  Thank you.  A 30 share.  You just helped us with a point we made yesterday.  And what was that?  It's too long to get into today.  That's why we're calling Mississippi, because we get along with no one,  even within five states of New York.  Oh, yeah.  So, it's just atrocious.  Hey, what do you guys do when you go on vacation?  Do you play best of the obituaries?  No, actually. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  Well, we took an entire week off between Christmas and New Year's.  Oh, damn.  Look at you.  Yeah.  Computers are a wonderful gadget.  Oh, it just kind of runs the music.  Yeah.  You guys play country and western?  Yes, we do.  All right.  Should we get her to play some of the sweepers for us, Anthony?  I would love to hear a couple.  Okay.  Are you going to take a break and let me change rooms?  Yeah, we'll put you on hold, and you go do what you have to do, and we'll make sure  somebody keeps tabs.  Hey, Susie, could you take us to break? 
[01:10:30]  Make believe you're broadcasting on Hog 95 W-O-N-A.  You mean as far as me doing a live intro?  Yeah, like an outro.  We're going into a break right now, so do a break like you would at your station, and  we'll go right into commercials.  Right.  Okay.  You want me to do this now?  Sure.  Yeah.  I knew you were going to do this to me.  It's all right.  Um, let's see.  This ain't canned ham.  It's old hog.  Your hog, 95 FM.  We'll be right back with more country in just a minute. 
[01:11:00]  Rock.  Making bacon.  Making bacon.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  Right.  All right, Susie, hold on.  Okay.  All right, set her up, man.  Get her in her sweepers.  Make sure we keep her on the line in Mississippi.  She will go and get the sweepers.  Rick is picking her up right now.  Ben put up a map of, uh, there.  All right, she's picked up.  Of this town in Mississippi, and there's nowhere.  They're in the middle of nowhere. 
[01:11:30]  Hysterical.  She's, they're in the middle of nowhere.  They have a 40 share.  The point I was trying to make with the tornado alleys and stuff, because, you know, these people,  they lose their homes over and over again, right?  And then they get on the tube, and they say, you know, we're going to rebuild our lives  and stuff, and they say this, and then the next summer comes or whatever, and the next  tornado takes them out.  Yeah.  I'm like, why wouldn't you just move your house?  Your house has wheels.  Just hook it up to the truck.  Your house has wheels. 
[01:12:00]  It's easy to move it to somewhere else.  You could even just maybe move it out of the way of the tornado.  Right.  You kind of watch and go, hey, look, it's coming this way.  I'll just go over there, watch it pass, and then you put your house back where it was.  There you go.  That sounds easy enough.  Boy, you know, even though this is W-O-N-A and we're calling them because we want their  call letters, I think a new feature might be to call these small town radio stations  and see if we can find some talent for this station.  Not a bad idea.  How are we going to find some call letters?  I don't know.  And find a town smaller than this one. 
[01:12:30]  This one is small, 13,000 people.  The obituaries.  Ray on line eight, three and a half minutes until Opie and Anthony piss her off.  Yeah, everybody's chomping, waiting.  We're just going to tell her what we're doing later on our show, the kissing cousins, eating  the peach thing.  It's like a tribute to Mississippi.  You know what's funny?  If we were in Mississippi, she would be our boss.  I know.  How would she handle us if we were on the air and we had an eat the peach segment?  Oh, my God.  I don't think it would ever get that far.  What you boys doing?  We would have to, we'll have to ask her next, okay? 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  All right, Anthony.  We'll be back with Susie from Mississippi next.  The Dopey and Anthony Show.  I think that might be part of the problem with society today.  Oh, I believe we're the problem.  Dopey, you stupid bitch.  1027 WNEW.  We're having a monster truck show in two weeks.  Gee, you're busting apart those stereotypes, aren't you?  Oh, yeah.  A monster truck thing in a couple of weeks.  Nice.  Uh-huh.  We're talking about that live. 
[01:13:30]  Bigfoot Grave Digger.  Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.  You know, one of those.  Uh-huh.  In the balls.  So what other live reads do you do?  Any local companies?  Oh, sure, sure.  Let's see.  Well, we have a special treasure.  What's that?  That is a gift shop.  Oh, special treasure.  Yes.  And they sell special treasures.  Exactly. 
[01:14:00]  Is it a sex shop?  No, we don't have any of those.  Oh, my God, Opie.  We don't have them in New York anymore either.  No, really?  Mayor Giuliani took care of that up here.  Oh, I'm sure he did.  Yeah.  All right, so would you like to listen to us do a live read?  Yeah, sure.  All right, these people pay a lot of money for this.  Ready?  Hey, wait a minute.  Yeah.  You going to tell me how much you get for a 30-second ad?  How much do we get for 30 seconds?  I can tell you how much they spend on what we're about to do.  Okay.  About three grand.  No way. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  I don't believe you.  You're lying.  Here is the $3,000 read for Iceland Air.  You ever think about going to Iceland, Susie?  Not lately.  It sounds like a lot of people have misconceptions about Iceland.  You think it's a big chunk of ice, right?  Right.  It's not.  No?  Yeah, that's right.  It's nice and warm.  No, it's really not warm.  Okay.  But it's a great place to go.  Let me hear the ad.  Okay, you want to get away for a couple of days?  How about Iceland?  It's not what you think.  It's winter here.  It's winter there, too. 
[01:15:00]  And probably warmer.  You know it's warmer in Iceland than it is here in New York in the winter.  Try snowmobiling, horseback riding, soaking in a natural hot tub in the middle of a lava field.  Now, that sounds like fun, right, Susie?  Sure.  And get this.  With more bars and clubs per person than anywhere in the world, there's no excuse for not having fun.  Could you believe that?  More bars per person than anywhere in the world.  I would think maybe Thailand would have that distinct honor.  Hey, Susie, do you even have an airport nearby? 
[01:15:30]  Actually, we do.  I can see it from here.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Yeah.  Winona International Airport.  Oh, my God.  Winona International?  Well, we like to call it that.  Oh, what is it?  A grass field?  No, we do have an asphalt runway, but it's for crop dusters.  Oh, hog.  Yikes.  Sorry.  Nice.  All right, we're going to listen to those next.  Yeah.  I'm looking at a map of your area here.  You live near F Hill?  I'm sorry?  There's a town called F Hill?  I can't say the word.  No, there's not a... 
[01:16:00]  No, what's the town north of Winona?  It looks like on this map that was given to me, it says F Hill.  The F word?  The F word, Hill.  And then...  No, no, no, no.  I'm dead serious, though.  Duck, as in Donald.  Oh, Duck Hill.  Yeah.  That's different.  It looked like F Hill, Susie.  No, no.  Duck Hill.  I wasn't even trying to make a joke there.  And then there's Coffeeville a little north of you.  Yes.  So it's like, well, we've got to take a drive up Duck Hill.  Hey, you're good.  I like that accent. 
[01:16:30]  All right.  Thank you.  Anthony, let's finish up with Iceland Air.  Iceland Air.  Yeah.  It sounds like a really great place to visit.  Iceland.  Great vacation.  Midweek packages from Iceland Air Holiday starts at $299 per person, including air and two-night hotel.  You can't stay in the city for that.  That's true.  New York City costs you hundreds.  Where's the hotel go for down there, Susie?  $70 a night.  $70 a night.  Manhattan, you're looking at $300.  You could go to Iceland for $299 a person. 
[01:17:00]  Is it a nice hotel for $70?  No.  Motel 6 type places?  Yep.  I'll leave the lad on for you.  Visit IcelandAir.com and visit Iceland.  It's not just a big block of ice.  Fares do not include taxes.  Seats limited and restrictions apply.  And in parentheses, it says required to say this by law.  So there you go, Susie.  Iceland Air.  You told me I want to go.  They spent a lot of money on that library there.  Doesn't it sound like a great place?  Yes, it does.  All right.  We'll be back with Susie from Mississippi in just a bit, all right? 
[01:17:30]  Right.  Stay there, Susie.  I'm not going anywhere.  All right.  It's W-N-E-W.  This is a God-given talent to be this stupid and this funny and this filthy.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  All right, Anthony.  On the phone, we have Susie from W-O-N-A.  Yes.  In Mississippi.  Mississippi.  Had a lot of fun with her today.  Hey.  She's our new friend.  We were trying to buy her call letters so we could change the name of W-N-E-W to W-O-N-A. 
[01:18:00]  But it looks like it's not going to work, right, Susie?  I don't know.  No.  You guys got the call letter recognition.  Yeah.  With that.  Well, we've had it so long.  How long have you been there?  Uh, 1958.  58?  58.  What, did your dad own it?  No.  He got it in...  A poker game?  Actually, yes.  Probably.  He bought it in... 
[01:18:30]  He went in partners with someone in 1980, I believe.  Mm-hmm.  And, as they say, got it outright in 89.  Right.  Something like that.  Hey, um, Susie.  Mm-hmm.  How easy is it to get from New York City to Wynonna, Mississippi?  That's Wynonna.  Wynonna.  Yes, Wynonna.  Wynonna.  Sorry.  Actually, it's not Wynonna.  It's Wynonna.  Wynonna.  There you go.  Everyone says Wynonna.  Wynonna.  Okay.  Well, let's see.  I know it's Hogg 95. 
[01:19:00]  There you go.  You have it right.  I don't know what interstate it is.  Is it 80?  Well, this is what we want to do.  Yeah.  And we're dead serious.  We've got a guy that works on our show.  His name's Stinky.  Stinky?  Yes.  We're in Hogg country.  There we go again.  You're in Hogg.  Yeah, let's hear that again.  You want to hear that again?  Yeah, get the phone closer, though.  Okay, well, hang on.  All right.  You're waiting.  Cheers of research, testing, and careful planning. 
[01:19:30]  Throws right out the window.  It's Make It Bacon.  Weekday mornings on W-O-N-A.  95.1.  So long.  Oh, man.  Did you get that?  Wow.  Wow.  God, that's our...  Oh, man, we want W-O-N-A.  Make It Bacon.  Make It Bacon.  The one and only.  On the Hog.  That's nice.  Thank you.  Yeah, we have this guy, Stinky.  And we're thinking of maybe having a pilgrimage to your fine little town in Mississippi. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, are you?  Would you treat Stinky nice if we sent him down there?  Sure.  How funny would that be?  Seriously, Anthony.  Quite neighborly.  One day, right?  Right.  Stinky's on the air?  Sure.  He is picked up right outside the station.  And he's got to do it with, like, trucks and stuff.  Sure.  What, like hitching?  Yeah, no planes.  No planes.  He just has to get there from here.  Yeah.  To hitch from New York City to Winona, Mississippi.  And the whole time, you know, he has a cell phone and we track his progress.  I think that would be phenomenal. 
[01:20:30]  That would be hilarious.  And we would treat him so well.  Yeah?  Sure.  What would you do to entertain our stadium?  Yeah, what's there to do down there?  Maybe on a weekend or something.  On a weekend.  Let's see.  You can watch the grass grow.  Really?  We do a lot of that here.  Any good bars or...  Like, where's the nearest movie theater?  30 miles.  30 miles to a movie theater?  Yes. 
[01:21:00]  And I was not raised here.  I'm not from here originally.  Oh, really?  You know, you've heard of Elvis, right?  I think so, yeah.  Yeah.  Okay, well, he was from a small town in Mississippi called Tupelo.  Sure.  Well, that's where I'm originally from.  Oh, there you go.  You're a Tupelo honey.  Yes, sir.  Right on.  So, this has been...  I've been here, though, quite some time.  So, it's...  But it's still...  You know, I must say, this is a coincidence.  There's a guy on the line.  His name's Duke.  Yeah?  He lived 30 minutes from...  Wyona. 
[01:21:30]  No way.  Or Wona.  Or Weona.  Winona.  Winona.  You're kidding.  Hold on.  Let's say hi to Duke.  Hey, Duke, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  All right.  Hey, my name's Duke.  I moved up here from Oxford, Mississippi about seven months ago.  Oxford?  Yeah, Oxford.  It's about halfway between Winona and Tupelo.  Okay.  You guys were talking about the trailers a little earlier and why people don't move out of the trailers.  Yeah.  Or they don't move their trailers.  Yeah.  The wheels cost extra. 
[01:22:00]  See, you got to pay about an extra thousand dollars when they tow it out there.  They just drop it, take the wheels off, and take them with them.  Because we were thinking you could just hitch the trailer up and then drive it away from the tornado, and then you just come back.  Right.  Well, you know, you could do that.  All right, Duke.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  So there's nothing to do down there?  Well, not really.  It's really hunting and fishing.  Would you welcome Stinky to your town? 
[01:22:30]  Yes.  With open arms.  Would you have, like, a welcome sign and everything?  Of course.  Where do people stay?  Is there a bed and breakfast or something, somewhere where he could stay?  Sure.  I mean, we have a motel here.  More importantly, no, we'd want him to stay with, like, someone's family.  Yeah.  He would be, like, your exchange student for, like, a weekend.  Yeah.  I could arrange something.  I got to ask one more question.  Sure.  Stinky likes to smoke the wacky tobacco.  Ah, you know the wacky tobacco, right? 
[01:23:00]  I've heard of it, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, Stinky loves his wacky tobacco.  You know, there is a law against that in Mississippi.  Is there not there?  A law?  Yeah.  Against smoking pot?  Yeah, really.  I'm not kidding.  There's a law here, too, and stuff, but if you're just caught with as much as Stinky  ever has it, they pretty much just write you a ticket.  Oh, do they?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do they do down there?  I don't even want to know.  Um, um, um, I don't know.  Y'all in a heap of trouble, boy.  Sure enough.  Yeah, huh? 
[01:23:30]  We're also thinking about sending Black Earl down.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Do you like the black folk down there?  Yeah.  Of course we do.  Yeah?  We have a tremendous, tremendous black audience, believe it or not, even though we're country.  Yes, sir.  Yeah, we do, too.  What, they have radios when they're, um, out in the fields?  Oh, that's bad.  Oh, baby.  That is, that's the inappropriate bell.  See, now you blew it.  I cannot play a copy of this here now.  See?  I'll have to edit that out.  Yeah, you can edit that part out.  What, you're going to play this back on your morning show? 
[01:24:00]  I'm going to take some excerpts, sure.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right, let's get Stinky in here.  I think Stinky needs to make a pilgrimage.  A pilgrimage.  All right, well, let me ask a question.  To Winona.  Yeah.  Where does he arrive at the name Stinky?  Is that something safe?  Should I even ask?  Hey, Susie, let me tell you about Stinky.  Go ahead.  He started as an intern, and he's climbing up the Opie and Anthony ladder quite quickly.  He's now in a union and gets a real paycheck and stuff.  Oh, yeah?  But the problem was, uh, the first day on the job, when he came in as an intern, he stunk. 
[01:24:30]  I think he was nervous.  Really bad, because he was nervous.  Oh, I see.  He hasn't stunk since, but he's kind of stuck with the nickname Stinky.  Once you get that nickname Stinky, it's so hard to shake.  Yeah, I can imagine.  You smell like roses the rest of your life.  But you'll still be Stinky.  Do you have a nickname, Susie?  Do I have a nickname?  Yeah.  No.  No?  They don't call you something?  They don't really call me anything.  No?  Well, see, I'm on with it with Tim in the mornings from 8 to 9.  Of course, Tim and him and her.  And her, yes.  Making bacon. 
[01:25:00]  Making bacon on the hog.  There you go.  That's right.  Hog 95.  But then I also do, like, the news and obituaries and stuff in the afternoon, and I kind of use  a little bit different voice.  What's the top story today?  I don't know.  I didn't listen to the news.  All right, listen, listen.  We got Earl in the studio.  Susie?  Yeah?  Don't get mad.  Don't get mad.  Because I don't want you editing this out of your little tape that you're going to play  on the morning show.  But we call Earl Black Earl. 
[01:25:30]  Well, but there's a reason.  Yeah?  The guy wears black every day.  Oh, I see.  Black from head to toe.  Has nothing to do with his ethnic background.  He's also a colored gentleman.  You can't say that in the South, either.  That isn't.  But that has nothing to do with it.  It's just the fact that he has black clothing.  He even has black underwear and black socks on every single day.  You don't say.  Sometimes Opie can set race relations back, like, decades.  I can see that.  I mean, just colored is not a term that is used in this day and age. 
[01:26:00]  Absolutely not.  No.  So, Susie, what if we sent Earl and Stinky to Mississippi?  Well, just bring them on.  Really?  Yeah.  Sure.  There you go.  Stinky, would you be up for this?  I'd go.  We are dead serious.  We're going to just, like, throw you out on the street.  And I got to drive there?  You know what?  Susie, hold on.  I got to put you on with somebody.  There happens to be.  Wait, it could be good here.  There happens to be a guy, Tim, who's going cross-country. 
[01:26:30]  Right, Tim?  Yep.  Well, where are you going?  I'm going to San Diego.  San Diego.  Would you like to make a stop off in Mississippi to drop Stinky off?  Sure.  I got to go with a nice set of double Ds.  You could do a wowing in Mississippi.  So you're going cross-country with your girlfriend?  I'm a girlfriend.  Good friend of mine.  Good friend of yours?  Yeah.  Would you like to pick up Stinky and maybe drop him off?  Sure.  At Hog 95?  Yeah.  Yeah, we got some bacon over here, too. 
[01:27:00]  When do you guys leave in cross-country?  Sunday night or Monday morning.  It has to be on Monday, man.  And by the time our radio show's on, we'll have you guys on the whole time to see, you  know, your progress on the road.  Yeah, I got a cell phone, too.  I'll call you.  I'm dead serious.  Play by play.  Stinky, would you do this?  Yeah, I'll do this.  We have to find someone to go with you.  I was thinking Psycho Mark, but no, don't even make that suggestion.  Susie, you don't even want to know about Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark might not fit in.  I'm pretty psycho myself.  Don't worry about it.  He'd end up on a chain gang or something. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, Susie, he's from Boston.  Did Susie hang up?  No, I'm still here.  Somebody was speaking to me.  Oh, you're in shock at this point.  You know, yes.  Well, we're having a flag discussion.  A flag discussion?  Yes.  What do you mean?  Well, Mississippi is voting on a new state flag.  Oh, really?  Uh-oh.  What's the problem with the old one?  Well, it's a racial problem.  There seems to be an old Union Jack on that thing.  Yeah.  The Confederate flag.  So what is W-O-N-A's stance on the new Mississippi flag? 
[01:28:00]  Uh, W-O-N-A does not take a personal view.  Uh-huh.  Susie does, though.  What's your view on the whole thing?  Well, I'm a rebel.  I'm sorry.  You want to keep the flag, right?  Amen.  Yes.  Yay!  God damn, you're absolutely right.  Absolutely.  That's what I say.  It's a bit of history.  You know what I mean?  It is.  So why, uh, why, uh, cover it up?  You know, you guys were fighting for what you believed in back then.  Right.  And, uh, why, what the hell am I saying? 
[01:28:30]  Look at our, our own, uh, black girl is agreeing with you wholeheartedly.  Is he?  Yeah, we call him the Oreo cookie.  Oh, dang.  Oh, you guys are bad.  He's, uh, uh, no, we love the guy.  All right, uh, Susie, can we hear another sweeper from the, uh, the morning show?  The, uh, the, uh.  How hard is it going to be?  Yeah, let's hear.  What?  Who's trying to talk to us?  I, I hear another voice in the background.  I don't know where it came from.  Not here.  Oh, that might be Tim.  Yeah.  No, no, it's not me.  All right, hang up.  Hold on, hold on, Tim.  Hold on, Tim.  And, um, all right, Susie? 
[01:29:00]  Susie.  Yeah.  Can we hear a couple more of your, uh, your sweepers and whatnot?  Sure.  You ready?  Yeah.  Okay.  I don't know what's coming up next, but you just got them named odd names, so I don't  know.  We're the nobody the other stations keep talking about.  So, remember, nobody plays more music, nobody has more winners, and nobody has more fun.  The Hard 95.1, W-O-N-A. 
[01:29:30]  That's so cool to hear, W-O-N-A.  It really is cool.  Now, Susie, is there maybe a little radio war going on?  A lot of the stations call you the nobody station?  Well, we're just such a, we're as small market as they come.  Yeah, so some of the big city stations, uh, yeah, there's a little bit of rivalry, just  a little bit.  Mm.  Yeah.  All right.  Not as bad anymore, but we were, we have, um, we changed our frequency about a year and  a half ago and went up with our tower.  And no one noticed?  Uh, no, yeah, they did notice.  That's what all the controversy was about.  We're the nobody that everyone's talking about. 
[01:30:00]  You got it.  That's cool.  You have to send us a package, because we want to hear this stuff.  It'll be much better when it's not on the phone, you know?  Yeah, and some T-shirts and stuff.  All right, uh, Susie, I have to ask this, because our listeners are asking, um, what  do you look like?  What do I look like?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  You want the truth, or you want me to make it sound really good?  Uh.  No, just tell us.  Okay, let's see.  Five, four.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, probably one, twenty-three. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  Blonde hair.  Mm-hmm.  Blue eyes.  Yeah.  That's it.  All right.  Big boobies.  I knew it!  Oh, baby!  Stop, you know something?  No, I want to apologize, Susie.  No, I knew.  Because Opie always goes in this direction.  No, I'm just, I'm just asking.  Not that I, I'm not, you know, always goes in this direction.  You got the itty-bitty ones.  No.  And it, oh, Opie.  I'm just asking.  Opie.  This is no way, it's a start of friendship.  Hey, Susie.  Yeah?  How long would we last on your radio station if you were the boss? 
[01:31:00]  Hmm.  I'd have to put some thought into that one.  Yeah.  I am the boss.  I know.  I know.  Sitting in a meeting with Susie about some of our content would be a little fun.  We should tell Susie.  You could not get away with it, believe me.  Yeah.  Susie, what's the, what's the biggest band that you guys promoted on your radio show?  The biggest band?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  A lot of them.  Um, let's see.  Well, just recently, um, of course, this is, you know, you guys aren't into country, so.  Uh, we're into, oh, country. 
[01:31:30]  No, no.  Well, let's see.  Charlie Daniels was just here.  Oh, there you go.  Well, there you go.  I like the Charlie.  Kenny Chesney, Dom and Ria.  I mean, you know, we may be a small town, but.  But hey, you're getting Charlie Daniels.  And how do you give away the concert tickets?  Uh, well, let's see.  Do you do anything crazy or you just ask for a call?  No, we always do something.  Unless we have a whole lot of tickets to get rid of in a hurry, we do something with them.  Like what kind of contests or whatnot would you have to give tickets away? 
[01:32:00]  Let's see.  With the Charlie Daniels, which was the last one, we made people sing, you know, the whole.  Yeah, they sing the Charlie Daniels song.  That's cute.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You want to know what we did for instinct tickets?  I'm afraid.  Where's everyone going?  Wait.  I'm very scared.  And come back in here.  I can't be part of this.  We're just being honest with Susie.  We're not trying to be outrageous, but we're just telling her, you know, we're trying to  get to know our new friends down there in Mississippi, Anthony.  All right.  Go ahead.  Hey, Susie, could you syndicate our show down there for a night? 
[01:32:30]  Could I?  That would be huge.  Oh, yeah.  Like that could happen.  What do you think, Susie?  You're the boss.  Oh, well, you know, there's always a possibility.  I can fit you in between Mississippi State Baseball, probably.  Mississippi State Baseball?  Yeah.  All right.  Listen, this is what we did.  We had a pair of instinct tickets to give away.  Yeah.  We had a gay guy come in.  Oh, my God.  All right.  You know those queer folk?  No, we don't have those.  No, there's nothing like that down there, right?  No, absolutely not.  Yeah.  What do you think of the whole gay issue? 
[01:33:00]  I have...  Sorry.  I have no opinion.  You have no opinion.  No, I'm a fence rider.  What can I say?  A fence rider.  What's a fence rider?  I take no side.  Yeah.  Oh, no, but you have an opinion.  All right.  I'm afraid.  I'm very afraid.  Susie.  Maybe an opinion you're not going to say on the Tim, Him, and Her show, but...  You know what I'm talking about, Susie.  All right.  Come on, Susie.  All right, got me on that one.  Okay.  You don't like the queers?  Well, I don't know any.  That's right.  But I have seen some. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  Get Gay Marco on the line.  Can we send her off?  You should see some of the queers we got up here in the New York City.  Really?  God damn.  So one of them came in.  He's a good friend of the show.  His name's Gay Marco.  He's never been with a woman before.  He wanted to go to see NSYNC really, really bad.  Okay, Susie?  Okay.  So we came up with this wacky little contest.  Hey!  Where we had Gay Marco eat the peach of a 19-year-old girl. 
[01:34:00]  You know what we're talking about when we say peach, right?  Yeah.  Susie, now hold on.  Okay.  Don't hang up.  I'm hanging on.  I know you're swaying here.  I am.  I'm very nervous.  You're making me really nervous.  Let me tell you something.  He had to do it for the...  Now, I'm figuring you'd like something like this because it did nothing but torture this  here queer boy.  And I gotta tell you, he was never... 
[01:34:30]  That was the first time he was with a woman.  Never even kissed a woman.  Never felt one up.  And you made him eat a peach.  Eat a peach.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  For the duration of an NSYNC song.  You should have seen him just crying like a little sissy queer boy.  We were laughing.  You tortured that poor man.  Well, man, you'd use the term loosely.  We're talking about a...  Okay, does he have lace on his panties?  Lace on his panties?  We don't know.  They all do.  Do they?  Susie.  Well, see, I don't know.  We don't have any. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, well, up here in New York City, they walk around the streets in women's clothing.  You can't walk two feet in New York City without bumping into one of them queer boys.  Oh, yeah?  They all got what you call the AIDS.  Yeah, we don't have that either.  No, of course, because you ain't got the queer.  Nope.  No queers, no AIDS.  No queers, no AIDS on Hog 95.  No, no, never.  Goddamn.  I got to move down there.  I cannot believe you can get away with this on the air.  We'll see how that pans out by the end of the show. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, boy.  We're trying to get Gay Marco in line, but...  Yeah, Gay Marco is the only gay guy that has been on this program.  Mm-hmm.  Susie, I'm starting to think that this is big news for you and your radio station  talking to us in New York City.  Well, sure.  Yeah, okay.  All right, I guess we've got to let you go for now.  Yeah, for now, but we would like to keep in touch with you.  You send us some T-shirts and whatnot, and we'll send you a couple.  Do you have a website or anything?  Because I would like to wear a W-O-N-A shirt around here,  because I'm sure a lot of people now will know what that station is, 
[01:36:00]  and I'll wear the shirt.  Sure.  Well, great.  I'll send you some.  Do you have a website?  No.  No.  No, but we are online.  Wait a minute.  You're online?  No, not literally online.  No.  Would you like to give out your personal email address, Susie?  No, no.  I'm sorry.  I wouldn't do that either, Susie.  I reserve that.  That's a very, very good idea.  You can email us at hog95.1, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's the email address for hog95?  H-A-W-G-9-5-1-at-network-one.com. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, my God.  All right.  The Internet hasn't come to your town yet, obviously.  It's still very new over there.  You still have the dashes and stuff.  It's very slow.  Right.  I got that little 14-4 modem.  And we have a good machine.  Okay.  All right, Susie.  Yeah.  Machine. 
[01:37:00]  That infernal machine.  Right.  Susie, play us another sweeper from W-O-N-A.  I can't write this second.  Oh, no?  Why?  I don't have local news going.  Ah.  Sorry.  Can we hear the local news?  I don't know how far into it we are.  Hang on.  All right.  Just pop it up.  We'd love to hear a little.  We have Representative Bobby Howell on the line as our representative from Jackson.  Are they talking about the flag?  Yes, they are.  All right.  Let's hear.  Okay.  Let's hear a little about the flag issue. 
[01:37:30]  Flags and fags.  Big issues.  It's very clear that if you vote for one, you'll be voting for our original flag that has been  in question, or you'll be voting for the new design.  The balance will be very clear about that.  And also, a part that I like is having a prohibition in this bill against the alteration  of any historical monuments in the world that a lot of organizations have expressed concern  and we might be changing.  How much of that do you want?  Yeah, it's kind of hard to hear, actually.  Is it?  Yeah.  Sorry.  You guys are voting between the old flag and the new flag. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  Well, a lot of guys up here in New York in love with Susie's accent.  Oh, no.  Really?  Are you a married lady?  Almost.  We can say that.  Almost.  Yeah.  Tim or him?  No, neither.  Okay.  I was wondering if maybe you were making bacon with one of your co-hosts.  Oh, no.  Never.  Okay.  No.  Making bacon with your employees.  Never.  All right.  Listen, we're going to let you go for now, okay?  Okay.  All right, Susie.  Yeah, let's exchange addresses and stuff because I would love to get a t-shirt. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on, Susie.  All right.  Thank you.  It's been a pleasure.  Thank you.  I enjoyed it.  All right.  Very good.  There goes Susie from W-O-O.  W-O-N-A.  Hog 95.  You got to love it.  I love that whole small town thing they got going there.  Now, get Stinky back in here really fast before we take a break.  Stinky.  Go.  Get over there.  You have to go to this guy.  Yeah.  You got to go.  That'll be fun.  What if you went with someone you knew so you felt a little safer? 
[01:39:00]  I feel weirder with like a...  But we have like a truck driver that's ready to give you a ride.  I know.  I know.  But you'd have to go with somebody.  Yeah.  It'd be nice to go with someone I know.  Who would you go with?  I'd go with Mark.  But that would be...  You'd scare him.  No.  You can't go with Mark.  No.  You have to go with Psycho Mark.  You use your tongue prettier than a $20 whore.  Who's this?  Hello?  I think we lost him.  All right.  There was a truck driver.  If he's still listening, call us back.  And there she goes.  She's...  Susie is now gone. 
[01:39:30]  Holy smoke.  They hate the queer, man.  They sure don't like the gay people down there.  We just got used to the niggers.  That's what they're saying.  You know, she wanted to be open-minded with the blacks.  You know?  Because Opie says the word colored.  And they're talking about the flag issue and everything.  And you know, oh, that's horrible and stuff.  But God damn, you bring up them queers.  They're ready for our lynching again.  God damn, where the hell's the lynching? 
[01:40:00]  All right.  We'll put up with the niggers, but we ain't taking the queers.  Holy Jesus.  And Salomino, you know we have to have Stinky hit the road.  How funny will that be, man?  Stinky road poor.  Stinky, he'll have a digital camera.  Maybe take a dat recorder.  We'll have him on the show for the entire trip.  How do you think Charles Kuralt got started with his on-the-road series? 
[01:40:30]  Remember Montana crotch rat?  It's not often you see a Montana crotch rat, but today we'll leave you.  I'm Stinky reporting from Winona, Mississippi.  A small town.  The small radio station.  And boy, do they hate the queers.  Seems they just got used to the negro here.  What with all the racial tension, but bring in a fag and they're ready to start the lynchings again. 
[01:41:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  It's a Mississippi fag muskrat.  It's not often you see these.  Hi, I'm Stinky reporting from Winona, Mississippi.  We'll leave you.  The sounds of queers.  Sounds of queers.  Being beaten with sticks here in Winona, Mississippi.  Hey!  Hey!  Sure, they had to accept the colored, but they'll never take the queer. 
[01:41:30]  I hear if they have to replace the flag, the old Union Jack southern flag, they want to replace it with a dead faggot.  Hey!  Try that one on for size, Winona.  Impossible!  Stinky reporting live from Winona, Mississippi.  Now the sounds of a cross burning. 
[01:42:00]  As we leave you on this Sunday morning.  We leave you.  Accepting the negro, hating the queer.  Stinky live.  Winona, Mississippi.  W-O-N-A.  Hog 95.  Hey, is she going to send shirts and stuff?  She's got to send a whole package.  She's got to send the sweepers and everything.  All right.  Guys, how do I get home? 
[01:42:30]  I've already busted.  Maybe do a five-year stint for a joint.  Cops very angry.  All I could say was, thank God I'm not a queer.  Because you think they treat the pot smokers and the Negroes badly.  You ought to see the way they treat the faggots.  Charles Kuralt, me, stinky.  On the road.  Hey!  You know, we got a problem with our little idea here, though. 
[01:43:00]  It's going to be very...  One problem?  It's going to be very easy to get stinky to Mississippi.  One of our listeners is going cross-country or a truck or whatever.  How's he getting home?  How's he getting home?  We can fly him back.  The adventure is getting there.  And then the adventure is coming back.  What are you going to fly me with?  A crop duster or something?  Yeah.  Strap in!  I think it's Susie's dad.  He flies the plane, too.  Out of the airport.  Strap in!  We have to do this, though.  I'm dead serious.  I think it would be hilarious. 
[01:43:30]  You'll have the digital camera.  Shut up!  You'll have a little picture, Tyree.  We'll leave you with the sounds of Winona, Mississippi.  Celebrating Martin Luther King Day.  Wait, wait, wait.  Holy crap.  That was so friggin' funny. 
[01:44:00]  People from Winona, Mississippi upsetting Vinny the Racist.  I don't believe you.  It was so funny how she was, like, offended by the black stuff, yet she's like, well, I'm a rebel.  Oh, yeah, how accepting they were.  I'm a rebel at heart.  Yeah.  I'm a rebel.  The new battle for the South against the fags and queers.  Yeah, the AIDS thing?  We ain't got that down here, Nathan.  And we don't want none. 
[01:44:30]  Keep the goddamn queers away!  What you boys doing?  Goddamn 40s, Sheriff.  Yeah, great.  Well, I think we made a new friend.  Don't you, Opie?  Yeah, I think so.  We're gonna have to have Susie on from time to time, Anthony.  We leave you with the sounds of Winona and W-O-N-A, Hog 95. 
[01:45:00]  The next man makes a move, the nigger gets it.  I'll leave you with the making bacon show.  Spear checker.  Oh, oh, help me!  Here's Earl in Winona.  Help me!  Help me!  Help me!  Oh, Lordy Lord, he's desperate.  Do what he say!  Do what he say!  Leave you with Tim.  Stock that chink a day's pay for napping on the job. 
[01:45:30]  Yes, sir.  Ha, ha, ha.  We leave you with the sounds of Winona.  I heard you people try to get a little crackly, not to jump around like a bunch of Kansas City faggots.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Those men wanted to have sex with me because you're a faggot.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:46:00]  Wow.  Ha, ha, ha.  Okay.  That is great stuff.  I got it from a Negro.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right, Ann, we got to take it right.  Yes, of course.  Woo!  Making bacon show.  Queer free.  Ha, ha, ha.  We're running queer free today.  W-O-N-A.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right, we got to get Stinky to Mississippi and back. 
[01:46:30]  That's our next goal.  Ha, ha, ha.  If anyone's going to be heading cross country in the coming couple of weeks.  Let us know.  Let us know.  The best is when you're there and realize you have no right back.  That's going to be hilarious.  Thanks.  Today on Unsolved Mysteries, The Disappearance of Stinky.  Did you see that one?  No one knows where he ended up.  Disappearing on a lonely road.  Ha, ha, ha.

[02:12:30]  hold on get his info just in case um anthony you've been doing some research and i still am opie okay um  right now i'm on uh one of the uh winona websites i went to the event calendar it's empty i swear  there are no things happening maybe a sneaky will be lucky enough uh to be in town when someone dies  let me see if uh winona has any local news nope nothing going on there oh my god residents 
[02:13:00]  maybe they have their own websites and stuff uh no nothing nothing but i did find some stuff out  about uh traveling there okay um you go to  when no well hold on let me just get this in new york it's going to take him about 22 hours 
[02:13:30]  to get there if they drive straight straight through okay which uh you could do that i've done that  you know do that to florida you just got to drive straight you don't stop um most of his drive  well how many miles is it it is we figured out the mileage uh 1197 miles and uh most of that is on  i-81 it's 525 miles is on that then he's got like a 90 or 100 miles on i-78 
[02:14:00]  there's 82 on uh i-75 there's 284 on i-59 so uh you've got some long halls in there  and then of course uh the wonderful us-51 which will take you right into the heart of industrial  winona which i i punched up the entire town on the map there's nothing there
