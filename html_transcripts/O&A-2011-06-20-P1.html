<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with Opie recounting his Father's Day sunburn from a golf outing with Rich Voss, leading to extended mockery of Voss's attire and perceived attempts to get freebies.  This segued into a discussion of Opie's Jewish deli-style Father's Day picnic, sparking debate on kosher food and a restaurant's alleged discriminatory practices.  The conversation then detoured into a discussion about the merits of milk and kosher dietary laws, with caller Eli from Virginia offering clarification.

Next, the hosts criticized NBC's omission of "under God" from the Pledge of Allegiance during the U.S. Open, lambasting their apology as disingenuous and launching into commentary on political correctness and censorship.  They praised Rory McIlroy's U.S. Open performance and his pointed avoidance of mentioning Tiger Woods.  The segment concluded with Anthony describing Danny's diving injuries in his pool, a discussion of pool temperature preferences, and a mention of *Jaws*' 36th anniversary, prompting childhood anecdotes.  Rob Bartlett's appearance on Imus in drag was briefly mentioned. Jimmy and Danny were present in the studio during this segment.

A substantial portion focused on the underpaid producer Sam, with the hosts expressing outrage at his low salary compared to Howard Stern's.  They recounted Eastside Dave's departure after a similar salary dispute and discussed a former employee's unsuccessful attempt at a large raise and partnership. Eric's lottery win and the ensuing accusations were recounted, as was the Howard Stern/Alex Bennett confrontation. Ant discussed his podcasting compound, and Jim Florentine shared a story about childhood molestation.  Steve Cerniello joined via phone.

Anthony Weiner's resignation was extensively discussed, with debate over the humor in the situation and comparison to Alex Bennett's reaction.  Amy Winehouse's poorly received concert in Serbia was also covered.  A large portion of the show targeted E-Rock, focusing on his physical condition, perceived negativity, and work ethic.  Steve Sterniolo from Raw Dog joined the discussion, offering further commentary on E-Rock.  The death of Clarence Clemons was mentioned, including a humorous anecdote about a Springsteen Christmas video.

Further ribbing of E-Rock continued, with mentions of Club Soda Kenny.  A discussion regarding a principal spanking students on their birthdays led to a call from Jess, Sam Roberts' fianc√©e, sharing a similar childhood experience.  Sam Roberts' DNA test results were revealed, showing mostly European ancestry.  The show also included listener-submitted "F.U." messages, a discussion of Bobo's stand-up routine, and news about Fez's name change and coming out.

A phone interview with Bobo followed his poorly received comedy set, resulting in the hosts' harsh critique and advice.  The news of Ryan Dunn's death prompted a somber discussion, revisiting Clarence Clemons' death as well.  Archived audio featuring Tippi Tom, including a comedic "prostate exam" by Dr. Steve, was played.  Anthony later called, furious about Tippi Tom's use of his chair and microphone.  Vanessa Williams was briefly mentioned as being in the studio. The hosts also mentioned giving away NASCAR and Mets tickets, and the running gag of Bill Tedley was briefly referenced. The show ended with further discussion of Dunn and Clemons' deaths.  Bobo, Dr. Steve, and Eric and Roland were guests at various points during the show.

Finally, a repeated segment announced the show's broadcast schedule from Monday through Friday, 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern (with some mentions of 11 a.m.).

[00:04:00]  Thank you.  Let's welcome our host, Opie and Anthony.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, I got fucking burnt on the golf course.  Did you?  Yeah.  I don't get out much.  I don't get out much.  I said, you know what?  I'm going to enjoy the sun a little bit.  You'd think I would have learned from having some pre-pre-skin cancer burned off my hand.  I went non-fucking-suntan lotion yesterday.  I played golf with Rich Voss as part of my Father's Day festivities. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, my dad.  You didn't call your dad yesterday?  I thought of it yesterday.  I'm going to call him.  I had something to do.  I just called Father.  Oh, whoops.  Yesterday was the day to call him.  I know.  I'm still terrible with that shit.  I slept at 4 o'clock yesterday.  I am terrible.  He picks up a pen and goes, oh, fuck.  Call Dad.  Call Dad.  Write it down.  Yeah.  I have a very bad memory.  And if people are talking about it, I'm like, oh, yeah.  Oh, right.  Father's Day.  Yeah.  Rich Voss wants everyone to know that he plays golf very well.  For some reason, he can't take jokes or something. 
[00:05:30]  And he's a jokester, isn't he?  I think so.  When we make fun of his golf game, he goes, I don't like that you tell everyone,  I suck on the golf course.  He was being serious.  Look what he was dressed like yesterday.  That's his loud mouth pants.  He should apologize to the gay community for impersonating one of them.  That's like when you have the option to change clothes in a golf game, a video game, and  you just pick the most wild, outrageous thing so that people laugh at you.  You get crazy.  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  Why would he dress like that?  That's what Rich is wearing.  For what?  Golf.  But why?  I'll give away his scam.  You want to hear?  Yes.  It's kind of brilliant, actually.  So, you know, Voss, it's kind of brilliant.  He pretends he has Down syndrome and they let him play for free?  Hear me out.  It's kind of brilliant.  I'm telling you.  All right.  This guy is addicted to golf.  We all know that, right?  Yeah.  He traded one addiction for this golf thing.  So, he travels the country doing his comedy, but he's traveling the country to really play  golf courses.  He almost doesn't care about comedy anymore, even though he's still funny on the comedy stage, 
[00:06:30]  but he'd rather do this.  I'm telling you.  He gets a gig somewhere he can golf.  But he walks into morning shows.  This is brilliant.  Dressed like that.  Yeah.  Now, you as a radio show host go, wow, you have to comment about his crazy pants.  And he goes, oh, these?  He makes believe like, oh, he goes, these are my loud mouth pants, which is an actual  company brand.  Yeah.  So, he gets the clothes for free.  Oh, of course.  And then the radio guys go, well, why are you dressed like that at six in the morning?  And he goes, well, because I'm playing Blah Blah Country Club, which is the local golf 
[00:07:00]  course.  Oh, is he just a plugging ass?  So, he gets the clothes for free and the golf for free.  I'm saying he's brilliant.  And I'm saying that he's-  Without making it sound like this big over the top, you know, let's talk about my golf.  They casually mention it.  Yeah.  He's selling himself for a free golf game.  Right.  Right.  Hey, Voss, how about you think like an entertainer?  How about you get some money or an endorsement deal?  You think Michael Jordan would do that?  Like, you picture Michael Jordan going on a fucking TV show with a pair of shoes and 
[00:07:30]  putting him up Leno's on his desk?  What are those?  Yeah, just hoping that the company calls you and says, yeah, here's a freebie.  Ground fees are expensive, man.  How much is it to play golf?  Well, I didn't have a county card, all that bullshit.  Who gives a fuck?  I'm not from Jersey.  So, I had to pay 80.  He paid 50, I think, 55, because he had a card.  What card?  I don't know.  Are you part of this county card thing?  Do you know what it is?  Is it a recreational card?  I don't know.  It's probably the same thing like the recreation pass that you need in Nassau County. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Why do I have to pay more?  Because I'm not a resident.  I'm paying you.  I'm here.  Hey, you're coming in to use their facilities.  Oh, that's right.  You're paying for it.  Right.  Exactly.  I'm filling up your golf course.  I'm helping your business out.  How about you help me out a little bit?  The county wants their cut.  Do they?  Yeah.  Little bastards.  But Voss shot an 82 yesterday.  I barely broke 100.  And Voss made me a sandwich.  Oh, he did again?  And you know what?  As much as I make fun of that motherfucker, I had to be out of the house at 630. 
[00:08:30]  Because, you know, why play close to where I live when we can play a mere 10 minutes from  where Rich lives?  Oh, of course.  And my father-in-law came up from Philly.  So we're all driving like lunatics at 6, 630 in the morning to get to play golf with  this fucking idiot.  That's rich.  So I'm starving on the course because, you know, it's too early to eat and we're trying  to tee off.  And by the fourth, fifth hole, he goes, I made you a sandwich.  And I want to beat him up and tweet it and make videos.  I'm like, just give me this sandwich.  I'm going to pass out of here. 
[00:09:00]  What kind of sandwich was it?  Turkey, salami, and provolone.  That's not pretty good.  On some kind of Jewish flatbread.  Wow.  Why don't you just throw acid reflux in your mouth instead of drink it?  Jesus Christ.  Did you have coffee with that?  And then he also goes, and I got you a granola bar, too, for later.  Oh, that's thoughtful of Rich.  I know we've done this break, but it's every time I play golf with him.  He has a little, like, iced pack bag with all his sandwiches.  He thinks he plans it out ahead. 
[00:09:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  What's, like, the best part of Rich's game?  Is it the drive?  I forget.  Was he the irons?  The fact that he could have a heart attack doing it.  I kept saying to him, oh, you dubbed that one.  He doesn't like the word dubbed when you're playing golf with him.  Because he doesn't really dub things.  Yeah.  He might push a shot or something, but I'll go, oh, you dubbed that.  And he gets really mad.  What's that mean, dubbed?  Dubbed means you just suck.  Oh.  You know, I mean, if you push or something, it's pretty much, you got the club on the 
[00:10:00]  ball, but, you know, it's not straight or whatever.  A dub means you almost fucking missed the thing.  Like, does he drive far?  Is he, uh...  He...  See, he doesn't like...  He doesn't want me to make fun of his golf game, but I'll tell you this.  He has a horrible swing.  Really?  My swing is much better, and I don't put up numbers like him, you know, but my swing is  much better.  His swing is horrible.  Really?  Well, it works, so...  You know how you're supposed to take the club, you know, back somewhere like this?  He takes it back like this. 
[00:10:30]  Barely takes it back.  Even on the drive, yeah?  Yeah.  And then comes through it really hard.  But it works for him.  Huh.  You know, so...  Yeah, some of them guys bring that club back where, you know...  Oh, like a monster.  The club head is over there, fucking left shoulder.  Exactly.  Wah!  Yeah.  Yeah, where it could...  Yeah, no.  You see that.  He's got a horrible swing, but he's played for so long, he knows how to work it, I guess.  So, it was fun.  I was telling him, Father's Day is...  It's like another birthday. 
[00:11:00]  This is my second one, but the first one, the kid was, you know, what, a couple weeks  old or whatever?  Yeah, yeah.  But this is like another birthday without having to worry about getting older.  What'd you get?  I get...  Sentimental stuff.  What'd you get?  Sentimental stuff.  A nice book with a lot of pictures in it, right?  Books, pictures.  No, but it's, you know, a lot of pictures of us and stuff.  So, your wife made a book, like a family photo album.  Yeah, really nice, actually.  Took a lot of time.  Then some desserts and cards and picnic in the park and stuff, so... 
[00:11:30]  Picnic in the park.  Calling all the fathers.  You had a picnic in the park?  Yeah.  What'd you eat?  And then everywhere you go with your kid, you hear, Happy Father's Day.  Happy Father's Day.  Happy Father's Day.  We went to a Jewish deli and got like a picnic basket.  Do you really want to hear this?  Picnic basket?  Of course I do.  Do you really want to hear this?  Of course.  Of course I do.  I'm redder than the sunburner guy.  Yes.  And then we just chilled out in Central Park.  What kind of desserts?  It's in the picnic basket.  It was a nice, just a stupid Jewish fucking sandwich with Jewish pickles and Jewish crap. 
[00:12:00]  And I don't even like the Jews.  But I like their food.  Their sandwiches.  No, I like the Jews.  I'm just kidding.  Jews have fucking phenomenal turkey legs.  Jewish deli around us.  I order turkey legs.  I know they're probably fattening with the skin.  It's so good.  Lansky's?  No.  No, I forget what it's called.  It's not that though.  The one on 72nd?  I only order from them.  I've never been there.  There's a Jewish place. 
[00:12:30]  I'll get into this for a second.  There's a Jewish restaurant, kosher, close to us.  We like going there because the food is really good, but they hate us because we're  not Jewish.  And I will fucking stand by that statement.  Yeah, they only want fellow Jews to come in.  Well, we sit at a table and they will not wait on us.  When you give them some money at the end, they're like, what are you doing?  Exactly.  We get extremely slow service.  I know what that's about.  They want this restaurant to just be for the local Jew.  Are they all Orthodox? 
[00:13:00]  No, but they're Jewy Jews.  I don't like...  And it's a popular restaurant.  They have one downtown.  So this is known, I guess, in the Jewish community.  Right.  There's a Jewish place on Columbus Avenue that's for everybody.  They don't care.  But this one place, I'm telling you that they care.  We've stopped going there.  I don't like kosher places because they have the certain things they don't serve.  Yeah.  Like you bless the thing before you cut it to the throat.  What the fuck is that?  You can't get any ham.  That bugs me.  You can't get like...  No ham?  You get potatoes?  No dairy products, right? 
[00:13:30]  No dairy.  No pork.  I know pork, but I mean, dairy annoyed me.  Do we have any Jewish listeners?  I think it's dairy too.  Well, I hope not.  You know the same two we'll call.  Exactly.  David.  David from Israel.  Yeah, from Israel.  The dairy...  Oh, is that why my apple pie sucked yesterday?  Oh, made with no like...  I'm going to guess so.  Sure.  It's probably made with weird...  I don't know what they...  I don't know what filling was, like two inches thick. 
[00:14:00]  The crust that would...  I guess would be the crust part was...  How can I explain this?  It almost had the...  It almost looked like homeless skin.  Oh.  Flaky?  Yeah.  Flaky and thick.  It's smelly.  Just...  So is that why?  Because they don't put eggs in it?  Maybe.  I'm not sure what they use.  Oh, their apple pie sucks a dick.  I love apple pie.  Eggs is...  Eggs...  I think they could do eggs, can't they?  Why would you go to a Jewish deli for apple pie, though?  No, it was part of the... 
[00:14:30]  Part of the picnic basket.  I know.  There's a million good dessert places.  Part of the picnic.  Did you put out a little...  Did you put out a little blanket?  No.  No.  No.  You did.  No, it was a big round blanket.  Big round blanket?  Oh.  Now, I don't know.  Maybe that is why...  That's...  Sam's bringing up Torah stuff.  Yeah, why are we doing this?  I'm just...  This was a quick throwaway.  Okay, hold on.  As far as they were to fucking picnic.  The oral Torah explains that this passage prohibits eating meat and dairy together. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, okay.  The rabbis extended this prohibition to include not eating milk and poultry together.  Why?  In addition, the Talmud prohibits cooking meat and fish together or serving them on the same plates  because it's considered to be unhealthy.  It is, however, permissible to eat fish and dairy together,  and it is quite common, lox and cream cheese, for example.  This is like the fucking riddle about taking the fox, the rice, and the chicken across  without having one eat the other.  Can we eat the dairy but cook the fish? 
[00:15:30]  What are you doing?  The one part of that statement, you went eating milk and poultry, and you said,  why?  That sounds horrible to have a glass of milk with your chicken.  It's the best.  But chicken...  No, it's not the best.  No.  Not all of us are eight years old.  You're talking into thin air.  You're in a microphone.  How is that the best?  Chicken and milk?  Maybe chicken fingers where it's not chicken anymore.  White meat, chicken, and milk is really good.  No, it's not.  No, it's not.  You should try it.  Do you drink a lot of milk?  Yeah, well, I have like one glass of milk every day.  What a douchebag growing boy. 
[00:16:00]  Exactly.  I hate that shit.  Fucking asshole should carry his plants and try to fuck whatever her little name was  in the professional.  You guys realize it's...  Natalie Portman.  You guys realize that Sam's closer to 30, right?  I know.  You're not a little boy anymore.  It's calcium.  When you started with us, you are, but calcium's important.  It is, but milk is probably not that great for you.  It's meant for fucking little cows.  Yeah, baby cows.  Baby cows.  It's just 1% milk, so it's not that bad in terms of like whole milk is bad, but it's 
[00:16:30]  a good source of calcium.  It's a calcium pill.  Yeah.  Have a Diet Coke.  Shut up.  There's plenty of places for calcium.  Have some aspartame, you fucking Peter pumper.  Exactly.  Milk.  Peter.  I'm tired.  I love that.  But milk outside of breakfast and dessert, there's no need for it, Sam.  If you have a glass of milk with dinner, it's bad.  All right, then have it right now with breakfast.  Or maybe later with some chocolate chip cookies.  Do you have milk and pizza?  No, no, no. 
[00:17:00]  That's crazy.  That is hard.  That's a little much.  You want a Jew to explain the kosher thing?  I would, yeah.  By the way, ice cold milk I can tolerate, but then milk starts to smell.  Oh, God, yes.  It just sucks.  It makes your breath horrible.  It dries your mouth out.  It's terrible.  Milk is fucking icky.  You leave it out for five minutes.  It starts curdling.  It's fucking horrendous.  What's wrong with milk?  Yeah, it's terrible.  Milk needs to just be cold all the time.  Exactly.  Or it freaks out.  Well, you need to have hooves and suck it out of a cow's tits like baby cows do. 
[00:17:30]  I had milk and poultry last night.  It was great.  Milk and poultry.  Sounds like a fucking rap group.  Why don't, why don't, this is going to be, why don't, like, why doesn't milk get sour  when it's still in the cow?  Because it's, no, I'm not even going for one of those dumb jokes, but why?  Because the cow is warm the whole time.  That's true.  Is that because it's not pasteurized or something?  Not exposed to air, maybe?  Maybe not.  Why doesn't it get sour constantly?  It probably could.  I think that's why they got to, like, keep milking those fucking cows. 
[00:18:00]  Keep fucking that chicken.  Do they just ice the cow's teats to keep it nice and cool?  That is a good question.  That is a good question of the day, why?  That doesn't make sense to me.  Gamey animal smell.  As soon as you take it out of the damn cow, within minutes it'll start fucking going bad,  right?  And it's just, you know, there's shit all over those udders.  Because cow shit goes everywhere.  They're just blasting that green crap everywhere.  Because they're just dragging their udders in the pasture.  Picking up all sorts of bacteria.  And fat cows. 
[00:18:30]  Cows.  Colin had a funny line in his special about how we kill, eat cows.  Because they're just so honest.  They don't pretend like dogs pretend to be happy and other animals and cows just stand there.  Yeah, they do.  Fucking looking miserable.  Yeah, fuck it.  Put a bell on them.  Shoot a ball through my head, I don't care.  Yeah, the mistake that cows made is looking so sad.  It made it easy to eat them.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  This is the famous Dennis Leary bit.  We don't eat anything that's cute.  If a cow was cute, man, we probably would have fucking saved the cows. 
[00:19:00]  I've got those big eyes.  Probably not, though, because that steak is wonderful.  It's lovely.  They take the tongue and just start licking their nostrils.  Yeah.  You ever see that?  They do...  The tongue goes right up their nose.  I wish I could do that.  That would save me...  Cut out the middle man.  I was going to say that.  Cut out the middle finger.  That would save me a lot of time.  Can't get there.  Can't quite get there.  Eli from Virginia.  Are you a J?  I am a J.  Eli.  But how much of a J are you? 
[00:19:30]  I'm a fucking horrible J.  But I was raised Jewish.  I went to Hebrew school when I was a kid and stuff.  But ever since I had apartments when I was 13, I've pretty much done nothing since.  Can you explain the kosher...  I understand religions have a lot of dumb things they do, all of them.  But what is the limits on...  Why can't they have milk in a kosher deli?  It's actually milk with red meat that you're not allowed to have.  And it's any dairy products in red meat.  It goes back to the possibility that you end up eating an animal with its mother's milk. 
[00:20:00]  And there's very strict preparation rules also.  So a place that prepares any kind of red meat cannot prepare any kind of dairy products in the same place.  What the fuck is the difference if you eat an animal with its mother's milk?  What does that mean?  I eat a fucking bacon cheeseburger all the time.  No, no, I know.  I'm not saying that you created the fucking Old Testament.  I'm just curious as to what does that mean.  So the Irish Jew can't have a cheeseburger?  Oh my God.  What's wrong with you people?  You can't have a cheeseburger. 
[00:20:30]  Cheeseburger.  Hamburger.  What are you getting?  I don't understand what it means, though.  Why can't you have something with its mother's milk?  I don't get what the meaning of that is.  I don't either.  Religions are stupid.  They're ridiculous.  I'm not just saying the Jewish religion.  Religions are stupid.  There's too many exhausting rules.  Thank you, sir.  He had nothing.  He just said, hi, I'm a Jew.  Goodbye.  We need help, sir.  Actually, he gave us a little info.  I guess.  I just don't get it, dude.  I've developed such a dislike for all the religions, though. 
[00:21:00]  Every time I see a picture of the Pope, I want to fucking rip the paper.  Well, I got something to play for you, speaking of religions.  Where the fuck did it go, though?  Did I throw it away?  Where was the under God thing?  Oh, it was in the player.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  During the U.S. Open?  Yeah.  That stupid Bob Costas and the over-the-top just fucking production piece to make it more than it is.  The U.S. Open, if you're a golf fan, it's like, wow, it's one of the majors. 
[00:21:30]  This is cool.  I'm going to watch this.  And then Bob Costas has to just bring everything completely over the top.  Make it that over-dramatic beginning.  Is he known for that?  I guess he is now, right?  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  Why can't he just fucking be the guy and just fucking, all right, time for the U.S. Open.  Here's the announcers.  Let's move forward.  He ain't going to do that.  But they had this dramatic, I'm not sure if this was the Open.  I guess it had to be the Open.  The beginning. 
[00:22:00]  It was the beginning of the U.S. Open.  And they had a bunch of kids doing, you know, the Pledge of Allegiance.  Yes.  With fucking all sorts of visual elements.  It was interspersed.  Soldiers.  Yeah, exactly.  So they would do, like, you know, I pledge allegiance.  And then you see a bunch of other stuff.  And there's some sounds.  And then back to the kids.  To the flag.  Blah, blah, blah.  And then there's more dramatic crap.  So as they were going on, they, for some reason, just left a line out.  Yeah, listen to this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I pledge allegiance to the flag. 
[00:22:30]  Present.  Ho.  Of the United States of America.  And to the republic for which it stands, one nation.  Order.  Ho.  Ho.  Ho.  It's liberty and justice for all. 
[00:23:00]  Oops.  Yeah.  Where did under God go?  It's absolutely not a mistake.  Oh, no.  Of course not.  Yeah, that was not an error.  Well, they've since apologized.  No, they purposely left it out.  Did you read their sanitized, and I was twittering about this.  I was up last night just fucking going ballistic.  It annoyed me so much.  This thing?  It drove me nuts.  Yeah.  Um, did anybody read their sanitized apology? 
[00:23:30]  No.  This is, it might be in the story that Danny sends out, or Travis, or I sent it.  There's an apology, and it's everything that's, there's not one ounce of sincerity.  Well, apologies are just ridiculous at this point.  They're not real anymore.  No, they're so overused.  They're based on nothing.  They're so overused.  Yeah, based on nothing.  No sincerity.  They're really based on nothing.  Yeah, because you have to be careful how it's written.  Right.  I don't know.  So you don't offend someone else with your apology.  I don't see it. 
[00:24:00]  There's going to come a time where people are going to be apologizing for their apology.  Yeah.  Uh, yes, I apologized, but...  Look up the apology, it's out of one of the stories.  You know, or go to the Drudge Report.  Yeah, we'll find it, but, um...  It drove me, it's such a sanitized bullshit apology from NBC.  Me and Ann were talking before the show, when the Pledge of Allegiance happened when we were  growing up, I always thought it was hilarious, even as a little kid, when the one kid had  to get up and raise his hand like, oh, I can't be here for the Pledge of Allegiance.  I don't believe in this, so I'll be in the hallway. 
[00:24:30]  So one, you know, godless kid would have to go in the hallway while we did the Pledge  of Allegiance, and then he would have to awkwardly come back in, like, oh, I feel  we don't believe in God.  Just try to let him read it.  All right, you could come back in.  Right.  All right.  But I was telling Ann, like, half the kids that were doing the Pledge of Allegiance,  even though the one, quote, godless kid had to leave the classroom, the kids that  stayed in the classroom, they weren't even, like, doing the God thing for the most part.  Half of them probably didn't even go to church or know what it meant or anything.  It had nothing to do with a kid.  It was his parents that were like, don't you stand for the Pledge, man. 
[00:25:00]  What, were those Jewish kids?  Were there Muslim kids that we just didn't understand about Muslims yet?  No, I think they were more atheists.  Just atheists in general?  Yeah, anti-government kids.  Yeah, because I think the Jews in my class, they stayed.  Yeah, they were there.  They stayed in the room, right?  They believe in a God.  No, it's not Jews at all.  Jews are not like that.  Yeah.  With the Pledge.  That's probably just atheist or agnostic parents or anti-government parents or whatever.  Right.  Anti-religious feelings.  I just always thought it was funny because the kid had nothing to do with it. 
[00:25:30]  It's obvious that the parents had a meeting with the principal.  I don't want my kid in that classroom when God is being spoken.  What is this fucking computer problem?  Sam is trying to find, the apologies right here.  It's like a little paragraph.  And Sam has been trying for five minutes, ever since we started, to click on it and the  screen.  What is the matter with the internet connection?  Well, I guess we got to tell the guys down the hall.  Have we yet?  Is the computer slow?  Yeah, have we?  Why is it slow?  Oh, it's been brought up? 
[00:26:00]  I don't know why it's slow.  I did not know that.  Aren't these new computers?  No.  I thought they got us new.  All right, there.  Here's the sanitized, this is the non-lawyer, of course, positive.  Sincerity at its finest.  We began our coverage of this final round just about three hours ago.  And when we did, it was our intent to begin the coverage of this U.S. Open Championship  with a feature that captured the patriotism of our national championship being held in  our nation's capital for the third time.  Regrettably, a portion of the Pledge of Allegiance that was in feature was edited out. 
[00:26:30]  In fact, it was not done to upset anyone, and we'd like to apologize to those of you  who were offended by it.  That fucking puke lawyer speak.  That's horrible.  Regrettably, a portion of the Pledge of Allegiance that was in the feature, not one ounce of fucking  just plain English and honest speak from any of these cocksuckers.  Yeah, what does that mean?  It's regret...  What is regrettably?  It said it was in the feature, but it was edited out. 
[00:27:00]  So, it was in there.  They edited it out, and hopefully, yeah.  Hey, we're sorry that somebody made the stupid decision to pull the words under God out.  It was in a...  How about you say what you took out?  And indivisible.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because it's under God.  One Nation, under God.  Indivisible, and then they went right to with liberty and justice.  Oh, okay.  Oh, I didn't realize it either.  Yeah, I didn't realize it, because I never was able to say that word.  Indivisible.  It was always invisible.  I went with invisible.  One Nation, under God, invisible, because you didn't know what indivisible meant as a kid. 
[00:27:30]  When you blurted the pledge out, half of it, you just didn't know as a kid.  It was just sounds.  You were just making sounds.  You know what?  Awesome for bringing it up, because...  Did you see what Joe Rogan tweeted about the Pledge of Allegiance?  No.  This might piss off some people, because it is...  Certainly, it's a bit political.  But the widest kids you know, Pledge of Allegiance, he tweeted this.  Listen to this.  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. 
[00:28:00]  Thank you very, very much for letting us little kids live here.  It really, really was nice of you.  You didn't have to do it.  And it's really not creepy that little, little kids mindlessly recite this anthem every day  and pledge their life to a government before they're old enough to really think about what they're saying. 
[00:28:30]  This is not a form of brainwashing.  This is not a form of brainwashing.  This is not a form of brainwashing.  This is really the greatest country in the whole world.  All the other countries suck.  And if this country ever goes to war, as it's often what to do,  I promise to help go and kill all the other countries' kids. 
[00:29:00]  God bless Johnson & Johnson.  God bless GE.  God bless Citigroup.  Amen.  Very good, kids.  That is hilarious.  Rogan tweeted that a couple weeks ago.  That's hysterical.  But it goes to your point, obviously.  Yeah.  We didn't know what the hell we were saying.  I used to say, you know, I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.  Even as a kid, I kind of knew what that meant. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  Although allegiance was a little like, I don't know what that meant.  I don't know what allegiance.  United States of America.  And to the republic, and then I thought, for which it stands, was one word.  For which it stands.  It was for which it stands.  Right.  I don't know why.  To the republic for which it stands.  One nation, under God, indivisible, not a clue.  No.  With liberty and justice for all.  But for which it stands.  For which it stands.  That sounds like one of the new countries after Russia broke up.  Yeah, which it stands. 
[00:30:00]  Are we pledging to one of those Russians?  We're pledging to which it stands.  Oh, no.  That's not good.  The poor people of which it stands.  The poverty they live in.  But they do really well in the Olympics.  Yes.  Which it stands is great in the.  They're great in hockey.  Ice hockey.  Female gymnasts.  And female gymnasts.  Yes.  Very, very good.  Watch out for which it stands.  To the republic for which it stands.  Right.  Because I had no idea what the fuck you're saying.  You are just blurting out crap.  Allegiance, you know, that indivisible.  Indivisible. 
[00:30:30]  I could have a clue.  What does that mean?  It sounded like invisible.  And you knew what that was from watching cartoons.  Yeah.  But indivisible.  I didn't know what that meant.  I thought it was invisible meaning like no one could really touch us because they really can't.  Invisible.  They couldn't see us.  Yeah.  We're here, but ha ha.  Not literally, but you know what I mean, like, yeah.  Yeah, figuratively speaking.  Saying, wow, we're invisible.  No one could really fucking find us and do harm to us.  The republic.  That's like fucking some Star Wars shit, yo. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, yeah.  Pledge your allegiance to the republic.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  Well, so that U.S. Open thing is just, Bob Costas has got to go and they shouldn't do shit.  Overly dramatic.  You know what?  You can't edit that.  Then don't do that piece.  I agree.  There's a million other little, like, dramatic pieces you can figure out.  You can't just chop a piece out of the pledge.  If you're doing something with the pledge, then you can't chop a piece out.  Not that I give a flying fuck.  And the only reason, and that's just some dummy at the network that's not thinking very well.  Because it's like, U.S. 
[00:31:30]  U.S. Open.  Let's do a big over-the-top country piece with the military and stuff.  I think there's an agenda there.  I agree.  Without a doubt, that's on purpose.  There's an absolute agenda there to cut that out.  Absolutely.  You don't think some intern is sitting there cutting it up just going, you know, it's a huge network, huge thing.  And they give him the responsibility to cut out under God.  Oh, I understand.  There's some big network head that decided to edit that.  Yes.  But my point is saying is that golf has nothing to do with that piece. 
[00:32:00]  They're trying to make that connection.  U.S. Open, right.  Just because it has U.S. in the title of the tournament.  You know what I mean?  It's a stretch to begin with to go in that direction.  Maybe for the Olympics or something.  They love that pride thing.  I would love to know who conceptualized that bit and if they did it with the ultimate idea of purposely taking that out.  Taking the God part out.  And I don't say that in paranoia, but you're right.  That doesn't tie in. 
[00:32:30]  No.  It's not really a good tie.  I wonder if the same person that did that knew back that they were going to take that out as a fuck you.  The purpose of the whole piece was to just take that out like a fuck you.  It's one of the majors, but it's the same guys playing from all around the world.  Just because it says U.S. Open, they went in that direction.  I don't know.  They're the same network that just got mad at Tracy.  It's funny what's appropriate and what's not appropriate.  So it's all you people. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, whoa.  You might be honest.  Maybe they're a little, you know, fucking what trigger.  Help me out.  A little radical.  A little trigger happy.  Maybe a little radically in one direction.  No, because they're a little nervous with the whole Tracy thing.  Like, oh, we don't want any more controversy.  No, the same mentality.  So let's get the God thing out.  The same mentality that would.  The same.  And it doesn't mean that gay people don't believe in God.  I'm not saying that at all.  But the same side of the spectrum that would want Tracy crucified is the same side that would agree with removing it. 
[00:33:30]  Right, because I think a lot of their problems come from religious people with the Bible and the whole thing with gays and the Catholic Church and bleedy, bleedy, bleedy.  But, yeah, that would make sense.  Cut that out.  That under God part.  Get rid of it.  That's the danger, by the way, of censoring stuff like that.  It's not just words like faggot now or nigger or the seven dirties.  Now God is deemed inappropriate by somebody at the network. 
[00:34:00]  No one gets off scot-free.  It's like everyone's sacred cows are going to get fucking kicked.  If you start subscribing to that at all, it's all or nothing.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  That is odd.  It is this weird.  If they don't put the word out there, it doesn't exist anymore.  Who the fuck are these people to be arbiters of what we should hear?  It's not an FCC violation.  Any of these words.  No.  It's amazing.  Nope.  It's just amazing that this is going on.  Do you know how lucky we are to have this fucking... 
[00:34:30]  Like, literally, on the way in today, I was thinking of how lucky we are to...  We have, like, little stops that we put on ourselves.  But to be able to sit here and just fucking blast this stuff...  Yeah, it's the listeners that are unlucky.  Yes.  It's anybody whose ears are subjected to this garbage we call ours.  Garbage.  It's fucking...  Earwax.  We're very lucky to be able to fucking...  I'd rather have earwax in my ears than...  I'm sure you do.  You can do both.  And I'm usually exclusive.  Fucking waxy motherfucker. 
[00:35:00]  It should be noted, this McElroy just fucking destroyed at the U.S. Open.  Yeah.  And he's the one that had the huge collapse.  The new kid.  Well, he's been around a few years.  And this guy...  This McElroy is the real deal, by the way.  This isn't a fluke thing where, you know, he finally...  Oh, yeah.  This guy is going to win a lot of fucking tournaments.  He is that damn good.  And he's the same guy, if you remember, that, you know, fucking fell apart at the Masters.  Yeah.  I mean, in a horrible way.  Well, he didn't do this time.  No, he wasn't going to let it happen twice. 
[00:35:30]  He should have won the Masters and this, which is two majors in one year is damn impressive.  Yeah.  And he's only 22.  And he beat the field by eight plus strokes.  Second place was eight strokes behind him.  That's crazy for a PGA event.  Crazy.  And he set all sorts of records that are pretty impressive.  Tiger who?  People are starting to say, Tiger fucking who?  Well, when he got the trophy, he was given a statement on how great it is to think that  he's now in, you know, on that trophy with the names like, and then he said a few of 
[00:36:00]  the golfer's names, Tiger never came up.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Good for him.  He mentioned, you know, some of the greatest and never even...  Wow, he didn't mention Tiger?  Never mentioned Tiger.  He probably should have.  I shouldn't say good for him.  What's that about?  He doesn't like Tiger, apparently.  Yeah, but you got to respect what he does on a golf course or has done.  On a golf course?  People are weird, man.  That's good.  Let's bring the whites back to the golf championships. 
[00:36:30]  Come on now.  Bushwood?  A black person at Bushwood?  He kind of looks like Danny a little bit.  He does, Noonan.  A little bit.  He does look a little like Noonan.  I thought that.  A little bit.  He actually looks like the angry pig from fucking Angry Birds or the pig.  Oh, the pig.  The pig from Angry Birds.  He kind of has a piggish fucking nose.  Good for him, though, man.  I like watching him play.  So, McIlroy just destroyed.  How was your weekend, Ant? 
[00:37:00]  Great.  Yeah.  Great.  Yeah.  Nice Friday.  Just hanging out.  The weather was great.  Then Saturday, Jimmy came over.  Yes, I did.  Late at night after his sets.  Yes, and Danny was over, and I guess Danny decided to leave his face print on the bottom  of my pool.  He dove off the waterfall, and I think he went a little far left. 
[00:37:30]  Dude, that's how you break your neck.  Is that right?  Yeah, yeah.  He dove in and put his arms out, but then when you're going to swim up, you put your arms  to your side.  You're now swimming.  He was still going down in the pool, and I went, wham, just smacked his face.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  Got up the next morning.  Look at him.  Wow.  You all right?  When you came in, I didn't even notice.  I didn't think you scraped your whole fucking face.  That's what I was saying.  You skimmed the pool with him?  I thought he just got his forehead.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You came in and said hi and dropped some stuff off. 
[00:38:00]  I didn't even notice your face is beating up.  His glasses covered up a world of hurt.  Yeah, I guess so.  Holy shit, y'all.  What?  I'm fine.  It looks so much worse than it is, really.  You look like Vicky LaMotta.  Yeah.  Seriously, it looks like someone punched me in the face five times.  Yeah.  That's what it really looks like.  It's all around your eye, on your forehead, and then over your eye, under your eye, and  then the bridge of your nose is just really, really fucked up.  You tweet that, or what?  That is hilarious.  Nah, we just like to fuck it. 
[00:38:30]  That's up to him, bud.  That's how people break their neck.  You all right?  Yeah, well, it was my own stupidity, of course.  Holy shit.  Yeah, the second my kind of, like I dove in, and I gave like one stroke, let's say, and  I really just shouldn't have done that.  Yeah.  And I just kind of felt my face just hit the bottom, and I was like, ooh, that's a good  one.  Like a torpedo.  Yeah.  But like, it didn't hurt that bad, and it was just like, it lumped up a little bit,  but I didn't expect it to look so ridiculous.  No, the next day, it just was like, what the fuck happened to you?  It was actually a suicide attempt. 
[00:39:00]  I was just tired of hearing you two in the goddamn hot tub.  Me and Jimmy just babbling.  Yeah.  All wet like men.  Yeah, and then the next day, I had family come over, and oh.  Next day, meaning yesterday?  Yeah, that was yesterday for Father's Day.  The entire family came over, and I was just a disaster.  My head was pounding.  You were hungover?  From drinking so much red wine.  Red, red wine.  Red wine is a horrid hangover.  Yeah.  Horrid.  I've gone back to beer lately, when I do drink. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't like the fucking red wine hangovers anymore.  So I had to have the medicinal glass of beer, which is tricky, because three swigs, and you  could either start feeling better, or you're going to puke your guts up, and it actually  made me start feeling better, so I just continued that, and had a great time.  Had the family over for Father's Day.  You know, now I get his little kids running around now.  With a pool, you've got to constantly watch. 
[00:40:00]  Holy Jesus.  That is just, even me.  Like, I'm not the fucking parent, but I'm constantly looking.  You know, I'd be the defendant, so I'm really looking.  It's like, eh, keep that kid away from the edge.  Watch it, watch it.  Get her floaties on.  You know that, all right.  They're in the floaty state?  The floaties.  We're the floaties.  That's what we should have had on on Saturday.  Danny needed floaties, so he didn't smash his face.  Wart it around my neck?  Yeah.  Right, your neck. 
[00:40:30]  Damn.  Yeah, so it was a good weekend, though.  Weather was great.  It was nice, huh?  Nice warm weather.  Yeah.  But again, I made the mistake of leaving the pool heater on a little too long, and then the  sun was beating down on it, so I think the pool was 88 degrees.  Isn't that too hot?  I know you were arguing with people on Twitter a little bit about it, but isn't that too  hot?  Yeah.  It is.  I'm in the camp of, that's too hot.  I'm not going to deny it.  So I turned the waterfall on full blast, and all the bubbles in the jacuzzi, so it spills 
[00:41:00]  over, and it kind of cools it down, because it's kind of going through the air.  And that worked a little bit, but for the most part, wow.  It was hot.  What's the ideal temperature for you?  I know it's going to be a little warmer than most.  I like pool high 70s.  High 70s.  What does that feel like?  It's nice.  It's warm, but it's not bathtub warm.  You get that slight, like, ooh, I'm in cold water.  No, I don't like that at all.  I want to be able to, when I go in a pool, I want to march down those stairs, just go 
[00:41:30]  dump, dump, dump, right in, without any, oh, oh, like, you know, the crotch stop, where  you got to wait and get your dick in, and then the nipples stop, and then the shoulders  stop, you're like, huh, huh, no, fuck you, but hate that in a pool.  Why do we do that to ourselves?  You're in the pool, and you're trying to make yourself taller, and you suffer for about  five minutes, and then finally dip in, and it's the same crap as if you just jumped in.  Yeah.  It really is.  Some people go, no, you're actually kind of cooling your body down a little bit, getting 
[00:42:00]  it used to.  I don't want to feel the cold like that.  And on a hot day, people are like, yeah, but it's hot out.  Don't you want to be refreshed in the pool?  Like, no, the water is good enough, and then when I get out and lay down on one of the  chairs lounges or something, then it's nice.  You get a little breeze, and you're like, ah, now you're in the sun, but you're cool.  Mm-hmm.  I'd rather have that than jump into a cold fuck pool.  I hear you.  I want the water to be like the Caribbean.  Don't go to the ocean, then.  No, the ocean's fuck you.  Not around here. 
[00:42:30]  Not in New York ever will I go to the beach.  After the 4th of July, it's not that bad.  Nope.  Still fucking cold.  Too cold for it.  Too cold for me.  Don't like it.  And there's monsters.  Monsters in the deep.  Dark, gray water off of Long Island.  I'd rather go down to, you know, St. Martin, something like that.  But blue, turquoise, blue water.  You've never been to St. Martin?  Yeah, I've been to St. Martin.  Oh, through the cruise ship thing?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh.  How is that?  It's nice.  We're not doing radio.  St. Thomas.  We're not doing radio right now.  I just need to know.  Ah, shit. 
[00:43:00]  Is it good?  Oh, fuck.  I want to go.  St. Thomas is really nice.  Yeah.  It's just fucking, and the water's so fucking warm and blue and nice, and the sand is very  crystal-y.  You don't walk on a goddamn beach, and it feels like you're walking over coals.  It's terrible.  You're on punji sticks.  You constantly feel like you're stepping on crabs.  Yeah, crabs, pieces of shells.  But it's not even half the time.  It's just rocks that now have fucking whatever, the algae and little barnacles.  Yeah, rocks.  There's muscles. 
[00:43:30]  It just feels like crab heads.  I don't want to walk on food.  Right.  Yeah.  It's horrible.  I like going to the ocean.  I don't mind the ocean.  The North Shore beaches of Long Island I like.  Oh, those are terrible.  It just smells like low tide all the time.  And the South Shore beaches, yeah, the big waves and stuff, but it's a scary, dark, blue-ish,  gray color.  You see when the wave breaks, and you can look through it, and it's green.  Sometimes you see fishies.  Yeah, you certainly do.  From the beach, not from the water. 
[00:44:00]  Speaking of monsters, 36 years ago today.  Yes, the release.  Fucking Jaws was released 36 years ago today.  36 years.  I remember that.  Oh, shit.  It brings back a father memory.  He brought us.  We were all just little nothings.  I don't even know, man.  I don't think we were old enough to see Jaws, but I guess he wanted to get the fuck out  of the house.  Sorry.  Totally distracted by Rob Bartlett.  What is he doing today?  Oh, my God.  Who is he dressed as?  He's dressed as a woman.  I know, but... 
[00:44:30]  And he's got everything on, like makeup and lipstick and a wig.  He's playing with his wig.  I don't know who he's supposed to be.  Who is that supposed to be?  Um, the singer, who's that fucking Naomi Judd?  One of the Judds?  No, because they have red hair.  He looks better as a woman than a guy.  I looked up and I actually thought it was a fat woman talking.  And it's Rob Bartlett on Imus' show dressed as a woman.  But who is he playing?  He looks like some old Yenta woman.  Imus is chatting with him. 
[00:45:00]  From the ranch.  I'm doing it.  I was broadcast from the ranch.  Blah, blah, blah.  I think I've got to go out there.  I'm old.  Yeah, you're going to go to the ranch?  I think I committed to something I really didn't want to commit to.  Yeah?  Yeah, I was talking to him at that thing we did.  With the I-Mountain.  And he...  The ranch.  I said I'd like to go check out that ranch.  And he said, like, I'm going to take you up on that.  So I'm just scared.  I'm going to get the call.  And any time you want to come down there and check out the ranch room, feel free.  It might have been one of those open invites, so I might be okay. 
[00:45:30]  I just hope he doesn't call and go, well, how about this weekend?  They're in.  By the way, can you ride a horse?  Take 30 cancer kids out and teach them to ride a horse.  Because I don't need this shit anymore.  I don't know.  Who's Bartlett playing?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Now they're doing all characters.  They've got that.  Oh, God.  Tony Powell.  Yeah, Tony Powell is doing Jesse Jackson.  Is that who that's supposed to be?  Yeah, he's got his fake mustache on.  Was Bartlett trying to do Sarah Palin, but he's too fat? 
[00:46:00]  No, because his hair was short.  No, the hair was short.  I'm going to ride him.  He didn't have the glasses.  It's like, yeah, who were you supposed to be?  Or were you just more comfortable coming to work like that?  Exactly.  They're just afraid to say anything now, and the whole Tracy Morgan thing.  Yes, they can't acknowledge the fact that he now comes in dressed as a woman.  Yeah, I'll write.  Or is there something you want to tell us?  Yeah.  Bartlett's great, man.  Wait.  Oh, it was.  Anyway, Jaws 36 years ago today. 
[00:46:30]  Yes, 36 years.  Brings back a father memory.  We all, really quick, me and my brothers were watching Jaws and my dad.  And I've told this a few times, but we had a huge thing of popcorn.  This is a true story.  I'm not even fucking pumping up for the radio.  It's not that big of a deal of a story.  But remember when the fucking head pops out of the boat underwater?  Oh, Ben Gardner's fucking head.  Yeah, sure.  And remember the whole fucking theater's like, holy shit.  Yeah.  Or was it when the shark popped out?  I don't remember the exact memory.  Shark popped out of what?  When Ben Gardner, his head popped out with the eyeball. 
[00:47:00]  Shit.  Hanging.  That was the biggest holy shit moment in a movie back then.  It was.  The theater fucking screamed.  I think it was that moment, or it might have been when Jaws pops out of the water.  First time, you try to come down here and chum this shit.  So now the story, whatever.  But he was looking down and grabbed popcorn, looked up just at either one of those moments,  which are two big moments in the movie, and fucking threw the popcorn.  Threw the popcorn in the air.  Everywhere.  He lost it. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Or is there, okay.  I had, when I was in California at the time, when Jaws came out, and there was a drive-in  movie theater we used to go to, and we kind of became friends with the manager of the theater.  Right.  And he rolled up the Jaws poster for me.  I was like, here you go, because I thought the shark looked cool.  And of course, through my irresponsibility, I lost it. 
[00:48:00]  An original Jaws movie poster.  Oh, my God.  Go on eBay.  They're probably not that valuable.  They're probably not that much, but a real original.  Oh, my God.  But I think the real key here is there's something Anthony's probably blocking out about what  led up to him earning that poster.  Ah, yes, true.  Might have been the same as Jim Florentine in his wrestling pictures.  You know, we talk about flow charts on this show.  Yeah.  Jimmy's flow chart leads to molestation every fucking time. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, that's true.  And then you make us all think, like, wow, fuck, is he on or something?  Let me think a little harder than I've ever thought before.  Yeah, you're right.  Everything goes to molestation with you.  Did you have a happy childhood?  Right.  Yes.  Yes.  No.  Right.  You were molested.  That's the Jimmy Diamond-shaped flow chart.  We all have a dumb flow chart.  That's great.  Wait, did anybody before I forget read Florentine's tweet about how he fucking Twittered that the  guy who was sitting next to him on the plane was, like, a fat fuck or something? 
[00:49:00]  And the guy was a fan and then looked at him and goes, really, dude?  He had read his tweet.  No way.  Ah, nailed.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, that's when you notice.  You know, I'm sitting next to him as a fat fuck.  And the guy was like, really?  Really?  No way.  I was the guy.  That's hilarious.  Hilarious.  Yeah, it was really embarrassing.  Oh, that's funny as fuck.  Yeah.  That Twitter is becoming pretty popular.  Jaws posts on.  Most of our listeners have Twitter now. 
[00:49:30]  You've got to watch it.  It happens a lot now.  Original 1975.  Original linen-backed film poster.  $595.  $2,000.  No.  Okay.  That's different.  Yeah, that's one you should get for the compound.  A nice Jaws poster.  Oh, yeah.  Definitely want that.  That would be kind of cool.  Hells, yeah.  How many posters you got up right now?  I don't have any up yet.  I haven't rolled up, but I'm waiting for the right light boxes to hang up.  I only got like three that I want to hang up. 
[00:50:00]  Why are you waiting for the right light boxes?  You can't get them or they don't exist?  Yeah, they're kind of hard to find.  I got Ange on it.  She's on the motherfucker.  Hard to find light boxes?  Yeah.  Yeah, the right ones.  Wait, are they going to be behind?  Like when you turn the light on, they just go on?  Or are they going to be battery operated?  Well, some of them, I'll probably hardwire them in.  Have them hardwired into the electrical system.  But some of the posters I have aren't light box posters.  Like you ever see a light box poster?  It looks like if you turn around, you see the reverse image because light actually shines  through the poster.  Oh, I never know. 
[00:50:30]  There's that type.  And then there's the type that just is a poster that needs a light on the outside.  So backlit.  A light box is backlit and it comes through the poster.  Oh, that'd be cool.  And then there's other ones that have the top light like a piece of artwork or something.  I didn't know the difference.  So, yeah, I'm working on that.  I got a lot going on down there these days in the compound.  What?  Yeah, Bartlett and fucking right back.  Vincent might know, though.  Vincent in Connecticut.  Vincent.  Yes.  Vincent.  Rob Bartlett is playing Megan McDowell. 
[00:51:00]  It's one of the Fox Broad sisters, pretend sisters.  Okay.  Come on.  You don't watch a non-show every day?  We can't hear it, though, because we're doing this.  We have it on one of our ATVs.  We're on the radio.  Wait.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  Why is he going with an obscure character today?  I don't know.  Because he wanted to dress like a girl for fruit.  I got nothing.  I'm punching out.  Well, they actually had something.  You'll let us know.  All right.  Let me say hi to Frank in Indiana. 
[00:51:30]  Frank.  Hello.  Oh, Frank was better.  Yeah, guys.  Hey.  Hey, Opie.  You like uncomfortable moments.  Of course.  You ought to replay some of that phone call from Anthony calling up special delivery this  past week.  Oh, boy.  I heard rumors.  I've never seen somebody be bald like that in front of their woman before.  It reminded me of that Louis C.K. episode where he was getting ready to get his ass kicked  by that punk kid.  That's basically what Anthony was doing to Sam.  Why would you do that to young Sam? 
[00:52:00]  It was a bit much.  Well, I was listening to the program.  I appreciate that much.  I was listening to the program.  And like any program that Sam hosts that I'm listening to, I get outraged.  Why were you getting outraged?  Just at him talking on the air.  Just the fact that he has on air time.  Yeah.  It outrages me.  It's on your channel.  And I know.  Thanks.  Thanks for the reminder.  Which means we get to work less.  Yeah, I know.  That was kind of cool.  So you're kind of torn here, huh?  I did go off.  And I do apologize, Sam. 
[00:52:30]  I mean, I might have been a little.  Three sheets to the wind?  Yeah.  That was probably one sheet with the maid bringing the other sheets on the way.  You're on your way to three sheets?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What the fuck does that even mean?  It's the weekend.  Don't tell me because I don't want to know.  Tell me to Jess what a good life he had because he had made it and he was making money and  how I was akin to a little kid at a police officer's desk with a policeman's hat on.  A hat on.  So I was licking an ice cream cone. 
[00:53:00]  Yes.  That's funny.  And that I would never make it.  And that I was sure to be a disappointment.  Yep.  And that you felt more sorry for her than a dead person's family.  Oh, yes.  Wow.  Well, we did get into that whole thing.  She understands that would be a little uncomfortable.  She knows she's marrying a flop.  Of course she does.  But you know what?  She's very loyal.  Yes.  Now, what's Bartlett doing up on CNN?  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, wait a minute.  That's a real woman.  Well, really?  I don't know. 
[00:53:30]  If you had sex with that, I think you'd be considered...  Gee.  A little of the gee.  She could be the ugliest woman on TV.  You'd be considered a bullfucker.  Why'd you put your dick in that bison?  It talks.  What, Frank?  Don't forget about the constant offers of basically sex coming back to the compound.  Yes.  Yes.  I was soliciting his fianc√©e for sexual favors.  He invited her back to the compound and said not to have sex unless that was something you wanted to do. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, I wasn't going to pressure her.  Right.  Like, I wouldn't rape you, but...  Right, but it...  Yeah.  If, you know, we'd probably end up...  Once you're here, it probably would be rape.  Right.  How did she handle it?  I mean, she was polite.  She was nice.  You know, I hope...  But I would love to know what her true feelings were, but she's a very nice, polite girl.  Yeah.  She's a trooper.  And very loyal to her, Sam.  Oh!  Very loyal.  She doesn't want to realize she's wasted these many years.  Yeah.  It's almost like when you buy a car, you're just like, I can't fucking believe this is a lemon. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  You don't want to...  I'll hang on to it.  It's just a pain in the ass to change now.  And that's right.  You'll never make it here.  Here or in the business?  I think you'll make it in the business, but this place is not set up for young guys...  Here on earth.  No.  For young guys to come up and get real money and real positions.  Yeah, I mean, I'm not attached to this...  They don't give a fuck about, like, new people here.  I'm not attached to this company, per se.  Really?  With your fucking 20 different shifts that you do on 18 different stations?  Well, if somebody else gave me a better offer, I'd be gone in a heartbeat. 
[00:55:00]  I would hope that everybody is aware.  Yeah.  It's a crime.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You can beat them up all you want, but...  It's a crime, the lack of money Sam makes for everything he does for his fucking place.  It's crazy.  It's a fucking crime.  He's a good soldier, and that's all they care about.  They can get away with it.  What do they care?  You just like the airtime.  Well, I mean, it's getting to a point where it is getting a bit insane.  You're recording all this stuff?  Yes.  A lot of air checks?  Everything is recording. 
[00:55:30]  Equity and air checks, my friend.  You guys start calling other companies.  You think so?  Maybe they'll take you seriously here.  I think I have to get a concrete offer before anybody will even realize what my name is.  We should have concrete shoes.  See, that would have killed them.  I'd be dead in the water.  And a concrete hat.  It could be a brick to your skull.  You should look at a child labor laws.  I'm serious.  Because you're still technically a child, and the amount of hours you're putting in here  and the amount of money you're making.  I'm technically a child?  Yeah.  How do they put up with that down the hall? 
[00:56:00]  How do they sleep at night?  They love it.  Knowing what they do to you and most people around here.  Stuff those pillowcases full of cash and just doze right off.  How do they sleep?  It helps them sleep at night.  Let's walk through it.  What's your position on this show?  I don't even know anymore.  Producer.  All right.  So you're a producer on The Opie and Anthony Show, which is a pretty fucking big radio show.  Sure.  Then you do overnights for Hits 1.  Well, I also am the filling guy.  Like this week, for instance, I'm doing 12 to 5 all week.  So he became the overnight guy at Hits 1, but he's also the number one filling guy. 
[00:56:30]  So now he's doing real shifts.  Afternoon drive, midday.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Afternoon drive.  So that's a full-time on-air position for Hits 1.  Plus he's a producer for The Opie and Anthony Show.  Plus he does his own show.  Plus he hosts one of our hours now.  Yeah.  We used to do five hours.  Now Sam has one of those hours.  And they will not give him money or give him a raise.  No.  When you add it all up like that, it really makes me look like an asshole.  Yeah.  It's disgusting.  Well, it's not an asshole.  More as a sap. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  Like a...  A doormat.  Like, look what we could do to this.  Yeah.  Look at this kid.  He'll do anything.  He's happy to be here.  Yeah.  And they'll go, we're making progress.  Everything is making progress.  We're making progress on a lot of phones.  Hey, we're watching what you're doing.  We are.  Hey.  You're on your way.  Hey, we...  Wait, could you...  We've taken notice.  Yeah.  Don't you worry.  You're doing it for the show, so don't worry.  Okay.  What are some of the things they have said that makes you feel like, wow, if you were  stupid, you would actually buy into their corporate management bullshit. 
[00:57:30]  All this stuff that you're doing, it's all really good for you, man.  This is all going to pay off.  This is great experience.  It's great to have you.  I mean, just to be in all these different areas.  It's so good for you.  By the way, a lot of people your age paying to get the experience you're getting for a  paycheck.  Yeah.  That's right.  You can segue this into a career in terrestrial radio.  Which is dead.  Where the fuck is he supposed to go?  He's making no money.  What is he supposed to do?  What's the point I'm making?  It's ridiculous.  But they don't.  Like, they know that there's not a giant terrestrial radio. 
[00:58:00]  All right, so now I'm you.  Yeah, exactly.  They know he has nowhere to go with this.  Now I'm you.  Well, that's all well and good, but I can barely pay my fucking cable bill.  When is a raise coming for me?  Help me out.  We're working on that.  We're definitely...  I mean, it's always...  They've been working on this for a long time.  Like, they can't do it themselves.  I can't do it myself.  If I could do it out of my pocket, I would.  What's the argument they give you about not...  What is the argument against anybody getting raises?  Like, no one gets them?  By the way, we're using Sam in this position, but the fact is, because there's other guys 
[00:58:30]  that work for the show that haven't had a raise in a really long time, half this fucking  building hasn't had a raise in a really long fucking time.  Oh, yes.  So it's not just Sam, by the way.  We're just using him for this example.  I mean, because they know that the alternative, if you really push, for instance, like what  Eastside Dave did, they'd be like, okay, then quit.  And they'd be like, no, really, quit.  That bothers me to this day.  Dave was just looking for money because he couldn't afford to come here anymore.  He wasn't looking for this crazy over-the-top raise so he could buy a really nice house. 
[00:59:00]  It was so he could pay to get here.  And he did what I...  He was losing money to do the show, so he basically said, I need a little pump, you  know, I need a little jump in salary.  And he said, look, based on the work I'm doing, I'm not doing the work, I'm doing much more  than what you've hired me to do.  Right.  My duties have changed, so, which is basically the same thing I would do, which would be  basically have the same results.  He'd be like, oh, you'd be so out.  No problem.  Out the door, buddy.  Yeah, yeah.  Just let a guy go that's pretty fucking talented that wasn't asking for much. 
[00:59:30]  They don't mind.  It's just...  They don't mind.  He's not a celebrity.  They don't mind.  They don't mind.  They don't let you go.  Well, logically, where do they think all this is going to lead to?  Celebrities.  They love celebrities.  They love celebrities, and they love cheap paying employees very little.  Very little money.  The guy that left, what was he asking for?  Did he officially leave?  The guy who's going to leave?  That we're talking about?  Oh, oh.  We're not saying his name, but he...  How much more is he asking for, do you know?  Is it more than 10,000 a year more? 
[01:00:00]  Well, he decided to leave based on, like, he was leaving.  Like, he asked for...  His demands for staying were ridiculous.  Okay.  Because he was...  He said, I don't...  He said, I'm leaving.  I'm done.  So he went over the top and just said, look, I want partnership.  I want 51% ownership in the stock.  Yeah.  I want...  He went all in.  Yeah.  But that was based on a lot of years of not getting...  A lot of years, yeah.  You know, taking care of properly.  Yes.  So that's what people do now.  It wasn't like he was, like, you know, felt really good here and doing really well, and 
[01:00:30]  all of a sudden, he just got greedy.  It was just like, I'm fed up.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, good for you, Sam.  Making no money and doing a showload of...  Sam's right, though.  If you go to them, there's nobody that they won't let go.  Yeah.  And I know that, and you know that, so when you can't bluff them, you have to be ready  to walk.  They do like the fact that nobody is indispensable at this place.  Like, they will look at anybody and say, well, you can go.  But they're replacing these talented people with less talented people. 
[01:01:00]  With just anyone for less money.  And eventually...  They see it as a great opportunity to give someone less money if they bring someone new  in.  One of the guys we're already paying, we'll just add on to their responsibilities.  Right.  Yes.  No more money, so we just saved money.  We just saved an employee's money because we'll just lump his responsibilities on people  that are here already.  Yeah.  I'd love to know if management here takes...  Like, if they get a promotion.  Like, let's say you're doing A, and then you get promoted to B. Do you get a raise with  that promotion?  Or do you go, hey, great experience? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You get a fucking raise.  You get a title.  I know.  You get a new title.  A new plaque for your desk, perhaps.  A bigger office, maybe.  I don't know.  But as far as money goes, hearty har.  A lot of guys have gotten better titles without the cash behind it.  A lot of good titles.  The managers?  In management?  No, management.  That's why I'm talking about management.  Oh, they take care of each other.  I'm saying in management, they make sure...  I read their bonuses.  It's ridiculous.  They get paid.  But, you know, they figure it out. 
[01:02:00]  You know?  I can't fault them.  If you're going to figure it out.  Yeah.  There's something called just doing the right thing sometimes.  How to run it on the cheap.  Oh, yeah.  That's what they do.  They know how to run it on the cheap.  This isn't a developmental system here.  It's like a video game.  If this was like SimCity, but only based on this, the money would be rolling in.  Right.  But then everybody would be...  With big exclamation points over their head.  And then garbage would start piling up in the hallway.  You didn't hire your janitors because you're like, I don't care. 
[01:02:30]  Because you're looking at that money.  They're all angry.  Your employees are angry.  Shut up.  And they just go...  Doesn't matter.  Yeah.  They'll find other gigs.  Doesn't matter.  Oh, my God.  One of your top talent is suing you.  Oh, who cares?  Doesn't matter.  Who cares?  Doesn't matter.  Don't handle it.  Just hit the time lapse.  Let's see what happens.  Let's go forward 10 years.  Let's keep going.  Everybody's yelling.  I love that. 
[01:03:00]  You're right.  Oh, this was supposed to be paradise.  It's not that complicated.  It really isn't that complicated.  I don't know what Sam's supposed to do to get a normal salary, I guess.  Yeah, I don't know either.  Work a little harder, you son of a bitch.  Pick up a couple of shows.  Pick up a couple more shows.  You ever walk in and just go, what else am I supposed to do? 
[01:03:30]  I've never literally had that conversation, but there has been moments of exasperation.  But it's also like, you look at the person that you're talking to and you know that they  can't do anything because they just bring it to their boss who brings it to his boss.  That's why I don't really do it.  So many levels of...  So you're just like, what am I even talking about?  There's no accountability.  That's why I politely deal with those guys.  And once again, I'll say it.  It's not their fault.  They're wonderful people.  They're wonderful.  They're wonderful people.  They don't pull the financial triggers, though. 
[01:04:00]  When they talk about kicking things upstairs, it's like, I have no idea what that is, where  it goes.  Does it ever make it there?  You never hear back from upstairs.  It's like just this mysterious thing upstairs.  And nothing ever really gets dealt with.  Like, you just had this long conversation.  You just really pitched yourself.  You put everything on the table.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, we're going to bring it upstairs.  We're going to bring it upstairs.  I can't believe I just wasted all that time.  I've never been upstairs.  Oh, man.  I don't know what's up there.  I feel bad for Sam because now he's going to have to talk to one of the polite guys and 
[01:04:30]  they're going to come to him and go, no, we're really making progress.  No, we do.  We're making progress.  We do talk to them upstairs.  It's like, who are they?  It's a collective.  Yeah.  It's a conglomerate.  I mean, special delivery has only been on the air once a week for like two years now.  So it's the next, the big steps around the corner.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  They're working on it upstairs.  I can just keep doing it for free.  No problem.  Oh, yeah.  I look up at the ceiling when they say that.  Like, really?  Things are happening just like a couple of feet above us right there. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  It's amazing.  It's great.  I can't wait till I hear this.  How's the compound?  Making some changes?  Beautiful.  I was showing it to some people.  Wow.  Making some changes?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You need a Saturday show?  I got all the, I will work on programming after the facilities are completely built.  A lot of Pete, my carpenter guy and my general contractor guy brought in all the plywood  and some of the beams and shit, two by fours for the platform. 
[01:05:30]  All the wire's going to be run underneath, so nothing's all.  Is it a fire hazard or no?  Crazy.  Nah.  No equipment, just the wiring is running in there.  What do you surround the wire?  You don't put that on the rug.  What do you put around the wires?  You put insulation in there and kind of insulate it.  You don't have rats, do you?  No.  You put raccoons under there just gnawing on wires?  Gnawing at the wires.  And gnawing at the wires.  Nah.  And for the most part, it's going to be just low voltage audio wires, things like that. 
[01:06:00]  Mic wires and whatnot.  But yeah, it's that.  I got lighting trusses going up, big fucking things like that we got holding the TVs up  and shit.  Yeah, I got those on the ceiling.  That's awesome.  And I got to go to the Jews at B&H and get some lighting for my green screen and key light  and everything.  And before you know it, it's going to be beautiful.  That's awesome.  Yeah, it's great.  There has to be a way to monetize it, and there is a way.  It's just not 100% yet, but it's going.  Too many people are doing podcasts now. 
[01:06:30]  Where it's like now everyone's aware of podcasts and people are using them.  It's not like it was two, three years ago where it was like, well, if you have one, maybe  some people will listen.  All the guys who have them now are doing pretty good with them.  It is the next thing.  But in Ant's case, it's not totally about the money either.  No.  No.  You know?  No, but I mean not now.  We have that luxury, thank God.  Yeah, yeah.  In the future.  Yep, the future.  I'm looking not now.  I'm looking a couple years ahead.  Yeah, the luxury is, yeah.  It's not totally about the money, but it will lead to money. 
[01:07:00]  There needs to be some kind of a uniting of a few good shows to put on one maybe sponsored  or subscriber-based platform where you have like a, instead of having to subscribe to,  you know, Rogan's podcast and Adam Carolla's and this and that, it's all in one spot.  Well, we were heading that way here.  Yeah.  And then they decided they didn't want to pay any of the guys anything.  Exactly.  And the guys didn't even really want much. 
[01:07:30]  They just wanted to feel like they were important.  Right.  We lost Patrice because of that.  They didn't want to pay him.  The amount of money for Patrice's show was nothing.  Yeah, yeah.  And Bill Burr was standing by.  He was ready to go.  Oh, yeah.  Miserable men on-  Actually, Bill Burr-  Yeah, 100 on Sundays.  Those guys were great guys, man.  They lost the-  And I know the money they were making.  It's nothingness.  Nothing.  And they lost it.  Why?  Because they just wanted a little money.  Surely they just gave up.  I think they just wanted something.  That's what happens here.  People just give up because you're like, what am I supposed to do? 
[01:08:00]  And then no one goes like, wow, no one thinks like, wow, that was a good show and we're losing it.  Maybe we ought to like, you know, see what we can do to keep it.  They're like, all right, well, whatever.  We'll get someone else.  We got a celebrity around.  Who's that?  Who's big right now?  Yeah.  You can't make your product.  You want people to go, oh, my God, I'm finding all this great new programming, this and that and this and that.  You don't want people to go, all right, well, I guess the product is becoming mediocre, so I don't care if I have the service or not.  Yeah.  You want this to be a service that people feel like they can't live without. 
[01:08:30]  Yep.  And the more talented people you have, the fucking, the more likely you are to have that effect.  Because people can have music anywhere.  Anywhere.  You can't just compete musically.  There are other ways to get all the music.  It's original talk content is the number.  That's what terrestrial radio fucked up.  Right.  The personalities, they emasculate it.  You need talk.  Original talk content is the only thing that you can sell that other people can't automatically have.  Yes.  We're heading that direction, but then.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You could just hire three shows and then fill the rest of the airtime with best stuff and save some of that cash. 
[01:09:00]  There you go.  Who's going to host that?  Oh, that's right.  You.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, right.  Sam.  Sure.  Look, if they would wake up, we'd have Patrice and Bill Burr in a second on this channel.  Yeah, that'd be nice.  Bill Burr had a show on this channel, but he didn't feel like doing it for free anymore.  He wanted just a little cash.  How about Kevin Smith?  He's still on, right?  Kevin's still on.  We got Rogan.  Of course.  So we're trying, but Patrice is made for this fucking thing, and they just don't want to,  I don't know, whatever. 
[01:09:30]  Enough, I guess, the bitching.  I know.  I know.  Hey, Sam.  Someone wants you to break down how much you make an hour.  How much?  Oh, boy.  Can you give us, like, figure that out during the break?  Yeah, I'll figure it out during the break.  How many hours a week do you work here?  It would have to be probably close to 60.  It would have to be close to 60. 
[01:10:00]  Somewhere in the 50s, I would think.  On an average week, on a rough week, it's definitely 60, if not more.  But on an average week, it's definitely in the 50s, on any week.  Write your number down for us.  Let me see.  I know you don't want to say it out loud.  I think I know about, but I have a rough idea.  Write your number down.  The annual number?  Yeah.  You don't have to show me.  You can just show.  I don't care if you guys know.  I don't know.  I don't know if you want.  250,000. 
[01:10:30]  That's not bad.  What?  I'm kidding.  Holy shit.  All right.  Nice, right?  Righteous bucks.  That's what I'm saying.  Holy shit.  Righteous bucks.  Righteous bucks.  Okay, hold on a second.  So.  Holy shit.  A little bit of math here.  Divide that by 52, and then divide it again.  I'm trying to open my calculator app.  Oh.  What happened?  Is it working?  Wait a minute.  So call it 55 hours.  So divide that by 52, and then divide it again by 55. 
[01:11:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  52?  For a week.  Jimmy's working it out.  Okay, that's divided by 55?  Yeah, 55 hours a week is fair.  I think that's beyond fair.  Just doing some math here.  Am I making minimum wage?  Oh, you're making minimum wage.  I don't know.  You're making, it looks like, almost $15 an hour. 
[01:11:30]  All right.  I mean, that's not.  That's okay for certain kind of jobs, but for on-air and drive time, it's not sufficient at all.  It's okay if you're doing, you know, there's a lot of jobs that pay less than $15 an hour.  Oh, yeah.  If you're doing.  Because now we're here for the people.  All right, man.  That's great.  No, no, no.  We understand.  But the amount of hours Sam is putting in as far as nighttime, daytime, and doing on-air stuff, it's not all behind-the-scenes stuff.  Plus, compared to what other people make doing similar tasks, you have to put that into effect. 
[01:12:00]  Well, you do.  You know that Howard at this point works less than 16 hours a week, right?  Oh, my God.  Okay, when you do the men, I mean, I know he's a legend, he's been around, blah, blah, blah, but he works maybe 12 some weeks.  He works.  Oh, would that be nice?  He works 12 to 16 hours a week when he's here.  Yeah, but I get like six, six days.  Six, six days.  But you're on your way up still, so, you know, you've got to put your time in.  We all understand that.  Yeah.  Let's go to Eric in Jersey. 
[01:12:30]  Eric.  Good morning.  You want to take us to task on the under-god thing?  Why?  It's a Monday.  Why do we want to deal with this?  Oh, just that the words under-god were just added in 1954 to the Pledge of Allegiance.  Oh, yeah, so that's just yesterday.  Well, for you it is.  That's 50, what are we looking at, seven years ago, I guess?  They were added as a result of Joe McCarthy and the McCarthy hearings looking for communists behind every tree. 
[01:13:00]  So they added under-god to flush out all the commies.  You know, I don't mind, honestly, the words under-god don't mean anything to me in the pledge.  I don't give a fuck if they take it out.  A part of me would love to see it taken out just to annoy religious people.  But I'm only irritated that NBC just kind of made that decision, and they've been kind of wrapped up in the last week saying what people should say and shouldn't say.  And it's like, come on, now all of a sudden you're going to make that decision, too?  Right.  It's the arbitrary nature of it that really bugs me, but it probably doesn't belong there. 
[01:13:30]  What, buddy?  What they did was a retro version.  Yeah, I know that, but we all know the agenda on why they were doing it.  Oh, yeah.  And the kids that weren't allowed to say the Pledge of Allegiance or how to leave the room, they were the Jehovah Witnesses.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I always try to figure out.  Oh, the Jehovah's Witnesses.  Right on, man.  I'm glad we flushed those kids out.  Yeah.  I knew I didn't want to play with them.  Thanks, Eric.  Okay.  Hey, by the way, Jimmy, I applaud your math skills today. 
[01:14:00]  Okay.  You did the math.  I did, yeah.  Everyone knows what Sam makes.  Yeah, I mean.  Oh, I didn't mean to.  Now they're doing it.  Well, I don't mind.  They nailed it, so that means you did your math correct.  Yeah.  I'm known as the end.  And they can't believe it, considering it's New York City, because we got all sorts of shit we deal with because it's New York City.  And 15 is rounded up, too.  Yeah, it is rounded up by a little bit.  Jeez.  The exact number.  Righteous bucks.  Righteous bucks.  How much do you have to pay a month just to park your car? 
[01:14:30]  $300?  Oh, God.  So this kid.  Let's gas.  Because this kid has to pay $300 a month just to get here.  Just to be here.  Yes.  So take that off your fucking salary.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  Over a tank a week.  Oh, my God.  One second now.  Yeah.  We're going to do a little bit more.  That is true.  Well, people all have to deal with the gas shit.  But the $300 a month, that's something that's very common for New Yorkers.  Yes.  If you're somewhere else, you're not paying that much money. 
[01:15:00]  And that's a deal, by the way, in New York.  We have to park like four or five blocks away to get that.  $300 a month is, how much is that a year?  $3,600?  Yeah, that knocks them down $3,600.  That's a big hunk off the top.  This is all pre-tax, of course.  Right.  That's a big hunk off the top.  We all have expenses, but like you said, in New York, that's a unique one.  Well, that's why people hear $15 an hour, that's pretty good, obviously.  But now you have to knock to $300 a month who pays just to park his car to get here. 
[01:15:30]  Commuting into Manhattan is very expensive.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah, train anything.  It's going to cost you money every day.  It's coming in every day.  The choo-choo train.  The choo-choo.  Westchester trains don't run that early anyway.  Yeah, because if they did, then you can maybe knock that down a little bit.  A little bit, a little bit.  Let's eat.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a good idea.  Going into break, the guys put together Bubble Cop. 
[01:16:00]  We play this on Friday.  Love Bubble Cop.  Let's play it again.  It's really good.  Mr. Maloonigans makes an appearance in this.  I couldn't stop saying that over the weekend, too.  Mr. Maloonigans.  I just kept going, where's Mr. Maloonigans?  I'm going to read this just to give you hope, Sam.  Great.  Because you got Howard, who's a legend.  Hope.  Oh, great.  And you got Sam on his way up.  Yeah.  And this is what you should be reaching for.  Right.  Somebody did the math on his contract. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, thank God for that.  How much did you make in Howard?  I think it was around.  Almost 15.  Almost, not quite 15.  A couple guys did the math on Howard, so it's got to be about.  And Howard may have actually been at this company about the same amount of time.  Right.  Like I said, he's been around forever.  Sure.  He deserves what he gets.  He's a legend.  Blah, blah, blah.  Okay.  Puts your salary in perspective.  He makes $120,000 an hour.  Oh, wow. 
[01:17:00]  That's so much more than me.  He makes $120,000.  Everyone has done the math on his.  That's actually $100,000.  That's coming in a lot, so it's got to be pretty close.  It's actually about $100,000 times the amount of money.  That's really nice, yeah.  Wow, it's huge.  It's like, Sam, let me really.  $100,000 of me.  Let me hammer this home for you.  Thank you.  Because I don't think you completely understand this.  I don't.  In one hour, you would have to work three years.  Wow. 
[01:17:30]  For every hour he's on the radio, you would have to work three years.  Three years to equal doing that hour.  16 shows.  Wow.  Okay.  That's a lot of time.  That's stunning.  It's coming in so many times that it's got to be about right.  So three years of you equals one hour of Howard.  Well, I mean, I hope it's a hell of an hour.  One hour is, yeah, two years pay for the average person. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Ouch.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  Wow.  Every hour.  Yeah.  Every hour is like, there's two years of you getting up, going to work, two years.  Or one year goes by, one year left to equal one hour.  That was 30 minutes.  That's amazing.  But that number could go up if he wins his lawsuit against the company.  Yeah.  Oh, I thought you meant for me.  This place is number.  Not for you.  Not for me.  This place is completely insane.  It's bizarro land for work.  If he won his lawsuit, I'd probably have to take a demotion in pay, which would just really skew the ratio. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, we're all screwed.  Look, you don't have the skills of Howard.  Okay.  You know, let's put it in perspective.  I can accept that.  So, you know.  Practice makes perfect.  How many years have you been here?  Five, six, something like that.  Called six.  Okay.  So, you've made in the last six years what Howard has made in two hours.  Wow.  So, your six years of work by eight o'clock this morning, Howard's going to match that. 
[01:19:00]  He's already finished.  Sam doesn't have the radio skills of Howard Hespin on WKRP in Cincinnati.  It was Johnny Fever.  Do you know, do you know, you have to work probably three months, let's say three, maybe  even six months, if Howard just decides to take a shit.  In the time he's taking a shit.  He's going to the bathroom.  You'd have to work like six months.  Right.  So, like, all the work I've done since January up until the end of this month. 
[01:19:30]  One dump.  It's some shit.  Just one dump.  That's also creatively a fair comparison.  Yes, exactly.  That's a fair.  Oh, there you go.  Perspective is a bitch, isn't it?  Yeah, I guess putting everything in mathematical terms.  But they're making progress on maybe getting a little more money.  A little more cake.  That's how they say it.  Upstairs.  We're trying to get you a little more money.  It's okay.  Good.  Upstairs.  Sam never shows the uglier, angrier side of him.  He should a little bit more.  It's in there.  Of course, you little viper. 
[01:20:00]  You're bothered by it.  He should be.  He's a poster child for what's happening around here.  We're just focusing on him, but there's a lot of guys just on our own staff that are  in the same boat.  Not Eric, but everyone else.  Yeah, Eric's overpaid.  Wait, Iraq's shaking.  He just got mad.  Iraq's kind of overpaid.  Overpaid, overfed.  Does he make more money than you?  Eric?  Yeah.  I mean, you take that figure and you double it.  No.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not talking about weight. 
[01:20:30]  Oh.  We're not tripling.  No.  Eric got in early when the getting was good.  Oh, when the getting was good, right?  Eric got in when the getting was good.  Yeah.  It's not his fault.  He just got in when the...  He got grandfathered in?  Timing.  Okay.  Timing was a bitch for a lot of money.  He has been here since the beginning.  Timing was good when he stole all your lottery money from all you guys.  Technically, I wasn't on the staff when he stole all that lotto money, but I speak  up for...  I'm like the union head first.  I hear you.  Did he really steal that lotto money?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I did not.  Yes, he did. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, wow.  Everyone was having a pool, right?  No.  It had nothing to do with that.  It was a staff newspaper we sent to the studio.  I thought we were going to pass this, Father.  He sent in the team.  We're never going to be past this.  Now we're going to bring in the new listeners.  Wait, if it was a staff newspaper, how...  It wasn't a staff newspaper because those little scratch-off things come on the Sunday  papers.  Yeah, but they don't come to...  We didn't get weekend papers at the office.  Who brought the paper in?  Come on, Mark.  Fuck.  And we did.  I had it because I've been playing that for weeks.  You didn't bring it.  I had it in my bag.  I've never seen Eric bring a newspaper into the studio in my entire life. 
[01:21:30]  No, the scratch card, not the paper.  And why would he bring in Sunday's newspaper on a Monday morning?  Right.  Just don't listen to me.  My mic's not on.  I'm listening.  Oh!  But I am...  I'm actually asking.  I know you are, but...  Liar!  Sorry.  All right, it makes sense.  So you had the scratch ticket thing.  Yeah.  I've been playing that game for weeks.  So when...  Where did the story come from that it was not your ticket?  Because they all got pissed off, and I...  Why are you yelling? 
[01:22:00]  I remember...  I'm disgusting.  I do remember a paper, though.  I don't remember just the ticket.  I remember that paper being here.  It was there.  It was from Sunday's paper.  They came from the Sunday's paper.  That's where you got the scratch off from.  Right.  And then each day, you would go into the numbers of the newspaper and scratch off on your card.  So where did the newspaper come from?  Studio.  The Sunday paper came from my place.  You brought that paper in.  No, I didn't bring the paper in.  You brought in the scratch card.  Could you get the scratch card Monday's paper? 
[01:22:30]  No.  It came on Sunday's paper, and then through the week, you had to find the numbers in the newspaper.  Okay, so...  So each day, you were scratching something.  So the Sunday paper, you have a scratch card...  That's your ass.  ...with a week's worth of numbers on it.  Correct.  And you scratched Monday, and then Tuesday, and then Wednesday as...  No.  I had come in, and I was told that there was this story that all these people won $100,000  because of an error.  Because of a miscar.  I checked my card, and I went, oh, I want it too.  But then they had a separate pool for all these people, because some of them formed some 
[01:23:00]  group that they were going to sue the Daily News.  The others, you could mail it in with this waiver, and they would put into a special  drawing that they would pick a winner out of...  Five winners out of that.  And that's where I won.  Did anybody sue the Daily News?  Did they win?  They did not win.  It didn't even go to court.  Why?  They threw it out, saying it was frivolous.  Because the rules do state that if there's a misprint or anything, they're not held responsible.  Wow.  See, okay.  Yeah, I didn't sign the thing for the lawsuit.  I sent it in for the secondary drawing.  I wonder how many people did. 
[01:23:30]  You won out of how many people, I wonder.  I don't think they said how many were actually in the pool.  They just said the five winners.  You were one of them.  I was one of them.  This story does not sound like the original story.  He made it up.  There seemed to be a viable problem that you guys had with this whole thing, and the fact  that E-Rock was the one that kind of grabbed everything off.  He figured enough times past, he could make up some stuff.  Revisionist history?  Is that what happened, Eric?  Revisionist history?  No, that's not what happened at all.  Yeah, he made up a little story in his head and figured after a couple years, I'll start 
[01:24:00]  using this.  And then the time goes by, and you blurt it out.  Exactly.  That's what happened.  Exactly.  What is it going to take for the whole staff to get past this with E-Rock?  Oh, please.  Because it's been years now.  Are we up to four or five years at this point?  It must be five years.  Five years ago.  I mean, this was early XM days, pre-K-Rock.  How many of that hundred Gs you still got?  This was before the studio built out.  Almost all of it was invested.  It was?  In boats in Florida.  Pretty cool, huh?  What did you invest in? 
[01:24:30]  Property.  Besides not gym equipment.  It's a property?  How did you do on it?  A suite fucking piece of property somewhere.  Really?  What, did you get a little condo for yourself?  Yeah, I bought a condo down in Florida.  Did you?  Yeah.  That's cool.  And then the market crashed, so it's worth a quarter of what he paid for.  They bought it from Al Pacino.  Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross leads.  Yeah, you said it's doing well and makes a great point.  Most condos in Florida are a bust.  Especially in Florida.  Housing market is terrible right now.  Yeah.  Especially in Florida.  It's right near the water.  Especially in Florida. 
[01:25:00]  You're trying to tell me it went up or do you have people running here?  It's across the street from the ocean, so it's still doing well.  The only solace that any of us have in this whole lotto situation is we found out that  Eric spent a whole bunch of his salary money in the beginning buying XM stock.  Oh.  And that's when it was way up.  That wasn't from the lotto winning thing.  No, no, no.  I know, I know.  But what was the...  Just in a matter of...  $42, right? 
[01:25:30]  Yep.  And how many shares did you buy?  I did that employee purchase program when we started there.  A purchase program?  Which was what?  A purchase program.  Which is...  You got a discount on purchasing based on whatever the last quarter price was.  So instead of $42, they charged you a dollar?  That would be...  Yeah.  When I started buying, it was at $42.  Oh, God.  It'll be back there in no time.  It was two shares a week.  Nagle was investing in a little Nagle.  I'm investing in myself.  Yes.  Two shares a week you would buy? 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  How many total shares of Sirius did you end up getting?  $84 every week down the drain.  Were you allowed to buy more than two shares a week?  Yeah, you could buy up to a certain set amount.  But I couldn't afford that set amount.  So I was just doing two shares a week.  So how many shares did you buy?  Let's see.  When did they discontinue that program?  The whole program?  Yeah, the company got rid of it. 
[01:26:30]  Uh, 2007.  So you were at least for like...  They eliminated that program.  Two and a half years, maybe?  Since 2004.  Oh, my God.  Four, five, six, seven.  Four years.  Or, no, three years.  Say three years.  Say three years.  And what?  150 weeks.  150 weeks.  320 shares or something?  Yeah.  All right, about 320 shares.  At $42 a share?  At $42.  Oh, my God.  What are we looking at?  Let's look at cost.  It dropped dramatically.  We got, yeah, his average.  Average in the cost?  Yeah, we got to figure that shit out. 
[01:27:00]  But we all know what it is now.  Safe to say he lost his shirt.  Just take it.  And that's a big shirt to lose.  He now has about $630 of stock.  Yeah.  Ah, a little nest egg.  $630 of stock that he probably paid thousands for.  Just in case that little real estate deal falls.  That's right.  I got my stock.  Nagel's diversified.  We can laugh at E-Rock all we want, but we're the kings of fucking losing money in the stock market.  Oh, please.  Sit a deal. 
[01:27:30]  I hear you.  Yeah.  All right, sandwich time.  Yeah.  Uh, E-Rock, you're going to play the Bobo Cop.  Yeah.  Bobo Cop.  What are we going to do after the break?  Bobo Cop.  Eric, I'm sorry for taking out my frustrations on you.  Go fuck yourself, Sam.  Oh.  Oh, we got This Day in ONA History.  We're going to do that.  Oh, ONA History.  I like that.  Tracy Morgan.  I like that segment.  I want to see where everyone's at with Tracy Morgan.  Yeah, Tracy.  And we lost Clarence Clemens.  Where'd he go?  Maybe we'll get Roland to talk about the big man today. 
[01:28:00]  Tracy.  Maybe his memories or something.  Maybe we'll get some saxophone playing as Roland.  That could be nice.  Gives his memories as a big man.  Maybe Bob Eatman can come in and play the French horn.  Oh, come on.  You can hit him with a fucking...  Who's he?  With a mallet.  I like to drive his French horn through the back of his head with a mallet.  That would be great.  How great would it be to put on a boxing glove and punch his French horn into his throat?  I'd hear his teeth come with it. 
[01:28:30]  He'd be so mad.  Clunk.  Right through his dumb neck.  I've almost forgotten about him.  I haven't talked to him in a while.  Yeah.  I wonder if he's doing well.  I think he's in Boston doing something.  Is he doing well?  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Good for him.  He's all right, you know.  Yeah.  What we have here is the best of both worlds. 
[01:29:00]  The fastest reflexes modern technology has to offer, onboard memory, and 30 years of human experience and interaction.  BoboCop, what are your prime directives?  To serve the public trust, protect the innocent, uphold the law, and to jerk off in a toilet, all right?  Part man, part robot, complete imbecile.  Alive or dead, dead or alive, you're...  What am I supposed to say?  Hey, fuck you, you metallic mongoloid. 
[01:29:30]  Eat a bowl of dick.  Will he be able to recall his past memories?  Don't you remember?  Bobo, it's you.  What's me?  You, Bobo.  It's you.  Who is?  Holy fuck, Bobo.  You.  It's you.  Bobo, it's you.  I think I'm in a weak signal area.  Can I get it?  Please respond.  We have a 63 in progress.  All right, let's go, Mr. Maloon again.  BoboCop, who is he?  What is he? 
[01:30:00]  I suck.  The dumbest, most annoying person on the planet is now a law-enforcing cyborg.  BoboCop, BoboCop, any special message for the kids at home?  Believe me, you're right.  You gotta wear a condom when you go to sleep, because you don't want to jizz in your pants when you're...  BoboCop?  Sorry, sorry.  I mean, I mean, stay out of trouble.  BoboCop. 
[01:30:30]  Sirius XM.  The Virus.  Gather round, kids, for a tale of childhood trauma.  It's a molestation memory with our friend, Jim Florentine.  My dad used to take us to wrestling matches at Madison Square Garden, and we met this guy out front who would sell wrestling pictures.  Fat guy, 300 pounds, a bad mustache, you know, and we became friends with him somehow.  He's like, oh, give me your address.  So he started sending us pictures of all the kids in the neighborhood.  Then he would call me on the phone and tell me about the match the night before.  And my voice was about this, it was this deep at 14, and he's on the other end, and I'm asking all these questions, and he's fucking breathing heavy. 
[01:31:00]  I had no idea.  But then he wound up staying over at my house.  He knew all the kids in the neighborhood, because we all go to the matches.  He convinced my dad, he's like, oh, you know, I want to hang with the kids on a Saturday afternoon.  He took the bus from New York, the middle of Jersey.  And my parents are a little weird about it.  Like, I don't know, but like, all right, you know, they talk to the other parents and neighbor.  You think this is all right?  You know, he's a 40-year-old guy hanging around 14-year-olds. 
[01:31:30]  They put him in the guest room the night before.  I wake up in the morning.  I'm sleeping.  He has his hand on my pants.  He snuck down there, and I fucking jump.  I go, what are you doing?  He has my cock.  He goes, I'm showing you a magic trick.  I'm like, a magic trick?  I just said, I ran to the door to go tell my brothers, my older brothers, and he blocked the door.  He goes, he went right to the photo album.  He goes, look, I got 50 pictures, and I'll give you 35 of them if you don't say anything.  But my brothers were like, my brothers afterwards go, you've got to tell mom and dad about this.  I go, no, because they were going to make me get their pictures back. 
[01:32:00]  I'm like, fuck that.  I earned them.  Fucking kissed him on the cheek.  I sat on his lap.  He grabbed my cock.  I should have got that and this camera.  This has been a Molestation Moment with our friend, Jim Florentine.  Now you know why he is the way he is.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:32:30]  Oh boy, the hallways are abuzz here at Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  A buzz.  A buzz, yes.  Is it abuzz, you think?  Oh yeah.  Or is there a little...  Scuttlebutt.  A scuttlebutt?  I think there's been some scuttlebutt in the hallways about things.  And of course, it has something to do with Troy.  Troy always in the middle of his shit.  He really is.  Always there.  He's just always there, Troy.  That's pretty cool.  Troy goes...  What is that shirt?  Like a tube?  Yeah, it's a vacuum tube for... 
[01:33:00]  A vacuum tube.  That's pretty cool.  From the amplifier.  That is cool.  If you were a hipster.  Yeah, exactly.  He is kind of a hipster.  Hipster.  It's a band t-shirt.  And they're not a hipster.  Wow.  I'm hipper than you is what you're trying to tell everybody.  But see, this is a band t-shirt and they're not a hipster.  Where's your ironic Mr. T-shirt?  A band no one heard of.  That's what hipsters do.  This band just got off tour with the Deftones. 
[01:33:30]  I may have heard of a little band called the Deftones.  Little band called the Deftones.  Troy goes, hey man, that was a great hour of radio.  And I go, yeah, but was it a great hour for the listeners?  Because that's what you got to ask yourself every time, Troy.  And Troy actually said what?  I said, who doesn't deal with that bullshit at their work?  You know what I mean?  Where they're underpaid, they're underappreciated, nobody gives a fuck about them.  They're just these replaceable parts.  It's like, oh, okay, we'll hire some other jerk off to do your job and pay a half price anyway.  That's it.  And the people that make all those decisions are just rolling in the dough that's meant for us. 
[01:34:00]  Well, that's why they're there.  Because they know how to make those decisions and they're smart with it.  They know how to save the company money.  You're making good money, aren't you?  Less than him.  Oh, my God.  I didn't think that was possible.  They fucked him good.  Is that what Sam just said?  They fucked him good.  What?  Yeah.  Can you write your number down?  No, I don't even want to.  I'm so embarrassed.  Wow.  You get to the point where you just... 
[01:34:30]  Sam said, can I?  Is it Sam's number backwards?  No.  Jesus.  How much less than Sam would you say?  More than five less than Sam?  No, no.  I don't even want to talk about it.  I mean, it's just you have a roundabout idea.  But I'll get Steve in here then.  Let's get Steve Cerniello in.  I was just talking to Steve Cerniello.  He does a great job on Raw Dog.  Right.  He was the producer for the show I was doing.  He heard it.  Yeah, but we're starting with Troy and then we'll move on to the next one.  Put him on deck.  The hallways are abuzz and why is that Troy? 
[01:35:00]  Troy Kwan.  Well, I guess Alex Bennett had talked shit about Benji crashing the wiener thing last week.  And then Howard finally was here today because he's been off for the past couple of days.  He was finally here today.  Oh, boy, man.  That's not toeing the country line.  It's got to be rah, rah, rah.  He was finally here.  Well, it feels like old news now.  You know what I mean?  Oh, my God.  Right?  I mean...  Well, you shut the fuck up. 
[01:35:30]  Am I wrong in saying that?  I don't know.  I mean, you guys played the audio last Friday.  You know, it's like old shit.  And then there was the weekend.  Well, I mean, we applauded what Benji did.  Yeah.  We thought it was funny.  I told him so the first round he did.  I haven't seen him since, but I'll say it again.  That shit is hilarious.  And Alex Bennett, now, Alex Bennett was a big-time jock in San Francisco.  Made a name for himself, certainly.  And he did some crazy shit before he became an old fucking miserable man. 
[01:36:00]  I don't know too much.  I just know that he shits every day and he always brings the newspaper in.  He fucking, to this day, he gives us a look every time he walks by the studio.  We've moved past him.  What?  And he has to watch the dance.  What?  What?  What did he say?  I'm sorry.  So wait, what?  He wants to be fired today.  This is awesome.  What did he say on the air about the Benji thing?  I don't know.  I'm listening to your guy's show.  I don't listen to Howard right now.  So this is just a word.  Here's what we have so far, though. 
[01:36:30]  That Howard...  Alex was trashing the Benji thing.  Trashing the Benji thing.  And reports are that Howard actually left his studio.  Yes.  Went into Alex's studio.  Yep.  And confronted him live on the air.  Yes.  I just saw the tweets from the Stern show.  Did he punch him with a telephone?  Let's get the tweets.  Go to the Stern show.  Here's my guess.  It's only a guess because I've never listened to Alex Bennett on the air, ever. 
[01:37:00]  I'm going to guess that he trashed Benji because he interrupted the press conference of somebody whose ideology Alex agrees with.  And I'm going to venture a guess that if that had been Sarah Palin speaking, he never would have a problem with that.  No, of course not.  Now, again, I've never listened to his show.  I don't know how consistent he is.  But he is one of these liberal friggin' jackasses.  I just find most guys like that are fucking, they have this phony, truth-to-power bullshit. 
[01:37:30]  Reprehensible.  Hey, right on.  Good for Howard.  Alex is a douche.  That was 37 minutes ago.  Let's see.  After blasting radio host Alex Bennett for his negative reaction to Benji, Howard plans on going down the hall to his studio after this break.  But Howard's confronting Alex Bennett on Alex's show live right now on, and then they got the channels.  And that was like 21 minutes ago, so I guess he finished. 
[01:38:00]  And that was that.  We need first-hand information.  Where's Sterniolo?  Sterniolo heard it.  Ooh, Sterniolo.  My Italian name, Robert.  Where's the Sterniolo?  Ola.  Yeah.  He's running down.  Running down the low.  That's what that guy's name is?  The long of a way.  Yeah.  He's very active on Raw Dog.  Very cool.  Yeah.  And he has a new show starting today, I think. 
[01:38:30]  Hey, Steve.  Hey.  Steve.  Wait, you were the one that was on Friday with Sam yelling and screaming, or Thursday?  Yeah, I was on E-Rock on Thursday.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, that was some great radio.  Oh, little E-Rock.  No, it was great radio.  Steve came in, and he fucking wasn't going to take shit from nobody.  He smashed E-Rock pretty good.  He pretty much took over your show, Sam.  I know, it was great.  Steve took over your show, I think that was Thursday, right?  He did a great job.  But at the end of the day, Sam doesn't mind when other people come on and sound good,  because at the end of the day, the name on the show is Opie and Anthony. 
[01:39:00]  That's right.  So you made us look good, Sam.  Thank you.  And we weren't even close to this building.  Yes.  Wait, did you just write like Carson?  Oh, you're like Carson?  The ribs.  Carson would let other people shine, is what Sam was saying.  Just like Carson.  Yeah, you look like him, too.  Thank you.  Exactly.  So what happened, Steve?  So I was listening to Howard this morning.  Why not listen to us?  Yeah.  And you guys at the same time.  Can't you listen to both of us?  I listened to Sam's rap about his pay and everything.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, I was hearing you guys.  I was hearing you guys. 
[01:39:30]  One in each year.  Yeah, good, good.  I was going in between, and Howard was playing the Benji audio, which you guys actually commented  on before Howard did, which is pretty interesting.  I was off.  We were just trying to help him out.  Believe me.  I wish we couldn't have commented on it, too, because we were off.  Unfortunately, his agent won't handle this show.  Yeah.  So Howard played the audio, and then he played the usual rundown of the news stories that  commented, and one of them happened to be Alex Bennett.  And, oh boy, was Alex Bennett not pleased with the disgrace and the mockery that Benji 
[01:40:00]  Bronk made of the Anthony Wiener press conference.  Isn't the conference itself a mockery and a disgrace?  I thought so.  Yeah.  So if you throw anything in there, it's not going to make it any worse.  Yeah.  I mean, I thought that was the joke, that here's Benji yelling about Wieners at Anthony  Wiener while he resigns, and the whole thing is, this thing's been a joke the whole time.  What's another joke?  It's a joke the whole time.  The whole thing is about this guy's dick. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  My dick.  But my point, too, is Alex Bennett understands this type of radio.  That's why it's very confusing.  It's not like some fucking stiff political guy doing a little dumb little talk show somewhere.  It's Alex Bennett.  He did, quote, crazy shit in his career.  Well, he, Howard's, I mean, he was just, you know.  What problem did Alex have with it?  We haven't even asked you.  His problem was that this guy has been embarrassed enough, which Alex fails to bring up.  His own doing, he was embarrassed enough. 
[01:41:00]  It wasn't like someone else embarrassed him.  He embarrassed himself.  Let me ask you your opinion, because I've never listened to Alex Bennett.  Your opinion.  Do you know anything about Alex if you listen to his show?  No.  I know his co-host, Christina, who you guys have had on, who was the Bobo's love.  I'm wondering if he would have the same anger if that had been a conservative guy stepping  down or Republican.  I mean, I thought the same thing, but I mean, I don't really listen to Alex Bennett, so I  don't want to judge him that way.  I think that, I mean, what he said, that's the most preposterous thing, that he should  have been able to leave with some dignity.  In all reality, he erased every bit of dignity he had on his own. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, you can't leave that press conference with dignity.  Yeah.  Just ain't gonna happen.  So, how was the confrontation?  The confrontation was kind of a letdown, actually, because I have to say, Howard, as a Howard  fan, Howard gets angry, and then when confronting, it's not so much he backs down as much as when  that person's nice to him, he's gonna be nice back.  So, Alex, all of a sudden, kind of changed his tune.  He wasn't so angry anymore about the disgrace and the mockery, so they kind of had a normal 
[01:42:00]  type of conversation.  It wasn't anything too exciting when they were around each other.  What did Alex say about it?  Alex said that, Howard said, you know, his usual Howard stuff, and Alex said, you know,  you are right, you help bring listeners, and you know, I have fans because you came over,  so he kind of gave Howard some props.  He has fans.  Go to that Twitter page for a second.  Who's Twitter page is this?  Alex Bennett.  He has 361 followers.  He must not have Twittered in eight months. 
[01:42:30]  No, June 18th.  Let me see.  What is he dressed as?  I don't know what that whole thing, his profile pic is, a scream.  It is a scream.  Oot.  That's hundreds of followers, though.  We're starving and homeless, and they're out playing golf.  We're doing radio.  What do you mean, we're?  Wiener has been out of the Congress for over 24 hours. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, he's a left.  So what has our government done now that they can, quote, get back to business?  When did liberals become, sorry, Obi, when did liberals become so humorless?  Well, read June 6th, Jimmy.  That says it all for you.  Anthony Wiener.  Anthony Wiener shouldn't resign.  He is the biggest.  Fighters.  He's the biggest fighters for the left.  He's a good congressman for New York and shouldn't resign.  Hey, you know what?  I got no problem with that opinion.  I almost agree with it.  I think Wiener just kind of made his own case worse by being such a fucking comfortable liar. 
[01:43:30]  I think the first lie we get, but after all, he should have owned up a little bit faster.  But I don't even disagree with that.  Wiener into rehab.  Oh, yes.  Somebody acts human, and it's off for behavior modification.  Acting human?  You mean a politician blatantly out in the open lying?  Is that what you want, Alex, just because you believe in the same bullshit that he did,  the same liberal trash?  Is that you want your politicians overtly lying to you? 
[01:44:00]  I know they're all full of shit.  They're all a bunch of lying fucks, but at least keep it under wraps, could you?  By the way, is he out of rehab?  The second it comes out, you're done.  Is he out of rehab or is he in rehab still?  I don't know if he was ever in rehab.  I thought he went into rehab.  How did he resign?  What happened?  He resigned.  What happened in rehab?  Then he's seen him.  He was there, he's out three days later.  He's out three days later.  Then you're seeing him, I guess he was with his wife at some point, shopping.  And like a King Cullen.  Whistling a happy tune. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, he was singing along to the songs in the supermarket.  Oh, maybe it's just buying rehab supplies.  Isn't that how it goes?  Yeah, no.  That's what Anthony Wiener said.  No, no, no.  She just got booed on stage again.  I'm so happy that bitch is going down a toilet.  Amy Winehouse and her fucking aunt body.  She fucked up.  They're saying it's the worst concert ever.  Where?  In Serbia, I think.  Serbia?  Where they've had ethnic cleansing.  Yeah.  You know how bad you have to be for people who have dealt with ethnic cleansing to boo? 
[01:45:00]  Yes.  Where is that?  Amy Winehouse got booed off the stage.  I fucking hate performers.  Worst concert ever, they're saying, for that area.  And she had to cancel her European tour.  Thank you, Roland.  I hate performers that treat their fucking fans so badly and put such a little effort.  But it's these, stop going to see these fucking...  All right, we're going to talk about this, man.  The show?  Yeah.  Exactly.  I hate performers.  Oh, wait.  That's us.  Stop fucking going to see these people, you dumb fans.  More importantly, Steve, what was your problem with E-Rock?  We're going to be on Thursday.  Let's...  E-Rock's taking a beating today.  He just...  Oh, yeah. 
[01:45:30]  He just leered at everyone in the hall after that first hour.  He's an angry feller.  He is an angry feller, right?  Yeah.  I mean, I think he just gets his balls busted all day, even when he's not with you guys.  I think in the offices, and I think he just gets his balls busted a lot.  In life.  Just in life.  I just...  I think he's just a defeated guy.  E-Rock, are you a defeated guy?  E-Rock, are you a defeated guy?  Sterniolo says you're a defeated guy.  I think you're defeated.  I think.  No.  Okay.  No.  And he says you get your balls busted in real life and on the radio.  At least they're talking about me. 
[01:46:00]  Who talks about him?  No!  Oh!  Hey, look.  I don't even want to get involved in this.  It's fun getting called a fat waste of nothing all day.  I wish everyone would call me that live on the radio all the time.  You're right.  That's great.  It's really good press.  It's great.  E-Rock, I think it's back to you.  I think the ball's in your court.  Ouch.  Oh, look.  He works on a show that doesn't acknowledge that he works on that show. 
[01:46:30]  Funny in the morning.  I do just fine for myself, Eric.  I'm very comfortable with my position here at SiriusXX.  As am I.  But you have a problem with my position.  No.  I have a problem that you can't do 26 push-ups and make $250 because it's obvious that you  don't need the money if you can't do 26 push-ups.  Ouch.  It's insane.  Unbelievable.  I saw people that are huge ONA fans and they're like, you're right.  Like, that was disturbing.  All our fans are huge.  It was disturbing.  They couldn't do 26 push-ups either.  No, no.  But it was just weird because I could have used $250 in cash, which was a very nice offer, 
[01:47:00]  and Sam did his part.  You've got to be making good money around here.  Doc, great money.  Bang it out.  Yeah.  Living life.  Perfect.  This is why we brought up the same thing.  Doing well.  They're lining up outside the studio door.  They all want a shot now to bitch a little bit.  I just think that Iraq could have done better.  And 26 push-ups.  He's not even...  How many did he do?  14?  14.  He tapped.  He tapped.  How many were, like, actual good push-ups?  Well, he pretended...  Apparently none of them. 
[01:47:30]  He pretended he was mad at the rules when the fact was he couldn't do any more push-ups  than 14.  He's just mad at life.  Yeah.  Just angry.  Yeah, he should be.  I'll put $100 down right now if fucking Iraq could do 20 push-ups.  Can I get the same bet?  Wow.  20 fucking push-ups.  I'll give you $100 right now on the spot.  Chest to the floor push-ups.  Do it.  Fine.  He wasn't going to do it.  He doesn't need the $100.  He wasn't going to do it.  He wasn't going to do it.  No, Troy had to push him.  Because he doesn't need it.  He doesn't need it.  I didn't know Troy was that strong. 
[01:48:00]  Pretty cool, huh?  Where's Mars, though?  They've got to be official push-ups.  Where's that rolling count?  How does Mars know official push-ups with his little barrel body?  For a martial artist, Mars is in an awful shape.  He's got a belly.  He fucking does.  Mars is an MMA guy.  He's fucking built like George the Animal Steel.  I was going to say, he's starting to look like John Wayne at the end of his fucking career.  Yeah, the old school fucking tough guy body.  Look at Mars.  He's like, what are you doing? 
[01:48:30]  Mars has a shit gut.  Shit gut on Mars.  Because you brag about MMA and stuff.  Holy shit.  I don't brag, but I could hold my own.  And I also could hold my own in push-ups.  How many could you do?  How many can you do?  I could probably do 60 without something.  Weiner held with that.  Mars is an animal when it comes to push-ups.  He takes five-minute breaks, but if he's allowed breaks, he could do 500 push-ups.  Literally.  Wait, you're saying he's not allowed breaks and he's taking a lot of breaks? 
[01:49:00]  No.  What happened there?  I got confused.  I knew I could do 500 push-ups if we're allowed breaks.  Five-minute breaks.  Yeah, right?  You could do 500 push-ups with five-minute breaks in between sets?  Sure.  Just give me a month.  No, five-minute breaks.  Yeah, but how many at a time?  That's what he said.  I do 30 at a time.  Oh, 30 at a time.  That was one of the worst.  How many push-ups do you do a day instead of working?  Yeah, he sits there in the engineering booth doing push-ups.  You do 300 push-ups a day instead of working? 
[01:49:30]  He doesn't have a lot of work.  Ten of a little.  Oh, he's solid.  He gets his strong arms.  Mars is built like a brick shithouse.  Yeah.  Is that it?  It's like a bulldog.  Or like a pit bull.  Yeah.  Mars is like a pit bull.  Mars has like Fedor fat on him, like just a little bit wrapped around with five-minute  tall.  Good padding, right?  Yeah.  It's good padding.  Around a lot of muscle.  Hey, that's a lot of push-ups.  300 a day is a good amount.  But Herschel Walker, many, many years ago, I heard this.  2,000 sit-ups and 2,000 push-ups a day.  And I heard that 20 years ago.  That's crazy.  But that's the type why he's in that shape.  That's crazy. 
[01:50:00]  And he's the force to be reckoned with in the Strikeforce.  Yeah, he is.  Sexy man still comfy in his seat over there.  He's not coming in?  He's not getting up.  Come on, sex man.  Let's go.  Sex man.  What?  I don't need it.  I'm good.  What a fucking asshole.  Sex man is 100 bucks.  See, this is why people get mad at you, though, Iraq.  Why don't you shut people up?  Because I do enough shit around here.  I don't need to do more physical fitness on the radio.  You know how people look at it, though?  They look at it like everyone's starving. 
[01:50:30]  You have a giant plate of food in front of you.  And it's only for you.  And you're like, I don't eat that.  No, thanks.  And that's not even an analogy.  That's very literal.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, he would eat it, then.  I like Eric a lot.  He's very nice to me.  He's helped out with some stuff.  I'm a big fan of it.  But just looking into his eyes, whenever you say, like, hello, or you talk to him, he's  like, oh, how's this person going to insult me or break me down now?  I think you're right.  He's got that in his eyes.  Like, I feel bad sometimes.  Iraq comes in every morning, and he's like, hey, good morning. 
[01:51:00]  I'm like, hey, good morning, Iraq, or Mr. Rock, or I'll say something.  But the way he's looking is just like, oh, another day of abuse.  Will I dodge a bullet today?  He should be coming in here, busting out 20 push-ups, and then being like, fuck all  of you for doubting me.  Give me my fucking Benjamin, bitch.  That is true, bitch.  20 push-ups for $100.  Who wouldn't do that?  But he just walks into the punchlines because he blows it off.  Fuck, that's hot.  He once got a salad for lunch and got insulted.  Like, how do you win when you get a salad and someone's going to insult you? 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  I mean, there's a lot of dressing on the salad.  There it is.  And a lot of croutons.  I mean, croutons.  Croutons have a lot of fucking bacon bits, for sure.  When you have a salad.  Is it a healthy salad?  If a salad smells up the entire room, it's a healthy salad.  See what I mean?  Like, that sucks.  Like, you might as well get McDonald's if you're going to get insulted.  That's right.  Yeah, but, yeah.  He's not doing the push-ups, though.  He's coming in.  He could be like, fuck all of you.  That's right.  But he's not doing it. 
[01:52:00]  Iraq, could you?  I know, I know.  But can you tell us what your salad consists of?  I need to know now.  Please.  Because they're making wild accusations.  Yeah.  The same thing every time.  Be honest.  I am.  Romaine lettuce.  That's good.  So far, so good.  Tomato.  Cucumber.  Good.  Carrot.  Good.  The, uh, I believe it's the, uh, I believe it's cheddar.  The yellow cheese.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Cheese.  You can have fucking cheese with your food.  You don't have to eat like shit like you guys to say, oh, I'm being healthy. 
[01:52:30]  Because I'm eating fucking cardboard every day.  I said, I said just a little bit.  A little bit.  No, no.  It's not a little bit.  Oh, you're having cheese.  That leads to this, and leads to this, and leads to this, and leads to this.  And then the whole fucking thing is just so bad for you.  No, see, I know, I know what he's doing now.  Because he doesn't want to say what else is on the salad.  No, I'll tell you what else is on the salad.  All right.  The cheese is starting to go into the area of, we're starting to head toward bad.  Yeah, I'm not saying it's bad.  It started out with the romaine lettuce. 
[01:53:00]  I'm like, all right, all right.  It's like, all right, here comes the cheese.  It started with lettuce, which they say is minus calories.  Right.  It takes more energy to eat lettuce.  To chew it.  So he went from that.  Now we're in the cheese category, where the calories have officially begun.  The salad has to taste good.  All right.  Salad's got to taste good.  He's right.  I'll start over in case you missed it.  Romaine lettuce.  No, we got it.  Cucumber.  Tomato.  Cucumber.  A little carrot action.  The yellow cheese, grilled chicken, green olives, and I get it chopped with light Italian 
[01:53:30]  dressing.  It's the same thing every time.  Where's the honey mustard?  I never eat honey mustard.  Sam, how much cheese?  Sam set us up, you motherfucker.  Whatever they scoop it on.  He's lying to you.  It's not like that.  Sam's saying you're lying.  I never eat honey mustard.  Well, then how does that salad make a whole room smell like unhealthy salad?  The what?  That's my salad.  Oh, that's Roland's salad.  Oh, God.  Do you want to hear Roland's salad?  Kit Kat bars, some pork rinds, pizza from the pizza party, sliced pizza. 
[01:54:00]  Hey, words hurt.  Hey, words hurt.  Anyways, girlfriends.  What?  What?  I just had my lettuce, pasta, bacon bits, croutons.  Bacon bits.  I gave it three cheeses, feta, blue, yellow, and some other stuff, tangerines.  Tangerines?  Yeah, I discovered that recently, too. 
[01:54:30]  Fucking tangerines in a salad.  I mix citrus with this salad.  It fucking works.  Because that Mexican guy goes, what else, what else?  And then by the time I'm done, it's a $22 salad.  He gets me every fucking time, that asshole.  What else, boss?  What else, boss?  Because it's a whole thing of ingredients, and every one you pick is like a dollar right  off the salad.  Yeah, it's like I just keep on doing it until he stops, and I go, fuck.  It's fucking behind-the-counter bottles of Excedrin thrown in there.  He's just fucking throwing every...  I didn't roll in.  I had barbecue chicken on top.  Barbecue chicken. 
[01:55:00]  Because that barbecue sauce, mm-mm, is that good, right?  It's low-calorie because it's very little.  Low-cal.  Yeah, what about the three cheeses?  Club Soda Candy.  Cheese equals fat.  Well, that's true.  And deliciousness.  I watched that cheese.  Hey, Roland, while we have you on mic, Clarence Clemens there, you want to talk over the saxophone,  your thoughts about the big man?  No, just sad that he passed away because...  I thought he was doing better.  So did Bruce.  Everybody did.  The media sucks because he has a stroke, and then...  A bunch of statements came out that he's doing really well. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  And then he's dead a few days later.  Don't those horn players look like they're going to pop a vein every time they're playing?  Yeah, no shit.  Like, you just look at the side of Clarence's head.  They were showing some fucking footage of an old gig, and he's blowing on a saxophone.  You're like, that vein looks like an aorta coming out of the side of his head.  I bet you it can't be good when you get older to be blowing into a horn like that.  During the tour, he sat down in the special chair.  He never really got up that much.  Really?  Oh, boy.  So they kind of knew that he was sick. 
[01:56:00]  To sit him in a chair to play the saxophone?  Yeah, he did during Jungle Land, Prove It All Night, and started a song.  What was wrong with him?  They didn't say, but they didn't say what his other elements were.  They just say he was sick.  What his other elements were?  Yeah, he had both knees replaced, both hips replaced, and other stuff.  Yeah, that sucks.  What was your favorite sax solo for?  Oh, Jungle Land.  Of course.  Yeah? 
[01:56:30]  Jungle Land or Prove It All Night.  What about the hysterical Santa Claus is Coming to Town video, where he comes out just like  Santa, and Bruce can't stop laughing?  Well, that's only...  Santa Claus is coming to town!  Santa Claus is coming!  Santa Claus is coming!  Look, it's a big black Santa!  Santa Claus is coming!  Do you like that video?  I hate it!  Oh, God!  Why?  Bruce is too happy to be there?  Oh, he's laughing at all.  With Clarence. 
[01:57:00]  But you have to see the East Street Band November, December, so you have to fly to see that song.  What?  Whoever they're playing, November, December.  Oh, because they only play it during Christmas.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And so what?  And does Clarence dress like Santa?  Yes.  Or did he?  Yes.  So you go, yay!  And then does Bruce laugh like every time?  He goes...  Like it's still fucking funny 30 years later?  40, but yes.  40.  Yeah.  Where's the big man here?  Ho, ho, ho.  Where's the...  Where's the big man? 
[01:57:30]  And it's like he's behind the porch.  No, this is not the video.  I want to see if he laughs alive enough.  No, the video is the Christmas one from MTV years ago.  That's just from 2007, him doing it on stage.  Oh, he laughs while he's...  Oh, he's just him?  Put MTV in the search or something.  Yeah, MTV.  Yeah, you gotta go old.  You gotta go old school, yo.  It's like 85, I believe, during the River Tour.  Was it?  You don't like that?  You don't like the version of the laughing?  Oh, because he's just laughing, laughing it up.  Just laugh it up, Bruce. 
[01:58:00]  Because the big man comes out dressed as Santa Claus, and it's crazy because it's, you know,  it's Clarence.  Is Bruce Springsteen shutting it down now that the big man's gone?  No, he may just do Solo or Secret Sessions.  Santa Claus!  Oh, here it is.  There it is.  You good Santa going to bring you your new saxophone?  Yes!  He's answering me back.  Oh, they don't have the video rights. 
[01:58:30]  Where's the video?  Let's just go over there.  No, that's not how that fucking video started.  There's like a two-minute open that Bruce does.  Of course there is.  Why not make the song 20 minutes fucking long, Bruce?  We get it.  No one's got the video?  It's just...  Nah, man.  No one's got the video.  That's Bruce.  The original?  I guess Bruce doesn't like the original video either.  I want to see him laughing it up, though.  Yeah, you got to see him laugh it up. 
[01:59:00]  Looks like me.  Let's hear if he laughs it up at the end.  Mm-hmm.  Just...  Yeah.  All right.  That's where he comes out.  He's laughing.  Oh, come on.  Why is he smiling?  Because he...  Oh, that's from Jersey.  Yeah, that's hard to hear.  Of course it is.  Hold on.  Wait.  Let's see if he's calling him out, though.  Fast forward that little bit, Sam.  I'll bite you. 
[01:59:30]  Oh.  Well, who's that?  I guess Clarence wasn't playing that gig.  It might be one of his special Christmas shows.  That's not him?  Yeah, no.  That's where all of them are.  My favorite thing was on the Super Bowl when they throw a penalty flag.  I love that, too.  Oh, God.  What was the penalty flag for?  For rocking too hard.  Oh, shit.  What was the...  Remember when little Stevie throws the penalty...  The ref throws the penalty flag?  Hey, why you?  Oh, it was so bad. 
[02:00:00]  Douche chill.  Sorry.  I really can't take the Bruce.  Roland, I apologize ahead of time, but there's an evil instant feedback coming in from Matt  Man.  You might want to comment, all right, Roland?  It says, Roland, you dumbass.  The River Tour was 81, not 85.  Holy shit.  Yeah, he was right.  I apologize.  Yeah, I was wrong.  85 was a born U.S.  He's fessing up to us.  We got a softer Roland today.  Fessing up.  Roland himself, too.  It's a reflective Roland.  Roland is sad today. 
[02:00:30]  Introspective.  Roland, are you sad?  Yeah, I was sad.  Because he was always nice to all the fans and everything.  Did you meet him?  Yeah, I met him a few times.  Did you have a picture with him?  No, I had a picture.  Yeah, you'll never get that.  I signed the album.  Yeah, I'm a side record.  That's good.  Yeah, I never had a picture.  Did you get your Springsteen photo?  No.  Why can't you get a Springsteen photo?  I was chewed away.  Remember?  Oh, right.  They won't even allow you.  That's right.  Get a fucking picture with your hero.  I was right.  Like, literally, probably less than a foot away from him. 
[02:01:00]  And then I looked up and made eye contact.  And they go, no.  And then he wasn't allowed to get a picture.  Why?  Why?  Because Bruce needs to be shielded from the likes of Roland.  No, actually, no.  Bruce was taking pictures with everyone.  Bruce would have taken a picture with Roland in a second.  Yeah, it was the same thing that happened to Jimmy with Lady Gaga.  Oh, God.  Yeah, I just sat in the corner and cried all night.  I don't doubt it.  He was that close to getting a picture with his hero and wasn't allowed to do it.  Basically, Bruce just turned around.  Or at least they're paying you well around here.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, yeah.  Aw, that's a shame.  I know.  I'm sad, too.  Are you sad that he's gone?  You are, huh?  Yeah.  Because he was always nice.  And then the sax solo.  So, you know, the last tour was like the last East Street Band tour.  Yeah, no one will be able to play like him, right?  Roland's getting choked up a little.  That's right, they can.  No, but his nephew plays like him, Jacob Clemmons.  So, he'll do it.  Well, not anytime soon.  He's got to mourn for a while.  Yeah.  A week.  But at least we'll see Bruce's solo tour soon, this fall. 
[02:02:00]  What would you say to Clarence Clemmons if you could say anything to him?  If he was in the studio, what would you tell him?  Yeah.  Because he never had a chance to.  That's a good question, Jacob.  Yeah, that's good.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Lay off the fried chicken.  Oh, God.  Right, yeah.  Do a sit-up.  Yeah.  What's his favorite fresh air?  How about you go for a nice long walk?  Yeah.  Get some fresh air.  That's not just the headache.  Right.  People should have been throwing Lipitor into that saxophone. 
[02:02:30]  From the audience, just heaving him into the bell of the saxophone.  He needed a blood thinner.  He did.  He needed something for his cholesterol.  The old thick-blood McGillicuddy.  Jesus.  He had sap coming out.  Oh, sir, there's the Super Bowl thing.  Please play that.  All right.  I forgot why they got the penalty flag, but I think it was for Rock and Too Hard.  It was terrible.  Super Bowl.  Super Bowl.  This is two years ago, already? 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  Huh.  Steve, I think it's quitting time already.  I see it ain't solving.  Darn it, we're going to be throwing overtime.  So what?  Man, it's going to be penalty time.  Oh, I don't know about that.  That means a layup day.  It's a layup day.  Oh. 
[02:03:30]  It was through the flag.  Oh.  It's boss time.  Oh, look, I got douche chills.  Why would he, like, do it that way?  I don't know, but at least you have to give it to him.  He's not lip syncing like the other artists do there.  Which has nothing to do with what is so douchey.  Isn't it douchey?  It's also not lip syncing.  And the ref comes in and throws the flag.  And it's not a real ref.  He's an actor ref. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, the band sounds great, but that little bit was a little douchey.  It was horrendous.  Bruce was pointing at his watch.  Yeah, he doesn't have to do that.  He's Bruce.  What time is it?  Boss time!  He does almost every show, though.  Boss time.  Oh, he does?  Yeah.  I know, but he probably shouldn't have to do it.  At least he just said boss time.  That's what we call it when Steve Blatter walks down the hallway.  It's boss time!  Exactly.  I always say that when I'm on the bowl.  I'm fucking, I'm straight-legging a deuce out. 
[02:04:30]  Straight-legging a deuce.  You straight-legged a deuce?  What's better than when those fucking shit chills hit your back  and your legs shoot out like you're fucking being electrocuted  and a nice big hard duty tumbles out.  A good fiber duty.  I dropped one yesterday.  No, I'm like, did I not drink water for six months?  What is this thing?  Yeah, it looked like a bunch of taped-together brown Cheerios.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  Or glued together.  It was awful. 
[02:05:00]  Damn.  After so much red wine, it looked like I was shitting plums.  It was terrible.  No push-ups?  Plop.  Plop.  E-Rock, what's the final word on the 20 push-ups for $100?  Let's do it.  I don't know.  Okay.  Get that paper.  Get that paper, kid.  Get that paper.  Come on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get the paper.  Get that paper, kid.  Get the paper.  Get the paper.  No, I'm good, thanks.  Oh, come on.  That's going to piss off Steve, man.  Steve, are you mad?  It's just disturbing. 
[02:05:30]  How well can you be doing that everybody could use $100 in cash?  Why not have an extra $100 bill in your pocket?  I would take $100 right now.  No, I don't.  Yeah, you don't need $100.  I would take it.  Yeah, who gives a shit?  Fuck yeah, man.  $100 is $100.  I don't give a fuck who you are.  Do you realize $100 gets me through?  I can make $100 last for a week and a half of living.  I can live off of $100 for a week and a half.  What do you think E-Rock's about?  He's very confusing.  $420?  I don't know what he's about.  He must be doing really well for himself.  He's very confusing. 
[02:06:00]  Does he get the E-Rock?  It might be a little personal and stuff, but do you come from money?  Is your family more well-to-do than not?  He comes.  He comes from E-Rock.  Sorry, E-Rock.  Yes, his parents have money.  Yeah.  His dad's got money, sure.  A little money.  They do all right.  Yeah.  They do all right.  Born with a silver ladle in your mouth.  See, I knew it.  I didn't want the real answer.  He was setting up his own joke.  No, I wasn't.  You set up your own joke.  I swear to you that just popped in my head. 
[02:06:30]  It was a great line, but did you just set up your own joke?  It just popped in my head.  I swear.  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough.  I'm still relatable.  But you do come from some money, so maybe $100 doesn't mean as much to E-Rock as it does  to the rest of everybody.  You can tell it comes from money because you knew to invest in property.  Yes.  These dumbbells would have just spent it on nonsense.  I spent it on booze.  My money's gone.  That's not nonsense, my friend.  That's fun.  I just think you should do it, and then maybe you can give the $100 to Sam or Troy. 
[02:07:00]  Or charity or something.  Like, yeah, give me my $100, bitch.  I don't even need it.  Either take it, take it, and rip it up, then.  But just prove it.  Write it on fire.  The following people will do the sit-ups for $100.  Sam, Troy, and Steve is in the studio.  Push-ups.  Push-ups.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, but they...  But Sam, I already know you could do $25.  They're all in shape.  So I ain't fucking...  No.  I want a bed where it might not happen.  Troy could definitely do it.  And Steve looks like he could.  Cornholio could definitely fucking do it.  I could do $20. 
[02:07:30]  Cornholio.  Ah, well.  Steve Cornholio.  Oh, that's not nice.  That's not nice.  I probably heard that a thousand times, though.  Yeah, I should do the first one.  Oh, cool.  It's just like a...  People just mispronounce it because it's a guinea-ass name.  I get it.  Sterniolo.  How weird is it that you work for Stern and your last name is Sterniolo?  I don't work for Stern.  I was just listening.  I work for Raw Dog.  Yeah.  Did you used to work for Howard?  No.  If his name was Raw Dogio, that would be a coincidence.  Oh, I get it.  Oh, I thought you did a little something-something for Stern.  No, no, no.  Just a listener. 
[02:08:00]  Wow.  Do you listen to us, too?  We got to the bottom of that.  I do actually listen to you guys, too.  I was just...  Not when we first got here, though.  When you...  When your first day you came in, I was a little nervous, actually, because you were hanging  out by my desk, and I was listening to Stern.  I was like...  He's going to get me out of that.  I don't know.  I don't know what goes on beyond the scenes of radio things.  Yeah, I respect you didn't turn the dial.  Yeah.  All the fucking idiots would have turned the dial and make-believe.  I will admit this, though.  I got uncomfortable.  I was like, I don't know if I should.  Oh, damn.  Should I go to the virus right now, or...  I didn't know. 
[02:08:30]  Nah.  I left it.  Look at the TV.  Oh, my God.  New York's favorite newspaper game starts today.  What is this?  Scratch and Match is back today, bigger and better than ever.  But he bought you lunch after he stole your money.  Wait, is this a real article that appeared?  Yeah.  Eric from Brooklyn.  Look at that.  Look at that dreamy look on his face.  He really always has a dreamy look.  What are we looking at?  Because the listeners don't understand.  It's a page in the newspaper.  How long ago was this?  This is 2005.  Yeah. 
[02:09:00]  Submitted game cards from the March 19th game, in which an error occurred, of course.  And it was promised a random drawing by the New York Daily News.  Those selected in the drawing have been notified by mail.  Let's see.  The value of all the prizes is more than a million dollars.  And I guess these are all the winners.  You were a $100,000 winner.  And then I guess there's a couple of other winners, and other people won different denominations.  Yeah, there was five $100,000 winners.  Oh. 
[02:09:30]  Damn it.  You were one of five.  That's nice.  But, yeah, look at that picture, though.  Dreamy.  Wow.  You really do know how to put on those bedroom eyes.  Look how thin I was.  And that kitchen mouth.  I thought you were going to say that.  You know how to put on those.  I have to.  But you look at old pictures.  Everyone has fucking gained weight.  I've actually lost weight.  I just wanted to make it about me. 
[02:10:00]  Job well done.  I see old pictures of E-Rock from fucking four years ago.  I can't believe you're the same guy.  Yeah.  This place has done it to you, huh?  See?  This place, you guys, everything.  That was his way of saying no, asshole.  It's you and Ed and Jimmy.  Not this place.  It's you guys, specifically.  March 19th.  Did you say March 19th?  Let's see.  I'm going to read it to you.  Submitted game cards from the March 19th game. 
[02:10:30]  Now, March 19th.  You said 2004, right?  No, 2005.  Oh.  But I'll say this, though.  March 19th.  And then we found out.  Might have been the day that it.  The game card might not have been March 19th.  From the March 19th game.  That's probably when the promotion started.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Because I found out in October of 2005.  Sam was so trying to hang you out to dry right there.  2004, man.  He was off a year. 
[02:11:00]  That would have been ugly.  Oh, man.  That would have been ugly.  That was some...  Look at that sexy look.  That's the same look he had in the picture with Paris Hilton.  Where he kind of puts his head down.  And the same one he had with Lindsay Lohan.  What's his Paris Hilton picture?  It is fucking horrendous.  Oh, hang on.  Just terrible.  I took that photo.  Did I?  Yeah.  Yeah, you did.  I can't believe that...  Some people have photoshopped some stuff.  There's that Pat Fumunaki in there. 
[02:11:30]  Look at his bedroom eyes.  He's got his face nuzzling her.  It's nestled in her hair.  Like they're a couple.  Look at how he's leaning over into her head.  Why are you doing that?  I was nervous.  Holy shit.  She couldn't look unhappier.  No.  Fuck her.  Look how much bigger your head is than hers.  I'm just saying.  Yeah, but her feet are bigger.  Yeah, they are.  She's got horrible feet. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  She's wearing an anchor necklace, too.  That makes sense.  I'm just talking about how she screwed our show up.  It's like an anchor.  No.  Yeah, she was a cunt.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I want to thank Steve from Raw Dog for stopping in.  Yes.  Thanks for having me.  Thanks for clearing that up.  He's got major problems with E-Rock.  It's not that I have problems.  It's just you can see that I just think he has such a great opportunity working where he is  and the amount of money he makes and the show he works for. 
[02:12:30]  And he's just always down.  Huge amounts of money.  He's upset and he's sad.  And he's just defeated.  He's a sad sack.  Yeah.  Life one, E-Rock zero.  It's just he's just unhappy.  Wow.  He's just unhappy.  I think he should be happier.  That's all I'm saying.  E-Rock comment.  Yes.  I think you should be happier.  I'm fine.  You don't look at him.  Because everything else about your life.  You're the one who's all angry about this.  I'm all right.  I'm angry 24 hours a day.  I understand that.  I can admit my own problems.  I get it.  I'm angry.  Eric can't?  No.  Because everything about him besides his words would tell me that he's unhappy. 
[02:13:00]  He can't be happy.  Are you in love with me?  Is this what you're doing?  Oh.  I will admit that I'm a little jealous that you have a great job.  Obviously, you have tons of money if you can't come in here and you don't need to  do push-ups for 100 bucks.  So, yeah, I would maybe take more advantage of that and maybe smile from time to time.  Or maybe work a little harder and, you know, prove myself.  Damn.  Burn right there.  Work hard enough?  Burn.  I mean, that I can't judge.  I'm just saying that I, personally, would work harder.  He describes what Eric looks like in the office to me sometimes behind Eric's back. 
[02:13:30]  This might be a lie.  What's he look like?  This might be a total lie.  What are you saying?  What does he look like when he's sitting in there?  Oh, misshaping molding clay.  Like you can mold him.  Good one.  Good one.  I have an E-Roc.  Good one.  A good one.  You should be happier.  That's it.  I want you to be happy.  Why?  I don't know.  Why do you bring down our mood out there?  Because we're trying to work hard to be happy.  Sam goes out and shits on this dude every day. 
[02:14:00]  No, I don't.  Every day.  No, I don't.  I never talk to Steve other than hi in the morning and that's it.  Maybe he should be a little more polite.  Maybe it's not what you're saying.  Maybe it's how you look and just the way you're putting out a vibe, maybe.  That's what I'm just saying.  Maybe that's what he's picking up on.  Yeah.  An unhappy vibe.  You're not happy.  Troy and Sam are always happy when they're out there, smiling.  Where's Troy?  Troy hates you, too.  Troy doesn't hate me.  Troy doesn't get along just fine.  Where's Troy?  Troy has no filter.  He'll tell you if he hates you. 
[02:14:30]  Troy doesn't hate me.  He's got a hairline trigger with me, though.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Sam's just happy as long as he's shitting on somebody.  Troy.  Which is all the time.  What do you have to say as far as, do you hate Steve, first of all, from Raw Dog?  I like Steve, but Steve sometimes will think he's an insult comic.  That's a lot.  Oh, damn. 
[02:15:00]  Are you saying because he works for Raw Dog, he thinks he's picked up those?  Yeah, he thinks he's real witty, and he thinks he could be jabbing you with insults.  And then I just got to the point where I was like, all right, you know what, fuck this.  And then it was just full on.  And I have a hairline trigger with Steve.  I like Steve, but he'll just say that one thing, and I'll just want to fucking lambast him.  Like, what has he said to you?  No, Troy, this is the problem with Troy, too, because Troy will just...  I love this behind-the-scenes shit.  I love Troy.  I think Troy's awesome.  I think he's funny.  I think he's cool.  We both have worked with Jim, so we communicate that way. 
[02:15:30]  We always talk a lot.  I think Troy just sometimes, he's just in a cunty mood sometimes.  And he should just cheer up sometimes, too.  Like, E-Rock's sad, but here you're just angry sometimes and just in a bad mood for some reason.  So you've got to stay out of fucking your way.  See you next Tuesday.  Sam does that.  And Sam will come and start a conversation with me and Troy.  Me and Troy will start arguing, and then Troy will go, right, Sam?  And Sam's God.  He's already God.  Sam will start and then walk away.  Well, Steve, I mean, also, I'm swamped with work from start to finish. 
[02:16:00]  You heard what he just said about you.  Yeah, I'm going to respond to that.  So Steve will come over, and he'll say the exact same shit every day.  Like what?  He'll go, this is what he does.  He goes, there he is.  There he is.  And then he'll start trying to bullshit with me.  Meanwhile, I've got a pile of fucking work.  Do you really say there he is?  Yeah.  There he is?  Every day.  There he is.  There he is.  He goes, there he is.  There he is.  Wait, but what does that mean?  Nothing.  It means something to Troy, though.  What does that mean?  Well, it's just like, dude, come on.  Another fucking line.  Please.  And Troy's over.  Oh, yeah, because Troy's so creative.  He's got the best line to throw out. 
[02:16:30]  Hilarious.  Perfect.  Where are you leaving?  We don't do that anymore, but Troy did it the other day, which is weird.  It was uncomfortable.  So he thinks because I'm not there to bullshit with him when he's ready to bullshit because  I have to do work, that I'm being cunty.  Troy wants to bullshit when I'm doing work, and then I get cunty and say, go away.  Who does more work between you two?  Troy's spread out over a lot of places.  Yeah, and he does.  Steve does a lot.  He has a new show actually starting today, right? 
[02:17:00]  What's your new show?  We're just doing it for a week.  It's called The Phone Show.  What's The Phone Show?  What?  It's called User Generated Media, for what I've been told by the bigwigs.  What?  Sirius has a phone show?  No, just for the week, and they'll be calling in.  The listeners get to do whatever they want, however they want.  Are they taking over the station?  This is how they're going to try to find people to replace on-air personalities.  They're going to say, who is that caller?  Get in touch with him.  You're not going to pay him.  No, no.  Now it's free.  Free entertainment. 
[02:17:30]  Troy, you make good living, right?  Considering how many channels you're involved with?  Oh, yeah.  No, we just discussed that a little bit ago, remember?  Troy, what do you do?  I don't even know what your job is.  Well, I answer your phones.  Yeah, I know that part, but what else do you do when you're not answering our phones?  Load promos.  Try to come up with ideas for you guys.  And then I produce Jim's show over in the Boneyard.  I'm the voice of Octane, and I have two DJ shifts on Liquid Metal.  Holy shit. 
[02:18:00]  And you make less than Sam.  And you make less than Sam.  Yeah.  But, I mean, it's fine.  It's okay.  Are you okay paying your rent, though?  No, I'm actually not.  I've had to start finding other work.  I mean, DJing.  Yeah.  Which is fine.  Which is completely okay.  I'm okay with it.  That's all right.  Yeah, I'll actually be at the Tally Ho in Bethlehem this Friday.  Tally Ho.  In Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.  And I'm playing the Man Center, which is a huge outside arena.  Yes.  Yes.  In Philadelphia, actually, it's a Saturday. 
[02:18:30]  What?  The Man Center.  What is the Man Center?  That sounds pretty gay.  I'm opening up for Owl City.  Remember the band that did Fireflies?  Who?  He got you.  That's what I was ready to answer.  Oh, no.  That's what I was ready to answer.  You wanted to answer that.  What the fuck is the Man Center?  So you're opening at the Man Center?  Yeah.  It's like a 10,000-person arena. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Why do they call it the Man Center?  I don't know.  They've been in Philly for, I don't even know how long, decades, maybe.  But, yeah, it's a huge arena in Philadelphia.  Wow.  I've never heard of the Man Center.  The Man Center.  Yeah.  It sounds great.  All my dates are at Troy Kwan on Facebook.  T-R-O-Y-Q-U-A-M.  So you actually have to work elsewhere just to make ends meet?  Yeah.  How many hours a week do you work here?  Not as much as Sam.  I'm fascinated by this.  I'm not as much as Sam.  Sam, Sam.  Do you do 40 hours a week?  Oh, yeah.  Sam's a workhorse.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely. 
[02:19:30]  Sam's a workhorse.  Wait, so you work a 40-hour-a-week job, and you can't make ends meet?  No.  But I also live in Manhattan, so.  But it's okay, you know.  Do you have a roommate?  No.  Well, that's why.  Solo in Manhattan, huh?  Yeah, so it's rough, but whatever.  One bedroom?  Yeah.  Studio.  Okay.  So, but it forces you to go, okay, well, this is the way it is.  I like my job.  I like working here.  I like working with you guys.  You know, it's arguably one of the greatest radio shows ever.  Oh.  Arguably.  So, you know.  Couldn't argue that.  Well, I mean, it is.  So I'm excited to be here working with you guys, and, you know, you're just happy for 
[02:20:00]  what you have, and then you got to do what you got to do.  That's how it works.  Yep.  All right.  So how do we wrap this up?  Steve's mad at EROC and Troy.  Troy has a hairline trigger, which people are trying to figure out what that even means.  Yeah, it's either a hair trigger, it's a hair trigger, or you walk a thin line or something.  We're cool, but you'll say that one thing, it'll just rub me the wrong way, and then  it just sets me off.  He doesn't like phone screening jokes.  Why would you say that? 
[02:20:30]  Oh, is there a phone screen joke that he doesn't like?  There's a lot of phone screening.  What's one of your phone screen jokes?  Like, hey, why don't you go just answer a phone or something?  I mean, he'll be busting my balls, and I'd just be like, shouldn't you be answering that  phone?  Or, you know, the normal stuff.  Yeah, a phone screener.  Just phone screening jokes are big out there, and that would usually, that's a hairline trigger  set off.  Yeah.  A hairline trigger again.  It's like, why don't you go do the job that, like, interns usually do if we were allowed  to have them?  Yeah.  I did that job.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Usually, like, five years ago, when I started as an intern.  That's what I was saying.  Do you feel degraded being relegated to a phone screener? 
[02:21:00]  What can you do?  You know what I mean?  Like, I've just...  It's a way in.  Actually, the phone screener's important for our show.  Yeah, you're hosting a phone show, so in essence, you're an on-air phone screener.  That is true.  Very true.  And we're not too far ahead.  What is this phone show?  But I am ahead.  That's true.  But what is the phone show?  Is it now just people calling?  Is it going to be interactions with the host, or do the callers just, like, you plunk them  down and shut your mouth?  No, no, I would put them on.  I'll shut my mouth and give them a chance.  And then the idea is that it's not, you know, like a talk show. 
[02:21:30]  But, I mean, if it sucks, you hang up and you move on.  And the lines are usually pretty lit up.  So the subject matter is completely caller-driven?  It's up to them what they want to do.  Have you listened to the callers?  Yeah.  Callers are horrid.  They're not fun.  They're not good.  It's one in a million that they actually have, like, accurate information for us when we  need that.  But, so to have a whole show based on their input, wow, that's going to stink.  It's something different.  So hopefully it works.  We'll see you today at 1 p.m. East. 
[02:22:00]  Maybe it's just 1 p.m. East.  You know what?  You got me curious, though.  I'm going to listen to that one for about a minute.  Check out the phone show?  We'll check out the phone show.  That's true.  The ONA office is going to be half the calls.  Hello?  I want to go on the phone show.  By the way, by the way, I'm going to call her, by the way.  How does this lead back to E-Rock?  You got to get them push-ups, though.  Yeah.  E-Rock?  A hundred bucks, E-Rock.  Thank you.  Twenty push-ups.  Does that bother you that he wouldn't do 20 push-ups for $100? 
[02:22:30]  I mean, there's so much, Eric, that bothers me.  Yeah.  Troy is what's happening.  I thought you and Eric are close.  We are.  And I do love Eric, but he just does little things that just...  Like what?  Well, just because...  I usually believe E-Rock does it to himself.  He's in poor physical shape.  He can look at us all he wants, but he does it to himself.  He comes in here and does 20 push-ups.  He shuts up a lot of people.  Oh, yeah.  But now this will be discussed for days.  Yeah.  I mean, he just...  He doesn't take care of himself.  He's going to run into unbelievable... 
[02:23:00]  A Clenard's Clenard situation?  Yeah.  And he just...  He just doesn't give a fuck.  So, you know...  E-Rock doesn't know when to come to the table.  Anyone?  Anyone want to feel that one?  Anyone?  Yeah, he's too busy sitting on a chair doing nothing.  Ah, Chip.  I knew Chip would fucking knock it right home.  Good one.  So, what else follows you about E-Rock, Troy?  Just his...  The work ethic.  Troy, it's what Troy fails to say.  It's like he gets...  Like, I get angry, but Troy gets...  Sometimes he just gets disgusted sometimes. 
[02:23:30]  Do you think he's lazy?  That's up to Troy.  Uh, yeah.  Why do you get disgusted with Eric?  He does...  He has...  There's...  Lazy at times...  Oh, my God.  Um...  In his personal life and work life.  Yeah.  I just...  Yeah, I said...  He does...  At times, he just clearly does not give a fuck.  In his personal life and work life, he said yes.  I don't have headphones on, so I don't...  Well, you said yes.  Oh, whatever.  Anyway.  But, yeah, he...  Whatever.  It doesn't matter.  Yes, it does. 
[02:24:00]  He asked a question.  I said...  He's...  He is...  We're trying to build up B-Rock right now.  I wish he would...  In a situation like this, I wish he'd just step up and be like,  Watch this, motherfuckers, and bust out those push-ups.  But he won't do it.  One time you were disgusted is when you guys called him on his trip.  And Troy was like, you couldn't just fucking stay on the phone for like three minutes?  It was hilarious.  Couldn't just talk?  You had to leave the phone and run away?  You were absolutely disgusted.  And I agreed.  It was pretty...  Yeah, we've discussed that a few times. 
[02:24:30]  It was pretty bad.  It wasn't like we were bothering him every day.  I just thought it was funny.  It was one 10-minute segment of one day.  It was funny.  It was great radio.  I'm happy to be a listener.  I'd like just to radio.  And I got to listen.  And it was funny.  And I think you should have just...  You rock.  It was longer than 10 minutes?  Yeah, I'll give you the times.  Hang on a second.  Like seven or eight.  And why did Sam run out of here like a lunatic?  Yeah, what happened?  Sam runs fast in my life.  He's got something.  He's got to instigate.  Hang someone out to drive with.  He's going to go instigate.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was over 45 minutes. 
[02:25:00]  What?  What part?  The whole segment.  No, that was our part.  The actual phone call?  Yes, that's what we're talking about.  We bothered you for maybe 10 minutes on your honeymoon.  Oh, your honeymoon.  What did you think we were talking about?  No, I knew what you were talking about.  You meant the whole segment.  Yeah, we got some great radio out of it.  But we only bothered you for less than 10 minutes.  Whale calls. 
[02:25:30]  Where's Sam?  See you rock laughing.  No?  He's on the head.  What did you say? 
[02:26:00]  Clicking?  Yes, yes.  There you go.  We got that.  He's lonely.  Well, we made him hang up the krill, right?  Why are you still talking?  Don't you have a show to do?  Fuck that guy.  Fuck that guy.  Get it, he rocked.  Yeah.  You can do all you want.  That's what it is.  Some romaine lettuce, carrots, cucumber, some krill, and cheese. 
[02:26:30]  An Italian dressing.  Topped off with some plankton.  I strained it through my baleen.  I didn't know E-Rock had his posse today.  Yeah, he does.  Recognize.  She recognized.  Are you getting tired of this lambasting E-Rock?  Stick up for yourself.  He loves it.  You're not supposed to say that, but okay.  No, this is fine.  I just don't know why he's here.  He's supposed to be doing his own show, and he's been in here for almost half an hour. 
[02:27:00]  Because he understands an opportunity when it's right in front of his face.  He's on air with us.  I was asked to come in, so I came in.  Show's off today.  Show's the fuck up.  I mean, that's unfair and unnecessary.  Jesus hates you.  I know.  Jesus.  That's good.  That's good.  That's good.  I mean, Martin's friend.  This is really uncomfortable having E-Rock stare at me when you're insulting E-Rock and  he's looking right at you.  Really?  Yeah, I don't know.  Sam, I noticed when he was ripping on E-Rock before, was staring at Opie, not at E-Rock. 
[02:27:30]  Ah, right, right, right.  Yeah, Sam doesn't stare at E-Rock's face.  Sam doesn't like looking at his prey when he attacks.  When he attacks, it's just, yeah.  So seriously, who's doing your show if you're not doing it?  Oh, man.  E-Rock, man.  It's a simple answer.  I'm sure Sam could pick up another shift if you don't want to do it.  Ooh.  Sex, man.  I don't think so much.  You and you, man, out the door.  Club Soda Kenny just wrote, some say Eric needs to lean down.  Others say he can't lean over.  Oh.  That was Club Soda Kenny. 
[02:28:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Jesus.  What's he doing having his fucking Abe Lincoln suit jacket ironed?  I hope he needs a cleaning like after the play.  I do, too.  Good luck hitting that tiny head.  I'll take a real mark.  Oh, my God.  Right behind him, you'd have to go through eight shots to hit it.  Poor Kenny's just sitting out there taking it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  Oh, is he out there?  I can't see him. 
[02:28:30]  What are you doing?  How the fuck do you get that done?  The dry hair that would have puffed off of his head like a dandelion.  Right.  Yeah.  It would look like you stepped in a dust pile.  How do we end this?  Do we give everyone a chance to kind of summarize?  Yeah, a little summarize.  Who wants to go first?  I will.  Go back and do your own show.  Oh, yeah.  E-Rock!  E-Rock!  E-Rock!  E-Rock!  E-Rock! 
[02:29:00]  Oh, my God.  My show's on Best of Things at the Chicago Comedy Festival, so the host is back in.  I'm sorry.  Did anybody interview Joe Kuei about what happened or no?  No, not that I know of.  Yeah, so that's why I'm here.  I was asked to come in.  And just because you hate yourself doesn't mean you have to take it out on me.  Oh, shit.  I mean, I think that I was asked to come in here.  I did.  I explained the situation.  I asked Sam, should I leave?  And Sam's like, no, hang around for a minute.  I got brought back in.  I spoke when spoken to.  And just because you stink doesn't mean you have to yell at me. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, well, you know, you're the comedy channel.  You didn't interview Joe Kuei because why would you?  No, do your job, do your job.  Comedy channel, what?  Coming from you, coming from you just shuffling around here, just absolutely just defeated.  I mean, I do my job just fine.  I actually do my job on my face.  Obviously not.  You don't have a Joe Kuei interview.  Oh, yeah, E-Rock.  You know what people call an E-Rock because of what you said?  What?  E-Or Rock.  Because he's just, oh, well, I'm miserable. 
[02:30:00]  What's the matter, E-Or?  I'm hungry.  I just think you shouldn't be so depressed.  I think you have a spot in the show.  I think you have a spot in a cool show.  And you should just, you don't get a dude.  Hopefully there'll be one on your lawn.  Sorry.  Jimmy feels bad.  He knows it's a great line, but I think he feels bad.  All right.  Where's my tail?  The push-up thing was my main concern.  I don't know why E-Rock's got to get all angry. 
[02:30:30]  I just commented on the push-up.  Well, he's not doing them because he knows he can't.  I know.  We all know that.  It's sad.  It'll spin another way, but that's fine.  Troy, to you.  Troy.  With the hairline trigger.  Wrap up.  I want to see Eric get into better physical condition.  And I want to see him, when he's offered a challenge like this, to step up to the plate  and stop just...  I'm not even going to...  Exactly.  My quote is full.  Instead of just...  Like E-Rock's belly.  Instead of just taking it in the ass, just being like...  You know? 
[02:31:00]  You're comedy gold, man.  So...  Come on, man.  Let's get it together.  And you're all right.  Let's do it.  You're all right with Steve.  Yeah, I like Steve.  I like Steve.  Steve's a good dude.  Oh, a little handshake going on right there.  Did you see that?  Yeah, he's a cool guy.  They have a common enemy.  That's why.  He knows.  I think he knows now where to draw the line with his insult comedy.  See, that's just...  It's stupid.  All right.  Whatever.  All right, guys.  See you.  Thanks.  All right. 
[02:31:30]  Thank you, gentlemen.  It's all started with Alex Bennett, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it always comes back to E-Rock.  Poor E-Rock.  E-Rock, did you feel like you were safe when we started this break with an Alex Bennett thing?  I never feel safe around here.  His head's on a swivel the whole time.  Yeah.  He's really got to look around and make sure he's not being attacked.  Where were you?  Bathroom.  What did I miss?  Oh, again, the scurrying the other way.  Ah, that old gag.  Are you wearing a girl thing in your hair today? 
[02:32:00]  No, just a hair band.  What do you got, a scrunchie?  No, it's not a scrunchie.  Why are you wearing a scrunchie?  It's a hair band.  And no scrunchies.  He says it's a scrunchie.  It's no scrunchie.  It looks like a scrunchie.  Scrunchie's not stretchy enough.  It's not big enough.  Gotcha.  What is that?  It's a hair band.  What is that?  It's like a large hair band.  Are you a poison in your head?  It's a hair band.  I get a step up.  I get a step up.  It's been a heartache or something.  What happened to your DNA test?  Yeah, what the fuck?  Everybody asked me about that.  That wasn't me. 
[02:32:30]  I don't even know the results.  Where is it?  But what happened to it?  Is it all back?  Travis has been putting it on the prep sheet for six months.  It's all back.  Oh, let's do it.  Let's do it.  We can come back.  We should do it.  Oh, it's all back?  Yeah, let's do this.  Oh, fuck.  We dropped the ball on that.  All right, we'll do that.  We got Bobo doing some stand-up.  I didn't forget.  Oh, great.  Oh, yeah, we did.  And right now, we're going to do This Day in O&A History, I believe.  Oh, good.  I love these.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents This Day in O&A, our favorite moments from this  very day in Opie and Anthony history. 
[02:33:00]  It was three years ago today, the late Tippi Tom had his prostate checked by our very own  Dr. Steve.  Now, the thing that I'd like to do next is what we talked about earlier, is to check  your prostate and check your rear end.  My prostate, Glenn?  Yep.  Well, that might be a job.  You want to grab my ass?  What we'll do is we'll have you drop your drawers.  Right here?  Yep.  We'll bring up a sheet so that nobody can see you.  So, son, a camera?  No, and I'll just use my finger. 
[02:33:30]  So, you can put the finger up the edge, huh?  Yeah.  Is that okay?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Will you rotate it a little bit?  I'm going to enjoy this process.  You're going for free.  Well, if you're going to put a finger up my ass, I want it to feel good.  And that's the way it is.  Well, when are we going to do this job?  Right now?  Where?  Right here?  Yep.  In front of everybody?  Yep.  Just kind of touch your ankle there. 
[02:34:00]  Just kind of bend over.  You're going to do this?  Yep.  Yep.  Yeah.  All right.  Everybody, I'm going to get checked out.  Let me see what happens here.  Dr. Steve is behind.  Come on, get this asshole out.  All right, here we go.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  This has been This Day in O&A.  In O&A.  Our favorite moments from this very day of O.P. and Anthony history. 
[02:34:30]  Sirius XM.  The virus.  Thanks for calling the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  Fuck you!  Yeah, this fuck you goes off to Paris Hilton.  Paris, fuck you!  You wasted 20 minutes of quality O.P. and Anthony time by sitting there being nothing but a stump.  Fuck you for that, and fuck you for just being Paris Hilton.  Fuck you!  Fuck you! 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, I wanted to give a big fuck you to the girl that was on a rag when I was fucking her in my car.  She didn't tell me she was on a rag.  I'm sitting there fucking banging her, and now it looks like I got fucking splatter art all over my dashboard.  Fuck you, you bleeding cunt.  Fuck you!  This F.U. goes out to my sister Jody.  I get a phone call at fucking work today saying that you called 911 and had an ambulance come and take you to the hospital because you had chest pains.  I drive all the way to fucking Bel Air, and I get a text message from your husband saying she doesn't want any visitors, including your parents, because it stresses you out. 
[02:35:30]  You could have been having a fucking heart attack, and all we wanted to do was come up there and be with you in the ER and make sure you were all right.  You know what? Fuck you!  Fuck you!  I got a big fuck you to my dick.  Not only are that fucking little, but you got a tongue in fucking 20 seconds.  Fuck you, you little prick!  Fuck you!

You have no fucking say.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  This is your official countdown clock.  There are now 67 weeks left on the contract.  Fuck you!  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line. 
[02:36:30]  866-FU-LINE1.  That's 866-FU-LINE1.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  That's great.  Talking about kids during the break.  A little tater tots.  Yeah, my brother and sister had their kids over the house yesterday.  How old are the kids now?  That's fun.  Like two.  Like two and shit, or three or something. 
[02:37:00]  I don't know.  I'm off by a third of their life.  It's, I think, in between two and three.  Some shit like that.  Principal who admitted to spanking students on their birthdays resides.  What's wrong with that?  What the fuck is this?  A little spanking.  You ever do that?  One, two, three, four.  Sure.  Yeah.  You get your birthday wishes.  Yeah.  Block the candle.  Kiss the magic candle.  The magic candle?  Which one's that? 
[02:37:30]  Sure.  Which one's that?  Is that the one that grants you your wish?  Yeah.  You do that.  The magic candle.  You get frosted on your lips.  Oh, Jesus.  Get some frosted in your mouth.  Frosted?  Sure.  Your wishes all come true.  Kiss the magic candle.  Sounds to me like only Uncle Paul's wish is coming true on that occasion.  Yeah, then I'll lay back and we can play turkey pubis. 
[02:38:00]  Come, come, come, come, come.  It was bad enough when it was turkey foot.  Turkey pubis.  Just brings it to a place I don't want to think about.  It's technically not there.  It's not in the genitals, but it's close.  Yeah, close.  It's right there.  It's like a little pale root sticking out.  Jesus.  Pointing downward.  Iowa principal quits amid birthday spanking uproar.  An elementary school principal in eastern Iowa who admitted to spanking students on  the birthday has resigned, submitted his resignation. 
[02:38:30]  Parents complained after learning this guy would call students to his office on their  birthday for spanking.  What's the problem?  How do you think he's going to get away with that?  How long did he get away with it?  This exact scenario happened to Jess.  What?  Get the fuck out of here.  Jess would be Sam's fiance.  All of a sudden the story takes a hot turn.  Extremely hot turn.  Would she do a little radio with us today?  I want to hear from her. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  I bet she would.  I don't know if it was her principal or not, but he used to bring her in.  Every kid would go into the office and pick a toy and then get spankings on their birthday.  Oh.  And like she didn't realize until now, like way later, that she was like, that's kind  of fucked up.  Yeah.  It's really fucked up.  Let me see.  Hang on.  Yeah.  She, uh.  Yeah.  It's a little spanking, huh?  Uh.  Ooh.  A school spanking.  The principal admitted to the spankings in a made letter to parents and provided a photo 
[02:39:30]  of the padded stick he used to give the spankings.  The padded stick?  What the fuck?  Dude, I will.  He'd hit him with a stick, not even his hand?  I will fucking knock the principal out if this shit happens.  Oh.  That'd be great.  What the hell happened to us when we were growing up?  Mole station?  I don't know.  The principal's either.  I don't remember anything like that.  It's appropriate.  I remember getting yelled at and shit like that.  Never hit, though.  So, not a lot of hit kids anymore.  Judge has, we're waiting for Jess, but another spanking story.  Judge has harsh words for mom before sentencing her for spanking her kid. 
[02:40:00]  Her own kid.  You can now be sentenced for spanking your own kid.  Was it excessive?  A judge in Corpus Christi, Texas, had some harsh words for a mother charged with spanking  her own children or child before sentencing.  She got probation.  You don't spank children today, said Judge Jose Longoria.  In the old days, maybe we got spanked, but there was a different quarrel?  What's the word?  Q-U-A-R-R-E-L? 
[02:40:30]  Different quarrel.  Different definition for quarrel, no?  But there was a different quarrel?  Maybe it's a, maybe it's a, I'm going to guess a, an appropriate mode of behavior?  Sure.  To guess.  You don't spank children.  Quarrel.  There you go.  It's, you can if that's how you want to raise your kid.  Look up on the dictionary.  You don't belt them in the fucking face, but.  Spanking is a quarrel.  Q-U-A-R-R-E-L.  Prison. 
[02:41:00]  It was a pretty simple, straightforward spanking case, too, by the way.  So it wasn't.  Really?  So it wasn't excessive.  Q-U-A-R-R-E-L.  Uh, wow.  Oh, the grandmother was the fucking.  She was arrested back in December after the child's grandmother noticed red marks on the child's rear end.  Oh, boy.  Grandmother took the girl who was two at the time to the hospital to be checked out.  Oh, any vaginal.  But they said it wasn't excessive.  Any attrition.  Any vaginal redness.  Here's Jess, Sam's, uh, fianc√©. 
[02:41:30]  Fianc√©.  Jess.  Where's my fianc√©?  Story in the paper today that, uh, some principal would, would invite the kids down to his office for spankings on their birthdays.  Well, he had to resign, and then Sam pipes up and says, this happened to you.  Yeah, actually, all of our, um, all of the kids I used to go to school with, it was the highlight of, of your birthday, because you would get so excited to go to the principal's office.  Well, the principal got so excited, too.  What the fuck?  I mean, the, the way it would go is, uh, you know, it was your birthday, and you would get invited to his office for, like, uh, like a little toy. 
[02:42:00]  He had, like, this big drawer full of, like, um, you know, slingshots or whatever, like.  Oh, everything that was taken from the children through the year.  Right.  Probably in class.  Yeah, pencils and, like, you know, special pencils with, like, letters for names.  Special thick pencils that vibrated.  Yeah.  But he used to do the thing where you'd pick it out, you'd pick out what you wanted, like, you wanted a spinning top or something, and then he'd take it out of the drawer, and then he'd drop it on the ground, and you would have to pick it up, and he would smack you on the rear. 
[02:42:30]  But it wasn't, like, a, like, a hard spanking.  What I was hearing from you is that it was, like, a, like, a redness on the butt.  We never had anything like that.  He tricks you into touching your ass.  Yeah.  But he made it more sexy.  Yes.  Dropping it like, hey, why don't you pick that up now?  Why don't you pick that up for me?  How does a principal think that female students can bend over in his closed-door office to pick something up, and then he can touch their ass?  Well, it was elementary school, and it wasn't just the girls. 
[02:43:00]  It was everyone.  Equal opportunity.  That makes it so much better.  But now that you're older, don't you think that's kind of weird?  Yeah.  Now I'm like, oh, my God.  That guy had some kind of perversion.  That makes it so much better.  But we had no idea when we were younger, no idea that it wasn't, like, totally the cool thing to do for your birthday.  God, I want to be a teacher in the 70s.  They must have got away with murder.  Oh, yeah.  Because now they're only, you know, getting the teachers on having sex with their students.  Yeah.  You know that had to be going on the whole time. 
[02:43:30]  They finally said enough is enough.  But who thought that was cool?  Like, oh, someone's going to drop a dreidel, and I'm going to pick it up and have my ass grabbed.  It's exciting to, you know, it's the attention.  You know, you're a little kid.  It's exciting to go to the principal's office and get a treat, and, you know, it was the attention, I think.  Yeah.  Did it sting a little bit?  No.  It wasn't hard.  It was nothing like what I overheard you saying from the story.  It was just like a little swat.  No, there's two different stories.  I don't know about this. 
[02:44:00]  This doesn't sound right at all.  No, it doesn't sound right.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Pick up the gift.  Get yourself a swat and a fanny, Jess.  You've got to figure, how many students in that class?  In the elementary school, Jess, there was 30 students per class, and there was at least five or six classes.  I mean, for a second.  You've got to assume he was smacking someone's ass almost every day.  Or at least once a week. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, or then sometimes he'd get like two people that probably had the same birthdays.  Wow, what a pervert.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, I just, I don't know.  I think it was just...  That's great.  Nobody thought about it.  I love this guy.  Is he still teaching?  No, no, he's long gone.  I'm sure he's retired.  He's got, you know, I think he left a long time ago.  Jess, you do know he was jerking off, so you left the principal's office, right?  Yes.  Like, we're going to be, as soon as this call is over, young, young, cute Jess, bending over. 
[02:45:00]  I was very, I was very cute.  Were you?  Was she?  You saw pictures?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What would you wear to school that day?  Oh, God.  Oh, just a skirt, no panties.  Yeah.  She's fucking fine.  Exactly.  She knew.  She knew he meant...  Leotard.  Did you have on a leotard?  Yeah, you know, it was 80s.  Oh.  With the leotards and the vests and like this.  Yeah.  Leg warmers.  The shirt, yep, and the ruffles on the socks and everything.  Yeah, yeah.  Nate in Philly, I don't have time to go to him, but he says, does Jess's principal run a bike  shop? 
[02:45:30]  Did anyone ever spill paint on you and want to maybe record it for prosperity?  Not to my recollection.  Yeah.  That's just plain fucked up.  I know, but we just had no idea.  No, in retrospect, it's obviously like, so I can't even believe it, but yeah, we did.  You guys have a lot of lovey-dovey pictures on your Facebook.  I'm looking at a lot of lovey-dovey pictures.  Yeah, yeah.  What's wrong with that?  I mean.  We like each other.  Yeah, you seem to.  Look at that. 
[02:46:00]  You know, we're together six years now.  Wow.  I know.  Six years.  If I had just held out one more year, it would be like a civil union.  We wouldn't even have to get married.  Yeah.  See?  It'd be no problem.  Yeah, you'd get like a...  Oh, he's trying to find a picture of you and you're a little tater, but you're not.  I don't think I have any on there.  Wait.  We have a...  Sam's DNA.  Don't open it yet.  Maybe you should stay on the phone for this.  Don't open it yet.  You don't look at it yet.  I'm opening.  You shouldn't look at it yet, though.  Highly confidential and official.  So we have the envelope right here.  Well, let's think.  That's what I'm saying.  Let's think.  Let's guess what you think. 
[02:46:30]  Well, Travis saw the results.  So what do we do here?  Well, I think they're going to be pretty self-explanatory.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  All right.  There's a sheet of paper in there, and it will give you an idea of where Sam's relatives  are spanning the globe.  Here it is.  Cool.  We have an idea, and always have, that our own Sam Roberts has to have some kind of black  blood in him.  Yes.  One of his relatives from way back, way back, was Thomas Jefferson, who we know had sexual 
[02:47:00]  liaisons with his slaves.  And there's a whole bunch of people that show up at the Jefferson Family Reunion, and they're  all black.  Oh, yeah.  So we're wondering, is he black?  Right.  Yeah.  No.  Does he have some black in him?  I think there's something to that.  Because some of his features and hair, exactly.  Yep.  So, we had his DNA sent out.  They swabbed his inner cheek, sent the DNA sample out. 
[02:47:30]  It came back a while ago, but we're finally getting into this.  And right here, I have Sam's DNA results, highly confidential and official, right here,  in this official Travis Horrid handwriting envelope.  From the mailroom upstairs.  Yeah, from the mailroom upstairs.  Will this change wedding plans, if you find out he's black?  Yeah, yeah.  What about that?  It's very exciting to find out.  Whoa.  What if there's black in him?  Does he have a big Johnson?  How dare you?  Does Sam have a big Johnson? 
[02:48:00]  He does all right.  Would you maybe not?  That doesn't mean bad.  That means all right.  All right's never all right.  It might be just fine.  Would you shun him if he had black in him?  Not at all.  Not at all?  No.  Uh-oh.  Suddenly, I'm not as attracted to Jess.  That might be a good thing.  I really don't think I'm your type, man.  Why?  Because I'm not...  You know me.  She was about to say, because I'm not racist.  Oh.  I said, because I'm not racist.  Oh.  Well, you could have said that. 
[02:48:30]  That's accurate.  Jess.  I like a girl that could throw an N-word around.  Like it's the...  Jess, did you get a little uncomfortable on Saturday talking to Anthony?  Yes.  And it made me feel so uncomfortable.  Sam's mom was listening.  Oh.  I hope she doesn't feel differently about me.  She listens to every show.  Of course she does.  Of course she does.  Why wouldn't she listen to her only child?  She's baking congratulatory cookies for you.  I wonder right now if his mother's screaming at the radio not to read these results. 
[02:49:00]  Don't read it.  She might know the answer.  Like she might know the answer.  Yeah.  Oh, she already knows.  Is there a...  She might be making some congratulatory sweet potato pie.  Regardless of what the answer is on this.  Yes.  Is there any type of percentages that would be involved if he is black or isn't?  It's not a percent thing.  No.  You're going to see a page and a half of countries and then percentages. 
[02:49:30]  And origins.  Oh, he's so black.  There are percentages?  I just read Travis.  I actually...  I do believe so.  What are you, Bobo all of a sudden?  Yeah, that's right.  There's no...  It's not percentages.  No, no, no, no.  You're going to see countries and percentages.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no.  No, no.  Wait, hang on.  I have...  73.  Let me see.  Okay.  Take a look.  I didn't think that was a difficult of a question.  Give me Sharpie.  Give me Sharpie, please.  Yes, there are percentages.  Thank you, sir.  Sharpie, I am putting... 
[02:50:00]  And now, are there some countries on there that are zero, like nothing?  No, they didn't put the country there.  Okay, they didn't put the country there.  A lot of country.  Okay, here I...  I'm putting down this.  That's right.  That's not what it is.  I think you'll be surprised.  That's not a country.  This is a continent.  But just some country in...  I'll put sub-Saharan...  Yeah.  African nation.  And I am going to put... 
[02:50:30]  I just wish you guys thought of me as a human being, not as, you know...  We do.  Racially.  Okay.  I'm making it very simple.  I think you're 75% black.  That's a lot.  Jesus Christ.  I even went 10.  I put 10%.  What happened?  I mean, I'm very light-skinned for 75% black.  I put 10%.  But you have all the other features.  Well, I mean...  I just have curly hair.  Can we turn this over?  I need to know.  Hold on, hold on.  I say he's a little percent... 
[02:51:00]  Now, you're going to see three different sections.  Exact matches, one-step mutations, and then two-step mutations.  Mutations?  What can you do?  Yeah, so obviously, exact matches is...  Are you like Magneto?  Yeah, I just have to get an egg.  I feel like...  You're Magnegro.  He's an X-Men mutant.  All right, let's just look at it.  All right, here we go.  Let's take a look.  Jess, are you hoping more one way or the other?  Let's see.  Czech Republic.  Here are the exact matches.  Czech Republic.  Czech Republic.  Your matches. 
[02:51:30]  One.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  He is 0.2% Czech Republic.  Okay.  England.  15.  15.  She moaned at that.  She loves British people.  0.1%.  0.1%.  It's even less, because I get this country total.  There's a larger group in England or whatever.  Yeah.  So it's 0.1%.  That is the percent of the people we have tested from this country who match you.  Who match you.  Germany, 1%. 
[02:52:00]  Less than 1%.  Less than 1%.  Less than 0.1%.  Oh, yeah.  0.1%, yeah.  Puerto Rican.  Yes, there is a match on Puerto Rican.  Yes, fingers crossed.  Oh, the first sign of dirty blood.  0.5%.  Oh, man.  So mostly so far, Puerto Rican.  A half a percent of Puerto Rican.  A half percent of Puerto Rican.  Is that exciting, Jess?  Oh, yes.  I'm exotic.  Wait, is that what percent Sam is, Puerto Rican?  No, that's the percent of the people that they have tested from that country that match Sam. 
[02:52:30]  Oh.  Okay.  So far, a lot of low percentages, man.  Yeah.  That's going to be a doozy.  United Kingdom.  Great Britain.  It's not the percentage.  It's not going to equal out to 100.  Yeah.  Come on, brother.  What's that, Mars?  It's happening.  All right.  She's doing a Puerto Rican thing.  What did your mother do?  Is she a merchant marine?  Belgian.  We're looking at a full percent of Belgian.  Yeah.  You're going to find a lot more matches in the one-step mutations.  One-step mutations.  Which means what?  Which means what?  Which means, I believe, that he's just, you know, not directly related, but like... 
[02:53:00]  Close.  You know, right under.  There's something there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Germany.  14 matches.  56.  I want to see where the biggest one is.  It's odd.  It's a lot of just...  Very difficult.  Extremely low percentages.  So confused.  Yeah.  102 is going to be the biggest.  Nothing points out.  102, Scotland.  Or pops out at you.  0.9% for Scotland.  You're almost 1% Scotland.  Scottish.  Scottish.  Scottish.  Kingdom three again. 
[02:53:30]  Switzerland.  There's like...  I don't see anything even near...  Yeah.  ...where it's sunny.  You're whiter than all of us.  Yes.  Uh-huh.  How does that happen?  Uh-huh.  France.  Where's the black stuff?  There.  None.  What?  The Puerto Rican.  That's it.  It's a little half a percent of Puerto Rican.  He didn't match up to any black countries?  No.  Maybe they don't measure black countries.  What the fuck?  Well, that's racist.  Just racist people.  I'm more confused now than I've ever been, to tell you the truth, after this DNA test.  Yeah, you're like a little of everything. 
[02:54:00]  Sam is whiter than any of us.  Told you.  Lots of Scotland, England, Ireland.  Percentages above 2% are considered significant indicators of your family's origin.  And you don't have any that are even close to 2%.  Perhaps the mystery just deepens.  The mystery does deepen.  You're across the board.  Black Scottish.  You're from snow.  Jess, are you disappointed that there's not as much exotic blood in me as you thought there might be?  A little.  But I'm really, I'm more than anything, I'm just worried that you and I are related in some way. 
[02:54:30]  Why would you be worried about that?  How great would that be?  Fucking, you have kids, their eyes are exactly close together.  Creeping, misshapen children.  Because I'm related to Winston Churchill, he's related to Thomas Jefferson, we've got all  of these kind of like similar backstories.  Yeah, but I wasn't molested as a kid.  Oh shit, by principles.  Well, we're all related.  I wouldn't bet money on that.  Okay, fair enough.  We're all related to some famous old person.  Are we?  Yeah, that's what keeps these people in business. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  How did you find out you were related to Churchill?  My dad did our family tree.  I'm also related to Princess Diana.  She's Princess Diana Spencer before she is a, before she was.  Wait, your last name is not Spencer, is it?  Yes.  Well, it won't be for long.  Ah, boom.  I know, guys.  We'll wreck that with a Roberts.  Wait, if you're related to Princess Diana and you got the same last name, why would you  take Sam's name?  Exactly.  Roberts is a strong name.  I think Jessica, Robert sounds like Jessica Rabbit. 
[02:55:30]  I like that.  Yeah.  So you're marrying Prince Homo.  How dare you?  And look at him.  Ugh.  When are you getting married?  Soon.  Uh, next summer.  Oh.  Are we invited?  Yes.  Yes.  Oh.  Oh, she had to say yes first.  Yeah, yeah.  Honey, poopsie, are we invited?  Of course.  Don't book a gig.  You'll all be invited.  Yeah, I'll need a lot of advance notice.  Wow.  I'll give you the date date.  Steve Blatter is peeking over the monitor like a screensaver.  He's trying to...  As he shows a little head poke up. 
[02:56:00]  He's trying to find out if he gets the invite, too.  Oh.  Does Matt have been getting invites?  Oh.  Well, it's still up in the air.  We'll see.  I mean, they got to...  Until next summer, let's see how the relationship goes.  You know what you say, though?  Do I get an invite?  You go, well, we kicked that upstairs.  We're waiting for an answer.  We're sending it upstairs right now.  It's up to them.  It's not our decision to make, but I'm pulling for you.  I'll tell you this.  You're doing all the right things right now.  Yeah, yeah.  You're doing all the right things to get an invite, and it's looking good.  I'll get back to you.  Yeah.  That could be good news.  The day before the wedding, you'll be like, what happened? 
[02:56:30]  Oh.  At least Travis is being paid well.  Yeah.  Thank God, right?  Does Bobo get an invite?  Okay.  We're moving the subject.  Oh, boy.  No, actually.  I hope Bobo is listening.  He will certainly not be getting an invite.  I got a suit.  Unless he could come to the wedding.  Maybe he could do some stand-up at the wedding.  Yes.  Well, entertainment wouldn't be bad.  Oh, let Jessica go.  You're looking for a band, right?  Yeah.  Bye, Jessica.  Bye.  Jess, thank you for calling in.  All right, Jess.  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, go.  When are we doing our staff stand-up night?  I want to do that.  That is a good idea. 
[02:57:00]  There's enough guys here.  That is a good one.  I would like to see that.  I think we should do that.  I think people would enjoy that.  Speaking of stand-up, Bobo stand-up after the break to finish up today's show.  And we'll figure that out, Jimmy.  Yeah, we should do that.  Because I know none of them really want to.  That's why it hasn't gotten done.  That's why it's gotten thrown under the roof.  I understand that, but I'm not going to let it go.  I think it would be fun.  I think it would be very funny if we get so much great audio for the show.  It's pure audio.  Bobo stand-up next?  Yeah, please.  I got to hear that. 
[02:57:30]  The Virus Series X.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Well, that same thing was a letdown. 
[02:58:00]  I know.  I was hoping for some Negro, some Negroid, I believe it's called.  Negroid.  When you're talking about it in genetic terminology.  Is it really?  Yeah.  And I believe we're Caucasoid for Caucasians and Asians are Mongoloid.  Yes.  Wow.  I remember seeing that in a history book.  So why, if you say Mongoloid, that's a bad thing? 
[02:58:30]  Well, I kind of adopted that as a synonym for Down syndrome.  And I do believe it was because of the eyes.  And most people, by the way, when they see it.  You're probably right.  The Asian eyes and then the very almond-shaped eyes of some child with Down syndrome.  And I believe they mixed the two up back in the ancient days.  And that's what makes them better at math.  Right.  Anthony the Greek. 
[02:59:00]  Anthony the Greek.  You know, back in the days when the Mongoloids.  They would breed their.  Yeah.  They would breed their, you know, their strong Mongoloid men.  That's what they did.  And they called it Negroid.  I remember seeing that in a history book when I was a kid.  And kind of going.  And I would call, like, black kids that were in school, Negroids.  Really?  I'd be like, hey, Negroid.  And he would call me, like, Caucasoid.  Oh, wow.  Because you're, you know, Caucasian. 
[02:59:30]  But it didn't really hurt me as much.  No.  Like the N-word.  Boy, the antics never stopped in that school, did they?  Douchey kids.  Just a laugh riot.  Right up until I started crying about something.  Of course.  Of course I did.  I'm not a Caucasoid.  Shut up.  The Negroid punches me in the face.  You were a cock-a-sucker.  Float chart.  Float chart.  Float chart.  I was just molested or something. 
[03:00:00]  No, no.  That was voluntary.  Of course it was.  Fair enough.  You guys want to hear about the man that had 48 beers?  Have you ever had 48 beers?  Sitting next to him.  Yeah, I know.  Right there on the weekend.  Have you ever had 48 in one sitting?  Let me think.  Two cases.  That's two cases of beer?  Yeah.  In a 24-hour period?  Yeah.  That's possible.  Let me think.  24 hours.  But that's staying up all night party, constantly drinking.  I think that's very possible.  That's two beers an hour? 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  For 24 hours?  For 24 hours?  That's a little rough.  Two beers an hour.  24 hours.  But that's 24 hours.  Yeah.  That starts catching up.  I've probably had a case.  That's catching up on you.  I've probably had a case of beer.  24 beers?  In like, yeah, because there's times where I could have like five beers in an hour.  And then, you know, you slow down.  Right.  It averages out, though.  Well, in Florida, a man told the sheriff there, he had about 10 beers too many as he  celebrated his birthday.  10 too many? 
[03:01:00]  So that means he was okay with 38.  38 is good.  Right.  He's like...  That's fine.  Look, he's basically saying, you've got to give me the first 38.  Yeah.  Come on.  I know what I could do with 38 beers.  The problem was I had 10 more after.  I knew I shouldn't have that last 10.  58-year-old James Taylor says he drank 48 beers on Thursday evening.  Wow.  It was a Thursday.  It was a Thursday.  Hey, it's the new Friday.  Prompting a stern lecture. 
[03:01:30]  Ooh.  Nah, I shouldn't drink so much.  From a deputy causing a disturbance.  Officials say James Taylor, a transient, left the beach, but he came back.  And officials say this time he caused such a ruckus.  A ruckus?  That he scared a woman and her young grandchildren.  Yeah.  He looks like a ruckus maker.  An arrest report states that Taylor, and I don't know why this makes me laugh every  fucking time.  It was horrific, I guess, for that woman.  But Taylor exposed his genitals and urinated in the middle of the sand.  Oh, boy. 
[03:02:00]  And he was shouting profanities.  They love showing their genitals, those transients.  Sure they do.  Basically, he said, look, man, I had fucking 10 beers too many.  Yeah.  Oh, that's what he looks like?  Yeah.  He looks like, uh, who?  I don't know.  A very bald Ernest Hemingway.  Okay.  Okay.  Let's say Fez if he was bald.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  A little bit.  Oh, what's the matter?  No.  Does Fez?  Oh, never mind.  I forgot we're not a lot of joke anymore. 
[03:02:30]  Anyway, let's move on.  What?  What happened?  Is that it?  We can't say anything?  It's not worth it.  Because I don't know.  It's not worth it.  I haven't really been keeping tabs.  I don't know.  Is it, uh, like, no, is it untouchable?  Yeah.  We were...  He's untouchable?  I mean, who said that?  Yeah, what?  Sam and the mic.  Who said that?  Yeah, what are you doing?  Sam, what happened?  Comment?  Is it because of the Roland thing?  Yeah. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  What happened?  Yeah, what happened?  It was brought up that that conflict has been squashed, and we should move forward without,  you know...  Bringing it up.  Any relatable, you know, yeah, bringing it up.  Kind of like the Travis kicking the balls thing.  Don't know what you're talking about.  Don't ever bring that up again, either.  That one's been wiped from the old memory.  Really?  Yeah.  They flash that men in black thing in front of your eyes, and...  That's correct.  You don't remember that?  Gone.  See, because apparently Travis had kicked one of the testicles. 
[03:03:30]  We don't know.  Oh.  Travis just throws his arms up.  Yeah, wow.  Travis is like...  Come on, man.  Help me out.  It wasn't actually a kick.  He just put a little shoe on his tongue.  Yeah.  To make it look like a kick.  It just might have to be one of the stories in the book.  Yeah.  Why don't we do Bobo?  Good idea.  That's a safe target.  I want to hear Bobo doing stand-up.  You got the video, so I don't need this over here.  Oh, there's video and everything.  How much time does he do?  Wow.  He explained to me when I talked to him on Friday that he did seven minutes, and I said, 
[03:04:00]  Bobo, the video is three minutes.  And he said, no, no.  I had seven minutes.  I didn't use them all.  Oh, oh.  He used three of the seven.  He used three of the seven.  Yes.  Was he out of material?  He said in the three minutes, he considered the jokes he told to be two jokes.  He could have worked the crowd, though.  He did not.  With the other time.  He did not work the crowd.  Oh, Bobo.  All right.  Apparently, he's calling in right now.  Of course, yeah. 
[03:04:30]  Well, I wouldn't be.  All right.  So, this was Heather Height.  Heather Height put on the whole show.  Put Bobo on the bill?  Put him on, yeah.  She's smart.  That's great.  She's smart for doing that.  Yeah, why not?  Brings attention to her comedy show.  I'm sorry I did that.  Oh, go the fuck to sleep.  Yeah, we still haven't played that.  Fuck.  You heard about the...  I thought you were talking to me.  I'm exhausted.  Sam's father turned me on to this damn thing.  Maybe tomorrow?  What's that?  A disappointing son?  That's not the case. 
[03:05:00]  The world's greatest treat of all time.  It's a huge bestseller.  It's called Go the Fuck to Sleep.  It's a kid's book.  Yeah.  And now they got Sam Jackson reading from the book.  Oh, that's kind of cool.  It's really cool.  And Sam's father's all proud that he mentioned it way before the media did.  He did.  All right.  We'll do that maybe tomorrow.  Here's Bobo.  Doing stand-up for Heather Height's comedy show.  His first comic is really funny.  You've heard him on the opening day of the show.  Let's give it up for a... 
[03:05:30]  I guess it's just whoever's hosting.  I didn't get the name.  Heather Height didn't post the name.  Sexy voice.  Yeah, exactly.  Jesus.  But why would she say really funny?  I guess you wanted to introduce him the way you would a comedian.  It's just standard.  It just comes out of your mouth and you realize it's happening.  Very funny.  She's probably never even seen him.  I wouldn't think so.  Not if that's the description.  You may have seen him standing in a payphone in Queens.  All right.  All right.  You might recognize your next act if you drank while you had an infant in the womb. 
[03:06:00]  By the way.  Wait.  Something's going on with Fez today?  James in North Carolina.  Hurry up, James.  James.  Hey, Fez is changing his name to D-Man today.  And officially on the Ron and Fez show.  And he's coming out of the closet.  He's officially admitting that he's gay.  So everybody listen to Ron and Fez live at 11 o'clock.  Oh, it's live finally?  Yeah, Ron is back.  And I've heard.  He's a changed man from that. 
[03:06:30]  Is he?  Oh, yeah.  He saw some shit.  Changed him?  A little post-traumatic stress?  Yeah, I heard him talk about it.  He said he saw some shit.  He's a changed man.  Wow.  Wait.  So Fez's character is doing some?  From what I've heard, the Fez character has run its course.  Again, I haven't heard every single detail.  From what I can infer, it seems as though the themes that they've been going with is that  the Fez character has run its course.  And that the person who plays Fez will be now changing.  Fez D-Man. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, changing.  The D-Man?  The D-Man.  What does D-Man stand for?  It's like the Z-Man, I think.  Why D-Man?  The D-Man.  I'm not sure.  Hey, Ant.  Is he going to be talking about his dick?  Problem?  I don't know.  Problem?  Ant.  Problem?  Ant.  Problem?  Did you see?  What's that deal about Sam and the guy from The Wire being gay?  What was the way on that on your Twitter? 
[03:07:30]  The worst synopsis of a tweet of all time.  Yeah, yeah.  Really?  Yes.  All right, fuck it.  Let's get back to both.  God, the fucking listeners.  Phone show coming.  Yeah, yeah.  By the way, SiriusXM has decided that gems like that should have their own show.  Oh, hey, we got the D-Man info out.  Oh, we did.  Fez might be moving on.  What's his real name?  I'm not going to say that in case he doesn't want it said.  It's not going to come from my mouth.  Has it been on the show?  They've said it on the show a few times.  Ron has said it many times. 
[03:08:00]  Well, what do we call him if he's not Fez anymore?  D-Man.  D-Man.  So if I see him walking around, I've got to go, hey, D-Man.  I've known him for 10 years.  Just ask him what his name is.  If you see him today.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Just let him say it.  All right.  What's your name?  D-Man.  D-Man.  All right.  Let's go to the Bobo stand-up.  Sorry.  Let's listen.  His first comic up is really funny.  You've heard him on the opening day of the show.  Let's give it up for Bobo.  The person I can't say her name is Bobo.  She has nice shoulders.  Yeah, come on, guys.  Stand up.  Stand up. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, God.  And I have to tell you, I wound up with an embarrassment a few weeks ago.  Pause that.  Oh, God.  It's great.  He's wearing the shirt I gave him.  No.  I've worn that shirt on television.  I thought it looked familiar.  Yes.  He's proud, Jimmy.  Dude, I knew that shirt looked familiar.  That is one of your shirts.  You wore that on TV?  I wore that when I did the Metro Channel show back in 2001.  I've seen that shirt. 
[03:09:00]  And Robert Klein hosted.  And I remember that was the shirt I was wearing on that show.  That is such a Jimmy shirt.  His shirt.  Yeah.  Like, you could tell.  Wow.  When Colin told me I looked like a Cuban domino player, right?  But he was happy that you gave him a shirt.  That probably means everything to him, Jimmy.  I gave him underwear.  Go ahead, Bobo.  I wound up with an embarrassment a few weeks ago.  Can we rewind a little bit?  I want to show you what he did wrong immediately. 
[03:09:30]  All right.  When he first comes out?  Yeah.  This is what...  Okay.  I started to breathe when the doctor smacked him.  I have to tell you, I wound up with an embarrassment.  Right there.  Not one moment of greeting the audience.  No, no.  It's everything that makes you hate him in person.  I have to tell you.  Okay.  Hey, you know, I want time.  Remember, how about fucking hello?  Yeah.  How you doing tonight?  Well, just a hello or a moment of pause. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  Hello.  I'm Bobo.  Wait for the applause.  Wait for the applause.  Just babbles.  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Bobo.  I'm Bobo.  Like, after...  Because they're all just going crazy.  All right.  I tell you, I wound up with an embarrassment a few weeks ago.  And I thought I was going to close to finally achieving the goal of losing my virginity before the age of 30.  I'm one year close to it, away from it. 
[03:10:30]  Well, like this girl, I'm talking to her.  And we were in the bathroom.  And all of a sudden, she starts laughing.  And I'm saying, look, she says, I never freaking seen something that tiny.  She starts singing the song, it's a small dick after all.  It's a small dick after all.  I wound up spending more money on beer than I ever have in my entire life after that.  Wait, what? 
[03:11:00]  Oh, my God.  He wound up spending more money on beer than he ever has in his entire life after that.  Why is he in the bathroom with a girl?  Oh, my God.  Exactly.  And he blew over.  Anything that might have had punchline potentially, just what else is new, just fucking tramples it.  Barrels through it.  Barrels through it.  Barrels.  Oh, my God.  Like, the idea that you're a virgin at that age.  How about you expand on that a little bit?  Yeah, a little bit.  29. 
[03:11:30]  It's a small dick after all.  I thought he was going to do the whole song.  Yeah.  She started singing the song, it's a small dick after all.  No place to laugh.  It's a small dick after.  Yeah.  No pizzazz, no emphasis.  Oh, he's got nothing.  Just says it.  Jimmy gets so much.  It drives me nuts.  He is the worst, man.  All right, let's continue.  Oof.  It's good so far.  And it wasn't enough enough.  It wasn't enough.  I came home running into that annoying neighbor. 
[03:12:00]  And I can tell you, I'm sure I'm sure a lot of you have had crazy neighbors.  Yeah.  Jerry.  Well, I feel I've had the craziest in the world.  Really?  I got these people.  They're from some European nation.  I don't know what.  I have no freaking clue what nation they're from.  With these crazy neighbors.  And they got so many of them coming in and out of the apartment.  I keep thinking it's an overcrowded roach motel. 
[03:12:30]  And they always have this evil...  Pause that.  His fucking incessant stammering is maddening.  Because he backs up eight words.  And then I was going to go down to...  What's going to go down to the...  What are you doing?  Stop restarting in the middle.  It's like he's hitting the fucking...  The back button on a fucking...  When you're watching a DVR.  Yeah.  Just back eight seconds.  Jace was calling him Stephen Wrong. 
[03:13:00]  I love his observations.  Yes.  This is horrible.  Okay.  Coming in and out of the apartment.  I keep thinking it's an overcrowded roach motel.  And they always...  They always have this evil look.  Like it runs from me.  Like this look at the screen.  Don't...  Don't...  Don't lock the door when I come out to smoke.  I says...  Yeah, thanks.  I'll make sure I do that. 
[03:13:30]  I lock the door anyway.  Just to spite him.  And he's always cursing out of here.  I lock the door just to spite him.  These aren't jokes.  These are...  This is his dumbass life.  Oh, God.  Aren't you supposed to spin your dumbass life into jokes?  If you're a standout?  He somehow managed to remove the humor. 
[03:14:00]  Remove any bit of humor from a story.  Whoa.  You know what I love about this tape?  You could hear.  You could feel.  I mean, the uncomfortableness in the room.  Uncomfortable is the audience, yeah.  Even though this is a tape.  Yeah.  You don't see the audience.  Nothing.  But you could feel how uncomfortable they are.  How much they hate him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, anyway, just to spite him, he's always cursing at me in some European or Russian language.  I don't know what kind of communist language that guy is saying. 
[03:14:30]  And then white, she's the worst.  They say, yeah, how many people did you screw over when you worked as a mail-order bride?  And he's the worst.  And he, and he, and he, and he, and our next service is still available.  And I'm telling you, not only have the, they, they, they, they...  Hold on.  Pause.  I can't take this. 
[03:15:00]  He's so unfunny.  He doesn't care.  He's just plowing through.  I like how he's leaving gaps for laughter, for all the guffaws.  All right, I know I've got to be quiet after this,  so they won't hear my next line of the joke because of the laughter.  Nothing.  Did anybody hear about my dog, Mr. Malunikans, Boobots? 
[03:15:30]  The wife, she's the worst.  They say, yeah, how many people did you screw over  when you worked as a mail-order bride?  Spin it out!  That's all, folks.  No, yeah, they take up a lot of space in that apartment.  Enough about your neighbors.  They can't throw around the hallways between the corridor where the stairs are, 
[03:16:00]  between the apartment, between the upstairs apartment and the first-court apartment.  He's giving a whole blueprint of the apartment,  and this material is going over so well,  he feels he's got to do three segments on his dumb neighbors and his interaction with them.  Enough about the neighbors.  Yeah, fuck the neighbors.  You must have hated that moose.  There's no humor value in your neighbors at all.  I think he was next door to the Hitlers. 
[03:16:30]  Not an ounce of humor available.  I hope they're Colombians and cut his throat and pull his tongue through it.  He'd speak clearer.  And then I, what?  A Colombian neck toy.  Hope Mr. Malunikans is fucking running by a city bus.  Stupid, hope his dumb front paws are on over and he just panics and shits.  Yeah, fucking bloody Mr. Malunikans shits all over the rug.  I mean, just because you don't like Bobo in his act  doesn't mean you have to take it out on Mr. Malunikans. 
[03:17:00]  Fuck Mr. Malunikans in the mouth.  He'd run into the fucking apartment with his dumb crush front paws yelping,  and stupid would go,  and then try doing jokes to Mr. Malunikans.  He wouldn't know what to do, so he'd just put him in scalding hot water.  He wouldn't even know that there was something wrong with him.  Yeah.  Did you step in blood?  Mr. Malunikans, you're getting blood all over the carpet.  My goal is to buy big metal shoes  and to give Mr. Malunikans a fucking rib rearranging.  I'm retired.  You're done? 
[03:17:30]  I'm retired as far as kicking dogs.  Oh, okay.  What Jimmy said just brought back in.  I will pick up where you left off.  Kevin from Connecticut writes,  Bob hopeless.  That's good.  All right, let's wrap it up with Bobo.  This is a big finish.  It's a big finish coming.  Yeah, yeah, he's got to finish big.  I was facing that apartment.  The cats roam around the hallways between the corridor where the stairs are between the apartment,  between the upstairs apartment and the first floor apartment.  And it probably smells like cat piss so badly. 
[03:18:00]  And you know what?  And all they use is this $80 cologne or perfume, whatever it is.  I said, yeah, like that's going to help mad to smell.  You only smell like your country.  Everybody in your country that doesn't take baths.  That's the tub lady from The Shining in the back.  I think that's Heather.  Trying to help him along. 
[03:18:30]  Wow.  You smell like your country.  Your country people that don't take baths, you know, where they're supposed to bathe or things.  Two Jews walk into a bar they owned.  Two Jews.  Two Jews, and one of them went behind the bar, but the thing didn't lift up, so he had to walk underneath.  And the other guy went into the basement to get some kegs out from there because that's where they keep them. 
[03:19:00]  He has no idea what the funny part is.  No.  He reminds me of somebody who's never driven a car, the way they keep stopping and starting and just fucking back.  Yes.  That's what he's doing.  He's stammering through this.  Relentless stammering.  So badly, and you know what?  And all he uses is this $80 cologne or perfume, whatever it is.  I said, yeah, like that's going to help us to smell.  You only smell like your country. 
[03:19:30]  Every one in your country that doesn't take baths.  I can tell you, thanks you guys have been an audience.  You can follow me on Twitter at Radio.  Thanks you guys have been an audience.  Wait, wait, go back.  Did he say thanks you've been an audience?  Yes.  As opposed to a lynch mob, but they should have been.  They would have been justified to be.  That's true.  He goes, do you follow me Radio Bobo 105 XM on Twitter?  Who the fuck is going to follow you after that set? 
[03:20:00]  He's so confused.  Probably everybody.  Yeah.  Everybody in your country that doesn't take baths.  I can tell you, thanks you guys have been an audience.  You can follow me on Twitter at Radio Bobo XM 105.  He just walks off.  Did you hear the little noise he made right before he walked in?  He went, do, do.  Did he?  Let me hear.  Do, do. 
[03:20:30]  Listen to the end of his sentence.  Radio Bobo XM 105.  Oh, wow.  And it takes forever for the host to get back there because he was supposed to do seven  minutes.  Yeah, yeah.  He just walked off.  Well, we got Bobo online.  Oh.  Bobo, how do you think it went there?  I'm not really sure how it went.  We are.  What do you think?  Yeah.  Like, what was the vibe you felt from the audience when you left the stage? 
[03:21:00]  Did people say anything to you?  Give us a little insight.  Well, I know a few people said they liked it.  Yeah.  Who's that?  Fucking competing club owners?  I saw the people, the people, the audience.  Of course, this keeps going.  No concept.  The audience.  So the audience said they liked it.  Were you discouraged by the lack of laughs? 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  Because I noticed you stopped talking.  You left like an opening for people to laugh, and it just came off as awkward silence because  there wasn't any laughs there, Bobo.  Yeah, I did.  I think I heard some laughs.  Well.  Yeah.  It wasn't really, you know.  Were you expecting more?  Yeah.  I was expecting more.  I wasn't sure what to expect with a small crowd. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  What about that material you were doing about the neighbors?  You think that's strong stuff?  I think it is.  Maybe I need to rework it a little bit.  Rework it.  Punch it up a little, you know?  Learn from your experience.  Sure.  Figure out what worked and what didn't.  Yeah.  Why don't you try it out down at the cellar?  Your cellar, not the comedy club.  I was just thinking.  Just go and hang yourself.  In order.  Exactly. 
[03:22:30]  The fucking BTK had a fucking.  That family had a better time in the cellar than the audience in the comedy cellar.  Oh, shit.  Jerking off to their fucking home child.  They have a horrid time in the cellar.  They really had a bad time when Dennis Rader showed up.  Not fun.  So, Esty, the way you get on at the cellar is you need two comedy cellar comedians to recommend you.  Yeah.  Then Esty will look at your tape.  She won't even look at your tape before then.  Right.  Oh, okay.  Just because, you know, she gets a lot of tapes.  Yeah, of course.  And then she puts you on an audition on a late show Friday. 
[03:23:00]  And it's not an easy crowd on a late show Friday.  You go on, like, third.  Yeah.  And a lot of comics don't do well.  Hmm.  And I couldn't do it to her.  But I would so.  Oh, God.  I would love to get him on there on a Friday.  But I couldn't.  I'd never make it through the tape phase.  Get the recommend and then.  I should just do it to make her watch this tape.  Be like, what is this shit?  I've heard this guy's really good.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Really good.  A lot of people talking about him. 
[03:23:30]  New sensation.  Yeah.  You think you got a career there in stand-up comedy, Bobo?  Yeah, I think I do.  I do understand that that's only the, what you saw there was only the beginning.  Right.  Right.  And you did a full set.  And I think there's only one way to go, but get better.  There you go.  Really?  I like hearing that.  What about the fact that you only did half of the time you were supposed to do?  Well, what happened was I wasn't trying to, I was trying to try to get, try to get it 
[03:24:00]  like short enough that it doesn't run too long.  Yeah.  But when they give you seven minutes, you do seven minutes.  They'll let you know when you're running long.  I know that, but I miscalculated it is what happened.  They give you a light in the back, Bobo.  You can usually ask where the light is and then just look for it.  And when you walk on stage, don't just start barreling through material.  Take a second.  Say hello to the audience.  All right.  You don't have to say how you're doing because everybody asks that. 
[03:24:30]  You can.  But you got to have like some connection to the audience.  You don't, you look great in Jim Norton's shirt though.  I got it.  Yeah, you really did.  Thanks.  That's a gift from Jim to you, huh?  Yeah.  That was nice.  I actually like that shirt.  I think it's a nice shirt.  Everybody I know likes it.  You know what you should talk about?  Write a joke about how you were asleep and you had eaten peanut butter.  And you woke up and Mr. Maloonigan climbed up on your chest and was fucking your mouth. 
[03:25:00]  His little red dick.  Write a joke about Mr. Maloonigan fucking your mouth with his red dog dick.  I think I might have to work that about a prank that bugged me.  Yeah, that's smart.  Write it down.  Write that concept down.  Hey, congratulations, by the way, on Ice-T knowing who you are.  I think that's pretty amazing.  Yeah.  What do you think about that?  I think it's pretty amazing.  What did he say?  Why do you think it's amazing?  I didn't hear from Ice-T. 
[03:25:30]  I don't know.  I just heard that he knows who I am.  But you certainly expect an A-lister to know who you are, right, Bobo?  No, I don't really expect A-listers to know who they are, to know who I am.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, he's lying?  I'm saying you're lying.  I've been listening.  First of all, on Friday, when I asked him, how did your comedy set go, he said it went  fantastic, it went great.  You asked him, he said, oh, I don't know, I think it went all right. 
[03:26:00]  On Friday, he said, I figured it was only a matter of time before A-listers started knowing  who Bobo was.  I'm not surprised that Ice-T knows who I am, and I think that A-listers will know who I  am because of my comedy, not my radio career.  Is that true?  Well, what I meant eventually, they'll know who I am.  Oh, boy.  Please don't do what you're thinking of doing.  Eventually, everyone will know me.  Everyone will know me.  That's what Mark David Chapman said on the flight over from Hawaii. 
[03:26:30]  Fuck.  They're all going to know my name.  I'll pump two shots.  Yes.  Gah.  And he's not even laughing.  That's what's even creepier.  All right, Bobo, we're going to cut this short, I think, today.  Yeah.  You're lying, though, Bobo.  It's already too late.  I'm sure if Sam has nothing to do with the 10 o'clock hour, he'll call you back.  It's been a lot of Bobo on the 10 o'clock hour lately.  I know there has.  What were the racial jokes, by the way, that the fake Obama, the Obama impersonator did? 
[03:27:00]  They cut him short.  Oh, a what?  That guy almost looked like Obama.  He did.  Yeah?  Almost.  We can talk about that tomorrow.  Bobo, thank you.  All right, no problem.  By the way, Opie, I got an extra ticket to the vet game on July 16th.  Do you want to go?  Yeah, he'll go.  Get it all.  Bought away.  He said you wanted to go.  Oh, bought away.  Bought away.  The 16th, I think.  Of July?  Yeah.  You're free that day. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, wow.  Maybe I'll go.  You should go.  Bring your camera.  Oh.  I don't want to make it into a thing.  Just two friends going.  Yes.  Not everything has to be filmed.  Sorry, you're right.  Hey, I was given a couple of tickets to, I believe it's a NASCAR event at Indianapolis  Speedway.  Wow.  On the July 9th.  Nice.  I'm not going.  Why?  That's just it.  I was given to give to a listener or something or somebody that wants to go.  Very cool.  Got pit passes, two tickets.  So if you're into NASCAR and you live in Indianapolis or you're going to make the trip, you know, 
[03:28:00]  maybe tweet or something.  Listen tomorrow.  Maybe tweet.  You want to tweet them?  I know someone that wants to go, but they have to get their own fucking travel.  Yeah, they'd have to get their own transportation.  What the fuck?  Who am I?  Rockefeller?  My friend Bill wants to go.  What?  Bill?  Yeah, big NASCAR fan, Bill?  Yeah.  Well, I'll have to know his last name.  Why would you do that? 
[03:28:30]  Ted Lee.  See how he's just waiting for that?  Oh, I know.  Bill Ted.  By the way, I don't think anyone was singing that fucking song all weekend long.  Did it actually enter your head at all?  Oh, wow.  I was fucking doing that all weekend to the point where I was mad at myself.  Wow.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I moved my head back.  I did the mouth open. 
[03:29:00]  I don't know what you're talking about, Ed.  Really?  You didn't sing it either?  What?  It was the Bill Tedley theme song when he comes out.  Oh, wow.  It's B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y, Bill Tedley.  Tell me what?  You've got to open your mouth and turn your head sideways.  Yeah, and then sometimes he'll have a little click when he first does it.  Yeah.  B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y, Bill Tedley.  He has all these little weird versions he does.  Who's he? 
[03:29:30]  I hate Bill Tedley with a passion.  Does he live inside your head?  Bill's around.  He's around at times.  He's a talk show host or whatever he does.  He's opening a show, Anthony.  He's on his premiere show.  Yeah.  Oh, there's not going to be a premiere show.  I'm on after the tomato expert, though.  The tomato expert, Gene something, and then the big band is Pumpkin Fuss.  Pumpkin Fuss.  This isn't happening.  It is happening.  No, it's happening.  The Bill Tedley variety.  No, it's not happening.  And I'm insulted that I'm not invited to this fake variety.  Oh, you'll be on.  Bill Tedley didn't think he could get you. 
[03:30:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Bill Tedley's very shy.  I'm a big get.  All right.  How are you giving those tickets away?  Tomorrow?  Yeah, we'll figure out something tomorrow.  Yeah.  You know, Bobo's a big fan.  Maybe you give him the tickets and make him walk.  That's cool.  I'm a fan.  I love it.  He's a huge fan.  You know what?  Why don't we leave with Sully's version of the Naughty Boy Fun, the Good Boy Fun thing.  I like that, yeah.  This is amazing.  That's Sully, lead singer of Godsmack, and of course doing a solo thing, did this for  Lil Jimmy Norton.  Sounds good.  See you guys tomorrow.  Later. 
[03:30:30]  Good Boy Fun and your Naughty Boy Fun.  Good Boy Fun is when you're home.  With the old crow. 
[03:31:00]  And your Naughty Boy Fun is when nobody's home.  And that little fucking whore from Canada blows up your phone.  It's your good boy phone and your naughty boy phone.  Your naughty boy phone and your good boy phone.  Your good boy phone and your naughty boy phone.  Naughty boy phone and your good boy phone.  I like the naughty boy phone. 
[03:31:30]  The virus.  Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  That's what it is.  After Opie and Anthony Live, I don't know if everybody heard.  I just got this.  People just started tweeting this in.  I guess news just broke.  Roland's here. 
[03:32:00]  Eric's here.  I just saw Troy walking back.  He's a Pennsylvania guy.  Apparently, Ryan Dunn died.  Did you hear about this, Eric?  No, I didn't hear that at all.  The guy asked Troy.  Is Troy in there with you?  Yeah.  Did you hear?  Did you hear Ryan Dunn died?  No.  No, we just found out, too.  Yeah, this is breaking, I guess.  TMZ is reporting.  Jackass star Ryan Dunn died in a car crash in Pennsylvania early this morning.  Jesus Christ.  Were you trying to make it to Troy's DJ gig? 
[03:32:30]  I don't even know what that means.  Ryan Dunn was the guy from the Jackass movie who, as he cited in this TMZ article, famously  shoving a toy car into his rectum in the first movie in 2002.  Yeah, Jesus Christ.  I guess Ryan Dunn is dead.  Death three.  Why?  Who was the other?  Clarence, Joel Silver, I believe, and then Ryan Dunn.  Who's Joel Silver?  What is that, producer?  Oh.  He died yesterday, so that's three.  You know, we did kind of break the Clarence Clemens news on here last week. 
[03:33:00]  Remember?  It was like, I said he was dead already.  Yeah, so.  Management tried to shut me down, but I broke it.  No, but I guess, well, that sucks.  I mean, I don't even know what to say.  Eric?  His last appearance probably was him and Steve-O on Minute to Win It.  Yeah, he was just on Minute to Win It with Steve-O.  Yeah.  They were doing something for Steve-O's, I guess his sister has a charity or something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was just on, like, the day before Steve-O came in here last week or two weeks 
[03:33:30]  ago.  Ryan Dunn was on Minute to Win It with him.  He's never done the show, has he?  I don't know.  Maybe next time, because we got a group of them last time.  He might have been one of the, yeah, because the big guy, I think it was him, but he didn't  talk to, I believe, there were like four of them he got.  It was a long time ago next time.  I think Brian Novak or whatever his name is came in with Bam.  The Dudesons were in here.  No, but there was, like, the first Jackass movie, there was like four of them came in, 
[03:34:00]  but I'm not sure, I don't remember which four.  Do you remember, Eric?  No, that doesn't sound familiar at all.  Yeah, I don't think Ryan Dunn ever did the show.  Yeah.  Knoxville, obviously, Steve-O.  Baylor and Novak did, not him.  Bam, Novak.  Oh.  Well, I mean, and Roland was just saying it too, it sucks that, like, he went, he spent  his life doing these insane stunts, and then it seems like it was just a regular car accident.  I mean, obviously, we don't have any details yet.  This literally broke during the commercial break, so Brian Dunn is dead from Jackass. 
[03:34:30]  Have you found anything, Eric?  No, I'm looking.  I'm not seeing anything on it.  I don't think he ever did the show.  I can't, I can't, I can't.  No, I don't think so at all.  Yeah, I don't think he did well, and he never will, which is a shame.  I know.  So we'll dedicate this to Ryan Dunn.  Everybody's dying.  How are you dealing with Clarence Clemens?  It's sad.  As a member of the E Street Army.  It's sad, though.  Seeing the big man die.  Is E Street Radio doing some stuff for him? 
[03:35:00]  I think they did it last night.  Dave Marsh did, but I haven't heard anything today.  I haven't listened to E Street Radio today.  I will.  Are you just trying not to?  He was in Lady Gaga's music video, wasn't he?  Was that the last?  The last one was an American Idol perform with Lady Gaga.  And he was just in the video for it that came out, like, last week.  Yeah.  She's a big Bruce fan.  So was that the last performance he did?  Yep.  With Gaga on American Idol.  That's the way his legacy ends.  Oh, my God.  How do you feel about that as a Bruce fan?  Well, if you go back to the last night of the tour. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  Bruce did growing up, but he usually doesn't do a speech, but he did a long speech about Clarence.  How they first met.  Oh, so he kind of knew it was the end?  At least of him touring in the band.  It was weird, though.  Now you watch it, you see him talking about it, because they met in 71.  Mm-hmm.  So, and they talked about it.  30, 40 years.  40 years now.  40 years, yeah.  That's all he did was play an E Street Band for 40 years.  Jesus.  Well, do you think that Bruce knew that was his last time on stage with him? 
[03:36:00]  I don't know.  Like, is that why he was doing this speech?  I don't know.  Because you said he was sitting down.  Obviously, people knew he was sick.  Yeah, they said he was sick on and off, so.  Not that anybody thought he was going to die, but that he was too sick to regularly.  I think maybe this could be, like, the last tour.  The end of the run.  Yeah.  How are you feeling about the, uh...  That's why Bruce said, if you can go see them, go see them now during the tour.  So I went 85 times.  Yeah, I mean, you've seen him before, too.  I said, I will go, Bruce.  And is his nephew now?  Who did you say was?  Jake Clemens. 
[03:36:30]  That's Clemens' nephew?  Do you think he's going to be able to maintain this legacy?  He's really good.  He opened up for the frames when I saw him.  And he was good?  Really good.  But good enough to...  Yeah, it's, like, it's really creepy how you keep playing.  He's really talented.  Because there aren't that many saxophone players.  No, he plays saxophone, drums, and piano.  Jeez, people can't stick to one instrument.  No one is.  Why not perfect that one?  Multi-talented.  There's a lot of stuff going on today, Roland.  People are feedbacking in now saying,  Ryan Dunn is dead.  Car accident.  Yeah.  You've got to listen. 
[03:37:00]  Turn on your radio if you're going to feedback in.  I just said that.  Eric, don't you have any control over this?  Not over the feedback.  That's too bad.  I wish we could turn it off.  Well, I mean, I guess we could just literally click out the window,  and that would be the end of feedback, wouldn't it?  I'm looking through some notes here and stuff.  I guess Don Vito and Ryan Dunn were supposed to be on the show back in September of 2005.  Oh.  But I think Don Vito was missing, so they did a no-show.  Oh, so maybe that's where you confused Roland. 
[03:37:30]  Maybe you booked him, and they just didn't show up.  Bastard.  Well, now you'll never have a chance to make good on that.  Oh, well.  Although Don Vito could still come in.  Vanessa Williams is here.  Yeah.  I just walked by it.  When I was going to the bathroom, I saw her.  What about putting her on the after show?  I'll ask.  You don't think it's going to happen?  Listen.  For her, you probably need a little bit more lead time.  I wanted to.  Yeah.  Another feedbacker says,  Abe Vigoda outlives Ryan Dunn. 
[03:38:00]  How does Abe Vigoda outlive all these people?  He just stays home and does nothing.  That's the trick, huh?  That's the key, yeah.  You're not going to get in a car accident if you don't get in a car.  Yeah.  That's the lesson we learned from Ryan Dunn's life.  Like the country guy, Blake Shelton.  He doesn't drive in L.A.  He refuses to.  What is it with your fascinating...  Roland.  I love Blake Shelton.  Enough with Blake Shelton.  I follow you on Twitter, Rolandos99.  It's RolandOS99.  And all you do is tweet...  I tweet.  ...about Blake Shelton from The Voice. 
[03:38:30]  Yes.  Why?  He's a great singer.  I enjoy him.  That's...  Has he become like your new obsession?  Not obsession.  I just tweet.  A lot about Blake Shelton, though.  The new album comes out July 15th.  Go buy it.  You don't like the other people on The Voice?  I do.  But they're not Blake Shelton.  They're not Blake Shelton.  Are you a country music guy?  I agree.  I was born in Austin.  Yes.  So you're...  I didn't know you were born in Austin.  Yeah.  So you got country music roots.  I've seen tons of country concerts.  You like them? 
[03:39:00]  Yes.  Still to this day?  Yeah.  I saw Tim McGraw, Kenny Chesney, Garth Brooks, Tim McBride.  Where did you see Garth Brooks?  Did you go to the Central Park?  No, no.  I went to Vegas in L.A.  How is he?  In Texas.  They were really good.  He's good live, right?  A lot of hits, that guy.  Tons of hits.  A lot of hits, Garth Brooks.  He's supposed to come back for a few shows.  My parents raised me on country music.  I know a thing or two.  Yeah.  I mean, not, you know, but a thing or two.  Yeah.  Back when New York used to have a country music station.  It's a country that has to be a real country like this. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  Let it go, right?  Yeah.  I just think it's funny that you tweet about Blake Shelton nonstop.  I'm like, what's his connection?  Like, is he trying to get this guy booked on the show?  He's nodding.  We had a...  It was a very interesting Opie and Anthony show today.  Eric, you caught a lot of heat today out of seemingly nowhere.  Surprise.  Do you feel that...  What happened with you?  They call them fat.  Yeah, I know.  Well...  It hurts.  Why today was it...  Did you go back in the barrel out of nowhere? 
[03:40:00]  Because it's easy.  Is that all it was?  They were just looking for the easy out?  It's Sterniola.  I don't think it was...  They were looking for the easy out.  They were going somewhere.  And then, yeah, Steve Sterniola just had to come in and ruin everything.  Okay, so you think this was Sterniola?  Like, they gave Sterniola a mic...  Sterniola.  And he decided...  Sterniola.  And he decided that he was going to take full advantage of the situation and shit on  E-Rock because it was a safe thing to do in the room?  Yes.  You think that is, Roland?  Eric?  I think it was approval of everybody.  What do you think, Eric?  Ah, fuck him.  Who cares?  You don't even give a shit enough. 
[03:40:30]  No.  You don't give a shit enough to have an opinion about him.  No, but I was laughing.  If you scroll down a page or two on the feedback there, I guess somebody flipped over when I  said, why aren't you doing your own show?  And he said he was listening to the other channel and then a bit ended and it was like  dead air for about a minute.  So he's not a good employee.  I guess not.  Well, that is right.  That's called a Sterniola.  That's his mark.  Oh, I see.  But there was a lot...  There ended up being a lot of inside stuff today on the show.  There was, you know, the E-Rock, Troy, Steve Sterniola debacle. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, Troy got vicious, but he doesn't mind getting vicious in there.  There was, you know, a lot of Father's Day talk.  Jess ended up on the phone.  We were talking about special delivery.  So instead, I mean, all the behind the scenes stuff that usually happens on this show happened  on Opie and Anthony today.  So instead, I figured we would celebrate something that happened this day in ONA history.  If you listened to the whole show, you heard a little snippet of it.  And I wanted to play two parts, if we have time for it, because it's also honoring the 
[03:41:30]  memory of someone who is no longer with us.  And that's not Clarence Clemens.  What?  You're playing two clips?  And that's not...  Well, we'll see if I have time for both of them.  Let's be honest.  You scared me for a moment.  Yeah.  That's not Clarence Clemens.  It's not even Ryan Dunn.  As we think about all the people that we've lost recently, our minds always go back to  a legend on the Opie and Anthony show.  Possibly the most valuable member in the on-air history of this program.  Steve is still alive? 
[03:42:00]  No, no, no.  That's obviously not who I'm talking about.  Of course, Roland.  Tippi Tom?  Tippi Tom.  You're exactly right.  The homeless guy...  I mean, Tippi Tom was the type of guy who made it so that management and everybody around  us wanted us to get more homeless people, get more homeless people, get more homeless  people, because nobody understood that Tippi Tom was a one in a million.  It wasn't just that he was homeless.  He was a natural, gifted, born entertainer, and there was nothing more to it than that. 
[03:42:30]  I mean, there was nobody who could just come in here, adapt to any situation, take control  of the room, and be terribly intoxicated and not have a home the way Tippi Tom could.  Well, we had a few beers before he went on.  Yeah, you'd have to give him a few beers.  He would spend some time in the green room drinking before he went on the air, but once  you got that sauce in him, there was no stopping him.  And then I love, after he was done performing, we'd kind of tuck him into the couch in the  back of the studio, and there he would sleep.  Yeah, just let him sleep until Ron and Fez come on. 
[03:43:00]  That was back in the old days of the 57th Street studio, but one year ago today...  Wow.  No, not one year ago.  Three years ago.  2008.  Of course, one year ago today, he was dead still.  But he's dead now.  We found him a couple years ago.  The old man hit his head, and he didn't wake up again.  I mean, that's the life of a homeless guy, man.  It's just one night, you get drunk, and you don't wake up in the morning.  And if it wasn't for this show, nobody would even realize he was gone. 
[03:43:30]  He would just be another nameless corpse in the morgue.  That's life, people.  I hate to depress you, but that's what you're dealing with out there.  Damn, you made me sad.  Unless...  I need more cheese.  You can make a name for yourself the way Tippy Tom did, and your work, your recorded works  can live on throughout history.  Uh, this is just one of those moments, because three years ago today, Tippy Tom was in studio,  as was our pal Dr. Steve of Weird Medicine fame.  Uh, Dr. Steve's Weird Medicine show is on Saturday night, after special delivery, of course. 
[03:44:00]  Um, so Tippy Tom was in, and we gave him a prostate exam.  Um, we cared about the guy's health, and we wanted to make sure he was doing well.  You might have heard a snippet of this earlier on in today's show.  We wanted to play the entire thing for you, because we like you.  We want to share things with you.  And that's what we're doing.  This is Tippy Tom, and the homeless prostate exam, courtesy of our pal Dr. Steve.  And for whoever is feedbacking in now, newsflash Ryan Dunn is dead. 
[03:44:30]  Listen from the beginning of this show.  We've talked about it already.  Yeah?  Uh, Ryan Dunn just died.  I know that!  I know that.  So here it is.  Keith Anderson is sad.  Another guy who has passed away.  Tippy Tom, and the homeless prostate exam, on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Alright, uh...  Alright, Tippy Tom on talk.  Alright, Tippy, yeah.  I'm going to sit down now. 
[03:45:00]  Tippy.  I guess on the...  Why are the doctors putting on all sorts of fucking biohazard gear?  I know.  Do you have a question for me, please?  Hold on, yeah.  When was the last time you saw a doctor, Tippy Tom?  Uh, about a thousand years ago.  When I was growing up.  Yeah.  And then, um...  Yeah, but that was about it.  Yeah.  Um, I'm going to go to doctors that don't like them.  Yeah.  Because they'll find out things that are wrong with you that aren't.  Tom, I've got to ask you something.  So, I'm really not happy with doctors. 
[03:45:30]  Have you been drooling for oil?  I, I...  How much oil do I drink?  No, have you been drooling for oil?  You have fucking hands like Daniel Day-Lewis.  Oh, drooling for oil?  Right.  Oh, I do that all the time.  Yeah.  So, um, what else do you want to hear?  Tippy Tom, the doctor is going to examine you now, so you have to take your clothes off.  Yeah.  Oh, see my body?  Yeah, you got to take your clothes off.  Again, take your clothes off.  Well...  Step out in front of the crowd.  That's going to cost them some money.  Well, step right over here. 
[03:46:00]  That's going to cost...  No, they said no.  No, no, they didn't mean no.  Go ahead.  You want some money?  Come on.  Well, yeah.  No, I'm on our radio.  Right here.  This is the...  Oh, give me money.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the charity portion of the Opie and Anthony show, where  we pass around a basket like we're in church.  What do you want to do?  Give.  Give to the homeless.  Give to the homeless.  Give me my clothes off.  Yeah, be sexy.  Take your clothes off and throw them like a stripper.  Wait a second.  Take it like Ryan and do it. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, it gets crazy.  All right, take your clothes off, Tom, for your...  Tom, for your exam.  Take your clothes off.  Throw your money, ladies and gentlemen.  Throw your money.  I'm not taking all my clothes off.  You got to take it off for your exam.  Get your pants.  Well, where's the doctor at?  He's right there.  Look, that's the doctor.  All right, all right.  Come on, come on.  You just...  All right.  You do this...  What are we doing?  We're standing here.  Dr. Steve's keeping...  Here, here.  Come on.  Dr. Steve's keeping it very professionally.  He said, Tom doesn't have to take all his clothes off.  Get your hog away from me. 
[03:47:00]  How is his penis next day?  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  Jimmy was...  Don't sprinkle them by me, E-Rock.  Jimmy was three feet from Jimmy Tom's penis.  All right, get over here.  Tom, we're going to...  Yeah, I'm getting over here.  Tom, we're going to examine you.  Dr. Steve is a real doctor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tom and I talked before the show.  Yeah.  All right.  And he's cool with doing this on the air.  Am I sitting down or standing up?  We'll let you stand up here.  You got to take your jacket off the time. 
[03:47:30]  Take Anthony's chair away, please.  Take your jacket off the time.  Take your jacket off the time.  Take your jacket off the time.  I'm standing up right now.  All right.  Because I'm going to get an exam.  Yes.  To see if I'm okay.  We've been here for a long time, and we've arranged for someone at the Ryan Center uptown  to see him after the show if we find anything.  Okay.  Yeah, because, you know, my pancreas has given out.  Not your liver?  Let's see.  Something else is breaking down.  And plus, I stubbed my toe.  And that's what bothers me the most. 
[03:48:00]  So, can you fix the toe?  Sure.  Absolutely.  Let's see your feet, Tom.  Yeah, let's see them.  By the way, who's working the pal-talk cameras?  No, let's take the place up.  No one's working the pal-talk cameras.  I got my new socks on.  Yeah.  Yeah, Dad, you know how to do that?  And I have to keep them on.  That's why we're Tommy.  Because my doctor told me.  Because I stubbed my toe.  All right.  Dr. Steve is listening to his heart.  Steve, you got to give us commentary, obviously. 
[03:48:30]  I'm just listening to his heart, and it actually sounds pretty darn good.  You can take us working, huh?  Yep.  Oh!  That's good!  That's good.  Take a deep breath for me.  Take a deep breath.  Oh, boy.  Emphysema for everyone.  Occasually.  Well, I mostly smoke other things.  I'm just going to feel it.  I smoke corn silk.  Corn silk. 
[03:49:00]  How is his lungs?  How is his land in the city?  How is his lungs?  They get in a cornfield in Jersey.  Where do you think you're going to get it at?  All right.  They got it in Long Island, too.  Steve?  Okay.  Now, Tom, you know your liver is a little enlarged.  I think my liver is a little enlarged.  Oh, that's not enough.  Can I see your...  Can I see your...  What you're feeling, Steve, is the help me sign.  The liver's holding up.  Oh, the ankle no good.  Ankle no good. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah, this is where it gets serious.  Well, this one's not too bad.  Oh, Tom.  No, this one's worse.  Yeah, Dr. Steve is looking at...  Well, I got it coming up.  Tippy Tom's ankle.  They're not too bad.  I can still walk.  Yeah.  So, obviously, everything is...  Have they been swollen like that for a long time?  Dr. Steve, you have...  Well, they go up and down, you know.  Yeah.  You know, some days up, some days down.  Dr. Steve, it's been about a year that I've seen it like that.  Yeah.  Well...  Do you get shorter breath when you lay down? 
[03:50:00]  No.  Okay.  All right.  What do you think that means, this ankle?  You have to park that.  When you have big ankles, it can be from a lot of things, but it's always fluid, and  it's just the question is where...  Edemia?  Edema.  Edema, I mean?  Yeah.  Where is the fluid coming from?  Now, in his case...  What this really looks like is a thing called venous stasis, which is just...  It's from gravity pulling on the veins in the legs. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah, gravity!  And then fluid...  I did not know that!  And fluid...  Now I know.  Fluid leaks out from the veins.  And we'll talk about that after the show.  But if you elevate your legs when you're laying down, that'll actually help that.  Yes.  Elevate them.  That's what I do.  Yep.  Oh, good.  Yeah, but I lay on concrete.  It helps my back, too, because I've got a bad back.  Okay.  So I lay on a flat surface and elevate my dukes, my feet, and that way the blood circulation 
[03:51:00]  runs right.  So, because when I wake up, if I go to sleep, if I'm lucky, then I wake up or get up when  I'm getting up, when I'm done laying down, so I can walk.  You spend most of the day on your feet?  Because I like to walk around town!  Yeah!  Now, the thing that I'd like to do next is what we talked about earlier, is to check  your prostate and check your rear end floor. 
[03:51:30]  My prostate, Glenn?  Yep.  Well, that might be a job.  You want to go off my ass?  Yep.  What we'll do is we'll have you drop your drawers, and I'll have you bend over the table,  and we'll bring up a...  Right here?  Yep.  We'll bring up a sheet so that nobody can see you.  So something...  A camera?  No, and I'll just use my finger, and we'll just test you for blood.  And we'll check out your prostate gland.  Check the, uh...  So you'll put the finger up the ass, huh?  Yeah.  Is that okay? 
[03:52:00]  Yeah.  Will you rotate it a little bit?  I want to enjoy this process!  You're doing it for free!  See, I just let the material be funny.  I don't have to try to be funny.  That's fucking great.  Will you rotate a little bit?  I'm going to put a finger up my ass.  I want it to feel good.  And that's the way it is.  All right, let's get the sheet up for...  If it don't feel good, I'll be mad. 
[03:52:30]  You okay with doing this?  Well, when are we going to do this job?  Right now.  Where?  Right here?  Yep.  In front of everybody?  Yep.  They'll bring the sheet up.  Right here?  The sheet's up.  No one can see you, except us.  The finger's going in the ass.  If it's okay with you.  In front of everybody?  There's only a matter of time.  Yeah, just...  Wow.  You were just naked.  We were in front of everybody.  Yeah.  Tom, you bend forward and he checks you.  Yeah, that's all.  It's just squeaky.  Yeah, but suppose they like my ass. 
[03:53:00]  I'm Golden Buns.  And they may like me.  That's why we got to check out.  Because the Golden Buns don't want to...  I have too many people on me.  We're checking out...  And I can only handle a few at a time.  Yeah.  We're checking out Golden Buns for you.  And it'll just be me.  Yeah.  And this is my partner, PA John, who you met before.  Oh, another doctor.  Yes, sir.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good.  I got two doctors.  That's right.  And I'm happy.  You ready?  All right.  How are we going to do this?  You just drop your drawers and bend over the table?  Just kind of touch your ankle. 
[03:53:30]  Just kind of bend over?  You going to do this?  Yeah.  All right.  Everybody, I'm going to get checked out.  Let me see what happens here.  By the way, I got to remind people, Dr. Steve got him a real checkup for later on today.  Dr. Steve is behind.  Come on.  Get this asshole out.  Tom, you want to tell us what's going on?  Ow.  It hurts.  You haven't even started yet.  Yeah, come on, Tom.  All right. 
[03:54:00]  All right.  Let's listen to Tom.  I'm up here now.  Come on, man.  Get ready.  Oh.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  Actually, your prostate is a normal size.  Oh, that's good news.  Anything abnormal on it at all.  And we're checking you for blood right now.  Oh, you got to pull some blood out of me, man. 
[03:54:30]  No, no, no.  We're checking what we got out of your rear end for blood.  Oh, you get it in there?  It's a miracle.  It's a miracle.  Miracles do happen.  Love that.  What do you have to say, Tippi Tom?  What do you think, Tippi Tom?  Well, I'll say I'm very happy that my doctors are here.  Yeah.  And I'm very happy that I got a clear, clean bill of health.  Yeah.  And that's it. 
[03:55:00]  And so what I got to say is that thank you for the medical.  How much is the bill?  After O&A, live.  The only thing good about being Ryan Dunn right now, who we just found out passed away,  is that he gets to hang out with Tippi Tom somewhere.  Yeah.  We can only hope.  I mean, that's where I hope I'm going, right to Tippi Tom's place.  Because we're just going to hang out and just chill.  Tippi Tom, I mean, if you didn't laugh at that, I don't know what's wrong with you.  Roland, you miss Tippi Tom, don't you?  Yeah, he's funny. 
[03:55:30]  That's what I thought.  He made me laugh when he was drinking beers.  He goes, I'm going to get drunk.  That's a very good impression.  And I said one beer.  I go, no, I can't drink.  He goes, you're a pussy.  A whole bunch of stuff was happening today.  They finally got to my DNA test today.  What was the results?  Well, Anthony determined they were inconclusive.  Because it basically just said I was 1% or less of every white race,  and then from every white country,  and then like half a percent Puerto Rican.  So I don't know where any of it comes from. 
[03:56:00]  Wait a minute.  So you and Mars are brothers?  Well, Mars came in here to celebrate when he heard that news, yeah.  Of course, he comes in and celebrates anything.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  As long as he doesn't have to.  Hey, break time!  Hey!  Oh, wow.  So you're saying as long as he doesn't have to work, he'll come in to celebrate.  Or he'll sit on the couch here and go,  you have to wake him up.  Hey, Mars, what's up?  Wow.  You're brutal, Roland.  I don't think I have any Hispanic blood in me whatsoever.  So I think that, yes.  Well, you do.  You're passive and lazy, so you might.  How am I lazy?  I'm just saying. 
[03:56:30]  What does that mean?  That you made it up?  No.  Yes.  I mean, I just think I may stick with Anthony.  And the DNA test, after all this time, was probably inconclusive.  Eric, did you have any opinions on that?  I don't think we examined it thoroughly enough.  The paperwork, or you just don't think the test was done well?  The paperwork for it.  I think they're misreading something.  Why?  Because there was a couple other levels that we never really went through.  Yeah, I don't think any of us really understood the paperwork. 
[03:57:00]  Like, I didn't get it.  Well, that's why you used to call the guy to walk you through.  Yeah, we didn't want to do all that.  Oh.  So, I mean, we just figured we'd figure it out,  and what we figured out was inconclusive.  So to any of you, I saw somebody on Twitter was saying they didn't want to get out of their car  because they wanted to hear the results.  Hopefully it got out of your car because it really was a buzzkill.  I wanted to get shit during that segment.  It had to go so bad.  Yeah, I mean, the shit was probably better because it was more concrete.  It was fantastic.  Actually, I hope not. 
[03:57:30]  I hope there's a little more moisture to it than that.  It was fantastic.  While we still have a little bit of time, let's continue to celebrate the life of Tippy Tom.  You know, we did enough behind the scenes on the regular show today  that we'll celebrate some show content on the after show  and the life of Tippy Tom.  And yes, CokeLogic, I'm reading your feedback.  That cardboard box in the sky.  Roland should be hosting this show.  You suck.  Okay, well, that's a different person feedback.  I love CokeLogic.  CokeLogic didn't feedback the second part. 
[03:58:00]  Well, it doesn't matter.  I still love CokeLogic.  Well, I love CokeLogic too.  But, Tippy Tom, it was the same day.  Actually, this happened before the prostate exam happened.  Ant had left for the day.  He had to catch a flight.  He had to go somewhere.  I don't know.  He took over.  And yeah, Tippy Tom decided that, well, we helped him, I guess.  I hope he was coaxing him and Jim was too.  That since Ant is a bit of a germaphobe,  a good idea would be if Tippy Tom sat in his chair  and touched all his things. 
[03:58:30]  Eric, didn't Ant freak out when an intern was playing with his toys?  Yeah, we've had a couple interns that would pick up the megaphone mostly  and pretend to be Anthony.  So either he destroyed them on the air or we wound up throwing stuff out.  And this was another case of throwing everything out,  even stuff he didn't touch.  So you can only imagine, if he doesn't like an intern touching it,  how he felt about a homeless man like Tippy Tom.  And let me tell you something.  We've had a lot of homeless men up here. 
[03:59:00]  Tippy Tom probably smelled worse than any of them combined.  I mean, there was nobody who smelled as bad  or caused as many smiles as Tippy Tom.  I just got Twitter.  If you want to memorialize Ryan Dunn,  you go see Troy Spin in Pennsylvania this weekend.  That's a terrible plug.  It was bad timing and it didn't even have any details.  I totally forgot it.  Yeah.  Maybe you should think your thoughts through  before you really get to it. 
[03:59:30]  Yeah, I was going to sit back here.  And just enjoy the Tippy Tom?  Yeah.  Yeah, why don't you take a breather, Roland?  You're stressing yourself.  It's okay.  This is Tippy Tom taking over Ant's chair,  as I'm sure many of you have dreamed that you could too,  right here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  We've got a huge crowd here at XM today.  The lovely Brie Olsen has joined the festivity.  She's sitting at the big table here.  We've got Dr. Steve at the table. 
[04:00:00]  We've got Tippy Tom wandering around out there  and bothering people.  Hold on.  That mic's not on.  Why does the mic work sometimes  and then other times it doesn't?  Well, what is it that you're trying to say?  I was just saying hi to you, Tippy.  Oh!  You're saying hello?  Yeah.  Well, hello to you too.  All right.  I got an idea, Tippy.  How you doing?  I got this idea.  It might be a little crazy.  I don't know.  But Anthony had to leave the show early today.  He's going out of the Bahamas with Joe Michelini. 
[04:00:30]  Oh, that's good news.  Why don't you come on in here, Tippy?  Come on in, Tippy.  Come on in.  Tippy.  Tippy, I want you.  This is great news.  I want you to sit.  I want you to sit in Anthony's chair.  Yeah, the big, comfy chair.  Make yourself comfortable, Tippy. 
[04:01:00]  I feel like talking.  Let's hear it for Tippy Tom sitting in Anthony's chair.  Yeah.  There you go.  It's the Tippy.  Tippy, it's the Opie and Tippy Tom show.  Here you go.  There's your mic.  Let's try out some of your clothes. 
[04:01:30]  Yeah, Tippy.  Hey, it's my new song.  Wait, play that whistle for everybody.  Okay, hold on, hold on.  I'm going to get it right.  There you go.  There you go.  Tippy Tom.  Sitting in Anthony's chair.  Why don't you try some of the other stuff out of it?  What do you think of the horn there, Tippy? 
[04:02:00]  I can play anything like you've got.  Yeah.  I'm a musician.  Why don't you try some of the buttons over there?  Just push some of the buttons over there.  What button do you want me to put?  Whatever one you want.  It's you, Tom.  All right.  Don't you do it.  Is that enough?  No, keep going.  I got no one up to the top.  Five.  Hold on, hold on, Tom.  One at a time.  I'm trying to do it.  I'm going to do one at a time. 
[04:02:30]  I'm big, big, big.  Four.  Well, let me tell you something, my grunt, big friend.  As long as I go, I'm up to the top.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, warm, greaseball, kumbas come out of the woodwork.  It's in the hole.  Oh, no.  Where's my prize?  Hey, try the bell there, Tom.  Try the bell.  Well, hold on. 
[04:03:00]  How come Tom doesn't have headphones on?  Oh, Tom, do you want the headphones on?  Give me something to spray.  Tom should put those headphones on.  You don't need spray.  Put the headphones on.  I got to talk to somebody.  All right.  Why don't you put the headphones on?  There you go.  Oh, what's in here?  Yeah, try that.  Try blowing into that.  Yeah, that's funny.  There you go.  Oh, look.  It's Anthony on line three.  Hey, wait, Tom.  Tom.  Take this next call through the bullhorn. 
[04:03:30]  Hey!  Hey, Tom.  I like the bullhorn.  Yeah, give him the bullhorn.  Let's talk.  Here, try the bullhorn out there, Tom.  Well, yeah.  Wait, over there.  Right there.  That's a goddamn good idea.  Right here.  I know that.  What I'm saying is this.  Push the button, Tom.  Here we go.  Yeah, guys.  Push it in and talk.  All right.  Now, what I'm saying is that I like the bullhorn, and I don't see no bullhorns around here. 
[04:04:00]  There's no buffalo over here either.  You know, I'm tired of all this New York City.  Hey, Tom.  No buffalo.  Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.  What?  Focus, focus.  Grab the mic.  Put the bullhorn down.  Now, take the next call for us, okay?  All right.  Who's calling?  No, just go, hi, who's this?  Go ahead.  Say it.  Hi, who's this?  Hi, who's this?  Get that animal out of my house. 
[04:04:30]  No.  The animal's not here now.  I will not.  I will not use any of those things again.  I want everything disinfected.  The entire side of the studio.  And I will not sit in that chair.  I will buy it.  Yes.  You're out of business now, buddy. 
[04:05:00]  You're fired.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What I don't understand is why you ain't playing no rock and roll around here.  I knew this was going to happen, too.  I knew it.  The second I left, I'm like, why haven't they sat him in my seat?  I know these scumbags are going to do that.  He's having a ball over there.  He's touching everything.  Well, yeah.  Tom, don't put your mic.  Your mouth is not far enough.  You have to move your mouth closer to the microphone. 
[04:05:30]  Yeah, you've got to get closer to the mic so he can hear you.  Get closer to the mic, Tom.  He can't hear you.  I got the headphones on.  No, but get closer to him.  I want the mic changed.  His lips are touching it.  Now I know everything I can't use anymore.  The mic, I'm taking the mic off and throwing it in the garbage.  Is your name Mike?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Where you been, Mike?  You might think about getting rid of the chair, too.  He's starting to piss me off, Mike.  He's going to be gone.  Yeah.  What's your time?  If I get pissed off, I turn into the Hulk. 
[04:06:00]  And I swear to God.  Yeah.  I will come after you.  He is turning into the Hulk.  Look at his legs are green.  Well, have fun with Tippi Tom.  I'm going to go to the Bahamas.  Hey, Tom.  And throw away everything in that studio.  Can I go?  You want to go to the Bahamas with me?  Yeah.  Why not?  Wouldn't that be great?  I could just ditch him there and have him swim back.  Yeah. 
[04:06:30]  And you get to enjoy my company.  Hey, Tom.  It's hard to...  It's hard to...  It's hard to...  You have to adjust the Paltor cameras with that handle right there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because I want to...  Nobody can see.  What about that?  Let me spray it on.  No, get rid of that.  He's even touching the scent things.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  Oh, what's this for here?  You get nothing.  You lose. 
[04:07:00]  Good day, sir.  Somehow, his sound effects are very appropriate.  Amen.  That was Rocky Pitcher Horror Show.  Well, have fun with that stinky motherfucker.  I got to go.  Where are you going?  And I knew this was going to happen.  Where are you going?  Where are you going?  Go fuck yourself.  Thank you.  Yeah.  There you go.  There's Anthony on his way to the Bahamas.  That's not nice.  Yeah.  That was very uncalled for. 
[04:07:30]  Yeah, that was very wrong of you to hurt my feelings, man.  I actually feel sorry for Ronnie because Ronnie has to sit in that seat at noon today.  All right, Tippy.  Why don't you go get a beer?  There you go.  Well, yeah, I want to get a beer.  Where's the beer at?  Well, they're going to show you where the beer is.  Tippy Tom sitting in Anthony's seat.  I'm all hooked up here.  Yeah.  All right, get them over there to enjoy a beer.  Take my horn.  Yes.  Take the horn.  Tippy. 
[04:08:00]  Have fun with it.  Oh, I got the beer here, man.  We have to sit over there.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Damn, I was having fun at all.  After O&A Live.  Well, we were having fun listening.  Tippy Tom on After Opie and Anthony Live, our old homeless pal.  And boy, does everybody here miss him.  I mean, Danny misses him more than anyone because, I mean, Danny considered him like a true friend.  But, I mean, we all are somehow trying to get through our lives without Tippy Tom. 
[04:08:30]  Sam, breaking news.  Yeah.  Ryan Dunn has passed away.  I know that, Eric.  You, of all people, should be listening.  And now there's people feedbacking in breaking news.  Tippy Tom is dead.  Look, don't make light of the situation.  Eric, you, of all people, should realize that at the beginning of the show, I mentioned that Ryan Dunn had passed away.  It was just breaking on TMZ and all the other.  There was no way you knew at the beginning of the show.  That was 6 a.m.  It just happened. 
[04:09:00]  The beginning of this show, After Opie and Anthony Live.  Oh, this one.  Yes.  This is a show.  This is a show.  Oh.  And I just found out between the Opie and Anthony and After Opie and Anthony Live commercial break.  That's when it broke.  Oh, boy.  Real quick.  I know.  Hotline.  Breaking news.  Blake Shelton's album comes out July 15th.  I know, Roland.  I know, Eric.  I know Roland's phone number now.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I knew it was him that time.  I heard some even more disturbing news that Ron and Fez are not coming back live at 11 o'clock. 
[04:09:30]  No.  I mean, they may be live later in the day.  I don't know where anybody is.  I don't know if Ron is left on another secret mission that he's not going to talk about.  I believe on Tuesday, tomorrow morning, they'll be back live at 11 a.m.  That's the word.  That's what we're hoping for.  But who knows?  Who knows what secret activities Ron Bennington has up his sleeve?  The only way you're going to find out is to stay tuned, because Ron and Fez are coming up next.
