<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with a dramatic, theatrical intro before diving into crude humor and sexually explicit jokes about their radio ratings and a "WOW contest,"  detailing plans for a large party celebrating the finalists whose pictures would be posted online.  The hosts then launch into a discussion about their recent trip to Buffalo, New York, showcasing their geographical confusion about its location within the state and the potential legal repercussions,  with lawyer Ken K. Stevens having already advised them.  Martini Steve makes a brief appearance, sporting a new smoking jacket, and the hosts speculate on MTV's refusal to play a Disturbed music video.  The conversation shifts to Jim Norton and Colin Quinn's experience at a transvestite singing show, sparking numerous sexually charged jokes and calls from listeners.  The show continues to oscillate between the Buffalo incident and vulgar banter.

The show then delves into a discussion about the attractiveness of pregnant women, followed by a graphic anecdote about witnessing family members' genitalia in awkward situations.  Colin Quinn unexpectedly arrives in the studio, delivering a prepared statement in response to earlier discussions about his visit to a gay club with Jim Norton.  A heated exchange ensues with Rich Voss on the phone regarding a proposed comedy tour, with Voss being criticized for his perceived manipulative tactics.  A call from Kevin Avion, a performer mistakenly referenced earlier, leads to a discussion about transgender terminology, quickly interrupted by a furious call from "Tippi Tom," a gay homeless man, resulting in a chaotic argument.  An update on Stalker Patty, who now has a Midtown Manhattan apartment, is also provided.

A large portion of the show is dedicated to reacting to Charlton Heston's Alzheimer's diagnosis, which fuels numerous offensive jokes, impersonations mimicking his potential speech patterns, and exaggerated forgetfulness.  Colin Quinn is a guest early in this segment, briefly discussing his upcoming haircut, followed by a comedically described appearance of Anthony Berger.  The show continues with the running gag about "retarded Laverne and Shirley" and their gig with Rich Voss.  The hosts discuss the banning of caller "Lady Di," her attempts to get on the air while physically restrained outside the studio, and the ongoing jokes about her appearance.  The interactions with Lady Di and another caller, Marion, are highly combative and insulting.  Further discussion of Jim Norton's perceived selfishness and Martini Steve's elaborate entrances are interspersed.  The segment ends with listener calls reacting to the Charlton Heston bit, more commentary on Lady Diâ€™s ban, and concluding banter from the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  You are listening to O.P.N. Anthony on Philadelphia's number one rock station, 94 W.Y.F.B.  I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid. You're afraid of us. You're afraid of change.  We're not what you think. 
[00:00:30]  I'm going to hang up this phone, and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see.  A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible.  This is the opening of the initial.  Hold my signal. Unleash hell.  Welcome to the bottomless pit of Ignorance.  Here's a clip.  Jesus Christ, this is going to suck.  Is that mango or a papaya? 
[00:01:00]  That'll get our ratings up.  How are we supposed to win in the ratings?  If we can't talk about boo and our pleasure.  Suck it up. Walk it off, dick.  I love Camel Toe.  They're shaving for America.  So ass.  I got to see that ass.  No!  I would definitely be willing to have sex with you if we both already had AIDS.  So ass.  I hope he says it isn't bad.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  notch. 
[00:01:30]  Rude, disgusting self-centered  pieces of trash.  You guys suck.  Blah, blah, blah.  Thank God we get back to the angel.  Okay.  Terrific.  Insert joke here.  The handy's great in a pinch.  Can I just hear that?  Hello.  Hoo-hoo.  Pull your pants down.  Ew.  You've got bad eyes.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Number three, pop up your sister. 
[00:02:00]  You're all burning in hell, damn you.  Alcoholism's great radio.  Opie and Anthony.  Are you not entertained?  Making the First Amendment seem like a bad idea.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's Spidey!  Spidey! 
[00:02:30]  It's your appointment!  Well, let me tell you something, my crunk-mick friend.  Today was yesterday because yesterday was so close.  Like, almost like it was the same day.  He was banging cocktail wings just two at a time.  Hey, everybody, we're all going to get laid.  Marijuana is the bomb. 
[00:03:00]  Hey, buddy, get out of the same way.  I think that I don't like it.  I'm a faggot.  I was a faggot from two years old.  Black bomb out!  Black bomb out!  Black bomb out!  Black bomb out!  Black bomb out!  Take your balls and take it off now!  Now you get the hell out of here!  Now you don't like queers, so what do you say? 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, I knew that one, too.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show! 
[00:04:00]  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  And it's Friday?  Yes!  Feels like Tuesday to us.  Mm-hmm.  Two-day week for the boys.  How about that?  I know, when you started playing the It's Friday thing.  Uh, b-b-b-boys.  Like, wait a minute.  B-b-b-boys.  It is Friday.  You're now working two-day weeks, boys.  Boys, boys. 
[00:04:30]  Why even bother coming back?  Boys.  Haven't played this in a while.  I wanted to hear this, but you can't when the music's playing.  He said, well, you know,  we don't have to freeze his whole body.  We can freeze his head.  Oh.  Who do I hear?  Oh, look at this here.  It's Martini Steve.  Why is Martini Steve already in here? 
[00:05:00]  Hey, Martini Steve.  I completely forgot.  Rick runs into my sitting and goes,  uh, yeah, we got a problem with Ann's computer.  I started walking in here and I caught on right outside the door.  And I was like, crap, I'm already falling into it.  You know how many times we've got you with that already?  Three.  Yeah, exactly.  I know.  All right.  There he goes.  Martini Steve.  Did you see he wanted to turn around and say something?  But his music was already started.  So he had to walk out.  He goes, you can't stop when the music starts. 
[00:05:30]  Like he was just ready to turn around and say something else.  He's like, oh, music started.  Damn it.  I just got to walk out.  Yeah, he missed a lot if you weren't listening yesterday.  Martini Steve.  We have reinvented Steve's character on the show.  Foundry Steve is now Martini Steve.  Steve C.  Foundry Steve.  Now Martini Steve.  And there's a picture of Martini Steve on foundrymusic.com.  Looks a lot like George Clooney.  Very funny, yeah.  Got a little George Clooney in him.  Little George Clooney.  Around the face area somewhere.  Little bit. 
[00:06:00]  Little bit.  He's holding his martini.  It's like if George Clooney banged the dude from Backstreet Boys.  You know, the one that has the weird, like, goatee thing.  Joey Fat one.  I don't know their names.  Oh, is it?  Oh, it's insane.  How do you know, Ben?  I have no clue.  I just knew that it was funny that the one guy's name is Joey Fat one.  Joey Fat one?  And he's the fat one.  Okay.  Joey Fatone.  Couple phone numbers in the New York City area.  877-692-1027.  Outside of New York, 866-277-4WOW. 
[00:06:30]  866-277-4WOW, Anthony.  Okay?  Wow.  Ah, wow contest.  Yeah, we were hard at work.  We figured it out.  And within minutes, or within the hour, let's say, the top 20 girls in the WOW contest will  be posted on opianthony.com.  Yeah.  I don't know if you were listening yesterday.  There was a lot of cheating going on.  Cheating.  Some unscrupulous people.  So we had to look at the results and do all sorts of filtering and this and that, blah, 
[00:07:00]  blah, blah.  But I do believe that the 20 girls that have made it into the finals, their pictures will  be up on opianthony.com within the hour.  I do believe we have the 20 hottest WOW girls.  Yes.  We're finally down to 20.  Yes.  It's been how many years?  Well, we've been running this.  I gotta explain.  We love running bits into the ground.  Don't get us wrong.  Don't get us wrong.  We understand that.  We'll never defend that.  But we're stalling on this one because we want to throw a huge party. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  And we're just waiting for the word for marketing if we can pull this damn thing off.  We want to get the top 10 girls.  We want to get a club or, I don't know, a hall in New York City and have a huge party.  Do it right.  Kind of a road show where we show off the finalists in the WOW contest.  Right.  Get some comedy, some rock and roll, some debauchery in the girls.  It'd be nice, right?  Do it upright.  So we're stalling.  So until we have an answer, those 20 girls are just going to sit there on opiananthony.com. 
[00:08:00]  So look at your favorite girls, maybe for the last time.  Just take a look.  Look at some of them who are still sitting there.  Well, Scott's ready to get rid of all of them except for the 20.  Just knowing they're going to be gone.  The top 20 girls.  Oh, no way.  She's still in.  On opiananthony.com.  What's in the hour?  Joe from San Francisco.  What's up?  Hey, Joe.  Hey.  Oh, boy.  Oi.  Joe.  Yeah, this is not on again. 
[00:08:30]  Joe.  Hello.  Hey.  Hello.  What's up, Joe?  San Francisco's got dead air right now.  Dead air, huh?  Well, according to the ratings, it's not going to make much of a difference.  Oh, I know.  I know.  I'm the only listener, I think.  For some reason, we're just not catching on on that tiny little AM station in San Francisco.  They just connected you.  You just went back on.  Oh, there we go.  Thank you.  We're back on in San Francisco.  Thanks, guys.  For the five people that listened to us.  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  Tiny little AM.  And did you hear what's going on in Sacramento?  What?  I know it's forced people in other cities, but Sacramento got rid of the show before us 
[00:09:00]  on KXOA.  Yeah.  They're now running eight or nine hours of O&A.  Ouch.  They could pick up our show live right now.  Oh, really?  Maybe they should do that.  So we get a little interaction.  Yeah.  So they can get a little interaction going.  How does that work with the time thing?  Well, it's three hours and...  It's 12.08 there.  12.08.  Or 7.  Yeah, but the show on before us is not there. 
[00:09:30]  So you could play this show and then just...  So right now...  Oh, my God.  I hate explaining time travel.  It gets really confusing when we do this whole time travel thing on the show.  It's not time travel, though.  Well, you know what I mean.  Time travel.  Yeah.  When we explain time zones and a syndicated radio show, okay?  Yeah.  So it's 12.08 right now in Sacramento, but see, that show that would be on is not there.  So what is on?  Us.  Right now live.  Yes.  No. 
[00:10:00]  A tape version of us.  Why would they do that?  So it might be yesterday's show now being played right now on KXOA.  Put us on live.  Huh?  They should put us on live.  That's what I'm thinking.  They won't hear this to do until it's too late anyway.  By the time they hear that, they'll be like, ah, that would have been a good idea.  Okay, put us on live.  So if they put us on live and then they could replay the show and mix in new hours, I don't  know.  That's what I'm saying, though.  Right now they're hearing us in Sacramento, but it's a tape show.  Why don't Ron and Fez do middays like they do everywhere? 
[00:10:30]  Can't they just come in and do their shift at night?  Yeah, they could do that.  Like they do here in New York.  Chris was here from Sacramento.  I met him finally.  Very nice dude.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, he left now.  He did?  Yeah.  And the reason you're bringing this up is...  It's Sacramento.  Sacramento.  Yeah.  Do you have a show there?  No, not at all.  You don't have a show there?  I certainly don't.  I just mentioned somebody because I haven't seen it.  Is there a chick?  No.  There's a chick.  I'm trying to book something, but I've got nothing booked yet.  Oh, okay. 
[00:11:00]  You're just softening the beaches, as they say.  I think...  Lobbing some shells over.  A little air support.  Yeah.  I think Kid Chris is a secret code for I have a show coming to Sacramento soon.  No, not at all.  Oh.  All right.  I just met him, so I figured I would report it.  All right.  Let's go to the phones.  Bob, what's going on today?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  B-b-b-b-boys.  Boys.  B-b-boys.  Hey.  Hey, Norton's coming here in a couple weeks.  Oh, and actually in October, and I heard you guys are finally making it to Cleveland. 
[00:11:30]  We're working on things.  Yeah.  We don't have anything set in stone, as they say.  They're not paying your way yet?  No, we don't get paid to go to these cities, you idiot.  No, but they put you up in a hotel.  Kim Monroe can't get her head out of her ass?  We ask for hotels and flights.  That's it.  We don't...  Oh, okay.  We don't go out there to get...  We have...  Ant and I have never gotten paid for doing road shows and stuff.  Dude, I can do a bikini car wash with a bunch of chicks and make the money to get you guys  here.  We do it because it's just a big, huge party, and we all have a lot of fun with it. 
[00:12:00]  And sometimes we get arrested.  Sometimes we break laws.  Well...  It's amazing.  Pete Geeky in the morning, who does mornings here, said that you guys are going to be here  for Norton's show, so buy the ticket.  All right, cool.  Then that's what's going to happen.  I haven't heard anything yet, to be honest with you, Bob.  All right?  Dude, and Rocco sucks, too.  The guy in Cleveland knows that Rocco sucks.  When do the tickets go on sale for Cleveland, Jim?  Tomorrow morning at 10 a.m., and there's only going to be...  I'm only doing one show. 
[00:12:30]  Okay.  Can we mention anything about the Buffalo thing without mentioning it?  Let's not.  Ken Stevens, finally...  Ken K. Stevens, finally explained himself, came into the office today and explained the  situation up there to us in full.  We didn't have all of the facts about what's going on up there.  Let's just say there are pending legal matters...  That they're working out?  That they are working out.  That could include... 
[00:13:00]  Could include some arrests.  Some arrests?  Possibly.  A prosecutor working on things?  As long as we keep it vague, I think Ken will be okay.  That's all.  And we did not know this yesterday.  No, we didn't know that.  And I, being really stupid, forgot that Buffalo is part of New York State.  We thought it was like another, you know, another state.  I thought they'd have to, you know, cross state lines.  You know, name a state that we don't go to often.  Idaho.  Idaho.  Let's say we had the T&A with O&A party in Idaho, of all places, Anthony. 
[00:13:30]  Now we had...  She could use a potato instead of a zucchini.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now we had fun in Idaho.  Mm-hmm.  We went there and we conquered and had a great time.  But the reality is we don't know when we're going to be in Idaho again.  Yeah.  So when you start thinking that you'd have to be back in Idaho for them to do things to you...  If we legally got in trouble in Idaho, where maybe we would be arrested if we went back  to Idaho, is the only way to go back to Idaho.  Right.  So we're thinking Buffalo is kind of in another state. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  We're not going to be back anytime soon, so we're kind of safe.  And then you look just to the right of Buffalo, just past that comma, is NY.  NY.  And that means New York.  And then we realize, oh, but how could they be part of New York if they have, like, their  own sports teams and stuff?  Like, New Yorkers don't root for Buffalo.  Right.  We already have, like, what, three hockey teams?  Yeah.  Officially, we have four hockey teams for the New York area. 
[00:14:30]  We've got the two football teams.  And they have their football team.  And they have their football team.  I'm just thinking they're a whole other state.  Of course they are.  I'm thinking a whole other state.  We have to go back for things to happen.  Ken arrest us.  We're safe.  And Ken actually had to give us a geography lesson today.  He had to tell us he had a big pull-down map and he showed us where Buffalo is and that  it is indeed within the borders of New York State.  Right.  I was speechless.  Yes.  I mean, it is?  I thought it was like South Canada or something. 
[00:15:00]  No?  I wasn't even aware it was part of the United States.  Yeah, you're right.  I thought we were in another country.  I thought it was a state called East Michigan.  Right.  Or something like that.  But no, contained right there in New York is Buffalo.  So your old pals, Opie and Anthony, will not be as brave today as we were yesterday.  Ouch.  They could, you know.  Wee.  This is legal, isn't it?  Boy, we sure hope so.  Be cool.  Be cool.  Be cool. 
[00:15:30]  Shut up.  Shh.  Right there.  Okay.  All right.  He's gone.  Shh.  Be cool next time.  We're cool, man.  They see you.  They got dogs, dude.  There's helicopters, too, I hear.  Oh, my God.  Here they come.  All the way from the state of Buffalo.  I swear I wasn't using my noggin.  I'm like, that's like another state.  We have to go back into that state.  That's kind of like what happened with Steve-O there.  Oh, right. 
[00:16:00]  I don't know.  It's like when I was just in Miami.  Right.  I didn't even know I was in the United States of America.  I bet you had no clue.  It's part of Florida.  I had no idea.  When we finally took off from Miami International Airport, I was like, I can't wait to get back to the U.S. of A.  I bet money that you thought it was Cuba.  I absolutely did.  I was looking for some cigars.  Looking for the Cuban cigars.  Some Cubanos.  It's funny how that stuff could confuse you from time to time.  It does.  It's such different cultures. 
[00:16:30]  They don't speak English in the stores.  I'm like, this can't be America no matter what store I go in.  I can't even ask for a bottle of water or a pack of Rolaids without speaking Spanish.  We're in this Buffalo place and I'm thinking it can't be part of New York because the people are really nice here.  Yeah.  And we're driving up.  It'd be a huge lake.  We're in the woods somewhere.  A beach.  I don't know.  It's not like any of the New York beaches I've ever been to.  It looked more like a lake beach.  Right.  It did.  Big lakes in New York?  I never heard of a big lake in New York. 
[00:17:00]  Well, guess what?  We have two.  Get out of here.  Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.  But that's in Ontario and Erie.  But that's for us to enjoy as well.  See, we're New Yorkers and we can enjoy those two lakes as well.  Isn't that great?  And we can also be arrested.  So, Ixnay on the TNA with ONA.  ONA, hey.  Pate.  In Uffalo Bay.  That's right.  Thank you, Ken, for clearing this up today after we sold ourselves down the river yesterday. 
[00:17:30]  We didn't say anything that might be detrimental to the case that the lawyers are putting together,  did we, yesterday?  Well, there might have been a couple little things.  Ken's like, without getting into any specifics, Ken's like, yeah.  So, when you said, see, the way we work things out legally was we said that this gentleman had no knowledge of this, this, or this.  Yeah, he goes, so, when you went on the air and said he certainly did have knowledge of this, this, and this.  Yeah.  Where did you get your info from? 
[00:18:00]  He didn't like our answer when we said, ah, some dude called us.  Some dude.  I don't know.  When you got on the air and said that this person was in charge and no one told you to stop doing this.  Right.  That gets this person in trouble because he was supposed to be in charge of this, this, this.  Right.  And we're just like, ah.  What?  You guys went to Buffalo?  Uh-oh.  Yeah, we did, Jimmy.  Oh, cool.  You're, you're in there, too. 
[00:18:30]  Stop it.  You are so in this mess, too.  There's no skating out.  But somewhere along the line, we were supposed to be told, told all this before yesterday.  Mm-hmm.  Remember how, see, now there's different factions kind of separating up there.  Different factions, all of which were one big happy family.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  It's called every man for themselves.  It's called duck and cover.  Duck and cover.  Because I remember that day pretty vividly.  I remember that day well. 
[00:19:00]  And you know what?  Everyone, and I mean everyone, got along.  Everyone was having such a good time.  I was shaking hands.  We were.  I was laughing, drinking some beers.  All I know is we were exchanging money and produce.  There was a lot of news.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Wow.  Check that out.  Look at that.  I felt like we should be playing We Are the World while we're at that beach.  Everyone just getting along.  And now it seems 90% of those people that were smiling and shaking hands and waving at us over  were some type of undercover people that were just there to check things out. 
[00:19:30]  They weren't there having the fun we thought they were having.  They were just checking stuff out.  Everyone was having so much fun.  Do you remember everyone that was brought over to meet us?  Yeah.  And I mean everyone involved with this.  Yeah.  Everyone.  The sponsors.  The local authority.  They were brought over.  We were shaking hands.  Oh, it's like it was yesterday.  Hey, how you doing?  Great show.  Thank you so much. 
[00:20:00]  We love being here in Buffalo State.  This is amazing.  Buffalo State.  The people are fantastic.  The cops, amazing.  Everyone.  The people with the venue.  What a fantastic time we're having here in the great state of Buffalo.  What a beautiful day.  Oh, you too.  A little wave across the beach.  Hey.  Hey.  How you enjoying the show?  Are you?  I bet.  Hey, fella.  Can I have one of those?  Hey, look at that.  As long as you're buying.  Can I have one? 
[00:20:30]  Hey, crack a cold one with me.  Come on.  Of course.  Yeah, they brought over the president of Buffalo.  We shook his hand.  Whoever that guy was.  He's the president of Buffalo.  Buffalo, we learned a lot about the state of Buffalo.  Right.  That fine day.  We read the Buffalonian Constitution.  Yeah.  And shook hands with the man that wrote it.  Buffalo Bill.  Everyone was happy. 
[00:21:00]  And then, I don't know what happened.  I was happy that I could use my American dollars in Buffalo State.  Even in Buffalo.  And it didn't seem like.  I was a little confused.  I thought we'd have to use a different currency.  I thought we'd have to transfer and maybe lose some money on it.  Like it was cheaper or something.  But no.  It was a one-to-one ratio.  And I will go this far and say, Anthony, that we did certain things.  Okay.  Thinking it was a different state with different laws and possibly a different country.  I don't know what they get away with in the country of Buffalo. 
[00:21:30]  Opie, after what I saw, I thought it was Thailand we were in.  Because only in Thailand would you see the things that we saw.  And I remember I got a stamp on my passport that said Buffalo.  They stamped it and I left.  They said bonjour when I left.  And I was like, we're in the clear.  We are totally in the clear.  I remember when we crossed back over into American airspace, the whole plane applauded like we had made it out. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  We were all such friends just a few weeks ago.  What happened to Buffalo?  I remember landing back in the United States.  And when we got out the plane, Opie, the first thing he did was he got down and kissed the tarmac.  That was after the cavity search.  Well, they're very strict that they're...  What, I was the only one?  No.  No, the only one that didn't enjoy it.  Remember Jimmy was on that flight. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Oh, man.  But things changed apparently in the weeks after that great event of 5,000 or so people packing the beach for fun.  And now it seems some people aren't as friendly anymore.  I don't know what happened.  The other thing that confused me, I didn't realize you could be in the same state if you're in a different time zone.  Oh, did the time zone change? 
[00:23:00]  I think so.  I think it was something like eight or ten hours difference.  You know, anywhere you see the great northern lights, I don't think of America.  I'm looking at the evening sky and I'm seeing the aurora borealis.  That's right.  I was like, this cannot possibly be America.  There were times driving around the state of Buffalo, I thought I was in Africa.  It was Africa.  I think so. 
[00:23:30]  It was like a safari driving there.  It certainly felt like we were in a hotel in South Africa.  Yes.  Isn't Russell Crowe from the great country of Buffalo, Russell Crowe, great actor?  All kidding aside, though, I go, oh, yeah, it's the same state.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  New York.  Now I know where we're going with this.  So it seems now we're not all one big happy, friendly family. 
[00:24:00]  Everybody that was hugging and kissing and sharing body fluids.  Oh, well.  We'll see how this works out.  That's the lawyer's job.  That's the lawyer's job.  That's what they get paid for.  We keep them in business.  To protect our ass.  That's all.  You should see the additions they're putting on their houses because of us.  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  They smile and shake hands like they were at the Buffalo Beach. 
[00:24:30]  When we meet the lawyers of this company.  On that very day.  At certain functions.  Yeah.  They thank us a lot and tell us about what they're doing to their houses.  Their houses.  Because of you and I.  And they're always working on something.  And having to do with us in this show.  Right.  Always.  There is not a day that goes by that they are not working on something.  And there's going on.  There are days we take those conference calls and they're yelling and screaming.  Oh, yeah.  But when it's these functions going on, they secretly thank us. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, of course.  Because we see them at parties.  Because it's more hours that they charge to the company.  People going away parties or some of the station events at big stadiums.  And we see them backstage.  And they go, hey, hey.  How you doing?  Hey, hey.  I want to thank you.  Right.  Boy, you guys keep it up.  My daughter's going to Harvard because of you guys.  Thank you.  That's great.  This one's going to be in litigation for about five years.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Why is Ken K. Stevens outside the studio? 
[00:25:30]  Ken K. Stevens is out there?  Oh, geez.  All right.  Well, that's the latest on that situation.  Yeah.  Of course, Ken told us not to say a peep today.  Peep.  We felt like we needed to kind of defend ourselves.  And I think we worded it.  And showed everyone where our heads were at.  So, I'm just not, it's not like we were talking specifics.  I'm just trying to show the people, let the people know how friendly everybody was on that day. 
[00:26:00]  Right.  And now how splintered the whole coalition is.  We had a coalition of Gucci.  And now it just, it fell apart.  Our strong coalition.  This is like deja vu for the show.  Yeah.  Stone pony.  Stone pony.  What?  Oh, yeah.  What?  Remember that one in Asbury Park?  Another place we thought was, you know, another country.  And before you knew it, they were pointing their fingers at us again.  We're always the ones they point the finger at. 
[00:26:30]  It was them, I swear.  No.  It was Opie and Anthony.  We had no idea.  It was them.  I didn't show, I saw them.  They shot Cyrus.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I like doing things like that.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  All right.  Why don't we step aside a break and get the show going?  Yeah.  Only 35 cents.  For what? 
[00:27:00]  Once again, sometime this hour, the Top 20 Girls in the WoW contest will be up on Opie and Anthony.com.  We solved all the problems with the contest, okay?  Right.  So you'll be able to check out who made it to the Top 20.  Riffs!  Also, we've got to get to Norton's story with Colin.  Oh, Colin, and you're going to see the trannies.  A lot of people are reminding us.  Keep reminding us, because we'll forget as soon as we go to break here.  And there was one other...  I'll remind you.  Oh, yeah.  I'll remember. 
[00:27:30]  Huge story.  I'll be reminding you of everything all day.  Huge story coming out of Hollywood.  What was I supposed to remind you of?  I seemed to have forgotten.  Damn.  Ooh, I was in Buffalo.  I forgot everything.  I don't even remember being there.  Damn them all to hell.  What?  I wasn't there.  I forgot.  What did I see?  Don't know.  I don't know.  Someone go tell Ken K. Stevens that Opie and Anthony have Alzheimer's. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, we just don't remember what happened.  We don't remember anything.  We can't be arrested if we don't remember.  Right.  We said, a little island off of Guam named Buffalo.  Charlton Heston has Alzheimer's.  Yeah.  We got the clips and lots of commentary on the way.  You guys are mean.  We're shopping on delivery, my friend.  I don't have kids.  I want porno.  I want porno.  I want porno on my TV. 
[00:28:30]  I want violent video games.  I want violence on TV.  I don't want to take it off because you had kids.  All you people with your children make me effing sick.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're psychotic.  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  On 94 W  YMV 
[00:29:00]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show  Disturb the game  There's all that  We checked out the new song from Disturb yesterday  They didn't have any of the yelling and screaming  No 
[00:29:30]  And the  By the way, another reason why MTV sucks  They won't play the new Disturb video  It's too controversial  Controversial?  It's too controversial  What is in it that is too controversial?  Too many white people?  What's in it?  Too many white people  What's too controversial? 
[00:30:00]  I would love to know  Ben, do you know?  Oh, I think I know, hold on  What?  I think I know who knows this  Could it be?  He knows better than I do  He knows everything  Oh, here he comes  Yeah, look at him  He's got  He's got a smoking jacket on now  What are you doing?  What's up with the smoking jacket?  It was sitting in my studio  I guess somebody had it in there previously  You know what the best thing is? 
[00:30:30]  Right before he walks in  I see him turn backwards  And open the door with his back  So he doesn't spill his martini  Like it jiggles a little  And just about bumps the rim of the glass  The martini  Then he just spins right around  The olive  Kind of swirls slowly in the glass  As he stops  Usually when we give someone  A nickname around here  They hate it  And they, you know  But you're going with it  You're kind of working with it  That's good  Oh yeah, look at me smile  Every time that music comes out  He's got a winger smoking jacket on  That's nice  Nice logo in the back there, Steve  Here's a guy that likes his nickname  So you know something about why they're banning 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, it's very Holocaust-ish  Very September 11th-ish  Buildings blowing up  Like it's the singer from Disturbed  Walking down a crowded city street  And there's a huge explosion off in the distance  And there's people burning to a crisp  And buildings falling down  What's bad about that?  I don't personally find anything wrong  Not asking you  Not asking you  Take another sip  Everything's fine  It's the reality of our world these days  Yeah  And if he wants to turn it into 
[00:31:30]  You know, a video art, whatever  If it has something to do with one of his songs  And he wants to put it on there  What was MTV's problem?  That they censor it  I think a lot of the  I like MTV, much music  And a couple other international  Because they're all scared  A bunch of chicks running the networks  What do you expect?  They're all scared  No one knows how to be edgy anymore in entertainment  It is online, though  I think launch.com has it  There's a bunch of followers  There's no leaders out there  That, you know, have the balls to go 
[00:32:00]  You know what?  Alright, this is controversial  But we're going to go with it  Yeah  We're going to go with it  Yeah, we've got to be careful  Let's stand out  Amongst the crowd here  But no, they're all a bunch of pussy followers  That guy's hardcore, man  Israeli  Was in the Israeli army and everything  He knows the deal  And you know what?  He was over there dealing with animals  I hope Disturb doesn't turn around  And then come up with a nice, cute PC video  That would suck even worse  Maybe they'll cube things out  Edit it  They're just the worst 
[00:32:30]  There goes Martini Steve  And now with his winger smoking jacket  There it goes  Wow  Yeah  Martini Steve  Trust me, we know it's annoying as hell  But what else are we going to do?  Isn't it weird?  That time one of the interns actually had to hold the door open  Because he had just lit one of those cigarettes in the long cigarette holder  And he had the martini in the other hand  And he's looking around like, hey, open the door  He's looking around like, whoa, hey  I can't open the door like this  I don't have a third hand  Clay, Bertrand  Yeah, please  Anthony has a great observation here 
[00:33:00]  I do  I wish I could remember it  Yes, you do  I'll help you out  We got the girls down to 20  The top 20  Oh, yeah  The last 20 girls in the WOW contest  Are now up on opandanthony.com  They're up  We took a lot of abuse from the listeners  They're saying, man, you guys have just nothing but pigs  Joining this contest, okay?  Yeah  When you see the top 20 girls all on one nice page  One page  You used to have to sort around and look at those red X's 
[00:33:30]  All over the black and white pictures  Of the girls that were booted out  Look at some of the slobs that still don't deserve to be in the goddamn contest  And we whittled down 100 and how many contestants were there?  43 or so  143 contestants  Now one page  20 girls  Each and every one  Hot  Hot  Some might not be your cup of tea or everything  But you cannot argue that each and every one of these girls  Is hot  Is hot  In their own way  They are hot  So it's a whole page  Now you scroll down  And it's a completely different looking contest 
[00:34:00]  No red X's  Hot girls  Those 20 girls will sit there for a few days  Until we figure out where to go from here  I have one girl I got a problem with  Which one?  In here  But I'm not going to say  But it's the one that you picked  Kind of kept her in  Which one?  I'll pop her up here  Oh yeah yeah yeah  I just think there's too much going on there  Oh yeah  There's  You know  The rest of the  The rest of the vehicle is very lovely  But 
[00:34:30]  The implants  Yeah that part  Are a problem  It's a problem  Looks like they're shrugging  Yeah  Meh  But Rick is saying they're all thoroughbred  All thoroughbreds  Well you know  She's got a great  The rest of her body's fantastic  Right  But look at this  I don't like  A little high up on this end right  Tyler  Yeah  What's up?  Not much  I know why they're not showing the disturb video  Alright  The disturb video?  Yeah 
[00:35:00]  The reason why they're not showing it  Is because the lead singer  He thought it was too morbid  And he decided to re-film it  Well Ben is shaking his head wildly  Saying that's not true  Well that's what I heard  Alright  I think  That's what I heard  Alright  We've got to get the trainee story out  Before we move on here  Not much of a story  Well I just want to know  You  You and  Colin Quinn  At his suggestion  At his suggestion  Went to 
[00:35:30]  See  Trannies  Sing  Guys dressed like women  Yes  Sing  Yes  Now this sounds like the gayest night out  I know it does  That you could have with another man  No I've had gayer experiences with a tranny  Believe me  I've seen one hum  What  Like how  First of all  How did Colin approach you with this?  Hey  You know what  You want to go see some tranny sing?  Hey  We'll go get a show  I don't know 
[00:36:00]  I figured  It'd be fun  We'll go  Trannies  They sing  I don't know  You want to go?  You do  You don't  He had gone the week earlier  Yeah  And came to report that there was a fine show  He went the week earlier  So he's going back  Yes  What's up with Colin Quinn?  What's up with Colin?  I don't know  Occasionally I like a man  So what did you guys see? 
[00:36:30]  It was two trannies  And I have to tell you  I went  I figured it'd be a goof  Of course  They were really good  Good what?  Singers  Singing good?  They weren't hot  So I didn't have the whole  Well maybe if no one I knew was here  They weren't like those trannies that  What were they singing that they were considered good?  We sat through like one and a half shows  They sing like  Don't they sing like  Show tunes?  No  Liza Minnelli and all that crap 
[00:37:00]  No they were really good  They're two of the best voices I've ever heard  What do they sing?  The only one  This is where you bury yourself  Go ahead  What do they sing Jim?  I don't know most of the songs  I know one  I'll tell you  They did a couple Aussie songs  They didn't do any Aussie  No?  The one did a version of  Knights in White Satin  Which was good  Alright  And the other one  Which I really loved  The version of  He  Did of  It's so hard to say  He  Did of  Burning Ring of Fire  By Johnny Cash 
[00:37:30]  I really enjoyed  Burning Ring of Fire  I enjoyed  I'm sure there's another  Burning Ring of Fire  Exactly  In his dance  They got the Burning Ring  The Burning Ring  I enjoyed watching  Knights in White Satin  Howl  Never reaching my end  Howl  What is our howl  Never meaning to sound  They were delightful  Delightful trannies singing  Popular songs of the days of yore 
[00:38:00]  Great  Great voice  I really  It was a place called Bardot  And I don't know them  I'm not  Bardot  Bardot  As in Bridget Bardot  One of the favorite actresses  Of the hang  The whole  Is she?  Of course  It's Barry  It's Barry Bardot  So you saw  A show and a half  We stayed  Because Kyle had a friend  Why would you  He was an old friend  Oh a friend  No it was a female friend  Someone I knew  You sure?  He talked to her  They were just going to hang  Yes I'm positive 
[00:38:30]  Okay I thought maybe  You know  Tranny plays  Yeah but they had wanted to see it  So we got to meet you there  And you know  Yeah  It was uneventful  A lot of  What was the audience like?  All gay men  Right  And me and Kyle  A couple of  Did they do this one?  Little  Abba  Dancing Queen  No  Very popular song now  With Mamma Mia  Such a big hit on Broadway  I did not do this song  Did you go see  Mamma Mia on Broadway

I certainly didn't  That's great y'all  They do  Abba  You can dance  Oh  You can drive  Having the time  Of your life  Sit on my lap  Jimmy  Oh  I think it's a girl  Oh  Look at the closet  Clean  Now  I try to show my diverse  Entertainment interest  I get accused of just being  An Aussie fanatic 
[00:39:30]  You being with trannies  Isn't that odd  You know what  You just out gayed  And I  Yeah  What  Well there's things we admit to  On this show  That puts us in the gay zone  But you just  You out gayed us  With this one  That's not gay  I didn't mean that's gay  I never knew Colin Quinn was gay  He's not gay  What  He's not gay  Anybody could be that  Two men  Go to the tranny club  I know it doesn't look good  On the service  It really doesn't  But it was to enjoy  There was actually  A couple of straight couples  We know you pretty well 
[00:40:00]  What did he say  To get you to go there  You don't do anything  It was more like  He said  I saw this tranny singer  Who was great  And I'm like  This is going to be hilarious  Really  That's all he had to say to me  I didn't have a free girl  So this tranny singer  She's great  You want to go  Yeah man  Sure  I'm easy  You're a fag too  No  Yeah  I got to tell you  It was really good  I don't know  It's probably a set up  By all your friends  They got together  And go  You know what  We need to know  Colin make believe  You really care about 
[00:40:30]  This tranny place  And invite Jim  And see if he goes for it  There were two singers  Yeah  Joey Arias  Was one  I think that's the name  Joey Arias  And my particular favorite  Was Raven O  You remember the name  I certainly do  Raven O  Raven is such a tranny name  Yeah  I don't get it  Yeah  But  Raven O  They were really great singers  I got to  Yeah  Let's go to Trippy  Trippy what's up  Hey what's up guys  Hey 
[00:41:00]  I've been to that place  I was there about five years ago  And  And I had a great time  Oh cool  It's no more gay  Than staring at  Man junk in Miami  You know what  That's an excellent point sir  Thank you very much  Little gayer  Yeah but I mean  When I went there  It wasn't just all gay guys  They had lesbians there  And  They were straight people  I mean it was all a mix  It was predominantly gay men  But there was a couple  Of straight couples  Because they asked  Are there any gay guys here  And they all went  Yeah  Oh there was a good amount  There was a good amount  Did they say  Are there any gay guys here 
[00:41:30]  Yeah yeah yeah  They asked  What's the audience  I thought maybe  There was like a catchphrase  How many of the  Did you raise your hand  Going out  I certainly didn't  Let's just be goofy  Let's be silly  I'm going to raise two hands  Why am I sticking to the seat  They're all good looking people  And I'm standing there  In my black Sabbath t-shirt  Just standing out  Like a little straight  White dress jersey  So you were upset  That the men  Dressed like women  Weren't finding you attractive  No  No no no  What  No  It's not what I'm saying  I thought that's exactly  What you said  It's not what I'm saying  You really are a creep 
[00:42:00]  It's not what I'm saying  Okay  All right  It's just a couple of guys  Did you get any movement  In the front of my trousers  Just did you  No  I didn't  No  No I wasn't turned on  Not attractive in the least  These trainings  Let's go to Willie  Willie what's up  Yo yo  That is the gayest show  I've ever seen  In my entire life  My girlfriend dragged me  Out to that thing  It is horrible  Where was I  Yup 
[00:42:30]  I did enjoy that show  Last night  We went to the other night  Back in 1991  Yeah  Yeah  Back in 91  When it might have been relevant  Hayden what's up  Yo what's up man  I've been to the show  Yeah  Down at Bardo  And there's this one dude  Joey Arias  I think is his name  He looks like Fred Flintstone  But he does  Billie Holiday 
[00:43:00]  Amazing  Billie Holiday  Every gay guy  Loves Billie Holiday  I don't like  Billie Holiday  I don't like Billie Holiday  But it's amazing  He has a dude  That looks like Fred Flintstone  An exception to the rule then  The stuff was great  Yeah it was incredible  But the guy looks like  Fred Flintstone  Pretty much in drag  Fred Flintstone in drag  Hey Bonnie  Hey Bonnie  Hey Bonnie  Bad Fred  Hey Fred  What did you do me  Hey  Hey  Hey  Hey  Hey  And they had a little band

[00:44:00]  Partner  You guys going to be adopting soon  No we're not adopting  I really don't like either of you  He happens to be a very good straight friend of mine  That we just went to do something  Fast forward ten years  This crying Jimmy Norton  By the bedside of an emaciated Colin Quinn  Applying makeup to all of his bruises  On his face and arms  With their little adopted lad  By a little Vietnamese boy bouncing  And I'm like don't do that 
[00:44:30]  Daddy's sick  Thank you Jimmy  You know I love you  Jimmy who's going to be daddy now  Did Colin get any  I got it  I got it  I realized that  Colin get any  At the end of the night  No we all went out to eat afterwards  And then I dropped Colin off at the end  There was nothing  There was no sex  You dropped him off at Colin's end  No I didn't drop it off at Colin's end  Oh oh oh  Did you drop it in the end  My ears  No I didn't drop one off  Barely  Barely here  I really wish he was here  Because I could use the help 
[00:45:00]  It bugs me  It was not a gay thing  No it sounds like a fun night  It doesn't sound gay at all  No  No I think that I would recommend you both go  Oh  Together  No you have girlfriends  Just me and Opie  You're both straight men  You can enjoy it  I think we'd go to a football game  I would too  I didn't give up the Yankees in football  Like no more for me guys  Right  But I just happened to enjoy that  You want to see Jeter  You sure did not  You sure didn't give up on the Yankees  It was a good show

[00:46:00]  Hey  What  What's the harm  Two guys  Men  Go out  Ben and Jim and Colin  Went to the Tranny Bar  And they saw guys dressed like girls  Singing great songs  The only reason they were there  Was because of the music  And not the fact that  They were guys dressed like girls  Oh oh oh oh  Guys dressed like girls

[00:49:30]  That's what I heard  Now that I think about it  Would it have been better  If there were just  No girls there  No it wouldn't have been better  Okay  You know what  It would have been better  Just a bunch of men  Enjoying some music  Were they cramping your style  These women  No they weren't  Just a bunch of men  Were they referred to as  Little bitches  By anybody  No  Ew  They have boobies  Seltzer and enjoyed the show

[01:10:30]  Oh  Oh  Oh  This  Is the  Opie and Anthony  Show  Holy  Oh  This is  Opie and Anthony  On Philadelphia's  Number One  Rock Station  Not E4WYSP  This is 
[01:11:00]  The Opie and Anthony  Show  Colin Quinn  Is in the studio  He ran down  In the studio  I guess  If you're just  Tuning in  Norton  Was giving us  A cute little story  About  Seeing a  Tranny thing  Right  There were  Tranny singers  Yeah  Transvestite singers  And Colin  Had seen them before  And thought it would be fun 
[01:11:30]  To take Jimmy  Yeah  And you enjoyed  Your  Yourself there  Sorry very much  Sounded good  And for some reason  I don't know why  Usually you were taking  A ribbing  About this whole thing  But Colin decided  To show up  I guess he heard  Some of that  In the cab  I think what he heard  Was Anthony  Pretty much calling him  Gay  And I didn't say that  Well I do have a statement  I'd like to read  Alright Colin  Your statement  Over the course  Of his career  And life  A man builds 
[01:12:00]  A reputation  If you will  A name  All he really has  What does a man have  Except his good name  That's what I've done  In my years  On MTV  I've kept any  Covert activities  Covert  Then to come  And here today  To hear my character  Be smirched  As I sit  Next to a  Pakistani driver  Who's giving me  The fish eye  Because even he knew  When I told him  To put it on  Because of Jim Norton  The loose lipped 
[01:12:30]  Ninka poop  My whole career  Now reduced  No one will ever  Think of the happy  Laughs they had  On remote control  They'll just  Think of me  As the sodomite  Boy hunter  Degenerate  Thanks to the  Rumor and innuendo  Of this  So  Wow  I think you  Got a lawsuit  I think  That sounded  Like really  Authentic  Well  I don't think  I have a lawsuit  Because if we  Just leave it  At what we know  I'll be fine  I don't want people 
[01:13:00]  To start uncovering  Old skeletons  Really digging up  The dirt  Laughs  But it was  He said you guys  Had fun  And it was  Entertaining  Oh it was great  How'd you find  The place  Um  How'd I find it  Yeah  Somebody turned  You on to it  I stumbled upon it  Yeah  Accidentally one night  When a  The drugs must be  Really good at S.M.L.  My girlfriend at the time  Fantasia  Yeah  Fantasia  It was entertaining  But not as entertaining 
[01:13:30]  As the rich voice  Comedy tour  Have you heard about that  Oh my god  Oh he is a  Oh no  Yeah  Well Voss is trying  To put together  A comedy tour  Everyone now  Is involved with this  Everyone I know  Is somehow involved  With this  Everyone's walking around  Very uncomfortably  Yeah  And embarrassed  Now  We've got to avoid  Eye contact with Voss  Yeah no I'm sure  It'll be good  It'll be good  Because after last time  We had that fun show  With everybody making fun  Of Norton's dumb tape  Yeah  The uh 
[01:14:00]  Then as we walk out  Voss gets chummy  With me  Even though we've been  At odds for like  15 years in comedy  We only talk  Because we both  Have mutual friends  In comedy  That's the only reason  We even socialize  So you pretty much  Have hated him  For 15 years  But because  There was a little  Repartee  Happening  Yeah  Just before vacation  A couple weeks ago  Voss now thinks  You guys are chummy  Exactly  Well it's all because  He wants to exploit  Whatever little  Credibility I have  For his stupid tour  As well as exploit you guys  So he's come to everybody 
[01:14:30]  With this idea  Popeye'd and salivating  Although I guess  He'd be salivating anyway  So he comes with this idea  For this comedy tour  He wants to do  That involves you  Yes  Involves Jimmy  Uh no  No no  Who else does this  Involves  No there's a whole thing  There's a whole thing  With Jimmy too  He's explaining that  His comedy tour  Won't interfere  With Jim Norton's tour  Oh so now he's not 
[01:15:00]  Stepping on anyone's toes  I never thought it would  I don't think  He's got it all figured out  That's even worse  He showed me a contract  With all sorts of  He's been showing you  Contracts  What  I don't know if it's  A contract  But just  Have my secretary  Type this up  Daddy wants you  To type this  And I guess  The tour would be  The tour's name 
[01:15:30]  Would be  The Comedians of O&A  Something that  Actually Ann and I  Want to do eventually  The Girls of Enron  Yeah exactly  Something like that  Yeah  And it would  It would be  Featuring Rich Voss  And Colin Quinn  And uh  Possibly if Patrice O'Neal  For whatever  Patrice  Was available for  But if it was  Something you guys  Would want to do  Wouldn't you be  The ones to bring it up  And certainly not  Voss  Voss is broke  And he's desperate  That's really what it is 
[01:16:00]  I'm sure it's all  An even split  No even like  Begrudgingly goes  Maybe you'll get  A little extra  You know what  You guys are just  Plain creeps  I always know  You're plain like  Two faced creeps  Colin  Yeah  We booked two dates  Today  Are you still in  I'm out  You're lying  I'm out  Colin you're in  Shut up  I can book to myself  Let me tell you something  You can't draw in your house  By yourself  Okay  You're through  You need us  Now shut up  Okay  Look at us

[01:24:30]  You know  First of all  They put their names on it  Tommy  You didn't say anything  And then you had  Rick Dorfman write up a proposal  One of his assistants  Wrote it up  And he showed it to Opie  So hoping he'd read it to you  Because you probably  Could only read half of it  Oh man  The party of the first part  Who's that  Is that me  You know  Listen  And then every gig  You're going to try  And blow me out 
[01:25:00]  With your dirty act  No I'm not  Patrice  No I'm not  Colin we've got to switch  You know  You're great  But then you're going to  Slander me behind my back  To all the Jersey  One nighter guys  I can see it all now  Shut up  Here's Voss  Talking to Colin  First night of the tour  He was banging  Cocktail waitresses  Two at a time  Oh angry  Oh man  And a man in my position  Can't afford to be made  To look ridiculous  You hear that voice

[01:28:30]  Colin  That's like a weight  Off my back right now  Is it  That we've outed Voss  Has that just been bugging you  It's just been uncomfortable  You know  It's really weird  And I actually think  It's a needy look  It would be very  A great tour  But I know what's going to happen  When I see him now  He's going to go  What they said it was okay  They said it was okay  Everyone's being two-faced  Two-faced  He called Colin two-faced  Two-faced  Two-faced  Two-faced  Two-faced bastard  He's just like the Bowery boys 
[01:29:00]  You're not two-faced  It's got a T and a D in there  I'm shelf employed  Yeah  Let's get some sushi  Wow man  Don't tell them what I'm getting  I almost strangled them for that  What's wrong with you  A French cook  And two retards  And two retards  Don't let them on  These are not power brokers  In the industry  They're just nobodies  Who are bringing you up  For the fun of it  Mom's the word  Mom's the word 
[01:29:30]  Oh man  Keep this on the cutie  Soupy dreck  And he said he was taking a nap  And he just woke up  That means one of his daughters  Had to like shake him  Daddy there's bad-mouthing you  On O&M  I'll get daddy the phone  Dial the number  Go grab daddy the phone 
[01:30:00]  What did they say  Are they being two-faced  Two-faced  Two-faced  Is he also light-skinned  You ass  Alright daddy's gonna be  On the phone a while  Fix yourself a lean cuisine  And a tortilla  Tortillias  Tortillias  He was alive 
[01:30:30]  When Kennedy was shot  And he pronounced  Silent L's  You know how disturbing  That is  Okay  Horror  This Thursday  Filthy horror  Sex for Sam  Three  The Opian Anthony Show  Why does he  This  Is O.B. and Anthony  94  O.B.Y.S.P. 
[01:31:00]  Friday  Friday  Friday  And you're checking out  The O.B. and Anthony Show  In studio  Colin Quinn  Yes  He stopped by  To defend his honor  And he did a good job  Read a statement  And then we had 
[01:31:30]  Rich Voss on the phone  What a lot of  What a lot of fun that is  When Rich calls him  Rumor has it  The retarded Laverne  Shirley are stopping by today  For  That poses a problem  Because  Lady Di  Has been banned  From this radio show  Right  Also we got a letter  From Stalker Patty  Oh yeah  Another person  That has been banned  From this radio show  In her crazy person handwriting  But she writes letters  To keep us all updated  On what she's been up to  She's written a whole letter 
[01:32:00]  About how she has a new place to live  Finally  She's been homeless  Since I believe we got her  Thrown out of her place  Then when we got her  Thrown out of her place  It seems like just yesterday  To her it seems like  It's been about ten years  Of living in shelters  And being raped and robbed  And everything else that could happen  It was our version of  Let's make a deal  And it just  It didn't turn out okay for her  Well we were just looking out for her  Remember when we said that  She was living in a house  And she was living with people 
[01:32:30]  That really didn't like Patty being there  It's almost like a  Colin Voss relationship  You know  They just  They just avoid each other  But it's the status quo  Until someone pulls a bonehead move  Right  Then the gloves come off  Well we thought the family  Wasn't treating Patty very well  And apparently the family  Did not like Patty  They wanted her out  And we made a phone call  To the family  To stick up for Patty  And they said  You know something  Fine  Get her out  And she was out on the street  And that was quite a while ago 
[01:33:00]  And then we proceeded  To rip the wig off her head  And kicked her off the show  We tried to hook her up  In an apartment  And we wound up  Hooking her up  With a guy that confessed  To double murder  Remember that one  Eddie the murderer  Eddie the murderer  I forgot about that  That made the newspapers  And the evening news  And we were interviewing the guy  To make sure it was okay  For Patty to live with this guy  And we were okay with it  We were fine with it  We were just talking to him  About things  And then all of a sudden  During the course of this interview  To make sure he was safe 
[01:33:30]  For Patty to live with  He confessed to a double murder  Dismantling of the bodies  Of a couple of  Columbian drug dealers  So that didn't work out  Too well for her  And she finally now  Has a place  She sent a little  I've moved  A little card  That says  I've moved  Patty  She's an old address  Various people's couches  My suite under the stairs 
[01:34:00]  Because she was living here  At the station  Under the stairs  In the lobby  And various  New York City shelters  And now  She's on  43rd Street  In Midtown Manhattan  How does she get a place?  43rd and what?  I'm not going to give the number  But  God forbid  A stalker stalks a stalker  Yeah  You could look  At the address there  And see  Where  How is she living there? 
[01:34:30]  Not far from me  Hi  Jimmy  It's funny  She's in my building  So she's  She's written us  Welcome back  From your fake suspension  We were on vacation  Yeah  I'm now setting up house  In my humble abode  Of one week  And I'm so grateful  For a home at last  I have so many things  Not to look forward to anymore  Like security checks

Stop it  This conversation ends right now  This is New York City  We don't tolerate any of this  I'm a faggot  I was a faggot  Two years old  Now, you don't like queers?  Is that what you're saying?  You don't die of AIDS  You don't die of AIDS  You don't die of AIDS  You want to interview us  I'm a faggot  I was a faggot  Two years old  You don't die of AIDS 
[01:46:30]  Aw, Tippi Tom ruined our little talk we were having  With Kevin  Oh, man  Kevin's gone?  Isn't that weird?  Tippi Tom  Gay guy  He wears high heels and stuff  But he doesn't want to be known as a tranny  He was outraged  Except he still managed to get in three plugs for his website  I'm hanging up right now  Kevin  I'm outraged  He's going on tour  Him and the boss are going on tour together 
[01:47:00]  Hey, Rick, call him back  We've got to smooth things over  Yeah, we've got to make sure  We got off on the wrong foot there  Tell him it's Tippi Tom  It's Tippi Tom  Just say it's a guy  You know, everyone knows who Tippi Tom is  Explain Tippi Tom to him  And let's get him back on the air  And hopefully Tippi Tom will keep his mouth shut over there  Yeah, Tom  Now, you don't like queers?  Is that what you're saying?  No, Tippi Tom  Of course not  That's not what we were saying  I want to know what he wears  And why he's not a tranny 
[01:47:30]  I don't get it  Because, Opie, there's a whole  Well, the tranny name is bad now?  Yeah, there's a whole thing going on  Why is everybody so sensitive?  Everyone's sensitive  And everyone thinks they're not what they are  Like, you don't want to be a tranny  Oh, I'm not a tranny  I'm just a guy that dresses up like a girl  I never knew that tranny was a bad word for those people  They won't allow high school teams to be named tranny anymore either  Really?  The trannies?  Yeah, they think it's derogatory  Yeah, it could be  I think it might have a point there  Tranny  Yeah, because if you're a tranny 
[01:48:00]  If you're dressing up like a girl  You don't want to be lumped in with all the people that are dressing like girls  Because you're original  You don't tuck  Right, so he says he don't tuck  He doesn't tuck  A little tuck of the schlong  And that makes you a tranny  But he still wears the high heels  Wears a dress, high heels, dances, sings  Well, transvestite is different than transsexual  They're different things  Transsexual is  Well, I believe transsexual is more of a medical thing  That's after you've got it  I don't even  You have to be gay to be a transvestite?  I don't know  A lot of them, I don't know if we're gay or not 
[01:48:30]  From the HBO shows I've seen  They're lesbians  They say no  They're lesbians  They go no  You know, they show them all the time  It's like  Well, I'm a grandfather  I have five grandchildren  I'm a CEO of a major corporation  But on the weekends  I like dressing like a woman  And going out to bars in New York  And they follow them around  And, you know  Did you see the one on HBO?  The transsexual who turns into a man  And then dies of ovarian cancer?  Oh, what a kick in the ass by God there 
[01:49:00]  One of the sickest  You'd think he'd have the ovaries taken out  Documentaries on HBO  I think it was ovarian cancer  They take the ovaries out?  He's got a beard and everything  Well, I got the ovarian cancer  Dresses like a cowboy and stuff  Cowboy  They always grow the beards, right?  They grow the beard  If you have the big beard  Anytime a girl turns into a guy  They all grow that  Look, I'm a man  I got the big beard  But there's no way they could attach  A real schlong down there, huh?  No, well  We're stalling 
[01:49:30]  Because Rick's talking to Kevin  Oh, is he?  Yeah  I hope we can  I just want to hear him talk to Tippi Tom some more  Smooth things up  I wish I had more Tippi Tom clubs  I only have a few  I got some dice ones  See, that doesn't hurt me  That's like a nice thing for you to say  See, maybe I can have dice talk  This is why there's so many problems in the world  Okay, go  We can do some dice  What time is it?  It's 525  Why are you tongue-tied?  Well, I  Tommy  I'm confused  Tony Slangini  What do I care?

It's 525  Everything's going on  You got issues, sweetheart  Why aren't you talking now?
