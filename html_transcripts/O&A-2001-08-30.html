<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a game centered around audio clips from the HBO documentary "King Gimp." Listeners guessed what the King Gimp was saying, choosing from absurd and often offensive multiple-choice answers.  Contestants easily won prizes including concert tickets to various artists (Red Hot Chili Peppers, Foo Fighters, Adam Ferrara, Stephen Lynch, Green Day, Dr. Dre/Snoop Dogg/Ice Cube/Eminem).  One caller criticized the segment as tasteless and heartless, a criticism briefly acknowledged before the game resumed.  This transitioned into a Mike Tyson impersonation laced with profanity and offensive jokes targeting the British Royal Family and others.  This was followed by playing Orson Welles' profane outtakes from a commercial recording session, with further discussion and a brief *Flintstones* reference.

Andrew Dice Clay then appeared as a guest.  The conversation focused on comedian Jay Moore allegedly performing Dice Clay's material, including his "nicey-nice" bit, on another radio show.  Dice Clay, believing Anthony was involved, called in angrily.  This led to a lengthy, chaotic discussion with accusations, denials, wrestling references, a "meek inheriting the earth" joke, a "boogaloo" running gag, and Jay Moore also joining the phone conversation.  The discussion shifted to Opie's new home gym, with callers mocking Opie and Anthony's reactions.  The segment ended with a failed attempt to get an Elvis impersonator to sing in the studio bathroom, due to the running gag about Elvis' death; the impersonator refused, leading to frustration and the playing of the impersonator's CD.

Next, a phone call with Joe Pesci featured his original rap, "Wiseguy."  This transitioned into a discussion about Louie Anderson's comedic style and his upcoming *Family Feud* hosting gig, referencing Ray Combs' tragic fate and jokingly imagining a *Family Feud* episode based on Anderson's childhood abuse.  A significant portion involved a bizarre extended bit on a catfight promotion, including an interview with a Crystal Films representative detailing the rules (no eye-gouging or face-punching) and the ages of participants, including underage teens.  Opie claimed the ability to guess someone's age from their "taint," attempting (and failing) a demonstration on a female guest.  The segment concluded with Arnold Schwarzenegger prank calls and clips of a live catfight outside the studio.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  O.B. and Anthony, it's the kind of show where you can feel up your sister, feel up your sister, feel up your sister.  O.B. and Anthony.  You guys are awesome. It's like, I gotta listen to you. It's like a drug.  Alright, we're talking about King Gimp. We just saw the automatic door scene.  Oh, my God. He's trying to get through an automatic door, and it opens up, but he can't get through it before it closes again. 
[00:00:30]  And he's like up against it and just totally freaking out. His arms and legs are flailing, his head.  Oh. Rob from Jersey. If he couldn't stay in his chair at the Oscars because he was happy, can you imagine what he would look like rubbing one out?  He would be flying around the room with his junk in his hand like a fire hose going full blast with no one holding it.  Yeah, and everyone's talking about the popcorn scene. They're queuing that one up for us, where he eats popcorn off the floor. 
[00:01:00]  But it's time to play the King Gimp game, Ant.  Yeah. Very easy game.  We're going to give you a King Gimp quote.  An actual quote lifted from the tape in King Gimp's own voice.  And he's actually saying something.  Yes.  We were going to have it where you just had to guess what he said.  Yeah.  But it would be impossible.  It would be impossible.  So we will give you multiple choice.  Correct, Anthony.  Sounds like it's easy, doesn't it? 
[00:01:30]  Yes.  And we got some great prizes today.  Can we give all this stuff away?  Anything we got?  No.  The ONA prize bin here?  We got Red Hot Chili Pepper tickets, Anthony, to see the Foo Fighters, July 14th at the PNC Arts Center.  Got tickets to see your buddy Adam Farrar.  Yes.  At the Toyota Comedy Festival.  How about that?  Stephen Lynch tickets for the Toyota Comedy Festival.  Just an ONA prize package, which is basically CDs and stuff.  Warped tour tickets featuring Green Day at Randall's Island.  Suck and Meadow, Saturday, July 15th. 
[00:02:00]  No, we'll keep that one for another time.  And we have some Up and Smoke tickets.  Up and Smoke tour tickets featuring Dr. Dre.  Snoop Doggy Dogg.  Ice Cube and Eminem.

We'll give you the choices, Dan.  Why don't you give him the choices, Dan?  I don't have them with me.  All right, I got them here.  We were supposed to get two copies of this.  That's okay.  Is King Gamp saying, A, sometimes people laugh at me, but a Gamp is who I am?  B, most people think Gamp means someone with a lame walk, but Gamp also means fighting spirit. 
[00:03:30]  Or C, any time I crap myself, I laugh because Mom has to clean it up.  What is King Gamp saying?  Okay, I'm going to take away my C answer.  Okay.  Did they put subtitles underneath that?  That's what they did?  Yeah.  Oh.  Okay.  No, we figured it out.  What, are you kidding?  Yeah.  Oh, God. 
[00:04:00]  Can you give me A and B again real quick?  A, sometimes people laugh at me, but a Gamp is who I am.  Or B, most people think Gamp means someone with a lame walk, but Gamp also means fighting spirit.  Who?  We need an answer, Chris.  B.  B?  So that's your final answer.  Yeah.  We got a winner!  Yeah!  Now, would you like to see if that's indeed what he said?  Yeah, let's listen.  Listen closely. 
[00:04:30]  What did he say?  This says, most people think Gamp means someone with a lame walk, but Gamp also means a fighting spirit.  King Gamp, everyone.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:05:00]  I knew that from the beginning.  I heard some words in there.  You can make out a couple of the words.  Yeah.  Well, congrats.  All right, Chris, you won.  Wow.  You won.  Hold on the line, all right?  All right, cool.  I think he's going to give you a nice prize there.  Thanks.  All right.  Maybe this is very easy.  Yeah, well, line one.  Chris has won the King Gamp game.  We'll move right on to John here.  John, you want to play King Gamp?  Yeah, yeah.  I want to play King Gamp.  All right.  Where are you calling from? 
[00:05:30]  Clifton, New Jersey.  All right.  Very good.  You got to pay attention, okay?  All right.  All right.  Do we get the choices out?  No, we get the clip out first.  Yes, clip first.  All right.  Here's the clip.  Listen closely.  All right.  All right.  What?  What the hell was that?  He said that while putting on a shirt, just to help you out a little bit, okay? 
[00:06:00]  All right.  Did King Gamp say, A, that bitch needs a slap?  B, I think my hip just snapped.  Sorry.  And C, another day of crap.  I think it's C.  C, another day of crap?  Yes.  Bing, bing, bing.  Let me tell you.  What?  These multiple choice questions are ridiculous.  What?  I knew you could go over the top.  I got it right?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's listen again. 
[00:06:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Another day of crap.  Rick, you're making it too easy.  It's like, well, that's all right.  Who cares?  John, you got a prize.  Hold on to the line, all right?  All right.  I got this twice now.  I need one and two or something.  No, which one you got?  You need three and four.  Okay. 
[00:07:00]  I got that now.  And you need all the clips, okay?  Let me see something.  You want to make sure it's a little harder?  It's getting better?  What?  Just shut up, man.  I kind of laughed at the last one.  I think my hip's down.  I'd be willing to bet on GIMP3 that the guy will obviously get this.  All right.  I'll bet 20 bucks right now. 
[00:07:30]  We're not cheap with our prizes.  It's okay.  I mean, you can make it a little harder.  All right, Rick.  Make it a little harder, all right?  A little harder.  All right.  We're easing into the game slowly, Anthony.  Easing slowly.  Hey, James.  Yeah.  You want to play the GIMP?  James, you win.  Do you want to play the King GIMP game?  We have plenty of stuff to give away.  I don't care.  I'll play.  All right.  Where are you calling from?  East Northwood.  Are you enjoying the King GIMP game?  Oh, yeah.  That's all that matters.  Even better watching it. 
[00:08:00]  All right.  We're going to play the clip.  Listen closely.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  All right. 
[00:08:30]  All right.  Okay.  Whoa.  That's actual audio from King GIMP that was on HBO last night.  All right.  Don't worry.  Don't worry.  We'll give you the multiple choice.  You have to figure out what King GIMP is saying.  All right.  Did King GIMP say, A, they wanted to kill me when I was born, but I was bouncing so much  the doctor couldn't catch me, B, they wanted my mother to put me in an institution, but 
[00:09:00]  she would never give me up, or C, did King GIMP say, my father didn't want me, so he moved  to L.A. and married a stripper, B. Of course it's King B. Oh, my God.  I would have bet a thousand bucks that you would have gotten it.  You would have had to have been King GIMP to miss that one. 
[00:09:30]  All right.  Let's play the clip.  Of course, he said, of course, he said they wanted to kill me when I was born, but I was  bouncing so much the doctors couldn't catch me.  That's not what he said, Ed.  He said, they wanted my mother to put me in an institution, but she would never give me  up.  Here it is.  One more touch.  Oh, I heard institution there. 
[00:10:00]  Yes.  Very good.  James, you've got a good ear for this.  Thanks.  The best quote is still to come, though, guys.  I know.  You're kidding.  All right.  We've got a prize for you.  Hold on in the line, okay?  All right.  Thanks.  Stinky and Spaz will take care of you, so hold on.  All right.  Our own King GIMP, Spaz. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, Spaz looks like King GIMP.  If he would grow that beard, dyed black, he is King GIMP.  All right.  We're going to move on to question number four here.  Okay.  Andrew.  Yo, what's up, guys?  You want to play King GIMP?  Hell yeah.  Now, this one's a little tougher.  I've got to give Rick that much.  All right.  This one's tough?  A little tough.  All right, Andrew.  Listen closely.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh, wait.  Hold on.  Sorry.  Like you got to pick.  You're going to play the same one over and over. 
[00:11:00]  I know.  You got it.  All right.  Here's the one you have to listen to.  Here we go.  Here we go. 
[00:11:30]  I have no clue, guys.  Oh, we've got to give you multiple choice.  Yes, Andrew.  Here we go.  Did King Gimp say, A, no one could understand that I was an intelligent person inside of this body?  B, everyone can laugh all they want.  I am smart and have a hot body.  C, nobody understands that I am not crazy.  I am King Gimp. 
[00:12:00]  A.  Wow, another winner.  No one has lost this game yet.  I'm amazed.  You guys could read King Gimp.  We have a lot in common.  You guys speak King Gimp, I would say.  Tim checking in.  Tell Rick he's an a-hole.  Those answers are too easy.  All right, Andrew, hold on the line.  You've got a prize, too, coming to you.  All right, thanks, guys.  Later.  All right, line four.  Andrew has won the King Gimp game, Anthony. 
[00:12:30]  You want to continue?  Yeah, first of all, I've got the new ones.  The new answer's here.  Yeah.  But he hasn't written down which are the real ones.  Right.  But without even hearing the clip, I want to slowly read through it and see if I can guess  which ones Rick wrote.  Okay.  Listen to the clip.  Are you insane?  What?  He's making me laugh today. 
[00:13:00]  I got it.  Okay.  All right.  He's definitely making me laugh.  I'm saying, before you even start, this one.  Let's see.  Yeah.  Okay.  Very good, Anthony.  Debbie, you want to play the King Gimp game?  Yeah.  Where are you calling from?  Merrick.  We might as well just give everyone the prizes that I have.  I know.  All right, Merrick.  All right, listen to the King Gimp quote and tell us what he's saying, okay?  Okay.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go. 
[00:13:30]  S-R-N-S-E-S-E-S-E-S-E-S-E-S-E-S-E-S-E-S-E-S-E-S-E-S-E-S-E-S-E-S-E-S-E-S  What?  And that's not audio of our own spaz tropping Erica.  I was just going to say tropping or something.  That sounds like the week in review. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my.  All right, let's see how good you are at...  I'll be the first person to lose, I'm sure.  Did King Gimp say, A, she is a beautiful girl who I would love to sleep with, but I don't think she likes me that way.  B, she has changed for the better because she isn't as uptight as she used to be.  Or C, this chick is such a hot piece of ass, I would love to TF her, but I'd probably take her eye out. 
[00:14:30]  I'll go with B.  Of course it's B.  God damn, Rick.  Unbelievable.  Are we running out of prizes, Ben?  Are we running out of prizes?  This is good stuff.  Unbelievable.  We're giving out everything.  It took us months to get these prizes, and we're giving them away.  Get to this stupid game.  All right, well, hold back some of the stuff. 
[00:15:00]  I'll only give them like three choices or something, all right?  All right, Debbie, hold on to the line.  I just read six.  What, Ant?  What's wrong?  I thought you were making it tougher, Rick.  Well, the six is a little rougher.  All right.  E.J.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  All right, you ready?  I am ready.  Okay.  Listen to the quote.  One, two, three, four, five, one. 
[00:15:30]  Uh, what?  We're all going on.  I was trying to follow line by line, and I couldn't.  Are any of these right?  Uh, yeah.  All right.  Hey, come on.  Of course.  Oh.  All right, E.J. 
[00:16:00]  Oh.  Don't be the first to lose.  Oh.  Okay.  Let's see what you got for it.  Did King Gimp say, A, sometimes when I'm alone, I cry because I'm not able to be normal, but what can I do?  B, sometimes it does get lonely, but I don't really think about it much.  Or C, someday I will be able to have a family of retards of my own that I can make fun of, too.  We're all going to hell.  Jesus, Rick.  Uh, I'm going to guess B on this one.  You're going to guess B?  Yes.  We have another winner, it looks like. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, fuck.  Now I just want to play to see if we go.  I've got to say, though, A and B were both pretty good answers, though.  Yes.  At least there wasn't dead giveaway, like T-Fing her and poking her eye out.  Yeah, that's great.  The humor of Rick.  We're enjoying the humor of Rick today.  Comedy style of Rick.  Of Rick, our producer.  All right, E.J., hold on the line.  Thanks a lot, guys.  You have won the King Gimp game, too.  Awesome.  Ron playing along at home on the instant feedback.  No, he didn't say conductor.  When do we reach slow spring? 
[00:17:00]  Matt, why don't you have the callers try to guess just one word that the Gimp is saying  without multiple choices?  John from Hoboken.  I love your show.  Listen religiously every day.  But I have to say the King Gimp segment is truly tasteless and not funny.  Making fun of someone because of his medical condition they have no control over is completely heartless.  King Gimp has done an amazing job of leading a rather normal life, rather normal life, given 
[00:17:30]  his severe medical condition.  It's not funny.  Wow.  Anyway, back to the King Gimp game.  Yeah.  One hour.  Come on.  I dare you to turn off the radio.  I think King Gimp's saying Jew down.  That's racist.  Ben Stein.  Vernon, New Jersey.  All right, Ant.  Let's see if we can keep the record alive here.  Six out of six people have won the King Gimp game.  What's easier to understand? 
[00:18:00]  King Gimp or a dice when he calls in?  I think King Gimp makes more sense.  I'm over here now.  Yeah.  All right.  We have the next King Gimp clip, Anthony.  Okay.  Okay.  Oops, I'm sorry.  That's not the King Gimp.  Wait, here we go.  King Gimp, everyone.  Georgia!  That's Georgia! 
[00:18:30]  Come on.  Be serious.  I have it.  Here it is.  You got it, Ed?  Yeah.  Okay.  Come on!  No, I believe I have the next King Gimp quote, Anthony.  Piggaloo, piggaloo, piggaloo, piggaloo, piggaloo, I'm over here now.  You must be mistaken, because I obviously have it over here.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Come in.  All right, Ed.  Stop fooling around.  We got people that want to play the King Gimp game?  Yes.  All right. 
[00:19:00]  Here's the next quote.  Let us know what King Gimp is saying.  Okay, brother.  How did I get in there?  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Come on now.  Have we run out of clips?  I have them.  I have them.  Come on.  Okay.  All right.  Let's go back to the phones and play the King Gimp game.  Okay.  Here's the next quote.  Can we see your stump?  Easy. 
[00:19:30]  Hey, Russ.  What's up, ONA?  What's up?  You having fun listening to the King Gimp game today?  Bro, I almost got in a full call, gracious.  All right.  Cool.  All right.  Don't be the first one to lose the King Gimp game.  Yeah.  On my luck, I probably will.  All right.  Listen closely to the following quote from King Gimp that was on HBO last night.  And you just have to tell us what King Gimp is saying here.  Here it is.  I have to tell you that many humans will come to me. 
[00:20:00]  And I am fucking wicked.  I am ficking bodies.  Son of a king.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yeah.  That's what I was about to say. 
[00:20:30]  Okay.  Horrific.  All right.  Russ, is King Gimp saying, A, I had two people try and take advantage of me,  but I have some friends who said, F that S.  B, I had two professors that wouldn't even speak to me.  I was thinking, F this S.  C, if the two professors tried to use me as a science experiment again,  I was going to bust a cap in their ass, F that S.  Or D, we're adding even more answers to make it a little tougher, Anthony.  If those two professors had their way, I would not have been allowed in school, F that S. 
[00:21:00]  Russ, what did King Gimp say?  I'm going to go with A, guys.  A?  Yeah.  No, you are our first loser, Russ.  King Gimp did not say, I had two people try and take advantage of me,  but I have some friends who said, F that S.  What King Gimp was saying is, I had two professors that wouldn't even speak to me.  I was thinking, F this S. Here it is.  I had two professors that wouldn't even speak to me. 
[00:21:30]  I was thinking, I'm saying, fuck me, bitch.  Wow, we just had a Gimp cursing on our radio show. 
[00:22:00]  I had no idea when we first played that clip.  The only word you can recognize is the S word of that.  Light FM checking in, Anthony.  Hello, we would be interested in hiring King Gimp for our next Light FM commercial  and possibly DJing for us as well.  Instead of a Valerie Smallbone, you could have King Gimp on Light FM.  Let me tell you something.  No talk.  No, you have him talk.  Let me tell you something.  You want ratings.  You hired King Gimp to do a show opposite us.  I would even, we would listen.  Imagine that. 
[00:22:30]  We would blow off our show to listen to that every day.  A talk show?  What?  Or music?  Would he be a music jock?  No, a music jock.  So he talks a couple times now.  All right, Ant, we have one more contestant for King Gimp.  Yeah.  Thank God.  All right.  Ben from Suffering, New York.  I guess John the Dump Guy doesn't know King Gimp-ish either.  No.  Thank God.  Wayne from Tarrytown.  This is not actually King Gimp.  Who is it?  A, Tom Brokenjaw.  B, Spaz.  C, Christopher Reeves.  Or D, Bob Hope. 
[00:23:00]  All right.  Dennis!  Dennis, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  You want to play the King Gimp game?  Of course you do.  Absolutely.  And you've been having fun checking this game out today?  Yeah, I think the Knicks found a new center.  Yeah, all right.  All right, listen to the King Gimp quote and tell us what King Gimp is saying.  Very easy.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go. 
[00:23:30]  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Ooh.  What?  Why are you laughing?  It's very obvious what he said.  What was that?  Was that Spaz and Saludictorian speech?  All right.  Dennis, here we go.  Did King Gimp say, A, everyone loves a person who fights to preserve, but only I am the Gimp? 
[00:24:00]  B, persevere.  I'm sorry.  Everyone loves a person who fights to persevere, but only I am the Gimp.  B, everyone has a handicap, but the way they deal with it is how you win.  C, everyone has a handicap, but only a few are the Gimp.  Or D, everyone has a handicap, but Jesus Christ, I'm really effed up.  This blows.  Someone, please, I've got to get laid. 
[00:24:30]  I've got to say D just for the hell of it.  What the hell, we'll give you a prize, all right?  No, we don't care.  We don't care.  Dennis, you lost, but you won.  All right, cool.  King Gimp said, Everyone has a handicap, but only a few are true Gimps.  All right.  All right.  All right. 
[00:25:00]  You sure that wasn't Patrick Ewing in between the third and fourth quarter the other night?  Well, Dennis, you're a winner, too.  What the hell?  All righty.  All right.  Hold on, Malina.  Thanks for playing the King Gimp game.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  John checking in.  I think King Gimp said, Yo, B, I didn't steal no Coronas.  And the basic premise of Matt is he tells you things you already know. 
[00:25:30]  He's never given you any new information.  Just sitting there with a fox skadoodle, drawn circle some guy's body parts.  He'll tell you things like, If the quarterback, if he throws the ball and a receiver catches it in the end zone,  then that's going to, that right there, that's going to, that's going to, that's going to, that's going to, that's going to,  that's going to, that's going to, that's right, and that's going to be a touchdown. 
[00:26:00]  Wow.  God damn it, that man nailed it.  Nailed it.  Hey, did you ever hear, like, Troy Aitman lost his contact lenses a couple years ago,  and man's like, here's a guy who, when he puts his contacts in, he can see better.  Anything else?  No, sure, now that's at the end.  Here's a guy who, when he runs, he goes faster.  Come on, one more thing.  Here's a guy who, when he eats a lot, he takes a big dump later.  Man's so ridiculous, he can drive a guy to drink it, and that explains Pat Sumrall's problem. 
[00:26:30]  But Sumrall's got a great voice, doesn't he?  He's got a wonderful voice.  He doesn't use it, he just does those phrases.  You know the video game, right?  It's totally relevant or evident in the video.  Here's a guy who, if he practiced more, he used the right word on the first try.  Sumrall's got the great voice, you know?  He can be running, the guy's running down the field, he can paint the picture with the language,  but all he does is, to the 20, to the 25, there's a flag on the plate. 
[00:27:00]  Hey, if the referee, if he throws a flag and he didn't make a mistake right there,  that's going to be a penalty.  Thanks, John.  Wow.  This is my favorite thing about Man, though, that he'll do like 35, 40 million different  things and throw them into a sentence, but it doesn't make sense, and nobody's paying  attention because everybody's drunk by that time.  He's like, there's a guy, and you see him, and then you know, one time, and I saw these  are the guys that when that, sometimes, and then they're, and now you know it, that's 
[00:27:30]  why, and when these are ones, you know, there's a, see that, you can't tell, Michael Irvin  had a crack pipe on his sideline, he's a guy, you know, there's a place for the helpful  hardware man, and then you see there's a rainbow out today, the way a rainbow works,  you got the sun over here, and then there's a cloud over here, and then the rain comes down  at the end of the rainbow, there's a pot of gold and a leprechaun, and he's, do a little  dance, make a little love, get down tonight, and maybe I have some of that crack, and then  Brett Favre, Brett Favre had a dog on his leg, and once you find him, he had a dog, and 
[00:28:00]  bingo was his name, oh, I, we're going to spell that in third grade, he clap, and then  I-N-G-O, if the dog was licking, he's got a rash, if he wants to get rid of it, tough  acting to an actor, he'll get rid of it.  He doesn't even last the whole bit, that's what I'm talking about.  Don't go to CNN for dick jokes, but don't come here for the news.  Live, the Opie and Anthony show.  I like it when this show's dirty.  Breaking the law, breaking the law, breaking the law, breaking the law, breaking the law, 
[00:28:30]  breaking the law, breaking the law, breaking the law, breaking the law.  Okay, listen, I don't know if you've seen the audio yet, but it's all over CNN.  Mike Tyson's over there, is he fighting again this weekend?  Yeah, man, I've lost track of Tyson, I guess he's in England, fighting, trying to get his  boxing career on track again, and the people just thrilled to have him. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  They can't stand him.  They're outside his hotel, just protesting, saying that they should throw Mike Tyson out  of England.  Mostly the women's groups, Anthony.  The women hate him.  The women hate him over there, they don't appreciate what he's done to women over here in our country,  so they feel he doesn't belong in their country.  He was put in prison for rape.  And then there were allegations by his girlfriends and ex-wives about abuse, all kinds of stuff. 
[00:29:30]  He should have to go back to prison for marrying the lady he's with now.  So, on CNN, they got footage of Mike Tyson.  I guess the protesting has gotten so ugly that they had to bring Mike Tyson to a police station  because they're just protesting wherever he goes.  So, he's out this window at the police station with a megaphone trying to talk to the lady 
[00:30:00]  protesters.  That's what you want him to do.  Like, talk to the protesters.  That won't piss him off any more than they already are, right?  Oh, I'm sure.  Hey, you limey bitches.  Any of you limey bitches want to come in here and see who could take a punch like Robin Gibbons?  Come here, you bitches.  I'm going to kick your ass.  Come here, you're the first one.  Look at you, you toothless bitch.  Come here.  Get out of my face. 
[00:30:30]  I punch you.  Come here, you pasty white English whore.  Why are they so angry at me?  Why are they angry?  Because your queen is a twat.  Come here.  Oh, look, look.  It's a queen.  Come here, queen.  Oh, a couple of body clothes.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you can't even take a punch.  You're like Spinks.  You're like Spinks.  I came out of the corner and pounded him.  Now I'm going to bend the queen over her chair and do her in the caboose. 
[00:31:00]  Just like I did to that Miss USA or whatever the hell it was I banged.  I went to prison for that.  I want a man in prison.  Prison.  Why do I sound like the man dog?  I'm going to make you look like Lady Di after I'm done with you.  You're going to be bleeding.  You can rest assured.  Where's Prince Charles?  I'm going to bang you in your big ears. 
[00:31:30]  Come here.  Okay.  Here's a fine lady.  Now I want to talk sense to you.  I have been rehabilitated.  I went to prison.  I'm just trying to get my fighting career back.  And don't look at me like that.  What would I do?  I don't even understand.  I'm like an animal.  It's like the Beatles over there.  They're chasing him around.  Yeah, but they want to kill me.  They don't want like a autograph or nothing. 
[00:32:00]  They want to kill me.  Thank God they're all too much pussies to have guns over here.  Even the police don't have them.  Fuck, here's one of them bobbies.  That big stupid hat.  Look, I'm kicking his ass.  I'm like King Kong.  I'm just running around.  Remember that King Kong movie?  It was in New York and they couldn't do nothing.  That's me in England.  The cops don't have guns so I can run rampant.  Look, I'm beating up the police. 
[00:32:30]  Are they throwing soccer balls at you, Mike?  Yeah, soccer balls.  That's all they got.  Look, I'm like a big guard booth in front of the palace.  And they got them guards with their big fuzzy hats on.  You can't make them change the expression on their face.  Watch this.  See his expression now?  Now look at this.  Look, now it's a bloody expression.  I made a change.  Now I'm going to take that furry hat and stick it in your keister.  And that's only to make room for my giant member. 
[00:33:00]  Well, look, it's Prince William.  Look at that fine young little man.  I'm going to be himself and abuse him.  I love England.  We're the Spice Girls.  I'm going to skewer them like a shish kebab.  I'll get all of them on there at once.  Come here, you whores.  Come here, you limey whores.  You all got bad teeth.  Your teeth, they suck. 
[00:33:30]  You got the scurvy.  I got a cure for that.  Yeah, that's the cure.  You look at it.  You look at it, bitch.  Go ahead.  Yeah, you ain't never seen nothing.  Where's Hugh Grant?  I'm going to do him too.  Come here, whores.  All English whores.  Lady Di was a whore slut, man.  I'm just trying to be popular.  I'm like Mighty Joe Young. 
[00:34:00]  Rum got rampant through the city.  Lady Di was a slut whore.  Going out with a towel head.  Making her country all pissed off at her.  Look at me just smacking down inside me.  Shut up, bitch.  Am I making any headway?  I'm waiting over the people of England?  Well, there's still a little pissed, Iron Mike.  Well, they all stupid. 
[00:34:30]  They got two TV stations that suck.  Yeah, look at my Mighty Mental, you bitch.  They only got two teeth in their whore head.  I went to that, I went to the London Zoo the other day.  Uh-huh.  And they tried to stop me from leaving.  Yeah.  Some about an escapee.  Shut up.  Sam Ferguson is a fat bitch.  I don't care if she's on that Weight Watchers or nothing. 
[00:35:00]  I make her lose weight.  I go, come here.  Come here.  You know why you eat so much?  Because your mouth works.  Yeah, now it don't.  Now you lose some weight.  You fat bitch.  Look, your hair's red.  Now so's your nose.  And now so's your ass.  Oh, look, here's the queen.  Come here, queen.  Right in the face.  Don't dry it up, slut. 
[00:35:30]  You're making Mike Tyson laugh.  Stop it.  Try to stay in character.  I'm standing up with Rick, screwed up my sound effect.  Now I'm going to go climb Big Ben and swat at aircraft.  T'was beauty killed the beast. 
[00:36:00]  Hey, it's Fay Wray.  Take me back to Skull Island.  Nasty as English people.  Got the big, gappy old teeth.  I love the Irish Republican Army.  I'm learning how to make car bombs.  You people suck.  Am I winning them over? 
[00:36:30]  Am I winning them over?  I don't think so, Iron Mike.  I appreciated what the Luftwaffe did.  They won with their aircraft back in World War II.  Look at this.  I'm going to bite off Prince Charles' ears.  That's a hell of a meal.  He's got some big ass ears.  He is an ugly mother.  Here you go.  I bet he's got a little acorn in his pants  because his wife, the whorebag, Lady Di, 
[00:37:00]  was going out with a towel head.  People of England, your Lady Di was a whore.  How am I doing?  You're not doing too well there.  He had a muff like Don King's hair.  You're going to have a heart attack.  I'm getting more flack from you limeys 
[00:37:30]  and Prince Charles is going to take it  in the leather Cheerios.  Miss Sarah Ferguson.  That's a low blow.  Oh.  Iron Mike, everyone. 
[00:38:00]  What?  Let me know if I'm...  Let me know if I'm welcome back  anytime soon.  You guys sucked at the Falkland Islands.  A bunch of little Mexicans kicked your ass.  James Bond's a pussy.  I better get inside. 
[00:38:30]  It's starting to throw stuff at Mike.  That's fine.  Tom, what's up?  All right, listen.  That was hilarious, I got to say.  But about what you said about Princess Diana,  that was pretty bad, don't you think?  Well, she's a whorebag.  The chick was a slut. 
[00:39:00]  Why do you think she was in the backseat  of that car?  That gappy-toothed bitch.  That's for all y'all.  Oh, did he hang up?  He didn't like my commentary?  I hung up on him.  I didn't want anyone wrecking our buzz today.  A lady died?  In the backseat, I heard that  that towel-haired boyfriend of hers member  was in her hand, ripped right off.  Almost like getting a punch from Mike Tyson. 
[00:39:30]  That's what she would look like  if one of my blows...  That's right.  She's screaming from the grave,  that dead bitch.  I heard it was caught in her teeth.  Teeth.  How do you spell teeth?  Don't ask Mike Tyson how to spell.  All right.  Mike, what's going on?  G-E-F-F.  T-E-A-F-F. 
[00:40:00]  Toofs?  How do you spell teeth?  That's for all y'all.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, it's Naked Girls.  Oh, it's Naked Girls.  Turn it up.  Turn it up.  Oh, it's porno.  Oh, it's porno.  It's not good for you. 
[00:40:30]  It's not good for you.  Ha, ha, ha.  Who else gives you porno and comedy at the same time?  A stupid program called the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:41:00]  We've got something kind of interesting here, Anthony. 
[00:41:30]  Yes.  I've got to give Rick the credit for this one.  And he stumbled upon some Orson Welles outtakes.  Yeah.  We all know who Orson Welles is by now.  Orson Welles, a famous actor, of course.  And I think the last few things he did that we remember was,  They shall serve no wine before it's time.  Remember that guy?  Yep.  Big and fat.  And he was always on the Dean Martin roasts.  He had a killer voice.  He did radio, obviously.  War of the Worlds.  War of the Worlds.  That was his biggie.  He, first radio prank, I think, ever. 
[00:42:00]  He got on the air and said that Martians landed.  My God, how stupid were people.  He got on the air and said Martians had landed in New Jersey and were taking over the world.  Or at least Jersey.  There were people that jumped out of their windows.  Oh, yeah.  Citizen Kane, of course.  He did.  Did a UFO take out the mayor?  Do you remember where he said the ship landed?  In Jersey?  Somewhere in Jersey.  Grover's Mill.  Grover's Mill.  Very good.  That's right. 
[00:42:30]  Very good.  There you go.  Well, Rick stumbled upon some Orson Welles outtakes.  Yeah.  This is pretty damn funny.  You'd think Casey was a tool.  Is that Don on the phone?  Hi.  I'm Casey Kasem.  A little dog.  Nate.  God damn.  How the hell am I supposed to come out of an up-tempo number?  Hi.  You know?  Like this.  So here's Orson Welles.  He's trying to do a commercial read, obviously, Anthony.  Everyone's heard our outtakes.  Mm-hmm.  Here's Orson Welles and his outtakes. 
[00:43:00]  Orson Welles.  He just gets very ornery.  Mm-hmm.  And he's talking to the guy in the control room.  That probably makes about four bucks an hour.  Well, back then, probably like 75 cents an hour.  Oh, my God.  Really?  Probably made nothing while Orson Welles is making all that dough, and he's just giving this guy a hard time.  And it was ten times harder because it was all tape and stuff.  No digital workstations to just punch it in, cut, and paste.  Is that the old razor blade trick where you cut out the and paste it together?  Oh, yeah.  That's how they did it back then.  I remember watching you do that, man. 
[00:43:30]  That was like an art.  Hope used to do that at a VAP all the time.  And it's like, oh, how much time left?  20 seconds, and you're still editing tape, cutting out words on tape, and then taping the two ends together.  That's how they used to do it.  It was a pain in the ass.  Yeah.  So when Orson Welles screws up this read, that means they had to start over.  Yep.  Over and over and over.  Can't just hit, you know, delete, and then start over again like they do on the computer work.  Yeah, I'll punch you in.  Yeah, punch you in.  I'll punch you in the face.  Here we go.  Here's Orson Welles and the killer voice.  Nothing is more important than the simple act of getting together. 
[00:44:00]  Could I have just one more take of that?  Why?  I just did it right.  Yeah.  Why the hell are you asking me for another one?  Well, I thought there was a slight dog, and I would just like to be safe.  Jesus.  He did.  I take directions from one person under protest, but from two I don't sit still.  But who the hell are you anyway?  No, I'm the engineer.  This is a lot of s***.  You know this.  You want one more?  Yes. 
[00:44:30]  Wow.  Man.  I got to hear the first part again where he goes, why?  I did it right the first time.  I think he screwed it up, though.  Yeah, he did screw it up.  He slurred a word, right?  Yeah.  Nothing is more important than the simple act of getting together.  Could I have just one more take of that?  Why?  I just did it right.  Why?  I just did it right.  No, you didn't.  You slurred the word.  What is it?  Nothing is more important than the simple act of getting together.  Could I have just one more take of that? 
[00:45:00]  Why?  I just did it right.  Of getting together.  Of getting together.  More people, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, I'm going to admit it.  Did the engineer screw it up or he screw it up?  All right, let's go.  Why?  I did it right.  I did it right.  Martians in Grover's Mill.  What's happening?  Ray guns.  All right, this next one, man.  Does anyone know what he's doing a read for with this one?  I think it's like frozen peas or something.  Frozen peas.  Yeah.  I'm a whore. 
[00:45:30]  Frozen peas.  My bank account's a little low.  He caught the frozen peas and, man, he gets really picky with that.  I'm into my character.  And the thing is, if it sounds a little weird, like you don't know why he's referring to,  well, we're over whatever, like talking about what he's seeing, it's because when they did  these types of commercials, TV commercials, they had to lay the voice after they shot the picture.  Right.  So he could see what he's, he's, you know.  Right.  So they would show the commercial in front of him.  And as he saw it, he would voice it and say the appropriate things in the appropriate place. 
[00:46:00]  Right.  And they wanted the words to match the pictures.  Right.  Yes.  Here's Orson Welles.  Orson Welles.  We know a remote farm in Lincolnshire where Mrs. Buckley lives.  Every July, peas grow there.  Do you really mean that?  Yeah.  So in other words, I'd start half a second later.  Don't you think you really want to say July over the snow?  Isn't that the fun of it?  It's, it, if you can make it almost when that shell disappears, it'll make my... 
[00:46:30]  I think it's so nice that, that you see a snow-covered field and say every July, peas grow there.  We know a remote farm in Lincolnshire where Mrs. Buckley lives.  Every July, peas grow there.  We aren't even in the fields, you see.  Yeah, we are.  We're talking about them growing and she's picked them.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's about the most phony Orson Welles we'll ever get. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  I think he just cracked a joke.  He's trying to match the audio with the video.  He's talking about growing, peas grow there.  And on the screen, she's already picked them, right?  But she's already picked them.  And then flying saucers come to me.  Ray Gunn.  Listen again.  Thank you, God.  We're talking about them growing and she's picked them.  Yeah.  On what?  On July.  I don't understand you then.  When must, what must be over for July?  When we get out of the snowy field. 
[00:47:30]  When I was out, we were onto a can of peas, a big dish of peas when I said in July.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yes, always.  I'm always past that.  Yes.  Yes.  Well, that's about where I say in July.  You emphasize a bit in, in July.  Why?  That doesn't make any sense.  Sorry.  There's no known way of saying an English sentence in which you'll begin a sentence with in and emphasize it.  Get me a jury and show me how you can say in July. 
[00:48:00]  I, um, if he'd go down on you.  That's just it.  Wait, what?  What did he say there?  What was the curse he said?  He said, and I'll go down?  He said, yeah, I'll go down.  Wow.  Get me a jury.  Go back a couple seconds.  In July.  In July.  Get me a jury and show me how you can say in July.  I, um, if he'd go down on you.  That's just idiotic if you'll forgive me if I say so. 
[00:48:30]  That's just stupid.  In July.  I'd love to know how you emphasize in and in July.  What?  Impossible.  Meaningless.  I think all they were thinking about was that they didn't want to.  He isn't thinking.  Well, sir, tell me just to one last one.  Yeah?  It was my fault.  I said in July.  If you believe every July.  You didn't say it.  He said it.  Your friend.  Every July?  No, you don't really mean every July.  But that's a bad copy. 
[00:49:00]  It's in July.  Of course it's every July.  There's too much directing around here.  Norway.  Fish fingers.  Fendus, Norway.  We know a certain fjord in Norway.  Near where the cod gather in great shoals.  They're Janster Stengelands.  Fresh more on the one that shows things.  You roll it around very nicely.  Yeah, roll it around and I have no more time.  I know.  You don't know what I'm up against.  Because it's full of things that are only correct because they're grammatical.  But they're tough on the air. 
[00:49:30]  You see?  This is a very wearying one.  It's unpleasant to read.  Unrewarding.  What a prick, man.  Oh, my God.  What a prick.  Can you imagine being the guy that's got to run that tape?  The poor engineer.  It wasn't well saying that to you?  Yes.  What are you talking about?  You incompetent.  In the fjords.  In my...  Oh, yes.  The fjords.  There are flying saucers.  Little men.  Green men. 
[00:50:00]  Grey gum.  Why don't you say in and emphasize in?  I'll bend you over and butt slam you.  If you could show me, get me a jury, your friend.  Get me a jury.  Get me a jury.  And another scotch.  I was hammered the complete 20 last years of my life.  There's more.  Is that Don on the phone?  Where are those pictures I was supposed to see?  How am I supposed to go into a commercial about peas with flying saucers landing? 
[00:50:30]  What a dick.  Here's some more.  Because Fiendas frees the card at sea and then add a crumb crisp coating.  That's tough, crumb crisp coating.  I say, no, because of the way it's written, you need to break it up because it's not as conversationally written.  What?  Take crumb out.  Good. 
[00:51:00]  Here under protest is beef burgers.  We know a little place in the American far west where Charlie Briggs chops up the finest prairie-fed beef and tastes.  This is a lot of s***.  You know.  You want one more?  Yes.  One more on the one.  You missed the first beef, actually.  Completely.  What do you mean, isn't it?  You're emphasizing prairie-fed.  But you can't emphasize beef.  That's like he's wanting me to emphasize in before it's your line.  Come on, fellas. 
[00:51:30]  You're losing your heads.  I wouldn't direct any living actor like this in Shakespeare.  When you do this, it's impossible.  Oh, so you did six last year.  And by far away, the best.  And I know the reason.  The right reading for this is the one I'm giving it.  Hold on a minute.  I spent 20 times more for you people than any other commercial I've ever made.  You're such pissed.  Now, what is it you want?  Nothing.  In your depths of your ignorance, what is it you want?  Oh, man.  Whatever it is you want, I can't deliver because I just don't see it. 
[00:52:00]  That was absurdity.  I don't know what it was.  You can't remember.  No money is worth it.  Wow, he left.  He walked.  Throws his headphones off.  Gigs off.  He walked.  That's fine.  On the American bomb, the finest beef is chopped up and hacked like I'm going to hack up these engineers.  The depth of your ignorance.  The depth of your ignorance.  Your pests.  Pests. 
[00:52:30]  What a prick.  Really, man.  Hey, Randy, what's going on?  How are you doing?  Yeah, that's quite a vision there in my head, chopping up beef.  Boy, you want to get that across on a commercial, huh?  That's appetizing.  He hacks up the cows.  You know, I'm listening to you guys and I'm going, God, I know this voice.  I know it's Orson Welles, but I know it from something else.  And I'm going, that's the brain on Pinky and the Brain in the cartoon.  Yeah.  That's him.  Yeah, we're getting instant feedbacks from that, too, that says Pinky and the Brain, they did this almost verbatim. 
[00:53:00]  I mean, God, it's exactly the attitude, the voice, everything.  Yeah, they had him in a recording studio doing the same thing.  But it's Orson Welles.  What a prick.  Hey, Ron, what's going on?  Ron, Ron, what's your name?  Ron, are you going to talk or just sit there like a pest?  Perhaps flying saucers came down and green men abducted him.  They have ray guns.  I don't know what to do. 
[00:53:30]  Ron?  Why can't he find better copy?  Say breast and emphasize, get me a jury.  I'll bend you over and screw.  Green peas.  I love that, man.  Green.  Can I hear where he goes, but I did it right the first time.  You did it right.  Get that on again.  Every July.  Nothing is more important than the simple act of getting together. 
[00:54:00]  Could I have just one more take of that?  Why?  I just did it right.  Yeah.  Why?  I just did it right.  All right, we'll hear the whole clip.  Nothing is more important than the simple act of getting together.  Could I have just one more take of that?  Why?  I just did it right.  Yeah.  Why the hell are you asking me for another one?  Well, I thought there was a slight gong, and I would just like to be safe.  Jesus.  I take directions from one person under protest, but from two I don't sit still. 
[00:54:30]  But who the hell are you anyway?  No, I'm the engineer.  That's a lot of s***, you know.  You want one more?  I take direction from one person under protest, or a green alien, taking over a jersey, bringing  green alien peas every July.  Arthur, what's going on?  You know, the funny thing is this drunken buffoon that you're listening to probably made 
[00:55:00]  the greatest American film ever.  Citizen Kane.  Citizen Kane, yeah.  You know, it's incredible how far he can fall.  Yeah, but then, you know, at the end of his career, there he was on the roasts, the Dean  Martin roasts.  Oh, forget about it.  He had a tuxedo the size of circus tents.  Let me tell you.  Hey, what was the movie Orson Welles did, Evil, in the title?  Touch of Evil.  Touch of Evil.  Touch of Evil, yeah.  What an unbelievable movie that was.  It's pronounced evil. 
[00:55:30]  Evil.  Touch of Evil.  I don't know if this guy just drank a lot of wine to numb his brain, but I don't know  how he fell so far.  Yeah, well, there you go.  Well, you get a jury.  You get a jury.  Find out how.  If you find out how I fell so far, I'll give you a Cleveland steamer.  All right, Arthur.  Complete with undigested green peas.  Green peas.  Every July, every July, I look in my toilet and see corn and green peas, sometimes an errant 
[00:56:00]  strand of broccoli, Rob.  After those Saturday nights with Dean Martin, my bowl would look like someone used a salad  shooter in it.  My ass looks like chopped up, well-fed beef.  Wonderful. 
[00:56:30]  But I did it right.  But I did it right.  I'm getting here that all night long.  I'm talking about.  But I did it right.  Pests.  I did it right the first time.  Don't have to take this.  There's the bowl.  Yes, and if we go to the orange groves in this Southern California orange orchard, you'll  see the two of these put together look like my old sack.  Why can't I talk about my sack?  They look like the oranges. 
[00:57:00]  What do you know?  Idaho russet potatoes.  That's what my sack looks like.  Complete with eyes.  Wonderful.  Why does my ass look like Yucca Flats after the blast?  After a weekend with Dean Martin, Gary Lewis, Bing, and some peas. 
[00:57:30]  One day we were all tanked up in Vegas watching Sinatra, and I believed I saw a flying saucer  land and shoot ray guns.  I don't care if this isn't pertinent to the copy.  Wait, look.  I'll scratch my butt crack.  Look.  It looks like Brie.  I'm ripping off playing.  Wonderful.  Disgusting fat horse and wells.  The final years. 
[00:58:00]  I was served no ass cheese before it's time.  God, I've got to take a dump, you insolent, limey bastard.  I will not take direction from you.  I do it under protest.  I've got to take a dump.  Opie, run a knife over my fat body.  It makes me hot.  No, no.  It's not right.  Please.  No, it's okay, man.  God damn.  My dump looked like leftover beef wellington. 
[00:58:30]  With fine chopped beef.  From a cow, I slammed over the head with a sledgehammer to make these fine burgers.  Mr. Wells, what happens?  Appetizing, isn't it?  I rip its throat out with my own teeth.  What happens if I find a jury?  Find a jury, I'll give you the wheelbarrow.  Roll me in flower, look for the wet spot, violate me. 
[00:59:00]  Orson Welles.  Speaking of greens, toss my salad.  Just toss my salad.  Why?  I did it right the first time.  Yes.  Nothing I like than crapping out a heap and helpin' of rice-a-roni.  The San Francisco treat.  Why is it the San Francisco treat?  I thought that was a fag. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, this show is S.  Rock Quarry, I miss my fans.  I miss Holly Rock, the ad-ulation.  Thank you, Rock Quarry.  No, my name is Gus.  Gus Schultz.  Gus Schultz.  I'm a gas station attendant.  You might remember me in my movie, Dr. Jekyll's Hyde. 
[01:00:00]  Or the dancing playboy.  Remember his dance?  Yeah, I remember him doing the dance.  What was his dance?  Oh, it was just so wacky.  His feet are just like flying.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And what was the cowboy one?  Like he had an extra ankle or something.  His legs would twist up.  Like a gunfight at the OK Rock Corral.  Right, something like that.  Pow, pow, pow.  Remember that?  Right.  And he does his death thing scene. 
[01:00:30]  Ah!  And he messes up his hair, so he's a different character.  He rules, man.  Rock Quarry, I miss my fans.  I miss Holly Rock, the ad-ulation.  I'm going back.  I'll tell Fred and Barney who I am.  They'll get a big kick out of it.  And then Fred didn't believe him?  And Rock, like, punched Fred in the face.  Those guys are great.  And Fred picks him up by, like, his pants and the back of his shirt and throws him out of the house. 
[01:01:00]  I am Rock Quarry.  I am, I am Rock Quarry.  And then he hits the ground.  But I am Rock Quarry.  And his manager comes driving by, Rock, Rock, Booby, Baby.  Booby, Baby, right.  Your fans are waiting, Rock.  And while you're on the Flintstone thing, though,  I find this absolutely brilliant.  Anthony can do all the voices on the Flintstones,  but his greatest trick is that he can do the fake Fred Flintstone.  Remember the fake Fred?  After the guy that did his real voice, Alan Reid, died, 
[01:01:30]  they got this other Fred, the fake Fred voice.  You know, it still looked the same because it's a cartoon, the same guy drawing him.  But the voice, like, as a kid, would just screw you up because it sucked.  Sounded nothing like Fred.  Barney would be like,  Hey, Fred, you want to go bowling?  And then the fake Fred would be like,  Okay, Barney.  Like, what?  What?  You.  How good is that?  How good is that?  That isn't Fred.  I'll go tell Wilma, Barney. 
[01:02:00]  What?  What?  What?  Like, it almost sounded like it.  And it's still Barney.  Okay, Fred.  All right, Barney.  Let me get my bowling ball.  What?  What?  That's not Fred.  That sucks.  It sucks.  How good is that, man?  The fake Fred.  The fake Fred.  The fake Fred kills me every time.  Kills me.  You need to get out and mingle with people, Ant.  No, I love cartoons.  No, not at all.  I love cartoons.  I like the fact that Ant's a recluse. 
[01:02:30]  Trust me.  I stay in my house all day and all night.  Waiting for the Ruck Quarry episode.  Which is my favorite Flintstones episode.  Oh.  Oh.  All right, listen.  Ah.  Now let's turn on the PA system and start the fun.  The O.P. and Anthony show.  Afternoon radio.  This is it.  You can't go anywhere else.  Nowhere to go.  That's like saying you don't like Earth.  You're leaving.  Where are you going?  O.P. and Anthony. 
[01:03:00]  And we finally have control.  Yes.  Gets better every day, don't it?  Oh, God.  We didn't need this today.  Let her rip.  Oh, no.  We didn't need this.  Andrew Dice Clay.  What is going on?  We didn't need this today.  What do I got to deal with over here?  Why do I got to get cold?  I'm riding the bike in Venice. 
[01:03:30]  I'm at the gym.  I'm doing all the errands.  The show.  All I keep getting is calling Club Soda Kenny with this Jay Moore.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What is he doing my material?  Now, I've told this guy.  I guess what was that?  Jay Moore has less material.  So he's got to change his name to Jay Less.  Jay Zero.  I'm the king.  That is that.  And hear that Anthony's on another radio show doing my material with Moore. 
[01:04:00]  Me?  No, no.  Anthony wasn't on another show.  Why would I be on another radio station, Dice?  I worked here.  What do you mean?  I wasn't on another show.  I don't want to say.  Do you mention other shows?  Yeah, go ahead.  Goodbye, Johnny.  This morning, you and Jay Moore.  I was on Goodbye, Johnny.  Get your facts straight, Dice.  I mean, you know.  You know.  I don't think my company would like it.  You do the one thing, and then you go and do the other thing there. 
[01:04:30]  Dice.  I don't think my company would like it if I was on another program that isn't even.  What were you doing there?  Who was there?  No, nobody from this show.  I believe Jay was on Goomba John's show.  What's he doing?  Who is he?  Jay Dice Moore now.  Well, he was doing your nicey-nice on the morning show.  You don't do my nicey-nice because I'm over here, and when I go over there,  there's going to be a problem.  I'm the nicest guy in the world.  You know, I only carry a sledgehammer when people get me aggravated. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, the listeners are helping us out.  It looks like Jay Moore was doing nicey-nice on another radio show this morning.  And what was Anthony doing?  Agging him on.  No, no, no, no.  I wasn't there.  O&A had nothing to do with this one, Dice.  What's that?  I wasn't there as much as you weren't on a bike or at the gym.  And now, boogaloo, and now.  Boogaloo, and now.  Boogaloo, and now.  I got stuck for a minute. 
[01:05:30]  Hey, Dice.  O&A?  Dice.  You mean Q&A?  No, it's Jay Moore.  Q&A was a movie, my friend.  All right, listen.  Jay Moore on the phone also.  Dice, I told you.  Now, all right, let's discuss this like human beings.  Okay, Dice, I think I could.  Dice, let me.  E-E-A-N.  Dice, let me open up with this real fast.  Wait, who's this?  It's Jay Moore.  What are you still doing in New York?  I got a show.  I told you to get out of there.  No, you didn't.  I didn't?  No, you didn't.  Oh, look at that.  We got off to a bass star right away. 
[01:06:00]  Listen.  I don't know what that is.  Not less than five minutes ago, I said Dice was the king of comedy.  We can replay the tapes.  It was during commercials.  We can replay the tapes.  What's wrong with your voice?  I'm horrid.  I did three shows, and then I went to wrestling with Opie, and I lost my voice screaming like  an idiot.  Ha ha.  So you weren't here with Opie.  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm trying to drive around all day.  I'm with the kids, you know, showing them how the meek will inherit the earth. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, yeah?  Dice, Dice, I can explain.  I was over here.  Jay was over there.  How do you like that they say that?  Jay was over there.  I was over here.  What about Jay?  What is with that?  I don't know.  Jay was over there.  Everybody run the meek will inherit the earth.  What's that supposed to mean?  People checking in says, my effing girlfriend whines less than Dice.  What does that mean?  It means you're whining.  No, I'm talking about the meek will inherit the earth. 
[01:07:00]  I don't know.  Dice, you brought it up.  Well, I was talking to Norton last night.  Jay, you know Norton.  Yeah, funny Norton.  You mean Norton?  Yeah.  So he goes, how can the meek inherit the earth?  So what, is the gardener going to all of a sudden become president?  What?  Now you're stealing other comics material?  No, no, Norton was saying this was conversation.  This was an intellectual conversation.  We had about four in the morning.  And then what did you do?  They said, easy, easy. 
[01:07:30]  So you're not talking about the thing.  Why'd you say nicey nice, Jay?  In tribute.  Someone had a sign at WWF last night.  You said nicey nice or nicey nice, dicey dice.  Scoop to me, I'm over here, because everybody said no.  No, I didn't say dice.  I said nicey nice.  What did you say exactly?  All right, dicey.  If you'll let me talk, I'll tell you exactly what I said.  Yeah.  Who's stopping you from talking?  You were talking pretty good this morning.  With my whole midget bit.  Very good, dice. 
[01:08:00]  Very good.  Are the midgets going to inherit the earth?  What are they talking about with the meek?  They don't even make cards for midgets.  That's why they came out with them little scooters with the motors on them.  So they could get around town, these little idiots.  What does that mean?  Where did Jay go?  Why didn't you say it to me?  Why do I got to get a call?  I'm the motor to meet who inherit the earth.  What is wrong with my opening act here? 
[01:08:30]  And he says he's your good friend, Jay.  Is that true?  Yeah, we're very good friends.  What's so good about him?  He's a nice guy.  What?  Does he call you when he's sad and blue?  What's his favorite color?  Not an allergy.  Does he call you when he's down and out?  When he's feeling elation?  Does he call you after he sees like a movie and go,  Jay, I had to talk to you.  You're my best friend.  I want you to feel this with me.  No.  So what makes you such good friends? 
[01:09:00]  See, people throw that word around too much.  Guys, I want your opinion on the presidential,  vice presidential candidate, Joe Liebman, who is Jewish.  Do you think he should make believe he's Italian too?  What does that mean?  I'd like to know who's making believe they're Italian these days.  Other than Jay Moore on the Gumby show,  on the Johnny show.  Doing nicey-nice.  Yeah, you don't do nicey-nice.  That's mine.  He did nicey-nice.  I thought I was doing it as a tribute. 
[01:09:30]  You don't see me doing walking everywhere I go going,  uh, that babes.  I've been working on it.  Nice.  I'll never say it again if you don't want me to say it again.  I said it as a tribute.  I wasn't standing.  No, but if you say it as a tribute,  that's one thing.  How else would I say it?  And he called me up and said,  you and Anthony were on it.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  And I'm sorry for boogaloo-goo-goo-goo-goo-goo-goo-goo-goo-goo-goo-goo-goo-goo-goo-goo-goo-goo.  We've been claiming that face-down ass up is your album.  Dice, we were playing the boogaloo-goo-goo-goo-goo-goo-goo-goo game at the wrestling match last night. 
[01:10:00]  What do you mean?  We were chanting it.  We chant it and see if anyone yells them over here now.  I want everybody's number.  And there was a nicey-nice sign at the WWF event last night.  Hey, Jay.  Yes, sir.  Jay, do you hear how they are now?  What?  You're turning on me?  Oh, no.  Do you hear how they are?  You're turning on me.  You're turning on me.  I mean, Anthony, you're listening to them right now?  Yeah, I know what you mean.  They're up down, they're winding down, like they're done for the day.  Their job is over.  That's how they act. 
[01:10:30]  Well, that's how they get when there's 20 minutes left in the show.  There were people on the freeways.  There were people that had to get up 6 in the morning to go to work, work for that Chinaman board.  And had to stay in there all day with the little slant going,  I told you not to do it, you know, with the letter L thing.  And now, you know, they're done.  They're done with the people for the day.  I'm hearing you, Jay.  We're the same.  Yeah, at least halfway through our show, we don't go,  I'm dying over here. 
[01:11:00]  I got to leave the staging.  What are you talking about?  I got to go.  I'm having a heart attack.  I never said that, my friend.  That's what I heard.  Who said it?  Who said to you?  No, who said what to who to you?  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  You just said that.  Oh, wait a while, Jay Morton.  The guy over there said that.  I was at the show.  I said the other thing with that?  Yeah, with the other nicey nice thing.  I'm having a heart attack.  This is you now.  Look what I'm doing to you now.  No, you're you.  I'm him.  See that?  That's you.  No, you're you. 
[01:11:30]  I'm him.  No, you're you.  And they're them.  And I'm him.  And now I said this.  Okay.  So answer me when I said that.  Now I got it.  So what are you talking about?  I'm dying.  I never said that.  I said I needed orange juice.  No, you didn't.  Yeah.  They carried you out of the club.  It was at the laugh back.  Nobody carried me out.  I was there, guys.  I stood there with my wife.  To try to knock the dice men down.  I'm like the friggin' Fonzie of comedy.  Who's going to kick my butt? 
[01:12:00]  He's doing real good now.  It ain't going to be the pig farmer, that's for sure.  I've been supporting you, Doug.  What do you mean, support me?  You're going on shows saying you're Jay Dice Moon now.  Oh, I did say that.  You're right.  Where'd you do the shows?  I want to know.  I was at a...  We'll play at low-key today because they got 20 minutes.  They got a lot of plans when they leave the station now.  Hey, no, no, no.  Why are you turning on us?  Who's turning on you?  What do we do to you?  Wait a minute.  I didn't say anything about you.  I'm telling you that he...  Where are you going tonight?  That's what I said. 
[01:12:30]  That he was doing the nicey-nice on another show.  Toby, you got the wrong idea of what I said.  I was defending you over here.  Do me a favor, my friend.  I find my own battles.  Okay.  Okay?  I hear you.  How come Opie never talks when I call in?  That is Opie.  That was me doing you.  Anthony, where are you when I need you?  Guys, I'm going to make an appointment for you to get a cat's name.  Anthony, now that you're not married, let me ask you something.  Here we go.  How do you not married?  Like, when you leave the station now, what do you, like, hang out in front of the building 
[01:13:00]  and wait for some board to come by?  You know what I mean?  Pull on your banana a little.  That's it, Dice.  You got it now.  That's fun.  I'm over here now.  It's not like pinching your helmet, huh?  Staying in a New York street.  That's what I used to love about the subways.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  In the morning when I go from, like, Brooklyn to, like, Manhattan.  Right.  I wait for the most crowded train so I can just pinch my helmet all the way into the city.  I didn't even have a job.  After the job was done, I'd take another train home. 
[01:13:30]  I'd go back to sleep.  The day started.  That's what I would do.  Very good, Dice.  You got to pinch your helmet.  Now, that's funny.  That's all guys do all day.  That's all we care about.  Pinching helmets.  Look at a pretty girl.  Pinch your helmet.  See an ugly girl.  Pinch your helmet.  See a fat girl.  Pinch your helmet.  As long as it walks.  Pinch your helmet.  As long as it walks.  Hey, Jay's going to use that tomorrow on, uh...  Oh, no, Jay.  No, he won't.  I don't do anything.  I do no, Dice, whatsoever.  It's going to be on Scott Shannon tomorrow saying, 
[01:14:00]  Pinch your helmet.  I've got to pinch your helmet, Dice.  I've got to pinch my helmet.  It's all about helmet pinching these days.  Hey, so Dice...  Because you know what it is?  Girls get very offended when you actually take it out.  You're trying.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  What are we supposed to do?  If you're actually taking it out on the street, it's like, ah, it's harassment all of a sudden.  Yeah, well...  You're not doing nothing, you know?  You know what I mean?  Oh, I hear you.  Like the other day, I'm pinching my helmet, and this girl sitting next to me says, 
[01:14:30]  Do you really think the bus is the proper place for that?  They said, if you're so concerned, cover it up with your yapper.  Isn't that...  A thousand jokes, stupid.  What do you mean, rework?  I don't rework.  What are you getting tired?  No, I just...  I recognize that scene.  You seem to rework myself pretty good every day of the week or year long.  Dice, I'm with you. 
[01:15:00]  I'm with Dice.  That wasn't a good one.  Na-na-na.  Na-na-na.  Na.  Na-na-na.  Na-na-na.  All right, let's do a boogaloo chant for the audience.  You ready?  All right.  Can we do it together?  That's nice.  Do you know how it goes?  Is that stealing?  Because this is going to be the single.  You guys are going to be getting it soon.  When?  Okay.  When we get that?  Very soon.  The album comes out like in five weeks.  All right.  All right, so it's boogaloo-loogaloo, boogaloo-loogaloo, boogaloo-loogaloo.  I'm over here now. 
[01:15:30]  Okay?  Okay.  All right, we have to do it four times.  I count it off.  All right.  I'm the leader.  Here we go.  Okay.  Okay.  One, two, three, four.  Boogaloo-loogaloo, boogaloo-loogaloo, boogaloo-loogaloo.  I'm over here now.  Where are you?  Oh, we're over here.  Are you alone?  We're over here.  We set you up.  You just set nothing up.  I set myself up for that.  All right, one more time.  We didn't know when we came in.  No, no, no.  You had your chance. 
[01:16:00]  This is the problem with you guys.  Nice.  One more time, because we didn't know.  I didn't know to come in during or after.  You went through the roof on me, you think I'm going to fall for the second time?  I'm not stupid.  Nice.  We want a tape of us all doing it, but we didn't know if we came in while you were doing it  or after you did it.  I thought you wanted us to do the, you know, I'm over here now.  We did the whole thing together.  Together.  All right.  Right from the start.  Okay.  You ready?  Yeah.  I had.  All right.  You want me to count it?  One, two, three.  No, no.  It's one, two, three, four.  Then we come in.  All right.  Here we go.  Are you going to tape it? 
[01:16:30]  I'm rolling tape.  All right.  So we got to do it four times.  Four times.  Here we go.  Okay.  One, two, three, four.  Boogaloo.  See?  I pulled you now.  No, you didn't.  We got you.  No, I only did it the one time.  I wanted to see if you was there.  We got you.  You know we got you.  Come on.  You didn't get me.  Come on.  You totally got you.  We didn't get you.  You nailed something.  No, no.  If I would have went through on it.  No, you both got you.  You bought it.  Come on. 
[01:17:00]  You don't fall for nothing.  You got to give us that one, Dice.  You got to give us that one.  Dice, you look like such a fool.  I gave you a second chance.  Always give somebody a second chance.  All right, Dice.  Let's all do it together.  All right.  Let's all do it together now.  I think we got off on a bad...  We got off to a bad side.  All right.  Wait a minute.  That's my line, my friend.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'll pay you for it.  That's my line.  No, I heard that on Goomba Johnny this morning.  You said you're everybody and I'm nobody.  Is that what you just said?  I heard that on Goomba Johnny today.  I thought I was stealing his line.  Yeah, I'm everybody and you're nobody.  So you decide what it's going to be. 
[01:17:30]  We got you, man.  I'm going to have to find a different MC for the garden.  Come on.  The olive garden.  The olive garden.  I thought we were doing nicey-nice, though.  No, we're not doing nicey-nice.  Twice as nice.  Dicey-nice.  Wait for me.  I'm over here because everybody said nothing.  No, I'm playing the garden.  The magic garden.  The kids show.  All right.  Are we ending with the boogaloo or what? 
[01:18:00]  All right.  You ready?  Well, we got...  I'll count it off.  Wait.  We got more people.  Get everyone around.  Get everyone in the studio.  There's only six people in here.  Get more...  There's seven.  Get Spaz in here.  Everyone in.  Come on, Spaz.  We got like one, two...  How would you know how many people?  You just said seven.  You're not even there.  No, we got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  Nine people.  I'm watching on the internet.  Nine people.  All right.  You ready?  Yes.  Ready.  All right.  I'll count it off.  You better do it.  All right.  Hey, hey.  Jay.  Yes.  I want you to do it as walking. 
[01:18:30]  Oh.  Boogaloo.  Boogaloo.  Do a practice one.  I'm over here now.  No, no.  The whole thing.  No.  Do the whole thing.  No.  Oh, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo.  You know, I'm over here now as walking.  Let me hear it one time.  But that's what walking would say.  You would say no.  Make me.  I don't want to do it.  Now, don't just say anything.  Say what I'm telling you to say.  But say.  Come on.  Try it one time. 
[01:19:00]  No.  Do it.  No.  You can't.  Oh, now we've got to get tough.  Now I've got to beg for the walking.  Last few times I did it, you made fun of me.  Sorry, man.  I did it was fantastic.  Only once.  Shame on you.  What are you going to do it a thousand times?  You're like, you totally ragged him, man.  No, he just goes too long with it.  Yeah, so that time I kept it short and you're telling me to go longer.  No, just do the bit.  Do the boogaloo.  All right.  He'll do it when we all do it.  No, but I've got to hear that. 
[01:19:30]  He can do it at that tempo.  Wow.  Fosse?  Come on.  We've got nine guys in here.  You ready?  We've got nine freaking guys in here.  All right.  Here we go.  Ready?  Ready?  Count off.  One, two, three, four.  I knew you were great.  You could have had a great boogaloo chance.  You blew it.  And now this is what I do.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Nice.  Nice.  That's fine. 
[01:20:00]  That's one of the funniest.  Hey, Club Soda Kenny, I thought you were my friend and now you're getting all your facts  wrong.  Don't worry, Miller.  Just mess with you.  That was so funny.  I was like, do the walking again.  Do it.  Do it.  No.  You know what he's doing.  He's trying to rope you in again.  Standing up to your father.  Jay, now it's over.  I'll tell you.  I called up Club Soda Kenny.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  I said, we need dice on the show today because Jay was doing his stuff on it.  You ratted.  You ratted Jay out to Club Soda Kenny?  I'll be honest.  Sure.  You prick.  It was fun though, man.  And what did I do? 
[01:20:30]  I said, nice.  See, nice.  Nice.  See, nice.  Because I said, nice stickers right in front of me at another radio station.  She sounded disappointed when we didn't do the whole boogaloo.  That's awesome.  God damn, that dice is hysterical.  All right.  I'm looking for toilet training books.  Everybody poops is still the standard, of course.  We've also got the less popular nobody poops but you.  See, what can't we?  No way.  Oh, then you want your anomaly child and that concentrated evil coming out the back of you.  The Opiate Anthony Show. 
[01:21:00]  I need to go pooping.  Back with the Opiate Anthony Show.  Yes.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, are you two tools going to talk about anything late?  It's not even a good story.  What?  I forgot we kept teasing that.  You're a bigger tease than the Fox show about Temptation Island.  Well, I don't know.  It's trying to get in shape.  Well, don't make it sound like that.  So it could look extra good for the TV show.  I'm not trying to get in shape or anything.  Thank you, Brian. 
[01:21:30]  I'm not serious and I'm like, yeah, I'm going to get all buff and everything.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I just think I could do with a little toning, Opie.  So instead of getting one of those workout things like Cowbell Bill got, the workout, the body blade.  The body blade that hit him in the nuts and the forehead at the same time.  The body blade, which amounts to a strip of steel with a couple of weights on either side of it.  And you go, yeah, yeah, yeah, with the thing.  You shake it back and forth.  He did it in front of his face.  Hit himself in the head and in the nuts.  And then there's been like these workout machines that are supposed to slide under the bed. 
[01:22:00]  And then they stay there because they're too much of a pain in the ass.  It pulls out easily and sets up in seconds.  And they never do.  Why not join a gym?  Because my hours are very wacky.  And it's very hard for me to go to a gym after the show.  You know, I don't get home until 9 o'clock as it is a lot of nights.  What am I going to do?  Go to a gym and then come home.  I'll be beat.  And don't ask me to get up early or anything like that.  I don't want to go before the show because I'm going to be tired. 
[01:22:30]  You got a home gym.  I have a home gym.  Like one of those big universals.  I mean, I'm here and it's like full size, like something you would see in a gym.  Yeah, yeah.  Got all the things, all the features open for every part of your body.  And that's right.  You got enough places to hang everyone's coat when you have coats when you have that next party.  No, and that's the thing.  Every workout machine, all these fads and trendy workout machines become coat racks. 
[01:23:00]  This thing is like a full set of goddamn monkey bars in my bedroom.  Anthony, I'm going to tell you what's going to happen.  All right, go ahead, Opie.  First of all, you set it up last night.  Yeah, I was exhausted after even setting the goddamn thing up.  So officially you've had your first workout?  My first workout was actually lifting the plates up onto the rails that they ride on and lowering them down.  I was like, oh, God, my arms are killing me.  That's funny.  He said plates.  All right.  What, you think I should have just put one there and put the rest in the closet? 
[01:23:30]  Like Brian Regan would say, you're the one plate guy.  Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang, clang.  Okay, thunder.  It's just something.  First of all, it's always there.  Every time I get up in the morning or I'm going to bed at night, it's right there.  Doesn't conveniently store anywhere.  You do a few quick sets as soon as you get up.  There you go.  I'll pump up for the show, Opie.  And then it can't be covered up with coats. 
[01:24:00]  The thing's gigantic.  Yeah, this is the music I play.  I want to be a Hulk, Opie.  I want to be a Hulk, Opie.  I want to be a Hulk, Opie.  I want to be a Hulk, Opie.  I want to be a Hulk, Opie.  I want to be a Hulk, Opie.  If you want to be a Hulk, Opie. 
[01:24:30]  I can sure tell you how to say it.  Oh, wow, that hurts.  This is my credo.  Listen to them.  And pasta beans.  Be quiet, sir.  Always be good to your thing.  And Anthony, knowing our listeners, I'm sure no one is going to take your face and put  them on, like, you know, muscle bodies on OpieAnthony.com.  Making sick pics or anything?  No, I don't think you'll see any of those.  You don't think so? 
[01:25:00]  No, no.  Your head on a ripped body or anything?  No.  Quiet.  You may be a judge for you.  Hang your hat.  Can you feel the music?  Can you feel the beat?  You don't need to...  Here, guys.  Doug.  Doug, what's going on?  What's up?  Treats, say your prayers, eat your vitamins.  Anthony, did a set of arms come into box two?  Shut up, you jackass.  Well, Anthony, we've shared a lot on this show.  I know.  You're just not the workout type.  Well, here's words from my personal trainer. 
[01:25:30]  Now we're having fun.  Yeah.  Now we're having fun.  Mike, what's up?  You're close.  Give them to me.  Now.  You should hire him to lift the weights for you.  Hello, cutie pie.  Hey, Mike, what do you have?  Oh, hey.  Listen, Anthony, who are you kidding?  You're a twig, man.  This is going to be a giant coat rack.  A what?  A giant coat rack.  Oh, a giant coat rack.  It's going to be a giant coat rack, bro.  Yeah.  Well, I'll tell you, it would be a giant one.  It's huge.  You know what's going to happen?  You'll be motivated for two weeks. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  Then you'll be a little sore, so you'll take a little time off.  Next thing you know, you're going to just be staring at this thing when you wake up in the morning.  No, no, no.  I'm starting on steroids.  How are you going to keep motivated?  I'm going to keep motivated.  My motivation is going to be keeping in shape in this music.  That's it.  And it's right there.  Stares me in the face.  What the hell?  It's not something that could be pulled into a closet somewhere.  What the hell happened to you, man?  What?  You're not the same guy. 
[01:26:30]  You're changing.  I am not.  I'm the same ass wife I've always been.  I'm going to get all your friends together.  Oh, and have an intervention?  I'm going to have an intervention.  You son of a bitch.  What happened to your big 70s afro?  What happened to the guy that would just drink until showtime?  Well, something never changed.  And then continue drinking after the show.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, Opie, I have certain responsibilities now to the program. 
[01:27:00]  I'm an employee of two networks.  And I think I have a responsibility to people, to our fans and whatnot.  You guys got to see how smooth Anthony looks on that stage for XFL game day.  And I'm looking at Anthony in the back office going, I do not know that guy.  I'm like, what the hell happened to you?  Let me tell you something.  I was crapping my pants.  You have changed so much before we walked out. 
[01:27:30]  When we first met and we had to go do stuff?  Yeah.  And I'm like, you know, this is a big meeting.  You know, they're looking to hire us in Boston and they're going to fly us to L.A. and stuff.  So do you have anything that looks presentable?  I'll wear my unstained T-shirt today.  No.  If I could find one.  No joke.  His wardrobe consisted of concert shirts.  Right.  And T-shirts with, like, alcohol products on them.  Yeah.  Yes.  And when we had a really important meeting, he would just make sure these shirts were ironed. 
[01:28:00]  Ironed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they wouldn't be.  Am I lying?  No, I'll be here.  Probably.  We are going back a few years.  Oh, yeah.  I don't want people to think this happened yesterday.  No.  But that's the Anthony I remember from the beginning.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now I'm looking at you.  We saw, you know, the show that's going to air Saturday at 730 on NBC.  I'm like, I just, I don't recognize you.  Come on. 
[01:28:30]  You've got, like, a personal fashion designer, I think.  Stylish.  You ever, it's called a girlfriend.  It's like a collared shirt on Anthony?  I know.  And now you're, now you're.  Nice.  She hooks me up.  And now you're working out?  Yeah.  You know, I've got to try to get into a little bit of a better shape.  I'm not.  Look, I'm not unhappy with my body or anything.  I'm not fat.  I'm not.  But I could, I would like to get a little more toned.  Already?  Got to be the gooch, right? 
[01:29:00]  Dry blood.  Dry blood.  Dry blood on opianthony.com.  Holy smoke.  I've taken Anthony's head and put it on one of these ripped bodies.  Look at your six pack.  Yeah.  You're sporting a six pack there.  That's my goal, Opie.  In the old days, you would be carrying the six pack, but now you're.  Yes.  You're, you're sporting one.  Well, you know, as far as the TV show goes.  Someone's got to make a before and after shot.  Yeah.  Thank you.  With a little beanpole or something.  You know, I got to tell you, as far as the TV show goes. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  It came from years.  See, when, what I was doing on the show was everything I had watched on television for  years, because that's the only reference point I had.  And so I was using everything from what I saw on Ronan Martin's Laugh-In and any live  variety show I had seen in my life.  And that's who you saw.  Yeah.  Not me.  Very good.  The solid shirt on Anthony is like an open wallet in Opie's hand. 
[01:30:00]  That's from Dan from Obo.  Ouch.  So keep us informed with your workout program.  I will let you know how it goes.  Mm-hmm.  I'll let you know.  If you have...  I'll keep you updated.  If you have this dedication toward the weights like you have toward your computer games.  Yeah.  Arnold Schwarzenegger, look out.  You know, if I could just figure out a way to work out and play computer games at the  same time.  If I could figure out how to put the game on pause so I could go and work out for a while. 
[01:30:30]  True, yeah.  That's going to be your biggest challenge right there.  Hey, I'll do it tomorrow.  Right.  Ah.  Hmm.  I'll start it tomorrow.  I'm so exhausted from Half-Life.  Unreal is killing me.  Pete, what's up?  Oh, is the editor there?  Huh?  Ah, yes, Pete.  Anthony?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm calling a reference to the U.S. Universal in the paper.  Are you interested in buying it?  Yes, I saw it for sale.  I got into Penny Pinscher. 
[01:31:00]  Hey, Pete, that's funny.  Hey, you're very funny, you bastard.  All right, faggot.  And Berger from New Rochelle, Anthony.  The Joe Piscopo of radio.  Al, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on, bro?  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on.  Do we have that, though?  You guys love, you love this.  Because it doesn't happen to you often.  But we all take our turn in the barrel, but you're rarely there.  Hold on.  I don't understand because I'm trying to better myself, Opie. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  That I have to be subject to this type of abuse.  Al?  Yeah.  What's up?  Yo, what's going on?  Hey.  Ant, I got a strong fee to work out to, bro.  Yeah.  I had a tiger, my friend.  Very funny.  Instant, instant, instant request.  Come on.  I had a tiger.  Hey, how did we know that he was requesting that song?  I had a tiger, Anthony.  I had a tiger.  What's the matter with you? 
[01:32:00]  What's the matter with you?  Hey, you know what?  I got to work out of here.  Anthony, I'm going to have your crap thunder.  And he liked this.  Can we count on you running to work, Anthony?  Yeah, I'm going to run from Brooklyn.  Over the Brooklyn Bridge?  There it is.  I'll run over the Brooklyn Bridge.  Every day will be a friggin' marathon for me.  I need stairs.  I can run up and put my fists in the air and spin around. 
[01:32:30]  In your sweatsuit?  Yeah.  High-fiving people on your way into work?  Exactly.  That would be a funny video.  Me, like, running to work in my sweats.  Listeners.  Will kids be following you as you run down the street?  Yes, a whole gaggle of children.  Right.  That I'll try to get dates from.  Yes, it is the eye of the tiger.  Eh, eh, eh. 
[01:33:00]  Will you be going to Russia, Anthony?  Yeah, I'm going to take on the champ.  I'm the party pooper.  How are you?  How are you?  No problemo.  Now we're having fun.  You son of a bitch.  Good morning.  Ah, I knew it.  All I had to do was bring it up.  Can't get a break from you guys.  My turn in the barrel.  You'll learn.  You'll see.  I start kicking some ass around here. 
[01:33:30]  Uncle John.  Good afternoon.  I'm calling from Mr. Schwarzenegger's office.  If I need to change our workout appointments from 7.30 to 8 o'clock.  No problemo.  Thank you.  Very good.  I have some questions.  Back of the car.  I just didn't care.  Hey, Lisa.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What up?  Oh, man.  Anthony's going to look at that machine.  He's just going to go, one day, I must break you. 
[01:34:00]  And then that's going to be it.  You should go right over the top.  Why doesn't anyone think I can be motivated to do this?  I'm not doing this.  You've got to understand.  I'm not doing this to get, like, Arnold.  You don't think I could...  Shut up and quit your laughing, you bitch.  Listen to her.  Listen to this bitch.  Bye.  Bye.  You're already showing roid rays.  I got roid rays.  Roid rays.  Why can't anyone think that I could use this in a way to stay toned and in shape without 
[01:34:30]  thinking I'm going to try to...  Is that on Hulk's body?  Someone just put my head on Hulk's greased-up body.  And you've got his bandana around your head.  Well, I'm Hulkamania.  Yes, I see that.  Billy.  Yo.  What's up, Billy?  Hey, Ann.  I've got a couple chickens.  Do you want to chase them around?  Great.  I prefer choking them.  Thank you.  Bunch of...  You faggot.  Dave checking in, of course.  No kids chasing him.  Just Anthony running from the retarded Laverne and Shirley. 
[01:35:00]  Now, that would keep me motivated.  That's all you need to get in shape.  Have her chase you every day.  Oh, man.  Come on.  I don't know what the problem is, though.  You can't accept the fact that I will be able to do this and keep on it?  Joe.  Why?  You know, why don't you...  Anthony, why don't you try a push-up before you end up spending all your money?  You know, why don't you lift a chair in your kitchen apartment or something?  Try a push-up.  Very funny.  I mean, it's your hand, man. 
[01:35:30]  Just try your own isometrics.  Why don't you push both hands together?  Do something.  Isometrics.  What does math have to do with it, jerk?  What a tool.  Try a push-up.  You know something?  It's a little easier, first of all, ass monkey, to get into a regimen when the motivation  and the equipment are right there, available.  It's easier to do certain routines on this machine than it would be for me to remember 
[01:36:00]  to get down and do push-ups.  John, what's up?  Hey, Anthony.  Yes.  The only explanation I can possibly think of is that you saw Don West hocking this on  the Home Shopping Network last night.  You've got to get this workout machine.  It's the best one ever.  You're not going to believe this.  I use it myself, and look at the shape I'm in.  And we're going to give you...  You can open your own gym with this.  Start your own gym. 
[01:36:30]  And we're giving away Tiger Woods Rookie Card.  Unbelievable.  Look at the way this thing works.  Look.  Look at the pulleys moving.  The weights are moving.  God damn it, I can't believe it.  Why try push-ups when you can buy this?  Why lift a chair in your house when you can do this?  This is the best gym ever, period, end of story.  The best one ever till the next one I shall.  Period, end of, no more better ever, ever, ever. 
[01:37:00]  And you can send it back for a full refund  as long as you haven't moved it once  in any way, shape, or form.  Hey, Ant, did you buy workout gloves?  No, I didn't buy workout gloves.  This is the most funnest workout you're ever going to have.  None more more funner-er.  All right.  Very funny.  Scooter from Westchester.  Bud Light is not a protein drink.  Very funny.  Everyone's a comic.  Uh-huh. 
[01:37:30]  Opie, uh, Ant, don't sweat it.  Opie's just jealous because he can't fit a universal  through the door and up the stairs of his treehouse he lives in.  Dan from Ovo.  Very good, Dan.  All right, yeah, we've got to go to spots.  Okay.  All right, whatever.  Good.  Am I done in the barrel?  Can I come out?  You did a great job.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'll keep you updated on my progress.  All right.  212-757-1027.  As we go to spots.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Jackassers. 
[01:38:00]  And one.  And two.  And three.  And one.  I want to be a Hulkamaniac, Opie.  With my family and friends.  Have fun with my family and friends.  I want to be a Hulkamaniac.  I'm Big Dick Black.  I'm Big Dick Black.  If you want to be a Hulkamaniac,  I can sure tell you how to stay on track.  You got to train things.  No!  The Hulkamaniacs do.  Possible thoughts and positive deeds. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, my God.  I want to be a Hulkamaniac.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, great.  Good, baby.  Very good.  Can you see every painful detail of my muscular physique?  So, what do you think of my tight pants?  You ever seen a grown man naked? 
[01:39:00]  All right.  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  You people are tools, man.  Can I come out of the barrel?  Yeah.  Yeah, you can, Anthony.  Thank you.  Right after this call.  Uh, Craig.  Yes, Craig.  Hey, as soon as you're going to be in front of a mirror,  going, there is no tomorrow.  There is no tomorrow.  All right, Apollo Creed.  You suck. 
[01:39:30]  Take it easy.  All right.  Christmas jersey.  See, you'll have better luck sleeping on it and getting muscles by osmosis.  Hey, Steve.  What's up?  Hey.  What's going on, man?  You going to start wearing a guinea cheese every day now to work to show off the new muscles?  Very good.  If you come in with one of those shirts, I think I'll...  Who do you think I am?  Vinnie the racist?  I know what I'm talking about, Anthony. 
[01:40:00]  Wow.  Jason from Staten Island.  Anthony starring in the sequel to Pumping Iron called Pumping Aluminum.  Very good.  Funny, funny people.  All right.  I guess that was pretty good that we teased your little workout, Jim.  Thank you so much.  Okay.  Stay there.  From the heart of Tom Square in New York, New York, it's XFL Game Day.  And here's your host, Opie and Anthony.  I will remember you. 
[01:40:30]  I didn't know XFL Game Day was hosted by Crockett and Tubbs.  Will you remember me?  This is going to take football where it's supposed to be.  Don't let your life pass you by.  Let's check in with Rusty Tillman and Bruce Bess.  You are the only man.  The Mad Dog.  I just want to talk a little bit about this bomb called the XFL. 
[01:41:00]  I'm so tired.  I can't see.  Well, first of all, I don't even get...  Look at a football in front of me.  You see that thing?  What's the red and the black?  That much I can believe.  Football's a brown.  It's funny how it feels.  Hey, you're talking about the pigskin.  You're ruining the classic elements of the game.  You're screaming inside.  The only way you can't be heard.  I will remember you. 
[01:41:30]  Bruce, did you realize that one of the L.A. cheerleaders is a massage therapist?  Will you remember me?  Can they cook?  Don't let your life pass you by.  We've not gone.  Welcome back to XFL Game Day.  Ah!  You suck.  Let's check in with Rusty Tillman and Bruce Bess. 
[01:42:00]  Let me help you with those melons.  A lot of people think that it's easy to be a cheerleader in the XFL.  It's brutal.  You will see for yourself that Anthony cheated and he pushed me.  I'm so afraid to love you.  Obie is going to retrieve the tea after the kickoff.  Clinging to a path that doesn't let me in truth.  You look like an ass.  I'm so afraid to love you. 
[01:42:30]  Obviously, you haven't seen the show.  That man.  It's so good that I think it might even go over your head.  No, it's so good.  I don't even think you need to watch it.  Yeah.  It runs itself.  It runs itself.  Just like the XFL.  Great athleticism, guys. 
[01:43:00]  Even though, oh, remember me.  Does the green bring out my eyes?  I will remember you.  And they're covering up the flaws.  Give me a moment.  Oh, it's pretty.  Will you remember me?  Oh, come on in.  Come on, make them look pretty.  I met your life.  Can we go to Rusty and Bruce, please? 
[01:43:30]  We've not fallen there.  Anthony, the build-up is finally over.  Bruce, what are you talking about?  Back to you.  Bruce and Obie.  We've not fallen there.  And we'll see you next week on XFL Game Day.  Thanks for joining us.  Bruce, that was awesome.  You've got to be kidding me.  There's absolutely no point in XFL. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, yeah.  All right.  I'm upstairs now with the king. 
[01:44:30]  All right.  With the king.  Yep.  All right.  He's in our lobby.  We're going to try to figure out if he's worthy enough to come down and hang with us today,  Anthony.  All right.  All right.  Here he is.  Hello.  Hey, king.  Hello.  Hello there.  Hello.  How's it going?  King.  King.  Yeah.  Is this the king?  Yeah.  Okay.  You sound like the king.  I hear that voice.  Now we've got your CD Gravelance.  Do you like it?  Yeah. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  It's great.  It's quite different.  I guess the concept is you're the king singing other people's songs that are dead.  Yeah.  And we played Come As You Are in Sweet Home, Alabama on our show already.  Thank you.  Getting rave reviews by our listeners.  And they like it, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's great.  So why imitate the king?  Well, it's someone I have loved and admired since I was seven years old. 
[01:45:30]  Do you know why we have you on the phone?  No.  Why?  We're trying to decide if you're worthy or not to come down here and hang with us.  And so far, you're not winning the battle.  All right.  I'm serious.  So what else did you give us?  We did several acoustic songs.  Yeah.  So you're going to...  And answer any questions that you want to have answered.  Well, there's not many questions we want to ask an Elvis impersonator. 
[01:46:00]  Are you an Elvis impersonator?  Do you dress up like Elvis and stuff?  Well, I wear a black leather costume.  Yeah.  Similar to the one that Elvis wore in a 60-year TV special.  You sound very excited.  Well, I've been up for 4.30 this morning.  I'm exhausted.  Yeah.  We had so many plans delayed on us in Chicago.  And it's been a real long day.  We're setting up a special studio for you, King. 
[01:46:30]  Right.  So I'm worthy then.  Well, I don't know if you're worthy yet.  I think you need some stack or two.  Well, here's our plan.  Right.  Here's our plan.  We want you to do a couple...  At least one song from your Gravelands CD.  Yeah.  But we want you to perform it in the bathroom here at N.E.W.  Can you do that?  In the bathroom?  In the bathroom, on the potty.  We're setting up a microphone and everything.  Yeah, we'll have a mic in there for you.  On the potty?  Yeah.  No. 
[01:47:00]  Headphones and stuff.  So, well, you don't have to take your pants down or anything.  You've just got to sit on the toilet.  No.  And play your song.  No, I don't want to do that.  Why not?  Because I think it's sick.  Why is that sick?  Because it...  I heard there's good acoustics in the bathroom.  Because Elvis Presley died in the bathroom.  Well, yeah, that's the reason we want to do it.  Yeah, that'll give it more of a...  The ultimate tribute to the king himself.  What do you say?  We'll negotiate this point. 
[01:47:30]  We'll...  We'll plug...  They want me to sing from the bathroom.  We'll plug your CD.  We'll allow you to play a couple songs.  Because Elvis died in the bathroom.  It's like the king on his throne.  I'm just saying...  They wanted to talk to me on the phone first to see if I was maybe worthy enough to sign into the studio.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what do you think?  I'm worthy enough to go to the studio, no problem.  But I don't want to sing from the bathroom.  Why not?  That'll be neat.  We have a mic in there and everything. 
[01:48:00]  I'm not going to sit on the toilet and sing.  On the toilet and sing?  No.  See, now, it doesn't sound like you have much of a sense of humor about you.  Are you a funny guy?  A fun guy?  Or are you very serious?  You're a pretty serious dude.  I would say, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, having five children...  Dude, it's a goof...  And a mortgage is pretty serious.  It's a goof CD, so we're going to goof around with you.  What can I tell you?  It's a goof CD.  A goof.  Goof.  Not good.  Goof.  It's kind of goofy. 
[01:48:30]  Goof.  Goofy?  Wouldn't you think?  Yeah.  Like, it's kind of...  Don't you think it's a little weird?  Like, I would think you would have this tremendous sense of humor.  It's a fun, warm-hearted CD.  It was okay.  I mean...  Tribute.  I thought the music was good.  I thought the impersonation needed a little work, but...  Well, that's your opinion.  You're attentive to it.  So what do you say, King?  No.  We got the studio set up?  No.  It's a great...  It's a great room, acoustically? 
[01:49:00]  I don't know.  I don't want to sing from the bathroom.  Sitting on the toilet.  Is that just because you would never sing from a bathroom?  It's out of respect for Elvis Presley.  Out of respect for Elvis?  I think Elvis would be into something like this.  No.  Come on.  We wanted you to, you know, be naked in there.  We'll take that away.  So you just have to sit on the toilet.  No.  I don't want to sit on the toilet.  Why not?  I just explained why.  What if the lid was down?  Yeah, the lid will be down. 
[01:49:30]  I don't care if the lid's down or up or...  You don't have to, like...  The cubicle door is open or closed or whatever.  You don't have to take a dump when you hit the high notes or something, you know?  We're just looking for you to sit on the ball.  We'll have a mic in there, headphones.  So that's how Elvis Presley died, is it?  I guess.  That's what they say.  That's what they say, but I don't think it was during his performance of a song.  Come on.  You're an Elvis impersonator.  Yeah.  You do other people's dead songs.  Yeah.  So you should have a sense of humor and do this.  And then we'll plug the CD and everything. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, but it's not the...  It's a rocket regime.  It's a...  Hey, King, you're making money off other dead artists' work.  Right.  I'm making money.  I haven't made any money.  You know, you sing a...  I haven't made any money.  How do you know what money I've made?  You sing a Nirvana song, a Leonard Skinner song, an ACG song, Jimi Hendrix.  Excuse me.  You are making money off other dead people's work by playing the records on your radio station.  Yeah, and we'll spin records from the bathroom, too. 
[01:50:30]  James Cameron made the film Titanic, so you want to start accusing him of making money off  people's dead.  Oh, we hit a soft spot, I believe.  We're not accusing you of anything.  All we're saying is...  We're just saying if you're going to sing other people's songs that are dead, that you should  have a sense of humor to perform them on the toilet as Elvis.  No.  As Elvis.  No.  Elvis died on the toilet.  Get it?  No.  Are you, like, in love with Elvis?  I've explained that I don't want to get on the toilet and sing out of respect for the  memory of Elvis.  Are you in love with Elvis? 
[01:51:00]  Is that it?  Like, you have this love for him?  Yeah, fraternal love.  Anything wrong with that?  Faternal love?  Anything wrong with the fraternal love?  Or have you found a way to make money off his name?  What?  Just ask him.  Elvis seemed to have had a sense of humor.  Yeah, he had a wonderful sense of humor.  Great sense of humor.  Yeah, and that's kind of a weird sense of humor thing to perform one of the songs sitting  on the toilet.  No.  No?  So what do you say, King?  I've already told you about 20 times.  I thought we could talk you into it. 
[01:51:30]  What?  I thought we could talk you into it.  No.  See, I guess you didn't really know much about our show then, huh?  No.  We have every artist that ever comes into Opie and Anthony's studio performs from the bathroom.  That's right.  No.  And it's just a coincidence that Elvis died on the toilet.  We didn't even take that into consideration, but...  No.  It is kind of the way it's set up.  Well, all right.  So your final answer is no?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  I guess we could play your CD from here then. 
[01:52:00]  Well, it's up to you.  All right.  Would you like me...  Would you like to hear me play it?  Well, I would like to go into the studio where you are and perform the songs.  Well, no, no.  The deal is...  We can't do that.  The deal is you perform from the bathroom or that song.  No.  All right.  Well, then I'll play your CD here in the studio.  Why can't you let me go into the studio and perform the songs like that?  Because we will...  It's much more fun if you do it in the bathroom.  Yeah.  No. 
[01:52:30]  No?  You sound intense, man.  What?  You sound like you're going to cry or something.  You all right?  Yeah.  I'm not fine.  You sound intense.  All right.  Do you ever lighten up or loosen up or laugh or something?  Sometimes.  Yeah.  Not now.  Don't have a sense of humor, huh?  It doesn't sound like...  All right.  Well, would you like to listen as I play your CD here in the studio?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go. 
[01:53:00]  Did you hear that?  Yeah.  All right.  All right, King.  There's pieces of CD all over the studio.  Well, do you think you're the one who has to clean it up? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, that's all right, though.  It was worth it.  All right, man.  Have a great weekend.  I will.  All right.  See ya.  Bye-bye.  Oh, my God.  I don't think that step was necessary, Opie.  What?  I understand he wasn't going to sing from the bathroom, but... 
[01:54:00]  Now, Rick's got to go deal with this.  Why is everyone leaving me?  I don't know.  I think you were a little harsh.  Nah, he was being rude to us, too, man.  All right, we've got to take a break.  I thought he was going to sing from the bathroom.  I swear to God I thought we were going to get him to sing from the bathroom.  Well, that would have been fun, right?  Yeah.  What was the big deal?  Well, he seemed to not want to do it because of Elvis. 
[01:54:30]  Elvis died on the toilet.  All right.  So, out of his love for Elvis.  What happened?  I thought we were just having fun.  Keep the 14-year-old away from us.  Have a drink.  I want to bang you.  This is normal radio, right?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I don't know what it is.  You guys have to drive down there and bash your heads in with a baseball bat.  I don't know what to think of this, to be honest with you.  Why do you have to play this?  What do you mean you don't know?  All right.  All right.  We could do that.  What song do you suggest we play?  Well, I think Joe Cousin's name would be good. 
[01:55:00]  Excuse Opie, Joe.  He's not a, you know, paesan.  No.  Uh-oh.  He might not understand.  You'd be shoving me in the back of a car, I think.  Well, you can play Wiseguy, too, the rap thing, if you like it.  If we like to...  Joe Pesci rapping?  That's it.  I wrote a thing called Wiseguy.  Can you do a little rap for us on the phone?  No, I couldn't.  You don't know how hard that is.  Those guys are really good.  I didn't know how hard that was.  Yeah, a little white Italian guy.  Can't rap like a black guy.  No, I did it as a white guy. 
[01:55:30]  All right, wait.  I got to hear Joe Pesci rapping.  This is Wiseguy off Joe Pesci's new CD.  Check it out.  It's a bitch's daddy kitchen.  It's a bitch's daddy kitchen.  It's a bitch's daddy kitchen.  Hey, hey.  Fade out my ass.  Treat all my bras like trash.  You'll catch a blast if you move too fast.  I talk for class. 
[01:56:00]  You don't have to ask.  Getting everything by flash and cash.  Fighting and stealing.  Don't kill without stealing.  So I went in casinos before they started dealing.  All about respect and intellect.  Only mess with the women that pick up the check.  Supermodels are one on each arm.  One chick's brunette and the other was blonde.  I heard their fathers had thoughts and moms.  So I f***ed them up and left them floating in a pond.  Custom-made clothes from head to toe.  So do you expect to sell any of these things?  What do you mean do I expect to sell any of them?  What do you think I'm going to do?  Pay for my house with them? 
[01:56:30]  Or tie on my bathroom because of the little plastic squares?  He's going to whack you, Opie.  Listen, you're going to like it.  You'll have some fun with it.  Well, can I use it for a beer coaster, maybe?  I don't know.  I think you should try to play it first.  Okay.  He's getting mad.  I'm trying to get you mad.  I want to hear the fashion that we all know and love.  Do you have your bleeper in your hand?  Yeah, I do.  Go for it.  No, I don't want to do that.  Come on.  I'm the fastest bleeper in the world, actually. 
[01:57:00]  Get the f*** out of here.  I hit it.  I hit it in time.  I hope so.  Come on, challenge me.  Go ahead.  That's it.  Come on.  I'll give you another plug for the CD.  No, that's it.  You play it.  That'll be enough of a plug.  Hey, thanks.  I appreciate it, guys.  Thanks, Joe.  Thank you.  Take it easy, Joe.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. 
[01:57:30]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  We're talking about Louie Anderson.  We've stated in the past that I don't get it.  He's not funny.  Don't you have to be funny to have the label a comedian?  Yeah.  I guess so.  I don't know.  But I don't know.  I guess this stuff is so tragic that it becomes funny or something.  That's what it is.  People laugh a lot of times because they're uncomfortable.  Sometimes comics get on stage and they either have an affliction or something. 
[01:58:00]  He's saying he would be like Ted Bundy?  Yeah.  If he didn't have that great humor that he has?  Yeah.  That's a stretch.  Ted Bundy was skinny and got chicks.  That's how he was able to kill him.  Now, you did hear at the end of the interview, though, he's going to be hosting the new Family  Feud.  Family Feud.  That's what you need.  Remember what happened to the last post?  He hung himself.  Didn't he hang himself?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Louie sounds more depressed than Ray Combs ever did. 
[01:58:30]  You think Louie Anderson's going to do the whole Richard Dawson and try to, like, get  kisses and stuff?  I'm out of kiss, honey.  Hey, baby.  What's your name?  Yeah.  Hey, welcome to the feud.  I'm fat and I was abused as a child.  All right.  Look at the family is coming to the table.  Give me a kiss, honey.  Do you have any food stuck between your teeth I could suck out while I kiss you? 
[01:59:00]  I'm starving.  I haven't eaten in a second.  Gee.  All right.  If we could get the first two contestants up here.  We surveyed our audience the top five answers on the board to this question.  What did your father hit you with?  All right.  Um, Louie, uh, a baseball bat?  Eh.  No. 
[01:59:30]  Well, that's the number two answer.  My father hit me with a baseball bat.  All right.  You have a chance to steal.  Um, Louie, is it a whiskey bottle?  Yes, it's a whiskey bottle.  That's right.  He lobbed it at my head after calling me a big, fat bastard.  Oh, there's a Louie.  There I go.  What a scream!  All right.  Next question.  Surveyed our audience's top three answers on the board. 
[02:00:00]  This question.  What was the cruelest thing you were called in school by your little classmates?  Turned you into an introverted, inverted, eating freak machine.  Uh, big, fat, hubby, marshmallow, cellulite, 200 pounds of chewed bubblegum ass?  And that's the number one answer.  I never knew what the end of that was because my head was always in the gymnasium toilet answer.  Right when they started saying it.  I didn't have to go to the cafeteria and eat Twinkies and Ho-Hos. 
[02:00:30]  Feed this 450-pound Jabba the Hutt mess freak show ass.  But I've turned tragedy into comedy.  If you find the comedy, give me a call.  Hey, we're playing the feud, family feud.  Look who it is.  It's the Anderson family.  My own family coming up. 
[02:01:00]  Hi, Dad.  Hey, she's going to call me a big, fat, tub-ass, lard-ass again.  This is great stuff, isn't it?  Here comes my big, fat, enabling mother.  Gee, thanks, Mom.  Here I am in the midst of turning tragedy into comedy.  Can you feel it, people?  Feel the comedy.  Excuse me, have I eaten in two minutes?  I'm way past my eating time. 
[02:01:30]  Top five answers on the board to this.  When do I have to eat?  Uh, now?  That's right.  Now.  Right now.  Thank you for playing the feud.  I gotta eat.  Thank you, Dad.  I gotta tune in to that.  Yeah, I can't wait to see that on TV.  Fat Louie.  All right.  Well, I hope you enjoy that.  Whoever's still listening. 
[02:02:00]  And action.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  Okay, terrific.  And cut.  Opie Anthony.  Hey, let's see.  So.  You have a race in the match.  You have a girl.  I was anticipating.  You have girls that fight.  Yes.  You got a little magazine there?  I got some magazines.  All right.  Let me take a look.  And I'm on the cover. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, that's you on the cover.  Can I have a magazine?  You will have a magazine.  Oh, my God.  I bought some videos.  You can take that one.  I have some CDs.  And I have some gifts for the girls.  Cat Spats.  Special issue.  Cocky Cat Fighters.  Woo.  How about that?  Go get them.  So you're in charge of the catfighting in New York City?  Well, not per se.  I mean, I work for a company.  They're Crystal Films.  And if you want more information, you can find them at catfight1.com.  You can get some information there. 
[02:03:00]  Could you take it down a notch?  Take it down a notch.  Who's the chick with the braces?  Oh, my God.  She got her teeth straightened out before they took them off.  Oh, really?  No melee.  Yeah.  What are the rules of catfighting?  We thought the rules were really simple.  The girl that gets her clothes ripped off first loses.  Not necessarily.  The way we've been doing them for the last 87 years is by points.  We have judges. 
[02:03:30]  Ah, the point system.  Is there any hardcore sex in these videos?  Or is it just chicks punching each other?  No, pretty much.  Girls going at each other.  I saw the video back in the office.  You would like it.  A lot of hair pulling.  Yeah.  The only two things that we do not allow is fist punching in the face and eye gouging.  That's best left at home anyway.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we'll see what happens.  We've got a lot of girls coming down for this, Ant.  Don't worry.  Well, I mean, it's up for grabs.  I know our listeners.  Up for grabs. 
[02:04:00]  Us by who?  Oh, I'll up for grabs.  I know our listeners won't let us down.  Okay.  Your girls might let us down.  We've got some wild girls associated with the show.  We've got teenagers that are going to do teen catfighting today.  Okay.  How old are they?  Like 13, 14.  Nice.  I want to see.  I want to face.  No, not 13.  14 or 18.  Legal.  Still considered teens.  You know, the barely legal variety.  Okay.  Well, that's acceptable.  All right.  I want them to get, like, their necks and leg locks and leave hickeys. 
[02:04:30]  Are we allowed to jump in and throw a punch or two if you want?  No, sir.  No punching.  There's no punching at last.  No punching and no eye-douging.  Aren't you listening to it?  How about an open-handed slap, maybe, or a good nipple?  The audience is not allowed to participate.  Hey, can I jump in?  Because I used to punch Robin Gibbons right in the face, and it was wonderful.  That was the best punch I ever threw on my whole effing wife.  And I punched Robin Gibbons.  She flew across the room and hit the wall.  It was wonderful.  More power to him. 
[02:05:00]  And then I bit her ear off.  No guy on girl stuff.  You've never done that.  The girls that I'm bringing down, they do fight guys.  Oh, they do?  Yes.  So if you want to talk to them when they show up, you can make an arrangement or an appointment  with them, and there'll be more than that.  All right.  I thought of something during the commercial break.  I thought of something during the commercial break.  It's a talent Opie has that is amazing.  He's 100% on this.  He could tell people's age. 
[02:05:30]  You know, Ann, I don't think it was.  No, no, no, no, don't even back down on this.  He could tell people's age from the taint.  You know what the taint is?  I don't think I want to show off my skills today, Ann.  Mayleg.  No, no.  Fox News is here, you know.  No, because I've got to see this.  This is amazing.  We've done this before.  He never fails.  You know what the taint is, Mayleg?  Where?  It taint the front of you, and it taint the back of you.  It's taint, you know what I mean?  Right in the middle, in between. 
[02:06:00]  It's right there in the magazine.  It's the part most covered with the gray hair.  The taint.  The taint.  Right where the stripe is.  And I know, because this is a great test.  Would you show Opie your taint, and he can guess your age?  It's a miracle.  You will be amazed.  It's like watching Kreskin work.  I'm a little tired today.  I don't really want to show off my skills.  You're not backing out of this one.  Would you, and if you want privacy, just show Opie, but he will guess your age from just looking at your taint. 
[02:06:30]  I am really good at it.  Show me, Opie, please, humor me a minute.  Well, would you just go over there and show up your taint?  We do have a lot of new cities listening to the show, too.  You'll be amazed.  Would you please just show up your taint?  Can you take a picture?  Um, no.  Could you just, it's easy.  You go over to that side of the console.  I'll do it first.  You're wearing a dress.  Colin, show up your taint.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Is this going to be on the O'Reilly Factor or something?  I swear to God, we thought Norton was like 24 until he got drunk in the office. 
[02:07:00]  Opie, like, blurted it out when you had that episode.  Please, eh.  No, could you please just, just, I will guess your age.  Take off the headphones.  Yeah.  Take off the headphones.  Walk over to that side and watch.  You'll be amazed.  I'll guess it within a year.  Without a doubt.  Within a year?  No.  I've never failed.  He's never failed to hit it on the mark.  Yeah, but if she just had a birthday or...  Don't say anything.  You know what I mean?  Just...  Could you take your headphones off and walk over there?  You'll be stunned.  He's not going to look at the other areas.  No.  He's right in the middle of the tank.  Just in the middle. 
[02:07:30]  Right.  Thank you, Colin.  If you don't want this film, you just tell the crew and they will not film it.  No filming.  They wouldn't show this.  They're not going to show this on Fox.  No filming.  Yeah, Fox News is going to show this.  Fox 5 coming up.  Change.  We'll show you a 10.  Taint.  By the way, Anthony, a payback is a bitch.  Yeah.  Oh, here she goes.  Now, go around that way.  Oh, that's okay.  I understand.  She's got to take off some stuff.  Come on.  She's a bro.  Yeah.  And I'm going to kill you.  No, because I'm stunned at this. 
[02:08:00]  This is outrageous.  This is a great idea.  All right.  Show the taint.  Show the taint to open.  No, no, no.  You've got to go around that way.  Right.  No, you can back up.  Who knows where the taint is here?  Lift up.  I'm going to learn really quick.  Wait, wait.  I can't do this.  Opie, do it for crying out loud.  I'm not feeling my talent today.  No.  No feeling.  I'm really not feeling it.  Use the force loop.  No, no.  You're going to read it.  You sexy.  Come on.  I am not feeling this today.  Stare into Medusa.  My psychic powers are on my imagination. 
[02:08:30]  Let her do it.  Opie, don't ruin it.  All right.  Back up a little, though.  She said it.  Take a look.  It's like Karnak.  All right.  All right.  Now, watch this.  Now, you've got to lift up.  Now, lift up.  Take a look at the taint, Opie.  No, lift up a little.  Just a little more.  There it is.  See?  You see it?  Taking a look.  Oh.  Did you get it?  No, no.  Did you get it?  No, I had him look away.  Don't look away.  What are you?  It looks like...  I stared into the face of Medusa.  All right.  Take a good look and guess the age. 
[02:09:00]  I'm looking like an idiot because this is an amazing thing.  Yeah.  And you're not...  All right.  Take a good look.  Stare into the abyss.  There you go.  Get the abyss.  It looks like a documentary.  I'm back for a popper.  You have to...  Oh, you've got to show him a little more real estate with...  There you go.  There she goes.  Opie.  Wow, look at that.  Now, watch this.  I'm stunned whenever he does this.  Opie, please.  Yes, the age.  Will you shut up?  I'm working it out in my head right now. 
[02:09:30]  All right.  It looks like a documentary on Sarajevo.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  If you could just a little...  Yeah, right there.  All right.  You're taking a look.  Okay.  One, two, three...  Now, do you do some kind of math?  I don't know what it is.  It's an aspicus.  Alchemy.  I'm almost alchemy.  I've turned it into gold.  I'm almost there.  Is there a turtle head poking out?  Okay.  I got it. 
[02:10:00]  Yes.  All right.  I hate you.  Now, we'll get you back.  Buckle in.  You're going to love this.  Here, sit over there, because if I'm wrong, I don't want you to punch me.  Yeah, because...  Well, I've never seen you...  I've never seen you come up wrong on this.  I must say...  It gets stunned.  A bit deceiving.  Why?  I was going to go a little older.  Were you?  Yeah.  Now, judging by her taint alone, you will tell us her age.  Well, she just showed us over 40.  Yeah.  She should not be in that magazine, Anthony. 
[02:10:30]  Whoa.  You're saying she's younger than 40?  No.  She's...  Oh, really?  She should be in over 50.  Am I right so far?  How old?  Watch this.  She's had a birthday.  Uh-oh.  See that?  Okay.  Then I'm going to change my guess.  Why?  Because if she didn't have a birthday, then I would...  I'm going to go 52 years old.  How old are you?  Holy Jesus!  Nice!  All right.  You know something?  He never gets it wrong. 
[02:11:00]  You are amazing.  Wow.  Holy ass.  You look like two miles of mad road.  What gave it away?  Was it the Calvin Coolidge stamp on the train?  What's the secret?  How is that about it?  It's amazing.  You know something?  It's just something that...  You learned it from your father and his father before him.  Right.  It's been passed on for generations.  I believe they found out the age of the pharaoh using the same technique in the pyramids.  It is a gift. 
[02:11:30]  It's a gift.  What would you call it?  52 years old, right?  Unless he's been with another woman.  It's a gift.  Are those lips or war bonds?  Well, after having four children.  That's great.  Well, that's why I was going to go a little older.  Four children.  It's a little rough.  A little rough.  Brian, what's going on?  How do you figure it out?  By, like, lip dry or something?  No.  Brian, we will never know.  I am probably closer to Opie than many people.  We've worked together for years.  He will not tell me how the hell he does this, but it's amazing 100% every time. 
[02:12:00]  There's counting involved.  There is some kind of math involved.  Counting.  Yeah.  Micromotors is on there?  What do you look at?  You're stunned.  I could say, well, it's kind of like counting rings almost.  Is it almost like rings of a tree?  Yeah, but each ring is a certain group of years.  Oh, okay.  Oh, how about that?  Isn't that something?  Funded amazing.  Once again.  Colin, what do you think? 
[02:12:30]  Isn't that amazing?  It really is quite a talent.  Yeah.  You do only women or?  He's got to market that somehow.  Practice on my cats, you know, so I get enough to come on the show and do it.  Different.  All right.  Boy, thank you.  I know how he does it.  It's amazing.  How do you know, Jim?  It's math.  It's math.  It's got something to do with the distance between one area and the other area.  And you subtract the nose clip and multiply by pie. 
[02:13:00]  Where was my nose clip?  No, where was mine?  Pointless.  Somebody dropped pennies in a dog's mouth.  How'd you like to suck my ass?  No, that's okay.  Hey, I'm Anthony.  Some cat fighters have arrived.  Really?  All right.  Is your hair turning gray now?  Shut up.  All of a sudden, he looked like Moses after he looked at the burning bush.  I have looked into the face of God Almighty. 
[02:13:30]  He did turn red.  He's so red.  That's because I was holding my breath here.  It's clean.  I hope he just stared into Mount River Rat.  Al, what's up?  How are you doing?  I do it myself.  You have to calibrate the thickness of the callus.  All right.  Now I'm getting completely disgusted.
