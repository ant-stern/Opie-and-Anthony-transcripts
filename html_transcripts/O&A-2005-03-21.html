<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts discussing pre-show technical difficulties, punctuated by Opie's crude joke.  They then transitioned into a discussion of Opie's upcoming satellite radio venture and planned road tour, met with Anthony's mocking skepticism. Opie's germaphobia and handshake aversion were highlighted with a humorous anecdote.  The show then tackled the Terry Schiavo case, offering their opinions and criticizing government involvement, interspersed with listener calls, including one suggesting putting Schiavo "in the movies."  This led to a discussion of a Daily News scratch-off game printing error resulting in numerous large payouts, with producer Eric winning $100,000.  Listeners called in to share their experiences and reactions, leading to a debate about fairness and the Daily News' response.  A prank call where a listener was tricked into believing they won $100,000 only to receive a candy bar was recounted. The graphic details of a chimp attack on a couple were shared, followed by a doctor's call describing a patient's chest pains after a lottery loss.  Further listener calls about the scratch-off game and other topics ensued. Staff member Ben shared anecdotes of encounters with Matt Lauer and an "O.C." cast member. Finally, the hosts provided an update on the health of Wheeze, mentioning his telescope use to observe neighbors, and announced upcoming guests Ozzy Osbourne, Rob Halford, and possibly Mitch Hedberg.

The next segment started with a discussion of Mitch Hedberg's alleged drug use and erratic stage behavior, based on accounts of a recent show where he appeared intoxicated, used a pipe on stage, and interacted strangely with the audience. The hosts speculated about whether this was an act or genuine substance abuse, mentioning rumors of heroin use and gangrene.  This segued into a discussion about the show's upcoming move off the premium XM channel, highlighting the confusion caused by conflicting promotional materials announcing different dates (April 2nd and April 11th).  A phone interview with Rob Halford of Judas Priest followed, covering the band's reunion tour, new album, and Halford's Ozzfest fill-in experience.  A caller criticized Anthony's perceived dismissiveness towards Halford. Further discussion of the show's promotional strategies ensued, including a heated exchange with a caller, Javalog G, expressing frustration with the show's self-promotion.  The segment also included promotion for their April 11th Boston live show, plans to raise money for Wheelchair Fred, more discussion of promotional material mishaps, various listener calls, audio clips of Mitch Hedberg's stand-up, and a song by a juror from the Robert Blake trial attempting a music career.

A substantial portion of the following segment was dedicated to the merciless mocking of a listener-submitted music CD, criticizing its poor audio quality, the musician's lack of skill (including audible counting), and the vocalist's inaudibility. Comparisons to William Hung and the Terry Schiavo Christmas CD were made. The listener's song titles "Ergo" and "Judgment Day" were mentioned, and Paul from Georgia also commented on the music. This transitioned into a discussion of the surprising success of Pat from Munaki's compilation CD of past show appearances, outselling the listener's CD despite being free and available on OAVirus.com. Pat called in to confirm the CD's popularity and its limited edition status, also mentioning it being XM content and recounting a humorous encounter with a female listener. A significant portion then focused on a hoax website, SaveToby.com, where someone threatened to kill and eat their rabbit unless they received $50,000, with the hosts and a caller, Mark, discussing its legitimacy and legality, concluding it was a hoax based on Snopes.com. Chris Jericho called in to promote Fozzy's new song and video, discussing their European success, the band's evolution, the MTV-censored ending of their "Enemy" video (featuring Eddieâ€™s building jump), his XM radio show, the state of professional wrestling, WrestleMania, his broken coccyx, and past appearances on the show using a wrestling persona. The segment ended with discussion of a planned segment featuring other morning radio shows, the impending end of their premium channel, continued booger-eating mocking, an anecdote of Opie's booger-ruined couch, and brief mentions of Cindy Adams and Dice Clay.

The next segment started with discussions about bodily fluids and unsanitary situations, featuring anecdotes about earwax, boogers (including one found in Anthony's couch), and a prison incident involving a colostomy bag.  Childhood memories of finding and eating old gum were also shared.  The latter half focused on the upcoming Ozzy Osbourne interview, including a brief discussion of a "Terry Schiavo Photoshop contest" and film critiques, heavily criticizing Sylvester Stallone's movies.  The segment concluded with Ozzy Osbourne's in-studio appearance, where he discussed his ATV accident, recovery, sobriety, family life, health, views on the afterlife, his family's MTV show experiences, his feelings about the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and his infamous bat-eating incident.

The final segment consisted of a studio interview with Ozzy Osbourne, covering topics such as his past musical work (including original "Warpigs" lyrics, the renaming of "Snowblown" to avoid cocaine references, and his recent box set), his career (opening for Kiss, dealing with bootlegged merchandise, and his relationship with Black Sabbath), his reaction to inaccurate press coverage (including cosmetic surgery), and his current projects (a new box set, television appearances, and a Broadway musical about Rasputin).  The interview was punctuated by humorous moments, including Ozzy's frank and profane responses, reactions to inaccurate press, and the hosts' playful banter.  The segment concluded with Ozzy's expletive-laden farewell.

[00:04:30]  You're a filthy whore. I'm Big Dick Black. 
[00:05:00]  Ah! Not that big a deal. Just a little, little thing. But everyone saw that, right? Yeah. 
[00:05:30]  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program, the O.N.A. virus spreading across America thanks  to XM Satellite Radio, the number one satellite radio provider in the world. Oh, wow. Anthony  and I were pushing buttons on our machines here, trying to give you the comedy of the 
[00:06:00]  sound clips during the beginning of the show. You know. You're just a tool. Get on your  hands and knees like a dog. Yeah, fun stuff. Let's do it! You're fired!  So we're pushing buttons like idiots. Nothing's happening. Everyone comes running in here in  the panic. No one touches anything. Yeah, no one touched a thing. So then I push another  button and then it's on the air. And it works. Out of nowhere. That's a new one for us. That 
[00:06:30]  is a new one. But they're setting up the A-Team when we're on vacation and supposedly all the  bugs are going to be, you know, worked out of the system. O.P. won't be long now. We'll  all be sitting here and going, I can't believe what a well-oiled machine this is. Absolutely.  That's the goal. So we bitch less, we'll be off the premium channel, and then we take  this whole, you know, radio comeback thing to the next stage. Right. The next stage.  There you go. Then eventually we'll be on tour buses, touring the country. I invented the 
[00:07:00]  road show. Oh my God. Wow. If that doesn't reek of desperation. Hell yeah. If that does not  reek of desperation. Hell yeah. You didn't hear that one, Jimmy? No. How he says he's  taking it out on the road. He's going to go from city to city after he gets booted off  of Viacom to promote the fact that he's going to satellite radio. So he's going to get a big  bus, I guess, and get broads and go to a city near you, you know, and do that whole tour 
[00:07:30]  thing. You know, like we've been doing for years and years and years, but I'm sure he  invented it. I invented going to other cities, Robert. Shut up. He's talking about it like  it's a brand new thing. Like taking a radio show somewhere else is a brand new thing.  Radio hosts have been doing it for years. Radio hosts that actually aren't agoraphobic, 
[00:08:00]  I guess. The guy's petrified to go out anywhere. I'm going to love seeing the result of this  one. I think he'll absolutely lose his mind. There's no way this people joke about me being  a germaphobe and not liking people and stuff. Well, you're getting there slowly, but surely  you have changed. Who was hanging out at the bar at the hard rock after everybody else left  drinking a few cocktails with the listeners? Good call. And I felt like the ass when I was  leaving and people were trying to shake my hand. I'm like, no, man, just fish, just fish hanging 
[00:08:30]  out. Because I didn't have any of that. Yeah, I didn't have any of that soap on me.  The gel to put in your hands, the germ gel. It's a known fact. After every appearance or  road show, I ended up getting the flu for three weeks. Because half these guys, they come  up for pictures and stuff. And we've been hanging out with our listeners since day one. Since  the first day Anthony and I started doing radio together, we were out there at bars and stuff  shaking hands. Whether we liked it or not. And taking pictures and banging your girlfriends,  whatever it took. Whatever. To get you to listen to us. Listen. And it never fails. Someone 
[00:09:00]  will always come up with this, the runny nose, wipe their nose before they shake your hand.  Hey, dude. Or they got really cold, clammy, sweaty hands. Or the clammy hand, worse ever.  That's the worst thing someone could slap in your fist, is that nasty, cold, wet hand. Dude,  big fan. Oh! What is that? Get your hooker strangling fingers off him. Jesus Christ. You  can just feel the virus moving on his hand. Guy's been catching trout with his hands in a river. 
[00:09:30]  Right. He came right there to shake yours with it. That cold, wet, slimy hand. Oh, I'm a little  nervous. Yeah, you are. Yeah, just a bit. Ain't ya? Yeek. Just a bit. And because of  your nervousness, now I have to have the flu for three weeks. Thank you. Yeah, I got this  thing on me. This film on my hand. Whatever that is. Yeah, I got to get some of that gel.  I don't leave that awful. You got to walk around and go, hey, how you doing? Wash up. Well, 
[00:10:00]  what happened after our Hard Rock Cafe thing, shaking a lot of hands, kissing a lot of babies,  taking a lot of pictures. Yeah. Soon as we were done, we stayed another hour and a half,  two hours, and I went right to the bathroom, scrubbed up nice. Yeah. Real nice. Now I'm  nice and clean. Doesn't that feel good when you wash up after those things and you know  all those germs went down the drain. You kind of walk out like a doctor coming into the  operating room with your hands up in the air. Oh, yeah. Sterile. And then I forgot that 
[00:10:30]  as I'm leaving, people still want to shake hands and stuff. Yep. So now I look like asshole guy  because I'm like, no, fist, dude, fist. On the way out, fist. Did you hear about the new thing?  You just kind of bumped the elbow. There you go. This is the new cool thing to do. Yeah.  It's Bump Elbow Thursday. Don't touch me, you slimy person. Anyway, it's Monday. It's awful. Hi.  Hi. And wow, the show hits the road again today. Right after the show,  we're jumping on some trains, going down to D.C. for two days. Going down to D.C. Oh, we 
[00:11:00]  love these trips. Woo. Well, we're going to revisit some characters down there. We're  going to be talking to D. Cricket. Yeah. And the Mad Mexican. Yeah. And some other fine  folks from the D.C. office. And the D.C. compound meetings. We have meetings set up.  Have you heard about any of these? I don't know. Yeah. Right. Wait, how can this guy be  on two channels at the same time? Hey. Hey, what's going on here? Hey. Wait a minute. I 
[00:11:30]  know how it's done. What? What happened? I know it's done. Oh, wow. That's like. That's  really weird because his mouth's moving over here, but it's not moving over there and they're  both saying it's exclusive and they're both saying it's live. What? What the hell? Are  we getting tricked? No. How are they doing that? The camera's closer in on one. That's  all the ladies next to him right there. Yeah, but how are they both asking him a question? They  just did the same. They both asked him a question. Oh, maybe one on a five star. Oh,  yeah. Terry Schiavo's husband. Is one taped? Is on two of the morning shows doing a live 
[00:12:00]  interview with Barbara Walters and with what? One is taped. There was a whole article about  this in the Post the other day. Oh, yeah? These two, how ABC and NBC are fighting over the  guests. So one now, what the deal is, one of them gets a tape and they can run it at the  same time. Wow, interesting. How about that? They alternate one tape, one live. These  news channels, man, they're just so competitive. You know, the Schiavo case, oh my God. Let  her go. Let her go and she's not smiling, you idiots. That's part of her condition. That's 
[00:12:30]  how I sit in the XM meetings. I'm like Terry Schiavo. Smiling a little bit. There's just  vacant stare at Elo. Elo whispers to Straylo, I think he's smiling. I think he likes this  idea. Oh my, please pull my feeding tube out. I've had this. I can't take it anymore. It's  just a condition, you idiots. She's not smiling in that bed. She's not smiling? No, she's not  smiling. It looks like she's having a happy time when they're wiping her mouth and everything. 
[00:13:00]  She's like, ah, she smiles. No, no, no, no, no. So you're for pulling the tube out and  letting her just waste away in a couple of weeks? Just let her go. Yeah. I don't think  it should be Congress's decision, though. I guess it should be the family's decision in  the end. Do you think it should be the husband's decision or the parents' decision? Well, that's  pretty weird. I guess that's a toughie, but the government, they should just, you know,  stay the fuck out of it. That's kind of hard, though, if you got the husband saying that he 
[00:13:30]  should say what happens to her and the family saying they should, someone's got to mediate.  Someone has to mediate. And then it just works its way all the way up to now the president's  involved. This is something that was in, you know, local courts and then federal court,  and then all of a sudden it ends up on George Bush's desk. And that's what pisses me off.  The president's a little busy these days. He's got a couple of things. But now this is  the big thing he's going to be focusing on. This is the thing he needs to focus on. This  particular situation. It ties into the right to life thing in every human life, blah, blah, 
[00:14:00]  blah. So, yeah, now he's involved. Let the husband and her family fight it out in like  a, I don't know, a cage match or something. There you go. Just duke it out. I don't know.  It seems to me the parents should definitely have more of a say than the husband does over  what happens to this woman. If the parents want to go on, I guess, paying for her in  the hospital, that's fine. The husband, why does the husband want her to die? Did he say  that he... He said he's honoring her wishes. Oh, her wishes. I'm sure he's just sick of  looking at that face. I know I wouldn't be after 15 years. Close your mouth. We get it. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, God. Jesus. We get it. Wow. Well, he's like, is he remarried or he's with another woman  and then he's had a couple of kids with this other lady. Oh, I didn't know that. Done with her.  Yeah. He's done with her. I don't know if he's officially remarried. But I think if  it is a noble cause that he is indeed fighting for her right to die because that was her wish  and she's got to sit there in that bed staring up and smiling, then I guess, you know, I 
[00:15:00]  don't know. I have no clue what they should do in this situation. Not that I think, you  know, the right to life thing. I think in that case, she's in some pretty bad shape.  You got to err on this. If both people want different things, food in my mouth, I think  you got to err on the side of the family and leave her alive. If the family wants her alive  that bad, it's kind of hard to just go, oh, too bad. Yeah. He was married to her. Now  he's banging someone else, but he'd still like to pull the tube. Yeah. I think as far as who  should have say, it's the parents. But if the husband is then, you know, she said to him 
[00:15:30]  in some moment, you know, look, if I ever end up like that, I want to die. Then it's  kind of, ugh. Well, then it's his word, you know. But then again, she doesn't have a clue  what the hell's going on. And then you get all the kooks coming out of the woodwork  now because they want to save every life. Great. Let's go running around saving every  life. Yeah. And I was telling Anthony in the office today, I'm like, until we have a perfect  society where everyone is just perfect and happy and enjoying their lives, these kooks  have just got to go away. Yeah. There are so many people out there that are living their 
[00:16:00]  lives, know that they're absolutely miserable and there's nothing they can do about it.  They're completely conscious of the situation they're in that could use the help from these  kooks out there. Yeah. Could use the bed space, the medical care, everything. The attention.  Yeah. The attention. The little pick-me-up, you know. Yeah. And, uh, yeah. That's a lot  of resources going on to this woman. All these kooks are going to just worry about this, this 
[00:16:30]  case. If you really care, why don't you just walk around your own freaking neighborhood  and see the people that are just absolutely miserable and there's nothing they can do for  themselves. Yeah. And they're fully aware of their lives stink. Yeah. They wake up every  day going, oh, my life blows. Oh, my body's falling apart. Oh, that. Yeah. And this  woman wakes up. She's happy. She's smiling every day. I bet they pull their feeding to about  she's probably starving, all hungry, and she's probably still smiling. Right. Eh. Let's,  uh, say hi to Pete in Brooklyn. Pete, what's up? Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. Pete. 
[00:17:00]  You know what I do think the government should stay out of it is like with cases like Kevorkian,  where the person themselves is going, look, I want to die and get this over with. Yeah. How about that? And then the  government stepped in and said, well, you can't, I mean, that's a problem. Why is he  in jail? Yeah. He didn't do anything wrong. And how about the way they're, you know, looking  off this woman? Pull the tube out until she just wastes away from lack of food and water  until her organs shut down. Yeah. Let Kevorkian do it. It's over in two seconds. They give, 
[00:17:30]  they give more compassion to these murderers and rapists when they, uh, on death row.  Do you ever see, uh, whose life is it anyway with Richard Dreyfuss? He's an artist. It's  a great film. I hate those depressing movies. It's good though, but it's kind of like this.  Oh, depressing. He's paralyzed in a car accident. I can't hear. Shut up. Hey, Bruce. I can't  hear. I can't hear. Bruce. I can't hear. Bruce. Yes. Oh, you hear us now. I can't hear. Bruce, 
[00:18:00]  can you hear us? No. Fuck out, Sam. Let that motherfucker. That was Bruce Kelly. I just  want to make sure that, uh, you know, we have the phones today because this is a topic that  everyone's talking about. Yes. But go ahead. I'm sorry. I forgot where I was. I know.  Because Bruce had to ruin it for everybody. Oh, Bruce is just trying to be heard though.  I got so many in this country. Let's try Pete again. Pete. I get distracted at a colorful  balloon. I'm like, what? What was I saying? I don't know. It's the most important thing when  it's spilling out of my mouth. And then the second I get this magnet, huh? What? I don't 
[00:18:30]  know. Got ketchup? Got ketchup. Oh, look. Hey, Pete. Pinwheel. Yes, sir. All right.  What do you have? I got the solution for Terry Shriver there. Yeah. Yeah. Put her in the  movies. Oh, the old Bill Hicks bit. Can we find that bit? That's right, sir. Put her in the  movies. The Bill Hicks bit is great. You make the ultimate stunt double for a couple rounds to  the face. There you go. Who's Terry Shriver, sir? I know. Terry Shriver. That's one of the  Kennedys. Yeah, Schwarzenegger's banging her with her mouth open. Yeah. Well, that was 
[00:19:00]  big news. Big news over the weekend. You had to see that face on TV. I didn't know he was  with another girl, though. See, I didn't know that, too, sir. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know the  exact details, because, you know, whatever. I got a life to live. I can't be that bothered.  You can't be bothered. I could skim over the news. Yeah, like these kooks out there that  are going to, you know, waste all their efforts on this when there's so much else going on that  deserves your attention. Huh? The post really does. New casino game card. That's half the 
[00:19:30]  front page of today's post. Oh, yeah, that's the big important thing is their little gambling,  their little try at, try your luck. The papers here in New York, I'm sure your local papers  and your city that you're from out there, hello, do this every so often. They have these  little games of chance that the newspapers do. And I guess the post is doing one based  on poker. And then the Daily News has been doing this scratch and win game, which I pointed 
[00:20:00]  out as being this. The newspaper is so goddamn cheesy around here. You open up the Daily News  to like page two and disguised as a news item is janitor wins in scratch off game. And you're  like, oh, what is this? And you start reading it and you realize it's a fake news story just  telling how this janitor won a scratch, a Daily News scratch off game. So they're using the  newspaper presenting this fake news as headline news here in their newspaper. So that's bugged 
[00:20:30]  me for a couple of months now. And yesterday, I guess, or Saturday, was it? They have these  game cards that come in the Saturday paper. You scratch off the numbers on these game cards  that correspond to the numbers printed in the Daily News that day. And if you get three  of the same numbers amount prize, you win. That's how it works. Like any scratch off game.  Well, people started looking at their numbers and scratching off the tickets. And lo and behold,  a bunch of people ended up $10,000 and $100,000 winners. A shitload of people, including our own 
[00:21:00]  producer here, Eric. He is a $100,000 winner in the scratch off game. What? Yeah. Well, it  seems there was a misprint in the paper. When they printed the numbers you were supposed to  scratch, the newspaper printed number 13, and it was supposed to be number 12. And number  13, in a lot of cases, was the last number you needed to win either $10,000 or $100,000.  So a bunch of people won. The Daily News put out a statement saying it was an error. If 
[00:21:30]  you send in your winning ticket, it goes into a drawing. We'll pull one of the numbers out  and you'll win, I guess, some type of prize. Now, I've been watching the news and I've seen  some people that are complaining that they should be given the money. And a lot of the cameras  for the news stations that are trying to get these angry people ended up in the Bronx in Harlem for  some reason. And they are demanding, I want reparations. They're demanding their $10,000, 
[00:22:00]  $100,000. I want $500,000, motherfucker. How many people won? Quite a few. I don't know a number,  but it was quite a few. Quite a few have won $100,000 each. In one family, a person won and the  grandmother won and they were calling each other, I won, I won $10,000. My God, Lord,  I won too. I was listening to the news and they are angry and they want their God damn  money. They should get it. Why should they get it? Because the paper, hey, look, too bad. 
[00:22:30]  Don't run something like that. You want to pass it off as news? And then it's like a lottery  drawing. Too bad. I agree. I agree. And I would agree, except for if you turn that card over,  it, I mean, specifically has this scenario on the back. And if it happens, you will then  put your ticket in a hat and they will draw it out. It says it on the back. They have no  right to this money. I believe it might be a reading problem. If you flip it over and you 
[00:23:00]  can read the back, perhaps you'll realize that. Did Eric have to apologize for his fuck you  Ope at 12 o'clock in the morning call? I quit. Click. Opie, you are a bum. He's trying  to order a boat with three propellers. Easy come, easy go. I had it and I went with it. Me a 
[00:23:30]  bag of shells. Yeah, here it is. Look, she's crying. They got a woman on TV right now crying.  Because she thought she won. I thought I won. I can't really see. I don't know if  it's the news. Look, I don't know if it's the news's fault, but they really do focus on  the African-American people in cases like this. Not really, man. I have not seen a white person  complaining about this yet. Look, I don't know. I see so many more minorities buying these 
[00:24:00]  things. Yeah. Well, I'm talking about when you go to the store to get the actual tickets,  then whitey. It's simple as that. It is, bro. It's whitey buying, of course. But whenever  I just want to pay for my stupid newspapers and I have to wait, it's never a bunch of white  people in front of me getting their scratch off tickets. Give me a five win for life.  Exactly. I'll take that bingo. I'll take some of the lucky charms. Give me that lucky seven game.  Whatever. I'll see a lucky charm. And I got to scratch it on the counter right in front of you. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah. Can you move? I'm trying to buy something here. And then the idiot with the pencil and  filling out the lotto. Oh, God. I just want to pay for my newspapers. The lotto. Are you  sending in the ticket for the drawing now? Yeah. And what they also said on the news, too, is  to file a claim with the insurance company that backs this up so you do both. Yeah. Dude, they  got a nightmare on their hands. Because you know what's going to happen? This is where it 
[00:25:00]  gets interesting. This is going to be a couple idiots that are going to come forward and go,  hey, I thought I won $100,000, so I bought myself a Mercedes. Oh, I went out. I went on  a shopping spree. Oh, so wait a minute. They're just not paying attention to what it says on  the back of the card. Yeah. They didn't read it. They're not reading the back of the horizon.  But there's going to be some opportunities out there also known as a lawyer that's going  to step forward and go, well, my client thought she really won $100,000 and she put a down payment  on a brand new home and bought a boat and bought this and bought that. Let me see the 
[00:25:30]  ticket. Let me see the ticket. This thing is, yeah. This thing on the back has a disclaimer  and it says if any game card submitted for verification, validation, if it's ineligible, if there was  an error in the event of a printing, production, or other error. Other error. This was an error  of an irregular game or an irregular game card of cards. Neither the Daily News nor Blair, which is the 
[00:26:00]  insurance company, shall have any liability. If due to a printing, production, or other error, more prizes  are awarded for any prize level than were meant to be awarded, a drawing, a random drawing from among all  verified prize cards will be made. That's right there. It says this situation. There was an error in  printing and you're out of luck. Send it in. Hopefully you'll win the drawing. But now you see people 
[00:26:30]  crying on TV. I thought I won. Where's mine? I won a hundred grand forty acres and a mule.  Dude, the phones have exploded. Eric won, as you know, a hundred thousand, right, Eric? Yep. And there's like  three or four people on the line that won as well. Oh, they won also. Right. Here's another  hundred thousand dollar winner. Terry Schiavo won, I heard. She smiled and everything. Now she's all depressed. 
[00:27:00]  A hundred grand. I can't believe someone won a hundred grand. Oh, hey. Oh, hey. Oh, they're ripping us off.  Oh, they're ripping us off. Oh, hey. Ho, ho, ho. Here. Send me up with this. There you go.  Ira, what's up? Ira. It's funny. You got to, you got to picture this. You wake up on a Saturday or  Sunday morning. Yeah. And I'm going through and I'm scratching off the numbers and I check it the  first time and it says I won a hundred grand. Oh boy. So then what do you do? You go and you do it  again. You just look at everything again and you say, did I do the right numbers? Did I do this? Oh my 
[00:27:30]  God. That's really, that is really bad. Now I don't want to wake up the wife. I don't  want to wake up the kids. I just want to sit there and look for a while because I'm sitting  there going, I can't be this stupid. Right. Make absolutely sure. So I'm sitting there one  more time. I take a look at it. So now I'm walking around the house. I go, this can't be,  it doesn't happen to me. So 10 minutes later, before I do anything, my friend calls, we played  hold them the night before. Yeah. And we were talking about it because we're both an advertiser.  And he goes, you're not going to believe this, but I won 50,000 bucks. I go, well, you're 
[00:28:00]  not going to believe this. Something is bullshit because there's no way we could both win.  Yeah. It's impossible. Yeah. But can you imagine that feeling you get for 10, 15 minutes?  Oh, you had, you, dude, were you thinking about what you can do with that money?  Well, you know what? I really never believed it. Right. I'm just sitting there going, it's  not going to hit the lottery. You see the numbers. It's, I just never believed it.  I figured something was going to happen. And that's why a lawyer will step forward.  Now I got the angle. What's the angle? I thought I won 100,000. I'm all excited. I'm  all freaked out. And now I'm depressed because I learned that I didn't actually win the 100,000. 
[00:28:30]  Now I'm in massive depression. I'm in massive depression. I need meds. I'm seeing a doctor.  Everyone will send in the cards and everyone will get $25 if they get that much.  But what about you? Aren't you going to file a suit? Don't you want yours?  Well, I'm going to submit and whatever lawyer picks up the names and if they, you know,  if they file a class action, I'll go in on it. Aren't you going to protest?  No, I don't think I got time to sit there and protest. I saw some protesting going on.  Not that 100,000 is not worth it. Don't get me wrong, but I mean, it's not going to, you  know, really change my life that much. Did you actually feel better than your friend did 
[00:29:00]  because you didn't win 100,000 and he only didn't win 50? Were you making fun of him?  No, we were just sitting there going, you know, we must be the two biggest schmucks in the world.  That's funny.  Very good. Yeah, it kind of brought it home when he was saying you scratch it, you look,  and you don't know that there's been an error, so you're looking at the card, looking at the paper,  really thinking you won.  But you know what they did wrong? The one thing they did do wrong that I saw on TV,  and I think these people were right down in Brooklyn and the Bronx, 
[00:29:30]  is they had all day to just release something to the news stations.  So that these people that really need, I mean, everybody could use 100,000, don't get me wrong.  Sure.  But I mean, these people that could really use it to change their life, they couldn't know about it yesterday.  They didn't have to wait for the daily news to come out.  Yeah, they didn't, when did they inform people? Today?  They didn't inform anybody until they put it in the papers, Sunday morning's papers.  Jesus, wow.  They had all day Saturday, they knew they screwed up.  Right.  And they didn't go to any news station because they didn't want to admit the mistake.  Jesus.  Yeah, they were going to just probably try to hide. 
[00:30:00]  I can't believe they really thought it would just blow over.  You know who doesn't care about 100 grand, though? Opie.  Yeah.  They don't care.  That's nothing to him.  That's really nothing.  Well, if I had you guys' money.  He spends that on a dresser.  Yeah.  All right, guys, thanks.  All right, thank you.  Let's go to Kyle in Jersey, another $100,000 winner.  All right, congratulations, Kyle.  Hey.  What are you going to do with all the money?  No, I didn't win it.  My girlfriend's father won it.  Oh.  And he's sitting there, he looks at it, he reads the paper the next day, I'm sitting there with 
[00:30:30]  him, and literally a tear comes out of his eye.  A 75-year-old man.  I just couldn't believe that this was all a lie, and that this wasn't true.  He was preparing for a getaway cruise, and just literally put his head on the table for  20 minutes.  I thought the dude was dead.  Oh, man.  Fushing out.  Yeah.  All right, thank you.  Poor people.  You've got to figure that, emotionally, that could get to you better.  Yeah.  You could really use the money.  Good.  All of a sudden you scratch, and you see that money, and all your problems are solved in  like one instant. 
[00:31:00]  Well, Anthony, this reminds me of the time you and I gave away $100,000.  Well, it was $100,000.  Same thing.  $100,000.  That's right.  Oh, very different thing, Jimmy.  In this context.  Yes.  We were very smart.  If we said $100,000, we'd have been in big trouble.  We would have got sued, but we said $100,000.  You're right, Anthony.  You're absolutely right.  Exactly.  And this is the winner of our $100,000 contest.  Ooh.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, it's Craig from Waltham. 
[00:31:30]  Hey, Craig, guess what?  Oh, did I win?  You are the 107th caller.  No way!  He did it!  Tell me, I won!  I won!  I won!  You're kidding, right?  107th.  107th.  Oh, wow!  107th caller.  Congratulations.  100 grand!  Oh, my God!  You just won 100 grand, bro.  Oh, Jesus.  Do you know what I want to do with that?  What are you going to do with 100 grand?  Oh, man.  The first thing.  I have this old...  Oh, I cannot...  Jesus.  I've got to calm...  Calm down.  Calm yourself. 
[00:32:00]  I am the winner!  I'm the winner!  Well, what are you going to do with 100 grand, bro?  I got this...  Oh, man.  I got this box for a truck.  I've got to get a new one.  A new truck.  Oh, that...  Wait, wait, dude.  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  What?  How are you going to do that with a candy bar?  We just...  We just gave you a 100 grand candy bar.  What do you...  What do you mean?  We gave away 100 grand.  It's a...  It's a candy bar, bro.  Congratulations.  What?  You just won a candy bar.  Hey!  What the f***?  I've been listening to f***ing radio for like three hours, man. 
[00:32:30]  You said 100 grand!  Yeah, 100 grand.  We gave you a candy bar.  That's a candy bar.  Congratulations, buddy buddy!  You guys are a bunch of d***s!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Congratulations, man!  Uh-oh.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the Oaday virus.  They had owned a chimp, this couple.  But the chimp had bitten off somebody's thumb, so they had to get rid of it.  So they gave it to this animal sanctuary. 
[00:33:00]  Well, they went to visit the chimp because it was the chimp's birthday.  So they brought the chimp a birthday cake.  And they're standing around trying to, I guess, give this chimp the birthday cake.  And some other chimps, now whether they were in a cage and got out of the cage or they  weren't in the cage, I have no idea.  I haven't been able to get that straight from what I've read.  But these chimps attacked the couple.  And at first they bit one of the woman's fingers. 
[00:33:30]  And then the man pushed his wife or this woman out of the way.  And the chimps just attacked this guy mercilessly.  I mean they fucked him up big time.  The damage report, one was at his head, one was at his foot.  But all the time he was trying to reason with them.  Hey, look, chimps, could you not rip my face off?  What kind of reasoning?  Came around and chomped off my thumb. 
[00:34:00]  The male chimp, the wife, said,  My husband must have realized we were in deep trouble because he pushed me backwards.  At that time they both went for him.  So he must have seen him go for the woman and thought it was some kind of competition.  Lost all the fingers from both his hands.  Dude, they chewed off every finger that he owned.  And this isn't reattach his fingers stuff.  You know those chimps just like mashed his fingers.  Ripped an eye out of his socket, so that's gone. 
[00:34:30]  Ripped off his nose, a cheek, his lips, and part of his buttocks in the attack.  They just started eating ass.  And they were tugging on his genitals.  Why couldn't they put that...  Remember the movie Planet of the Apes?  Yeah, of course.  This sounds like a scene that should have been in the movie.  Yeah, where's the nice...  You know, even those apes, they were vicious and stuff, but at least, you know, all they did was... 
[00:35:00]  You cut out his brain, you bloody baboon.  Look at you.  You ripped off his fingers, lips, and buttocks, cheeks.  Damn you.  Somebody pissed this champ off.  Those things...  How do you reason with that?  To the point of he went to...  I mean, did they not feed him for about six months?  Probably he was pissed off that they threw him in this animal preserve many years ago.  Yeah.  And he's just been waiting and waiting.  Just waiting.  Waiting.  That son of a bitch will come back. 
[00:35:30]  I know his face.  He'll come back.  One day.  Is this the son...  Guys, guys, this is the son of a bitch that put me here.  This is the guy...  I bit off one finger.  Right.  And this is the guy that put me here.  This is the guy I've been telling you about.  Here he comes, the cave selfish.  That's our chance.  You bite his fingers off, I'm gonna bite his genitals and his butter.  He said I'd go away.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  I'm doing the best that I've made.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  Now, go away.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  Now, go away.  I'm doing the best I ever did. 
[00:36:00]  Now, go away.  Let's go right back to the phones.  There's a doctor on the line from New York City.  It's Jay.  Jay, what's up, buddy?  Hey, how you doing?  You're a doctor?  Yeah, man.  Listen, a patient of mine came in yesterday.  He just complained a little bit of chest pain. 
[00:36:30]  He didn't come in for that element, actually.  But he did relate to me that he lost the lottery.  He read about it in the paper and just started complaining about chest pain.  So we gave him a nitroglycerin and checked his EKG.  He was okay.  But he's the next teacher.  And all these teachers, I tell you, when they get to be about 40,  they just go nuts and get depressed.  And this just sent him over the edge.  I could see him coming back later on for a little extra.  Wait, so the guy claimed...  What's that?  The guy claimed that he won this Daily News scratch-off game 
[00:37:00]  and then realized he didn't win, so he came in for chest pains?  Yeah.  Well, you know, he was coming in anyway.  But then he started complaining about his chest pain.  I didn't even know about the lottery thing.  Mark my word, though, dude.  Mark my word.  Someone's going to come forward and say this caused some stress  and now they've got problems and that's why they're going to sue.  And you'll see.  It's only a matter of time, right?  Okay, guys.  Bunch it out.  Enjoying the show.  All right.  Thank you.  Sean in Rockland.  What's up, Sean?  What's up, guys?  Hey. 
[00:37:30]  What about the poor son of a bitch that went to his paper on Saturday morning  and had 12, thought he lost and threw out the ticket?  Oh.  And there's another angle.  Another angle.  Wow.  They said it was supposed to be 12 instead of 13.  What about the guy who might have won if he had scratched off the well?  There are people out there that won.  Yeah.  No idea because, yeah, they do what most of us do.  Ah, this is a loser and just throw it away.  Throw it away.  And you're not really, well, maybe some of them, you know,  had their numbers written down or whatever, but.  There's a case in court right now about this lottery guy had bought a lottery ticket, 
[00:38:00]  scratched it off, or it wasn't a scratch off ticket, it was like a lotto ticket,  went to the guy at the register to check it.  And the guy said, no, this isn't a $50 winner or something like that.  I give him the ticket back and the guy threw it away.  The woman grabbed the ticket out of the trash and had it checked at some other place  and it was a $100,000 winner.  So now she got the money because the ticket's in her possession and they're filing suit against 
[00:38:30]  the store and the lottery commission and everything else because the guy said it wasn't a $50,  the guy had only checked it to see if it was a $50 winner or something like that  and it turned out to be a lot more.  And oops, that one's going to be in court.  Oops.  And they had to give it to the woman.  The thing about the lottery, if you have the ticket, that's it.  You're the guy with the ticket.  You win.  It's really hard to fight that if you don't actually have possession of the ticket.  I don't believe it's a misprint either.  If you have one number to get right, how do you print that wrong when you know people  are thinking they win $100,000? 
[00:39:00]  How do you not do that correctly?  Yeah, that's the one number you really got to watch.  I don't buy it.  I'm sorry.  I totally buy it.  Really?  It's incompetence.  It sounds like a publicity stunt.  It could be a stunt.  They could have worked it through and they hadn't gone.  Oh, all right.  You know something?  We're all talking about it.  Let's keep our minds open here a little bit.  Yeah, it's all right now.  They could have said, you know, we have it on the back.  We wrote that we have a disclaimer.  And the disclaimer says this situation exactly.  Oh.  It's kind of a way to drum up some, and I wouldn't put it past these scumbag rags. 
[00:39:30]  Then again, it's really negative publicity though.  It's really awful publicity.  It's not sex in a church publicity.  Well, no, it's not that good.  All right.  Let's change topics again.  Let's go to Tennessee.  Ralph, what's up?  Hey, about the Terry Schiavo thing?  Yeah.  A lot of the talk radio is reporting that he went in court, you know, before.  He said, oh, he's going to have to take care of his wife.  I guess it's a malpractice lawsuit or something.  He got a boatload of money, and as soon as the check cleared, he said, oh, my wife wouldn't 
[00:40:00]  want to live in this condition.  We've got to take the feeding tube out.  Hmm.  So she gets a bunch of money because there was some kind of malpractice.  The settlement comes in, the husband takes the money, and now you would actually have  to use that money to keep her and care for her.  All right.  Hey, it's a lot cheaper just to get a motorboat, and you go out of Modesto and splash as she  smiles.  You see through the green, ripply haze, that smile just drifting away like Jack in Titanic. 
[00:40:30]  But why a motorboat?  You can just sit her in the backyard and just face her like with a little few leaves around  her and no one will even notice.  Wow.  All right.  Well, that does some kind of motive there.  Do we lose this guy?  Do we lose this guy?  Yeah, we lost him.  All right.  Boy, would that smile irritate me.  Try to save your money and go out and buy a nice Jaguar, but you've got to go in there  and look at old toothy gums. 
[00:41:00]  Jesus.  Old happy gal.  Yeah.  She's the perfect person to try your comedy material on.  Two Jews walking to a bar.  Dumb smile.  I'll keep that.  Look at that.  Hey, Lenny.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  I just wanted to call up and say that my aunt actually won like a million dollars on one  of them scratch offs.  It was like the Millennium Series.  And she actually threw it in the garbage because she scratched off one of the winning 
[00:41:30]  spaces and it was supposed to be just one and she thought she had to match three of  them.  So she threw it in the garbage.  How do you not kill yourself at that point?  Wow.  Yeah, I know.  We went back to that place and we were going through the trash can trying to offer people  money to help us out and it just didn't work.  Hey, listen.  Norton, what you guys?  Norton, are you there?  I'm right here, mister.  Oh.  Must have been disconnected.  He did kind of get you.  I think you got you, bro.  You got you good, too. 
[00:42:00]  Alright.  I don't know.  Hawk?  You're all wanting and stuff.  Like, oh, I'm important.  No.  He wants to talk to me personally.  I thought maybe he wanted to ask some questions about, you know, I don't know.  I don't know.  Hey, where's Ben?  Ben ran into Matt Lauer over the weekend.  It's a quick, funny little story.  Yeah.  What are we doing?  Yeah, if you could get that.  What are we doing?  On a certain website, I don't want it to be flooded.  Uh-huh.  Apparently, there might be audio, Shiavo audio, responding to her father on Friday immediately  following the removal of her feeding tube.  I tried to get that the other day.  I tried to get that, too.  Yeah? 
[00:42:30]  Audio.  It came out like one of those pages that won't open, like an error page.  Really?  It was getting pounded at the time.  Yeah, it was probably getting pounded.  It probably is now, too.  Oh, well.  I think the Republicans are on the right side of this one.  If that's true about the husband...  Yeah.  It's kind of tough to tell the family, look.  Tough titty.  A little motivation there, yeah.  There's some motivation there to get her out of the picture, then, for the guy.  If the family was going, look, he's right, she wants to be put to whatever, put to sleep.  She wants to be put down because she has a broken leg.  Put down.  You know, then it's one thing, but...  She's a smiling, fleshy, scratch-off ticket for that guy. 
[00:43:00]  That's right.  I won.  There's a 12 behind them there gums.  I win.  Fleshy scratch-off.  Oh, I'm the winner.  There he is, Ben.  You had a little celebrity sighting over the weekend?  I actually had two.  Yeah?  Ben called me.  What day was that?  I had the chick from the OC watch right by me.  He called me Saturday and told me everyone he ran into this weekend.  Oh, there was one, yeah, and then there was the one D-list celebrity that I told you about 
[00:43:30]  that got this ugly these days.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that doesn't matter.  It's not in Ralph and I'll tell you up there.  But, no, the chick from the OC, the real hot chick with her oil heiress boyfriend.  The OC.  The real, what's her, Mish Bart?  Yeah, she's hot.  She walked by him.  No, but Matt Lauer was sitting having lunch at a sushi place in Soho and this little kid  starts playing with the back of my hair because they're sitting behind me and I turn around  and it's Matt Lauer like, stop playing with his hair.  He's trying to eat lunch.  Oh, my God.  That's hilarious.  Stop neatening his hair.  Right.  He's got more hair, though, in person. 
[00:44:00]  Just watch him on TV.  He's got a lot more hair, it looks like.  I think it's all that is.  That's just in.  Matt Lauer's kid missing.  I'll look for him.  He's in there somewhere.  The little boy, you know why he was touching it?  Because he thought it was the nest he saw on TV that those hawks were in on Fifth Avenue.  Mama, see birds.  That would be funny.  That would be fun to play with, you know.  I'd love to run my fingers through Ben's hair.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  You're good.  I dare you.  Hey.  Oh, that's cool. 
[00:44:30]  Got a FedEx warm.  Hey.  Hey.  All right.  Matt Lauer and his child.  There you go.  Playing with Ben's hair.  I went and saw Wheeze over the weekend.  Oh, yeah?  How's he doing?  It's starting to take effect now.  I mean, the radiation is taking hold now.  He's six or seven treatments in, so.  Already it's starting to.  Oh, man.  It's going to be a very interesting thing here.  You know, my mentor in the business, he's in New York City getting radiation for a crazy  whacked out rare form of cancer in his, I don't know, deep in his nasal passage. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, God.  It's something they usually see only in Asian countries, so he's starting to think maybe  when he was doing the Vietnam thing, the Agent Orange, but, you know, he doesn't know  for sure.  The Vietnam thing.  The Vietnam thing.  It's like something you chose to do, like a vacation.  Well, he did.  He actually chose to go back.  Yeah.  He didn't have to.  One of those crazy guys.  He went back for another tour.  He, you know, and he openly admits, look, you know, I know there's a lot of guys out  there that came back and they're, they were fucked up and all this.  He goes, but you know what?  I had a really good time over there. 
[00:45:30]  Was he in the shit?  And he hates to admit that because he knows a lot of guys that are suffering, but yeah,  he was in the shit.  Yeah.  Not just like a clerk.  Oh, no.  I like those guys.  Yeah.  I was over in the NOM.  He was like a clerk at the motor pool.  No.  What's that?  What was that movie?  When we were soldiers or when?  What was that one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bush or whatever.  Right.  Supposedly, like, Wheeze was the guys that came in to take over that company after that  whole battle or whatever.  I guess he did. 
[00:46:00]  No, he saw a lot of shit.  So, he's way on the side getting his radiation treatment.  He was doing his radio show, but now he's down to only like 15 minutes a day.  They just don't want him freaking doing, you know, much of anything.  Because the radiation he's getting for this tumor, it's pretty much going to dry up all  his saliva in his mouth, which is going to cause all sorts of fucked up problems,  you know, possibly losing teeth and, you know, he's at the stage now where, you know, when  you get sick and you get that gulp at night and you can't sleep because all night long  your throat's a little dry and you're gulping and gulping and you just, you know, that's 
[00:46:30]  happening already.  Well, water won't help or it's just...  Well, I'm not a doctor.  He's got all sorts of stuff they're trying to do, this and that.  And he's prone to all sorts of sores in his mouth, so he has to keep his mouth clean.  And he has to use a toothbrush that is like, almost like cotton, almost, as, you know, soft  as possible.  But anyway, so I mean...  Jeez.  I know.  It just blows, dude.  He's got 33 treatments.  He's only six or seven in and it's already, you know, some stuff is starting to happen already. 
[00:47:00]  But anyway, the point of the story, you know the other day we were talking about the telescopes  and stuff?  Yeah, in the city.  In the city?  Yeah.  So I was telling Wheeze, you know, because we're really good friends, I was telling him  how we revisited the whole thing where a lot of people in New York have telescopes and  the reason I brought up his apartment that he's staying in overlooks some great shit.  Yeah.  Really good stuff.  So I'm like, Wheeze, you've got to get a telescope, man.  So I guess, I mean, his listeners up there in Rochester are sending him stuff like crazy 
[00:47:30]  and I go over there Saturday just to say hi and see how he's doing, and there's the  telescope all set up and ready to go.  Really?  Peering out, doing a little peeping?  We were rocking the telescope, yeah.  There was like a lady in her upper 40s like sun tanning in some kind of black lingerie.  Really?  That was the Mac Daddy of...  Sun tanning, it's been 35 degrees.  Saturday it was like maybe 40, it was a nice...  Ooh, bombing.  I know, 40, 45 in the morning, but it was nice and sunny, so I don't know, we're thinking  maybe, I don't know.  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  But somehow it felt warm on her terrace, because she's out there with her coffee and her black  little negligee.  Yeah.  Just kind of tanning for like an hour, and we're just watching her, and then another  girl comes out, then we're trying to figure out if there's some kind of lesbian couple.  Nice.  But no action happened there.  No.  That was the Mac Daddy, because then you get the other awful stuff.  There was like some gay guy pruning his plants on his terrace, and what else did we see?  Ooh.  People just cleaning their windows, things like that, but...  Yeah, you know, it's like fishing. 
[00:48:30]  You never know.  But the telescope thing is awesome.  And then you...  He overlooks like another building with a lot of apartments, and you can see other people's  telescopes looking at you.  Of course.  People know.  They know how to entertain themselves when you live in an apartment building like that.  I got to give the Gooch from Cleveland credit for his line.  Yeah.  He writes, Dear Terry Schiavo, I hope you get better and your feeding tube goes back in  you soon.  Your grandson, Frank. 
[00:49:00]  That is really funny, Gooch.  Very nice.  Your grandson, Frank.  Three days without the tube and she's still alive.  But anyway, that's the Wheeze update, because a lot of people have been emailing me personally  about it, and he's doing alright so far.  And there's a link on all our websites, a website called kickcancersass.com, because 
[00:49:30]  Wheeze is trying to do a good thing and actually raise money while he goes through this hell and  back, so...  How many a week does he have to get treatments?  Well, he has to do 33.  How many?  Is it like one a week?  No, it's every day except the weekends, I think.  So do the math, you know, it's about six weeks, I guess, a little more maybe.  Wow.  No, he'll be in New York for a long time, so...  Because of NASA, sooner or later they're going to have those little pills you eat.  I'm telling you, a little, what they call it, micro and macro things that are just going  to go in there and get it for you before it even starts.  A little robot in there? 
[00:50:00]  They're working on that because the people want to go to Mars, so they have to have some  kind of three years of medical treatment.  You have to go ask to Mars.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So hopefully.  You can swallow something.  It's got like all kinds of things in it.  A little camera.  Well, they already have that.  Bleep bleep bleep.  I've already seen that.  Swallow pictures.  Yeah, I saw the camera one, yeah.  And sends them out to your call or whatever?  He was showing me pictures of his treatment because they put this really tight mesh mask  on him and pin him down to a table because he can't move, obviously.  You know, you don't want to move at all when you're getting the radiation. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  You're getting a little laughter.  No.  Howdy, Quaid.  Kids go to Mars.  Howdy, Quaid.  And, yeah, they strap him down really tight and, you know, he's claustrophobic to begin  with and that's how they do the thing.  But he was showing me the pictures and it looked like something out of a horror film.  Really, really creepy.  But, anyway, there's the update.  Kickcancersass.com.  Yes, Jimmy.  But if it goes well and he does his treatments and stuff, he'll be fine afterwards.  He'll get all the saliva back and all that stuff.  Yeah, I guess, you know. 
[00:51:00]  I guess.  It's going to be tough, you know.  The treatment for this form of cancer and where it is, it's a tough one.  But, supposedly, it'll be alright if he can get through the whole damn thing.  You should go to Dr. Kennedy.  Oh, but, anyway, we were doing that, we were checking out, trying to find broads with a  telescope and he's doing, dude, he's pokering his ass off.  Oh, really?  And he wants you to go play poker with him.  A little poker.  Before he, I mean, it's going to get to a point he's not going to be leaving the apartment  at all, but he's still kind of in that stage where he's getting out a little bit.  Yeah.  And he's playing in poker tournaments all over Manhattan. 
[00:51:30]  I don't want to get to.  And then he's doing the video poker online now.  I'm not that good.  Anything to, you know, get a distraction.  I was playing all weekend, really.  He was out 900 large.  What?  On Friday night.  Wait, 900,000?  No, no, no.  Oh, oof.  900 large.  He meant 900 large.  That's oof.  That doesn't know the right expression.  He dropped 900k.  What?  Yeah, you're right, 900.  Oh, wow.  900 in a poker tournament Friday night.  I was doing a lot of what they call the sit-and-go games online where it's a little mini tournament 
[00:52:00]  at a table.  Nobody can come in after the game starts, and you kind of have to eliminate everybody  at the table.  You won a couple of those.  You get in, you buy.  I was in the $10 buy-in table.  It costs you $10 to get in, and then if you win, you win $50.  Come in second, you win $30.  Third, you win $20.  And then anybody under that wins nothing.  Mm-hmm.  And, yeah, I was in the money quite a few times.  And then a few times, just make those stupid rookie mistakes where you just fall in love 
[00:52:30]  with your stupid hand.  You got, like, ace-king.  You bet it big.  You know, you raise.  Somebody else sees the raise, and then you just can't leave it alone.  The flop comes out.  You got nothing, and you're still hitting it, hoping, chasing the cards, hoping something  comes up.  Yeah, right up to the ages.  All right, I'm pot committed.  And then you got to put more money in.  Just stupid rookie mistakes.  You should play in, like, some live tournaments.  Yeah.  A little more online. 
[00:53:00]  They're popping up all over the place now.  A little more online.  Believe me, even I know I'm getting better at it.  And then one guy, I'm playing over the weekend, and some guy takes me for a lot in one hand.  And I said, nice hand, you know, and he goes, eh, thanks.  Love the show.  Oh, really?  I'm like, oh, I just made a dope-ass mistake in front of a listener.  I'm surprised he isn't calling up, talking about what an ass I am and how bad I play.  Yeah.  The guy's great. 
[00:53:30]  He just goes on and gives away money to people.  Fantastic.  And then Saturday night I went to Caroline's and I saw Mitch Hedberg, who wants to do the  show today, which is weird because we were trying to get him on the show Friday.  I went backstage after the show to give him props, and he was freaking out.  He's like, dude, I want to do you and Anthony's show, man.  Yeah.  And I don't know what the deal was with that, but I guess he might stop in today.  I told him what to do, and we, you know, we exchanged numbers, so we'll see what happens.  Yeah.  Because we have Ozzy coming in and Rob Halford today as well, so.  Ozzy, Oz. 
[00:54:00]  I mean, what's the deal with Mitch Hedberg?  What's the inside scoop on this guy?  Because I'm thinking, I'm starting to think that a lot of it is an act.  Because backstage he was not completely normal, but a lot more normal than he was on stage,  and then I watched him kind of cross the street with his friend outside Caroline's,  and I'm thinking, wow, man, are we all being taken?  Because if you know about Mitch Hedberg, he basically goes up there as a major, like, stoner.  Yeah.  And, like, he can barely stand up and he does, like, I don't want to insult the guy.  I mean, I think his act is very original. 
[00:54:30]  You know, it's sort of a Stephen Wright meets kind of like early Carlin meets.  He's got his own thing going on, I guess, but it's a lot of one-liner jokes, basically,  and observational humor.  Yeah.  His writing is great, though.  I mean, he comes from a really weird angle.  Like, he's never a traditional punchline, which makes it very interesting.  Yeah.  He's really interesting and he's a very funny guy.  Yeah.  But, yeah, I don't know.  I mean, I haven't seen Mitch in a long time since the Comedy Cellar.  He used to come in to work a lot, and he was always pretty normal when I would see him,  but you never know.  There's the rumors that he gets really high.  Yeah, because Saturday night, you know, he has two drinks on stage and all of a sudden 
[00:55:00]  one drink just crashes to the floor.  And then later on in the set, he decides just to lay down on the stage and do a few jokes  that way.  And then he sits with the audience for a little while and just kind of gives them the mic like  he's too fucked up to continue.  How did he go over?  Well, I actually ended up going Friday and Saturday because I had nothing to do with  Friday and Eric winning.  He had an extra ticket.  Friday kind of, it was shaky at best, but Saturday was a lot better.  A lot better.  It was shaky at Friday. 
[00:55:30]  It's kind of good to hear that a guy, because Mitch draws all over the country.  Dude, it was...  It was standing room only.  It was unbelievable how packed it was.  And then he takes out like an old man pipe, you know, the kind where you kind of hold  it like...  You know what I mean, right?  Almost like a Sherlock Holmes pipe.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then he was doing like one hitters on stage during the show.  You gotta love that.  But I don't know what was in the pipe, because someone goes, hey, what's in the pipe?  And Mitch goes, wouldn't you like to know?  So now I'm like curious about this guy.  I'm wondering if it's an act or if it's... 
[00:56:00]  Or if he does get fucked up, but not as fucked up as it seems, you know?  Because there was rumors that he was on heroin, and he was doing it so much that he had gangrene  in his leg.  Yeah, that was a rumor.  I don't know if it was true.  I heard that it was true.  But again, in any business, the rumors get distorted just like they do everywhere else.  So that could just be bullshit, too.  But then is he smart enough to know these rumors are out there and then plays off them?  You know?  Is he doing sort of like an Andy Kaufman type thing?  Maybe.  I'm really interested in this guy's story now.  I believe he missed dates on the Tell Lewis Black thing, but again, that could have been 
[00:56:30]  for other reasons, too.  Yeah.  If I remember correctly.  I mean, he does look really messed up when he's on that stage.  Strung out.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Got a little thing going for him.  Yeah.  Can we place Mitch Hedberg into break, maybe?  How did your gigs go down there in Florida, Jimmy?  It was good.  I mean, small crowds, but again, you definitely started to feel the presence.  And I never drew in West Palm before.  So I was happy.  I wish there was more people, but I had to switch that last date from the Sunday to the 
[00:57:00]  Thursday, which kind of screwed a lot of people up.  Once we're off the premium, opens up the show to a lot more people.  It's starting.  Did you hear some of the promos for us coming off the premium?  No.  They're announcing April 11th.  Why?  Yeah.  See...  Eric knows the answer to this?  You know the answer?  Because I'm listening and thinking, we're going off the premium April 2nd.  And what we're doing is playing a lot of best of stuff with us introing them. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  This is a lot different than all those other times we took vacation.  Yeah.  It's not just throwing crap at you and just hoping you enjoy it a second or third time  around.  And I sitting down and Jimmy introing a lot of these bits.  And then we had Bruce Kelly come up.  He interviewed a bunch of people.  So it's going to be a lot of new material.  A lot of new stuff.  Within the best of.  We have the best of in there because we want some of the new listeners that are brand new  to the show because they didn't pay for us.  They're just kind of on the platform. 
[00:58:00]  We want to get them kind of caught up so they can kind of get a feel for what we're  all about.  But now they're promoing it.  So.  I think I got the promo.  Those listeners, why won't, why won't you promote the fact that we're off premium  April 2nd so they could listen and get caught up even though we're not live.  We're, I listened to this and I was like, what the.  Here's the promo.  I've just been handed an urgent and horrifying news story.  Beginning April 11th, the Opie and Anthony show will no longer be a premium service. 
[00:58:30]  Thank effing God.  Opie.  We're brilliant broadcasters.  Anthony.  I still find the most immature things funny.  And little Jimmy Norton.  Every time you just start to enjoy their voices, I pipe in and spoil the whole thing  for you.  You'll hear them and the rest of the Opie and Anthony show beginning Monday, April  11th as part of your basic XM subscription.  Well, I'm very happy for you.  First of all, let me acknowledge that's a very good piece.  Steve, are you?  Yeah.  Fantastic, funny.  Very good piece. 
[00:59:00]  Gets the point across big time.  But why April 11th?  April 11th.  Because the initial piece of email I got from, I might have been from Kevin down in  DC, but now I'm not even sure because I've cut so many of these effing promos in the  last two weeks, said April 11th.  And I think the decision was the ones we run in channel are going to say April 11th.  The ones we run on the non-202 or the non-XL channels are going to say April 2nd because  basically we're coming back live April 11th on a non-premium.  Because everything else is worse stuff.  It was confusing. 
[00:59:30]  I'm sure you cleared that up.  I'm more confused than ever.  Yeah, I know.  Are the April 2nd ones running on the rest of it?  Yeah.  Can we hear one of those?  What?  Yeah, why in that promo?  Ah, whatever.  Yeah.  I really need to just program this channel.  I think we should.  There's a bunch of dummies that don't know what they're doing.  Well, I think Steve did a nice job on that one.  No, I'm not saying Steve.  He's doing what he's told and with copying stuff.  That promo doesn't make sense whatsoever.  If you're going to go down that route, then it should be O&A on vacation. 
[01:00:00]  They're off the premium now and you get to hear them live starting April 11th.  Right.  Yeah.  That's the promo.  Uh-huh.  Oh, my God.  This is like programming 101.  I did a better job programming my college radio station when I was freaking 18, 19 years old.  Ooh.  You got it?  Let's hear this.  The first of the Opie and Anthony show.  This is what's so funny.  People just assume we just hang out all the time. 
[01:00:30]  I haven't been to Anthony's new place on Long Island.  What?  You were there once.  No, I wasn't.  When I first moved there.  No.  Did you stop by?  No.  Wow.  Did you stop by?  No.  Are you cheating on me with another radio DJ?  Oh, well, no.  Did you just put your foot in your mouth?  Oh.  No.  What radio station does he work for?  I could have sworn you are.  Is he one of those morning zoo guys?  I found this under your bed.  What is this?  What is this? 
[01:01:00]  Wacky accoutrements.  The Opie and Anthony show live from 7 to 11 a.m. with replays throughout the day on XM 202.  Starting on April 2nd, the Opie and Anthony show will no longer be a premium service and will be available to all XM subscribers.  Wow.  Thank you, Steve.  You're welcome.  The little tag on the end of it.  Yeah.  So that's running on like the news and non-XL channels.  Right.  But everything we run on 202 says April 11th because that's when we actually return live off the premium for some reason. 
[01:01:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  That's just stupid.  It really is stupid.  Just be the same one, right?  On all of them.  April 2nd.  Because then there's a lot of people out there that have the entire XM nation, let's just call, and they're hearing April 2nd, April 11th.  It's just dumb.  Dumb overthinking programming.  April 2nd, I think is the date.  I saw Mitch in Buffalo two months back and he was like wasted and had to read his jokes out of a book. 
[01:02:00]  That's pretty funny.  He does look down at the book, too.  That's pretty funny.  I'm really interested in this guy.  I don't know.  I'm surprised I haven't seen him before now.  I think it's a bit of both.  I've been hearing about Mitch for years.  I've known him for a while.  And I think it's a bit of both.  I think he parties and gets high and I think he's just learned to use it.  And, you know, it just doesn't hurt him on stage.  DJ, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey.  I was listening to ESPN radio.  I believe it was the 80s station last week and they actually had the 11th one also. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, they were playing the 11th promo.  Yeah.  And I didn't hear the second.  I was really confused because I've been on board with you guys since the beginning.  And they said starting the 11th, you know, you'll no longer be charged.  You know, whatever the promo says.  Oh, boy.  So, yeah, I didn't hear the second.  I was kind of confused, too, because I know everything else is the second.  Oh, God.  Yeah, you want people to hear the best ofs because that's like all good stuff that's  just been kind of...  Yeah.  You just tell it how it is. 
[01:03:00]  We're off the premium channel April 2nd.  Here's some crap to get you caught up.  And they'll be back live April 11th.  Boom.  End of promo.  Our channel and every other...  Pew, pew, pew.  And you run it on every other channel.  Yep.  It's the first thing you learn when programming radio.  It has to be very simple and to the point.  Keep it simple.  You have to keep it simple.  So, to have two different dates and this and that doesn't make sense.  April 2nd, the boys are now off the premium channel.  Here's some worst of.  Here's, I don't know, Open Anthony 101 to get you caught up if you're a new listener. 
[01:03:30]  And starting on the 11th, they'll be live again.  That's it!  And you can do that all in a 30 second promo.  No problem.  Right.  You're not going to do it in an email.  You might as well do it in a 30 second promo.  Dummies.  Yeah.  Bunch of dummies.  Yeah, that's all weird shit.  Alright, as we go to break, Anthony, we'll play some Mitch Hedberg.  We've been talking about him and we'll get into some other things.  Lots happening in the world, huh?  We got some Robert Blake songs.  Well, that's a story about one of the jurors that is trying to get his rock career started 
[01:04:00]  and he's using the limelight that he's getting as being a Robert Blake juror to try to get his songs out there.  Okay.  I'm sure this is great stuff.  It's almost like that black chick who was on the OJ trial, the black girl who sounded really white.  Yeah.  And she was on the civil jury and she did the one person show about everyone in the black community must have wanted to cut her throat and I wanted to jump in with them.  She was the biggest racial sellout I've ever seen in my life. 
[01:04:30]  Awful.  You remember her?  Yeah.  It was on HBO or something, right?  Yeah.  She actually spun it into a little 15 minutes.  We have to care about Nicole.  Yuck.  So what promo is this one now?  What is this one, Eric?  Which one is this?  This is the one that starts running the Friday after we leave.  So this starts running like Friday after the show saying we're on vacation, coming back.  All that stuff you asked me to do with the saying we're coming back off the premium but all the worst of stuff has new intros and whatnot. 
[01:05:00]  That's that promo right there.  Uh oh.  Let's hear it.  Uh oh.  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony show is on vacation.  All right.  There you go.  There's the update.  Put down that straight razor.  Just get a hold of yourself.  And turn up the volume.  What is wrong with these people?  These worst of shows with brand new material.  Dude, I'm shaking.  I might pass out.  So if you thought you've heard it all before.  No, you're wrong.  You're stupid?  Your friends think you're stupid?  Think of it as a special edition DVD with direct your commentary.  What the fuck does that mean?  The Opie and Anthony show returns on April 11th. 
[01:05:30]  Off the premium and live from Boston.  All right.  Well, there's a third version.  Okay.  Third version.  I love when you take us out of context.  We sound like such idiots.  And I'm sure I was saying we sound like such idiots will be taken out of context.  There are times I stop myself now because I'm like, I don't feel like having to deal  with this in a promo.  It's going to be in a promo.  Derek did that one.  So it was him taking you out of context.  I love those.  I love those.  All right.  You're an idiot and I hate you.  There it is.  What?  He's in Europe.  Oh, really? 
[01:06:00]  Should we go to the phone now?  All right.  Mr. Halford.  Yes.  Rob Halford, everybody.  I thought you were coming in today.  No, I can't do that because I'm in my kitchen in England.  Oh, you're in England.  What time is it in England?  It's probably like one, two, three, four, five, six, I don't know, two maybe?  No?  It's late.  Hello?  Rob.  Yes.  What time is it over there?  Oh, God.  It's about one o'clock in the afternoon.  Oh, all right. 
[01:06:30]  One o'clock.  Yeah.  Yeah, we thought you were coming in, so this is a little weird.  Yeah, we thought you were coming in today.  We all had our cameras ready.  We were all happy.  Cameras and Judas Priest stuff.  Well, thank you, Tony.  We're out on the road at the moment.  We're doing a British tour right now.  So, are you guys doing Ozzfest again this year?  No, we had a blast with it last year.  You know, we were out with Sabbath and everybody.  It was a great Ozzfest last summer, and we were thrilled to be a part of that.  But this year, we're working by ourselves. 
[01:07:00]  We're still out on this massive reunion, too, supporting our new Reliefs Angel of Retribution,  which is out now.  And we're coming over to the States again now.  We're going to be over there starting around the latter part of May when we get back from Japan.  I almost went to Ozzfest in Philly, where you had to cover for Ozzy, and you played with Sabbath.  I mean, how long before that happened did you actually know that you were going to have to go out there and do all those Sabbath songs? 
[01:07:30]  About two hours before I went on stage.  Wow.  You pulled it off.  I called from Sharon.  She said that Ozzy was sick, and when I step in, there's nothing like plenty of notice, is there?  But I was happy to do it.  You know, I'm a massive Sabbath fan, so I just went out and did the precept for an hour and changed some clothes and went back out there and did the Sabbath stuff.  Did you know all the songs, or did you have to have some kind of a quick brush-up?  Yeah, I got a pretty good idea of what I had to do, but thank God Ozzy's AutoCue helped me out because I'm useless at remembering information this time. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, he's got like a teleprompter.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  An overload of technology.  Yeah, it makes it a little easier for you guys out there, huh?  Yeah.  So this new CD you're coming out with, is it like all old stuff, live, or is it all brand new material?  It's all brand new material.  This is the first new material we've put together since we're reunited last year.  So everything on our Angel of Retribution is brand spanking new.  Are you guys being well received on the road? 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, it's brilliant.  We're having a great time.  We're working all through Europe.  We just played our hometown in Birmingham, where I'm calling you from.  We played our hometown on Saturday.  That was off the hook.  It was just great to be back home.  And we're playing in Manchester tonight.  So we're just taking care of our home turf right now.  And are you finding out in general the fans just don't care about, you know, your personal life and everything that came out in the last few years?  No, I mean, you know, I think that's a kind of, we've exploded the myth about that kind of reaction within the metal community. 
[01:09:00]  Everything's going great.  And, you know, we're just glad to be back together and back out in the road.  And, you know, Priest is still making metal 35 years later.  We're just having a great time with it.  So you didn't feel any backlash whatsoever, huh?  Oh, no, none at all.  I mean, you know, that incident, that drama, if you want to call it, happened so many years ago that it's all kind of water under the bridge. 
[01:09:30]  That's great, man.  Do you feel better now and more relaxed and not worried or you don't carry the way?  You know, it's as intense as it ever was.  I mean, everything that we do is not diminished.  There's still all that love and that passion for what we do in metal is still in great shape.  And we've been welcomed back, you know, in an incredible way.  We can't wait to return back to America.  America's been looking after us for so many years and that's like home from home for Priest, you know. 
[01:10:00]  What made you guys want to get back together?  Was it like a money issue or did you just get sick of the solo stuff and you just missed the old stuff?  No, well, the fact of the matter is, you know, Priest has always been around.  The fact that I went off and did my solo stuff, which was important to me, I think I kind of got a lot of things that I needed to do musically in my heart and in my soul, accomplish that.  And there was always this wish and hope, I guess, not only from myself but from everybody that loves and supports Priest worldwide that we would get this reunion happening. 
[01:10:30]  And it took place, you know, it was ten years in the making, but it's like family, you know, families have friction amongst them.  But, you know, at the end of the day, blood is thicker than water and we're just back now in full force and out on the road and having a great time.  So you think you guys are getting along a little bit better than Motley Crue is? 
[01:11:00]  What's happening with the Crue? I know they're working right now. What's going on?  Well, go ahead.  I said they're out doing gigs, but, you know, everyone's always saying how they're just kind of infighting and that the whole tour probably won't make it.  Oh, okay. Well, you know, I guess it's all different things, means different things for different people.  But, you know, I'm a Crue fan and I'm glad to see the day back out.  So it's going to be a great time in America this year for rock and roll and metal.  When are you guys hitting the stage to tour? 
[01:11:30]  We're going to start out there probably in Minneapolis, St. Paul, sometime in the end of May, and then we're going all over.  Everything's on the priest website at judaspriest.com.  Very cool. All right. Thank you, Rob.  All right, buddy. Thanks so much.  We appreciate you calling today.  We'll see you when we get over there.  Yeah, come in and see us when you come to the States.  Say what?  Come in and see us when you come to the States.  Yeah, we'll do it.  All right.  All right, Nick.  See you, man.  Rob Halford, everybody. 
[01:12:00]  That's the only thing you've got to say?  Yeah, that's all I have to say to him.  Take it easy, you shit dick.  Javalog G from New York City.  Opie, shut the fuck up.  Who the fuck cares when you get off premium?  You dumb, whiny millionaire fuck.  All right.  That's not what I meant.  Who's that from?  Javalog G.  Sorry we take our jobs very seriously and we have passion for what we do, you idiot.  Why do you give him the satisfaction?  You idiot. 
[01:12:30]  Pat from Munaki.  Professor Anthony, could you clue in Opie as to the direction of the rotation of the earth?  Did you say two in the morning?  Because I just heard you say it's got to be two o'clock over there.  I meant to say, I said two, meaning two in the afternoon.  I didn't hear him say two in the morning.  I didn't say morning.  There's like two instant feedbacks here saying.  I was counting forward six hours.  Yeah.  I think that was a pretty good interview considering.  I thought he was coming in.  I know.  I thought he was coming in.  All of a sudden he's on the phone.  That came out of nowhere.  I got nothing to say to him.  Why not? 
[01:13:00]  What am I going to say to him?  What am I going to say to him except for, all right, take it easy, shit dick.  What else am I going to say?  I like Rob Halford.  Yeah, I like him too, you know.  I did a pretty good impromptu interview, eh?  I like it.  Jimmy really bailed everybody out on that one.  Because I think we'd have had a lot of trouble.  And I think we would have really gone down a bad place.  The old dirt road, if I may.  Yeah, I couldn't insult a legend like that.  I just can't do it.  All right, well, the whole thing stepping in for Ozzy, that was good stuff.  Yeah, I was kind of, part of me was like kind of bummed I missed it. 
[01:13:30]  Another part of me knows I would have cut my wrists in a tub if I was planning to see  Sabbath and anybody stepped in.  I wouldn't care if it was Bush.  That's true.  Anybody that stepped in a place of Ozzy, it just would have stunk.  Unless I had seen every show on the tour and said, okay, this is nice for this one time.  Little change, one time.  But if I went down to Philly, and I always have to shit when I go to Ozfest  because my schedule's all flipped up.  Yeah.  So I'm holding in a dump from two in the afternoon until they sing Paranoid at the end of the set.  So if I would have had to hold in a dump and then watch Halford walk out,  as much as I like him, it would have been a horrible disappointment to not see Ozzy. 
[01:14:00]  Mm-hmm.  I understand.  And off the subject, because I've been forgetting to do this for three days,  I have to do this from Baltimore.  The radio show helped me out a lot, and they are huge Opie and Anthony fans,  and they have been helping promote the show.  Out to Lunch, those guys are really cool, and they promoted my shows,  and they were great, and they just are big O&A fans down there in Baltimore.  All right.  What's Out to Lunch?  They're actually a really cool...  Is that the one we listened in on?  No, no, no.  That was the morning show.  Oh, all right.  Oh.  I thought they might have had a name for their show. 
[01:14:30]  No, no, no.  These are the guys in the afternoon.  I don't know the station.  They're out of Towson.  If I'm saying the name wrong, just call me up and smack my face,  but they were very, very cool, and they're big O&A fans.  And the guy was just...  You know what we could do today?  Ooh.  What's that?  When you were in Baltimore, we were listening in on your interview.  Yes.  You know that by now.  And then we kind of spanned the whole country to see what other morning shows were doing.  It was a lot of fun.  We listened in.  Any of them really bad?  Oh.  Just about all of them?  Yeah.  Just about all of them, and it was just fun to goof on.  If we're going to do this today, though, the listeners really got to help us out.  They got to know, like, how far away they can have their cell phone from the speakers, 
[01:15:00]  and, you know, so it runs a little smoother.  Call us, and I don't know.  It's real hard because there's so many commercials on regular radio.  Yeah, but that's what made it fun, too.  Every time we go to them.  It was a great commercial for satellite radio proving that there's just a bunch of junk  out there on regular radio.  Cabbage.  And, by the way, Javalog G, you just don't understand this business.  We need people to listen to our show.  We need this show to grow.  So we need to let people know immediately that we're off the premium channel so these 
[01:15:30]  new fans, they don't know anything about us, so they can start getting into the show  and enjoying it and then spreading the virus, as we call it, to other people.  So, Javalog, we'll be here broadcasting for your entertainment, you asshole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because guess what?  If we don't promote ourselves and if we don't market ourselves and, A, we leave it up  to XM or somebody else, well, guess what happens?  Less people are listening to us, there's no real interest in the show, and that's why 
[01:16:00]  it should matter to you because guess what?  We go away because no one's interested in the program.  And I'd like to say on behalf of what Opus is saying, and look, I don't mean to be a  whiny, thousand-air fuck, but I do want to say that you can start to see it in other  cities that it's definitely spreading already, but being off the premium is going to help.  And the reason it is?  Because we're pushing hard, hard, hard.  Hello, exactly!  If we just sat here and showed no passion, just did our radio show and didn't come up  with something called Spread the Virus, didn't come up with a show that the people could really 
[01:16:30]  be involved with, didn't promote the website and what Steve does on a regular basis.  Steve didn't sleep this weekend just to get clips up from the Hard Rock Cafe live broadcast.  Hello, exactly!  This is all the stuff that is building the show and making it possible for us to continue,  you idiots, so you should care.  Hello, exactly!  The assault on the media, all that stuff.  All that stuff.  Asshole!  Asshole!  Pardon my French, but you're an asshole!  It's only helping us out in the end. 
[01:17:00]  Because the reality is most of the country has no idea who Opian Anthony are.  I don't know about that.  I think you guys are a little more well-known than you think.  They might have heard the show because they don't have the exam, but I think they know who you are.  Well, I personally, I'm not going to assume that.  I'm just going to keep pushing, pushing, pushing.  Like it or not, Javalog.  Yeah, Javalog G.  Ooh.  Javalog G?  Well, listen to your radio show and your marketing strategy.  Let's see if it's a little better than what we're doing.  Why don't you get a show?  Yeah.  These dummies. 
[01:17:30]  I know it's boring at times to promote the show and get you guys out there to help us,  you know, spread the virus.  We understand that, but it has to be done.  It has to be done.  There was a sticker stop in West Palm this week.  What's her name?  I know her.  I like her, too.  She's really cool.  The girl that did it, she's on the message board.  I'm such an ass.  I don't know.  Ah.  She's from Whackbag.  She came out and she helped promote the...  She was really sick one day, so she came like two out of the three nights.  What an asshole I am.  I'm really sorry, sweetheart.  And she's hot, too, and she refused to bang me. 
[01:18:00]  But she's a nice girl and she did a great job.  All right.  Let's listen to some Mitch Hedberg.  I think that's where we were at before...  Oh, we were.  Kev has a sticker stop.  Where's your sticker stop next week, Kev?  Quickly, Pyle!  Quickly!  My sticker stop will be at the Livingston Toys R Us midnight Friday, April 1st for the  Midnight Madness Star Wars toy release.  Oh, boy.  That's going to be a bevy of...  Yeah.  Winners and non-pedophiles.  Your audience.  That's going to be something.  I don't know. 
[01:18:30]  It'll be a very, very tiny piece of our audience going to that.  A bunch of people with stuffed up runny noses waving lightsabers at each other.  Or as Ben wrote on the prep sheet...  Lightsabers.  Lightsabers.  Savor.  Like there's mint ones and peppermint.  Perhaps Master Polo will join us.  I like the yellow ones.  By the way, her name is Herky Jerky Liz.  I'm sorry I forgot that.  Very good.  Great rack.  Let's get the show back on the road here.  We were talking about Mitch Hedberg a while ago and here's a little sample of his comedy 
[01:19:00]  as we go to break here.  I like to talk about the differences between frogs and bears.  When there's a frog around, I don't have to hang my fucking sandwiches from a branch.  A frog knows they are for me.  He'd rather have a fly.  Because a fly zigzags and my sandwiches do not.  Unless I go like this.  If I want some honey on some toast, I don't have to squeeze a plastic frog. 
[01:19:30]  Alcoholism is a disease, but it's the only disease that you can get yelled at for having.  Goddamn Otto, you're an alcoholic.  Goddamn Otto, you have lupus.  One of those two doesn't sound right.  If you have to release bad news to the public, it will help if you are not ugly. 
[01:20:00]  I have a loose neck shirt because my neck is fragile.  I can't wear a regular shirt.  It hurts.  Especially turtlenecks.  I wear a turtleneck.  It's like being strangled by a really weak guy. 
[01:20:30]  All fucking day.  If you wear a turtleneck in a backpack, it's like a weak midget trying to bring you down.  I have two sisters.  One of them is named Wendy.  If you asked Wendy if I was weird, she'd probably say yeah.  But that's fucked up because she's weird.  Because she has a husband and two children.  And they have a family photo on top of their VCR.  Well they're all looking slightly to the left.  As though something is going on over there.  I'm always looking for you, and I'm always looking for you, and you're going to look for  somebody.  And I'm always looking for you, going to throw it over your face.  And I'm always looking for you, going to take a look.  And I'm always looking for you, of course.  I'm always looking for you, going to take a look.  I'll never get you, again.  What's going to be so nice?  I'll never get you, man.  See you, man?  I'll never get you!  See you, man. 
[01:21:00]  I have two sisters, and one of them is named Wendy.  If you asked Wendy if I was weird, she'd probably say yeah.  But that's fucked up.  and two children  and they have a family photo  on top of their VCR  where they're all looking  slightly to the left  as though something's going on over there.  The camera is right in front of you  but I guess something happened to the left  that made everybody happy.  And my sister is cross-eyed  so she can't quite pull it off. 
[01:21:30]  One eye is right the fuck on.  You know they advertise a casino on a billboard  they always show a picture of a guy winning money?  But that's false advertising  because that's what happens at least.  Perhaps when they advertise a hamburger  they could show a guy choking.  This is what happened once. 
[01:22:00]  For seven cents a day  you can get Opie and Anthony  or feed this little kid  with the flies on his face.  But you want to laugh, don't you?  You don't want to be depressed  watching starving children.  So turn them off  and turn on Opie and Anthony.  And we'll send you a photo  of the child you're helping  in the outfit of your choice.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is out.  I repeat, the virus is out.  It's Opie and Anthony.  The virus is spreading. 
[01:22:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  What the hell is that?  You guys want to talk to  Wheelchair Fred real fast? 
[01:23:00]  Oh, he's on the phone.  Yeah.  Good old Wheelchair Fred.  He has a big announcement, Anthony.  Yes, Fred.  What's going on today?  I can't hear you talk up.  Talk up.  What's up, Fred?  Your head.  What's up?  Your head.  That's a good one.  Thank you.  I've thought of it all night long.  You've thought of it all night long.  So what's going on today?  Basically, holy shit. 
[01:23:30]  All right.  Holy shit.  Do you have an announcement?  Boy, I don't know.  What?  No.  I don't think so.  Except I can't get laid.  You can't get laid.  But no, I was reading some of the emails  over the weekend.  You're going to be at the Boston appearance?  Yeah, I'll be at Boston help.  So email me.  I need a ride for sure. 
[01:24:00]  I got to ride, but the guy's left in the air.  Oh, wait.  He needs a ride to the Boston appearance, Anthony.  Uh-oh.  And I heard you had a 17-year-old kid that was going to drive you.  Yeah, I forgot.  Yeah, but he has to email me back.  He has to email you back.  Can we get him in?  What?  Can we get him in? 
[01:24:30]  Oh, can we get him into the appearance?  I'm not sure.  I'll have to ask Ben.  Oh, Ben gave the thumbs down.  No.  All right.  Here's the deal.  We're going to be live at Bill's Bar in Boston on Lansdowne Street for opening day, Anthony.  April 11th.  That's the first day back from our vacation.  That's why we've got to start heavily promoting it this week, because we're not going to be able  to when we're not here.  Right.  So we're hoping you guys can help us with this.  Yeah.  All right.  And the show time for this particular show is going to be 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on the East  Coast, because we want to get people as they're going into Fenway, you know? 
[01:25:00]  Of course.  And wheelchair Fred wants to go, but he does not have a ride.  I think that's what we're talking about, right, Fred?  That did you got it.  All right.  Well, he's so smart.  Someone has to give him a ride.  I'm not giving him a ride, because I think we're flying in or something.  Come on, I hope you can pick him up like the old days.  Yeah, there you go.  You're driving, right?  Yeah, I hope.  Go pick him up and drive by his house.  And then he hits me up.  I love the wife's chair to look at.  Fred also wants to know if we can, you know, give him donations while he's at the appearance. 
[01:25:30]  Have people donate some money?  Hi.  Well, we could, yeah.  Why not?  We'll get, like, a change thing.  We'll get you a cup.  We'll get you, like, a big, yeah, bring a bucket.  Yeah.  And we'll make an announcement.  We'll get on the stage for people to throw, you know, change and stuff in there.  Why not?  Why not?  The wheelchair Fred charity.  Yeah, you'll make some cash.  Here's a guy that needs...  This goes back to our first discussion of the day.  Here's a guy that really needs the help in his life. 
[01:26:00]  Yep.  He's not, he's not in this coma.  Yeah.  He knows exactly what's going on.  He knows his life is absolutely miserable and could really use the assist from some of  these kooks out there that are trying to keep Terry Schiavo alive.  Of course.  Here's a guy that knows every day that his life stinks and there's nothing he can do about it.  Yep.  No one's going to hire the guy.  And he can only make so much money from the government.  Yep.  His family has blown him off.  He has a son that doesn't even want to spend time with him.  Oh, don't bring that up. 
[01:26:30]  It's a touchy subject with Fred, but he's lost contact with his son.  Why doesn't your son talk to you, Fred?  About a month ago.  I'm in birth now.  Wow.  What?  He took you on birthday.  Did you talk to him?  I called, but he wasn't home.  Oh, he wasn't home.  Yeah, yeah.  But he's 20 now.  I have to give him a break.  He's 20 now.  I just did. 
[01:27:00]  He's only worried about himself.  Well, he's only worried about himself, so he didn't call you back, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  I'm telling you, this brings my argument full circle.  Oh, wow.  There are people like this out there that need the help.  Right.  And that would appreciate that help and would know that you're actually helping them.  Yeah.  But let's waste all the time on the Terry Schiavo case.  Time and resources.  Time and resources.  I don't, so I'm delayed.  Well, Freddie, you shut up. 
[01:27:30]  You're wrecking my whole argument by yelling out things like that.  Coming across as just a horny gimp.  I know.  He just wrecked my argument.  The horny gimp.  It's a horny gimp.  Maybe we could hook Fred up with Terry and he could just put his mule where the feeding tube used to go.  Oh.  All right, Fred.  We're going to let you be.  Yeah.  Oh, geez.  I don't even say that anymore because of you, Jimmy.  Thanks.  You wrecked that one.  Oh, dude, that's the worst thing, though.  Go put this in.  Hey, God. 
[01:28:00]  Email me.  All right.  What's your email address?  Because someone out there has got to pick you up for this appearance when we're in Boston.  Wheelerderf.  Wheelerderf at AOL.com.  AOL.com.  AOL.com.  All right.  Honestly, if someone out there could help Fred, you're going to the gig anyway, and you're kind of in the, what, Framingham area, Natick border, something like that, no?  Fred, help me.  Yeah, where are you, Fred?  I don't know if you moved.  Fred, you?  What?  Huh?  Fred? 
[01:28:30]  Fred?  I'm up here.  Where are you now?  What town do you live in?  I'm in the same old boy.  Same place?  In Framingham.  Framingham.  He's in that same place in Framingham.  Oh, okay.  Hey, Opie knows where it is.  Opie knows where it is.  You can go pick him up.  Yeah, of course.  I don't know where you live anymore, Fred.  That was years ago.  The one you stupid guy was years ago.  Dude, then I would drop him off, and then he would hit me up with money on his front stoop.  I live in the same apartment.  All right.  You live in the same apartment. 
[01:29:00]  All right.  I guess we just look for the deli where you pick up guys to have bang you.  Yeah.  And then it's only just a mere few hundred yards from there, right?  If you pick him up, you can go see the dildo in the toolbox.  Oh, baby, that's a bad memory now.  Take pictures.  I'm going to stick to dildos for a while.  All right.  He's going to stick to dildos for a while.  All right, Fred.  We'll see you in Boston when we broadcast live April 11th from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. East Coast  time at Bill's Bar in Boston on Lansdowne Street.  Bill's Bar. 
[01:29:30]  All right.  Thanks, Fred.  I'll catch you later.  Ciao.  Catch you later.  Ciao.  All right.  Yes, Jim.  I have to announce this because I almost, before we go on vacation, my Boston dates  have changed from April 8th, 9th.  I'll be in L.A. shooting Louis C.K. Pilots.  April 29th, 30th is when I will be out there performing at the Comedy Connection.  That has changed.  So your tickets will obviously be honored because there's a lot of tickets sold.  So I apologize for the inconvenience.  And are we going to be able to get tickets for the game?  I want to go see the game.  I think so.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  It's starting to shape up to be a pretty big party. 
[01:30:00]  Cool.  I mean, a lot of people are already calling Bill's Bar about our appearance.  It's going to be nuts.  Oh, nice.  It's going to be nuts.  And I think we're going to stay up there an extra day and do something Tuesday morning.  Cool.  A little like, you know, post-game hangover type show.  All right.  Giving out coffee and bagels.  And I think, yeah, that might even turn into an all-ages show.  I'm not sure yet.  Okay.  Ben's working on the details.  Yeah, get some of the young boys up there.  So we'll be up there for two days, you know, seeing some old faces, some new faces.  And hopefully the mayor and his gang will leave us alone. 
[01:30:30]  Why would they bother you?  Huh?  Why would they bother you?  You're not doing anything wrong.  He holds a grudge.  A little bit of a grudge.  A little bit.  A little bit.  The mayor.  Boston mayor.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Remember we said he was dead?  Right.  Go ahead, Anthony.  What happened?  Did you guys get in trouble for that?  Yeah, a little bit.  Steve G. from Bethpage.  Anthony, you kiss the ass of all these mediocre comics who come in.  Yet the best thing you could say to a true talent like Rob Halford is,  okay, shit dick, and not even loud enough to hear him, for him to hear. 
[01:31:00]  Real clever.  Well, that was out of character for you, Anthony.  What?  I must admit.  I noticed that you were...  Believe me, it was loud enough if the phones worked, first of all, sir.  And it's actually funny that he couldn't really hear it,  because it's not funny if a legend like that calls in and you insult him for no reason.  That was the funny part, is that it's kind of like an inside thing for the people.  He knew he wouldn't.  To me, you know what I mean?  That's what's funny about it.  This guy's upset because I said, like, I had nothing to say to Rob Halford,  and obviously he's from Long Island, a big Halford fan.  He's probably got his mullet, his leather jacket with, you know, Judas Priest written on the back, 
[01:31:30]  and I really stepped on his religion here, so I could understand why he's pissed off.  Did he mention that little Jimmy Norton really thought quick on his feet?  Because no one knew who was calling him?  Yeah, how about that, Steve?  Yeah, fella.  The Q99 Radio, Q99 Radio, the letter Q99 Radio at AOL.com.  Is that his email address?  I don't know.  Don't destroy the kid just because he had an opinion, Anthony.  Fuck him!  You're not the one that is known for making sure the guest hears the awfulness. 
[01:32:00]  He has to add in, I kiss ass of all the mediocre comics that come in.  He's bashing the whole show right there.  He's saying we have mediocre comics come in?  Dude, have you seen the list of comics that have come in?  I listened to that goddamn Patrice playback replay with the commo and the glass dildos.  It was hysterical.  Mediocre comic.  Shut up!  I heard Billy Burr was very, very funny on Friday as well.  Billy Burr was great to have in here.  He's hysterical.  We really, really enjoyed our time with Bill Burr when he was here Friday. 
[01:32:30]  I'm sorry your shit dick hero didn't hear me.  I was surprised you had nothing to say, really.  Q99 Radio.  Send him pictures of nude men.  Obviously, he likes gay men.  Why would you want that sent to yellowtreats at AOL.com?  Jesus.  Or ben.sparks at XMRadio.com.  Jesus.  Guy's a jackass.  All right, let's go to Chad.  That's right, I said it.  Jackass.  Language, young man. 
[01:33:00]  This is still my house.  Hey, Chad, what's up?  Hello, fellas.  Hi, Chad.  I just wanted to say thank you to Meaty Tits for the plug, by the way.  No problem, man.  You guys really helped me out.  I appreciate it.  Wait, you're one of the guys from that show?  Yeah, and it's great.  Ever since you guys went to Satellite, I've got a bunch of new bits for our show.  Like, I tell this story about when I was finger blasting this chick, and it smelled so bad,  I had to roll the window down.  Oh, there you go.  Might as well get some mileage out of it.  That's one of my favorite stories of all time, by the way.  It's great.  I was divorced, and my lawyer, Dominic Barber, and I were accosted on the steps of the courthouse, 
[01:33:30]  and I lost half of my money.  Yeah, all that good stuff.  Plenty of good material.  I just want to say thank you, and if anybody wants a wow sticker, you can come out to the  Out to Lunch appearance at the Iguana Canteen in Baltimore this Saturday.  This guy hands out wow stickers at his own appearances.  You've got to kind of love that.  Wait, so you do afternoons down there, bro?  We do middays.  Oh, middays, okay.  We're on the same station as Mike Source, and I wore my O&A wow shirt in, and they caught  a picture of it on the webcam, and the program director was salty, and apparently Geronimo 
[01:34:00]  was salty.  Really?  Yeah, it's real interesting, but I think you guys are great, and you're the reason I got  XM, and you're half the reason I got on the radio, so I want to say thanks a lot.  Hey, Chad, if you really want to upset Don, and I know this is coming from me, not you,  wear a picture of a live dog on your shirt.  I'm sure that will really bother him, or get a picture of a funny woman that someone  married who's interesting to listen to.  That'll really drive him nuts.  And if you want to keep him away from you...  There you go.  Nice.  All right, that wasn't funny.  Punch it out.  Kind of going to be one of my jokes a little bit. 
[01:34:30]  I like the fact he's on the station.  He fired a bad breath joke.  Good, Chad.  He does commercial radio, and he promotes our show when he can.  Nice.  You've got to respect that.  That's kind of cool.  I want to play Diary of a Dead Dog, but I don't have it here today.  That was very funny.  You heard that?  Yeah, the Diary of a Dead Dog was great.  Were you here, or were you on the road?  I was here, unless you played it with your new best friend, Bill.  I mean, I heard it when I was around.  I've got to tell you, Bill was just terrific.  He was just terrific.  I don't know.  I heard some things.  That's terrific.  No, that's just you thinking.  I heard he was great.  He was perfect. 
[01:35:00]  He fit in perfectly.  You know, I introduce you to nothing but funny people.  I really am an ass who's just playing with fire.  Here you go.  Look at this guy.  Funny.  Yeah, Norton.  He could sit in my seat and be all funny.  Yeah, Norton is a go-getter.  Like, oh, well, guys, you know, I know I have to hit the road, but I found the funniest  guys to take my place.  I really got to start bringing in real awful comics that will bomb.  So I'll have to hear some shit.  Like, that guy stunk.  It's like, yeah, where's Norton when you need him?  You really have a dope. 
[01:35:30]  You really are, actually.  So this Diary of a Dead Dog, you want to set it up in, or no?  What, the Don Geronimo Dead Dog thing?  Yeah.  He was backing out of his driveway one day, Don Geronimo, from the Don and Mike show, and  he ran over little Rudy, his little dog.  And it caused a lot of sorrow.  So somebody put together a little...  It's like that thing we heard, the Diary of a Fetus or something? 
[01:36:00]  An unborn fetus.  An unborn fetus.  An unborn child.  An unborn child, sure.  Yeah, the spoken word thing is taken from the fetus's point of view.  And this is taken from Rudy's point of view.  Are we replaying that when we go to break?  I mean, when we go on vacation?  The Don Geronimo saga?  The Diary of an Unborn Child?  Oh, the Unborn Child?  Yes.  That one's being read.  The whole thing where everything unedited.  That was a fun one.  All right, good.  XM is playing with us.  Good, good, good, good.  Well, here's Diary of a Dead Dog.  August 2002. 
[01:36:30]  I'm a cute little puppy in a pet store on the Upper East Side of New York.  I'm a Karen Terrier, and boy, am I cute.  September 2002.  I can't wait for a family to take me home.  Look at this lady.  I hope it's not her.  She looks like a real twat.  Christmas 2002.  That fucking twat brought me home, and it sucks here.  I keep hearing two words.  Career and failure.  February 2003. 
[01:37:00]  It's Valentine's Day, and the fat fuck named Mike still hasn't brushed his teeth.  I think I'll shit on his pillow.  September 2003.  I hate it here.  I've been here for seven dog years.  Nothing works here.  The mouthwash doesn't work.  Thanksgiving 2003.  I'd rather lick my ass than kiss Mike.  Did I mention they named me Rudy after the mayor of New York?  These people are dumber than the ball I chase.  March 2004. 
[01:37:30]  That cunt had my ball sack cut off.  October 2004.  I despise these freaks.  I just ass-fucked Clank.  That'll teach them to eat my kibble.  February 2005.  I'm running away.  They'll never find me, and I'll be happy with a family that doesn't suck ass.  March 2005. 
[01:38:00]  You killed me.  You ran me over because you were late for work.  You'll burn in hell.  I trusted you, you fat fuck.  And there you have it.  So trusting, little puppy.  That could be...  Gone.  That's one of the funniest things I've ever read on a message board.  Was that...  Was that pick that was drawn with, I trusted you, you fat fuck?  Oh, I know.  Beautiful.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[01:38:30]  Was that cigars and scotch?  Nobody remembers.  I don't know who it was.  One of ten of those assholes from the message board that know how to really strike a nerve.  I love those guys.  Pests, as we like to call them.  Only ten?  Pests.  Anthony, what is this, the juror from the Robert Blake trial?  Every jury now, for some reason, any of the high-profile cases, they have their jurors,  they sit there and deliberate, and they come up with their verdict, and they become celebrities. 
[01:39:00]  There's always one standout.  It's like American Idol.  They whittle them down from the original 12, and then one is a standout.  For the Peterson trial, you have that red-headed mess.  Who'd she look like?  Steven Tyler.  Kind of like Steven Tyler with red hair.  With red hair.  She was like a standout.  Looking more and more like a rock star, though.  Yeah.  The O.J. trial, you had that woman that wound up having that one-woman show thing on HBO.  Black Lady with White Voice, whatever her name was. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, Black Lady with White Voice, we called her.  And now the Robert Blake trial has its star.  This guy went on Larry King.  What he wants to do is get his rock music across.  He's been in the business, well, had a band for years, for decades, and he hasn't been  able to get any radio airplay.  So he used the interviews that Larry King and the press were doing with him for the Blake  trial to plug his CD. 
[01:40:00]  To plug his CD.  Judgment Day is his CD.  And I guess the judge told him he can't make any money off of this, because a juror can't  make any money off of being a juror for a trial.  And all the songs are about the case, right?  It seems like that.  One is called Blake View or something.  Blake View, Celebrity, Judgment Day, Nurse Nancy.  So he's really exploiting this whole thing, and the judge told him you can't sell it. 
[01:40:30]  So he wound up having to just put it online and have people download it for free.  What a tool.  So we downloaded some of the songs, and I haven't heard them.  This is going to be a first for all of us.  We'll sit back and see if this guy is as talented as the Remembering Lacey.  Well, why don't we take a listen to Blake View.  All right.  You know what that sounds like? 
[01:41:00]  That's the cheapest sounding guitar I've ever heard.  That sounds awful.  That sounds like that band from the movie Sling Blade.  You know when he had his house?  Dwight Yochan had his...  You're getting the fuck out of my house! 
[01:41:30]  Retard!  Retard!  No, you don't play that goddamn...  Play it right!  Oh, when he invited his buddies over to play.  What a...  He is probably one of the best scumbag characters ever in a movie.  I know.  I just...  I have my criticisms of that, though.  I didn't think he deserved to die in that movie.  They didn't make him bad.  Really?  No, he was...  They didn't make him bad enough to die.  He was a scumbag.  He was a douche, and he hit the girl once, and then he came back and apologized.  Yeah, but you could tell that was just going to go on and on and on, and God knows what  kind of a lunatic he was going to turn that poor kid into. 
[01:42:00]  Probably right, but they should have showed him hitting the kid, or...  He was just a boob more than anything.  He might have been pandering a little more.  I kind of like the fact that this go-getter saw this guy being a little, uh, a little much  to the family, and put a blade through his head.  I aim to kill you with it.  Hazard blade.  I love that.  Name a good lawnmower with blade to the face.  You know, even if he didn't deserve to die, probably one of the biggest assholes in a movie,  though.  Just a loudmouth dope. 
[01:42:30]  When his friends come by, the guy in the wheelchair, and they're all playing, and it's just that  awful song that went over and over.  And he throws them out at the end again.  Yeah, again.  Get out of my house!  Get the fuck out of my house!  And they, uh, invite the shit dick to go with him to, uh, pick up some beer, and...  Oh, that's wonderful.  That is a great movie.  It's one of the best acting performances ever, I think, with Billy Bob in that.  And this song, by the way, is perfect for the Blake trial, because listening to it makes  you wish that you were Bonnie Lee Blakely and taking a bullet in your head. 
[01:43:00]  This is horrendous.  Well, we haven't even heard the vocals yet.  I know.  I'm waiting for those to kick in.  Let's get the vocals going.  I'm sure they're good.  What?  You can't hear a word this idiot is saying. 
[01:43:30]  Let's see if this asshole can get on the Phil Spector trial and maybe have somebody produce  his next album.  You stink.  That is an awful recording of a song.  Here's a guy that, uh, he finally gets his 15 minutes...  Finally.  Finally gets his 15 minutes of fame, and he's getting attention today.  He's getting airplay everywhere, and look at this shit.  He's getting attention.  It's, uh, you know, it's sweeping the internet.  What a loser.  Here's his opportunity. 
[01:44:00]  You know, maybe there's a record company out there, if it was a good recording, might  have heard something.  Might have heard something like, hey, you know?  Hello?  What is it?  Uh-uh.  What is it?  What is it?  What is it?  What is it?  What is it?  Hello?  My bullhorn's broken.  My bullhorn's broken.  Oh, sweetie.  What happened?  Hawk, fix that bullhorn for Ant right now.  Batteries!  Stat!  All I heard was Ergo.  Fix that bullhorn for Ant.  I was going to sing just like him.  Like this? 
[01:44:30]  It's not the spring of the day, we're focused on my trail.  A trail?  A trail?  A trail?  A trail?  A trail?  I have really time to hear that.  I'm talking where I'm part from the drive.  If you're confused, you feel better than me.  Talk it up tonight, I'll bring it on to you. 
[01:45:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  Three whole chords, the whole song.  That's nice.  Ugh!  What an idiot.  Is there another song?  Maybe it's just the mood of that song is like the whole mumbling thing you can't quite hear.  Why don't we try Judgment Day?  Judgment Day.  The title track of this mess.  Whoa!  I'm not tuning that thing. 
[01:45:30]  He's a guitar playing so bad you can hear him counting.  Yeah.  You can hear.  Fingers, come on.  Yeah, you can just feel that he's counting in his head, trying to get it all in there.  All right, here's the vocals of this mess.  This guy just blew it. 
[01:46:00]  He stinks so bad that the vocals are so far in the back and there's so much like chorus  on it.  You can't understand a word he's saying.  And not even in a good Nirvana way. 
[01:46:30]  Not even a smell like teen spirit kind of way.  I'm not even going to argue with you today.  I cannot understand this guy.  It's awful.  We don't need to hear any more, right?  His big shot.  This is your shot, you idiot.  This is it.  You got our attention.  We've spent five, six minutes on it and that'll be it for you forever.  If we heard the words, do you know we would have played the whole song, probably try to  rhyme some different things with the whole Robert Blake thing.  We would have had fun with it.  Maybe there's a record producer out there that is listening to this and going, wow, you 
[01:47:00]  know the guy has some raw talent there.  He's a natural, but no one's going to make any opinion or decision on you.  William Hung gets more air time than you, you idiot.  You idiot.  I want to hear Nurse Nancy.  Ooh.  Ooh, maybe this is the one.  Rob Halpern. 
[01:47:30]  Shit dig.  Well, she'll stay healthy while we cry.  She'll take your empathy for her part in the kidnapping of the child and the place.  What?  Yeah.  Something about a kidnapping.  She'll take your story to a magazine and she'll purely face the street.  Speaking of Nirvana.  Yeah, he was really trying to do a Kurt thing there, wasn't he? 
[01:48:00]  A little Kurt action there.  I got another suggestion for him.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And then the Vino vein.  Pull your fucking brains out.  Yeah.  There you go.  What's his name, Ope?  That's called a missed opportunity.  Yeah.  His name is...  Who cares?  I'd love to get him on the phone.  Why?  To ask him why he didn't mix that right and where they could get it.  And as soon as he goes to tell us where to get it, we hang up on him.  Click.  Well, he'll say you can get it off his website or download it or whatever, but that's what  you'll get. 
[01:48:30]  Great opportunity.  Crap.  He didn't sell any copies today.  Nope.  Who's going, wow?  You know, no, I don't see it their way.  Yeah.  You know who's actually moving more product?  Pat from Munaki.  I hear Pat from Munaki is getting demands for his CD.  Remember the live show we did, St. Paddy's Day?  We had about five CDs, Pat from Munaki Volume 1, and it was all of his appearances on the  show.  And he was handing them out. 
[01:49:00]  And they went, you know, he was giving them away for free.  And he said if anybody wants any, they could email him or go to the whackbag.com and kind  of ask for them.  And he's been inundated with just huge requests for these.  He's printing up, I believe, another hundred CDs.  But he's moving product better than this guy.  The CD's awful, though.  We kind of tracked through it a little bit, didn't we?  Awful.  I think FedEx, you know, got it on his website, OAVirus.com, for your downloading pleasure. 
[01:49:30]  Can I tell this, Robert Blake, you're going to sell as many copies as the Terry Schiavo  Christmas CD.  Look, listen to when she drools Silent Night.  Oh, man.  Yeah, the guy, let's go to Paul in Georgia.  Paul, go ahead.  Yeah, hello, Paul.  Paul?  I can't hardly hear you.  All right.  I just wanted to know where this guy got his percussion from, a Casio keyboard or something.  He bought a Kmart. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, nice.  The whole mix was really great.  It's the cheapest guitar sound I've ever heard in my life.  Yeah, I'll punch it out.  I can't hear you.  And he was the winner of the talent contest between the jurors, I guess.  What?  They had a...  What?  It just seems like every time.  There's always a little vying for who's going to be the head...  Muckety-muck.  Yeah, the head muckety-muck, the guy that gets the most press after these things.  Yeah.  And he was it.  He had the opportunity.  Speaking of the CD, Anthony, Pat from Monaki is on the line. 
[01:50:30]  Pat?  Hey, guys.  How's it going this morning?  Hey, guys.  What's going on, Pat?  Not much.  Moving my CD.  Oh, yeah?  How's it going?  Oh, wonderful.  Actually, I cut things off, and now it's up on ONA virus.  Oh, wow.  You're not sending them out anymore?  Yeah.  Limited edition.  Oh, a virus dot com.  Yeah.  Are you signing them, Pat?  The ones I'm sending out, they're all getting signed. 
[01:51:00]  Wow.  How many have you sent out?  Well, I took in all the orders, and I'm going to get them all production this week, and then  I'm going to send them out, and I'm going to sign them all.  How many people want the CD?  10, 12, what?  It's almost 100 now.  Almost 100 people want this disc.  You should have put them up on eBay or something.  You can make some money.  Yeah, well, I didn't want to screw around.  Technically, it's XM content.  Well, actually, it's XM content.  Ah, who cares?  I love it. 
[01:51:30]  Pat, have you seen what they're selling on eBay?  No.  Oh, like key chains and stuff, yeah.  No, no.  They're XM content.  They're selling the show on eBay.  Bootlegging the show.  They're bootlegging the show.  It's been up there forever.  Just punch Opie and Anthony into eBay and check out what they got for sale.  Hey, Pat, did you get that girl's phone number?  Uh, no.  I think she took the MiFi and ran.  You should have asked for a number.  Like 69? 
[01:52:00]  Horrible.  No, because that was like your only opportunity to make out with a chick,  and I figured maybe you'd say, hey, why don't we, you know, go out or something.  Could have at least asked.  She might have said yes.  Yeah, that's true.  You were grabbing her tit, her ass, and kissing her.  What better opportunity are you going to get to ask a girl if you want to go out again?  Yeah, I should have asked her name, too.  Do you know what her name was? 
[01:52:30]  Uh, no.  He doesn't even know her name.  That's awesome.  Good.  Well, have you mulled that whole scene over in your head  and thought about how nice it was kissing a girl and grabbing ass and tit?  Oh, yeah.  It was much better than a year ago.  Oh, that was him getting his toe cut off him.  Yeah.  Of course.  And no prospects in the future, huh?  For women?  Uh, nothing on the horizon.  Great.  Poor bastard.  All right.  He's kind of a celebrity. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  And you've got to make that work for you, Pat.  Yeah.  Yeah, I've got to work.  Yeah.  Well, okay.  Your 15 minutes is just about up, Pat.  Tick tock.  Yeah, I know.  Anthony made a little clock with my toes on it.  Yeah, I did.  What?  I made...  I photoshopped a little clock with a toe on it.  In 15 minutes, it was almost there.  A little toe clock.  All right, Pat.  You have nothing.  All righty.  You have nothing today.  All right.  Uh, I had something, but I...  I forgot it. 
[01:53:30]  There you go.  Pat.  All right.  Pat from Monaki, everyone.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  You know what I want to sell on eBay, by the way, when I move?  I've got to sell my TV and my couch.  I'm going to try it on eBay.  Wow.  Really?  How else do you sell stuff like that?  I've got a great TV, but I just don't want my new apartment.  It doesn't fit.  You've got to promote that it has your actual DNA on it.  The couch?  Have you had sex on the couch?  No.  No, no.  It's a black leather couch.  Oh.  It's actually...  It's a...  No.  I hardly ever use my living room for anything.  Sponges right off?  No, no.  I've actually done nothing dirty on my couch or my chaise lounge. 
[01:54:00]  Anthony.  Here it is.  eBay.  You throw our names in.  Opie and Anthony Best Of.  I guess volumes 52 to 66.  It's a 15-CD set.  Jesus.  It's...  Then there's another one.  Opie and Anthony Best Of.  Volumes 31 to 40.  That's 10 CDs.  Yeah.  I'm seeing volumes 22 through 30.  Volumes 67 through 80.  Opie and Anthony CDs.  87 CDs.  A best of material.  800 plus minutes. 
[01:54:30]  13 CDs.  Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio Cup.  A cup.  Some guy's trying to sell the cup for 26 bucks.  26 dollars?  An Opie and Anthony autographed t-shirt from St. Paddy's Day.  Going for 20.50 so far.  A Royal Flush CD from WAAF.  That's a rarity.  $4.50.  One of my brother's autographed Opie and Anthony Cringe Radio WOW shirts.  Nice.  God, just email him.  I'll sign whatever for you. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Let's see.  Wow, that's a lot of this.  An Opie and Anthony Sex for Sam.  Two and three.  We only did one and two, right?  You did three, bro.  We did three?  Remember three?  Oh, yeah.  I don't want to remember three.  Jesus.  I thought we only did...  All right.  Yeah, we did three.  All right, so they got Sex for Sam the second time we did it and the third time, which was  the bad one.  Yep.  And then our 9-11 broadcast.  Oh.  Which I've never listened to again, by the way.  That's one of the only things I've refused to listen to. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, I don't want to hear that.  I don't like looking at the pictures.  I don't like watching the videos.  It's depressing.  I know we did really good radio, but I just don't want to listen to that again, ever.  Nah.  What's this Toby thing, Eric?  Let me tell you about eBay.  This guy online, when you're talking about eBay, he wants to raise $50,000 or he's going  to kill and eat his pet rabbit that he's had for a few years.  Oh, right.  Is this legit, though?  People are really setting up money?  It's set up through PayPal and everything.  It can't be.  Come on.  This is illegal.  You don't think this is real?  It's illegal. 
[01:56:00]  Well, people do stuff like this before...  Eric might have been had.  No, they take it down before...  It says, Toby is the cutest little bunny on the planet.  Unfortunately, he will die on June 30th, 2005, if you don't help.  I rescued him several months ago.  I found him under my porch.  That's the best part of this whole bit.  I found him under my porch, soaking wet, injured from what appeared to be an attack from an alley cat.  No, no, that was no alley cat. 
[01:56:30]  That was old Jimmy Norton.  The monster rain was coming.  I took him in, thinking he had no chance to live from his injuries, but miraculously, he recovered.  I have since spent several months nursing him to health.  Toby is a fighter, that's for sure.  Unfortunately, on June 30th, 2005, Toby will die.  I'm going to eat him.  I am going to take Toby to a butcher to have him slaughter this cute bunny.  I will then prepare Toby for a midsummer feast.  I have several recipes under consideration, which can be seen with some pretty graphic images under the recipe section, Anthony, of his website. 
[01:57:00]  I don't want to eat Toby.  He is my friend, and he has always been the most loving, adorable pet.  However, God is my witness.  I will devour this little guy unless I receive $50,000 into my account from donations or purchase of merchandise.  You can help this poor, helpless bunny's cause by making donations through my verified PayPal account,  by clicking on any of the donate buttons on the site, or by purchasing merchandise at the... 
[01:57:30]  Should we just get it?  Fake.  Savetoby.com, online store.  Fake.  Here's the current status of donations for Toby as of March 20th, 2005.  Thanks to everyone who has contributed.  It's up to $19,762.  No way.  This guy, $50,000.  He actually would have had a shot with this if he would have just said $1,000.  Yeah.  Because you would have had enough people donate $10 or $20.  But what a dope.  $50,000?  They're going to shut you down, stupid.  He said he has $19,000, though?  No way. 
[01:58:00]  No way.  You don't think?  PayPal received so many letters from the PETA and the ASPCA that they stopped donations to his account after he reached $20,000.  There really has to be some kind of law about charging.  You know, he could eat the rabbit.  He could even show it on the web if he wants.  But the second you start putting out a ransom like that, it becomes illegal.  But it's a bunny.  It doesn't matter. 
[01:58:30]  You're extorting money from people to keep them from seeing or hearing about or, you know, acknowledging the horror.  Right.  So it's illegal.  I'm sure they'll get his name out there and he'll get enough death threats from animal rights.  Maniacs.  All right.  As he should.  Let's go to Mark real fast.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How's it going?  Good.  What's up, sweet pitch?  Hi, Mark.  Guys, we tried to make a donation on that site and it stops you.  You can buy the merchandise, but you can't make a donation. 
[01:59:00]  Why did you want to make a donation?  I thought it was a good idea.  No way.  There's not one of our listeners out there that think this is a good idea.  No.  Listen, we just wanted to see if it was legit.  Right.  But it won't let you make a direct donation.  You have to buy merchandise.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  Punch it out.  Save Toby.  Let's see.  Snopes.com, my favorite site, which is, it dispels all urban myth.  Claim.  Fellow threatens to eat his pet rabbit unless $50,000 is donated through his website. 
[01:59:30]  Status.  False.  Origins.  At the beginning of February 2005, we began receiving emails from puzzled readers about  SaveToby.com, the site alleging to be run by a fellow intent upon killing and eating  his pet rabbit unless his demands for $50,000 were met.  Bunny lovers everywhere can once again breathe easily.  SaveToby.com is a hoax, although the site now lacks a disclaimer.  A visitor to it on February 9th spotted one that said,  Note, this is a joke.  Please only donate to buy gear or help support SaveToby.com. 
[02:00:00]  Even without such explicit clarification, certain things about the site should make the  buffoonery clear.  The premise of the threat gives away the jest.  Send money or I'll kill the rabbit.  Society regards rabbits as one of the most disposable pets.  Really?  I guess he gets into something there.  The balance figure, which purports to showcase the amount already extorted, is a fixed graphic,  not a counter. 
[02:00:30]  It's periodically edited to increase the number displayed.  Yeah, it's a little thin, too.  They're saying it's fake.  At the end of the save page, it says it's a joke.  Yeah, so it's fake.  Don't worry about it.  We should set up one of these sites.  Really?  Yeah, and then have some kind of thing where it promotes the radio show.  Get the whole country involved in this thing.  People are such sheep.  This reminds me of a certain case that's going on right now in the thing, you know, where 
[02:01:00]  save Terry.  Save Terry.  Let me keep my money or I'll pull the feeding tube.  That's right.  There you go.  Let Toby nibble at her innards.  Got another big celebrity calling in today, Anthony.  Oh.  Chris Jericho.  Hello.  Hello.  How are you, Mr. Jericho?  That's what we should do.  You should say, if you don't send $50,000 to Opie and Anthony, that you'll kill and eat  Chris Jericho. 
[02:01:30]  There'll be no eating of you, sir.  Yeah, that's like creepy on so many levels.  Chris.  We can make a couple bucks.  Do we have to call you Fozzy through this whole interview again?  No, it's Mule Juice McQueen.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's right.  That was like five years ago.  That was a long time ago.  All right.  I forgot.  That was a long time ago.  That's when we first started the band.  We were doing the alter ego thing.  Right.  Remember, it was myself and Dice Clay.  Yeah, Dice.  I remember that.  Dice didn't understand what was going on.  It was pretty funny to watch the reaction.  It was pretty cool.  Because back then, Anthony and I were really following wrestling. 
[02:02:00]  We're like, no, man, it's Chris Jericho.  We want to get into this a little bit.  And he wouldn't fess up to being Chris Jericho.  He wouldn't acknowledge it.  It was so annoying.  It was really annoying.  So, I mean, if that's what you were accomplishing that day, you did.  You accomplished it.  Well, that's my mission, to be annoying.  But you know what?  I've got to tell you something.  So, you did start this band, Fozzy, as a goof, sort of, right?  Well, we started out playing cover songs.  And we got a record deal from playing cover songs.  And so, I mean, the world has enough cover bands as it is.  So, we kind of came up with that whole story just to make it something a little bit different. 
[02:02:30]  So, that's kind of how the band started out originally, like, you know, six years ago when we first started.  And then what?  You started actually playing together and getting tight and writing your own songs?  Yeah, exactly.  We realized that we actually had some good chemistry as a band.  And we had chemistry as songwriters.  Like, three years ago, we started to, you know, just do our own thing and play our own stuff.  And, I mean, that's kind of where we've gone.  Like, the band kind of evolved into being an actual, you know, quote-unquote band. 
[02:03:00]  How often do you guys play?  You're touring out?  Or what are you doing with the band?  Yeah, we play as much as we can.  We play quite a few shows in the States, actually, after WWE shows.  But we've done a lot of stuff in Europe, actually.  We just did a tour of England in February.  We're going back there in May.  And we're doing a tour of Germany in April.  And we're doing some shows with Motorhead in the States coming up, actually, next week.  So, things are going good with the band as far as, you know, live shows go. 
[02:03:30]  They just released our third record called All That Remains, which is doing really good.  I mean, it's getting airplayed in, like, 70 stations across the States and the videos on MTV.  So, it's a good time for the band right now.  Really fast.  I mean, they're just starved for entertainment overseas, it seems like.  And I'm not, this is not, you know, I'm not trashing you, trust me, because I'm about to give you a great plug.  I think the new song is unbelievable.  But it just seems like everyone just goes over to Europe and just makes, you know, boatloads of dough.  And they just eat up whatever over there. 
[02:04:00]  And then it's a lot harder to make it in America.  Like, there's a lot of bands, and I'm not saying you again, but you just, something clicked in my head.  A lot of bands that have just been done for years in the States, and we end up talking to them over the years.  And all of a sudden, they're huge in Japan, huge in Germany, huge here.  But they can't even, you know, sell out a tiny little club in America.  It's the strangest thing.  And it happens over and over again.  That's not a cut down.  I mean, you're totally telling the truth.  It seems like, I think because maybe, like, in America, people are kind of more trend-oriented. 
[02:04:30]  You know, whatever's trendy is kind of what people are into.  But in Europe, there's not really trends.  It's just kind of everything exists over there.  You know, rock and roll and hard rock and metal is still very, very popular in Europe and in the U.K.  And all those countries there.  So maybe that has something to do with it.  I don't know, because you're right.  Like, a band like, you know, like Mr. Big, let's say.  Yeah.  You know, had a few hits in the States, and then that was basically it.  And when they played in Japan, they do, like, the Budokan, which is like Madison Square Garden, 
[02:05:00]  like five nights in a row, selling out all five nights.  Isn't that amazing?  And, you know, they come here and play, you know, at the frickin' Tribeca Rock Club in New York City.  There's a lot of examples of bands that are doing exactly what you just described, too.  Hey, are you going to be playing in L.A. with Motorhead in, like, early April?  Yeah, we're playing, actually, April 1st, we're playing with Motorhead in L.A.  You ever play with them before?  We never have.  I've hung out with Lemmy and done a bunch of stuff with them, promoted, but we've never  actually played together before.  Yeah, Lemmy's a rip. 
[02:05:30]  You know, he's the epitome of a rock star.  He's, like, almost 60, and he's banging all these, like, 20-year-old stripper girls,  and he has drinks every day and sleeps until 5 o'clock in the afternoon.  He's definitely the king of rock and roll, for sure.  Yeah.  Lemmy's a rip, man.  Well, Chris, so here's where it comes full circle.  So the whole Fozzy thing, and I, you know, we helped promote and stuff, and it wasn't  bad.  I'm not, you know, it was good for cover stuff, whatever.  And then my friend, Eddie, from Big Brother, the one-legged dude, he's a real good friend.  He's a real good friend of ours.  He emails me out of nowhere. 
[02:06:00]  He's like, dude, I just want to, you know, show you what I've been up to.  And it's the video for this song, Enemy, from your band, Fozzy.  And I'm like, all right, well, I'll check it out, because Eddie's a friend of mine, and,  you know, we sort of know Chris over the years.  And so I played the video, and I was blown away by the song and the video.  Yeah, cool, yeah.  It's actually pretty funny.  Did you see the whole version where Eddie throws himself over the edge of the building?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Why, they're not playing that version on?  On MTV, you know, the controversial ending. 
[02:06:30]  Are you kidding me?  Eddie, those pussies, man.  Let me just explain the video.  Eddie is, you know, one-legged Eddie, and he's showing up for work, I guess, because he's  in a suit and tie in his wheelchair.  And, you know, the elevator's busted, so now he has to go up, what, like 15 floors or whatever?  And he's crawling up, you know, the stairwell, Anthony, floor by floor by floor.  And while he's climbing, he's pretty much realizing how much his life sucks, because I guess he  lost a chick, and now she's banging someone else, right?  Right, Chris?  And then he decides, ah, screw this, and he goes all the way up to the roof, and then 
[02:07:00]  he gets himself to the side of the roof, he reads one last love letter or picture from  her or whatever, and then just throws himself off the roof.  He's like, I'm done.  Done.  But that's not the version they're running?  Well, no, like, yeah, the controversial ending, I mean, you can see, you know, I think it was  Jay-Z gets shot in his new video, like, you know, blood capsules and everything, but,  you know, we can't throw an amputee off of a rooftop.  Where's the justice in the world?  But yet, they've cut that ending out. 
[02:07:30]  But like you said, the video's getting a great response, and Eddie, may I just say, was an  awesome guy.  He worked his ass off in this video.  Because he really did have to, like, climb up the stairs just using his hands, and he  has only one leg.  Dude, he's an animal.  He's an animal, though.  But he moves around faster than you or I do with two legs.  Yeah.  Which is very natural for him, but, yeah, so when MTV accepted the video, they wouldn't  play, you know, the controversial ending, so they edit the ending out, which just kind  of doesn't make sense when the video happens.  He climbs to the top, and then that's it. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, that's the big payoff, and you don't really see him fall.  You just know that he threw himself over the side.  That's the payoff to the whole video.  That's the whole point, but it's typical MTV.  So just the fact that it got on MTV and it's in rotation is cool, but people have been going  to, like, there's a site called iFilm, which is an offshoot of iTunes.  Right.  And they show all the videos there, and, like, the video's, like, number two in the rock  section, because people want to check out the real version, you know?  Yeah.  But, yeah, the controversial ending that MTV does not want you to see is seen on iFilm.com. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, I didn't know Eddie was a buddy of yours.  He's a really good guy, man.  I was really impressed with him, and the thing that was cool is, like, our band, you know,  like, we don't have any money, and Eddie came out to do it basically just for, you  know, for fun and for his resume.  And we got him a ticket, and when he got to the airport to pick up his ticket, it wasn't  there for some reason.  Like, there was a screw-up at the airport.  So, like, most people would just show up at the airport and not have a ticket and just  say, you know, screw this and go home. 
[02:09:00]  But Eddie actually, like, called and stayed at the airport for, like, two or three hours  to make sure that he got the ticket to come to the shoot.  Like, just a total professional all across the board.  He was a great guy.  Yeah, I met him through the radio show, and he's just a good friend of mine to this day.  Really, really just a solid dude, so.  Yeah, very genuine, man.  He was a pleasure to work with and a pleasure to meet him.  So, he was the star of the Fozzie video for Enemy.  No, but, yeah, I mean, congratulations, because, I mean, I really, really like the song a lot.  A lot.  I appreciate that, man.  Thank you.  That's the song that's actually said it's getting airplay all across the states on, like, 
[02:09:30]  70 different stations.  But, I mean, you guys know how the radio business works.  To get played, like, on K-Rock in New York or, you know, KLS in L.A., you've got to  pay big bucks.  So, we're not getting played on those stations.  We're, like, the number one song, like, in Charlottesville, Virginia and Peoria, Illinois  and stuff like that.  Dude, hang.  You start out on the smaller stations and work your way up, kind of thing.  Hang with us.  This satellite radio thing is where it's all going, my brother.  Well, there you go.  And, see, I don't know if you guys know this as well, but I'm a satellite radio brother 
[02:10:00]  with you guys.  I'm really?  I, too, have my own show on the Boneyard, XM41, on Sunday nights at 8 p.m. Eastern,  called The Rock of Jericho.  I didn't know that.  I'll call in the show.  Yeah, well, yeah, that's the thing.  Actually, I taped the show on a dash in my hotel room and just send them the show and  then they edit in the songs later on.  But you guys are right.  I mean, it's so cool to be involved with XM Radio at this point because, and I think in  about three or four years, everybody's going to have an XM Radio in their car.  Right. 
[02:10:30]  I mean, don't you agree?  Oh, no.  XM Radio, as we know it now, is almost going to become obsolete.  Yeah, no.  We got in nice and early.  I mean, in another year or two, it's just going to blow everything away.  I mean, you can do whatever the hell you want.  You can swear.  You can, you know, do anything and you don't have to worry about sponsors and censors.  And, you know, I mean, it's definitely the way to go.  Hey, Chris, what's going on with wrestling in general?  We have WrestleMania coming up in just under two weeks.  You know, I'm going to be out in L.A.  That's April 3rd.  I'm trying to get back into it. 
[02:11:00]  There was a time when Ant and I were at WNEW.  We knew all the storylines sometimes better than some of the guys.  I mean, we were really obsessed with the whole thing.  And I don't know.  I mean, these guys are still doing well, but it just doesn't seem like you're doing as well as, you know, five, six years ago.  Well, let me ask you guys a question.  Being ex-avid wrestling fans, what was the reason that you got out of wrestling?  I liked when Vince just didn't give a shit, man.  And all these groups came forward and he was like, well, screw you.  I'm still going to be, you know, be politically incorrect and things like that. 
[02:11:30]  It just seems to me that he started listening to a lot of the advertisers  and a lot of these special interest groups just a little too much.  Because some of the stuff you guys got away with was just crazy.  It was crazy, yeah, at the time, you know.  I think a lot of it had to do with the whole Janet Jackson thing, you know, boob gate or whatever they called it last year at the Super Bowl.  Because after that, the SEC was tracking down huge.  And Vince, you know, he kind of played their game and didn't want to take the heat for it.  So we did really get toned down. 
[02:12:00]  And we were toning down anyways.  But after the Super Bowl last year, we kind of lost, we weren't even allowed to say, you know, like, hell or ass in the first hour of the show.  And that's how cookie cutter we got for a while.  Yeah, see, that's what I, and I noticed all those changes.  They kind of started subtly at first, but I don't know.  Man, the old days were, I don't know, you're beating the crap out of the old wrestler there.  And she's making out and she was pregnant and having.  Yeah, she was pregnant with a hand.  Yeah, she was having who's loved child and forgot the storyline at the time. 
[02:12:30]  Mark Henry, the big black man.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I love the ridiculous storyline.  They were great.  They just kept you really into, you know, what was going on.  Yeah, I guess, you know, after the whole, like I said, after boob date, you know, impregnating 80-year-old ladies and having them give birth to hands just wasn't apropos to the censors anymore.  It goes in phases, too.  It goes in waves, wrestling, the popularity, you know.  It goes up and down a little bit.  But, yeah, it always seems to come back. 
[02:13:00]  And I'm sure, you know, Vince will figure something out.  Yeah, it's not like you guys are hurting that bit.  I just noticed a drop-off as far as my viewing habits go.  That's all.  Well, that happened.  I mean, yeah, it definitely was very, very popular, kind of, you know, late 99, early 90s, early 2000.  Then we kind of suffered a little bit of a dip.  And that's kind of coming back up right now.  What it always does around WrestleMania time, like I said, you know, people come back, check it out.  Because there's always a buzz about WrestleMania.  It's like the Super Bowl of wrestling, you know.  And so hopefully we can continue on along that way. 
[02:13:30]  Because like you said, even though business is down, it's still a huge business.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Instead of playing in front of, you know, 8,000 people, we do in front of, you know, 5,000 or something along those lines.  Right.  So what do you do?  Like you said, it definitely comes in waves and in cycles.  It's always been that way since I started in 1990.  So we just have to, you know, ride the wave out until something catches on with the general public to bring up the awareness of all over again.  And what are you doing for WrestleMania this year?  I'm in a...  Money in the Bank ladder match.  Yeah.  For the number one contender for the WWE Championship. 
[02:14:00]  Okay.  So it's a pretty, you know, it's one of them crazy, badass ladder matches where you go out there and just get the shit kicked out of you by this stupid steel ladder.  So let's just see what happens.  Some of those ladder matches are just unbelievable.  All of them.  I had a ladder match last year in September.  I'm going to give you guys some inside information, probably too much information.  I slipped and fell off the damn ladder.  And I kind of landed on it ass first where, for all intents and purposes, the ladder went up my ass pretty much. 
[02:14:30]  And, you know, not exactly the best feeling.  And six months later, it still hurts me to sit.  So I had to go to the doctor last week.  And he said I'm having problems with my cossacks bone.  Have you ever heard of this?  It's like a tailbone, right?  The coccyx.  That's the end of your spine, right?  The end of the tailbone, it's this little frickin' bone at the very end, about half an inch long, called the cossacks.  And I've broken my cossacks, ladies and gentlemen.  So it's like I have to take all these pills and all this stuff for a broken cossacks. 
[02:15:00]  Only in wrestling, because you suffer from a broken cossacks at the end of your tailbone.  It's basically up your ass.  Nice work.  You broke your ass, basically.  Hey, Chris, have you seen the China X-Pac video?  You know what, man?  I have not watched it.  I can't bring myself to see it.  Even for, like, you know, a car crash mentality, I just don't know who had a bigger penis.  Was it China or was it X-Pac?  Yeah, exactly, man.  We were watching that one day in here, and wow, there's something going on down there. 
[02:15:30]  That's nice.  Is it bad?  Is it bad?  There's something going on down there?  It's as big as your thumb.  Oh, man.  It's like, you know, I've seen her on Surreal Life, and she's really fallen, man.  And it's just, I couldn't bring myself to look at that sex tape.  I mean, there's certain things.  I don't want to see two, you know, two wildebeests having sex either.  You know, it's not something that really appeals to me.  Well, the Surreal Life makes it look like China's a raging alcoholic, too.  Yeah, and a raging lunatic as well.  I know.  I know, and we've had her on the show many times, and it looks like to us that her personality 
[02:16:00]  has changed, and she's in a bad place these days.  I don't know.  Man, it's just the drugs, right?  I mean, you see it happen all the time.  I guess she just kind of lost herself.  It's actually a very sexy video.  She was a really, really nice girl, and she was on top of the world, you know, and people  just fall like that.  I don't know.  It happens in the wrestling game over and over again.  You know, I don't know why it's so susceptible in wrestling.  I guess they do rock and roll music as well, but people never learn their lessons.  People make some really bad moves, yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, is Hogan and Austin coming back for WrestleMania? 
[02:16:30]  Austin is coming back for WrestleMania for Piper's Pit, you know, with Roddy Piper.  Mm-hmm.  Roddy Piper.  And then Hogan is coming back to get inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.  Oh, but I bet you something will...  But he's not wrestling on WrestleMania.  Oh, yes, he will be, because something's going to happen.  Something's going to happen, I'm thinking.  It's going to be...  But yeah, something will happen where they end up coming back, especially Hogan.  And he always kind of comes back and forth, you know, every couple years.  Yeah.  And he hasn't been around for a while, so I bet you he's begging to come back. 
[02:17:00]  You know why he hasn't been out there on the road in the last few years?  No, he hasn't.  He worked with us back in, like, 2002.  No, I know.  It's been through three years.  I know.  I know the answer, though.  He wants to keep tabs on that hot daughter of his.  Exactly.  Dude, she's dressing...  She's, what, 15 or something, but she's dressing like she's, you know, in her 20s, and she's  showing up at all these, you know, premieres and stuff.  Just a piece of ass.  No, she is a hot chick, to say the least, for sure.  Yeah, she's only 15.  Something like that, but they're, you know, they're parading her out there like she's 
[02:17:30]  some sex symbol in her 20s or whatever.  You're getting that on the road, though, right, Chris?  When you tour with the band, get those 15-year-olds.  There's a picture.  It happens all the time, and what are you going to do, right?  As long as they don't tell the cops what difference does it make.  Wow.  Exactly.  They're trying to make her, like, into a Britney Spears, you know, Christina Aguilera, kind  of the, you know, 16-year-old flot.  You know, in her finger chick, you know?  In the face, she's much hotter than both those girls, too, by the way.  Oh, yeah, she's a big girl, too, man. 
[02:18:00]  She's about six feet tall.  Wow, really?  She'd whip their asses as well.  Yeah.  She's a great singer, too, so I'm assuming one of these days she'll probably break through.  I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing that Hogan's her dad, though.  I wonder if that would help or hinder, you know?  I don't know.  I'd hate to go over and pick her up and have to deal with the leg drop.  Hey, brother.  Oh, no.  What do you do to my daughter?  Like, some of the guys from the Backstreet Boys are calling his house, asking for her,  and he's like, listen, brother, she's 15.  Don't call back anymore. 
[02:18:30]  She's trouble.  Yeah, but she shouldn't dress like she dresses.  Oh, my God.  We're looking at another shot of her.  She's really not wearing much.  How are you supposed to know?  That is not a 15-year-old girl right there.  Right.  I mean, how is an unsuspecting guy like ourselves supposed to know?  I mean, we don't know.  Look at that.  Poor Hulk.  He's got to deal with that.  All right, Chris, you're coming to town in, I think, middle of April.  You should stop by.  Yeah, April 18th, we're coming to town.  Yeah, maybe I should come by. 
[02:19:00]  You guys are on until 10, right?  11.  Yeah, until 11.  We move the show to 11 a.m. East Coast.  Oh, that's awesome.  I'll try and set it up and come and hang out with you guys.  That'd be great.  XM Brothers.  Who would have ever funked it six years ago when I first came into your studio?  One day we'd be working for the same company.  All right, Chris, we'll let you be.  All right, fellas, we appreciate it.  All right, we'll talk to you soon, all right?  Okay, take care.  Bye.  There he goes, Chris Jericho.  We should play a song.  I should have told him we were going to play a song.  Someone will get back to him and tell him we played a song. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  Anthony, before we go to break, do you want to do the thing where we listen to other morning shows today?  The thing?  The thing?  We'll do a quick little thing.  We're going to do the thing.  You're here.  You're here.  I'm here.  Yeah, let's do the thing.  You want to do the thing?  Yeah.  Well, we're getting off premium April 2nd.  When men were oysters.  Jackass.  Where is Dice been?  I don't know.  I can't stand him, but boy, to hear him on the phone would be great.  Yeah, we'll get him back on.  He's got all sorts of rules or something, I guess. 
[02:20:00]  We'll see what kind of rules he has.  I don't care if he just says hello and we hang up.  I just got to hear him.  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah?  Shut up, jackass.  Dutch Clutch all day long.  All day long.  Dutch Clutch all day long.  What is that?  You bad.  You bad.  All right.  Bosco, you bad.  Well, we are trying to get the band back together.  Slowly but surely, we're getting the band back together. 
[02:20:30]  Speaking of which, starting April 2nd, we're going to be off the premium.  And after that, I think we're going to have to start expanding this channel a little bit.  Oh?  We're going to have to bring some shows into the mix.  Really?  Some here, some there.  Yeah, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit.  A little more variety for the channel.  Yeah.  And this worked great about a week and a half ago.  We had our listeners kind of tune in their local morning shows to kind of let them audition, basically.  Yeah, your wacky morning shows in a city near you.  See, because what happens in radio, if you're in a small market or something and you want to get to a bigger place in radio, 
[02:21:00]  you put together a demo tape or a demo CD.  Oh, and is it going to be just stuff that you pick out willy-nilly?  Oh, no.  Of course not.  It's the best of the best that you can do.  The cream of the crop.  Even the faithful listeners of this program know that, you know, there are days we just plain stink.  There you go.  You know, but our demo tape would never stink.  Of course not.  We have so many highlights.  So this is a better way to really get a feel for what these shows do.  So when you can just, you know, punch them in and on the spot see what they're up to. 
[02:21:30]  Pop in on them out of nowhere like Unexpected Company.  Right.  That's us.  Right.  So we're going to, we should do this for a little while today.  Yeah.  Again.  Maybe we'll find, you know, a future show for high voltage.  There you go.  So, but you've got to help us out.  The volume of the radio in your car has got to be just right.  The cell phone has to be just right, too.  Yeah.  Don't hold it right next to the speaker.  Turn the volume up to the right amount. 
[02:22:00]  You guys got to kind of think a little bit.  Yeah.  Think.  You know, try it out a little bit as we're in break to, you know, make sure it seems right to you.  Okay.  Yeah.  Like if your windows are down, you might want to roll up the windows, you know.  That's a good one.  Because this bit works nicely if you guys, you cooperate for us and help us out.  Okay.  Exactly.  All right.  Anthony, as we go to break, why don't we play Chris Jericho's Enemy song from his band Fozzy.  Sure.  The video really is great.  And it's just, well, it doesn't amaze me that MTV will get rid of that ending to that video. 
[02:22:30]  Because like he said, Jay-Z, 99 problems but the bitch ain't won.  Right.  That video is just a disaster at the end.  He's just getting blown away.  Yeah.  But they allowed that because why?  Because it's a hip-hop song?  Is MTV to blame or is it they're afraid people are going to sue if their kids jump off a building?  Yeah.  Oh, I can't stand that.  They can't play an episode of Jackass or...  Is that why Jackass isn't on anymore?  Yeah.  They finally gave up that fight?  Yeah.  I know...  It caused them a lot of problems. 
[02:23:00]  They put the umpteen thousand disclaimers in front of it and still these idiots are trying  to jump over moving cars and do other things.  I noticed they moved Wild Boys over to MTV, too, to try to hide that show a little bit.  Yeah.  God damn it, that's so funny.  They know it's popular, but they're like, let's just hide it over here.  Maybe it won't get as much attention.  I cannot get enough of that show.  It is so goddamn funny.  They just walk around like the two gayest individuals.  They're not gay, but how are they not...  You watch the show and they're like, oh, yeah, he's pretty much sticking his dick in that guy's ass, 
[02:23:30]  but it's not really gay.  Not when they do it.  They are so...  They are so straight, I think, and so secure with their sexuality that they can do the gayest thing  and know it's not gay for some reason.  It's hysterical in the show.  They'll do a close-up on Steve-O's face, and he'll start talking about what they're doing,  and they slowly pull back, and you see the other guy is behind him, like, almost ass-fucking him. 
[02:24:00]  It's hysterical.  It comes out of nowhere.  I find it very funny.  All right, but anyway, so the Wild Boys is now on MTV, too.  The box set just came out.  It's pretty good.  The extras are pretty good.  Yeah.  Some of the outtakes are all right.  Yeah.  So, all right, here's Fozzie and Amy as we go to break,  and when we come back, we'll check out some morning shows from around the country, okay?  Rock.  Rock.  Rock.  Rock.  Rock.  Rock.  Rock.  Rock.  Rock.  Rock. 
[02:24:30]  Rock.  Rock.  Rock.  Rock.  Rock.  Rock.  Rock.  Rock.  Rock.  Rock.  Rock.  Rock.  Rock. 
[02:25:00]  Rock.  Always there to remind me  That you're my enemy  All that we had has gone away  And there are times that fade away 
[02:25:30]  But you'll still be my enemy  The threat you had in me  You turned on so easily  I'm sad to see you go 
[02:26:00]  At least now I know  And I gotta keep moving  You're living on my stretch  Moving  The tower's on my back  And these are the things that I dream about  And you're always there to remind me  That you're my enemy  All that we had has gone away 
[02:26:30]  And there are times that fade away  But you'll still be my enemy  My enemy  My enemy  My enemy 
[02:27:00]  And I say, come in here now  You tried to need me  I say, come in here now  You tried to feed on me  I say, come in here now  I say, come in here now  You tried to feed on me 
[02:27:30]  I say, come in here now  You tried to bleed on me  And you're mine  And you're mine  And you're mine  And I'm me  All that we had  Has gone away  There are times that fade away  But you'll still be my enemy  My enemy 
[02:28:00]  My enemy  My enemy  My enemy  Let's do it! 
[02:28:30]  All right, we got lots going on today 
[02:29:00]  We might get into the Cindy Adams thing in a few minutes  I'm obsessed with Cindy Adams and her stupid column  Because it's so awful  Oh, she's funny  What a laugh  She's an ancient broad that's trying to still act hip  And I don't know  And just because she was married to a comedian  She thinks she's a comedian  And her jokes are just plain awful  Yep  And then I'm learning that Anthony's couch is going to be here sometime in May  It's like May or something  I'm telling everybody  Because I know Jimmy's got to get a new couch 
[02:29:30]  And it just takes forever to get a couch  Of course, you know, I lost my last couch  To the booger  To a booger  To a snotting incident  At a booger incident  That was, yeah  It had guests over the house with children  And I was sitting on the couch  And a little boy was sitting with his father  And the boy dug his finger in his nose  And pulled out a booger, I guess  And wiped it on the couch 
[02:30:00]  Wiped it like in between the cushions or something  And the father had asked him, you know  What did you do?  And he said, I picked my nose  He said, where is the booger?  He goes, in there  And he said he couldn't find it  The father goes, well, look for it  And he goes, I can't find it  And all I was  I'm sitting  Like, I'm just stiff as a board  Sitting there  And my head is just spinning  I'm going, oh my god  I have to throw this couch away  Yeah, you're so contradicting yourself today 
[02:30:30]  Why?  Why do you have a heart on?  It's stiff as a board  Because you started the show by saying that Howard was a glorophobe  A glorophobe?  I'm a glorophobe again  But that's like going out  No, I know, I know  I was going to continue with my statement  A germophobe  I understand what that is  Yeah, and a germophobe  Yeah, no, no  It has nothing to do with germs  I don't get  It's not a germ thing with me  Dude  It's not a germ thing  It's one lousy booger  It's a booger  It's a booger  If you really examined what else was going on with that couch  You'd be horrified  No, snot  Dry skin  Snot strikes a nerve with me 
[02:31:00]  That is only surpassed by shit  Only surpassed by shit  My level of disgust goes shit  Now, make sure you write this down, people  It's shit first on the list  Disgusting thing ever that could come out of a human being  Is shit  If it was near me  Or around me  God forbid  On me  I'd lose my mind  Okay  So that's number one 
[02:31:30]  The evil of all evils  To come out of a human body  Second on the list  Second  Is snot  I agree  If snot gets near or around me  Or God forbid on me  I will freak out  If it's on my couch  I throw the couch away  I agree  Third  Splooch  Probably  Puss  Puss  Some form of puss  Yes  Puss  So wait  There's like three things you could think of that are worse in your mouth than a load  I didn't say in my mouth 
[02:32:00]  Because  You want to take a load that needs a booger?  Here comes the promo  Because I've had  No, think of it this way  I'm even talking about myself  So I'm talking about snot or anything coming out of me  Disgust me  And if  You know  Who hasn't shot a load on their own gut?  Right?  It doesn't disgust you  And it goes down to urine  You know  Things like that  Down the line  Urine's one of the least  I know  It really is  You take a leak  You're leaking so much 
[02:32:30]  At this point  It's your best friend  Why not?  Right  What about earwax?  Earwax is  Pretty up there too  That's up there  Earwax  Probably right after pus  It's like a buttery goodness  It's tart  You ever put your tongue on your finger after you stick it in the earwax?  Don't make me  You almost made snot come out of my nose  You would never eat like a big watery runny booger?  It's like sucking down a loose piece of pasta  Stop it 
[02:33:00]  It's got a nice salty tinge to it  You just made me do the cricket snort  If I inadvertently like  You suck in  And you feel something more than just  You've never eaten your boogers?  Never!  Not one  Not one time  I can say  In all of my years  I have never, ever, ever eaten one of my boogers  Not once  I have never even contemplated it  Really?  I have actually been repulsed at the very thought 
[02:33:30]  So as not to even accidentally ingest a booger  I have never, ever, ever  You never yanked one of them off a little hair in the nose  One of those little fat ones?  Oh, those are wonderful  No, and if I'm picking at something  I can't even look at it  I have to get it away and off of me  And cleanse my hand immediately  It has to go  And when I used to work on the job  And see those construction workers  Plug off one nostril with the thumb and go 
[02:34:00]  Oh, the snot rocket  And the snot rocket  Those things rock  It would disturb me for hours  And I couldn't eat my lunch  Bill Madden taught me the snot rocket  When I was back in, like, junior high  We were playing basketball  I was like, and I need a tissue  He's like, screw that  Just do what I do  Right on the sideline  He didn't care  Right on the cheerleaders  If they were too close  If I blow my nose  I have to have a mirror right there, too  So I can make sure there's nothing hanging  And I have to, like, make, like, these things out of the toilet paper  The tissues 
[02:34:30]  That I can shove up my nose and twist around  And pull out, like, rubber bands  And make sure every bit of it's gone  You know what you do?  You wrap the toilet paper around the finger  And then you put the finger in  And you can dig and pick and scrape with your nail  Yeah, but sometimes it pushes it up  I found what's better  Is a loosely packed little twist of toilet paper  And then you can put it up there  Jiggle it around a little bit  And it kind of grabs on  And pulls it right out  Yeah  So, your thoughts, Anthony  On people that eat their own boogers  People that eat their own boogers 
[02:35:00]  These are not people  That you want living in your neighborhood  Do you want this as your neighbor?  Your friend?  The person sitting next to you at church?  Maybe on the job  On the go  Even looking out the window of your automobile  As you cruise this great land  Do you want to look over  And see some animal  Picking  Digging  Straining up to the knuckle  To pull out some of that green goodness  Take a look at it 
[02:35:30]  Slowly roll it between his finger and thumb  As he ponders the taste of it  I don't even know what he's thinking  When he's gazing into this  Glistening green orb  Between his fingers  But what does he do with it, people?  Does he get a tissue  And dispose of the ugliness?  Does he wipe it somewhere  Never to see it again?  No  He looks at it like it's some type of meal  And slowly puts it in his mouth 
[02:36:00]  And then  And then chomps on it  Between his little teeth  Before he, I don't know  Swallows it  Puts it between his cheek and gum  Like a skull  I don't know what goes on with the booger  After it goes in his mouth  But it's there  It's horrific  We need to do something  About these booger eaters  Thank you  Thank you  And I  Thank you very much  Thank you  Thank you, people  The booger is not 
[02:36:30]  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  No, great  Thank you  We as non-boogers  Thank you, people  Thank you, please  Thank you  I say  Put the booger down  Awful  Snot is the reason  I won't eat rice pudding  Says Clark Gifford  From Whackbag  I have no idea what that means  But something struck a nerve there  Rice pudding  Rice pudding is an awful invention 
[02:37:00]  Do you know there are dominatrices  That, well, I've read stories  Yeah  Stop it  Don't even say it  No, it's not  It's not what you think  It's not what you think  Snot rockets around the chest  No, where  She'll actually put her nose in your mouth  And blow her nose in your mouth  It's worse than I think  You're right  That is horrible  I'll tell you  The most disgusting thing for me  Is, to be honest with you  Period  There's nothing that gets me more than that  That, to me, is number one  Clark Clifford 
[02:37:30]  From Whackbag  Also saying  Snot is like the caviar of body fluids  When compared to shit  It really is  Very funny  With the food analogies there, Clark  Yeah, that can't  You don't enjoy the buttery goodness  Of the earwax  No  Earwax must also be cleaned out  With a rolled up piece of tissue  He's a Q-tip  Q-tips freak me out  They're too small  I don't know what they're doing  So what do you  How do you clean your ears? 
[02:38:00]  I take a piece of tissue paper  And roll it up  Roll it up  Stick it in there  And  Like that  And then  Pull it out  And that's just as good  Because I  I don't know  They're too hard at the tip sometimes  No  And they're small  You never know how far to stick them in  If you stick toilet paper in  It'll crunch back  If you go too far  There's no safety spring  On a  Yes sir  I now know the problem  With his headphones  It's his ears  He's got a wax build up  That's about four inches thick  What? 
[02:38:30]  No  You gotta scrape it out of there  With a little  I scrape it out really good  With the tissue  I love looking at that  Yellow on the Q-tip  Oh yeah  No, I wind it around  Like a corkscrew in there  When I forget to clean my ears  For a while  And I go in for  You know  Some goodness  And it comes out  Yeah  It'll  It'll ski me out  My extra crunchy  Oh my god  I'm like  I didn't know I was lying  On peanut butter  All night long  It's just  Should I make a peanut butter  And jelly sandwich  With this?  You know how you know  Your ears are filthy  Like when you scrape it  And it's not yellow  But it's a brownish yellow 
[02:39:00]  And it's actually up  Off the Q-tip  Almost  It's not just on the Q-tip  It's like you pulled  A physical piece  Of something out  Like your Q-tip  Is wearing a hat  Oh god  Ewax is not a hat  It's like a scab  Or something  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Exactly  You know this is something  That freaks me out  I've been a cop now  Thirteen years  Yeah  And I've worked  All over the city  There's not one  Police station  In this city  That I have not gone into  And walked into a urinal  That there's not  Boogers on the wall 
[02:39:30]  Oh, the people  Picking and wiping  I don't know  If it's one cop  That just goes around  The whole city  And picks his nose  And wipes the booger  On the wall  But there's not one  One urinal  In the whole city  You ever lean forward  And lick that wall  Yeah  Wow  Why not  And then they try  And like  Sometimes they try  And see how far  Up on the wall  They can get it  And the prisoners  Do that with shit too  Like monkeys  Throwing their crap around  Right  I've seen the cells  Where they'll  Like you know  I guess they'll  Do the finger in the ass 
[02:40:00]  Or something  And then they try  And see how far  They can get it  Up on the wall  Up on the wall  That's great  A little contest  For them  Jimmy did you try  That when you were  Downtown  I hate it  I tell you  That made me  A better citizen  Never get arrested again  Never get arrested  See  They taught you a lesson  One night  Was all it took  Brutal  Oh it was awful  God  That's disgusting  Yeah the booger  On the thing  The problem  With the booger  On the precinct wall  Is if you lick it  It won't come off  It's like a hard little bump  It's like a genital wart  On the wall  People  Kids would wipe  Like wipe snot 
[02:40:30]  Boogers  Under their desk  Yeah  And sometimes  If you were  Just kind of  Hanging out  And maybe you had  Your hand on one leg  And you go to  Like  I don't know  Tap your foot  For some reason  You touch the bottom  Of the desk  And feel just  Lumps under there  When a crusty one  Would fall off  I still get  Skeeved out  Just thinking about it  I have a confession  God's honest truth  I was a shock  Student Anthony  Back in the day  A shock student  And we'd be in  Some of these  Really boring  Like history classes  And stuff 
[02:41:00]  Yeah  And I was known  And it got to the point  Where people would  Collect money  Because they couldn't  Believe this was  Actually going on  I started it out  As a goof  And then  You know  How things spread  Around school  And I wonder why  I didn't start dating  Until I was like  A senior in high school  Then they would start  You know  Getting collections  Because they didn't  Believe it  So I would do it  And I would get  My lunch money  And what was this  I would  Reach under the desk  Feel for a good one  A good what  Wad of gum  That's been there 
[02:41:30]  For weeks  Maybe years  Who knows  Usually the hard ones  Oh my god  Scrape it out  You weren't that kid  I swear to god  I was  And I would  Yeah  Pop it in my mouth  For the  For the enjoyment  Of everybody  Screaming and yelling  As the teacher  Had his back  To the class  And then he would  Turn around  And wonder what  The hell was going on  Yeah  That was  That was me  That is really  Disgusting  I was that kid  Just for a little while  It was a little stage  I went through it  A little stage  Yeah  Were you ever 
[02:42:00]  Just sitting somewhere  And have a chunk  Of wax fall out  Of your ear  What  No  No  Never  Dan  No  Dan from Pennsylvania  I guess  Has had that happen  Thanks for having  This discussion  Right as I was  Eating my yogurt  Yeah yogurt  Not a good thing  To eat during this  Sometimes if I'm  Sitting there  And eating something  And maybe it's got  Oregano in it  And the oregano  Kind of looks snotty  I have to take it  Out of the plate  And hide it  Really  Anything booger  Like even 
[02:42:30]  So that way  Now bringing it back  That's why I had to  Get rid of the couch  Oh yeah  The booger  The booger was in there  Somewhere  Couldn't be found  So I couldn't  Sit  I couldn't recline  I couldn't lay  You know  Lay down  And not think of that booger  But if you couldn't find it  It tasks me  The booger tasks me  Maybe the kid never had  The booger on his finger  You ever think of that  What do you mean  Because you  You couldn't find it that day  He wiped it somewhere  And it's somewhere  Boogers don't just  Disappear Opie  It was somewhere 
[02:43:00]  In that couch  Couldn't you have it  Professionally cleaned  I mean  If you couldn't find the booger  Maybe it was in a cushion  Somewhere  So you'd never see it  Might have been able  To have it cleaned  It just had this  Booger stigma to it now  That I can't  I just couldn't  Get rid of it  Does the new couch  Now have the plastic on it  I haven't gotten  The new couch yet  I'm not getting it  Until next month  Because it takes forever  To get a couch  Are you still using this couch  No  What is it  We have no couch  I sit on a desk  Why don't you just keep  The old booger couch 
[02:43:30]  Until you've got the new couch  Oh no  Just throw a sheet  Or something over at the work  Booger couch  All the way as trash  Why didn't you put a sheet over  And just use it  Until that thing came  And what's a sheet going to do  What kind of  Booger protective qualities  Does a sheet have  Jimmy  That I don't know about  Are you kidding me  Yeah  What kind of  Booger shield  Does a sheet have  You didn't drop  Anthrax in your couch  It's just a yummy snack  It was the  And you should have  Put the couch up on ebay  Someone would have  Bought the Anthony Booger couch  I did not want 
[02:44:00]  That couch in the house  Anymore  It had to go  You know how many  Other places he touched  In your apartment  With boogers on his fingers  In your house  Exactly  And we were going around  For about two days  Spraying Windex  And Formula 405  And everything else  On the walls  And lights  Because they run around  Like they eat  And then they have  Their greasy little hands  And they touch everything  I saw  My beautiful  Big screen television  And I've seen  Big screen TVs  At people's houses 
[02:44:30]  That have kids  It is just a mess  Of smeared  Little kid hands  All over the place  And I looked at my TV  One day  And the sun was hitting  The screen right  And I just saw  This little hand print  Whack  Right on my screen  And I'm like  God damn it  You threw the TV away?  No  Because it wasn't booger  It was a TV  And TVs aren't known  For their absorbing qualities  Like a couch  And hopefully you don't lay on it  And I don't lay on it  I just watch it  So I had it  But I had it  With Windex 
[02:45:00]  And get that all cleaned off  And I was just like  God how do people  Have these little things  Running around their house  Little  Like Blair Witch  Little hand prints  On the walls  Turn around  Stand in the corner  I'm going to kill them  You're a lunatic  I'm not a lunatic  I'm a child hater  Something is going on  In that head of yours  Yeah  No I need things  My way  The end of your life  Is going to be spending  A desert inn in Vegas  And the entire top floor  Having ice cream made  Especially for you  What's wrong with a life like that? 
[02:45:30]  You have to  The maids would have to  Touch things with a certain  Amount of tissues  They couldn't open a can  Without five or six tissues  Someday  Have you been on the road  With this guy?  He's a take charge  Kind of guy  Anthony's already  Changing into him  On the road  What?  We see Anthony  Get his baggage  Usually at the airport  Of the city we're staying in  And then we  Kind of  If we're lucky  We get to see him  For the broadcast  For the broadcast  He's in his hotel room  With the shades down  Let me ask you  Would you do this  And this is not even 
[02:46:00]  As gross as it sounds  But like in a public toilet  When you lift the lid  Would you ever  Scrape your finger  Under some of the brown stuff  Under the toilet lid  Oh god  And just sniff your finger  Stop it  You know the crud  That builds up  On a public toilet though  Right?  Or any toilet  Yes I'm fully aware  Of this crud  You know that kid  Took one of those boogers  And put it right on your pillow  Stop it  Well he did  He was bouncing all over  Antony, Antony, Antony, Antony  Can't say your name  He's too small  Antony 
[02:46:30]  Little dirty  Probably touch his little pee  Like you know  His kids pee  And they touch their helmets  Probably touch your pillow  The pillow  The pillow  Alright now you're  Treading on a different area  Or he scratched  His little childish bum  Stop it  You know how they  Scratch their ass  Like a baby chimp  Yeah  They're just always  Touching and wiping  Hitch it  And touch Uncle Anthony's pillows  And how old is the kid?  I guess they're like  Seven  Eight  Seven  Well you know the kid  Is wiping his own ass 
[02:47:00]  And you know  A seven year old  Is not doing a good job  With that  So you gotta think  There's like  Microscopic  You know fecal matter  On his fingers  I disinfected the house  Did you?  Disinfected  And  If all else fails  I'll be moving soon anyway  Did they use your soap?  I'm looking  I know I just moved in  But I really am looking  To move  Why do you want to move?  Is there a booger in the garage  Somewhere?  What's the matter with you?  He wants to move  Because he realized  People were actually  In this house  So his new goal  Is to find a house  Where it's gonna be  Perfectly 
[02:47:30]  Safe  I need  Christine  I was looking  For new construction  And nobody  Will ever visit me  I won't let anyone  In this house  I can't wait for the day  That Anthony shows up  In a bubble costume  Rolling through the door  Yeah  I'm slowly but surely  Noticing you're changing  A little bit  A little bit  No guests  No guests  I might actually have  Like a cabana  By the pool  Where people can stay  That has to be bombed  Every so often  By an exterminator  Or something  Or they'll be doing the show  You'll be actually  In that room  Where the interns are 
[02:48:00]  And no one can come in there  And no one can come in there  Reading the news  I don't think I'm that crazy  You have to put those  Big gloves on  And reach through the wall  To read the newspaper  Like when you work  With nuclear stuff  That's how I think  We'll be reading the papers  Before the show  Yeah I have to reach  Into the studio here  And grab this  And go  With my big bulky  Outbreak gloves  Well Anthony  Let's see if this  Would bother you  Let's go to Tom  Alright it's Formula 409  Sorry I was off  A couple of numbers 
[02:48:30]  On my cleaning  What'd you say  408  405 I think  Oh  Yeah  Well the difference is  405 probably does nothing  For booger or fecal removal  That's right  409 is the stuff you needed  Let's say hi to Tom  He's on the Cape  Cape Cod that is  Tom  Hey  Ope and sugar tits  Hi Tom on the Cape  Hey  Alright I work in a prison  Down on Cape Cod  Bondsville House of Correction  And we have a child molester there  And he has Hep C  AIDS  And he has a colostomy back 
[02:49:00]  Oh Jesus  And he's an unruly inmate  So you know  Every now and again  When he gets a  When he gets a little fuss up  He starts throwing the stuff around  They have to bring the move team in  So they bring the move team in  This one time  And instead of cuffing up  And being escorted down a seg  Like a nice little lad  He decides to spray us all with it  And out of a fantastic time  The shield guy gets it all over everybody  It was good times all the way around  A colostomy bag being sprayed at you  He won the unlucky lottery 
[02:49:30]  That's hardcore  What happened to him  Well let's just say he fell down  Good  And he broke stuff  So you know  He broke stuff  Alright  Alright guys  Touching out  Thank you Tom  You can't blast a bunch of correction officers  With liquid shit  And not expect to get a savage beating for us  Some type of retribution  What do you think they're going to do  Laughing off  Oh look you got some on ya  Yeah all over my white shirt  You silly goose  Yeah oh you  Because you know a colostomy bag 
[02:50:00]  It's probably got pulp in it  It's not pure liquid  It's like stew  It hasn't gone through that mold  That mold that is your intestine  That kind of gives it that shape  There's a fingernail in it  Let's go to FanDick  FanDick  Hey what's up boys  How are you FanDick  I can hardly hear you  But you know that  Yeah I had Paul and Ron on  But it's 10 o'clock now man  You're heading into the midday  So the show just ended  Oh right  The morning shows are only on till 10  Yeah we kind of screwed up  The bid I think 
[02:50:30]  Damn  Well maybe we could do it from  DC  Yeah we're broadcasting from DC  Tomorrow and Wednesday  And we'll have full capabilities  For a regular radio show  So  People can hear us better on the phones  Oh yeah not a bad idea  Yeah  All right  Well I'll try back tomorrow  Or something then man  Punch me out  Thank you  My mister  Yeah we blew that  We wanted to check out  Some more morning shows today  Yeah  But I guess that is not going to happen  Is Ozzy coming here today  Or  What time  Between 10, 10.30 I'm guessing  This city might run a little late  We're prepared  All right  All right  All right why don't we take a quick break then 
[02:51:00]  And regroup  Is my sandwich here?  It's right next to you  Oh  Hey Hawk are we ever going to clear this area  For the legend to sit?  It will be cleared  It's a messy countertop  You can't have Ozzy come in and see a messy countertop  No  Jimmy's been working on his Ozzy stuff all morning I noticed  What have you written down there?  Just a couple of thought questions I may have  Thoughts  Not too many questions to be honest with you  Dude  You're going to be the one though  Now we'll all talk to him  Nope  I'm not talking to him  You're not talking to him?  No this is your moment  I want Jimmy to have his moment 
[02:51:30]  Well I'll chat with him  I mean I'm going to have a little chit chat  You're not going to be  You're not going to be leaning on us  It'll be a little awkward  But we're going to  Oh believe me  If I have to  I'll just yap at him  Until he walks out the door  Believe me  I can talk to Ozzy  I'm just going to  So that's what we're going to do  How many times can you say that you're God?  Nobody wants to hear that for an hour  No one wants to hear me talk to Ozzy  No one wants to hear Anthony talk to Ozzy  It's not true  You guys do great interviews  It doesn't matter  It's your obsession with Ozzy  That is going to come to light today  But everyone knows that  He's also still a rock legend  And you're still having a big guest on the show 
[02:52:00]  So just doing a regular interview is important  And don't we have spoken with him so many times on the phone  That he knows us  Isn't he our friend?  Yeah  So we can talk to him  Yeah of course  Right  And don't worry  We won't throw you under the bus or anything today  I don't care  We wouldn't do that  How can you?  No we really wouldn't do that  To you  We know how important this is to you  Yeah  Let's not do that  Ben  An Ozzy update or?  There's no update  He's going to be here sometime between 10 and 11  In worst case we can keep the channel on after 11

[02:59:00]  Yeah, that didn't really bother me  Unless it's real, you know, right there  I can picture myself in it  Then it's, you know  Could you watch a good scat video?  No, I've seen some of those  People send clips  And it is really hard to watch  I've seen some awful ones  The girl all bent over  And it just starts butting out like a volcano  Yeah  Her bong starts popping out  And then all of a sudden just creamy  Yeah, I don't like creamy  Yuck, yuck, yuck  Oh, God  Disgusting  I don't like creamy  Like there's something you do like  Remind me to tell you the story  About the time the suppository 
[02:59:30]  Bounced off my chest  I still cannot quite believe  That that goes on with you, Jim  I think I'll believe the urine thing  And the other kink that goes on in his life  With some of these hookers  But the shitting thing  I refuse to acknowledge his reality  I'm with your mom in this whole camp  Hi, Jim  This is Anthony  Yeah, hi, Jim  It's Anthony  Yes, um 
[03:00:00]  You know, Jimmy  Dr. Phil said  That women shitting on you is disgusting  Could we all make believe  It really doesn't happen?  Dr. Phil said you should kill yourself  You're a failure as a son at 36  Old log face  Oh, stop it  Peeing, crapping logs on him  His chest looks like the log flume  At Great Adventure  Whoosh  Disgusting 
[03:00:30]  I will not accept that as fact  And I like that  Whenever you do tell that story  You kind of smile  Like  Maybe it's not real  You're delusional  I'm not as bad as people would think  Say and he says things like that  That lead me to believe  I will say that women  Who have hooked up with me at times  Even just regular dates  Are always surprised  I'm not completely the creep  They expect me to be  Really?  Yes  The ones that live through it  Very gentlemanly  Yes  Very gentlemanly  Yeah, I'm nice  I'm not a scumbag  I'm a nice fella 
[03:01:00]  Until you get to know them a little  Yeah  And you start saying  Ooh, that smells good  And you start  Telling them  What it would be like  If they had to sit  And watch you  And her father  Oh yeah, that was a good one  Snuggling  And you jacking the father  Yeah  And just  And just as he lets it go  In my hand  He puts his face in my neck  And goes  And he just groans  In my neck  As it bubbles over  In my hand  And he paints these pictures  For these girls  Oh, is that horrific 
[03:01:30]  I used to love that one  And tell her how I was  Going to hug her grandmother  But then just grab her grandmother's ass  And press my heart on  Into it against the kitchen counter  Like into her crotch  Like  That's what she said too  She said the worst part  Of the whole  Like she'd come down the steps  And the way I would describe it  Is that me and her dad  Would have our pants  Pulled down just to mid-thigh  Like  We wouldn't be naked  And  And she said the worst part  Was the pants 
[03:02:00]  Not being all the way off  And the face in the neck  She said that was the worst part  Oh, the father  You feel his little razor stubble  On your neck  Like he can't look at me  But it just feels too good  To make me stop  And they'd have to walk around  With this image in their head  Oh, yeah  That is hysterical  You're an awful human  Too good  Would she laugh at that?  No  Maybe  She's like  Yeah 
[03:02:30]  It would just close her out  Why?  As soon as I found that out  I couldn't stop  Every time we saw a family member  I'd think of a  New way I could sexually accost them  That was great  It was so out there, man  We got a bunch of things  We can get into here  We got the contender drops  From, you know  The dude that committed suicide  His appearance finally  Was on TV the other night  It was a rocky weekend for me  A rocky Sunday 
[03:03:00]  Yeah  On one of those  American movie channels  Or something like that  Movie classics  Whatever the freak channel that is  Started with, you know, Rocky  And then they went all the way up to  I must break you  Rocky 4, I guess that was  One in Russia  Boy, that one dated well  That one aged well  The whole Cold War thing  Oh, I was thinking  If I could change  And you could change  We could all change  Just awful  Cold War propaganda garbage 
[03:03:30]  He's a trite ass  Stallone  Really?  Yeah  Yes  A trite ass  He's never had a real message  In any of his dumb movies  If I could change  And you could change  Then we could all change  They're chanting  Rocky, Rocky  At the end of the movie  They're all, you know  Hardline, communist  Russian  Soviet Union  They're all in there  To see Drago  Beat up Rocky  And of course  Rocky wins  And halfway through the fight 
[03:04:00]  They're chanting  Rocky, Rocky  And Gorbachev  The guy that had a career  Because he looked just like Gorbachev  Is  At the end  Rocky gives a little speech  And he stands up  And does the  The slow clap  Nothing worse in a movie  Than the slow clap  And he is the head of Russia  You know  Doing the slow clap  For Rocky  Gotta know when to do  The slow clap though  Oh yeah  Not another teen movie  That was  Oh I know  Very funny 
[03:04:30]  That's been brilliant  Rocky movies  I watched every one of them too  I just sat there  Watching these dopey movies  And it's all the same thing  Rocky  Feels he can't overcome a problem  Adrian doesn't quite believe in him  Adrian does believe in him  Rocky can overcome problems  First one was great  That's a great movie  The original Rocky  He was  He was  Profoundly retarded  In the first one  You watch it  It's like  Oh my god  This is a  It's a retarded man  And then by the last one  He's 
[03:05:00]  He's fine again  He's just Sylvester Stallone  He's not retarded Rocky  What happened  They punched his brains back in  It really doesn't quite work  Dude he's a cheese dick  I mean you look  He's a cornball  Yeah  I think First Blood was mediocre at best  The Rambo stunk  I know a lot of people love it  It's just not my type of film  And it can go in cash  I actually bought that  To take some corny  Unfunny dialogue out  And bring it in  Really  It's brutal  Horrible  When he tries to be funny  Yeah well I guess that's what happened  Yeah  Stop it  My mom will shoot 
[03:05:30]  You're actually going to bring that in for the show  I started  Well I brought in a tremendous special  About the guy  The girl  Who had sex with a teenage boy  That nobody ever played  Yeah  All right  Well and Sylvester Stallone now has his own magazine  And then I'm reading that he's  I think he's making his own pudding or something stupid  I'm making my own pudding  Pudding?  Something  What the hell is that?  Either pudding or something  Yeah I just put it  I put a pudding cup behind Buckus  Well they take like vanilla pudding  And throw a hair lip into it  That's fixed 
[03:06:00]  Didn't you sweetie?  Stinks  So uh  And by the way  They won't do Rocky 6  I think that he wants to make Rocky 6  Oh why?  What is that going to be?  Obviously he'll be a manager  Or something like that  Who's he playing Mickey?  The studio won't do it  You know  I think Tommy Morrison  Fights him again in this one  But if Ty Morrison cuts his knuckle  And Stallone just gives  Yeah enough with the Rocky movies  All right  Rambo was First Blood 
[03:06:30]  Moron  Yeah  Um  No I meant First Blood  Then the Rambo series  You didn't like the first Rambo movie?  Nah you know  A lot of body bags  I saw it just the other day too  And it was horrible  It doesn't hold up  He's a corn dick  Fucking cobra stunk  Marion Cabretti  Wait and  Everything he's done has been awful  Except the original Rocky  Let me get into this for a second  Cause I  I haven't seen Rambo in  Who knows  At least 10 years  ClichÃ©s  It's really bad  ClichÃ©s  ClichÃ©s  Really really bad  I remember it being  Not a bad movie at the time

[03:09:30]  Where you could combine  Like kind of witty dialogue  With action  And it works  And it doesn't suck  Two years later  You scared me  I thought you were going  A rare case  Where you could get a black cop  To get along with a white cop  No  Oh my god  I'm too old for this shit  I swear to god  I thought you were going  There like what  I'll say it's a rare case  Where you can do that  And it doesn't suck  You know what I like  When their car goes over something  And they both are  Through the windshield shot  Going  I love that in a movie  I know  And then you look  At what they were going over  It was Ben's lap  Let me  Let me  Let me see what we got here

[03:21:30]  Crew  And they're on  And they're  Right  In your house  Around your house  Or wherever you go  All day  And it's fun  For about the first  Week or two  But then the fucking  Second year comes  You know  It's like  Don't you guys  Have a fucking home  To go to  Yeah  It gets a little old  I'm sure  And so  And so the kids  Plus the kids  Went from being kids  To TV stars  And they were getting  All kind of flack  From the public  They were like  Being really ridiculed  And slutty  Not everybody  A lot of people  Were okay  I think most people  Were okay with it  But there were just  Some people 
[03:22:00]  That were really  Ragging the kids  Yeah  You always got to  Whack you out  There somewhere  You know  Jealous  The majority  Of the people  Were great  But the whole  Life switch  Really fucked with them  You know  And they started  You know  Doing drugs  And alcohol  Now you  You were also  You were  Back on  Well  When Shannon  Was diagnosed  With colon cancer  That just  I just  My little plan  Was like  I'll go first  You've got to admit  Guys  With the reputation  That I had 
[03:22:30]  I've got more  Chance of going  Before  She doesn't smoke  She doesn't drink  And she gets  With colon cancer  And I'm like  Smoking bungs  And running around  The fucking house  And vats of booze  Was there anything  That was ever shot  That you just didn't want  Shown on the show  That you said  You got to do  A lot  Did they honour it  Or did they show it anyway  No  I mean  When you see a show  It's like 25 minutes  Right  They're filming  From Monday  At 7 o'clock  Till every morning  Like 4 o'clock in the morning  And they got that  For a fucking week  A week you could 
[03:23:00]  Make a series  You know  Right  But the stuff  The trick to the show  I think  Was the editing  Yeah  And we just did  A wrap up thing  With Dr. Phil  Who incidentally  Is a really cool guy  Really  He really knows his stuff  Really  When I used to watch  You on the CBR  He said  Another fucking  Quack  But he really  Is a nice guy  Yeah  He kind of  Did he really  He just said  You're all fucking mad  And went home 
[03:23:30]  You're all mad  Did he help you out  A little bit  But the guy  Is just a really nice guy  Yeah  We had like a  Family thing  You know  Now you being  Going through  What you went through  With the drugs and stuff  You must have known  And seen your kids  Falling into the same rut  What  Did you try  Did you try to do anything  You know what  It's like  I quit smoking cigarettes  Just over four years ago  I just got a bit of  A moment of reality  If you like 
[03:24:00]  I just thought  How can I  Tell my kids  About not smoking  With a fucking  Mulberry in my mouth  Be an example  Be an example  And I never thought  I never thought  That I would ever  Quit smoking  I thought I would  Die with one in my hand  Yeah  And one day  I just went  People said to me  How did you do it  Ozzy  I just went  I took the patch up  And all that shit  And threw it  Threw the cigarettes  On the fire  And I made my mind  You know  People go  Oh I couldn't go  Anywhere without a cigarette  You can if you want to  It's one of those 
[03:24:30]  Daily things  Because I know  I used to smoke  It's one of those things  Where you know  You're picking the cigarette up  So you just don't do it  For that day  The best two cigarettes  Of the day  First thing in the morning  Last that night  Yeah  And the last night  When I was fucking hammered  Used to have a backlash  When the fucking bed  Was on fire  You know  Nothing better than  A nice cold beer  And a cigarette though  A flaming pair of balls  At four o'clock in the morning  Hey did you take  Did you take Sabbath  Off the ballot  At the awful 
[03:25:00]  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  Which should just be  Fireball  No no no  Let me explain  The situation  While I agree  For you  So  The Rock and Roll  Hall of Fame  Is run by  People that are  In the business  Not by the people  That don't go  At the back of  A music magazine  If you  Write and tell us  Who you think  You'd like  In the Rock and Roll  Hall of Fame  That's not fans  I disagree with that  Principle  Because they  I mean  You could get a job  Or anybody  Could get a job 
[03:25:30]  In a record  In one  And get both  You'd on the panel  And say  I think  Bruce Springsteen  Or Elton John  Or whatever  And for years  We were like  On the list  And I said  They ain't gonna  Fucking vote for us  They're musical snobs  And they never gave you guys  What they should have  Because you came from  A darker place  Than like Aerosmith  Or all these other bands  That are in there  And that shouldn't have  Been in there before you  But then  They had a really  Damning response to me  Which I didn't go out  For a fucking week  It frightened me that much  Into the respect  It was  So 
[03:26:00]  So lame  So  What does Ozzy want?  An award for  Biting the most heads  Of the most bass  Give me a fucking  Hands over  You scum  Like that's all  You ever did  In your career  That's it  I mean  You know  I mean  That's fucking  That proved my point  Actually  Wait you once  Bit of  No  I won't go there  Don't stop  I can still  Fucking use  My right arm  We got 
[03:26:30]  In a little way  And I can relate  Talking about  Your penis again  Yeah  Cause you know  We got in a lot of  Troll with our radio show  We had this couple  Have sex at St. Pat's Cathedral  So now wherever we go  That's all they want to know  So we can relate  On a small level  The whole bat question  The dove question  All that  That you've been asked  Thousands and thousands of times  So  Who wants to hear it anymore  Right?  Exactly  Fuck it  Well it was like  Yeah  It was like this  Oh please  What's the bats taste like?  I don't know  It's been that long ago  I don't know 
[03:27:00]  What fucking bread tastes like  I saw  You had a great answer  For that on Letterman  Years ago  You said  Bats taste kind of salty  Great response to that  What's your  I gotta ask  This is kind of  Dumb question  But like  What is your greatest fear  When you walk out on stage  Are you afraid  When you walk out?  Every night  People say  I've been doing it  For 30  30 odd years  And  People say  Oh you must have it down now  I never ever  Before I go on stage  I go through this  Inner torture  Am I gonna pull it off  If the crowd's gonna like me 
[03:27:30]  Am I gonna  Cause sometimes you go on stage  And you  And you  You go  It's going good tonight  And then you go on stage  And the people go  And go  You feeling okay  Oh no really  And you go  You think you're having a good time  See my perception is fucked  My perception  Is  All over the place  And then when I think  I'm doing a bad show  They go  Fuck it  And you get better with that  And it's  But I like  It's like  An invisible line  Once you cross  Cross that line  You're on  Whether you're good  Bad or 
[03:28:00]  Whatever  Right  I mean  Sometimes it's good  Sometimes it's fucking awful  But you still go through it  Before every time you go out  I don't  But this way  I don't need any laxatives  Yeah  I mean  The toilet is  Overflowing  Yeah  That's odd  Because you would think  You know  For so many years  Doing it  And stuff  When you come out  You just look like an animal  You look like the guy that  You know  Is confident  I always think  I always think  The worst  And Sharon goes  Just stand there  You know  I can't  Because I'm fucking me 
[03:28:30]  You know  Yeah  Sharon says  I don't know  You're 56  None of these fucking  Jumping around anymore  I just go  Keep me at home  Then if I can't do  What I gotta do  I'm gonna stand there  Like a fucking lemon  Yeah  And then people say  Oh why is Ozzy not moving  Then you get shit  Look how he did die  Just propping him up there  In my country  Up to that  Like  The fucking  The Ozzy  Hey how did you become  Friends with Elton John  I saw that on  One of the  Osborne shows there  It's a  A long story 
[03:29:00]  My wife used to hang around with him  Before she met me  It just seems like  A strange combination  I don't know  It's just a really  I don't know  It just happened  You know  He actually  He's a very nice guy  Hey that's a good guy though  For your wife to hang around  Before she met you with  You know nothing  Was happening  You know what  I don't  I never ask  But things like that  You know  I don't look at  It  That's  Look at any 
[03:29:30]  I mean  Any one of us  Could be homosexual  I wouldn't know it  Could be  Could be  Look around the room  I'm not  Yeah  I'm not a homosexual  No don't look at me  I was hoping you were going to look that way  I made the gender mistake  With a hooker once  I thought it was a chick  But it was a guy  But that's not gay  Because I didn't know  When I went into it  But you fucked her  Yeah  Well no  I kind of finished  And I was like  You got me  And you know  He left  Did you go poop shoot  Or what  No  I think he paid for a blowjob 
[03:30:00]  Yeah  It was a blowjob in Jersey  And I didn't know  I wouldn't give a fucking chance  Thank you  Look at that  I mean  I'll bet you  More than one person has done that  You know  Oh thank you  I think you're getting  He's the only one willing to admit it  In front of a lot of people  I mean  Some of these  These transsexuals  You don't know the fucking difference  Oh they're lovely  Looking a little nice right  These days  Science  Science and technology  Kickstart a fucking Harley  Every week  You know 
[03:30:30]  I've always wanted to ask you too  Is  No I'm not one of them  Oh no no no  You're not a tranny  The original Warpigs  You guys had like  It was an original version  You did to Warpigs  And then the lyrics  Which were really like  Dark lyrics  Did the record company  Make you change that  Or did you guys  Make a creative decision  To do it  It's  It's been that long ago  I can't remember  Fucking making the record  Did I make a record called Warpig?  No I mean  The only one  I do remember 
[03:31:00]  Volume 4  Was originally  Going to be called  Snowblown  And they said  No no  You can't  You can't  In those days  It was like  Cocaine  Right  You couldn't mention  Or have any connotations  So if you look  In the inside  Cover  I think it's  Volume 4  Yeah  Volume 4  And he's got  We'd like to thank  The great  Los Angeles  Coke  Cola company  Which is a little way  Of saying  Right 
[03:31:30]  You had to get it in there  Fucking blow on that album  Troublemakers  But you know  It's got a lot more liberals  People like to sing about it now  Yeah now it doesn't matter  Right  What do you listen to these days?  I don't  I'm currently  Doing some work  With a colleague of mine  On a Broadway musical  About Rasputin  Really?  It's really good  What I like about it  It's a different process 
[03:32:00]  Than writing songs  For an album  You can use a theme  Leapfrog it in and out of the song  So it's quite interesting  Yeah a couple of people  With roots in rock and roll  Getting into Broadway  It seems to be the thing to do  Well I've been working on this  For 10 years  Oh see  They're ripping you off  Boo  This box set you got  You cover some really interesting songs  You do In My Life 
[03:32:30]  And Sympathy for the Devil  Yeah  Fantastic  I had to have some  In my lives  In my lives  I heard  I was watching this movie one day  And Bette Midler was doing this thing  With this USO thing  For the military  And there was a part  Where she goes in to Vietnam  And I thought  That's one of the least  Beatles albums  Records  Of songs that's been covered  I mean I've always wanted to do  A version of White and Shade of Power  But everybody and their fucking  Grandmother's done that  So when I did the cover 
[03:33:00]  Actually  Up the road  There's a cover  There's an album called  Ozzy on the cover  With a lot more different  Different songs  As well as those  What was the only one you'd done before  That was like Evil Woman  I think  On the original Black Shadows  It was the only cover  I did for that  Moscow Peach Summit  Purple Haze  For Doug McGee  And the whole box  And the reason why  I did cover  Because I've been on about doing it 
[03:33:30]  For quite a while now  And the record company  We've got to put  The fucking Miss Piggy  Born to be Wild  And my wife says  Why don't you add  That covers  It was a lot of fun to make  Actually  It wasn't  Never established songs  And we didn't  We didn't change them  Around that  That much  Because sometimes  When you hear somebody  Go do a cover song  The only thing  Recognisable  Is the title  So we kept it  Nearly as true 
[03:34:00]  To their form  I'm really pleased  You know  One of the greatest things  About you  I've always loved  A lot of bands  Like Headliners  Especially will try to bring  Like a soft opener  And you always seem  To bring like  The fucking best bands  Out there  I've seen you  With Metallica  Motley Crue  When they were on fire  Is there anybody  You've ever been afraid  To follow  Or go on after  No  Way back in the day  When Kiss happened  I mean  That was like  A fucking revolution  I mean  We'd go on after Kiss 
[03:34:30]  They were up for us  And the fucking audiences  Were like  All their plays  And it's like  I don't want me to belong  Oh man  Really  But you know  I just plot on  I mean  There's been many a times  I was going  Fucking hell  How am I going to get  Through this  You know  But I just plot on  My own way  You know  You actually watch  The opening band  And just go  Fuck we're not going  To follow this  No  I try not to  Because  I either get influenced  Or I get pissed off  I like to live  I like to live in my own  A world before I go 
[03:35:00]  And stage  Because  It's  Sometimes I'll do it  But not very often  Hmm  Man  Look at  Jimmy's got a little picture  Of you on his shirt  Oh yeah  Jimmy's  You probably didn't get a dime  For that  Some bootleg  No I bought this  At Ozfest  I won't buy anything  Bootleg Ozzy  Oh really  Absolutely not  Nothing bootleg  Ozzy  To him  Ozzy  Just so you know  Jimmy's  I mean  You're Jimmy's hero  Simple as that  Number one  I don't suck  Cuff Jimmy  Number one fan 
[03:35:30]  Number one  There's no one bigger  In his mind than you  Yeah  It's really great  To be chatting with you  He spends half his time  On this radio show  Talking about you  Yep  You're my man  I think you've been  Ripped off by a lot of bands  I discussed that a lot  I think  I think  You too stole  Sunday Bloody Sunday  From Sabbath Bloody Sabbath  No we're still there  It's Sabbath Bloody  Oh shit  Oh look at that  I love your argument  Ozzy  Never a stranger  To controversy  Of course 
[03:36:00]  You know  The bat thing  And the Alamo  And stuff  Now I see you  Turn it up in the papers  The latest controversy  Cosmetic surgery  Well I had my dick shooting  All right  You heard it here  There you go  It's an exclusive  Screw page six  Screw whatever they're saying  And he had his dick shortened  They had a story about you  I don't know  It was getting fat injections  And  What the fuck do I want  To have a fat injection  If I get up and work out 
[03:36:30]  On a life cycle  For two fucking hours  Yeah it was like  That's a dumb idea  What I was reading  Is it was an injection of speed  So I could fucking pedal  Fast over my mind  They were taking fat  From your ass  And injecting it in your face  Or something  What?  Were you reading  The fucking paper  Upside down?  It says  That you admitted 
[03:37:00]  I have had a facelift  Yeah  My wife  Fucking smacked me  In the chin  I don't know  Ex-blooded  Black Sabbath singer  Came clean  After years of denying  He had gone under the knife  Ozzy  56  Had insisted  He lost his gaunt appearance  By ditching drink and drugs  And switching to clean living  But the rock wild man  Has now revealed  I've had a face job  And a new nose  It bolstered my confidence  To no end  Do I look any different? 
[03:37:30]  No  In the pictures  That they put  If that's the truth  I'm going to get  My fucking money back  So you never said this?  That you've had a face job  No job  It's real  I don't know  Where they get this shit from  I don't know  They're printing lies about you  Probably not the first time  Right?  Right  Sometimes I'm sure  You open up the paper  You read things  And go  I don't read it  Because I always get pissed  You get pissed  You do get pissed off  By that stuff still?  I won't read the magazine  But once it blew me 
[03:38:00]  And I go  Oh look at that  Every time I look at it  I look at the one in a million  It's something  I don't want to fucking read  Probably something about your family  Or something  Right?  I bet my face lived  What was the craziest thing  You read about yourself  That obviously wasn't true?  Just recently  I was in London  And there was  An article on Black South  And in bold writing  He said  Sabbath you should fire Ozzy  And I've never  I've never rejoined Sabbath 
[03:38:30]  We had a reunion  Because you'll never get  A studio album out of them  And the reason why I said  I wouldn't do it  I haven't  No the reason why I haven't done  Another studio album  With Bill Ward  Tony and I'm in case  Of what I'm saying  Because I said  If the music that we wrote  Wasn't as good  As when we left out  What's the fucking point?  Smart man  I mean  So many times  That so and so and so  And so has got back together  And I've gone  The album fucking sucks 
[03:39:00]  You do the same thing we do  That's great  Yeah  You might as well  Leave it on a high note  Just because  You know  The four of us  We're getting together  If the music  I'd be a fucking idiot  If I  I like this radio station  Say whatever you want  I can be  Oh man  Fuck fuck fuck fuck  No restrictions  Ozzy I know  It's great  It should be like  It should be like  It's in everybody  It should be  What's it gonna hurt?  What the hell's it gonna hurt?  My fucking  My hair's in the back of my neck 
[03:39:30]  And going  Do you want to say it right?  I don't know  Yeah you're gonna get  Somebody in trouble  They're gonna find me  It's in a fucking dry bar  Screw it man  Doesn't matter  Say what you want  So  We have had  Attempts at doing an album  But  I don't know  It just didn't feel right  You know  And this time  If we did do it  And it's still on the burner  You know  It's still on the back burner  Right  You know  If it's something coming out  As good as Paranautal  Massive Reality  Or Volume 4  That'd be a fucking idiot 
[03:40:00]  Not to do it  But  Why should I do  An album  And I'll go  Fuck  It's Black Sabbath  But it sucks  You know  It's easy for you to say  Also because you're doing  Very well these days  I mean  You're making a lot of money  And stuff  Are there any of the other guys  That are really  Hip on doing something like that  Just for financial reasons  Alone  No no no  They're doing all right  I mean  If  It takes four of us  And if there's one out of the four  That's not into it  For whatever reason  You're saying  It'll be Black Sabbath  Right  I've played Black Sabbath songs 
[03:40:30]  With great musicians  They've had  Various singers  And different band members  And  In my opinion  There's like  Two Black Sabbaths  The Ozzy one  And the Ronnie Jones deal  And it was a  I must confess  I did like  A couple of  Their albums  And Ronnie Jones deal  I mean  Did that piss you off  When you heard it  And went  Ah shit  This is good  Because it was like  A new Black Sabbath  And I didn't do so bad  At the end of the day  He did all right for himself  Of course 
[03:41:00]  People still want to hear you  Do the songs  I mean  Theo tried to do War Pigs  It was like  You know  An Iron Man  But  But you know  I remember  Getting a letter  Just after  About a year  After he joined  And he asked me  For royalties  For him singing my songs  And I went  Fuck you  That's a nice answer  Sure  You've got to be surprised  Too that after all these years  It's like a lot of guys  Are you winking at me  Or is that a switch  I actually blink a lot 
[03:41:30]  But I probably am  Subconsciously doing it  Because I'm just so happy  He's twitching a little bit  He's all nervous  That Ozzy's sitting right next to him  I'm just like  Petrified  I fucking forgot my question now  God damn it  Do I suck  Ozzy you threw him for a loop  Fuck  I love looking at you  Flustered like this  I'm just sitting here  Like an idiot  With my hands folded  I'm not saying shit  You don't understand  When people call up  And critique you  The slightest  He jumps all over him  Like they're talking about  His mother or something  Really just defends you 
[03:42:00]  Like a tiger  Well thank you  Well it's like  I know what it was  It was amazing  How like after all these years  Like you're still putting out  Stuff that's phenomenal  Like Just Want You  Is one of the fucking  Best songs you've ever done  And Perry Mason is phenomenal  That's like 30 years  After you started  It's just amazing  It hasn't taken it off  I'm so happy for Zach Wilde  He's just got  His album went to the charts  At 15  He must be fucking  Higher than a fucking kite right now  Yeah  That's great  We've had him on the show  I've got to tell you  For every 
[03:42:30]  For whatever  Bad things he's about  And crazy  He has worked his fucking butt up  Since he left me  He's a bad man  He just does not  He's unstoppable man  That guy's crazy though  But he can play  A fucking good guitar  Oh yeah  I should break in here  Because it's on a computer  Ozzy  So the show's going to end  In like 40 seconds  We want to make sure  We get all your plugs in  The new box set is  Prince of Darkness  It's released tomorrow right?  Yeah  And you're doing a signing  In New York City? 
[03:43:00]  Yeah  At Tower Records I think right?  On the Village  Oh in the Village?  Yeah  Ben knows fast?  Yes  4th Street in the Village  Tomorrow at 7 o'clock  Tomorrow at 7?  Yes  Okay  And also the Daily Show on Wednesday  And I think Conan tomorrow  And today Dr. Phil  And CNN Business News  Ozzy  Get some sleep  Jesus  They got you out like a  Look at you  You're working like an animal  Well  Someone's got to bring the coin  My wife likes shopping  So I got you something  To fucking  Hang here
