<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about their controversial on-air persona and the hypocrisy of being expected to be "nice."  A caller then reported hearing rumors of a merger affecting the show and Howard Stern’s program. The hosts segued into their "Whip Them Out Wednesday" segment, featuring listener calls describing their genitalia. Opie shared his disappointment at losing an auction for Hitler's globe, leading to humorous speculation about acquiring it illegally.  A caller then inquired about a planned poker tournament, transitioning into a comedic interview with producer Steve, whose unusual vocalizations were played and remixed.  Further caller segments covered the "Makeup Stuff Tuesday" prank, blogger reactions, and the resulting online search traffic, with suggestions to change the prank's day. The show touched upon the complicated relationship with other radio programs, notably friction with Howard Stern despite personal friendships between some staff members.

The show continued with more comedic segments: listener calls about humorous "wow" encounters; a caller complaining about Jimmy Dean sausage size; a discussion about a Florida woman auctioning a pancake depicting Jesus and Mary; and a news story about Sandra Day O'Connor’s husband finding a new relationship in an assisted living facility, which prompted humorous commentary on aging and memory loss.  A classic prank call, “They Call My Names Bill,” featuring a disoriented man, was then played.

Comedian Rich Voss joined as a studio guest. The show started with a discussion of a five-minute comedy bit with a cut punchline and a bizarre anecdote about a heater commercial featuring a convicted rapist and murderer.  Voss then took a fifth-grade pop quiz, showcasing significant difficulty with geography, symbols (misidentifying the ampersand), and history. He misspelled his daughter's name, explaining his choice of biblical names. A caller questioned the show's censorship practices. The quiz continued, revealing Voss’s lack of knowledge on surface area and the Cuban Missile Crisis.  His struggles led to humorous exchanges with the hosts.  A $1000 contest winner, Claudette, was interviewed, demonstrating unfamiliarity with the show. Voss's loud breathing prompted irritated comments from Opie, which Voss attributed to Nicorette gum.  More sound clips from Steve were played, prompting a discussion about possible sound plagiarism. Voss continued struggling with the quiz, misidentifying the president at the end of WWII and demonstrating limited understanding of the war. Callers offered commentary. Voss claimed a 141 IQ, a claim challenged by the hosts and callers.  A "dumb-off" between Voss, Bobby Kelly, and Francine was scheduled. Voss attempted to explain the Bay of Pigs, highlighting his limited historical knowledge. The segment concluded with discussion of Jim Jefferies' previous appearance and a stage-punching incident.  A caller noted Voss's IQ would qualify him for Mensa, leading to a proposal for an on-air IQ test with a $1000 reward.

Jim Jefferies joined Voss as a guest. Voss recounted a chaotic comedy club experience involving a heckler breaking a woman's nose. Jefferies described being hit by a heckler, with the video going viral. The conversation shifted to high-fives versus fist bumps, leading to a "Wake Up Your Roommate Wednesday" call using a train horn, followed by discussion of Jefferies' upcoming performances at Caroline's Comedy Club. A caller from Australia discussed cultural humor differences. The hosts discussed Voss's IQ and parenting skills, interspersed with the edited train horn call. A caller complained to Jimmy Dean about sausage size, with the irate call played.  This transitioned into a discussion about the caller’s obesity. Jefferies recounted a heckling incident in Kansas. The show then discussed a man calling 911 for beer, including commentary from local residents. Voss's perceived lack of intelligence remained a recurring theme. Jefferies discussed his gigs and anecdotes from performing for troops in Iraq and staying at Uday Hussein's palace, including an incident with plastic explosives. The show ended with a discussion of "Two Girls One Cup," venturing into sexually transmitted diseases, with Jefferies and Voss sharing anecdotes. The segment concluded with discussion of Jefferies' comedy and YouTube videos.

A segment focused on a caller nicknamed "Big A," weighing around 390 pounds, featured crude banter about his weight, loneliness, and lack of sex.  They suggested solutions, including a woman eating his anus.  The conversation shifted to weight measurement systems, leading to more jokes. A picture of three older men engaging in oral sex was shown. Jefferies shared a graphic anecdote about a lodged sex toy. He also shared stories from Australia and England, his views on racism, and his experience as a film extra.  A previous segment about a wheelchair-bound man masturbating was briefly mentioned. The discussion touched upon Jefferies' stand-up and an aborted TV pilot, "Danger Mouth." Big A was weighed, revealing his weight to be 407 pounds.

The final segment contained extremely sexually explicit and offensive language.  Topics included self-fellatio, a planned "wall" sex stunt involving Big A, Big A's sexual performance issues with prostitutes from the Bunny Ranch, Jefferies' experiences in the British porn industry, pornography preferences, and graphic descriptions of sexual acts.  The show concluded with the "Line of the Day," revealed after technical difficulties, as "What does IQ stand for? Intellectual Quotation.”

[00:05:00]  i i wanted to possess hitler's globe yes for sale it was uh up on auction it was up on auction they said  it should draw between uh fifteen thousand yeah and twenty thousand dollars that's a big chunk of  change but it's hitler's globe for the love of god how'd they know it was his was it was the israel  erased yeah there was no israel uh and uh yes all the whole globe was just handwritten in hitler mine 
[00:05:30]  i i'll speak for myself and i i think jimmy might have been with me on this one we i think we both  thought you were gonna admit that you drink too much or something oh don't be silly and now it's  just about hitler's globe it's hitler's globe all right no i i i want i i wanted to bid on it so i  got a uh i got the paperwork did you really on it oh yeah yeah because we dropped this storyline oh i  know all right go ahead but because you know i was waiting until it happened yeah and uh i figured i'd 
[00:06:00]  go i'd go to the top end of what they expected hitler's globe to go for which was what it was about  twenty thousand so you bid twenty thousand i would have paid twenty thousand dollars for adolf hitler's  globe okay why not why not it's hitler's globe i have a brand new office that uh looks very nice  and i think hitler's globe would have been a fine part of the collection and uh it uh it was sold at 
[00:06:30]  auction uh yesterday for one hundred and fifteen thousand dollars wow by some gentleman uh in his  seventies in san francisco some guy that has a retirement fund said screw it this is what i'm  doing with uh yeah yeah money i'm supposed to leave to my now he's gonna have hitler's globe and i don't  you can't feel bad about that though you you you bid a sixth of what you would have had to pay you 
[00:07:00]  got killed i know that's just it you know they it's never close to what they say it expects to get  and then sometimes some things are up for a bid and it goes oh it didn't even come close to getting  what they expected so they pulled it you know it's like what where are you where are you gonna pay a  hundred one hundred and fifteen thousand for it no then why are you bummed i'm with jimmy because i  wasn't even close uh because they said they expected it to go for between 15 and 20 all right 
[00:07:30]  knowing you i think you would have squeezed out maybe your top bid would have been 30 probably and  that's pushing it that's it even with that you got killed i wanted hitler's globe well you can't  have it damn it you'll get nothing and like it i'll get nothing and like it you won't get a hitler's  globe uh people are suggesting i pay someone to steal it no can't be stealing hitler's globe  how much would you be ethical but how much would you pay if someone uh brought us hitler's globe 
[00:08:00]  uh most i'd pay was uh stolen you mean yeah stolen a hot the hitler's globe i ain't paying more than  five g's what if we could do it you know on the down low on the dl no one knows no because then i  couldn't like talk about it the whole reason of getting it would be able to talk about it talk  about how i would go into my office and just look at the globe probably like hitler did kind of oh  look look i'm gonna invade this we're gonna buy you a globe it won't be hitler's yeah well because 
[00:08:30]  we're gonna tell you was that there was a second one there was no second globe right it's gonna be  under your christmas tree this year just forget we have this conversation but just remember it's  hitler's glow hitler's glove wink wink nudge nudge all righty be a regular globe with just like a  little nazi hat on it oh a little mustache taped to prussia with a made in china that bad hair on top

[00:10:00]  we could call it laid off last time um we're very interested in the poker tournament y'all guys were  going to hold and uh was wondering if y'all guys were going to get together another poker tournament um  they say at uh one of the atlantic uh casinos i've heard tell of uh i thought they would have had that  done by now i think uh some uh some top people in this company yeah uh have brought up that and  thought i think it's a very good idea uh the uh event that we were going to before we had a little 
[00:10:30]  issue um was was sold out it was sold out they were just hoping to get you know a few people in  there and play some cards but um uh it was it's it's sold out it was huge and uh yeah i think we're  going to be doing it doing that again not only was the tournament sells itself sold out but a lot of  you know fans were just going down there yeah going down there to play afterwards yeah when people got  knocked out of the tournament they wanted to go down there and play with them so uh yeah we'll get 
[00:11:00]  something like that together all right i was i was uh looking real forward to it and uh this uh next  year i'm going to the main event in vegas to play in the uh main event so uh uh i was looking forward  to it and was sad that uh y'all guys canceled it but you know under the circumstances i understand  well we didn't we had nothing to do with it yeah i would have liked to have uh played that but  yeah we'll get something else together all right mike thank you thanks guys  what what you are hearing are stupid steve noises these are some of the sounds steve makes 
[00:11:30]  when he goes into the production room to put together production for the opian anthony show  you got oh what and this is my favorite and then you got this one 
[00:12:00]  and then this one oh i didn't realize  what's wrong why does he do that don't do that it's too late because now everybody just walks around  imitating steve oh we just do that now what's the matter with him i don't know some people like  you know you warm up in there a little bit if you're doing a read you go like 
[00:12:30]  what is that steve steve why that obnoxious sound i don't know it's just it's one of the flurry of  horrible things that are going around in my brain when i wow how long you've been doing that sound  honestly that's beyond production no that's just weird i've been doing that for a while it just  happened to get picked up on a right yeah uh months months and months months yeah i would walk in and  just it you know it's just one of those things you know yeah you're right you know normally you go in 
[00:13:00]  and you'd you know you do mouth exercises before you do some kind of a commercial read but for some  reason those noises come out and i don't know why what are the mouth exercises before you before  you do like a commercial read you're supposed to like ah open your mouth really wide and stretch  it's just one of those things it makes it easier to make it easier before especially when you have to  wait yeah your mouth open your mouth wide get down on your knees exactly wow that's weird and then you 
[00:13:30]  get these oh i didn't realize yeah i know i understand sam wants me to stress that i do that  when i'm not in the production room it's not a warm-up it's not a warm-up when it's i'm it's a weird  i'm a strange person he's warming up to have a conversation that's what he's warming up for  not a vocal he does it in his little office yes do you really all day uh no i haven't done it in  ever since in about two weeks in about two weeks i actually laid off because i realized you know 
[00:14:00]  maybe making these noises isn't the smartest thing for an executive producer to be doing because not  only did i do as our executive producer do it yes exactly i'm sorry  he's all tripped up just go  i'll fix everything they're basically saying it's weird that you have that title just in case you 
[00:14:30]  didn't figure that yeah i understand that um i'm a strange boy and i make weird noises all right  sounds like your face should be buried in a pillow when you make that noise oh doesn't it  all right thank you i can't believe we're interviewing you about this noise  did we just interview steve for five minutes about this oh i didn't realize  so when did you realize that you can make noises like this what didn't you realize when you said that 
[00:15:00]  uh uh i probably that either whoever was recording like tim or derek like pointed at the stupid you  know uh uh computer screen to say uh that we're recording this yeah that computer screen that's  what's stupid yeah point at it all right steve thank you why don't we play drew boogie uh this  is the steve c don't worry be happy remix that has uh we took one of his noises and made a little  remix with it here it is 
[00:15:30]  so  so 
[00:16:00]  Let's say hi to Jeremy in Maine.  Jeremy, what's up, buddy? 
[00:16:30]  Hello, ladies.  Yes?  Don't make fun of my Eddie Vedder.  I know you hate Eddie Vedder, bro.  Let's throw a 20-year-old joke in there.  Why not?  His Into the Wild soundtrack.  You want to talk about some fine music?  Pick it up.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Eddie Vedder got the job done.  The movie didn't get the job done.  I guess it didn't do too well at the box office, huh?  No.  No.  I don't think it ever was released. 
[00:17:00]  What do they call it?  Wide.  Friday.  Friday-wide, right.  Like the movie Gritter, King, Gritter.  I think Into the Wild was shown in 10 theaters across America, unfortunately.  I like the movie.  But anyway, Jeremy, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to give you guys some props on Makeup Stuff Tuesday.  Yes.  Yeah.  I missed the first hour of the show, which never happens, and you got me good.  We basically try not to acknowledge Makeup Stuff Tuesday, except on Tuesdays when we let 
[00:17:30]  a lot of people in on the gag.  And there's a lot of bloggers out there that are onto us, so.  They reen it.  They want to be the ones that ruin our Makeup Stuff Tuesday.  That's not true.  I have to be, like, I have to get attention and let people know that I know.  I read one blogger, and he goes, I can't believe I have to write this for the second week in a row.  So don't.  Yeah, then leave it alone.  You busy body.  You stupid blogger. 
[00:18:00]  You busy body.  So I don't know.  I think the bloggers are onto us.  We might have to go.  I hate bloggers.  We might have to go underground with this Makeup Stuff thing for a while.  I hate them.  But I'll tell you this much.  Because we said the office was canceled yesterday, it was the number one thing searched on Google  for most of the day.  Yeah.  Good.  Nice.  Good job, boys.  Of course it was.  It's not just us.  The pests get involved as well, and they spread the rumor on the Internet, and it's an all-encompassing  thing that we do, and it's a lot of fun. 
[00:18:30]  But the stupid bloggers.  Where's the one where he goes, oh, for the second week in a row, some lady that works  at my office came in and said, did you hear Opie and Anthony and what happened today?  That's what I hear from people a lot of times.  They'll say, people at work come up to them and say, oh, did you hear?  And they know and listen to the show and go, no, stupid.  How about, and this one guy claims he's a fan of the show.  If you're a fan of the show, A, go, oh, really? 
[00:19:00]  B, and go with it and help us out a little bit, and B, don't blog about it and blow up  our spot.  No blogging.  Stop at your blogging.  Let the haters blog.  But if you're supposedly a fan of the show, don't blog and blow up our spot on the whole  thing.  Help us out.  Make it even bigger than it is.  And some of them are fans of the show.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  And they just blow it up.  Why would you do that?  Why?  You're a fan. 
[00:19:30]  But we got you yesterday, Jeremy.  Play along.  We got you?  We got you?  Yeah, you got me.  I missed the first hour and you got me.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Good.  Let's go to Dan in the Poconos.  Hanging out in the heart-shaped tub.  In the Poconos.  Are you in this champagne glass full of bubbles?  How did you know?  How did you know?  That's what anyone thinks from the Poconos.  Hey, can you-  Just people in champagne glasses full of bubbles.  Can you kind of splash around the bubbles as you talk to us today?  I'll try.  All right.  I'll try.  What do you got? 
[00:20:00]  Listen, guys.  Is there any way to break the mold on this Makeup Stuff Tuesday and make it rotating throughout  the week?  The problem is Tuesdays wind up being like April Fool's and people know to kind of watch  out for things.  But if every day is a different day of the week, it might mess things up.  Dan, you're on to something.  That's exactly what we were thinking.  Listen, if Phil Henry can pull off doing that to 10 different people who is just him as  a career, how could we not pull off one day of the week fooling people?  I know.  One day we got to fool people.  Phil Henry, yeah, he made a living off, wow, just doing the whole show as him. 
[00:20:30]  The callers were him.  The guests were him.  He was asking him questions.  He interviews himself in different voices.  Just an amazing talent that is not doing radio anymore, right?  He did almost as much show prep as this program does.  There you go.  We do a lot of show prep.  I want to tell Jimmy, Jimmy, I love you.  Funkus, I was on Instant Message last night with you, and I'm not in Michigan anymore. 
[00:21:00]  Oh.  All right.  Well, Jimmy, trolling IMs for young boys.  You heard it here first.  Makeup Stuff Wednesday, but this is real.  Well, this is Real News Wednesday.  Jimmy goes online and trolls for young men.  What are you doing there, Jimmy?  No, I actually wasn't on Instant Messenger at all, so whoever you were talking to, sir,  wasn't me.  Oh, so you're saying there was an imposter, Jimmy?  No, you missed the joke.  He was doing a little linger longer from yesterday. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, I thought he was serious.  No, he wasn't serious at all, Jimmy.  I didn't know.  All right.  Yeah, we're always bobbing and weaving, so we'll figure that out.  We don't want to be predictable, so maybe the Makeup Stuff Tuesday thing has to go underground  a little bit, and then pop its ugly head another day of the week.  Yes.  We could always switch our days around, right?  Switch it up a little bit.  Maybe we'll do one today.  Huh?  Huh?  Maybe.  Maybe that's what we do.  No one's going to expect it today.  I wish the Hitler Globe sale was something we made up, but I'll never own it. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, all right.  Get something else from Hitler.  $15,000.  What else could he get?  Belt buckle.  They always sell them.  I know what you could get.  Belt buckle.  What?  You could get the pancake.  I don't want the stupid Jesus Mary pancake.  We have that story next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning.  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday. 
[00:22:30]  Where are the Wowers today?  Are they out there?  I think they are.  They're out.  The global warming is helping.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's a lot warmer today than it's supposed to be here in New York anyway.  In your town.  I'm sure it is, too.  You know what I noticed walking home yesterday?  Leaves aren't changing this year.  They're not?  They have decided not to change here in New York.  I just looked out the window like I see trees.  The buildings aren't changing.  That's the concrete jungle. 
[00:23:00]  That's what they call it.  Yeah, we see nothing but buildings when we look outside our window.  It's actually a pretty good view.  Yeah.  We can see buildings in the distance.  We have the Boyer chick down there.  Is she out today?  Nah, windows are dark.  I don't think she's up yet.  Most of us have given up on fatty.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Jay in Wisconsin.  Jay, what's up?  Yeah, I got to see 3 o'clock in the morning a nice set of POW goodness. 
[00:23:30]  You saw boobs at 3 in the morning while you were driving?  At 3 in the morning in Portland, Oregon.  Yeah, buddy.  So there you go.  Wow's alive and well.  But wait, what did she do?  Did she just turn on her inside lights or something?  Yeah, she came up next to me, hot corn, and I looked over because I thought maybe I drifted  over in her lane or something, turned on the dome light, and all her unveiled goodness  was there waiting for me.  Do you have a wow on your truck?  Yeah, on the back.  There you go.  Nice.  Just in case you don't think this works. 
[00:24:00]  We could take calls like this all morning long, whip them out Wednesdays alive and well.  Tech fishing.  Yeah.  There's a reason that Steve sounds like that.  He sounds just like Mr. Hankey, and maybe there's just a little bit of resemblance.  Well, speaking of Steve's noises.  That is going so well.  Yeah, thank you, Jay.  He bailed on himself.  The noises of Steve?  Yeah.  Coke Logic already made a remix.  I don't know how that happens.  How did that happen? 
[00:24:30]  I think we just debuted these noises late in the show yesterday.  Oh, I didn't realize.  That's Steve Steve.  Is that awful?  No, I love it.  That's his inner turmoil.  That's Steve as naked as you're ever going to see him.  That's him.  I like it.  I like it a lot.  It's atrocious, and it explains everything.  Wow.  It does explain a lot.  Everything's explained.  And I'm sure Tim's down the hall now working on a promo.  Yeah.  Why does Steve sound like that? 
[00:25:00]  I don't know.  It sounds a little like his character.  But here you go.  Coke Logic came up with this, took that sound from Steve C., who does production around this  joint, and came up with this.  Oh, she's a pig.  Oh, she's a pig.  Oh.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  She's mighty, mighty.  Just letting it all hang out.  Oh, she's a pig.  Oh.  I like maybe stack.  That's a fact. 
[00:25:30]  Ain't holding nothing back.  Oh, she's a pig.  Oh.  Well, put together, everybody knows.  This is how the story goes.  Wait, that's not bad.  Quick.  Kind of like it.  Yeah.  You don't have to hear that for four minutes.  There you go.  30 seconds, and it's done.  Coke Logic.  By the way, Coke Logic's animation can be seen exclusively on onaradio.com.  Yeah.  His stuff is so good that I don't know why it has to be exclusive to onaradio.com. 
[00:26:00]  These are the type of things that you allow to go viral.  But for some reason, when they're put up anywhere else, they're taken down immediately, unfortunately.  I watched one yesterday.  It's Jimmy Norton talking about the livestock and them being slaughtered.  And it has done so well, and it's so funny.  The material's funny.  The animation is hysterical.  It's very, very good.  Who makes them take them? 
[00:26:30]  Well, I guess K-Rock here in New York made a deal with Coke Logic, but the problem is  that they can only be shown on onaradio.com.  But see, these are the type of things.  If you allow them to go viral on all the video sites, then it helps market the open answer.  Yeah, then people put them up on YouTube and all the other sites.  You hope that something like this could go viral and get, you know, a million views instead  of maybe a few thousand.  And it helps the radio show. 
[00:27:00]  But why?  It's just silly.  But I get in trouble for trying to explain things, so I should shut my mouth.  That's a valid question.  That's not a bad question as to why wouldn't you want to go?  I think it's great that Coke Logic's getting a few bucks to put these things together,  but the nature of the internet, you should allow these things to go everywhere.  Yeah, they got it.  Because they're really, really good, and you have the Opie and Anthony logo.  If you set it free on the internet, it should just be able to go wherever it wants.  Absolutely.  You can't have, most times it's very difficult on the internet to keep video confined to 
[00:27:30]  one site.  Yeah.  And if it gets out other places, you shouldn't take the video down from that one site, because  it's only hurting that one site.  Yeah.  Exactly.  But it's good to grab on the internet at this point.  The company that doesn't have the internet figured out yet.  A lot of people don't.  They're trying, but they don't really understand.  A lot of people don't.  It's this weird thing that people think that if you just put something online or whatever,  it's going to be viral.  People have really weird things with the net.  They try to protect certain.  Right.  But it's like, man, everything's free on the internet. 
[00:28:00]  You can grab whatever you want, wherever you want.  Even porn is dirt cheap on the net now, because it's just charging you forward or trying to  be exclusive.  It doesn't work.  Yeah.  It doesn't work anymore.  It's too easy to steal online.  Yeah.  Oandaradio.com.  You can see the Coke Logic animations.  But, you know, there's people elsewhere that would be turned on to the show if they saw  this on their video site.  Not everyone that's listening to us is going to go to Oandaradio.com.  And here's what you do if you know what you're doing with the internet.  I did something for Super Deluxe with Florentine.  We did these.  It was a while ago. 
[00:28:30]  We did these newscaster things.  And what they do is they encourage you to put them on your own website to get traffic  to Super Deluxe.  They encourage you to do that, because the way it works is if you see videos you like,  you try to find the source so you can find more.  Like, that's the kind of way it works.  You don't leave them exclusive to one site and go, well, hell, you better look up on this  site.  It's silly.  You mean Jim Quivers?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, well.  That's a radio.  I heard it was in, uh, no.  It's a radio bit.  Stop.  Please.  I'm telling you that.  Quarantine's not going out with Robin Quivers.  It's a radio bit.  Jimmy's his friend.  I know, but stop.  He knows more than, I guess, anyone else would.  I don't know anything about her, but stop.  Jimmy, ah, whatever.  You know Jim?  Yeah.  I'm telling you honestly that I've talked to him off air about it.  Yeah.  And I don't know how far it's gone or if it's a heavy relationship, but they really did  go out, and it wasn't like, uh, he wasn't talking like it was a radio bit. 
[00:29:30]  All right.  You know, honestly, I didn't get into details.  I should have asked him if they slept together, but I didn't.  You should.  I didn't.  I didn't because it really wasn't coming out like that.  It was like, I mean, I know Florentine, you know, for 15 years.  Yeah.  17 years.  And, uh, he wasn't, it wasn't.  Would it, would it, based on what you know about him, would he have, do you think he  did?  I think he would.  I don't think he did.  I could, I don't know if he did or not, but I didn't get the vibe that he did.  Cause Jim's, Jim's just, you know, he can't help himself.  He probably would have told me.  He probably would have told me.  But, uh, he was like, nah, man, it was nice. 
[00:30:00]  Like, he was talking about it the way you would, you would talk about something if someone  misinterpreted it.  Like, if you're like, wow, man, you went out with the chick, did you bang up?  Nah, man, she's nice.  Like, I just, I don't want her to know.  Like, they did go out.  Yeah.  No, I don't think you did, but I should have asked.  Interesting.  It's really weird that the two shows don't get along because there's so many, like,  players on the two shows that do get along.  Common denominators.  And have, like, relationships and, like, Jim Florentine and Jim Norton are, like, really  good friends.  Yeah, my first paid gig in comedy in 1990. 
[00:30:30]  I love Florentine.  And live together.  I love Florentine.  I'm sure that was a charity.  You know, Tim Sabian.  A charity fact.  Tim sucked.  Tim Sabian, who helps out that show, we're fine with now.  So, there's all these, like, relationships.  Incestuous radio business is what it is.  But the actual two shows don't get along.  It's just, it is the stupidest thing.  On the train back from the Boston, we did the Dennis Lurie Benefit Camp for Cam Neely  Cancer Foundation.  And I was on the train.  It was me, Kenny, and Artie Lang.  Rode the train back together. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  We just did the benefit.  That's just how it is.  It's just an odd situation, man.  Artie sat on one side holding a dog, and I sat on the other holding an XM logo, and  we just glared at each other.  Grr!  Grr!  And Kenny stood in the middle.  Don't fight, boys!  Yeah, he doesn't like confrontation.  I just want everyone to get along.  Jimmy's making a mistake.  Artie was the train.  That was a lovely, lovely ride back.  Was the train going slower because Artie was on it? 
[00:31:30]  So, anyway, the Coke Logic animations.  Oh, and they're radio.com.  They're amazing.  They should, the company should allow those to go everywhere.  That's how it would, that would help market the Opie and Anthony show in the end.  The company should encourage them.  And they should not allow, they should encourage them.  What you do is, you just find a way to get people.  You have to do that.  You should find a way to get people to the radio show and to the site.  That's smart.  Because you can't just put them out there without any kind of a mark on them.  Because then people just go, oh, what is this crap? 
[00:32:00]  Right.  We like it.  We don't know where to get it.  But you don't just, you don't hog something on the internet and expect people to find it.  It doesn't work that way.  No, you expose it to as many people as possible, whatever that means.  Yeah.  And then hopefully some of these people become listeners of the Opie and Anthony show because  they see the great animation.  It is one of our bits that is animated.  And then people might email it to a friend or it's on a website where generally ONA fans don't go.  And then some of those people become, it's marketing one-on-one. 
[00:32:30]  I got a novel idea.  Yeah.  Instead of going off on the air about it, let's actually talk to somebody.  Yeah.  I'm not even mad about it.  You think it's just...  Paranoid.  What?  It's just a silly...  I'm not paranoid.  I think that's a good way to go about it.  It makes for interesting radio.  We're talking about viral videos and why this stuff is important to a radio show.  And that's why I'm saying I think we should talk to somebody about it.  If anyone's heard this, please, let's try to... 
[00:33:00]  It's just...  It is great stuff.  He's really talented at what he does.  And at nothing else, believe me, I've met him.  He is a savant.  He's really good at cartooning.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  He's a brilliant...  You know exactly who is on that screen.  He does a good job of making caricatures.  Yeah.  He's terrific.  All right.  Let's...  Oh, you want to buy something, Ant?  What do I need?  You missed out on the Hitler Globe.  Damn it.  Keep reminding me.  But they're having an auction about the Jesus pancake. 
[00:33:30]  It's a big news story today.  Yeah.  It's on eBay, I guess.  Imagine seeing an image of your Lord and Savior in your breakfast food.  What?  Yeah.  A Florida woman and her daughter claim that's exactly what happened.  They say Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary appeared to them in the form of a pancake.  Now they want to share their holy food.  They posted the flat jack on eBay.  The bid started at $35, and so far, more than 700 people have logged on to see it. 
[00:34:00]  Logged on.  I don't know.  Okay.  I'm not buying it.  I don't know.  I just...  Start your day with a healthy breakfast.  Let's check out the truth.  Good improv.  Yeah.  Good improv.  You hear?  Because they're so scared, crapless to say anything that might get them in trouble.  He goes, start your breakfast with a healthy...  Oh, Jesus.  If I say Jesus, I'm going to be fired. 
[00:34:30]  These guys are usually pretty good at improv, but yeah, they're just scared.  They're scared to go after the Jesus thing and say how ridiculous this is, you know, where you actually would see images of Jesus in a pancake.  Say it.  It's stupid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It didn't even, by the way, look like anything.  Danny said it looked like water damage.  It said it kind of looked like a sheetrock wall with water damage and mold.  It kind of looks like, yeah, when your basement floods.  Yeah.  And the paneling gets wet. 
[00:35:00]  Right.  Near the bottom.  Here's the rest of it.  Start your day with a healthy breakfast.  Let's check on those roads.  Yeah, I don't have no...  I'm definitely not going on eBay to bid on that.  Looks like two little globs.  Good morning.  Doesn't look like anything to me.  But I am getting hungry.  Good morning.  Here in the New York State Thruway.  North...  Wait, is that Jill?  Yeah, yeah.  That was the guy.  I recognize the reporter's voice.  The black dude from CW11.  Yeah.  Oh, okay. 
[00:35:30]  I didn't realize...  Yeah, he's usually pretty good, but he left that one alone because you can't mess with  religion, even though it's a dumb image in a pancake.  He just saw his career flashing in front of him and was like, I better just stop talking  right now in mid-sentence.  There's a guy in India who married a dog to atone for stoning to death two mating canines  years ago.  That's what you do.  What's the matter with you, Jim?  How?  Does that help?  I don't know. 
[00:36:00]  He's, uh...  It's just because we're on religion.  He said he's been hounded for 15 years by the memory of a horrible act he committed as  a teenager.  He clubbed in stone to death two dogs he found engaged in mating and then hung their carcasses  from a tree.  And then he began to suffer.  His legs became paralyzed.  He lost a hearing in one ear.  So now he's 33 and, uh, he wanted to get rid of the dog curse and an astrologer said  he should marry a dog.  The dog curse.  He, uh, it was a stray named Selvi, was bathed and dressed in ceremonial orange sari with 
[00:36:30]  garland of flowers, and she was brought to the temple to be presented by members of  his family.  He married a dog.  It said, deeply superstitious people in rural India sometimes organize weddings to dogs  and other animals, believing you can ward off certain curses.  They went on the honeymoon with a jar of peanut butter.  What curses do you ward off by marrying a dog?  There are still people in this world that are just in the stone age.  Yeah, the problem is that everybody wants the world to live as one. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  How do you relate to a guy that's marrying a dog?  Well, you don't understand.  There was a curse on me, but then when the curse came back, the curse said, oh, no, he's  married a dog.  Right.  Just leave him alone.  Oh, okay.  I see it your way now.  You're an ass, sir.  How stupid do you feel if you find out that that's not true?  It was an old wives' tale?  Yeah.  You've been having sex with this dog for like six years, and you realize you didn't  have to?  You realize it's just fun?  You can't have sex with a dog, though.  Is it legal over there? 
[00:37:30]  What's up?  Yeah, I'm sure.  Uh, probably.  You really think it's legal to have sex with a dog?  They, they, they, animals seem to get a, uh, a lot of respect over there.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Cows are like very...  Yeah, yeah.  Marry a dog, I mean...  All right.  Marry a dog, have sex with a dog.  Why not?  In New Delhi.  That's right.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jody in New Hampshire.  Jody!  Hi, how you doing?  Hey.  Hola.  Hola.  What's up, Jody?  Not much. 
[00:38:00]  Um, I just wanted to make sure I had the right number for the contest line.  Oh, you're trying to win that $1,000 today?  No, why not?  Okay.  Hey, do you know the sound?  Yeah.  What is it?  What is it?  I'm not telling you.  You know the sound.  Why wouldn't you tell us?  We're the ones that have to push the button.  It's no secret to us.  Meow.  Why don't you admit you don't know it?  What?  You don't know it.  Meow.  I love you, Jimmy.  I love your show on HBO, man.  Have a good...  Oh, thank you.  Meow.  All right.  Excuse me. 
[00:38:30]  Meow.  All right, guys.  Meow-ing.  All right, well...  I don't like her.  No, well, this is the sound you're listening for today, starting at 7 o'clock.  Oh, boy.  I've got to...  Of course.  Dan, fix it or it's goodbye, Dan.  Come on, Dan.  Didn't they replace this?  Yeah, it's fine.  Danny Porter!  We're going to play that between 7 and 7.30.  That will be your cue to call to try to win the $1,000.  Barbara in New York, what's up?  Hey, I have a friend who has a toaster with the coils, and they're in the shape of Jesus. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, that's hilarious.  So they can see Jesus in their toast every day.  That is...  Oh.  That is hilarious.  So you can make every slice of toast have Jesus in it?  You sure can.  That's cool.  Tell your friend to talk to Jesus.  All right, you got it.  We did it, but you can sell it on the day.  Yeah, that's good.  I didn't mean to have timing trying to approach a joke.  I was approaching the runway, and boy, she just rolled a cinder block right out to it.  I'm trying to land now. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, but I...  Well, as Obi says, you know, I am a hole, so...  Oh, that's all right.  I don't say you're a hole.  Not to your face.  That's right.  No, I love women.  Uh-huh.  And they're holes.  I didn't say that.  I say, like, women on the radio, for the most part, are holes.  Well, probably women on the radio.  She's on the radio right now.  Oh, you got me there, I guess.  All right, thank you.  You're welcome.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's say hi to Yana, a girl from Buffalo, listening on the edge, the home of Shred and 
[00:40:00]  Reagan.  What's up, Yana?  Hey, there's a way to make a disposable camera taser.  Yeah.  Saw it on YouTube.  Yeah, it has, like, 700 volts.  I wasn't sure if you guys had heard about it.  We know about every little trend and thing that's happening in the entire world.  We just know.  We know that people are marrying dogs in India.  And we know how to make tasers out of disposable cardboard cameras. 
[00:40:30]  All right.  Well, I just wanted to call in.  And we know there are toasters that toast pictures of Jesus in your toast.  I didn't know that until today.  See, I learned something already.  Every day I learned something from this radio show.  Is that the Jesus toaster?  Yeah.  Hey, that's great, though.  That's going with a pretty good sense of humor.  I want one of those.  That's great.  I want Jesus on all my toast every Sunday morning.  All right, Yana, thanks for listening.  No problem.  Thanks.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break here and continue. 
[00:41:00]  On the way, we got some guy calling Jimmy Dean and complaining.  It's really, really funny stuff.  We got an alligator story coming out of Florida that's pretty cool.  Someone calling Jimmy Dean?  Yeah.  The sausage?  Yeah.  Not happy about the links.  About the sausage links?  Yeah, they're a little too small these days.  Wow, size queen.  And he can't feed his family with the small Jimmy Dean sausages.  And there's a good story about San Jose O'Connor.  I was just going to mention that, that we got to hit that story at some point today. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, it's fantastic.  How about we do it next?  It's Opie and Anthony.  Contest is on.  Opie and Anthony.  877-212-ON-A.  Don't call now.  We'll hang up on you if you call early.  Just wait for that sound.  And then you call.  That's how it works.  So you want to talk about Sandra Day O'Connor?  Oh, not so much her as her dirty daddy. 
[00:42:00]  But a filthy man.  Well, let's set it up with the fine news story that's coming out right about now.  Oh, that was dramatic.  Anything to work?  Well, enjoy the music for another one.  Come on, everybody.  You know this part.  Is it Air Guitar Wednesday?  What day is that? 
[00:42:30]  Well...  Damn it.  You never know the days of the week.  Well, it's not working.  What happened with Sandra Day O'Connor in the Supreme Court.  I don't know why I'm saying the Supreme Court.  You might wonder which Sandra Day O'Connor I mean.  No, no, no.  The broad that works at 7-Eleven.  Same name.  Thank God E-Rock's over there.  Thank the Lord.  No, it'd be easier if you threw a Jesus pancake at the CD player.  You get it, E-Rock?  Yeah, the Jesus pancake worked. 
[00:43:00]  You'd catch it like a walrus with a fish.  Not this story.  Ah, whatever.  What do we got, Jimmy?  Her husband has struck up a romance with a fellow Alzheimer's patient after moving into  an assisted living center, and they said she's actually happy and glad he's comfortable.  Yeah.  Which means, go ahead, Bird, and do what you gotta do.  We're glad you're not wetting yourself on the sofa.  Someone else can, yeah, take care of you.  I don't have to visit so much. 
[00:43:30]  The retired justice isn't jealous about the relationship with the woman.  She said that it's dramatically changed the outlook.  The son said that it's dramatically changed the outlook of his father towards being at  the Huger Mercy Living Center.  The focus of the broadcast report is Alzheimer's patients who forget their spouses.  Oh, wait.  So he's married, and the wife is still alive?  Sandra Day O'Connor.  Oh, I thought it was like her father or something.  No, no, it's her husband.  Oh, well, perhaps if the story would play, I would. 
[00:44:00]  He's in an assisted living center, and he just, yeah, he's got a new relationship.  Oh, that's hysterical.  Now it's even funnier.  And it's based on what, Alzheimer's patients forget their loved ones?  Yeah, and they said it's not unusual because you're in this place.  That's pretty convenient.  That's pretty convenient.  My mother's in one of those places for that.  Is she really?  Every time I bring Bonnie in, I've got to reintroduce her because she's just brought  up my mind.  Yes, that's got to be.  Your mom just wanted to forget she had a son.  Everything else she's okay with. 
[00:44:30]  But yeah, it's weird, right?  It's because they, they, she's, the guy struck up a new romance, and she's not jealous.  She's like, ah, I'm just.  What are you going to do, right?  How awful are you?  But you see your golden years being spent growing old together, and here he is dipping  it in a nursing home.  Yeah, but this guy, he's still, he's also in love with the dresser, his lamp, and breakfast.  That's true.  He had to be quarantined after a fist fight with two eggs. 
[00:45:00]  He's a fool.  It's Gertrude, you idiot.  I'm not your wife.  That's great.  So she goes to visit him, and he's got a, like a, he's got a romance.  I hope it's a sexually fueled romance.  Oh.  She comes.  Hello.  Opens the door, he's bringing him something, and then he's just there, doing what he remembers  from the past, perhaps.  His new light, his new girl's on the bed, and he's next to her, and he's humping her shoe. 
[00:45:30]  He forgot what he's supposed to do.  I don't know what I'm supposed to do.  Yeah.  Who's this woman at the door?  Get out of here.  Mind your own beeswax, lady.  I'm your wife.  That's great.  I guess, how long ago did she put him in there?  I think in 2005.  That's why she retired from the Supreme Court.  Yeah.  It was to take care of him, because he's been a problem for a while, I think. 
[00:46:00]  Who knew those places were like, uh...  He's been a nuisance for a while, right?  Oh, how awful.  That's got to suck.  That sucks.  Just put roller skates on the top of the stairs.  Several romances at the center, and people with dementia need intimacy as much as anyone  else, dementia.  That's what you want to hook up with.  He's also loved with the dresser, the lamp, and his breakfast.  He's a real player.  Oh, he's a tiger, this one. 
[00:46:30]  He's had sex with every piece of furniture in this hallway.  He's an animal.  But just how humiliating...  That's got to be humiliating on a certain level, even though you know...  I mean, I'm just thinking of my girlfriend, who's, you know...  We're certainly not that long-term, and I'm just like, oh, how embarrassing that would  be.  Do you still have to go there on their birthday and bring them a balloon?  Yeah.  Meanwhile, they're putting their fingers under your nose.  Guess who?  Plain guess who?  Didn't I just have sex with you? 
[00:47:00]  No.  I'm your wife.  Your loving wife.  I was trying to do the right thing for you.  As you're banging everything in sight when I'm not here.  You know he is.  That disease is just something.  Oh, my God.  Is there any sign that you can...  Like, does it build up?  Is there a sign that you can...  No, it's a light switch.  One day, all of a sudden, you remember nobody.  No, you know what I'm saying?  First sign is tiny hands.  Right.  I'm saying cuisine instead of cuisine.  And tortillas instead of tortillas. 
[00:47:30]  Why?  Do you think you're starting?  Yeah, I forget a lot of stuff.  Yeah, but you're also 55 years old.  What's that?  I've never been bright.  You're acting like you're Russell Crowe in fucking A Beautiful Mind.  Oh, no.  Why don't you just drop the F-bomb?  I know.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, Jimmy.  Isn't that weird?  Feeling a bit relaxed today, are you, Jimmy?  I'm Ken Comfy.  Yeah.  Ken Comfy.  I'm going to put you in that home.  I was Donald dumped. 
[00:48:00]  I don't know where I am.  It's a fine line there, Jimmy.  He's sparking up a romance with E-Rock.  Let's go to Nick in Westport, Connecticut.  He's a pretty girl with a big neck.  Nick, what's up, buddy?  Hey.  Not much, man.  Yeah.  I got a grandmother.  And actually, my grandfather just passed away.  And she, like, has just got Alzheimer's and crazy.  Has no idea what's going on.  You know, I was calling my father, Ike, which is my grandfather's name. 
[00:48:30]  And you go to the freaking Alzheimer's Center, and she's just got clothes on, doesn't know  when to take a shower.  It's just crazy.  It's horrible.  All you want him to do is go, okay, 36 right.  What's the next two numbers?  Damn, please.  I know.  Where's the safe deposit box key?  Right.  Unbelievable.  Give it to me.  He's smacking him.  Ike, do you remember?  Yeah.  It's like one of those things.  There's a case. 
[00:49:00]  I read about it in Reader's Digest.  I mean, it's legit.  Of a guy, I forget what he had, but he was a pianist.  He was, like, I think a musician.  He was, like, a really bright guy, and he married a woman, and he got some kind of a,  like, one of those crazy flus you get, or one of those.  Oh, boy.  And he has a memory, I think, of eight seconds.  It's like a goldfish.  He resets every eight seconds, and she left for, like, two years.  She stayed with him for years and tried to help him, and she left for years, and then  came back, and he never realized she was gone.  I wish we could get.  Wow.  I read that, of course. 
[00:49:30]  That stuff's real, huh?  Oh, it's terrible.  But if you can, look for eight seconds.  We can find that.  Oh, wow.  Is it terrible for the individual that has the Alzheimer's, you think?  Probably not.  It's all new to you.  Wow, who are you?  Yeah.  Nice track.  You probably don't know any better.  I think people with the, like, the beginning Alzheimer's is probably a little bad, where  you're like, oh, boy.  Now I didn't remember that.  But after you're deep in, eh, who cares?  It sucks for the rest of the family.  Everyone's still alive to you.  It's great.  Hey, where's dad? 
[00:50:00]  You know?  And it's like, nah.  Eh, years ago.  But everyone is who you want them to be.  Yeah.  The big black orderly is just, you know, it's Barbara, the first girl you slept with.  You don't care about it.  Hi, Barbara.  You know, it's some guy that did eight years on Rikers.  Right.  Hey, you want to play the Bill clip?  We can play that.  We haven't played that in a real long time.  This is going back a while.  They Call My Names Bill is a classic, classic prank call that we, well, Anthony did to a, 
[00:50:30]  what, Alzheimer's Clinic, I believe, right?  That's right.  We had They Call My Names Bill lost in the streets.  And he called from a pay phone to try to figure out how it turned into They Call My Names Bill.  Just from that one missed line.  Yeah.  Just listen for the missed line in there.  But now it's legendary.  It's now known as They Call My Names Bill.  All right, here it is.  Check this out. 
[00:51:00]  All-time associates.  Somebody help you.  Hello.  I have this number in my wallet.  I don't know where I am.  You don't know where you are?  I have this number in my wallet.  You're locked?  I don't know.  I'm at a phone booth.  Give me the phone number.  It's not on here.  There's no phone number on the phone?  Let me look.  What phone?  You're calling from a phone.  Is there a phone number there?  Yes, there is.  Could I have the phone number?  I believe it's an 8. 
[00:51:30]  Hold on the phone.  Can you hold on?  Don't hang up.  Hello?  Yes, can you hear me?  Who's this?  This is a cell.  Can you hear me?  Hello?  Don't hang the phone up.  Hang up?  No, do not hang up.  Hold on, please.  Don't hang up.  I'm going to put you on the phone with someone else.  Hold on.  Hang up what?  No.  It's cold.  You're cold?  I'm colder, yes.  I know.  Cold like Brazil.  I believe I need a changing.  Stay on the phone.  I'm wet.  You're all wet? 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, I'm wet.  Okay.  Well, you just stay on the phone.  I need a changing and my nurse isn't here.  And do you know the phone number?  I'm going to walk across.  There you are.  Can you tell me the number?  Can you see me?  I'm going to walk across the street now.  No, stay on the phone.  Who's this now?  My name is Judy.  What's yours?  I call my name's Bill.  Bill.  Hi, Bill.  How are you?  Hi, Sam.  You sound a little lost.  I'm going to walk across the street now.  You know what?  I'd rather you didn't walk across the street because if you walk across the street, I can't 
[00:52:30]  talk to you.  Whoa.  Hey.  Hey, Bill.  Hey.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Yeah.  Are you still there?  Who is this, please?  This is Judy.  Is this Bill?  Where's Sam?  Sam just went out to get some coffee.  I hate coffee.  Oh.  Sam knows I hate coffee.  Well, maybe he went to get you a coffee and he said he was going out to get a drink.  There's cars now.  A lot of cars.  I'm going to cross the street now.  You know what?  If there are a lot of cars, you shouldn't be crossing the street. 
[00:53:00]  All right.  Here I go.  I can't talk to you if you're on this.  I think my home is across the street.  Here I go.  Are you talking on the phone, Bill?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Oh, we should have called the police while we had him.  Well, he's doing good.  He's still here.  He's good.  He probably went to get by the night.  He did not hang up.  He put the phone down.  He dropped the phone.  He did not hang up.  Oh, my God.  Somebody call an ambulance. 
[00:53:30]  I told you.  Oh, this is horrible.  Oh, my God.  He looks awful.  Jesus.  Who is this?  Who am I speaking to, please?  Somebody call an ambulance.  Help over here.  The man got hit.  This is horrible.  We're calling an ambulance.  Can you give me the address?  He's a mess.  The man got hit.  Someone call an ambulance.  Don't touch him.  Leave him down there.  Hello?  Can you give me, tell me where you are?  It's too late.  It's too late.  There's bad spirit all over the road. 
[00:54:00]  Can you tell me where you are?  It's too late unless you got a shovel.  All right.  We'll get a shovel.  Where are you?  It's too late.  It isn't too late.  It's too late.  What do you mean it's not too late?  It's had us over there and it's all too old.  Can't help you if you won't tell us where you are.  You can't help anymore.  Just bring a shovel. 
[00:54:30]  Can you tell me where you are right now?  Disneyland.  In Disneyland.  Can you tell me where in Disneyland?  Pirates of the Caribbean.  And the Pirates of the Caribbean.  Yo-ho, yo-ho, a pirate's life for me.  I'm okay now.  You're okay?  You got all pulled yourself together again?  A car hit me and I feel fine now.  Oh, I'm so glad you feel fine, Bill.  You had me really worried.  That's all Bill needed was a little bumper.  Can you tell me where you are, Bill? 
[00:55:00]  Jupiter.  On Jupiter.  Planet Jupiter.  Is there a street number or a name on planet Jupiter?  23 Jupiter.  23 Jupiter.  23.  Okay.  Do you live there?  Send a cab.  I would happily send a cab if you tell me where to send it.  You tell them to make a right at Venus.  Right at Venus.  And it's Jupiter.  28 Jupiter.  28?  That's what I said.  Okay. 
[00:55:30]  And what are you doing there now?  Masturbating.  Oh, I see.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  Oh, boy.  It was by who?  Huh?  It was Mark Clean by Al Dukes.  All right.  The punchline after four...  The punchline after a five-minute bit might have been dumped out.  Who knows? 
[00:56:00]  Oh, my God.  Is it official or is it dumped out?  I don't know why they...  That was...  That would be funny if there was a crazy guy just looking in the streets and I said Jupiter.  Well, that bit played out for five minutes and then the punchline was just dumped out.  You know, the punchline's got to be dumped.  Yeah.  Even though it was played in its original form for, I don't know, probably off and on for ten years. 
[00:56:30]  And that context was pretty, yeah.  All right.  Well, what are you going to do?  Harmless.  What are you going to do?  It's O.P. and Anthony.  Rich Voss in the studio.  I was...  I told you about this.  We were driving to Delaware.  Yeah.  And a commercial came on and it said something like...  And then he broke in.  He, you know, molested her, killed her, and he worked for a major, you know, appliance place. 
[00:57:00]  And then they cut in and go, well, when we put in our heaters, we do background checks.  What they were doing was trying to sell their heaters, but they're...  I can't explain.  I know.  Do you know the company was...  Oh, my God.  They were selling heaters.  Yeah.  Did you hear...  And as part of the ad, they were using a guy from another company who had raped and killed a girl.  Did you hear this?  No, but I'm just...  I'm 39, so I know how to piece the story together.  Yeah, we heard enough where we can, like, help you out is what Jimmy's getting at. 
[00:57:30]  And they found a way to use a rapist murderer from another company in their own ad.  Yeah.  Like, we won't rape and kill you.  We do background checks.  That is pretty smart, actually.  All right.  Because I had no idea where you were going.  I was panicked.  Maytag.  I was panicked for a moment.  You really freaked us all out.  Thank God Jimmy was able to decipher that.  You speak idiot.  Speaking of speaking idiot, we got a little quiz for you. 
[00:58:00]  A little pop quiz, Rich.  This early?  Hope you're up for it.  All right.  Yes, this early.  Go ahead.  We're going to find out if you're smarter than a fifth grader.  Please, where's the fifth grader?  Huh?  Yeah, where?  Well, we don't know.  Uncle Paul.  Well, we got a test, right?  What a vera.  This is a test that a fifth grader would take, right?  Yeah.  And we hand it over to you, and you're going to, like, answer these questions.  No problem.  Don't you think we should have a little more time for this? 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, I'm going to give it to you now, and after the break, you should be done.  It's only ten questions.  You mean I have to answer them?  You're not going to ask them to answer them?  No, ask them now.  You don't need to wait.  We don't need to wait.  We just have to study this.  This is not, these are all yes or no kind of answers.  All right.  Finish the following sentence, Rich.  I before E except after.  I before E except after C.  All right, good.  Was that right?  Yes, of course.  Yeah, but that rule doesn't always work.  I hate that rule.  It's a dumb rule. 
[00:59:00]  It's like, oh, except when I'm spelling something.  Right.  Then it's wrong, and I look like an idiot.  I don't want to mislead anybody.  I'm not a great speller.  So that was, I just don't want to mislead everybody answering that one.  I spelled my daughter's name wrong.  I got to change her name.  Oh, I saw Rich Voss's daughter backstage.  He was part of Dennis Leary and Friends last week.  And by the way, Rich was awesome on that stage.  Once again, you were great.  Had a great set, but they went backstage and saw your baby girl and said congratulations 
[00:59:30]  to Bonnie, and she's beautiful, by the way.  Your baby girl's beautiful.  Thank you.  And then I found out that he effed up her name.  What's her name?  Well, see, here's what happened.  I was looking up biblical names.  Why?  You're not religious.  I know, but it's just good.  You're not a man of God.  How is Ezekiel?  God, he called her.  So I saw, well, the first name I saw was Basha, and nobody liked Basha.  Basha.  Basha. 
[01:00:00]  How can they?  Basha.  You don't like that?  Basha.  Basha.  I didn't name her.  Basha.  Basha.  Come here, Basha.  It's right on the globe.  It's where Basha lives.  Yeah, Basha.  That's awful.  Wow.  Okay, so Reina.  So I saw Reina.  Reina's not bad.  Okay.  Reina.  Oh, thank you.  So it was R-E-Y-N-A.  It meant pure and clean.  Biblical, pure and clean, you know, Yiddish name.  So like three weeks later, we had the baby, and he asked to spell the name, and I just  go R-A-Y-N-A.  So now I have a Spanish queen. 
[01:00:30]  That's right.  I'll be the first Spanish queen you've had.  So how are you supposed to spell R-A-Y-N-A?  Well, I spell it R-A-Y-N-A, but I got to go change it to R-E-Y-N-A at some point.  Yeah, well, let's go do that soon.  No big deal.  Let's go to Jay in DC.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, I'm a little confused.  How is it that if there's no rules against what some of the things you guys say that they 
[01:01:00]  dump out of what you say?  I don't get it.  What do you mean?  We don't either.  You guys say funny things, and there's no FCC rule against what you're saying, that you're  being dumped out on.  I mean, can't you guys do anything to...  Well, I'll say this.  The one they just dumped is an FCC concern.  Yeah, I understand that.  Don't scream at me, sir.  I'm trying to converse with you.  Sorry.  You're humiliating me.  Yeah, well, there lies the problem that we're trying to figure out ourselves there, Jay. 
[01:01:30]  I don't have an answer for you.  It used to be you just had to worry about FCC regulations, but it's much more complicated  than that these days.  There you go.  All right, boys.  Keep it up.  All right.  Opie didn't mention I closed the show last week.  All right, go ahead.  Question number two.  What direction do you have to travel to go from St. Louis to Kansas City?  I don't know that one either.  This is a test that a fifth grader would take.  And from St. Louis to Kansas City, you'd have to go east. 
[01:02:00]  All right.  Very good.  That's one wrong.  Well, it depends.  If you're going around the world, you'd go east.  That's a long way.  What is the symbol between the parentheses called?  It's the symbol that looks like the Procter & Gamble.  Yeah, it means...  Or A-T-N-T.  It looks like General Mills.  It's a General Mills symbol.  Yeah, it's that thing in the A-T-N-T logo.  Yeah.  There's a name for that?  Yes, the Basha.  Yeah, what is it?  Basha. 
[01:02:30]  What is it called?  Well, let's go with two wrong.  I have no way.  He just let the pitch go by.  Ball strike on himself.  We would have accepted the and sign.  What is it called, though?  The ampersand or whatever.  Oh, no.  A fifth grader can't say that.  At least the ones I've met.  All right.  Not bad.  Once you've met, can't even say no.  One out of three so far, Voss.  In dry weight, how many ounces are in a pound? 
[01:03:00]  Sixteen.  There you go.  That's easy, right?  Yeah.  I used to sell pot, man.  That's why he knows.  Yep.  Ask me grams, ounces.  All right.  Which of the following inventions was not invented in China?  You got gunpowder, you got cultured pearls, you got kites, and you got paper.  One of those was not invented in China.  Oh. 
[01:03:30]  Gunpowder, cultured pearls, kites, paper.  Okay.  I think I got this one.  I know disease wouldn't be the answer.  I would have to go with...  Wait, what?  There's a lot of disease.  How did that happen when no one even pushed a button?  I don't know.  God did it.  What are you talking about?  Disease.  It's not even one of the...  I'm trying to...  A SARS joke or something like that.  Yeah, thank you.  I didn't get you.  It's not one of the choices. 
[01:04:00]  Okay, I didn't hear the...  Gunpowder, paper, kites.  Kites like you fly a kite.  Yeah.  Are you looking at my answers over there?  No, I swear to God, I'm not.  I couldn't see that far anyhow.  All right.  Or what was the fourth one?  Gunpowder, kites, paper, cultured pearls.  Oh, cultured pearls.  What?  That's right.  Yeah.  I just want it to be wrong.  All right.  We'll take the second half of the quiz after that.  I would have said paper.  You know, and here's another thing too.  Tyrus.  You could ask me any of these questions this weekend at the brokerage, and I guarantee in 
[01:04:30]  Long Island, I won't get any of them wrong.  You really want these people to ask these questions?  At the brokerage?  No.  Are you crazy?  No.  Do you understand what our fans are capable of doing?  You know, answering as poorly as he did.  Daddy!  So I'm two out of...  What am I, two and two?  You have three right out of five.  That's not bad.  So you're barely passing, I guess?  No.  Is 60 a passing grade? 
[01:05:00]  No.  No.  That's a D.  That's a 60.  Oh, it is.  All right.  You're around a D right now.  We got the last five questions after the break.  Okay?  Pick it up.  Pick it up.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  It's Jim Norton.  It's Rich Voss in studio.  And we got a $1,000 winner on the line.  It's Claudette.  Hello, Claudette.  How are you?  Hi.  How are you?  Congratulations.  You won that $1,000. 
[01:05:30]  Thank you.  What are you going to do with the money?  Um, I'm not sure yet.  The holidays are coming up, so I'll probably spend it all.  All right.  Good luck to you.  Thank you so much.  As far as spending the money, I guess, I don't know.  She doesn't sound like a listener.  Huh?  She doesn't sound like a listener.  Claudette, are you a listener of the show?  Yeah, I listen in the morning.  Yeah?  What do you like about the show?  I don't know.  You guys are funny.  Ah, okay.  Claudette, you'd think I just started doing this yesterday.  He may have been born at night, but he wasn't born last night. 
[01:06:00]  What do you like about the show?  That's a good one, Jimmy.  I like you guys, and I laugh at you guys.  I get a good laugh out of it.  Okay, what's the kind of a bit or something you've done that you like?  Yeah, name one thing we've done on the Opie and Anthony show.  One thing you've done on the Opie and Anthony show?  No, I liked it the other day when you came up with the new idea where you started talking  like that other guy.  All right, a hardcore.  You're not even a good liar.  No, I listen.  I do. 
[01:06:30]  All right, so if you listen to the show, just name one lousy thing we've done since, let's  say, just moving back to New York.  That gives you 10 years of material to figure out.  Almost 10 years.  What do you got?  I don't know.  You guys put stupid people on the show, like me.  That's the one thing you could come up with after 10 years of doing this in New York City.  I don't know.  I'm nervous to be on the radio.  Yeah.  All right.  Claudette, I would respect you if you say, look, I just started listening because of 
[01:07:00]  this contest and you guys are kind of funny and maybe I'll continue listening after the  contest is over.  All right.  All right, Claudette.  Congratulations on the $1,000.  Thank you.  Everything's funny to her.  Yeah, absolutely.  By the way, I've never wanted to punch someone more than you.  Are you talking to me?  Yes.  What did I do?  You don't even have to say it.  You're driving me nuts.  Am I breathing into a thing?  Are you breathing?  Oh, my God.  All right.  I am going to punch you and break that nose and back into shape. 
[01:07:30]  So maybe some maybe we don't hear.  Well, here's I can't even do it.  Okay.  It's so hard.  You're going to blow it.  Don't do that.  It's going to come out.  It's going to blow a snot rocket.  Oh, God.  Okay.  How do you breathe?  Oh, my God.  I want to punch you so bad.  Please let me punch you in the face.  Please.  Don't sue me.  I need to punch you.  Oh, there it is.  There it is.  There it is.  You got to be on top of the mic.  Here it is.  Watch.  It won't happen again.  You know what it was?  You sound like a bull.  You know what it was? 
[01:08:00]  It was kissing a Nicorette gum in my mouth.  I was trying to breathe through my nose.  No.  It happens every time you're here, and you don't realize you do it.  So I'll back up a little.  It's not like I'm on a mic every day.  I mean, radio mic every day like you guys.  We're broadcasting from a wind tunnel.  All right.  You want to punch me?  Oh, God.  Please.  No.  I won't do too much damage.  I promise.  I won't take out your nose or your jaw.  Bust your snot logger.  You brag about your abs.  Let me punch you as hard as I can.  Why would I?  What am I, crazy? 
[01:08:30]  Tell Houdini died.  Yeah, man.  Don't do that.  Houdini was actually killed in a bus accident.  Shut up.  He said that so, as a matter of factly, like it was true.  All right, listen.  I'm very sure.  Can I say this?  Let's just say I did things last night when I was alone, and it hurts.  Ew.  Oh, no.  You mean right there where your hand is?  Yeah.  Ow.  Ow.  Chafing.  Ow.  Why did you?  You did what they dumped out of.  During that.  There you go. 
[01:09:00]  During that long, long bit.  How long was it taking?  With no payoff.  Thank you.  How long does it take you?  How long does it take you to do that?  It can be hours.  It can be five.  It depends on what I'm doing and what's the mental angle.  So, mental angle.  Why a problem today?  Because of the amount of time?  No, just because, I don't know.  It's just sore.  Just sore.  When you're done, do you go right to your computer and erase all your history?  Oh, reset on my safari?  I have a match.  Why don't you just say, Rich, when I'm done, I go to my history and erase everything. 
[01:09:30]  It's like, when you're done, do you do this?  Well, I'm not afraid gay sites are going to pop up when my wife goes to use the computer.  I think Jimmy's a rookie.  Are you kidding me?  Of course I do.  Reset.  Empty cash.  Empty cash.  Jimmy throws his...  Empty history.  Empty recent documents.  Oh, yeah.  Empty recent files.  There's nothing worse than when you're with somebody and you forget that when you go to  open a video, it will list the other videos that you've opened.  And boy, you have some quick erasing to do when she's over your shoulder. 
[01:10:00]  Why don't you just close this for a second?  No, because I'm auditioning for a movie and I'm trying to get the role done.  That's what you're telling.  What's the movie called?  Tranny Follies?  I'm a big black man.  Tranny Follies.  Jimmy basically throws computers away once a week at this point.  I was...  When I lived with this girl...  Just to be safe.  Just to be safe.  We bought a box of toys, you know, when I lived with this girl, you know.  Yeah.  And when she moved out, they were still there and I'm looking at it and I go, I got to 
[01:10:30]  throw these out because if I have a heart attack and my family cleans out the house,  they're going to really think I'm gay.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  They see that, you know, fluorescent, you know.  Marital AIDS.  Yeah.  Around the house.  All right.  We got a lot of people listening for Tomorrow Sound.  So, um, we introduced a lot of people to the sounds of Steve.  Yes.  The sounds of Steve.  Steve losing his mind.  Ow.  Ow.  What?  This is our, uh, our own Steve. 
[01:11:00]  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  I didn't realize.  Ow.  He sounds like a cat.  Yeah.  So, we want to use one of these for the sound of the day tomorrow.  Which one do you want?  This one?  Ow.  Ow.  What?  Ow.  This one?  This one?  Ow.  Or finally?  Ow.  I didn't realize.  Ow.  It has to be.  It has to be the worst one, which is that one. 
[01:11:30]  That, that is.  All right.  It's beyond anything I can even wrap my mind around.  This sound will be posted later on onaradio.com.  But basically, if you're listening now, you don't need to go there for the sound, I guess.  But maybe you missed one during the contest, and that's where you could go to find other  sounds.  Okay.  So, we'll play this between 7 and 7.30 tomorrow.  Oh, I didn't realize.  Oh.  And if you're the 10th caller, you'll win the next $1,000.  Now, Tim, our other production guy, he's feeling like Steve might be ripping him off a 
[01:12:00]  little bit.  There is a similarity.  So, Steve, uh, so Tim, so Tim put, uh, this together and ran it in here just a moment  ago.  Steve Khaleesi does a voice.  Ow!  I think he's ripping me off!  Ow!  Why does Steve sound like that?  Steve's stealing my thunder!  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, what?  My thunder!  Sounds a little like his character. 
[01:12:30]  Ow!  Oh, I didn't realize!  Oh, oh, ow, ow, ow, oh, ow, ow!  And he gets all whiny!  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ew, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Oh, God, no.  I don't know why.  Steve Khaleesi!  It's like, get a producer oping the anthony show.  They should both be burned alive.  It's just, it's horrid to listen to that.  I love it.  Just set on fire, like, with a match, 
[01:13:00]  like, with, like, a little latch that you have to hold under them  so it catches.  It's terrible.  I actually love it.  Although it's not as good as the Coke Logic thing.  Coke Logic took Steve's sound and put this quickie together.  Oh, this is a...  Oh!  She ain't mighty, mighty.  Just letting it all hang out.  She's a...  Oh!  I like a little sack.  That's a fact. 
[01:13:30]  I ain't holding nothing back.  Oh, she's a...  Oh!  Well, look together, everybody knows  this is how the story goes.  Ah!  There you go.  Coke Logic.  His animations are up on onaradio.com.  You're going to want to check that out as well.  You want more of your quiz there, Voss?  Yes, I do.  Playing the brokerage when?  This weekend.  Yeah?  Starting what, Thursday?  Friday, Saturday.  Friday, Saturday.  Long Island, Belmar.  And here's another thing.  I'll take...  My IQ... 
[01:14:00]  I'll take an IQ test here.  I got a...  I'm 141 on my IQ.  You're not 141.  You're leaving out a decimal point.  I'm telling you, I'm 141.  You're not 141.  I'll do an IQ test here one day.  Is that good?  141.  Is 141 good?  That's great.  Yeah, but he's not.  I think 150 is genius.  I'm 141.  You are not 141.  If you were 141, then you could pass this quiz easily.  Well, IQs are different than...  All right, but it's just...  All right, here's your next question.  Are you smarter than a fifth grader, Rich Voss? 
[01:14:30]  This is a fifth grade exam.  In square inches, what is the surface area of a cube with five inch sides?  How many inches would that be in square inches?  Five times five would be 25.  All right.  Wait, I don't even know if that's right.  That's right.  Of course it's not.  I don't know if it is.  Of course it's not right.  Wait, wait, wait.  Five times five times five.  No, wait.  Oh, my God.  In square inches, what is the surface area of a cube with five inch sides? 
[01:15:00]  Oh, 20 inches.  How do you know how big it is, though?  It's square inches.  You don't know how big the cube is to begin with.  Hold on.  Five inch sides.  So you got five times five, 25, and then times that by six.  Five to the fourth power.  Oh, no.  That's right.  By six.  Yeah.  I thought it was like five, saying it had five sides.  I thought you were saying how many square inches in a five by five inch.  Well, that's wonderful. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, it pretty much is how many square inches of surface area on a five.  On a cube or on a flat cube.  On a cube.  Well, let's say it's wrong.  120.  Let's say I got it wrong.  It is wrong.  Let's say hi to Sean in North Carolina.  Go ahead, Sean.  Yeah, 141.  Boss, that's not your IQ sign.  That's your SAT score.  Hey, hello, Jimmy.  Hi, sir.  Sorry about that.  All right.  The next question for you, Rich Boss.  What's the answer?  It was 150.  Oh, really?  Yeah. 
[01:16:00]  No fifth graders get that, right?  You have to take the 25 and then times that by six, like Ant said.  How do you get 25, though?  Because five times five.  It's a five inch square on each side of the cube.  But if it's a square, why would you go five times?  Because it's five inches across and five inches down.  Oh, okay.  Five times five.  What fifth grader?  A fifth grader goes to, like, a men's school or something gets that right?  Yeah, I guess, Rich.  You're right.  What event took the world to the brink of World War III in 1962? 
[01:16:30]  Oh, that was the Bay of Pigs in Cuba.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no, the Russian Missile Crisis.  Oh, my God.  We didn't know there was no World War III.  Didn't the Russian Missile Crisis last all the way up until, like, the Cold War ended?  Wait, in 62, when Kennedy was president, what almost brought us to the brink of war, you said?  Yeah.  World War III.  Almost.  Yes.  Well, it didn't happen, so it had to be almost.  Well, it's the brink. 
[01:17:00]  Saying it's the brink means almost.  I love how he tries to show his intelligence by going, almost, right?  Almost to the brink.  Almost to the brink.  So, almost.  Brink, isn't that where you skate?  That's what you do with your eyes.  Steve from Bayshore is writing, Voss times dumb times ass.  It's making a little formula.  Yeah.  In 1962, what almost brought us to World War III?  It had to be the Bay of Pigs in Cuba when... 
[01:17:30]  No, it's not the Bay of Pigs.  No, it's probably not a Billy Joel song.  I was born...  Okay, wait, no.  Bernie Gets, AIDS, crack, homeless vets?  No.  Five years old.  Yeah, I get it.  You were five in 62.  I think...  But, you know, you're now an adult, and you should know what happened in 62.  I know it.  In 62.  Mm-hmm.  Malcolm or one of them, they weren't shooting...  No, that...  How would that be World War III?  Malcolm in the middle?  Malcolm wasn't assassinated by a Russian. 
[01:18:00]  All right, what do you got?  The Ruskies didn't get him.  Oh, God.  I love how this comes right on the heels of his 141 IQ.  Yeah, what's your official answer?  My official?  Yeah.  Your final answer.  Your final answer.  Let's go.  My final...  In 62.  What happened in 62?  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  The Six-Day War.  No, that was in...  Oh, my God.  What was the Six-Day War?  We're talking about the brink of World War III. 
[01:18:30]  Complete annihilation of the globe.  And you're naming all these innocuous things.  Yeah.  That cab driver got robbed in Tel Aviv?  No, Rich.  What is it?  What is it?  What is it?  Can we come back to any of these?  No.  What is it?  It's to revisit them.  What is it?  Come on, Rich.  Yeah.  I...  It wasn't...  It's something to do with Kennedy.  No.  It's don't...  I don't want to 
[01:19:00]  I don't want  Come on  Marco the King Jr  Come on  Come on  You can do it  You can do it Rich  Uh oh  Here comes the gong  When I hear it I'm going to go  We'll need an answer  It was the Cuban Missile Crisis  With Kennedy  Oh  Did you say that? 
[01:19:30]  I said that was the first thing I said  Was it?  That was the first thing  Was it?  The first one you said was Bay of Pigs  You said Bay of Pigs  Then you said  That was the Cuban Missile Crisis  You said the Russian  No I said you go  Play the tape  The Pigs was not the Cuban Missile Crisis  Different things Rich  Bay of Pigs was going to invade  To get Castro out  Yeah  Well I said the Cuban Missile Crisis  Play the tape back  You said the Russian  Missile  No I said  You said the Russian Missile Crisis 
[01:20:00]  Two hundred dollars  I'll bet more than that  Because I know I heard it  I'm just being nuts  Russian Missile Crisis  You got singles in there  Why are you looking for your money?  He said it wrong because he's an adult  But I think I have to give that one to Voss  He knew what it was  He's just not an articulate man  We're playing by  No we're playing by the rules of  You know  Wheel of Fortune  I'm not betting  I got a hundred dollars right  Oh yeah you can't gamble  It's not gambling  It's a bet  How about if I'm right  I get to punch you  No that's gambling 
[01:20:30]  And if you're wrong  I get to  Yeah  Alright well  Do we give it to him?  I guess we have to  He just said it wrong  He's not an articulate man  Alright we'll give it to you  But your first answer  Was Bay of Pigs  Your second answer  Was Russian Missile Crisis  It is the Cuban Missile Crisis  I have a non-vote in this  Well here's what I say  Forget that question  Find another question  Alright here  Well you only got three questions left  Let's see if you can pass a fifth grade test  What is the verb of the following sentence? 
[01:21:00]  The goat ran into the barn  Boom  The beyond  The goat ran  Ran  Is that your final answer?  Yeah ran  Alright very good  Spell the opposite of vertical  Horizontal  Perfect  I gotta spell it?  Yes you gotta spell it  Oh but where are these questions?  Yeah I don't know where these questions are  I only have ten  I only had up to ten  We jazzed it up  Because some of those questions  Were kind of  Yeah they were lame  I'm sorry we had a revised quiz 
[01:21:30]  Wait hold on  Horizontal  Okay  Horizontal  H-O-R  I-Z-O-N  T-A-L  Nope  E  I can't believe you fell  I gave him the  The hand  The hand like you know  Come on you're almost there  One more letter  E  He goes  E  E 
[01:22:00]  Tell me  I love you  I really do  Bonnie's a lucky woman  I was right though  Horizontal  Yeah we'll give that one to you  I F'd you up  By going  Yeah yeah  Come on  And finally  Who was the US president  When World War II ended?  Get this right  You'll get a  Seventy on the test  It's either Roosevelt  Or Eisenhower  I would have to say  You almost said Eisenheimer  Like Weisenheimer  You're such an old man  No I didn't  It was Roosevelt 
[01:22:30]  Alright very good  That's wrong  By the way  Not only is it wrong  He was dead  Who?  Roosevelt was dead  At the end of the war  Of World War II?  Yes  It was taft rich  So if it wasn't Roosevelt  Honest Abe  So if it wasn't Roosevelt  Who was it?  Well the end of World War II  Was in the  Then it was Eisenhower  Was in what?  In the 50s  The end of World War II  Was in the 50s  And if it wasn't 
[01:23:00]  So you're now  St. Eisenhower right?  I said Roosevelt  Alright he was wrong  So you're now  St. Eisenhower  Well why would you  Give me a second chance?  I'm just asking  Yeah it was Roosevelt  Or Eisenhower  Wrong again  Now who?  I can't be wrong twice  Yeah because your choices  Were both wrong  The war ended  With the dropping  Of the atomic bombs  Yeah  Who dropped the bombs?  Who was the president  That was in office  When the bombs  Dropped on Japan?  No  Hiroshima Nagasaki  No he wasn't the president 
[01:23:30]  Hiroshima Nagasaki  Was not our president  No  He's the commissioner  Of Japanese baseball  Who was the president  During  Ouch  Yeah  Why?  I didn't hear it  He was Roosevelt's  Vice president  Oh it was  What do you call it?  Good  It was  141  Yeah  Go ahead  What do you call it?  Go ahead  What do you call it?  Roosevelt's vice president  Yeah  Yeah come on  I know you got this one  It wasn't  Spiro Lag  Had more brains 
[01:24:00]  After the suicide  What's that?  Nothing  Go ahead  Roosevelt's vice president  Obama  Give us the answer Rich  Well  Inside of your head  Make us laugh some more  Florida swamp  Go ahead  As you think about it  Steve from Syracuse  Has something  Steve what's up buddy  Hey what's up boy  I gotta tell you  I was looking in the shower  And answering the questions  And I think Voss  Originally was  You know he should be  Spilled on  Are you smarter than a preschooler 
[01:24:30]  And I think that  If Harry Truman  Was alive right now  You'd be kicking Voss' ass  It was Truman  It was Truman  I knew that  He just gave the answer  He was talking about a guy  He went to school with  Harry Truman  Harry Truman  Was it Truman?  Truman  It's too late  It was Truman  Was it Truman?  It was Truman  Nobody's really big  on President's tribute  By the way Steve  He's probably one of the  More memorable ones  Being the one that  You know dropped  The atomic bombs  By the way 
[01:25:00]  Truman  That didn't actually  End World War II  Oh it didn't?  Boy and quickly  It didn't  I mean what was  The World War  Where Germany  Was going and  Taking you know  Just out of control  That was World War II  The Korean War  Okay  That was World War II  Yeah  And World War I  And then what was the war  Where the Japanese  Were involved  And we dropped  Two atomic bombs  That was World War II  Where they got  They hooked up with Germany  Very good  Okay  But  But  Germany 
[01:25:30]  Oh no  Here comes the but  Maybe  Like I'm not really  On top of this  Right  Really  Yeah  By this you mean  Everything  I think  Here's what happened  Yeah what happened  Germany  Was still  Go  After we dropped  The bomb  Germany didn't  Just say hey  We're done  We still had to  Go in  Oh my dear  Sweet Jesus  On a cross  Oh my dear  Sweet Lord  Whatever happened  So you have no idea  That Germany had already  Surrendered  And the war 
[01:26:00]  In Europe  Was over  By the time  We really  Concentrated  Our forces  Over there  In Japan  And  See we beat  The Germans  First  Then we  Beat the  Japanese  I gotta  You know  I gotta  Read a little more  Yeah you gotta brush up  Do you think  The Germans  Just laid down  Their weapons  After we bombed  Hiroshima  Steve from  Yes  They did  I wanna get rid of  Steve from Syracuse  Listening on 95X  Steve you had a great  Line there  You wanna use it or what  I'd say yeah man 
[01:26:30]  Go ahead  Voss you need to go on  You need to go on  Are you smarter  Than a preschooler  Or maybe even  Are you smarter  Than a fetus  That's what I think  Oh boy  Oh boy  Well I mean  And as a Jew  You should know these things  Well ask me about  The six day war  Never forget  With you it's never  Ever new  Ask me how long  The six day war lasted  Alright  Six days  Let's say hi to Mike  In Jersey  Mike  It's actually a myth

[01:31:00]  What was it about  What  I know  Can you  Alright go ahead  What is it  What happened  What was the Bay of Pigs about  What happened was  Teach us  Okay  We were over there  This is why Kennedy was assassinated  Because we were over there  We had a lot of money  Invested in casinos  And over there  And Castro was taking over  Pushing out  Dictatorship  And we were going to lose  All our money there  So the mob  Pushing out dictatorship  No he was pushing out  The regime  To take over  As a dictator  In the country 
[01:31:30]  Okay  So the rebels  Wanted to overthrow Castro  As this was happening  And was seeking the help  Of America  And  You know  It's all history from there  I love just watching you unravel  I actually saw beads of sweat  Forming on your forehead  In the middle of that  I just try to remember  The godfather  The godfather 
[01:32:00]  Basically  Well I don't think  It had much to do  With casinos  At that point  I think it had to do  With a communist country  Being 90 miles  Off of Florida  Yeah but the rebels  Didn't want to deal  With Castro  He was just  Out of control  Well we kind of  Didn't want to deal  With Castro  Yeah but  And there was  A rebellion  Against Castro  But it wasn't very strong  So we said  Look we're going to  Give you guys a hand  We'll back you up  If you take on Castro  We'll train you  We'll give you support 
[01:32:30]  We can't be directly involved  So it was a CIA  Kind of  You know  Covert thing  I feel like I'm in school  I'm looking at the teacher  And when it finally happened  We kind of hung them out to dry  And didn't give them the support  That we promised them  And they wound up  Getting their asses  Handed to them  That's basically what I was saying  And it failed  Didn't people think  That that was a secret deal  Cut to kind of  To make the Cuban Missile Crisis  Go away I think  To make the Cuban Missile Crisis 
[01:33:00]  Go away  Yeah because  During the Cuban Missile Crisis  Missile Crisis  Yeah there is speculation  That all that's tied together  They were pointed at us  They were pointed at us  The missiles  Alright let's go to Tim  In Pennsylvania  Tim what's up  I just love him  History  You could have Coke Logic  Do an animation  With Rich Voss  With a  You know  World War 2 map behind  Him trying to explain  All the areas  I think Coke Logic  That would be great  Coke Logic will come up  With something  Mark in New York  What's up  That's the best bit 
[01:33:30]  Bravo fellas  That's the best bit  I've heard in weeks  And weeks  And weeks  We're not even trying  It's just the basic crap  Fred in New York  What's up  Yes  Is Voss smarter  Than a crack baby  Let's go to  Tom in Jersey  You got the phones lit  There Richard  Doing something right  Tom what's up  What's going on  Hey  Rich is teaching  Special Ed today  Huh  Well  So much for the phone  Joe  Save us  Hey boys  Hey  Hey boys

I'm a psychologist  And I would be willing  To give Rich Voss  An IQ test  Do you  Now from what you can hear  Does he sound like  A 141 candidate?  Absolutely not  Absolutely not  First of all  You're a psychologist  You had to have that nod  I was with you  You're a step above 
[01:40:00]  A counselor  And you're below  A psychiatrist  Excuse me  I have a PhD  Oh you know what  Nobody cares  You got a PhD  What do you got Rich?

[01:41:00]  What does he sound like  What number would you guess  Anthony was right  100 is average  I'm going to say that  Rich Voss is probably  Somewhere between 90 and 110  Which is the average range  Okay  But you know what  You never know on this test  You never know  See  Just like how  Well you never know  Because you're not  You're not going to paint yourself  Into a corner  Where are we going to get  The official IQ test from  Online  From Dr. Joe  Online  Not online  You can't get them online  They're not real quick  They're so bad online  Yeah she's got an actual test 
[01:41:30]  Rich  She does this for a living  I can administer an IQ test  I can't do it on  I can't do it actually on air  Because the test is confidential  But I would be more than happy  To have Rich come to my office  In Westchester  No no no  Wait wait wait  Why is it confidential  If anyone can administer  It's a stupid IQ test  If not anyone can administer  You have to have a PhD  In psychology  No you don't  Yeah we got to do it on the air  That's the beauty  Of this Rich Voss  Stupidity thing  I can speak about the results  Afterwards  Okay good  That's your psychology  What do you look like 
[01:42:00]  Hold on a line  What do you look like  Hold on a line  Because we got to move on  But we'll see  We'll get you an IQ test  How long does it take  Toots  Yeah I put her back on  Toots  He just took her PhD  Everything she's worked for  And just shoved it  In a bag of toots  Hey how long does it take  Honey  Quick  Next week we'll do  You, Robert Kelly  And Francine  In a  What are we calling it  A dumb off  A dumb off  Okay  Alright  Hey in studio  We got Jim Jeffries  A very funny comedian  Hello  So I'm at the  Dennis Leary and Friends thing 
[01:42:30]  Last week here in New York  And you just killed  The audience loved you Jim  I was alright  It wasn't too bad  First gig in New York  Two and a half thousand people  How hard is this country eh  People say it's hard to break  Piece of piss  Yeah  Not for Aussies though  Not for Aussies  No  Aussies got it knocked  In this country  No  Yeah  I heard we do it right  Paul Hogan  Paul Hogan  Believe me  Must be on top somewhere  First of all  Girls love the accent  Which is one of those things  Yeah girls do dig the accent  I got 
[01:43:00]  I got picked up  I'll tell you a story  I was in LA  Doing an audition right  This is  I walk out of the audition  And this girl comes up to me  And I saw her in the audition  And I said  What's the address of where we are  Because I need to get a taxi right  And she goes  I'll give you a lift right  Because she liked the accent right  So I get in the car  She's sitting in the car  And she looks out the window  And she meets me  And she goes  What's your full name  And I go Jim Jefferies  And she goes  Wait there  And she calls her mum up  And she goes  Mum  Hi it's Carla  I just met a nice boy  In the audition  But in case I get raped  Or murdered  His name's Jim Jefferies 
[01:43:30]  Right  Right  So I get in the car  Afterwards  I didn't ask for the lift  She offered me this lift  Right  I get in the car  I sit there for five minutes  And turn to her and go  You've just made this rape  Really awkward  Right  And she starts freaking out  And stops the car  On the side of the road  And I go  Look look  I'm not a rapist  And I go  But I'm really concerned  That you're more concerned  About solving this crime  Than actually preventing it  That was my first experience  With an American girl  So that was alright  I've been in the country 
[01:44:00]  For like a day  That's funny  That really is funny  And Jim Jefferies  I didn't know  When I saw you  That you were the comedian  That got punched on YouTube  I just knew  It was like  Hey some comedian  Got punched on YouTube  I gotta check it out  Yeah  But it was you  It was at the Manchester Comedy Store  It was interesting  The guy never heckled me  Or nothing  There was a woman  That kept on heckling me  Off to the right hand side  It was my own show  Right  This woman keeps on heckling me  Off to the right hand side  Of the stage  I put it down a few times  And then I said  I'm gonna leave you alone now  Like your dad did  And then I went  It's a shame  Your grandfather never did 
[01:44:30]  Right  Funny  Right  And then this guy  On the other side of the room  Had some issues  With his grandfather  That he never had resolved  And he waited  Till he finished his drink  Then he just ran up  And kept on punching me  In the head  Just like seven  Or eight times  Until audience members  Came and protected me  Was he a big guy?  I had a bruise on my head  Yeah  I had a black eye  I went back to the dressing room  My support axe sitting there  And he goes  How did it go?  I'm like  Not good man  Like I had better kids  Did you punch him back?  I didn't know  I was in a fight  He never heckled me  He just kept on coming up 
[01:45:00]  And hit me  I was professional though  I didn't drop the microphone  I held on to the microphone  For six punches  I'm confused though  Between punches  Did you call and say  If I die?  I'm confused by something  You said  You said seven or eight punches  Before the audience  Helped you out  How bad was your set that night?  No it was  That the audience  Waited for seven or eight punches  And went  Yeah I think we should  Hey he deserves like three  It was a high stage  It was hard to get up  Oh okay  You might want to explain  Because it makes it sound like  Maybe the set wasn't that good 
[01:45:30]  And they were like  Digging this thing  No it wasn't  It wasn't a great set  Yeah there it is  And the last thing I say  Before I get hit is  I go oh hang on mate  I was quite shocked  Yeah yeah  Hang on  The thing is  Paulie Shaw faked it  About like six months earlier  And when this happened  Everyone started writing me  Letters from America  Saying it was Paulie Shaw's bit  This guy's doing it for publicity  He's nicked this bit  He's nicked it  Whatever  This actually happened to me  And may I say for the record  No one's ever stolen a joke  Of Paulie Shaw  Ever  Yeah you don't want to be known 
[01:46:00]  For stealing anything  From Paulie Shaw  That YouTube is tough though  Only giving you  Four out of five stars  That's a five star video  Right there  Yeah  It's called  Jim Jefferies Punched  If you want to search it out  On YouTube  And we'll put it up  Are we allowed to put it up  On one of our websites  Yeah put it up  You finished your set  Didn't you  I went back on stage  And finished the show off  I just thought  Yeah  Why not  I think we got audio  Of the actual incident piece  Yeah  I'm not sure how  It's not too much  How it's going to translate  But let's  Let's see how this goes  That's pushing it inwards  Oh  Where do you  Oh hang on 
[01:46:30]  Oh  That's a definite ruckus  There's a ruckus going on  He's on stage  And the guy jumped up  And just really  Just threw a pie  You literally were blindsided  I mean it's almost like  There's no time  To even position yourself  For a defense  I never spoke to him  Or nothing  Was he a big guy  He wasn't that big  But he was stocky  He had a lot of power to him  Like coming up there  And just clocking 
[01:47:00]  Your blindside like that  Well there was a lad  Who was in the second row  Who was the first person  To come up and help me  Right  And he jumped up  In the second row  But as he jumped up  On the stage  His heel kicked into the face  Of the woman in the front row  And broke her nose  So there's this pandemonium  In the entire crowd  There's this woman  Just bleeding  And stuff like that  I'm off in the dressing room  Crying  Oh it was a tough day  Why would you go to a comedy club  If you're that sensitive  I just don't get that  I don't get it  It would never happen  At a Broadway show  Only comics deal with this  No one's gonna hop on stage  You didn't show enough emotion 
[01:47:30]  And start pounding  One of the actors  You know  Only comics deal  The other night  I'm on stage  I'm looking at somebody  Down in the front row  Eating spaghetti and meatballs  What other entertainment  Would you go to see that  When you sit and eat spaghetti  You know  It's just  Well  You know  It's also  Where are you playing Rich  Exactly  I was at the spaghetti factory  You were on NBC  No I was working  In a good club  It was a good club  Alright  They just happened  To be serving spaghetti  There was a food court  Where the heck  Where  Alright  Whatever  You think it over 
[01:48:00]  So then  Everything calmed down  And then Jim Jefferies  Came back on stage  I appreciate you  Welcoming you back  I'm not gonna be  Doing much more material  There's gonna be  A bit of swearing here  Oh it's peeped out  Yeah we gotta  Clean it up for this side  I appreciate you  Welcoming you back  I'm not gonna be  Doing much more material  I'm f***ing  Spanned out  By that  F*** completely  I got a f***ing  Ding on the side  Of me head  What many of you 
[01:48:30]  Don't know is  That I employ  That bloke  For when gigs  Are going badly  You're right on man  And the crowd  On the video  It's really cool  They're standing up  Kind of shaking his hand  It's like the crowd  Really did come to your aid  With what they do  Because people think  They don't know  If it's part of the show  I mean they see  That something happening  It's like you have to register  Like oh yeah  He's getting beat up  It was a hard way  For me to find out 
[01:49:00]  That I'm not good  At high fiving  I have no idea  I'm so bad  I'm a white Australian guy  Like I don't know  How to do  The first time in my life  Had someone give me  One of those fists  Yeah  I just grabbed his fist  And shaked it  Like I shaked the fist  Like is that  Is that the uncoolest thing  That anyone's ever done  Like you guys  Don't do the fist  No I don't do  What's the fist  A bunch of germaphobes  In America  That's what it is  They don't want  Their fingers touching  It's a bunch of germaphobes  Touching knuckles  So they don't shake hands  What's it called 
[01:49:30]  What's the fist called  It's kind of just the  Hey I don't want  To shake your hand  You're you know  Is that more  You're having purelled  Than a shaked hand  No no  That's very less  Very less  That's like  I don't really know you  But I have to acknowledge you  I've been getting  A lot of them  And Jim Jefferies  Is pretty smart  You made a lot of money  Off that video right  Yeah I bought the rights  To it and sold it  Off to the news channels  That's really smart  Good point  Hey we got to change gears  For one second here  We got Gavin in Wisconsin  It's wake up your roommate  Wednesday  Oh right  This is the guy  With the train horn

Of course  You know whenever it goes  Kangaroo  Or the nice looking ones  We'll go for the more  Irritating  We do that here  Yeah we say  Stop acting like a Patrice  A horse's ass  What's a Patrice?  What's a Patrice? 
[01:56:30]  Are you talking about Patrice?  Of course he is  Right right  He is an animal  I was once in a dressing room with him  Never walked the same  Let's go to Adam in San Francisco  Adam what's up?  Hey what's going on  Just wanted to talk a little bit about Voss's IQ  Okay  I love the guy  He's one of my favorite comics  I don't doubt he's a smart guy  But with a 130 IQ  And my own fair share of drugs and alcohol  I managed to stumble ass backwards  Into a law degree  Really?  You shouldn't say  That you'll lose your law degree 
[01:57:00]  You can't be a lawyer who takes drugs  So keep it to your sense  Yeah you don't stumble backwards  To a law degree  No no we all do  So what are you saying  You're saying you have a 130 IQ  And  You got into law school  Okay  So are you complimenting me?  That's all I want to know  Not really  Yeah yeah I'm complimenting you man  You're a smart guy  I think you're smarter  Than they're giving you credit for  I just don't think you're as smart  As you're giving yourself credit for  Well here's the deal  I raise two daughters  That are pretty much  Honorable students  So I'm pretty smart  When it comes to parenting  They're not just smart  In spite of you  Yeah yeah 
[01:57:30]  They got  Like the brains  No I gave them the opportunities  I gave them the opportunities  Where they could  That just means  They're doing a lot more homework  At mommy's house  Let's be honest  Your ex must have a 140 IQ  I used to do homework  With my youngest daughter  And I get so frustrated  I go you know I forget this  Your ex-wife's just sitting with him  Going do you want to be like your dad  Is that what you want to be  It's a concentration camp  That's how it could end up for you  Hey uh  We got that wake up your spouse call  Edited  So we could get a little of this  Yeah  On the air over here  Because the guy cursed 
[01:58:00]  But here it is again  Gavin waking up his roommate  With the train horn  This is the guy with the train horn  That promised he would call  Gavin  This better pan out  I'm walking into the room right now  I've got the horn  In the closet  Okay  This better work  Hold on there fella 
[01:58:30]  Oh man  Alright  There you go  That's kind of how it sounded  I think it's funny  With the bleep in it  Do you think  Yeah I think so  You're a fan of the bleep  No I just you know  Because you can use your imagination  Yeah  He only said the F word  But now I'm thinking  He said something a bit worse  Doesn't get much worse  Than the F word  Here on the  On the air  Unless you're saying  Uh  Fart  Yeah  Say that to dog  That's a bad one 
[01:59:00]  Huh  Nothing  No we didn't hear you  What was that  It could have been a good one  You said there's nothing worse  Than the F word  I go tell dog that  We heard you  It's like shooting fish  In a barrel  It really is  Simple  My god  I can't believe  You keep  You blurted it out  I keep leading you  To the slaughterhouse  I've never seen this dog show  We don't get it in Britain 
[01:59:30]  The dog guy  I found out about the guy  We don't get it here either  Yeah but the thing is  Just to look at him  Why were you so surprised  He said that word  No one was surprised  That would be the most obvious thing  That he would say on a daily basis  Yeah I don't  That's why I don't think  There's really a lot of outrage  It's kind of gone away  He's an ex-convict  People expected him to say that  He was keeping it together  And finally he just couldn't  Help himself anymore  It felt so good coming out  Right  Hey we got the  The Jimmy Dean complaint call  Who got this Danny 
[02:00:00]  We should get Danny in here  To set this up  We got a guy  He's calling Jimmy Dean  He's not happy with the  The size of the sausages  Because he has to feed his family  Where's Jimmy Dean  Oh it's a sausage  Oh  Jimmy Dean's sausage  If it's coming here  Oh it's not the actor  No no no  It was based on him though  That's a good name  Was it  It's a good question though  Yeah I know  They kill the pigs  By putting them on a motorcycle  And just smash them into a tree  I'm glad I bailed out of that one  Because I didn't think  I had anywhere to go  Yeah yeah  Wasn't it  I thought it was a friary 
[02:00:30]  It's like Jane Mansfield chickens  They put them in a little car  And they run them under trucks  Nuttlywood fish  Yeah  We can't get Danny  He's making a duty  A William Holden tequila worm  Oh here he is  What's up Danny  Not much  So apparently  This guy  Calls Jimmy Dean  Sausage Company  To complain that  The packaging  Went from a 16 ounce  Sausage 
[02:01:00]  To a 12 ounce  Sausage  But the price  Remained the same  And he can't feed  His giant enormous family  On a 12 ounce  Sausage  So he wants to know  When they're going to  Bring back the 16 ounce  Packaging  You're kidding  No  And that was his  A little complaint call  Well and we think  That this is him on hold  Waiting for someone  To get on the line  Yeah I don't know  If you guys know  But like when you call  A company  And they put you on hold  For an enormous amount  Of time  They can record  Everything that you're saying  The line is still open  So even though  You think that 
[02:01:30]  There might be  No one live  Listening to you  They can still record  That audio  Yeah if you don't hear  Hold music  Pretty much keep your mouth shut  Or you know  Say whatever you want  So apparently  This first clip  Is him on hold  Waiting to actually  Leave his message  Okay let's take a listen  That little 12 ounce  God damn roll of sausage  Supposed to feed  Your brother  And me  And you  600 pounds of men  At least  You get my point  And the two girls  And they put it in that  Pussy roll of sausage 
[02:02:00]  Son of a bitch  Somebody needs  Their ass kicked  Some little consumer  Geek-a-roid  Save money  Save money  Yeah save money  Save money  I'm gonna eat  God damn it  This guy rules  He's had enough  We're just trying to live  As one in this country  It's gonna be tough  I'm just  Guys like this out there  I'm just waiting to hear  The word Jew  Cause Jew is coming  Any second now  What you want me to say it 
[02:02:30]  It continues  Obviously  Right Danny  Yeah and then this is  This is him actually  Leaving his message  I guess no one was  Available to take his call  So he was forwarded  To an answering machine  Where he was prompted  To leave his name  And his  And his  You know  Your quantity  Of your product  Your products  Are very delicious  Love your sausage  For thirty something years 
[02:03:00]  But I can't take  And feed a family  Of five  On a little  Twelve ounce  Roll of sausage  I don't mind  Paying you more money  For your  Sixteen ounce  Roll of sausage  But you don't  Have it anymore  You've got a  Twelve ounce roll  And you've got  Three men  That weigh over  Two hundred pounds  A piece  A woman  That's a little  Plump  Scotch girl  And a daughter  Who's thirteen  And you're going  To try to take  A twelve ounce  Roll of sausage  And a couple  Of dozen eggs  And feed that  It ain't going to work  And I'm not going 
[02:03:30]  To purchase your product  Anymore  Or ever again  Oh  Sure he will  And a couple  Of dozen eggs  For four people  Just buy two sausages  Of course  Yeah  Now you have more  He doesn't mind  Pay any more money  He said he didn't mind  Paying more  He doesn't mind  Paying more money  Just get an extra package  Yeah  And then freeze the rest  I'm with Jimmy  The guy  A couple  Of dozen eggs  For four people  That's  Twenty-four eggs  For four people  Yeah but his wife's  A little plumpish 
[02:04:00]  A little plumpish  How big do you reckon  That wife is  That means she's a lot  Plumpish by the way  She's eating a few  Jimmy Dean sausages  She's sitting there  So he can't say  That she's a fat  Disgusting pig  Which is what she is  It's a family of slobs  They grade on a curve  Down there  Obviously  They'd be saying  A little plump  Where were they from  What was that accent  That was from the south  Yeah  Yeah  Do they  Do they get  This show in the south  Yeah  Yeah  Oh  Okay well  People in the south  Are lovely then  I was going to tease them  You're scared to get punched again  What's wrong with you  I might do a gig 
[02:04:30]  In Atlanta someday  Or something  I did gigs in Kansas  And I got the best heck  Of leather  Someone yelled out  Leave God out of this  Which I've never had  Anything like that  Ever in my comedy career  Why would they say that  I was doing jokes about God  I guess  I don't know  What was the joke  Was it good  I don't think so  No  I don't know  I just said I wasn't religious  And I didn't believe in heaven  And then someone yelled out  Leave God out of this  Why do people  Once again have to  Insist on interacting  With comedians  And getting on stage 
[02:05:00]  And punching them  Because they didn't like  What they heard  That was the club  Where the fight broke out  That was the joke  I go there  And they go  You did better than Richard Voss  There was a brawl  When he was there  Wait what happened  That's when the club owner  When the big fight broke out  When the club owner  Got his ribs broken  Yeah remember that  Danford and Son  That city stinks  The Kansas City Improv  The fight broke out  While I was on stage  Really  Two guys in the front row  Were arguing  Talking or whatever  And the security  Was taking them out  And the guy  Kenny remember that 
[02:05:30]  That was Kansas City right  The Improv  What a bunch of  Inarticulate dopes  In Kansas  Punching each other  We got the  Third part of the call  There Danny  To finish this up  Yeah this is  I just didn't want to  Leave it as one big check  So this is just  The second half  Of his message  Alright  And as far as  Your 16 ounce  And maple and sage  I don't eat that  I'm not from the north  I'm a Texas man  Jimmy Dean sausage  Is for southern people  To eat  With the breakfast  With the fried eggs  And the T-bone steaks  And I can't see 
[02:06:00]  Going to a little  You can hear the fatness  In his voice  I didn't know  He had T-bone steaks  As well  They got plenty of food  Yeah  And a brisket  It's for southern people  This guy loves  Talking about food  He certainly does  He's one  A few seconds away  From moaning about it  Is he going to mention  Salad real soon  No  No salad  No broccoli  No way  We like to scoop  Lard right out  And just eat it  Out of a can  No asparagus  Spears will be mentioned  In this phone call  Fried eggs  And the T-bone steaks 
[02:06:30]  And I can't see  Going to a little  12 ounce package  To feed  Four, five, six people  And I'm not going to buy  Two of those  12 ounce packages  Just because you want  To downsize  And charge the same  God damn price  I'd sure like a reply  And I'd sure like you  To go back to your  16 ounce package  On your regular sausage  Because I'm not going  To buy it  Otherwise  Ever again  I'll just have  My own damn sausage  Made  Like I used to  30 something years ago  It's not as tasty 
[02:07:00]  As yours is  But it'll work  Goodbye  He should hang himself  With sausage  This guy can't  Get enough  Of the sausage  I like the fact  That he's angry  With him  But he still compliments  He goes  I gotta give it to you  It is a tasty sausage  You are ripping me blind  But my god  It's good  I got a question  For Jimmy  Does this guy  Like sausage  No he doesn't  Like sausage  No he doesn't  He loves it  He loves it so much  But he's actually  Complaining over  A four ounce discrepancy 
[02:07:30]  Over five people  Yeah  The difference in their  Sausage intake  Is less than an ounce  And he's becoming  So passionate about  Buy the  Just buy two  Even though he says  Out of principle  He's not going to  I guess  Because you fat slobs  Delete it  No wait wait wait  If I would have said  That it's four ounces  A piece  They're not eating  One sausage  Between the whole family  He's losing four ounces  On every sausage  Which it's a six  He's losing one quarter  Sausage  No  It went from  16  Dumb as he  You think it's  No they're sharing  A big sausage  You idiots 
[02:08:00]  It went from  16 ounces  To 12 ounces  You've got an IQ of two  It's a big sausage  They're sharing it  They're giant  And you cut them up  Into like sausage patties  You ever see those  It's like a big  Hunk of sausage  Then no one's  Eating that by themselves  What do you think  They're all eating  A 16 ounce sausage  Is that what you think  Because your fingers  Look like them  You're as dumb as they come  Oh you know what  You're right on that one  I saw  But if it's a 16 ounce sausage  And it's down to 12  It's one quarter of  It's gone  So how many people 
[02:08:30]  Do you have to feed  A sausage  Let me get this correct  Well he's saying  Anywhere between  Four and six people  Four and six  And he's complaining  Because now it's not enough  And they're losing  Like four ounces  And soon enough  His fat wife will die  Of a heart attack  And then everything  Will be back to even again  It all balances out  Don't worry about it  My wife's dead  Your sausage is delicious  I'm going to be  Dr. Phil  He's going to get  Twice as much sausage  Which he kills over  From that massive heart attack  From eating all that sausage  Alright  We got a man calling  911 for beer 
[02:09:00]  It's kind of similar  To what we heard  So why don't we  Go down this  This road a little bit  Oh Katie in Boston  Real fast  Katie  Hey this  Goes back to  IQ test  Yeah  I just took one online  And got a  121  Okay  It's not that hard at all  Yeah did they ask you  For money afterwards  To send the certificate  If they ask for money  If they go  You've got an IQ  Of 120  Please send us 20 bucks  And we'll send you 
[02:09:30]  The certificate  So you can show your friends  Then you're an idiot  It's a scam  Of course it's made easy  No one who's got 90  Oh yeah wait till you  See the certificate  You shouldn't call  Somebody an idiot  Without seeing the certificate  You don't get it  Online  The IQ tests online  Aren't real  Well Katie's admitting  That she's dumb  And she got a 121  Right Katie  Oh good for you Katie  Exactly  Alright Katie's dumb  And she got a 121  Good girl  I like dumb  We're going to have  The dumb off next week  Rich Voss  Francine  And Robert Kelly  Bob will be indignant  Dude I don't want to be 
[02:10:00]  A part of the dumb off  He's  Bob does not understand  Put me in the category  With these guys  Dude  He could shine man  Here's a guy  He called 911 for beer  The state police  Get 911 calls  Here in Hebron  Brian Poulin  Has been to the office  Here before  According to the  Resident trooper  So maybe he was  Thinking of the  Package store  Across Route 66  When he called 911  Sunday night  To ask for beer  He probably should have  Made better preparations  Earlier in the day  On Saturday 
[02:10:30]  Why would you call 911  For beer  Yeah  Just go to a nice  You know  There is no you know  Inside of Poulin's home  In the Amstead section  Who was that  What the hell  Was that the local  Resident angle  Yeah  Yep  Local resident  Her quote was  What  What was that quote  Thank god  They got it from her  It really helped  The story along  Just go to a nice  You know  Good  What a dope  Good contribution 
[02:11:00]  Can we get her in  Next week too  What are you doing  Rich  Oh she was in the  Middle of eating  Sausage so  I don't blame her  She was  She was  Rich just had his  Pants down  Like to the  Showing his lower  Stomach hair  Nobody wants to see  That with your  Ant body  You're doing  Someone from  Their cell phone  New video  Five people  One and a half  Ounce sausage  Okay  I like that  One twelve ounce 
[02:11:30]  Sausage  Looks like one and a half  Though  New video  Five people  One twelve ounce  Sausage  There's the line  Okay  One and a half  Well it looks like  One and a half  On Saturday  Why would you call  Nine one one  For beer  Yeah  Just go to a nice  You know  Wow  There is no  You know  Inside of Poulin's home  In the Amstead  Section of Hebron  Maybe he realized  He was in no condition  To drive  But the man  Who came to the door  Said Brian Poulin  Made a mistake  And it's going to cost him  As he looks for a job  State police say  Poulin called them 
[02:12:00]  More than once  For beer  So they poured him  Into an ambulance  And charged him  With disorderly conduct  Ah  They poured him  Poured him  Into an ambulance  Did they  Really  At least he didn't  Drink drive though  You gotta give the guy  Some credit  Like you know  It's all swings  And roundabouts  He had a go  Yeah  Bill of Jersey  The whole point  With this sausage guy  Is a lot of companies  Do this man  They charge you  The same price  And then cut the amounts  That they give you  On the product  Yeah  Coca-Cola  Used to give you  A two liter bottle 
[02:12:30]  Of soda  For like 99 cents  Now it's a liter and a half  And the two liter  Is $1.49  And the other one  Is 99 cents  We got it  Hey  Then you'll get no coke  Huh  Yeah  Alright thank you sir  Alex  In Boston  Alex  Gotta throw those out  Hey uh  I learned  I learned today  That guys in Texas  Are sausage size queens  Yeah  Punch it out boys  Alright and finally  The last of the beer clip  He's embarrassed  For what he did  He's very embarrassed  Oh these are the local residents 
[02:13:00]  Oh good  It's always important  To get their take  They always can make  Something meaningful  These are the local residents  Giving their opinions  He's embarrassed  For what he did  He's very embarrassed  You're a major police force  What do you think  Of somebody calling him up  And ordering beer  I think it's a waste of time  For the poor police officers  What could she think  I think it's a great idea  This ought to be  What the police are doing  Instead of answering  Emergency calls  Getting people beer  One answer she could give  It's not good  What the hell 
[02:13:30]  Are they thinking  A journalist should just be shot  All of them  Should just be shot  When they ask questions  Like that  Wow  Calling them up  And ordering beer  I think it's a waste of time  For the poor police officers  That do their job  Someone calling 911  That's a waste of the troopers time  There's so much other things  That troopers need to do  And the firefighters  Emergency personnel  They do so much  For the community as a whole  That it's a shame  Oh my god  They need to be doing  Other things  Than dealing with  The drunk person  Calling 911  Really?  Those idiots  The troopers aren't 
[02:14:00]  Answering the phone  It's ridiculous  I don't understand  Why those local residents  Contributed nothing  That was bad editing  They didn't pay anyone  Who agreed with him  That was a very  One-sided report  They edited it together  It would have been  One bloke  They go  Do you want beer?  Jim Jeffries  That's the exact point  We may  You know there was  Some dummy  I think that's hilarious  Sounds like a great idea  I think next time I need beer  I'm going to call the cops  God I wish I thought of this  Of course  That's the point  Because they  Interview the local residents 
[02:14:30]  You know half the people  Are like  Why are you wasting my time  With this?  Shut up  Go away  So we got Jim Jeffries  Tonight, tomorrow  And Sunday  Caroline's  Really funny  212-757-4100  Here in New York  Voss is on Long Island  At the Brokerage Comedy Club  Friday and Saturday only  I don't know the number  It's Del Mar  Long Island  Good, helpful  That's a good phone number  Thank you, Greg  I'll be January 18th  The Borgata Casino  In Atlantic City  Tickets are on sale now  That's Martin Luther King

[02:16:00]  Opie and Anthony show  Hi  2.0  2nd edition  Part Dicks  Whatever you want to call it  XM Satellite Radio  Opie, I think, is not here at the moment  I believe someone said he was on the bowl  Well, when we left the CBS Studios  I did see him take that turn  That left turn  Out of the hallway  Into the shitter 
[02:16:30]  And I made a little joke about him  Taking a dump  And I guess I was right  I thought he was gonna take a quick piss  And we would all be here  For the start of the program  But, alas  He had a shit  I think this is his third shit of the day  Is it his third shit of the day?  Apparently he had a pot roast miscarriage  This morning  And he's been just  Poor little sweetie  Has been shitting  Yeah  Incessantly  I really don't know of another human being  That shits as much  I don't know any human being 
[02:17:00]  Who loves his shits as much  Yeah, it's very  It's not a personal thing  Like, to me  Shitting is kind of a personal thing  I don't  I'm not neurotic about it  Like, I'll go into the public bathroom  And take a dump  Just like the next guy  With my wide stance  And tapping foot  Hoping to get lucky  But, uh, I sure  I sure  Don't share it as much  The experience  And the, uh  Some people  Need behind it  We were in  You know the little dressing room at Caroline's  How small it is  Yes  We're back there having a meeting  With big comedy 
[02:17:30]  Central executives  I mean, you know  Me and Bonnie  And my dump manager  The bathroom is right there  Jason  Jason  Goes into the bathroom  As all the  And takes the biggest dump  As we're all sitting right next  How could you hear it?  And it's close  It's like, yeah  How can you do that?  Not only hear it  But then you open the door  You gotta kind of watch where you are too  When you're doing that  Because, like  If you're in a bathroom  Right off a room  Yeah  You're gonna open that up  And the stink fumes don't know  There's a doorway there  They don't know to stop  I love shitting in this country 
[02:18:00]  More than I do in Britain  What's the difference?  I love when we can find out  Cultural differences like this  There is a massive difference  You have a really high water level  In Britain and Australia  We have just this little tiny pond  At the bottom of the thing, right?  So I didn't know how long my turds got  Because they would snap off as they fell  Now, with this high water  I've been taking photos of mine  On my camera  I've never seen anything like it  And you don't have a plonk noise  Because it just  It just drifts in  Yeah  In England  We like our water 
[02:18:30]  Here in the United States  But the good thing about England  It'll scrape on the side of the bowl  And just sit there  And just sit there  And just sit there  And look like my career  Oh no, yours is much better  I've been  Or the Germans have that shelf  Where you can sit on it  And then you can look at your poo  Like it's where it's really  A shelf  They have a shelf  With a little bit of  Like a low level of water  Where it will sit on  So you can examine it  To see if you're digesting peanuts  Or whatever  Right  And then it will flush it  Off the shelf  Very efficient  Those Germans  Germans are obsessed with shit  If you're a black male 
[02:19:00]  With a wig  You can shit on Norton's chest  A lot of people don't know  I am a black man  With a wig  That wasn't a good one  Not a good one  That was okay  I couldn't hear half of it  Why?  Because you didn't enunciate it  You said something about  Something like  You had a mouthful of shit  Yeah  Why would a black woman  Want to shit on my chest  A black  He said a black man  I heard you  I got it  What's the wig got to do with it?  I'm very confused  He thinks  Like he likes  I mean 
[02:19:30]  He's saying it's a sexual thing  It would be so easy  To make like  Yeah a tranny joke  Where Norton's concerned  Because that's kind of  A running theme  But the boss managed  To just fuck that up too  Yeah but you tried to  You had a good joke  I did  Hold on  Where was it?  On 57th street  Walking over  Yeah what was the good joke?  Listen to me  Perish the thought  It goes on the air  Listen to me  All nervous  Carrying the show  Let me tell you  I'm nervous?  Holding your hands  And all fidgety  Alright  That's a sign of being calm  When your hands are folded  This is  I am  He looks comfortable  I am very comfy 
[02:20:00]  Of course he is  In this position  Stan is nervous  Huh?  Stan's shitting his pants  Lumbering ox  Just standing there  Not sure what to do  I had a good one before  I'm not going to repeat it  Go ahead Meg  I'm sorry  Go ahead  We know you had a good joke  Come on  We know you had a good joke  Come on  It's going to be a good joke  Everyone ready  Do it on the count of three  One, two, three  Good joke  Go  Good joke  Good joke  Go  Oh  Your hiney's got to be hurting  Sit down lightly  Why does it hurt?  Does it feel like there's a salt and vinegar chip in it?  I thought maybe you were pushing one out  Oh no no no  Just getting updates 
[02:20:30]  You just came back with a banana  Are they good or no?  Updates from  No updates  B-E  No I don't talk to him  From  E-L  Yeah a little bit  I'm confused  I'm just getting updates  Nothing new  How about that?  It was a waste of time  Alright  Where are we at?  Well Voss just was about to tell a joke  And he bailed out on it  I forgot what it was  I forgot what it was  Come on 
[02:21:00]  Go ahead tell a joke  Just say it  Who cares  Who cares if it bombs?  You're here  In a moment it was good because you laughed at it  When I said it  I don't remember what you said dude  I don't remember him laughing at anything you said  When I take a dump  In America  What do you say?  Well it's good  There's a big difference here than England  I go yeah we have toilet paper  Yeah it was a good joke  That was good  Oh I didn't realize we were walking down memory lane  I think I had a fresh one  You fucking jackass  You said it  Sorry I didn't realize it was a fucking best of 
[02:21:30]  Remember earlier yesterday when I said  What?  When you were absent there up  Checking things out  We learned that in England  Yeah  The water level in the toilet's very low  Yeah  So you don't get that like nice drifting into the water  It makes like a slamming sound  It'll slam  It'll be a splash up and your turd will break  They drop down like Saddam  And also when it flushes 
[02:22:00]  Water comes down from above and pushes it through  Your one sort of sucks it out  Yeah  And it has a spin to it  Oh I like it a lot  Thank God for the American Revolution  God bless America  Or we would just be taking these awful shits  Yeah  Your showers don't have  It goes right into  Water pressure  It's terrible  It goes right into the bathroom floor and drains  Like there's no divider  You know where  Tub  No there is in my house  I don't live in the YMCA when I'm in Britain  You know what I'm talking about though?  How they have them like that?  Divider?  No you know on the floor there's a couple tiles  Like the thin one between you and retardation 
[02:22:30]  See now that's funny  Yeah that's funny  He could tell that again in 10 minutes we'd still laugh  I'm going to sit calmly with my hands folded  Yes  Very confident right?  Confident  Very confident  Alright what are we doing over here today?  We have some stuff  On this side  What do you got there Jimmy?  I believe we had some stuff  No I just thought we had some stuff  No not really  We had some stuff we didn't cover  Well FBI says Saddam Hussein cried  At their last meeting  Yep  Well of course he was going to fucking talk 
[02:23:00]  Where would he cry?  Poor guy  Well he became close to this guy George  Pirro  Who I think is Lebanese origin  And speaks Arabic or whatever language  So they communicated  And they became very close  He spent like 7 hours a day  But he was the guy they sent in  Yeah  To fucking pick his brain  Yeah  He befriended him  And he got what he wanted I guess  I've gigged in Baghdad  Yeah  I've gone out and done the troops  And I stayed in Uday's palace  And we went out  And they let us play with like plastic explosives 
[02:23:30]  And all that type of stuff  Right  Play with them  Hold on  How do you play with plastic explosives?  The British troops gave us plastic explosives  And told us how to set it up  And set it up  And we're out in the desert  And we lit them  And the thing fucking blew up  Blow some shit up  We all had a laugh  And I videotaped the whole thing  But then when I come back into Heathrow  They swabbed my camera and my laptop  And there's plastic explosives everywhere  Right  The only way I could prove  That I wasn't like a terrorist  Is by showing the video footage  Of me hanging out  With the troops 
[02:24:00]  But also on that  When I was in Uday's palace  I did a mock me version of  A mock version of Cribs  Going through his house  With like a fake beard  And all that type of stuff  And it was  I was like  This is where I tortured my bitches  You know  All that type of stuff  Right  And so they've banned that  So that tape will never be seen  Why they banned it  What in?  Because you know  The British government  Were paying for me to go out there  I can't start like  Filming all the  The torture rooms  And stuff like that  That's frowned upon  Yeah making shtick out of 
[02:24:30]  Torture rooms  And stuff  Yeah it's not the United States  Can't you bring it here  And put it on here  Online or something?  I've still got photos of it all  Yeah the tape's gone now  The video tape's long gone  What was the coolest memory  Of that whole experience?  I um  What was the most interesting  You know what I mean  What stands out in your mind?  Okay this is  This is  I'm flying in a helicopter  Over the top of Baghdad  Right  And it's the first time  I've been there  I'm in a Puma helicopter  And I see like a little doorway  And the guy with the gun on the side 
[02:25:00]  Like Apocalypse Now  Yeah  I've never been in Iraq  Or Afghanistan  Or nothing in my life  Right so I'm freaking out  I'm in a bulletproof vest  And a helmet  And we're flying over the top  I see a little Arab bloke  On the ground  With a handgun  Just shooting at the helicopter  Just bang bang bang bang bang  I start fucking freaking out  Losing my mind  Completely right  The gunner turns around  And goes  Don't worry about it  We're too high up  Those bullets can't reach us  And then he went  Look at this  And the little bastard died  Right  Oh shit  And I was like  I was just saying 
[02:25:30]  I didn't want to upset anybody  Seriously  I saw the  It was like a computer game  Dude you pointed him out  Yeah  Oh shit  You killed that dude  You killed that guy  I didn't mean to  You probably saved someone  Good for you  Good for you  You probably saved someone  The next guy coming out  He was a fucking shot  Yeah but I think  He probably has  Some nightmares  I wasn't happy  And then I  I told the  I told the  I told the stage  Like that night  And all the soldiers 
[02:26:00]  Like yeah brilliant  I was saying this before man  The American soldiers  Are fucking mental man  You meet an American soldier  And you go why are you out here  And they're going to fight for freedom  And tyranny  And for the flag  You meet a British soldier  And go why are you out here  And they go  I didn't do good at school  I just didn't try hard enough me  Hey speaking of the army  You're doing a show over there  Called what  Celebrity army  You were saying  I'm doing  During the break  I'm doing like  Celebrity boot camp  Celebrity boot camp  Yeah yeah  Where they  They're just gonna make me run on pills

What is that in kilos  Or stones?  Oh Christ  What are you  You're talking that  Wacky European measurement  That's 200 stone  200 stone  I'm like 14 stones  Why won't you learn  Our weight?  He's saying  Why are you  Telling his weight  In money  Pounds  You and your pounds  How many stones is that?  How many stone 
[02:42:30]  How many kilos?  Yeah  I would say  400 pounds  Is probably  About  630 kilos  That's about  No  I'm 90 kilos  You know  You can't play that  I'm like  He's six times bigger than me  It's about three years  Of your fish and chip dinners  That he's been eating  Yeah right  Of just oil and grease  Lovely  I went the wrong way  It's the other way  It's the other way  Then he's probably  280 kilos 
[02:43:00]  Picture the Edmund  If it's Gerald  Oh Christ  I got an iPhone  I could have figured that out too  I'm gonna go with  He's 390 pounds  In America  400  400  Just say 400  I'm saying  That's gonna be  About  30 stone  30 stone  No no no  30 stone  About 25 stone  Then I guess  22 stone  Stone  Well how big are the stones?  That's fucking big man  What if the stones  Are different sizes? 
[02:43:30]  Oh man  Never understood that  I got kilos  Oh you got kilos  Are we doing kilos?  How many kilos is Big A?  Okay okay  14 kilos is 90  90 kilos is 14 stone  Wait I'm gonna  What the fuck's a stone?  Yeah what's a fucking stone?  It's a stone  It's a fucking  It's a measurement of weight  If you're a two building pyramid  I don't like when you try to be clever  I bet you I went back to the oldie measurement  Where they'd find a whole lot of stones  That were similar sizes  And they'd go  That's it  It's like how they measure things in feet  So you're basically saying 
[02:44:00]  We could skip him across a pond  12 inches  12 inches  Yeah but not everyone's foot  I'm gonna guess  He's making a good point here  That was like a king's foot or something  That they went  Alright that was  You know  I'm guessing 32 kilos  He's not 32 kilos  Oh a stone  More than that  No  Yeah how much is he?  Wait wait wait  I say he's 100  I'm 90 kilos  No no no he's  He's 228 kilos  What?  Shit 
[02:44:30]  I should've sticked with my first one  Either way he's very close to death  180  180 kilos  Very close to death  It doesn't matter what measurement you put it in  The result's the same  Ah shit you know  I should've just gone with something  I used to know about  And thought of what he would look like  Filled up with cocaine  And I could've gotten the whole kilo thing  You know what though  Hold on  When it comes to England  You're in shape though  180's not bad  You're in shape  180  You should move over there  You're in shape  This is a true story  I go get my blood pressure checked in Australia right 
[02:45:00]  And the doctor says my blood pressure's too high  And then I have to go on medication  And I get it checked again  So I go over to England right  And they check it  I get exactly the same readout  But because the English are such fat cunts right  It turned out that I was a healthy Englishman  Their standards were different right  So I'm an unhealthy Australian  But I'm a healthy Englishman right  So every time I get sicker  I'm moving to a shittier country  Until eventually I'm the healthiest man in Rwanda  And there's just going to be some doctor going  You've only got HIV 
[02:45:30]  It's not even AIDS  Do you want to join the soccer team?  Yeah that's like the flu to me and you  You get the AIDS down there in Africa  Hey Big A  Someone wants to say  Want you to say  I don't have a stupid ST day  Uh oh  By the way Jim Jefferies  This is the beauty of Big A right here  He can't say ST words  Just to let you in on the game  Okay  So I don't have a stupid ST day  Good start 
[02:46:00]  I don't have a stupid STD  That's why he  I believe him  That's why he's big  Because when he's eating  He can't tell himself  Stop  Yeah  Stop  There you go  So what are you  You're a little lonely huh?  I like him  Yeah  This is disturbing  Yeah it is a little  When's the last time

[02:47:00]  That we should get someone  To eat  Big A's ass  I certainly  Big A would you be  Into a girl  Eating your ass  A bit of rimming  A little lick  Swabbing between those  Delicious cheeks  With her tongue  Oh fuck  A little pungent I'm sure  But so what  Let her toughen up  That's how she learns  Andrew  You get on your hands  And knees on that couch  And you slide those pants down  To mid thigh  And you get that 
[02:47:30]  Fucking ass  Swabbed out  What do you say  I like licking ass  But my anus  Is a little bit  Doesn't look very good  I always get conscious  Of people  Really?  Yeah one of the sides  Of my anus  Is more swollen up  Than the other  It looks like my  Asshole's had a stroke  So big A what do you say  I don't know  I've never had this 
[02:48:00]  Yeah but just because  You haven't had it  Doesn't mean that  You don't want it  Would you let a girl  Put like a strap on  Or put  No no  Okay  You're never gonna  Find love that way  You gotta be open  To suggestion  No big A  Not into that  I see  Blue Heeler is suggesting  Two girls  One tub  Move  Move  E  No

[02:49:00]  Lemon entry my dear  Watson  With the  It's a single still picture  It has nothing  It's not a video  And all we ask is  Who is the gayest guy  In this  No no no  It's not the gayest guy  Who would you want to be  The question is  If you had to be someone  In this picture  Who would it be  Who would it be  Alright  Alright  Alright  Pick and choose  There's three  Older gentlemen  Would you rather be  Arnold Palmer  Arnold Palmer  Down at the bottom 
[02:49:30]  Ex-New York mayor  Ed Koch  Who's laying down  I'd be the one  Kissing and caressing  You would be kissing guy  I don't have a cock  In my mouth  He's got his eyes shut  He's a happy person  He's in his happy space  But he's not getting  Any pleasure  Out of that  Ed Koch at least  He's gotta kiss the guy  But at least  He's getting his dick sucked  He's sure that's a real photo  And not super in pose  They're all such lucky devils  The guy in the middle 
[02:50:00]  Is the lucky one  Because he's getting  Everything  He's getting his tongue swabbed  He's getting his nipple  Played with  He's got a mouth  On his cock  A hand on his leg  He's just being serviced  By the way  That's Sandra Day O'Connor's  Husband  That's the new love  That's  I was going  In the corner  Sandra Day going  Frank  She's just happy  He's not complaining anymore  I knew you were going for it  Did you say  I find this  A beautiful picture  We never think  Of the old gay men 
[02:50:30]  Fucking each other  I like to see  In their older life  They're still having  A bit of fun  And getting on with things  That inspires me  That picture  He's got a big unit too  For an old guy  Who knows  The red lipped  Fucking man on the end  You can't really tell  If you got sucked off  By that guy  You'd get that hard as well  Man  He's fucking  He's a good looking  What do they do though  After everyone just  Shoots the load  And you're kind of  Feeling like  They wait to dust  They wipe the dust  Off the other guy's chest  They probably call  Their grandchildren  Yeah  I love you 
[02:51:00]  They probably go back  On the golf course  Look at the tans  Yeah they got golf tans  Yeah they have golf tans  The guy on his back  They actually put him  Back in the fucking freezer  Because he's dead  The other two fucking  Are creepy homoerotic germans  And they fuck dead men  They want to save that guy  For a few more sessions  Before I start smelling  He rots  I assume anal sex  Is off the table 
[02:51:30]  By that age though  Isn't it  No necessarily  Ass sex  Like I've always said  Ass sex is for the young  It's for the young  Once you get a lot  Of hemorrhoids and stuff  You ain't  I'm over putting things  Up me ass  You know what I mean  I'm 30 years old  If you get too much stuff  In my early 20s  I was doing things  With my ass all day  But now  I'm not even interested  What would you do  With your ass  All day  Put things up there  Just when you're having a wank  Or something like that  You know what I mean  Put a hairbrush  Just something  Just you know  Just you're home  You're alone  And you've got some lube  And you just put something up 
[02:52:00]  I'm not gay  I'm just  You just shove something  Up your ass  While you're cracking  I'm a fun guy  I'm a fun guy  That's all  Alright  Hey where's  Where's his comedy  We want to play that  Going into break  We have it yet  We don't know  It's quite a long clip  Maybe it was the wrong clip  To show  Anybody know  Van  I should have brought a CD in  We got it  Yeah it's like six minutes  Five or six minutes long  It's alright  It's burning right now  Oh it's burning  How long will it take  Why am I looking at this  I'm fascinated by this stupid picture 
[02:52:30]  Because I'm trying to figure out  Like the origin of it  I just want to know  Where they all met  Have they known each other for years  Were they childhood friends  Or is this a recent thing  Yeah  Is that a hotel room  Is it one of their rooms  Or is it  I'll tell you what it is  They all met in the waiting room  They were having designer  Colostomy bags made  And they all met in the hotel room  Because the stitching  Takes so long to get right  What am I talking about  I just don't understand  I just don't understand  How one of them is flaccid  Like  What's wrong with him 
[02:53:00]  This is the horniest scene ever  How can he not have an election  What does it take  For that guy to get a boner  What does it take  Yeah I know  Like how many men in the room  Does he need  Surgery in a pump  Also my computer is completely frozen  So I can't  Oh great  If you want me to take that down  You can't take that down  Can you  No we were trying to move on  Usually you get rid of the picture  It's easier to move on  Yeah  Randy Houston  What's up  I think you guys need to play him  And introduce him to  Wheelchair Fred  And his bathtub experience  Yeah one of the greatest bits  God damn  I forgot about that  One of the greatest bits 
[02:53:30]  We ever did Jim Jeffries  We have this guy  He was in a motorcycle accident  So he's in a wheelchair  For good  Oh it sounds like a lot of fun  And he doesn't have much  Strength  But one day  Live on our show  He was able to get his body  Into a bathtub  And fuck himself up the ass  What  With a dildo  Oh with a dildo  I thought maybe  The accident gave him super powers  No  But why did you put him in a bathtub  Why did he have to do that  In a bathtub  He just decided that  It would make clean up  A little easier  Did he have any sensation 
[02:54:00]  In his arm  I guess if they're paralyzed  It makes it a little easier  To clean up  If you do it in a bathtub  See I don't even know  That paralyzed people  Can they feel anal sex  Can they  You know  Some of them can have sex  Some of them can  Well I wouldn't think so  All the charges are filed  Because if I was paralyzed  From the waist down  I'd let people  Fuck me up the ass  As a community service  Absolutely  Throw a bucket  Throw a bucket on the table  It's not going to hurt me  I've got time in my hands  It's not like I can  Go back to work  You're a trooper man  That's nice  That's very nice of you  I try to help in the community  Let me tell you something  Well wheelchair friend 
[02:54:30]  He's actually not paralyzed  His legs were mangled  So bad from the motorcycle accident  He didn't have the right health care  So he couldn't get his legs  Back in working order  So I guess he's not  Officially paralyzed  But he's a mess  Right right  I think we're going to replay that  At 11 o'clock  When we get out of here today  He couldn't  Yeah  I was right man  Will you let a guy blow you  Oh no  No  No  Why not  Why'd you say um  Why not  What's your reasoning  You gotta have a reason  How about if he promised 
[02:55:00]  To fucking  To just fucking  Empty your ball bag  What if he had a hamburger  Absolutely  Not  How about if he promised  To play with that  Vein  From your balls  To your ass  And he promised  To empty your bag  It would look like  Fucking Reagan's neck  When he was finished with it  Taco Bell voucher  I hear  I hear potential though  I hear this is a possibility  What if your eyes  Were closed the whole time  So you don't know  It's a good one  No  No  And he promised  Not to make  Man moaning noises  Like  Yeah you shut your eyes 
[02:55:30]  You just picture  That it's a woman  And uh  It's done  Done deal  How about you  Drill a hole in a wall  And make a fake wall  And we'll drill a hole  Oh there you go  Oh I love those  I've done that  Have you  Yeah  Glory hole  I've put  I've put me  No  No I haven't  No I'm gonna  Take that back  I've done one of those  Which end  Which end  Yeah  I'll tell you  The weirdest thing  Obviously  They have this  Like sleazeball ball 
[02:56:00]  In Sydney  After the gay  Marty guy  And there's this guy  And he's dead now  He died of some type  Of hepatitis  But he called himself  The trough junkie  And he used to  Lay in the urinal trough  Right  Just lay there  For like six hours  And everyone would  Go piss on him  Like  Holy shit  And you need to  Have a piss  I pissed on him  You know  You need to go  And the guy  He was in heaven  Did he judge off  Yeah  No he was just there  Wallowing in the water  Naked  Yeah yeah  And just people 
[02:56:30]  You urinate on him  And he's washing it  Through his eyes  And now he's dead  Who knows  How could that happen  I'm sure  I'm sure he picked up something  But he was there  Every year  The trough junkie  He was like a famous guy  In Sydney  And you're pissed  Wow  In the conversation  How old was he  Yeah yeah  When I pissed  That's wild  When I pissed on him  I was about  I was about 20  When I first pissed on him  And he was  About 40 odd then  And I think he probably  Died at about 46  Or something like that  How do they allow that 
[02:57:00]  Like how was he  Was he not arrested  No it was the sleazeball ball  It was the whole ball  Where you could see  People sucking off  In the corners  Oh okay  Big day Marty  Then they had this  Big ball afterwards  And everyone wants  To go along to it  Including me  And we all go along  And we watch  You know  Fucking people getting  Sucked off  Wow  I say you get a wall  Drill a hole  And Big A  Well no  You'll have a girl  And a guy  And we'll see  If he'll know  Which is the difference  Yeah let's go with that  Would you allow that  Like how about  If the guy promised  Not to say anything  To fuck your vibe up 
[02:57:30]  Yeah  Like while he was  What if there was  A 50-50 chance  It was a girl  And it was zero  That's it  50-50 shot  50-50 shot  And we'd do it fairly  It'd be a toss of a coin  Whether you got  Sucked off  Oh that's a great idea  Yeah but we  Oh Jim  Jim would you do that  I would yeah  I would  Jim has you  A little bit with him  Don't you turn it back on me  I'm not frigid like you  Alright listen  We've got to take a break  Jim Jeffries is in the studio  Playing Carolines tonight  And tomorrow

[02:59:00]  Through me head  Was  If you die  Right now  This is how  They'll tell  Your mum  They found you  Now  As I've mentioned  I don't have  A big cock  Or nothing  I think the rubber  Cunt was faulty  But as I'm  Fucking it  The latex  On the top  Just sort of  Tears  And the egg  Falls out  The end  And I'm pretty  Upset  Because it's not  Like I can  Take it back  To the shop  Slap it  On the counter  And go  Look at that

[03:03:30]  Fashion  The  Other  One  I  Used  To  Widen  The  Hole  In  One  Motion  I  Snapped  This  Egg  Out  Of  My  Ass  Followed  By  Two  Feet  Of  Shit  It  Was  At  This  Moment  I  Thought  To  Myself  Should  Have  Done  That  In  The  Bathroom  Wednesday

[03:05:00]  We are back with Jim Jeffries.  Hey, do people like my stand-up comedy?  I couldn't listen to it.  Yeah, absolutely they did.  You don't like listening to it?  Yeah, I hear yourself.  You guys, I know you go home after this show  and you listen to the whole show back, don't you?  Every single word of it.  My favorite bit was when we called Voss a stupid prick. 
[03:05:30]  Before we forget.  I constantly go, I have to turn me off.  I do not want to listen to me.  Before we forget, we've got to go right back to that Anne Frank stuff.  That shit was really interesting.  I didn't know you were an expert.  No, it wasn't on the radio and it was good stuff.  Oh, right, right, that's good.  I didn't know you were an expert on Anne Frank, first of all.  I'm not an expert on Anne Frank.  I'll probably say some things here and there'll be some experts ringing up  going, well, that's not right.  But I went to the Anne Frank house.  It's not hard to find.  There's a big sign out the front.  I don't know what took the Nazis so long. 
[03:06:00]  The thing is, you always think she lived in this little tiny studio apartment  with like 10 of them all packed in there worrying about that.  It's a big fucking flat.  It's like two stories.  They've got a laundry.  They've got a place to wash stuff.  And they always go, the Nazis, they hid behind a bookcase  and there was a stairwell up the thing.  But it's so obviously a four-story building.  If you look at it from the outside, you go, well, there's two stories  and then there's another two stories. 
[03:06:30]  If you go in there and there's a shop and then there's the people  who used to run the shop live there.  I'm sure the Nazis could have asked some simple questions.  What has happened with the rest of the building?  Where would that be?  And why at the top of the staircase is there a bookcase  stopping the stairs from continuing?  This seems to be an odd thing.  It's four stories from the outside, two stories on the inside.  Two stories on the inside.  It was the opposite of the tires.  You'd think they would have fucking just taken the stairs down 
[03:07:00]  and like, you know, put the wall up if you're going to help the people.  And just cemented it in.  We've done something.  Well, they still had to give them food and stuff.  We'd have to give them a trap door or something.  A trap door.  A trap door.  Who are you?  Plus the money they made from the gift store.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A lot of people say that the space where they were living was cramped.  And that's not the truth.  It was cramped for two families.  It was like a four-bedroom and there was two families living in there.  I think of like four people in the family.  Four-bedroom, though.  Yeah, but they couldn't go out very much. 
[03:07:30]  No, I wouldn't think they could.  You know, there wasn't a lot of outings.  But they had a lot of nights out on the town.  I'll tell you what, though.  You look out the fucking Frank's window.  Beautiful view.  I'm telling you.  It's like onto a river and a nice bay of the Dutch people riding on bikes and chulips.  Chulips sure looks fucking like the occasional Nazi would go by and that would ruin the view for you.  But still.  A half-track.  It's much better than any apartment I've ever lived in.  I've saw the accountant being dragged down the street. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, it would wreck the view, but in general.  I am essential to the war effort.  Oh, yeah.  I was waving and laughing with a shovel.  I can't believe this.  You really can say anything on this radio show.  I can't believe in Britain you get done for anything.  And now we're talking about Jews and Frank and two girls shitting in a cup.  There's like a guy who can't speak in the corner that we pick on because he's fat.  This show's awesome. 
[03:08:30]  That's what it is about satellite radio, you know?  Big A, he was talking about you.  I know, I know.  Yeah.  He's like the guy out of Goonies that used to throw a baby roof at.  That's never heard of this.  Oh, man.  It's not described that way.  And then you were telling us, we were getting to know Jim Jeffries a little bit during the  break, and they were trying to get a Yo Mama show as you as the host.  They wanted me to host a show that was Yo Mama.  And Yo Mama is like, just the black guys saying, your mama's so fat, she does this. 
[03:09:00]  Your mama does that, she does this.  And they made me host a show, but they just got these middle class English kids that were  just going, well, I don't believe you dress well.  Maybe you should try bathing more.  And your mom, she's probably fat, I imagine.  I imagine.  And then at the end, sometimes someone would say something really nasty to another one and  go, I'm sorry about that.  That was a bit too much.  Oh, really?  What was it called?  It was called Danger Mouth. 
[03:09:30]  It never went past the pilot season.  Danger Mouth.  You know, there was a cartoon called Danger Mouse.  Did you get that over here?  Yeah.  That's the little thing.  And then when you said that during the break, Rich goes, well, there's no racism over...  There's no racism.  There's racism in Britain.  No, I didn't say Britain.  I said in Amsterdam, there's not as much black and white racism as there is here.  And that's how we got into Anne Frank.  And I go, then why do they have to clean the Anne Frank statue of swastikas once a month?  But I didn't say it.  I said, listen, you know what I'm saying?  Jews are hated everywhere.  I said, there's not a lot of black and white racism in Holland. 
[03:10:00]  No, because they unite in hating the Jews.  Right.  There's a lot of racism against Moroccans in Holland or Amsterdam.  How do you know?  Because I've been there about seven times.  Rich knows where racism is.  He can source racism out.  Rich learns the facts.  We'll do a quiz quickly.  Michael Richard, racist or not?  No.  Oh, right.  His name is Michael.  Michael Richard is good egg or not.  Andrew, are you feeling a little better?  Your hands are all tucked uncomfortably on your legs? 
[03:10:30]  Oh, I know.  You're sitting like a walrus.  Yeah.  You got so many flippers out on.  Every time you mention Anne Frank, he puts his hands between his legs.  Like, just say it.  It's a bizarre...  It's like a little...  No, he stopped now.  Anne Frank.  We got the scale.  You want to see if you're over 400 bills?  Yeah, let's take a little peek.  All right, we got the scale coming in.  It's not a standard scale.  It's like a crane.  It is really a heavy-duty scale.  Holy fuck.  What was the heaviest you weighed there, Big A, that you know of?  Oh, Big A, you had...  Holy shit, did you have trouble getting off that couch. 
[03:11:00]  It was like a couch getting off a couch.  Yeah, that's when you know you're on fit.  Big A.  When you have to rock off the couch.  Yeah, rocking.  But he doesn't...  He carries it well.  It's only a stomach.  I think that looks a mess.  How about those big fucking giant cloth shoes?  Hey, Big A, are you, like, shitting properly?  Remember we tried to get your duty pulled out of you?  That didn't work too well, huh?  We got the official to come in and read this.  What is it, Ther?  407. 
[03:11:30]  407.  So you said 390.  He admitted he was over 40.  All right, I...  Yeah.  I don't know what that is, but I know there was the episode of Simpsons where Homer had  to eat a lot to become 300 pounds to get onto welfare.  Yeah.  So I assume 400 pounds...  400...  Whatever the...  Pounds, are they?  Yeah, pounds.  I assume that's pretty big.  Yeah, that's...  That must be weird.  Is it popular show in England?  Wait.  What?  Simpsons are popular in England?  Simpsons are popular everywhere.  You don't have to do the...  You don't have to do the...  You don't have to do the...  That's my only Simpsons...  I can do Homer Simpson and Cliff Clavin because it's the same voice. 
[03:12:00]  So Homer Simpson, you go, oh, look, my sweet nourishing beer, beer with a nectar...  And then with Cliff Clavin, you speed it up and go, yeah, you know, the beer was invented  in 1842 by children.  I'm not an impersonator.  Please don't come to my show thinking I'm going to do an impersonator.  He does these impressions.  You think it was the real person.  You think it was the real people.  Yeah.  Do Lee Evans.  Do Lee Evans.  Lee Evans is...  I don't know.  I'm amazed that you can't just look at Big A and say he's fat.  You're, like, confused with the mad translation and stuff. 
[03:12:30]  I'm just thinking that he doesn't look like...  Like, he's morbidly obese.  Let's say it, right?  But he's still getting about.  There's stairs in this building.  He's still made it up.  I saw him stand up.  Well, this is an elevator.  He didn't do any stairs.  There's some women who fucking dig that, man.  The chubby chasers, man.  Yeah.  I think it's more guys into fat women than women into fat guys.  But I'm sure, you know, I'm sure there's a chick out there for you there, Big A.  He looks like he's about to do a stand-up routine.  One hole, two mouths. 
[03:13:00]  One hole, two mouths.  That's what we call the bit.  Fucking a hole in a wall with two mouths on the other end.  And fucking...  Yeah, yeah.  So a guy on a thing, two holes, two minutes.  Yeah, and he picks the hole.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, two holes.  Good idea.  Yeah, two holes and have a guy on one side and a thing.  So it's his choice.  And Big A gets his fucking prick sucked.  What do you think, Big A?  It's a 50-50 shot.  It's a 50-50 shot.  It's not bad odds for a blowjob.  The chick's going to be hot.  Yeah. 
[03:13:30]  Get your prick sucked.  You'd go into the Hall of Fame if you hit 500.  Yeah.  It's a 50-50 shot.  50-50, man.  Don't think of the negative aspect of what might happen.  Think of the positive aspect.  You could be getting sucked off by some...  Don't think...  Fucking nut.  Don't think half empty.  Either way, you're going to orgasm.  That's right.  So the bottom line is, either way, the finished result is you shooting a load, not on your stomach.  You know what I mean?  That fucking ball bag, it's going to look like a rung cloth. 
[03:14:00]  You're going to drop down to 398 pounds.  Yep.  That's seven pounds a ton.  I got it.  I got it.  I did the math there, Jim.  Nine pounds.  By the way, Big A, you weigh how many stones?  29.07 stones.  Jesus Christ!  You weigh a driveway wall.  Now he knows.  Jesus Christ!  He's 29 stone!  Now he's freaking out because he knows he's stoned. 
[03:14:30]  What the hell, man?  That's what I'm getting at.  Can't you just look at him in my eyes?  My mother's 24 stone and walks with a cane and is depressed all day.  Now he knows.  That's so funny because he finally can put it in perspective.  You might need your eyes checked, Jim Jefferies.  No, he's fucking massive.  29 stone!  You should be dead like seven times.  Sorry, man.  He looks sad when I said that.  Yeah, he'll just look like that every so often.  That is an odd thing, though, because it's like someone saying, how much does he weigh? 
[03:15:00]  Oh, he weighs $400 to us.  And we'd be like, what the fuck does that mean?  It's like $400.  I can't understand how much that weighs.  But to him, when we say, you know, 400 pounds, it's like it's a fucking unit of measurement  for money, not weight.  What's he weigh Tuesday?  And then when you find out, it's like, what does he weigh Tuesday?  He weighs Tuesday.  Don't you understand how big that is, you idiot?  Oh, fuck, that's pretty funny. 
[03:15:30]  It's also 185 kilos there.  Yeah, that's a lot.  That's a lot, right?  That's not in the healthy arc.  No.  That's not in the bit where the doctors say, yeah, you're a bit overweight.  You could do with losing some weight, a little weight.  That's the type of weight that even if he lost it, he'd have gross skin hanging off him.  Yeah.  Yeah, you'd be like a bat.  So you might as well just say, good morning, Missouri. 
[03:16:00]  Missouri?  Why were you on good morning, Missouri?  I was playing Cairns.  They put me on good morning, Missouri, and I said the word slutty, so they kicked me off  TV.  Slutty?  I didn't think it was that bad a word.  All I said was, they said, how was your Halloween?  I've never celebrated Halloween before.  And I said, I thought I was going to see a lot of people in scary outfits and get scared.  I didn't see any of that.  I just saw a whole lot of chicks wearing slutty outfits.  I got aroused.  Right?  Those cunts.  Those cunts, yeah.  They threw me out for slutty. 
[03:16:30]  And then I called the host a slutty bitch, and then they know, I just got...  Yeah, slutty probably doesn't play well in Missouri.  Not really.  I would think like, you'd probably get away with it here, maybe LA.  Yeah, definitely LA.  Topeka, Kansas.  Topeka.  I don't think they'd like that.  Yeah, the Midwest people.  Midwest kind of like...  We think of England, or even Australia, like it's England and Australia.  But then the United States, you know, you got the Northeast, the Midwest, and they're all 
[03:17:00]  different types of people.  You've got some...  Britain has the greatest scum in the world.  Really?  The dividing class is fucking out.  There's British people who think you're fancy if you got your original teeth.  Like, I'm serious.  Like, proper, proper scum in England.  Really?  You just gotta go to the sport.  You watch like football matches.  You can't...  You have to sit in...  Like in soccer matches, you can't have home and away fans sitting next to each other, 
[03:17:30]  because they'll just kill each other.  Yeah.  Right?  And there's cops all in between.  It's not...  It's a violent, fucking racist, scum-filled...  I dig it, man.  Thank God you guys don't have guns, man.  Oh, no.  Well, the cops don't even have guns, which I always find weird, is cops don't have guns.  Yeah.  Because I'm bigger than some of them, and I'm wearing sneakers.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  So, like, I just run away.  You know, what are they gonna do?  Stop it.  That's not good.  Blow that whistle.  They have tasers and stuff like that.  Why no guns, though? 
[03:18:00]  I don't get that.  Because...  I don't hear that.  What?  No cops for the citizens, or none for the...  For the cops, at least?  I don't know.  It's probably a high suicide rate.  The cops will probably top themselves or something.  I don't know.  I don't know what the exact...  Probably they're afraid of getting, like, some of them stolen.  Like, the second even the cops have guns, then they get, like, misplaced or ripped off,  and now a few of the bad guys got more guns.  Do a lot of criminals have guns over there?  Of course.  Yeah, of course.  Oh, the criminals have them.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, see, my oldest brother, he's head of the riot squad for the New South Wales Police 
[03:18:30]  in Sydney, right?  So, and he reckons...  Well, during the opening of the 2000 Olympics, he was laying on top of the stadium as a sniper  waiting for a Monica Sellers moment to happen.  Oh, yeah.  Like, just sort of staring through.  And he reckons he had the Australian Prime Minister in his sight.  Wow.  And he was just doing that thing in his head where he was going, alive, dead, alive.  Oh, shit.  That's what you do when you're just sitting there going, this is how much power of this 
[03:19:00]  little trigger, and I could change the world and be all fucking...  Well, he's just killing an Australian Prime Minister.  What's his name?  Does anyone know?  No one even cares.  No one even knows.  It's actually Shakespeare.  No one cares.  No, it's Arthur...  Treacher.  No, no, no.  Arthur begins with a B.  John Howard.  Bertrand.  Arthur Bertrand or Bertrand?  John Howard.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Here's something.  Here's something.  Who's Arthur Bertrand?  Did you make that up?  Of course I did.  Is that someone in charge of something?  No. 
[03:19:30]  He's a cunt to whoever he is.  Here's a big problem I have with Europe in any way, shape, or form.  This sounds cool.  Right.  And then there's this.  I cannot take the European siren on police vehicles or emergency vehicles.  Why not?  That's only an ambulance one.  The police have a different one. 
[03:20:00]  The firemen have a different one.  Yeah, but isn't it all like that?  No, no, no.  You get this one?  That's like...  That's like fucking...  No, the fire ones.  That's get the fuck out of my way.  Yeah, that's the firemen in Britain.  That's the firemen in Britain.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  And they get there and go, all right then.  Yeah, they go, all right, little tiny flower.  We don't have hoses.  The cops don't have guns and we don't have hoses.  I'll give the firemen hoses.  We have just...  All right, Bucket Brigade, bring your own water.  All right, we call them the Bucket Brigade. 
[03:20:30]  That's what I loved about the L.A. fires and what wasn't there to love.  I enjoy the fact that the reason that L.A. was burning down is because of all the imported  gum trees from Australia.  You dumb fucks, right?  Like, they were burning in Australia for hundreds of years and then someone went, oh, they look  nice.  We'll put them over in California.  They're full of eucalyptus oil.  They will burn all day.  Oh, yeah.  That's the reason.  Wow.  That's the reason it keeps going.  Australia has the worst bushfires in the world and now California because you don't even 
[03:21:00]  have koala bears.  What do you need the tree for?  What do you need the eucalyptus for?  Yeah.  What do you need the eucalyptus for?  We'll sell you the oil if you want to put it on your bloody chest when you've got a  thing.  We'll sell it to you.  You don't need the homegrown stuff.  So much wasted space down there in Australia.  What a wasted fucking land.  Yeah, but there's not enough water.  We've got water shortages.  Yeah, but there's ways to pump it in and, you know.  Look at what the U.S. of A. did.  We find rivers or this or that or desalination plants and you'll pump it in. 
[03:21:30]  Have you been to the middle of Australia?  Never.  It's not wasted.  No one would ever live there.  No one would live there.  It's just red dirt.  It's just the most horrible crap you have ever seen.  There's nothing.  There's nothing.  There's one town in the very center called Cooper Pedy, right?  Cooper Pedy.  It's so fucking hot and red and shit, right?  They all live underground.  There's no type of thing.  There's just holes in the ground.  Does that get the fuck out of me?  I'm not kidding.  Oh, that's fantastic.  You look up Cooper Pedy on the internet and it's just a town where they all live 
[03:22:00]  underground video stores and it's just...  Are you shitting me?  Because it's cooler down there.  There's no heat.  So it's not primitive underground.  It's like Fraggle Rock.  It's that fucking hell.  It's Fraggle Rock.  Cooper Pedy.  I guess there's even a scene where they go to it and Priscilla Queen in the Desert  where they all...  Where's she going?  Wow.  How do they keep water from flooding them?  It doesn't rain out there ever.  It never rains.  How do they get water?  They would love a flood. 
[03:22:30]  That would be a great day.  They would be so chuffed with that.  See little Amy?  She died during the floods but I'm not thirsty anymore.  Just red clay running down your hole?  Oh yeah.  It's just red crap.  I'm sure there is some type of ventilation.  I've only driven past and had a quick look in on a desolate day.  I did it once and I don't have any need to go there again.  It just always struck me as anytime I watch a show about the Outback and people are out 
[03:23:00]  there in their vehicles and it just looks like if anything happens, you are so completely  fucked.  Did you see that Wolf Creek movie?  No.  Wolf Creek.  That's a scary fucking film.  Just about a serial killer who someone...  Because all these people die.  All these British backpackers go, their car breaks down and they're never found again.  Never.  Not the car.  Nothing is ever found again.  Because there's heaps of serial killers out in the middle.  They just hang out.  In the middle.  In the middle.  It's like a fucking video game. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  There's heaps of serial killers.  There was this one guy which is Ivan Milat and they caught him for like fucking 10 people.  They're giving him 10 life sentences.  They can't put him in prison for any longer.  And his last thing as he left the court is he went, I'll never find all of them.  Right?  I'll never find them all.  And then occasionally they find another one and he goes, oh you got me.  That's me as well.  That was another one of mine.  Did you find a boyfriend?  Oh, she didn't have a boyfriend.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Wait, how long did he kill for? 
[03:24:00]  What's that?  How long did he kill for?  How long did they kill for?  No, how long did he kill for?  Oh, it could have been anywhere between 10 and 20 years.  Oh, wow.  Fuck.  He's really, he was, see that Wolf Creek, man, that's fucking, because that's based on a  true story.  It's based on a true story of these British people that just went missing, man.  That's something.  And they, and they, there's petrol stations in Australia where if you don't stop at that  petrol station, if they, if they see you drive past, they go, well, he's dead. 
[03:24:30]  You have to stop.  That's the one you have to stop at.  No matter if it's even just to top it off a little bit, you've got to stop.  You've got to stop there because there's not one for another thousand miles or some fucker  like that, right?  And it's like, it's like people drive faster going, well, that petrol's a bit pricey.  He's fucking right.  He's dead.  Yeah.  Wow.  I suggest you just pay what they ask.  Yeah.  Let's go to Nashville.  Neil, what's up?  That's great.  We're hanging with Jim Jeffries.  Yeah.  I was just going to mention the town he's talking about, Cooper, Pia, at the middle of Australia  is where they filmed a lot of scenes for Star Wars and stuff. 
[03:25:00]  And that's where they have a lot of replica ships that they were just so big, they didn't  move them.  They just left them out in the middle of the desert where you can go visit them and stuff.  It's so far out in the middle of nowhere.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  How about that?  That's all I got.  A little knowledge.  Speaking of Star Wars, I'll tell you a little story.  I don't know if this is funny or not.  My other brother, not the cop, my other brother was the property manager of Fox Studios when  George Lucas came to do Attack of the Clones, right?  Because they did that in Sydney, right?  Mm-hmm.  And so my brother is sitting there, he's such a fucking dick, right? 
[03:25:30]  And he's sitting there with George Lucas and he goes, and George Lucas is about to sign  the contract and he goes, can I be a stormtrooper?  And George Lucas goes, well, all the stormtroopers in this film are going to be CGI, so I'm sorry,  you can't be a stormtrooper.  And then he goes, oh, is there like a bar scene like in the first film?  Could I be like a bounty hunter or something like that?  And then George goes, look, the entire film's already cast.  And my brother goes, for fuck's sake, George, I'm giving you a good deal, right?  If you watch Attack of the Clones, right, when Obi-Wan Kenobi chases the bounty hunter into 
[03:26:00]  the bar, there is a lizard at that bar, my brother, right?  And his eyes follow the camera, like he just sort of gives it a...  I know that's not good for you, but that is a true story.  I'll have to see that now.  I'll have to watch that part.  Oh, brother, what a tool.  What was he giving the eyes like Pee-Wee did in Pee-Wee's Big Adventure?  He's got the movie part.  Paging Mr. Herman. 
[03:26:30]  Looking into the camera.  He's been a few...  He was in...  He's an extra in The Matrix, and he's an extra in Moulin Rouge.  Really?  Well, he just...  He had all this power at the studio, and he was meant to be the guy in charge, and instead  he's just a fucking...  He's like storing pipes out of these people.  He's just a fucking...  I was an extra in Moulin Rouge in the fucking...  The bit where the Cole Kidman swing or anything, but you can't see me, but I was in a top hat  waving money, but I never get on film.  But I spent a day watching her on a trapeze thing going, no matter how they paint their  chicks, he's never quite hot.  I'm sick and tired of people telling us what hot chicks are on movies. 
[03:27:00]  They're going, oh, Nicole Kidman's a sex symbol.  Is she?  Who fucking decided this?  Is that weird-looking, pasty-skinned ginger bird a sex...  Have you seen that movie, My Girlfriend's a Superhero, or something, that I've been right  as a piece of shit?  My ex-super...  Yeah.  Stop telling me Uma Thurman's good-looking.  She's fucking not.  Her eyes are too far apart.  She's got this weird fucking head. 
[03:27:30]  She's about 45 now.  And she's in these films, and people are going, oh, she's the best-looking woman I've ever  seen.  You can't fucking polish a turd and tell me it's chocolate.  You know, you're exactly right, because who the fuck do they say every year has the best  smile?  Who?  Julia Roberts.  Julia Roberts.  Oh, she's got the greatest smile, and you see her smile now, and it's just like she's  getting this picket fence thing going with her teeth, and her lips are ridiculous.  They're not attractive at all. 
[03:28:00]  No.  But people tell you, some magazine tells you that that's how it is, and you're supposed  to go, oh, okay.  She doesn't have a nice smile.  She's cute.  But the sexiest women, the hundred sexiest women, and someone like Hillary Clinton will  make it on there, because she's a strong, powerful woman, and that's sexy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Shut the fuck up, and show some ass.  Do you guys get Charlotte Church over here?  You get Charlotte Church?  Oh, yeah.  I've seen her, yeah.  She was the little kid of the thing.  Yeah.  She's, like, massively famous over there.  She's massively famous.  She has her own Tonight Show over here. 
[03:28:30]  They keep on telling her she's one of the top ten.  She's just this fat little piece of shit.  She's a mouthy fucking cunt.  I wouldn't fuck her again, man.  Yeah.  Let's go to Marilyn.  Ah.  What's up, Marilyn?  Hey, guys.  I wanted to make a comment about Jim Jeffries saying about the movie Wolf Creek.  Yeah.  It's a really good movie, actually.  I saw it.  It's one of my favorites. 
[03:29:00]  And I'm not going to give away the whole movie.  Well, don't.  There's two girls and one guy.  He kills the two girls, and the guy gets away.  I'll give it away for you.  No, well, the girls wake up, and they're more concerned about trying to find everybody else  in their group.  And the funniest part about it is the guy wakes up, doesn't even look, and just, he's  like, fuck this, I'm out of here.  Yeah.  Did you see those birds?  They were English.  He didn't want them.  He was just trying to, you know.  If you're going to save your own life, if they've already been serial killed, I think one of 
[03:29:30]  the girls was already dead by that scene in the film.  They cut her spine out, so that then he rapes her, but she's got no sensation.  She's just a head.  Like, she's now, like, a quadriplegic, and so she's awake during the whole thing.  It's a great film.  Wow.  Documentary?  You fucked up.  Hey, let's say hi to John in Jersey.  John.  Hey, Jim Jeffries.  Love to come.  You got to have a question for you.  You ever try to suck your own dick or succeed in sucking your own dick?  I've tried when I was younger, but I've grown up since then and realized that I'm not an 
[03:30:00]  athletic man, or am I flexible?  If you couldn't do it as a kid, you ain't going to do it as an adult.  You're at your most flexible as a kid.  I can't touch my toes.  And that seems to be mandatory if you're going to suck your dick.  When do you have to retire from that sport?  Like, 13 years old?  Not probably.  When does your body change where you just can't throw the curb?  I would think 16, you got to try to stop sucking your own dick.  I thought it was your best night.  Because at that point, by 16, you still might be nimble, but you'll have that strength to 
[03:30:30]  maybe, you know, pull yourself over.  You'll have better abs.  Does anybody know anybody that's ever done it?  Seen it in movies.  Yeah, Ron Jeremy does it.  Yeah, Ron Jeremy's done it.  And he doesn't bend that far.  Seen it in movies.  He just sort of ducks his head down a little bit.  Yeah, he makes himself cum and fucking, yeah.  That's fucked up right there.  He's a good guy, anyway.  Is he gay?  Do you shoot in your mouth or what?  What do you do?  Is that gay?  I don't think it is gay.  It isn't.  If you're sucking your own dick, is he gay?  No way.  If you're shooting your mouth.  No.  It's your own cock.  It's fantastic.  It's your own cock.  You touch your own dick. 
[03:31:00]  It's like saying you're wanking.  Does that make you gay?  Ah, you know what I'm saying?  If you're wanking other guys, that does make you gay.  Brings up a good point.  Jerking off is jerking off.  If you're thinking of another guy while you're sucking your dick, then you're gay.  If you shoot polish it black before you suck it, you're a fag.  If you videotype it and watch it back, you're gay.  If you lie and then cum in your own mouth, you're a fag.  If you do it for money. 
[03:31:30]  If you have a friend suck your balls at the same time.  That's right.  By the way, the people out there didn't forget about Big A.  You know, we're trying to get this thing done where you get your dick sucked through  like a fucking wall.  Same uncomfortable hand motion, by the way.  So you say it was little hands pointed out?  Yeah.  There'll be a guy and a girl on the other side of the wall.  You stick your dick in the hole and either the girl or the guy sucks you.  50-50 shot.  50-50 shot.  And we won't tell.  We'll just flip the coin and then just tell the person.  No, no, no.  We give him the choice of a hole.  Yeah.  He has complete control. 
[03:32:00]  I like that.  Yeah, so he can just.  So you have complete control.  It's like in Flash Gordon when he puts his hand into that hole thing and he could.  It's an old film.  And we'll let you plug any buffet.  Right.  Well, there's a long way to read a couple of instant feedbacks, but someone from their  cell phone writes, we saw his cock.  How thin is this wall?  Oh.  Oh.  Tissue paper.  Well, funny you should say that.  Mark C. from Jersey.  His fucking baby dick wouldn't reach through a piece of paper.  Forget a wall.  What's wrong with Andrew's dick? 
[03:32:30]  Your dick is fine.  I think the wall needs a shelf coming out with something for him to rest his gut on top  of.  Yeah, yeah.  So he can get as much leverage in there as possible.  As much dick.  So maybe if we have them in cardboard boxes so he can stand above or something.  Or, you know.  Andrew's, how big is your penis?  Average.  Average penis.  Biggest average.  What size?  What size?  Don't say you don't know.  What size of rect is it?  What measurement? 
[03:33:00]  In stones.  Yeah.  It's a Wednesday cock.  It's Wednesday.  What is it?  My cock is three pebbles.  I guess about five inches, I guess.  Now remember, relative to you, you know, the Earth is big, but when you put it next to  Jupiter, eh, that's the big.  First of all, five is not average, I don't think.  Six and a half is average.  Second of all, get the hell out of here.  Five is average.  Six and a half is average. 
[03:33:30]  Five is average.  Six and a half is average in your country, maybe.  What, centimeters?  Yeah, we're very big down.  Where's Chuck of the Day?  Thank you very much.  Good luck.  And second, everyone lies about their dick size, and now we're talking your...  You're tacking some on.  You're closer to like four and a half.  I'm six inches in just a little bit, and it's quite wide, I've been told, but they're  never going to tell you different, are they, women, because they're liars.  If they're related to you, they'll tell you the truth.  Really?  Is that why you had daughters?  Big A, the five, the six in. 
[03:34:00]  Big A, you need money?  Big A, I was told, big girth.  Big girth?  Yeah.  Big A, you need money?  Oh, his eyes lit up.  He's smiling like Julia Roberts.  He's big girth.  You're going to need a wide hole.  Yeah.  If we measure...  That was just some girl telling you you were big earth.  No?  Okay.  New bit.  New bit.  New bit, because he's not terrible.  He's not going to do the cocksucking bit. 
[03:34:30]  Sure he will.  Why not?  Why not?  All right.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  Maybe we can change the odds a little bit.  All right.  Two girls, one guy.  How about three holes?  Yeah, two girls.  Two girls, one guy.  Now you have a 33 and a third percent chance of getting fucked over.  You have 66 percent chance.  66.  66.  66.  66.  66.  66.  66.  66.  66.  66.  66.  66.  66.  66.  66.  66.  66.  66.  66.  66.  66.  66.  66.  66.  66.  66.  That's the devil's number, my friend.  Yeah.  What do you think?  How much we want to measure your penis?  How much we want to measure your penis? 
[03:35:00]  That's what we're getting at.  Okay, you guys hold him up and I'll get the skulls.  The bit is simple.  You say you have a five inch dick.  I will give you a thousand dollars if it measures to five.  Well, you really want to get rid of this thousand bucks.  I know.  He's got to get a hard on.  No, but let's say.  We're not measuring it.  We'll get a chick.  We'll do it.  No, I think that's fair.  I'll tell you what.  I will do this cock sucking in the hole if it's three to one.  If it's three to one, that's good stats, but I've got to be hot cheeks and I've got  to see who I got done by afterwards.  Three to one. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, and a hot guy.  He's got to look like fucking Ricky Martin.  He's going to be sucking white dick.  Really?  You don't like some fucking...  In fact, what's Ricky Martin doing these days?  We haven't seen him for a while.  Where is he?  He's sucking dick behind a fucking board.  Ricky Martin has to be the guy.  Would you...  Now, you say you want to see the chick that did it when you're done.  Would you want to know?  I'd want to know.  You stick your dick in the hole.  There's three holes.  Two girls, one guy.  You get a blowjob.  You come.  It feels great.  You think it's fantastic.  You want to know.  I want to know.  What if it was the guy? 
[03:36:00]  And you're like, that was a great blowjob.  You can get his number.  I'm running short of material at the moment.  This is right up my alley.  You're going to be in town for a while.  Don't make us go with us.  I'm back on tour in this country in March.  You have a lot of time to plan this.  I will be back.  It's not that hard to drill a hole.  But I tell you what, I want a contract.  Because if I get behind this, three guys behind that wall or something, I'm fucking suing.  Right, right.  I've never seen him alive.  We couldn't possibly have that.  You have to be fair.  They'd have to be two real fucking smoking hot. 
[03:36:30]  And he can't be the guy.  No.  I will know if there's a stutter on the end of my dick.  Hold on, Big A.  We want to measure your penis.  It can be soft.  It doesn't matter.  Who's going to measure his penis?  There's a girl out there.  Will she measure it?  Soft is not going to get the job done.  That's going to be way less than five.  Oh, yeah.  We're just curious, soft.  If I want to measure.  Do you really reckon it's a show goes up?  Come on, let's do it.  Get him hard.  Here, Big A, how about you just pull your underpants out, and then Jimmy can take a peek. 
[03:37:00]  I don't want to take a peek.  Just give us a look at it.  Do you want to get him hard?  Put a roast beef on the table.  Have you seen it before?  No.  I think we sorted it.  Nah, see, he got a handy through his underwear.  Like, through his underwear leg.  Did he come?  No, there were issues that day.  Do you mind if I retell the story?  Big A doesn't like this, but...  No, he hates the story.  We had two prostitutes.  Wait, Andrew, what's the matter?  Ladies in the evening from...  Were they nice? 
[03:37:30]  Yeah, turn off the spotlight.  If you're in the shadows, maybe...  He hates the story.  Why did he hate the story?  Andrew...  Two girls from the Bunny Ranch came in.  Yes.  And we got them to, you know, mess around with Big A.  One girl tried to jerk him off, but he never got hard, never came.  And then something happened because one of the girls ran out of the studio crying.  We actually got a prostitute to run out of the studio crying.  What did you do to her, man?  What did you do to her?  It was just a bad day for Big A, right, Big A?  He was nervous.  There might have been some black stuff on her hand, and it might have smelled really bad 
[03:38:00]  that it got her crying.  The underpants...  What did he put on her hand?  The black stuff from the underpants.  Black stuff.  Like, you have to take socks off, and you got your fucking little bit of little sock stuff  stuck to your nose.  Like a bit of lint?  Wait, it was lint?  See, this girl sucks cock for a living, and she was worried about a bit of lint?  It must have been worse than that.  No.  All these months, I thought it was rotting skin, but it was just lint?  Well, put it this way.  It was probably lint that had been in a cadaver's asshole.  I reckon his cock fucking loses its skin like a snake. 
[03:38:30]  It's a tarantula cock.  It just shed.  It just shed.  They find it just the skin laying there.  Yeah, you just go, oh, it must be summer.  He was a little nervous.  He couldn't...  I mean, it's hard to perform sexually in front of people.  Yeah, you're all right with that, right?  It's so long ago.  I worked very briefly in the porn industry.  Very, very briefly.  Love that.  No, as a presenter on the Adult Channel in Britain, when I first started doing comedy,  they used to have the porn stars doing the presenting in between the things, right?  And so I got this job doing the next on the Adult Channel, we have four things and 
[03:39:00]  whatever, right?  And I went on the set of one porn once where they had celebrity lookalikes fucking, right?  And it was Britney Spears and Eminem, right?  And they couldn't get a guy to look like Eminem, so they just put him in a regular hockey mask  and dungarees and gave him a chainsaw, right?  Between shoots, between shoots, they're trying to keep...  This guy's trying to keep hard, like, while they're changing the set, right?  I'm standing up in the corner, he's wanking off, he's still got the hockey mask on, he's 
[03:39:30]  wanking to stay hard, and he looks over at me and he goes, hey, Jim, how'd you get into  comedy, mate?  And I went, you know, I did some open spots in bars around Sydney, you know, this way.  He's still wanking and he looks at me and he goes, I don't know how you'd do that, mate,  that's got to be the hardest job in the world.  But he never stopped wanking, not for a fucking moment.  Like, don't fucking talk to me.  Small talk.  Jack it off.  Try and stay hard.  Did Britney look like Britney?  Yeah, she looked all right.  It was a girl called Katrina Clark, if you look her up on the internet. 
[03:40:00]  She was the porn.  But it's British porn.  Because I remember, I was getting paid 700 pounds for the day for all the links, right?  And I had a little hissy fit, because they had me there from 6 in the morning till 6 at  night, and I had a little temper tantrum and just went, oh, for fuck's sake, I'm a professional  fucking comedian.  I don't need to be here all day.  They said it would take three hours, 700 fucking quid, 700 pounds, they could all go get fucked.  And then the girl who took it up the ass looks at me and goes, I only got 300.  And I felt really bad. 
[03:40:30]  And then I thought, fuck it, I got 700 quid in my pocket.  I might buy the bitch for the weekend.  It's British porn.  I don't think I'm endearing myself to all of America right now.  No, this is great.  It's awesome.  Our listeners love you.  Is British porn that much different than American porn?  Well, the thing is, I like American porn, because at least with the accent, I can assume that  they're classy, sort of, hey, you know, fuck me up the ass, that's really good, you know?  Like, oh, it's sexy for me.  But then the British porn, I know exactly where that slap is from.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Their accents are so real. 
[03:41:00]  It's like, all right, do me up a fucking shit.  And that's fucking great, that is.  That's fucking awesome.  Right?  And you just go, that's not sexy.  I think that girl might be from Liverpool.  Plus, they're not cut, are they?  Over there.  What?  I'm circumcised.  All Australians are circumcised during the 70s because of, you know, sand and heat and  stuff, right?  Yeah, the red dirt.  Yeah, no, they've got that sweaty hood on the top of them.  That's fucking...  I'll tell you what, British chicks, man, when they see a circumcised cock, it's a novelty 
[03:41:30]  for them.  They look at it.  They, you know, they like it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So, Big A, we'll put a British girl on the other side of the wall.  Are you clipped, Big A?  Oh, yes.  Oh, really?  I've got to think about it.  You really enjoyed that gum.  He would have been really heavy if he kept it.  Yeah, right?  Big, fat foreskin.  Yeah, if he had that big, fat, five-pound foreskin hanging up the top like a green big calamari  ring that you could fit around your head. 
[03:42:00]  Wow.  Looks like...  Oh, no, we're going to eat calamari.  It's like giant squid melting, pulled out of the fucking ocean.  You do the prostitutes, Jim?  What's that?  You do the prostitutes?  Do I do prostitutes?  I have done, but I don't do any on a regular basis.  No?  No.  Well, it's illegal in this country.  Well, that's what they say.  I have done in Amsterdam because, you know, I'm a tourist.  When you work in the clubs in the States here, are girls hitting on you after the show? 
[03:42:30]  Well, I've had a bit of sex since I've come to this club.  You've had a bit of sex?  Yeah.  I've had a little go.  In New York or on the road?  Not in New York yet.  It's hard.  I'm doing the Leary gig.  I went straight out with my management agents and stuff like that.  And so I didn't get to see anyone after the gig.  I thought I could have gotten like Dan and then.  But see, the weird thing about Dennis Leary is, right, did you notice, right, that he  used to be, when I was young, he was like this hip sort of like dangerous comic.  Now, because of Rescue Me, he seems to be like a 40-year-old fat woman sex symbol. 
[03:43:00]  Because he's like 50 years old.  It's just like, like when we left, there was all those women waiting at the stage door  with photos just like, I love you, Dennis.  I love you.  And it's just this fat fucking piece of shit that looks like him in a wig, right?  It's just getting things.  No, you're not a piece of, you're a good guy.  Wait till you do an O&A show.  Yeah, at least they were women.  Dennis Leary was saying from the stage that he's looking more and more like an aged lesbian. 
[03:43:30]  An aging lesbian.  I think he's a good looking comic.  But he said that.  He's cut.  He's got good looking hair, man.  He's talented, man.  I mean, by the way, on the woman thing, first of all, I haven't been laid in New York.  If any woman wants to lay me in New York, they'll put a picture of me up on the website  or just go to my MySpace page and come along to the show this evening.  Don't do the picture.  Let them hear your comedy because that's, you know.  Jeez, that's a nice backhanded compliment.  Yeah, but they have listened to me for like two hours already today.  Girls like humor, but then when they put your face to it. 
[03:44:00]  I'm just saying he's ugly.  No, no, I'm just saying.  What more do you have to do?  Because he's just like humor.  I'm complimenting him.  Humor.  Dave from Tennessee.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey, Dave.  Rich, why was the first question you asked about British porn that the guys are unclipped?  Because it's so gross.  If you're going to watch porn.  Because Rich is a fucking Peter Pumper.  Because Rich likes looking at a nice cock in porn.  And you sat and stared at the old men's cock for 15 minutes.  No, I was staring at the whole situation. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah, and the whole situation.  And pondering that situation.  All based around the one cock.  No, no, no, no, no.  For me, it did.  Rich, it's okay.  My private porn stuff.  You suck cock for a little extra drugs.  Extra drugs.  That's all right.  Back in the day, you dressed up for your drug dealer because he knew he liked you.  And you're trying to cut off jean shorts.  Let's not go down that road again.  Here's what I'm saying.  If you're going to look at porn.  Yeah, because it's getting old, right?  If you're going to look at porn, everybody agrees.  You want to see a nice cock?  You want to see everything the whole show wants to be.  You want to see the helmet. 
[03:45:00]  You don't like to not be able to see the cock helmet.  Yeah, I've got to see cock in porn.  I'm not interested.  Just straight lesbian porn, I'm not interested.  Yeah, it's boring.  I've got to see cock.  You're right.  Yeah, Rocco Cefetti's the best porn star in the world, man.  Yeah, he is.  I agree.  When I go to porn, Nacho.  Nacho's good, too.  He's the best.  When you watch Rocco Cefetti, there's a little bit of your brain that goes,  she might die.  When you look at porn on the internet, you go to girls sucking guys' dicks.  That's more exciting than two girls getting down, don't you think?  Yeah, I like to see a girl say, I like to see one girl and several cocks in a thing. 
[03:45:30]  I like to see her being destroyed.  Really?  Yeah, that's my thing.  Being destroyed.  I'll tell you what, I've had threesomes and stuff.  I once had a threesome with three girls.  That was definitely one girl.  That's for foursome, right?  There was three girls there.  It was one girl, two men.  It was like fucking spinning plates trying to keep everyone happy.  And one of them, he was sort of involved in the deal that the fat friend came along,  and I was like fucking humping the fat one and just staring at the good-looking one in  the corner.  It was one of the most disturbing moments of my entire life. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah, what the fuck is she doing here?  Yeah, but you have to.  You can't just go, no.  That's a trooper, man.  You pull out and cum on the fat one.  Yeah, angrily.  Yeah, I was taking a lot of coke back then.  I haven't for a while since I've been in this country.  Yes, it's illegal here.  Is it?  It is everywhere I hear.  When do you go back?  When do you go back?  I go back on Monday. 
[03:46:30]  I get on the plane.  And then, yeah, so I haven't been taking any drugs in this country.  Do you like perform all over the world or just?  Yeah, yeah, I do, you know, I mostly do Britain and Europe, but I do like, I've done like  South Africa, and I've done a lot of gigs out in Hong Kong and Tokyo, and most of that's  for like businesses, company type of things, but I've done those a few times.  Did you go to the sex clubs?  We were just learning about the sex clubs.  In Bangkok, I wouldn't fuck a hooker in Bangkok.  It's just too dodgy. 
[03:47:00]  Like, you will catch something, but everything's a sex club there, right?  I was going into sex club, to sex club, to sex club, and eventually I was just like,  over it, I was saying to the guy who was showing me around, I was just like, I just don't  want to go to a sex club anymore, man, just a normal bar, that's all I want, just a normal  bar, right?  I go into this normal bar, and I'm like, thank fuck for that, man, like, I was sick of this,  and then he taps me on the shoulder, he goes, look up, and I look up, it's a glass ceiling,  and it's all these girls in schoolgirl outfits sitting with no underwear, just on the thing.  And that was the least sex bar he could take me to, with numbers written on their asses 
[03:47:30]  so you could choose which one.  In Africa, when you were in Africa, like...  South Africa.  Where, Sun City, or...  No, I did Cape Town in...  Sun City?  Jesus Christ.  I ain't got to play Sun City.  Are you out of your fucking mind?  Isn't that South Africa?  How old is he?  Isn't that South Africa?  Isn't that a...  Yeah, but South Africa.  There is no fucking Sun City.  Oh.  There's no big fucking Sun City anymore like that.  There was...  Oh, it's kind of a crack in place, man. 
[03:48:00]  I'm a fucking history buff.  I don't keep on my...  I'm just asking him questions about the fucking poverty.  You're fucking...  Yeah, but you're way off.  Hey, did you play Mesopotamia?  Fucking...  Did you play Mesopotamia?  Make sure you get your contract on papyrus.  That's right.  I'm doing a tour of Persia.  It's all in stone.  You couldn't fucking grow in Africa.  No, I...  There's no way.  I used to have my girlfriend when I was in Africa.  I cheated on her with this bird and fucking... 
[03:48:30]  The condom busted and I was so worried.  But the cool thing about South Africa,  one of the nicer things is...  They'll do you an AIDS test in like 10 minutes, right?  And because one in four people there have AIDS...  You don't want to know that question.  Why are you waiting there?  Why are you waiting there for your AIDS test?  I'll bring someone with AIDS to come down and sit with you and go,  it's not that bad.  That's what they do.  Just as it comes through, they go,  look at me.  I'm all right.  Not bad.  You heard of Magic Johnson?  He's all right.  When's Magic Johnson going to start looking like he's got AIDS? 
[03:49:00]  Never.  How long is that going to take?  Never.  I'm staying...  He looks so healthy.  I'm staying to think I want AIDS.  We send them rubbers to South Africa to help the AIDS  and they take them and staple them on paper and pass them out.  Yeah, it's just a joke though.  We're just having a bit of a laugh.  There's just no knowledge.  I'd be a fucking king there.  I tell you what,  there is a bad thing in South Africa  with some of the less educated areas  where they think if you fuck a virgin,  that takes the AIDS away from you. 
[03:49:30]  So there's a big rape thing with young girls and everything.  I'm not going to joke about that  because that's pretty fucking real.  Well, they're an advanced culture.  They're very good people.  Have you ever performed at brokerage in Long Island?  Because I'll be there this weekend.  I've never been to Long Island.  Nice segue.  Jesus, dude.  What are you doing?  You.  Nice segue.  Your mom.  That's what she said.  All right, we're going to do line of the day and get out of here.  I have to tinkle.  What's line of the day?  Is that some famous person who said something? 
[03:50:00]  Oh, see, we are very competitive on this program.  Am I up for an award?  You could be.  Very well be.  So every day,  the little quips,  little lines that we've all thrown out willy-nilly during the day  are reviewed by our crack staff.  And there are a couple of runner-ups for today  and one winner,  which is dubbed line of the day,  which, according to our crew,  is the funniest, knee-slapping, hearty-har-har thing 
[03:50:30]  that was said all day.  All right.  A very competitive program.  I just want to say something really funny now.  I could still win.  You can't get it under the wire.  Sometimes some people say something funny.  And this is a trick that people have been using.  After the runner-ups,  someone will throw something funny out  and go,  that was line of the day.  It doesn't work that way, fella.  And it's brought to you by BodogFantasy.net,  free live scoring stats, bios,  and news that will help you win big this season  in fantasy football.  All at BodogFantasy.net. 
[03:51:00]  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  He would have been really heavy if he kept it.  Yeah, right?  Big, fat foreskin.  Yeah, if he had that big, fat, five-pound foreskin  hanging off the top,  like a great big calamari ring  that you could fit around your head.  Runner-up.  Thank you.  You've got a runner-up so far.  How good must these other lines be?  That is the fourth last one.  That's fourth runner-up, man.  Wow.  Let's play another one.  Another runner-up line of the day.  No, we didn't hear you. 
[03:51:30]  What was that?  It could have been a good one.  You said there's nothing worse than the F word.  I go tell Dog that.  We heard you.  Not quite a line of the day,  but an insult of the day.  That was more of a zing.  Yeah, it was a zing.  All right.  Any abuse of Rich Voss, though,  deserves some credit.  Big A, any plugs?  Nothing much, no.  Oh.  And no plugs.  Ron and Fez at noon? 
[03:52:00]  No?  No Ron and Fez today?  What?  Why aren't you saying anything?  Yeah, what?  You don't like those guys anymore?  What happened?  What'd they do to you?  Oh, nothing.  Big A, Big A.  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  Nothing.  You ever falling out?  Oh, not at all.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Is he twitching?  And why are you nodding your head up?  Really?  You're like nodding your head up and down.  I got his call like I see him.  Who was it?  Ronnie?  Ronnie jumped on you?  No, no. 
[03:52:30]  Why are you giving us a thumbs up on that?  I should say that.  Holy shit.  Ronnie, what did he do to you?  He threw you out of the studio?  He doesn't want you in?  No, never.  He was mean to you?  Oh, he was mean to you?  All right.  All right.  Why are you writing notes now?  You can just say it.  Ronnie was being mean.  Okay.  What happened?  Pay.  Nothing. 
[03:53:00]  What the hell is it?  You what?  You want to start getting paid?  No, you're just making things up.  No, you're just making things up.  Making things up on paper.  I know, but the other stuff is real.  What are you paying?  If you're, yeah, you feel if you're working for them, you know, in some capacity, you want  some cash.  I understand.  All right.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  You got a horn from a locomotive in the guy's closet.  Yeah.  And where's hit it?  Right now, a train's hitting a car. 
[03:53:30]  And the engineer's pulling on the horn.  What the hell?  It just sounds like a little lab clock.  That was a funny little tag on that that no one really picked up on.  The whole juxtaposition of train horn and alarm clock.  How silly would that be?  Ring.  That was good.  We'll give that one to Vos, though.  That was Vos.  Yeah, that was Vos.  So we've all had one so far.  Okay.  One more runner-up line of the day.  Ooh.  We can see your golden years being spent growing old together, and here he is dipping it in 
[03:54:00]  a nursing home.  Yeah, but this guy, he's still, he's also in love with the dresser, his lamp, and breakfast.  What beat that runner-up?  That was my favorite.  Nice.  Oh, I'm not disputing.  I'm happy I'm included.  Jim Jefferies, Caroline's Tonight, Tomorrow, and Sunday.  I highly, highly recommend you go see his comedy.  He's amazing.  And as far as Vos is concerned, he will be watching me at the Borgata January 18th and 
[03:54:30]  19th, Martin Luther King's birthday weekend.  Get tickets to Borgata.com at Atlantic City.  All right.  Brokerage this weekend.  All right, guys.  Flannery's Friday.  Brokerage.  Belmar.  I'm very excited about the winner.  Here's your line of the day.  Here comes.  What does I...  All right.  That was a clusterfuck.  Look at that guy on the chair.  What happened, E-Rock?  What did you do wrong?  Oh, now they're pelting him with paper. 
[03:55:00]  E-Rock, what did you do?  No, I don't have my original settings here, so it...  No, no, what did you do wrong?  I hit the line of the day too early instead of it being automated after the...  They're throwing shit at him.  All right, Eric, give it a little shot because you're...  I like this first attempt at an excuse.  My settings aren't properly calibrated.  What did you do?  I hit it at the wrong time.  The board was set to competent, so it was completely foreign to it. 
[03:55:30]  Oh, my God.  Up top.  Yeah, you've got to set that board to beginner.  Go ahead, E-Rock.  Do it again.  You'll be fine.  Line of the day.  Go.  He is...  Christ.  Takes a full...  Goes...  A lot of pressure.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  What does IQ stand for?  Intellectual quotation. 
[03:56:00]  Holy Jesus.  That's the line of the day.  You said it so earnestly as well, didn't you?  You really meant...  He felt good about that.  All right, we've got to get out of here.  Jim, it was a pleasure.  Thank you.  Absolutely, man.  Thank you very much.  Very fun.  Thanks.  If you want to come back...  Very cool.  If you want to come back tomorrow, you're more than welcome.  We're here.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Anytime.  Very good.  All right, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Later.  Bye.  Peace.  My name is William, and I like to wear dresses.
