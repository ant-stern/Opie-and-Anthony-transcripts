<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, frequently veering off on tangents and marked by the hosts' characteristic irreverent and often offensive humor.  The show began with a discussion of their expanding radio market reach into Washington D.C., Columbus, Ohio, and potentially Buffalo, expressing frustration with the inconsistencies between official announcements and the information already leaked online and through other media outlets like Don and Mike's show.  They also discussed a potential competing show in Columbus. This initial segment included tangents on Roger Clemens' Astros contract, predictions of Whoopi Goldberg's morning radio show's failure, and humorous anecdotes about accidents and deaths at Disney theme parks, contrasting the incidents with the parks' rapid cleanup efforts.  A segment of "Homeless Radio" with Tippy Tom was played, featuring his eccentric commentary on computer networking and immigration.  Personal stories about gastrointestinal issues, encounters with celebrities and the mob, and past radio experiences were shared throughout, interspersed with frequent interruptions and insults exchanged between the hosts. A listener submitted a recording of a purported Buffalo radio promo announcing Opie and Anthony's return. Anthony's "white black guy" anecdote was cut short by the end of the broadcast.

Early in the show, Opie recounted a joke about mocking a woman with a prosthetic arm, with Otto contributing the punchline.  They promoted their upcoming appearances with Otto and George in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, and announced Bill Burr as a guest.  The hosts critiqued their show's intro/outro announcements, with Opie demanding changes from Chernoff.  Anthony's enthusiasm for his new iMac sparked a discussion on its features and contrasted it with older technology and the low turnout at a previous CD signing.  A news story about a woman receiving a jaw transplant grown in her back was discussed with graphic and crude humor, including reaction from callers and referencing photos.  The discussion then shifted to TV reporter Arthur Cheyenne's unjust firing for using profanity on live television after being heckled by Opie and Anthony listeners, leading to a broader conversation about media bias and their treatment by the media.

Further segments included listener-submitted videos of crying athletes; a critique of a poorly-received Mets theme song and the resulting death threats; and criticism of a 9/11 themed video game promoted by Andrea Day.  The show incorporated lighthearted interaction with intern Jeff, a Bob Ross impression, and discussion of a listener's New York Times article comment.  The show continued with a discussion about the New York-Boston sports rivalry, particularly referencing Bill Burrâ€™s defiance of it.  This segued into mocking Anthony's clothing choices, followed by more criticism of the poorly received Mets theme song,  leading to a discussion about Big Daddy Kane and a self-deprecating anecdote from Jimmy Norton about his past attempts to emulate rap artists, using the term "wigger."

The show discussed the perceived decline in respect for legendary sports figures and the impact of steroids, debating Babe Ruth's accomplishments and the effects of steroids on sports and rock and roll.  A segment on athletes crying during retirement speeches featured Brett Boone's farewell, leading to a planned "Crying Day" segment featuring clips of Bruce Kelly and E-Rock, the latter's "gayest list of heroes" including Opie and Hulk Hogan.  Discussion of Bob Kelly's knee injury was included.  The "walk" segment detailed crude jokes and comments directed at passersby, interactions with street vendors, and a conversation with "Max," along with the return of a woman previously criticized on the "Whack Bag" website.  The show returned to the studio to discuss Mancow Muller's potential Howard Stern replacement, a suggested new show name ("Rape Kit and Crawlspace") from an intern, and concluded with a "Daily Dump Report."

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on listener-submitted alternate show names, many of which were crude and sexually suggestive.  *Last Comic Standing* was heavily dissected, with clips and vulgar commentary on various comedians' performances, including Lee Evans (who received a positive review), Billy Conley, Dan, Angel Salazar, Mike Buschetti, Gabriel Iglesias ("Fluffy"), Josh Blue, Nikki, and April Macy. The hosts also heavily criticized the judges.  British comedian Lee Evans was a guest, discussing his show and reviews. The conversation included a lengthy and inappropriate tangent on anal bleaching. The segment ended with promotion of Jim Norton's DVD signing and a frustrated discussion of the poorly organized promotion of "Jimmy Day."

The show extensively discussed Jim Norton's "Jimmy Day," detailing the cancelled *Lucky Louie* preview at the Hard Rock Cafe due to scheduling conflicts, Norton's frustration, and the brainstorming of elaborate additions, including a themed procession, a hotel room for Anthony, and potential celebrity guests.  Brett Ratner, director of *X-Men: The Last Stand*, was a guest, discussing the film's production, budget, his past work, a trip to Cuba, and interactions with internet critics and Jessica Simpson.  Listener suggestions for "Jimmy Day," including sexually explicit ones, and a listener email proposing a rotten food-eating contest were also discussed.  An upcoming "Big AIDS Giveaway" was briefly mentioned, and the segment concluded with Opie singing a song.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  What?  Can you hear me?  No!  Shut up!  I'm Ian Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rapid radio retards.  Wow.  We're dummies.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony. 
[00:00:30]  Opie.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slumped, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  He looks like Chuckie.  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boobs that we paint him out to be.  E-Rock!  Oh, please, going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care!  Shut up!  No. 
[00:01:00]  What's wrong, Eric?  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian Ass.  Shut up!  Of course not.  But enough of this palaver.  What a palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  What a palaver.  I wish I could play that Jeff Goldblum clip from yesterday. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, that was a lot of fun on the second half of the Opian Anthony program.  God.  Hey, good morning.  It's the Opian Anthony show, actually.  1-866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-FREE is the phone number.  Man.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Uh-oh.  Like the bird fluke.  There's rumors all over the place that the virus is spreading in the very near future  to other cities.  Oh, I read things.  I read things in the paper and then I hear, oh, don't talk about it. 
[00:02:00]  What is with the business world?  What is with the corporate America that...  Did you see what happened with Clemens?  Clemens re-signed with Houston, right?  Uh, 13 million bucks.  It was all over yesterday and all it said was, Clemens and his management deny that this  is happening.  And then today it's like, yeah, we signed with them.  Did they get the deal like in a day? 
[00:02:30]  Or were they told, don't say anything?  We're still getting the press release together.  We're still getting it all together and this one's got to know and this guy...  Like, it's all such corporate crap.  Everyone else knows.  It's printed everywhere.  And then the principals in the whole thing aren't even allowed to mention it or talk about  it.  Or I don't know if you even can mention it or can't.  Because this one thinks this one should know first and this one...  Ah, we're going to Washington. 
[00:03:00]  Shut up.  It's everywhere.  Yes, we're going to JFK.  Enough.  Christ on a pony.  It's all about the almighty dollar.  Oh, you know, Jim, you got a point and it's right on top of your cute little head.  There was supposed to be a press release yesterday, but XM needed their quote in the press release.  Oh, enough.  Here's the press release.  Yeah, we're going.  There you go.  Release that bit of press.  I'm sick of it.  I'm sick of this corporate garbage. 
[00:03:30]  The corporate crap.  And we got two bosses and they got to try to get along.  So CBS wanted to throw a press release out there saying that the virus is spreading to  a few more cities.  And XM's like, wait a minute.  Where's the quote from us?  Where's the quote from us?  But we want to be part.  And then other people saying, well, put out your own press release.  Do that.  Right.  Which, you know, is fine.  I don't care if you can coordinate something together.  More power to you.  You know, companies working together. 
[00:04:00]  It's a very difficult thing.  That's why when there's mergers and takeovers of companies, when they combine, it's never  both names.  It's usually one name takes over.  They kick out a bunch of people and it just becomes a bigger version of one of the companies.  Yeah.  So they begged us not to talk about it.  And next thing you know, we're looking on the websites and it's everywhere.  It's like, oh, great.  Let everyone else report it except for the people that are going to be doing the show.  Yeah.  The people that are excited about it and want to talk about it.  And then, yeah.  And we have a voice. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  We're heard by a lot of people.  Yeah.  So we don't break the news.  Let everyone else break the news.  Yeah.  Don and Mike mentioned it.  Don and Mike in Washington was talking about it.  Yeah.  Like crazy.  DCRTV.com talking about our move to Washington like crazy.  The New York radio message board talking about our move like crazy, which is great.  Go ahead.  Talk about it.  But, I mean, we'd like to, you know, chime in since we're kind of involved.  And there may be other cities. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Are we allowed to mention that?  Oh, there are.  I hear.  I hear the big wazoo in Columbus.  They're already running promos, but we're not allowed to talk about it.  Promos.  How can a station run promos yet?  We can't announce it yet.  Isn't that announced?  It's just amazing to me.  Oh, it really is.  Maybe they're just trying to reword the press release because they want to get my name right.  Jimmy Norton. 
[00:05:30]  James will work also.  You got Jimmy Day.  Jimmy.  Yes.  Or Jim.  You got your Jimmy Day coming.  Jim.  Detail soon, right?  Yeah, hopefully.  I thought, I thought.  Otherwise, we'll be like, Jimmy Day was yesterday and we didn't report on it.  That would be the greatest that we have Jimmy Day, but we don't tell anybody.  And that's Sunday at 6 a.m.  And have Jimmy just show up at a location and he's all by himself just sitting there waiting  for everyone to show up for his little party.  The press release comes out the day after.  Like Peter Brady.  Hi, guys. 
[00:06:00]  Surprise for me.  Running with an HBO DVD to sign.  Hi.  Where is everybody?  Poot toot toot.  Then they go out and buy you a bicycle.  Is that what they did?  Yeah, the faggot and his wife.  I didn't buy it.  And his wife said, oh, hon, he's going to need a seat on it.  He said, I never did.  Why should he?  So you're announcing that we're going to be on in Washington?  I'm not announcing anything.  I'm just reading what I read in the paper.  That's what they tell me. 
[00:06:30]  That's what they tell me, the newspapers, and they're never wrong.  And it sounds like there's going to be a show in Columbus that sounds a lot like us.  Right.  Maybe it is us.  I think it could be.  It is us.  Is there another Opie and Anthony out there?  I know that some radio shows have similar names.  Some are even the same.  I don't know.  But I have yet to hear another Opie and Anthony out there.  So maybe it's a new, young, up-and-coming team.  And they've been hired.  Besides Washington and Columbus, is there maybe two other cities? 
[00:07:00]  Could be.  Could be.  I've heard things.  Oh, for the love of God.  Supposedly, well, no one talked to us yesterday about it, so.  No.  Maybe there will be a press release today.  How's that?  That's what I heard.  Maybe there will be a press release today.  I heard there was supposed to be one a few days ago.  Yeah.  You know, something called lead time would be nice.  You know, if you're supposed to start, let's hypothetically say we're supposed to start in some cities on Monday. 
[00:07:30]  Wouldn't you want to give those cities a little advance notice?  And by little, I mean a day?  A weekend would be nice.  Stupid weekends are worthless in radio, by the way.  They're worthless.  No one reads the papers.  No one really watches the news.  You're out doing stuff.  You want to address these things early the week before, at the very least. 
[00:08:00]  And give that week the chance to do some press, to build it up, to let people know you're coming.  But because people can't get their crap together, it runs into Thursday and then Friday.  And before you know it, you're starting and no one's heard crap about it.  You're starting from nowhere.  Let's go to John at Westchester.  John, what's up?  I just want to know why you're ripping off Howard by going to other cities.  All right, John. 
[00:08:30]  That's very funny.  Well, according to Howard, we're failing miserably.  So we continue to fail.  The failure continues on.  Because it's pretty obvious we're going to be added to more cities in the very near future.  We're failing on a national level.  But if you listen to Howard, he says we're failing miserably.  You know, it's proof that we failed on satellite because we had to start doing commercial radio again.  Yeah, we had to.  Right.  That's something we wanted to do right from the start.  Right.  Oh, brother. 
[00:09:00]  What a dope.  It's not the best move to make because you have both satellite and terrestrial radio, which is the best move to make.  You do the outrageous stuff on satellite, and you keep yourself out of trouble, but you still put on a fun show on FM radio.  It's completely possible and doable, and it's the move to make.  Yeah.  You don't cornhole yourself.  Was I going to say cornhole yourself?  Certainly were.  It's either pigeonhole or â€“ well, you never cornhole yourself. 
[00:09:30]  Let me make that perfectly clear.  That's right.  You get a friend.  Absolutely.  You get a fist in some oil.  I am just an ass.  Hey, let's go to Brian in Minnesota.  Pigeonhole.  Brian.  Hey, boys.  What's up?  Make it fast.  We're on a roll already.  Got to keep the energy up.  Just want to stop my congratulations on your future failures.  Thank you, Brian.  Yes, we are failing all over the place.  Yeah.  You know what?  We need the XM Nation to help us out today.  If anyone's listening to us on XM in the Columbus, Ohio area, could you tell us what's going on at the Big Wazoo? 
[00:10:00]  I'm hearing they're running promos like crazy that we're coming back.  And I'm not stupid.  I'm not going to say anything that shouldn't be said.  But I will say this.  Me and Opie were in a room with someone of very high profile yesterday.  And we were talking about things that are very big, you know, like big opportunities, big ideas, big moves, things like that. 
[00:10:30]  That's all I'm saying about that.  So the failure, the failure just continues to climb up the ladder to bigger and better things.  And what's up with Buffalo Paul is saying that we're going to Buffalo?  What?  Holy crap.  Worst kept secret in radio.  Buffalo Paul on the instant feedback.  Explain what you just sent.  Because he sent a message that says nice.  It says nice.  O&A comes back to Buffalo radio promo. 
[00:11:00]  And then it gives a link to some kind of possible O&A return to Buffalo promo they're running.  Huh.  We should maybe listen to that.  Interesting.  Oh, my God.  That's a whole other animal.  They got to get their you-know-what together behind the scenes.  They have to.  We can't be the last people to announce stuff.  It's so difficult.  It's like two machines that don't really know how to talk to each other. 
[00:11:30]  You can't network.  You ever have problems networking your computers at home?  And you're like, this should work.  I should just be able to plug this one into this one and they should talk to each other.  But no.  Somehow there's a router in the middle.  And if you don't have the IP number right and this doesn't work and the wizard can't figure it out.  And you just get mad and smash things.  That's the point we get to.  Well, maybe we'll have some announcements later today. 
[00:12:00]  Later this morning, okay?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Because no one contacted us last night.  Yeah.  They did beg us to lay off this yesterday.  But I didn't get an updated email.  And we did.  We didn't say anything yesterday.  Right.  And then I heard today.  I'm not going to sit here while you cut that thing open and watch that little kitten or boy spill out all over the dock.  No, I will not sit here and let, you know, days go by, valuable days where we can be informing people of things.  Because of what amounts to a clerical error. 
[00:12:30]  You're a clerk.  We won't be denied, Dan.  We won't be ignored.  Wait, you got the Buffalo promo, E-Rock?  The Buffalo promo.  What the hell is this about?  I swear to you.  Are they running this on a radio station?  Did you listen to it?  Yeah.  Okay.  Here we go.  Is it real or is it one of the listeners made it up?  Buffalo Paul sent this in from Buffalo.  He's a hardcore O&A listener.  He's an O&A pest.  Right.  He really helps us out a lot in the Buffalo area. 
[00:13:00]  And he sent this in.  Hey, Buffalo, it's your old pals, Opie and Anthony.  And we're finally coming back.  Wait, can you start over?  Because I was talking over that.  Uh-oh.  You're half asleep today, aren't you?  Yes, you are.  He's three quarters asleep, E-Rock.  I was still trying to set it up.  So this is running supposedly on a radio station up in Buffalo.  But this is Opie and Anthony doing it, you're saying, Hawk?  All right, hit it.  Hey, Buffalo, it's your old pals, Opie and Anthony.  And we're finally coming back to radio.  Yes.  Now we're going to have the freedom to say what we want to say when we want to say it. 
[00:13:30]  Uh-oh.  That's a nice change, huh?  No one watching over our shoulder anymore.  We miss you guys.  It's been too long.  We can't wait to get back on the air, that's for sure.  What is that?  That's probably a promo for XM Satellite.  Yeah, yeah.  What a dope, Paul.  That's a promo for XM Satellite.  What an idiot.  When we were signing on, we obviously wanted to let some of the local markets that we were  in know that we were back.  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  You jackass.  All right, let's go to Mike in Columbus.  Mike, what's going on?  Morning, boys.  Hey, Mike.  What do you say, Bill?  We paint each other up.  Yeah, that's right.  That's right.  So, hey, man, a guy who works at the station here at Wazoo said you boys are going to be  back on in the afternoons here shortly.  Oh, yeah?  Are they running promos, though?  I'm hearing they're running promos.  Yep, they got a couple promos going, and I guess they want to keep her over in the mornings  so they're going to run you guys in the afternoons like you were on before.  Yeah, that's what I heard.  Well, if you can find the promo, I would love to hear it today. 
[00:14:30]  All right, man.  I'll try to get it for you.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Punch down.  See you.  All right.  Let's say hi to Brandon in Los Angeles.  Brandon, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, listen, man, I stay up until 3 o'clock in the morning to hear you guys on the internet.  What's the deal with getting on the regular radio out here?  In L.A.?  Yeah.  We're just waiting for Adam Carolla to fail.  She's stopping.  We're just waiting.  We're just waiting.  We're just waiting.  We're in the bullpen.  Waiting.  We're in the bullpen just waiting.  No way.  Oh, baby. 
[00:15:00]  We got to get a little success here in New York and in the other cities we're being syndicated  to, and then we'll see what happens.  How's that sound?  That's cool, man.  Hey, I'm stoked you guys are back on.  I was out in Jersey back in, what was it, a 102 when you guys were on?  Oh, right on.  Yeah.  Still using stoked out there in L.A., by the way.  Let us know when you're back in town here.  We'll all sit down and reminisce about those days.  I love it, Brandon.  You're bitching.  In other radio news, we got to be on top of our game here in New York City.  Yeah, see, we're at a whole new level now. 
[00:15:30]  It's going to get scary.  The competition's getting crazy in New York radio.  I heard.  Whoopie in the morning.  Look out.  Here comes Whoopie Goldberg.  At least get the name of the show right.  It's Whoopie in the morning.  It's Wake Up With Whoopie.  Let's wake up with it.  Let me explain to you what Wake Up With Whoopie sounds like.  All the letters match. 
[00:16:00]  Good thing she's doing a morning show.  Otherwise, it would be nighttime.  It would probably be just like a different radio show.  Wake Up With Whoopie.  Wake Up With Whoopie.  Whoopie Goldberg has decided to throw her hat into the wonderful world of radio.  Bozy, bozy, boop.  Zinny, boop.  Yeah.  This is Dave Lee Roth all over again.  Yeah, a lot of people are saying Whoopie Lee Roth.  She's replacing Goomba Johnny's show, right?  Yeah.  Why would they do that? 
[00:16:30]  Goomba and Balthazar.  Yeah, that's great.  Goomba Johnny's going to get a hit on that station now.  It would be funny if he was doing mornings here next week.  Yeah.  That's really smart.  Fire a guy that's connected to the mob.  That's brilliant.  Jesus, Opie.  I don't know where you get your information from, Opie.  But Opie said that Anthony doesn't have any idea what goes on.  I read the papers and I respect the boys and the mob.  Let me tell you something.  I've met Goomba Johnny down at Caroline's a couple of times.  He's a fine gentleman. 
[00:17:00]  And I have no issues or problems with him.  And I don't know what this man does.  I know he does radio.  And that is it.  We've just heard things.  I have heard nothing.  And we've read things in the paper.  The wee stuff you were saying, Opie.  No, you were just saying this behind the scenes before he came into the studio.  Anthony knows nothing.  I know as a paisan, as a fellow paisan, I know nothing.  I've heard nothing.  And I acknowledge nothing. 
[00:17:30]  You know what's scary about you being Italian?  Yeah.  Like, you just know things.  And I've never questioned it.  I don't like talking to you about it.  But when they were looking for Jimmy Hoffa in the farm in, where was it?  Michigan, was it?  Detroit?  Where were they?  Yeah, Detroit.  Outside Detroit?  You said day one, oh, they're not going to find him there.  They ain't going to find him there.  Like, you just knew.  You just kind of have it in your blood.  And I guess they just called off the search a couple days off.  That was stupid.  Man, Anthony knew from day one. 
[00:18:00]  I'm like, I don't even want to know how you knew that.  Why you know that.  He's not at my house.  He's not staying there.  Goomba Johnny, he actually helped me.  I was involved in a thing with a hooker in a brothel.  And I woke up.  I passed out.  She was dead and bloody.  And thank God that he was there for me.  So the guy's a good friend.  I would never disparage.  Vito Corleone.  So Whoopi's going to be doing some morning radio here in New York.  That should be terrific. 
[00:18:30]  Now I'm scared.  Because Whoopi.  Wake up with Whoopi.  How do you compete?  Wake up with Whoopi.  That is atrocious.  It really is.  Maybe if you're a hot piece of ass, you would use that as your show name.  Wake up with Whoopi.  Wake up with Whoopi.  We've talked about celebrities that do radio shows.  It's a great thing.  A lot of them make great guests.  They make great guests.  They come in.  They're entertaining.  They tell their stories. 
[00:19:00]  The host of the show guides them through their stories or whatever.  And then someone gets a bright idea going, I heard her on the radio and it was very good.  Let's give her her own show or him.  And they get on there themselves and are at a loss of how to carry on a program for four hours a day every day.  Maybe the first day works out good.  It's a little interesting, something like that.  But then after a while, it's just kind of Whoopi going what? 
[00:19:30]  How big was Ted Danson?  What could she possibly add?  It's funny.  These radio execs, they don't get it.  They continue to hire these celebrities.  You got to hire radio guys.  Yeah.  And I say radio guys.  Yeah.  Stop with the celebrities.  Where's Wake up with Whoopi being taped?  Is that New York?  Is she doing it here in New York?  I guess she'll do it in New York.  I believe she's doing it from New York.  These celebrities don't have the work ethic it takes to put on a radio show. 
[00:20:00]  They're spoiled.  They're spoiled.  They don't work hard.  They film a movie every once in a while.  They're in a trailer just hanging out for hours to film a two-minute scene, and that's it for the day.  I mean, stop.  I mean, stop.  How difficult it is.  They have no idea.  Whoopi will fail within four months.  Whoa.  Is that your prediction?  Now, you gave David Lee Roth how long?  Three months.  And he was right.  Opie said three months.  Opie was right.  Opie was right.  You're giving her an extra month.  Right.  I said, yeah, I did say David Lee Roth was three months.  You're giving her the comic month because she's a comic, so she'll probably be able to maintain 
[00:20:30]  at least enough talking and stories.  She was a comic.  And she knows more.  Another month.  She knows a lot of funny people, so she'll be able to ride that out for a little while.  Oh, you think a guest will come on?  Her, Her, Rubbin.  Her, Her.  Hey, Whoopi.  Her, you got your radio show.  Her, Her.  Wake up with Whoopi.  We'll be dried up in four months.  But let's be honest.  It's already dried up, isn't it?  Isn't it?  I don't know.  I want to hear the girl, Nettie, from A Color Purple, I understand, is doing. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, that'd be nice.  Have a couple of, maybe Danny Glover will come on.  That would be interesting.  Okay.  Maybe some guests.  You think she's going to be able to get, like, that caliber of Hollywood guests?  Goldthwait from the films?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Well, we're scared.  Certainly, certainly.  We're scared here.  We're scared here in New York, so wake up with Whoopi.  We can't wait.  When's it start, Hope?  I can't wait to wake up with Whoopi.  Oh, who knows?  Who knows?  Is it today, Ben?  No.  We're competing with Whoopi.  No.  We're competing with Whoopi.  No, it doesn't start until July. 
[00:21:30]  I don't want to compete with Whoopi.  I believe that I heard they're going to do some run-through shows first.  Oh, no.  For, like, a week or so.  Will they be on the air?  Well, probably.  When they tell you to do run-through shows, that means they don't even have confidence.  Run-through shows and shows that you're tweaking things.  Those are key words to uh-oh.  Do you realize that I signed the contract the day before we started here?  Yeah, bam, you're on the air.  Bam, you're on the air. 
[00:22:00]  No warm-up shows.  None of that crap.  Any W they made us do a couple of shows at, like, 2 in the morning.  But it was on the radio.  Yeah, it was on the air.  And that was insulting.  I wanted to rat that guy in the head.  Gary Wall.  It'd be funny if we found out that, like, these first three or four weeks here have all been, like, just kind of not going out over the airwaves.  They're just test shows.  Guys, we wanted to tell you in a press release, but we couldn't get it together with the other company.  All right, so that's big news in New York radio.  Yeah.  Or who, I don't know. 
[00:22:30]  I think it's a complete joke that they're trying another celebrity in New York radio.  Why would, I thought Johnny and the other guy were doing good.  Baltazar.  Yeah, Baltazar, we're doing well.  Yeah, Baltazar, we met him when we were doing Boston radio.  He's a good guy.  Those guys were very nice.  And then Goomba Johnny was always good to us when we saw him out in the comedy club.  Yeah, when we were in exile.  That gigantic head of his.  Hey, before we take our first break.  Oh, he has a solid skull.  Before we take our first break, another clip from Homeless Radio. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, yeah.  We just started this bit on XM a little while ago.  We're going to continue this.  We wanted to go home early, so we just kind of let a homeless guy do radio for, like, almost an hour, I guess.  He was just sitting in the studio by himself.  It was Tippy Tom that we had over here.  Tippy Tom.  We just gave him a mic, and we gave him a fan to kind of just, you know, get some phone calls on the air.  Kind of keep it flowing.  And, yeah, he was addressing a lot of important issues.  Right.  Well, here's Tippy Tom. 
[00:23:30]  What's up?  What's up?  This guy, Adam Buckman's making me laugh.  He's smacking the stupid Katie Couric.  Oh, we'll get into that next.  It's great.  Oh, yeah, definitely got to get into that one.  I like the good stuff, man, because we'll get into the Katie Couric thing next.  But here's the Tippy Tom show.  It's homeless radio.  A little clip here.  Tippy Tom talking about computer networking.  All right.  We've got another question for you, Tom.  Sonny Ferrelli.  Go ahead.  Ferrelli.  Jeez, I hate that, too.  Yeah.  Hey, Tippy Tom.  How you doing there?  I got a question. 
[00:24:00]  I've got this Dell computer, and I've got a desktop, and I've got a laptop.  I've got to know how to network those.  Can you help me out there, buddy?  Yeah.  You plug them both in together, and you plug it into the wall, and then you put a battery  in between the cord and blow them up.  All right?  And that way, there, you have no problem with your boxes.  Oh, beautiful, man.  Because I had to do something.  Yeah, you blow them up.  All right?  Or set them on fire.  Throw a little gasoline on top of them and light them up and get rid of them. 
[00:24:30]  You don't need them anyway.  You don't need them.  You don't need computers anyway.  No, of course not.  Because he doesn't.  You want to hear another one?  The guy thought gas was $1.50 a gallon.  Yeah.  Well, here's Tippy Tom talking about immigration.  Oh, very important issue.  A taste of homeless radio.  What else you got to ask me?  We had some people on the feedback wanting to hear your thoughts about the immigration 
[00:25:00]  situation.  All right, all right.  All these people that come in here illegally?  Yeah, them.  I'm all for it.  I want them here in my home.  Yes.  They come to a better country.  We're a good country.  We're good people.  Yes.  Come here, and you're welcome in my book.  I do the best you can.  They work hard.  They work the lowest jobs we got, and they do the best they can to build a better life. 
[00:25:30]  Yes, I don't care if they come here illegally or not.  No.  You're welcome.  I came here illegally 100 years ago.  So, what the f*** am I to say that you can't come here?  No.  You get here?  Get here.  That's the way it is.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America. 
[00:26:00]  Will it be spreading further today?  Ooh.  I don't know.  Very near future.  Maybe there will be a press release today.  Maybe there won't.  1-866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-FREE.  I got a sour stomach.  Sour stomach.  Jimmy's got a sour stomach.  Mine actually, honest to God, I get nervous. 
[00:26:30]  And it smells just like the sushi I had last night, which I don't feel sick.  I just feel sick.  And what did you have last night, O.P.?  What?  Did you have sushi?  Two days ago.  This is a two-day thing that's been happening with me.  I was eating sushi outside.  Damn sushi.  It was probably close to 90 two days ago here in New York City, and I decided to have sushi outside.  And then I decided to order a few pieces of fish that probably sit around.  Turning.  They started to turn. 
[00:27:00]  The one thing about sushi, they always say, when you go to a sushi place, order the stuff that they sell a lot of.  Yeah.  Your salmons, your tunas.  Yeah, because the other stuff is going to sit there.  They'll sit there for an extra day or two, and, you know, in this hot weather, I don't care.  You know, it's going to spoil a little faster.  I know they refrigerate and all that, but it's out long enough to maybe get a few things growing on it.  There's so many sushi places now that, like, you got to watch where you go, or you're going to end up like you two with sour stomach. 
[00:27:30]  No, no, I don't feel.  I always have a sour stomach.  Like, I always have gas.  I don't feel bad, though.  The sushi was great last night.  We'll vouch for you.  I always have gas.  Yeah, gas is easy, man.  By the end of the day, you're just a wreck.  And he can just, he can call out his powers of wind.  Powers of wind!  We get in the elevator, and he's just letting loose, and there are people in there that have nothing to do with the show. 
[00:28:00]  We were getting into the elevator yesterday to go up to XM, and there's other people that work in the building.  And this woman gets in, and Jimmy just lets one go, and I start cracking up hysterical because I just find it so funny I can't deal with it.  And I turn and just face the corner, and I shake and laugh.  And the woman sees all the microphones and goes, oh, are you a show?  Yeah, what show are you guys?  And Jimmy goes, yeah. 
[00:28:30]  He goes, what show are you?  And Jimmy looks right at him and goes, the Mind Your Own Business show.  This poor old woman is just sitting there with this perplexed look, waiting for her floor.  And then I'm waiting for the, well, I'm just kidding, you know?  No.  He never lets her off the hook.  No.  And we all leave the elevator very uncomfortable.  The smelly elevator.  Very uncomfortable.  The smelly vader.  What a coward I am.  Little old lady.  If she was a 6'5 black guy, I would have said, Opie Anthony, sir, I hope you enjoy it.  Yeah, exactly.  She was a 5'4 guy, just a man you would have backed away. 
[00:29:00]  It's the old women you pick on.  Absolutely.  And then I punched her in the face and walked off.  Funniest part of the day.  Absolutely, and hottest.  So, you know, the gas is one thing, but I got such a sour stomach.  What is a sour stomach?  It's just, you know, gurgly.  Is it percolating?  Are you nauseous?  And it's out of my stomach now, and it's lower.  Uh-oh.  And let's just put it this way.  It's working its way down.  You ever, uh...  You ever, uh... 
[00:29:30]  Careful.  Careful.  You ever, you know, have to do number two, and you'll leave the bathroom, and you're embarrassed?  And there's no one around, but you're embarrassed because it smells like baby diapers?  Not only am I not embarrassed, I send other people in quickly under false pretenses.  Yeah, Jimmy will be like, there's something in here you gotta see.  There's gold in there.  Go grab it.  We can all agree.  You get a little older.  You know, it doesn't smell like baby diapers anymore, unless you have a sour stomach, and 
[00:30:00]  then you're just mortified, and there's no one around.  You're just mortified in your own skin.  Nothing beats the scent of an oil refinery.  Have you ever left and went like, oh my god, this room now smells like a refinery?  Like, you actually smell raw petroleum.  That's too much peanut butter in your diet.  I don't know what that is.  It's peanut butter.  Trust me.  I know that one, too.  It's like, it's crude oil. 
[00:30:30]  It's peanut butter.  I almost threw up during my workout yesterday.  This is what a little fat nobody I am.  I was doing those crunches like the soccer mom on the ball in the gym.  Yeah.  And I have bad equilibrium.  I get dizzy very quickly.  Oh, Jesus.  So I was on the ball, and I was trying to go all the way back to stretch out my stomach  and then come all the way up, but it made me really dizzy.  And on my way up, I had to actually stop because I started to throw up into my mouth.  Wait, you got dizzy so fast that it gave you motion sickness?  Yeah.  Where you went to vomit in one move?  I can't lay on my, well, I started to feel queasy and then come back up. 
[00:31:00]  I was like, eh.  And I can't lay on my back even.  If I lay on my back, like in coffin pose, I get dizzy.  Ooh.  I have to sleep on my sides.  Can you spin around?  I certainly can.  What happens?  You just get all dizzy and throw up.  Only if I meet a gentleman, and he wants to see what I'm wearing.  He wants to see me in my underpants, and he tells me to spin around, and I can.  Underpants.  I can't.  I'll pirouette quickly.  Hey, you were talking about Katie Couric before the break there, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Everyone is commenting about Katie Couric's three-hour farewell yesterday. 
[00:31:30]  Katie Day.  I know what's great about life.  If you really, really think your life is important, use the Katie Couric thing as a good example.  Okay.  Watch the Today Show today.  Yeah.  They're hosing down the set.  Hose it down.  It's like she never even did TV for 15 years for them.  All right.  If I got to watch this guy swab his blowhole one more goddamn time, enough.  We get it.  Smoking gives you cancer.  Nothing will ever be the same again. 
[00:32:00]  Not even the simple things.  What?  The guy's got to swab out the open hole?  It's this friggin' health commercial, the PSA that they're running, every two minutes,  where the old Spanish guy is swabbing his blowhole.  How does food not fall out?  Like when you're eating, how do you, like if you have to eat on your back?  Sir, the hole goes into your trachea.  That's right.  It is separated.  That's a different tube.  Your esophagus is where the food goes, and it is separated by a little flap called the 
[00:32:30]  epiglottis, which keeps food from going into your windpipe.  Does it?  Yeah.  So what they do is cut open the, yes.  You didn't graduate high school, so how do you know that?  I found that out on Discovery Channel.  Esophagus?  Esophagus.  No, no, no.  Esophagus, yes.  But what's the skin flap?  Oh, the epiglottis.  It's a little flap that flaps closed when you swallow, so the food doesn't go down into 
[00:33:00]  your lungs.  I finally figured out what Eric reminds me of.  An epiglottis?  A talking epiglottis.  Well, look at the face he made at you.  All I wish is his television sometimes.  No, he's making the face.  Iraq makes the best annoyed faces.  No, no, he's making the face.  I'll tell you why.  Because I wanted to finish the bit that we've been doing for two years, and I can't push  the...  Look, two years.  Two.  Iraq.  Look.  What?  It has a curse in it.  Oh.  Way to use second grade terminology.  Oh, it's got a bad word in it.  But I thought this instant replay is clean for this side of the show. 
[00:33:30]  So why is it still on my template?  Anything on the template that you know includes a curse will just be blank.  I was informed by Than of that.  Oh, thank you.  So I can't play like that one.  See, this side of the Opie and Anthony show, they have no idea that we ask Anthony how he  knows crap, because Anthony knows a little bit about everything, which makes me and Jimmy  very uncomfortable at times, because we look at him dumbfounded, like, uh, I just knew  it was a flappy thing, but you knew the name of the flappy thing.  Yeah.  Epiglottis. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, whatever.  It's not Jimmy knows.  I don't feel like remembering that word.  Please do.  And then, uh, and then we play this little sweeper about Anthony being a professor and  that he knows a little bit about everything.  But I can't play it.  You can't play it, because we've got to bleep out the bad word.  When I'm chilly, I want to make a blanket of epiglottises sewn together and lay under  them and breathe them in.  I loathe the epiglottises.  I have to go to Nazi Germany to find one of those.  So anyway, uh, Katie Couric is done.  They're hosing down the set, getting, uh, ready for the new broad. 
[00:34:30]  And everyone's reporting.  The new game.  Everyone's reporting on the farewell, and, uh, something made Jimmy laugh as we went to  break.  This guy, Adam Buckman in the post, it's just, the title is St. Katie's Sobfest is Icky Sicky.  There's a picture of her wiping a tear off her stupid face, and she literally looks  65 years old.  Yeah, I was going to say, if you want to see what Katie Couric really looks like when,  uh, all those studio lights and the filters they probably throw in the cameras and all 
[00:35:00]  the makeup is gone, look at this picture in the post today.  She looks like the Crypt Keeper.  Just a stupid old face and a rot, like the old lady neck with that dumb, like, thick veins.  She actually looks like a clown after a clown wipes off half, half its makeup.  They, they were, uh, she was hired years ago as the perky young reporter.  Remember?  Yeah.  Perky.  That's all you heard about her was perky.  And then they tried to keep the perky thing going, but you can't be perky at that age.  It says, uh, what, uh, what's new for Katie Couric? 
[00:35:30]  How about sainthood?  And then Buckman just goes on to shred this awful show and he goes, you'd think Couric  was mother Teresa by the way everyone carried on about her.  And then this made me laugh because they were talking about all the laughs and stuff.  He goes, with Couric as his co-anchor, Lauer said he enjoyed millions of laughs while she  drank countless cups of coffee.  I'm surprised they didn't assign some intern to go back through the 15 years of videotape  to count the coffee cups.  That's funny. 
[00:36:00]  That really was a pukey little tribute.  Three hours for this broad opinion.  Three hours for a send off.  Who else gets that?  She's not dying of prostate cancer.  She's leaving.  Yeah.  And now.  Going to some other station.  You'll see her there.  Well, she's going to the competitor.  Yeah.  Wait, she's coming over here.  Is she?  Yeah.  She's working for the same company we're working for.  Welcome, Katie.  Think we'll get her on?  No.  No.  Of course not.  Never.  Of course not.  Never, ever happened.  I disagree.  I mean, if she comes on, that's a little show.  Yeah, sure.  But starting today, the Today Show, they've hosed down the set and, you know, there's going 
[00:36:30]  to be no mention of Katie Kerr.  Hosed it down.  She is now gone.  Persona non grata.  She will never be seen there again.  Never be referred to.  And that's it.  They got a new person in there.  They've been doing that since 1977.  And look how quickly it ends.  They have that three-hour SAP Fest yesterday.  And then, like we say, when someone gets killed at Disney, they just hose it down, put the 
[00:37:00]  little mickey up for a little while.  Under maintenance.  Come back later.  They hose it down.  And then, with nary an investigation, open the gates and let the people back in.  How many people have to die on that mission space thing before they close that ride down?  Some worker just humming as he's, you know, mopping up blood.  Whistle while you work.  Exactly.  Whistle while you work.  And just like buckets of blood.  And brain matter.  Are coming up.  One of my favorite Disney deaths. 
[00:37:30]  There's a whole website dedicated to Disney deaths.  And they really don't make the news as big as they should.  They report them.  But, like we say, they just hose it down and get the rides running again.  We got to keep this going.  We can't make it look bad.  One of my favorites was Disneyland.  They have that big ship, the Columbia, that goes around with the Mark Twain steam paddle  wheel ship.  I was on that, by the way. 
[00:38:00]  Everyone was on it at some point.  It's a fun little ride around Tom Sawyer Island.  I love Disney.  Most of the Disney rides stink.  I love Disney.  Yo-ho, yo-ho.  Look, he's moving and he looks like a robot.  They need to update those damn rides.  It's the happiest place on earth.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  That's what they call it.  What's the one where you're 10,000 leagues under the sea?  They closed that years ago.  All right.  But, yeah, it's been a while since I've been down there. 
[00:38:30]  We are now.  And they make it sound like you're very, very, very deep into the ocean.  We are now going beneath the Arctic ice caps.  Dive.  Dive.  Dive.  You look up.  You see people waiting online for the autotopia.  You can see, like, the surface of the water is two feet above your window.  Yeah, you look up and all you see is fat calves.  Sir, there's an octopus off the starboard side.  Oh, let me look. 
[00:39:00]  And it's some goofy plastic octopus.  You see the strings holding the fish up.  No, it's just some bratty kid screaming, yelling,  Mommy, Mommy, I want a Mickey Mouse ice cream pound.  It's like, why are we on an atomic sub with children with mouse ears on?  This is totally ruining the illusion.  Maybe they've been caught up in some kind of a nuclear spill,  and they're kind of retarded.  That could be.  And they're white children with black ears.  What was the...  They've updated some of the...  What was the dumb attraction where they were talking about the future,  and it's the future if it was 1970, maybe? 
[00:39:30]  Brought to you by Monsanto,  where we will shrink you.  Remember that one?  They shrunk you down.  You are now the size of a molecule.  Look at what's got...  Sponsored by AT&T.  What's Monsanto?  Monsanto is something from, like, years ago.  I don't even know.  Is it still there?  But I remember going in through the ride,  and they would shrink you down.  Do you?  And it was sponsored by Monsanto.  Monsanto, that's Whoopi's co-host. 
[00:40:00]  Great.  What did you say, Eric?  It's the Carousel of Progress.  No, no, no.  It was the one where they shrink you down.  It was called...  The Carousel of Progress, by the way,  another death in the Carousel of Progress.  There was something called America Sings,  and that's what they turned the Carousel of Progress into.  And what would happen is you'd sit in a stage,  and it was in the round.  And you would sit around a stage,  and instead of people changing the stage,  the whole audience would rotate  to another portion of the stage. 
[00:40:30]  So I guess a quarter of the audience  is seeing something different every time  as they rotate.  Well, a poor girl worker  got in between some of the gear workings  of the stage and was crushed to death.  Please tell me she was beheaded.  I don't know.  She was just completely, like,  corrugated through some gear work.  What year was that?  That was probably 75.  Yeah.  Around 75. 
[00:41:00]  It was a while ago.  But how did you remember it was sponsored by...  Because they pushed these things...  What was it?  Monsanto.  Monsanto.  It was like you went into a microscope,  and you slowly got smaller and smaller  to show you, like,  what happened on, like,  small things, like paramecium.  Someone's saying it was called Body Wars?  No, that's something different.  That was a newer thing.  I'm talking old school.  I'm talking early 70s.  How many times did you go there as a kid?  I've been to Disneyland  probably 25 times. 
[00:41:30]  Ugh, what a queer.  Well, I used to live out there  when I was a kid.  I agree with Jimmy.  We're shock jocks.  I was a kid out there.  We're shock jocks.  You can't be admitting that you went to Disney.  Dude, you went on field trips to Disney  in school when you lived out.  I lived in the O.C.  You know what?  I went once.  Me too.  I went once and said,  this stinks,  this is overrated,  and I'll never come back.  When was the last time you were at Disney?  Tell him. 
[00:42:00]  Tell him.  Tell Jimmy.  Tell him.  I went to Disney World in Florida  under a year ago.  He goes all the time.  It's nice.  It's not just the Magic Kingdom, my friend.  It is Epcot.  It is the water parks.  It's wonderful.  Anthony's trying to relive his childhood.  I enjoy Disney.  He's got that pesky babysitter.  He missed out on a normal childhood,  so he's trying to recapture it at Disney.  Epcot has all the lands.  You can go to Japan and Mexico, 
[00:42:30]  and then you have dinner there,  and you see their little attraction.  It tells you a little bit about, like, Norway,  and you go in,  and you take this little ride,  and it'll tell you, you know,  Norway is known for its fishing.  And you're sitting in a boat,  and you go, ooh,  and they got a guy,  a little robot guy,  and he's fishing.  Is he?  Here's what you do when he goes to Stone for Fishing.  Is it, ugh,  next stupid country?  No, and then you go to another country. 
[00:43:00]  I bet you Anthony has a big smile on his face,  maybe a couple tears,  because he's just so emotional.  I'm so happy.  He gets into it.  And you go to the little England part of Epcot,  and you can have yourself some beer.  You sit there and drink.  You could do a little drinking game.  No beer, though.  No, that at Epcot, you can drink.  And a fun thing to play is the drinking game,  where you try to go from England all the way to Mexico  and drink at every single country. 
[00:43:30]  See, now that's cool.  And you are hammered by the time you make it to, like, Africa.  You're done.  Yeah.  You're done.  That's right.  That's a fun game to play.  Yeah, it sounds terrific.  If I want to cry, I'll watch Brian's song,  and then look on the net about these other stupid third-world dumps.  It's fun.  It's not fun.  So where were we?  We were talking about the deaths,  some of the deaths and how they hose it down.  The Columbia would come in,  and it's on a track because, perish the thought,  anything works independently there at Disney. 
[00:44:00]  So it's on a track, but it actually has a motor.  So somebody has to work the speed,  but they don't have to steer the ship.  When it comes in to dock,  somebody's got to, like, cut back on the engine,  and a couple of workers take the big ropes,  throw it around the cleats, and the boat stops.  Well, they were going a little too fast.  I think someone was kind of new.  And there was a poor Asian couple,  probably spent every yen that they had to get from Japan to America to go to Disney.  What was this, by the way?  When was this?  This was about four years, five years ago. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  And the boat came in.  They threw the rope on the cleat.  These Asian people are waiting on line.  The cleat rips out of the dock,  because the boat's going too fast,  and whips the guy in the head.  He's hit with a spring-loaded rope cleat from a ship,  and it just takes his head clean off.  Took his head clean off.  Decapitated him?  Decapitated.  You sure he got decapitated? 
[00:45:00]  I don't remember that part of it.  Yeah, took his head right off.  Yeah, all right.  Was his wife upset?  A little bit upset.  A little bit.  Imagine you're on line for a ride,  and the next thing you know,  your spouse's skull is in front of you.  You know what they do, though?  They give you a...  Put ears on it?  They put...  I believe they let her go to the front of any line she wanted to.  Space Mountain, right to the front, Mrs. Wang.  Your husband's head.  I'm sure they mailed her a VIP pass.  They'll be waiting for you at the exit gate. 
[00:45:30]  You see, very few people on the clock actually have the little gold wristband.  That means a spouse or a loved one has been decapitated,  and then there's the asterisk,  while in line.  Yes.  But again...  No more lines for you.  They just hose it down and start it back up again.  How does she not own Disney World?  They have some lawyers.  This is what it is.  They must pay a fortune when people get injured there.  It all depends on where you're from.  There's a lot of...  Vietnam, 200 bucks.  Yeah.  A lot of money there.  There's a lot of rumors there, too, though. 
[00:46:00]  They say nobody's ever been pronounced dead at Disney  because they won't allow it.  Well, they dragged the body off-site.  They dragged the body off-site so that no one can actually be pronounced dead at Disney.  How great is that?  But that's a rumor.  You think they have, like, Mickey Mouse and Goofy just dragging the bodies off-site?  Let's pull them off of here.  Okay, you grab the arms.  I'll grab the head.  They'll turn them upside down.  There's spinal fluid leaking all over the floor.  Get the hose. 
[00:46:30]  And the wacky, like, Keystone Cop version of the fire department comes over and sprays the blood down.  Oh, they can't control the hose.  People are laughing.  The electrical parade comes through and blood on the tire tracks.  Wow.  It's wonderful.  I love Disney.  It's a magical place.  And then the People Mover was another death.  They have a lot of high schools that would take their prom field trips there.  And a guy got a little overzealous in one of the cars, wanted to be with some of his friends. 
[00:47:00]  And the People Mover moves at about one half a mile an hour.  It's the slowest ride ever.  What it is is a ride you go on when the lines are too long for everything else in Tomorrowland because it kind of takes you through the other rides.  So you get a glimpse of what's going on in the other rides.  So he was alone in one of the cars and wanted to get with one of his friends.  Sure.  And they're like pods on these electric tracks.  And as he's climbing over, he fell between the two cars.  And, of course, the Disney death, he was crushed because a lot of crushing deaths at Disney. 
[00:47:30]  It's never like, what happened here?  You never have time to really go, I think I'm injured and I'm going to die.  It's a very instant, fun, happiest place on earth, crushing death.  You get it, Disney.  A lot of hair, picking hair out of machinery.  People are saying that that guy wasn't decapitated.  You can read it on Snopes.com.  You can read about Disney deaths at Snopes.com. 
[00:48:00]  I heard when that cleat hit him in the head that his head came off.  That's my information, my friend.  Either way, he was in bad shape.  Yeah, please.  B-Bear from Boston.  I bet Anthony keeps a little notebook while at Epcot, writing down pertinent facts about each country.  Yeah.  I did know Canada.  What year was that?  They do have all year.  And a lot of people want to know how long you spent at Nazi Germany while in Epcot.  Exactly.  We're closing the park, sir.  I just want to try on one more uniform, sir. 
[00:48:30]  Sir.  They do have Germany.  They do have the German pavilion, Germany pavilion at Epcot.  But they really steer clear of the roaring 40s.  The late 30s and 40s really aren't represented at Disney like they should be.  They go from 1939 to 1950.  It's like 1933.  Right.  And then they go up to about the 50s.  Yeah.  In Germany.  And they're skipping anything involving the war years. 
[00:49:00]  They had to ask Anthony to leave Poland because he kept trying to shoo everybody out of it.  Trying to start up a little ghetto.  Could you eat your knock worse in here, please?  Why?  No, no, no.  Just come with me.  It's okay.  They do a wonderful Oktoberfest thing at the German pavilion.  Do they?  Every day?  Germany stinks.  They spell Oktober with a K.  It's a creepy place.  It's fun.  It's frightening and intimidating to people to have a K.  It's Oktober every day in Disney.  It's Oktoberfest like that.  Wonderful.  And then every night at Epcot, the fireworks display and the big globe that comes out. 
[00:49:30]  It's a wonderful, wonderful, happy place.  I went once with a girl when I was maybe 21 or whatever.  My girlfriend at the time wanted to go and I met her and her father down there.  Now where?  At Disney World?  Florida.  Okay.  I ran off to Airlines and stupid whore.  She lost my Lakers jersey.  She's like, I don't know what happened to it.  She took it to the pool and left it there.  She probably slept with somebody.  She cheated on me a lot.  Dirty girl.  Some Mexican probably left two generations all over my stupid Lakers jersey. 
[00:50:00]  That's when you were dressing ghetto, right?  No, no, no, no.  This is when I was a freshman.  No, that was when I was a freshman.  You weren't a Lakers fan, were you?  Yes.  I loved James Worthy.  He got busted with a hooker in Seattle.  I loved the old ones.  Of course you'd love him then.  Worthy was amazing.  Of course.  Speaking of my white black guy days, I had a memory last night and I got oof.  Can we tease that?  Because we're really late.  I do chills.  We're really late.  We are just three very different people.  I enjoy things like that and you enjoy, you know, hookers and things like that. 
[00:50:30]  You enjoy Disney.  I enjoy hookers.  Do you think we're different?  Because you're picking more polar opposite things.  I love God and wholesome things.  Well, you know, you kill children and you like prostitutes.  Jeremy, really fast because we've got to take a break here.  Just so you know, there's a book called Tragic Kingdom.  Details, all that stuff Anthony's talking about, plus the pedophile cover-ups.  Really?  Oh, really?  A little ped cover-ups.  And it's called Tragic Kingdom?  Tragic Kingdom.  Sounds like a good read.  Yeah, there was a drowning, too, of a couple of kids that tried to swim from Tom Sawyer Island. 
[00:51:00]  They hung out, waited until the park closed, hiding, and then they tried to swim to Tom Sawyer Island across Little Thing,  and I guess they were drunk and one of them drowned.  Wow.  I remember one time Otto and George, who was great yesterday, was doing something.  It was right after those two kids were killed when they went inside the polar bear cage.  Oh, yeah.  Otto's on stage.  I think I just blew the joke, but I didn't care because at the time,  and the puppet, he goes, I like your outfit, George.  Yeah, I found these clothes outside the polar bear cage, 
[00:51:30]  which would have been much funnier if I didn't say polar bear cage.  But I had to make a time reference because back then, everybody got it.  If I just would have said that, you would have went, when did that happen?  Yeah, when did that happen?  I probably should have.  Otto had one of the greatest lines yesterday.  Can you redo it, please?  Otto and George were on the show yesterday,  and after we ended this part of the show, of course, we continue on XM,  and we do the walk to the XM studio live on the air for XM, right?  And we just mock people on the street.  And unfortunately for us and this woman, we saw a woman with one arm. 
[00:52:00]  She had a half, she had like one arm,  and then the other arm was like stopped like maybe three inches below the elbow.  Yeah, and she had a stump just kind of hanging out under a short-sleeved little blouse.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was above the elbow.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  We're hanging out outside this place, outside of XM,  because Ope is obsessed with just making fun of her to her face,  and we're like, look, let's just go in.  This could be a problem.  And when she came out with the little stump arm,  Otto went, how'd she get that hailing a helicopter? 
[00:52:30]  Otto and George, bananas this weekend in New Jersey.  Yeah.  Yeah, Hasbrook Heights, bananas.  Friday and Saturday with Otto and George.  I laughed all night.  Really.  So did I, actually.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Bill Burr's here.  He'll join the program next.  Ooh.  Opie and Anthony, this ain't your mama's radio show.  Bitch.  Do you understand that nobody likes you?  By the way, we've been here a while now.  When we come out of commercials, I hate how they bring us back in. 
[00:53:00]  Why?  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings.  Free FM.  Yeah.  That's just for this station.  We got a faster rhythm on this program.  We need something else.  How about this?  Opie and Anthony Mornings, VFM.  No, it's that delivery.  Too cool for the room delivery?  But it's so slow.  That's right.  It takes forever.  I mean, you know, people sit through a lot of commercials and we got to get right back 
[00:53:30]  into it.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Tell Chernoff to change that immediately.  Wow.  Immediately.  Yes, just tell him.  How about ask?  How about suggest?  No, we tell him what to do.  Oh, boy.  No, don't get into that mindset there.  We're telling him.  Opie Stalin.  How about change that?  I was enjoying Anthony's little read for iMac during the break.  I love it.  Anthony loves his iMac.  I'm having a blast with the iMac. 
[00:54:00]  Cool.  Mine was on its way, I think.  The people from Apple gave me an iMac, and I'm a computer geek, and I love this thing.  And this isn't even the commercial or anything for it, but it's one of these computers that  is so easy to use, but they have so many features on there.  And, I mean, you plug your camcorder in, and where a lot of computers have got to find  which software you want to use or buy it even.  Everything's included in this thing.  The right program pops up. 
[00:54:30]  You get iMovies.  Boom.  You upload your video to your computer.  Boom.  It's there.  It's sectioned off.  It knows when you shut your camera off and turned it back on.  So all of those are sectioned off into things.  Now you're editing out all the crap.  How many people have sit there, you plug in your stupid movie, and try to get people  to watch it?  No one wants to watch it.  How many rolls of, like, things of tape you got laying around your house of vacations  that no one wants to see?  But you spice it up with music and cuts and stuff like that. 
[00:55:00]  And you can make some pretty cool presentations.  That sounds like fun.  It is a lot of fun.  You're into computers.  Rolls of tape.  I know.  How old are you?  They do have to.  What do you call?  Okay.  What do you watch?  A stag movie?  Right.  Your 8mm films?  It's got that nine-kid family and, like, the wooden cassettes of tape.  Cassettes.  8mm.  Big VHS cassettes.  No, it's the tiny...  I said 8mm.  8mm.  DV. 
[00:55:30]  It's digital video.  I would have said DV, but Jim would have thought it was some disease he has.  See, it's so old.  It's 8mm.  It's 8mm.  I'm such an ass.  Nah, digital.  Hey, let's say hi to Bill Burr.  He's in studio today helping us out.  Jimmy wants an iMac.  Jimmy does want an iMac.  Why would they send one?  Why would they?  Give one to Jimmy.  He's one of the most creative people I know.  Maybe you'll get an iMac for Jimmy Day.  Wouldn't that be good?  Are we promoting Jimmy Day yet?  Who knows?  I think so.  Are we promoting Jimmy Day?  Are we allowed to announce we're going to other cities yet? 
[00:56:00]  I think we are.  I'm signing DVDs.  All right.  We'll have promos soon on this fine station.  8 people show up.  And XM will be running the promos as well for Jimmy Day.  8 people show up.  That's what we're hoping.  Or Jimmy.  Oh, no.  That's what we're hoping.  I would cry.  I would actually cry for Jimmy.  I want Jimmy sitting there at a table with his DVDs all eager and 8 people show up.  Sign for the same guy four times.  Hey, welcome back.  Oh, he's just getting online. 
[00:56:30]  It brings back a memory.  When we were in Boston at AF and we put out our CD, for the most part, we had unbelievable signings.  We went to Springfield, the mall there, and we sat there for eight straight hours.  And there was a line all the way around the mall.  And when we were out in the suburbs, it was crazy, the signings we had.  But do you remember the signing we had at Tower Records?  It was Tower Records on Newberry Street.  Uh-oh.  We show up, right, and they have a table, and they have the banner set up, and they have  our CD covers, a poster, and Ant and I show up, and we see that there's a line of maybe 
[00:57:00]  10 people, and we're like, this is a little weird, because everywhere else, it's been lines  around the entire mall, and we had to camp out all day.  Huh?  I said, are they only letting in 10 at a time?  We're wondering, like, what the heck, man?  What's the deal?  Maybe they get a later crowd here.  Right, I mean, with these other signings, we sign so much, our wrists hurt.  Yeah.  So we get there, and we're sitting behind the table, and there's literally 10, maybe 20  people.  So now we're asking each person their life history, like, so, where do you live? 
[00:57:30]  Where do you work?  How long have you been listening to the show?  Where were you born?  Right.  When's your birthday?  Because we're trying to slow down the line so we don't look completely ridiculous.  We don't want it to get to a point where we're just sitting at a table waiting for  someone to walk up so we can sign their CD.  The spinal tap moment, man.  The spinal tap moment, where you're just sitting at the table.  We didn't do enough promoting.  We didn't do enough promoting.  Well, that is the key in these events, to promote them.  Yes.  And it's always good when you start a process, the 5th of May, and then you start announcing 
[00:58:00]  it from now.  Well, are you surprised?  No.  Are you?  No.  All right.  We got lots to do.  Well, women, women, a woman receives chin implant.  Yeah, I heard her on Wins on the Way, and oof.  She didn't have a chin for her whole life.  For her whole life, she had to have her chin removed when she was 5 or something like that.  I caught part of the story, but then I was just laughing so hard at her talking. 
[00:58:30]  She looked like Rocky Dennis.  It's like, that's your idea of an improvement?  Yeah.  They installed a new chin on her, but it looks like, you know, they gave her a...  Looks like the doctor didn't do well in art school.  Yeah.  Your donor, Mr. Do-Right, with a Mountie in Canada, gave his life.  She just had this giant chin.  Maybe she asked for the Jay Leno look.  I don't know.  Hey, you hear about this little woman with a chin?  That's crazy. 
[00:59:00]  I guess it was swollen.  I hope it was swollen.  But it's got to be not having a chin.  She was talking about how she had to have the chin.  It was a life-saving thing.  Yeah.  Because her tongue was starting to curl up and go into her throat.  Please tell me she's single.  No one married that.  No, she's married.  Who married that?  There's a picture of her in the paper, and, you know, her husband, all proud, is standing  next to her with her new chin.  How do you marry somebody, and believe me, I know I have a weak chin, but at least it's 
[00:59:30]  not a life-threatening ailment.  It's there.  You look for it.  You see it.  You pinch through a little fat, and you're like, oh, yeah, there's a nub of bone, a speck.  Could she eat soup?  How do you...  She's got to do a headstand and just kind of put it on her upper palate.  Here she is, so we could all openly laugh at her.  And is that...  Is that her?  Her hair is worse than her chin.  Is that her husband or her doctor?  It's the husband standing by her.  Wow.  After the operation, I guess. 
[01:00:00]  There it is.  Wow.  Please tell me...  Do we have a photo?  I want to be four.  Yeah, her chin looks like Play-Doh.  What did she look like beforehand?  Just like that, without the lower half of her head.  I want to see her whole dumb face collapsing.  Did you hear where they grew the chin, though?  In a closet by mushrooms?  They grew the...  Actually, the jawbone?  In her back.  In her back.  Where is the story?  Doctors are doing some creepy-ass stuff, man.  Maybe we should do some reading before we start the show. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, we just blurt stuff out.  She didn't have a chin.  How is it done?  I don't know.  They grew it in, like, her back or something.  We shouldn't...  No, it's creepy.  Wait, where is it now?  It is really creepy.  Bowling her back.  Where the heck is it?  Where is it?  Ah!  There it is.  You know why?  They needed...  They used a donor bone.  All right, here it is.  But they had to have her own marrow in the bone.  Here it is.  So it wouldn't reject it.  Here's the story really fast.  Denise with her husband, Richard, four weeks after a historic transplant of her jaw,  which was first implanted into her back to help nourish the body part. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  It was in her back on her lower back.  For how long?  How long does she have a chin on her back?  Ah, man.  I never repass the first paragraph, Jimmy.  How long?  What position do you put her in if you're the husband?  Either way, you'd have to look at her face with a chin on her back.  Hopefully, he has a foot fetish.  Or a flappy neck fetish.  Well, she's happy today.  She sneezes.  Her neck just moves for three minutes. 
[01:01:30]  She must have a sparkling personality, though.  No.  Because she never had a chin.  It was from five years old or something.  So he married her chinless.  It wasn't like he got married and all of a sudden she lost the chin.  Did he just go like, ugh, at the you may now kiss the bride part where she lifts the veil  and he just, no, we're going to leave that part out.  He goes to kiss her.  It's her Adam's apple.  He's like, oh, sorry.  You go right back to her throat.  When did he realize this is the best he's going to get?  He's not bad.  Well, he looks like a regular guy. 
[01:02:00]  He actually had to put his finger under her Adam's apple to lift her up and give her a nice little kiss.  You do that and you yank the back of her head.  Romantically, Anthony.  Right.  Not like in a bad way.  Yeah.  You kind of do the run through the hair with the fingers and then pull her chinless head toward you.  Then a little John Rambo.  You go to hold her face to tell her you love her and your fingers touch in the middle.  Please tell me we have a picture before the chin. 
[01:02:30]  Why are there never before pictures?  Like a woman transplant, face transplant.  You can never find a picture of her before.  Right.  Well, here's here's some audio.  Let's listen to the story.  A medical first at Mount Sinai Medical Center.  A woman born with a severe facial disfigurement now has a new jaw.  Doctors removed Denise Agelsky's jaw when she was just two years old.  That surgery left her unable to eat solid foods and dependent on a breathing tube.  Just recently, Denise began losing soft tissue, which collapsed her airway. 
[01:03:00]  She would begin choking while trying to sleep.  Now that the transplant is a success, Denise is ready to get on with life.  It has changed my life.  And I want to thank these guys.  They're miracle workers.  They really are.  This was the first total jaw transplant in the state of New York.  Wait a minute.  So you meet her.  She can't eat solid food.  She's breathing through a tube. 
[01:03:30]  What makes you go, I'd love a second date?  How does that happen?  This is the gal for me.  Throw a fish at old pelican face.  She's sucking down like she has to mush her vegetables up and suck them down with a straw.  Blech.  By the way, Dave.  How does that happen?  She's just like a sucker fish.  Just against a glass window.  Sucking stuff off of it.  Nourishment off of it.  You don't need to hire a maid.  Just put a stupid little sucky mouth on the back of the sofa. 
[01:04:00]  Let her clean it.  Blech.  You have to throw your food against the plate glass window.  The kids outside are tapping on the glass.  Mush her carrots up so she can suck it through a straw.  You're in a restaurant humiliated.  Your boss comes over.  This is your stupid hose face wife.  This is the girl I'm talking about.  Right.  Isn't she a doll?  That's what I told you about.  Yeah.  Mom, meet old straw gullet.  She is a one of a kind.  By the way, Dave and Phoenix, her Adam's apple, Jimmy. 
[01:04:30]  Not everyone dates like you do.  No, didn't Billy said that?  I'm not sagging what you said.  Okay.  All right.  So it is you, Jimmy.  So we're both faggots.  Adam's apple.  How awful.  And not only that, now she starts to snore.  You finally get to sleep to escape this jelly-faced monster.  You know, all right, you got to get this fixed.  Here, take a piece of my knee, would you?  You hear her choke and you debate whether you're going to wake her up.  Maybe I should just let her die.  Yeah, I should just end this right now. 
[01:05:00]  Mouth to trachea.  Her gills.  And now she's got a 15-year-old boy's bones.  Another husband's got to think of that every time he's making out or looking down at her.  15-year-old boy bone.  Bill from Waterford, do you think people used to tell her, keep your back up?  And then keep your back up.  Not by the hair on my backy back back.  Oh, she got knocked out.  No, she had a glass back.  Got more backs than a Chinese phone book. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, God, I was ripping off Pat from Munaki.  I didn't even see that.  Yeah, Pat from Munaki.  She has more chin than a Chinese phone book.  That doesn't include the back part of the joke there, Pat.  You nine-toed sloth.  Let's say hi to Matt in Boston.  What's up, Matt?  Well, I have a question before Matt.  Yeah, hold on, Matt.  How does she wear a football helmet? 
[01:06:00]  Would she just suck up into her nose and teeth?  Her strap is under her nostrils.  Oh, 42.  We're just kidding.  By the way.  Under her upper jaw and then that tongue hooked around the strap.  When it's curling up.  Her curling tongue.  Can I just ask a pertinent question?  Thank you for explaining it.  Can I just ask a pertinent question?  Why would she be wearing a football helmet?  Oh, no.  Maybe because her husband just looks at her head and has to punch it.  Shut up, would you? 
[01:06:30]  All right, all righty.  She's got a jaw, but she sounds like quite the mush mouth.  When he married her, he had just dreams of circuses and then being in town to town.  Her being chinless straw lady and then making a mint.  Him counting money.  Didn't work out that way.  Let's say hi to Matt in Boston.  Matt.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning, Matt.  Weren't there two Muppets that they were aliens or something and you squeeze their nose  and they had no chins.  They would go.  Yeah, that's who she is.  She's one of those Sesame Street characters.  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. 
[01:07:00]  I forget what they would say.  I'm sure the morning zoos are taking a different approach on this story today.  Yeah, I don't think there was any domestic violence in their take.  No, not at all.  What do we do with it?  I love how the people on the Internet Movie Database changed the information.  The latest is at IMDb on a review of the page for Lucky Louie, the HBO series that Jimmy  is going to be in.  It says that Jimmy may not make it to season two because of his battle with AIDS. 
[01:07:30]  Somebody wrote that in and I guess they accepted it as fact.  Well, good luck with that battle, Jimmy.  Battle with AIDS.  Hey, we were asking for crying, like real people crying when they retire.  Yeah, sports guys retiring and just crying their eyes out.  I asked E-Rock for a few.  Mike Schmidt.  Yep, that was a good one.  Dick Vermeule.  Mark Messier was great.  We love making fun of the athletes when they cry when they retire. 
[01:08:00]  It's very difficult.  It's, you know, I've been with these people my whole life, my whole career.  And it's, uh, it's pretty hard to leave.  Get all emotional.  I really didn't want this to happen.  I really didn't.  You know, you try to be strong, but these people are your life.  One of the greatest, we didn't mention it yesterday, uh, George Steinbrenner when the 
[01:08:30]  Yankees won.  Oh, this was years ago.  He was going through a phase.  I think it was menopause or something.  Wasn't it the first World Series?  It was in July.  Yeah, it was like the beginning of their latest run.  Yeah, the latest dynasty that they had going for themselves for a while.  And, uh, yeah.  And we were laughing because you remember the old George, the turtleneck, just busting  everyone's balls and everything.  And then out came this doddering old fool crying. 
[01:09:00]  This is the best team in baseball.  And, you know, Joe just brought this team together and I'm speechless.  He looked like Corky.  From Life Goes On, he was ridiculous.  He went from being this tough, talky old gentleman to now he's walking around with this stupid  empty little bucket of no blueberries trying to find his way home in the loons.  I was looking at the loons.  That buffoon.  And before that, the only image I had was, you know, the Miller Lite commercials, I think, 
[01:09:30]  with Billy Martin and, you know, you're fired, Billy, again.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  You know, the tough guy.  And there he is just, and his mouth was moving all weird.  His chin and lip was shaking.  And Joe just pulled the team together.  And I can't tell you how proud of my boys I am.  George, you can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  His godfather should slap his fat face.  Do you think when the old lady with no chin was going to cry, they knew she was upset because 
[01:10:00]  her stomach would quiver?  Her back would quiver.  I should have said that.  Of course, why would you when you're calling back Tim and saying, well, there you go.  Trying to recapture a moment that's gone.  So we're looking for those moments.  And, you know, it takes the listeners to catch on, I think.  Because they sent us today, Rocky 3, crying scene after Mickey dies.  But that sent in by Factor.  We're looking for the, yeah, we're looking for real life crying. 
[01:10:30]  I've watched this so many times and still cannot understand what Sly is trying to convey here  through his tears.  It's Mickey, Mickey.  And then he's like, I don't know if you're a bitch about it.  He said, I can't believe I didn't know you were a Jew.  Goldberg.  He didn't even tell me it was Goldberg.  Yeah, wasn't that the big surprise where they had the big star David there on his little  sliding drawer?  Doesn't he yell Mo in the end?  But we got this today. 
[01:11:00]  Instead of real athletes crying, we...  Where's our athletes crying?  I don't know.  I asked for it yesterday.  We're still working on it.  What happened?  Where's the microphone?  So why wouldn't you just give me one or two?  These should be all over the web.  Why wouldn't you just give me the ones you have?  Because I was composing them all.  What do you have?  I have BJ Serhoff crying.  Uh-huh.  And we still haven't gotten the Mike Schmidt video yet.  We're still looking for it.  So you have one.  You have one.  Do you have any others?  Mike Schmidt is brutal.  How about Mark McGuire? 
[01:11:30]  No.  How about someone else?  Mark McGuire teared up.  All right, here's...  He qualifies.  Well, here's the famous scene from Rocky III.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  What?  What?  Maybe.  He sounds like Jaw Lady.  Oh, he got more to do. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, he got more to do.  What is this?  Oh, my God.  I've been rough.  Who cares?  They didn't even take him to the hospital.  He laid there and died in a smelly dressing room.  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That was horrible.  Mickey dies.  He grabs his heart.  And they bring him to the dressing room.  And he doesn't want to go to the hospital.  How about just get on the gurney, stupid.  I'm okay.  Who listens to an old man?  And they leave him there in some stinky locker room.  Yeah, talking to her with her big nostrils.  Come here, old man.  What a horrible crying scene that was. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  That was really a douchey, chilly thing, watching that.  I remember when Ricky Schroeder cried in The Champ.  I saw that in the movie.  It's one of the first memories I have in the movie theater.  And I didn't want to cry in front of my friends.  Did you cry?  Of course I did.  I had a little tear.  What did you do?  A little zilch.  What did you do in front of your friends?  Did they make fun of you?  I don't remember.  They were all probably crying, too.  A bunch of moist-faced little fellas.  Sad.  Staring straight ahead.  Yeah.  Your eyes wide open because you're trying to fight.  And it just pulls up under your eyes and drips.  Were you fanning your eyes? 
[01:13:30]  Don't cry.  No.  Dab.  You do the quick dab.  You don't want to swallow because it sounds like,  No.  Well, we're looking for a real-life crime,  but that'll do for today, okay?  That'll do.  That'll do.  It's not what we're looking for.  I know it's not what we're looking for.  Let's play B.J.  Serhoff.  We have that.  Yeah, don't we have that?  Well, E-Rock has decided, you know,  he'll wait to get all of them,  and then he'll give them to us.  Hey, that finger wasn't supposed to be held up 
[01:14:00]  at Opie's back like that.  If you're going to do it, do it to his face.  Ooh.  Ooh, wait a minute now.  I don't like the way Hawk is making his, like,  just shut your face eyes at Anthony for Anthony's little joke.  I was kidding.  I didn't even see you hold up any finger.  I was just...  Oh, it was a middle one?  Index.  Which one?  Index?  You got a problem with what he just said, Anthony?  Because I didn't even see that.  I was just selling you out like you didn't hold up anything,  but then he made an excuse.  No, I held up this.  He probably did flip you off.  And then when you pointed it out,  he gave the eye, like, the head shake,  like, just shut up, Guinea. 
[01:14:30]  I mean, that's what I'm thinking.  Oh, I know.  You see that face, right?  That he just gave you.  Oh, he just gave you that.  Oh, you pedophile.  What we're seeing right now  is that too big for his British hawk.  Right.  Why don't we take a break?  That's right.  Give him a good raping.  Bill Burr, are we promoting anything today?  Caroline's 15th through the 18th.  Very nice.  Yes, get Kirk in the Wrath of Khan.  All right, yeah, we can do that.  He was the most human  during Spock's little eulogy 
[01:15:00]  of all the people I've ever known.  He was the most human.  How about Roy Smalley?  Oh, Yankee.  That was a good one?  No, I'm just saying.  BJ Serhoff.  I don't know who that is.  Yeah, who was Milwaukee Brewer for years?  Huh?  He played for the Brewers for a long time.  Oh, okay.  Well, it's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We'll continue in just a bit here.  Unbelievable. 
[01:15:30]  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony show.  Jimmy's just annoyed behind the scenes today.  Jimmy is very, very cranky.  They may have heard that in Radio Land,  a little curse in the background.  Who knows?  Yeah, it's the O.P. and Anthony show,  the ONA virus spreading across America.  Will there be a press release at 8 a.m.?  I don't know.  Oh, is that a time there's supposed to be a press release?  Why?  We were supposed to have a press release yesterday at 8 a.m. 
[01:16:00]  They said to hold off, so I'm assuming it's today, right?  Yeah.  No one got back to us, so I'm assuming that it's on.  We can maybe announce some more cities for this stupid ONA virus.  Bill Burr in studio.  1-866-313-FREE is our phone number.  Let's say hi to a guy that has no name,  and he's calling from somewhere.  What's up, man?  Hi, sweetie.  Hey.  Why did you answer him?  Good morning, Anthony.  Good morning, Opie. 
[01:16:30]  Hi.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Take care.  Hi.  Do you guys read Newsday?  Newsday.  We don't read Newsday, really.  Yeah.  All right.  There's too many ads.  And we're from Long Island.  We should support our local paper,  but there's just too much freaking ads.  I want to know what's happening in Syosset.  I got you.  But there's an article on Arthur Cheyenne that is returning to WPIX-TV  and how it was unfair that CBS fired him. 
[01:17:00]  And something about how Cheyenne, 37, was fired after he replied  with a letter of obscenity to hecklers while he was trying to deliver  an on-air report about MetroCards on May 19, 2005.  What do you expect the media to do, dude?  It's such an incestuous, self-centered importance they have.  Why wouldn't they defend one of their own?  Of course they're going to defend one of their own.  We called you hecklers.  Hecklers.  Yeah, this is the deal.  I found it in Newsday. 
[01:17:30]  This Arthur Cheyenne story we'll talk about for a couple minutes here.  It made all the newspapers.  The only paper to mention us, Opie and Anthony, was the New York Times.  Well, they don't want to.  The New York Post didn't mention us.  The New York Daily News did not mention us.  And now I'm looking at Newsday.  They didn't mention us.  We're a big part of this Arthur Cheyenne story.  A huge part of the Arthur Cheyenne story.  We had this promotion, and it was called Assault on the Media.  We had our O&A Pest just showing up on live shots to promote the radio program. 
[01:18:00]  And Arthur Cheyenne was doing a report on MetroCards, I guess,  here in New York City for the subway.  And our own fan was behind Arthur Cheyenne holding up an Opie and Anthony sign.  And all he was doing was holding up a sign that said, what the hell did it say?  Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah, that's what it said.  But then somebody else walked up the subway stairs, saw Than holding the sign, 
[01:18:30]  and started cursing and holding up his middle finger to the camera, which annoyed Arthur to no end.  That person is now in jail on tax evasion charges and used to be a visitor to the very room we are sitting in now.  That's right.  Wow, they went Al Capone on him, huh?  Oh, yeah, they went Al Capone on him.  That's right.  And from what I hear, he's losing his mind in a prison.  By the way, a guy that used to kiss our ass on the street every time we saw him. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, Cabby.  Talking about crazy Cabby.  Used to kiss our ass all the time on the street.  And then, you know, he's a phony like the radio show.  He helps out.  Well, from what I hear, he's kissing a little ass now in prison.  There you go.  And that's the least of it.  This is the actual audio of Arthur Cheyenne.  This is what he did live on TV that got him fired.  Good morning, Sean.  This is apparently a very simple crime to commit.  All one has to do is buy multiple MetroCard, stand at the turnstile, and just continuously swipe people in all day. 
[01:19:30]  Police sources say these guys net a couple hundred dollars a day, and that's pure profit.  But it's costing the TA a great deal, about $16 million a year, and they're trying to put a stop to it.  What the f*** is your problem, man?  What's great about this, he was live.  Yeah.  But he was so annoyed, he didn't even wait for them to go to the tape.  He just turned around as soon as his live shot was over and just said, what the f*** is your problem, man?  Yeah, he was so upset.  Usually the reporter has to stand there sometimes for an awkwardly long time staring into the camera before the film starts. 
[01:20:00]  But he just went right from what he was saying to turning around and dropping the f-bomb.  And as soon as Stan said, Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite Radio in his just monotone delivery, Arthur Cheyenne raised his voice.  You could tell right there he was so annoyed.  Yeah, he was very mad.  He couldn't wait to turn around and curse Stan and Cabby out.  I just love how this.  Sorry, man.  I just love how that started off so regular. 
[01:20:30]  Like, this is the end of this guy's career and you have no idea.  He's just like, make sure you get flowers for your mother today.  It's a wonderful day out here.  Watching the Hindenburg come in looks all nice at first.  So this was a huge story in New York.  And, yes, he got fired.  And I guess the WB here in New York City picked him up.  He's back on TV.  So all the papers are talking about the story today.  And, of course, they leave us out of it.  Why shouldn't he have been fired, though?  Here's the bottom line.  Why shouldn't the media?  You want all these perks or these complete carte blanche to do and say whatever you want under the guise of reporting news that's unbiased. 
[01:21:00]  So why can't they expect their reporters to act a certain way?  And, look, if you can't handle the pressure, then, hey, stay out of people's faces on the streets, stupid asses.  Why should they be able to go wherever they want, put a microphone in your face, disrupt your life just to get the scoop, and you can't respond?  And when you respond emotionally to them, they get all, oh, well, we just want to ask you some questions.  They get all condescending.  And if you respond with a push on the camera, they really get pissed off at you. 
[01:21:30]  Right.  So this guy couldn't handle it.  None of them can handle it when it's back in their faces.  They're great at sticking a microphone in some victim's family's face, a rape victim or, you know, whatever the problem is.  But as soon as you smash them with something.  Tax evasion?  Yeah.  Any type of thing.  So here's the update on the story, okay, that we just played.  F-word shouldn't have spelled fired.  Oh.  It's being reported today in all the papers as they leave us out of the story for whatever reason.  They don't want to promote radio. 
[01:22:00]  An arbitrator has ruled TV reporter Arthur Cheyenne was wrongly fired by CBS Channel 2 for blurting out the F-word on live television last year.  The station should have handed Cheyenne a lesser penalty for lashing out at hecklers, who were called hecklers, in a live shot when he thought the cameras weren't rolling last May.  Wow, that's a year ago already?  And also, by the way, Newsday.com, you are mentioned.  Well, but not in the actual Newsday article.  The online version.  The online version.  Terrific.  Boy, how many people read newspapers online?  Could be 5 or 10. 
[01:22:30]  Perhaps more than that, Anthony.  I'm just glad this is over.  Behind me said Cheyenne 37, who has since bounced back with PIX Channel 11.  It never should have happened to begin with.  Cheyenne, who plans to stay at Channel 11, will get unspecified compensation.  Look at that.  Oh.  The arbitrator said CBS should have gone easy on Cheyenne because he never intended to curse on air, and the station did not receive any complaints.  I actually agree with that.  I do, too.  But, again, the guy cursed on TV, and he's a reporter. 
[01:23:00]  But he didn't mean to.  Too bad.  Well, we didn't mean to do the Sex with Sam thing, so we shouldn't have been fired either.  Yeah.  It was just bad judgment.  I actually agree with it, too.  I don't know why.  Poor judgment.  Company policy bars use of the F word but does not require offenders to be fired.  CBS, the arbitrator noted, tolerated hijinks from the likes of ratings giant Howard Stern, who has since moved to blah, blah, blah, which has no language restrictions.  A CBS representative was not immediately reachable for comment last night.  So that's the update on the story that's all over the place today. 
[01:23:30]  Do you know?  Wait a minute.  What happened?  You do know that Stern is not mentioned in the online version.  No, no, I'm not kidding.  You bet's funny, though.  It's amazing how biased the media is against this show.  Yeah.  And it's because we call them out and we tell them what scumbags they are.  Sorry.  You are.  Well, we're not going to play ball.  This is how it is.  If they're not going to mention us because they can't take it, then fine.  Babies.  It's just ridiculous, though. 
[01:24:00]  We were the story.  And they now call us hecklers or some radio show or I don't know.  But the New York Times got it right.  They had all the details, including what radio show it was, what the sign was, all that crap.  That's all right.  Anyone that reads the story, they'll remember.  But the problem is, who reads the New York Times?  It's too many words, and most of the words are big ones.  And the paper is so big.  They've got a great sports section, though.  Yeah.  If you could find it.  And you have to be one of those business guys.  I don't think your newspaper should weigh five pounds. 
[01:24:30]  Who reads Lifestyles?  On a Monday, right?  Yeah, on a Monday, your newspaper weighs five pounds.  That's one of those business guys on the train, and you have to learn how to fold it properly.  It's not a paper you can just open up and read.  You've got to, like, fold it and then refold it and look at a little panel at a time.  A newspaper shouldn't take over three seats while you try to read it.  Yeah.  You know?  The Wall Street Journal, it makes the Times look like a comic book.  You ever look at that crap?  Even the front page is boring.  It's like another language.  Oh, Enron execs say, oh, shut up. 
[01:25:00]  Who cares?  I know, it's like from, like, the 1800s.  Yeah.  World comp stock to plummet.  Yeah, they don't even have photographs.  It's like stipple-drawn pictures of the people.  A what?  What?  Stipple.  It's a drawing technique, which is just dots.  Just like, um...  Yeah, I was thinking that, too.  Never heard of that?  No, no one under the 95 has ever heard of that.  A stipple drawing?  Yeah. 
[01:25:30]  Where'd you learn that?  Uh, actually, some girl I knew.  She used to draw like that.  What, did she identify you in a lineup?  Did she have a chin?  I would have just said it was...  No, she didn't identify me in a lineup.  You got tricky out of me, guys, on TV again!  Enough!  Swab your blowhole, cancer boy.  I think that's actually cool, that hole in the neck.  No, it is awful.  It looks familiar.  I'll just tell you that.  Why did you put the bib on?  So you don't have to stare into it at work or at lunch. 
[01:26:00]  It looks like he's going to rob a bank.  He puts a bib over it.  And how did that happen?  Well, I wonder.  Smoking?  Smoking.  So wait a minute, that's like bad for you?  That's what we said yesterday.  If you don't know smoking is bad for you at this point, then just continue.  Unless that Chesterfield cigarette satisfies your T-zone, taste, and throat.  But it's on TV again.  Wonderful.  It does look familiar, doesn't it?  That blowhole?  Like, they fashioned it into something that looks like, you know, something men are usually 
[01:26:30]  attracted to.  Well, they did.  I've never seen one that graphically before, this commercial.  Where the guy, it's a close-up, and he's swabbing it with a cotton swab, a Q-tip.  All right.  That would just be a hole.  And there's supposed to be a brass ring or something that they stick in there, kind of  pretty it up.  Yeah, maybe decorate it.  Decorate it up.  Wouldn't you put some lipstick around it? 
[01:27:00]  Absolutely.  A couple legs.  A tat?  Yeah.  Turn it into something?  Let's go to Jeremy in Tennessee.  Jeremy.  Opie.  Yeah.  If the New York Times had something good to say about you all, you'd be kissing our  butts, dude.  Right you are.  Oh, my God, Jeremy.  It says calling out Opie on New York Times.  First of all, we gave them props because they were the only ones that actually mentioned  us in this story that's out today.  And couldn't you tell that we were just goofing?  No, I mean. 
[01:27:30]  No.  No, I take everything.  We were making jokes that the paper's really large, sir.  No, you wasn't.  I actually read the times from time to time.  Well, I don't read it.  No, you stupid caller.  I'd rather read the post because it's on a...  It's so hypocritical, you dork.  Oh.  Easy with the language, sir.  Did he hang up then after that?  I hope not after a farm like that.  We got you.  We didn't.  He realized that...  He's a bright guy.  That was the problem.  Yeah.  He realized how stupid he really was.  And that's the only thing he could come up with, that I'm a dork. 
[01:28:00]  Come on, man.  You didn't hear how that guy was speaking?  I like reading the New York Post because it's on a third grade level and the pictures are  nice and big and stuff.  But every once in a while, I will read some New York Times.  Sometimes they have...  Every once in a while.  Sometimes they have pretty girls in bikinis.  That's right.  Too in the post.  I like unbiased news.  I go to Fox.  You might take it seriously.  You know, he might call you a dork now.  They are biased, Jim.  Hey, can't get enough of Andrea Day, one of these stupid reporters here in New York City. 
[01:28:30]  She's looking out for us, guys.  She's looking out for us.  She usually has the trench coat on because she's getting things done.  She's like a...  She's an investigative reporter.  Investigative reporter.  Dumb broad.  She stinks.  She's the worst.  One of the worst reporters I've ever seen on TV here in New York City.  She's on local Fox here in New York.  What's she trying to do?  Well, this interview you guys.  Huh?  Did she interview you guys?  Yeah.  A while ago. 
[01:29:00]  And she was trying to get stuff out of us.  I'm like, will you turn off your mic?  We're not going to say anything stupid.  That's all she's about.  Just keeping the mic on and making believe, hey, we're just hanging, right?  As the mic's in your face.  Yeah.  No.  We know what you're trying to do.  We're saying nothing.  What's she doing now?  She's giving a lot of promotion to this 9-11 video game.  Oh, another video game.  But it's under the guise that she's bringing it to our attention because it's so bad and  that someone has to speak out. 
[01:29:30]  Someone has to speak out.  The reality is it's an awful video game about 9-11.  You try to prevent the towers from being hit and being knocked down.  But first of all, it's an awful video game.  It's Missile Command.  That's how old this game is.  The old platform is based on Missile Command.  It's so primitive that it's never going to take off.  It's one of these dumb little things that someone out there did to get a little attention.  And if she never mentioned it on TV, no one would even know about the dumb thing.  Plus, you can't win it. 
[01:30:00]  No.  There's no winning.  There's no winning it.  Oh, it's like war games.  Right.  Then I figure it out.  You cannot win.  Tic-tac-toe.  That creep talks as he types.  Joshua.  Hello.  Joshua.  Just write it.  So here's the story.  And Andrea Day, she's just getting things done.  Yeah.  A disturbing new video game is all the rage on the internet.  No, it's not all the rage.  Save New York.  It absolutely is not all the rage.  Thank you, Anthony.  You're pointing it out now.  And more people will know about it because it's not all the rage. 
[01:30:30]  Someone, some intern pointed it out to you.  Right.  And you needed something to talk about today.  All the rage.  You needed something dramatic for your stupid news program.  The last time someone said all the rage, a sock hop followed us.  I didn't touch it yet.  The whole.  Oh, damn it.  You beat me.  I was right there.  It's all the rage.  A kissing contest.  It's all the rage.  Is it?  A disturbing new video game is all the rage on the internet.  The goal.  It's not.  We're on top of the internet. 
[01:31:00]  Have you heard about this game?  It's all the rage.  No.  Oh, man.  See, I don't know how.  Half-Life 2, Episode 1 comes out today.  That I know about.  Now, that's a game, my friend.  That's not all the rage.  It's all the rage.  No, no.  This is a 9-11 game.  I'm pre-downloaded.  This is all the rage.  This is all the rage.  The second I get home, I'm playing that.  Screw this game.  Yeah, a video game with primitive graphics.  Yeah.  It's primitive.  Believe me.  The graphics on this are 1988. 
[01:31:30]  Honestly, you have a stipple drawing a video.  Thank you, Jim.  Thank you, Jim.  Honestly, you would play this game for 30 seconds.  Not even.  It's kind of like, remember the Monica Lewinsky game with the sploods and the dress and all  that?  You played it for 30 seconds and went, that stinks.  It's worse than a dopey Flash animation game.  It's worse because it's just, the graphics are so primitive and the gameplay is so boring.  But here's the news because they have to, you know, they have to get dramatic. 
[01:32:00]  It's all the rage.  And they have to make it bigger than it really is.  So they make it sound like it's an unbelievable game with unbelievable graphics and all that.  Here's their story on it.  A disturbing new video game is all the rage on the internet.  The goal, save New York from a 9-11 style terror attack.  But for many, this all too real game goes way beyond disturbing.  Fox 5's Andrea Day has the story.  Here she is.  Listen to her.  My dad was a man of honor and this is putting such a bad name to it.  It was almost too much for Norma Jean Margiotta to take. 
[01:32:30]  The 18-year-old lost her father, a lieutenant with the New York City Fire Department on 9-11.  And she says this game brought it all rushing back.  You see the planes crashing into the towers and then the tower's full after a couple of planes hit it.  It's horrible.  She stumbled into it on a popular website we're not going to mention and reached out to Fox 5 right away.  It's all offensive.  It's offensive to me.  It's offensive to my family.  The game is called New York Defender, where you can use your mouse to fight back. 
[01:33:00]  Norma Jean just calls it heartless and insulting to her dad who gave his life on 9-11.  And the one person she wishes could see her graduate on Thursday.  I'm doing it for my dad and I'm doing it to tell those people that it's wrong.  It's not fair what they're doing.  And we spoke with the people who run the website.  They say it's their most popular game and even though it's in bad taste, they're keeping it up and running.  And now a lot of people are going to search and find it thanks to Fox 5 here in New York. 
[01:33:30]  You could see the girl being upset, you know, her father dies.  But the news should have said, you know, all right, we understand that, but we really, you know, I think the best thing to do is not to mention it.  Right.  And they're, oh, I almost cursed.  They're BSing everybody.  You think this girl called Fox?  Or do you think Fox discovered this game and said, well, now we have to make a story out of it.  Let's find a family member.  We've got to make it as dramatic as possible.  Let's find a family member, possibly a teenager that would be on the Internet and would happen to stumble across this. 
[01:34:00]  They wrote their own story there.  I will bet so much money this teenager did not call Fox.  That's how they do it.  They needed an angle.  So they're like, oh, she called us.  And someone is saying that this game is out two months after 9-11 happened and that they're about five years late on the story.  And it's not newsworthy.  I mean, some scumbag made a game like that.  It's in poor taste, but it's not newsworthy.  It's not dangerous.  It's just dominant poor taste.  There's nothing newsworthy about some pig making a video game like that. 
[01:34:30]  And you just gave them attention.  So do we.  But we'll at least acknowledge we gave these guys attention by talking about it.  We're attacking.  But they were trying to say, you know, they're trying to, you know, get something done and get it.  Yeah.  Well, you did nothing but expose it to more people today.  Did she have her trench coat on?  Not in that story.  No.  Hi, Jeff.  She gets really dangerous when she wears her sunglasses and her trench coat.  Under cover.  She's the worst.  And she's one of them that will run after you with the microphone. 
[01:35:00]  She's awful.  Wouldn't mind banging her, though.  She looked good when she was in here.  Push her face into the buttons.  Bend her the little console.  Teach her a lesson.  Teach her a lesson about weight loss eventually.  All right, we'll take a break and continue.  Wait, before we do, I have to acknowledge that there's an intern in here who wrote his name, Jeff,  and he left a big space between the E and the first name.  Yeah, what happened there?  G.  Why would the mic be on?  He forgot his name halfway through writing it.  Jerry?  Jerry?  Jerry, yeah. 
[01:35:30]  Jerry.  Steve wrote it.  Joe.  What?  Steve wrote it.  Steve wrote it.  All righty.  Hey, he's good.  Right off the bat, he's learning very well.  Absolutely.  You just pin the blame on someone else.  Hey, Steve wrote it.  What do I know?  Shouldn't he be mushing potatoes into a Wyoming mountainscape?  That's a bit of a stretch.  I get the reference, but.  I couldn't think of another bearded ass.  VH1 does a movie about the Unabomber.  He'll play him in like his teen years. 
[01:36:00]  Young Unabomber.  All right, when we get back, we're going to do the Mets thing.  And also, we got a highlight from Lizardman from yesterday.  He continued on our XM show.  Yeah.  We got the audio of the dart hitting the, it looked like the press plate.  That guy, I don't know what's going on there.  I couldn't watch anything he was doing.  No more of Kenny running out.  He's got to be in here for this stuff.  It's too disturbing.  He gets too grossed out.  Yeah, we'll talk about that as well.  I'm afraid.  Hey, it's 8 a.m.  Where's the press release? 
[01:36:30]  Got to be in here soon, right?  Let's find out if we got a press release.  On its way?  To read after the break.  It's the O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Opie, the Bone Crusher, Hughes, plus Anthony, the Hitman, Kumia, equals Party City.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, all right.  Sounds good.  Nice.  Yeah, home alone.  You're among friends with me.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:37:00]  Bill Burr sitting in with us today.  Playing Caroline's...  15th through the 18th.  Thank you, Bill Burr.  June 15th through the 18th at Caroline's here in New York City.  Why is he sitting there?  He's pretty creepy.  And staring at you, by the way.  Why are you sitting in...  My back is to him.  Why are you sitting there?  In the guest seat.  It's our creepy new interview.  Yeah, that's like the guest seat with his big name right in the middle of his shirt.  Yeah.  He didn't put it up where you usually wear a name tag over your heart or somewhere.  It's right in the middle of his belly. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  And it says J-E space F-F.  Great place for a fist.  Yeah.  The thing is huge.  Where should I put it?  You should talk into a mic that's on.  I don't know.  It should be like up here.  Yeah, up by, you know, where you usually have a name tag.  That's like where, you know, you come into Ellis Island and they would slap that on there.  Hey, this guinea's got rickets.  Put him in quarantine.  Oh, that's another one.  Okay, Bob Ross.  Yeah.  Got a little Bob Ross in. 
[01:38:00]  The young Bob Ross.  Yeah.  Let's put a little happy tree in there.  Gonna paint a big Jeff on my chest over here.  Where are you from, Jeff?  South Jersey.  Sounds good.  Can we hear more of your Bob Ross?  Yeah, that was really good.  Sorry.  No, it was good.  It was actually good.  Bill, right?  Oh, yeah.  It was good.  Let's hear a little more of that.  Let's get a little happy tree in there.  Let's give it a nice azure sky.  Throw some happy little bushes in there.  Let's get that talent. 
[01:38:30]  That's good.  That's terrific.  I really enjoy the dry mouth during the impression.  Yeah.  Where do you hear the...  The I'm not nervous.  I haven't had water in like...  Three years.  All right.  Beat it, stupid.  We're done with that.  You want a water, dude?  All right.  What are you...  He's probably leaving now going, look, that went all right.  I think I'm going to be a regular on the show.  What did they tell you you're doing?  Did they give you any duties? 
[01:39:00]  You had to ask him back.  Just what?  Just running around.  Just running around.  So that...  Look, even...  Oh, everyone's laughing at him.  Do this, Jeff.  Do this.  Yuck mouth.  Look at the paced mouth.  Yeah, so he's nervous.  You think?  You sway glow in the morning.  Actually, yeah.  Oh.  Actually.  Actually.  Actually.  Nervous.  Actually.  I'm...  I'm an intern.  Do you want a radio career?  Uh, maybe.  Maybe? 
[01:39:30]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  You should pull the mic closer to yourself.  What do radio...  What do you do interning for a radio station if you maybe want to be in radio?  Uh, it seems like a good job.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Seems like a good job.  So, Mike Savage, I mean, what exactly do you think you're going to wind up doing?  No.  No idea.  How old's the lower half of your face?  Uh, lower half?  23.  Anthony pointed out that he looked like a...  Oh, no.  Billy pointed out that he looks like a Clifford Peach. 
[01:40:00]  Grown up.  My bodyguard.  That was me.  It was Anthony.  Was it you?  Yeah.  Whoever it was.  He said...  It bombs when I said it, so I'll take responsibility.  It's a young Chris Makepeace from...  I said Chris Makepeace.  ...my bodyguard.  Boring.  No, that was a good movie.  Everyone knows the reference.  Boring.  It's because Bob Kelly looks like the fucking fat...  Oh.  Bob Kelly looks like the fat guy that beat up the bodyguard.  Hey, that's my bike.  That's Moody's bike.  Stupid cowboy boots. 
[01:40:30]  Guy's trying to jog with sweatpants and cowboy boots.  Towel around his neck.  All right.  You can beat it now.  Take care of it.  Thank you.  Cool.  This makes me long for E-Rock radio.  Ugh.  Stupid body.  Nothing's worse than E-Rock radio.  All right.  Let's...  Hey, Jeff.  Grab me a...  All right.  Here we go.  The Mets have a new theme song, and everyone hates it, and now there are death threats.  Excellent.  Why death threats?  It's a big story in the paper today.  I don't get that.  Met music strikes out with fans. 
[01:41:00]  It's not a rallying cry.  It's an outcry.  The new Mets theme song, Our Team, Our Time, is so bad the fans are petitioning online to  have it killed.  The creators are getting death threats, and it has been banned to only pregame playtime.  Well, the Mets...  Let me tell you what the Mets.  This is the corniest organization in sports.  Yeah.  You're cornballs.  Mr. Met, the big baseball head.  What the faggots?  You know what?  I'm a...  God, they're corny.  I'm a Mets fan, and I completely agree with you. 
[01:41:30]  We're finally going to get a new stadium in a couple of years.  Thank God.  Is it going to be pink?  I don't know.  Because the Mets are a chick's team.  I'm still going to have the apple, because it's the big apple.  The big apple.  God, what douches.  I was at the Mets game the other day.  I had a great time.  I was at the Mets Phillies, and I was looking for a Mets hat that I could actually walk  around and wear.  They still don't have a hat you could actually walk around and wear.  A manly hat.  You know, when I was in Boston, we did a live broadcast about a month, two months ago.  I almost bought a Red Sox hat, because they look cool. 
[01:42:00]  I got to admit, they look cool.  You can walk around in a Red Sox cap.  Not in New York.  And I almost picked one up, because I went to the Red Sox game, and I was outside Fenway,  and I was checking out the caps.  I'm like, look, they have like 10 styles that you can wear, and they look cool.  Do you have Boston underwear on, too?  I know.  You're just like, you're all Boston.  And it's New York.  You're in New York.  Show some respect for the town.  I respect, I hate Boston people that walk around New York with their goddamn bee hats 
[01:42:30]  on.  Get that 26th championship.  Stop crying.  You'll get another one.  Oh, because you step around with the Yankee hat up in Boston, and it doesn't matter if you're  in church, you'll get a Yankee suck chant.  Well, I mean.  Yankee suck.  Yankee.  Yeah.  Do they?  You guys are lazy.  Here's why.  No, it's because New York has a lot of things.  People don't really care as much.  In Boston, there's two things.  The Red Sox and racism.  Oh, as opposed to the open-minded people down here?  Attaboy.  I respect, Bill Burr, that he walks around Manhattan with a Red Sox cat.  He's got a Bruin shirt on. 
[01:43:00]  I respect that, though.  Jeez.  Well, why don't I dress up in this Sears catalog?  Do you have Paul Sox socks on?  Paul Tuckett.  Anthony did get his outfit from a Sears catalog today.  He smashed you good.  I just got it.  Oh, I got you.  Come on.  These are, I don't know what they are.  I said it before, and I'll continue saying it.  I don't buy my own clothes.  You are the worst-dressed millionaire I've ever seen.  Those are great clothes if you have a trapper keeper.  Bill Gates wouldn't wear that shirt.  Oh, man.  Dude, they're killing you.  Bill Gates would wear this shirt.  Bill Gates would not wear that shirt. 
[01:43:30]  Sorry, I can't be your age and dress like I'm in junior high.  Do you own anything?  Are you one of those people that you can't go to any friend's funerals because you don't  own a suit?  I don't know.  You show up with a B's hat on.  Hey, I love the guy.  He liked the socks.  Like it's important to wear a suit at a funeral.  Yeah, they're dead.  Who gives a shit?  Oh, Jesus, Opie.  I'm just saying.  I might dress like you.  Anthony, I never claimed to be a fashion play. 
[01:44:00]  Neither did I.  Okay, and I'm sorry.  There was a little dead air, and you decided to lash out at me.  I just wear clothes.  I came in here.  I said hello to you.  Yeah.  I have clothing that isn't always a goddamn T-shirt, and yes, I'm pointing you out,  Jimmy, also.  Sabra-cadabra.  I'd wear this proudly anywhere, anything.  Jimmy, you'd wear that to a funeral, right?  I certainly would.  This is what you wear.  Oh, we've got Miller.  Don't fall, meal ticket.  Don't fall until I get my apple.  Don't grab that light if you stop falling.  Fan, get behind him, please.  I love standing on swivel chairs. 
[01:44:30]  This is what you wear.  Look.  A Miller High Life T-shirt and ripped-up jeans.  Vintage, baby.  How much does that cost?  I don't know.  Probably like $100.  Yeah, probably $100 for a T-shirt.  It's a T-shirt that looks like it's 10 years old.  It's vintage.  That's the new gimmick.  And then I got my Holy Hole jeans.  Yeah.  I love those jeans.  It's the brand new old jeans.  It's called I Don't Give a Crap.  But you do give a crap.  You have to have thought about it.  Yeah, you have to.  Because you gave it some thought.  All right.  Why don't you help the meal ticket?  Whoa!  Anyway.  Meal tickets. 
[01:45:00]  So I was at Shea Stadium, and they still don't have any freaking caps you can walk around  and wear.  They have the worst colors in baseball.  Yeah.  Granted, How You Doing was an awful Yankee song, but the Mets have historically had just  dorky...  Meet the Mets.  I don't think that was an official sanction.  I'm not sure if it was, but it wouldn't surprise me if it was.  That was those two wops that decided to do it.  How you doing?  Well, the new song, Everyone's Hating, okay?  The article continues.  Fans of Pedro Martinez and the first place Amazons compare it to that Chicago Bear song, 
[01:45:30]  the Super Bowl Shuffle.  That could be the worst sports song ever, right?  I don't think there was one that was even worse than that.  Just the fact they call them the Amazons.  The Amazons.  They're amazing.  Oh, I get it.  They're G.  They're saying the new theme song is a bad ripoff of Run DMC circa 1985.  One fan even insinuated that Britney Spears' talentless hip-hop hubby, Kevin Federline,  could have done a better job with getting a song together. 
[01:46:00]  I think Kevin Federline is good, and I'm going to appreciate the jabs of that guy.  All right.  If I thought you were serious, I would punch you in the face.  He's great.  He is serious.  He is serious.  You know, when I was young and I would listen to rap music, I would, I would, uh, I used  to pretend that I was kind of like a rapper, but I would never, like, let people see me  do it, but I would kind of like, ugh.  Hey, you said you had some kind of dream or something last night.  It was a memory.  Oh, a memory of when he, because he used to be a wigger.  Jimmy was a wigger.  He would walk around, he wanted to fit in with the black community, and, uh, he was 
[01:46:30]  the whitest guy.  He was a wigger when being a wigger wasn't cool.  What's the matter?  No.  It's kind of taking off now.  Yeah.  The whole wigger movement.  Jimmy started it.  That's what I heard.  Yeah, Jimmy started it.  I would wear, like, my-  But the black people would beat him up.  Shelter.  Oh, no, they just rejected me outright.  They just felt bad for me.  Like, ugh, you dope.  Pathetic.  You stupid white kid with, like, glasses and almost mullets, but I cut the back thing.  You'd wear, like, a Kango hat.  Oh, yeah, constantly.  Constantly wear the Kango hat.  A furry Kango.  A furry Kango, and dress, like, with loose pants and everything. 
[01:47:00]  No, I don't think loose pants were in there.  High top fade mullet.  No, I just had, like, a bowl haircut.  I used to bobby pin my hair when it was wet from the front, so it would, like, be, like,  a bowl cut.  I was awful.  Oof.  Can you take-  I was maybe a minus one in high school.  There's one on my-  On my MySpace.  Nah, that one is tame.  I think you have better pictures.  What's my haircut look like?  I think you have better pictures of you, uh, as a wigger.  Not really, no.  I mean, I would wear my Shulteo Adidas.  And, uh, fat laces and, uh.  Yeah.  P-H-A-T. 
[01:47:30]  What, um, now, what did you remember during this phase?  Come on.  Um.  I love it.  You know how, like, uh, you, you-  This looks painful, doesn't it?  Oh, dude, it's awful.  He's wincing at the thought, not even of telling us, just the thought of it in his own head.  I know.  Think of the stuff he's admitted to.  I know.  And this is difficult to say.  I'd rather be wiping my chest off right now than talking about this.  Um.  But I had a memory of it.  Like, you know how, like, you, like, for me, when I fantasize, whether it's sexually or  otherwise, there has to be some kind of reality-based thing. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, that's a lot of people's fantasies.  It has to have a grounding, or it won't make sense.  So, like, when I would pretend I was a rapper, and the guy would say his name, if it kind  of sounded like my name, I would, like, feel comfortable doing it.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  There was a very popular rapper back in those days named Big Daddy Kane.  Sounds nothing like your name.  Well, Kane and James kind of sounded like-  Big Daddy James.  Oh.  Jimmy.  Oh, God. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, good Lord.  Oh, good Lord.  Oh, good Lord.  Oh, my face.  Hot.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, horrific.  As soon as I get home, the first thing I'm going to do is punch your mama in the mouth.  Hi, party people.  Wow.  That is really awful.  Dude, did you have your friends calling you that?  No, no, no.  I was just trying to pretend that was my name, and I would, like, sing along to the lyrics.  And you'd sing along alone? 
[01:49:00]  In the mirror?  Yeah, I would just kind of fantasize that I was, like, this famous rapper.  Doing gang signs and stuff?  No.  In the music?  No, I don't even think gang signs were popular back then.  Did you do any dancing, like, moves?  No.  You had to do some moves.  You know what?  My only dancing memory is I was drunk at my friend's party, and I thought I could, like,  kind of pop lock.  Did you even want to be white a little bit?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I was just, you know, it was back when it was rebellious.  Like, you know what I mean?  It was like that.  Oh, never rebellious.  But that's when it was considered rebellious. 
[01:49:30]  You know, it was a newer thing.  No, rebellious is bringing one home.  No, yeah.  As a boy, and showing my father, this is Leroy's father.  No, no, no.  It was, uh, it wasn't as popular back then, man.  It was really, the white community was nowhere.  It was really not loving it in 1984, like they are now.  Yeah.  It was, you know, it wasn't the in thing to do.  I was an ostracized douche as I should have been.  Wow.  Did you do the Monster Rain rap?  A lot of people want to know.  No, I didn't.  Monster Rain rap.  Dad, not only am I gay, he's black. 
[01:50:00]  Instant feedback's coming in.  This one just, big capital letters, douche killers.  Big daddy lame.  Big daddy lame.  Pennsylvania, Carolina.  Justin from Virginia.  Jimmy should have been shot like Tupac.  Oh, you're awful.  It really was bad.  That is embarrassing.  I told you I used to wear this hat.  I remember this big black kid, Orlando, took my hat. 
[01:50:30]  Like, he snicked.  Because I had really bad hair issues.  Like, I was very, it was a mortal terror that people would see my hair because I had cowlicks.  Oh, you had good hair.  Now I crew cut it, but cowlicks is why I would put the hats on.  That was to cover my hair.  Yeah.  That's really why it was.  I was almost thrown out of school for it.  And this big black kid took my hat off, just snatched it.  And I instinctively just snatched it back.  Oh.  And in the lunchroom.  He was a big dude.  I snatched it back.  And he was kind of surprised.  And he goes, oh, you want to fight me?  Oh, no.  I just wanted my hat.  And we started, like, we started walking towards, like, the thing. 
[01:51:00]  And I tried to get out of it with digging.  I'm like, if you want to see my hat, why don't you just ask?  Oh, as the walk to the fight area is going on, you're trying to get out of it?  Yeah, I did get out of it.  Because he said something and that was the end of it.  Like, I think.  You probably told a joke.  Why don't you just have a friend walk up and go, hey, get a load of FETSO over there.  Yeah.  And then you hit him.  Oh.  If you want to see my hat, just ask.  All right, listen.  We got to.  Oh, you faggot.  We have to take another break, but we got to finish up with this Mets thing. 
[01:51:30]  So they're saying that Federal Line would have done a better job.  As a Mets fan, I'm truly embarrassed by this horrible excuse for a song.  The Mets have anointed the song of 2006.  One writes, aside from the embarrassingly bad lyrics, cheesy, dated, vanilla ice style, music, and lack of melody,  it's stereotyping the team as tasteless, hipless, and classless.  It's just stupid.  It's really bad.  It's actually a perfect representation of that organization.  I'm sure the rest of America has not heard this.  So listen really quickly here. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  New York Mets, our team, our time.  New York Mets, our team, our time.  Our team, our time.  We got the hits, hits.  We score the run, run.  We shut you down, down.  We're number one, one, one.  New York Mets, our team, our time.  Someone should be fired for this, by the way.  Please.  You know, some white executive, you know, the kids are going to love this. 
[01:52:30]  It was put on his desk.  He listened to it and went, yeah, this would be great for the team.  Has no clue about hip hop.  Neither does whoever's rapping.  Big Daddy James would have done this right.  Big Daddy James.  Maybe it's his Big Daddy Kane.  Oh, Snoop douchey douche.  That was 10 cents.  He's at first base.  Cliff, Floyd, Connell's Beltran.  Playing the outfield.  Come to Shea Stadium.  Our team's the real deal.  New York Mets, our team, our time. 
[01:53:00]  New York Mets, our team, our time.  Our team, our time.  Wow.  This should be followed by the sound that De Niro made when he stabbed that guy in the  stomach in Godfather 2.  Our team, our time.  Antonio Ancelini.  That's just a white executive.  That's very, very out of touch.  Yeah, that guy thought it was going to bring the kids in.  They've never come up with a good song, though. 
[01:53:30]  Anytime, anybody.  Meet the Mets.  Joe DiMaggio.  Greet the Mets.  It is awful, but back then, at least, the whole country was a bunch of cornballs.  At least back then, it was like there was no relative comparison because it was all  corny.  All right.  With that, why don't we take a break?  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Do we read a press release next?  Do we?  Probably not.  I think so.  No, the word came down.  We will not be reading a press release, so the rumors will continue about Washington  and Columbus and other cities for the ONA virus. 
[01:54:00]  Maybe tomorrow we'll read something.  Maybe we won't.  Hey, you're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yep.  Okay.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Bill Barron Studio, 1-866-313-FREE.  Killing during the commercials.  I know.  I know.  We should just tape what's going on during the commercials and just run it, and then  we can sit around and laugh and laugh and laugh. 
[01:54:30]  I wanted Let's Go Mets Go to come back into.  Yeah, that was a good song.  When the Mets were cool.  Well, we were discussing Roger Clemens signing with the Astros, and basically we were talking  about how he'll never have as many wins as Cy Young.  Yeah.  Yeah, and then I mentioned and then I recapped that I had said that you only got four.  You started every fifth game back then.  Yeah.  But then, no, but then you said, yeah, that's right, you have more time to win games.  But then me and Ant were saying, yeah, but they only played day games. 
[01:55:00]  Then I brought up the fact that it doesn't matter that these legends these days are getting  ripped apart because no matter how good their stats were, these days, for some reason, everyone  jumps on and goes, well, the parks back then, you know, they didn't pitch as much, and they  only faced this many pitches.  The walls were shorter.  The guys that, back even 10 years ago, you never heard so much complaining about sports  legends and their records.  Now they rip them apart. 
[01:55:30]  Babe Ruth, well, yeah, he hit a lot.  But, you know, the guy played, like, twice a day for, uh...  But he never faced black pitchers.  Yeah, never faced black pitchers.  Never faced any of those Cuban pitchers.  So he was able to leave the game with his wallet.  What does that have to do with baseball?  Yeah, he didn't have to face relievers and stuff.  They didn't have relievers back then.  Yeah, no relievers.  So the pitcher got tired by the end of the game, and he had to continue to pitch, so his  curveball wasn't as good and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  That was true.  And there was no whirlpool therapy.  Yeah, but look at me, Ruth.  Look at the guy.  Big fatty. 
[01:56:00]  Also a great pitcher.  Fatty.  Are you going to try the line that killed during the break?  No, no, I wasn't going to do that.  I was smart enough not to do that.  Yeah, but it got a big laugh for four people.  You should try for a laugh in front of a lot of millions.  I can't do it now with that kind of setup.  Yeah, I know.  Are you going to attempt that surprise that isn't surprising now?  Don't do it, man.  It's suicide.  Come on, man.  Do it.  Do it.  Babe Ruth was like the ringer in a softball game.  That guy in a warehouse.  Yeah.  Ah, Jim.  That is funny stuff, Jim. 
[01:56:30]  I tell you, he's just quick, and I'm just off today.  So we were talking about that.  Blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  All right.  Everyone's got to rip the legends down.  Barry Bonds.  And that was Bill's line, by the way.  Everyone's got to rip legends down.  I said that before.  Are you saying that because it didn't get big enough?  You were hoping?  No, no, no.  I was, shut up, you.  Shut up, you stupid head.  Hey, whoa, man.  My people weren't even allowed into baseball until the 50s. 
[01:57:00]  Thank God for Jackie and Larry.  That's what Big Daddy James says.  You're both Big Daddy James.  I like Barry Bonds.  You like Barry?  I hope he hits a thousand home runs.  I don't really like him.  Dude, there's so many people who don't even care.  That's just like the whole thing.  They're like, this is all the rage.  People are outraged that he is in second place.  No, they're not.  No one cares.  You're right.  No one cares.  No one really cares.  Hit a thousand.  I hope he goes up there as one big chest muscle with like a bat just sticking out.  This is because it annoys nerds.  Records are for nerds. 
[01:57:30]  No one cares.  I think steroids should be allowed, to be honest with you.  Who cares?  If you want to sneeze and have your brains rattle around like tapioca pudding when you're  50, that's your business.  I want home runs.  And if people don't like it, they won't go to the games.  People want to see him smashed out of the park.  And then they're acting like all these guys who originally played were these virtuous people  who never would have done steroids.  They didn't exist.  Mickey Mantle drank like a 12-pack between like a doubleheader.  That was his version of steroids.  Yeah, he's going to juice up.  Imagine taking drugs out of rock and roll. 
[01:58:00]  Where would we be today?  Alternative rock.  Look how great Aerosmith was.  Right.  Off the drugs.  They were just completely wasted.  They're good now, though.  They were pink.  They seen all these like Rolling Stones.  The Beatles did their best stuff under the influence.  Oh, yeah.  You take drugs out of rock and roll.  Ugh.  The Beatles were in sync before they did acid.  Ooh.  Wow.  Wasn't going to let you.  I was hoping you meant like in sync.  I was hoping you meant like as a description of their actual playing. 
[01:58:30]  I didn't know you meant the band.  The band.  I agree with Jimmy, though.  Whatever it takes.  Yeah, who cares?  Let them do it.  Who cares?  I want to see them make home runs.  I talk like a sports guy.  We don't have to live with them after their careers are over.  Exactly.  When their bones ache.  Remember Lyle Alzado?  Exactly.  Oof.  There's a mess.  Achoo!  Oh.  Old pudding head.  All right.  We got some audio of...  What?  Just my achoo.  Oh, yeah.  Got a zero.  I like that, though. 
[01:59:00]  Thanks, Dan.  Good point.  Because it was rattling, but you referenced it before, so...  All right.  And there was someone out there that enjoyed it.  Brett Boone crying.  Here's our first one.  Thank God.  We finally got a real crier.  We want to start playing more of these, okay?  Sports guys retiring and crying.  Brett Boone made a tearful exit from the Seattle Mariners, who cut the three-time All-Star  after a half a season of struggles.  Pretty sad day, Corbin. 
[01:59:30]  You know, I've gone through a lot in this city, and a lot of great times, and we've scuffled  a lot last year to have.  I feel like a baby, but the city's been so great to me, and I've had a lot of success  here. 
[02:00:00]  There were some great guys, great people just around, and the fans have always been, you  know, awesome, great times, but tough times, and you guys have been good to me, and I appreciate  that.  You can act like a man!  What's the matter with you?  I got to get that picture, Godfather.  It'll put me back up top.  Oh, Brett Boone, who stars a new war picture. 
[02:00:30]  It's called take the hill, faggot.  You hit a ball with a stick.  I thought you were curing brain cancer.  Wow, he really said everything that we were goofing on.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, the fans, and this team, and they, they, just, you know, working together with  all these guys, and just, it's the best part of my life.  I can't put it on my glove and throw it around the horn anymore.  The horn.  Why don't you shut up?  The horn.  And he's got to talk about, you know, he's got to... 
[02:01:00]  I never thought this day was going to come.  I guess it happens to everybody.  He's got to acknowledge it, too.  He's got to cry like a baby.  I mean, a little baby.  I'm never going to go swing by the swing again.  You know, you take it for granted that you're just going to come down and suit up every day,  and then the day comes when you're just not going to do it anymore.  Can we do crying day?  We got to do crying day. 
[02:01:30]  Crying day.  What about Jimmy Day?  Well, Jimmy Day is ready to go, I think.  We got to do crying day.  How long is it going to take you...  And we never did mustache day.  How long is it going to take you to get crying day together?  Because someone is bringing up on the instant feedback, Bruce Kelly, the Bruce Kelly audio.  We can bring all the crying audio together and have crying day.  Bruce Kelly crying.  Do we have that here before we leave?  Huh?  You don't have that here?  We'll play it tomorrow over here, okay?  Bruce Kelly crying after he saw The Who perform. 
[02:02:00]  The Who.  Last summer or whatever it was.  Oh, my God.  It was over in England.  Oh, it's some of the best audio.  Live Aid, was it, or something?  It's Live 8.  Live 8.  Whatever the hell they called it.  And The Who was playing, and he was right up front, and he came back to announce.  And he got on mic, and he was just in tears because he saw The Who.  Who cares?  Like, what year is this, idiot?  What are you, at Woodstock?  Plus, half of them are dead.  Yeah, you're not watching The Who.  Exactly.  Seeing Roger Daltrey and some old vicar playing guitar next to him. 
[02:02:30]  I cried when I saw Pete Townsend's computer files.  So did he.  He's doing research.  Yeah.  How did he get off with that?  With Gary Glitter.  Exactly.  How did he get off with that one?  I'm researching.  That's why all my keys are stuck together.  You dirty boy.  Oh, and we got to add to Crying Day, yes.  What about the day E-Rock cried when he admitted that Opie.  Look at him while you say it.  Opie's my hero. 
[02:03:00]  Our own E-Rock had a little bout with the session of tears.  You better add that to Crying Day.  That's right.  You acting sissy.  Opie, when on his MySpace account, it was pointed out by the rest of the guys who are  so sympathetic that under heroes, he had Opie.  Yeah.  And I wasn't on there.  Neither was I.  No, me and Jimmy, not even on there, which made Opie's being a hero even more special.  And there was like one ahead.  I think your dad was first, right?  Yeah, it was dad and Opie.  Dad? 
[02:03:30]  Opie?  God.  And, uh...  God.  And Hulk Hogan.  Yeah, it was like Hulk Hogan.  Oh, it was a terrific list.  It was the most...  It was a terrific list.  It was the gayest list of heroes ever, ever.  And I have to say, I had a wonderful line.  I'm not going to repeat it now.  Oh.  All right, I will.  Go ahead.  No, you have to now, Jimmy.  It's part of the rules.  You have to.  Now you have to.  Come on, let's go.  I said the reason he made Opie number two is because that's how Opie treats him. 
[02:04:00]  Your laughing isn't going to help.  That's a good one.  Yeah, but I just wanted to crash you.  Oh, no.  Oh, I've fallen.  Why have I gotten the car crash?  Would it bother you if I, like, rebelled every time?  I don't need to be on this show every time I got a car crash?  There's no way to relive a joke.  No, you're right.  There's not.  I'm just kind of relaying it in a serious tone.  Hey, can we add some Rana Fez to Crying Day?  Yeah, Fezzy.  All right, when are we doing Crying Day?  How long is it going to take you, really?  Can we do it next week?  Oh, next week?  Yeah, next week, Crying Day. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, Crying Day next week, like early in the week, Monday or Tuesday.  All right?  And you've got to get all the other athletes crying and all that.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  I like the fact that one intern has hair like the guy in the Chuck Norris movie who died in the well.  Hmm.  Go ahead, car crashes.  I'm trying to think of it.  Which one?  The mechanical dude who was killing everybody.  Oh, you're looking at that guy over there?  Oh, yeah, him.  Okay.  Hands him out with a smile.  I thought you were pointing it, because he kind of has hair like Sensei in Karate Kid. 
[02:05:00]  Much better.  Nice smile.  You have a good smile, kid.  You're welcome.  Let's say hi to Chris in New Jersey.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Best crying in sports has to be Bob Kelly breaking his knee.  Yeah.  Bob Kelly breaking his knee.  That'll be part of Crying Day, too.  Bob is a fat worm, but it's almost understandable when you break a bone that you're going to act weird.  Hold my hand, man.  Yeah, I mean, he's a sickening girl, but...  All right.  My ownership, thanks.  It's almost understandable why Bobby cried. 
[02:05:30]  We had a dump out, but who knows what they heard there.  Okay.  All right.  I guess we're just about done for this half of the Opie and Anthony show.  This session.  This session of the O&H show.  Now we head over to what we like to call the potty mouth show.  Oh, yes.  Here you go.  Take this.  Thank you.  Bill Burr is going to be at Caroline's...  15th through the 18th.  I'm usually pretty good at remembering stuff.  I don't know what's wrong with me today.  Caroline's, June 15th through the 18th.  Yes. 
[02:06:00]  Apparently we had E-Rock's hero list wrong.  It goes, Dad, Opie, Hulk Hogan, Governor McGreevey.  People are funny.  Instant feedback.  Thank you.  We'll find the George Steinbrenner crying and all the other ones.  All right.  Come on, you Hulkamaniacs.  Yuck.  Why?  I want to be a Hulkamaniac. 
[02:06:30]  We're going to make Eric say that while we all put our...  Yeah, that was close.  In a couple of minutes, you could let that line fly.  Yes, guess we're all going to put it in Eric's face while he sings, I want to be a Hulkamaniac.  All right.  If you're not joining us for the walk or the second half of the Opie and Anthony show on XM,  thanks for checking us out.  We greatly appreciate it.  Yes, we do.  The ONA virus is spreading quite nicely so far.  Thank you, Philly. 
[02:07:00]  Thank you, Boston.  Thank you, Cleveland.  Thank you, Pittsburgh.  Thanks, Dallas.  New York.  Washington.  And West Palm Beach.  Oh, no, not yet.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  The Opie and Anthony XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Outside Free FM in New York City. 
[02:07:30]  Is that music really loud or is it me?  There we go.  For our little walk.  We got a nice crowd outside.  Jimmy Day coming to the show, right?  What day is Jimmy Day?  Friday, June 9th.  Are you excited, Jimmy?  I couldn't be happier.  He's a liar.  All right.  Yeah, I'll be signing the HBO DVD, which we will be selling at Tower Records by Lincoln  Center, I think, right?  When are we doing that?  Do we know when the day is?  Friday, June 9th at 6 p.m. 
[02:08:00]  I'm busy.  A week from tomorrow.  Are you?  Yeah.  Where you gonna be?  I'm not gonna be out of the Megan.  Where you gonna be?  I don't know.  Somewhere else.  Oh, no.  I don't want it.  Going to someone else's day.  Oh.  Oh, wait.  Your one-night stand?  They're gonna be releasing that?  Yeah.  Nice.  Let's, um...  Why don't we go straight and cross the street?  We're gonna walk on the other side of the street today.  Hi.  I remember you.  And, uh...  They're right.  Her.  That's your girlfriend.  She was on the website.  Yeah. 
[02:08:30]  Whack bag.  Are we crossing here?  Are we gonna wait?  Well, now we're gonna have to wait.  Oh, please let Ben get hit.  Ben get hit by a car.  It's good for the show.  Love to see a car dented, smash you into his cock.  There were a lot of people, uh, with your picture, and they put it up on the website,  and then people say you were really hot, and then it doesn't matter how hot a girl is,  there's a couple of people that'd be like,  Dude!  You know, she ain't that hot.  I know.  Yeah.  And then meanwhile, they would, like, fall all over you and stuff. 
[02:09:00]  They're just fat old guys.  Yeah.  There you go.  And they said I don't have an ass.  I don't think you have an ass in denim, but I did.  Jesus Christ.  How are you, sir?  Well, hold on.  What's that?  Very well, thank you.  Beautiful girl, isn't she?  Oh, he's looking at the girl.  Yes.  See?  Very beautiful.  Do you post on Whack Bag?  Sexy.  What is that?  Sexy.  I love the trachea commercial that's been running. 
[02:09:30]  He's got some action in the front of his pants.  He's got a rod.  Hold on, sir.  Do you want to come back and look at the 11-year-old while you're still sweeping up?  Sweepy old fuck.  Really?  What a dirty old man.  Exactly.  You're every guy in the good, the bad, and the ugly.  He just ran away when we realized he was popping a tent.  All right.  We're crossing the street now.  His unclipped cock.  Nice jugs.  Wow.  I actually was trying to find a T-shirt that wasn't Boston.  And I was like, I'm going to get trashed.  I just accepted it. 
[02:10:00]  I can't.  Please.  It is in New York.  You know.  Have some fucking respect.  I look like I'm trying to win tickets.  Have some respect.  Nice pair of tits coming.  I love the summer with all the braless girls, her little nipples sticking out.  Not even connected to a woman.  Yeah, just laying there in a heap.  You just walk over and mush them.  I was so bad on the 3FM, they didn't give me a microphone for the walkover.  No, we don't have a guest like Bill.  It's not you.  Bill feels bad about his appearance today.  Why?  Not like comics are insecure or anything. 
[02:10:30]  I thought you did fine, Bill.  Yeah.  Did a fine job.  Now we go over and, you know.  It's like marrying him with AIDS.  What we're used to.  Wow.  Good reference.  I'm on your way.  I'm sorry, sir.  Oh, the smell.  There is a fat person's problem.  Go away.  Why can't homeless people piss?  Oh, you want to buy a magazine?  Jimmy, you haven't bought a magazine in a while.  Jimmy, what do you need?  Hi, sir.  What do you need?  I want to buy a magazine. 
[02:11:00]  Do you have a honcho or something like that?  You got honcho last time.  No honcho.  We don't get a honcho.  Do you have anything with black guys?  Naked black guys?  No.  Anything with cock?  No.  No nudie magazines?  No nudie magazines?  No, we don't get it.  Why?  That's where the money is.  The money's in the black cock, sir.  We don't get it, sir.  No?  How about a highlight for a boy's life?  All right.  This guy's got charisma. 
[02:11:30]  That's odd.  That's the first newsstand.  Yeah.  That doesn't have the porno magazine.  It's got to be a front.  It's got to be a front for something.  He's trying to stay out of trouble.  Oh, mind your business.  Yeah, fuck off.  What?  Enough.  Just yell at people.  And so what happened was, I announced I had AIDS.  Oh, my God.  The look he just got.  Her face was priceless.  I love saying, we just walked by a lady and I blurt something out really inappropriate  so they only hear part of the conversation.  And that's the best.  I'm going to do it again. 
[02:12:00]  Do it again.  Oh.  Hey, let's be honest.  We're getting sick of Max.  Hey.  But we got to ask Max about it.  Lex Luthor.  We got to ask Max about his friend from yesterday, the guy with the huge package.  Yeah, the guy with the infected ball.  We got to find out if Max knows anything about him.  Is Max there or is it?  He's over there.  Yeah, he's there.  Okay.  Okay.  The other guy is renting his testicle out as a fucking thing at a children's party they  can jump up and down on.  Riding it like a hippity hop. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, let me see if I can get this lady.  Yeah, get that her.  Get what to come.  She told me she's pregnant, so I kicked her in the stomach.  Oh, my God.  That's so great.  She shook her head in an unapproving fashion.  How you doing there, Mac?  Hey, someone else was sitting here yesterday.  Is it a guy?  You know him?  He's got one big testicle.  One big ball in his pants?  No.  Like his balls are fucking like all swollen.  No.  He was sitting there.  He took your spot, bro. 
[02:13:00]  No, I don't know him.  Yeah, you don't know him.  He has a big bump in his pants.  Big bump right here.  He's got to be a legend on the circuit.  You have to know him.  Yeah, I would think everybody would know him.  Yeah.  Make your leg look like nothing.  Yeah.  His balls are...  Your balls okay?  Yeah.  Yeah, because his left one was...  Was...  I swear it was the size of like a watermelon.  I got a hernia.  You got a hernia?  Yeah, Bobby got one.  Oh, he got one?  Yeah.  No, I think he had like elephantitis or something.  What was he lifting?  The entire island? 
[02:13:30]  What's that?  Yeah.  His ball...  It's way too big for a hernia.  There was no way...  Yeah.  It's just a hernia.  His ball was like...  It was swollen out to there.  Big infection.  Yeah.  Or something.  Mac, what do you think of the hot girl that is doing the walk with us today?  Beautiful.  Right?  Yes, yeah.  Gorgeous.  When was the last time you had something like that?  What would you do with that?  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[02:14:00]  You don't know?  I'm old.  I'm old.  You're not too old for that.  This looks like that scene in a clockwork orange.  I'll try to do something.  Does all the equipment still work, though?  Yeah.  Yeah, it still works.  Yeah.  But it ain't seen action in a while, right?  Yeah.  Well, you're not...  No, we're not going to give her to you.  We'll give you an occasional buck or two, but you can't get girls.  There you go, Jimmy.  Which one?  The one in the blue is a nosy buddy. 
[02:14:30]  Hey, Fatso!  Hey, busybody.  You're a busybody.  She saw us talking to the homeless guy, Mac, here.  Who's a friend of ours.  Yes.  And she was all disgusted.  Yeah.  All right, buddy.  Oh, man.  Good seeing you.  We're off.  Take it easy there, bro.  Bye, Mac.  Junior!  Every day we get to see Junior now.  Hey, Uncle Junior!  Hey, Tony! 
[02:15:00]  I got the big casino, Tony!  Where's Dr. Kennedy?  Got Salomaranga!  Notice that fucking Tony Bennett doesn't come this way anymore?  Before I had enough of him, enough to try to be nice to him.  That guy is Tony.  He is Uncle Junior.  That guy is...  Yes.  He is absolutely Uncle Junior.  So I'm laughing.  I ate her asshole.  Oh, my God.  Stop.  Get this one.  I can't.  She's too far away.  Get this big dopey guy.  All right.  Let me get this.  Here, get this one.  A woman.  Right here.  Right here. 
[02:15:30]  Here she is.  Something stupid.  So she had a baby, and I kicked it.  Oh, my God.  What's your getting?  Oh, dude.  I mean, I tested positive, but I'm not telling her.  Oh, my God.  Just as the woman passes.  So my father fucked me in the mouth.  Oh, my God.  You know.  Oh, sorry.  I ate her asshole and laughed.  Oh, my God.  That's so...  That's so disgusting.  I ate her asshole and laughed.  All right.  Here comes this other guy here. 
[02:16:00]  Right?  This is an older gentleman.  So I say, fuck America.  All right.  Why don't we do a short walk?  How you doing, sweetie?  Yeah.  Why don't we do a short walk today?  All right.  We're done.  We're done.  Guys, thank you.  We got some radio to do.  Thank you.  The second half of the Opie and Anthony show starts in moments.  Opie and Anthony.  XM 202.  Mexican.  That sucks.  Lesbian.  I like that in a woman.  Read every other kind of TV.  I love paying for sex. 
[02:16:30]  This moral decays.  Huh?  Weakens our resistance.  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of deceit.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  It's pedophile humor.  Woo!  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  It's a bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain. 
[02:17:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  No, baby!  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back. 
[02:17:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:18:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:18:30]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  The elevator ride is becoming a fucking nightmare.  Holy shit.  We got it.  Oh, goddammit.  Hey, starting tomorrow, we've got to start taping the elevator ride.  Just get a dat recorder or something  Because that's unbelievable 
[02:19:00]  What he gets away with  We're waiting a long time for the elevator  So a lot of people were building up in the lobby  And we gotta get up here first  So we all load into the elevator  But other people also did  So as the doors are closing  I went, uh oh, I think this elevator's overloaded  Now the last person that walked in  Was this big fat black woman  And Jimmy goes  No, it's alright, she's not all that big  And she was mortified  And then I look at the buttons 
[02:19:30]  To the elevator  And was that you, Kenny?  Yeah  Kenny reaches over and pushed every single button  From the 5th floor up to the 15th  Just one at a time  Click, click  So they are now on a hell ride up to the 15th floor  Stopping on every single floor  I want a fruit juice  Juice?  I want a smoothie  I want cold carrot juice  Freshly squeezed with a little bit of ginger  For my stomach

Fat smash diet, yeah  No, none  I haven't done it yet  I've just been working out 
[02:20:30]  I'm starting to swim now  But it swells my fucking foot up  Every time I do it  I can't swim  Because I only do the breaststroke  Anything more pathetic than  Picturing him shirtless  In a fucking pool  Doing the breaststroke  Bob Kelly  With your bathing cap on  I was swimming  And Bob Kelly said  When you swim  Do people stand along the edge  And watch you and clap?  It looks like one of those  You know those premature babies  They gotta stick them in that crap  You know, but I'm getting trimmed, Bill  You know how this man gets trimmed  All right  I'm a slender gentleman

No, it's nice  It's not hot at all  It's a little chilly, actually  You believe that girl came back  Just because  She got a little criticism  On Wack Bag  Yeah, you should explain that  At least we're getting  Some women  To join us  For the walk  There's that girl  She's like 18 years old  Cute girl  She's hot, man  Yeah  And last time she was here  She looked 
[02:21:30]  She looked good  She looked good  They took pictures of her  Put her up on the website  And said  Who was the hot chick  That was walking with O&A  And then of course  On Wack Bag  It can never be 100%  Like most of the people  Are like, holy shit  She's so hot  This, that  And then other guys  Are like, eh  She ain't all that  Or she wasn't that good  Or anything  So I guess  She took it as an insult  So she came back  All made up and everything  You know, she had  A little more makeup on  Her hair was nice

[02:46:00]  To have one leg  She is the worst  What a phony bitch  And you guys  When I was trying to walk  That's balling  She wouldn't even do  Like the commitment  Of that  She would just tape a leg up  That's what I'm saying  I taped it up for five minutes  And go  I know what it's like now  I know  She would just take off  One high heel  So the other one  Just kinda dangled there  Josh Blue  The comic with CP  Let's hear it first

[02:47:00]  I might do things a little differently  It would be you ma'am  Awesome mom  My mom is a great person  She's the only person in the world  Who can tell when I'm drunk  She's like  Josh are you walking straighter  I heard you come home  Put the key right in the door  And you're naked 
[02:47:30]  And you're naked  That's not bad right  Yeah that's fine  Yeah but he's so uncomfortable to watch  His arm is way behind him  He's shaking and twitching  And it's hard to get words out  Like everything's in effort  I don't  Please  Once they find cerebral palsy in the womb  You won't see that shit anymore  Believe me  But for now  We can always enjoy the comedy  Scrake the blood out  Oh yeah please  A big hot shoe  And it's fucking out in the dumpster  And let's start over  God bless the people with CP though man 
[02:48:00]  There's one in my neighborhood  And he wears a suit every day  And a briefcase  And just watching him walk a block  It's such an effort  It makes you want to sit down and rest  Yeah  It's unbelievable  And I saw him hailing a cab once  And I'm just mesmerized by this guy  Every move is just so much work  And then there's E-Rock  It takes this guy probably  Where every move is nothing  Every move is dreck  It's just  Every rare move 
[02:48:30]  Act of shit and futility  It takes the average person to walk  The average person  It takes what  30 to 40 seconds to walk a block  I watch this guy walk a block  It takes him 3 minutes  And he's walking  Like multiple blocks with his suit  He obviously still goes to work  His briefcase  Oh my god  As he's walking  He's dropping the briefcase  And then he has to struggle  To try to pick it back up  It is like the most tiring thing to watch  He's a spectacle  He better wait until that green  I like how you watched him  The whole time though  The whole fucking  What am I going to do? 
[02:49:00]  Film him  Like a dog on him  Watch a pit bull fucking  Make him run  What dog is going to attack him?  Anyone  Dog is too scared  Rip that stupid briefcase out of his hand  And examine what's in it  Nothing worse than when that red  Don't walk thing starts flashing  And they decide then to start  Crossing the street  I'm sitting there in the truck  Going don't even  No  No you're going to be right in front of me  You got to just honk at him  Hope his spine straightens up real quick  Watch him attempt to run  Oh my god  Is that a great line 
[02:49:30]  Hope the little sports car next to me  Can't see him  Crossing in front of my car  And hits the gas  Appearing from in front of my grill  Just tiring to look at  Alright  We got the comic with the lisp  And the cleft palette there I guess  Her name is Nikki  Last Comic Standing  Episode 1  Oh wow  Energy  Oh my god  Thank you for having energy  Woo  Woohoo  Woohoo  How you doing today folks  Wouldn't it be cool if we could answer all those questions

They didn't even hear it Bill  I  No  We're having two different conversations here  You two were talking about something  And I was telling Jim  To put his cock away  Go ahead  Don't rest it on an orange on the console either  Orange you're glad I didn't take it out?  Jesus  Alright  I feel like I'm testifying  So anyway  1989  Working at WCMF in Rochester  Brother Weez had Mark Price on 
[02:52:30]  He was starting his comedy career  In 89  After being skippy  And he was on Last Comic Standing  And he did not  Lost our teeth  Lost our teeth  Lost our teeth  Lost our teeth  Like speaking  When that cleft palate girl goes on  They should know it's almost her turn  Because the waitress walks around  Handing out tomatoes and rocks  Who the fuck could listen to that for an hour?

[03:17:30]  Meet Jim Norton  Get his new One Night Stand DVD  And grab a preview copy  Of Lucky Louie  Episode 1  The new HBO sitcom  Featuring Little Jimmy Norton  I'm an entertainer  Friday June 9th  Tower Records  Lincoln Center  Starting at 6pm  I'm an entertainer  I'm an entertainer  I'm an entertainer  I'm an entertainer  I'm an entertainer  I'm an entertainer  I'm an entertainer  I'm an entertainer  I'm an entertainer  I'm an entertainer  I'm an entertainer  I'm an entertainer  I'm an entertainer  I'm an entertainer  I'm an entertainer  I'm an entertainer 
[03:18:00]  I'm an entertainer  I'm an entertainer  I'm an entertainer  I'm an entertainer  I'm an entertainer  I'm an entertainer  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show  on XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, Christ. 
[03:18:30]  Anal bleaching cream.  It's never a boring day around here.  They've used it on Dr. 90210.  Where an adult movie starly came into the office and exclaimed,  I'm here for the anal bleaching.  This touched off a search.  On our part, we looked high and low to find the right product to use  to bleach the skin around your anus.  I know this sounds completely outrageous and even perverted,  but it's our job, after all, the purpose of shopinprivate.com,  I guess that's who's selling this or something, 
[03:19:00]  is to prevent you from having to ask a pharmacist an embarrassing question.  Anyway, here's the product that you should try  if you want to keep your bum hole looking younger.  It is 2% hydroquinone formula.  Gets darker as you get older?  That is, does it?  I don't know.  It's gentle enough for most people to use in sensitive areas.  I hope so, because that's a pretty sensitive area. 
[03:19:30]  And I guess you, how do you apply it?  Syringe.  Fucking ball-peen hammer.  You just inject it in there.  And you rub this cream on your asshole at nighttime, it says.  For the young, for the look of youthful, radiant, even-toned skin.  Fade cream on the box, it says.  As opposed to that knot-in-the-wood look.  Like a fucking redwood. 
[03:20:00]  That's good.  Yeah.  Well, if you want to, if you want to, I, like I said, I, my hat's off to you there.  Yeah, I mean, I was, uh.  I didn't think that was real.  That's real.  Yeah, I was sitting, I was watching the news.  And, you know.  On a brown eye.  A story came up there.  We got Brett Ratner calling in from X-Men?  Yeah.  What?  Director, right?  Is he the director?  Better be.  All right. 
[03:20:30]  Um, here are the-  X-Men 3.  He's promoting X-Men.  Didn't that make $120 million the first weekend?  Huge opening.  One of the greatest openings ever, huh?  You better get out there and promote that shit.  You better get out there.  You start banging on some doors.  You start doing some radio, my friend.  Uh, here's the details for Jimmy Day.  Oh, Jimmy.  Yes, no, I'm looking forward to this eagerly.  Oh, boy.  I don't, I don't like when Jimmy's not in a corner.  He's in a good mood. 
[03:21:00]  He's going with the white socks.  I feel bad.  I always wear white socks.  Because he's such a, he's a happy-looking fellow.  And then when he's unhappy, it doesn't mix with his looks.  Look, you're so happy-looking.  He smiled, and then the smile just faded into this miserable face.  I am excited.  We're going to make Jimmy Day work.  It's going to turn it into a 24-hour event.  Yes.  Elo Brainstorm, which was a great idea. 
[03:21:30]  Mm-hmm.  I love the idea.  I think it's great.  Yeah.  Just, uh, well, they wanted to show you some, you know, respect, and they wanted to...  Well, well, let me, let me take a look at my copy of the Jimmy Day festivities.  Oh, that's right.  I didn't get any.  I didn't get any.  This is not Jimmy Day.  This is Jimmy Half Day.  Where's my copy?  I didn't get my copy either.  This is...  Uh, for some reason, uh, they just decided to bring one copy in for everybody.  Why would you bring one copy in?  Steve just shoved E-Rock.  There's, uh, this is, like, almost Jimmy Day. 
[03:22:00]  Where's the other copies of it?  I don't know.  I'd like to see it.  Lately, they've been handing out a lot of copies, but I don't know why they didn't.  I'm sorry.  Why did you not promote Jimmy Day?  Well...  Why that would be the funnest thing ever.  The idea was great.  The original idea was great, but, uh, unfortunately, someone fucked it up.  Sure.  Somebody just fucked it up.  Yep.  Somebody.  What happened?  I don't know.  I'm hearing all...  By ruining the bit here?  No, you're not, really.  So, uh, the Jimmy Day details, uh, it'll be a week from tomorrow, Friday, June 9th, at 6pm. 
[03:22:30]  Jimmy Day, uh, will start at 6pm.  6pm?  Wait a minute.  Jimmy Quarter Day.  All right, hold the phone.  Jimmy Quarter Day.  Hold the fucking phone here.  Jimmy Hour.  It's, uh, the Jimmy Hour.  6pm?  6pm.  See, if you...  Uh, you know what?  Big Daddy James.  One hour only.  You know, it really doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out, you know, Jimmy Day. 
[03:23:00]  Jimmy Day, first of all, has to start at 5am.  Well, Jimmy doesn't get there until...  Whatever.  Whatever.  So, when Jimmy gets there, let's say.  Okay?  The second Jimmy walks through the door, we all go, happy Jimmy Day!  And it's Jimmy's day from the whole day.  And these are all the bullet points, by the way.  Yeah.  Like, maybe I should go back into promotions.  Maybe I should just go back into promotions.  Oh, God.  Just silence this mic and just do the stuff behind the scenes and start marketing it the correct way. 
[03:23:30]  Maybe Jimmy's so lovable, you couldn't tolerate 24 hours of it.  See, this is it.  Don, do you have a pen and piece of paper?  I'm going to help you out.  First of all, Jimmy Day starts when Jimmy gets there.  So, that would mean probably a massive buffet of things Jimmy likes.  Right.  And then when we start our show, we'll talk about how Jimmy Day has begun and the buffet  is here.  All the things that Jimmy likes.  The unusual stuff he likes to eat in the morning. 
[03:24:00]  Yes.  It's not stuff that Anthony and I like to eat and drink.  Just Jimmy.  It's not going to be a plain bagel and club soda.  No.  It's not going to be my stupid oatmeal and my blueberries.  It's going to be things that Jimmy likes.  Do you get it?  And then we're all going to wear, like, a little thing on our noses.  Oh, we all wear Breathe Right strips.  See, there's two ideas right there that I don't see on my Jimmy Day piece.  Two obvious things.  You hand out the thing, the nose things for everybody.  The whole staff gets a nose thing that day. 
[03:24:30]  Also, Jimmy likes girls.  Jimmy likes girls, yes.  So if we can promote this to get girls down here to come down and maybe do some things  that Jimmy likes, what about that?  That would be part of Jimmy Day pre-6 p.m.  So, Don, write this down.  We will do your job for you.  And the promotion.  And you'll get to look like a hero.  First of all, it has to be a buffet.  A morning buffet featuring all the stuff Jimmy likes.  You might want to call Jimmy. 
[03:25:00]  Well, you better not call Jimmy, actually.  You might want to email Jimmy and ask him what he likes to eat in the morning.  Or ask Ben.  Yeah.  Get the Breathe Right strips for the entire show, and we'll have to wear them, okay?  There's two things right there.  I get embarrassed with such positive attention.  We need girls.  Lots and lots of girls.  Girls, girls, girls.  Come down.  Come down.  We need girls with dicks.  Let's be honest.  We need it on.  Let's just be honest.  If it's going to be Jimmy Day, we need girls with dicks. 
[03:25:30]  And we need it on the promos that are running.  And Jimmy can make believe, like, oh, cut it out, guys.  Yeah.  As I sneak off with one.  Right.  Come on.  Cut it out.  You.  Your turn.  It's your day, Daddy.  Hi, Daddy.  I mean, so, Don, write that down.  Girls with dicks.  And we're dead serious, by the way.  At least one, so Jimmy can have a fun day.  Yeah.  All right.  What else that's not on this list?  Some kind of Sabbath theme. 
[03:26:00]  Right.  Loves the Aussie.  Yeah.  Makes something out of that.  How about all these Sabbath rejoiners that day?  Yeah, that's good.  Well, here's Jimmy Day, according to the gang down in Washington.  It's the whole thing.  Jimmy Day details.  Well, the first point, it starts Friday, June 9th, at 6 p.m.  6 p.m.  So we'll wait until 6 p.m., and then all of a sudden we'll go, hey, it's Jimmy Day.  Where's a pen?  Because I must change this to Jimmy Night.  Because there's no day included in this. 
[03:26:30]  How about an evening with James?  Jimmy Evening.  It's June 9th, 6 p.m.  Oh, God.  All right.  Prime time.  Yeah.  And we've got to make believe we're equal with these people.  That just amazes me sometimes.  No, you're just like us, really.  Not really.  I mean, not really, you know.  I've been doing radio 20 years.  You've been doing it eight months.  Yeah, we're on the same level. 
[03:27:00]  God.  This is not even a bit, by the way.  This is just ridiculous.  Yeah, it's not sounding like it.  It's sounding really bitter.  We're going to run out of time with all these details if you don't get to number two.  So, the first one, Friday, June 9th at 6 p.m.  Jimmy Day will begin.  And it will be at Tower Records at Lincoln Center.  Norton and ONA signage all over store.  Wonderful.  Number three for Jimmy Day. 
[03:27:30]  Yes, Jimmy.  I just don't like the word signage.  I hate the word signage.  That's signs.  This is like a birthday party for like a five-year-old.  Yeah, that's how it's planned out.  There's going to be a pony.  Hats, cake, and then pin the tail on the donkey.  What if people are allergic to the cake?  Oh, we're going to need an option for that.  Lollipops.  Mm-hmm.  Need some candy hats.  I think Jimmy should have a tiara to separate him from the other party guests to make him feel  more special.  I don't see a limo here for Jimmy. 
[03:28:00]  Well, they did offer me one.  I turned it down.  Okay.  It's expensive.  They don't have to waste the money.  Why would they want to waste their money on you?  No, that's my idea.  I mean, I'll take a cab.  They did offer me a limo, and I was like, no, that's cool.  Number three, 250 free copies of Jim's one-night stand DVD.  Not just sleeves, actual DVDs.  Which is very nice.  I was surprised at that because they were going to sell it at the Tower.  I guess XM bought them, which they really didn't have to do.  Maybe that's how they got them.  I don't know the details of that. 
[03:28:30]  Give them that one.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  And finally, Jimmy Day, the last bullet point here for Jimmy Day.  Also, every person there will get a free preview copy of Lucky Louie, episode one,  the new HBO sitcom featuring Jim Norton.  Mm-hmm.  And just other things to spice up Jimmy Day, according to the gang in Washington.  Promos are running on high voltage and XM third-party channels.  Yeah.  So I guess on Ethel or something like that, you'll hear a promo for Jimmy Day.  CB Channel 5. 
[03:29:00]  So that'll get the word out there.  Only Jim Norton filler material on CBS and XM on June 9th.  Really?  Next Friday.  That's going to get boring for people, though.  You don't want to...  No, we love Jimmy.  No, but I mean, you got to mix it up a little bit.  Yeah, but Jim, it's your day.  Oh, good point.  Oh, good point.  Oh, good point.  It's Jimmy Day.  XM Comedy Channel 150 is also featuring Jim's comedy once an hour throughout the entire  day, including a run of his stand-up sit-down that will run at 10 p.m.  It was just a wraparound I did with Sonny.  Here's what was originally...  This is the only reason I'm annoyed. 
[03:29:30]  I mean, of course, I love the fact that they thought of me.  It's very nice.  Elo came up with the idea.  It was going to be there.  We were going to have a signing at 5 o'clock.  I actually suggested 6 instead of 5 so people could get there from work.  Yeah.  And then do a preview of Lucky Louie right after that at the Hard Rock.  The reason the preview didn't happen was HBO said, I think, no to that because they're  concerned they had an entourage party that night, a big party in New York, and they don't  want something being...  Which I understand.  They don't want something competing against their big thing.  It looks bad for entourage.  It's kind of poor taste. 
[03:30:00]  And they don't know what the audio-video setup's going to be.  So they don't want to have any kind of a commitment to a place that's not a theater  for a premiere.  Right.  Which makes sense.  It's the way they do stuff.  They don't want the product to look bad.  Absolutely.  So, I mean, it's like, cool.  I just, this is fine with me.  I don't need to...  But it's not Jimmy Day.  That's...  It's Jimmy at Tower Records.  Yeah.  Signing DVDs of his one-night stand.  That's great.  It's an appearance.  That's an appearance.  Let's just promote this as an appearance with Jim Norton.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because this is not Jimmy Day.  And I refuse to promote this as Jimmy Day. 
[03:30:30]  Jimmy Day should be just unbelievably huge.  You know what has to be added to this?  There should be, like, a theme on Jimmy Day when we walk from CBS to here.  All that stuff should be figured out.  Everything we do that day should have a Jimmy theme.  And then they bitch at us, you know, because we don't come up with other stuff for this channel.  Why should we?  Why should we when you mess it up?  Give me the pen.  Jimmy Day is a no-brainer promotion.  Pen.  I have to add to Jimmy Day, Anthony get hotel-y day. 
[03:31:00]  Because if June 9th is a Friday at 6 p.m., if I try to leave here on a Friday after 6, it will be Anthony shoots people on the road day.  Because you know how much I love Friday rush hour.  So, get me a hotel.  Give me my pen.  You know where I stay.  Stat.  So, let's just book it now, because if it's not available, it's going to be trouble.  Let's promote this as a Jim Norton appearance that Anthony and I would be glad to be at and hang. 
[03:31:30]  Honored.  Honored.  Of course we would.  Because this is not Jimmy Day.  This is embarrassing.  Once again, by the way.  I just wanted people, I was worried that nobody would show up to the tower signing.  Like a party.  Like he's worried that no one's coming to his party.  Yeah, it was going to be embarrassed.  I was standing there like a tool, a bunch of HBO DVDs, all fucking ready for the pen, a sharpie.  I only need one. 
[03:32:00]  The sharpie leaves in perfect condition.  Yeah.  Still perfectly pointed at the end of the night.  30 people.  Dude, you know, it should be.  Hey, dude.  It should be such a big deal.  The whole show should be us bringing in guests that Jimmy likes, whether it's Chicks with Dicks or Ozzy himself.  No, call them frannies.  Chicks with Dicks is just too fucking literal and real.  Or Ozzy, you know, Kiss.  That's what it should be.  People that interest Jim, whether they're really famous or just some schmuck that he shared an experience with in a rest area once. 
[03:32:30]  Yes.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I would never want them.  I never understood why they call it Jimmy Day.  Not that I'm bitching about it.  No.  It could have just been like a signing event and then the Lucky Louie thing, which I was kind of glad that.  No, we came up with the concept.  I think it would be awesome if it's done right.  I just get shy.  I think it could be really, really cool.  People are saying some things for Jimmy Day that everybody that goes there pisses their pants beforehand to fill the room with that smell. 
[03:33:00]  You know, yeah, someone is suggesting, see, these are, God, do you guys want to work for us?  Look how obvious it is and easy it is to just come up with things for Jimmy Day.  Jerry in Texas, go.  Hey, why don't you, on the walkthrough, have him be carried like a Greek god up in a chair.  See?  In one of those, they're called a litter.  I don't see that on my paper.  People can carry.  We'll get like, well, they'd have to be, I don't think girls could carry you, right? 
[03:33:30]  No, really fat chicks.  Big fat chicks on an ancient, like, Roman litter.  How about shirtless men?  Shirtless buff men.  Buff shirtless men carrying Jimmy while a girl feeds you grapes on top of it also.  Jimmy Day has to be.  I like grapes, Jimmy.  Jimmy, Jimmy laying on his side with his head in his, yeah, with his head in his, while  she puts grapes up his ass.  While she puts anal, anal, uh, bleach.  Bleach.  With her fucking fist and caligularing. 
[03:34:00]  Jimmy Day has to be all-encompassing.  You have to have, like, ivy for your head, like Caesar.  Yeah.  Ooh.  And, uh, you'll be carried down the street.  I think that's a great idea.  See?  It's just an appearance at this point.  Back to the drawing board, fellas.  Oh.  You need to work on, uh, a really cool walk from CBS to XM for Jimmy Day.  You gotta work on the buffet.  You gotta work on guests for the entire show.  Make it work.  Make it work.  Ow. 
[03:34:30]  Maybe a, maybe a lunch with the listeners.  Oh, come on.  Whatever.  I'm just throwing, you know, quick ideas out.  But it should be an all-day thing that, uh, by the end of it, people are like, all right,  enough.  What are you doing?  I just hope they show up.  Let's say hi to Brett Ratner.  Brett!  Yeah?  Sorry to make you wait, buddy.  Brett, there he is.  No problem.  What's up, buddy?  How you doing, man?  Uh, nothing much sitting here doing a radio show while, uh, I guess you're just, just  money falling into your windows and doorway and...  Don't worry.  I'm busy counting it. 
[03:35:00]  Is that it?  We're like, why, why is this guy promoting a movie that is so gigantically huge?  122 million.  We usually get people from movies that need promotion and we have to make believe we're  actually going to see the movie.  Yeah, no, it looks good.  Uh, yeah.  I'll go see it.  Yeah, Soul Plane.  That sounds great.  I'm going to be the first one online, uh, Snoop.  It's like, but I mean, obviously everybody going out to see, uh, X-Men 3.  I can't wait.  I can't wait. 
[03:35:30]  $130 million so far.  That's crazy.  How much does it cost to make?  I don't, they don't really tell me that.  No, that's...  That's a good move, see?  Because there's all that thing with the profit.  Because the movies, these movies never really make a profit, do they?  No.  No matter how much the movie makes, it's like the, uh, the, the, the production company,  the, uh, the movie studio goes, I don't know, we just broke even.  We just happened to, a coincidence again, we just broke even, no one makes money.  Nobody.  You've done some other stuff. 
[03:36:00]  I'm looking at, um, the, uh, NYU student film you did, Whatever Happened to Mason Reese?  Mason Reese, yeah.  Are you kidding?  What the hell made you, now, I remember Mason Reese growing up as a kid, he did the, um,  the Underwood Deviled Ham commercials.  Yeah.  And used to say, it, it tastes like a morgish board.  A borgish board.  A borgish board.  He couldn't say smorgish board.  And, uh, what, did you actually search him out?  I found, I bumped into him on the street and I was like, I want to make you a star.  And that was like one of my first student films.  I, I saw him in my neighborhood recently. 
[03:36:30]  This really is a true story.  Really?  At my hamburger joint with his, with his little fat fingers eating a burger.  And I'm, and I couldn't believe no one in the joint knew who he was.  Oh, no.  He looks exactly the same.  Yeah.  He's a legend.  He just looks like, yeah.  Did you just decide it was kind of a cool college subject to look quirky?  No, no, it was just something that I grew up on him and, you know, Danny Bonaduce and all  those guys.  So he was like, I have a fascination with like child stars.  So, Oh, you do.  He was like a child star.  And whatever happened to Rodney Allen Rippey? 
[03:37:00]  Exactly.  That was going to be the sequel to whatever happened to me.  What happened to the little kid they brought on the last season of the Partridge family?  Exactly.  Yeah.  What was that guy's name?  I was a little kid that lived next door.  Eat down pets.  Eat down pets.  No.  You ass.  So do we even have to talk about this movie, Brent?  Do we even have to?  Why?  I mean, it's, uh, no, it was, it was incredible making it.  I mean, really, it was, it was, um, for me, it was like a dream. 
[03:37:30]  I was supposed to direct Superman.  Yeah.  And then I left Superman and I thought I'll never get a chance to do a superhero movie  because Bryan Singer's got his X-Men and Sam Raimi's got Spider-Man and, and, uh, now  Chris Nolan was directing Batman.  But then when Bryan left X-Men, I was like, shit, I gotta, I gotta do this.  Yep.  And, uh, it looks like you made a better move, my friend.  Why did he leave X-Men?  I'm sorry?  Why did Bryan leave X-Men?  I don't know.  He just, he, I mean, look, I, I, I, Rush Hour is my franchise.  And if I got offered Superman, which I did, but while I was doing a, a Rush Hour movie, 
[03:38:00]  I would have left to go do Superman just because, I mean, I grew up on Superman.  Superman was like the coolest thing ever.  Yeah.  But it seems like, like X-Men right now is, is, um, is hot, you know?  So totally, like, busting at the seams, making money.  How do you direct, uh, uh, you would do, you, like you said, your, your franchise there  being, uh, Rush Hour.  Or how do you, is it, is it harder to direct something that has a lot of CGI?  You know, yeah, that's difficult. 
[03:38:30]  I mean, I don't know, there's a sequence in the movie where we move the Golden Gate Bridge  and I was like, how the hell are we going to do this?  And then when I started seeing Tess, I was like, holy shit, myself, I couldn't believe  it.  But it's, it's, um, it's not easy.  I mean, this, we had at one point on, on the set between 750 and 1,000 people on any given  day.  Jesus Christ.  We had 150 Teamsters on the movie alone.  Oh, that must have been nice.  They didn't make money, did they?  No, you didn't make a dime.  So it was a huge, huge, huge production, but almost like a kid in a candy store. 
[03:39:00]  Come on, I mean, I got Halle Berry and, and Ian McKellen and Hugh Jackman and all these  great actors.  It's like, I couldn't wait to get to the set to direct them.  And every character has superpowers and I'm blowing shit up and I'm, I mean, it's exciting.  Are you doing the actual directing during like a lot of the green screening and stuff  like that?  I mean, but like, how do you know what the fuck to do when you don't have experience doing  that?  It was the most expensive student film ever made.  I was getting paid to learn, really. 
[03:39:30]  It was unbelievable.  I mean, I mean, I mean, look, the trick is really surround myself with the best people  in the world.  And that's what I did.  Apparently so.  Cause it costs a lot of money.  Cause you made nothing.  And I'm about to do rush hour three next, which is exciting.  Cause, uh, uh, I'm going to shoot that in Paris.  Oh, wow.  You just, now you, now he just picks locations he wants to go to.  Exactly.  Where's this one going to be?  Yeah, Paris.  I think we should go to Chicago.  Well, it's great because most of them will be fish out of water because in the first one,  Chris was in the Hong Kong.  I mean, Jackie was in LA.  He was the fish out of water.  Chris went to Hong Kong for the second one. 
[03:40:00]  He was the fish.  Now both are going to be fish out of water.  They both don't speak the language.  Yeah.  It's going to be so much fun.  I cannot wait.  Does Jackie fight off a whole bunch of people with a baguette?  Yeah.  That I want to see.  With a crate.  Please include them killing a mime.  Yeah.  That would be great.  Some, some chair fight where a mime's head just goes flying.  I think you're friends with my manager.  Do you know Jonathan Brandenstein?  Yeah, of course.  Okay.  I just had to make sure I wasn't lying.  Always the Johnny tie in. 
[03:40:30]  Jonathan knows everybody.  Took me to Cuba.  Did he really?  Oh, he talks about Cuba.  Cuba all the time.  Oh, boy.  We were having sushi and he was talking about Cuba.  Jonathan's a mule for something.  I don't know what, but he comes back with little balloons.  He's fucking smuggling something.  He can't get enough of Cuba.  Dude, he's a really weird genius.  How'd you work that out going to Cuba?  It was great.  It was a scam.  He said, hey, hire this lawyer.  Pay this lawyer like 25 grand and I'm allowed to bring a private jet into Havana.  Wow. 
[03:41:00]  So we flew on a, my friend has a Gulfstream and we flew into Havana on a Gulfstream, which  is pretty cool.  Don't you got to leave from like Canada though?  No, no.  No, because we got permission from the U.S. government.  That's why I had to get a lawyer to like get clearance.  Oh, and then you got to put, and you make like a donation.  Yeah, we were there like an official business.  Official business.  What did you do?  Well, I, I, I have movie business.  I, I, I bought the rights to Che Guevara's life.  All right.  So we had to do some research, man, see where he was born, you know.  Jesus.  We had to inspect some of the Cuban girls, you know. 
[03:41:30]  This guy's living the life.  Oh, man.  That's living the life.  Wow.  That's, uh, that's something.  Must be nice to have a friend that has a plane.  The food is incredible.  I mean, in Cuba, I got to tell you, the cigars, the food, the women, it's.  That's what you call pussy down there?  Oh, yeah.  I heard they won't let American, like Cuban girls into some of the hotels there, like the  big tourist hotels.  No.  You got to do it in a dark alley in the corner.  Nice.  Even better.  I'm kidding.  It's a little dangerous. 
[03:42:00]  No, it's, um, it's, uh, no, they don't let the Cuban locals in the hotels.  No?  No.  Keep the riffraff out.  Who else is going?  Well, I guess I'm so self-centered, look, with the United States.  The whole rest of the world.  The whole rest of the world goes, but, you know, what's there to do?  In Havana, it's really about just, I mean, it's like being in Paris, but, first of  all, it's a time warp.  Every car is from 1960 and before.  Yeah.  How come they don't have cars from, like, Japan, though, or other more modern cars?  They can't afford it.  Oh, okay.  They can't afford it.  No, it's a poor, it's a poor, poor country, I guess. 
[03:42:30]  Once the U.S. cuts you off, my friend, you're broke.  They got Russian cars.  Yeah.  Brad, what's your impression?  Are they happy down there?  How can you not be happy on the Caribbean island?  I mean, they're hungry.  They're not starving.  They got bread and rice, you know?  Bread and rice and a piece.  But when you're in Cuba, do you feel like the people are suffering, or...?  Yeah, they're suffering.  I mean, communism doesn't work.  We've figured that out.  So, it's not a good place.  Yeah, it looks a little rough from the window of a Gulf Stream.  There's going to be a lot of money. 
[03:43:00]  I mean, look, there's still a lot of tourism there.  I guess a lot of Europeans go.  And, unfortunately, Americans really can't go.  Why don't you take that Gulf Stream over and drop some of that X-Men money down on him?  I don't think money would help him.  I think you'd have to drop some other stuff.  Another week, and you'll be able to buy Cuba.  That's amazing.  He's not kidding, Brett.  No, it's looking great, man.  People are really digging the movie.  The reviews are great.  Just to make this movie was a dream come true.  And, now, to break all these records and to have the biggest movie ever in the history of Memorial Day 
[03:43:30]  and beat every Spielberg movie is exciting.  I mean, Spielberg's my hero.  How nervous do you get before those big weekends?  I mean, you know that they want the movie to make at least $100 million, right?  Yeah, I mean, they would like that.  I mean, you can't always control that.  But, you know, it's big.  I mean, the chairman of the studio actually said to me, you know, if you screw this up, you know, 
[03:44:00]  basically you're going to ruin your career.  But if you feel good, you're going to be a big director.  I'm like, oh, thanks.  Not too much pressure.  The pressure's big, but it's fun, too, at the same time.  I mean, come on.  I got superheroes.  I got Halle Berry.  I got Rebecca Romaine nude.  How can I not be happy?  Yeah, I heard about that, huh?  Nice without all that blue stuff on our shot.  But you and I should do a film together.  Let's do it.  Oh, Jimmy.  What?  Stop trying to network. 
[03:44:30]  Jimmy was in Spider-Man.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he was in the first one.  He was Surly Truck Driver.  I had one line, but it was basically the pivot point of the film.  Without me, the whole thing collapsed.  He said this.  I actually have the line.  Hold on.  Here he is.  They were doing like a roving reporter, what people think of Spider-Man.  And Jimmy said this.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  A lot of people called me the linchpin for the film.  Are you getting checks from that line?  What's that?  Are you getting checks?  Dude, it was amazing. 
[03:45:00]  It was like an hour shoot with second unit.  I got a thousand...  You got an X-Men money.  I still get money from that.  I probably made six grand total off that one line.  Are you kidding?  Dude, they have the union.  SAG is great.  I got so much.  It's coming.  They're going to come for the rest of your life.  And every once in a while, you'll open your mail, and there's a check there?  Not only 80 bucks, but I mean, it's like still hilarious.  But yeah, just to know that that's coming in like...  What was that, five years ago?  That's good hooker money.  Oh, it's fantastic.  Well, not anymore.  Not for 80 bucks.  Well, true.  Half a hooker for you.  Quarter of a hooker for Jimmy Day. 
[03:45:30]  All right, Brett.  Well, good luck, man.  Yeah, the guy doesn't need any luck on this one.  Good luck with your future ventures.  And of course, a lot of people talking about some of the surprises in this X-Men movie.  People are what?  The surprises.  There's a few things.  Yeah, there's a few things.  A lot happens in this movie.  And it's the last one.  So if you love the...  I mean, I don't think you need to see the first two movies, because I think this one's  still enjoyable, but...  Smart guy.  But it's a fun ride.  I mean, it's like a roller coaster. 
[03:46:00]  So, I mean, I think it's something that...  Can't wait to buy the DVD, and then buy the special edition one, and then buy the one with  all three of them, and then buy the special edition one with all three of them, and then  the one with the commentary, and the one with behind the scenes.  Jesus Christ, I got to buy the same movie 18 times.  How many copies of Lord of the Rings do I own?  I swear to you, I own like about 12 copies.  That's so funny.  Hey, Brett, we're going to let you go, but this guy, Michael, from Atlanta, wants to  know, why do the internet nerds hate you?  Is that true?  They all hate me.  I don't know why.  Is that really true?  What is that based on? 
[03:46:30]  Probably because I get laid.  Because he gets laid, and he's on a dump stream, sipping wine, smoking.  Wine, smoking Cubans, and banging Cuban girls.  Of course you'd hate him.  Yeah, no, there's a lot of...  I mean, when I got the movie, I called Bryan Singer, and I said, Bryan, give me some advice.  I thought he was going to say, well, you know, when you speak to Magneto, tell him, he's  like, Brett, whatever you do, don't read the internet.  They hate you.  Don't read the internet, see?  And he said, don't worry, they hated me, too, you know?  Is it the X-Men freaks that just didn't think you were worthy to direct this movie? 
[03:47:00]  I mean, I don't think no one's good enough.  They feel like it's theirs, and you're like, look at this, I'm reading this, make sure  you thank Brett for turning Wolverine into a pussy.  Like Brett said, all right, I want Wolverine to be a big pussy in this movie.  No, I think it's, look, I try to go for, I knew some people were going to say that,  because I went for a more emotional movie that you cared about these characters.  And I don't think he's a pussy, he's slicing and dicing a lot of people in the movie, but 
[03:47:30]  you know, everyone has their opinion.  Each person, these are fanatics.  These people are obsessed with these characters.  Tell me about it.  And if you don't do exactly the way they saw it as a kid, the comic book, because when  you grow up with something, you have a special kind of passion for it.  Yeah, yeah.  They go crazy when you change the littlest thing.  Is it true that Wolverine does a scene with Heath Ledger in this film?  Yeah.  Broke back X-Men.  I got a question for you, too, because you directed a lot of really, really big music 
[03:48:00]  videos.  One problem I've had with the MTV Music Awards, how did you feel a couple years ago when  Johnny Cash's Hurt lost to Justin Timberlake?  You know, I wasn't following it, but I love Johnny Cash.  I think Johnny Cash is cool.  I mean, Justin, look, who knows why these awards are ridiculous, first of all.  I mean, I did the biggest video ever, Jessica Simpson, These Boots Are Made For Walking.  Yeah.  And we didn't even get a nomination.  So who knows why? 
[03:48:30]  Maybe we missed the deadline.  Jessica told me last night she thinks that we're going to get nominated this year.  I said, I thought we did the video last year.  Dude, what you lost in nominations, you made up for in boners.  Exactly.  That video, Jesus Christ.  I didn't like it.  The shorts were a little too short.  He looked a little too hot.  You guys didn't notice that Jessica Simpson said that to him last night.  Yeah.  You want to say anything more about that?  How great is this guy's life?  I know.  You know, in the middle of the night, she rolled over and she told me. 
[03:49:00]  Just good friends, right?  Jess gave me a ring.  Her dad was there at dinner.  It's a little awkward, isn't it?  Yeah.  How many times did you get caught looking?  A few times.  I love this guy.  Yeah, you're all right, Brett.  Thanks a lot, man.  Great talking to you guys.  Good luck.  Good luck, Benner.  X-Men, the last stand in theaters now.  All right, Brett.  Thanks, man.  Bye.  Cool.  How the hell do you go about that shit where they always say, I own the rights to that  or I bought that?  You ever see just some obscure guy gets a fucking arrow through his head and then it'll just 
[03:49:30]  be like, Fox owns the rights.  Yeah.  That guy.  What is that?  I don't know.  They make a fucking movie about it and stuff.  You know what's really cool?  Hearing a guy like that, just regular guy.  Yeah.  He's not one of these pretentious, I shouldn't say this, I need to keep an image or something  like that.  The guy's just talking about, you know, broads.  You know what's funny, too, is when you make that much money off a movie, usually if  you get trashed on the internet, no matter what level you're at, you're like, fucking  out.  See? 
[03:50:00]  It doesn't matter.  But $120-something million, you just, eh, I guess, you know, they hate me.  Yeah, they hate me.  So Jessica Simpson was calling me last night.  It's just like, you're so fucking a fuck.  But still, you know, the last guy told him, don't read the internet, because it'll piss  him off.  And you know damn well, he looks, and even though, when he, that five minutes that he's  alone, not banging supermodels, he's probably looking, going, this motherfucker, I poured  my heart and stole it in this fucking movie.  No one has.  Fuck yourself.  Wolverine's a pussy. 
[03:50:30]  Killed five people in the first 20 minutes.  Answering under assumed names.  Yeah, no one has thick enough skin.  No one.  No one.  That internet will just.  Doesn't matter who you are, the internet will.  Fuck you up.  Maybe I'll see him dollar signs, because he sounded really, eh, you know, I guess.  Well, yeah.  I was talking to Bobby Kelly last night, we had dinner, and he was saying that someone  e-m-e-byspaced him, and it just enraged him.  He wanted to buy a ticket to fly to Ohio to just bite this guy.  And he said, Bob, bro, because the guy trashed him.  I mean, Bob was very funny when he was on the show last time, and the guy trashed him.  So Bobby wrote back, and he called him a faggot, and then the guy called him out because 
[03:51:00]  he misspelled faggot.  Of course he did.  Bob is a dummy.  F-A-G-G-I-T.  No.  No, F-O-G-A-T.  Oh.  Bob, you could be.  Fogat?  The dumbest person I know.  He called him a bad 70s fan.  Listen, Fogat.  Yeah, he called me that on the internet.  Faggot.  F-A-G-I-T.  He literally spells it the way it sounds.  That was that time when he first had his website, and people were trashing each other 
[03:51:30]  so bad that people were going on under assumed names.  So he's trying to be this different character with the same spelling mistake.  It was like fingerprints.  He might as well have like a webcam.  And he just said, my name is Luis Faggot.  He just said, Bobby, everybody knows this is you.  I'm knocking on Bob.  Letters in the middle are capitalized.  He really is a dope.  Bob, you're as stupid as they come.  Accidentally hits the cap locks, and then every first letter is a small one, and the rest 
[03:52:00]  is capitalized.  Oh, yeah, totally.  Fucking Dexter Manley.  All right.  Can we go home?  Wow.  How time flew.  We have more show to do.  No.  No, we got so much.  You know, we have, let me say, we have work to do.  I got to look at houses today.  Houses?  Yeah.  Where?  I'm going to try looking again.  Where?  Manhattan.  That's not a house, my friend.  I know.  That's not a home.  Okay.  It's not a home.  I know.  I'm tired.  But I got to look. 
[03:52:30]  I got to look to see what's up.  I'm going to buy the rights for Jimmy Day.  Can we just go home?  Eight bucks.  I'm on that.  Eight bucks.  What?  You can take a break first.  We ain't taking a break first.  We're going home.  Yeah, Erox.  Stop trying to boss everyone around with your Amon Gert hairdo.  You guys figured out.  We're going home.  Fucking Rudolph Hess.  Shouldn't you be making a lampshade?  Fuck off.  He actually said we could take a break, then come back, and then go home.  And then leave.  No.  So we're going to sit around through a break for nothing. 
[03:53:00]  We go home now.  You come back after the break and babble, and then go home.  What commercial?  What are you running?  A commercial for the gold you're selling that you pulled out of teeth?  That was very funny.  I was reading an instant feedback.  Look, even though it grazed me, I'm laughing.  I didn't even get the full brunt of that joke.  I love Hulk Hogan and Ope and my dad.  Why did I do a really bad German accent and spoil the fun?  By the way, Bill Burr is going to be at Caroline's June 15th through the 18th. 
[03:53:30]  Mm-hmm.  212-757-4100 for tickets.  MySpace.com slash Bill Burr.  Bill Burr asked me if he's getting the emails he sends me, or if I'm getting the emails he sends me.  Because there's another guy out there.  He goes, it's Greg, G-R-E-G, dot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm such a moron.  As opposed to your home phone number.  Which is 6-3-1.  Anyway, yes, I did get your latest idea on my BlackBerry. 
[03:54:00]  It's too far?  Well, yes, it is on many, many levels.  It's a little icy potential death.  Yeah.  So, like, not that it's a high potential of death, but there is a potential of death.  I actually was reading this going, I like this idea.  And then I went, wait a minute, someone can die.  I didn't know that was fatal.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the problem.  Food poisoning could be fatal.  Sam, we've got to find the source.  Jack Klugman.  Of course. 
[03:54:30]  Perfect.  Dead on.  Here's the idea.  Opie, this one might be too disgusting.  I just wrote that so you'd read the rest of this email.  Yesterday afternoon, I put a doggy bag of food on top of my rental car.  It was sitting in the sun as I was fishing for my keys, and I started to think about how the food would go bad  if I left it there.  Why, if one were to wait long enough, the food would become inedible and begin to smell?  This is when I began to think of your show.  I know you've had eating contests on your program before, but have you ever done an extreme eating contest? 
[03:55:00]  You round up the usual band of idiots, then place a mound of rotten food in front of them.  And I liked it.  That's so much worse out loud.  I actually liked it to this point until you really got into it in the next paragraph.  Then place a mound of rotten food in front of them and let them have at it.  Last one to puke wins one of the new XM radios or tickets to some ONA event.  Ah, decent idea.  Another direction you could take it would be to bill it as Opie and Anthony's common man celebrity diet.  Most people could be in the shape that celebrities are in if they could afford a personal chef. 
[03:55:30]  Look at that waif of a man, Anthony.  He's got to throw an insult at me in his little idea email.  Trying to keep it light, that's all.  Light.  Uh, where are we here?  What the hell?  Okay.  But the common man, the working man, can't afford such luxury.  But with the ONA celebrity diet, weight loss is easy.  You eat a plate full of rotten leftovers, you get food poisoning, and you're guaranteed to lose five pounds over the next 24 hours.  No sit-ups, no cardio, no personal trainer. 
[03:56:00]  Then you bring in the creeps, you weigh them, and have them chow down.  You bring them back the next day, looking like death warmed over, you re-weigh them, and have Big A, Twitchels, etc., tape their testimonials.  I like the fact that this contest, where they're eating bad food, it usually takes like eight hours for food poisoning to hit you.  Well, that was the one glitch where it would have to take until the next day.  I'm in Ontario, California, I got nothing to do, you know?  It's a good idea, but the problem is, uh, someone could die. 
[03:56:30]  It could be a little too dangerous, sure.  Yeah, yeah, it could kill somebody.  Speaking of dangerous, we want to give away AIDS next week.  Yeah, somehow.  We're working on it.  Big AIDS giveaway.  I've been walking around just going, AIDS, we gotta give away AIDS.  I'm the AIDS.  I'm muttering to yourself, trying to...  I was muttering to myself.  Well, there's kind of an idea there.  It's the 25th anniversary of AIDS next week.  So on that day...  Wow, time flies.  On that day, we wanted to give away AIDS. 
[03:57:00]  That's where we're at with this idea so far.  Do you think AIDS will be in a Bennigan, and they'll all be clapping their hands,  happy, happy birthday?  Happy birthday to you.  25, AIDS?  Yeah.  25.  Looks great for 25.  Yeah, really.  AIDS can last that long, like everybody else.  Magic Johnson's on.  Where are they...  Like, what date are they picking?  Why is it that date?  Oh, because they traced it back to the monkey.  That's the day the guy fucked the monkey?  That was the day that somebody fucked a monkey. 
[03:57:30]  They went into a hut and saw a penciled-in date with monkey on that fucking...  on his calendar?  It was a story.  The CIA put it in a crop duster, and they flew over the village.  Oh, and then they marked the date down and told everybody.  Yeah, that's right.  That's next week.  It's either June 5th or 6th, what day?  It's June 9th, Jimmy Day.  Jimmy Day, yeah.  What a coincidence.  When is June 5th?  Monday?  What day is today, the 1st?  It's great if that's your birthday.  Got to share it with AIDS Day. 
[03:58:00]  Exactly.  So we want to give away AIDS.  What does that mean?  We don't know yet.  We don't know.  We don't know.  We'll figure it out.  Maybe...  We're clever people, right?  It's supposed to be.  Well...  Look at Jimmy Day.  Well, I...  Look at Jimmy Day.  All right.  We're out.  Yep.  Done-ski.  Maybe you could do an anal bleach out there.  I like a deep, dark asshole.  Do you?  Yeah, girl.  This one girl I used to talk to had a really deep, dark asshole, and I just fucking couldn't 
[03:58:30]  get enough of looking at it.  Why dark?  I don't know.  It was just naughty.  It was clean, though.  It was very clean.  Yeah, it was just a fucking deep, dark asshole, and I loved it.  You kind of need the same...  No.  Maybe a little darker, but nothing...  Fucking deeper.  No, nice.  You have like a pasty ass to offset it, to make that asshole stand out.  No, regular.  This was a dark one.  This was fucking stained.  Oh.  This was a port wine asshole, and I loved it.  I loved it. 
[03:59:00]  I loved it.  Oh, God.  I guess that's how we end today, huh?  Yeah, let's get out of here.  Let's see how this comes out.  All right?  They're right there.  All right, here we go.  I got a break.  I'm going to put it up.  Oh, this is nice.  Oh, girl.  This is a story about a man, and he always was so lonely at night.  But his voice was rowdy. 
[03:59:30]  You could hear it all through his train station.  And I'm going to sing this one.  This is about Tippy Toe Tommy.  Let's go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  Oh, we go.  It's late at night.  And now you have nowhere to go.  And the cop says to me, hey, you smell bad. 
[04:00:00]  Get out of here.  And he says, and you don't have an angel.  And he said, and you don't have an angel.  And he said, and you don't have an angel.  And he said, and you don't have an angel.  Shelter me from the falling rain.  You have bones.  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain.  That's just a little piece. 
[04:00:30]  Here's your life.  Don't put it on.  I'm over.  Not to pass.  I'm over.  We go.  I'm over.  We go. 
[04:01:00]  Let's go.  We go.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. </pre>
