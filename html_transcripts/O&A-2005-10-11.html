<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts and crew, including Jim Norton (fresh from an appearance on Jay Leno's show), engaging in their characteristically vulgar and offensive banter, targeting each other and the show's production.  Norton detailed his LA trip, recounting travel mishaps and his experience on Leno, which he found surprisingly edgy compared to his perception of Letterman's show. He described accidentally drinking Leno's water and his interactions with other guests, including Keira Knightley. He also discussed a challenging stand-up set at a Latin night and his pre-show nerves.  Listeners called in, many focused on an alternate show intro featuring Bill Burr impersonating Norton and others, which the hosts played.  The conversation shifted to the Yankees' recent loss, with offensive commentary about the game and announcers, including a controversial first-base call.  The hosts discussed a new publicity photo featuring various guest hosts' faces superimposed onto Norton’s.  There was speculation about the Bali terrorist attacks.  Further discussion revolved around Norton's experiences on the Leno show, including the style of humor and his interaction with Leno himself. The segment closed with more joking and insults amongst the hosts, mentioning upcoming guests including Audioslave. Listener-made movie trailers based on the show were also referenced.

The next segment began with nonsensical banter referencing Whoopi Goldberg and unfounded speculation about Indonesian terrorist events.  This transitioned to a New York City subway terror alert, with a live report from Todd Connor in Times Square describing increased security. The conversation shifted to the "Assault on the Media" contest on opanthony.com, focusing on No Filter Paul's leading entry, his outburst on Fox News with Greta Van Susteren.  The hosts described Paul's appearance and the contest prizes.  Further discussion of the subway alert followed, with the hosts expressing skepticism and theorizing that such alerts aim to instill fear. Norton, calling from LA, mentioned receiving concerned calls. Opie discussed his recent Pottery Barn furniture purchases, leading to humorous commentary about his apartment pest problems—initially mice, escalating to rats, and culminating in disturbing nighttime ceiling noises.  Norton revealed his involvement in opening a new restaurant in Huntington with his brothers, and the hosts brainstormed names. Several callers shared their experiences with household pests (Justin with plague rats, Eric with raccoons, and Pat with moths), with Opie recounting his own moth-killing spree.  The show then covered a police beating in New Orleans, analyzing different accounts and video footage, prompting discussion about police brutality, racial profiling, and police-citizen interactions.  Norton again mentioned his Jay Leno appearance. The segment concluded with a discussion on the dangers of high-voltage batteries in hybrid vehicles, prompted by a news report, with the hosts sharing their experiences and ending with a homophobic, humorous song about Steve and his hybrid car.

The subsequent segment showcased the movie trailer contest.  Laszlo's entry, filled with profanity and references to Jim Norton, was the first shown.  Many listener-submitted trailers featured crude humor, excessive profanity, and references to the show and its personalities. Technical difficulties were addressed. One trailer satirized talentless female radio co-hosts and included a tasteless Holocaust joke from a Tara Reid impersonator. Another, "Steve from Yellowstone," contained incoherent dialogue. The hosts and guests judged the top three entries. The show then transitioned to an interview with Audioslave. The conversation covered their Cuban concert (65,000 attendees), the challenges of securing permission, their political views, post-Rage Against the Machine careers, and personal anecdotes, including Chris Cornell's connection to Andrew Wood and the creation of Temple of the Dog.  They discussed the US embargo on Cuba and their observations about Cuban culture.

The Audioslave interview continued in the next excerpt, starting with a humorous anecdote about maritime camouflage using mirrors.  The discussion focused on their tour, their live DVD filmed in Cuba, their setlist, and the creation of Temple of the Dog. Cornell discussed Mother Love Bone's influence. After Audioslave’s departure, Al Jorgensen recounted getting married at Graceland.  The hosts speculated about Cornell's physical attributes.  Listener feedback on the Audioslave interview was discussed, along with a manager’s alleged connections to Fidel Castro and photos.  The Cuban embargo was debated.  The segment shifted to a Michael Jackson "publicity misstep" with the *Billy Elliot* cast, Norton's Leno appearance (pay and gifts), Anthony Cumia's sidewalk driving incident, and his "outraged white guy" persona. A brief appearance by Ron from the *Ron and Fez* show preceded discussion of upcoming guests. The show closed with discussion of the *Wildcats* soundtrack, Norton's future, a listener's death dreams, and Fez's subway fear.

The final segment began with a darkly humorous conversation about a deceased uncle and disrespectful grave actions. Listener calls followed: Snapman discussed the "good luck bro" curse, Jerry praised the show, and Joe requested "Free Bird." The hosts discussed their lack of planned content, promoting Nathaniel's comedy show at Caroline's and comparing his abilities to his assistant, Harry. A contest and a *Variety* magazine article were mentioned. A call with Rob, the PA, promoted foundrymusic.com, described as "powered by a potato," and the Audioslave DVD. The segment ended abruptly.

[00:00:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Very nice. 
[00:03:30]  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zilch and I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable asshat.  And these dummies that work for us.  And these dummies that work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby. 
[00:04:00]  Always laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the quality?  He rocks.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  The show is a disaster.  If you have any poo, fling it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  It stinks and I don't like it.  We don't need our damn machines.  We've got to welcome Jim Norton back to the program.  Hello, exactly.  Exactly.  And the phones just like took off.  Yes.  Welcome back, Jim.  Welcome back, Norton.  Welcome back, Jimmy.  And Jimmy just got here.  Literally two minutes ago. 
[00:05:00]  He walked in the studio.  Gave us all a great big hug.  You know, we was all proud of you being a hero in the war and all.  It's like homecoming.  It certainly is.  I'm not going to lie to you.  We're all in the office going, well, is he going to come in bitching, you think?  I'm like, how could he come in bitching after that great set on Leno last night?  As I was coming in, we listened to a travel report and the guy said it's five minutes delayed  to Lincoln Tunnel.  Ah.  Like, oh, I'll be in easily.  And there was like a 30 minutes delayed to Lincoln Tunnel. 
[00:05:30]  Of course.  So I'm screaming in the car and the driver's trying to go, actually, and I'm telling Ben  I want to bite this guy's face.  It was really awful.  And I wanted to come in in a good mood.  Well, that's what happened.  And then Ben gets off the phone with you and is like, he's fired up.  He's pissed off.  He's all pissed off.  Hey, dude, there's a lot of traffic.  How about that collision?  The Yankees?  All right, you know, they're calling.  He was all happy this morning because of the Yankees.  Bastard.  You know, we've got to go right to the phones because they're calling us out on something  and now we're going to look uncomfortable in front of Jimmy. 
[00:06:00]  Roger, go ahead.  Hey, welcome back, Jimmy.  Thanks, Roger.  Hey, what happened to y'all's other intro you had?  What intro?  We only play that one day.  I know what you guys said.  You all go play it for us.  What intro are you talking about, sir?  What?  I'd sure like to know.  Well, Jimmy's replacement and Jimmy's just filling in for him.  Well, everyone's calling us out on this.  Let's go to Mike.  Hey, Mike.  Hey, what's happening, boys?  What's up? 
[00:06:30]  Hey, what about the other intro?  You know, the one with the one that Jimmy's sitting in for today?  What intro is that, sir?  I'm not aware of that intro.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah, Jimmy.  I hate to tell you the news, but the boys made up a new intro.  We only played it once.  Oh, yeah, but, you know, and they said they were going to play it for you today when you came back,  but apparently somebody forgot to bring their nuts with them when they came to work.  Sir, was it featuring more of my stuff? 
[00:07:00]  Is that what it was?  Is that the big surprise intro?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Just get them to play it for you if they got the balls to.  All right.  And by the way, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  Well, I guess we might have redid the intro for one day as a goof.  What?  I don't want to rain on this parade.  We're all happy and hugging.  Even Anthony hugged Jimmy.  And I don't hug anybody.  I've known Anthony for 10 years.  I don't think we've ever hugged.  No.  Actually, we've got to update.  It's up to 11 years now. 
[00:07:30]  Wow.  But you hugged Jimmy.  That was the first time with our clothes on.  As a matter of fact.  We've never actually hugged face to face, either.  Would you like to hear the show intro that we did?  All right.  Well, this is what we were going to play for you, but we figured we'd start off on a positive  note today.  Ah.  Here it is.  Opie and Dopey.  Two guys that hate each other.  Just shut your mouth.  I hate that.  Shut up. 
[00:08:00]  Don't be unkind.  Shut up, bitch.  Oh, very nice.  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Bill Burr, and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zilch, and I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio?  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable ass. 
[00:08:30]  These dummies that work for us, you guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby.  Always laughing in the wrong places.  Hey, Ben, where's the coffee?  He rocks.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And then Steve is a piece of garbage.  And he's stinking.  Ugh.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  The show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Do you have any poo?  Sing it now.  I can't even look at Jimmy.  I can't even look at him.  Why?  That's great.  How funny is that?  I gotta say, though, Bill's Ben is not good.  No. 
[00:09:00]  Bill does not do a good Ben.  A couple times I couldn't tell if that was him or me when he's gone.  He stinks with the music.  I'm like, wow, that was a really good me.  He very much enjoys your whole, I want to spit in your face.  He says the anger comes right through the radio.  You just feel it.  And then there was something else we were doing while you were gone, Jimmy.  You know our publicity photo?  They made this for our one year on XM Satellite Radio.  It's a blown-up version of the publicity shot we signed when we were out and about.  And now we kind of just replace your head. 
[00:09:30]  With whoever's in there, that's fair enough.  That big, bloated Bob Kelly head is stuck on there now.  Over your head, so.  Oh, gee.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Doorknob.  Doorknob, what's up?  Nothing.  I just want to say and tell the guy it's...  Well, hold on.  First, hey, Opie.  Hi, Ant.  Hi, sweet kids.  Welcome back.  You're back.  Thank you, fella.  Damn it.  It's birthday.  Not birthday.  You got to say it right. 
[00:10:00]  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Okay.  Other than that, that's it.  I'm punching out.  No, you're not.  You're crashing.  You're crashing out.  In flames, my friend.  Yeah, a lot of people excited that Jimmy Norton is back.  I don't even know where to begin with you, Jimmy.  I'm very...  I couldn't sleep on the plane.  I was so excited.  I really was, oh, like a little kid on Christmas morning.  I was Arthur Ancy.  Everyone else is asleep because it's a red-eye flight, and I'm wide awake, just with my stupid  computer up listening to tunes.  I was so happy.  You probably had the staff on the plane all the nervous because you wouldn't sleep. 
[00:10:30]  Like, what's he up to?  30 pisses I took.  I was up every three minutes going to the bathroom.  I was really an awful little patient customer.  We got to back up just slightly.  Obviously, Jim Norton was on Jay Leno last night and then took the red-eye right after  the taping.  Yes.  He called me right after the taping, and it sounded like Jay Leno was really into what  we're doing, what you're doing.  It seems like he's slowly becoming a fan of the show, Anthony.  That's great.  It's just a matter of time before we have Jay Leno on our program.  Oh, I'm certain of it. 
[00:11:00]  I'm certain.  And Jimmy was very excited, and then last I heard, you were on the way to the airport.  So pick it up from there, man.  Um, not much to tell, really.  I got on the plane and flew.  I watched.  Yeah, it flew.  No crashes.  And I watched the Yankee loss in California with a bunch of Angel fans.  Oh, no.  But they're just so noncommittal.  It was like a mild applause.  Really?  Yeah, it was like one of those little smattering pitter-patter applause.  So it was like, fine.  I was just outraged. 
[00:11:30]  I was annoyed by the way the Yankees played, and some of those calls were ridiculous.  But, you know, if they played good ball and they made those ridiculous calls and lost  because of it, that would have been one thing.  But they played like shit.  Yeah.  They weren't talking about, oh, here is Bernie's last appearance in a uniform.  Good.  Got to see him pop one more up.  And then Matsui just stranding people, just leaving him there with his pop-ups.  A-Rod, nothing. 
[00:12:00]  That double play.  I wanted to sink my teeth into his fingers when he grabbed it into that ninth inning double play.  I was so irritated.  Unbelievable.  Just a waste of me staying awake last night because now I'm fucking exhausted.  Well, fellas, they had a good year.  Part of me is glad, dude.  It's not like they spent $208 million on the team.  That's why I'm kind of happy.  You know what?  Because Brian Cashman, I really can't stomach.  So I'm kind of glad. 
[00:12:30]  It's like, you know what, stupid?  That's what you get when you trade away your young prospects and you go for 45-year-old  pitchers who won't take pictures with little broken-down toilets of human beings.  That's what you get.  Welcome to the lean years, boys.  Yeah.  I've been living the lean years for many years with the Mets.  Can anyone please help me out with that stupid fucking call down the first baseline?  Robbie Cano?  What the fuck was that?  Can you explain to the people that went to bed early, like myself?  Well, Robbie Cano was running to first base and he stayed right on the baseline and touched 
[00:13:00]  first before the ball got there.  And he was out.  He struck out and the catcher missed the ball.  So he's allowed to run.  He can run.  And the ball was thrown.  It hit him, I think, and bounced off him.  But they called.  Oh, it didn't hit him?  No.  No, it hit the guy who was playing first, right in his glove, after he had touched first  base.  I couldn't for the life of me fathom.  He was supposed to have been on the other side of the baseline. 
[00:13:30]  It was an awful call.  Because the eyes in the back of his head are supposed to see where that ball is being thrown.  It's like, oh, he went out of the baseline.  The guy was right on the stripe, hit first base.  And then to try to hear, what's his name, who, Joe Buck, or who the hell is doing, trying  to babble about it.  I just wanted to put my foot through the television.  They're all Yankee haters, these guys.  Was it a big play? 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  It was a pretty big play.  Pretty big play?  Pretty big play.  And you're right.  They are just Yankee haters.  Because every two seconds, it's like, well, the Angels could really put it away this time.  Right now.  Oh, if they smash it out of the park, this one's going to be completely out of reach.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Thanks for the reminder.  They should be Yankee haters.  I didn't notice that.  Well, Joe Morgan, you want the rest of the country to like the Yankees?  Yes.  They're crazy.  No, but the announce is supposed to be impartial.  Just announce the game.  The rest of the country wants Angels, White Sox, not Yankees, not Red Sox. 
[00:14:30]  I had to listen in California with the Angels home team announcer.  Oh, boy.  And he was calling Vladimir Guerrero Vladdy, and the other guy Fig something, what's his  name?  He was calling him Figgy.  And Figgy had a double.  It was really awful.  Little pet names.  Really awful.  Play rule.  Major League Baseball official rule book.  In running the last half of the distance from home base to first base while the ball is  being fielded to first base, he runs outside to the right of the three-foot line or inside 
[00:15:00]  to the left of the foul line, and in the umpire's judgment, in doing so, interferes with the  fielders taking the throw at first base.  Again, like I said, I don't understand what the fuck that means.  The guy's running.  His back is to the ball.  It wasn't like he pulled that goddamn, what was that, an A-Rod move last year when he  went completely out of the baseline.  You shouldn't be able to run at first base any way you want. 
[00:15:30]  And if you get beamed in the back, hey.  Right.  Why not?  Just all he's trying to do is beat the throw.  You get first base and a bruise to the back.  But regardless, that wouldn't, you know, they played like shit.  That collision was great.  That gay sex we saw out in the outfield was just fantastic.  Two men couldn't hold off any longer.  They had to just fucking pile into each other.  Looked like me and Jim in the studio this morning.  Right.  That was a little awkward.  You don't know how to hug a man. 
[00:16:00]  Hey.  Wow.  I guess I should take some lessons.  It was quite awkward to see you hug Jimmy.  You know what it is?  I lift my leg up and point my toe.  You've got to.  I do a little breakfast at Tiffany's hug.  There's a lot of happiness and a lot of hugging and Ant knew he had to do it.  I did the hug in the backpack.  Yeah, you did a little back pat.  Pat.  Back pat.  Battle.  What?  A little pat on the back.  I was going to go for the handshake hug thing. 
[00:16:30]  What do they call that?  There's a name for that.  Urban and awful.  Homo.  Is that where you just grab the hand and pat the shoulder?  There's actually a name for that.  The little bump?  The chest bump thing?  It's a hug, shake, a shug maybe they call it.  I'm serious.  A shake hug?  They combine the two and they call it a shug or something like that.  Christian from the Red Sox Nation.  Hey guys, take it from a Red Sox fan.  There's always next year.  Oh, stop.  I don't want to be commiserating with a Red Sox fan.  I don't need Red Sox fans to teach me how to accept a loss. 
[00:17:00]  I know they played like dog crap.  What happened?  Well, I'm just using a big game pitcher.  That's the one in there.  All right, enough of that.  Who cares?  Thanks.  Well, you guys are...  It's over, Johnny.  Exactly.  No more baseball season now.  Who cares?  The cashman should be shot and I can enjoy my week here.  I was kind of happy they lost because now people in New York could watch me on Leno last night  without waiting for the end of that dumb ninth inning.  Can you imagine?  Can you imagine if everyone was still watching the game instead of a little Jimmy on Leno? 
[00:17:30]  Let's go to Dave in Connecticut.  Hey, Dave.  Hey, guys.  As a Red Sox fan, I just want to say welcome to the shit.  This happens to us every single year.  I don't want to hear any more shit from you Yankees fans.  I'm done with it.  Dude, are you trying to, like, rag on me because you're whining?  Oh, no.  I'm not whining.  No, no.  Not at all.  See, now, this is just called a little bit of retribution.  It's now after the year 2000.  You guys, it's done. 
[00:18:00]  The curse of the gay rod exists.  You guys got swept.  That's all right.  No, it's all right.  No, it's all right.  In the 20th century, we have a win at the World Series, at least.  All right.  In the 20th century.  Good.  Well, how about the 21st century?  Yeah, exactly.  You did get one in the 20th century.  We all know that.  Yeah, we got a couple in the 20th century.  In the 21st century, we got one now.  Hey, one per century.  You guys are doing great.  Yeah, better than you guys are. 
[00:18:30]  The Mets did okay.  Yeah, the Mets.  We have one or two.  No, we have two in the 20th century and none in the 21st century.  There you go.  All right.  Thank you, Rob.  We're moving on here.  Let's say hi to Rob on Long Island.  Rob, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Jimmy, I'm so happy you can make it back on your birthday today.  Oh, thank you, man.  What a coincidence, right?  I know.  But Jimmy, Anthony, let those shining references rain today.  Ah, yes. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, yeah.  The whole time Jimmy was gone, Anthony, I didn't hear you say one shining reference.  And it was.  I don't think I did.  And it was wonderful.  You didn't miss them?  It was like an evidence.  Why didn't anybody call and correct me?  That was a wonderful few weeks without that shining crowd.  You can't just have some other person in the seat and share something like that.  Especially while I'm on flight 237.  We don't even remember who sat in that seat for the last three weeks. 
[00:19:30]  No idea.  I think we had like 12 replacements.  You want to do third mic, Doc?  Yeah.  Patrice Cook.  He was great yesterday, actually.  Oh, he's hilarious.  Yeah.  He had a lot of fun with Patrice.  I saw his HBO special, too, yesterday.  Oh, did you?  Finally, I got it on demand.  And God damn, is he funny.  He is a funny motherfucker, that Patrice.  Hell, yeah.  I haven't seen anything.  I saw Louie's, and that was the only one I saw.  I didn't see Billy's. 
[00:20:00]  I didn't see Patrice's.  Billy's is really funny.  I saw Billy's.  I saw Billy's.  I saw Billy's.  Billy's was really funny.  Billy's was great.  I have an earthquake.  I didn't see earthquakes.  No.  The only one I saw was Billy's, I guess, at this point.  Yeah, Patrice's is really good.  I'll see Patrice's tonight.  He just gets where women just fucking hate him.  The women in the audience are just like...  Oh, what is he...  He's talking about relationships and how, you know, guys just don't want to hear any shit  from the women, and he pulls it off.  We don't like you?  Is that the one we were talking about? 
[00:20:30]  We don't like you?  We don't like you.  We don't like you.  He goes through this hypothetical situation of a girl got in a train accident and had  her vagina removed.  Like, what you would do to keep your man?  He goes, after like the three-month period, because you can't just leave a bitch after  she loses her vagina in a train accident.  Hysterical.  And he's like accepting answers from the women.  You know, what would you do to keep your man if you lost your vagina?  And they don't know, and then they just start yelling out shit like, I used a mouth,  or I still got my ass.  And he goes, see, women are talking about yourself like you're just a collection of 
[00:21:00]  holes for us.  I'm supposed to think more of you?  Really funny shit, man.  I can't wait to watch that.  Let's say hi to Brian in Virginia.  Brian!  Good morning, boys.  How are you?  All right, Brian.  Hey, man.  I just wanted to say welcome to Bill Burr's replacement.  Happy birthday.  Thank you, fella.  And you have a great time.  I loved you, okay?  Thanks, buddy.  We were talking about the fact that we get a lot of new listeners every day.  Absolutely, yep.  And there are people who have no clue who Jim Norton is. 
[00:21:30]  Yep.  They think that we just have this rotating stable of comics, and you're like the new  guy.  Or there's people who know me for one week on the show, and then know Billy for two  weeks, and Patrice for a week.  I mean, there's people who probably had a week of XM before I left, so yeah, I thought of  that, too.  Yeah.  People are just coming aboard every day.  It's nuts.  And then we got that DirecTV that hits, what, the middle of November?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  That's going to be huge for us.  Brian from posthores.net.  Hey, Norton, how did Leno's water taste last night? 
[00:22:00]  We should get into the Leno thing.  I can't believe I did that again.  Oh, that's right.  You did it last time, too.  It was a complete accident.  Because it's right in front of you.  Yeah.  It's like on the corner of his desk, and your water is kind of on a round table in front  of you, or something.  And it's a longer reach, it looks like.  I don't know.  I've never been on the Leno set, Jimmy.  Well, it says guest two and guest one, all the other cups.  Oh, it does.  But Jay says, tonight show, I noticed as I brought it to my lips, and I didn't realize  it wasn't mine until he scolded me.  Yes, he did.  And then he threw it away. 
[00:22:30]  That was a great moment.  And I was telling you guys before we came on, my mind, the minute I drank out of his cup,  I'm immediately telling him, I want to tell him, don't drink out of that, you're going  to start losing weight quickly.  But he got such a good laugh from the audience, the moment, I just decided against it.  I'm so glad I decided against it, too.  But that wouldn't have been appropriate.  The AIDS joke.  Yeah.  I was thinking of trying to find a hip one real quick, without saying it, of course.  Did you just want to bury your face in that chick's lap next to you?  Absolutely.  You made her so uncomfortable.  Oh, she was hot, man.  It was great. 
[00:23:00]  Is that what they do now?  They do it on purpose?  They put a hot chick next to you, so you can just look like a fucking creep.  Yeah, I think so.  Whenever a girl is under 25, who's just going to be disgusted by my presence, Dakota Fanning's  next.  Well, Jimmy, walk us through this whole thing, man.  I've been working on the set for probably two weeks.  I thought I was going to do it next Monday, so I'd have a week in New York to work out,  do four sets tonight.  In LA, I'm trying to work this out.  You're getting like one set a night. 
[00:23:30]  The improv was great.  Some of the clubs were great.  I did have a problem with one woman who I'm going to try to get on the air tomorrow because  I really, I want to take a dump in her eyeball.  She wouldn't put me on her awful stage, and she knew I was doing Lino because she was just  being a whore.  So I got the set worked out, and I was nervous, man.  I was like, this one I was kind of nervous about because I didn't feel prepared.  I was bombing horribly all week.  It was dying.  This is why I don't do ethnic shows.  Friday night, there's a great club in LA called the Ha Ha Cafe.  It's like a little New York club.  Awful name.  Agreed.  Agreed.  Awful name.  But it's actually a great club. 
[00:24:00]  But Friday was Latin night, and I didn't know.  Uh-oh.  And they bring me up, and just the stares on those awful faces.  As soon as I walked up, whenever your intro, they say like, Barigua!  They all clap.  I was like, fuck.  Oh, you just know you're going to the firing squad, right?  And they don't get irony at all.  Like, I walk up, and I'm like, how are you?  Nobody answers, so I use my standard line of, what did I suck on the way up?  Yeah.  Nothing.  Nothing.  How did that not get a laugh, you fucking idiots?  Of course, I didn't say that. 
[00:24:30]  Were they wearing the hairnet and that flannel shirt with just the top button?  No, it wasn't that bad.  I wouldn't have gotten out.  No, there was a couple of white faces.  Better make me laugh, Izzy.  You gotta just throw some Spanish into your act.  That's all they want.  Yeah, maybe.  One line of Spanish.  Call yourself the Punisher!  That'll do it!  No?  No, he's terrific, though.  That guy.  Those sketches get me every time.  Yeah, that race does do that.  Fuck you.  Good point. 
[00:25:00]  So, you did Latin Night.  It was awful.  Horrenda.  Dude, I bombed.  But I bombed on every white show I did, too.  I was on a death roll.  Why is that?  Couldn't get the set right.  I couldn't figure out the opening.  I kept opening with the photo stuff.  I could not get the opening.  I couldn't get the closing.  None of it was making sense.  It was just bombing everywhere.  And I've done all this stuff in New York.  And I finally, Saturday night at the improv, it clicked.  It just worked.  And then, um...  Wow, that's odd how that happens.  Weird, man.  All of a sudden, it started to work for me. 
[00:25:30]  And then I went out and did four last night or three last night.  And then Monday it worked.  But I was really nervous about this.  Yeah, it looked great.  You didn't look nervous at all.  And then you just arrive at NBC.  I mean, walk us through it, man.  You get there, the car picks you up.  I want to hear about this.  It's a car.  Opie, the car.  The car.  There's a black, um...  It's like a nice town car.  Oh, man.  A little water in there.  Because you're a fancy person.  Fancy man.  Right.  The man's a fancy vehicle.  Of course.  They pick you up at 2.30 for a 3.15 arrival.  I'm living in Los Feliz.  It's like 10 minutes from the studio, which I didn't know.  And, uh...  You get there and they bring you back and you relax for a little while. 
[00:26:00]  And then, uh...  In your dressing room?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You have a dressing room.  Are you with the other celebrities?  No.  Keira Knightley was in the dressing room next to me.  Of course.  Can't have her with him in the same dressing room.  Well, she showed up like five minutes before showtime.  Really?  Yeah, of course.  You know, fucking Ernest Eager.  I'm there like, you know, 2.30.  Can't he stay around?  Nervous asshole.  They're still unloading the seats.  Yeah.  The fucking killers are all passed out, face down and vomit somewhere.  And I'm there eating fruit alone in the dressing room.  They don't even have my name thing on the door yet. 
[00:26:30]  That's how you know you're early.  When the Spanish guy actually brings the fruit in while you're in the dressing room.  That's great.  Hi, here to do a little comedy, sir.  Oh, okay.  So you're just pacing around in this room eating fruit?  Just hanging out, eating fruit.  I got a sandwich and, uh, was there any, did you have anyone there with you?  Well, no.  Nobody had showed up yet except for, uh...  No, I mean anyone you brought.  You bring up your posse?  No, stupid Yoshi.  And Yoshi has the worst friend, his friend Isaac, who's a comedian, who's a nice guy, but he's just awful. 
[00:27:00]  He's just looking at his flannel shirt.  He's just awful.  And, uh, they just look awful together, two of them there with their cameras.  I wanted to smack both of them.  Hanging out in the dressing room, just draining all life and fun.  But they came later, and, uh, David, my manager, and Jonathan came.  Sure.  Uh, yeah, it was cool.  All four of us just hung out, but for a while, I was by myself with Bob and Ross, the guys that booked the show.  Yeah.  And, uh, you know, then you go out on the stage, they're like, we're going to go show you where your cue is.  And they're also worried about upsetting Jay, who's the nicest guy on earth.  Really?  Because I'm going out...  Well, that's their job, yeah. 
[00:27:30]  They, yeah, I get it, they would worry they're going to piss them off, but they bring you out just to, there's a little C on the stage, which I guess stands for comic.  It's in the middle of the thing, and they go, you just walk out.  And then, so, of course, Jay is out there, and he says, hello, and welcome back, and he's just a great guy, man.  He makes you feel comfortable.  Yeah.  Right.  And then, uh, he'll come in the back in the dressing room and hang out and talk to you for a while.  And then you go out and do the show.  How long does he talk to you for?  Uh, usually about 10, 15 minutes.  Seriously?  Yeah, I don't know how he is with the other guests, but with the comedians, he really has a comedian thing.  He really likes the comedians, man. 
[00:28:00]  And we were talking about the whole, like, Letterman thing, and I told him how he played the clips, and he was like, oh, like, you seem like he was cool with that.  And he's like, yeah, I don't know why we have the reputation of not being edgy.  He was, like, kind of surprised.  Like, I don't know why people have that kind of thing attached to us.  Yeah, I was telling Jimmy before the show, I had to do my own research, but now I'm with you.  Leno's much edgier.  Much edgier.  Because I've been doing the DVR lately, and I've been, you know, watching some monologues and stuff before the show in the morning when I'm drinking coffee.  And Letterman's doing jokes about how big the rats are in New York City and how the hookers are hanging out in Times Square. 
[00:28:30]  And I'm like, dude, man, you're so out of touch.  No one would think there's hookers in Times Square.  And every time I mention this, you get an NYPD cop saying, hey, they're still down there.  But you wouldn't think that.  It looks like Disneyland.  We've all said that now.  It has completely changed.  And Letterman saying that the hookers in Times Square, it's like, what?  Wow.  Why don't you take a walk one of these days and see what's going on in the city that you're broadcasting from?  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  I mean, you know, I'm sure he gets a limo in, does his show, and limoed right back out to Westchester, wherever the hell he lives.  He doesn't know what's going on in this city anymore.  And then you go to Leno, and he's doing edgy material about what's in the news.  Yeah, the Pakistan and New Orleans.  He told me that joke in the dressing room.  He was really happy with that one, because I was like, dude, it's just great to see.  I said, I was so happy with the Michael Jackson thing.  He went right after the race.  And I said, Letterman did a joke about this.  And he wouldn't ban him out of Letterman.  I mean, they know each other a long time.  Yeah.  But he's like, oh, tonight we've got a good one about New Orleans and Pakistan. 
[00:29:30]  He was just like, any other comment?  All excited, yeah.  He was just so happy that he had a really topical edgy one.  It was just great to see him get all happy about the earthquake joke.  He's just a kid when it comes down to it, you know.  He's just a comic who wants to just wreck people's day.  Yeah, you're right.  So then what do you think when you're in the dressing room, the show has begun?  You watch it on a little monitor, and you want to watch how the lead guest does.  You want to see what the audience does.  But the way they told me, this is the way it works, Bob and Ross told me that the way 
[00:30:00]  it works is people tune in for the lead guest, and they actually come to the studio for the  music guest.  That's the way it normally works.  So the killers with a band, as we're driving in, I'm seeing all this young audience, which  I thought, this is great.  Very few old people.  I mean, they were all kind of young, you know, 20 years old.  Yeah.  And so Keira Knightley was very good.  I mean, the people seemed to like her.  I really didn't listen.  I just kind of watched for the reaction.  You don't want to like musical guest Tony Bennett.  Yeah, no.  Oh, no.  They thought they almost put me on tonight with Clint Black, and Bob and Ross was like,  no, no, not him with Clint Black. 
[00:30:30]  Thank God they think about shit like that.  Oh, so they think that out.  That's smart.  Those guys do.  Yeah, yeah.  They're animals, man.  They booked a couple of years, and they know.  It just wouldn't have worked.  Because the producers sometimes don't think.  They're just trying to line up the weeks of shows.  Now, this was your third time on Leno.  So you're sitting there.  The show has begun.  You're in the dressing room.  What's going through your head?  Are you more relaxed than the first time, obviously?  Yes and no.  I actually left the dressing room because my managers and Yosh and Isaac were hanging  out.  So I just walked by myself and went over my act in my head real quick. 
[00:31:00]  You go over the cue card to the guy.  He comes in.  He goes, all right, what's your cues?  So I put the idiot lines that I'm going to need, and I know where he's going to be standing.  And Stuttering John, obviously, is now his lead-in guy.  So we talked for like 15 minutes, just about L.A. and whatever.  But I walked up by myself just to go over my act.  I was a little bit tense about this one because I just hope this set works.  What do you got?  Like your intro lines to each bit you're doing?  Like the first one was like sinuses. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Oh, that's all written down for you?  Well, whatever bullet points you want.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just thought stars or whatever.  And I needed it once this time, too.  There was something after the sinuses that I didn't remember where I was going to go because  I kept switching the order.  So I just kind of glanced down real quick.  And I was like, okay, there it is.  It's cool.  I knew it was there.  Yeah.  And I went into it.  Wow.  Oh, that's very interesting.  That would be too nerve-wracking for me.  I'd lose my mind.  I'd just run off the stage naked, like pulling my hair out, just screaming in horror. 
[00:32:00]  It'd be so nerve-wracking.  I couldn't do it.  Yeah.  Well, let's give a big round of applause for Anthony Gumiya.  Just run backstage crying.  Baton Rouge, Anthony.  Baton Rouge.  Oh, yeah.  I just got to call up some L.A. hack to replace you.  Replace me because he ran off screaming naked, ripped his clothes off like oil can. 
[00:32:30]  I just went crazy and ripped my clothes off.  That's great.  Say hi to Kevin.  Kevin in Connecticut.  What's up, Kevin?  Hi, guys.  Who's this Jimmy Norton guy?  He sucks.  Kevin.  Hello.  Kevin.  Did you guys hear?  Oh, you guys didn't see it.  He said Openy and Anthony.  Yeah, Jay has a weird thing with their name.  It's very hard to say.  It's like, you know what it is?  It's because you're going for the end.  It's like Open Ant.  It's like Openy and Anthony.  It's just a...  He did it the last time.  It's like Bush saying nuclear.  Yeah.  You guys joke about that all the time.  He did it. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, he plugged the...  God, he plugged us like three times last night.  Yeah.  I thought that was cool as hell.  Yeah, he did that too.  He was great, man.  All right.  Well, we got some audio from the Tonight Show appearance.  I haven't heard it.  It's great.  It starts with an O&A plug before headlines.  Let's listen to this real fast.  Welcome back.  We got a good show tonight.  The lovely Karen Knightley is here.  She's in the new movie Domino plays the kick-ass bounty hunter.  Yes.  You know, I always use such a sweet little English frail. 
[00:33:30]  Now she's, whoa.  Oh, she's terrific.  A very funny comedian, Jim Norton.  You'll probably hear this guy if you listen to Opie and Anthony on the XMRE.  Yeah, they're like the hottest guys on radio.  And the very funny comment from that show.  He'll be here.  How cool is that?  Ooh, Jay.  And he corrected himself.  Yeah.  He did say open and knee, but this time he stopped himself and then said it right.  Yeah.  It's like a verbal text.  That is so cool.  Yeah, it's great, man.  And the hottest show on radio, whatever you said.  That's great. 
[00:34:00]  I like that.  He's talking about us?  That's right.  He certainly is.  Yes, he is.  Through our little contact in the Hollywood there, Jimmy Norton.  Now look, man, it's people love the fact that you guys, let's just say, are wrecking other  people's day.  Yeah.  You don't know how many people in the business love you guys for that, that you are just balls  out.  Rumor has it that Leno's paying attention.  Let's just put it that way.  Nice.  That's right here.  Right here, thanks. 
[00:34:30]  It's a great plug, man.  Going out to Hollywood, learn the comedy business.  Yeah.  We're hearing thanks.  Anyway, let's do your stand-up here, huh?  All right.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of people out there that probably didn't stay up for the Leno last night.  I mean, a lot of people did, but then there's others that didn't.  I don't know.  I just put myself in a bad position.  You just described everybody in America.  Some people were up.  Some people weren't.  I was too angry to laugh.  Really?  I went right to sleep. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Well, we all watched it this morning in the office.  Yes.  And we were very, very happy and very, very proud of you there, Jimmy.  Thanks, man.  And in case you missed it, here it is.  All righty.  The next guest, very funny comedian, starring in his own one-night stand comedy special on  HBO, which premieres October 21st.  Every morning, you're going to hear him on the Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio.  That's the how to show the rest.  Please welcome Jim Norton, ladies and gentlemen. 
[00:35:30]  Thanks, everybody.  It's good to be back.  How are you?  I'm actually spending a lot of time in L.A. now, and I'm lonely, man.  I don't meet a lot of women.  And one of the main reasons is I have really bad sinuses.  You don't realize how disgusting you sound until you see that look on somebody else's  face.  I don't even realize I'm doing it.  It's like, hey, can I get you a drink? 
[00:36:00]  I don't know what turns a girl off more is the sniffle or the swallow that comes right  after it.  I spent about two hours today looking at photos of myself.  Not good.  I've never photographed well, and I finally realized why.  It's because cameras are accurate.  I'm not a good smiler. 
[00:36:30]  Like, some people can just smile on cue.  But for me, it has to happen naturally and organically.  Like, you know, maybe you're out in a mall.  You see a very old person tumble face first down an escalator.  Only natural a smile should pop out.  But when somebody tells me to do it, I think it's my shame, but I just kind of smirk and  slouch.  And I don't mean to do it, but someone's like, smile.  And I always go.  Every time I'm photographed, I look like an athlete should be visiting me in a hospital. 
[00:37:00]  I always hate when I'm online talking to a girl in a chat room and she's like, send  a picture.  I'm like, well, that's the end of this conversation.  And I hate, like, the chat room lingo, like that little abbreviation people use, LOL, laughing  out loud.  Are you? 
[00:37:30]  Because it used to be a natural expression to kind of make a mechanical conversation seem  more real.  But now it's this, like, anchor at the end of every lame, uncomfortable online moment.  I use it myself.  You're trying to get somebody to talk dirty.  You got to throw LOL in there just in case they get angry.  Like a woman says something totally innocent, like, ah, that sucks.  And you type back, well, sucking isn't always bad, LOL. 
[00:38:00]  Just in case she gets mad.  You're like, no, I'm just laughing out loud.  I mean, I'm not sweating with my pants around my ankles typing left.  I'm creepy.  I'm not a good flirt.  My idea of flirting is walking into a really crowded club and standing an inch behind a  girl and tickling the back of her arm and whispering, coochie, coochie, coo.  Some things are creepy only in context. 
[00:38:30]  Like, I happen to lick my lips to moisten them.  Sometimes that's acceptable.  Other times, disgusting.  If you're talking to somebody and they're like, hey, how are you?  And you're like, yeah, I'm a little tired.  That's not bad.  But it's a different story.  If you're talking to someone and they're like, yeah, my daughter just left for school.  And you go, really, how old is she? 
[00:39:00]  I'm insecure around women.  You know what part of my body I really hate, besides my torso, neck, and chin?  My feet are a genetic abomination, size seven and a half, triple E width.  That's almost a perfect square.  Normally, the only way to get feet like that is for a duck to impregnate a Lego person. 
[00:39:30]  And I had a foot injury recently.  I twisted my ankle and I didn't want to go to the doctor because I had this irrational  fear of the medical profession.  Like, I'm going to go for a twisted ankle and find out I have syphilis.  But I've always had really, really bad pain in my feet.  So I finally went to see somebody and he goes, oh, I see the problem.  Your left leg is a little longer than your right leg.  Oh, that's a relief. 
[00:40:00]  Thank God it's not a muscle pull.  Nice to know it's only a mild skeletal deformation.  And now I'm completely self-conscious.  Because you know you have something wrong with you.  You feel like everybody else can see it.  So I'm talking to a woman, but the whole time I'm talking to her internally, I feel like,  oh, can I buy you a drink?  I forgot my burlap mask with the eye hole cutting it.  Thanks a lot, buddy. 
[00:40:30]  Appreciate it.  Thank you.  Yay.  Jimmy Norton getting huge laughs on Jay Leno last night.  They were lovely.  Huge laughs.  Are you kidding me?  A lovely crowd.  I think we snuck your set on opianthony.com and thondramusic.com.  Yeah, I haven't seen it.  It'll stay up there until NBC, you know, tells us to knock it off.  Yank it.  I don't think they'll mind.  Or they'll sue us.  Nah, they've been cool to us so far, right?  Look at that.  Hilarious.  Good job.  Goddamn Jimmy gets better with every appearance.  Oh, thank you, guys.  Hysterical. 
[00:41:00]  Eh, the rave reviews.  So who's out of it from Harry from the Ron and Faze show?  You know, sometime this morning we're going to have to just catch up, you know, we're  going to have to do a little catch up with Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  Is he still around?  Harry?  Oh, yeah.  He is still around?  Oh, yeah.  There's been problems with Harry.  Of course.  Yeah, we'll get into that a little bit.  Okay.  Uh, well, then you, uh, walked over to the couch and talked to Jay Leno.  Yes.  So let's listen to this.  Oh, very funny stuff, but that's okay. 
[00:41:30]  I'll get another water.  Oh, is that yours?  Oh, don't worry about it.  I'll just throw this away right now.  Sorry about that.  Oh, no problem.  Well, congratulations.  You got a TV series.  Tell me about that.  Uh, it's actually, it's a sitcom on HBO called Lucky Louie.  Uh, I'm not the star.  Uh, but I have a great part.  I play, like, a really creepy, ill-informed pervert.  Wow.  It's, I mean, every week my script comes, it just says, show up. 
[00:42:00]  I'm not a good actor.  I mean, on this, I'm fine.  Oh, you're terrific, by the way.  You really are.  Oh, thank you.  But I don't get nervous doing stand-up.  It's so weird.  Acting is like, I tend to panic when I'm acting and I overdo it.  Yeah.  You always tell, like, when a comic's nervous acting because my eyes bug out. 
[00:42:30]  It's like, where are you going, Bob?  Oh, I suck.  Sometimes I read little stage directions in parentheses.  Where are you going, Bob?  Looks at Bob.  No, no, I'm fine.  And the hardest part of acting, I've always found, is listening.  It's really hard to, like, listen.  That's how you connect in the scene, is you listen. 
[00:43:00]  But I'm so worried I'm going to forget my dialogue.  Like, I don't listen to the other actor.  So there's no connection.  The whole time they're talking, all I'm thinking is, not my turn, not my turn, not my turn.  And then when it's my turn, you know, I bug out.  Act, act, act, act.  Not my turn, not my turn.  Well, it sounds like you have a fine career ahead of you.  Well, Jim, very funny.  Again, once again, I'll be on Anthony's show on XM Radio and, of course, on One Night Stand  on HBO on the 21st.  Thanks so much, guys.  That was great. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, a couple things.  You drank Jay's water.  You've got to see the video for that.  It was priceless.  And Jay went with it, and he got a huge laugh.  And then they offered us some of mine, and he turned it down.  Yeah, no thanks.  And could you see me lick my lips after I looked at her and said, you're terrific?  No, I didn't see that.  Yeah, because I did a call back from the actor after I said, you're terrific, and I  licked my lips.  I didn't know if that would show up.  It was really creepy.  She didn't know what to do.  She was squirming, and she looked like she was going to move over completely to the next 
[00:44:00]  seat, and then realized, wait, I can't do that.  I'm on TV with Jay Leno.  That's the only reason she didn't move away from you.  Did they have to put out the foot thing for your foot, that little platform?  No, but the last time I was there, I actually tried to put my feet on.  They go, I'm going to move your feet, and they actually slid it in.  I was like, shit.  I like the platform, Jay.  That's for when little kids come out that could spell all the president's names and stuff.  They put them in there, and they slide that little piece of wood out for them to stand 
[00:44:30]  on.  Perhaps a tot who'd won the spelling bee.  Right.  Little Jimmy's feet are just dangling like a puppet.  Two little fat Doc Martens.  Nowhere to be placed.  And then, just to finish this up, at the end of the show, Jay gave us another plug.  Oh, did he at the end?  I think so, yeah.  Come on in, you guys.  Sarah, Jim.  I want to find my guest, Jim Norton on HBO and the Opie and Anthony show.  Thank you very much, Karen Knightley.  Stay tuned for Conan.  Coming up next.  Good night, everybody.  Wow.  I didn't even catch that one.  That's great. 
[00:45:00]  That's a friend taking care of his friends right there.  That is nice.  Jimmy didn't have to get the Opie and Anthony plugs in.  Trust me.  With the whole HBO thing going on.  Well, that was...  Yeah, it was enough to plug.  No, please.  Because your HBO half-hour comedy special is on Friday the 21st.  Yeah, we won't be here that week, though, either.  I was unfortunate we won't.  This show was off that week before.  We're like the faithful wife of...  That's what we are to Jimmy.  The faithful wife that just stays there, steadfast, supporting her man. 
[00:45:30]  And Jimmy's out there just fucking hot chicks.  Like, he's got the HBO.  He's got the Leno.  Things like that.  He's just fucking...  But we're here.  Yeah, did you have a good trip, dear?  You know, we're here with dinner.  And we're barely holding on.  You know that.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  We're one more thing he has to plug from...  Oh, I know.  ...been dropped from the list of plugs.  We're the last plug.  It's still there.  It's right there.  I...  We gave you the best years of our lives. 
[00:46:00]  I really do leave you with a load in you and a house dress on.  And then fly off to the palm tree west coast.  All it can take is a small role in, like, an Adam Sandler movie or something.  Oh, and it's over.  And it's like, well, I got the HBO thing and the movie.  Sorry, guys.  Something's got to go.  Something's got to go.  It's been fun.  Oh, there she is, backing away from Jimmy a little bit.  Jimmy licking my lips.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, all right.  Creep, I look like it.  Is that a still shot or the video?  Still shot.  Is that online?  Yeah, it will be.  Yeah, we're going to throw the still shot online of you licking your lips after you said 
[00:46:30]  that she's lovely or whatever you said, whatever the line was.  Could you smell her, cunt?  She wore a larder top.  She's beautiful.  She's the one from Pirates of the Caribbean, right?  Yeah, yeah.  She's really...  Caribbean or whatever?  Yeah, Caribbean.  She's...  Actually, Caribbean.  Caribbean.  They say it both ways.  I don't know.  It can be said both ways.  I've been practicing since you've been gone, Jimmy.  Oh.  I speak much better.  I think I say Caribbean.  I say... 
[00:47:00]  Caribbean.  Yeah.  Pirates of the Caribbean.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  She's very nice, too.  Lovely gal.  Very friendly.  If you know what I mean.  Oh.  I was going to ask her out on the show.  Really put her on the spot.  Oh, wow.  Put her on the spot.  Yeah.  There wasn't enough time because they let me...  My panel wasn't...  They didn't know if it was going to be three minutes, but they told me it was going to  be two, so I went a little long on the stand-up.  Yeah.  They told me, go long if you want.  They were great.  We should play The Killers today from Leno last night.  If we could get that into break.  They were good.  I love The Killers.  They're one of the hottest bands out there right now. 
[00:47:30]  Why don't we take a break?  We're just getting warmed up.  It's homecoming for Jimmy Norton.  He's here the rest of the week, and we couldn't be happier.  We've got lots to do.  We've got to catch up on a bunch of things.  We've got Audioslave coming in today at 9 a.m.  That's going to be a huge deal for us.  Also, Anthony, the movie trailers that we've been doing.  We'll explain this to Jimmy after the break.  Oh, my God.  We've got to explain that to Jimmy.  Is this what The Shining one is?  You've been gone this long.  Well, we have...  I don't know.  We had about 20 of them that came in. 
[00:48:00]  No, it's not The Shining.  You know which one I mean, though, right?  No, yeah, but no, it's not that.  Pay attention.  I don't know.  I get...  You don't have your MiFi working yet, do you, in L.A.?  You haven't listened to one goddamn show since you've been gone.  Listen...  We've been following your career while you've been out in L.A.  Yeah.  The only thing you can do is figure out how that MiFi works.  You guys may look at yourselves as the wife, but I still look at you as the hot chick.  And when you know there's a freckled red dick getting stuck into your hot chick, you don't 
[00:48:30]  want to hear it.  That's why we love you, bro.  That's hilarious.  And he's a Red Sox fan.  Anyway.  Anyway, the Shining thing was funny, and that is on opianthony.com where they redid the  Shining trailer with...  Yeah, it's a visual thing, though.  Yeah, it really is.  We tried it on the radio.  It didn't really work.  But they turned the trailer around to make it look like a...  Romantic comedy. 
[00:49:00]  Like a romantic comedy, sure.  So, no, the listeners did make their own Opie and Anthony movie trailer.  Oh, nice.  It started with...  Have you heard the Laszlo movie trailer?  No.  Holy shit.  I haven't heard it.  What the...  Who the...  Who the...  Who the hell are you?  I just...  We used to do a radio show with you.  No, I'm catching up.  All right, here's the...  We'll go to break with the Laszlo movie trailer.  No, we'll save that, actually.  We're just going to go to break, and we'll figure it all out in a few minutes here.  I want to know why... 
[00:49:30]  I got the audio, by the way.  Why is Al-Qaeda or El-Cater or whatever...  What is it with Bali?  Did, like, some Al-Qaeda guy have, like, a bad vacation there or something?  I mean, what the fuck?  I thought it was, like, a vacation, like, tiki torches and shit.  I mean, like, what are you thinking, like, blow up Senor Frogs and fucking Cancun next?  There's some kind of huge terrorist activity down there, over there.  Just...  I don't know why, either.  There's a lot of Muslims, is what it is. 
[00:50:00]  A lot of Muslims down there.  Ramadan stars.  What's that, Derek?  Derek knows that?  No, there's...  It's supposed to be one of the, like, second-largest Muslim nations or something.  Yeah, there's a lot of Muslims.  It's like the Muslim Hamptons.  Is it?  Yeah, that's how you vacation there.  You know what I love about this show?  If you have a mic in front of you, you could be an expert on something.  Yeah, I agree.  It's like Derek is an expert on...  That's very high concentration of the Muslims down there.  I know, because I've been studying this for the last ten years.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to get back to the horsefuck video. 
[00:50:30]  Right.  That's what I love about...  That Encyclopedia Britannica commercial from the 80s.  I was a kid doing a research report on space.  Yeah.  That fucking thing.  He knows a little bit about everything, too.  I listen to all the talk shows, and I watch the pundits on TV, and I'm like, what makes  him an expert?  Just because there's a camera on him?  A microphone.  That's it.  The microphone.  Derek had confidence.  I don't know shit.  I don't know shit.  I don't know shit.  I know everything.  I know everything.  Right here.  I'm just an asshole again. 
[00:51:00]  I'm just an asshole.  I don't know shit.  I don't know nothing.  Fucking Einstein.  Right here.  I'm Alvin Einstein.  The confidence Derek had.  Oh, let me crank this mic up.  Oh, let me tell you what I know.  Piniest J. Whoopi.  Piniest J. Whoopi.  The gross national product of Bali.  There are times we discuss shit, and I'll say something, and we don't know.  Mr. Whoopi.  We don't know.  Why are there so many terrorist events in Indonesia? 
[00:51:30]  Don't open that closet.  Gee, Tennessee.  First, let me get out my globe, and I'll show you.  A lot of rag-headed animals seem to live down there, Tennessee.  They like blowing each other off.  Strapping bombs to themselves, and whoopi!  High body count.  They can't stand the Christians.  Mr. Whoopi, you're the greatest.  Mr. Whoopi and Anthony.  Next, here we go. 
[00:52:00]  Too many men.  Too many people.  Making too many problems.  And there's not a lot to go around.  And you see, this is a lot of confusion.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  This is the world we live in  And these are the hands we're given  Here's the new let's start trying 
[00:52:30]  To make it a place worth living in  Todd Connor joins us live from New York Times Square.  Todd?  Hey there, Greta.  Mayor Michael Bloomberg is spending his day defending his actions  To make the threat public and also to flood the city's subways  With thousands of police officers and extra security  Saying he would rather err on the side of caution  Of course, city's subways also being rather cautious today  Reporters reporting countless abandoned bags and other suspicious items 
[00:53:00]  This bag found on train tracks in Midtown  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program  That is the leader as far as the assault of the media contest goes for October  Good friend of the show, no filter Paul  He does Jim Norton's t-shirts  And he looked like a raving lunatic  Because he is  On Fox News on Friday night  What a horse's ass  During Greta's old TV show  He lost his mind 
[00:53:30]  He really is a limey boob  The video's great  It's up on opanthony.com  You're going to have to beat that  To be the winner of the assault on the media contest for October  They added prizes, Anthony  We got the MiFi  We have Dinner with E-Rock  We have the World Poker Tour Season 2 on DVD  Ministry of Sound Stick Axe Music Mixer  What the hell is that?  That sounds pretty cool  And finally admission to the Opie and Anthony show  Where you hang out all day 
[00:54:00]  And check out what we do every day here  Alright  Oh, a one year free subscription for the MiFi  That you'll win as well  Nice  And No Filter Paul is in the lead  The video is just priceless  It looks like he just lost his mind  He looked like a crazy person  From like 12 Monkeys or something  12 Monkeys  In the teeth, Bob  In the teeth  Well, there were 12 Monkeys  But they were all trying to put their dick in his wife's mouth  She's now admitting that it really wasn't rape in that bathroom stall 
[00:54:30]  That she just wanted black cock  Yeah, she just wanted to suck him off  She just wanted the black one  That was a great assault, by the way  Paul looks nuts  Yeah, like a lunatic  They had to pull him  They had to pull him out of the camera  It is definitely one of those clips where he looks like  It looks like one of those bad science fiction movies  And he's the guy that, like, they're coming!  They're coming!  Like, that crazy guy  Yeah, I really like that assault on the media a lot 
[00:55:00]  That's the type of face you see on somebody who's interrupting, like, 9-11 hearings  Yeah  You know what I mean?  The government knew, whoa, whoa!  All right  Did they?  Yep  Pictures of Keira Knightley naked  What?  Nah, the links don't work  Who is that?  Nick from Boston  You can't get anywhere with that  What are you doing to me, Nick?  From Boston  Hey, speaking of that story, the subway terror alert  It's done, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  After all the fear they gave us  Yeah, it wasn't quite as scary as first anticipated 
[00:55:30]  Jim, did you hear all about this in L.A., probably?  Yes, it was  It was a national story, obviously  Were you worried for us, Jimmy?  They were searching the baby strollers  Yeah, you didn't call your pals  Don't take the subway, guys  I was getting phone calls from all over the country  From old friends, family members  Oh, are you safe?  I know you live in New York  Are you taking the subways?  Something happened  I didn't know what it was  I really did  Something happened  I wasn't sure what it was  He's such a self-centered creep  No, no  You know what it is, babe  When you're out there  In the end, absolutely nothing happened 
[00:56:00]  You know, you guys gotta realize  Right  Nothing happened  Yeah  Now they're saying it was just a hoax  Yeah, they get this info from these clowns over there in Iraq  That they're holding prisoner  And they react like it's real information  Right  When it's just the guys, they're fucking with us  They're terrorists  That's how they terrorize  By either really blowing shit up  Or making us think that they're gonna blow shit up 
[00:56:30]  And then we get all like  Oh boy, you're taking the subway  It's more effective  What's up with the strollers?  It's more effective to scare us for four or five days  By saying something's gonna happen  Than actually something happening  Yeah  You know, if all of a sudden  Surprise, something happened  Oh, that sucks, obviously  Yeah  But, you know, the buildup of four or five days  Wondering if something's gonna happen  Is very effective  Right  Well  You know, when I'm in Pottery Barns shopping  And no one can help me  Because they're all panicking  Calling their daughters and sons 
[00:57:00]  And making sure they're not gonna take the subway home  That day  They did their job  Where were you?  You lost me in that story  Because I kind of got distracted  Yeah, there you go  You shouldn't say they were calling their husbands and wives  You should say they were calling their life partners  Life partners  You go to Pottery Barn?  I know  What's wrong with going to Pottery Barn?  Can't you pick me up a new robe on your way home?  This one's in tatters  I needed a lamp for my bedroom  And I needed a couple, like, throw pillows for my couch 
[00:57:30]  I'm starting to get furniture  A lamp and throw pillows  Yeah  Honey, don't go on the subway  I haven't left the house in weeks  Dude, you shop at Pottery Barn?  Did you or didn't you not get your rocks from Pottery Barn?  You're right, I did  Thank you  The rocks that I put down  Yeah  They got yellow ones now  I'm gonna get the yellow ones 
[00:58:00]  Did you get  You got a lamp for your bedroom?  Yeah  Did you get, like, a night table to put it on?  No  Is your bed still on the floor?  No, no, no  Alright, you got a real bed now  No, I'm doing good  Yeah  I got an end table  I got a lamp  I got a...  You could definitely timeline this whole thing  I could graph Opie's furniture buying with his relationship  Yep  Because no chick is gonna put up with a bed on the floor 
[00:58:30]  No light in the bedroom  And no dresser  All that shit  No, I have  You still had your matches on the floor  I have lights in the bedroom  Oh, you were living like Clemenza  I wanted a little newspaper over his belly  I want a little lamp near the bed in case you want to do some of that reading  Ah  So the lighting's a little softer  Oh  Than the overhead lights that are quite bright  And, well, you gotta get up to shut off the overhead light anyway  This way you can lean over and click 
[00:59:00]  Alright, since I last talked about my apartment  I got...  What have you got?  Two end tables, okay  Two end tables in the... where?  In the living room  In the living room  That's either side of the couch  I got... yeah, I got a DVR  Uh-huh  Or I signed up for the DVR  So I'm recording programs left and right  21st century  Nice  I got a lamp for my bedroom  So I can do some of that reading at night  Uh-huh  And then just reach over and go click, click  Instead of getting up and walking  That is very handy  Very, very convenient  Very handy  I also... what else did I get? 
[00:59:30]  I got a mattress pad for the bed  Ooh  Um... what else?  One of those quilted ones that go over the top?  The mattress pad that just just... I don't know  Makes it nice and soft  Soft like a little quilted thing?  Yeah, yeah  You lay down and you just feel...  Yeah  That's very nice  And then I got...  Oh, I got one of those rain shower heads  What?  One of those big oldie time shower heads?  Yeah  They're like... look like a UFO  A bunch of holes in the bottom?  Yeah 
[01:00:00]  Like you're in a rainforest?  Yeah, you feel like you're taking a shower in the rain  You gotta have high pressure for that though  I got some nice pressure  Yeah?  Yeah  That's nice and it swings out kind of?  Yeah, it's nice  It's big  It's like, you know, it's big  It's almost as big as like a frisbee  Okay, I gotta ask...  Above my head  I gotta ask you this  Yeah  Who installed it?  I did  Bullshit  Swear to God  You installed...  You used a tool?  It's very easy  Let me tell you about tools  I'm learning about tools  You're learning about tools 
[01:00:30]  I'm learning about tools, Anthony  Little wrench  Did you go into a creepy basement?  Fuck no  To find the tools?  No, no, no  I went to Pomodoro  And what did you get?  The whole starter kit?  Comes with the screwdrivers?  An adjustable wrench?  Which for the people that are around the country  Is a restaurant that's featured in Seinfeld a lot  When it goes out on dates  Pomodoro  They always show the outside shot of this restaurant  Yeah  And I know Peter  He's the manager over there  He's a good guy  And he came over and installed your shower head 
[01:01:00]  Well, I...  No, no, no  I bought the rain shower head  And I'm like, hmm  I don't have a tool to install this  I'm thinking, wow  I might actually have to go and buy tools  Yeah  I'm like, nah  Peter's gotta have the wrench  So I asked Peter if he had a wrench  Because I'm not gonna use tools  On a regular basis  You should absolutely...  Every man  Everyone in possession of a penis and testicles  Should at some point  Go down to Home Depot  Or wherever  And get yourself a little toolbox put together 
[01:01:30]  With little wrenches and screwdrivers  And a Makita cordless drill or something like that  You got tools, Jimmy?  I have a couple of things, but not much  Because you never know when you might want...  And then you could have just turned the wrench a few times  And installed without leaving your house  So, you know, Peter gave me the wrench  It was old and rusty, but old monkey wrench  And then I returned it to Peter  I guess he's like a neighbor 
[01:02:00]  Oh, look at that  Here's your wrench, neighbor  So I'm on my way, I think  And it doesn't leak?  Nah, it's doing quite well  So wait, you took your old one off  And this one comes straight out  And kind of like hovers over you  And hangs over you  You don't have a rain shower head yet?  I never heard of one until you just said that  Come on  It's all the rage  Some hotels and stuff  Some of the hotels  They're big  It looks like a flying saucer  With holes in the bottom  So the coverage area is like a foot wide  Yeah, when you're showering in the morning at 5 
[01:02:30]  It's kind of nice to just kind of stand under it  It's a foot diameter  Like of just water pouring down  Instead of getting like just, you know, small  But how do you...  Let me ask you  Like mine points down my shower head  Do you just take that off  And put a new thing on that comes straight out?  It's so easy  I would have to see your shower head  I'm an expert at this now  Just to make a service call now  It's going to cost you, Jim  If you want me to come and do that for you  You know, I can do that  Did you have to use some Teflon tape on that?  Nah, nothing  No?  They've made this stuff easy  Yeah  I'm not going to lie to you 
[01:03:00]  It's very easy  But I guess I have something else to say about my apartment  Oh  The other night I'm sleeping downstairs  Java logs?  No java logs  I haven't seen a mouse in many, many months, by the way  Very good  The guy that gave me the electric mousetraps  You rock  Whoever you are  You absolutely rock  They work great  I killed like seven of those suckers  God  Something like that  Seven?  A total of seven, yeah  Wow  Your area is infested, by the way  I haven't seen one in a long time  But I'm going to... 
[01:03:30]  No, up that area of Manhattan  I read about it  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  Yeah, yeah  With mice?  Yep  Yeah  But I was sleeping  I think it was...  I'm trying to remember  Probably Friday night, let's say, okay  And I'm woken in the middle of the night  Oh  By noises  Uh-oh  And I'm downstairs  Did you grab your rapier?  Oh, wait, that's...  That's you  Downstairs  Woken, wide awake  And I'm listening to noises in my ceiling  So in between my ceiling  Yee-ee  And the floor upstairs 
[01:04:00]  Yeah  That crawl space  There's a party going on, man  Dude  Now, I've seen the mice  They're small  Really small  The mice cannot be making this noise  They cannot  You think they're big rats  They have to be  And I think they were doing some of that fucking  Making new rats  Yeah, because I'm reading this new book about rats  And they said if you live in Manhattan  It's almost a guarantee that you're within two or three feet of rats fucking  Really? 
[01:04:30]  At any given moment?  That's all they do is search for garbage and fuck  That's all rats do  And they say it's a guarantee  They're right under the sidewalk  They're in your walls  They're everywhere  Yeah  Everywhere  This book I'm reading is so creepy  It's got the heebie-jeebies  They look for garbage just to fuck?  Nah, they have to eat  And then they fuck  And when they're full  Then they go, well, you know  That reminds me of  Insert ethnicity here  But I heard  I heard this scampering 
[01:05:00]  Yeah  That went from one side of the ceiling  All the way to the other side of the ceiling  Woke me out of a dead sleep  I'm like, what the fuck is in between my ceiling  And the floor upstairs in that crawl space?  What is going on in there?  And this is the second time that has happened  Really loud  Really loud  Oh, boy  I have no idea  Now, how do you cure that?  I don't know  I can't even figure out how they would get in there  You could get a syringe of poison  And shove it through the ceiling 
[01:05:30]  Well, I can't wait to get out of there  I'm finally looking, Jimmy  You got it  You got to get out of there  I'm finally looking for a place  It's a nice place, just old  Yeah, it's time to get out of there  And I bought a restaurant with my two brothers  Since you've been gone  Look at Jimmy  It's in the restaurant business  Ah, sure  What did you buy, Louie's in the Bronx?  It's perfect  We're going to open up a restaurant in good old Huntington  Got an old-style toilet  With the tank and the pull chain 
[01:06:00]  The rats can nest behind it  Behind it  So what kind of restaurant?  I'm a silent partner  I'm not going to lie to you  I'm the investor, basically  My brother knows the business very well  And he's opening up a restaurant in Huntington  When he talks to you and you're like  What do I know about the restaurant business?  Come, I order a meal  That's what I know about the restaurant business  So, you know  Some things are  I don't have the steel-cut oatmeal and blueberries  Yeah, those asses on whackbag.com 
[01:06:30]  Talking about the restaurant  What we're going to be serving  What the name of the place should be  If you have a legitimate name for a restaurant  You really can help us out  Because we can't figure it out  It's got to mean something  And we just can't figure out a name  What kind of cuisine?  Like American, I guess  A little of everything  O-N-A's  That's right  Well, we're thinking of naming it after the show in some way  Yeah  Yeah, because, I mean  From a marketing standpoint  That'll, you know  Bring in a lot of the listeners  Sure  I have an idea  I'll be doing appearances there every Friday at the bar  Signing publicity shots 
[01:07:00]  Ah, great  You can do some stand-up in there  Yeah, why not  La Mata  That's not going to be great  Yeah, that's pretty much my role in this thing  So  Like La Mata  Hey, Kahlo, something happened  Hope you'll be all 50 years old with a big gut  And spill something clumsily on the senator's wife  Kahlo  That's me  Oh, is that great? 
[01:07:30]  Ah, you know  So  It's going to be fun  Yeah  My brother's working his ass off every day in Huntington  Go in and say hi to him  That's good  You've just got to be the financial end of it  And then you sit back  Yeah  It's going to be right next to Nags Head  Do you remember Nags Head?  Nags Head  Yeah, I do  Yeah, we're  Across from Lake Red and near Lola's  Yep  Okay  Kind of near the end of the street there  As you're heading out of town  So we'll see what happens  We're excited  Let's say hi to Justin in Texas  Justin 
[01:08:00]  Hey, how's the phone, guys?  Hey  Happy birthday, Jimmy  Thank you, buddy  Hey, Opie  Are there plague rats in your area?  Yeah  Plague rats  All right  Let's say hi to Eric  If you have mice  You might have more than you bargained for  Disease and death  Eric, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  You've got to stop crying about mice in the attic  I've had four raccoons in there this year  Me and my wife are sleeping about five, six months ago 
[01:08:30]  We hear the really loud scampering in between the attic and the ceiling  I go around the corner because it wakes my ass up  Eric, look  Were they trying to cut holes in the roof waiting for the helicopters?  Not those poons  Oh, Jesus  Eric, sounds like a little home invasion  There's actually a paw  There's a paw coming through the freaking sheet rock  It was trying to break into the house  Wow  Maybe it was a New Orleans raccoon  But I trapped it  I trapped it  And two months later  I got more in there  I trapped two more 
[01:09:00]  And I got another the other day  And it just keeps breaking in  It's unbelievable  This noise was so loud  It's definitely not mice  I was hoping they were rats  You think they might be raccoons?  I mean, this noise was really loud  I thought someone was running  I thought I had a burglar in the house or something  They were running across the upstairs  That's how loud it was  I don't think I've ever seen a raccoon in Manhattan  That's what I'm thinking  That's where  Oh, my God  You fail phone calling 101, sir  You fail  Do over 
[01:09:30]  Now you've got to take the test over  And everything  All right  Oh, my God  He wouldn't stop yapping  Here's how you do it, sir  It's talk, listen, repeat  Yeah  That's it  Like, we were commenting  He spoke  We were commenting on what he brought up  And he's moving on to subject two  And then three  I got a raccoon in the backyard  And we have these garbage things  And are you  I love great names  You know, I don't even have to go to the street with the garbage  You know how usually you drag your pails out there  My two pails 
[01:10:00]  Are in the backyard  Sunk into the ground  With these metal  Like hatch covers  Over them  Sunk right into the ground  I open the sliding glass door  I open up the hatch  Throw the garbage in  Shut the hatch  The garbage men  Come around to the back of my house  Open the hatches  Pull out these little pails  Go to the street  They're dressed in like tuxedos almost  And dump the garbage out  And put the pails back in  It's amazing  But at night 
[01:10:30]  I hear the hatches opening and closing  So, rapier in hand  I go to the sliding glass door  Turn on the backyard light  And there's the cutest little thief  Raccoon  Wearing his little raccoon mask  Standing up on his hind legs  Using those little hands  To eat our garbage  And it's adorable  I love the raccoons  You know, I'd rather have the raccoons  Going through my garbage  Outside my apartment  But it's the homeless people  Yeah  And they're not as cute 
[01:11:00]  Well, now they shower  Outside my apartment, too  So  How do they show  What, did you leave your shower?  We got an outdoor hose, I guess  A spigot?  But it's not mine  It's for the building or whatever  But the hose isn't attached  So they put their head  In between the nozzle  And the cement  How much room is there?  It can't be more than  I'm not kidding, Anthony  Eight inches  Eight inches of headroom?  And they're showering that way  Take the shower?  They're taking the shower  At least they're cleaning up  And then they go through  All the garbage  And throw it all over the place 
[01:11:30]  Every night  It's quite fun  Since we're talking about pests  I also have solved  The moth problem in the house  Oh, yeah?  Finally, last night  I found a box  With, as a listener  It said, bird seed in it  There's some, like, bird seed in there  To feed the birds in the country  But the bird seed  Was feeding the moths  This box was full of moths  So I just ran it outside  And then went on  The biggest moth killing spree 
[01:12:00]  Ever  It was the moth holocaust  In my house  Me, with a rolled up magazine  Killing anything that fluttered  I was running through the house  Whap, whap  Just smacking any moth  That moved  And then I went to bed last night  And still, moths  Like, ones I missed  But I'm clearing them out  They're going down in numbers  They have no more home base  I'm winning the war on the moth  Don't you hate moths?  I hate them  They're not pretty like the butterfly  Which is pretty little butterfly 
[01:12:30]  They're just annoying little chalk-covered things  Little dusty moths  Butterflies scare me  I don't know why  Is it that they're coming right at you  And then they kind of turn real quick?  Yeah, I don't know  There's something about the wings  That just creeps me out  I don't like anything that flies  You can't figure out where they're going  Really?  Yeah, they're just bothersome  You want to know where they're going  You don't like them  You don't enjoy the monarch butterfly  Old colorful  I'd enjoy the monarch butterfly  If I had a bad mitten racket  A lot of people saying 
[01:13:00]  It might be squirrels in my apartment  Could be  I'm hoping  Let's say hi to Chris the trucker  We'll move on to other things  Go ahead, Chris  Yeah, did little Jimmy Norton hear  About the fancy man  That won $100,000?  I certainly did  Yeah, our goodness  Won $100,000  You were around for that, no?  No, there's a way  But Eric is the same guy  I can tell nothing has changed  He certainly didn't waste his money  On razors and shaving cream  All right, we should do some news  The subway thread  We got the latest audio  Thread is over officially 
[01:13:30]  We're out of danger  We're out of danger  Thank God  Wow, good  Thank God  The mayor's on top of it  We're surprised this all happened  With an election pending  What a big surprise  Continued doubts about a terror threat  Now means fewer cops on the beach  Fox 5's Catherine Craig has those details  She's in Greenwich Village  Good morning to you, Catherine  Good morning, Lucy  And I guess it's somewhat back to normal  As normal as it ever gets in New York City  When it comes to the subways 
[01:14:00]  One thing you'll see less  Police officers patrolling  In and around the subway stations  One thing will remain  The random bag checks  But they will be on a smaller scale  After facing four days of intense security  Today's subway riders face less scrutiny  Knowing the NYPD is scaling back  I don't have any problem with it  I think the mayor is doing the correct thing  I'm fine with it  I think whatever is necessary  Should be done  Police had been focusing on searches  Of baby strollers and backpacks  Fearing remote controlled explosive devices 
[01:14:30]  They flooded subway cars  With officers and undercover agents  Investigators say they still have found  No evidence a plot would be carried out  The mayor insisted he did the right thing  By taking strong action  That they have been unable  To verify this particular threat  And since the period of the threat  Now seems to be passing  I think over the immediate future  Will slowly be winding down  The enhanced security 
[01:15:00]  Oh brother  Holy crap  The period of the threat seems to be  You mean the threat that really wasn't  Like he's not saying there wasn't a threat  The period of the threat seems to be winding down  Oh that period where there wasn't really  You know credible threat  Which is you know  I guess it's fine that he does this  But it really is going to hurt in the long run  Because people  It's the cry wolf thing  And I think the best time  To pull off one of these things  Is going to be right after one of these alerts  Because let's say  You're a bomber 
[01:15:30]  You have all the materials  You want to bomb the subway  They get wind of it  They do what they just did  Call down the police  Search everything  Are you going to go down there  In the subway  And try to blow it up  During that period of time  No  You hang out in your pad  In your terrorist pad  Whatever  With your explosives  What do they call it  In Batman  Uh  Hideout  No  No  The penguins hideout  The lair  The hideout  No  Where the bad people stay 
[01:16:00]  Where the bad people stay  Fuck  And he's always insisting that he listens  Yes  That's my big complaint with him  You don't listen  Listen to me  There's an example Eric  You would  What you would do is  Wait  In your hideout  Nothing's changed Jimmy  Sorry  Until they call off the threat  Because once they call it off  Like they said  There's less police  And the police that are still down there  They're not checking as much  Because  Eh 
[01:16:30]  They'll let that guy through  We've checked everybody before  The threats pass  And that's when you would blow something up  Best time  So they're just  In the long run  This is making it easier for them  You said it perfectly  Yesterday  Thank you  It's just going to come out of nowhere again  Yep  We're not going to have warnings  And then it's going to be  You know  This is what's going to happen  And then a couple days  Are going to go by  And it happens  It's just going to happen  Everyone was whistling  A happy tune  On a beautiful like sunny day  It's just going to happen  And that's the unfortunate thing 
[01:17:00]  About terror  Nice fall morning  September 11th was  Wasn't it  Right  Remember how bright and sunny  Right  And it came out of nowhere  That's when it happened  No one's like looking for it on those days  When you're looking for it  It ain't going to happen  I'm more worried today  Even though the threat has been  Taken away  Than I was when the whole threat  Was going on  Yeah  Yeah  I'm worried today  Now I'm a little shaky  Despite the scale bag  You can still expect to see police  In a lot of places  People will still  See a heightened level of security 
[01:17:30]  Still doing bag searches  Covering a subway system  A subway station  You know  We're not quite normal  Bus drivers though  Tell us they're not sure  If the security checks  Will ease up  For them  One driver told us  They're pretty much  Prepared for anything  One thing that has changed  Over the last several days  Once they get to a bus stop  A police officer may get on  Check their ID  Other documents  And they'll check if everything's okay  On the bus  Well there you go 
[01:18:00]  There's the latest  Pat from Munaki  Says  Moths  Night vision goggles  Who are you  James Gumm  Yes I do own  Night vision goggles  And I have moths in my house  I've got a card  I've got a card  Frederica Bimmel  That's funny Pat  Another big story  That we're all talking about  Is that beating in New Orleans  You saw the beating right  I did not see it  You did not see the beating 
[01:18:30]  I heard about an arrest  That was made  Of an unruly citizen  Who may have been intoxicated  That's all I know  As far as the facts go  Opie  What beating are you talking about  Someone was taping  A god damn pest  With their video cameras  And then the horse  Backed up his big old ass  Try to block the camera  The news camera  From videotaping the beating  Apparently there's another  Angle on this whole thing too  Where the horse isn't blocking it  And it really shows  That guy just being pummeled  Who is he an old guy 
[01:19:00]  Old black guy  Who's a 64 years old  Bunch of white cops  Come up to him  Story they have  The cops is that  This guy was drunk  Unruly  Resisting arrest  They had to tune him up  A little  Get the cuffs on him  His story  He hasn't had a drink  In 25 years  He was out getting cigarettes  He asked one of the officers  About a curfew  That has been in place  In New Orleans  At that point  They threw him  A sound thrashing  For no apparent reason  I think  The real story  Lies somewhere 
[01:19:30]  In the middle  I think  I can't possibly see cops  Call me naive  Even though it's  White cops and a black guy  I just can't see a black guy  Going  Excuse me officers  What time is the curfew  Oh boom boom boom  Let's beat the shit out of him  I don't see that happening  I just do not see that happening  I believe though  Something about  When he says  I haven't had a drink  In 25 years  Yeah  Of course I  You know I look at that  And I go  Something about that  That ring  I think there's  It doesn't lie in between  Something about that ring  Is true  Like he definitely 
[01:20:00]  Couldn't have been drunk  You don't lie about  Being sober for 25 years  But there's a point  Between asking a question  About a curfew  And being beaten  To have to get handcuffs on you  Something has to take place there  Did the cop try to throw him  Against the wall  Did he turn around  Like I never saw a cop's beating  Escalate from a question  To a friggin'  Life-threatening beating  There's usually  Something going on 
[01:20:30]  Where the citizen  Is not cooperating  Whether  Whether they  Whether the citizen  Feels it's within his right  To leave the situation  Or  Or he shouldn't be  Getting arrested  Or he shouldn't be  Having this cop  Mouth off to him  Or something  Something happens  Between there  It's not just  Hi  Oh my god  I'm getting a beating  Right  So what do you think it was?  I think that  The truth lies  In between somewhere  I think  He mouthed off  I think this guy 
[01:21:00]  Mouthed off  I think the cops down there  Are a little on edge  They're on edge  During Mardi Gras  We've been down there twice  And we've seen some things  Yep  And I think  They don't take any shit  They don't even  They don't listen  I mean  As soon as you mouth off  You're getting  You're getting beat  Patrice tried to explain it  To me the other day  And I still just don't get it  I asked  Why don't you just  Put your fucking hands  Behind your back  Get cuffed  Get brought down  And deal with it  Once you're down there  You never win 
[01:21:30]  On the street  Right  When the cops have you  And they're trying to cuff you  For whatever reason  Yeah okay  Because you're black  They're just trying to cuff you  Now  You're black  Cuffed  And beaten  Because it's going to end  With you cuffed  And getting put in jail  But I just don't understand  Just get cuffed  What's with the fighting back  What fight?  They're not going to stop  And go  You're too tough to cuff  Get out of here  Get out of here  Take off  Well we got audio  The victim was on 
[01:22:00]  Was this the Today Show?  We'll find out in a second  It'll be very obvious  I remember him  Grabbing me by the throat  And saying the following  It was an elliptic  And I don't want to repeat it  What was said  But it wasn't something  Very nice  An elliptic?  If he meant epithet  That is the funniest  Mispronunciation  I've ever heard in my life 
[01:22:30]  Epithet  Like a racial epithet  It was an elliptic  An elliptic?  I seen the cops  Knocking the truck window out  And I thought  They was giving the man UPS  I thought the man was dead  That's the way it was  It was an elliptic  Wow  Wow  He was using an elliptic  He doesn't want to repeat  What a dumb nooper  We'll have to listen again  Off to the instant feedback 
[01:23:00]  Chris from Boston  Hey guys  What's the big deal  With that beating in New Orleans  The Boston police  Are going to use that  As a police training film  Because it was so good  Alright here it is again  I want to repeat it  What was said  But it wasn't something  Very nice  Were you aware  I do remember that  Were you aware  There were a number  Of officers on you?  Uh yes  I think it was a total  Of about six  I do remember  There was a lady  A white lady  In the crowd  Who was screaming 
[01:23:30]  The man didn't do anything  The man didn't do anything  Stop  She meant the cops  And I do recall  Them telling her  That if she didn't move  That they were going  To arrest her  Do you know  Who that woman was  By the way  You don't know  Who she was?  No  I don't  I would like to know  Because I'd like to  Thank her  For her intervention  Oh  Buddy  Screwed up again  That she invented something  Wow 
[01:24:00]  Why were they saying  Like ellipticals  That I don't know  Ellipticals  Jesus  Oh boy  Anthony  You're a typical  Stupid ignorant white boy  Yes I am  I said I'm ignorant  On this  I admit  To you  Ignorance sir  Patrice tried to explain it like  You don't just get cuffed  Because you're being beaten  He equated it to something  While you're getting  Your face pinched  I forgot what it was  But he said  Just try to do this  While someone's  Pinching your face  Okay 
[01:24:30]  I could see maybe  If you're getting beaten  You're trying to defend yourself  But again  I can't see it going from  Hello sir  You were speeding  To  You're dragged out  Of the car  And being beaten  I don't see it happening  Well I'm looking at  The new video  With the blood  All over the sidewalk  Yeah he's a bleeder  He got tuned up  Pretty good  He definitely  Let's say hi to  Bleed out a little bit  Where are we going  Oh we're going to Darren  Okay  Darren what's going on  Hey what's up man  What's going on 
[01:25:00]  Darren my brother  What's up  Listen Ed  Yeah  It's like I told  Whoever the screener was  Uh huh  I can't  I can't say to you  Like I understand  Why white guys  Don't have rhythm  Y'all just don't  And you know  I accept it  The same way  You can't understand  Why  You know  I go to malls  Sometimes  And you know  I'm a coach  So sometimes  I don't sweat  And I look kind of  Bummy  And you don't know  How many times  I'm followed  Yeah  Security  You know  Undercover security  Is following me  And looking at me  And sometimes 
[01:25:30]  When I'm shopping  I'm not  You know  I'm thinking  About other things  So I guess  To the human  I look like  I'm trying to  Steal something  But I'm not  Let me tell you  Something  Let me tell you  Something on the  Other side of that  Sir  I wish I could  Walk into a store  And have security  Follow me  Because when I  Don't buy anything  And I go to leave  I feel like I have to  Linger around the door  A little bit  Like I didn't  Take anything  You know  You ever walk into a store  And you walk right out  And you feel like  You're going to be  Accused of stealing something  So you stop by  The magazine rack  He wouldn't stop to read 
[01:26:00]  If he was stealing something  And then I leave  Do you start whistling  You black people  Have the convenience  That you've been watched  The entire time  And they know  You didn't steal anything  Find yourself  Whistling a tune  As you're trying  To leave the store  But wait  Put him back to the sky  It's like  If someone's beating you  You're not going to  Just stand there  And take it  But it didn't just go  From high  To a beating  Like there's a point  Where the cops  Are going to try  To either cuff you  Or put you against the wall  And frisk you  Or do something  And there's always 
[01:26:30]  That turnaround of  Hey what you doing  Motherfucker  Or just submit  Fucking submit  But sometimes  You want to know  Okay fine  Like you said  Just submit  But you just  Or you're trying to tell them  You know sometimes  I watch cops  And I'm looking at the cops  Bending these guys arms  And the guy's like  Listen I'm not trying  To fight you  Just let me get my arm  And they go  Relax sir  Relax sir  And the second  The guy relaxes  Then they can cuff them  Put your wrists together 
[01:27:00]  And they will cuff you  And problem's over  I just don't get  What the  Because I've watched  Cops enough too  I see what it  What it is  It's the whole  Alright  Get up against the wall  You're under  Hey what I do  What I  And then  No I admit  Because sometimes  You know  There's sometimes  Like I'm in the car  And what I hate  Is if I'm in the car  And a friend of mine  I get pulled over  And my friend's like  Why are we being pulled over  And I'm trying to tell them  To shut up  Because I'm  I can probably 
[01:27:30]  Take my way  Out of almost  Any ticket  Because the type of people  That I deal with  In my job  And where I work  A lot of times  In my local area  If I drop  Where I work  Guys are more  You know  Cops are more inclined  To say okay listen  You know  Just go on about  Your business  Right  I definitely understand  That but then  Sometimes I come up  With certain cops  That are just  Really really  Assholes  Right  How many cops  Are you running into  And I have enough  I have enough  In me to say 
[01:28:00]  Okay Darren  You've got to be  The bigger man  You've got to calm down  But I can kind of  Understand sometimes  Because  See  I can't  I'm not standing here  Saying I grew up  In a project  I grew up  In a hard time  But I know people  Who have  In all their life  They've been  They've been pushed around  You know  The cops come in  In the projects  And they just  Search them for no reason  Not no reason  They're going into  The project  What they're doing  Is profiling  Is what they're doing  Exactly  Which well  You know something  Sorry  That's where the crime  Is in the projects 
[01:28:30]  And if someone's  Walking around  And  But the thing is  Dude  I don't understand  I still don't understand  Why  There's got to be  Confrontation  And not just  If  If  If you're not  Doing anything  Submit  That's what I say  Just  If a cop  Went to  Throw me against  The wall  Go ahead  Do it  Am I going to  So wait  If a cop  Goes to throw you  Against the wall  You're not going to  Ask one question  Like 
[01:29:00]  You know  Because  You watch the  See it on  Cops sometimes  You know  Probably white guys  Didn't throw me  Against the wall  And they're like  Hey dude  What's going  And the cops  Are just jamming  Them up  And japping them up  I will save my  Questions for when  I'm handcuffed  And laying on the ground  Then I'll talk  Like a motherfucker  But I swear to you  And it'll still be  In a respectful tone  Young man  I'd have a tough time  Not talking  Or doing something  In that situation  You can't win  I'm not going to lie to you  I'd have a tough time  If a cop is  Roughing me up 
[01:29:30]  I would  I would  What's going on  What's the problem  You know  And sometimes  Cops don't want to hear that  And like you said  You got one side  That just wants to know  What's going on  The other side  What a lot of people  Don't realize  Is that with all this  Is going on  Adrenaline is throwing  In these cops  And it's like  They don't know  What's going to happen  So any slight move  You know  They've got to defend themselves  They don't know  If you're making a slight move  To you know  Go for your wallet  Or if you're making a slight move  To go for a gun  So you know  That's what  All right Darren  Thank you so much  Yo guys 
[01:30:00]  Thank you  We could talk about this  All morning  But we're  I love the show  I love the show  As always  Thanks man  Welcome back buddy  Thank you man  I appreciate it  All right  Take care  You know  I have a tough time  Listening to people  And when people tell me  What to do  So I would probably  Have a problem  In that situation  You just can't live  I'm not even  You know  I'm not trying to act  Like a tough guy  I would get beat  And hurt  And it would be  My own fucking fault  But that's my mentality  When someone tells me  You know  To do something  It's something in me  I get all fucking pissed off 
[01:30:30]  And freaked out  It's a cop  Yeah there's the  There's the video  They're just showing  This video over  And over again  Now why  See his arm  Why is he not  Just putting it  Behind his back  I don't understand  That part of it  That's what I don't get  He makes really good  Cookies though man  I gotta tell you  We got more audio  Here's the victim  Talking this morning  During this time  That they're on you  We can hear them  On the tape  Saying turn over  Turn over 
[01:31:00]  And you were saying  I'm trying  We can't  Reproduce that  Well enough  That the audience  Can hear it  But we can hear it  On the tape  What was going on  At that point  Well I think  That one of the guys  Had his knee  In my lower lombard area  Either a knee  Or a foot  I can't  I don't know  Because I couldn't  See much of anything  I do know  I was bleeding  From the mouth  And I remember  Being kicked in the face  As we're talking  To you  Obviously we're showing 
[01:31:30]  Parts of the tape  That was taken  Of this incident  But I gather  You haven't  I haven't seen the tape  And don't want to  I haven't seen the tape  And don't want to  I would like to see it  I would like to see it  But I haven't  My daughter  Who's my mentor  On this  And her fiance  Have kept me away  From all  TV and everything  Because they don't want me  To look at any of this  They've been in charge 
[01:32:00]  More than I have  That's bullshit  The video is everywhere  Yeah  It's absolutely everywhere  Why wouldn't you want  To watch the tape  Of you scratching  Off a winning lottery ticket  Right  Yeah  Really  That's worth  That's worth a few mil  Right there  Well he said  The guy had his foot  In his lower lumbar  And that's really  Going to hurt  Nothing worse  Than a knee  In your lumbar  Let's go to  Yam bag in North Carolina  Yam bag  Hey you guys  You're right  There's another view  Of that camera  I mean you don't see it 
[01:32:30]  But it's out there  If you find it on the internet  The guy walks up  On the cop  And taps him on his shoulder  And says  Excuse me sir  You know it's where north is  I didn't see the beating  At all though  I mean I have not seen  Any of the footage  Hawk has something  It's just the aftermath  Which is a piece of  Oh yeah he is really  Bleeding from the mouth  There's no reason  To beat him like that  Absolutely not  I never said  There was a reason  To beat him like that  I just don't understand  You know  I don't know  It's in your nature man  Some people don't like 
[01:33:00]  Being told what to do  You know I'm not  I'm not trying to defend it  But I just know how  I would  I would  Then  You're going to get  Taken down  However they have  To take it down  You remember when  We had two female cops  In the studio  Yeah  When we did something  Called resisting arrest  We had two female cops  And they both  Had to take  Each of us down  And arrest us  And we had to resist  As much as we could  That's what you're going to get  But it's going to end  With you in handcuffs  And they weren't using clubs 
[01:33:30]  And they kicked the shit out of us  Yeah  We were just  Sad to say  They kicked the shit out of us  We have one more clip  From this interview this morning  It's  Good morning America  Your lawyer is going to have to  Stand up and answer  The charges that have been  Filed against you  Number one  That you were publicly  Intoxicated  Were you  I don't drink  At all  I haven't drank for over 25 years  At all  I haven't drank for over 25 years  And I'm proud to say that  Did you resist 
[01:34:00]  Arrest in any way  How could you  How could you resist arrest  When you're getting sucker punched  You know  I mean  That's illogical  I mean  Someone hits you from behind  Throws you against a wall  And then tells them  You will kick your ass  And then  Chokes you  Those are the things  That happened  Because I remember those things  Because at that time  I was dazed  But I still was able  To maintain some sense 
[01:34:30]  Of direction  Alright Mr. Davis  Appreciate you being with us  All the best to you  Alright here's another question  Alright if you're getting choked  You're definitely going to try  To get the cop's arm off  Off of your neck  With your hands  Because it's just  Well then you're going  Instant  You're going to panic mode  That's just  Survival mode  Here's the other thing  I want to throw on the table  When was this video shot  Was it right after Katrina  When everyone was  Beyond on edge  I don't know  This is very recently  Well yeah but they have him  On TV with a beard now  It doesn't look like  He has a beard  In that footage 
[01:35:00]  Well obviously  Bourbon Street was open  For business  So it can't be that long ago  It was Saturday  It was Saturday  Yeah  Okay  He cleaned up pretty good  He didn't look all that beat up  Alright  Guess it must have been  A nosebleed  Well America's talking  About that today  That's for sure  We'll see what happens  We'll see how that goes  Man I tell you though  When white cops beat up  Black guys  Jesus Christ  It's always on video  It really is  You see his head  Come apart  Alright  We have one more  News thing here  It concerns Steve 
[01:35:30]  Our own Steve  Steve  Yeah remember this little thing  We found this morning  Tonight on News 4 at 11  In an accident  Every second counts  You want out of that car  But if you're trapped  In a hybrid  There's a potentially  Dangerous hitch  Some of these have charges  That exceed 500 volts  Obviously 500 volts  Can be fatal  For rescue workers  These hot selling hybrids  Present high stakes challenges  The danger is  The vehicle can move  News 4's Jim Handley 
[01:36:00]  With a crash course  On what's fueling  New concerns  Hybrid hazard  Tonight on News 4 at 11  Oh uh oh Steve  Hybrid hazard  Hybrid hazard  And here he comes  To defend himself  And hybrid  Oh  Oh no look out  Don't touch it  Get him out  Don't touch it  Get the jaws of life  Oh my god  I'm okay  Thank you  5,000 volts  Or 500 volts  How many volts  In there  500  500 volts  In the battery 
[01:36:30]  That's actually controlling  The hybrid engine  Yeah  So how do you die  In that situation  I'm dead if I get  In an accident  With that hybrid  I mean I'm not  I'm realistic about it  It's a small car  It's one big crumples  On that whole thing  So if I'm in  A serious enough accident  That the actual engine  Is meeting my flesh  In some way  Yeah  I'm dead anyway  I think they were also  Talking about rescue workers  You know that's kind of  A hazard for the  Hybrid hazard for rescue workers  There's a bear  In the driver's seat  The hybrid engine 
[01:37:00]  Is all the way  In the back of the car  So in order for that  To be any  I guess you'd have to  Rearrend it pretty hard  I think what they're thinking  Is if you get in an accident  And something screws up  With the battery  And the contacts  For the battery  Are all of a sudden  Hitting the side  Of the car perhaps  A rescue worker  Goes to get you out  Touches the car  He's going to get  500 volts  Throw him  And uh  Ah  You know  Ah  He's in a dangerous profession  They know what they're  Getting themselves into  They know what they're  Getting themselves into  I've  I've had to jumpstart 
[01:37:30]  That car once  And uh  I didn't get shocked  Or anything like that  It's a risk you gotta take  When you're saving  Tens of dollars  Right  Exactly  Because that's what  They're saying  They're saying  The uh  The savings really  Doesn't add up  Now you've said  In the past  That it does  It does  Considering what I was  Driving before  Which was an SUV  That was getting  14 miles to the gallon  Yeah  Versus the thing  I'm driving now  Which gets 45 miles  To the gallon average  They're saying  Some of these  Optimum miles per gallon  That they're  They're getting  And posting  Are that you're driving 
[01:38:00]  Like they did  In these tests  Yeah  With this highway  You're accelerating  And braking  At certain speeds  So  Yeah  They say city driving  Really isn't doing  That much  I don't know  If I agree with that  But you're right  About the fact  That people's  Your driving habits  Ideally should change  If you're gonna go  And buy a hybrid  Because  To really get  The optimal miles  Per gallon  You're gonna  You're gonna have to  You know  Not slam on the gas  The second the light  Turns green  You're actually gonna  Have to you know  Deal with that  Not driving 80 miles  An hour on the highway 
[01:38:30]  You know  And actually drive  The speed limit  Yeah  Are you growing soybeans  In your backyard yet  No not yet  For that alternative  Fuel store  Biodiesel  We were talking  About yesterday  Not quite  Steve's all about  The alternate energy  Yeah  If hydrogen cars  Are available  And there's hydrogen  Fueling stations  I'm all over it  I think that's great  Yeah  Steve's about  Alternative everything  And believe me  Lifestyle's showing up  Showing up  Alright Steve  Thanks  There he goes 
[01:39:00]  How did that happen  I know a big bear  He talked with good diction  Hibernates in Toyota  With good fuel emissions  And great tax deductions  His habitat's a hybrid  His paws are on the steering wheel  He barely fits inside it  His cave has XM  And a keyless entry  Don't leave the scent  In your tent  His belly is empty  The only bear  I know a gastric bypass  Smarter than the average  Roll up in the hybrid  And steal your picnic basket  The ranger's lunch 
[01:39:30]  Always makes his belly groan  The last I seen him  He was speeding around  Jellystone  Getting 40 miles per gallon  Rolling through the Rockies  Doing Ramone promos  For two-disc jockeys  Steve's a piece of garbage  Forged for nuts and berries  Top of the food chain  But drives a car for ferries  Piece of shit  Stores energy with friction  And magnets  Ramones  Hybrids are for faggots  Hybrids are gay  Steve's a queer  Plug in your automobile  You take it in the rear  You homo  Yo his car got a kickstand  Go and buy a new one

Yeah, Steve like  Yeah  Steve changes his look on a weekly basis  It's awful  Why?  What's wrong with it?  The length it's at now  It's just like barely combable 
[01:41:00]  I don't like it  Yeah, I know  It's because it's growing in from bald  And it's got to go through this awkward stage  Of being unmanageable  You look like George Clooney  But not at all  Yeah  I was waiting for that  I can always tell when I'm about to get smashed by Jimmy  Because he just looks at me up and down  And sizes me up  Right as I'm approaching a microphone  And you can tell he's loading a rifle  You're a character  You're an interesting character  Yeah  I love you  You know I love you  I know you do, Jimmy  We all know when Jimmy's going to smash us  Because all of a sudden his eyes get really wide  Like, oh, I can't wait  Yeah, his eyes get wide 
[01:41:30]  And he looks you up and down  And he goes, okay  I've got my three points  Better up  You'd be a horrible poker player  I am  I am  You are, right?

We've got a few minutes  We've got a few minutes  These guys are huge  We're kind of stalling here  I was just trying to explain to Poe who they were  That's all  Oh, jeez  Good luck  How did that work out for you? 
[01:45:00]  He never heard of them  Are they going to have to  They're not filling out  No, of course not  Gentlemen, do you have identification?  Gentlemen  Chris Cornell  You want to rock star?  You've got a couple minutes  If you want to play a trailer  Oh, really?  Yeah  Alright  Well, we can get into the movie trailer thing, Jimmy  While you've been being a big star in Hollywood  Laszlo starred something  The Opie and Anthony movie trailer  Spoon man  You know, I could kill a man with a spoon  Alright  And, you know  His trailer was brilliant 
[01:45:30]  Great  Loved it  And stupid us were like  Well, why don't we have a movie trailer contest?  So the quality dropped down drastically after Laszlo  You know, I've agreed to make six appearances on the Opie and Anthony show  And I'm going to try to get some of my friends in Hollywood to do the same  So without further ado  Here's Laszlo's Opie and Anthony movie trailer  Jimmy's hearing this for the first time  In 2002  Darkness covered the land  The Catholic League is praising Infinity Broadcasting for cancelling the Opie and Anthony show 
[01:46:00]  And evil reigned supreme  Who, who, Robin?  Until one day  They returned  And all hell broke loose  Bullshit!  Can you hear me?  I'm Jim Norton  And I'm on the radio  Shut up  One Wednesday  I picked up a guy in a dress  And he sucked my dick  You just sit back and watch  What happens next  Opie  Shut up  Shut up  Anthony  Away with you 
[01:46:30]  Away  Away  Leave  Leave the fucking studio  Jim Norton  Every one of you is a time-wasting cockteam  I will beat children about the head  And the O&A Army  Our fans are a bunch of jackasses  Three men  Leading an army from the pits of darkness  You are shit  You are worthless  We're all losing  I could give a fuck  Fighting the evil nemesis  Poisoning the land  You're a fucking

[01:48:00]  That's great  That is a true movie trailer  That's Laszlo  We should have just left it there  But we decided to make a Opie and Anthony movie trailer contest  With the listeners  A project  A home project for the listeners  And you know how inept they are  They're just gonna spurl it  They'll ruin it  And well you know  We got a lot of them in Jimmy  And finally we're gonna play the top six  So here are the top six  Were there any duds  There were a lot of duds in this one man 
[01:48:30]  Eesh  A lot  But in sixth place  Coke Logic from Wackbag came up with this one  In a world of mystery  Who wrote the note about Masterpoth  Throwing out some bloody clothes  Bloody clothing?  Like the top half of a karate uniform  It was just covered in blood  Would you like to hear the truth?  There was blood on the gi  In a world of deceit 
[01:49:00]  In a comedy shop  There's bars  I drink while I drive  ONA Party Rock  I have a reputation  My reputation is  Extremely important to me  You do say that he drives drunk  Only when going by children  Yeah  In a world of fear  To clear this up  Opie was telling me about the situation  Concerning the guard downstairs  And I thought that was more important than soap  Coming soon  Alright, I wanted to make sure  Are you going to kick the guard's ass for us?  Uh, no, I will not do that  However, I'll make sure that he doesn't yell at me 
[01:49:30]  When do you get to kick ass?  No, when someone comes in and  Physically goes towards me  It's body language and also their eyes  What style have you taken?  Okinawan, Kempo, Karate, Shotokan, Karate, Ishanu, Karate  What form?  Master Poe  Goes from silent assassin  To sleepy assassin  Someone wake up Master Poe  Someone wake him up  Get Master Poe back to reality  Master Poe, how do we wake him up?  Master Poe, wake up  Master Poe  I understand Master Poe 
[01:50:00]  Get out of the zone  Holy  Master Poe goes to another place  He just goes out  Wow  Oza, sound asleep  The security desk  Sound asleep  Steve just videoed it  He's in the sound provarian  Head is down  He is completely asleep  Not even trying to look like he's awake  Or hidden or anything  Master Poe  Yeah, I don't know  Are we disturbing your sleep today?  No, I'm doing just fine  They got video of you sleeping  Oh 
[01:50:30]  But you fell asleep  So you're probably a little sleepy  From something last night  Yeah, we don't have video of you  Eating an egg sandwich  We have video of you  Snoring and sleeping  We're not getting out of this one  Okay  Why do you feel like you're the only one  That can't be part of this radio show?  We caught you sleeping  So now you have to tell us something  Were you meditating?  You know something?  I was  That's sixth place  It's kind of  It went a little too long  Is what happened  Yeah, these are  These are the best ones  That was sixth 
[01:51:00]  We had to suffer for a few weeks  Yeah  That went too long  Went too long  But that came in sixth place  And had no ending  It had no ending  You shoot yourself  Well, you should have started  At fifth place  I think, Nathaniel  But  What, did you run out of tape?  I know  It just kind of ends  Yeah, you know  Usually you  You kind of  Bring it all together  With the end  Of your production piece  But that just  That just ends 
[01:51:30]  Than?  With no real  Point  Yeah  If running a little long  Were a criteria  That would exclude you  From the competition  We'd have no entries  So  True, yeah  Hey, shouldn't we go like  Check one, two  Into the microphones?  Why?  Because then when the band  Comes in  And they talk  And they don't work  The mics  We can maybe  Head that off  Right here, right now  Check one, two  Is so old school  Nathaniel  Why don't you try out  That fine wireless mic

[02:08:00]  XM vice president of programming  Eric Logan  Who has great hair  Is denying any liability  And while their assault  On the media campaign  Has attracted national attention  The consequences  Could have been severe  Breaking news  Former CBS reporter  Arthur Cheyenne  Has reportedly gone  On a rampage  Outside the XM studios  In New York  Attacking Opie and Anthony  With a samurai sword  While shouting  The same expletive  That got him fired  Hey  What the fuck  Is your problem there?

[02:10:30]  You have bones  This is my life  Living with so much pain  That's just a little piece  Be yourself  Be yourself  Is all that you can learn  Yeah  So be yourself  Is all that you can learn  Ah, very nice 
[02:11:00]  Audio Slave  You're checking out  The Opie and Anthony program  We call it  The ONA Virus  Spreading across America  Thanks to  XM Satellite Radio  That's right  Getting more gooder  Every day  And in the studio  We have Audio Slave  Hello  What up  And they're just waking up  They got their Starbucks  And their water  And they're like  What the fuck are we doing here  Yeah, we never have the right  We don't have the right hours  For rock guys  Yeah  Well 
[02:11:30]  We'll make do  We'll all make do  Well we used to do afternoons  And we would go through  At least, I don't know  Two or three cases of beer a day  The beers were going on  No joke  We had a frozen Jaeger machine  And it was afternoons  It's like, you know  Four in the afternoon  Who can't start drinking at four, you know  I like that commitment  Yeah  We really did commit  Right up until they threw us off  We had three or four refrigerators  Filled with beer  One was supposed to be for food  But we gave up on that  But now in the morning  It's like, yeah  You can have an egg white omelette  And some coffee  Well, a morning audience  Has their demands, you know 
[02:12:00]  They want a sharp wit  We brought the Jaeger Meister machine  We brought the Jaeger Meister machine with us  But that was  Turned out to be a really bad idea  Really bad idea  And as you can see  It's not in the studio anymore  When can we actually  Tell what happened then  Because it's been a year  Has it been a year?  Look at Hawkshank in his head  No?  Underage drinking what?  I don't know what the hell happened  I think she showed up drunk  Girl, backroom fuck what? 
[02:12:30]  He gets all nervous  Yeah, it was a bad day  Did you meet directly involved?  What?  It was a bad day  No bad, no nothing  The differences on satellite radio  Are immediately apparent  Let me tell you  Oh, yeah  Oh, gentlemen  Welcome to the wonderful world  Of satellite fucking radio  This is like Wizard of Oz  When it goes into color mode  We're in color mode now, man  It's a whole new world  This satellite radio  No restrictions with language  Or anything you can talk about  Yet  None of the crap  Yeah, well 
[02:13:00]  We're going to take advantage of it  Before they decide  Well, now  We've got to regulate this, too  Yeah, there were no restrictions  On the internet  When that first started, right?  And now it's  You guys obviously  Had your fair share  Of the fun  Of people trying to get into  The shit you're trying to release  Back in the old days, right?  Yeah, yeah  More than our fair share  Yeah  A lot of the  PMRC, was it called?  Yeah  And more than that  I mean, more recently, too  There's, you know  We've been no stranger  To censorship through the years  Really?  Are you still dealing with that? 
[02:13:30]  I mean, not lately  Not in the last  Yeah, yeah  But it depends  If the terror alert  Goes to burnt magenta  Or something  Then we're once again  In danger  We had a subway terror alert  For the last week  Here in New York City  Turned out to be nothing  Once again, so  We think it might have  Something to do with an election  Or I do, anyway  Yeah  Or mayor's trying to get re-elected  Oh, yeah  And all of a sudden  He's showing he's in control, I guess  I don't know  Government wouldn't lie to us  I was going to say  A politician would never do anything  Never  Of course not  And then, just before you guys  Walked in the studio  We were all laughing  Because Bush is like 
[02:14:00]  Hammering nails on TV  This morning, so  Yeah, he's doing some  Habitat for Humanity thing  So they got 20,000 camera crews  Around him  Watching him  Trying to drive a nail  And it's just the saddest thing  Man  It sounds special  Yeah  It sounds special, alright  The hammer was wrestled to the ground  When it hit the president's thumb  I wonder if they'll show him on TV  When he drives the nail  Into the 2,000th coffin  Of the young man or woman  From the service  Coming home  I wonder  There you go  That'll be as well covered  No, I don't think 
[02:14:30]  We'll be seeing any of those  Hijinks  Look at you now  Being all controversial  Oh, yeah  Hey, it's satellite, baby  Let's roll  Yeah, we'll wait for the calls  To come in from Alabama now  Yeah  Thanks, Tom  I appreciate it  What the fuck you talking about  Goddamn you  Get back to the  Jägermeister machine, Tom  Yeah  What's wrong with you, boy?  Yeah, how into the whole political end  Were you guys with rage and stuff?  Pretty well into it  Was it like  Well, a lot of people 
[02:15:00]  As into it as you can get, I think  But, no, I'm just saying  Because, like, Zach was the one  That always came off as the one  That was, like, really  As us white people called  The problem  You know what I mean?  No, he came across  The guy that was really  At the forefront of it  And just very into it  I was just wondering  How the rest of the guys were  Yeah  I mean, I couldn't be  More into it  Really?  Couldn't even tell you  Yeah  Yeah  Did things change, though?  When you got successful?  And really  It almost seemed like 
[02:15:30]  Hell no  The more success you got  The kind of more  People would kind of look and go  Eh, it's a little hypocritical now  No, I know  They did that in the beginning  Yeah?  Really?  Yeah  No, but, I mean, definitely  I think the more successful  The band became  Definitely the much more  Radical the band became  Really?  Absolutely  Because as I was looking  Because, I mean, I watched you guys  From, you know, right when you guys hit  And it kind of looked like  Wow, they're, you know, bashing the system 
[02:16:00]  But they are certainly capitalizing on it  And earning the U.S. dollars and everything  I mean, the way that we looked at it  And Rage Against the Machine was a band  I mean, yes, we did  There's no doubt that we did earn money  But we gave away millions of dollars  You know, to various activists  And charitable organizations  That really wasn't the point  The point of being on a label like Epic Records  Which bands like The Clash were on  You know, major labels also had Public Enemy  Bob Marley, artists like Bob Dylan as well  Was to get that message to as many people as possible  And you and I probably wouldn't be talking about it today 
[02:16:30]  Had we not been on that label to begin with  To discuss the opinions of that band  But it must be tough to balance it out like that  You know  There was never any conflict within the band  There may have been conflict within some people's minds  But we did our best to use the platform that we had  To stir up as much shit as possible  It's like XM radio people  That's right  Was that your first  Feels free  Feels free  Was that your first curse right there?  It might have been 
[02:17:00]  It's fun, right?  No, no, every once in a while it happens  No, I mean  Oh, yeah  It happens and there's  Someone's on the button  Have you ever rolled down Rodeo with the shotgun?  Before this tour is done  Maybe  Before we move on  What is Zach doing these days?  You know as well as I do  We've heard all sorts of rumors  That he's in the woods somewhere  And just, you know, fighting  All sorts of things  I don't think that that's the case  He's been working on a record for some time  But that's  I've got to be honest  When Rage kind of broke up  And I was like  Oh, man 
[02:17:30]  And then you got Chris Cornell  And then did the Audio Slave thing  I couldn't be happier  You guys  You pulled it off  I couldn't figure out how you were going to pull it off  Because you guys had such a unique sound  And a unique, you know, lead singer  But, you know, props to you guys  We were lucky  Yeah, the Audio Slave thing is really, really working for you guys  And you went to Cuba  Yes, yes we did  Which brings us here this morning  But how do you get into Cuba?  Can anyone go to Cuba?  Canada  There's only one way  You have to sign a piece of paper  Seriously, there's only one way you can do it 
[02:18:00]  And you have to put a lot of time into it  Really?  But I want to go to Cuba, let's say  A seaworthy raft  That actually can float for 100 miles  And hold a PA  Did you guys go?  I actually just got an offer to go for Thursday and Friday  But I couldn't because I was here to Guantanamo  Is that where you guys went?  No, we went to Cuba  We went to Havana, Cuba  But how do you  I could go tomorrow?  No, you absolutely not  How did you guys get to go?  It's not  It took a great deal of wrangling, you know, bureaucratic 
[02:18:30]  Because I didn't think anyone could go to Cuba that's American, whatever  Did you go under the guise of like a humanitarian thing or something?  No, no, there was no guise  It was like the U.S. Treasury Department and Fidel Castro  Had to sign the piece of paper that said Audio Slave can come there  As part of like a cultural exchange  Someone tells me they don't sign a lot of things together  You don't see them agreeing on too much  But they did on Audio Slave  Wow, that's great on Audio Slave  Yeah, yeah, yeah  So Fidel's got to be a big fan  Yeah, well, it's hard to say  He didn't come down to the show 
[02:19:00]  But it was unbelievable  About 65,000 other people  Yeah, 65  Wow  You think he said yes because you guys are anti-establishment in general?  I don't think that had anything to do with it  No?  I think that  I mean  Go ahead, Brian  I was just going to say  We were just very persistent  We really wanted to do it  No American rock band had ever played there  And we were determined to be the first one  How are they getting music down in Cuba?  Where does their music come from?  Well, there's Miami radio stations for one  That they get  But there's not that much internet access  So it's through like bootleg CDs and stuff 
[02:19:30]  But they don't get like a smack  They get like Lloyd Banks  And they get Venom  So it's not like the Billboard Top 200 that they get  But it was really unbelievable  You know, we went down there  And the show was announced about two days  Before the actual show happened  So we had no idea how many people were going to show up  And it ended up being about 70,000 that showed up  Did they know your stuff?  Or they were just there to say  They knew some of the songs  They knew some of the songs  And they were appreciative of all the songs  You know, we  And we played the longest concert of our 
[02:20:00]  We played over two and a half hours  Wow  We played every song we could imagine  We jammed with like local Cuban musicians  Did you run out of songs?  We ran out of songs  All of a sudden you're like  Oh no  What's the crowd like?  I mean, the differences between, you know  Playing here in the States and playing in Cuba  Timmy, what's the crowd like?  The crowd was different, you know  It was like most crowds work as one  Kind of like an ocean  And it was more like a river with rapids 
[02:20:30]  Really?  There was people salsa dancing  There were people pitting  There were some people standing still  There were others with their hands in the air  You know, and it was just  It was clear that they had never rocked out like that before  Yeah  And that was the cool thing about it  Wow  To see that many people salsa dancing to Killing in the Name  Yeah, that's just gotta be a little odd  But very cool, man  Holy shit  Yeah, you wouldn't think  Yeah  Was there any sign that maybe they were a little inhibited because of 
[02:21:00]  Not at all  Inhibited is not a word that I would use  Yeah, the only sign they had was the swastika with the Abu Ghraib people right there behind the stage  Yeah, the stage is actually backed up against  It's not the American Embassy or Council  But the one U.S. building on the island outside of Guantanamo  Is right next to the stage  It was the plaza where we played was built for the Elian Gonzalez rallies, you know  So it was like sort of the one modern venue in the country  And like Sammy said, they had that kind of 
[02:21:30]  That was what he was describing was facing the U.S. consulate place  Wow  Yeah, they had Elian Gonzalez on TV very recently in 60 Minutes  He's now 11 and he's happy to be back in Cuba  Looks like a father figure  Yeah  Do you do some sightseeing?  They opened the place up for you and really got a good look around?  It was amazing  I mean, that's the part that was probably the most surprising  Is we thought we were just going down there to give the people of Cuba a great treat  You know, here's some rock, enjoy yourselves  And we got so much more out of it probably than we could have ever given back 
[02:22:00]  It was the experience  We were there for like three or four days  And the experience we had meeting people  And the emphasis on like culture and the arts  And the amazing musicians we met  And the kind of the warmth and pride of the people there  It really blew us away  And we had the cameras rolling for all of it  Oh great, wow  We got not only the concert part but also our amazing journey to Havana there on the DVD as well  Yeah, Audios Live in Cuba 
[02:22:30]  When this comes out today?  Yeah, that's correct  Mountain biking in Cuba  Yeah, it's kind of sweet  There's no like guards to prevent you from riding on any of the ruins  The ancient ruins that they have  Just ride your bike right up on it  Wow, man  You think they're happy down there?  What's your thoughts as you left Cuba?  I'd say that there's  Do they want a different way of life?  I would say that there's  Not only is there an economic embargo by the U.S. against Cuba  There's very much an information embargo  Yeah  As American citizens we have no idea what really goes on down there 
[02:23:00]  I think there's a lot of propaganda on both sides  Yeah  That just completely keeps us from really understanding each other's culture  You guys going down there and filming stuff and bringing it back is pretty cool  Yeah, and hopefully that will open some doors between  I think they're fine though  The people are there  They got Coke  They got Pepsi  They got Budweiser  They're totally content  There's an embargo  I would love if they opened up Cuba  Yeah  I mean, I think it would be 
[02:23:30]  I mean, there's one thing about it that was very refreshing  Was, you know, because it's not  One thing that everywhere you tour  Everywhere in the world you tour  Is, you know, you tour in capitalist countries  So there's like billboards  And there's Paris Hilton  And there's Britney News everywhere  And there's, you know, KFC everywhere  And there's none of that there  I mean, there's absolutely none  Which was very, very refreshing  You know, you get the occasional  Like, you know, Che Guevara billboard  And beyond that  You get none of that jammed down your throat  Pictures of Fidel around or?  A few  Yeah  You get Coke and Pepsi though 
[02:24:00]  Yeah  A lot of that  That's what I hate about America now  All the franchising  You go to any part of this country  It's not just America  You go everywhere  Everywhere  From, you know, Belgium  Well, it's bottled in Mexico City  So it's not American  And at times, you're like  Why do I even bother leaving New York?  It's pretty much the same wherever you go  As far as the Starbucks  I mean, it's everything  Unless you're in a communist country  No real billboard  Yeah  That's the point I'm getting at  I used to love the mom-and-pop shops and stuff  But obviously it's drastically changed 
[02:24:30]  Someone's yelling at us  Because we haven't introduced you guys  It's audio-slaving  Chris Cornell's about to walk into the studio  And we've got the whole band here  Here he is right now  Here comes Chris  Hey Chris  Hello Chris  We started without you, sir  I came late so that I could be singled out  Is that it?  We started without you  We're talking about the whole Cuba thing, obviously  The new DVD comes out today, Live in Cuba  Oh, great, who did that?  That sounds fun  You mean a band played in Cuba?  And so far it's been very interesting 
[02:25:00]  Yeah  How'd you guys hook up?  Did you have a relationship before?  While you were in Soundgarden?  You guys were in Rage?  Not really, no  No?  We played at Lollapalooza 96  Four shows I think it was together  There was kind of a roving slot on that tour  Where usually it had to do with geography  Like when we were in Michigan  You know, a band from Michigan would play  And when we were in Oklahoma  A band from Oklahoma  And then Rage was just out on the road  So they played four of those slots 
[02:25:30]  And I watched, I think twice  I watched when they played  And I just thought it was one of the best live bands  I've ever seen in my life  Yeah  And that was it  I met them  We got along great  We had like an afternoon  Where you could tell  There was camaraderie right away  We hung out  And we were out on the road  I think with Metallica  Then we didn't really hang out with them  That much on the road  It was that tour  But we just, you know  It was a different thing  But you guys needed a singer, obviously  And then did you have a short list? 
[02:26:00]  It was actually Rick Rubin  Who was pretty instrumental  Really?  In getting us together  Because Rick had produced the last Rage record  And so we were hanging out around Rick's house  You know, he's our friend as well  And talking about what we were going to do  And the, you know  The one name that didn't keep coming up  Rick was like  Dude, you guys need to play with Chris Cornell  There wasn't some ridiculous ones  Like, hey, David Lee Roth  What do you think?  Was there a point?  It was just between those two  Was there a point where you were thinking it's over? 
[02:26:30]  Hell no  Not for a second  Not for a second  You just knew you could move on  No problem  I had a dream about Rick Rubin  Well, actually probably about an hour ago  Because I was asleep an hour ago  Sorry about that  And I had this incredibly cool  High-tech skateboard  And I wanted it  And that was the dream  That was your dream?  It was incredible  It was the coolest skateboard I've ever seen  And when you woke up  Were you bummed out that it was a dream?  Yeah  I hate when that happens  You're like, oh man  Me too  I was rocking in my dream  And I'm now just waking up in a hotel room in New York 
[02:27:00]  And if there's a cool thing  He always has it  You know  Oh, one of those guys  Likes buying the new toys and stuff?  In a lot of ways, yeah  I mean, you would never see him on a skateboard  Ever in a million years  But that's projection in my dream  You guys made a few bucks  Anything that you just like  The first thing that you really went and said  Holy shit, I could afford this now?  A house  A mattress was the first  Really?  It was that bad?  Yeah  And a pinball machine  A mattress and a pinball machine  Those were my first  Those were my first two purposes 
[02:27:30]  Something besides Top Ramen  Yeah  I eat Top Ramen like three times a day  Dinner for two at Red Lobster  That was really  That Top Ramen shit's great though, man  It is  I still like it  And I don't have to eat it now  Yeah  It sustains your life for so long  During those lean years  And it's damn tasty  Well, it embalms you  Because there's so much salt in it  Yeah, the salt preservative  Like a mummy  Now, obviously you've been singing forever  Your voice, man 
[02:28:00]  Probably one of the best in rock  Your range has always been amazing  If I may use the word, Jimmy  Phenomenal  Did you always  Now, you have to know  When you're seeing other people sing  You're in bands and stuff  And you had to know  Wow, I really got something here  When did you realize  When did you realize you were phenomenal?  Yeah, you were  When did you realize you were amazing?  I have moments where I feel that 
[02:28:30]  And moments where I don't feel that  And that's like right now  No  Yeah  I thought you were going to sing  I thought you were going to sing this morning for us  I could  I'm not going to  But I could  I just want you to know that I could  I'm sure it would be really great  But I'm not going to do it  When we get in the van  I'm going to sing for these guys  Oh, they're going to love you for that  Yeah  Is it hard to say?  Obviously in the morning  I was actually  I started out as a drummer  And I wasn't that great of a drummer  And thank God  You know, I had other talents  Because I loved being a musician in a band 
[02:29:00]  And I liked working on songwriting  And performing every aspect of it  But drums was  For me  And I just didn't have  You have to have something  Like Brad has it  That I don't have  You know, just to get in the pocket  And the groove  And you're kind of like the  You know, the foundation of the song in the band  And I just  You either have that, I guess  Or you don't  I don't think you can teach that  But I would sing backups from the drums 
[02:29:30]  And to great acclaim right away  Yeah  And so it didn't take me long  To put two and two together  That, okay, you did  Get off the kit  Yeah  Did you do covers when you played drums?  Absolutely  Yeah, what were some of the covers you did?  First time I ever sang  From Behind the Drums in a band  I think it was a version of Red House  That was based on Jimi Hendrix  Really?  Yeah  And I think I actually sang a Billy Joel song 
[02:30:00]  Alright, that's what we want to hear  Yeah, those are the ones  We don't want to hear the cool covers  That was the first one  But I think you may be right  I may be crazy  Like I still  I kind of know the words to that song still  Because I did that  From the drums  There's a bunch of embarrassing ones  I don't remember  But that, you know  That's just  Did you do any Eagles  From Behind the  No, I think Eagles  Would have been alright  Yeah, that would have bothered me  I was not  That's usually a singing drummer  Usually decides to do a couple  Maybe Hotel California or something  I know we're in New York  And people are going to be upset 
[02:30:30]  But I don't like Billy Joel  Never did like it  Didn't  No  It didn't work for me  He went from like  During the 70s  He was cool for a little while  To listen to  You weren't embarrassed to say  Maybe I was out of the country that  I don't know  I don't remember that  But  He doesn't remember ever being cool  I don't know  I think like the late 70s or something  He was trying to be cool  And that was the problem  You could see it coming  He had the skinny white tie  Over a black suit  Jumping around in white tennis shoes  Like he's a punk rock Billy Joel now  Like a little  And how did they 
[02:31:00]  A piano man was  Was alright  Trying to win over the Clash fans  Although I know  I have people that swear by the fact  That his live show  Was supposed to be as good  As anything  You know  This side of Springsteen  And I guess it's true  I never saw it  You didn't like his lyrics though  When he  Like  You may be right  I may be crazy  When he talks about  Riding his motorcycle in the rain  Yeah  Without shaving  You get the feeling  Like he hasn't shaved  And he's out  He's that crazy  Wacky Billy Joel 
[02:31:30]  That drives around Long Island  And smashes into people  In the middle of the night  When he sees double vision  You gotta like the fact  That he dumped a load  In Christie Brinkley  And then had a few shots  And got in the car  How do you not respect that  Eloquently put  Oh you can do that  On Saturday radio  Well at least he walks the walk  He doesn't talk the talk right  But he walks the walk  There's some news story  That he was  His old drummer I guess  And it's probably a nightmare  For people that go on  To fame  Is when somebody  From your past  Perks up  Because it's not his drummer 
[02:32:00]  That he's played with  For all these years  And was successful with  It's like his original drummer  When they were just  Kicking around  Came out and wrote  This story about him  Wrote a book  And he talks about  Billy Joel drinking  Furniture polish  To catch a buzz  I believe it  That's what you want  Your old drummer  To come out  And talk about those days  Ramen noodles  And furniture polish  Well there was a reason  Why he wore a white tie  Over a black suit  That's probably it  Any old bandmates  That  Do they keep in touch 
[02:32:30]  Because I know  A lot of guys in bands  You've played with people  You know so many  Different people  And then  They just  Some go to the wayside  You pick up some new guys  You ever get a call  Hey dude you need  Like a guitar player  No that not  Soundgarden was together  For a long time  I think that  Well it could have been  Your first band though  No not at all  I had a lot of bands  But I never kept in touch  With anyone  Bass player would call  And go dude  You're in fucking Soundgarden  You don't give me a call  Most of the bands  I was in  Someone's sick  You could call me  You know  They could get on a plane for you  They wouldn't know how to get a hold of me 
[02:33:00]  Most of the bands  I was in before Soundgarden  I left because I didn't like anyone in the band  And that was  So it wasn't  I'm sure they're all there  But we liked you Chris  Maybe they were  I wasn't an asshole  And they were  And that's why I left  God damn  That's always the way  Holy shit  Nothing more fun than being in a band  Speaking of old bands  It just don't  What's the date today?  The 11th  We are  Just shy of two weeks away  From the five years 
[02:33:30]  Since Rage Against the Machine broke up  It's been five years  Five years  Wow  October 24th  2000  God damn  He remembers that date  Where did those  What was that all about?  I was  I was hung over  At my mom's house  And my mom comes in the room  And says  Zach's on the phone  And I'm like  Zach's going to have to wait  I'm sleeping  She comes back about  Like five minutes  And he's like  Zach's on the phone  He says it's important  So I'm like  Hello  He's like  And he tells me  He quits the band 
[02:34:00]  This that and the other  And like there's some  Press release coming out  In a minute on MTV  To say it  And I'm like  Alright bro  I gotta go back to sleep  It was just like that?  Yeah  Did you see it coming?  I saw it coming for about 10 years  It was actually  A surprise each day  That it didn't happen  Was there a lot of friction  Between him and the rest of the guys?  There was constantly  There was constantly tension  Everywhere  Yeah  There was friction everywhere  Yeah  Chris Cornell's a very calming influence  On the group as a whole 
[02:34:30]  You see I told you  Yeah  It wasn't me before  Phenomenally calming  You were not the asshole  You guys a lot happier  Doing the audio slave?  It's  I mean like  On a daily basis  It is just  It's so much  It's  There's a lot less  Tumultuousness  On a daily basis  It's just  It's awesome  And we're so lucky too  Here's five years after  It's like a phoenix  From the air  Five years after  Rage Against Machine  Breaks Up  We're here talking about 
[02:35:00]  Playing in front of  70,000 people in Cuba  In Cuba  It's pretty awesome  Yeah  You're lucky  That's amazing  Chris what did you think of Cuba?  We talked to these guys  About it a little bit  I want to go back  I mean  It was phenomenal  I mean I've talked to people  Since we did it  And of course  You know the experience  For us  Was being an American band  Going there to perform  In front of a lot of people  And I know a lot of people  That aren't Americans  That will talk about  Oh you can just go right into Cuba  If you're not American  And on a vacation  And say  Yeah we didn't do that  It wasn't a vacation 
[02:35:30]  It was an amazing  Cultural experience  And it truly was  A cultural exchange  I feel like we  As individuals  Forget about Audio Slave  The band  Or the marquee  But just as four guys  Going in there  And being musicians  And artists  And seeing  That side of Cuba  Was phenomenal  It was incredible  And I hope  I feel like  Some of that does get  On the DVD  So I think that  I also think  As a U.S. citizen  That doesn't get 
[02:36:00]  The kind of information  That other countries  May get  In terms of  News media  About Cuba  Watching the DVD  Will be a good thing  Because  I can speak for myself  I've never been there before  And the only images  I have of Cuba  And the Cuban people  Are the giant  Flotilla shots  They show on the news  Of people desperate  To leave  So that they  Put themselves  And their grandparents  And their children  In peril  And try to float  Across the water 
[02:36:30]  To Florida  But you get there  And it's anything  But that feeling  And it's also  It doesn't give you  The vacation resort  Island spot feeling  Either  Because it hasn't been  Co-opted by huge  Corporations  And I've been to  A lot of  Vacation spots  Like that too  And you don't feel  Like you're  In a zone  Where  The actual people  That live there  Run things  Yeah you're not  Having a taste  Of the real culture  They don't own anything 
[02:37:00]  Yeah  They're the ones  That become the maids  And the dishwashers  And you didn't get  That feeling either  These are proud people  That live in a country  That they are proud  To be in  And they're not  In by the tens  And thousands  Trying to float away  So in general  You think they're  Happy over there  I've got the feeling  That they were  Extremely resourceful  And happy  In a way that 
[02:37:30]  In my life  Right now  I can actually  Be influenced by  Because as Americans  We're constantly  Inundated with new ways  To be distracted  And it's referred to  As entertainment  Like go see the new  Batman movie  Check out the new  PlayStation game  Check out  We have this new  Drug you can smoke  And all that stuff  And people really  Without the types  Of distractions 
[02:38:00]  That we have  Particularly the  Commercial ones  Were standing around  Playing music at night  Having a good time  Enjoying the company  Of other people  Enjoying art forms  Music  Literature  In ways that  Probably has not  Been going on  In this country  For a long long time  And I think that  That is more rewarding  Than sitting out  And zoning out  Playing PlayStation  Which is  Something that  I'm guilty of doing  Yeah  So I value  Family 
[02:38:30]  And my relationships  With my family  And my band  And the people  Close to me  And that  You feel that  With the Cuban  People  As soon as  You land  Yeah we just  Kind of look at it  Like oh wow  They're impoverished  So they obviously  Don't have any fun  They have nothing  To do  And you know  You just kind of  Put it in a nutshell  There about  It's not always  About that  That's pretty cool  You know  As a U.S. citizen  You get a little  Slap in the face  When you get there  With that  Which is you know 
[02:39:00]  The U.S. embargoes  Is what  Is creating  That poverty  And yet  You're not seeing  A bunch of  Desperate people  You're seeing people  Who are incredibly  Resourceful  Well educated  People doing  Amazing things  And are happy  You know  In the face of  Since before  I was born  Some pretty dire  Poverty  And lack of resources  And it's kind of  You can't help  But be stood up  By that  And think  My God  These are  Amazing  Country and culture  I think the 
[02:39:30]  Embargo is kind of  A double edged sword  In that respect  Because if  If it ever stopped  There would probably  Be a huge  American influence  Down there  And the culture  Would start to suffer  Because they'd have  Access to a lot  Of those distractions  I heard Timmy  Mentioning Coke  And Pepsi  And it'll be  McDonald's  And Burger King  And IBM  And Starbucks  But you know  What it would be  It would be a resort  And a resort  It would be a resort  And there would be  A bunch of people  On the beach 
[02:40:00]  And they wouldn't  Be Cuban  And it would suck  You would be  What it was  In the 50s  You'd drive through  The impoverished  Neighborhood  Like you'd do  To get to Atlantis  Or something  And that's  One of the highlights  Of the trip  Was we went to  A music university  That used to be  In the pre-revolutionary  Days was an  Elitist country club  Where like the  Rich people from  Other countries  Would come  And the mafia  You know  People would come  And play golf  And drink champagne  And what not  And I'm sure  The Cuban  And I'm sure  The Cuban people  There were  Cleaning up 
[02:40:30]  After them  And now it's  A free music school  For any  Young Cuban person  That shows talent  In the arts  Gets to go there  For free  And get a complete  Education there  And we went there  And saw some  Young jazz musicians  Play some of the most  Jaw-droppingly amazing  Music we've ever seen  But they may not  Ever be heard  But it was really  Incredible  But due to the  Embargo  They don't have  Enough guitar strings  And bass strings  And drumsticks  And things like that  So that was  One of the  Ironies 
[02:41:00]  Can't they get it  From other places  Though  Like Europe  No no  It's not  An embargo  It's basically  A blockade  Like the United States  Just says  You may not do  Business with Cuba  You know  Like if you're  France  And want to  Send over  A boatload  Of guitar strings  We will sink  Your ship  Or if you want  To send over  Cancer medicine  For children  With cancer there  We will sink your ship  That may not  Come in either  So those are  Some of the things  Has the US  Ever sunk a ship  They don't  They don't need to  Because  Because people  You know  There's a big enough 
[02:41:30]  Stick wheel  It's like  If you deal with them  Then you're  Not getting this  You know  It's one of those things  Yeah you could do  Business  Go ahead  Do business with them  Then we won't  Send you this  Exactly  And the United States  Is a much  More lucrative  Trading partner  Those countries  Aren't afraid  To deal with Iran  They're not afraid  To deal with Iraq  Or other countries  They're not  Communists  But you know  What I'm saying  We have more  And Cuba doesn't have oil  Either  You know  Which is one of the reasons  Which Iran and Iraq do  You know  There's not  They have sugar cane  And there have been  Actual physical blockade standoffs 
[02:42:00]  Ship to ship standoffs  Where no one  No one was sunk  But  But it's  It's happened  They came after us  When we were floating across  There was definitely  An incident  We brought mirrors though  And it was  We were able to  Reflect the ocean  And so it was like  Ocean camo  We brought mirrors  Sick that we went  Right between them  Suddenly that just  Sounded genius  That whole mirror  Camouflage thing  Is like  It's almost predator  Yeah 
[02:42:30]  Great bro  We brought mirrors  I like that  We can do anything  With the right  Combination of mirrors  Brilliant  Alright they're saying  We gotta wrap up  Because you guys  Got somewhere else  To go at 10 o'clock  Ben is that true  It's Audioslave live  In Cuba  Any final thoughts  About Cuba  Or anything  What's going on  Watch the DVD  It was amazing  Did you guys bring us  Any cigars  No the state department  When we landed  In the port of entry 
[02:43:00]  They had a very  Very close look  For cigars  A lot of people  You could go to the resorts  You could bring them back  And stuff  And it's not that big a deal  But I bet they just  You know  Checked you guys out  Very careful  Very well  We're also on tour  By the way  We're a band  That's on tour  In North America  Playing some rock and roll  Shows around this  A lot of people  Are asking  Do you play Rage  Yes you guys  Are playing everything  You're playing  Audioslave  You're playing  The Soundgarden  And you're playing  The Rage Against the Machine  Yeah even some  Temple of the Dog  We've been rocking  Really  Yeah  Which one  We're going to be  Doing all of that  At the Madison Square Garden  Say hello to heaven 
[02:43:30]  Yeah Madison Square Garden  Is on the 29th  But this show  Goes everywhere right  So just check out  Audioslave.com  Which Temple of the Dog  Songs  We've done  All Night Thing  We've done  Hunger Strike  Hunger Strike  We've done  Call Me A Dog  Call Me A Dog  Yeah  Chris did you know  Andrew Wood  Yeah he was my roommate  Was he really  I thought  I happened to bump into him  A couple times  Who are you  Get a haircut  I absolutely loved  Mother Love Bone 
[02:44:00]  Yeah  Me too  That record was a jam  I still play that  Yeah yeah yeah  I think that was  A very influential record  On rock actually  And I  I've always felt like  His death  In a weird way  Affected rock music  Because I think  Mother Love Bone  Was kind of a bridge  Between  Like the commercial  Hair metal bands  Of the 80's  And Nirvana  In a sense  You can hear it  On the record  And when that bridge  Was gone  After he died  That bridge was gone  And then it was  Much more polarized  Yep  Because it was okay 
[02:44:30]  Like Mother Love Bone  Still was cool  And the quality  Was incredible  Of the songwriting  And yet there were  Fancy outfits  And yet they wore  Fancy outfits  They would pout  And they would wear  Big hats  And stuff  In a photo shoot  It is right in the middle  Between the hair band  And the grunge  Without a doubt  And I'm psyched  Because XM  Is playing Mother Love Bone  Because commercial radio  Doesn't even touch  Mother Love Bone  Which I think is a shame  I do too  I do too  So whose idea was it  To do the Temple of the Dog  After he  Did what he did there  It was a long 
[02:45:00]  Sort of strange process  I wrote  Two songs  Sailor to Heaven  And reached down  And did  I demoed them  Like on a four track  At home  And then I had this idea  For a second  Of maybe I'll get  The other members  Of Mother Love Bone  Together  And we can go do this  As a single  And then I thought  Well they'll never  Want to do that  And it's a bad idea  And then somehow  Or another  They got the tape  And called me up  And then the idea  Was we'll do that  And we'll do a couple  More songs  And we'll do some  Of Andy's solo songs  That no one's ever heard 
[02:45:30]  And we'll cover them  And then his family  And friends got really  Uptight about that  Like somehow  We were stealing  His songs  And it wasn't  A time to have  Weird feelings  And at the time  I just wrote  A bunch more songs  For it  And Stone Gossard  Now the guitar player  Of Pearl Jam  Had a few things  That he was working on  And I wrote lyrics  To that  And we just made  Our own record  And all original material  And put it out  Man it's  I love Temple of the Dog  Oh yeah  Sorry to go off  On that tangent  It's alright  We love it too 
[02:46:00]  And it's awesome  To be rocking those jams  That helped  This band exist too  Because I had  Such a good time  Going in with a group  Of people that I did not know  And it was such  A positive experience  That I had  A positive attitude  About possibly  Getting in a room  With these three guys  And having it be great  Which it was  From the moment  That I stepped on stage  Like there was a guitar  And an amp on stage  I picked it up  For two seconds  Realized we were worse  If I played it  And then we started  Coming up with stuff  And these three guys 
[02:46:30]  Sounded unbelievable  And me singing over it  Sounded like Audioslave  And it was great  From day one  Awesome  Alright with that  We gotta wrap up  Guys thanks man  Thanks very much  It's Audioslave  The new DVD is live in Cuba  I'm going home  And watching this today  I can't wait  And you guys are  Touring all over the place  Website for the tour dates  Because we're heard  All over America  Audioslave.com  Audioslave.com  For tour dates  And they're playing  Everything from Audioslave  To Soundgarden  To Rage Against the Machine  Thanks guys  Thanks for having us  Thanks a lot  Thank you  Gather round the campfire kids

I don't know  Elvis  Some kind of magic  Weird shit  We got married at Graceland  You see a vision  Get married  Lose all your shit  No Graceland is bizarre  To get married to men  They have all these  You got married in Graceland?  In Graceland  Yeah  All right  At the little chapel  Behind in his backyard 
[02:47:30]  Or whatever  And as you go all through Graceland  They have all these fucking rocks  That are like you know  Fake rocks  Fake things that have speakers in it  That whenever you pass by the rock  It has some kind of motion sensor  And it says Elvis thing  So you think you're losing  Your fucking mind  The whole time of walking around there  Elvis?  You're like  Hey man don't worry  It's going to be okay  It's all going to be okay man  Go ahead and get married man  It's all right  Seriously  This is a true story  All right  So we're at the altar  At the little chapel  Me and Angie  And I'm sweating 
[02:48:00]  Because I've already had  One really ruinous  Failed horrible  Shitty ass marriage  Why would you do it again?  Well  Because she's great  Okay  But  And not only that  We're at Graceland  I got caught up in the moment  And I'm really glad I did  But at any rate  I'm at the altar  So I go look  I got to take a piss  I got to take a piss  So I left Angie at the altar  Went to go take a piss  And in the actual bathroom  Next to the altar  There's an escape door  Get out of here  Guys I swear to God 
[02:48:30]  There's an escape door  In case you just want to like  Bolt at the last second  Does that rock say  Run man  Just run  No no  So I'm in there  Looking at the door  I'm throwing water on my face  Because I'm kind of like  Man do I really want to do this  I don't know  And I'm looking at the escape  Door in the back  Which is open  I check  So you can haul ass  And run right  And I'm throwing water  In my face  All of a sudden  I hear through the speakers  Sorry man  It's all going to be okay  And they do that shit  On purpose  I swear  I talked to  Wow

[02:49:30]  That was really cool man  Audio slave  Audio slave in studio today  We're starting to get real guests 
[02:50:00]  That would definitely qualify  How much gas do you think  That Chris Cornell got  In his whole career  Jesus  Lead singer  Got the god damn voice  Just looks like a rock star  And he's a handsome man  Looks like a rock star  Bastard  I had no idea he was that tall  Yeah he's really tall  He's got to be like 6'4  Big hands  Probably has a cock to his knee  Fiercely depressing  For a comedian to look over  And see that  You have gifts Jimmy? 
[02:50:30]  What?  Jimmy has gifts?  Oh I thought Jimmy brought us gifts  That's what I thought you meant  I was panicking  I'm like I certainly didn't  Oh we're giving him gifts?  Yeah  Here's our reality  By the way  Here's one instant feedback  And then the one right below it  Get audio slave back  This has been the best show  You've done on XM  Keep up the good work  Very next one 
[02:51:00]  Hey fuckheads  That interview with audio slave sucked  That's what we live every day  That's our reality  You know what I always say guys  You can't win for losing  Ah  That's right  This is the new Jim Norton  No more anger  Regular Joe Jimmy  Oh look at what you got  Yeah  You got a happy birthday bouquet  Not his fucking birthday  What?  It's you know it's cute and all  When they call and say happy birthday  They're sending him stuff 
[02:51:30]  Who is this from?  Oh you know what this is  This is from  This is from Johnny  He got the part  What is this?  Take it away  I don't know shit about Cuba  Now I  None of us really do  And now I'm going to go home  And watch the DVD  Audio slave in Cuba  Let me tell you something about Cuba  And I've never been there  Jeffrey Ross went  I was trying to bring that point up  That was the first time I knew  That as Americans  You could actually go to Cuba  I had no idea  I thought you just weren't allowed 
[02:52:00]  They would shoot you  As soon as you  As soon as you set foot on their soil  You know what you're doing  Before you dig into that yogurt?  What?  You're learning about Cuba  Eating some food  That's right  I had no idea  But Jeffrey Ross said  No you could go to Cuba  I'm like what?  You have to go through Canada  He went through Canada  And stuff  Or you could go like  But I think in order to work  Like they were working  They were doing a gig  Yeah  Then you got to go through  The State Department  There has to be  One of my managers  This is allegedly gone  With some very very high ups 
[02:52:30]  In this business  And gotten photos with Castro  That are in his office  Castro?  Yeah  One of my managers  Is a psychopath genius  Who actually introduced Castro to people  Because  Let me tell you something  He speaks Spanish  The Castro photo blows away anything  Either of you motherfuckers got  Blows away Bill Clinton  I still got Jimmy Beat  You got Jimmy Beat  My Clinton photo is much better than you  I just got a Joe Mantegna  I got Joe Mantegna  And I also got all four Sabbath members signed 
[02:53:00]  All four  So you know what?  Fidel can eat my American  Red, white, and blue hiney  Fidel would be a rough one  There's a picture of my manager  Of all of us  Of Jonathan leaning over  Like talking to Fidel  Wow  Yeah Jonathan is a psychopath  Oh he's a kook  With a big bulge in his pants  Really makes me sick  And he moans when he eats sushi  Does he?  Oh god  Oh he talks to them  That is creepy  Yeah when we were all sitting there  At that place in LA  He just  Oh my  He's one of these guys  Oh my god  Oh he's a salmon  I'm like alright calm down dude 
[02:53:30]  Yeah he really is a psycho  But what were we saying?  Cuba  I had no idea  Yeah  There's no surprise that  Fidel Castro and the gang down there  Picked a band that's very anti-establishment  Oh yeah yeah  I mean they're not going to invite  A country band down there anytime soon  No  It's pretty obvious  If you're going to invite  The first rock band from America  Down to play  It's going to be someone like  You know  Audioslave  Yeah  They do make a good point  I'm kind of bummed  Because I wanted to get into 
[02:54:00]  Chris Cornell's political views  Because he stepped into a band  That was quite political  I don't think he's as political as they are  No that's what I wanted to get at  And you can tell the music  Isn't as political  Right  It's more  Yeah they're obviously  Having more fun  And not trying to make huge statements  Chris just comes off like  Hey  I'm a singer  I'm having a great time  Go fuck yourself  It's great  Rockstar  Let's go to Atlanta  Nicky says we're full of shit  Or Audioslave is full of shit  All right  Nicky go ahead  What's up brother  No you're not full of shit  I was just saying  Them saying the embargo 
[02:54:30]  Is fucking the reason  Why there's not medicine  And stuff  Fidel Castro is a billionaire  And he keeps those people down  I just thought  It was kind of  Cheesy  That they were  Blaming it on us  Having boats out there  It's not true  And I just don't  I think any kind of  Ignorance out there is bad  I can't picture  American warships  Facing down  French and German  Warships  No it's more of a  You do business with them  You don't do business with us  Kind of deal  That they got with Cuba  And both sides  Have their propaganda 
[02:55:00]  That goes back and forth  We have an impression of Cuba  That really is just based  On what we know here  And don't know there  They really did  Kind of open my eyes up  To the whole fact that  You know  They have a community down there  I've always been from  The school of thought  That if you're an  Impoverished nation  You're miserable  And want to get out  But it seems like  They're brought closer  Together as families  And just like you said  People playing music  On the streets  And talking with each other  Because they have  No fucking job  No no 
[02:55:30]  I realize that  I realize that  But what they  What they are saying  Is it's not  That important to them  It's not as important  To them as it is  To us  And not as  As high up on the ladder  That's because they don't  Know what they're missing  Yes they don't have it  Well maybe  They have no idea  What they're missing  They don't really know  What American culture is all about  But they could say  That we don't know  What we're missing  Yes we do  Like they could sit and  There's no question  That their family is better  Their values are better  Because they don't know  That the kids aren't  Playing Xbox  They're playing soccer 
[02:56:00]  With their dad  But dude they're  Pushing for $10 a month  And they're risking  Their lives to float over here  Yeah  That's a big statement  They're risking their lives  To float here  Across the ocean  They're making boats  Out of cabs  Yeah  But it's not  But that's all we know  About Cuba  That's what those guys said  That's all we know  I mean are there  Other people there  That are just very happy  With the lives  They got in Cuba  And don't know any better  Do they have better  Family values  You fail talking  You fail talking on the phone sir  You're the second failure today 
[02:56:30]  My god  People are failing  At talking on the phone with us  You're a good point  And good point  That's why we haven't  Gone to the phones lately  You guys have really  Really let us down  Opie's talking sir  And I don't make good points  Very often  Yes you do  There was a point  That I think was going to be good  Go ahead  I think I had a good point  Make it  Go on and make it  I wonder about  Their family values  And if they have  Better family values  And better family structures  Because they're  They're not caught up  With the play station  And they're watching the movies 
[02:57:00]  And all that shit  That point stunk  I mean you wonder though  I mean you know  I think you really have to  Be a parent that  You can't just  Oh my god  You know throw your kid  In front of a play station  All afternoon  I'm just saying  I couldn't imagine  But I don't know  I'm not going to sit here  I don't know either  I have no fucking idea  I couldn't imagine  Being down there  Living like that  And enjoying myself  Or having any good time  But they on the other hand  Might look at the way we live  And think  My god  They don't spend any time 
[02:57:30]  As a family together  They you know  They're so individualized  Everybody's very  We're very self-centered  In this country  You know what I mean  We got our stuff to do  And we do it  And we got our toys  That we want and get  And they're down there  You know  Making do it  What they have  But you know  Kind of a better thing  In one way  Comes out of that  Right  Not that I want to go down there  Fuck that  I like my toys  Let's go to Paul in St. Louis  Paul  Fidel  Hey  What's going on guys 
[02:58:00]  Hey man  Hey this is the first time  I've ever called you  It's totally cool  Those guys sound like  They were like  On the payroll  For Fidel's  Ministry of Information  That crap that they were saying  About some blockade  That's the biggest  Bunch of garbage  I've ever heard about Cuba  I've got friends  That have been there  Yeah  I go to Canada weekly  They've got billboards up  And you can fly out of Canada  You can fly from Mexico City  It's very well known  You know  You can  It's just ridiculous 
[02:58:30]  That stuff about  Not getting drugs  And medicine  And the US will sink ships  That's just a bunch of crap  Nah  That ain't  I can't see the  I can't see the United States  Sinking a cancer medicine ship  I'm sorry  And I'm not being  Mr. Pete pro-government  I know the government's dirty  But I can't see them saying  They were  Listen  They were  This phone is driving me nuts  But I wish Rage had stayed  Because those guys had stayed  Because the point I was thinking of  Was we allowed  The US had lifted the embargo 
[02:59:00]  And the food for  Oil for medicine thing  That Saddam  Was obviously stealing  All the money from himself  But they allowed Iraq  To have the embargo  Lifted partially  To sell some oil  So they could get medicine  And supply  So I don't want to hear  That they're sinking cancer boats  I don't picture the US going  There's some sick children  Sink that boat full of medicine  Fire one  Do you think if you're  If you're the captain  Of the cancer medicine boat  That you make sure  It's written on the side  Cancer medicine boat  In big red letters  Right  Yeah  Of course you do  You even have a flag  With a coughing person on it 
[02:59:30]  Just in case  There's a different language  A little  No eyebrow kid  With a bandana  Around his head  A bald five year old  Trying to smile  Instead of having a flag  It's just a robe  Just fluttering  Just a tattered quilt  That's it  Tattered quilt  A flag with two sad parents on it  Sir I'm looking through  The periscope here  With the smokestacks  Just coughing  Should I think  Fire  With the smokestacks  Just coughing black smoke  Every  Just cause it can  Oh  That's horrible 
[03:00:00]  I don't know  I don't know shit about Cuba  It was very interesting  To have those guys in  A lot of people asking  Why didn't Audioslave play  Well  Because  We still have cubicles  Yeah  It's hard to set up  In the cubicles  Once we have  Ripping off  Ronnie  Cubicles  I'm blaming the cubicles  Hey buddy  Hey Fez  Hey Fez  A lot of wires  You know  I don't want  I don't want Don  Or Elo  Or XM  Telling me anything  Until it's absolutely true 
[03:00:30]  Or Hawk  Happening  I don't want to hear  We're going to get rid of the cubicles  Just tell me when it's done  Get him out  It was supposed to be done  By the beginning of summer  Then it was supposed to be  By fall  Well fall is here  And I don't see any  Construction going on  Around here  Get going  Get cracking  Now they're saying sometime in 06  Okay  I don't want to hear anything anymore  When it actually happens  Then send me a nice email  On my Blackberry  Saying  Boom this is happening  Hey did you notice  The cubicles are gone  A lot of empty promises  Right

[03:18:30]  In New York?  Yeah, I speed, I pay no attention to rules, to signs, to things  I go point A, point B, I'm getting there, I don't care what I gotta do  I find that New York City cops don't pull you over often  They don't a lot, but some of the shit I do is really stupid  Like I'll drive on a fucking sidewalk, I've done it  In the city  Yeah, I was going through Queens just the other day  I got over the bridge  And I'm trying to get onto the road that goes to the entrance ramp 
[03:19:00]  And the tractor trailer decided he was going to try to turn from under the expressway overpass in Queens  And couldn't make the turn  Now he can't back up because there's cars that were right on the truck's ass  The truck is stuck blocking every lane of traffic  The car's trying to get to the expressway  What'd you do?  I looked, I saw there was one parking space open  That revealed the curb and the sidewalk 
[03:19:30]  So, I popped the curb  I've been in the car with Anthony  I've seen him take the curb many times  And I drove on the sidewalk for about  I don't know  Two, no, about a block  Until I could get around the truck back onto the road  But then I had to find another open parking space to get back onto the street  And that took me a little further than the truck  So, I'm just driving down the sidewalk  Then I popped back on  And that's it  You know, there's something I know about Anthony 
[03:20:00]  Like, over these few years I've known you guys  Yeah  You see pictures of you guys  Anthony looks like a disturbed guy  Like, you know, like one of these sociopaths, right?  But you know what?  He's really an outraged white guy  Like, I never realized  It was one day I came and he was complaining about computers  And no one was customer servicing him  And I was like, you know, and to this story  You're just like an outraged  You're right  Bye, bye, bye, bye  Bye, bye, bye  I shouldn't have to  I shouldn't have to  Officer, I'm driving 
[03:20:30]  How dare you  Anthony really is outraged  You are right  I am an outraged white guy  You are really  And I don't even look the far  You're right  An entitled guy  I didn't realize  Like, you look like  Anthony, let's go, man  Let's get out  Let's rob this bank real quick  Come on  Why would you  I have my accessor in this very establishment  Patrice  Why would I want to disturb  That really was an entitled story 
[03:21:00]  I drove up on a sidewalk  Oh, yeah  Because he qualified it  With the tractor trailer  Blocking up progress  I have things to do  People to see  I pay you taxes to why  This should be more highway and not sidewalk  Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why  You are so fucking right  Oh, my God, he is right  He is nuts, he is nuts  Yeah, I look like a lunatic  You do tell like you're entitled to  You're right  That's the name of the game

[03:32:00]  Retard Island  Is not going to be  Retard Island  If anything  If anything  They'd want to  Make that produce  And expand  Right  Just have the retards  Take over  Opie go over one day  Spend a day with them  On that island  See what it's like  It's awful  I used to date a girl  Who lived there  Football  Really?  It's awful  Stop it  It's awful  Roosevelt Island  They actually wear  Their special Olympic medals  Really?  Yeah  They strut  Down the island  Down Main Street  Is it all self sufficient  Like is there a grocery store there?  One each  There's one of everything  One of everything  There's like one restaurant  One grocery store  One diner 
[03:32:30]  I was there once  One barbershop  One church  Is there like a little town  Like a little area  Sort of  Yeah which is Main Street  That runs down the center of the island  You are not of the body  Landru  Landru will hear you  For the rest of the country  You've got to explain though  Manhattan  Obviously everyone knows Manhattan  And it's this tiny island  That looks like  In the middle of the East River  And it's in the East River  Between Manhattan and Queens  And there's no one that lives there really  Compared to Manhattan  If you read the history of it  They used to ban people from Manhattan  There was a jail there  There was a smallpox hospital 
[03:33:00]  There was an insane asylum  Typhoid Mary was there  Yeah  Typhoid Mary  So like if somebody had a disease or whatever  They didn't know what to do with them  They would put them on a rowboat  Send them over to Fezz's Island  To eventually die  And then burn the boat  Of course  You don't want disease coming back in it  You don't pull that thing back  No  Why would you live there?  I like it  I like it  I figured I could turn the retards into my minions  I could be king  I could be the bully in the neighborhood  Yeah  If you're the top dog  There  You've got kind of an army of darkness 
[03:33:30]  So  Exactly what it is  I got on the Roosevelt Island bus the other day  And some retard  Just four sides white  Just there  And right in my face  You know  Face to face  Oh boy  He sits down next to me  And he looks at me  And he goes  We gotta get rid of Bush  Holy shit  Wow  Even them  Yeah  Even there  Even them  He is now on Roosevelt Island  He's losing support with all his key groups  He had a moment of clarity  So this stuff is freaking you out  The orange alerts and everything  Everything  Yeah  Now what's freakier though 
[03:34:00]  Are these death dreams  I'm hearing about  That's crazy  Now I'm listening  And I'm hearing  He's been having dreams  That he's gonna die  When is it?  October 27th?  23rd  23rd  Thank you for saying 27th  Four days  It's like a lottery  You fill out the wrong numbers  And you gotta play both  Now he's gonna make it through the 23rd  And go  I gotta get through the 27th now  Thanks  Sorry about that  23rd  And he's been dreaming  That he's gonna be killed actually  Yeah  Five death dreams 
[03:34:30]  In probably the past six weeks  And is this  And it's death and destruction  And I'm just seeing  Horrible horrible scenes  Like crushed by a bus  Yeah  Crushed by a bus is what I was told  By who?  The person in the dream  Oh  So now what if you stay home?  Jerome Bettis will knock on my door  And hit me  No matter what happens  You still feel like you're gonna die  Yeah  Yeah I don't feel like anything's safe  Wow  Why October 23rd?  Is that someone's birthday?  I have no idea what October 23rd means 
[03:35:00]  That's just what they say in the dream  And then I like see it like written down too  Oh boy  What are you gonna do on that day?  What is your plan for the day?  I may just stay in  You just stay in  It's a Sunday  Yeah right  It's a Sunday?  Well that's good  Yeah  Sunday bloody Sunday  Oh boy  So your death won't even be televised?  That sucked  That'll be Monday  Monday  That'll be Monday to talk about it  There's Monday show  I'm gonna do death therapy with it  Yeah  That day  There will be the post death show on Monday  That'd be great  Wow 
[03:35:30]  Can you imagine everybody tuning in to hear me crying?  And you know just pulling back  Oh no  His real name was  One of those shows  Let me tell you something about the guy I know  The guy away from the microphone  Oh my god  Would you actually do that?  Born in Pinellas Park, Florida  And he's gonna  You're gonna be buried in your favorite place of Virginia  No I don't wanna be  Northern Virginia  Back where he loves  Northern Virginia  Back where you love  Do not let me be buried in Northern Virginia  Virginia  In Fairfax  You gotta be kidding me 
[03:36:00]  Little cemetery overlooks JFK  Put him up there on the hill  I heard you telling him you were gonna have him buried there  And he said he will crawl out of his grave and track you down  I will be zombie fez  And just dig my way out if I'm buried in Fairfax  Jesus Christ  Well that's scary  If he dies then we're all gonna be really weirded out by it  Totally  Yeah  And maybe then we'll start believing in God  Totally weirded out  Because he always dreams  Right  Although you can kind of think 
[03:36:30]  Maybe he got so worked up about it  Like did you ever see the Twilight episode?  Right  That guy that went  He had to go to the grave  Of the guy he killed  And stick the knife in the grave  To prove that he wasn't afraid  And what he did was  He went to the grave  And it was very windy  And he stuck the knife in the grave  And they cut it off at that point  Then they went up the next day  And found him dead on the grave  And it turned out  That when he stuck  The knife in the grave 
[03:37:00]  His big trench coat  Had blown at that moment  And he had stuck it to the grave  So when he got up  To walk away  He felt something tug at his jacket  From the grave  Not knowing he had stuck  And he had a heart attack  Right there and died  That's all you're gonna do  Scare yourself to death  So perhaps you're gonna  Scare yourself  It's true  Right it's a true story  Pitiful portrait  Those used to scare the shit out of me  Night gallery  Oh night gallery was scary  I think it was even scarier 
[03:37:30]  Than the twilight zone  Yeah  Yeah with that horrible  Little art gallery  With the stupid paintings in there  So something could happen  Just out of his own fear  I mean  Yeah  How much stress he puts on himself  How much can his heart take  Yeah I could walk out  In front of a bus  Just not paying attention  Just being too careful  Not to step on cracks  On the sidewalk  So preoccupied  Yes  What's happening with the men's room too  I was leaving yesterday  And you were freaked out  Because you had to go to the bathroom  Oh yeah  Well I'm  P-shy  Yeah  He doesn't like anybody in there 
[03:38:00]  So Master Poe  Is nice enough to volunteer  To watch the door  Oh god  I just can't  I can't go in a bathroom  When someone else is in there  You have duty issues  Or pee-pee issues  Like  Both issues  Poo-poo is out of the question  No he won't take it  Only home  Yeah  Not even  Even there you cry  The whole time you're doing it  I put a towel over my head  To hide the shame  What's wrong with me  I can smell it  I'm so dirty  I'm filthy  Like there's a listening device 
[03:38:30]  In my bathroom  See the thing is  We can't judge him  Because none of us  Have been fucked by our uncles  If we were  If we were  Maybe we'd have those problems  Oh yeah  That could be  Should we pull the curtain back on that  And tell the truth too fast  Yikes  That's  Leave the curtain where it's at  He's afraid to go to weddings  Because he might be there  Oh he might turn up  He's dead now  Oh is he  Oh good  Why don't you go  Stick a knife in his grave  To prove that you're not afraid anymore  He went there once  And put a dick in the grave  To stab it right through
