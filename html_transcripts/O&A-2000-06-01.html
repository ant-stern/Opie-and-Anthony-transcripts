<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a lengthy discussion about the fallout from "the A-bomb" incident, a controversial on-air stunt.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, speculated about potential disciplinary action, ranging from suspension to termination, and analyzed listener and management reactions.  This segment also extensively covered the damage to their "WOW" van, caused by Spaz, a show employee, who crashed it at a "WOW sticker stop." Spaz, present in the studio, defended himself, claiming it was an accident.  Mike, a garage employee, also contributed, with damage estimates ranging from $2000 to $3000.  The discussion included listener calls, debates about the extent of the damage, and speculation about a potential future "H-bomb" incident.  They briefly touched upon the New York Knicks game and the online availability of the "A-bomb" recording.  The segment concluded with promotion of an upcoming "WOW sticker stop" and Stacker 2.


The show continued with further discussion of Spaz's van accident.  A damage appraiser, Anthony, who witnessed the incident, called in with an estimate of $1,057.57.  The hosts and callers mocked Spaz's ludicrous plan to repair the damage using only paint, a brush, and tape.  This led to tangents: a proposed driving competition between Spaz and a blind man, Dave; Spaz's lack of car insurance; and the high cost of his DIY repair.  The conversation took a shocking turn with a graphic and extended discussion about Gary Glitter's child sex offenses and his attempts to contact a young girl, interspersed with Glitter's music.  Other tangents included pictures of Anna Kournikova and listener calls about their experiences with the "WOW" sticker promotion.  The segment concluded with sponsor promotions and further discussion of the "A-bomb" aftermath.


Next, a bizarre discussion ensued about the size of a basket, escalating to absurd hypotheticals about fitting a person inside, including being cut in half.  This transitioned into a discussion of the show's ratings, specifically a significant spike coinciding with the mention of the "A-bomb" (later renamed "C-bomb") stunt.  Caller Frank provided ratings data confirming a substantial viewership increase. The hosts discussed the reaction from competing news channels.


The show then delved into a highly explicit and offensive segment featuring numerous listener calls focused on Jamaican men and their penises.  "Jamaican Mike," a studio guest, participated in these conversations, which often used crude and sexually graphic language. Callers shared personal anecdotes, including experiences at Hedonism resort.  Barbara, a caller, detailed her positive experiences in Jamaica leading to marriage with a Jamaican man.  The segment included a game called "What's in My Pants" with a female caller.  The conversation also included unrelated topics: a caller's story from the Kentucky Fried Movie and another about Patrick Swayze surviving a plane crash.  Listener calls about the "A-bomb" incident were also interspersed throughout.  Earl, associated with a "WOW" sticker event, who had previously threatened to quit, also called in to apologize.  The show concluded with a "What Did We Learn" segment, with callers summarizing their takeaways from the broadcast, mostly centered on Jamaica and often using humorous and inappropriate language.  Spaz's "Week in Review" segment ended comically with his admission of not being prepared.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  O.B. You guys are God and Anthony.  Wait two minutes, we'll say something really dumb.  101, 7, number 3, number 3.  Virgin.  Okay, brother.  Virgin.  Oh boy, terrific.  Bonzo.  And we...  Go! 
[00:00:30]  Good birthday.  Hey man.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Let me laugh, let me laugh, let me laugh.  Let me laugh.  I got it from a needle. 
[00:01:00]  It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Well, ladies and gentlemen.  Hey.  We survived.  Hey, we're here.  Stupid New York radio message board.  Isn't that funny?  Not suspended asses.  What a bunch of douchebags.  A bunch of tools.  Who was it?  Dan say... 
[00:01:30]  Dan say...  A friend of mine at Wins called me and told me...  Shut up!  You guys make me laugh my damn bag off.  Pusser!  Shut up!  I was laughing my yam bag off.  Suspended.  Get out of here.  Oh, and I will be doing the entire show standing up, if you know what I mean.  Yeah.  But suspended, I mean...  A little harsh, right? 
[00:02:00]  Right, Dan?  Of course.  Right?  There's the usual suspects on that message board that's just like, don't get it.  They're so friggin'...  They know exactly what's going on.  All their little behind-the-scenes friends in radio.  They're all just like, yeah, I know.  Oh, once this one hears about this and that...  Shut up!  Shut up!  Kiss my ass!  Oh!  Go discuss what the saddest moment on the air was. 
[00:02:30]  Go do that.  Leave us and our listeners alone.  I was happy we hadn't been on that board in quite a while, and it was good.  Oof.  But then they all got to speculate when we do something.  Oh, my God.  It's been a wild 20 hours, I'll say that much.  Oh, man.  It was pretty intense down the hall, I'll say that much. 
[00:03:00]  Ow.  But I think we might have skated on this one, Anthony.  For now.  For now.  For now.  We'll see.  Oh.  I was a little too close for comfort, don't you think?  Woo-hoo!  Someone should have been the sensible one.  See, we're a team, Opie, so one of us, you know, is like a safety for the other one.  My friend, I blame you.  Why me?  I blame you for the whole damn thing.  Come on!  Because when the atom bomb was about to be dropped yesterday, on our radio show, I'll 
[00:03:30]  go on record and say that I was having some second thoughts.  You were.  And that's when the boss came sprinting down the hallway, because he goes, when I hear  that Oaf has second thoughts on the radio, then I know it's really, really bad.  It might be bad, yeah.  And in the old life, that is, Anthony, you were a little more conservative, Anthony.  You were the voice of reason for our show.  You were so gung-ho yesterday, it scares me.  Sometimes.  I am going to go on record and say that you, my friend, are going to get us fired someday. 
[00:04:00]  No, believe me, you are the one.  You are completely out of control.  You are the one.  I'm living this new groovy, you know, lifestyle, and you don't give an F anymore.  Groovy lifestyle.  What's my groovy lifestyle?  That's cool.  Yeah, well, hey, I wanted to, you know, I wanted to be part of it yesterday, so I didn't say  anything as far as, I got really scared when it was going down. 
[00:04:30]  And I'm like, oh, I just saw our whole lives flash before our eyes again.  I'm like, oh, this situation's a little familiar to me.  Ouch.  I've been here before.  Ouch.  Everything going along just fine, and next thing, we're, we're screwed.  So, I don't think it's over, though.  No.  No, not yet.  Did someone get me a really soft pillow so I could sit down today? 
[00:05:00]  Hey, it happens.  I mean, you know, that's what we're on the air for.  All right, phone line 212-757-1027.  Roger, what's going on?  General Francis.  General Surgeon.  Yeah.  Congratulations on yesterday's mission.  Well, you know, there'll always be some flack, some fallout when you have something like 
[00:05:30]  the A-bomb.  Well, I'm happy to see that you're on the air this morning and there's no slappy and  whappy afternoon show.  I mean, 50 years, over 50 years after, well, just about 50 years after the A-bomb in Japan,  they're still bringing it up like a bad thing.  So, you know, you can't expect it to go away in a day.  There will be kids born with stumpy arms because of what we did yesterday.  Stumpy arms. 
[00:06:00]  Great show again today, guys.  Syndication, syndication.  I can still hear you.  Go, Nick!  You know, at this point, screw syndication.  I just want to keep my job.  Yeah.  We'll just, we'll be satisfied with just keeping our one job.  We have one radio station.  We may have pushed off syndication for a little while now.  We were doing so well.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  How does it happen? 
[00:06:30]  How does this happen?  Every time.  We were so close.  We were good for a month.  We were good for a month, right?  Right?  Yeah.  Let's go to Jerry.  Jerry, you're next on NEW.  How are you?  Oh, great, guys.  Hey, listen.  Great show yesterday.  But I've got to tell you, I spent the whole day on the phone.  I was trying to rent a 14-inch U-Haul.  I figured I'd have to move to another city to keep hearing you guys.  14-inch U-Haul.  Hey, syndication now, guys.  Take care.  Good job.  Thank you.  Joe, what's up? 
[00:07:00]  Hey, is it true that Michael Marcus is starting to remake of the Lloyd Bridges show,  Sea Hunt?  Yeah, remember Sea Hunt?  Hey, you guys going to back him up?  No, we'll hang him out to dry in a second.  No.  Wait a minute, Opie.  I have to check the Geiger counter.  Yeah.  Wow, this area is very irradiated.  Oh, my God.  There's a lot of radiation in the area. 
[00:07:30]  Shrapnel all over the office.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  All over our asses.  Yeah.  Let's go to Sal on line one.  Sal, what's up?  Yes.  I was very injured by the radiation.  I want to sue you, precious Anthony.  I was down by the last night, and my eyes were blinded, and I couldn't see.  Not bad.  I'm going to sue you.  Sue Ed.  Slim Jim from Manhasset. 
[00:08:00]  Hey, ONA.  What are the odds of us ever hearing a replay of the A-bomb?  Well, zero.  You have a better chance of finding out about Ant's mom and a Met player.  Right?  It's a nice name category.  Let's just put it that way.  Yeah.  I'm reading some instant feedback.  You guys are brutal. 
[00:08:30]  Hi, Don and Mike.  You two sure sound a lot like Opie and Anthony.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wait, man.  Oh, Alan.  Alan on the message board's chiming in.  Okay.  What is he saying now?  That, yeah, so we didn't get suspended.  But, according to them themselves, they got quite the reprimand for the little incident yesterday with NBC. 
[00:09:00]  So the board isn't as far off as they like to pretend.  Now, what I'm saying is, yes, some people had it kind of right.  We were going to get reamed out for it.  But there are other people making it sound like, you know, people are talking.  They're reading memos.  And that's all bull crap, Alan.  That's what I was saying.  That's the bull part.  And it's the same frigging people.  The same people that cannot stand this program get on and start talking out of their butts. 
[00:09:30]  That's it.  You know, I don't even want to run down the list.  But you know who you are.  They've been on there plenty of times on how they can't stand this program.  And I see no fact in what they're posting up on there about reading memos from Wins.  Wins doesn't have anything to do with us.  Our GM doesn't even work up there anymore. 
[00:10:00]  Check it.  Boy, Alan, quick to post.  What's the matter?  In between races?  In between drilling?  Or is somebody still numbing up from the Novocaine?  What is it, Alan?  Bill, what's going on?  Guys.  Yeah, Bill.  You guys are frigging geniuses.  No, I wouldn't go that far, believe me.  No, I don't think it had anything to do with intelligence.  I still got radiation burns on my body from the damn nuclear fallout from yesterday.  Oh, my God.  I just want to thank everyone that sent an email. 
[00:10:30]  I've gone through over 1,000 already.  Yeah, it's been sick.  We only get about 200 a day from you guys.  We can't really answer you back anymore.  But overnight, we got over 1,000 emails.  Dude, I almost crashed my car, I swear to God, three times on the way home yesterday.  It was the funniest thing I ever heard in my life.  And then I saw the video on the website, and I swear to God, my monitor almost cracked.  Yeah, well, the interesting thing, everyone had about 40 minutes to find a TV.  So, I mean, there were so many freaking people that checked it out yesterday. 
[00:11:00]  I mean, just that little hand creeping up over the shoulder.  Oh, my God.  Guys, you rule.  I've been listening for a long time.  You guys are the funniest guys I've ever heard in my life.  Oh, look at that.  Thank you, bro.  And I was also at the sticker stop yesterday and donated to what's-her-name's cause.  Yeah, she's going to be all right.  Yeah?  I guess Trish had a little problem with the cops out there in Jersey yesterday.  It was the funniest thing.  You know what the funny part was?  The hillside cops were coming in to get stickers, and union cops were there to take her away. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  And hillside cops were coming in, yeah, we want stickers.  We don't care about the girl.  I guess she got on top of a 12-foot ladder.  Yeah, she got on top of a 12-foot ladder, and as I turned around, I got kind of a half-wowed,  and the cops decided, okay, that's enough.  And the booms were just, you could hear the booms for like a mile.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden, they pulled the cops out, and we're like, oh, come on.  And that was the end.  They put her in the car, and I don't know what happened after that.  And then all of a sudden, the cash started flowing.  Yeah.  The guys are throwing 20s, 10s, 50s.  Yeah, I'm happy to report she's going to be just fine. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, but anyway, you guys rule, and I just wanted to let you know.  Thanks a lot.  All right, man.  Bye.  That was very funny.  That was very funny.  Didn't we just talk to you for an hour?  No, no, I just wanted to tell you that, you know something?  Yeah.  I laughed my ass off yesterday.  Yeah, this is our boss from the center.  That was fun.  Now, here's another joke.  Here's one for you.  Maybe I can make you laugh.  Yeah.  You're fine.  How's that?  That's a good goddamn joke, isn't it?  That's a funny one. 
[00:12:30]  No, it wasn't, you know, goddamn.  Wasn't that, was it?  No.  No.  It wasn't a crack.  No.  No, no, no.  Wasn't a wow.  No.  Oh, how you boys love the wow, don't you?  Put wow on TV.  We've done that a lot, sure.  See you next Tuesday.  Yeah.  Un-eff-in-believable.  Now, look, you got me cursed.  And I don't say goddamn.  I've told you that.  You boys are stupid.  More tricks in the stupid column. 
[00:13:00]  And trying to find out who the hell Colonel Clibber's was.  Be fired.  I'm afraid I'll hire them just so I can fire them.  Fred Flintstone from Bedrock.  Syndication when the A-bomb gets rebroadcasted.  Keith wants to know if it's okay to come out of the fallout shelter, Anthony.  No, I would stay in there for just a little longer, believe me.  I know we'll be in the fallout shelter for a little longer.  For quite a long time.  Do you know that they're selling the tape on eBay already? 
[00:13:30]  Oh, no.  What?  You guys are going to get a skirt.  I'm telling you, man.  I'm serious.  Really?  Check it out for yourself unless it's down now.  Charlie, what's going on?  Yeah, you guys get on first thing.  Can you explain a little bit of what's going on?  Because I wasn't listening when it went down.  Were you listening yesterday at all?  Yeah, and early on, you know, from three to four maybe.  All right.  Just think of the sickest word you can imagine. 
[00:14:00]  And just imagine it being on live TV.  The sickest word.  All right.  About it.  Oh, okay.  What channel would you get it on, though?  On a big sign.  On what?  On what?  The news?  While they're trying to do a live news story, yes.  Oh.  Beautiful.  Beautiful.  Thank you.  Okay, terrific.  Yeah.  Okay, horrific.  I got another joke for you.  Southern guy, yeah. 
[00:14:30]  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  No one.  You're fired.  You get it?  See, if you're facing knock, knock,  or if you're supposed to answer,  you're not there.  Uh, Berga, from New Rochelle.  I got out of work Wednesday in Midtown around six,  and I saw a little Vietnamese girl running naked,  crying with her skin hanging off.  What happened?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, no.  All right.  Syndication when we colonize Mars.  Great.  They're selling the tape of the A-bomb on eBay for $10.50. 
[00:15:00]  Quantity, one.  Time left, six days and three hours.  Oh.  Someone just sent me some still pictures of it.  It's just really bad.  It's popping up now. 
[00:15:30]  Oh.  Wait, turn around, turn around.  Oh, man.  It's just not right.  It's really bad.  Uh, Sub, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  It's all over the internet already.  That was so funny yesterday.  I laugh, I laugh so hard,  but the question I have for you guys now is,  you sound a little scared.  Oh, yeah?  And I'm wondering if you guys are, like,  not going to go the next level.  What could possibly be the next level? 
[00:16:00]  I don't know, but there's always more to explore.  That's what I mean.  You could always explore,  and I'm wondering if you guys are going to be a little scared now.  Uh-huh.  If you possibly have your jobs on the line.  When you do, when you do gonzo radio,  gonzo, radio in the gonzo style.  I'm just going to put it all out on the line  and see what happens.  That's just horrible.  Well, you have to.  I mean, you have to go that next step,  or else people are going to get poor.  Yeah.  Well, we'll figure something out.  Right on, man. 
[00:16:30]  Great show.  Thank you, Sub.  Aw.  It's all over the internet.  I'm looking at the pictures.  It's just horrendous.  Yeah, look at how this thing.  Look how this red arrow light  up in the back is just pointing at you.  Oh, that's it.  Oh, I thought someone just put that in there.  Oh, my God.  That's so cool.  Part of the background scenery.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Tim, what's going on? 
[00:17:00]  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Are you guys planning on getting fired  the day before the two-year anniversary,  which is today?  Was that, like, planned?  No, it was not planned.  Well, it was the anniversary of New York.  We got fired in Boston  on our three-year anniversary, didn't we?  Yeah, we did.  Yeah, New York on the two-year?  That'd be great.  By the way, we did sign a contract  two years ago today.  Yeah.  Congratulations.  Two years ago today,  all the critics in New York said  we wouldn't last six months.  Two years later.  Now we're up to two years. 
[00:17:30]  Now they're saying,  well, now they won't make it  until September.  New York up in ours  because of you guys.  Well, you know what we're going to do?  Because I guess we started  broadcasting an afternoon drive.  Like, June 26th, I'm here.  I think right around that day  we're going to have to go somewhere  and buy beers for everyone.  Yeah, definitely.  So, you know,  another little out and about  after the show  in some local bar.  So keep your calendar free.  End of the month,  we'll do something cool  if we're still around.  All right, well,  as I said on your birthday,  syndication when your wife is born. 
[00:18:00]  F you, Jennifer.  Bye.  Wow.  All right.  Well, we're going to get  into some other things today,  right, Anthony?  Yeah.  Josh, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Yo, okay,  I just spoke to my girlfriend  and she was like  10 minutes late  for her job kind of thing.  So the district manager  is there, right?  And the guy goes,  why were you late?  She said,  well, I had some car problems  this morning,  you know, real life stuff.  And the guy goes,  well, such and such company,  real life doesn't happen. 
[00:18:30]  And she goes,  okay, terrific,  really loud  and just like walks right past it.  Like, she lives upstate,  so she listens to you guys with me.  And like,  I've been saying,  okay, terrific,  and she like hates you guys.  And it's really funny  that she's going around  saying that now.  So she got fired  and she said,  okay, terrific.  Exactly.  Thank you.  Hey, syndication with boobies, right?  All right, man.  Peace.  Bye.  Well, Opie,  obviously a lot of people  speculating as to what the,  after the A-bomb is dropped,  what possibly the hydrogen bomb,  the H-bomb could be. 
[00:19:00]  I don't think we'll be finding that out  for quite some time.  Oh, no.  You must assess the damage.  We have to do a damage assessment,  see if there was any collateral damage,  they call it.  You know?  And then,  then we'll start pondering  what possibly the H-bomb could be.  I don't even know what that could be.  After this one,  everyone's on pins and needles  associated with this radio show right now.  Very scared.  Well, Anthony,  how about those Knicks?  Well,  I don't know much about basketball, 
[00:19:30]  as you know,  Opie,  but even I know.  They,  they had a good lead.  They blew it  and lost the game  and Ewing was indeed  in the lineup.  The entire game,  more or less.  It was so funny,  I was reading the email  before the show.  A bunch of idiots out there.  When the Knicks are up by 18,  everyone's emailing me like crazy.  Hey,  Opie,  Ewing's in the lineup  and they're up by 18.  What do you have to say  about this now?  They'll say people didn't,  you know,  right back after they lost. 
[00:20:00]  Did you happen to watch the,  uh,  did you watch,  uh,  the cartoon Clerks  last night?  Was it good?  It was pretty fun.  I liked it,  but one thing,  the jury,  they had like a trial going on,  like a people's court thing.  The jury was like the Knicks  and,  uh,  they had a dream sequence  and Patrick Ewing was,  he was dreaming that he actually  made a jump shot  and won like  a championship  and then they have him  wake up and he didn't pay it. 
[00:20:30]  That's pretty funny.  That's someone with  a sense of humor.  Yeah.  That's funny.  So,  yeah,  that was,  that was a tough loss yesterday,  obviously.  I don't think we need  to spend 12,  15 hours on it.  Well,  I think you're wrong,  I think we need to spend  about the next five hours.  Those guys are,  uh,  about to commit suicide  over there.  Yeah.  Over the Nick,  uh,  loss.  Sure.  How do they do it to the  80 bucks?  Can we have a spaz  van damage update? 
[00:21:00]  Yes.  Yes,  we will get into that.  I went downstairs  to the garage last night  to get my vehicle  and,  uh,  walked over to the van  just so I could take a look.  He's out of his effing mind  when he says,  oh,  there is nothing.  All right,  this is what we'll do.  It's nothing,  baby.  This is what we'll do.  Baby.  This is what we'll do.  Because we need,  uh,  we need people to check out  the pictures for themselves.  Yeah.  We're going to take a quick break.  Uh,  we'll talk about the A-bomb  all day long,  by the way,  so.  Yeah,  don't worry about that.  Don't worry about that.  Uh,  we're just getting warmed up here. 
[00:21:30]  All right.  The damage to the wow van  can be seen  at www.com.  Oh,  it can.  Yeah,  Rick and Ben snuck down  to the garage.  They took a couple pictures.  It is now up on www.com.  I guess you've got to go  to the Opie and Anthony section.  All right,  we're going to take a quick break  so you guys can check out  the pictures  and then give us a call  and you tell us  what you think of the damage.  Spaz basically saying  it's just a scratch  and then he wants to bring  his own paint in  and paint the bag.  Paint?  Yes,  and we'll talk to Spaz next 
[00:22:00]  as well.  212-757-1027.  Play it.  Help your luck.  Play it.  Help your luck.  Play it.  Help your luck.  Opie and Anthony.  More stupidity is on the way.  102-7-W-N-E-W-E.

If you weren't listening  to the whole show yesterday,  Spaz went to the  WOW sticker stop.  Oh, I should announce  today's WOW sticker stop  real fast.  We're going to be giving out  the WOW stickers  at Strauss Discount Auto, 
[00:24:30]  345 Connor Street  in the Bronx.  We'll be there  in an hour  with Black Earl.  Another mess  to be had today  for sure.  So if you want to get  your WOW stickers  then you're in the Bronx.  Strauss Discount Auto  within the hour,  345 Connor Street  in the Bronx.  Jeff Norris going,  Gorilla Boy will be there too.  Cool, he does a great job.  All right,  so yesterday  we sent Spaz  to the WOW sticker stop,  Anthony.  Yeah.  And, well, 
[00:25:00]  he crashed the van  in front of,  I don't know,  three, four,  maybe 500 listeners.  Yeah, he hit a cement  pillar  that was in front  of the place.  He's trying to back up  onto a sidewalk  or something.  What a tool.  He, like,  was trying to get  over the curb  so it's like...  Didn't he go up  a handicap ramp  and it wasn't,  it wasn't wide enough  so the wheel went boom.  Only one of his wheels  were able to fit  on the handicap ramp.  The other one  was on the curb.  So he had to,  he had to gas it. 
[00:25:30]  But as he's gassing it,  he's like,  got the wheels cut.  So when it finally  pops over the curb,  it goes off  to the right  and smacks  into the,  the cement pole.  Yeah.  So we went down  into the garage  and we finally got  pictures of the damage.  I'm looking over here.  And you can check him out  at www.com.  Just go to  Opie and Anthony.  And your comments  right off the bat.  When he says  it was nothing,  no,  this isn't nothing. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah,  it's not total.  I mean,  obviously,  but this is something  that you would really  be upset about  if it was your car  and it didn't have,  it wasn't beat off,  it had just been painted  and you come home  and see this on it,  you would freak  the F out.  Oh yeah,  look at the mirror.  All I know,  when I got,  remember when I got  my Cougar  like,  I don't know,  three or four years ago?  Sure.  And I had just gotten it.  It was brand new.  First new car  I ever owned  in my life.  So psyched to have it. 
[00:26:30]  It was black,  beautiful.  I park it  at a rest stop  to run in  and take a leak  and get a soda.  I come out,  someone had opened  their door  and put a ding  right in the door.  I swear,  if I would have  known who that was,  I would have killed  the person.  For a ding in the door,  I would have killed  the person.  Now,  a vest moment  with a spaz  doing this  to the van,  which had just  been painted,  doesn't have body damage,  and he says  it's nothing.  Now,  if a ding  on the door  set me off, 
[00:27:00]  imagine if I saw  this kind of damage  on my vehicle.  Yeah.  I'm just trying  to show you  how,  like,  really bad  this is.  We have Mike  from the garage  in the studio.  He's a good friend  of ours.  Yeah.  I see him every day.  And Mike  was telling  everyone around  here that spaz  is a complete  fool.  Yeah,  man,  he's crazy.  He's so crazy.  He can't drive.  No,  because when he  came to pick  up the vehicle,  he's holding  his head down.  Yeah.  I was saying,  man,  this guy  is a sick guy.  His head's all down.  I was going to  hide some  for his driver's license. 
[00:27:30]  That's real,  man.  Yeah,  because he looks  so nervous,  you know.  You see all the guys  go down  into the garage  to get the van  and stuff.  Earl,  Earl,  and Ben,  and Ben,  and Cycle Mark,  they're all  relatively normal,  right?  You never thought  this guy was  holding his head down.  I was like,  man,  I'm not going to  give a vehicle  to this guy.  I can't believe it.  Ah,  here he is.  All right,  spaz.  Hey,  spaz.  Spaz, 
[00:28:00]  you are out  of your mind.  I got to say it.  Did you see  the damage  to the van?  What?  And you say  it's nothing.  It's a paycheck.  It is,  okay,  okay.  First,  now,  before you say  anything,  we have pictures.  Come here.  Look at this picture.  Do you see  that this is  actually dented?  That's dented?  I went down,  I went down  last night  and looked at this van.  What,  are you going to go  to the hobby store  and get some matte black  that you paint 
[00:28:30]  your Estes model rockets  with and just go over it?  How are you going  to paint that?  A paintbrush.  Look,  it's dented right here,  right by where  the seam of the door  meets,  and on the other side  and over here.  I went down and looked  and you tried slapping  a sticker over it  last night.  I went downstairs  to look at it  and I'm like,  where's the sky?  Oh,  look,  look,  you put a sticker  over it.  Good as new.  Now,  let's back up.  What happened yesterday?  Well,  I got there fine.  I drove the van  perfect there. 
[00:29:00]  Perfect.  No,  you guys didn't even  see me driving,  so how can you  make any comments  on it?  Because I've heard.  Yesterday,  you were not with me  in the van,  so you can't make  any comments.  I drove perfect there  and then I get there  and Big Kev says,  you know what,  I think it would be  better if you're  parked up on the curb  in front of GameStop.  So,  he started directing  me on the curb  and I just didn't  cut the wheel right.  Didn't cut the wheel right.  You're backing up  the curb.  No,  I didn't back up,  I was going forward. 
[00:29:30]  You were going forward  and you hit this?  Yeah.  Did you see it  right next to you?  It was on my blind side.  Blind side?  It hit the mirror.  How is the mirror  your blind side?  I'm stunned by  it hit the mirror.  That's got to be  the part of the vehicle  that you see the most.  The mirror.  Other people  hit your mirror.  You don't hit  your own mirror.  It hit the back  of the mirror,  not the front of the mirror.  It doesn't matter.  It's a pole  in front of your truck. 
[00:30:00]  It went like this.  That's the front of the mirror.  No,  it hit the back  of the mirror  and pushed the mirror  to the rear.  How is that  your blind spot  if it hit the mirror?  Anything that hit  the mirror  would be in plain view  of you in the driver's seat.  I had my sunglasses on  and I wasn't looking.  Look,  I think he was  going forward.  I was going forward.  You were going forward.  So you had to have  somebody said  punch the gas  because I wasn't  making it over the curb  so I punched the gas.  Thank God  someone didn't say 
[00:30:30]  run over some pedestrians.  I heard somebody  say punch the gas.  I'm going to take  your job here.  You got to give me  your job.  Yeah,  you can take it.  No problem.  You have a lot  of experience  driving cars  in tight areas  around cement poles.  Have you ever  smacked into anything  down there?  No, no.  See,  look at it.  Imagine Spaz  working in the  parking garage  downstairs.  Oh,  people would be like,  what is this?  I didn't know  it was my blind spot.  I came out of the corner.  I was talking.  I'm sorry,  baby.  So,  Spaz wants to 
[00:31:00]  Spaz wants to  bring in paint  and paint  the damage.  I'd paint it  and it'd be good  as new.  It would not.  What about some dents?  There is no dents.  It's dented.  I saw it last night.  How do you know  they weren't there  before I got the van?  Oh,  and cleverly  right under  where the new  abrasions are.  All right,  if you're going  to play that game,  hold on,  hold on.  Rod,  Rod,  Rod,  what's up?  Hey,  what's up,  guys?  You got a,  you got a tape  of the crap?  Yeah,  me and my brother  were there.  We had a cabcorder. 
[00:31:30]  And we nailed  the tape in today.  You saw the whole crash?  No,  we saw it from  when he pulled up  onto the sidewalk.  Now,  number one,  he pulled up  onto the sidewalk  on a strip ball.  I mean,  I don't even know  how he fits a van.  There's about  three feet of roof  and he finds  a giant van  onto the sidewalk.  Big Kev told me  that it's got to be  in front of GameStop.  So I did what he said.  Literally,  he was almost  through the window.  He was almost  through the window.  You're like,  you're like 
[00:32:00]  one of those  old ladies  dropping down.  I was hilarious.  Anyway,  we had the camera  out and he's like  bent over  and it's like  his butt  in the camera's face  and he's looking  at the thing  like,  wow,  what do I do?  And I've been  listening to the show  and I always thought  it was like  partially in the act  and I'm like,  no,  it's real.  It's real.  It's fast.  And you can hear me  laughing in the background  and it's so great.  I can't wait  to see the video  you guys.  Can I ask you something?  It's fast as a little scratch  and he tries to open 
[00:32:30]  the door  and a piece of mold  he falls off.  Right,  right.  Thank you.  Bye.  I can't wait  to see that day.  I've got to ask  Spaz something.  If you could come  back here to Exhibit A,  the photographs  on the NEW website.  See,  right here and here,  I see.  Now,  this is the plastic  door molding  that keeps doors  from dinging you  in the parking lot.  A lot of the SUVs  and vans  have them now.  See that?  That can't be painted.  But I want to know  how if you hit  the mirror,  the door,  and this,  right in this area,  how did the 
[00:33:00]  running board  back here  get damaged?  That's almost impossible.  Can you roll  over a click?  And over here,  the part of the door,  they didn't get that either.  There's more damage  over here.  How did,  if it happened  right here,  how did it get  damaged back here?  Well,  as soon as I  felt a bump,  I just cut the wheel  the other way  and it moved forward  just a little bit more.  So you felt the bump,  you cut the wheel  so it wouldn't hit  where it had already  just hit,  and then you 
[00:33:30]  kept going forward  and it hit  further back?  Oh my God.  Hold on,  Scott Cuomo's  in the studio,  he does all the fine  internet stuff for us  for the NAW website.  You saw Spaz  leave the garage  yesterday?  Yeah,  I saw Spaz  leave the garage  yesterday,  he was flying  out of the garage  and just almost  slammed into  the person  in front of him  when he realized  that people  were stopped  in front of him.  Whoa,  this is dangerous.  We ought to give  one of those  driving tests 
[00:34:00]  like they gave  Marsha Brady  and Greg Brady,  you know,  with the cones  and stuff.  It's not a bad idea.  You sound  like a really bad driver.  I'm a good driver.  I drive every  just car all the time.  Rain Man,  you are a bad driver.  How many days?  I'm a bad driver.  I'm a good driver.  Old style.  The gonzo style.  The gonzo style.  I drove with this idiot  out to the Coliseum  last month.  Yeah.  Massa Coliseum  from the WWF.  I swear to God,  we're on the expressway.  As Scott says,  even though people 
[00:34:30]  are slowing down  in front of us,  he will hit the gas  and come up  right up to their ass  and then slam  on the brakes.  Oh,  he's one of those guys.  You're sitting there  with your feet  on the floor.  Oh my God.  And then changing lanes.  Not only does he only  do 50 miles an hour,  but he changes lanes  like he's going  through the cones.  Oh my God.  And he's just like,  he's looking back  and all of a sudden  the jerk motion happens.  Oh,  yeah.  Spaz,  how bad is Erica's car dinged up? 
[00:35:00]  Not at all.  You have no strength.  It is not dinged up at all.  And I drove a U-Haul truck,  mind you.  Ooh.  Probably another U-Haul  out there  with the top ripped back.  All right,  Adam,  what's going on?  Hey,  what's up,  guys?  Hey.  Look at him.  He got the handle broken.  He got the mirror,  the gas.  How can he get the gas broken?  He wrecked everything.  The whole side of this van  is like scratched up.  It had a brand new paint job.  Look at the rest of that van.  It's beautiful.  You need it.  I'm blowing up the pictures. 
[00:35:30]  Look what he did.  You can see the lights  from the garage  shining  in that black paint  because it had just been painted.  I think it all  has to do with your commute, Spaz.  You're tired.  Maybe that's it.  Three and a half hours  to get to work.  Three and a half hours  he commutes  to get into work.  Can you believe that?  So who's going to pay  for this damage?  It's got to come out  of Spaz's pay.  I believe he's now  over the $50,000  in debt mark.  Dave,  what's going on?  I'm a good driver.  Dave's going to tell us  how much damage 
[00:36:00]  it's going to cost you.  All right, Dave.  What do you do  for a living?  Dave.  Hey, Dave.  Are you Dave?  Dave?  I hear something  in the background.  You, man.  You.  Go.  Hello?  Yeah, you.  Yes.  You're like 12.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Come on.  Let's go to Jim.  Jim's a body shop guy.  Hello?  You work at a body shop?  Yeah, I work at a body shop.  Believe it or not,  keep Spaz driving these vans.  We're slow right now.  I could use the business.  You know? 
[00:36:30]  Did you get to see the pictures?  No, I haven't seen  the pictures yet.  I got a...  We need a professional  to check out the pictures  and give us a call.  Give us a little estimate.  Give us an estimate.  I'll check them out  and I'll give you an estimate.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Have the bosses piped in yet  over this crap?  Not yet.  They probably will  when they see the pictures.  And Spaz,  why are you getting so pissed?  Yeah, you're very defensive  on this,  like it's nothing.  The pictures make it worse  than it really is.  No, the pictures  don't show really  how bad it is. 
[00:37:00]  The pictures don't do  this justice,  I got to say.  Don't you understand  this is not buried  in just painting?  That's a dent right there  next to the door.  It's dented.  But that was...  I didn't do that dent.  Yes, you did.  I just scraped the wall.  But scraping,  putting pressure on metal  will dent it.  That dent wasn't  undefined yesterday  when I gave it to him.  That's dented.  Yeah, Mike works  in the garage.  He knows the shape  of the van.  The mirror got it worse.  Yeah, well,  the mirror got it worse.  Yeah, sure.  But the side's dented.  And then look at  the running board.  How are you going  to fix that? 
[00:37:30]  It's gouged.  There is material  removed from it.  They're going to have  to get a whole...  There's no painting it.  Yeah, they're going to  have to get a whole  new piece for that.  We could just cover it  with a...  No, man.  It's our show.  We want a nice-looking van  right there.  And look,  there's a piece of a sticker  over there  that they tried to cover up  the running board.  Big Kev, who was there.  Big Kev,  did you see the crash yesterday?  Yes, I did.  Kevin,  Spaz is almost  blaming this on you.  I know.  That's why I had to call in  because I can't take 
[00:38:00]  the blame for this one.  I'd like to back up  a few paces  if you wouldn't mind.  When Spaz arrived,  there were no parking  spaces at the strip mall.  And so what I said was,  last week when Jeff Norris  and I were doing  the sticker stop,  we put the truck  right on the extra-wide sidewalk  in front of the store  next to the sticker stop,  which is unoccupied  at this time. 
[00:38:30]  And then I said,  now listen to me  and follow what I'm saying  and everything  will be fine.  Yeah, I know.  Get to the facts.  Let me,  all right,  well,  here's a couple of facts  that you might have missed.  One,  someone did not yell out,  hit the gas.  Someone yelled out,  punch it,  chewy.  Punch it,  chewy.  And that's when Spaz,  perhaps one might say, 
[00:39:00]  over-enthusiastically  hit the gas,  which launched the car  into the truck,  the van,  into the pillar.  That was the first hit.  Yeah,  now we have to get Spaz  off of the pillar.  So I say to Spaz,  put it in reverse.  Right.  Just puts it in reverse  and cuts the wheel  the wrong way  towards the pillar.  Right.  And that's when  perhaps a little  other scraping damage  might have occurred. 
[00:39:30]  Yes,  we've got  a new belief.  That's not an experienced driver.  No,  you're right.  See?  Oh,  yeah,  like it happens every day  you go in between  two pillars  over three feet apart.  Well,  then,  you know something?  If you are doing it  and it doesn't happen every day,  wouldn't you be so extra careful  that nothing would happen?  Or you wouldn't try it.  You'd just say,  you know what,  I can't do that.  I'm just parking it right here.  What did it matter?  You didn't need to be  right in front of the place.  The whole parking lot  was packed with our listeners.  I got it here  from a body shop guy  because I swear 
[00:40:00]  this,  the running board  would have to be replaced  to get this thing  in the condition  that it was  before this happened.  The running board  has to be replaced.  There's no way  to remold  a piece of the running board.  It's like a plastic thing  and there's a gouge  taken out of it.  The side view mirror  would have to be replaced.  Side view mirror,  replaced.  That dent  would have to be taken out  and three panels  would have to be painted.  Right.  It's got to be  at least two grand. 
[00:40:30]  And you don't just paint  the damaged area  after you get the dent out.  You have to paint  an entire area  around it  to blend it in properly.  What about the dent  on the driver's side?  That wasn't my fault.  There's a dent there.  How come nobody  got in trouble  about that one?  Where's the dent  on the driver's side?  Nobody took a picture  of that one?  There's a dent  on the driver's side.  When did you do that?  I didn't do that.  That was there  when I got it.  You're going to have  to take the blame  for all the dents.  Lewis.  Oh, God.  I can't believe  this dumb douchebag. 
[00:41:00]  Hey, hey, hey.  Spazzy Wonder.  Did you have  your dark glasses on,  Spazzy Wonder,  when you were driving  the vehicle?  Did you have you  seeing a dog  running in front of the vehicle  telling you  where to drive?  What the hell's wrong  with you?  He was wearing dark glasses.  Oh, paper.  Oh, paper.  Is that a handicapped lady  standing there?  I don't know  that I'll back off.  Hey, God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, what about  the dent on the other side  where I slammed my head  after I realized  what I did? 
[00:41:30]  Oh, my God.  Guys, you're killing me.  This can't be real.  There's nobody  this funny in real life.  Lewis, the funny thing is  we all had a huge meeting  before we decided  to let Spaz  go to the Wow Sticker Stop.  Uh-huh.  Huge meeting.  Like, you think  you'll be okay.  You think you'll get there.  You think you'll...  And at what point  did you smoke enough  reefer to say  Yeah, that would be  a good idea.  Yeah, I swear.  The guy who got  people pissed on his head,  yeah, let him drive  the vehicle.  It's just like  the Brady Bunch episode  where Greg was going 
[00:42:00]  to work for his father  taking the blueprint.  Stevie Wonder  could drive better  than he does.  And he screwed it up.  Maybe you should have  Stevie Wonder  do the next Thicker Stop.  Hey, man,  look how you drive  the vehicles, man.  Oh, Stevie,  how do you do it?  Never watch it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What happened there  has nothing to do  with driving.  I got there fine.  I got there 4.30 exactly,  which is more  than Earl can do.  And second of all,  nobody...  Everyone gets to the point 
[00:42:30]  where they had the accident.  Right.  Everyone gets there.  It's not like,  whoa, thank God  I didn't get to the accident.  Right.  I got there, yeah.  You got there  to the accident.  But what happened  is not a normal driving thing.  People don't normally  drive through  two pillars every day.  Yeah, I know.  Only, Dad.  I was calling  somebody's advice.  Hey, Spaz, Spaz,  pay attention, Spaz.  Every night,  I park my car  in a garage  in my building. 
[00:43:00]  There is about  a foot of space  combined  between both sides  of my car,  which means  with the mirrors,  there's maybe  three, four inches  on each side.  Spaz,  I've been driving  for 15 years.  If you blindfolded me  and suck a pipe  off my ass,  I can park a vehicle  better than you do,  you dumb dickweed.  Figure out how  to park a vehicle,  dickweed.  Oh, you think  all my hair  was all poofy,  I wish to jump in. 
[00:43:30]  God damn, Lou.  Guys, you're killing me.  You're killing me, man.  Nothing could be  this funny  in real life.  Hey, hey, Spaz,  maybe you should  have put Spaz  at the site  of the explosion  yesterday.  Then his poofy hair  could have absorbed  the radiation.  Oh, my favorite  baby,  baby, my hair  was poofy.  I couldn't drive.  I'm sorry.  Now I know why,  by the way,  now I know why  that dickweed  takes the train  every day.  Baby won't trust  him with the train.  Baby, that's why. 
[00:44:00]  Handicapped people  three feet tall  could drive down  and use a dickweed.  All right, Louis.  Oh, God.  Thank you.  Thank you, man.  Let me shoot him now  so he won't procreate  and there won't be  little Spazies  running around.  No, it sucks.  Louis is hilarious,  but Spaz refuses  to put him through  on the show.  I know.  Because he calls  every day to abuse Spaz.  Oh, yeah.  And Spaz hangs up on him.  The only time we get  him on the air  is when Spaz is in here  and someone else  is screening the call.  Bob from Jersey, Anthony.  Yeah.  Let me get this straight. 
[00:44:30]  You let the guy  you call Spaz  who believes in  cancerous live wires,  giant mosquitoes,  as well as the famous  Cancer World Series  conspiracy theory,  drive the van  and you're surprised  at what happened.  Hey, O&A,  just saw the damage  to the van.  I work for a dealership  that has a body shop.  Guess what?  That running board alone,  he looked it up,  will cost you  at least three grand  to replace.  It's a piece of plastic.  Yeah, well,  so?  It's got to be sexually made.  That running board 
[00:45:00]  runs the entire length  between the wheels  and it's got,  it's sectioned off  like an end section,  middle, front.  And to replace it,  three grand.  That costs a lot  of money, guys.  Yeah.  This guy,  Anthony.  Yes.  You took pictures  of the van  at the sticker stock?  Yes, I was there.  I spoke to Kevin.  I walked up  and he saw my shirt.  I'm a damage appraiser  for an insurance company.  Oh.  All right.  So give us the estimate.  Well, I'm faxing it  to you right now  as we speak.  I wrote it up.  Go get it.  Go get it. 
[00:45:30]  Okay, let me see.  I'm putting it  through right now.  And, yeah,  he pulled me aside.  He said,  you're an appraiser?  And I actually  took a couple of pictures  and, hey, listen,  that wow really works.  I mean,  until the cops showed up.  Yeah, yeah.  It was pretty cool.  I'm sending it over  right now.  Do you have  a fax machine there?  Hold on the line.  We'll take a break  and we'll get your estimate  on the radio next.  How's that?  Hold on.  Sounds good.  Opie,  one of the TWA  Flight 800 investigators  checking in  wants to know 
[00:46:00]  if Spaz can come down  with some red and white paint  to fix the crash damage.  Oh, brother.  What's going to happen today?  We're doing another  wow sticker stop  at Stroud Discount Auto,  345 Conner Street  in the Bronx.  Did Earl leave already?  He's supposed to be there  at 430.  Did Earl leave?  You would think  he would be smart  enough to leave already,  right?  Earl will be there  at 430.  Oh, my God.  Jeff Norris  giving out the wow stickers  in the Bronx.  345 Conner Street. 
[00:46:30]  Wow, going to the Bronx.  Stroud Discount Auto.  All right, Ed.  Want to take a quick break?  Yeah, then we'll get the estimate  and see what the deal is.  And we'll move on.  See you then.  Hi, this is Louis Black  from The Daily Show.  And you're listening to two  of the most psychotic  human beings I've ever met.  My pals,  Opie and Anthony  on 102.7 WNEW.

[00:47:30]  You ladies.  Man, you're killing me.  Yeah.  Just everywhere you look.  Well, and there are some women  that I can't do that.  I must say,  I don't see many fatties  around the station.  Maybe stacker 2.  I don't see any fatties.  I don't see any flat soes.  No spandex?  No.  None of the spandex pants  where they have the dual butt?  No.  If you have the butt  within a butt,  like a conjoined twin butt  growing out of it,  like you get the spandex pants  and there's a big fat ass  and right where ground zero  of the ass would be, 
[00:48:00]  there's another small mini butt.  Mini butt.  Mini butt.  It looks like it's  growing right out of the butt.  Let's not forget  back boobs, Anthony.  Back boobs.  If you got the back  back boobs working,  those are the big fat girls  that wear the,  like,  halter tops and stuff.  You just see back boob  hanging out.  And to the wise ass  that works at Hooters,  some chick,  no,  I will not be applying  her job at Hooters.  Thank you very much.  Making fun of the man boobs 
[00:48:30]  that you can see  in the Raw magazine.  I saw that issue  of Raw magazine finally  last night  with our pictures in there.  Boy,  you would have done  a grave disservice  with the lighting  or something.  Something, man.  Really look bad.  I'll take my licks.  I don't know  what the hell  is going on there,  but people abuse me bad.  A girl that works  at Hooters,  she wants to send me  an application.  Jackass.

Home by  Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027  WNEW.  New New New York.  All right.  That's not funny.  Hey, what?  You didn't hear that?  Oh, yeah, yeah,  that one.  Wait, I got to hear  this again. 
[00:49:30]  I thought  N-E-W was  powered by  Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Listen to what  they put together.  Powered by  Insert new show here.  By Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027  WNEW  New New York.  Easy.  Wow.  Easy.  Anyway, Anthony,  you're listening to the  most interactive radio  show in America.  Yeah, a lot of people 
[00:50:00]  going over the pictures  of the  WNEW  WOW  Opie and Anthony  WOW van  that was damaged  at the WOW sticker  stop yesterday.  Very damaged.  Yeah, damaged  by Spaz  as he tried  to circumnavigate  the parking lot  of a sticker  stop yesterday.  Huge parking lot,  one pole,  Spaz found the pole.  Yeah,  hit a big cement  pillar.  It just scraped  the hell out of it  and dented it  and ruined  the running board. 
[00:50:30]  And then he backs  up and does more  damage.  Does more damage.  He's trying to get  away from the pole.  This guy...  Yeah, let's go  to Anthony back  on the line.  Yeah.  Anthony's faxed  in an estimate.  Anthony, what do  you do for a living  again?  I'm a damage  appraiser for an  insurance company.  And you just  happened to be  at the WOW sticker  stop.  You took some  pictures and you  estimated the  damage, right?  Well, I heard  about it and I  said, I got to  see this.  So I ran up and  they pulled...  Actually, they  pulled me in  because they saw  my shirt and it  said damage  appraiser on it.  So I kind of got  right up to the 
[00:51:00]  front, got my  stickers and they  said, well, what  do you think?  And Spaz was putting  stickers over it.  But did you get  my estimate?  Yeah.  Now, on the  bottom it says  add-in replacement  running board.  Yeah, that's a  two-piece running  board.  There's a small  section in the  front and then the  longer section goes  across the whole  length of the  vehicle.  That's why it's  only $152.  So it's a two-piece  running board.  But you are right.  They can't be 
[00:51:30]  repaired.  They have to be  replaced.  Okay.  So the total  damage done to the  van?  Net total.  What is it?  $1,057.57.  There you go, Spaz.  And you think  if you just get  some paint and  everything will be  okay?  $40 paint.  You're going to  paint it yourself?  That's punishment.  Spaz, you can't  just paint it.  It's not a  wicked fence.  Let's ask him.  How do you  paint a car?  That's the whole  procedure to 
[00:52:00]  painting the van.  Yeah, it has to  be repaired properly  or else it'll  look terrible.  Yeah.  How do you do it?  How do you do it?  How do you do it?  Give me the  entire van.  What would you do?  From start to finish.  Okay.  Well, you see,  because you have  the letters,  you know,  wow paint down  and things.  So what you would  do is you put a  piece of tape  so you have  your line  so you don't  paint over the,  you know,  so you have...  All right.  That's the first  thing you would  do.  No, I'm talking  about you,  you walk up  to the van.  Yeah.  What do you  have with you?  I have my  paintbrush. 
[00:52:30]  Paintbrush?  Oh, be a paintbrush.  Okay.  You have a paintbrush  and what else?  A paint.  Okay.  Where are you  getting the paint?  Probably like a  local hardware store.  A local hardware  store.  Okay.  And you have  the paint,  the paintbrush  and what else?  And a roll of tape.  A roll of tape.  Yeah.  Now, what's the  first thing you do?  I lay down the  tape so I have  everything lined up.  You lay down the  tape to what?  To make sure that 
[00:53:00]  there's a straight  line still.  Huckleberry spaz.  A straight line  for what?  A straight...  So like,  you know how like  you make a block  letters so I don't  go over the letters.  You know,  just lay...  Wait,  screw all that.  Okay.  I can't get past  the...  You honestly think  you can just  paint it with a  paintbrush?  A paintbrush?  It can't be that  stupid.  Do you think  that's what they  do at the body  shops?  You said that  it was just  painted.  You better add  another 500 to  undo everything  he's going to do. 
[00:53:30]  We love it when  people try to  fix them themselves  first.  De-staz it.  Oh, man.  Don't paint  cars with a  paintbrush.  With a paintbrush.  So the first  thing you do is  start taping over  what?  The dirt and  the abrasive that  is still on the  dent.  That's what you  do?  No, no.  I tape over...  How are you  going to get the  dent out before  you paint it  with the paintbrush?  Well, if there  is a dent, you  can just take a  little hammer and  bang it on the  other side.  What?  How are you  going to get to  the other side  of that? 
[00:54:00]  What a  few goes  body shot.  I know.  And there's  people in their  cars like this  can't be real.  Trust me.  It's as real as it  gets.  It's as real as  it gets.  500 people saw  for themselves  yesterday.  Oh, my God.  Leonardo da  Vinci checking  in.  I wish I was  still alive to  get some painting  pointing from  Spaz.  Spaz is going  to be like,  all right, it's  our van.  We can do  whatever we want  with it.  Let's get a  little blizzard 
[00:54:30]  crimson right  here.  We're going to  put a happy  little tree over  this big dent.  There we go.  Maybe a little  waterfall.  All right, so  Anthony, you're  saying $1,056  to get the van  fixed.  Yes, at least.  And then you  have to send it  out to be  re-striped and  lettered with all  your logos on  it.  I don't know  how much that's  going to cost.  So you could  probably add  another $200 to  $300 on that  once you sublet  out the striping.  Someone  recommending Spaz  maybe crayons.  You could just  get a box of 
[00:55:00]  Crayola with a  black crayon.  Oh, man.  Well, at least  Earl never wrecked  the van.  I know.  Earl's going to be  at the Wow  Sticker stop today.  Is he driving the  beat-up van there?  So everyone gets  to see the van  there.  You can see the  famous van because  now it's famous  because it's on the  internet all cracked  up.  Strauss Discount Auto  at 430, 345  Connor Street in the  Bronx.  Giving out Wow  stickers today with  Jeff Norris,  Gorilla Boy.  Anthony, I guess  we're going to let  you go for now.  Okay, thanks.  It feels good to  contribute.  Well, thank you. 
[00:55:30]  Syndication when  Opie bangs Patty.  Thanks, guys.  If that's what it  takes, I think we're  going to be a one  station show.  All right, man.  Later on, man.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, my God.  So you get a paint  brush and you start  slopping paint on it.  Yeah, of course,  but staying in the  line.  Ah, well, staying in  the line, Opie.  Yes, of course.  With black paint that  you just pick up at a  hardware store.  Do you know how many  different types of  black there are for  cars? 
[00:56:00]  What if the blacks  don't match up?  And you know  something?  You're not going to  find an automotive  black paint at a  hardware store and it  cannot be applied with  a paint brush and it  has to be.  But a spray gun.  Oh, a spray gun.  You're on to  something there.  Terry, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  I blew up the picture  on the net.  I made it into a BMP  and take a look at a  section underneath the  wheel well.  Damage goes below the  skin there.  That's all the way into  the wheel well.  You're looking at a  lot more damage than  that. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, yeah.  Take a look at it.  If you manipulate a  little bit and blow that  section up, that whole  area there is buckled  into it.  So that whole fender  piece has to be  replaced, not just the  skin.  You can see kind of  where the door meets  the front fender, right?  In there.  Why do you guys keep  this idiot?  I don't know.  First he sploge is on  your couch.  Now he ruins your van.  Shoot him.  It is truly, truly  amazing.  Mac from Jersey, can of  paint, $25.  Take care, guys.  All right.  Mac from Jersey, can of 
[00:57:00]  paint, $25.  Roll of tape, $5.  Paintbrush, $3.  Listening to Spaz  explain, priceless.  The next time you let  Spaz drive the van,  make sure to install a  second brake on the  passenger side like a  driver's ed vehicle and  slap a big yellow student  driver's sign on the  back.  You're so stupid.  Oh, boy.  Why don't we get Spaz  together, can of paint,  and try to fix the  damage, Anthony?  Oh, that would be  really funny.  What do you think? 
[00:57:30]  Why haven't we heard  from the bosses?  Yeah.  Will Pip talk to us  about this?  I'd really like to  know.  I am so amazed that you  think you could just  paint it with a paint  brush, and then that  would be the first thing  you would do.  You wouldn't clean the  area off?  What is there to clean?  Look at it.  What is there to clean?  When you paint something,  it has to be totally  spotless clean.  You go over it with a  certain type of alcohol  to get any road grime 
[00:58:00]  and oil off of it, or  else the paint just  chips away.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I'm a cop out here on  the island.  Spaz has 10 days to  report this action to  motor vehicle.  Is that true?  Yeah, if the damage is  over a thousand bucks,  you've got to do that.  Your insurance is going  up, pal.  My insurance?  Yeah.  Car insurance?  Yeah.  I don't have car insurance.  You're an idiot. 
[00:58:30]  You don't have car insurance?  I'm not insured.  I just have a driver's  license.  I don't have a car.  I use my girlfriend's.  Well, you've got to be  insured to drive that  vehicle.  Just because she's  insured and you're  driving her car doesn't  mean you're covered.  No, it's under his  insurance.  Under her insurance.  No, it's going to be  under the station's  insurance.  Yeah, the station's  insurance will go up.  We know that, but I'm  curious.  When he drives  baby's car, it's under  her insurance.  Right.  So if he screws up,  her insurance goes up.  But under the  high-level car.  Of course not.  All right, Anthony. 
[00:59:00]  Dave, the blind guy  that caught the eggs  from Ivory's You-Know-What  about a year ago.  Dave, the blind guy,  how are you?  How's it going, Ed?  Now, I mean, you're  about, what, 70% to 80%  blind?  I'm like three times  past legally blind.  Three times past  legally blind.  And I was riding a dirt  bike this weekend.  Did you hit anything?  On a dirt road, 250  enduro.  Didn't hit anything.  All right.  Blind guy.  And what do you  suggest here, Dave,  the blind guy? 
[00:59:30]  You remember the  Brady Bunch where  Greg and Marcia had  that parking lot  challenge?  Yeah.  Something like that  in an empty parking  lot with cones.  Give me one of my  friends that can  co-navigate me,  telling me when to  turn and where to  turn.  I'll beat Spaz  in a driving test.  We gotta do this.  Spaz against a  blind guy.  We have to do this.  When can we do  this?  Someone has to  donate a parking  lot.  Yeah, we need a  big empty parking lot.  And like a beat-up  car.  Yeah.  A parking lot,  a beat-up car, 
[01:00:00]  some cones,  and a couple eggs.  And Spaz will go  head-to-head in a  driving obstacle  course with a  blind man.  Yeah.  I'll beat him,  I'm telling you.  All right.  Rick's gonna talk to  you.  All right.  All right, cool.  We've had Dave up  here before.  He is totally blind.  Yeah, he's got those  weird eyes and stuff.  You know something?  I put my money on  Dave.  I swear to you,  I will bet on Dave.  All right, we gotta  make this happen.  We'll set that up.  We just need a parking  lot, some cones.  We'll get some guys  out there to report.  Yeah. 
[01:00:30]  And we'll have this  little driving test  with Spaz and Dave  the blind guy.  The blind guy.  Now, Jeremy's in the  studio.  Jeremy, have you seen  any of the damage?  I've not yet seen all  of the evidence.  Perhaps you can take a  look at some of the  pictures.  First, we get a little  overview of the van.  Look at that beautiful  van.  Here, here, here, the  mirror, back here,  there's some more  damage here. 
[01:01:00]  And he seems to think  it's nothing, and he's  going to go to the  hardware store, get some  black paint and a brush  and just paint it up.  Yeah, how about a  Sharpie?  Yeah, or some black  tape, just sort of put  it right over there.  We have an estimate that  just came in from a guy  that was on the scene.  Uh, the damage, and  this is real, $1,057  worth of damage to the  brand new painted  wild thing.  Oh. 
[01:01:30]  So, uh, we're just  wondering, what's the  protocol?  We, you know, how does  this get taken care of?  Do you fire him or do  it?  Who pays for it to get  it done?  Because we can't have a  piece of crap looking  van.  Normally, I suppose,  whoever did something  like that would put it  on their credit card.  Ah, well, yeah.  Unfortunately, that's,  that's just about $1,053  more than he has on a  card. 
[01:02:00]  How much credit you got  on your card, Love?  $4.36.  Yeah, pretty much.  That'll cover the  paintbrush.  $4.36.  How much was your  credit line?  $5,500.  What do you have to  show for it?  Uh, booths that you  can't walk in.  My new home.  Your new home.  It's not a home.  You're renting.  You're renting.  Renting.  So what do you have to  show for it?  Nothing.  Rent.  You paid rent.  I've reclined.  You paid rent with your  credit card?  All $3,600.  The first month, the 
[01:02:30]  security.  The security and last.  Do you know you're  paying 19% interest on  your rent?  No, there's a  cash address.  I'll take that.  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Now you're talking  probably closer to 24%  interest.  On, you will be paying  off your first and  last month's security.  By the time you pay  that off, you could  have lived in Trump  Towers.  Right.  The St. Regis.  St. Regis.  The butler.  You could have ironing  your heavy metal shirt.  Yeah.  Rick, line one, Mike  has a car that we  could use for the  competition with  Blind Dave and Spaz. 
[01:03:00]  A Brady Bunch  driving test that we're  going to do very, very  soon.  So if Blind Dave wins,  should he get Spaz's  job?  Yeah.  Yeah, we've got to have  him drive the van.  We just need to get  some Braille for the  phone system.  He'll be all right.  Unbelievable, Spaz.  Jumbo.  Yeah.  What's up?  How you doing, fellas?  Great.  Listen, why don't you  save yourself some time  and have all your future  sticker stops at the  body shops?  That's a good idea.  They can just repair  the damage as it  happens.  Yeah, you kill two  birds with one stone,  you know?  That's funny. 
[01:03:30]  Thank you.  Syndication never,  y'all.  Oh, y'all.  Rock, let's go to  Brian.  Brian, you're next on  N.E.W.  I can't believe this  idiot.  He sounds like  the Corley in  Fast Times at  Ridgemont High.  I can fix it.  I got a real awesome  tool set, baby.  I didn't know I was  going to hit at the  pole with eons away.  Which way did he go,  George?  He's stupid.  Yes, he is.  Someone says we should  paint little numbers  on the van first  before Spaz paints it.  That'll be more his  speed. 
[01:04:00]  All right, Brian.  Oh, later.  Just in case you're  wondering, we will be  doing Spaz's weekend  review tomorrow, too.  People want to know if  the invisible man was  injured in the crash.  No, he was fine.  A little whiplash.  And Tom from  Farmingdale.  Too bad Spaz wasn't  there when JFK was  shot.  He could have put the  president's head back  together with makeup.  Freaking fool.  He's going to fix it  with a paintbrush.  All right.  Enough on that.  We're going to make 
[01:04:30]  a little lake right  about here.  Yeah.  Very good, Spaz.  Good job.  Someone is suggesting  whiteout.  Well, that's pretty funny.  Someone's doing a  cartoon.  Spaz died for $39.95.  He'll paint any car.  Wendy.  Hey, Wendy.  Wendy.  Wendy.  Something tells us  that's not a real name.  That's okay.  Wendy.  Very good.  Thanks for waiting.  What's going on? 
[01:05:00]  You can hear me?  Yeah.  Cool.  All right.  I just had to say  Spaz, definitely  good driver.  Definitely.  All right.  Definitely good driver.  Definitely good driver.  All right.  Good.  Maybe I'll wow him again.  Yeah.  I did my very first wow.  Yesterday?  Yes, yesterday.  Nice.  And how did it go?  It was crazy because  I saw the sticker  and I had to, like,  follow the guy  because he was pissed off  and he was sick.  Well, what happened?  It was traffic,  maybe I think.  It was a lot of traffic.  No one remembers,  like, when they put  the stickers on,  they forget.  Yeah.  They have them. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  So, like,  I'm driving off  and I'm honking at him,  right?  And he thinks I'm honking  at him because, like,  I want him to go.  And I'm honking at him  to get his attention  and, like,  I'm, like,  ripping my shirt off  and stuff.  It was crazy.  I'm like,  please,  I'm, like,  trying not to  rip my shirt off.  Yeah.  People were looking at me.  I got, like,  this old lady next to me,  like...  And you didn't crash  anything, right?  Oh, no, no.  You're ripping off your  clothes and driving  at the same time  and you're a better driver  than Spaz.  Yeah, exactly.  So, did the guy  like the wow?  I think so. 
[01:06:00]  You think so?  I think so.  I had to, like,  carve out of the way  so I didn't, like,  you know,  the grandma  who next to me  was, like,  flipping out.  Well,  she was like,  what?  She was looking at me  like I was, like...  I know.  Well,  thank you, Wendy,  for helping us out  with wow.  Sure.  All right.  Cool.  Cool, dude.  Wow is happening.  Just get the wow  on your car.  Russell from Smithdown  checking in.  I was on the road  yesterday,  so I had my mother  turn to Channel 4  to report to me  what was going on.  Needless to say,  she hung up on me,  slapped me in the face 
[01:06:30]  when I got home,  and thinks I was  behind the whole thing.  You guys suck.  Yeah, the 8-bomb was...  I was a little rough  yesterday, Anthony.  Ouch.  All right,  we've got to take a break.  Enough on Spaz and his crash.  We'll keep you posted  as to how the damage  gets fixed,  and if Spaz  and his little paintbrush  fixes them.  Tomorrow,  we all look forward  to Spaz's Week in Review.  Very popular segment  on the O&A show.  And if you want to see  the wow van for yourself,  I believe Earl's going to be  at Strauss Discount Auto

[01:11:00]  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  All right, I got a problem.  Hey!  I got the latest problem.  What's the matter now?  Getting ready to go into  a hilarious, hopefully,  Gary Glitter bit.  Why is Gorilla Boy here  in the station  when he's supposed to be  at a sticker stop  at 430?  Can we ever get this right?  No.  What?  No.  Oh, no.  This can't be real. 
[01:11:30]  Why is Gorilla Boy  walking the hallway?  Get him in here!  Get him in here!  Are you breached?  We have hundreds of people  waiting at this  wow sticker stop.  Hey, Jeff.  Get over there.  Aren't you supposed  to be at a sticker stop  with Earl?  I'm white.  I don't know the Bronx.  I'm taking a train in.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I'm taking a train in.  The boat is pulling right now.  Earl is on his way already.  Oh, okay.  Earl, if you're listening,  I'll meet you there.  All right.  I'm taking a train in.  I got scared. 
[01:12:00]  I thought no one was there yet.  No, no, no.  Because we've been  advertising 430 stress.  Just count auto, Anthony.  345 Conner Street  in the Bronx without stickers.  I went on MapQuest.com  and I understand  that there is no  concrete pillar yet to stand.  Good.  All right, man.  We'll check in with you  when you get out there.  Yeah, we're heading out now.  All right, good.  I almost had a heart attack.  All right, back to  the Gary Glitter.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey! 
[01:12:30]  Gary Glitter  ended again, it seemed so big.  Well, you want to give  the history of Gary Glitter,  Anthony?  Yeah, well...  He's the one hit wonder,  first of all.  Do you remember this song?  He played at all the  sporting events and whatnot.  This is Gary Glitter.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Yeah.  All right, anyway.  Hey! 
[01:13:00]  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Yeah.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Yeah, well, Gary, uh...  The dog's being famous  for this little song.  He's also famous for, uh...  being a pedophile.  Yeah!  Like, uh...  Like, uh...  Like, uh...  Like, uh...  Small children!  Yeah.  In England, 
[01:13:30]  his home...  His home country  of England, Opie.  Almost like, uh...  He, uh...  He, uh...  He, uh...  He had a problem  with his computer  one day.  Very innocent, right?  So what do you do?  You take it to the, uh...  Computer repair store.  That's how you do.  And, uh...  They plugged it in  and...  Lo and behold,  found a bunch of  kiddie porn  on his hard drive.  Ouch!  So he was arrested  and, uh...  Actually spent some time  in jail  for, uh...  Possession of  child porn 
[01:14:00]  in January.  I was only in  for two months  for possessing  4,000 child  porn pictures.  I'm over here now!  Alright, guys.  We'll get to you.  4,000  kiddie porn pictures  on his computer.  Uh...  Two months  in prison.  Now, it seems  he calls himself  Larry Brillante.  Carrie Glitter  Larry Brillante  or something like that. 
[01:14:30]  Very good.  Very clever, yeah.  Saying that he, uh...  He's a pop star  in England  and he's trying  to entice  a six-year-old girl  and her family  onto his yacht.  The, uh,  bald pedophile  befriended  the family of the girl  called Susie  after telling her  Spanish dad  he was, uh,  famous in Britain.  Brillante  is Spanish  for glitter.  Hey!  This guy can't be 
[01:15:00]  for real.  Yeah, Susie,  uh, Susie's family.  Hey!  Hey!  Uh, last night  he was a sigh of relief  after ejecting  Glitter's offer  to help through  his, uh,  45,000 pound  boat  The Voyager.  The Voyager.  The girl's British  friend, Eileen,  said,  It sends a shiver  down me spine  to think of me  little granddaughter  could have been  near his clutches. 
[01:15:30]  Glitter 55,  his real name,  bald dad,  forced his friendship  on port worker,  uh,  called, uh,  Manuel,  shortly after  sailing into  Soto Grande.  And, uh,  Manuel's wife,  Bev,  uh,  was with him.  And, uh,  the couple  lived next to the  marina with their  daughter,  Susie.  He told Manuel  he was, uh,  so famous  photographers  would be  hunting him  and asked him  to keep a lookout. 
[01:16:00]  Then he told Manuel  he needed a crew  and said that he  could bring his  wife and daughter  on board.  Welcome aboard!  It rubs the lotion  on its skin  and does this  whenever it's told.  Be quiet, huh?  It rubs the lotion  on its skin  or else gets  the hose again.  Uh,  some of the other  British sailors  warned, uh,  the guy  and, uh,  said that he'd  been in prison  for keeping 
[01:16:30]  kiddie porn.  And I guess  that kind of  chased him away.  Johnny Pitten!  Wow!  So, uh,  trying to entice  a family  with a six-year-old  daughter on board  to crew his  ship,  the Voyager.  To set down!  Wow!  Goddamn,  that's disgusting.  Shouldn't the guy  just be shot  after that?  That's just a  twisted story.  That really is.  Why is he out?  Come on,

[01:32:00]  is all over  the internet  it's on eBay  people are trying  to sell it  what can we say  about the atom bomb  man  a lot of people  want us to talk  about it a little  bit here today  sorry that  Anna Kornikova  picture up there  is a little  distracting  I know  wow  just when you  thought you saw  all the  Anna Kornikova  pictures  man  and asked like a  vice  she wants  she wants us  to love her  yeah  I have to track 
[01:32:30]  her down  on the court  and rush her  and try to  snatch her  autograph  do you realize  how close we were  to having Anna Kornikova  live in the studio  Bill  oh yeah  and then we had to  open our damn  big mouths  because I said  what did I say  I wrecked that one  yeah  we had  we had the  interview all lined up  she was coming on  this very program  she was coming on  and it was like a day away  and Rick goes  oh bad news  I'm like what  opened your mouth  she canceled  well all I said was  when she comes in 
[01:33:00]  I'm going to pull out  my junk and run after her  you get scared  yeah  isn't that weird  you can say a crowd's  desperate bid  to snatch her autograph  but you can't say  the desperate bid  to autograph her snatch  Rick wants me to play  this clip  but I don't even think  they allow this on the air  what's the only problem  this one  I don't think  they're allowing that  on the air  it's just the sound  anyway  the atom bomb 
[01:33:30]  finally took place  yesterday  something we've been  talking about  for many months  yeah  we've been getting  the wow signs  on live TV  for what  about six months now  yeah  to the point where  now every newscast  has their reporters  up on the news trucks  they're very frightened  they're very frightened  they're in  pure defensive mode  did you see  the 11 o'clock news  last night  every station  they were on  they might as well  have not gone out  on the streets  last night 
[01:34:00]  they're on top of the vans  with these tight shots  tight shot  where you only see  the reporter's face  no background  none  whatsoever  and they're about  two stories up  like cherry pickers  so on live TV  yesterday  right about  no  what about  six o'clock yesterday  six o'clock  yeah  the atom bomb  made it to TV  yeah  and I don't know  how there's still  so many people  that don't know  what the hell it was  we gave enough hints  like everyone's going  what's the atom bomb  what's the atom bomb  it was another sign 
[01:34:30]  we could say that much  yeah it was a sign  alright  and just think  of the worst word  in the history  of the English language  the one that  if you call  your girlfriend it  it's over  it's over  and even better  when you call  like her mother it  there's just no  recovering from that  it's just done  when you're in an argument  with your lady  and you break that out  yeah  you might as well  start packing your bags  there's no returning  after that  that's like the 
[01:35:00]  under the breath one  but that stops  every argument  cold  you try to have  some  that ends the relationship  at the same time  but there's no more  yelling after that  there's nothing funnier  than looking at her face  right when you say it  you know  hey you wing  the mouth opens up  the eyes pop out  of the head  it's just the funniest thing  and we try to like  have balls and stuff  but we don't  we kind of say  you know  but then you know 
[01:35:30]  something  you say it louder  and louder  I think she might  have heard that one  what  why  what did you just  say  uh  why  then you get all  tough  what do you think  I said  yeah  did you just  call me  yeah  yeah I did  and are you having  a marriage flashback  yeah  god damn 
[01:36:00]  god all the  all my bomber planes  have been decommissioned  for a while  they're collecting dust  you know  we had a breakout  set that  in a long time  you know  we really got to  take the Anna Kornikova  pictures off  all the computer screens  in the studio  wow  look at that one  we are really distracted  we're trying to do a  Anna Kornikova  a creative radio show  today  oh yeah  yeah  that's a good one  the one of her  bending over  yeah  hit that one  real fast  anyway so 
[01:36:30]  the atom bomb  was unveiled  on live TV  yesterday  yeah  and now it's  literally the talk  of New York City  well there  are a lot of  stations wondering  how they can  defend against  such a thing  now  I don't know  you're going to  notice that  reporters are going  to be reporting  very differently  in the coming  weeks and months  just seems like  yesterday  they were debating  over whether  to ever have  the word bitch  on TV  remember all the 
[01:37:00]  black NYPD  blue got  for wanting to  show some ass  stuff like that  I remember the  controversy with  Lenny Bruce  and Steve Allen  Anthony  yeah  Lenny Bruce  wanted to use  the word  snot on TV  snot  couldn't use it  come a long way  Jack Parr  saying water closet  on the air  oh my god  water closet  that whole thing  every time a  lesbian kiss  wants to be on  TV  it's this huge  thing  well we  we said  screw all this 
[01:37:30]  let's go right  for the A-bop  right for the  jugular  it'll make  every  I think we  help television  it'll make  anything else  pale by comparison  yes  what  another shot  of Sipowicz's  fat ass  who cares  at this point  I think we're  just trying to  help our own  TV station  channel 2  yes  at this point  we encourage  the listeners  to leave  channel 2  alone  right Anthony  yeah of course  those can be  funny  all the other 
[01:38:00]  news stations  are going to  have the  tight shot  from the top  of the van  yeah  and channel 2  news will have  the reporter  right on the  sidewalk  knowing you know  our listeners  will leave them  alone now  yeah  CBS  can just do  their live shots  from the street  wide shot  wide panoramic  shots  right  we won't touch  that  no leave them  alone  truly we're saying  leave them alone  yeah  the other  station  they're tight  shots  they're like  doing the  remotes  from inside  boxes  let's go to  Michelle

[01:47:30]  never drop it  in a Bronx  movie theater  C bomb  never drop  ever  yeah  ever  ever  ever  ever  alright let's  go to Frank  Frank you're next  on NEW  hey what's up guys  how are ya  I'm doing pretty good  good  if you're interested  I just happen  to have in front  of me  cause I have  access  the ratings  from yesterday  oh really  if you're interested  was there a little  spike  oh you could say  that  uh what  exactly what time  did the weapon  hit the target  now you're not 
[01:48:00]  BSing us right  no I  um  do you have  the normal  I can  I can confirm  it off the air  do you have  the normal ratings  for the  Channel 4  6 o'clock news  on a regular  slow news day  yes I do  oh well  I only pulled  yesterday  I can pull  another day  to compare  but I was  doing it kind of quick  alright why don't we  just do this then  it's the 6 o'clock news  the first quarter hour  uh the 6 o'clock news  first quarter  whoa whoa whoa  let's uh let's do the build up  Channel 2 news  alright  yesterday from 6 to 6.15  what kind of uh ratings  do they get  uh 6.7 with a 14 
[01:48:30]  ok  so 6.7 rating  with a 14 share  alright let's go to  Channel 7  6 o'clock news  from 6 to 6.15  6.1 with a 13  comparable  they're both uh  almost even  in the sixes  right  Channel 4 news  6 o'clock yesterday  between 6 and 6.15  when the A-bomb was dropped  uh it's only down  to the quarter hour level  I can only give you  the 6.7 with a 14  so it's  they had a  well they were number one  oh they were definitely  number one  alright  but you guys started  talking about it  at 5 
[01:49:00]  right  at 5 o'clock  the rating was a 7.3  with a 19  so people got a little  bored  it dropped around  to a 7.2  so  so if you're  if you're Channel 4  are you pissed or happy  they've got to be happy  I mean they're probably  pissed because you know  the A-bomb  was dropped on them  but they've got to be  happy with the  overnight ratings  absolutely  and the WCBS  is really pissed  because they did  a 3.6 with a 7  oh damn  because we told them  that we weren't 
[01:49:30]  going to do that  you know see  we're trying to be  team players  by involving  the company  in our little hijinks  we can help the news  yeah we sure can  we can help your newscast  because we did spend  like a half hour  saying we will not do it  to our own company  Channel 2 CBS  and what was their rating again  for the first hour news  it was a 7.2  with an 18  yeah  and for the quarter hour  when the bomb was dropped  it was a 6.7  with a 14  oh okay  so they did very good  but I mean  as you guys know 
[01:50:00]  working in the business  you're totally confusing us now  what was the 3.6  3.6 was WCBS  that's what I'm saying  oh I'm sorry  I'm sorry  that's what I mean  so we told everyone  that it wasn't going to happen  on Channel 2  and what was their rating  3.4  the 5 to 6 news  did a 3.4 rating  with an 8 share  alright  and we said it would be  at that point  it was pretty obvious  it was going to be  Channel 4  what was their rating  a 7.2 with an 18  yeah  see  I want to apologize  to 
[01:50:30]  Channel 2 News  boss  boss  could you get  full funnel nudity  on Channel 2 News  please  we all thought  this one out here  and  that'd be advantageous  Anthony  we doubled  the TV audience  for the competition  that's right  because they told us  leave  our own affiliates alone  right  we know  what works here  we know  what would  oh boy  you figure boobs  are worth a couple  of share points 
[01:51:00]  I mean  they should be so mad  yeah  oh that's funny  oh man  kind of  pathetic  and funny  what I can do guys  is I'll look up  what the news  normally does  and I'll call  Spaz back  and if it's worth  something  he'll let you know  if not  no problem  yeah well  let us know  what happened  the day before  when it was just  a regular  you know  ok I'll do that  and call back  ok  alright guys  bye  wow  hey Brian  hey  how are you Brian  good  what's up  hey  shouldn't the  shouldn't the name

What do you mean you only got one job?  I know I should've got like five, man.  I just got one, man.  I got a good one.  Mike works downstairs.  He's a great guy.  Yeah.  Great guy.  That's when I knew, by the way, that's when I knew Ant and I were starting to do pretty  well in the ratings because I'm like, you listen to our show? 
[02:04:00]  Because one day he finally said, hey, how's that wow, man?  Or whatever you said.  Wow, man.  Or something about the show.  And I looked at Ant like, oh, wait a minute.  Maybe the show is working.  You know what?  What do you, what business do you have?  Listen to a couple white boys.  What do you have?  What do you have?  Listen to a couple white boys on Black Island?  When was the last time you were back in Mexico?  Seven years.  Really?  When do you get back there more often?  I'm going out on the first week of August.  It's because it's a smorgasbord up here.

[02:05:00]  The giant Air Jamaican penis.  Lenny, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going?  All right.  Hey, man.  I was in Jamaica like Easter week.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  Me and my buddy went to a brewery resort.  It was all inclusive.  We had a great time.  But, you know, it was amazing that every girl, it was like all these white girls.  It's all they wanted was these Jamaicans.  That's right.  I mean, the guys are great guys.  They're, you know, great personalities and everything.  But there was even, we saw these three girls walking around with wedding rings, okay? 
[02:05:30]  And there's one girl, I saw her three nights in a row at the club.  She's hitting on this one guy, hanging all over him.  I'm telling you, it's insane.  So the moral of the story is, if you're looking to hook up, don't go to Jamaica.  Yeah, really, if you're looking to hook up, we'll bring shoe polish.  All right, let's go to Becca.

[02:07:30]  I don't have fake nails, though.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We've got to play the intro.  Ah.  It's time to play.  Hey.  It's time to play.  Hey.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants.  Yes, yes.  It's time to play.  Hey.  It's time to play.  Come on.  Are you ready?  Hold on.  It's time to play.  Yeah.  All right.  So you know how to play What's in My Pants, right?  Oh, yeah.  Jamaica, Mike, do you know how to play, right?  No. 
[02:08:00]  Oh.  Well, we, uh.  Boy, thanks for being a faithful listener.  I don't.  I don't.  No, you don't.  It's all right.  What she does is she's going to rub the phone all over her, you know?  Her thing.  We have to guess.  Yeah.  What her hair is shaped in.  Okay.  Yeah.  And, of course, you don't reveal, Becca, until we ask you.  Right.  So, Becca?  Yes.  Go ahead.  Okay.  If I stump him, can I get wrestling tickets?  Um, yeah.  Come on.  Yeah, that's fine.  It wrestles Jamaica and Mike.  Yeah. 
[02:08:30]  It wrestles the monster.  Right.  Oh, my God.  If you, uh.  I can play rock, please.  I believe we have a sound clip with Becca when she meets Jamaica and Mike.  Okay.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  All right, Becca. 
[02:09:00]  If you stumped Jamaican Mike, we'll give you wrestling tickets, but you can't lie.  Oh, I won't lie.  All right.  Very good.  I'll miss you.  Okay.  All right.  Why don't you rub the phone up and down?  Okay.  Hold on.  Listen carefully.  Whoa.  Did you hear?  Yeah.  It sounds like you lost it.  Right.  All right.  Was that up and down?  Yeah, it was up and down.  Now, do a side to side.  Okay.  Hold on.  Slowly. 
[02:09:30]  Okay.  Was that good?  Okay.  Now, a circular motion.  Very slowly.  Okay.  Hold on.  Sounds like she's going over a large pothole.  Maybe she is, though.  How many times have you been in Jamaica?  Nothing, Becca.  Okay.  Okay.  Do you need to hear circular again?  No, I got a pretty good line on this, I think. 
[02:10:00]  You do?  Yeah.  I'm going to go off of my normal.  Well, let your mic go first.  All right.  Oh, you don't need me to do it again?  Yeah, I want to hear it one more time.  All right.  Go ahead.  One more time?  Circular motion.  Circular motion.  Okay.  Hold on a second.  Is that okay?  Yes.  That's very good.  All right.  To our guest, Jamaican Mike.  The choices are triangle, basic triangle.  Hitler mustache, which is a very short little thin thing. 
[02:10:30]  Okay.  The mohawk, which is self-explanatory.  Or the wood floor.  Totally clean.  Or the pool rack filled with dreadlocks.  No, that's not a dreadlock, so...  No, definitely not.  I would say wood floor.  Wood floor?  Okay.  Anthony?  I am going to say mohawk.  Mohawk.  Mohawk.  See? 
[02:11:00]  The cans are in the news.  It's all over.  It's a wood floor.  Becca!  Yeah.  What is in your pants?  Okay.  Well, it's not a wood floor.  Okay?  Yeah?  What were the other ones you said?  I said mohawk.  Okay.  Well, it's not that.  But it's very, very, very, very thin.  It's very, very, very close.  Like, it's like not even in half a minute.  Okay.  But it's thin.  Oh, you got a little, like, exclamation point.  It's very, very thin. 
[02:11:30]  It doesn't matter how thick it is, Opie.  A mohawk is a line of hair.  Is it a line of hair?  Yep.  And it's not short like a little Hitler mustache.  No, but it's just, like, long.  There you go.  I'm giving myself the victory.  Anthony won again, but you did stomp Jamaican Mike, so we will give you the wrestling tickets.  Cool.  Thank you so much.  Becca, thanks for playing What's in My Pants.  Thank you.  Any final words to Jamaican Mike?  Not really.  All right.  I seem to say. 
[02:12:00]  All right.  Hold on the line, Becca.  There she goes.  Give her the wrestling tickets.  And we've got to take a quick break.  A bunch of people on hold.  They've got Jamaican stories.  Oh, my God.  This could get pretty interesting.  Look at Poe Jason on line nine.  I know.  My fiancé in Jamaican now without me.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Maybe you can tell him what's...  Yeah.  Okay.  We'll go to him after break, and you can tell him maybe what he can expect when she gets back.  Wait.  Wait.  Do that again. 
[02:12:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Here's his fiancé.  I got a couple of gratas down here.  Yodel-o-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee.  You're looking low.  Ono-geo.  Honey?  Honey?  You're back from Jamaican.  What the hell's that sound?  That's amazing.  That's all, man.  All right.  We'll go to the phones next.  O.P. and Anthony, 107-WNEW. 
[02:13:00]  Anthony, the Diamond Exchange.  Yeah, this is great, man.  You want to see how faithful your woman is.  You know, send her to Jamaica.  See if she comes back in one piece.  Yeah.  You know that she's been faithful at that point, and it might be time to pop the question.  That's probably a good litmus test, is to, well, you get yourself some spackle, right?  Right.  And your spackle close some areas.  And then send it to Jamaica.  See if it comes back looking like the wall behind the door where the knob hits it. 
[02:13:30]  You know?  If it comes back looking like that, maybe it's not time to make the commitment.  But if it comes back all sealed up still, head for the Diamond Exchange.  Immediately.

Honey, what happened?  You're missing a few teeth.  All right.  It's the Diamond Exchange.  Give them a call.  Huh?  1-800-550-0633. 
[02:15:00]  We're hanging with our new friend, Jamaica and Mike, Anthony.  Well, he's been a friend for quite a while now.  Well, he's new to the radio audience and stuff.  Yeah.  212-757-1027.  We're talking about Jamaica.  And how paranoid we get when our ladies go down there without us.  Because they run into guys like Mike here.  Oh, forget about it.  That's it.  They're coming back ruined.  What was once, boy, tighter than a thimble, is now like, remember the old movie you see where 
[02:15:30]  the mother comes out and wants everybody to come back to the house for vittles.  So she puts the thing in that triangle bell and goes,  bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling.  That's what it ends up looking like.  What happened?  Wow.  What the hell happened?  She went to Jamaica.  Like throwing a crowbar down an empty hallway.  Down the hallway.  Let's go to Jason.  He's over, Johnny.  Jason's getting really paranoid because I guess his fiancee is in Jamaica right now without him. 
[02:16:00]  Jason, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  What's up?  Talking to you.  Let's go.  So your fiancee is in Jamaica?  Yeah.  I'm home laying tiles.  And my buddy walked in.  Oh, guess what?  Insert your own joke there.  Someone is laying tiles in Jamaica right now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what I figured.  She's laying tile, too.  He resides on the beach.  Huh?  She's laying tile, too.  Yeah, I bet she is.  His name's tile.  This sucks. 
[02:16:30]  Where's Jamaican Mike?  They got those wacky names down there.  Hey, I'm tile.  Come on.  Meet Dexter and tile.  Dexter St. John, right?  All right.  Yeah, swing it.  So you want to ask Jamaican Mike a question?  Yeah, well, if I might ask, what happened?  What happened?  And should I take the ring back now?  No.  Don't take it back, man.  She's just having fun.  Yeah, no.  She certainly is.  If you're lucky, dude, she'll maybe just be one of the smaller guys, 8 to 10 inches. 
[02:17:00]  And you'll still have something left to salvage when she gets back.  Oh, Jason.  She's down there right now?  She's down there right now?  Have you talked to her?  Yeah, she's been calling me every night.  Every night, huh?  Every night.  Plus, you're just making sure you're not supposing her down there.  Yeah.  You know, because when you get the phone call, you know you have at least six, seven hours. 
[02:17:30]  If she calls from the airport, if you call, forget about it.  She's coming home tomorrow, though.  Oh, she is?  She was only there for five days, so it's only minimal damage, hopefully.  Hey, wait a minute.  We have some audio from your fiancée.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah?  I just need to make a touch.  Yeah.  I guess you guys need to be cleanser. 
[02:18:00]  I believe it.  She's gone.  Oh, man.  Have you girls ever gone there?  No.  Oh, God.  I guess you're not that tough, huh?  No.  No, it's good.  It's all good.  Don't worry.  Don't worry. 
[02:18:30]  Don't worry.  Don't worry.  Mike says it's all good, all right?  It's all good.  Oh, it's all good.  It's all good.  I'll let you know if she comes home, and I have to go, hello, hello.  All right.  Come on to me.  Thank you.  All right?  Oh, man.  There you go, Jason.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  How you doing?  Hey, Jay.  So, I feel bad for Jay's girl, I'll tell you.  Well, for Jay.  This girl's out there getting it right now, isn't she? 
[02:19:00]  What?  Dang.  Probably a bunch.  My ex-girlfriend didn't call me at all when she was away.  Dirty pig.  I don't know, man.  I tell you, she came back, though.  It was terrible.  It was like throwing a hot dog down a hallway.  I can't tell you, man.  I've had, I don't know, tired of sex with a Cheerio.  It's really a bad thing, I think, once they get down there.  Your joke would have been funnier if you said you had tighter sections like an inner tube,  by the way.  Yeah.  That, too. 
[02:19:30]  Cheerio is tight.  Cheerio is very tight.  It was all right, though.  It's a little rough.  We can all dream, I guess, though, right?  Okay.  Thank you, Dave.  All right.  Have a good one, guys.  See, this is what we didn't want to hear.  Now the ladies are calling.  Tammy is going to crush all of us.  Tammy, what's going on?  Say it.  Go ahead, Tammy.  Say it.  Say it.  It's true.  What?  What's true? 
[02:20:00]  What's true?  Wait, hold on a second.  What's true?  Keep it.  What is she doing?  Tammy, what, are you working?  No, no, I was at the gas station.  They asked me to turn my car off.  What's longer?  The guys slung in Jamaica or the gas hose coming out of the pump?  That's a sling.  Oh, yeah?  Well, what do you want to say?  Yeah, what do you want to say?  We're doing a radio show here.  Tammy.  If they're going to Jamaica, I won't come back.  I think she's been bludgeoned with Jamaican members. 
[02:20:30]  Over her head.  And she's a little slow now.  There's a bunch of dents in her brain.  Man, help us out.  How does a girl talk her boyfriend into going to Jamaica alone?  It's like, could you go to your girlfriend and go, yeah, well, I'm just going to go visit, like, a whorehouse in Vegas.  Yeah, and I got all these free coupons for, like, free Hummers and, you know, butt stacks and stuff. 
[02:21:00]  You know, I'll just go there.  Later.  Oh, man, what's going on?  Hey, Matt.  Hello.  What's wrong with you, Matt?  I'm just scared, Matt.  Come on, man.  Matt.  Hello.  Yeah, Matt.  Yeah, what's up, man?  What's up?  I can't hear you.  You can hear us just fine.  Let's go.  Okay, okay, okay.  Yo, I was on TV last night with the whore sign.  I got you on the 7-11 now.  He can't hear it because a white woman's thighs are over his ears. 
[02:21:30]  I think that's probably what's going on now.  Seriously.  All right, this show's getting too big.  Even people that don't understand English are starting to listen to us now.  That's right.  I'm from France.  Oh, you're a Frenchie.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  I'm from France, but I still know what whore means.  You know what?  What?  Whore.  Whore means.  Oh, whore.  He knows what whore means.  W-O-W.  You know that's correct.  So you got a whore on your car?  No, actually, I had it on my board.  Like a little board for messenger.  A little board.  That's right.  A boat? 
[02:22:00]  No, like a board.  Like a board for messenger where you put all the delivery on it, on the back of it.  Oh, a board.  Yeah.  So I got a little fleek.  They had all of these signs, you know, at Big City Apple.  Uh-huh.  And, you know, I just like walked through them.  And I put the wall right through the camera and...  Hey, Matt, Matt, Matt.  Yeah.  How does spaz is an idiot sound in another language?  Say...  Repeat after me.  Spaz is an idiot.  Spaz is an idiot.  Spaz is an idiot.  Say it in French. 
[02:22:30]  Say it in French.  Spaz is an idiot.  You're a good kid.  I'm a good kid.  It sounds like you're ready to regurgitate.  Actually, you know what?  I just girls in France.  What?  I just girls in French.  Oh, you just girls in French?  I girls in French, but you couldn't believe me.  Oh, you girls.  Girls.  Of course.  Of course.  We will believe you.  You girls?  Yeah, just girls in French.  Girls.  Girls.  Girls.  No, we got you. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, okay.  Yeah, we understand.  All right, Anthony, you're the man.  Ah, yes.  I see you all the time when you get down to 800 7th Avenue.  When you get outside.  I was there when G was...  A little frighten now.  I was there when G was putting on a bike.  G Moore?  Oh, yeah.  I was outside and you were on your cellulopone.  I took a picture of you.  Okay, terrific.  Hey, hey, hey.  Oui, oui, oui. 
[02:23:30]  All right, thank you, Matt.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Okay.  Now I'm really afraid.  Hey.  Someone wants...  Inspector Clouseau.  Christopher LeBron wants to make Mike to say,  look what I did to you again.  With that accent of his.  Mike, you have to say that for us.  Just saying, look what I did to you again.  Look what I did to you again.  Yeah, you got to do the pause. 
[02:24:00]  We'll isolate it.  Look what I did to you again.  Look what I did to you again.  Yeah, I'm on.  Barry, what's going on?  I'm calling in about the fact of the Jamaicans.  A man that called in earlier that said that his fiance is down there and he's calling him.  Yeah.  Better watch out.  Because I live with the Jamaicans.  Yeah.  And that little stereotype about the big thing is true.  It's true. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, yeah.  My boyfriend's from Toulon.  Toulon?  I'm from St. Thomas.  Okay.  St. Thomas.  Between Portland and Kingston.  Right.  He's got family there as well.  They make the distance in penis over there.  So that's like, what, 25 penis away or something like that?  Wow.  All right.  And, Mary, he just pounds you and pounds you.  Oh.  He takes care of it every night.  Mary, how huge is it? 
[02:25:00]  Is it like a shopping bag now?  Can you remember when it was the size of a normal private area?  No.  No.  Seven years.  I do, yeah.  Seven years in order to take care of it.  That's all that fits.  Does it give you acid reflux from hitting your stomach?  That's like an old man's mouth when he pops his teeth out.  Oh, my God. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, man.  You walk like you have a rash all the time.  No.  No?  You get used to it after a while, but I'm not going nowhere else.  But that's it.  You can't, there's no turning back now.  You set the bar at a certain level, and it's over.  When you're naked and you're walking around your house, does it sound like you're wearing corduroys? 
[02:26:00]  No, it's fine.  But he takes care of it, and well, Jamaican, that's not true.  When you get into the bathtub, the water levels are down.  Well, I love you.  You guys are great.  He got me into listening to you.  You're wrong.  Thank you.  Man.  That's something. 
[02:26:30]  We're breaking the ground here.  Finding out Jamaicans have really big ones.  Geez.  Sarah.  Yeah.  Hey, how are you?  Very good.  How are you guys?  Very, very good.  You guys are the greatest.  You make my drive home the greatest.  Thank you.  When I was down in Jamaica, they had lots of wooden statues with these large Jamaican junk, if you will.  Really?  They call it the big bamboo.  They have shirts that say, who's afraid of the bamboo?  That's how you get used to looking at it on a statue before you have to see the real thing, I'm sure. 
[02:27:00]  If you want to try it out, you can back into it.  It's the plunger thing all over, Dad.  Oh, man.  So, did you have any of that Jamaican sex down there?  No, I didn't.  I was 12, but a lot of Jamaican rinsed it in me.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yeah.  Have a great day, guys.  All right.  Take care.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Brad.  Hot and huge penises.  Why would girls come back?  Why do they come back?  Yeah.  Why do they come back, Mike? 
[02:27:30]  That's like a strip club that gives away free beer and never closes.  Right.  Why would the guy leave?  Brad.  ONA, what's up, guys?  How are you?  How are you doing, Jamaican, Mike?  I'm doing pretty good.  You?  I'm doing all right.  All right.  I got this ridiculous story.  I better be careful how I tell it to be on the radio, but do you hear it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So a friend of mine, this is a close friend of mine, he went down to Jamaica for spring break  this year, and he went into this bar, and they were actually having, what's the best 
[02:28:00]  way to put this?  Just some random girls at the bar.  They were having an oral contest.  How's that?  Whoa.  Like a hummer contest?  Absolutely.  So girls that were just at the bar were giving hummers to guys?  He said basically it were a bunch of random guys they had lined up there, and they were  just picking out of these just drunk girls that were just at the bar, and they all, you  know, got down and bought prizes and drinks and stuff like that. 
[02:28:30]  Whoa.  He said it was pretty unbelievable.  Yeah.  Keep going, baby.  Keep going.  Keep going.  I'm almost there.  It's all good, though.  It's all good.  All right, Brad.  Take care.  Thank you.  Let's go to John.  John, how are you?  Hey.  How you doing, guys?  All right. 
[02:29:00]  Pretty good.  Hey, my sister-in-law went down to Jamaica.  She hooked up with a guy named Wellington, and she noticed he had W-E-L, well, tattooed on  his junk.  She said, hey, that's cute.  But you got your name on your junk.  And he said, no, no.  It says, welcome to Jamaica, Mom.  Have a nice day.  Matt, old guy.  Matt, old guy.  Sorry.  See ya.  I'll talk to you all.  You make that one of them.  Yeah.  Johnny, what's up?  Hey, man.  What's going on?  How are you? 
[02:29:30]  I got a funny Jamaican story for you.  I had no idea what Jamaican was all about.  The men's units down there were huge.  Ten years ago, get married, right?  My wife and I, we were only with each other before that.  We were two virgins on our honeymoon.  We got down there.  And, you know, you go to the club med scene or the hotel down there, and you just stay  kind of by yourself.  Well, one night we decided to venture out to go to the local scene to kind of catch out  what's going on.  Biggest mistake ever.  We go to this luau, this type of thing where, like, all the local guys are there. 
[02:30:00]  We're hanging around a bonfire, eating, drinking.  All of a sudden, my wife starts dancing with one of these guys.  And this guy started sporting wood, if you know what I'm saying.  Oh, my God.  Dude, that thing could have covered half of D.C.  It was like an umbrella in shape.  Can we see your stuff? 
[02:30:30]  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Torture!  It's torture!  Wow.  So what happened, Josh?  So I'm sitting there in amazement, and her eyes are like the snake from Jungle Book. 
[02:31:00]  You know what I mean?  That, you know, that snake with the eyes are all googly-eyed, and she's just, like, staring  at that thing.  It has never been the same.  Ten years later, it has never been the same.  She looks at, like, bananas different now.  Oh, yeah?  Hmm, chicken in my mouth.  Of course, talking about the joints.  Yeah, the joints.  The joints.  Oh, yeah.  Hey.  Ouch.  I never, I never sized up since then. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  I just have to thank, you know, the Jamaican men for ruining it for the rest of us, small  white men.  Thanks a lot, Mike.  All right.  Take care.  All right, Johnny.  Bye-bye.  Wow.  Natural, man.  Oh, my God.  That's awful.  That was hilarious.  The snake from Jungle Book.  Wow.  You're getting this big.  You're just looking at that.  Wow.  That's horrible. 
[02:32:00]  Her face is like those wacky paintings you see in the subway where the girls have the big,  a few guys.  Hey, Mike.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  How are you doing?  All right, I got a story for you.  Yeah.  I was down in Jamaica for spring break about two months ago.  All right, I'm at this bar.  First of all, these guys, these local guys are cool.  They flock to the bars, and they just, you know, will stand around all cool in the back  of the bar.  There's plane loads of white chicks coming in.  I mean, why wouldn't you want to go to the bars? 
[02:32:30]  I see.  Because another one, man.  We go out.  I see the hottest white girl I've ever seen.  All right.  I see her.  I don't have the courage to go talk to her.  Finally, like on the third night, I get a couple of red stripes for me.  I'm going to go and talk to her.  I see her in the corner of the bar hooking up with this Russ Therese guy, this Jamaican  guy.  She's rubbing his junk.  She's all over the sky, and I am just heartbroken.  And my confidence the entire week just went down the tube, man.  It was tremendous.  Why did you try to forget about it, man?  Here's you. 
[02:33:00]  Exactly.  Hey, Jamaican, Mikey.  And there's you.  I did that comparison again.  That's too good.  White guy.  White guy in Jamaica.  And the guy that she was with at the bar. 
[02:33:30]  Anthony.  Yo.  How are you?  I was down in Jamaica a couple weeks ago.  Yeah.  And there I am.  I hook up with these two girls, and I meet one of the guys to the entertainment guy of  the resort I was at.  Uh-huh.  And we end up going back to their room, you know, having some fun with the girls.  I see this guy's hammer come out.  Yeah, yeah.  Biggest thing I have ever done.  It didn't get any bigger. 
[02:34:00]  It was just, it was like down to like almost his knee.  And the damn thing, it didn't get any bigger.  It didn't swell.  It just stood up.  Like a sleeping Doberman, you know, when they wake up and they just get up?  The damn thing just stood up and looked at me.  And I said, oh, my God, I had to get the hell out of there.  I lost it.  I just walked out of the room.  I'll see you later, Precious. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, my God.  Darren, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  How you doing?  I'm doing all right.  Yeah, I got a friend who's a waiter, and he's got a buddy at work.  They're making guys.  He's got into a contest in this country for the biggest team.  They have these contests down there in little villages.  He's got a 14-inch team.  And guess what, guys?  He came in third place. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, man.  I mean, if I go down there, I'll have to enter the women's competition.  And I'll probably lose.  Thank you, guys.  No.  I'll take care.  Use it or lose it.  Damn.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  John Zilla. 
[02:35:30]  Ed, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  You're going to make me drive off the road.  I was down in Jamaica at one of these all-inclusive resorts, and they had this guy, the body man,  who took us all on a picnic.  There were five guys.  Five white guys.  The big big man.  Yeah.  Five white girls and the body man.  The body man.  He takes us out into the ocean, into like five feet water.  And we stopped in these drinking games with rum punch and everything. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  Well, one thing leads to another, and everybody starts to get naked.  And, of course, what happens when white guys go in the ocean?  They get the turtle head.  So, there are five of us standing there.  I've never been more humiliated in my life.  He takes down his shorts, and this thing is down like three-quarters of the way down his thigh. 
[02:36:30]  Nine of women waiting to get it on with him.  Oh, man.  That's great, man.  That's great.  Why the hell could you get me all down there?  Oh, great.  Why would you take off your trunks, let's say, if you know you have a turtle head?  Biggest mistake of my life.  He said if you wanted to stay there, you had to take your shorts off.  Oh, yeah, sure.  It eliminates the competition. 
[02:37:00]  Exactly.  That's their plan.  They get whitey down there, and they take advantage of it.  Look at what we need to, man.  I love you.  Oh, my God.  God damn it, you guys are hilarious.  I'm awful.  Oh, Bob.  Yeah, hey, how's it going, guys?  Doing well.  Well, you know, one thing that the white American male probably has over the Jamaican schlong is a tongue. 
[02:37:30]  Because Jamaicans will not use it on women.  Is that you or Jamaican, Mike?  Well, that's true, but a lot of guys started doing it now, but before, they never used to do it.  Well, you got to go down to the big schlong contest, but if you can stand in the corner and lick your eyebrows, you'll probably get more weird.  Yeah, you keep telling yourself that, Bob.  Well, you don't think I can do that?  You keep telling yourself that.  Oh, come on. 
[02:38:00]  Thank you, Bob.  Not in Jamaica, so we're in.  Mark.  Hey, dude.  Hey.  Oh, man, I went into CVS like two weeks ago, and they said, oh, hey, your wife's got pictures.  You want to pick them up?  I said, yeah, sure.  What the heck?  She was down in Jamaica.  I'm in the car, man.  She's down there with her girlfriend.  I got pictures of her, her girlfriend, and Long Don Silver laying in the bed.  All laying in the bed?  Yeah.  And I'm like, what the hell am I going to do with this now? 
[02:38:30]  You know what I mean?  I pulled the picture out.  She hasn't said anything.  I don't even know.  And I said, okay, fine, who took the damn picture?  You guys are killing it, man.  Maybe they had the camera set up on a tripod, and he just hit it with his slong.  I think he pulled it with the end of his slong, because I couldn't see the tip of it.  Wow.  That's funny, Mark.  I'm on, too, man.  It's the Jamaican horse lonely club.  You're killing it.  All right, Mark.  Thank you. 
[02:39:00]  God bless you, Mon.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Yo, Mon.  We'll do that.  Uh, Lloyd.  Hey.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  What's up, Lloyd?  Hey, man.  I went to Jamaica around two years ago, and I'm hooking up with this black Jamaican girl.  And she's telling me that I'm the first white guy she's ever had, right?  I bring her back to the hotel room.  And I'm around, like, seven inches.  So I'm like, you know, I think that I'm good and stuff.  And I whip it out, and it's all ready.  I'm ready to go.  And she says, wait a minute, you need some Viagra, I got some Viagra, some Viagra. 
[02:39:30]  I'm like, what do you mean, Viagra?  I'm like, this is me, man.  What are you talking about?  She's like, no, no, I got some Viagra.  Hold on, wait a minute.  Not big enough, Lord.  Seven inches, man.  What's up with these Jamaicans?  I'm rich, though, man.  All right.  You guys will, man.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Oh, man, this is too fun for that.  It's long for.  Chris.  Hey, Chris.  Yeah.  How are you?  All right.  All right.  What do you got?  There's a website, and they got this Jamaican guy with this huge... 
[02:40:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  You got to start on her.  You can't curse.  There's a Jamaican website.  It's a regular website.  Yeah.  But they got this Jamaican guy on it.  Okay.  Stretching, twisting his things around, and then he lifts like a big rock with it.  It's punchbaby.com.  Punchbaby.com?  Yeah.  You got to go to the left.  It says, ouch.  And then it says a bunch of things.  You know, there's a bunch of, like, little links to go into. 
[02:40:30]  All right.  And you got to go to Stretchy.  Thank you.  All right.  Later.  Bye.  I don't know if these are real, but...  He's probably joking, man.  You know, Tommy checking in from Fairline.  Because you know a woman's been in Jamaica too long when she thinks anaconda is a porn flick.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's great, man.  That's horrible, man. 
[02:41:00]  Why would a guy go down there?  Why would a crazy white boy go down...  Oh, this guy.  Jamaica.  Hey, look at this clip.  I've seen this clip.  Oh, what's the, uh...  Oh, the guy that lifts up with his schlong.  Yeah.  Well, I can understand that you're a single guy, maybe.  You want to go down there and smoke more pot than you've ever smoked in your life.  That's one thing.  But if you've got a chick and you go down there, you're insane. 
[02:41:30]  Or if you let your chick go down there alone or with one of her girlfriends.  Oh.  Like, that's going to help.  Oh, she'll go with a girlfriend.  She'll protect each other.  No.  Skewered like shish kebab, the two of them.  Like a piece of beef and a pepper on a skewer.  That's it, man.  All right.  Quick break, and we'll be back.  We'll be a bad solution.  I can't say a computer.  1027.  Don't go to CNN for dick jokes. 
[02:42:00]  Don't come here for the news.  We'll be an Anthony show.  I like it when the show's dirty.  1027.  WNEW.  But you can watch the news and listen to the radio at the same time, and you might see something very interesting.  Like yesterday, right after that.  Yeah.  All right.  We're having fun with our new friend, Jamaican Mike. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm on.  We were going to move on here, but the phones are just lit.  Oh, my God.  Hey, all the guys in the garage rooting on the Knicks there, Mike.  No?  Not those guys don't get into Boston bars.  Really?  Yeah.  Not a funny guy.  I don't know.  We don't really talk about it, guys.  Do you talk at all to each other down there?  Sometimes.  Yeah?  They're going to razz you tomorrow.  That's good.  That's all good.  All right. 
[02:43:00]  We've got to go to Barbara.  Barbara says that she's been to Jamaica 15 times.  Oh, my God.  Barbara.  Hi.  You've been to Jamaica 15 times.  Yes, I've been to Jamaica 15 times.  The very first time I ever went, the day I came back, I went back to the travel agent and said,  I'm going again.  What's the reason why?  But I...  Excuse me?  Oh, sorry.  It's okay.  You can talk.  What's the reason that you like it so much?  Well, I ended up, after about my 13th time, marrying a Jamaican guy here in New York. 
[02:43:30]  Well, you had to.  For the normal guy, having sex with you is like having sex with a warm glass of water.  Excuse me?  That's not necessarily the case.  It's terrible.  Mike, tell him that that's not the case.  Yeah, look at you laughing for a while.  I don't know.  No, I don't think so.  You've got to be a reason, though.  But then, I think besides the sex, there's something about Jamaican guys. 
[02:44:00]  Nice.  Very nice.  And I've traveled a lot of different places.  There's some kind of, I don't know what it is, an aura about them.  Yes.  And I mean, I didn't just go down there and play around.  I mean, I went down there and I came back up here and I started going to Jamaican clubs and stuff.  Met a guy and married him and have a wonderful son.  That's great.  All right.  So, that birth was no problem, huh?  Hey, Joel, keeping it in for nine months. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, I sneezed.  I almost gave birth.  Oh, that was terrible.  You guys are awful.  All right, Mara.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay.  Thank you a lot.  Bye-bye.  She wears one of those nettings that you see on the Thanksgiving turkey before you cook it.  Keep everything pinned shut.  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  Let's go to Mike.  Hey, Mike.  What's going on?  Mike.  Yeah, what's up, guys? 
[02:45:00]  You're on the radio.  Hey, man.  I was just telling you before, and I called in, you know, you go into the bathrooms with your kid and stuff,  and they got them short for those balls, and you sit there and you tell your kid, well, that's for kids.  That's what the Jamaican guys make.  Oh, the urinals that go right to the floor?  That's what the Jamaican guys make.  Hey, you guys are great, man.  Thank you, Mike.  All right, Jake.  Look at what you started today, Jamaican Mike.  That's good.  That's good, man.  It's all good, right?  Yeah.  Oh, no, no, Liz. 
[02:45:30]  Hello.  You say that a lot so they don't bring you up on charges, man.  Who are you kidding?  Liz.  Yes.  Hey.  Hey.  All right, I have a question.  I'm going through a little bit of a divorce.  My girlfriend just broke up with her man after four years, so we said, girl, we're going to go book a trip.  We booked a trip to hedonism.  What kind of adventures are we in for?  Getting a little scared of all these little stories here.  Oh, so you're going?  Here we're going June 28th, hedonism three.  Now, who are you going with? 
[02:46:00]  With one of my girlfriends.  Ah.  Yeah.  How about that?  Do you have a boyfriend in here?  No.  No.  Okay.  Well, then just go and get some rope.  I was thinking, like, we were kind of nervous because, well, we heard these horrible stories  about hedonism and all it is is sex and drugs, blah, blah, blah.  And I think we're going to have an arm lane full of fun.  Yeah, you're going to have a lot of fun.  Ah, yeah.  Don't be scared.  It's okay.  Well, let's connect her with Tony, who thinks hedonism in Jamaica is great.  Tony.  Yeah, what's going on? 
[02:46:30]  Hey.  Liz is on the line with you.  She needs some advice.  She's going down to hedonism.  Hey, Tony.  Hi, Liz.  How are you?  Good.  You've been there?  Yeah, I was there in August, and it was absolutely fabulous.  I mean, everyone is just so naked.  I mean, you know, I walked on the beach and you just saw the junk flying everywhere.  You're going to have a good time.  That's for damn sure.  And it was pretty interesting.  You know when you get your room key when you go away?  Uh-huh.  What the guys did was they took the room key and they tied it around their junk in the  little sack underneath. 
[02:47:00]  And they looked like real tools walking around.  Oh, my God.  But when you go there, you've got to go to the party.  They have, like, a team party.  Uh-huh.  You've got to go to, like, a costume party.  People go, like, you know, you go out.  You go to bed.  Right.  Everyone just goes naked.  It's just wild.  Oh, man.  Hey, guys, you've got to see.  When you go there, like, 60 bucks, you've got a size of gondas that's the size of your  arm.  Unbelievable.  Un-freaking-believable.  What are you guys doing?  I should pack light then, huh?  Oh, real light.  Just go out.  You go to bed.  Go nude.  Get on the plane naked. 
[02:47:30]  Bring plenty of anal ease.  Do you think that I'm not going to have to come back, then, if they're so good down  there?  Oh, definitely not.  You can get anything you want down there.  You're definitely not going to want to come back.  I can't wait to go back.  All right.  Come down with us.  I was eating this in two when I went.  Oh, look at that.  She wants you to come down.  Come down with us.  Oh, I might have to.  All right.  What are you saying?  Eating this in three?  Yes, we are.  All right.  When are you going?  June 28th.  Look at this.  Love connection.  Let's just wear, like, a wow shirt or something.  I paint it on my body.  I can't wear a shirt.  I've got to paint it on. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, there you go.  There you go.  Hey, they have that, too.  They have naked twister poolside every day at 4 o'clock.  Jeez, man.  Absolutely fabulous.  Oh, my God.  Everything's just jumping around.  Guys, girls, it don't matter.  Stuff's everywhere.  All right, man.  All right, guys.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  Thanks, Liz.  Thanks, Tony.  All right.  There they go.  Let's go to John.  John, you're next on N.E.W.  Yeah, I was down in Jamaica with my girl a couple months ago, and I was drinking one night.  Could have performed in bed. 
[02:48:30]  Big black, I've reached down the door from Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Oh, that movie.  I want to show my girls the love.  Black, make mom look.  That's from Kentucky Fried Movie, John.  Thank you.  Your syndication went into it.  Very funny.  That old guy.  Hey, man.  Hey, Rod.  Yeah, guys.  What's happening?  How are you?  All right.  I'm doing good.  Hey, let me tell you something.  I was taking my girl down to Florida a couple weeks, and I figured...  Give her a little special drive to go over to Jamaica. 
[02:49:00]  So I was going to go get the ticket this weekend.  Let me tell you something.  I got one thing to say to you, Tracy, because I know you're listening.  Disneyland.  We're going to Disneyland.  You are not getting unleashed to the land of the Caribbean Cyclops.  So shocked.  There you go.  That's not happening.  Orlando, man.  That's it.  You are staying confidential, baby.  I still love you, but, you know, we just got to make sure we keep holding what we got.  No, this will be kind of fun, man.  Don't be kidding.  All right, Rod.  All right, guys. 
[02:49:30]  You're good.  All right, guys.  The closest she's going to get is Pirates of the Caribbean.  Disneyland.  Disneyland.  And unlike Disney, it's not a small world.  It's a major, man.  Wendy.  Wendy.  Wendy.  Wendy.  You're talking to me?  Yeah, the Jamaican woman.  Yeah.  No, this is Jennifer.  No, it's Wendy.  No, no, no.  It's Jennifer.  No, no, no.  It's Wendy.  Your name is Wendy. 
[02:50:00]  Okay, Wendy, then.  I guess you just started listening to our show.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Let me fill you in.  All right?  You just started listening to the show.  The name that you said does not exist on this radio show.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I've been listening to the show for quite some time.  I love it.  Oh, good.  All right.  So, Wendy, what do you have today?  Well, I think that all this talk about the long thing,  That's not true.  Jamaican men are no different from any other type of men.  Are you a Jamaican woman?  Yeah.  Well.  Well, I just met.  Wendy's because they're used to it. 
[02:50:30]  That's why you say that.  Let me tell you something.  No, you know why?  You haven't probably had the big Jamaican guys  because they like the American white women that fly down there.  So, you've had the Jamaican guys that can't get the white chicks  because they've got the small ones.  I don't think that's true.  I grew up there.  I don't think that's true.  You know, the small ones.  I'll be eight inches.  You guys are crazy.  You are so crazy.  That's so not true.  That's a myth.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You're just feeding the myth.  All right.  Anyway, take it easy.  Love you, too.  Thank you. 
[02:51:00]  All right.  I've got to thank Rick today.  During the whole show,  he's just putting different pictures of Anna Kornikova up on the screen.  I'm looking over there.  I've seen about a thousand pictures so far.  That's someone.  Yeah, a lot of new ones.  Where does she wear that?  Like, she's going to play tennis  and she's wearing something like that you would wear on the beach.  I bet they'd like her down in Jamaica, huh?  She'd grab that thing like she was doing a backhand. 
[02:51:30]  Two hands, man.  You know a two-handed backhand?  Yes!  Alan!  How you doing?  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  All right.  Alan, what's up?  You're a frequent listener, first-time caller.  All right.  Thanks.  I used to hear you guys on VAB.  I was the guy in the Shell station.  Wow.  That's a long time ago.  Of course.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:52:00]  The show still rules, man.  I was just wondering if they had condoms for these guys.  And who makes them?  Hefty.  Well, I would assume so.  You know, I had a really great time.  Go Friday!  Go Friday, man.  It's a really, really cool time listening to the show,  and I hope to be calling again sometime.  Thank you, Alan.  Really awesome.  Okay, guys?  Keep it up.  All right, man.  Take it easy.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  I think we've got enough on this topic today, huh?  Ronnie?  Yeah.  Hey, guys. 
[02:52:30]  What's going on?  Hey.  I love the show.  However, I think I've had enough visuals of black men's penis in the last year I like them.  I mean, my fun and key of coming home is listening to erotic, disgusting stories of lovely women.  Enough of the black guys.  Enough.  Well, we've had a discussion about how the women, when they go to Jamaica, you know, react when...  You want to know something funny?  As far as a guy's point of view, have you ever seen the Jamaican women? 
[02:53:00]  No.  It's nothing to boast about, brother.  I haven't been down there, so I don't know.  It's nothing to boast about.  What up?  And you get any?  What?  Did you get any?  No.  Not at all.  All right.  Well, thank you, Ryan.  No case, man.  Okay, guys.  Adios.  Adios.  How can we white people play naked twister when the special Jamaican dial lands on foot-long schlong on blue?  Mark in Jersey. 
[02:53:30]  On the beach, you see two footprints with a groove down the middle.  Looks like a Komodo dragon's been walking down the beach.  No, that's next time.  Oh, yeah.  Whoa.  Sextra and tile.  Man.  Okay, horrific.  Okay, horrific.  What's up, man?  Oh, dear.  What up, man? 
[02:54:00]  What's up?  What's up, man?  My Jamaican mark, man.  Hey, what, more, dear?  What's it for you like?  Everything all right, man.  Oh, dear.  Everything's all right, man.  Yeah.  All right, yeah.  Oh, dear.  Anthony?  Opie?  Yeah.  So long as I'm not long enough for you.  Keep out of this conversation.  Step to the side.  Step to the side.  What are you talking about?  Hey, hey, Dominican men, we also have a reputation for having a good-sized unit, B. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, please.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  Did you see?  It's all in the C-A-N, Dominican, Jamaican, because we can't get the job done, you know?  Give, man.  Yo, syndication when white men had big enough slots to try to try their women.  Hey, old dirty.  What's up?  Real fast.  Did you see the A-bomb on TV last night?  Oh, my.  Yo, you have to see.  Me and my brother had, like, the whole house. 
[02:55:00]  And we had, like, two TVs.  Yeah.  I'm like, Channel 4, and he's like, Channel 4.  It was like a control room in here.  And, yo, like, all of a sudden, he just started creeping up.  And when I read it, I said, holy ass, man.  Yeah, a ton of people have stories about the A-bomb.  He's outrageous, kid.  Yeah.  Yo, Mike.  Hey.  Mike, Mike, it's going to be three times.  All right, old D. All right?  All right, baby.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right. 
[02:55:30]  Going to Jamaica is like going into the hole in the Shawshank Redemption.  Chicks go in, and after they leave, they're never the same.  It's a show from Jersey.  Very good.  The hands up as big as the hole behind the poster.  He crawled at them.  Danielle.  No, it's Daniel.  Oh, Daniel.  What's up?  Yeah.  I learned that Anthony's wife actually went down to Jamaica.  That's why she's leaving him. 
[02:56:00]  Like you guys have said, once you see it, you never go back.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, bud.  Berger's checking in, in defense, from what old Dirty said, American, you dumb app.  Hey, what happened with that Ileon ruling?  He's going to stay in, he's going to stay.  I see that on the news right now.  Let me see.  Ileon to stay in the U.S. for at least three more weeks.  Blah, blah, blah.  That's the latest on that. 
[02:56:30]  Patrick Swayze survives plane crash.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he was flying some twin-engine Cessna and kind of crashed it on a dirt road and just  started walking away.  Boy, tough guy.  They kind of found him down the road.  Fine.  Trying to jumpstart his career and film Ghosts, too.  I think, you know something, that sounds like, you know, hey, if I crash a plane, I'll get  some press.  Right.  And I think it's time to play What Did We Learn on the ONA Show today. 
[02:57:00]  I think we had quite the educational program today.  Yeah.  Between certain ways to fix a dents and scratches on vehicles, to sending your girl to Jamaica  and what she can expect, Anna Kornikova, Gary Glitter, or Larry Brillante.  There's just been so many things today.  Yeah.  The A-bomb.  Oh, all right.  Oh, my God, Tommy from Parallon, you're a sick bastard. 
[02:57:30]  I learned today that if I let my woman go to Jamaica, I'm going to see the Grand Canyon.  Yeah.  Yodeling.  A little early, what did I learn today?  I learned never to get into a Jamaican prison.  Insert butt sack soundbite here.  I learned that a spaz is an auto-body MacGyver, and air Jamaican planes are painted brown 
[02:58:00]  with veins on them.  All right, we'll take a break.  Not brown.  Black.  We'll go right to the phones next.  You guys are on fire today.  We'll keep that going.  We'll be back.  Pulse me and after me.  Stupid.  We had guys lifting stuff with their units.  Oh, yes.  Excuse me, taking a big boot. 
[02:58:30]  Tasteless.  Scotty, you've got to get our protective membrane vaginal seal back up.  I thought I'm a fancy son.  Hey!  Hey, that is the rest of the jungle.  Yes.  Hey.  We had guys come in that enjoy getting kicked in the nags.  Ignore it.  You really don't know where the, uh, can't I go?  That's a good guy.  Ivory has reloaded.  Oh, that one.  Yeah.  Just over eight feet. 
[02:59:00]  O-V-E-N-A.  Dopey ass show.  W-N-E-W.  Dopey ass show.  Who could forget Ivory and the eggs?  Yeah.  That was a great one.  Another brilliant moment in Opie and Anthony's radio history.  Great moment in sports.  Yes, it was.  It's the most interactive radio show in America, Anthony.  Our listeners are a huge part of this radio show.  I want to thank Jermaine and Mike for stopping by today. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  He jump-started this damn show today.  I'll be honest.  After that A-bomb thing yesterday, I packed my bags.  I was like, I didn't prepare for today.  I usually read four or five newspapers, magazines, the works.  I had no clue what was going on when it came to work today.  I'm like, there's no way we're going, we're going to be on the radio today.  There's no way.  We for sure thought they were going to pull the plug at least for a couple of days.  And to our surprise, they did not.  And we had to, like, pull something out of our you-know-what. 
[03:00:00]  So, hey, Jamaican Mike from downstairs, come on up.  It was a fun show, I've got to say.  All right, and it's time to play What Did We Learn on the O&A Show today.  212-757-1027.  Lots of great instant feedback coming in.  Matt from Jersey.  What I learned, having sex with a Jamaican guy is like doing the goalpost at Giant Stadium.  Uh, effin' moron checking in from Jersey.  I like when you guys use, like, nicknames and stuff.  Much better than Tom from Jersey.  Yeah.  Uh, today I learned, uh, body work can be done with a paintbrush, roll of tape, and a hardware store paint. 
[03:00:30]  Fitz from Staten Island.  Well, I learned I'm not making the Jamaican mistake-er.  When my girlfriend goes on vacation, the bitch is going to Williamsburg, Virginia.  She can whoop it up watching a reenactment of the Revolutionary War.  I think we just ruined tourism for, uh, Jamaica.  I don't know.  I don't know.  There's going to be a bunch of people running down there.  Law from Jersey.  I learned that a Jamaican's junk causes more damage than an A-bomb. 
[03:01:00]  Joe from Jersey.  I learned there are six more words I haven't seen on TV.  Yeah, six to go, Anthony.

A lot of people, oh boy, they're on that Jamaica thing, huh?  I'm trying to get someone that has something else, but let's see what Matt has.  Matt!  Hey, Matt.  Yeah.  What did you learn today?  All right. 
[03:08:00]  Today I learned maybe with a little duct tape and a little paint, maybe we could fix guys'  brain?  Did that work, baby?

It cannot happen.  Yeah.  It cannot happen.  Yeah.  Thank you, Matt.  Good night.  Hey, where's Spaz?  We've got to see what his week in review is going to be all about tomorrow.  Ah, a little preview, man.  We'll get the preview of Spaz's week in review on Thursday. 
[03:08:30]  Get Spaz.  Spaz, you ignorant fool, get in here.  Spaz?  Tomorrow's your big day.  Spaz's week in review.  Appreciate you.  What do we look forward to?  I really can't tell you off the top of my head.  I've been doing a lot this week, and to have it on top of my head is just I can't.  So basically you haven't even prepared yet.  I have prepared.  Give me one story. 
[03:09:00]  One subject.  One subject, one story.  I can't remember.  You can't remember.  You can't remember.  This is your big, you do one on-air thing a week that you plan for this show, and you  can't remember one subject?  No, I haven't written down that.  Driving Habits of the Retardant.  Auto repair techniques.  Yeah, auto repair techniques.  Okay.  Okay.  They gave me these tools when I graduated.  All right, where is it written down? 
[03:09:30]  It's at home.  Oh, my God.  It sounds like, you know, all of a sudden I feel like the teachers that I used to go to  their class.  All right.  It's at home.  I just busted them, though.  Yeah.  Listen to the nice question.  Aren't you supposed to take the week in review Thursday nights?  I take the Friday mornings, then.  You can't remember one thing that happened in the news.  No, it's been a lot. 
[03:10:00]  Okay, so it should be easy.  I can't remember.  One thing from the week in review.  You're fast.  Fast up.  I'm not.  You have no list of things.  If the list is not wrong, I swear.  I did not wrong.  Opie, what do you think?  Come to my house tonight.  It's written right there.  One thing?  Come to my house.  Yeah, I'm going to hop on the train for three hours to go to Slokesburg to look at a list  that isn't there.  It's a week in review.  You just quickly go in your head.  All right, what happened in the news this week that I'm going to riff on?  I don't remember. 
[03:10:30]  So you're talking about the release of Mission Impossible?  Good.  Good.  Yeah, that's okay.  So you're talking about Rick Lazio falling down and getting a poofy lip?  So that was your top story, so I believe it's Kobe in there.  I believe it's probable.  If you wrote it down on a list, you would remember.  I'm not lying.  You are totally lying right now.  You can go inside my house first, and I'll tell you where the book is.  I'll go, no, come to my house.  I swear to God.  I'll tell you where the book is when you get there.  And you can go way ahead of me. 
[03:11:00]  When did you write it down?  How am I lying?  When did you write it?  When did you write it?  I wrote it last night.  And you don't remember?  No.  Not one thing you wrote.  Oh, I have a short to remember.  What do you mean?  Do you write it in your head?  No, but it's that short.  Oh, man.  You're totally lying.  I'm not lying.  How am I lying if I can prove it to you?  You can prove it to us by saying what you wrote down last night.  Now the listeners are writing on the screen that they're not going to listen tomorrow. 
[03:11:30]  Because you're not prepared.  I am prepared.  Tom, I'm not going to listen tomorrow to Spaz.  Come to my house.  You can go ahead and hand me.  Spaz is retarded.  Thank you, Spanky.  Line 7.  Spaz is an idiot.  Spaz is a lunatic.  Anything about the shooting at Wendy's?  I don't remember.  How do you not remember what you wrote down last night?  It was a tough story from there.  I'm not lying.  What about the game?  That guy's nothing to do with the news.  Yeah, it's part of the news.  I'm not lying. 
[03:12:00]  I fucking shit.  Are you going to talk about the A-bomb?  It's coming to my house.  Are you going to talk about the A-bomb?  I'm going to go ahead of me.  I'll tell you where the book is.  I'm not lying.  Come to my house then.  Then why don't you call me on it?  Call me on it and come to my house.  Call me on it and come to my house.  Who's going to go to Slotesburg?  Who's going to go to Slotesburg to see if you are the piece of paper?  If we left at 7, okay, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1 in the morning, we'd get home.  Okay, but fine, if you don't want to, I can prove it to you.  I can prove it to you, but you're not going to call me on it. 
[03:12:30]  So then don't say anything because I'm just...  Don't start getting defensive, man, because you don't...  You have to call me on it and you're not taking the shot.  You know something?  No, we're not.  We're not coming to my house to show you that it's written down in the book in my repentance.  You ain't effing sane.  I'm not lying.  Come to my house.  I'll show it to you.  I can tell you what I wrote down a year ago.  I thought...  I'm just going ahead of me and I'll tell you the book in the book in the book right there.  Call you on it.  Call me on it.  He talks like he's calling us and we're not fessing up.  No, you're not fessing.  Make sure you get this straight.  We're not the ones that aren't fessing up by coming to your house. 
[03:13:00]  You're not fessing up by not knowing what you wrote last night.  I don't remember.  We'll call you on it.  You can stay in the city tonight.  Have Erica bring the list and show it to us first.  Okay, well, I've got to get permission to stay in the city first.  Oh, my God.  He doesn't have any money left out of his car.  He can stay in the car.  All right, whatever.  Okay.  Liar, liar, pants on fire.  Liar, liar, pants on fire. 
[03:13:30]  Perfect example why I love that kid, man.  Did you see him just totally, like, getting defensive?  And then, like, calling us out.  Like, you won't come to my house?  See?  Now you aren't coming.  No, I'm not going to Sloatesburg.  You don't have the God damn list.  You don't have the children's room with me.  All right, we've got to get out of here.  Jamaican Mike, thank you so much for saving our show today.  Very good.  Big it up, big it up.  Big it up, big it up.  Can we get, like, Puerto Rican Steve from the garage for tomorrow's show? 
[03:14:00]  We might need him.  Or Habib Bill.  I mean, it's like...  Any of the other guys want to come on up tomorrow?  I swear to God, as you watch the cars being parked down there, it's like it's a small world, isn't it?  Right.  Down there with a different nationality, just driving around.  It's amazing.  They love it.  I made one of the brothers laugh when I used to drive into the city.  It was Anthony, I was with Ant, when we were still driving together.  I go, yo, Ant, you got some cheddar? 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, that was very funny.  And I tip the guy, I go, yo, you got some cheddar?  And the brother just starts laughing.  Like you were from Mars.  He starts laughing so hard.  Cheddar.  We walk behind cheddar.  Hey, would you throw at me a roll of people?  That's my list.  All right, we've got to get out of here.  Tomorrow's FU Friday.  Molly Shore coming in tomorrow?  Oh, my God, really?  And I think Adam's coming in tomorrow.  Adam Ferrari.  Adam Ferrari. 
[03:15:00]  My pal.  And we might do Stoner Spilling Bee tomorrow.  Cool.  He said, doing that stupid Spilling Bee on ESPN, I saw that all day.  Yeah, that was action-packed on ESPN.  Since when is that supposed to be on ESPN?  I don't know.  They're running out of sports, I guess.  All right, we'll talk to you guys tomorrow.  Blar.  Down to Mike next.  O.P. Anthony.  We hate each other.  The guy's insane.  He's certifiably insane.  Thank you, Anthony.  Shut up, you jackass.  O.P. and Anthony.  Too ignorant jackasses if someone was brain-dead enough to give a radio show soon.
