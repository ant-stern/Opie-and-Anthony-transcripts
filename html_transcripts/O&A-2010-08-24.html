<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts preemptively apologizing for the inevitable controversy to follow, self-deprecatingly referencing past scandals.  The initial topics included the Tiger Woods divorce, focusing on speculation about his lawyer's competence and Elin Nordegren's motivations, and the planned mosque near Ground Zero.  The hosts expressed strong disapproval of the mosque's location, citing insensitivity and criticizing the Imam's past statements, playing audio clips of his controversial remarks about American involvement in Muslim deaths.  They also discussed the reactions of public figures like Michael Bloomberg and Rosie O'Donnell. This sparked a heated debate with callers, including a particularly contentious exchange with a caller named Stryker, marked by inflammatory accusations and insults from both sides.  The segment also included a humorous interlude featuring a video of a man enthusiastically splashing people with water from his car. The hosts also shared anecdotes about their own experiences with cocaine use, transitioning into a discussion about the rising cost of MetroCards and the financial struggles of New Yorkers, highlighted by a caller’s lament about high New Jersey Transit costs.  The conversation returned to Tiger Woods’ divorce, including detailed speculation about the financial settlement and Elin Nordegren's post-divorce life, and the hosts shared their opinions on the unfairness of divorce settlements favoring women. This discussion included anecdotes about various mistresses and one caller's own divorce.  The segment concluded with commentary on "The Situation" from the Jersey Shore, his sudden wealth, and speculation about drug use among the cast, particularly Ronnie, along with a brief discussion about Facebook, John Madden, A-Rod, and a mention of Robert Kelly as an upcoming guest.


The following segment heavily featured "The Situation," analyzing his surprising success and brand building, focusing on his catchphrases, physique, and deliberate brand management.  The hosts contrasted his popularity with that of other Jersey Shore cast members (Snooki, JWoww, Ronnie) and invented a fictional vodka brand, "Brother Man, Brother Man Vodka,"  developing humorous (and offensive) marketing ideas. The conversation then abruptly shifted to a caller’s detailed description of gill net fishing, including descriptions of the process, the types of fish caught (monkfish, dogfish), and the overall experience, interspersed with the hosts' humorous and often offensive commentary.  The segment concluded with a discussion and extensive quoting of a scene from "Pulp Fiction," focusing on Christopher Walken's performance.


A subsequent segment opened with a discussion about Abby and Brittany Hensel, conjoined twins, featuring crude and racist jokes involving Sicilian ancestry.  The segment included numerous video clips showcasing the twins' daily lives, and the hosts, along with a possibly in-studio guest, Jimmy, delivered a barrage of offensive jokes and comments about the twins’ physical appearance, sexual lives, and bodily functions throughout. Listener calls added to the sexually explicit and offensive nature of the discussion.  The conversation veered off into unrelated tangents, including a discussion about a movie scene and Gary Oldman’s acting, and a brief mention of an upcoming UFC fight.


The show continued with a discussion of a medical visit involving the Hensel twins, focusing on graphic and crude jokes about their anatomy and potential for motherhood.  The hosts' comments included speculation about the twins' future and family dynamics,  and mocked a female doctor's appearance.  The segment featured Robert Kelly as an in-studio guest, promoting his appearances at the Stress Factory.  Other topics included a comedic discussion of a massive traffic jam in China, speculation on drivers' activities, and a reaction to a video of a teenager's high-speed car crash, described with graphic language. The segment included listener calls, some humorous and inappropriate, resulting in one heated exchange and an angry outburst from Opie. The segment ended with further promotion of Kelly's shows and more crude jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We'll see you and Anthony are no strangers to this channel.  We'll see you and Anthony on satellite radio.  Both hosts, Anthony Kamiya and Greg Opie.  The controversial team.  We and Anthony are apologizing for yet another apology.  A common profanity with rap.  Is this the last straw for the walking radio duo?  Our show is stupid.  This is so irresponsible.  This should be illegal.  It really should be.  It's like, it's so unethical.  God, I hate fucking radio.  This could be the worst audio ever. 
[00:00:30]  Shut up.  Shut your fucking mouth.  This is terrible.  We just suck all around.  I hope you show restraint in fucking my girlfriend.  This stinks.  Fucking shut the fuck up.  We get it.  We get it.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Wah, wah.  Wonder how many times we've heard this song.  Fuck.  Way too many. 
[00:01:00]  Way too fucking many.  Wah, wah.  Yeah.  Good morning.  Good morning.  On this find two for Tuesday.  It's two for Tuesday.  Two subjects.  Yeah, we'll do two subjects.  Double subjects today.  Oh, wow.  That is two for Tuesday.  So, like, we got Tiger Woods and the divorce thing.  We got to find another divorce story.  Who else?  They're building a mosque at Ground Zero.  We got to find another mosque building story. 
[00:01:30]  That's hard to come by.  They're not building one in Pennsylvania, are they?  Or Washington.  That would suck.  There's Jimmy.  There's Jimmy.  Morning, Jimmy.  Me, me.  You know why I'm late?  Because the kook is coming today.  And our housekeeper.  So I know she's going to...  I'm afraid she's going to wash my dry clean stuff.  So I just split my laundry before I left.  Because I know I'm going to come home and have a bunch of shrunk shirts.  Are you kidding me?  No, but I remember that she's invasive. 
[00:02:00]  And I'm like, I've got to remember not to have dry clean shit.  You're not going to be able to keep your cleaning lady.  For the people that don't know, I have a cleaning lady that mysteriously went to Mexico  under suspicious circumstances.  And she offered up a woman that didn't speak English.  And I learned something about what's going on out there.  What happens is the, well, the illegals, let's just say.  I don't even know if mine was illegal.  But she definitely brought an illegal into the situation.  So they established themselves in a job. 
[00:02:30]  I got this from someone that really knows.  So that's all I'll say.  They established themselves in a job.  In my case, the cleaning lady was there for about a year.  And all of a sudden, she's like, oh, I've got to leave.  I've got a sick mom in Mexico.  I'm leaving my family behind to take care of my sick mom in Mexico.  And then we try to ask her questions about it.  You know, because we got a little relationship with the lady.  And she really didn't want to answer any questions.  Next thing you know...  Sick mom, shut up.  On her last day, she brings another Mexican that barely speaks English. 
[00:03:00]  And goes, but blah, blah, we'll take over my job here.  I could vouch for her.  And you guys won't miss any cleaning service.  So we're, like, really suspicious.  So I'm not going to have anyone in my house without references.  So I'm like, yeah, no problem.  But, you know, we're going to need some references.  And my cleaning lady at the time laughs, like, you don't need references.  I'm vouching for her.  And she's just staring at me, the new lady, like, doesn't even know what's going on because 
[00:03:30]  she doesn't speak English.  Don't know her.  Don't vouch for her.  And I hear this is what happens.  They establish.  They move on to another job to establish.  They bring a new person in, and they get a little kickback.  Get out of here.  They get a little cash for not even cleaning her apartment anymore.  It's a little business they build up.  So she never went back to Mexico, you think?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  But we're thinking that she had nothing going on in Mexico.  Wow.  Because I asked a few people, and someone in the know says, this is exactly what happens.  It's like Mexican Amway. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like a pyramid scheme.  Pyramid scheme.  So now she moves on to another job and gets whatever, a nice salary.  And then she takes a little piece from this lady who desperately needs a gig because she's  new in the country.  And she may have four or five other apartments that she's done that with.  And imagine she gets $10, $20 a week off each apartment.  It starts adding up after a while, right?  Because you get a little taste.  Especially from us because we actually pay people very, very well.  Very well. 
[00:04:30]  I like the lady that you sent, though, even though she's OCD, but I like her.  Hold on.  A Asian woman.  Yeah.  To get you to today because no offense, but a lot of these people can't follow this shit.  So you got to spoon feed them.  So then I got a new lady.  Did we say her name on the air?  Probably shouldn't, I guess.  But a new lady who's an OCD insane cleaning freak.  And Jimmy out of nowhere asked me if I have a cleaning lady.  I'm like, yeah, I got a new one.  I can't vouch for her.  She's only cleaned my apartment three or four times.  And that's where we are today with Jimmy panicking because this OCD cleaning lady is 
[00:05:00]  going to be in your apartment today.  Well, I'm not there.  Yeah.  I should have.  But I think she's fine.  The problem is that she thinks she knows better and is going to rearrange your entire  place while you're here doing the radio show.  She knows not to touch my stuff.  She started moving my signed boxing gloves and putting them on.  And I literally almost cut her hands off like a gorilla and fucking gorillas in the mist.  She knew better.  Right.  So no, she said, oh, okay, okay, okay. 
[00:05:30]  You know, she wouldn't do it because she speaks English.  So they have to speak English.  When they don't speak English, I have no interest.  Really?  No, because you can't like with little things like, hey, the floor is sticky or can we  do something?  And I'll tell you, man, the less English they speak, the better job they do.  Yeah.  In this circumstance.  Yeah.  Because I don't want to piss off a lot of hardworking people out there.  But, you know, you know, those type of jobs, if they don't speak well, they're, they're  fucking scrubbing a little, a little, a little hard, a little harder, a little harder. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.  It's been my experience over the years.  But she comes in like a fucking tornado and just rearranges the entire apartment.  I don't know if I like her yet.  Yeah, she's right.  She might.  I, I, every week I got to go in search of my stuff.  I should start a new TV show in search of my stuff.  Where did she put it this time?  I've been pretty neat this week though.  My girlfriend leaves stuff around and like, well, she, like last week before she came  home, I'm like this, you're going to want to eat this lady's pussy. 
[00:06:30]  I said that because she cleaned so good.  Yeah.  And she was out of her mind when she came home with how nice it was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like, cause I, I mean, I try to be neat, but I'm not a good cleaner.  But it's hilarious that you're, you had to like, you know, hide some stuff.  She's going to find anything you hide.  No, I put it in the, I put the stuff that's supposed to be in the wash, in the wash and  I have a few dry clean items, but I'm afraid she would wash them and I'd fucking kill her.  She does your laundry too then?  I don't know.  I don't know.  You don't know, but you were just making shit.  I'm fucking, I saw a potential disaster of me wearing shrunk shirts like fucking Oscar  yesterday.  Your jacket. 
[00:07:00]  Your nice frigging suit jacket just tumbling in the dryer.  She should be doing laundry the entire time she's there.  That's the beauty of it too.  So laundry's being done as she's scrubbing.  Oh, I started going and then clean and then, yeah.  Fold a load, get another load in there.  Load.  Lots and lots of loads.  Loads.  So, loads rule.  Wow, damn.  I gotta just say it again, man.  When she goes schizo, I told you I can't vouch for her.  I know she cleans really well.  No, but you're building.  Although I'm liking her more and more every week. 
[00:07:30]  The building recommended her.  So if you're building, if you're building recommended her, she's probably good.  Oh, I told you that.  Now, the building itself?  It's really weird because you have to, like, you put your, I'm known as the building whisperer.  Yes.  And I put my head against the building and it tells me things.  It does tell you things.  It absolutely tells you things.  Oh, see, because I was wondering.  Like, it tells me what women in the building want to sleep with me.  And it says, she's going to say no and resist, but take what's yours.  Right.  It means yes.  Isn't that just called ordering a cleaning service? 
[00:08:00]  Oh, stop it.  What are you talking about?  Like the Merry Maids?  All right.  They're trying to put a mosque in Florida.  That's okay.  Yeah, fuck it.  What happened down there?  People think I'm, people think I don't want mosques built in America.  There was an oil spill.  Stop the mosque.  I go issue to issue and, and, you know, a mosque really close to ground zero bothers me.  It has nothing to do with freedom of religion.  I understand that completely.  But this particular mosque bothers me that it's two weeks, two blocks from fucking ground 
[00:08:30]  zero.  Yeah.  Although I don't care if they build them anywhere else.  I really don't build one right next to my fucking building.  I don't even care.  I don't care.  They do have a lot of flight schools down there, though.  What?  Florida.  All right.  Some church, some church is doing some Koran burning.  It's like, what are you doing?  It's like, it's not about the fucking, nothing better than a good old fashioned book burning.  It's amazing.  It's like, you know, people are missing the point.  People are calling.  Black and white.  Have Goebbels fucking there. 
[00:09:00]  Well, the people that are showing on the news, it's like, it's freedom of religion.  We understand that.  But it's also about tact and fucking, yes, you know, insensitivity that is bothering  a lot of fucking people.  That's all.  That's all.  I had a little discussion last night about the whole freedom of religion and how these  politicians, especially like Bloomberg, especially is coming out and saying, hey, this is a  constitutional right that they have to do this.  And he is one of the most outspoken opponents of what I like, the Second Amendment to our 
[00:09:30]  Constitution and our right to bear arms.  And Bloomberg is the worst when it comes to the Second Amendment.  And that's one of our rights.  It's number two.  And he is completely against that.  Yet he's like just coughing up that drivel about their right to fucking religious freedom  to build a mosque.  And he keeps law-abiding citizens from arming themselves.  You think Bloomberg has armed bodyguards?  Of course he does. 
[00:10:00]  I always get a kick out of that.  Of course.  What, the people that have armed bodyguards and then yell and scream and then no one  should have guns?  Rosie O'Donnell is a prime example.  You probably shouldn't have a vote.  You shouldn't have a vote if you have armed people around you at all times.  Rosie O'Donnell, a prime example.  Which means we don't get a vote.  Outspoken anti-Second Amendment.  Rosie O'Donnell had two bodyguards, both of them armed.  Both of them have a permit to carry.  And she then said something like, well, I'm in the public eye and I have children that 
[00:10:30]  need to be protected.  It's like, well, then who the fuck are you?  Maybe everyone needs to be protected and wants to protect themselves.  Ah, fuck her.  Fat fucking slob.  I really believe you shouldn't get a vote if you've got armed people around you.  So it's a different situation.  Bloomberg is well protected.  Yeah, you don't think that guy to his left and the guy behind him doesn't have heavy artillery  behind him.  We're looking at a picture of Bloomberg from Life Magazine there. 
[00:11:00]  The mayor of New York City is one of the most powerful fucking jobs in politics, right?  Yeah.  Oh, he's okay.  But I don't understand why these people are getting on the news to yell freedom of religion.  I think most people that are smart understand that part of this issue.  Yeah, absolutely.  You know, I mean, and then someone's like, well, how many Moss are in Manhattan right now?  I'm like, I don't care how many.  Yeah.  I don't care.  That's fine.  That's completely fine.  I have no problem with that.  I'm not going to, like, you're not going to get a free pass on building a mosque where 
[00:11:30]  body parts were found and part of the plane went through the roof.  A little too close.  Well, we got imam.  Imam?  The imam.  Yeah, he's saying some very interesting things.  I hate that word.  Thanks.  I can never say that.  I was just going to say, I hate imam.  It's a hard word to say.  You want to say imam or imam?  I'mam.  You want to say imam.  I'mam.  Yes.  But it's imam.  I'mam.  I'mam.  He said this.  And the history of the politics between the West and the Muslim world. 
[00:12:00]  We tend to forget in the West that the United States has more Muslim blood on its hands than  al-Qaeda has on its hands of innocent non-Muslims.  You may remember that the U.S.-led sanction against Iraq led to the death of over a half  half a million Iraqi children. 
[00:12:30]  This has been documented by the United Nations.  That's the guy that is the moderate Muslim that everyone's embracing to help heal and get together the West with the Muslim world.  He's just another fucking cunt Muslim shithead.  Enough of this shit.  Every one of them has that little, but the U.S.  But he actually is saying in that sentence that the U.S. is worse than al-Qaeda. 
[00:13:00]  That's what he's saying right there.  More blood on our hands.  And that's the one that that asshole mayor of ours is lining up with.  God, it's fucking...  Yeah, put him over there.  You don't think he's going to have a little chit-chat with some of his boys when they get in there  about what fucking assholes we are as a country?  Stop it.  That's him.  That's the guy.  That's him.  What complicates the discussion intra-Islamically is the fact that the West has not been cognizant 
[00:13:30]  and has not addressed the issues of its own contribution to much injustice in the Arab and Muslim world.  There you go.  It's a difficult subject to discuss with Western audiences, but it's one that must be pointed out.  The key point is that his soft voice is not fucking lulling me into listening to him.  It's the same shit.  The U.S.  He's saying the West.  The U.S.  Right.  Has not addressed its contribution.  He's going to translate. 
[00:14:00]  The U.S.'s foreign policy brought 9-11 on the U.S.  The U.S. asked for it.  The U.S. got it.  Therefore, Al-Qaeda is pretty much let off the hook because the U.S. has caused more Muslim blood  than it caused United States blood.  That's what he's saying, this fucking twat.  And this is the guy that everyone's embracing as the moderate Muslim.  And by the way, he is a moderate Muslim.  Just talking like that.  He doesn't have a bomb strapped around him, so he's moderate.  It's infuriating that they're kissing this fucking guy's ass. 
[00:14:30]  And Bloomberg, you fucking self-hating Jew, is sitting there looking at this guy and kissing  his fucking terrorist Arab ass.  Ugh.  It's funny.  People always knock the Midwest.  Like, oh, they're dumb in the Midwest.  And they're dumb in the South.  But you know what?  About something like this, they're more honest about how sickened they are by it.  They're not trying to doll it up.  They're just a little bit more honest in their language.  Yeah.  Yep.  Let's kiss each other.  Let's please.  Well.  We can't stand this imam. 
[00:15:00]  This issue is, like, all over the place every fucking day now, man.  It is building and building and building.  And I can't get enough that his wife's name is Khan.  I know, Daisy Khan.  Oh, Captain, they put the bombs in our buildings.  God.  Let's say hi to Bobby in Providence, Rhode Island.  But you keep missing the target, God.  Bobby.  How you doing?  Hi.  Hello.  Jimmy, let me ask you a quick question. 
[00:15:30]  Sure.  We're talking about, you know, Saman and he's saying that half a million Iraqi kids, whatever.  What would happen if the Iraqis or the Russians came over here and started fucking with us?  I'll tell you.  Hold on.  That was a quick question.  Red Dawn, my friend.  Red Dawn.  He was saying.  Dude, he was saying that the U.S.-led sanctions caused the death, meaning that the sanctions against Iraq, which I'm guessing were over the weapons of mass destruction inspections, are what caused the death. 
[00:16:00]  That's what I'm assuming he's saying.  So basically he's saying that Saddam Hussein or the Iraqi government took an action.  The U.S. led the sanctions, and that caused starvation.  Not the fact that Saddam was taking money that could have fed those children and filtering it to his military and stealing it for himself.  Exactly.  He was blaming us for Saddam stealing that money from those children.  Look at the palaces.  Our politicians don't do that ourselves, right?  We still throw our money into the military, yet there's plenty of kids starving.  There's plenty of people dying on the streets of America, but we don't give a shit about that, do we? 
[00:16:30]  But we're not blaming other countries.  You're asking me what I would do.  And I'm saying what he's saying is that the U.S. caused those children to starve because of the sanctions, instead of saying that Saddam Hussein's actions caused the U.S. and other countries to levy sanctions against them.  And he's the one that decided not to feed the children.  Right, but you just said Saddam Hussein filtered money from his own country.  Or just took it.  He just basically took it.  The extension of my question now is, what if another country came in and did shit to us? 
[00:17:00]  What would you do?  What do you mean if they came and did shit to us, like when Japan did?  I think the U.S. answered.  When Al-Qaeda did and Afghanistan gave them cover, I think we said we wanted to do it as a country.  And I'm for that.  What I would do is I would like the military to strike back when it's justified.  What Anthony just said, Wolverines.  That was a great movie.  Okay, Red Dawn.  I think they're remaking it with an entire black cast.  We should make a movie now with Red Dawn in 2010. 
[00:17:30]  Think about that.  I think they are making a remake of Red Dawn, aren't they?  I think that's in the works.  I've talked to my kids.  You know, they see the things that are going on.  They're scared about it.  All right, thank you, brother.  Brian in Jersey.  Brian!  What's up, Brian?  Just a quick point.  There is a large Muslim community downtown in downtown New York to warrant such a place of worship.  It's only a fuck you to America.  Hey, it's not a place of worship only, my friend. 
[00:18:00]  It is a community center for everybody to go there and learn.  Learn about the Muslim world.  Learn how you strap a fucking bomb onto your body.  Or plot to fucking...  Learn how to plot against the U.S. in secrecy.  Or just learn about the sins of the U.S.  Of course.  Even without the violence, just learn about the sins of the U.S.  And how awful the U.S. is.  And how U.S.-led foreign policy kills Muslims.  And Muslims don't kill Muslims.  That's those American soldiers strapping bombs to them and running into mosques. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Who's running into the mosques and hacking each other apart?  You don't think they're going to have an open mind?  Oh.  At the center?  Dude.  I don't think I see that.  That's right, though.  This guy is a moderate.  Like, this is a moderate Muslim.  There's never one...  This is why...  So this guy kind of has an open mind?  Yeah.  He's supposed to have an open mind?  And even this guy cannot stop saying how we're responsible...  For spilling Muslim blood.  And it's our fault that they hate us. 
[00:19:00]  Not that their religious fanaticism causes them to hate people.  And that wherever there are Muslims in the world, there's violence.  He's loving the position he's in, huh?  And you don't think when he's in there preaching his fucking drivel that he's going to have  a few things to say when they're all just Muslims in front of him?  You don't think he's going to be yapping about how fucking awful the U.S. is?  The West.  Excuse me.  The West.  Who's left in the West?  We're the West.  Shut up.  Latin America?  Yeah.  Let's go to Trucker Dan. 
[00:19:30]  Trucker Dan.  Hey, good morning, my fellow Americans.  Good morning, Trucker Dan.  Hey, all these pacifist assholes calling in need to start...  They're doing their research.  Pacifist.  This is water guy.  Water!  Yeah.  Water.  What's up?  Got momegranate lemonade this morning.  I hear they put stuff in our food to make us pacifists.  Yeah, really.  Hey, man, seriously, if you did research on this, this imam is... 
[00:20:00]  The Cordoba house is an actual exact replica of the one in Spain, and that one in Spain burnt  down, not only burnt down a Christian church and put up the Cordoba mosque in its place  as a sign of victory, they killed every Christian in the second town.  The Cordoba.  Yeah, that's what this is about.  It's about a victory, and you know these conversations between these mosques.  All the seats in the mosque are made of rich Corinthian leather. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, by the way, it's funny.  When Opie played that audio, I had not looked at the post yet, and I just opened it up,  and it said, U.S. worse than Al-Qaeda.  That's a five-year-old speech that you played.  So he's getting killed for that now.  That's bad.  Oh, this isn't a new...  Dude, no.  That's five years old.  It was dug up.  He's not happy that it was dug up.  No.  But you think that matters five years?  It was after 9-11. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, yeah.  So, you know, he's not being very sympathetic.  2005.  But I'm saying that's getting a fucking...  No, that's getting him a tremendous amount of bad press.  I think the opposition...  Oh, God.  Imagine the conversations he's having behind the scenes without the press around.  You know he's going, oh, help me build this mosque in victory.  If he's saying these things in front of the press, you can only imagine in a mosque behind the scenes what he's saying.  Yeah, behind the scenes, you've got to imagine he's a hero to get this done. 
[00:21:30]  I mean, this would make a lot of Muslims very, very happy, I would assume.  Oh, yes.  All right, Chuck and Dan.  He made that speech in Australia, by the way.  Oh, really?  Yes, that was in Australia.  That's a dangerous place, that Australia.  Watch out for that.  A lot of Muslims down there?  I don't know, actually.  Let's say hi to Scott in Tampa.  Everyone's talking about this mosque thing.  Scott.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hello.  By the way, Jimmy, you killed in Tampa.  Thank you.  Oh, thank you.  I love Tampa.  You killed in Cucamonga. 
[00:22:00]  I read last week that this imam guy is being supported by the State Department, and I'm almost  positive I read that his trip was being financed.  Oh, yeah, by us.  Yeah, he is.  We paid for his trip to the Middle East to, you know, make a piece so he could go to the  Middle East and talk about how wonderful the United States is, and how we should all get  together, and get rid of this fear of Islam, and meanwhile, he's bad-mouthing the United 
[00:22:30]  States of America.  Stryker.  This guy's a scumbag.  He is a scumbag.  Yeah.  Stryker.  Good morning, boys.  I meant Stryker.  First of all, are you really calling me a pussy?  Oh, shit.  You're not calling me a pussy, right, Stryker?  Oh, shit.  That's a mistake on the fucking phone line, right?  Well, you've hung up on me four days in a row when I've tried to prove that.  I didn't hang up on anyone, sir.  Maybe you stunk. 
[00:23:00]  So let's stop with Opie's a pussy shit, first of all, okay?  Second of all, to give my stance...  Stryker's being reprimanded.  I like seeing both sides of each issue on this fucking radio show, and always have.  So fuck you, Stryker.  Now, what do you got for the show today?  Oh, shit.  I am putting up with bullshit.  Anthony and Jimmy keep making the comment that no mosque is being prohibited from being  built in the United States, and that's factually not true.  In fact, Anthony yesterday made a comment about the article in Time Magazine, which I'm curious, 
[00:23:30]  Anthony, if you actually read the article.  Yes, I did.  The Islamophobic article?  Yeah.  Can you tell me what the first three paragraphs of the article are about?  Off the top of my head?  No.  I can.  What is it about, Jimmy?  I don't want to say.  Oh, okay.  Well, the first three paragraphs are about a mosque in Sheboygan, Wisconsin.  Sheboygan?  In Time Magazine?  Yes.  Yeah, the article, it's about the mosque being built and the anti-Islamic sentiment that 
[00:24:00]  he's felt.  He's a doctor, and he was surprised that he felt such anti-Islamic sentiment, and a lot  of other people are like, well, you shouldn't be surprised, and then it goes on to ground  zero.  And then in that article, of course, they list all the sins of America and our history of  intolerance.  I was just going to say that.  The article doesn't go deep enough in the fact that all over the country, mosques or  Islamic centers, even some that currently exist, are having problems getting permits to either  expand or being built. 
[00:24:30]  In many cases, are owned before 9-11.  There is an anti-Islamic sentiment in this country.  It's gotten a lot worse since 9-11.  You're right.  It's gotten a lot worse in the last 18 months.  In fact, there's a Tea Party group in Semecula, California.  Thank God.  ...from being built.  And the current lieutenant governor of Tennessee has come out and is calling all of Islam a  cult, and he's taking a stance against an existing Islamic center from being expanded. 
[00:25:00]  Too bad.  Too bad.  National security.  Sorry.  National security.  Yeah.  I want to build a Catholic church that's headed by a pedophile priest right next door in  elementary school.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  It's a lot easier for them to keep tabs on the elementary school and make sure the priests  don't fuck the kids than it is to make sure Islamics don't blow up places.  And plot.  And sit there in their mosques. 
[00:25:30]  And plot against this country.  They plot.  They scheme.  I'm curious, Anthony, have you joined the group that's calling for the burning down  of all mosques in the United States?  Burning down the mosques?  Now, that seems a little extreme, to tell you the truth.  No, I wouldn't.  But I'd turn them all into 7-Elevens.  Well, there's a group that got their start in Europe.  They've moved here into the U.S. that condones the killing of Muslims, the running up, deportation 
[00:26:00]  of Muslims even in the U.S.  Yeah, that's their point of view.  You know what happens?  I don't have to worry about me being blown up or fucking burned or deported.  So fuck them.  But, dude, that extremist shit, most people are not saying that.  So what?  There's an extremist group that wants Muslims deported.  That's not most of us.  Were you so sympathetic on September 12th, 2001?  Were you so sympathetic on the day after, as the pile was still burning and the smell 
[00:26:30]  of death was in the air?  Were you so fucking sympathetic about their fucking cause and plight?  Were you?  No, I wasn't.  You forgot!  You forgot the people jumping out of the buildings and planes burning, fuel burning people, people  screaming in the streets.  It was horrible.  Remember, everyone remember.  Remember the fucking explosion blowing out the side of the building that we saw from 20  different fucking angles. 
[00:27:00]  Don't forget it.  It was them that did it.  Don't you understand that?  It's like the annoying part is that every imam or one of these Muslims, there's always  the but.  Not one of them will just say it.  Patrice said it and we've been saying it.  None of them will just come out and go, that was fucked up.  There's always, but the U.S. did, but they all silently agree that the end justifies the  means.  That's not entirely true.  Show me an example. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, please.  This one currently that we just brought up.  This one, by the way.  What's that?  There's three, there's two in Wisconsin and one in Minnesota that they have already come  out and have condemned it.  The imam who runs it, even the guy who wants to build it, this doctor, which is kind of  funny, all these people who came out protesting the mosque and protesting this guy, this guy's  a well-respected doctor in the community, and all these people who actually go and visit 
[00:28:00]  him for their treatment are the ones who are coming out protesting the mosque.  Hey, Stryker, what do you think about what this imam said five years ago about America's  role in the attacks?  I think it's a stupid comment on his part.  Is it just a stupid comment?  Is that all he gets is a stupid comment?  Or is that his philosophy, what he lives and breathes, what he preaches to other Muslims?  No, I don't believe that.  I mean...  Oh, stop it.  It may be his philosophy, or maybe it's something he's saying to make his point, and that's where 
[00:28:30]  I have a...  Are you fucking an Arab?  What are you doing?  Yeah, why don't you just say it?  What are you dolling it up for?  Like, oh, it was a dumb...  Listen to the past you're giving this guy.  Ah, just a dumb comment, like when Imus said nappy-headed hoes.  Just a dumb comment.  No, it resulted in the deaths of thousands of people.  That's sentiment.  Oh, yes, it did.  You don't understand, Stryker, you don't see that that's the way that all Muslims see 
[00:29:00]  this, or the majority of vocal Muslims?  No, and that's not entirely true.  That's not entirely true.  Well, then it's a coincidence.  There's always the but.  Stryker, it's a coincidence that we were saying this, that every time that there's a speaking  of the West and 9-11, there's that thing with U.S. policy, the U.S. every time, and then all  of a sudden today, a five years ago talk that this imam gave, he's been saying that, too.  I'm sorry, I'm having two conversations. 
[00:29:30]  I didn't hear all of what just the guy said.  Oh.  What's the other conversation?  Were you talking to an imam?  I'm talking to a customer.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Why don't you come back when you're not talking to a customer?  What are you saying?  Like fertilizer and heating oil?  I'm not repeating that.  You can't be talking to a...  We've got to move on.  Just right here.  Hang up.  I mean, if we were doing a quick dick joke, it's fine, but this is a pretty serious topic,  and you're having two conversations at one time.  Two conversations.  Yup.  Yup.  Thank you, sir.  Let me say hi to Adam on Long Island. 
[00:30:00]  Adam.  Morning, boys.  Good morning, Adam.  Yeah, I just wanted to ask, hear me.  I'm kind of, like, iffy on the mark, personally, but I was just wondering if maybe, like,  because we, uh, just because we believe that it's unpopular, does it make it, like, wrong  to tell them that they shouldn't vote with there?  We're not saying, well, the thing is this, I understand an unpopular speech has to be  protected, because popular speech doesn't need to be, obviously, it's not, we do have 
[00:30:30]  the right to say we don't like it there, because no one is saying, let's legislate, or let's  not allow it.  No one is saying that, no one is saying, legally, let's block it.  No one is saying, let's have the government step in and block it.  We are saying, let's try to talk them into moving it somewhere else.  Let's let them vocally know, we don't like it, we think it sucks, but no one is saying  that they can't do it.  Yeah, people are confused by that.  They think we're stepping on freedom of religion with this whole thing. 
[00:31:00]  We're not.  We're just not.  People are upset.  And they will constantly bring that subject up when you talk, uh, when you see on the  news, uh, Muslims talking about it, they'll be like, well, there is a freedom of religion  that is being, uh, uh, stepped on.  It's like, no, in the end, the mosque just might be there.  Yeah.  So, so they don't, they don't look at their own.  And good luck to it.  I'm starting to think that the mosque will now be there.  Oh, I don't.  There's too, there's too many.  I'm starting to think 62% in a poll. 
[00:31:30]  And again, that could be a slanted poll.  But if they have the legal right to do it and nobody can really infringe upon that, except  by saying their own opinion, uh, why would they not put it there?  They have every legal right to do it.  And I believe they will do it because it is what amounts to a victory flag over a battlefield.  It's a battlefield victory flag.  But why on earth wouldn't they do it?  Yeah, they, they, they probably will.  All right.  And so, and the next person that says it, oh no, they don't, that, that is what that is. 
[00:32:00]  It's fucking annoying.  Let's say hi to Al in Connecticut.  Al.  Al.  Oh my God.  Okay, Al.  I'm so heated.  Listen, how about the fact that nine, nine 11 ground zero is hollowed ground?  How about the, you can't build anything on hollowed ground, right or wrong?  The sentiment hollowed ground is annoying to me too.  It is, it's, it's a horrible, it's a little holy.  Hold on, man.  Thousands of our brothers have died right there.  I'm answering you, dude. 
[00:32:30]  Don't, what the fuck are you doing?  My brother's fine.  Yeah.  I mean, it's hollowed ground because yeah, something horrible happened there.  I don't, but I'm saying strip clubs should be within two blocks.  I don't mind that.  It's not about that.  It's about, this is the group.  Yeah, I agree too.  It's not like, yeah.  Don't say it's hollowed ground.  It's not like within two blocks should be a devoid of anything unethical and should be like a  fucking church.  I'm not saying that.  On hollowed ground in Indian territory, there's gambling casinos.  I love it.  Exactly.  Am I wrong or right?  Am I wrong or right?  You cannot build our enemy pyramid on our own hollowed ground. 
[00:33:00]  I love sitting on it.  Our brothers.  Am I saying something wrong or right?  The term hollowed ground is just annoying me because it's a hard, the site of a fucking,  it makes it too lighty and airy.  It's the site of a fucking mass murder.  But yeah, mass murder site.  That's it.  It's not lighty and airy.  It's what's reality.  It's a little too religious.  No, it's the same sense where the Indians can build their casinos on the same ground  that they lost.  Oh, believe me.  I love sitting on sitting bull as I say, hit me. 
[00:33:30]  Listen, what I really wanted to say is, you know what, Jim, you're a genius.  Oh, thanks.  You are lyrically a genius when you talk.  What's he curing today?  What disease are you curing?  You're a genius.  Herpes, one person at a time.  No, and Ant, Ant, I used to think you were a racist, but I just think you're allergic  to dumb humans.  Ah, thank you, sir.  I am.  I sneeze every time I get around him.  I'm a black man, and I agree with your point.  You don't sound like one. 
[00:34:00]  Boo!  Boo!  I agree with your point.  I agree with your point that you were speaking the other day when we were talking about  this, I don't know, the sports guy having a bunch of kids and doing all this stuff.  Yes.  You are dead on point.  I do not disagree with you.  I wish more black people felt the way I did.  Thank you, sir.  I know you're not a racist because I know you love blacks, baby.  Oh, well.  I don't know about that.  I think you got that point a little wrong.  You love black women, maybe not black pussy, but you love humans, man.  No, I don't like the black pussy. 
[00:34:30]  Look back at Lolly.  Yo, I love you guys, man.  All right, bro.  Thanks, bro.  Thank you.  I like saying bro.  It keeps me hip with the community.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, what's going on?  Chris.  Hey, fellas.  How are we doing?  Hi, Mimi.  Hi, buddy.  Mimi.  A couple of things.  I don't know.  You know, I'm a teacher.  I've already talked a few times before.  I got to talk about, like, religion in my class and the beginnings of all the religions.  And I got to bite my tongue and say the right thing that it says in a textbook, even though  at the back of my mind is screaming profanities. 
[00:35:00]  But I wonder, like, why would they even propose to put the mosque there?  Like, how big of douchebags do you have to be to propose to put this mosque there?  And now, if it's there, and Americans fuck with it, or New Yorkers fuck with it, which  I feel like is definitely going to happen.  If anything, it's going to pull police presence away from areas where they need it and put it  in front of this fucking mosque.  But won't that just give the Muslims' cart launch to attack again? 
[00:35:30]  Obviously not on such a big scale as 9-11 was, but, like, they're like, well, you  fucked with us.  Now we've got to fuck with you.  Dude, you see, what happens is when you start thinking, like, a lot of, on Reddit last night  there was a story of, are we giving them, is all the negativity going to fuel Al-Qaeda?  Are they going to use that?  But that is going by the logic that they are rational people and are always reacting to  our irrational behavior.  Instead of understanding that there is a religious jihadist mentality or religious fanaticism, 
[00:36:00]  which is not rational.  It's almost like, well, if we don't do the wrong thing, then they won't react.  Instead of realizing maybe they're the aggressor, maybe as well.  I'm sure we are, too.  But maybe their fucking irrational religious obsession is responsible for a lot of their  behavior as opposed to a rational reaction to what we're doing.  You're right.  I mean, freaking jihad is one of the vocab words for the unit for comparative religion.  And my kids ask every year, every year. 
[00:36:30]  And they're so misinformed.  You know, it's not their fault.  But they, first of all, I think Iraq did 9-11 because they're idiots.  But they ask, like, if every Muslim is a terrorist.  That's what they ask.  And then there's, like, either a Muslim in my class or a Sikh that is mistaken for a Muslim.  And that's when I start to feel bad.  Yeah.  The poor Sikhs.  Well, not even the Sikhs, but, like, we get it.  The elephants are important. 
[00:37:00]  But, uh...  Put a big visor on your fucking turban.  I know.  Just make it look a little better, like a Yankee logo on the front.  Well, just...  Well, how about enough of your religious clothing for all of you?  Take your yarmulkes off, your Sikh hats.  Yeah.  Your fucking...  Whatever it is Catholics wear, the things...  Enough!  I'm tired of seeing people's religion by their outfits.  Go fuck yourselves, everybody.  Put a fucking Mets hat on, you cunts.  And this is everywhere.  Across the board.  What do Catholics wear that you could see?  I don't know.  A small child on their dick. 
[00:37:30]  Across.  Across would be the big one.  How about you stop it?  Yeah.  If I can see your religion by your outfit, you're a fucking irritant.  We should all just blend in nicely.  Yeah.  Just walk around.  Put on a fucking...  An Armani fucking Yankee hat.  If they exist.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Let's, uh...  Annoise me.  Let's, uh...  Go to Debra in New York.  Debra.  Hello?  Hi, Debra.  Hello.  Go ahead, Debra.  Hi, everyone.  How are you today?  Good.  Very good.  Well, I just wanted to say, um...  From what I understand, um...  There, that mosque was there prior to 9-11. 
[00:38:00]  And now they're making this big deal about putting it there, but it's been there.  And not one news report has mentioned that it was there before...  That was a Burlington house clothing factory.  It was a Burlington clothing factory.  So were they practicing, uh...  The Islamic...  But the mosque...  The mosque may not have been exactly in the spot that it...  That it is...  That they're going to put it, but it was right there by 9...  Well, pre-9-11 mosque being there, and then building it after 9-11 is a big difference. 
[00:38:30]  Was the mosque destroyed?  That's like...  You know, I'm...  Apparently, I mean, listen...  I'm sure a sushi place in Pearl Harbor was fine before, you know, December 7th.  My husband's a police officer.  He was there.  You know, we had dealt with it.  My brother-in-law worked for Canada Fitzgerald.  Didn't die, thankfully, but there was a lot...  You know, we were very touched by the whole incident.  And you have to go back to the freedom of religion.  No, you don't miss... 
[00:39:00]  Hold on, this...  Nobody's saying they don't have the legal right to practice their religion.  A lot of people are missing that point.  Nobody...  Why do people...  No one's saying that.  No, hold on.  I am...  No, I am...  I couldn't agree with all of you more.  So don't misinterpret me.  I couldn't agree with your point more.  I'm like snippy.  I'm not being snippy.  I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to make a point.  Okay.  From what I understand, the mosque was there.  So no...  I have not heard one news report that there was a mosque down by ground zero at all. 
[00:39:30]  And they're telling...  They're saying that they're going to put a mosque there and that it's...  It couldn't be more insensitive.  I couldn't agree with you more.  All right.  Thank you.  What bothers me, though, is like when Stryker calls and we're talking...  It's like when this imam's comments from five years ago surface.  That is a massive insight into that guy's mentality and his motives.  And all...  Like Stryker, all you'll say is, well, you know, that wasn't a smart thing to say.  That's beyond not a smart thing to say. 
[00:40:00]  The guy also said the word niggers in his speech.  He said whites and niggers.  He said that in his...  And of course, the paper said he's...  You've got to take the good with the bad.  But to me, that's a dumb remark.  That goes under the category of a stupid remark.  He said it wrong.  That's stupid.  I wish I hadn't said that.  I've never cared where a mosque has been built.  Personally, dude, I've never thought about it.  It's never bothered me.  I've never wondered how many mosques were in this country.  And it has never given me pause where one was being built until this one. 
[00:40:30]  Right.  So don't make it look like we're all these freedom of religion anti-Muslim fanatics.  Build as many fucking mosques as you want.  I don't care.  I love when people say that because I do care.  Because I don't want this blaring out every fucking day when I'm trying to sleep.  What the fuck is that?  Shut up! 
[00:41:00]  The Manhattan mosque is five blocks from the World Trade Center site.  But it's been there, right?  No.  Five blocks.  Man, what are you going to do?  Five blocks is pretty much right there.  Sharia law.  Maybe we can do that too.  And how about rape victims can have fucking rocks thrown at them?  Man, instead of talking about how the West has spilled so much blood, why don't you talk  about that and how rape victims are fucking jailed as adulterous as or killed?  If you ever make it to ground zero, walk around the side streets and you'll see that this  is, you know, a lot of fucking businesses still not open and stuff. 
[00:41:30]  And, you know, five, six blocks from the fucking towers.  Yep.  The whole area is still just kind of hanging out.  Manhattan mosque, five blocks from World Trade Center.  Since 1970.  Honestly, don't care.  Isn't that kind of before?  Don't care.  It should stay there.  That's fine.  Isn't that before the World Trade Center was even built?  Yeah.  I think the Trade Center was, what, 76, 77?  74, somewhere.  Something like that.  Something like that.  Don't care that that mosque is there.  Fine.  Whatever. 
[00:42:00]  Let me say hi to Bumper the Trucker.  Bumper the Trucker.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing today?  I'd like to just weigh in on this.  I'm from Somerset, Pennsylvania, which is, like, right almost where Flight 93 crashed.  Okay.  It wound up going down four miles from my house.  And what people don't seem to understand is, technically, this was an act of war.  And what I just can't understand is that they don't have enough sensitivity to understand that. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  You know, it just pisses me off because, I mean, all this carnage was caused by them.  And it's just like they're sticking their middle fingers up in the air, like religious freedom and all that.  Who cares?  It was still an act of war.  Yeah.  Why should we be tolerant?  Because we're dumb.  Why?  I don't want to be tolerant.  I don't want to be tolerant.  I've had it with tolerance and political correctness and having to fucking take a dick up the ass that they want to sit here. 
[00:43:00]  Well, that's the good part.  That's so much.  But just have to take it that they want to build it.  And you know that there are people just cheering that this thing is going to go up there.  Aha.  Look at dumb Americans.  Look at them, dummies.  And you think they're going to go, oh, wow, that's very tolerant of them.  Let's not hate them anymore.  Right.  They hate everything we do, everything we think, everything we believe in, our way of life is hated by them. 
[00:43:30]  Then why are they living in this country?  Oh, it's wonderful.  Because it's wonderful.  And it's a great place for them to become martyrs and heroes.  Because they could be right here among us and at any moment's notice, just fucking get a group together and do horrible things.  Sound paranoid?  Maybe.  But you know what?  Based on past performance?  You think all the Muslims that live in America think that way?  I would love to see a few that will speak out against it without the asterisk of, oh, but you know, America has done things in the past. 
[00:44:00]  So what?  Look at your savage fucking countries, cutting people's heads off, hands off feet, paralyzing people, stoning rape victims, dressing your women like animals because you can't fucking control yourselves by looking at a fucking woman's midriff or face because you're fucking uncivilized.  And by the way, where's any one ounce of fucking gratitude?  Like, why is there not one ounce of gratitude? 
[00:44:30]  Like, the U.S. is so terrible for the fact that we fucking were funneling weapons to bin Laden in Afghanistan to help get the Russians out.  I think that's kind of the way they fucking helped the Vietnamese against us.  It's kind of the way we fought each other without having World War III.  Yeah, by the way, you're exactly right.  Where's the fucking gratitude?  They talk about how, well, the Russians came here and weren't able to beat us.  Yeah, they had our weapons, motherfucker.  Yes.  They had all our shit fighting the Russians.  The Russians would have swept in there and fucking just overrun those fucking dirt bags. 
[00:45:00]  I don't think the Russians were as obsessed with civilian casualties as we are.  No.  They'd bomb a mosque in a second.  Someone on my Twitter, respect the opinion, but you guys are starting to sound like Sharpton.  You have a right to protest.  They have a right to build.  Well, yeah, we know they were.  We know that.  We're not saying that.  I don't understand why people don't understand the basic point.  We understand they have the right to build.  Can we just say it again?  Yeah, how many times do I have to say that?  We know there's a right.  We know there's a lot of people in this country that are very upset by this. 
[00:45:30]  We understand freedom of religion and all that crap.  There's a mosque five blocks away.  I don't care.  Right.  I just don't care.  No one is saying that legally they can't do it.  I don't care how many mosques there are, man.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I really don't.  We have a wonderful fucking system here in this country where, yes, they do have the  legal right to build there, but people are speaking out because it shouldn't be built  there.  Or the majority of the people think.  Yeah, well, some people are assholes. 
[00:46:00]  The percentage of people that believe that it should be built.  Oh, yeah.  It outweighs the people that...  Whatever.  I think they're going to move it.  But this guy is not...  Like, when you listen to the way he's talking, this is...  It's fucking disgusting, man.  And on our dime, he's touring his fucking home land.  Oh, no, but he's not trying to get funds for the mosque.  No.  Guys, Dr. Chris has been calling over and over again since six o'clock because he's got  a great phone call.  All righty.  Go ahead, Dr. Chris.  It's like...  How many times did he call, by the way?  Like three times.  Yeah, because you thought this is just going to fucking set the radio world on fire. 
[00:46:30]  Let's go, Dr. Chris.  Come on.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Come on, Dr. Chris.  Let it rip.  It's like opening a rehab in Courtney Love's Crack House.  I'm telling you.  It's terrible.  What's that?  It's like opening a Crack House.  I heard you!  Boo!  Look, asshole.  You had to square your ass.  Oh, come on.  If I hung...  If I hang up on your dumb ass, it's because I know how to do fucking radio. 
[00:47:00]  That thing sucked.  Why would you keep calling back after being hung up on over and over again, you stupid  fuck?  You fucking chode.  You fucking ninny hammer.  I'm sorry.  Fucking this guy...  He's apologizing.  I'm sorry.  He's apologizing for his orange joke.  This guy fucking hears a dial tone three or four times.  He goes, oh, oh, wow, that must have been a mistake.  I better call back with my witty fucking phone call.  It's not witty.  I just thought it was a great idea.  It sucked a dick. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, lucky hit.  It was terrible.  I was trying to save your ass, but no, you think you know better than me.  Wrong!  What is a chode?  I've heard that before.  Oh, chode's a...  I think it's a cum.  Nope.  What is it?  What is it?  Chode is where you got a penis that's fucking thicker than longer.  Is it really?  Yes.  No way.  That's also...  It's another one for Lucky Duck.  Are you kidding me?  I think a chode is where you got a fucked up penis where it's thicker than...  The space between...  Oh, that's hilarious, dude.  A male nutsack and his asshole. 
[00:48:00]  I thought that was a taint.  Oh, they do a...  There's a taint definition to it, too.  It could be multi-defined.  Uh...  I...  Uh...  Yeah, no, a chode is like a...  Chode.  A fucking stub cock.  A stubby one.  No?  Oh, yeah, it says, my boyfriend wanted a hand job, but I couldn't get a good grip because  he had a chode, which would fit into that criteria.  Yeah, that's what I've always thought of.  Yes. 
[00:48:30]  Wow, I never knew that.  I thought chode was like...  You got it?  Well...  Come on.  The first definition on Urban Dictionary says a penis wider than it is long.  There you go.  And then the second definition is a chode is a bunch of people that sit around and argue  over the definition of the word chode.  Ah!  Ah!  We're chodes.  Yeah.  Where's the word come from?  Like, what fucking...  Uh, it's from the Greek.  Uh, chodes.  Yeah, she was a warrior who had a fat cock. 
[00:49:00]  That fucking guy called more than three times, by the way.  With that horrid joke.  It was funny.  If I hang up on you, it's because I know how to do radio.  Well, we only...  Here's what happens.  There's nine phone lines.  And, you know, sometimes you gotta make sacrifices when you've got a really hot topic.  So you're blowing off people that their point has already been made maybe earlier or yesterday  or they're just fucking stupid assholes.  Yeah.  And you quickly hang up.  You can't be polite when you're, you know, trying to work the phones.  And this guy just kept getting through over and over and over again. 
[00:49:30]  It's like, get the fucking hand.  We don't want to hear your shit.  All right.  We should take our first break.  That fucking Miss Universe was last night.  Oh, my God.  You missed out.  Just wonderful, wonderful girls.  I actually agreed with a point Bill O'Reilly made.  Really?  I want to fucking slap myself.  Damn.  He's not a dumb guy.  I mean, you know.  I know.  Did he say that a chode is a cock that's fatter than it is long? 
[00:50:00]  He has one.  He's a ninny hammer.  He has a chode.  Fucking ninny hammer.  Now, you made a good point, though.  I'll explain it after the break.  Ooh.  Also, um...  Gregorio.  Remember yesterday we were talking to Kenny and we don't know what makes him happy whatsoever  and he was at the fucking OzFest show, stone-faced.  Yes.  Beginning of the show and the end of the show, which those pictures on your Twitter are very funny,  Jimmy.  Looks like you photoshopped him in.  Well, on the way home yesterday, we actually found out what makes him really funny. 
[00:50:30]  He is a fucking creep.  Yeah.  We know that, but I'd love to see why.  He couldn't get enough of splashing people in his car.  Oh, wow.  And I actually was fortunate enough to film one good one.  That is fun.  Oh, I got to see it.  But he gets so fucking excited.  Giddy.  To splash people.  Did you see him?  At one point, he stopped in the middle of the block because he really wanted to get  up to speed.  He goes...  Oh, he had to line up?  He said something like, watch this. 
[00:51:00]  And these two poor women...  What a creep!  I don't think they're poor women.  I thought it was hilarious, by the way.  They actually tried to step back as fast as they can and they just got sprayed by a wave  from Kenny's car.  The video's doing really well.  People are really fucking loving it.  I got to see it.  Really fucking loving it.  Me and Jimmy laughed ourselves sick.  Yeah.  We laughed ourselves sick.  Oh, where is it?  I got to see it.  It was funny.  Right there on church.  I fucking love when this happens. 
[00:51:30]  Because I get it by accident sometimes.  We laughed ourselves fucking silly.  Fun in the Rain with Club Soda Kenny on my YouTube channel.  Yeah, it was pouring.  I'll go to my Twitter.  There it is.  Black girl.  No, the old lady.  They're picking targets.  No, we're playing you drop something with this lady that has a cane.  Oh, right.  Madam, you dropped something.  Miss.  So she's on the curb.  Drop something.  It's pouring.  She's got an umbrella.  Now she thinks she dropped something.  She's looking back.  In the puddle. 
[00:52:00]  She bends over.  In the puddle.  She bends over.  Now she loses her umbrella in the wind.  Now she's trying to find what she dropped.  Miss, it looked important.  It looked important.  Madam, here it is.  Is that it?  That's just a setup.  What an asshole.  Kenny's a jerk.  Kenny's wet.  He deserves it.  Yeah, for the people that hate this video, look how wet Kenny just got.  Kenny's soaked.  I got more wet than that lady.  Serves you right, you creep. 
[00:52:30]  Look how creepy Kenny drives.  All right, watch this.  Let me get these people with a puddle.  Watch.  Look, he's in the middle of the block.  Yeah, yeah.  You got to go slow.  Right here, slow.  Oh, my God.  And then I had to do a YouTube classic.  Slow-mo it.  I had to do a YouTube classic.  The slow-mo.  Look at this.  Look at her jumping out of the way with a huge fucking wave.  Got a lot of rain in New York.  And then a slow-mo. 
[00:53:00]  Seeing Club Soda Kenny laugh is really creepy.  Oh, that is classic.  Yeah, it's a good one, man.  Whatever.  Slow-mo's for a while.  God damn.  I'll retweet it this morning for the people that haven't seen it yet, but I think most  of you have because it's doing really well.  Wow, that is fucking hysterical.  All right.  First break.  Got to get into Tiger Woods' divorce and some other things. 
[00:53:30]  We'll move on from the monster for a little while.  I love how those just happen so quickly, these divorces.  Huh?  Some people had to wait years.  Yeah, I don't get it.  The more I think about it, you had the worst fucking lawyer, I think, in divorce history.  Oh, ever.  I really do.  I know.  You're right.  You could explain it again for the people after the break.  Stay there.  All right.  All right.  Can you see the real me, doctor?  Doctor!  Can you see the real me, doctor? 
[00:54:00]  Oh, doctor!  He's dead.  You hear John Entwistle playing?  He's dead.  All right.  Cocaine, right?  Uh, coal fucking cane. 
[00:54:30]  That cocaine is for the young.  Yeah, you can't be John Entwistle and be snorting the old cocaine.  Look, man, I was growing up in the 80s.  I tried some of that shit.  Of course.  Who didn't?  Right?  And when you wake up in a cold sweat as an adult going, holy shit, I can't believe I took  those chances.  I can't imagine doing coke at my age.  Can't even fucking imagine it.  You know when the normal person, the reasonable person, even though you're not very reasonable  if you even try it, but the more reasonable person stops doing coke, when you're in the 
[00:55:00]  shower begging God not to kill you that night because your heart is fucking ready to explode.  Oh, yeah.  That was exactly what I had happen.  That's when you decide, perhaps this is not the drug for me.  The stupid just get me to morning?  Yeah, yeah.  Conversation you have with yourself.  Just get me to the morning.  I just want to see the sun.  I just want to see the sun.  And for some reason, you think if you see the sun, you'll be fine. 
[00:55:30]  I'll be okay.  You have an experience there, Red?  Well, I figured it out when I ran out one night.  It was already morning.  Like, it was like 7.30 in the morning.  Coke knows no daytime.  And I decided that I just had to get a little more high.  So, I dug all the coke snot out of my nose and ate it.  Oh, God.  Way to go, Richard Prada.  But you know what?  Got a little more high.  Got a little high.  Fuck that.  Got a little high.  Usually, you have the conversation with God and, you know, get me to morning.  Yep.  And that lasts a day or two. 
[00:56:00]  Let's be honest with each other.  Yeah, I'll never do it again.  But in my case, man, that's all I needed.  Never looked back.  Talking about coke.  Because it took out John Entwistle a few years ago, Jimmy.  Cocaine, huh?  Yeah.  It's one of those deals where it's like...  And I said, at my age, I can't even imagine doing cocaine.  Like, I do wake up some mornings thinking I'm back where I used to be.  And I wake up in a cold sweat.  Like, why would you take a chance like that?  Did you ever...  Stupid fucking chances.  Did you ever inhale through your nose at some point and go like, wow, that smell... 
[00:56:30]  Like, I fucking smell coke.  I never smoked it.  Like, no, I mean, just through your nose.  Like, it almost smells and tastes like...  You just snorted a line.  Maybe a little rock is just hanging out still.  For 20 years?  Like, there's a drip out of nowhere.  Yeah.  Really?  What is that?  It's weird, because sometimes if you inhale deep, maybe in the shower or something, there's  just some weird, like, mixture of moisture and air.  That hasn't happened to me in a long time.  It goes on.  A very long time.  And you're like, wow, that fucking taste and smells like coke. 
[00:57:00]  But I think I never even did coke.  Because, I mean, I went to Geneseo.  Yeah.  What kind of coke were they getting up there?  Oh.  By the time...  By the time it makes it that far north?  Yeah.  From Miami to Geneseo.  Really?  Am I really doing coke at that point?  You're snorting decks at your knees.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And fucking foot powder, because it's been stepped on so much.  Baby laxative.  That's what I'm saying.  You got to think that it was stepped on way too many times by the time it got into my stupid  nose.  You know what's a good movie about coke?  I mean, I think we also...  When we had Frank...  Frank Vincent. 
[00:57:30]  No.  Oh, Frank Caliendo?  No!  Why don't I yell Frank Vincent?  That's just stupid.  Here's a guy that's doing cocaine.  Here's a guy who sells coke.  Is he?  No, Frank...  That here's a guy is making fucking millions of dollars.  I know.  And thanks, that son of a bitch.  I know.  Don't make fun of him all you want.  Isn't that amazing?  That Caliendo knows what the fuck he's doing in the end, all right?  I'll fucking suck Caliendo's dick.  I wish someone would say some shit.  Isn't he making tens of millions of dollars a year now?  Yeah, he's doing great.  Here's a guy sucking my dick.  Here's a guy that can't fucking get the money in his bank account fast enough. 
[00:58:00]  Dude, his fucking Bush impression is scary good.  Yeah, it is.  He is good.  Wait, who is that Frank?  The black drug dealer.  I mean...  Oh, I wasn't here for that.  Okay.  Oh, right, right, right.  The guy from...  Frank Lucas.  Frank Lucas.  Okay.  Who Denzel played in American Gangster.  That was an amazing insight into...  Wasn't it heroin, though, that he imported from Vietnam in the bodies, in the body bags?  Was it heroin?  I don't remember.  Probably...  It probably was, because, you know, Vietnam's not known for coke, so... 
[00:58:30]  It's probably heroin.  I don't remember.  Southeast Asia.  Yeah, in the fucking body bags.  In the coffins of soldiers.  In the coffins of soldiers.  Did he go all in and put it in their assholes?  Oh, man.  How did he put it in the bodies?  I don't think he got a mule in assholes at that point when it's just a body bag and dead bodies.  Who the fuck's going to check a cadaver for fucking...  No one's checking that shit.  Yeah.  If you go to...  If you're...  You know, whatever.  I'm just going to make some dumb fucking comments.  I'm done with making dumb comments.  But to get the...  To get somebody... 
[00:59:00]  To actually approach somebody in the military and come up with that idea, like,  Hey, why don't we put it in with the fucking bodies of the dead soldiers?  Brass balls.  What a set of balls.  Oh.  Because that is really awful.  An update from yesterday's show, too.  That Sam Adams thing we were talking about?  Yeah.  I got the real fucking bottle, motherfucker.  You got the Millennium?  I got the fucking Millennium.  I looked it up.  Danny said...  Danny found one that's going for $4,900.  And I remember the wood case. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  And when I moved to my new place, I was this close to putting it in my garbage chute.  Oh.  Just to clean up...  Just clean up a little bit.  Just take five grand and slam it down the chute, right?  Oh, I'm a minimalist because I fucking move so many times.  I don't like clutter at all.  That's some clutter.  And I almost bailed on that bottle.  And I opened it up.  It has the little blue felt fucking bottle bag, whatever you want to call it, signed by  Jim Cook, but it's not numbered.  Oh, wait a minute.  So I'm wondering if that's either more valuable or less valuable. 
[01:00:00]  Now, you really took a look and saw...  It's Jim Cook's fucking signature.  I mean that there was no number anywhere on the bottle.  I think he would have wrote the numbers by hand, I'm thinking.  Unless it's somewhere else on the bottle I didn't see.  I got to look at my bottle tonight and see.  But I got the real fucking deal.  I'll tweak the picture today.  It's Sam Adams, Triple M.  Triple M, the millennium.  You can look at it on Google Images.  They say rare.  Very rare.  A lot of people saying it's rare.  Rare.  I think my brother has to pay taxes.  I'll give it to him.  He'll fucking sell it on eBay. 
[01:00:30]  I don't fucking need it.  That's something, man.  That's it.  That's exactly what I got.  That's the bottle.  And that's the picture I'll be taking today.  With the wood box, the bottle, the blue felt.  Looking good.  Yeah, I'll fucking throw that online today.  I'll take a picture of me just swigging out of it.  Getting all hammered and throwing up on the fucking case.  If people cared, I would do something really obnoxious with that bottle.  Absolutely.  Just something extremely obnoxious.  I got to think of something good. 
[01:01:00]  Could take it down to the range.  That's funny.  That would be a hell of a shot.  That's a $5,000 shot.  Yeah, that's what you want to do in these times.  Just shoot $5,000.  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  What were we chatting about before the break?  I know we had a little teaser.  Oh, yeah.  We'll do the Tiger Woods in a second.  But this is a quickie because living in New York, I'm going to move out of New York.  Really?  Yeah, I know it's a Rush Limbaugh thing to say, I'm leaving New York. 
[01:01:30]  I can't do Rush Limbaugh.  And he did, though.  He said, I'm out of that stupid fucking city.  And you know what?  I'm not a Rush Limbaugh fan by any means, but I'm sick of this fucking city.  I really am.  And I care about the common man, believe it or not.  MTA.  This stupid MTA.  Ready for this one?  They're thinking of raising the cost of the monthly MetroCard.  The MetroCards get you around town on the subways and stuff, right?  From $89 to $130 fucking dollars.  That's quite an increase. 
[01:02:00]  What does that get you, by the way?  They're squeezing people to the point they're going to be desperate to live.  What does that get you?  How many rides?  How long?  I guess a monthly is unlimited.  It's a monthly?  I would imagine.  Now, aren't they trying to put limits on the unlimited, where you only get a certain  amount of rides per unlimited, which is ridiculous, because that's not unlimited.  But I heard tell that they're actually going to limit the unlimited.  Well, what?  After they get it up to $130?  Even after they raise the price.  Who could afford $130 a month for a monthly MetroCard? 
[01:02:30]  We get the me thing.  How obnoxious.  Really obnoxious.  People are dying out there.  I know.  Fuck them!  I want a fancier MetroCard.  Paint mine gold!  Hello, scum!  Yeah, you know what?  That's funny, but when there's desperate times, that's when I know they're coming for me.  I'm not that stupid and open-minded.  So I want these people to be able to afford their fucking MetroCards, okay? 
[01:03:00]  If they can't afford bread, let them eat MetroCards!  Tee-hee-hee-hee-hee!  The other schmuck can't afford $130 a month.  Simple as that.  They can't afford that!  That's crazy money for a fucking train.  Going from $89 to $130.  Because obviously they're doing something wrong at the MTA.  They can't figure out their budget.  They can't figure out their money issues.  Those fucking...  Every MTA mode of transportation is packed in the morning. 
[01:03:30]  You see the buses, the subways, everything.  How are they fucking losing money?  A weekly card going from $27 to $38 for a weekly.  Holy shit.  New Jersey Transit Monthly is over $400.  For D-Boy?  Is that what D-Boy's doing?  To come into the city from Jersey, it's costing you $400 a month.  Really?  That really makes fucking sense.  Is he smoking cigars in a wood-paneled room with gas lighting on the train?  D-Boy, maybe.  Yeah, that's true.  He might have a car that they allow him to do that. 
[01:04:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, D-Boy.  What do you got?  You got a MetroCard or some kind of fucking Jersey Transit?  Jersey?  Dude, $400 a month?  Nice work, Lou.  There it is.  Dropping everything out of his dumb wallet.  His dumb wallet.  Yeah, where is that?  Oh, okay.  That is $414.  And how long does this last?  Forever?  It's just a month.  A month?  Yeah, that's a month.  One month. 
[01:04:30]  I used to...  That would have been rent for me.  Of course.  I could have actually lived in a place.  When I was commuting from Huntington, when we worked at NAW, we were making pretty good  money already, and that hurt to pay that.  How are the blowjobs, though, during that?  Because they're obviously sending girls in to suck your dick tasty.  How about this?  You do the right thing, and you pay for the monthly, and half the time you can't even  get a fucking seat.  So shouldn't you get a break that you're not fucking sitting every day?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  It never works in the favor of the customer now, does it? 
[01:05:00]  Oh, wow.  That is criminal.  They raised it right there.  35%, I think, earlier this year.  35%?  Yeah, it used to be like 300 and something.  Don't worry, because when things get better, they're going to lower it back down to where  it was, right?  Oh, that's right.  They never do that.  I was at a family party over the weekend, and...  Manson?  Love that family.  And people were just sitting around bitching the entire fucking time. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Because they're getting squeezed to the point, like, they're not enjoying their lives.  Everyone is.  They're like, oh, I'm working 16 hours a day, I had to pick up a second job, my wife's got  to work now, and blah, blah, blah.  It's just unbelievable what's happening out there.  It's all everyone's doing right now is suffering.  And then to, you know, that's fresh in my mind, and then to see the MetroCard going up from  89 to 130, who the fuck could afford that for subways?  Especially that increase.  The people that are taking the subways can't afford cabs and other ways to get around town  to begin with.  And they're not even getting a simple cost of living raise. 
[01:06:00]  No.  You know, they're probably making less than they were.  It's criminal what the MTA is doing in the city.  Fucking criminal.  Squeezing everybody.  Right.  God, that's amazing.  And our dumb mayor is, you know, he's helpless when it comes to that shit, right?  He's a good mayor.  He's a dunce.  The fucking governor's a dummy.  They don't understand.  They're squeezing the people out.  People are leaving New York, but they're finding other means to get where they got  to go, carpooling, whatever.  So they wind up losing money by increasing the fare. 
[01:06:30]  Right.  It dunces.  Oh, someone's got a great idea.  Travis in Jersey.  Oh.  What's going on, buddy?  How are you?  Hey, man.  Hello.  Hey, you should definitely do a twit video of you giving that bottle to a homeless guy  and watching him drink it.  Oh, no.  He won't even know it's $5,000.  Oh, my God.  And he'll just chug it down like it's swilled.  And all he would have to do is fucking...  Yeah. 
[01:07:00]  A lot of the homeless guys could figure some shit out if they knew.  If he only knew.  Trust me.  If a homeless guy knew it was a $5,000 bottle of liquor, he would figure out a way to get  the money for it.  He'd take shits in the wooden case.  But I'd never...  Dude, you're brilliant.  He's living in his portable toilet.  His house.  His house.  You never tell the guy.  You just give him a bottle and just sit there.  I'll sit there.  Oh, thank you very much.  I'll sit there and drink a bottle with the homeless guy.  My brother did that once.  Dumps him out for his homies.  Yeah.  There's a few in my neighborhood I trust enough to fucking have a beer with. 
[01:07:30]  Really?  Oh, fucking yeah.  Why not?  You don't share the bottle, right?  Why?  It's alcohol.  It kills everything.  That's true.  Fuck it.  I say wave a MetroCard in his homeless face.  Do this under his chin with a...  Yes.  A MetroCard you could readily afford.  Let's say hi to Sean in Georgia.  Sean.  Hey there, Sean.  I just want to point out that that $414 is slightly less than my mortgage.  Holy shit.  There's no way a fucking train fare should be the same as a mortgage. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  For a month.  Yeah, same thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're all missing the point here.  How shitty is your house?  Actually, I got it on a foreclosure.  I got it for $55,000 and it immediately got insured for $189,000.  The house next door to him was...  Yeah.  D-Boy's paid about $5,000 a year just to get into his job.  Holy shit.  That's one stupid bill, remember, you know.  That's criminal.  Is that tax deductible? 
[01:08:30]  It better be.  Oh, God, yeah.  It's 100% right off.  Yes?  Yes.  I think so.  Should be.  Watch me be wrong and the government comes.  The government allows you that.  The government allows you that.  Well, Cody's saying he spends that much money in gas a month, so it's not that bad.  Oh, it's with a clock in his stomach.  Yeah, you know what?  Gas and commuting and all that shit, it's like you're going to wind up paying a certain amount of money.  Oh, it adds up the parking.  It goes back to Ann's point, though.  They find excuses why they have to raise everything, but they never take the surcharges back after things balance out. 
[01:09:00]  Remember the cabs all added a surcharge in New York City because of gas prices.  When gas was way up high.  Gas prices sort of dropped a bit, enough to get rid of the fucking surcharge, and they're like,  now they kind of bury that surcharge in there, you don't even know where it is anymore.  And it never fails, I've talked about this before, too, when the gas prices, you hear on the business report,  and gas prices today, wow, really spiking up at $80 a barrel,  and the fucking guy is out there with a poll and the new numbers increasing the fucking price of gas 
[01:09:30]  because it went up that day in the stock market, and then the second it goes down,  if you ask them about the price, they're like, well, it takes time for it to get to us,  where we then lower the price.  Like, oh, you raised the motherfucker, you couldn't raise it quick enough.  It's all bullshit.  When the price of gas went up, motherfucker.  I don't know how this is all going to end, man.  Gouging.  Because I don't know how.  Incomplete and utter chaotic revolution.  You think?  Oh, it's got to.  I think eventually, I don't know if we live that long, but the country just breaks apart to save itself. 
[01:10:00]  Like Rome, I think.  Breaks apart.  A Roman Empire.  Breaks apart, but we sort of get along.  Yeah?  I think that's what's going to end up happening eventually.  Little sections that...  Because this is insane.  It's insane.  I've never seen the country so divided by geography.  You know, the South, the South Midwest, like Texas and Arizona, New Mexico, states like that.  The North, the East Coast, West Coast. 
[01:10:30]  Like, it's very, very divided now as far as how we're thinking.  And it's always kind of been that way a little bit, especially, you know, the Northeast has always been pretty liberal.  And the Southwest has been pretty conservative.  But now, it's just, there are so many topics that are really, like, galvanizing each little section.  There's a divide absolutely happening in this country.  I've seen it more than I ever have in my life. 
[01:11:00]  So, we'll see.  We'll see what happens.  Because unless there's this uniting force, something that happens that unites us as a country, everything we talk about is divisive.  So, every subject that comes up on the news is now a subject to divide the country.  It's not just simple debate anymore.  It is, I do not like you being part of this country thinking like that.  It's really...  No one listens to the other side.  It's scary yet kind of exciting and titillating at the same time. 
[01:11:30]  I kind of like anarchy, to tell you the truth.  That's why I have a tough time.  I do have a tough time talking politics because I just know no one listens to anyone.  It's just fucking point, point, point, point, point, point.  And the other person is sitting there waiting so they can go point, point, point, point, point, point.  You're never going to change anyone's mind is what it is.  I felt like when we were growing up, there was more of a give and take.  Yeah, yeah.  Not a, oh my God, give and take.  But it seemed like at least there was a little more listening going on.  I've noticed when I sit there and have no response to someone's point, I'll really think it over. 
[01:12:00]  And kind of, there are times I'll be like, wow, that was a great point.  I never thought of it that way.  Yeah, touche.  But there are a lot of people that just will never change their opinion on anything.  I've had a lot of people, like, change by the way I think.  I've had people make really valid points.  Yeah.  Especially during racial discussions when you're having those discussions with black guys who you like.  And you're really being honest and they're being honest. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, Patrice, okay.  Yeah, or Keith or any of those guys that I've argued with and a lot of times I have not seen their point.  I thought it was ridiculous and there's been other times I'm like, ah, fuck, you know what?  That makes a lot of sense.  Yeah.  It all depends on how honest you're being with the other person.  Yeah, yeah.  When you can actually be open and honest and not be afraid of what you're saying and shit,  it makes it a lot easier to get points across that might not change people's minds but get them thinking a little more.  Holla.  Holla.  I want to change the world.  Tiger Woods, that's what we were leading to.  Oh, yes. 
[01:13:00]  It's his insta-divorce.  This is amazing.  I don't know how that happens.  Three months, I think, right?  Wait.  When did they?  Oh, no.  The divorce is.  That happened in November, that whole thing.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, obviously.  But I think the whole divorce proceedings, I'm trying to figure it out because they were going to try to work it out.  I think Tiger was sort of trying for his image and she was like, she was done when she fucking took the golf club and beat the shit out of his Escalade and possibly him.  She knew already.  That's what I think happened. 
[01:13:30]  And I think it was over from that moment on.  She knew what we all found out later on with all these whores.  She knew.  By the way, look at the paper today.  Rachel Ukatel is falling the fuck apart.  Yeah.  Good.  She kind of looked sexy when she first came out.  Yeah.  She looks like shit.  Really?  Yes.  Where is the picture?  The hiv maybe?  What's she got?  Chlamydia?  Hopefully.  Yeah, I can only dream.  I don't know.  Ilan.  It's in the other paper if you want to see it.  Oh, here we go.  Look at this piece of shit. 
[01:14:00]  Did she really think Tiger was going to fucking leave his Swedish bombshell for that crap?  She's looking more like the Perkins waitress.  Horrible.  Let me see her.  Horrible.  No, that's not good.  Wow, that body is fucking...  There's a drop-off.  Well, there's a reason why she wears those Ray-Bans all the time, because she has fucking funny eyes.  She's five million now, though.  She doesn't care.  She got five?  Yeah, I think so.  She's got funny fucking eyes, though, man.  Kazowie.  So, Tiger and his wife are officially divorced. 
[01:14:30]  She got 100 mil.  100 mil, that's it?  Out of his five to 600 mil.  That's not that bad.  20%.  But, I mean, I think that's her payday, and then I would imagine there's some child support shit going on and all that, right?  Yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep.  I don't think he gave her 100 mil and said, take care of the kids.  I'm sure that's...  Future earnings.  I'm sure that's a separate deal.  Tiger Woods and E-Lynn were finally officially divorced yesterday in a very public swipe.  The former Mrs. Woods said in court papers she'd no longer be using Woods as her legal last name. 
[01:15:00]  Wow, she's like fucking done, done.  Because some of these broads, they get divorced, but they keep the name.  Yeah, tell me about it.  Some broads keep your last name.  Your broad kept your name?  Why wouldn't she?  Nah.  Yes.  But she fucking hates you.  Keep my name.  Who doesn't?  Give me my name!  She fucking despises you.  All the shit she's pulled.  And she fucking keeps your last name? 
[01:15:30]  No, she doesn't.  Who despises me?  You are lovable.  I am so lovable.  Now, I don't know why she's keeping it.  That's twisted.  And I even asked the lawyer, I was like, is there any recourse I have here to get her to  not have my name?  And he goes, no.  There really isn't anything you can do about it.  Why is she doing that, you think?  Can you talk about it or no?  No, I can assume that it's out of spite.  Yeah.  I would assume it's out of some type of spite.  I would have to agree with you on that.  But it's wearing somebody else's hat, a spiteful actor, it's almost like if I'm wearing your 
[01:16:00]  shirt and you've moved on, I'm just wearing your shirt like an asshole.  Yeah, it is kind of an asshole-y thing to do.  But I have no recourse, so it doesn't bother me.  People can take whoever's name they want.  Yeah.  Let's see what this is about.  So the split comes nine months, obviously, after the golf grade was exposed as a blah,  blah, blah.  The pair who have taken parenting classes, according to court documents.  How about he takes a putting lesson?  Yeah, right.  He needs that a little more. 
[01:16:30]  This motherfucker's going to start winning, though.  Oh, you think this is behind him?  Where's Travis?  Where's my golf fucking fan?  There he is.  This fucking guy had a horrible year.  Now I understand, because I lived alongside Anthony here when he was going through his divorce.  It's sort of a distraction for everybody.  It was a tad bit distracting for my life.  Now I understand that they were trying to get this divorce done quick, so he didn't have  time to really, really focus on the fucking golf.  Once it's done, you have a party, and then you're free. 
[01:17:00]  You breathe, and you move on, right?  You go, ah.  Yeah, he was distracted.  Off my shoulders.  I thought he was really done after having this shitty year that he had, but I think he  goes back to winning a few.  Yeah, you think maybe that the whole thing she was asking for, well, you know how it  is in something like that, the behind-the-scenes shit's driving you fucking sick.  Yeah, yeah.  There's nothing.  You know he was taking lawyer calls all day long.  All day long.  There's nothing that is, it's on your mind constantly. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  And I'm positive he was going through the same thing.  He's sitting there trying to make a putt, and he's just thinking, $1 million, $100 million,  this child support set.  Yeah, he's not going to be able to concentrate on the game.  He'll quit the game.  Yeah.  Shared parenting.  Elin, 30, never even said hello to Woods during the session.  Oh, what a bitch.  And she stayed far away from him, keeping with her eight lawyers.  She had eight lawyers.  Eight lawyers.  Eight lawyers.  Which you know he paid for.  Oh, my God.  That $100 million is probably more like $150 million. 
[01:18:00]  After all is said and done, everything he had to pay, all the legal fees, and then material  things that he probably had to give her.  You're just saying, right?  That were worth things.  I think that's just a cash deal that is like, here's what he had to give her in cash, but  there's so much other shit.  Legal fees.  Fucking here, I want this truck.  I want that house.  I need this.  And stupid Jamie fucking Jungers has to pop in.  Now that he's single, he's going to be out there twice as much. 
[01:18:30]  Is he?  I hate every one of his mistresses.  I hate them.  Although all just hose monsters.  She jumped on an interview immediately.  Of course she did.  Of course she did.  Trying to play.  When you've contributed nothing and nobody recognizes you for anything.  Except your vagina.  I want to know what the Perkins waitress is thinking.  Yeah, what is she thinking?  Hopefully, I wish I worked for Denny's.  I had a higher class job.  She's trying to get a better job, yeah.  Listen to this.  I mean, he was out there when he was married trying to play his game, said the former Las  Vegas hostess, who now deals blackjack. 
[01:19:00]  That's a big success story.  That's what Jamie Jungers is up to.  From black cock to blackjack.  Get it?  Because he's black.  That's funny in person.  I think he's probably more sad than anything else because of the kid situation.  Obviously, he didn't love her too much.  It's not true.  Maybe he did love her.  Yeah.  Maybe he just hated fucking her.  Maybe he had an issue with it because she became a mother.  Maybe he did love her.  Maybe he never had a chance to fucking grow up and it came out this way.  Maybe he wanted to just sink that big delicious penis into a bunch of gals. 
[01:19:30]  Of course he did.  Of course.  Joint statement by the two.  That's crap always.  Oh, the joint statement that the lawyers drew up.  You can imagine.  I'll read it.  It was an abacable.  We are sad that our marriage is over.  No, you're not.  And we wish each other the very best for the future.  No, you're not.  Bullshit!  She didn't even say hi to him in the court.  Stop.  She does not wish him the best.  Nope.  She wishes him herpes.  All those fucking... 
[01:20:00]  Dude, all of those fucking details.  The specificness of the night.  She knew the conversation they had and she's thinking,  after you said you love me, you motherfucker.  She knew where she was when things were happening.  Because the father died and that one pig said she had fucked Tiger that night.  It's like, boy, that wife remembers that talk.  She remembers that day.  Yeah, I thought it was weird.  He rushed me off the phone to cry and he was fucking that ugly girl.  I wondered why, after his father died, he was in the bathroom washing his cock.  Yeah. 
[01:20:30]  Seems an odd thing to do.  You can't blame Ilan on this one.  She got really humiliated.  I mean, that was a humiliation publicly.  That wasn't just one girl that he fucked.  A lot of people are saying, this has come out.  But I think Tiger had a shitty season because, obviously, his whole life got thrown upside down.  Topsy-turvy.  But this has made some of the sports blogs.  Go ahead, Corey.  I don't believe this anymore, by the way.  Go ahead.  I was wondering if maybe he just sucked because he wanted to not give her any more money before the divorce was final. 
[01:21:00]  No.  I don't think so.  What do you think?  What do you think?  It only goes this year?  Yeah.  That's less money than he has.  No.  You make whatever you can.  I was suspicious of that myself, but Tiger wins a couple tournaments, and that's a lot of fucking cash and more sponsors coming back, which he really wants to happen.  Wow.  Adam in Jersey has some breaking news there.  I didn't know this.  Really?  Go ahead.  Adam, what's up, man? 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  Jamie Junker is dealing blackjack now.  Really?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Watch out, please.  What's that?  I put your phone card out.  We heard you.  You didn't just fall for that.  How do you just fall for that?  What the fuck?  I was out of time.  Shut up.  What do our listeners listen for a minute a day?  Stop dealing us.  Stop dealing us shitty audio.  Speaking of blackjack.  Yes.  You listen for one fucking minute a day. 
[01:22:00]  Stop dealing us bunk.  All our tricks are right in front of your eyes, you dopes.  I'm going to surrender your call for half.  I'd like to split your call, please, between my ears and a pile of shit.  Let's go to David in Tennessee.  David.  Ah.  Morning, boys.  Yeah, whatever.  Tiger can start winning again now because he can go back to doing what he likes.  He can follow the advice of a former great golfer, Sam Steed, who said, if you're not thinking about pussy, you're not concentrating. 
[01:22:30]  Why would Tiger Woods say that?  Sam Steed said that.  Who the hell is Sam Steed?  Sam Steed.  I got it.  You heard me.  Guy's just trying to call.  I know.  I'm sorry.  Ah, fuck him.  Yeah, I think he'll start getting some pussy there.  That caller has a chode.  Now he can start fucking hanging out with pussy again, you know? 
[01:23:00]  I don't think the guy was hanging out with pussy.  You know what, though?  I don't think...  You think he can have that much pussy and be good at golf?  Was he doing that much pussy and good as he's juggling the wife and the pussy and the pussy?  He had bags under his eyes when he was winning all those tournaments because he was up all night doing his thing, I bet.  Hmm.  A lot of trips to Perkins.  I just realized Instant Feedback hasn't been on all day.  Aw, shit, yo.  I will figure that out after the break.  Sorry. 
[01:23:30]  Damn.  Listen to this logic for you, Anthony.  Matt in Atlanta.  Matt.  Hey there, Matt.  All right.  On Anthony's point, the reason my ex-wife received her last name is because she said there's too much trouble  switching back from changing all the credit cards and bank statements and stuff like that.  It's not.  Really?  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  What else does she have to do after a divorce settlement where she doesn't have to work anymore?  You go to motor vehicle, you fucking change your license to another name, and then you use that and change all your credit cards. 
[01:24:00]  That's all you do.  He's gone?  All right.  Yeah, fuck him.  Fuck him in his ass.  There you go.  That's what I say.  That's Tiger Woods.  He's done.  Done with that shit.  Done with that.  I don't know how they get these divorces, these high-profile, multi-million-dollar fucking divorces,  and I sat there for three fucking years with Dominic Barbera breathing down my fucking neck.  Three years to split up.  Three fucking years.  I had no kids.  I had no real estate. 
[01:24:30]  I didn't own a car.  I owned nothing except what was perceived as future earnings.  And if that idiot knew how fucking irresponsible we were, future earnings were nothing.  They continue to be nothing.  Of course they do.  Oh, God.  I wish I was paying that off now instead of back then.  No shit.  Cheaper to keeper.  Is it?  Not as much fun.  A lot of guys have to keep them. 
[01:25:00]  Cheaper to keeper.  Really?  Because it's just not fair for the guys out there in most of these divorce cases.  I know.  Every time we do this, a few women call up.  I understand.  But in general...  I'm the breadwinner.  Shut up.  In general, the guy gets screwed in divorce cases.  Yeah.  Screwed.  It happens.  In this case, though, I don't think anybody's bitching about it.  No one's saying, wow, Tiger got fucked in this one.  100 million out of 500 million.  He's still got 400 mil.  And then she did completely get humiliated and dragged through the mud. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  This was one of those weird cases where she didn't do anything wrong, at least as far as we know.  Yeah.  And man, every...  Can you imagine being publicly linked with someone?  And one or two instances bad enough, but the details, the days, the extent of it, the amount of people that knew that you were seeing at social functions and all these guys around him knew.  He's been going, oh, by the way, he's fucking this chicken.  Look at him.  That waitress.  She remembers meeting that waitress. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  She remembers that moment, the Perkins waitress, where, yeah, I thought she looked at Tiger weird.  Nah, nothing.  I'm crazy.  It's a Perkins waitress.  You know what it is?  When she delivered his eggs and sausage and the sausage was halfway down her throat.  And she just regurgitated it into his plate like a bird.  My friend Sean used to sing this song.  Ain't my mama pretty?  She got meatballs on her titties.  Scrambled eggs between her legs.  Ain't my mama pretty?  My friend Sean, when I was a kid, would sing that. 
[01:26:30]  That stinks.  I know.  Why would she have eggs?  Scrambled eggs.  Scrambled eggs.  Between her legs.  Yeah.  Because it rhymes.  Oh, okay.  But ain't his mama pretty?  I guess the areolas were meatballs on her titties.  Oh, meatball.  Ew, that would be disgusting.  Meatball titties?  That stayed with me.  You should have those checked.  That has stayed with me for 35 years.  It certainly has.  I wish it would leave.  Put a toe tapper.  Sure is.  We got some info on one of Tiger Woods' whores. 
[01:27:00]  What?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we got Rich in Long Island.  Or on Long Island.  I wish we got Rich in Long Island.  Rich.  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  How you doing?  I know I only wish we could about a minute a day, but did you know that Tiger Woods' girlfriend  is stealing blackjack and bacon?  Wow, really?  Smartass.  Eat that cold?  What a douchebag.  I hope you have to take one of the broken trains today.  As Otto would say, I hope your next shit is square.  I thought that was Jay Moore's line.  No? 
[01:27:30]  Jay Moore's.  Well, you know, let's just...  I don't know.  I don't know what to say.  Oh, it's indecisive, Jim.  Both sides of the fence, Jim.  Boy, Jim was coming off that fence that day.  Oh, did Jay save himself on that one.  I think Jimmy was going to hop down off the old picket fence.  I hate Facebook, by the way.  Why?  Do you?  I hate it.  Why?  It's just an impossible fucking thing to navigate.  Is it?  It sucks.  What's wrong with it?  I just go.  I go, boom. 
[01:28:00]  I look at the wall.  Boom.  Boom.  I check the messages.  Hey, what's up, dude?  Boom.  I'm doing it.  I'm drinking my coffee.  I'm Facebooking.  He's coming in today, Robert Kelly.  Oh, Bobby?  Is he?  Oh, good.  When?  He might be in now.  I have a crush on him soon.  Who doesn't?  Or, oh, I thought you meant he can crush you.  What do you mean, Anthony?  Yeah, what do you mean?  You know, I like soft-spoken Bob now.  You know, dude, there's times when you just kind of got, you got to think about your life  and what you do. 
[01:28:30]  It's fucking like the, the, just the soft-spoken deep Bob.  When he whacks his philosophical.  Yeah, yeah.  Not the, the, you know, dude, you got to get this.  You did.  That's, that's the, the, uh, action-packed on the air with the, the, the iPad talking at  you.  But then there's the, you know, the let me get to know you a little bit.  I'm like, you know, dude, there's certain times when you just, just shut it.  Bob.  What a maroon.  I love Poppy.  I do too. 
[01:29:00]  He'll be in in a few minutes.  He is a good egg.  Hey, fucking the Red Sox picked up Johnny Damon?  Off waivers?  Off waivers.  Isn't that fucked up?  Was he having a bad year?  I don't even know.  Ah, well, the Yankees got rid of him.  And then who was he with?  Tigers.  Big day, Monik.  Tigers, right?  What, was he having a bad year?  I don't even know.  I didn't pay attention to the Tigers.  So, who the fuck knows?  Tom Brady.  What did he do?  He fucking hates the Jets.  That's no surprise there.  Well, yeah.  Of course.  He fucking hates the Jets.  Of course he does. 
[01:29:30]  Well, that's breaking news, really.  Brady says he won't watch HBO's Hard Knocks because I hate the Jets.  Of course he hates the Jets.  Yes.  Why was that news?  Same fucking division.  Conference, really.  It'd be funny if that's why he wouldn't fly.  Huh?  Only propeller planes.  Yes.  Because of John Madden.  All right.  Is your life that important, John?  Exactly.  I know.  That gets me like...  Let me tell you something about John Madden.  He's fat.  And I know everyone's getting their fucking John Madden football. 
[01:30:00]  He used to live in our neighborhood.  And I have seen some miserable people in my life, including myself, when I look in the mirror.  But this guy would walk around the Upper West Side, miserable.  Yeah.  And I would watch him in these shitty food joints, eating the most shittiest of food.  And I'm thinking to myself...  He's got to stay fat.  He doesn't fly because he's scared to die, but he has no problem shoving fucking shit into his mouth.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:30:30]  If he was sitting there eating a salad or something, then I would understand his philosophy.  Get on a fucking plane!  I'm on the Madden Cruiser!  Oh, yeah, right.  Your big, stupid bus that takes forever to get somewhere.  I hope he's got roids.  He's just bouncing around on a bus all fucking day.  He's so not approachable, by the way.  No?  There's a lot of celebrities that walk around.  They're very approachable.  He is one of these guys.  I've never seen anyone approach him.  He looks like a leprechaun.  Like I said, I haven't seen him in a couple years now, but...  He does.  In Leprechaun, that movie. 
[01:31:00]  He looks like the fucking leprechaun.  You know what you call a black leprechaun?  He kind of just grunts to himself.  Same thing you call a black guy in the Flintstones?  In person.  No.  Same thing you call a black astronaut?  No.  No.  In person.  In person.  No.  Wasn't that mean?  Of course it wasn't.  But the logic, whatever.  The logic behind that is stupid.  Yeah.  Don't fly, but eat shitty.  Yeah.  I can.  I can.  What else is going on? 
[01:31:30]  Come in the ass.  I don't want to talk hockey.  It's too early for hockey.  It is too early.  What's up with A-Rod?  A-Rod's hurt.  Hurt again.  Hurt.  But I think the Yankees are killing without him.  They lost last night.  They put Cano in the cleanup spot, and he has been cleaning the fuck up.  Oh, really?  Grand slam the other day.  Fucking exciting.  They were 12-0 with A-Rod out.  12-0.  No way, really?  No shit.  Wow.  Don't you know? 
[01:32:00]  A Cano with a grand slam.  That was exciting, that one.  Wow.  Last night, I watched the opening of the game.  It was...  Get ready to broadcast, Jimmy.  New pitcher.  First game pitched as a Yankee.  Opening in Toronto.  First inning.  He lets the bases get loaded with no outs.  That's not the opener he was imagining when he became a Yankee. 
[01:32:30]  A pop fly to shallow left.  And who's the guy in left field?  Oh, he's got a great arm.  Threw a guy out at home.  Double play.  Next batter struck out, so he gets out of the inning.  Damn.  He lost the game 3-2.  But he did get bases loaded.  Nobody out.  His first inning, I believe.  And he fucking got out of it.  That was really impressive.  Unbelievable.  I don't remember the kid's name.  The kid.  The kid.  The little fucker.  What's that?  I heard you.  Yvonne.  Oh, Travis. 
[01:33:00]  Thanks, T-Dawg.  T-Dawg.  What's your name?  T-Storm.  T-Balls.  T-Balls.  T-Bag.  Whatever.  Yeah.  T-Balls.  Oh, he's got a new name.  Fucking T-Cell.  T-Cell.  Yeah, TV.  It's something like you're watching television.  It's TV, right?  Like Travis.  Hey, let's see.  Glenn in Florida.  Glenn.  Yo, what's up, buddy?  It's Glenn.  You know who I am.  Oh, Glenn Notice.  What's up, brother?  Maybe you don't want your last name on the radio.  I'm sorry.  My high school friend here. 
[01:33:30]  Oh.  What's up, Glenn?  That's all right, buddy.  How you doing?  Good.  Sweethearts?  What's up?  No, I actually wanted to bang his mom.  Oh, cool.  Wow.  The line was too long.  Glenn, you knew that.  He's the one I talk about.  I used to go over to his house because he had a hot mom.  I know, I know.  I know, I know.  No big deal.  Hey, John Madden may be a douchebag, but he claims to be claustrophobic.  What is a bust, though?  Again, it's a claim. 
[01:34:00]  I don't know.  He's a weirdo.  He's not claustrophobic enough to not squeeze into those tiny clothes of his.  Yeah.  If you're so claustrophobic, lose weight.  The walls will get further away from you.  Yeah.  The seat will give you a little more room on a plane.  Boom.  All right, man.  Hey, don't be a stranger.  You guys are great.  All right, Glenn.  Talk to you soon, buddy.  All right.  Be strange, but not a stranger.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Voice from the past right there.  Man.  We should do voice from the past day.  What is he, Harborfields?  Harborfields, yeah. 
[01:34:30]  Damn, Harborfields high.  Yeah.  His family and my family are very connected.  Yeah.  Very connected.  My sister is married to his cousin.  Oh, shit.  I went to school with his other cousin.  Oh, sounds a little southern.  A lot of connections.  What's going on there?  Fucking hate Facebook.  Oh, shit.  Sucks.  What's the scuttlebutt, Jim?  What is Facebook doing here?  It's impossible to control things in Facebook.  It's a fucking shit application.  Is it just on the iPad? 
[01:35:00]  No, I'm actually online.  Is it actually?  Yeah, really horrible.  Can you give me your iPad?  I'm a whiz at Facebook.  Oh, boy.  I'm a whiz.  People don't know that.  He's a whiz at whizzing the fucking iPad.  I'm a whiz.  The problem isn't the iPad on this one.  It's this fucking...  Just give me the iPad so I can do a few things for you.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That'll work.  With a shattered screen, it works even better.  Oh, Jimmy.  Stupid Facebook.  Yeah, what are you trying to do? 
[01:35:30]  Just fix it.  Let's take a break.  Fuck it.  Jimmy's disgusting.  I think we'll get Robert Kelly in next.  Where's he here?  Bobby!  I believe he's playing the Stress Factory.  Is he?  I believe so, yeah.  Go see Bobby.  He's very funny.  Down there in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  Vinny's Fine Comedy Club.  He gets a lot of tweets and stuff that just say, he saw you last night.  Oh, Bobby's killing.  Bobby's killing all over the fucking country now.  And he's going gill fishing, I think.  Oh, gill net fishing? 
[01:36:00]  Oh, gill netting.  Oh, fuck.  Isn't that one of those cruel type fishing you're not supposed to really do?  And I don't know.  We'll have him explain next.  And the situation is going to be a multi-fucking millionaire.  And I watched Jersey Shore.  I'm watching it this year.  Yeah.  I don't know what this guy does.  Maybe someone could explain it.  No.  He shows his stupid fucking abs and he's making millions.  I don't know what he does on the show.  I really don't.  He's an idiot.  And people love watching idiots.  Yeah.  A few of those guys are fans of the show. 
[01:36:30]  They follow us on Twitter.  Really?  Yeah.  He's a big dumb.  I don't think the situation does.  But I don't know what he does.  And he's the breakout star of the fucking show.  He's making millions.  Yeah.  Maybe Sam can explain it.  50 grand in appearance?  Yeah.  And am I jealous?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Imagine going to fucking an appearance and make it 50 grand.  Jesus Christ.  50 grand.  Ah, fuck.  We might as well do it now.  Amazing.  Where's all the numbers on the situation?  He's making 5 million this year.  He stands to make 10 million by this time next year. 
[01:37:00]  He gets 50, 60 G's an episode and 50 G's an appearance, I think.  Well, Jimmy, just shut the fuck up.  Because our resident expert on Jersey Shore and, of course, the situation is now in studio.  It's primetime Sam Roberts.  Sam!  Thank you for the introduction.  No problem.  But Mr. Norton, he's free to continue speaking.  No, no.  Oh, that's okay with you?  Shut it, Jim.  That's okay with you?  Sam knows everything.  Where's the numbers on the situation?  Because the 5 million is based on... 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, like endorsements.  Well, he's got what?  Vitamin water coming out or something like that?  He's got a workout tape.  A protein-infused vodka.  Oh, really?  What?  It's the first ever...  Like cum in vodka.  Which will be...  Who will be the first one from the Jersey Shore to OD?  That would be Ronnie.  Snooki.  Ronnie Chippity.  Snooki.  Snooki and her elephant ass.  It's going to be Ronnie.  Yeah, it's all fun and games now, but man, these fucking Jersey Shore people are heading 
[01:38:00]  towards some tough years.  Yeah, well, have you seen the way Ronnie gets wasted?  He really doesn't behave like he's just drinking.  Oh, really?  It's a little out of hand?  Oh, yeah.  He had a face plant on last week's episode.  Oh, really?  Face plant where his arms didn't even come out to help the fall.  One of those?  Wow.  That's fucked up.  Because we've all fallen down, but you managed to get your hands in front of you a little  bit.  Not even a clue that his hands were going to try to protect him.  There's certain rumors circulating that he's doing more than drinking on those episodes. 
[01:38:30]  What are the rumors saying?  Well, there are...  Cocaine.  That's right.  Cocaine's making a big comeback.  Oh, shit.  It really is.  Oh, yeah.  What's going on there?  Especially in that, like, Jersey Shore culture and everything.  I mean, especially in Miami.  Drugs really do kind of just make...  They go away.  Then they come back.  Cocaine's being popular.  Weed's always there.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Weed is always there.  But, like, Coke...  And then, like, people start snorting heroin.  Like, even if they're not shooting it.  Like, they'll just start snorting and then Coke is passe.  Yeah.  Coke is so 80s, though. 
[01:39:00]  No, the...  Because the 80s make it a comeback in a big way?  Drug-wise, yeah.  Yeah.  Because the It Girls in Hollywood are all doing Coke and it's starting to get back into hip-hop,  too.  It does get you skinny.  Yeah.  Yeah, it keeps you nice.  It keeps those abs.  I'm not making any, you know, assumptions here, but it will give you good abs.  So, explain to me what the situation does to deserve all this money.  Because I don't know what he does.  The sitch. 
[01:39:30]  That's what he calls himself.  But I watched Jersey Shore.  I don't even think he's talked yet in this season.  He's contributed maybe the single most important thing that's happened this season.  Pizza order?  No.  Well, that's probably second most.  All right.  Because that's why it's important.  All right.  Sam, I'm just...  I think the most important thing was introducing America to the concept of the shirt before the  shirt.  The shirt before the shirt.  Please elaborate.  Well, they did a whole thing on the show where the situation explained to his friends 
[01:40:00]  is that before you put your shirt on to go out, you walk around the house in like a  wife beater or something.  That's the shirt before the shirt.  So, all the guys are sitting around in the shirt before the shirt, having a drink, having  a sandwich, whatever.  Then they put on the t-shirt that they're going to wear when they go out.  Oh, because it's all nice then.  Right.  The shirt before the shirt.  Like, if I was walking around the house like this, like I took my shirt back in.  You're being sexy?  Just this white t-shirt?  Yeah.  This is the shirt before the shirt.  And then you put...  You can't have my real shirt, Danny. 
[01:40:30]  Danny went to steal his real shirt.  And then right before you go out, you go into the shirt you're going out in?  That way it stays nice and crisp and everything.  You have arms like Karen Carpenter's corpse.  All right.  Well, that wasn't the...  There's nothing there.  Just trying to...  Let me see your biceps.  I just...  Oh, God.  Okay.  I was trying to flex.  Yeah, I was...  That's not bad.  That's not bad.  It's like indented.  You have a concave muscle.  You have chode arms.  Chode.  It actually went in. 
[01:41:00]  Look, look.  It goes in.  There's something right here.  It dips down where it's supposed to go up.  What's going on?  I'm doing coke.  Maybe you should work out a little, you know?  He runs.  I run.  They go to the gym.  You run?  Yes.  Oh, so what?  You got good legs?  That's the one thing you don't need to do.  You're thin enough.  No, no, no.  Running is good.  Running is...  You know why?  Because if I bulk up and then I don't keep up with the regimen, then that muscle turns  to fat.  What are you, Hulk?  And now I'm screwed. 
[01:41:30]  You got years.  You got years.  You're a kid.  You can fucking work out and maybe get, you know, get a little meat on your bones, as  they say.  A little meat on your bones.  I'm much more interested in a cardiovascular regimen.  Are you?  Is that it?  Yes.  Are you?  Bad history?  What's the matter?  No.  Drinking all that buttermilk, you're afraid?  Getting nervous?  I just think that running is a good full body workout.  So did Jim Fix until he dropped dead doing it.  Yeah, he fucked it up for everybody.  He certainly did.  Running enthusiast.  You know that?  All those books he put out? 
[01:42:00]  Great.  He dropped dead running.  Wonderful.  Fucking asshole.  So why the situation is, why is he going to make $5 million?  What does he do?  He's got the two workout tapes.  Are we just too old to understand?  I'm starting to worry about that.  He just...  I watch the show.  Sorry.  What does he do?  He's got his influence on pop culture.  Nobody's been able to come out with catchphrases like the situation, like the shirt before the shirt.  See, let me slow you down a little bit.  Like with Snooki, I don't like Snooki, but I understand what she does for the show. 
[01:42:30]  She gives good TV.  She really does.  Ronnie's giving good TV with his face fucking plants.  Sammy Sweetheart giving good TV, being the loser fucking girlfriend, thinking that Ronnie's doing the right thing when he's at those fucking clubs.  See, I watched the show.  And then JWoww with her fake, I'm going to beat everyone up bullshit.  Yeah.  I've never seen the girl punch anyone, but every episode she's threatening somebody.  When is she going to start hitting somebody?  She hit the situation, season one.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It was like a little fucking slap. 
[01:43:00]  It was a spin punch.  Spin punch or whatever.  The situation is the only one who has created a brand.  Yeah.  Oh, so he's got like a brand.  What's the brand?  The situation is the brand.  See, people didn't get good enough names.  Although Snooki has a name, but she's not able to market it.  She's not a brand, though.  She's just Snooki.  The situation is a brand.  But if someone said Snooki's going to make five million, it pains me to say this, but I would understand.  What?  I would understand, yeah, because that's just what pop culture is all about.  Yeah, that's true.  But the situation, he goes out.  He puts his sunglasses on sideways as he's looking at girls, and he says nothing. 
[01:43:30]  And then he shows his abs, and then I have to read the paper, it's going to make well  over five million next year.  But that's the best part, too.  When he's doing interviews now, they ask him to show his abs, and he won't do it.  Oh, really?  Why?  Because he says he has to be careful how often he does it.  You know why he won't do that?  Oh, overexposure.  Too many fucking vodka drinks in the house.  That's why he won't do it.  I thought he was protecting the brand.  Yeah, protecting the brand.  Yeah.  He doesn't give it away for free.  No.  And that's what it is. 
[01:44:00]  Nobody else's...  That's his move.  He dips his glasses a little bit.  He dips the glasses down.  Hey, yo, ah!  Also, he's apparently going to be on Dancing with the Stars.  Why?  Which is a big...  I've been doing this shitty job since I was 18.  He's striking while the eye is hot.  And you have a beautiful stomach.  Yeah.  You've fucked that up forever.  I never had a good fucking...  Why?  Because I mentioned it last night on national television?  Did you?  I know.  I haven't seen it yet.  I never had fucking abs.  Jimmy killed me forever.  Oh, you're getting a little soft there. 
[01:44:30]  No, I was always fucking soft.  I never said you were getting soft.  In that area.  I said you had a V.  I don't have anything close to a V.  Never did.  What does this situation do to get those abs?  GTL.  Every day.  But GTL won't give you...  Gym.  Tanning.  Then tan laundry.  But the gym is the part that gets the abs tanning to make them look so good.  And then laundry just to stay fresh.  Uh-huh.  I don't get it.  For the first time, I don't get it.  Well, think about it. 
[01:45:00]  When we listen to the old Opie radio tapes, you said you were always trying to make a catchphrase, right?  Yeah.  My catchphrases were just as good as these horse shitphrases.  Brother man, brother man.  I should have a brother man, brother man vodka.  Brother man, brother man vodka.  Would you say brother man, brother man twice?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  No.  Because anyone can say brother man.  Brother man, brother man vodka.  No.  Except you never had...  Coming soon.  Shirt before the shirt.  Shirt before the shirt.  Right.  Motherhucka oysters. 
[01:45:30]  Why not?  Naked cowboys got fucking oysters.  I could have fucking oysters.  I've never seen it.  I've heard him talk about his oysters.  I've never seen naked cowboy oysters anywhere.  Someone tweeted a picture of a van on Long Island that says naked cowboy fucking oysters.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  But wait.  I want brother man, brother man vodka.  Nobody would drink that.  Would you like some brother man?  We would run out of absolute at the house.  No, I'm not.  I'll mix it with some cranberry.  Hey, can I get you some brother man?  No.  You say no before the second brother man comes out? 
[01:46:00]  Before the first one.  Would you like some brother man?  No.  What if it was brother man, brother man malt liquor?  No.  No.  Well, the brothers might like that.  The brothers enjoy some brother man, brother man malt liquor?  That might be.  They might feel like they were being talked down to.  Look at the worst mustache ever on TV right now.  Is that real?  That is giant.  Wow.  Is that fucking real?  How do you grow that?  Is that real?  If that curled up, that would be my dad's mustache.  Wow.  Sorry.  So the situation.  So he branded himself.  And he's got his book coming out.  A book.  Yeah.  What kind of book is this? 
[01:46:30]  It's like a how-to.  How to what?  Be the situation.  Is it like a man's guide to a man's man being a man?  It's the situation's version of a guy's guide to being a man's man.  To being a man's man.  Yeah.  But so he's got his book, his vodka.  He's got his ab workout videos coming out.  He's got Jersey Shore.  He's got, you know, two seasons worth that he's doing this year.  Dancing with the Stars.  Do people realize he's like Puck with muscles? 
[01:47:00]  Puck was way more talented than Puck.  He was, though.  But Puck didn't brand himself, though.  If we're talking about talent between these two guys, Puck was way above the situation.  As far as talent goes?  That guy said some great shit.  Yeah, but Puck didn't know how to handle his business because he was out after three episodes.  Right.  The situation is trying to cash in as much as possible.  He's not a dummy.  If Puck had cashed in and gone a little more easy so he could have stayed on the show, 
[01:47:30]  he could have been a bigger star.  Now he's still a bike messenger.  The situation's not going to be caught doing that.  No, sir.  No, no, he's got a bright future.  Shirt before the shirt.  Shirt before the shirt.  Look.  Well, I got brother man, brother man vodka.  How long do you give?  How long do you give the situation?  It's going to be a flavored vodka, too.  How long do you give the situation before it's completely over?  If he does Dancing with the Stars, that's another fucking year.  He's got a good five years.  No way.  He's going to be around for a while because he seems like a smart dude.  Like, he's not. 
[01:48:00]  You know, I know it's silly what he does and his dumb expressions and his abs,  but he's been smart enough to fucking build it.  He might have just good people behind him.  But he doesn't have anything.  He's got a song and his bobble head.  Exactly.  He doesn't have a marketable talent.  I'll tell you what it is.  Like singing or anything like that.  We all want to fuck him.  It's just something to do about it.  He's just an entertaining guy.  Like, he's just one of those guys that's, you know, he's a bit of a boob,  but it's entertaining.  There's something about a guy going, hey, the shirt before the shirt. 
[01:48:30]  You're like, what an asshole.  But he's not on the watch.  And he knows he's an asshole, so he's going to keep doing it.  Yeah, let's look back then and think about people like Richard from Survivor.  Richard Hatch.  He was in the news all the time.  He was getting, like, endorsements and things, whatever.  Richard Hatch is the guy from Battlestar Galactica.  Yeah.  They have the same name.  That's the other one.  And then there's other reality show stars that were giant.  Jerry Shepard. 
[01:49:00]  Fairplay.  What?  Johnny Fairplay.  Johnny Fairplay's still working, and he has way more talent than the situation, too.  As far as that world goes.  He's not nearly as in the public eye as he was when...  Do you watch Jersey Shore?  I've seen one episode.  I don't really...  You should check it out.  Go back to my original point.  I don't know what he does.  Except he has a cool name.  And?  I mean, some people would say.  I don't know.  And what does he wear?  Somebody slipped up.  Shirt before the shirt.  I don't know if it's a cool name.  Shirt before the shirt.  Got the shirt before the shirt, and he's going into clubs. 
[01:49:30]  And he got the gel.  Or gym.  Laundry.  No, gym.  Tanning.  Tanning.  TTL.  And laundry.  Plus MVP.  What's MVP?  Mike Vinnie Pauley.  When the guys go out.  MVP night.  Mike Vinnie Pauley.  Look.  I hate these motherfuckers.  Why?  I don't know.  Because they're getting pussy all over the place.  And money.  Yeah.  You know, I don't watch it because I don't need to watch TV to see these people.  That's true. 
[01:50:00]  Like, I know these people, and I've hung out with them at bars.  And I don't want to.  And there's a reason why I don't anymore.  So I'm not going to fucking watch them on television.  I know them.  That's what I was saying.  It's like, did you ever hear?  It's pissy.  I was like, I was saying the same thing last night.  It's like, you drive around Jersey, it's not fun and exciting.  It is.  It's not this big, wow, I'm hanging out with this one.  You're with annoying fucking people.  The guys, the girls, they're fucking annoying on the Jersey Shore.  They had to go to a black barbershop to make sure, because nobody 
[01:50:30]  in Miami knew how to cut hair like they do in New York.  That is totally scripted, and they came up with, look, why don't we send  you guys to a black barbershop?  You think that, no.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  Just reality.  No.  Yes.  No.  Yes.  Revolving Monk on Twitter.  I'm hungry for some delicious Spuds Buckley barbecue potato chips.  Ah, shit.  See if you have branded.  I'm going to be branding my ass off in the next year.  Spuds Buckley and the Spuds and potatoes.  That's right.  Goes together.  Brother Man, Brother Man Vodka, though.  I'm telling you.  I can see the shirt now.  But Spuds would have to come back on the show. 
[01:51:00]  What's the big flavor of vodka that people are drinking?  Shit.  Spuds Buckley shit flavor vodka.  Brother Man, Brother Man Vodka.  Try it with one Brother Man.  It doesn't work.  Brother Man Vodka?  No.  Brother Man, Brother Man Vodka.  It should be all awful flavors, like Brother Man, Brother Man Armpit Vodka.  Brother Man, Brother Man Shaving Stubble Cake.  Just ruining my brand.  I can see the label, though, on the vodka.  Like, one Brother Man, and then the other one's slightly offset from it. 
[01:51:30]  That's right.  A little lower.  And in the middle, there's some kind of...  Because you're drinking Brother Man, Brother Man Vodka.  How would you say it, though?  Like, how would it come up?  Like, I don't know how...  I couldn't...  Very excitedly, like I'm doing.  No, but I mean, in what context?  Like, when you were talking to Ant, or when you were talking to a caller, or when you  were just...  How would you bring that up?  What do you mean?  Like, if I...  I'm like, what do you mean?  No, but how does it...  Like, had it, like...  On the air.  On the air.  How would it come up?  Yeah.  Next phone call sponsored by Brother Man, Brother Man Vodka.  No, how would you have said it when you were doing it?  When you used it?  Like, when... 
[01:52:00]  Back on AAF.  What?  What context would you use it?  I wasn't there when you used it.  I'm trying to remember, too.  Oh, how I used Brother Man.  How was it used on the show?  I don't know.  Because you're goofing about it now.  I'm trying to remember.  Would you go to a caller and go, uh, Sam, you're on the air.  Brother Man, Brother...  How would you...  Oh, no.  I never said Brother Man, Brother Man.  I'm just fucking upping it so it sounds good for the product.  Brother Man, Brother Man Vodka.  But I used to...  That is smart.  Instead of saying dude or whatever, I would say thanks, Brother Man.  Brother Man, Brother Man.  Yeah, I wasn't excited about it.  It was just basically, hey, thanks, Brother Man, for the call. 
[01:52:30]  Something like that.  You gotta get excited about it.  But there was the dual Brother Man.  When?  Like, I think it was during the opener of a show.  I don't think I ever did Brother Man, Brother Man until today.  I'd be like, hey, Hope, how you doing?  And you'd go, Brother Man, Brother Man, how are we doing today?  Maybe I don't.  No, you wouldn't.  I just like seeing Jim's teeth itch.  Maybe, maybe, though.  Find a tape.  Maybe.  Find a tape.  I don't know, to be honest with you.  Google it.  Google it.  You gotta get excited about it.  That's the key.  That's right.  I'm all in with Brother Man, Brother Man Vodka.  If people say it's stupid, even better. 
[01:53:00]  Because they'll be upset.  Who wouldn't want to watch somebody saying Brother Man over and over again?  Now, someone who couldn't wait around with the situation to keep it sort of serious,  they're saying that he's not really getting wasted this season on Jersey Shore because  he knows where he's at now in his career.  Ah, he can't fuck up.  While Snooki and the rest of them are getting fucking snodded.  And sure, I was going to say, he's the rock of the house this season.  Well, that would be smart right there.  At least it goes back to whoever said that he's actually a smart guy.  Yeah.  He understands that him, you know, slurring and falling all over the place in the clubs  is not going to help his market. 
[01:53:30]  We both saw the episode where he and Pauly D went out and got the girls to come back to  the hot tub and he was, right, he was a little tipsy and he splashed water on his face.  And what was there?  Grenades.  Grenades.  Give me a question.  I can answer any question about Jersey Shore.  And what are the grenades?  And what was a landmine?  Grenades are the girls that come over to ruin everything, right?  Right.  Like, so you have to throw yourself on top of a grenade so your boy can't hit her.  It's like when we were growing up, you stuck the fat pig so you're trying to get some  ass.  It's a wingman. 
[01:54:00]  Right.  But a landmine, that's like a fat grenade.  It's like an overweight grenade.  Grenade is a landmine.  It's a landmine.  A grenade could just be just ugly.  Yeah, yeah.  Grenade's just like an ugly chick, like not up to our standards.  Nice.  Not up to the MVP standards.  MVP, right.  Mike Vinnie Pauly.  Of course.  What else would it be?  Because Ronnie is doing his own thing.  He's crazy.  No, he's not.  Is he crazy?  He's just getting fucked up.  Is he really, Sam?  Yeah.  Is he really?  Yeah.  He went home after the first season and everyone laughed at him, all his boys, and said, 
[01:54:30]  Ah, you're pussy whipped.  What's wrong with you, man?  The rest of your boys are getting pussy all over the place.  So he goes, oh yeah, well, look what I do for season two.  It's so obvious.  Just getting drunk, making out with ugly chicks, and then going home and sleeping with the same  girl from season one.  The fact is he doesn't want, he just wants to be with that chick, but he felt the pressure  from his boys.  Yeah.  See, that's the situation.  Absolutely.  He doesn't feel pressure.  He's creating a brand.  He's going to make five million bucks.  That's my boy.  Well, he's something else.  Does he name his STDs like he names his fucking abs and stuff? 
[01:55:00]  I don't think the situation has any of those.  Who the fuck knows?  I don't know either, but that'd be funny if he named his STDs.  Sitch.  Sitch.  Sitch.  That's how he used to end his text messages when he would still text Steve back, dash  Sitch.  Sitch.  When did he stop texting us back?  I mean, after the first episode.  Really?  When, uh, when, uh, we had all these guys in our back pocket, when JWoww and Snooki were  up here, uh, and you guys were on vacation and I interviewed him, JWoww goes, Liam goes, 
[01:55:30]  it's Sam.  He's, uh, with the Opie and Anthony show.  He's going to be interviewing with you guys.  And they're like, oh, hey.  And JWoww goes, Opie and Anthony, I know those guys.  And then I go, yeah, yeah.  And she was like, you guys were, were emailing me before.  And I was like, yeah, I'm like the beginning of the first season.  And she goes, yeah, I had to change my email address.  And I go, because of us?  Yeah, because Steve C., I guess, was one stop email.  Oh, over email.  Hello.  You're kidding, right? 
[01:56:00]  So she said that she, if you made JWoww change your email address, according to Sam.  Yes.  I never email.  You have a private message on Foundry.  I never.  You want to be a, uh, a cam girl?  Well, I've given you your own Foundry email address.  Would you wear an Opie and Anthony shirt in one of my videos?  Put this Wow sticker on your chest.  Oh, my God.  How many times did you email her?  I never emailed her once.  Texted her, probably 30.  Oh, why?  Because I was doing my fucking job. 
[01:56:30]  And I was trying to get her on the goddamn show.  Let's do some sexting.  Do you know a guy?  Yes.  Did you ever see the situation's abs?  And she was actually one of the coolest ones that responded.  You got something to this?  She was so cool, she changed her email address.  Yeah, wow.  You couldn't get in here fast enough.  You rock.  Um, it was actually, she had to change her phone number, and Steve said that, uh, MTV probably  told them all that they're not allowed to respond to him anymore, because he was over-texting  them so much. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, my God.  It's absolutely, I would, I would absolutely say that.  But, that's not going to get the job done.  That'll, that would never get the job done.  Steve.  Mission accomplished.  I think the fact that I was texting them directly and not going through the proper protocols  pissed off the MTV people.  I think people would keep their numbers.  Yeah, J-Won said she had to change it, because she kept getting harassed.  Kept getting this fucking text from this guy, Steve.  It's like, okay, well, let me just start asking questions before she cancels the entire  thing.  Unbelievable. 
[01:57:30]  Wow.  All right.  LOL.  Well, uh, Bobby.  OMG.  Why don't you come on the show, LOL?  Yes.  Bobby is, uh.  L-M-A-O.  Lazy-ing my ass off.  I thought you left.  I thought you were lazy.  No, you didn't.  No, you didn't ask me.  Ah, I thought you walked out.  Ah.  That's funny.  Poor word.  Smiley face.  A frowny face.  Yeah.  Over-texting. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, he's going to touch you, too.  Oh, wow.  A little colon with an O.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Over-texting.  Oh.  Ah, shit.  Over-texting.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Over-texting.  Can't over-text.  No, there's no such thing.  No, you just, you, yeah.  Apparently there is such thing.  Oh, we changed your number.  Anyways, Boogie and VA on Twitter with underscore, so good luck having people follow you. 
[01:58:30]  Brother man, brother man, watermelon vodka.  Okay.  Ah, watermelon vodka.  Watermelon vodka.  I think that tastes good.  People might see through that, especially.  I know my market.  If they see a picture of the person who owns the brand, yeah.  Hey, man, I'll put someone front and center.  Just put a minstrel singer on the fucking label.  Grammy vodka.  I'll put black girl as the fucking spokesperson for brother man, brother man, watermelon vodka.  Oh, God.  Why not?  He'll be my Dave Thomas. 
[01:59:00]  That's what I want the label to look like.  A guy in dreads eating watermelon in some fucking hovel.  Why not?  A hovel.  Living a hovel.  I don't know if you thought this brand out as well as the situation has.  Yeah, yeah.  Protein-infused vodka.  It's like being at the gym and at the club.  Yeah, you're fucking, you're drinking and working out.  What am I doing?  Fist pumping or exercising?  Ah, you're fist pumping.  What's the difference now?  What's the difference?  What is it?  That's right.  Ah, fist pump. 
[01:59:30]  You gotta start low, though, right?  You start low because you gotta beat that beat up.  Let me see.  Start low.  You start low.  Yeah.  And then you start going higher and higher and higher until you're all the way in the sky.  Boom, boom, boom.  And then you jump in.  And what happens?  The chicks just fucking start sucking your dick?  The chicks go crazy because you're fighting that beat.  You know what I'm saying?  Is that what you're doing?  Is that what the fist pump is about?  Like you're fighting back against the beat.  Like you're fighting with the beat.  That's DJ.  I hope the beat wins.  Oh.  Because that is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.  The fist pump. 
[02:00:00]  DJ Pauly D's song is Beat That Beat Up.  Beat That Beat Up?  That's DJ Pauly D's single.  What are they going to do?  Guy's doing fucking push-ups into a watermelon naked.  He's fucking a watermelon by doing push-ups into a watermelon.  Hey, what happens with the Jersey Shore?  They start phasing these dudes out so they have a real-world situation with new people coming in.  Because you can't watch the same people over and over again.  I didn't think season two would be good with them and it's fucking bigger than CD8.  Oh, I know.  It's going to last.  Well, they're going for a third.  Well, season three is filming now and Angelina was already replaced. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, so they already brought in a new broad.  So do they start bringing in new people here and there?  Well, the sitch has to fucking stay.  Yeah.  The sitch is like I said the rock.  Got it.  Chip-a-D.  What's up, guys?  Oh, wow.  That would be good.  Just get Chip.  Fist pumping.  I'll have the whole place cracking up.  Be in the hot tubs.  That's why they call us a cold tub.  It's not hot.  You know, whatever I say.  Are you my house?  Yeah, my good.  Oh, I got to do something with Blackberries, too. 
[02:01:00]  Blackberries.  Oh, right.  Oh, Blackberry is already a brand.  Who's that with Snooki?  Not how I say it.  Her dad?  That's her dad.  That's a proud moment right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Snooki.  Snooki.  Snickers.  What?  That's like their name.  Snickers.  They're calling her Snickers?  That's where they started season one because they didn't really remember her name.  Oh, he's wearing a shirt that says Papa Snooki?  No, he doesn't.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  She looks like...  How much attention do you need?  She looks like a beanbag chair with a head. 
[02:01:30]  Oh.  She is despicable.  She's horrible.  Sir, you gave birth to a fucking...  To an embarrassment.  Just a professional whore.  A big star.  A whore.  Sam is right.  You know what?  Didn't she try to fuck Vinny?  She just rolls over and goes, do you want to fuck?  Really?  You know who's going to fuck Vinny?  Bob when he's at the Stress Factory.  This weekend.  Yeah, let's get to Bob.  September 30th and October 2nd.  All right.  We're going to go to break with a little mashup that Danny found. 
[02:02:00]  Thanks for the fucking Jersey Shore update there, Sam.  My pleasure.  Get the fuck out of here.  Danny, what's this mashup about?  You really like this one.  We're going back to mashups a little bit, huh?  Well, you know what?  They've been popping up here and there.  This one's pretty cool.  It's Johnny Cash and Easy E.  Wow.  Easy E?  Yeah, you wouldn't think it would go well, but it does.  Is it a popular Easy E song?  You know what?  I was never into them, so I don't know the Easy E's.  I fucking love the Easy E's.  I fell into a burning ring of AIDS.  And it burned AIDS.  A little mashup as we go.  I'm Johnny Cash. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, yeah.  Let's take a trip.  Just sit back and light a spliff with this.  And don't slip on a funky coke track.  Jump back.  Strapped with a fat cul-de-sac in a 7-8 black.  Don't clean.  Gangsta lean.  I got three.  But I serve dubs like it ain't no thing.  I hang with old key players.  Don't set trip for you.  Might get what we call the rat pack.  I don't slack when it come to street.  I get real cheap funk to a gangsta beat. 
[02:03:00]  It's so sweet.  When you got money to spend, I got a proper big tilt.  Then I fly big bands.  I make games.  Spend my dough.  I'm no foe.  That's how it is.  And that's how it goes.  Act like you know when I creep real slow.  Giving love to them players that I know is real cheap.  When I was just a baby, my mama told me, son, always be a good boy.  Don't ever play with guns.  But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die.  When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry. 
[02:03:30]  Dumped up on fools with a quickness.  And they got no cure for this sickness.  I get paid for the way that I kick this.  My dinner and no cheese stuff.  A hooch day.  A real playin' ain't easy.  And I live life straight crazy.  Don't need no punk fools payin' me.  And bro groupies and hoochies don't faze me.  I take two steps back and release myself.  The good part of men go on a record show. 
[02:04:00]  I don't brag, but I tell it like it's straight up is.  Before you do a record part, I'll handle your business.  And don't get caught sippin' over under.  Or you might wonder.  What's up on a man, G?  I call a spade, a spade, and get paid.  G showed the way, so I give love to him.  When I was just a baby, my mama told me, son, always be a good boy.  Don't ever play with guns.  But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die. 
[02:04:30]  Hear that horse bull blowin'.  I hang my head and cry.  You see, why must I taste the cat and be a dog, a straight-up hawk?  I lead frog to the sound of a gangster beat  So I can hear my record bumpin' on the comp the street  That O-G-B-I-M-P-N-L-O-G-N-L-O  Hip-hop thugs are so quick to run straight to the dirt  Fool, I do work  Nobody move, nobody get hurt  That's how it is when it comes to me 
[02:05:00]  Cause I feel short but wicked  Playin' ain't easy  Women can't play me  Some say I'm crazy  But I don't think so  Call me pure and loco  I can sit down by the scan this trick  Let me hit it one time  The tricks that's it  But don't trip  Gets my dough to no fold  That's how it is  I got no love for ya  When I was just a baby  My mama told me, son, always be a good boy  Don't ever play with guns  But I shot a man in Reno  Just to watch him die 
[02:05:30]  When I hear that whistle blowin'  I hang my head and cry  If you got love for them games  Let me hear you one time  If you dare but cry  If you got love for them hustlin'  Let me hear you say ho  If you make a straight tone  If you got love for them players  Let me hear you say ooh ladies we want you  If you got love for them straight G's  If you want to be there just free  And now

October 2nd  Oh fuck  We got a month  We're a month out  Alright  Yeah  I got to  I want to start by 
[02:07:30]  I follow you on Twitter  And you went gill net fishing  I saw the video  You little twit vid  Yeah  On a boat  Yeah  Sun's coming up  Crazy  Now isn't this like a thing  That's very cruel  And people do not like  Gill net fishing  Yeah what's gill net fishing  Loose lips sink ships  Anthony  Right  And that's fucking true  Yeah huh  Is it?  That's true  What do people like about it?  Well you just throw a net out there  It's a very cruel way to fish  There's actually things that they have to do  To make it so that certain things can get out of the net 
[02:08:00]  So it's humane that they're being hooked by their lungs  Yeah that's what I mean  Like their gills  Not lungs  Their gills  Well it's their lungs  It would be like you inhaling a net  And it getting stuck in your lung tissue  And then someone pulling you out of the oxygen into the water  To eat you  That's not even the worst  You see when they come on the boat  Yeah  Yeah  They can't breathe  He's trying to breathe right?  He can't breathe  Yeah  You get a hammer  To the front of their heads 
[02:08:30]  Oh is that how you get him a  And there's a hole in his head  Clunk  And then when you gut a cod  You have to reach in  You cut him open  Take the stuff out  Reach in  Grab his gills  Bend his head down  And rip the gills out  While it's still alive?  Look how fucking disgusting that is  Such a fucking piece of shit sport man  It's not a sport  It's a valve  Whatever it is  It's not sport  It's the catching fish  So you can go to your fancy restaurant  And have fucking haddock  With butter  Asshole  Asshole 
[02:09:00]  You catch  My little brother's a fisherman  He goes out every day  Seven days a week  They wake up at three in the morning  Go down to the dark  It's dark  This guy jumps on this big fishing boat  You can't even see  And he just plows  I mean right through the harbor  And this boat's like  This guy's been doing  Two feet away right  Not even a foot  Like a half a foot away  He's just going  This guy smokes 90 packs a day  The captain  He's the best guy I ever met  Wow  They almost hit each other right there 
[02:09:30]  Oh yeah it's crazy  He's not the best guy you ever met  That's um  I'm a better guy than he is  That's um  I don't murder things  Yeah you do  Just slowly  You have to take a cocktail  I  Did you drink my water  No I would never drink your water  It has an X on it  Mark it Jimmy  Mark it  Mark the cap  Yeah he has an X on it  Jimmy marks the cap  Yeah this guy  It's pretty crazy  I mean it's the hard  One of the hardest jobs I ever did  What dropping a net in the water  Waiting for something to choke itself  No no no no no  They  Choke yourself 
[02:10:00]  God damn it with my net  We were catching dogfish  Which is basically a mini shark  Yeah  Okay it's like a three foot  Four foot shark  At seven feet  That's what uh  That's what uh  The uh  When the uh  Oh my god  The uh  When the uh  The uh  The uh  He threw me off for a second  I'm sorry sweetie  He um  That's what the fish and chips is in England 
[02:10:30]  That's what they eat  Yeah  It's a dogfish  It looks like a fucking shark  We don't eat it here  Cause we're  We're fucking  We don't eat bullshit that the world eats  What's this guy going around in circles like  He looks like he's gonna run his own head over  No that's crazy shit  That's not it  That's to make the fish dizzy  Before he cuts their gills out  That's some fucked up shit that they do  It looks like he's gonna run his own net over though  No they do a big circle around where the fish are  Trap them  And then haul them up real quick  Oh so they scare the fish into the net  No  That's some weird shit  What we do is you go out  You leave the net out there for a couple days  Soak like the crab fishing  Oh yeah  And then you go out  You leave out like ten nets 
[02:11:00]  And they're fucking  Fathoms  I think there's six feet in a fathom  So there's ten fathoms on each net  There's like ten nets together  You can't fathom that  There you can  It's six feet kid  Fathom it  And then  Can we see the fathom of the operas  Oh chip  I fucking hate chip  How the fuck you get the nets in  Don't they get all tangled up  Yeah cause they're probably gonna be playing a game  Well they bring up the net  They literally just haul it up  And then they  It just  Clumps of net with thousands of fish  And your job is to take this little hook 
[02:11:30]  And get the fish out of the net  But there's  Dude what comes up in a net  Is like crazy shit  Like there's lobsters  There's crabs  There's fucking  Cows  Monk fish  You ever see a monk fish  No they look scary  Totally  A fucking monk fish is  A creature double feature  That shit is  Really  It's fucking Godzilla dude  Scary looking shit  Right  It's  It's  It's  Poor man's lobster  They usually use it  It tastes just like  It has the same consistency of lobster  Poor people don't deserve lobster 
[02:12:00]  Let them eat dirt  It's a theme today  It's a  It's a theme  The monk fish is  And they bite  I got bit by one  It bit my glove  Thank God my pinky finger's small  And it didn't fit the whole glove  Fuck  Cause it  It bit the top  Really  Yeah  Not your finger  I don't have man hands  That fit the fisherman's glove  Right  How much of this shit  Do you throw in a garbage pail  You don't throw it right over the sea  And there's like a million seagulls  Following the boat  Yeah so it's a shitload of dead stuff  Just to get the good stuff 
[02:12:30]  Anything that's  Anything that's bad  Or cut open  Like  Aren't these nets illegal in some places  Yes  Like where humane people live  No I'm serious  I think they are  I think so  I don't know  I don't know  I know what you guys were doing  Was legit  But I believe  These nets are illegal  Holy shit  Did you see it  Monkfish are fucked up looking  Dude I caught a hundred pound monkfish  We caught a hundred pound monkfish  In the net  They're that big  Dude that is scary looking  Fucking huge  Yeah I haven't seen a monkfish in a while  I know they're scary looking  Inside of the fucking monkfish's mouth 
[02:13:00]  Is another mouth  Yeah look at his shit  I'm looking at it  You can eat them though  They're good  It tastes like lobster  Yeah  The inside of his mouth  Looks like a  Diseased vagina  It does  It's fucked up right  Would you let a monkfish  Suck your cock  It's like a fucking alligator  His teeth are all like  Fucking pin cushions  They go backwards  So you can't pull your hand  Out of its mouth  Yeah well the trick is  Not to put it in  Its mouth I guess  Dude there's a big  Fucking clump of net  Right  It just comes up  And you  You gotta work as fast as you can  Because he keeps bringing net up 
[02:13:30]  So you're ripping fish out  And you don't know  What the fuck's under  It's just a big clump of net  With shit in it  And you're trying to find a fish  So is the net all tangled  Yeah but there's a guy  At the end with the shit job  It's gonna get the crabs  And the net  And fix the net  I don't know how it fucking works  If you  You have to see it work  To know  That sounds crazy  It's crazy dude  It sounds like too much work  Dude it's fucking ridiculous  And it's probably stinky  It's smelly  And I almost puked  The  Ugh  The fish die  And little 
[02:14:00]  Oh this is the worst thing ever  The dogfish  When they die  They get them on board  They're all alive  You throw them in a  Like just thousands of them  There's 4800 pounds of them  Behind you  You're just fishing all day  It's just big buckets  Barrels  Of  Dogfish  And the pregnant ones  They lay live  Dogfish  They come out  Little babies  Come out live  Oh good  Did you at least throw those  Overboard  So they have a chance  I did but he just floated  He just turned around  Yeah he wiggled once  And then just said fuck it  You know the dogfish  Actually cries when you kill it 
[02:14:30]  That actually barks  Yeah  Yeah  Sounds like  Yeah you have to go out  And fetch the newspapers  But it gets them all wet  Jimmy hates fishermen  I don't mind as much  The guys that are fishing  To make food  Because I eat fish  And it's like  I can't be someone  But how much of that  Dogfish are cute  I hate the  But let me turn  Let me turn Jimmy on that  Now out of all the fish  That you guys caught  Yeah  How many  Well how many  How can we do this  How many pounds  Go to market  For people to eat  Most of it  Really  Oh most of it 
[02:15:00]  Yeah  Because you understand  Throw away a lot of shit  Every fish that comes on board  Is money  So why would you  Fucking talk  On and on and on  Shit little old fish  Jumping around  In the middle of this net  Yeah they're not happy  No that's  That's  I don't know  It's like a big FBI sting  I don't know  What the fuck that is  Water  They're jumping around  The fish  You know we were  Fuck you on everything today  Jesus Christ  Everything I say  Water  Nah it's wrong  Shut up  Am I  You said I don't know  What that is  So I said water 
[02:15:30]  Wow  Oh you were pointing at water  That's some Florida horse shit  I don't know what that is  You know  We didn't do that  We didn't bring up  But that's what the net looks like  When they come up  It's packed with fish  Yeah and then you get  But you have to take the fish  Out of the net  You know how hard it is  To take a fish out of a net  Yeah when he's stuck  By his gills  Oh god  That's what I had to do  The guy at the end  I'm guilty of this shit  I gotta tell you  As a kid  My grandma had a house  Waiting river beach house  Yeah  We're just little fuckers  And the uncles got us  A nice net  And we would spend 
[02:16:00]  All afternoon  Just going in the water  With the net  Someone would go wide  All the way around  And then we would be excited  About what we caught  And then the water  Would come in  And make these kind of pools  When high tide came in  So we put all the fish in there  Like look  They're swimming around  Surviving  Then the water would go out  And then that water  Would evaporate  And then everything we caught  All afternoon  Would fucking die  I don't think there's anything  More depressing on the earth  Than watching a fish  We didn't know any better  Die  Watching a fish die  That could be something  More depressing  Like what  Watching a human  Or a doggy die 
[02:16:30]  Generational relationships  Yeah that too  That's pretty depressing  Black president right now  These guys are just  They came into shore  Yeah  Jesus  They came into shore  With the net  Full  Full of fish  Yeah these guys do it  In two seconds  They don't soak it though  They go out  Round a circle  Throw the fish on the boat  And then bring them right back  Do any of the fish  Get thrown back alive or no  Yeah  It doesn't look like  No that's money  All that's money  Money money money  All that's money  That's money huh  My issue would be  Folding that net back up 
[02:17:00]  For the next time  What a pain  Who does that job  Well as you  Is there a system to it  On this boat  The guy at the end  Takes all the stuff up  And loads it into a bucket  And then as soon as you're done  You drop the net back out again  To let it soak for a couple days  So it comes off the back of the boat  On this metal thing  And they just kind of  Straighten it out  As it goes back out  And it kind of  Fixes itself in the water  How the fuck does it do that  I don't know  But you know what  There's federal boats  That go out in federal water  And then there's state boats  Which I was on  Alright I gotta slow you down 
[02:17:30]  You plug in your cell phone charger  By the time you unplug it  It's tangled on everything  So how the fuck  Are they  Keeping these nets  Untangled  Untangled  I don't get it  Man they got some big fish  In those nets  I don't get it either  There must be weights  Or something on the net  That make it a little easier  To kind of keep  I don't know  These plastic  They're plastic balls  Like this  They're floaties  On the top of the net  And on the bottom  I think it's a lead rope  Or weighted rope  That sinks  And the top floats  Yeah  Like a big death curtain 
[02:18:00]  For the fucking fish  Right  Yeah  That's a big fucking fish  That got caught in that net  Dude  I  That looks like a  Let me tell you  Let me see if I remember my shit  It looks like a poor fucking  How does he throw it back  Little guy  He does  There's certain fish  That means it wasn't a tuna  There's certain fish  That you catch  That you can't catch  I forget what they were  Like blue or some shit like that  That come up in the net  You have to put them back  Really  Because if the coast guard  The coast guard's out all the time  If they come over  And come on your boat  Which they all  You know 
[02:18:30]  Apparently they do a lot  If they see that fish on there  You're fucked  Alright we're gonna board ye  Yeah  So you had fun doing this Bobby  It was crazy  It just made it  It was so sad  That way  I mean  Look at the little guys  Flopping around  Hunting their skills  There are millions of them  It's like cockroaches  Look he's gotta get that one away too  I can understand  I'm against whale hunting  Because it takes a whale  Fucking ten years  To have a baby  Yes  You can't  These things fucking  Lay 900 eggs  There's a million of them around 
[02:19:00]  And if you don't kill these fucking  Like the dogfish  Oh I like this  They'll come in and kill other fish  Yeah this is the best thing  You gotta kill them  You gotta just kill them  Yes  That's what nature's system is  I'm just trying to repeat  What the captain told me  Tell the captain he's a cunt  He's a fucking great guy  You douchebag  He's not a great guy  He murders things and smokes  So don't you  The captain is a bum  To be honest with you  I don't care  To tag what Anthony said  There's a fuck about fish  You know you said  You gotta kill them  Yeah because nature  Didn't know how to  Take care of itself  Before  Yeah before  We figured out 
[02:19:30]  How to catch  Fish in gill nets  Right  I see what they're doing though  This net comes up  And then the two guys  Stand on either side  And separate  The net  As it's coming in  So they're stacking it  That's not what we do  I don't care what you do  I'm saying what these guys  Are doing  I'm telling you  I'm explaining to you  That's not what it happens  On the boat  No  No it just comes up  In a ball of shit  Like down there  Well maybe it should be  Done like this  Yeah maybe  Maybe the ball of shit  Method doesn't work  As good  But that's on a fucking lake  In Florida  These guys seem to know  What they're doing 
[02:20:00]  That's in Florida  You can see land  Yeah  That's not what I'm talking about  No I'm on the fucking ocean  Wow  You got the phones lit  First of all  Let's go to Trev in Westchester  Trev go  Hey guys  Yeah  As far as the gill nets go  Pretty much internationally  They're accepted  Under the  International sea treaty  That they're illegal  The biggest offenders  Are the Asians  Of course  Yeah I've heard that  The difference between  A gill net  And a standard net  Is the gauge  In other words  The thickness of the line  As well as the hole  In the net  Now a normal fishing net 
[02:20:30]  Allows certain size fish  To pass through  Right  And also  Sonar based mammals  Like dolphins  Whales etc  Can pick up  Thicker mesh  With their sonar  And void it  Whereas gill nets  It's impossible  So it's a very  Indiscriminate killer  So what  Gill nets are very tiny  Holes in the netting  Huh  Yeah  Very small holes  It's like a screen  Wow  It's almost like  Looking at a tennis racket  Yeah too bad  Your phone sucks  Yeah your phone is weird  I think he's in England  It's Max Headroom 
[02:21:00]  Yeah let's say hi to  Jim in LA  Hey Jim  Jim  YouTube fishing  For tuna  Jim  Sicily  Any of these  Fucking words  Mean anything to you  Anything  In Sicily  Does the name  Jim mean anything  For tuna  Yeah right here  Tuna  Line 7  Holy shit  You're on the air  I want to know  What they do  In fucking Sicily

Little genital traps  It hooks their genitals

[02:23:30]  You'd be so chill  Wouldn't you?  You'd smell like nickels  Because you fucking have blood on you  Blood everywhere  The anger you'll get out of you  Oh my god  Come back to the states  It's all just chill  I couldn't kill it  I couldn't kill anything  I can't kill fish  Patrice had the best line about fish  Why you can kill fish  Because they don't have eyebrows  Yeah yeah  It was the fucking best thing ever  Yeah  Because you don't know what they're thinking  They don't see their pain  They have the same face  Oh this guy's back

[02:30:30]  I learned the pantomime  Pantomime  There are 17 different things  A guy can do when he lies  To give himself away  A guy's got 17 pantomimes  A woman's got 20  A guy's got 17  But  If you know them  Like you know your own face  They'd be lie detectors  All to hell  Now  What we got here  Is a little game of show and tell  You don't want to show me nothing  But you tell me everything  I know you know you know where they are  So  Tell me  Before I do some damage  You won't walk away from 
[02:31:00]  Could I  Have one of those Chesterfields now  Sure  The last cigarette  So Italian  You'll ever have  It just becomes nice  Yeah you know  It's like  Yeah  That's exactly what Italian  Yeah sure buddy  Yeah here you go  Oh wait no no  You just know  He knows he's dead  And the nice music starts up  Before he tells  His  His cute little story  About Sicily 
[02:31:30]  You're Sicilian  Huh  I'll go  Nice to meet you  I didn't even say it right  Oh boy  Let's reiterate  You know  I read a lot  How good does that cigarette sound  I know  Best cigarette he ever had right there  I find that shit fascinating  Fascinating  Here's a fact  I don't know whether you know or not  Sicilians  Were spawned by niggers 
[02:32:00]  Look at Walken  Starts laughing  Come again  Come again  Come again  It's a fact  Yeah  You see  Sicilians have  Black blood  Pumped through their hearts  And no  If you don't believe me  You can look it up  Hundreds and hundreds of years ago  You see  The Moors conquered Sicily  And the Moors 
[02:32:30]  Are niggers  See you see  Way back then  Sicilians were like  Wops from northern Italy  They all had blonde hair  And blue eyes  But  Well  Then the Moors  Moved in there  And  Well  They changed the whole country  They did so much  Fucking  The Sicilian women  Huh  That they changed the whole bloodline forever  That's why 
[02:33:00]  Blonde hair and blue eyes  Became  Black hair  And dark skin  You know  It's absolutely  Amazing  Walken's looking around  He's looking around  Yeah  Smiling  That to this day  Hundreds of years later  That  That  That Sicilians  Still carry  That nigger gene  Jesus  Now this  No I'm  No I'm quoting  History  It's written 
[02:33:30]  It's a fact  It's written  I love this guy  I love this guy  The little finger point  Like  Ah  Naughty  Your ancestors are niggers  Come on  Hey  Yeah  And  And your great  Great  Great  Great  Grandmother  Fuck the nigger  Oh  Yeah  Yeah  She had a half nigger kid  Now  If that's a fact 
[02:34:00]  Tell me  Am I lying  Cause you  You're part  Eggplant  Hey  Hey  Hey  You're a cantaloupe  You're a cantaloupe  You're a cantaloupe 
[02:34:30]  You're a guy  You're a guy  Walken stands up  And he like  Puts his fist up  Like a little friendly  Like in a box  Oh  He's gonna box him  A little bit  Oh god  Is he good  I would have given this away  So fast  Making an angry face  Girl  What'd you say  I would have just ruined it  Give him a little kiss  Laughing  Yeah  I haven't killed anybody 
[02:35:00]  Since 1984  That's why  I think that's one of the best scenes  Ever shot  That I've ever seen  Between two guys  A lot of that was improv too  I know the cantaloupe line  He made it  Yeah  A lot of that was improv  And Tony Scott directed it  Which Quentin Taney  Was fucking pissed about  Really  He hates the movie  Does he really  No  Oh he did the street  Yeah he wrote it  Imagine if Tarantino  Directed this  I can't see him  Having directed it any better  I love the way  That scene looks great 
[02:35:30]  It's dark  It's fucking  The lights on Hopper's face  It's yeah  Like there's no  Getting out of there  That's definitely  A Quentin Tarantino  Fucking scene  Oh yeah  The dialogue  Yeah  The dialogue is definitely Tarantino  Even the scene with  What's his name  The pimp  Oh yeah  Gary Oldman  It's a fucking great dialogue too  Yeah  We got everything here  From One-Eyed Joe  To Damned to Fondo  Fucking great  I love movie day  Gary Oldman is the shit 
[02:36:00]  I thought we were just going to play  The one little scene  Yeah well  It was a long scene  Dude he fucking played  A white pimp  Who spoke black  He played Oswald  He played that crazy cop  Fucking Gary Oldman  Professional  The professional  Was great  He was amazing man  Now he's a fucking  Bring me everyone  Now he's a wizard  Everyone  Harry Potter  Everyone  Everyone  Everyone  He played the  Chief Gordon  Oh yeah  Commissioner  I'm sorry  Yeah  He looks like Kruskin  In the Batman movie 
[02:36:30]  Yeah  I knew you said  He does  What  What did you say  He looked like Kruskin  I heard you  I actually didn't hear it  But I had to  Wasn't it  But it wasn't even  Just a dumb observation  But he was so  Separated at birth  All men and fucking  Batman and Kruskin  He was so  Like just a nice  Normal role in that  He wasn't like anything crazy  He was just  You know  A regular guy  The walking's cadence  Is fucking  He's like in the middle 
[02:37:00]  Of a word  He'll just stop  Yeah  I like the earlier  Walking like that though  Because now  It's just become  A complete goof  When he does it  It's weird that  That happens with actors  Like Pacino  Would happen  Yeah  It becomes like  A caricature  Of themselves  Yep  But early on  Walking doing that  Is just fucking  Hysterical  When he's just going  All right  We'll take a break  Robert Kelly  Stress Factory  Late September  Just follow him  On Twitter

[02:40:30]  I've seen this video  But when you watch it  Just imagine  Four little jimmies  Oh hold on  Four Jim Nortons  Jesus Christ  Four chodes  Now  What are we looking at  One of the babies  Comes up  And rips her tit off  What is this  Wow  What is  Did she win the lottery  Oh Uncle Paul  Fucking creepy  That's a woman  And she's got a baby 
[02:41:00]  Don't touch me  Uncle Paul  Babies  Yeah she got  Four  They all look the same  Just go from  One to the other  Jesus  Come on  I guess  I'm gonna make you laugh  Now  Ready  That's creepy shit  Come and play with us  Danny  I know  That's creepy

[02:42:00]  Boo  Boo  Oh  Boo  What is the guy doing?  Showing him what Steve did all day?  No, because he'd be crying.  All right, look.  Laughing babies.  It's up there with the cutest things ever.  Thank you.  What are you going to do with it?  It's not Charlie Bittman.  The only thing that's sad about that is the four babies you can see,  which the fucking troublemaker, dumb one that's going to be arrested is.  The one that's not laughing, just sucking his thumb. 
[02:42:30]  Sucking his thumb, yeah.  So the sad part is to think of what her pussy looks like right now.  Oh, God.  It probably looks like two doors at Woolworth's just hanging.  Looks like a monkfish mouth.  Nice callback.  That was an adorable video.  It's fucking crazy.  They're all just laughing.  I wish all my crowds were like that.  Well, I'm sure the material's the same.  They were getting...  Baby's eating lemons. 
[02:43:00]  That's adorable.  Yeah.  There's other things that make that face if you show them.  Oh, God.  That video sucked.  Huh?  No, the...  I'm sorry, Paul.  The kid from the dentist and Charlie Bittman are like the two of the best ever.  Oh.  There's Jeffrey.  Oh, he's not Jeffrey, Uncle Paul. 
[02:43:30]  Blum.  My kid's cracking up.  Blum.  That's all it takes, though.  That's what you learn when you're a new parent.  Blum.  What the fuck?  All he got to do is go, blum.  Now, what does he have to do?  Two Jews walking to a bar?  He's going to laugh at the irony of it all?  This video has 134 million views. 
[02:44:00]  Holy shit.  134 million views.  Holy shit.  He should punish this baby.  What a bad baby.  The kid just finds that funny.  Why is the kid laughing?  The baby's got a great laugh, though. 
[02:44:30]  Why?  The kids are fucked up.  That's all it is.  They're like aliens.  That's all it takes.  Learn first for me to do so. 
[02:45:00]  Come on, do it.  That's fucking...  134 million fucking views for that.  Jesus, look at this.  That's good.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Don't sport a rod, Uncle Paul.  That's terrible.  Don't even fuck it.  Huh?  You used to laugh like that when you was a baby.  I didn't know you when I was a baby.  Yes, you did.  When I would kiss your tummy and go,  blum, blum, blum.  You'd laugh.  Your little Mexican laugh.  I'm not Mexican, Paul.  You adore pesos.  Pesos?  I'd say money? 
[02:45:30]  Dollars?  I'd rent you from your mutter.  Your mutter?  We have Jennifer in Detroit.  She has something on the laughing babies.  Oh.  Something he has in blackmail?  She's holding over their head.  What's up?  Those babies, that video is from like AFV like 10 years ago.  The girls, they're all girls, identical quadruplets.  They're like 10 or 11 now.  Are they how?  It's cute, but it's like a way old video. 
[02:46:00]  They were in America's Funniest Videos one year.  Yeah, you could kind of hear the audience laughing.  They have their own show or something, you're saying?  Yeah, and they even had their own show because they were identical quadruplets,  and they had their own show on Discovery Health Channel that ran like 10 episodes.  When it went bust up, people got sick of their laughing little faces.  What happened to the one?  Did they show them all four getting their period at the same time?  Yeah, boo, boo, boo.  I'm being cranky.  That'd be funny.  Where are the girls at with the two heads?  One of our favorite stories ever.  Yeah, how are they doing?  Yeah, those crazy girls, man. 
[02:46:30]  They were like getting their driver's license, and they each had their separate driver's license.  Who would fucking get in a car with that thing?  You ever see that?  Those are ugly kids.  Yeah, they didn't grow up to be cute kids.  Oh, those are the kids.  I mean, they're all right.  Oh, they're cute.  You can't tell now.  They look a little goofy.  Yeah, they're just cute, goofy girls.  Young Chelsea Clinton look.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A little too much space between the eyebrows and the hairline.  Something going on.  All right, hey, thanks.  Can we show Bobby, the two-headed girl?  Have you ever seen the two-headed girl? 
[02:47:00]  The one that plays country music, and the other one carries her around?  No.  No, this is actually just two heads on one body.  I've seen her, yeah.  She's kind of hot.  They ride a bike together?  Yeah.  She's hot.  They got two arms, two legs, and two heads.  How do you fuck that, though?  How do you fuck it?  You mush your head in between their heads.  You bury your dick in that one pussy.  They do.  They have one pussy.  And then you go, pussy.  Then you whisper in her ear, which one's feeling this right now?  They have one pussy.  So, like, what if they get married?  Wow, that's great.  Like, one gets married. 
[02:47:30]  You fucked my wife.  I fucked your wife.  You fucked my wife.  And then he gets a chance to fuck the same pussy?  Yeah.  Like, what the fuck?  Imagine coming on that huge back.  Oh, my God, right?  Jim?  Yes.  It's a murder if you kill one, but the body's still walking around.  Oh, man.  You can't chop that head off.  And who's the problem there?  Which head was supposed to be there?  Which head was just growing unexpectedly?  One of the heads is going to die and hang like a raisin on the side. 
[02:48:00]  Raisin.  Do you know what sucked, though?  Obviously, the head on the right of this picture is the problem.  That other girl was close to having a normal life.  Yeah.  It's just funny that they can buy one pair of pants, one shirt, but two hats.  Yo, it's the double hat bitches.  Motherfucking double hat bitches.  I think you're right, though.  The best one ever was the country music.  Do you think while one is sucking the dick, the guy would try to push his fucking hog onto the face of the other thing? 
[02:48:30]  Or just lay his balls on her mouth?  Yeah, like when one is sucking the balls, he's just slapping the other one's face.  And she's like, come on, you're not my boyfriend.  Stop it.  But they're actually kind of cute.  What?  I would fuck them.  You'd have to do it for the experience.  It'd be funny if they wouldn't.  They're like, no, thanks, Bob.  What if you fucked one and she was like, I love you, I love you, and the other one's just whispering,  you're a fucking faggot.  Hate you.  Look at that.  They have big tits.  They have nice tits.  Yeah.  Nice tits.  Only two tits. 
[02:49:00]  Two big tits.  Sucks that one is shaded by the other one's head half the day in the sun.  She can't get a good tan.  Constantly cheek to cheek.  Breath is in her face.  How annoying.  You always feel someone's hot breath on your cheek.  They always have to buy an extra large one piece, a wide one piece for the beach.  It's all giant.  Shop in the big and fetal alcohol syndrome section.  Jesus.  Can you sew these two together, please?  They can never wear a hood. 
[02:49:30]  That really brings up an odd thing, though, with relationships.  How do you fucking swing that?  If you're a guy, wouldn't you be jealous if another guy is fucking the same pussy but kissing  the other fucking head?  But one of them is connected to the pussy, right?  Not both of them.  No, they're both.  Oh, my God.  That's a Photoshop.  No, no, no.  Is that them?  No, that was a Photoshop.  That went around like it was the real thing, but it was proven to be a Photoshop.  How did they Photoshop?  Oh, was she in a banana or something?  How did they Photoshop?  The guy get a blowjob from the two-headed girl. 
[02:50:00]  No, because when you Photoshop, her mouth has to be open to get that to her.  Well, one of them is giving head.  She's probably one of the times when she was cursing at God, and then someone just took  a picture.  She was booing the Lord.  Oh, okay.  I get you.  I saw the original.  She was booing a church.  So this is actually...  Yeah, there's some head going on, but they added a fucking...  They added another person.  Another head.  That'd be great.  Imagine if one was a Christian and one was just a liberal.  Oh, yeah.  She's just like, I suck cock.  Their political ideology is, yeah, one's a prude, one's a whore. 
[02:50:30]  Just wake up, one's biting the other one's cheek while they're sleeping.  The prude has got to sit there while its pussy just gets pounded.  Ugh.  Fucked in the ass.  So it's one asshole, one pussy, two tits, two heads.  Yeah.  You mean sitting here?  One asshole, one pussy, two tits, and one head.  The numbers work out perfectly.  Jesus Christ.  All right, here we go.  Trevor, Minnesota. 
[02:51:00]  We're looking for an update on these girls, because we talk about them from time to time  on the show.  Trevor, go ahead.  If I could do that, Minnesota.  Good evening, gentlemen.  Hey.  Um, yeah, I think, you know, I live in a small town in Coney, Minnesota, right, just  outside where these girls, they went to high school there, but I believe they're from New  Germany.  And, uh, I've been attending a small bar, uh, Grumpy's in St. Bonnie when I'm back home  in town.  And the rumor going around is that they are, they are getting married.  To one guy?  To one guy?  Yeah.  Yeah, to one guy. 
[02:51:30]  To one guy.  So it's a threesome, kind of.  Correct.  To two and a half-some.  A guy from, from high school with, uh, from one of the local boys from California.  So I've heard.  Wow, so they would have to both be into this dude.  That's so weird, man.  That's great.  And then he's, like, kissing each face.  Oh, let me tell you, we were at Target a couple weeks ago when I was home on a couple  days, day leave from work, and, uh, they were in the Target at the customer service line  returning something.  That felt so bad.  My five-year-old daughter says, look, Daddy, two eggs. 
[02:52:00]  It's about as loud as you can ever fucking see.  Of course.  I think they're used to that by now.  Yeah.  Dude, do you have your head out the window of your truck?  Shut the fucking window.  He's in the back of a pickup.  The fuck out?  Who's he, a Mexican?  Fucking him.  Day laborer.  Day laborer listening to our show.  Motherfucker.  Your phone stinks.  Shut up.  Shut the window.  How fun would it be to just blast the load into both of their faces, though?  That would be really fun. 
[02:52:30]  Just fucking...  It would just be fucking difficult.  Like, one eats shitty, and the shit smells all the time.  The other one's like a vegetarian.  Will you stop eating pork rolls?  It goes into one's stomach.  They take turns.  You think they take turns?  It's like having a dog.  You get the morning shift.  You get the afternoon shift.  Yeah.  And do they feel like...  Because they're two separate brains.  Are both brains wired into the nerves of, like, everything?  So, do they feel like...  Do they both feel pleasure from sex? 
[02:53:00]  Do they both smell the load going into our mouth?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anthony in Minnesota.  Anthony.  Hello.  Hey.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Hi, sir.  Long-time listener.  First time caller.  We were curious.  Jim, you rule.  All right.  Jesus.  Saw you in Minneapolis.  Actually, my girlfriend worked at the Renaissance Festival.  And they came up there one time.  And she was just blown away.  She had to skip away real quick and call me. 
[02:53:30]  And she's like, there's a two-headed girl in front of me asking for a taco.  I'm like, well, are they going to share the taco?  And I was like, well, that would be kind of funny, actually.  They're sitting there trying to fight over one taco.  I could just imagine this two-headed thing coming up.  They're like, can I have a taco?  Yeah, I don't know.  It's not one.  It's two.  Well, yeah, there's two.  No, they had ordered one.  So I guess only one of them was hungry.  Hysterical.  I guess they share a stomach.  Fighting over a taco?  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh.  Oh, you suck, Robert. 
[02:54:00]  No, no, but I actually apologize.  Shut up.  I'm reading something.  No, no, dude.  I'm reading about 9-11 lawyers in a fee squeeze.  I'm sorry.  I was just looking at that while you were talking.  I just zoned out.  I was reading about these fucking lawyers that overcharged the fucking ground zero responders or  whatever, like what a fucking scumbag profession.  Was it Binder and Binder?  The guy with the funny hat?  I hate the guy with the little hat.  What is that?  That's not real.  No fucking way.  That was real. 
[02:54:30]  I'd fucking...  Oh, my God.  It was some really hot girl with two heads.  And they were perfectly cut in half, not like deformed.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like from the ear of the other one.  It's got to be a little fucked up.  Swing out like a fucking wishbone.  Definitely has to be a little fucked up.  Bobby wanted to see bikini pics, so I figured I would try and find out.  That's actually...  That's a big bikini top.  They're not that bad.  They've got pretty eyes.  For a two-headed bitch.  Really nice eyes.  Right?  You know, for a two-headed chick, yeah.  You could actually put, like, envelopes or your mail in between their necks and they  can hold it for you. 
[02:55:00]  A FedEx envelope.  Have a whole, like, picture with something.  I fucking hate him.  I just hate him.  I fucking hate Chip.  I hope Chip gets killed.  Can they turn their...  Like, can they kiss and shit?  No.  Believe me, that guy will ask.  Yeah?  Yeah, they have to be able to kiss.  Yeah.  Imagine if you beat one and the other one just pretends she doesn't notice.  Turns her head.  Yeah, they go, look at their eyes. 
[02:55:30]  Nice lips.  But why are they wearing makeup?  I don't know.  And it's much help.  What are they supposed to wear?  Ski masks?  Why don't they just wear a fucking curtain over their heads?  Charge 50 cents a showing?  Yeah.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  You lift it up and then you go, ah!  And you run away.  You throw bananas at it.  Two heads.  And then who do you talk to?  Like, you look at...  Whose eyes do you look at when you're talking?  There's no secrets.  No secrets between those two.  Yeah.  No.  Don't tell your sister. 
[02:56:00]  But I want to...  I'm right here, you...  I want to fuck you in the ass.  I heard that.  I want to fuck both you guys in the butt.  Don't tell her it's me.  It'd be great if one was just a dirtball and the other one wasn't.  Yeah.  It's my pussy, too.  Stop it.  Or one liked blacks and one was a racist.  Oh, God.  What a sitcom.  You actually have to put her out like B.A. Baracus flying every time you want to get  your pussy licked.  Knock her out. 
[02:56:30]  Inject her in the head so the other one doesn't feel it.  Or she has to stick her head out the window and just look at Bides.  Or the ones in the kitchen with her arm on the radiator or her leg up on a chair taking  fucking ebony dick.  The other one's got her head out the window just looking at Bides.  She's got her binoculars hanging off her dumb face.  Her one arm staring at Bides.  Just looking and going, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, looking at little blue jays and other  Bades.  They have all those old school hair dryers in the bed and just put it over her head. 
[02:57:00]  No, she's actually doing her audio blog about it.  And I see it.  Right now I'm looking at her.  While her sister is taking a cock up to the spleen.  Ah, these Bides.  And the one sister who likes black dick hates that her sister talks like Jimmy Durante.  Ah, these Bides are beautiful. 
[02:57:30]  Ah, cha-cha-cha, that Bides.  And the other one's like, oh, man, fuck me with that big dick.  Jimmy Durante and the wigger.  Do they have a picture of their husband?  The guy's married?  They're getting married.  We don't know if that's true.  Someone could call up with anything.  We'll just...  Yeah, we put it on a bit.  What do you...  How does that come out of a pussy, though?  How do you give birth to that?  That must have been C-section. 
[02:58:00]  C-section.  That must have been to cut her asshole off.  Just pull it out and sew her ass back on.  Just sew her asshole back on.  How does two...  You know, it's hard enough to get one fucking head out of a pussy.  One head.  Oh, this guy has info.  Mike Long Island.  Mike?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Hello.  These girls are on Discovery Channel.  They said that when they have sex and they do that stuff,  they cover the other ones with a blanket.  That's comfortable.  No way.  You're sweating under a blanket while fucking head McGillicuddy is getting a dick, 
[02:58:30]  and the guy that's fucking is trying to use a pillow to fucking kill her off.  How awful is that?  She's got her eye fucking phones on.  Her iPad or whatever.  She's got her earbuds.  Her earbuds are in.  Yeah.  You're trying to fuck, and then you hear like...  Our lips are sealed.  Like her awful music.  Can't keep your dick hard.  You're listening to the Go-Go's while fucking what is a genetic disaster.  You're actually fucking a cell that went wrong. 
[02:59:00]  A malformed cell.  Did the girl's phone ring?  She's like, I can't talk right now.  My sister's taking it in the asshole.  My sister's taking an unclipped dick in our asshole.  She'd probably say it like real passive-aggressive.  My sister's getting fucked in our asshole.  Sometimes she thinks she owns it.  You think they have to fight it over who's turning us to wipe?  Hey, look, I'm getting salt and vinegar potato chip crack.  You were supposed to wipe better. 
[02:59:30]  We have any audio on these girls?  Oh, shit.  Nothing about sex, but...  Oh, there you go.  We're into photography.  We have a job.  Of course you're into photography.  Everybody yanks out their camera when you walk by.  Holy shit, stop that thing.  This isn't a normal life.  Did you see the ones swimming?  Separated, because then we won't get to do all the things that we can do.  Yeah, you'd be half a body. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, good.  Yeah, they're playing softball.  They probably want one for 80 in the season.  Oh, great.  Two ounces up.  This is Abby's driver's license.  And this is Brittany's driver's license.  Why?  That's cool.  And this is our $10,000 a month insurance policy.  Because we have two heads.  There's the driving instructor sitting on a fucking toilet seat he brought in when he shits himself.  They're getting in a car.  That is crazy.  I look out the passenger window, and I look out the driver window. 
[03:00:30]  We're both doing our makeup on top of it.  Look.  Do I want to make it any more dangerous than it is?  Slime colors.  I passed.  You passed?  Yeah.  And I ran over the slime.  What did you pass?  I still passed.  The fucking audition at Ringling Brothers?  And the shifter.  And I take over the...  And we both steer.  We both steer.  And I take over the blinker.  It's called directional fucking dude's head.  Look at her ass.  Holy freak show. 
[03:01:00]  Do you see her ass?  They can clap.  Does she have a good ass?  It's fucking a truss.  It's a back.  Oh, is it?  It's a spinal cord.  Like a tail sticking out.  They told us that they each have...  Is that the disaster of the mother?  That they each have a set of lungs.  Wow, man.  That they each have a stomach.  That's great.  But only one cunt.  From the stomach comes a small intestine, and they each have that, which joins in...  But that's where it ends.  ...to the large intestine.  One ass.  Look at that ass.  And they have just one bladder and the female organs.  One bladder.  Say pussy.  Oh, my God.  One...  So split the pussy. 
[03:01:30]  Who cares?  The danger is far greater than the possible gains.  When I think of what separating would have been...  They couldn't divide up the...  You know, it's much.  Ah, slice it down the middle.  How many tickets do they have to buy on a plane?  Oh, my God.  I'd hate to get stuck next to them.  ...somehow put back on them artificially.  So I'm really happy in what we've decided for our girls.  Hi, would you two things like a peanut?  Oh, God.  Yeah, great.  Look in the ears.  The doctor's going to act like it's normal.  How will married life work? 
[03:02:00]  Will they be able to have children?  Are we going to be moms?  We haven't thought about how it's being moms going to work.  The girls have two very different personalities.  Yeah.  Don't touch it.  Believe me, we are totally different people.  Abby is more into pink and girly and puppy, and Brittany's more not into pink.  I like hats.  I hate how their hats express their individuality.  Yeah, that's all they can do to express it.  They're hats and gold purses and weird earrings and stuff like that. 
[03:02:30]  Hello?  Oh, God.  Hi, Nancy.  Oh, my God.  They're on the phone.  Like, they put the phone in between them.  Of course they do.  And they're both babbling together.  They're on face Facebook.  That was the end of the clip.  Ah, shit.  I was totally getting into that.  That was good.  Abby and Brittany, the two-headed fucking monster. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, that ass was horrible.  That was a terrible ass.  One girl had a booty, and the other one didn't.  Yeah.  That's great.  One cheek.  Yeah.  She got one cheek, and the other one just got back.  Looked like an apple and a lima bean put together.  She's got a hamstring that goes to the back of her neck.  Apparently, they are actually on Facebook.  Yeah.  Are they?  I was just looking at their Facebook page.  Friends, zero.  Gawkers, 5,000.  They have two different Facebooks. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, come on.  Of course they do.  Stop it.  Let me see.  Is it private?  Why would it be private?  Why do you think?  Exactly, because I'd love to send cock pictures to one.  Don't tell your sister.  This is for you to look at, not the other one.  Then I'd send her another one.  I'd send the other one.  Don't tell that fucking cunt sister.  I'd turn them against each other. 
[03:04:00]  You know, Abby said you're a real cunt.  What?  She was writing that.  We missed out on something really good.  Jonathan, Wisconsin.  Go ahead.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Hey.  Hey, two stomachs and one asshole.  How much does this thing shit?  Yeah.  This thing has to be shitting a lot.  Because they both have to eat.  Because they both got to fill up.  That's right.  Yeah.  And then it goes into a fucking traffic jam.  It's like when old Lane's closed down.  It's like two garbage chutes leading to the same teeny little fucking kitchen can. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, that's got to be fucking some loads of shit.  How annoying is it when one's stomach is rumbling and she's like, oh, fuck, I don't want to shit again.  It's like, you have to have a sore asshole.  Because what's her name?  Won't stop eating tacos.  And Mexican and onions.  I want salsa dip.  Our asshole is going to hurt for a week.  Like, you're wiping this time, you.  Like, the one eats really healthy vegetables and she hates the other one eating chili because  then she hears, we better go to the bathroom. 
[03:05:00]  I love cameras.  Of course you do.  Of course you do.  Now, do they both feel, when they're getting fucked, do they both feel orgasm?  I assume they have that one vagina, so I would think.  They both feel the orgasm, so it's two bitches screaming at the same time.  See, these are the questions that need to be addressed.  One's a size queen and one likes Asians.  Ow!  Oh, I'm coming!  Ow!  How horrible that must be. 
[03:05:30]  One likes a finger in the ass, the other doesn't care for it.  Care for it.  How would you share an asshole?  That should be a term when people get divorced and they have to give the kid back and forth.  You fucking, you know.  Oh, damn, man.  How would you share an asshole?  That is fucked up.  I don't, uh...  That was the last, uh, any more clips?  Let's get some more clips of these fucking good...  There's gotta be more.  This whole fucking YouTube should be all clips of them doing anything.  I want to hear more of them.  This is a clip that should have 134 million views, right?  I want to hear more of these fucking dummies. 
[03:06:00]  I hate how they play softball.  You know they're lousy.  Oh, totally.  Come on.  Now batting, numbers 41 and 43.  Wait, was that a song about them?  I think it was just...  Oh, please tell me...  Two heads are better than one.  I'm pretty sure it was just, uh...  Two heads are better than one, but not as good as a coat hanger.  If you get my drift.  This whole thing could have been fixed.  Well, how many halves did they get on Christmas?  Nothing but round boxes under the Christmas tree. 
[03:06:30]  Guess what?  We got it.  We know.  They got a burlap sack with holes in it.  Why doesn't one suffocate the other one in the middle of the night?  Oh, here we go.  Ten.  We can drive.  Now they're driving.  Nine.  We go to high school.  Okay.  Eight.  We're into photography.  Yes.  Seven.  We like a lot of different kinds of music.  Six through one.  We have two heads.  We like to go shopping a lot.  Five.  We have a job.  Four. 
[03:07:00]  We like to go on the internet.  Of course we do.  Of course.  You should watch beheadings.  Two.  We're in a school.  One.  We talk a lot more.  Perhaps most noteworthy about it.  That is Al Qaeda's dream right there.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you kill one to make an example out of her, and the other one has to fucking read  the statement.  You lost in us to live in a normal life.  That is not to say we haven't been challenged.  Jesus Christ.  The school presented a number of questions.  Do they turn in one assignment or two?  How do they take tests?  The one's cheating.  Of course he is. 
[03:07:30]  The one lazy whore is just watching the other one do the work.  She's just resting her head on the other one's head.  Did you copy its work?  Abby wants me to explain everything.  Oh, good.  She's dyke-haired fucking gym teacher helping them out.  Close 32.  32.  I have 7B plus 4C, 7B minus 4.  You just asked your sister.  Tell me.  She's right there next to you.  See, I'm wrong.  They shouldn't be in school.  I would have just let them in a cage and made them eat food and shit. 
[03:08:00]  They're in a Catholic school?  Why would you believe in God?  Of course they are.  I know you want to.  Please.  What the fuck?  But they found out that they couldn't see your head.  That would be a game changer for me, man.  The person in front would cause an obstacle for Brittany.  So they went through about three or four days.  Hey!  And argued about where to sit before they saw them.  Why would you sit in the front row?  Oh, my God.  Could you move your heads, I guess, on the blackboard?  Exactly.  The giant fucking Harry Z assholes at a movie theater. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, yeah.  That would suck.  They sit in front of you.  Oh, here they are eating.  If you have issues and don't argue about where to sit, it's at the lunch table.  How does anyone else eat looking at them?  You show them sitting and everybody else vomiting in their place.  They serve a potato and there's a little spud growing off it.  They all elbow each other.  How long before they have a shit after they eat lunch?  You get something in your tooth.  Not you.  The other one.  Oh, there's the parents playing the old blame game again.  He's got bad sperm. 
[03:09:00]  Old dumpster womb.  After lunch, it's time for Brittany's favorite class, American Lit.  Luckily, the teacher, Mr. Boziki, is both of their favorites.  Oh, good.  The other one hates the class, so she puts a sheet over her face.  What's the freak saying?  One more time.  I understand you're a little rowdy. 
[03:09:30]  Don't be your only goofy sophomores.  You have plenty of time to be obnoxious, right, seniors?  Yeah, make believe you don't see the big fucking elephant in the room.  It is the greatest excuse.  Why are you late?  We have two heads.  All right.  Do you have a pass?  The other head ate it.  I can't get a head.  Carry on.  And walking has to be fucked up because of your perspective of two different eyes.  Yeah, what if one's just dumb and, like, looking at birds?  Yeah.  Walking to a point.  Boyd.  She likes Boyd watching. 
[03:10:00]  While the other one's got fucking black dick wrecking her.  The other one's just a blabber mouth.  Uh-oh.  They like him.  Shut up.  You have two heads.  Exactly.  No matter what they say, they try to be smart.  Exactly.  Each one of you gets a tit.  Now, shut your mouth.  Certainly more contemplative.  More contemplative?  Why?  Because there's two brains working on something?  What's that mean?  Poor girl can't wear a necklace.  What's a necklace?  It's a necklace. 
[03:10:30]  A necklace.  On a picnic basket.  And they do a bicycle chain.  The only thing big enough.  Ranger Smith, here's a necklace.  Yes.  It's like a necklace, but you wear it around your neck.  It's a guy named Nick hanging off your neck.  It's a necklace.  A necklace.  Oh.  That's some good shit.  That is some great fucking...  They are just weird.  Freaks.  I fucking...  I'd fuck either one of them.  I'm so confused.  You mean either one?  You'd fuck both of them.  Too many questions.  You don't have a choice.  Too many questions.  Is there another clip? 
[03:11:00]  Please, it has to be.  The whole fucking internet should be these two.  I know.  I can't get enough.  I need to know more about these freaks.  Why do these clips only have 37,000 views?  Because people can't get through it.  It's like watching two girls, one torso.  Two girls, one cunt.  Oh, here they go.  What's that?  Ouch.  Inflection.  Sorry.  What are they doing?  How do they sleep?  No, I hit that light.  What are they doing?  Pick it up higher, mama.  No, no. 
[03:11:30]  Don't do that.  Oh, shut up.  I can't get it any higher.  Then you try doing this.  Oh, they made a beanbag chair.  That's cool.  For them to sit in.  Are these hairs okay, right?  Nice tits.  I don't care.  I'm not going to.  I already said my piece.  Don't you be mad.  It was your fucked up womb that got us like this.  Exactly.  You bitch.  Don't be mad at us fucking too many shots.  Really?  Oh, tequila pregnancy.  Hey, bourbon pussy, don't yell at us.  Hey, two packs a day snack. 
[03:12:00]  I'm Benson, she's Hedges.  Five years ago, Abby and Brittany Hensel made a rare appearance in a documentary called  Join for Life.  Oh, my God.  It looks like the one is attacking the other one.  Shut up.  We got through Hensel.  As they've grown, much of their life is still the same.  Yeah.  They still live in the same small town in Minnesota with their 14-year-old brother,  Cody. 
[03:12:30]  Who refused to be seen in this documentary.  Parents, Mike and Patty, and the family dog.  Who barks at them whenever they walk in the room.  After 20 years, the dog still barks at them and snaps.  There's a two-headed monster in the house.  It's the only one that understands there's a fucking monster in the house.  No one else will acknowledge it.  They're like, why are you barking?  The dog's like, I just woke.  I spoke English once.  Bark, bark.  There's a monster in the house. 
[03:13:00]  You stop embracing it like it's us.  Here's mourning.  Here's mourning.  Here's mourning.  Abby and Brittany out of bed.  Out of bed.  Jesus.  Not an easy task.  Yeah.  They can't roll over.  Exactly.  To put it simply, Abby and Brittany are not mourning people.  No.  No.  Lazy horse.  Unfortunately, the parents weren't mourning after they were born.  That's right.  Speaking of mourning, how about that mourning after pill?  That might have helped.  That's how good-looking the other two kids are, too. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  They have to help each other's hair.  Oh, exactly.  Totally in sync.  But that doesn't mean they always agree.  They have to read two newspapers on the toilet.  The New York Times and the Post are different girls.  Believe me, we are totally different people.  Nice gums.  Abby is more into pink and girly and pink.  Yeah, we already saw this bullshit clip.  I like hats.  I like different colors.  We like you with hats, too.  I like hats.  You like ski masks.  It'd be funny.  One was a Yankee fan.  One was a Red Sox fan.  Oh, God.  They just beat each other all day long. 
[03:14:00]  How do they sleep?  Do they sleep sitting up, though?  I can lay down.  They didn't show that.  I guess that was too private.  They're too hot.  Yeah.  We usually bargain with each other.  I'll bet you the mother just throws them in a closet with the dog toys.  We take turns.  We take turns.  They have to sleep on top of a little rubber ball and the dog spit on them.  And the next day, Adam will pick the outfit.  Oh, they ticked.  All right, so not much more to do.  Just brush your teeth.  Oh, the morning breath.  All 67 of them.  As far as they've gotten to be more independent. 
[03:14:30]  That's right.  Brush your teeth with this, the shotgun.  What the hell is she doing?  Every part of their life is cooperating with each other.  I think people need to...  I bet that fold in between the V of their neck gets real filthy.  It's got to take a cute tits to it.  Smells like the back of Voss's ear.  You could fuck it, though, I bet.  You could fuck your neck folds.  Yeah.  Just lube up her neck folds.  Would it be considered two rapes?  And just mush her heads together like fucking coconuts? 
[03:15:00]  It's just fucking pound away.  They would always hate when a stranger puts Vaseline on their ears and fucks their heads.  I want to tit fuck your necks.  Exactly.  Why are they wearing shorts?  I don't know.  They're horrible asses.  In fact, Abby and Brittany are, in nearly every sense, perfectly normal teenagers.  Except for what?  Except for the two heads going out of their shoulders. 
[03:15:30]  Except for their fucking 60-inch waist.  And the horrible ass.  ...definition of individuality or how their futures might be affected by their unique situation.  Did they get jealous of the planets in the background there?  Because they're separated?  Having lived in their small town since they were born, fortunately, they've become familiar  What cousin were they fucking?  They've become familiar.  They were familiar 30 seconds after they were born.  Everybody in that fucking grain shitty town knew what they were. 
[03:16:00]  They were known as the Bobsy things.  Oh, frickin' frack over there.  And Abby and Brittany don't know the world.  First 10 years they tried to burn them.  Yeah.  Like a stupid town.  Would always visit the house with pitchforks and torches.  They'd throw them on a scale with a chicken to see if they were witches.  After a few appearances when they were much younger, they and their family decided that  was not the life they needed.  That's right.  One pussy, two heads!  One pussy, two heads!  That's what the town people would chant. 
[03:16:30]  And most of all, to new individuals whose greatest accomplishment is how normal their lives  continue to be.  Of course it's normal.  And the world has all these questions for them.  Yeah.  Of course it does.  Number one, you might be invading their space.  It's not number one.  So, what do they do with their pussy is number one.  And second of all, it's things that they really can't explain.  I have one question.  How did you get a nuclear reactor rod in your consciousness while conceiving them?  Yeah, a fucking plutonium clip.  Three mile uterus.  Do you remember being abducted by a fucking spaceship and having your egg fucking booted 
[03:17:00]  around for a little while by a scientist with fucking radio antennas on his head?  Five, we have jobs.  Four, three, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four, three, four,  She went for broken ribbon x-rays 80 times during pregnancy.  Did you see them talking on the phone?  No, she was repped in the phone.  I hit the chick's head.  Oh, they're getting a pedicure.  Oh, that's good. 
[03:17:30]  Being conjoined has presented astonishingly few obstacles to leading a normal life.  Really?  That is not to say there haven't been challenges.  Yeah.  School presented a number of questions.  Like?  Do they turn in one assignment or two?  Oh, we saw this already.  But this is, they have to, they have to, when they masturbate, they had to fucking, they  had to do that together, like talk about it and be like, look, I'm going to play with  my pussy right now.  Are you cool with this?  Are you ready?  Because I want to come.  That's the quick answer.  I don't.  But I need my pussy.  I'll be the one who will rub her pussy and then put her fingers on the other one's nose. 
[03:18:00]  But it stinks when she rubs it.  When the one rubs her own, it's okay.  That teaches the girls math and English.  And his witness dad being really good.  We already saw this one with the fucking, with Brian Dennehy, the lady teacher.  Oh, here they are, they're bigger now, playing softball, batting 0-62. 
[03:18:30]  She's going to swing her sister's head around her zilches.  All I would do is bean that moment.  Oh, wait a minute.  Could you rewind?  Because they were talking about sensations on the body.  Oh, okay.  All right.  All right.  We could translate that to sex and shit.  Yes.  Yet, every moment is an act of teamwork.  Abby controls the right arm and right leg.  Brittany, the left.  That's fucked up.  Each has no sensation of the other side of the body.  Oh.  But somehow, intuitively, they work in concert.  What?  In concert?  Wow.  One giant flute?  They are, in a sense, remarkable because they seem so average. 
[03:19:00]  That is amazing.  Looking back over the 16 years since their birth, it's clear that from the very start, they were extraordinary.  Yeah.  At the time of their birth, Mike and Patty didn't even know they were having twins.  They fought violently over whose fault it was.  I was expecting one chance.  Accusations of infidelity.  They were telling me that when they were trying to pull them out, they felt an accident.  And having sex with a chupacabra.  And then, when I got out, they realized that they were convinced.  Yes. 
[03:19:30]  You know he was fucked.  Yes.  Apparently, they...  And the gypsy whose daughter they ran over.  You know, they had to...  I died with it in my two mouths.  They had to return all the shower gifts.  Oh, my God.  One person, as a joke, brought, like, a fucking two-headed thing, and they kept it.  Like a giant bra, and they just made hats out of it. 
[03:20:00]  They were both crying.  Abby was crying tremendously, probably because she wanted to eat.  The first time I seen him, it just didn't take about a second to...  Who's this guy?  He looks like Bill Clinton to be a Down syndrome.  That's the father.  This guy explained the first time he saw his daughter.  I ran through the fucking wall like fucking Herman Munster.  I ran out of the maternity ward screaming.  Who put these things at our best in us?  There's no medical tests to ensure that there were no life-threatening issues. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah!  Jesus, fucking Rosemary was happier to see what flew out of her box.  They told us that they each have a heart.  Ruth Gordon should be protecting this thing.  There's a devil's blood.  Satan is his father.  Holy shit!  Oh, my God.  The fucking...  They said one vagina.  Their type of conjoinment, more medically as pyropagous, survival was rare. 
[03:21:00]  Pyropagous.  What is that?  It sounds disgusting.  It sure does.  It's like something you get under your shoe.  Fucking steps in pyropagous.  Come on, they can't play piano.  Of course they can't.  As they grew and learned to ride...  One's a black belt.  One's a pussy.  One's a shit talker.  She always tries to get the right arm punched.  Oh, great.  Volleyball.  Volleyball.  Oh, yeah.  A dentist has to be double the fucking charge.  There has been a flurry of new questions surrounding one of their latest milestones.  Oh, that's right.  There's slow jobs. 
[03:21:30]  One gets vertigo, and the other one loves conjoinment.  One gets two people, but master a task that would seem to require...  Who's this brave driving instructor?  He's wearing, like, Michelin Man outfit clothing.  Bunch of tires around him.  Hard the other way now.  All right.  Oh, there you go.  Hard as you can.  Look over your shoulder.  Yeah, I see an ear.  I'm being followed by a fleshy seashell.  And that's just her ear. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, look at that one.  Hey, gums McGillicuddy.  Fucking Jesus.  You're picking on her gums.  She brushed with a fucking paint roller.  Couldn't God have at least given her a nice smile.  Two Sharon Cope motherfuckers.  Two purse-having bitches.  Why not?  Yo, double pocketbooks in the house.  Look at the father, smiling. 
[03:22:30]  Turn the cameras off, please.  All right, I'm back.  That kind of made me nervous.  I have the concerns about her driving.  Fucking Jimmy.  Fuck, man.  As any parent does when their child is in the car without that.  Concerns about the driving.  Yeah, they cut the brake lines.  Yes.  Yes, send them down the hill.  Yes.  That the radio caused the accident or the fallen CD or the fallen cell phone.  No, I think the accident was caused by the two heads on one body, madam. 
[03:23:00]  Let's see if the car's coming, although there's been times where four eyes still didn't see it.  Four eyes.  How you doing?  You guys ready?  Yeah.  Pat Foley is charged with getting the girls ready for the state driver's license.  Pat Foley is a fucking asshole.  Pat Foley is a...  Yeah, working with the girls.  Evil Knievel is in charge.  Pat Foley fingered their vagina while they were driving to Tattletales.  Their mom and dad have done a lot of work with them.  They have to maneuver together. 
[03:23:30]  And one of the things that I noticed the first one, when we first went out, was they were cutting their lap turns a little bit.  They had two heads.  Yes.  The first thing I noticed was two heads.  Yeah, one was looking in the mirror, one was looking at bites.  From behind the wheel, we had to have six hours of driving with an instructor.  We learned how to parallel park.  Yes.  We ruined three cars and killed 11 people.  Why?  There's a monster driving down the street. 
[03:24:00]  The dog barks every time they walk in there.  It's been barking since they came home.  They try to pet it and just nip track her.  They try to bring the dog whisperer over.  He goes, I think he has barking because there's a two-headed monster in Dallas.  What if one bit somebody? 
[03:24:30]  Would they both go to jail?  I think Brittany actually murdered me.  Between the two of them.  On one hand was holding the gun.  Pedals and the shifter.  And I take over the...  And we both steer.  We both steer.  And we herk and jerk at one mile an hour.  It's great if we're going from the driveway to the kitchen.  But if we have to go anywhere else, we just get a ride.  They have one necklace on.  Of course they do.  Do you have a rope chain that's 87 inches long? 
[03:25:00]  Exactly.  Something you can hang somebody with in Iran.  We like a heart on the end of it.  Or actually two.  Or one asshole.  Do you have a chain with one asshole on it?  It looked like the shoulder monster that chased around Buck's body.  When it came to get their licensure, the big question I think in everybody's mind is...  Jesus, this woman has the fucking worst hairdo.  Holy shit.  Hey, Robert Plant.  There's some ugly people in this learning channel. 
[03:25:30]  The girl's position since birth, Dr. Joy Westerdahl knows her skin's capabilities...  She's been their doctor since birth.  Has she really?  Oh, boy.  Should she be investigated?  I think she's stressed out.  Look at that back.  They really do have a fucking huge fucking Jim Jeffcoat back.  Oh, let's go to the doctor.  We're obviously making sure that they're fit for sports, they're fit for their activities  at school, that they're able to...  How about a headstand?  Can they do it?  Those are not unique to the girls. 
[03:26:00]  However, because they have two hearts, lungs, circulatory systems that are conjoined, I'm  looking to make sure they're not developing premature high blood pressure, respiratory problems.  Hey, how are you?  I'm measuring how tall they are.  Okay.  That was good.  Haven't seen you in a while.  You have two heads.  I'm not talking to you.  I'm talking to your sister.  I watched you drive in.  How was your drive?  Good.  Was it?  Was it?  Yeah, it's cool. 
[03:26:30]  I watched you smash it.  Eight cars in the car.  Yes.  I watched you scrape the paint off of fucking the surgeon's car.  And yet, they can clap, even though one controls one arm and the other controls the other.  Yeah, big fucking whoop.  They can clap.  It's not going to seal.  You know what they can't do?  Sleep with one head.  And vice versa.  So if you put her in nasal court...  Oh, is that a fucking...  Oh, I thought it was good until you had a size function.  Is that one of those gynecologist fucking things? 
[03:27:00]  Oh, no.  A speculum?  I thought they were going to speculum the shit out of them.  It's an ear.  It's an ear thing.  She's checking their ears.  You can see through both of their heads.  Could they become mothers?  Of course.  Come on.  Doctor.  Tell us.  All right.  How about you tell us, doc?  Thank you.  What about the fucking...  So this isn't the ear that's bugging you?  Um, both were, but...  Yeah, the ear's bugging her because the sister's yelling into it all the time.  Because they suck.  She has gum in her ear. 
[03:27:30]  She always spits her gum in her sister's ear.  I thought it was wax, but she's just spitting up above it in my ear.  The physiology of the body is very complex, especially when it comes to female reproduction.  Oh, here we go.  It's not simply organs, but it's regulated by several centers in the brain.  We have two brains that we're working with that have to regulate the ability to have a child.  I suspect everything will go normally, but that only time will come.  How about coming, Baldy?  Yes.  They should give us no answers that we want.  I don't know.  You know we wanted to know.  Exactly.  What if they have a baby and it's just normal and it's got to look at them? 
[03:28:00]  Oh, it's got to take that to the parent-teacher conference.  Here's my freakazoid mom.  Here's my mom, my mom, and my dad.  Here's my mothers and my low self-esteem father.  That fucking lady doctor was annoying me.  If you don't know, she looked like Gene Wilder.  She was truly terrible.  With her worst hair.  Yeah.  She should have been screaming like him when they walked in.  I'm really just, I can't believe I'm saying this about fucking those nice girls.  Oh, fuck them, two-headed freak. 
[03:28:30]  You're saying that now?  It's been an hour and a half.  I really am.  Fucking the worst shit I've ever heard about anybody.  My favorite is the angry dog.  I love that the dog, after all these years, still just horrified by the rest of his family.  He barks and growls every time.  The totally honest thing in that house is that dog.  He nips at their legs because he senses that one leg has no idea what the other one's doing.  The other one's got his propped up on a kitchen and the other one's looking at bides. 
[03:29:00]  Bides.  Holy fuckaroni.  Goddamn.  Bravo, my friend.  Bravo.  Wow.  You want to take a little break?  Yeah, I got to fucking lay down.  I got a tinkle.  Maybe I'll laugh.  All right, we'll break and finish up next.  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  It's a virus.  Yeah.  It's the Obedient 3 Show.  Yeah.  Ow.  Oh.  Is she not a ride?  Is she insane?  Well, she now.  Run, run, like the love of the anxious day. 
[03:29:30]  Ah, she not a ride.  Ah, she insane.  Well, she now.  Run, run, like the love of the anxious day.  Nice.  Robert Kelly in studio today.  Playing the Stress Factory.  Hi.  End of September.  September 30th to October 2nd.  What's the Twitter, brother?  I always forget.  You changed it, right?  I actually got Robert Kelly.  You got Robert Kelly finally.  Cool.  Stressfactory.com for tickets.  Right on.  A couple things before we get out of here.  There's a fucking nine-day, 60-mile traffic jam going on in China. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you just get rid of your car?  Nine days.  Well, they're doing construction, yeah.  No, no, no.  It's not like a guy's been sitting there for nine days.  But for nine days, there's been a 60-mile.  They're getting through it, but it doesn't take you nine days to get through it.  Do you know what I'm saying?  It's like the nine-day, it's 60.  How long is the average person sitting in the traffic jam?  I don't know.  I mean, it could be 10 hours.  I just don't know.  Come on.  Then it wouldn't be a big deal.  That's the Long Island Expressway, basically, you explained. 
[03:30:30]  60 miles.  What do we know on the traffic jam?  For 60 miles, it just, well, I see, but the...  60-mile traffic jam going on in China for the past nine days.  All right.  A traffic jam stretching more than 60 miles in China has entered its ninth day with no end in sight.  Cars and trucks have been slowed to a crawl since August 14th.  Construction.  Oh.  Which is also known as the blah, blah, blah.  Officially expect the congestion to continue until workers complete construction projects.  Oh, the highway?  It's called the...  Highway. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, that's right.  I didn't do my bit.  Fuck.  I could have done my bit today.  Gregorio.  State media reported that Chinese drivers have become accustomed to the severe delays.  Noting a similar jam in July.  Oh, God, right.  Minor traffic jams.  I want to know what the average person is doing in this fucking traffic jam.  They've taken to card games of chess to pass the time.  Probably.  I guess it stops.  I don't get it. 
[03:31:30]  A 60-mile.  Would you find another way to work if you know this is happening?  Fucking.  I went to Chinatown.  They don't use tissues.  They snot rocket?  They snot rocket.  Oh, God.  Old ladies, young...  Disgusting.  And they're like Clint Eastwood with them.  They could hit a cat moving across the street.  It's like a bunch of snot boogers.  Bullets, I mean, flying, you know, Bob?  Fucking Anthony.  All right.  Hey, what?  I hate Chip. 
[03:32:00]  What's that?  You don't hate nobody.  Why don't you go hate yourself or something?  I hate a bunch of hats.  It's making a dickhead?  Oh.  What?  Ballerina, what do you want?  What are you doing?  Put ballerina in.  Hey, I don't get it.  What?  The Chinese thing.  I guess construction, so it's just squeezing through.  Bunch of cars.  They weren't allowed to have cars.  It's a bottleneck.  It's a bottleneck.  What is the average person doing?  Are they leaving for work at one in the morning and getting there at nine? 
[03:32:30]  Who knows what their culture is like over there?  That's true.  They just fucking sit there.  They got the hangy hats on.  They had bikes and mopeds.  They had pointy hats and throwing hand grenades in helicopters.  You see what was on Drudge yesterday?  The teenager?  What?  Crashing the car?  Have you seen this yet?  I have not.  Oh, the video?  From the 100 miles an hour caught on the fucking police cam?  I haven't seen it.  Have you seen this yet?  No.  I don't know.  It's in a lot of places.  That is a good one.  You got Danny.  I guess he's dead.  No, he lives.  I hear he's doing okay so far. 
[03:33:00]  He lived through it.  What, did he shoot out the sunroof?  Well, I'm going to show you here.  Here we go.  So, this video is everywhere.  I'm sure you can find it.  If you're internet savvy.  Whap.  Let me see.  I can't see.  I can't see.  Danny.  So, you got a dashboard cam.  You get the news you need, no matter where you are.  Really?  Does he crash into the computer?  Hey, Captain. 
[03:33:30]  Dashboard cam.  All right.  Cops just going along, and all of a sudden, to the left, you'll see this fucking teenager  fly by.  They say he was doing about 100 miles an hour.  Then he hit kind of a guardrail, sort of like a ramp, and then hit that overpass.  I am.  Giving it away, just so you can watch this.  Oh.  Yep.  Bam!  Wow.  He got airborne.  Wow.  That was a good one.  Got fucking airborne.  Oh, man.  Almost hopped right over the overpass.  He hit that guardrail up in the air. 
[03:34:00]  And then hit the pylon, right?  I think that saved him.  It did absolutely save him because...  Because it diverted him from hitting that fucking pylon.  That was actually Burt Reynolds.  Yeah.  And Hooper.  And Hooper.  Remember Hooper?  He did hit the pylon.  You can see a big chunk taken out of it.  That's a bad fucking accident.  And he lived through that fucking shit?  That's what I'm hearing.  I don't know.  You've got to be the cop going, oh, we are so pulling pieces out of this fucking thing.  That's actually the two-headed girl driving a school.  She was doing 10 miles an hour.  Because the one was looking at what, Jimmy? 
[03:34:30]  Bodies.  The one was putting on lipstick and the other one was looking at bodies.  Is that him flying out of the car going into the green lane?  No way.  I don't know.  Is that or is that a big...  No fucking way.  Wait.  Watch a big chunk go flying to the right.  Right there.  Bounce.  Bounce.  Is that him sliding across?  Yeah.  You think?  It's him with the engine.  Jeez.  I don't know either.  I don't know.  It does look like a body the way it hit the thing and kind of flipped over.  Fudukara, fudukara, fudukara.  Yeah, that's the sound of it.  Fudukara. 
[03:35:00]  What else is on the camera?  Is that it?  Hopefully the cop beating him with a stick.  Taser-ing him.  Taser-ing him.  Giving that motherfucker a taser.  Laying in the street bleeding and you tase him.  Me friends in the middle of the road bleeding to death.  Benjamin was ejected.  He was.  So that's him flying across the highway.  Wow.  What the fuck?  Gosh, dang it.  Car broken into three.  Why would you fly by a cop?  Well, he's on the median.  Maybe he was losing control.  Being chased or something. 
[03:35:30]  Oh.  What do you mean?  Behaving in a...  I don't know.  I don't know the details.  I think that is him flying out.  Wow.  Wow, is he lucky?  He almost got run over by that other car.  Yeah, the other car.  He's lucky.  Probably by chance, his insurance is going to go up to like $2 million a month.  Okay, that went sideways.  Yeah, that's him.  That's him.  Oh, that's got to hurt.  Did he faceplant too?  That's going to leave a mark.  Oh.  There is nothing left of that car.  Get the news, Judy.  No, my other fuck. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  All right, this guy knows about the Chinese traffic jam.  Oh, yeah?  Brian and...  Ding-dai!  You're on the line?  Brian in London.  How's it going, guys?  Some guy's been in that traffic jam for like three days, and he's complaining about the  price of noodles from the roadside vendors.  He says they're charging him too much for his cup of noodles.  Charging me too much for noodles.  Why would you be stuck in a jam for three days?  I'm stuck in a traffic charger.  I think your boss will understand.  Too much for noodles. 
[03:36:30]  I don't want to spend so much money on noodles.  Where are you going that you can't just get a hotel or take an alternate route?  He says it's quicker than getting off and going some other place.  It probably is.  What's the other way?  Dirt road to fucking hell.  You build a boat?  The Great Wall.  It's the top of the Great Wall.  You've got to drive on it.  I'd say keep them all in the jam.  Why would you say that?  Nobody would laugh or find it interesting if you did.  I'd say.  I'd say. 
[03:37:00]  I'd say.  You know what they should do.  You know what they should do thing again.  Right, right, right.  Roadside vendors have a quadruple price on noodles.  Interviewed drivers say they're not leaving because alternate route would use up more gasoline.  Well, I don't know if it's what the deal is with whatever.  I'm not sure.  Yeah, roadside vendors have been fucking hard.  All right, let me go to Jeff in Columbus.  Jeff.  Hey, you boys.  Love the show. 
[03:37:30]  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Right, with the fucking.  Dude, how many times do we have to hear that?  For real.  Okay.  Go ahead.  What?  I was wondering if the guy had enough wits about him to hit the General E-horn before  he hit the concrete support shot.  This is why we hate the fucking callers, man.  It's like one fucking bad joke after another.  Hey, Bob Kelly.  Why don't you get some cancer and die?  Dude, it's me you're talking to.  And don't try to incorporate the fucking lingo of the show.  It's annoying. 
[03:38:00]  Hey, did you wake up on the wrong side of the back of that?  No, I didn't.  I'm just sick and tired of guys like you wrecking the fucking show.  We got a flow going.  Why'd you put me through?  I didn't put you through.  You fucking happy, Bert, that we get it.  It's the same fucking joke time and time again.  Well, then.  Call up and make your fucking point.  Jesus.  Fucking asshole. 
[03:38:30]  Is that it?  Hey, dude.  You're the one that called up and fucking wrecked what was going on.  Anything else?  Cut your fucking losses, dude.  Just fucking go.  Get killed.  Oh, that was ruthless.  I was hoping he would hang up.  Oh, was that ruthless? 
[03:39:00]  Angry Jimmy.  That was mean.  Wow.  That was mean Jimmy number two.  I'm sorry, mister.  Dude, I was, I was, my fucking forehead was sweating through that.  Oh, that was good.  Wow.  That was obnoxious.  Is that it?  Is that it?  Is that it?  Wow.  I'm sorry, sir.  Is that all you want to give me?  Poor guy.  Tell me to get cancer.  I hope you do die.  Fucking bag.  He's listening.  You've been part of the, uh, the angry Jimmy. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  I held up a sign before.  Mean Jimmy.  Mean Jimmy.  I like that he went to me.  Immediately went to me like that was going to fuck you.  Ah-ha.  Mean Jimmy took care of you.  I like Mean Jimmy.  Mean Jimmy.  Jimmy's brutal.  All right, let's get the fuck out of here.  Jimmy's got tickets going on sale Friday, right?  Thank you, man.  I do.
