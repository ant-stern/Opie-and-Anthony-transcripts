<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts self-deprecatingly acknowledging their status as "radio shock jocks," launching into rambling, nonsensical conversation.  They immediately discussed their recurring segments, including the provocative "Whip Him Out Wednesday," involving women flashing drivers with "wow" stickers, and the decidedly less voluntary "Butt Rub Wednesday," where E-Rock endured a butt rub from Jimmy.  The potential cancellation of "Phone Call Thursday" and the ongoing success of "Rock Scream Tuesday" were also debated, all within a framework of vulgar jokes and sexual innuendo. Opie then recounted a furious confrontation with an environmental control officer (referred to with numerous insults) he encountered while slowly cycling on a pier, highlighting his refusal to identify himself and subsequent ranting to NYPD friends who found the situation humorous.  He also mentioned a chance biking encounter with comedian Stephen Lynch and promoted their upcoming comedy tour at Mohegan Sun. Listener calls, including one detailing a car accident involving a stripper, added to the chaotic mix. The show touched upon the Chris Benoit tragedy and concluded with the mention of an unusual wedding invitation.

The broadcast continued with the hosts mocking a local news segment featuring dancing women and dry ice. They then discussed Greg/Phil Packer, a man known for being the first person interviewed at various events, regardless of his genuine interest. A graphic description of a police chase resulting in both the suspect and officer being injured followed, transitioning into a debate on the correct phrasing of "wait on line" versus "wait in line."  This was immediately followed by insults aimed at Rosie O'Donnell, stemming from her child's clothing. A lengthy discussion detailing the Chris Benoit murder-suicide dominated a large portion of this segment, exploring the emerging details of the investigation, including prescription medication and alleged growth hormone use.  The hosts engaged in extensive speculation about Benoit's motives.  Studio guests Bob Kelly and later Colin Quinn joined the show, participating in comedic banter with the hosts, which included mutual insults and jokes at Bob Kelly's expense, particularly regarding his weight.  The hosts also mocked Mike North, a Chicago radio personality who criticized them after a previous appearance on their show.  They then spent considerable time mocking a generic local morning show format, creating a stereotypical sports reporter character they called "Tank." The segment concluded with promotion of Colin Quinn and Bob Kelly's upcoming Mohegan Sun appearances.

The in-studio presence of Colin Quinn and Bob Kelly fueled further free-flowing conversation.  A caller recounted a cheap airport breakfast purchase; the hosts and guests speculated about the relationship between on-air personalities Eric and Kathy.  Extended ribbing of Bob Kelly, focusing on his weight and perceived contrast between his aspirations and reality, continued. A graphic account of a Six Flags accident involving a girl losing both feet was detailed, along with speculation about reattachment and the park's response. Anthony shared anecdotes about his difficult Central Islip childhood, including being extorted. Colin Quinn promoted his upcoming show at Caroline's.  Discussions of "Butt Rub Wednesday," "Cat Noise Wednesday," and "Camel Toe Thursday," along with impromptu enactments, featured crude humor and physical comedy involving the hosts, Bob Kelly, and an unnamed intern. The awkwardness of the "butt rub" segment was discussed.  A running gag centered on Bob Kelly's weight, culminating in the supposed unveiling of a "Fat Belly Cam."  A discussion about Hugh Grant's films and persona transitioned back into jokes about Bob Kelly's appearance. The segment was saturated with offensive jokes, insults, and sexually suggestive comments, particularly aimed at the guests' weight and appearance. Jimmy's various contributions were repeatedly discussed, and Bob Kelly shared a story about an unexpected kiss from a priest.

This part of the show featured recurring segments like "Cat Noise Wednesday," discussions about excessive merchandise brought by Jimmy (a presumably British staff member), and the creation and sale of show-related t-shirts, including rejected designs involving AIDS and rape. Listener calls followed, with one suggesting "Dog Noise Thursday."  The conversation veered into descriptions of various female body features and a graphic description of a penis deformity.  The hosts displayed and described in detail photos of a listener's growth ("Twato"), including recounting a staff member's interaction with it. Listener calls about "Hummer Tuesday" (oral sex) experiences and "midget sightings" were aired. The "What the Hell Is That?" segment, focusing on unusual body anomalies, was mentioned. The show concluded with a discussion of a carpenter who made spanking kits, leading to further sexually suggestive jokes and anecdotes about Jim Norton's childhood discipline.  The discussion included Jim Norton's upbringing and Colin Quinnâ€™s continued presence in the studio was noted.

The final segment featured "Cat Noise Tuesday" (later evolving into "Cat Noise Thursday"), with guest Roland performing various cat meows.  Discussions ranged from Maury Povich's hair to a catfight video from Brazil and ludicrous parenting guidelines.  Jimmy Jackson's parenting was also discussed. A caller with the code name "Pepperoni Nipples" contributed to the chaos. A combative discussion between Colin Quinn, Opie, and Anthony about past collaborations erupted, filled with insults and personal attacks.  References to *Seinfeld*, *According to Jim*, and *Evan Almighty*, along with various other pop culture elements, were scattered throughout.  Colin Quinn's upcoming appearances were mentioned, followed by more cat noises. The show concluded with banter, playful insults, a revelation about Jimmy's underwear, a near-physical altercation between the hosts and Colin, and a brief mention of a past incident involving Flavor Flav unexpectedly interrupting the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good. 
[00:00:30]  Go screw.  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Intimus DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  What? Hold on. Whose fault was that delay?  No. No. Oh, is it?  Correct, open, humiliated. What do you mean right in front of me? 
[00:01:00]  When you just end like that, I had to type it up. Dude, I looked at you and went boom, like go.  That was sloppy. If you had to say a celebrity that you most  resemble, who would you say? Jodie Foster? If she ate the real Jodie Foster.  Silence of the Hams.  This is where entertainment is going. I do not touch that.  The only things that may touch that is toilet paper and baby wipes.  I am right now. Oh, my God.  They are sick freaks.  How close did you get to having relations with the dog? 
[00:01:30]  You have to put oven mitts at all the German shepherds so they don't scratch the arms out.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Words.  I got a word for two.  Wake up. Wake up.  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na. Wake up.  Time to wake up.  Time.  Words hurt. 
[00:02:00]  Ah, good morning.  Look at that.  Nice and bright outside already.  Oh, that'll go away.  I can never enjoy things because I just know that they'll be going away.  Enjoy the moment, man.  Yeah, live for the moment, man.  Like, it's so nice and light out this time of year.  I get up.  Even when I'm leaving my house, I see that nice tinge of blue in the sky.  You just know light is just around the corner. 
[00:02:30]  As opposed to in the winter when it's pretty much pitch black until we leave.  Yeah, but at least you feel rested.  With our lives, I'm going to bed.  And sun almost down.  Go to bed.  It's just too weird.  I was in bed yesterday when it was still light out.  Yeah, so now I'm trying to stay up later until the sun is definitely down and you see stars in the sky.  And it makes you a little tired because you're not sleeping as much.  Yeah.  Huh?  How do you go to bed? 
[00:03:00]  I'm in bed.  Sometimes it varies, but I'm in bed.  Not asleep, but, you know, we go to bed.  Sometimes it's 7 p.m.  Other times at 9 p.m., but usually in that window somewhere.  But last night, like, I go to bed and I had to put on boogie nights and just watch that and laugh.  That could be one of the funniest movies ever made.  It's just hysterical.  When they're clothes shopping and buying all the same shirt and pants and shoes. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  And what's his name comes in and he can't fit in the shirt because he's so fat.  Who is he?  Hoffman.  Hoffman, yeah.  Oh, is that funny?  That's one of those movies I've got to watch again.  Well, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  I look at the list here and it's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  And I don't think we're doing ourselves justice by adding other themes to our Wednesday Whip  Him Out Wednesday thing.  Why we have other Wednesday things?  I didn't even realize until I got today's sheet. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, no.  Today's prep sheet.  Of course, Whip Him Out Wednesday is the big one.  That is.  This is the real one.  It's the one that started all the days of the week thing.  All these other things that we've come up in the last few weeks, they're just things to pass the time.  But Whip Him Out Wednesday is real.  Well, it's been happening for a very long time.  You know, you get the wow sticker or the wow sign or we're right in the dirt on the back of your truck or car.  And that signals the ladies out there to possibly flash you as you're driving to work. 
[00:04:30]  It's been happening for many, many years.  You mean to tell me Whip Him Out Wednesday is bigger than Rock Scream Tuesday?  Rock Scream Tuesday is taking off.  That is kind of taking off.  And that really did start as a goof.  But now people, we don't even go to all the phone calls on Tuesdays.  Oh, I know.  They just load it up with Rock Screams.  Everybody wants to just do their Rock Scream.  You mean to tell me Whip Him Out Wednesday is bigger than Phone Call Thursday?  Oh, we might be dropping Phone Call Thursday.  We had a big meeting about it yesterday. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, we did.  We don't think Phone Call Thursday is up to par.  Right.  We might replace it with something else.  We have to see how the syndicated cities feel about it.  We have trips to Chicago planned.  We're thinking of swinging by a couple of other places just to see how the locals feel about our Phone Call Thursday.  Phone Call Thursday.  Yeah, it's a big topic.  That stinks.  Well, that proves that this whole thing's a gag.  Of course.  But for some reason, this gag has taken on a life of its own.  So Whip Him Out Wednesday is real.  The ladies know. 
[00:05:30]  I'm looking at Pal Talk right now, and the ladies are already flashing.  Damn it.  Look at that, flashing this early in the morning.  Why am I just looking at Jimmy?  He's sitting right next to me, yet I pop up the Jimmy Cam.  How could you not?  Full of deliciousness and flirting.  You guys, you got the Jimmy Cam.  Anyway, here's the deal.  The ladies will do this for you.  There's a bunch of ladies that are out there now, and if they see the wow on your car, they will flash you.  All we ask is you leave the ladies alone, okay?  Yeah.  We've been asking that for years, and it works like a charm. 
[00:06:00]  They do not want to have sex with you.  No, they just want to give you a little treat on the way home, and then you both go your separate ways.  They just want to get a little risque.  Yeah.  You know, show you a little something, and then you both move on with your lives, okay?  Wow.  So it is Whip Him Out Wednesday.  It's a live and well on Pal Talk.  Maybe we'll get a few girls on the phone today telling us where they're wowing.  Also, it's Butt Rub Wednesday.  Now, how did Butt Rub Wednesday come about? 
[00:06:30]  See, because...  Butt Rub Wednesday.  Because it sounds good at the time, and then a week goes by, and you're like, why are we doing Butt Rub Wednesday?  Butt Rub.  I don't know.  And who the hell's going to Butt Rub today?  Well, apparently Jimmy and anybody that will agree.  Well, that Jimmy has to agree on.  No, no, no.  Jimmy's getting all, you know, about the whole thing.  You're getting picky about who you're Butt Rub with?  There's two choices.  The female intern or E-Rock.  And I only threw her on for appearance's sake.  E-Rock, it's you. 
[00:07:00]  E-Rock.  What are the chances of getting a Butt Rub in today?  Not very good.  Why?  Butt Rub Wednesday.  I can't trust him.  Why?  Oh, because you farted last time.  How could I not?  I had to do something silly.  Jimmy, Jimmy.  Steamy.  Jimmy, if you promise E-Rock that you won't do anything crazy.  I won't.  E-Rock?  I won't gas on you.  Jimmy will give you his word.  Yeah.  If I gas on you, I will eat three blueberries.  Ooh.  Wow.  He usually eats two.  That's not very reassuring. 
[00:07:30]  I said I'll eat three blueberries.  It doesn't get any nuttier than that.  We're starting to think that you had some kind of weird rash on your backside.  No.  Now you've got to prove that you don't have a rash.  I won't do it.  Yep.  All right?  We can start the show tonight.  That's the only way to start the show.  It's a Wednesday.  What are we going to do?  I would do it now before he starts eating all that crazy stuff that he eats.  I'll do it.  He likes half and half in your coffee, Jimmy?  No.  I don't have skim milk, but I think they screwed up today.  I put a little half and half.  E-Rock, I would do it now. 
[00:08:00]  This is your best shot at a butt rub.  Let's get it over with, sweetie.  Let's get the butt rub over with.  It's butt rub Wednesday.  And then we can move on.  Because how many butt rubs can we possibly do in one day?  I would say one.  Come on, E-Rock.  I don't know why I won.  I was going for seven.  Look, we're all half asleep.  No one's even going to remember two hours from now that he even did a butt rub.  I'll do it if we can find somebody that Jimmy will prove to do a second one today.  No.  No.  Come on, E-Rock.  Tom Chiasano.  All right.  My brother's butt rub t-shirts are almost done, but we need to keep doing butt rubs on the show. 
[00:08:30]  Got to do butt rub or else they're irrelevant.  Right.  And people won't buy them on his MySpace account, Brother Elmo.  All right.  Come on, E-Rock.  You can do butt rub t-shirts.  No.  That's another gag I started a long time ago.  He'll make a t-shirt for anything.  Come on, E-Rock.  Butt rub Wednesday.  Let's go.  I won't gas on you, and I won't turn around and slap you with my helmet.  Despite the temptation.  Butt rub.  Butt rub.  Come on, butt rub.  Butt rub.  Come on.  You got to get the hot back in the show. 
[00:09:00]  Come on, E-Rock.  Come on.  I'll tell you this much.  If he doesn't do it, then I don't tell the story of me getting a ticket from a golf cart cop.  Don't deny the show radio, Eric.  Very compelling argument, Stan.  Yeah.  Really?  Way to go, Stan.  All right.  E-Rock.  E-Rock's getting up.  Reluctantly getting up on his perch.  Reluctantly.  He wanted to yell, Yippee.  Come on.  Do it sideways.  Wait, I don't want to see your butt. 
[00:09:30]  You have to.  I really do it for the pal talk.  You got to do it for the pal talk.  It's all for the listeners.  It's not gay.  It's not gay if you're doing it for the pal talk camera.  Is he?  We'll move him.  All right.  Here we go.  Butt rub Wednesday.  We got a little Jimmy and E-Rock doing a warm butt rub.  Oh, Sam's in the way of the pal talk camera.  Yeah, Sam.  Get out of the way.  There's no organization here.  Jimmy, Jesus.  I'm just standing with my ass, hanging out, feeling fine.  Jimmy's a bit eager.  I'll do the whole show like this.  I could care less. 
[00:10:00]  Jimmy is eager.  He loves having his butt out.  Most guys, if they were forced to do this, their butt would be exposed for a half a second  tops.  All right.  Come on, Eric.  He's just standing around with his butt out.  Well, I'm waiting for Shy Boy.  All right.  Here we go.  Back it up, sweetie.  Backing up the butts.  It's butt rub Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  Here we go.  Sam with his camera video.  Quickly.  It's on pal talk.  Down.  Down.  Part of the living.  Oh, a little butt rub.  Wow.  You didn't really have your heart in that one, E-Rock.  How could you? 
[00:10:30]  It was more like a butt brush.  How could you?  Let me tell you what happens.  It seems like a good idea until you feel the warmness of another man's hiney.  His two cheeks pressing against yours.  It's a type of solidarity.  It's the warmness, though, that gets to you, right?  I don't know.  I dated a girl years ago who he used to hate when butts touched.  She hated it.  I never thought of it, but I guess it is kind of awful.  It's another fella.  Look at Steve waiting for his turn.  I think you should just split it up. 
[00:11:00]  That's all I'm saying.  Eric's been monopolizing them.  Wait.  Time to give Jill Nicolini a little love.  Well, what happened?  She's in a nice black number today.  Well, we officially got the sign now.  An update.  Jill TV.  This flat screen is now called Jill TV.  It's on Jill all the time.  We're wearing a sexy little black number with a little...  There she is.  Our favorite traffic girl.  ...thing on top.  Just pointing out the traffic.  I'd let her do a butt rub with me.  That'd be lovely.  You know what?  A Jill Nicolini butt rub would be fantastic. 
[00:11:30]  Not digging the black clothes on TV.  You can't see the curves.  No, no.  In person, you can see curves.  When she turns sideways, you can see her assets.  She blocks out Westchester.  Thank you.  Damn it.  I was going to say the West Side Highway myself.  Checking where I go.  All right.  So Jill TV is alive and well.  She's friendly today.  And of course, we screen cap her every day and we throw it up on our website.  Also on the website, pictures of our new studio as they construct it.  Every day you get to see the progress. 
[00:12:00]  How's that coming along?  They just about cleared out the old studio.  It's gutted.  It's almost an empty room at this point.  Yeah.  Those pictures are up on the website every day.  E-Rock goes over there.  Wow.  That's our old studio.  Look, it's just a pile of crap in the middle of a room.  Yeah.  It could be the day we were broadcasting that.  Yeah, exactly.  A pile of crap in the middle of the room.  That's what they think of our show.  It would be funny if that was the new room.  That's what we got.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Sit on that.  Sit on some sheetrock, you zilches.  So, I got a ticket from a golf cart cop yesterday. 
[00:12:30]  Now, all right, let's get this straight right from the top.  Jimmy knows where I'm now living.  Is it a golf cart cop or a golf cart traffic person?  Was it an actual officer of the law?  Oh, she is a plebe that works for the Environmental Control Board.  What?  Let me just put it this way.  After this all went down, I called some of my NYPD friends.  Yeah.  They just openly laughed at me on the phone. 
[00:13:00]  Openly laughed.  Well, they should.  And I didn't even call them asking for, like, you know, is there something I could do about this?  I didn't.  I really didn't.  What color was their uniform?  Green?  It was a leaf on the floor.  Like a park, yeah, with a leaf badge.  It was canary, like yellow, beige, a little bit of green.  Are you kidding me?  Dude, I almost got arrested yesterday.  You don't even understand.  How did you get a ticket?  I almost got arrested.  And I called the NYPD boys just to vent. 
[00:13:30]  And I thought I would get a little love in return.  Instead, I just got nothing but laughter on the phone.  Nothing but laughter.  And they basically said, you can rip this thing up.  This is tickets they give out to, like, vendors.  They just want to, you know, hassle.  Or some old lady that might leave a little poop on the sidewalk.  Actually, some of the NYPD that I called, I called a few of them.  They don't even know what this organization is.  The Environmental Control Board.  The woman was not a cop.  Did she have a gun?  No. 
[00:14:00]  She had a walkie-talkie, and she used it to call backup.  Backup?  Oh, no.  Which was more golf cart cops.  Oh, I hope he was making a scene.  You can't even call them golf cart cops.  That's an insult to the NYPD.  It's even an insult to the stupid meter maids out there.  This is below the meter maid crap.  Below the meter maids.  Yeah.  Oh.  So, you know, a lot of stress lately.  Moving into a new place and, you know, reworking the radio show.  Just a lot going on.  So late in the day yesterday, I'm like, you know what? 
[00:14:30]  I'm going to go for a bike ride and relieve a little stress.  So I go on a bike ride.  I run into Stephen Lynch.  It's a huge city of how many million?  And I run into Stephen Lynch.  We talk for like 15 or 20 minutes.  Would you ride over him when he was passed out to him?  Stephen?  Next time you see Stephen Lynch go, nice basket on your bike, dick.  Does he have a basket on his bike?  Dude, a huge basket on the back of his bike.  How else can he hold his booze?  No.  He's got like 24 Meister brows in it. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  A huge, huge basket on his bike.  And he sees me and he goes, hey, I'm listening to the show because of the XM, the replays, right?  I'm like, stop listening to the show, you freak.  You stalker.  How about you come on it?  Yeah, that's what I said.  Exactly.  Well, he'll be at the Mohegan Sun show on Saturday that we're doing.  So, one of the many comedians doing the comedy tour at Mohegan Sun on Saturday.  So, I laugh at his big, huge basket and he goes, oh, I got a big basket to bring my beer home. 
[00:15:30]  Yep.  Tries to make it cool, but it's still like kind of a dorky big basket.  Flowers on it.  It's tough to get a real workout in when you got a huge basket on the back of your bike.  So, at the end of my run, I decide there's this pier.  There's this pier.  I'm like, you know what?  I want to go to the end of the pier and check out the river there.  So, I go out to the end of the pier on my bike.  I ride it maybe a mile an hour.  There's not a soul on this pier.  It's late in the day. 
[00:16:00]  Uh-oh.  I go out.  I check the view.  I'm like, ah, this is kind of a cool spot.  So, then I decide to turn around.  Was there a sign?  Well, I'll get to that.  All right.  I'm just trying to see.  Honestly, I did not see any sign.  Oh, no.  Ignorance.  But, uh, power trip twat had to point out where the sign was.  Is that her name?  Yes.  Absolutely.  It's on the ticket.  So, uh, so then I'm going about a mile.  On my favorite clip.  I'm sorry.  I'm going about a mile an hour off the pier. 
[00:16:30]  And, uh, I get off the pier.  And I start, uh, on my way.  And all of a sudden, I hear, hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Like some lady losing her mind.  I'm like, what is that?  And it's the golf cart lady.  And this is like, you know, canary, yellow, green, beige looking outfit.  You stopped more out of curiosity than anything else.  Thank you, Anthony.  Because you should have just kept riding.  Well, because I'm like, what could possibly be the problem? 
[00:17:00]  Of course I stopped out of curiosity.  Would you lose your ball?  You need a title list?  What are you shooting?  To tell you the truth, I thought she was yelling at somebody else.  I'm like, what?  You know, there's no way she's yelling at me.  And I look.  And she's yelling at me.  And she's coming at me with her golf cart and stops and jumps out.  And she's like, uh, why are you riding on the pier?  She's yelling at me.  I'm like, uh, because I didn't know you couldn't.  Because it's there.  And I figured I'd ride to the end and come back. 
[00:17:30]  She goes, didn't you see the sign?  And she points to a sign, like, over in another area.  I'm like, no.  What does the sign say?  I did not see it.  You have to walk your bike on the pier.  So it's not even like you're not allowed to have bikes on the pier.  You're allowed to have a bike on the pier as long as you walk it.  Walk your bike.  I was riding mine maybe a mile in an hour.  You rebel.  You criminal.  So I'm like, all right, well, I didn't know.  Thanks for letting me know.  And I get on my bike to go.  She goes, ah, ID. 
[00:18:00]  I'm like, what?  I'm like, you're joking, right?  She goes, no, ID.  I go, I don't carry an ID.  I mean, I'm riding my bike.  She goes, I'll take a verbal.  What's your name?  A verbal.  I'm like, I'm not giving you my name.  All of a sudden, she calls backup on her walkie-talkie and more golf cart twats come flying into the area.  How was her backup call?  What did she say?  Something.  Did she say we got a 136 or something?  Was there a code word?  All I heard was peer, hurry up, get here, a-hole in front of me type of thing. 
[00:18:30]  I don't know.  I don't remember the code thing.  So then there's a backup lady that's looking all tough.  I'm like, this is a joke, right?  I thought this was like a can of camera or something.  Racial background of both women?  Why don't you figure it out?  Why don't you figure it out?  Let me think.  Okay.  It's figured.  All right.  Very good.  Wow.  It took you a long time.  So you're giving time for each one.  So I go, why do you need my name?  Why do you need this verbal name thing? 
[00:19:00]  And she goes, because I'm giving you a ticket.  I'm like, wait, can't you let me go?  I didn't know, obviously, why would I do this if I knew?  I just moved into the area, which is the God's honest truth.  Can you let me go?  And this is when it just pissed me off.  She goes, if I let you go, then what is the purpose of my job?  Exactly.  I'm like, you're kidding, right?  So now we're going at it big time.  I'm like, I ain't giving you my name.  I'll give you a verbal.  Jim Norton. 
[00:19:30]  That's what I would have done.  Oh, would I have done that?  And you know what?  I was this close to giving your name knowing that you would never be on a bike.  No, why would I be?  Yeah.  So I'm like, I paid that ticket.  Right.  Knowing I'd be on the pier, I know better.  So Al, I walk my bike on the pier.  So Al better be ready down the hall.  I'm like, you're really writing me a ticket for going a mile an hour on a pier?  I'll be ready.  You're giving me a ticket?  She goes, yes, I am.  Yeah. 
[00:20:00]  Can't you let me go?  No.  I mean, she's losing her mind.  Like, acting all tough.  She wants to be a cop, but obviously she'll never be a cop.  Oh, of course not.  So she's on this big, huge power trip.  So she's writing out the ticket.  I give her my real name because I don't know if somehow this is connected to the real boys,  the NYPD, and I could get into some real trouble.  And they rely on that, by the way, like that fear that you did.  They rely on the fact that you're not too sure how connected they are.  I really, I mean, I wimped out and gave her my real name because I don't know if there's 
[00:20:30]  some strange connection with the guys that do the real work out there.  Legally, you actually can punch her off her golf cart.  You know, dude, it got close to some serious crap.  I'm telling you right now because her attitude was ridiculous.  I mean, it was, what's wrong?  What happened?  I don't know.  It's Sal.  Oh, what's up?  We're on the air, Sal.  In the middle of a pretty good story.  Yeah.  No, unless it's like life-threatening. 
[00:21:00]  All right.  As long as the family's okay, then I have to do a radio show.  All right, Sal.  I'll call you on a break.  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  He doesn't know you do a radio show yet.  You know how, like, parents are?  They don't get this.  They think we're, like, in a clubhouse in a tree somewhere, like, putting on a show for  our friends.  But when you see a family number pop up during the show, you're like, yeah, I had to answer.  I had to answer.  No, I understand. 
[00:21:30]  You know, especially this early, I'm thinking, all right, I got to leave.  Someone's dead.  But, no.  I thought it was a phone call from someone saying, shut up, Opie.  No one cares.  No.  Continue.  I love these stories because there are so many of these organizations out there that throw around  this fake authority.  Well, one of my NYPD friends said that this is a scam as a way that the city can bring  in a little money for ridiculous things.  Because it's like, she was treating me like I exposed myself to kids or was selling drugs 
[00:22:00]  openly on the streets, something.  I'm like, I was going.  What?  How do you know what those treatments are?  Yeah.  I, yeah.  I, yeah.  I, yeah.  Oh, well, I.  But I'm sitting there like, she's yelling at me and giving me the business because I  was going one mile an hour on a pier that no one was on.  And obviously, it's not even well marked.  It's a sign with a, with a, um, uh, a temporary, like, fence on the other side because there's  many ways to hit this pier.  Right?  So, finally, she's writing the ticket. 
[00:22:30]  And I'm like, just give me the ticket.  She goes, don't you want to know how to take care of it?  I'm like, no.  Give me the ticket.  Take care of it.  I'm like, give me the ticket.  So, she gives me the ticket.  She goes, have a nice day.  And Al, I hope you're ready because I looked her right in the eye, made sure we had eye  contact.  And I go, can you do a letter?  Blow me.  Oh, no.  Wow.  And then she got on her walkie talkie again.  I don't know who the hell she was calling.  Do they have somebody that, uh.  Well, that's what.  That responds when you tell, uh, one of these women to, um, give you little sexual favors? 
[00:23:00]  Look, man, you say that to the NYPD, you know, you're going down.  Oh, yeah.  That's obvious.  But I'm like, you know what?  No way.  No way.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  But I looked her right in the eye and I said that.  Blank me.  I'm like, blank me.  Yeah.  And I took off.  And then I got back to my, uh, my apartment.  I called all the NYPD guys just to rant.  And they're all like laughing openly at me.  That is a joke.  You got a ticket from a golf cart twat.  They were, they were calling her that. 
[00:23:30]  That's how, that's how I came up with that little saying today.  So it's the environmental control board.  $50 ticket for, for, uh, for, uh, for, I, I observed respondent riding bicycle on pier.  Oh, God.  Signs are clearly posted that you're not allowed to do this.  You have to walk your bike.  That's in the details of violation.  What a loser.  I want to know what happens if you, like, with traffic cops, I know they do have a certain 
[00:24:00]  amount of authority.  They're not cops.  There's traffic, whatever they are.  Yeah, whatever they are.  Because, but they are standing in the middle of the street controlling traffic.  I mean, they're doing something that the NYPD, they're probably giving them cop, real cops  a break so they don't have to stand there and control traffic.  What would have happened if you just refused to give this woman any information until a real  cop showed up?  I, uh, no, I would have just taken off at that point.  But, I mean, what would happen if you said, I'm not giving you any information, drop dead,  call whoever you want.  And then if a real cop came, you give him whatever he wants.  Well, here's the other problem.  I know I'm going to be doing a lot of biking in that area, so I know, like, if I just took 
[00:24:30]  off, which I could easily, I could easily out-bike a stupid golf cart.  They put an APP out on you?  Well, I'd be in that area enough where they would, you know, they would eventually get me  for whatever.  There's a wave to her every time.  Hey.  But as she's running the ticket, I'm saying stuff like, wow, you must have a miserable life.  Yeah, because as soon as they start writing the ticket, you know, in the middle of writing  the ticket, they're not going to go, you know what, I changed my mind, I will give you a  warning.  As soon as they start writing, that means start insulting the hell out of them, especially 
[00:25:00]  if they're one of these, you know, one of these, these, these things.  What would happen if they don't do anything important for the city?  You should have videotaped her.  It's not even about the money.  I know, but how much?  It's only $50.  She goes, oh, that's ridiculous.  Yeah.  But I just started, oh, you must have a miserable life.  Boy, you're really tough.  How's that career going?  Thought you'd be one of Charlie's angels, didn't you?  Saying all sorts of stuff like that.  And here you are, writing me a ticket for riding my bicycle.  I did say, what's the matter?  Not good enough to make the actual police force? 
[00:25:30]  Oh, that gets it.  And that's when she looked at me like she thought she had me, hands over the ticket.  Have a nice day.  I go, blank me.  Blank me.  They hear that from people.  I had a good traffic guy.  These people never give you a break because they want the power of cops.  But cops will a lot of times give you a break if you're driving.  Hey, man, I got to get through this barrack.  Like if they're blocking off a great route.  Yeah, they're like, all right, go ahead.  I'm doing a show down here.  The ones that won't are those scum that are not real cops. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  They just love the power.  They have no power in their real lives.  And that's where they feel good.  That's why I turn.  I don't make eye contact with them.  A lot of times when traffic is a little heavy on 57th and I have to turn on to 57th,  they will make people go up one of the other avenues.  And it takes me so far out of the way.  So I just start making the turn.  And they'll go like, hey, hey.  And I won't make eye contact.  I'll just continue making my turn.  And you're gone. 
[00:26:30]  Go right past them.  They jump in front of you sometimes.  I've seen them do that to people.  Oh, good, good.  Jump in front of me.  Well, now because, you know.  Put it in reverse.  Go around them.  I'm new to the area.  Now I know the deal.  If these stupid golf cart twats yell out to me, I'm just going to keep going really fast  and just out bike them and go, I didn't hear no stupid golf cart horn.  I got pulled over by a golf cart.  And you had to call golf cart backup.  That seems like it would ruin the environment more than a bicycle.  The golf carts.  Right.  Are they propane golf carts? 
[00:27:00]  Are they battery powered?  Either way, you know, they're using power.  You're just trying to help the environment, riding your little bicycle.  Just a complete power-tripped twat.  Has a little power.  And she's going to control the pier.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What's wrong?  So many ways.  Oh.  They just grab money from people in this city.  Oh, that's getting dumped every time?  Yep.  Every time?  What is?  Yeah.  The T word.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That one's been on the list for a while. 
[00:27:30]  All right.  Well, whatever.  I'll get some down the hall.  So there you go.  There's my little afternoon yesterday when I was just trying to let off a little steam.  Which?  It got a little ugly.  A little ugly.  Good.  A little ugly.  I wasn't going to let her get the upper hand in the air.  Don't give them any respect.  I want to know from a cop, though, what would have happened if you just refused to give her  any information?  Like, not do anything threatening towards her, but just refuse to acknowledge that she was  talking to you.  Yeah.  Would she have to just call, like, a real cop?  Which probably would annoy him. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, the cop.  He would take his time.  He wouldn't deal with that.  And by the way.  He's fighting real stuff in this city.  I do have a problem with your story.  Why?  Were you carrying ID, or were you just telling her you didn't have ID?  No, I didn't have ID.  All right.  What the f-  What are you doing?  What?  I'm serious.  What?  You carry ID with you all the time.  Not when I'm biking in my-  Yes, when you're biking.  I don't carry ID.  Why wouldn't you carry your ID?  Here's a scenario. 
[00:28:30]  Something happens.  You're laying there.  They don't know who the f-  You are.  And now you get taken to a hospital.  No one knows who to call for a medical proxy.  No one knows anything.  No one knows if you're insured or anything.  They throw you in some hell hole, and you wind up croaking.  You've got to have your ID with you 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  When you are out, you constantly have your ID with you.  Thanks, Buzzkill.  I'm just saying that's very important that you carry your ID.  I was just going for a leisurely bike ride. 
[00:29:00]  Doesn't matter.  Kenny, tell him.  I don't need ID, right, Kenny?  Tell him he should-  Kenny.  Let's be honest.  Kenny will tell you now, as an officer of the law, what repercussions of not having an ID.  Go ahead, Kenny.  Anthony, I'm not an officer of the law.  But former.  Anthony.  Be honest.  You were always right, and Opie is always right.  Shouldn't people carry ID-  Let's say it's not Opie. 
[00:29:30]  Look, man.  Shouldn't people carry their ID with them at all times?  Look, people should make a good account for themselves.  Look, if your scenario comes to, you know, tuition.  Tuition.  Tuition.  If you have to pay for school during that.  It doesn't matter.  It's pronunciation Friday.  Yeah, Friday.  I know.  It doesn't matter at that point.  No, no, because you might live, but you might be a vegetable.  Right.  Great.  You might maybe have spinal injuries. 
[00:30:00]  Let's say hi to Jay in Connecticut.  Jay, what's up?  Always.  Jay.  Yes.  What's up?  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  You know you're going to be on a federal watch list now.  You're not going to be able to fly anywhere.  Is that where they put you?  Really?  The golf cart.  I think you should pay your fine in pennies.  That old gag.  That old gag.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Why don't we take a break?  Well, that got the phones lit.  I would love to hear from a cop, though, if any could call in.  Dan, the cops don't have to show ID. 
[00:30:30]  Phil and Boston got the same kind of ticket.  Should pay homeless guys to ride bikes on pier.  Hey, that's not a bad idea.  Mall security has more authority.  Mall security.  I met a stripper, gave her my car.  She crashed it.  Got a Hummer yesterday for Hummer Tuesday.  Wow.  Asked girls in Pittsburgh to wow us.  We got lots of phone calls to get to next.  Our phone number, 877-212-5762.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning. 
[00:31:00]  You're listening to Opie and Anthony with Wool, Jimmy Norton.  I want to say good morning to Long Island.  Yes.  We just assume they're on board because we're from there.  I got to tell you, the ratings for Long Island, we destroyed.  We destroyed on Long Island.  Yep.  This past month.  Did okay in New York City.  Company's very happy with New York City.  Yeah, we're right up there, man.  And Chicago's showing another tick. 
[00:31:30]  Up tick.  Another up tick.  I think six months in a row, a little up tick for Chicago.  Nothing to brag about.  We keep it honest on this show.  We started with nothing, and now with six months in a row with a little up tick, it's  starting to look like a little something-something in Chicago.  I'm very happy with Chicago.  We continue in that direction.  So good morning to everyone listening on WCKG.  Hey, we got our big comedy show on Saturday at the Mohegan Sun.  Bob Kelly's coming in today.  We're going up Thursday night, broadcasting Friday morning from the Wolf Den in Connecticut, 
[00:32:00]  which is in the Mohegan Sun.  And then Saturday, we got the great show, man, with Bobby, who'll be on the show, myself,  Otto and George, Stephen Lynch, Patrice.  It's all the guys you know from the show.  Yes, Kenny.  You just distracted me.  I'm sorry.  Fans understand they can come and watch the broadcast Friday morning, right?  Absolutely.  If you want a lot of friends.  Friends.  Friends.  A lot of friends.  Friends.  I don't know if we're going to find enough friends in time.  Mail and...  How about Fran Healy?  We need some mails and some friends. 
[00:32:30]  No, it's going to be a great weekend.  Gambling, everything, the whole thing.  Oh, yeah.  Well, just keep listening to the Wolf.  They're telling you how you could see us broadcast live this Friday.  From the Wolf Den.  That was six months of positivity from Kenny.  That was our positivity quote.  Oh, yeah.  For the summer.  Everything else will be doom and gloom.  It's going to be great.  And you guys can't see his face, but his eyes, the smile can't even hit his eyes.  It'll be great.  And by his eyes, he's like, no one will come.  You know what's cool about this tour? 
[00:33:00]  Yes, brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  Yes.  The inherent things.  Bud Light.  As we talk here.  The tour, it's cool.  Every stop, it's a little different.  That's why a lot of our fans, our pests, are going to multiple shows, because this one's  in a casino, so you get that whole casino element around the comedy show.  Speaking of which, there's no tailgating or ONA Village because it's in a casino, but  you'll see us at the tables on Thursday night and Friday night and just having a good old 
[00:33:30]  time.  Hang out.  Watch us lose money.  Looking forward to this.  Phil, who's up there in Connecticut, one of the pests up there, he wants us to announce  this.  It's a tailgate party at Mohegan Sun on Saturday at the Grand, at the Grand, Grand?  Ground?  Okay.  At the Ground Lot.  At the Ground Lot by the hotel starting at noon.  Please announce this so we can have a gathering.  So there you go.  I have a question.  Yeah.  Because I'm going to be gone with you guys up in Connecticut.  My girlfriend's moving.  And I won't be here to help.  Yeah.  Uh, so she's on Craigslist looking for movers and she called like a two men with a van. 
[00:34:00]  Oh boy.  Oh no.  Would you?  I'm like, I'll help you put your couch in here.  Would you?  That doesn't sound very safe.  Thank you.  No, it's not a good one.  What?  No.  No.  I'm afraid.  That's murder.  I told you that.  Those are two murderers.  I'll never see you again.  Waiting to find an attractive girl to rape and murder.  I don't like the idea she's on Craigslist. 
[00:34:30]  Don't let a Craigslist.  They're sitting wherever they are going, can you believe someone actually bought into our scam?  Jimmy, do you understand there are movers?  There's companies that move you.  She doesn't have much furniture.  She has, I mean, I'll pay for you.  It doesn't matter.  It's like all kinds of small, even a small move.  They bring a small truck.  They load it up.  They're reputable movers.  Whether it's, you know, one of the places here, local in New York City.  You see there are trucks all over the place.  You call them up. 
[00:35:00]  They'll give you an estimate on what you have.  And then they will move you.  They won't rape and kill you like someone from Craigslist.  She has a very small amount of furniture.  If anybody has a moving company, I would love to get information.  I'm really nervous about this.  Because she's like, yeah, I was on Craigslist.  They want 85 bucks an hour plus 10 bucks a floor.  I'm like, that's fine for it.  That's too cheap almost.  Yeah.  It doesn't.  Yeah.  It's two ex-cons.  One who has a stolen van probably has a sock with blood in it somewhere.  Well, does she have a friend, a.k.a. 
[00:35:30]  witness, that could help her that day?  I don't know.  I actually want to help her move.  I'm depressed I won't be here.  But then it might be Sunday.  I might be back already.  And then I'll have to, like, make an excuse.  What's the name of the moving company?  Benoit Moving?  Oh, God.  Oh.  Oh, too soon?  Yeah, of course.  Oh, God.  I didn't even get that.  No, we'll get into that story.  It's pre-pillers.  That story is getting more and more twisted by the day.  A bunch of phone calls really fast.  We've got Tracy in Tucson.  Tracy, what's up?  That's not a real ticket. 
[00:36:00]  You need to pay for that with Monopoly money.  Oh, from the Environmental Control Board?  We're riding a mile an hour on a pier.  Yeah, great.  A fake ticket.  Pay for it with fake money.  Thank you, Tracy.  They don't even have handcuffs.  They just tie you up with hemp until the police come.  John, who works for the NYPD.  These are the guys we support, not these fake cops that almost look like  that they have the same uniforms as the NYPD.  What's up, John?  Guys, what's up?  Good morning.  Good morning.  I checked in late. 
[00:36:30]  I caught the telegram.  Tell me, who got this ticket?  I didn't.  Opie, yeah.  Come on.  You're kidding me.  You're on a pier, and you got stopped by a golf cart with a traffic agent.  Is this the story?  No, I think this lady is below a traffic agent.  I think this lady is below a meter maid, to be honest with you.  Well, the only thing you can tell me.  This is what I got last night, just NYPD guys.  The only thing you did wrong was stop it.  Well, let me ask you.  Yeah.  You did everything else right.  You were riding on the pier when you weren't supposed to. 
[00:37:00]  You had it all right.  The only thing you did wrong was stop.  Someone went to their website.  You know that they don't even use real judges, or the judges don't wear robes.  They don't even hear your case in a courtroom.  It's in, like, just a room somewhere downtown.  They don't even get the respect down there, this organization.  Well, the best thing is when you're in the courtroom, and people call them your honor.  Hey, John.  Let me ask you a question.  They're administrative judges.  That's all they are.  What would happen? 
[00:37:30]  All right, John.  Listen for a second.  John, what would happen if Open said, I'm not giving you any information, I don't know  what you do or what your job is, until a real cop shows up?  What would happen if a real cop showed up, then?  Well, a cop that shows in the scene has a wider scope of what he can do with you.  Oh, of course.  Yeah, I know that.  You have to understand, a summons is in lieu of arrest.  So, if he wanted to, you accompany him to the station house, and he goes up and down  with a wire check, and he does all the bells and whistle checks. 
[00:38:00]  No, no, but I mean, if you said to her, I'm not telling you any information, and then  a cop showed up, and you're like, you'll tell the cop anything he wants to know.  First of all, a cop isn't going to show up.  No, I knew that.  Well, that's the end of the story.  All right, you know what?  You know what?  I'm hitting the pier tonight.  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  Going to give it another whirl.  Absolutely.  Collect these things.  I think you should get the whole team and all get on bikes and ride them.  You know what I want to have happen? 
[00:38:30]  I want to hit the pier, same lady in her golf cart, she calls the backup, and now I'm  on the bike path with just a whole slew of golf carts chasing me.  Of golf carts chasing you.  Oh, what a chase that would be.  Like I've seen in every bad 80s college movie.  Yeah.  Before you go, before you go, let me just say this in closing.  Yeah.  The rule of thumb when you're dealing with these traffic agents, and I've gotten parking  tickets by these buffoons.  Once they put that pen there, don't even go out there and say a word. 
[00:39:00]  Right.  Because they can't wait for you to come out there and challenge them.  Right.  Because you're feeding into their frenzy.  The best bet, let them race, and get out of there.  Just take the ticket and go.  In this case, when they stop you, that's a different story.  You keep going.  Yeah, you know what, these type of things, I don't even know what to call them, frustrate  the hell out of me.  The meter maids, and they're meter maids, what pisses me off is that they make them look 
[00:39:30]  like you guys now.  They got the NYPD uniform on because when they were wearing their cute little brown outfits,  they got a lot of abuse.  So now people are like, oh, wow, I've got to respect this person, and he's part of the  NYPD.  It was a trade-off.  The fire department got EMS, the police department got the child brigade.  And I see these people in my neighborhood just walking around just waiting to ruin someone's  day.  They're sitting at meters just waiting to see a click to no time left.  To go one minute over. 
[00:40:00]  They can't wait to start writing.  I mean, and they're just all on a bunch, they're on power trips because they want to  be part of the real, the real NYPD.  What they should be doing is like getting like on those, on like those roads, like 53rd Street  or 54th Street or 55th, getting those trucks that double park and wreck traffic and dealing  with cabs who stop when they could pull over to a curb, but still stop.  That's who they, those are traffic menaces.  That's who they should be dealing with. 
[00:40:30]  Oh no, red alert, red alert.  Opie and Anthony being too local for New York City.  Every single city relates to that.  You tell me Philly don't have traffic cops?  How are they going to relate to this in Grand Rapids, Michigan?  Call their agent, call their agent.  Red alert.  One of the better days in a cop's car is when he reads in a paper that one of these traffic  agents got locked up.  There you go.  See, I knew that's how you guys think.  It kind of balances everything out.  All right, thank you, sir.  All right, guys, enjoy. 
[00:41:00]  All right.  Let's say hi to Mark in Syracuse.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Just wanted to thank you for reinstating Hummer Tuesday.  Oh, yes, Hummer Tuesday.  But I want to bet for the next 12 Tuesdays to get another Hummer if I called up and talked  to you guys.  So it worked like a charm?  What's that?  I don't know why I just said worked like a charm.  Worked like a charm.  I have a Hummer charm. 
[00:41:30]  Mark, new listener to the show?  Yeah, I've been listening for the last month like what you guys are doing and just wanted  to thank you for Hummer Tuesday.  So did the lady hear that we were talking about Hummer Tuesday and she decided to go for  it?  Oh, yeah.  Awesome.  Here's the kicker.  She bet me that I wouldn't call up the show and talk to you guys.  Right.  And she bet me another 12 Hummers for the next 12 Tuesdays.  Well, of course.  We heard that at the beginning of the story, sir. 
[00:42:00]  Yes, yes.  What an obscure number 12.  Yes.  12.  Three months.  Maybe you should have taken care of her with your useless mouth.  Well, good luck to you.  Keep up your good nature.  That is true, sir.  Your mouth has become a kettle of boredom.  Your mouth is as useful as a skin tag.  That's what it is.  The skin tag with a hole in it with sound spilling out.  Well, we did ask for phone calls from guys that were lucky enough to get something on Hummer 
[00:42:30]  Tuesdays.  Yeah.  Your story was hotter about being on the pier.  In the next 12 Tuesdays, I got promised if I called up the show.  Shut up.  Did you?  He got a little scared and hung up.  He's sweet.  All right.  Do we have time for one more?  We got to take another break.  You want to hear from Matt in Vegas?  Yeah.  I want more.  All right.  Matt, what's up?  Thanks for tying me in after that guy.  Yeah.  Help us out, Matt. 
[00:43:00]  Bring the crowd back.  Hey, guys, I need some advice.  Okay.  I got a stripper girlfriend I've been seeing for a couple of weeks down here in Vegas.  She strips at Cheetahs.  Today, she has to borrow my car.  I run a car lot.  The SRT8.  So, I don't get a call back from her that she's getting off work.  She's stripping from 1 to 9.  And it's 11 p.m., about to go to sleep.  I took a car home from the lot. 
[00:43:30]  And I get a call from her cousin saying she's in the hospital.  They're doing CAT scans on her.  Totally DUI.  Totally wrecked my car.  And God, I hope she's all right.  I don't know this girl very well.  But what the fuck do I do?  What the ass do I do?  You're a dummy.  You really are a dummy.  Why would you give a stripper a car?  And I'm thinking, this girl is very intelligent. 
[00:44:00]  Because he wants to go out with her.  Yeah.  Very intelligent girl.  No.  No.  Two little girls.  I've been, you know, we've been going out.  Kind of got the family thing going.  And I'm thinking, oh, man, I'm going to be the gentleman.  This girl doesn't have a car.  I'm going to help her out.  And she gets hammered and crashes it.  Hammered at work at Cheetahs.  They're not supposed to drink at work.  Dude, here's what you...  I'm sorry to interrupt you, bro.  But here's what you give a stripper.  Give her a big red ball and say,  let her bounce this, stupid. 
[00:44:30]  Let her bounce it and smile  and make ball bouncing noises  and go tee-hee-hee.  You don't give her a car.  They're all drunk.  Yeah, most of them are drunks or drug addicts.  Most.  You're just kind of dumb, Matt.  Yeah, you're a little full of lust.  You shouldn't do much more than get a lap dance.  It's probably all hot.  The guy's like in lust.  Give a fat girl your car.  She'll have it washed.  Yeah.  That's a good idea.  Yeah, just give a fat girl your car.  That thing will come back in perfect shape. 
[00:45:00]  It'll come back detailed.  Yeah.  What do I do?  I noticed your belt was squealing.  I tightened it up a little bit.  Oh, man.  She'll wax your entire car.  Yeah.  John's still on the line.  What's that?  What?  What can I do?  What are my options?  I mean, the car's insured for me, full coverage.  There are no options.  You're screwed.  Yeah.  Yeah, you made a stupid move.  We got a call up and say she stole...  The report is stolen.  Yeah, there you go.  Learn your lesson and stop falling in love with strippers.  Yeah.  That's Vegas.  Come on, guys. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, it's Vegas.  They're all strippers.  Yeah, of course.  That's...  All right, Matt.  Good luck to you.  Yeah, good luck.  I got no advice there.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  All right.  Just made a bad decision.  He'll do it again.  Huh?  He'll do it again.  I would.  Guys that fall in love with strippers are like the goofiest bunch of gentlemen.  What is the upside there?  It ain't going to work.  She's not going to leave the business.  It's not Hollywood.  It's not a movie.  She's going to keep just being a whoring around, doing dope, drinking, and crashing your cars. 
[00:46:00]  There you go.  By the way, that guy from Syracuse, CM Mark, writes on the instant feedback, his mouth is as useless as Karen Meyer's ears.  Ooh.  A little local for Chicago.  Also, someone from their cell phone.  Hey, did Opie get a ticket from the FIC?  Oh, the FIC.  Hey, do we have any more Karen Meyer?  We haven't played her in a long time.  Yeah, we ought to get some of that.  A death reporter from Chicago who does all the human interest stories with injuries and handicap. 
[00:46:30]  She does the injury stories.  Yeah.  She does the ones where people are hurt.  Well, it's funny that you bring up Karen Meyer.  I was just getting one of her newest stories.  Ah, Danny.  Danny.  Hey.  Good boy.  Isn't that funny that Danny gets him?  Yeah.  Mentally disabled Danny.  Yeah.  And also, a lot of people asking, especially Booby Man from Brooklyn, are you guys going to mess with iPhone guy today?  Uh, I just saw, uh, our favorite, uh, CW11.  Right.  Down there. 
[00:47:00]  Right.  At the Apple store.  Right.  And there seems to be a lot more people there.  There's a guy at the front of the line.  They showed.  Talked to him yesterday.  He's a fat, disgusting mess with no shirt on, sitting there with, with just covered in hair.  And he's a mess.  He should be spoken to.  And then there's some girls on the line.  The line has gotten longer.  Now, as, uh, Friday comes about, the 29th, the big day that they release the iPhone.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  So why don't we send some people down there? 
[00:47:30]  Absolutely.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We'll figure that out.  And, uh, let's get into the Chris Benoit thing for a little bit after the break.  Absolutely.  Gruesome.  Let's get into something a little more gruesome.  This guy had a very, very busy weekend.  The details are just disturbing as hell.  Yeah.  Really uncomfortable.  And thank you, by the way, for the wedding invitation.  I don't know who you are.  Someone sent me a wedding invitation.  I got the same thing.  Oh, we all got one.  Who are they?  Don't feel special.  And here's something for everybody that's getting married out there.  Stop with the ridiculous fonts where you can't even read what's written. 
[00:48:00]  Everything has circles.  Like calligraphy.  Right.  That cannot be written.  It's like this person wrote out their wedding invites with a spirograph.  It's in Woodbury, New York.  How can you?  Woodbury Island.  Jimmy.  I don't know who it is.  I don't know who it is.  Jimmy.  I'm scared.  You're a Jersey boy.  We're huge in Woodbury.  Okay, but I don't know who these people are.  Blowing up in Woodbury.  Is it Ted Woodbury and his wife?  Do they own the town?  I don't know who they are.  It is the most curly Q-like font. 
[00:48:30]  It was, like I said, written with a spirograph.  There's so many like circles.  Curly Qs.  How do you add circles to a T?  They did.  They did, though.  So we're still trying to figure out who the hell you are that sent the invites in to us.  Wow.  Yeah.  The girls dancing on CW 11.  This is CW 11 News.  This is news?  We were commenting and Than started laughing because as these New Jersey Nets dancers, finalists, 
[00:49:00]  are dancing, there was a smoke coming out of a dry ice fog machine.  And Than just was like, it's a dry ice fog machine on the news.  On the news.  Like, you shouldn't have that.  I think they're the most honest news, though.  They know who they are.  This is what it is.  They know who they are.  This is just what it is.  They know they're not going to compete with CNN or Fox or anything.  So they just have to go with dancing girls.  Look at this.  And Jill Nicolini.  This could easily be something you see in a strip club right there. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Look at that.  Well, a strip club uptown.  Well, the way they film the basketball net behind them.  There's a basketball net.  Looks like a pole.  Looks like a pole because they cut the net off.  They're not stupid.  They're smart.  They're smart.  All right.  And we'll talk about your video of the day next, even though it's a radio.  But it's a doozy.  You'll see it on TV.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Bob Kelly has joined the program.  We've got lots going on today.  We're going to send someone down to the line. 
[00:50:00]  A lot of people waiting online for their iPhones.  Yep.  And then just point out a guy, a fat guy, a very fat guy that's hairy with a mustache that is shirtless.  And they're interviewing him on the local news station here.  He's a fan of our show.  That guy, this is what's so funny about that guy.  His whole gig in life is to be first online for things.  For anything?  He's actually very famous, but the media still doesn't understand they're interviewing the same guy every time.  His whole job, and I've talked to him. 
[00:50:30]  He's from Huntington.  He's got press clippings of being the guy that's first online, the guy that shows up at McDonald's when Clinton went there.  So does he care about anything that he's online for?  No, not at all.  This is his thing.  This has been his thing for years.  They even wrote an article on him.  So like the Daily News or somebody in New York is on to him.  But the rest of the media is not on to this guy.  He continues to pull this off.  They continue to interview him like he's the first online, like he's a tech geek. 
[00:51:00]  He's not.  He's just some dude from Huntington who actually loves the show, goes to all our stuff.  And his thing is to be first online to be interviewed.  He's got like tons of videotape of the media interviewing him for all sorts of things.  He's the first guy that's online for Yankee playoff tickets, Met playoff tickets, Devil's playoff tickets when they make it, whatever.  Whatever it is, he shows up.  Well.  He's been scamming the media for years.  And they just interviewed him on the local news station here in New York. 
[00:51:30]  And they don't have a clue.  It's the same guy.  What a star.  Same guy, Greg.  I think his last name is Packer or Packer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Phil Packer.  Greg Packer, I believe.  So I think the guy's awesome because he gets away with us every single time.  Every time.  What's there to get away with?  He just shows up first.  Dude, he figured out a way.  He's got no life.  But it's his thing.  He works for the city.  It's his thing.  He gets time off.  He works for the city.  Yeah.  He gets time off and this is what he does. 
[00:52:00]  What does he do?  He's got press clippings that are ridiculous.  He's the first online for just about everything that happens in the New York area.  Yeah, I understand he's a fan.  I understand he does that.  That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard of.  I was an ass.  But people come up with their thing.  My thing is I'm not first online.  Right.  Easy.  I want to be...  I wait and get it.  Oh, they pan down on Jill.  Look.  Look how good she looks.  Even in black.  Oh, they pan back up.  Damn it.  Yeah, well, they're not brave enough to pan down for too long.  Yeah, pan all the way down.  Can I ask the question here? 
[00:52:30]  The freaking camera right under the...  The soccer module start that.  It's on Jill on TV.  You know...  What are you trying to do to me and my children as we watch the news in the morning?  A bad example for the women and girls in this country.  That is not attainable.  Well, shut up.  Copy, paste, copy, paste, copy, paste every women's organization in the world.  This is unacceptable.  Blind CC.  Blind CC.  Blind CC. 
[00:53:00]  They're not brave enough to show that hotness.  They can only go so far with Jill's hotness.  Look, look, Bob.  It's Jill TV.  Well...  We have a whole TV dedicated to the traffic drone here in New York.  How pathetic are we?  Oh, here's my favorite clip.  Clip of the day.  Clip of the day.  And why do they keep cutting it off?  God damn it.  Don't tease it.  Show it, Fox.  Anthony.  Anthony, that was the coming up tease.  Trust me, they've shown it about 12 times already. 
[00:53:30]  I want to watch it another 12 times.  Let's explain the video of the day.  Well, a young gentleman seems to have been caught up in a misunderstanding.  And the police might have thought he was guilty of something as he ran from them.  So the police, one policeman was chasing him on foot.  He kind of stumbled, got up, and started running the other way.  The cop went to chase him again as a police cruiser car was pulling up and ran right into 
[00:54:00]  the guy and, unfortunately, ran into the officer who sustained it.  It looked like some type of leg injury.  But the gentleman, the perp, the perp that was being chased, he flew and smashed onto the  pavement where he was knocked the F out.  He just got knocked out, laid there, not even moving.  What kind of injuries?  Do we know yet? 
[00:54:30]  I have no idea, but it's a fantastic clip.  The interesting part of the clip is the cop who's still just working on adrenaline, was  still able to move, and then realized, oh, God, my leg.  My leg is really screwed up.  It's kind of like chopping a chicken's head off.  It'll run around a little bit.  Yeah, it runs around a little, and they go, oh, I have no head.  I have no head.  What am I doing?  Well, I'm just going to lay down.  The cop continued to run and do his thing, and all of a sudden realized, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that hurt my leg.  I was just hit by a car.  And then he went down, which isn't cool. 
[00:55:00]  Great clip, though.  That perp flies and just hits the pavement and ragdolls it.  It doesn't move.  Yeah.  Hey, Opie, could you get it right, please?  You don't wait on line for something.  You wait in line for something.  That big controversy.  Now, see, when I wait in â€“ wait.  No, you wait on line.  There's an imaginary line, and you're standing on it.  You're on line.  I'm on line.  You can't get into a line. 
[00:55:30]  Draw a line.  Draw a line.  Get in it.  Get in it.  Well, the line is seen as being the entity of people, and you're seen as being in that  entity of people.  What if you're last in line?  Then you're on the â€“ you're in line.  Well, they would say you're last on line, but I say in line because I always looked at  it as an imaginary line.  We say in line.  They say in line.  We say on line.  You just stole â€“ you just stole what he said and made it yours. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  Now it's yours.  That's why you're last on line.  You're not in the line.  You're at the end of it, so you're not technically in it.  Last in line.  Shut up.  That's what they say.  No.  The D.O. song.  Don't care.  Ronnie doesn't sing last on line.  No.  That's the last in line.  No, he's English, isn't he?  No.  You're standing on an imaginary line.  No, he's not.  I say I'm in queue.  How about this?  Who gives us â€“  I say I'm standing in the vicinity of the gang.  Who gives a â€“  All right, listen.  Chris Benoit. 
[00:56:30]  Can I just â€“  Before we get to Benoit, can I ask one question, please?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How much attention does Rosie O'Donnell need?  More than any other person on the globe.  How much attention does this fat bitch need?  She's just in a little trouble today because her kid's wearing some army stuff.  Is it a protest thing?  Yeah, of course.  I'm sure it is.  Because the kid was dressed up like in some kind of â€“ almost looked Muslim-y.  Of course.  Had one of those skull cap things on and â€“ 
[00:57:00]  Rosie O'Donnell, she's just desperate for constant attention.  Stop trying so hard to be interesting.  All right, here it is.  Please show it this time.  All right.  The perp's running.  He's sons of bitches.  All right.  How about that one?  How about this one?  All right.  Are they going to show it?  Oh, he almost got him.  He fell down.  He runs and â€“  Oh!  Oh!  Wow.  I didn't know they had a two-camera shoot for that one.  Oh, that's fantastic how he goes down.  And look at the cop. 
[00:57:30]  Look at that perp ain't even budging.  Oh, and they roll him over and handcuff him anyway.  Fantastic way to take out a perp.  But there were two cameras on this.  Yeah, they had a front one and a back one like that.  We'll get into the Rosie thing in a second there, Jimmy.  We teased the Chris Benoit thing.  This Benoit thing is getting just out of hand.  Well, who pretty much guessed what happened?  Huh?  Who guessed what happened?  We got â€“  Jimmy?  Yes.  Yeah, Jimmy did.  Yeah.  And we got info yesterday that turned out to be really accurate that was released later 
[00:58:00]  in the day.  Yeah.  We got the DA talking here.  It's twisted.  He had a very, very busy weekend.  Is it a real DA or is it an employee of the WWF from the FIC?  Because I can't â€“ I don't know what's real or fake anymore because Vince McMahon, as you  remember, about a month ago, not even a month ago, was blown up horribly in his limousine  and presumed dead.  It broke up our own Sam.  He was very upset. 
[00:58:30]  They brought in an investigator from the FIC, the Federal Investigation Center.  Center.  Yeah.  I keep wanting to say commission or something.  Center.  Because the FBI complained and said not to use their name in this bit.  And Vince was presumed dead.  They did a memorial for him and everything.  And then Chris Benoit apparently gets killed at this time.  They don't know how he did it at the time they were â€“ Vince came out. 
[00:59:00]  But Vince then is alive and comes out in the ring.  Well, it wrecked the whole storyline.  Wrecked the whole storyline.  You can't go with the Vince's dead storyline if one of your wrestlers really kills himself  after killing his whole family.  No.  Kind of takes away from the bigness.  And they did like a memorial to Chris Benoit on Monday because they didn't really know the  details yet.  So they spent three hours looking back at his career thinking just something went horribly  wrong in his house in Atlanta. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  Now the details are coming out and now the WWE is pretty much pulling out the hose.  Oh, that's it.  Spray it down.  Hose it off.  Hose it down and move on and make believe he never existed.  Sam, what have you noticed different on the WWE website?  Well, on Monday, they probably found out around 4 or 5 p.m. on Monday that he was dead.  And so the website was all Chris Benoit stuff.  You know, see old videos, pictures, all his best stuff. 
[01:00:00]  Buy his merchandise.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Usually when someone dies, the merchandise goes way up for a while.  Oh, yeah.  So why not take advantage of that a little bit?  Sure.  But then yesterday, once the news started coming out and the details started coming out,  everything was pulled off the website except for the news story.  Yeah.  So just the WWE press releases were there.  But other than that, there was no Chris Benoit stuff.  All his merchandise was pulled.  I was reading that at a bunch of toy stores, they were actually pulling Chris Benoit figures  off the shelves. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He was a bum.  They should distribute him.  He was, you know.  Yeah.  I guess they wanted to assume that perhaps carbon monoxide poisoning, anything.  It could have been anything.  But then when the details started coming out, he, oof.  They're leaning toward road rage, and that's got everyone.  Road rage.  Road rage.  What did I say?  Road rage.  Oh, my God.  Like his wife was walking down the hall too slow, and he beeped, and she wouldn't have  moved over.  He's got to get to the bathroom.  There's a backup.  I'm still thinking of the golf cart tee that pulled me over with other golf carts. 
[01:01:00]  I had the road rage yesterday.  But yes, road rage.  And now people are, like, up in arms about that, saying, ah.  But, I mean, look at the details.  What else could it be?  Is that a quote from someone?  Ah!  Ah!  Unquote.  Well, we got some audio from the press conference.  This is getting really twisted.  Do you find any illegal substances, any steroids, any drugs that are of concern, anything, any  illegal substance?  There were a lot of prescription medication that he had received from doctors with what 
[01:01:30]  we believe to be, at this time, legal prescriptions.  What type of prescriptions?  Um, that I'll have to get a full list, and maybe we'll be able to disclose later.  Right now, I'm not going to be able to give you that full list.  They got the prescription drug.  Yeah, they were anabolic steroids.  Well, there's, I was reading an article today that he felt like his kid was too small for  his age.  Yeah. 
[01:02:00]  And he was injecting growth hormones into his seven-year-old.  This story is getting sick.  Wow.  What an ass this guy was.  I didn't hear that.  And I used to call Chris Benoit the world's tallest dwarf.  He kind of had a dwarf-like look to him.  Dwarfy look.  Even though he, they're saying he was 5'10".  I don't think he was 5'10".  I think they upped his height.  And I guess they said his kid looked dwarf-like.  And this bothered Chris Benoit, according to this article I read this morning, and he  was injecting growth hormones into his seven-year-old to try to get him to, you know, to grow 
[01:02:30]  because he was undersized for his age.  That's screwy.  That's a good way to treat your son, because they found needle marks in the kid, by the  way.  That's how.  That's how.  The boy's body was in his bed, which is in an upstairs bedroom.  The female's body was found in what looked to me to be a family room that was also upstairs.  Chris's body was in the basement in a weight room.  How much time will last between the murder of the wife and son, approximately, do you know? 
[01:03:00]  From what we're gathering from the autopsy is my understanding that the wife died sometime  on Friday, that the son died probably Saturday morning, and that Chris Benoit died later on  Saturday.  Oh my God.  So he kills the wife first, and then the kid's still in the house?  Overnight.  How twisted is that?  Probably just closed the door and made sure the kid stayed out, and then... 
[01:03:30]  If you know anything about seven-year-olds, all they want to do is find their mommy, and  mommy's dead in the house, and he's still alive.  They did that Friday night.  He probably killed the kid Saturday morning, you know, before he realized.  He was calling all the...  Sending text messages to all the UFC guys Friday.  Yeah, yeah.  They were getting weird text messages from him.  Saying, what were the text...  He was explaining where his attack dogs were, because I guess he had attack dogs, and I  guess they knew this.  And then parts of his... 
[01:04:00]  Address.  Well, he gave out his address a lot.  My physical address is blank, blank, blank.  That was a text message.  The dogs are in the enclosed pool area.  Garage side door is open.  He knew he was going for it.  At that point.  Here's my physical address.  Here's my address.  Here's my physical address.  Over and over again in text messages.  He's, um...  He killed a wife.  I don't know why.  I'm probably in a fit of rage.  They had been divorced and bad.  You knew it was some kind of domestic...  She had a...  Like, she was going to leave. 
[01:04:30]  It was always one of those.  She had a restraining order back in 2003.  Of course.  And then three months later, she dropped all those charges that were pending or whatever.  She's a violent prick, this guy.  There was blood on her head.  There was a massive struggle, and he choked her out or strangled her.  And, um...  And then, uh...  Did he use the figure four, or was it a rear-knit joke?  I said that yesterday.  Probably.  Some kind of wrestling move.  Like a triangle?  And the sun, he probably, um...  They said he smothered the sun, which is...  It's like, you know, because that's more of like a shame thing. 
[01:05:00]  Like, uh...  Strangling is so vicious and angry, man.  That's like...  Smothering is like...  Where's Iraq getting his info from?  Uh, Iraq...  That was in the paper today, too.  Our hands and feet were tied up.  Yes.  Yeah, her...  And the sun was, uh...  Suffocated with a pillow.  Yep.  Yeah, that's all in the paper.  I want to be grabbed the kid while he was sleeping.  He might have just said...  Yeah, that's wake up, though.  The kid was probably asleep.  Of course he would.  He'll sleep through that.  But, I mean, the kid was probably sleeping.  He put the pillow over his face.  The kid was sleeping, they're saying, early Saturday morning. 
[01:05:30]  All right, well, here's more audio from the DA.  Cool.  I will say this additional information.  There was a Bible placed beside the body of each of the victims, and I thought that was  somewhat bizarre.  Were there any signs of struggle from the son or the wife?  No.  I will tell you that the wife was bound on her feet.  And I think also on her wrists, there was some blood under her head. 
[01:06:00]  As far as I know, those were the only signs of a struggle.  They were both close.  She was wrapped in a towel, I think, but wearing clothes underneath.  Man, he had a busy weekend.  Oof.  He had a busy weekend.  That is just...  So, he strangles the wife, ties her up, strangles her, then you got the kid being smaller, 
[01:06:30]  and then he hangs himself in the weight room, using the weights.  Yeah.  What do you think he's hanging himself?  You're familiar with weights that are attached to a pulley.  It was the cord on the weights.  Oh, my God.  How did he do that?  Because you wrapped that cord around your neck, and you put all the weight on it.  Probably just...  Yeah, he probably had to pull the pin out and put it down a little further, because his big,  heavy neck...  Yeah, that big, fat neck. 
[01:07:00]  And it's like, no, all the weights are going.  All right, let me put a little more weight.  He had to kneel, though, I'm sure, and let it just kill him.  Yeah, yeah.  Because you can't stand up.  It's not that tall.  So you can just kneel down.  Or he lifted it somehow and held it and then tied it around his neck and let it go.  Oh, let her rip.  Yeah, I'm guessing.  I just hit myself in the helmet doing that.  Ooh.  I don't know.  Do you notice why I've ever sought protection from him anyway, hearing domestic abuse?  I have not seen the documents. 
[01:07:30]  I'm told that perhaps in 2003, a temporary protective order was sought, and I believe in the superior court,  and later dismissed.  What's a TPO typically sought for?  I don't know.  Typically, they're sought for some form of domestic violence, but not always.  Not always.  Wow.  I hope we get to find out why he decided on that.  Nah, you never find out.  You don't think you'll find out?  He's dead.  Like three years from now, they'll do an A&E story.  You'll find out. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  A&E true Hollywood stories.  It could have just been an argument where, like, you know, we've all been mad enough to murder somebody,  and when you're, like, that strong, man, he might have been on that roid rage.  All of a sudden, you're choking your wife, and she's dead.  Then you're like, all right, now what?  She's dead.  He tied her up.  Why would he tie her up?  Maybe she said she was going to leave.  You can't, you know, if you, you know, roid rage, after a couple minutes, you'll calm down.  You're not going to tie her up and then, you know, scream at her and then choke her.  Maybe he was trying to make it look like a break-in.  Maybe he killed her, panicked, and said, all right, this could look like a break-in. 
[01:08:30]  I could say me and my somehow try to figure out a way to make it look like she was killed during a home burglary  and then realized I can't do it.  Then he looked at the TV and A&E's investigators was on, and he's like, you know, nah, I'll never get away with this.  Yeah, and then kill the son because this kid would have no mother.  And the father would be in jail forever.  And then, of course, to kill the son.  Well, didn't he have another wife from a, he has other kids and another wife who was married before. 
[01:09:00]  How lucky is she?  Yeah.  She's like.  Got away from that guy.  He knew a lot of the guys personally that died, too, in recent years.  So we went on TMZ.com.  They have a whole montage of wrestlers that have died just in the last, like, I don't know, up to 10 years.  Yeah.  It's an unbelievable montage.  You can't believe it.  Everyone from Bam Bam Bigelow to the Boss Man to Elizabeth, who used to hang out with, what, Randy Savage.  I didn't know that the Boss Man. 
[01:09:30]  Huh?  Elizabeth.  Elizabeth died of pills and alcohol.  I didn't know she'd, I remember her, and I don't even watch that stupid sport.  Well, I showed Ant, because Ant doesn't watch a lot of wrestling, but he knew just about every one of them, too.  The Big Boss Man was huge back in the day.  Right, right.  The Big Boss Man, he'd come out and kick some ass with his nightstick.  Here it is.  You got, yeah, Chris Benoit.  Owen Hart, of course, died during a match.  Eddie Guerrero.  Guerrero, I mean.  Ravishing Rick Roode is dead. 
[01:10:00]  Yokozuna.  Elizabeth is dead.  The Big Boss Man, Earthquake.  Dino Bravo.  Mr. Perfect.  Yeah, Mr. Perfect.  Bam Bam Bigelow.  The Junkyard Dog died in a car accident.  They have Andre on there, but he was not expected to live too long.  He was a massive human being.  One of the road warrior guys, Hawk.  Right.  And then finally, I never heard of the last one.  Sensational Sherry.  Sensational Sherry, also dead. 
[01:10:30]  It's on TMZ.com.  Dead Wrestlers.  Oh, man.  Junkyard Dog.  So, Vince McMahon had to change his tune, because on Monday, he was kind of praising Chris Benoit's career,  and they did a whole memorial to him, a whole three-hour special.  Right, Sam?  Yeah.  And then these details are coming out, and then Vince is like, whoa, we've got to distance ourselves from this guy.  Yep.  So, he went on TV last night and had this statement?  Yeah, this one was a pre-taped one.  It wasn't in the ring, but he put it on right before ECW came on last night.  This guy's an ass. 
[01:11:00]  You know, I hit the button at the exact same time, and I really thought Vince said that.  And I'm like, wow.  I love the Vince.  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  I'm somber.  Last night on Monday Night Raw, the WWE presented a special tribute show, recognizing the career of Chris Benoit.  However, now some 26 hours later, the facts of this horrific tragedy are now apparent.  Therefore, other than my comments, there will be no mention of Mr. Benoit's name tonight. 
[01:11:30]  On the contrary, tonight's show will be dedicated to everyone who has been affected by this terrible incident.  This evening marks the first step of the healing process.  Tonight, WWE performers will do what they do better than anyone else in the world.  Entertain you.  I thought he was going to say, tonight the WWE performers will do what they do better than anyone else in the world. 
[01:12:00]  Steroids.  Die.  That was a good way to handle it, though.  Come out and acknowledge it.  Like, all right, look, 26 hours.  I like that.  Yeah, Vince ain't afraid of coming out and laying it out there like that.  But, yeah, this guy killed his wife and his son.  We didn't now address it.  I like that, you know.  We could have taken away the tribute.  We look like asses.  You made me look like an ass.  Phil Mushnick's going to have a field day with us.  Oh, boy.  God, does Phil Mushnick.  Oh, the Mush hates Vince. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, but I bet.  Plays right into everything Mr. Mushnick says about Vince.  Well, I'll tell you one thing.  Steroids and blah, blah, blah.  Phil doesn't like Vince because Vince is an alpha male.  And Mushnick, you can't tell where his neck ends.  He's just a nothing writer who probably had bigger dreams.  And he's a curmudgeon.  He's beat up in school by people like Vince.  Of course.  He's a douche.  Yeah.  All right, who keeps calling on the hotline?  I think we sent Bon Jovi down to the iPhone.  All right, well, we're going to mess with the iPhone people next. 
[01:13:00]  And we've got Bob Kelly in the studio.  He's performing with us on Saturday at the Mohegan Sun.  Yes, the Mohegan Sun.  Saturday's the big day for Mohegan Sun.  The comedy tour hits Connecticut.  How many people is that?  It's a smaller venue.  I think we're going to do...  Got to be 10, 12 people.  Perhaps more than that, Ant.  I think we're going to do between 7,000 and 8,000.  That's a sellout.  That's small.  Well, Jones Beach.  Jones Beach is a lot bigger than that.  And these other venues are a lot bigger.  Yeah, it's one of the smaller shows.  5,500.  Oh, 5,500, Kenny said.  5,500?  Yeah. 
[01:13:30]  How he had that information at the ready mentally.  5,500.  So, yeah.  Definitely 5,500.  5,500.  5,507.  Definitely 5,500.  Take us through Ticketmaster.com.  What's the website again for us?  Virus Tour, right?  Yeah.  Virus Tour, one word, has all your details on MySpace.  But we're broadcasting live from The Wolf Den.  Keep listening to The Wolf for details on how you can join us for the Friday morning broadcast.  Okay?  Yes.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[01:14:00]  Update time.  Update.  Now, some of the stories we do on The Opie and Anthony Show, we like to do a little update.  It's update time.  Do we ever update anything?  Update Wednesday.  Oh.  We update stories all the time.  Sure.  Keeping you informed.  Yes.  Here's a story we've been working on. 
[01:14:30]  The only virus spreading across America.  Yeah.  I guess Mike North bad-mouthed us.  I think he's trying to get a little attention, to tell you the truth.  What is he doing, though?  Because no one really knows who he is outside of his local market, I guess.  But, you know, I think he wants to spread his wings and thinks he's going to do it by mentioning our name.  By the way, this isn't...  Sorry.  This isn't the update.  But now we've got two updates. 
[01:15:00]  Because we did talk to Mike North on our show.  And we had a good time with him.  Yeah.  Does a show in Chicago.  And I didn't even know this, but he tried out for Imus' slot here in New York.  Did he?  At the fan.  And MSNBC, I guess.  Maybe not the MSNBC portion.  Oh, no.  Because they're just moving on.  Never mind.  Yeah.  For the fan.  But everyone has tried out.  Yeah, everyone's trying out for that gig.  We have secretly tried out for that gig.  I tried out for it.  Yeah.  Pretty much everybody has tried out for the Imus gig. 
[01:15:30]  But I know nothing about sports, so I came off sounding really stupid.  Said something.  They brought up basketball, and I'm like, I don't know.  Kareem.  Kareem.  He was in a movie Airplane.  Right?  Yeah, but your Daryl Strawberry impression was terrific.  Well, I just did coke.  Yeah.  It was great.  It was a blast.  So this is what Mike had to say.  It was also my Doc Gooden impression.  Yeah.  Mike was on the local Fox affiliate in Chicago, had this to say about us.  And remember, we just talked to the guy, and we got along. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  Mike North is with us from the score up in Chicago.  I want to get to Ozzy with you in just a moment.  But on a personal note, I'm more interested.  Last time we had you on, a few days later, you go to WFAN and try out to replace Don Imus,  who had been fired.  And they still don't know what they're doing up there.  They don't know if they want to be a sports station at WFAN or have a political guy.  How did your tryout go for a couple days?  What's the word up there?  Well, they told me that, you know, it's very tough for a Chicago guy to make it in New York.  I said, you think?  I said, let me tell you something. 
[01:16:30]  Why don't you give me a...  You want to see how tough it is?  I'll go up there and knock them dead.  We got to eat Opie and Anthony up here.  Nobody even knows who they are.  They're on another station.  Nobody even cares.  I went up there and knocked them dead.  I'm on the short list.  That's what they told me.  So we'll see what happens.  All right, good luck, my man, with that.  Thanks, buddy.  You know what's weird about that?  When you say no one knows about Opie and Anthony, you know about Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Like, there are people in New York radio, I don't know.  Right.  You know what I mean?  I can't say no one knows who they are because I don't know them. 
[01:17:00]  I hate this crap.  As soon as you say no one knows Opie and Anthony, you know us enough, and there's enough of a buzz, so to speak, that you mentioned us.  Yeah.  Like, there are people doing morning radio right now in New York.  I don't know them.  I can't give you a name.  I don't know them.  That's the definition of not knowing someone.  You don't know them.  Yeah.  You can't make fun of people not knowing them.  But they're just saying, Opie and Anthony, no one knows them.  That's not true.  Yeah.  And the other guy didn't go who?  You know us enough that you had him mention us. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, the other guy didn't say who, right.  He knew.  Who?  What?  I don't like the fact.  Here's what bothers me about that whole clip.  Not even that he said the show.  The fact that he said knock him dead.  How old are you?  Knock him dead.  Knock him dead.  I go there and knock him dead.  Shut up.  That's what I do.  What are you going to give, 110%?  Could be another one of these two-faced radio guys.  I mean, right to our face, we had a good time with the guy.  We got along.  He knew a lot about us because he was talking about pretty much everything we've done in radio,  including the latest controversy we were in, the church thing we did. 
[01:18:00]  He knew our whole resume.  Yeah.  You had him in the studio?  No, on the phone.  He did a little sidocast while he was doing his show, you know, and it went well.  And then the first chance he gets, he's like saying how we're failures and no one knows  us.  No one knows us.  I would say you said you're a failure.  I don't think he said that.  I don't think I was saying you're a failure.  He said we have to eat Opie and Anthony.  Like, ugh, what is this all about?  Yep.  Eat me.  So.  Oh, whatever.  I mean, the latest trend in Chicago came out and we had another uptick. 
[01:18:30]  Yep.  Still nothing to brag about, but we're doing well.  But it's going up every time.  Going up every month for six straight months.  You best did.  We're going up.  So if you're listening on CKG, we greatly appreciate that.  And someone wrote on the instant feedback, I know this is local.  Relax.  We'll get to some Grand Rapids news soon.  They're like, this is all word of mouth, what's happening in Chicago with you guys, because  there's no advertising whatsoever.  One of the problems we have with the company, by the way, they just kind of threw us in here  and said, ha, make it happen. 
[01:19:00]  And that's what we do.  And we're trying.  But they said that there's Eric and Kathy billboards on every block in Chicago.  There should be for that horror show.  Oh, we haven't goofed on them in a while.  No one knows Eric and Kathy.  In Chicago, they're very big.  I mean, it's a guy in a hole.  It's nonsense.  And we can make it local for every city that we're being heard in.  It's that local morning show with a guy and a chick.  And they make believe they're kind of married to each other,  even though they have spouses outside the radio show.  And it's all that hacky crap. 
[01:19:30]  It's on stations like Kiss and I can't even name another one.  Maybe a station named after an animal.  You know, one of those.  And they do.  They talk to each other like they're a couple.  Yeah.  And they give the old, oh, now.  Oh.  They keep each other in check.  Yeah, they keep each other in check.  The guy will talk about something.  Hey, you know, I saw this lady last night.  What a beautiful young lady I saw.  Hey, hey, hey.  Now.  It's like, wait a minute. 
[01:20:00]  You're not my friggin' wife.  Shut up.  Shut up, you hole.  Talk about how I took her back to a hotel and ravaged her.  Right.  Oh, now.  Shut up.  And, of course, they have to have a sports guy, you know, named Tank or something.  Hey, it's Tank.  Let's get sports with the Tank.  Yeah.  I got sports scores.  I don't know if we're going to be able to make it through this.  I was at Hooters all night long.  Oh, that Tank.  You better calm down, Tank.  Two-dollar pinchers and 50-cent wings.  Oh, look at this, Warren. 
[01:20:30]  Tank.  Yeah, Tank.  You know, I got to go out with Tank one night.  Oh, you couldn't keep up.  Right.  Yes.  Keep emasculating me, hole.  Right.  That's your job is to emasculate the male host.  And Tank is wearing some kind of obscure college jersey.  Yeah, he's 45 years old.  He has a hat with a propeller on it.  He's acting like he's still in college.  Oh, I'm Tank.  Where's my donuts?  Yeah.  Everyone knows they eat donuts in the morning.  Tank.  Gotta take care of this beer belly of mine. 
[01:21:00]  And remember, 15 past the hour, Tank will be on every day, same time.  Same time, sports scores, you know, talking about how he was out all night doing his thing.  Tank.  Hanging out with the sports.  Oh, went out after the big game last night.  Got a little hungover.  Slept on the couch in the jock room.  Well, let me tell you about my night.  I finally got the kids to sleep and the girls came over and, oh, did we have a night?  Oh, what did you do?  Oh, well, Marge broke out the wine and we got a little tipsy, let me tell you. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, you wild bitch.  Wow.  What did it be great if they finally had a fun evening for real?  Like, what did you do?  Oh, we knitted an AIDS quilt and then we all put on strap-ons and ran around the neighborhood  screaming racial epidemics.  I don't know how you knit a quilt.  With Tank.  Chasing Tank. 
[01:22:00]  Chasing Tank.  With stupid beer belly Tank with the sports scores.  Yeah, the sports scores.  This whole life revolves around the local teams.  That's right.  I'm Tank.  Here's the sports.  Right.  Went to the high school basketball championship game last night because I'm Tank.  Ah, did you, Tank?  Meanwhile, Tank is kneeling in a rest area looking through a hole in the side of the door  getting tapioca on his cubby's hat.  Stupid Tank.  Oh, Tank. 
[01:22:30]  I don't even know what show has Tank.  Tank has his own Tank mobile.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, catch me on a tank out.  I'll be out in the tank and it's just some bad like SUV painted like a tank.  There's a kooky horn.  I'll be down at the sports bar located at blah, blah, blah.  Nothing but sports jerseys.  And probably in the middle of winter he's wearing the shorts to work.  Yeah.  With my college football jersey. 
[01:23:00]  Fat calves.  Tank has fat calves.  We're in Tevas to work in January.  This is crazy.  Yeah, but I'm Tank.  I'm out of control.  You sound like somebody, man.  Every freaking sports guy from every dumb morning show.  I'll come to you.  One of Tank's gigs, like there's eight people in front of him.  All right.  I want to know who was the first cub to hit for the cycle.  All right.  Ever.  Anyone?  You.  You. 
[01:23:30]  All right.  Is this a late crowd here?  It's a late crowd always, right?  But I'm Tank.  I'm Tank.  We promoted this all week.  Why do I have eight people in front of me?  I'm Tank.  Oh, God.  I already threw the t-shirts out.  I have nothing left.  I have nothing left to do in this bar.  How did you get a gig go?  Might as well get another picture of me here.  How'd the gig go last night, Tank?  Oh, it was great.  There were thousands of people there.  Sounds great, Tank. 
[01:24:00]  He still lives with his mom.  Does he get the broads, though?  I don't remember if the Tank gets the broads.  Tank gets fatties and sports groupie bitches.  But does he have outrageous stories about his conquest from the night before?  Oh, I'm sure.  But they're all lies.  They're all lies.  Tank suffers from premature ejaculation.  It happens as soon as you shake his hand.  Hi.  Oh, God, a woman.  I don't know what to do.  He tries to be funny. 
[01:24:30]  Looks like Tank misfired.  Oh, God, a woman.  I can tell you who the bulls are going to draft.  This time, I don't know what to do with a woman.  Oh, Tank.  I guess it's the ESPN Classic for me once again tonight.  Tank can only stay aroused if he's reading the goofus and gallant section of highlights.  Tank sucks.  Ew, is this true?  One of Eric and Kathy's bits.  And we don't even know if Tank works for Eric and Kathy. 
[01:25:00]  We know there's a Tank pretty much in every city in America.  But one of Eric and Kathy's bits that they actually do as the fake married couple on the air.  Top seven greatest love scenes women want men to reenact.  Oh, my.  Please tell me three of them are from Raging Bull.  Oh, please.  Can we get some of these information?  Oh, that's fantastic.  I got an answer.  Yeah.  What?  Something from The Accused.  The Accused. 
[01:25:30]  What?  What happened?  That's a sexy movie.  Oh, what happened?  No?  Wrong?  Oh, what?  Oh, what?  All right, what are the answers?  The date scene where he bites her face.  He's laughing at all the jokes.  She's been teasing him all night.  He just can't wait to bite her face.  I'd go for the Ted Bundy story.  Another romantic.  All right, what's the question, Hawk?  How is it set up? 
[01:26:00]  Top seven greatest love scenes women want men to reenact.  All right, start with number seven.  Of course, Tank would pick a sports movie.  Yeah.  Rudy.  Rudy.  Oh.  Rudy.  Desperado.  I know the real reason why he got a chance on that football field.  There was something going on in the coach's office.  Let's see.  The scene set in Mexico.  Antonio Banderas puts down his guitar just long enough to make sweet music with haughty Selma Hayek. 
[01:26:30]  He really turns up the Latino heat when he takes the spurs from his boots and lightly runs them across the small of Hayek's back.  Those filthy spurs that have been digging into horse flesh.  Stepping on horse crap.  Yeah, he's digging them into the side of her back and infecting it with little ticks and fleas and spurs.  Leaving green nuggets.  But most women don't look like Selma Hayek, a bunch of fat chicks, especially in Mexico. 
[01:27:00]  Of course not.  Their best love scene in Mexico was when he was yelling, I love you, as he was on the ball for three straight days.  With his little spurs, with his little trousers pulled down over his spurs.  And, you know, girls will put up with that if it's Antonio Banderas doing it with spurs.  If it's just, you know, Joe working slob.  Doing it with his lace from his Nike.  Yeah.  We got answers coming in.  Someone's asking if the gimp scene from Pulp Fiction is on this list.  That was nice. 
[01:27:30]  No, I'm sorry.  That was a sexy scene.  How about this boy's life?  Oh, that was Kevin from Connecticut.  Yeah.  This boy's life.  This boy's life.  This boy's life.  No swim fan.  We don't have to go through the scenes.  No, no.  Swim fan.  On your face or on your side?  On your face or on your...  Wait.  No, on your back or on your...  No.  No.  The hell is it?  Someone's suggesting the law.  Doggy.  Okay.  Hold on.  Now people are asking...  I don't think I got it here, do I?  Okay.  People are suggesting.  We got Max in Dallas.  Max.  Hey, boys.  Hey, Max.  Hey, buddy.  How about the scene from Traffic where Michael Douglas' daughter's getting it from the black 
[01:28:00]  drug dealer?  That's the one they want us to reenact?  I would say so.  I've talked about how in some bizarre way that's a really hot scene.  Fancy talk.  Fancy talk for a whore.  Yeah.  For a whore.  I hope it's not the scene from Happiness.  Oh, jeez.  I know a thing or two about a thing or two.  That's the greatest film ever.  Swim fan.  Fatal Attraction.  We can run through this.  Unfaithful. 
[01:28:30]  Basic Instinct.  Team America.  American History X.  Team America.  The puppet scene.  Shower.  And then, of course, Wild Things was the number one movie there.  To reenact?  Yeah.  Women want guys to reenact the scene in Wild Things?  Isn't that getting too broad?  It's a scene set in a dark, cheap motel room.  Nev Campbell and Denise Richards proceed to dump champagne on one another, engage in a little  three-way with Matt Dillon.  Yeah.  There were some very hot scenes in that movie.  Yeah, but I wouldn't think that would be one a woman would want her guy to reenact. 
[01:29:00]  All right?  Bring over a couple of your friends.  Right, right.  And I'll do that.  You could watch.  Well, it was Eric and Kathy getting a little outrageous.  Oh, that's a little crazy.  You know, when we swing, it's just great.  Do we have any audio of them doing that?  I wouldn't, yeah.  We should give people a taste of their awful voices.  Who gives a crap?  I got sports scores from last night to run through.  Sorry, Tank.  Everyone needs to know what the Padres did last night.  I never understood that when you get the sports guy on a morning show just... 
[01:29:30]  And the Reds beat just every sports score.  Oh, my God.  Let's say hi to Carl in Chicago.  Carl, what's up?  Oh, man.  It's good to hear you ask.  Mike North is just an ass.  Yeah, that comes across.  Yeah, he's kind of two-faced.  We expect that from most radio people, though.  Say one thing to your face, and then when you're not around, they do another thing.  There's a couple of billboards in Chicago, but, you know, the brothers really like you here in Chicago. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, thank you.  Thanks, Holm.  Oh, thanks, Carl.  We appreciate that.  That was not very urban, Anthony.  Well, I was trying to be a little, you know, relevant to the gentleman.  You were trying to be hip, and it didn't...  You were like, thanks, Holm.  I said, thanks, Holm.  Yo, thanks, Holm.  Hey, Carl, do you have a homie name?  Huh?  Do you have a homie name?  No, a lot of people call me Big Black.  Big Black?  That's your homie name.  Everyone has a homie name.  Are you a tall fellow?  Yeah, I'm 6'7". 
[01:30:30]  Oh, wow.  Are you really?  6'7".  You work out?  You a big guy?  Yeah.  How much do you weigh?  6'7", what?  3'20".  Wow.  Thank God, Carl.  Damn.  Big Black is on our side.  Thank you so much, Carl.  And I love white women.  Me too, Carl.  Oh, boy.  You can have mine.  Whether they like it or not.  His other nickname is the Shishkebobber.  Four white broads just hanging off.  Just built up an immunity to mace. 
[01:31:00]  Eat it like candy.  They spray mace.  Hike, hike, hike, hike, hike.  His nickname is Louisiana Black Snake.  Yeah, Carl.  Yeah, Carl.  We know what you got.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  Say hi to the brothers out there for us.  Yeah, spread the word for us, all right?  On the south side.  Jackie, what's up?  It's the baddest part of town.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, I just want to tell you guys.  I've seen a billboard of you in Chicago.  Really?  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's definitely been a billboard of you guys because I had no idea what you look  like. 
[01:31:30]  Right.  And there was a billboard on the way to the city.  And please, you guys are so much better than Eric and Kathy.  I've never listened to them, but that is the biggest, just the worst show in the morning  to listen to.  And you guys are completely mocking it perfectly.  Sweetheart, is it the billboard with the guys and with Steve Dahl?  Yeah, they did have a cool billboard.  We had a cool billboard up with Steve Dahl for about a week.  That was the, that's the problem with Jackie's, that's the problem with Jackie's phone call.  It says, you guys had a billboard.  Yeah. 
[01:32:00]  I guess someone didn't pay the bill, huh?  It was there.  Oh, gosh.  Oh, I never had a billboard.  Oh, Tank, you don't need one.  You're bigger than life.  Tank.  Stupid, Tank.  Let's go to Freddie in Chicago.  Freddie.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, Mike Norris is nothing but a punk, because he's a man-cow's bitch.  Him and man-cow are the best of friends.  I don't believe anything that comes out of Norris' mouth.  Oh, I didn't realize that.  Okay, that explains it.  That explains it. 
[01:32:30]  But he bad-mouthed man-cow, I believe, when he was on with us.  What the hell is up with this guy?  I don't know.  Wow, he's really trying to spread his eggs around in multiple baskets.  All right.  Man-cow isn't even on anymore, right?  No.  He has to rent a studio somewhere in Chicago, but he doesn't broadcast it.  He doesn't have to go to Chicago anymore, but he broadcasts to really small cities.  Small cities, and they're constantly changing.  Like, they'll throw him out of one, and it'll pick up some AM stations.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry.  He is hurt in Salisbury, Ocean City, Maryland. 
[01:33:00]  I'm sorry.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I said small cities.  Where?  And instead of Chicago, he's in Champaign, Illinois.  So I'm sorry about that.  Wow.  And Joplin, MS is what?  Missouri?  Missouri.  All right.  Joplin, Missouri.  That's a biggie.  Wow.  And Missoula, Montana.  I'm sorry.  And instead of LA, he's on in Stockton, California.  He's in places that outlaws went to in the 1800s.  That's the only place I know these names from. 
[01:33:30]  I think we can find them in Joplin.  Outlaws and negation.  Bad cow.  That's what it is.  Send the posse out to Joplin.  He's hurt in old mining towns.  Mining towns.  He's hurt in towns where the Brady Bunch got...  Where Mr. Howell put him in a cage.  Yeah, thank you.  Not one of those cities has a major league team.  They're all minor league team cities.  If they even have those.  They're...  Are you...  Like...  The Joplin Jaguars.  Actually, they're not the Joplin Jaguars. 
[01:34:00]  How dare you?  Oh, Tank.  Oh, now.  Well, I was just saying, Tank.  Now, I don't know.  You're the sports expert.  That's right.  Tank is.  He probably talks only in cool sports terms.  Like, if the White Sox beat the Orioles, he'll probably go,  Oh, yeah, the Chai Sox.  They clipped the bird's wings.  Yeah, clipped the bird's wings.  Oh.  That's all lingo.  Oh, they did, Tank.  That's his whole thing, is to see what team played what team,  and then, yeah, he kind of...  Come up with some lingo.  Come up with some cute things. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  To say that one team beat another team.  I noticed on the fan...  That's what you do on the radio.  They don't want to say over or beat too many times.  They'll say, they topped the Red Wings.  They bested the thing.  You listen.  They keep switching it every score if they're giving 10 scores,  so it doesn't have any done to.  Ah, Tank rules.  The Cubs balled.  The Tigers.  Did they?  The Cubbies.  Yes.  Yeah.  The Cubbies.  I know.  I know.  I would like to hear a little of them.  I know we have in the past. 
[01:35:00]  What, Eric and Kathy?  Get us an Eric and Kathy.  Get us a little Eric and Kathy.  It's been a while.  It's going to be hilarious,  because you know they're going to sound exactly like what you guys have been doing.  Of course.  20 minutes.  No, they're pretty edgy, actually.  Kathy.  They really are.  They're very edgy?  Yeah.  I heard once, you know, it's like,  Oh, Eric, come here.  Let me f*** your c***.  All right, Kathy.  They were the show that we put the beeps in to make it look like they were shock jocks.  Like they were shock jocks.  It was pretty funny, actually.  I remember those.  Yeah.  It was funny.  We did them, uh, we did them good. 
[01:35:30]  My c*** stinks.  It certainly does, Kathy.  Here comes Tank.  Tank!  Tank, could you c*** me in my c***?  Sure.  Last time I did, my c*** smelt like c***.  You figured it out yourself.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll, uh, take a break.  Colin Quinn's here. 
[01:36:00]  Bob Kelly is here.  Bob Kelly is, uh, doing the Mohegan Sun with us.  Eight or nine comedians this Saturday.  Uh, brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  Mm-hmm.  Looking forward to going to the Mohegan Sun.  The show's Saturday.  Broadcasting live Friday.  It's a whole thing.  The whole weekend we'll be out there.  Partying and hanging out with our pets.  Playing some three-card poker.  Yeah.  Yep.  Colin's at Caroline's tonight.  What's today?  Tomorrow through Saturday, I think.  Oh.  Oh, very cool.  This week he's at Caroline's.  All right.  Colin Quinn will be joining the program next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Okay.  Hey, hey, hey. 
[01:36:30]  We're live.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Lots going on today.  We got Bob Kelly, who's now on the couch.  Yeah.  He's at your face.  We moved him over Carson style.  Yeah, for a huge superstar.  That's right.  Colin Quinn.  Colin.  Who's playing Caroline's this weekend?  He's a sarcastic Bob.  Yeah, it was until I said superstar.  Yeah.  I got a straight shot at Opie now.  This is what I like.  All right.  Very good.  2-1-2.  Caroline's number is 2-1-2.  2-1-2.  2-1-2.  2-1-2.  2-1-2.  2-1-2.  2-1-2.  2-1-2.  2-1-2.  2-1-2.  2-1-2.  2-1-2.  2-1-2.  2-1-2.  Will you be there through Sunday or just through Sunday?  Yes, I'm doing a portrait right now called Tibetan Lesbian on Couch. 
[01:37:00]  He made fun of you again.  Sit down.  He got slammed before the show even started, before the show came back from break, because  Colin was coming in, and we told Bob, look, you're going to have to go to the couch, because  Colin's coming up to the mic.  It's like Carson, you know.  Well, Kenny said that.  The new guy comes in.  So then he had to move to the couch.  So then Bob tried to get you, Colin.  He sits down on the couch and goes, why don't you put Fatso on the couch? 
[01:37:30]  And without missing a beat, Jimmy goes, we just did.  Let's be honest, guys.  That's hysterical.  Let's be honest.  Colin put on a few pounds.  Did you, Colin?  I put on a few.  Yeah, of course I did, but I'm a person that got fat.  I'm not a person that is fat.  Bob should be like, you're throwing a spear at a whale.  Manitoba.  You look like my Aunt Peggy, Fatso.  You look like a middle-aged housewife. 
[01:38:00]  Colin looks the same as he did when I saw him last.  I've been whipping huskies on a sled right now.  Look at the size of his head.  Look at your head.  At least I have my hair left.  You look like a...  I'd rather have...  You look like the fat mosque in Iraq.  The Sunni insurgent is going to blow up the mosque.  You look like the Queen of England.  You know what I love about this?  Colin has your number.  He has your number.  Colin has everybody.  He has a lot built up. 
[01:38:30]  Let me tell you.  He has a lot built up.  I will say that Bob can be pretty brutal.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, yeah.  We've seen it.  Not necessarily amusing, but brutal.  Just brutal.  No, yeah.  Bob's the guy that goes too far.  Like, you're a no-filter guy on here.  He's the greatest.  He's the greatest Bollywood uncle in the Bollywood musical.  He would.  Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Will Bob be appearing anywhere at Mohegan Sun besides in front of the buffet?  That's how cool.  You know what?  Fuck the O.B. 
[01:39:00]  Don't fuck the South of the U.S.  Hey, you're going to do the coast.  Hey, hey.  Sorry.  Hey.  We're about 45 minutes from that, my friend.  Oh, you can't do that now?  No, we can't do that.  I thought we were on XM.  And now you wreck Stephen S.'s great line because he cursed at the end.  Uh-huh, Stephen S., I wrecked your line.  Do you curse when you're selling rugs to tourists in Istanbul?  No.  So don't do it here.  And Quinn's not like Voss where he's going to throw a stinker.  Yeah.  He's just going to have nine of them. 
[01:39:30]  He sounds like them.  He mumbles like them.  At Mohegan Sun, don't get upset when you walk by and hear people go,  Tatonka.  Tatonka.  Why is everybody beating up on Bob?  Yeah, Lee Mahoney.  Why do you think?  Jimmy.  Jimmy, you're enjoying it more than anyone.  You're the worst.  Yeah, but that's Jimmy's pause because he's got a good one coming.  I don't like it.  Also, from someone's cell phone, Man Cow, the official radio show of the Lewis and Clark  Trail.  That's very, very good. 
[01:40:00]  He's in all these cities that are just like they were hot spots in 1850.  Deadwood.  Yeah, he's in Deadwood.  When the gold rush was happening.  It's great.  Yeah, I'll be up in the Pacific Northwest trying to find a new route.  Hey, let's say hi to Jeff in Jersey.  Jeff, what's going on?  Hey, boys.  How are you doing?  Good.  All right, Bob.  I used to go to order for breakfast on Wednesday at Newark Airport.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Thank you, buddy.  How are you doing, man?  Good, buddy. 
[01:40:30]  Did your credit card company call up and think it was stolen?  I actually was having, I was having a really nice breakfast.  Yeah.  I was having, tell them what I was having.  Here's the deal.  We only got 45 minutes left on this side of the show.  Right.  I got this huge breakfast plate and it cost me $7 with the tax and the tip and the coffee  and the juice and the whole thing.  So I went to the guy at front.  I said, I want to buy this guy breakfast.  So I take out a $10 bill of figure and then I should cover it. 
[01:41:00]  It was like $18.  That's the guy's breakfast.  Was it $18?  I ordered fruit, cottage cheese.  I ordered like a couple eggs over here.  I ordered like a special type of dietary meal.  That's a dietary meal.  It was taking up the whole hour over there.  Yeah.  Thanks for the nice gesture.  I hope I see you at the airport again.  I'm going to throw eggs at your face.  Another instant feedback from Gutshot Drew.  The morning hole has dirty, we were talking about Eric and Kathy up there in Chicago, just 
[01:41:30]  wrapping that talk up.  The morning hole has dirty, dirty thoughts about pseudo overaggressive tank while she's  bedding her hen-pecked, whipped husband.  Yep.  The fake husband.  Colin, you've done those radio shows, right?  Yeah.  I've done them all.  The guy and the girl, they act like they're a couple for some reason.  Six seats in the show.  Yeah.  I thought they were a couple.  I don't even think I was invited on Eric and Kathy.  Yeah.  They act like they're married and a couple and then the guy will say something.  I find that when me and the other soccer moms are driving our minivans, 
[01:42:00]  we like to have something we can identify with.  You like listening to that and go, oh, this is good.  The little fights.  And it teaches you how to get along and suffer silently through your awful marriage.  You know what I mean?  And you don't drive the minivans into the side of the school or anything.  The guy talks about mowing the lawn and she goes, oh, and you always do it wrong.  Well, hon, why don't you get out there and give it a try?  You, oh, gosh.  Right now, I feel it.  Just waiting for one of those shows to snap.  That would be the best. 
[01:42:30]  I feel like I'm in the basement with my five uncles when they used to make me just sit there  and get them beers and open them.  All right.  What else would they make you do?  Yeah.  Bob's having a mood swing.  I'll tell you why, too.  If you want an analysis of Bob, it's not beat up on Bob Day.  Yeah.  It's just Bob's dream is, which I figured out, is to be like a guy, like a Budweiser commercial.  They have a bunch of friends and they sit around and have a few laughs on the weekend.  He wants to live that Eric and Kathy life.  Really?  Yep.  But he's so twisted.  But he, yeah, he doesn't realize like after six years, high neighbor and his neighbor is 
[01:43:00]  a normal one who's going to accidentally run over like a seed feeder or something.  And then they see the guys get like pruning shears in his eye because Bob turns on him.  You don't think Bob could make a good neighbor?  Yeah.  He'll pull it off for a while, but then, yeah.  Hey, how you doing?  Like talking over the hedge to his neighbor.  Right.  And then after a little while, like one thing goes a little wrong.  Yeah.  And Bob just loses his mind.  Yeah, because Bob realizes he's not his.  Breaks into the house and kills his family. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, he'd love like all of us, like all of us to be over at each other's house laughing  watching what's that?  Hey, I hope the ladies let us get away with this.  What's wrong with having friends?  Oh, I hope the wives don't hear us down here.  That'll ruin the fun.  What's wrong with it is you want to live the American dream and you're not fit for it.  That's all.  On two levels.  You actually look like you lost weight.  I'm not teasing you.  You think I'm really going into that softball? 
[01:44:00]  I may be taking and pounding, Norton, but I'm not that stupid.  That's right.  You kind of look like a little...  Norton, don't you insult me.  How fat is he?  I'm not even kidding.  You look like you lost...  I'm not even...  Shut up, you lying body stocking built.  Oh, no.  You really do look like an unfinished clone.  I was just trying to be helpful.  Oh, man.  That's how it goes.  That's how it goes.  Larva.  So shut up.  Norton reminds me of a larva, and I don't even know what that looks like. 
[01:44:30]  It's just a name.  It should be James Larva Norton.  He looks like he should be eating his way out of an apple.  God damn.  Oh, you are hurtful.  I'm just sitting there being hurtful.  I can't just give his friend a compliment.  I know.  You're trying to help him and support him.  You want to pick him up out of the dumps?  That's exactly what he would do to that neighbor, too.  I have no doubt that he's iconic, this one.  Oh, yeah.  When it comes right down to it, Bob Kelly will get some things done. 
[01:45:00]  His neighbor would look over the hedge, and Bob's walking away, and then he sees below  Bob's head, Bob's nude and covered in blood.  Hey, Tim.  That's funny.  Just that awful ass and his stupid feet pointing out to him.  Balanced out the rest of that.  Bob nude looks like a fat Vanessa Manila.  All right.  Are we ready for the update, finally? 
[01:45:30]  Oh, the update.  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  Remember the girl at Six Flags?  Yeah, the one that lost her feet.  Yeah.  That update.  You hear this story?  No.  Haven't read a newspaper, huh?  Well, you know, but not on the road.  I look at the local paper.  What's the bad neighborhood?  Where do the gays hang out?  I really hit him in the show that night.  Hey, this guy's from Sperling Town, ladies and gentlemen.  You know where to go after the show. 
[01:46:00]  That's true.  Colin's not above puffing a cigar through a hole.  Colin coined at Caroline's all weekend long starting tomorrow night.  Yeah, this girl's feet got cut off.  It was a great...  Six Flags and Kentuckians was on a ride, and both of her feet got ripped off.  It was a rock and lended two of yours, Caterpillar.  Not that many to spare.  Yeah, you should just grow back. 
[01:46:30]  I guess we'd love to know how to get ripped off.  All right.  All right.  She was on this Superman ride where they sit in this circular thing, and their feet dangle over the edge,  and it gets lifted up to about 250 feet, and then kind of free falls until you're about 20 feet from the ground,  and then, you know, the brakes come on.  Right.  And they hoisted them up to 250 feet, and this cable kind of snapped and actually wrapped around her feet.  Oh, my God.  And ripped her feet off.  Both feet. 
[01:47:00]  She lived?  Yeah.  And both feet just kind of tumbled 250 feet to the ground, which I always think is the reason, like,  they could reattach it until it hits the ground, and then you've got two broken feet.  Why do I feel like if you weren't doing this, you'd be one of those carnival ride operators, Anthony?  Yeah, I could be.  You got that look about you.  I got that, you know.  Come on.  You're from Patchogue, right now.  Give the cute girls the free ride.  That is, like, 14-year-old girls.  Hey, you're cute, girls.  Go out later. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, I love it.  That's wrong with a few statutory rape charges in various cities that this roving carnival goes to.  They'll never catch me.  I told you, Opie, Anthony's brother beat up my cousin one time there for a few years ago.  Really?  Years ago.  In Patchogue or in Rokongma.  Wait, Joe did?  Somewhere.  Yeah, I think.  One of these hillbilly towns.  One of those from Iceland or somewhere.  He gave my cousin a nice thumping.  A little sound thrashing.  For what reason?  I think he was being a dick.  He might, well, of course.  That's your family's side table. 
[01:48:00]  It was the Irish against the Italian.  It had to go down.  Really?  Yeah.  I never heard that one.  Yeah, there was something going on there, and Joe had to pummel him.  That's all right.  Later, my mother decided she had to move us to a cheaper place, so we moved to Central Islip,  which I just, yeah.  Then I got my ass kicked.  Yeah.  Constantly.  Give me 50 cent.  That's what I heard every day.  Give me 50 cent.  I'm like, okay, please don't. 
[01:48:30]  You give it to him?  I have to.  No, you don't.  You stand up for yourself.  It's prison.  You're saying no.  I was in elementary prison.  That's what I was in.  I was in elementary prison.  CIA is hardcore.  Oh.  You have to give him the money.  Jeez.  You've got to give him the 50 cents.  You can't just give him sexual favors like you.  I have a better idea than 50 cents.  I wouldn't have minded that if baby body wasn't nervously shifting his feet while he said it.  I hadn't on my leg.  Shut up, tall baby body.  His knee is still healing.  Good.  That's right. 
[01:49:00]  As soon as it heals, I want to smash it with a stick.  As soon as it heals, he's scheduled to be slaughtered by a Cambodian village ritually.  That's right, Brando.  You heard him.  I heard him.  He really has got some good ones.  I wish you didn't tell him I was going to be in.  He's up all night writing.  Are you an assassin, Willard?  All right.  Well, we've got the update on the feet girl.  Yeah, let's hear about her.  Feet girl update. 
[01:49:30]  The girl whose feet were severed while riding on this Six Flags ride in Kentucky is now in stable condition.  In wobbly condition.  Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where 13-year-old Caitlin Lasseter is being treated,  hospital management said the parents of Caitlin Lasseter would like to acknowledge everyone across the country  that have been supporting their daughter with many positive thoughts and prayers over the last six days.  Do they reattach their feet or not?  They haven't said, and they won't say.  They said...  How are you going to reattach their feet? 
[01:50:00]  I don't know.  They gathered them up and took them to the hospital.  Procedure?  I don't know.  Some type of microsurgery?  I think...  Imagine with a needle and thread.  With a glue and a hot gun.  Hot glue gun.  Just gray dead feet.  Oh, they're going to look awful.  Were they putting them on a little crooked?  Pointing left?  Yeah, they put them...  I would have put them on backwards just to be silly.  Don't make money off it. 
[01:50:30]  What did you say?  It also added that Caitlin's parents would like to state for the record that despite claims  in the media by representatives from Kentucky Kingdom Theme Park, at no time has any representative  of the theme park been in touch with members of the family.  That prompted Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom to release this statement.  Representatives from Kentucky Kingdom traveled to the hospital immediately following the  accident and were there for some time before the family requested that they leave.  We are deeply saddened by this incident and, of course, have genuine concern for the well-being 
[01:51:00]  of the entire family.  Yeah, that means the lawyer was like, get him out of here.  Exactly.  Get him out of here.  You're going to mess up the case.  Don't screw up the case.  We got a good one here.  Oh, yeah.  I'd lose a couple feet for that type of money.  Would you?  A couple pounds.  Thanks, Ed.  Deserved more than a cozy.  I was thinking very good.  I'm not saying it was a prior bit, but it was a short little.  It's just on timing alone.  That wasn't me laughing.  It was his feet.  It just wasn't good enough for that setup. 
[01:51:30]  That was the problem.  Yeah.  Yeah, dear Bob.  He's already almost crushed his knees with that damn thing.  Now his feet are going to go in.  It's like an avalanche onto a tent when he walks.  I can't just be bash Bob Day.  You're right.  Yeah, let's drop that.  Bob and he turned on me.  I had to do something, Jim.  Bob looks hurt.  No, I'm good.  Are you hurt?  I'm liking it.  I think Jim was actually complimenting you when he said, I think you lost some weight.  I actually thought he did lose a few pounds.  How would you think Colin lost a few or gained a few? 
[01:52:00]  Colin's the same.  Colin looks the same as he did last time I saw.  An elephant?  No.  He doesn't look any heavy.  He doesn't even have a receding hairline.  His head just got so fat.  Oh, my God.  That's pretty hurtful.  Wow.  There's no need.  That's uncorporal.  Really?  From the Iranian Kevin James, it really hurts.  All right, fat Keitha Sutherland.  Oh, you want to go for the oldies?  All right.  All right, Margaret Cho. 
[01:52:30]  And the worst thing is we can't even see each other's faces.  I know.  We're not even looking at each other.  We're so used to talking on the phone doing the same thing.  It doesn't matter.  You're used to this.  I tell you, if I let you listen to his voicemail message, I could actually have him brought  up on charges.  All right.  We're going to break.  We can regroup here.  Colin Quinn.  Caroline's.  Yeah.  Tomorrow's next Sunday. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  It's my final performance, Caroline's.  I'm retiring after this one.  No.  Oh, yeah.  Doubt that.  No.  Why?  Why?  I got a lot of good things happening.  A lot of good big things.  Yeah.  Up for a writing job on Flight of the Conchords.  Jimmy Kett will speak to somebody for him.  He loves that show.  Submitting sketch ideas.  It's funny, man.  I love that show.  They both look straight ahead.  That's ironic.  They don't look at each other.  That's crazy.  That's ironic.  Yeah, it really is.  I mean, just two guys that communicate so naturally.  Awkward's always funny. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  All right.  We'll continue on this fine.  Whip him out Wednesday.  Woo-hoo.  Oh, by the way, it's also Butt Rub Wednesday, and we forgot to mention that it's also Cat  Noise Wednesday.  What?  What happens when Jimmy's butt rub Wednesday?  Where did Jimmy come from?  Hold on.  Of course, I've piped him up.  I rub butts with Eric.  What?  Bear butts.  Bob, you want to do a butt rub with somebody?  No.  I did it.  My hair will get tangled in his hair.  I don't have hair.  He doesn't have hair.  No, it's with Jimmy.  Jimmy's the star of Butt Rub Wednesday.  I don't like Jimmy's bum, because it's always red in... 
[01:54:00]  Like a baboon.  Yeah, it's always got a red circle near the...  No, it doesn't.  Well, because it's recently been swatted, probably.  It looks like veal, like uncooked veal.  Jimmy can't just hang a normal moon.  No.  He's got to grab his hands and just pull like it's taffy, like it's a taffy pull.  Speaking of which, we went to... 
[01:54:30]  I forgot their names already.  Eastside Dave and Casey's Wedding.  Yeah.  The Ron and Fez Show.  And they had the camera on the table.  Oh, my God.  And you got so excited when I showed you the camera, you know.  You know, they leave the camera on all the tables so people could take pictures of each  other and then they collect them up and they have wedding pictures of their guests.  Yeah.  So Jimmy saw the camera, got so excited, ran in the bathroom with Keith the Cop.  What happened?  Me and Keith the Cop ran in and there's three great shots.  Two taken by me on the downward angle of...  It's great.  You can see, like you say, liquid. 
[01:55:00]  It's really...  Yeah.  Things are happening.  And one Keith got of me.  I pulled down my pants and I bent over and just took both hands and went, yank!  I got an open yawn shot.  Colonoscopy.  Oh, it's great.  Yeah.  It looked like you were singing opera.  Really?  What?  Oh!  Yeah.  I'm good for wanting that.  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me.  I don't have to work anymore.  You only expect one from me a day.  All right. 
[01:55:30]  Colin Quinn, Caroline's Bob Kelly doing our thing Saturday and we'll continue with Cat  Noise Wednesday.  I think Colin should see like a little butt rub though.  It kind of bothers me.  I really want a butt rub to happen with Colin Quinn.  No.  No.  He's still on.  Every time we're about to go off, then we go back.  I know.  It's so frustrating.  He's like hanging out with Mickey Mantle in the old days.  Is this done?  Can I get a beer?  Where's my donut?  Shut up.  That's it. 
[01:56:00]  He wants to eat.  Don't get greedy.  You're doing good.  Thanks.  You're right.  Jimmy, you're going to be blessed.  Jimmy's willing to do one more butt rub for everybody.  What is a butt rub?  Just do it, Bob.  I can do it.  Just get up and pull your pants down.  What if you see E-Rock do it again to prove that we're doing the butt rub?  E-Rock butt rub.  Come on.  It's for Colin.  Come on.  It's for Colin.  Can I just do it?  It's for Colin.  You did it earlier.  No cameras.  Just do it real fast.  Just stare at Colin.  You already got it on camera.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Big star.  Just do it, E-Rock.  Come on, E-Rock.  I'm Colin.  I'm Colin.  Stare in the face of our lovely young intern. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  And just don't think about another man.  Think about a woman.  She might have to leave.  She's gorgeous.  Why?  She's canastic.  Why?  Are you cool with this?  All right.  Obi.  No, she's cool.  No, I mean.  Good.  No, she's all right, man.  Trust me.  The crap we have to deal with behind the scenes.  Come on, E-Rock.  Get that butt rub.  Butt rub Wednesday.  This is all it is, Bob.  There's Jimmy's butt is out.  E-Rock's is out.  And then.  That has to.  No, you didn't rub.  You didn't rub.  You didn't rub.  You didn't rub.  You didn't rub.  It's not.  E-Rock, you saw. 
[01:57:00]  You never rub.  It's not butt touch.  You guys got to be a butt.  Lift your shirt up.  Oh, God.  They rubbed butts.  I thought it was lovely.  Not only did we rub them.  That was a charming moment.  Not only did we rub them, but I felt both cheeks pressed together and both separated slightly  and then we stopped.  It was very uncomfortable.  You opened your bum with another man's bum.  I wouldn't say open, but both just went like a little yawn.  So what do you think, Bob?  That's all it is.  It's butt rub Wednesday. 
[01:57:30]  It's the most uncomfortable thing I've ever seen.  It's awful.  I was kissed on the neck by a priest.  Huh?  He goes, it's the most uncomfortable thing I've ever seen.  I was kissed on the neck by a priest.  Bob got, Bob telling that story.  It actually got good.  All right.  After the break.  Good tease.  Good tease.  Colin knows how to do radio.  Yeah.  Now everyone's going to sit.  Hey, this is Eric and Kathy.  See you in the master break.  Oh, what a year.  It's Opie and Anthony with the whole part of the gang today. 
[01:58:00]  Could you move these motorbikes?  I'd like to park my Saturn.  It's the return of the official Opie and Anthony Wow Motorcycle Run.  July 11th from New York City to Philadelphia.  Join Keith the Cop as he leads a spirited pack of motorcycle enthusiasts from New York to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  The city of brotherly love.  Interested riders, boys and girls.  Email Keith at foundrymusic.com and join the Wow Motorcycle Run. 
[01:58:30]  It's the return of the Wow Motorcycle Run, July 11th from New York City to Philadelphia, only on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Another busy day on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Colin Quinn in studio playing Carolines this weekend here in New York City.  We got Bob Kelly in studio.  And I don't know where to begin.  Do we go with bitter Colin Quinn?  Or do we go with the story that you teased about Bob Kelly? 
[01:59:00]  It's up to Bob.  Bob, I like that story, but if you don't want to tell it, I understand.  Well, but bitter Colin Quinn is pretty good.  Well, bitterness just kind of permeates.  I mean, they have no particular story.  I was just trying to remark that I can't wait to see Evan Almighty this weekend.  I really think they'll hit it out of the park this time.  Thank God I'm out of the loop comedically because, I don't know, I can't make some of the messages that have been coming out.  You don't understand why that movie is so popular as far as the TV commercials are going on.  Are you kidding me?  There's a lot of little knee slappers going on here. 
[01:59:30]  It would take more than a movie bombing for me to be happy at this point.  A lot of people would have to die in a horrible...  How about if at the premiere of Evan Almighty there was a fire at all entrances?  Yes, that would be good.  And they were blocked.  Doors were blocked, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  People...  No, they all get out safely.  Getting out safely.  And that would be ironic because he plays Noah in the movie.  And if you've seen the preview, you've seen the whole movie.  They decided not to leave anything to the imagination for some reason.  Well, with a movie like that. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, good point.  Corral makes me laugh every time.  It makes me laugh on Movies on Demand when they go,  actually, it wouldn't be the first time Hugh Grant, he slept with a clown.  Wouldn't be the first time there was a clown in my bed.  I want to see that one, but I want to wait until the kids are in bed because it's so edgy.  Hugh Grant, just probably the best actor of our time.  You know what?  It's not even just Hugh Grant because Hugh Grant, I guess, you know,  we like the fact that he got caught with a hooker, but just what he represents,  which is that whole Notting Hill horror, you know, this wacky best friend movie 
[02:00:30]  and then the girl and then at the end it was played that, you know,  so glad we made, give me some love in, and everybody runs around in a circle  and I'm trying to kill myself.  I really am going to go on a rampage very shortly.  I cannot sit through, have not sat through one of his movies.  They are so boring.  Just the bore fest of him with that accent and his dry delivery on everything.  I like him when he's throwing like a canned ham at a paparazzi. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, you got along for that.  The real Hugh Grant, much better than the one in the movies.  And Bob, do you have a story for us?  That was obviously hot beans he threw at him.  Oh, whatever.  And a ham.  What happened to Bob Kelly fat belly cam?  Oh, what did you do?  What did you see that?  I got fat belly cam today.  What's wrong for everybody on Peloton?  Bob Kelly fat belly cam.  Fat belly cam.  You should ask me.  All right.  I'm not your pet.  It's fat belly cam Wednesday.  I'm not your pet, redhead.  Come on. 
[02:01:30]  Play along.  Yeah.  Nice.  I don't like that he actually keeps turning it back.  That's what's creepy.  It just keeps coming back.  It's like you're loving fat belly cam on Peloton.  I feel like I'm in like a sci-fi movie.  I keep turning it.  Does it really require a special camera to catch his belly?  I would say.  I would.  I would just a nice long aerial shot of the room.  I would love to take my shirt off and compare torso.  I know you would, Vanessa Manolo.  See those nice brown nipples of yours. 
[02:02:00]  You have blotchy fat tits.  I would love to show everybody on Peloton.  They're just red and white and back to red.  My tits are like Kirsten Dunst.  Your tits look like.  You can't say that.  Oh, sorry.  Why don't you just let them dump out to the last 10 minutes of the show?  I mean, hilarious stuff.  They're dumping out.  You're dumping out.  Your pecs.  Can I say pecs?  Yes.  Your pecs look like.  Say pectorals.  They just look like they ran a marathon.  Why are you manipulating? 
[02:02:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait.  That goes Holiday.  He's on the track.  He's at the wall.  She's gone.  The milkman delivered.  No.  What are they saying?  That's a great one.  I love that one.  That's our new one.  I love that one.  I still like the hockey one the best.  Halfway rebound.  Good.  No.  No.  Oh, my.  I'd tell you something.  How did that not go in?  That would be great.  I like this one.  Back goes Grippy looking up. 
[02:03:00]  And it's out of here.  Or is it?  No, it's off the wall.  My mistake.  Oops.  Not quite.  Almost.  I'll tell you the worst part of that awful joke was my polite.  I disgusted it myself when I did that.  All right.  So what was it to tell us is you're always clearing some muci out of your throat.  We can't tell if you're reacting or surviving.  It's because you underhook your nozzles from the mothership.  What?  All right.  What are you getting in?  Nozzles.  Sometimes.  Ah, go. 
[02:03:30]  Does anybody remember laughing?  Goodness gracious.  I'm going home.  I've made an ass of my show.  All right with the buttons.  I'm sorry.  I did that.  I'll tell you.  All right with the buttons.  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  Voice must fear the show.  Are those kind of funny burns?  Every third one of voices dies like that.  What was that?  That was a woman falling off stage.  She staged.  She staged.  Yeah, she went to stage dive and no one was there to catch her. 
[02:04:00]  And I swear.  And this is the sound.  I want to hear the story.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You got to hear with the music, though.  She's rocking.  The music's so bad.  At the end of the song to jump off the stage.  Listen to this.  She's hot, though.  The music is awful.  It's worth waiting for. 
[02:04:30]  The most horrifying part is that music sounds like Hilary Duff being raped by Akon.  Oops.  Excuse me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hilary Duff being seduced by Akon is what I meant.  Wow.  That's even worse in some way, isn't it?  It's more offensive.  We apologize for bitter calling.  I take it back.  Hey, what about this story?  Are we going with the story or no? 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, I want to hear it.  I don't know if you should tell the story now in light of the new climate.  That's all I was worried about, the new climate.  Bob is just manipulating himself.  You know what I'm saying, Robert?  Your hand.  I'm just watching you on Bob Kelly Fat Belly Cam.  That's kind of creepy that you're doing that.  And you're like, your hand is in your lap, and your thumb and the rest of your fingers are making this grip, grip, grip movement.  I don't understand what you're doing in that seat. 
[02:05:30]  They're mine.  He's like, I want you to mind your business.  He's like, how's that sound?  That pal talk cam isn't for you.  It's for the losers in cubes right now that need something to do, and they want to look at my fat stomach, so I'm giving it a little extra right here.  Oh, my God.  A little zoom in.  It's like watching the stars of the show.  One of the stars of the show.  One of the stars of the show.  Hong Kong casino manager.  Hey, what?  What?  Mr. Bob.  They're hitting on 16.  I think they're card counting.  I'm all for card counting.  You are?  Who is that?  Yeah, of course.  How can they make that illegal?  It's legal.  It is.  I want to know the story.  I don't know if we should, honestly, you should wait to the break in light of police culture. 
[02:06:00]  Well, it'll be gone by then.  There's no more.  Yeah, is it a good story, Bob?  Did you start slowly?  What about the 10 o'clock?  It wasn't even, I mean, Colin has a better story than me, for God's sake.  What is yours?  But yours is just more, what you told me it happened last week, he's in the paper.  No, he's not.  Oh, my God.  What the hell?  It's a good story.  All right, here's what happened.  I'll set it up quick.  Iraq had a zoom in.  Robert was younger.  Hold on, hold on.  There's too much going on.  Sorry, I just got to say, Iraq just zoomed in more on Bob Kelly's belly, and I swear  I just saw Porkin's ship crash into it. 
[02:06:30]  Come on.  You're lucky, Opie, saved you right at the end of that.  Every friggin' Star Wars fan is laughing.  Look, I'm getting LOLs there, see?  Oh, up the yin-yang.  The gates are laughing at him.  Star Wars reference.  It's a Star Wars reference.  I had a lightsaber.  I'd cut your feet off.  I was saying that your belly is as big as a lightsaber.  I called it a lightsaber.  No, no, no, I meant the candy.  I meant the candy, but it's a fun-filled candy.  I didn't have to throw it really hard to remove the feet. 
[02:07:00]  I was just implying that his belly looked like the Death Star.  A lightsaber.  That's all.  A lightsaber.  Opie, Opie, Opie, forget it.  I tried.  I swung and missed, man.  All right, what's the story?  What are you doing?  I don't hear the story.  Why are you standing up here?  Why are you putting your hands in your pocket?  I say priest, and you all of a sudden start putting your hands in your pocket.  I want to hear the story.  All right.  Not that I did.  You're going to call and set it up.  A priest wants to kiss him on the neck, so then... 
[02:07:30]  Jesus, do you have to jump right after you were set up?  Well, no, I'm saying...  A set up, there's a story before what happened.  Robert, let me Bob.  Okay, yes.  Let the expert talk.  If he calls me Bob, I shut up.  Let the expert talk.  There's confidence in it.  Long story short, whatever happened, he ended up getting kissed in the neck by a priest who  he knew through a various situation.  And then he told me last week, that same priest, you know, who he'd like to give him confession  with, was in the news, wasn't he?  Yeah, he was caught up in that stuff a few years ago in Beantown.  Oh, that stuff? 
[02:08:00]  From Leicester.  Was it one of the big ones?  Because Bob was one of the most beautiful boys.  If you ever saw him when he was younger, he was lovely.  Yeah, I was actually around 22, actually, in my beautiful days.  He had a six-pack, a washboard stomach, Bob was a good-looking mullet, and a mullet.  You let a priest kiss you on the neck at 22?  Yeah, I let him.  At 22?  At 22?  No, I was actually doing something.  I can understand 12, 13.  Let me set it up.  It was an intimate moment, and he ended up at the end, the guy hugs him, but then Bob  just thinks he's hugging the priest because it's like a...  And then he kissed him on the neck.  And Bob was a very beautiful boy, as you know. 
[02:08:30]  Okay.  I actually was doing something like, almost like, you know, a confessional type thing.  You know.  Yes.  You know.  I was confessing certain things, and it was like a big moment.  Because, you know, I was...  You made it sound like you deserved it now.  I got out of Juvie Hall.  I was asking.  I got out of Juvie Hall and all this.  That was the government's first mistake.  Like a spiritual cleansing, in a way.  Just kind of, whatever.  Confession's good for the soul.  Right.  So I'm sitting there with him, and, you know, first of all, we were sitting there for like  an hour and a half.  And in the middle of me purging the deepest, darkest secrets I had, I look... 
[02:09:00]  He's snoring.  I look over.  He actually...  I'm not even kidding.  That's what really happens.  They don't give a crap.  I was almost in tears.  Like, this is really hard.  And I looked...  And I was like, excuse me, you know, Father.  And he was like, oh, yes, yes, yes.  He figures, why do I have to listen?  God's listening to this stuff.  Get to the cutie stuff.  Yeah.  I don't need to listen to this.  And we were there for like almost two hours.  And it was like, okay.  It was like this really big moment for me.  And we stood up, and he went to, you know, give me a nice hug. 
[02:09:30]  And right at the last second, we're hugging.  And I felt it.  I felt his hand.  You know when you hug a guy, it's like you hug, and it's done.  Yeah.  His hand kind of moved.  Like it kind of...  Ah, squeezed.  Where?  It kind of squeezed a little bit.  It like lifted, and then went back on.  Where?  On my back.  Do it to Jimmy.  No.  Why not?  Oh, what?  That's right.  It has to be shown.  He rocks.  Yeah, do it to Jimmy.  All right, so...  And here you go.  It was almost like Jimmy's...  Okay, there was the hug.  And then what?  This was the hug.  All right.  All right.  So far, it's a guy hug. 
[02:10:00]  Hang on.  I'm being the priest, and Jimmy's being the sexual guy.  We understand that.  I can't believe...  All right.  You explained that.  It's stupid.  Yeah, to the people that can't see.  It's stupid.  Yeah, but it opened.  You said that.  We're on the radio, you moron.  This isn't live television.  All right, so you explaining it is really going to make it...  That was three years ago.  All right, let's go.  It's over.  All right, let's go.  All right, so...  And then he kind of, like, caressed your back a little bit?  He did this.  All right.  And we're still hugging.  Right. 
[02:10:30]  Hang on.  You're not supposed to get turned on.  I don't want to get...  I'm not going to get the kiss.  My ass is out.  His ass was hanging out.  It's the last time I've been doing a man hug.  Honest to God, that is probably one of the softest bums I've ever thought in my life.  But then he needed, like, kind of like a cat.  No, we were there just, like, probably around three minutes too long, the hug was. 
[02:11:00]  Can I say something?  Three minutes.  Can I say one thing that's been bothering me the whole show?  Yeah.  Is when Madonna said bum instead of butt.  Listen to English accents.  I was saying bum.  Nobody wants to hear it.  We're not in England.  Because I messed up before and I said the...  You could say ass.  I know, but I'd rather pull way back and then, you know, loosen up a little bit.  I got a little carried away on myself.  So wait, how long did you hug this guy for, really?  Well, it was probably, like, it was a while, man.  It was a good, like, it was a two-hour emotional, like, spiritual moment. 
[02:11:30]  Were you crying?  No.  And he was hugging you for three minutes.  More than 30 seconds of the hug?  Oh, yeah.  More than 30 seconds.  And then he was kneading your back with his fingers a little bit and then he kissed you  on the neck.  And then he kissed you on the neck?  What kind of kiss was it?  It was a very soft, soft...  Did he feel whiskers?  No, but he really didn't have...  You know, he had those priest lips with a real thin, kind of like Jimmy's lips.  How do you know what priest lips...  How old was priest lips?  He knows what priest lips...  Typical priest lips.  You know, that Irish Catholic lip. 
[02:12:00]  There's no one can lip in his smile.  It's just gums and teeth.  How old was he?  He was old gray hair, man.  Who's an old priest?  Gray pubes?  Was I turned on?  No.  I immediately...  But the two hours of spiritual cleansing immediately got thrown in the toilet.  Why?  Because he just kissed me on the neck like the first girl I was ever with.  When you say thrown in the toilet, Jim doesn't look at that as a negative.  Absolutely.  Did you have clear liquid on your thigh?  Oh, for heaven's sake.  All right.  We got to go. 
[02:12:30]  There's our music.  Norton actually...  I mean, Colin was actually...  He cuddled and spooned.  All right.  We'll talk about that next.  Yes.  That's XM material.  Sorry.  We're going over to XM.  Thanks to the ladies on Pal Talk that have been wowing all morning.  We got Colin Quinn in the studio.  He's going to go over to the other side with us.  He's playing Carolines here in New York City all weekend long starting tomorrow night, Colin.  Damn right.  Colin killed on this side of the show today.  Very funny man, Colin Quinn.  The other side of the show we don't know about.  Well, we'll see.  We'll have to wait and see.  Bye.  Guys, thanks for your... 
[02:13:00]  Thanks.  For whatever.  We'll see you tomorrow if you're not joining us over there.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  A couple of minutes.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Cosby of the United Show.  The virus is spreading.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  We are live.  Colin Quinn in studio today playing Carolines in New York City all weekend long. 
[02:13:30]  Bob Kelly laying on the couch.  Are you tuckered out?  No, I just...  I didn't realize how comfortable this was.  He's being comfy.  I don't know why be uncomfortable.  He can move the mic down so he's laying down.  You call it comfy.  We call it homoerotic.  Actually, hey...  What is going on over there?  Norton's ordering.  Hey, you guys.  This is Norton.  All right.  You go.  If he can flip it, he can give you a couple of bucks.  Yeah, you go.  You do.  Oh.  And Jimmy's in the back room, so...  All right.  Turn down the rage.  We're about to broadcast again.  He's making room for a smoothie. 
[02:14:00]  Apparently, the smoothie thing that goes so smooth,  if I may say, when Kenny's here...  Yeah.  ...is a complete catastrophe when Kenny is not here.  Just getting a smoothie, the act of getting a smoothie,  is so complicated that papers are needed, pens, interns, money exchange.  Kenny is so efficient.  Yes.  And still, to this day, XM doesn't understand that.  I don't know why.  I don't either.  I don't know why. 
[02:14:30]  He does the job very, very well.  I gave him a few tasks on the way in today.  And Jimmy has seen this.  He tasks me.  You probably have seen this by this point, too.  I gave him a bunch of paperwork.  There were a couple things I needed mailed and something I needed FedEx.  Just dumb little things, right?  And I gave him the pile of this messy paper and envelopes and stuff.  And all of a sudden, he has to hold it with his thumb in his left hand as he drives into work.  I'm like, dude, I'll just hold it until you get to work.  He goes, no, that's okay.  I got it, G.H.  But it's obviously some weird OCD thing. 
[02:15:00]  Because I'm like, no, really?  You look like you're uncomfortable.  I can obviously hold it.  We're in a car until we get to work.  He goes, no.  And he insisted.  And it wasn't about being a bother or anything.  It had something to do with his OCD mind.  He's a psychopath.  We'll drive to Giggs.  And literally, we'll have two hours to go.  We'll have to go down to Exit 2 on the turnpike.  We get out of the Lincoln Tunnel.  It's Exit 15E.  And he's holding this in his left hand.  And the paper's bent because of his giant chimp thumb pushing in. 
[02:15:30]  He doesn't know his own strength.  And he'll just keep looking down.  I'm like, what are you looking at, dude?  It's Exit 15.  We have another 140 miles on the turnpike.  What do you think?  That Exit 2 is going to pop up in a half mile?  You drive home this way.  Every day, you idiot.  It has nothing.  Out of his mind.  What exit just passed?  It's an OCD thing.  He was squeezing with his thumb the pile of papers I gave him.  And I see him looking down and then looking at the road.  Looking down.  I'm like, would you stop looking down?  Oh, my God.  Why are you screaming from MapQuest? 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  MapQuest?  What a nav system.  Then he can't wait to move his thumb down when that direction is over with so he's got  the new one.  The next step, right.  He goes from step to step with that huge thumb of his.  He does MapQuest.  That's what he does.  He prints it out with his stupid color printer.  He really does.  You don't have to spring for it either.  It's free stupid.  Spring for it?  What are you saying?  Old man trying to talk about the internet.  Shut up.  He's talking about GPS we have now.  That's what you can buy.  Colin's putting quarters in the vents to the monitor. 
[02:16:30]  Spring for MapQuest.  That's a good point, Bob.  Good point.  All right.  Let's say hi to John in New York.  John, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Oh, someone's got to cover up this button.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh.  Just in case.  Ah.  That's what K-Rock in New York City is playing.  That's it.  After we go off the air, we're in the same studio, but this is what they're doing.  But I think we're now live on K-Rock. 
[02:17:00]  No.  We're talking through the song right now.  Can you hear us?  Yeah.  That's how close we are to getting fired because of some...  No.  That's not how that button works.  All right.  Don't yell at me.  I'm out of respect.  Way to get a bit, you asshole.  I'm sorry.  Jesus Christ.  A-hole was still on K-Rock.  Way to blow up my spot.  I know.  I was making a bit.  Steve and Thanh run in panicking.  That's not how it works.  No.  It's fine.  I will have to.  As much as I hate to, I will have to defend Thanh because I don't think he really  thought that you were worried and he was trying to comfort you.  Well, it's my acting. 
[02:17:30]  He didn't know that, though.  I got good acting.  You can't be mad at him because you're a good actor.  Does he know?  He's just dumb.  Look at him.  And I should apologize.  Mr. Faber-Sham, this button needs to be covered.  Needs to be covered.  Big, tall, recorded Kevin Costner bumbled in.  Okay, boss.  I do have to apologize, too, because he can kick my teeth out without even trying.  From there, a little spinning back kick.  Let's be honest with each other here.  I'm going to tell you what word you misspelled.  Why?  Is he a martial artist? 
[02:18:00]  Is that because of his...  Oh, boy.  Is it his Vietnamese last name?  Is that what it is?  No, it's Nathaniel, and they call him Thanh.  We haven't been able to really figure that out yet.  He looks like an 18th century painting.  What?  Hell, he looks like...  When fucking...  When Jay Moore said he looked like John Olerud, he also said he looks like C-3PO.  I guess I'm an old John Olerud joke, but I really had a good laugh at Nathaniel's expense.  John Olerud, wow.  C-3PO. 
[02:18:30]  Man.  All right, I apologize.  I was just going for a little quick bit, and...  I believed you, actually.  They did?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I did, because I don't think that's right, but I didn't know.  I'm moving on.  I believe you, too.  I'm moving on from this radio thing.  The acting is getting better.  Well, it's fantastic.  If you want, I can speak to...  They're going to do Cheaper by the Dozen 3 soon.  I have some connections.  He could be the youngest son, all grown up.  I want to see Greg Almighty.  That would be a good one.  I want to see him in an action movie.  Yeah? 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, like you're the tough cop.  Put a little dirt on his face.  We got David Caruso doing all that crap already.  No, Frank.  You're younger than him.  Let's do like an O.P. and Anthony movie.  Yeah, that's what we want to do.  You guys have to...  Well, I have a buddy movie where we what?  A buddy movie where you have to find...  Let's say Norton has A's,  and you have to find The Antidote by the end of the movie.  The Antidote for Hayden.  Is this a documentary?  Boy, that's going to be a boring movie.  It's going to be two hours of Ant and I just sitting around doing nothing.  It's like a radio show.  No. 
[02:19:30]  Jimmy loses weight by the minute.  It's a combination of an action movie and The Omen  where you try to figure out...  Do you know the liver spots on Norton's head?  You try to figure...  You try to find a scratch-off.  It's like a scratch-off lotto game.  And if there's a 666 underneath, you win.  Yes.  I guess you have people, real fans of Norton come up  and try to scratch off his head.  That was kind of hurtful, Jimmy.  Stick a GPS tag on him and follow him around the ocean for a month. 
[02:20:00]  That was pretty good.  I don't get what you say.  Oh, boy.  Hey, John in New York.  What's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey there, Jan.  Hey, John.  All right.  Wanted to thank you guys for bringing back the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  It was a proud member, initiated last night.  Oh, very nice.  Who was the other guy?  I think I was.  I did a little 69ing as well.  And all because of the radio show, right?  That's right.  I told her about it.  It was very good. 
[02:20:30]  I don't know why we didn't bring back Hummer Tuesday sooner.  It's a great way to break the ice.  Hummer Tuesday is back.  Thanks, guys.  So we realized days of the week on radio, you have to have something for every day.  And some shows just have one thing for a day.  We're trying to pile on things so every day we have three, four, five things for one day.  What's our biggest day?  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Whipping out Wednesday and butt rub Wednesday.  Butt rub Wednesday.  But then Jimmy, you know, he started something that's really not taking off. 
[02:21:00]  What?  What is it?  Cat noise Wednesday.  Cat noise Wednesday could fall by the wayside.  It shouldn't.  As I expect phone call Thursday to.  I think we drop phone call Thursday tomorrow.  What?  What is cat noise Wednesday?  Ask the freaking inventor.  What is it, Gordon?  I don't remember.  You just make a cat noise.  That sounds like something him and his girlfriend giggled at one night.  And she said, do it.  And he was too gutless to say no.  All right.  We've all been in that situation.  All right, Colin.  You hurt the whole room. 
[02:21:30]  You know that, right?  I'm laughing really hard.  I go, wait a minute.  Jimmy, would you like to do your cat noise for Colin?  I don't remember it, but I don't like the fact that Fat Squiggy just made fun of me.  That was rather hurtful.  Yeah, don't get mad at us because we all have girlfriends, you lonely bastard.  I don't remember cat noise Wednesday.  You made it up.  Oh, that was it.  No, but you had a nice cat noise.  I think you were doing the angry cat. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, that was it.  That was my bitch.  Oh, it's very angry.  You should be on Eric and Kathy with that.  No, but no, that was good.  People were like, I heard cats.  Yeah.  I had some other ones, too.  Oh, gosh, Jimmy.  What else did I have?  Oh, I had another one, too.  How about death rattle, Jim, Thursday?  Well, we hear you death rattle and you die.  Cat noise Wednesday is just not taking off.  I don't know.  We might have to scratch off the list.  We'll think about it next Wednesday.  I kind of liked it. 
[02:22:30]  It's scared me.  Yeah, there was also, there was water shake Wednesday.  That was supposed to be a big one.  What's that?  What was that?  It just shakes his water.  Yeah, I guess like the whole country will do it.  All right, go.  And everybody's riding around.  That's like how you show solidarity for the radio.  And we wonder why Colin Blunt is bitter.  Yeah, exactly.  And we wonder why you're bitter, Colin.  When water shake Wednesday is going to be a movie.  I'd love you to drown in your own blood tonight, Jimmy.  Anything I can do to facilitate that, please tell me.  Sit on my chest, fatso.  All right, look. 
[02:23:00]  I'll save that.  Yeah.  Dan is pointing out that tomorrow is a very busy show.  We got Fun Fact Thursday.  Fun Fact Thursday.  We got Phone Call Thursday.  Yeah.  Uh-uh.  It's Phone Call Thursday.  You're missing one.  That was mine, by the way.  You're missing my invention that's taking off.  Also, Perv News tomorrow.  Oh, I know which one.  Perv News Thursday and?  Camel Toe Thursday.  Thank you.  Camel Toe Thursday.  But only male camel toes.  Male camel toes.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You got to pull your pants up real tight.  That is.  And wear sweatpants and put one ball on each side. 
[02:23:30]  And it looks like you got this big, flat camel toe.  So, wear your sweats tomorrow, boys.  Everyone, wear your sweats.  Because it's Camel Toe Thursday.  The star of Camel Toe Thursday was Nathaniel.  Because it looked like he had a meat lasso on his pants.  It was really uncomfortable.  That boy does have a cock.  He wrecked it for everybody.  We're all having fun.  And then it was his turn.  It was like, oh, God.  He has a big piece.  He's got something going on.  He's not all ball.  He's 6'5"?  Yeah.  6'4". 
[02:24:00]  I saw the head.  It was somewhere down by mid-thigh.  It was really bothersome.  Could you stick a quarter in his hole?  I couldn't see that.  He wasn't wearing fucking white sailor pants.  He was wearing jeans.  Stick a quarter in his hole.  You ever see those fucking big open piss slits?  Oh, God.  I say piss slit Tuesdays.  We're like, we open up someone's piss slit and we go,  and you lick inside of it.  But you put vinegar on your tongue. 
[02:24:30]  It's uncomfortable for both of you on some level.  Dude, the pictures that are up on opandanthony.com  of us doing the camel toes are disturbing.  There's Jimmy doing one, but it's from the side a little bit.  You need the front view.  Yeah, but look at the face we're all making.  We're all creeped out.  Because it's all happy.  Everyone's having a good time.  Yeah, yeah.  And did you do one yet?  No, I haven't done one because my pants are too tight.  Why is there only one picture?  That's perfect.  No, you need looser like sweatpants.  Look at how creepy that looks.  Ope was fucking, Ope had just a big taffy bag mushed. 
[02:25:00]  All right, well, let's say hi to James the trucker.  James?  Hey, James.  Hey.  How y'all doing, man?  Jimmy, I can't let him throw any fuss, man.  Just for you, from all the truckers, there's a big old...  Thank you, sir.  Why do they always stick up for Jimmy?  Because they know Cat Noise Wednesday is a hit.  Cat Noise Wednesday blows.  And it's her ratings grabber. 
[02:25:30]  I like it.  Don't do this to Jimmy.  You know, we got to load the days up, but then slowly cull back some of the ones that  aren't working.  No.  Hey, Jimmy Fallon's on Regis.  He was just on our show.  I wonder if this is the Scissor Sisters show.  Oh, the Scissor Sisters.  This is a repeat.  He's in Best of?  Remember when we were talking about how Regis looked good yesterday?  Yeah.  It was a rerun.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  So you're a big fan of the Scissor Sisters.  And they turn out to be, like, gay gentlemen. 
[02:26:00]  How big is Fallon?  Geez, he's a big dude compared to that stupid Regis.  No, Regis is tiny.  Oh, is he a twerp?  Yeah.  His weight is small.  Really small.  Dominative.  And very miserable when he's not on TV.  Yeah.  And a little leprechaun.  Or looks miserable, I should say.  Alex from O-Town.  Bring it on, brother.  O-Town.  Don't make Orlando try to sound tough.  Huh?  I wanted to give you my cat noise, gentlemen.  Go ahead.  All right.  I think he just, like, squeezed his cat. 
[02:26:30]  Did he just squeeze a cat?  That was a duck.  Wow.  That wasn't bad.  I think he threw his cat into the drawing for that one.  Yeah.  Did he do that all the time?  That sounded pretty good.  Now they're just typing out meow on instant feedback.  Why do they always have to stick up for Jimmy?  Because cat noise one day.  Jimmy can't do no wrong with these guys.  I do a tremendous.  Have you ever read message boards?  I do a tremendous amount of wrong.  Cat noise Wednesdays is a hit.  We all know it.  It is a hit.  So you can make any cat noise. 
[02:27:00]  You can be a...  There you go.  Welcome to the club.  Thanks.  Per.  I like the fact that Colin is trying to have dignity and not be...  I'm not having dignity.  I'm so disgusted by cat noise Wednesday.  Thank you, Colin.  I'm with you.  I'm with Colin.  I get it.  It's fake irony.  Shut up.  No, it's not.  It's fun.  Cat noise Wednesdays is fun.  Shut you, trapper.  Everyone likes it.  So we make t-shirts.  That's when you know you got a hit on your hand.  Bumper stickers, yes.  Only whip them out Wednesday has a shirt. 
[02:27:30]  Sea monkey.  Jimmy.  Well, any Jimmy idea is printed on a t-shirt eventually.  Yeah.  I've not seen one catchphrase or anything else that you've said that isn't on a goddamn  t-shirt being sold by that stupid, fat, fucking limey.  You're British.  You could tell the limey that he doesn't need a backup 18-wheeler for Jimmy's merchandise,  by the way.  Yeah.  There weren't enough people in the venue to buy all the stuff he brought.  Yeah, Paul brings a lot of my stuff up.  I can't help.  Oh, my God. 
[02:28:00]  There was like Teamsters unloading Jimmy's merchandise at no speech.  One of the old ladies that have to print his t-shirts are just, like, disgusted.  One company wouldn't do it.  Really?  Slipping a puddle of AIDS.  Yeah, they wouldn't print that.  There was another rape on there.  They were like, no.  Huh.  Why?  I don't know.  Well, they didn't object to it.  Let's go to Wade in MN is Minnesota, I believe.  Hey, Wade.  Hey, Wade.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  Love you.  Those are some sweet numbers. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Fargo.  You're going to go for a game?  They like to do the Roland Meow cat noise.  Ha, ha.  Good.  Yeah.  Um, meow.  Wade, meow.  Meow.  Roland cat.  See, he's combining Roland with a cat.  Boring.  Jimmy, how was that a slam on me when it obviously trashed the show?  What?  Shut up. 
[02:29:00]  No, no, no.  Drop cat noise right now.  I was pointing at you and laughing because it was a joy.  I know, but I was trying to tell you it was ruining the show.  It's breaking it now.  What do you want, Colin?  Cookie eating Thursday?  Yeah.  From anyone else, that might be amusing.  Double lord.  Hey, uh, Redding's got a great idea.  Opie, you need to get back at Jimmy for Cat Noise Wednesday with Dog Noise Thursday.  No, that's the same thing.  Oh.  Too many animal noise.  We're going to be too stupid.  Yeah.  Bobby should be wearing a fez right now.  Huh? 
[02:29:30]  Bobby should be wearing a fez.  What is a fez?  A little hat with a...  They wear them in Morocco.  Those wacky hats.  There's a little tassel on it like when you graduate high school.  Fez.  He knows, though.  That's great.  Hey, uh, let's say...  They wear masks and things on their head.  It's crazy.  You're like a bunch of crazy people.  A bunch of crazy people.  What?  You know, you came...  I took a bunch of pills to get away from you.  I saw that last night.  The way he's holding his robe. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, you're not dying.  You're killing everyone around you.  Taking a lot of phone calls today.  It's not Thursday.  See you in your dreams.  Leon Shermer.  Leon.  He actually got his operation and then died of AIDS.  The Leon from Dog Day after...  His real name was not Leon.  I forget what his real name was.  But he did die of AIDS.  Yeah, recently, actually.  About four years ago.  But he was...  He played Dracula.  Yes, Chris Sarandon in the movie did.  I mean, the real guy.  Oh, that was Chris Sarandon in the movie? 
[02:30:30]  I didn't know that.  Yes.  You see, Jimmy, you're saying...  Do you want to die of AIDS?  Oh, no.  You're saying that?  No.  All right, let's say hi to Tony.  Tony.  Hey, what's going on?  I want to know if Anthony did love bug this morning before he left the house.  Of course.  I do love bug every morning with my sweetie.  I give a little love bug.  What's a love bug?  Love bug.  It's a little almost like a handshake.  It's a little secret love bug handshake.  It's not secret anymore.  See, yeah.  No one knows you do the love bug. 
[02:31:00]  You know, in Hawaii, they do like the love thing.  The hang thing.  It's almost the heavy metal rock horns thing.  The pointer in the pinky point straight up.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's a, you know, I love you thing.  And then you take the fingers that are bent toward your palm and interlock them and then  grab these around there and then you go, I'll see you later, baby.  Kind of like the brothers used to do the old handshake.  Yeah, yeah.  Only, you know. 
[02:31:30]  That's cute.  I do retard kisses.  Do you?  Yeah, we both do.  I know you.  I love you too.  And then we put our teeth like, like our mouths don't close.  Really?  And then we try to kiss.  But that's not at all cute or romantic.  If you think retards are cute.  Jimmy's is the worst.  What?  Meep, meep.  Oh, you better tell Colin.  Meep, meep.  What do you do?  What?  Your hero's in the room with you.  Meep, meep.  His girlfriend got a little mad that he let this one out. 
[02:32:00]  Why don't you tell Colin?  Go ahead.  What's the big deal?  What's the big deal?  Occasionally.  If she wants a kiss, she'll go, meep, meep.  And then I'll go, meep, meep, and kiss her.  That is the most horrendous thing.  Meep, meep.  Like a truck backing up his head?  Like, meep, meep.  No, no, not quite like that to find him.  Or sometimes it's straining, like, meep, meep. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden we meet and we kiss.  Oh.  Oh.  Colin just goes, ooh.  I do the vacuum.  See what you're missing, Colin?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  You just go, and then I suck her over to me, and then we kiss.  Oh, my God.  You do the same thing at the dinner table, don't you?  Yeah, with a rope.  I was going to go for a priest cock joke with dinner table.  This is better.  Well, touche, fatso. 
[02:33:00]  Let's go to D.  D is a piece of tablecloth.  Grandmother's color isn't it?  It's like when the plane got the hole shot in it in Goldfinger.  This is just a foot hanging out of my mouth.  D, Louisiana.  You're on the Opiate Anthony program.  D, me, me.  No.  No.  I like that one.  That's all right.  We have an employee that comes to our clinic, our office, once a month to kind of observe. 
[02:33:30]  And we nicknamed her CT for camel toe.  Because, you know, you shouldn't wear a scrub that too tight.  You know, one size does not fit all.  But anyway, she, we, I know we're going to get busted one day because we always say,  um, y'all hear that cat screaming like somebody's choking it and we'll start making cat noise.  Like, you know, it's like, and, uh, oh, it's bad.  Wait, now, what does the girl look, because camel toe can be really sexy or disgusting.  What does she look like? 
[02:34:00]  She's got scrubs on it, so it's got to be.  Is she fat?  Yeah, it's like the apron belly.  So it's like the camel toe is all the way up the belly.  Oh, she's a fat lady?  Yeah.  Uh, yuck.  Fat camel toe is awful.  Are you sure she wasn't stabbed?  Well, I'll ask her.  Why?  Why take the sexiness out of it?  You know what is really good?  Back camel toe.  It's when women are real fat and they have dual ass.  They have their big, fat ass from their hips.  But then in the middle, there's this mini ass that, like, is right there by the asshole. 
[02:34:30]  And it's the size of, like, you know, like a 10-year-old's ass.  But it's slammed in the middle of this big, fat ass.  My favorite is extra long butt crack.  Extra long butt crack.  Usually fat girls that have a flat ass, but their crack goes all the way up to their waistline.  Yeah, very, very long butt crack.  How about the girls with, like, two or three assholes? 
[02:35:00]  You ever see that?  What?  That was big in, like, the 80s.  Some girl would have, like, two or three butts.  You know, it was really weird.  I mean, I think it was just a, I think it was probably a fissure that turned into an ass.  A fissure, an anal fissure.  And what is it what you were talking about earlier?  Like, you watch a fucking porno or look at through one of those real hardcore porn magazines  that show fucking and blowjobs and shit.  And some guy's dick hole goes from, like, the underside of their dick all the way up to the top. 
[02:35:30]  Like, what happened?  It's a huge dick hole.  It's like they pee.  It's just, like, chowder pouring out of their cocks.  It's just a guy that had to get rid of kidney stones.  What do you mean?  No.  Is this?  I don't know.  Like, it goes from the underside all the way up to the top.  Yeah, like, their pee hole doesn't close.  It's always open.  Yeah, this big red fucking...  Yeah, it looks like an eye socket.  It's always singing opera.  An eye socket.  After Arnold pulled the fucking eye out in the original Terminator. 
[02:36:00]  There's always a little bit of blood on it.  It might be old clothes as it, like, shuts.  Well, it's airtight.  Yeah, it's like a little...  It shuts, but...  To be watertight.  Uh, Bob killed here last weekend.  Ah, whatever.  Let's say hi to Peter in Massachusetts.  Peter, what's up?  What the fuck kind of sabotage are you?  What the fuck?  Where did he kill?  Fucking...  Peter.  No, we blew off that call and went to Peter.  What's up, Peter?  You ever see those chicks where the pants are too tight and their stomach's hanging over 
[02:36:30]  the top?  You know what that's called?  Muffin...  Muffin top, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The muffin top.  Sure.  A little too much of the ass meat, you know, popping out there on the top.  Meow!  Oh, no, no.  No, no.  No.  No.  No.  You don't always have to follow Jimmy's lead.  The more you say no, the more you're going to do it.  Of course.  I know.  That's my part in this bit.  Thanks, Colin.  Well, how about this?  My part in this bit is this. 
[02:37:00]  Hold on.  The ozone midget sighting of the day.  Yeah.  You're going to interrupt a midget sighting.  What's that coming?  Oh, is it really a midget sighting or that's just...  Yes.  Yeah.  We don't fool around about that.  No.  Don't worry.  This bit works perfectly, too, because we go...  We'll write back to you.  Okay.  You'll see.  You'll see the beauty of the show in a second here.  Wow.  Who saw this coming?  It's Chris in Kentucky.  Chris, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  I was sitting out at the Walmart parking lot and this big F-350 pulls up.  And look who's driving it.  It's this little midget-looking dwarf-looking guy. 
[02:37:30]  He jumps out and it's like he almost fell to the ground.  It felt bad.  And I looked over and the guy coming out on the other side is, I guess, his little worker  or buddy or whatever.  And I was just staring and kind of watching him.  And he grabs one of the carts and starts riding it up like a little kid would do.  And then I saw him walking out and he did the same thing. 
[02:38:00]  That's adorable.  Yeah, we like midget sightings there, Colin.  Yeah.  Is that it there, Chris?  They're the cutest.  All right.  There you go.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  Oh, yeah.  I like that seamless production value.  We're ready for Steven Spielberg, aren't we?  He's got my resume.  Wonderful.  What do you think of?  Nothing.  I'm just thinking about writing my Opie and Anthony movie. 
[02:38:30]  All right.  Yeah.  Can we put Big A in it?  Oh, yeah.  He'd have to be.  Maybe he's a villain.  He should be a villain.  Yeah, a villain.  He is an unknowing villain.  He doesn't even know.  Yeah, he's like, tell me about the Rabbits George guy.  Yeah, he's killed thousands by accident.  He blacks out when he's driving his cab and then suddenly he's in Van Cortland Park with blood on his hands.  And he's like, I don't know what happened. 
[02:39:00]  All right.  He just picks up prostitutes to pet their hair.  Yes.  And they're dead.  Carried away when they scream because he pulled.  Choked.  Their heads are backwards.  Looking at that sick, glazed over eyeballs, staring.  And then you look down and just see her shoulder blades.  And he's just yelling at them like they're his mother and he has an ejaculate in his pants.  Why did you make me sleep in the basement?  I wasn't going to bother my sisters.  All right.  Let's go with Spike in Nevada. 
[02:39:30]  Spike.  Spike.  Yeah.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, I got a great Hummer Tuesday story for you.  The Hummer Tuesday is going to take off.  Yeah, that one's a keeper.  I'm glad we brought that back.  All right.  What do you got, Spike?  About 2 o'clock in the morning, I'm driving my truck across Nebraska, and there's absolutely  nothing to see and nothing to do.  And my girlfriend got out of the sleeper.  And I'm telling you, she is the greatest girlfriend in the world.  She gobbled my knob like a black chick with a block of government cheese. 
[02:40:00]  It was beautiful.  Oh, that's great.  Terrific.  I was waiting for that.  And you got the Hummer all because of the radio show?  Partly, yeah.  Well, partly that.  And, well, she's just a dirty girl.  I like her.  Love you, Jimmy.  Oh, hey, you guys need a T-shirt that says Cock Me.  Nothing but Cock Me.  And I'm punching out. 
[02:40:30]  See ya.  All right.  Let's go to Melissa in Utah.  Melissa.  Hey, what's up?  You're the last phone call before the break, so make it good, because we're dying to slow  death here.  What do you got?  Well, my husband told me it was Hummer Tuesday.  He actually gets one every day.  But it was really good yesterday.  Really good?  Why was it so much special?  So much more special yesterday.  Why was it so much more special yesterday if you do it every day?  Well, because we have to, I don't know, make it official every Tuesday, I guess. 
[02:41:00]  But, yeah.  Oh, they're just fine.  Well, it's not Wednesday.  Hold on, hold on.  Anthony asks a very good question here.  If you're giving Hummers every day, why was yesterday special?  What was different about yesterday's Hummer?  Gulp.  I don't know.  It was just extra good.  It was, uh...  Because I knew I was doing it for a reason, not just, you know...  Did you work your finger into his crack and then pull it out and your finger smelled like  onions? 
[02:41:30]  No.  Did you let his friend, did you let his friend watch from the closet?  No, no, nothing like that.  Well, then what's special about it?  Yeah, what was special about it?  Well, I just, uh...  I don't know.  After he blew a load in your face, did you go, thank you, now I'm going to shut the fuck  up for the rest of the day?  No, no, I didn't...  Wow.  I'm saying that'll be nice.  Wow.  And that's...  Don't disrespect me.  Just describe it.  Just describe it from beginning to end.  Yeah, let's, uh... 
[02:42:00]  Let's get into this a little bit.  Let's get into it?  Just describe it.  He came in, you sat down, you got down, you know, you kneeled down, whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah, what was the position?  Well, last night, he had to go to work early, so he went to bed, and, you know, it was Tuesday,  so I had to be, you know, last thing of the day that happened, and, uh, just started  going down on him, and, and, yeah, I made it official for summer Tuesday.  Did you just move his underwear to the side?  Yeah. 
[02:42:30]  And then, uh, and then what happened?  What happened after that?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, he, he, I guess you could say he blew his load all over me.  I guess you could say.  Well, then what happened?  So, oh, yeah, it happens quite often, but, yeah, it was special on Tuesday.  Well, they kind of...  Really?  All right, so after, after that, uh, what happened?  Oh, well, after that, then I kind of, I guess I made him excited, so, uh, went from there. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, but after that, what happened?  Yeah, what happened?  Yeah, after that.  That's what we're getting at here.  What happened after that?  After that?  Yeah.  Yeah, we, I don't know if I can swear on your station, but, yeah.  No, you can.  I can, okay, after that, we, we fucked, and we had good sex.  Hey!  It's Utah.  Uh, so, um, then what happened?  And then what happened?  Yeah. 
[02:43:30]  Well, and then he, he went to bed, and he had a, had a good night's sleep, and, yeah.  Yeah.  So he went to bed.  Wait, so he went to bed.  So, um, then what happened?  And what happened after he went to bed?  Yeah, because you're, you know, still.  What happened?  Oh.  Yeah, obviously, you can't just go to bed.  Something else had to happen.  So what happened?  He, I don't know, he went to sleep, and, yeah.  And I told him, uh, next, next Tuesday, we'll make sure it happens again. 
[02:44:00]  So, yeah.  But then what, though?  What happened after that?  You're not saying.  After he went to bed?  Yeah.  She was very badly raped, you see?  That happened.  You see?  After he went to bed, we just.  You just gotta, you just gotta finish the story so we go to break.  So what happened?  Oh, okay.  Well, after he went to bed, we just kind of played around some more, and then I tucked him 
[02:44:30]  in, and he had a good night.  And?  Oh, yeah.  No, and, and then.  And?  And, uh, after he blew his load all over me?  Yeah, what happened?  That, uh, that's all that happened.  You're leaving something.  I, I think he was pleased.  With what?  What happened? 
[02:45:00]  I don't, what happened?  He said he was pleased, so what happened?  Well, he had, we had some good sex, yeah.  And that's, you want details?  Yeah, of what happened.  What happened?  He just, I went down on him, he went down on me, and.  Um, no, we know, but then, after that, what happened?  Yeah, you tell a really bad story. 
[02:45:30]  You're not, you're not getting to the point of what happened.  Well, nothing happened.  He got his good, um, his home or two day, and, and that's, that's what happened.  We had some, some good sex, and he went to bed.  And the other thing, what happened?  The other thing.  With the rest, yeah, with the rest of the, what happened?  I don't, I don't know what you're talking about. 
[02:46:00]  We just, uh.  Wow, you sound really confused.  It's our job as a radio show to ask you what happened, and then you tell us what happened.  So, uh, what happened?  What happened?  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't know what you're talking about.  We're waiting. 
[02:46:30]  Ah, there we go.  Finally.  Jesus.  I love the confusion.  All right, more with Colin Quinn, who's at Caroline's this weekend here in New York City.  Woo-hoo!  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Rolling right along.  It's Opie and Anthony, Bob Kelly, Jim Norton, of course. 
[02:47:00]  Of course.  Whoa, hey, there's something I don't see every day.  Oh.  Of course, it's Whip Him Out Wednesday on Pal Talk.  Uh, deliver us from Eva.  It's being a good sport today.  And of course, Colin Quinn playing, uh, Caroline's here in New York City all weekend long.  Is she the only one flashing today?  Have a lot of girls flashed on Pal Talk?  Big boobies.  Big boobies!  Big boobies on the camera.  Those are very impressive.  Hello.  Anyway. 
[02:47:30]  Wonderful.  Very nice.  It looks like two Nortons leaning off a bridge.  We, uh, we went into break and they played a promo for What the Hell Is That?  And everyone is pissed off.  They're like, fix the fucking audio.  What happened?  Is it out of phase or something there, Steve?  It's coming in way too much.  I don't know.  Holy shit, who the fuck did that?  What the hell is that promo?  The volume levels were all fucked up and the mix sounded awful.  Steve.  Ask Steve.  It's coming in from all the country.  And then ask Steve why he stole Snake Plissken's shirt.  Great shirt. 
[02:48:00]  Hey, I like that reference.  Unseasonably warm out.  Huh?  Unseasonably warm out.  You are the Duke of New York.  You're a number one.  Steve dressed like the guitarist in the Beaver Brown Band.  Eddie and the Cruisers.  At least his eyebrows grew back.  That was disturbing.  Did they?  Let me see.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Lucky.  All right.  Finally.  Freaking cancer patient for a month and a half.  All right.  Why don't we play this promo? 
[02:48:30]  Let me hear what's wrong with this thing.  Yeah, let me hear it.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, you can barely hear it.  Could be the most disgusting program you've ever heard.  What the hell is that?  Bacterial vaginosis.  That is effed up.  Just to clarify, it doesn't leak on its own.  Oh, my God.  What are you, crazy?  What are you, insane?  What does he have?  He has rotting corneas.  What do you have? 
[02:49:00]  I have rotting corneas.  Wow.  Let's just say he's got a grove.  Oh, my God.  It's the return of What the Hell is That on the Opie and Anthony Show.  If there's something on your body and you're pretty sure it doesn't belong there, call the  Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  What the hell's the prognosis?  What do you think it is?  What is the C sign?  Cankersore.  Cankersore.  Our highly trained staff, which may or may not include a medical professional, will evaluate  your oddity and then point a path accordingly. 
[02:49:30]  For more information, visit our website or email travis at foundrymusic.com.  So it sounds fine from where we sit.  They're saying the levels are all over the place, though.  It might be something that has to do with XM.  I'll give it to Derek.  By the way, love the promo.  Yeah.  What are we doing?  What the hell is that?  Was Twato the best one ever?  Well, didn't you want to do it during the Philly thing?  That was horrendous.  No.  She is disgusting.  No.  What the hell? 
[02:50:00]  No.  Oh, no, no.  I'm thinking something else.  That's weird.  Philly, we're doing the strangest thing you own.  Just don't ever wave your hand like that against you.  Steve went, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  And he put his hand in the, oh, Pshaw.  Oh, Pshaw.  Oh, you masher.  We got to do what the hell is that?  Leave the lover boy outfit alone.  Steve's working for the weekend.  Might as well.  He certainly does it Monday through Friday.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  When are we doing what the...  Give me a chance.  You shoot the guy.  That was hurtful, Jim. 
[02:50:30]  Can we set a day for what the hell is that?  Of course we can.  Can we get it on the docket?  Sure.  The docket?  Yes.  I forgot, man, how great that show was that day.  Oh, it's fantastic.  You saw Twato.  Colin Quinn saw Twato.  That's why Norton quit smoking from one of the what's wrong with that people.  That's why it was from that, yes.  So Twato is the most horrifying thing.  I still, to this day, I still, you know what I mean?  Sandy Cain, who was part of the Phil Spector trial.  I still, to my favorite of all time for going to Opie in the middle of a room full of people.  Opie, you want a blowjob when he's going to Bethany? 
[02:51:00]  He goes, no.  She goes, what are you, Gary?  Yeah.  I thought it was humiliating.  Yeah, that's the problem.  What are you, Gary?  Yeah, the problem is, yeah.  Hey, she yells at her questions.  Yeah, that's the problem.  Help, you want a blowjob?  Maybe it has something to do with the genital war she got hanging off half your body.  And her asshole.  What a point.  Oh, my God.  Her asshole.  She had her own mustard.  Her homemade mustard inside of her asshole.  That was tickening, right?  Twato for the newbies.  Right off her lips. 
[02:51:30]  Her labia.  No, about an inch off.  I mean, it had nothing to do with her private area.  Get a photo up.  It was half a ear just hanging there.  Yeah.  Half a, like, mouse ear.  Yeah.  Just hanging there.  Like a wild mushroom.  It looked like the consistency of cauliflower, too.  It was bumpy.  I want to chew it.  Oh, no, you don't.  Somebody, Paulo, Paulo from Rana Fenton's show, ended up kissing it and licking it on our show.  He suckled it.  Yeah, on our show or whatever. 
[02:52:00]  He suckled it.  He looked at one in the asshole, too.  She had one in her asshole.  Yeah, then she mooned us and showed something growing out of her ass.  She had a big roid.  That was just as bad.  Her asshole is what made me throw up.  The Twato made me puke, but her asshole was fucking atrocious.  Just this big, nasty, old woman asshole.  It looked like an infected operation.  Yeah.  By the way, when we played the promo, it was fine, so it has something to do when XM plays  it over there, over at the other studio that they're rebuilding.  Yeah.  Oh, you can't see it in that picture. 
[02:52:30]  All right.  Can you get these pictures up on opianathony.com?  They are.  Are you going to close up?  Yeah, but are they easy to find?  I'll put them on the headline.  Yeah.  We'll put them on the headlines for everybody.  Headline.  Huh?  I want to get a close up because I haven't seen Twato in years.  I made Twato my aim icon for like a month.  Yeah.  And everybody hated me.  Disgusting.  You imagine what Twato would smell like if you bit into it?  Ow.  Fuck.  I wonder what the consistency is.  Like, I made it's calamari.  No, gristle. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, gristle.  Yeah, like gristle.  It would crunch when you bit it, but not in a crunchy Captain Crunch way.  In a gristle, like meat gristle way.  You imagine 69ing with her?  And like you're chewing on Twato.  Yeah.  And her asshole is right over the nose.  Right on.  Right on.  You suck Twato.  You lick through her pubes.  Oh.  Her ass hair had like three colors.  All right, hold on.  We got a picture up where I forgot we painted it yellow. 
[02:53:30]  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  Man, it's northeast of her puja.  You can't miss it.  Yeah, it is large, man.  I'm sure she wasn't playing paintball.  I forgot we used to paint it.  Like an aerial shot of Asia.  We used to paint it when we got bored.  It looks like she has gum caught in her views.  Eating her pussy and he just put his gum there.  Spit his gum out in her twat.  Oh, my God.  Here's the...  Oh, my God. 
[02:54:00]  Ah.  Wow.  There's Paula licking...  Was that Paula?  Yeah, right.  Paula licking it.  Look.  Look, Bobby.  Come on.  He's got...  Bobby, look.  Can we see the asshole?  Yeah, show Bobby the asshole.  Wow.  You really can zoom in on that picture.  I don't know why you painted it because it looks...  The skin value looks worse.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's see if we can find...  Definitely.  Let's see if we can find an asshole for Bobby here.  Let's find the asshole shot.  Yeah.  It's all...  It's...  There you go.  You guys know. 
[02:54:30]  Are you kidding me?  He's licking her asshole.  Are you kidding me?  Look at him licking that ass.  Who is that?  That's Paula.  Paula's crazy.  And he's...  Oh, my...  His face is buried in her ass.  Did he get anything for that?  No.  No.  It's kind of...  Nothing.  He just stuck his head in her asshole.  That's for the notoriety.  That's right.  You want to talk about schizophrenia?  I'm watching you guys talk about this and look at this on the other screen.  Rachel Ray with Courtney Thorne Smith talking about according to Jim.  The two ends of the spectrum in American life. 
[02:55:00]  Right?  Twato.  Yeah.  Hey, Courtney, the Smith...  More bitter Colin Quinn.  We love bitter Colin Quinn.  He doesn't understand what the hell's going on in entertainment.  No.  I really don't.  Show me the open asshole, Eric.  Do we have it?  Yeah.  Why are you being shy?  Let's go.  Norton's like Scorsese.  Show me the open asshole, Eric.  Do we have it up yet?  Hey, we don't have that.  You have that shot.  What happened?  What happened?  No.  No.  All right.  We'll try to find it.  Other than for Valentine's Day, we painted it red. 
[02:55:30]  This growth of hers.  Look at it red.  We got all the colors representing.  Look at that.  Jesus.  And her little teddy.  That's horrendous.  She looks like a corpse with a teddy on.  That looks like one of those Easter egg ducks.  Why was it painted?  Because we ran out of things to do with it.  Man.  You forgot.  There's only so much you can do with it. 
[02:56:00]  That is so fucking disgusting.  I want to take it all with pliers.  Remove with a shotgun.  All right.  Fucking a nice razor.  Anyway, listen.  You should have that removed and then have somebody eat it.  Like just swallow it whole.  Just have it removed, put it in a jar, and then somebody swallows it whole.  All right.  Listen.  We're going to get what the hell is that.  Part do.  Part of dicks.  We got to get that done in the next couple of weeks.  What do you say?  What do you say?  Get her done.  We'll get her done.  There it is. 
[02:56:30]  Unpainted.  Oh.  That's my story.  Look at it.  Oh, God.  That is a piece of cauliflower.  It's like different little segments on it.  It's like a foot.  It's like a foot.  That is a foot.  It looks like a baby's foot.  Like a newborn's foot.  It looks like a brain.  It's a little brain.  Dude, you're not kidding.  It looks like a tiny little baby.  It is.  You think it's a conjoined twin?  Or a little baby fist trying to poke out.  It's a little meaty turtle shell.  It's a little meaty turtle shell.  No, that's you you're thinking of.  I got a ride. 
[02:57:00]  I'm going to puke.  Yeah, right on that.  What's it look like?  A piece of sushi.  What kind of sushi does that look like?  Fucking shrimp.  Arquipus.  Arquipus.  Yeah.  No, like super white tuna.  All right.  Let's move on.  Jim in Canada.  So what the hell is that coming back to the show?  Jim, what's up?  Yeah, hi.  There's a website you can check out.  It's SheMuscle.com.  SheMuscle.com.  Hurry, Eric.  Hurry.  Hurry.  The delay is going to kill us.  Is that the girl with the big clit? 
[02:57:30]  SheMuscle.com.  All right.  She in Canada?  Did we lose?  Too many people went for it?  Come on.  Oh, no.  Ew.  Oh, these chicks are big clits.  I love these chicks.  What?  Who the what the?  You can also say it another way.  Who the?  What the?  Thank you, Colin.  Why are we looking at SheMuscle.com, Jim?  Why wouldn't we be?  Why are we looking at this? 
[02:58:00]  It looks like guys with tits.  Jim, explanation, no?  Okay.  Please.  Jim?  You're just beautiful.  They're not beautiful.  Not at all, man.  What?  Well, there's nothing unattractive.  Jim has his hands down his pants.  I always do.  Jim, do you like SheMuscle.com?  No, not really.  Not really.  They're too masculine.  It's my birthday this weekend.  I like your girl with the big clit.  You have lost only 50 on Saturday, and he wants something special done. 
[02:58:30]  At the Mohegan Sun show?  Yeah.  It's my birthday.  I like to show him his fucking lung x-rays with a big black spot on it.  Happy birthday, stupid.  He just bought a Porsche, too.  A brand new Porsche.  A new one?  Well, it's a 2003.  That's what I mean.  A new Porsche to Voss in 2003.  He pulled up at the cell last night and pulled right in front.  Of course he did.  He sat there.  And he makes it look like, ah, I just happened to pull up.  You want to like to get him for his birthday? 
[02:59:00]  A bottle of whiskey and a fucking guardrail.  All right.  Are we done with SheMuscle.com?  Oh, Jimmy.  And his ass is red again.  What's wrong with you?  Why does your ass get red?  He's got a rash.  He's got a little baby boy rash.  No one has baby skin.  All right.  Get some baby rash.  We're going to move on to the carpenter who makes spanking kits to give to parents. 
[02:59:30]  What?  It's come down to this, guys.  Spanking kits?  It's come down to this.  I hope he tries, but it's come down to this.  We've hit the old wall.  Let's take a listen to this.  Joey Salvati says four conversations with the Lord in his shower convinced him to create  spanking panels to punish unruly children.  Jesus.  This guy's great.  That's what the Lord's up to?  Spanking pedals.  Yes.  All the shit going on in the world.  This is what the Lord is into. 
[03:00:00]  This is his thing.  Cool space this guy's also built.  Spanking pedals.  Get another use.  The Lord said they should eternally sleep.  The lid is cut off.  Put the lotion in the bag.  If you have to do something with your child, if you do it this way, at least you're getting  their attention, but you're not harming them.  And he's giving these pedals away, 1,400 of them so far, along with an owner's manual of sorts, everything  from how many swats to apply, to an appointment card for scheduling the spanking. 
[03:00:30]  But always, as the website says, to be used lovingly and never in anger.  Right.  And they take American Express and MasterCard.  Get one for this show.  Yeah, absolutely.  Let's get one.  What parent is scheduling a spanking with this creep?  Especially for this dude, yeah.  And never in, what did he say?  In love?  Never in anger?  Never in anger.  Always in love.  You do.  He's right out in the appointment card.  So you can see if the youngster has a conflict.  No, no, no.  Like 1130, I have an alcohol-fueled molestation. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, because when we got hit, when we were kids, it was out of love, right?  There was no anger involved whatsoever.  None at all.  Oh, and I was getting smacked with anything.  Okay, let me explain something.  What, what?  The girl's online with her tits out making her Nazi answer.  She's Zig Highling.  She's Zig Highling with her tits hanging out.  Oh, my God.  She looks like a frowline.  That's so funny.  It's true.  What happened with the other girl there?  I'll tell you, if Babe O'Brien had that attitude, we might still have the Reich. 
[03:01:30]  All right, back to the creep with the paddles.  Spanking kids.  Yeah, spanking kids.  There's got to be some kind of, like, you know, mixed message, you know what you think?  Yeah.  I would agree.  But there's some parents who don't know what to do with their kids.  You know, they've tried everything.  But they might have tried beating their kid.  Okay, the last rule on this page is give your child a hug.  Tell them you love them.  But Salvati believes his paddles and his spanking plan do make a difference. 
[03:02:00]  But Dad never hit me.  But you know what?  Dad is going to hit you this time.  Okay?  It might be the last time.  Because you know that he will do it.  It's not that he wants to do it.  But if he follows these rules, he's not going to beat you.  He's going to smack you.  And he's going to talk to you.  This guy sounds like a school learning.  As he's talking right now, he's probably wearing white spandex bike shorts and has a giant fat tent in them. 
[03:02:30]  He's like, he's going to spank you.  He's going to hit you.  He's going to touch you a little pee-pee.  He sounds like the BTK killer.  Yeah.  And then I walked in the house.  Yeah.  Shot him in the head.  What a creep.  There's a certain age where spanking becomes fun.  Does it?  Two.  Two.  There was never any thought to my spankings. 
[03:03:00]  Never in love, out of love.  My spankings came out of anger from one or two of my parents for something I did that pissed them off.  Spankings?  And it wasn't a spanking.  It was a fucking spanking.  Spanking is like, oh, naughty, naughty.  These were like, well, with a fucking belt, with a leather belt on my ass, laying down on the bed with like, as he spoke what I did.  And every syllable, it was like, what did you do with that clock? 
[03:03:30]  You broke it and should make sure it is fixed the correct way.  I'm like, what the fuck?  I could stop.  He got hit on the syllables.  Yeah.  It was like every word he would hit me with and every syllable.  See, my father was always out of anger.  He'd always go, now go in there and put that dress on.  And then he'd make me traipse out.  And every time he'd smack me, I'd have to say, I'm a pretty girl, but I don't behave. 
[03:04:00]  Norton wearing a dress and Doc Martens.  You know the song, celebrate, celebrate, celebrate, dance to the music.  I think it's, no, not that one.  Sly and the Family Stone.  Yeah.  Is that them?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good times?  I was singing that.  Celebrate good times?  No, no, not that one.  The electric slide?  Yeah.  No, it was the one.  Celebrate, dance to the music.  I thought it was Three Dog Night.  Yeah, maybe.  Is it Sly? 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, Three Dog Night.  Whatever.  That one.  Okay.  I was singing that early one Saturday morning.  I was singing that early one Saturday morning.  And I was a kid, very young, but I didn't know.  And then I started singing, celebrate, celebrate, dance to the music.  And then I'd go, masturbate, masturbate, dance to the music.  Just because it was a word I heard.  And not knowing why or anything.  My father comes out hungover, all groggy, out of the room, like rubbing his eye.  And just walks up to me.  He goes, whack, right across the face. 
[03:05:00]  I fell off the table because I was singing on the table.  Like I had a microphone.  And I'm like, celebrate, celebrate, dance to the music.  Masturbate, masturbate, dance to the music.  And wham, he smacks me.  I fly off the table not knowing why he just fucking did it.  But the best part is he's still rubbing his eye.  Oh, he's still like he's tired.  He's like, because he's laying in bed in his underwear probably going, what the fuck is that kid saying?  Actually, my cousin had a similar situation when.  And Joey took care of her.  No, but my grandmother was sitting here. 
[03:05:30]  She was on the back of the couch.  She's on the back of the couch.  And she goes, I got cum on Eileen.  And my grandmother smacked her over the back of the couch.  Over the back of the couch.  I got cum on Eileen.  All right.  Masturbate.  Masturbate.  Masturbate.  Maybe you didn't want to become a hackstack comedy guy.  Yeah, that was it.  Jesus, my career.  It would have been worse.  It made my career.  It would have been worse if he came out in chaps, like swinging a belt like a lasso and doing it.  And actually showing me what I was singing about. 
[03:06:00]  Sing, boy.  There's a theme to all your dad's stories.  He was very worried that you were going to become a little light in the loafers or something.  Gay.  Any father, I think, has that in the back of the head.  But that was like where the forefront of my dad was like, you know, you're in man training.  When I went out to California, he was like, you're in man training.  What do I got to do today?  All right.  Look, you want to drink a beer?  Yeah, that'd be great.  I'd love to drink a beer with the guys.  You know, drink a nice cold Coors. 
[03:06:30]  You're 12 years old.  Drinking with the guys.  Okay.  Sit on this bull for eight seconds and I'll let you have a beer.  Are you kidding?  And it was a Brahma bull, but it wasn't one of those you see at the rodeo, the giant ones.  It was a baby, but it wasn't a little tiny one.  Big enough for a 12-year-old.  It was a scale for my size.  Who did it look like in this room right now?  Ah, Bob.  Like Bobby.  Oh, Bob.  Oh, Bobby.  And I got on the thing and they strap your hand in and let it out of the gate. 
[03:07:00]  And I fell right off on my ass.  But you know something?  They gave me the beer anyway.  But they laughed.  They were all laughing.  And then they're going, now get out of there.  Get out of the arena.  Because the thing turns around to kill you.  You were there when you fall off.  Yeah, it was like fun.  It was your dad and his friends getting drunk and making you do silly things.  I would do that.  And then they'd have parties over this guy, Jimmy Jackson's house.  Jimmy Jackson is a guy.  He was crazy.  And he had this rent string of horses.  And he used to weld things.  So he welded together a chariot and hooked it up to a horse. 
[03:07:30]  And rode through town.  Central Islep?  No, this was out in California.  And the horse got spooked and ran between two parked cars.  And just ran.  The chariot hit these cars and just destroyed.  It's amazing the damage a chariot can do to a couple of cars.  But these are the people we're dealing with.  So they would party and drink and get all drunk.  So I went around back to take a leak.  And there was this Indian woman.  You know, the like out west.  Woo-woo-woo Indian women.  And her husband. 
[03:08:00]  That's not politically correct.  The wild Indian.  Wild Indian.  Right, right.  Red skin.  Out there.  Woo-woo Indians, yeah.  And she was married to this guy that just got out of prison.  And she was laying there.  I'm a native American.  She had like her top almost off.  It was a halter top kind of thing.  And she goes, you want to take a roll in the hay?  And I'm just kind of standing there like, oh boy.  Oh, mixed signals.  Because, you know, my hormones are gone and I kind of want to smoke signals.  But her husband reminded me of, who was Gans' partner? 
[03:08:30]  Billy Bear.  Billy Bear.  I'm Billy Bear with a big knife for 48 hours.  You want to know part of that?  So I like ran away all scared.  But it was nothing but like sexual attraction by older women or sometimes old Mexican men.  What was it?  Yeah, the Mexican man.  The Mexican man tried to pick me up when I was out in California.  Yeah, I'm just sitting there.  And again, everybody's drunk.  And this Mexican guy comes up and goes, hey, you want to go in the bushes? 
[03:09:00]  Over there.  I was like, excuse me?  He goes, me and you, you go in the bushes.  And my father heard it.  That was fun.  I know.  Me, a Mexican guy in the bushes.  Nice, unclipped.  And your father heard it?  Oh, my father heard it and beat the piss out of this guy in front of his relatives.  Because he was like a relative of Mexican guys that had a stable right next to ours.  And that was where the party was.  And just like bounced this guy off of this car.  He was like, what the fuck did you say to my son, you motherfucker? 
[03:09:30]  Just pounded him.  And then the Mexicans were like, Joey, Joey, come down.  It's okay.  He's a fucking asshole.  And they kicked him out of there, you know?  He was out of the car.  It was some good times.  Oh, good times.  Good times.  What about the story where they set you up?  Yeah, that was Jimmy Jackson's house, too.  Yeah.  Jimmy Jackson was leaving to go to the auction to pick up more fucking dog meat horses for  his rent string.  His rent string was pathetic.  It was horses that were diseased.  Yeah, I got two stories.  You got to tell the one you're telling.  And then you got to tell the horse story.  Oh, yeah, that one, too. 
[03:10:00]  That was another Jimmy Jackson one.  Jimmy Jackson is like quite the character out in California.  And he was always scamming stuff.  And so he was going to Chino to buy some horses.  So I was left to run the rent string with his wife, Patty, who was this young, blonde  woman.  So Patty was, he goes, Patty's sleeping.  He goes, don't worry about it.  Just take care of the rent string.  And I saw his truck pull away.  Well, apparently, he, well, he pulls away.  I see that. 
[03:10:30]  I go into the house to get something to eat.  And I hear Patty go, Anthony.  I was like, okay.  I look in the room.  And she's sitting there with the sheet just pulled up above her breasts.  And she taps on the bed.  And she goes, why don't you come on in here?  I go, I don't think so.  She goes, Jimmy's gone.  She goes, come on in here.  Let's have some fun.  And I just kept saying, I go, no, I can't.  How old were you now, 12?  I was probably 12 or 13 around there somewhere.  They just fucked with him, man.  And I just kept insisting no.  And the joke was over at that point. 
[03:11:00]  Because Jimmy had pulled around back on in the back door.  And he was hiding in the closet.  And he came out with a shotgun going, you son of a bitch.  What are you doing in this room with my wife?  But it didn't pan out as well.  Because they were actually hoping I would have taken my clothes off and jumped into bed with his wife.  So the gag would have really been funny.  Well, the gag probably wouldn't have happened.  He would have watched you fuck her and whacked her.  He could have jerked off.  Nice peyote.  And done that.  A lot of peyote in that freaking ranch.  Shipped in the bed with your fingers in his wife.  Oh, would have been great. 
[03:11:30]  Patty was pretty cute, actually.  I was very tempted.  You sound like you were gritting it, yeah.  I could have.  I could have actually shot Jimmy and fucked his wife anyway and killed her and then left.  They'd have thought it was a murder-suicide.  Horse story.  Horse story.  Horse.  Jimmy Jackson also used to haul away dead horses.  It was these stables were all over the place.  A lot of kids had horses and people had horses.  And sometimes the horses would die and the kid would be, ah.  And Jimmy would go there and go, don't worry.  We're taking a nice grave site and everything. 
[03:12:00]  And what Jimmy would do was take these horses to a gully on his property and just dump it  to where the rent string, when I used to take the rent horses up, they would start rearing  up and going, brr, brr, brr, when you got close to this area.  Because there's nothing but these decomposing horse carcasses, like three layers deep.  And you're paying.  It was a holocaust of horses.  And you're paying top dollar to have Jimmy Jackson take care of your horse.  Take your horse away.  It's going to be a nice grave on the top of a hill with a little cross.  And this horse.  On a pile of rocks or something.  Instead of just throwing it up. 
[03:12:30]  And then he grew up on Spahn Ranch.  Right.  It was just an awful place.  I had a blast, though.  So Jimmy was hauling away a dead horse and he pulls it in front of his trailer to go in  to take a piss or something like that.  And there was a guy there that wanted to buy a horse.  And Jimmy starts telling him, he goes, I got this great horse.  It's in the trailer.  He goes, but it is so out of control.  It's like an unbroken that we had to give it some kind of sedative.  It's in the trailer right here.  And the guy's like, wow, it's a nice looking horse. 
[03:13:00]  He goes, but it's really crazy.  So my father got in the trailer and started kicking the trailer.  And Jimmy's like, oh, shit, he's waking up.  He's waking up.  So he had this needle and he like pokes the needle in the horse's nose.  And he's like, all right, calm down.  And the guy's like, wow, that horse is really dead.  Like it was dead.  Stone fucking dead.  And this guy was ready to buy a dead fucking horse from Jimmy Jackson.  Because he just loved the way it looks.  Because he looked over the top of the trailer.  And Jimmy's petting it, kind of holding its head down and putting his hand over that crusty, glazed over dead horse eye. 
[03:13:30]  And going, yeah, because if you hide his eyesight, he doesn't get as jumpy.  And he stuck a needle in him.  And he's like, all right, calm down, boy.  Calm down.  And the guy goes, that's a pretty horse.  How much do you want for him?  I don't want to go out on a limb here, but I think Jimmy Jackson was a dick.  Jimmy Jackson was one of the funniest motherfuckers and best character.  He was also, I swear to you, one of the most racist guys I've ever known in my life. 
[03:14:00]  We don't believe that.  He fucking hated black people.  Hated them.  And he used to, he had a kid named Rusty and a daughter named Shiloh.  And Shiloh had to be maybe two years old.  And when he wanted to discipline her, he would say, uh-oh, Shiloh.  I see it.  You're turning into a, and he would say the N word, of course.  And she would start crying and, and with a little girl voice go, I don't want to be a Nigu. 
[03:14:30]  I don't want to be.  And that's how he would, he would.  And you made that your ringtone.  But here's the thing.  It was, you say he was racist.  Yeah.  Her natural instinct as a two-year-old was to cry and say, don't let me be this.  She did not want to be one.  She's just calling.  It was maybe being raised for two years around this guy.  Anytime, like we had a lot of Marines from Camp Pendleton would come up to rent horses on the weekend. 
[03:15:00]  They want to, you know, be cowboys for the weekend.  And I would take them up into the hills.  When black guys would come up, Jimmy would put them on the worst horses that he ever had.  Either ones that were not trained, where they would buck and rear up and just throw these guys off of them.  Or give them the worst, way-backed, ready-to-die horse that couldn't keep up with the rest of the guys.  He was awful.  You go, you should see the horse I gave them, Dick.  Okay, Jimmy. 
[03:15:30]  All right, Jimmy.  Is he dead or alive?  I think he's still alive.  He lives in Lake Elsinore out there, I think.  But I'd love to give him a call and see what he's doing.  But he's probably an old guy now.  You know, he was in his maybe early 30s back then, full of piss and vinegar.  Just like a real character.  His brother-in-law, who was Patty's, the woman Patty's brother, was this big fat guy.  And we were bull riding one day when we kind of got good at it.  And you'd strap the thing on, put one hand on, and hold on with one hand. 
[03:16:00]  They'd open the gate, and you've got to stay on for eight seconds.  So this guy was drunk off his ass.  Big fat guy.  Gets on, holds on to the bull's horns, and goes, I don't need no strap.  Open the gate.  The gate opens, and the first thing the bull did was put his head flat down where his nose almost touched the ground.  And he's holding on to the horns and flew forward about 10 feet, landed on the ground unconscious.  And the bull proceeded to just ragdoll him, throw him around with his horns.  So what did we all do? 
[03:16:30]  Look at him.  He can't get out of the arena.  It was a bunch of drunks, popping peyote, doing nothing but drinking, riding horses, and trying to fuck whatever, like, moved.  And killing Sharon Tate.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Very good.  Great childhood, I've got to tell you.  We got more on the spanking guy.  That creep?  Yeah.  We went a little off-road in there, and we're back on the highway.  He's making the spanking kits. 
[03:17:00]  Suggested punishment guidelines.  One swat for disrespect.  Two swats for cursing.  Three swats for cheating, lying, and direct defiance.  Four swats for stealing.  And five swats for endangering someone's safety, taking drugs, smoking, and drinking.  And six swats for telling.  And then he has a section.  I think this is on his website, which is spare-rods.com. 
[03:17:30]  Rods.  Oh, come on.  Is that his website, really?  Yeah.  Calibrating your paddle.  Before applying paddle to a child, you should determine the force of your swing.  There is only one way to measure it effectively.  Swat yourself on the rump and adjust your swing appropriately.  Have we ordered one of these yet?  Swat yourself on the rump.  Wipe the cum off your leg.  More importantly, we should just get the guy on the show.  Get the guy on the bed.  Because, I mean, to order the paddle is...  It's a paddle.  It's a fucking paddle.  It's just a dump.  Get him on the phone. 
[03:18:00]  Let's get him on the phone, though.  Yep.  Swats.  Huh?  Swats in the ass.  It's a nice man.  For maximum effect, have the child tell you the reason they are being punished.  Paddle Thursday.  Ooh.  Nah, paddle Thursday is too busy.  Shut up, cat noise.  Paddle Friday.  Exactly.  Cat noise Wednesday.  Cat noise is Wednesday.  How about if you have a paddle and hit a cat with a paddle on Wednesday?  Hey, by the way...  Combine the two.  I had Roland come in because I wanted him to do a cat noise.  They just teased the video of the day, by the way, too.  They stopped the video right when the car was about to hit the... 
[03:18:30]  There was fucking media.  All right.  Oh, Roland.  All right.  Cat noise Tuesday.  Go.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  That was good.  No acting.  That's how he is.  You know that by now.  Wait.  It's fucking...  How about a happy cat?  Meow.  That's more cat if it was...  That's a cat with his arms raised into...  Yeah.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow. 
[03:19:00]  That's...  Meow.  That's your cat when the mean kids from the Brat Pack stole it in Hollywood in your childhood.  How about an angry cat?  Meow.  Jimmy, do your angry cat.  Please.  Please.  That's angry.  That's angry cat.  That's Jewish cat.  Wow.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  I don't like the sheen bouncing off your head. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  You're really shiny today.  What's up?  It's awful.  I don't like his pants.  He's caramelized.  He doesn't know that they actually have sizes in pants.  He just buys a long pair of pants.  He judges by color.  All right.  That's all we're going to get out of rolling today.  Wow.  We're going to get a bomb in a row.  All right.  How did I get no car crash?  I had two bombs. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, sorry.  I was watching the Maury Povich figured out another gimmick for his show.  I told you, Maury.  He just gets clips from YouTube.  I told you, Maury.  You are not the father.  Oh, damn.  I told you.  Damn.  More importantly, someone's got to tell Maury he reached that age where you can't  dye your hair anymore.  I was absolutely...  Is that it?  There are old dudes you could get away with dyeing your hair and then something happens.  You hit that age where you just can't do that anymore.  Will I? 
[03:20:30]  He looks creepy, right?  McCartney's starting to look like Janet Reno.  And he looks fucking creepy.  I mean, it's dark brown.  The guy's got to be 70.  If they're older...  So now he's just taking YouTube videos and putting them on his show.  Oh, my God.  And that's his show.  Yeah, catfights are always...  Nice.  Catfight...  Catfight.  I love the catfight videos.  Catfight noise Thursday.  Wow.  She is pulling her hair.  It's got...  Oh, and then...  Oh, another girl came in for the tackle. 
[03:21:00]  Nice.  Nice side tackle.  You know, you can't beat these cell phone cams.  They really are.  They just...  Oh, and then she takes out her knife.  That knife is a little dangerous.  Because we all carry knives and...  What far away land is this?  It's Brazil.  Is it Brazil?  It's got to be Brazil.  And then she cuts the straps off her shoes.  Why are people applauding?  I love the applauding part.  That's a big insult in Brazil to cut the straps off your shoes.  Is it?  Yeah, that's equal to stealing someone's avocado.  That's actually...  Yeah, Maury's hair looks good.  Wow, that does look a little weird.  I want to look at fucking retarded Chappelle over there on Channel 5. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, my God.  All right, so for maximum effect, you have the child tell you the reason they're being punished.  Parents should wait one minute before each SWAT.  One minute before each SWAT.  So wait a minute.  You get one SWAT and then wait a minute.  This is...  This guy...  For the next one, that's torture.  He's sick.  That is like torture.  Apply no more than five SWATs per day.  We got to get this guy on the phone.  Can we get him on immediately?  Let's try to get him on immediately.  Spank only on the rump. 
[03:22:00]  Child must be wearing clothes.  Use force sufficient only to get the child's attention.  Oh, fun.  Support child's torso so no stress can be placed on their spine.  Support their torso with what?  Put the handle in the front.  Stop.  I actually had an autograph by Jimmy Jackson.  After punishment is served, give your child a hug and tell them that you love them.  Oh, that's good.  Make that connection.  And then tell them that's your cell phone in your pocket.  And then kiss him on the neck.  Spankings equals love. 
[03:22:30]  That's stupid.  The punishment was for their behavior only.  And look, Dr. Keith has Raised by a Racist on today.  I know.  That's nice.  Could be my, I should be, I should be on this show.  Jimmy Jackson.  Your kid should be.  Hey!  I'm so tolerant, it's ridiculous when compared to the likes of Jimmy Jackson and my family  that I grew up with.  Well, Jimmy Jackson said he scared his daughter with the idea of the boogeyman. 
[03:23:00]  He absolutely did.  I don't want to be.  And the kid would cry.  She was like, she was like milk white and curly blonde hair, like a little Aryan kid.  Yeah.  And she would just cry and cry that she did not want to be one.  And today she'll probably be sitting in the car next to Patrice driving up to the gig this weekend.  Showing her dad a thing or two.  Hey, daddy, I'm bringing my boyfriend home.  Oh, shit.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey. 
[03:23:30]  Mike.  Oh, and hey, what's up, buddy?  Hey, man.  Hey, Pepperoni Nipples.  How are you?  I appreciate that type of reference.  A few people.  Why did you answer that?  Because he had to meet me.  Really?  That's my code name.  Oh.  When I have secret operations to perform.  Pepperoni Nipples.  Code name, Pepperoni Nipples.  Mike, go ahead.  Yeah, I got my cat throwing up noise.  Okay. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  All right.  That was it, Jimmy.  He's failing miserably.  You got to acknowledge it at this point.  Hair balls are more like this.  I think just the other.  And then they go.  Hey.  Very good news for the fans.  Yes.  Paul O.  Some people said, stop saying Paul O.  But Paul O kisses Twato at 11 o'clock or sometime after 11 on XM. 
[03:24:30]  Wow.  What a treat.  Yeah.  A little treat for everybody.  And O.  I think you're wrong.  I think just the opposite.  I think that Cat Noise Wednesday is a massive hit.  Nope.  And they can't get enough.  It's going to be replaced by Dog Noise Thursday.  No, that's.  Colin.  Yeah.  I hate it.  I hate it.  I don't want phone call to Thursday either.  I want to whittle these.  I want to go on Thursday.  Sounds interesting.  What does that entail?  It's just.  All right.  You guys.  Hey, more bitter Colin Quinn doesn't understand what's going on in entertainment. 
[03:25:00]  What's going on?  I'm working on a bit with you, bro.  What goes on for a phone call Thursday?  We take a lot more phone calls than we do on Wednesday.  But I don't think we do.  Also called calling it in Thursday, if you know what I mean.  Let the listeners do all the lifting for us.  Bitter Colin Quinn doesn't understand entertainment.  What's going on out there these days?  It's really unbelievable.  What else have you seen out there? 
[03:25:30]  Well.  Evan Almighty.  Evan Almighty is really.  That's a winner.  All the Owen Wilson trilogy I enjoy.  Oh, you like that.  Yeah.  Because he had the worst hair.  I love the way they had to fucking spray his hair down.  So you can't see that he probably looks like fucking Alan Arkin without hair.  Spray it to his eyebrow.  Once in a while you'll see an angle and you're like, that cocksucker, his fucking forehead  goes to the middle of his skin.  It's great.  I was watching ATJ last week and then I repeat, according to Jim, and it was an episode with 
[03:26:00]  the hamster.  He brought a hamster and the family didn't believe the hamster was really there, you know.  And then at the end, so anyway, there's a long story short.  But the hamster wakes up Jim who's sleeping on the couch like a wacky dad.  Oh.  It wakes him up and saves the house from a fire.  Oh, wow.  And then they all ran out and they still didn't believe it.  They go, dad, there's no hamster.  He jumps out the window and he saves it.  Oh.  So it was like a serious.  Was that a special, very special episode of?  I think it might have been Peter related or something. 
[03:26:30]  Wow.  The hamster helped.  Yeah.  All right.  Cool.  Is there any show on?  You know, I actually saw Elaine from Seinfeld there and her show is still on.  New Adventures of a Cold of Christine.  It's still on.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  I was like, wait, this show is still on?  She's got a show?  Thank you so much for the Seinfeld curse, right?  Well, they actually had on.  Is that what the British butler?  They're cursed with riches.  First of all, let's not pretend Norton wouldn't do a guest spot on there.  Now go ahead and say what you want. 
[03:27:00]  I certainly would.  Is that the one with the British butler that we teased?  Wow.  When it first came out, we played audio of it.  I think so, right?  No, no.  She has no butler.  Oh, is that the one from the second one?  She's a single mom.  She's a single mom.  She's still in touch with her husband.  She has a kid.  Her kid's like a smart kid.  That was Stan's bit.  He would bring lines in, funny lines in from these sitcoms, and we would play them and just  they'd be so bad.  And I predict season three, there's a plot. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, I met a guy online dating, and this sellout shows up.  Hi, Christine.  I'm the crazy guy from online dating.  No, I'm...  Shut up and let them laugh, stupid.  That was a good one, Jimmy.  It really was.  I don't disagree.  It was really good.  I don't disagree.  We're not asking you to disagree.  We're asking you to shut up and let us all savor your awfulness.  You know what I say?  Meow.  Meow.  If it was any other day than Wednesday, I'd be pissed, but he's right.  Well, you know what?  The guys are forcing my hand, and I'm going to have to declare that Monday through Friday, 
[03:28:00]  it's a cat noise melee.  No.  It's a melee of cat noises.  Okay, I didn't want to say this today, but I'm going to say it.  All right.  I want you two to finally stand up and fire this fool.  No.  It has to happen.  It goes all...  Shut up and let me finish.  No.  It's all over comedy.  No.  You're not going to be polite.  Well, you give probably a good case for my firing. 
[03:28:30]  All right.  The creep's not answering his phone.  The spanking hits.  Maury is now doing a recreation of some kind of abduction rape thing.  Yeah.  Wow.  He's like, look at this titillating, horrible little thing they're showing.  I don't want to be good if Maury comes with his dying hair right there.  He's got the knife.  Why don't you spread them?  Yeah.  Maury, you're a beautiful girl, no matter what people say.  She was working the handcuffs sexy.  Did you see that?  Yep.  It kind of reminded me of Anthony and the Mexican when he was 12. 
[03:29:00]  Yes.  Maury's me.  Maury's me.  Damn dad cock blocking me.  Barely closed and completely hysterical.  The victim ran a den of torture and made it to the authority.  Den of torture.  This woman's violent, torturous ordeal finally came to an end.  But her life would never be the same.  As for the Fishers, kidnapping, false imprisonment, and sexual assault are just a few of the charges.  Oh, that looks like Jimmy Jackson.  Jimmy Jackson. 
[03:29:30]  Time behind bars for dead old-finding crimes.  Oh, boy.  Smokers.  Yeah.  Woo, yeah.  Applauded.  That guy looks like Voss when he's 60.  Five years.  Initially, when she disappeared, her mom called the police.  So the police were looking around.  She's awful.  He's got conclamation, this guy.  Blah, blah, blah.  We'll take a break and we'll wrap up this mess next.  All right.  Don't forget, sometime after 11, we got Paul O. licking Twatto for everybody.  Yes.  In case you haven't heard that yet.  That's disgusting.  All right.  Tomorrow, by the way. 
[03:30:00]  What?  Tomorrow is Cat Noise Thursday.  Oh, no.  It's Cat Noise Thursday.  Don't break our feet.  Fire him.  Fire him.  It's Cat Noise Thursday.  Fire him.  No.  You're fire.  You can only do cat noises for tomorrow.  You're fire.  You have to sing the Meow Mix song.  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.  That's tomorrow.  Everyone knows it.  They sure do.  Something's sticking your head with me like it or not.  I like liver.  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, please deliver. 
[03:30:30]  Of course, he's the only one that knows the actual words.  We just know the Meow.  Come off the powers.  He knows the extended remix.  It's the OPN Disney Show.  All right, let's get some plugs in because we're getting ready for the line of the day. 
[03:31:00]  Colin Quinn, he's going to be at Caroline's here in New York City all weekend long.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-100.  Off the top of my head.  That's pretty good.  Thanks, Hope.  All right.  Colin Quinn, of course, a very funny guy. 
[03:31:30]  We love when he's on the show.  He hasn't been here in, I don't know, a year.  Over a year.  What the hell's going on with you?  A long time.  We're all wondering what the hell's going on with you.  I'll tell you what's going on.  I've been miserable and depressed as well.  Why, Colin?  Oh, Colin.  I've been depressed.  Why?  What's going on?  Why are you depressed?  What do you want me to say?  Hey, guys, I've just been busy.  No, I've been not busy and depressed.  We're asking you why.  Yeah, why?  We're your friends.  Why don't you watch TV?  Oh, Peter Colin Quinn doesn't understand the entertainment business.  You mean because you're, well, so what?  Do you have a little downtime?  A little? 
[03:32:00]  First of all.  God damn.  How deep does this rollercoaster go?  Does it crash at the bottom?  That is true.  Wow.  Come on, Bob.  This lunatic walked in, smashing me in the face.  He deserves it.  We do need a deep seat.  Caroline's all weekend.  Pat's how he's going to be there.  We do need a deep seat diving belt to see the bottom of this valley.  Oh, God.  I wanted to go out and do some gigs with Colin.  It never happened.  No, he kind of, but first of all, wait a minute.  If you want to get, if you want to be honest about a phony, let's talk about Norton. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah.  You are a liar.  You said you wanted to do, shut up and let me tell the true story.  Yeah.  He goes to me, hey, man, we should do some gigs together.  They go, yeah, let's do it.  And I could tell he was like panicking, like, uh-oh, I'm not going to do this.  There goes some of my money.  All you want to do is beef.  You want to think of yourself as a guy that wants to go do gigs with me.  No, I do actually.  Shut up, liar.  I hope he said it.  He went, uh-oh, there goes some of my money.  Exactly.  I know how you do it.  Norton's a skin flint and everyone knows it.  I have to be very generous.  No, you're not. 
[03:33:00]  Why else do we get an open mic-er from Pittsburgh before Jim Norton or Bob Kelly or Colin Quinn?  Thank you.  I know the deal.  He's a tightwad.  Colin wants a lot of money.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, he does.  Do you, Colin?  Yes.  Bob, what did you say?  I said, yeah, you want a lot of money.  I mean, you're worth half of what you want.  Oh, I swear to God.  I really had it this time.  There's a window right behind you.  Take care of business.  There should be a window in the back of your car so you can lean your head out. 
[03:33:30]  What?  It was a dog reference.  It was a horse reference.  All right, that's Friday.  Why don't you go get your shoes nailed?  That was a good one.  That was a fantastic one.  Shoes nailed.  Someone's been watching the Discovery Channel and History Channel for a year.  I'm playing right.  That's where horses are on, Discovery and the History Channel.  Don't put dirty jobs.  Oh, boy.  Still in the old days.  You're losing, Bob.  You're losing.  I'm the referee.  Come on.  Come on. 
[03:34:00]  Punch your way out of the corner.  I know you can do it.  Yeah, take that wax candle you call a head and get out of here.  Yeah, you've got to end the show on a high note, though.  Oh, man.  Nobody.  Oh, holy shit.  He really has a lot of hatred in him.  He comes back quick.  Yeah.  So why the depression?  You all right there, Colin?  That's what I hear.  Colin just hangs out in his house.  Yeah, why?  You screwed me.  You did, right?  On the deals.  Oh, look at the girls' tits. 
[03:34:30]  They're huge.  Those are the biggest things I've ever seen.  Look at them.  Those are giants.  They're 42 long.  Actually, she's off the website, monstrouspig.com.  Steve's fat gay forearm keeps blocking the tits.  He reminds your unshaven arm and moving it so I can see tits.  He shaves his arm, though.  Yeah, he does.  Yeah, they are shaved.  He nares his arm.  That's all he does is shave all day long.  Steve. 
[03:35:00]  He has to wake up two hours early to shave.  It's the shave his forearm.  I know why we didn't.  Oh, what happened?  Why Colin and I didn't do the issue.  Oh, why?  Actually, you know why.  Honestly, because we wanted to do Buffalo because I was warming up for the special,  so I was doing only weeks in comedy clubs and not theaters.  So we were going to do theaters together.  We can't just do comedy clubs together.  Are you sure it's not because you blew up and started doing these giant hour specials?  Oh, boy.  I was doing comedy clubs.  I was doing like seven shows a week in comedy clubs to get ready for it. 
[03:35:30]  Don't.  You're not answering my question.  It's going to be real now.  A little real.  Yeah.  No, he's asking me, but it's no.  Shut up, you chisel.  I haven't done a theater in a long time.  Quiet, you tightwad.  Don't get mad.  You skinplint.  Stop getting mad.  He blew up and you deflated.  Oh.  Wish that you could do this.  Dude.  You're pretty much setting him up.  Everything you say is a small ball.  Everything's a set up for him.  I know.  I understand that.  Even if I lost weight and had abs, they'd still do fat.  Oh, well.  Do you understand that? 
[03:36:00]  Why don't we try that out?  What do you mean even if I lost weight and had abs?  Colin.  That's your excuse for not getting on an exercise bike.  It still makes fun of me.  Why bother?  You don't know how real that is.  That's actually been brought up in therapy.  Could you imagine these guys going, look at Bob's beautiful, well-formed body.  Yeah.  Wow.  He's an adonis.  He'd be like, it wasn't worth it.  God, they're still fucking with me here.  I still have the gym. 
[03:36:30]  That's all right.  You have the gym?  Jimmy swim walks.  I know.  But Jimmy doesn't get made in front of his body.  He gets made in front of what he is.  Skin flicked.  Hey, back to the skin flicked thing.  Was I not generous with you when you came down to film me?  You were generous.  Thank you.  Jimmy's one big stretch mark.  No, I don't have any action.  There you go.  Grabbing his cock.  Jeez, you guys.  All right.  Yeah, I heard.  That's all I heard, though.  It's like, what's Colin doing these days?  When we'd ask, what's Colin doing?  He just locks himself in his apartment and doesn't come out. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah, well, that sounds pretty accurate.  I could just see you watching TV going, what's this fucking shit?  Look at this crap.  Look, it's all fine.  The only part that's bothering me, just now Jim said, if I call you to hang out, the only  thing I mind is the phoniness.  But it's not.  And Jimmy is being a liar and a phony right now.  Wow.  Now, admit that you're as heartless and cold and cow.  Even your old girlfriend told me, hey, I tried to get Colin and Jimmy to call you and  hang out, but he doesn't do it. 
[03:37:30]  Stop pretending you have a heart.  He's the only one about all my friends that didn't come by and see me.  I was away.  When I was on.  Wow.  Whoa.  The only one.  I was away.  The only one that didn't know you weren't, because you called me and said you were coming  by tomorrow.  Oh.  A little boy waiting for daddy.  Colin actually picked me up at the actual hospital.  Yeah.  What, a forklift?  Even I showed up.  What?  Oh, but you didn't even text message me.  I showed up.  You didn't hear that one.  I heard that.  I showed up, though.  Where did you show up?  I never got the, I left the message with the doorman. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, my doorman in my new apartment that I moved to that I don't have a doorman.  Oh, boy.  Sitting on the front step with a bottle.  Oh, boy.  My doorman.  Oh, man.  Jesus.  Oh, I haven't been to your new place.  I have.  I have an old place.  Yeah.  Norton's been.  All right.  Listen.  He liked my place, right?  So you're cool with Jimmy?  Yeah.  Yes, he is.  You are?  Well, because the forklift joke was funny, so.  It's all fake.  Come on.  I swear to God, everything I say is set up for a fat joke. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah.  Anytime your name comes up, Colin, Jimmy's the first one to say Colin is one of the best  comics he's seen.  Sure, because that doesn't cost him anything.  That doesn't cost him anything.  That's why.  Oh, the second it runs into cost that.  Well, Jimmy's got a girlfriend now, too, though.  With the gigs, Colin, I do.  I would say we would probably split the money.  What gigs we do?  We do gigs.  We would split the money.  There's no gigs.  Does Colin demand more money than you're getting?  Of course not.  I don't.  Because that would be crazy.  I actually don't know.  We're talking about the gigs that never materialize. 
[03:39:00]  Which they were all made up.  But if they did, you guys are making about the same money.  Now your people are tough.  He's making it all up, you guys.  No, his agent.  Your agent.  To stand up for Jimmy right now, your agent, your old one.  I don't know about you knowing him, but your old one did.  From a year ago?  Not even a year ago.  Fucked up a lot of gigs.  We had that theater gig ready to go.  And your agent's one gig one more time, you guys.  That's the way he's obsessed.  Why don't you mind your business and shut up?  A thousand dollars, fatso, and I won't.  Quiet. 
[03:39:30]  Your stupid agent denied it, and you didn't even fucking say no to it.  Did a fatso call another guy?  Another fatso.  That's really what he said.  What's going on here?  If we were tummy to tummy, our tits wouldn't touch.  If we were tummy to tummy, you wouldn't be able to see each other.  All right.  Can we get out of here, his friend?  I suggested it.  It was my suggestion.  I said to Pete, like, I would love to do some gigs with Colin.  He called your guys.  They didn't call him back or whatever.  But then they finally talked. 
[03:40:00]  It's obviously your fault, Colin.  All right.  It doesn't happen.  No, no, no.  I see.  Then they talked.  Then they talked.  We were going to do Buffalo again.  I believe Colin now.  I think she ain't talking too much.  Of course.  You know I'm telling you.  Well, if we didn't have the comedy tour at Mohegan this weekend, I would be going to  see Colin Quinn at Caroline's.  Good point.  How can't you go tomorrow?  Starting tomorrow.  We're leaving tomorrow.  We're leaving tomorrow.  Oh, fuck, man.  It's a full-time gig.  Tomorrow.  Because first of all, I love Caroline's, and I love Colin Quinn.  Thank you.  He's very funny. 
[03:40:30]  I actually got a lot of emails from West Palm.  A lot of people saw you over there, Colin.  They said you were amazing.  Well, thank you, Robert.  Me and Robert were down in Florida together.  He was in Miami.  Yeah, but I didn't like the way you just accepted that compliment, like a fucking-  Of course, he's telling the truth.  I'm like those Buffalo shows.  Look at him.  They'll be known.  Look at him.  He needs all the compliments he can get.  Just let him have one.  But how he just took that awful, like, hey, I heard you were terrific the other night.  Right.  Thanks, Bob.  Shut up.  No.  I was just saying that the old man did a good job in Orlando. 
[03:41:00]  All right.  And a couple people, one person.  I'm sure he was terrific.  How about we end with a butt rub?  A butt rub.  I'll do it.  Well, Jimmy's the king of the butt rub.  It is butt rub Wednesday.  We've got to end butt rub Wednesday.  I would love to see-  Oh, Sam's coming over.  I guess he wants a butt rub.  No.  No.  No.  Young Sam.  No.  Colin and Norm do a butt rub.  No.  I'm not rubbing my fucking ass on those awful-  His fucking-  No.  His ass cheeks look like Thirsten Howell III's face. 
[03:41:30]  He's just old and jowly.  He does.  That was a nice call.  His ass looks like the scream mask.  Oh, boy.  That was a good one.  That is good.  I want to do it with Sam.  All right.  Let's end the show quick.  Bob?  Butt rub with Jimmy?  Oh.  Don't give me the compassionate frown-  I'm just asking.  The frown of the brow frown.  I'm just asking.  I don't think-  No.  When you get cute, I get scared. 
[03:42:00]  I'm just asking.  Okay?  When you get cute, I get scared.  I didn't know you found me to be cute.  Thank you.  You're very cute.  You're the cutest guy in the room always.  I'll do one with you if you want to.  Yeah.  No.  I can't.  Why?  You have to.  It's a butt rub.  That's a butt rub.  Yeah.  It's also my-  It's your butt.  Oh, my butt.  Yeah.  It's just cheeks, though.  It's just a few seconds of warmness.  It's not a butthole.  It's cheek.  Yeah.  It's cheek.  You just kind of, you know, cheek to cheek.  There we go.  Oh, God.  All right.  He just wants to get this over with. 
[03:42:30]  What the fuck?  You're wearing fucking comic-  What the fuck are you wearing?  Comics?  Wait.  What are your-  Wait.  What kind of-  Comic book undies that he's wearing.  What kind of comic book is on your underpants?  All right.  Hold on.  He ain't.  Oh, jeez.  What's hanging out of your ass all the time?  He just-  He just-  He just whipped your ass with his cock.  And what the hell was hanging out?  What was hanging out of your ass?  What the hell?  Or was that the tag on your underwear? 
[03:43:00]  There was tape or something.  What was that?  What brand of pants do you wear?  He slapped your cheek with my helmet.  He slapped his dick with my ass.  He slapped his fucking cock all over your ass.  He dick whipped him.  That was so gay.  He dick whipped him.  He's not even gay.  That's the beautiful part.  We're gay.  We're not even watching that.  What the hell?  Yeah, it's gay.  Get on mic, Bob.  A cock hitting somebody in the ass is not gay?  Bob, get on mic.  Get on mic.  What is it?  Heterosexual?  It's not.  It's not.  It's fine.  You all right with that?  What?  His ass? 
[03:43:30]  What am I going to do, dude?  What am I going to do?  I almost did it to your head before Bob was laying there.  Can I just say something though?  I'm almost disappointed that Bob was laying there.  Bob was laying there and his head was there and I was like, I got to slap my cock on the  top of Bob's head.  Nothing would be better.  I know.  I saw you were going to do that.  The only reason I didn't is because I don't know if Rene was in there before.  I'm like, I can't do that.  I was thinking.  You were looking over there.  That was why.  I was like, I could be a responsible broadcaster.  I mean, I'll be silly, but I'm not going to slap my dick on someone with a chicken in  the room. 
[03:44:00]  You'd slap your dick on your friend's forehead.  Oh, dude.  But if a girl's in the room.  It would have been.  I know.  I was looking and actually, I was helping out because I was keeping you occupied in a  conversation.  Do you understand?  You know why he would want to do it to me instead of calling?  Because he knows I wouldn't try to suck it.  That's not why.  Why would you call him up?  What?  You know Quinn.  No, I don't know what you're saying.  You know, Robin, I don't know what you're saying.  I'm saying the, well, you're ruining the show at the end of the fucking show. 
[03:44:30]  That's all I say.  I'm getting mad.  Shut up and take your abuse, you cocksucker.  That's what your comic book undies.  Yeah, what's that?  They really are awful.  What comic book are they?  I don't know.  You do know.  I really don't.  You don't know.  All right, let's pull him down.  How did you get them?  Jesus Christ.  He knows comic books.  I don't know comic books.  I do.  Jimmy does.  I saw the Hulk.  I know you fucking pennies.  You don't know comic books.  You got Hulk underpants on.  I do so.  You got underoos.  You're wearing underoos.  X-Men 94 was the one with the new X-Men.  Yeah, see?  Jimmy knows.  See, Hulk.  He's got Hulk, the green lantern. 
[03:45:00]  It's funny if I took these off a kid that I just molested.  Jesus.  The big fucking kid.  A kid?  I mean a goat?  And then his pants.  I never heard of them.  What brand are those?  It's called the Gap, you fucking fool.  No, on the tag on the back.  I didn't know if that was...  It's a Gap.  There's a Gap.  The brand of how much you had to weigh to get into them.  I'm going to have to get my pants off of eBay from 1978.  You and your acid wash.  I want to see what kind of...  Acid wash is coming back, Bob. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, it is.  That's a Gap shot.  20 years later.  Why are you standing with confidence now?  I don't know.  I'm still standing.  I have a knee brace on.  It gives me confidence.  Sweetie.  Nick the road warrior.  I want to see the underwear with the cartoons on them.  I know you do.  Or just tell me what they are.  I don't have to see it.  You probably want to jerk off on them, too.  No, no.  I'm not attracted to you, but I just want to see the...  What?  What do you mean you're not attracted to me?  Let me see.  Oh, wow.  Wham.  I can't see anything but a couple of bad lines.  I'll show you.  I'll show you.  You want to see my undies?  Lift it up.  It's the Hulk banished for outer space. 
[03:46:00]  It's just like...  It's an old Hulk.  All right, deadliest catch.  Move back with the camera.  I know.  I want to go noodling and Bob's crack.  All right.  Let's do some lines of the day.  Some runner-ups and all the rest.  Don't put my cock on your side, Sam.  A little less depressed now that you came back on our show?  Yes.  Yeah?  Big comeback.  We should have Colin back more.  Colin, I want to come on.  You should really come on here a lot.  Stop.  That's what Jimmy tells us. 
[03:46:30]  Especially when you've got gigs.  Jimmy tells us you have no interest to be on our show.  But even if you're not plugging a gig, come on in.  And then when you're plugging gigs, we have what they call put the S's in the seat.  But Jimmy says no interest from you.  No, no.  I didn't say that.  Let me give you my...  Here's my confidence with Colin.  Colin, how come you don't come on anymore?  Shut your mouth.  Yeah.  That is pretty much waiting.  I was trying to talk to him about doing a show on Saturday nights for X7.  I couldn't get anywhere with him.  So maybe it's how you, like, negotiate.  But I mean, I'm like, dude, how come you haven't been around? 
[03:47:00]  Shut your mouth, you phony.  It's true.  And then it's the end of the conversation, and you're trying to get real stuff done.  I was trying to get real stuff done in the hallway.  I'm like, oh, forget it.  I just gave up.  He shoved me over to Danny.  Right.  I was like, I don't know when he's joking, when he's serious, when he's depressed, when  he's happy.  Well, let's face it.  It wasn't exactly the best offer ever.  It was like, hey, we have no money.  Yeah, that's the first thing I heard.  We don't have money.  How'd you like to do one hour once a month on Saturday?  Yeah.  For one night, I can make money. 
[03:47:30]  That's good.  Yeah, we don't even have that figured out, because we have all the comedians doing shows  on Saturday when they're supposed to be out doing gigs for real money.  So we should do that during the week, is what we should do.  You want to do what you guys do?  You should pre-tape it.  Wednesday nights.  Oh.  Ooh.  Pre-tape.  Hi, Deck.  And then run it.  How do you do a phone call Thursday?  Meow.  Just make a cat noise.  All right, let's go.  Runner-up line of the day.  Ooh.  All right.  Hit it.  We got to do what the hell is that.  We love a boy outfit alone. 
[03:48:00]  Steve's working for the weekend.  Colin, runner-up line of the day.  Huh?  Woo.  What do you get for that?  I don't know.  I would hope that would be a two-pronged, I was hoping it would be a two-pronged runner-up right there.  Why?  Because the line right after it was very funny.  Yeah, but we're trying to make Colin.  Yeah, but it could have been like a co-  They're trying to put me in a good mood.  Hey, hey, Ixnay, we all knew that, but we all also knew that.  We were trying to lift him up today. 
[03:48:30]  The next line was, because he doesn't work during the week.  I know.  Like, Jimmy threw that out there, mocking the fact that Steve is a lazy bum.  But Jimmy sees what's going on here.  That's why he kept quiet.  Yeah, I forgot I said that.  I was robbed.  All right, here's another runner-up line of the day.  Jeff, what's going on?  Hey, boys, how are you doing?  Good.  All right, Bob, I always think I'll report you breakfast on Wednesday, Newark Airport.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, thank you, buddy.  How are you doing, man? 
[03:49:00]  Good, buddy.  Did your credit card company call up and think it was stolen?  See, there you go, Jimmy.  See, Jimmy still gets one.  Nah, that's funny.  Jimmy still gets one, and Colin still feels good about himself.  Everything's good right now.  And I'm still a hunk of shit.  Fucking Opie.  You might be getting a line of the day.  He was implying that you ate so much that even if put on a credit card, that the credit  card company would say, oh, my God, this has to be a stolen card.  Dude, what the fuck?  Dude. 
[03:49:30]  Jimmy just farted.  We always had a perfect show, and you had to end it with that shit?  I wouldn't say it was perfect.  Jimmy farted and really stunk it up.  Come on.  I can finish the show for you guys because it's not coming over here.  Hey, next up.  Yeah, actually, Foghat.  It hasn't come.  I'm auditioning for the new station.  Hey, next up.  What station?  All right, listen.  Foghat.  They're looking for DJs.  I'm auditioning for the station.  They pay big money.  Hey, next up, the Stone Roses.  Is this more Bitter Colin Quinn, right? 
[03:50:00]  Yes.  Yeah, I love Bitter Colin Quinn.  Let's develop that.  Next up.  Me and you.  The smithereens.  I see eight episodes.  Bitter Colin Quinn.  No, we'll do it on Saturday night when I'm getting no more one hour.  Then I go, he goes, and I was like, yeah, he goes, my advice is you just start with  one hour.  I just said one or two.  Start with a minute.  Don't throw me under the bus.  I'm the only one trying to help you out here.  Oh, wow.  What, for the three show on the radio?  No, no thanks.  You dick. 
[03:50:30]  Come on.  We're going to beat the shit out of each other after this show ends.  Hey, this is nice.  Kathy Griffin.  I love her.  What about her?  Very funny.  She is very funny.  Like your TV show?  Yeah.  What are you trying to say?  I'll do the E-list.  He goes, have you seen Opie's face?  I like it.  He goes, well.  Tony Montana's sister on Pal Talk here.  Have you seen her?  Hey.  Yeah.  All right.  I don't mind.  Line of the day.  How am I going to get a shot like that from any pussy?  He's a nice man. 
[03:51:00]  Line of the day.  You aren't so fuck me, Tony.  Where did you get this money, Antonio?  The worst of the other play, Paulo?  Oh, yeah.  All right, good.  Don't forget.  Fuck me, Tony.  Fuck me.  Line of the day.  Here.  Yeah.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  A lot of pomp and circumstance goes along with this.  Very important.  Colin put on a few pounds. 
[03:51:30]  Did he, Colin?  I put on a few.  Did he?  Yeah, of course I did, but, like, I'm a person that got fat.  Yeah.  I'm not a person that is fat.  Bob should be, like, you know, throwing a spear at a whale.  Manitoba.  You look at my Aunt Peggy, fatso.  Aunt.  Aunt.  Look at the size of his head.  Look at your head.  At least I have my hair left.  You look like a...  I'd rather have...  You look like the fat mosque in Iraq.  The Sunni insurgent is going to blow up the mosque. 
[03:52:00]  All right.  It was basically that whole interaction.  That whole interaction.  Oh, that's great.  No, no.  I'd give it to Colin.  Wow.  Of course you'd do.  But it was more Colin, the boss, the motherfucker.  If I get a show, you'd give it to me.  Bobby has a good line.  I don't want a show.  Colin's references are so fucking crazy, though.  They're called lonely when he's sitting home watching nothing but 11 hours of television  a day.  What was the best Bob Kelly slam?  It was Colin backstage at the Hard Rock about the last minute gift at a... 
[03:52:30]  Chinese airport.  Oh, God damn.  Was it a...  I don't think he said Chinese.  Yes, he did.  No, it was a...  It was a last minute gift at a Hawaii...  Hong Kong airport.  Hong Kong airport.  The Hong Kong airport.  If you remember my...  It was a Buddha joke, everyone.  But if you remember my slam back, he was wearing a grass skirt, and I said, is that your  Comedy Central contract you're wearing?  That was a good one.  Shredded...  That was a good one.  That led to the depression.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, what the hell was that?  Bob.  I hit a little...  Because that was the last time we saw him.  Bob.  Yeah. 
[03:53:00]  Barbaro.  I think it was Flavor Flav taking over the show.  Yeah, well...  That might have done it.  You white guys scared behind him.  Hey, can we have our show back?  I guess not.  Okay, whatever.  Oh, like you were going to say something.  I left.  That is one of the greatest moments in Opie and Anthony history.  I just saw Norton dancing.  Flavor Flav was supposed to do four minutes tops.  He did a fucking hour-long concert where he introduced every person he ever met in his  life.  I felt like I was on a Zimbabwe farm.  It was all your fans. 
[03:53:30]  It was not one black guy in the crowd.  And he brought his daughter out and they go, show your tits.  Show your tits.  It was like Animal House.  If I were you, I'd be leaving.  What a good idea.  We should have just walked out.  They were rapping and then you guys were in the back and your heads were just bobbing.  The Negroes took our show.  Bob, you are 100% right.  You can kill us.  Yeah, bobbing our heads.  Yeah.  We didn't know what the fuck to do.  We hijacked our show.  All of syndication. 
[03:54:00]  Tom Chiasano's yelling at me backstage.  We got to end this.  I'm like, yeah, why don't you...  Yeah, you get out there and end this.  Why don't you go out there with your stupid tie and suit and end this?  While they were all on stage, Colin leaned over to me and went, looks like the last king  of Scotland.  Yeah, we showed what pussies we were.  I thought it was in a pot with a pith helmet on.  Flavor Flav.  Flavor Flav thought everyone was there to see him. 
[03:54:30]  He thought everyone was there to see him.  He thought it was his show.  He thought it was his record release party.  CD release party, right.  He said, yo, this is my daughter.  This is my other daughter.  This is my son.  This is my other daughter.  This is my son.  He brought out 19 kids.  By the way, it's got to be acknowledged because it's coming in a lot.  Unfinished clone.  Didn't even get a mention today.  A lot of the listeners love it.  That was a good one.  That was a good one.  Yes.  He really does look like the one still in the jelly hanging on the wall. 
[03:55:00]  All right.  Don't push it.  Thank you, Anthony.  Thank you.  We were acknowledging it.  Thank you.  You're right.  You're funny.  Let's leave it at that.  Opie, Anthony, thank you.  Thank you very much for acknowledging me.  Bob, we'll see you at Mohegan Sun Saturday.  Yes.  This one's going to be a great one, though.  We're at the casino.  A lot of fun.  Three card?  Three card.  Three card, as long as you play first, and then let me sit down in your seat.  This motherfucker.  I warmed the seat up for him.  I left, and he hit on a what?  Second card.  Straight flush.  Straight flush.  30 to one, is that it? 
[03:55:30]  Yeah.  Right.  Three of a kind is 40?  No.  40 to one?  Yeah.  No, not three of a kind is less.  Straight flush.  Straight flush is the top dog.  All right.  He did top dog.  Two hands after I left the table.  40 to one.  40 to one.  I think that Opie was drunk because he had this smile like, I'm going to kill you, but  it's okay.  Patrice just openly laughs at the dealers.  When you are hitting, you're playing blackjack, and the dealer's in one of those slumps where  they're just dealing out blackjack and winning hands, Patrice openly points and  laughs at the dealer going, oh, you lost again, you sucker. 
[03:56:00]  Yeah.  That's why there's not going to be an NBA team in Vegas.  That kind of behavior.  And that's why he's...  Colin Quinn, Caroline.  We've been trying to get off the air for 20 minutes.  We actually were going to end early because we've got meetings and we're kind of in bonus  time.  A little bit.  But then again, there was 15 minutes there that was a little shaky with the job.  We'll cut it up.  Yeah.  So we'll cut that part out.  And then we'll look like radio stuff.  Cut out all the cat noises.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Right.  Cat noises have to go.  Every reference to Cat Noise Wednesday, out. 
[03:56:30]  Cat noises are now going to take over.  And Jimmy.  I'm telling you, the meowing has only begun.  Jimmy.  I want people meowing.  All right.  Colin, Caroline.  Thanks.  You'll get the fan.  Good to be back, boys.  The fan support.  When are you coming back?  You name it.  I'm back.  How about in two weeks?  No more depression.  I like that.  Why not?  This is the new Colin Quinn.  No, I like being depressed.  It's down in the dumps.  You're down in the dumps.  The bitter Colin Quinn's a good character, but we don't need you to be depressed.  Have you ever seen a happy, fun Colin Quinn be, like, fun? 
[03:57:00]  Have you ever seen a happy, fun comedian?  No.  No.  Yes?  I constantly talk about how miserable they are.  Give you an idea how stupid Norton is.  He actually is proud.  He did seven shows in Buffalo.  I didn't do any in Buffalo.  I was waiting for you.  Thank God you said that and saved me from my last mom.  Let's get out of here.  You know who you would assume is the happiest comic around?  Who?  Brian Regan, right?  Brian Regan.  He's got dark side.  Fun, like, clean comic.  I will go to my grave with stuff that I have heard and seen from Brian Regan. 
[03:57:30]  Really?  That just is beyond.  And it proves the point that every comic, I don't care who they are or what their act  is like, are just either miserable or fucked up somehow.  Funniest live performer ever?  Jimmy Jackson.  With the bull.  Jimmy Jackson.  Bull and the fat guy.  He's hysterical with his chariot and his racism.  Let's babble.  Let's babble.  Let's share it on.  Let's babble. 
[03:58:00]  We've been babbling.  Let's get out of here.  Yeah, it's time for the meetings.  We've been doing a long day.  Let's meet.  Bye, guys.  What?  Bye.  Have a meeting.  See you guys Saturday.  All right.  Shut the equipment off.  I always feel, like, funny getting up and leaving with the equipment all still on.  Yeah, you can't stop.  Yeah.  Shut it down, Dan.  We shut down the show.  This old gag.  That means you can't stop talking until it's over.  You know how it is.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  That's good, man.  That's why everyone's babbling.  Where are you going, Quinn? 
[03:58:30]  I'll tell you exactly where I'm going.  Hold on.  I mean, I'm going to the Catholic channel first.  I'm a little late for that.  The Catholic channel.  I mean, you guys don't know.  How are you doing?  Oh, Alex Twato.  Then I'm going to Getting Late with Jake.  Bobby, you're going to like this one.  Then after the Catholic channel, I'm going to Getting Late with Pete Dominic.  And then what are you doing?  Comedy by request with Pete Dominic.  And then what?  The Bauer Show.  What, you got a whole thing of shows you got to do today?  Brewer Unleashed. 
[03:59:00]  That's it.  Tell Brewer we said hi.  That's a lot of fucking press.  And tell Brewer we said hi.  Pete Dominic.  Even though he's over there.  And not to be a stranger.  What?  Why don't you want me to tell Pete Dominic you said hi to me?  I don't know him.  I know Pete.  Really?  You a good guy?  Oh, he's a good guy.  Fuck that guy.  All right.  Hey, Colin.  Tell the Catholic channel he said hi or whatever it is.  I don't know why.  You want to get some food?  No.  What do you mean, no?  How about when you're about to get food?  Why not?  I don't want to break bread with you this evening. 
[03:59:30]  I don't want to break bread with you.  What's wrong with you, dude?  I just don't want to.  Why?  I'm not doing anything else.  I don't want to.  I don't think I'm going to kill you, company.  Wow, that is some honesty.  Yeah, you can't get it.  It's all he's got left is honesty.  Oh, my God.  I don't have anything to do.  But I don't want to eat with you.  You laugh like Santa Claus?  It's all I have left.  You're right.  I don't have the fucking bountiful gifts you've got left.  Bye, boys. 
[04:00:00]  Thank you.  Ah, Mr. Quinn, take it easy.  Always a pleasure.  Fucking Colin.  Take it easy, Bobby.  Characters.  Never realized we're still in the air.  It's always the way.  You never get it.  If you want to look at what I did, let me know.  How many times can we do this gag?  He does a great job.  How many times can we actually pull this gag off before they know? 
[04:00:30]  Don't wait.  Yeah, I know.  Please.  That was good.  You got some really funny stuff.  So you think it stops when they think the mics are off?  That shit will continue constantly.  They just bash each other.  How do you want to become part of that, Than?  That whole fraternity of just shitting on each other and people.  Do you agree with the comics are fucked up?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You got your ghosts and skeletons.  Sometimes I'm worried I'm not fucked up enough. 
[04:01:00]  Fucked up enough?  Yeah.  That can only mean you're so fucked up that you don't even see it.  Because if you see your fucked up-edness, then that's kind of cool.  It's like the people that if you think you're crazy, you're not crazy kind of a thing, which  I don't believe anyway.  Yeah.  I think every crazy person knows they're fucking crazy.  But if you're a comic and you think you're not fucked up enough, you're probably twice  as fucked up as a comic should even be.  Good for you. 
[04:01:30]  Eric's telling us we're running out of time in the air of the Paul Obie.  Yeah, we got to do the Paul Obie.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, fuck.  Yeah, fuck the Anthony show.  Yeah, I hear you.  Right.  Good.  How about the Iraq show then?  Go fuck yourself.  Are you still on the air?  Yeah, I'm done though.  All right.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Thank you.  Political talk.  No.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show. </pre>
