<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with playful ribbing of Mars, whose seating arrangement is deemed less than optimal ("kids' table"), following a previous day's appearance. Sam's online activities – characterized by Rob Zombie wallpaper, wrestling fascination, and Nike sneaker design browsing – are then satirized.  This leads to a broader discussion of sneaker collecting, referencing Patrice O'Neal's anecdotes about extravagant sneaker purchases, and contrasting male and female shoe-buying habits, including a humorous anecdote about a police officer, Keith, surprisingly knowledgeable about women's shoes.  Sam's unusual hairstyle and phone habits (revealed via text messages exposing his relationship status) become further targets of playful mockery.  The conversation progresses to technological advancements, specifically mobile phones and apps like "Bump," with humorous comparisons to "docking."

The iPhone and a Major League Baseball app become the focus, followed by a call from Dr. Steve that leads to crude jokes about Sam's health.  The discussion then shifts to Jay-Z's new album, with speculations of plagiarism from Billy Joel's work.  The baseball playoffs are discussed extensively, highlighting team allegiances and comments on players like Jeter and A-Rod. An iPhone autocorrect changing "Jeter" to "heterosexual" sparks further humor.  A lengthy, and seemingly annoying, audio clip of an interview with Yankee announcer John Sterling is played, generating exasperated commentary.  The segment concludes with anticipation – expressed with profanity – for the upcoming guests: Lita Ford and Jim Gillette, including speculation about their relationship and the potential for a chaotic interview.

The next segment heavily focuses on the upcoming interview with Lita Ford and Jim Gillette.  The hosts express significant apprehension, using profanity to convey their anticipation (or lack thereof).  A Nitro song is played and mocked.  Crude and disparaging remarks about John and Kate Plus 8 follow.  A significant portion debunks a claim from Lita Ford's press kit about her CD's Amazon ranking.  Further mockery ensues, along with a review of other facts about Ford's career, including her engagement to Tony Iommi and her role in *Brutal Legend*. Both Opie and Anthony reveal they turned down roles on *Surreal Life*.

Rich Voss, a frequent guest, arrives early for a "Jocktober" segment, focusing on other radio shows.  Voss discusses other radio personalities using insulting language, engages in banter, and shows his abs on-air, prompting further crude commentary and speculation about his sexuality.  A video of a provocative dance is shown, followed by a clip of former Philly television personality Stanley T., generating more vulgar jokes.  Numerous sexually explicit and offensive statements are made throughout this segment, often targeting various racial and ethnic groups.

A segment critiquing Lee and Alana, hosts of a Portland country radio show (KUPL), follows.  Opie, Anthony, and Sam mock their show segments – a daily poll, "best comment of the morning," and a "10-second tirade" – using vulgar language and offensive stereotypes.  Audio clips of Lee and Alana are played and mocked, including their attempts at Canadian accents.  Side tangents include a "What's Wrong With His Mouth?" segment, speculation on various people's appearances, jokes about bodily functions and sex, and a discussion of *Curb Your Enthusiasm*'s improvisation.  A pronunciation challenge between Rich and Mars concludes the segment, which is rife with vulgarity, sexual innuendo, and offensive commentary.

The show continues with light banter between the hosts and Mars, promoting his gigs. A celebrity identification game ensues, played by Mars and Rich Voss, with numerous mispronunciations, incorrect guesses, and off-topic discussions including fart jokes.  The hosts deviate from the rules frequently while struggling to identify celebrities like the Gosselins, Buscemi, LaBeouf, Phoenix, Romijn, Kutcher, and Krasinski.  Rich Voss ultimately wins the chaotic competition.  A studio interview with Lita Ford and Jim Gillette follows, discussing their life on a private Caribbean island, including their water supply, workforce, and security measures.  The segment concludes with discussions of the island's inhabitants and their relationship with Gillette and Ford, interspersed with more off-color jokes.

The final segment features a detailed discussion about a sex swing from Stockroom.com, focusing on Lita Ford and Jim Jelani's experience.  The conversation is explicitly sexual, detailing various practices and preferences.  They received a large vibrator as a gift from the hosts, which is met with humorous and crude reactions.  A phone call with Rich's wife, Bonnie, reveals her openness to kinky activities.  Lita Ford and Jim Jelani discuss their relationship, active sex life, and their children's unusual upbringing, including their exposure to the couple's open sexuality and martial arts involvement.  Lita Ford also discusses her music career and the making of *Wicked Wonderland*.  The segment concludes with a song from Lita Ford.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And we're off.  Hi.  Good morning to everybody.  Good morning.  Why is Mars sprinting down the hall?  Everything okay?  Oh, I hope so.  Now he's walking.  Very slowly.  I think he's out of breath.  He's supposed to be in the best shape of all of us, but I question that highly.  Oh, physical shape?  Yeah.  Not mental.  No, not mental shape.  Listening to him yesterday was hysterical.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  He signed up for Jimmy.  He did a good job.  Did he?  Yeah, he did great. 
[00:00:30]  I was listening to a little bit of that on the replay.  Wow.  What's up, Mars?  Did you survive your beating from yesterday?  I was pretty good there, Mars.  Yes, I did.  Yeah.  How's the arm?  How's the elbow?  The arm is getting better.  Thank you.  Don't sit down.  We didn't invite you to the big table.  Just say hi to you.  He's ready to take the seat.  He grabbed the headphones.  He's all ready to sit in.  It's very special when we invite someone to the big table.  Yes, it is.  You're allowed to say hi. 
[00:01:00]  Hi.  You just came by to get the potatoes.  Wow.  Bring them back to the small table.  The kids' table.  Yeah.  It looks like someone got very comfortable from yesterday's appearance.  Well, Jimmy's not here, so I thought maybe you want to...  We'll decide who sits at the big table.  We haven't decided yet.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  We might move Danny down a seat.  I don't know what we're going to do yet.  Look at Danny.  Whoa!  Although having Sam on the internet thing is just an atrocity.  It was horrendous yesterday.  He is the worst on that thing.  That's not his strong up. 
[00:01:30]  No, not his strong suit.  No.  He just kept downloading Rob Zombie wallpaper every time you guys asked him so much.  Rob Zombie stuff, wrestling.  Designing sneakers on Nike.com.  Yeah, that's Sam.  Rappers, wrestling, and yeah.  For a guy that looks like he's never done a day of activity in his life, he sure enjoys  his sneakers.  Kind of strange.  That's because they probably wear out with the...  No, the bad alignment that he has.  Oh, right. 
[00:02:00]  He needs an alignment.  He goes through treads.  He's part of that culture that they buy sneakers and a lot of times they don't even wear them.  They just keep them in boxes.  Yeah, like they're collector's items or something.  He's part of that culture.  Yeah, I know.  I found sneakers that I like and that doesn't happen a lot.  And I've just been buying the same pair of sneakers for probably the last four years.  Why not?  Why not if you're happy with them?  When I like a pair of sneakers, I just buy two right out of the box.  Well, that's good. 
[00:02:30]  You have two feet.  Well, oh, you mean...  Two pairs.  Two pairs.  That'd be silly hopping around.  And then I just kind of rotate them and they last twice as long if you think about it.  Yes, they would.  Probably longer than that.  But that other culture...  Fucking Patrice told us.  Yeah.  Some of these guys, they buy sneakers, they wear them once.  Yep.  And then they're no good anymore.  Done.  According to Patrice.  That's insane.  Well, you don't want a scuff mark on them is grounds for, you know... 
[00:03:00]  Well, that better be a special day when you decide to finally wear the sneakers once, right?  That's such a bitch thing.  Such a bitch thing.  To collect sneakers?  Yeah.  It's kind of like collecting shoes?  That's like the shoe thing with, like, chicks love their shoes.  Not all he is, I know, but, you know, that whole shoe thing.  Wow.  I don't get it.  And then the sneaker thing, I think, is a lot like that.  It's, you know, what do you want to open up in your closet and go, hmm, I like that. 
[00:03:30]  I got, like, one pair of sneakers, pair of dress shoes, combat boots, and then, like, some in-between dress and sneakers shoes.  Yeah, there you go.  That's all you need.  Good to go.  Be a man.  I think women buy shoes just to impress other women.  Yeah, they absolutely do.  And some men.  Most men don't notice women's fucking feet.  You know who's crazy with shoes?  Who?  Keith the cop.  Keith loves the shoes.  Keith is insane, like, he knows all the brands and, like, knows how to, he knows how to shop for women's shoes to wear, like, you know, his wife would be like, oh, those are beautiful. 
[00:04:00]  And, like, a guy, but I would not know.  No.  Like, to me, it could be anything from the best high-heeled shoe for a girl or bunny slippers.  Yes.  Like, I wouldn't even know what is as good.  Every once in a while you notice, but in general, no.  I think in general, women just are impressing other women with their footwear. 
[00:04:30]  To me, it's part of the whole package.  Again, you know, you see a girl that's well-dressed in a nice dress.  Sure.  And she's wearing nice shoes.  Sure.  I don't go, like, wow, look at those shoes.  I just go, oh, that is an attractively dressed woman from head to toe.  Very nice package.  The whole package.  I'll take it apart and then look at the shoes.  The shoes are like the cherry on top of a sundae.  Yeah.  I mean, it completes the sundae, but.  But you could take and throw it, too.  You could take it, throw it, and then guess what?  The sundae's still delish.  Delicious.  Delish. 
[00:05:00]  Is there anything worse than the word delish?  Delish.  Ugh.  Yeah, I don't really get it.  No.  God, do they look uncomfortable, too.  That's all.  I've seen women's feet bent up like fucking pretzels to fit in high-heeled shoes.  Oh, my God.  Just bought these, too.  Okay, I can't say what you just wrote.  Very nice.  Yeah.  Yeah, the girls suffer.  Like, their toes are bent.  Like, the arch of their foot is bent all the way up, so their heel could be in that high-heeled part. 
[00:05:30]  They must all get arthritis of the big toe.  Got it.  Sam is running down the hall.  Sam, what do you got?  Oh, my God.  Here he is.  Are you handing in today's jocktober, my friend?  Yeah.  What's going on with your hair?  What do you mean?  It looks flat.  It's not as puffy.  Did you cut it?  No.  Hell, no.  He's really pulling it back.  What is that?  It does look a lot different.  It's not as puffy.  It's a good hair day, I guess.  I don't know.  I think it's stopped really growing.  I think you've reached this point where it kind of is stopping. 
[00:06:00]  Well, it crimps up a lot now, so it's hard to tell.  Does it, yo?  And...  Is it dreading on you a little bit?  No, because I had to get this...  I think it's made for women, but it's this curly hair, shampoo, and conditioner.  No, it's not Vagisil.  It's a...  And it says...  It gives your curl a lot of sass, is what it says on the bottle.  Is it for black people? 
[00:06:30]  I think...  No, actually, I think it's for Hispanic girls.  Hispanic girls?  It's meant for a looser curl.  My mom gave it to me because she said it worked well for my brother's hair.  Why, does your brother have, like, kinky hair?  Yeah, but he's got, like, looser...  His hair, it doesn't grow out.  It kind of comes down like a nice...  Like, he's a very good-looking boy.  Much better-looking than me.  Same problem I had growing up.  I got that big afro thing going, and my brother always had, like, the long hair.  Long, curly hair, and I was just annoyed with it.  Yeah, like, he's got, like, curls that come down, and all the girls like it and everything. 
[00:07:00]  Bitch, right?  It's not a right thing.  And yours just goes out like a big fucking nuclear explosion mushroom cloud.  Yeah, like, all the girls want to touch it, because it's, like, a freakish sort of...  Cut it off and put it on your cock.  Yeah.  Okay, that's exactly what you should be doing.  Lemonade.  Yeah.  Do you have a big afro down there?  No, I mean...  Do you let that grow, too?  That's a bit more suitable.  I think we'll have to ask this special lady.  Well, I haven't gone all the way with her yet. 
[00:07:30]  You two haven't gone all the way?  No.  I'll ask her.  Yeah, that's such a load of shit.  Oh, you're texting her?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,  Oh, what?  Oh, he's texting Sam's chick.  No, I'm not.  That's not...  That would be crazy.  I don't even know why you have her phone number.  Really.  That is weird.  I mean, that doesn't seem necessary.  How did that happen?  I don't know.  What are you talking about?  Awkward.  He asked her for it.  Right.  And then she gave it to him.  And she really just jumped at it.  Okay, here it is.  Wow.  I don't understand why she would.  Well, and, you know, there's a few girls on my phone with the same name, so that's the 
[00:08:00]  only reason I put her in as side piece.  That's all, Sam.  I mean, you've got to come up with nicknames for people that, you know, if you have more  than one name in your phone, you can't have a last name or like an initial or a side piece.  You know what the greatest thing is about the times we live in and the cell phones and  everything like that?  And this has got to be the truth.  It is so much easier to ask people for their phone number.  It really is.  I just put your number in my phone. 
[00:08:30]  Just put your number in here.  It used to be like, you got a pen, paper, like the whole act of getting the pen and a  piece of paper was just awkward and then writing it down.  Now it's just like you could just toss someone your phone and go, could you throw your number  in there?  Or here, call me and I'll have your number and this one.  Aren't they coming up with the technology where you just touch phones?  Yeah, you could do that already.  Oh, you can, right?  There's an app called Bump.  And if you have Bump, I could just bump my contact information to you.  That's like fucking now.  It's just like you're just rubbing phones together. 
[00:09:00]  Bump me, bitch.  And it's just one bump and the person you bumped with, all their info is now on your phone or  the info they decide to give you.  And you could do pictures or files or whatever.  Danny showed me bump.  Me and Danny were bumping.  Yeah, we bumped.  We bumped.  What?  We bumped pictures.  Yeah.  Just to see if it worked.  Did you bump cockheads?  It's like docking.  Yeah, they just should call it docking.  Call it docking.  If that stupid company that is getting all our money had a sense of humor, they would 
[00:09:30]  just call it docking.  Docking.  They put it on a cell phone with a foreskin on it.  Right.  So you could just roll it over the other phone.  I'm great with that.  I can't.  Hey, man.  You want to dock?  Nokia docking phone.  Just slide the foreskin.  Why don't we have a picture of docking?  I really need to make a docking station now.  You need docking.  Yeah.  No picture of docking.  Huh?  No picture of docking.  Oh, Danny was a star.  There it is.  That just looks silly. 
[00:10:00]  There's a pic of it.  I like Danny exchanging.  I like how the guy is.  Contact info.  He's like presenting it to you.  He's got to support the middle or it'll fall down like a suspension bridge.  They're docked, but he's got to hold it in the middle.  It's like they're refueling.  Refueling in midair.  He has a midair refueling.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  That is the dopiest looking thing.  That's cool.  The bump.  I like the bump.  The bump's cool.  The bump.  I got to get a new phone. 
[00:10:30]  Blackberry's going to lose me as a customer unless they come up with a much better phone.  Well, good luck.  You got to get that.  Hopefully by the end of the year, I think they might have something.  My brother just got the iPhone.  It's so funny when people first get an iPhone years after they've come out and you've had  and your friends have had iPhones for so long because he's just like, dude, I got this iPhone.  It's fantastic.  It does this and that.  Like, yeah.  Where you been?  I know it does.  Yeah, I'm up to five.  He sent me like he texted me and he's in the era where you can text pictures. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  And I feel like, hey, I went through the time where we couldn't do that.  Yes.  You know, I went through the lean years and now he's texting me like the pictures where  he smears the face and makes it all like Black Hole Sun video-ish and then sends it to me.  He's like, yeah, yeah, funny.  It's great.  You know, it's fucking years ago, you immature fuck.  I got an iPhone at home.  And I only carry it around when I want to listen to Sirius XM.  Not to brown nose a little bit, but that's the only reason. 
[00:11:30]  I carry it around a lot.  Huh?  You must carry it around a lot.  No, not really, Sam.  Newest app for the iPhone.  It downloaded it last night.  At bat 2009.  Major League Baseball.  You can watch any of the playoff games, everything in quad mode, various camera angles that you're  not seeing on the game on television.  What are you talking about?  Dude, you can watch the games.  No.  Yes!  It's the best $10 you can spend.  Major League Baseball signed off on that? 
[00:12:00]  It is fantastic.  It's Major League Baseball's app.  It's their app.  Wait, so you have this app.  Walk me through it.  I'm still a little confused.  I can...  Let's say Jeter's up.  As a game is playing, I could watch and watch all kinds of views, like dugout view, fucking  watch it from the outfield, like the picture view.  Right on your iPhone?  Right there on the iPhone at all times.  Is the video smooth?  Highlight clips.  It is fucking silk smooth.  What the fuck?  And highlights, like all of a sudden, maybe you got to the game, you're watching the game 
[00:12:30]  late or something like that.  Yeah.  Or you're at the fucking game, now you can see the replays and everything like that,  and they got all the highlights, so I want to see Jeter's maybe tying home run last night.  I hit that clip.  That's a hell of a shot.  I hit that clip and watch that clip a thousand times if I want to.  It is an amazing app.  So Jeter's up at bad, then you could switch camera angles and stuff.  Yeah, switch camera angles, watch the game.  Wow, the future.  It is an amazing app.  Somebody turned me on to it last night while I was twittering. 
[00:13:00]  God damn it.  The iPhone just has so many fucking cool things.  I got a pill.  Dropped calls, schmopped calls.  I don't care.  I never talk to anyone on my phone anyway.  Why do I give a shit if I have a dropped call?  Who talks to people on their phone?  Nobody stop calling me.  I text.  That's what I do.  No one uses their phone to actually make a phone call.  Don't even call it a phone.  We've been saying this for about a year.  It's a tricorder.  When my phone rings, I get all bummed out because I know it's some old school friend that isn't up on technology. 
[00:13:30]  Exactly.  I'm like, why are you calling me?  Here is every time my phone rings.  Hello, Anthony.  It's Sam.  Hi.  Like, oh, yeah, that's right.  It's some old fart that should be looking at the river.  The river.  I made some beautiful things.  It's like.  It's always some old fart.  There's no fucking reason. 
[00:14:00]  That technology scared them.  Oh, I can't.  I can't work a computer.  It might blow up in my face.  Text.  Dr. Steve called me a couple days ago on the phone.  Well, that's different.  You know.  Dr. Steve.  You got an itch, don't you?  You got an itch.  No, it's Ross.  Hey, what do you got?  He was calling for his business, not for my business.  Little pussy dick.  What do you got?  No.  What do you got?  The chlamydia?  What are we talking about?  He was trying to promote his radio show.  I did not have a medical issue.  Got a little itch.  What do you got there?  Pink sock?  I would not.  Some kind of weird blemish on your ball bag? 
[00:14:30]  What is it?  What do you got?  What do you got?  A little chafing of the taint?  You got some leaking?  What do you got going on, Sam?  Raw balls?  Dr. Steve is one of the greatest doctors of all time, but I would never go to him for  medical advice because you all know him.  Oh, and he would rat out?  Who knows?  The guy has an oath.  It's a Hippocratic oath.  Too many people know who Dr. Steve is.  That means you got something going on.  Yeah, yeah.  He's got something.  Medical issues are not to be discussed in person.  Are you pink sock and are you trying to figure out how to get it back to you?  He's got a prolapsed ass and some kind of thick, mucousy discharge. 
[00:15:00]  No, I don't have any discharge.  Do you have discharge?  No.  No discharge.  Is one of your ball bags blowing up?  Oh, creamy.  No.  And it's twice the size of the other one?  What do you got?  No, there's nothing wrong with my pubic region.  No?  No.  No, my privates are fine.  Why?  Because you shaved all your hair to get rid of the critters?  Good for you.  What about your freckle?  What freckle?  How's your freckle?  Oh, you got a freckle?  I don't know.  How's your freckle? 
[00:15:30]  What's a freckle?  A freckle.  It's your anus there, so.  It's around the back, eh?  No.  I know.  I know.  I know.  My anus is just fine.  How's your arming?  Is it busted?  Sam's got an STD.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  Bess, get that chick down.  I wish you wouldn't spread that rumor.  I know.  I know.  Why else would you be calling Dr. Steve?  Who are you kidding?  He called me, I just said.  You're too young to have anything else, so it's got to be an STD. 
[00:16:00]  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  An STD.  He called me wanting to know if Steve Blatter had got the beer mug that he sent him.  Oh, God.  Are you kidding?  No.  He said Steve Blatter never sent him a thank you email for the weird medicine beer mug that  he sent him.  Tell Dr. Steve to stop sending out shitty gifts.  It's embarrassing to everybody.  He sent me a weird medicine dog bowl. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  I got it.  Oh, for Dexter.  For Dexter.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  For my 26th birthday, I got a weird medicine sweatshirt.  Boy, he really is.  Dr. Steve sends me whiskey.  Yeah.  I got a real present.  Well, what do you want, Sam?  It's not.  You just spent like 15 minutes talking about what I like.  You want him to go to Toys R Us for you?  What do you want?  I wouldn't.  I mean, if he's down something.  He's a Toys R Us kid.  You can buy me some sneakers.  All right, Sam.  We're going to talk baseball now.  Is that okay with you? 
[00:17:00]  A little bit.  Baseball.  Oh, it's not wrestling.  Sorry.  And it's not rap.  Jay-Z's got a new song.  He's got a whole new album.  Jay-Z's got a new song that's ripping off Billy Joel, my friend.  A Hundred Problems and a Bitch Sweat?  No, that's an old song.  Oh.  Manhattan has a hundred streets.  And Broadway's one.  Yeah, is that it?  No.  Something like that, though.  There's a song called Empire State of Mind.  Well, wonderful.  Oh, all right.  I liked it better when it was called New York State of Mind. 
[00:17:30]  Empire State of Mind.  That's not it.  I don't care if it's MLK Boulevard.  That's not it.  It's a playoff of New York.  Oh, there it is.  Is it a playoff?  Empire State of Mind.  Empire State.  And you normally would say Empire State State of Mind.  It's a playoff.  Listen to it.  It's great.  He's still got it.  Almost 40 years old.  He's still not the new Sinatra.  Yes, he is. 
[00:18:00]  How could he be the new Sinatra?  This generation's Sinatra.  His rap songs are too wordy.  Too many words, man.  He doesn't even write them.  He's still not the new Sinatra.  Catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons whipping pastry.  Cruising down A Street.  Off-white Lexus.  Driving so slow.  You know what he says in this song?  What?  He claims he made Lexus.  He made the...  He's got to fucking talk about that car.  That's right.  He's right.  Oh.  He says he made the Yankee head more famous than the Yankee game.  Shut it.  Yeah, the Beastie Boys did very good to the five boroughs. 
[00:18:30]  Yes, people sing about New York.  It's where they come from.  All right.  Well, let's sing about something else.  Sinatra did it.  Yes.  That's any...  Shout out to Sinatra.  It's up to you.  New York, New York.  Yeah.  Ken from Connecticut wants to know if there's a song,  another Billy Joel song on the album  named Piano. 
[00:19:00]  Piano.  No.  Oh, no.  Instead of man, another word for man.  There's nothing.  Piano.  No, there's no song.  No, no.  Ay, nigh.  Ay, nigh.  Ay, nigh.  Ay, nigh.  There's no song with the word piano in it.  Uh, Duvall is, uh, saying, uh, he likes the song Uptown Bitch. 
[00:19:30]  No, that's not...  Uptown Bitch, he's got...  I don't know that song.  And I know...  Uptown Bitch.  No.  He doesn't riff on Billy Joel.  Well, he did.  No.  This is Empire State of Mind.  JC is too big to care about Billy Joel.  What was the Billy Joel song?  A bottle of red.  Yeah.  A bottle of white.  A bottle of...  Change that to a bottle of...  A bottle of...  A crystal.  A bottle of Colt 45.  No.  See how he said 45?  Yeah, I hadn't noticed that.  45.  45.  I hadn't noticed that.  JC's too big to rip off Billy Joel. 
[00:20:00]  Empire State of Mind.  He could have at least seen from a Popeye's restaurant.  Yeah, I don't like that.  Only everyone dies young.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That's not right.  That's bad.  Come on now.  And none of those are songs on the album.  Oh, we started all the fires.  Okay. 
[00:20:30]  Never moving out.  Fucking Jay-Z.  Ripping off Billy Joel.  Why is he ripping off so many Billy Joel songs?  He didn't do any of those songs.  Oh, that's terrible.  Yes, he's ripping them all off.  No, he's not.  He didn't do any of those.  Oh, I'm just Empire State of Mind, and that's a playoff of the term New York City.  No, it's not.  It's not.  Oh, no.  Does he have a song called The Stranger?  But in parentheses, it says Daddy. 
[00:21:00]  No, of course not.  He did, you know, his father did leave at a young age.  Is this true?  We're living here in Allen Iverson Town?  No.  His father's leave.  No.  At an alarming rate in the black community.  What?  There's no Allen Iverson Town.  She's always a hoe to me.  Nope.  That's not a song on any Jay-Z album.  I thought it was.  No.  He's never done.  Because he's ripping off Billy Joel completely.  He's not at all.  He is. 
[00:21:30]  He's better than Billy Joel.  What?  Yeah.  Billy Joel has a lot more hits, my friend.  He sure does.  Jay-Z sold more records.  No.  Yes.  Oh.  Let me see.  Go back.  I know more of the...  I'm not an innocent man.  No, he's never said that.  He was found not guilty of all charges that he's brought up on.  Oh.  Oh.  I see.  Oh.  Not guilty.  Thank you very much. 
[00:22:00]  Oh.  Oh, God.  What?  You got one?  No, no.  No.  Something about the Empire State Building that I'm not going to say.  Oh, wow.  Because it's Empire State of Mind?  No.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's the song, right?  Yes.  Empire State of Mind.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's his single he's got out right now, and it's really good.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  It's bonkers.  See, we're doing it without using the N-word, guys.  Come on.  Come on, guys.  No matter how much we love to. 
[00:22:30]  Believe it or not, we like to try to be creative here on the show.  At least I got it.  All right, Sam.  All right.  Thanks for filling us in on the black culture.  Thanks.  I mean, you just...  Sickle cell?  What about it?  Is it sickle cell?  What is what sickle cell?  Well, you're calling Dr. Steve.  Something's going on.  I don't have sickle cell anemia.  You don't have sickle cell anemia?  I would guess you got a leaky dick.  Why?  Or you got the sickle cell.  I have neither of those two things. 
[00:23:00]  Mm-hmm.  All right.  All right.  We're going to talk baseball now, Sam.  Is that okay with you?  A little b-ball, because, you know, playoffs.  Oh, yeah.  It's post-season now, my friend.  A lot of my teams won.  Yeah?  I'm going Dodgers.  Mm-hmm.  I'm going Phillies.  Yes, Phillies.  Phillies all the way, by the way.  That's my team for the World Series.  Slow down.  Well, I was talking to someone in the gym yesterday, and they're trying to, like, go rah-rah about  the Yankees.  I'm like, look, I'm a Mets fan, and I'm not going to do this fair weather, I got to now 
[00:23:30]  root for the Yankees shit.  And know what the guy actually said to me?  Aw.  I'm like, you should be happy as a Yankee fan that Mets fans aren't jumping on board.  Look, my friend.  I hate when they do that to us.  You have an ulterior motive to root for the Phillies.  Why?  Have a job.  It's my second home.  At this point, it's my second home.  I know.  That's what I mean.  Yeah.  So you're going to...  I'm going Phillies.  I'm going Twins, because I just can't fucking...  Twins?  Yes, I can't fucking root for the Yankees. 
[00:24:00]  All right.  And the Twins retired yesterday.  That's the only reason they lost.  Oh, is that it?  They were popping champagne and then getting on a 3 a.m. flight to New York.  I mean, of course they were going to lose yesterday.  We'll see how they work tomorrow after a nice day's rest.  Everyone can simmer down a little bit.  Going Red Sox, because we lived up there.  Red Sox?  Going Red Sox.  First of all, the Angels are playing for a dead guy.  So that's kind of...  I know.  You know, they're dedicated.  And the Angels are a tough team, too. 
[00:24:30]  The Angels are a very tough team.  Very tough team.  And then I'm going with, like you were saying just before the show, the miserable bastard  himself, Joe Torre.  Joe Torre.  I'm going Dodgers.  You know, I was...  Those are my teams.  I realized that last night.  After watching the Yankee game, the Dodgers were...  You know, the Dodgers came on.  I'm watching the Dodger game a little bit.  And I see Joe Torre.  And it's like, it just made me appreciate the energy of a Joe Girardi.  Like, I like Torre.  Don't get me wrong.  Of course.  You know, I was rah-rah for Torre. 
[00:25:00]  He brought the team to a lot of championships.  But just to see him there on the rail of the dugout with that miserable fucking face,  just all in that Dodger uniform, just...  You know, there's a two-run homer.  It fucking pulls him ahead.  And he's just like...  Well, if you haven't been able to sit down in seven years, what kind of face would you  be making?  That's true.  Oh, my God.  It's like the Zim's head.  It's giant. 
[00:25:30]  People would beg me not to root for the Dodgers.  I got to root for my teams.  Yeah.  I got my teams.  Your teams.  Oh, people hate my sports curse.  Yeah, they do.  That's out of...  That's just exaggerated at that point.  Come on.  It certainly is.  Come on.  They just notice the bad things that happen.  They don't notice when your teams actually win.  Yeah, like the last time I...  That one time when I rooted for...  And they...  I can't even give you my last winner at this point.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:26:00]  What do you think of your Yankees?  I think they looked great.  CeCe on the mound looked very good.  He's a big boy.  Yeah, he certainly is.  Has he gained even more weight?  Holy shit.  He is a biggin'.  He's got a loose-fitting uniform.  Yes, he certainly does.  Oh, my God.  I love the pictures.  The pictures are allowed to be, like, just kind of little slovenly.  David Wells was like that, too.  Yeah.  In between every pitch, he had to be tucking something back in.  Pulling fat around the back of them and shit.  Just constantly adjusting and tucking.  They just somehow figure out how to get all that fat momentum into the ball. 
[00:26:30]  Amazing.  I don't know how they do that.  The wind-up and everything, it takes all that moving fat and gets it right into the arm.  It's kind of like doing some fly fishing.  You've got to get it just right before you release.  Just right.  Just right.  Just right.  Release.  And Jeter, what more can you say about this guy?  Jesus, he's just gorgeous.  And, ooh, the captain.  He's got something going on that we don't know about.  He's too perfect.  He really is.  He's got something. 
[00:27:00]  Like, the perfect fucking ball player.  Something will come out eventually.  No scandal.  He's never had a scandal.  We started the show talking about shoes.  Imagine he's the perfect human being, but he has to wear a fucking girl's shoes around  the house or something.  Like, he's got to make sure all the shades are pulled down and everything because he's  Derek Jeter.  And he just has to.  No scandals.  Nothing.  He just puts these into a nice set of pumps.  Or someone suggesting that he's a serial killer.  Right.  Something.  He just goes out and cuts up hookers. 
[00:27:30]  You know what?  Well, let's think about it.  It's the people like Jeter that you should really worry about.  That you should be watching.  Because they're too perfect.  Yeah.  You know what you get with us.  Yeah, exactly.  What the fuck is Jeter hiding?  Crap.  But at least you know.  With Jeter, come on.  Yeah.  You're trying to tell me he's going to be the first perfect human being to walk this  earth?  He's got something going on.  Yeah.  Well, he's done a good job of hiding it.  Yeah.  He stepped up there.  Nice two-run homer.  Put the Yankees ahead.  And then A-Rod snapping that post-season slump-a-rooney that he's been in. 
[00:28:00]  What do you have?  Two hits?  Two ribbies?  Two RBIs from A-Rod.  Two RBI.  RBI, right.  You don't say RBIs.  Ugh.  Stop it.  RBIs.  When I hear sports radio go, he had five RBIs.  Ribbies.  We've been saying RBIs forever.  I don't care if it's grammatically correct or not.  It just sounds right.  Run bad at inses.  Whatever.  It just sounds right.  And when they go, five RBI. 
[00:28:30]  RBI.  RBI.  But it was good.  They looked good.  Yeah, I enjoyed the first four out of the five-and-a-half-hour game.  You know.  It ran over a little.  A little.  I was happy that the game started at six.  I'm like, wow, for once, because we do this morning radio crap, it's tough to stay up late  and watch some of these sporting events.  It just is.  I'm like, wow, the game starts at six.  This is perfect.  The game went past 10 o'clock, Ant.  Yeah, it did.  The Yankees actually brought in a pitcher to throw one pitch. 
[00:29:00]  What was that about?  He threw one pitch.  Well, he got the guy out, and then, you know, they had to bring up another pitcher for the  next batter.  But it's like, how the fuck do you?  That's why the games take so long.  That's specialty shit.  That's why the game takes so long.  You remember the time.  It was a starting pitcher and one relief pitcher, and that was pretty much it.  And if the relief pitcher went down, then all of a sudden, you're telling the fucking, like, 
[00:29:30]  the right fielder, warm up your arm.  We have no one else.  Yeah.  You're going in.  Yeah.  Because they didn't want to, like, they didn't want to use anybody else because they were all  set for the next game.  Yep.  That's all it was.  Now forget about it.  Specialty pitchers.  I noticed something very odd last night.  I went to tweet Twitter about the game, and the first word I was writing was Jeter, and  I didn't capitalize the J, and the iPhone corrected it, and it said heterosexual. 
[00:30:00]  I swear to God.  See, he's the perfect human being.  Jeter.  I swear to God, it really did that.  It came out, if I didn't capitalize, I put G-E-T-E-R, it came out heterosexual.  You know what that means.  I looked and went, what the fuck is that about?  There's plenty of other words that could come out of that.  It was very odd, though.  Yeah.  Did it do it to you?  It just did it to you, too, right? 
[00:30:30]  Isn't that fucked up Danny just did?  Well, now Jeter's going to be pissed, and he'll make sure they correct that.  That was really strange.  Heterosexual.  That's because, you know, there's a lot of people that aren't baseball fans.  That's better than a homosexual.  That would be kind of funny.  That's when you type in, make joke here.  Yes.  Insert.  Go with Steve.  Penis here.  Yes.  I mean, the J is next to the H, so it doesn't make.  Heter.  Yeah, but it would only be heter.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, there's plenty of other words.  How does that come up heterosexual?  That's adding a little too many letters. 
[00:31:00]  There's probably not a lot of words that.  I understand how it works, Danny.  It just seems weird, though, still.  It is a little.  I'm sorry.  It was just, it took me aback when I saw it.  I was like, Jeter's a, what?  Jeter's a what?  Homosexual.  So, yeah, there you go.  Baseball's here.  Baseball's finally here.  It's nice.  It's finally here.  Oh, yeah.  That 162 game shit is for the birds.  It's good.  And, by the way, as I always state, any Yankee tickets that this organization, I know they're 
[00:31:30]  in cahoots with Major League Baseball, can give to me for the Yankee Stadium playoff games,  it's for the show.  Not for me personally.  I would never do that.  But it's so I could come in and discuss the game being there live with the show.  So, I'm not that selfish to, you know, say, oh, just give me tickets so I can go to the  game.  Completely show related.  Mm-hmm.  While you're at it, get me some goddamn jet tickets.  They're playing the Bills in a couple weeks and I need tickets.  Hello, Bills. 
[00:32:00]  Bills aren't that great, huh?  Bills suck.  No, huh?  I haven't been paying attention to the Bills.  Giants, Jets, I keep tabs on them.  A little bit?  Yeah, I keep tabs on them.  So, the Phillies won.  Yeah.  Everyone knows that because that game was on at, what, 11 a.m. yesterday?  It's weird this year.  It's early.  A triple header yesterday.  Yeah.  And then the Dodgers.  What time did that game end?  Dodgers and the Cardinals.  It had to be late.  For real.  It was a West Coast game.  Because it started at 9, right?  It started after the Yankee game.  Started at 9.  These games are averaging close to 4 hours, so it had to be 1 in the morning for us East 
[00:32:30]  Coasters.  Yep.  So, who stayed up to see that?  We're not talking to those people right now.  They're sleeping.  You know what?  I enjoy the TBS HD feed better than the Yes Network feed for the Yankee game.  Why?  The playoffs thing that they're doing.  Because they keep that fucking cool pitch thing up at the side of the screen.  Mm-hmm.  So, they have the strike zone, and then they show pitch one, two, and then you can see,  like, if the pitcher threw seven pitches, you can look and see where each pitch went, if 
[00:33:00]  it was in there.  We were talking about that yesterday.  Like, could they actually do the game without the umpires?  I think they could.  Because now you can just, you can see where that pitch is in the strike zone.  I think they could.  For real.  And I think they could, too.  Because I saw some crappy-ass calls as far as strikes, balls and strikes went last night.  And why are the stupid umps?  I noticed this, too, last night.  You don't notice. 
[00:33:30]  You know, they got all the padding on, but it's underneath that sports jacket.  Why are they still wearing a sports jacket?  I don't know.  It's like, I'm an umpire.  I need my sports jacket on.  It's tradition.  It's tradition.  It's like, it's stupid.  It's tradition.  It's like the manager wearing the uniform.  And I know a lot of comics have done that over the years.  Like, what's he going to do?  Get out there and play?  It's like, you know, or, you know, you don't see that in football and things like that.  The manager wearing the uniform is silly.  And the umpire's wearing that sports jacket. 
[00:34:00]  Like, I'm going out to dinner in this later.  You would think that you would get some of these fat fuck managers out of their dumb tight uniforms at this point.  Yeah.  And let them wear sweats or whatever.  And they're wearing, like, the cleats and the socks and everything.  You know, I can understand maybe a jersey.  It's for the purists.  It's for the purists.  So when he jogs out to the mound, he's, like, you know, got his cleats on.  There's sports fans.  They're all about keeping the sport completely pure instead of, like, changing with the times.  I like when a sport changes with the times. 
[00:34:30]  Maybe it is the fact that they actually do take to the field when they go and, you know, replace the pitcher.  You know, the manager goes out there.  A hundred-foot jog they do a couple times a game.  But he's on the field.  So, like, in basketball, they don't go out on the court.  They wear a nice suit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And in football, they don't take to the field, right?  They should give them more of, like, a football.  In hockey, they're not out on the ice.  But manager, I think in baseball, it's the only one that actually is out on the field at any time. 
[00:35:00]  They should allow the managers to look like the football coaches.  Kind of like some slacks.  Maybe a sweater with the logo on it.  With the fucking Tom Landry hat.  The Tom Landry hat.  The stupid Tom Landry hat.  Yeah, Tom Landry.  So, congrats on the Yankees there, buddy.  Yes.  Twins retired, though.  We'll see what they do.  Are they playing game two today?  No, that's tomorrow.  They have a day off.  Oh, they got to rest.  The Twins can finally sleep. 
[00:35:30]  They can relax a little bit.  And then we'll see.  Yeah, we'll see what they'll like on a day's rest.  Right on.  But I think, you know, they just, the Yankees just look really good this year.  They're going to be tough to beat.  Let's be honest with each other.  It really is.  They're going to be real tough to beat.  And Sox fans, I think they're going to have a hard time with the Angels.  Go Sox.  I really think they're going to have a hard time.  Go Sox.  John Sterling, Yankee announcer.  The AP did a large story on John Sterling. 
[00:36:00]  Did they?  And we brought John Sterling to a lot of people's attention because he has those horrendous home run calls.  And he has the horrendous end of the game call.  Yeah.  Even if the Yankees win 18-2, he still has this.  He's all excited with his shake.  Well, the Yankees win, he discusses it in this clip.  Oh, he does.  How he came up with it.  Yeah.  Wow.  From this booth and the one across the street at the old Yankee Stadium, John Sterling's  been broadcasting Yankee games on radio for 21 seasons. 
[00:36:30]  I love what I do.  How about the game today?  I can't wait.  So I don't have, I haven't missed a game in 21 years either.  More than two decades off without a single sick day, when Sterling gets behind the mic,  the idea that he's at work is the furthest thing from his mind.  For some, Sterling's unvarnished Yankee zeal.  Why is that insane?  He went to work.  Wouldn't you love to work 162 days a year?  That's it.  That's all he's got.  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  Why is that crazy?  I've never taken a day.  That's wonderful.  The odds of you taking a sick day are drastically reduced if you're only working 162 days a year.  Of course.  Right?  Yes.  For some, Sterling's unvarnished Yankee zeal paints him as a homer and that some of his  play-by-play calls make him seem more like a performer and less like a broadcaster.  But Sterling sees it differently.  His signature call, when his team emerges victorious, came about as a way to add life for listeners, 
[00:37:30]  rooting for an underwhelming ball club.  When I got to the Yankees, they were awful.  89 was my first year.  89, 90, 91.  They were very bad teams.  So they didn't have a lot of big wins.  So when they had a big win, I'd say, Yankees win.  And then one day, it was when they started getting good at 93, 94, one day I just happened  to put rock and roll into them.  So I'd say, Yankees win. 
[00:38:00]  The Yankees win.  A tremendous home run by Hideki Matsui.  It is a two-out, ninth inning walk-off.  A thriller by Godzilla.  The Sayonara Kid hits into the right field stands.  And the Yankees win 2-1.  Ball game over.  Yankees win.  The Yankees win.  This is the worst news story I've ever heard.  What is the point of this news story, first of all? 
[00:38:30]  This is horrible.  Second of all, the fucking interviewer is horrendous.  He won't get to his point.  He won't get to his point.  Oh, horrible.  That was almost a two-minute clip.  For what?  I'm so fucking annoyed right now.  That was horrid.  I'm like, speed it up.  And then Susan Wall...  It's not over, by the way.  Oh, no.  Susan Wallman chimes in.  You know, goodness gracious of all the dramatic things.  Looking good these days. 
[00:39:00]  You're just lonely.  Let's move on.  A little lonely.  A little lonely.  I think she'd take a phone call.  That ship has sailed.  Fucking...  That ship has sailed.  Sail.  Motherfucker.  You already ate that fish.  There's plenty of fish in the sea.  Oh, shit.  Is there?  Thanks.  Thanks.  My heart's broken, and that's all you got for me?  There's plenty of fish in the sea?  Why don't you go fuck yourself?  Hope you get run over by a semi. 
[00:39:30]  Plenty of fish in the sea.  Shut the fuck up.  I'm suicidal.  And you're going to give me some fucking nursery rhyme.  A nursery rhyme?  Thanks.  Fucking asshole friends.  The monitor's out.  Oh, no.  What happened?  I think it's the source.  I must know the source.  Salt and pepper.  They suck, too.  That's salt and pepper?  That's salt and pepper.  I did not know that.  The one's a Christian broad.  The other one's like, I don't know, a hoochie mama.  You know something?  And they're still trying to make it. 
[00:40:00]  They were trying to do some kind of comeback thing.  Never hot.  Fucking men.  Thank you.  Masculine fucking men.  And they do those videos and stuff.  They look like Madea.  Yeah.  That's fucking Madea, yo.  Madea.  That's Madea.  Madea.  You want to get back to the John Sterling thing?  Not really, but I guess we better just finish it up.  Playing fish in the sea.  Well, John is one of a kind.  There's nobody like John. 
[00:40:30]  I think we feed off each other very well.  We've been buddies for over 20 years, and we're both pretty emotional, and he gives me lots of space to do the kinds of things that I do.  And, you know, I think we're a great team.  Another delivery that listeners either love or love to hate is Sterling's unique home run call.  Many fans are convinced it was concocted in the Bronx solely for his beloved pinstripers.  But the reality is...  Is this a college kid?  Yeah, he sounds like...  Is this for college radio? 
[00:41:00]  This doesn't sound like a professional interview.  He's constantly at a yield sign trying to figure out if he should go or not.  But the reality is, it was born in Atlanta in the 1980s when Sterling was calling a Mets-Braves game on television.  Doc Gooden threw a big hanging breaking ball in the Mets, in the launching pad in Atlanta.  And it clicked in.  And when Murph hit it, you knew it was out.  And that's the first time I said, it is high, it is far, it is gone. 
[00:41:30]  More than 20 years later, the call has evolved into this.  Melky has switched it, a batting left.  Swings, drills to deep right.  That ball is high.  Middle score.  And it's gone.  Oh, the milkman delivers.  He hits a bottom of the 14th.  One out, two run, walk-off home run.  That's the Milky Way.  Melky Cabrera ends the ball game with a two-run bottom of the 14th home run. 
[00:42:00]  I thought it was a good call.  It's a long call.  But it's become very recognized.  And people kid me, you know, it's as high and as far, it's caught at the wall.  Oh, it is high and far, it's caught at the wall, or off the wall.  There's so much more that people throw that back at you, which is good.  I'm not knocking it, but, you know, the Yankees win and all that stuff.  But, you know, there's a whole lot more to the broadcast.  Are we still listening to this?  Who gives a shit?  Who's in charge of this?  Why are we still listening to this?  Who cares?  Who's that in the black bikini?  Oh, wow.  Why don't we look at that?  Who's that?  That's the... 
[00:42:30]  Who is that?  Ashley Green.  Where does she come from?  What does she do?  She's just a really hot chick.  They gotta have some, like, reason.  This is what would tylerderndoo.com?  Because sometimes when he doesn't have pictures for the story that he's talking about, he just  finds pictures of hot chicks.  Derek just peruses hot chicks on the web.  No, this is something else.  I don't know.  I won't say what side out of respect to Tyler Durden.  Ah.  Oh.  Aha.  But let me see.  I don't know who Ashley Green is.  She's probably on some awful CW show.  Yeah.  Yeah, one of those fucking... 
[00:43:00]  So...  Twilight.  That's one of them.  Twilight.  The kids love the Twilight, huh?  Ah, the kids.  The kids.  I think they're liking that.  Why don't we...  Should we play the last track?  Oh, God.  What is it?  That's probably the most boring of them.  Unless it's him, like, dying.  He talks about how he landed the gig.  Ah.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  Years ago.  Baseball has always been a passion for Sterling, and that passion helped him land a broadcast 
[00:43:30]  job with the Atlanta Braves.  But then this native New Yorker got a call that he always wanted.  A call from the Yankees.  What?  Of all the screwy things in life, I got the Yankee job without an audition.  Really?  I didn't have an agent.  What?  And I called a buddy of mine who'd been on the air with me, who's a lawyer, and he called  him up and they made a deal.  Raised in Manhattan, Sterling wanted to be on the air since he was a little kid, and  he honed his skills with broadcasting stints in Baltimore and Atlanta.  Yet while Sterling had to leave New York in order to return here and land his dream job, 
[00:44:00]  he feels his career couldn't have turned out better.  All right.  You know what?  I'm so bothered by this.  I could give a shit what he does, where he got his job, how he figured out.  He's important.  He cares about him.  Now, you're not going to believe this one, but I actually got the job without even having  an audition or having an agent. 
[00:44:30]  Can you believe it?  Wake up.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Clam up.  Can you tell it's a slow news day?  Wow.  Dude.  If that's a clip, help us out.  The AP gave you five minutes.  We can only go up from here.  Usually AP clips, like when you get them from news services and stuff, they're like tops.  60 seconds.  Oh, my God.  No.  That means we might have to go into silly mode today if it's a slow news day. 
[00:45:00]  I love silly mode.  Yeah, I'm looking at the prep sheet.  We have nothing.  We do have Jack Tober.  We do have Rich Voss.  Oh, Voss is coming in right.  And Lita Ford's coming in.  What?  And Jim Gillette.  What?  Who's coming in?  For what?  Lita Ford?  Did we go in a time machine?  And Jim Gillette.  I was just going to say that.  And Jim Gillette. 
[00:45:30]  Did we just go in a time machine?  Just tell me.  Can I ask you something?  What year is it?  It was Jim Gillette.  He's the guy that we based Rock Scream Tuesday after.  All right.  Look.  Where did that come from?  I honestly want to know.  I don't ever, ever remember.  It's always in an email.  You don't really like to read emails.  Lita Ford.  Yeah.  Who was almost popular 20 years ago. 
[00:46:00]  Would be in here today.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  No, this guy is not coming out.  Jim Gillette.  It ain't no big thing.  This guy.  That guy is coming in today.  No.  Only the best bookings for us.  Howard had Mr. October, Reggie Jackson himself.  We catch him Gillette. 
[00:46:30]  You think they'll bring him in the back way so no other shows try to steal him?  We got to just know our place in this business.  We're trying to make this into something bigger and better.  But you know what?  In the end, we're just a shitty radio show that gets shitty guests.  What the fuck are we...  Look, I honestly want to know when I agreed to Jim Gillette. 
[00:47:00]  I thought he was the razor blade fucking guy.  I'd rather have the Gillette that invented the razor blade.  I'd have a lot of questions for that guy.  Yes.  How'd you get it so thin?  Yeah.  When you guys, you know, invented the razor blade, did you realize that it would be used  for destruction?  Yes.  For people killing themselves.  Jim Gillette.  Or did you just think shaving?  Here's the...  Maybe we'll ask him questions about Gillette razor blades.  Here's the deal, Ant. 
[00:47:30]  Lita Ford is married, I think, to Jim Gillette.  No fucking way.  Yeah, I think so.  Is this the truth?  I think.  But then again, that would mean show prepping.  And I didn't feel like reading up on Lita Ford for the big interview today.  Jim Gillette, he's married to Lita Ford.  All right, when did they get married?  That's...  I gotta know.  There's no way he begged her in her prime.  I don't want...  I don't want to do this. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, that's a good point.  I don't want to do this.  I'm dreading this now.  Well, I...  I don't want to take you too inside on this one.  We were put in a tough spot on this one.  I'll just say that.  Good gravy.  You make a good point, though.  He ain't begging the young, hot Lita Ford.  No, I want to know when they hooked up.  I think Bridget Bardot is finally at a place where I think I could get her.  Raquel Welch, I think, is in my scope now. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, have you seen her in the glasses commercial?  She has the glasses, and the two young guys are looking at her going,  It's Raquel Welch!  And she's like, Hi, boys, with that fucking face.  That doesn't move anymore from all the plastic surgery?  And then the body, she's talking about it like...  They're looking at her tits, and you just know it's a disaster when the clothes come off.  She's got to be 60 fucking something years old.  They're probably going to just shoot jizz on those glasses of hers. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  Oh, that's her now?  Who's that?  Is that Jim Gillette?  Who's that?  Lita Ford, apparently.  Oh.  What?  Isn't that the chick from Friends?  Oh, my God.  It looks like Kudrow.  It looks like Lisa Kudrow a little bit.  She's got the tats.  Oh, what's with the...  Wow, she's got some...  She's got man hands.  Let's make the Lita Ford interview the best interview we've ever done.  Don't you just love Lobster?  It's going to be the best interview we've ever done. 
[00:49:30]  Is it?  Where's Ronnie B when you need him?  Oh, my God.  He'd make the Lita Ford appearance into something good.  Ron Bennington would make gold out of it.  I remember listening to Ron Bennington interview Warren Zevon's fourth wife.  She was married to him for a weekend or something.  I'm like, why am I listening to this horse shit?  And you know what?  I listened to the whole goddamn thing because of his interviewing skills.  Jesus Christ.  Ridden hard and put up wet.  God damn it. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, Christ.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I got a stomachache.  Yeah, don't get it.  I got a stomachache.  I want to go home.  This is going to be the show to listen to.  Oh, fuck.  I just have a feeling.  Oh, fuck.  We're going to be in silly mode within 20 minutes.  Oh, no.  And we're going to have a big interview with Lita Ford and the guy that screams good.  He was in the band Nitro. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Danny, hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  I really wasn't listening.  Oh, yeah.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  I wasn't really listening.  What was that fact about Jim Gillette?  Oh, he was in the band Nitro.  My newest, favorite, annoying sound effect.  He was in Tough. 
[00:51:00]  What's Tough?  I guess a band.  Really?  We got some Nitro in Dillette if you want to check it out.  No, I don't.  I have one song.  You have one song.  All right, now we have to.  This is our show prep, Opie.  Come on now.  We have to do a little work.  They look like Poison.  What is that?  Let me see.  Which one is him?  Which one was Jim Gillette?  Oh, my God.  Stop with the fucking.  That's Poison and Motley Crue.  It's every tail end.  It's the tail end of fucking hair bands. 
[00:51:30]  I mean, that's ridiculous.  What the fuck is this?  All right.  Is he going to rock scream at the beginning?  I hope so.  Thank you.  I never heard this, and I just felt it was coming.  This sounds like 20 other hair band songs all put into love.  Here it comes.  Luke's the kill.  Yeah.  I'm on a night train. 
[00:52:00]  The song's actually called Freight Train, so you were close.  All right.  All right, look.  If Lita Ford and Jim Gillette know what's good for them, they would not show up today.  Just want to put that out there.  We're warning them.  Yeah.  The chant.  Yeah.  Open phone lines.  I want to find one Nitro fan. 
[00:52:30]  One.  It's got Dial Steve's extension in the back.  Oh, really?  Yes.  You don't understand.  They were very popular.  Wow.  This is from the original motion picture soundtrack to Carnivore.  No way.  Yes.  Wow, really?  What is that thin scream?  No David Coverdale.  People are saying he's a problem. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, so am I.  Is he a problem?  I'm a problem, too.  What kind of problem could he possibly be?  Why don't we take a break, Anthony?  It's going to be one of those days.  God.  There were a few laughs in that first hour, though.  I'll tell you that much.  I better have, you know, if this is a favor, I better have a suitcase of money when I leave  this studio later.  It better be a suitcase of cash in exchange for this.  Let's go old school.  Yeah.  I need a little something something and a little something something, if you know what  I mean. 
[00:53:30]  And I haven't done that shit in, fuck, at least a month.  Well.  No, that's just a joke.  What are we going to do?  Hey, are you following this John and Kate thing?  Yeah, as much as, you know, you can not follow it because there's a lot of news on it.  Yeah, John's on TV saying how he doesn't want to be on TV.  It's the most amazing thing I've ever seen from a pseudo celebrity.  That's where people go.  He's going on every show to say he doesn't want to be a reality star and he doesn't want 
[00:54:00]  to be on TV.  That's where people go when they say they don't want to be on TV.  TV.  You go on TV.  Yeah.  To tell everyone you don't want this life anymore.  Yeah.  When the normal fuck just goes away.  Goes home in a couple of weeks.  And then the TV people are begging for you to go on TV and you just ignore them.  That's how it really works.  And then he's like, I guess he's got to go down to Philly today.  You know that he lives, and I swear to you, Anthony, two blocks away from me.  Really?  And all the footage they showed of him walking around New York yesterday is my neighborhood. 
[00:54:30]  My little piece of Manhattan that I walk around.  Your little enclave.  Yeah.  I walk around the same four blocks, and there he was.  Why don't you have a little chit-chat with him?  I was thinking about it.  Yeah.  I was thinking about it.  Bring him in.  We'll hear him badmouth that fucking twat wife of his.  Yeah, but he's not that.  His stock is dropping, too.  He's no better.  Well.  I mean, I was all rah-rah-john because we all saw how Kate treated him, but now he's making all the wrong moves.  All the wrong moves.  You take the – people, I think, assume that it's like a movie or a TV show. 
[00:55:00]  When you just take a married couple, especially when they've got that many kids and things like that, and throw them on TV, you kind of see what they're all about.  And everybody is dysfunctional.  Yeah.  So that's what you're going to see.  Well, the fame got to them.  They're using their kids for their own fame.  Yeah.  And the fame really got to them.  They don't give a shit about their kids, you know?  They would pretty much sell their kids to keep their celebrity up.  And then he's going to Philly because the two older daughters, they're having a birthday today, so there's a big deal. 
[00:55:30]  Like, John and Kate are going to be in the same house for four hours today.  What's going to happen?  So he's like, I want privacy for these kids.  I don't want – you know, whatever.  So he's shopping for their gifts on TV.  On TV.  Going, hey, I think – I forgot their names.  So I think this fucking –  This fucking moneymaker.  This fucking should have been a mistake.  Would like this watch better.  And he was watch shopping for the girls. 
[00:56:00]  Give me the watch.  What?  I'll be damned.  Full of cake and greasy hands on a watch on your birthright.  Yeah, look, he's got the cake.  Did you see Nancy Grace just give him a beating on TV?  No, really?  It's a pretty hot clip right now.  It's everywhere.  Nancy Grace.  She's a tough customer.  I hate her too, but she gave him the business.  Oh, the business.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:56:30]  All right.  Good for him.  John was being harassed by the paparazzi.  This is Pat from Menachie with an actual statement and not a joke today.  John was being harassed by the paparazzi at the Ivy.  Now, the Ivy in L.A. is – it's well known.  If you want your picture taken, if you want the paparazzi to pay attention to you,  you go to the Ivy for lunch and they just hang outside the Ivy, it's a known fact. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, that's where you go to be seen.  Proven that John just loves the fact that he's in the public eye and the paparazzi are following him around.  You know, if you don't want to be harassed by the paparazzi, there's a million places in L.A.  they would never know you're there.  They just wouldn't know you're there having lunch.  You wouldn't go to, like, the spot.  Right.  By the time that the paparazzi is tipped off that you're there, which would be, you know,  a long shot to begin with, you would be long gone.  Yeah.  Your lunch would be over.  So.  He loves it. 
[00:57:30]  He's just – he's using it as a ploy.  Yeah.  A ploy.  You want to do Jocktober next?  Please.  And who do we invite to the big table today?  Jocktober.  When is Dummy coming in?  Voss?  Yeah.  8 o'clock.  Dummy.  We should have Mars and Voss do a little competition today.  Oh, would that be great?  Could we have a mispronunciation contest with Mars and Voss today?  You know, maybe we could do another round of – 
[00:58:00]  Celebrity?  Name the celebrity.  I'm thinking that, too.  Yeah, because it sounds like they're very similar when it comes to mispronouncing celebrity names.  We could do that.  We could try that.  Is this true?  Apparently, this – Jim Gillette currently trains in mixed martial arts with the Gracie family.  Great.  I fucking love Jim Gillette.  Apparently, he's a –  I got a poster of –  Mixed martial arts guy.  Maybe Mars can help us with the interview.  Since he's into the mixed martial arts. 
[00:58:30]  According to his wiki, that information appears to be correct.  I've never seen a smaller Wikipedia entry than the Jim Gillette entry in Wikipedia.  Does he have a dojo or just a stoop?  A rape.  Let's take a break.  Open it.  All right. 
[00:59:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  Now we're cranking.  What's this again?  Rush.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  YYZ.  Thank you, Danny.  Of course.  Opie and Anthony, don't worry, guys.  We got it handled.  We got our Lita Ford one sheet in front of us.  It's going to be okay.  Yeah, we were –  We're going to get through this.  It's going to be okay because we got some great stuff to talk about with Lita Ford.  Our crack staff. 
[00:59:30]  Hard at work in the back room, and they came up with nothing but the most important stuff about Lita Ford.  And we're going to get in depth on some of these points that are made on the one sheet.  Thank you, Sam.  Thank you.  Not only did they come up with them, which they came up with a few of them, but some of these were given to them by Lita's people.  That's true.  Especially the first one.  Yeah, the first one on the one sheet for Lita Ford.  Yes.  Lita's CD is number 18 on Amazon's top 20. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  They actually gave you that information?  That email was sent to the research department, which I am the head of this morning.  That's supposed to be like a –  That was to be added.  Hey, this is to be added to the one sheet.  18 –  That's a selling point?  Yes.  Number 18 on Amazon's top 20.  Top 20.  What's number 19 and number 20?  I would bet money.  Who's that?  Wow.  Let's see.  What the fuck?  Who's that?  Totallycrap.com.  My God, man.  What the fuck?  Is that the chick from –  It's supposed to be. 
[01:00:30]  I don't know if it really is, though.  It's kind of tough to tell.  Yeah.  God, I love naked girls.  Supposedly.  Ashley Green.  Nude.  Nude.  Oh, fantastic.  Very nice.  Can we go to –  It's supposed to be on Amazon, not on Nude Women.  Can we go to Amazon?  I'm sorry.  Because I'm going to make a bet with everybody in this room that we're going to go to Amazon  right now, and I would bet a lot of money that number 18 is not the latest new CD.  Yeah, let's see.  I am going to bet a lot of money, taking all bets at this point. 
[01:01:00]  Let's see.  Amazon.com.  Is it tracking on the top 20 list?  Danny.  Where's the top 20?  Yes.  Well, top 20 and a six on the end of it.  It's the – here, Amazon sales rank number 206 in music.  See bestsellers in music.  Why would they say 18 if it's –  Wait, wait.  Amazon sales rank is number 206?  Dude, they sell a lot of music, though. 
[01:01:30]  But it says –  So that's pretty good.  It says number 18 on Amazon's top 20.  Okay, maybe go to the music section.  Maybe it's like –  A subcategory?  Yeah, the subcategory.  Females?  No, no, no.  Lita Ford is the subcategory.  Maybe this week.  Connecticut has the subcategory.  It's the has-been corner category on Amazon.com.  Maybe it's hard rock and metal.  I hope they can't afford satellite.  All right.  Hard rock and metal.  Number 18?  No. 
[01:02:00]  Nickelback.  Nickelback's number 18?  Hard rock.  It's not even number 18 on the hard rock album?  Well, you have to go to another subcategory.  I found it.  No, no.  Here it is.  Where is it?  Now it's number 21 in the rock and metal category.  Okay.  That would be impressive, but I want to hear some of the bands that are above this album.  You got an album called War is the Answer, and that's by Five Finger Death Punch.  Okay.  I hear them.  I actually hear them on Octane.  Bob Seger's Greatest Hits, everyone.  Can't get enough of those. 
[01:02:30]  No, in what category?  Rock and metal.  Oh, rock and metal.  Okay.  Let's see.  Nickelback with Dark Horse.  Steel Panther.  All right.  Feel the Steel.  Steel.  Okay.  Something about Steel.  Pearl Jam, we know.  Max Baser.  Freely, we know.  Chevelle, we know a little bit.  Black Crows.  Black Crows have an album out?  I guess so.  It's probably without, what's his name?  Without Chris Robson.  Yeah.  I bet it.  I used to be a huge Black Crows fan.  I didn't even know they had an album out.  How lame am I with my Black Crow knowledge? 
[01:03:00]  Brand new Lynyrd Skynyrd, everyone.  I'm excited.  God and guns.  Daughtry.  Oh, Rodrigo and Gabriela.  Yeah.  Megadeth, which is actually pretty good.  The new Megadeth stuff is pretty sweet.  Three Days Grace, I know them a little bit.  Well, unfortunately, they're not coming in, Danny.  Sergeant Pepper.  Sergeant Pepper remastered, yeah.  All right.  Dear Agony by Breaking Benjamin.  White Album remastered is number five.  The Beatles.  Romstein.  Romstein.  Death of Bomb, two deluxe version. 
[01:03:30]  All right.  Death Clock is the only band that got famous from a cartoon.  And number one is what?  Alice in Chains.  Oh, all right.  Black gives way to blue.  Wow, that fucking...  So we have to change...  I was getting a lot of buzz.  We have to change this.  Yeah, that needs to be immediate.  We got to change this.  Change it.  Number 21 in the top 20.  21 in the top 20.  No, we can't be 21 in the top 20, though.  Just edging out Anvil.  And number 206 overall.  How about top 20 in the top 25? 
[01:04:00]  Top 25.  Number 21 in the top 25.  Now we have to say top 20.  Oh, our Lita Ford facts get better than that one, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  The research department was...  Amazing, Sam.  Amazing.  Lita was the lead guitarist for The Runaway.  She joined the band in 1975 at the age of 17.  You know, it's like she's been doing this forever.  Crazy.  She began her solo career in 1979.  Her first success came in 84 with the album Dancing on the Edge.  That's something you remember.  84? 
[01:04:30]  I was one.  You were one.  Really?  Yes.  She was reportedly asked...  This is very important, and we're going to get in depth with this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is something big.  She was reportedly asked to be on the seventh season of The Surreal Life in 2007.  She declined.  Yes.  Uh-huh.  So we're going to talk to her about that.  There is something to bring.  Maybe she watched...  You know something?  Did she regret?  Did she wish...  I hope we have enough time to cover that subject.  Yes.  She declined.  She did not do the series. 
[01:05:00]  That seems to be a smart move.  She didn't do the series.  No.  I would bet that The Surreal Life people have a different story.  She returned to music in 2008.  Her guitarist is Bumblefoot from Guns N' Roses.  Yeah, I mean, how does he work with it?  Isn't that the Harry Potter guy?  No, that's Dumbledore.  Oh!  See, I thought he was Bumblefoot.  No.  You're thinking of Dumbledore.  Oh, I'm sorry then.  Okay, my mistake.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Greg C. from Atlanta's got it.  She's the 18th most popular in the rock and roll cassette category. 
[01:05:30]  Okay.  I don't know what it says.  This was released on cassette.  No, the new Black Crow is getting some info, of course, as the Robinson Brothers.  Now, this is something I could sink my teeth in, Opie.  Apparently, she's in the new Jack Black video game, Brutal Legend.  And, you know, I'm a gamer.  And, boy, when I saw that game, I just had to run to the store.  Yeah.  You know what?  Brutal Legend, as discussed on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:06:00]  Pick up any other game.  That's awesome.  But, you know, Sam, technically, we were in Grand Theft Auto.  Of course.  Yeah, but this is not...  They told me I'm in it.  I've never found my part.  Top-selling games.  People are in these fucking video games.  Brutal Legend is...  Is there a review for Brutal Legend on there?  Probably.  Yeah, I would love to read one fucking review.  Remember how funny Jack Black was at the MTV Awards when he dressed up as the character  from Brutal?  I'll fucking kick you out of there.  I just want you...  What is wrong with you?  I really...  And I'll help.  Okay, I'm sorry. 
[01:06:30]  I swear to God.  I can't even go with that sarcastically.  Sorry.  I really can't.  You didn't like it.  No, I can't even go with it sarcastically, Sam.  Okay, well, you didn't like it.  Okay.  He just angers me.  He's another person that just angers me.  All right, well, you're not a fan.  Kind of used to be.  That's the sad part.  She was reportedly...  We'll do the rest of the Lita Ford facts, Sam, before we get to the Jim Gillette facts.  She was reportedly engaged to Tony Iommi in the 80s.  Reportedly.  Right?  So I guess we could ask her about that. 
[01:07:00]  What was it like?  Well, I know Jim...  Did he propose?  How did he propose?  Jim is a big fan.  Yeah.  You know, Tony...  And he's...  Oh, you mean Jim not here Norton?  Right.  He might be listening.  Who actually would have been, like, maybe excited to...  Yeah, Jim, the only one that might have cared.  Might have given a shit about this.  This happens more times than not.  People are booked on this program that Jimmy Norton would enjoy seeing, would probably be able to carry on a conversation with about maybe her duet with Ozzy, things like that. 
[01:07:30]  And just every fucking time they wind up coming here when Jim's not here.  And then we're saddled.  Saddled with the drivel.  Yeah, I guess I should tell you guys that I was supposed to be in the Surreal Life 7th season as well.  Which season?  7th.  7th?  Yeah.  Really? 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, I turned him down.  You turned him down?  Yeah.  You know what?  Really?  That is such a coincidence.  Do you know, I got a call back in 2007 from the people from Surreal Life.  Surreal Life.  And season 7 was coming up, and they wanted me to be on it, but you know what I did?  I declined.  What?  Why wouldn't you guys have done that?  That's not a big show, Sam.  Yeah.  I mean, it was big at the time.  Nah, it's not really a big show.  Wow.  It doesn't really put old celebrities back on the map or anything.  No, no.  I mean, it did that for, I thought it did. 
[01:08:30]  There is another rumor that we could talk about.  There is a, there's rumored to be a movie in production about her band, The Runaways.  That's right.  And this is a little additional information for you.  It's not on the one sheet because I was running out of space, but Taylor Scout Compton from  the Halloween series is supposedly playing Miss Ford, Miss Lita Ford.  Could I get a picture of her, please?  I'd love to see a picture of Taylor.  And finally, our Lita Ford info ends with this one.  And this is just amazing, and I can't wait to really get inside on this one. 
[01:09:00]  Yes, yes.  Kiss Me Deadly, her big song, right?  Yeah.  Kiss Me Once, Kiss Me Twice, Kiss Me Deadly, was covered by Real Big Fish.  What?  Yeah.  The band Real Big Fish.  Are you kidding?  So we're going to, maybe we can play both versions of stuff.  And that's something we can really.  Wrap our.  Oh, I'll serve something.  That's something you hate when you click on those Google images and you get that forbidden page  or something.  You need a better picture.  She's female. 
[01:09:30]  So she's got that going.  She's a nice girl.  Who's that?  Taylor Scout Compton.  I'm digging her.  And she is the movie that reports.  What show is that?  When was she a little girl?  She was really hot in that.  No.  No, I mean cute.  All right.  That's what I meant.  And there you go.  And then Jim Gillette, her husband's coming in.  And I don't know.  They have two kids.  And he's famous for being in the band Nitro.  And he trains MMA with the Gracie family. 
[01:10:00]  And he does a rock scream.  So.  Yeah.  Looking forward to the big Lita Ford and Jim Gillette interview.  Royce Gracie just got his own.  Hoist, by the way.  It's pronounced Hoist Gracie.  He just got his own action figure.  So maybe that's something you could say.  Jim Gillette would.  What?  You just threw out your one sheet.  Oh.  They're not even here yet.  I'm supposed to do that.  Yeah.  No.  This.  This is a nun sheet.  You know what?  I wasn't even doing that for the show.  You just threw it away.  You know how we try to be shocking because we're shock jocks.  I actually just didn't. 
[01:10:30]  You instinctually know it's garbage.  Like that wasn't even supposed to be on the air.  I was just throwing it away.  You just know it's garbage.  That's meant to be like bullet points you can glance at while the interview is going on.  And like no one was even supposed to notice that.  I was just like, all right, I don't need this.  Horrible.  Anthony, you want to do a little jocktober?  Please.  Happy jocktober, everybody, from your friends at the Opie and Anthony Show.  One third of the women polled said they do this right after a breakup.  My guess is tickle their clit with a rake. 
[01:11:00]  It's a celebration of craptastic radio from around this great nation of ours.  A little more specific.  That's pretty good.  That's the whole thing we did.  She looks like every actress who was like a really hot teenager who's battling cancer  later in life.  So turn up this turntacular radio.  It's jocktober on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Guys, I want to take the Jim Gillette, Lita Ford thing very seriously because we are professional  broadcasters.  So I really want some of the listeners, because I think this could be a really cool thing. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  I want listeners to come up with very famous rock screams from rock history, and I want  to see if Jim Gillette could imitate all these famous rock screams throughout rock history.  I'm getting one right here.  Highway Star.  Deep purple.  Highway Star would be a perfect one.  Yeah.  Perfect.  So you call up.  Hey, Jim Gillette, I hear you do a rock scream.  You know the one from Highway Star.  Yeah.  Could you imitate that?  I think that's the way to go with this thing. 
[01:12:00]  Rich Voss is here a half hour early, and he really thinks he's coming in studio.  What a sad, sad man.  What a sad, sad fucking man.  Are we doing the mispronunciation contest with him and Mars today?  Good.  All right.  Maybe he could do the rock scream of the woman after Arba Dwyer blew his brains out.  I don't know.  That's a great rock scream she does.  It's not classified as a rock scream.  No?  Yeah, no.  Oh.  Oh, you know what?  Good one, though.  There is an angle on... 
[01:12:30]  I heard Lita Ford and Jim Gillette are very filthy in bed.  Oh.  I did hear this.  I think they have a...  Like, literally?  I think they have a sex swing.  Dirty.  What?  Which is the most ridiculous thing ever.  A swing above the bed or something.  You know what?  That's so hack.  That's sexually hack.  A sex swing.  Oh, wow.  You're wild.  Stop it.  Unless there's a prolapsed asshole falling out of the bottom of it.  I don't mind a little...  They get bat around like a pinata.  I don't mind a little kink, but the sex swing is just ridiculous. 
[01:13:00]  You just gotta feel like an idiot in it.  You gotta feel like a dope sex swing.  Well, when your wife dresses up as a, you know, dominatrix, and now you have to be a bad boy.  Aren't you supposed to take the sex swing and the girl sits on it, right?  Yeah.  And then you stick your dick in her through the hole in the bottom and then spin her around?  I don't know what the fuck they do with these things.  Like, what does a spinning vagina feel like on your junk?  Might be interesting, but it's like so hack. 
[01:13:30]  It would be good for maybe two turns.  Yeah, a couple of twists.  Now you're just ripping internal organs to pieces.  Yeah, if things start drying up.  Yeah.  You know, then it turns into like an engine.  You need proper viscosity in your motor oil, or else you're gonna blow a bearing.  You got a smoking vagina.  Yeah.  You can't spin her around real fast.  All right, let's get into some Jocktober stuff.  You want Rich Voss in for the big Jocktober segment, Ant?  You could just stop after, do you want Rich Voss in?  All right, Rich. 
[01:14:00]  Hi, Rich.  You know when we tell you to come in at eight, that means come in at eight, right?  Well, first of all...  No first of all.  Oh, is that when the big hand is on the 12?  We're running a...  We're running a professional operation here.  Being at eight.  Somewhere.  Being at eight means you sit your ass in the fucking office for a half hour and have some coffee.  Oh, damn, Joe.  No, well, maybe I wanted to come in for Jocktober because I had some DJs call me yesterday because of your Jocktober.  All right?  Well, now look who's lighting up, okay?  Would we piss off? 
[01:14:30]  No, you would make people happy.  Oh.  Well, I got a call yesterday from Zito and Garrett outside of Fort Myers.  Zito and Garrett?  Yeah.  Are they cool?  You said nice things about them, but you were trashing...  Wait, we didn't say nice things about Zito and Garrett.  I don't even know who they are.  We didn't say nice things about anyone.  Never.  If they're a good young show, you know, good.  I'm all for it.  No, they're good.  The closest I came was I said I like Ziti yesterday.  Right.  Oh, that was it.  Well, but you...  We've turned the corner.  If there's young guys out there doing radio the right way, you know, I'm all for it.  Well, this is what I said to them. 
[01:15:00]  I said...  We just want to get rid of all the old fucking hack shows.  Well, they said you were trashing some guy down the hall they worked with, Big Mama.  And I said...  Oh, yeah.  And so they wanted me to comment on it.  And, of course, I trashed Big Mama, too.  Wait, you were down in Fort Myers?  No, they called me.  Oh, they called you on...  Okay.  They called me a character on their show?  No, I'm not a character.  Yeah, I'm a...  Are you having an affair with other radio shows?  Yeah.  Do you have a secret room where you're bringing all these other radio guys and having sex with? 
[01:15:30]  Well, first, I was on BJ last week.  Also, I did a phone-in yesterday with another guy from Seattle.  So, ZD and Garlic, are they good?  ZD and Garrett.  Oh, ZD and Garrett.  ZD and Garrett.  Yeah, they're funny.  You know what's good about them?  They know how to take a joke.  And I don't have to write down topics when I go in.  They just wing it.  How do you know if they know how to take a joke?  Because they keep calling.  See, that's an insult, Rich.  Oh, now, I get it.  I get it.  Well, you're on fire now. 
[01:16:00]  Look at that.  I guess...  I wish I was.  Be less painful than the fucking Lita Ford interview is going to be.  I guess you got besides the Girl Scout cookies.  Oh!  So, they called me, and I started smashing Big Mama, too, just because of the name Big  Mama.  Big Mama.  Anybody that goes by Big Mama.  Yeah.  Stop it.  And they said, well, Opie and Anthony compliment us.  And I'm thinking, well, who gives a fuck anyhow?  Like, Opie and Anthony are like, you know what I mean?  They're just two other fucking hacks in New York that cover it with hipsterness. 
[01:16:30]  You know what I mean?  So...  What's the name of the show?  I don't know what it is.  Oh, it's the ones that like Zito and Garrett.  Oh, okay.  Zito and Garrett.  Why?  I thought you said something else.  What do you think I said?  You thought there was a mistake there?  I thought you said Ziti and Garrett.  Oh, boy.  Big surprise that you might have a mistake.  Oh, okay.  From now on, only Opie and Anthony talk to me.  That's all I'm saying.  You can during a second break.  Okay. 
[01:17:00]  Okay.  Why is Sam sitting down?  I don't like how he's sitting here.  Who's running this place?  I don't like how he's sitting here.  Why are you sitting down, Sam?  We didn't invite you to the big table.  Like he's the third guy.  Like he...  Okay.  No.  You stand until we get into your segment.  You know what he said a second ago?  Thank you.  He said, we didn't compliment Zito and Garrett.  He did say we, right?  I know.  He's a fucker.  But you know what?  Listen to me.  You've got to work for us for 10 years before you get to say we.  I know.  How many are you up to?  Five?  Four?  Danny's up to five.  I know that much.  Four.  Four.  You got six years to go before you start using that wee shit. 
[01:17:30]  Do you get along with the Linguini and Clam Sauce show?  What are you kidding me?  Do you get along with them?  Yeah.  They're the best.  I like the week when they do red clam sauce.  Yeah, it's all.  That's the best.  That's once a month.  I don't know Ziti and Garrett.  I only know, I only know, I don't know, just a couple other radio shows.  That's it.  Well, BJ, I did last week.  Ziti.  Ziti?  Ziti.  Zito and Garrett.  I didn't even mean to do that.  But it's so easy to just say Ziti.  Sorry.  Sorry to Zito. 
[01:18:00]  Okay.  I know BJ Shea.  I know Brother Weese.  I did him a couple weeks ago.  I know Shred and Reagan.  Oh, my God.  Did we go at it?  He is really, really passionate about his politics.  Shred?  No, no.  Oh, Reagan.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no, no.  Not Reagan.  What do you call it?  Brother Weese.  Oh, Weese.  Yeah.  Oh, liberal.  Weese is a hardcore liberal.  Oh, what a lib.  Oh, it was beyond lib.  Yeah, yeah.  He made Kunstler look conservative.  Yeah, he is way the hardcore liberal.  He gets crazy.  He cut my mic off.  That's how crazy.  Wow. 
[01:18:30]  That's how he did it.  He goes.  He cut it off.  Holy shit.  When we hang, we don't talk much politics.  Like, I just can't go there.  But he, that's his passion.  Passion.  Unbelievable.  By the way, a big congratulations, Brother Weese, and nominated to the Radio Hall of Fame  yesterday or the day before.  Oh, where is that?  Cooperstown?  He's going in with Harry Harrison.  Oh, Harry Harrison.  He's going in with a guy that is as good as a jukebox.  No respect for those old guys that just played songs. 
[01:19:00]  That was Antoine.  Who gives a shit?  Did you just say a jukebox?  A jukebox.  You jukebox.  They made boxes out of us, too?  Oh, God.  They made boxes out of us?  So, anyhow, Zito and Garrett, they're funny guys, okay?  You know what I mean?  That's fine.  I'm not even going to tell you the funny guys.  I just don't know who they are.  I'll tell you some of them.  You know, you ask.  Without any question, the Sports Junkies, good radio.  I like those guys. 
[01:19:30]  BJ, great radio.  Bob Rivers, good radio in Seattle.  I did a call yesterday with him.  Bob Rivers is not good radio.  No, he is.  No, and I know you agree with us, and for some reason you can't say it because you probably  do very well in Seattle.  He puts asses in seats.  Bob Rivers sucks a dick.  Him and his dumb song parodies.  He did song?  He didn't do song parodies.  Oh, he finally decided to stop?  Thank God.  He was the song parody king.  Oh, really?  They love him in Seattle.  Bob Rivers blows. 
[01:20:00]  Well, Rich Voss didn't say that.  What do you like about Bob Rivers there, Rich Voss?  What do I like about Bob Rivers?  He's, with me, he's free.  You spineless fuck.  What do you like about him?  He's free-flowing with me.  Uh-huh.  And, you know what?  With me, he likes me, so I like him.  What do you like about his show when you're listening to it?  Well, I like the guy.  There was one guy in there doing really, really funny Woody Allen impressions, and you would  look at him.  You wouldn't think he could do Woody Allen impressions.  I mean, don't worry. 
[01:20:30]  You guys, to me, you guys.  All right, Rich.  Stop kissing our ass.  Wow.  No, I wasn't kidding.  We know we're great.  Sparks flying off the locomotive wheels.  We know we're great.  Everyone knows we're great.  Huh?  Nothing.  You heard me.  I didn't hear what you said.  No.  So, Big Muff.  I was thinking that I can't believe he's not sick this week.  I'm looking.  I am.  You look healthy.  I am, though.  You are sick?  From fucking Bob Kelly. 
[01:21:00]  Stupid Bob Kelly.  Wow, you watch his act somewhere?  Not his stomach.  I got the fucking trout flu when we went fucking fly fishing.  You went fly fishing.  And you got sick?  I got a heavy cold.  I'm just about done with it.  Just about.  You could have played back page with us this morning.  I know.  That would be cool.  92, folks.  With a triple, two triples and three doubles.  How many fake lost balls?  Nothing.  You can ask.  How many fucking mulligans?  I don't cheat because I put it into my handicap.  Okay.  Did you take your big tooth mulligan? 
[01:21:30]  No, I didn't take my big tooth mulligan.  I want my golf club back.  I've never played with a golfer before.  He goes, well, I have big teeth, so I'm going to take a mulligan on this shot.  What?  What the fuck?  I made everybody's sandwiches.  I bought three.  I also, in my bag, have my MRI of my brain because I thought I had a tumor.  I went for an MRI last week in Seattle.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Did you get a discount?  In the brain, you could see the stuff's turning.  The fucking hamster on the wheel?  What can you see?  What kind of surprise were you when you found out you had a brain? 
[01:22:00]  Exactly.  See, you know what?  That's the problem.  Because Bob Edwards doesn't treat me this way.  Wait, was that his name?  Bob Edwards?  Bob Rivers?  Oh, Rivers.  The NPR guy?  Move over a little bit.  I like to look the person in the eye when I beat the shit out of him.  Always look high.  Hey, I'm going to want to see that MRI.  It's got to be a treat.  We miss you, Rich.  We got some new competition.  You took on Bobo last time.  Today, you're taking on Mars in a mispronunciation contest. 
[01:22:30]  Really?  Yeah.  You might beat this one.  Why don't we do a contest on my fucking abs?  Oh, God.  Stop.  That was the gavest thing I've ever seen him on.  Why are you so gay?  You just be cum on your fucking stomach hair.  Let's walk.  Why don't you just shave down?  Let's walk the people through this.  You needed to show a room full of guys your abs.  Danny's uncomfortable like I am.  Right, Danny?  Yeah.  What is that supposed to do?  Hey, what's that supposed to do? 
[01:23:00]  Yes.  It builds up confidence and self-esteem.  It builds up my confidence.  Danny is so douched out right now.  It's so bad.  I'm like, what does that mean?  Let's have a contest about my abs.  He lifts his shirt up, and we all were just looking like,  We all had the Beavis and Butthead face.  Yeah, we had the Butthead face where he just looked and went,  What, you want us to get hard?  What were you expecting?  Like, wow.  It just means nothing.  I don't know.  I just do that every now and then.  It just comes across to do it.  You know, when you have cancer, you look good at first 
[01:23:30]  before you start losing too much weight.  Oh, God.  Who has cancer?  You really get abs.  Oh, yeah.  You get the abs.  You get some fine muscle tone.  No, they said it was completely clear.  No shit.  Yeah.  From one ear to the other.  Completely empty.  They just can look through.  You know, they brought me into the radiology room,  and I said, you know, because I think it was,  because I hit my head so it was like post-dramatic,  you know, some type of post-dramatic thing.  All right, yeah.  Post-dramatic.  Post-dramatic.  God damn, I hate that post-dramatic. 
[01:24:00]  Post-dramatic.  That's scary shit.  No, you got it right.  And they brought me into the radiology room,  and I'm looking at my brain on the things,  and I'm looking at it like,  it's like me opening the trunk of a car going,  I'm going, what the fuck?  Like, I'm so, oh, yeah, that looks good.  Well, there was fucking cabbage in there, too.  Lingy-longy.  Jesus, you got a good memory.  I remember that.  Keith J. from Niagara Falls has named your abs.  Rich Voss has guar abs.  He painted them on.  What do we got?  We got Bob Rivers' big hit? 
[01:24:30]  Really?  This was his, uh...  This is the radio stylings of Bob Rivers in Seattle.  He's got a high voice.  Push your charge card to the limit. 
[01:25:00]  All right, enough.  I do remember that stuff.  Every radio show in America plays his Christmas stuff.  Oh, really?  Did he get residuals?  Does he?  Yeah.  I don't know how that shit works.  What do I know?  I don't know.  All I know is Anthony owes me a box of golf balls.  Why?  Oh, I got golf balls at home for you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because we made a bet on something,  and we bet he lost. 
[01:25:30]  No, a fan of Rich Voss's gave me a box of golf balls  to give to Rich.  Cool.  All right, Rich.  And I haven't given them to him.  I hear you.  They're right there.  They're actually on top of all of my bills,  which I paid last night, finally.  You have bills?  Yeah.  You do it?  I pay my bills.  You pay them?  I pay my bills.  So Keith got fired?  No, Keith never paid my bills.  I pay all my bills myself.  When I used to remodel houses.  Oh, God.  We were putting a door. 
[01:26:00]  That was called robbery.  It's not remodeling a house.  You were burglarizing them.  We were doing these, putting a door up,  and this old black drunk couple, right?  And I mean, this guy, they were just Thunderbird drinkers,  and it was an old black man, right?  So we heard an argument as we're putting a door up,  and all of a sudden, the guy comes walking out  with blood dripping down his head,  and she hit him with a hammer, right?  And he's sitting on the porch, bleeding, going, 
[01:26:30]  I paid my rent today.  Right?  Like he was so drunk before.  That's when we packed the tools.  Yeah, no kidding.  Our work here is done.  All right, Rich, we're going to take a break,  because we just did a little get-to-know-you segment here.  We're going to do Jacktober after the break,  and then you can sit down, Sam.  Oh, great.  Rich Voss performing Friday.  Dawn day.  Friday, October 10th, doesn't make sense. 
[01:27:00]  Tomorrow's the 9th, whatever, okay.  Friday and Saturday, Bananas in Hasbrook Heights, right?  No, no, no, Friday's in Manville.  We're doing a fundraiser for cops at Rhythms in Manville.  Oh, okay, so Friday, all right, let's start over.  Rich Voss, Friday, Rhythms, what's that?  It's just, it's like a rock club, I think,  but they're doing a fundraiser for-  For a cop?  Well, cops are a cop, yeah.  Awesome.  You don't even know for what?  Yeah, that's great.  Well, because they told me for the cop,  you know, I do a lot of cop fundraisers, so.  All right.  I don't, I've done, this is like my third one. 
[01:27:30]  Well, that's good that you do that.  Yeah.  In Manville, New Jersey,  and then Saturday, Bananas in Hasbrook Heights, New Jersey, right?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Quick break, and we'll do a little Jocktober,  and then the big Rita Ford and Jim Gillette interview  is about an hour out.  Opie and Anthony.  Goodbye.  Opie and Anthony, Rich Voss,  getting ready to do a little Jocktober.  Love Jocktober.  Sam, sit down.  Oh, thank you.  Wow.  Enjoy the seat at the big boys' table.  The big table.  Look at that.  Get comfortable.  You need anything?  Pull up a microphone and have fun. 
[01:28:00]  This is nice.  Just relax and have some fun.  All right.  Oh, there's the girl.  Does she have the right, there's the girl.  Does she have the right clothes on to make the video today?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is that a sweater, though?  Look how they run block on her, though.  She was hot.  Yeah.  No shit.  Please.  Who was she?  That's Nicole from the Morning Mashup.  It's the girl that when every morning she walks by here,  we go, oh, my God, she's hot.  And she looks in here.  Yeah.  Like, no one knows.  Well, she wants a little approval.  Oh, she knows.  She knows. 
[01:28:30]  We're big stars.  Wait till you see them walk back,  then you get to see her, you know, tits.  Her bosoms.  Her heavy bosoms.  As hot as she is,  after laying in bed with her for a month,  and she bites into an apple,  you want to put an ice pick in her skull.  Bites into an apple?  I'm just hearing the voice, the chewing.  Is that bugging you?  You were bitching about chewing?  All the things you could bitch about?  You're just amazing.  Bonnie's sitting there going,  when he straps on the feed bag and starts eating those oats. 
[01:29:00]  I completely understand the concept and the bit he was going for.  Your example is always the worst.  The other morning we woke up,  and I guess I was grunting.  I got up, and she goes,  can you please just leave?  Oh, wow.  So things are working out well at the boss' household.  And she goes,  did I tell you to leave?  I go, yeah.  She goes,  you make too many noises.  Really?  You're a noisy sleep guy.  I guess I know when I get up.  I'm a grunter.  Yeah.  It's called being an old Jew.  Maybe he's just got whatever Carl has. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  You need a compliment?  No compliments?  Why?  One came in over the phone?  Yeah, you need one?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Give me a little one.  A little compliment for Rich Voss here.  Scott in Cleveland.  Scott.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I want to say I saw Rich Voss in Cuyahoga Falls.  He couldn't even pronounce it.  Do you remember that, Rich?  Well, why would I want to pronounce it? 
[01:30:00]  What, Falls?  You killed, though.  I will say that.  You killed.  You did good.  Thank you.  Rich is amazing.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Yes, very funny.  Rich does a very, very good job.  Thank you, Rode.  And he does a good job for us,  just in a different way.  You're like our play thing.  Wow.  It's like having a little kitten  and working his abs again.  Oh, I just ate.  I've got to wait a few.  Do you have the audio of him  showing his abs out of nowhere?  Please, Travis, if you will.  One second. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, one second.  Let's see the context.  Yeah.  Which was none.  Is he ready?  Travis is on the spot.  Travis, you ready?  Why don't we do a connection?  We might have finally got...  I got my fucking abs.  My fucking abs.  Then he dramatically lifts his shirt off.  Jesus Christ.  I got to get in the couch.  I got an audition today for 30 Rock.  For real? 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Really?  Oh, please get that.  Please get that.  I love that show.  I'm just kidding.  What are you trying out for?  Or I'll tell you if you have a good shot at it.  A Yachov jewelry store owner.  The Nubian Explosion.  The Nubian Bing Explosion jewelry store.  Yachov.  I hope they don't want an accent.  I hope they want a slur and a slobber.  Louis beans.  Oh, no.  So you got to play a jeweler? 
[01:31:30]  Well, I guess.  You know, a hip-hop jewelry store.  Oh, oh, okay.  What's your racial background supposed to be?  Well, Yachov, I wouldn't think...  Like a Russian kind of...  Yeah, Russian.  Russian.  Yachov, you know.  Yeah.  But I'm playing it as a guy from Jersey that married into the family.  I hope that's what they want.  No, I don't know.  I'm playing. 
[01:32:00]  I'm going over the lines.  Okay, you can leave.  I'm going over the lines.  Can I call her in and talk to her?  Turn your head.  Yeah, turn your head.  Turn your head.  Turn your head.  There she is.  She's got a coffee cup.  She's holding a coffee cup.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  It's the morning mash-up.  Yay, the morning mash-up.  They don't have time for us?  What?  Dropping low?  I can't.  We were enjoying your video.  I'm glad.  I'm glad everybody got a good laugh. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, well, laugh is one way to put it.  Okay.  Extremely turned on another.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Why doesn't Sam explain like he explained to us before the show?  We'll see how brave Sam really is.  Well, I was just...  We were watching the video, and I was theorizing as to whether or not you were aware that there  would be a high percentage of men that would be sitting in their computer chairs completely  nude, masturbating, watching your video.  That's what I brought up. 
[01:33:00]  I mean, if I were to attempt to, on purpose, turn you on, that would not be the way that  I would go about it.  I would not try to drop it low.  You know what it is, though?  Well, show Rich.  Show Rich the video.  All right, here it is.  It's playing.  I'm just looking at her live.  What is this called?  Drop it low?  You know that song, Drop it Low?  See, Mina knows how to drop it low.  I really don't.  Well, it's like a booty dance, but I don't really have a booty, and I'm up.  Now, see, you're doing this move that, like...  The pelvis thrust.  Yeah, yeah.  It's the pelvis thrust.  But in doing that, you can kind of picture things. 
[01:33:30]  Like sexual activity.  Okay.  That or an epileptic fit.  Exactly.  That's what I thought it was more like.  That or a Puerto Rican girl that grew up in a white neighborhood.  Yeah.  I'm clearly not Puerto Rican, because a Puerto Rican girl would know what she was doing.  Yeah.  Yeah, I thought that was...  The video is...  Well, I'm glad you guys enjoyed it.  It's good.  The video is really hot right now.  Let me in with them.  I'm Rich Voss.  I don't know if you know me. 
[01:34:00]  Hi.  Seem to be divorced.  Big comic.  All right.  Big comic.  I'm a big radio star.  Big radio star.  What I'm saying is, I don't know if you feel the connection when you walk down the hall  and my back was turned to you.  It was there.  Yeah.  You and me.  I'm just saying, at any point you get a flash of low self-esteem or you want to get even  with somebody, Rich Voss, I'm the guy you look up.  Cool.  All right.  Thank you.  And you can bring the background singers with you, too.  I don't care.  Thank you.  That's the rest of the morning mashup.  You need to cut that shit with the background singers.  That's what I'm saying.  Oh, shit.  Don't have me get all black up in here. 
[01:34:30]  First of all, Redbone.  Let me explain something.  You're too light-skinned.  Did you call me Redbone?  Did you call me Redbone?  Oh, shit.  I'm going to pull that tattoo over your freaking head.  You're allowed to curse here.  No, no.  I'm not going to.  I just want to say this.  I love the ONA show.  Thank you, sir.  I'm glad you're feeling better, Anthony, because I looked the other day.  Obie was lost.  I'll see you cats later.  All right.  There goes Stanley from the morning mashup.  Morning mashup.  Morning mashup.  Redbone.  Love the morning mashup.  Stanley T. was like a famous guy before. 
[01:35:00]  Really?  He had a TV show.  No way.  Get the fuck out of here.  In Philly, yeah.  If you look it up on YouTube, he had a song and everything.  Like a Scorch show?  No, like a TV show.  He knows Boyz II Men and Chris Rock and all these people.  He was in the Motown Philly video.  That's not his girl, is it?  Stanley T. in the house.  What do you think of her?  She's pretty.  He's pretty hot.  You know, for entertainment.  He's pretty hot.  Did you just say he's pretty hot?  He's pretty hot.  No, you just said.  I'm a hot man.  I'll bet you.  You said he's pretty hot.  Travis.  Travis.  Travis.  You're going to need that line.  Go on this one. 
[01:35:30]  I said she's making the gum.  You absolutely said.  I guarantee.  He's pretty hot.  He's pretty hot.  Well, it's going to take him a second to find it.  There's Stanley T. being famous in Philly.  With the fade.  You got to hear the theme song to his show.  And Piggy says it would be a great idea if I could do a show for Manita's house.  Something.  I'm Stanley T.  Stanley T. in the house.  Great idea for a new TV show.  See you already?  I'm ready.  I'm in the house.  Let's go.  Oh, damn.  Is this a kid's show?  No.  I'm in the house.  Parents just don't understand. 
[01:36:00]  Parents just don't understand.  What year was this?  1994.  1994.  Yeah.  It looks like the beginning of Living Color.  Yeah.  I'm mad at Santa.  Why?  They're trying to bring all this black culture to our show.  We're not buying it.  And it's so unrealistic because none of the windows were boarded up in the house.  Oh, rich.  Rich.  Rich.  Rich.  Rich.  That's really. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at that.  You're in the house.  In the house.  Stanley T. in the house.  In the house.  So he.  What did he do?  In the house.  He brought.  He went to this.  Oh, that's like in the house.  That's the project.  Now we're talking.  But then he.  What's this?  A home invasion caught on video?  Looks like a scene from The Wire.  I'm waiting for Marlo.  I'm waiting for Marlo to come out.  That's Stanley T. now.  Come on.  From the morning mashup.  Oh.  He just knocked on the door.  A woman answered the door and freaked out.  I paid my rent today. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  She said it.  Oh, my God.  I guess he was famous, huh?  He did afternoon radios.  They call this something out on the website I go to.  Something out.  14 kids just came running down the stairs.  Come on, Daddy.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  This is my nightmare right here.  This would be my nightmare if that was my front door.  Stanley's in the house.  He's just looking through the windows and turning the knob. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, shit.  There would be, like, three blasts of a .45 coming right through that.  Is that really a kid she's just bouncing around with?  Yeah.  Stanley's in the house.  Wait a second.  The kid just gave birth.  It looks like a conjoined twin.  Is that an extra head?  Oh, shit.  Oh, God damn.  All right.  And what's that now?  What do we got?  A little kid there.  Another kid over there.  Why is everyone home?  Why aren't they at work?  Because Stanley's in the house.  Oh, because Stanley's in the house. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, they took the day off.  Oh, look at that.  Stanley was coming in the house.  Look at him.  There's four kids holding up a table.  Fuck.  That's good.  This is called...  Is this Stanley's segment called Casing the Joint?  No.  Oh, okay.  I thought he was going to choke you out, Rich.  What's that?  I thought he was going to choke you out.  Why?  You called him red bone.  That means light skinned.  Yeah.  I know what red bone means.  We know what racist terminology is here.  Well, because he was acting like a thug, but he wasn't dark enough to be a thug. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, shit.  What?  I'm going to tell Stanley that when he walks by next.  Boys to men showed up.  What is that?  Although your backup singer line was, you know, one for the ages.  What's that big thing there in the room?  It's a telephone.  No, not that.  That other thing that he was leaning on, yo.  The government.  That's good.  God damn, Rich Ross.  It's so much fun to make fun of black people.  Oh, shit, Rich. 
[01:39:00]  Wow.  Jesus, Rich.  Let's go home.  We can go home now.  Let's call 1-800-839-HOUSE.  I think that number's probably...  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Stanley's in the house is not still in production.  That's different.  Now he's just a sidekick to the hot piece of ass.  He's not a...  He's one of the co-hosts.  I think that goes to a carpet store where you leave a message for the future.  12 Monkeys?  No?  I get it.  All right.  Thank you. 
[01:39:30]  He's a co-host of the Morning Mission.  What is that thing?  It's like a dialysis machine in their fucking living room.  What is that?  I don't know.  Stanley's in the house.  Some kind of furniture that is alien to me.  Why don't we move on to J-Tuber.  Jack.  The in-the-house talk line now directs you to call another number to get, like, hot talk.  Oh, really?  Nice.  Oh, like sex talk?  They didn't say specifically.  Did Rich say he's hot?  I think we have the clip.  Oh, let's listen. 
[01:40:00]  Stanley T in the house.  What do you think?  All right, she's pretty.  He's pretty hot.  You know, for me to say.  You go, she's pretty hot.  Do it again.  Listen carefully.  You go, she's pretty hot.  If you listen carefully, you know you're wrong on this one.  All right, one more time.  Listen one more time.  Pretty.  He's pretty hot.  He's pretty hot.  Rewind it one more time.  Do it again.  Pretty.  He's pretty hot.  You say he's pretty hot. 
[01:40:30]  You can't hear the S because it's blocked by the gum.  Yeah, that'll get you out of your homosexuality.  Bonnie, I was chewing gum.  We're so immature here.  She slips up, even if it did say easy.  Fuck it.  You said it, so it's true.  What, do you want to go talking?  How old are we, really?  Time for Jocktober, Ant.  Yes, I love Jocktober.  Sam, who did you bring to the table today? 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, what show is featured on today's Jocktober?  Well, today we're going all the way to Portland, Oregon.  Wow, Portland, Oregon.  To listen to Lee and Alana on KUPL Couple.  Couple.  Yes.  On the couple.  Bringing you some of today's best country hits.  Ah.  I did a phone-in with them.  Of course you did.  You've probably been on every radio show ever, ever.  Did you do them?  I was in Portland.  On a country station?  Yeah, they called me on the golf course when I was up in Portland. 
[01:41:30]  I was playing one day.  I'm pretty short.  And it was just horrific.  Ew.  Who is that?  Who's Lee?  Alana, we know, is the middle.  She looks like a house frow.  I believe Lee is the older gentleman.  Lee is the older gentleman with the very round Charlie Brown head, the pure white Captain  Kangaroo beard mustache thing.  And I'm not positive on what the young guy's name is, but he's just kind of there to bring  it all back around for the younger people.  Mix it up a little, bring some younger demos into the- 
[01:42:00]  Try to bring the youth in.  That's why we have you, Sam.  Yeah, exactly.  That's your role.  It's like all family.  Yeah.  It's Lee and Alana and then their child, whoever the fuck that is.  All right, let's get right into this.  Lee and Alana sweeper that describes them to a tee.  Yeah, I figured, you know.  Lee and Alana in the morning.  Your missile defense system to protect you from boring morning radio.  98.7.  GPL.  GPL.  Your missile defense system to protect you from morning- 
[01:42:30]  No, from boring morning radio.  Boring morning.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Then a nice jingle.  Yeah.  Wow.  And I like the lasers.  Good use of lasers.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Lots of lasers.  I like their lasers.  Lasers are important.  Lee and Alana give the daily poll results and the best comment of the morning.  Wait, wait, poll results?  Mm-hmm.  Another show that does a poll every morning.  Well, what they do, they have kind of stepped into what I call the future.  They have an internet website. 
[01:43:00]  What?  What is that?  It's very complicated.  We'll get into it in the technology segment.  I heard about that.  It's like it shows up on your TV screen.  No, it's the computer screen.  Oh, oh.  Your PC.  All righty.  And they ask a question.  They type a question on their website and allow people to interact by answering.  And they'll kind of give the results of what the people said on the internet website as well as the best comment of the morning.  Best comment of the morning.  Funniest. 
[01:43:30]  It's almost like line of the day.  Exactly.  Lee and Alana in the morning.  Your missile defense system to protect you from boring, boring radio.  98.7.  KUPL.  KUPL.  Nice.  I like that.  I like that.  Boring.  Boring.  I just want to dance with you.  Cha, cha, cha.  Cha, cha, cha.  That is right.  George Strait with Lee and Alana in the morning in New Country 98.7 KUPL.  I just want to dance with you. 
[01:44:00]  It's 8.40 and it's time.  You guys want to play What's Wrong With His Mouth?  Wow, man.  We got a quick sweeper on D-Boy.  What's wrong with his mouth?  Cha, cha, cha.  Is it dentures?  What's going on with his mouth?  It doesn't sound like he's talking over his mouth.  There's dentures.  My stroke.  There's something going on.  There is something.  There's something small to dance with you.  Cha, cha, cha.  Cha, cha, cha.  That is right.  George Strait with Lee and Alana in the morning in New Country 98.7 KUPL. 
[01:44:30]  I just want to dance with you.  It's 8.40 and it's time for the Lee and Alana Daily Poll question results.  That's right.  We were asking you about NASA semi-poll.  Fucking NASA semi-poll.  You're a boy.  You're a boy.  That's right.  He sounds like he's getting over a broken jaw.  His first day back after a broken jaw. 
[01:45:00]  Can you imagine standing at the altar with her going, did I just say yes?  I do.  I do, Rich.  I wrote my own vows.  Oh, what a voice on that one.  That's right.  That's right.  I promise to love, honor, and cherish.  She's a cold case file in 20 years.  Cold case.  Are you trying all your new material?  No.  It's working.  Watch this.  It's really good stuff.  None of it was material.  I like the new stuff, Rich.  Forensic consumers. 
[01:45:30]  I'll tell you some new material later.  All right.  Poll question results.  That's right.  We were asking you about NASA sending a $79 million missile to the moon.  They want to shoot our moon, not out of the sky, but they just want to shoot it and see what kind of kicks up, whether it be water or ice or dust or Neil Armstrong or any of those things.  So we wanted to know at KUPL.com, what did you think would come out of it?  The first question we asked was, what's your gut?  Do you think they're going to find water on the moon in like two?  Holy shit. 
[01:46:00]  Wow.  That's a poll.  The poll question.  What do you think?  Holy shit.  Yeah.  What do you think they're going to find?  They'll find water on the moon faster than they'll find humor in that studio.  It's devoid of humor.  They want to drop the bomb in the studio, see what kicks up, and check it for humor.  And they said Neil Armstrong?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He came back, remember?  Yeah, I know.  It's not still there.  The joke would be maybe something Neil Armstrong left behind, like a doody or something.  Yeah, Neil Armstrong's something. 
[01:46:30]  Whoa, Opie, whoa.  Oh, dude.  Ew.  Oh, Opie, now.  Now.  Ew.  That wasn't good, guys.  Well, here's the thing.  What happened?  If somebody cut that into just a quick sound bite, and they go, you know, he just found his doody.  His doody.  They find Neil Armstrong's doody or a load that he left.  Well, how about, yeah.  No one knows he jacked off on the moon.  How about the towel he wiped Buzz Armstrong's back with?  Yeah.  Buzz Armstrong.  I love how we.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:47:00]  Buzz Armstrong?  Whatever.  Yeah, of course, whatever.  You're right.  Buzz Lightyear.  Yeah, right.  You mean Buzz Aldrin.  Oh.  Armstrong.  You know what I was talking about?  Yeah.  Of course I did, because I realized how badly you fucked up the name.  I'm in that same category.  I say that a lot, too.  You know what I'm talking about.  Buzz Armstrong.  I love how we expect safe radio to be as edgy as us.  It's like, they're not going to be doing cum jokes.  Of course not.  They're part of Jack Tolbert. 
[01:47:30]  We're mad because they're not doing cum and doody jokes.  Stretch Armstrong.  All right, here we go.  PL.com.  What did you think would come out of it?  The first question we asked was, what's your gut?  Do you think they're going to find water on the moon?  And like, two or three people don't think so.  The best comment of the morning goes to Diane, who said, they're going to find Bigfoot and  his little green alien wife and long green hair children, and they're probably going  to be singing, it's five o'clock somewhere.  That's the best comment?  And that's what they laughed at?  Holy shit.  Number one joke of the morning. 
[01:48:00]  That's line of the day.  No way.  This is garbage.  This is garbage.  That's line of the day.  That was the funniest answer they got from their callers was, you know what, Bigfoot  and an alien monster and the green and they're singing.  They need somebody from the show Heroes that has a power to walk in that studio and make  it funny.  More new material.  It's terrific.  That was, I just came out of my head.  Okay, I used that one before once.  You're updating yourself. 
[01:48:30]  You're a pop culture comic now.  I love it.  Wait a minute.  Cracker.  You're looking like, I like that natural, more natural look.  She looks good.  You're just lonely.  That ship has sailed.  More natural look there with the darker hair.  That girl's pretty.  There's something about that.  That actress.  That's a guy.  Rich.  Who's that actress?  That actress?  You out of your mind?  You don't think she's good looking?  Yeah, he's hot.  What do you think of him?  You think he has good abs, Rich?  I think she's.  Yeah. 
[01:49:00]  Please, look how old and wrinkly.  He looks like he looked into the arc.  Oh, shit.  That's not a TV.  Oh, she's Michelle Monaghan.  Monaghan.  Michelle Trucker?  What's that about?  Trucker.  She definitely listens to you guys then.  She's all right.  Oh, she's very pretty.  All right, why don't we go, why don't we move on with Alana?  Lee and Alana do some hilarious Canadian accents.  I love Canadian accents.  Hey, who doesn't love doing that?  Rich loves Canadian accents.  It's a lot of fun.  Anthony loves Canadian accents. 
[01:49:30]  It's so fun to joke about.  Not so much.  Eh.  You just got to go, eh?  That's all you do is go, eh?  Oh, yeah.  Hey, I'm at work, eh?  Eh?  You know how they are.  Is that funny?  Eh?  Is that what we get, A's?  Is that what we're going to get a lot of, eh?  Well, maybe they could teach you a thing or two about Canadian accents.  All right.  Well, this is a learning experience.  Let me listen.  Lee and Alana.  New Country 98.7 KUPL.  Love Story from Taylor Swift.  8.59 with Lee and Alana in the morning.  And we just heard from Carl Nobis. 
[01:50:00]  He's been up at the zoo giving away tickets to Where the Wild Things Are.  Our sneak preview on Monday night.  Ah, see?  Where the Wild Things Are.  I'd love to be in that meeting with a fucking machine gun.  And the second the PD said, we got a Where the Wild Things Are giveaway for the movie that's coming out.  And guess who we're giving them away?  The zoo.  Oh, shit.  Because that's where the Wild Things Are.  Put the gun away.  Put the gun away!  That's why you get the big bucks, sir. 
[01:50:30]  Ah!  Are you at our sales meetings?  Oh, really?  You guys could pitch this stuff?  I would assume, based on the other things that I've heard that are not on the CD,  that the deal probably was that they said that this guy is where the Wild Things Are.  If you can figure out where he is and find him, you can get tickets to the free...  The Bronx?  Oh.  I hope you meant the Bronx Zoo.  Yeah!  That's what I meant, of course.  Sam.  I just want to make sure. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, I'm sorry.  I was inappropriate.  How dare you, Sam?  How dare you ever call me gay?  You just went, like that, Sam.  You did the gayest motion.  That's just like showing your abs and saying, he is hot.  You're right, Rich.  You're right.  It's a joke.  Jesus.  Yes, I'm a flaming homo.  No, you're not.  Okay.  That's isolated.  Save that clip.  Can we move on with this fine show?  Yes.  I want to hear the Canadian accent.  So do I.  Tickets to where the wild things are, our sneak preview on Monday night. 
[01:51:30]  He called to, as the Canadians would say, tell us he is out.  Out?  He's out.  Out?  No more tickets.  He's out.  What a boat if I want to go to the wild things.  New Country 98.7 King.  Another example of a male jock wanting to punch his co-host.  Oh, I got to hear that.  Can I please hear that again?  I love, I love how it's so unfunny.  He gives the chuckle and then just right back to the fucking music. 
[01:52:00]  He's out.  Out?  No more tickets.  He's out.  What a boat if I want to go to the wild things.  New Country 98.7 King.  You just don't stop laughing like that.  Oh, God.  That is horrible.  That was supposed to be Canadian?  A boat?  Out?  What if I went to the...  Out?  It sounded like a Norwegian with Down syndrome.  Yeah, that was really bad.  It wasn't Canadian at all.  Not at all.  Where and the... 
[01:52:30]  That was more Canadian.  Even he knew to punch out of that and just fucking get back to the country music.  You guys want to hear more?  Oh, please.  Lee and Alana?  Yeah.  He's saying Lonnie or something like that, though.  Is that a little pet name he has for her?  Oh, Lonnie.  He might call her Lonnie.  You never know.  Sometimes I feel like they're married.  Yeah, I know.  That's great.  All right, well, they talk to a caller.  Well, they have phone topics. 
[01:53:00]  A good morning show knows how to talk to their callers.  Yes.  About what people do to look cool, but in the end they look dorky.  And then Lonnie.  I feel like I could call her Lonnie now.  We know her a little bit.  Flies off the handle.  What?  Well, that's the thing.  She gets a little wild.  She's got a little sass about it.  What, is she on her period?  Whoa.  Oh, please.  I don't think that's been seen in a while.  Was she bleeding from her cunt?  Oh, come on.  See, I could be crazy. 
[01:53:30]  The old last egg is dropped on that one, I think.  You think?  Oh, yeah.  Susie, what do you think?  Mid-life crisis sports cars.  Yes.  You don't think that makes them look cool?  No.  Oh, they can't handle the power.  Have you ever been beaten?  Ah-ha.  They're talking about Anthony.  Ah-ha.  What is this old dried-up cunt saying?  What was the concept?  The things that people do that they think looks cool, but really just makes them look like 
[01:54:00]  a big dork.  Wow.  You know, your Mustang, your Mustang GT, you got it?  That actually makes you look shorty.  It's a Shelby GT500, which is a Super Snake.  Now it's 720 horsepower.  It's just a beautiful automobile for somebody that appreciates beautiful automobiles.  If I was going through a midlife crisis of that magnitude, I would get what they get,  what people get.  The vet.  You're pissing off the vet fans.  No.  What the fuck, dude?  They get the vet.  They like our show, too.  Look, see?  They like our show, too.  That's a fucking car right there. 
[01:54:30]  That's the fucking car.  Yeah.  That's my car.  That's the one I have.  Now, that doesn't say midlife crisis.  That says I wasn't able to have anything but a Chevy Nova when I was a kid.  Yeah, but the teenager in the passenger seat says...  That says midlife crisis.  All right.  I will agree with that.  You know, Rich, I think you got a good night's sleep for once.  We appreciate it.  We appreciate you coming in here well-rested for once.  Rich is tacking out, though.  He's going to blow his motor.  Oh, shit.  I'm good. 
[01:55:00]  I mean, you talk about how I'm sick all the time.  One more time, I have to hear how tired you are, and I couldn't sleep before the show.  I've been killing the last five times here.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Going over the tapes the last five times.  I've been on fucking fire.  And I...  God damn these fans, when they start coming out to see me, Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Enough of this bullshit.  Seven fucking years?  What the fuck?  Three guys?  And they're really two plus one?  Yeah.  Fat guys, right?  No, they're not all...  Show us your abs again.  Yeah, please.  Oh, shit.  Thank you, Rich. 
[01:55:30]  Thank you.  They're not all...  What a treat.  Show Nicole them.  Huh?  Next time Nicole walks by, show Nicole.  And I want her honest opinion.  You'll be able to know her opinion just by seeing her face.  Oh, that's her opinion.  All right, here we go.  Smelly up the...  They don't stink.  There's crackling.  Come on.  Alana's ready to fly off the handle.  Do you want to hear this or not?  Yes.  Susie, what do you think?  Midlife crisis sports cars.  Yes!  You don't think that makes them look cool? 
[01:56:00]  No!  They can't handle the power.  Have you ever been behind one of them when they drive those things?  It's scary.  I don't know.  Jake and I rode with Lee, and he did pretty well behind the wheel.  Well, I have a nice little sports car.  I'm 63 years old.  I just happen to like sports cars.  I know, but you're past your midlife crisis already.  Do you think I look like a dork in my Mustang convertible California special GT?  He's got a Mustang GT, oh no!  He has the same car?  I've been hung out to drive. 
[01:56:30]  He says the exact same thing.  I just like this car, and he's got a Mustang convertible GT.  I don't have a convertible.  See, it's different.  Convertible really says midlife crisis.  Well, but he has a GT.  Is that a Shelby?  Is that what you have?  No, it's a GT.  It's like when a girl would drive to high school, right?  Yeah, yeah.  It's not a fucking Shelby Super Snake.  Hey, guys.  Fuck, yeah, that's a regular car.  My sister has that, by the way.  My sister has that car.  It's a chick car, right?  Yeah, it's a secretary car. 
[01:57:00]  Hey, guys, we have callers, and we interact with our callers, too.  And they want to actually play along with another morning show's bit.  Oh, right?  Let's go with Travis in New Hampshire.  Travis.  Yeah, I'd like to take a stab at the question of the deck.  Sure, which is what?  Again, I forgot.  Things people do to look cool, but they look dorky.  Just a big dork.  Yes.  I'm going to go with hair plugs.  Oh, they're not plugs.  They're individual follicles surgically implanted from the harvest area artistically in the direction your hair naturally grows. 
[01:57:30]  Let's go to Jeremy in Georgia.  Jeremy.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, I've got the ultimate thing that will make you look like a dork as a midlife crisis statement.  A shooting spree.  Nothing says, I'm going to get these fuckers back like a shooting spree, but in essence, you just make yourself look like an asshole. 
[01:58:00]  Now you just ruin like a thousand billion people's lives.  See how he's keeping, he's going and going, hoping to get traction, but it's just, there's only one way to solve this phone call.  Rhett, show us your abs.  God damn, I got ones.  Does anyone else have ones?  That fixes everything.  I don't think you've ever got a positive call on shooting sprees.  No, never. 
[01:58:30]  No.  I mean, no.  All right, here we go.  Why don't we continue?  Because she's about to go off the handle.  Yeah, she's going to go crazy.  She's going to show a little edge right here.  No, but you're past your midlife crisis already.  Do you think I look like a dork in my Mustang convertible California special GT?  Um, you know what?  Let's save that for another day.  Whoa!  Wait a minute.  Look what you started, ma'am.  Sorry.  It's like somebody gives me truth serum in the morning and I can't hold back. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, I'm kind of the same way.  I love these shows that just keep it fun.  My, yeah, good.  You're raving.  But that should have ended with a punch in the face.  She was getting a little sassy with them, though.  Like, hey.  She knew to just hold back in time, man.  But that's why she's good on the radio.  Because she takes, you know, a douse of truth serum.  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know.  And she let it out there.  She's not holding back.  Our listeners want to play.  John, Jersey.  John. 
[01:59:30]  What about fly fishing?  Oh, man.  It's something people do that looks really dorky.  Well, I'm, yeah.  And they think it's cool.  Oh, man.  I had fun.  Yeah.  And you got sick.  Yeah, with the trout flu.  Oh, gosh.  Ready to move on?  When Bobby stepped in the water, did a tsunami hit?  It's gaining some weight, pal.  What's that about?  Much to everyone's pleasure.  What's that about? 
[02:00:00]  Everyone.  You know what?  It's so good.  He actually sat down as he ordered two breakfasts.  And one was a Hungry Man special.  And was dreaming about being in his 50s with a really good body and shape with his wife walking down the beach.  This is a story that I, unfortunately, don't have on tape.  And, you know, I want to be one of those older couples where I look good with my shirt off, dude.  You know, when I hit 40, I'm going to get in shape.  He's not 40 yet?  No shit.  That's what I thought, too.  Oh, wow.  That's bad.  Didn't he just spend the last two years getting in shape, though? 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, he looked great.  I didn't notice.  Well, you said he gained weight.  I haven't noticed.  Well, a little bit back.  You know, people tend to yo-yo a little bit.  Yeah, really?  You know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Oprah syndrome.  He's, well, yeah.  He's, he'll be fine.  Everybody loved it, though.  They're like, oh, you lost so much weight.  You look great.  Can't wait till he gets it back.  Oh, I can't wait.  Yeah.  Are we going to move on with this?  Yes, please.  I like to.  Lee and Alana, or Alina, or Lonnie, I don't know. 
[02:01:00]  Lee and the broad start the 10-second tirade.  What's this about, Sam?  This is one, I mean.  We might have to take this.  This is what I'm saying.  Look at the name.  We have the FU line.  They have their equivalent.  They have the 10-second tirade.  And I think, you know, I gave a whole bunch of examples.  I think this is one that our listeners could latch on to as well.  The 10-second tirade.  But we need to let Lee and Alana really explain.  Can we do the 10-second tirade on our show?  Yeah, we can steal this one. 
[02:01:30]  It's unorthodox, but can we do it?  By the way, we did come up with the FU line.  Almost every show now is doing it.  Some do their own little version of it, I guess.  The 10-second tirade.  Hey, Travis, clear the phones.  We're going to do the 10-second tirade in a little bit.  Clear the field.  But you've got to play along like they do.  What is it?  Well, let Lee and Alana explain the rules in this track.  Listen for the rules before you call our show.  Of course.  We do this every once in a while as a public service.  And we call it a public service because, you know, they say that the best way to get something 
[02:02:00]  clear of your head, you know, something's really been bugging you, is just to kind of get it out.  Let it go, right?  Don't hold on to it.  Don't let the pressure build up.  You know what's funny is yesterday I was reading one of my little daily...  As soon as you say, you know what's funny, you know nothing funny is about to be said.  Oh, funny story.  No.  No.  No, this is funny.  Oh, my...  Oh, you know what's funny?  Uh, not...  Pressure build up.  You know what's funny is yesterday I was reading one of my little daily devotionals, and it 
[02:02:30]  says, the funny thing with a pet pee...  Sam, what's a daily devotional?  Daily devotional.  It's like an inspirational quote.  You guys don't, like, before you come into work, there's not...  You don't have, like, some kind of calendar or something.  Like, tender sentiments?  Yeah.  Linger longer.  Sam, you got a homework assignment.  What's that?  If you want to get a good grade in your college class for your internship.  Okay, technically, I've been an employee for over three years.  You're not an intern?  No, no, no.  Oh, shit.  I'm sorry.  Literally on the books for over three years. 
[02:03:00]  Wow.  Really?  I still got to write up a nice thing for your professor, so...  No, I mean, I've been out of school for that amount of time as well.  Really?  Yes, I graduated from college, Syracuse University, three years ago.  Fuck, when you...  How's that working out for you?  Well, I have...  This is the job I have.  Oh!  This is where I'm employed.  When are you going to finally get a real job, though?  I thought you just showed up.  No.  Oh.  No, that was...  I did for a while, but then I got hired.  Really?  Doing what?  Actually, this.  I get some clips.  I'm an associate producer.  Of what?  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Oh, congratulations.  This show. 
[02:03:30]  That's important.  That's amazing.  Actually, associate producer is the lowest title you can...  Oh, is it?  Yes.  An associate.  I don't see it.  Yeah, that would be the lowest title you can...  Are you sensitive, it sounds like?  Yeah, much higher than me.  At least three levels.  And you're starting to get the impression that we should maybe pay more attention to  what's going around.  Nah.  Nah.  All right.  He just gives a shit.  Fucking show up and I'm out of here with cartoon fucking character smoke behind me.  Oh.  I want...  What was it called? 
[02:04:00]  Daily Devotions.  All right, Sam, this is your homework assignment for the extra credits for your college class.  I want a daily devotion calendar in this studio by tomorrow morning.  Daily Devotion.  Done.  Hold on, I might have one in my bag.  Sure.  And then he goes, no, like I thought he did.  Right.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  I might have one in my bag.  No, I really don't.  You might have someone to my shirt.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Fucking abs! 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, I'm staying.  Oh, fucking K!  Yes!  Rock solid abs!  Fucking...  Jesus.  You know, I just got a thought in.  This is how it's going to be like when we're in an old age home someday.  Yeah.  This is pretty much what they do.  This is it.  But we could say good morning to the river and good night every night to the river.  We're hanging with some beautiful friends right now.  Four ladies at the dinner table who became beautiful friends. 
[02:05:00]  Shut up.  Get in the coffin.  You fucking talk about what burdens you are.  All right, let's get into the...  The 10-second tie rate.  Oh, right, sir.  Ah, thank you.  Of course.  Yesterday, I was reading one of my little daily devotionals, and it says,  the funny thing with a pet peeve is that people tend to pet it a lot.  That's good.  I thought that was pretty good.  We got our 10-second tie rate clock ready?  You bet.  You ready?  Do you mind if I...  I mean, it is our show. 
[02:05:30]  Is it okay if I go ahead and do one?  Yes.  Yeah, 10 seconds.  But remember, the rule is, once it's done, put a smile on your face.  Yes.  All right, what?  What's going on with that guy?  It's like the FU line.  Right.  But it's limited to 10 seconds.  10-second tie rate.  It's done live.  You kind of get off whatever's on your mind, whatever you're frustrated with.  Wow.  But the rule, the main rule here is that once...  Remember, our listeners got to listen closely.  Yes.  Yeah.  Once you're done, once your 10-second tie rate is over, you need to end with a smile. 
[02:06:00]  How do you end with a smile?  Because it's off your mind.  Because it's off your mind, off your chest, and now you can finally smile.  And you know what?  It's because it's not a feel-bad thing.  No, no, no.  This is not negative, Opie.  It can't be negative.  No.  Because they probably went through this, too, with the PD.  They sat down and went like, we're going to do the 10-second tie rate.  It's like, what's that?  Well, we got this thing where people just vent and yell about things that they're not happy with.  And then the PD goes, you know, it just seems too angry. 
[02:06:30]  It's not a fun...  See, we do a fun show here.  What if, when they're done, they've had so much weight lifted off of them that now they're smiling and happy.  See, we've turned it around.  Put down the knife!  You fucking losers, the program directors.  No one's saying...  When she's saying, you know what the thing about pet peeve is you pet it once in a while?  And they all go, that's funny?  Yeah.  Like, that's funny? 
[02:07:00]  Could you imagine him and her in the front row at the virus shows?  Okay, if they thought that was funny, how great they would have thought, like, Louis C.K. was or Patrice?  Something tells me that's not quite their cup of tea.  Some of those guys are a little negative, I think.  A little negative and a little blue.  Yeah, a little blue, as they say.  Why can't they be funny without cursing?  You know, I don't understand that.  There's no need for the cursing.  It's the easy way out.  Yeah, really. 
[02:07:30]  It's what it is.  Yeah.  Lowest common denominator.  The fuck up.  Larry King's checking in, Ant.  Oh, Larry King.  He's always on topic.  Larry, what do you got?  I have my 10-second tirade.  Yeah.  I like the way little boys' toes smell after they walk through my shit.  Are you smiling?  Yeah, Larry's smiling.  Larry's always on topic.  Thank you, Larry, for always being on topic.  Go with that, people.  I just set you up for a nice bit that we can ride for the next couple of weeks. 
[02:08:00]  A couple of weeks?  Yes.  Just go with that one.  You know, Larry King, on topic always.  Okay, and that'll be the punchline to that bit.  Here we go.  The 10-second tirade.  Do one?  Yes.  Yeah, 10 seconds, but remember, the rule is, once it's done, put a smile on your face.  Yes.  Once it's done, the rule is, you have to put it in my hiney.  No.  There is a bit of a hiss to his S's.  There seems to be a bit of a hiss to his S's.  He's just happy to be there.  Yeah.  Probably goes around showing his abs to everybody on the show. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Talking about how hot Stanley T is.  Yeah.  Boy, I sure wish someone would show their abs.  Oh, Jesus, I'm that guy.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Wow!  Woo!  Do the bit!  Do the bit!  I mean, you can see how a white girl can fall for him.  Yeah.  If you want...  That could be my new Starbucks store.  I'll walk down the street and just... 
[02:09:00]  Just show your abs?  I would love to get reaction shots from the ladies as you just show your abs.  I got my flip.  Right after the show, we go to Times Square.  That would be really good.  We're doing Rich Voss showing strangers his abs.  And just get the reaction shot of the ladies, the young ladies.  It'll be up on my YouTube channel later.  I want to see 25 faces of girls going...  One after another.  Ugh!  Ugh!  Ugh!  Ugh!  Ugh!  Ugh!  Ugh!  Ugh!  Ugh!  Ugh!  Ugh!  Ugh!  Ugh!  Ugh!  Ugh!  Sam, you want in?  Oh!  Yeah!  We'll do a little filming after the show today?  Yes!  All right.  Hey, here we go.  10 second tirade. 
[02:09:30]  Remember, the rule is, once it's done, put a smile on your face.  Yes.  Ready?  Several weeks ago, my hot water heater went bad.  It leaked all over my garage.  And by the time I got it fixed, it cost me $1,100!  $1,100 for a water heater?  Are you kidding me?  What's going on?  Okay.  Smile now.  Smile.  I've been wanting to do that.  Seriously.  That's good.  I haven't had anybody to talk to, because my wife is in Arizona, and will be there for  a month, so I'm like, oh, I need somebody to vent to. 
[02:10:00]  That felt good.  Don't say anything bad.  She's not a public figure, and we could get in trouble for that.  Fuck!  I had a great line, you motherfucker!  I know you did.  Can I at least write my line down?  I saw you fucking...  Can I at least write my line down?  Dude, I saw you with the wind-up.  I saw you with the fucking wind-up.  And that, by the way, is one of the most common things that jocks do that get them in trouble,  is ragging on the not-public-eye wives of other jocks.  Are you allowed to at least write something down?  You could write it down.  I want to fucking... 
[02:10:30]  I want to see it.  But, yeah, you gotta watch that.  His tirade was he paid $1,100 for a water heater.  $1,100 for a water heater.  Probably...  That's not bad.  That's a good deal.  Installed?  Installed, really?  Yeah, come on.  Is it installed?  My tirade is he hasn't given me the number of the person that installed it for that price.  That's my tirade.  That's...  Oh.  I'm still writing, by the way.  That isn't bad.  Why is he fucking pissed?  Yeah.  The water heater goes.  If it was a brand-new water heater, I could see him be pissed, but it didn't sound like that.  You're concentrating on the wrong thing. 
[02:11:00]  What am I...  The whole thing is he's not pissed anymore.  Let's think of it that way.  It's a tirade.  Okay?  He's not pissed.  Okay, here's what...  What was the setup again?  His wife is in Arizona.  He had no one to vent to because his wife is in Arizona.  I was joking.  Pick off your rainbow shoes.  I was joking.  Fucking D-boy rules.  All right, what was the setup again?  That he had no one to vent to because his wife is in Arizona.  And he was venting about the water heater and all that.  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  I don't know if he's doing that. 
[02:11:30]  Well, that would be...  I just did a translation joke.  That would be something that one of the Ten Commandments say you shouldn't do.  Ah, of course.  Mars!  Hi, Mars!  Hey, Mars!  Yeah, Mars!  Da-da-da-da-da.  It's Mars.  That's your competition today, Rich.  It's Mars.  Right after the Jocktober bin.  You can't make an opinion about somebody that's not... 
[02:12:00]  No, because it's usually not an opinion.  A lot of jocks have gotten in trouble in the past.  We have never, by the way.  When they get in battles with other DJs, and then they go for the wife or kids of the DJ  who aren't public figures.  The Jock is a public figure.  Yeah.  So you could say, oh, that guy looks like he'd love to suck on a big fucking cock.  You could say that.  But you can't start picking on the wife or children, then you get into that area.  But what if the other Jock uses their wife or spouse or whatever... 
[02:12:30]  On the air?  ...talks about them all the time, then they are a public figure.  Then there's an argument that it could be a public figure, and those cases sometimes  have been won by other jocks.  They've said, yes, she is a public figure.  An occasional call on the air doesn't merit that.  If they become like a character on the show, then there's a problem.  I don't know what the relationship is there.  I don't know if she's on this program, so I'd rather err on the side of safety and keep 
[02:13:00]  my job.  We study this shit.  Trust me, we study this shit.  Yes.  People think we're just stupid, but we actually have studied FCC law.  Okay.  Yeah, Rich, enough.  In other words, shut the fuck up.  I'm trying to learn.  I don't want to make your mistake.  You can't go off like you do about your own wife.  And I'm going to have a tweet later on today that's going to make no sense to anybody.  Just want to say that. 
[02:13:30]  Very good.  Perfect.  OP Radio on Twitter.  Just a tweet out of nowhere that tweet.  What the fuck is this?  Has he lost his fucking mind?  I don't know what this means.  You can tweet whatever the fuck you want.  How's that computer working for you, Dan?  I see Danny.  Danny is ready to stick his head through a monitor.  All I keep seeing is that error thing and the Windows thing that never really shuts the  program down.  I honestly thought about just taking the tower out and how much it would cost to just replace 
[02:14:00]  the tower because I really just wanted to take it and just smash the shit like office  space when they take the fax machine into the field.  I thought about seriously doing that about 25 seconds ago.  I put two 23 rounds right through one of my computers.  I was so angry.  At a range, at a safety of a range.  I brought it down to the range and I unloaded on it because I was very angry at the computer.  This program is not responding.  So why don't you hit end now, Danny?  Why don't you do a 10 second tirade about it? 
[02:14:30]  Hang on.  Oh, you want a 10 second tirade with a smile?  Danny, and then you got to smile afterwards.  All right, stand up for your 10 second tirade.  The computer's got to mad.  Danny's doing the 10 second tirade.  You know what?  I'm going to even make sure I get the most out of my 10 seconds by timing it.  I'll time it.  I got a big clock in front of me.  He's got a clock and I got the bell.  All right.  Hold on.  I'll tell you when to go.  We're going on to three.  We're going on to three.  And go!  This fucking computer never works.  It crashes every day.  Like five times a day, I got to reboot this fucking thing.  It never works when I need it to.  I have to restart it all the time. 
[02:15:00]  I want a new computer.  Wow.  Now smile.  Oh, he smiled.  It's okay, guys.  It's okay.  Does that feel good, Danny?  In his vulgarity.  He's tirade.  He smiled.  You feel that felt good?  A lot of cursing.  It was 10 seconds.  I think they're onto something.  Yeah, it feels better now, right?  Oh, look.  And the computer started working.  Hey.  The computer works.  All positivity.  Yeah, that's what this show's about.  I was joking about the mouth thing, but D-Boy came up with the mouth sweeper.  Fucking D-Boy.  D-Boy rules.  Fucking D-Boy.  But what is wrong with this guy's mouth? 
[02:15:30]  It's not.  What is wrong with it?  What the fuck is that?  D-Boy.  Was D-Boy out drinking last night?  I hope so.  I hope so.  D-Boy rules.  It was Wednesday.  Of course he was.  Was it only Wednesday last night?  I think so.  Shit, I thought it was Thursday.  Fuck.  No, today's Thursday.  And another day of this bullshit?  It's going to be a good show.  But that's tomorrow's Friday.  That's true.  See? 
[02:16:00]  Plus, we got Lita Ford today.  And I hear Monday's a holiday, right?  It is?  What's Monday?  Monday's, like, what, Columbus Day or something?  One of those days we never get off.  I think we already...  But everyone else does.  It's got to be a Jew holiday.  Pour them.  Oh, God.  Now, I'll be a Jew holiday.  Jack's telling me that Monday is Canadian Thanksgiving.  Oh, is it?  By the way, every night's pour them for me.  Ha ha, get it?  Pour them, just keep them.  Yuck.  Yeah, I'd rather hear that.  This stupid bird has asthma. 
[02:16:30]  10-second tirades.  Stupid birds.  All right, you want to go back to this...  What are they...  What are we in the middle of?  The 10-second tirade.  Oh, right.  Because the audience, their audience loves the 10-second tirades.  It gives them a chance to get what's on their mind off their chest.  They get involved.  They get to be a little radio star for 10 seconds.  Sounds great.  Does that bring in some positive vibes, get the negativity off?  Yes.  Yes.  Cameron, all right, the rule is once 10 seconds is up, you've got to put a smile on your face, 
[02:17:00]  all right?  Okay, no problem.  Ready, set, go.  I hate how I haven't been called out for work yet.  I fight forest fires, and I've yet to be called out.  But isn't that kind of good?  No.  I mean, no work is bad, but no forest fires are good.  Yes.  But I get the frustration.  Yes.  How about this, Cameron?  I have a ton of weeds in my backyard.  If I lit those on fire, would you be willing to come extinguish them?  Yes.  All right. 
[02:17:30]  Smile on your face, Cameron.  What?  Why?  Smile on your face, Cameron.  They didn't call him out that this song.  He can't wait to get his catchphrase out there.  They didn't call her out that his fucking tirade stumped.  Yeah, what's wrong with being honest if you do a radio show?  Just a little bit.  He couldn't hit 10 seconds.  Yeah.  And it was just a stupid one.  Well, Anthony, this is why your criticism of it is not good, because...  I'm sorry.  Maybe I should smile, because that was a tirade for me.  What's positive about what you just did?  You're right.  You know?  You're right.  I should be more positive. 
[02:18:00]  Are you guys thinking what I'm thinking?  Tirades.  Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  10-second tirade?  We rip it off?  Nope.  We've got to turn this thing around, because that was a bad little fucking audio clip right  there.  Yeah, it was.  Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  What?  Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  Apparently not.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Then do it!  Yeah!  Rich's abs!  Boss's abs.  Wow.  Thank you, Rich.  Thank you.  Damn.  Here's how you've got to really do it.  Oh, God.  Stop.  He says, here's how you've really got to do it. 
[02:18:30]  Then he backs up all the way to the door, so we get a better look.  I'm at the point of shaving my chest again.  That's how good they look.  And my stomach.  Oh, my God.  Guys.  That is horrific.  Matter of fact, if you guys can get me one of those...  What?  You want us to oil you up?  Power...  What, a power razor?  A razor and a...  Yeah.  I think Voss masturbates in the mirror.  Yeah.  Oh, you must. 
[02:19:00]  If you do that, it's a sign of split personality.  I think I talked about that before.  I think he comes on his stomach with Rogaine.  You've got hairy abs.  All right.  Here we go.  We've got to hurry up because the big Lita Ford interview is almost a pause.  Oh, fuck.  I forgot about that.  The second I saw it having fun, I remember that.  We still got to do the Mars thing, too.  Are you guys ready with that?  I think so.  All right.  Good.  What are you doing with Mars? 
[02:19:30]  You and Mars going at it.  At what?  How are we doing it?  See who can pronounce the...  Celebrities.  Celebrity names.  Names, yeah.  I know how good both of you are at that.  Yeah.  You can do good.  I'm not worried about this one.  Brad gives his 10-second tirade.  Or to Rod.  Brad, have you got a 10-second tirade?  Yeah.  Now remember the rule.  After you're done with your 10 seconds, you must put a smile on your face.  All right.  Okay.  On your mark, get set, go.  I'm so sick and tired of people taking vacation when we're shorthanded and the inventory 
[02:20:00]  is coming up and your boss is mad.  Excellent.  What kind of inventory?  Oh, too bad.  The counting time.  I want to ask the question at the buzzer.  She's like, oh, too bad.  Really?  Great.  What kind of inventory?  The person gets 10 seconds.  He used about half of it.  You're asking a question that takes five seconds.  He can't answer.  He can't answer.  10 seconds is out.  And then she goes, oh, too bad.  And she wanted to know what kind of inventory he's doing.  Yeah.  To bring everybody in.  That is exciting stuff. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  Inventory.  Oh, too bad.  I want to ask the question at the buzzer.  You're not allowed to answer.  Do you feel better, Brad?  Do you feel like you got it off your chest?  I do feel better.  I just wish the guy that was on vacation was in Oregon so he could hear this.  Oh, well, that might not be so pleasant than when he comes back.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  You just fucking die.  We're part of the same business.  I get so fucking pissed when I go home.  Who the fuck's listening to that?  Now, smile. 
[02:21:00]  Smile?  Anytime.  He just smiled.  Anytime a radio host, any of them, don't use the voice they use off the air, on the air,  it's going to be horrible right from the beginning.  You don't use your real voice.  Yeah.  We try.  No, no.  You know what I'm saying.  He's doing that fucking radio.  Yeah, he's got the big radio voice where they have to talk like something's wrong with  their mouth.  I don't know what it is.  It just sounds to me.  What did you say?  Well, it sounds to me like as he talks, there seems to be something wrong with this gentleman's 
[02:21:30]  mouth.  I don't understand it.  What is wrong with this guy's mouth?  What is wrong with it?  It's like the comics from the 80s that talked with a high Seinfeld voice.  So, you ever know?  That's how they did in the 80s.  The Seinfeld thing.  The high-pitched fucking punchline voice.  Are you watching Curb Your Enthusiasm?  And why do they put that in the way?  All right.  The staccato delivery. 
[02:22:00]  Are you watching Curb Your Enthusiasm with the Seinfeld thing?  Holy shit, is that well-written.  Well-written.  The cast has made their appearance.  It's a reunion without a reunion.  It's perfect.  This past Sunday, the whole cast of Seinfeld made their appearance on Curb Your Enthusiasm.  I gotta get it on DVD.  Fucking great.  That Larry David.  Jesus.  I know.  All right, here we go.  A lot of people confirm that.  Danette gives her tirade.  She has two.  But she's got to fit him in ten seconds. 
[02:22:30]  Are they going to tell her that?  Oh, boy.  Who's this?  This is Danette.  Danette, did you have something you need to get off your chest?  I have two quick things I want to get off my chest.  Oh, two.  Okay.  Well, five seconds to eat the Sloan-  Oh, no.  At the Sloan-Kettering Hospital?  It is breast cancer awareness monster.  Oh, boy.  Maybe she's confusing the two.  Oh, boy.  Sorry.  Felt bad.  Well, I think she wants to get off her chest.  Yeah, Melitos so these sick fucks can make a promo about it. 
[02:23:00]  Who's this?  This is Danette.  Danette, did you have something you need to get off your chest?  I have two quick things I want to get off my chest.  Oh, two.  Okay.  Well, five seconds each.  You hear her?  Oh, two.  Oh, boy.  I don't know what we do.  What do we do?  Oh, two?  Because you don't want to say no.  You don't want to say you can't.  That's negative.  But she's so confused.  Oh, two?  I want to get off my chest.  Oh, two.  Okay.  Well, five seconds each.  Yes.  Five seconds each.  Here you go. 
[02:23:30]  You ready?  On your mark.  Get set.  Go.  Okay.  I don't smoke.  Don't hang your cigarette out the window because I can still smell it.  And P.S.  Don't flick it out the window when you're done with it.  And secondly, don't pull out in front of me and then flip me off because you're mad that  I'm on your tail.  Oh, nice.  Oh, nice.  Good one.  You're done.  Both excellent ones.  Smile.  Let me see those pearly whites.  Beautiful.  Good girl.  What's wrong?  I'd rather get a prostate exam than what? 
[02:24:00]  Than listen to this.  And I hate prostate exams.  This is a great show for Jocktober.  You love him.  You fucking sick fuck.  Great show for Jocktober.  I love him.  This is my favorite Jocktober 09 show so far.  Yeah, it's not bad.  This is a good one.  And then the final clip today.  Mike gives his final 10 second tirade.  Wait for the smile, kids.  Who's this?  Hi.  My name's Mike.  Mike.  Go ahead with your 10 second tirade.  I absolutely cannot stand when everybody's piled up in the right lane and you have to turn 
[02:24:30]  right.  Yes.  There's always that one person left in the right lane that stops you from turning right.  That's when you walk up to their window and you go, excuse me, what are you doing?  Try that in the Bronx.  Excuse me, what are you doing?  Driving dummy.  Excuse me.  This is not a show, if you were in Portland, Oregon, this is not a show you would listen 
[02:25:00]  to?  No.  Oh.  No.  Not.  I'd rather collect kiddie porn.  Oh, wow.  Is this punishing?  The punishment's a huge point.  I'd rather be arrested.  I'd rather take the chance of collecting kiddie porn than listen to this shit, Sam.  Wow.  I'd rather be in the general population of a prison after a child abduction and murder.  After they grab my hard drive, yes. 
[02:25:30]  Wow.  Yes.  All right.  Gee.  Smile, everybody.  Smile.  Why wear it?  Because that makes it all positive now.  Why wear the tattoo of a swastika with a circle and a line through it?  Exactly.  You got that one?  All right, good.  Swastika.  Swastika.  Swastika.  I said swastika.  Swastika.  All right.  Can you imagine that this is all you have in bumper-to-bumper traffic?  Portland.  I feel bad.  Thank God for Sirius XM satellite radio taking over the nation. 
[02:26:00]  Yes.  You don't have to listen.  Pushing all these bad shows out.  Crap.  You don't think these guys are going to deal?  Fuck no, Sam.  Oh.  I mean, if they're making a living, God bless them, but.  Jesus.  That's right.  Smile.  Smile.  Hey, I want a little discussion about Curb Your Enthusiasm, Anthony, because I said that  Larry David, I said it's well-written what they're doing with the Seinfeld reunion, and  a couple of people called me out on that because it's an improv thing, but I do not believe  that.  It's not completely improv. 
[02:26:30]  I believe that the show's well-written, giving the actors a chance to do a little of that  improv.  Travis knows everything about Seinfeld.  I would say the majority of it probably is improv.  They're giving bullet points as to what has to happen in the scene.  Someone has to write the bullet points.  Someone has to have a direction for the show.  That's what I'm getting at.  So the story itself is written.  We've done them.  Yeah, the story is written.  And you don't think, and I, no.  I'm sorry.  Listen to me.  So now you're an actor.  You're in this Larry David, Curb Your Enthusiasm thing. 
[02:27:00]  Me and Anne are improv-ing, right?  Yeah.  And then Larry goes, whoa, I liked what you did there.  Let's go with that a little bit.  They're kind of writing it as they go.  Do you think that whole thing where Larry David and Jason Alexander are sitting in the  restaurant, and the waiter comes by, and the tip segment.  Dude, that's so real.  That's scripted.  That's scripted.  But getting to that point is improv.  I completely disagree.  I think some of the lines in there are improv. 
[02:27:30]  Sure.  When they're going back and forth, calling them, you know, why do you want to know about  how much I'm tipping on that?  Yeah, the whole concept was written.  But the concept itself, all those segment concepts are written.  And then within that, they can then use their own shit.  If it was all improv, it would have to be done on one take.  If they do it in a couple takes, then it's not improv anymore.  I don't think it's as improv as people think it is.  I really don't.  That coming from the great actor, Richard Voss. 
[02:28:00]  Well, no.  I've done a lot of reality.  I've done a lot of unscripted pilots.  And you don't think when those guys are improv and they're like, we like that, but.  And then they sit down and they work it a little bit and go, okay, wait.  But say it this way or do this or try this.  Yes.  I completely think so.  Yeah.  So shut up.  If not, then I'm wrong.  Rich, where are you going to be?  We're going to take a break and then we're going to have a little competition.  You want to meet your competition for real, Mars?  He's terrific.  Friday night at Rhythms in Vandal.  Can you play along for the radio audience?  Oh, yeah.  Where is my competition? 
[02:28:30]  How do I know when the fuck you're real or play along or, you know?  You're real or play along.  You're real or make the lead.  I don't know.  How the fuck?  You're cutting your throat one time telling me to shut up.  We do try to kind of like develop a radio show in front of everybody's eyes.  This is my competition right here.  Mars.  Pleased to meet you.  Pleased to meet you.  It's a pleasure.  Why do you have that ban?  Are you protesting the Vietnam War still?  No, I actually got injured in a BJJ.  In a what?  Grappling.  You suck it? 
[02:29:00]  Oh, I threw you.  A BJ accident, buddy.  A BJJ.  Shouldn't that be the back of your head?  Should be around his throat.  Mars, you ready to take on Voss?  Yes, sir.  By the way, Justin, New York City makes a very good point.  They're writing it as they go.  You mean improv-ing.  All right, enough.  Whatever.  What do you got, Mars?  Are you ready to take him on for real?  I'm ready.  Let's do it.  We're not doing it right now.  We're taking a break.  Okay.  All right.  I almost bought a Bruce Lee t-shirt where he's in midair with some kind of fucking karate 
[02:29:30]  kick, and I was going to wear that shirt.  But then I thought people would think I know how to fight, and then I'd be in deep trouble.  You could wear a shirt.  I see what you're doing.  It's kind of like the shirt you got on, the UFC.  It's like a shadowy fucking two-figures fighting t-shirt.  Yeah.  And I saw one like that with Bruce Lee.  But I'm thinking, then people are going to think I could actually fight.  Yeah, but that's like a concert t-shirt.  They don't think you're going to get up there and start singing.  That's like, yeah.  I have a t-shirt where I'm drilling a hole.  A guy's drilling a hole through a stall. 
[02:30:00]  I don't want them to think that that's what I do.  How many money-lending t-shirts do you have?  Is it hot in here?  It's so bad.  It's hot, right?  Shelling out some money and filling out some forms.  Mars.  That's terrible.  You want to do your Rich Voss impression?  I have a Rich Voss impression?  Yeah, I heard you have a really good Rich Voss impression.  You want to hear, Rich?  Oh, I can't wait.  Yeah, please.  You did the Norton one yesterday, and then you did the Voss one in the office.  I don't have a Rich Voss impression. 
[02:30:30]  Mars.  All right, I know.  Well, don't you have one?  No, he's just downplaying it.  It's actually really good.  Show us your abs.  That's a good enough impression.  Mars?  No.  Show us your abs.  No.  What was that?  What'd you do, fart?  No.  Oh, no.  I've got to get in the way of the air conditioner now, so it blows the fart smells away.  Is the morning mashup walking by?  I don't know.  No, that's our intern.  They do a lot of walking.  Yeah, they sure do.  All right, Mars.  I guess this isn't going anywhere. 
[02:31:00]  No, it's not.  No, it was like a meet and greet.  I met him.  What am I supposed to do?  Put sparklers in my ass?  What the fuck?  I'm trying to plug my weekend.  I've got to make wee-wees.  All right, yeah, let's do this.  Oh, this Friday, October 10th, Rhythms in Manville, New Jersey, open to the public fundraiser.  Very good.  And then Saturday, Bananas in Hasbrook Heights, Friday with Bonnie, Saturday alone.  Mansville?  Manville.  Manville.  You're going to be showing your abs?  They're all going to be showing their abs in Manville. 
[02:31:30]  I'd rather be working in Man-Phil, but...  So, yeah.  Start the car, Alice.  Start the car.  They're shooting at us.  Even Rich knew that one.  You should have seen his face.  He was like, oh.  He was like, that came out of me?  I'm going to, I'm going to.  He didn't know what it was, the joke or the fart.  Guys, we're wasting time.  The big lead of Ford interviews, less than a half hour away. 
[02:32:00]  Let me fucking drain my bladder.  Is she in studio?  Yeah.  Do you want another one sheet?  Why?  I got one.  You didn't crumple it and...  Oh, I can get it out of the garbage if there's not too much coffee.  I'll give him mine there.  There he goes.  Do you need one or...  Nah, I memorized it.  Oh, good for you.  Lead of Ford was...  Runny nose.  Yeah, I got a runny nose. 
[02:32:30]  I didn't have a tissue, Sam.  Sorry.  That was very handy.  Full box of tissues, yet you blew your nose with your...  You need a Ford bio.  Do you need another copy?  Can I interview him and pretend I'm Opie?  Sure.  Please.  Please do.  Do the whole find it, Anthony, and I'm fucking on the expressway.  You give a shit.  All right, I'm going wee-wee.  All right, let's do that.  So, and you got the bananas plugging there, Rich?  Yes, Saturday.  Saturday night, Hasbro Kites, Rich Voss.  Okay.  Mars and Rich Voss go at it.  A little mispronunciation contest next. 
[02:33:00]  How come I can't take off Monday?  It's Columbus Day.  And you're...  I'm Italian.  If it's Martin Luther King Day, you know, black people get to take off.  It's not one of those holidays where everything is off.  It's one of those kind of marginal holidays, MLK Day.  Why can't I just take Columbus Day off?  He's a national hero in Italy.  You know?  And then the Jews get their Jewish holidays. 
[02:33:30]  They're in their...  Aren't they in their tents?  Are they in their tents?  They're in their tents, right?  They're sukked or something.  Sukk'en?  Sukk'en.  Like...  Sukk'en!  That's the Indian version.  A sukkah.  Sukk'en.  Sukk'en.  Is it Sukk'en?  Because I see there's a place near me.  Oh, yeah.  They set up all those little trellises.  Yeah, there's a tent in my neighborhood.  Yeah.  Is there?  Yeah.  And the kids are running around inside and stuff.  Rent control. 
[02:34:00]  Let's do rent control jokes.  Oh.  All right.  We're only minutes away from the big lead of four, Jim Gillette interview on the Opie and Anthony show.  It's an exclusive for us.  I hear they've arrived.  They have, yes.  We're going to have them in here in a few minutes.  And if we do take any questions from the audience, please.  Yeah, of course.  Serious questions all night.  Mars, you ready to play a little game with Rich Voss?  Let's do it.  Let's do it, right?  We're going to play...  Well, we're just going to show you guys celebrities. 
[02:34:30]  On what?  And you guys got to just say the celebrity's name.  It's as simple as that.  Now, just to show you where you're at, a little look at your competition, Rich.  Mars, once again, we had that big star from the X-Files in Californication on Friday.  David Duchovny.  There you go.  It's Duchovny.  What?  David Duchovny.  Mars, what is it?  David Duchovny.  And Rich?  David Duchovny.  David Duchovny. 
[02:35:00]  All right.  So, how do we do this, Dan?  You picked out some celebrities?  Yeah, I have a list of some celebs.  All right, show us the celebrities so we can maybe explain in such a way that the listener  at home understands who we're looking at, okay?  So, guys, don't say anything until we ask.  Who goes first?  Can I sit at the big boy table?  I'm really happy that you asked ahead of time there, Mars.  Yes, you can.  Thank you.  Can I tilt that computer a little bit?  He can't see.  Okay.  There you go.  Batman. 
[02:35:30]  No, Rich.  That's a screensaver.  That's the fucking background.  He got so excited.  Oh, this is going to be easy.  All right, show us the first celebrity.  Me and Ant will try to describe it for the audience at home.  The first, it's actually celebrities.  It's a twofer.  Ooh.  They've been in the news a lot recently.  Oh.  Katie and John.  What the fuck did we just say?  Who said that?  The both of them.  I didn't say the name yet.  No, Mars did.  I got it.  Mars just blurted it out.  And he said Kate and John when everyone knows it's John and Kate.  Yeah, Gosling. 
[02:36:00]  Gosling.  Right.  All right, there's an example of how we're not playing the game.  Right.  So there's a prime example of how this is not played.  There was one direction and it couldn't be taken.  Yeah.  Not by me.  Not by me.  One fucking rule.  And it also shows that this is going to be very good because Mars actually said Kate and John.  Yeah, I know.  The legal citizen didn't jump in.  Nothing.  Wow.  Stop chewing the gum, please.  Huh?  Stop chewing the gum.  It's not.  It's called a cud. 
[02:36:30]  Thank you.  Are we ready?  That poor gum.  Let me keep score here.  All right.  Your first celebrity.  Who's going to start?  Well, but wait a second.  How do we?  We don't just yell him out.  We got to eat, you know, it's not, there's no buzzer.  There's no, I mean, isn't, you know.  This is like when they do the Jeopardy parody on SNL.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The rules couldn't be simpler.  But who goes first?  You take turns?  I said we're going to take turns. 
[02:37:00]  Okay.  Well, who goes first on the first one?  We're trying to figure that out.  That's not hard.  You flip a coin.  It's odd or even.  It's either him or me.  How about you guys play rock, paper, scissor to find out who goes first?  Let's go.  I'm fucking an adult.  I don't do that kind of shit.  Yeah, you do.  Best out of three.  Two scissors.  Okay.  Two rocks.  Of course they think the same.  Paper cover rocks.  Paper covers rocks.  Okay.  That's one.  Best out of three.  With Voss's hand, it's like pebble postage stamp and tweezers.  You guys don't even know.  You go like this. 
[02:37:30]  Come on.  You do a fish shake.  If I do that, I might come.  You want to see Mars' abs?  No.  Just asking.  All right.  Best out of three.  Mars' down one.  Here we go.  One.  I won.  Rock crushes scissor.  Rich Voss goes first.  Oh, okay.  Danny, you ready?  Okay.  So Voss is going first.  Voss, who are these people?  Are we going to go back to them?  Yeah.  I thought that was the first one.  That's easy. 
[02:38:00]  He said it already.  John and Kate.  What?  It's the last name that.  Oh.  Gosselin.  Should have just moved on.  Yeah, let's move on.  Yeah, move on.  But that doesn't count.  Was that the last name?  That doesn't count.  That's close.  Gosselin.  Gosselin.  I don't know.  He would have, you know.  Probably Gosselin.  He probably would have fucked it up.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  The next celebrity.  Rich, you start the competition here.  Don't look at the name.  Yeah.  I can't see the name.  All right.  Ant, describe this. 
[02:38:30]  Of course, he was in Fargo.  He was in Fargo.  He was in Armageddon.  He was in Con Air.  Con Air.  He was a cameo in, I think, just about every Adam Sandler movie.  Yes.  He was in Sopranos.  He was in Sopranos.  In the Sopranos.  Very good, Mars.  Good knowledge right there.  But Reservoir Dogs.  Reservoir Dogs.  Very big.  And he played Buddy Holly, the waiter, in Pulp Fiction.  All right.  There you have it.  And I got this off the tip of my tongue.  Steve Buscemi.  Because he was also in I Think I Love My Wife with Chris Rock. 
[02:39:00]  And I worked with him on the set.  Steve Buscemi.  You worked on that movie?  Yeah.  I was one of the punch-ups.  I want to make sure.  You got Chris Rock coffee?  Huh?  You got Chris Rock's coffee.  No, I was one of the punch-ups.  I want it de-crack-inated.  Okay.  Voss, that's your final?  Yeah, Steve Buscemi. 
[02:39:30]  Mars?  Steve Buscemi.  Okay.  Well, but you know what?  They're not going to be-  No, no.  They need separate celebrities.  Yeah, separate.  So Rich Voss got his celebrity.  Okay.  So he got his celebrity.  All right.  Yeah.  One for one.  Now, of course, you know, since he said it-  All right.  So now it'll be Mars' turn then.  Now it's Mars' turn.  Yeah, here we go.  We go to Mars.  All right.  Mars, let us describe the celebrity before you say who it is.  Don't get the screen.  We want the listeners to play along at home.  All right.  We're going with this guy.  Oh, yes.  You might know this young man from Transformers. 
[02:40:00]  Okay.  He was in Transformers.  All right.  And then he was in that other movie, Transformers 2.  Indiana Jones, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.  Oh, he was in that last Indiana Jones that no one really liked.  Um, and he was in the Transformers movie.  You ready?  Yes.  Shia-  Lebef?  Lebef? 
[02:40:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  What's the full name?  You got to put the first name and last name together there.  It's, um, I think it's Shia.  I don't know his first name.  Well, just say the name.  Shia-  Lebef?  Lebef?  Oh, man.  Oh, God.  Now, when we have a fucking abortion name like that, can Rich get a chance to steal? 
[02:41:00]  Ooh, I like that.  Well, it doesn't matter because I have no clue who this is.  But that's a good idea.  All right.  You want to steal?  Why don't you try steal?  Because that was just not the right name.  Rich has one, Morris has zero.  But I don't lose anything.  No, no.  Oh, you know what?  We should have where you could lose it, but-  Well, then if you steal, then you got to get more, then you got to get one and a half  if you steal and one if you lose.  Oh, let's not make it complicated.  You don't lose a point.  All right, just for fun, what's his name?  No stealing. 
[02:41:30]  Fantasy?  I have no idea.  I couldn't tell you.  Write his name out so Rich could say it, just so everyone at home knows.  Okay.  And Morris, how'd you say his name?  I didn't see those movies.  Morris, once again?  Shia Leboeuf?  Shia Leboeuf.  Shia Leboeuf?  Shia Leboeuf.  And Rich, please let everyone know at home.  Shia Leboeuf.  All right, well, see how confident he was? 
[02:42:00]  That's the best part.  Oh, my gosh.  Looks around the room like, I got this one.  All right, Shia Leboeuf, very good.  And now we're back to-  Mars.  It's one.  Rich has one.  Mars has a zero.  Now, who is this for?  This is for a boss.  Right.  Oh, very popular.  Who is this guy?  Very popular actor.  Played Johnny Cash. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, I got it.  He was in Gladiator.  Gladiator?  Mars saying it's easy.  Hold on a minute.  And was also in-  Oh, that dumb Shama Lama Ding Dong movie.  Yes.  Which one was he in?  The Village, I think.  And Signs as well.  He was in Gladiators.  Signs and Gladiator, yeah.  You said that?  Well, Rich said Gladiators.  Gladiators.  It was just called Gladiator.  All right, Mars?  You said it's easy.  If you saw more than once, it was Gladiators.  Rich makes a point there.  That is true.  Mars, it's to you.  No, it's to me. 
[02:43:00]  It's to Voss.  Oh, it is to Voss.  Joaquin Phoenix.  That's what I'm saying.  Could you say it again?  No, I can't because I already won.  No, just for clarification.  Joaquin Phoenix.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm having a problem there.  I'm not sure.  No, it's, no.  Wait, wait, wait.  What is not except Joaquin?  Wait, wait.  What's his name?  Take me to the Waldorf Astoria.  One more time.  Well, you know what?  That never happens.  No, no, because I'm not sure if you're saying it right or not.  Yeah, we're trying to give you a point.  Go ahead.  Joaquin Phoenix.  No, he's not. 
[02:43:30]  Joaquin Phoenix.  It's wrong.  It's not black.  Huh?  It's wrong.  Joaquin Phoenix.  It's wrong.  It's wrong.  It's not wrong.  It's wrong.  Joaquin Phoenix.  Take me to the Waldorf Astoria.  Astoria.  This is great.  First time.  You almost had it.  Mars, you want to try?  You can steal.  Joaquin Phoenix.  Joaquin.  It's nice. 
[02:44:00]  You too.  Get the fuck out of here.  Wait, Rich, you said what?  Joaquin Phoenix.  Joaquin Phoenix.  And Mars, what did you say?  Joaquin Phoenix.  Joaquin Phoenix.  Joaquin Phoenix.  Holy shit.  You're both fucking.  Well, how the fuck did I get it wrong?  What is it then?  It's Joaquin.  Joaquin.  That's what I said.  You said Joaquin.  You said five times Joaquin.  Joaquin.  Joaquin.  First of all, here's the difference, okay?  Joaquin.  It's a soft end, too.  It's barely. 
[02:44:30]  It's Joaquin.  Oh.  Over one letter.  Letter.  Well, that's it.  Well, that's called either getting it right or wrong.  Right.  Wait, what the fuck?  We're not creating on a curve here.  They don't say, well, he only got it wrong by one letter on a spelling bee or something.  Oh.  All right.  Go ahead.  It's still one for Rich Voss, zero for Mars.  Zero for Mars.  Whose turn is it?  It is now Mars' turn.  All right.  Good.  Next celebrity, please.  Mars.  All right.  We go to a female prominently featured in the X-Men movies. 
[02:45:00]  She was also married to, I won't say the name, but I guess.  He was on Full House.  He was on Full House.  I don't want to blow it by giving the name.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  All right.  All right.  Relax, Rich.  Relax.  That's about all she's done.  She's the blue chick in fucking X-Men.  Right.  Very good.  Rebecca Ramjin. 
[02:45:30]  What?  You are fucking phonetic Mars, man.  I'm going to call you phonetic Mars.  That's his new name, phonetic Mars.  All right, one more time, just to make sure.  Rebecca Ramjin.  All right, very good.  All right, Rebecca Ramjin.  No point for you.  Zero, Rich for the steal.  Rebecca Stamos.  How did I cheat? 
[02:46:00]  She's not married to him anymore.  No, she's divorced, and that was her, we're looking for her original maiden name.  Well, you didn't say that.  Oh, just shut up and play along.  What's her original name?  Rebecca, what?  Well, Mars, tell him.  Ramjin?  See, it was Rebecca Ramjin Stamos.  Right, but it's not Ram-  Stamos anymore.  But there's no more Stamos, so what's her name?  Yeah.  Rebecca Ramjin.  No! 
[02:46:30]  What?  You got it wrong, that's why you're stealing.  You stole the same thing he did.  And we got to tear down every wall possible today.  Yeah.  This is no fucking joke.  No, no, no.  This is the real deal with these two.  Please, please don't even think this is a fucking-  Please believe this.  I beg you.  They're coached or they're fucking goofing.  This is too classic.  I don't want anyone thinking that this is like a set-off.  Well, here's where you said we can't say his name, so then you were saying technically-  Well, because I was thinking because-  My thinking was if you heard Stamos, that you would go, oh, and then remember the rest 
[02:47:00]  of her name.  Oh.  Yeah, I was with Anne on that.  So I didn't want to say it.  Oh, Anne.  It's still one zip.  It is.  It is.  Which one did you get right?  I forgot.  By the way, it's Rebecca Romaine.  Steve.  Romaine.  As in lettuce.  Oh, Romaine, yeah.  It's spelled Rom-jin.  Now, Mars, say it now that you know it.  Rebecca Romaine.  Yeah.  See?  Oh, Romaine.  We're going to ask you in five minutes.  Don't watch.  It'll be a different answer.

You might know him.  He is-  The number one Twitterer.  He is the number one Twitterer.  He is fucking Demi Moore.  I'm married to Demi.  He was in that 70s show.

Wait, did I get it wrong?  Yes.  Of course you did.  Mars?  Ashton Kushner.  Isn't that what he just said?  At least I said it with confidence.  Say it again, but articulate a little better so we can hear.  Ashton Kushner.  Ashton Kushner.  All right.  Wow.  Un-fucking-believable.  What?  Completely wrong.  Chris wants, from Ontario, wants just dueling banjos in the background for these two.

[02:49:30]  Wow.  Oh, they're calling it drooling banjos.  You're right, Steve.  Drooling banjos.  Uh-oh.  Voss is up two, uh, two nothing.  I'm up two.  How is he up two?  I only got one.  What are you talking about?  It's one nothing.  What did he get?  We didn't give him the Johnny cake.  Yeah, I think I was counting the Johnny cake.  Yeah, no.  It's one nothing.  I don't cheat.  That was the example.  Mars?  It's the Jew thing.  What's that?  He's giving him a extra one.  I just said I don't cheat.  Oh, look at the racists can't get along.  Oh, the racists can't get along.  Oh, the racists can't get along.  The Puerto Rican and the Jew.  Motherfucker.  I never said anything bad about it.  Never get along.  I know.  It's unbelievable.  Now his rent gets raised. 
[02:50:00]  There you go.  Just you're the landlord because you're Jewish.  That's what a fucking, uh, how honest I am.  All right.  Let's go to the next celebrity.  This is for Mars.  Danny's picking out some great celebrities today.  It's for Mars.  Mars, who is this?  Oh.  Just got married on The Office.  Big episode.  Yes.  Or is that tonight?  That's, uh, oh shit, that's, that's tonight.  Oh, I already saw it.  I didn't see it.  Saw it.  American, uh, office.  Yes.  American office.  I know the face, but I don't know the name.  Oh boy.  You want to steal, Rich? 
[02:50:30]  I don't even know.  Honestly, I don't know his name.  I'm not, I can't even know.  I know, I know the shoulders.  I don't know the name.  You want to write it down for Mars?  Okay.  Mars is very good at, uh, letting the audience in on.  Phonetic Mars.  Phonetic Mars will let everyone in on who we're talking about.  Maris.  I got it.  Danny's writing it down.  So, so the radio audience knows who we're talking about.  Mars will now read the name.  Drooling, drooling banjos. 
[02:51:00]  Oh.  Uh oh.  Mars just made a face when he saw the name.  There you go, Mars.  Tell everybody who it is.  John Kranciski.  Why?  That shouldn't seem right.  That's the point, you idiot.  He was looking at it.  It was written in front of him.  I'm telling you, this is the Jeopardy bit in SNL.  That's the same fucking bit.  It really is.  To have the name spelled out in front of you.  I'm going to let you see it again real quick.  Yeah. 
[02:51:30]  Okay.  There you go.  Real quick.  You don't even have to do it real quick.  Go ahead.  John Kranciski.  No.  I got that one.  Let me see it.  All right, Rich.  John Kranciski.  Isn't there an N in there?  Yeah.  Yeah, there's an N.  All right.  There we go.  There you go, Rich.  Rich Stanley.  John Kranciski.  Rich is still leading 1-0.  It's a battle.  It's my turn.  It's a battle of the nitwits.  Wait, wait.  How do you say it? 
[02:52:00]  John Kranciski.  You have to pronounce the N.  He did say Kranciski.  I did.  That's not it, though.  No.  K-R-A.  No, I mean, Rich said Kranciski.  Oh, I thought Voss got it.  I think he got it the first time, and then he fucked up and said Kranciski.  Sorry, he doesn't get it.  Whatever.  It doesn't matter.  I think it's a steal.  Sorry, your final answer.  All right, who's up next?  Rich?  Yeah.  Rich leading 1-zip.  Okay.  This is fucking too easy.  This is a very easy competition. 
[02:52:30]  1-0.  We've done 10 names already, I think.  Here comes the next celebrity.  Rich Voss is up.  Oh, yeah.  Wait a minute now.  She was Alec Baldwin's love interest on 30 Rock.  She's a, what is she, Mexican?  Latino?  What a great scene in Dusk Till Dawn, where she dances in the titty twister.  And being Hispanic, I think, or what is she?  Latino. 
[02:53:00]  Mexican.  Mexican?  Is she Mexican?  Thank you, Mars.  Mars is going to get this one.  She's kind of short, too.  This is not fair.  Mars has to get this one.  It's not even fair.  Wait, who goes first?  Selma Hayek.  He just winked at me, you fucking weirdo.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow, look at those giant breasts.  Yeah, they are pretty nice.  I guess Rich gets one, huh?  Rich gets it.  All right, Rich has got two.  Mars has zero.  That's fine. 
[02:53:30]  We're going to the next celebrity.  Mars is up.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  I'll say.  That's good.  Now we're just looking at semi-clad pictures.  I know.  Nothing wrong with that.  Hi.  Who is?  Why is Mars throwing his hands up in the air?  Because this is an easy one.  Rich has been getting the easy ones.  What are you talking about?  He's fucking up, too.  All right, this actress is known for her weight gain when she does those stupid movies. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, fucking.  Bridget Jones' Diary.  Right, right, right.  Oh, that's easy.  Bridget Jones' Diary.  All right, well, Mars is saying you're getting the easy ones.  That's easy.  All right, well, then Mars could get a point here.  Yeah.  That's it.  Bridget.  Yeah, that's about all I know her from.  Bridget Jones' Diaries.  She rhymes with a racial slur.  No, it doesn't.  It doesn't?  Oh, my God.  It does?  It does?  All right, go ahead. 
[02:54:30]  Mars, you got this one.  Come on, Mars.  Come on.  Rebecca.  Wait.  All right, Rebecca.  Rebecca.  Selma Rebecca Stamos.  Rebecca, good.  Swellinger.  Swellinger.  I think he just got us fired.  He said he reminds us.  He seemed to like the gentleman.  Wait a minute.  All right, Mars, again. 
[02:55:00]  We need a final answer.  You're close, my friend.  Can I see it, Bridget?  No, no.  Your final answer.  Because you're close.  You know it.  You just got to think it out.  Swellinger.  Swellinger.  Oh, my God. 
[02:55:30]  He sure is.  Wow.  Oh, you put the dumb and stupid.  And what was the first name again?  I don't speak wasp.  Rebecca, right?  Rebecca.  All right.  So, Rebecca Swellnigger is the name.  Okay. 
[02:56:00]  Okay.  Now, Rich, you get a chance to steal because that could not be more wrong in every way, shape, or form.  Ethically, morally, and phonetically.  Yes.  Rich.  Yeah.  Renee Swellwiger.  It is Renee Swellwiger.  Okay.  It's Wigger.  All right.  Go again.  Oh, we got to ask him about the one he got right five minutes ago.  What was it again?  Say that name again.  Oh, yeah.  Who was that? 
[02:56:30]  Oh, that was...  Don't say it, though.  That was Rebecca.  Oh, right.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  The Rebecca one again.  Rumgeon?  Right.  I told you.  Just give it five minutes.  You got it right, remember?  Goldfish brains.  Goldfish brains.  Roman.  Goldfish.  Roman.  Very good, Roman.  All right, now.  All right.  Goldfish.  It's three zip.  Rich is running away with this.  It's three zip, so I think that we should at least...  Rebecca Romulan. 
[02:57:00]  The score doesn't even matter.  It doesn't, but let's give Mars at least a chance to get a point.  Yeah, yeah.  So, I mean, I know he just went.  Voss is way ahead.  You wouldn't mind if we just give him one, see if he can get it.  Yeah.  Let's go for it.  What mash and pose picture up there?  Let's see what we can do.  Oh, hey, rape.  All right, the next...  All right.  All right.  Oh, yeah, this is very good, Danny.  You're right about this.  Now, look at this guy's ass.  We were just talking about this guy yesterday.  Yeah.  We were on the Jay Leno show with this guy. 
[02:57:30]  With this gentleman.  He was sitting on the couch with us.  He was in...  Sexiest Man Alive.  That horrible movie that I just saw where they went, like, scuba diving.  Oh, Girlfriends of, uh, what?  No, Ghost of Girlfriends Past was one of his latest movies.  He was in...  Uh, the one with Kate Hudson.  Yeah, that was the crappy one.  Yeah, which was, like, that other one, Gold Digger or Gold fucking Nugget.  What the hell is that?  And there's the other one where he's leaning on the girl on the cover.  Oh, that's a lot of those.  That's every cover. 
[02:58:00]  Matthew McConaughey.  What?  What?  Did someone study?  Could somebody, uh, say that again, please?  Matthew McConaughey.  Holy fuck.  I'll give it to him.  Wow.  Morris just farted, too.  Lost it.  You lost the shutout, Voss.  I gotta get the oxygen.  Holy shit.  I would have put money on that one.  No shit.  I would have, too.  All right.  Well, I'm out of names.  I mean, we could come up with more, I guess. 
[02:58:30]  Shit, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Do the chick from Hand the Rocks the Cradle or, um...  Rebecca De Mornay.  Thanks, Rich.  All right.  It's my turn.  Fuck, I'm trying to save time.  We got a big interview coming up.  We do have the big interview.  Yes.  We're late for the big interview.  They're listening, so I'm sure they're finding this just as amusing as we are.  All right, good.  We're going to get a mod suit.  Yes.  Hold tight there.  Who?  Let's see.  Is this? 
[02:59:00]  Oh.  We had her.  Very good.  Very good.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  She was in, um...  Fucking...  Yes, the, uh...  Trying to think of the latest movies.  What movies are those?  Resident Evil.  Resident Evil movies.  The Resident Evil movies.  I have no fucking idea.  She looks like a pretty Mackenzie Phillips.  Doesn't she?  A little?  Not at all.  No.  A pretty one?  No, not at all.  Well, then again, all four of you look like a pretty Mackenzie Phillips.  You can never use the word pretty and Mackenzie Phillips at the same time. 
[02:59:30]  Who's that guy going on?  You would never get a...  What?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, there's some...  There's some giant black woman on Maury.  Oh, Vaughn just threw a Patrice bash out there for no reason.  What did he do to you?  Who is that girl?  She's fucking hot.  Mars has got it.  Mars, we had her in a couple times.  Yeah.  She seems to enjoy the program.  No, go ahead.  I'll give it to you.  I'm going to pass to you.  Andrew Dice Clay interviewed her.  Resident Evil girl. 
[03:00:00]  Yep.  We can even write it down for you.  Oh, you could write it fucking down.  Don't worry about it.  And he would never get it.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  It's written for you.  Ready?  Jovo...  Jo...  It's her first name.  Yeah.  Mila?  Mila?  Mila?  Jovo...  Jovo...  Jovo...  Jovovnich.  Djokovnich.  Djokovnich. 
[03:00:30]  Djokovnich.  This is very uncomfortable.  Listening...  It's uncomfortable.  You use your tongue prettier than a $20 whore.  I'll still get it wrong if I read it.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Let him read it.  Let him read it.  Yeah.  All right.  Now he's reading it.  This is good.  Jovovnich.  Jovo...  Jovo...  Jovovich? 
[03:01:00]  Not even near?  Steve Rompejo's name.  Mila...  Jo Kockany.  Swell nigger.  It's going to make me laugh all day.  I mean, come on.  That is the best one ever.  That could be the line of the year.  Oh, that is fantastic.  That could be the line of the year.  Wow.  All right.  I think we're wrapping up.  Yeah, that's...  Do we have anybody else?  Yeah, hang on.  All right. 
[03:01:30]  How do you say it?  Hang on, hang on, hang on.  Oh, oh.  You mean this guy?  How do you say it?  Yeah, this one's from the Daily Show.  Well, he was on that Daily Show.  And then he has his own show.  He's got his own show.  That is after his name.  So we can't say that.  I recognize the face.  I don't know the name.  Do you want to read it?  That's too easy.  Do you know the girl?  You didn't know the girl?  No.  That was Mila Jovovich.  Jovovich.  Yeah, Jovovich.  Jovovich.  I couldn't say that anyhow without making a mistake. 
[03:02:00]  All right.  What about this guy?  Now, this gentleman?  I recognize him, but I don't know his name.  All right.  It's written for you.  Where?  I'll write it down.  All right.  A little writing down of this gentleman's name.  This gentleman, of course.  Very funny.  You got this, Rich?  Very funny, man.  I know the guy.  Stephen Colbert?  The L is silent.  Stephen Colbert.  Stephen Colbert? 
[03:02:30]  Just because you say it twice doesn't mean it's going to be right the second time.  Cigars has got Stephen Cold Beer.  Denver Pest Stephen Care Bear.  We're getting a request for the hero's chick.  Okay.  We can do that, too.  A couple requests coming in for the hero's chick.  You should get a good picture, too, because I want to enjoy this bit.  Hang on.  I watch this fucking every night.  Do you?  You like the heroes?  Well, don't blurt it out.  Well, I don't know her name.  Do you want to try it first, Rich?  No, I don't know her name.  Is it the little blonde?  Oh, my God.  Aggravating.  She's like the fucking... 
[03:03:00]  No, get the one with the hula hoop.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Her fucking character.  He reminds me of Jack Bauer's door on 24.  That's the same girl?  Jesus Christ.  That's a good picture of her.  Yeah, yeah.  Instead of showing off her gymnast legs.  She's fucking crying.  Mars?  Isn't it...  No, you already lost.  We're letting you run with us now.  Go ahead, Mars.  I bowed out.  You got it, Mars.  As a matter of fact, I surrender.  You won.  I gave it to you.  Again, I don't know her name. 
[03:03:30]  I don't even care.  All right, we're writing it down for you.  I don't even know how to spell it.  That's cool.  I get it.  I get it.  How old do you think she is?  Hey, just read that up there.  She has such a kissable tummy.  Yeah, you're going to be all right with this, Mars, because it's sort of...  Such a creep.  Hayden Panetari?  Wow.  It's pretty good.  It's kind of a Latin thing, almost.  Panetari.  What's the Space Museum by the Museum of Natural History called? 
[03:04:00]  The Planetarium.  What is it?  What do you mean what it is?  There's a name for it.  Hayden Planetarium.  All right, there you go.  I thought you'd say that for her name.  She is fucking...  She is hot.  I'm trying to think.  We got one more or we...  I think we might be done.  I'm done.  She is really hot.  Oh, yeah, I do have one more, actually.  This will be the last one.  Find a hot girl.  Got to get ready for the big interview.  Now, don't look.  Oh, no.  Just yet.  Oh, no. 
[03:04:30]  I think Voss might have a good try at this.  Yes.  No.  Something tells me that Mars might know it.  All right, here we go.  Mars.  Another guy that was on that 70s show.  Yep.  I played the dopey fucking foreign kid.  Yep.  And since then, he's just been annoying on, like, Punk'd and all sorts of other things.  I think they did the rap battle show or something, too.  All right, right.  No, the mama joke show. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  Mama.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Benny?  William.  William.  This is a bad one because it's a Hispanic name and I do not know it.  But you're Hispanic.  But you're probably related to him.  So you can't really show him the name because then he'll get it right because he knows how  to read Spanglish.  Barcelona.  William Valadarima.  Valadarima? 
[03:05:30]  William Valadarima.  Very good, Mars.  William Valadarima.  Very good.  Very good.  That's it?  Yeah.  Oh, pretty fucking good, man.  Oh, no.  Fuck no.  Oh, no, it's not.  You could try again on his first name if you want.  Yeah.  Didn't even get that one right.  It's not right?  No.  No, it's not William.  Oops.  Vilmia.  Can I see it?  No.  I don't know it.  What?  Voss's abs? 
[03:06:00]  Oh, I can't now.  Do you really want to show the abs to Mars?  This is...  Yeah!  Look at that, huh, Mars?  Yeah.  Mars is into it.  Mars goes, yeah.  Yeah, I don't know that guy.  I'll let you look at his name.  Yeah, but he's going to know it.  I'll let Mars finish on it.  Let's see if he can finish on a positive note.  I don't think he'll get it.  He will, because it's a Spanish name, isn't it?  Doesn't matter.  There you go.  Wilmer Valderrama. 
[03:06:30]  Valderrama.  Rich Corinthian leather.  I just wanted to buy that car.  Wilmer Valderrama.  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  I am from España.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Get ready for the big interview.  Yes.  Lita Ford and Jim Gillette will be joining the show next.  Yes.  Absolutely.  So hang in there.  Get your questions already, people.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  I'm sure you have plenty of questions.  Serious inquiries only.  Right. 
[03:07:00]  For this segment.  Yeah.  Why don't we do that?  We'll take a quick break.  Yeah.  You know what?  What's going on?  Eric from Maine is right.  How the fuck?  I did pick up on this.  How the fuck did you miss what Voss said?  When Mars was trying Stephen Colbert, Voss said the L is silent.  Oh, did he?  I did pick up on that.  I heard it, but I thought he was goofing.  I thought it not.  Oh, you thought he was goofing?  I swear, I just assumed he meant the T.  Sam, what's up?  Voss is on the phone.  Does he realize he's supposed to be on the show right now? 
[03:07:30]  What are you doing, Rich?  I'm wheeling and dealing.  Rich, who are you talking to?  I thought you said you were taking a break.  That's why I walked out.  Yeah, who are you talking to on the phone?  I got to pick out this guy that was doing video work for me.  Oh.  What did you say I said?  Nothing.  Forget it, Rich.  No, what the fuck?  Obviously, your phone call is more important than the radio show.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry we're taking time away from your phone right now.  Is that your rant?  Is that your last rant of the day?  Now smile.  No, I got a few others in here. 
[03:08:00]  All right.  We just had a killer segment, and I thought you'd go,  we're going to break because of the big interview.  How about you fucking wait until we actually go to break?  Oh, you're right.  I didn't even get my plugs.  That's how fucking stupid I am.  Wow.  I didn't say that this Friday I'll be in Manville at Rhythms  and Saturday at Bananas and Hasbrook Heights.  Here's the deal with Saturday.  I'm not fucking around.  I have to sell out two shows, okay?  I need to fucking hit a bonus in my life.  I got major fucking bills going down right now. 
[03:08:30]  There's a lot of shit.  Wait a minute.  I know what he's doing.  I am poverty over here.  Wait.  Right.  I know what you're doing.  Where is it?  Come on.  He is doing, Anthony, the 10-second tirade.  Oh, that's the 10-second tirade.  Remember, finish with a smile.  A smile.  All right.  And go.  All right.  Saturday night at Hasbrook Heights.  Can I please sell out two shows?  Can we get some listeners here?  You're going to have a great time.  The middle act is great.  Enough already.  Fucking take the word.  I'm funny. 
[03:09:00]  And the smile.  Very good, Rich.  Yeah.  Very good.  Now we could go to break.  Sorry I walked out.  It's okay.  I don't.  You really think I care?  No.  No.  No.  If everybody's just caught on fire in here, you would just sit as calmly as you always  do.  All right?  Sitting there.  What nose do I pick during the fire?  I don't pick as much.  I know.  You've got to update your material.  I know.  Oh, maybe I can take a picture of them in front of a sunset burning.  All right.  That's a good one. 
[03:09:30]  That's updating the material.  Very good.  All right.  Lita Ford and Jim Gillette next.  We'll see who mispronounces the more words.  All right.  Time for the big interview with Lita Ford and Jim Gillette making their way into the studio.  Fuck.  This guy could fuck us up.  Jim Gillette, Lita Ford.  How are you guys?  Fuck, man. 
[03:10:00]  God damn it.  You're not going to beat us up, are you?  I might.  You're a fucking big, scary dude.  280.  I'm sweet and petite.  280?  Yeah, I'm sweet and petite.  You're a solid 280?  I'm a dainty little flower.  I'm trained to kill.  I'm trained to kill.  I'm going to say, your appearance is a little different than it was when we saw your YouTube  rock screen.  Just a little, right?  Yeah.  That video was like a YouTube sensation.  We went with it, even.  I heard, and I had no idea about any of this.  One of our boys is on YouTube all the time, James. 
[03:10:30]  He's 12.  He said, Dad, did you see this?  There was like a couple million hits on it.  I was like, what the hell?  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  And all those tributes.  They were all his.  We did a bit called Rock Scream Tuesday just because of you, my friend.  That's funny.  Every Tuesday, they would call up with their rock screams.  That doesn't.  That's not you, though.  What year is that?  That is me.  That's him, man.  That's him.  I can tell by the crotch.  Yeah, I know.  What the fuck you got going on down there?  You got a big piece?  An armadillo's down the fucking thing. 
[03:11:00]  That is an armadillo in my pants.  Yeah.  And he's happy to see me.  Yes, he is.  God damn.  Now, this must have been during the rock years.  The nitro days.  Yes.  Yeah.  Can you do a rock scream for us just to kick off the interview?  Man, it's too early, buddy.  I'm dead.  We're not used to waking up this early.  Yeah.  Sleeping.  Sleeping kind of people.  You know what's funny is a couple years ago, we'd be up probably when you guys were up.  I'd be up at 5, 6 o'clock.  You would just be going to bed, right? 
[03:11:30]  But now it's reversed back when we're in rock.  You know, we're going to bed at 3, 4 a.m. and getting up at noon.  Wait, you were a rock star and now you're a fucking fighter?  Something like that, yeah.  We live in a deserted island in the Caribbean.  For real?  For real.  So when the sun goes down, we go to bed.  When the sun comes up, we get out of bed.  What island?  How about this?  It's an island.  What's close by?  Gillette's Island.  Yeah, it's like Gilligan's Island.  No shit.  It's just your own.  There's more palm trees than people. 
[03:12:00]  Wait, you bought your own island?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can do that, I hear.  Yeah.  How much for an island?  We got a lot of land, man.  Got a good deal on it.  Yeah.  No, but it's expensive.  How do you get over to it?  You got a boat and shit?  Yeah.  No.  It might be a fucking bridge.  Can we swim?  Wait a minute.  They might have made a crosswalk.  An island, stupid.  Oh, really?  Wait.  It's hard to comprehend.  It really is.  Wait, where was Manhattan?  It's literally like Gilligan's Island.  Wait, with all due respect, where did you get all the money to buy an island? 
[03:12:30]  I know you did well, but...  I bought and sold a lot of land.  Oh, you know that business, huh?  A little land baron.  Yeah.  I'm pretty good at it.  What about utilities?  How do you get all the water and stuff?  We've got our own water plant, and we've got a well.  We put in this water plant, and we don't need it.  We collect in SimCity.  We collect rainwater.  You collect rainwater?  We get enough rainwater off the roof, and we've got a shallow freshwater well, so we  spent all this money on a dam.  Why don't you just live in the United States and kind of just... 
[03:13:00]  We do.  ...tax reasons?  We're back and forth.  Have you ever seen...  No, no tax reasons.  Have you ever seen abs like this?  Yeah!  That's amazing.  Rich, it's enough.  Sorry, he's...  I'm just asking.  On your island, will you get...  Island of Dr. Moreau, maybe.  He's trying to give me nightmares?  He's a little slow.  He's a little slow.  Just go with it.  A little hairy guy with abs.  Waking me up at three in the morning.  I got cold sweat.  No!  He's a little slow. 
[03:13:30]  I want to get into this island thing.  You've got kids, though.  Isn't that kind of selfish to the kids?  Do they have people they can play with?  Selfish?  They've got the coolest life on the planet.  Where do they go to school?  Their friends are UFC fighters.  Their friends are rock stars.  We've got their trainers are the Gracies.  The Howard Davis Jr., Olympic boxing champion.  They have an incredible life.  Okay.  Do the Harlem Globetrotters occasionally wash up on the island and play and then get rescued?  Not that I know of, but I'm not going to say that. 
[03:14:00]  Like you really think they could swim.  You know what's funny?  Rich always has to.  The island people, a lot of them do not swim.  How do you live on an island all your life?  It's only an island from the water.  You never see them on the beach.  The beaches are absolutely desolate.  Really?  Your footprints are the only ones in the sand.  Did you ever notice that during the hardest times in your life there was only one set of footprints?  And I said, Lord, why are there only one set of footprints?  And he goes, because you're such an asshole that I ditched you. 
[03:14:30]  I left you behind.  It was because you were so drunk and I had to carry you home.  You were drunk.  Your abs scared me away.  Yeah, your hairy little abs.  It's furry little abs.  Hey, why are you wearing a sweater under your t-shirt?  Don't think you should be laying down nursing puppies with that belly.  Nothing.  I'll take a bomb.  Hold on.  That's a bad one.  I agree.  Fucking great artwork. 
[03:15:00]  Look at all that.  A lot of tats between the two of you.  On him.  Oh, yeah.  I'm seeing his.  You want to see him naked and rich?  When you have tats, it's called artwork.  Look, you're a Jewish guy with tats.  That's fucking against the law.  See, look, a Jewish guy with tats.  Showing you something you probably haven't seen before.  A tattooed star of David.  Like, who did that?  Who actually said, all right?  I did.  Showing that you're not allowed to, you're not really supposed to tag yourself up.  Oh, really?  Tattoo artists have morals?  Really?  Where would you like the SS sign?  Really?  Mine? 
[03:15:30]  You mean the one I got?  Perfect.  It's right back here on my show.  So, are you guys like the king and the queen of the island?  Do the natives really look up to you like, oh, shit.  They're scared shitless of us.  Yeah, I bet.  They think we're, you know.  They work for Jim, actually.  The mafia or something.  He's got about 100 and something people that work for him.  On the island?  Doing what?  Yep.  Developing land.  Cocaine.  Doing cocaine?  No, I mean shipping it.  Actually, they used to do that.  They did.  It was an island that they used. 
[03:16:00]  It was in a movie.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, not anymore.  I think they've been busted.  Boy, I have a question.  If it's your island, were they there first?  Or you bought the island, built on it, and then imported workers?  Both.  You mean there was natives on the island, and you decided just to move there?  Yes.  They're slave trading.  What the fuck were you nervous?  There's approximately 1,500 people that live on the island.  Do I look like the kind of guy that gets nervous?  Not really.  I mean, honestly?  No, probably no.  What's he getting nervous about?  Huh?  He hires people?  God. 
[03:16:30]  What, a blowgun?  A blowgun?  What year is this?  They went from being terrified of us because, you know, we built this castle on the beach,  and they thought we were like Scarface.  And then we hired them all and trained them how to build bridges, roads, you know, underground  utilities.  You really are playing The Sims, but in like real life.  No, it was that other game.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like Sim City.  No, the word.  People don't comprehend.  For the government.  Tropico.  Tropico, yeah.  Tropico.  We don't know any of these games because we've been on the desert.  Oh, it's okay.  Don't worry about it. 
[03:17:00]  They are hungry.  How fucking cool is that?  They're developing their own island.  You got any defense?  Missile defenses?  What do you got?  What do you got?  Patriot missiles?  What kind of government you got?  Honestly, we don't need anything.  Yeah, what kind of government?  We got a hammer.  We won.  Hammer?  That's it.  Just a hammer.  I have Jim.  I don't need anything else.  All they got to do is pull out fire and everybody's scattered.  He said, just wake me up.  I'll take it from here.  Like, what is that considered as far as the government goes?  The British?  The British?  Yeah.  The Brits?  In the Caribbean.  Where are they at?  Which I am British.  And they don't come by that often, right? 
[03:17:30]  No.  You're down near Turks and Caicos, I think.  No.  Farther south.  Farther south.  Cayman Islands?  South.  South.  South of Cayman Islands.  Cayman Islands ain't that south.  Well, it's kind of...  Cayman Islands is more west.  Australia?  Okay.  No, British Virgin Islands.  Yeah.  In that area?  Way down there, yeah.  In the chain.  No golf courses?  No, no, no.  Only a volcano.  Yeah?  You got a little volcano on there?  That's where we live, in the volcano.  That's kind of cool.  Hey, speaking of volcanoes, I erupted last night pretty good. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, damn.  You guys have a lot of sex?  Oh, damn.  A lot of that?  Yeah, every day.  Do you have a sex swing?  Absolutely.  And we use it regularly.  We don't get it.  I can't even lie.  We don't get the sex swing thing.  You don't get the sex swing thing?  Are you insane?  Explain it.  I've never done the sex swing.  I weigh 120 pounds.  He weighs almost 300 pounds.  Right.  Okay, so I have 300 pounds on top of me, right?  I practically need a snorkel to get through it.  Of molten hot man meat.  Wow.  Are you done yet?  So he sticks me in the swing, and I have no weight on me. 
[03:18:30]  It's really cool.  Now, what does it work?  Do you spin around in it?  You sit in it, right?  Over the bed, or is it a different...  You've got the straps.  You've got the legs in it.  It's pretty sweet.  The straps, it's a beautiful swing, and hangs in our bedroom.  And how do you get, like, up and down?  You know, because you've got to kind of...  No, we've got it set.  We've got it chained at the right height.  Oh, at the right height?  It's adjustable.  You've got to arch your back, I guess, and kind of, you know, get up there. 
[03:19:00]  No, it's perfect.  You know what's funny?  It's kind of a kinky thing.  It's a bondage thing.  You need some movement, I'd say.  Oh, yeah.  If he's in there, and you're just hanging on a swing, and he's sitting there...  I don't breathe.  But I mean, does the chair spin around?  You need some kind of movement.  No, no, no, no, no.  It's hanging by chains.  I understand, but if his dick is in you, let me be blunt.  He's fucking you.  Right?  You're on the swing.  Without going, like, him moving... 
[03:19:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's like this.  She's like this.  It's not like this.  I thought you were sitting in, like, a chair.  Back in the chair.  Now it makes sense.  It's like she's at the gynecologist.  All right.  That kind of thing.  Perfect.  Easy access.  It's like when you get a guy in a wheelchair to blow you.  You roll that way, I roll this way.  Jesus.  That way, this way.  You know what's funny, though, is it's the kinky thing.  It's the bondage thing.  But it actually would be great for older people.  Yeah?  Yeah, because there's no weight.  You don't get, you know, stiff or messed up. 
[03:20:00]  Can't crack a hip or something like that.  Yeah, exactly.  Is that picture accurate so you stand up, Jim?  It's not that kind, but that's the idea.  Ours is a lot cooler.  That's sex swing.  Ours is cool.  Ours is from Stockroom.  Stockroom.com.  Okay.  Pull it up, man.  Yeah, pull up Stockroom.  Look at that.  We've got our own page on there.  Yeah, there it is.

You take the clamps?  She spanks the shit out of me.  How long have you been hooked up together, you two?  15 years.  15 years.  Wow.  We got married after two weeks.  We knew each other two weeks.  There's no codependent issues there.  Got married on Friday.  There was, actually.  He talked the guy into waving the 72-hour waving period. 
[03:21:00]  Really?  In Texas, yeah.  Hey, there it is.  That's the swing you use?  Oh, that's the one?  That's the kind of the thing.  That's it.  Not bad, is it?  Okay.  Now I get it.  Can you see why we're into the swing?  Now I get it.  Do you see why we're into the swing now?  Now I get it.  I didn't understand.  I thought you were sitting a little more, you know, like in a chair kind of a thing.  No.  Old school.  We have that, too.  Old school.  Yeah, we have that.  We have the one where you sit down and it's got like a, I don't know, a seat on the left  and the right, so the entire crotch area's open.  Uh-huh.  You just sit under and she's like, that's nice. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, there you go.  That's nice.  That sounds pretty cool.  Cradle it so he can get under it.  I'm going to get one of those for my wife.  Maybe she'll fuck up and hang herself.  That's terrible.  He's heading toward a divorce.  You've always been a little kinky there.  That's a healthy marriage.  Yeah, he's miserable.  You've got to give us some tips on how to stay so happy.  You want to give him some advice?  Because he's miserable.  They don't have sex anymore.  Yes, we do.  Here's a couple.  They've been married 15 years and she has sex every day.  You know what?  We were trying to figure out who we needed to give our gift to.  Okay?  Rich, you get the gift. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, Rich.  This may help you.  This will help, Rich.  This is no fucking way.  Really?  Should I look at it?  I can't believe that's rock screen.  Let me tell you, my wife.  I know.  That's weird.  It's the same guy.  He ate the band.  She might throw it at you.  Should I look at it?  No, man.  He is pinned.  Tell her it's from us.  There you go, Rich.  Oh, the rabbit.  Oh, fuck.  I'd be damned if she gets to use this.  Are you going to put it up your ass?  Let it tickle your balls?  Well, explain what it is, Rich.  Look at this.  It's a fucking...  It's the rabbit.  This is a big vibrator with an angle. 
[03:22:30]  That's a small one.  With an...  That's a small one.  That's a small one?  For Rich, that's giant.  I'm a wall.  Oh, look.  He's all nervous.  He spilled his coffee.  He spilled the coffee.  You fucking bitch.  Look at that fucking thing, man.  What's this shit right there?  It spins around.  It spins around.  It spins around?  Yeah.  And this is for the butt?  No, that's for the clit.  Because my wife has a flat ass.  Tickles.  Tickles the clit.  When I fuck it from behind, I feel like I'm fucking Jackie Chan's face.  Stick your clit in the middle. 
[03:23:00]  That was a joke.  That was one of my jokes.  I understand.  Rich has no clue how that fucking thing works.  Oh, I put this in and this dittles the clit?  Yes.  And this...  What's this on the bottom?  The power cord?  Yeah, that's the...  Remote control.  So if I have her use this in the bathtub, is there a chance of her getting electrocuted?  Fuck, for real?  Can I take it?  I'm going to take it out.  Hold on.  Do you want to use it, Rich, on yourself right now?  He doesn't have a clit.  Wow, look at that.  I can't.  How do I follow this? 
[03:23:30]  If she gets used to this, what the fuck am I going to do?  The black guy she's usually with will follow.  Oh, gee.  Giant.  That's it.  That's a big one.  Oh, and it's got those little beads in there that rotate, huh?  Well, that's all the features.  Rich, you like your gift?  Do I like my gift?  I can't wait to get in a car and try it.  That's from our wonderful endorsers.  Stockroom.  Stockroom.com. 
[03:24:00]  Stockroom.com getting some nice plugs in there.  Hey, pull up the Lita page on it, man.  Oh.  What's the Lita page all about?  We're going to talk about the new album.  Stockroom.com slash Lita Ford.  You want to call Bonnie and tell her what you're bringing home?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's get Bonnie on the phone so she could appreciate.  This is the Lita Ford page on Stockroom.com.  What are we looking at, Jim?  All leathered out?  You never know.  Bonnie may dig that.  What?  Her number?  Yeah, her number.  Oh, I got it. 
[03:24:30]  What?  Just saying.  You're going to get him paranoid thinking you do.  No kidding.  I'll have to deal with that for a call later.  If you ever get one open.  That was for the show, right?  You don't really have Bonnie's your number.  It's because he said that he has your number.  What are we looking at, Jim?  Help us through the Lita Ford page.  That's our bedroom.  Some very nice pictures.  That's our bedroom.  Wow.  You got a whole...  It's like Cirque du Soleil in that bedroom.  Yes, it is.  And that, guys, honestly, that is the best advice for a marriage we can give you.  Really? 
[03:25:00]  If you have sex every single day with your spouse, how do you get divorced?  How do you not...  How do you stray?  How do you, you know, if you're fucking every day, for God's sake...  Because you want to fuck someone else?  Why?  I don't know.  It's not interesting.  That's because the one you're with isn't good.  It's not into the marriage thing.  No, no, no.  You're right.  What if you just want to fuck two people, and then as you're fucking the two people,  the little time goes by, and you want to kind of phase out the initial one. 
[03:25:30]  Whoops.  Whoops.  Whoopsie.  Let's just say that might have happened.  That'll cost you.  Oh, this is fucking...  I like these guys, man.  You like that fucking dildo, don't you?  No, I just like the whole concept.  Oh, Bonnie's on the line.  Have you been kinky your whole life there, a little kink, or has he brought in the kink  in your life?  He's brought in a lot of kink in my life, yeah.  I have been kinky, yes, but not as kinky as...  Brought it out, huh?  Yeah.  So Mr. Kinky over here brought it out.  Hold that thought, because we've got Bonnie on the line. 
[03:26:00]  This is not what it really costs, though.  Rich.  Bonnie.  Bonnie.  Rich is very excited.  I'll have Rich talk to you here.  There's two guests in studios.  What's their names?  A killer and hotcakes.  Killer and hotcakes.  They're singers and wrestlers, and fucking, they run a porn.  They're...  All I know is they gave us a gift.  He's so articulate on the radio.  Isn't he terrific, right?  They gave us a gift, and it's, you could tell Rasheem to go, to leave now, because what 
[03:26:30]  I'm going to bring home, it's a purple vibrator, one of your favorite colors, with a...  Same color as your penis.  With a clit diddler and a power cord and instructions.  It's fucking nice.  It's worth 138 bucks.  And massages your clit at the same time.  It massages your clit, and, and, but you can't go all the way...  I'm surprised, I'm surprised you're pronouncing that correctly. 
[03:27:00]  And, uh, it's, it's beautiful.  So what I'm saying is, uh, do some kegels before I get home, and, uh...  How much do you think Bonnie can take of that?  How much can Bonnie take of this?  Yeah.  If you say she's funny, the whole thing.  Uh, no, she could probably...  Bonnie's, Bonnie's...  You're totally dying.  I'm not fucking...  I killed all morning, all right?  You did kill all morning.  It's gotta be sad.  All right, Bonnie, Bonnie's, like, with me, Bonnie goes, ow, that's what a great actress 
[03:27:30]  she is.  Uh, this is gonna get up to the beads right here.  That's a lot.  She's, Bonnie's, like, kinky, prudy.  Like, we'll watch a porno, but she covers her eyes, and goes, ooh, ooh, right, on the close-up  shots and stuff, right?  What?  But she goes, ooh, ooh.  I like porno radio, that's what...  Why would you do that?  Yeah, why do you go, ew?  Because it's too close-up.  It's too much anatomy for me. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, you're one of these, like, you don't really like the human form?  You don't like the sex parts?  No, I don't want to see, like, some of those girls, their butt reminds me of, like...  You know when you're practicing batting, and the balls come out of that thing?  That's what I think of it.  Like, you don't like gaping, right?  You don't like when people are gaping?  Who the fuck are you?  Where it looks like people's asses are singing opera.  Who you going bat...  Yeah, look at that, that's Pavarotti's mouth right there.  That's not an ass. 
[03:28:30]  Who you going batting with?  You went batting with somebody?  Oh, look at him.  Now comes the paranoia.  He always thinks his chick is fucking someone else.  He doesn't believe his kid is his.  Sometimes he's not.  They have a kid together, and Rich isn't convinced that it's his kid.  For real.  I don't want to get into that now.  All I know is we have a new toy, so tonight...  All I know.  He's like a five-year-old.  Tonight between hero episodes...  Are you starting to believe that it's your kid, Rich?  It doesn't matter.  I love the baby no matter what.  See?  He doesn't believe it.  I love the baby.  The kid looks like Rich Voss.  They have the exact same eyes.  Blood shot and beaten down. 
[03:29:00]  Oh, look at Bonnie.  Look at Bonnie.  There's a picture of Bonnie that just got up there, and she looks like, from the cast  of Newsies, she looks like she should be saying, extry, extry, read all about it.  Yeah.  Talk in the 40s voice.  Talking to...  Hitler dead.  We got a lot of news today.  Hitler killed outside his bunker.  It's adorable.  It's a very cute look for you, Bonnie.  No, show the one with the ass.  Well, there's a picture of her with her ass sticking out. 
[03:29:30]  Oh, is there?  Oh, wow.  He always criticizes your ass.  He says you don't have an ass.  No, the other night it was round, right?  Remember how round it was?  I've been working on it for you, Rich.  How does it get round?  How does it get round one night?  See, look at that.  She's working on her ass for you.  We get along great.  My wife and I get along.  We laugh.  We have a good time.  They never near each other.  He's always on the road.  If he loved me, it would be perfect.  I do love my wife.  Now, what about this dildo thing? 
[03:30:00]  Would you be into using this?  It's got a little thing on the side that'll diddle your clit, and then it's got these beads  inside of it that rotate around, yeah, around like your opening and your G-spot, and then  it's got, you know, your opening, your vulva.  Your vulva.  We'll use it a couple times.  If you don't like it, then we'll put it on Craigslist.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Ask her about the sex swing. 
[03:30:30]  We've got Lita Ford and Jim Jelani's studio.  Oh, yeah, there's a sex swing here, too.  And they use the sex swing.  And the swing, and plus, Raina can play with it in a day, because it's a swing.  You can also hang plants.  You can hang plants.  Oh, yeah, our kids sit in our swing.  Oh, no, they don't.  They do.  Yeah, they do.  They come in our room, and they sit there, and they get the remote control, and they'll  hang it.  Do they know what it is?  Yeah.  We don't hide nothing from them.  They don't get, we don't get graphic, but we say, you know, that mommy and daddy use  that when we have sexy time.  She'll rel the children afterwards.  It's clean. 
[03:31:00]  All right.  Yeah, what's wrong?  It's just mommy and daddy.  Where do you think they came from?  The little squirts?  Well, that's true.  Quite literally.  All right.  Bonnie, you want a sex swing?  Because we've got a website and everything.  You can pick one out.  A sex swing?  Okay, I'll, yeah, yeah.  I mean, look who I'm married to.  Of course I want a sex toy.  See, it's a swing, and you lay down in it.  You lay down in it.  Rich stands there and kind of just blasts you.  My luck, I mean, I'd push her back and forth, and her head would go through the fucking  sheet rock in the other room. 
[03:31:30]  We don't have a big place.  We've done that before, too.  You've done that?  I would happily say that this wall is made out of concrete block.  Yeah, yeah.  It was concrete block.  Wow.  Wow.  What's the craziest thing you guys have done, sexually, that you're willing to admit?  God, I think we're about doing it.  We do, we pretty much will do, we will do, we've got two rules, no other people and no  animals.  Besides that, it's pretty much-  No animals?  No animals.  Sorry.  Bonnie's all pumped out. 
[03:32:00]  Bonnie's doing a pedestrian area.  Bonnie's getting all mad now.  No animals.  No barnyard animals.  I'm sorry, my chihuahua just doesn't cut it.  I know what a farm is.  It's a staple.  But what's the crazy thing you guys have done?  Well, what's crazy?  I don't know.  What's your definition?  Toys.  Just using toys.  Do you, Lita, do you, Jim?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  We don't understand that one.  Well, which one?  Jim Norton is kind of like trying that a little bit.  What's that?  The strap-on.  Jim is trying that?  Yeah.  What do you mean, he's having girls put on strap-ons and banging him? 
[03:32:30]  Well, he tried it.  He tried.  It was a great story on the show.  And it got in like-  A little bit.  He said like a corner of an inch, and it was like ow, and he said he felt like he had  to take a dump.  You guys are so fucking easily fooled.  One, it wasn't a strap-on.  Two, he didn't say ow.  He went, wow.  And Jolene's name was not Jolene, it was Joe.  I'm sorry.  You don't think we just go along with it, Rich?  Yeah, we understand.  We understand.  I fucking-  It's the henna head. 
[03:33:00]  But that's got to be-  All right.  Well, Lita, you have a belt?  Of course.  With the little attachment?  Of course.  And Jim, you like that?  I like everything.  He's a man.  You know what's funny?  You know what's funny?  I love-  This is strange.  This isn't crazy or that weird.  But for me, I love her feet now.  Really?  Like a year ago, I started going nuts on her feet.  And I mean, I like go down on her feet.  Really?  Yeah.  Sometimes she can't get me off them, you know? 
[03:33:30]  I just want to keep going.  Got a foot fetish out of nowhere?  He's got a foot fetish.  Yes.  And we don't know where that came from.  And a friend of ours, not mentioning any names, has a shoe fetish.  Yes.  And he's about the same age as you.  So it must be, you know, he's trying different things.  Shoes.  I've jerked off in shoes before.  But Bonnie's feet, like she has one toenail that's rotten.  And it's like completely fucking-  It kind of ruins it.  Give the character.  Give the character.  It gives the character.  And sometimes the fake nail will fall off and you'll see it on the floor.  And you know in the bed there's a rotten fucking toe laying there. 
[03:34:00]  Covered in fungus.  What's wrong with you, Bonnie?  It's not what's wrong with me.  Just cut it off.  Cut the toe off.  It's fucking horrific.  It looks like her toe is a burn victim.  Bonnie, what happened?  Bonnie, what happened?  My toe nail fell off from jogging.  And my toe?  So then I'm trying to grow it back in and it-  You're jogging on grenades?  What happened? 
[03:34:30]  It just rubs on my shoe.  I don't know.  It got gross and it fell off.  And my left toe doesn't work.  My pinky toe doesn't work.  It just lays flat on my foot.  It's the most disgusting thing.  What?  My pinky-  Look it.  Okay, we've already seen his abs.  Now we're seeing his-  Oh my God!  What the-  What the-  What the-  What the-  What the-  I can't move my pinky toe.  Look!  It just lays.  What the hell?  Dude, stop this. 
[03:35:00]  Stop this.  I've seen some ugly feet in my life.  You're scaring the women and children.  Look at it.  Look at it.  The toe is like paralyzed.  Right there.  Pinky toe.  When you do this little piggy one to market, when you get to that, it goes, meh.  Oh, see here's the difference.  You have a stroke toe.  What?  All right.  See?  See that?  See how my toes go?  That's normal.  That's normal.  You got a normal toe.  I can't move the left.  I've got a paralyzed pinky toe.  If I were you, I wouldn't be complaining about your wife's toenail. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, my God.  Damn, that is sick.  Yeah, what the fuck?  I've never told you my toe before.  Well, I'm so glad we finally got to see it.  We're getting to see every part of Rich one piece at a time.  Wear one sock.  You mean that guy's not going down on Rich's foot?  Nah, nah.  Sometimes I'll rub my dead toe.  Oh, you'll rub your dead toe on her leg.  On her scab-stricken fucking foot.  You guys are a match made in fungus.  She says to me, give me a foot massage I put on asbestos gloves. 
[03:36:00]  Asbestos.  You know what we do that's kind of cool?  What, Bonnie?  Is that it's her foreplay?  She'll scratch my hemorrhoid.  Nice.  Oh, fucking A.  That's your man's man.  You guys are still unsexy.  No.  You can't even feel it?  Well, if I pinch it, but it has no fucking power.  What did you do to it?  I didn't do anything.  It grew that fucking way.  I don't know.  Like, was that your whole life?  I don't remember when it happened.  You should remember when all of a sudden your pinky toe doesn't fucking work. 
[03:36:30]  You never have to work.  You're never going, oh, my pinky toe's not working because my foot is fucking working.  So I'm not checking my...  Look, you know if your pinkies aren't working because you're using them.  But you'd feel like I'd be numb and not move.  Did you...  Is it because of you smoking crack back in the day?  You lost your toe?  No.  Rich used to smoke the crack.  He's clean and sober for how many years?  23 years.  Going on 24 years.  Very nice.  Isn't that great?  You guys party or you're done with all the partying? 
[03:37:00]  Oh, enough with the clapping.  I know.  This isn't a fucking meeting.  You guys cleaning your party or what?  Oh, me?  No, I do nothing.  Nothing?  I'm boring.  He drinks a little bit of champagne at night after everybody goes to bed.  That's a crazy issue.  He sits here with a bottle of champagne and he just writes lyrics and has a sip and makes  phone calls and gets on the computer and plays with himself and all that good stuff.  Yeah, round two after I've taken care of her.  Yeah.  He puts me to bed first. 
[03:37:30]  And then you get up and, you know, a little bit of computer action.  Yes.  Isn't that great?  Yes.  Isn't the computer the best thing that ever was invented?  It's the best and the worst because you get addicted to the damn thing, you know?  Yeah.  You just have to run around and, like, find magazines as a kid.  It says that in SOB.  We have a song called Patriotic SOB and talks about porn in SOB.  That's something you could sink your teeth into there, yeah.  Where is the SOB song?  Is it off the new album?  Patriotic SOB.  Patriotic SOB.  What the fuck is that one?  That's got some fun lyrics in it.  That's got some fun lyrics in it. 
[03:38:00]  Third track.  It's badass, yeah.  Lita Ford's new album is Wicked Wonderland.  Bonnie.  Oh, Bonnie?  Nah, she hung up.  I told her I would call her later.  Piss of her toe?  Huh?  She probably got upset.  I can't imagine.  I mean, she was getting so turned on by your toe talk, you know?  Rich, we're talking about the new fucking CD now?  I wanted to say to get the CD.  I was telling her to order it online.  Now, you contributed to this project?  To this project, sir?  Yes.  Are you singing?  Okay.  Yep.  Rock screaming?  Singing and writing and producing and screwing to get, you know, better takes. 
[03:38:30]  All on the island?  You got a studio there?  Oh, I get it.  She's putting on the special belt with the fucking attachment, and that's how you get the rock  screaming.  Actually, no.  No.  That came after the rock screaming.  I didn't know him then when he was doing those rock screaming.  Do you fight in tournaments?  No.  I was going to go to the UFC, and she wanted to do this, and I started training the kids  more, because I'm good, but my kids can be way better.  They started when they were two years old. 
[03:39:00]  We've got videos of them doing triangle chokes, arm bars when they're two years old.  My eight-year-old could put you to sleep.  He'll literally choke you to sleep, yeah.  It's just fucking radio show.  I was just going to throw a Rich Boss fucking joke in there.  Really?  They're beasts.  Is he a big guy for eight?  Yeah, he's big for eight, and my 12-year-old is bigger than me.  90 pounds at eight, and the 12-year-old's 130 pounds.  So no one fucks with them?  No.  No, but they're huge kids, and they're awesome at jiu-jitsu. 
[03:39:30]  They're awesome at boxing.  James is 12, and he spars 15, 16-year-old kids.  Do they weight lift at that age?  Do they lift?  No.  I won't have them lift weights.  They have a rock wall they climb that's like a treadmill, but it's a rock wall, so you can't  get to the top.  They've got 40-foot-long monkey bars that go up and down.  They climb ropes that are huge.  We actually have an octagon.  Wait, no weights?  Where people wrestle.  No, it's all body weight stuff.  All body weight stuff. 
[03:40:00]  What do you have against weights?  The kids don't use weights.  I don't think kids are supposed to lift weights.  Oh, they're just too young?  No.  They're too young.  Yeah, they have to be 18, I think, don't they?  Because it has something to do with their body growth and shit.  No, not 18.  Growth plate, yeah, it shuts them down.  We're doing everything to make them as big and strong as they can.  They don't wake up at a certain time.  Popping steroids in their ass, shit like that.  Oh, yeah, for sure.  Yeah, you've got to roid them up.  Wait, you let them sleep in?  We don't do that, man.  They don't need that.  You're kidding?  They wake up when they wake up.  Hey, you laugh.  My kid will come in here and put you in a choke lock.  If our keyboard player is listening, you wouldn't be able to speak. 
[03:40:30]  When James was 11 years old.  They're actually here.  Really?  When James was 11 years old, he tapped out, submitted our keyboard player three times a  grown man.  Really?  He was 11 years old.  Is the 8-year-old here?  Yeah.  He's in town, but he's not here.  Oh, man, I want to see him take on Rich Fox.  He's in town, but he's not here.  What's an 8-year-old doing in the city?  No, no, they'll be here tonight.  Closing some business deals.  Not fucking fighting an 8-year-old with guns and snakes.  Take on the 8-year-old.  Oh, really?  So now I've got to get in my car, take out the inside passenger door handle, and fight 
[03:41:00]  an 8-year-old.  Get it?  You want us to bring him in and have you choke him?  No, I'm not fucking fighting a kid.  You don't have to fight him.  You'd be asleep.  The keyboard player lost three times.  Michael T. Ross, he says to me, that was the dumbest thing I've ever done.  And I said, yeah, it was.  And he said, because if I would have won, I would have been an asshole for beating up  a kid.  And now I look like a pussy, because I got my ass kicked three times.  That's how the kid fight Mars.  The kids aren't here, though.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, you should have brought him in.  We could have done a little sparring today.  They spar Jenna, oh, God, I can't remember the girl's name. 
[03:41:30]  She's a UFC champion.  No, not UFC, Bodog.  What's her name?  Jennifer, is it Jennifer?  Tilly.  Jessica.  Jessica Aguilar.  Oh, okay.  She's a professional MMA fighter.  Our 12-year-old spars with her.  Wait, girls do that shit, too?  Yeah, man.  Oh, yeah, the girls get it.  I told my son, I said, don't be afraid to hit a girl, because she's in boxing.  If she didn't want to be hit, she wouldn't be a boxing pro.  Or she wouldn't talk.  That's what I, yeah. 
[03:42:00]  So, he's holding back a little bit.  That's my philosophy.  The fucking dinner's burned, you know?  If she didn't want to get hit, she wouldn't have burned dinner.  That's a different situation.  Is it?  Yeah.  Definitely.  Maybe then I shouldn't.  Yeah, it's for sport.  Because if you hit me for burning dinner, I'd nail you with a frying pan.  Oh, shit.  Watch out.  See, I might be into that, though.  Watch out.  Yeah, right.  Maybe with a frying pan on the nuts.  Hey, what's a spanking with a frying pan?  A hot one.  A spanking with a frying pan.  They're like the fucking coolest couple on the planet. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah, they are.  You guys are all right.  You'll see my family in your life.  Fucking cool.  Fucking making music and have kids that kick ass.  Yeah, Lena, you took a lot of time off.  You got back in in 2008, right?  Yeah.  What took you so long?  Yeah.  I've been raising my kids.  You decided to raise the kids, do a little family thing?  She's the teacher, man.  Yeah.  We homeschooled.  I had my first album out when I was 16.  Jesus.  And in 1995, I was what?  I don't know how old I was.  I got bored.  I was 20, no, 40. 
[03:43:00]  She's been doing it for over 20 years, nonstop, you know?  So I was pretty bored.  I had done the music industry for 27 years.  That's what it was.  And then I got pregnant with James.  And I got bored.  I just wanted to get out of the music industry for a little while, not for 15 years.  And Jim and I moved to the Caribbean.  We had two sons.  And I wanted to raise my kids.  I wanted to raise my kids.  Not a nanny.  Not a babysitter.  I didn't want to put them in daycare. 
[03:43:30]  I wanted to do it myself.  I wanted to teach them.  I don't want somebody else teaching my kids.  You know?  Did you hang out with, like, major, like, I mean, you said you're from England.  Did you know, like, any of those, like, Mick Jagger or any of those fucking people?  She knew everybody.  Absolutely.  Really?  She knew everybody.  Roger Daltrey and shit like that.  I'm 51 years old.  My first album out of 71.  The Ramones used to open up for her band.  Oh, really?  Cheap Trick used to open up for her band.  Tom Petty.  Tom Petty used to open.  I mean. 
[03:44:00]  Open.  Yeah.  They would open the show for her.  So you fucking hung out with, like, the fucking.  She knows Ozzy.  I had a top ten hit single with Ozzy.  Yeah.  It was his biggest song.  Close your eyes.  Yeah.  You both had the same hair.  Big, flowing, like.  He was best rock.  The 80s version of Ozzy was pretty funny with that.  Someone's saying you don't like Sharon, though.  Is that true?  I love Sharon.  I think Sharon's.  Did you have a little problem with her?  No.  Not with Sharon Osbourne.  She helped me a lot. 
[03:44:30]  She put me on the best tours I'd ever been on.  And she taught me a lot of things about the music industry.  But I think she's pretty cool.  She is.  She has another side to her, I think, that a lot of people haven't seen yet.  Which she can get pretty pissed off and start swearing and, you know, like, because she's such a lady, you know.  And then all of a sudden it's like, did she just say what I thought she said?  Say it.  Say it.  Say it.  You fucking cunt. 
[03:45:00]  You fucking piece of shit.  What the fuck?  And they would do things like shit in each other's luggage just to piss each other off.  So you look at them and you think, oh, they're pretty normal.  They're not, you know, she's pretty refined and held back.  And then they'll do something like take a dump in each other's luggage.  Rod Stewart.  You know Rod Stewart?  I do.  I met him when I was 17.  Jesus.  What, Rich?  These are the fucking greatest performers of all time. 
[03:45:30]  Yes, they are.  You're like a child.  You're right.  You've got child questions.  I don't care.  Ask a question about Mick Jagger.  Did you really meet Mick?  I know Mick.  Can we call him?  I know Mick.  I lived in England for a long time just off the King's Road on the River Thames in a big 90-foot houseboat.  So we used to hang out.  We used to go to rehearsals.  Ever just live in a house somewhere?  Lita's mom was great friends with Bowie.  That's kind of cool. 
[03:46:00]  Fucking I saw him in concert with Space Oddity.  Oh, what a great fucking concert that was.  You saw the concert.  She knows him.  You're right.  Way to try to relate.  Yeah, well, I know some pretty big fucking celebrities myself.  Who?  Tell them.  Maybe I'm friends with Chris Rock.  I wrote in the Oscars.  Chris Rock, see?  Look at that.  That's good, right?  I'm a fucking celebrity.  I've been on TV over 100 fucking times to 200 to 300 times.  You guys recognize him?  Even with that toe?  100 to 200 to 300.  Yes.  Even with that toe.  Well, I was never on a reality show fucking, you know, sometimes my ad-libs don't work. 
[03:46:30]  But what I'm saying is I'm a big fucking act.  If they had TV, they would know who you are.  They would know who the fuck I am.  You guys, that's true.  Yeah, we don't have TV.  They don't have fucking TV.  How are they going to know?  We don't.  We don't watch TV.  What's the excuse for the rest of us?  They're going to know me now.  They're going to go remember the guy with the fucking nice ass.  All people that don't have sex swings watch TV at night.  Uh-huh.  You know?  Joan Jett.  Don't like her? 
[03:47:00]  Hate her?  I don't have a problem with Joan.  No?  No.  You guys don't really talk anymore, though?  No, I haven't spoken to Joan since the Runaways broke up.  That would be a problem.  I might have said hi to her a couple of times, but that's pretty much it.  When did they break up?  That's pretty much it.  1975.  1980.  Sorry.  1980.  We were together from 1975 to 1980.  Five years.  That's only 29 years.  Why do you think there'd be a problem?  God, you act like it's been a long time or something. 
[03:47:30]  Thank you, Jim.  Yeah, if you haven't talked to someone in 29 years, I would say that might be a little  bit of a problem.  Listener question.  Did Joan Jett ever eat her snatch in the old days?  Did Joan eat her own snatch?  No, yours, I assume.  Uh, no.  All right?  No.  Jesus, Ant.  It's a listener question.  Jim, when you decide to start punching people, remember, I didn't say that.  Look, I am not bisexual.  I'm not homosexual.  I love my husband.  I love penises.  My husband's penis. 
[03:48:00]  And, um...  Homo.  I'm not a fucking homo.  Look at him.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  We're just pointing at you, Rich.  You sucked your fucking drug dealer's dick for more crack.  No, no.  If you just kiss it and it doesn't break your gum line, first of all, okay?  Tell them the story about wearing the shorts.  It's a dumb story.  Is it?  Yeah.  The drug dealer, every time my friends and I would go up to cop from these gay guys, they  would invite one of my two friends up.  Dickie would go, hey, you want to come upstairs to, like, Dirk or Kevin, right?  And, you know, I got to show you something. 
[03:48:30]  Rich got a little jealous.  I got to fucking, you know, I'm going up there for forever and I'm, like, feeling like the  other guy, you know?  You know, he never invited me upstairs to do fucking a lot of free coke, you know?  And he'd go to my friends, can I suck your dick?  And supposedly they said, no, bullshit.  So one time I went up there and I got to, I wanted more free coke.  So I just wore a pair of shorts that were very short.  My basketball shorts.  My short shorts.  And I wore them up there.  Nuts hanging out.  You wore.  Yeah.  You teased.  You wore your Larry Bird shorts. 
[03:49:00]  I wore it on the court one night, too, and the judge goes, you come to my courtroom with  these things on and a skateboard in my hand.  Really?  And he gave me a fucking, he goes, you have to spend four weekends in jail.  And then he fucking dismissed it.  So what about the movie they're making, Lita?  You're not part of it?  I'm in it.  Are you in it?  Or someone's playing you, right?  That's what I heard, yeah.  Well, why are they calling you and getting some, you know, insight? 
[03:49:30]  Because it's a small part and I'm really not interested in being in it.  I'm in it against my will.  Jim, can we talk?  What's the problem with Joan Jett?  No problem with Joan.  There's no problem with Joan.  29 years, Jim.  29 years.  There's no problem.  No problem with Joan.  I'm reading his face right now.  I've got such a readable face.  Yeah, yeah.  Terrible, terrible in poker.  You can read my entire life story.  No problem with Joan Jett.  That's what we're finding out today, yeah. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  No.  No problem.  No.  No problem.  You know, you're in bands with people over the years?  Yeah.  Understand how that is?  I think we're running out of show.  You've had childhood friends, right?  That you haven't talked to in years?  Yeah.  I mean, you didn't necessarily get into a big fight or hate them, did you?  No.  I just kind of move on.  No, I just hate them.  Yeah?  Yeah.  But for no real reason, right?  Yeah.  If you have some time, I'll tell you.  Okay.  Yeah.  You just end up painting people you used to read.  Now's good.  I hate most everybody. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah.  He does.  He hates everybody.  Yeah.  I have my friends now, and everybody else can just, like, fuck off.  Exactly.  Very few, right?  Yeah, very few.  That's right.  And then everybody else.  My circle's done.  I have my circle of friends, done.  I have my kids.  They won't betray me.  Oh, stop.  See, that's how, I mean, honestly.  You think they're your kids.  Yeah.  There's four of us.  You are.  Thank you.  No wonder Joan and Jet, or whatever the fuck her name is, doesn't get along with you.  My kids, both of them, Joan and Jet, and Belinda Carlisle, all of them. 
[03:51:00]  Belinda Carlisle?  Why?  I don't know.  I'm just naming bands from back then.  I don't fucking know.  I'm old.  Go, go.  What was Madonna like?  Was she nice?  Oh, I don't know Madonna.  Actually, I do know Madonna, and from what I've heard, no, she's a bitch.  That's what I've heard, but I don't know for sure.  Don't take that from me.  Her husband, Guy Ritchie, just came out and said some gossipy shit.  I feel sorry for him.  Calling her retarded or something.  Her guy does jiu-jitsu, believe it or not.  Does he?  Yeah.  He looks like a problem. 
[03:51:30]  He's pretty good.  We've had him in.  He looks like he's a problem.  What's your style?  Just kind of punching someone in the face until they fall down?  That used to be.  I'm jiu-jitsu.  Yeah.  And boxing.  Could you show us a move?  Use Rich, maybe?  No.  That's okay.  He won't hurt you.  Seriously, you know, we did that metal show yesterday, and I offered to put one of them  to sleep.  Eddie Chunk and Jim 14.  I offered to put one of them to sleep because they wanted me to pick a guy up.  You play one of Voss's CDs?  I was just going to say that about Jameson, the other guy in the show.  I could put you to sleep, and it wouldn't hurt. 
[03:52:00]  That's okay.  Rich, listen.  It wouldn't hurt.  Rich, I'm 52 years old.  Okay, here's the thing.  You'll start snoring.  My eight-year-old does it.  Yeah, Rich.  Listen, when you guys are on the island putting your family to sleep, fine.  Okay?  All right.  Sorry, if I need to sleep, I'll take a fucking Klonopin or a Xanax.  This is all natural.  A little tiny choke hold on him.  No, this is all natural.  Rich, Rich, is you just tap.  What are you doing, Rich? 
[03:52:30]  This is a great end to our show.  Rich is leaving.  Rich.  He's running away.  What's going to happen?  Don't forget your dildo.  Yeah, don't forget my dildo.  Carry it down in your ass, you fucking pussy.  I'm a pussy.  Yes, you're a pussy.  How about a little choke hold, but we don't knock you out?  I would do it for the host of the show.  They've done it to me.  Why don't you get one of your fucking dumb interns, not a semi-celebrity, who's got fucking  three kids?  Hey, wait a minute.  You're not a semi.  You're a full-on celebrity.  That's what I'm trying to say, Buckus.  It's TV 100 times, for God's sake.  Oh, Rich, do you want to plug? 
[03:53:00]  No, I got enough already.  I'm done with you guys.  Come on, Rich.  He's fleeing the show.  Rich.  First of all, he's really going to give somebody a choke hold wearing a Louis Vuitton bag?  I know.  That won't make him look like a gay basher.  We've talked to him relentlessly about that stupid bag.  Rich, let me see your cat scan.  It's for the show.  Huh?  Let me see your cat scan of your brain.  I don't have time.  I got to...  You want to hear a fun story?  We were...  Uh-oh.  One of the car guys that parked the car, the valet guys, messed up my friend's car. 
[03:53:30]  He hit the door or something.  So you killed him?  No.  That would have been good.  So we went to the valet guy, and he said to talk to the boss.  And then all these valet guys, like, grouped together, right?  And these are the Valentes, the Gracies, and me, right?  And these little fucking valet idiots think they're going to do something.  Somebody tipped him off as to who we were.  Swear to you, in the middle of the parking lot, like, six of these valet guys pulled their 
[03:54:00]  pants down so we won't kill them.  Oh, really?  And it worked.  What is that?  We didn't go near them.  Oh, good.  Pulled their pants down.  That's a good defense.  Yeah, you're not going to kick somebody's ass.  It worked.  Are you serious?  You never told me this.  You were there.  Oh, there's a fight.  You were there.  They're fighting.  Oh, shit.  I was there?  You were there.  I was probably in the bathroom or something.  It was at the Christmas party.  You want to choke out Lita to end the show?  They've tried that.  I choke her out every night.  They've done that.  My kids choke me. 
[03:54:30]  Wait a minute.  I end to being choked a little bit, like, during sex.  No, I don't like that.  That's scary shit, isn't it?  I don't like that.  That's pretty crazy.  Is that what happened to that grasshopper dude?  Yeah, something always happens where somebody, yeah.  Remember?  He's hanging in the closet with fucking nylons on him.  No, no.  I'll bite him or something like that.  You want to bite him now?  We need the big finish.  You bite him or something?  What could you do to a gym or vice versa?  My fucking wife tried to bite me the other night, and I fucking almost knocked her out.  No blood, though.  No blood.  All right.  No.  I don't drop blood.  Where was she biting? 
[03:55:00]  Huh?  Where was she biting?  On my fucking shoulder.  She was nibbling.  I said, if you want to bite, bite my toe where I can't feel it.  Your wife?  Oh, come on.  Let her have a nibble.  Rich, you know I love you.  Rich killed today.  I got to step out of character.  You killed today.  We need a big finish here, Lita.  Lita Ford, and then we get the plugs in.  What could you guys do for her?  What kind of plugs?  I don't know.  We got to make sure people go get Wicked Wondering and a new CD from Lita Ford.  And Jim Gillette is on here as well. 
[03:55:30]  Well, how about we play a song?  That would be a good finish.  We're going to play out with a song.  Okay.  We're definitely going to do that.  Let's do that.  Are you guys doing any shows in town?  We're going to play the fishbowl here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  For real?  Yeah, in an hour or two.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, you're doing that thing.  And he's going to have one on his stomach later.  Four.  I don't know.  You don't get it.  I don't know.  I think a bunch of stations are going to do it.  We're recording it.  That sucks.  Hey, that's cool, man.  Yeah.  You guys are insane.  It's a horrible joke, Rich.  That's horrible.  I would say.  That's awful.
