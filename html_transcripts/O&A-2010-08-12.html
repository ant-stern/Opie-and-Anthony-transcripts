<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts bragging about their show's popularity and outrageousness, followed by a discussion of the large quantity of unsolicited pornographic DVDs they received from adult film companies after a previous segment on porn parodies.  They then reviewed Colin Quinn's one-man show, praising it despite one host's disapproval of Quinn's tea-drinking during the performance.

The show then delved into a graphic discussion of the Discovery Channel's "Monsters Inside Me," focusing on an episode about a man who self-infected with hookworms to treat allergies.  This led to a detailed and explicit discussion of hookworms, their life cycle, and the man's online hookworm sales.  The conversation expanded to other parasites (maggots, tapeworms), fueled by listener calls, including one about a grandmother’s arthritis treatment using bee stings and another describing a video of a massive beehive with bees performing a synchronized warning wave.  Dr. Steve, a recurring guest, provided medical commentary.  The segment concluded with further parasite discussion and a preview of upcoming segments about a JetBlue incident and a song about stopping a mosque.

Next, the hosts reacted with disbelief and vulgar language to a 10-year-old opera singer's performance on *America's Got Talent*.  The conversation abruptly shifted to a JetBlue flight attendant fired for deploying the emergency slide, including a sexually explicit call from someone claiming to be the flight attendant's ex-wife.  This was followed by racially charged commentary about a Harlem shooting and Reverend Al Sharpton’s response, featuring a DJ caller discussing black-on-black crime.  The hosts then discussed a federal housing discrimination lawsuit and a related caller experience, all laced with racial slurs and offensive generalizations.  Finally, they played and criticized a song titled "Stop the Mosque," further discussing the Harlem shooting and Al Sharpton.  The language throughout this segment was consistently vulgar and offensive, including frequent use of racial slurs and sexually explicit content.

A correctional officer then called to discuss security challenges at a prison mosque, prompting absurd solutions from the hosts.  This transitioned into an interview with Ross, a Black Republican, who discussed his political experiences, perceived media bias, and criticism of Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson.  Ross also expressed frustration with the slow rebuilding of the World Trade Center and the mosque controversy.  The hosts then discussed their upcoming guest, Chris Hardwick, expressing reservations about him being a "token" guest.  They touched upon various tangents, including complaining about media treatment of radio personalities and a humorous bit imagining a "Bobby Muslim" character.

The interview with Chris Hardwick covered his large Twitter following, "nerd" culture, his father (a Hall of Fame bowler), anecdotes from his father's career and a Miller High Life commercial, and chess (including a caller's encounter with Bobby Fischer).  The conversation also included his work at MTV and G4, and his opinions on various musicians.  A video of Hardwick's daughter concluded this part of the segment.

The following segment with Chris Hardwick covered *Web Soup*, the difficulties of finding G4 on Time Warner Cable, a local *Gong Show* featuring a bizarre act, sexually suggestive comments about Dakota Fanning, Hardwick's stand-up performances, his G4 and MTV experiences, his recitation of pi,  a caller's mistaken reference to Bobby Fischer as "Eddie Fischer," Victorian-era post-mortem photographs,  a caller's question about Adam Sessler's longevity, various internet videos (including "fastforwardblowjobs.com" and a Donald Duck blowjob audio clip), Hardwick's own viral videos, his friendship with Weird Al Yankovic, other comedians (Stephen Lynch, Brian Regan, John Valby), a "highway comic," and a Darth Schwarzenegger video.

The final segment with Chris Hardwick included jokes about a misidentified video of a governor, a poorly organized person resembling Tony Montana, viral videos, and the difficulties of stand-up comedy.  They mentioned past guests (Bruce Bruce, a ventriloquist hypnotist), and Hardwick promoted his shows at Caroline's.  The conversation was filled with vulgar language and a running joke about a photo on Hardwick's upside-down phone showing his "crack,"  with the hosts reiterating that Hardwick was a "favor" guest.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony are no strangers to scandal.  Opie and Anthony on Satellite Radio.  The host, Anthony Camilla and Greg Opie.  The commercial team.  Opie and Anthony apologizing for yet another crunch.  Common profanity link left.  Is this the last straw for the Washi Radio Zero?  Yay!  Pudding!  The greatest show on Satellite Radio today.  It's entertaining as fuck.  How many people are screaming at their radios right now?  It doesn't get better than this. 
[00:00:30]  It's just the stupidest, most fun.  I can't get enough of this.  I would eat your poo.  You know, let's be honest with each other.  No one's doing better radio than this.  We rule Google it.  You're fucking right.  Simple as that.  Fucking believe it.  This is radio.  Radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning.  Hello.  You going through the DVDs that Steve brought in today?  Yes. 
[00:01:00]  He said that they sent these parodies after we did the piece on Hustle.  I guess Porn Names.  Yeah.  Hustle Video just sent a bunch to us.  Yeah.  They can't be used as giveaways.  And the postal regulations, he's right.  You cannot use these as giveaways.  You can't mail those?  No.  That is how you go to jail.  Oh, really?  Or they try to put you in jail, yeah.  Even just by taking this, right?  And mailing it out?  It could be a problem if that's, if that, quote unquote, the community standards argument,  which is the same one they fuck radio people with. 
[00:01:30]  The community standards argument is how they tried to get Stalliano, I believe.  But it's not any more, like, on the internet now they go after you.  Yeah.  Like, if I can access that in my community, it's all terrible.  It's just, it's sick of me.  What's wrong?  It's just a woman here sucking a big black cock.  Nothing wrong with that.  Everything right about it.  What community doesn't like that?  What's going on with Steve and these DVDs?  I know we've been joking about it, but what the fuck is up? 
[00:02:00]  Is there a kickback, Steve?  Here comes Steve.  What's up with all the DVDs?  The shitty DVDs.  Oh, the shitty ones?  Those are, those are.  No, they're all shitty DVDs.  The shitty DVDs.  Every once in a while you give us one that is kind of cool.  The.  But what's up?  The auto mail lists, they just send you everything.  And a lot of what comes through is just these directed DVD things where you look at them and  you're like, what the hell am I going to do with this?  And sometimes they.  Are you calling these companies asking for shitty DVDs or are they just.  No, I call up the companies and say, listen, we want to do giveaways sometimes. 
[00:02:30]  We want to do.  We want to know about what shows you have coming up.  Just is there a mailing list you can put us on?  And then, boom, it just starts showing up.  And a lot of what shows up is crap.  Right.  And some of what shows up is OK.  And that's what that's what you guys get for giveaways.  And this is just a result of you guys talking about the porn parodies last week.  That was the day you were out.  They were taught.  They did a whole segment on.  Yeah, I figured that out already.  All right.  Who did we did it?  So we got like a dozen fucking parody kind of hustler, I guess, put these out. 
[00:03:00]  Wonderful.  Yeah.  There you go.  Let's divvy them up.  Maybe the three of us can get together and watch one.  On the couch.  Who's bringing the cracker?  I want to put my cracker hat on.  Can I say, by the way, as we started, I saw Colin's show last night.  Oh, you finally did.  Yeah, it was.  Scheduling has not allowed me to.  It was fucking great.  He had a really good crowd for a Wednesday.  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  It was about 90, 95 percent full.  Did the manager give him a smile?  Yeah.  He said, and Colin said, he knows that it's me.  We all spit on him.  But it was so fucking good, man.  I knew it would be funny because he's not going to put out some hack shit.  But it's an hour and 15 minutes of world history.  But it's not only he could make that funny and interesting for an hour.  I couldn't believe it was a fucking hour gone.  It was great, man.  It goes by real fast.  I've yet to see that.  Long story short.  I've got to see it. 
[00:04:00]  You have to, dude.  It's been extended until sometime early September.  Oh, great.  At the Bleecker 45 Theater on Bleecker Street.  It's a fucking amazing space to see a show.  And it's a small theater.  Small theater.  There's like one guy that runs the place.  He rips up your ticket.  He intros the show.  And then he runs to the back to start the light show.  It was so good.  I'm not even joking.  No, you're not.  All of a sudden, the guy panics and starts running.  I'm like, where's he going?  Oh, he has to run the AV equipment at the top of the theater.  Yeah, that's his job, everything. 
[00:04:30]  I would like to see this go, you know, maybe a little uptown or onto HBO for Colin Quinn.  It should do something.  Something's going to happen with it because it's fucking so smart.  And it ties in a lot of history.  It's basically proving that we're the same fucking behemoth we've always been.  And it's tying in a lot of history with who we are now.  And it's flawless.  Really, it flows perfectly.  It's an inarguable logic that he kind of comes at you with.  It's fucking great, man.  I had one critique.  I don't like how he sips his tea in between eras. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's how you know it's time for another era is that the lights go down and Colin takes a sip of tea.  Colin goes to his chair that he doesn't sit down in at all.  And then an antique table and he has a tea.  A little cup of tea.  And he looks at his notes real fast and takes a sip of tea and then turns around and does the next scene.  The tea thing was bother me.  There was a part of me that wanted to spin kick the tea into his teeth.  There's one part where Colin was, he sits in the chair very briefly. 
[00:05:30]  And he sat on the back of it for a second.  I forget what he was talking about.  And he sat on the back and put his feet on the actual cushions.  And the flash in my mind was, oh, God, let him fall back.  Oh, just the thing tips backwards.  I didn't want him to die just to fall back.  Just fall backwards on his skull, on his big Irish head.  But it's really great.  Go online.  It's very easy to get tickets to find.  Just bleaker 45 is one word.  It really is a great show.  Great show. 
[00:06:00]  One man show.  I think it is three a week.  One Wednesday.  And then I want to say two Saturdays.  Friday, I don't be just Friday shows.  Yeah.  So.  I'm glad you saw that finally, Jimmy.  Yeah, I had fun.  You're dropping all the DVDs.  The DVDs are falling all over the floor.  Because Steve.  Ooh.  Because Steve just piles them up.  Here you go.  Jerk off while you're doing the show.  I do.  Oh, my God.  That's record time now. 
[00:06:30]  He deserves to have the best there, Colin.  You know, the guy is just a funny motherfucker any time I've seen him.  And I don't think mainstream media and everything has really picked up on how fucking brilliant the guy is.  I think they know.  But the thing, it's a weird, and again, nobody says it.  Nobody actually, no two guys ever sat down and went, 
[00:07:00]  Man, Colin really attacks a lot of the ideologies that we kind of think are sacred.  Let's not review him.  Or let's ignore him.  Because you can't say he's not funny.  You can't.  Nobody can.  Even scumbag journalists have to have some integrity.  So they just kind of ignore it.  And it's kind of like an unspoken thing.  It's like, because he's just destroying all these little ideological things that they worship.  And he handles Islam really fucking great.  He doesn't attack it in a shitty way.  But he's extremely accurate and funny about it. 
[00:07:30]  And it's like, that's the way you should talk about Islam.  He's very balanced as far as beating everybody up.  So it's a perfect project for him.  He doesn't allow it.  This is why Colin's great, because his anger, he doesn't allow his anger to block what he's doing.  Like, it'll come in.  But he doesn't allow it to wreck or taint the fucking bit he's doing.  He still gives you a fucking, a full picture of something.  And even though I know personally how he feels about it, it's just a great thing as a performer.  I can't do that.  I get too angry. 
[00:08:00]  That's my idea of a great joke.  What the fuck?  And I fall apart.  You punctuate with, what the fuck?  Yeah, it's childish, dude.  It's like, you know, that's what you want to do.  Someone's going to be called a whore?  Yeah, it's silly.  What are you going to do?  But there's not one comic that would watch that and not just be blown away.  But not one fucking working comic would watch that and not go, fuck.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's going to get bigger and better, too.  Yeah, absolutely.  I see that ending up on HBO or Showtime or something for him.  If it doesn't, there's so many one-man shows that are filmed. 
[00:08:30]  And look, Legu Zama's a funny guy, and they film a lot of one-man shows.  If somebody doesn't shoot this and show it, it's clean enough for fucking almost any network.  I mean, NBC, maybe not, but any cable network, especially HBO, it's not filthy.  It's not even dirty.  No, it's very clever.  Yeah.  Very clever.  There's something very wrong if this doesn't go somewhere.  Enough of kissing that jackass's ass.  Oh, believe me.  My goal is to get it or to find out that it's been picked up by HBO or Showtime, 
[00:09:00]  and then he's on his way to tape and a fucking dump truck runs him over.  That's what I'm rooting for.  I hope they tell him he can't have his tea.  Yeah.  And that's his crutch, and he can't do the show without his tea.  Samson's hair, his tea.  We're opening night.  He's doing it, and the first couple jokes are destroying, and he takes a sip,  and the tea bag goes down his throat, and he chokes, and they have to stop production.  Ah, poor Colin. 
[00:09:30]  Enough about the tea.  Oh, he loves that goddamn tea.  It's always sunny in Philadelphia.  The season premiere, I got that in front of me, too, for Steve.  Oh, yes.  Great, thanks.  Wonderful.  It's always coming in Philadelphia.  That's the parody.  I'll be right back.  I'm going to Philadelphia.  I'll play sunny.  You be Phil, and you be Delphia.  No, it's really good. 
[00:10:00]  Any GoFundMe is fantastic.  I have another Discovery Channel DVD.  Would you like it?  The premiere is two weeks ago.  Season one.  Yeah, the show's been over for five years.  Oh.  I was watching that goddamn, and I hate these shows, but I couldn't stop the monster inside  us thing. 
[00:10:30]  You know, we've been talking about that.  I thought you said you wouldn't watch that show.  I wouldn't, but I got stuck watching it.  I was all, like, frightened.  The monster within or the monster inside?  Inside us.  It's all about bacterias and fucking parasites that get into your body and fuck you up.  And they do, like, this whole CGI microscopic thing and show what the bugs are doing inside  you and shit.  Oh, my God.  And no matter what they're talking about, I feel like, oh, my, I could get that.  I don't want to get that.  That's some girl, and she's walking around, and she gets, like, a little bite on the bottom 
[00:11:00]  of her foot.  And I'm like, I've gotten that.  Everyone's gotten that.  And it's itching one day, and it's like, yeah.  And it itches.  And then it starts going away, and then it comes back worse.  And worse.  And then a couple weeks later, she looked at it, and it was like this bubble on the  bottom of her foot, and something inside was moving.  Holy shit.  No.  What was that?  I was freaking out.  It was fly larvae again.  Fly larvae.  Them fucking flies are laying their maggots everywhere. 
[00:11:30]  Then why don't we fucking kill all the flies?  I wish we could.  Let's exterminate them.  You got to watch out for those.  And then some other nutty guy.  This one, it didn't even seem like it belonged in this show, but he's gardening or landscaping  with his brother, and they're cutting down these big bushes, and a bunch of bees come  out and sting the fuck out of this guy.  Okay.  So I'm like, what the fuck is this?  It's a parasite show, and it's talking about bee stings and shit.  So the guy starts going into this allergic reaction. 
[00:12:00]  He can't breathe.  They take him to the hospital.  I guess they give him epi, and then he's fine.  But they realize he's allergic to everything.  This guy's allergic to fucking grass, pollen, all kinds of shit.  But he needs inhalers and all this.  Sprays and all that.  He's constantly fucked up.  They put him on these drugs that make him fucking fat, big and fat and fucked up, and his  health just starts deteriorating because he's got these allergies.  Then he reads that if you get infected by the hookworm, it'll take away your allergies. 
[00:12:30]  There's something that it does where if the hookworm, which it does is, it burrows.  They're always burrowing, by the way.  I know.  The fucking parasites, they're always burrowing.  And they burrow into your intestines, and then they grab on and suck off the blood in  there, and then your body sends all kinds of defense mechanisms to the site of these 
[00:13:00]  hookworms.  And somehow, I don't know how, they didn't explain it, that fucking is supposed to take  care of your allergies.  Does it take care of, let me ask you, Ed.  Does it take, sending blood, does it take care of the allergy, or is the fucking, the  blood that would probably be used to swell the tissue in your nose, now being used to  fucking fight a worm?  A hookworm.  Yeah, that could be because the allergies themselves...  You've got to keep the hookworm in you?  Yes.  So you can't remove the hookworm?  Oh, wait for this. 
[00:13:30]  The allergies themselves are your body reacting to something that's relatively harmless in a  way that your body thinks it's harmful.  So pollen, which gets in your nose, does a little irritating.  Some people just be like an itchy nose, other people gets all inflamed because your body's  just sending all kinds of defense mechanisms up there.  So this guy hears about the hookworm, but now your hookworm, you know how you get a hookworm?  Oh, God.  This is disgusting.  I know, we're just watching this.  Here's how you get a hookworm. 
[00:14:00]  You've got to walk somewhere where there's hookworms.  And what they do is they burrow into the bottom of your feet.  All right, but where are the hookworms?  Africa.  Africa, again.  In a village where the people shit.  So this guy flies to fucking Africa from the United States and just starts trotting  in these nasty fucking African villages where all the residents are shitting and just trotting  in their shit. 
[00:14:30]  His allergies were so bad?  Yeah.  So he wants to get the hookworm in his foot?  Yeah.  So he and there was no way to tell.  Can't they just implant the hookworm in him?  No ethical doctor is going to do that.  Why?  If it takes away your allergies?  Because it was an experimental thing that his auntie in England heard about.  Okay.  So no ethical doctor is going to do this.  He can't find one.  So he just...  Look at the hookworm.  They're disgusting monsters.  So the first day that there's really a lot of pollen in the air, and he's thinking, I'm 
[00:15:00]  going to get this allergic reaction.  So he realizes nothing's happening.  No allergies.  So he freaks out.  It's like, this is great.  This is great.  He goes to the doctor.  The doctor does confirm that he does indeed have a hookworm.  So he did the right thing by...  He said it worked.  ...by marching around in everyone's shit.  Yeah.  ...by marching in people's, Africans' shit.  To get the hookworm in his foot.  To get the hookworm.  And now you know what he does?  I know the end of the story, and I didn't even watch the show.  What?  What else did he get from fucking stomping in the shit? 
[00:15:30]  But it seems he didn't get anything.  Oh, okay.  But here's what he does now.  People with allergies, he's online now selling.  He harvests the hookworms from himself and sells them on the internet to people with allergies.  How does he harvest them?  In his shit?  I guess out of his shit.  Wait, is the thing laying eggs in him?  Yeah.  How many hookworms does he have?  I don't know.  How come the hookworm can't just hang out by itself?  They've got a bunch of hookworms.  Parasites don't like hanging out by themselves.  And eventually the hookworms are going to completely take over this guy's body, no? 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, he said he's got to watch his health because of hookworms.  Because a lot of weight loss, and you'll get other, prone to infections and stuff.  This is horse shit.  What show was this on?  This is on the fucking Monsters.  It was on the Monsters show.  Monsters.  Monsters Within or whatever.  Within us.  Within us.  Monsters Inside Me.  I don't know what it is.  Monsters Inside Me.  What gets rid of a hookworm?  It looks like the back of that videotape I was just watching with the black guy.  Monsters Inside Us. 
[00:16:30]  The cock is huge.  So wait.  The guy gets one hookworm, and then they multiply in his body?  Yeah.  And he has no problem with this?  That the hookworms or the population is getting larger and larger inside him?  He said the allergies and the reaction to the medicines he was taking to keep the allergies  even in check were so bad that he was swelled up like the steroids made his head real fat, and he just got these infections on himself, and he was all fucked up.  Oh, he's on that fathead steroid.  Yeah, yeah, something like that. 
[00:17:00]  The Jerry Lewis steroid.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It starts with a P, right?  Prefacet?  Prefacet, right?  Something like that.  Something like that.  Prefacet or something, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He grabbed that.  I call it the fathead steroid.  Fathead.  The lunkheads.  Yeah, it cures everything, but now you've got a fathead.  But the thing with the hookworm is interesting, because allergies are torture.  When you can't sleep, dude, it's a nightmare.  That's me.  A nightmare.  But I'm not to the stage where I'm going to go marching around and shit in Africa and get a hookworm, but that's me. 
[00:17:30]  I'm allergic to all trees and all grass.  That's why I come in here with these low-level sicknesses all the fucking time.  But how do they get rid of it?  Like, say he wanted to get rid of the hookworm.  What's the process to get rid of it?  There's got to be something you could take in modern medicine to go to the hookworm.  I'm sure there is, but they didn't go into that either.  Where are the hookworms hanging out in his body?  In his intestines.  How does he harvest them?  Wait, how does it start in the bottom of his foot and get into his intestine?  They know where to go.  They go all the way up.  Get the fuck out of here.  They get in your bloodstream first, and they travel around, and they know where the intestines are.  And once the bloodstream reaches to nourish the intestines, they pop out and fucking burrow into your intestinal wall. 
[00:18:00]  And like you said, he's harvesting hookworms for other people that are suffering like him.  Is this the website?  Yeah, he's selling it on the internet.  How to purchase a hookworm?  Is that it?  That's his site?  Can we pet?  What a goal.  Dude, weight loss and fucking the allergies are gone?  Get me one of these.  I'm going to raise a bunch of them and pet them as pets.  I was going to say, we should purchase one and just make them a pet.  They rule.  Can we have a hookworm pet? 
[00:18:30]  You don't need it.  Look at it under a microscope every morning.  See how the little fella's doing.  Frightened of the hookworm.  Yeah, a hookworm doesn't seem pleasant.  Look at his face.  He's like, ah!  He's got big teeth.  He just burrows into you.  Prevacet is for heartburn.  Thank you, Vincent.  Oh, whatever.  Yeah, I knew that was wrong.  Pregnizone?  Pregnizone.  Something like that?  Yeah, some shit.  Yeah, okay.  That's the fathead star, right?  Lunkhead.  Lunkhead.  Oh, Jordy Verrill, you lunkhead.  But it's amazing.  It stops the fucking...  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:19:00]  It stops the allergies.  That's the thing.  Yeah, but I want to know what the hookworm does to you.  Obviously, you're losing weight, but what else?  Are you getting liquid shits every morning?  Yeah, got to be a hook to it.  If it's hanging out in your stomach, you know that's making your digestive tract a complete nightmare.  It's in your intestines, so it can give you all kinds of colitis and all kinds of abdominal pains.  How about you just deal with sneezing every day?  Walk around with some fucking tissues.  But he had the lunkhead, too.  He wanted to get rid of the lunkhead.  Oh, the fathead? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He had to get rid of that.  How about you get rid of your pollen comforter?  That's the problem with him.  He sleeps on pollen.  Would you buy a pollen comforter?  Yeah, he lives under a fucking tree in a hammock between two pollen-making trees.  What a dummy.  With his giant head.  You know, Ant, you started something now.  Oh, it's terrible.  Mike in Pennsylvania, we all, well, used to have, in my case, a grandmother that did some wacky things for T.O.R.S.  Mike, what do you got? 
[00:20:00]  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  You jogged a memory on me there with the whole bee sting thing.  My grandmother suffered from really bad arthritis when I was a young boy.  And she used to go to a beehive and let the bees sting her repeatedly.  And she said it took away the arthritis pain for some months.  Yeah, it does.  No, it doesn't.  You're hurting for the fucking bee stings.  You don't know you have arthritis anymore.  You're too busy running away yelling, get off me.  Right. 
[00:20:30]  Wait.  That's all I've got, boys.  Thank you.  No, dude, she would actually just go to the hive herself, because there's doctors that do this.  Yeah, he just left.  Did he hang up?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Dummy.  I can't believe that the old lady would go to the hive, because there's a doctor that  will do it.  I've seen this.  They take the whole day.  They had a hole to be with tweezers, and they just put it on your arm, and the bee stings  you.  It's a honeybee.  And the bee injects some of the venom or whatever it is that actually helps with arthritis.  But this old lady would just go to the fucking hive?  That seems a little dangerous.  Because it's an old lady.  Dude, but that's how all that stuff started. 
[00:21:00]  And then a doctor goes, all right, we can control this instead of having you put your whole  arm in a beehive.  Can this guy call back?  I would love to know that his grandmother would just go to a hive and stick a fucking  arm in it.  That's what he said.  People are using leeches now.  It's like leeches have made a big comeback with bleeding people and maggots with cleaning  wounds.  I heard they were talking about it on the show last night, maggot therapy.  And all I thought was this giant maggot sitting there with a notebook asking you about your  child.  Don't laugh. 
[00:21:30]  You don't have to.  It was an image I got in my head that made me smile.  So fuck everybody.  It is kind of funny.  It's maggot therapy.  It's maggot therapy.  It wasn't meant to be funny.  It was poignant.  Well, that's what your therapist calls it when he doesn't want you to have self-esteem.  Welcome to maggot therapy.  Thank you, doctor.  Hello, maggot.  That's what happens when you're in the Marine Corps.  What?  Is that a hook warm?  No, those are maggots on people's massive infections.  Have you ever seen people alive with, I've seen on, you go to blood shows, there's maggots 
[00:22:00]  in people's heads and feet and arms while they're alive.  There's some homeless guys we've had through here.  We've seen some maggots.  Goddamn flies.  We've seen maggots on homeless guys.  Just lay their eggs everywhere.  They're terrible, but you know what?  Maggots eat the fucking, the dead.  Maggots are actually helpful for a load.  Yeah, they eat the dead fucking.  Oh, really?  Yes, they are.  They eat the infected tissue.  Oh, do they love rotting meat?  Love it!  They don't want the healthy stuff.  No!  Can't get enough of it, right?  Nerds to it, they say.  Nerds.  They like to fucking rot.  If you have a wound and you're in the jungle, which I am all the time. 
[00:22:30]  Yes.  I'm in the jungle, baby.  The jungle.  So I find some maggots and put them in my wound.  Hey, clean this, maggot.  Clean it up, maggot.  Here's Beasting Guy calling back.  Okay.  All right, Mikey.  Yes, sir?  Uh, Jimmy wanted you to call back.  Yeah, Mike, that was interesting because I've seen the doctors do it in shows, but how did  your grandmother, A, learn about it, and B, how would she get her fucking stung in the  right place?  Well, see, Mike, my grandfather had honeybees.  Oh.  And actually in hives, and she would go out with a smoker, and she would smoke the bees out 
[00:23:00]  of the hives, and she would actually just let them land on her.  Smokers!  Sorry.  What a world.  I mean, it's, you know, it sounds primitive, but it works for her, you know?  Where would they land?  On her arms and legs?  Where was her arthritis?  On her arms.  Wow.  She would let them finger on her arms and her hands.  On her hood.  That hood.  See, now I get, like, the heebie-jeebies and get itchy.  Well, you started that shit.  No, 10 to 15 things, man, and she'd brush them off, and she'd go through the whole itching 
[00:23:30]  process for about three or four hours, and six months later, she'd do it again.  Every, it would last that long?  Yeah, absolutely.  Wow.  I was hoping she would have to do it every few hours.  Yeah.  Bees are like a ride already with her.  Yeah.  Every 13 minutes.  Wow.  Okay.  Yeah, every six months.  All right.  Thanks, man.  That's interesting to me.  Yeah.  Oh.  Take care.  I saw some show on bees, by the way, on a guy who is fucking David Attenborough.  You know who he is?  Oh, yeah.  He gets raised up somewhere in Africa or the Amazon. 
[00:24:00]  These bees are so many of them, they can't find a big hive, so they nest outdoors.  Their whole hive is outdoors.  It's a living colony.  Alfresco.  Is that what it's called?  Yes.  That's when they're outdoors.  Dining.  Dining alfresco.  They're nesting alfresco.  Yes, they are.  It's because some of the bees are smokers.  And they go way up on a giant Amazon tree.  And see if you can find fucking David Attenborough, just to see the image of it.  And it's a giant clump of living bees hanging under a branch, and he goes up on a tree branch 
[00:24:30]  next to it.  No, dummy.  He's wearing a bee suit.  Oh, I'm itching.  Amazing how what he just says, their defense, is if you put your hand by it, they don't  just sting you.  The whole thing just kind of moves in a wave to warn you to get the fuck away.  No.  I don't know why.  That's nothing to do with the hookworms.  They do a little wave?  They do, yeah.  See if you can find David Attenborough.  Wow.  It doesn't matter.  I don't want to divert.  These are very scary to me.  Bees?  Yeah.  Bees, yeah.  Big fan of the bee. 
[00:25:00]  I want to know more about hookworms.  Although I'm freaking out now about flies.  Why?  Because in the past fucking two weeks, we've been talking about flies laying there, fucking  eggs everywhere in your head, your feet.  And Spectro from Michigan goes, on what planet do flies bite?  Where the fuck do you live?  Flies bite you all the time.  Those big fucking green ones?  The big greeny, nasty flies.  We've got nasty green flies on Long Island that'll bite the shit out of you.  I remember going to the beach and you'd get bitten by them all the time.  We're not talking about those dumb house flies. 
[00:25:30]  Maybe they bite, but you never feel it.  We're talking about these awful green ones.  I don't know what they're called.  Are they blow flies?  Huh?  Are they blow flies?  Yeah, flies bite and they fucking itch and will make you itch like a motherfucker.  Horse flies.  Is that horse flies?  They're huge.  Yeah, but this Spectro doesn't realize that flies bite.  Of course they do.  That's a hive?  Yeah.  Holy shit, that's a lot of bees.  Wow.  That's a living hive.  Oh, I'm itchy.  It's an out...  They live outdoors. 
[00:26:00]  Wow.  It's a massive fucking hive.  They all just hang from a branch.  I'm such a faggot.  They're giant honeybees.  But what if you want to just fly away, but you're holding up everybody else?  Yeah.  Look at this lunatic.  That isn't even a good bee suit.  Look, they could get right up under your neck.  No.  A bee suit sucks because they...  No, he zips it up.  See?  But bees always get in them.  Yeah, they do.  But that's only if you're going to go in there and put...  He's not going to nuzzle them with his face.  I don't even want to be ten miles near these motherfuckers.  It's frightening. 
[00:26:30]  It really is horrifying how bees...  If you're around...  Guys who aren't afraid of bees...  Oh, he's getting raised up this tree next to this giant outdoor hive.  It's just a clump of bees.  That's a big-ass tree.  Oh, dude.  It's massive.  It's a wall of bees just hanging off this branch.  It looks like an old lady's underarm.  Yeah, yeah.  Hanging.  Like a fat woman's skin hanging.  Would you punch that?  Oh, God.  I was just thinking the same thing.  How great it would be.  Yeah, just punch it once. 
[00:27:00]  Punch the stupid bees.  Yes.  He's saying it's better to warn them.  With some dramatic displays.  I've got a...  A stick?  A stick with a fake hornet on it.  Oh, cool.  Let's see if I can get them to do it.  Just watch.  There.  Oh, man!  There's a moving wave which passes over the surface of the...  They all, like, raise their wings.  Almost like a wave in a stadium.  That's fucking crazy.  They're doing a stadium wave.  But it also makes it very difficult for any... 
[00:27:30]  Look how synchronized they are.  ...a hornet, which eats bees, to actually land on that moving carpet of wings.  Dude, how do they get that organized?  Bees are fucking amazing.  It's a perfect line moving down this conglomeration of fucking bees.  Yeah, they all do the wave like in a stadium to warn off whatever it is.  Right.  Until the moth fucking comes along. 
[00:28:00]  There's just so much we don't know.  Dude, insects just give me the creeps.  I don't know how they hang out with each other.  Like, I always wonder, like, how would it...  If I was a bee, I would hate to crawl under the bees.  It would give me the creeps.  Yeah, they're crawling all over each other.  Like, but not just these on the outside.  There's ones way down at the bottom.  Because there's honeycombs.  There is honeycombs.  The combs in which they store it are continuously guarded by the covering of bees.  Just forward a little bit just because there's a moth that shows up to steal a little honey.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  A moth wants a little honey.  Yeah.  Hello, I'm a moth.  Death's head pork moth. 
[00:28:30]  Oh.  It's at night.  And they're warning it off.  It goes so close to it that the bees are alarmed enough to waive their warning.  And he's flying above them.  Wow.  Death's head moth.  Isn't that the one that's in the throat?  Silence of the lambs.  It wants honey.  But look what he does.  He's looking for a place to land.  What is he, stupid?  Doesn't he know those are bees?  Amazingly, it manages to land on the carpet of bees and quickly pushes its way to... 
[00:29:00]  Holy shit!  It just went right into the big pile of bees!  He went into the pile of bees.  Is it going to come out?  And it's off.  Yep.  Wow.  He does...  The moth does something which makes the bees...  It's a scent where they think it's him.  Where they think it's them.  It's fucking amazing.  That's stupid.  Bees, what a bunch of...  I don't realize, hey, this thing's giant with faggot wings.  They could do all these amazing things and yet they can't fucking identify...  They can't figure out a moth.  Yeah.  The moth gets through.  I love how they give me a knife and fork with a sandwich. 
[00:29:30]  That nature is a fucking weird thing, man.  It just is insanity.  Yeah.  But I'm sorry.  The hookworms were...  No, man.  That bee thing is very interesting.  I'm going to have to watch some of those videos later today.  Tablespoon of honey gets rid of honey.  What?  What?  Tablespoon of honey gets rid of honey.  Analogies go away.  Tablespoon of honey and allergies?  I wish Dr. Steve was here.  Believe me, I've never said that before, nor will I again. 
[00:30:00]  But he would know what...  I would love to know what the hookworm does which causes your allergies.  Let's wake that fucker up, man.  Well, the...  I think you're right, though.  It takes your resources that would normally be used to fight these harmless allergies  and brings them to the hookworm to fight them  and kind of doesn't leave...  Maybe it deflects your defenses from going to the allergy part.  Right.  I don't know.  It's too busy just speculating. 
[00:30:30]  I'm fighting off the infection of the hookworm.  Yeah, cut off a limb.  That also works, yeah.  Right, you hookworm infection.  Yeah.  It keeps getting worse.  Your body has bigger problems.  That's what it comes down to.  You finally end up just having to inject AIDS in you to kill everything else.  Exactly.  Adam in Jersey, Adam.  Yaw.  Yaw.  Go ahead, Adam.  Hey, I was wondering, can those bees form into like a hammer and hit the guy?  I've seen that on many cartoons, sir.  The hammer isn't what you've got to worry about.  It's when they make a bow and arrow out of themselves and then fling the bee arrow at you 
[00:31:00]  and then it goes, when it hits you in the buttocks as you run away repeatedly.  I like that.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, a little cartoon logic.  Never hurt anyone, right?  Yes.  This guy's had every kind of worm in his body.  What the fuck's wrong with you, Trev?  What's wrong?  Where have you been?  Trev.  Asian lady.  You're on.  Hey, guys.  Well, I'm South African by birth.  See, of course.  That means you're dirty by nature.  And by the way, that's where the little girl was that got the fucking fly in her foot was 
[00:31:30]  South Africa.  And then they're wondering, oh, what could have happened?  What girl was flying her foot?  Ah, the one that got the maggot in her foot that was crawling around because she was vacationing  in South Africa.  What are you vacationing on a continent that's a Petri dish?  Yeah, it's all kinds of crap.  But I used to get roundworm, hookworm, tapeworm, you name it.  And my mom would disinfect all of us kids at least once a month. 
[00:32:00]  You can either take a single-dose pill or you can take a course of seven days.  If you take the one-dose pill, then three weeks later, you have to take another one.  And they taste like absolute crap.  I remember as a kid.  How about you just swallow them so you don't taste them?  Yeah, you've got to chew them.  You can't just swallow them.  You've got to chew them.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, they're disgusting.  But I'll tell you what the worms do to you when they're in your intestine, why you lose  weight.  They feed off your glucose.  That's the whole point.  And your glucose is your blood sugar. 
[00:32:30]  The more blood sugar you have, the more prone you are to put on weight.  It transforms to fat.  The less glucose you have, the less fat you're going to retain.  But, of course, your muscles also suffer.  The most dangerous of all of them is roundworm.  Roundworm, it doesn't make a distinction between sitting in your intestine.  It'll even camp on your brain and kill you.  I don't want that.  How do you get rid of these things?  Well, like I say, here in the United States, worms in humans aren't very common at all. 
[00:33:00]  Of course not.  We rule.  No argument there.  Whereas in South Africa, as I say, there's an actual over-the-counter drug you get, either  a seven-day course or a single-day course.  And within about six days, you start looking for the worms as they're coming out your ass.  Some of them are dead.  Some of them are alive.  Oh, but the pills, there are the pills.  Do you know what the pills do to get rid of them?  How do they dislodge them?  Well, what it does is it blocks the worms' ability to synthesize the glucose. 
[00:33:30]  And so because they aren't getting any nutrition anymore, they just unlatch themselves.  Wow.  Who figured that out?  I know.  Isn't that amazing?  Well, yeah.  I guess probably some American went over to South Africa and got sick and tired of worms  and came up with the idea.  Yes, it probably wasn't American.  Hey, is there any kind of home remedy for that stuff?  What did they do 500 years ago or 100 years ago? 
[00:34:00]  Is that all they could do?  Is there any way to combat that that was natural?  Well, I know that some of the home remedies, you know, include cod liver oil with vinegar  and, you know, there's a whole bunch of things.  I know in Africa a good home remedy is it grows on a coral tree.  It's a bean and too much of it will kill you.  So you've got to be real careful.  You can take a quarter of the bean and swallow that and it works pretty good.  Oh, wow.  But most people don't touch it only because from bean to bean the toxicity level, you 
[00:34:30]  know, varies so much.  Wow.  I loved you in District 9, by the way.  The prawn, the prawn, that's his scrawl.  That is his scrawl that he gave.  He just gave that.  It's Mr. Sweetie, man.  South Africans.  You all sound English.  All right, Trev.  Thanks, man.  We've got Dr. Steve on the phone.  Dr. Steve, we're talking about hookworms, maggots.  Home remedies, bee stings for arthritis. 
[00:35:00]  We are.  And we woke you up, so you better be good.  Oh, God.  We woke you up, so you better be good.  That's right.  How does that work?  The hookworm.  In our world, that's what works.  What it is is photosynthesis.  I am.  If you take the glucose and the glutamine.  Glucose.  Did I say that wrong?  Glucose, he said.  Well, glue does make things close.  It does. 
[00:35:30]  See, the hookworms that help your allergies not affect you anymore.  Say that again?  Hookworms.  Oh, shit.  He's real sleepy.  Answer on special on hookworm.  If people get certain high on hookworms, their allergies don't affect them anymore.  Wow.  Now, that's a new one on me.  But I can imagine why you develop antibodies to the hookworms.  To the y'all.  Yeah.  And those particular antibodies may block the antibodies for your allergies. 
[00:36:00]  Oh.  That would just be a theory.  I don't know that that's the case.  But that would be something.  It would have to be something like that.  Yeah, I just saw that one.  Like I was talking about with those Ascaris that we showed you the pictures of last time  I was on.  Those Ascaris Lumbricoides.  And those are the ones that were coming out of the kid's nose and mouth.  And then the shot where the kid was shitting this giant mass of worms out of his ass. 
[00:36:30]  Spaghetti, yeah.  Ew, where's that?  Oh, it's disgusting.  If Kim was there, actually show that to him, Danny.  If Danny's there, it's Ascaris.  Danny just said, no, I don't want to.  You might want to finish your breakfast, too.  It is so fucking disgusting.  A-S-C-A-R-I-S.  A-S-C-R-I-S?  A-S-C-A-R-I-S.  And then just click on Google Image and it'll be the second picture that comes up.  Someone having duty worms on?  Duty worms. 
[00:37:00]  I think this was the picture I tweeted last week and they yanked it, man.  Oh, God.  They wouldn't allow this on fucking Twitter.  Now, where's the one where the spaghetti's coming out of the guy's ass?  Yeah, yeah.  That's it.  That's Ascaris.  Ascaris.  Yeah, we can't find it now.  Maybe Google Image got rid of it.  I mean, we got the images of the worms, but we can't see the one.  Oh, there it is.  Bottom right.  Bottom right.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I tweeted this last week and they yanked it.  Ew.  It's a medical picture.  Shitting ramen noodles.  Yeah, that's a bunch of worms coming out of one person? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And what I'm thinking on that picture is that's, remember when the guy that you were talking  to before talked about taking the pill and then you start shitting out the worms?  I think those are probably dead worms that this guy is shitting out after taking.  I bet you he felt much better, though, after that shit.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good dump right there.  Oh, my God.  I would hate that.  I feel a lot thinner and less bloated. 
[00:38:00]  But wait, so that guy shit the what kind of what the ascaris worms?  Yeah, those are round worms.  And those are the ones that he was talking about.  Have no respect for where they live.  Because if you look around, you'll see other pictures of round worms coming out of or other  orifers.  Yeah, nose and mouth.  They'll come out of your nose at night.  They'll come out of your mouth.  They're really disgusting.  I really don't like this at all.  So how do you get rid of them?  Same thing.  You take a dose of medication.  And they shit them out. 
[00:38:30]  All right.  So you don't know about the hookworm.  So how about home remedies, like the bee sting for arthritis?  Okay.  There are some people out there that believe that bee stings are good for rheumatoid arthritis.  And they have some effect on osteoarthritis, too.  And I've never seen a good study that says the bee sting venom is for real.  Now, if I get on PubMed real quick and look at bee sting venom, there will be a bunch of 
[00:39:00]  studies there.  And I don't think any of them are conclusive.  Hang on just a second.  Let me just do that.  Oh, look at you.  A little research going down.  This is good.  Now, what there are studies of is bee stings causing neuropathic pain, which is nerve damage  pain.  But as far as it being a treatment for anything, there really aren't good studies out there 
[00:39:30]  that I'm aware of and I'm scrolling through here right now.  Here's one.  Bee toxin takes the sting out of cancer, but it's a letter to the editor and not an actual  study.  Oh, okay.  So it's one guy that did it and said, wow, it worked.  And who knows?  Yeah.  And so there's just not a lot out there for that.  But I think that one's a myth so far.  Although, you know, it's interesting that a lot of the treatments that we get for things 
[00:40:00]  come from natural substances that otherwise can be harmful to you.  Yeah.  Fox glove is a somewhat toxic plant that when you extract it, you get a drug called digitalis  that we use all the time in people with heart failure.  And, you know, botulism toxin is the most toxic substance on earth, milligram per milligram.  And, you know, I just injected some in some lady's face last night for, you know... 
[00:40:30]  All right.  That's hot.  Yeah.  I'm going to inject this in your face.  I injected some protein.  Well, there are some...  You know, there is a history of looking at toxic things and seeing if they'll...  If they're therapeutic at all.  But I'm just not aware of anything.  Yeah.  Dr. Steve, the colon is like a river that has ebbs and eddies and...  I know how much you love Michio Kahn. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, I love him too, man.  I do love him.  He rules.  We got somebody on the line with you, Dr. Steve.  Johnny in Minnesota.  Johnny.  Johnny.  You're on with the great Dr. Steve, Weird Medicine.  Well, good morning, boys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hi.  Hello.  I have these dumb Polak friends of mine.  They went up to Canada and they tried to make, you know, that sabich where you cure the fish  with a lemon instead of coconut.  Well, anyway.  I get that.  We're moving right along here. 
[00:41:30]  No old cuisine.  So what ends up, this guy gets back and he's having really trouble in his gut.  So he goes to take a shit and there's something dangling out of there.  So he reaches down and pulls it.  You know when you go to grab a nightcrawler and the other half snaps back?  Yeah.  It snaps back in his asshole.  Oh.  He goes to the doctor and if I'm lying, I'm dying.  This guy shit 18 feet of fucking tapeworm.  Wow.  18 feet of tapeworm?  Is that how... 
[00:42:00]  18 fucking feet.  Is that one tapeworm or just a bundle of them?  It was one fucking worm.  Is that possible, Dr. Steve?  Well, and he got this from an uncooked fish.  Is that what...  Uncooked walleye, which is a freshwater fish.  Yeah.  I've never heard of getting tapeworms from walleye.  But I wouldn't say it's impossible.  Usually you get tapeworm infection by eating food that someone else has shit on. 
[00:42:30]  Well, these are polawks.  These are polawks, too.  You never know.  Polawks?  What year is this?  Maybe he thought it was from that and it was from something else.  Maybe he actually didn't realize how he got it.  Maybe he thought he got it from the fish.  That tapeworm is 20 feet long.  25.  Well, it was a keeper.  Yeah.  So wait, hold on.  The tapeworm that's 18...  What is the tapeworm attached to?  Your intestines?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It sits in your intestine and just feeds off the things that you're eating. 
[00:43:00]  And people, in the old days, women would take tapeworm eggs to lose weight.  All right.  Good for them.  That's wonderful.  Right.  That's a go-getter.  Why don't you just eat something that the tapeworm doesn't like?  I don't think there is any such thing.  It's like everything.  It just likes shit.  Does it like broccoli?  It's like shit.  Wait.  Tapeworm eggs to lose weight?  Yeah, man.  How do you get rid of the tapeworm, then?  Well, you have to...  Back then, I'm not sure they knew exactly how to get rid of it. 
[00:43:30]  I mean, people do all kinds of stupid things to lose weight.  Especially back then.  Yeah.  They almost had to poison this guy to get the thing out of them.  Yeah.  That's wonderful.  All right.  Yeah, and then the tapeworm.  Get Danny to Google tapeworm, because they're really lovely.  Danny's just shaking his head.  Google tapeworm, Danny.  We've got a bunch of hard dicks in this room, Dr. Steve.  What's wrong with everybody, man?  Would you say we're looking at the blue waffle?  We can handle looking at a fucking tapeworm today.  While he's doing that, I did some research at the National Library of Medicine, and there 
[00:44:00]  was a study done on hookworm infection for asthma.  Oh.  There were some epidemiologic studies, and those are studies where they just sort of look back  in time, and they correlate one thing against another, and they suggested that hookworm infection  protected against asthma, which is an allergy state.  And so they went ahead and did a study where they infected people with hookworms, and they 
[00:44:30]  found when they did it prospectively, in other words, you take a bunch of people, you give  them the infection, and then you look and see if it protects against asthma.  It did not show any effect whatsoever.  Don't go infecting yourself with hookworms, because it doesn't protect you against asthma.  Right.  Especially when someone tells you you've got hookworms, and you're like, you can't breathe.  Wait, can we see a video of tapeworm, Danny?  We were looking at this image.  This video, this still picture's bad enough.  No, it's not.  It's like a giant shoestring. 
[00:45:00]  It looks cute.  I want to pick it up and hold it.  It looks like a stole.  It looks harmless.  Shook-a-shook-a, a tapeworm.  Yes, you can.  You grab the one, the middle, and you hold it, when his little mouth opens to grab and  test it, you go, come here, shook-a-shook-a, under his little chin.  It's got one long chin.  Doesn't it have a chin?  Yes, it does.  It's a little segmented body.  Everything has a chin.  Let me see the tapeworm.  This thing's disgusting.  If you look down there, look at its mouth.  It's got like four little orifices with what looks like a drill that they would use.  Wow.  I don't like the looks on these faces. 
[00:45:30]  Parasite's faces are just made for burrowing.  What are they supposed to have?  I don't know.  Mustaches?  Something cute.  If you look halfway down the page on Google Image, someone added a clown face to the worm.  Of course.  Oh, really?  Why wouldn't they?  It's making me laugh, yeah, because it's such an evil thing, and it looks like a little  cute little clown.  Are there any videos of tapeworms coming out or doctors?  There's got to be some video internally. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, there he is.  There's a clown face.  Oh, God.  I want to see video of a fucking tapeworm.  Let's see.  We're looking.  There has to be some.  Oh, look at the little piggies.  There's just all fucking...  They just grip your intestines and stuff.  No, there's a Google, a YouTube video from Monsters Inside Me on the pork tapeworm.  Yeah, that's what we're looking at.  We're watching it.  That's what we're looking at.  Oh, their face is like, yeah, it looks like a friggin' cord drilling machine.  You can't even talk to that thing. 
[00:46:30]  And what, do they just spray shit out of their mouth and dissolve away like your intestine?  Yeah, they just hang out in there and whatever...  They're opportunistic and it's like anything you eat, they take a little bit of it.  Sort of like someone skimming off the vig.  Yeah.  They perish the thought they forget to steal.  Oh, there we go.  Oh, fuck.  Danny can't even look at this stuff.  It's so disturbing to watch. 
[00:47:00]  The hookworm has an ugly face.  Yeah, it's not cute at all.  It's hard to love the hookworm.  You can't shook of that.  Oh, God.  Look, there's video of it.  Oh, that is not right.  I don't like it at all.  Looks like a vacuum hose.  Yeah.  And they grow in like these segments.  But we're not seeing a live fucking tapeworm.  Yeah.  Oh, and then there's some on the brain.  All right, I don't need to know about brain bugs.  I don't need a bug in my brain.  All right, Dr. Steve.  Are we done with Dr. Steve?  I think that was...  Thank you, Steve.  Yes, Dr. Steve, thank you again. 
[00:47:30]  Very informative.  Weird Medicine this Saturday night.  What time?  Midnight Eastern.  Okay, great.  It's a great show.  Yes, Dr. Steve.  Y'all, hookworm, because of the proboscis, it will attach itself.  Proboscis.  How do you say proboscis?  Proboscis.  Okay, I don't know.  Proboscis.  I like proboscis.  I just love when Jimmy goes into character and says the wrong word.  I know, I do.  It's great.  Well, I've never heard that, but the proboscis. 
[00:48:00]  He is getting to do a good Dr. Steve there, Dr. Steve.  Quite namely good.  Drink this.  This will give you tapeworms and then kill them.  I made it myself.  I put my own labels on it.  Dr. Steve's tapeworm.  Tapewine.  Tapewine.  See you, Steve.  Thanks, Dr. Steve.  All right, we should take a break.  It's amazing shit, though, right?  Now I've got to eat after all this.  I know, I'm eating eggs the whole time we're talking.  I would eat pasta. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, my fucking brain just went into a fucking spiral.  Whoa.  I think you've got worms on your brain.  I was going to say pasta and al dente, and I went pasta, dente, pasta.  Dente, pasta, da, da, da, worm.  I think lo mein would be better.  Yes.  If you're thinking tapeworms.  Tapeworms.  A little lo mein action.  My sister shit out pinworm when she was a kid.  Really?  Yeah, she had, from sitting in dirt, she got little teeny pinworms.  Yeah, what, did they just crawl up her asshole?  I guess, she was a kid.  You sit in dirt with your fucking asshole and vagina in the dirt?  Well, in shorts. 
[00:49:00]  In a bikini, if you sit in the dirt, like, you know, in the...  Why is she doing that?  Maybe she was going to make me sit in the grass.  Yeah.  But I remember teasing her, making fun of her.  You did?  Oh, God, yeah.  Pinworms coming up her ass.  Just doing a bunch of pinworm jokes.  But she was crying because her behind me was itching a lot.  How was she dragging her across the floor like a chihuahua?  My mother examined it, and, you know, I don't know how old she was.  She was very young, and she saw, like, a little worm come out and move around.  A little white worm.  Jesus.  So I did a bunch of pinworm jokes.  It was not happening. 
[00:49:30]  I don't want that.  I don't like these shows or these segments.  I got worms on my finger.  My nose.  Damn girl.  All right.  When we get back, we got the latest on the JetBlue guy.  Oh.  And I guess there's songs now all over the Internet.  JetBlue songs, yes.  I bet they're hysterical.  And also there's a Stop the Mosque song as well.  Is it patriotic?  It's horrendous.  It's got to be bad.  We ought to play the, let's see if we could guess what they rhymed the word with. 
[00:50:00]  Ah.  I like doing that.  Yeah, we could do that.  And did you, you didn't take a peek at America's Got Talent, did you?  You hear about this 10-year-old girl?  Liar.  Pinworms up her ass.  Pinworms up her ass.  Oh, go fall.  Liar.  Just screaming.  Overnight sensation.  Really?  Fucking going to be a massive fucking opera star.  What does she do?  Oh, she does opera?  Dude.  We're not opera guys, obviously.  Yeah.  But you got to see what comes out of this 10-year-old's fucking mouth. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, okay.  You want to put it that way?  I'll watch.  You got to see this voice this 10-year-old has.  To the point where everyone thought it was some kind of gag that America's Got Talent was pulling.  And they were getting a shitload of email going, all right, she was lip syncing.  And there was some opera star backstage, right?  Yeah.  As I said, we could do it real fast before break.  Yeah.  Is that her?  This chick is 10.  That looks so fake. 
[00:51:00]  That does look fake.  Right.  She's 10.  You're listening to a 10-year-old.  What's with the fog machine?  And now her feet have fog on them.  You don't have to jazz this up.  This is amazing on its own.  I would just fucking give her the X. 
[00:51:30]  Man.  Yeah.  Simpsons Sabbath, bitch.  Let her cry.  The world is talking about this broad today.  This little broad.  Little lungs like condoms.  How could you belt out fucking songs like that?  And there's no backup vocals at all, right? 
[00:52:00]  Nothing.  I'm telling you, the world is like, what the fuck is this?  She's going to be hot.  You can tell, right?  Wow.  Goddamn.  Standing ovation.  From everybody.  I'd hate to be a comic going on after that.  Right.  Standing ovation for opera. 
[00:52:30]  I'm waiting for the lady to come out who was really singing that.  That was her voice.  That was me.  That was me.  And now she talks with her stupid little voice.  Yeah.  How does that happen?  Howie.  You know what?  We were going to do this show and we all said at the beginning, it's kind of scary.  And all we want to do is find that one moment, that one gem, that one star from a place we've never looked before in America.  And we're still looking.  You know what? 
[00:53:00]  This is the moment.  You're the star.  This is amazing.  Wow.  Here's.  Are you sure you're not 30?  You're not just very small, right?  You are 10 years old.  10 years old.  Exactly.  That is, I'm going to tell you, that is one of the most extraordinary performances I've ever seen on America.  Now Sharon's going to say, I thought you were wonderful and lovely.  You've got the whole thing.  You've got a lovely smile, beautiful dress, and then you start to sing. 
[00:53:30]  And everyone in this audience probably felt the way that I did.  We all felt goosebumps.  That moment when you think, I know what I know.  We all got a big tent in the front of our undershorts.  Our trousers.  And we realised that age is nothing but a number.  And you should be able to make love at any age you feel fit.  I think we all felt the same way.  That any mouth that could make that sound could really milk you for every drop of fluid.  When I first started to sing, I thought, is this for real? 
[00:54:00]  I can't believe that from this tiny body, this huge mature voice that you have.  It is absolutely amazing.  I can't believe it.  And I've never seen anything like it.  How do you feel, Jackie?  I feel so amazed and so happy that you're listening to me.  No way.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  How does that voice sound?  I don't know.  They're going to put you on OzFest so they can throw water bottles at you like your Papa Roach. 
[00:54:30]  Thank you for being here.  Love that.  They boot her at OzFest.  They put her up between crew and Ozzy.  She's fucking got booed.  She's just got shit thrown at her.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Pretty fucked up, isn't it?  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  She's adorable.  All right.  We'll take a break.  We'll get into the JetBlue fucking latest thing.  Yeah.  Now they're trying to just knock this guy down.  Of course.  That's what you do, right?  This is the quickest turnaround ever. 
[00:55:00]  This is like wrestling heel turn shit.  Yeah.  Now they're talking to the passengers and they're basically saying he was a complete asshole the  entire fucking flight.  Now they've got to knock him down a few notches because, you know, we can't have  a feel-good story in America.  No.  But you know what, though?  We've all had that flight attendant.  He had to be a prick.  He finally had it.  Yeah.  Whatever.  We'll have the latest.  I guess he has an ex-wife.  What?  What the fuck?  What happened there?  He realized that was a mistake.  Ew.  When did you realize it was time to get divorced? 
[00:55:30]  When he licked my pussy and threw up for three hours.  Yeah.  He was looking for an escape shoot.  And he saw my...  Well, whatever.  He said he felt like he was tongue-kissing a giant hookworm.  When I pulled out my...  I pulled out my pants and he looked at it and went,  Boo!  Boo!  How did she not know?  What the fuck?  Boo!  Yeah.  I showed him my vagina and he uppercutted it and ran out the door in his bathrobe.  That's how I knew.  When he was squeezing my tits and he called them pecs. 
[00:56:00]  He would only fuck my ass and make me talk in a Humphrey Bogart voice.  Look at him.  He's all over the news.  Yeah.  Well, we got the latest on him next.  Stay there.  Virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I'll be my heart. 
[00:56:30]  I'll be my heart.  I'll be my heart.  I'll be my heart. 
[00:57:00]  I'll be my heart.  Fuck, you know.  Fucking panicky Pete.  Oh, God.  Stupid E-Rock runs in.  Oh, my...  You guys are on the air.  You're on.  No shit.  Been doing this for 30 fucking years.  30.  We figured out the trick, and I'm going to be honest.  Yeah.  There is a part of us as adults that was both thinking of magic.  Well, no one knows what we're talking about.  Oh, we're talking about this off air?  Yeah, we are.  Oh, I'm sorry.  We're talking about America's Got Talent, and...  Look, it is quite amazing. 
[00:57:30]  You just keep going back and forth.  Oh, okay.  These quick change people.  Yeah.  So they also, last night on America's Got Talent, had the quick change people.  You might want to fucking do a little search on your own to check out this act, which is pretty fucking amazing.  You want to explain it, Anthony?  It's two people, a guy and a girl, and they go around to this Corn Bowl music, and they're wearing various costumes.  And then, with just the blink of an eye, where they're covered by barely any material, their costumes are completely changed. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, Danny's right, you caught her hands.  You can see them, you can see her hand right there.  Her hand's ready, it's on her chest, she pulls something, and another dress opens up.  It's all in the costumes, and how they're fastened, and...  And not only fastened, but how they're made, that's all custom, I mean, completely custom clothing.  I'll bet you she's got, like, a whole bunch of them, and she probably keeps them in a pocket or something, right? 
[00:58:30]  Exactly, Chip.  That's what I was thinking.  So there's a quick release, and then the dress is inside out, basically.  Yeah, it is amazing.  I mean, it must take an unbelievable amount of practice to do it, and not get caught.  The dress is changing in front of your eyes, basically.  But video like this on YouTube has destroyed it, because you could just keep stopping the video and looking at every frame,  and seeing, we saw exactly how she did one of them. 
[00:59:00]  Right.  The guy pulled one of those, and it's a normal magician ring with the material around it,  almost like an oldie kind of shower curtain.  Right.  And he pulls it up, and her head is still exposed.  Right.  But you can't see her shoulders, and you see his hand is behind her, and he's the one pulling whatever fastener,  and her shoulder straps come apart, and from the top down, the whole thing unfurls as a brand-new dress in a split second.  And you could see the purple covering the green, and now we know how it's done. 
[00:59:30]  But check it out for yourself.  Quick Change.  Oh, this is Quick Change Revealed now.  Oh, Revealed.  We just found it on YouTube.  We love when magic tricks are revealed.  Everyone know how they did it.  I think I can show you.  If you first watch it, though, you may skip through this part if you want.  Okay.  Because we saw it.  Yeah.  All right.  Now they're going to reveal.  It is amazing.  They're very, very timed out well.  They're very good.  Yeah.  How come she didn't put a baseball uniform on?  Notice the blue thing at the bottom. 
[01:00:00]  Okay.  All right.  Pulls it up.  Pulls the blue thing up to the old clothes.  Off revealing the new.  Off revealing the new.  Made easy by Velcro, possibly.  The red is ripped off as she walks into the yellow dress before.  All right.  This guy's revealing anything.  He's guessing.  He's going, maybe it's not magic.  Thanks, scumbag.  Yeah.  She's not going to wear.  Wait a minute.  You can actually go back a little bit.  I can actually see.  Throw her the dress or something? 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, you can see her at the floor.  Watch.  Yeah.  That's the dress.  Oh, she actually holds it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, she handed it to her.  That was a fake dress.  All right.  This guy doesn't know anything.  This guy doesn't know anywhere, and there's a lot of reading.  Check it out.  Quick change.  It's an amazing act.  It really is.  It's just a bunch of tricked-out clothing.  I was hoping it was magic.  I hoped it was, too, but it's not.  Do you think we'll ever see real magic? 
[01:01:00]  Magic.  Maybe.  Maybe we'll see real magic someday.  In the old days.  Yeah.  Hey, let's get the latest on the JetBlue guy.  He's kind of a working man's hero, but now we're trying to make him into a jerk, because  that's what we do in America.  Yeah, this is the quickest teardown ever.  Yeah.  He went from jerk to, wow, I love this guy.  He fucking did what he wanted to do.  Back to jerk.  Well, now everyone's just trying to say, well, he's a real fucking asshole. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  He was a problem the entire flight.  Well, yeah, he knew that day he was just about done with JetBlue and being a flight  attendant.  Yeah, he was close enough.  So, of course, he was going to be a jerk the entire flight.  It wasn't one, just one incident.  Kenny, I could have had a V8.  I've got one.  Thank you, sir.  Here's the latest on JetBlue guy.  I think he probably still would like it.  Oh, you know what?  This is the ex-wife.  Oh, really?  Yes.  He ran away from me when I took my clothes off on our honeymoon. 
[01:02:00]  I knew there was a problem.  The ex-wife, Jimmy, of the JetBlue.  Oh, yes.  Here we go.  I think he probably still would like his job at JetBlue.  I really think that this is just one of those situations that shows sort of the state of  the world today.  I find it more offensive that this passenger isn't being put on trial than Stephen being  put on trial.  I see it every...  Well, see, the passenger was acting up a little bit, but Stephen pulled the emergency chute. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  Something, by the way, that was a dream of his.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He said he always wanted to do that.  Oh, very cool.  This guy is also...  Look, I know the passenger sucked, and hopefully she's suffering from pancreatic cancer, but  he's also a douchebag.  Yeah.  He's a douchebag.  I get it.  But the bottom line is you told the passengers to fuck off, and you pulled the chute.  Yeah, you can't do that.  It's not like he yelled at one person, and it was overheard, and he walked out.  You pulled the chute.  Right.  You can't do that. 
[01:03:00]  That's what you should do when there's a fire.  You're not allowed to.  If I, right now, no matter how unreasonable people are here, if I had a fight at another  DJ, and I went, fuck you, and pulled the fire alarm, and rappelled down the side of  the building, I'm not a hero.  I'm an asshole.  He caused a major problem.  Of course he did.  Reverend Al, really quickly, Reverend Al organizing rally following Harlem shooting.  Could somebody please get Reverend Al's audio? 
[01:03:30]  He's on Channel 5 right now talking about it.  Was this a black-on-black crime, though?  Spanish or Latin, but there was guns involved.  Yeah, the police and shooting was involved, so of course, Reverend Al's got to come out  and criticize the cops, I'm sure.  Are the officers all white?  I would love to know that.  I don't know.  I don't know.  We need the facts behind this one.  There's a block party going on, where if three people north of 125th Street have a block  party, it's going to end in gunfire. 
[01:04:00]  When is it just the fault of the participants?  When are the police right in this asshole's mind?  Not, uh...  Oh, that'll never happen.  Ever?  Are white cops...  That'll never happen.  ...or any cops ever right?  No.  No.  No.  Never?  And you know what the big thing is?  Oh, my God.  They shot this guy 22 times.  I believe he holds the record for the most times shot and not killed.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  That'd be cool.  Tough fucker.  Yeah. 
[01:04:30]  So, uh...  And there were 50 shots fired.  And, um...  You know, you're talking about a few cops just emptying out one magazine.  It's not like one cop sat there reloading and shooting 50 times.  It's a gunfire episode.  Doesn't that take, like, a second?  A couple seconds, whatever?  Oh, my God.  You can hold a clip in no time.  Yeah, a lot of people think it's bang.  No.  People just don't understand.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  You're trying to fucking see where it's coming from.  You're shooting back.  By the way, I believe... 
[01:05:00]  See the guy with the gun?  I'm sorry.  In his apartment, I believe this is the guy, they found a bunch of Coke packets and $87,000.  Oh, well.  I believe.  Well, he probably was saving up for college, Jimmy.  So, he's obviously an enterprising young man.  Yes.  Yes.  What a wonderful person.  And I've been to just...  At the end of the month in D.C.  What's going on with that?  August 28th is the 47th anniversary of the March on Washington, where Dr. King made the  speech, I have a dream.  Yeah, you're just like him.  We, Martin Luther King III, Mark Morial of the Urban League, many of us are coming together 
[01:05:30]  to not only celebrate that, because 47 years later, many of us, I was only eight years old,  couldn't go.  We're celebrating that that march led to a lot of progress.  We now have an African-American president, two African-American governors, but that we still  have a way to go.  So, in education, we have to close the education gap.  This guy's a twat.  Close the education gap.  What do you mean?  Pot.  Just to go to school.  Just go to school.  You know what? 
[01:06:00]  It's pretty logical.  I'm very simple.  I'm a simple man.  I do realize they might not have the best tools in their schools, but how about you just at  least go?  Well, you know, it starts with going to school.  It's all about paying taxes, and that goes to schools.  And if you're living in a community where no one is paying fucking taxes because no one's  working, and everyone's on the government till, the schools aren't getting a lot of money.  You know?  How about clean up your fucking own neighborhood? 
[01:06:30]  Get some industry going in your own neighborhood.  That way, the schools will get more money, and people will get a better education.  And stop fucking gangbanging in school.  No one can learn if there's gangbanging going on.  How do you know there's gangbanging going on?  I know about the gangbanging.  How do you know?  I saw it on TV.  All right.  There you go.  Can we get back to JetBlue Guy?  Yay!  JetBlue Guy's ex-wife.  I want to start the clip over because we did a little off-roading there. 
[01:07:00]  Funny you hear that.  I think he probably still would like his job at JetBlue.  I really think that this is just one of those situations that shows sort of the state of  the world today.  I find it more offensive that this passenger isn't being put on trial than Stephen being  put on trial.  Stephen.  I see it every time that I'm at a grocery store, a department store.  People miss just treating poorly.  The clerks, our service personnel, I think everybody in America should have to work in 
[01:07:30]  retail or in service for two years to have a sense of humility and compassion about service  people.  You know what?  Don't fuck yourself.  Most of those people are assholes to deal with.  Yep.  Yeah.  They're complete assholes to deal with.  Right?  Yes.  Thank you.  She continues talking.  I want to hear about the sex life.  He definitely exited in a grand fashion.  He is a dramatic fellow. 
[01:08:00]  He certainly is flamboyant, you could say.  I thought she was talking about how the marriage ended.  He exited in grand fashion.  He certainly did.  He came home one day with a cock in his ass.  He definitely exited in a grand fashion.  He is a dramatic fellow, so I wouldn't expect any less of him.  I think he's fabulous.  There is nothing I could think other than how he would do that. 
[01:08:30]  I think he just had enough.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He exited down the old poop chute, as he liked to call it.  His dramatic exit from the marriage was he pointed at his dick and he said, I'm not going  to put him through this anymore.  Oh, man.  Fucking guy, man.  Just a regular Joe.  And now he's...  You know he has 100,000 Facebook friends?  Doesn't take much these days.  That's all it takes.  Doesn't take much these days. 
[01:09:00]  100,000.  Actually, that number is probably a lot higher by now.  That was yesterday.  He just liked people saying, we're all behind you because he's gay.  He'll be in the news for a couple more days and then...  And then fade away.  And then bye-bye.  He'll notice, why are my friends dropping?  Yeah, but you know what?  He got that instant fame where he can now write a book.  He's got a book in his future.  Yes, he does. 
[01:09:30]  I mean, the late night shows don't pay, so how is he going to make money now?  The title of the book?  Yeah.  Down the Chute.  Ah, Down the Chute.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or, uh...  What will his book be?  It'll have something to do with the chute.  Like throwing it all away and sliding down the chute.  It'll be some type of a combination.  Oh, with a title and then kind of a subtitle in there, too.  Yeah, the, uh...  The Story of a Moe.  America's, yeah.  America's favorite pillow biter. 
[01:10:00]  And his ass-fuck adventures.  Imagine if it was just vulgar.  Down the Hatch.  How I Left the Plane and What I Do with Cum.  That's the subtitle?  Yeah.  I love it.  The subtitle says it all.  Jet Blue.  B-L-E-W.  Right.  It's got him with a dick, like, by his face, but it's painted like a plane.  Yeah.  Painted like Jet Blue Plane.  It's got little windows on the shaft. 
[01:10:30]  Jet Black.  He is so gay.  How is he married?  Boy, he was in denial for a while.  It's a possibility, Rosanna.  I'm not buying it yet.  Don't shatter the legend.  We'll see.  Meanwhile, a massive statue goes up in Times Square depicting one of America's most historic moments.  It's that sailor who...  When the sailor date-raped the nurse we had never met before.  That, uh, the nurse.  That was the 40s.  You could do that.  Do they know each other?  I think that's right.  I think the other...  I think we know about this story.  I thought it was a spontaneous kiss. 
[01:11:00]  It was a spontaneous kiss.  It looks so wonderful.  All right, good day New York is coming right back.  She probably, right after that, just smacked him in the face.  He yelled rape.  Mash her.  Cops looked for him.  He went into a brothel.  Got some fucking gonorrhea.  Spread it.  Punched some fucking Asian massage girl in the teeth.  Fucking Jap, bitch.  Horrible racist.  He went back.  Fucking lynched a few darkies within three weeks of being home.  Holy shit.  He was just grabbing women and kissing them because he thought he was allowed to now. 
[01:11:30]  That was right after he got back from the fucking...  The big one.  Where they had nuked Japan.  Yeah.  And he had probably committed a few fucking rapes.  A few atrocities.  As the Allies fucking cleaned up Europe.  Yeah, burned the house of a Polak and raped his family.  This nurse looks like her.  Just walked around Times Square with his cock hanging out the rest of the night.  And he wasn't even kissing her.  He was biting her mouth.  He was so angry that he grabbed her by the hair and bit her mouth that he was mumbling  cunt. 
[01:12:00]  Someone thought that she was holding her hat.  It's like, oh.  Holy shit.  The untold story.  Wow.  All right.  Oh, yeah, sure.  Why don't we go to DJ in Queens?  Oh, this is the DJ.  Of course.  Hi, sir.  What's up, DJ?  Oh, listen.  I had to respond.  I called a few weeks ago.  And I got so many great responses last time I spoke to you guys.  So I wanted to chime in again. 
[01:12:30]  Usually when Anthony goes into a racial connection, I feel the need to come in and kind of add some  clarity.  Yeah.  I also have to apologize, Anthony, because last time we spoke, you went out about this  whole thing, the Florida shooting.  And some cops were shot in Florida.  I didn't really give them a solid answer about the black-on-black crime thing.  Right.  I don't want to belabor the issue too much, but the bottom line is, I told you about white  folks not needing to discern between black people.  Well, I should have gotten a little further than that and basically say that there's such 
[01:13:00]  a thing as black trash.  Just like you have white trash, you have black trash, right?  But my problem is, I don't think, I think you need to really make that distinction.  You can't have it where everybody is going to be labeled as black trash when they're not.  Right.  I've made that distinction.  I just have always said that it's a disproportionate number based on population, is all I'm saying.  I'm not disputing that, but on another level, as far as what to do about it, if you could 
[01:13:30]  take the microphone away from the Al Sharpton, as if he's the official spokesperson of black  people, that might tone down some of the stuff and start instilling martial law in some of  the areas that we know are affected.  Oh, I like that idea.  We know Camden has a certain way of getting down, as they say.  We know that East New York has problems.  We know that East St. Louis has problems.  Oakland, I can go on and on.  We know these areas. 
[01:14:00]  And unfortunately, if you're dealing with certain people that are killing other folks, regardless  of the race, if it's an eight-year-old boy that can't play in a park somewhere because  he's getting shot a half a block away, or the grandmother is lucky enough to make it to  95 years of age, and all of a sudden she's minding her own business and gets shot in a living  room.  Young captain.  That's not the way to live.  But you have to start making it where these people are controlled.  Serious.  Here's the thing with Sharpton being a black spokesman. 
[01:14:30]  In order for that not to happen, black people have to break ranks, which they don't like  doing, and start, black people don't call Sharpton.  I know most black people think Sharpton's an ass.  We hear it all the time.  But they don't call him out publicly, and you don't hear other black leaders, or black  public figures, fuck the word leader, saying, you know what, he's a moron.  You hear white guys fighting it out all the time.  You never hear, or very rarely do you hear, black people breaking ranks and arguing publicly 
[01:15:00]  and going, don't credit him.  Look like a white guy would be called out and go, look at the racist things he said.  Look at the things this jackass has said over the years.  How about they start by calling him an opportunist?  Of course he is.  Yeah, he totally is.  He's plugging his march.  I think you have black folks that, I know that black people think that way.  I meet them all the time.  Yes.  The mic is not given to them.  Fox will not.  Not true.  Not true.  DJ, somebody's got to call out Reverend Al on TV. 
[01:15:30]  And the mic for phone.  And you just will not see it for some reason.  And the guys on Fox will do it, the black guys.  But it's not just about Fox.  They're like, oh, well, they're just shields of Fox.  It's about CNN.  It's other black, prominent black people who are in the news.  Never call him out.  When David Duke went to start his political career, a lot of white people came out and bashed  him.  And I was a former Klansman and a racist and a separatist, whatever you want to call it.  But a lot of people came out and said, well, this guy doesn't represent me. 
[01:16:00]  When you get an Al Sharpton, you might.  And I've heard from black people saying, look, Al Sharpton is not my leader.  But you know what?  When it comes to either agreeing with Al Sharpton or agreeing with white people or or policemen  that are under investigation for some completely justified shooting, you'll always hear them  go to the Al Sharpton side and rarely to the defense of police officers or white people  involved in some kind of problem.  Al is sticking his fucking face in. 
[01:16:30]  Well, listen, there's a guy.  You guys in the radio business, of course, you might have heard of this guy, Ken Hamblin,  the Black Avenger, so he could be known for wearing a fedora.  No, no, no.  Black guy with a fedora?  He could wear a fedora.  One of his trademark names.  Yeah, I know.  He wrote this book called Pick a Better Country.  And he clearly did the notes about all these different types of black people and talking  and using the term black trash.  You have all these folks like whether it's Thomas Sowell, whether it's John McWhorter, 
[01:17:00]  there's plenty of people that I interview on my show.  I thought you guys could do my own thing on the internet.  I interviewed people because on black video, they're not interviewed.  So, I mean, we're not hearing certain people.  That's the issue.  Like I said, I said, if you have black folks that are conservative, and even if they're  not politically conservative, they're definitely socially conservative.  But for whatever reason, I think the power that be will prefer for the world to think 
[01:17:30]  that we all think monolithically.  And I said before, if you can get rid of all this, this need to portray us in a certain  way.  Get this martial law going on.  Because, listen, if Garden City, Long Island, was going through some hellish situation,  it'll be under martial law.  There'll be no discussion about it.  You cannot be in a world where, again, a child, a grandparent, or innocent person is  just due to collateral damage by other black people, and that just gets a pass. 
[01:18:00]  That's just the way it is.  I hear you.  No, no, I agree with you.  But one thing, sir, is it's not just people not...  Black people have to be unafraid after this point to quote-unquote break ranks.  Black people have to be willing to publicly call out the Panthers for the bullshit they  pulled at the poll.  And I was wrong about that when we first argued about it.  I was wrong.  The more I've looked into it and the more I've heard the Panthers speak, I was incorrect.  The black people should be calling them out.  The problem is there's still this us mentality because whites are still dominant. 
[01:18:30]  It's like they can't keep thinking, like, if you break ranks, you're a sellout or you're  the house slave.  That mentality's got to change.  There's such a negative connotation with breaking ranks and going to the enemy's side when it's  just the side that is kind of right.  It's just the correct side, whether it's black or white.  You know, whatever it is, I think you can make up your mind.  You don't have to base it always on racial lines. 
[01:19:00]  All right.  Thanks very much, man.  Thank you.  Listen to DJ's show, Fuck Whitey.  That's right.  Where can you listen to Fuck Whitey?  Where's your show?  AfroNoradio.com.  AfroNoradio.com?  Right.  Okay, man.  Thanks a lot.  Take it to you, man.  I thought it was AfroNerd.  Yeah, AfroNerd.  Oh, is it AfroNerd?  I'm sorry.  I don't know.  DJ.  Right.  Right.  I called you each of them.  Yeah, AfroNerd.  AfroNerd?  AfroNerd.  N-E-R-D.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[01:19:30]  AfroNerd.  Okay.  My fault.  It's because you're black.  We couldn't understand that.  Hey, this discussion leads to this.  A Bridgeport couple is the target of a federal housing discrimination suit.  They're accused of refusing to sell their home to another couple because the potential  buyers are African-American.  Well, Robin, the charges allege that Daniel and...  That's pretty fucked up.  Because you don't care.  You're leaving the neighborhood.  Well, I know.  He's got to be a good neighbor.  The poor neighbor, though.  You know, he doesn't want to have to start singing, the house next door to me. 
[01:20:00]  In this day and age, it's really tough to sell your house to begin with, so...  Yeah, if someone's willing to buy.  Who gives a shit as long as they're willing to buy?  Oh, boy.  And then you're leaving the neighborhood, so why do you care?  Well, Robin, the charges allege that Daniel and Adrian Sabia and their real estate agent,  Jeff Lowe, stalled negotiations and took their property off the market after learning  the prospective buyers are black.  The charges are outlined in a federal suit filed today. 
[01:20:30]  The prospective buyers in this case are nationally syndicated radio personality and comedian George  Wilburn and his wife, Peyton.  They say they had looked at 30 to 40 houses before finding this Bridgeport home and falling  in love with it back in January.  The house had been on the market for two years and was reduced from almost $2 million to just  under $1.8 million.  The suit claims the two couples had settled on a selling price of $1.7 million, the highest 
[01:21:00]  offer the Sabias had received.  But the suit alleges the Sabias refused to close the deal after learning the Wilburns are  black.  The Wilburns' suspicions were confirmed after the Sabias' realtor told a HUD investigator  that Daniel Sabia preferred not to sell to a black family.  The Wilburns are outraged.  Oh, this is a fucked up story, man.  Outraged.  He fucked with the wrong guy.  He fucked with a comic with a radio show who has probably been fucking yapping about  this on the air.  Ooh.  Yep. 
[01:21:30]  Fucked up, though.  Zoits.  That's kind of shitty.  Why does that couple care?  You can't do that.  It's against the law.  I mean, that's...  Yeah, no, I understand that.  You can't do it, but...  And especially, it's like, this guy's a fucking...  This guy and his wife obviously have the money.  The guy's obviously a responsible dude with a fucking...  Doesn't matter.  No reason to do that.  What?  Sell the house to him?  No.  Oh, see, I took it the other way.  That's fucking awful.  It's unacceptable.  That word keeps coming in my mind because that's what it is.  And people who do this and companies who allow it, real estate, anybody who allows this to 
[01:22:00]  happen should be held accountable.  In filing the suit, HUD released a statement that reads in part, racial fairness is important  at all income levels.  Civil rights enforcement must be an effective shield against housing discrimination that  in this case, wealth was not.  Prudential Rubloff Properties, the real estate broker is also named in the suit.  All respondents are accused of violating the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits housing 
[01:22:30]  discrimination based on race and other factors.  The Wilburns say they've received threatening emails since filing the complaint with HUD in  fear for their family.  They say they no longer want anything to do with that house.  We were unsuccessful in contacting the Savias for their response to this suit.  The Wilburns say that they will be seeking punitive damages.  Oh boy.  It's rare that I side with the plaintiff in a suit like this.  That's usually annoying, but you got to side with the fucking Wilburns.  That's just shitty. 
[01:23:00]  You can't not sell a guy a fucking...  A guy wants to buy a $1.7 million house and you're not going to sell it to him?  Fuck that.  No, they couldn't get in touch with the people that own the house because they were having  a block party with the rest of the neighbors being hoisted in the air as heroes.  Jesus.  They're calling the new Savi away, they're going to name that.  Savi away.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 
[01:23:30]  fucked up story you just you just you can't do that that is yeah the guy i guess there's an uh  there is a mindset that there's going to be problems if your whole neighborhood 
[01:24:00]  is crack houses and you got gang members moving in and whatnot but this i think is more of a class  thing than a race thing you get a successful uh black couple moving into a 1.7 million dollar  house in the neighborhood i don't think there's going to be shenanigans going on people are scared  people are scared of things like the neighborhood going to shit and you know something i'll be honest  it's probably a viable concern in some circumstances now the law says you cannot discriminate uh against 
[01:24:30]  uh people of different races that want to buy your house but i'm sure there are some neighborhoods that  don't fall into that very wealthy neighborhood uh or class of houses where uh neighborhoods and  it's happened it's happened in the suburbs of detroit it's having i mean they've had to pull  back the borders of detroit just to make detroit smaller to try to get rid of some of the horrible 
[01:25:00]  statistics that they have there because the suburbs are just crumbling uh so it does happen and i i do  see why people are fearful of it but i don't think it applies in this circuit yeah this is just a guy  being uh it seems like he's being just a racist asshole yeah yeah um you know you just can't do it  you can't not sell you're sure he didn't get a better offer for somebody else and then you know  they said this was the highest offer  oh my goodness 
[01:25:30]  let's say hi to dave in dc dave hey dave hey happy birthday jenny  um i wanted to let you know that we kind of had a uh an almost a reverse situation out by where uh  i live out in the suburbs of uh grand old dc we've got a uh a black neighbor and when they're across  the street uh we've had a corner to uh to my house put their house up on the market they actually 
[01:26:00]  went over and said we want you to only sell your house to a black family hmm all right  i'm sure it happens both ways sure you know this just not to not to ignore your amazing life-changing  point but patrice to get it to get into patrice's head for a second like patrice would say now you  see what we you see what i mean this patrice's head turn into a giant hamburger yeah oh that's 
[01:26:30]  fucking hilarious sorry patrice you know i love you oh my god imagine as smart as patrice is if  that's all he thinks of is giant hamburgers with legs walking in now he would say i think he would  say more cartoon stuff i'd love it this is happens all the time he would say this is how obvious it has  to be for white people to acknowledge it like it actually the real estate person had to come out 
[01:27:00]  and say yes they said don't sell the black people yeah because if they didn't say that if the real  estate person did not reveal that plausible deniability white people would go oh come on  he just didn't want to sell that family it's not a racial thing like it has to be that obvious yeah  yeah for white people to admit that it exists now i'm out of patrice's head and it feels much better  already to be outside i don't like being in your head i uh i live in a very diverse neighborhood  it's uh rich and richer as bush would say the haves and have nots it's uh you're the diversity 
[01:27:30]  i am it's all jews and one filth bag i'm i am the yeah i am the uh what would be called the uh n word  of the neighborhood uh yeah it's all jewish people and um a couple of engines a couple of engines rich  engine like doctors and stuff in the neighborhood and i'm the you know filthy guinea that uh puts up  his gaudy dumb christmas lights instead of a menorah in the window has uh parties and um gets home very 
[01:28:00]  early in the daytime uh and no one knows what i do i'm sure they think i'm in the mafia i'm sure  i was like what else would you think we think you're in the mafia here's some fucking some guinea  coming home in his escalade at at in the morning yeah we've talked about that and it's just like oh  okay i see you leaving at weird hours and coming home very early and my neighbors don't talk to me 
[01:28:30]  why would they yeah i don't mind i don't i don't care but uh you know i feel discriminated against i'm  going to file suit just trying to think what i would think if i found out like the house next  door to me was sold was sold um to a black dentist in his family it would bother me why really and the  truth of the matter is no if it's not uh you know oh it wouldn't bother you ones in the crypts moving  in no because it doesn't it's not a race thing it's a crime thing it's a a a quality of life thing 
[01:29:00]  and uh i i wouldn't mind yeah some professional black family wants to move next to me as long as  they don't have kids because they're always trouble i mean just kids in general white black whatever if  i have to toss the basketball over my fence one more time for the little kid next door and they're  white exactly that's why they're awful i know it would hit the friggin rim every time they're going 
[01:29:30]  these kids are just winging it over the backboard you know how you saw that mister you know how you  solve that problem you pop your head over the fence with the basketball with the knife and just  throw it back thought it makes that thud in the driveway bounce anymore guess what you're not  getting any more basketballs hey mister can i have my basketball me can i tell you a funny tweet i got  which has nothing to do with what we're talking about it just made me laugh do a biff tannin and  throw it up on this roof yes sir i'm sorry i don't know it's fine what did you get this guy just 
[01:30:00]  wrote i got the hot garbage farts i should go share these hot and putrid treats with the wife  rather than shame the dogs funny people out there just do hot garbage that's just a guy just farting  and realizing i want to go give these to my wife oh my god that's horrible isn't that great that really  brings your numbers down in a marriage i think oh yeah farting not only farting but like purposefully  farting in their presence really nasty ones things like that you could get away with it as long as 
[01:30:30]  you say i'm embarrassed after you do it i'm embarrassed yeah so what you're gonna do tell  yourself that i'm embarrassed can we take a break and get into the stop the mosque song after the  break we sure can and what david uh patterson's offering some what tax breaks or something it's not  gonna matter they're not gonna accept it they're not going to no of course no we'll get it uh  we'll get into the latest on the mosque at the ground zero a lot of people outraged outrage are 
[01:31:00]  you outraged i am uh no i i'm i don't have time to be outraged no i i am outraged about that i think  it's a slap in the face of uh everybody uh in the country first of all and then especially a slap in  the face of um uh people that had to go through that shit yeah disgusting sensitive it is and why  as jimmy stated uh why do we have to be the sensitive ones and the tolerant ones and the  ones that say no we should open our arms and accept this as a gesture of peace and look what we can do 
[01:31:30]  instead of these muslims saying hey we should open our arms and uh give a gesture of peace and  understanding by not putting it there and realize that we can uh understand people's uh emotions and  how hurt they are and not have uh this mosque that represents the religion the extremist religion  that that uh brought down the towers and killed thousands of people yeah how about they they say  that we we uh our religion is a religion of peace but it's also a religious of a religion of  understanding and there's a common sense thing that we kind of get why people wouldn't want it 
[01:32:00]  here and it doesn't mean that they're bigots or hateful right but this was still fresh in everybody's  mind a lot of people died here in the name of this they never will do that you'll be  understanding and yeah how about you be understanding they're not going to be not going  and then them sending this imam over there on on our taxpayer fucking money sending the head of this  mosque over to the middle east to fucking talk about uh uh islam in america and tolerance and how 
[01:32:30]  wonderful this is on our dime this motherfucker is flying over there right we're just whisking him  around to the middle east probably so he could recruit more motherfuckers to come down to his  mosque and i'm sick of him the same thing will happen that happened in england the longer the  mosques become like the mosques are going to be here but they tolerate more and more radical  it's amazing the amount of radical rhetoric we tolerate here and not just speech but speech that  leads to things like that blind cleric that that fucking pig lynn stewart uh defended thank god 
[01:33:00]  she's in jail for all those years now and she's gonna die in jail oh good good that slob  well she was so pretty though it's very rare that i'd rather eat somebody's ass than kiss them  that's how awful she was i'd rather lick the blind cleric's eyeballs and everything you heard we'll say  after the break because uh that's wonderful that's how you handle a radio tease you tease something and  then you it's you you make all your points before the break we pulled a bobo yes no it was uh oscar was 
[01:33:30]  oh i don't think jimmy has met oscar yet you're gonna have to meet oscar soon oh yeah uh but after  the break we will do the stop the mosque song sirius xm the virus i can't believe anyone is still  listening to this show you're listening to obie anthony  cool  all right obie anthony yeah so we got a grammy award-winning producer

[01:46:30]  up there in harlem  uh allegedly  a gentleman  by the name of alvarez  i believe  um  had a revolver  shot and killed  a gentleman  over a dispute  with a  about a woman  who was the family man  i remember watching the news  and they said he was a family man  why i guess  maybe the guy he shot  because i know this guy  was just uh  you know  like jimmy said  they found coke and cash  and all kinds of stuff  in his uh  in his place  so he uh  he shot uh  a gentleman  uh killing him 
[01:47:00]  and then the cops showed up  and the uh  reports are that he started  firing at the police  and the police returned fire  there wasn't just one cop on scene  i think there was something like four  maybe even more  and um  they opened fire on him  hit him 22 times  out of 50 rounds  that were fired  one cop got hit  by another cop's bullet  it hit his vest  and uh  he's alright  but uh  a lot  a lot of bullets flying  is the guy gonna be alright  this guy 
[01:47:30]  it looks like he's gonna pull through  wow  yeah  wow wow wow  well reverend al is uh  doing his uh  dog and pony show  all right  all over the news  and uh  he had this to say today  the message i i got from your  your meeting was that  you know  it's got to start at home  yeah  and that families need to come together  and stop buying these  illegal guns  oh no  i think that  this particular incident  wouldn't have happened  without the gunfire  in the first place  so let's start there  did the police make a mistake  did the police 
[01:48:00]  are they wrong  need more training  i think so  but i think the police  wouldn't have been there  even untrained  if they hadn't been shooting  and if there hasn't been violence  last weekend alone  the bronx  uh  three or four in harlem  brooklyn  we've got to deal with this violence  we've got to deal with parenting  and we've got to challenge  this thug mentality  we cannot back away from that  and as we challenge police  and others to be fair  i don't march and go to jail  for kids to be thugs  in my community  i want them to have  an even playing field 
[01:48:30]  so they can be something  productive and responsible  wow  maybe fucking reverend  reverend al is hearing the voices  what the hell did i just hear  out of reverend al  that's a heel turn  although i like the little bash  on the cops  in the first place  he has to  he had to do that  of course he has to  but that whole thug mentality  but how far is he going to take that  that's a heel turn  because this is the only way  he could get involved in this story  without everyone turning around  and saying  you're a real fuck  just bashing the cops  every time  because now he sees  this is a thug  guy shooting  so he had to come out 
[01:49:00]  with the thug mentality thing  you know how  it had to be that  fucking housing person  admitting  that they said  don't sell to blacks  it had to be that obvious  for him to say this  it had to be  that obvious  yeah  it's almost like  he knows  even he can't pull this off  when guys are shooting  at each other  and the cops show up  yeah he can't just say  the cops are wrong  oh what are they supposed to do  they're being shot at  yeah  and i bet you that  there were not all  white officers then  probably not  we have a very diverse 
[01:49:30]  NYPD now  we sure do  yeah  because well  you know  they change the tests  and change the promotions  and things like they do  with the fire department  because they're racist  and not open for diversity  so you'd rather get  the less qualified person  in there  than the more qualified person  based on race  thank you  that sounds very logical  of course it does  it's the american way  i disagree  let's go to cleveland  andy  hey  morning boys  i don't know 
[01:50:00]  who had it  on their cover  i want to say  was it a time  or news week  but somebody had  reverend al recently  big as life  on their cover  and the picture  speaks volumes  he's wearing  a massively expensive suit  just  he just  he just looks like  the attention pimp  that he is  it's just  it's absolutely  horrible  you know  it's  i don't know  it's a visual  for the radio  but i just can't believe  they gave him the cover  no good job 
[01:50:30]  yeah that was  i really added a lot  yeah i like that  uh let's go to albany  chris  yeah hi  i wanted to uh  when you guys  talk about freedom  of religion  yeah  and the uh  the mosque  i just wanted to  kind of give you  some insider view  on the new york state  prisons  how the uh  mosque  and how they've used  uh freedom of religion  or i should say  the guise of it  to uh  to get different  uh  uh amenities  uh  towards religion  now let me  let me preface this sir  by saying you are  indeed a corrections  officer 
[01:51:00]  uh  actually i  i'm one of the  i work for the union  i uh  oh  mobster  for 28 years  but yeah i'm a  correction officer  okay  all right  so  got to watch  since 1982  got to watch  the uh  the religion  grow  uh  number one  it's a  it's kind of  a breeding ground  for like  anti-american  sentiment  of course it is  and uh  you know  it's more of a  gang thing  which kind of  cracked me up  when you were  just talking  about the  the reverend  out thing  with the  with the 
[01:51:30]  violence  as far as  all the  the different  inmates that  they're letting  out now  uh  much easier  and these are  gang members  that are going  back out  into the community  to teach  and uh  show others  the gang life  but anyway  getting back  in a mosque  on uh  sundays  when we have  catholic  uh  services  if you have  let's say  200 inmates  in a  in a  chapel  you might  have 15  20 officers  in there  and on  right after that  they have  protestant  services  pretty much  the same  thing 
[01:52:00]  but then  on friday  with a  juma  in the mosque  you might  have three  four hundred  inmates  going into  the mosque  can you  imagine how  many officers  are in there  uh  two  zero  really  we're not  allowed in  there  freedom of  religion  they put  the prayer  rug by the  front door  and in  order for us  to enter  we would  have to  remove our  shoes  uh-huh  so what  so you  guys just  allow this  so you  can't have  any security  in there  and listen 
[01:52:30]  to what  what they're  saying and  talking about  or anything  like that  well we hear  we hear things  from the doors  but the doors  are closed  i mean the  the department  does not want  any any  obviously religion  problems  because it  falls under  that guise  of uh  freedom of  religion  so why  doesn't  someone take  their shoes  off to see  what's going  on in there  yeah get  some barefoot  officers in  there  i don't think  you'd find any  officer that'd be  willing to do  that  no  i mean you're  putting yourself  in a serious  situation where  a lot of times  you'd be a hot  foot  if you're in a 
[01:53:00]  uh  uh  uh  a use of  force situation  you want to  have your  shoes on  yeah i would  think so  yeah i think  the safety of  the officers  should trump  as long as  you're not  interfering with  their service  i think you  should be  allowed to  fucking  they should  move the rug  stand in that  fucking place  and then  fucking watch  them  they're plotting  well they figured  it out a long  time ago and  it's been a you  know a long  standing policy so  we don't go in  there and jump  over the rug  exactly jump over  it if they're  going to be mad  we'll use a rope 
[01:53:30]  and pulley system  a pole vaulter  a rope and  pulley  do some mission  impossible shit  a giant slingshot  get there early  ride on someone's  back  that's where  piggyback in  there's so many  solutions we're  giving you  exactly  well we're on the  outside because we  have to number one  if you pat down  the inmates going  in you have to  check all their  koofies you know  what they're hiding  koofies what's a  koofie that's the  thing the prayer  thing they wear on  their head the hat  oh  a hat  so they've uh 
[01:54:00]  and that's even  changed over the  years where it  used to be it had  to be flat to the  head only one  color now it's  multicolored and  it doesn't have to  be flat to the  head and that's  a whole other  story but the most  ironic part of the  whole thing is on  Fridays when you've  got hundreds of  inmates lined up to  go into the  service that that  either wanted um  you know go join the  gang or or have  been in the gang  they uh they've got  this other thing where  they have to cleanse  themselves prior to  the service which  obviously no other 
[01:54:30]  religion has to do so  we have to provide a  sink uh for them so  you've got one line  going in to wash their  hands prior to the  service the other  one's coming out  cleaning their hands  but then going over  and bumping or or  shaking hands with  their newly cleansed  hands with somebody who  has to clean their  hands  what a pain in the  ass  no kidding  god right  i could get into  ramadan but that's  30 days  yeah  we get we get it  chris definitely  all right thank you  we're gonna go uh talk  to a black republican 
[01:55:00]  what  ross  all right  we mean how about  you're the guy  yeah  thank you  a black republican  my god  hey guys how you  doing  yeah well as you  know i'm one of the  few black republicans  and a family full  liberals i've gone to  school filled with  uh liberal democrats  and uh you know i  kind of feel a little  like anthony does i  think as as i get  more and more educated  and as i make more  and more money i start  to you know resent  taxes and on top of 
[01:55:30]  that i um i basically  you know i i know this  right away like you're  talking about reverend  owen this one i don't  know if you mentioned  harry reid what he said  about the hispanics about  how i don't know  yeah absolutely  yeah well let me  let me let me  explain something um  and it kind of it kind  of is in play with um  how uh white people  on the right wing felt  about barack obama  when all the blacks  voted for him like  ninety nine percent  and the thing about it  is uh blacks see him 
[01:56:00]  as representing them  and as a democrat  uh most black people  born right into a democrat  party they don't know  why they're democrats  if you really talk  to them like they  wouldn't be able to  explain to you why  exactly they're democrat  unless they've gotten  to college or unless  they've uh gotten to  grad school then they  can explain to you why  they're a liberal why  they're a conservative  and i think the more  educated they get  they're going to be  fiscally conservative  and i think they're  also going to be you  know some depending  upon their religion or  how much they believe in  god that's how they're 
[01:56:30]  going to sway abortion  or you know pro-life  that's what it depends  how strong you are  there or in the other  place now okay as for  reverend al sharpton  black people have  absolutely no radio  that represents them as  a whole over the entire  country the problem with  blacks is the church  has represented them  since post slavery so  when you have somebody  who's like a reverend  whether it's jesse jackson 
[01:57:00]  or whether it's al sharpton  they have to seriously  say something stupid or  put their foot in their  mouths in order for  people to stop believing  in them jesse jackson  fucked up and said oh  i would like to uh  castrate obama right  after that i noticed  every single black  liberal i knew turned  on jesse jackson said  you know i don't want  to hear anything from  the city anymore well  you know what else he  said too besides  himetown which he was  forgiven for is uh he  said uh he's talking  down to niggas he said  that and even fuck  and this was after  targeting imus and all 
[01:57:30]  these other things  and and fox didn't  even kill him for that  they didn't even replay  that like they should  have no no but  understand something  the reason why fox  didn't say anything  about it was because  we were already on him  for it they didn't say  anything about that  because he was  attacking barack obama  it it's not only a  color thing but on top  of that it's a  political thing and on  top of that there's a  religious aspect now  speaking of religion  the mosque i live in  new york city frankly i  don't have a problem 
[01:58:00]  with them putting a  mosque what pisses me  off is the fact that  ten fucking years later  the world trade center  hasn't been rebuilt  yeah  eleven years it took  eleven years to build  those buildings from  nothing and now i've got  to deal with this  fucking mayor and i've  got to deal with these  other people who you  know who own all that  property and who are  basically all hand in  hand and these people  will not rebuild those  towers  isn't that amazing  it took ten years to  build the world trade  center  here's my question  why don't they do the  democratic thing and 
[01:58:30]  allow the people to  vote for whether or not  there's a mosque and  allow the people to vote  for whether or not there's  the world trade center  bloomberg doesn't like  people voting for things  he likes just making up  his own mind and shit  like that  the problem with that  the problem is people  are so poorly educated  at this point that  they're worried about  fucking snooki on  jersey shore than they  are about what's going  on in the government  well did you  let me ask you a  question too you  mentioned harry reid  do you notice how this  is the second thing he 
[01:59:00]  has said  yes yeah but okay  and they don't target  him the way they would  with somebody else he's  allowed he's given a  pass  i understand where you're  going with this but  understand something  harry reid is a  democrat  harry reid is on  quote unquote our  side yes so if he's  speaking for us and  i've seen this i've seen  this play because harry  reid's comment i can  understand what he was  saying when he was  saying he's like he's  basically saying this  the republicans and  fox news are hand in  hand bashing hispanics 
[01:59:30]  so how the fuck could  you be a hispanic and  want to be a republican  that's all he's  basically saying right  he can't say it in the  language that i'm using  right now because he  would be attacked just  for using you know  for basically implying  that all hispanics should  be democrats in order  to vote rather than be  on the side of the  republicans but he's  allowed the gift of  context that he's given  the leeway of context  because he's on the  right side of most of 
[02:00:00]  the media correct side  the correct side yes  yeah right but you  know harry reid also  made a comment about  barack obama oh yes  um about him being good  or colored or something  i can't remember the  exact comment but the  thing about it is i  take a look at one of  my liberal uncles when  he heard that he  basically said okay  yeah i can understand  what harry reid's saying  now now let me let me be  clear i understand what  harry reid was trying to  say but if sean hannity  said that exact same thing  he would have weird you'd have 
[02:00:30]  had people angry at him but  it's only because he's on  the republican side yeah  yeah presenting the  conservatives so you got to  understand it's not just a  color thing if barack obama  was alan keys i wouldn't have  voted i would have voted for  hillary over him and i'm black  i could if barack obama was a  republican and black people  look turn on the television and  and saw that at the republican  national convention that the 
[02:01:00]  only thing in that crowd was a  bunch of white people wearing  cowboy hats like they did when  they saw sarah palin stand in  there if they saw that then  they'd say wait a minute this  guy is not on our side this guy's  not black enough the thing about  it is that's exactly what you get  with alan keys so you look at  alan keys he throws his lesbian  daughter out because she's a  lesbian alan keys did he really  yes yes he did because he  threw his lesbian daughter out  because he doesn't want gays in  his house and then on top of  that alan keys was on television 
[02:01:30]  calling barack obama radical  communist so right away the first  instinct is to say oh you're an  uncle tom or you're a traitor right  away because of course it's not  just about color it's about us being  in a political party and saying we're  going to back up whoever says  anything regardless what they say  um uh you know and i'm i'm i was  talking about that the muslim  situation that right now with the  mosque you know one of the things i  hate about islam is the fact that 
[02:02:00]  they um recruit out of prison and  they take these black boys who've  been put in prison they take these  hispanic boys too because i have a  hispanic friend who destroyed is  law but they take these people out of  prison uneducated and what they do is  they give them the structure that  they never had at home they give them  a structure they give them a  religious background and all of a  sudden you you see people who have  been slinging crack rock all of a  sudden they're wearing koofies and  they're praying and putting their  head on the ground yeah there were 
[02:02:30]  yeah that's the name of it it's just  like no i know the jewish uh uh  skull cap what's that called a yamaka  you're gonna get it you're gonna get a  bad element if you're recruiting from  the uh prisons i i understand that you  know when i was in when i was in  college i was in college i was surrounded  by liberals and yeah thing about it is  whenever i would speak and say okay i  can understand what newt gangrich is  trying to say or i can understand what  somebody's trying to say right away i'm  attacked and they say oh well you're  just a right winger you're uncle tom yeah 
[02:03:00]  they look past this you have to  understand well again somebody said  blacks don't think one way they don't  think one way there are conservative  blacks out there and the republican  party was the party of the black person  simply with lincoln yes kukuk klan was  the radical wing of the democrat party  why would you why nobody knows that  because nobody knows their history  what uh martin luther king was a  republican i consider myself a  republican but the problem is when the  dixiecrats took over and all of a  sudden you had the people who were in 
[02:03:30]  the kukuk klan start to migrate and  they start to go over to the uh  republican side black people saw that  and they said okay we don't want to be  there anymore so automatically they're  against them yeah so why did you call  that that's no i call every time you  have a racial discussion every time you  have a racial discussion i want to talk  okay actually actually thank you thank  you ross thank you ross so much thank  you for some reason or another you sound a  little taller on radio on radio here's my 
[02:04:00]  favorite part of that clip yes exactly i had  the gift of seeing anthony's hand for  eight minutes hovering over the button  stuck on that button he now has  arthritis waiting well guys uh gap that i  could hit that fucking button and we're  gonna we're gonna wrap up this discussion  with uh bobby muslim bobby muslim is  bobby muslim uh bobby muslim welcome to  the opian anthony show hey what's going  on dude i'm just reading the koran

[02:05:30]  republican really wants to talk because  he's got no one to talk to he's actually  never talk that long no without somebody  walking away or going shut up uncle tom  they're calling him whatever he couldn't  believe that we were being polite i know  well that was wonderful i liked alan  keys i found out on tv they were with  you as long as they could be  showed up some came through the side

[02:12:30]  i don't watch anything dude okay so we  at least have seen web soup yeah i've  walked in where the improvs have these  things with radio shows well and again  this is not in major markets in some of  the smaller markets for some of the  smaller shows that go look we'll give  you we need you to bring the comedian  every week so i know that i'm just  there on the improv time club that the  radio show doesn't care about me yeah  and it doesn't feel good it doesn't i'm  not they don't say it though we're gonna  care about him i'm not saying you're  not i'm just telling you as a guy  walking into a radio i think he's gonna  fit in actually he's got a little edge  to him yeah he's a funny guy let's 
[02:13:00]  say you never know with with people  that come in and i mean who else we  got a new today a new guy that can  hang out with the show it's not  like they're booking for the show  where we have choices oh god leave  this poor guy alone i'm sure chris is  a good guy my issue comedian he can  deal with his shit he's with joel uh  mikhail mikhail not even mikhail it  might be his reps because joel's a good  guy it might be his reps but i'm so  fucking tired you know what we might  have fucking passed on joel once too  though you know so what because i he  started doing our show and then maybe 
[02:13:30]  i'm not sure if we were busy or  whatever but then we passed one time  when he was in town and then it's  gotten weird since then we like joel  on our show it's like there are times  where somebody's in town and you have a  show booked where you're like oh hey  look he's a good guy but we got the  xxxx happening it's like there's  nothing personal with that yeah but  personal it's business let's get our  joel mikhail relationship back  together i have no i have no issues  with care either way to be honest with  you oh look at that i'm the asshole that 
[02:14:00]  was standing out in vegas yeah but  that's not i would if i didn't like  him teasing but that's not going to  get him on the show i don't care nice  i don't care about any of that shit  i'm the dumb motherfucker that was  standing out there doesn't feel good  to hear this stuff you look like it  you look like an idiot i would say  this to joel i'm not mad at him it's  his rep it's like i'm the asshole that  was out there expected to sit there  with a recorder but what's the  difference between saying that and me  saying that we have chris hardwick on  because it's a favor because it's  totally because one yeah it's a  completely different totally  different why because a favor book 
[02:14:30]  implies that we wouldn't have him  otherwise which is not necessarily  true i don't even know if this at all  favor it sounds like a good fit for  the show this chris hardwick and i  know i know i know i'm and i know i  know i'm saying i don't but i know i  do i just don't uh what if we did a  festival together or something you're  gonna feel bad when he comes in and  goes uh hey jim good to see you again  no because i'm very i have a bad  memory not at all no not at all no  no but i know i've heard he's funny  yeah and i would say if i didn't i'm  a lot of our fans seem to like chris 
[02:15:00]  okay good we're looking forward to  having him in i don't know in about  15 minutes or so okay very cool all  right and other things we got a highway  comic we got to get into after the  break what a highway comic he sells  fuck is that he sells jokes to make  people uh feel a little better about  their day what i mean he sells jokes  yeah where highway highway what's that  mean why highway it's a tease you'll  find out all my god i don't understand  they're gonna be here they're not  going anywhere where they're going  it's satellite radio they're not

[02:17:00]  hey chris how are you buddy good how are  you guys welcome to the opian anthony show  you're playing carolines uh starting  tonight right i am yeah as a matter of  fact p.s great job on louis show thank  jim norton thank you that is a fucking  great show and you're gonna sorry that's  exactly what i said would happen that he  would know you yeah we know each other  but i met jim like 10 years ago he wasn't  sure he knew you chris i knew no i said i  don't know where i know i'm from that's  like i know we probably did a festival or  something together he was confused i go  chris is gonna walk in here and go and  say hey jim good to see you again something 
[02:17:30]  like that yeah yeah it's exactly how it  played out no i when i said it was i  lived in new york uh probably like nine  years ago i was doing a a great piece of  television called shipmates and uh and i  was hanging out yeah i know right and i  was hanging out at the comedy cellar a  lot and jim uh that's the man first that's  where i first met yeah jim uh i'm still  there and he's got fucking 1.3 million  twitter followers when we start there how  the fuck do you get 1.3 million twitter  followers because what are you offering the  twitter community because that's what we 
[02:18:00]  all want we all want to hit a million i  don't know i i you know i i work uh i work  in a lot of nerdy fields and so you know  like if you look at if you look at the  early days of twitter who got the most  follower it was all nerds like the guys  who started dig like people who host tech  shows and so i think just kind of being in  that nerdosphere sort of helped that right  yeah and uh on twitter you're op radio so  they right so that's what yeah what happened  i was surprised it wasn't taken i was  surprised that wasn't taken no it's the 
[02:18:30]  nerdist i think just nerdist no the no  nerdist 1.3 million followers self-proclaimed  nerd i guess right i guess so yes geek or  proclaimed by people who stuff me in  trash cans in grade school with my uh chess  sets yeah i would say do you play chess i  do well i don't you know i truthfully i  can't play anymore because i played  competitively in grade school are you one  of those guys and so it's hard for me to  do it now without like having an aneurysm  because i'm i get so intense about it do  you beat people really quickly then is  that why is it what you're really saying 
[02:19:00]  is everyone else sucks because you've been  playing for so long you can't find a  good challenge i'm not sure if that's  exactly what i'm saying i'm saying i'm  it's i've become one of those obsessive  nerds where i'm just like you touch that  piece you have to move it like it's i'm  not fun i'm not fun to play with i'm not  fun prodigy not fun i don't know about  that but i was pretty good you're pretty  damn good who's your favorite chess  player of all time let's talk chess  players oh shit bobby fisher yes me too  just because of his political yes he's  like he was that classic check because  you know most most of these guys who 
[02:19:30]  most of these guys play the big  computers uh you know and they're  russian and you know but bobby fisher  just had so much personality as as just  like a crackpot so uh he was he was a  lot of fun yeah he was a fucking loon can  we start with your t-shirt who is that  steve wozniak i am okay that's a nerd  co-founder of apple founder of apple wow  actually geek not nerd there is a  difference between a geek and a nerd  yeah more geek you know a lot of people  will debate this uh for for hours and i 
[02:20:00]  think that's what i hope to do right  and some people to the delight of your  audience  the fuck they're talking about nerds  no please uh nerds geeks there's they  you know like there's a lot of crossover  but fucking but dweebs that's where i  fucking draw the line dweeb you're not  a dweeb not not not a dweeb fan dweebs  come from old sperm as far as i'm  concerned dweebs can't help anyone no  nerds and geeks can help other people  they can you know nerds and geeks have  the ability to be unnaturally focused  about anything  yeah yeah and uh dweebs are just 
[02:20:30]  socially awkward  i see geeks as being some people that  are a little more uh tech savvy but  have can have a little more fun than a  nerd nerds are people you cannot get  along with  nerds are intense because nerds can  nerd out of everything sports nerds like  any nerds can learn everything but i  think what we're finding is like from  when i was in grade school a lot of the  classic nerds i think if we looked  back we would realize that a lot of  them had asperger's  like a lot of ones are like look at 
[02:21:00]  those nerds like today they'd be like  uh he has asperger's  they're just like quoting statistics  yeah exactly and have no social skills  it just it just wasn't a disorder that  that was that was defined socially  understood back back in those days  he's just a weirdo yeah we did we  we said he was a weirdo  asperger he was he's an odd boy he's  an odd boy strange uh and and how do  you wind up getting into some kind of  you know geek shows if you're geek guy  it doesn't usually work that way  usually you have to do shit you don't 
[02:21:30]  like oh well i did that for a long  time i've just been working for a long  time so it literally took me like 13  years of working  before i was like why am i not working  on nerd stuff because before before the  internet and before the explosion of you  know niche cable channels that's true  you couldn't really like there was not  really nerd programming even as recently  as 10 years ago you could talk about  um soldering together a radio shack  computer to just yourself in the old  days no one else would listen to you  to just yourself and a handful of other 
[02:22:00]  sweaty nerds i really do i consider  myself quite a geek slash nerd and i do  like going through old popular mechanics  and catalogs and looking at radio shack  stuff the old big cb radio i still base  stations they would sell yeah i still have  old omni magazines from when that was  that magazine was was around it's a pc  gamer old things like that because it's  interesting to see the progression of  what happened and uh especially when you  think when you're playing a game even  like the original doom when it came out  yeah it's like it will never get better 
[02:22:30]  than this and then you moved on to like  when half-life first came out i was like  holy shit they finally reached the  pinnacle well now i just tested a alien  where makes a like a 3d gaming computer  that's insane wow insane uh it's  actually good 3d technology really  yeah god damn for uh gaming but i got  my first computer in 1981 and it just  wow it just didn't do anything  commodore or it was a trs80 it was a  oh you went tandy i did tandy nice  remember when radio shack was awesome 
[02:23:00]  and like radio it's so funny that there  was a period where radio shack was on  the forefront of technology yeah and now  like the rest of technology just kind of  rolled over it blew right past you knew  when they started having to put radio  control cars into radio shack yeah that  it was like it was over for uh yeah  right now i know i need a radio that  runs on a wet potato or whatever like  that's all radio shack is now and  connectors wait a radio cars like the  fucking cousin oliver of technology  yeah it's just the admission that it's  over yeah it was pretty much done with  it was because you used to walk in a 
[02:23:30]  radio shack and they did they had like  computers they had a cb radio scanners  you could build your own radios and  stuff and robots or you could just walk  in with a schematics book and pick out  resistors and capacitors and transistors  i still have a lot of like a lot of  early computers were built that way yeah  yeah and and just get a printed circuit  board etch it yourself i used to do  shit like this i made a stun gun and hit  my girlfriend with it just to see if it  worked because i had such lack in my own  how did you have a girlfriend in that  scenario exactly you know you're  absolutely right she would have been a 
[02:24:00]  keeper she did well she was probably  passed out drunk while i was soldering  there you go there you go is soldering a  euphemism for something or you mean  literally yeah it was giving her the  old soda gotcha they put a little flux  on her when i went to sleep last night  my asshole was not uh welded shut did  you are you responsible for this yes  what did the trs-80 do i have to know  that like oh my god nothing it was  basically just like a like a typewriter  yeah and not even really that because  you couldn't really hook it up to a  computer no i mean i mean to it to a  printer uh it was just like one solid 
[02:24:30]  unit and there was a the interface was  was very archaic by computer standards all  of them ran like basic yeah it ran basic  so you like it was good if you were  writing your own stuff but it was really  kind of pre where there was a lot of  consumer friendly software available  yeah before all that though because i  remember getting the uh atari 800 and uh  they had nothing for it and i had a book  on basic uh programming and they'd have 
[02:25:00]  games and it would take you hours to key  in this code fuck you'd have to enter your  own game code and you'd hit to play it  and it would start and then it would like  syntax error line 6300 oh it's so  irritating i i i'm supposed to debug this  shit i just left out like one character  just fucks up the whole code you left out  one fucking number or one little symbol or  something you're done it's dos prompt i  remember that was when we got our into  computers in high school and i i didn't 
[02:25:30]  know much about but that's very familiar  then i came up with the uh cassette load  which was great yeah just plugged in  which was basically just a panasonic  cassette player yeah and games would  come on cassette tapes that would uh you  know they're just magnetic again radio  shack you get those at radio shack yeah  yeah the shack was rocking they were  happening and it would take so long for  a shitty game to load up how long i would  take hours sometimes it would run in like  real time this was before we had short  attention spans though so we were like  pretty soon i'm gonna be in video game 
[02:26:00]  paradise i'm gonna be the controller of  a nuclear power plant that can't melt  down i'm gonna have to keep the the  nuclear rods in the liquid and keep the  turbines running and sometimes something's  gonna fail i thought it was the best  game ever i'm like oh look at the  graphics it's never gonna get better  see i was lucky because my my father my  dad was a professional bowler and then  when he retired he opened a bowling  center and i'm he had an arcade so i  didn't i didn't have to rely as i mean i  had all the home gaming systems but i 
[02:26:30]  also had these the real deal yeah  cabinet arcade games uh yeah dad's  because nothing was worse than playing  pac-man or donkey kong and then playing  the home atari version which was like  what no this isn't it right why is pac-man  square right it's like it's like when  your mom tries to make a burger king  thing at home you're like it's just not  the same just like it's not the same i'll  make you an egg mcmuffin no give me eggs  on an english was your dad was he a good  professional bowler i need to know yeah 
[02:27:00]  yeah he was he's in the hall of fame  wow hardwick really yeah what was his  first name billy billy hardwick not  that i know uh yeah always rings a bell  though it kind of sounds familiar right  you know my dad it's funny my dad was a  professional bowler in the 60s when it  was kind of a like a really cool like they  were actually respected athletes right by  the rest by by other athletes wide world  the sports used to yeah yeah exactly and  so uh yeah so i grew up when did you  break your dad's heart and go dad i don't  want to be a bowler yeah i'm sorry it 
[02:27:30]  worked well for you but you know what  yeah we had we had the talk were you  forced to bowl your whole life no but i  did i bowled i mean any good i was i  was good as a kid any perfect games no  but i shot 289 when i was 11 damn it was  10 strikes and then a 10 pin oh you got  screwed still bugs you doesn't it it really  yes it does the hand roll gave it away  the hand roll gave it away because i you  know i kind of my parents split up when i  was 13 and we moved away from the bowling 
[02:28:00]  center and i didn't really like as a  teenager i'm like oh is that how your  mom got back at your dad i'm moving him  away from the bowling center  well one of a variety of ways um but uh  damn you never had the chance really and  i never really had the chance and now i  feel like i'm not gonna bowl a perfect  game now when was the last time you  bowled i i i bowled once this year i mean  i don't if you had if you bowled today  what do you think you could roll i would  i'd probably average 190 180 190 that's my  dad yeah that's my dad this is my dad did 
[02:28:30]  this uh this is a miller highlife beer  commercial he shot in 1969 oh wow holy  shit there is my dad was 29 there wow yeah  in the first three games he ever bowled  billy scored 79 87 and 69 this is uh are  people he looks like a lot yeah we'll  fill in the blanks we'll fill in the blanks  yeah black and white commercial he's in a  bowling center it's closed down he's  bowling bartenders pouring him a beer he's 
[02:29:00]  about to leave a split all right that's a  six seven and uh he picks it up there it  goes bam wow damn right now that hey that  guy a couple couple great things about  this commercial number one after he did  this commercial they wouldn't let active  athletes do beer commercials anymore  because for some reason they felt it left  a bad example on the kids hey you want to  be a champion drink drink the other thing  was my dad had lines in that commercial  but after so many takes of chugging the  beer he got fucking hammered and uh they 
[02:29:30]  had they were like well no lines for you  so and i saw a couple of people that  were familiar from other commercials of  the era probably so in the background yeah  yeah wow that's cool he had that nice  wicked curve in there a little bit of a  little bit of a hook yeah i like that  does he still bowl no no my dad's funny  he won't pick up he hasn't picked up a  ball in like 25 years really he has this  philosophy where he goes uh the longer i  don't bowl the better i was  people say so he just there's logic in 
[02:30:00]  that yeah yeah he's every 69 he's never  gonna be as good as he was he just got  sick of like fuck it he's had it yeah  can't you just go for fun though like  with the no it's not fun it's not fun for  it's not same reason i can't play chess  anymore jim yeah i can't play chess too  much stress i never played tournament  chess i never never did i always played  for fun but never tournament chess it is a  whole different kind of you know nerd  bullies are hilarious because like a  jock bully will just hit you in the  throat and then that's it but nerd  bullies fuck with your head there were  all these kids and you'd sit down and 
[02:30:30]  they'd go uh are you feeling okay and  then you'd go i'm fine and then am i  feeling it and then they just get in  your head like it's it's a whole  psychological bullying that's uh nerd  nerds like when fisher and spasky played  and he fucking forfeited the first game  you know what a fucking whammy that is  on the world champion when this fucking  psycho from brooklyn doesn't even show  up i think he was from brooklyn right  but uh yeah i can't remember where he  was from new york right now he was in  new york yeah yeah i think absolutely  and and a guy like you know like a  russian guy like boris spasky they can't 
[02:31:00]  wrap their brain around like why would you  not show up yeah he wants decadent he  wants fucking fresh squeezed orange juice  just an asshole jew hater who hated the  soviets he just wheels his balls in on a  cart separately like here we go it's  gonna happen the one thing i'm obsessed  with bobby fisher there's an interview he  did and i don't know i want the rest of  this interview so badly it's a minute  and a half interview on youtube where  he's sitting in a park and he's probably  25 and he's before the championship 
[02:31:30]  and he's talking about how spasky is  scared of him and i just he's so  fucking arrogant really i want the rest  of this interview more than i've ever  wanted an interview before and i can't  find it anymore it isn't a bummer when  the internet lets you down that way and  you're like are you fucking kidding me  internet got everything everything i  can't find that one thing yeah it's  gotta be from the late 60s early 70s  type of porno he was kind of a dennis  rodman before rodman and in chess that's  the oddest thing to have somebody that  like had that kind of personality yeah  in fucking because face it come on it's 
[02:32:00]  chess well yeah because chess is  obviously chess is not a very out it's  not a very outgoing external kind of a  game you're just in your head all the  time so most chess players you can't  really talk to them no you don't talk  smack either or no you don't talk you  just don't talk period just sit there  any kind of human interaction that's  outside the board is very uncomfortable  and sweaty can you can you see the  board in your head i can't do that i  cannot you can do that yeah i have no  ability to envision a board i can see it 
[02:32:30]  now and i can see the pawn moving that's  it i'm done i can't see a head more than  the move i'm making which is probably  wrong that's a that's not good that's a  problem i can't look at like all right  i'll do this he'll do this what that's  beyond the realm of any of my thinking  no way it's they train you to sort of  when you're doing tournament chess to  this is all hilarious talk by the way i'm  sure that i'm sure caroline's gonna sell  right out  yes chess talk with chris hardwick  probably all these all these homeless 
[02:33:00]  chess players  yeah it's just gonna turn out fantastic  uh chess humor yeah fantastic  uh finally a comedian for me  a homeless chess guy  and then and then she goes  castle kingside  two jews walk into a rook  knights take queen oh that's what i said  oh two jews walk into a bar fisher sets the 
[02:33:30]  entrance on fire  oh is he did he lose his fucking mind  yeah holy mackerel  oh not a lot of endorsement opportunities  after that  no  i don't know if there are really a lot of  chess endorsement opportunities in there  i think you know most of the most  professional chess players are russian  and they probably work for the state  and uh they live in a big big house  you know what he called kasparov  weinstein the jew that was his that's  what he called fucking gary kasparov 
[02:34:00]  who i think his mother's name was  weinstein and he would not he would  not call him that russian name he  referred to him as weinstein the jew  and said he cheated that's how he won  what a kook  yeah which also makes that movie  searching for bobby fisher so funny  because it's such a charming movie  and it portrayed bobby fisher as this  like misunderstood outcast he's really  pretty pretty crazy  and it's fucking boy did fisher not  like that movie goes that they  fucking took my name and i didn't get  a fucking dime from that movie oh he's  the greatest he never saw it of course  he's shitting josh wadeskin's face  he hated everything 
[02:34:30]  i wish he was here i really do  just in this room yelling at us  i love i love i love just that  climactic scene in that movie when  that right right when the other kid  he offers him a draw he's like i'm  gonna give you a draw and the kid's  like i'm not gonna take a draw and  the kid goes  you've already lost you just don't  know yeah  yeah great that lisp  this is great  whose dick stayed so off hit to  hearing that  wait was laurence was laurence fish  burn in that movie yeah he played  the uh a homeless guy he was the 
[02:35:00]  home yes he was he was the park  chess player because we were just  talking about the his daughters  oh yeah did you see the video yet  no i'd love to  is it good oh yeah it's good let's  see it oh yeah she probably looks  like him in apocalypse now that's  what you were watching earlier right  guy puts a thing in her thing and  it's no this is oh yeah this is a  nice video right here montana fish  burn oh my god yeah little porn i  can't believe the daughter of the  guy who was on peewee's playhouse i  know cowboy curtis oh my let me see

[02:36:30]  the line here are you serious cool let's  go to princeton alan hey boys good  morning hello say hi to chris hey chris  what's going on hey man how are you so  do you meet bobby fisher i did i  actually when i first came out of  college i was working in a hotel in  philadelphia and uh i'm checking him  out which of course he had this this  black black dyed hair and he says uh  he says uh hey could you give these  this two dollars to that uh that young  negroid boy over there  my jaw went down i said excuse me he's 
[02:37:00]  like the negroid the negroid i'm like  oh okay i'll give it to the to the  negroid so what year is this  that was 99 wow that's when he was  still in fucking he could not be fair  he'd already come out of hiding and he  played spasky again i think in 92 in  yugoslavia okay wait a minute oh what  you wait a minute now oh oh 99 yeah in  the u.s united states bobby fisher in 92 i 
[02:37:30]  believe played spasky and he ripped up  the state department order yes to fucking  not play him and he spit on it on the  news in front of the press i don't  believe he was in the u.s in 99 he was in  the philippines or in hiding i believe  you're wrong  he actually would have been arrested if  he was in the u.s yeah yes because i'm  then there's way the dyed hair i think he  his passport was no good uh but the the 
[02:38:00]  news around bobby fisher being in the  united states in 99 would have been  massive because nobody knew where he  went back into hiding like they talked  about in fucking searching for bobby  fisher came out he played spasky won  three million dollars and left you're  sure it was 99 alan google it yeah i was  right out of college the next day as a  matter of fact uh polanski gave him  three bucks to give to a chink check  that's funny that's funny alan what  hotel was it this was the uh it was in 
[02:38:30]  rittenhouse square uh if you guys know  it was a share in rittenhouse square i  think you're making it where was the  media where was everybody around him  there was nothing i mean there was he  had a handler he had some lady with him  that was probably in her 40s and i didn't  really i mean dude that was 10 11 years  ago so how did you know it was bobby  fisher yeah he signed bobby fisher that  was put in his own name no i did i  think you're making an error or was  another bob fisher jimmy's saying no  way and unless if he got into the  united states how was he not arrested

[02:40:30]  aggressive that's when we were still  playing music on our show yeah you just  nailed it you nailed it i was there like  if you when you would see soundgarden and  early back in the heavy rotation like it  was it was that period of time probably  same time we were at aaf that's what i'm  thinking yeah 95 95 to 98 yeah 95 to 98  right right in the middle of it yep so you  played the the butt trumpets oh yeah yeah  yeah yeah great time the butt trumpet  butt trumpet we could never really play  because you'd have you'd have to bleep like

[02:41:30]  dave douglas cut the whole fucking beginning  of that song off because he didn't like the  the placenta falls to the floor yeah yeah  yeah it's like you cut the whole front of  the song off just started on the next line  it's like why would you do something like  that boy live was a great fucking band they  were i love that band they were huge when i  worked at mtv they just had kind of popped  and uh and i i interviewed them for the  video music awards in 95 uh and they were  they were epic yeah you did a lot for mtv 
[02:42:00]  singled out with jenny mccarthy that's  right that's right you know you don't  regret that do you no no okay it's funny  because i could i was a big hit for you  i've noticed that there has been a  fundamental shift in my career because  people have stopped asking me if i had  sex with jenny mccarthy and now it's  turned into olivia munn yeah yeah that  must mean i've been around for a long  time based on who they've asked me if  i've slept with olivia munn she's great  yeah she's great yep you've never had  her on their show no i think we should  she's cool she's cool you'd like her  so how was ozzy when you interviewed him 
[02:42:30]  he was great we love ozzy ozzy is funny  i didn't know what to expect and i wasn't  sure i mean because you know when you have  people in you don't know if they're gonna  talk right yeah and uh he had wonderful  stories and he was engaging and sweet and  very grateful to a be alive and then b have  a career and uh you know just listen to  him talk about how he was influenced by  the beatles and just like the kind of  music that he wanted to do when he was  growing up he's i loved him how was he  influenced by the beatles that's so  confusing all those british guys  worship him lemmy they all worship the 
[02:43:00]  beatles man all the sabbath all sabbath it  all started with the beatles yep 50  years ago today by the way what  happened uh beatles no yeah no yeah no  swear things get a little ugly here  chris oh guys come on beatles fight  yeah 50 years ago and uh it was kind of  sad they were uh i was listening to i  think it was 10 10 winds or 88 one of  those fucking new york news stations and  they were talking to some kids you know  the kids these days and asking them to 
[02:43:30]  name all the beatles nope they can't do  it finally no finally they can't do it  can they name any of them yeah yeah they  go like paul and john and then they kind  of lose it and so george is where they  all fall off they all just ringo's gonna  outlive them all oh yeah ringo's gonna  outlive them all the proving there's no  god complete iron ironic twist of the  whole thing right yeah ringo go on  ringo will continue i often wonder like  what what lenin would be like now like  if he if he would be kind of sad or if  he'd be like a cool cult hero would he  be like the cool old guy because you 
[02:44:00]  know who's kind of still cool is uh like  neil young even and i know you saw neil  young and he was an asshole playing his  new shit and you know i'm a huge  young fan no matter what but but you  could like sit there and he could still  rock a room with yeah some of his old  shit whatever yeah van morrison has his  dignity yeah he's been around for  fucking ever not many old rockers though  they all look kind of but but if you  said you know you just kind of like yeah  where would john lennon be where he  would just get really bitter because he  was kind of a john lennon seems like 
[02:44:30]  with all of his imagine blah blah blah  he seems like he was kind of a dick  i mean when they ask him if you know  if they ask him if ringo star is the  greatest drummer in the world and he  says he's not even the greatest  drummer in the beatles that's really  shitty that's just a dick move yeah  that's a dick move who said that john  lennon that is fucking it was also 44  years ago that he did the jesus thing  really yeah bigger than jesus bigger  than jesus bigger than jesus that was  44 years ago today wow by the way i got  a text from dr steve oh dr steve 
[02:45:00]  y'all said that uh google says bobby  fisher was in hungary for at least part  of 1999 for at least part part so he  could have been in the united states in  philly he wasn't though  jimmy will not let this go i know for a  fact he wasn't where is he where is he  buried he's buried in uh in rekuvik  iceland he's buried in rekuvik that's  where they finally gave him citizenship  yeah wow when japan fucking didn't know  what to do with him oh he's dead yeah  yeah he died a couple years ago he was 
[02:45:30]  tired he was 66 when he died he was  fucking horrible yeah yeah so he  wouldn't go to the doctor because he's  a fucking he's a brilliant brilliant  interesting guy yeah but they find like  a bishop up his ass wouldn't go to the  doctor because he's afraid of the x-rays  all the chess pieces he put up his  hand  you know you gotta keep it fresh you gotta  keep the game fresh and if that means  yeah that means sitting on a couple  pieces  if you look closely the king didn't  have a cross on the top it was a fist  dude we haven't even talked about web

[02:48:00]  was a we ripped it off  it's just a ripoff it is but it's it's an  authorized ripoff and uh you know it's  just we're just making fun of web videos  how about this what are you digging on the  web lately or making fun of um uh well we're  on hiatus right now um but i mean i mean  where do you even start did you guys  ever see cake farts yeah we love yes  okay we did cake farts live on the show  did you really we're very proud of  ourselves i am very proud of you did you  bring that girl in no we've we did they're  cake fart women all over we got some other

[02:49:00]  easy to get no it's not it's right before  the fucking sherpa if i get that music  channel it's right before the latino  music it's right before like you get  the the sounds of trinidad tobago it's  that high up every time i get there i  like what i see on the damn thing so  g4 is a good a good attack of the  show i work on attack of the show which  is a phenomenally fun nerd uh centric  show my only complaint about g4 is that  sometimes they play movies and i've  never seen worse quality movies like i  like it's it's they play standard 
[02:49:30]  definition movies on the hd channel  right they would look better on  standard definition like they're like  they're stretched out four different  ways and like zoomed in and it's like  pixelated like you could swear that  whoever's programming g4 downloaded  that off a torrent site that's that's  just that's just extra technology i  think i've watched robocop 2 on like  12 pixels on g4 bigger pixels mean more  entertainment there you go you never  want to see an 8-bit robocop why  strain your eyes  so many pixels yeah come on you know 
[02:50:00]  pixels pixels are overrated i just like  a i just like a couple blocks of color  and then i'm good 25 30 feet away you  can almost see faces yeah exactly it's  fine cross your eyes a certain way it's  like it's coming right out now yeah  yeah i picture but besides that g4 is  just terrific  it's just yeah it's a it's a fun it's a  fun nerd channel i like i like working  it reminds me a lot of working at mtv  like years ago because everyone's all  young and they'll let you do whatever 
[02:50:30]  you want and hip and people just  skateboarding down the halls man yeah  like if you know if you want to shoot  a sketch you're like we need a donkey  and a wizard hat they'll fucking get you  a donkey and a wizard hat like there's  no you have no lawyers there's no  enjoy that sir they haven't spent money  on lawyers yet enjoy it for now they'll  bring the lawyers in and you're not  going to be doing anything with donkeys  it'll get corporatized at some point  and then it's like no no donkeys that's  like you can't have that like that the  rules will set in they don't realize  how easy this really is you know those  early mtv days like the spring breaks 
[02:51:00]  and the beach houses like the beach  house expect especially they were never  i always thought before like oh it's  gonna be crazy and you'd go and it was  just like five extras they would cram  into the corner of a pool and just  shoot it really tight be like all right  splash around all right cut everyone  fucking calm down and then that was it  it was it was a very sedate environment  here at the beach house it's a bit  and then yeah five people like maybe  the first year there was a beat there  was a beach house you know they had  the crazy jumping off the roof into  the pool parties and then and then  after that it got all corporate 
[02:51:30]  someone hurt themselves disclaimers had  to be signed yeah that's it then it  was over i did jim brewer's beach  house he had the jim brewer's show  i remember that i preferred comedians  you'd perform on the fucking on the  porch there'd be a bunch of people  just sitting there watching it wasn't  as bad as it sounds yeah but it was  it was pretty bad it was rough because  you're outdoors on a beach on a  porch but i mean because brewer had a  good show yeah it was okay once the  word indemnify comes into any  anywhere it doesn't matter what you're  doing too yeah yeah the fun's over  it's no more fun left lawyers will eat 
[02:52:00]  up fun and just shit out this black  tower where fun used to be  hate it indemnification it's funny that  you did that it's great that you did  that show it's i love that some people  just think like oh comedy you could just  stick that anywhere you're like well  there's a certain you kind of need to  be in a certain setting yeah you know  to kind of make it work back patio of a  beach house it almost looks like it's a  host the most famous little girl in the  world it looks like it's so you know

[02:59:30]  web soup and he does a podcast he does stand up what don't you do chris chess jokes chess  a little bowling i wonder if his father is uh mentioned in stephen lynch's bowling song  oh wow probably not why not you know my dad is he in the hall of fame he said he's in the hall of  fame he is he is someone should go through the bowling song to see if chris's father made it you 
[03:00:00]  never know because uh he uh is a bowling um aficionado you know he really knows everything  about bowling and and got like all the bowlers names into a song why you would want to do that  i don't know my best friend and i wrote a song about the numerical value of pie so who knows why  things happen the way they do that is pretty geeky yeah it's pretty what rhymes with 22 over 7  on july 22nd people on twitter were like it's casual pie day 22 over 7 i'm like that's nerdy for me 
[03:00:30]  really i know that you've never went larping have you i've not i've not larped i've not larped but i  but the chorus of the pie song is just digits of pie and so because of that song i know i i've  memorized like 150 digits of pie it's sick that is bad it's useful for at least it gets you laid  that how far in could you go i could do what three point one four and i'll go with five i think one 
[03:01:00]  three point one four one five how far in could you go really it's pretty far it's uh we pop it up on  the screen i would love to do this as a little exercise for everybody all right all right all  right where's danny four is taking an alcohol shit i think yeah well you gotta get that you  can't sweat it all out yeah did you know it was 3.141 even no i knew 3.14 but after that i'm dead  uh yeah i just i want to see how far he goes before his brain explodes what is pi what exactly is it  pi is the ratio of a circle circumference to its diameter and really it's a it's a mathematical you 
[03:01:30]  only really need a couple of digits maybe six digits of pi to calculate any point in space  and but it's just become this thing of like you know now in japan trillions of digits and  what do you mean to calculate any point in space i don't i don't i can't wrap my head around math  stuff like that which is why it's it's just it's not not p-i-e oh p-i-e don't  so this is why i'm in the other studio listening to the ball and now he's gonna have private  investigators popping up 
[03:02:00]  you really are a dumb chris is looking now don't look okay yeah we want to see how far in you could  go with the pi equals how do you calculate points in space with that well because it will tell you  because you can calculate a point in a circle um then you can plug it into any formula to to to  calculate um spatial relationships why does the number never end why why is it just 3.5  all right it's an irrational number it's it goes on and on why can we round it up a little bit 
[03:02:30]  it's an irrational number it has a vagina that's right all right you guys ready can you see this  there yeah i see it with a big clit if you could go slow because we're really stupid uh let's see  really funny  three seven four one four one five nine two six five three five eight nine seven nine three two three 
[03:03:00]  480-865-1328-230-664-709.  And then it kind of gets a little...  Holy shit.  We couldn't even keep up with the cursor.  Wow.  We lost you somewhere after...  Performing at Caroline's.  Sings pie.  He sings pie.  Dude, come on.  He talks chess.  He sings pie. 
[03:03:30]  That might be the most impressive thing I've ever seen on this show.  You could hear the collective ovaries of New York drying up.  Yeah, but what the fuck, dude?  I know, right?  Wow, man.  You were pretty impressed by that, huh?  That's pretty fucking impressive.  Yes.  I'll give you that.  But I do like the sing-y song you think you haven't done.  You don't think your listeners are like,  go back to the rape stories.  Yeah, what happened?  You kind of made it fun by singing it, though.  So you don't have to do good radio.  We're from Dakota Fanning in a Bikini to Digits of Pie. 
[03:04:00]  A couple of listeners are suggesting we beat you up for being able to do that.  That's fair.  That's fair.  That is fair.  You should sing that on America's Got Talent with, like, Gregory Hines tap shoes.  Jimmy?  Yes, sir.  Remember the Bobby Fischer guy?  I do.  He is back.  And wait till you hear this one.  Okay, go.  He is willing to admit he made a mistake.  Is he?  Oh, good.  I know he did.  I know he did.  Alan in Princeton is back.  Alan.  Good morning, boys.  Hi, Alan.  Oh, Alan.  Oh, Alan.  I want to apologize, and I misspoke. 
[03:04:30]  Yes, you did.  I looked up Eddie Fischer.  Carrie Fischer's father.  Carrie Fischer's father.  He ran into Eddie Fischer.  A little bit different.  Bobby Fischer.  A little bit different of a guy.  What an idiot.  That's funny, man.  Eddie Fischer, the singer.  At least we know who the real racist is.  Yeah, exactly.  Negroids.  Negroids.  How great is that?  Do you know what struck me as odd besides the date was when he said Bobby had dyed hair?  I'm like, Fischer was not an appearance-obsessed guy. 
[03:05:00]  He didn't think a stripy type of guy would dye his hair.  Didn't he kind of look like a Unabomber after a while?  Yeah, because he wouldn't even get fucking metal on his teeth.  He thought it fucked with his head.  He would only sit on certain chairs.  Well, it does, yeah.  When he played Spassky, you know.  That's crazy.  You've got to watch metal in your head.  You do, right?  They plant tracking devices in there.  They do?  It's in the tooth, Bob.  It's in the tooth.  We did it to my dog.  You put the little tracking chip in there.  Oh, yeah?  You're not going anywhere, buddy.  I'm finding you anywhere you go. 
[03:05:30]  I want to see 12 Monkeys again.  12 Monkeys rules.  Michelle in Boston needs the pie song.  Where do they find the pie song?  Oh, it's on iTunes.  I have a comedy band called Hard and Firm with a PH.  So they'll find it, right?  Pie's on there, yeah, yeah.  Do a little search, Michelle.  You'll find it.  We have a very liberal jury.  Let's go to Jamie in Pittsburgh.  Jamie.  Morning, boys.  Hey, we're hanging with Chris Hardwick, man.  I think we've got a new friend to the show, man.  He's cool.  Yeah, he's the best.  I just wondered if Yank Hard was going to get together.  That's hilarious. 
[03:06:00]  Weird Al Yankovic and I made a joke that we were going to do a comedy duo called Yank Hard.  All right, that'll work.  But we have not done that yet.  Did he already hang up?  He just said that one thing and then he hung up.  Yeah, that's what they did.  And he bailed on you.  Yeah.  I like to ask questions.  I don't wait for answers.  Oh, would you like to acquire the knowledge you were recently seeing?  Nope.  Nope.  Just like to posit queries.  You're friends with Weird Al?  Yes.  How did that come about?  We became buddies through Tom Lennon.  He knows Will Wheaton.  Everyone knows Will.  So, you know, Al is a guy that I met, you know, working at MTV in the old days and then 
[03:06:30]  became reacquaintance with through Tom Lennon, just doing shows at the UCB Theater in L.A.  Bobby Fischer looks a lot like Jim Henson.  Yes, he does.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Wow, wee.  Yeah, he looked great.  That's a good call.  He looked great.  What a mess.  Yeah.  Boy, was he mad.  The fucking Jews!  All he wanted to do was yell about them.  This was a post-mortem photo, right?  Yeah, he really does kind of look a little peaked.  This is like that Memento Mori that they used to do in the Victorian times where they  photograph dead people. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, well, what a sick little custom that was.  Well, because no one was ever photographed, and so they felt that it was a way that they  could have their souls live on.  But if you ever want to be creeped out, just look up Memento Mori online.  Let's do it right now.  All right, Memento Mori, M-O-R-I.  The children ones are especially the best ones.  Oh, yeah, the babies where they try to make them all.  Yeah, they try to make them look all cute and baby-like.  Why didn't they photograph them alive?  Because photography was too expensive.  And so it was just, it was brand, photography was a brand new medium.  Wait, that person's dead?  No, the baby is. 
[03:07:30]  The baby's dead.  The baby's dead?  Dead baby.  What'd the kid die of?  Just being a human.  Anything killed you back then?  Back then?  What are you kidding?  Oh, there's some dust in the air.  Half the population's wiped out.  Dead.  Give me a ghoulish one.  How much were pictures back then?  I don't know.  But typically, it was, you know, because most people, before that point, wealthy people would  have portraits painted.  And so photography came along, and it was relatively expensive at first, but it quickly became inexpensive.  It was an inexpensive way for people to be represented, because they couldn't afford. 
[03:08:00]  You think they would have been weirded out by an iPad back then?  Yeah, I always wondered that, like, if you could drag someone in time and go, here's  where we are now, if they could even wrap their mind around it, they'd be like, we're  back, fiend.  They'd probably break it with a rock and burn you alive.  Witch!  You're just seeing a plane in the sky has got to be.  I always thought how odd it would be for Orville or Wilbur Wright to sit in the seat  of, you know, an Airbus and just look out the window and go like, yeah, because it 
[03:08:30]  was such a hassle to just fly that stupid Wright Flyer.  And just to sit there, and you're having a drink, and you're in a comfy seat, and just  looking out the window.  We got our plane off the ground for 13 minutes.  Yeah, like a foot.  Big fucking deal.  See you in New York.  Just rub it in that.  See you in New York.  Yeah, just rub it in that you made his idea way better.  Yeah.  Oh, that's pretty morbid right there.  Yeah, I guess they did it with the kids, mostly.  They loved the babies.  Reminds me of a great scene in, uh... 
[03:09:00]  Dead!  Dead!  Dead!  God, that's creepy.  The sunken eyes and gaunt face make the post-mortem below haunting.  The profile view is unique to our collection.  Oh.  Look at him.  He looks like, uh...  Hang on, guys.  I just gotta crank this one out really fast.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, shit, yeah.  Don't scroll.  Yes, leave that little coffin there.  Look at that baby in a baby coffin.  Moments before being placed in the earth.  What were they thinking?  Well, for them, it was just a way to let them live on. 
[03:09:30]  Like, it was, uh...  Yeah.  Yeah.  They pose like the mother and father are holding the dead baby.  Why don't they do one while the kid was alive?  Fucking assholes.  It's not interesting when they're alive.  Then they're in your face all the time.  Here, it's like, eh.  And you had to stay still when they took pictures back then, and there's no way you could stay  still that long if you were a baby.  That was...  Exactly.  You know?  That was like Victorian Kmart.  They had to take those pictures.  Memento Mori.  Bring your dead baby.  Bring your dead baby.  Dead baby glamour shots. 
[03:10:00]  All these people are dead?  Yeah.  Okay, now we're...  All right, all right.  No, no, no.  All right, we got some people calling in.  Jeff in Cleveland.  Jeff.  Hey, yeah.  Great show, guys.  Hey, uh...  We know that.  Yeah, get used to it.  Actually, don't.  Hey.  What?  I want to know about Adam Sessler.  Does he have a deal with the devil?  I mean, that guy's been on since you guys were...  ZDTV.  Ah, yeah.  You know, there's a couple people that have been around a long time.  Even since Tech TV. 
[03:10:30]  Morgan's been around since then.  And Kevin Pereira's actually been there.  Kevin Pereira was like an intern.  Wow.  And they just kind of stuck him on screensavers, and then it became Attack of the Show.  Yeah, Adam's been there a while.  He's the...  He might be the head vampire.  He might be the head vampire.  I like him.  I like you guys.  Don't change anything.  Don't get right at him, just because he kind of looks like Chris Loder now.  Well, I don't have that power, but I appreciate your accrediting me with the ability to get  rid of people.  Yeah.  You're like hiring and firing.  Sessler, it's Hardwick. 
[03:11:00]  Wow.  Jim Henson.  That is amazing.  Nailed it, Chris Hardwick.  Yeah, they're pretty similar.  That is amazing.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Chris in Delaware.  Chris.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  This is a bit out of context at this point.  Who cares?  But I hope you got it yet.  You haven't seen it yet, but it's fastforwardblowjobs.com.  I've seen fastforwardblowjobs.com.  Have you, Chris Hardwick?  No.  It's more morning fare.  It's some terrific morning fare.  This is hilarious.  A little 2X6? 
[03:11:30]  It's very funny.  Oh, my Lord.  That's not okay.  Can you put this on WebSoup, please?  Yeah.  We can put this on WebSoup.  Yep.  I'm just saying it weirdly satisfies two fetishes.  The chipmunk fetish and the hyperspeed blowjob fetish.  Alvin!  Swallow that cum!  Wow. 
[03:12:00]  What the fuck?  It's hilarious.  Who thought this would be funny?  Because they were right.  Regular blowjobs are fine, but what would it be like in a time warp?  This is how a blowjob would be as you approach the black hole.  They're cumming like two rivers.  Meet you cock and mouth.  Yeah, these porn stars age like dogs, like one year for every seven, so why would you 
[03:12:30]  want to take any more time away from them?  You can actually see them aging in this.  You can see them aging.  That's a fast one.  That's great.  I got very good news for you, Chris.  Sean in Georgia?  Hey, guys.  I think Chris's dad is mentioned in Stephen Lynch's song.  Bowling song?  Did we get to the bottom of that?  That's amazing.  I was halfway through when I came in here.  Oh, really?  What happened to Danny?  Check out Oscar. 
[03:13:00]  He's having some trouble.  He's having some ass problems.  That's pretty awesome.  I would love to know that my dad made it into the...  We could play Josie on the show.  Yeah, we will.  Yeah, we'll have to do that for you.  Because I grew up with most of those.  I'm sure I grew up with everyone who's in that song.  You'll probably know every baller in there.  Yeah.  No.  No.  Is it Malakai in there?  Isn't that his made-up guy's name or something?  Maybe that's the made-up guy.  I was named after the commentator, Chris Schenkel.  No shit!  Yeah.  He did the bowling fucking commentary.  Because my mom thought I was going to be a girl. 
[03:13:30]  Who's got a dick now, Mom?  And so she thought I was going to be a girl.  And so Chris Schenkel said, oh, if it's a boy, name him Christopher.  And she was like, okay, sure.  And then I ended up being a boy.  And so I ended up being a Christopher.  There's one for the old-timers out there.  Chris Schenkel.  Chris Schenkel.  He did bowling.  Wide world of sports.  He did, yeah, wide world of sports.  His sport was, I think, bowling.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm trying to think what other ones he was a commentary for.  I don't remember.  I've watched on ESPN Classics some of the old wide world of sports. 
[03:14:00]  And it's amazing what was considered sports back then.  There was a stadium.  I think it was, like, in Los Angeles.  It was full of people, fucking packed, for dog frisbee.  Yeah, but...  Yeah, just...  Barrel jumping.  Yeah, but to be fair, we have, like, chariot racing.  And, you know, there's all sorts of...  There's all sorts of...  There's all sorts of silliness now.  But when you look at athletes back then, they were kind of doughy and built, like, fucking... 
[03:14:30]  Oh, yeah.  Barrels.  Like, sheds.  And now just dudes are ripped.  Yeah, yeah.  No one was cut.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah, had abs.  It was just these barrel-chested guys.  Remember before steroids, when guys got strong, just, like, picking up kegs and cars and shit?  Like those fucking strongman competitions on ESPN?  I love the old strongman competitions.  They're great.  Yeah, toss these cement-filled barrels.  Drag this truck with your teeth.  Try not to shit your pants.  No safety wasn't even taken into consideration.  No, no, no, no. 
[03:15:00]  Brian Regan's bid on that is great.  Oh, where he's watching the guy throw pianos into a second-story window.  I was like, they don't have to be there.  You're right.  What are you doing?  Right.  Put that down.  That is a great Brian Regan.  Oh, Brian is fantastic.  Brian Regan rolls.  I had a Brian Regan woman this morning at the hotel, where a woman working at the hotel  said, have a great stay.  And I was like, you too!  You too!  Have a great stay at that thing you said.  If you're going to be staying at a place like I'm staying.  And a portable generator for camping, hunting boats. 
[03:15:30]  This isn't the original one, though.  No?  Spanning the globe.  That's Chip McKay, right?  Yeah.  Definitely Chip McKay.  The thriller victory.  Uh-oh.  The agony of defeat.  And then, of course.  I love the best part.  This idiot.  This jerk.  And the agony of defeat.  That was YouTube before YouTube.  Yeah, yeah.  The agony of defeat guy.  The human drama of athletic competition.  He was viral.  Bobby Fischer.  Bobby Fischer!  Visual, sorry.  This is ABC.  Oh, that's a normal one. 
[03:16:00]  Sucker!  Still boring, even back then!  God, I used to watch this.  It's amazing how this show would just...  No one would watch this now.  At all.  I know.  No, it would be a rough one to sell to the networks.  Dude, everyone watched this.  Dude, do you remember this week in baseball?  Before the fucking...  You had to watch that to see what the other teams were doing.  Mel Allen?  You'd have to wait a whole week.  Mel Allen.  To see what everyone else was doing.  I was having a conversation with someone the other day.  We were talking about the old Dr. Demento show.  I love Dr. Demento.  And so it came on on Sunday nights in Memphis.  And I think it's funny that there was a period of time where there was appointment radio. 
[03:16:30]  Where, like, if you didn't listen to Dr. Demento on Sunday nights, it was gone forever.  You missed it ever.  It was gone.  Never to be heard.  You had to be in front of a radio to consume your entertainment.  Appointment radio.  We used to trade the cassettes of Dr. Demento.  Yes!  What do you got?  Well, I got this.  I forgot all the fucking songs that we used to love.  Wow.  We would trade that shit.  My Bologna.  Right.  I forgot.  Dead puppies.  Kinko the Clown.  Yeah, you remember. 
[03:17:00]  Instead of Sharona?  Yeah.  Of course.  Yeah.  It was really weird.  Jimmy's teeth hurt.  Yeah.  Fucking makes my gums itch.  Horrendous.  I wish people could see the face you were making.  It just looks like you swallowed a bad plum or something.  You want to hear My Bologna?  I'm sure we got My Bologna.  No, I'm sure it's all My Bologna.  I like to eat it like...  That's exactly what it is.  You nailed it.  It's terrible.  It was Weird Al's first song when he was at Caltech.  Tell us something about Weird Al we don't know.  Weird Al has a Segway in his house, and the first time you go to his house, he makes you 
[03:17:30]  do a lap on the Segway.  On a Segway.  What's a Segway?  Like the Segway.  The cart, yeah.  He's rich, isn't he?  Yeah, of course.  Well, yeah.  And he's also...  He did Eat It.  He's the nicest guy in the world.  Love Weird Al.  I touched his Eat It Grammy when he was out of the room.  Damn.  I'm going to touch the Eat It Grammy.  What was the Grammy for?  Best Comedy Recording or something?  It was...  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sure it was.  Eat It fucking did very well.  Destroyed.  Yeah, it did very well.  Was that a Dr. Demento song?  No.  It got...  I mean, he played it.  Wait, Dirty Deeds Done With Sheep? 
[03:18:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I don't remember that one.  Yeah.  That's all Dr. Demento shit.  Could we hear a little of this guaranteed laugh getter?  Everyone's got to start somewhere, Jimmy.  Oh, wait.  Was this Al Yagovic?  I was a fan of the really weird songs that weren't parodies that were on Dr. Demento.  Yeah, Kinko the Clown.  There was a band called Ogden Edsel.  And Kinko the Clown and Dead Puppies.  Like, those weird...  Fish heads.  Fish heads.  Barnes and Barnes. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, that was...  That was Bill Mooney.  I know.  We learned that only recently, too.  Oh, really?  No, I knew that.  Did you know?  Don't lump me in the category of not knowing what...  I never seen drink cappuccino in Italian restaurants with Ori and the women.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a...  I know my Bill Mooney trivia.  What do you want to hear, Jimmy?  You want to hear my bologna today?  Yes, I do.  Do you?  Yeah.  We like Weird Al, Chris.  I know your friends.  He's a good guy.  I'm sure he is.  We'll have to have him on the show now.  Yeah, I'm sure we'd love to have him on and do some songs.  Jimmy!  He hates Weird Al. 
[03:19:00]  Jim couldn't even finish that sentence.  I don't hate him.  Not your cup of tea.  John Valby, to me, is the song parody guy.  John Valby rules.  Of course.  Tom Lehrer is the guy.  But fucking Valby's a jerk.  He wouldn't do any of our shows.  He would rather do an 80-seat fucking venue than nowhere.  Valby's a kook.  He's not a jerk.  He's a kook.  He's a kook.  He'd appreciate that I called him a jerk, though.  Archival.  Hey, Lottie, Lottie, Lottie.  I mean, Tom Lehrer is a guy who was writing pot songs in the 1940s. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah?  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I thought I really liked the Jaws song.  I don't do that.  What was the Jaws song?  No, that's the Dickie Goodman shit.  Dickie Goodman.  I was never a fan of the Dickie Goodman shit.  Dickie Goodman stunk.  Glad he's dead.  He shot himself.  Should have done it a lot earlier.  Is my bologna going to play, or is it...  Yeah, what is this?  I was waiting for you guys.  Oh, we're ready.  We're ready.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  I remember this.  I hate to admit, I remember this. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, my little hungry one.  Hungry one.  Open up a package of my bologna.  Jimmy, okay?  I know the story behind this video.  Yeah, me too.  Who wants to start?  Jimmy?  I was at Caltech, and this was before people were really making a lot of music videos. 
[03:20:30]  And this guy's like, I want to do an experimental thing.  And so they shot this video.  It's only two camera angles.  Wow.  There you go.  There you go.  Weird Al with his accordion.  That's an accordion.  What do we know?  He's a multi-millionaire.  And Jimmy, just grimacing.  That's not my thing.  But, you know, again, the guy's a massively successful artist.  There's no one else. 
[03:21:00]  Like, there's no other parody guy, really.  It's Weird Al.  That's pretty much it.  He was the only guy.  He was the main parody guy for a long fucking time.  And talk about having giant budget videos after a while.  He got, like, videos that had big sets and a lot of people.  Well, all of the music industry would spend millions of dollars on videos.  Yeah.  After Michael Jackson and John Landis broke the million-dollar thriller,  like, after that, it was like, oh, now everyone's going to make a million-dollar video.  Yeah, yeah.  That don't happen so much no more.  No.  They kind of pulled back. 
[03:21:30]  Someone's going to turn us on to a parody song here today.  Brian in Philly.  Brian.  Hey, good morning, Opie, Anthony, Jimmy.  Hello.  There's two statements from the Dr. D'Ametto show that I always enjoyed growing up.  One was, it was The Ballad of Irving, the 142nd fastest gun in the West.  I don't remember who sings it, though.  And the other one was by former wrestler Fred Blassie, the pencil-neck geek.  Yeah, that was a big Dr. D'Ametto song.  Pac-Man Fever was a big song.  Pac-Man Fever. 
[03:22:00]  Remember the Curly Shuffle?  Yes.  Yes, of course.  The Curly Shuffle.  That was the Jump in the Saddle Gang.  Do you remember?  And then, of course, oh, no.  Oh, God.  The Duke.  That was so bad.  I don't have it in front of me right at this moment, unfortunately.  I get such chills.  I can't believe it.  I don't want to make everyone feel bad, but you know this is what old people sit around  and do.  I know.  What are you going to do?  And remember, there was a flugelhorn player who... 
[03:22:30]  You know what, fucker?  Now I'm going to play it for you.  It's terrible.  What the fuck is it?  I can't take that song.  I was at a diner in the middle of Hollywood once, and there was a table full of character  actors like Chuck McCann and all these character actors that you would recognize from the 60s,  70s, 80s.  And I was listening to them shit on the young alternative comics like Janine.  And it was crazy where they were like, those they don't know about joke writing.  It was the funniest. 
[03:23:00]  As a comic, it was really funny.  I mean, they're talking about all these people that I love, but they were just kind of like  old, like the old generation shitting on the young generation.  They'll never understand how...  It's a lost art.  Right, right, right.  Da-ha.  Da-ha.  Ah.  Da-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  It's better than Disco Duck.  You got off easy.  That song is brutal.  It's brutal, but it's better than Disco Duck.  What is it, really?  Disco Duck.  You could say that about fucking SIDS.  Disco Duck. 
[03:23:30]  My favorite clip of Disco Duck is in Saturday Night Fever, when the dance instructor guy  is teaching the old people how to disco, to Disco Duck.  And he's talking about how, hey, Tony, I'm holding steady at 75%.  There was some...  The movie Blind Date, with Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger, came on the other night, and  there's like some Rick Dees comedy song in there, too.  Like, it's Rick Dees, and here's a...  Here's a bit of comedy, though.  Horrible. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  Is this disco?  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Sing it, Rick.  Boy, wouldn't it have been great to have been working a radio in the 70s?  Ah, how easy.  Be a boss jock.  Ah.  A super jock like Wolfman Jack.  That's it.  100,000 watts coming out of Mexico.  What a genius, right?  Just fucking baking the whole...  The microwaving animals near the fucking stick. 
[03:24:30]  Duh-huh.  That's horrible.  Stupid Disco Duck.  Yeah.  That was played like...  Oh, my God, was that played like a motherfucker.  I remember getting into the car with Mommy, driving to Grandma's house, and that thing  would just be fucking wailing.  Oh, with Disco Duck?  Yes.  It was played all the time.  What a great time for entertainers.  I mean, like, you know, I always think now is a great time for young entertainers because,  you know, you can...  People can get their shit out in the world the way that they never could before.  But back then, if you hit it, you fucking hit it because there were only three channels. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, there was really nowhere else to go.  And people were probably going to see you because everyone had to watch those three  channels.  And now it's just like, you know...  It's like, oh, yeah, the fucking JetBlue guy.  He's famous.  You could do stand-up on a talk show like 100 times and it, you know, still, it doesn't  really register.  It doesn't matter.  No one cares anymore.  It's like, oh, really?  Honestly, I have fucking three million hits on my YouTube video.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:25:30]  Now it's...  You get edged out by the baby that gets bitten by a duck video or whatever.  You're right.  That's the...  By Charlie bit me.  Fucking right, man.  By Charlie bit me.  Charlie.  Oh, Charlie.  Charlie.  Out.  That is hysterical.  That's very cute.  I don't know why.  I don't know why that is so fucking funny.  Because he's scolding the baby like an adult.  First of all, the accent's cute.  The accent's adorable.  That hurt.  Yeah.  But it's no double rainbow.  Oh. 
[03:26:00]  Double rainbow.  My girlfriend explained double rainbow to me the first before I saw it.  I was like, that sounds like the dumbest thing in the history of humanity.  And then the minute he opened his mouth and I heard, full rainbow.  I was like...  I was just like the entire time.  That drinking out of cups is just hysterical.  Drinking out of cups.  The big one now is the ice cream truck guy, though.  You've seen...  Oh, the guy that got hit by the ice cream truck is good, but...  You've seen that one, right, Chris?  No.  Can you pull it up?  Oh, and we interviewed the guy. 
[03:26:30]  We got the big exclusive interview.  Oh, yeah.  The exclusive.  It's already popping three million views or something like that.  Jeez.  Here we go.  What a guy.  Yeah, this guy is...  See, if you were doing web soup, you would be all over this one.  I know.  We're on hiatus right now.  Yeah, this guy.  And he turned out to be a really cool guy.  He called our show.  He survived what you're about to see.  We don't know why he's walking into an intersection and then dancing in the street. 
[03:27:00]  Well...  Well, okay.  Well...  He just starts doing this backwards dance.  Yeah, yeah.  He's not really looking.  At all.  He said he looked.  There's no crosswalk.  He didn't see anything coming.  Well, clearly he's trying to make a...  He's trying to make a kooky video.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then he, like...  He's playing the ice cream truck.  Oh, damn, did he get nailed.  That was the sound of a human being.  You know, like...  More morning fare for you.  When people get hit by machines, it's not like in the movies where it goes... 
[03:27:30]  Like, no, it's like a sack of meat.  Yeah, it is really a loud...  Getting slammed against the wall.  It's an uncomfortable sound to hear.  The walk.  Yeah.  He's fine.  They'll broke ribs.  This and that.  I feel like one of those sound effects CDs.  African American being hit by an ice cream truck.  Like, it's a very specific sound.  I can think of a better title for that, though.  A little shorter.  A little shorter.  Since Eddie Fisher used Negroid, I felt that that was racist. 
[03:28:00]  Andy in Cleveland's got one.  Andy.  Hey, going back with a classic internet audio bit, Donald Duck gets a blowjob.  You know what?  There was a time we played that on our radio show.  Oh, yeah.  Have you ever heard this one?  Yes.  I think it was...  I think a radio guy out of St. Louis came up with it,  and it became fucking huge.  We have that?  Let me see if we got this.  Donald Duck gets a blowjob.  455,000 views.  It's everywhere.  The internet's got everything. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, my God.  I feel so good.  Oh, yeah.  I'll slow down.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Who's your daddy?  Who's your daddy?  You need to put this on a fast forward blowjobs.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  There's my mouth.  Who's clapping in the background?  Oh, I feel so good.  Yeah, just roll them around.  And you're sure it's like, oh, my God.  I love it with you.  Uh-oh, slow it up.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:29:00]  Don't move.  I'll go get you a towel.  Now, since he was probably the first guy to do that.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You got to give him some props for that.  Fuck, dude.  Half a million views, just about.  And it's not even a video.  Half a million.  A little audio thing for everybody.  Of course, I just saw Darth Vader gets a blowjob.  Everyone gets a blowjob.  Yeah.  I have a three million hit video.  God damn.  That's something. 
[03:29:30]  What's that one?  That was my famous...  Horse gag.  Horse gag, yeah.  Tub girl, see?  Yeah, that's the...  Famous install Vista in two minutes.  That was a while ago.  This is Windows Vista.  It's almost four million.  This is an operating system for Microsoft.  Wow.  Come on, guys.  Let's push it over the top.  Four million.  Four million.  Come on.  Do it today.  And you would think with the disk and everything, I would have been able to do that.  But I popped it in my machine, and it seems to be incompatible with everything I have in 
[03:30:00]  my computer.  Are you trying to say it?  This got everybody on the Mac Vista fight thing.  So I was able to get a lot of hits because people were calling me a fanboy and trying to  analyze the video to see what was on the shelf there to see if Mac stuff was up there.  I get so much shit on G4 from fans who, when I talk about Apple, they're like,  you're sucking Steve Jobs' cock.  And I'm like, what do you think I get out of this? 
[03:30:30]  I like stuff that I like.  Apple doesn't give anything to anybody.  I just like stuff that I like.  Yeah, whatever you like, you like.  That's just it.  But there's a great article on fanboyism, and it just talks about how when you say you  like Apple, what you're really doing is attacking a core belief system of someone  who's a PC person, and they take it as a personal attack.  And so they have to tell you what a piece of shit you are.  I have both. 
[03:31:00]  I think you kind of need both in this day and age.  I got Windows.  Or all three.  Linux.  Yeah, yeah, right?  I need 16 different operating systems in my house.  Please.  Because there are certain things that just run better on Windows and others that run  better on Mac.  Yeah.  Yeah, like, you know, if you run music software, editing software, you know, like Mac's the  way to go.  There was no good software for a PC that was comparable to my PC.  And for gaming, especially years ago, it was all of it.  You walked into a store. 
[03:31:30]  Now you can't find anything for computers.  It's all console gaming.  But when I was walking into a store, you know, years ago, there'd be this little section  from Mac, and it's like, oh, great.  Oh, that tiny little software section.  There's no games available.  And then just Windows.  A notes-taking program.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  Yeah, if you want a good PC game system, then you have to go Alienware, though, is the  good PC game system.  They have insane stuff.  Yep.  We forgot to do the Highway comic.  You say you teased it, didn't tell us. 
[03:32:00]  And we've got some comics in studio.  We've got Chris Hardwick playing Carolines all weekend long, and of course, a little  Jimmy Norton.  It's a guy selling jokes to make your day better.  Okay.  Do you want to check this out?  I do.  Yes.  It's the Highway comic, everyone.  Guy bugs me his name.  People are doing what they can to make ends meet, and for one man, that means spending  his free time on the highway, making people smile.  My wife calls me her little lava lamp.  Okay.  Interesting to watch, but not very bright. 
[03:32:30]  All right, that's Dan.  And what's happened is, the guy hands you a, he has a bucket of shit and a ladle, and  you can fling it on him.  That reminds me of something that Mel Brooks said once.  Wit is shit.  Funny is money.  All right, that's Dan Heppner.  He's a stand-up comedian, and he sells jokes to passerbys for 50 cents apiece.  He got the idea after the local comedy club there shut down. 
[03:33:00]  He says he has about 90 jokes ready to go to make people laugh with as much money as  they have.  Heppner estimates that he makes about 20 bucks an hour in his new gig.  Pretty cool.  Hey, darling.  I gave my wife a milk bath for her birthday.  The cow sat on her.  That was worth 50 cents?  Wow.  He's good.  I love how the news guy goes, pretty cool, huh?  Pretty cool.  Trying to sell it.  All right.  We're doing some special interest stories now. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  I'm really branching out.  Right.  Pretty cool.  I know how to live.  He's panhandling, is what I say.  He's basically panhandling.  He's on the side of the road.  He's got a bucket, and people have their windows rolled down.  He tells a joke, and they give him money.  He reminds me of the taxi driver that Jimmy brought in one day.  Oh, God.  The positive cabbie.  His name is the positive cabbie.  He has all red, white, and blue.  He's got a flag tie.  And what does he do?  He gives you a card as soon as you get in the cab?  Yeah, he's a horse's ass. 
[03:34:00]  He gives you a card, and he rambles about how he's the courteous cabbie, and it's fucking  penance.  Yeah, it's all just positive.  Welcome to the Soup Kitchen Cabity Club.  There's a two-soup minimum.  Yeah.  Let's go to Mike in Hoboken.  Mike.  Hey, boys.  What's up?  There's a video clip out there right now called Darth Schwarzenegger, where they take a Star  Wars clip, and they just remove James Earl's bones, and they threw Arnold Schwarzenegger  in there, and it fits perfect.  You guys might enjoy it.  Why would it?  Are you kidding me? 
[03:34:30]  Anything with Arnold in it.  Come on.  Yeah, Arnold's...  I know Arnold's passe.  Passe?  My listeners suck.  All right, we're going to try it.  My listeners suck.  All right, you know what?  Who are we?  We're going to try it.  Right now, we're going to try it.  Darth Schwarzenegger.  Knock, knock.  I knew this man.  Oh, it's real clips.  Green Berets out of Fort Bragg.  Now, what the hell were they doing here? 
[03:35:00]  All right.  I mean, it stinks.  It stinks.  First of all, it's not enough.  There's just music.  It's not interesting or funny.  Oh, here we go.  Excuse me.  I have a few more questions, if you don't mind.  Oh.  You mean he did not have sexual relations with him?  Hmm?  Answer the question.  We intercepted no transmissions.  This is a consular ship.  We're on a diplomatic mission. 
[03:35:30]  You're a fucking quiet boy compared to me.  I'm quiet boy.  That's not...  That's all right.  That's all right.  I take it back.  He's dead already.  See?  Clear the area.  No traces.  Get the main razor to move.  All right.  It's done well.  Not bad.  It's done well.  It's Arnold's...  Yeah, it's real Arnold's.  I thought it was somebody doing a fat Arnold impression.  What a shock.  I was being a reactionary jerk-off.  Good guess.  Put my fucking foot in my mouth.  The Imperial Senate will not steal from this. 
[03:36:00]  When they hear you've attacked a diplomat...  We want to know the most intimate details about your life.  You better tell us.  Can you sleep with him?  Hmm?  So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us in a meat crater.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.  You're a damaged goods lady.  Fuck you.  It got way better.  Let's just start off slow.  It starts off a little slow.  Fuck you. 
[03:36:30]  It could generate sympathy for the rebellion in the Senate.  I don't know what the crazy bitches are.  He's my governor.  She'll die before she'll tell you anything.  It's still weird, by the way.  I just want you guys to know.  It's got to be.  It's still weird.  It's got to be whenever you watch a movie.  It's like, oh my God, that's our governor.  A little strange.  That's okay.  We got fucking Governor cockeyed.  Over here in New York.  It's great.  He signs a bill.  He puts his nose on the paper.  He can't see.  Oh, really?  I can't see.  God damn it.  Are you guys going to see the Expendables this weekend? 
[03:37:00]  Yeah, I think it's going to be huge.  I bet it's going to be like, I bet it's going to make a lot of money.  I can't even imagine.  Is there anything?  What was the budget of that movie?  Like, it's better.  I can't imagine that it's going to be.  That's how our governor looked.  Hey.  Oh.  Governor.  Governor, where am I?  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  Oh, that's what I said.  Is that Armisen doing it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He does it.  Show the sign of him signing.  How great is that?  That's how he signs the bill.  That's how he signs bills. 
[03:37:30]  Oh, no.  Just get fucking glasses.  It looks like Tony Montana at the end of Starface.  Got to get organized.  Hangs up the phone.  Organized.  50 guys with machine guns.  Got to get organized.  Hangs up the phone and he straightens the coal pile.  That's what he's organizing.  Yeah, wow.  Talk about spring cleaning.  His sister's body, he pushes to the side.  Why would they let him drive a Segway?  It seems safe.  He was over.  Well, forget about it.  Oh, okay.  That's not him.  Okay, no.  That's another guy.  Yeah.  That's another guy. 
[03:38:00]  Garbage day.  Everyone's suggesting viral videos now.  I'm sure you don't want to talk about viral videos.  Oh, I'll talk about whatever you want.  That's his job, for God's sake.  Really?  I don't mind.  It's like your dad not wanting to bowl anymore.  No, it's fine.  By the way, your dad's not in the bowling zone.  God damn it!  Sorry, Chris.  Fuck you, Stephen Lynch!  I'll take it up with Mr. Lynch.  How is it not in there?  Hey, did you hear about the iPhone having problems with the antenna?  Yeah, I maybe heard a thing or two about that.  Guy who's eight years late with all tech news. 
[03:38:30]  Let's get going here.  We got some plugs to get to.  Yes.  Wow.  Chris has 1.3 million followers on Twitter.  Nerdist, if you want to start following him.  Yeah.  And his comedy will be at Caroline's starting tonight, tonight through Sunday, 212-757-4100.  Oh, my God, please come to the show.  God damn it, please.  Yes.  Oh, wait.  Was I too desperate?  Nah, you're going to do just fine.  Fuck it.  That's how I feel in every city I go to.  Please show up on my show.  Yeah. 
[03:39:00]  You know, comedy is the simplest formula in the world.  If people show up, you can perform.  But it is one of the fucking hardest formulas in the world to achieve.  And then you make excuses, Jimmy, when it's a little light out there.  No, yeah.  You're like, ah, you know, there must be something going on in town.  And the staff is humiliated for you on some level.  And they're cutting waitresses on the Saturday Late Show.  They're like, yeah, you know, there's that festival in town in two weeks.  People don't have money.  It's the economy.  Oh, Jim, plague outbreak.  There was a little plague.  Just a little plague wiped out three quarters of the population. 
[03:39:30]  So I'm sorry.  So who was here last week?  Bruce Bruce.  We added a Sunday show.  That's great.  And a matinee.  And a matinee.  Who was here?  Well, the hypnotist sold out eight straight.  Yeah.  He's a ventriloquist hypnotist.  He's great.  Is that true?  I would have gotten news on that.  Feedback says WebSoup covered my karaoke video.  I don't think WebSoup did.  It was another...  Your phone's upside down.  Yeah, I know.  I look at my crack.  Oh, no!  Yeah.  It gives it personality.  That's the problem. 
[03:40:00]  Now it has a little asshole on it.  Yeah, it does.  A little fucker.  And one holding it.  The set up and the spike.  Nice.  Oh, God.  Well, Chris, this was a pleasure, man.  It was so nice to finally come on your show.  Absolutely.  And see you guys.  And a nice shot.  And get to talk.  Are you performing this?  Are you performing anything?  I'm in town for a while.  And then I go back out to Charlie Goodnight to North Carolina.  And I forget where else.  I'm glad this favor worked out for everybody.  Because we were told to take you as a favor. 
[03:40:30]  I'm like, I think he'll just fit in.  That's nice.  And then we joked about it before he got here that we're bringing you in as a favor.  No one wants to hear they're a favor.  Did my mom get me on the show?  This is Chris's mom, you guys.  Please, for me.  Trust me.  We knew it would be great for us to have you on the show, Chris.  Well, it was a pleasure to be here, gentlemen.  Yeah, absolutely.  Chris Hardwick, make sure you see him at Caroline's.  Tonight through Sunday.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-100.  I think that's it for us today. 
[03:41:00]  Yes, it is.  Chris, thank you.  Good day.  Thank you.  Good job, man.  Thanks. </pre>
