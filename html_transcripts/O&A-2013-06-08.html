<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Sam Roberts hosting a "Worst of the Week" segment.  This featured several in-studio guests: Jim Brewer, who graphically detailed a disturbing massage experience involving unwanted touching at a bed and breakfast; Ethan Hawke, promoting "The Purge," engaging in humorous banter with the hosts about the film's premise; Rob Delaney, discussing his provocative new board game based on his tweets, leading to a conversation about circumcision;  Dwight Gooden, whose interview, alongside David Lee Roth, covered his struggles with addiction, baseball career, prison time, and frank discussions of drug use; and brief mentions of Crispin Glover and Kevin Smith.

Following this, a former athlete (unnamed in this excerpt) was interviewed. He discussed his career, struggles with substance abuse, and prison time. He reflected on his career achievements, the pressures he faced, and how prison provided perspective and self-acceptance.  His prison experience involved solitary confinement, with activities like walking and playing horseshoes. The conversation transitioned to a discussion of the "Man of Steel" movie trailer, Lois Lane's performance, and a humorous promotion for "How Does He Shave.com," with the athlete contributing his own Superman shaving theory.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to Crispin Glover, who discussed his experience on "Back to the Future," including his lawsuit against Robert Zemeckis, disagreements over the film's ending, and his critique of its pro-capitalist message. Glover contrasted the film's portrayal of money with his belief in the importance of love,  alleging that Bob Gale had misrepresented events in a previous Opie and Anthony appearance. He further criticized Steven Spielberg's films, labeling them as pro-war propaganda.  This was followed by a heated debate between Anthony Cumia and Jim Brewer about gun control, referencing the Boston Marathon bombing and differing views on government overreach.  The segment concluded with advertisement reads.

A subsequent segment featured a strong, often offensive debate on the feasibility of an armed civilian population resisting a tyrannical government.  Participants argued opposing viewpoints, using hypothetical scenarios including Waco and the Boston Marathon bombing as examples.  This was followed by an in-studio appearance by Diamond David Lee Roth.  The interview with Roth covered anecdotes from his career with Van Halen, his creative process, unique performance style, a recent short film he produced in Japan, his personal life, and views on the music industry and acting.  The segment included playing Roth's first record, "Monkey Time," interspersed with casual and vulgar banter between Roth and the hosts and several advertisements.

One of the hosts then discussed his upcoming move out of New York City, detailing his frustrations with city life and contrasting them with the calmer atmosphere of his Brooklyn residence and his anticipated move to suburban Jersey. He vividly described negative Manhattan experiences and positive Brooklyn ones, using copious expletives.  The conversation touched upon his stand-up comedy, a recent performance following John Mulaney, his new phone and case, a planned "Tech Talk" segment, potential titles for his comedy special, a recent visit to his parents, and the differences between suburban and city life, all interspersed with promotional material.

The show concluded with advertisements for Dollar Shave Club, Smart Mouth mouthwash (with a Chuck Woolery appearance), and a Richard Pryor Radio event on Sirius XM.

[00:06:30]  it's a good massage jim yeah when i had to turn over oh no i was like i called it quits oh now you  drew the line yeah i'm like yeah i'm not comfortable with this side and i went downstairs like you're not  gonna like to and then we left and we went and we stayed in a park until nighttime we sat there we  parked next to a creek until nighttime we came back in the house slept and the next day we checked out 
[00:07:00]  but i clearly could have been why didn't you check out that day and just go to a hotel we were stuck i  didn't know where we were in the middle of nowhere we were in like montana the grand tetans were at  we're in the middle of nowhere it was horrible that guy was fucking so close to it to a to getting in  my bone hole yeah yeah it's a lot of action what a trooper you are though after a little asshole  tickling you still turned over from him if you would have just like perched your ass up a little 
[00:07:30]  bit seriously we would have had a situation he'd have slid a digit in there yeah he definitely was  suspect i just remember you think jeez wow colombo  that was the weird part that she she called him out though good for her it's a great story  yes good for her and i didn't you're weird like you do i punch him out is he really just trying 
[00:08:00]  to sell the massage is he trying to get a menage a twilight what's going on like i would have thought  you'd have said something like two what are you doing man i should have i should have yeah yeah  because that isn't even like i think in combative it's kind of like what are you doing i might you  know and that's that's probably where where marijuana can hurt you  everything's cool right that's all cool yeah this guy's just doing his own thing and right  who am i to fucking judge and fuck that makes sense that makes sense when that if i had if i had 
[00:08:30]  drink it too he would have been missing teeth he would have been missing teeth hey faggot  what's your problem dog faggot headache hey you want to see a magic trick  hey your teeth are about to disappear  hey here's my weenie you want to play hide the baloney you want to massage guess what 
[00:09:00]  let's watch your eyes pop open why bung you from behold doug how's that how's that for a magic  trip it's an illusion it's an illusion that i'm bunging you from behind doug  we forgot from over that brewer uses smoke pod and it makes complete sense now yes yeah now it  makes sense yes yeah were you just like i was totally into the one hitter so yeah it's cool 
[00:09:30]  man she's feeling my wife up you know this is these are my hang-ups out here in montana these are my  hang-ups man i don't need to put them on him he's the cool guy he's the guy that's got it together  i'm fucked up he obviously knows what's going on here there's no reason for rage against doug  fuck that punch him in the face right i should have fucking when did you realize that you checked  in and when did you get the first creepy vibe from doug right off the bat right right off wow yeah 
[00:10:00]  i didn't like him from the beginning yeah what did you do that made you not like him was his vibe or  he you know what it's about looking like doug henning it's probably a little right off the bat  looking like doug henning and and they were really they were a little too uh hippie slash  earthy for me oh he had a girl he did have a girl but even she was a little suspect a lot of granola  before granola was in uh-huh all right and so it was like um you know once when people shake your 
[00:10:30]  hand that you do the limp thing that really bothers me yeah it really like dude shake my hand you think  he would have popped your cock in his mouth though if you would have let him i think i i think i would  have had such i think you were gonna let me dirty his hair he would have eaten your ass on that table  oh god jesus dude yeah oh that's oh man god only knows what shenanigans happens in that house 
[00:11:00]  oh yeah you said shenanigans this morning i almost pulled over i started laughing so hard  oh and he gets the right combination of people in there dude you're the first one to say no he  probably couldn't believe it you're right you're right you're the first one that actually went for  the naked massage yeah yeah that didn't end up with a fucking massage he let it go oh that guy  was counting his fucking chickens that that day oh god i got a naked massage get fucking i'm done i'm  jerking off while he massaged you like you'd probably feel like if you look back this time he's just  rubbing you with one hand he's probably plumping his dick up with the other putting that chlorinated 
[00:11:30]  smelling lotion on your back yeah rubbing it deep it's a deep tissue massage i bet he's too close to  the table to get his rod against your knuckles because my hot stone first i dip it in the hot  lava and then i rub it on your back yeah you like that massage  he definitely has a history that's great yeah you don't need any sheets did you guys talk about it 
[00:12:00]  afterwards oh god no no no there was no more oh me and d yeah yeah oh god yes yeah yeah i'm like d  you're not gonna like that you gotta she says she always questions me if something happened because  i'd never talked i just went down you're not doing it holy fuck that's great man it was i'm telling  we got in a car and we drove to a creek that was close by and we we just stayed in the car until it 
[00:12:30]  got dark now what was the conversation like there were you just like because you had to silence  what a lot of silence yeah let's look to try to figure it out wow it was really weird and creepy  no shit then i was a little worried at nighttime we were the only ones staying at the bed and breakfast  was there a lock on your door there was but still yeah you could have the key well that's true it's his  house right but i knew i could physically take him but then again as a weapon that's right he could 
[00:13:00]  have been a have a gun an assault weapon that's all he did good old that's right man the worst of the  week countdown countdown still a lot to get to here on the countdown i'm sam roberts from opian anthony  and after opian anthony live dwight gooden was in studio this week baseball legend uh crispin glover  was in studio talking about back to the future david lee roth was back in studio jim brewer was in 
[00:13:30]  studio i know we just heard him but we're going to hear him again kevin smith was in studio ethan  hawk was in studio and that's what i want to play for you now we'll hear all those other guys later  ethan hawk stopped by jay moore was in studio alongside him uh but ethan hawk stopped by to  promote his new movie the purge and basically the concept of this movie is the one night a week  or one night a week that would be fucking badass one night a year all crime murder rape everything  is legal and i don't know why a country would do that but this country in this movie does it 
[00:14:00]  and ethan hawk lives in that country and he really wants people to go see the movie where he's doing  all this so then so he came on the opian anthony show and talked to us with the hopes that you guys  would go see the movie so do him a friendly would you it's ethan hawk on the countdown  how you doing ethan hawk in studio in here i know right i'm yammering on about about my 
[00:14:30]  mid-level club dates jay moore to your right broadway yeah how are you we sat next to each  other at anix game a few times your beautiful son yeah well thanks nate no they didn't win  because nate robinson was there oh yeah oh boy that's when they had the all green jerseys on  i do remember that yeah it was you on one side of me and kerry washington on the other side of me  and i went if a bomb hits this row i'm not even in the article  ethan hawk and others died and others uh ethan's got uh the purge the purge and uh this is a real 
[00:15:00]  interesting concept uh one day a year people can do whatever the hell they want as far as uh  illegal stuff goes including murder the idea is it takes place uh you know and like in the near  future after the great depression of 2017 and oh and uh as the nation recovers to bring down  unemployment uh and to purge the nation of its national hate uh one day a year the government 
[00:15:30]  shuts down no hospitals no cops no nothing and you can do whatever you want in this way  if you get screwed in the land deal you don't need to worry about it you don't need to get a lawyer  you don't need to sue you just wait for the purge day and you kill the guy right this sounds  fantastic your wife is driving you crazy she's getting on your nerves don't sweat it wait for  purge night i sir right and so now the good news about this is that uh unemployment drops to zero 
[00:16:00]  sure right because basically all the unemployed people kill each other  and uh you know i mean it's a a little bit influenced when i was younger i remember did you  guys see escape from new york oh of course yeah right snake plissken everything yeah it's the same  kind of john carpenter-esque uh half thriller half horror half um socio-political document because  what it really is is it's like any good science fiction it's not really that science fiction 
[00:16:30]  uh-huh it you know the woman is on the treadmill and she's jogging and on tv you know outside her  gated community people are killing each other right right but it's not that different from the way we  actually what's really happening right i hope there's no 80s bad guy though like the guy who is  like uh the president we have the president remember that guy with the billy idol haircut  oh yeah this is a kid in this movie um who is i think the best bad guy i've ever been a part of  his performance was phenomenal yeah um unfortunately he'll never work again he's so scary 
[00:17:00]  so so now once a year this happens now your character your family guy well see this is where  you get it gets kind of interesting i am extremely affluent man who is a family guy who has made a  fortune selling security systems so he's very safe you know he's living in this gated community yes  you know machine guy he's all the bells and whistles you need to fend off these uh nuts  my son thinks this purge is immoral my son's giving me some kind of ethics class about how 
[00:17:30]  it's really not fair to the poor people it's really not fair that we just because we're rich  we get safe and we get special privileges how is that fair sounds like me every day of the week  when i talk about taxes and exactly and so my son ends up well made letting a guy  safe house in our house and trouble is this guy is very seriously wanted oh by the nazi youth of  america uh the social network going bad these other guys start coming after him in our house and so 
[00:18:00]  right puts all your good gear to the test i guess so they're all like young youthful nazis  that are coming after him well not literally they're they're like skinheads well no the today's  version of skinheads which is like computer geek preppy people all right does that make sense to  you because well you seem lost here and where did i lose you no i'm actually just thinking of the  people he's talking about yeah yeah yeah well i have a question yeah uh when i see the promos 
[00:18:30]  there's people wearing masks like spooky masks breaking into houses that's got to be like the  longest pre-production meeting more than casting is figuring out what mask to settle on because  if done right like scream the mask lives in perpetuity yeah and done poorly just people  running around in a nixon mask like johnny utah i'll take your comments off the air  governor's tonight i think that uh a lot of thought did go into the mask but then the director had 
[00:19:00]  seen this certain mask uh but long before production started doesn't that creep you out about your  director that he's looking at masks before the movie came like ah you know i just combed the internet  look at masks when you read the script i was already creeped out by this guy  well done that's uh yeah that sounds pretty good i saw the trailer um in the theater when i was  seeing i think a star trek or something and it looks uh it looks pretty badass yeah it's pretty cool  it turned out pretty good so there are explanations to why people don't because like i think like if 
[00:19:30]  that was happening i would just get in the car and fucking go to a lake somewhere and just wait  until the next day because some hillbilly at the lake will have you that's why you can't do that  have you ever seen the movies i mean how lake is safe that's a good point yeah lakes are disaster  you don't want to be caught out there on the road defenseless i just find myself a nice spooky cabin  in the woods that's an old lake what it says abandoned yeah yeah exactly go hide out in an  abandoned hospital that's a good one i'm just a sweet i'm a sweet naive boy i don't know any better 
[00:20:00]  so now you well you must get into some pretty uh bad situations there you got to defend the family  right because i'm assuming at some point it's not just this guy's wanted and it's in this house and  then it ends going well the house held up again yeah you know something probably there's probably a  breach i have a pretty terrifying line in the movie where the wife screams you know but we're safe  right and he's like well oh well you mean safe oh you know it's a relative term yeah these things are

[00:25:30]  highlighting the best moments from the opian anthony show this week still to come is david lee roth and  dwight gooden and crispin glover and more jim brewer and kevin smith first let's talk about rob  delaney this is a guy uh his first appearance on the show this week it's a big week of radio for opian  anthony rob delaney's first time on the opian anthony show nobody had heard of this guy he was a nobody  until this thing called twitter popped up this guy pumps out a couple of jokes that gets people 
[00:26:00]  laughing on this twitter machine and all of a sudden he's america's sweetheart i don't know how  it happened maybe rob delaney does as he makes his debut on the opian anthony show  number six rob delaney coming into the studio yeah the board game yeah is that what you're 
[00:26:30]  promoting besides the stand-up gig at carolines yeah yeah good for you you know and i know it's insane  but a few months ago a board game company approached me because i write a lot of jokes  on twitter and i've written like 15 000 of them by now and uh you're great on twitter thank you very  much we said thank you yeah but i have one of the good ones man i have a sickness where i need if i'm  not on stage i have to be like like jerking off onto my phone screen trying to make people laugh and  so i um or writing jokes on it and the the board game company approached me and said hey could we make 
[00:27:00]  a game out of your tweets and i was like i've never said yes faster because i love if you think  about like obviously we all love comedy but like if you're like playing game night and stuff like  you can like throw up from laughing if you're playing like with your relative i mean you get  in a fist fight like yeah it's such an awesome experience so the idea that any of my jokes would  be even peripherally involved with like something like that i said i was so excited yeah what is the  can we uh i have not i i briefly took the board out before um but you gotta explain the there was a 
[00:27:30]  there's a picture of you in your twitter photo yeah an upsetting image green uh yeah actually uh  the fucking awful green bathing suit yeah which highlights uh rob's cock but uh you can tell that  i'm circumcised which is such a bummer i have two sons and we didn't circumcise them and i i see their  cute little penises when i change their diapers and i envy them why did i do the same way man yeah my  parents cut off half my dick threw in the garbage it's i want it back i fucking i'm kind of annoyed 
[00:28:00]  that i'm clipped yeah you'd probably be pissed then if you were you know because the foreskin's  always greener probably thinking like you know if you were in circumcised you'd be like yeah  that was supposed to be better as long as you keep it clean and shit it's supposed to be fucking  better like i hate the fact that the head of my cock is all exposed i would love to have a nice  sheath covering it really you're not going into battle with it no i know but  usually then we could dock and everything um it's very hard to dock so what the reason i asked  this and i wanted to wait till you hear is because i took it out uh it's called war of words yep but 
[00:28:30]  there's these weird little the thing okay those are the game pieces oh they are okay and and since  we're on uh radio i'll say the game pieces we've got a van that says ss butt toucher on it we've got a  nice wizard hat a ham sandwich a cup of coffee and an alarm clock that says it's 420 with a  marijuana leaf and a big red circle with a slasher now do they consult you on this or did they just  yeah those were my choices in fact those game pieces oh so they said you had you leave it a part 
[00:29:00]  of it yeah so i was involved like i would do test plays and stuff i mean all the all the jokes in it  are mine but the scaffolding or the skeleton of it was designed by people who actually know how to  make games not by an idiot me um but yeah basically you you just roll a dice and depending  on what you roll it decides if you're gonna like have to finish a joke of mine if you're gonna have  to try to one-up it or tag it or whatever and um things like that so and there's a subjective 
[00:29:30]  element where the people watching can or playing with you can be like yeah no rick's was better  even if it wasn't you can just be like fuck you i prefer rick so that's what the good stuff so  if you're playing with your mom or whatever you know she might wind up slapping you because you  pick your aunt suzy instead of her and you got to me that's a game yeah and then you punch your  mom and any game where you're not punching your mom is a shitty game that's why like have you ever  heard of candy land you haven't right that's because you don't punch your mom when you play  that's an old classic yeah anyway shoot some ladders i love shoots and ladders oh drat  shoot some ladders we got it yep maybe i'm cheesy i wasn't called their grandmother a cunt over a game 
[00:30:00]  i wish i could say i hadn't so okay there's three different call okay so people will land on a joke  and then have to finish it yeah and then the cool part is is there's just a fat deck of my cards which  you could even just take into the toilet and read you know three jokes per page and uh or i guess card  a card is like a tiny page that yes it is that's uh wow that's a lot of jokes yeah there's a lot of 
[00:30:30]  jokes in there oh man fuck yeah a board game somebody sent me on twitter they were like the  only is there was somebody was like i've been trying they were like first of all fuck you for  making a board game and i said you're correct fuck me i should why did i do that and then  they said the only other comedian i could find who did that was rodney dangerfield and so  you know that's uh it'll work but you're in good company yeah what was it like i was like i don't  get no respect yeah no sure it's called get no respect yeah oh by milton bradley milton bradley  play the rodney dangerfield game see if you can get respect from your right 
[00:31:00]  i like the fact that your game doesn't have uh batteries or a pop-o-matic or anything that's  yeah it is in that sense and uh yeah if you like if you like trivial pursuit you'll notice the box  is kind of the same shape yeah little square thing thick square yeah it's not your traditional  monopoly long box more cubel hasn't sold uh you know it has started to it's exclusively through 
[00:31:30]  amazon right now and i'm told that what they do is they figure out all their weird algorithms and  stuff and then like a few weeks after it's out which it just came out then they'll start to sell  it so you plug it on twitter and yeah and frankly i hope people buy it but if they don't i still got a  game you know what i mean like i wasn't like oh i hope i make money on a board game i'm not a crazy  person i was just like it's an honor to have it it's so cool people play it and people write me and 
[00:32:00]  say that they are playing it so good great it is pretty cool to have a game you know yeah are you  the only one on twitter that doesn't have haters oh i have so many haters so many visceral i mean  hatred that could power a city yeah amazing now most people and and more than 50 percent of people  are nice kind funny exactly like they'll i'll do a joke and they'll write something back to me it's  like 10 times funnier so i i feel good about humanity generally because of twitter but still  because of the number of followers that i have the number of people who hate me and want me to die 
[00:32:30]  are very high and big and there is a robust organization yeah yeah the uh boy and they just  wait what is the problem they have call your eyes out for what is the problem they have with  with you why oh last night somebody wrote me uh somebody wrote me and they said what would you do  if you were at a if you were doing an open mic and every comic before you was a misogynist and i  wrote back i was like i would i would get up and i would take a deep breath from a stage and i would 
[00:33:00]  lacerate them in a fun and funny way and uh because that'd be a shitty boring show you  know and then i just talked about how i think like you know i think women are are filthy and  dynamic just like men and i think if something isn't funny if it's funny to a group of men and  it's not funny to a group of women it's probably not as funny as it could be it's i'm it's like  egalitarian you want to be like like prior or carlin would be fucking outrageous and women would be  like yay and so i think you know so i wrote that and then people would be wrote me back and were 
[00:33:30]  like fucking faggot you know and like i'd be like they've gotta be kidding and then i'd look  and they totally weren't and i'm like like how dare you you know and just ridiculous so but the  thing is is you can find the we live in an amazing world and the internet allows you to connect to all  these people you can focus on the scumbags of which there are myriad or you can focus on the good  people i try to do that more uh because yeah there will always be garbage people but fuck them they 
[00:34:00]  choke to death i think it's a pretty accurate depiction of society yeah yeah you look at the  numbers and think like yeah i bet there's that many scumbags per good person uh out there and how  many followers you got now uh like eight hundred and fifty thousand heading toward a mil 59 uh you're  about to yeah it's a funny account too it really is rare that i read twitter and laugh out loud but  there's been a few things you've written that i was like fucking like like that i just laughed and 
[00:34:30]  i don't laugh out loud tweets wow well thank you and your avatar is just famous now it's  disgusting it's just famous you can't change that once well that damn avatar pops up everywhere well  that's the thing people a lot of guys like will write me and be like hey i want to follow you but  i ain't looking at that fucking picture i'll be like then you'll never follow me i mean the more  people hate it the harder i i affix it to my profile i never understood that so are you fucking 
[00:35:00]  like there'd be a funny video you want to put a link to from youtube or something like that  and you know that might be something that may be a little uh homoerotic at the beginning of it  but but the payoff is there it's something and it's like dude i made it through two seconds today  so you can watch that fucking homo shit wow are you like i don't have mirrors in my own bathroom  i want to see my own penis  it's like you're missing out on something that has nothing to do with you being a

[00:41:00]  we didn't uh know this was happening today this is great how are you is there an occasion what's the  occasion that's a good question specific occasions your book is brand new yeah it's a memoir definitely  yeah yeah memoirs huh that's uh of of quite the uh quite the career are they good memories or bad  memories or are they saleable let's look at everything in there it's the good memories the 
[00:41:30]  bad memories the not so good memories what was going on in my head during the times of the good  memories and the bad memories yeah yeah you'd start the book with a chilling it's like really sad and  frustrating story about the the uh world series uh the parade and in the uh uh and when you missed  that it's fucking heartbreaking through i kept even though i knew how it ended i kept hoping like  just go just go you're watching this frustrating drug addicted yeah but nevertheless somebody once said  if somebody made a movie of your life would a lot of people go to see it and it sounds like a lot 
[00:42:00]  of people would and that's a success story that's that story that i love it i'm still allowed to tell  the story is amazing hello right right which is uh yiddish for yo come on definitely because but  you mentioned uh missing the parade that night was like supposed to be the happiest day of my  baseball career uh-huh turned out to be the saddest day of my baseball career you know you end up in a  project you're doing drugs and drinking with strangers you don't even know and you know you're watching  the parade on tv that was me that was you that was me and the thing about it you don't get to redo that 
[00:42:30]  right right that's that's a one-off man if you miss it that's a big one but talking about the people  that you were getting high with and how like you know you start off the night loving these people and  it's fun and it's camaraderie and then by the end of the night you just i want to just get the fuck  out of here the sun is coming like knowing that you're about to miss it and it happens anyway oh it's  just a i mean the the worst experience you could ever imagine in your life because like you said  the idea was to go there do a little bit and get out of there and go finish you know celebrate with 
[00:43:00]  my teammates obviously i got there and it never ends that way not for me anyway with uh cocaine  normally when i go on bench with that it's a three-day thing and that's just the way it is and  cocaine's a tricky drug wow oh in my rock band getting loaded wasn't like an episode thing it was a  seasonal thing it's like first okay it's summertime let's get loaded right oh yes definitely it's  tuesday let's get loaded yeah right no no i mean all summer all summer all summer yes were you a  drug guy david lee roth no i'm a beer and pot that's what i thought i'm an outdoor kind of you know i got 
[00:43:30]  lucky my bad habits are more like two chicks in a toaster oven but we'll be yeah that's uh please  continue stayed away from the white stuff huh how old no i did everything i sampled everything i tried  everything but i just snuck out from under it because i had i was going to also be a samurai warrior you  know and i had to be in the gym but that's the only reason i didn't have any self-control for about  20 years were they were they piss testing back then in baseball because it's amazing me that you were  able to do all that coke and still and still play and not get kicked out or well it's a situation 
[00:44:00]  where um normally they can't test you unless you've been through a program or you tested positive  before or got in trouble or something like that up until the time where the meds decided to test me  in the spring training in 1987 i hadn't been in any trouble for it um there's a lot of um there's a  there's a pattern there that could have led to that that they could have saw what was going on  so actually in spring training 87 it got to the point where obviously you missed the parade after  the 86 season get into a scuff with the cops after the 86 season you get the spring training you know 
[00:44:30]  showing up late they knew something went wrong and one day they called me in and said we'd like to  test you me not knowing the whole thing all i knew is i enjoyed doing cocaine not knowing how long  i stayed in the system not knowing that i had my rights that i could have refused to test  so i figured i hadn't done nothing in a day go ahead and test me and by doing that it was a good  thing and a bad thing um obviously the test came back positive at that point they said we need to  go to rehab and we'll continue to pay your salary or if you choose not to go to rehab we're going to 
[00:45:00]  suspend you i'll pay so even though i still was in denial didn't think i had a problem i decided i'll  go to rehab i'll mark count the days down you know 30 days till i'm done and i still get my pay so  obviously i went to the rehab to smithers was a great program but i didn't try to get anything out of it  because i still think i had a problem who even knew what rehab was in those days that was something  you sent uncle bob to when he was up to a court or whatever there people still thought cocaine  wasn't addictive that that was rock star stuff to do and you you a lot of times you'd sign up to go  into showbiz so you could do that we decided we were going to break all the records those included 
[00:45:30]  you know we were going to make elvis look like a beginner i was going to make keith richards look  like a freaking boy scout you know so these days the perspective on it is very different the  reality entered into the picture of course but it's totally different now and obviously like you  said you think it's not you know addictive or whatever but and then plus the danger of it now  you don't know what's in this stuff you're taking oh man yeah what was the first sign because you said  that uh you talked about when you missed the parade but before that the mets had been there 
[00:46:00]  been rumors about your drug use and what was the first sign or what first tipped them off to like  who are you looking at jim  i think what set them off was um you know hanging out at different um party spots in the city where  you know basically drugs are known to be at and um hanging out at those places so obviously  major league baseball called myself in and questioned me as well as daryl about you know using drugs and  of course you deny it sure no it's not me and of course daryl said no it's doc you know but uh that 
[00:46:30]  happens but uh you know at that time obviously i was using and you know at that point i refused to  be tasked by major league baseball where do you think this came from because uh you know anybody  looking in from the outside you're at the top of your game i mean you're you're a star uh world  series i mean where do you think that came from well uh i can tell you exactly where it came from it  came from all the pressure all the expectations not only from the media but then the expectations i started  putting on myself uh for example like 84 my rookie year when i came into the league at 19 years old 
[00:47:00]  really wasn't much expectations to after the all-star break then especially right and then i have my  career in 1985 so 86 everything i did was compared to 85 for you know for example 86 was a good year  it was three it was three months shorter than most years because it was up all night though  yes yep you got you so so now uh like if i if i won a game against say like fernando vanesweller or  her shot if i won two nothing you know complete game shutout but i only had four strikeouts the 
[00:47:30]  first question would be what happened you don't have four strikeouts oh wow so the next start i'm  going out trying to get 10 strikeouts trying to pitch a complete game trying to pitch a shutout  and just all expectations just trying to live up to that and what i started doing is medicating myself  you know with drugs and alcohol so you listen to the credit it's athletes i know get like you know  entertainers get critics and stuff and athletes get killed on the back page that would affect you  what they were saying about you oh 100 i think most players maybe it's a two percent maybe don't 
[00:48:00]  um affect but myself you know um obviously unfortunately being a people pleaser as well  i pay attention to the papers pay attention to what's being said and anything you see it affected  me because now i got to go out i got to do better and it took away the fun of the game and you would  uh it was nice to read too you talked about your father a lot and you and what an influence he was  and you were the first boy in the family so he became obsessed with just you and baseball  and uh you would call him after every game and kind of share that with him yeah definitely my dad is  the one that really taught me the game i remember as a kid uh sitting there watching the games on tv 
[00:48:30]  with him back then it wasn't all the um baseball networks you just got the game a week on saturday  they won't have a game on the radio whatever the team was you know local close by at that time and  watching games and he taught me the game so once i made it after every game we had this deal where  he had a big salad dish back then after the game was over before i even talked to the media  i'll call my dad you know we'll talk about baseball and go over the game what i could have done  differently even if i pitch out he'll find something that could have been done differently just kind of  keep me humble would that bother you if he criticized it or would you actually look for his advice and 
[00:49:00]  counsel i want you to draw i always look for it it didn't really bother me because we're just doing  is trying to even like say like during the 85 season he's just trying to give me something to work  on between starts where you don't just settle for having a good game did he know you were in trouble with  drugs at that point you know it's funny is uh like like i talked about a lot in the book where  in 87 i tested positive i had to come home and tell my parents that you know i gotta go to rehab um  my mom she always knew something wasn't right i think my dad kind of looked the other way a little 
[00:49:30]  bit and plus my dad you know he had his drinking problem as well so when i told him you know i  followed the drug test hey we have my mom basically said well that's great you can get the help you need  where my dad just kind of dropped his head oh wow and never said a word  wow really he doesn't want the spotlight at that point in time you know if he's got an issue then  you know a little bit of your spotlight of that issue would get towards it i had too many temptations  it was it was started off as jesus the longer i stay up the more we can girls we can sleep with  and the more guys we can go jam blues with and then we can just stay up all the way until we're into 
[00:50:00]  the next city and uh we could do that for three days in a row you follow that's why we started  drinking jack daniels but the press but the press looks at a rock band a lot differently that's cool  oh well you're supported you're supposed to do it it's completely different world and it's like  like like like what are you doing yeah you're you're i don't think he could have been swigging  jack daniel right right yeah in my department people get upset if you didn't party 
[00:50:30]  actually i kind of like uh i'm thinking about doing another marathon they go whoa whoa what  happened to uh yeah yeah five in the morning day the mess pr has its own pressure on you as well  the mess pr wouldn't be thrilled doc fuck two girls get a picture out quick  it's you know rock stars and athletes i think have different expectations yeah yeah a little bit  totally different game but uh you also definitely have a lot of respect  oh god you told a great story too in the book about your dad uh 
[00:51:00]  being uh shot by uh or shot at by your uh your mom uh so you grew up in a very interesting  house yeah it's very interesting as a kid you know unfortunately and i'm sick it may sound but  you thought those were normal things that took place in every family yeah um well they kind of are  depending on what point of the map you're pointing at it's not so unusual in a lot of neighborhoods that  is common life and so forth you know please yeah so uh when that happened actually my dad was having 
[00:51:30]  an affair and a lot of times he'll take me he'll tell my mom that i want to go get some cookies and  juice or whatever but what he would do is ask me you want to go to the store which any kid would say  yes i want to go to the store so i'll go to the store we get the cookies and juice and then we'll go  to his girlfriend's house her oldest daughter will come outside in the car and kind of babysit me  while he's in there taking care of his business and somehow my mom found out what was going on  and there's one particular day she followed him to the house and oh wow when him and the woman's 
[00:52:00]  coming out she actually you know shot it shot at him and the woman she actually hit him in the  shoulder and she always tell me the story when she was upset that she didn't get the woman as well  wow wow i mean i'm almost the sweetest lady but also she could be the toughest lady oh man woman  scorned we got a question from uh the guy in the corner uh it's ironic to me like when you get high  as an athlete i i don't think you guys are aware of the high you provide us on a daily basis i was at 
[00:52:30]  your no hitter at yankee stadium just a tuesday that's all i remember what most about your no hitter  it was it was just a tuesday and that's a no hitter it's the craziest thing you could ever be a part  of because the super bowl the world series the all-star game you bring all your hype with you  a no hitter it's fucking tuesday and your friend goes do you want to come you're like all right you  know what i'll go and then by the seventh inning you can't breathe and then you had you threw like 
[00:53:00]  a hundred and ninety pitches in that game you walked eight it was the mariners and it was like  paul sorrento jay buter like the the last five guys you faced it was like oh my god it's in the  seventh inning is he going to come out for the eighth eighth inning now he's got to come out for  the ninth that was probably athletic uh viewing at second place being larry johnson hitting the  three in the garden against the pacers your no hitter was like that was the biggest high for me  in the world it's so it's just ironic that so many athletes fall into the traps of drugs but i guess 
[00:53:30]  that's what we're all doing we're just chasing the dragon every time we go to the stadium  at the end of a game like that you feel as tired as the guy actually playing yeah were you high on  the air on the air on the mound now i was never i never used never used before the game or during  the game or anything yeah that's self-control right there but i was already premeditated after the  game what about daryl did he use during the game after the game was um i was going to use either  to celebrate or i was going to lose i mean use because i was pissed right right right there i'm not 
[00:54:00]  sure i'm not sure what he did is that the breakfast of champions that you're eating yes thanks for  pointing it out there david le wrong trying to finally eat breakfast multi-grain cheerios if you  need to know in uh the bad guys one there's been a bunch of mets books about that era and it seemed  like and i'm not asking to air your guy out or throw your guy under the bus under any situation  you can only speak for yourself i know that but it it seemed like once the test started coming back 
[00:54:30]  there seemed to be this sort of like oh you got to talk to daryl or daryl would say oh you got to  talk to doc this sort of like uh running back and forth like it wasn't me it was him it wasn't him  it was me was that the media making that up or was it like i'm gonna get suspended i better  well no not at all for me when anytime the rumors came around with me they asked me  or even after when i failed my test in 87 the mets it made the baseball and there was  who's you using what was your teammates you better tell us if you don't tell us 
[00:55:00]  this was gonna happen and i just said well and then the truth was i was basically used by myself  i mean me and daryl used together occasionally like say in 86 but outside of one or two times  that was it you know obviously he's been public with his troubles i'm in public mine but we never  really parted together are you uh are you you sober now are things good now yeah two and a half years  yeah i like that let's do it i got 32 days clean and sober not in a row since january since january 
[00:55:30]  that's got to be weird to be at a meeting and uh and doc hood and sitting across from you sharing  i'm like i had a rough day my barbecue didn't fire up and you're like well when i won my world  series ring you're like wait a minute is this the three o'clock moore park meeting well where are we  there is a three o'clock moore park meeting i know that's and a one o'clock it's amazing you say that  though but you know anytime i'm in the meetings you know that uh obviously everybody's in there from  different walks of life yeah but we're all there for the same come and go that's right and that's 
[00:56:00]  the main you know help each other stay clean and sober just for that day yeah it is tomorrow do the  same thing it is an amazing uh we'll just say a program that it really is when you walk in  nobody gives a shit we're all just trying to keep our lives together it's it's pretty cool yeah yeah  that's the main thing what's good about the book too is and listening to you talk we were talking  about when people write something in the book dave and i were talking about how they don't want to  talk about it on on the air and you're brutally honest it's great like that that really makes people 
[00:56:30]  want to read a book it's like you're not coming in going well i don't know god you're like just  fucking this is everything that happened here it is and that's what i wish everybody would do when  they put out a book and they and they talk about their life it's brutally honest if i don't see  myself if i don't see myself reflected in your eyes i'm going to get out within 30 seconds of your  story you follow and the stuff that attracts me most to people's stories and people's backgrounds  are the flaws the cracks in the woodwork the fractures your favorite jeans are the ones that are  most fucked up with the holes in the knees and the old boots that aren't polished and that's the 
[00:57:00]  most interesting thing about each other as human beings as long as there's no hole in the back of  the jeans but that you mentioned that you know for me what kept me sick for so long is like you know  you're sick is just secrets and for a long time like you mentioned i would tell half the story  i wasn't comfortable telling the whole story it took a while for me to admit that i have a disease it  took a long time to admit that i'm an addict i'm alcoholic those words when i said i kind of stumbled  all of them because i was still in denial and to me it was like um that means you're weak so i 
[00:57:30]  found it to a point that hey i'm dying thinking i'm i got this stuff under control because i mean  i've been to prisons i've been to jails i've been to rehabs so the only thing left for me is the  cemetery if i choose to go back out there so it was just a time in my life where i was just tired  of living that lifestyle and when you surrender you have to surrender everything because i was trying  to hold on to the lifestyle without that calling drugs but it doesn't work that way so  i had to come clean and just get this is what happened like you say this is not who i am today  but these things that i went through and i can go right back to that if i was to choose to pick up 
[00:58:00]  or take that one drink and how long were you in jail for i mean we all remember when you went and it's  weird to see such an iconic figure going oh my fucking god that is what happens like when you when  you keep going oh it was a horrible time i mean i was in jail for well prison actually for 10 and a  half months um it's tough to go to prison at any time in your life but you go in at 40 for the first  time was horrible especially when you have little kids you know and daughters especially where if  something happens nothing you can do wow you only get a 15 minute phone call per day and if you miss 
[00:58:30]  that time you know big bubba ain't gonna give up his time right you're done that's the way it is  how did they treat you in jail i mean was it uh because you are who you are was that good or bad  it was uh a little bit of both when i first got there i think it was a situation where they wanted  to see how you was gonna come in how it's gonna be just based on the name um right away they made it  known that in here there's no names right right you're a number and you're no different than the  other guy you're gonna pick up the trash you're gonna do it when i tell you you're gonna shower  when i tell you you're gonna wear what we tell you to wear you're gonna clear up the yard when we tell 
[00:59:00]  you you're gonna eat when we tell you and you're gonna eat what we tell you so it was a whole big  adjustment but um i just came in and tried to be as humble as i can and just kept my distance from  everyone and as time went on you know we started to kind of i wouldn't say fit in is the right word  but you came to kind of adapt a little bit on certain days but certain days you thought you're  gonna lose your mind wow it's because you're coming from i mean if a jail for anybody sucks but coming  from a place of being you know like jay said the no hitter the world's all this great glory to to come 
[00:59:30]  to this place you got to wonder like what what the fuck was i thinking what happened yeah what happened  exactly exactly right and some days to be honest with you guys some days i'll wake up and say oh this  gotta be a dream i'm gonna wake up in my bed it's gotta be a dream they should say how am i gonna make it  not just you know 10 months but how am i gonna make it to the next day how am i gonna make it  you know uh like i mean you carry your food and sometimes you got some guys that if they want  your food they're gonna take it i mean you got 10 guys there's nothing you can do i mean as a  gentleman i saw i didn't literally see him get raped but you're just like about five feet from the 
[01:00:00]  shower and you hear him screaming for his life and then oh man so you wanted oh my god next you know  you don't know is this a harbor well of living did that guy look anything like me the one who was  being assaulted i imagine i'd be quite popular in that setting i'm certain of it it's a harbor  situation doc what was it i felt that way during accounting meetings you know with my accountant  you know when warner brothers signs a contract i felt that way i wasn't you know two different worlds  two different worlds that was great in that time period everybody every athlete just got arrested 
[01:00:30]  in tampa like tampa was just where you went to get put in jail whether every single athlete you  just seem coming out of tampa jail that makes perfect sense because that's a port entry right  that that miami is where you know all the way he says rape in the shower you say port of entry  i don't think he wants to hear that i don't this is freaking me out now can you look back on on  those great moments obviously as an athlete and not and be able to put away the the part that kind 
[01:01:00]  of taints that because it seems like it would be such a waste to have such a great career great  memories professionally but it's always got that that nagging drug problem hanging over him you  know that's a great question because of course i was going to ask it but no you weren't all right  no because what happened was so many times when i would relapse so many times when i go on these  binges it was because i was guilty depressed and upset because i was thinking what my career should  have been what others thought my career should have been more more so than me thinking that 
[01:01:30]  when you hear everybody say oh you should be in the hall of fame or you should win 300 games  yeah i should beat myself up with that a lot of time and start believing that unfortunately when  i was in prison the only good thing i can say came out of that was even though i got in trouble  in 2010 when i came out of prison in 06 but when i was in prison when you got nothing but time  i mean nothing but time and you're not going anywhere i had a chance to really have my life  replay the whole tape the good and bad and everything right place and i came across the thing i said you  know what when i was a kid i remember telling my dad was watching the game i said my goal is to i want to 
[01:02:00]  make the major leagues i want to stay healthy and play a long time i never thought about awards  never thought about the hall of fame never thought about you know winning 300 games royal series you  don't think about that things um i got to win every award possibly for a pitcher i had three royal  series rings in new york um i was through the no hitter yeah i mean so when i looked back on i said  look i can't beat myself up over stuff anymore because others expectations of me because when i was five 
[01:02:30]  years old nobody thought this guy's gonna be a hall of fame pitcher he's gonna win 300 games  i got to really live a career that most players would dream of living so i had to eliminate that  part because i found out also in rehab that by me beating myself over that all i was doing was  giving myself a reason to go back out and use uh-huh so i had to eliminate all that and like you say  start patting myself on the bike for the career that i did yeah you could look i guess uh prison  will give you a ton of put things in perspective what did you do what did you use your time to do  because something we started off talking about chess briefly there and i know a lot of the fellas who 
[01:03:00]  work at the chess clubs downtown if you see a ton of forearm tattoos watch out because he's been  playing chess constantly for his entire stay some guys read a lot some folks get into the bible  something what did you use your time doing in my time once i was there and i kind of accepted that  i'm going to be here for 10 and a half months i got in this thing where um normally i would like  that this um the track i used to walk the track a lot i basically stayed to myself i didn't play  any softball so occasionally i'll play i must have been pissed yeah that's the movie 
[01:03:30]  he's gonna play against the guards that's right you know what happened i had this guy kind of tell  me when i was in a county jail before i got sent off to prison kind of pre-warned me he goes when  you get to prison stay by yourself because when you get there they have sports they're going to  already have you on a team oh yeah and if you're on that team the other team's gonna be pissed  right and if you're on that team you're not doing well your team's gonna be pissed and you don't  want that and it's probably gonna go past just the team and the game that's gonna work its way 
[01:04:00]  into the actual life 100 so i got there it's like you're on our team i was like well i can't play  my knees bad which yeah oh good yeah i didn't want to know part of it so i played a lot of horseshoe  love horseshoe and basically just walked the track and that was basically all i did yeah stay in shape  an entire channel we are gathered here today an entire channel when you're on fire people will get  out of your way an entire channel it's water cold dedicated to the comic genius yeah and indeed too

[01:09:00]  opian anthony show and after opian anthony live highlighting all the great things that happened  this week on the opian anthony show and what a week it was for radio crispin glover david lee roth  our buddy kevin smith came by we'll get to those other guys in a little while but kevin smith stopped  by he's a guy who's always got something to say he's always got an opinion and he's always interesting  he's funny and he's fun to have around and how cool is it you know you grow up watching kevin  smith's movies and now you realize that the radio show that you listen to i work for is a radio show 
[01:09:30]  that's friends with kevin smith pretty badass kevin smith on the countdown  what about star trek you see it yeah i didn't see it yet i just liked it right you weren't blown  away well as a huge star trek fan i kind of you notice things that are like why'd they do that  wait wait a minute they should have done that instead of that you know and just the use of 
[01:10:00]  the um transporter versus the shuttlecraft it's kind of like yeah well you know just beam that  shit what are you doing and also the like you know we all i i don't know how anyone didn't know  the moment they announced like we've got a villain yeah you've never heard of him before  you were like okay pretty spoilers it's probably going to be probably going to be their variation  of con which turned out to be yeah yeah yeah man of steel how much have you seen the tv spots uh i  saw that i saw that all the trailers there's a tv spot that they came out i've been talking about 
[01:10:30]  for a little while now about two three weeks ago the first tv spot i saw the shot in and it's a shot  of superman he's got lois laying in his arms and we're over his back and he's apparently rushing  away from something exploding some fucking danger and he's holding her so we're seeing the back of  his head and the front of her face because she's looking back over his shoulders and it might be her  performance it's got to be her performance hands down there you know the stuff that's in the frame  around them and the lighting and all that and you know obviously you get the impression like 
[01:11:00]  something horrible's happening and affects her at play but it really it all comes down to her  performance that performance in that one moment she's got these eyes on that's just like holy  fuck the worst thing that has ever happened it's like five feet from me and somehow unbelievably this  person is is flying me not running me not driving me flying me away from it such a great actress she  has everything playing across her face and makes you go like fuck fuck you take all my money like  that's the moment if you're a comic book reader that's whenever you think about the rescue which is a 
[01:11:30]  big part of comic book mythology like the somebody being there for you at that worst moment of your  life and being there like to save you man or woman it doesn't matter when you think about it that's  what you imagine because what they're usually rescuing you from you see batman swing and catch  somebody and whatnot shit's exploding them around them and you've never really seen it depicted in a  movie and just in that two seconds of the tv star i was really i was hooked in a big bed it looks  amazing if i can obviously effect wise just when you look at the old uh the old 1970 what was it 
[01:12:00]  78 78 you will believe a man can fly right right right and at the time that was amazing because  before that all he had was then the tv version would jump and then lay down and they'd blow  it was all superimposed and everything and that was like oh my god now though uh the great shots when  he goes supersonic and you just see that cone of fucking water of vapor uh you know that vapor trail 
[01:12:30]  coming off and his cape apparently every shot of his cape is cg wow really so they didn't yeah  because they were i guess zach snyder was like look man every time cape do that yeah you've got  a cape laying on a guy who looks kind of dopey no matter what they make it yeah he's like let's just  do it cg so every shot it's rippling and just they brought it to life no kidding when when does the  movie hit i think it's mid-june or something like that so we're almost there yeah it's it's not too  far away it's not this weekend i think it's the weekend and that leads to how does the man of steel  shave that's what you're what a hell of a segue yes that's why we get the big bug how does he 
[01:13:00]  shave.com that's where folks uh could go to right now when we're talking about with the man of steel  movie out the trailer out you see him with a beard at one point they see him with no beard so the good  folks at gillette uh came up with this thing of like how does he shave exactly they would be super  whiskers bingo now it's one of these things where a lot of people in comics or read comics like you  asshole we all know how he fucking shaves john byrne told us in 1986 so you know you go out there 
[01:13:30]  and you explain look this is for the mainstream people who maybe don't understand how was it  explained back in 1986 in 1986 and was that the year that was the year the man of steel miniseries  john byrne relaunches superman yeah uh recreates and takes lex luthor from a scientist in the purple  jumpsuit to donald trump essentially a businessman who is like metropolis's favorite son who hates  superman who shows that this alien shows up he becomes metropolis's favorite son this dude's like 
[01:14:00]  i hate him for that reason alone and so he starts crush trying to crush him on a corporate level  right more so than like i'm gonna create a giant spider and come after you so he reinvents uh john  byrne reinvents superman and one of the things he does is answer like dopey questions that for years  people who love comic books would ask and one was like how does he shave how does he shave and he  said john byrne said he has a mirror that he uses his heat vision on so he bounces his heat vision off 
[01:14:30]  the mirror to his face and then hits every strand and burns it off oh that's how he does it that's  how he does it in the fictional world because the character is not real but that's the answer that  they gave us many years ago and of course comic book people number one you'll accept any sort of  pseudoscience but number two john byrne said it so we're all like great like that's how he shaves  yeah i mean so can i go online and just say that's how he shaves you can but then people will say wow 
[01:15:00]  we're looking beyond that they wanted to disqualify that right all right so we're not doing that one  so i start mine by talking about that theory and whatnot and then go on like but here's my alternative  theory so they got me they got bill nye the science guy oh they got mayam bialik the the blossom who's  on big bang theory she's very and then they got the myth busters dude oh very cool and so they asked  all of us how does he shave we each got a theory and then you're supposed to vote them up i hope  everyone votes mine up mine is actually the one that makes the most sense what is yours logical my 
[01:15:30]  baby rocket theory i said the rocket that brought him to earth every permutation of the story is in  the rocket yes rocket comes from kryptonite strong enough so just bang off a piece of that metal  and he can hammer it out and that's what he would use to save some people talk about like  well and uh what was that movie um uh with uh will smith not hitch but the other superhero hancock  yeah hancock he shaved with a fingernail but i'm like that didn't make sense because i'm human being  and i can't shave with a fingernail like basically you take a power and augment it you can't magically 
[01:16:00]  give somebody the ability to do something that even with like relative to his strength  i know and you get tied up in this like that's not true and right the whole fucking thing's not  true yeah the whole flying thing would get me before how does he shave exactly a lot of people  have a little problem i like your uh i like your idea there that is a lot i listen to the rest right  what does bill nye say bill nye is uh he goes look in order to shave something down as you could  grind it down you just need something that's equally as powerful that would grind it down so 
[01:16:30]  if you like if you've got a stone you need another stone to grind it down if you grind it across each  other really hard but his theory doesn't say what that other element is right it's like we just have  to find an element of strong superman's beard it's got to be very strong he loses yeah i say that  begins with like uh you know there's she begins with a lie she goes they're doing uh research in the  field of kryptonian dna and genetics so that's horseshit like nobody's doing that anywhere yeah 
[01:17:00]  so hers is all about like uh since they're doing this they're going to come up with a cream that  you could rub in his face and it's just got low density kryptonite levels that make it all again  it's made up so that one i discount and then the myth busters they went through a few um one was  black hole theory which was like you know he just stands close to a black hole and lets it  suck his whiskers out take his eyeballs and everything else though when is wiener that is 
[01:17:30]  right right pubes yeah so i don't know honestly my theory is the only one yours makes perfect sense  scientifically sound go to how does he shave.com vote me up and and uh i don't win anything for  it just the moral right over blossom and and the myth busters and bill nye and it really would be  uh terrible if you uh didn't win this because you really are the expert as far as you you pointed out  the pink elephant in the room come on that's true if i don't win this what have i been doing for the  last 20 years right this is all i do you know blossom other people's movies yeah no one's gonna 
[01:18:00]  go hey blossom you didn't know she's a neuroscientist i know yeah she's got degrees crazy listen we got  to take a break are you sticking around today if you like me oh good kevin smith is here today  very good last time was quick it was in and out man how did the uh cartoon go it was lovely we had  such a good time nice crowd it was great theater awesome night yeah yeah awesome that's true we're still  out there and with uh jane silent bob super groovy cartoon movie you are yeah you're still  touring with that we do we come home and then we go back out this weekend we go to like pittsburgh

[01:23:30]  going to ask him and did he respond oh boy did he crispin glover proving that he is indeed the man  on the opian anthony show  you know it was actually very informative to me in some of the things that i'm i'm i'm talking about  uh in terms of propaganda i know it's a very beloved film uh but i i you know i was only in  the first film there was uh right yeah a uh uh they had uh taken the molds of my face from the 
[01:24:00]  um old age makeup from the original film and put a uh another actor into prosthetics that were made  from from from my face and uh and then interspiced a very small amount of footage of me from the  original film in order to fool audiences into believing that i was in the the movie i because  of my lawsuit there are rules in the screen actors guild that make it so producers uh can never do 
[01:24:30]  something like that again i'm proud of the lawsuit but oh wow the reason i i i i bring it up is because  the the reason that i didn't end up being in the film it's it's more complex than this but i i was  asking questions the there that the produce the producer's director didn't like right um i i actually  did work again with robert zemeckis strangely enough when i did bail wolf and had a very good  working relationship with him but there was a a different end in the original draft that i read for 
[01:25:00]  the screenplay i i when i auditioned for the part i was only given what are called sides the scene so i  got the part i was 20 years old i got the role my agent told me i'd gotten this part and i i didn't  really know everything about it and i said well maybe i i only knew that there's this other part  that i was the the scene i was doing the scene with i said well should i go in for this other part 
[01:25:30]  that seems like that could be a part he said no no you don't understand this is a really interesting  role you're going to be playing the older versions of this character in a different time here and i  thought wow that i said that's fantastic i said yeah great let's close the deal you know it's this big  universal studios produced by steven spielberg and uh directed by robert zemeckis so great so but you  know i was a serious actor as well so when i started actually analyzing the screenplay once we were  involved in the project i had questions about things and there was a different end i won't go into 
[01:26:00]  so many details about it but but i had questions about it and it it did get changed i think there are  other people that had questions because there are things in it that could particularly in this day  day be thought of as well offensive and and those changes happened it had to do with money and what  people were doing the the characters were doing with money but i didn't stop with it i said i said to  robert zemeckis i thought it was it was not a good idea for our characters to have a monetary uh reward 
[01:26:30]  because it basically makes the moral of the film be that money equals happiness and uh you know by  having the uh there were various things that were doing it but by having a son the son character  cheer by having a truck in in the garage i what i was arguing for was that it that the character  should be in love and that the the love should be the reward by having by by just by having any kind 
[01:27:00]  monetary element as a reward it makes it into a reward i and i i still feel the same way i i would  like the film a lot better if there was no monetary like there could be signs of maybe monetary change  would would happen but it was more important that the characters were in love i would feel much better  about the film but by having those monetary rewards in it it was uh it was a uh a propaganda and  zemeckis got really mad at me when i i said this and uh he yelled at you yeah yeah he yelled yeah 
[01:27:30]  it's kind of odd uh wow discussing a film that old at this point but but didn't you see at the end  the characters they were more in love i i think especially yeah that character and the wife that's  right seem to be but but my argument is that part was good i was right for it but i think it pollutes it  do you think the money could have been a peripheral effect of the happiness that they had that they  i think it's a bad message really i do i think it's a i think because that's propaganda that that says 
[01:28:00]  to people go out and and borrow money for banks this is this is a big part of why the film  was successful because bank the the corporations knew that it had that moral element in it maybe  maybe i i would also argue i mean that's only because they knew that that was in there  therefore they can feel comfortable in in funding it and and putting a lot of money into uh distributing  it maybe if that wasn't in there zemeckis and and and bob gale would have not have been able to sell 
[01:28:30]  it as readily i don't know but but what i but i what i would still argue is that if that wasn't in  there and the only part that was in there was that they were in love and that film still did get  distributed as highly as it had and have as much money behind it i still think the film would be  loved and it would be i think personally i think it would have a better moral why do you why do you  feel since the character in there wasn't crispin glover it was george mcfly yeah do you feel you have 
[01:29:00]  to uh inject part of your uh well i was 20 years old i was a young i was a young i was a young idealist  i i wouldn't do that now i wouldn't do that you wouldn't well i i mean i i right i i've  at that time i didn't even know it was like i just i i i'd done been in a few films but not that  many films and and i i'd been in acting class where we we did improvisations i came up with 
[01:29:30]  scenes and thoughts so i thought it was okay to be asking questions like that now i understand very  specifically that you know the there's a lot of money and and people have gone through a certain  amount of uh troubles in zemeckis i'm sure just asking us goddamn questions we're losing money here  by the day right well i mean to be fair i wasn't i wasn't stopping production we were we were we were  having a discussion during the time but uh but uh it's still uh yeah no i wouldn't i wouldn't do that 
[01:30:00]  now i fund my films with the working in corporate movies i wouldn't i i i know how things work at this  point why i was bringing to bring it up it was because it was informative to my my thought process  as to how propaganda does work because i had this very early experience and i was you know it it caused  me to not be in the sequels on some level i'm sure there's it's it's complicated but uh and then there 
[01:30:30]  is a lawsuit you know it's not an it was very specifically not a legal thing i mean you can  just say it's not a nice thing but it's not a legal thing to do uh either so this informed me that if  you if you question propaganda it has serious consequences what can i ask you when you mentioned  when you mentioned robert zemeckis when you talked to zemeckis about what you thought that should have  happened how long into your explanation did you realize he was not happy like did you did he listen 
[01:31:00]  to hear you out or did he interrupt you go look well well i you know it's a long time ago now i  remember the one one conversation very specifically but what i am forgetting is that there were two  there might have been two parts to the conversation because there was some part that i'm not going into  the detail about that was changed and it might be that then i continued on because they changed one  thing and i said but there's still this monetary aspect and so he probably was not happy about it  right they'd already done a change and i think i but i'm i'm forgetting now it was a that part was a 
[01:31:30]  while back but uh but you know but but it's also there's there's also a part when you're working on a  film that on some level not it doesn't happen every day but you do become passionate about things that  you want to get done it's normal for actors and directors not all all the time but it's relatively  normal to say look this is really important you you you speak it out passionately they speak it out  passionately and then you say okay that's fine then you shake hands and go but you can have  passionate sure conversations and it doesn't mean necessarily that it's going to turn into some 
[01:32:00]  terrible thing years later uh but but i mean and my my my experience in the business has been good  i that would be the one real exception that was wasn't good that was that was not a pleasant thing to  have happen because people still believe that that was me and and the reason i had the lawsuit  it was the real reason the primary reason that i had it was i just wanted people to know that i 
[01:32:30]  wasn't in there that wasn't you right i didn't if i had played that part i would have played it  differently right i didn't like the way that guy played it and people think that's me either well i i  mean you know i i i mean i i it's it's still it still gets to me that that that there's that that  confusion and i uh so what what's the what what way is there to let it be known other than than do  that so even still that's why whenever the issue anything about that spot up now i do talk about i'm 
[01:33:00]  talking about it more also because there's one one fellow he might have even been on your show i'm not  sure that bob gale yeah bob gale was on yeah i think i listened to it and he on your show he lied  he lied about something yeah and you guys automatically believed what he said oh man reconcile it please  what he said was that i had i'm just let me let me just make be specific and let me think he said that  i had asked for the same amount of money that michael j fox had was getting in the film it's it's total 
[01:33:30]  fabrication the reason that he's doing this is because he wants to throw the track off of of the  conversation of that what they had done was illegal so they're he's trying to justify as to why it was  good for them to do this illegal thing and and so then people automatically believe a oh i remember  what what he said specifically was that then i had called back after the thing was in production  saying oh i i want to do it or something somebody corroborated went oops or something like that i 
[01:34:00]  was like i didn't do that i was working i actually did work on a different film at the time a a john  borman film but it's it's uh what what happened in the negotiation was i i actually wanted to be in  the film uh but the uh the offer was less than half of what leah thompson and tom wilson who had similar  sized roles and it just it wasn't fair it was it my agents didn't think it was fair and and it was 
[01:34:30]  a sequel i got paid uh the same amount or more than what i was being offered for back to the future to  do this other film so it was just like a monetary and of course this was a gigantically well-grossing  film but but it's also why why did they do that it's because i had i read a great book i recommend  anybody read called how to win friends and influence people by dale carnegay i only read it 
[01:35:00]  like in the uh 2000s i wish i'd read it when i was like a teenager but but the one of the things that  he really illustrates well is don't prove people wrong and that's essentially what i was doing when  i was having that argument with zemeckis about that there was a moral issue here i was just thinking  i was being like this you know it was a good moral of what i was arguing for and i thought they'd see  my point you know yeah but but but but i realized on some level that i was and especially with a  lawsuit i proved people wrong when you do something like that then they come on the opian anthony show 
[01:35:30]  and make a lot of stuff about you and make up things oh my god well we just assumed he was  yeah yeah yeah which i think a lot of people do he was lying but you guys are like no it's not  what do you think of uh steven spielberg well first off robert zemeckis i think can make interesting  films i you know i i i the second film that i did with him uh um beowulf which was written by neil 
[01:36:00]  guyman and roger ivory uh i thought had very good moral uh elements and it was about lies which i  have a lot of interest in and and they they did something very interesting with that film i think  zemeckis can get into a dark uh dark comedic territory that's that's very interesting i liked  what death becomes her and uh and you know he's he can be be interesting i i tend toward feeling like 
[01:36:30]  steven spielberg really does work very much in propaganda and and and it's it's very well  hidden uh like i was saying a little bit about kind of war um if you analyze steven spielberg's  films about war they're essentially pro-war films and i i i i don't think that's good at this point in  time to do you look at a great war film like all quiets on the western front 
[01:37:00]  or paths of glory by kubrick or uh full metal jacket by kubrick they all are questioned it's  obviously not proper happy ideas about war these are highly questioning that war is not there's no  question war is a horrible thing and you look at something like saving private ryan which is a very  well-liked film but essentially it's arguing that there's such a thing as a moral war a good war  and you maybe you can make that argument i just think it's a bad argument to make especially at 
[01:37:30]  this point in time i don't think that i just i wouldn't want to do that i've just i don't understand  why somebody in power a power situation like that is is making films that are are saying it's good to  be going to war why do that what's why right i mean i i i'm sure there's all kinds of people  veterans and things that my father's a veteran my father was in the korean war you know but it was 
[01:38:00]  like i he very explained very clearly to me when the vietnam war was going on i was a kid i saw those  awful images i my father said to me war was horrible you know it's like he was he didn't have any like  glory stories about being being in the war and he was in bad situations so i i just i i maybe i'm  a bleeding heart pacifist but i just i just think it's it's not good to be making pro-war films so i  i question and spielberg and spielberg is a powerful man that doesn't need the money so i think your 
[01:38:30]  point is he could he could take all that power yes and and do a more positive message i could argue  that that private ryan though was uh it did show a lot of the horrors of sure of of war yeah but it's  still but still when you analyze it somehow there's a positive element about about aspects  of the war and i just i don't think it's a good message to put out which is my similar argument  with with back to the future sure yeah there there there are interesting elements in back to the 
[01:39:00]  future the structure is excellent it's all it's part of why the it's part of why i had strong  arguments because i could see what that moral element was and i knew it would have uh i knew it  have effect within the culture or i felt it would yeah and so uh when you analyze those things it's  like you've got a lot of money you've got a lot of power do something that's going to genuinely affect  the culture at large in a very positive uh way and i i just i don't i suppose i'm sure i would assume 
[01:39:30]  steven spielberg feels like he was doing something positive i i would argue that it would be much  more positive if it was a clear anti-war message you ever think though sometimes that there there  are you know there's filet mignon and then there's a steak from your freezer like some things are just  made yeah to be you can argue it but but i'm really tasting it i i can't help but be be analytical  it's just my nature obviously and and when you look overall at you know our culture it's easy to study 
[01:40:00]  something like soviet russia or nazi germany and and condemn those things rightfully so but  terrible things went on in those cultures with propaganda but it's more difficult for our culture  to analyze our own propaganda especially in the media uh but i think it's important to do it and  because i think i think our our culture's media is much more well-oiled than even soviet russia or  or nazi germany because people don't notice it and and so things like saying well it's just this is 
[01:40:30]  a fun movie or all that you know there there is i enjoy movies that i'm sure would be strong  propaganda as well just because something's propaganda doesn't mean it's not a good movie  but but i think it's really important to have the discussion so that people are aware of this and i  don't really see the see the discussion happening in our uh specifically about film which is what i'm  most passionate about it it happens in in other areas a little bit about politics and things like 
[01:41:00]  that but you know i i just i again as this young idealist when i was 16 i wanted to be a part of  this industry that was questioning things i'd like it to come back now do you think there's a director  out there kind of in the mainstream that's doing it right i think i think there are a lot of directors  that are passionate and want to do it and any any films that were pretty popular that you're like yes  they're doing it right that's a positive message for our culture maybe maybe i i i hesitate to to  point to things but there are there are i can tell there's some directors working in the corporate 
[01:41:30]  industry that are striving really hard and every once in a while they do there is a film that will  come out and and that asks questions for real and and is artful and anytime a director is stuck with  it and done it i stand up and applaud i mean it's an amazing feat do you want to mention one  well the ones i more think of are not big popular popular films i very much like aspar noe's enter the  void but that's not you know a big huge popular film i thought that was a really well made uh film 
[01:42:00]  i i see things that happen in in the the corporate films that there's some there are some very good  directors that i'd love to work with uh but but it's i i get nervous about getting into putting  examples because then people can easily say well this film did this and this and i might agree with  them so because i can see that even when somebody's really striving hard uh maybe there are reasons  why it didn't go as hard as it could have gone understand but i but i mean again i'm i'm so glad 
[01:42:30]  to be a part of the industry and i want to work with people i don't want to be it's it's difficult for  me to talk like this because i feel like i feel like so many people are friends with spielberg or  zemeckis i think i'm i'll never work with this guy he's a jerk i'm sure nobody in this room is  friends with those guys believe me well i i i i well i but about like uh bob gale was on the show  so it's like it does it does happen and and i it's well you set the record straight today i'm glad  i'm glad and we apologize for that you know it's not it's not you didn't have your phone number 
[01:43:00]  it's not yeah i mean why why why wouldn't uh people uh think something's true but the re the  reason i i i point to it specifically is he was involved in something that you know i've seen even  when i use the word illegal uh that people go oh drama queen but very specifically i saw somebody write  those words tattooed over my ass but very specifically uh you know i it was illegal and 
[01:43:30]  and so if some and he was a prime architect of that illegal activity so so there's a motive to  make something uh seem uh you know like it was it was justified to do this and that's why he's he's  saying these things should have just looked at him and just said now don't con me bob  yeah i mean i you know i mean he's the he he's he said a lot of things it's not just that there are 
[01:44:00]  negative things that have been said to me and then about me on the blu-rays that are are not true  and uh oh a commentary really yeah yeah he said things that are like i mean i i haven't listened  to it all in completion myself but i've had people come up and say did this this and this i said where  did you hear that and they said on the on the commentary on the blu-ray for back to the future and  and uh it's always from him i i it's not from robert zemeckis it's not i mean steven spielberg  doesn't comment at all but but but anything is bob gale still is that's his main um career at this 
[01:44:30]  point as well he he doesn't really write films uh anymore he's not involved in the industry other  than having to do with uh things having to do with back to the future so i think the fact that there  was this lawsuit and uh he he has a lot of focus specifically on that uh film series he has a  lot going on in his mind about it specifically that there was an illegal action and that was it's in the 
[01:45:00]  public record so yeah it has to justify it is just an odd thing that that movie did become so beloved in  american uh well and and part of it is is part of it is that there are good structural elements there  are interesting things in it uh and unfortunately that element there are other movies that that in  the you you history of u.s filmmaking that do similar elements with their structure where it seems as 
[01:45:30]  though it's about love but there's a there's a monetary reward and they're very popular films i think a lot  of people see it though as uh boy who wouldn't want to go back in time and change things for the  better when you then come back and you're like wow i fixed i fixed it that part's great yeah that part  that that's a big part of why it's and that's that's what's also is my my argument about it's like all  this stuff is great why do you need to put this this this monetary reward in it it would it would make 
[01:46:00]  it such a a more pure message of love instead of instead of uh you know dirtying it up with uh with  a messy uh element you'd rather seen a 67 falcon in that garage i i would have rather not that that  didn't happen i would have just rather that there was uh you know and there were the the the scene was  also reshot you know there was a different actor playing the part originally uh eric stoltz originally 
[01:46:30]  played the part and then uh michael j fox replaced him we had already shot the the sequence that i'm  i'm talking about the alternate future and i had played it slightly differently and then they fired  back to eric stoltz and uh i thought i was going to get fired as well uh but we robert zemeckis made it  very clear that he wanted me to play it quite uh relatively different than i i had played it 
[01:47:00]  originally and i at the point that we shot the alternate uh uh future um the second time when we  shot that scene i was basically i would call it acting from the spinal cord i was i was afraid i was  i was genuinely really oh yeah i thought i was going to get fired if i didn't do exactly what what what  they said i didn't want you know i was again i was 20 i didn't want to get fired i wasn't looking  for controversy i wanted to do a good job how would you have liked to have seen that ending play out  if you had say the only thing was that i didn't think there should have been monetary 
[01:47:30]  the what the kind of clothes we were so when they okay that's what i was getting into so when they walk  in uh they've been playing tennis yeah and and they have nice clothes on like all that was i i i i i thought it  just it was it all pointed toward this idea that happiness was about wealth it made me really  uncomfortable what i was wearing holding a tennis record i did it because i thought i was going to  get fired but i i vocalized that i didn't think this was a good idea and i think there's even might 
[01:48:00]  be some commentary on the blu-ray about where they said oh crispin didn't like his clothes i didn't care  about i didn't care about the clothes it was like i cared about the message and and so and so that was  a very specific message i you know i didn't write again i wouldn't do it now obviously i wouldn't make  that complaint now i i i would have looked at the the whole screenplay i would have analyzed what was  going on i would have known okay there's this element of propaganda and i'll maybe i'll say something 
[01:48:30]  and if they don't want to do it fine but i i i i was you know 20 years old is really quite young  you just don't understand how compelling this is for me to ask you sure i'm glad to talk about it  no i was just wondering like because i think i think the happiness and and how do you show success  he went from being you know the goofy kind of loser guy yeah being very successful because of what  happened in that moment well i mean i mean how do you how do you show the success part there's a lot 
[01:49:00]  a million ways you can do it i mean i mean but but we're not it can it could take days to really  sit and figure out exactly what it is i i i it's not something that i'm prepared to to say exactly  what the illustration of it would be i'm sure there would be a uh cinematic illustration of of  love and uh success that that would work and i i don't have that answer at this moment and was it 
[01:49:30]  odd that biff would be around the house at all seeing what he did well see that that that's part  of what the change was from what i originally read in the screenplay there were different people  it wasn't biff that was the servant to the the the family oh and and i had questions about it and and  it did get they have slaves or something i i don't want to i don't want to go into a lot of detail but  that's the first thing i thought of when you said i i know well i i don't want to go into a lot  i am actually in the i'll write it down in a book at some point i'd love to read it the worst of the

[01:55:30]  realize was that the people that he was making fun of have all the same beliefs that one anthony  cumia from opie and anthony do so anthony's watching him like this fucking asshole anthony  and jim brewer get into a big fight about it i mean not a fight but an argument a debate  about gun control and whenever you get two guys that are as smart and that are as hilarious as jim  brewer and anthony cumia debating about anything it's must listen radio here they are you must listen 
[01:56:00]  that's why i don't even watch i don't watch the news it's so it's yeah it's like gun laws i mean  if you everyone should have a right to have a gun i think a gun that's a gun yeah  that's a suspect exactly that's what i said suspect unless you're in the military or you're hunting 
[01:56:30]  there's no reason for that no one could have a you can't have a machine gun and at the end of the day  this is the news they'll say i i would sit some of my friends are so fox news oriented it drives me  this is how the nazis did what are you talking about like no the last i heard the nazis would  knock at the door like does your name endenstein they're not looking like what are you talking 
[01:57:00]  about or or they'll say i i get so around i i i feel bad for people when they go well it's the  constitutional right like are you retarded yep they wore fucking wigs and tights when they wrote  up the constant it took 40 minutes on a guy on a fucking horse to shoot somebody there were no cars 
[01:57:30]  you had to get on a horse you had a puck fucking gunpowder and stick it in there chase this fucker  which fixing your wig because the the bouncing of the horse was fucking your wig up then you had  to fix your tights and then the gum would go up by accident and it took another 20 minutes  to fucking get this guy to reload so that whole not and and then there's and they go well  what are the you know our government's taking over that that argument makes me absolutely 
[01:58:00]  it is an asshole argument it's beyond an asshole argument like did you watch boston did you see  what happened when the so-called bomber which is another fucking thing the bomber  dude all right i'm gonna get started here for 24 straight 24 straight hours uh they go i am it  here comes the swag truck and there's 14 swag people and they show the same video of the fucking 
[01:58:30]  watcher and here's the dog and they and then they would have the helicopters and i sat there  watching going oh man they got those heat-seeking helicopters it's over and then like okay well  running over here and then they're running over here i don't know what's going on over there but  they're all going over there there's the helicopter it's circling up it's been 24 hours he was shot in 
[01:59:00]  the juggler how do you get shot in a fucking neck the dogs can't sniff you out nobody can find but my  kid comes out of the pool with a stubbed toe and i can see where this little fucking yo-yo went all  the way into the bedroom not the blood not cleaning off their toe like i could see you came out of the  pool you fucking stubbed your toe here you walk all the way to the new carpet into your fucking  bedroom and then the bed i can see your stupid stubbed toe this guy's hitting the juggler 
[01:59:30]  and the dog there are going more slot games and more dogs and they're and they're fucking no one's  allowed to have she like old people coming out of the house and they're like get down  my dog has to shoot my dog get back in the house you can be a suspect my dog get down  they got an old lady and she's down on the floor and i got the m16s to her face 
[02:00:00]  yeah and then okay and then they show the same video here's them walking around the corner again  obviously the younger guy is following the older brother he's obviously the leader let's look at  that video one more time for the 1700 000 time here's the older brother there's a younger brother  here's the older brother is a younger brother this is moments before the bomb no one has these 
[02:00:30]  fucking guys dropping a bomb walking away but they got 18 million videos of walking around a corner  no other fucking video then they let it all go okay we're releasing it we can't find him he's in  the boat in the backyard does anyone watch fucking cops like he said wasn't even it was straight as  it ran up back here every cops video is like ah he's under the fucking pool he's under the raft he's 
[02:01:00]  under a bush all right i'm not gonna get into that what i'm getting to is the whole that's very  suspect when people when i watch that that made me again look at yo-yos that are into like you can't  take my guns away because the government takes over so the government's gonna take over and you're  gonna hold them off did you see what happened in boston you fucking retard yeah mr educated watch 
[02:01:30]  fox news 24 7 with your with your degree oh you know that's going on this country really oh okay  your m16 is gonna hold off that fucking army army that was just one town and at the end of the day if  you're that packed it's gonna be some kid is 18 going like this on a computer okay mission accomplished  sir and you're gonna be sitting there with your whole arsenal going do you hear bottle rocket 
[02:02:00]  the hell sounds like a buck  making accomplished  and then the other stupid thing is uh what were they i was just listening to this three days ago at  someone's house and i just i'm silent because i just watch these idiots argue with each other  and they don't even it's not even common sense it's just watching news if you watch fox news  it's the nbc they teach you how to argue each other they teach you how to argue each other there's 
[02:02:30]  no common sense well let's go to ask me on the one hand you got this opinion and on the other hand  you have this opinion and in this opinion and grit so you're already going yeah i feel it yeah that's  how i feel you fucking morons that's how i feel that's exactly exactly all right answer that question  and so then this is the element gets me nuts well china is going to take over and this is what if 
[02:03:00]  we're taking over if america's taken over can you imagine god forbid we're taken over taken over  invaded oh wow okay we're invaded they got past our amazing intelligent military that found the  fucking boston bomber 24 hours by a neighbor wasn't even military to find him the fucking neighbor  said i think there's some blood gushing out the boat i should say he was even saying there's some 
[02:03:30]  fat there's some blood out on the back out on the backyard well however the fucking boston people talk  i think you might want to look into that if if some red liquid's coming out of my boston whale  someone's fucking with my whale in the yard my dog's licking the outside of my whale  just got blood all over i ain't seen no dead rabbits 
[02:04:00]  and so if you're sitting there our intelligence our amazing military that was all over that  couldn't stop that couldn't catch them yeah they can't stop whoever's going to infiltrate us  then our local police force takes over they can't stop them do you think jed in tennessee  and bob in jersey with your thank god for the gun law i got my tony on long island 
[02:04:30]  yeah tony on long island gonna stop me  fum duck fum duck and vladimir and whoever who's just already crushed everyone  this ain't red dawn in the night they say patrick swayze ain't gonna help you you retards  people are retarded when they watch the fucking news so anyway i don't know how i got into that  they're uh very funny well i do have a couple of responses please please do have a couple of 
[02:05:00]  responses please uh and and of course i i don't think there's anyone in their right mind that would  assume that a bunch of people with whatever weapons are legally available to uh the american public  these days can can fend off the united states military correct i never thought that i don't think that's  actually the point correct what i think the point is is that an armed public cannot be taken over 
[02:05:30]  with a swipe of the the pen uh in in more of a figurative term but here it is you're not looking  to defeat the united states army with your your guns at home sure but yes if the united states military  and the government leading that military knows it has to fire upon its people because its people will  shoot back at them uh-huh it it it negates the country the country's gone at that point 
[02:06:00]  so then what is the government actually holding on to at that point you know what i mean you can't  open fire on a huge number of american people because they're shooting back at you now if the american  people have no weapons it's very easy to just legislate your your uh um will upon them and and uh take  away people's rights and whatnot it's not winning the thing is if you even get into a battle with the 
[02:06:30]  american people you lose you instantly lose you you've lost the country you've lost everything  the country supposedly supposedly stands for uh-huh and and there's no more free united states of  america and there is one now i know you can you can you can talk about what it is now and everything  i understand that i don't think it's free now either and i think and i think they can legislate  against you in small pockets of resistance like waco and whatnot boston yes you can smooth it over and  say well these are individual things on a large scale on a large scale where where where a tyrannical 
[02:07:00]  american government wants to completely take over uh in in some way i don't know what it would be  but you cannot make that huge leap to you know mission accomplished you can't do that and then  and then have people show up at disney world the next day like nothing happened you know what i  mean it it takes shut up really that's a goofy argument it is not a goofy argument it's a goofy 
[02:07:30]  argument it's a goofy argument it is not a goofy argument at the end of the day what are you saying  i still don't even understand what you're saying what i'm saying is an armed people population okay  we don't have guns yeah this country okay everyone that's on this country is yes yes legally okay  you got arms i got arms okay i got that now what i believe it is a deterrent to the government  just invoking its will on the people without no no no 
[02:08:00]  entity you really think yeah let's say let's say you've got a tank let's say you've got uh  armored vehicle personnel or whatever yes you have a nuclear warhead uh-huh in your fucking garage  sure you really think at the end of the day someone in washington's going listen it's time  for takeover but keep away from that anthony from the ona show because he's got too many weapons 
[02:08:30]  no it never goes to the gets to that point so what is it never gets to it's a deterrent it's almost a  like someone's got a dog and i don't want to go in that house because they got a dog it's an  uneven detente where it's a balance of power based on the fact that if anything happens  it it negates what we are right now it it eliminates this country of ours if if the united states military  starts if firing on american people who are firing back at the military on a level much bigger than 
[02:09:00]  waco then but that doesn't have to happen because you don't understand what i'm saying i don't know  it's really pretty far-fetched it is not far-fetched you're talking about fucking communism  you're talking about like pure russian military oh my god what hey look it's the fourth of july parade  no it's not welcome to america  oh my god they're shooting on us i thought it was a i thought it was a float what happened to america 
[02:09:30]  they took our they took our guns away that's what happened it's goddamn nazism all over like you're  you're so far-fetched in what you're saying no it's not far-fetched because yes it is it's crazy  it's lunacy what you're saying i'm not even saying what's lunacy it's lunacy you're saying  more lunacy shit thinking the government uh is gonna have some 18 year old in a fucking 
[02:10:00]  shipping container launching drone attacks on on cities that's that people have fucking  that's that's lunacy that's more action movie shit than me saying that people the knowledge  that the american people have over 300 million guns in their possession you ever see the videos  you ever see the videos of like iraq war when they're on the ships yes what do you think  that's a guy packing a fucking missile and if that's a guy in a computer going  i know that i think you're missing my point i think a lot of people are no i think a lot of 
[02:10:30]  people know exactly what i'm talking about there is a there is it's simple there is a deterrent  yes alone in the knowledge that the american people yeah are armed regardless if they're armed  with fucking muskets or blow guns or anything else there's a deterrent there to know but no  one cares if you gotta get like i don't care if you got a gun we're talking about  crazy semi-automatic uh what's the difference between assault rifles assault rifle 
[02:11:00]  is a semi-automatic gun like a hunting rifle there's nothing different right i'm talking  like you can't own one you can't own a machine gun in this country you shouldn't there's no  reason there's already a law there's no reason i know but again why can't i have why why can't i  go out right now in new york state yes and buy a semi-automatic ar-15 uh and and and take it to  the range because you get fucking wasted or or you or someone finds it it's just it's a deadly 
[02:11:30]  fucking one here's the other one here's the other one well then you gotta stop cars and we should take  cars away yeah fucking retard argument right it's all madness dude it's it's the it's the thought  process that you really think it's going to deter anything that that i think starts insulting  intelligence well then i think the bigger insult is the thought process thinking taking guns away 
[02:12:00]  from uh people oh yeah try to buy that try to buy that why would i want to no it's not yes it is  one of my kids find it one of the retard kids across the street find it what are you leaving it laying  around like a rake you gotta be what's called responsible but people aren't you want a car  with a car you gotta be in trouble with a car you do but people aren't that's the problem but you have 
[02:12:30]  to be with a car but you're not you're letting people drive you're letting irresponsible people  get into cars to drive and kill many more people than guns now you laugh at that you laugh at it but  it's the same argument you're making okay oh they leave their keys around for their 16 year old to  jump in and drive away well why do you leave your kids in your purse because no one takes a car and  purposely drives into a school and mows them the fuck down and you know what on on a statistical level  it's very rare statistics all right so when your kid is killed you let me know how that statistic 
[02:13:00]  works all right how about the fucking dumbest thing how about the six kids in chicago that were  fucking shot over the weekend that no one even gave a shit about because we're that used to it  now like oh more kids killed is that it what are you arguing for what do you what what are you  like barking for what do you want you just want machine guns i i want the ability okay to live my  fucking life the way i want you have it no i don't you got 50 you got i want to buy another one of those  you got it great i want to buy another one of those to a country where you can get one i guess i can't 
[02:13:30]  why not because they figured out the rest of the world figured out oh my god stop it the rest of  the world figured out what that when you have savages are killing people all over the world  hey how about that a lot less fucking sophisticated than that and you know what the people that kill  us here are nice young educated people they're not savages oh they're wackos playing drugs most of  or they had problems or they grew up in a bad home they're not savages no most of them are gang 
[02:14:00]  savages and that's where all the homicides come from there's a small portion that are those crazy  white kids that shoot up to schools and that's what the news picks up on but it's not romantic and fun  enough when it's just gang bangers shooting grandma for a piece of crack or shooting at his body from  three feet away and hitting three 12 year olds what yeah take it they shouldn't have it  fucking take it away they shouldn't have it take it away they shouldn't have it right yeah so what's 
[02:14:30]  the problem the problem is uh they like fireworks i'm annoyed that i can't light off m80s anymore  that bothers me but because some retard blew his fucking hand off or let his kid get way he got  wasted and the kid blew it up that fucked up fourth of july i think we still enjoy fourth of july  every year now i gotta travel to a fucking river to watch it for 20 hours and then take me nine  hours to get home but we still have fourth of july it's no fucking difference no difference too many 
[02:15:00]  retards fucked it up the guy across the guy in my general neighborhood yeah his kids came walking  around the neighborhood with bullets strapped around and with one of his guns it's like he  should have been arrested should have been but he wasn't he should have been fucking arrested  which proves to the point we we just we can't take control of it so when we can't take control of it 
[02:15:30]  you're not allowed to play oh stop you're fucked you think that every everyone should be based on the  lowest common denominator and what they can or can't fucking handle and that's how we should take it  away well you know what maybe sometimes you get up on stage not maybe you'll say shit that offends  people sure or makes people do things or influences people so why don't we just take what you say  and throw that out the fucking window too brewer what's i get to do it it's the same thing someone 
[02:16:00]  no it makes no sense it it you're saying that because some people can't handle certain things  yes that everyone can't have murder weapons i don't have a murder weapon i don't have a weapon i can  destroy and kill somebody oh we could argue that you're fucking uh influence you're very influential  your speech is very influential okay and look out you might influence people to hurt homosexuals or  negroes at the end of the day yeah are you upset just with guns in general or that you can't get a  machine gun i like no no i i don't need a machine gun i i want to like it i like a good semi-automatic 
[02:16:30]  you know it when you pull the trigger every one okay one bullet flies out the other end for target  and then i like having other weapons that i use for self-protection yes which is uh i kind of like  the idea that it puts you on equal footing with some thug that might want to do you bodily harm  yeah i i'm with you there a hundred percent someone busts in your door i'm sure if someone kicks in  your door the first thing you're gonna think is i wish i had a gun hey i'm not gonna lie to you 
[02:17:00]  someone came over my house he he showed me his gun he's like listen i travel everywhere with a gun  i need to let you know i have a gun in your house oh that's nice i said okay what let me see because  listen it's in a case blah blah blah and he showed it to me and i'm not gonna lie um my wife every  night gives me a fucking uh false alarm someone's breaking in  and sometimes i get worried because i know the golf club or the bat just ain't gonna do it 
[02:17:30]  yeah with with a bullet facing my torso that's true yeah so this one night while they were sleeping  over oh i swear to god slept like a baby i would no i i got woken up in the middle of the night  someone's hustling the front door what some i know i hear someone trying to get in the front door  this is every other month it was the first time in my life i just got up with no fear 
[02:18:00]  walk to the front door and even ask who it was i just opened the front door knowing they may get me  but my kids are safe because right next to them is some weapons that are going to put major holes in  these people right yeah or deter them yeah i don't have a problem with with that right it's it's sort of  like playing a game with rules all right we all have a rules to this game however as much as steroids 
[02:18:30]  baseball whatever yeah all right we obviously whoever's making the rules up yeah aren't sticking  to them and it's it's turning into bad shit yeah here and there even if this percentage is small  even it's blah blah blah and it's fucking things up for you who should have the right to go certainly i go  to a range it's like this guy he goes to range when i went to the range this guy had a um he had 
[02:19:00]  it looked like a smith and wesson but it was it sounded like a cannon and he warned us he went hey  listen he was a huge guy he went hey listen i'm shooting off uh i don't even assault right he said  it's assault but it was a pistol wow and this thing literally it was so loud even with the with the  headphones on i had a hole it was probably the 50 caliber yeah anyway and flames came out the end 
[02:19:30]  and the and the um what do you call it the the target would just explode like feathers getting  a pigeon getting blown up and and you can see his boner and i don't i would have one too  and my daughter i have to say she was shooting and she was a beast and she turned to me and she  went i really like that feeling of power it's just uh i it's fun to shoot i yeah but the average 
[02:20:00]  citizen need that i mean oh jimmy just then correct jimmy's an asshole right so but who was at the  front door who's at the front who was at the front door her imagination i figured as much but i needed  to know imagination who was at the front you left us with it and i opened the door i like your analogy  though with uh sports and there has to be rules and things like that i understand the rule factor  but here's what happens imagine playing a game where you're adhering to the rules right but there's 
[02:20:30]  people on the other team that aren't paying attention to any rules and there's they're not  penalizing those people every time someone doesn't pay attention to the rules they go to the people  that are paying attention and give them more rules so now in new york household if i'm in my house  and my kids i go listen no no fritos no snacks after seven o'clock right okay seven o'clock any snacks 
[02:21:00]  you're gonna get punished you you you're screwed right no no ipads no instagram and no email no nothing  okay now when i'm not around i go upstairs and this little fucker's sneaking i said where'd you get  that well mom said mom said hey did we not go well she did do her homework and then two weeks later  there's ants infested in her bedroom and the cat has fleas because the fucking bugs from the fritos 
[02:21:30]  yeah that she ate in the bed and i go this is why i don't want fritos in here and then it happened  three times and then i go you know what no more fucking fritos period because i'm tired of people  fucking with the rules everyone's fucked so there it's up to the people and i tell the sisters i go  listen i don't care which one of you fuckers do it one of you fuck up you're all screwed that gives 
[02:22:00]  an incentive for the other ones to go uh don't bring your fritos out there i'm gonna tell dad that  might work in the brewer debt in the brewer dictatorship yes that's where you live in yes well  fritos someone's eating the fritos in bed and no one's but i have a right to bear fritos  yes you cannot take that away from me yes you do and no one's gonna come in and take them at the  if you got the fritos in your house they're in your house tough shit they're in there already 
[02:22:30]  from here on now it literally should be like sit down what's your name where you from first of all  the way you look you gotta go home it's already out you're already you're already out  the worst of the week countdown continues here we are you made it to number one on the worst of the  week countdown highlighting all the worst meaning best moments on the opian anthony show my name is  sam roberts you can hear me every morning on ona uh and on after opian anthony live as the host but  uh you have made it unless you're just now tuning in in which case listen to the replay this show 
[02:23:00]  replays all weekend unless it's late at night sunday in which case it might not be replaying again  because it's late at night sunday we got shows to do monday we're live number one this week  diamond david lee roth how could he not be he's the quintessential rock star he came back  on the opian anthony show i dare say he's back and better than ever diamond dave shows us how it's done 
[02:23:30]  here on the worst of the week countdown  number one don't hurt yourself an entire generation and a half launching themselves  off the top of uh toyota land cruisers trying to touch their toes you can hear the the the belts  popping pop up i would come out after a show yeah and you would invariably see uh there would be a 
[02:24:00]  pickup truck festooned with beer cans every single space that you could get a vertical empty beer can  on in fact vertical empty beer can that sounds like a bandit coach hell it is and uh they would  have it covered and somebody would get on the bumper there'd be three gals three guys and they  launched themselves off the toe was that you jay did you ever try that all the time jump off the bumper  you know and try and touch their toes and somebody go no that's not how you do it and clear off the  hood you know and you hear the beer cans and he climb up and launch and land in a heap much to the 
[02:24:30]  glee you know of the uh derision and ridicule of the crowd and somebody would do it from the top  yeah until somebody snapped a leg probably they've told the best story on my podcast about van halen  trying to expand their parameter expand the parameters he said like when you're a kid you  have bunk beds do you remember this whole thing you said oh sure it was a mate we go ahead do it and  i'll help you along let's see what you remember from it when you're a kid you have bench uh bunk beds  you put them a little farther apart and you go hey uh let's see if we can make it this far apart 
[02:25:00]  from this bunk bed to that bunk bed uh-huh and then the whole band's like oh you know what put the  bunk bed against the wall i'm eddie i can do it better than dave i can do better than alex and my  put all the way across the wall the ground is lava if you touch the lava you're out hot lava you call  it yes you have two bunk beds people say dave why i'm in the middle of a really good story  i tried to get you to tell it i never got tired of doing that you have two bunk beds my sister 
[02:25:30]  slept in when i was in the other and you would jump across one of the other and go hot lava hot lava  and you didn't want to fall in but well you start off with a foot in between  and then of course they try to up the ante put it two feet apart you go hot lava  and my career has been kind of the same based on that ever since the beginning you know farther and  farther apart how far away can we move and still uh survive how what can we do musically that's  going to push the advantage a little bit more what can we try on stage you know what can we do on  the album cover this time that's farther and farther inevitably you're going to fall into the hot 
[02:26:00]  to the hot lava yeah yeah and that's your best drinking story the record company comes in like  with you know for we got ideas for this album you guys could maybe take it in this direction and  day was like no you don't understand we've already had the beds  one outside and we jumped from the second story window so uh move synthesizer what the fuck are  you talking about we're already up to uh out the window off the wall against the board  it'd be really great if you guys could do a little more melody hooks that'd be great 
[02:26:30]  some hooks we ran into that routinely you know it's like in the doors movie where the guy goes  herman's hermits let me just say two words herman's hermits that's music oh wow yeah yeah a lot of  people try to influence what you do um musically i'm sure over the years well it's vicarious it's  vicarious you know when you say uh party like a rock star who do you think they're talking to  you know you're talking to the rock star you assholes when a girl says fuck me like a rock star who do you 
[02:27:00]  think she's talking about diamond dave not michael anthony well you could ask just about anybody in  showbiz and otherwise and politics would you like to be diamond dave 1985 august go and they'll answer  yeah of course are you kidding i just said when dave was uh sitting here party like a rock star and all  this i realized just this moment there are no bands that sound like van halen there never has been  a band like when you listen to oasis they sound like the beatles when you listen to the black crows 
[02:27:30]  they sound a little like zeppelin there's never been a band where you go that's kind of a van halen  who came uh close you think to sounding like van halen well there's a variety of bands who had  old school roots we're a 70s band we enjoyed our success in the 80s but uh if you look back in the  stones okay and the zeppelins etc that's a combination of different neighborhoods you follow  there's some downtown there's some jazz there's some latino mixed in there and that's what made up  van halen there's no magic to it at all we had to play a lot of different neighborhoods you had to  play a biker neighborhood that's born to be wild you're going to play south of the harbor freeway 
[02:28:00]  that's going to be santana change your evil ways you know and and and surf well they wanted aerosmith  and you mix all of that learn to work everything in the kitchen and no matter what you want kid  pick a noodle choose a sauce we're good yeah they learned like a hundred that's a way of describing  oh he learned they had to learn like a hundred no i know covers just to go up i know he told us last  time just amazing i wasn't here that time and you flipped it so what kind of music is it i don't 
[02:28:30]  know i mean you know i wrote a few half of every song and i'm not sure what what is jamie's grind  what's dance the night away what is jump these are like hybrid you know helen songs yeah but  when you look under the hood you go wow italian viscous coupling and but these uh tires they're uh  kind of faintly from uh we're another country and you know you mix and match all that that's what  made all your favorite bands have you heard a band that has come close to sound like you like  you'll hear like you jace that you hear bands that sound like that no i know but that's what i  know why am i yelling at you i don't understand phrasing you and quoting you and giving you full 
[02:29:00]  credit for it everyone around you you're not you're not you're not okay we come from we came from  theory and orchestration we went to professional music schools we did and then we took a left and kept  on going you know we completely down sounded so they got a balance there between the you because uh eddie  had quite a unique guitar sound and you obviously vocally had a very unique uh vocal style so to  to get that to happen again somewhere else ah well you have to play the 5 45 minute sets a night  you know i don't know where those clubs are i know where there's occasional jam night you know i know 
[02:29:30]  where there's a great comedy club tonight david's uh levittown governor i'm gonna be so you play the  big rooms i like to cobble them together 200 at a time let me ask you a question though can you do  what you do like in in a madison square garden we've seen comics humor folks humorists go into  giant arenas i want to ask you as professionals can you really pull that off i believe absolutely  yeah but for me like the whole 17 000 person thing would irritate me so i'd prefer to do it with 
[02:30:00]  about 180 200 people which is my normal fucking sales yeah just to kind of scatter them around the  arena let them enjoy the space can you play jazz in a giant place i don't think so no there's too  many levels there's too many i think what for what uh what we do if the best part even for my kind of  rock and roll with the uh with the brothers is where you can see eyebrows and faces once you can't see  eyebrows anymore you get starts to get impersonal just draw the line right there you aren't seeing 
[02:30:30]  fucking people with that far eyebrows i can't believe david lee roth agreed to open for me at  west hampton performing arts center uh sunday that's just incredible wow well we're gonna do  i'm actually gonna if you call up and name david lee roth's first record he ever bought because i know  the answer oh you got a good memory for that right well it's not every day david lee roth's in your  fucking garage don't give any hits because you're gonna call up for free tickets i'm singing it 
[02:31:00]  all right or you can sing it go ahead i'll be the background music for the next uh few jokes  did you see the phil do you see the phil specter movie i did in fact how great was that uh it was  uh kind of frightening because that's a that's a temptation that's a place uh that in the last  scenes of there will be blood with daniel day lewis kind of takes place in the same kind of house  and i have one of those checkerboard hallways it's hard to tell if that's a stairway to heaven  or a stairway to somewhere really really fun i like the liverache movie so much i'm like no jokes 
[02:31:30]  behind the candelabra hbo at this point needs like their own academy awards like this is really  good that was really good every show they have like game of thrones and girls and uh the specter  are you happy i failed if you're not happy you know what everybody has been talking i just  everybody's been talking about the that particular show everybody has mentioned  game of thrones no no i love game of thrones game of thrones what would you know i don't know  you said that show didn't you say that show no i'm talking about the liberace show 
[02:32:00]  everybody's mentioning that i love it see guys is there not an academy awards for like uh  well the stuff is smarter you know the best comedy you can turn the sound off and you can't tell if  it's drama or comedy yeah you follow and you'll start to see that on the hbo's and the show times  and stuff so maybe a lot of times a little more dave was with tibetan mook uh tibetan mook tibetan mooks 
[02:32:30]  and he's asking him questions about comedy like he's he's a fan we gotta deal with these chinese  i was sitting with 12 buddhist monks the real deal they got the shaved heads and the robes and  everything i said gentlemen i don't think there's any laughter in heaven and you could hear a pin  drop you know right and i was waiting you know and just in case you know they got upset i was  going to say you know like jewish heaven but uh that's like shakespeare or something isn't it  there's no laughter until things go completely really really really wrong and they gotta laugh 
[02:33:00]  yeah yeah yeah that's i agree yeah but you don't see but you're right to a certain degree it's like  a lot of very uh religious people you don't see like monks laughing like why would you guys have  a ball once in a while like i've never seen keanu reeves laugh is he is he a monk uh might as well  as much as he actually speaks he might as well be are you talking speaks in public or speaks in his  flicks both now he's just doing these independent movies where he walks around in his greasy hair 
[02:33:30]  well you know made some folks maintain that the best acting like when how many how many syllables  does stallone use in his traditional flick i've seen the expendables you know five times because  he's the only english speaking in japan he goes that's enough for me bill murray lost in translation  didn't say a damn word he looked at the camera you saw how sad he was he was great i'm not kidding  i say with uh some mirth but uh the best acting is the least amount of knees and elbows and syllables  now you're paying attention to that guy right yeah somebody like least would you're terrified by 
[02:34:00]  that well that's still stallone but get out of my lawn you pan face  that's the best comedy he ever made  and you become if there's no flowery there's no delivery system it's just right there you didn't  see the liberagi movie yet no i love it i give it an a plus i think that uh he should win something  for it matt damon was amazing is there any room for improvement in that movie no i mean uh the acting 
[02:34:30]  was tremendous uh i would prefer a little more the ass fucking who saw matt damon coming we knew he  was good actor he was happening stuff he was doing with affleck and look at the two of them now boom  yeah the roles they're doing and the producing the directing and yeah yeah i can't wait to the stuff  from the next i love that it's a big f you and thumbing your nose at hollywood because when they  won their oscar for like uh goodwill hunting or whatever it was uh yeah goodwill hunting screen  where everybody's like well there's a sign of the apocalypse these two guys won an oscar like turns 
[02:35:00]  out they're fucking great hollywood yeah like he's such a good director and matt damon's great are  there is there finally academy award for production for producer yet oh no there's your answer that's  your money guy well it's the money guy but he's going to oversee you know variety i just i just  made a four minute gangster flick it's on the uh internet there i did it with an all japanese cast  and crew we call it a spaghetti eastern oh yeah holy shit yeah let's watch it it's uh you can find it on 
[02:35:30]  itunes you know the roth uh you can find it uh roth clip roth film clip etc and it's called  a roth cast too you got a great podcast so we uh shot that i started off with just a single  storyline it's a white guy walks into a i don't know where in japan there's three uh gangstans  talking japanese they don't know he does they're saying ugly things to him he turns and i use a  single line from the uh a kid's cartoon sailor moon that little girl's dug in the 80s and i use it 
[02:36:00]  as the death shit you know i say in the name of the sun and the moon stars i christ you now or i strike  you now and i'd shoot everybody in the room i see i hired 40 cast and crew and uh folks from uh  all uh lighting film camera set design they work on all the movies there and i said you fill in the  rest and it's a spaghetti eastern oh yeah and we spent six moves we spent six months doing it and  they're the ones who said okay you gotta have an old lady sitting over here and when that happens 
[02:36:30]  this music happens and then you have the blood spatter of the title well we gotta see this it's the name  of it it's on our facebook page right now open and yeah and uh we find it on uh the the inner  tubes it's for what's it called why don't we all look at msnbc at the same time to find out what  day's movie was the whole room went is that morning joe is that you could somebody dig it up and then  we'll just say the uh their dress well he's coming in to get it for you okay okay but at least  see your line that's what a producer does that's you know is you got to keep everybody moving north 
[02:37:00]  and motivating all the ideas so that when somebody says oh what if you have this kind of music here  oh what if you put that a horse in the background there that's what a producer is going to yay or  nay uh after the director does and there's some great producers out there without whom we wouldn't  have great movies yo brockheim since some brockheimer team was great who did i sit behind once at a  premiere uh erwin winkler um who i think oh yeah you know yeah i guess producers don't get enough of  the credit in the public but they certainly do in hollywood though like who put the team together 
[02:37:30]  you know a lot of guys where would the ball teams be if somebody wasn't there you know collecting  everybody and uh you know putting them together have you found it you know where we are oh there you  go the wrong story yeah you are can i say please you're not home watching it's um don't mind the  pain no mind list make it bigger you want please what is it your fucking ipad  i like the music this is kanishki he's the most famous uh sumo wrestler ever nothing's better on 
[02:38:00]  radio than video but that sounded that is very spaghetti western that's a very spaghetti western  sound and i just and i come walking into where everybody convenes this is uh kind of like the  10th street baths this is where everybody plays their cards this is where all the gangsters hang out  and like the russians in uh whatever is the place you go to actually or no dave's a regular he's a  regular there the lady knows you're here earlier than usual she's in a million she's in a million  earlier than usual right is that what you said i had no idea what i look like dave you're looking 
[02:38:30]  badass yes everybody who thinks they can act i thought let me like let's actually see what it  looks like on film here without me actually smiling once and without being the diamond dave i know  are these guys well-known actors in japan that's the most famous sumo wrestler in history  yeah i've seen that guy before yes i've i've seen that guy oh you can google him yeah yeah he's a  friend from tokyo i keep waiting for james to look at the camera go  somebody posted humble a baby is evil a bubble dead 
[02:39:00]  and uh you know another shit talking you i did my uh four minute uh gangster flick  piece of cake right yep wow these guys are really talking shit you can tell from all the ink and  everything and you can see that this is full of clues like the full moon is registered behind my  head and it's there's a tattoo on it it's the first scene of a movie we wrote and uh the character  that's in a fuck off in japanese right i speak japanese and i play uh or i'm rating it an assassin 
[02:39:30]  my character's name is brother teresa oh that's interesting yeah and uh the gangsta's name  big kurashiki his name is peach is uh and this is the first scene i could only afford the first  four minutes so it looks great it looks amazing this is kind of like if you you want this to be  made into a full film this is like what uh billy bob did with the sling blade you know make it into  a short uh everybody who shot this works on all the movies all around asia they shoot all the red  bowl and the coffee ads and everything most of these guys worked on lost in translation  and they've never had somebody actually set up a framework and say go right artist to artist 
[02:40:00]  this doesn't have to sell anything it doesn't have to attract any subscribers it doesn't have  to please any censors just as a team all 40 of us create this using this framework and i'll sponsor  it i'll produce and pay for it but it's uh it's well shot you're the coolest guy took us about six  months to pull this together you should like start a band or something  and this is international now it's just getting attention all over drinking milk out of the 
[02:40:30]  carton obviously he's a gangster oh that's a tradition that strawberry drink is it kind of a  drink that's been drinking over there since the early 50s you follow there's got the and  the quote i'm about to give comes from a little kid's cartoon it's the same as quoting popeye before  you pull the trigger which they found horrifying and delightful in japan yeah that's you know if 
[02:41:00]  you're drinking it and that's my audition reel we're launching my film career here today  that is you know what it's great i'm not seeing anything where i'm taken out of this  this is like it's a real film i'm a lot of intolerant i hope  and i say it with the perfect accent  and you have the obvious ending without hearing the gunshots right and there the bodies are left 
[02:41:30]  in a red wipe and then the walk-on with japanese credits that nobody can read exactly that says is that  a real tattoo yeah i got that finished when uh well we're not quite finished but uh that's the real  deal wow you got that on your back right now i got about 150 hours in there of the real deal  with the hand poking and everything his entire back yeah that is amazing  holy shit oh my god that is amazing work 
[02:42:00]  hey that's amazing jesus christ and you had all that done in japan  yeah and that's not riboside wow i know a guy that's pretty goddamn cool man diamond dave  in the house with the flip phone i like that prepaid i used it as uh holy shit like campfire  you know when you get around and the past the news of the day try out my language lesson that day i  went to school two hours a day for language and you know here's my latest stuff and you know what

[02:43:00]  wu shoot you watch john wu stuff of course and i love that type of uh that's like a really  uh an asian way of shooting for some reason they don't shoot that way in america and i love the way  that stuff is done like i was the only uh this is a follow-up to dave's movie it's a chinese circus  a bear and a monkey the bear eats the monkey jay it's not very nice no no no but uh it's a film  crew that i was i was the only outsider gaijin face that was on there and uh you know good time to 
[02:43:30]  motivate people they had never had somebody say if you got a good idea i'll pay for it that's what  a producer does and everybody's all the music goes here but not that kind of instrument and then don't  hear the gunshots that's not traditional skip the gunshots and show the drip now oh okay all right  and uh just made sense to me and i was just kind of wander from department to department going how  about a little more of that oh that was good can you turn that up louder and how cool is dave  as an apartment in japan like it's where he lives most of the time yeah yeah you're the coolest guy 
[02:44:00]  i just finished a year overseas and i'm dying uh i'm gonna i'm done and i'm back uh here for  american culture you know pizza pizza comedy seller and strip tease are you guys going back on the road  are you just hanging now uh in about three days i'm meeting the fellas in nagoya and we're doing the  japan tour we got about 40 000 of our closest friends and you just said you came back from there  yesterday afternoon yeah now you're going back sure yeah well come on for most folks a 10 or 12 
[02:44:30]  hour airplane flight that's a little unforgiving we do 10 and 12 hour bus rides every night out on  the road you follow and people say but you can walk around now nobody walks on a bus you get out of the  bunk you fight your way like das boot up to where you always say you know wait for the burrito to  microwave and change channel change the cable and that's all you do so you know flying uh  you know on a 12 hour flight to japan frankly the food's a little better on the airplane  yeah and i'm sure you know which band uh which band is this you're going out with van halen we're 
[02:45:00]  playing on new oh van halen yes you know the guys of them jay up and coming guys and uh there you go  we're doing uh tokyo osaka nagoya we put this off ed was ill last season so this is the delayed  routine and wolf gang on base yep that is and they uh michael anthony though huh i don't don't go  there okay sorry and people people know you i wasn't you know i'm not asking you to throw i 
[02:45:30]  apologize i don't know wolf plays plays a great place and he's got a great voice that's really  coming along strong as far as my old team you're always going to have the the original is going to  be best that's who i got 10 000 hours you know the 10 000 hour rule none of us were really that good  until we passed that 10 000 hour moment even bobby fisher as a chess prodigy had to do his 10  before he was able to really bring it to the rush but at least the end of his life with dignity  how did he die bobby he died i think of cancer but you know and i love he's one of my favorite 
[02:46:00]  people ever really crazy he was just such a psychotic anti-semite but he was a jewish he was  a full-blood jewish guy's mother father and just he went out you know he 9-11 the fucking jewish like  he was like that angry you hear the phone call he made on 9-11 he started to sound like homeless or  whatever you know but that type of genius comes with a price and that's what it was he was so  brilliant you'll never have to worry about that do you play chess is it's all i took chess lessons  from probably half a dozen different teachers and you know what i don't use i don't play a good game  of chess but i use it in real in real life constantly i think 10 moves ahead i had a great 
[02:46:30]  teacher mr gufeld from uh he was the soviet socialist republic coach from all of the 70s and  edward gufeld and he would say chess is gymnastic for brand and he would anyway and he taught with  his forearm if i made a mistake bam he'd knock all the pieces off he go okay mr genius now we try a  memory to perfect again and wow wow that an asshole well actually all right now wait i'm going to  translate this a little different anybody who cares enough to get that excited around me i'm interested 
[02:47:00]  in because we make a living around people who are so blasé and full of savvy and our agents and  managers who've seen it all and yeah it's a good idea guys and whatever somebody gets excited enough  to go no oh i'm interested in that kind of energy especially if it's channeled my way  when he's playing the russians some kid was just tapping his uh chess piece drove him nuts on the side 
[02:47:30]  of the book but it took him two days to realize he was playing out of his speed he was he sped up the  kid sped him up just he just had a really holding a pawn and as he was thinking he would just go like  this and then bobby fisher like was getting his teeth kicked in and i think it wound up in a draw  because he once he figured it out wow it out but like the mind games those guys play are other  in russia if you won you got to go spend two weeks in cuba and that's where he would train okay  if you lost you went the other way siberia or this kind of a thing he accused those guys of 
[02:48:00]  cheating too he said that the russians would manipulate and lose games to each other to  position certain guys to play certain guy like you know he and he probably wasn't bicycle racing yeah  that happens in nascar too it's like in bicycle racing don't they decide uh you know okay we're  gonna the guys who aren't the number one runner will move away until so-and-so can lunge forward or  so yeah yeah yeah they they use a team mentality for national pride because for the soviets it was 
[02:48:30]  the important thing for the russians to win not for for kasparov or for no individuals yeah it's  for the freaking are we surprised is there any sport that doesn't have cheating in it is there any sport  that doesn't have steroids and uh blood doping and yeah really i like the cheating i like the  steroids you're not cheating you're not trying well also you know i like it i'd like to position a  thought here that if you're going to get involved as long as the other guys using steroids i don't  care it brings it all up to you know relative it's all relative when you were a kid playing 
[02:49:00]  wiffle ball in the driveway every once in a while you put a little pebble in the wiffle ball  because the guy fouls it off the ball the the little pebble flies out you're like whoa  i don't even know if i can throw that one again that was weird baseball is nothing but cheating  the curveball yeah stealing home you know it's like it's all larceny  yeah that's right i mean there's a play in baseball called stealing yeah somebody somebody  wrote once that uh the first time monkeys it really exhibited human-like intelligence is when 
[02:49:30]  one lied to the other and tricked them for the first time really oh that was the big break point  in human intellect monkeys developed from that point the first time a monkey lied to the other  they struck them intentionally they said okay now we can see humans happening i know it was a  couple and the and the and the male monkey slid back and he pulled the condom off and then put  his dick back in and she had no idea he said no honey that is your impression on a pillow  and then the female monkey said it's your monkey 
[02:50:00]  and it's monkey time  yes my man the first record he ever bought monkey time  right can we play that iraq we got that i had a guy uh tweet me after he listened to you on my  podcast he went to baskin robbins with his kids like minutes after finishing the podcast and that  was playing and he said he wanted to look at everybody  there's a place right across town whenever you're ready 
[02:50:30]  this has roots you'll hear bruce springsteen in the song if you hear uh  if you play the song you'll go oh springsteen has his feet both planted in that kind of music  there's a place right across town  wherever you're ready  it's like you know you remember that i've never heard that once you play it you'll kind of hear a 
[02:51:00]  little bit of monkey time major lands of monkey time major time it's 1960s new york city style rock  you know it's east coast and it's got the you know it's got uh like the glock in the background  that bing bing bing bing well he looks for it look here we go turn it up turn it up turn it up  springsteen sure little horns  oh sandy  the fireworks are hailing over little eden tonight 
[02:51:30]  it's  it's feel good east coast stuff  i like it  are you waiting  slow  for monkey time  monkey time 
[02:52:00]  i'm not saying a word  it's too cool  i don't know how it started  you gotta that's where you sing to each other on the dance floor  was this remade by anybody  oh i don't know  well see what's happening is  it sounds like a lot of songs you've just heard right  and that's why i say bruce because i grew up around it too  and it's in the music it's like curry downtown it's in everything  right right and uh you can you hear that it's happy and it's good dancing 
[02:52:30]  yeah yeah yeah  it's got brass  first record he ever bought  there's another version in here  all right let me hear that version  shut up  leave my life  what are you doing  i want to hear the other version  he's in the middle of singing  you want to put something else on  i want to hear the other version  i'll take full responsibility  his happy birthday to you  somebody with a syllable name  kajagugu  too shy shy  100 haircuts  he also had another song  that was uh 
[02:53:00]  when you know you've seen songs  see where you got 12 year old guys  you know walking down their tracks  singing you know purple bikini  uh polka dot bikini and stuff  these songs were to me  that way you would learn where the part is  you sing to each other and so forth  and uh major lance 1961  that was the first single that i got  i had to rake the lawn for uh  almost five days  damn  in a row  and uh that's how i earned the cash for it  by the single  it was a dollar five  45  did you listen to it more than once in a row  i listened to it 7,000 times in a row 
[02:53:30]  and now if somebody says to me  dave can you give me any advice  as a new young artist musician  painter drama  absolutely  at any given time  have a song  that you're listening to  over and over again  like 30 times a day  there's something like this  that's feel good whatever  and you'll get tired of it  in three weeks  replace it with another song  when you get to my age  you put that song on  you go right back  oh man this is when i was on  i'll be an anthony  this is when i was  and jay was there  and i was wearing that t-shirt  you know and like that 
[02:54:00]  that was my favorite t-shirt  where did i go  bring it right back  and you will go right back  and i have dozens and dozens  and dozens of songs like that  and i just  i carry the song  the one it's in the deck  down below  doesn't have to be any kind of  certain song  it can be pop  it can be dance  groove country  blues  old new  and just listen to that one song  over and over  and you put it in  you go  oh oh  that was the summer  in tokyo  oh  and you go right back  no movie  no book 
[02:54:30]  no play can take you  like that  you follow  only music can do that  when you hear a song  sometimes there's a  visceral feeling  not only a memory  it's like  you get a weird feeling  like you did when you were there  completely reliving  that time  and if you're doing it  during the summer  like the summer coming up  like i dig the humidity  and you know  and you can feel  their skin starts to do like that  you know  it's like when somebody goes  how about some pizza  and your mouth starts to water  whatever that response is  kicks in  and when i hear that song 
[02:55:00]  major lance  i know exactly  oh oh  that skateboard we built  yeah we had to make it out of  roller skates  you had to saw a roller skate in half  and use the clay wheels  and you had to use  two halves of the roller skate  on a piece of four by four  and that's what major lance is to me  that's a marty mcfly  can i ask you a van halen question  sure  of course  my favorite band  uh when you guys do like intruder  and do uh any instrumental like that  it just it seems incongruous to the whole album 
[02:55:30]  like when you have just these monster songs  monster songs monster songs  and then it's only like a minute and a half  of just an instrumental  i think the casual fan goes  why why'd they stick that in there  it's weird  is that is it music that just there aren't words to yet  and you go well fuck it  we're not even trying to do the words  apparently it's an instrumental  and it must go on diver down  it's too good to leave out  a lot of it is  comes from the club days  it's a good point  a lot of it comes from the club days 
[02:56:00]  when we would have to play  five 45 minute sets  we learn about that  from reading about the beatles  and the stones  and every good uh  rock band whoever  so you learn to stretch  oh yeah exactly  we understand that  the first solo would be just like the record  the second solo would be an eddie solo  and then you would have to have intros  to do a lot like what we do here  you know  hey don't forget we're going to be here tomorrow night  if you had a great time  tell a friend  if you've had a shitty time  tell an enemy  because we're still going to be back here tomorrow  and the ladies dance contest on wednesday 
[02:56:30]  don't forget that  and i'd be doing my stuff  and you'd need to have something going on  you know set up a groove  and the guys would play along  and uh it becomes  it starts to become actually  part of the music  it's not just an add-on  you follow  and we got so used to doing that  for well you know  like the middle part  of you really got me  you know you're making the noises  and carrying on  and it's  intruders certainly  but like cathedral  is like a completely different sound entirely  it's almost radio head-ish 
[02:57:00]  before it's time  well we had a mix and match  uh taste in music  we weren't just one neighborhood  i call it  heavy metal is one neighborhood  uh you know  we were thunder funk  we were also playing songs like  uh cool in the gang  and get down tonight  and stuff  in the beer bars  and learn how to work the vocals  so because we didn't have keyboards  and so forth  so you would mix zz top  with uh  you know ohio players  in the same set  you know  and have to go from one song  to the other  without giving a break  because you don't want to clear 
[02:57:30]  the dance floor  and piss off the guy at the bar  because then his beer sales dwindle  not to be a dog  with a chew toy here  but are there songs with lyrics  that are on the cutting room floor  that you go  well maybe we should have put that  instead of cathedral  uh most of those songs  are on the most recent album  different kind of truth  we have a  a group of tunes  that uh  didn't get quite fleshed out  and especially lyrical  i'll be the first one to say  it's your fault dave  it is my fault  slowing everything down  well you know 
[02:58:00]  when you first start off  like anything else  it's all devils and fire  and you know  you know  let's sleep with another game  let's sleep with two now  hey let's get those bunk beds apart  how about three  hot lava  hot lava  yes  and then  and then you start to figure out  the six or eight bad habits  you're really good at  and then you focus lyrically  you mature  you're the best  well done sir

[03:05:00]  asshole  and we were  talking about  that while  we were just  shooting the  shit here  is that  I  I fucking  you know  I've been a  lot of  stressed out  I've been  snapping  I've been  in a  great mood  I'm very  excited that  my kids  coming  right  by this  when this  comes out  he could  already  came  yeah  he's coming  out next  Thursday  so he  could  already  fucking  came  Jesus  um  it's wild  so  I'm very  excited though  I'm very  happy  I'm very  let's do  this  right  um 
[03:05:30]  but I'm  also  stressed  out  a lot  you know  I've been  sleeping  that well  blah blah  blah blah  blah  and I've  been  snapping  on  cabbies  and  you know  people  not close  people  but you  know  the people  you should  fucking  snap  on  right  you know  yeah  well I  think  that  I think  all of  that  will  diffuse  if you  relocate  with your  family out  of the  city  you know  I think  New York  it really  is like  in Ghostbusters  2  where they  talk about  that river  of slime  under the  city  it's like  something about  this place  it's just 
[03:06:00]  if you're  already prone  to freak  like guys  like us  are  this city  is not  going to  help you  not do  that  you can  beat it  but it's  not going  to help  you not  do it  it's  going to  throw  fuel  in that  fire  every  fucking  day  well here's  here's  what  New York  is great  for  when you're  a guy  like me  you can  thrive  in this  city  you can  walk  around  on edge  and you  kind of  fit in  right  but when  you want  to not  be that  guy  come home 
[03:06:30]  because you've  been traveling  all fucking  day  when staying  out till  five in the  morning  isn't what  you really  want to do  because you  got to get  up the next  day or  you don't  want to  sleep until  three or  your wife  wants you  to do  some queer  shit  right  you know  you  it's like  you come  home and  you can't  get a  parking  spot  because  there's  a new  club  on your  block  and everybody's  parking  and as soon  as you get  one somebody  pulls in  and steals  it from  you who lives  in fucking  Jersey  and they  don't even  live in  your  neighborhood  or you're  trying to  get a cab 
[03:07:00]  with your  pregnant  wife  at 930  at night  down at  fucking  Christopher  Street  and there's  fucking  men  young men  thin little  medium  douchebags  in the  sports coats  with the  t-shirts  and the  little  European  Sherlock  Holmes  shoes  and they  run in  and grab  the cab  in front  of a  pregnant  woman  and then  they  immediately  get on  their  phone  as soon  as they  get in  they look  at their  phone  because they  don't want 
[03:07:30]  to make  eye contact  because if  they do  for the first  time in my life  I put a hex  on a cab  driver  a hex  I didn't know  what to say  Joe  I went  I hex you  I jinx you  I gave him  the devil  horns  on both  sides  and I went  and he  went  what  he got  scared  I think  he was  Jamaican  you know  he's from  some country  where they  believe that's  possible  I didn't  know what  to do  it was  either that  or fucking  grab the  little twink  out of the  back seat  and throw  him in the 
[03:08:00]  gutter  oh my god  Jesus  you gotta  get out  of this  town  dude  I gotta  go  I need  a driveway  and I  know I'll  get sick  of those  assholes  we just  made  these muffins  I'm gonna  hate that  little  place too  this is the  by the way  we're two  three minutes  in and I'm  two movie  quotes in  already  because I'm  about to  quote another  movie  this is the  beginning of  stir crazy  dude  where they're  sitting in  that bar  and they  see the  dudes  fighting  and G  Wilder  goes  do you  see what  this town  does to  people  we gotta  get out  of here  you're at  that phase  dude  it's like  you gotta 
[03:08:30]  it's time  to go  man  it's not  good for  it's not  good for  your heart  your soul  and then  you don't  want to  bring that  home  with your  kid  you don't  even want  to bring  that home  when you  got a  dog  whose  behavior  is influenced  by that  you know  what I mean  my dog  trembles  at lightning  because he  thinks it's  me  going  what the  fuck  in the  business  never gives  me a break  yeah dude  you're right  I went  and looked  at houses  this week  brother  where at  up in 
[03:09:00]  Jersey  West  Jersey  I can  tell you  I went  up to  I'll tell  you the  towns  I went  up to  West  Jersey  and below  Nyack  in between  the George  Washington  and the  Tappan Z  on what  is that  called  I don't  know  I'm not  sure  but I  kind of  know  where you  mean  yeah  it's  below  Nyack  across  the river  it's  New York  right  but it's  upper  New York  you know  what I 
[03:09:30]  mean  I'll tell  you exactly  where it is  I'm looking  at it  right now  isn't that  called  West  New York  or something  like that  some shit  like that  it's called  Tappan  and Rockley  that up  there  and it's  on the  Palisades  Parkway  Palisades  Parkway  and then  over left  somewhere  in Jersey  further down  30 minutes  out of the  city  with no  traffic  right  and  I'm telling  you  the house  that I  wanted  it was  my dream  house  sold  gone  it was  on the  market  for a  week  and it's  already  fucking  four days  it's 
[03:10:00]  gone  you'll get  it though  you'll get  another thing  where you'll  go  thank god  we didn't  get that  other one  yeah  it'll  just  happen  you know  like  yeah  because I  moved out  to Brooklyn  which by  the way  has been  life  literally  life  changing  for me  really  changed  my whole  fucking  attitude  why  it's  everything  we're  talking  about  man  like  I was  so depressed  living  I'm not  shitting on  Manhattan  man  I love  Manhattan  but I got  really depressed  living here  because I was  in an apartment  I didn't like  I was  with a landlord  company  that was 
[03:10:30]  treating me  poorly  in my opinion  I didn't like  the building  I was in  the neighborhood  I was in  felt like  deserted  and I never  left my house  because I was  like why  would I leave  my house  to walk  to what  Nordstrom  Rack  and spend  fifty dollars  on bullshit  I don't need  or to this  overpriced  fucking restaurant  where the food  is not that  good  there was just  nothing to  look at  there was  nothing to do  so I moved  to Brooklyn  I'm on  I'm in  Williamsburg  I'm on a  street lined 
[03:11:00]  with beautiful  trees  tons of  leaves  my apartment  has got  four fucking  huge windows  central air  climate control  in the apartment  there's a  playground  and a basketball  court across  the street  so the only  noise I hear  is nice  it's like  nice to hear  moms playing  with their kids  and dudes  playing hoop  and shit  it feels  like neighborhood  and dude  I walk  out of my  place  there's so  much cool  shit  to walk  to  it's just  a cool  neighborhood  to be out  in  and it's  not  I live  South 
[03:11:30]  Williamsburg  North  Williamsburg  is like  the Times  Square  of Brooklyn  and I can  walk to it  in five minutes  if you want  to be in  the thickest  shit  and if I  don't want  to be in  it  I walk  the fuck  out of  it  and it's  fine  and dude  it's just  like  every restaurant  is a home  run  record stores  that I like  shit like  that  cool fucking  clothing shops  coffee shops  where you can  just go  and talk  to people  it's just  that kind  of vibe  dude  so it  makes me  want to  get up  how is it  getting to  Newark  I mean 
[03:12:00]  probably  it's the same  price for a cab  as it is for  Manhattan  it was like  60 bucks  to get there  when I lived  in Hell's Kitchen  and it's the same  price  if I was going to  take the train  it's more annoying  you gotta fucking  take the  if I was going to  train it  I would have to  get to the  Penn Station  which is like  the L to  whatever  to Penn Station  and then down  so I don't  think I'm  going to be  fucking with  Newark  too much  anymore  here's my  thing with  New York  dude  what I'm  going to  have to  do  is sell  my place  or rent 
[03:12:30]  a place  and buy  a place  because  I need  to get  that cash  you know  what I mean  I need  that fucking  cash  so it's  going to  be a weird  process  for me  because I'm  going to  have to  go and  be somewhere  where I'm  not going  to be  for a while  so it might  be Brooklyn  it might  be Queens  it might  be Astoria  it might  be I  go rent  a house  in Jersey  for a  year  I don't  know  but I  got to  get the  fuck  out  but my  only problem  is getting  to those  airports  you know  we're on  the road  so much  and getting  to JFK  Hell's Kitchen 
[03:13:00]  is so centrally  located  to me  to everything  well Brooklyn  is closer  to those  two airports  and it's  cheaper to  get to  in a car  car service  for me  to LaGuardia  is like  25 bucks  it was like  33 from  Hell's Kitchen  and no toll  because you're  past the tunnel  yeah  you know  it's  you know  Maureen Taron  yeah  obviously  she  when I was  first thinking  about moving  out there  I was just  like Maureen  I can't  fucking figure  this out  like what 
[03:13:30]  neighborhood  to go  and she  goes look  you're never  going to get  everything  it's impossible  unless you're  a goddamn  billionaire  you're never  going to have  a perfect  situation  so she's  like make  a list  of what  you need  most  and then  work backwards  from there  and I was  like okay  and that's  what helped  me settle  on where I  went  because I  knew what  was important  for me  was I  wanted to  be in a  neighborhood  where I  wanted to  leave the  house  and meet  people  dude  me and  Don went  to this  place  this house  we pull  up  it's a  stone  driveway  trees  everywhere  bamboo  surrounding 
[03:14:00]  the house  it's  you walk  in it's  a contemporary  house  in the  50s  glass  angled  walls  and ceilings  loft  looking down  into the  living room  you walk  out back  it's like  you know  a one  two  three  tiered  deck  into  a garden  I was  I was  thinking  I was like  oh  I actually  heard myself  go  oh a garden  yeah  I could  fucking  and then  you know  the bedroom  was fine  we'd have to do  some alterations  to this house  but then the lazy  yeah you should go to the store 
[03:14:30]  down the street  it's called the market  we go in  it's all handmade  sandwiches  and breads  and soups  and it's  hey how you doing  what's going  you gotta try these  Kobe dogs  and they're the nicest  people ever  and yet  I don't know  if that shit  used to bug  the fuck  out of me  nice white people  that made  Puerto Ricans  friendly  like trained  Puerto Ricans  Jesus  used to  hey man  fuck you 
[03:15:00]  I see your  teardrop tattoo  I see the  you have MS-13  on your arm  and you're telling me  about fresh baked bread  oh that's funny  so  I used to hate it  but now I'm like  I love it  I went there  we had  all this great food  and we sat down  so friendly  I wanted to buy  the place right there  and just call it a day  right  but you're absolutely right  your place will find you  I will get out of the city  now  I'm a firm believer  that whatever you really want  truly want 
[03:15:30]  you'll get  yeah  but the only way  that you'll get it  is uh  I just looked at your phone  and I just got  oh my god dude  this is  I just  I just literally  I oh my god  you just took away  I stopped thinking  about my child  and the home  I'm gonna  is like house  look at the shine  on the back of it  I got the new  Samsung Galaxy 4  which Bob does not have yet  and we're gonna talk  a lot about this 
[03:16:00]  but I  I feel bad  to distract you  I wanna keep talking  about what we're talking about  put that in your pocket  put that away dude  um  god damn it  that look good  um  what do you see  the screen  dude  alright hang on  hang on  we used to talk  this way about pussy  yeah  um  yeah  it's  it's like  I go back to my house  I took the bus today  um  I hate the bus  I fucking despise the bus  I'll never take a bus  to somewhere  it's just a rule I have 
[03:16:30]  where did you take it  just in the city  I just jumped on the bus today  I do it every once in a while now  because  it's fucking  a goof  it's the same as a train  you stand in the  I'm gonna get a cab  the bus pulls up in front of me  it's going to the same place  it makes a hundred stops  there's old people  and lunatics  and it smells like diapers  right  but it's a goof  right  I kinda like the bus  I don't mind  cool and air conditioned  it's cool  but the guys are driving  to cunts  right  they drive  they're not driving  like they're driving  life lives around

[03:20:00]  I have a nice  sized kitchen again  so I started  cooking again  right  and it's fucking  great  dude all that  supermarket shit  I'll tell you  when I visit my  parents  I couldn't live  where my parents  live  and I have  dear  I have dear  friends  what was that  I don't know  hang on  hang on  hang on  keep talking  so the  yeah the buzzer  just  I don't know  the doorbell  or something  just rang  and Bobby  is now going  to see  who it could be  I feel like 
[03:20:30]  it's probably  the guy  that  I think he has  somebody's keys  I don't know  now Bobby  is saying  who is it  repeatedly  to whoever's  on the other  end of this  intercom  which  I don't know  what they do  with intercoms  in New York  but every time  you press the button  to listen to  who's downstairs  it sounds like  there's a blizzard  happening  so  I don't know  why he's doing  that  not why he's  doing that  but I don't know  why it sounds  like that  because it's  always  you can never  hear who it is  anyway 
[03:21:00]  this has been  my  New York  intercom bit  while Bob  was gone  and  he's back  dude I don't  know what  the fuck  that was  it's probably  like somebody  wants to put  menus under  the doors  they just  ring any  bell  people don't  do that  here  there's a  gate  I think  one of the  guys hit  the wrong  button  something  because I  heard  some  fucking  accent  but  here's the  thing  I couldn't  live where  my parents  lived  despite the  fact that  I have  some really  good  friends  out there  that's  why you're  a goddamn  professional 
[03:21:30]  just stop  everybody  he didn't  fucking  even miss  a beat  he did  his thing  he explained  it  and then  as soon  as I  sat back  down  and he  picked it  right back  up where  he left  off  all you  little  podcasters  out there  or all  you little  interviewers  rewind that  go ahead  Joe  I love it  I don't  like  digressing  it would be  funny now  if we  digressed  about  digressing  hey folks  that's a  little  Williamsburg  humor  that's a  little  wordplay  no but 
[03:22:00]  I couldn't  despite the  fact that I  have really  good friends  out there  and people  to actually  hang out  with  and have  fun  with  I  couldn't  live out  there  because  you know  you walk  outside at  10 o'clock  the streets  are black  it is  everybody  the doors  are shut  the lights  are out  I can't  do that  it freaks  me out  but that's  I can't  do it  because I'm  a single  dude  and I need  to commit  suicide  I'd kill  myself if I  didn't have  my wife  right exactly  the place  I looked  at  if I lived  there alone 
[03:22:30]  I'd be  first of all  hookers galore  whatever hookers  were in that  town would  know my name  you'd get  the nice  expensive ones  too  they're pricey  out there  in the burbs  because they  gotta travel  there's no  let's just  go around  the corner  in fucking  Poughkeepsie  New Jersey  yeah there's  no chick  gonna call  you Poppy  up in  no  but the  one thing  she's sucking  your dick  to get  her real  estate license  up in  New Paul  so whatever  the fuck  you want  I uh 
[03:23:00]  but I do  look forward  to when I'm  there I  actually like  you know my  parents feel  like it's a  special occasion  when I'm home  so they're  always like  where do you  want to go  let's go out  to dinner  dude nine  times out of  ten I say  let me go to  the supermarket  I will buy a  bunch of stuff  and we'll cook  like I enjoy  walking around  a big supermarket  talking to the  clerks the  friendliness of it  all oh look a  seafood section  I'll get some  of this and  here's the  meats and  whatever and  you get 
[03:23:30]  fucking creative  or whatever  and then you  go home and  you're in a  fucking nice  size kitchen  there's a  grill out back  you cook the  shit I like  that shit  man I  remember Patrice  I went over  his house when  he lived with  Will in Jersey  City his first  joint he took  me over to the  international  supermarket which  is just a  fucking ginormous  supermarket and it  has like China  or India or  you know Japan  and it's like  it'll say Japan  and it's all the  Japanese foods  yeah like it  doesn't say it  but it is that  you know like  that's all the 
[03:24:00]  Japanese food  all Chinese food  or seafood and  steaks blah blah  blah and he took  me in there one  day and we  walked around and  got so much  shit giant king  crab legs which I  never had at that  time all this  great food and  we went back to  his house and  he just cooked  this crazy meal  and I was like  dumbfounded like  what the fuck  you can do that  yeah it's amazing  yeah that's the  thing though is  that you know  I've talked about  this before on the  show you gotta go  to 19 different  places in New York 
[03:24:30]  City because there's  no one place to go  I can't believe in  New York they don't  have a giant  supermarket somewhere  in the middle of  the city and I know  it's because the  trucks can't get in  and they can't stock  it and there's not  enough room  well actually it's  not super close to  you but it's closer  than Harlem there's a  fairway now well  actually you got a  fairway on the  Upper West Side at  76 how big is it  though is it is it  fucking huge dude  a fairway it's huge  where is that but 
[03:25:00]  so how do I get  home you take a cab  that's what I used to  do that when I lived  in Hell's Kitchen I  would do a set at  stand-up New York I'd  walk to fairway it was  like three blocks away  on Broadway I would do  all my shopping and I  would just get a cab  home so it's just  fucking annoying it is  but I mean you you  know there's some  there's all I'm trying  to say is there are  some options that are a  little better than  what you think is out  there because fuck  Food Emporium right  well fuck that  shithole you know we  lived you know blocks  from one of those  places and it was like 
[03:25:30]  that place it's  overpriced it's dog  shit it's it sucks the  selection sucks  Gristides is kind of  you know but but I'm  fairway there's one and  there's one in my old  neighborhood in  Gramercy you know  what I want I want one  of those big ass  motherfucking super  stopping shops or  whatever the fuck  their shop rights or  when you go like a  Ralph's and you walk  in and you don't  have it's just massive  right and a massive 
[03:26:00]  fruit section you're  like what the fuck  there's fruits  everywhere right then a  massive meat set and  I'm pulled and you go  up the aisles are huge  you won't touch anybody  because they're just so  big and then they have  a Starbucks and they  have a pharmacy it's  just a massive one stop  you go there for a  couple hours and you  pack the fucking thing  and then you go home  yeah yeah it's great  man it's great you  should check out  western beef I mean  it's discount stuff  but that's on the  that's over by me yeah  it's not far yeah it's 
[03:26:30]  down they moved first  of all so it's a little  farther but that's a  pain in the ass too and  the you know the the  aisles are a foot and a  half wide yeah well yeah  that place is all about  getting a deal that's  like the fucking you know  Walmart of supermarket you  know what I mean like  it's like a Kmart  supermarket everything's  cheap and yeah whatever  but um dude I hear you  man look I'll tell you  this I you know I don't  know if I'll ever move  even when I if I have a  family one day I don't  know if I'll ever move 
[03:27:00]  out of New York I think  I'm too like into it but  my plan now is when I  have when I can afford to  take a car service that  cost 40 bucks each way  whenever the fuck I want  and I don't have to think  twice about it I'm  talking every day twice a  day back and forth if I  have to and I don't even  have to give a shit I'll  move in I'll move deeper  into Brooklyn and get  Ann Harris just moved  out there with her  husband and her baby and  their baby right dude  their house is or their 
[03:27:30]  apartment is fucking  amazing they got a huge  backyard they got a patio  but is it theirs I don't I  don't know if they bought  it or not but I would  but is it theirs and do  they have to share it with  who it's an apartment right  yeah but apartment  buildings in Brooklyn are  a little different dude  there's like five  apartments in a building  it's not like New York  where yeah but who get  who gets the backyard no  no it's their backyard but  there's five other people  in the building yeah but  there the yard comes out of  their back door okay so

[03:33:00]  guy the guy that becomes that guy is  the guy that doesn't see it coming do  you know what I'm saying I yeah I guess  but I've I've seen I've said that like  who's that oh that's oh man he used to  fucking he was the motherfucker well  you know it's like dude you know what  all that shit man it's comedy is no  different from music in the sense that  look we have our one hit wonders too  you know and it's like you could pull  up a fucking band from the 80s and go  these guys man nobody was fucking 
[03:33:30]  bigger than flock of seagulls man you  know they were the guys that everybody  wanted to be and then it's like three  years later who gave a fuck I'm trying  to shit on the guys but you know it's  the same thing with comedy you know and  it's like and then you see them on  stage with their feathered hair still  and the feel like guys what are you  doing so the fact that you're aware  of that it's like you'll keep putting  your work in and either that or you'll  have a moment where you go fuck it I  don't care anymore I don't care if I'm  that guy I'm just this is how I'm doing  it and at that point it wouldn't bother

[03:36:00]  he's a fucking solid dude he's fucking  hilarious god damn it and you know he's  in he's a very soft-spoken dude very  nice guy yeah never had a bad no problem  with the guy was just a sweet guy really  nice guy unlikable you know saying you  say what un unlikable oh he it's  impossible to not like him that yeah I  agree I agree that's what you were  saying though I'm unlikable I didn't  hear the first on I was like he's saying  nice stuff then he said unlikable no I  got you unlike he's just a great guy but 
[03:36:30]  he goes up last night and he fucking  mad is kid yeah and I didn't even think  twice about it and I went up after him  and I tried to just you know I tried I  was just I had no idea what I just went  up you know like it's a I went up like a  fucking and I was okay what's up and I  just looked at dude's face look at your  face and I just I just think they were  like what they just saw a craftsman a guy  who sat down at a desk and wrote incredibly 
[03:37:00]  awesome jokes set up punch tag and just  orchestrated them together like a just  just like a fucking a savant musician just  put this all together and and then  practice it and then presented it on a  Tuesday night to a small audience and  they went oh my god and then I came up  after him what's up fucking look at your  face and then I tried to go into my shit 
[03:37:30]  and it was just so crude and and I say  fuck too much when I get you know fucking  fuck I just turn into Boston Bob right  fucking fucking cock fucking right I didn't  bomb because I don't think it's I have it in  me to bomb anymore right because I have  too many I have too much knowledge and  too many skills I have too many weapons  to die right right you know what I mean  but I can take a beaten yeah yeah I know  what you mean and what you mean oh my  god did I take a hot it was just a 
[03:38:00]  fucking wow that's tough man that's  tough there's nothing worse than a when  a wing it set goes wrong and you're just  like who the fuck do I think I am I  didn't even try to think of what I was  going to say here's the thing is if you  try it you got up before you I go up  there at least you know what fuck it  I'm gonna bomb I don't give a fuck and  then it goes I don't care yeah  psychologically you can't beat me yeah  that's what I did that's what I did  tonight is I before I came down here I  went what am I doing tonight why am I 
[03:38:30]  going on stage right my good why am I  going to the cellar right now right right  am I going to have fun am I going to  work on something because if not I  shouldn't be going down there yeah I  talked dude I 110% agree with that I  think particularly the last year when  I got to a because I knew I was going  to be working on a new album and stuff  so I knew when I got that hour  together of what I wanted it to be at  least initially I wasn't doing as many  spots I'm like I'm not doing this I'm  not going to run these jokes into the  ground and then fuck it up by trying to 
[03:39:00]  figure out how to take 10 minutes  slivers out of the hour I'll go do  spots on the weekends when I'm in town  to make some cash but I can't I can't  and then I started doing this thing  where I was like that's the that's  the hour over there and I'm just  going to when I do sets I'm going to  do these jokes you know like that  aren't in it because whatever and you  have to do that man running around and  doing nine sets in which you can't even  fucking do anymore it doesn't seem like  I guess there was a time where guys did 
[03:39:30]  12 sets a night I haven't seen me do  that in years yeah but I mean I don't  know maybe some guys can but like  running around and doing that to me  anymore is just like it's just it's  just a it's like you're proving  something it's yeah you beat the jokes  on the goddamn ground they work okay  it's you know what I tried to do yeah  it is weird because what happened to  me like I've been working the cellar  since I'm waiting to have this baby I'm  home now until this baby comes out so  I'm working the weekends and I'm 
[03:40:00]  working the you know the comedy cellar  and the new comedy cellar right which is  kind of fucking nostalgic for me to go  from place to place right and it's the  same place it reminds me of the old  Nick's comedy stop in Boston right they  had upstairs and downstairs oh that's  cool and you'd go up and down and down  500 people 500 people oh that's really  cool and now on weekends you go over do  a set at the comedy cellar run around  the corner to the village underground and  it's a replica of the comedy cellar except  it's bigger and better right and you go 
[03:40:30]  up there and do a little longer set right  sometimes it's 20 right and it's more  money that's great and then you run  back to the cellar that's great but  what I was doing was exactly that I was  I was literally taking out my hour which  I just signed to do yeah congrats on  that by the way you told me that I can't  wait yeah I can't wait to get it you  know what I can't wait with to get it  out and and I'm trying I'm gonna make  it as fucking slamming as I possibly  can yeah the biggest compliment you give  me after a show I didn't stop laughing  once right because I know there's guys 
[03:41:00]  that do shows and there's lulls right  there's fucking lulls right which I I  don't think it's bad I don't think it's  good but I like when you have that hour  and you can step on the gas right and  fucking go right and it's like holy  shit that's so I'm excited to get this  out but I started taking that hour and  making it into a 20 minute set and I'm  like and it's killing is 20 and I'm  losing yeah the connections yeah the 
[03:41:30]  the pieces that went in between that to  make the building blocks yep of the hour  yeah and you're right it is dangerous but  I you know I um so I this is what I  started to do I started to take I'm gonna  do the first 15 and that's it that's  smart the second 15 and that's it that's  smart the the third 15 I'm cutting it up  into 15 minute chunks and that's it 
[03:42:00]  that's smart so and then I'll just be  polishing those chunks and then the  bonus of that is too you you know for  example you do the third 15 and maybe  you struggle a little bit and you go this  doesn't pop like the first 15 and then  you make it pop like that now you got an  hour of every joke is an opener you know  what I mean and it's just like bang bang  bang yeah exactly and every every quarter  of that hour is something that could be  a closer you know what I mean she really  tentpolled at that point I had to I had 
[03:42:30]  it's so weird too to go through names for  your special what are you gonna call it  um I don't know if I want to reveal it  yet all right fair enough I can give you  the list of the names and you can pick  which one you think it's gonna be sure  you ready yeah the fuck is that thing  your phone's in that's a it's a one of  the best iPhone cases ever here we go  because it has this this sticky rubber  mat that you can peel your phone off and  put it back on no problem all right and  it has nothing on your phone okay it 
[03:43:00]  leaves no residue on your phone and it's  your wallet it's my wallet and it's my  phone case okay so especially when I  travel it protects the fucking thing but  then it keeps all my shit I like that  and it can flip around so you can talk  on it I love it it's fucking great I  just bought a new thing called the  crabby wallet off a Kickstarter that's  coming in a couple days which is an  elastic the all the material is elastic  made so you can put up to 10 cards in  this thing and it has a rubber band  cloth elastic to put your phone in so 
[03:43:30]  you attach your wallet to your phone it  doesn't fuck up your cards because it's  in the wallet and it has two different  slots you know for the cards you use  most and then the other cards that's  cool and it has a little thing on it  you can hook it up you can hook it up  on one of the what are those things  called the the fucking I have no idea  nice talking to you I literally had no  idea but just I just want to point out 
[03:44:00]  once again as I've pointed out many  times in the show do you see how you  use technology like like you treat it  like a whore you just as you're  describing that case as the best case  ever you're telling me about the case  you're going to replace it with that's  better I know have some fucking  respect I'm telling these designers  dude I'm tech talk Bobby brother and  you know what's so funny is that you're  in front of my stereo move over to the  left a little bit right now the other  way other way no no just go right back  to the middle right back right there
