<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a “Guess the Sound” segment featuring sexually explicit and graphic audio clips from a website called "Ghetto Gaggers."  The clips included sounds of oral sex, vomiting, and various sexual acts, described with offensive racial and disability slurs. Callers offered increasingly vulgar and humorous guesses, often involving interracial sex, rape, and defecation.

The show then transitioned to Anthony’s recounting of his luxurious Caribbean cruise vacation, detailing his owner’s suite, jacuzzi, balcony, and Paltalk broadcast of a ship tour.  He also described observing what he perceived as imminent rapes in a Caribbean bar.

Next, the hosts launched into humorous anecdotes about “gay” drinks, using homophobic slurs, including stories of a drink served in a goldfish bowl with a bleeding plastic shark and a strong green “leg splitter” marked with an X on the buyer's hand.  They then engaged in a profane comedic discussion of the song "The Devil Went Down to Georgia," interspersed with jokes about a late gift delivery to Jimmy Norton from Caroline's Comedy Club and discussions of Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains, along with a caller’s boast about their family tree tracing back to Thomas Jefferson.  No guests were explicitly identified besides the three hosts.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a caller, Jimmy, describing a massage that unexpectedly ended with a handjob, detailing the price negotiation and awkwardness. This led to the hosts and other callers sharing explicit anecdotes about their experiences with prostitutes and masseuses. Several callers attempted to establish themselves as recurring characters. One caller recounted a car accident caused by laughter during the show. XM Radio commercials were also interspersed throughout.

The broadcast continued with a variety of caller segments.  One caller repeatedly claimed to crash his car while listening, another expressed suicidal thoughts due to lacking an Xbox, and Big Kev offered inflatable kitty pools. Other callers introduced themselves with various self-proclaimed titles, like "call-the-show-totally-off-topic guy" and "unbelievably true head-shaking news guy." A caller's GTA 3 story was cut short, another admitted to lying to get on air, and a caller on hold for over an hour won an Aerosmith prize pack.  "What I Learned Today" listener feedback was included, along with Stephen Lynch performing an offensive song about superheroes and immigration.  More XM Radio advertisements, including Radio Hanukkah and sports coverage, were aired, along with an audio clip of Mike Brady awkwardly discussing his first kiss and a song about a first boner while watching Marsha Brady. The hosts discussed Anthony's worst on-air moments, including calling funeral homes and an Alzheimer's facility, a segment with a crying midget stripper, and a Boston appearance where an intoxicated Anthony facilitated a segment with “Wheelchair Fred,” resulting in Fred's fall and near-riot.  Big Kev, Wheelchair Fred, and various XM Radio personalities were mentioned, along with celebrities like Colin Hanks and Jack Black.

The show continued with a discussion of a disastrous live performance where the hosts were pelted with objects, forcing a hasty exit. This transitioned into a lengthy discussion of the hosts’ past blue-collar jobs, featuring detailed and often humorous anecdotes about warehouse and sheet metal shop work, injuries, workplace fights, alcoholism, and hazardous conditions. Opie briefly discussed his caddying experience.  Listener calls shared similar blue-collar experiences, interspersed with XM radio advertisements.  Anthony then experienced a toothache on air, describing his dental procedure in graphic detail while speaking with the hosts and a dentist on the phone.  Patrice O'Neill was present in the studio during this segment.

The broadcast included further graphic descriptions of Anthony's dental procedure, along with antisemitic and other bigoted remarks from the hosts and dentist. This was followed by a segment with Francine, who recounted a graphic miscarriage story and a first lesbian sexual encounter involving saran wrap.  The hosts decided to give Francine her own show.  XM radio advertisements and bits were also included.


Francine then shared a story titled "Really Desperate," detailing her painful experience with a large dildo, describing it as self-rape. The hosts and Francine engaged in humorous banter about the dildo and the experience.  This was followed by a game called "Match Wits with a Halfwit" with Francine as the contestant, resulting in comedically wrong answers. Opie recounted an embarrassing experience at a Mets game involving mistaken hand-holding and an awkward high-five with Danny, jokingly discussed as having gay implications.  The segment concluded with a song about a man’s preference for Black women.

[00:04:00]  Some kind of sick porno. 
[00:04:30]  Let's play Guess the Sound, everybody.  It's our new bit on the Opie and Anthony program, Guess the Sound.  This is a staple in regular radio, so we should start doing that as well.  If you turn down the music, we're going to play Guess the Sound.  Oh, yeah.  All right, I'm horrified at the prospect of what that could be. 
[00:05:00]  That's me after watching the Pink Panther trailer.  Is it an outtake from Brokeback Mountain, all right, that is definitely a man giving oral to another man who shoots in his mouth.  Now, whether it's in prison or, listen, you don't think it sounds like that.  Jesus good ears.  Oh, God. 
[00:05:30]  No, it sounds like someone puking.  That's not a guy giving head on, I think.  What's with that?  There's, like, head sounds in there.  See, I know what it is.  If you guys want to bet, that's what you say it is, Ant?  We're trying to get a betting show together, by the way, with Bodog.net.  Yeah.  Can we hear that one more time?  Because I think I know what it is.  All right, we're going to have people guess on the phones. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, yeah.  I know what it is.  What is it, Jimmy?  It's a man with Down syndrome being raped while he's drowning.  It could be.  See?  Oh, yeah.  He's trying to yell, help, what have I done?  Well, let's go to Shane.  Shane, guess the sound. 
[00:06:30]  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning.  You've got to talk like this if you're going to play guess the sound.  Play it guess the sound this morning.  Happy birthday, little Jimmy.  That bit is over, sir.  All right, that sound is the tranny throwing up in the corner while Jimmy whacks off.  Tranny throwing up in the corner while Jimmy whacks off.  Nothing?  Nothing.  Hold on.  I need my game show sounds.  I should have been ready here. 
[00:07:00]  Hold on.  I think we got a fucking laugh out of that one.  Nothing.  Nothing.  You stink.  The horizon tilts away from you.  As did any humor.  Thanks for playing guess the sound.  Let's go to Nick in Cleveland, Nick.  Guess the sound.  Guess the sound.  Oh.  That would be Steve deep-throating cock with perfect diction, I might ask.  Perfect diction.  Well, I did hear Steve there, but I don't think that was him of the clip. 
[00:07:30]  By the way, could someone get the answer for me?  I sort of have the answer, but I need more details.  Let's just put it that way.  Hold on.  We got a first timer.  Oh.  First timer.  Stacy?  Yeah.  What's up?  Hi, Stacy.  Nothing.  And I want to say what I think that sound is.  Okay.  I think it's a queeb.  A queeb.  Yeah.  What's a queeb?  A queeb. 
[00:08:00]  A pussy fart.  A queeb.  Queeb.  Yes.  Must be a girl thing.  Is that what they call it in Ohio?  What is it really called?  Queef.  A queef.  Right.  Thank you.  You got a queeb, you dope.  We call it a queef.  No, we call it a queeb.  No, you don't.  He was the fucking captain of the fucking cane mutiny.  Stupid.  Captain Queeb.  Strawberries.  How many portions did you have?  I knew there was a key somewhere in her burping vagina.  They made a key.  Captain Queeb.  They called me old Yellowstain. 
[00:08:30]  Old Yellowstain.  They sang songs about it.  Because I used to queeb in my underwear.  All right, Stacy.  That's right.  Hope Fred McMurray teabas, you stupid.  I never queebed and blew up that target.  She's wrecking our guest to sound.  She stinks.  I never cut the cable.  Queeb.  Dope.  Shane and Rocklin, guess the sound.  That is the sound of Bonnie after the first time she saw Rich Valson naked.  Go, Harry.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:09:00]  That's pretty good.  But you know what it is.  While she's doing that, you can hear him kissing Jay Moore's ass.  You can hear that.  That's what that sound is.  She's getting sick that her husband is groffling like that.  All right, let's go to Jeff in New Jersey.  Jeff, guess the sound.  All right, guys.  It's a black chick choking on a white man's cock.  Black chick choking on a white, a white chick.  What?  A black chick choking on a white man's cock. 
[00:09:30]  Hmm.  Hmm.  Is that really correct?  That's exactly what it is.  Wow.  Ding, ding, ding.  Why does it have to be a black chick?  It sounds that way.  It sounds like a black chick?  Yeah.  It sounds like a man.  You probably just saw the same website that I saw yesterday.  Oh, is that it?  Oh, really?  Oh, you came up with this, Danny?  Yeah, I found it.  I thought the audio was making me laugh all day, so I pulled it for you.  All right, a new bit.  Write this down. 
[00:10:00]  We want to start playing Guess the Sound.  Have a great day, guys.  We're going to start playing Guess the Sound, everybody.  But Wyatt, you would think it would be a black cock and a white chick.  You're trying to tell me that's a white cock black chick?  Yeah, it's from a website called Ghetto Gaggers.  All right.  I thought it was about pranks.  Could you guys put together a little Guess the Sound game for us in the coming days?  All right, here's the answer.  So it's a white guy, black girl, black girl taking the cock. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  That is a black chick making that blah sound?  Yeah, it is.  And it is a chick.  I checked because at first I thought it might, you know, because just by listening to it,  it kind of sounds like it could be a dude, but it's definitely not.  It certainly sounds like a dude.  It's so vag.  All right.  We're going to play Guess the Sound. 
[00:11:00]  Hopefully by Friday.  You guys should be able to put this together.  I want to play now.  So do I, Jimmy.  So do I.  All right.  I want to play now.  There you go.  There's that.  Fantastic.  Oh, motherfucker.  Sounded like Tom Sizemore.  Oh, wait.  Someone else wants to play Guess the Sound.  Let's go to Rev.  Rev?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hold on.  Let me cue up the sound again.  All right.  Because Rev wants to guess the sound. 
[00:11:30]  All right, Rev.  Is that Bubba signing his contract with Howard?  Wow.  Fuck it up.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  What a ghetto gagger she is.  She is really hot, too.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  She's a ghetto gagger.  Ghetto gaggers. 
[00:12:00]  That's wonderful.  We work with some sick fucks, I got to tell you.  How you doing?  This is Club Soda Kenny.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony, which ain't that bad.  But it's time to play Guess the Sound.  This is going to be a full feature on the Opie and Anthony show, but we're trying it out live on the show right now.  Thank God.  Here's the second sound for today.  It's called Guess the Sound.  There's no reason we can't do an occasional hack bit.  Why not?  And we like when the listeners guess the sound.  Yes. 
[00:12:30]  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  You know what it is.  No, but it's great.  It sounds like it's Pat.  Wow, that is really something. 
[00:13:00]  I'm going to have to hear that again.  That was my impression of Pat, by the way.  Yeah, it was?  Thank you.  It was pretty good, I thought.  Thanks.  I know what it is.  Don't, don't spoil it.  All right.  I'm going to say what it is.  All right.  Wait, no, no.  One, one more time.  One more time.  And I might have it.  It's Guess the Sound. 
[00:13:30]  I love this new game.  Okay.  Is that an Asian woman?  Okay.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  I'll give it away.  I'm just guessing.  We want listeners to guess, too.  I already know one of these, so I'm not going to blow it.  Just guessing.  She sounded that.  She was like, yeah, that could be anything.  Her walking in those wacky shoes with her feet all bound up, big backpack full of rice 
[00:14:00]  and a baby.  I don't know.  You want to know what it is?  Fucking, I'll blow it.  It's Dak from Enemy Mind chewing Saran Wrap while raping Shelley Duvall.  No, I don't think that's it.  Word is coming in that that isn't it.  Well, pal talk. 
[00:14:30]  Anger.  Pal talk.  They're trying to guess.  Can you go up a little bit?  There's a couple good ones.  Anger.  Wow.  He does Dak.  One person's guessing.  Terry Schiavo getting banged with a tennis ball.  All right.  No, you want to go the other way now.  It's Stalker Patty getting her snatch waxed. 
[00:15:00]  Fucking hate that.  Someone said it's a big-nosed DJ dropping carts all over his records.  No.  It's Rev from Whackbag.  Rev, guess the sound.  Hello again.  I'm guessing it's you, O.B., checking the stock prices for Citadel.  Ow!  Our Citadel stock, O.B.?  I haven't paid attention to that.  I keep tabs on it.  It's the same place it was at a year ago and right after we bought it. 
[00:15:30]  Just hanging there at 12.  Thank you for reading.  Thank you.  Anthony?  Play it again.  Okay.  Wait a minute.  First of all, I want that sound on my instant replay.  One more time.  I think I have some of it.  The phone's crapped out, by the way.  Okay.  That's a great sound. 
[00:16:00]  The thud, thud, thud noise is throwing me, but I think I got it.  You do?  I think I do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I think I know the other thud, thud, thud noise.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  Are we ready?  No one wants to try to get it again?  No, they want to play.  The phone's blew up.  Uh-huh. 
[00:16:30]  We're getting a lot of the same answer.  What a horrible time for the phones to blow up.  Um, no, it's not Beth auditioning for her MasterCard commercial.  Golden shower in a sleeping girl's mouth?  It's not a golden shower?  No.  Oh, okay.  There goes my guess.  I thought it was mine, too.  There goes mine, too.  Nope.  Nope.  I still have my guess.  Well, we wanted to go to the phones, but there's no way to get the phones back and running. 
[00:17:00]  What do we do?  We just...  We sit here like idiots.  Wait a minute.  Um.  Are you kidding me?  We can't go to the phones?  This is our big phone bit.  Well, I'll...  It was scheduled for this time.  Maybe we can play it one more time because the crackling is what's throwing everybody off.  I got it. 
[00:17:30]  Fucking...  It was throwing me off for a second.  Yeah?  Yeah?  Yes.  What is it?  It is a, um...  It's a woman, and she's walking on, um, bubble wrap.  The plastic bubble wrap.  Yeah.  And at the very end of the bubble wrap, um, she falls and her vagina gets caught in something.  That is ridiculous.  The bubble wrap.  I'm thinking the, um, the crinkling you're hearing is some type of plastic. 
[00:18:00]  No.  It isn't like something laid down to protect?  Nope.  It's not a rad bag?  You know, Asian.  Wow, this is tough.  Well...  Is liquid shit involved?  Not liquid.  All right.  Oh, no.  Okay.  I was going to guess...  Is that a crackling shit?  Is that a crackling shit?  Yeah, that is...  Because I was going to guess that, but you said no to the toilet stuff before. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, no.  No, he said no to piss.  Oh, it sounds like a crackling shit.  That is a woman, an Asian woman, whose face is being shit on.  Perhaps.  Wow.  Perhaps.  While she's sleeping?  No, she's not sleeping.  She's being forced to lay there and endure it.  Hey, wait.  Is she shitting on herself?  No, it's a fat guy.  Fat guy shitting on her?  All right.  Where's the video?  Please let me see this.  Now we got to see it.  I thought that sounded like a crackling shit. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, it was...  No!  Oh, my God.  The sound a human only makes when being shit on, by the way.  Or burned in a car fire.  By the way, this woman, when she was growing up, wanted to be a ballerina.  Your father's not happy.  I know.  You grow up, you lay, man shit on face. 
[00:19:30]  Man shit on you.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  All right.  Get your dicks out, boys.  Here we go.  Here we go.  And buffering, buffering, buffering, buffering.  Bridal shower, it's called.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Oh, no.  No.  No.  No.  Oh, he's missed.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  It's like a Mr. Softy machine. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, no.  She really seems to be enjoying that.  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Yeah.  What happened?  Where did you go wrong?  What do you mean, where'd you go wrong?  Where'd you go wrong?  You know how many girls she had to beat out for this role?  Yeah.  Blowing off third period seemed like a good idea at the time.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Oh, she's following it.  Oh, my God.  Why can't we get the...  What would you do, Wasted?  Why can't we get the rest of the audio? 
[00:20:30]  I mean, why can't we get audio on this?  Oh, she's going back for more?  Or is that just...  No, she went back for more.  No, it's the best part of this video.  That they're doing that cube thing to the guy's balls because that's too outrageous.  Yeah, that's a bit much.  The Japanese...  What is it called again?  The pixelated.  They're pixelated in the guy's ball bag and his junk because that's too outrageous for everybody.  Why is she dressed as a bride?  Is that their honeymoon?  Well, I don't get it.  Is it the way they... 
[00:21:00]  Maybe she wanted to go to Hershey Park and they lost the plane tickets.  I mean, obviously, the clip was a lot longer.  Yeah.  But I want to just isolate the part where you hear the poo coming out.  Her scream is the best thing.  It's her little, like...  Whatever that is.

If you purchased an energy-efficient air conditioner or storm doors in 2006,  or plan to make your home more energy-efficient in 2007,  you may qualify for a tax credit.  I'm Brigitte Yule with the Bankrate.com Personal Finance Minute. 
[00:23:30]  The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provided tax credits for consumers  who invest in many types of home improvements.  These include adding insulation, replacing windows and doors,  air conditioning and heating systems, and water heaters.  Unlike a deduction which reduces the amount of income subject to tax,  a tax credit directly reduces the tax itself.  The tax credits for home improvements are capped at $500 per homeowner.  Not every product with the Energy Star label qualifies. 
[00:24:00]  The website EnergyStar.gov does an excellent job of explaining  what improvements qualify for the credit and how much the credit will be.  And it's all in the language the layman can understand.  For more tips and personal finance topics, visit Bankrate.com.  I'm Brigitte Yule.  January 1st, 2007, NASCAR Radio becomes XM Sports Nation.

I was just wondering if you guys heard about that car accident over up here in Boston about the president,  the moose.  Uh, some dude. 
[00:26:00]  I think it was a girl.  Oh, my God.  I know what you're talking about.  I think it was in yesterday's paper or Saturday's paper.  Some girl on the highway outside Lemonster.  I have no idea really what it was.  I'm trying to be local for the people in that area.  It was a little bit of a story.  Uh.  Yeah.  And the moose, I don't know how it happened, but the-  Crashes into-  Energy or whatever.  Yeah.  Sorry, go ahead.  That blasted the moose, and the moose ends up sitting in the passenger seat with its head  out of the windshield, looking around, and it couldn't move, and they had to kill it because  they couldn't-  You've got to see this picture. 
[00:26:30]  It's one of the greatest pictures you'll ever see.  Really?  The video is even as funny because-  Woman crashes into moose, goes through the, uh, yeah, right through the windshield and  all that, and exactly what he said, the moose is sitting in the passenger seat with the  head sticking out-  Wow.  ...of the, of the windshield, like it was, that's how they were driving the whole time.  Do you, do you know how much she must-  Do you know, I, I, I've yelled in my life, but do you know how much you scream when one minute  you're listening to the radio, and the next minute, a moose is sitting next to you with  his head through the windshield? 
[00:27:00]  Imagine-  You would have to have a heart attack.  Imagine if there was someone with him.  Especially if you got a ticket for not having a belt on.  If we can find the picture, I, I meant to bring it in, we should have scanned it for  the website.  It's unbelievable.  And then they had a crane to try to get the, the moose out of the vehicle, and unfortunately  it had a broken hip or something.  They had a-  Yeah.  They had a-  You're kidding!  They had to do that euthanization.  Euthanization.  And then they have to shoot the moose in your car.  Oh.  If they kill a moose in your car and then drag its carcass back through the windshield.  That's going to really hurt the resale value.  And you know it's shit.  You know the moose shit all over the car. 
[00:27:30]  Shit all over before he died.  Hey, we got, we got the papers from the weekend, uh, in the office.  We might have it in there.  Oh, okay.  Fucking poor moose is walking along.  Next thing you know, you're sitting next to a screaming fat lady in Boston.  It's one of the-  Hey, Rook.  Nothing up my sleeve.  Where's the rest of this moose?  I must have hated that moose.  Why don't you forget the moose?  Arthur.  We got the pictures of the moose sitting nice.  The moose looks ridiculous.  It really does.  What an ass this moose looks like. 
[00:28:00]  It's like, what goes through the moose's head?  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  What a windshield?  What happened?  What a goose this moose looks like.  He was looking at him.  He got a light in his face.  All he wanted to do was eat a berry.  Next thing you know, he's fucking in a Fiat.  He's a fucking asshole bleeding.  How silly does that moose look?  That is a silly looking moose.  Can somebody tell the moose, the car doesn't fit you, Mr. Moose? 
[00:28:30]  Look at me.  The moose has too many friends that are afraid.  That's like Tom Cruise.  They're too afraid to tell him, you look like a silly goose, Mr. Moose.  Mr. Moose, wouldn't it be fun to hit the washer and watch him go, like shake his little moose head?  Like the last thing that could possibly annoy him is a little jet of water in his face.  I would hate to have that moose in my car because he puts right through the windshield.  If it rains, it's going to get all over the place.  And plus the moose probably goes duty all over the seat.  And you have a wet moose at the end of the whole thing.  Do you know how scared the moose must have been right there? 
[00:29:00]  I just hope the car was still driving and someone actually saw this taking place before she finally slowed down.  I would find the nearest toll booth.  Right.  They shot Mr. Moose in the causeway.  He's dead.  Look how they massacred my moose.  I hope one guy, as this moose drove by, was a little high.  Yeah.  I hope there was one a little high person that went right to an N.A. meeting because he saw a moose in the vehicle. 
[00:29:30]  You don't even have to be a little high.  I hope it was just a carload of people completely sober, but only one guy saw it past them and had to tell his friends what he saw, and no one believes him.  No, I did.  There was a moose in the passenger seat.  Shut up, stupid.  And his face was hanging out the windshield.  I swear to you.  That's mean.  It was probably just a boy with Down syndrome.  No, I'm telling you.  It was like Dino.  He looks like Dino.  Yes. 
[00:30:00]  It looks like Dino in Fred's car.  I feel horrible for the moose because his moose arms are all jammed up.  They're folded under himself.  He can't even open the glove box.  Poor fucking moose.  He's probably so scared and in pain and in shock, but look, it's an accident.  So, I mean, if I were her, I would have jerked off on the moose's head.  That's what I would have done if I showed up.  Because no one in recorded history has ever jerked off onto the face of a moose as it sat in the passenger seat of a car.  No one.  Now, Jimmy, we have to research that. 
[00:30:30]  I'll bet you somebody's raped the moose.  I'll bet you some farmer in Canada, of course, climbed up and fucked a moose after he hit it.  No one's ever jerked off on the face of a moose while it just sat there and took it.  Hey, this is Howie Mandel.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  So, Anthony, how was your vacation?  I had such a wonderful cruise, Opie.  I cruised the seas on the adventure of the sea, of the seas, Royal Caribbean, out of Puerto Rico.  And then from Puerto Rico, went to Aruba, and then Curaçao, and then up to St. Martin and St. Thomas, and then back to Puerto Rico. 
[00:31:00]  So, you're a couple of days, you know, at sea, just kind of cruising around, and then you get on the island, you get to the beach, a lot of drinks, things like that.  At night, it's all about the lovely dinners and the three-deck huge dining rooms.  People take care of you amazingly, and then you go to the casino, you gamble, make some friends. 
[00:31:30]  Do you feel crowded on the boat?  I've never taken.  They are so ridiculously huge these days.  The cabins now, on the adventure, which isn't even the new one, they got this new Freedom class of ship coming out.  That is, it's ridiculous big, where it makes all, it dwarfs other cruise ships.  The ones that are out there now, huge.  And every room now, they used to have, like, some really shitty rooms, bottom, like lower decks, deck three, where you'd have a little porthole. 
[00:32:00]  Now, every frigging room has a balcony, so you could get outside now.  They figured that out.  This one adventure has got this big, like, Broadway running through the middle of it with stores and shops, big vaulted ceiling that goes up 100 feet.  Do you forget you're on a boat?  Yeah, a lot of times, it's a huge luxury hotel.  The hallways now, and it used to be older cruise ships, the hallways, when you're getting to your cabin, were kind of thin. 
[00:32:30]  Now, they've widened those out.  They've made, you know, he's got a couple of things.  It's an amazing, lavish, very classy ship.  First class in the ship?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  There are different classes of cabins.  You know, there's the owner's suites, and then there's the royal suite.  What's an owner's suite?  Owner's suite is what I had.  There's, like, ten of them on the whole ship.  And they're, of course, they're, like, they're very good. 
[00:33:00]  They've got widescreen TVs in them, a lot of room, big balconies, showers, jacuzzis.  This is definitely fun for the faithful listeners to see how we have grown in our careers.  But it's, I have the most fun with this, I have to tell you.  Come on, you saw me with my Dodge Ares K car at Spooky World in Boston when we left after the gig,  and Opie thought my car was an abandoned car in the woods.  I had parked.  Spooky World was so packed that day that I had to park in the woods, kind of. 
[00:33:30]  And we were kind of late, so I ran.  Not kind of.  You know how you make your own spots at events and sporting events or what have you.  So I made it kind of in the woods, which was fine by me.  The parking lot was packed.  But we stay so late, we're kind of hanging out, having a good time,  that by the time we left, all the cars were gone, except for mine, Opie's, and maybe two more.  So I start walking over to my car, he goes, where are you going?  I go, my car, he goes, dude, I thought that was an abandoned car in the fucking woods.  It was an old, rusted Dodge Ares K car. 
[00:34:00]  I just can't believe Anthony stayed for something after, like, it was over, you didn't get out a minute later.  That was the old days.  Wow.  Although I got to tell you, on this vacation, I pretty much did everything I hadn't done in years.  Yeah.  It was eating poorly, drinking like crazy.  The only thing I didn't do was smoke.  Three, oh.  But, oh, shut up your ass.  It was smoke.  But, uh.  How do you know what I was going to say?  I barely said anything.  I heard enough.  All right. 
[00:34:30]  But this is mostly fun for me, I have to admit.  So the owner's suite is like the best one.  Is that better than the other one?  No, there's a royal suite that I tried to book, but the thing is booked up three years in advance.  What?  It has a piano in it.  Oh, for why?  What did he get for?  Because it's a digital piano.  You put it in and it plays like you don't even need a piano player.  Exactly.  You don't need a piano either.  And you hold parties.  It looks like a ghost is playing.  Yeah.  Now look.  The keys actually go down.  You hold parties?  What, just you alone?  I have my entire family there. 
[00:35:00]  With the piano?  Sir.  And then you hold a party in your room.  You have it catered by the ship.  And they bring in lovely hors d'oeuvres and things and drinks.  And you come in and there's a bar in your room and everything.  How many people are on the ship?  On the ship?  50.  Probably about three, between 3,000, 3,500.  Wow.  And there's enough room for all those people.  Dude, you don't even understand how big this is.  See, I'm such a newbie with this crap. 
[00:35:30]  Take the ship.  Stand it up on its end.  It's like the Chrysler building.  It's ridiculous.  It's huge.  Every port we'd pull into, all the other ships were dwarfed.  You've got rock climbing walls.  The new ship has a surf, you can surf and boogie board on the back of the ship.  There's an actual pool that makes a wave that you surf on.  It's giant.  What do you mean?  Multiple pools.  Oh, on the ship.  Yeah, on the ocean. 
[00:36:00]  No, you're not in the ocean.  They just fling you overboard.  It's great.  And dinner is another thing.  They have formal night.  Two nights out of the seven are formal night where you all dress in.  Gowns and tuxedos.  Preferably tuxes if you're a guy.  Gowns if you're a girl.  Right.  I guess that's open to suggestions.  Two tuxes if you're a lesbian couple.  Right.  And it's formal night.  And it's so luxurious.  Everything was good.  I had, as an appetizer one night, something that was nothing more than what amounted to beef bouillon. 
[00:36:30]  You ever take a beef cube and put it in boiling water when you were starving in college and eat that?  It was luxurious.  It was the best broth I ever had.  Yeah, that's, look at that.  That's the boogie boarding thing that is on one of the ships.  So, wait, you had, your appetizer was Robert Reed's last meal.  That's nice. 
[00:37:00]  They had you a curled up tissue and a tear catcher.  We all, it was robe night.  Now, let me ask you, do you, now, when you're in first class or as you're in, you know, like, fucking somewhere between Elton John and fucking the Queen's class,  and do they give you different food or do you have the same food?  You have the same food because it's all in the same dining rooms.  There are three tiers of dining rooms.  It's huge but very luxurious and everybody is treated like a king in a dining room.  Is your room big?  Did you have a jacuzzi in your room? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, yeah, the room was pretty big.  King bed?  Uh, yeah.  Was your room bigger than this studio?  Um, yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Was it as big as this office?  It was pretty big.  No, not as big as the office.  You're on a ship, for God's sake.  They got to fit in a lot of people.  What kind of pillows?  Do they have feather pillows?  Yes, feather pillows.  When you first get on, you have to do the life drill where you get your life jackets and got to stand out there on the deck with everybody.  It's a pain in the ass.  Yes, you do that. 
[00:38:00]  And then once you do that, you're free to do whatever the hell you want on the boat.  And it's great.  And like I said, dinner.  You grease enough for the guys that come over.  And I guess that's where you're talking about different classes if the people eat better than the others.  You slip some money to these people, you get anything you want.  They bring you more of this, more of that, champagne, some Dom Perignon, fucking 300 bottles of, dollar bottles of wine.  It's great.  At the meal or in your cabin?  The cantaloupe. 
[00:38:30]  They bring you the sliced cantaloupe.  It's wonderful.  And prosciutto.  It's amazing.  Yeah, you just got to grease them a little bit.  Wait, can you get room service 24 hours?  Yeah.  Room service 24 hours.  You have your personal stateroom attendant that makes the cute little, you come back all hammered from the casino.  It's three in the morning.  You walk in and there's a towel monkey swinging from a hanger wearing your sunglasses.  They make little animals.  One day we come in.  What's on the bed? 
[00:39:00]  It's a penguin with two chocolates on his head for us.  Eric's laughing.  He was just on a cruise though.  That's what they do.  They make little things.  They make it fun.  It's fun and they treat you like kings.  Anthony, wear shark jocks.  You shouldn't be admitting that there's a penguin towel on your bisexual bird.  It's wonderful.  One day he made a scary bat.  It was wonderful.  It was very funny.  What happened to you?  I mean from two weeks ago what happened to you.  Really?  What?  They treat you like king. 
[00:39:30]  It's wonderful.  And then.  I think he went to the University of Faggots while we were gone.  And it was great that they make the towel into a cock and you can bend over and sit on it.  It doesn't even break.  It's a lot of fun.  It's a wonderful time.  They give you your own slave.  That's what you get on that fucking thing.  It's like a belly warmer.  They pretty much do.  Yeah.  It's a black guy with his arm out and a little towel hanging.  Well, they are very dark people that work the ships and all the ports. 
[00:40:00]  Were they nice to you though?  They are amazing.  Anything you want.  Because when you go down the Caribbean, they're not as nice.  No.  There's a little racist thing going on.  No.  They don't want to serve you.  No.  This is fantastic.  They treat you like royalty.  They really do.  And I had my laptop with me and a camera and I have internet access in the middle of the ocean.  High speed.  It's wonderful.  High speed on the Wi-Fi, which is certain areas of the ship. 
[00:40:30]  In your stateroom, it's dial up.  Okay.  But it was good enough for me to get online a few times.  And I went to the Wi-Fi area up on the main, like, there's the 14th floor.  On the 14th floor.  Jesus.  Overlooks.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  Overlooks the entire front of the ship or the midship where the pool area is and everything.  So I'm sitting up there having a drink.  And I log on Wi-Fi.  I got the camera.  I go on to Pal Talk.  And, of course, Opie and Anthony room.  There's constantly at least 200, 250 people in it. 
[00:41:00]  So I log on.  And I'm kind of panning the room.  And they're all making jokes because one of the waiter comes over.  And they just start saying.  I had to turn the volume down.  Ramon, get Anthony a drink.  He's a fancy man.  Hey, colored gentlemen, why aren't you moving faster?  I'm, like, hitting the volume button.  And the guy's like, what is this you're watching?  I go, oh.  And I put the camera right in his face. 
[00:41:30]  And they're like, who's the monkey giving you a drink?  Just awful, racist Pal Talk people.  Why did they write these things about me?  Why?  Why did they write these things?  Why did they call me Mikey?  No, no, no.  No, no.  This is a bad speller.  Right, right, right.  But I had the camera there.  So they were watching.  And I took them on a tour of the boat.  I looked like a lunatic because I'm carrying around my laptop and a camera.  And I'm walking through the hallways.  And I got lost a couple times.  And one said, heavy machinery.  Do not enter.  And they're taunting me to go in the room. 
[00:42:00]  And then I'm just kind of walking around.  And I would pass.  They were playing a video game with you.  Yeah.  Some guy said.  He goes, dude, this is like playing Doom.  I'm just walking around.  And you see a hot chick laying down.  And I kind of focus on that and have to leave.  And people go, no, put it back.  And I can't hover over a girl with a camera.  Hi, what's your name?  So they just kept walking.  Gave them a little tour until the Wi-Fi ran out.  But they enjoyed it. 
[00:42:30]  It was a little tour of the ship.  And it was a lot of fun.  After that, it's pretty much beach.  A lot of laying down on the beach.  A lot of drinks with rum and banana.  I had something called a banana bye-bye.  It's like a banana daiquiri with Baileys in it.  And bye-bye.  You drink a couple of them.  Boop.  You're out.  Was that the faggiest drink you've ever had?  No.  I was drinking some kind of champagne and peach schnapps thing at the champagne bar. 
[00:43:00]  It was the faggiest drink I ever had.  You see how they pour it?  A guy actually stands over and yanks it out of his cock.  He stores it in his balls.  But in a very classy way.  What was the name of the faggiest drink you've ever drank?  Wow.  Faggiest drink.  Because you just reminded me of something.  I don't know if I've told this story on the air and I'll have to throw myself under the bus.  Wonderful.  What was the name of the faggiest drink you've ever drank in your life?  Cum.  The cum-a-tini? 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, it was some type of martini.  Well, mine is a tini.  I had some kind of chocolate martini.  But it was named something else I can't remember.  But very faggoty.  Yeah.  Well, you don't remember the name, though?  No.  Oh, my God.  Well, last summer I went on vacation with Lindsay's family at her banks, North Carolina.  Just rent a house on the beach.  You have to, like, four-wheel in on the beach, like, for miles just to get to your house.  And I'm very nervous.  Very nervous going on vacation with Lindsay and her family. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Because we didn't spend that much quality time together in the beginning of the relationship.  They had to accept me for who I was.  Of course.  And they finally did, which is great.  We all get along now.  But down there in the Outer Banks, we go out to dinner.  And it's literally the first time, I think, that we all sat down for a dinner.  So my nerves are just out of control.  What's the note?  Seabreeze, like Howie. 
[00:44:30]  Thank you, Iraq.  That really helped the discussion.  Wow.  What are you talking about?  It's the note I was just pet.  Oh, he was in such a good mood.  Oh.  How quick did that?  How long did your vacation last, Iraq?  That tan turned to red.  He's back in the shitter.  You made it an hour and a half, Iraq. 
[00:45:00]  What can I tell you?  I was talking about the cruise.  He was on one, so he's like, yeah, I got a little penguin in my room, too.  Two minutes later, he's a piece of shit.  He was walking around all morning just whistling.  He had a nice tan, a smile on his face.  That lasted an hour and a half.  Oh, God.  They're just shaking their heads in the other room.  It was just, it was an odd, it was an odd thing to do just because of the placement.  If you can't see in the studio, the Iraq just walked behind open kind of hand.  It was just an odd, you know, moment to do it. 
[00:45:30]  Did I order my coffee, by the way?  I forgot.  I bring nothing to the table.  Oh, can I get a 2% dry cappuccino, please?  Grande?  That's the fag.  I was just going to say.  No, no, no, no.  So we all went out to dinner, and we were kind of like breaking bread, you know, finally,  like it was our first dinner together.  It was Lindsey and I and our two brothers, who I forgot to wish a happy birthday before  we went on break, AJ and Kenny, sorry. 
[00:46:00]  That would have cost, yeah.  Yeah.  What?  She forgot the name.  Huh?  Forget the name?  No, no.  Family points.  No, I just felt bad that I forgot to wish them a happy birthday before we went on break.  I promised them I would.  They're huge fans of the show, and so we're sitting there, and then it's like Lindsey's  uncle and his family, so it's a big deal.  We're sitting down, right?  And it's time for the drink water, right?  And Lindsey's father, you know, he's a man's man. 
[00:46:30]  Scotch.  God damn it.  He's a man's man.  Scotch whiskey.  It's all about beer, beer, and more beer.  A man's man.  And I'm looking at the drink menu, not even thinking.  Not even thinking, right?  And all of a sudden, it's like beer, beer, beer, beer, beer around the table, right?  All the men are drinking beer.  And it comes to me, and I'm not even really listening that they all just ordered beer.  And I go, I'll have a bikini teeny. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Lindsey, like, does a double take, looks at me like, are you fucking crazy?  Way to break the New York faggot image they probably had.  I wish I knew how to quit you.  It looked delicious on the drink menu.  It had everything I like.  You don't drink it, they just bend you over and splash it on your back. 
[00:47:30]  And it came in a faggotty glass, and the color was just, everything just said faggotty.  You have some audio from the waiter.  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you, you ever suck a guy's cock?  Show me with your mouth.  Show me with your mouth.  And here's a suggestion, I guess, from the waiter on the ways you can have the drink.  You can get a doggie style and get a lean on your side.  Those are your only choices.  This is my house, and I get the same.  But it's like, why? 
[00:48:00]  Why couldn't I just say beer?  I like beer.  I enjoy beer.  You didn't have to go to the bikini-tini.  But I'm looking at the drink menu, and you're not even thinking, like, wow, look at all  the fruit juices it has in it, and it has rum.  Two different kinds of rum, dark rum and regular rum.  Do you want to kiss me, or am I going to kiss you on the mouth?  So around the table, beer, beer, beer, beer.  I'll have a bikini-tini. 
[00:48:30]  Show you.  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  Can I bring you a bikini-tini?  And you shows up with a nice piece of fruit over the fag of the glass.  Of course it does.  His name was Brad.  And a cute straw and a stupid kind of umbrella thing.  They're all drinking their beers, and I'm, like, sipping on my bikini-tini.  And I could see it in Lindsey's father's face, like, the disappointment.  The disappointment.  Well, I won't be getting any grandkids.  The disappointment. 
[00:49:00]  And Lindsey's giving me a double take, like, you decide now to have a bikini-tini?  Bikini-tini.  Just when things are going great.  You could seal the deal by just getting a beer and clinking glasses, and you get this  fucking drink.  Computer Stein.  So then, so now I'm just in a pure panic, and it's time for another, you know, round.  And now I just go complete opposite way.  I'm like, oh.  Heroin.  I'll have a schlitz in a can.  Oh, there you go.  And then, I'm not even kidding.  I went from bikini-tini to schlitz in a can.  And now, Lindsey's like, are you feeling okay? 
[00:49:30]  What the hell?  You know, I'm sweating.  One extreme to the other there.  Because I'm trying to make a good impression.  Now you're trying to compensate.  So now I'm drinking schlitz in a can.  The worst thing about any kind of martini, which there are 8,000 of now.  It used to just be the martini.  Now, at the very end, have some kind of a chocolate martini, other kind of martini.  Right.  Can it please be put in a glass that isn't what amounts to a plate on a stem? 
[00:50:00]  It is the hardest fucking drink not to spill all over yourself.  What's the degree?  It's like 170 degrees of angle on the glass.  And you're trying to hold it.  And, you know, usually you have to be a drunk to drink these things.  Right.  It's spilling.  So your stability is not too good to begin with.  Try it on a ship that's lurching a little bit.  I'm walking with my chocolate martini. 
[00:50:30]  My hand is soaked.  Wait, you can feel the ship moving?  A little bit.  Some days.  Some nights.  A little bit.  Do you get seasick?  No.  I used to.  But it doesn't move like a boat moving.  Like if I go on somebody's 35-footer, something like that,  and the water gets rough, I'll be a puking motherfucker.  But on one of these ships, it just feels kind of like the ground's moving a little bit.  It doesn't.  You don't get that, whoa, whoa. 
[00:51:00]  Do they sell Dramamine on the boat?  They have to.  Oh, yeah.  Everything you need.  And if Dramamine ain't good enough, you go down to sickbay,  they'll give you some kind of anti-psychotic that cuts off all kinds of things to your brain  that'll make you seasick.  But more people get sick from drinking than they do seasick.  They have all kinds of stabilizers on these things that are amazing.  I want to take a closer look.  The water can be really rough.  You know, they don't even have like the old days, the older days.  They used to have propellers coming out the back with propeller shafts. 
[00:51:30]  And to make the boat vibrate, now they've got electric pods, four of them,  on the bottom of these boats.  With GPS, they never have to drop anchor.  They could sit in one spot in the water just with these pods on the bottom of the ship  that turn 180 degrees.  They're a whole like special on the boat.  You could sit there and watch it.  It's amazing.  Just amazing technology.  I want to take a cruise.  You would love it.  It's so relaxing.  You love the luxurious hotels and stuff, right? 
[00:52:00]  The fancy hotels.  And the best part of it, you go to, let's say you're on Aruba.  You don't want to stay there.  Like, if you're on Aruba for a week, you might run out of things to do.  You know, you get a little bored with the atmosphere.  You go on to the same beach, things like that.  By the time you're done, you're on your ship.  Your hotel now takes you to some other beach.  You go to sleep.  You wake up.  Hey, I'm in St. Thomas.  You go to the beach there.  You do the things there. 
[00:52:30]  You come back.  You gamble.  You do whatever.  You go to sleep.  You wake up.  Hey, you're somewhere else.  It's kind of great, you know?  You get a little varied atmospheres.  And it's all luxury.  I like luxury.  Luxury rocks.  This guy from Chicago says he was on the same ship as you.  Oh!  Guy from Chicago.  Couple of fans on the boat.  Hey there, Pally.  How you doing?  All right.  Were you the guy that kept wanting to take a picture but didn't have a camera?  That's me. 
[00:53:00]  How awkward is it?  What's that?  Hey, you know how awkward that is?  Hey, man, can I take a picture?  Yeah, sure.  I don't have a camera.  All right.  I'll see you amongst the 3,500 people.  That was my wife's job to have it.  That's all right.  I will say there was a group of us sitting at the bar.  We did see you carrying your chocolate martini in your tuxedo.  Yes, I was in my tux carrying my chocolate martini.  You really had a tuxedo?  On formal light?  Oh, yes, he did.  He brought it with you?  No.  I was the only one that knew who he was.  So here are my buddies. 
[00:53:30]  They're saying, look at this guy with the chocolate.  They saw you put your bet down on the roulette table, lose, get pissed, and grab a chocolate  martini.  Wait, which bet was that?  I didn't bet roulette.  I was playing hold'em.  Oh, I did play roulette.  You leaned over, you looked, you were uncertain, you threw it down real quick, and walked away.  Yeah, I was waiting for the hold'em table to open up.  That's right.  And it wasn't open.  So I threw a bet on black, and it came in red.  What time can you gamble until there?  Three in the morning.  Three.  When they close down. 
[00:54:00]  A lot of hold'em.  Playing a lot of hold'em.  It was that or three card poker.  It was a hard table to get on.  Well, did you get your picture with Ant?  I got it.  All right.  Where do you get your tuxedo from?  You rent it on the boat.  The tailor comes to your room and measures you, and then the next day, hanging in your closet  is a lovely tuxedo.  How much is it to rent it?  I don't know.  I think it's 90 bucks for two days.  That's not bad.  That's not bad at all.  Less than I paid, 200.  And you get two shirts, so you're not wearing the same shirt and socks. 
[00:54:30]  Can you smoke everywhere or no?  How much was that?  There are designated smoking areas on the boat, and there's enough of them where the smokers  aren't pissed off.  And then the islands, you know, they don't care where you smoke on those savage islands.  They don't care.  How long are you on the islands for?  Anywhere.  Some days, you'll dock at eight in the morning, and the ship will leave at six at night.  So you have the entire day there.  Others, like Arubu, we were there from early in the morning, like eight in the morning 
[00:55:00]  until one in the morning, like the next morning.  So it's like all day and all night.  Did you look for her?  Went to the bar.  Went to Carlos and Charlie's.  Yeah.  Hung out there.  Had some, what the hell was I drinking there?  I think banana daiquiris.  Drinking there.  But that place is just a madhouse of rape waiting to happen.  Dude, it's all it is.  There's an upper balcony.  Where me, my friend Buddy, we're hanging out, looking over the edge of this balcony at just future rapes on the floor. 
[00:55:30]  One girl, some drunk blonde with half her shirt hanging off, drinking her hand, woo, doing the woo dance with her arms up in the air.  With five guys around her.  Not the woo dance.  Humping her ass.  Not the woo dance.  Doing the ass hump dance.  But there are five of them.  And they're all trying to vie for any attention.  So the second, like, she made eye contact with one, the one would be with the other ones. 
[00:56:00]  Like, hey, she wants me, motherfuckers.  And they'd have to, like, go off and try to find another rape victim.  You just know there's just rape going on down there.  Drunk woo girls.  It was different.  Woo!  All right, Chicago.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Tim, what's up?  Hey, Tim.  Tim!  I did push it.  Let's try it again.  Tim?  Yeah.  Hi, Tim.  There you are.  What's up?  How are you guys doing? 
[00:56:30]  All right.  It's good to be back.  I just wanted to call in and share my shame of ordering a faggy drink.  Yeah, see, I'm not alone.  I hate when I freaking admit this shit and no one comes to the table.  No, I went out with my wife's family.  Same type of thing.  Everybody's getting man drinks and shit.  And I ordered an Oasis Daydreamer.  Oasis Daydreamer.  I'll have an Oasis Daydreamer.  It's in pink.  See, here's the problem.  Just so I could clear.  Here's the problem.  That's all I got, guys.  But here's the problem with the faggy drinks. 
[00:57:00]  It's like you look at the drink menu, and it just looks delicious.  Tasty beverage.  It looks delicious.  Yes.  There should be another way to be able to order the drink.  Call it a number two.  Call it a number three.  Well, the chocolate martini is the number two.  That's why we get the big bucks.  We're so smart.  I actually refuse to say funny names like that.  I refuse.  Like, when you're an honest guy, I will not say the name.  Like, let me have that one.  I'll point on the board.  Because, like, the other, the Wukka Dukka chocolate cake. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, go fuck yourself.  I've not ordered stuff that I've wanted because of the name.  Point at it, dude.  I go this.  I go the Wukka Dukka.  I go this right here.  This.  I refuse to say it.  This.  And it's not out of being masculine.  It's out of stop trying to be fucking funny on your menus, motherfuckers.  But stop trying to make me laugh and be different.  It's a funny name, the Wukka Wukka.  Yeah.  The Wukka Dukka chocolate cake.  Would you like some Wukka Dukka chocolate cake?  No, I wouldn't.  I'd like that item and your wrists cut.  And then the Wukka Dukka mascot has to come over and wish you a happy birthday. 
[00:58:00]  Happy, happy birthday.  Clap, clap.  Yuck.  You know, we're kind of on to something now.  Because it does go way past the gay drinks.  But you should be able to order the faggy drinks another way.  Like, call it a number.  Just call it a number.  A number eight.  Color code it.  Give me a green.  When you say you want a number eight, that means you don't want the faggy display either.  You want it in a glass that's not see-through and make it look like it's just a vodka. 
[00:58:30]  A lot of it is part of the club's atmosphere.  They don't want to do it.  The uniform.  It's like the Captain Hook uniform.  You know.  The people want to see you deliver that fish in the Captain Hook uniform.  Right.  Have some pride.  But you have faggots with a cake and sparkles on it.  Happy, happy birthday.  Is it?  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy.  Bunch of queers and fat chicks.  This guy went to a gay steakhouse by mistake. 
[00:59:00]  Bill.  What?  There's no such thing as a gay steakhouse.  No, it's not.  They only serve the asshole of the bowl.  Oh.  Lying.  Hello?  Yes, sir.  Yes.  I moved to Atlanta, and these guys told me there was a, and this is before any broke  back time, there's a gay steakhouse in Atlanta called Cow Tippers.  Yeah.  I go in there.  My buddy and I go in early on a Saturday night not knowing anything about it other  than it's supposed to have good steaks.  So I said, hey, we're in Atlanta. 
[00:59:30]  I'll order the peach margarita in the big fish bowl.  So we're sitting there eating steaks.  I start looking around.  Next thing you know, it's like all guys.  And here I am with his steakhouse.  How could there be meat on the bone in the gay steakhouse?  Yeah, nice.  On the bone.  There was a drink at some bar here in New York years ago.  I can't remember the name of it or anything, but it was served in a goldfish bowl, and  it was some blue drink.  It had some blue corso in it. 
[01:00:00]  And the gag, the gimmick was there was a plastic shark, and they filled the shark up with grenadine  and then stuck it in upside down.  So as you're drinking it, the shark slowly bled from the mouth.  There was the grenadine coming out of this blue drink.  And you looked so stupid walking around this big goldfish bowl with a toy shark in it.  No, you looked stupid.  I looked stupid.  So why don't you tell the whole story?  I meant you as, you know. 
[01:00:30]  You.  You being me.  No, E-W-E.  You as in you.  Right.  I did.  I felt very stupid.  But again, very tasty drink.  It looked really ridiculous.  You know what I got?  That was a really weird drink.  Coffee.  Get me a fucking coffee, please.  Perhaps a green tea.  You know, going out to a bar with your friends is about having fun.  And sometimes it involves silly drinks.  Seltzer and lime.  That's a goofy drink.  Seltzer and lime.  That's what I want.  Perhaps a dyed Coke.  Well, we all know the fuzzy navel is. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That's not really a gay drink, though, because it's like.  It's just a known gay drink.  You picture a hot chick.  Fuzzy navel.  No, you don't.  Fuzzy navel.  A lot of the drinks, somebody's saying, is to get the chicks drunk with.  That's what the fag drinks are for.  But they happen to be tasty.  And especially if you're on something like a cruise, it's all about sweet drinks.  Banana things, strawberry daiquiris. 
[01:01:30]  Right.  Things like that.  What?  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Fucking Denny's.  And you know it's not a drink.  It's a food.  Moon's over my hammy.  Now, what is wrong with a funny name like that?  I wouldn't know, because I would point and go, I'd like this, please.  Which one?  The moon?  This.  The moon's over my hammy.  There's hammy.  Right.  And the moon's with the eggs.  Hey, that's my drink.  You drank that?  Yeah.  That's worse than a bikini teeny, my friend.  It certainly is.  What a mo. 
[01:02:00]  That is a faggot-ass drink, man.  It's got an umbrella of a shark.  There's palm trees in it.  Palm trees on it.  It's awful.  Natalie Holloway floating underneath it.  Yeah, do they have that drink yet?  No, they're very sensitive to that in the area.  Are they?  They really don't like the jokes about it or anything.  Yeah.  How many of them are flying around?  A lot of people are just joking all the time on the island?  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, the tourists are always making fun of, you know,  Hey, did you see it?  I found her under a rock.  Trying to make some kind of light of it. 
[01:02:30]  We don't think that's funny here, man.  Not funny.  Even though we did it.  Let's go to Crotch Critter.  Crotch Critter.  Yeah.  Hey, how's it going, y'all?  Hey.  Okay.  I got a faggot-y drink story for you.  I'm down in a bar.  It's a country and western bar down in Louisiana.  It's a huge place.  Not even there anymore.  Anyway, they've got this, their, you know, famous drink.  It's called the leg splitter.  What you do is, you know, it comes in like a glass, it's all green and everything.  Well, I go up, I'm with my girl and a couple other people. 
[01:03:00]  I go up to the bar.  Mind you, it's a country and western bar.  So everybody's, you know, there in their, you know, their cowboy hat, shit kickers,  and, you know, tight-ass blue jeans.  There's only guys at the bar.  I walk up there.  I said, yeah, I'd like a leg splitter.  Everybody looks at me.  As I'm, well, one of the things about buying this drink,  they only let you buy one of them because it's got so much alcohol in them.  They put a big black Sharpie X on your hand.  As I'm walking back to the table, everybody in the bar is, like, looking at me,  looking at the drink, looking at my hand, looking at me, just shaking their head. 
[01:03:30]  I was like, oh, man.  It was unbelievable.  Faggy drank the leg splitter.  Did you split your legs at the end of the night?  That's right.  Well, she did, yeah.  Sure she did.  Or did they only charge Heather Mills half price?  Well, it's like a fucking $10 drink, and, I mean, it looks disgusting.  It looks like they're not a vomit.  Notice every faggy drink story has to start with,  so I'm out with my chick.  Yeah, with my chick. 
[01:04:00]  Did I say chick?  Dude, what happened?  It'll knock you on your goddamn ass.  Jesus Christ, what an anticlimactic piece of crap that was.  Opie and Anthony, XM Satellite Radio.

Your tech replaces the sensor in the performance system, and while he's at it, he replaces the 
[01:07:30]  battery.  Then he says that he has to drive the car to relearn the computer.  What's this?  When a computer system in your car has a problem and a sensor or battery is replaced, a relearn  procedure has to be performed.  This is how the computer is taught to operate within the parameters programmed into it from  the factory once again.  And it's kind of like rebooting your home PC.  To complete this relearn or drive cycle, a certain set of driving instructions must be  followed.  The carmaker may require that the vehicle be driven at 50 miles an hour for so many miles, 
[01:08:00]  and the blower motor and the heating system is turned on to high.  Next, the high beams may have to go on.  Then the car is left to idle for five minutes, and the engine shut off and restarted.  Got a question?  Check our website at americascarshow.com.

[01:08:30]  I'm sure they do.  I enjoy the Grateful Dead show every once in a while.  Horrible.  And then you're like a newbie at the Dead concert and you just want to hear the hits.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, when are they going to play Touch of Grey?  That is their best song.  Dead fans love to hear that, too.  Dead fans hate it. 
[01:09:00]  No, they don't really.  They don't consider it.  It's called Beginner Dead.  Exactly.  There's a whole thing within the Dead community.  If you listen to that stuff, you're Beginner Dead, and they look at you like, oh, that's  kind of cute.  That was like when Charlie Daniels was big in the 70s, and the devil went down to Georgia  that came out.  And if you were a Charlie Daniels fan, that was it.  If anyone liked that song, they were assholes because they didn't appreciate Charlie Daniels  before that.  I like that song because the devil wanted to get a soul. 
[01:09:30]  He couldn't get one.  So he said, let's have a fiddle contest.  I'll fiddle you for it.  Fiddle you.  And we all know how that ended.  That's right.  The devil got his ass kicked.  The devil did.  But that's the only way you can fight the devil.  With a fiddle.  With a fiddle.  With a fiddle.  He wasn't fireproof.  Like the devil's not going to go after losing the fiddle fight.  You know something?  Go fuck it.  I'm the devil.  What, am I going to be a nice guy and go, well, you beat me.  I'm the devil.  So I'm just going to take your soul anyway.  The fiddle is the devil's kryptonite.  Yeah.  Who would have thought?  The devil can't get you through your fiddle. 
[01:10:00]  He's a scary mofo.  But in the middle of the night when the devil comes for a visit, just make sure you've got  a fiddle nearby.  Not a fiddle!  He bows his head because he knew he lost.  He knew that he'd been beat.  By some incest survivor.  And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at who's?  Johnny.  Johnny's feet.  Probably 380 pounds of gold.  And Johnny, what an asshole, he tells the devil, hey, you ever want to try again?  You know, come back.  I'll be here.  I done told you once.  I done told you once. 
[01:10:30]  You son of a gun.  Bitch.  Because it's AM.  Why would you ever give the devil a second chance?  Exactly.  Hey, hey, come on back, mofo.  I'm a tough guy with my fiddle.  I would think it'd be a hell of a fight.  It would have to be in an octagon or something.  They bet the fiddle a goal.  They forget the part after the devil lost.  He took that faggoty fiddle player and just raped him.  And why is the devil behind on getting souls?  Yeah.  What's happening?  He had to go to Georgia?  Exactly.  He wanted a stupid soul. 
[01:11:00]  Oh.  Devil has a hobby.  I also like to croquet.  Crochet.  Guys.  Damn it.  The devil's croqueting.  Might be a sin.  But I'll take your bet.  You're going to regret because I'm the best as everybody else.  Well, that's confidence.  Everyone.  Yeah.  Good tune, though.  And if you win, you get the sign. 
[01:11:30]  You don't like this?  You win, you get the gold.  But if you lose, the devil lose your soul.  Where are you going to sell a gold fiddle?  Yeah.  You know the asshole probably sold it for like 15 bucks at the pawn shop.  Went to the bar.  Got drunk.  Told his story.  No one believed him.  And they punched him in the face.  That's a sucker's bet, by the way.  Part two of this song.  It's a sucker's bet.  Of course it is.  I hate the fact the devil had a band of demons.  Band of demons.  Big red bus pulls up with fire coming out of it.  And who are the band of demons? 
[01:12:00]  The band of demons gets horns.  The band of demons gets horns.  Don't make Satan out of me.  They're not good enough to be Satan himself.  No.  They're in waiting.  They're like the VPs.  And this guy's just got a fiddle.  Right.  And devil, a whole band.  You can hear the bass and everything.  You think when he's playing the fiddle right now, it's blowing the devil's hair back?  Oh, yeah.  Like, oh, no.  He's looking good.  So hard to play the fiddle with cloven hooves.  You have to tape the fiddle thing to it. 
[01:12:30]  Croquet.  Idiot.  Croquet.  He finished Johnny said, well, you're pretty good, old son.  Old son.  He gives it a compliment.  Let me show you how to run.  Bad show.  Oh, well, he's kicking ass.  Do you really think the devil's sitting for this right now?  Yeah, the devil's sitting going well.  I think he's pacing back and forth going, all right.  I got my work cut out for me.  I think the devil says, I don't care if you're better.  I'm going to take your soul because I always get it.  Because you're a human.  Because he always wins. 
[01:13:00]  And who knows what happened after this.  This could have been in the late 30s where the devil got a little cranky at old Johnny  and said, you know what?  That fellow with the short mustache, let's put him in charge for a while.  Yeah, you might have just pissed off the devil.  Now he humbled him.  Oh, boy.  He laid that golden fiddle on the ground.  Why not just hand it to him?  Johnny said, devil, just come on back if you ever want to try again.  I done told you once, you son of a bitch.  Oh, wow.  Hey, Charlie.  The kids are listening, Charlie. 
[01:13:30]  Devil's in the house of the rising sun.  Yeah.  And he gives the devil a little encore.  But he even has a devil song.  Just on that occasion.  The odds of having a devil song ready.  And if you beat the devil, would you really give him an encore?  No.  I think you pick up the golden fiddle and get the fuck out of Dodge.  I think at this point you should be humble, pick up the golden fiddle, and just walk away.  Don't tempt him.  Don't tempt him.  Because, I mean, you've got to regroup when you lose, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And come up with a new strategy. 
[01:14:00]  No fiddle playing.  Now he's going to be like, I'm going to golf.  I'll go to the golf course and bet someone a golden putter.  I'll bet you didn't know it, but I'm a golfer, too.  The hats all turn sideways.  Oh, that kind.  Which way is hell?  He laid the golden tiddlywinks at the ground at little Billy's feet.  He was really desperate.  He's just playing stupid games he can't possibly win.  Hey, devil, idiot, just take the souls. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Why don't you just play to your strengths?  Just play to your strengths like you used to.  I guess you break out the pitchfork and you're fire.  Right, stop poking some people in the ass, you're mine.  Game fucking over.  Game over.  He's playing that fiddle.  Just give him a blast of heat, devil.  Yeah.  I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a macrame or two.  Oh.  I hadn't heard.  Pulls out his golden crochet hook.  Yeah.  And croquet mallet.  Makes a fine doily. 
[01:15:00]  Johnny's like, oh, no.  Oh, boy.  What am I going to do now?  You win a golden doily.  Devil's a douche.  He really is.  He's a...  Song is so bad.  I love that song, though.  I like the music.  No, you don't.  You got a chicken in the bread pan.  You're picking out some dough.  You're picking out dough.  Chicken's going, why the devil's looking?  Why are we going?  What do you want?  Granny's in the middle going, what do you want from me?  No child, no.  I just want a plate of Philly's getting fucking fresh.  Hey, everybody.  This is Travis Tritt, and you're listening to the worst, and I do mean the worst, of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, I know what that is.  We're getting more gifts coming in.  This is from Caroline.  Dear ONA, congratulations on your return to terrestrial radio.  It just wasn't the same without you.  It's been such a great pleasure working with you over the years.  We look forward to continuing to work with you in the future.  We'll all be tuning in to see how you take the show to even greater heights.  And wish you both all the best for continued success with warm regards, your friends and fans, at Caroline's on Broadway.  Let me tell you what kind of a class act Caroline's is. 
[01:16:00]  Bottle of Dom.  The Dom.  That's what they do.  You guys can give Jimmy's his, too.  No cheap champagne.  They give the Dom.  You can give Jimmy his present, too, live on the air.  Where's my present, Steve?  From Caroline's?  Yeah.  Steve went to go find Jimmy's gift from Caroline's.  Oh, good.  Me and Opie each got a bottle of Dom.  It's not like they haven't sold out the room on many, many, many, many occasions.  Well, I don't drink alcohol, so.  Steve, where's the Caroline's gift for Jimmy? 
[01:16:30]  We're all waiting.  I know there must be.  Perhaps it's on its way.  There must have been another gift aside from alcohol because Jimmy doesn't drink.  Right, exactly.  Jimmy doesn't drink.  So there was another Caroline's gift.  What is it?  Maybe they're having trouble getting it up the elevator, Jim.  Oh, is it a piano?  No, maybe they're going to let you emcee.  Ooh.  Is it a...  Well, Ben's in charge of the whole show.  I'm sure maybe Ben has it.  Ben has the skinny on it.  Get Ben in here with my gift.  Get the executive producer of the Opie and Anthony show in here. 
[01:17:00]  Gift time is coming, Bill.  Settle down.  Fat head have the skinny on anything.  All right, we're getting Ben to see where Jimmy's gift is from Caroline's.  Greg Charles from Caroline's sent the gifts up, right?  Yeah, Poe just gave it to me.  There's nothing for you.  Gentlemen.  Huh?  There's nothing for you.  It just said Opie and Anthony.  Are these gifts free?  They're free.  Champagne, it's free.  They put food on Caroline's.  Oh, that has to hurt.  Oh, no, no, that's okay. 
[01:17:30]  I'm sure Greg has something for you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm sure you...  Why bring it up now?  I sure know.  Why?  Let me tell you.  It's not like a good bottle of Dom goes for, you know, $150, something like that.  All right, sure.  So you probably couldn't get anything good for that amount of money anyway.  Probably not.  You better reach for your box.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Bill Burr, you want to explain to Bill Burr?  I'd rather not.  It's embarrassing. 
[01:18:00]  No, it's not.  It's not.  It works.  I think I kind of got it whenever he's feeling a little low.  Oh, okay.  That's right.  Yes.  They're called a box of...  Tender Sentiments.  Tender Sentiments.  And it's a great idea.  It's a little box, and it has tender sentiments written on it, and it's full of little tender  sentiments.  Jimmy gets upset.  He pulls one out.  Shake it up good, Jimmy.  Basically, if nobody loves you or says nice things to you.  Right.  All right, Jimmy.  Calm down.  Jesus.  Here he goes. 
[01:18:30]  All right.  Pull out one and read it.  This will make him feel better.  You are a spark of divine love.  Didn't I have that one already?  You already had that sentiment.  I think you ought to pick a new one until we get a new one.  Yes.  Because the past three we've heard already.  Well, here's what we do.  Rip it up.  Ooh.  All right.  That's great.  Rebroadcast.  Tender Sentiments.  Bill, take it out.  Even the goddamn tender sentiments are in, best of. 
[01:19:00]  All right.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Better rip.  Come on.  Chuck Norris.  Shake it up.  Oh, I know.  In the building.  Here we go.  That looks like a long one.  It is.  You are a beautiful and unique snowflake.  Like snowflakes, which are all different, Jimmy.  You are indeed different and beautiful.  I'm beautiful and unique like a snowflake.  That is indeed a tender sentiment.  And in a weird way, being unique is I am because you two got gifts and I didn't. 
[01:19:30]  And I am a snowflake because I was left out in the cold.  Paul, can you just grab my gift from Caroline's and bring it in?  Might take me a couple of minutes.  Yeah, this is the grand finale of today's show.  Yes, I know you guys are goofing on me.  Like, I understand the humiliation of YSP, a station that I've been friendly with, completely, you know, snubbing me.  But Caroline's, one of my homes here in New York, would never. 
[01:20:00]  I would like to just separate myself from Jimmy and thank Caroline's, who was there during the two years that we were off the air.  Now, normally a comedy club or a friend of the show wants something in return.  The two years we were off the air, we weren't plugging shows.  You know, we didn't have a show.  So, yet, whenever we went down to Caroline's, they treated us like royalty and always have.  And I love the people down there at Caroline's.  You know what? 
[01:20:30]  I didn't want to say this because I thought it would upset Jimmy, but Greg Charles from Caroline's actually sent me a power bar.  Yeah, same.  When he found out that you guys were, you know.  What, it was something.  Yeah.  It was a gesture.  It was something.  It's kind of funny you guys weren't plugging shows for the two years you were off.  But guess who was?  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Jimmy Norton.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I just got word that they're bringing your gift in, Jimmy, from Caroline's.  So, just sit there and wait. 
[01:21:00]  All right.  We're going to go home.  No, we're just, we have to do the interview with the New York Post.  So, you just sit there anxiously waiting for your gift, Jimmy, okay?  Bill Barr, thank you.  The Electric Factory, May 19th in Philly.  Yes.  I just kind of feel like you're saying that because it's not going to be coming.  What happened?  Well, this time I'm going to prove you wrong, bit ruiner.  Old bit blowing bill.  All right.  So, Anthony's going to bed.  Happy birthday, my buddy.  Let me, uh...  Why are you saying goodbye to Anthony? 
[01:21:30]  Let me get a little shot.  No, we have to go, uh...  We're saying goodbye on the air.  You stay.  You're doing the grand finale by yourself.  Ooh.  Uh, just wait for the gift from Caroline's.  We have to, uh, go do the interview with the New York Post.  We have to cancel Hannity and Combs and all the other press for today.  Until Anthony gets better.  Oh.  Come on, Ant.  Bill Barr.  I was just taking my robo-tussin.  All right, guys.  Robo-tussin.  All right.  Looking for me.  Hey, good luck with that Lucky Louie thing, man.  When's my gift coming, Jimmy?  I thought you were going to be a big star.  I just got to wipe out my little cup so it doesn't get sticky. 
[01:22:00]  I never like sticky cup, man.  We have that in common.  And now, let me take my...  Is anybody coming off the elevator?  My little present from...  Where's my gift?  He's on his way, Jimmy.  He's on his way.  I don't need anything else.  I bet it's a special gift because I feel bad that they snubbed me.  It is special.  I heard that he just got buzzed in down at the lobby.  Greg Charles is on his way up.  My gift.  My special gift.  It's on its way, Jimmy.  Just stay there.  Everything will work out in the box. 
[01:22:30]  You have integrity.  Be the best you can be.  Be the best you can be.  I don't think my gift is coming.  I'm going to go now. 
[01:23:00]  Thanks, everyone, for listening.  You are a firm-breasted something.  I am.  Where's my gift?  Ope?  Is Greg here? 
[01:23:30]  People are happy to see you.  People are always happy to see me.  Just not people from YSP.  We're New York comedy clubs.  Can somebody check if maybe there's somebody knocking at the door? 
[01:24:00]  Ope?  Ant?  In a fancy world.  Sorry for all the background noise.  I just been opening a box.  I got another gift.  Where status is everything.  Thanks, Andy, from Seattle.  He, uh, he sent me a used drill.  One man.  I'm an entertainer.  A fancy man.  Do you understand?  There's a fancy entertainer talking.  We'll begin a quest for the ultimate gift. 
[01:24:30]  Fuck you.  The drill diva.  Anybody have anything lighter?  Like maybe a fucking bowling ball with two ledge shoes?  When a regular gift is out of reach.  How about just some pictures of vaginas and some pornography?  Right.  And the gift he gets is unacceptable.  For your deeds, you should have a cordless drill in your house.  Well, come on.  What do you want?  I want a new drill.  Dude, you don't appreciate shit.  I want a cordless fancy drill, boy.  The drill diva took my breath away, says Eric Nagel.  Think about how I feel. 
[01:25:00]  Hoping I have a new cordless gift and seeing that cumbersome cord.  And Ben from Boston raves, bwa-ha-ha-ha, dude, dude.  You want me, me, plugging a cord in like you have to?  You've never seen a spoiled brat hissy fit like this.  You don't deserve to sit there.  Shut your dumb Italian mouth.  I'm talking, boy.  The drill diva, coming soon.  Give me your doc.  Fuck you and fuck your mother.  What do you think of them apples? 
[01:25:30]  The NBA.  He's got nothing but open cord in front of him.  The NBA on ESPN Radio.  Show me what you got, though, mama.  Show me what you got, early.  New hands, man.  What you got, shawty.  Break down the shit.  Show me what you got, baby.  Oh, boy.  Here's something way too bad, way too bad, way too bad, way too bad, way too bad.  The left corner hits a three at the buzzer.  Can you believe that?  This is the NBA on ESPN Radio.  Oh, yeah.  You know what, Pop?

[01:29:30]  Hi, this is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  But it's not bad stuff.  No, these are the parts that make me happy.  I have parts that make Uncle Henry happy.  He was in my room again last night.  Find a happy place.  Has anyone ever, like, done that family tree thing, by the way?  Hmm.  You discover that your family's just filled with, like, alcoholics and stuff.  With nothing?  With nothingness, of course.  You're looking for some kind of greatness, some knight. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  Or something, and it's just nothing.  Just nothing.  The bread cart guy during the plague.  My great-great-great-grandfather was a bootlegger.  Oh, great.  You weren't, like, a pirate in your family or something cool?  Wasn't everyone a bootlegger back at the turn of the century?  You'll get nothing out of it.  What do you do a family tree with?  Huh?  What do you do to get a family tree?  There's all kinds of software.  You go online.  And you find out nothing.  You give them money, and they tell you that, you know, a couple of dagos got on a boat and  came over here. 
[01:30:30]  Right.  It's about the size of it.  Although our own Sam, the intern there, is related to Thomas Jefferson.  Thomas Jefferson, so he says.  So he says he brought in his family tree.  Oh, shit.  Where's mine?  He brought in his family tree.  I can't read it.  Why weren't copies made?  Why don't I have a...  Why don't I have...  Thank you.  I am Sam.  Where is Sam?  This is his family tree?  Yeah.  Thanks, Hawk.  Thomas Jefferson.  What?  He went to get food.  He went to get food, so when... 
[01:31:00]  Miles Standish.  President Thomas Jefferson is our intern Sam's great, great, great, great, great, great first  cousin.  First cousin.  How does it work?  This family tree is really stupid.  It's very confusing.  I can't read it.  There's numbers.  Miles Standish is his great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,  great-grandfather.  Who the hell was Miles Standish?  Miles Standish, the Mayflower. 
[01:31:30]  What?  Came over on the Mayflower.  What?  He was the head muckety-muck on the Mayflower.  All righty.  Are you kidding me?  Wow, this guy's got some blood in him.  Is he Samuel Wood Roberts?  Is that who he is?  Go to the beginning.  Because I see number one.  He's related to William the Conqueror, the King of England?  Stop it.  Where is that?  The light of a 31.  Get out of here.  How could you have this many really cool people in your family?  Right. 
[01:32:00]  This is not really.  I love this.  This guy comes from royalty, and he's getting us our Starbucks coffee today.  William the Conqueror.  He comes from William the Conqueror, and he's, like, conquering Starbucks.  Hey, faggot, conquer that fat-free muffin.  Wait on why with the rest of us.  There's William the Conqueror conquering.  Speaking of miles, walk a few to get me a crispy apple, bitch. 
[01:32:30]  I think we've got to give this Sam guy a little more respect.  Sam.  Jesus.  Samuel.  Yeah.  He's also related to George Harrison.  Where's that?  The George Harrison?  The George Harrison where?  Number 10.  Or some other guy named George Harrison.  Well, I don't know.  It's somewhere between William the Conqueror and Thomas Jefferson.  It's also related to Mary Hart. 
[01:33:00]  I think this is bullshit.  I think he paid money to have this done, and if you pay money, you pay enough money, you'll  get good relatives.  You have to go to tiredofbeingazilch.com.  Right.  Yeah, you know, bring up a good point.  And if you're going to go down this road and you're going to pay people, you've got to  think these people are going to have to give you someone cool.  Yeah.  And your lineage.  Of course.  William the Conqueror, King of England.  That's pretty cool.  Matilda of Germany.  All right.  Henry II, King of England.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:33:30]  Pretty impressive.  Henry III.  Of course, he'd be related to all of them.  They're all related.  Are they?  Yeah.  All right.  I want to get my family tree now.  This is exciting.  Oh, that would be hilarious.  Sir and Baron Andrew Windsor.  Mm.  A Baron.  Huh?  You do.  I know the Pierce's we were related to, they brought ice cream into Jersey City.  That's nobody. 
[01:34:00]  No, that's pretty.  John is calling us out on something here.  John, go ahead.  Hey, Opie, you were dead on calling Bravo Sierra on that guy.  That dicks in the face thing is an old Sam Kinison bit.  Oh, that was?  Yeah.  If you listen to the comedy channel, they play it every now and then.  It is, though, but it is something that people have done.  Shenanigans.  Yeah, it's probably something that people have done.  Hey, you guys got it.  You called him.  Talk to you later.  All right.  Bye.  Let's say hi to Liz.  She needs some advice on a colonoscopy. 
[01:34:30]  Colonoscopy.  Liz, what's up?  Hello?  We lost Liz?  All right.  I'm going to Liz.  Here's Sam.  I am Sam.  There he is.  What's up, Sam?  Hi, everybody.  You're not related to William the Conqueror.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Isn't he right at the top there?  I swear to God, that tree is legit.  How is it legit?  I swear to God.  On a family reunion a few years ago, they put out this book, this big, thick book that  has all these trees laid out by all the divisions. 
[01:35:00]  And my dad, who's now an avid listener, was listening the day that you guys had me on,  talking about bringing some Thomas Jefferson stuff or something.  So that day, he went through the book and actually typed that out and then...  Yeah, but it's confusing.  I know.  That's why I had to make the notes on it because...  Now, I'm looking at this.  Mm-hmm.  Is this...  Because I see mother of, father of, blah, blah, blah in the first column.  Yeah.  But then there's none of that here in the second column where Thomas Jefferson is. 
[01:35:30]  Right.  The second column is...  The second, third, fourth columns are extended generation.  It seems to split after Peter Field Jefferson on both of those and then goes to John Robert  Jefferson.  So is this like maybe one side of the family and then the other side?  This is all my dad's side.  This is all your dad's side.  So Thomas Jefferson II is right there. 
[01:36:00]  This is just the mother and father of.  So Thomas Jefferson II would be the grandfather, making the president of Thomas Jefferson the  first cousin.  The great, great, great, great, great, great first cousin.  I'll say he is.  Roger Williams, founder of Rhode Island, is number 13.  Pretty cool.  And now Miles Standish.  Yep.  That, this looks like a pretty straightforward family tree thing here. 
[01:36:30]  Right.  He would be the grandfather.  The great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great.  So now Miles Standish is the father of Josias Standish.  Is that what I'm...  Yeah, that's what it looks like.  And then that's the father of Mercy Standish, the father of Mary Well...  Wheelock?  Yes.  Wheelock.  They had great names back then.  What if you earned a last name?  I don't know.  Looks at a wheel lock.  Wheel lock?  You just pick them.  And then that, that, that, and then it goes to your father and you. 
[01:37:00]  Right.  Wow.  That's pretty impressive.  That's it.  That's the way to treat...  And I feel bad that you're getting our stuff for us.  Really?  They were looking for black blood in there somewhere.  And my mom was...  Because it's not there, you know, because Thomas Jefferson is a cousin, so it's not...  His blood is not...  So, uh, my mom was trying to go through her family tree, but my mom's family gets a little  shady at points, so they can't exactly trace back...  No way's the one. 
[01:37:30]  There's a lot of shade on her side.  They can't trace it all the way back terribly far.  Well, that's hard.  That's why I'm amazed that you get this far back with a family tree, because I know I could  probably go back to my great-grandfather, and then it would just get lost in some vendetta  somewhere in Sicily.  It gets really shady after those trips to Oakland.  That's very cool, Sam.  But yeah, that's the truth.  Do you have any memorabilia from these people?  No, I mean, there's got to be something somewhere in the family, and... 
[01:38:00]  William the Conqueror's sword or something?  Wouldn't that be cool?  If I can find anything at all, I will absolutely bring it in.  Do you see any paintings of William the Conqueror?  No.  What did he look like?  Was he a big fella?  I have no clue.  My dad handed me that, and he's like, yeah, no.  I would so be researching William the Conqueror.  Died in 1087.  What did he do?  What did he conquer?  Well, Bill, he was better known as Duke of Normandy.  Is that it?  He was William the Bastard. 
[01:38:30]  His rule was stern.  Oh, tell him, Fred.  My rule was stern.  He was faced with many battles.  The most famous was October 14th, 1066.  He led the Normans to defeat the English forces in the celebrated Battle of Hastings.  Wow.  On Christmas Day, he was crowned the King of England in the famed Westminster Abbey.  Wow.  This guy was like the real deal.  Oh, yeah.  An OG.  Are you allowed to just...  Like a real OG. 
[01:39:00]  Are you allowed to just go to the Westminster Abbey and say, hey, I'm related to the dude?  You know, I've never tried, but I've got to assume, yeah, I'll just bring the tree.  That little printout.  That would be, like, pretty good.  You're royalty.  I, um, fast forward 1,000 years.  Who was, who was, uh, this young Sam, the intern?  Oh, this is...  Well, I said here, he would get muffins and coffee for a man with...  How do you do?  I'm Sam.  This is pretty, uh, rude. 
[01:39:30]  The twisted part of William the Conqueror's death.  He died September 9th, 1087, at the age of 60 years old.  Within minutes, the servants stole everything from his residence, including his clothes,  and left his swollen, lifeless body naked on the floor.  That's where you get the black...  There, there you go.  There's your proof, buddy.  An obscure knight named Harloon was the first to discover William's nude body. 
[01:40:00]  At his own expense, he was not a wealthy man.  He arranged for the body to be prepared for the funeral and transported to Cain.  Just before the solemn funeral procession reached the church, the cries of fire were heard.  The mourners were forced to put his coffin down and go fight a fire.  Eventually, they put the fire out, returned to the body, and continued along its way to the church.  The funeral was held on a blisteringly hot day.  As a result, his abscess had swelled and became putrid. 
[01:40:30]  When they tried to fit William's body into a custom-made sarcophagus,  they found out it had swelled so much it wouldn't fit in.  What to do?  They squeezed him in.  They tried to push him to no avail.  Then they pushed his swollen abdominal wall, and William the Conqueror's body burst like a popped balloon.  The pus and putrefaction drenched the king's burial garb.  The stench filled the chapel.  The mourners raced for the door, their hands covering their noses. 
[01:41:00]  Needless to say, they buried him very quickly.  That's Grandpa.  Yeah, that's it.  Instead, what happened was he got thrown a horse through him onto the saddle's iron pommel,  which is that big knob on the front.  Ooh.  And his injuries were internal.  The saddle burst his intestines, and waste matter began to fill and poison his intestines.  Is that what happens?  Yeah, no, I was riding, and the horn of the saddle went up my ass.  Yeah, I swear, I was on a horse. 
[01:41:30]  You go to the doctor with the saddle up your ass.  Pantitis.  Hmm.  Well, very good, Sam.  Couldn't fix that, I guess, back then.  There was no surgery.  He was constantly ridiculed for being a fat man.  Huh.  You're a skinny guy.  Sure am.  That's right.  I'll take after William the Conqueror.  No, sir.  So you think when the servants kind of raided the place, there's that one relative who was slow,  and then there was Kathy with a limp.  Aha!  I see where the tree split.  Wow, that's some family trick. 
[01:42:00]  Hey, this is Dick Cavett, and you are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  You know what's amazing?  You go to Squiz and Ethel, you hear so many young bands that are just doing Kurt Cobain now.  It's unbelievable.  He, he, he.  Because it was all these kids that were like, what, 12 when Kurt killed himself.  They're now, they have their own bands 10 years later, 11, 12 years later.  There's so many bands that sound like Nirvana.  Is it Pearl Jam or Nirvana?  No, Nirvana, all the way.  Yeah, definitely more Nirvana than Pearl Jam. 
[01:42:30]  See, I hear a lot of them that sound like a lot of them.  I hear a lot of them.  Do you really?  I can't even argue.  I used to be the biggest Pearl Jam fan.  Oh, I always hated Eddie Vedder.  I liked the, I liked them when they first came out. 
[01:43:00]  I realized I liked three songs.  I still like listening to their old stuff.  That's it.  I realized I liked three Pearl Jam songs.  Like, wow, I'm a Pearl Jam fan.  And then it's like, no, I just like their three big hits.  Yeah.  That was it.  And now, you know, I'm at a loss to remember them.  I just don't like.  Ever, ever, ever long, ever clear, ever green, ever.  What song is that?  Which one?  What is it there, Hawk?  Oh.  No.  What song are you talking about? 
[01:43:30]  Isn't there an Ever song from Pearl Jam?  Even Flow.  Oh, Even Flow.  Ever.  Ever Flow.  Yeah, this is like huge.  Huge hit.  I hate this song.  Come on, this is good.  Let's listen to Eddie.  Oh yeah. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  There he goes.  Oh!  Where'd he go?  There!  There!  Where'd he go?  Where'd he go?  Scott Gordon? 
[01:44:30]  Where'd he go?  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  uh...  it's not just a like any  or or get  for your first marriage here  group  with a lot of 
[01:45:00]  there  i'll get it for you  Hey, that was fun.  I was harmonizing.  That was great.  That was fun.  We've got to harmonize more often.  Eddie Vedder is a jizzbag.  He should be singing Gypsies, Tramps, and Thieves with that faggoty Cher voice.  Makes me sick.  He always stunk.  I'll be Jerry Cantrell, and you'll be a good old Lane.  Oh, see?  That was another one.  That was one of the best bands ever. 
[01:45:30]  Great.  Who?  The Rooster.  I actually liked Lane Staley's voice better than Kurt Cobain's.  What did he sing?  Lane is great.  Come on now.  What did he sing?  Stop it.  Tell me.  And Alice in Chains getting back together.  Give us a hit.  Without the Lane.  Yeah, without Lane.  Now, he had a very unique singing voice, but it could be compared to that whole time frame.  I think Axl Rose is one of the best rock voices.  Oh, stop it.  Affected shit.  But he has a great voice.  More affected shit that he could never really pull off live. 
[01:46:00]  Update your CDs, sir.  He could not pull off live.  Lane Staley on that MTV Unplugged, when they went through this, magic.  Magic.  I can't hear him singing.  It's quiet.  Say first, you've got to get the booze out of the way.  I'll let the chicken sing this part.  There you go.  There you go.  You almost got it. 
[01:46:30]  See, it's the rooster.  There ain't found a way to tell me yet.  See, this is great shit.  Right, Jimmy? 
[01:47:00]  Obviously, he can sing really well, but it's not my style.  I'll wait until he kicks it in.  Yeah.  He comes in.  Oof.  This is another guy.  Power and Range.  Very underrated, by the way, this band, unfortunately.  They had their success, yes, and they had their hits, but they were overshadowed by a bunch  of the other bands that came out at the time.  Listen to that shit.  Yes. 
[01:47:30]  Somewhere.  Would you?  Well, they come to snuff the gum.  Dream gum.  Would you?  Yeah.  Yeah, here come the rooster.  Some of the best parmen in here in the 90s.  Listen to this, right here.  Make you want to kill somebody, this music.  I love it. 
[01:48:00]  That's a great voice right there.  All right.  Yeah.  Great stuff.  I wish I liked alternative rock better.  He's actually good.  I just don't.  I'll give you a list of Alice in Chains songs you should at least check out before you decide  they suck.  Or not suck, or before you decide you're not at home.  Some bands I think suck, and some bands I know are good.  His voice grows on you, and I can't get enough of Alice in Chains.  I like it, except for this part.  Someone's suggesting a Jane Gum karaoke night, where we just do songs of artists that sound 
[01:48:30]  like Jane Gump.  And you have to spin and drop business cards.  Great big fat person.  The best question ever asked, by the way.  I don't know if I've ever pointed that out.  It's the best question ever asked anywhere.  Wait a minute.  Was she a great big fat person?  Everybody wants to ask that question at least twice a day.  Of course.  The best description you can give.  Why not use it?  You got a call from a girl.  Wait a minute.  Was she a great big fat person?  Yes.  Someone has lost all respect for little Jimmy Norton.  John in Long Beach. 
[01:49:00]  Hey, Jimmy.  Long Beach, California?  You know how Long Beach is around.  Okay.  Hey, Jimmy.  You put Pearl Jam up against Ozzy any day, Pearl Jam wins.  Yeah, do they?  Yeah.  There it was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why do you got me?  I'm not too sure what to say.  I mean, you know, yeah, they're just a hot band for, what, since 1968?  Pearl Jam, I mean.  Well, Pearl Jam's still doing it.  Yeah, they're terrific.  They are. 
[01:49:30]  They're still doing it.  I would rather listen to Pearl Jam than Ozzy.  I'm not trying to get under your skin.  Dude, that's fine.  There are too many.  Can't find a better man.  Can't find a better man.  That song, when it came on, click, click.  And that other one, the old lady in a fucking restaurant in a car with a fucking, the title  was eight feet long.  Elderly woman behind the counter in a small town.  Oh, is that a horrid, presumptuous asshole with that fucking title. 
[01:50:00]  I could give you 50 Sabbath beats or 50 tempos of smash.  Give me elderly woman behind the counter in a small town, please.  Anything Pearl Jam did.  Derek, hit it.  E-Rock, hit it.  E-Rock, hit it.  Somebody.  I seem to recognize her face.  Yeah, this is great.  It's a front day for me there.  I can't seem to place it.  Can I find the candle of the light? 
[01:50:30]  Droning.  Just a, just a rap.  Hompous something.  Shut up.  The best part of the song's coming.  Why, the end?  It just sucks.  When he goes, my God, it's been so long.  Come on, baby.  All this changes take, hey, I wish I'd seen the place, but no one's ever taking me hearts and thoughts. 
[01:51:00]  Could you help me with this thing?  Put it in the van.  There's a moth flying around in my dark room.  He just wants to scream hell out.  Here it comes.  I swear I recognize Frederica Bimmel's face.  All cut diamonds in her back.  And we're down because she looks near me. 
[01:51:30]  Here it is.  Here it is.  No.  Damn it.  I haven't heard the song in one time.  For I'm not my boy.  Put a fucking lotion in the basket.  Oh, eight fucking minutes into the song.  There he comes.  There he comes.  Come on.  Come on, Eddie.  There he comes.  Perhaps that's what no one wants to say. 
[01:52:00]  You gotta go to the chorus.  I just wanna scream.  It's horrible.  My God, it's been so long.  Never dreamed you'd return.  But now here you are.  And here I am.  Hearts and thoughts, they fade. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, this just blows Sabbath away.  This is great.  This is the most boring fucking song.  You have a national acrobat in this stupid computer?  And then he's gotta do this 800 times.  I turn the tape.  Oh, he's awful.  800 times.  Sounds like an American Indian folk singer.  It's a boring song.  She's singing this around a fire, trying to get range for the planes.  It stinks.  Are we doing this to get listeners playing songs and singing along with them? 
[01:53:00]  Because David Lee Roth gave it a whirl.  And I don't think that worked for him, so.  All right, let's go to Tom in Ohio.  Tom.  Morning, fellas.  How you doing?  All right.  We're gonna try to move on from this.  I had a better song.  All right.  No, you don't.  I did so.  No, you don't.  That idiot made a comparison.  I didn't like it.  Let's go, Tom.  Hey, I just wanted to agree with you.  Alice in Chains, one of the best bands ever.  I'd say Jar of Flies is one of the best albums I've ever heard in my life.  I can't hear enough of Alice in Chains.  I think at this point in my life, I like Alice in Chains more than Nirvana. 
[01:53:30]  One of the best bands out of the era.  I also like Soundgarden.  And just how he died.  No one cared because he just shut off everybody.  Yeah.  And they found him like three weeks later.  Crazy.  Dude, Pearl Jam.  Can you help me put this in my van? 
[01:54:00]  Would you?  With my broken arm, I don't think I can.  I have been guilty of murdering girls that are fat.  You're on my list now.  What do you think about that? 
[01:54:30]  You're down in a hole.  Yeah.  And I'm in control.  You're down in a hole.  Cause I hate my poor.  I like to tuck.  I like to tuck in my junk. 
[01:55:00]  Frederica.  Great big fat person.  You're down in a hole.  And it's all because you aren't thin.  Now you're forced to put the lotion on your skin.  We just a man. 
[01:55:30]  And it was that just a knock at the door.  I smell a cunt.  It must be that old FBI whore.  You're down in a hole.  You're down in a hole.  Yeah.  And I'm in control.  You're down in a hole. 
[01:56:00]  Cause I hate my poor.  I like to tuck.  I like to tuck in my junk.  Young.  Young.  XM.  XM.  202.  The O.P.  and Anthony Show.  XM.  And Christmas music.  To make the season bright.  From hits on holiday.  To holiday traditions.

[02:00:30]  Opie and Anthony show.  He's up on the gay shit.  Oh, Jim.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  So what happened with the hand job last night?  I was just a massage that went awry.  I don't know.  What do you think you're coming over for at that hour?  Uh-oh.  She didn't know.  Awful little mousy Canadian.  But it seems like you would be a pro by now where you would know which ladies are going to give you the old happy ending at 3 in the morning. 
[02:01:00]  3 in the morning.  She comes to your house.  Is she doing like the regular massage?  Yeah, kind of.  Where are you laying?  The bed?  Yeah.  So you're in your bedroom.  Naked.  Naked.  Naked.  You're completely naked.  My stupid arm stretched out.  Just nude on my stomach.  Was she even trying to cover your ass up with anything?  Oh, no.  All right.  Her fingers brushed my balls a couple times.  Like as she was doing your inner thigh?  And she had a... 
[02:01:30]  So she knew what was going on.  And then how does it end where she goes, no, I don't do that?  You see when they start looking at the clock towards the end of the hour, you're like, uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  So you start aiming your penis at them, like just grabbing it and kind of pointing it in the general direction that they're sitting at.  Like an accusing finger.  Was she on your back?  Was she...  Were you on your back?  By that point, I was, yeah.  Yeah.  When the minutes are ticking away, I'm sure Jimmy just flips right over.  You have no idea.  I'm fucking...  I'm Frank Flip. 
[02:02:00]  And, uh, of course, fully aroused.  No.  No?  For what?  She was doing nothing.  Well, I would think to let her know.  No, she...  Give her the old, hey, I'd take care of this issue.  No, a little dumb Adrian fucking from Rocky face.  Stupid Talia Shire mousy face.  She'd be having a miscarriage in a fucking pet food store.  So she, uh, did she go near it?  Did she, like, brush, uh, that when you were on your back? 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, she was just weird, man.  She brushed it.  And then what...  How does it end?  What do you say to her?  Like, you just start stroking it and offering her more money.  Oh, you did?  Did I?  Yeah.  So, so you start stroking it and then you go, what do you need?  Like, 20 more bucks?  What?  I'm like...  What's the line?  I don't know.  Sometimes you don't know what them...  Yeah?  I normally don't.  I'm like, look, I know the game.  You do.  Wow.  I've been here before.  That's scary right there.  Why?  That's scary to me.  If a girl's in there doing that and then you go, look, no, I know. 
[02:03:00]  No, no, no, no, no.  This is after she was dressed and stuff.  I mean, I'm dressed when she's on her jacket and still on.  She's like, I normally don't.  I'm like, look, I've done it enough.  I understand.  You do.  Once in a while you'll do it when you're in the mood.  I know.  Oh, wait a minute.  You weren't her type?  Um, well, neither apparently was...  Not what you were insinuating?  Neither was Ben Franklin.  Oh, God.  So you had to send her on a wet, you paid her?  Wait, so was it awkward for an hour? 
[02:03:30]  Because you...  This is towards the end.  You invited her over for a massage.  Was it a legit massage?  Like she was...  Yeah, so it was mediocre.  Oh.  And then I wound up giving her extra.  She wound up doing it.  Oh, she did?  With her jacket on, standing there.  Oh, my God.  How...  It was awful.  What a horrid scene this is.  I'm on my back at the end of the bed, just jerking it and talking to her.  And I already paid her.  I mean, I'm not menacing.  Can I ask you a question?  Sure.  How much more did you have to pay for her to sit there and watch you jerk it? 
[02:04:00]  And then she kind of helped while she had her jacket on.  With her tits off.  She took her tits off.  Her tits off.  Her tits off, yeah.  Oh, she did?  Yeah.  Out of her jacket?  No, she opened the jacket later.  Oh, okay.  How much extra?  I don't know.  A hundred.  So was there a negotiation that went back and forth?  Like, you know, I'll give you a look.  I'll give you 25 if you just finish it.  And she goes, no.  And then what did you say then?  Like, what would it take to make you happy?  What would it take?  And she said... 
[02:04:30]  So she went like that.  I'm like, all right, there's a price.  What was your next offer?  75.  75?  And she still went no?  She's like, what are you going to do to my tits?  What are you going to do?  Cut them off if you don't say yes, you idiot.  It's really annoying.  And then you had to say, all right, look, I'll give you a hundred.  That's it, yeah.  That's it.  And then how long did it take her to say yes?  Did she go again or just go?  She just kind of did it. 
[02:05:00]  I was, what a rot I had.  She reached over.  At that point, it wouldn't have mattered who was standing there.  As long as there was a human hand on it.  Why?  You were just so worked up.  How could you not be?  You're jerking off with a strange Canadian looking at you.  How could you not be turned on?  I don't know.  That seems so awkward.  It was.  And out of place.  She doesn't want to do this.  Was there small talk going on?  Light.  Like what?  What were you talking about?  Just like, you know, what do you think at this hour? 
[02:05:30]  What are you thinking?  Like, I wasn't rude or vicious.  I mean, she could laugh and she knew it.  I'm not very threatening.  She's like, well, I said legitimate.  I'm like, it's two in the morning you came.  Yeah.  And I'm naked.  You brushed my balls.  She kind of laughed.  I'm like, I didn't mean to.  I'm like, yes, you did.  I didn't mean to.  You did mean to.  I know what the finger brushing the balls means.  That's the wink.  The wink of the massage girl.  So now, I assume. 
[02:06:00]  This is a documentary waiting to happen, man.  This is a reality show waiting to happen.  I was so annoyed.  Because your career is going so well.  And you're sitting there, two in the morning.  And this zero shows up.  A zero.  And she's not going to do what you expect her to do.  You know who?  She looked like Frenchie from Grease.  Oh, my God.  Massage school dropout.  Fucking.  So now, I assume she finishes you off.  Yeah. 
[02:06:30]  How long after that does she leave?  I was wiping them up.  Handed her the bill.  And she fucking amscrated.  And I smirked at her.  She left.  Gotcha.  Oh, yeah.  You got her.  She did, though.  She actually was very happy to leave with no extra money.  Yeah.  She would have left with no extra money.  So it was a success for you?  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  Beat it.  Did she wash up?  Oh, yeah.  But you know what?  The thing is, she sold me one car instead of selling me many cars in the future. 
[02:07:00]  Ah, okay.  See?  See?  What a dope.  She's never getting a call back.  Jimmy, you sound really tired today, too.  How could you not be up haggling?  It was like a fucking, it was like a Turkish flea market.  But I don't understand.  Don't you have, like, regulars that'll come over and do what you want?  What fun is that?  Who wants sex?  Who wants sex?  No, I'm talking about when you...  You want a little game like this?  I'm talking about when you're going down the massage route.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You could probably, but some of them, you'd think, yeah, done with that, done with that. 
[02:07:30]  You want to just move on?  It's fun.  Wow.  I was very frustrated.  But they couldn't do a documentary.  I don't want to sign off on it.  Yeah, let's go to George in Chicago.  George!  Hey, I know what Jimmy said to the Canadian when he flipped over.  He pointed to his cock and said, what are we going to do about this, eh?  Eh?  Eh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Bob in Jersey.  Hey, Bob.  Hey, what's up?  $100 for a handjob?  Dude, I...  You could get blown for $40 in Germany.  I know, I know.  In Germany. 
[02:08:00]  I know.  Here's a rule of thumb.  Um, never negotiate with your cock out.  What was she, a Craigslist whore?  They say never go food shopping hungry.  That's exactly what it is.  That's exactly what you did.  Yeah.  Was she a Craigslist?  Not only did I go food shopping hungry, but I went to the farm where they named the prices.  You know, and he knew I wanted those eggs.  Yeah, she knew absolutely you weren't going to let her leave without her doing what you wanted her to do.  Did she know who you were? 
[02:08:30]  No, I wouldn't do it.  I wouldn't have to tell her.  Hey, do you watch Comedy Central?  She's crooked.  Jacket.  She's just jacket.  Yeah, any of these ladies recognize you when they show up?  Yeah, I believe you.  There's one I've called.  She goes, oh, you're the one with the pictures on the wall when I used to live in 43rd Street.  You're the one with the funny pictures of you and famous people on the wall.  That's right.  That's me.  That's what you're known for.  All right.  Let's say hi to Matt in New York.  Hey, Matt, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I want to ask Jimmy, what's the exact protocol to initiate the transaction? 
[02:09:00]  Because I went about a month ago, I went to a massage parlor, and it was, you know, it was the upper level of a storefront.  So it probably wasn't a legit place.  I get there, I start getting the massage, and then the girl flips me over, and she goes, okay, what do you want?  And I said, you know, do everything.  And she goes, she looked at me, everything?  I said, yeah, do everything.  She goes, oh, no, that's illegal.  I felt like such a tool, and I had to slink my way out of the place.  Because you are a tool.  Whenever they say, no, that's illegal, that means that they want to know that you're not a cop. 
[02:09:30]  Right.  I mean, I came in, I was, you know, I wasn't wearing anything that was, I wasn't wearing plain clothes.  It was actually coming in scrubs and stuff.  I remember one time, I went to this place in Los Angeles a long time ago, and the girl, the first night, fucking, I went to see her, and she was, I'm on my back on the table, and my leg is propped up.  But it was like a $70 massage, $60 massage, actually.  And she had, like, she has my right leg.  Picture yourself on your back, um, with your right leg bent and out to the right, and she's holding it and kind of doing this weird pressure. 
[02:10:00]  She didn't want to do anything.  I finally got her to jerk me off.  Like, she actually was like, all right.  Um, they all seem like, ugh, okay.  She did, but she was sexy.  She wouldn't let me touch her ass or anything.  I come back to see her again because she turned me on.  She's fucking massaging me.  She starts leaning down.  The next thing you know, full, right down on it.  Wow.  Un-fucking, she just started blowing me.  How did that happen?  Who knows?  God's intervention. 
[02:10:30]  It was so unexpected.  She was just blowing me.  She had a few drinks in her.  Ah.  I think.  I went up banging her.  Um, fucking standing behind the massage table.  Wow, look at you.  A long time.  After I came, she was just laying on the couch for a half hour, zoned out and drunk, playing  with herself.  She didn't want me to go.  It was really bizarre.  Yes.  You never know.  It's a far cry from, all right, don't touch my ass.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Theo in South Dakota.  Theo. 
[02:11:00]  What's up, guys?  Hey, I just love listening to you guys.  Fucking got XM about three months ago.  Got to tell you guys the shit.  Used to love Howard, but totally fucking hate that fucker now.  Um, but, uh, I just wanted to mention, because Jimmy was talking about that, obviously that  blow job, or that hand job for a hundred bucks.  I was in, uh, fucking Detroit.  Had some, uh, hoover come over.  Fucking, thought I was definitely going to get something, pay 300 bills, only to have her  fucking sit on the bed naked with her fucking C-section scarf, giving me a fucking blow, 
[02:11:30]  or a hand job.  Yeah, it's the worst.  Horrible.  Fucking horrible.  All right.  That's all.  Thanks, guys.  Appreciate it.  I'm out.  All right.  I had one, um, I forgot my story when he called shit.  I don't know, a hand job.  All right.  Keep thinking.  Let's go to Ass F in Jersey.  Ass F.  Hey, uh, serious question for Jimmy.  Hey, Jimmy, how close did you ever come to actually pulling the trigger?  I've been listening to you for a while.  Oh, myself?  Yeah. 
[02:12:00]  On yourself.  Relatively close.  Or toe on the trigger, whatever.  Yeah, relatively close.  I mean, what's relatively close?  Like, actually done, or pills, or?  I don't know, sir.  Just say relatively close.  All right.  Well, I suggest you try it tonight.  Please.  All right.  I was in LA, and I went for a massage, and she was legit.  And I knew she was legit, because she made you drape.  And, uh.  What?  They made you wear, they put draping over you.  Oh, okay.  Drape. 
[02:12:30]  And when you walked through the bathroom, there was a sign.  Look at all these code words.  Drape.  They made you drape.  Draping.  Like, yeah, it's a legit one.  Yeah, draping.  We all know about draping.  Can I have a draping?  Sure.  When you walk in, I walked in the bathroom, and there was a thing over the toilet, and  it said, may you be in heaven a half hour before the devil knows you're dead.  And I'm like, I looked at my dick and went, it's not going to happen, fella.  And, um, when I came out, I got undressed.  And, uh, she's like, you have to get under the towel.  And I'm like, I'm like, oh, you're really strict with that. 
[02:13:00]  She goes, yes, absolutely.  Oh, you just, no.  She was fucking, not fucking around.  Wow.  So she gave a good massage.  Yeah, then you just, you probably just write it off like, okay, I'm going to enjoy a good  massage.  Absolutely.  A deep tissue massage.  The first massage I went for yesterday around 6 p.m. was actually a very good, uh, regular  massage?  Yes.  It did not end.  How many massages did you get yesterday?  Yeah, two.  Two.  I'm fucking out of control.  I just want love. 
[02:13:30]  I just got a second massage.  You just need a girl to be touching you and talking to you.  Wait, we were talking about hoarding yesterday, and you wanted to collect, uh, hugs and something  else.  You wanted to collect little, uh.  Yeah, I'll put it in a bottle.  What was it again?  I don't remember, but I know I'd like, come on, help me out.  I don't remember.  Was it tender moments?  Tender sentiments.  Oh, it's tender sentiments.  Tender sentiments.  Sounds like you need some of those hugs you've been collecting.  It ended badly the first one, too.  It was a really bad day yesterday.  What?  What happened?  It's like fishing with Jimmy.  I didn't catch anything. 
[02:14:00]  Ah, nothing.  Brought my bait.  Well, not for that reason.  No, I kind of figured this one was really like a strict masseuse, because the name of the  company was, it was like a company.  So, uh, I was supposed to be there at five, but I was happy.  We don't jerk you off massage.  Exactly.  Yeah, exactly.  Do-it-yourself, Inc.  It was, uh...  Maybe you shouldn't name the company for all the other guys out there, because it's a  legit place.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Well, here's what happened.  I think it would be bad if the guys are calling up, like, there's a million guys calling up  going, hey, I know the best place. 
[02:14:30]  Like, this dope.  Cisco in Jersey.  Cisco.  Yo, how you doing, Jimmy?  Hey.  Hey.  Listen, if you want a real good massage, I know where the places to go in Jersey.  It's in Jersey, but they're fantastic.  The girls are Brazilian.  They'll give you a good massage, and when you roll over, they'll do anything you want,  even Greek if you want it.  Oh, cool.  I like a girl who speaks Greek.  Oh, they speak it and they do it, my man.  But it's fantastic.  If you want, uh, you know, I'll hold on.  I'll give you a few numbers that you can go to, and they'll take care of you. 
[02:15:00]  And just mention my name.  You'll get in the door.  You don't have to worry about paying the desk.  Just mention my name, and you tip the girl.  Okay, thanks.  Yeah, just be on hold.  There you go.  They got to blow up their spot.  Bad rep the Greeks got.  Yeah, that's what they get.  Fucking, uh.  So anyway, 6 o'clock.  I am having blinds installed.  My shoulder shades came.  Congrats.  Thank you.  And, um, I knew I was running late.  I had a 5 o'clock appointment.  So I called her, like, this late.  I'm not 6, it was 5.  I called her, like, 4 or 15, like, I'm going to be late.  Because she knew I was doing that. 
[02:15:30]  I just booked it, like, 1 in the afternoon.  Like, I'm having this stuff installed.  So I was late.  And I told her I called her three times.  Just because I'm very courteous like that.  And I get there, and, um, I know she's legitimate, and I walk in.  Which is fine.  I could care.  I just, I want her to know.  Now, how do you know?  The atmosphere, the setting.  It's like an office.  You know what I mean?  You just kind of knew.  This is kind of good for the people out there, so they know when they walk into a massage  place, uh, not to say, hey, could you stick a thumb up my ass and play with my balls.  Yeah, no, I wouldn't have done that there. 
[02:16:00]  And I didn't really care about that at that point.  I actually wanted a massage.  I'm like, yeah, let me get a real.  Once in a while, you want a real massage to relax.  Like, someone who, there's nothing better than when your spine is cracked and little  knuckles on you.  It feels good.  Sure.  So, I walk in, and I get it, and I'm on my stomach, and she was like, well, do you want  to do an hour and a half since we started 25 minutes late?  And I'm like, nah, I would rather just do, um, the whole hour, because I had to work at  Villa.  And, uh, I had to wear the towel the whole time.  You know, I was joking about how I hated the towel, but she was, I knew it was not going 
[02:16:30]  off.  It's not happening.  It was fine.  It was not, it was a decent massage.  It's a joke.  I was joking about not liking the towel.  I was kidding!  I was kidding!  Alvina!  So, um, all of a sudden, this massage seemed a little short.  She stopped at 40 minutes, because that was technically the end of when the hour would  have started, had I been on time.  Whoa!  That ain't good.  And I'm like, but I called you, I did on a credit card, too.  Like, you had to hold your point on a credit card.  Um, it's another sign that that's a legit place.  Yeah.  You know. 
[02:17:00]  Um, and she's like, well, you know, we have a policy.  I'm like, you're the, you're the proprietor.  It's your place.  And that was really awkward.  And she's like, well, you know, I'm like, this is unprecedented.  Like, you would charge me when I called you.  You knew it was-  I'm outraged.  This is unprecedented.  It was like the McCarthy hearings.  You've never heard language like that.  Bye!  I am outraged.  You're out of order, whore!  I was so irritated.  And then she was like, well, I guess I'll just charge you for 45 minutes. 
[02:17:30]  Um, and I knew she was afraid I was going to refuse the charges on the card.  I'm like, no, just keep the money.  Keep it.  How much was it?  A hundred bucks.  Regular hour-long massage.  Um, which is even expensive, actually.  But I mean, again, for someone that does, like, holistic, like, counseling and food,  they do all that, like, health counseling.  Hippie shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I mean, it's like, it's a legit business.  So I was so irritated.  All I'm thinking of is just killing her on the earth today.  I'm like, oh, your phone is going to ring.  Stupid. 
[02:18:00]  I've never had that happen.  Yeah.  And I emailed her.  I've never emailed somebody about how annoyed I was.  I'm like, you know, you're in the, why would you do that?  Uh-huh.  And she was very apologetic.  So I don't know if I'm going to give the name of the place out.  Maybe I will next week.  But that's why you had to get the other massage yesterday.  Yeah.  Well, no, I kind of knew that one wasn't going to be anything other than a massage.  Because something was missing.  Something was missing, right.  It was just a bad.  It was either that or write another post-it.  Do something.  Just another post-it.  Post-it guide from yesterday.  Yes, they referenced me again. 
[02:18:30]  Write it.  So we referenced you.  Gotta write it.  Post-it guide from yesterday.  That was my life.  That was terrific.  Wow, you've got a hell of a thing going on.  Yes, it's called loneliness.  It takes up a lot of time.  It's all-consuming.  Is it ever fun, Jimmy?  Is it ever fun?  Yes.  Okay.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Because you're making a lot of people sad.  Even when it's over.  I'm just tired.  When it's over.  I know.  I got to tell you, I thought I was really tired today.  Because there's things going on.  I'm just exhausted. 
[02:19:00]  And so I didn't get a good night's sleep.  And after hearing, what was the guy's name?  Tom?  Yeah.  The intern?  Yeah.  And then Jimmy has a mellow delivery today.  I feel like I'm wide awake.  Yeah, I was really sleepy.  Bundle of energy.  Let's say hi to Josh in O-Town.  Bring it on, brother.  O-Town.  Tough guy from O-Town.  That's the theme of today's show.  So bring it on, brother.  I was in North Carolina.  And they had these places called adult relaxation places. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  Whatever.  And a buddy of mine was like, hey, let's go in here and get a massage.  So I went in there.  And he goes in the other room.  And I'm just like hanging.  And all of a sudden, this lady comes out and says, OK, you're next.  I figured she was like the owner of the place.  She was like 80 years old.  I go in the back room.  And she's the one giving me a massage.  This like 80-year-old woman.  And she starts doing stuff.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Josh.  Was she really 80?  Dude, she was very old.  And I'm talking about like extremely old.  If she was 67, she would fucking rode hard and put away wet. 
[02:20:00]  I'll tell you what.  All right.  Anyways, I go ahead.  And she starts giving me a massage or whatever.  And she goes, so you want to turn over?  I'm like petrified.  Not because it's not what she planned on doing in the first place.  This lady was like, I mean.  I just had the visual in my head.  Dude, it was way worse than what she did.  Believe me.  So I want to hang on with it.  Can you imagine, though?  Do you want to turn over?  I'm thinking about that. 
[02:20:30]  I'm thinking she's going to like try to gum me or something.  I'll say no.  Do I have a choice?  For me to get a good massage, a good like legit one, it's got to be with a woman who's unattractive, like heavyset.  Not fat, but kind of like a – I got one in D.C., a Brazilian lady who was kind of like butchy.  Really?  Yeah, she was in her 40s because it was like a – it was a woman's hand. 
[02:21:00]  I don't want a guy's hand.  And it was legitimate.  You mean I'm a little strong?  Well, no, no.  I just wasn't attracted to her.  This chick had like loose skin.  It was like foul.  Wait, Josh.  So finish up with you and then we got to get back to Jimmy.  That's cool.  So you turned over?  Yeah, I turned over.  I let her go at it.  Dude, I went to an old lady one time.  Her name in the – all you didn't say was in the paper.  It wasn't her real name.  It was Miss Park.  And she did like some naughty –  Hey, I'll let you guys go, man. 
[02:21:30]  English teacher.  Dude, she was awful.  This was years ago.  I show up at her place.  She's probably 50 years old wearing glasses.  She did some like –  Bifocals?  Yeah, pretty much.  And it was the fucking worst.  I get my pants off and she was like trying to be dominating and sexy,  but I just wanted to kick her in the face.  Because she gave my bottom a swat and she goes, ooh.  Like she was like looking at my penis, which was – it looked like fucking –  It looked like it had just come out of ice water.  You've never seen a softer object. 
[02:22:00]  And she looks at it.  She goes, ooh, look at you, naughty boy.  Aw.  She gives my ass a swat with her 50-year-old hand.  That was so –  I guess the last I have a rod, is that your line?  And she said something about Ronald Reagan.  Really?  Yeah, we were talking about Reagan.  I don't remember.  It was so awful.  And I'm on my stomach.  Probably a date she had with him.  Jesus.  And she put baby oil on me, which is the worst massage stuff. 
[02:22:30]  And she was – I think Jack could be a little and I actually stopped her.  I'm like, I can't do this.  I had to go see my girlfriend.  Just get out of here.  Was there any action going on?  Down below?  My dick was actually angry at me for attempting to wake it up.  That is really funny.  Let's say hi to David in Florida.  David.  Jimmy, don't feel so bad, man.  At least you got something out of it.  I had the bitch walk out on me after five minutes.  She took my money.  Actually, first, it doesn't look good when she shows up in a brown leisure suit. 
[02:23:00]  Wow.  Was she hot?  And then she just comes in, takes the money, gets on the phone and starts yabbling for five minutes.  Looking at my computer screen here because there was some porn on it.  And then she starts going out and she says, hey, I've got to give the dude my money.  And I said – and I've been through it before, unfortunately.  It's like I've got to go out.  You know, I've got to go out with you.  And I start walking out with her because I knew what she was trying to do.  And I get out there and she starts going, well, you have adult material on your computer and we don't do that kind of thing. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, boy.  And she took the money, right?  I looked at her and I went, you're ripping me off, right?  And I just turned and walked away.  Yeah, I am.  Yeah, yeah.  If I ever wanted to get on Whack Bag and put the name of this company up, I wanted to.  So freaking bad, man.  Go in a pal talk and do it.  Why not?  They would love to tease those people.  You absolutely should.  Go on Craigslist and post it.  If it's a run and grab, go to Craigslist and post it.  You know, after your stool thing, you know, with your stools, I was thinking we should have some just top secret, way underground websites. 
[02:24:00]  It's like that movie, that old movie where they took care of justice.  Michael Douglas.  The Chamber?  The Chamber.  No, no.  Was it The Chamber?  Yeah, it was The Chamber.  No, The Star something.  Star Chamber.  Oh, Star Chamber.  Okay.  Star Chamber.  Star Chamber.  I don't know if the movie holds up, but that was a terrific flick back in its day.  How Holbrook was a judge?  Yeah, yeah.  And we should have these just-  Tell it to call you Billy.  We should have these way underground websites where we take care of these businesses that are just doing our listeners wrong, man. 
[02:24:30]  You have to, in a weird way, when it comes to massage, like this is where I wish Keith was not such a lazy shitbag and came in,  because he's a complete filthbag and has massage stories where he's actually almost had fights in place.  Keith Robinson?  He's a fucking maniac.  Keith Robinson, a guy that we know would do great radio for us, and for some reason we just can't get him in here.  He loves, he loves, he's just, he's fucking lazy.  He's lazy.  Is he shiftless, too?  Well, yeah.  You know, comes with the- 
[02:25:00]  Lazy.  Yeah, comes with the hairdo.  Well, he's, he has the best massage stories where he's, he, he, one time he said this chick showed up,  this really skinny, crack whore chick, and he wouldn't pay her, because he won't pay her.  He really won't pay.  And she's like, well, I'm going to go out and get my driver.  He's like, well, bitch, go get it.  And then the driver called up and goes, I'm going to have to come up there, and Keith's  like, well, that motherfucker, come up and get your money.  You know, and the fucking guy, of course, didn't come up, because Keith is a psychopath.  He really is.  And the guy could sense that this is a major problem, and she was ugly.  But whereas me, I would have been like, yeah, go ahead, because you don't want to get maced. 
[02:25:30]  Another friend of mine, whose name I can't mention, had a gun pulled.  I mean, you did, there were once in a while, you came on to a serious, once in a while,  you got to say-  Gee, who would think?  Dealing with the underworld.  It's the cost of doing business.  It's like being involved in gambling.  There's times where you're just going to lose, and it's like, fucking, it sucks, and you  know you shouldn't, but-  What was the worst thing that happened to you with these massages?  Massages.  Massages.  Jesus.  One time, a hooker grabbed my key-  Oh, that's different.  I grabbed my keys in my car, threatened to throw them out the thing. 
[02:26:00]  I had a hooker snatch my glasses off years ago.  Your glasses.  Why?  You don't, you don't-  You used to wear really bad glasses.  Years ago.  You don't, you don't want to know.  Many years ago.  Why did you snatch them off?  Well, it was kind of a she.  But it was-  How old were you?  I'm 37, 38, 36, maybe.  I was probably early 20s, 22, and I just discovered, fucking, that tranny's hung out. 
[02:26:30]  I really was new to me, and I was fucking, kind of fucking with them.  Like, I would never stop.  I would just kind of, like, stop, and I didn't realize that there's a wall you have.  Like, like, my window was always open.  I didn't think anyone would ever reach into the car.  Uh-huh.  And I would just kind of ride around and, like, ask them questions and drive away.  I was just the most annoying guy, and it was fun.  Um, and my buddy, comic buddy, showed me where they were.  And I stop on time, I'm at the stop sign, and I fucking, the one who I asked a bunch  of questions to just walks over and snatches my glasses off my face and goes, for wasting 
[02:27:00]  my time, and walks away with them.  And I'm fucking, this is where I live with my parents.  I'm in-  You gotta drive home.  Dude, I couldn't see.  I'm in fucking-  You idiot.  I'm in a stop sign.  There's cars beeping at me.  There's fucking prostitutes all over.  I can't see.  A hooker took my glasses and my shoes.  I couldn't see, literally, I can't see 30 feet in front of me.  And I'm like, oh my God.  And I saw a cop car. 
[02:27:30]  So I fucking start high-beaming and beeping, and the cop stops.  I swear to God, I get out of the car and go, she took my glasses.  She took my glasses.  And the cop's like, who took your glasses?  So I-  And what are you doing here, you idiot?  Oh my God.  Of course.  And the cop-  Oh, you were just driving by, making fun with them, right?  Well, it was kind of the truth.  And he just knew I was an idiot from Jersey, and he got my glasses back.  And he just goes, just go home.  Just get out of here.  Just go home.  If I see you here again, I'm gonna fuck you. 
[02:28:00]  Snatch my glasses.  Another great visual.  Snatching the glasses.  For wasting my time.  For wasting my time.  Let's go to Joe in Alabama.  Joe?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy, I just started using a cock ring here a couple of weeks ago.  And I'm getting nice wood off of it.  But I'm wondering, how long can you leave the thing on before you do some damage to your mule?  I don't use them.  I would use one, if you wanted to use one once in a while, just to get like a real, a sick rod.  But I mean, it can't be healthy to force your body to do something like that. 
[02:28:30]  No.  I mean, I don't know.  But how long do you leave it on for?  I don't know.  30 minutes or whatever.  No, that's fine.  Yeah, sure it's fine.  You could probably leave it on for hours.  I don't know.  No, no.  It's just, I'm getting nice wood off of it.  It's all veiny and blue looking.  It's definitely a blue vein throbber.  No fresh blood getting in there.  Why can't you just get nice wood?  Well, I do, but it makes you feel better when you bust a nut.  Sometimes you think you get like a, you know, it's like soggy.  It's decent.  You know, you need a little extra boost. 
[02:29:00]  We know you're in studio there, Twitchels.  All right, Joe.  All right.  One more here.  Let's go to John.  But where I got my glasses, it was like a face slap.  When she took my glasses, it was like, it was like, it was like I was slapped in the face.  John.  Hey, how you guys doing today?  Hey, man.  Hey, I'm going to tell you a story, man.  When I was a couple years back, I was a young guy.  I went to a Chinese massage parlor. 
[02:29:30]  These guys, these ladies are the worst, okay?  I was getting massaged from this lady, and I could not come for some reason.  And she's like, hurry up, hurry up.  You finish now.  Oh, you pay extra.  You pay extra.  There's nothing worse in the world than some woman rushing you to come.  Yeah, customer service in those places is never good.  Yeah, who do you complain to?  Do you know there was one sexy one I went to, though, one time?  It was a Chinese place.  I don't go for the Chinese places, but I went for this one.  Well, you're on your stomach, right?  And here's how they beat up law enforcement or whatever. 
[02:30:00]  She wears a short skirt, and there's a mirror across the room.  So you're getting your massage, and as you're looking towards the mirror, you can see her bending.  She's bending towards you.  Oh.  And you can look right up her skirt and see her ass in the mirror.  So it's so fucking sexy.  And then you know where you stand.  That's right.  And if she didn't have awful breath, I would have enjoyed it more.  What rotten, rotten breath she had.  It was.  Well, Bob Kelly had a funny line.  He goes, they always have bad breath. 
[02:30:30]  It's because they live in the place.  They're actually.  What do they say?  They're eating fish off a.  What are those little room things that you cook something on?  A hot plate?  Yeah.  They're eating fish off a hot plate.  That's exactly what it's.  Oh, God.  Exactly what it's.  The calls continue to come in.  Matt in Virginia.  Matt.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, we're just kind of hanging, I guess, today.  About two years ago, me and my brother decided we were going to share a hooker.  So she comes out to the house, and I decide I'm going to go first.  And I'm hitting her doggy style.  And her head got, like, two feet within a candle, and her head lit on fire from the 
[02:31:00]  hairspray in her hair.  And I had to stop, drop, and roll her and throw a blanket over her head.  Nice.  Good shit.  Did you have to pay extra for that?  No, actually.  Yeah.  But it was quite scary.  All right.  I guess we'll stop here.  O.B. Anthony.  It's like radio on steroids.  With extra small testicles, I have little balls.

Oh, yeah?  And this guy wants in.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, what's up?  This is really boring, brings nothing to the show, guy.  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey, guys, what's up?  I saw South Park the other day.  Yeah.  It was really funny.  I like South Park.  I'm a South Park fan.  I remember once I watched it with my sister. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  And it was really funny because we were both watching it.  Yeah.  And we laughed, and she laughed, and I laughed.  And sometimes when she comes home from school, we watch a taste of South Park.  It's funny.  All right.  You're not really bringing anything to the show.  But I watch South Park, and sometimes my mom watches it, too.  And she watches, and all three of us watch.  And it's really fun because it's like a family thing.  And we all watch it.  It's like really fun because South Park is funny.  You're totally, you bring nothing to the show.  What happened?  I thought I'm funny. 
[02:36:30]  I'm not funny?  You're boring, and you're not bringing anything to the show.  Oh, man.  Oh, but did I mention that I watched South Park?  Yes, you did.  Oh, man.  Oh, I'm sorry that I sucked today.  I'm sorry.  But I'll call back later with another story.  All right.  Well, great.  Thank you.  Bringing nothing to the show.  Oh, I apologize.  Sorry.  There you go.  Guy?  Oh, goodbye.  He brought nothing to the show.  Absolutely nothing.  Hi, who's this?  Hi, I'm a be-the-joke-to-death guy.  No, we just had that guy on.  Yeah, look.  I got my radio on, and I'm boring and not funny like everyone else who calls the show. 
[02:37:00]  Look, my radio is on.  Ha-ha.  I'm at Roosevelt Field.  Look at me.  I am so cool.  Ha-ha-ha.  Ha-ha-ha.  Beat-a-joke-to-death guy.  All right.  You're really beating that joke to death guy.  Hey, look.  My radio is on.  I'm at Roosevelt Field waiting for you guys.  Look.  I can hear myself.  Hee, hee, hee.  Look at me.  I am so cool.

Oh, we love new characters.  Who's this?  Hey, am I calling 100?  Uh, I think you might have the wrong station, sir.  Wait.  I didn't get my big-ass card yet.  Oh, you're calling the wrong show, sir. 
[02:38:00]  Hey, I want to pledge 30 listeners from my office.  No, no, no.  You're calling the wrong show.  What about the Donna Summer tickets?  Uh, that's actually, that's kind of our show, but...  F-Jackie.  All right.  See ya.  I think that was calling the wrong show guy.  Yeah, it could have been.  Yes, that was calling the wrong show guy.  I guess I should read this email from, uh, from, uh, who is this from, uh, nope, nope, nope.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Uh, uh, Breon, Breon from Chicago, uh, from, Breon from Philly. 
[02:38:30]  Okay.  Guys, I tried calling today about 40 times and no one answered.  I mean, I'm listening to your show right now.  It's about midnight here in Chicago.  Come on, guys.  Answer the damn phone.  Syndication guy.  He wants to be syndication guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Syndication on delay guy.  Right.  All right.  Here's, uh, gets offended and can't take a joke guy.  What's up, bro?  Uh, hey, guys, listen, I mean, really, I understand you guys are all about comedy, but with the 
[02:39:00]  homeless, it's just not funny.  I mean, you guys don't understand what it's like to be homeless.  I used to work with the homeless.  It's just not funny, guys.  Don't you think maybe.  I mean, there's a line you don't cross.  But it was kind of funny to have them in a bunch of, a mall with a bunch of people.  No, no, no.  Guys, you really don't get it, do you?  I mean, you really think that this is funny.  No one's laughing.  No one finds this amusing.  It's really, you cross the line.  And can't take a joke guy.  I'm just offended.  And by the way, I'm also.  I'm assuming that you can't take a joke because you were once homeless. 
[02:39:30]  Well, I, I, yes, and I once worked with, and I also now work with the homeless.  And I'm also pretty upset at South Park because they're blaming it on that Puerto Rican guy.  I work with a lot of Puerto Rican guys who are always accused.  It's just not funny because it's really, it's really sad when it happens, guys.  All right.  I'm sure I'll call you guys back later.  All right.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  It gets offended and can't take a joke guy.  Yeah.  Oh, I don't like that character.  No.  No.  You know why?  Because we had that guy on the phone so many times with different voices, different names. 
[02:40:00]  But since we got here, believe me, enough calls from him.  Hi.  Who's this?  Hello.  Yo.  Yeah.  What's up?  What's up?  It's Paul.  But I've got a character for the show.  All right.  Really stone guy who calls up with something that he thinks is really cool to say on the  air and then forgets everything he was going to say when you guys put him on the air.  Stone guy, you're on the air.  What do you got, man?  I don't know.  Just hanging out at work bullshit.  No, you can't.  You can't. 
[02:40:30]  Sorry.  Yes.  Now you're a cursed guy.  Hanging out at work doing a whole lot of nothing.  Your character sucks.  We didn't like yours.  His character sucked.  He was sucky character.  And you can't call up and say, I'm going to be such and such character.  You just got to be the character.  You be the guy.  Don't you get it?  I don't get the want to be a character on the show guy.  Oh, by the way, I don't answer to my name guys calling back.  Uncle John.  Hey, Uncle John, what's going on? 
[02:41:00]  Uncle John.  Uncle John.  I hear something in the back.  John, you there?  Uncle John.  John.  Jim, what's his name?  It's Uncle John.  Uncle John, you there?  Hello?  I hear something in the background.  Hey, if you're on the phone right now, say hi.  Say hi.  Hi.  Hey.  Oh, hey, you.  Talk.  What's up, Uncle John?  Who?  Me?  Oh, wow.  Hey, I made it through.  Wow.  What's up, Uncle John? 
[02:41:30]  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Well, now you're answering to Uncle John.  Who's Uncle John?  I'm Fred.  I think you might have.  Oh, that's it.  Very good.  Thank you, Uncle John.  See ya.  But then he answered.  We caught him, Anthony.  Hi, who's this?  Hello?  Yeah.  Who's this?  It's Opie and Anthony.  What's going on?  Help me.  What's wrong?  What's the matter?  I'm stuck in foundrymusic.com.  You're stuck in foundrymusic.com?  I clicked something and I can't find my way out now. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a fun sight.  I hope.  So you...  My real player rolls up and now I'm in somewhere in a dark corner.  I don't know where I am.  You don't know how to get out of foundry music?  No.  You went too deep in, see?  Everything's stuck and it's blurry.  You gotta leave a trail of breadcrumbs.  Somebody ate them.  To find a way out of that goddamn sight.  Are you clicking out of those pop-ups as fast as you can? 
[02:42:30]  That might help.  Don't they call them pop-backs now?  Pop-backs?  Where they pop up but they end up behind your window so that at some point you look at the  toolbar on the bottom of your monitor and you got 50 windows opened up?  Maybe that's where I went wrong.  We're gonna get through this together.  Keep your nose up.  Keep your chin up.  We're gonna get through this thing.  Hang in there, bro.  You'll get out of foundry music eventually.  All right, there he goes.  I hope he's trapped in foundry.  I understand.  I feel his pain.  Hi, who's this?  I got a character.  I want to be a long-winded wow story without a point. 
[02:43:00]  You know, like the other day I was driving downtown 7th Avenue and I wasn't sure which  way I was gonna get out of the city and it was Wednesday.  You know, whiffle-mout Wednesday.  Right.  And, you know, I was gonna go through the Lincoln Tunnel but then I thought maybe I'd  go through the Holland Tunnel.  And, you know, I was driving along and I saw a blonde in a red convertible but, you know,  she didn't wow me because she drove past me.  So, I, you know, instead I went through the Battery Tunnel because I realized I actually 
[02:43:30]  had to go out to Staten Island for something.  And, you know, there's another chick driving by.  She had a Volkswagen Cabo Lake.  You know, real cute.  And, you know, she didn't see me but, you know, I was, like, still driving.  That's backhand.  Oh, my God.  And then, you know, I said, all right, maybe I'll go to the mall because it's nice out.  Maybe some chicks will be out by the mall.  So, I was driving out to the mall.  Oh, this guy's a little too good.  Long-winded wow story without a point, guy.  Thank you.  Thank you, gentlemen. 
[02:44:00]  Thank you.  We'll save you from the train.  You gotta just be the guy, though.  You can't say you're going to be, you know what I mean?  Right.  Exactly.  We go right to the phone and you're the guy.  Just be the guy.  Just be the guy.  You don't have to announce it.  Makes it fun for everybody to guess what guy you are.  Right.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  How you guys doing?  Hey, good.  Pretty good.  What do you have for the O.P. and Anthony show today?  Well, guys, I want to let you guys know, you know, every time I'm listening to you guys,  like today when you guys talk about South Park, I drove my car right into a pole. 
[02:44:30]  It's so funny.  It's a little hidden pole.  And the other day when you guys went to the mall with those homeless guys, and I laughed  so hard, I crashed right into a pole.  I keep crashing my car.  You know, when that woman was licking Sandy Cain's toes?  Yeah.  That's what I did.  I crashed right into a pole.  I'm going through cars like crazy listening to you guys.  I'm assuming that you're crashing my car because the show's so funny, guy.  That's who I am.  I'm the guy that crashes.  I'm going through cars like crazy, guy.  He's crashing his car.  You know what?  I bet when I listen to myself right now, I'm going to laugh so hard, I'll probably hit 
[02:45:00]  it in a pole.  You're going to crash your car.  Yep.  I'm going to crash my car.  Oh, no.  I'm going to crash right now.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  I got to go.  Crash my car because the show's so funny, guy.  Yeah.  How many times have you heard that one?  Hi.  Who's this?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hi.  Who's this?  What's up, man?  I want to talk to Opie and Anthony.  You're talking to Opie and Anthony.  No, no, no.  I mean, I called the Opie and Anthony show.  I want to talk to Opie and Anthony.  No, you see, you're talking to us.  Dude, you're on the air. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, you're on the air.  No, no.  Yeah, I called in.  I want to talk to Opie and Anthony.  I'm calling from Cleveland.  Yeah, hey, Cleveland.  I'm calling to talk to Opie and Anthony.  It's the...  You want to know what I want to talk about or what do I do now?  No, you're on the air, so now you should just say what you want to say.  Yeah, but I want to talk to Opie and Anthony.  Hello?  This is...  I think I'm still talking to the phone screener guy, Anthony.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you.  I think I'm talking to the phone screener guy.  Jerry, what's up?  You're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, what's going on? 
[02:46:00]  Hey, Jerry.  My life sucks, man.  What's the matter?  I'm thinking about taking it.  Taking what?  My life, man.  Yeah?  I can barely do it anymore.  What's the matter?  Are you depressed?  Just everything sucks, man.  You know, and I don't have an Xbox.  You don't have an Xbox.  Are you trying to be suicidal and only my favorite radio guys can save me guy?  That's it, man.  Oh, damn.  I got it.  I got that one. 
[02:46:30]  You guys rule.  All right.  Bye.  Later.  Big Kev.  Hey.  Hey.  What's up?  You guys need something?  Wow.  I'm the guy who wants to provide stuff for the show guy.  What do we need?  Kitty pools?  Kitty pools.  Are we going to get a kitty pool?  Oh, inflatable kitty pool.  Inflatable kitty pool.  Yeah, I should be able to come up with that.  He's gotten a few of those before.  He said pool.  We need pools up.  What do we need?  But he said pool.  Three?  At least.  How many do you need?  I think we need three.  By when?  Tomorrow. 
[02:47:00]  Okay.  Shouldn't be a problem.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  There goes Big Kev.  Hey, what's going on, bro?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  What do you think of the Nintendo GameCube?  We're not even talking about gaming right now.  Oh, allow me to introduce myself.  I'm a call-the-show-totally-off-topic guy.  Goddamn, he got me.  Luigi this year.  Son of a bitch got me.  You got us, all right?  GameCube is going to be the one that fades away.  Tanks.  That's the one that is not going to last. 
[02:47:30]  How do you think about it, though?  I have nothing.  I don't care, off-topic guy.  I'm PlayStation 2 guy.  So we're talking about the contest tomorrow.  You don't call up with a GameCube comment.  Contest?  But, man, Xbox is advertising like crazy.  You're ruining the guy's bit because now he's on topic.  Yeah, true.  Sorry.  I'm going to Texas to listen to myself, guys.  All right, bye.  Dick.  That's possible, though. 
[02:48:00]  Of course it is.  Anthony, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I thought our big cat was bring bad guests into the studio, guy.  Or on the phone.  Well, he's trying to change his character, obviously.  All right.  Good for him.  All right.  Thank you.  Later, boys.  Bye.  Hey, you're talking about the guy that delivered the guy that was in the Lost in Space robot  suit.  Not the voice.  The guy that was in the suit.  Probably the best guest we've ever had on the show.  And Dr. Smith, right?  Yep.  Joe, what's up?  Hello?  Hey, Joe.  What's up?  Hey, I'm an incredibly boring guy. 
[02:48:30]  How about your turn down the goddamn radio guy first, you tool?  I'm the guy that's going to turn down the radio because I'm a head-shaking news guy.  What is he talking about?  I don't know, man.  Unbelievably true head-shaking news guy.  Unbelievably true.  The stories that you just hear them and you just shake your head and say, I don't believe  it.  So you're the unbelievably true head-shaking news guy?  Yep. 
[02:49:00]  I don't think that character's really going to take off.  Oh, my God.  You guys are going to wreck our bit.  Sir.  You're going to wreck our bit.  Yeah.  I don't think.  We need this bit to last another day or two.  He's ruined the bit guy.  He's ruined the bit guy.  He just was.  No.  I heard him.  No.  You did, too.  No.  Let's go to Peter.  Peter, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, yeah.  I have a great story for you.  Oh, cool.  I was playing on GTA 3 with my girlfriend, right?  Yeah.  I saw this car on the screen and everything.  Yeah. 
[02:49:30]  And so I get out of my car and then I.  Hello?  Peter.  Peter, what happened?  We need to know the end of the story.  Peter?  Is he gets disconnected in the middle of the story?  Yeah, I think he is.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was it.  But you're still connected.  You're supposed to hang up, I would think.  You have to have confidence in your bit.  It's ruined the bit guy, too.  You just ruined your own bit.  I tried.  He wanted to stay on the phone and he didn't want to make that supreme sacrifice. 
[02:50:00]  Wait on hold for an hour.  You don't want to hang up right then.  All right.  I'll give him that.  We should have.  I mean, every day we do have that guy.  I've been on hold for two and a half hours, guy.  And I have nothing to say.  Chris, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I just became lie your ass off to the call screener guy.  Why?  Why?  Sometimes you've got to do everything to get through, man.  You're lie your ass off to the call screener guy. 
[02:50:30]  So now you got through because it says on the screen that you're going to be representing New Orleans.  I don't have a New Orleans accent.  He was up.  I didn't even have a phone number to give him.  He says he's up here with the military.  Ah, smoke another one.  So you lied.  And now I'm on your show.  And you have nothing, though.  Hey, bud.  I have a part.  But now you're the character.  I'm the character.  Guy that doesn't sound like he's from New Orleans. 
[02:51:00]  I get really tired of these new characters.  You guys rock, man.  All right.  Bye.  That's pretty funny.  That's funny.  Hi.  Who's this?  What day?  Hey, what's up, bro?  Hey, what's up?  You've been on hold for an hour and 20 minutes.  Hey, Norton.  What's up, Norton?  No, Norton's not here today.  Norton, you rule, man.  No, Norton's not here today.  He has something to do.  Mario Cantone.  What's up, man?  Take your balls out.  No, it's Opie and Anthony.  You waited an hour and 20 minutes to do this.  Brian Regan?  No, Brian Regan's tomorrow.  Oh. 
[02:51:30]  All right.  I can't figure out who he is.  You guys suck.  Hold on.  We're going to give you something for being on hold the longest.  Oh.  All right.  Thanks.  An hour and 20 minutes for that.  Adam Ferrara.  No.  Adam.  Hold on.  None of those guys are here.  What's up, Adam?  Are you?  No.  Ben, what do we have for this guy?  Is this say hello and you rule to people that aren't there, guy?  No, it is.  Okay.  I think it is.  We have an Aerosmith prize pack for you, sir.  All right?  You get that for being the guy on hold the longest today, right?  Hey, boss.  No, no, no.  No, no. 
[02:52:00]  Bits over.  Thank you.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm going to give you the prize.  That's for real.  Let's go to Oscar to start.  What did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Oscar, what's up?  Hey, boy.  Hey.  I learned that today I just became.  I'm really getting sick of all these new characters, guy.  You're not alone.  And that really stinks, especially since I called in before as can't take a joke, guy.  Take it easy, pressure.  All right, bye.  He's two guys on the show, guy.  This is from guy who instant feedbacks what I learned today but doesn't get read as much 
[02:52:30]  as Dan from Hoboken, guy.  And he writes, today I learned.  Ah, why bother?  It's not going to get read.  Look at Steve Peay.  He says, Anthony is easygoing guy, except when he's explaining why he's easygoing guy.  He's absolutely right.  Hey, everybody.  It's Stephen Lynch.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  And also, I have heard this.  If I could be a superhero, I would be an awesome man. 
[02:53:00]  I'd fly around the world fighting crime according to my awesome plan.  And if I saw criminals trying to lie, hurting other people and making them cry, I'd haul  them off to jail in my awesome van.  Because I would be awesome man.  Yeah.  Then I say, kids, now you know.  We all know that when people offer you drugs and alcohol, like me, you just say no, right? 
[02:53:30]  If I could be a superhero, I would be a drug-free boy.  Telling the world of the evils of drugs and all of the lives they destroy.  Well, I'd take all the junkies getting so high with their needles and bongs and their sticks  made of Thai.  As I burn them alive, I would squeal with joy.  If I could be a superhero, I'd be immigration dude. 
[02:54:00]  I'd send all the foreigners back to their homes for eating up all of our food.  And taking our welfare and best jobs to boot, like landscaping, dishwashing, picking our 
[02:54:30]  fruit.  I'd pass a lot of laws to get rid of their brood, because I'd be immigration dude.  Now you have the kids imagine what superhero they would be.  They could be any superhero.  If you could be a superhero, would you be Justice Guy?  Making sure people get what they deserve, especially women who lie.  Like if a wife left her husband with three kids and no job to run off to Hawaii with some 
[02:55:00]  doctor named Bob.  You could skin them and drain them of blood so they'd die.  Especially Bob.  Then you would be Justice Guy.  Or you could be more subtle.  I didn't mean to be vague.  Give her the mad cow disease.  Let him die of the plague.  As long as they suffered for their horrible lie.  Especially Bob.  Then you would be Justice Guy. 
[02:55:30]  Yes, then you would be a superhero like me.  Steven Lynch.  There you go.  That one's for the kids.  Dan Anthony.  XM 202.  The NBA.  He's got nothing but open court in front of him.  The NBA on ESPN Radio.  Show me what you got, though, mama.  Down the way.

[03:00:00]  And now, the worst.  Black of Opie and Anthony.  This show sucks!  It's awful.  Well, I got something to play for you.  All right.  Because you guys do have this obsession with Mike Brady.  Oh!  What's an obsession?  Pretty obsessed with him.  Maybe.  Sure.  Here's him describing the first time he ever kissed a girl.  Really?  To one of the kids.  Yeah.  From the Brady ones.  Hi, sweetheart.  You like my dress?  Mom, can I talk to Dad for a minute? 
[03:00:30]  It's kind of a father something.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Since I don't really know where to start.  Uh-huh.  Well, how about the beginning?  Well, Dad, did you ever kiss a girl when you were my age?  Yeah.  Wow.  Long pause.  Yeah.  Uh, well, uh...  For Christ's sake, say something.  Excuse me, Bobby.  Bobby?  It's a father-son thing, Dad.  Stop. 
[03:01:00]  Come on, Bobby.  Come up to the bathtub with me.  Let me smell your breath.  Long pause.  Uh-huh.  Well, how about the beginning?  Well, Dad, did you ever kiss a girl when you were my age?  Yeah, I kind of remember that I did, huh?  Did something special happen?  Sure did.  Her father walked in.  Yeah.  I throw up. 
[03:01:30]  Her father walked into the room.  I found him much more attractive.  So he's stuck in my keister, and look at me now, losing weight rapidly.  It's the story of a man named Brady, and he's wearing pants that get looser by the day...  How about the beginning?  Well, Dad, did you ever kiss a girl when you were my age?  Oh, my God. 
[03:02:00]  Let's see skyrockets. 
[03:02:30]  Would that mean you're in love?  I mean, her father had his dick out.  I mean, that depends, I suppose.  It could.  People who are in love get engaged, right?  Yeah, well...  And then they get married.  Well, I think in your case...  In some states.  Yeah, well...  And then they get married.  Well, I think in your case I'd recommend a long engagement.  How long?  About ten years.  Some love and marriage and engagements, it's a wonderful business, but you want to make 
[03:03:00]  very sure about those skyrockets.  Make sure, huh?  Thanks, Dad.  I'll keep in touch.  And by the way...  How can you do that?  Those weren't firecrackers.  They were T-cells exploding.  A little something for you guys and your obsession with Mike Brady.  Yeah.  Because of the Mike Brady thing.  We can't stop talking about him.  This is hilarious.  Oh, with his little robe and slippers, last days, walking around the hospital, 65 pounds. 
[03:03:30]  Why couldn't I have liked girls?  The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Looking at the screen, what does this feeling mean?  Got this shiver way down deep in my lawns.  A blonde-haired beauty.  Ooh, ain't she a cutie? 
[03:04:00]  The best in every club that she joins.  She teases all the fellas.  Her little sister's jealous.  This goddess from her head to her toes.  She wears a groovy skirt and a flowered print shirt.  Turning heads wherever she goes.  And oh, the things she does to me.  I, I, I, I got my very first boner watching Marsha Brady on a black and white scene of TV. 
[03:04:30]  Yes, I did.  I, I, I, I, I, I got my very first boner watching Marsha Brady on a black and white scene of TV.  Oh, yeah.  Golly gee.  Fillmore Junior High, her sparkling blue eyes. 
[03:05:00]  A smile, anyone would die for.  I almost lost my load on the Hawaiian episode.  Mimi saw me knocking on her door.  She's sweeter than a peach in her bikini on the beach.  The other girls couldn't compare.  What a piece of ass when she took that hula glass.  Her skirt so short I think I saw her hair.  And all the things she does to me 
[03:05:30]  Pure in her virginity  I, I, I got my very first boner  Watching Marsha Brady on a black and white Zina TV  Yes, I did  Golly gee  I, I, I, I got my very first boner

[03:08:30]  George worked in the oil business  And got a big laugh one day  Watching a buddy of his strike out with a young lady  She'd asked him for a light  But the man's pack of matches was no match for a gust of wind  The funny scene stuck with George and gave him a bright idea  George built a pocket lighter with a little chimney inside  No matter how windy it was, that lighter always lit  To help sell his creation, he sent samples to the U.S. military 
[03:09:00]  Orders came back for thousands  Today, the lighter is still a hot seller  Sales are over 10 million  George Blaisdell gave it a name you know  A name reflecting his pal's bad luck with the lady  He called it the Zippo  With The Success Journal  I'm Chris Whitting  Hi, this is Tom Torbjornson  With America's Car Show  Tip of the Day  On XM Radio 
[03:09:30]  Your tech replaces the sensor  In the performance system  And while he's at it  He replaces the battery  Then he says  That he has to drive the car  To relearn the computer  What's this?  When a computer system in your car  Has a problem  And a sensor or battery is replaced  A relearn procedure has to be performed  This is how the computer is taught  To operate within the parameters  Programmed into it from the factory once again  It's kind of like rebooting your home PC  To complete this relearn or drive cycle  A certain set of driving instructions must be followed 
[03:10:00]  The carmaker may require that the vehicle be driven  At 50 miles an hour for so many miles  And the blower motor and the heating system  Is turned on to high  Next, the high beams may have to go on  Then the car is left to idle for 5 minutes  And the engine shut off and restarted  Got a question?

[03:10:30]  Hey, morning fellas  Good morning  Morning  I heard you guys touch a few times  On the Arbutt Dwyer video  And maybe a couple days before  The first time I heard you say something  Was the first time I saw it  And this guy  Is the most selfish  Fucking  Motherfucker  And saddest dude I've ever seen  Yeah  Yeah, you gotta agree with him  He keeps himself in the face  Gotta agree with him, Mikey  So hard that it messes up his hair  Yeah, his hair flies off his head 
[03:11:00]  Cody, have you ever seen the rap video  They made out of that?  Uh, no, I haven't  Fantastic  I gotta get my buddy Buzzy  To maybe mail me a copy  He still has it  You know, I've heard you guys talk about it  And I've never  You know, you've talked about it in passing  But never heard what you think about  You know, stuff like that  As far as it affecting  The things that you've seen  And stuff like that  I can't, uh, I can't watch it  Yeah  Yeah, me either  It's really, really disturbing to me  Uh, I can watch the rap video 
[03:11:30]  That was made out of it  They put that video to a beat  So you see his hair going up and down  Up and down  And then they forward and reverse it  Yeah  So it looks like he's dancing almost  Yeah  To the beat of the song  As he's shooting himself in the head  It's, uh  A buddy of mine moved away  And I left a message on his MySpace  That had a little GIF file  Of him putting the gun in his mouth  And then taking it out  And it said  I miss you so much  I could kill myself  But I won't  Oof, wow  Car crash  You know  A little bit 
[03:12:00]  A little bit  That, uh  That clip  Things like the  Ogre-ish  You know, you've got Ogre-ish  I know Jimmy likes going there  Ben loves that song  Ben loves it  I can't watch that  I'll watch any form of pornography  You want to show me  I will watch it  Girl  Horse  Guy  Horse  I don't care  Guy  Chicken  I don't care what kind of  Sick, deranged sex  Is going on  Because you believe in death now  That's why  I used to  I could watch a beheading  Like it was 
[03:12:30]  I ate potato chips  When I was younger, man  No, even as a kid  Things like that  Disturbing  My parents  In all their  Infinite fucking wisdom  Back in I guess  1967  Or whatever the hell it was  68  Decided to take me  To the drive-in  To go see  Bonnie and Clyde  With Warren Beatty  And I was  How old was I?  Six years old?  Something like that  And I'm watching it  And I thought it was  Kind of  Cool movie  Gangster thing 
[03:13:00]  A little gross and stuff  But at the end  When Bonnie and Clyde  Just get mowed down  And  That's so fake  I know  But dude  At the time  For six  It's fake now  You're a six year old kid  It's like 1968  So you know  This was before Star Wars  When  That explains those eyes  You're not used to seeing  Yeah  He's a fucking pussy  I didn't know  Anthony  You're not used to seeing  That shit  Anthony's a puss  We had gone to Arby's  Before the theater 
[03:13:30]  Or the movies  Because you know  The Comac drive-in  That used to be there  There was an Arby's  Across there  And I just loaded up  On Arby's  Had my little puppy belly  All full  And I'm watching  And then there it is  Warren Beatty  And what's her name?  Faye Dunaway  Faye Dunaway  Get out of the car  The little birds go  Out of the bushes  Where the gunmen are  And then  Clyde looks over at Bonnie  They look at each other  Like we're fucked  Here it comes  And  Just machine gun fire  Their eyes getting shot out 
[03:14:00]  Blood  I fucking went  I threw my Arby's up  All over my father's car  All over the Rambler  Every year you learn  You put the  Anthony puzzle together  Here's the new part  Of the puzzle  This is why  During his explanation  You can see  Anthony's a hopeless  Romantic  That's why he's very  Monogamous  You're right  He's romantic  Because  Part of that story was  They looked into  Each other's eyes  And that's what he  Pitches for him and his woman 
[03:14:30]  That something goes down  And they just both go out  In a blaze of fucking glory  You're a romantic  You're a utopian  You're an ass  You just hoped  The world was better  How do you do this show  Dave  I know Anthony goes home  And cries  And praise the God  That God knows  Is just a  God thank you  I only do this for money  Like Opie  Really enjoys  Destroying a life  He'll talk about it later  Like dude  I thought it was funny  When he just  When he had pubic hair  In his face  And his mother 
[03:15:00]  Called in  And was crying  It was hilarious  Anthony's like  When they looked  Into each other's eyes  And it was  Did you  I'm thinking  Did you cry  On a slap scene  In Jaws  When the lady  Came over  And go  You knew my  You knew it was a shark  The little  Kittner boy  Did you hear that  Fucking  Did you hear that  Explanation  About the movie  I saw his eyes  And they warded up  They're starting to blink  A little too long  Like Pussy Boots  From Shrek 2  Is that a horrible 
[03:15:30]  Anthony has feelings  They looked at  Did you catch that  They looked at  That was the part  That made him throw up  Is the love  The love that was destroyed  It was metaphoric  It was  Because they just saw  Like oh fuck  We've been through  All this shit  How do you feel  About the shooting scene  The sunny scene  At the toll booth  Did you throw up  No I was older  I was older by then  Didn't see it  In the movie theater  Really  But that didn't  Really get to me  Why  It was worse  When I watched 
[03:16:00]  Fucking Sonny  Get cut down  He starts to scream  They shoot him so much  That is one of the  Most realistic  Gun scenes  I've ever  Fucking seen  That is horrific  Where he just gets  Shot to the point  Where he goes  Stop killing me  I'm dead  I just haven't  Fallen down yet  I saw  Bonnie and Clyde  They had the fake  Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta  Tummy gun movement  Yeah  And the thing that  Pained you  Was the love  That was destroyed  Maybe that was it 
[03:16:30]  I didn't even realize it  Until you're saying  No  You just told everybody  Fuck  Maybe  You know I leave  You really have feelings  Sometimes I leave this place  Of course he does  And I go  Alright  We may have destroyed  A life  But  Think of the joy  We have given to so many people  He always makes  Deals with himself  He makes  I'm constantly  Having an internal  Monologue dialogue  Spiritual deals  With yourself  To say it's not so bad  It really bothers him  Some of the things he did  But that was my angle 
[03:17:00]  With my dad  Because my dad  Would call me out  On stuff  That we did on this show  I'm like  But dad  There's a lot of people  That are commuting  And we're just entertaining them  And they have miserable lives  And they found enjoyment in that  So maybe  I hurt one person  But I made  Thousands of people  Very happy that day  One person had to be sacrificed  That's how I  Had to explain it to my dad  Because he was like  What is wrong  Do you ever feel bad  What's the  Has there ever been a time  You went home 
[03:17:30]  And went  Fuck  Not  Fuck we might get fired  Right  There's been plenty of others  But just  Fuck man  And I'll tell you one thing  Was that  Now that you bring that up quickly  That overrides  Any feeling bad  The  Oh fuck we fucked up  We might get fired  Override  That  That is an override in my head  I could give a flying fuck  The eyes go away  The fucking feeling  The  Oh  All goes down the shitter  When I think my fucking job  Is on the line  The 
[03:18:00]  The  The fire  We  Right  We know fire  Top priority  Super  Super  Everybody  And then you probably  Qualify to fire  Like  Hey man  You know  Steve-O and  E-Rock gotta eat too  Baby  We're responsible  For the lives  To make you feel better  But has there ever been a moral one  Where you just went  That  Wasn't there one thing  That like in the studio  And we decided like  Oh my god  There was one thing  Patty  Nothing  I think it was  Oh nah 
[03:18:30]  Was it the  Was it the crying midget  The midget we made get naked  And she started crying  That was  That  That was close  We made  That was  That was a close one  I'll be honest  Now somebody  Within an hour  After the show  I was eating a steak somewhere  And drinking some wine  Or whatever  Going wow  That was a great show  Lenny Clark  Was it Lenny  Yeah it was a porn midget  Lenny Clark  Wanted a naked midget  Opie knows the story  Because he knows  Everything that has ever happened  He's a walking  Fucking library 
[03:19:00]  Honestly  I don't know if Lenny Clark  Was involved  But I know the story  Was something like this  There was a midget  And she was trying  To become a stripper  She wasn't in porn yet  Oh right  You're talking about  The porn midget  That was really cool  We interviewed her as well  No I think I know  The one you're talking about  She was just a miserable midget  This girl was from Long Island  Or Queens or something  And she called Steve  Or somebody  And said look  I'm a midget  Because we were talking  About getting midgets  On the show  A long time ago  And she wanted  To be a stripper  And we're like  Have you ever stripped before 
[03:19:30]  She goes no  I haven't done anything  But I wanted  To maybe give this a try  We'll set it up  Where it's like a strip club  Well why didn't you strip  For us for the first time  So she comes in  And she's such a little  Little thing  That she's standing  Right on the console  In front of us  We're all kind of  Just looking up  At this midget  Not only that  This console  Wasn't like it is in here  You see we got  A lot of headroom  There were a lot of  Like electronic  Shelving and stuff  Over our heads  So she was the only  Human being  And I use that term loosely 
[03:20:00]  That was able to stand up  Completely stand up  Between this shelving  And stuff  Which was  It made it hysterical  That she fit in there  She was so short  And she's standing up  On the console  And we're all watching  We put on some  Motley Crue  Or some fucking  Cliche strip club music  And get her dancing  And we start  Like telling her  To take her clothes off  And you can tell  She's pretty reluctant  She doesn't really  Want to do it  And she starts  Undressing  Yeah  I guess she got her top off 
[03:20:30]  Yeah  And she realized  This is just not for her  And this was a bad idea  But at this point  We've been whipped up  Into a frenzy  And you know  So she just kind of  Was like  Her eyes went blank  Patrice  They just went  To another place  A whole nother land  The land of Oz  And we're  You know  Kind of suggesting  She take her pants off  And her panties  And she's just falling apart  You can see it  Yeah  And she like  Take  And she's just in her panties  With them midget legs  And stuff  And the big  Like Popeye arms 
[03:21:00]  Big fat midget legs  She got the fat  Little bent midget legs  All her limbs  Look like little  Baseball  Wiffle ball bands  With that meat  That meat by the knee  Fucking cocktail  Frank fingers  And then toes  And then she's like  Topless  And she's getting ready  To like take her pants off  And then she just loses it  Starts crying  She starts crying  Says I can't do this  And we're just like  She's like  I know  And she's trying to  Cover up with that  Little fucking hand  That looks like a muffin 
[03:21:30]  And she's like  Holding over her breasts  And trying to  See that's where  And it was like  We just went like  See that doesn't bother me  Because I could have  Talked her  Into not feeling that way  You know what I mean  Because she had a feeling  Yeah but there's no fun in that  But it's  But she  But your whole anger  Would have been  Girl you're up there  Just let go of any dignity  You have left  Yeah because you already  Being an obscure midget  Who's thinking about stripping  Is way worse than  A stripping midget 
[03:22:00]  That makes you somebody  For a couple of years bitch  Right  And fetish  A lot of motherfuckers  Have those midget fetishes  Or whatever  But that wouldn't bother me  You know  Like Patty  Patty's standing there  Looking like  Auschwitz  Really bothered me  Like she just  Was a  That shivery old mess  And it just  Shivered  Bag of bones  And I know  By the time  You know when I  Stopped feeling bad for Patty  Is when she was  And I'm talking about  The mousetrap thing  Yeah  Is when she was crawling 
[03:22:30]  And you could tell  She was  In it  Into the thing  Where she was like  Oh god  It hit my arm  And then  Oh what is that  And I go  Okay she's  Doing it  But just  That nakedness  Right there  That fucking  Got to me  Yeah  A little bit man  You can't feel  For someone  That doesn't feel  Thank you  Thank you  Jesus Christ  My latest quote  I know there was  One  I know there was  One thing  How do you feel  For someone  That doesn't feel  He  He's  See

[03:26:00]  You don't watch a lot of news either  Do you  No I watch a lot of news  And it doesn't bother you  It does bother me  I would have thought that  You don't watch the news  You don't come out  Because even homeless people  You want to give money  To every homeless  You want to help  Oh my god  You're making me  You're making me  Too simple now  Not simple  But you have  No no  Your explanation is too simple  Now  Because I don't fit into  The mold you're trying to fit me into  I almost fit  But they're like 
[03:26:30]  I can't get the arm in there  What the fuck  There are a few things  That make no sense  With this picture  You're opening  Homeless people  I could give a flying fuck  About them  And Patrice  I feel no guilt  I get annoyed at them  I do  I dish out  To the homeless  Absolutely  That's why you'll never understand  This relationship  In this radio show  Just when you think  You got it figured out  You're like  What?

[03:27:00]  Should dress in stinky clothing  When they go out to dinner with you  Yep  A little more complex  I'm not that bad  Just a little more complex  I'm not far away  From utopia  I have some sympathy  For the pains of the world  Yes  I do  I feel some sympathy  For the pains going on  In the world  You're like a middle  Age Italian version  Of the Green Mountain  Oh I got flies  Coming out of my room 
[03:27:30]  Here's the question today  And the guy just hung up  On us  What's the worst thing  Anthony has done  On this show  Because if you ask  That question about me  There's a million  That come up  You're the  He's done some horrific  Things too though  I've done some bad stuff  That you started  There was a time  When we were in Boston  Anthony enjoyed  Calling funeral homes  Oh right  And asking to talk  To the deceased  Yeah you know  How they list the funerals  This is a funny bit  And original  God damn it  Thought this up 
[03:28:00]  You go through the obituaries  And they list  Where and when  The service is going to be  So when the service  Is there  You call up  And whoever answers  You go  Like is  Is John Smith  There today  And they say yes  Because he's laid out there  They think you're asking  Obviously you're asking  If the body is there  Is John Smith there  Yes  Could you put him on the phone  The silence  The dead silence  The deathening silence  That you just get 
[03:28:30]  And then you get  Yeah  He's there  Just put him on  I really need to talk to him  He's  He's the deceased  You get like  This puzzled  Fucking  And we laugh  Our fucking ass off  We laugh  And laugh  And laugh  The Alzheimer's home  That we called  The  Oh shit  That was you  That was you  Yeah  Oh  Fun fun stuff  Was that your idea  To call the Alzheimer's  I don't know whose idea it was 
[03:29:00]  But I  It does count  I did it  It counts  What do you mean  When we called  Old Bill  The Alzheimer's clinic  Oh  Oh  That is  Hello  Thank you please  You've heard this right  No  Oh my god  Is it even on this version  Four or three old bitties  At this Alzheimer's helpline  And called up  And just made them feel so badly  For this poor old lost guy  You've never heard this  No  You've been with us for years  Old Bill  By the way  Someone is calling you out  Saying that you were there 
[03:29:30]  For the dancing midget  Patrice  Are you shitting me  Patrice was there  She wasn't crying  That chick wasn't crying  The one that stopped dancing  In the middle of it  That chick  That's why  I don't remember  It didn't bother me  That chick was crying  Dude  We had to stop the bitch  I was there  Yeah we did stop the bitch  I was there  In the  In the  In the  Fucking room  Holy shit  Wait  But Nicole Starr  Might be the porn midget  That sounds like  A porn midget name  See there's a confusion here 
[03:30:00]  Cause we gotta  I was there during a minute  Get your fucking midget straight  Is Nicole Starr  The  Nicole Starr was one  Naked midget  That was on the air  Yeah of course  We've had more than one  Naked midget  That's the one I'm thinking of  I think that's the one  He's talking about  God where else  One naked midget  Where else can you hear  An argument where guys  Are like well Jesus  We had more than one  Naked midget  No it wasn't that  It wasn't that midget  Motherfucker  Right  I remember what midget it was  I got the arguments  Of a witch naked midget  Fucking 
[03:30:30]  I was at a midget  I was at a midget  Right  Very early in the time  When I stopped coming  Doing the show  Yes  And I  That's what I'm saying  It didn't bother me  Yeah  Alright  Nicole Starr  The naked midget  What's this  A porn site midget  With morals  I don't get it  There's a thousand pictures  Of this chick  Without her pants on  Yet she gets all nervous  Around us  Yeah that's the chick  That is an actual  Porn star midget  Yeah  We're talking about  A girl that wanted to  Get into stripping 
[03:31:00]  I wasn't there  We brought her in  Off the street midget  I wasn't there  We brought her in  Off the street  She awkwardly started  Taking her clothes off  And then just lost it  And someone was saying  That Colin Hanks was there  Colin Hanks  It was Colin Hanks  And Jack Black  And Jack Black  Jack Black  Alright that was with  The porn star midget  Alright that was porn star midget  Alright see everyone's  Getting confused  By the way two more guys  We were talking about this  Yesterday that no longer  Do the show  Oh hell yeah  Forget about it  Jack Black 
[03:31:30]  You never get Jack Black  Jack Black used to do our show  He was plugging Tenacious D  Back then that was it  Jack Black would come in  And do our show  Every time he was in New York  And we haven't seen him in years  His biggest movie then  Was that  He played the soldier  And Tom Hanks' son came in  And it turns out that  He was such a huge fan  Of the Opie and Anthony program  He was getting bootleg  Tapes of our show  Sent to LA  And he came in  He couldn't believe  He was on our show  And now he  He's blown up  He was in  King Kong  He was in King Kong as well  Yeah  I don't think he's blown up yet though 
[03:32:00]  He's getting there  He's in the shadow of death  Ah you never know  Maybe we'll get him  Nah we're done  I think it's possible  To get Tom Hanks' son again  Yeah  I think so  But maybe  Tom's probably like  Look at  Yeah  Don't fuck up Da Vinci code for me  Yeah  Drew this hair like this  I gotta fuck around like this  I want it to work out  This is the question  Today though  What is the worst thing  Anthony has done  On this program  Trying to think  Some people are saying this  I'm gonna play this for Patrice  Because he's never heard it  But here's how I qualify  Worst thing though  Participating 
[03:32:30]  Yes  And Opie's evil  Does not count  To me  Oh no no no no  But like Anthony  Hold on  Some of the evil  No no  Some of the evil  He's right there with me man  I know  He's talking about initiating  I'm talking about  I'm talking about  It's like  It's like  Gang mentality  It's like  Opie might be the first one  To hit Rodney King  With the thing  And Anthony's like  Alright  Fuck it  I hit him in his kneecap too  I'd rather use the Reginald Denny

[03:35:00]  In Boston  And uh  Place was packed  Uh we'd go up  There and give away  Shirts and shit  And have people  Come up and you  Know show us  Your fucking  Weirdest scar  For this fucking  Bit of shit  From the radio  Station  You know  Typical stuff  Uh and  Wheelchair Fred was  There so we brought  Him up on stage  And now I had  Seen wheelchair  Fred he didn't  Have spinal cord  Damage  So it wasn't  Like he was  Paralyzed  His legs were  Just so fucked  Up that he  Couldn't walk  So he was in  A wheelchair  But I had  Seen him at  The station 
[03:35:30]  Get out of  His chair  And steady  Himself on  The console  And kind of  Shaky leg  But he took  His hands away  And he'd be  Standing  So I thought  It would be  Great  Holy crap  Yeah  Trying to make  Yourself feel good  No no no  You can't even  That was the  That was my  You can't even  Record how long  He was standing  Without his hands  Oh I know  It was like  It was like this  I'm not trying to say  No hands  What'd you say  You couldn't even  Record  No recorder  That could record  As fast as he fell 
[03:36:00]  Point  20 zeros  And then a one  That's how long  He could stand  But  The fractions  Don't go that low  But you know  I had a few in me  I had a few in me  So I get this idea  Zero  Zero  Zero  Zero  Zero  Zero  Zero  Now the people  Didn't know this  A lot of people  Thought Fred was paralyzed  So I get this idea  So he was a known  Yeah  Like radio figure  On the show  Known  Known to be  Paralyzed  Wheelchair Fred  Thought to be  Completely paralyzed  Thought to be paralyzed  A lot of people 
[03:36:30]  Misunderstood  It wasn't just his  You know  Fucked up legs  They thought he was paralyzed  You know  Christopher Reeve  Paralyzed  Oh my goodness  So I think  I get drinking some beers  With the excitement  On stage  We bring wheelchair Fred up  He gets a huge ovation  Because people love them  And I get this idea  And he's wheeling  Yeah  You wheel him up on stage  They actually  The crowd has to lift  The wheelchair up  And place it on the stage  Yeah they lifted him up  On the front  So he's like crowd surfing  In his wheelchair  For a little while  And they put him up on stage  Now I'm thinking to myself  I'm thinking to myself  This would look really cool 
[03:37:00]  Because I've seen him stand up  If I do a faith healer thing  And get this crowd whipped up  And he stands  They're going to think  I'm fucking Jesus Christ  So I'm going  Fred  You want to get out of that chair?  You want to get out of that chair?  The crowd just goes with him  Yeah  And he's going  Yes I want to get out of the chair  He just goes right with you  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  Falls right into it  Falls right into it  I'm like Fred  He goes right with you  And I slam my hand on his head 
[03:37:30]  And I'm like  Fred feel the power  Of Jesus Christ  Flowing through you  I feel it  And the crowd  Oh Jesus  People crying  Dude  They were freaking out  And his arms  Now grab his armrest on his chair  And start shaking  His legs are shaking  And every inch  He moved out of that chair  The frenzy  In this crowd  Was un-fucking-believable  I got to the point  Where I actually felt like  I was channeling Jesus Christ 
[03:38:00]  What kind of frenzy  Like  They're going  Like the average  Like  Dude  You've been to our live shows  Wide-eyed  But was it  Like  Wide-eyed amazement  They thought this motherfucker  Was paralyzed  Like couldn't move  And I'm here  Holding his head  He's shaking  And now his legs are working  He's getting himself  Out of the fucking chair  Wait a minute  And the crowd's going nuts  And so Anthony's going nuts  Because the crowd's going nuts  But is it like  Opie and Anthony crowd nuts 
[03:38:30]  Or is it like  Holy shit  It's like both  Church nuts  It's like  Both  It turned into a  Like you heard gasping  Like oh my god  Fred go  Everyone got caught up  In the excitement  Everyone  Especially me  Wait a minute  This might just happen  And you were just going  Bananam  I'm going off  I like  Fred  Fred you don't need  This chair anymore  Feel the power of Christ  I feel it  I feel Jesus  So he starts getting up 
[03:39:00]  He's holding on to the chair  And now he's up  He's standing  But he's holding  But he's holding on to the chair  And again the crowd  Just going crazy  So I'm like  Alright Fred  Let go and walk  And we pulled the chair away  And we kind of  Because we're like  You don't need that chair anymore  Now walk to the microphone  And he lets go of the chair  We pull it away  He shakes  He wobbles a little  He goes to take a step  And falls flat on his face 
[03:39:30]  You're missing one detail though  He's very close to the microphone  That the lead singer is going to use  Right  With the mic stand  Right  So he has no wheelchair  And this was  This all took place in less than a second  By the way  He has no wheelchair  And he realizes  Oh shit I'm in trouble  And grabs the mic stand  That the lead singer is going to use  Thinking you know  He could use that to support himself  It's not connected to anything  Oh my god  He goes down like  You just heard like 
[03:40:00]  Just  Like the mic falling  And him  And  And then  And then just feedback from the  The microphone  And then  Dude  We're just silent  Dead silence  Dead silence  And then  And then  You'd hear like  From the middle of the crowd  Yeah  You'd hear like  From the middle of the crowd  Some  Motherfucker  You're a fucking asshole dude  You're fucking guys 
[03:40:30]  You  You motherfucking cucks  And  The crowd turned in a second  I was Jesus  I was Jesus  Patrice  We gotta leave  We had to leave  Here's the deal too  They were gonna kill us  Before we did the wheelchair Fred thing  You know  We went up there  With like dopey DJs  Hey welcome to blah blah blah blah  And hey here's some CDs  And t-shirts  And blah  So we gave out all this crap  Like I think  The WAF ice scrapers  And CDs  And keychains  You didn't really establish yourself  This was a  I know 
[03:41:00]  Yeah  We were doing pretty good  Let me establish the evil  That could  Right  Right  Yeah you're right  The potential evil  Hadn't been established  Yeah we were there though  So  So then there was dead silence  People were like  What the  The grumbling started  What the  Who the  And all of a sudden  Patrice  They started throwing  Winging everything  We gave out  Everything we just gave out  At the stage  AAF keychains  Coming back at us  Which I was thinking like  Wait it's a joke  It's funny  Look at the fucking gimp  Wait a minute  Wait a minute

[03:42:30]  And thought it was  Fucking hysterical  Oh yeah  So we knew we had  An audience out there  Yeah we went on there  And told the story  Just how it happened  We had Fred on  See cause the club  Maybe fit  I don't know  200 to 300 people  So it was only  300 of our listeners  That actually saw  How awful we really are  And then we went on the radio  The next day  And told it to  Who knows  But they didn't call  Like those people  Didn't call  Going you fucking  Here's another thing  Here's another thing  It was a music station  So all the fans  That came to the station  Events  Weren't just fans  Of Opie and Anthony

[03:48:30]  That's coming any day now  I punch the thing  I've seen in movies  That I've never seen  In real life  Fuck you  I worked in a warehouse  I know exactly  What it looks like  You worked in a warehouse  Where?  House  Up in Massachusetts  Massachusetts  What was in this warehouse?  Software  What was it?  Housing  Software  Software  What did you do?  Drive the forklift?  I unloaded the trucks  And we didn't have  Back in my day  We didn't have forklifts  We had something known  As a pallet jack  The pallet jack  The pallet jack  I hated the pallet jack  Your truck would back up 
[03:49:00]  And it would always be  Like an uphill thing  And you'd be pulling out  Your lower back  It's like  It's one step above  Just pulling the pallets out  With your bare hands  Oh yeah  You'd slide this thing  It kind of  They want you to think  It's like a forklift  It's got two forks on it  And wheels  And a handle  And you have to run  Like as fast as you can  Just to get the forks  Into the pallet  Because the wheels  Get caught on the wood  And it's got to be set  At the exact proper height  It's like no power  It's like only from  Power steering  To no power steering  Yeah no power steering  You run full blast 
[03:49:30]  Bam you hit it  And then you've got to  Jack the thing up  With some kind of  Little pump handle  And once it's off the ground  Now it still weighs  There's no  No little  Pulley system  Or any type of  It still weighs  Exactly what it weighed  Before you picked it up  With this thing  But now it kind of  Has some wheels to it  You've got to pull it  Out of this truck  Any incline  Yeah  You ain't getting that  No  It's not working  What a thankless job  It's a fucking great job  Oh it's stunk  Shut up  I loved it  You hated it 
[03:50:00]  No it was great  It was all the wise asses  Who fucked off in high school  Fun to hang out with  Those people  Yes  But the work itself  No career goals  So there was like  No competition  Just getting drunk  None  No one had like  Any of those jobs I had  No one  Had anywhere else  They wanted to be  No  There was the old guy  There was always the old guy  On the job  That you  You assumed  Had a dream sometime  But he's like 55  Pushing 60  And he's  He's like still doing this shit 
[03:50:30]  Oh yeah  And  And he's happy  You know  He jokes around with the guys  I worked with the old guy  He was a Vietnam vet  And he used to be one of those guys  Would like literally  During the course of the day  Drink a case of beer  Yep  And would completely be fine  Had the same guy  Used to drive the fucking truck  With the sheet metal in it  And drink Schlitz  Tallboys  Yeah  That he would like  Sneak into the truck  And the whole way  I'm talking like  Maybe a 30-40 mile drive  With the sheet metal in the back 
[03:51:00]  And he's just drinking Schlitz  Oh yeah  And you'd never notice  I went out drinking him  With him like one time  And it was like one of those deals  The only time you're on the same beer  Is the first beer  And then the rest of the time  You had like  Literally have like a line of beers  And you're like  Just trying to suck this shit down  And this dude is just like  You guys ready for another one?  This guy worked in like  In Vietnam  He was like in the DMZ  You know  Yeah  He had one of those  Anti-aircraft guns  That he had  He had pointed like horizontally  And would just shoot  Into the fucking tree line  We'd get him real hammered  And get him to try to talk about 
[03:51:30]  Those things  The Vietnam stories  Hey Frank  How many people do you think  He killed?  I don't like talking about that shit  And we just fucking killed  It had to be  80 gooks  Yeah  A few beers later  80 gooks  We called it air  Air support  Naped them  All of them  But none of these guys  Ever had like  Anywhere else they wanted to be  Oh yeah  They were happy to be there  They were looking toward like  Hey you think we're getting the raise?  You know  They're negotiating the raises  For the guys  And it's supposed to be like 
[03:52:00]  3% the first year  And then 4% the second year  And I'm looking at what my pay is  And thinking what 3% of that is  And it's like  We're fighting for scraps  For dollars  Oh it's great  You wouldn't miss any sporting event?  No  You either went to it  Or you watched it?  Yeah  You didn't have work to do  In the next morning  You unload trucks  I got it  I was mentally prepared  For this job in third grade  I can do it  Out till all hours  Getting smashed  And just show up hungover  You know what's funny?  I had absolutely no expenses  I was making like  I think like 260 bucks a week 
[03:52:30]  Right?  I had absolutely  Yeah  By Tuesday every week  I was just totally fucking broke  And had absolutely nothing to show for it  Never went to the bank  There was no bank in my life  I took the money that I had  I couldn't even  I had to go to the company's bank  To cash my check  Because I didn't have a bank to go to  Where it's like  And you learn that by going to some bank  With your check  And go I'd like to cash this  Do you have an account here?  No  Well you can't cash it here  Well how am I  And then you get an attitude  How am I supposed to fucking cash it? 
[03:53:00]  Or make an account?  I need the money now  You can't use that language  I need the money now  It's good  Call the number on the check  It's good  And you're just like a dirt bag  And I'd have to go to the company that I worked for  Their bank  To cash the check  And it would just end up  This wad of cash in my pocket  And that's where it would stay  And I'd go to the bar  And boom  You're buying shots  You buy your cigarettes  You buy whatever you need  And by yeah  Tuesday, Wednesday  Just wait for the canteen truck to show up 
[03:53:30]  You'd eat that shit food  You still somehow had a flat stomach  Because you're so fucking young  You keep working out every day  You play basketball during the break  In your fucking tight 80s jeans  Come back in dripping sweat  Did you have credit with the coffee truck guy?  I didn't  Other guys did  I had credit with him  And it was like  There was some weeks  I'd have to hide  And not eat  Because the coffee truck guy would pull up  And I'd be well into him  For quite a few bucks  But I had blown my money  So now I can't get anything to eat 
[03:54:00]  Because I have no money  I can't get credit from the truck  Because I'm exhausted  With my credit there  And I'm hiding behind equipment  Peeking out  Waiting for him to leave  As he's  Like with his change thing  On his belt  Not making eye contact  With anybody  He's doing business with  Just looking around for me  His head is spinning  He's kind of looking  And he's off  And then I'd see him  Oh you know  I was out on a job  And I'd pay him finally  And then I'd be broke  Hey where's your friend Anthony?  He's cutting up boxes 
[03:54:30]  Yeah he's around  I don't know  I saw him earlier  Tell him I want to see him  And then I'd get paid  And I'd have to pay  The coffee truck guy  And then I'd be broke  Like on payday  That was the worst  Where you had some big debt  And then payday  And it's gone  And now it's Friday afternoon  And you're broke  You know it's funny too  You could actually  I had like two or three times  There was like physical fights  Amongst different employees  But because it's a warehouse  And no one gets fired  And you just go back to work  And guys like all sweaty  With their hair sticking up  This fucking asshole  Yeah it's not like 
[03:55:00]  A real placement business  Oh yeah there was this one guy  Fucking prison yard  This one guy at work  Who was just a raging  Raging alcoholic  And he came in one time  I swear to god  It was like  It was like 11.30 in the morning  You're supposed to be there by 8  And he comes in  His hair is soaking wet  From his shower  And he tries to pull  Oh yeah the traffic was brutal  But it's like one highway  We all came up there  It's like dude  You went out boozing  And he's like dude  Shut the fuck up  Let's do one of those right  So we were making a run  To Dunkin Donuts 
[03:55:30]  And they call  Hey Paul you want anything  He's like nah  I'm all set  And a buddy goes  How about a rum cake  And that was it  Fucking on the mat  Just going at it  Hey hey hey  Dunk it off  Dunk it off  How about a rum cake  Fucking change all over the floor  And then you just went back to work  Yeah  We would have to check in  Every morning  And I'd get in my truck  And I was habitually late  Like every fucking day  I could not get there on time  Late every day  And you'd have to check in  The second you got in your truck 
[03:56:00]  And you were driving in  So I'd be still putting my shirt on  And just grabbing at the mic  16 to base  Yeah  Base to 16  Go ahead  Yeah I'm right around the corner  But I'm going to have to stop  And get some gas  Yeah truck needs gas  Alright we'll see you  When you'll get here  Meanwhile  I have like no gas  But now I can't get gas  I have to drive there  Hope no one looks  And notices I don't have any gas  Because I didn't stop for gas  Then I have to start this whole story 
[03:56:30]  With the fucking guy  With the gas  You know he pops the hood  Looks for the old fucking oil  I needed oil  I'm like dude  I gotta get to work  He's there with the tire pressure gauge  Dude wow  You got booze on your breath  Oh it's  And it was every morning  Like every morning  Like I thought they were retarded  Every morning there's a problem  The traffic  I would use the traffic  Or I would call in  I'd be like  Yeah  How you doing  No no I've been up for hours  I've been up for hours  Fine 
[03:57:00]  I got gravelly  Hungover  Drunk guy voice  Obviously  Oops  Obviously I've been  At any given moment  Somebody had lost their license  For drinking and driving  And of course you would still drive  So you'd park your car  Behind the dumpster  All this fucking hilarious  I remember  I had this one job  In this warehouse  First day I get there  Like I thought the last one was crazy  Like this one was like  Everyone there  Like the first one was  Was just like alcoholics  I went to the next one  Everyone was like coke heads  And I walked in there  What the fuck was this guy's name 
[03:57:30]  He was one of these guys  Like six foot seven  And weighed like 111 pounds  And he had like  You know the electronic  Pallet jack  Yeah  And he kept driving  Right to the edge  Going I'm gonna drive  It off the dock  And everyone was just  Kind of nervously laughing  And I'm sitting there  What the fuck  Is with that guy  We used to use some pretty  Like hardcore machinery  In the sheet metal shop  Big cutters  Where you were taking sheets  That were ten feet 
[03:58:00]  By five feet long  Oh you worked in like  The Bruce Springsteen  Fucking warehouse  Oh dude  It was just  It was  You're making the shit  I'm gonna cut up some steel  Well I'm cutting up some steel  I'm hoping Wendy  I get a big record deal  It was just  It was one of those awful  Fucking Allentown  Bell  Just horrid places to work  And you're putting  These big sheets of steel  These what amounts  To giant razor blades  Into machines 
[03:58:30]  And cutting them up  Into smaller pieces  To be bent up  Into duct work  To be loaded onto a truck  To be driven to a job  To be installed  And that's what the fuck  What the job was all about  And the machines  We were working around  There was something  Called a brake  You ever see ducts  They're square  How do you think  You get that 90 degree bend  In the sheet metal  So nice and tight  It's something called  A brake  I've often wondered that  I'm sure you have  You take a piece of flat sheet metal  You take a piece of flat sheet metal  Put it in a brake  And it's a big wedge 
[03:59:00]  On this big V-shaped thing  And it hits the metal  And boom  Bends it into a 90 degree angle  And you do that a few times  And you have a square  And we're running these machines  Drunk off our asses  Just drunk and stoned  Everyone in the shop  There wasn't one person  That at 12 o'clock rolled around  We didn't go to the bar  And OTB  That was right next door  And just slam shots  Bet a few horses  And go back 
[03:59:30]  And run this machinery  You just did everything  That's going to keep you  In that job  Yeah  Exactly  Right  Right  Exactly  Nobody's buying a self-help book  No  How to get your money  To work for you  Nobody's doing that  Fuck it  You're betting horses  With money you don't have  Buying booze  And going back  And working with some  Of the most dangerous machinery  There were things called  Clinch collars  These round things  That you'd have to put  In the duct  To then extend pipes off of  That would go to the vents  In the houses  And they were stapled together 
[04:00:00]  Now you've got to staple  Through sheet metal  So there are these  Giant Bosch staplers  That are foot activated  And these  Your fingers are  Like  Millimeters away  From the actual mechanism  And you're just stapling  And every so often  Bam  Someone's thumb  Would get caught in there  Finger  And you'd laugh at them  You'd just laugh  You'd try  Yeah you fucking stapled  Your finger  Asshole  It's a whole nother world  A whole nother mentality 
[04:00:30]  Hey we gotta go to the phones  They've exploded  A lot of people  Are relating today  Carl in New Jersey  What's up  Hey what's going on  Anthony you're such  A fancy man now  That if you met yourself  Then  You'd be scared of yourself  You'd be scared of you  I would be  Petrified of myself  I would chase me away  Corporate fuck  Get away  It's amazing  How much Anthony  Has changed in the last  11 years  Get away from me  You bum  Someone's just  Drinking Perrier  Sparkling  Yeah I see that 
[04:01:00]  With a fancy shirt  Like he just stepped  Off a fucking yacht  I was at the hotel  All right  He's got a fancy shirt  On and everything  I am horrible  They gotta photoshop  The old Anthony  With the new Anthony  I have abandoned  Anything of the old me  I've just abandoned it  He is a chef  It was  Let me tell you  About the hatred  I had for that job  Like I had a good time  Like I understand  What you're saying completely  There were some people  Some of the funniest  Motherfuckers I ever met  Ever  Were on job sites 
[04:01:30]  They were hysterical  Fucking laughed my balls off  The job was thankless  The work was just  You'd be on a rooftop  And it's 100 degrees out  The black tar roof  Is 120 degrees  And you're with a sawzall  Some guy telling you  Cut a 10 foot by 10 foot hole  In this roof  Because we landed a unit  There this afternoon  And you're sitting there  Cutting through tar  And gravel  And sheet metal  And precariously  Perched ladders 
[04:02:00]  That could kill you  At any minute  It just  No safety  No  No nothing  And you're constantly  Like sweating  And working hard  And it just sucked  And then winter rolls around  And now all the sheet metal  Is covered in ice  And you still gotta put it in  It was horrible  I knew this was coming  Don't look back fondly  At the work itself  Chris in D.C.  Yeah I just wanted to note here  That it's quite obvious  As if we all didn't know 
[04:02:30]  That Opie  You haven't worked  One honest fucking day  In your entire life  This 20 minute rant  That Bill and Anthony  Are going on here  And you're just  Sitting back quietly  I got a fucking thing to say  You know there are times  When there's some  Nice conversation going on  I want to be part of the  I want to be part of it  And I'll try  I'll try to get in  And say something  Or maybe direct the conversation  I have no fucking clue  Why don't you tell people  How you caddied  At the Crescent Club  I caddied at the  Huntington Crescent Club  That was Opie's regular job  I caddied from the years 
[04:03:00]  From when I was 12 years old  To 26 maybe  Sit down Opie  I was a caddie  For 14 straight years  I worked in a video store  Where I watched pornos  With my friends  And I got fired from that  Because I refused  To turn the pornos off  When other people  Were coming in  To rent regular movies  With their kids  And I was a temp  To hire for  For  A temp?  Yeah  A temp to hire for Xerox  Up in Rochester 
[04:03:30]  Yeesh  Those were the only jobs  I had  And then I went into radio  That's it  That's it  No warehouse  Or sheet metal  No Bruce Springsteen  Jobs for you  I was the guy  I was in shipping  For Xerox  Yeah but not shipping  Where you're loading trucks  No I had a like  You were the guy  The paperwork guy  I was the paperwork guy  You had like a uniform  No no  Build something out  Hand it to one of the men  And he will go and load  This truck with the equipment  What was it called?  A dispatcher? 
[04:04:00]  Oh something  I don't know  You're right  Chris you're right  What can I tell you?  I wandered around America  Trying to get into radio  While these guys were  Working their asses off  Good stuff  Hey  Have a good day  Alright  Bye  Yeah I never had a real job  Let's say hi to Joker  In California  Joker  Hey Joker  Hey Anthony  We used to work out there  Bed and sheet metal  In California  I used to get up  Every morning  Just high  Before we go to work  Yep  And I had a little axe 
[04:04:30]  To cut my ear off  Your ear?  My left ear  How did you cut  Your fucking ear off?  Maybe lifting a piece of metal?  That's exactly what it was  Yeah  The money of mine  Was supposed to be  Carrying the other end  Oh fuck  I looked around  And it dropped it  Which made my hand  Go up and slice my ear off  Oh wow  That rocks  That is rough  The worst day  Working there  Was when the sheet metal truck  Would come for deliveries  And they'd drop off  A new load of sheet metal  And it had to be taken off  One sheet at a time 
[04:05:00]  So you got me  And my brother  Or me and some other guy  Poor squad  That's working there  Some other alcoholic  You put on your gloves  These big heavy gloves  And take one sheet off at a time  And hope that every time  You're not going to just cut  Your limb off  You drop a piece of that metal  And it hits your leg  Or your shin  Or something like that  Your leg will be sliced through  Like a razor blade  And that's what you're working with  On a daily basis  Razor blade  Razor blade  And any other kind of cuts 
[04:05:30]  You'd get every day  You'd cut yourself  Some way, shape, or form  You'd just hope  It wouldn't be that serious  That day  I was making these L brackets  Yeah  To hang something off of once  And I hold on to one end of it  And I'm drilling the other side  Not realizing that  When the drill screw catches  It's just going to turn this thing  Into a handheld saw  Because it's a little bracket  That I made  Out of sheet metal  And I'm holding one end  And I'm drilling the other  And it caught  And spun in my hand  And just  Still got it right there  Wham!  Ripped through the palm of my hand 
[04:06:00]  And you know what you do?  You put some duct tape on it  And finish what you're doing  And then maybe go to the hospital  And have them stitch it up  See, I can't imagine that  This is the same guy  That would be doing all this  That was it  But this is a funny thing  As people are standing around  Asking if he's okay  People are actually holding back  Laughing  Laughing  You would laugh at the guys  And they'd hurt themselves  Dude, you okay?  There were guys with the fucking  The nail guns  Every day on the job  Some idiot would slam 
[04:06:30]  One of those fucking nails  Through a finger  Or his hand or something  And it's just  Hey, Jesus  The nice fucking work  He's got a nail  Through the palm of his hand  You can come here  We'll get the pliers  He can pull it out  No sympathy whatsoever  None  Let's go to John in Jersey  John  What's up, boys?  Good morning  Good morning  I used to work for  As a electrician  Before I became a paramedic  So I actually had to  Work for a living  And on Fridays  We'd go to the bar  Which is right next door  To the electrical shop 
[04:07:00]  And just get loaded up  From like 4.30  Till 7.30  7.30  Till about 9.30  Was fight club  We just  It started out  Just, you know  Each of us  Getting into a fight  With each other  Over some stupid  During the week  And it became a game  The boss actually  Would referee the fight  In the yard  Next door  We'd go back to the yard  To beat the shit  Out of each other  I mean  Hitting each other  With like bales of wire  And stuff  And it was  The best job I ever had  Only for the fact  That we did fight club  That did fight club  On the job 
[04:07:30]  Healthy work atmosphere  I had this guy  Six foot six  I was giving him shit  And I swear to god  He was like  Further away than you are  And I turned my back  And he hit me with a jab  It was unbelievable  I couldn't believe  He caught me  I thought it was like  Safe away  Far enough away  Oh dude  He tagged me  Sounded like the white light  For half a second  Boom  I so respect  What you guys did  Because there's no  Human resources  And all that bullshit  If you had a problem  With a fellow employer  You would  No you duked it out  You duked it out 
[04:08:00]  You made his life  A living hell  For a day or two  It was how hockey  Used to be  You couldn't  You couldn't run  To human resources  No  We have to deal with that  On radio all the time  We say the wrong thing  To someone  And they go running  Off to human resources  The next thing you know  You're in meetings  And all that bullshit  No  Not these guys  That I do  The radio show with  You could keep your job  Just based on  Certain little talents  That you had  You didn't even have  To really be good at it  Like I  Me  I know I had a job  Because my license  Was clean  There were guys  That couldn't drive 
[04:08:30]  They were great workers  But they couldn't drive  To the jobs  So like  Alright  Go with Anthony  We'll you know  Send you out to this job  Here today  You know  I was one of the guys  With a clean license  And I could make anything  Out of 8 inch round pipe  If I needed to  I could just bend it flat  And cut it with the snips  And like  You ever see those IQ tests  Where it's like  What would this  Folded up look like  You know  Like a box  I would have failed that  Miserable  That was what my job was  I'd go to like Manhattan  I'd come in here  And they'd send me 
[04:09:00]  Into a brownstone  Where it was some custom job  They didn't know  What it was  They'd send me in with metal  And just go  We don't know  What this lady needs  Just make something  And you'd have to look  And measure  And draw it out  On a piece of sheet metal  And then cut it  Bend it up  Screw it together  And install it  And that was like  My talent  I could do that  You actually had a skill job  Mine wasn't  That was it  No it was cool  Unloading boxes  And putting the right shit in  That was years after  The shop and the warehouse  Shipping it  No it was cool about Anthony  When him and I  Started working together  And then we got to move  You know 
[04:09:30]  Back to New York  To do radio  We got to do a lot of cool things  On commercial radio  And we would be driving around  This fine city of Manhattan  And Anthony would be pointing out  All the buildings he worked in  Oh yeah  You see that air conditioner  On the top of that huge building  I put that there  I helped install that  That thing  It's the size of a freight train car  And we would be on the way  To maybe a photo shoot  Or some crazy thing  And he would just point out  You know  Stuff he did in his other life  It's another life  Every strip mall  On Long Island 
[04:10:00]  Every one of those  Rexon  Friggin Rexon  Office buildings  In Huntington  In Melville  All those  Crawled around  In every ceiling  Every space  Between the hung ceiling  And the metal floor above it  I was in there  Crawling  Like an animal  I did construction  A week and a half  Is how long I lasted  First of all  I sucked at it  And it was just  Oh it was brutal  Plus it was some dude  I swear to God  Like every day  He'd be wearing  He had these  These jeans  And he had this  I don't know 
[04:10:30]  I told this story before  He had this big hole  In his pants  Just to  I think the right  Of his package  And every day  I'm fucking standing there  Cutting something  And he comes walking by  And steps over something  And the hole  Goes right over  His hole  His whole fucking unit  Was hanging out  That's great  That's what you want  Kevin in Connecticut  What's up Kevin  Hi guys  Anthony how long has it been  Since you shit in a bucket  Since I shit in a  Spackle bucket  Wow that's 
[04:11:00]  That's  Probably  11 years  Does it turn your stomach now  Since I've shit in a  Spackle bucket  There are times  I gotta take a dump  Or I wish I had  A spackle bucket  Around  Yeah that's what  You had to do  You know you go down  Into the basement  We'd be on these  Track jobs  Where they're building  800 of the same house  So you know  It would get  Pretty boring  You'd get it down  To the point  Where you could finish  A whole house  In a couple of hours  Installing the ductwork  In there  And you'd be on the job  You gotta take a dump 
[04:11:30]  And you know  There's no fucking  Portable toilet  It's such a mess  You just grab a spackle bucket  Go down into the basement  In one of these places  Find a corner  To lean in  And everybody upstairs  Is yelling down at you  Shit in the spackle bucket  And that's why  You never opened  A closed spackle bucket  If you needed a spackle bucket  You could carry tools in  Or grab some water  For some  Concrete mix  Or whatever the hell  You need it for  You would never grab one  That's capped  Because you know  If you open it up  What you're gonna see in there  But at least we did that 
[04:12:00]  The animal  Portuguese cement workers  Would just shit  In bathtubs  Like the  People install a bathtub  And you'd walk  Into the bathroom  And there's just shit  In the bathtub  Or if the toilet  Was installed  But the water  Hasn't been hooked up yet  There's just  Dried shit  In the bottom  Of the toilet  People just shit  And piss everywhere  If you buy a new house  It has been shit  And pissed  In every corner  Of the house  Yeah  That ground floor  Yeah  It was horrible 
[04:12:30]  You know what  I don't think  I needed to know that  I didn't know  About that aspect  Let's go to  Tony in Brooklyn  Hey Tony  Hey boys  What's up  Best job I ever had  I worked at a lumberyard  With a bunch of  Derelicts  When I was like 18  So these guys  Would come in  All banged up  From the night before  One guy basically  He made a fort  Out of the plywood shelf  Where he could sleep  All day  And then like  The boss would go around  And find him  He had like a suite  Set up with like a  Like a sleeping bag  And a pillow  And shit like that  Oh yeah  There were definitely 
[04:13:00]  Sleeping days man  The other thing  That was funny too  Was the nail gun fights  Where you just like  You know  Start shooting each other  With nail guns  You'd find your weapon  Of choice  We'd have these staplers  That we'd just have  Fights with  You're absolutely right  Duct tape was the  Magic bandaid  Didn't matter what it was  Yeah you deal with it  When you're done  Yep  Alright punch it out  Alright thank you sir  Let's say hi to  Wade in Toronto again  Wade  Morning boys  What's up Wade 
[04:13:30]  Hey Wade  I was just thinking  Opie  You think manual labor  Is the president of Mexico  Hey  That's a funny joke  In Canada  And that was it  Okay  Let's say hi to  Jeff in Mississippi  What up Jeff  What's up boys  Hey  We're just  I'm doing construction  Down here  Trying to clean up  After Katrina  And one of our  Favorite things  To do the new guys  Is when they're up  On an 8 foot ladder  We run a finish nailer  Through the sole of their shoes 
[04:14:00]  Nail them to the ladder  We did that to a new guy  Last week  And when he was trying  To take off boots  He lost his balance  And fell ass first  Into a big mud bucket  And he got stuck there  He's a little  Guatemala guy  He just got his ass  Stucky there  And that was it  We watched him  Roll around like a turtle  For about 10 minutes  That's right it boys  That's right now  That's a good story  There was this short  Little guy on the job  And a couple of the guys 
[04:14:30]  That I worked with  Picked him up  They used to just tease him  All the time  Because he was like  Almost midget size  But he was  He was just above midget  They lift him up  About two feet  Put him against a post  And just duct taped  His ankles  To the post  So he's standing there  And like  Whoa  Trying to keep  From just toppling over  One way or the other  Because they duct taped  His hands in front of him  And his feet  Two feet off the ground  And just left him there 
[04:15:00]  And laughed at him  Throw like shit at him  That's great  It's like prison  It's like prison  There's a hierarchy  There's gags  There's people getting shanked  For to listen to  Opie and Anthony  Is more good  Than to work  In the Fruit Roll-Up factory  Making a Fruit Roll-Up  When I was in Russia  We work and make things  That's so much better  Than your American  Because I  You know  What do you  Let me just  Well you already know 
[04:15:30]  But  You don't want to work  Work good for you  Right  Why you don't want to work  I was farting so bad  And it stunk so bad  You fat American  Right  Russia is so much better  Than you my friend  I think that would be  Something that maybe  People should  Need to know  Okay  Back to work  Time for the Power Shift Minute  The latest from the world  Of motorsports  Here's Joe Costello  After the 2007 season  Is complete

Well, we all know  That Eric had a  Bad breath problem  I thought he was  Finally taking care  Of the situation  Figured, what the hell  Is it gone?  Actually, I think  It's much better  These days  No?  Ben?  Ben apparently  Doesn't think so  I don't know  Oh, you're not on? 
[04:20:30]  I turned about on  I don't know  Sometimes it is  Someone, I don't know  Who it is  Someone in our office  Has bad breath  On a daily basis  So it's one of these guys  It's not  It's after the show  I notice it  Really?  So I don't know  Well, we eat a lot  Of crazy crap  During the show  Maybe it's all  Just kind of  Bubbling in our mouths  You know, here's the test  You do  When you smell it  Look at who's addressing you  And that would be the test  Of that their breath is bad  There you go  How is it a mystery  As to whose breath stinks?  You can't just close your eyes  And talk  Hey, we got Patrice O'Neill  In studio  Good morning, everybody 
[04:21:00]  I'm going to treat you  Like a star  Thank you very much  You deserve to be  Well, you deserve to be  Treated like a star  I always knew it  I'm just looking  I'm just looking at  Anthony's nasty oral gel  Anthony is  Oh, I'm pitching him  Rubbing his stupid gums  With his index finger  Trying to be a professional  That's funny  You don't know the half of it 
[04:21:30]  He has orange  What?  Look at  Read all the stuff  He's got over there  He's got his orange gel  That's his breakfast  That he never got to  He's trying to do  His nice impression  Oh, oh  Brush your teeth, Anthony  He's got  It's easy  He's got peroxide  He's got orange gel  What's that other thing?  Amosol  And a banana  Because he can't chew  Right  And he couldn't even  Try the banana today  Then he's got Advil  And a leave 
[04:22:00]  And what's that  Over there?  There's something else  Did I get it all?  He got bottles of relief  He's gargling with poison  Because  He lost  Oh my god  Oh, Anthony, man  Do you like Anthony's seat, by the way?  Oh, it's great, man  I can fit comfy in there  Usually we give you the crappy seat 
[04:22:30]  But look  You got the nice chair and everything  Look, you got your own sound machine  And you do whatever you want over there  Just start pushing buttons  Let's see if we can find an impression of  Of Anthony upstairs  Hey, Michael  This is my girl  Nope, that is  Dude, Jesus  If you're going to push the buttons  They've got to make some kind of sense  Wait, I see  Oh, dear  Oh, alright  Well, that's  Oh, so this is all his stuff  What you say is  Push, oh, dear  You say, well, this is what Anthony is going through right now 
[04:23:00]  And then you hit  Oh, dear  Right on the thing  Yeah, but set it up first  Go, this is  You know  Oh, okay  Yeah, here you go  Go ahead  Okay, this is what Anthony's going through right now  This is my rifle  No!  Wait, wait, wait  This one right here  Alright  How about you try for a third time, Patrice  See? 
[04:23:30]  See, it's not that easy being the head guy  He, he, he  This is his cold, just in case  Because he knows he has bad teeth  He had to have somebody come in and take his place  And he made sure it was going to be  Oh, yeah  That's not it  Because this is my rifle  This is my gun  No, I switched  Alright, he switched  This is the guy with bad breath, by the way  What's his name?  His brother's hovering over me like a Vulcan  See how easy that was, Ben? 
[04:24:00]  Yeah, gargle with this aura gel  And, uh  Yeah, take this garage  Alright, man  On the rocks  Alright, try it again  I want this one  Right here, man  Alright  Set it up, though  Go ahead  Okay  Anthony's upstairs  Yeah  Getting his teeth done  This is what he sounds like  That makes more sense, don't it? 
[04:24:30]  That works  But it wasn't as funny  This is my rifle  Oh, dear, it would have been good  It was really funny  It was after you said that  Watching Nathaniel try to help you  But not bend  Just kind of lean in stiff  Take care of that rotten mouth  Alright, let's go upstairs  See what's going on  Anthony  Uh, yeah  Hi, Anthony  You guys are a real fucking riot  Move  Move  Move  The trees are playing with my toys 
[04:25:00]  So, uh  What's going on up there, Anthony?  Well, I'm sitting in the dentist's chair  Alright  I've just taken my x-rays  And I'm staring at the x-ray  Of the, um  The tooth in question right now  Wait a minute  You got in to see the dentist that fast?  Yes  I'm changing dentists immediately  Yeah, this guy's pretty good  You didn't have to read magazines  Or any of that crap?  No, I'm filling out the paperwork  As I'm sitting in the chair  And actually getting the x-rays  So, it worked out pretty well  Did he get the Novocaine?  No, not yet  I'm still in, like, utter pain 
[04:25:30]  I'm waiting  They're holding off  I don't know why  Just give me the shot  I need the shot  Why don't you just go to this guy upstairs?  Why don't you just make him the dentist?  If he's right upstairs  This is easiest for everyone  Yeah  Well, I, I, I should  You're going to be canceling your other appointment now?  I don't know  I've got to see what this guy does  If it's a temporary thing, you know  Then I've got to go to a dentist and get it fixed  But if, uh, you know  He knows what he's doing  And it's permanent  Then, yeah, this will be my new dentist  Right upstairs  And he's a Jew  The dentist is a Jew 
[04:26:00]  Which is, uh, very, very good  Shocking  Of course  What did Patrice say?  You don't want your dentist's name to be like Tyrone Smith  Yeah  Yeah  Which one of your teeth hurts?  Oh, shit  I should have been prepared for that one  What's going on?  That teeth is hurting  Oh, man  That's, that's funny, man  Yeah  Yeah, like, uh, you know 
[04:26:30]  There's some races that are good at, uh, doing certain jobs in life  And, uh, the Jews pretty much have the dentistry tied up  And I like that  So does this mouth and sore medicine work?  Yeah  No  No  That stuff down there, like Ambasol and stuff?  No, that doesn't work  That's for, I don't know what that's for  If you, you know, you got a little scratch on your gum  Not for this  Hey, Anthony, why don't you tell Patrice how you were trying to take care of the pain last night?  Oh, I had, um, a bottle of, uh, Captain Morgan rum  And I was, uh, swishing it around by the tooth and spitting it out in a glass 
[04:27:00]  You know, I can't really laugh  You know you want to laugh at somebody's problems  But I had a toothache, uh, a couple of years  It's not  It's awful  It's, you know, it's the worst pain you'll ever have  You almost want to dig, dig something in it and take it out yourself  You know what I'm saying?  So, I do feel for you  But you gotta brush three times a day, Anthony  We were trying to get Anthony to chew on tinfoil this morning  He's grunting and hurting  First thing in the morning, he's miserable 
[04:27:30]  And, uh, Jimmy and I were trying to help him out with some things  We think it's like a popcorn, like, uh, kernel stuck  Stuck in there  Right up against the nerve  I don't see any popcorn kernel  Oh, you're just looking at the x-ray now?  Yeah, I'm looking at the x-ray  It's right in front of me  The way they do it now  It's all done with computer magic there  I'll be the guy, uh, I bite on something  It's got a wire on it  Not like the phone anymore  And it takes the x-ray  And it pops up on a monitor right in front of your face  Like, as he takes a picture  What's he telling you it is or he's not saying it?  No one's in the room with me here  So I'm just staring at it 
[04:28:00]  And it's a big mystery to me  They leave it in front of me for a while  So I could look and go, ew, what the hell is that?  And I don't have any answers  By the way, everyone listening in Alabama  Don't get too excited  You'll have that technology in about 20 years  Well, they don't really need it  The dentist just looks in at the one tooth  And gives you a prognosis  Prognosis is just not a funny word  Don't say it again  The one tooth that gives you a prognosis 
[04:28:30]  Shut up, stupid  Prognosis was the right word, though  It wasn't because you're turning red  You got a little uncomfortable there  You got to make me feel better, man  Now you're good  I'm looking at my x-ray  I see, like, the cap thing  And then I see, like, a post  That's going into one of the root holes  And then I see, like, two root holes  I don't know how they make heads or tails  Is this your first bad tooth happening?  No, years and years ago  You know, I had to get a couple of teeth capped  Oh, okay 
[04:29:00]  So what did you do, like  Shouldn't you have did the, like, exactly the opposite  So you didn't have this happen again?  No, it just came up, like, two days ago  It just started hurting out of nowhere  Wow, hereditary teeth  Fine and dandy  And then all of a sudden  We were making fun of  This is what's creepy, Patrice  We were making fun of dentists yesterday  Yeah  And now this tooth that has been fine for 15 years  It acted up  No, evil dentist karma  Well  What are you going to do?  If you want me to explain further  We have this pickled punk 
[04:29:30]  And we think the place is cursed  Oh, this place here?  Yeah  So that's why  I know that sounds like a stretch  But we were talking about how the place might be cursed  Then Anthony starts making fun of this dentist  That was a pervert  And next thing you know  Anthony has this problem  Yeah, the extra guy  Is that wrong for him to put his mule in my mouth  And say, bite down, not too hard?  No  I'm just such pain  I just want it to go away  So I'm willing to do anything  That'd be so nice if he touches Anthony funny  I really hope I see you on a Lifetime movie 
[04:30:00]  What?  Open, but you can't move like Serpent in the Rainbow  So you know exactly what he's doing to you  Oh, boy  Hey, Anthony, where's Eric?  Getting his teeth cleaned?  No  Oh, he's right here  Well, we were a little confused when he decided to go upstairs  And you didn't hear this part  We thought we were going to kill, you know, two birds with one stone up there 
[04:30:30]  Or is Eric just kind of looking around and going  What is this place?  I've never been to one  What kind of a chair is this?  Oh, you're terrible, man  As soon as you guys walked in  They probably grabbed Eric  And Eric kind of said  No, no, I'm not the problem  It's that guy  Oh, you guys are making me feel much better 
[04:31:00]  So what?  We're just waiting for some kind of  Yes, sorry  I can't  If there were some tools around  I'd start working on myself  But sorry  Until, you know  The guy comes in and starts doing it  It's pretty much, you know  What kind of magazines?  I've got to fill out my paperwork  No, I bypassed the whole waiting room magazine thing and everything  Oh, so you're just right in the room?  Yeah, that's close enough for paperwork  They're taking my paperwork  Oh, I've got some other stuff I've got to fill out on the other page, huh? 
[04:31:30]  Oh, I missed  I've been talking on the radio, sir  Maybe I should fill out some of this paper  You're getting me in trouble  What are some of the questions you've got to fill out?  Just the name, social security number  Crap like that  You can fill out all the time  Why are you now seeking dental treatment?  Ow!  That's all I'm writing  Patrice, do you realize this is a national talk show?  Yeah  You're talking about his bad mind?  Yeah, this is it  This is what we do 
[04:32:00]  Why don't you have Master Poe kick it out?  We got everyone bamboozled  You don't know what caused that?  Wait, Anthony's getting his prognosis  I got a little, uh, I got a little infection around one of my, uh, my tooth gum things  Root things  Oh  Root  What's this little thing here?  Well  Is that a pustule?  Tooth had a root canal  Yeah, the tooth had a root canal  Mmm  It's reinfected  It's reinfected 
[04:32:30]  There's a dark little shadow around the tooth where, where it's infected  But shouldn't something have started that, that could be, like, pulled out of there?  Like, what would start an infection like that?  Yeah  Alright  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm  Oh, you're going to give me Novocaine?  Oh, he's going to numb me out  What can, what can they do for your tooth, though?  What's he going to do for it?  I don't know  He's got to look around  Antibiotics 
[04:33:00]  Yeah  That's it  Antibiotic, doc  Does that, that seem to be with the, uh  Yeah  Right  Oh, boy  I think I'm going to get a needle  Ask him how your tooth gets really infected  I don't know  Yeah, ask him, man  We can learn something today  Yeah, like, how, what do you do to keep  What if I bit down on it hard?  Could that have started this whole ball rolling?  Is it hurting?  If I bit down hard?  No  No, probably not  That's why I'm not a dentist  I'm a stupid radio guy  Nothing I did 
[04:33:30]  Oh, good  It's not my responsibility  Hey, Anthony  A lot of suggestions coming in  Tony from California  Have Ant do a Voss impression  After you get the shot of Novocaine  I won't have a choice  Uh, I'm reclined now  And I'm waiting for my, uh  Oh, please  My Novocaine  I want to see how wimpy you are  He's got to do the needle live on the air  Oh, I hate needles  Oh, I hate them  But it's going to make the pain go away  Oh, it'll make the pain go away  I love when the pain goes away 
[04:34:00]  All right, what's happening, Anthony?  What's happening?  Well, he's going around  He's getting all the good stuff  Oh, first he puts this Q-tip thing  Hey  Dips it in some red stuff  And then rubs it on the gum, I guess  Hey, Ant, put your hand on the end of the chair  Where his cock can brush into it  Here we go  Here we go, listen  I'm opening, yeah  Uh, okay  Uh, uh-huh  Uh-huh 
[04:34:30]  Uh-huh  Uh-uh  Oh, you've got to put the needle in that nerve  In the back of my jaw  Oh, I hate that one  It makes my whole jaw numb  And half your throat  Is there one that you like?  No  I thought it was going to be the localized one  But he's putting it in that nerve that runs in the jaw  But I'm not sure it'll work  It won't work down there  Okay, give me the good one then, Doc  Here we go  I hate this one  Here we go  You ever have this one up? 
[04:35:00]  Uh, yes  It makes your  And it makes half your throat numb, too, right?  It almost  You can't swallow  Oh, it's awful  It's  Yeah, you have a hard time swallowing  By the way  Someone is suggesting  You might have Ben's cell phone  Caught in  Under that cap  I hear ya  All right, here we go  Let's listen in  I'm still numbing the thing out  With the Q-tip  Okay  Uh-huh  Is this numb enough  So it doesn't hurt  When you put the needle in, Doc?  Yeah  That's to disinfect, Anthony 
[04:35:30]  It says I'll be comfortable  But it's a little too late for that  Oh, I'm such a pussy  Excuse my language here, Doc  I'm not a potty mouth  Oh, God  You have XM satellite radio?  You do?  You ever listen to the Opie and Anthony show?  Oh, he does  Oh, my God  He knows who I am  I hope he's a fan  Oh, Jesus  Ask that Jew thief  Is he going to take your insurance?  Patrice, shut up  Yeah  Tell that Christ killer 
[04:36:00]  To put more stuff to number  Don't worry, Lab  Tell that cheap Jew  You're paying in cash  I'll put it down  Okay  Okay, here comes the needle  All right  Oh, God  All right, Doc  Be gentle  As a representative of Anthony's family 
[04:36:30]  I say we pull the plug  Now listen for a zipper  Why are we playing the Terry Schiavo audio?  Jesus  God, how much  What happened to Anthony?  How much did you put in there, Doc? 
[04:37:00]  Hopefully enough  Oh, I hope so  By the way, you just said what?  What?  Yes  Maybe I brush my teeth with Novocaine  No, that was actually a pretty painless needle that he did there  Oh, look at that  Jiggling  That's going to be a great endorsement for the fine dentist  Yeah, let me rinse  Did you hear that?  That was me rinsing  Is it drooling down your  Not yet  Drooling down your lip yet?  Oh, God, that one 
[04:37:30]  It's that one that they've got to give you  Way in the back of the jaw  That makes the whole  Oh, there goes the tip of my tongue  Okay  Oh, this is great  Do you want to buy a dryer door?  Dude, you've got  I've been drug-free 17 years  Oh, that is weird  Yeah  It's all going numb now  Anthony, you've got to do some Dudley Moore  Oh, yeah  We can talk about that, Doc  Yeah  Sure  Yeah  Roo canal got reinfected 
[04:38:00]  Three options  Oh, no  Here are the options  Try and redo the root canal, huh?  Uh-huh  If you look at the roof  Yeah  It goes all the way down here  Yeah, I see  It goes down very far  Yeah, yeah  If you look at the root canal building  It doesn't go all the way down to the end of the roof  Oh  They didn't take out the whole nerve  Right, Matt  It's a bad dentist  Uh-huh 
[04:38:30]  Oh, his body's trying to reject it  Nice  Take off the crown  Uh-oh  Drill back down through the root canal  Delicious  Try to do it again  Yeah  Is that what he would recommend?  Yeah  That's what he recommends?  Well, that's what we go for  I guess the other option is yanking the tooth out, huh?  The other option is actually surgically going down into the bone  Boom  And actually removing part of it  Why would we want to do that?  Remove part of the bone?  Oh, okay  But it's an option  It's an option  And the third is 
[04:39:00]  I wouldn't want to take you too bad  No, either  I kind of like it  Let me talk to Dr. Weinstein for a minute  Why can't you just get rid of the nerve?  Are you dissing my old dentist?  I just want to ask him that there's a black man questioning his authority here  It's a B cap  It's an A cap  A cap, that's a B cap  It's a B cap  Wow, the guy's dissing my old dentist  Who put the original cap in  That guy's working  He didn't take the nerve out, Anthony  Yeah, he didn't take the nerve out  And he didn't  It's a bad cap 
[04:39:30]  It doesn't go all the way over  Jesus  There's probably still gauze sticking out of it  The whole dentist stuck  Was your dentist named Tyrone?  Rooks now specialist  You don't do that, huh?  What can you do for me, like, now?  Aside from numbing my entire jaw  That's pretty much it  Can you write me a prescription for  Morphine?  Morphine, I love that stuff  No?  Oh, God, I'm talking like Voss  I swear  No, we can hear it 
[04:40:00]  All of a sudden I have  I'm three shades darker  And I'm smoking  Adjust the bite  So I'm not biting down on it so much  Now, before when you sit down on it  Uh-huh, yeah  Little Buddy Hinton's gonna come up to me  And go, baby talk, baby talk  It's a wonder you can walk  When it's time to change  All right  And should the antibiotic stock  You know 
[04:40:30]  It'll knock out the infection  But  Because when I stop  It'll just come back  If there's some  In the root  That was  That was Yiddish  By the way  Okay, Italian  I'm trying to make you my brother here  Help me out  Hey, Anthony  Is he gonna write you a prescription  For pain medication  When he's not controlling  The world's banks?  Jimmy, shut up  Okay  Well, Doc  I probably can't hold this  While you're doing this, right? 
[04:41:00]  Oh, I can  I'm trying to get off  On my own show  And he says it's fine  Wait, what is he gonna do  For you, Anthony?  He's gonna fix the crown  So I'm not biting down on it  So much  All right  Hey, can you do  Some Dudley Moore?  No, I'm not doing impressions  While I'm in the dentist chair  Yeah  But in the movie 10  Dudley Moore went to the dentist  And his whole face was numb  And  Yeah  And you do a good Dudley Moore  And I just  I got  I got 
[04:41:30]  Hold on  I just bit down on some carbon paper  Oh, that's to check the bite  Yeah  Here we go  Listen in  Oh, God  I hate that noise  Hey, Norton  Does that sound like piss?  Norton's getting turned on 
[04:42:00]  I sound like a young girl's bladder to me  Anthony, someone is saying  You're gonna sound like a trainable  In a few minutes  Uh-huh  All right  Here we go again  He's just smoothing down the bite  That's all he's doing  Yeah  I thought he might be drilling something  But  No, he's not helping you  What about the pain?  Hey, we gotta get this stock 
[04:42:30]  Home system  Hey, Anthony  What is he gonna do?  Does he have  Does he have Lavoris hooked up to a fire hose? 
[04:43:00]  God, Eric's gonna hate us  When he listens to the replay later on  He has no idea  He has no idea  He's checking the bite  I'm assuming  Nope  Oh  Yeah  He's going back in  Yeah  No pain 
[04:43:30]  This is great  Hey, Anthony  Yeah  The next time you talk to him  I want you to address him  Like Pesci addressed De Niro  In the desert in Casino  Wow, I am so numbed out  That rules  But when this  Goes up, Doc  It's really gonna hurt 
[04:44:00]  Oh  I took one of those needles home with me  Oh, he just blinded tooth  Yeah  What?  Yeah, with that little  Tooth sander  Yeah  No, it was the drill  Oh, that was a drill  Yep  Wow  So did he want to give you  Anything for the pain?  Like  Yeah  Keep you through?  Yeah  You got something for the pain, right?  They're all very concerned  About pain medication  I don't think for me, though  Yeah, Doc  Doc, I'm gonna need about 250 tablets  And to ask him how long 
[04:44:30]  You're gonna have to take care of this  When's the next time?  Yeah  What do I do about  Getting a root canal specialist?  Specialist  Yeah  You just told him  I'm not coming back to you  What can I do to get a good dentist?  No  No, you know how they do that  You go to one  And then you go to the specialist  No, not really  You stay with the guy  That's working on you  Yeah  He's right upstairs  There's no reason to go to a specialist  Mm-hmm  Well, should you say  In plain English 
[04:45:00]  Not a Jew?  Yeah  That's what specialist is  In my community  We're going to a specialist  Not a Jew  Hey, Anthony  Anthony  Yeah  Can you ask him why he said  What he said this month  In board reflections?  It's Dr. Goldberg  Hey, he's gonna need a boombox, by the way  Well, we'll give him whatever he wants  It's a little toothola  Nothing 
[04:45:30]  No, I really do feel like boss  Hey, if my prognosis joke bombed  Toothola's not getting anything  Where's Eric through this whole thing?  Yeah, just kind of standing behind me  Yeah  Yeah, Doc  You might want to check Eric out  They're saying he should have a look  Yeah, he's one of the producers 
[04:46:00]  And he had a little problem  A couple of months back  Where guys brought in some toothpaste  And mouthwash and stuff  So  They're thinking maybe he should be looked at  A little bit  You know what's gonna be funny?  When the crew comes in  The dentist's dressed like the Apollo 13 group  They are pounding you  Oh, what is it that? 
[04:46:30]  Is  Is Vicodin good?  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  Yeah, it's good stuff  You're getting thumbs up, Doc  Nice prescription  Keith from Indiana  On the phones  And it's gonna sound like  Daily Dooley  Daily Dooley  Of course  I really can't talk  This is  This is gonna be a very  Interesting last hour  Oh God  That's amazing  Is he just about done with you? 
[04:47:00]  This afternoon  I should go?  Hmm  I have an appointment  With another dentist  Perhaps I should go to her  And then she can send me  I'm gonna have to do that  Yeah  Well, you know something?  If I try to cancel my other appointments  You can bill me anyway  How much for this?  Really?  Yeah  How much is this costing you today?  I don't know  I don't care  I'm rich  Well, we wanna  We wanna know from him 
[04:47:30]  Just in case  You know  People  People  You know  Yeah, he just said  Not something you wanna say  Before I write out the bill  Oops  Hey, does this dentist  Seem like he knows  What he's doing?  Yeah  I'll go to him next time  He's right upstairs  I'm sick of going to Wiley  He's right upstairs  I recommend him now, Jimmy  You got bad teeth, Jimmy?  No  Actually, my dentist  Was amazed at how good my teeth are  She was smiling  Saying you have fantastic teeth  And great bone structure  Now, what does she say  About the problem with no lips?  Like, is it easy?  You want to open your mouth  Behind no lips? 
[04:48:00]  I'm coming back downstairs, gentlemen  All right, Anthony's coming back down  Couldn't you just let me  Enjoy my little victory  With  I have good teeth?  Open up  Oh, it's open  It's always open  This is Richard Dreyfuss  You're listening to  The worst of  Opie and Anthony  My dad  I wanted to go see  My bodyguard  And I forget  What black and white  Woody Allen film  He took me to  Which  I may enjoy now  That I'm 36  But, you know  Yeah, as a kid  Yeah, as soon as you can  Smell her breath  Thanks, Dad 
[04:48:30]  Smells like lollipops  She's three  Yeah, kids  Not really going  For the Woody Allen movies  I was not  It was a bad one  It might have been  Stardust Memories  If someone could correct me  I think that may have been it  Jesus  And it was so bad  I was so disappointed  My dad actually took me  To see like the second  Half of my bodyguard  At another theater  You sure it wasn't like  Zelig?  No, no, no  I think this was like  Way before Zelig  Oh, way before Zelig  Yeah, I was probably  13 or 14  Oh, all right  I  I went to go see 
[04:49:00]  Saturday Night Fever  In the theater  With my mom  And my grandmother  And I was sitting  Right between the two of them  Talk about the most  Embarrassing movie moment ever  When  What's her face there  Annette is getting  Gangbanged  In the backseat of that car  Oh, my God  You happy now?  You're a cunt  And I'm sitting there  And my grandma  Is right next to me  Whoa  I was sweating  I was sweating profusely

[04:50:00]  Why didn't you call me?  I don't know what's more embarrassing  That  Or the fact that I walked into the movie theater  With the same platform shoes  That lucid  I just fell off the bridge  Was wearing  Horrible  Keep me warm  In your love  Then you saw  Hey, Grandma  You ever get banged like that  At a bottle of tea? 
[04:50:30]  She comes out of the dancing place  With a condom in her hand  Just yearning for John Travolta's fog  Oh, yeah  Thanks  Well, I'd almost forgotten that moment in life  We belong to you and me  Na, na, na  It's really a nice place you have  You know that you're on high  Puerto Ricans  Take a picture  Wow

Oh, then you've got to hear that.  All right, well. 
[04:53:00]  And the funny thing is, sometimes you hear your friend say something, I had a similar problem.  Like when you said I'm sitting between my mother and my grandmother, I'm like, oh my God, I had the same problem.  Yeah.  Which finger do you smell first?  Oh.  We have a clip from what, Eric?  From Saturday Night Fever?  All right, Derek's got a clip for us, Anthony.  Come on, get away.  You're such a fucking cock teaser, you know that?

Yeah, that dialogue, and I'm sitting next to my grandmother.  That was awful.  Talking about cocks.  Oh.  Looking over.  Hey, Grandma.  Remember Grandpa's cock?  What do you say?  Horrible.  Did the guy who killed himself for that, whatever his name was, did he play Ralph Garcy in Fame?  Is that the same guy I'm thinking of?  Ah, same type. 
[04:54:00]  I'm not sure if it was him.  I know he was in the movie.  I don't know if it was the same guy.  You didn't even call me, Tony.  No, come on down from here.  Why did he kill himself?  I don't remember.  He didn't really kill himself.  He fell?  He kind of fell.  Yeah, he fell off the bridge.  Yeah, he was like, yeah, he was trying to be cool like the rest of the guys.  He was cool, and he was stoned and drunk or whatever.  Playing grab-ass with each other on the Verrazano Narrows Bridge and jumping around and doing handstands.  He was trying to be cool with his big platform shoes.  And he was like, Tony, I'm dancing. 
[04:54:30]  I'm dancing, Tony.  He fell off the bridge.  Yeah, he fell.  And it was real, a lot of sorrow there.  And Tony Manera gets over it in like 15 minutes.

All right, we've got to get to the Francine show.  The Francine show.  She wants to try to do a couple hours on this channel.  We're starting to do that, by the way.  Patrice is doing his relationship show again. 
[04:59:30]  Big hit.  This weekend, Saturday night from 8 to 10, Eastern Time.  Yeah.  And then I think we've got some other things in the works, definitely.  Mm-hmm.  But here's Francine, the Francine show.  A couple examples.  Yeah.  The first one is Francine gets knocked up.  Now, what the hell could this be about, aside from her being pregnant?  Danny?  Exactly.  Oh, Jesus.  Our own Francine was knocked up?  Yeah.  Yeah, I was surprised that she was so open about this stuff.  She is black.  All right, here we go. 
[05:00:00]  The Francine show.  And actually, Dan was in for this portion, so.  Oh, good.  He sat in.  Dan sits in.  Yeah.  You had an abortion, Francine?  Well, guess what, fellas?  I almost had to have an abortion.  All right.  Wait a second.  I almost had to.  Instead, you had a baby?  I was 17, and I had a boyfriend, and we were having sex without condoms.  Always smart. 
[05:00:30]  Yeah, not the greatest idea.  That's the voice of reason.  He didn't have any money, and neither did I have to buy any.  So we just did it without it.  So I got pregnant.  Congratulations, everybody.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  And I was really scared, and I was like, I don't really know what to do.  And this is terrible, but there was a flight of stairs.  No, no.  Here's the other problem, right?  I didn't really know if he was the dad, because I had also had sex with, like, another guy 
[05:01:00]  that month, right?  Wow.  But I believe he was only because they told me it was about three months that I was pregnant  when I went to the hospital.  He was the last guy I had.  It was between two guys.  So I figured out it was him.  Probably.  So.  I'm not the father.  So he was definitely the one that did it, right?  Plus, the other guy was like, I'm, like, infertile.  What's that mean?  I think, like, E-something, where you can't have kids. 
[05:01:30]  No, infertile.  Sterile.  Sterile.  So he told me, he was like.  E-fertile.  E-search website.  So I was at the dentist.  Do you think maybe that guy might have just said he was sterile, so he would never have  to deal with any responsibility with impregnating you?  Well, I don't think I would have had the baby in the first place.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to interrupt your story.  So, fellas, this is what happened.  Jesus.  I told my girlfriends.  I didn't tell my mom until, like, I think last year. 
[05:02:00]  I was like, chickies, listen to me.  Because I had three chickie friends.  Chickies.  I was like, I think I'm pregnant.  And the, like, chickies at the nursing place said I'm pregnant three months.  And I was like, I really can't have a baby.  I don't have any money.  So I figured they were like, we're all going to, like, pool together and give me some abortion  money, right?  Because I was like, I had no money.  And I was working.  It's $240 down at the free clinic. 
[05:02:30]  Fucking Damone gets her pregnant.  Oh, shit.  That was a great impression, man.  Thank you.  It's one of my favorites.  It's one of his best.  I love Damone.  That was a fucking great impression.  I love Damone, man.  Give him a little more.  I don't think he's heard this.  I thought we'd come by and help with your math homework on such a hot day. 
[05:03:00]  Isn't it great?  What is that accent?  What is that a mix of?  I don't know.  It's just kind of Damone.  It's just fucking Damone.  That is fucking great, man.  Shit.  He let us down on it.  No matter where you are, make it like that's the place to be.  Isn't this great?  I can make you happy at anything.  Dude, we had him on the show.  He let us down.  Kiss me.  He wasn't the fun Damone.  You won't regret it.  He why didn't do any of it?  He wasn't fun.  You're the assistant to the assistant manager of the movie theater. 
[05:03:30]  What is that?  Is that New York Jewish?  I don't know what it is, but it's great.  I love Damone.  Because I was like, I had no money, and I was working at Burger King, and I was like in  11th grade.  I'll put some money together and make over your uterus.  Get the scar tissue removed.  Yeah, and I had braces, so I was paying for my own braces at the time, so I was like, I 
[05:04:00]  have to pay.  How fucking hot is this?  I was just going to say that, Danny.  Because my teeth were atrocious, like I said before.  They were really bad.  So you worked at Burger King to raise the money for the...  Yeah, actually I did.  No, I didn't raise the money.  I was paying off like a $3,000 braces bill.  Wow.  Right.  Plus, I had to have oral surgery to move some teeth that were already inside my mouth.  My mouth was fucked up.  The guy could have just grabbed the baby while he was in there.  No, I wish I could have done that, but I'm at the dentist's office. 
[05:04:30]  I'm doing like a dental thingy, and I think it was a cleaning, not an orthopedic.  What?  Because that's for your teeth.  Oh, my God.  Poor bone.  Orthopedic.  I like felt blood coming out, so I was like, I wonder what this is.  Holy shit.  So I called my girlfriend.  This story gets funnier and funnier, Francie.  And she was like, I was like, listen, I got blood coming out my vagina, and I'm pregnant,  so this shouldn't be my period.  So she was like, well, I don't know what to do.  So what I did was I was like, well, maybe I'm having my period anyway. 
[05:05:00]  So I jammed a tampon up my crotch.  Oh, that's good.  Stop a little junior.  I called another chick.  Stopped up his brain.  And she was like, oh, my God, are you crazy?  Take that tampon out of your crotch and just go to the bathroom.  So I went to the bathroom, took out the tampon, and voila, all this red shit came out.  It was the baby.  It came out its own.  Give her a show. 
[05:05:30]  You were covering up so much pain with that.  I'm sorry.  The baby came out to the toilet.  Giving out cigars that say, it's a blob.  It was red shit.  It was nothing about big old pile of shit just came out.  And I was like, yay.  And the first thing she's like, she just goes, free abortion.  I was like, I don't need any money anymore.  This is great. 
[05:06:00]  This is great.  Holy.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus.  Let me look at my calendar.  Holy shit.  Are you kidding me?  That's the best thing I've ever heard.  That is the happiest miscarriage story I've ever heard.  Are you kidding me?  She didn't get a free abortion.  She had a fucking miscarriage.  That is the most honest fucking thing I've ever heard in my life.  That is unbelievable.  Think of how loved that child would have been had it lived. 
[05:06:30]  She's laughing about flushing.  Not even an ounce of sadness.  No.  It's like she just hit a $20 scratch ticket.  Yeah.  Yay.  Look, I would love to go to the next segment, but I have to address a few things with Francine.  Yeah, let's get Francine in here.  On this first segment.  Francine, get in here because holy shit.  She might have just got herself a couple hours on the channel.  New, and that is fantastic.  Hi, Francine.  How are you?  You're not pregnant, are you? 
[05:07:00]  Not this month.  Yeah.  Take a seat because then you're closer to the mic.  Oh, my God.  Get her on the pal-top camera.  Yeah, turn that around.  Get that off of Bob Kelly.  Not everyone can see how hot she is.  Get that off of Bob and turn the – you can just spin it.  Don't use the mechanical thing.  Yeah, here.  I'll do it.  Physically do it.  Yeah, physically turn it and get Francine on camera.  There she is.  You got it?  I don't know.  She's right there.  Good.  Francine, that is a very candid story.  Thank you. 
[05:07:30]  No one knew that.  It's a true story.  I don't doubt it's true.  It had too much – I don't think you could have made that up.  It was when you were 17.  Yeah.  You got pregnant.  Was it a white guy?  No.  Actually, back then I used to date black guys.  Black guys.  Yeah.  So he did you and then got you pregnant.  How old was he?  I think he was about 17, too.  About 17 also.  You find out you're pregnant because you skipped three periods.  Yep.  You said you were three months pregnant.  Yep.  So you skipped three periods. 
[05:08:00]  Three months along isn't like – usually abortion is like you miss your first period.  Girl goes and checks if she's pregnant.  If she is, she gets an abortion.  It's really nothing there.  You procrastinator.  The cell is pretty much, you know –  It's a little dot.  Yeah.  It's divided into a couple of pieces.  Not, you know – at three months, there's some arms and legs and shit going on.  You can't fit it into a Petri dish.  It's small.  At three months.  It's small, but it's starting to form, you know what I mean?  Looks like a gummy bear. 
[05:08:30]  Yeah, yeah, a little gummy bear.  So what made you wait three months?  Well, I had no money.  I really didn't.  Did you look into how much it was?  Yeah.  One of my friends had an abortion at 15, and she told me it was about 250.  About 250.  Yeah, and she told me it was really painful, so I didn't want to go through all that pain she was talking about.  Unlike childbirth, which is a joy.  Yeah.  Yeah, just let it ride.  What were you – what were you hoping for? 
[05:09:00]  Oh, my God.  I got to play that –  You know, what were you hoping would happen if you weren't going for the abortion because you couldn't afford it?  You were just going to have a kid?  Nah, I couldn't have one.  So what were you doing?  You didn't realize, even in your mind, that it would keep growing until it came out of you, a human being?  Well, I told my friends, and they told me they'd help me with the money.  After what?  I think probably –  Six more months?  No, but I was really confused, and I didn't know what to do. 
[05:09:30]  But why the joy?  I mean, let's get right into this.  Wow, okay.  I mean, I get it.  This happens all the time, and then teenagers and women all over the place are –  With your sex.  Are like, oh, my God, oh, my God, what am I going to do?  Do I have it?  Do I have the abortion?  Blah, blah, blah.  But why the joy?  That's the most shocking part of the entire story.  Because I didn't want it.  You didn't want it.  Nope.  But there was no sadness whatsoever that something was growing like you had –  Zero.  That's great.  Did you know anything about – 
[05:10:00]  That's such a great chick.  Did you know anything about your own body and biology and how that works, like the growing  of a baby and things, and that that was a miscarriage, and you did know this?  Yep, and I walked out with a smile.  Did you go to the hospital?  Nope.  See, after a miscarriage, any girls out there listening, I would implore you, you're supposed  to go to the hospital because the fact that you had a miscarriage means something was  amiss.  Yeah, you don't –  Something was wrong. 
[05:10:30]  You don't dry your vagina off on the hand dryer and call it a day.  You might want to go see a doctor.  Yeah, there we go.  And when you see a head come out of your vagina, you might want to go see somebody.  It's not your twin.  You looked into it, into the toilet?  Yep.  What did you see?  I saw red stuff.  Now, did you see anything that looked like little baby parts?  Did it get like a poker?  Guys, I didn't even look.  I just saw the red stuff and flushed.  Did it have an afro, a little baby afro? 
[05:11:00]  No.  Did it look like you?  I don't know.  Did it have like a gold chain and a medallion?  No.  A gold tooth.  No.  A gold tooth.  Let's go to Monty in Montana.  Monty.  Hey, Buckfest.  Anyway, man, that is the most fucked up story I've ever heard in my life.  Yeah, that is hardcore, man.  You are hardcore.  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, man, I had a gold tooth.  I would imagine there's people out there that almost drove off the road because they weren't  expecting that.  The laughter. 
[05:11:30]  Yeah, let's hear her reaction again to the memory.  I think I got it cut up pretty good here.  My vagina.  And I'm pregnant, so this shouldn't be my period.  So she was like, well, I don't know what to do.  So what I did was I was like, well, maybe I'm having my period anyway.  So I jammed a tampon up my crotch.  And I called another chick.  And she was like, oh, my God, are you crazy?  Take that tampon out of your crotch and just go to the bathroom.  So I went to the bathroom, took out the tampon, and voila, all this red shit came out. 
[05:12:00]  It was the baby.  Oh, my damn.  It came out on its own.  Oh, man.  They were covering up so much pain with that.  Oh, my God.  And the baby came out to the toilet.  That cheaper boy.  Giving out cigars that say it's a blob.  That's a way to go, man.  She's telling it like she's on Leno, telling him a story.  Like, Jay.  A story. 
[05:12:30]  And then the craft service guy fell.  And, oh, it was hysterical.  But we filmed.  We finished.  Make a promo out of that.  Oh, my God.  That is, yeah, promo material.  You know.  Can I?  Any other woman would have been at least a little bit like, hmm, this was like a part of me  and my baby, and you're laughing.  And there would have been some kind of emotion there.  Any other show wouldn't even air this.  That's what you're going to give you guys credit.  Oh, my God. 
[05:13:00]  And you're like, whoopee, yay, hooray for your miscarriage.  You can't fake a laugh like that.  I was ecstatic about it, guys.  All right.  Let's go to Chris in Philly.  Chris.  Hey, Tony Bagel.  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  What kind of show do you want to do, Francine?  I don't know.  I could just tell stories.  I got a million.  Story time with Francine?  Yeah.  We could do that.  Just end them all with, ta-da!  Or, happy new year.  Yeah, Chris, we got to work something out.  She's definitely impressed us today. 
[05:13:30]  Hey, Todd.  Danny and Nathaniel were great, too, man.  Yeah, definitely they were.  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  All right.  Yeah.  John in Utah.  John, what's up?  Yeah.  If you give her a show, Stan has got to co-host it.  To keep her on track.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's not a bad idea.  Stan and Danny should sit in.  All right.  We're going to work out something with Francine.  Give her a couple hours.  What the hell?  Let's go to Craig in Florida.  Craig?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, I was so disturbed by the story. 
[05:14:00]  I'm coming up the floor to the Turnpike.  I found myself doing 20 miles an hour on the shoulder just in disgust.  I couldn't believe that.  That was a surprise to everyone.  We had no idea because we didn't listen to this ahead of time.  Only Stan and Danny knew.  And they're like, trust us on this.  This is gold.  All right.  Let's go to Scott in Jersey.  Scott, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Fucking psychotic bitch.  Yeah, you guys got to give her a show on Planned Parenthood.  That's all I got to say.  All right.  Yeah, we got to figure out some kind of theme for your show, Francine. 
[05:14:30]  Now, we got a second track here called Francine Has Her First Lesbo Experience.  Is this worth playing after what we just heard?  This one is equally amusing, just in a different way.  I mean, that one was more just disgusting.  This one is more hot.  But equally entertaining.  Equally.  All right.  You want to play the second?  This is a little long, but she sets it up pretty well.  You want to hear this, Anthony?  It's a little long. 
[05:15:00]  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  That's it.  She shot up.  She stuck a tampon, shook her.  She jumped up and down like a champagne bottle, and then popped it out of her vagina.  Yay.  It did hurt for like 15 seconds.  My tummy hurt.  It did?  Aw.  And I took a Tylenol, and everything was okay.  I was going to say, did you take a Tums, and that was it, right? 
[05:15:30]  She took an acid reflux pill, a NXIVM.  All right.  You ready for the second story, Anthony?  Um, yeah.  You know what I'm thinking?  Because I'm always thinking radio.  We should have ended with the first story.  Yeah, we didn't know.  We didn't know.  Who knew that was that?  I just don't think that this is going to have the same pop as the first story.  No.  There's no way.  But we'll see.  Let's listen to more of Francine doing radio.  So, I was like, I don't see what the big deal is about eating snatch. 
[05:16:00]  You should just fucking eat it.  Now, here's what happened.  Years and years later, I think I was like 22, me and this chick were hanging out in the summertime.  Now we're talking.  Yeah, so the house is empty and stuff like that.  And, um, I think she kind of gave me, like, the weird, funky feeling that she wanted to do something.  Right?  Like, the way she was sitting and stuff like that.  And we were just really good friends.  And to this day, we're really good friends anyway.  Right? 
[05:16:30]  So, we're on the couch.  And I kind of, like, leaned over and just kissed her.  And she kissed me back.  Like, so, then, uh, she, she was like, well, you know, I think if we do this, we should do this right.  She's like, I think I should take a shower.  So, she goes into the shower and she takes a shower.  Right?  So, I was like, I've never done it before or anything.  And I was like, this is kind of weird.  But I guess I could go through with it. 
[05:17:00]  And plus, I think I was in one of those weird bipolar states for, like, a week.  Like, so, um, she comes out the shower.  And, um, we kissed again.  And when she was naked?  Or was she wearing a towel?  She was naked.  She came out of the shower naked.  And she has a really cutesy body.  Like, she's...  White girl?  Black girl?  She was black.  Good question.  And she was really cute.  She still is really cute.  This was in Maryland?  No, this is in New York.  Oh.  Okay, I'm not going to say where. 
[05:17:30]  So...  Uptown.  Oops.  Anyways.  So, I figured, I guess, I've seen enough porn to know what to do from here.  So, I, like, gently, like, touched her breasts and stuff.  And I tasted it.  It was, uh, it was interesting and stuff like that.  But she is, like, a go-getter.  She, like, puts me on the toilet seat, like, where the cover is. 
[05:18:00]  Like, she puts down the cover.  Yeah.  And she goes straight to the box.  Nice.  She starts to eat me out, right?  So, I'm sitting there, like, wow.  I guess this is good.  Unless she gets her mouth full of baby.  It's not going to top the next, the last story, I'll be.  For some odd reason, I'm like, I'm not really, like, I was like, uh, I guess it's nice or whatever.  So, then, uh, we went back to the bedroom after the snatch eating session in the bathroom.  Were you making a lot of noise?  Who, me?  Yeah. 
[05:18:30]  Yeah, but it was, uh, it was okay.  Like, I wasn't fake.  She didn't do it good enough for you?  She did it good, but I think.  It was fake?  Here's what I think it was.  I think she was a little bit more into it than I was.  It's almost like you were getting molested or something like that.  Uh, kind of, sort of.  So, so we went back to the bedroom and we made out some more and she ate my snatch some more.  And then she was like, aren't you going to do me?  And so I'm on the bed, like, I had already jammed my finger up her crotch and, like, did all the ooey-gooey messy stuff. 
[05:19:00]  And I didn't really think I wanted to put my face down there, right?  Well, what was the problem with her box, though?  Looks like a wallet.  All right, uh, it's just that I'm used to jerking off a guy and here I am playing with a twat.  I mean, you have one.  It's not like you don't know what to do with it.  You know it feels good on you.  Yeah, but it was a little odd.  It was the first time and I was like, I didn't really know.  First time, that means it's happened.  No, no, no, no, no. 
[05:19:30]  It was the only, actually, first and only.  Is Danny, uh, saying that he'd suck a good cock?  No.  Uh, using the logic, using the logic you just used.  He had to think about that for a second.  Well, yeah, well, then in that case.  I would, maybe.  I would suck a fantastic one.  Just had to kind of bring that up.  Maybe Danny should have a show.  Right after Patrice.  We all missed the line, by the way.  Uh, Chester's liver had it from whackbag.com.  She skipped three periods. 
[05:20:00]  English, math, and science.  I must be pregnant.  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you.  Danny.  All right.  Show me with your mouth.  Back to Francine's story.  It's happened.  No, no, no, no, no.  The first time.  Actually, first and only time it ever happened.  Um, so, um, I was like, I was thinking in my head, like, I don't really want to go down  there.  Like, this is not my cup of tea. 
[05:20:30]  I, I like it that she does it to me, and she's, like, staying on my snatch for, like,  hours.  But I, I don't really think I want to reciprocate.  So, finally, I give in, and I'm like, ugh.  So, I kept asking, so I was like, I guess I'll fucking eat the snatch.  But I was like, there's no way I'm going to eat it just like that.  I was like, hold on, I got to get saran wrap.  And hot sauce.  Oh, my God.  I, I couldn't do it.  It was too ooey and gooey in my fingers. 
[05:21:00]  So, what did you do with saran wrap?  So, I put the saran wrap over her vagina.  What?  What the?  This is fantastic.  All right, let's hold you.  You fucking put saran wrap.  Oh, do you know how insulting that is?  All right.  That you had to wrap it up like it was trout?  All right, this is what's going to happen, Francine.  It's going to be story time with Francine.  I hope his brain is going right now.  Oh, without a doubt. 
[05:21:30]  You, you give us a list of stories you want to tell.  And when, when we feel comfortable that you have enough stories to tell, you have two hours  on 202, baby.  Because this is, uh, fantastical.  Dan and Danny will be sitting in to keep you on track.  Yeah.  Because they did a great job as well.  Can I give a tease?  I raped myself with a dildo once.  Ooh.  Is this chick?  I've never, I've never met her in my life.  What the?  She's normal, right?  Yeah.  Like, she's not like, like off the street or nothing? 
[05:22:00]  See?  Uh, no.  See, this is the problem now.  That's like radio gold.  So now you're going to probably have to tell that story in a few minutes here.  I know.  After we finish with the, uh, the, the, this story.  I love her.  I did this story.  I don't know.  What?  And I, I didn't do that.  So.  What the?  God.  Oh, my.  Was this after the abortion thing?  Yeah, I was 22.  You just so, you know, you're just all safe and. 
[05:22:30]  But here's, no, no.  Here's no, no.  No, no.  We've known each other for a really long time.  And I know she's like a health fanatic.  And she was fine with this.  Yeah.  I mean, you, what, you said to her, I'm going to go get some saran wrap.  Yep.  And she was like, okay.  Yeah, she's like, she didn't really want me to.  But I was like, I'm not going to.  Here's the thing.  I, I jammed my fucking fingers up her crotch.  And it's like ooey gooey messy.  And.  And delicious.  No.  All right.  This is the other thing too.  Although, like, I had a lot of sex in like my teenage years, right? 
[05:23:00]  Like after, after like 18 or 19, I practically stopped having sex, right?  Like I hardly ever, I just do like maybe once every six months to a year, I'll have sex.  Since I was like around nine, probably 19 years old, right?  So my snatch is like always tight and small and stuff like that.  And it hurts.  She has a boyfriend. 
[05:23:30]  And I think this guy just goes at it like every day.  So her snatch is a little bit different from mine.  Mine's just the way it's supposed to be, which is what I think it is.  Tight snatch.  And I think hers was a little, you know.  Loosey goosey.  Loosey goosey.  And I didn't like the loosey goosey with the hairy hairy and all the ooey gooey.  It sucked.  It had flaps.  And when I went down there with the fucking saran wrap, right?  I was like, ew.  I was like, I feel for men. 
[05:24:00]  Open sesame.  I was like, I've got saran wrap and I don't fucking like it.  So it must be an atrocity for most men to fucking get down there and be like, oh God, I don't know what's going to be down there.  And then you get, I didn't like it.  I was like, this just stinks.  Fucking right.  I never did it.  I don't even count it really.  I'm like, eh.  So I didn't do it.  But I did rub her ass. 
[05:24:30]  She had a lovely round ass.  The way you're moving your hand, you twirled it.  Just rubbed it.  You buffed it.  Yeah.  Wax on, wax off.  Because I'm still on this whole saran wrap situation.  Who's, by the way, who's third guy in there?  One of her friends.  Gotta go.  Yeah.  Cannot be part of it.  Yeah, he will not be part of the story time with Francine radio show.  Mr. Wants Attention guy.  It's not about him.  That's right.  It's about Francine.  You're right, Anthony. 
[05:25:00]  Don't want to hear this guy trying to put in his little hack jokes.  Yeah, well, actually, Francine told me that he's a comic.  What?  Yeah, he's a lot more talkative on stage.  Well, you know, let him be talkative on stage.  Right.  Because he's trying to make a gag every time you say something.  He doesn't have to constantly be talking with every word you say.  Jesus Christ.  Here's the end of the story.  You took a piece of saran wrap.  Yes.  How big of a piece?  Was it just enough to cover, or was it like thigh to thigh? 
[05:25:30]  Good question.  It was probably about this big, so it was probably enough to go thigh to thigh.  Because I'm telling you, the way I was feeling it, I was like, there's no way my mouth is going down there.  Fuck it.  And I don't care what she says or what she does.  I don't want to do it.  I think this is, it's a good idea because I wanted the experience of being with a chick.  And it was nice, and I was in my weird little state.  And I think it was a good experience, but I'll probably never do it again. 
[05:26:00]  There it is.  Wow.  That is amazing.  Can I tell another addition to that story?  Okay.  After that incident, she actually came over to my house when my mom was away, and she  brought her boyfriend, because she kind of, I tell you, she's really, really into this  thing.  So she was like, my boyfriend wants to see us fuck.  So I was like, didn't she just get it?  I don't want to do this anymore. 
[05:26:30]  Yeah, I brought out saran wrap for God's sake.  Did you put a hint?  A Ziploc on his cock?  And her boyfriend, he was all right.  So I went to the bathroom.  I came back to the living room, and they were fucking in my living room.  The nerve.  Jeez.  Right in your living room.  Right in the living room.  And what did you do?  I was like, can you guys take that to the bedroom?  So they went to the bedroom.  They were probably thinking, yeah, we're all going to the bedroom.  So they went to the bedroom, and I stayed in the living room, because I didn't want to 
[05:27:00]  join, and I watched TV, and I called my boyfriend, and she came out in the living room in her  towel, and she was like, aren't you going to join us?  And I was like, no.  So she had to go back.  Oh, wow.  That must have been an awkward thing.  That's a little awkward.  Is she coming?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe she's out of saran wrap.  Go to the store.  Maybe she went to White Hen.  That's all you have is like a blue team over the pool. 
[05:27:30]  You guys, we might have the line of the show from Adam in Nebraska.  We're trying to find a name for Francine's radio show that she's going to do soon on 202.  Adam.  What's up?  I got one.  All right.  Tissue time from the hood.  Yeah, tissue time.  Human tissue.  Everybody likes whacking off to a good miscarriage.  Miscarriage with braces.  Thank you.  Yeah, just a picture of you, all young, with your braces on, miscarrying into a toilet bowl. 
[05:28:00]  But cackling.  And laughing about it.  And flushing.  And flushing it down.  Bye-bye, Junior.  Boy or girl, did you look?  Was there a little peeny floating in the mess?  It was just red stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like liver.  Where's the CD?  Jesus.  Oh, God.  You know, this is crazy, but we're going to play it a third time.  This is disgusting.  Got to hear her description.  She said a liver came out of my vagina.  This is so perfect. 
[05:28:30]  It's not the whole story.  It's the last minute.  Pretty much right before the big punch line.  Can we, uh...  Can we...  Let me see if I can find it.  Yeah.  Can we play this real low in the background?  Yeah, of course.  Turn this down a little so it's low.  Happy music.  All right, ready?  Yeah.  We'll go to break with this once again.  It really gets funnier and funnier, Fritz.  And she was like...  I was like, listen, I got blood coming out my vagina. 
[05:29:00]  And I'm pregnant, so this shouldn't be my period.  So she was like, well, I don't know what to do.  So what I did was I was like, well, maybe I'm having my period anyway.  So I jammed a tampon up my crotch.  And I called another chick.  And she was like, oh, my God, are you crazy?  Take that tampon out of your crotch and just go to the bathroom.  So I went to the bathroom, took out the tampon, and voila, all this red shit came out.  It was the baby. 
[05:29:30]  Oh, my God.  It came out on its own.  Oh, man.  You were covering up so much pain with that.  Oh, my God.  The baby came out to the toilet.  I jammed a boy.  Giving out cigars that say it's a blob.  Let's go to Bo in Jersey.  Bo, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  While Francine was doing this story, my mom was on the phone with me. 
[05:30:00]  And she overheard the whole thing.  And she laughed harder than Francine did at the story.  I thought it was funny as hell.  Only child, are you?  No one saw that coming.  That's the beauty of that one.  Ty in Texas, what's up?  Hey, I have an idea for Fran's show.  Okay.  It should be Fran, Than, and Dan's show.  Fran, Than, and Than.  That's fantastic.  No, Than wants it to be Fran, Than, and Dan.  Yeah. 
[05:30:30]  What do you want that from?  Fran, Than, and Dan's show.  Cody in Indiana.  Cody.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Another idea for the show that hopefully doesn't stink.  Big Bloody Mess is the name of the show.  And other bedtime stories with Francine.  Big Bloody Mess and other bedtime stories.  Well, as soon as Francine has a list of stories that we think will be good.  I would flush it if you got them.  It'll be story time with Francine.  Nothing.  Nothing.  All right.  And someone is suggesting after each one of her stories, she yells out, 
[05:31:00]  The Aristocrats.  Yeah.  That's Don from Jersey.  Don Catlow.  Very good.  Good idea.  Should, uh, we're running out of show.  How long is the, uh, the, that story you teased?  The dildo thing.  The dildo story's not that long.  All right.  Why don't you tell us a little bit about the dildo story?  Yeah, but you know what I'm thinking?  What?  What if she does it live at the Hard Rock tomorrow in front of an audience?  Oh, gosh.  Hey, that'd be nice.  Could you pull that off, you think, or no?  Be honest.  Oh, honestly, like, um, really, I actually have, like, a job job. 
[05:31:30]  Oh, you can't be there, Mom?  Yeah.  All right.  Tell the story now, then.  Damn it.  Sorry, I would come, though.  I really would.  Yeah.  All right.  Tell the story, then.  All right.  What happened with the, uh, dildo?  Well, here's the dildo story.  Uh, I hadn't had sex to have-  Wait, what's the title of the story?  Uh, Really Desperate.  Really Desperate.  Okay.  Signed, Really Desperate.  What is it, what is this, what is it about?  You said, what it was about again?  Can you tell me?  Well, I had-  The dildo story.  You raped yourself with a dildo?  I raped myself with a dildo.  All right. 
[05:32:00]  That's it.  Uh, it was about a year and a half since I had had sex, and I asked one of my girlfriends  what I should do, because I really wanted to do it.  She was like, well, you know, why don't you get a dildo?  So I was like, oh, that sounds good.  So I went down to the dildo store.  The dildo store.  There's a dildo store?  Yeah.  Where is that?  Do you have music for that?  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  Dildos are us.  Dildos are us.  Dildos are us.  Babes are us, I think. 
[05:32:30]  Babes are us?  I think so.  Sex toys are us.  Yeah, yeah.  Just walking down to the dildo store.  Just had an abortion.  I'm going to go beat myself up with a sword-handed dildo.  Yeah.  You went to the dildo store.  And I went dildo shopping.  Now, how was that?  How did you choose?  What was the criteria for the dildo?  Criteria for the dildo is big and thick.  That's pretty much it.  You wanted it big and thick.  Well, at least normal size big and thick.  And what color?  Well, I got a clear one, to tell you the truth. 
[05:33:00]  Clear?  Yeah.  Oh, that's awful.  I got a clear dildo.  So you wanted to have sex with a ghost?  No, not that I wanted to have sex.  You can see the little hand and the little leg attached to the dildo.  Well, it's like getting a black car in a nothing.  Okay, good.  Were there any people in the store?  There was a lot of people in the store, actually.  Really?  Shopping?  Yeah, they were all dildo shopping.  More guys or girls or a mix?  It was more girls than guys.  Wow.  And there were books and videos.  All kinds of fun stuff.  And behind-the-counter guy or girl? 
[05:33:30]  Chicks.  They all look like lesbians.  Yeah, they are.  And then so you picked it out.  Saran wrap on their vaginas?  Is that how you knew?  Do they have saran wrap on their vaginas?  Is that how you knew they were lesbians?  No.  Saran wrap.  So you bought your dildo?  No, no.  First, I had to pick a size of the dildo.  So I looked at all the dildos on the table, and the lady told me, she's like, if you've  never used the dildo, you should probably take this one as a starter.  And it was probably about, let's say, four or five inches.  And I looked at it and said, eh, I think I could do a little bigger. 
[05:34:00]  Yeah.  Man up.  I bought a, yeah, that's right, Anthony.  I manned up.  And I got this probably about seven or eight inch dildo.  It was probably about three or four inches thick.  And I thought it was perfect.  All right.  So I got the batteries.  Did you say four inches thick?  Like.  I don't know.  What is that?  Four inches is this big, sweetie.  Oh, that's really big.  Well, in diameter.  Maybe circumference.  Yeah, then you got to make a circle out of it, Bob.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm not. 
[05:34:30]  Okay.  Thanks, Hope.  You made it sound like it was four inches across.  Yeah, like a square.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Put this in your vagina.  Make a perfect fucking circle, you ass.  Makes it a little smaller.  It's like an IQ test.  It doesn't fit.  Jesus.  You have a round hole.  All right.  Let's go.  We're running out of show.  So you got the dildo.  Yeah.  So I got the dildo, and I got the batteries, and I took it home with me.  And the lady had given me like these little cream thingies to make it easier for the. 
[05:35:00]  Lubrication.  Yeah.  Penetration.  Yeah.  Right.  Lubrication stuff.  So I got home.  How did you set the mood or set up your room or yourself?  What did you do?  Well, I put on classical music.  Uh-huh.  Why classical music?  A little classical music.  What classical music do you know or have?  Well, actually, besides you guys, I listen to you guys all day and all night.  When I go to sleep, actually, I put on, I think it's that station with a lot of news 
[05:35:30]  in the morning.  All right.  And then at night, it turns into-  Classical.  Yeah.  Really?  It's that awful station, NPR.  There you go.  Oh, okay.  National Public Radio.  All right.  So you got the classical music cracking.  Classical music is playing.  Yeah.  You got the dildo by your side.  Yeah.  And I thought I was ready for this dildo.  I didn't think it was too small or too big or anything.  Now, you unwrapped the whole thing and then you're kind of, you took all your clothes off.  Yep.  So you're naked. 
[05:36:00]  You're nude, laying on your bed.  Yes.  Now, are you getting a little excited at the prospect?  Actually, I was very excited.  I hadn't had sex in like a year and a half.  I was really looking forward to this.  Yeah.  So I took the lubrication and I rubbed it out around my vagina.  Yeah.  Because I thought that's what you should do.  Sure.  And I took the dildo and I tried to jam it out my crotch.  Huh.  Yeah.  Tried to jam it out my crotch.  It would not go in. 
[05:36:30]  Why?  Because it was too big.  Yeah.  Well, and she hadn't had sex in a year and a half.  So her vagina gets shrunk.  Exactly, sure.  The vagina gets shrunk enormously.  Was it jamming from lack of lubrication or just pure size difference?  Pure size difference.  You couldn't stretch?  It wasn't stretching, not very well at least.  Gee.  You should have got a hammer.  Knock it in.  Take a few whacks at it with a lump hammer.  Or a mallet from that.  Like a cartoon. 
[05:37:00]  Thump, thump, thump.  A mallet from, what is it called?  Lawn bowling, whatever.  The mallet game.  Croquet.  Croquet.  A little croquet.  Okay.  I wish.  Yeah.  So you try it now.  You're a little disappointed?  Well, but I'm not going to give up because I refuse not to have sex in that mall.  Very good.  I should at least have a fake penis go inside.  Okay.  So I slowly but surely try to jam this penis clear thing up my crotch. 
[05:37:30]  And it's hurting a little bit.  And it's hurting a lot, actually, because it's not really going in properly.  Were your eyes actually pushing out of your head?  Yeah.  It was actually, yeah, it was painful.  So I laid there in my bed and I was feeling a little down about it.  Yeah.  And slowly but surely I got it in.  But by the time I got it in, I felt like I was taking advantage of myself.  And it was vibrating at the same time because it was one of those vibrating dildos.  Right.  So I got this noise going, the vibrating noise, and it's hurting. 
[05:38:00]  So that's how I rate myself with a dildo.  Oh, because it was a lot of pain.  Were you bleeding or chafed afterwards?  No, I wasn't bleeding afterwards, but I did feel like taking advantage of.  See, I thought it was going to end with her not being able to get it up there, so she  rolled over and jammed it up her ass.  So you took advantage of yourself?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You felt like you would rape yourself because it was so uncomfortable.  Did you have a dull blade on your own neck when you were doing this?  Did I what? 
[05:38:30]  Nothing.  Did you steal your ATM card and take out some money later?  No, I didn't.  But I did do it like, I probably did it for about three months.  I raped myself because I refused to give up.  Good girl.  Yeah.  So I raped myself probably about once or twice a week for three months.  And then I threw it away because I realized it was just too much.  Hurting your kidneys?  All right.  Let's hear it for Francine.  Thank you.  Francine, wonderful.  It gave us a hell of an hour.

Don't let her taunts intimidate you.  I'm book smart.  What kind of book?  I just read a lot of Christian novels.  God.  If you have the slightest ability to retain information, you'll win.  I did really bad in high school.  Away with you.  Away.  Away.  Leave.  Anyone can win at this game.  Right, Francine?

[05:43:00]  If you purchased an energy-efficient air conditioner or storm doors in 2006, or plan to make your home more energy-efficient in 2007, you may qualify for a tax credit.  I'm Brigitte Yule with the Bankrate.com Personal Finance Minute.  The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provided tax credits for consumers who invest in many types of home improvements.  These include adding insulation, replacing windows and doors, air conditioning systems, and water heaters. 
[05:43:30]  Unlike a deduction which reduces the amount of income subject to tax, a tax credit directly reduces the tax itself.  The tax credits for home improvements are capped at $500 per homeowner.  Not every product with the Energy Star label qualifies.  The website EnergyStar.gov does an excellent job of explaining what improvements qualify for the credit and how much the credit will be.  And it's all in the language the layman can understand.  For more tips and personal finance topics, visit Bankrate.com. 
[05:44:00]  I'm Brigitte Yule.  It's the worst.  Anthony.  Well, I did enjoy the Mets game yesterday.  But I have to ask the audience.  I have to ask Anthony and whoever else wants to listen.  I have a funnier gay.  A gangbang from the entire Mets team.  No, because that would be gay.  Well, I decided to pick up marshmallows in front of the entire Mets team.  I thought it would be funny.  They yelled gay.  No.  You're a man taking on the entire team. 
[05:44:30]  It's gay.  I had great box seats right off first base.  And then Mark Turnoff comes down to see how the seats are and stuff.  And we're chatting.  We're chit-chatting.  A little chit-chat.  And then he's like, you want to go up to one of the suites?  You know, they have a suite at Shea Stadium as well that they give to clients.  I'm like, yeah, let's check out the game from up above now because we sat in the box seats for about six innings.  I'm like, yeah, let's go check it out.  You know, and they have food and beer up there, right?  So I get out of my seats.  I'm way down close to the field. 
[05:45:00]  So I have to walk up, and then I have to walk to my right to the exit.  It's a long walk in front of a ton of Mets fans, a ton of Mets fans, and, quite frankly, a lot of O&A fans.  Yell on Opie and, you know, blah, blah, blah.  Where's Anthony?  All that, right?  So I'm with Lindsey, and I'm with Danny.  Danny goes to the game.  So I turn as I'm starting my walk.  I turn, and I grab Lindsey's hand, right?  Yeah.  And we start walking, and now it's getting, you know, very tight. 
[05:45:30]  So she's behind me, but I have her hand.  So then I reach back lovingly, and I grab her other hand.  You know how you do that, right?  You do the two-hand grab from behind you.  The two-hand grab from behind.  And now I'm walking with what I think is Lindsey's hands.  Yeah.  And I'm walking through the crowd, right?  And then she lets go.  So now I'm only holding one of her hands.  Right.  And I'm really into it.  You know, I had a really good day, and I'm, like, just holding her hand and walking us out of the place so we could go up into the suite. 
[05:46:00]  Yep.  Just as I get to the, what is it called, the exit or whatever, and now no one sees you anymore, I turn because now I could, like, you know, kind of pull her, you know, to my side.  Yep.  And that's when I find out it was Danny!  You had been holding Danny's hand?  Through the crowd!  I walked through the crowd.  Oh, my God.  How embarrassing.  They set me up so bad. 
[05:46:30]  They set me up so effing bad.  Bravo, Danny.  Thank you.  So what happened was...  Wow, that is embarrassing as all hell.  So what happened was when I turned and grabbed Lindsay's hand, I had Lindsay's hand.  Yeah.  And now I'm turning around and I'm walking us out, and she's behind me.  You go for the double hold.  When I go for the double hold, it's not Lindsay's second hand.  Danny grabs on at that point.  So for a little while, I was holding Lindsay's hand and Danny's hand.  Lindsay, who has a great sense of humor, realizes what's going on here and lets go. 
[05:47:00]  Let go, man.  And now I'm really feeling the moment, like, oh, this is a little thing.  Was he taking his thumb and kind of rubbing your hand, Danny?  I don't think I was.  If I was doing it, I was doing it subconsciously.  So now I'm holding Danny's hand through the entire, not the entire crowd, but the entire section.  Do you know what people must have thought that no you...  I'm praying no one took a picture.  And they're looking going, why is he holding that man's hand and walking him upstairs?  And it was like, oh, my God, that is so funny and gay. 
[05:47:30]  So, and then the laughter, it was just unbelievable.  Unbelievable when I turn around, like, you've got to be kidding me.  And I'm like, I didn't even notice, like, your calloused hand?  Yeah.  Come on, dude.  I didn't even notice?  So, and then on the way home, Danny brought up a little something, and he's completely right.  We had an awkward home run high five.  Okay.  Can we just delete that from any recording of this show? 
[05:48:00]  Stop it.  You didn't high five.  I was really into being there because I haven't been to a Mets game in a few seasons now.  A big fan I am, I know.  But I haven't been to a game.  Oh, my God.  I was too busy traveling around America when we weren't.  And since, you know, going back to radio 18, 19 months ago for XM first, I just haven't had time.  Up top, Danny.  Yeah.  Up top, Big D.  So it happened. 
[05:48:30]  It happened, and I thought nothing of it.  But on the way home, he had acknowledged, you know, we had an awkward high five home run moment.  High fiving someone during the home run moment is gayer than holding his hand for the walk to the box.  Well, I'll tell you what happened.  Who hit the?  Who hit the?  I think it was Reyes.  Yeah, yeah.  Unless it was Danny, you shouldn't have high fived.  I'll tell you what happened.  We're in the box seats, though.  And home run, right?  Everyone jumps up, and I realize I'm a pretty good sports fan. 
[05:49:00]  When I get into my team, you should see me at the Islander games.  I go nuts, right?  And so the home run is hit, and now I jump up, and now I'm looking around.  Uh-oh.  Usually I'm with a family member or something.  I don't care.  I know I could yell no homo, and everything's cool, right?  So I turn to my right, and it's a box filled with O&A fans.  I'm like, I'm not high fiving these guys.  No.  So then I turn to my left, and Lindsey's still sitting on her hands because she's a Phillies fan.  So she's not getting up. 
[05:49:30]  Yeah.  So then I turn around because now I'm up.  It's awkward.  Oh, my God.  You're looking around for the high-fiving person.  It's kind of like when you go to church, and you have to do the sign of peace, and you look around awkwardly.  Turn to your neighbor.  You look around awkwardly.  You've got to shake someone's hand.  Peace be with you.  Right.  Peace be with you.  So then I turn around, and it's Danny.  Were you up?  I think you were up.  He was up because he's a big Mets fan, too.  So I look at him.  He looks at me.  I'm like, ah, what the hell?  I didn't even actually think it out. 
[05:50:00]  But after the fact, I now realize it was just a bad move.  Oh.  And we high-fived.  Well, all right.  Slow down.  Did you miss?  Did you catch the side of each other's hands and make it like a half-assed high-five, which is the worst ever?  The best is that it's not like we both made eyes and was like, yeah, you know, and we both went up at the same time.  He's just, like, standing up with his hand out.  Oh, no.  Like, someone please high-five me.  So I'm like, all right, now I have to do this because I can't just leave the boss man hanging. 
[05:50:30]  Oh, no.  I'm like, this is awkward, isn't it?  It was like an episode of The Office where the boss takes you to the game.  Come on, up top.  Come on, one up top.  We're here enjoying the game.  You want a hot dog?  Some people are calling it Opie's Brokeback Baseball.  Well, there you have it.  Home run, home run.  Danny, hold me.  Oh, are they hammering you?  So then Danny's like, yeah, you know, we did have that awkward home run high-fived there in the game. 
[05:51:00]  I'm like, yeah, I guess.  Because it's not like me and the Opster are hanging out every Friday night, going to club.  Going clubbing and everything.  So that was as comfortable as it was going to get.  Hot dogs, hot dogs, peanuts, peanuts, get your peanuts.  Bikini teenies, bikini.  All right.  Two bikini teenies.  All right.  All right.  Come on, up top.  All right.  I love that.  When you get the high two, it's like you miss and only two of your fingers make contact with the other guy. 
[05:51:30]  The slip, it doesn't make that snapping noise.  It's too bad we got to take a break.  Oh, how awkward.  It's too bad we have to take a break.  Yeah.  It's a shame.  Well, it's too bad because the phones are just going nuts right now.  Jim in Albany, what's up?  Hey, Opie, is Danny's hands as soft as Lindsay's?  I know.  How you mistake Lindsay's like, Lindsay's got like elegant hands and those mitts that you can only call like mitts. 
[05:52:00]  What are you, Italian?  What are you?  Actually, like European, like Russian Jew.  Russian Jew.  You got a little bit of everything.  Those working mitts.  See, the Jew part gives them soft hands.  Let's be honest.  Is that what it is?  Let's be honest.  From cutting money all your life, Mr. Hooper.  Let's be honest.  No, they did the old switch.  So psychologically, I'm thinking I'm holding both of Lindsay's hands.  Yeah.  You can see it my way, right, Ant?  Not at all. 
[05:52:30]  What's wrong with Lindsay's right hand?  This is, ooh, going to have to get her some lotion.  Let's go to Charlie in Philly.  Charlie.  Let's go to bricklayer hands.  Charlie, make it fast.  Opie and Anthony, how are you guys doing this morning?  Good, man.  All right, Charlie.  Hey, I got to say it's both because day is funny.  Hey, after the half a high five, did you guys smack each other on the tush, too?  All right, all right.  Did you give each other a little pat on the ass?  Look, I call no homo.  Simple as that.  Yeah, you got to. 
[05:53:00]  Song about the truth.  I wrote it about a lady I was seeing not too long ago.  Hopefully I'll remember the lyrics sometime.  Have a seat and listen.  Please don't say a thing.  In matters of the heart sometimes the truth will ever sting.  Just don't take it personally.  This is no attack.  But we will never last because I'm white and you are also white. 
[05:53:30]  I only like black girls, the brown girls, the cafe au lait.  The caramel girls and mocha girls just blow me away.  If you are newbie and I want you to be in every fantasy.  But if you're a whitey, say nighty-nighty, you're just not the girl for me.  Well, her hair has to turn on, curvaceous front and back. 
[05:54:00]  Her hair is quite literally an aphrodisiac.  Don't call it jungle fever, cause that just isn't right.  I am not a racist.  Some of my best friends are white.  I just prefer black girls, the brown girls, the cafe au lait.  The caramel girls and mocha girls just blow me away.  Well, if you're a cracker, you better get blacker or else you best get out.  But it is no mystery.  I like a sister.  See, that's what I'm talking about. 
[05:54:30]  Oh, man.  I hate vanilla ice cream.  White rice is so bland.  The milk chocolate melts in your mouth, not in your hand.  But color is not the issue here.  It's dignity.  It's class.  It's all about her heart.  Okay, it's partly about that ass.  I want me some black girls, the brown girls, the cafe au lait.  The caramel girls and mocha girls just blow me away. 
[05:55:00]  Well, if you're a honky, you're singing the wrong key.  It's the honest truth.  The skin that she's dwelling in must contain melanin.  That is the fountain of you.  Thomas Jefferson.  Robert De Niro.  Well, strong thermal.  Strong thermal. 
[05:55:30]  Yeah.  Nice.  Yes.  Thank you.  This concludes the worst of Opie and Anthony. </pre>
