<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast centered heavily on the 2009 inauguration of Barack Obama, with a running commentary interwoven with other segments and caller discussions. Opie started the show with a hoarse voice, joking about using his illness as an excuse to avoid controversy.  They recounted a previous interview with Fedor Emelianenko, describing the MMA fighter as terrifyingly quiet, contrasting him with other more vocal fighters like Chuck Liddell and Tito Ortiz (who was a later guest).  They humorously detailed the communication challenges using a Russian translator.  The hosts also discussed a news story about a naked, intoxicated man found sleeping on an elderly woman's couch and speculated on Dick Cheney's wheelchair use.  A significant portion featured audio from a “hip-hop bus” traveling to the inauguration, playing interviews with enthusiastic passengers sharing their hopes for Obama's presidency.

Listener calls followed, covering reactions to the inauguration, the US Airways Flight 1549 water landing, airline luggage compensation, school name changes honoring Obama, and a movie theater stabbing.  Jimmy, a frequent contributor, shared a self-deprecating story about a breakup linked to his weight.  Caller discussions about the inauguration included Dan the Trucker describing massive traffic jams.  The hosts read and reacted (with varying degrees of amusement and cynicism) to children's letters to President Obama.  They also played and mocked George W. Bush's "Bushisms."  Callers offered diverse opinions on Obama’s presidency, often expressing views on race relations and the economy, sometimes using offensive language. One caller recounted a physical assault.  Rob, a caller, mentioned a misattributed Jay-Z quote.  An on-air debate occurred over a commemorative Obama plate and arguments between hosts and callers were frequent.

Anthony made controversial comments about the need for improvement within Black communities, sparking debate with callers Jay (a trucker) and Alan, who challenged his views and highlighted the hypocrisy of racial slurs' acceptance on the radio.  The hosts and callers discussed whether Obama's election fulfilled Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream and speculated on potential racial biases in media coverage. A caller questioned whether Black voters would have supported a Republican Obama.  A caller also alleged that Sirius XM planned subscription fee increases and the end of free online streaming.  The hosts then heavily criticized "America's Song," a SiriusXM/Oprah-promoted inauguration song featuring various celebrities, deeming it terrible.

Tito Ortiz joined the show, discussing his career, recent back surgery, UFC disputes over denied medical claims, upcoming fights, and a new MMA store.  Big John, another guest, joined the conversation, sharing graphic and sexually explicit anecdotes from a reality show experience. The discussion then returned to the inauguration, with commentary on the appearances of Ted Kennedy and Dick Cheney, more mocking of George W. Bush's speech patterns, and comments on Michelle Obama's appearance.  They also discussed a child molester who wrote "You Light Up My Life."  The hosts offered opinions on various political figures throughout the show.

A live segment focused on the inauguration, with the hosts and Big John offering a running commentary filled with crude humor and offensive remarks about the appearance of attendees.  They commented on the crowd's diversity and behavior, specifically mentioning a crying Asian woman, a woman in a Superman Obama shirt, confused older white men, Clarence Thomas and his confirmation hearing, various hats, and detailed commentary about women's appearances. Big John left for a clothing event before the segment’s conclusion.  The hosts expressed cynicism and amusement (or disgust) regarding what they perceived as the spectacle of the event.  The show concluded with more commentary on the inauguration and its attendees, continuing with the crude observations.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Isn't this a wonderful day, Anthony? A day of hope?  God has taken my voice today.  The Lord has taken my voice.  You have maybe 40% of your voice. 
[00:00:30]  I'm going for 0% by 9 o'clock.  We're going for 0% by 9 o'clock.  Where you have to get a notepad and a pen and write down your responses.  This is some kind of defense system.  What it?  This is some kind of defense system to keep my job.  Yeah.  If I can't talk, I can't say something that's going to get me in trouble.  Good point, good point. 
[00:01:00]  So you obviously lost your voice.  Oh, God.  I have some kind of a cough.  Cold thing.  Cough, cold thing?  And it took away half of my vocal cords.  I sound like Jack Klugman.  Like, my right side of my voice is okay.  It's like the left side's kind of, like, my tonsil's swollen. 
[00:01:30]  And it makes my voice sound like Mr. Haney from Green Acres.  So why don't you just use your right side of your voice?  Who needs the left side?  Apparently there's no shutdown like an engine.  I got a voice to box fire.  F the left.  Shut down the left side.  F the left, right, Anthony?  Hit by a flock of birds.  Hey, could you say, uh...  Where's Michael?  Where's Michael?  Very good.  Oh, my God.  Welcome back, Anthony, from your grandson, Frank. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  This is going to be an adventure today.  You missed yesterday, though, man.  We, uh, we interviewed a monster.  We just want to spend maybe two minutes on this.  Now, look, Patrice is a great...  I don't call him that.  Patrice was well-behaved yesterday.  He actually was, uh...  We were able to control him yesterday.  When we're able to control Patrice, he's just amazing on the radio.  Just amazing.  He was one day away from the biggest moment of his life.  So... 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  No, he was, uh...  Not as excited as I thought he would be.  Was I?  I don't know.  We didn't get into it too much, but he was just like, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, well, it's all happening.  Mm-hmm.  Because it's going down.  It's going down.  Obama.  I was going to say, because the n's up, but somebody might have misinterpreted that.  You know, and something's happening, and there's no avoiding it.  Yeah.  Yes.  Like what old-time gangsters used to say.  Mm-hmm.  Very nice. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  But we went over to SiriusXM, and we were face-to-face with Fedor.  Yeah, Fedor Emelianenko.  Who's like...  Monster.  He's a monster, who is an MMA fighter.  He fights for pride.  And we've had a lot of the MMA guys in studio over the years.  We've had Rampage Jackson, Randy Couture.  I'm talking about other monsters.  Liddell, Tito.  And Chuck Liddell.  Tito's coming in today, actually.  And when Chuck Liddell was in here, you know, he's a scary mofo, and he breathes like a bull the entire time he's in here. 
[00:03:30]  And he looks like he just wants to beat someone up for the hell of it, because it's just fun.  And I think we gave the edge to Fedor yesterday as far as scariest monsters ever to be on the radio show.  It's guys like Fedor and Chuck Liddell that make us feel like we're just not men.  We all like to think we're men, and we think we're tough, and we can protect our girls and do the right thing when it comes down to being a man.  And then one of these guys walks in, and you realize, ugh, you're nothing. 
[00:04:00]  You're nothing in the man's world.  What was intimidating about him, it was...  He's a heavyweight.  He's heavier than Chuck.  Yeah.  He's in a heavier division.  But it was his complete lack...  Of human emotions?  Yes.  Respect for the law.  He knocked a man out.  That's a man act.  No, it was his complete lack of posturing.  He was a really soft-spoken guy, and he wasn't trying to... 
[00:04:30]  That's even creepier.  He was...  And I've watched him fight, and he's just got dead eyes.  Yeah.  He wasn't trying to be tough.  No.  He was trying to be nice.  And he was a really frightening guy, but very sweet, and soft-spoken.  Every once in a while, he would give you a smile for maybe a split second, and then  go back to that Russian just stare.  Yeah.  And then he had henchmen with him.  Those guys were henchmen.  He was trying to say they were family and managers and agents and trainers.  They were some kind of henchmen.  Representatives. 
[00:05:00]  He is henchmen.  I think they were henchmen.  Jimmy, what do you think?  I mean, one of the guys was his trainer, and one of these guys was his bodyguard, I'm  sure.  The trainer was probably his bodyguard.  He has to have a bodyguard.  Yeah.  He can't be fighting people in the street.  Yeah.  He would love that, though.  He doesn't care.  He'd get sued.  He'd fight his way...  He would fight his way all the way to and through Starbucks if he had to.  But he doesn't look...  Look at his picture.  He doesn't look...  He doesn't look that tough when you just take a photo with him.  He looks like a nice fella.  Yeah.  He's like, yeah, who's that, your uncle?  Who's your nice guy?  He's like, Jimmy. 
[00:05:30]  Let me see.  That's what Bobby points out.  He looks like a big me.  He looks like me if I had man jeans.  No, what was the line that was used?  That you were a clone experiment?  Unfinished clone?  Unfinished clone of Fedor.  I wish I would have had a shaved head.  Oh, that's funny.  Yeah.  How do you go back there, Jimmy?  What did you do to me?  Let me see.  What did you do to me there?  He had a silly sweater on.  I wanted to kind of, you know, bring that to his attention, but I didn't dare mess with  this guy.  I only mess with the easy targets like Stalker Patty and such. 
[00:06:00]  Wow, you actually got a smile.  He didn't look like that during the whole interview, Jimmy.  Yeah, why didn't you throw something at him?  Yeah, you know, no kidding.  But at least I'll admit it.  I'm not even going to sit...  Like your chick.  It's the only thing he would allow.  Yeah.  Throw your chicks at him.  Will this save me?  Like feeding raw meat to a lion.  That'll slow him down for a few minutes before he continues trying to attack you.  But would you say scariest human being we've ever had in studio?  Yeah.  He wouldn't be if you just met him, but knowing how devastating a fighter he is, and then knowing 
[00:06:30]  how soft-spoken he is, and he's a really fast puncher.  He's a really fast mover on the ground.  He's a devastating fighter.  And knowing that, and then seeing this quiet demeanor, and just knowing the explosive,  vicious beating he could put on you.  In a second.  In a second.  He could turn on a dime.  And the Russian translator really brought it all home.  Not to take away from Liddell, because the MMA message boards listen to the show and all.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:07:00]  I mean, Liddell is a scary, scary dude.  Yeah.  But we give the edge to Fedor.  Of course.  Maybe because of the Russian translator.  Just makes it a little more, more what?  Just a little more uncomfortable, because you can't directly communicate.  You hear very soft-spoken.  Like a monster, like an alien.  You can't directly communicate.  And then we get, we're putting our lives in the hands of the translator.  You know, we're asking these questions.  And then, at one point, the translator, because he doesn't have a word for, I think it was  seaweed or something, goes sushi. 
[00:07:30]  We're like, whoa!  We didn't say sushi!  What else are you telling this guy that's a little off?  That could get us killed.  Because he's like, sushi?  I'm like, sushi?  He goes, well, I don't know what, what did he say?  I don't know what, how to say seaweed in Russian.  I'm like, well, thanks.  What else don't you know how to say in Russian that might be mistranslated with this animal?  You're calling him, like, a fruit.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Calling him a pansy or something.  No, we didn't say that.  It's like, you know, people like that remind me of that clip of that bear that is sitting 
[00:08:00]  next to the old woman, and everything's fine, and all nice.  Everyone's happy.  Everyone's happy.  And then the thing just strikes out out of nowhere and can just ravage you.  That's exactly what that guy is like.  Wearing a big sweater, too, so you don't see his arms.  Van Heusen?  Hopefully, yes.  Very stylish.  All face beaters wear the Van Heusen.  I got my gifts at the Borgata.  Oh, my parents brought the gifts. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, really?  Your Christmas gifts?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They were really good this year.  Were they?  What'd you get?  Some Brooks Brothers PJ bottoms.  That's not that bad.  Brooks Brothers.  Brooks Brothers.  Well, actually, yeah.  Two Brooks Brothers shirts.  A sports book about, you know, like sports figures.  Like who's in the sports book?  I wouldn't know.  Sports almanac?  Something of that ilk.  I won't look at it.  Let's say hi to Mac in Texas.  Mac. 
[00:09:00]  Hey, Hans.  Yeah.  Are you sure you didn't lose your voice yelling racial epithets at the MLK parade yesterday?  You never know how I lost my voice.  Mariko.  I think it's just like a flu or a cold or a cough or something.  No, I wasn't able.  I had no voice at all yesterday.  None.  I couldn't even.  But, like, yeah, all day yesterday, nothing would come out. 
[00:09:30]  There was a rumor that you, like, just stayed in Atlantic City for, like, two days just in  a hotel room being sick.  One whole day.  One whole day?  Complete day I had to just stay in bed.  Wow.  I couldn't even move.  Not so much that I didn't have any energy or anything.  I just couldn't.  I couldn't talk.  I needed a translator.  Like, I do sign language, but I couldn't even, you know, I couldn't even say, you know,  raise.  I had nothing.  The weird thing is.  Wait, you were gambling with this voice?  Well, that was when it first started. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, okay.  Like, it was fine, and it slowly just degenerated into nothingness.  That probably saved you a few grand.  If I hold my head up like this, it's not as bad.  Like Lemmy.  I can actually talk, yeah.  How about we have Kenny hold your head like that the entire morning?  It makes my neck hurt.  It's like when you, um...  Yeah, we'll get a strap, though.  When you pleasure a woman all night long, um, and then you pull your head back down and  your neck hurts.  Do you get a numb tongue today?  Why?  Well, you're saying, you know... 
[00:10:30]  No, I said that's like...  No, I understand.  I have that.  Yeah.  No, the tongue has nothing to do with it.  It's just my, uh...  Well, there's just my throat's a wreck.  You sure you're not this guy, by the way?  Jacksonville Beach Police got a call of a burglary in progress around 3 o'clock Sunday morning.  Someone had walked into a home on 3rd Avenue North where a 72-year-old woman was asleep  for the night.  Officers say they found the front door kicked in.  Following a search, they found 27-year-old Nicholas Rust in the living room.  Officers say he was sound asleep on the woman's living room sofa and naked. 
[00:11:00]  In the report, the man was described as heavily intoxicated.  A man who identified himself as Nicholas Rust told me he attended a concert that night.  When asked if he ended up in someone else's home in the wee hours of Sunday morning, he  said, quote, that's what they tell me.  Rust was charged with two misdemeanors, trespassing and disorderly intoxication.  The woman, who had a stranger in her home naked, did not want to talk about what happened. 
[00:11:30]  Probably because, you know, she doesn't want the neighbors to know that she might have  sampled the goods.  You think she sampled the goods?  The nude man.  How do you?  I don't understand that.  You get so drunk, you end up naked in someone else's house.  How does that happen?  That's drunk.  That is drunk.  That is blackout drunk.  All right, we're just getting started.  This will be kind of interesting.  You got a little tea there with lemon and honey? 
[00:12:00]  Yes, I do.  A little tea with lemon and honey.  Cheney in a wheelchair.  Huh?  At today's inauguration, Cheney.  Now they're pulling out all the secrets that were going on.  Cheney's in a wheelchair.  Yeah, well, he twisted his back moving some boxes into the new house.  Yeah, did he?  Wouldn't you think the vice president would have a mover?  Yeah, he's moving his own stuff.  Wow.  So you think he's been in this state for a while?  Well, when's the last time you saw him?  It's been a very long time. 
[00:12:30]  He did swear in the senators, the new senators.  And he's got all those heart issues.  He ain't moving any boxes out of no house or into a new house.  Oh, we're kidding.  Why don't they just tell us the truth for once?  For once.  Just tell us the truth.  Crowds arriving by the thousands.  Obama!  The day of Obama.  All the buses that are coming in.  They said if you line up all the buses that are going down to Washington,  who wants to guess how many miles?  And drive them into what? 
[00:13:00]  I'm going to guess it's going to be at least a quarter of a mile.  A quarter of a mile worth of buses, huh, Jimmy?  Yes.  Could be more than that, Jims.  I'm going to say it's 25 buses worth.  And what do you think?  If you line up all the buses.  Real answer.  I don't know what the question is.  How many felons?  How many?  How many?  So many answers here that I could give.  How many miles? 
[00:13:30]  Oh, how many miles would it stretch?  You know, by the way, I mean, it's all nice that everyone's going down to Washington for the inauguration.  Yeah.  We could broadcast.  Does anyone have work today?  Can you just leave work?  The roads were very, very light today, this morning.  Yeah, this is a day to take off.  I think a lot of people took off the double.  Between yesterday and today, they went for the double?  Went for the MLK, Obama.  Yeah.  That's what they're doing.  Yeah.  How many miles of buses?  Have you lined them up? 
[00:14:00]  I would say...  Eight hundred miles.  Jesus.  Then wouldn't you just walk to Washington?  How many miles is it to Washington?  Two to three.  Two hundred, maybe?  Two twenty from here?  It's a three and a half hour drive, right?  Yeah.  The answer is...  Two hundred.  Seventy-five miles.  Wow.  Wow.  All the buses that are going down there, if you lined them up, it would be a 75-mile convoy. 
[00:14:30]  That tailgating's dangerous.  They should add a few inches in between buses.  Mm-hmm.  Quick break.  How many minivan miles would that be?  Well, I got some great stuff for you, Anthony.  Obama hip-hop bus leaves for Harlem, leaves from Harlem to D.C.  Got that for you today.  Live from Obama Elementary School, talks to the school board president about the name change.  They're already changing schools for the Messiah. 
[00:15:00]  Yes.  For the new Lord Jesus Christ.  And we got some other great things to get to today.  Big story of the day.  Brand new president, Barack Obama, being sworn in later today.  I saved something for you today, and I was hoping you would have a full voice for this.  A suicide pill?  Well, eh.  I and I kept it.  A suicide pill?  Eh.  I brought in letters to Obama from children.  Oh, I thought you were going to say from me. 
[00:15:30]  I thought I wrote anonymous on that.  From children.  Okay.  And I kind of want you to answer the little letters, because they're asking Obama all sorts of questions,  because they're convinced that Obama's going to answer their letters.  All right.  I'll answer them.  I know you will.  I'll give the little kitties an answer.  All right.  We'll do that next.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Instant feedback coming in.  Big time.  We were just talking about those buses. 
[00:16:00]  If you line up all the buses going to Washington, it would stretch for 75 miles.  Yeah.  Well, Cody from Indiana.  All those buses are only 75% full because nobody is sitting in the back.  And then he writes, I'm ashamed of myself.  And then you got Jim.  That's a good joke.  Yeah, that's a good joke.  Jim McSweeney from New Jersey.  And losing his voice on Inauguration Day is another Obama miracle.  That's the second miracle from the Messiah. 
[00:16:30]  The first being the plane crash in the Hudson River.  Which, by the way, we were just talking about, that plane had some problems.  A couple of days.  Was it a couple of days or a couple of weeks earlier?  I thought it was like even a couple of days.  Was it a couple of weeks?  A compressor problem.  And one of the engines made this huge bang noise.  Right.  And one of the people said, it sounds like the wing came off.  Yeah, one guy on the plane, because they weren't high enough yet, so he could still use his phone,  texted his wife and said, you know what, I just heard a really scary noise on this plane. 
[00:17:00]  I'm hoping for the best.  And they were able to turn that one around.  Oh, no, they didn't turn it around.  They fixed it in the air.  And landed it in Charlotte a mere couple of weeks ago.  That's the plane that Sully had, like, you know, crash land into the freaking river.  Did you see the, they actually did have a video?  Yeah.  Of it coming in.  And, oh, that was good.  I think I got a little, I think I got part of my vocal cord back right there.  That was odd.  Just kind of.  Something just scraped off your vocal cord. 
[00:17:30]  Came back for a second.  Nice.  Small batch of seeds.  Is that what happened?  Thank you, Jimmy.  Yeah, you're welcome.  That stuff's medicine.  Yeah, it is good for you.  Good and good for you.  What were you saying?  Yeah, the, um, God, I forgot what I was saying.  It's a miracle with my vocal cords.  The footage of the, uh, plane landed.  He kept that nose up, man.  That was the key to the whole thing.  Yeah.  The whole thing.  Right on the tail.  And then, uh, boy, you don't realize how damaged the bottom was until they pulled it out of the water. 
[00:18:00]  It was, uh, it was a mess.  And now, uh, I know Jimmy flies a lot.  I do.  So I'd like to ask him what he thinks about the five G's they're giving everybody because of their luggage, which they said may be, um, in government, uh, possession for a long time.  If, if you ever get it at all.  Five thousand a piece?  Everyone's five grand and they're refunding the tickets.  Which is, oh, thanks for that.  Which is hysterical.  It's like, how could you not?  They were in the air for five minutes. 
[00:18:30]  And giving you seven frequent, uh, flyer miles.  So that's, that's nice that they're doing that as well.  That's nice.  Some scuba booties.  Yeah.  So your feet don't get cold.  Right.  What do I think of that?  Um, I think it's fair because this is one, unless it's an airplane problem, but if this was gooses, that I, I think that if gooses flew into the engines,  then you cannot fault the, uh, the airplaneer.  But I think that if it's not gooses and it's the airplaneer, then I think there's a major problem.  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Yes.  I think, but if it is gooses, then it has to be an active, uh, an active God.  But I don't understand.  What's, what's, uh, five thousand per person.  What's the, what's the problem there?  Uh, I don't know.  It depends on what you have in your, your bag.  Oh, yeah.  In your luggage.  The average person doesn't come close to $5,000 worth of stuff in their, uh,  luggage, right?  What if that's jewelry?  Well, then maybe you could argue that and go, look, you could look in my bag.  Cause that, that didn't end up in the Hudson River.  You'll see some fine jewelry in there. 
[00:19:30]  I need a little more than five G's.  Well, they said like some people might get some of their stuff back, but if some of those  bags came out and just are at the bottom of the, uh, Hudson, you're never going to.  Right, right.  You're never going to get it back.  Yeah.  But yeah, five G's.  Has there ever been a time where you have had more than five G's stuff in your bag?  I don't, I don't think my stuff adds up to, to $200 when I travel.  Seriously.  It's just clothes and, and smelly sneakers.  So I can maybe work out while I'm away.  I got to fly today, uh, Miami and I definitely am winning $5,000 worth of stuff. 
[00:20:00]  Are you going to be nervous today, Jimmy?  No, no, no.  I'll be okay.  Not at all, right?  No, but I actually have $5,300 in my luggage.  It's in nickels.  You're not flying out of LaGuardia, right?  Why would I?  I never do.  Unless I had to get to the Lincoln Tunnel real fast.  You know, for New Yorkers, that is the airport none of us want to fly out of.  And it has nothing to do with the G's. 
[00:20:30]  Well, now we had that.  But it's just how they take off and land because it's, it's, it's a, it's a tight, it's a tight area where that airport is.  Very short runway.  They go up, they go up really steep and they come down very steep.  And they have to sometimes take some nice, solid, out of control left-hand turns to line up the runway.  And now we got to worry about the G's?  F that.  I think I've flown out of LaGuardia once in the last 10 years.  It's always Newark or JFK. 
[00:21:00]  You do?  Yeah.  Well, it's easy for you.  Florida, yeah, it's easier.  But, um, yeah, that's kind of like, I like somewhere like Newark, Kennedy, where you got, although Kennedy, even though it's got a long runway, they built Kennedy in the middle of a bird sanctuary.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Which is kind of like, eh.  But they do have those things.  You ever see them shoot off those, they're like shotgun shell blanks that are in tubes at the ends of the runways.  And they blow those off to get the geese out of there because, God forbid, you just go around shooting the geese. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  And I think it's time to just start killing every single bird you see.  Let the pilots have machine guns on their wings like the old fighter planes.  Oh, how cool would that be?  So you just chew up the geese.  What are you supposed to do?  If you take off and there's a flock of gooseies, what are you going to not shoot them?  Goosey.  They are indeed silly, too.  Gooseys.  Hey, Ant's back, obviously, and he was in AC when he got sick.  So I won $100,000, writes off the instant feedback.  He's from California. 
[00:22:00]  Ant, did they bring the blackjack table to your bedside?  That would have been nice.  Roll it in like room service.  You know what, though?  Put some Asians next to me to play.  You are a whale, so I bet you if you requested that, they would actually get that done.  Just get a dealer up there into the room.  I bet you they would have done that in a second.  Yeah.  I played a lot of poker.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then, of course, Keith got his big victorious moment where he played me pretty badly and  fooled me pretty good, took a good pot off of me.  Yeah. 
[00:22:30]  Made him feel good, so he could go screw.  Good for him.  All right.  The Obama hip-hop bus.  Just playing all this audio that's going to make Anthony very happy today.  The hip-hop bus.  The hip-hop bus is leaving Harlem for D.C.  Is this for the Notorious movie?  Is there going to be gunfire and knives?  The Notorious movie had some problems.  No crap.  But also that Bloody Valentine movie that's in the paper today had some problems out on 
[00:23:00]  Long Island.  Yeah.  Some people like horror movies, too.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  Do we know that?  Yeah, it was a security guard apparently snapped it.  Look, you don't translate his code yet?  It's a theater on Long Island.  I don't know.  Find the theater.  Brentwood?  Supposedly some guy is like, you've got to leave now.  Movie's over.  We need you out of here.  And then whoever was, this person was like arguing, I'll leave when I want.  So then supposedly the usher pulls out a little pocket knife and just starts jabbing  him.  Why was usher there? 
[00:23:30]  Wham.  Wham.  Wham.  Wham.  Wham.  All right.  He'll find the details on that, but here's the hip-hop bus.  Hip-hop bus.  Psyched.  Leaving from Harlem to D.C.  Shoving off from a New York City curb, this is a loudest  proud pilgrimage from Harlem all the way to Capitol Hill.  It is not your grandparents' inauguration celebration.  Barack from Bedford-Stuyvesant is the on-board MC.  Though he spells it differently, Barack shares the president-elect's first name. 
[00:24:00]  Tonight, this rapper could not feel more proud.  When I was a little kid, a lot of people used to make fun of my name.  They're like, what kind of name is that?  You know, who would name that kid Barack?  So far riveting.  Yeah.  It's like John Coffey.  Like the drink, only spelled different.  Oof.  Well, it's true.  I know.  Not funny, but true.  I remember him, oofing him.  His big, dumb, retard explanation.  I know.  We get it. 
[00:24:30]  Exactly.  Quit blowing death into little girls, you creep.  Or whatever trick he pulled.  Whatever gag he had.  What did he do?  He'd swallow death and spit it out and make a fool of himself.  Evil or some kind of crap, you know.  He'd suck in some evil death, whatever, out of people.  And then breathe it back into someone else's face.  I'd like to drink.  Only spelled different.  I sure would like some of that cornbread your wife makes.  More from the hip-hop bus. 
[00:25:00]  Obama's presidential run was truly a youth campaign,  so it's not surprising the young adults bobbing their heads on this bus  are so inspired by the biracial man about to lead the free world.  Myself as a biracial person, it's real cool to see a biracial president  stepping up there and, you know, representing everybody.  But especially black people.  He's a good example for the youth because even though he didn't have a father in his life,  he still grew up to be successful. 
[00:25:30]  Successful.  He did grow up to be very successful.  Well, yeah.  There's an L at the end of the word.  Use it.  I'm going to have my voice for five minutes on this show today.  I'm going for 9 o'clock, shutting it completely down.  That's my goal.  I'm going to have a lot left because if I've got to listen to these idgits.  What?  It's very nice.  We've got one more clip from the hip-hop bus.  I like the one comment.  Biracial president is there for all of us, especially black people.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Really?  That's not what Obama's saying. 
[00:26:00]  Well, they don't like listening to what Obama says about all that.  No, apparently not.  They're like, they probably look at Obama and go, we know.  We know you have to say that, but we know you're there for us.  Obama's saying, look, it's just America.  It's not African-American.  It's not Asian-American.  It's not whatever American.  It's just America.  Right.  But these people are hearing something completely different.  I know.  You're here for us.  You think they're waking Obama like, yeah, I know.  You have to say that.  It's a white world still.  But we know you're there for us. 
[00:26:30]  As the bus pulled into the District of Columbia, Harlemites hopped off to greet strangers like  they've been friends for decades.  By us being one of the first to have a multicultural, multiracial president, we're opening the doors  and leading the way to give everybody opportunity.  This is truly the American dream, you know.  I just want to be a part of it.  You know, I want to witness history.  This is something great.  Mm-hmm.  Well, witness history. 
[00:27:00]  Have fun.  Starting off on the right foot, taking a day off from work to maybe get a glimpse of  all the work parts.  Get a day off from what?  I get it.  They don't work.  I'm sorry.  You're right.  I wasn't saying that.  I'm just saying you don't know what this guy's occupation is.  The stabbing was at a theater in Valley Street, the home of, I think, Jim Brewer's from Valley  Street.  I think that's kind of like, you know Long Island better than I these days.  Could have just been a little white punk. 
[00:27:30]  And it was a 24-year-old usher basically telling the 16-year-old kid, you got to leave the  theater.  After this My Bloody Valentine movie is done, and the kid was yip, yip, yipping, and the  usher said, all right, and just started stabbing him with a pocket knife.  Jesus.  It's getting very dangerous to go to movies lately.  That must have felt so good, though, for the usher.  All right.  Who doesn't want to stab somebody yip, yip, yipping?  The little pocket knife, too.  Yeah.  They go in so easy.  It's like a little nail clipper file you're stabbing someone with.  I don't think you're able to keep your job after that, though, huh? 
[00:28:00]  Why not?  I don't think you could justify stabbing anybody.  He was yipping.  He was yip, yip, yipping.  How great would that be if there was a bunch of noisy Boyds, and they were just chirping,  and you stabbed a couple on your stoop.  Wouldn't that be wonderful?  Boy.  I haven't slept in two days, man.  I hate my fat pig body.  Why?  What happened, Jimmy?  Ugh.  What's the matter?  Just hate it.  Why?  What happened?  You're working on it. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, I am.  You look so much better than you ever did.  Ugh.  I just saw a video of myself receiving something.  Oh, Jesus.  You're videotaping yourself?  Why wouldn't I?  It's on YouTube.  Yes.  It's on your tube.  You tub.  It should be on.  Fat pig.  Selfish fool I am.  That's a bad angle if you were doing the video. 
[00:29:00]  Well, I'm holding the camera.  I'm aiming it down, and it's going over my stomach, so I'm trying to hold it.  It's like footage taking it from above, and then I put it to the side to get the different  angle, and I caught a whole lot of my torso, and I don't know what, it looked like she  was eating a sea lion.  God.  We broke up over it.  We broke up over it.  No.  Yeah. 
[00:29:30]  What, you're done?  I'm so depressed.  Yeah, I'm just a fat pig.  My fault.  No.  That's why you broke up.  Yeah.  I, I, I, I, yeah.  Over your, over your?  I did it, yeah.  Because of your fatness?  Oh, yeah.  My fat stomach.  Because of your blubber?  My blubber.  You actually broke up with a chick because of blubber?  You motivated the whole thing?  I certainly did.  I'm a psychopath.  You know that?  Wow, you must be really not sleeping, man.  I haven't slept in two days.  I was depressed.  This all finished a couple hours ago.  Lonely?  Up all night.  I won't be, though. 
[00:30:00]  The kid is back.  The kid is back.  The kid is back.  The ladies and germs.  Instead of gentlemen.  Line up.  You could be next.  He's better than ever.  He's back.  He's fatter than ever.  He's, his back has fat on it, too.  Fuck.  Oh, well, that's a shame.  Yeah, it is.  Jesus.  What's going on in your pants, though? 
[00:30:30]  I don't know.  It's always there.  Hopefully a brush fire.  No, nothing.  It looked like you were tenting.  No.  Just the thoughts.  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  All right, hey, they're changing schools out there for Obama.  They did this for JFK, and who else?  Some of the astronauts when we were growing up?  I went to John Glenn High School.  So there you go.  And astronaut John Glenn.  MLK got some schools named after him.  Who else?  Only in the best neighborhoods.  Yeah.  John Glenn never showed up at our school.  Why would he? 
[00:31:00]  Because his name is on the front.  You think he cares?  No.  That is kind of an insult, though, that you name your school after a person, and he doesn't  show up.  What else does he have to do?  I know.  Put a date on your calendar where you take a little visit and wave to the little effers.  He didn't even do anything like go to the moon.  He just kind of went up there, came back down.  Yeah, yeah.  No time.  Exactly.  He must have been there since you graduated.  No, from what I hear, you know.  He never showed up.  Nope.  He should have named it after somebody that would have come, like Larry Linville High 
[00:31:30]  School.  He couldn't show up now.  He's dead.  Yeah, now he won't.  He's on McLean Stevenson.  Old Ferret Face High.  A little known fact, Stephen S. from Bayshore, Valley Stream is the same town where that Walmart  employee was trampled to death on Black Friday.  That makes sense of them.  By those cows, those women that stay out all night just to save like 5, 10% on some dumb  item.  The door buster specials.  I have a feeling this Saturday we can look forward to a lot of casualties at the bankrupt 
[00:32:00]  Circuit City.  That already started.  Did it?  Yeah.  When you go in the store, they trick you.  They say they're liquidating everything in the Circuit City.  You go there and there's barely anything on sale because how this stuff works, they make  the announcement so they get a huge rush of people who are now buying stuff they wouldn't  have bought if they didn't get the announcement.  And then as the days and the weeks go on, then they start dropping 5%, then it's 10, then  it's 15, then it's 20.  And then you finally go there about three, four weeks from now, it's like 75% off, but 
[00:32:30]  it's just horrendous stuff that's left.  No one needs a fan with like three blades on it.  Right, right.  One broken off.  I've always lost out on the liquidation sales.  What was the other one?  And I went into one of these, what the hell, it was a CD, I guess it was, I forgot what  the CD stores were called.  Mega.  Virgin or Tower.  Oh, Tower.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I finally went into the Tower Records liquidation sale and wow.  You could get CDs for like five bucks, but there was nothing worth, you know, taking. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Rich Voss is a...  Yeah, exactly.  Here's a school name change for Obama.  Allison Caden is live at Ludlum Elementary in Hempstead where students will view the swearing  in ceremony in just a few hours.  Good morning to you guys.  It's actually now officially Barack Obama Elementary School.  The name change went into effect in late November after a unanimous school board vote.  And joining me now is the school board president, Charles Renfro. 
[00:33:30]  Thank you so much for joining us.  Tell me a little bit about this vote.  Uh, whose idea was it to change the name of the school?  Uh, one of our trustees, Mrs. Betty Cross, brought the Revolution for it.  And, uh, of course it was an unanimous vote and we were all excited about that.  The Revolution for it?  Who...  Uh, are these people morons?  Did you mean resolution?  Yeah.  What happened?  He said revolution.  He said revolution.  And you...  Was it...  And who was it?  Resolution?  He's the superintendent.  He's the superintendent.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, Jesus Christ.  How about you don't change the name of the school?  How about you teach the people that are in it? 
[00:34:00]  Or the people that are trying to even teach?  Holy Mother of God, we're doomed.  We're doomed.  We're doomed.  We're so doomed.  What time are we doomed?  What time did the dooming festivities start today?  Noon.  Noon.  What time is the extra sworn in?  Right around noon.  It goes right away.  Well, then, uh...  I don't know what to tell you.  I thought it was at night.  Dude, in this day and age, it'll be everywhere.  As soon as you land...  Can I YouTube it?  Yeah, you could YouTube it.  You tub it.  Won't you, like, be over, D.C. at the time? 
[00:34:30]  Just look down.  I'll be on, uh...  Look like ants bringing a cricket into the hole.  You can't see anything from that height.  People want you to do a rock scream, Anthony.  And they want me to get you a robe and a bowl of soup today.  Some broth and a poodle.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A cockapoo.  Yeah, let's go to George in Asbury Park.  Want some warm tapioca? 
[00:35:00]  George?  Yo, what's happening?  Hey, man.  What's going on?  My stepson's school is closed today because, uh...  Oh, but because of the inauguration.  They are...  All the schools are closed and all the kids can, uh...  Watch with their families.  How about that?  That's wonderful.  All right, well...  This is not unusual.  When huge things happen in this world, 
[00:35:30]  they do close schools or, like, don't teach that day  and then roll in the big TVs.  Well, let me tell you, the schools didn't close  when I was a kid when the Apollo program was going on.  They wheeled the TV in and we watched it in the classroom  with our classmates and the teacher to explain things.  That's what I mean.  Day off.  It was a day off.  You got to watch TV that day.  It was educational.  Yeah.  Because you talked about stuff.  It's not going to be educational at home.  It would be smoking blunts and just watching it.  And this forces a lot of parents to get daycare. 
[00:36:00]  Because a lot of two-family, two-parent homes are working.  So now what are the kids going to have to do?  Two-parent homes?  Oh.  Are you people all insane?  Holy Christ.  50 percent.  Everyone's brainwashed.  75.  75.  Oh, that tea is so soothing on my throat.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  Oh, God.  They are just all, all, all the networks are there.  Look at this. 
[00:36:30]  Well, what do you want them to do?  Yes.  Where are they supposed to be today?  It is kind of the inauguration.  Ignore it like I am.  The ignore, ignore duration.  That's what I'm going to do.  What would you, what would you want them to do today?  This is what they do every four or eight years.  No, they don't.  That's just it.  Well, it's been eight years.  They don't.  And now, like, you know, the media has drastically changed in the last eight years, too.  Dude, this is not, this hoopla is not what happens every election. 
[00:37:00]  It's the first black president.  It is a big event.  It's the first biracial president.  He's black.  Let's just give it to him.  Believe me, I agree wholeheartedly.  But.  Let's enjoy it.  What?  Just enjoy it.  I can feel my fat folding in on itself when I lean over and read the paper like this.  It's enough to make you kill yourself.  Don't kill yourself.  You're a funny man.  Thank you.  Tee hee.  Couple of.  All right, we'll take a break. 
[00:37:30]  And we'll continue.  I got, I got letters from children to Obama.  That's what I want to hear.  That I want to read for, read to Anthony today.  I want to hear what they ask the president.  All right, we'll do that next.  Don't be it, Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Jimmy's very tired and he's wearing a Snuggie.  And has half a voice.  Yeah.  This is just terrific.  The tea is soothing. 
[00:38:00]  That's good.  877-212-O-N-A.  Give me.  That Snuggie is the worst invention ever.  I'm wearing my Snuggie.  And I was just kind of couch bunying up.  Yeah.  I want to say.  It's called a douchey.  I despise the Snuggie.  I loathe it.  As I've never loathed anything.  Loaved.  Loaved.  I don't make bread.  I detest the Snuggie.  It makes you look like an idiot. 
[00:38:30]  Of course it does.  It makes everyone look like an idiot.  The colors that they chose to make the Snuggie in is horrendous.  Do you think the Snuggie is good for, though?  And it feels like, and the material feels like it's going to give you a rash or something.  Jimmy's spinning in a circle of Snuggie.  I thought you'd like it because the back is open.  I do.  Wait.  It's called touch your toes and get a gift.  Oh, don't burn the Snuggie. 
[00:39:00]  I hope he's got a lighter to see if it's flame retardant.  I want matches.  Let me, like, flick some matches at you.  I bet it's supposed to be, like, flame retardant.  Oh, really?  Gives you a shock when you take it off?  50 shocks.  50 shocks.  The Snuggie stinks.  The Snuggie's very electrical.  I hate the Snuggie.  I'd rather wear ice cubes.  A baggie of ice cubes around my neck.  And curl up outdoors and watch a sodomy. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, and some feedback coming in.  We were just talking about that school that was named after Obama.  Yep.  Now, here's a very intelligent listener.  Halftime the trucker, I guess his name is.  He writes, how about we wait until he does something first before they start naming things after him?  True.  Now, that is a very good way to look at that.  The guy's, he has officially run a successful campaign.  Wow.  Or been the center of attention on a successfully run campaign.  That's it. 
[00:40:00]  I feel bad for him because it's never going to get better than this.  Because the expectations for this guy are ridiculous.  And as soon as people realize, wow, he can't change the world.  He can't change this country drastically.  There's going to be a lot of disappointed people out there.  Ah, the dumb libs.  They're the ones that will all be disappointed.  And then they won't be.  They'll just make excuses.  That's what they do.  They make excuses.  Oh, well, he had this.  He inherited this.  Eight years ago, this happened.  Good luck to you, Obama. 
[00:40:30]  Good luck.  Let's go to Dano in Kentucky.  He's a regular to the O&A show.  What's up, Dano?  Hey, good morning, fellas.  Good morning.  Hey, I was wondering, do you guys find it odd that everybody keeps comparing people going to the inauguration as a hodge or a pilgrimage?  It's just as if it's a big religious event.  Yep.  I noticed all this stuff.  Believe me.  This is this big thing that they're talking about like it is. 
[00:41:00]  Like it's a religious event.  Like they're all going to the wailing wall.  I think they're in for a huge disappointment.  When?  Today?  Down the road?  When?  I give it six months.  I was on election day.  Of course you were.  Six months.  When they realize there's no free lunch.  Yeah, of course.  All right, Dano.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to 13-year-old JC who stopped by yesterday.  You missed the visit from the 13-year-old.  His mom's hot. 
[00:41:30]  She's a lawyer.  Yeah.  With JC, your mom has very nice boobies, by the way.  We were all checking them out.  Jesus.  Very nice.  And they looked very nice in her little, what kind of shirt?  She's wearing a muumuu.  A muumuu?  No, she had a snuggie ass.  She had a button-up blouse on.  Yeah, she had a white blouse, kind of knocked off a couple buttons to get our attention.  But they had some nice weight to them.  She had some...  She looked like a young Annette Bening, Anthony.  Some heft.  Yeah.  What do you got?  Oh, that made JC hang out more.  Probably some upset. 
[00:42:00]  You know what?  Aw.  Now you've gone too far.  All right, we lost JC.  We say hi to Riley in Boston.  We stopped by for just to say hi.  Just to say hi.  He wanted to tell everyone that if you wear a snuggie, you look like a gay Jedi.  That's a pretty good line.  That's true.  Riley, what's up?  Yeah, I just called it brown eye.  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  Hey, Riley.  Hey, listen.  Things are already so bad, and they're just about to get worse. 
[00:42:30]  I had somebody the other day request a reduction in their work week because they're working  40 hours a week.  They're making too much money to qualify for government assistance.  So what?  They want less hours so they can get that.  Less hours to get the government assistance on your pay.  Exactly.  Exactly.  So while the rest of us are all working our butts off working 40 hours a week to pay or  more, to pay taxes for these idiots to work less and have their hand out.  And if you think it's going to get better with Obama, you're wrong. 
[00:43:00]  Because the rest of us don't look for shortcuts ever, right?  Hey, you're single.  Like the way you think.  Yeah, no kidding.  All right, Riley.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Malik in Asbury Park.  Malik.  Yeah, yeah.  What up, fellas?  Good.  Hey, Malik.  Hey, yo.  Didn't that last call from Asbury say the schools was closed out here today?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's beautiful.  That means my weed man ain't in school today.  So we're going to get it in.  I'm already three in. 
[00:43:30]  We're going to go for 17 for the remarkable 20.  It's a beautiful day today, man.  Got to give it up for Obama.  20 blunts?  20.  20 godfathers.  Yeah.  Is this a big day for you, really?  Are you really looking at this?  Yeah, no doubt.  Yeah, historic.  Hey, stop being a spagot and spit it out and start talking, man.  I wish I could.  It comes back a little bit and then goes back to crap.  It's on and off, you know. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  All right.  My voice is being lazy and shiftless today.  Jesus.  The reality of it is, the reality is this, guys, you know, he ain't going to be able to  do too much.  You know, those people going out there looking for a pilgrimage or a hodge, they're going  to be sadly, sadly woken up.  You know what I'm saying?  And when he really started his tour and his job, because, you know.  And look at the TV behind you.  See, there's a white guy there.  See?  There you go.  Oh, no.  There's plenty of guilty words. 
[00:44:30]  There you go.  Today's show is live in Washington right now with a lot of Obama supporters.  And there, look, one white guy.  There you go.  See?  It's not all black.  Why do I have this, like.  Thanks, Malik.  Why do I want that guy just to get the crap beat out of him by some thugs?  What, the white guy?  Yeah.  I just really would like that.  A guy coming in, I know what you mean about a guilty white guy, but a guy going through  the inauguration because he's happy about it, I don't know, man.  I don't know. 
[00:45:00]  You know, that's fine.  But there are other white people that are just completely delusional.  And I would really love for them to, you know, hey, we're all one.  We're all united.  We're all everything.  Like those frigging four creatures that killed and raped that couple.  The white guy with the black wife.  White guy, black wife, four black guys, break into the house, rape and kill the wife, kill 
[00:45:30]  the husband, and then took some, you know, some crap that was laying around the house.  And they just called it a robbery.  Not racially motivated.  Yeah.  But, you know, when you rob something, when you rob somebody, I don't think raping and  murder keeps it in that robbery category.  I think it's a lot more personal.  They raped her.  It was brutal.  They tortured the couple.  Yeah.  But they will not call it a hate crime because it was black guys committing it.  It's just the same stuff you hear us saying all the time.  Look it up.  The guy and his wife, the Marine and his wife, white Marine, black wife, four black Marines. 
[00:46:00]  Just look it up.  And you tell us we're crazy.  Yeah.  So that's why I just like, you know, the thought of somebody there going, hey, we're  all one, we're all together, this is a great moment in history, wham-o, and start hearing  the old Christmas music.  Fair enough.  You know, just a couple.  What do you think?  Peaceful gathering today?  I'm sure there'll be some kind of issue.  You think?  Well, whenever you get a couple million people anywhere, there's going to be something that 
[00:46:30]  happens.  You think?  A lot or a little?  Not a lot.  A few isolated incidents.  Got a lot of security there.  A few isolated incidents.  They have over-  What do you think the incidents will be over?  Sneakers?  What?  Sneakers?  T-shirt?  Jane?  What?  You tell me.  Stocks?  Oh, God.  I am bad.  I know I am, but-  Getting fresh.  It's from a lifetime of just dealing.  Let's say hi to Tom on Long Island. 
[00:47:00]  Tom, how are you?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  How you guys doing today?  Good, man.  Real good.  No, I just got a comment.  And Jimmy's book has a chapter called People I Want to Kill On Sight.  A little plug for you, Jimmy.  Thank you.  I got three right now.  Keith Olbermann, Rachel Maddow, and whoever the guy is that answers your guys' phones.  Those are my three.  I don't know who this guy is, but if you could set it up and I come in there and fight with  him, I would love it.  His pompous attitude.  What does he do?  Oh, hey, who's this?  Like, come on. 
[00:47:30]  You got a great job, dude.  He hangs out with you guys all day.  Hey, it sounds like he lost his puppy.  It's not all that great.  Boy, he doesn't sound excited on the phones.  Not at all.  Not enough for me, I hope.  Yeah, this guy's trashing you there, Travis.  Are you excited to answer phones, Travis?  Here comes Travis.  Yeah.  Put your headphones on.  There are no headphones.  Why would there be headphones?  I've just noticed that over the years, phone screeners have always gotten a lot of crap 
[00:48:00]  because, and I won't totally go on the phone screener's side.  I'm sorry, Travis.  But you do get jaded to this point where you know the second someone picks the phone up  whether they have something or don't.  Yeah, absolutely.  So you just, you don't want to waste time and perhaps miss a good call.  Exactly.  So the crappy calls have to be thrown out right away.  But it is done very insensitively.  Yeah, and you know, sometimes people will call back and, you know, ask why I hung up  on them so abruptly.  But I just, I don't have the time to be very nice to everyone when there's, you know, four 
[00:48:30]  other people.  And there's points like, you know, right now where I know that we could be looking for  something to go to.  Something good.  Like we're talking about a subject that a lot of people want to talk about.  Yeah.  And then if someone's got crap, you're not going to sit there and go, well, I'd really  like to talk to you about that, but click.  Yeah, shut up.  So what was this?  Well, now I hung up, so we just wasted it.  You said I wasn't enthusiastic?  No, no.  I put them through. 
[00:49:00]  Right.  Well, you don't have time to be, you know, have phone manners.  You've got to like, you've got to, you're answering hundreds of phone calls and you've  got to, you know, get rid of people and try to screen them best you can.  They always say, you can hear a smile.  Yeah.  Well, there's other times, a lot of the phone calls that Travis puts through, I end up hanging  up on a lot of people without an explanation because now I want to free more phone lines  for other calls that might be coming in.  You can't take it perfectly.  We can't be polite is what it comes down to.  Yeah.  So go screw. 
[00:49:30]  Sorry, you know.  No, you're not.  No, I'm not.  All right.  I, uh, I saved some things for Anthony here.  Oh, good.  I saved the, uh, the front page of, uh, Newsday.  Oh, is it a fold out?  No.  Well, there's, they're all doing fold outs, but, uh, I saved, uh, the front page of,  uh, Newsday for you.  Yeah.  Have you heard this quote yet?  It is the quote they're all using, meaning the media.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rosa Parks, the Rosa Parks.  Oh, God. 
[00:50:00]  Let me just read it for you because I haven't, uh, gotten your, uh, reaction to this yet.  Rosa Parks sat so Martin Luther King could walk.  Oh, yeah.  I heard that.  Martin Luther King walked so Obama could run.  Obama ran so we could all fly.  I can't fly.  Who's flying?  What does that mean?  I'm sure they mean it figuratively.  Well.  Who wrote that?  I don't know who wrote that, to be honest with you.  I don't know the author of that. 
[00:50:30]  Who bit that off of someone else?  Who plagiarized that?  Wow.  A lot of people showing up there.  Uh, what are they expecting?  Over a mil?  Way over a mil.  Yeah?  It's pushing two now.  Pushing two million?  Yeah.  Jesus.  If only the scene could look like that one shot out of Independence Day.  Um, what shot? 
[00:51:00]  The one with, um, the president giving that inspiring, uh, speech.  Yep, I do remember that.  At the end.  I liked it a lot.  And this is our Independence Day.  It's good.  Yeah.  That's the shot.  It's a big, rousing, kind of, pride-inducing speech.  God, I can't believe this.  I just can't believe this is actually happening.  Why is this helicopter coming in? 
[00:51:30]  Does it take Bush out?  Is this just, like, Bush gonna wave and then just kinda, hey, hasta la vista.  What's his, does he get to have a parting word, um, when he leaves the White House?  To Middle White Fingers stuck out the helicopter.  Like Tricky Dicky.  You know, he threw his hands up in that peace sign.  You won't have dick.  You won't have old Richard Nixon a kick around anymore. 
[00:52:00]  Wow.  Look at all the huge screens that they got there on the mall.  And, uh, a lot of flashes going off.  A lot of people taking pictures.  How far away are they gonna be from Obama?  Two or three thousand miles.  No one's gonna get near this guy.  Look at this.  Did you see the distance between where Obama's gonna be and where the crowd is?  It's gotta be a quarter mile.  It has to be a quarter mile.  At least.  That looked like a half mile. 
[00:52:30]  Wow.  And it's gotta be a little brisk.  A little brisk.  In what, the 30s today in D.C.?  Have fun.  Well, it's not gonna be bad at all.  They were worried about that, uh, that cold weather we had last week, but that's out.  No, it's just regular winter weather.  It's easy.  I'm gonna spend the inauguration in front of my fireplace.  Yeah.  Watching some TV.  Maybe I might try to find an old I Love Lucy.  Something from the good old days. 
[00:53:00]  Old honeymooners.  Let's say hi to Rob.  Rob, how are you?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's going on?  I heard that that quote in yesterday's Newsday was, uh, written by Jay-Z.  Yeah.  That's what they've been saying on the other, uh, news stations and stuff and media.  Was that really, that's a quote from Jay-Z for real?  Yeah, there's actually, uh, an article somewhere with that quote in it, and they referenced  Jay-Z as being the one who wrote that, who quoted that.  Stupid quote. 
[00:53:30]  No one's flying anywhere.  I don't know what newspaper article that was in, but it was actually quoted by Jay-Z when  you go through the whole article.  And Obama ran so we could all fly.  Mm-hmm.  We could all fly.  There you go.  So we could all fly.  Make an emergency landing in the...  Shut up, you...  God, just...  I ruins my line.  You, you, buddy, son of a bitch.  You try it again.  Make me yell, no, no.  It was funny, and I know it was.  Guy could go screw himself.  Well, I think that, uh... 
[00:54:00]  That was interrupting cock.  I think that quote was given by Geese, so I'll steal your...  Plane theme.  And then a couple of them got excited and flew right into what they thought was a special  place for presidential people.  They felt like it was a little warm engine.  It looks warm in there.  Yes.  Guy made me yell with my stupid voice.  God.  All right, well, uh...  How come he interrupted your line?  Sorry.  You were right at the punchline. 
[00:54:30]  I'm right at the punchline.  I'm just going through the whole setup and everything, and he's babbling like an idiot.  With nothing.  You think you hurt your line by babbling over it?  Did he ever.  Did he, Jim?  Did he?  That's funny.  What a douche.  He traipsed over your line.  I was hoping he would realize I'm talking and stop.  But no.  Of course, one day.  He just kept talking.  He barreled right over it.  Oh, creep.  It really did.  Your luggage was Samsonite, and we know who he was. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  What about these letters from these little kids?  Yeah, we'll do that next.  I'm going to hear that.  And our phone number, 877-212-ON-A.  Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  You finally noticed the plate we gave you today, Ed?  Yeah, I always get my grapes in the morning, and they're very soothing on a sore throat. 
[00:55:30]  So there's a big pile there, and it took me a while to get to the bottom of the plate.  But as I noticed, it is in the commemorative change has come Barack Obama election day plate.  And it's Barack and an American flag and fireworks going off behind him.  Nice, right?  And my grapes are in there, yeah.  Nice little plate for you.  Wonderful, thanks.  Make sure nothing happens to that plate.  That's a rare one.  Oh, don't worry.  That's a very rare plate. 
[00:56:00]  We want him to save that.  We can get some money for that someday.  Yes, I'm sure you can.  And this just in from Kevin from Connecticut.  Bush was just on TV and said, good luck, bro.  So.  Wow, that's not good.  We're still waiting for your mom's box, and it'll be official.  Bush is out, and Obama's in.  Your mom's box.  Yeah.  I can't do an impression like that today.  Sounded like, um.  Er.  Tower read?  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[00:56:30]  Ah.  Yeah.  We got, um.  We got some Bush-isms for everybody.  Bush-isms.  A look back.  Some of the silly things Bush said in the last eight years.  You can do this with anyone, obviously, right?  Bush had some winners, though, man.  We start with this one.  The majority was elected on the Pledge of Fiscal Responsibility.  But so far, it's acting like a teenager with a new credit card.  The challenge facing the United States is that we have to be right one time. 
[00:57:00]  I mean, 100% of the time.  Oh, you see that quote.  Oh, well, yeah.  Yeah.  He corrected himself really fast, though.  They want us to leave.  That's what they want us to do.  And I think the world would be better off if we did leave.  If we didn't.  If we left, the world would be worse. 
[00:57:30]  The wars.  Ba-da-da-da-da.  Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Yeah.  It's hard when every word you say for eight years is just scrutinized.  Of course.  I mean, think of this show.  One hour, and we have 20 missteps.  Yeah.  And here to throw out the inaugural pitch at National...  This is a long one.  Do we want to go with it?  The famous booing.  Oh, with the crowd giving...  Well, his hometown stadium. 
[00:58:00]  When the Nationals opened up their stadium, they said,  Hey, this is perfect.  He's right down the road.  Let's bring Bush and have a nice moment with the president with the new stadium.  Didn't work out that way.  And here to throw out the inaugural pitch at National Spark.  To mark a new era of Washington baseball.  The president of the United States.  Maybe his middle name is Lou.  Like they used to do with Lou Piniella. 
[00:58:30]  Lou, they're not booing.  They're saying Lou.  They're not booing his boss.  I remember this, too.  He was waving like he's not hearing anything.  He's walking out there.  Hey!  There have been many presidents who have thrown out first pitches, 
[00:59:00]  but I don't know that anybody's ever done it better than this particular president.  That was from Houston.  Hi!  And usually they go to the front of the mound in these ceremonial first pitches,  presidents or otherwise.  He goes right up on the mound again,  just as we saw him at the World Series at Yankee Stadium in 2001,  soon after September 11.  Why not mention the fact that everyone is booing?  Maybe he should have been a pitcher.  Yeah.  He did such a damn good job there. 
[00:59:30]  But they ignore the fact that everybody's booing the presidents of the United States of America.  Oh, one of the best pitches we've ever seen thrown out.  As the crowd boos.  Right.  He should have went with the Yankees.  He's younger than most of the free agents to go after.  Let's say hi to Dan the trucker.  Dan, how are you?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I was just going to mention, man, we've got to reroute all of our routes today,  going up 95 anywhere near D.C. 
[01:00:00]  Man, it's costing us like a funnel today.  Anybody that gets a load, you know, going anywhere that way has got to, like,  go at least an hour and a half, two hours out of the way.  No track to trailers or anything through there, huh?  Yeah, it's got a 50-mile backup on all interstates going in, about 50-mile backup.  I just don't think these people realize they're going to be sitting in their cars,  nowhere to use the bathroom.  There are going to be people lining up on the side of the road using the bathroom.  It's just going to be disgusting. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, I mean, when you go to these big events, you've got to go so early,  and people are like, oh, I'm going to drive down to Washington on a whim today.  You had to be there two days ago.  You just can't get in your car this morning, even at 3, 4 in the morning,  and go, you know what, I'm going to drive down and check it out.  Yeah, it's not going to be fun at all sitting in your car.  Right.  You want to need to use the bathroom, you know, and you're just like,  women, what they do is fuck with a big concert.  Women will have their doors open, squatting on the side of the road.  It's going to be, it ain't going to be fun for them. 
[01:01:00]  I think it is.  All right.  Anyway, punch it out, guys.  Thank you.  I can't even imagine the traffic jam down there.  Oh, my God.  50 miles, Jesus.  50 miles heading into the city.  Getting back to some of the Bushisms.  And America needs a military where our breasts and brightest are proud to serve.  Our breasts and brightest, nice.  I know you said there will be a time for politics,  but you've also said you wanted to change the tone of Washington.  Howard Dean recently seemed to muse aloud whether you had advanced knowledge of 9-11. 
[01:01:30]  Do you agree or disagree with the RNC that this kind of rhetoric borders on political hate speech?  Yeah.  Look, there's time for politics.  And, you know, it's time for politics.  And I, you know, it's an absurd insinuation.  He was a little drunk, I guess.  He was caught off guard with that question.  He didn't know where to go with that. 
[01:02:00]  I didn't know how it was worded.  Yeah.  That's the worst answer to anything I've ever heard.  To anything?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Poor dummy.  Well, we can get back to that in a little bit.  I brought in letters to Obama for Anthony.  Now, apparently little kids writing letters to Jesus, Obama.  Well.  Jesus, Barack, Obama, Christ.  I hope the teacher, like, lowers their expectation and goes,  look, the president's never going to read your letter. 
[01:02:30]  Like Santa.  Yeah.  Unless maybe the principal is writing a response and signing an Obama or something.  Hopefully not the principal of that school that changed the name of the...  Well, yeah.  Well, and we got little Maria Rays.  She writes, dear President Obama, I want you to answer these or whatever, comment on them.  I wonder if you could make New York City better when you become president in January.  We have had a penny harvest.  First, we have gotten $500 in pennies.  I think you should give that money to people that don't have money. 
[01:03:00]  Clothes and food.  Are you having fun in the White House with your daughters?  I think you should spend time with your daughters by playing with them, doing activities with them,  and helping them with their homework, your friend, Maria.  First of all, Maria, he's not in the White House yet, so slow down.  Secondly, collecting pennies.  Woo.  Really got, what, $500, and you want to give it to him so he can dole it out? 
[01:03:30]  Mm-hmm.  Well, just let it sit there.  He'll come and take about $400 of your pennies and give it to people anyway  and leave you with $100, which will then be cut into about $25 when you try to spend it.  So you take a quarter out of all your pennies and have fun because that's all you're going to get.  Maybe it's time to teach the little lefers what taxes are all about.  It's never too early to teach them what they can look forward to.  They'll get a good lesson there.  That would be hilarious.  The principal comes along and goes, well, we've got to give up $300 of these pennies. 
[01:04:00]  You know the $500 pennies you got?  Yeah.  Give me $300.  Right.  Why?  Because I'm teaching you what Barack does.  Yeah.  Moving on, you got a letter from, wow, wow.  I don't even know how to say this name.  That's good because you don't have to.  K-H-O-M-I-K-E-S-H it looks like.  Oh, called Frank.  Yeah.  Dear Mr. Obama, I hope you have a long, long life. 
[01:04:30]  What was the best day of your life?  Wow.  That's a good question.  Best day of Obama's life.  Probably when he was able to come to this country and make a life for himself.  Other than, from what I hear, he actually was eating crickets.  And this is true. 
[01:05:00]  For a while, in Indonesia, I believe, he ate crickets and bugs as food.  And he had a pet monkey.  He did.  I read this today.  And now he's president.  And now he's president.  See?  That's cool.  I think probably coming here was probably the best day of his life.  But what would he be doing?  Uh-huh.  One could only imagine.  I can only imagine.  I've been imagining. 
[01:05:30]  Dear President Obama, this is little Gabriel Brown.  Aw.  Gabriel looks like she's about 10.  Adorable.  And she's of color.  A girl of color?  Yes.  Dear President Obama.  I voted for you.  I believe in you.  Wait, wait.  How did she vote?  See?  This is such...  They have little school elections.  You know what?  The kids.  They get involved.  I think it counted.  I think those votes counted.  You think?  I think there should be an investigation. 
[01:06:00]  She voted for him.  I voted for you.  I believe in you.  You are the first African-American president.  And you always go for what you believe in.  You never stop until you get it.  And you are very smart.  I hope you and your family love the White House and enjoy yourselves.  How does she know?  And what does she say?  He's the first what?  First African-American president.  He's a half.  He's a half.  Let's say hi to Tony in White Plains. 
[01:06:30]  Tony!  How you doing, guys?  Good, man.  Hey.  No-brainer.  Best day of Obama's life is when McCain took pill in as a running mate.  No kidding, man.  If that didn't put him over the top.  No kidding.  Later.  Let's say hi to Jared in Boston.  Jared.  Here we go.  Syndication now.  Dear President Obama.  When you lived in Indonesia when you were little, did your hiney hurt a lot?  A lot.  Fuck!  The wheels came off that one. 
[01:07:00]  Wow.  That guy just completely panicked.  First cursing.  Front two wheels came off.  Let's say hi to Mike in Lake Tahoe.  Mike.  Oh, the wheels on the bus.  Bring the s*** down.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  Good morning, gentlemen.  I have a question.  Yes, Mike.  Yeah, I wanted to ask Anthony if he thinks they'll be tipping well at the Red Lobster in D.C. today. 
[01:07:30]  God.  The waiters and waitresses in D.C. are crying today.  Just crying.  All right, boys.  Hope you have a good one, sir.  Thank you.  All right.  Uh, oh, you know what?  That's a very good point.  Well, wait a minute.  Uh, Anthony on Long Island.  Sir?  Yes.  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning.  Uh, Anthony, I just want to let you know mathematically, uh, 500 pennies is $5 and it's 5,000 pennies and 500.  She collected 500 pennies? 
[01:08:00]  No, $500.  Maybe I read that wrong.  Oh, okay.  No, she did get $500 worth of pennies.  Regardless, I was saying that for the penny harvest, $500, take 300 pennies away.  That's Republican taxes right there, not Democratic.  Punch it out.  All right.  Shut up.  Uh, you lib.  We got Charmin, age 5, from Jersey.  We did it, she writes.  What's this we?  We did it.  We voted for change and won.  What's this we?  Crap, you little bastard. 
[01:08:30]  Uh.  You didn't do anything.  One day, I would like to play with your daughters at the White House.  Oh.  Someday, I hope your daughters and I will make more changes at the White House.  Is this a little child of color?  Yes.  Are there sleepovers with your daughters at the White House?  Look at this little guy making some moves already.  If so, I would like to go, but I must ask my mommy and daddy.  When I grow up, I want to be a mommy and a dentist.  Uh-oh. 
[01:09:00]  A mommy and a dentist?  Yes.  Good boy.  Signed, Zell.  Zell.  It's a White Angel.  Someone's commenting and saying the person that wrote that is 23.  That's very funny.  What a dope.  A mommy and a dentist.  Yeah.  Women can't be dentists, you dopey kid.  Of course.  Especially not a mommy.  Exactly.  They're nurses.  Let's go to Tony on Long Island.  Tony.  Hey, fetch me some toothpaste.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  How's it going?  Pinch. 
[01:09:30]  All right.  What's up, Tony?  How's it going, guys?  Good.  Did you hear what Biden's wife had flipped up already?  Yes.  She dropped the N-bomb on Oprah.  Now, she mentioned that Joe Biden had the choice to be the vice president or secretary of state,  and he chose vice president.  Yeah, they gave him a choice, I guess.  Why is that a screw-up, though?  I don't know.  That seems like the type of thing that just goes on behind the scenes.  You don't want Hillary to feel second choice or make it obvious that she was second banana.  I'm sure that she had some choices on what she wanted to be, too.  Or you also want to make it seem like Biden was your absolute choice for VP. 
[01:10:00]  It doesn't seem like these guys really, like, thought it out.  They don't think it out too much when they're picking the vice president.  No.  It's almost like it's like a side thing to get a state or something in the end.  Yeah.  That's it.  The campaign and the presidency are worlds apart.  What you see in the campaign, and it's, you know, obvious I'm not breaking any new ground here.  What you see happening in the campaign, and then once they're in, it's completely different. 
[01:10:30]  Right.  You're right.  They just do it to get a state.  Monica, spelled with a K.  Monica is eight, Anthony, and she's white.  From the Bronx.  Little white girl from the Bronx.  Dear President Obama, this white section is in the Bronx.  Oh, I know.  Okay.  Yes, they're called Brooklyn and Queens.  Dear President Obama, congratulations on being elected as our 44th president.  I am in the third grade.  How are you going to stop the war? 
[01:11:00]  I am sorry to hear that your grandmother passed away.  Are you happy that you're going to the White House?  Will you read this note?  Signed, Monica.  Will you read this note is kind of a goofy question.  Kids are stupid.  Yeah.  Kids are so stupid.  Will you read this note?  If he doesn't, he'll never know.  Who's getting more letters, Santa Claus or Obama?  Obama at this point.  You think?  Yeah.  We move on to Oliver, who's seven and white from Queens.  Of course.  Dear Obama, my name is Oliver.  I go to school at PS150. 
[01:11:30]  I have a little sister named Penelope.  Oliver and Penelope.  I would like you to stop war.  You can stop it by putting it in newspapers.  I'm writing this letter because you are president and you might stop it.  Thank you for reading my letter.  Yours truly, Oliver.  P.S.  I'm glad you're president.  Are you?  Mm-hmm.  These kids have all been brainwashed by their parents, by the way.  They don't know anything.  They're just...  This is a brainwashing.  It goes on by their parents. 
[01:12:00]  What do they know?  And they're stupid liberal teachers.  I think he's great.  Well, it would have been fun if we got the kids that, you know, aren't following this  whole Obama wave and what they're writing.  Yeah.  Who?  They're out there.  Dear President Obama, this is Annie.  Annie Lynn.  Age seven.  Brooklyn.  I thought it was a stripper.  Did you feel happy when you won the election?  I was happy when you won.  My whole family voted for you.  That is why I am so happy that you won. 
[01:12:30]  I know that you will be a good president.  I hope that one day a girl could be president like you.  So far, only boys have been president.  I want to be president when I am big like you.  I'm so proud of you.  Yours truly, Annie Lynn.  See?  My whole family voted for you.  You're going to be great.  Because her family told her.  She don't know.  What do you think?  She's looking into facts.  Well, that's what happens when you're a kid.  You just go with what your parents like.  Of course.  And then you get to that age and you go, wow, my dad's likes suck. 
[01:13:00]  I'm going to go find my own likes now.  Hopefully.  Who's an independent thinker at age seven?  For real.  They should be.  Most of us pick our sports team because that's what daddy's watching on TV.  Yeah.  And then you follow that team for the rest of your life.  You didn't know any better.  That's true.  You weren't like doing your research on your teams.  Fatumata.  Age seven, the Bronx. 
[01:13:30]  What's his name?  It's a girl.  Oh, a girl?  I told you.  Fatumata.  F-A-T-O-U-M-A-T-A.  Uh-huh.  Oof.  I want you to change the world because it is not good.  I want you to make people believe other people and be good to each other.  And be nice.  We should visit each other and learn from each other and be one big family.  Yeah.  Let's put the kids in charge.  You'll have Lord of the Flies in two days.  Bunch of dopey kids. 
[01:14:00]  Let's be nice to each other.  Look at any friggin' schoolyard during recess.  Some fat kid's getting punched in the face because he's fat.  Right.  Calling names.  That's why maybe this is good.  Kids are stupid.  Maybe we could change a little bit.  There's no change going to happen.  Maybe people will start getting along a little more.  People like, um, people like what is familiar to them.  Mongo.  What do people covet?  Yes. 
[01:14:30]  Uh, dear President Obama.  Jim Pembrey.  Sorry.  You talked to him.  Sorry.  Jim Pembrey, damn it.  Yeah, man.  Jim Pembrey.  His stupid face.  All his face.  Jim Pembrey, damn it.  Go ahead, man.  Dear President Obama, could you please give me some help?  I have $500 of pennies and I have a pack of retards following me.  Jim.  Oh, if we were talking about, you know, the retards and the pennies. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Wouldn't have been funny anyway.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Travis in New Hampshire.  Travis.  I want to tell you, actually, good evening.  Hey.  Yes.  Sorry.  I want to tell you what is out there.  What if they catch Bin Laden next week?  What if they catch Bin Laden?  Who's they?  Yeah.  The military while Obama is in office.  Then Obama will get credit for that.  That ain't happening, though, because Bush really needed to catch Osama before he left office. 
[01:15:30]  He really wanted that done before he left office.  Yeah, I remember you guys talking about, like, the day before, they should, like, on the 19th, they should, like, bring out Bin Laden.  But I was waiting, but it never happened.  Well, here's a good idea.  How about we just follow all the terrorists that Obama just lets out of Guantanamo before he shuts it down as a purely political thing.  And we follow them and see where they lead us. 
[01:16:00]  Of course, God only knows where they're going.  Where they're going.  What?  Click.  Thank you.  I thought maybe he had a valid point he wanted to cover.  But he was just full of trickery and deceit.  Hello.  We got a letter from Yuki.  You just said hello into a banana.  It's a scream.  Every time it's a panic.  Yuki writes, dear President Obama, hello, my name is Yuki, and I'm from Japan, and I have lived in New York since 2006. 
[01:16:30]  Now I'm greatly concerned about our earth.  We use a lot of energy and gas in our daily life.  We also cut down trees and experience air pollution, so I insist that we save the energy for our future.  I believe you can change the world.  Yes, we can.  I'm really glad to hear that you became the president of the United States.  I'm very concerned about the environment and the fuel.  That's good.  What's the gas dam?  $33 a barrel?  Yep, $70 a gallon.  Burn it. 
[01:17:00]  Burn it.  Let's go to Matt in Jersey.  Matt.  Hey, how you doing, Opie?  I wanted to agree with you.  When you're 70, you don't know for crap what you're going to vote for, you know?  Hey, they're just following their parents.  We all just followed our parents until what age?  Like, maybe you started around 12?  Realized the way I could get my own interest going?  Thirteen?  Yeah, like, thirteen the music started and, like, it kicked in, you know?  Yeah.  All right, thanks.  Punch it out.  I remember when I was, like, eight, my dad ate lima beans, so I decided I like lima beans. 
[01:17:30]  Ew.  Let me tell you something.  Lima beans suck.  Horrible.  And I knew it at the time, but it was like...  Mealy things.  But I wasn't old enough to have an opinion yet, and I felt this would get me closer to dad,  and so my mom would make one can of lima beans, and it would be for Greg and dad, and everyone  looked at me like, ugh, effing brownos.  Brownos.  Brownos.  And then I would sit there and eat these horrendous lima beans, making believe I ate them.  Uh, I liked them.  Yeah.  And then one day, my mom's like, I got your lima beans for you and dad, and I think I 
[01:18:00]  let my dad down.  I'm like, I don't like lima beans.  They suck.  And then I realized, whoa, I'm finally getting a voice for myself.  Lima beans taste like earwax with a soft toenail around them.  It's horrendous.  Aren't they terrible?  It is probably the worst thing you can eat, but I may believe.  But then my brothers followed suit, and my dad liked to eat chicken ass.  You know, that little, like, the...  Yeah.  Sure.  You see the chicken?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It has that weird little chicken ass that just sticks out. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  He would chop it off and then dig in, and then we all decided, yeah, we like chicken ass,  too.  Did you want to be like dad when, uh, isn't that like the tail?  It's like triangular shape.  Yeah, we used to call it the chicken ass, but I think it was just kind of the tail that  would kind of protect the, uh, you know what.  Yeah.  And we, uh, we ate that, too.  And then you grow up...  I got that in school once when we were having chicken.  It's disgusting.  And I started crying.  Yeah.  But then you realize...  Maybe our dad was just, uh, testing us.  Because then you grow up, get a little older, and you realize, why? 
[01:19:00]  When you got the white meat and the legs and everything else, why would you eat the chicken  ass?  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Let's say hi to Billy in Connecticut.  Billy.  Yeah.  Hey.  For me, it was black licorice.  My father, you see black licorice all the time, and I hated it.  And he was like, oh, do you like it?  And then one day I said yes, by mistake.  That's all I ever got, black licorice constantly.  Yeah.  Is that what you wanted to say?  I thought you wanted to say... 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, the letters that you read.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How come the white children didn't mention the fact that he was Afro-American?  Only like the first couple letters when you were reading them.  And then all of a sudden, it was like...  Well, this is very racial.  This whole situation is extremely racial.  I know.  It's a good exercise.  Well, no.  White kids don't see color.  It's because he's just the president.  He's not our Afro-American president.  He's our president.  Yeah.  All right.  He's the first black president.  No.  To black people, this is a very big thing.  All right.  Let's go to Rocky. 
[01:20:00]  It's another just...  It's supposed to be another inauguration of another president.  But to black people, this is a pilgrimage, a holy pilgrimage to D.C.  to watch this historic thing, blah, blah, blah, whatever.  And all it does is more divide.  It's more divisive than my stupid talking.  All right.  Let's say hi to Rocky.  How long are you?  Rocky.  Hey.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Dear Obama, I hope you do well as president. 
[01:20:30]  Your grandson, Frank.  Got a joke there with old pals with earphones might come and see me.  I think Frank would have a different tone to his letter.  Who are you kidding?  Anthony in Brooklyn, age seven.  That was Anthony from Long Island.  My name is Anthony.  I go to blah, blah school.  I'm in the second grade.  Hard to read this one.  Come on, you wop.  Say something good.  Yeah.  I would like to make a special request to you.  Huh?  I want my cousins...  Aff off and watch. 
[01:21:00]  I want my cousins to come home.  They're in Iraq.  Oh, see.  You're a troublemaker.  Their names are Puro and Elena.  I want to play with them again.  I miss them a lot.  Please bring them home very soon from Anthony.  Looks like he's Spanish or Puerto Rican or whatever.  Spanish something.  All right.  And finally, little Elena, age seven, from Peekskill, New York.  Looks white.  It was great that they picked you as the new president. 
[01:21:30]  I hope you're the best president.  I hope you find a nice dog for your daughters.  I hope you have a great holiday.  Have a great time being the president.  Merry Christmas.  Yeah, it seemed pretty nice.  All cute, nice, right?  Little kids.  So stupid.  We all are, though.  Because kids don't know anything about taxes.  What did you think you liked as a kid because maybe your parents liked it?  Yelling.  I drank food at the wall. 
[01:22:00]  Was there something, though, you were like, was there like something you ate or like you  did just because dad did it or your mom did it or an uncle did it?  Drink.  There's nothing.  I don't have a happy thought from my childhood.  There ain't a one.  Not a one.  There ain't a one.  Every day was nothing but yelling and arguing between moms and pops and me crying in the  middle.  Ooh, ah. 
[01:22:30]  Stop it.  I have a bellyache.  Ew.  Someone take the attention off of the fight because I have a tummy ache and you have to  now help me to stop the fighting.  Ugh.  Are you embarrassed that that's how you acted?  Oh, yeah.  Not now.  Now I could give a crap.  That kid's long dead.  That kid's gone.  You cried by having a tummy ache just so that they'd stop fighting?  Yeah, I would say I have a tummy ache or I'd come inside and say I think I broke my arm.  I'd say something like just to try to stop them from fighting. 
[01:23:00]  I hate him.  I'd like to sock you right in your larynx.  Oh, believe me.  With my hog.  It might help.  It was just, I was such a pathetic, like, little tyke.  At that age, you feel kind of like trapped and you'll do anything just to try to keep  the peace and...  It was such a bad move.  Such a bad play.  I couldn't see right through it.  Shut up.  Your little mind was trying, though. 
[01:23:30]  My dad would yell at mom that I was being a little fag.  Because I was crying.  Yeah.  And then mom would try to stick up for me.  And they'd keep arguing.  Oh, Jesus.  My boyfriend had to leave.  That's a bad joke.  There's nothing worse than when a fag joke gets a swing and a miss.  Oh, wow.  Let's go to Tiffany in Queens.  Tiffany, she's... 
[01:24:00]  Hi, guys.  It says she's black.  I guess it's important to the phone call.  So, Tiffany, go ahead.  All right.  Hi.  I just wanted to say, like, I understand why it's so important to...  Like I said, it's not as important to me because I'm younger.  I'm only 31.  And so I didn't have to live through all that stuff.  But my mom grew up in the South.  She protested with hoes down, stuff like that.  So for her to see this and her lifetime having come from that, I get why it's such a big  deal for them, especially the older black people, you know? 
[01:24:30]  Do you think this came out of nowhere, though?  I mean, honestly, this didn't come out of nowhere where all of a sudden your grandmother  is getting hoes down and then there's a black president.  There was a progression of achievements that black people made that brought them to this  point.  And my whole point has been that because of this and because of those achievements, it's  very difficult for a working white person to sit there and listen to bitching and moaning 
[01:25:00]  about money and whitey and lack of opportunity.  But guess what?  That's difficult for a working black person here, too.  My mom was a scientist.  She has two masters backwards.  But how to hear people complain when she went through all that because they're not doing  anything, that's hard for her, too.  It's not just working like she's with anyone working.  You know what I'm saying?  It's difficult for anyone who has to work to get where they belong to hear people complain, 
[01:25:30]  you know, and then say, oh, I don't get it.  My mom never blamed anyone for her things that didn't work out for her.  But it's still important because that doesn't negate the fact that, you know, we are where  we are now.  All right.  You sound sensible, like you got a good head on your shoulders there, Tiffany.  I hope so.  I'm a teacher.  Oh, are you?  Right on, Tiffany.  All right.  At Obama High School? 
[01:26:00]  Hold on.  I'm just looking at Edie Amin on Channel 11.  Oh, my God.  I know.  Who is that awful woman?  You will come with me.  You will be my doctor.  She's terrible.  Yeah, I guess they're doing Michelle Obama makeovers on WPIX here in New York.  So they're doing and taking women of color and putting them in Michelle Obama clothes  and putting the makeup on.  And then the other one, yes, is an Edie Amin. 
[01:26:30]  The woman in the chair.  Makeover.  She's horrendous.  She has a perfectly fat, round head.  It's almost like a big dark egg.  She has a horribly shaved head.  Come on.  Show Edie again.  Not you.  The one from the Michelle Obama makeover.  I want...  God damn it.  Turn on Channel 11 with the volume off and just wait for Edie Amin to pop back on.  She's a real hoot.  That woman was horrible.  Let's go to Francesca in New York. 
[01:27:00]  Francesca.  Hi.  Hey.  I was calling up because you were talking about what kind of things kids pick because  of.  And I have a four-year-old class and they were picking, you know, which president they liked  better.  And we had a weekly reader about, you know, what the president's favorite foods were and  what their favorite books were.  And when I had the boxes out, I had a red box and a blue box.  And some of them picked, you know, Obama because his box was red.  And my favorite color is red.  And, you know, the other one would have picked McCain because his favorite food was chili. 
[01:27:30]  And he's like, hey, chili, too.  I'm going to pick you to home again.  And it was so funny because when Obama won in our class or whatever, some of them are  emotional and they're four.  So one of them was crying because he wanted McCain to win.  And it's just, it's funny because I think it's, you know, whoever their parents like, too.  And I guess, you know, since Obama's box is red and Neil's favorite color is red, then  that's what we expect.  It's just a four-year-old's mind how it goes. 
[01:28:00]  There you go.  Thank you, Francesca.  Let's say how did Chris and Milford.  Chris.  Yeah, she just said that her mom had two masters.  I think she meant degrees.  Oh, okay.  I guess she has come a long way.  All right.  Smart ass.  Let's go to Dan in Detroit.  Dan?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I'm hoping Obama will be president now that, I hope it inspires these people to get off  welfare now and maybe stop bucking the system, stop having kids that they can't pay for, 
[01:28:30]  or maybe start going and finishing their education, maybe learning the language, too, I was hoping.  I don't know.  That's just my thought.  Start passing out the Rosetta Stone English in the community.  They're saying there's close to a quarter million people already there, and this ain't even  happened for another four or five hours.  They said over 100, I think 20,000 people rode the Metro in the first two hours of service  today.  More than 200.  They're arriving by the thousands. 
[01:29:00]  Jesus.  Amazing.  What was the biggest crowd for inauguration?  Do they have that figure?  I don't know.  It doesn't get up to a million, does it?  Ever?  This will blow it around.  I think for Bush's second, they had 600 people.  All right.  We'll take a quick break.  We'll continue.  Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Moving right along with the Opie and Anthony show.  We say hi to Stryker.  You got something for the show?  877-212-ON-A.  Stryker, what do you got?  Hey.  Morning, boys. 
[01:29:30]  Good morning.  I have a letter to President Obama.  All right.  Dear President Obama, my name is Jim.  I'm 40 years old.  My mommy voted for you.  My daddy said mommy is an N-lover.  Mommy said daddy preps bull.  What is an N-lover and what does it mean to prep a bull?  Your friend, Jim.  Matt in Alabama writes, 1.2 million at LBJ's second term inauguration is the standing record according to the History Channel. 
[01:30:00]  I am.  Obama blows that away today.  Well over 1.5 expected.  Oh, hell yeah.  I don't know how it's going to push 2 million.  I don't know where they go.  All the way to Baltimore?  It's a big day down there in D.C. 
[01:30:30]  And I don't know.  I guess I'm going to have to watch, you know, because I'm a journalist.  Yes, you are.  I'm part of the media.  Yeah.  So I'll watch it.  You don't want to watch it though, right?  No, it's sort of like salt in the wounds kind of a thing, you know.  I'm not a big, sorry, I'm not a big Obama fan.  I'm not as whipped up in this like the media likes to show everybody. 
[01:31:00]  Boy, they are just showing everyone.  You would think this guy got 100% of the popular vote.  Unbelievable.  How about just show a couple of people that aren't that happy?  And I don't mean politicians, I mean you're average Joe.  Yeah.  You're Joe the Plumbers.  Ugh.  But, no, according to the media, everyone is just in love with this guy. 
[01:31:30]  Countdown to change.  That was my favorite one I heard today.  Countdown to change.  What does that mean?  That sounds ominous, doesn't it?  It's going to try to change a few things.  There's a countdown and then stuff changes?  Well, the countdown to change means, you know, he officially starts.  Even though he's been our president for the last, like, what, two and a half months.  Of course.  No one was paying attention to Bush ever since the election was over.  Well, truth of the matter is.  The change begins, what, later today, I guess. 
[01:32:00]  It's going to be nice to hear him have to comment on a lot of things.  Mm-hmm.  Jesus.  The guy wouldn't comment on anything.  On the war, on Israel, and the Palestinians.  He's commented on the economy.  That's pretty much it.  But not even in detail.  It'll be nice for them to go, hey, Mr. President, give us an answer on this.  Well, we'll start that.  And watch him try to get his way out of it. 
[01:32:30]  You got Jim Brown down there.  Things are good, see?  What?  The legend, Jim Brown.  How the hell is that racist doing?  Good old Jim Brown is down.  Wow, look at those people.  Two hundred thousand.  Holy mackerel.  There's two hundred thousand in there.  Wow, it's past the Washington Monument, if you know that whole area.  And they're just filling in.  Holy mackerel.  What else is going on?  What do we got? 
[01:33:00]  Nothing of any importance today.  That's the big story, the election inauguration.  What?  Oh, I thought we'd have another shot.  I thought we had another chance at electing somebody else.  No.  No.  Let's say hi to Michelle in Boston.  Michelle.  Michelle, my bell.  Hey, how's it going?  What's going on, Michelle?  I voted for Obama.  Mm-hmm.  But this is overkill, man.  It is everything and everywhere.  And the money that they're spending on this? 
[01:33:30]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  I mean, it's ridiculous.  And you can't escape it.  So, yeah, you're probably going to have to watch it because it's everywhere.  Yeah, there's really no getting away from it.  No.  And put a movie in.  Whatever, man.  It's part of history today.  Yeah, I agree.  $170 million.  Yeah, it's a lot of money.  That's a lot of dough.  That's good.  And they party for, what, four or five days?  Sure.  I don't disagree that he's the right guy for the job, but... 
[01:34:00]  Huh?  Let them be happy today.  Yeah, there's a lot of happiness around Washington today.  Who gives a hoot?  I don't disagree.  I think he's the right guy for the job.  I just think that this has been blown so far out of proportion.  All right.  Well, it's a little different this time around, that's all.  Mike in New York.  Mike.  Hey.  Hey, Mike.  Yo.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  Listen, Anthony was just saying, what is countdown to change?  Yeah.  That's what's going to be left out of his paycheck after Obama implements his tax laws. 
[01:34:30]  The change.  It's countdown to just, oh, you mean, like, literally change.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll have some nickels and dimes.  Very good.  Hey, Mike.  Finally, somebody with a little sense.  Let's go to John in North Carolina.  John.  Hey, whoever called and said LBJ's second term was the record, he didn't have a second term.  He did not seek, nor would he accept.  That's right.  The famous quote. 
[01:35:00]  So what is that guy talking about?  He's an idiot.  He's an idiot.  We got punged.  Did you get the real answer there, Stump Brain?  No one picked up on that, by the way.  Huh?  I saw the, you know, MSNBC.  MSNBC has the same stats as that it was LBJ's 1965 inauguration.  So did they have an inauguration?  Well, didn't he?  I mean, he finished out Kennedy's. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  And he was sworn in on the plane.  And then he had his own, but that wasn't officially a second term.  It was a full first term.  That would be his first term.  Ah, is that how that works?  I guess that's how it works.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Because he was in there for more than, he was in there for.  He was in there until like 68.  Yeah.  So he did six years or almost six years.  And it technically was a second term, if you want to get down to it.  No, that's what I was, okay.  Who was it?  LBJ?  Yeah.  So it was 1.2, and then Eisenhower was three quarters of a million.  But that's the year.  All right.  Let's go to John in Connecticut. 
[01:36:00]  John.  Yeah, I just don't understand how Anthony, first of all, Anthony, I love you, by the way.  Thank you.  I think you're hilarious, and I think you're very smart, too.  But you seem like you're being unbelievably selfish in this whole situation.  Like, is it just the taxes that bother you, or is there, I mean, obviously, I know you  don't like him because he's black, but, you know, I mean, what else is it, though?  You see, people have a misconception that I don't like him because he's black.  I don't like the way black people are treating this guy like the Messiah. 
[01:36:30]  That's all.  And, yes, I heard it a thousand times.  They will be gravely disappointed with his lack of magical powers.  But, in the meantime, there are things going on that I think should be addressed that are  not being addressed because Obama president, nah.  That's all.  But, I mean, you know, there's so much wrong with the country right now. 
[01:37:00]  I think that you keeping your money, you know, if you don't have a job in, you know, six months  through a year or two years because this country has completely fallen apart, then you not  getting taxed is not going to make a difference.  Dude, I've risked not having a job since I got into radio.  I've not had a job at times when I've been to radio.  It's, you know, it's kind of a weird business to look at like that.  But if you're talking about somebody that's working and then isn't working and isn't going 
[01:37:30]  to be able to pay taxes, I can understand that.  But upping the taxes ain't going to help.  But he's an intelligent, well-spoken, very diplomatic guy who seems at least on the surface  to be a thinker.  I mean, he's so much better than anybody.  I'm 33 years old.  He's better than anybody I've seen in my lifetime.  It's not about, it's not so much about Obama.  He's going to be a black guy, which I think is a very good thing for this country racially 
[01:38:00]  and socially.  It divides, it divides more than unites, my friend.  It is dividing more than it's uniting.  People are blind not seeing this.  Black people are looking at this like we're finally getting ours.  Meanwhile, they've been getting theirs for years and years and years as they get more  and more opportunity because of their groups with letterheads that fire off letters when 
[01:38:30]  Imus says something bad.  Believe me, they've been getting their rights that are due them and using them in, I don't  know, ways that aren't as productive as they should be.  Using them as a let's get back, let's get back at the white man instead of let's elevate  ourselves.  That's what I'm seeing.  I agree with that to some extent, but in the same hand, there's also going to be those  people who are just trying to make it and come up and they're saying, you know what, 
[01:39:00]  there is a good possibility.  Like, I don't have to be a schmuck and sell drugs and do X, Y, Z. I can actually become,  you know, somebody in this country.  I think there's going to be as many of those people that are affected positively by this  as there are people that are negatively affected in the way that you're mentioning.  If you are right and that happens, God bless.  But I sure don't see it.  I see, I see, I see...  I think some of that will happen.  I agree. 
[01:39:30]  He's a great role model for a lot of people that are going to, like, see this a little  differently and they're going to try to make their selves better.  That absolutely is going to happen.  Will the other thing happen that you're talking about?  Yes.  Absolutely.  There's going to be people that are going to, like, make themselves better because he's  a role model.  Definitely.  People that are on the streets gangbanging, killing, dealing drugs, they're going to  turn around because this guy is now a president.  Well, you guys are a lot more open-minded, much more general terms than that. 
[01:40:00]  Well, that's just my point is that I think you need to open your mind a little bit about  this situation and see that, look, there's going to be negative aspects to it, but I think  overall, I think the positives that are going to come out of this situation are far greater  than the negatives that are going to end up being.  Look, for the last eight years, it hasn't worked the way we've been running.  I mean, we're in the worst debt.  Our country's a mess.  Globally, we look like idiots.  I mean, you know, we're about to, like, flip it around. 
[01:40:30]  It's something new.  Maybe it's not going to be perfect.  We'll see.  It's going to be different.  We will absolutely see.  You're right.  I do like the fact that the country, a lot of people are psyched about them.  I do kind of like that.  It's been a long time since people have been this psyched about a president, and I like  it.  I don't think it's a bad thing.  Absolutely.  It's a big pep rally, man.  I feel good about it just because people are excited about politics and things happening  for once.  It's not just, you know, everybody's an idiot.  I hate everybody above me, you know?  All right, John. 
[01:41:00]  Good phone call, John.  If people use it, like I said, to elevate themselves and look at this man that took himself up from  where black people were discriminated against, not today, and brought himself up to be president  of the United States, if people want to look at that and say, wow, I could do that too,  then it's probably one of the best things that's ever happened for the country.  But if it's payback for Whitey time, which because of past performance, I see that as indicative 
[01:41:30]  of future results.  That's what I've seen lately.  I don't see this great influence.  I see we're getting ours now.  That's what I see.  Let's say hi to Daniel in Oklahoma.  Daniel.  Hey, Anthony.  Hi, sir.  I said that this is going to divide us more than unite us.  Yes.  Just because you read n-wordmania.com doesn't mean that you have any legitimate scope on 
[01:42:00]  the view of the race in the century.  I read hard left, too.  You're a dumb tin-knocking guinea, and you need to shut up.  I read hard left stuff, too, my friend.  And I hate when they hang up.  I was a tin-knocking guinea for many years, and I worked hard for a living.  But now I'm just a radio guinea.  What is he talking about?  Let's say hi to Adam in Boston.  Adam. 
[01:42:30]  Hey, guys.  Lighter note.  We'll lighten everything up a little bit.  Yeah.  Now with a black president, shouldn't a giant asteroid be splashing down into the ocean any  day now?  That would be just our luck.  We finally get hit by that asteroid now.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to John in Brooklyn.  John.  Hey, man.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, John.  Hey, you know, these guys are coming on talking about, oh, I have faith in this guy, Obama.  He's going to save everybody.  He's going to make things better, turn drug dealers around.  These people have been sold dreams, and they're the same people that'll get scammed by a guy 
[01:43:00]  on the phone who's selling shit over the phone.  All they're doing is getting scammed.  This guy is surrounding himself with the worst people in history, the Clintons, Eric Holder.  He's not going to make the decisions.  All these crappy people that are around him are going to make the decisions, and they're  going to destroy things.  You'll see.  These people don't know what they're talking about.  You're going to hold yourself, sir.  You're panicking.  You're having a panic attack.  Yeah, because these people are panicking.  That's why. 
[01:43:30]  They need to get their heads on straight.  Simmer down, sir.  Are we going to start seeing, let me face a little question here.  Are we going to start seeing primarily black neighborhoods turn themselves around to where  people can walk around at night?  It's not just liquor stores with plexiglass in front of the people that sell things, lower  crime in those areas.  Is that what we're going to see? 
[01:44:00]  I don't know.  No, I do.  No, we're not.  I don't know why that's been perpetuated for as long as it has been.  Why are these neighborhoods piles of crap?  Why are minority neighborhoods crime ridden?  No productivity is coming out of them.  I heard black leadership bitch and moan about when white people, investors, came into Harlem 
[01:44:30]  and started building.  Gentrification.  Yeah, exactly.  And now Harlem is a tourist attraction in New York.  People that were afraid to go up there can now go up there and go to the Apollo Theater  and walk down these streets and check out the shops and local restaurants because of white  investors' dollars. 
[01:45:00]  And why couldn't that be done by black people looking with pride in their own neighborhood  and fixing it up?  Maybe it is being done more.  I don't know.  I don't have my pulse on the black plight.  I have no idea.  Look at some videos on YouTube.  There's plenty of people just driving down the streets of Detroit with video cameras.  Black guy driving down with his girlfriend.  I saw one.  And they're just videotaping hookers and homeless and crime and drug transactions and laughing 
[01:45:30]  at it.  And the guy is just bad-mouthing his bitch and talking all kinds of crap about drugs  and, oh, this area and this is mines and throwing up gang signs.  And it's like, why can't you, instead of looking like that, take the camera, turn around and  go, why do we live in this place?  Why do we live in a pile of crap?  And why can't we, as a community, get together and build this up to make it a neighborhood that 
[01:46:00]  people could be proud to live in, to visit, and that maybe the next Obama can come out  of?  Same reason that, like, a lot of, you know, when Bush gets elected or somebody else, people  in trailers don't do that?  Man, I don't see it like that.  I don't see going into a, you go into a trailer park, you'll probably hear a guy beating his  wife.  I'll give you that.  You might smell some crystal meth being cooked up somewhere. 
[01:46:30]  But it's a far cry from trying to walk the streets of Detroit.  Let's go to Fontaine.  Fontaine.  Good evening.  Good evening, Fontaine.  It's so funny yesterday that when you called, oh, I didn't know you were black.  I heard that.  No clue, man.  I was giggling.  No clue.  What a dummy.  Anthony, they beat the hell out of me yesterday.  I'm a black guy and I believe, I agree with you, Anthony, with everything you say, especially  the race issue, but you need to shut up because you go to the Mohegan Sun and sit there and 
[01:47:00]  lose $50,000, but you're worried about your tax money?  Yep.  Shut up.  Yep, I do because I've made money too and I've lost money.  But you know what that is called?  My goddamn entertainment with my money that I effing earned, dummy.  I don't want to have to give it away and let it be used by the government as they deem.  Look, I'll pay for roads. 
[01:47:30]  I'll pay for bridges.  That's what I do.  That's where my tax dollars go.  I'll even pay for a missile fin every so often if we've got to bomb somebody.  But I'm not going to pay for like Obama said so someone behind me can come up.  Do it yourself.  AJ.  Hey, morning, guys.  Good morning, AJ.  Yeah, I'm up for the change and everything.  I have hopes for this guy, but it's going to take a lot of time to unmatch this entire,  I don't even know if I can say it on the air, but abortion of a country right now. 
[01:48:00]  But I'm looking at the schedule.  When is he turning the water into wine again?  Because I can't find it on the schedule.  Punch it out.  Take care, guys.  I don't know why people are so shocked that a lot of people are kind of hopeful.  He's following an abominable presidency.  And I defended Bush at one point.  It's not like he's following this great time for us.  We're in a war that every one of us now, even those of us that were forwarded first, hate. 
[01:48:30]  We are despised around the world.  Some of that is completely unjustified.  Actually, most of it is.  And I say like, F the rest of the world.  Yeah.  And then there's other stuff where it's like, all right, I'm just sick and tired of the U.S. being hated.  You know what I mean?  It's like he's following a terrible presidency.  So why is everybody shocked that people are looking at this guy kind of hopeful?  He's a young, charismatic guy.  He doesn't seem like typical politics because he hasn't been this albatross in Washington for 25 years. 
[01:49:00]  He just popped up a few years ago.  People liked him.  And now all of a sudden, they got him elected president.  So maybe it makes people feel like, you know what?  You kind of come from out of nowhere and you can get elected.  He's not like one of the 50 bums that we get every year.  There's a giant racial divide in this presidency.  It's a billion.  It's giant.  Black and white is the race.  That's it.  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  We needed a black president eventually.  I think he's the guy to do it.  But I do think that it had to happen sooner or later. 
[01:49:30]  In our country, with the history between blacks and whites, I think it had to happen sooner or later.  And people can call me a flaming liberal, but look.  Well, now keep your mouth shut.  And people have jumped on me about that.  Oh, Anthony, you can't say now all black people have to keep their mouth shut because the president is now a black man.  Yes.  Yes, I can.  He's achieved the pinnacle, which means anyone can.  Clean up your streets.  Keep your neighborhoods clear.  If you're going to call the cops in because there's drug dealing going on in your neighborhood, 
[01:50:00]  don't then start throwing stuff at the police or bitching that they're there patrolling your neighborhood.  There's just little things that I think the black people in the black communities have to do to live up to the fact that the president is black.  The president shouldn't have to, because he's black, get down to your level.  And start fixing your crap.  You now have to look at the presidency with a certain amount of respect for your race and fix your crap. 
[01:50:30]  Clean up your own house.  That's what I see.  And I get looked at like I'm an idiot and a racist because I think that black people should take a little more pride in their neighborhoods, in their lifestyle, in their families, in whatever the hell it is that they're not doing.  And just because there's a black president doesn't mean that all that is fine and dandy anymore.  It doesn't mean that now you can still live like that and it's going to be looked at as okay.  It means look, look what he did. 
[01:51:00]  Now build yourself up and get to a point where maybe your son or daughter can be the president or a high position in politics.  I'm just sick of hearing it.  I'm sick of hearing that it's acceptable to live in a crap hole and blame others for it.  Well, having pride in the race because he's president, I mean, the argument.  They are.  Believe me, that's why bus loads are going down.  But I'm saying just as easily a lot of people could say, look, well, the president's white.  What about this abominable behavior being displayed?  And they're like different. 
[01:51:30]  You know what I mean?  It's like you're going to get that.  You're right, though.  You're right.  But it's not a racial thing with us, with a white president.  We don't look.  Yeah, it's the president.  I don't feel a racial bond with the president until I notice that he's not white.  That's what happens when you're the majority.  I'm not saying that it's what happens.  That's one of the perks of the majority is, and it's always been that way.  White people have been divvied up into, let me put it this way.  If Giuliani became president and one of his skeletons jumped out of his closet that when he was prosecutor, 
[01:52:00]  he had made some kind of a deal with some mob guy,  it would all be about guinea guinea, WAP, look at this, the Italians, they all stick together.  So it would be a racial thing.  Or ethnic, yeah.  Or ethnic, whatever you want to call it.  But Bush is such a just the waspy guy that you can't just look at him and go,  oh, all white people, all waspy white people, I'll give. 
[01:52:30]  Bush is lumped in financially.  Like Bush is lumped in with the elitist other white guy.  Yeah.  That's it.  And that's been said.  Oh, what, another old rich white guy?  You know, it has been lumped in.  People have said it.  So, and they have looked at him and looked at rich white people, the corporate leaders,  put them all in the same category.  That's what's going to happen with Obama if he tanks.  So, you know, I just think at this point with all this pride and all the buses going down 
[01:53:00]  and everybody just talking about like he's Jesus Christ, get your house in order.  Fix your own crap.  Don't blame anybody.  He's at the pinnacle of the free world.  Now it's your turn to work, to work and work and build yourself up and not wait for this  guy to, through retribution, build you up.  Fix your own crap.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We'll continue next.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:53:30]  Heading toward the finish line here.  Opie and Anthony, phones are lit.  Where do you want to go, Ant?  Oh, my God.  Well, what is bothering you?  Jay seems a little upset at me.  He's a trucker.  Line six.  What's up, Jay?  Hi, Jay.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  I want to know why Ant's being such a separatist.  I mean, this is a good time for the United States right now for us to try to get together  and actually come together. 
[01:54:00]  I was born from parents.  I went to segregated schools and went through the stuff in the 50s and 60s.  And to see this actually come through now is actually a good thing.  And, yeah, there is bad things going on in our neighborhoods.  And, yeah, some of our people don't have all our stuff together, but a lot of us do.  And as each generation goes on, we are going getting better.  And it's just a sign that we are getting better.  And Ant just wants to separate us from one from another. 
[01:54:30]  I'm not so much a separatist as just a realist.  I look around me.  I see what's going on.  I don't see a lot of real social interaction between black people and white people,  not as much as they show on television, in movies.  There isn't this genuine interaction between white people and black people.  And I think it's somehow basic human nature.  I don't know.  Fear.  I don't know what it is. 
[01:55:00]  But there isn't – when you see people hanging out together,  it's usually white people hanging with white people,  black people hanging with black people.  And the more – I guess the more into your race you are,  the less you really do communicate with the other side.  Like, I cannot even fathom hanging out with a hip-hop crowd,  some guys that are slinging dope, whatever. 
[01:55:30]  Even in my day of when I was, you know, not a real good law-abiding citizen,  I mean, I couldn't see that.  It's so alien to me that – and I'm sure my lifestyle is to the black community.  Apparently you don't drink Sonny D.  Yes, those Sonny D kids, they get along with everybody.  Brings everyone together.  I'm not so much a separatist as just this – the way we are today.  It's just the way it is.  And, I mean, on the real, it's not. 
[01:56:00]  I've seen more interactions between white and black.  Like, me, I'm a black guy.  I'm a drag racer.  I've got a couple of mud trucks I used to off-road.  I see more and more interactions between whites and blacks than anything else.  It's starting to drop a whole lot more than when my parents came up.  Well, of course.  Especially when they came in the South.  It will.  I'm just saying it's not there.  We're not there yet.  There's – I'm not a separatist as much as I'm just living my life the way people live their lives. 
[01:56:30]  We as a people, black people and white people, for the most part, do not socialize as much as is portrayed in TVs and movies.  And, you know, you're not – I don't know how to put it.  It's just the way it is.  It's look around.  I have to agree with you on one part.  It's not as much as you see in TVs and movies. 
[01:57:00]  But it's not as much as you're putting it out to be as us being, like, just divided down the middle.  By the way, everything you mentioned seems to be white-oriented activities.  That's why you see –  No.  Drag racing?  What?  Yes.  A black person in drag racing?  All right.  Thank you, Jay.  We're going to move on.  Let's say hi to Alan in the Bronx.  Alan, what's going on, buddy?  Alan.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I've been listening a long time.  Love you guys. 
[01:57:30]  And I want to know why it's okay for K-Rock to put Ginny over the air, but I've got to say the N-word when I call up.  Exactly.  You know why?  Punch it out, boys.  You know why?  Because that's how it is.  We agree.  I don't have an answer to that.  It's just because that's the way it is.  I could talk about my heritage and use terms that some people of my heritage would find repugnant.  I don't care, to tell you the truth.  When I'm called a WAP or anything, I find it funny.  It reminds me of watching The Godfather. 
[01:58:00]  I think because most white guilt isn't built around Italians or Irish or Jews.  It's built around blacks.  That's probably why.  You're right.  There's sickening.  White guilt is probably number one on my list for things I hate.  that I cannot stand this white guilt, this feeling that we owe a race of people something because of something that was done years ago that was acceptable behavior for many years until, you know, obviously people realized, hmm, shouldn't be doing this. 
[01:58:30]  But for years, that was just the way it was.  And how about, you know, concentrate on the slavery that still goes on today.  The genocide that's going on in Africa is abominable.  Concentrate on that.  Well, say hi to David in Hartsdale.  David, how are you?  Hey, I just wanted to say that I wonder if Obama was a Republican, would black people have voted for him in the masses? 
[01:59:00]  That's a good question.  I think so.  Colin Powell was a good example of a Republican that before he tainted himself by lying for George Bush at the United Nations was a prime example of a black candidate that would have been a viable black Republican candidate.  And I think he would have had a damn good shot of getting in.  But, you know, woulda, coulda, shoulda.  Yep.  All right.  Let's say we got some audio from Jay-Z.  Rectum.  And, you know, just a giant step in the right direction and hope, right? 
[01:59:30]  Because that's what I really was voted on that.  And that was the real reason I platformed, because above and beyond being a very intelligent guy in whatever politics may take place in these next four or eight years,  you know, the sense of hope that it gave everybody in America that we're all now included in the American dream was priceless.  All right.  Or that hope.  That we're all included in the American dream is priceless. 
[02:00:00]  All right.  Let's see what happens next.  I agree with that.  I don't know why I'm, like, so...  I could change some things around.  Who else do you want to go to here?  I just talk about things.  That's exactly what I was saying, by the way.  Who is that, Jay-Z?  Yeah.  That's exactly what I was saying, that it gives people hope and stuff, but it doesn't give people hope to bitch and complain.  It gives people hope to improve themselves, to improve their families, to clean up their neighborhoods, whatever it takes. 
[02:00:30]  To, you know, respect certain authorities.  I'm not saying all.  You question whatever you want, but respect certain authorities that are staying within their boundaries.  And live your life.  Where do you want to go next?  I don't want to be accused of...  To a frigging throat doctor.  Well, that would be nice.  Uh, no, no, go ahead.  Anywhere.  I'm fine.  Let's say hi to Jay on Long Island.  Jay!  Yo. 
[02:01:00]  Hey, Jay.  Hey, man.  Yeah, you know what I find so ironic about Anthony?  Mm-hmm.  That he's set up there, and he's trying to, like, be on his high horse and tell us to get our lives together.  Yep.  But what's so ironic is he drives the Escalade, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  You just like us, man.  That's my Italian heritage.  You need an Escalade.  You drive the Escalade.  You like to gamble.  You like to let teenage meth addicts stay at your house for the weekend.  Jay, let me tell you what the big... 
[02:01:30]  Gun-toting.  Let me tell you what the big difference is.  Gun-toting, right, exactly.  Let me tell you what the big difference is, Jay.  Describing a gangbanger.  I'm a licensed gun owner.  I mean licensed gun owner.  See, that's the big difference.  I don't have a trap in my Escalade for dropping my weapons, and I don't think I've ever sold drugs out of my car.  I think today is the start of...  We're going to see the destruction of the ranges.  Am I what?  Those guns are there for a reason, man.  I know you're just stacking them up for a reason, man.  Well, yeah, because if the assault weapons ban gets reinstated, I'm not going to be able to buy a lot of the guns that I really am a fan of shooting, so that's why I'm buying them. 
[02:02:00]  All right, man.  Can I say one more thing?  Sure.  Steven from Bayshore, you stink.  Oh, wow.  That's going to cause some problems right there.  The racial divide, that's what I'm talking about.  Steve from Bayshore, a nice, white, God-fearing Nazi, and a black man.  Can't get along.  Let's go to Greg in Oregon. 
[02:02:30]  Greg.  Hey, what's going on?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Love the book, man.  Thank you.  This whole Barack thing is overshadowing my special day.  Oh, yeah.  Anyway, I agree with you on a lot of things, man.  I'm not really racist, but I'm definitely prejudiced.  I mean, I think everyone is, anyone that says they're not, you know, in some shape or form is just a liar.  Yeah.  But on the same token, I think we all have, like, say, that friend that purposely goes out of their way to annoy you.  And it's kind of like the Barack thing right now. 
[02:03:00]  I think in a lot of cases, you know, people are just going off, you know, treating them like a messiah.  In some cases, just to annoy you, you know, and you let them, which just gives them the power over you, you know.  I mean, I don't like it any more than you do, but on the same token, I mean, yeah, I'll give the guy a chance, and, you know, all I can do at this point, you know, I drive a truck, I got four kids, and a mortgage.  I mean, I'm hoping things get better, you know.  Yeah, you know, I guess if you're destitute and you're living in a crappy neighborhood and something like this happens, it gives you reason to celebrate and feel good for, you know, a couple of months and everything. 
[02:03:30]  That's fine, but like I said, use it.  Use it to your advantage, and let's see what happens.  I think, and I've been called out on this so many times, I think black people today have more opportunity than they've ever had before and have made leaps and bounds within even the past couple of years than they ever have in history.  And instead of wasting that, I think it should be used to their advantage to, you know, make your whole communities better. 
[02:04:00]  Well, you know, I live in a decent neighborhood, I mean, but everyone around me works, you know.  You have the one truck driver call and say, you know, there's just a chosen few.  I mean, if that was the case that, you know, everyone was aspiring to do better and there was just a chosen few, they would do something with their neighborhood, you know.  I mean, I'm by no means wealthy, but I live in a decent home. 
[02:04:30]  I mean, my kids go to a good school and, you know, but everyone around me works, whether it's in a mill or driving truck.  In my case, I mean, it just doesn't seem to matter.  People strive to do better, and it shows in the neighborhood they live in.  Well, that's what, yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about.  Just, you know, take it, look at it, and use it to your advantage.  All right.  Thank you, Greg.  We're going to mop up next.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Getting ready to head over to Sirius XM Satellite Radio to continue the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:05:00]  Dr. Steve just texted me.  He's like, Jesus Christ, what is wrong with you?  You should give him a call.  Rolling down the phones here.  Spiro writes Obama's going to motivate his people.  Dave in Los Angeles, Obama's already going back on his promises.  I am.  Mike in Ohio, we hung up on him all morning, but he continues, so what the hell. 
[02:05:30]  Would that vote for Goldie Wilson?  No, Goldie ruined Hill Valley.  We all know that.  John in New York, this will create more problems than solutions.  Craig on Long Island, to use something to your advantage, don't you have to want to use it?  It's true.  Graham in PA, everyone is excited because politics are like sports.  And Garrett in New York.  They are now.  Nothing will change.  Always violence in the ghetto.  That will never change. 
[02:06:00]  As Bush leaves office, we've got a couple more of his Bushisms.  Bushism.  As yesterday's positive report card shows, children's do learn when standards are high  and results are measured.  Children's?  Children's do learn.  Children's do learn?  Uh-huh.  That's nice.  See why he mispronounces, too.  Oh, of course.  No question that the enemy has tried to spread sectarian violence. 
[02:06:30]  They use violence as a tool to do that.  There's a tool.  Well, sectarian must have been wrong.  That was a stretch.  The United States of America is engaged in a war against an extremist group of folks.  Hey, what are they called?  You're working hard to put food on your family.  It's my father.  He's working hard to put food on his family. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, he certainly accomplished that.  Wah, wah.  I'm crying.  Fool me once.  Shame on...  Shame on you.  If you fool me, we can't get fooled again.  Oh, my God.  That is the best one yet.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  That's all he was trying to say.  And he broke into a who song.  I thought you won't get fooled again. 
[02:07:30]  I thought Mayor Menino was the only dummy in politics as far as getting things wrong.  I'd like to stay here all day, but I gotta go to Vegas.  Something about what goes on there or stays there or something like that, you know?  Yeah, something like that.  Bush with a couple of hookers.  Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we.  They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we. 
[02:08:00]  We must never stop thinking about how best to defend our country.  Yeah, all right.  And neither do we.  Oh, what a full paw.  One more.  I know the human being and fish can coexist peacefully.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  He said that standing next to a vagina.  Oh, wow.  How do you make that happen? 
[02:08:30]  All right.  Are they going to start a music marathon here today?  Yes, they are.  Is there a theme to the songs today, Danny?  Inauguration.  Now, if I was the program director of this fine radio station and there's a black president going to be sworn in today,  I would imagine that the music would be selected very carefully, and they would get something going.  Maybe even have people go, guess what the theme is of this music marathon.  What do we got?  Well, to start things off, you have ACDC with Who Made Who. 
[02:09:00]  Uh-huh.  And then you'll have some Black Sabbath Iron Man.  Uh-huh.  Well, Black, so I guess Black Sabbath.  There you go.  That's pretty good, Mark.  Very good.  I'm with you on this one.  Who Made Who?  Yeah.  You want to know who the father is?  There you go.  So, Mark is thinking here.  It looks like you don't start to get into a theme until Good Times, Bad Times, Led Zeppelin.  Good Times, Bad Times.  See, this is Mark Chernoff.  He's a programming genius.  Very subtle.  Well, a couple more songs before the Good Times, Bad Times.  You're letting them off the hook there, Danny. 
[02:09:30]  Let's see.  Hitch a Ride, Boston.  Hitch a Ride to Washington.  This is Mark Chernoff.  My God.  And Last Kiss, Pearl Jam.  There's a reason he gets paid the big bucks.  That's it.  All right.  A music marathon is about to start in New York, and obviously there's a theme on this  very, very important day in history.  Yes, I travel to Miami.  Yeah.  That's a big day.  Have fun.  I'll see you soon.  You're at it.  And we continue. 
[02:10:00]  We continue.  Jimmy's off to Miami.  Hey, Jimmy.  I just got to communicate from Stuntbrae.  We just left there.  He says, oh, how'd the guys get the Larry King clip where he asked Diddy about Dr. King's  dream being fulfilled?  Well, apparently Diddy was awful and mispronounced fruition badly.  It was Larry with Seal, Diddy, and the mayor of Sacramento.  Check it out.  Maybe we can find that.  Also, XM is pushing a song today in honor of the inauguration. 
[02:10:30]  They seem to be very excited about this song down in D.C.  Let's see.  There's still a facility down there?  Yeah, barely.  But I guess it's a song called, oh, crap, where to go?  Getting way too much email today.  Something America?  Yeah, something America.  America's Song, I think it's called.  America's Song?  Well, that's a bold statement. 
[02:11:00]  Well, that's why we want to play it and get a little reaction from you and the people  out there.  That means it's everybody's song.  Right.  We'll decide if it's America's Song.  Yeah, we'll decide.  We'll decide for you.  Well, I think we can with the people.  Of course.  We're talking to the people.  We'll play it and we'll see if they think it's America's Song.  Yes.  The masses.  Does America have a song?  Star Spangled Banner, maybe?  Yeah, we have official songs, but unofficially, I think.  What would be the official America's Song?  Even though no matter what song you pick, there are going to be people that go, that 
[02:11:30]  ain't my song.  The National Anthem.  The National Anthem would be America's Song.  Yeah.  So the song we're going to play in a little while is just as good as the American, the  National Anthem.  It's America's Song.  America's Song.  It's going to be.  High expectations.  All right.  I think, what's the unofficial one?  Like, God Bless the USA or something?  I don't know.  God Bless America, maybe.  Yeah, maybe God Bless America.  I think people wanted God Bless America as our National Anthem because they don't like  the whole militaristic version of our National Anthem with the bombs bursting in air. 
[02:12:00]  That's what the dude saw.  That's what happened.  Wasn't he in prison or something?  I don't know.  I think he was in some kind of fort.  Fort or something, and he was just writing about what he saw.  The flag was still there.  Why do we have to change the words?  Yeah, to make it less militaristic.  Because that came out a few years back.  We need to change the words.  Yeah, sorry that this country was kind of built on war.  Right.  You can't change that. 
[02:12:30]  You know what?  The Bush thing is going so well.  We're going to do a few more Bushisms.  Of course, his last day was, what, yesterday?  Imagine he did something just horrific late last night or early this morning.  Why wouldn't one president do that for the coup?  All right.  Is this a real Dr. Dre song?  The day the niggas took over?  What is this?  It's a Dr. Dre song. 
[02:13:00]  I thought that might be America's theme song.  Oh, shit.  Did he record that a while ago?  Uh, man, I think that's off of The Chronic.  You might know it, but you got it.  Let's take a listen.  The Chronic.  I'm going to say this and I'm going to end mine.  If you ain't down for the Africans here in the United States, period, point blank.  If you ain't down for the ones that suffered in South Africa from apartheid and shit.  Damn it, you need to step your fuck ass to the side. 
[02:13:30]  And let us brothers and us Africans pull down here.  If I'm going to put some foot in that ass.  I'm going to scare us, man.  I got my finger on the trigger.  So niggas wonder why.  We're living in the city.  It's who wants to die.  I got my finger on the trigger.  So niggas wonder why.  We're living in the city.  It's who wants to die.  Them wonder women valid.  Them don't really understand.  The reason why they take me lock in me on hand. 
[02:14:00]  They not out of place.  They may not ride the cake.  They gun goes click.  They gun goes bang.  Them rioting comes in.  And them rioting don't reach.  Them rioting and niggas.  Them don't really want to see.  Niggas start to loot.  Them police start to shoot.  Lock them down at 7 o'clock.  Barricade us like Beirut.  Make don't show no love.  Because it's supposed to get them.  Them never ever love me.  Because of course, just read them.  And kill at my own risk.  Them five-eight.  Delay to spray with my AK.  And pull up the red.  Yes, we have.  They're riding. 
[02:14:30]  Well, I don't want to say riding.  But they're looting downtown.  But right now, what I want to show you is.  They got started fires down at the end of the street.  How many people are ready to do?  See, when people ask me what I'm scared of.  It's this?  Yeah.  This is your nightmare?  That's pretty much it.  This is my ultimate nightmare.  So I was recorded yesterday.  So very timely by Dr. Dre.  That's actually live from D.C.  Yeah, as it's happening.  Hey, Justin from...  That's what Obama's walking on to. 
[02:15:00]  Justin from Hoboken.  Hoboken.  Hey, Opie.  Did you see that Orbicast is reporting that SiriusXM will be raising subscription rates,  including no longer making online streaming free?  Really?  Wow.  Really?  Got to make the money, huh?  Wow.  That's a tough one.  Got to make the money.  Because a lot of people pay for their sub.  But then, you know, they want to listen at work.  So they go...  Yeah, I noticed a lot of people listen to Satellite outside of their cars. 
[02:15:30]  Right.  You know?  So if they're listening online, sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Someone's saying Matt and Trey's America Fuck Yeah is the official song of America.  Do we have that song yet?  America's Song?  It's coming.  It's coming.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Can't wait.  Let's say hi to Tom in Chicago.  Tom.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Good.  What's up? 
[02:16:00]  I just really want to point out that everyone else in the media is basically saying that as  of Obama's inauguration, Martin Luther King's dream has been met.  And all I wanted to point out is Anthony is more closely parroting what Martin Luther King was  saying in 1963 than anyone else in the media in that day that we, in order to get it closer  between the races between the races and between the people, everyone's streets need to be kept up, everyone's existence needs to be closer to each other's existence. 
[02:16:30]  And that's really my interpretation of what Anthony is saying.  And I don't view him as a racist at all.  Well, it's merely the fact that's what Martin Luther King's dream was, not finally we have a black dude as president.  Yeah.  It's just the beginning.  A lot of people do misinterpret what the good Dr. King meant.  The great.  Yes, the great Dr. King.  A lot of them misinterpret what he even meant. 
[02:17:00]  Like, he did mean that.  Pick yourselves up.  Clean up your own communities.  Have pride in what you do and your families and everything.  And for some reason, and that was the whole, you know, content of character and not color of skin line.  But it's just turned into, like, he symbolizes this thing that doesn't mean what he was saying anymore. 
[02:17:30]  Very strange.  People may call you a racist, but I just want to point out, I think you've got the interpretation of what he meant down better than anyone.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  I really wanted to go to the next call, but he couldn't wait.  He wanted to know if you think Bush left a floater for Barack in the White House.  That's funny.  Trying to bring a little comedy back to the show.  Maybe an upper-decker.  You've got to go upper-decker on that.  Every toilet in the White House.  I would wait, like, a week and just start leaving him. 
[02:18:00]  Do you remember when Clinton left the White House and Clinton's people just fucked up the whole place for Bush?  There was a lot of stories, if you want to Google that, where they just almost destroyed the place.  Yeah, they were, like, writing on the walls.  They removed the W from all the keyboards on the computers for his middle name.  They were trying to have a little fun, but it went a little too far.  It really was a big deal eight years ago.  I wonder if they're doing that same type of...  Well, I guess we'll find out maybe later, today or tomorrow, what the Bush administration did. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, I don't think...  You can only imagine.  They could do some real nasty things.  You can only imagine.  There's got to be, like, one, like, hardcore racist in there that's going,  You know what?  What the hell?  I'm doing this.  One asshole who thinks he's being funny.  Like, the guys that don't know...  Like, every year or so, some group decides it's a good idea to do a black-to-the-future float or, you know, dress up like that.  Right.  And they're like, what?  We were just having fun.  Just having a good time.  That'll be somebody in the White House that decides to scrawl something on a wall or perhaps, you know, hang something up. 
[02:19:00]  You ready for America's song?  Am I?  I don't even know if...  It's our song.  I don't know if we can give serious credit for this.  I think this is an XM thing.  Really?  Because they said, they were bragging that it was recorded down in Washington.  And Oprah made a big deal of this song, I believe.  Did she?  It's called America's Song.  This is for everybody.  Everybody.  So clear the lines, because we want people to get, you know, comment about this song, because it's everybody's song now.  I'm just clearing the phones for now. 
[02:19:30]  All right, here it is.  America's Song.  According to accent.  Wait.  It's a karaoke.  You're standing at the screen waiting for it to start.  I knew it was a matter of time.  Blue Heeler from Kentucky.  Bush's administration should remove all the end keys from all the keyboards.  Oh.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Wow.  That would stir up some shit.  I do believe. 
[02:20:00]  Well, that came in from Dogshit Sniffer, too.  We'll give double credit on that one.  Joey, Hoverboard from East Hampton.  Black sheets on all the beds.  Oof.  Oof.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I said just leave the white ones on.  Oops.  Just cut some holes in the pillowcases.  It's like yours.  Now, someone's saying that Clinton story isn't true.  It was absolutely true they fucked up the White House a bit. 
[02:20:30]  It was only AP.  It has to be.  Elliot.  Yeah.  That story's true.  No, it isn't.  It's a complete fabrication.  It was proved to be falsed by the General Accounting Office.  Well, you know how that General Accounting Office is.  You know, that's the investigative arm.  What a nerd you are.  See, I'll tell you what happened.  Yeah.  What happened was the idiots in the White House with Karl Rove thought it would be a great idea  if they fabricated a story about how bad the Clinton people were.  But it was total bullshit.  Because what happened next was the Republicans in Congress said, hey, we've got to investigate this. 
[02:21:00]  So they said, hey, General Accounting Office, which is their investigatory arm,  they went and started subpoenaing people and getting depositions.  And they couldn't find any proof.  The only thing that they left were signs, like, outside some of the offices that were easily taken off,  like Office of Strategery, you know, Offices of Sublimitable Communications.  I mean, it was total, you know. 
[02:21:30]  Well, isn't that messing with the White House?  Yeah.  So maybe it wasn't as crazy as was reported.  Crazy.  All right, thank you.  You're listening to NPR.  Thanks for the call, Elliot, from Atlanta.  Nerd Radio for the masses.  Here's America's Song.  From Delaware to Tennessee to Hawaii.  From Mountain.  What?  What was that first lyric?  Shoehorning.  Do we have the words?  Listen to the words. 
[02:22:00]  Words, man.  From Delaware to Tennessee to Hawaii.  Hawaii?  Dude.  Hawaii?  From Delaware to Tennessee to Hawaii.  That's not even a shoehorn in.  That's one of those shoe trees that stretch your shoes out.  Oof.  This is, we're off to a good start with this.  America's Song.  From Delaware to Tennessee to Hawaii.  From mountain tops, we have dreamed from the sea to shining sea. 
[02:22:30]  And now here we are.  Here we are.  We have come.  We have prevailed.  Whosoever dreams, this is your will.  Here we are.  Here we are.  At the dawn and the morning of a brand new. 
[02:23:00]  New day.  A brand new day.  For all.  For all.  For all.  In the spirit of our fathers.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  America.  I like to be inspired.  This is horse shit.  That sucks a dick. 
[02:23:30]  Why aren't people that are live right now on satellite radio that have been handed this song go, wow, this sucks.  It stinks.  It's force inspiration.  Sounds like you're shoehorning the fuck out of it.  It's like cruise ship singers.  This thing stinks.  Wow, it is bad.  Oh, man.  But the email's going around all over the place.  Oh, my God.  If you're live, you've got to play America's Song.  Get behind it.  It's unbelievable.  It's really inspirational.  Is it? 
[02:24:00]  Whitney Houston at the Super Bowl singing was pretty fucking cool and inspirational.  This is more shit.  She was doing crack.  America, America, it's beautiful, yes it is.  My America, your America, America, it's beautiful. 
[02:24:30]  And my God, my God, keep on together.  Because America, America, is beautiful, yes.  Bang, bang.  It's a trotting, plodding piece of shit.  Right.  Trying way too hard to get an emotional idea. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  Trying way too hard.  I smell bit.  We've got a lot of musicians out there.  I smell shit.  Yeah, but I smell bit.  Our listeners could come up with America's Song.  America's Song.  Our listeners are ready to take on the challenge and come up with America's Song.  A theme song for our nation.  That's all I'm saying.  You go wherever the fuck you want with it.  But I say you try to come up with America's Song. 
[02:25:30]  Yes.  Because this thing stinks.  Now the guy's trying to sound like Bono.  Because everyone knows he's inspirational, right?  This is terrible.  You hear the Bono fucking attempt there?  And the music itself is horrible.  It probably is Bono.  Do we know?  Is it Bono?  Get the fuck out of here. 
[02:26:00]  Was it Bono?  It sounds like a bad Bono, but it really is Bono.  That was Bono.  Get the fuck out of here.  Shit, that's funny.  Dude, I swear to God.  Joe's Bono sounds better than the real Bono in this one.  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  Wow, do I look stupid.  It's like a We Are The World thing, huh?  Yeah, they're trying to move it over.  Who are the other two fucking people on there that we were listening to?  I would go with Mary J. Blige.  Blige.  Mary J. Bilge.  Faith Hill Bono, Mary J. Blige, Seal, and Will.I.Am from the Black Eyed Peas. 
[02:26:30]  Holy shit, man, if you come up with an American song, you're going to kick the ass of some  fine musicians.  Good call on the bad Bono.  That's funny.  I swear to God.  Dude, the guy's trying to do a Bono impression.  Everyone is nailing me, too.  That's funny.  Everybody.  And I'm a, you know, a lot of people laugh when I say this, but I definitely am a U2  fan, and I didn't even recognize that was the real Bono.  And, like, how many fucking actual Americans are singing this fucking America song?  How do you sing it?  You need to get three or four of your buddies together to take parts. 
[02:27:00]  But how many of them are the fucking, you know, Bono's from Ireland.  Right.  Seal's, what, English?  Yeah.  Just think about your own fucking shitty country.  Libar's alone.  Sounds like they got Bono after a bender.  Yeah.  Bono's like, all right, what the fuck, I'll give you a few.  Too many Guinness.  Now, I've got to go back.  Listen, this is the real Bono.  I had no idea until right now.  Let liberty and justice ring for all.  Let your dreams stand tall. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  May opportunities fall upon you.  Land of the free.  We have come and we have a friend.  Well, whosoever grieves, this is your way.  And here, here we are.  Here we are.  Let the star and horizon of a brand new day. 
[02:28:00]  Of a brand new day.  Brand new day means, you know, today.  That's what they mean.  Wow.  It's a brand new day.  So it's all going to be different tomorrow.  Look, A for effort.  Jesus Christ, please.  A for effort, but this is, this, they spent ten minutes trying to write this thing.  All right, what do you got?  Well, I got this. 
[02:28:30]  All right.  And you got this.  And we got to bridge this together.  All right, you come in here and just move a little bit.  All right, that'll work.  Socks.  A brand new day.  Oh, oh.  You stay ready to be called as spirit of our organization.  America.  America. 
[02:29:00]  America.  America.  This is the lighter moment.  Get your lighters out for that part. 
[02:29:30]  I'll hear you.  That is so bad.  And then I love how the end just has to keep going and going.  Because they didn't try, so they have to fill up about a minute.  So we'll do the chorus over and over and over again.  Not quite a we are the world.  This is the same Bono that sang Sunday Bloody Sunday.  My, how things have changed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can't imagine why people say he's sold out.  He hasn't changed at all. 
[02:30:00]  America.  The Trucker.  This is horse shit.  Worst song I've ever heard.  That's coming in from Mike in New Mexico.  I hate it, actually.  Clint in Texas.  Clint.  It sounds like a South Park montage or something.  Yes.  Something the South Park would have done.  It sounds just like something on South Park.  Yeah.  All right.  Later.  Later, man.  I'm going to save myself time and just go to Liberty Island right now, pound on the ground  and say, damn you.  Jesus.  Are you kidding? 
[02:30:30]  Why wait?  All right.  We got Tito Ortiz here.  And he only has to 10-15, as people are saying.  Oh, really?  We'll talk to him next.  Stay there.  Open Anthony.  Are you ready?  All right.  Look at him.  We got a full house.  This is what's going on.  We got Joe DeRosa stopped by to say hi.  Jimmy had to leave early to go to Miami for a comedy show that he's doing tomorrow.  So he'll be gone the next couple of days.  Joe came in to say hi.  Wow.  Tito dressing all nice now.  What's up with you?  Tito Ortiz entering the studio. 
[02:31:00]  We got Mars to help with some MMA stuff.  And we got Big John from Rock of Love Bus, right?  The Rock of Love Bus this time around?  Yeah.  It's good.  Good to see you guys again.  Tito looking sharp.  Thank you, man.  I just rang the bell at the NASTIC.  Did you really?  Yeah, it was awesome.  I was so stoked.  I mean, you know, as a kid coming from the streets to be able to be in that same situation,  and it's been a dream of me.  You know, I've had two huge dreams come true in the last eight months.  I bought my son the Guinness Book of World Records in 3D, and he was reading through it, 
[02:31:30]  and he's like, Dad, you're in this book.  Really?  What?  Most title defenses in mixed martial arts history.  Wow.  Yeah, I was like, that was pretty cool to be in the Guinness Book of World Records.  Thanks for ringing the bell.  It's down 41 points.  Yeah, what's going on?  No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, stop.  That's not showing until tomorrow.  So this morning, that had to do with me.  So tomorrow they're showing it.  What?  They don't do that shit live?  I thought they did it live.  Oh, that's not, wow, we're learning something.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  I would have said it was live if he didn't say it would go down 41 points. 
[02:32:00]  How much is that watch?  Extremely impressive watch.  Yeah, it's nice.  This is from Rockwell, one of my new sponsors.  I think this watch is about 15 Gs.  Thank God I didn't have to pay for it, huh?  It's huge, huh?  It's a huge square watch.  You shouldn't say that, though, on the air.  Somebody might try to kick your ass and take it.  I would love to see that one.  That would be a stout.  They didn't have a gun.  Somebody were in New York, they just might one.  I'm wearing a free pair of Fruit of the Looms. 
[02:32:30]  They gave me.  Yeah.  They're my new sponsors.  You shouldn't say that on the air.  People might try to give you a wedgie.  All right.  Hey, John, you want to take on Tito?  Never.  For the watch?  Are you kidding me?  No.  You're the only one that might have a slight chance.  I'm going to take on the psycho women.  I'm not going to take on him.  Yeah, what's worse, like fighting in the MMA?  They're, like, fighting those women that are on...  Those women are insane.  I think those women are worse, man.  I've been watching that show.  Me and Jenna sit back and just crack her going, is this for real?  Bunch of skanks.  They're a train wreck. 
[02:33:00]  Trust me.  I don't know if you guys have been paying attention, but, I mean, every day, what you  don't see behind the scenes...  Yeah.  I mean, obviously, what you're seeing is edited, and, you know, Brett will tell you the same  thing, but behind the scenes is...  I'm just...  At words...  I'm without words.  At how stupid and how psychotic these women can be.  So, are they filming that stuff?  Oh, we're done filming.  We're done filming.  No, the behind the scenes stuff.  Did they film that?  Well, yeah, well, we did...  And when they released that...  VH1, what they did, and 51 Minds this time, and I think it's going to start next week, 
[02:33:30]  what they did was they gave me my own camera.  And the girls didn't know it.  So, behind the scenes on VSpot and VH1.com, it's going to be through the eyes of Big John.  You know, it's like, I walked around with a camera and filmed and kind of did a behind  the scenes thing where you'll get what I see.  Right.  And I guarantee you, you're going to love it.  These girls are a mess.  Psycho bitches.  Yeah, no kidding.  It's great.  So, Tito, are you fighting anymore?  Or are you...  Yeah, well, I'm actually... 
[02:34:00]  I'm just going through rehab right now.  I just had surgery...  Oh, I was going to ask the drug.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Every time you're rehab, we'll try to get you.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Thank God I'm using drugs by after 22, so, you know, I'm, you know, 33 years old.  I just got a surgery done that I've been waiting about five years to get done.  What surgery?  I had bulging discs, L45 and 5-1, so they fused those, and it's been three months, and,  I mean, I just flew from California to here, and...  With no problems?  No problems, no pain.  I mean, before I had numbness going down my leg, and it's gone, subsided. 
[02:34:30]  A company called NuVasive out of San Diego, California.  Found me a doctor in Las Vegas.  His name's William Smith, who's an awesome doctor.  Dr. Smith?  Yes.  Oh, dear.  All right.  Well, I'm thankful, man, because, you know, people always say, you go through a good surgery,  you have no pain, and I've been off painkillers for about almost two months now.  Got any left?  Yeah, I got some bottles of them, let me tell you, man.  I'll see if those were after some of the fights, given to my opponent. 
[02:35:00]  But you're going to go back into this?  Yeah, I'll be back into it, and, you know, Affliction is starting our second show.  This one will be on January 24th, the Day of Reckoning.  Yeah.  A great heavyweight card with Andrey Oloski versus Fyodor Emilienko, probably one of the  most dangerous heavyweights out there right now.  He was in here yesterday with his translator, and wow.  Yeah, he's...  What a monster.  Yeah, he's, you know...  He's a monster.  That's insane.  As a Russian who, you know, has no facial expressions at all, he's as blank as possible.  We got a slight smile out of him every once in a while, and then he would go back into 
[02:35:30]  that Russian stare thing.  Yeah, yeah, he's an interesting person.  And we were hoping the translator was doing the right thing.  Right, he probably just was, like, saying the nice stuff to you guys.  You never know, right?  Well, what I want to do is I want to get, like, somebody that speaks Russian and really  find out what that interview was all about.  Yeah, right.  Because I'm not taking the translator's word for it.  Yeah, but, I mean, the opponent he's fighting, Andrey Oloski, man, he's been on a terror.  He's been on a 5-0 record.  I mean, he's former heavyweight UFC world champ, you know, and he's been on a terror. 
[02:36:00]  He's been taking guys out in the first, second, third round.  I know you've got to pump up the show, but Fyodor's going to kick his ass.  You think so?  Right, Mars?  Yes, sir.  Absolutely.  Mars is a big MMA guy.  I'll bet you five bucks.  Fine, I'll bet you that.  Watch.  I'll go watch.  Watch for watch.  Where's your watch?  Well, I'll put you in the spot.  I'm good for it.  I didn't get a word.  Come on.  It's having the mouse ears painted back on it.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, but the undercard on this is going to be awesome, awesome, man.  I mean, Babalusa Brawl will be fighting Therese Sochigou, another guy from Pride.  And then Matt Lind will be fighting Vitor Balfour, former Light Habit world champion,  Vitor Balfour.  Matt Lind is number two in the world.  So this is going to be a stacked card.  I mean, and one thing in affliction, these guys fight in a ring.  They don't fight in a cage.  So for the stand-up striker, it's more strength for those guys.  So you're going to see some knockouts for sure.  And I'll be commentating, so I'll be able to give my color commentating for all the average 
[02:37:00]  fans out there to see what move is from one move to another.  Sure.  Mars, you got a question for Tito?  Is that your new gig, Tito?  For right now, you know, I just went through back surgery, like I said, three months ago.  My doctor says I can start training about six months into it.  So that's three more months.  And I want to give myself two more months on top of that just to get in great shape.  So for right now.  No time soon.  Yeah.  Well, commentating, you know, for right now.  I want to get my feet wet.  That's cool, though.  That's a good move.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Keep my name out there, of course. 
[02:37:30]  And at the same time, you know, get to watch some great fights.  You seem to have gotten into MMA when it was still pretty...  Twelve years ago.  ...pretty crazy.  Do you think that hurt you more?  Because there weren't as many rules and...  No.  The more rules, actually, it helps the fighters.  No, I mean, do you think that hurt you physically more than it would have...  ...for fighters coming up now for you to have been in it when there was less rules?  And you could just sit there and pound someone's face in for as long as possible. 
[02:38:00]  I mean, the worst injuries I've ever sustained was a torn ACL on my knee.  And I got that replaced.  Six months later, I fought Ken Shamrock the first time, stopped him in three rounds.  And my back problem has been about five years now.  And finally got it fixed.  And I don't know.  I can't wait until I'm 100%.  Because some of these light heavyweights, I feel sorry for him.  That's what I'm wondering.  Trust me, Tito.  We can't either hurt.  It's going to be good to see you back.  Yeah, a lot of fans are waiting to see me back.  Absolutely.  You know, I'm young, man. 
[02:38:30]  I'm only 33 years old.  You know, I see a lot of the great guys right now, like Randy Couture, on the way out.  He's 45.  You know, Chuck Liddell's hitting 40.  And these guys are on their way out.  And I've been there in the beginning.  You know, me and Couture started a career at the same night.  And I still got a bright future, man.  What do you think of Chuck?  You know, he's a simple man.  He's about as simple as can be.  It's fine.  You know, Chuck Liddell, he's a company businessman.  He's the yes, yes, man.  He's never, you know, stood up for himself.  I can't say he can look himself in the mirror and respect himself by taking advantage of it. 
[02:39:00]  But at the same time...  That's what I keep saying about him.  You know, I'll...  I've never said that.  I never would.  Please, Chuck.  You know what?  Chuck's a good guy.  And he deserves all the respect in the world.  You know, he's paid the way from where he is right now.  And T-Bag didn't have just a little more...  I don't know.  I would say...  Brains?  I don't know.  Maybe he got punched a few times in some time.  I don't know.  Have you seen some of the interviews he's done?  Well...  I mean, you get lost in maybe four or five words.  He has.  Tito, here's the deal. 
[02:39:30]  Tito, you can say that.  The rest of us are going to work.  Tito, no.  No, Chuck's a good guy.  I like Chuck, man.  You know, fuck that Cloverfield monster, right?  Cloverfield monster.  That's right, man.  Tito, hold on, hold on.  Tito, here's the deal.  Chuck was on our show,  and it's only fair to play what he said about you.  Okay.  And they just handed me this,  and I really should have pre-listed,  because I'm praying we didn't agree with Chuck.  Oh, shit.  It is fun.  Can you imagine that you won tonight?  I'm praying that you did.  Oh, my goodness.  Just know what happened.  If you're any good at voice recognition, 
[02:40:00]  just remember this is how I sound.  Before you put it in there,  I guarantee you this is what it sounds like.  Yeah, well, he's a pussy.  Yeah, oh, my God.  You know, um.  Yeah.  Do we play this?  I don't care what Chuck is saying.  I just don't want anybody agreeing with Chuck.  This is CD Russian roulette right here.  Really?  This is not.  Maybe we should agree with this.  Maybe we should agree with this.  Maybe we should agree with this.  Maybe we should agree with this.  When he was younger.  All right, let's see what Chuck said about you on our show.  Jimmy Norden isn't here,  so it's always,  he's the one with the loud mouth. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, definitely.  I guarantee you're going to call me a pussy.  Guaranteed.  Do you really dislike Tito Ortiz?  All right, that's Jim Norden,  so you could kill him.  Okay.  Well, he's just...  Um, I,  I'm not a big fan of his, no.  It really comes across.  Oh, really?  Chapter,  it never pays to mouth off,  and I immediately knew  who this one was going to be about.  The opening line,  and this is where  Chuck kind of veils the fact  that he's not crazy about Tito,  but I read through it.  I'm not sure why Tito is afraid to fight me,  but wouldn't hesitate to fight Randy.  Maybe he felt he had to fight, 
[02:41:00]  or else he'd be even more of a joke as champ  than he already was.  Wow.  Oh.  Having five title defenses,  that's pretty much of a joke.  But you know,  I mean,  that's a company,  a company against a person  who's trying to spread his wings,  as I've been doing,  and I'm continuing to do,  smashing you.  When you got a billion-dollar company  above you,  and they're trying to hold you down,  they're going to do everything  in their power,  in promotion,  in, you know,  I believe there was  the Spike television show 
[02:41:30]  where Dana White and me  were supposed to box.  That was never going to happen  because there was never no contract,  and they were trying  to take advantage of me.  I'm a smart businessman, man.  I'm not getting taken advantage of,  and they try to,  so what's the next best step to do?  Let's keep Tito out of the limelight.  Well, sorry, buddies.  I've been a star before.  Dana White,  you own the UFC,  and I'm going to continue  to do what I've been doing.  Let's dominate.  All right,  there's one more clip.  Please, please, please.  You're not cutting the editing  to get stuff out.  I have no idea.  We should listen to these  ahead of time. 
[02:42:00]  What is it about him  that just,  eh?  Well, you know,  he just,  he's only,  he makes a living off  running his mouth,  and then he's,  when you're throwing your mouth  and you're fighting anybody  they'll throw at you,  fine.  If you're running your mouth  and picking and choosing fights,  I don't like it.  Star and Stanley.  I don't care.  How do I care about  a guy that runs his mouth?  If you're willing to fight  anybody they put in front of you,  go ahead,  run your mouth.  If you back it up,  go right ahead.  That's kind of funny.  That's,  you know,  it's being a pussy.  There we go. 
[02:42:30]  Keyword.  A pussy.  Now,  I've fought in every single person  they've ever put in front of me.  And it's just really funny  because I remember me and Chuck  that I used to train with each other.  I said,  if we ever fight each other,  we're going to get paid millions  to do it.  Well,  why not?  Well,  he kind of sold out.  And,  you know,  I think we,  I think we both made maybe  a hundred grand at the most  for the fight.  And it's just one of those  situations of why,  why,  why would you do that?  You're making the company  all the money.  And yes,  it's great.  I mean,  we've been,  it'd be different when we fought  for one or two years. 
[02:43:00]  We've been fighting for 11 years,  12 years.  I mean,  we should be getting a bigger chunk.  I mean,  and fighters shouldn't think like that.  All they should think about  is just fight,  fight,  fight.  Well,  hey,  listen,  buddy,  I got a family.  I got bills to pay.  And at the end of the day,  I got to look in the mirror  and respect myself  and pay those bills  and feed my kids mouths.  And that's what it's all about.  And if I don't speak out,  no one will.  Your calmness scares the shit out of you.  Come on.  You know,  but seriously,  you're just like,  oh,  really? 
[02:43:30]  Yeah,  but you can't understand.  The average guy,  if he's called a pussy,  let me tell you something.  You know what?  I'm not an aggressive person.  And the calmness is,  I'm not scared  than a guy in a suit  that knows how to fight.  There's just something scary  about the suit.  You can talk well  at the same time,  right?  I mean,  I think,  Chuck,  the stuttering Stanley Liddell.  You would think  with all that money,  you'd actually probably  maybe get some speech classes  or something?  I don't know.  I'm just saying,  just because he called me a pussy,  that's the only reason  I'm saying the thing.  But Chuck Liddell 
[02:44:00]  was a great champion.  He probably will never be again,  but he was a great champion.  Honest answers.  Well,  this is leading somewhere.  Ladies and gentlemen,  Chuck Liddell.  Awesome.  God,  his belly  even got bigger.  Oh,  my God.  Guess what he was  for Halloween.  You guys would never even guess.  What?  He was Santa Claus. 
[02:44:30]  You know,  you guys get to leave  and we have to deal with this  the next time he's in.  You're the guys  who are like  trying to push it on you.  You want some good stuff.  Good point.  I can keep going,  but I'll be nice.  I'll be really nice.  Chuck,  you know,  Chuck's a good guy,  man.  I got to give him  the respect and value  if he's worked hard  to get where he is right now.  A little punch drunk,  but yeah,  he's worked hard  to get where he is right now.  What do you think  of Brock Lesnar?  He's an awesome athlete.  A lot of people say  he's an awesome athlete,  but I think  he's young.  Yeah,  I think a lot of the guys 
[02:45:00]  that have been around  a long time  are like,  oh,  come on.  He's a champion already?  When I first fought,  back in 97,  I only trained  for six months  before I competed  and I fought four times.  I was 4-0  and I fought for the world title  in my fourth fight  and I fought Frank Shamrock  and lost to him,  but I had that situation  and the same thing.  I was a young kid  who had a great wrestling background  and I just had the intensity  to keep training.  Within seven months later,  I became the light heavy  world champion. 
[02:45:30]  Brock Lesnar  has that same situation.  He's agile as hell.  For a guy who's six,  285 pounds,  he's a monster, man.  I mean,  you can't take the guy down  and he's starting  to learn how to punch.  He's getting pretty vicious.  But he's no  Fyodor Milenko  without a doubt  or he's no  Andrei Oloski  without a doubt  and when he fights  guys at that level,  I really think  that he'd get crushed  but at the same time,  he works hard.  So you think  they're protecting him  a little bit?  A little bit, yes.  I mean, 
[02:46:00]  he's going to do a rematch  with what?  Frank Mir, right?  Frank Mir.  What do you think  of that?  I think Frank Mir  has a great chance  of submitting him  but at the same time,  you know,  Brock's been doing  his jiu-jitsu.  He's a wrestler.  You think Brock  has learned his lesson?  Possibly, you know.  Us wrestlers, man,  we learn no matter what  just because we learn  of hard work  and dedication  and sacrifices  to be the best  and I know  he's putting his time  in, hopefully.  You know,  hopefully the title  didn't get to his head  and all the stardism  and all that baloney  but, you know,  I wish luck to him.  I like Brock.  I really do like him.  I think he's a good guy.  Cool. 
[02:46:30]  Mars, you've got a lot  of good questions so far.  Keep it up.  Jesus.  You're sitting  in front of a microphone.  Why don't you use it?  I could do basic questions  with this stuff.  Go a little deeper for us.  Deeper?  Oh, congratulations  on the twins?  Yes.  Not yet.  We're actually probably  in the middle of April  is looking at it.  First question,  you fucked it up.  No, no,  I'm not saying  that the twins were born.  Well, you should say  congratulations  after they're born. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, after they're born.  Okay.  Everyone's still  holding their breath.  Yeah, we're all  holding our breath  and hoping that everything  works out okay  and it's healthy.  The big man upstairs  will take care of it  and make it happen.  Mars, congratulations  on your firing.  Wait, wait, wait.  You're starting to sound  like Chuck Liddell right now.  I don't know.  I was congratulating  on my conceptions,  you know.  When, you know.  You concede?  No, you know.  When my wife got pregnant,  I was congratulating.  What?  Congratulations. 
[02:47:30]  As a matter of fact,  you congratulated me.  By the guy that did it.  I'm going to come over  and punch me in the face.  No.  So, how do you feel  with your back surgery?  I mean, have you been  training in the cage?  I haven't been training yet.  Actually, I've just been  going therapy three times  a week at Pro Sport  in Costa Mesa, California.  Guy Joe Donahue  has been taking care  of me very well.  My core has been  getting really,  really strong.  But pre-surgery,  actually, I worked  with a guy,  Paul Lacanino, 
[02:48:00]  one of my strength coaches.  And he made my  solus muscle,  which is the muscle  that protects your spine  and everything,  so thick.  When the doctor went in,  it took an hour  and a half extra  to get to the solus muscle.  He was like,  that's like three times  the size of I've ever  seen anybody's  solus muscle.  Wow.  So, I did all the  hard work before.  He goes,  if your solus muscle  wasn't that big,  I guarantee you  won't be able to fight.  I've been going through  pain for the last five years.  I mean, I fought Liddell twice.  I fought Couture.  I fought Belfort.  I fought Forrest Griffin.  I fought the champ  right now, Rashad Evans. 
[02:48:30]  I got a draw with him.  I beat Forrest Griffin,  so I'm still at the top  of the hill, you know.  I did just lose a match  to Machido,  who ran for me  the whole time,  and he won by points.  I mean,  this is mixed martial arts.  This ain't boxing,  you know.  But I'm still here, man.  I'm still building up  to get back to 100%,  and my back's doing good.  Like I said,  I took the flight  from California  to here,  and five hours  wasn't a problem.  You know,  no soreness, nothing.  Getting back to Machido,  how did he get out  that triangle?  He did a crocodile roll. 
[02:49:00]  Actually,  it was kind of like  the last desperation.  Of course he got  to do a crocodile roll.  Yeah.  That's how you get  out of the triangle.  Of course,  everyone knows.  He got lucky, man,  because there was,  I watched a fight  one time,  and just one of those  like,  oh,  so close.  You had him for a while.  Yeah,  I had it for a second,  and I think I popped  his arm a little bit,  and he was like,  I was going to go out.  He was either going  to break my arm  or choke me out.  I was not going  to tap.  But,  you know,  Machido's a runaway  fighter.  You know,  he picks his points  and runs,  picks his points  and runs.  He's not a guy 
[02:49:30]  to get,  you know,  throwing blows  and exchange  with a person,  which is fine.  You know,  he's not really  that exciting  to watch.  People like  to watch my fights.  I think that's  why I do so good  at pay-per-view.  John,  you got a question  for Tito?  Do I have a question  for him?  Do I have a question  for you,  John?  I'm excited  to say that.  Do I have a question  for you,  John?  All right,  Tito's got one  for you.  All right.  So what is some  of the craziest  stuff you see  some of these  girls doing?  Well,  I can tell you  this much.  Those of you  that have seen  this third season, 
[02:50:00]  I've never seen  a shot not only  put in the bajay-jay,  but poured in.  Poured in.  I mean,  Brett and I  have been together  for 14 years,  okay?  And it wasn't  just a test tube shot.  It was,  they spread her  shit open  and poured it in  and then drank it out.  I'm like,  who drank it out?  Yeah,  it was Gia and  Taya.  It wasn't Taya.  It wasn't Taya.  Oh,  I thought Taya  was part of that. 
[02:50:30]  Taya,  well,  we were all  in the same bar,  but I mean,  we were just  disgusted.  I mean,  they poured  the shit in.  Were you really  disgusted,  John?  Dude,  it was gross.  You were disgusted?  Was she like  a fountain spitting  it out?  No,  if you would have  seen it.  Maybe it was  in the bottle.  There's a lot  of things  that I've seen.  Exactly.  And being on the road,  you've seen a lot  of things.  Exactly.  It wasn't in the  butthole,  was it?  No,  no,  no.  What they did  was they actually  spread her open  and poured it in  and then stuck  the test tube in  and drank it out.  And I'm like,  and you were  disgusted by that? 
[02:51:00]  You don't like it.  You've seen worse  things than that.  Oh,  I've seen worse  than that,  but if you would have  seen her coos.  Not a fan of the  vagina?  Not a fan of her.  It wasn't  like a roast beef sandwich.  Depends on the  drink, too.  I'd get the same  thing down at the  carney deli.  It's an Alabama  slammer.  It might be a little  He poured it  with a  I guess I'm not  going to watch it.  You're not looking  like bourbon.  You don't want  a Bloody Mary  to do with that.  Sex on the beach,  anything creamy 
[02:51:30]  might be a little  rough, too, right?  But that's a  one of them.  I think it was  a buttery nipple  or something.  I don't remember.  Buttery snatch.  Nice yeasty shot.  I will tell you that.  Hey, you got  something going on  with Taya  because she was  in here recently.  Taya's a sweetheart.  I love her to death.  She's obviously  penthouse pet of the year.  We got her naked  and she did everything  we asked of her.  She got on my stripper pole?  You got lucky.  I see you still  got the stripper pole.  Apparently.  You broke it.  I know, I broke it  last time.  It's for six  tall girls. 
[02:52:00]  No, Taya is  absolutely awesome.  There's a few girls  from this season  that I keep in touch with.  Taya.  Did you bang any of them?  From season two, maybe.  Ah, he just smiled.  He did that smile.  He just had a smirk.  I got benefits.  Don't they have to  go through you  to get to Brett,  you know, that old story?  Hey, Brett,  this is so important.  Don't kiss her.  You've been a road guy  for a long, long time.  Yeah, absolutely.  So is that shit true  where all of a sudden  a girl goes,  I'll blow you  to get backstage?  100%.  Absolutely, 100% true.  It really happens, huh? 
[02:52:30]  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  That was a lot.  Of course they do.  Yeah, right?  They want to go  meet the band.  Trust me,  it doesn't take long.  They're with the band  before you know it,  you know,  especially with me.  It's the greatest blowjob  they've ever given.  I'm not afraid to say it.  At least I'm getting some.  Yeah.  Fucking amazing.  Why did I go into comedy?  I'm going into music.  It's like nobody's lining up  to blow me.  Caroline's.  Caroline's.  No, but your helpers, 
[02:53:00]  they are.  You know,  they're getting it.  Helpers?  I don't have any fucking helpers.  You don't?  Are you kidding me?  Oh, God.  You've got to have a tour manager.  He has two helpers,  his right and left hand.  He started fucking crying  when he was like,  we were supposed to make  a lot of money on that fight.  We made like 100 grand.  I was like,  I would let you punch me  in the face for $20.  Yeah, but you've got to understand,  this is like eight years of training.  This is eight years of training,  six days a week,  eight hours a day of,  you know,  we put on a mouthpiece, 
[02:53:30]  a cup,  shorts,  gloves,  and shin pads.  And we kick and punch each other  in training  every single day.  Believe me,  the training that we go through,  making the money on the fight  is not what it's all about.  It's the training we put into it  is the money we should be making.  Because when you're training  six to eight hours a day,  six days a week,  and going through,  you know,  wake up and run four miles  in the morning,  go lift weights,  go spar,  go hit pads,  go wrestle,  go jiu-jitsu.  I mean,  this is a six to eight hour day,  six days a week 
[02:54:00]  for eight years.  Holy shit.  Think of it that way.  I mean,  maybe you take a month off  during a year,  you know,  maybe only how many hours a day  does that come out there?  Six to eight.  Six to eight in a gym.  Yes.  Or whatever.  Six days a week.  Jesus.  We're not getting paid  for the fight.  To us,  this is like  going to watch your car  on a Saturday  and going to drive it  on a Sunday.  That's the easiest part.  It's all beautiful.  The fights are easy.  And what was your day off like?  Day off is  get to go eat pizza,  go watch that,  yeah.  No,  get to go eat pizza, 
[02:54:30]  have ice cream,  watch a movie,  get to relax.  For real?  Just go nuts  on your day off?  As much as we possibly can.  It's just a factor  of just making sure  you get your head  out of the gym  for a day.  So much discipline  that takes to fucking do that.  See,  now you guys understand  the money that's being made,  but what about the company  that's making the money?  Think of it that way.  They're making  $40 to $50 million on you  and you're only making  $100 grand.  Do you have a problem with that?  And you're the one  putting your ass on,  putting people's seat  in the ass.  Are you talking about  the last contract  we just signed?  It certainly sounds like it.  And you're asking 
[02:55:00]  about my back.  UFC denied the claim.  You had my back surgery.  Denied the claim.  After 11 years ago,  because Dana White  don't like me.  They had no problem  paying for,  who was it?  One of the other fighters,  two of the other fighters  back surgery.  They had no problem  paying for it.  Nate Quarry?  Nate Quarry.  Had no problem  paying for his.  But when I asked for it,  they said,  no,  deny claim.  Keep.  And I was shit out of luck.  Thank God I had my own  insurance that took care of it.  And that was the final straw for me. 
[02:55:30]  You know,  people wanted to go back  and fight for the UFC.  And it's just,  they make it too personal to me,  man.  You know,  Lorenzo Fertitta,  Frank Fertitta are awesome guys  who own the station casinos.  But,  you know,  Dana White and me,  we've had our battle forwards.  And I'm washing my hands.  I'm going on.  Just because of the thing  that sealed the sign  and delivered everything  was not taking care of my surgery.  I mean,  this is something.  I mean,  fighting's fun and everything.  But at the end of the day,  when I have my son  and I want to play the football with him,  I want to be able to do that.  And it's obvious  where that came from.  It's not like  it wasn't business related. 
[02:56:00]  You know?  Yeah.  And then they try to cover themselves up  and have the insurance company  send a letter to me  saying why they,  that they couldn't pinpoint  when the surgery,  I mean,  when the injury happened.  Bullshit.  I was like,  yeah,  but it's kind of funny  that Dana White's like,  here,  we'll inject you  so you won't feel it.  Here,  take these pills.  You won't feel it.  People don't,  all the true fans  don't get to see  that stuff that happens  behind the scenes.  You can't pinpoint the time.  Was it when you were  folded in half?  I think there might have been.  But hey,  you know,  it's just one of those  slaps in the face, man. 
[02:56:30]  It's just like,  you know,  you give your company  11 years of your life  and you make them  millions upon millions  upon millions  upon millions  and yeah,  at the end of the day,  I am Tito Ortiz  and they can say,  we made you.  Well,  what happened to Matt Hughes?  He was the world champ.  People don't know who he is.  I mean,  they know Liddell,  they know Couture,  they know Tito Ortiz.  I mean,  the other guys  are still catching up to us.  You think Affliction has a shot?  I think so,  100%.  They did a smart move.  They did a very,  very smart move,  bringing Golden Boy  promotions, 
[02:57:00]  have some of the biggest  boxing events in the world  and bringing Donald Trump along  helped a little bit also.  Right.  And now they have M1 Global  who actually,  when companies  started correlating  with each other  and working with each other  and making champions  fight other champions,  that's what fans want to see.  They want to see  the best of the best.  Right.  Now,  UFC,  they have a monopoly.  They do what they want.  They make the champions they want.  Absolutely.  I'm surprised  Vince McMahon  hasn't gotten into this.  He's a hell of a promoter.  I think the problem with him  is he can't make the fights happen.  You know,  he can't make guys win. 
[02:57:30]  In mixed martial arts,  you never know  who's going to win.  Yeah,  I understand that part.  It could be a credibility issue.  Yeah.  Credibility issue also.  That's another one too.  That's the thing about MMA  that's always fascinated me  is the fact that  you could have  a fighter go in there  that's like,  oh my God,  this guy's going to  beat the shit out of this guy.  And then all of a sudden,  yeah,  something happens.  Someone makes one wrong move.  One wrong move.  And bam,  they're tapping on you.  What the fuck just happened?  You realize,  oh,  the guy's fucking arm  is shoved up his ass  sideways. 
[02:58:00]  I didn't catch that  until I looked at the replay,  you know?  Yeah,  right.  And taps out  through his own colon.  As Mars thinks  of his next question,  I got another one.  No,  actually,  yeah.  That's wonderful,  Mars.  It's so worth  giving you  your own headphones  and microphone.  Tito,  Rampage Jackson,  what do you think  of his knockout?  Him being knocked out.  Who?  Not Rampage.  What the hell  am I talking about?  Oh my God.  Oh yeah,  that big motherfucker.  Kimbo,  I'm sorry.  Why did I say Rampage?  What do you think of... 
[02:58:30]  Kimbo,  that was just a time  of it happening  one time or another.  It seems like  all you guys knew  that was going to happen to him.  The first guys he fought  were guys who were fed  and they started doing  the boxing image  of give guys  who he could crush  and beat.  Well,  Seth Petruzzelli  is not a guy  you could just crush  and beat.  I mean,  he has a great record  at 16 and 4,  I believe it,  at 16 and 5.  And he's good  at stand-up.  He likes the color pink,  too.  He's a crush.  That can't help  Kimbo Slice  when he goes back  to his neighborhood.  Like, 
[02:59:00]  yo,  this guy got knocked out  by someone with pink hands.  That's got to be  a little rough.  Yeah.  When you go hang out  with your boys  and go with him.  Yeah,  just like one of those  welcome to reality,  you know?  When you crack on the chin  it shows you're not  inhuman.  Absolutely.  That was inevitable.  You know that.  I mean,  eventually it was going  to happen.  Dude,  when that went down,  man,  I was actually at a party.  The room went effing nuts.  But then you also knew  the league was done  because they were  counting on Kimbo  to carry that.  I was so bummed.  That was an opportunity.  But hey,  blessing in disguise.  Everything happens  for a reason.  Because then no one else. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah,  it was all about Kimbo.  And they were getting  great ratings and all that.  Mars,  what do you got for Tito?  I know you guys are boys.  Me and Quentin,  we're boys.  There's so many other  fights to do,  though, man.  I mean,  there's so many other  guys to beat.  Me and Quentin,  man,  we're just really close,  man.  We started a career  together,  you know?  We've trained with each  other for like seven  and a half years.  But,  you know,  the almighty doll  always speaks loudest  and the fans always  want to see the best  fights possible.  And I would like to do  that.  That'd be awesome.  I would like to see 
[03:00:00]  Fidor cut down to 205  and Tito Ortiz  and Fidor.  That'd be an awesome  fight there.  Wow.  No fear?  Jesus.  No fear there?  Nah.  I don't have no fear.  I'm not a fear.  No, man.  You guys are monsters.  Yeah, you guys.  You understand what you do?  Monsters.  Suddenly,  I don't feel so big.  Exactly.  And I'm like,  holy shit.  What you do in this  radio station every day...  I'm scared of Big John  and he's an alcoholic.  Don't look at me.  I think I was like,  I'm going to turn  into an alcoholic.  What you do in this  radio station every single  day is what I do 
[03:00:30]  in the gym every single  day.  Work hard, right?  That's why you're so good  at what you do.  Yeah, of course.  That's why I'm so good  at what I do, man.  That's the case  we haven't done a sit-up  in four years.  How many times  have you put those  earphones on?  What do you mean?  Put them on your head.  How many times  have you put them  on your head?  Oh, like when I'm  home, I'm working out?  No, whatever you do.  When you come into work.  Yeah, sure.  A lot of times.  I have passion for what I do.  Is that what you're doing?  I put my gloves on.  I put my gloves,  my mouthpiece,  my shin pads,  and headgear  and we kick and punch  each other.  No fear.  You guys are going  to a press conference, 
[03:01:00]  but it's got to be said,  Tito is really,  really, really good  to his fans  and I want to get  Matthew on the phone  with you.  Matthew in North Carolina.  Everybody wants  to talk to you  but I don't know.  We have time for one  at least.  Matthew.  Hey, what's going on?  Open Anthony.  Hey, what's up?  Not too much.  Hey, Tito,  I miss you a lot in UFC.  I'm really sorry.  You got a rod deal  from Dana White  and everything.  Your last fight  was bullshit.  You should have  beaten Leona.  Well, man,  I hope to get  to see you fight  again, sir.  Yes, 100%, man.  This year I will be  fighting for sure  and I'll be 100%. 
[03:01:30]  By the end of the year  you think you'll be  back in there?  Yeah, before the end  of the year.  I think about summertime  I'm thinking about it.  I just want to make  sure I'm 100%.  Are you going to  start slow?  Maybe, I don't know.  Maybe an easy fight  someone like...  Let's fight a girl  or something.  Fight one of the Rock  of I'm not a bust girl.  I'll tell you what,  Tito, I'll put you up  against every one  of those girls.  Ah, no way.  We should just have  them all run at them  at the same time.  I would watch  that pay-per-view.  You don't have to fight  or just do a shot  out of her pussy.  I'm a happy man, man. 
[03:02:00]  I think that would  have a problem  if you decided  to try the hottest  chick in the world.  I'm stoked.  I'm a proud man.  Alright, can I do  the shot out of her  pussy then?  Have at it.  I'll tell you what,  if you saw it,  you wouldn't be doing it.  The pussy was that bad,  Big John?  It was not only look,  but smell and everything.  I mean, it was nasty.  It was a Carnegie  dick was gross.  Beef sandwich. 
[03:02:30]  I'm telling you,  I'm going to the  Carnegie Deli  and I'll match it.  Trust me.  Alright.  Tito, what's going on today?  We didn't get the,  I know we got the big  pay-per-view on Saturday.  Press conference today  at 11.  I'm not sure of the...  Is that Trump Tower, right?  Trump Tower, yes.  In the atrium,  I do believe.  Exactly.  And it's over to the public.  So you can go  and the public come down.  You guys want to  take pictures with me  and I know,  actually,  Theodore will be there also.  The rest of you guys  will be there.  It'll be good.  Don't shake  when you see Theodore.  Is it Theodore or Theodore? 
[03:03:00]  Theodore, Theodore, Theodore.  I just want to make sure  I say it right  next time he's in here.  And actually,  on the 31st  in Las Vegas  at the Hooters,  I'm opening an MMA store,  Punishment MMA store  in Las Vegas  on the 31st.  I'm actually,  you know,  I got to kind of get  my business senses together  and start working out  doing that,  doing MMA stores.  Fans want to buy gear  and this is one  of the first stores  I'm opening.  We've been with Tito  a long time.  It's really weird to see  in the very expensive suit,  my friend.  We're used to you  coming in  and you're fighting gear 
[03:03:30]  and beating up Steve  and whoever else  we threw at you.  Yeah, right?  That was fun.  That was fun.  That was a long time.  God, that was...  That video's still  really funny to watch  online.  Steve,  God bless Steve.  Steve said,  yeah,  I'll take him on.  See how long it takes  him to, you know,  take me out.  And how many seconds?  11 seconds?  That was 10 years ago.  I don't think  he was short  in like 11 seconds.  He didn't even  last that long.  I don't even think  he lasted 11.  How many seconds?  What?  11.  11 seconds.  See, I don't even  forget it  because I remember  you were like,  this guy. 
[03:04:00]  I said 30 seconds.  They're like,  yeah, right,  sure, sure.  I go,  okay, come on.  We cleared  everything out  and before I know  he got his back choked.  I had no idea  who you were back then.  This was like  two days before  my world title defense.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  My opponent's like  sitting watching this  happening.  He goes,  dude,  are you sure  you should do this?  I'm like,  don't worry about it.  It'll be easy.  He's like,  who'd you end up  fighting two days later?  That was,  was it Elvis Sinisek?  Yeah,  and I stopped him  and like,  I think a little faster.  No,  I stopped him.  Was he a little  tougher for you?  Yeah,  he was actually. 
[03:04:30]  No,  he's heavy.  I mean,  at that time,  you're about what,  255?  Oh,  355.  You're being nice.  360 at that time?  Yeah.  You got double-legged  and you got choked.  Oh,  here it is.  Here it is.  This is Tito  from 10 years ago  taking out Steve.  Fucking Steve.  What the fuck?  He is wrapped around  Steve like crazy,  choking him out.  And that was it.  Over.  That was a good over.  And he was big too  and he was like,  yeah,  I wrestled in college.  He was like,  oh shit.  Yeah.  I thank God  my timing was really good  at the time.  Well,  Big John was saying,  you're fighting a bear. 
[03:05:00]  Big John was just saying  a little while ago  that you wouldn't mind  seeing how long  you could last with Tito.  So,  are you ready?  No.  Not even close.  I got to throw  in the towel  of not 100%.  I'm about 50% right now.  When he gets 100%,  maybe we'll try it.  Yeah,  we'll get 100% for sure.  I'm kidding,  Tito.  We're going to take a break.  Tito has to leave.  It's a pleasure,  my friend.  Continued success.  We got the pay-per-view  Saturday.  Yes,  Saturday the 24th.  I'm watching.  Yes.  I'm starting to watch 
[03:05:30]  more and more.  I'm really starting  to get into this.  Absolutely.  In Anaheim,  I get rid of the fifth expo.  I'm doing a signing there  on Saturday morning  and Sunday morning.  Okay,  cool.  Yeah,  so all my fans  will come down.  If you can't make it  to the fight,  buy it on pay-per-view.  All right.  It'll be some Tito there,  man.  Thank you.  Big John,  you staying or going?  Hang on for a few.  Hang.  You guys got to ask  some better questions  about some of the chicks  though.  Hang on.  Oh,  it'll get rank,  I'm sure.  I've been on tour  with Korn a few times 
[03:06:00]  and it was crazy sometimes  so I can only imagine.  Korn,  I love Korn.  We go way back  with Korn.  Yeah,  me too.  They used to play  little shows  for our station  up in Boston  and now look  what happened to them.  Love those guys.  All the guys  were really awesome.  I grew up with them  in Huntington.  Did you really?  From Bakersfield  to Huntington.  Fieldy,  Reggie,  he's actually  a really good  friend of mine.  John,  Brian,  all those guys.  Brian left,  but all the rest  of the guys.  How's Brian doing?  Wow.  Yeah,  well,  it's just a situation.  You have everything  in the world  at your hands.  He's the guy  that went 
[03:06:30]  and turned  born again  and all that.  You don't know  how to control it  when it comes  to the drugs  and partying  and all this stuff.  He's a rock star,  man.  So he had to get clean,  which,  you know,  more power to him.  He's settled.  He's doing the great things  that, you know.  What does he tell  rock stars  in that position?  Because everybody else,  they go,  what are you doing?  Come on,  you're living like a rock star  with your drugs and this.  It's like a rock star.  It's like,  yeah,  I'm a rock star.  That's why I'm doing the drugs  and fucking everybody.  I don't think it'll last so long.  That's so important.  You do whatever the fuck you want.  Yeah,  I fucking want a rock star. 
[03:07:00]  Let's thank Tito  for coming by.  Yeah,  thank you,  everybody.  Of course,  you can go on the World Wide Web  at Punishment.com.  Check out my gear  and TitoOrtiz.com.  Mars,  terrific job.  Yeah,  you did a great job.  Make sure next time  we have a few written down.  I think we got a couple  little scraps  on a piece of paper  in front of him  that says back,  gig,  twins.  It's so worth  all the emails  that went around  all night long.  I know this is radio,  but what's up  with the cufflings?  Are those clowns?  Oh,  you call them a clown?  Skulls.  What are they?  Skulls. 
[03:07:30]  Skulls.  You mistook  a skull for clowns?  Diamonds,  huh?  Yeah.  Didn't look like  he was going to break  his nose.  Got to look smooth.  He would have just  popped Mars in the face  when he looked at him.  Yeah,  look at the cufflink.  No,  look closer.  Wham!  Now go look in the mirror  and you figure out  if it's a clown or a skull.  It's imprinted  on your forehead,  dummy.  The sad part is  he can kick my effing ass  this guy in seconds.  Oh,  yeah.  All right,  we got to take a break.  Thanks,  Tito.  All right,  guys,  thank you much.  Outside.  All right,  we're back. 
[03:08:00]  We're watching  the inauguration live.  Oh,  God,  we just,  and they just,  wow,  we're in a conversation.  No kidding.  And they just  pretty much wheeled  Ted Kennedy out.  This is the last one  of these he's going to see.  Oh,  yeah.  And he's got a big,  nice black hat on.  He's got like  an Indiana Jones fedora.  And Ant and I  were discussing,  you got to imagine  that's covering up  a world of hurt.  And then you said,  what,  he must have  like the whole 
[03:08:30]  top half of his head.  Yeah,  like Hannibal Lecter  like it did  in the second movie.  What's his name?  That was,  the guy that played  in Goodfellas.  Yeah,  of course.  I always forget  his fucking name.  Ray Liotta.  Ray Liotta,  thank you.  One of the dumbest  scenes in movie history  as far as legit movies go.  Wasn't he feeding him  his own brainer  cooking and a little bit?  He walks down  into the kitchen  or whatever  with half his head,  top of the head  and it's like,  we're supposed  to believe this?  And then he was behind him  cutting pieces 
[03:09:00]  of his brain out  in front of him  and then putting him  in the thing.  I was enjoying his story.  I know.  You've got to say that.  You've got to figure out that.  During the break,  I asked again,  you had said  the stench  of the woman's crotch.  Not a woman,  she was a skank.  I asked what it smelled like.  We got into this term about,  and then Opie said,  you know,  you've got to be careful  before you just go down  on a chick.  And then I was saying  I had a girl over  at my house  and she blew me.  And then she said,  are you going to go down on me?  And I said, 
[03:09:30]  no.  And she said,  why not?  And I said,  because I just met you.  I don't know you.  She sucks as dead.  I don't know you.  Yeah,  she goes,  but I blew you.  And I go,  that's different.  It's just a completely  different argument.  Like you said,  everything's on the outside.  They're going to inspect it.  It's like getting food  and you're eating it  and you look  and then you put it in your mouth  or then someone going,  shut your eyes  and open your mouth.  When are you more nervous?  You're a lot more nervous.  We're at least now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not doing that shit. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah,  you can see anything wrong.  Yes.  Anything wrong.  You know what?  It doesn't matter.  Beauty is a light switch away,  but that smell was just,  you know what I mean?  I've been with...  If you weren't so bad,  I'd go over there  and slap you for that line.  I have been with fat, ugly.  I don't give a...  I don't care,  but that was just gross.  That's brutal  when it smells like  you just stepped into Dagobah.  Dagobah.  Jesus.  Big John said  it smelled like an armpit, right?  Yeah,  it's like Tito's armpit 
[03:10:30]  after a match.  You said that  while he was here, Big John.  Is he still here?  He showed you  didn't have to turn sideways  and it was her armpit.  Fuck, man.  It's the back of her knee.  It's great.  Oh, that's classic.  Classic.  Unpid ain't bad,  but your pussy stinks.  Maybe...  She knew it.  Maybe it stunk  because, I mean,  you make those girls do shit.  Don't they have to, like,  run obstacle courses and shit  and try to fuck right there?  You'll see. 
[03:11:00]  What Brett did  was we do the  Truck Stock Olympics  where they got to  take a hot dog  and run through the course  and slip and...  Remember the slip and slides?  I mean,  jumping over the bus drivers,  everything.  jump into a...  I swear to God,  the pool was as big  as this room  full of beer.  Yeah, I mean,  we got them.  It's great.  We got them much this year.  Not too much yeast in those things  that take hold.  Exactly.  I don't understand  why it stunk.  We had her soaking in beer  up there.  I have no idea.  Running around the parking lot. 
[03:11:30]  Look at Dick Cheney  looking like...  Oh, Jesus.  Dr. Evil or something.  Right, right.  Dick Cheney's in a wheelchair  for the inauguration.  They're saying  because he heard  his back moving.  Yeah.  They're not telling us  the truth there,  that's for sure.  That's the first time  we've seen him  in how long  and he's in a wheelchair.  That's why.  He heard his back  fighting in USC.  Yeah, he was doing  some ultimate fighting  or something.  He looks like Mr. Burns  in a wheelchair there. 
[03:12:00]  For my next trick, kids.  Yeah.  I like...  They did...  They had Kennedy...  Kennedy looked like  at the end of Citizen Kane  the way that...  Oh, shit.  You know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.  When just all the power  is just complete...  He's just in complete delusion  by that point in the film.  Now, they're opening the door  for Dick Cheney.  Is he going to be able  to get out of the chair?  That's what I want to say.  Dick Cheney's in a wheelchair.  Can he get out?  Is it his back?  Let's see.  Let's see.  What is this?  All right.  Oh, boy.  The camera has to move  a little to the right  so he can't see him  get out of the wheelchair. 
[03:12:30]  And then they were like,  Are you fucking kidding me?  Some guy put a gun  into the cameraman's head.  Is what happened.  You think that's what happened?  Some fucking guy  just scoped out the cameraman.  There he was.  He stood up.  He just got in.  He sort of like  pulled himself up a little bit.  I mean, how much  do you have to, you know,  lift yourself up  to get in a car?  This is going to sound  like a crazy conspiracy theory.  I wouldn't be surprised  if that camera angle  wasn't to hide  how fucked up he is  but was to hide  that he's not hurt at all.  Do you know what I'm saying?  Oh, really?  The other way around you're going? 
[03:13:00]  Wheel him out in a wheelchair  and it'll get us some sympathy  at the last minute.  Do you know what I'm saying?  Of course.  Oh, I'm there.  Is that what you were saying, too?  And I just repeated it.  I don't know.  Whatever.  Because I'm dumb.  It's all good, man.  Because I'm dumb.  Hey, as we watch  the inauguration coverage,  we've got to get to  the rest of these Bush-isms,  Ant.  They went well earlier  on the show.  We could run out.  We've only got a few more  left here.  Some of the things  Bush said over the years.  Over the years.  Some memorable moments.  That there be a stable Iran.  A Iran that is capable  of rejecting Iranian influence. 
[03:13:30]  I mean, Iraq.  And Iraq.  Fuck.  Unbelievable.  We all do this,  but you hear him  as a montage.  It's quite entertaining.  At the high school level  and find out that  the literacy level  of our children are appalling.  Our literacy level  of our children  are appalling.  Yeah.  They underestimated  the compassion  of our country.  I think they  misunderstood 
[03:14:00]  the will and determination  of the commander-in-chief, too.  Misunderestimated.  There you go.  Nice.  That's cool.  That one took me a minute.  I was like,  what's wrong with that?  Oh, wait.  Okay.  My state of the union  or my speech  of the nation.  Whatever you want to call it.  Whatever you want to call it.  You can call me an alcoholic.  Whatever it is.  Whatever you want to call it.  Yeah. 
[03:14:30]  Jesus.  Tribal sovereignty  means that.  It's sovereign.  You've been given  sovereignty  and you're viewed  as a sovereign entity.  Okay.  And, therefore,  the relationship  between the federal government  and tribes  is one between  sovereign entities.  Oh, God.  He's killing, too,  because you hear people  laughing at him.  Exactly.  They're not even  holding back.  They're just laughing.  If you don't stand 
[03:15:00]  for anything,  you don't stand  for anything.  If you don't stand  for something,  you don't stand  for anything.  You hear the confidence, dude?  This is better  than the 70s porn.  Remember when we  listened to that?  Those laughs.  These are all him  just winking to the side  like,  I can handle this.  Watch.  Watch.  Watch.  You don't stand  for anything.  You don't stand  for anything.  If you don't stand  for anything,  you don't stand  for anything.  Those laughs  are why we're still  in Iraq.  If you guys  just see my laughing,  go fuck you,  fucking cunts.  You want to laugh  at me?  Laugh at me 
[03:15:30]  another fucking year.  Nobody's coming home.  Here's the  stay the course montage.  That's exactly  what I wanted  to ask you about  because James Baker  says that he's  looking for something  between cutting  and stay the course.  Listen,  we've never been  stay the course,  George.  We will stay  the course.  We will stay  the course.  We will stay  the course.  We will stay  the course.  We're just going  to stay the course.  We're going to  stay the course.  We must stay  the course.  We will stay  the course.  This country  we'll stay  the course.  We will stay  the course. 
[03:16:00]  We will stay  the course.  But we will  stay the course.  We'll stay  the course.  We'll stay  the course.  Getting back  to the coverage,  they're saying  thank you to  the instant  feedbackers,  a lot of them.  Chaney pulled  his groin,  that's why  he's in a wheelchair.  I think it's safe  to say we've all  pulled my groin.  I pulled my groin  every day.  We pulled our groin.  It doesn't pull  their fucking groin,  right.  It doesn't pull  itself.  You just deal  with it.  You don't end up  in a wheelchair  over a groin pole.  Absolutely.  You know the big  fucking winner 
[03:16:30]  of this inauguration  coverage is Cadillac.  I have not seen  so many motherfucking  caddies on screen  during any caddy  commercial or anything.  Look at all  the fucking caddies.  Can you imagine  though if Barack  got assassinated,  that'd be the end  of fucking Cadillac?  Wow, right?  What a Cadillac.  Did they put 22s  on the presidential  limo?  Yeah.  Did they slam it  and put 22s  on the spinners?  Look at that  fucking Escalade  and the rocket. 
[03:17:00]  That shit's looking  nice, yo.  Yeah, that's  pimped out  just a little bit.  Pimped my rhyme.  We've got to put  some spinners on there.  They call it the beast.  What up, homo?  Look at those tires.  They call it the beast  for real.  It's definitely  pimped out just a bit.  The flags are  bulletproof  on the side.  Like, you can't  even shoot through  a fucking flag  on the fender.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Like Ant said  during the break,  that looks so thick  and heavy.  It does.  That thing looks like  a freaking coffin. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, the car.  Yeah.  How about you give  that to the fucking  soldiers when they  go driving around  on patrol?  Yeah.  All right, more Bushisms  as we watch the beast  make its way.  It's hard for me  to explain why  that was the case.  Just take my word  for it.  I can't explain it  so just fucking  believe it.  All right, well.  Then go fuck yourself.  Here's one of the  famous ones.  I'm curious.  Have you ever  Googled anybody?  Do you use Google?  Occasionally.  One of the things  I've used on the Google 
[03:18:00]  is to pull up maps.  It's very interesting  to see.  I forgot the name  of the program.  But you get the satellite  and you can,  like I kind of like  to look at the ranch  on Google  and remind me  where I want to be  sometimes.  He's the president  and he doesn't know  it's called Google  The Google.  Fuck.  You know the Google?  The Google?  I forgot the name  of the program.  The name of the program.  The Google.  The Google.  You know the Google map  thing?  I forgot the name.  I think it's called  Google Maps.  It does exactly  what 12-year-old boys  like to do. 
[03:18:30]  I like to see my  satellite.  Putting the the  in front of it  is great.  The Google.  That's great.  That's what old  people do.  That's great.  I hear the kids  are using the Google.  The Google?  The Google?  That Maps program?  I hear there's  rumors on the  internets.  Internets.  It's not just one.  The internets.  He knows about  these secret internets.  I hear there's  rumors on the  internets.  Then I have  filters on 
[03:19:00]  internets.  One of the things  I've used on the  Google is to  pull up maps.  Internets.  Nice.  Jesus Christ.  Oh my God.  It's 2009.  There's no  president that has  I mean you said  earlier we all do  this but I mean  nobody has done  it that much.  You don't think?  In the public  I used to be like  ah they're just  taking all these  dumb things and  putting them all  together.  You could do that  with anybody but  for eight years  every time he  says something.  But I mean  the internets 
[03:19:30]  that takes it  to a whole new  quail used to  really come out  with some funny  shit.  What did  quail used to  say?  Dan quail.  He just would  say dumb  fucking shit.  And he couldn't  spell.  And he couldn't  yeah.  Couldn't spell  and his sayings  like he'd get  he'd try to  he'd try to  like tell you  something that  a famous quote  from years ago  and just fuck  it up.  Was it so  badly?  Was it  oh God  what's his name?  The guy that  fell right off  the stage.  Ford.  Oh no  Ford. 
[03:20:00]  I thought  it was quail.  You know  what I'm  talking about.  It was  like  Bob Dole.  Jesus.  He was  Bob Dole.  Thank you.  Thank you to  Danny.  One of the  famous Dan  Quail ones  was what a  waste it is  to lose  one's mind  or not to  have a mind  as being  very wasteful.  How true  that is.  He was  trying to say  a mind is  a terrible  thing to waste  because he  was speaking  in front of  I think  the United  Negro College  from people  and he was  like mind  is a terrible  thing to lose  when you lose  one's mind. 
[03:20:30]  It's like  what the  fuck are  you saying?  I was  reading that  on Google  maps the  other day.  On the  Google.  On the  internet.  Dan Quail also  said welcome  to President  Bush,  Mrs. Bush  and my  fellow  astronauts.  Jesus Christ.  Did you see  like  fellow  astronauts.  It's just  it's like  it doesn't  exist like  Barack has  some of that  poise but  like the last  few presents  I was watching  Frost Nixon  and it's  like it was  such a cool 
[03:21:00]  movie and  even though  Nixon was a  piece of shit  and a crook  in the end  it's like he  was so poised  he'd say shit  in the movie  where you got  chills where  he was like  we will not  lie down in the  dark.  You know like  it all sounded  like President-y  you know what I  mean?  President-y.  Yeah but like  not like  if you fool me  once fool  won't get  fooled again.  Yeah fucking  Clinton with his  big red face  he's got fucking  crusted semen  on his pants  not President-y  they should have

[03:22:00]  with this one  today?  Families is where  our nation  finds hope  where wings  take dream  where wings  take  it was clipped  too early  where wings  take dream  where wings  take dream  where wings  take dream  that's great  I was raised  in the desert  that was the  funniest part  of that fucking  yeah yeah  fuck up part  did I just  say that?

[03:29:00]  the concept behind it  where you say  well I want to be part  of this historical event  but it's like  going to Times Square  yeah yeah  or New Year's  it's like  you're not part of it  you're just standing there  yeah  there's no human connection  to any of it  it's just  it's not an experience  you're an extra  to make it look better  yeah exactly  pretty much just an extra  yeah your background  it's like  it's pointless  that's it  look at him  oh that's Clarence Thomas  we did it  we did it  yeah  I remember that  that was a great time  with the pubic hair 
[03:29:30]  on the coke  that was a great moment  in black history  if you remember that one  that was fucking  Clarence Thomas hearings  yeah well I did ask her  if it was a pubic hair  on the fucking coke thing  how great is that  can I be a judge please  that is a long time ago  classic  that's gotta be  close to 20 years ago  poor bastard  he probably just went  ew is that a pubic hair  is that a pubic  and she's like that  she fucking spun it all around  everybody wants to play  along at home  the unfortunate thing is  we're in a delay  so  CNN  and MSNBC  pretty much same coverage  and there's David Gregory

[03:48:00]  three of diamonds  not a load  to drop  in the oval office  what is that  is that the lincoln bible  they've been talking about  probably  i don't know  are they already moving in  oh shit  here we go  oh boy  that's not good  they're showing boxes  being loaded or unloaded  at the white house  that's not good  they are  oh shit  that pushes shit  really taking your time  or are they  no moving in  they're shit in  oh no it's going in  alright  that's like fucking  masks and cheekies  oh jeez  they're gonna hang shit up  on the wall 
[03:48:30]  that the white house  has never seen  let's try to keep it  between the lines here  i'm keeping it  between the lines  but you think  fucking ulysses  grant's picture  is still gonna be  hanging in that  motherfucker  you're off-roading  a little bit right  i'm not off-roading  let's keep it  between the ditches  like it would be  horrible for me  to say there's gonna  be african art  on the walls  probably for the  first time ever  that was a nice save  all i was saying  was that these people  have the right  to celebrate their culture  anyway they deem  oh god  they couldn't let you  move the boxes 
[03:49:00]  in before today  they don't have to  worry about  they couldn't  bring the box  or you couldn't  move in tomorrow  during the inauguration  that's what this guy  wants to deal with  that sounds like  it seems to me  to be a security threat  too  excuse me president  obama i know  you have to make  your speech  but uh where  do these sheets go  oh fuck  i should be there  hey do we get  bush uh with the  dramatic shot of him  just getting on  the helicopter today  we get all that  right  hey  does he leave  today like that  oh yeah he's out  unless he wants to  get a room at a hotel  but i mean they're 
[03:49:30]  sold out  comments coming in  where did the sheets  where did the sheets  go line  it should be over  the people's heads  what do you  i want to ask you guys  a question  what do you think of  this  they uh  uh uh  rolling stone has  that cover of bush  he's on the cover  this month  and it says  it says farewell  from bush  the the apology  we wish he would  have given  or whatever  and it made me  start thinking  because in  frost nixon  the whole premise  of the movie  was this guy  frost  going to interview  nixon  and try to get  him to give  this apology 
[03:50:00]  for what he did  that he never gave  and there was all  this clamoring  about it  so i was like  do you think  that's do you think  there's going to be  that clamoring  around bush  that people are  going to be  lining up to try  to get this candid  interview with him  now that he's out  of office  and try to get  him to go  hey i made  some mistakes  his last speech  though he kind  of did uh  fess up to some  of the mistakes  he said history  will judge him  so i don't think  i think in a few  years  um you'll be  able to like  take a uh i think  a more open-minded  view of his  presidency 
[03:50:30]  right uh and  if he wants to  talk then  obama uh obama's  daughters now  they're gonna be  they're gonna be  lookers in a few  years are they  really absolutely  there's the bible  on uh msnbc  we're watching  cnn and msnbc  at the same time  jesus  it is  oh that's  great  yeah i don't  know i'm curious  to see if uh  nah he'll keep  his gap shut  you know i think 
[03:51:00]  he'll just shut  his mouth and  disappear for a  while well i'm  not saying he  won't do that  what i'm what i'm  asking is do you  think that reporters  will be clamoring to  try to get that  interview right now  do you think  they'll be pushing  for it because  everybody pushed  for it with nixon  at least that's  what they said in  the movie and  that's as far as  my research went  just the movie  yeah hey can i  jump in for a  chris uh rab  anthony from  illinois are  they're taking  bush's boxes and  throwing them out  by the dumpster  like it about  schmidt  thank you for the 
[03:51:30]  reference love that  fucking movie  good old jack is  like explaining  everything to the  young guy and he's  like yeah yeah yeah  got it got it got it  got it and there's  his uh lifetime of  work in a dumpster  does that make me  laugh does that  movie not just sum  up life i mean i've  watched that movie so  many times been like  they really nailed  what it's all about  just hey good news  uh the food has  arrived aretha  franklin they're  going to put her  on a spit  and feed the crowd  holy shit how

[03:59:30]  extraordinary country  no place else does this  you mean the emancipation proclamation  where lincoln freed the slaves  to cripple the south  during a war  that's pretty much what he did it for  I like to  I was like  we've come a long way  in a mere 200 years  we let a half black president  be voted in  completely against our fist pounding will  that is a long way  in 146 years 
[04:00:00]  god damn the rosette body  David Gergen  this building  which was  such a lousy president  to sit in there  for 8 years  that we actually vote in  a black man  both buildings  put on the backs of slaves  and yet I think also  overhanging this  Anderson  very much alive  in Barack Obama's mind  is not just the past  but the crisis of the president  I hate that fucking mouth  that Michelle Obama makes  I hate it  it'll be okay  there's Cheney 
[04:00:30]  they're wheeling out Cheney  they're wheeling out Cheney  they're wheeling out Mr. Burns  it would be great  if it hit the steps  like the end of Naked Gun  and he just flew over  roll me out Smithers  he's wondering where  his father's day cake is  that's what he looks like  Bajelia  where's my cake  I think the crowd  is bored at this point  so they should just  throw Dick Cheney to them  and have him crowd circle  the crowd  and they're going to 
[04:01:00]  wheel him out  for the surrounding  Michelle Obama  is not an attractive  fucking woman  she is fucking not  an attractive woman  well  he says  ladies and gentlemen  the president of the  United States  the honorable  George Walker Bush  and the vice president  of the United States  Dick Cheney  accompanied by  Senate Republican leader  Senator Mitch McConnell  Senator Robert Bennett  House Republican leader  Representative John Boehner 
[04:01:30]  and Secretary for the  Minority  David Chiapa  I saw you up there  boy if this doesn't  represent what's happening  they're wheeling  old white guys out  they're just wheeling  old white guys out  like  later  you hear the  smattering of applause  yeah  they turned off the mics  in the crowd  obviously  that is like  that's just the people  right around the main area  yeah right  you don't hear a roar

[04:02:30]  swearing in  March 4, 1861  it's bound in  burgundy velvet  gold washed  white metal rim  around the three edges  outside of both covers  the edges are  gilded heavily  Joe Biden  he's getting ready  to be introduced  as well  the incoming vice president  of the United States  Steny Hoyer  and Harry Reid  will be escorting him  into the chamber  he's going to be introduced  and of course  he will be followed  by the next president  of the United States  Barack Obama  and then the formal  inauguration ceremony 
[04:03:00]  will begin  as I said  with Senator Dianne Feinstein  welcoming everyone  and calling this event  what do you think  Bush is saying right there  this Lincoln Bible  has not been used  in the presidential  inaugural ceremony  since Abraham Lincoln  himself used it  in the library  of Congress  I also want to point out  we saw the first  president Bush  George Herbert Walker  Bush walking out  earlier with a cane  how about that  I'm now told  by Gene Becker  in the former 
[04:03:30]  president's office  that he has actually  used a cane  since his back surgery  in December of 2007  and she wants to  reassure all of us  that former  president Bush  is in no pain  that's the way  he's been  since the back surgery  he'll be training again  in two months  in the vice president  of 2007  100%  coordinator for the joint  congressional committee  on inaugural ceremonies  Jennifer Griffith  senate deputy  sergeant at arms  Drew Willison  house deputy  sergeant at arms  Carrie Hanley  senate majority leader  senator Harry Reid

[04:12:00]  we come here  every four years  to bestow  the power  of the presidency  upon our democratically  elected leader  those who doubt  the supremacy  of the ballot  over the bullet  can never diminish  the power  engendered by non-violent  struggles  for justice  and equality  like the one  that made this day  possible  no trite  tainted by brutality  with some old woman's  fucking dripping 
[04:12:30]  cold nose  yeah  Bush is so happy  like finally  no more approval rating  bullshit  no more war bullshit  I'm done  no more terror  bang out his wife  for the next few years  eat some fucking  barbecue  some fucking  pork rinds  and just  be done with it  yeah  that this  was the moment  yeah  when the dream  that once  we need tight shots  on all the ugliest
