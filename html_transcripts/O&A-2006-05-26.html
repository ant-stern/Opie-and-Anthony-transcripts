<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show on XM 202, a broadcast rife with vulgarity and self-deprecating humor, kicked off with Opie and Anthony's characteristically offensive introductions, introducing their crew (Hurricane Ben, Martini Steve, E-Rock) in equally insulting terms.  Studio guest Drew Boogie provided live mixing of audio segments, including a Steve C. bear impression.  The hosts joked about their new radio gig, working a holiday weekend, with Opie recounting a speeding ticket and Anthony his need for naps.  The recurring "funny or gay" segment launched with Anthony’s embarrassing Mets game marshmallow incident and his Yankee/Red Sox ticket birthday gift from CBS Radio.

Opie detailed his own Mets game experiences, including autographing "wow" bumper stickers, leaving early, and accidentally holding his producer Danny's hand instead of Lindsay's, sparking further "funny or gay" discussion and a subsequent awkward high-five with Danny during a home run.  Anthony then shared his suburban move woes, including awkward encounters with his Jewish neighbors and a hilarious home invasion scare where the "intruder" turned out to be his girlfriend's email notification.  He also recounted a neighborhood encounter with a young fan, weaving in tangents about his WWII attire fascination, his night vision monocle for observing cruise ship balcony sex, and several calls with technical difficulties.  The segment ended with more discussion of Anthony's paranoia and Drew Boogie's birthday, with upcoming guests Jeffrey Ross and Bob Kelly mentioned.

The next segment began with a humorous bit involving a phone call supposedly from Anthony Cumia’s boyfriend, followed by discussion of Cumia’s creepy self-recorded MySpace video.  A Walmart “foot-licker” news story led to anecdotes about unusual sexual encounters. A caller, Rory, faced technical difficulties.  The Blue Angels flyover prompted a lengthy, profane digression on the homoerotic subtext of *Top Gun*, complete with impersonations and detailed scene analysis.  Listener calls regarding *Top Gun* and Opie's Mets game hand-holding incident followed.  Studio guests Bob Kelly and Drew Boogie (celebrating his birthday) were present.  Jeffrey Ross’s *Patriot Act* documentary, filmed during a USO tour in Iraq, was discussed, along with positive reviews and clips of Rich Vos's stand-up.  The hosts expressed frustration with the absent CBS Radio management.

Comedian Jimmy Norton, fresh from a USO tour in Iraq, detailed the troops' overwhelmingly positive reactions, reducing his cynicism and boosting his patriotism.  He contrasted this with the public's apathy towards the Iraq War, attributing it to a lack of perceived direct threat, unlike WWII.  He promoted his *Baghdad Ha Ha* documentary.  Jeffrey Ross joined in studio, promoting *Patriot Act* and his upcoming MTV cartoon, *Where Are My Dogs At*, with Tracy Morgan. An old, embarrassing broadcast clip was played. A listener who served in Iraq called to express gratitude.  A significant portion involved an impromptu studio-to-XM walk, marked by interactions with passersby, including a sexually charged encounter with a young woman and her boyfriend.  The walk involved off-color humor, discussions of sex and bodily functions, racial slurs, comments on Robin Williams's hairiness, a listener’s HR issues related to imitating Norton’s bathroom antics, and a call about a leniently sentenced child molester.  Norton received a bizarre “Sweetest Boy in Studio” trophy.

The final segment was chaotic and sexually explicit. It featured a male guest, Jimmy, repeatedly touching his genitals on-air. The "Daily Dump Report" detailed instances of offensive language and sexual acts, naming several individuals including Artie Lange, Howard Stern, and Jeff Ross.  The hosts discussed a censored Stress Factory radio commercial and its revisions.  Listener calls involving offensive and sexually explicit content were included, including one about sinus surgery and another about masturbation in a library.  The "Hottest Girl on Paltalk" contest was discussed.  Bob Kelly was a studio guest throughout.  The segment was characterized by interruptions, crude jokes, vulgar language, and references to online message boards.

The penultimate segment included Bob Kelly and covered emails, MySpace, and a dildo contest announcement. Upcoming guests (Kevin Smith, Otto and George, Bill Burr, Billy Connolly) and Lee Evans were mentioned.  A discussion about 3D movies devolved into talk of Rich Voss’s ear cyst and unsanitary 3D glasses.  A heated exchange between Opie and Bob Kelly regarding their physiques ensued.  Callers, Derek (a bad colonic joke), Jeff (a “dumpster fuck” joke), and John (correctly identifying an autoclave) contributed to the conversation, leading to Anthony's gross-out colonoscopy story and discussion of Jimmy Norton’s body fat distribution.  Beth from North Carolina played "What's in My Pants," a sexually suggestive game.  The show concluded with plugs and vulgar jokes, ending with a spoken-word poem about Ben Sparks.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM 202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Push the button!  Can you hear me?  No!  Shut up!  Opie and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow.  We're dummies.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony. 
[00:00:30]  Opie.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  Jeez.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slumped, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  He's like Chuck.  No, that's...  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating fool that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care. 
[00:01:00]  Shut up.  No.  What's wrong, Eric?  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian House.  Shut up!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  But enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  I'll see you next time. 
[00:01:30]  I'll see you next time. 
[00:02:00]  That can mean only one thing.  That's right.  Drew Boogie in-house today.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:02:30]  We always love having Drew in before vacation of any sort on a Friday.  And that was a nice Steve one.  Our own Steve C featured in that little mix.  He's scratching live.  Drew comes in, brings his stuff, and scratches live.  And there's a little bit of Steve C doing his little bear impression. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, he takes the sounds from the Opie and Anthony Show and then does a great job mixing them.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I have tried to do that.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Can't do it.  No.  Not like the master Steve.  It's Friday.  All right.  Friday.  It's Friday.  Right off the bat, some guy from Texas.  Yes, it's that DJ guy. 
[00:03:30]  Thanks for working today, boys.  Ain't it nice to be recognized, Drew?  It's that DJ guy.  His name is Drew Boogie, and he's blowing up.  Trust me on that.  His name is Drew Boogie.  His name is Drew Boogie.  He'll be doing this in and out at breaks for us all morning long.  Yes, we're working today.  Ghost town.  And there still will be somebody bitching and complaining that we don't work hard enough,  even though we're doing about five and a half hours of radio a day.  We really wanted to take today off, but it's too new. 
[00:04:00]  We thought better of it.  We said, you know something?  We're just starting a new job.  You don't go taking days off like that.  We are radio pioneers.  We have conquered satellite radio.  Now we're going to go back to regular radio as well and conquer that.  Yes.  So you can't just take a day off right out of the box.  We've only been here a month.  A month today, by the way, I think we took on this new project.  Fighting a two-fronted war.  What are we going to do?  Relax? 
[00:04:30]  Take the day off?  No.  We will Monday, though.  Yeah.  Monday.  We have to, I think.  It's the law.  The Memorial Day police come and arrest you if you're working Monday.  That's right.  But people have stretched it out to the four-day weekend.  You know, and they start to Friday.  And God bless you if that's you.  Congrats.  Have fun.  Because driving in this morning, piece of cake.  Oh, 90.  90 miles an hour.  Didn't have to worry about anyone else on the road. 
[00:05:00]  No annoying people in the left lane.  And if there was one guy, middle and right lane, totally clear for the sweep.  So I barely even had to slow down.  Very good.  I have to slow down when you go into that tunnel.  Because hitting the tunnel at about 90, it's like Battlestar Galactica when they leave that ship.  You just see, wah, lights going past you.  Lights in the wall going flying by you, right?  Yeah.  1-866-313-FREE is the phone number here.  1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:05:30]  Drew Boogie, everyone.  Thanks a lot, Drew.  Absolutely.  I'm a little tired.  I didn't take my nap yesterday.  This morning radio.  Like old men with the frigging naps.  Oh, it's so pathetic.  Because, you know, we get done at, what, around noon every day.  Yeah.  Because we have to do stuff after the show, blah, blah, blah.  So we finally get to go home at noon.  And I know people out there are like, oh, noon.  Poor baby.  But the only way this, like, morning radio thing works when you're getting up at four in the morning is you got to take a little nappy. 
[00:06:00]  Sometimes, yeah.  Well, yeah.  Or sometimes you rough it and stick it out.  And that's what I did yesterday because I had great tickets to the Mets game.  Oops.  What happened to your team?  Well, the Phillies beat them yesterday, yes.  But, so I couldn't take my nap.  So I'm a little groggy right now.  Croggy?  Waking up with the coffee and all that.  And it sucks because you go home and it's a beautiful spring day.  It's 80.  You hear the people outside and you have to go and take your nappy. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  It's so pathetic.  Got to snooze.  You enjoyed the afternoon, though, the ball game thereof?  I did.  What happened to Jim?  Overslept.  Jimmy overslept.  All right.  Jim Norton is on his way.  That prostitute payer forer.  Anyway, well, I did enjoy the Mets game yesterday.  But I have to ask the audience.  I have to ask Anthony and whoever else wants to listen. 
[00:07:00]  I have a funny or gay.  You want to explain funny or gay?  It comes up on the show from time to time.  Well, there's sometimes things that happen between two men, intentional or not.  And sometimes.  Not even two men.  Sometimes it's a group of men.  Right.  Exactly.  Sometimes a girl could even be involved, which.  I don't know how that works.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  I think it's always men.  See, I'm trying to make it almost cooler. 
[00:07:30]  No, never cool.  Just funny or gay.  Never cool.  Right.  So funny or gay is the situation that happened.  Even though there are these gay undertones to the whole thing.  Is it funny or gay?  Does the funny part of it outweigh the slight gayness that it might have in it?  Right.  Exactly.  To make it funny and kind of wipe the slate clean of any of the gay. 
[00:08:00]  Well, I had one of those moments at the Mets game yesterday.  I had a gangbang from the entire Mets team.  No, because that would be gay.  Well, I decided to pick up marshmallows in front of the entire Mets team.  That would be gay.  I thought it'd be funny.  They yelled gay.  No.  You're a man taking on the entire team.  It's gay.  I had great box seats right off first base.  Thanks to the fine people over here at CBS Radio.  It was my birthday gift. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, look at that.  Isn't that nice?  Well, yes.  One of the two companies gave me a birthday gift.  And you know what I like about CBS Radio?  They're like grandma.  They're like grandma.  Because I remember grandma would come over for my brother's birthday or my sister's birthday or my birthday and give us a lovely present.  But then even though it was just one of our birthdays, everyone got a gift because grandma was sweet that way.  You know what I had on my desk this morning when I walked in? 
[00:09:00]  What?  I have four Yankee Red Sox tickets.  Holy crap.  I'm a huge Yankee fan.  Shut up.  Are you kidding?  You know what, though?  I'm a Mets fan.  I'm not going to jump on the bandwagon.  Finally, we have a team this year.  You do?  But everyone who knows the radio program, I've been a Mets fan my entire life.  And, you know, I was never going to jump on the Yankee bandwagon when they were doing all those World Series and, you know, doing just unbelievable. 
[00:09:30]  It's a majority of the Mets fans.  They're very loyal to their team.  And this year they got a good team.  And they should be proud and happy.  But if there's any game I want to see, it's a Yankee Red Sox game.  See, that's what it is.  It doesn't even matter if you're a Yankee fan.  I would see steam shovels against the Red Sox.  I would see children throwing rocks against the Red Sox.  Anything where the Red Sox might get hurt in some way, shape, or form, physically or mentally, I want to be there. 
[00:10:00]  It's the best rivalry in baseball and possibly in sports.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  So you had a pair or four tickets for a Yankee Red Sox game.  A Yankee Red Sox game.  It is on a school night.  It starts at 730.  Oh, boy.  But I figure I'll get a room in town here somewhere and then we'll leave the game.  You'll be fine.  Go right to the hotel.  Be fine.  I got four tickets for the Mets and Barry Bonds on Sunday.  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, they're taking care of us over here. 
[00:10:30]  Well, I think it's because CBS broadcasts all the Major League Baseball games, I think, right?  Well, you would think we would get the baseball tickets from XM because they have Major League Baseball.  They have every Major League Baseball game on XM.  But we're getting our baseball tickets from CBS Radio.  It's like, hey, we'll supply you at the games.  Find your tickets somewhere else, people.  Yeah, thanks a lot.  Thank you so much.  So I'm at the Mets game and I got these great, unbelievable box seats.  Got to say hi to all the fans that were sitting around me. 
[00:11:00]  I think we're blowing up.  I think people are listening to us.  Yeah, I'm kind of noticing things happening out there.  I kind of forget and I'm just trying to walk to my seat and it's just like, hey, welcome back.  I'm like, welcome back.  We've been doing radio for almost two years.  I've been getting the weird stare and the turnaround look.  Yeah.  And I can't even be a real celebrity.  I can't even pull it off because I was walking down the sidewalk yesterday and two guys are walking toward me. 
[00:11:30]  And they fit the demo, you know, and they kind of one guy looks at me and I see him turn to his friend and say something.  And then they both like look and I saw him like say Opie and Anthony.  So I pass him by and I couldn't just keep walking.  I had it like turn my head and they were both turning their heads, looking back at me.  It's like I'm the worst at being the cool celebrity guy. 
[00:12:00]  I can't pull it off.  I was I was signing wild bumper stickers in the parking lot of Shea Stadium, by the way.  Oh, they were on cars, but I was signing.  Oh, is that it?  They're already stuck to people's vehicle.  I was writing.  Hey, you get away from my car.  Well, I was impressed by the amount of wow stickers in the Shea Stadium parking lot.  Yeah.  And I decided, you know, because it was rush hour, I'm going to get killed for this.  But I decided to leave in the ninth inning, even though the Mets still had a chance to come back. 
[00:12:30]  You're not even a fan.  You left before the game ended.  I know, but I had it on the radio.  But I want to beat the I want to beat the crowd out.  Plus, it's rush hour to just two whammies.  So I'm walking through the parking lot back to my car and I'm seeing these wow stickers.  I'm like, oh, what the hell?  So I'm signing.  I'm saying.  Opie was here giving the date.  So if you have one of those.  Jack has wrote on my sticker.  So if you have one of those, it was me signing him.  I was just beating an ass.  Hold on.  Mike on Long Island here. 
[00:13:00]  Mike, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  Hey there, Mike.  Hey, I just...  Mike.  What do you say there, Bill?  Mikey.  We paint each other up, Mike.  Me and you.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, fellas.  How you doing?  Hey, good.  Good, Mike.  Hey, I just want...  I wanted to talk about the Mets Sox fan phenomena.  Yeah.  About how Opie should be commended for sticking with the Mets, but there's a whole slew of  guys out there that are Mets Sox fans.  And then secondly, I wanted to talk about how if the Red Sox were playing the Taliban, 
[00:13:30]  I would probably cheer for the Taliban.  A Taliban-Sox game?  That's a Red Sox hater right there.  Thank you, Mike.  So, yeah, I have these great box seats, and then Mark Turnoff comes down to see how the  seats are and stuff, and we're chatting.  We're chit-chatting.  A little chit-chat.  And then he's like, hey, you want to go upstairs and watch Mike and the Mad Dog call the game?  Mike and the Mad Dog call in a Mets game yesterday.  How'd that go?  They work on sports radio here in New York City, but as a promotion, they got him to 
[00:14:00]  call the game yesterday, a one-time thing.  And I was like, yeah, I'll go say hi to those guys.  And Mark Turnoff's saying, well, Mike thinks you hate them.  I'm like, I don't hate those guys.  Hate them.  We competed against them back in the day, and we kicked their ass.  We stole Mike's wine.  And we stole his wine at a club on Long Island.  And because the guy that owned the club, you know how you go to some of these clubs, and  they have these big lockers.  Right.  And they're labeled who owns them. 
[00:14:30]  And inside is like rare wines.  And when the people go there, celebrities usually, they ask for the wine.  I don't even know if the place is still there.  It's like a cigar bar lounge.  Yeah, I think it's gone.  So if you're like a bigwig, you can buy one of these lockers.  So when you go there, you already have your wine and cigar.  So I guess you're actually paying for the locker itself.  Yeah.  And they also have a bar there in case you don't have what you need in your locker.  Have your own wine.  So this guy is like, hey, check it out.  Mike Frances's locker.  It's his locker, dude. 
[00:15:00]  Look, his wine's in there.  I'm like, wow, man.  Can we drink his wine?  Crack that open.  I kind of was joking.  He goes, yeah, why not?  He gets the key and opens up Mike Frances's locker.  And we drank all his wine.  We drank a couple bottles of really nice wine and handed out the cigars to the boys and had  a good night.  I must have pissed him off when he came in.  And he's like, where's my wine?  Yeah.  I've seen somebody lift the wine there, Mikey.  So anyway, Mark Turnoff's like, you want to go up to one of the suites? 
[00:15:30]  You know, they have a suite at Shea Stadium as well that they give to clients.  I'm like, yeah, let's check out the game from up above now because we sat in the box seats  for about six innings.  I'm like, yeah, let's go check it out.  You know, and they have food and beer up there, right?  So I get out of my seats.  I'm way down close to the field.  So I have to walk up and then I have to walk to my right to the exit.  It's a long walk in front of a ton of Mets fans.  A ton of Mets fans.  And quite frankly, a lot of O&A fans.  Yeah.  On Opie, you know, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:16:00]  Where's Anthony?  All that, right?  So I'm with Lindsay and I'm with Danny.  Danny goes to the game.  So I turn as I'm starting my walk.  I turn and I grab Lindsay's hand, right?  Yeah.  And we start walking.  And now it's getting, you know, very tight.  So she's behind me, but I have her hand.  So then I reach back lovingly and I grab her other hand.  You know how you do that, right?  You do the two-hand grab from behind you.  The two-hand grab from behind. 
[00:16:30]  And now I'm walking with what I think is Lindsay's hands.  Yeah.  And I'm walking through the crowd, right?  And then she lets go.  So now I'm only holding one of her hands.  Right.  And I'm really into it.  You know, I had a really good day and I'm like just holding her hand and walking us out  of the place so we could go up into the suite.  Yep.  Just as I get to the, what is it called?  The exit or whatever.  And now no one sees you anymore.  I turn because now I could like, you know, kind of pull her, you know, to my side. 
[00:17:00]  Yep.  And that's when I find out it was Danny.  You had been holding Danny's hand.  Through the crowd.  Walked through the crowd.  Oh my God.  How embarrassing.  They set me up so bad.  They set me up so effing bad.  Bravo, Danny.  Why, thank you.  So what happened was.  Wow, that is embarrassing as all hell.  So what happened was when I turned and grabbed Lindsay's hand, I had Lindsay's hand.  Yeah.  And now I'm turning around and I'm walking us out and she's behind me. 
[00:17:30]  You go for the double hold.  When I go for the double hold, it's not Lindsay's second hand.  Danny grabs on at that point.  So for a little while I was holding Lindsay's hand and Danny's hand.  Lindsay, who has a great sense of humor, realizes what's going on here and lets go.  Let go, man.  And now I'm really feeling the moment like, oh, this is such a cool thing.  Was he taking his thumb and kind of rubbing your hand, Danny?  I don't think I was.  So if I was doing it, I was doing it subconsciously. 
[00:18:00]  So now I'm holding Danny's hand through the entire, not the entire crowd, but the entire section.  Do you know what people must have thought that no you.  No one took a picture.  And they're looking going, why is he holding that man's hand and walking him upstairs?  And it was like, oh, my God, that is so funny and gay.  So and then the laughter, it was just unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  When I turn around, like, you got to be kidding me.  And I'm like, I didn't even notice, like, your calloused hand. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Come on, dude.  I didn't even notice.  So and then then on the way home, Danny brought up a little something and he's completely right.  We had an awkward home run high five moment.  OK, can we just delete that from any recording of this show?  Stop it.  You didn't high five.  I was really into being there because I haven't been to a Mets game in a few seasons now.  A big fan I am.  I know.  But but I haven't been to a game. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, my God.  I was too busy traveling around America when we weren't doing radio.  And and since, you know, going back to radio 18, 19 months ago for XM first, I just haven't had time.  Up top, Danny.  Yeah.  Up top, Big D.  So it happened.  It happened.  And I thought nothing of it.  But on the way home, he had acknowledged, you know, we had an awkward high five home run moment.  But high fiving someone during the home run moment is gayer than holding his hand for the walk to the box. 
[00:19:30]  Well, I'll tell you what happened.  Who we don't.  Who we don't.  I think it was Reyes.  Yeah.  Unless it was Danny.  You shouldn't have high fives.  I'll tell you what happened.  We're in the box seats, though.  And home run.  Right.  Everyone jumps up.  And I realize I'm a pretty good sports fan.  When I when I get into my team, you should see me at the honor games.  I go nuts.  Right.  And so the home run is hit.  And now I jump up.  And now I'm looking around.  Oh, usually I'm with a family member or something.  I don't care.  I could I know I could yell no homo and everything's cool. 
[00:20:00]  Right.  So I turn to my right and it's a box filled with ONA fans.  I'm like, I'm not I'm not high fiving these guys.  No.  So then I turn to my left and Lindsay's like still sitting on our hands because she's a Phillies fan.  So she's not getting up.  Yeah.  So then I turn around because now I'm up.  It's awkward.  Oh, my God.  You're looking around for the high five person.  It's kind of like when you go to church and you have to do the sign of peace and look around awkwardly to your neighbor.  You look around awkwardly. 
[00:20:30]  You got to shake someone's hand.  Peace be with you.  Right.  Peace be with you.  So then I turn around and it's Danny.  And were you up?  I think you were up.  He was up because he's a big Mets fan, too.  So I look at him.  He looks at me.  I'm like, what the hell?  I didn't even actually think it out.  But after the fact, I now realize it was just a bad.  Oh.  And we high five.  Well, all right.  Slow down.  Did you miss?  Did you catch the side of each other's hands and make it like a half ass high five, which  is the worst ever? 
[00:21:00]  The best is that it's not like we both made eyes and was like, yeah, you know, and we  both went up at the same time.  He's just like standing up with his hand out.  Oh, no, like someone please high five me.  I'm like, all right, now I have to do this because I can't just leave the boss man hanging.  Oh, no.  I'm like, well, this is awkward, isn't it?  It was like an episode of The Office where the boss takes you to the game.  Come on, up top.  Come on, one up top.  We're here enjoying the game.  You want a hot dog? 
[00:21:30]  Some people are calling it Opie's Brokeback Baseball.  Well, there you have it.  Home run, home run.  Danny, hold me.  Oh, are they hammering you?  So then Danny's like, yeah, you know, we did have that awkward home run high five moment  there in the game.  I'm like, yeah, I guess.  Because it's not like me and the Oapster are hanging out every Friday night, going clubbing  and everything.  So that was as comfortable as it was going to get. 
[00:22:00]  Hot dogs, hot dogs, peanuts, peanuts, get your peanuts.  Bikini teenies.  Bikini, two down here.  All right.  Two bikini teenies.  All right.  All right.  Come on, up top.  All right.  Where you get, I love that.  When you get the high two, it's like you miss and only two of your fingers make contact with  the other guy.  The slip, it doesn't make that snapping noise.  It's too bad we got to take a break.  Oh, how awkward.  It's too bad we have to take a break.  Yeah.  It's a shame. 
[00:22:30]  Well, it's too bad because the phones are just going nuts right now.  Jim in Albany, what's up?  Hey, Opie, is Danny's hands as soft as Lindsay's?  I know.  How you mistake Lindsay's, like, Lindsay's got, like, elegant hands and those mitts that  you can only call, like, mitts.  What are you, Italian?  What are you?  Uh, actually, like, European, like, Russian Jew.  Russian Jew.  You got a little bit of everything.  Those working mitts.  See, the Jew part gives them soft hands. 
[00:23:00]  Is that what it is?  Let's be honest.  From cutting money all your life, Mr. Hooper.  Let's be honest.  No, they did the old switch.  So, psychologically, I'm thinking I'm holding both of Lindsay's hands.  Yeah.  You can see it my way, right, Ant?  Not at all.  What's wrong with Lindsay's right hand?  This is, ooh, I'm going to have to get her some lotion.  Let's go to Charlie in Philly.  Charlie, Charlie.  You got bricklayer hands.  Charlie, make it fast.  Hooper and Anthony, how are you guys doing this morning?  Good, man.  All right, Charlie. 
[00:23:30]  Hey, I got to say it's both, because day is funny.  Hey, after the half a high five, did you guys smack each other on the tush, too?  All right, all right.  Did you give me a little pat on the ass?  Look, I call no homo.  Simple as that.  Yeah, you got to.  I'm calling no homo.  Justin on Long Island, what's up?  Hey, boys, what's going on?  Hey.  I got to stand up for Opie for a second.  I remember I caught AIDS watching a young Italian man do a pirouette on an HBO special.  You remember that one, A?  You homo.  I wasn't a pirouette.  I did a bow from medieval times. 
[00:24:00]  Right, right.  I bowed to the audience.  All right.  At Jimmy's show.  Well, I would love to take more phone calls, but obviously, there's something wrong with  them.  There's some kind of weird feedback going on.  There's a weird thing, which means some button is pushed that's feeding something back.  I don't know.  We'll deal with it during break.  And Jimmy has arrived.  Drew Boogie in house.  Jimmy!  We're going to take our first break.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Remind me, in the next break, we've got to play some of the homeless radio we did yesterday. 
[00:24:30]  You want to hold Danny's hand while we go?  No, it's all right.  High five.  Come on, up top.  Now I have to tell Jimmy what happened.  First break was good.  Come on, up top.  Now I have to tell Jimmy what happened after the break.  He's going to stink.  Because he's going to want to jump on the pile, I'm sure.  Of course.  All right.  Drew Boogie, everyone.  All right. 
[00:25:00]  I want to be here. 
[00:25:30]  Hello?  Well, I want to call my man.  Hello?  I want to be here.  I want to call my man.  This will be my desk in morning. 
[00:26:00]  Now this is the wrong bell.  Oh, my God.  Who is this?  Oh, no.  Who is this?  Oh, my God. 
[00:26:30]  Where did this happen?  Where?  Where?  Where?  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show, doing something a little different today.  We got Drew Boogie in studio, scratching some of the fine sounds from the Opie and Anthony  program.  1-866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-FREE.  I'm getting killed on the instant feedback. 
[00:27:00]  Eh, not really.  Just a couple coming in.  A couple of comments.  Bill from Waterford.  Hey, Opie.  When Danny left his seat, did you jingle your keys to help him find his section?  Nice call back from yesterday's show, my friend.  Very nice.  Yep, yep, yep, yep.  Hey, Opie.  Why don't you hold Danny's hog on the walk to XM today, fag?  Do the elephant walk?  Danny says thumbs up.  And another guy wants to know if when you found that he was holding your hand, if you 
[00:27:30]  leaned over and said, can I...  Did they show Danny and Opie kissing on the jumbotron?  All right.  Easy.  Easy.  In the big heart.  Easy.  Like, they put the big heart and look for the couple.  Easy.  So, yeah, people just commented.  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  Let's say...  And feedback.  Let's say hi to no homo.  No homo.  No homo.  Hey, good morning.  No homo.  Hey, good morning.  I told him.  Yeah, we have a problem with the phones because, you know, it's feeding back, right?  So, uh, whatever.  I said, no, it's not going to work that way.  He says, yes, it is.  So, now I push him back down.  So, it will work.  No homo?  Are you there, no homo?  No homo?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But now we get that sound.  Now it's screechy.  But to fix that sound, I have to do this, but then the caller can't hear us.  No homo?  No homo.  Hey, I'm here, man. 
[00:28:30]  What's up?  How you doing, O&J?  Oh, come on, man.  The phones.  We need the phones today.  Isn't that odd that we get, that's happened everywhere we've worked?  I can say.  Opie, can you hear me?  Uh, yes.  Go ahead.  No homo.  Okay.  Opie, I've been listening to you for eight months now.  And I'm used to you being angry Opie, psycho Opie.  You have turned into quite the comedian the last couple of weeks, and I just wanted to  know if I could just kiss your ass, no homo. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, thank you, sir.  I appreciate it.  I appreciate it.  I would talk to you more, but the phones, I don't know what's going on.  We got some feedback.  And we really need our phones today.  We need them.  We're off to a great start.  We love the phones.  We love when our listeners participate.  Well, they're looking at the board right now, so hopefully we'll have them fixed.  Really fast, Anthony had a neighbor moment.  Yeah, it was just quick.  I love my suburban neighborhood.  We like going into Anthony's neighborhood every once in a while, because if you know anything 
[00:29:30]  about Anthony, and now there's people in Pittsburgh and West Palm Beach, they don't  really know us yet.  No.  But we're being heard finally back in Philly and Boston and other places where they know  a lot about us.  The people in, like, Boston and Worcester, they kind of know, like, where I came from.  Really?  I lived in Ashland, Mass.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I lived in Ashland, Mass.  Nuff said.  I lived in a housing complex amongst the Brazilians, where they were actually, they had chickens 
[00:30:00]  on their patios.  And, yeah.  So I finally decided very recently to grow up.  And by very recently, I mean, three months ago or so.  And I decided to make my first ever house purchase.  And I moved to a neighborhood that is full, chock full of Jews.  Because, and I'm a Catholic, Roman Catholic guy.  But I just love the Jews in the neighborhood. 
[00:30:30]  Because the lawns are perfectly kept by Mexican landscapers.  They're nice.  You know, they give a little wave, howdy neighbor.  They all own nice cars and everything.  That's what I, just a nice suburban neighborhood.  That's what I like.  And, you know, I've made contact with the next door neighbor a little bit.  And there's kind of some scuttlebutt around the neighborhood about me.  And I guess they're talking amongst themselves.  If it's a good thing that I live there. 
[00:31:00]  They have a little gossip.  Which is just part of suburbia.  They're going to be all gossipy.  You know, but no harm done.  And it's not like living in the city where a pizza delivery guy comes to your house and gets shot in the face and robbed.  That's, that, or there's roaches.  Ugh.  It's just weird because you don't want to communicate with anybody, really.  Let's be honest.  No, that's the hardest part.  I'm very, uh.  And we get these updates from kind of time.  You've had the neighbors come over with, like, baked goods. 
[00:31:30]  Baked goods.  They're very nice of them.  Invite them in or not.  I don't know the protocol.  You're just taking their baked goods at the front door and pretty much slamming the door in their face.  All right, come on, come on, come on, come on.  But finally you invited them in for a quick moment.  No, I never invited them in.  Oh, I thought you did, no?  No, one time they were going to a movie when we did invite them in and told them we have nothing here.  I mean, we just moved in.  And then after a while they gave us some more time, came over with some baked goods.  And, uh, I guess we were supposed to invite them in and make some coffee and then share the baked goods.  But we kind of just grabbed the baked goods, shut the door, and that was it. 
[00:32:00]  With the chain still on the lock.  And then, yeah, the chain.  Hello, what do you want?  Yeah, they're just squishing the muffins through the little space that you allow.  Not even open the door.  Through the intercom.  Hello, what do you want?  Hi, it's your neighbors.  Whatever you got, leave it on the mat and go away.  And let me see your hands.  Let me see your hands as you're back away from the door.  I'm not a very social person, and throughout my life, in my living circumstances, I don't know how to socialize.  I just have a great visual of them with a, I'll call it a bunt cake. 
[00:32:30]  It wasn't a bunt cake.  And you only give them like two inches, so they're just shoving the cake through that.  But bring, cut it, cut it into slivers and slide it under the door.  Do you think one of them is ever walking their door at like nine at night, and it's all dark outside, so the light in your apartment is illuminated at your house.  And they look through the crack, and they just see you in that Nazi jacket marching around your living room, talking to yourself.  And your underpants, you're just wearing the top half of the uniform. 
[00:33:00]  Look, I hope, I certainly hope no one, I don't wear a Nazi uniform around the house.  I don't own a Nazi uniform.  He only waits for the full moon.  I am a fan.  So he doesn't have to turn his lights on so people aren't on to him.  I am a fan of the 40s and the war era.  Black socks, halfway up his thighs.  I own a British Enfield rifle.  It was a Nazi killer.  I don't own Nazi paraphernalia.  Shut up, we're trying to envision what you look like.  I'm thinking black socks, halfway up his calves, his underpants, not boxer briefs, but underpants, tightly cropped. 
[00:33:30]  With the socks?  He has the socks, he has the little thing that holds them on to his calves?  And then only the top half of the uniform.  And he's on the porch with a broomstick, like it's a rifle, and he's just holding them.  I know.  And they walk by and they go, Anthony?  I don't.  They were such snappy dressers, weren't they?  Snappy dressers.  Well, come on.  Now, they were.  You've got to give them that.  I did have a little bit of a frightening moment there last night. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, what happened?  Well, I was alone last night.  My girlfriend went out shopping.  And I'm alone in the house.  So I'm just kind of laying in bed.  Why am I alone?  Why am I alone?  I'm watching TV.  And I hear a door open.  I hear a little creak like a, and I look at the alarm and I realize, oh my God, I hadn't  set the alarm.  Now, I tripped up. 
[00:34:30]  I didn't set the alarm and I hear a door, distinctly hear a creak of a door opening.  And it's very loud.  So I know it's not the TV.  It's not some neighbor thing.  Please tell me you almost shot an innocent victim.  Dude, I go right for the gauge.  Right for the 12.  I put on my jammy pants and now I realize I still have no curtains up.  So if anybody's looking at the house, they're looking at a lunatic in his pajama bottoms, 
[00:35:00]  toting a 12 gauge down his stairs, yelling, you best come out, mother effer, or you're  dead.  You do know this was all in your mind, right?  No, no, no.  It was a creaking door.  There was.  It was a creaking door.  Sure it was, Anthony.  Sure it was.  So I'm sneaking around the house with the shotgun, like, you know, checking the basement or  anywhere else.  Maybe they, you know, came in through a basement window and opened the basement door somehow.  You know, I'm just kind of, you know, going over everything, checking every corner of the 
[00:35:30]  house.  You're not kind of just checking anything when you have a shotgun.  Well, yes, I was, I was prepared to kill somebody if I would have seen them in there  and they perhaps weren't white.  I'm, I'm, I'm kidding.  Now, stop it.  Inappropriate.  I'm kidding.  Of course.  If they did not belong there.  Can I jump in for one second?  Craig, go ahead.  Opie.  Craig.  What's going on?  Hello? 
[00:36:00]  We still have to do this.  Craig.  Yeah.  All right.  What's up?  You're starting to worry me, man.  Why?  Well, you know, you're holding hands with Danny, the mess game.  And this morning night, you're picturing Anthony walking through his house, black socks and  underwear.  Well, cause we think he's nuts.  Yeah.  Everyone thinks I'm crazy.  Yeah.  But the phone's still.  I, I'm really not.  And, and, and I, I checked the house, uh, while toting my, my 12 gauge and, uh, it was  clear.  So I gave myself the all clear, all clear, all clear and, uh, went upstairs. 
[00:36:30]  And as I'm walking back up the, uh, the stairs, please tell me someone scared you and  you, and you shot a hole in your, no, you would have loved that.  Wouldn't you fireplace?  Also his girlfriend comes in.  Hey, big, huge hole.  And here's the thing.  I had just called my girlfriend and she was having dinner.  So I knew that she wasn't the one that was coming home. 
[00:37:00]  So I knew everything, you know, if, if someone's coming through my door, they don't belong in  the house and I'm not a shoot first kind of guy.  And make my take out a kneecap, but you know, I'm not going to kill the guy right away.  I'll wait and call some hard pipe hitting niggas.  Come over with a blow torch and a pair of pliers.  I walk up with the shotgun over my shoulder and I could, because now the house is clear.  So I could just kind of walk upstairs and I hear the door. 
[00:37:30]  It's my girlfriend's computer.  It has a sound prompt when she gets an email that makes the sound of a creaking door opening  and closing.  And that is what I was hunting down in my house last night.  Please tell me you blew away the computer.  I turned and fired.  What did he look like?  I need a new Dell monitor.  He was a little yellow man.  And whenever the American online came on, he would run quickly across my screen. 
[00:38:00]  He had no hands or feet.  It was a little dog and he wanted to answer my questions with a paper clip.  It was a tough shot, but I finally got him.  The talking paper clip upset me and I had to shoot.  You know what's going to happen?  One day he's going to get broken into and he's going to point the gun and they're going  to walk up and go, give me that gun.  And he's going to go, stay back, stay back, and just take it from him.  No, I will shoot to kill.  I'm protecting me and my own.  I, you know, I'm protecting my house. 
[00:38:30]  You realize what it was.  You just kind of returned to your post.  I returned to my post back on my patio.  No, I put the 12 back.  I hadn't even racked it yet.  It wasn't even around in the chamber.  I was waiting.  That's a dramatic moment.  Nice.  It scares everybody away.  But that was after I had my neighborly moment.  Young lad, as I pulled up in the driveway, bouncing a basketball down the street.  This is a lovely suburban neighborhood I live in. 
[00:39:00]  Doink, doink.  He's just bouncing a basketball.  And I get out of my vehicle and he goes, you're Anthony.  He's about 10 or 11 or something like that.  I go, yeah.  Yeah, hi.  Hi.  And he just keeps going.  I go, what's your name?  He goes, Billy.  I live over there.  Doink, doink.  I go, well, it's nice to meet you, Billy.  Yeah.  Nice to meet you.  Doink, doink, doink.  Down there.  And I'm just thinking, what a wonderful neighborhood this is, where you could just see scenes of 
[00:39:30]  suburbia like that.  No problem of, no threats of being robbed except by a computer making noises.  Well, speaking of which, on the instant feedback, inbred pest from a website you can't mention.  She should make a sound prompt that says, what are you doing?  So Ann can say, I don't know.  Can you help me?  If I were her, now I'd really do it. 
[00:40:00]  Her next sound prompt should be, every time someone walks in, she'd be like, all right,  you checked the other room.  For 20 minutes, you're running downstairs with your gun cocked.  Just wearing underpants.  My underpants.  No, I had to put, like, and here's what happened.  I knew the sound came from outside the bedroom.  So I could see from my bedroom, I could see down my hallway and to the staircase, the top  of the staircase.  So if anyone's coming in, I know they have to be downstairs.  And if they're going to threaten me at that point, they have to come up the stairs. 
[00:40:30]  So I'm putting my pajama bottoms on with a deadlock stare at the top of the stairway.  Like, because I don't want to take my eyes off of it just in case, you know, they rush  me, but I don't want to be caught without my pants on.  You don't want to be found in a nude.  I don't want to be killed or kill someone without my pants on because that's embarrassing  either way.  Because then you can't kill someone and put your pants on because then it's like, you 
[00:41:00]  know, I don't know.  So perhaps there was some splatter on your leg and they would be doing something where  you're screwing around with evidence or things.  So I don't, but I don't want to shoot someone naked or in my underwear.  All right, let's go to Greg in Westchester.  Greg.  Am I making sense, Jimmy?  You're looking at me like I'm a psychopath.  No, you're not.  It's perfectly normal to have them put your pants on before you murder somebody.  It's not murder.  It's self-defense, my friend.  I want your band to be distracting.  Self-defense.  Greg, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Good morning, boys. 
[00:41:30]  Great show.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  You searching through the house looking for that rastly wabbit?  No, I wasn't hunting for a cartoon wabbit, you idiot.  Ah, what's up, Doc?  There's some great phone calls coming in, but we're having a problem with the phones today,  unfortunately.  Why can't I just protect my castle?  It's a man protecting his castle.  That's what it is.  You guys, you're a bunch of faggots.  You're going to sit.  You know what's going to happen someday? 
[00:42:00]  Jimmy's going to order out or something or order one of these whores and he's going to  get the thing and the whore will go, hi, it's a whore.  And the door will open and five guys are going to come barging in and she's going to, they're  going to sit there.  And as you're duct taped down, you're going to see them slip her a couple of bucks for  getting them in the door and then you will be raped, uh, uh, raped again.  Um, that'll happen all night.  And then I'm going to be like mad because I'm like, oh, there's no way they're not going 
[00:42:30]  to charge me extra for this.  The, uh, the Dominican gang attacking you fantasy.  There's no way that comes cheap.  Straighten out the white boy fantasy.  By the way.  You can just open my door.  Hi, whore.  Oh my goodness.  Five men.  What do you do?  Look out your peephole?  I have, I have security in my building.  You think, and they tell me who's coming up.  Oh, so, okay.  That's good.  That's good.  Uh, uh, base your whole livelihood in your life on some doorman, the guys that you hate 
[00:43:00]  in every building you're in.  No, there's a lot of dumb doorman, uh, doorman in, uh, Manhattan, but you just got the real  thing.  All out security.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  Cameras.  Yeah.  All sorts of building.  This building, I'm walking, I'm late today because I'm 604, the phone rings.  I just, I just didn't set the alarm or I did and I put it back to sleep.  Uh, and I'm running in panic stricken because I'm late.  And the door guy downstairs stops me.  I got, I clicked my beep.  Did you shoot him?  Oh yeah.  I, I've done the beep too. 
[00:43:30]  And he goes, no, not good enough.  No, I, no, I, enough with building security in Manhattan.  I wasn't a security issue.  Al-Kind is not taking out this building.  Oh no.  This false sense of, this false sense of security that has to be in every, every building in  Manhattan.  Dude, it wasn't, it wasn't a security issue.  And to give power to these asses that would be working at McDonald's if 9-11 didn't happen.  What he did wasn't a security issue.  I clicked through.  Okay.  He didn't question my belonging here.  He goes, well, I got to talk to you.  And I'm like, what?  I'm late. 
[00:44:00]  Um, and he goes, uh, and he clicked to me here and I'm like, look, dude, I am late.  I got to be on the show.  And he pointed to this pack of, this big pile of newspapers on the desk and he goes, you  going to K-Rock?  I'm like, what?  Yes.  He's not even called that anymore, idiot.  I know, but that's where I knew what he meant.  Yeah.  And he goes, uh, these papers, you got to get somebody to come get these papers.  I'm like, I don't care.  I'm on a show.  I'm late.  And he goes, well, you got to get somebody down.  Papers get the papers.  I'm talking.  I'm Morgan Freeman.  I'm late.  I'm supposed to be on the radio.  I'm talking.  Instead of spitting on him, saying, take me to Piggly Wiggly, you. 
[00:44:30]  I don't know how to make a beep sound.  By the way, uh, instant feedback coming in from the mobile phones.  That does work.  Cause someone actually sent an instant feedback going, Hey, does this work?  Cause I'm sending from my mobile device.  Yes, it does work.  Uh, this one comes from seven, eight, one, but it says, uh, Anthony, you won't shoot to  kill.  You'll burst into tears.  You Sally.  No, in the old days, I may have a little call back from yesterday's crying segment. 
[00:45:00]  We're too honest on this program.  That's the problem.  Protect your castle.  Huh?  And how many wives have you beheaded?  I don't be head wives.  Chip in Saratoga.  Anthony, you're watching too many effing Abbott and Costello meet the monsters movies.  Oh, like no, like there's never been home invasions in Nassau County, uh, New York.  My friend.  There are.  There's been plenty of home invasions.  Anthony refers to his house as a castle, but it seems more like his bunker.  Brian from Florida. 
[00:45:30]  House, bunker, whatever you want to call it.  When that lad came up and said, hi, you're Anthony.  You had those visions of popping out of the bunker and seeing the young Germans defending  the turf.  You know what I did?  I walked up to him, I patted him on the cheek, and I said, I wish I had a whole battalion  like you.  Looks like you needed Danny over at your castle last night to hold your hand.  To hold my hand.  That was damn funny.  If Danny comes into my neighborhood, he's getting shot.  No, he's not.  He's part you.  Yeah, but the other, but yeah, okay. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, he might fit.  All right.  And it's very funny if someone's just trying to flip me through the radio and they hear  that, no, he's part you.  Ah, ah, part you.  What are you going to do?  You're going to do.  You're going to do it.  All right.  In this day and age, I'm asking you to help me here, Hendry.  Why don't we take a break?  Oh, I saw that yesterday.  What?  The Blue Angels.  Oh, can you talk about it after the break?  Because that's a great story.  Yeah.  The Blue Angels are in New York.  Instead of rushing through it, because we're a little late.  But yeah, people had problems with the Blue Angels. 
[00:46:30]  We'll talk about that.  And also, on the way, right after the break, we did the walkover.  Every day, we end this show around 8.50 East Coast time.  And then we broadcast from the lobby of this building all the way over to XM to continue  the show.  And the walkover is broadcast exclusively on XM.  Yesterday, once again, Rich Voss did his on-the-street comedy tour at Pick-A-Bagel.  We got his set.  What a set he's got, man.  We got to replay this today after the break.  It was very, very funny.  And also, on the way, some clips from Homeless Radio that we just started. 
[00:47:00]  And I think it has major potential.  No, it didn't look like a scene out of American History X when I had my shirt off.  I don't have any tattoos.  Put the computer monitor on the curb and steps on it.  You're an ass.  An armed ass.  Bob Kelly is here.  Jeffrey Ross is stopping by today.  It's a very busy show.  On a day we should have taken off, ladies and gentlemen, but we didn't. 
[00:47:30]  By the way, it's Drew Boogie's birthday.  He's mixing for us today.  Birthday, sweetie.  How old, Drew?  34.  34?  Drew looks like he's 21.  Yeah.  I thought you're...  I would guess 28 tops.  Still get proofed?  Yeah.  But you know what they say, black don't crack.  So congratulations on that there, Drew.  That's why I like Drew, though, because he looks young.  Who is they?  Jesus.  You've never heard black don't crack?  Yeah, Sean Rouse had the finest joke ever about black don't crack. 
[00:48:00]  Really?  Yeah.  I can't do it because it's not my joke.  Ah, not your joke.  So way to tell the whole country.  Funny joke coming.  Nah, no, it's not.  Why did I mention it?  But I didn't get that from Sean Rouse.  No, I didn't.  I've been hearing black don't crack my entire life.  Black don't crack is a real expression.  Yeah, okay.  I don't want people to think I'm lifting Sean Rouse's lines because that guy is beyond hilarious.  All right, Drew Boogie, get us out of here for a little bit.  Some sounds from the Opie and Anthony show.  Listen to this.  Can you hear me now?

The phone lines are going berserk.  The phone lines are going berserk.  The phone lines are going berserk.  The phone lines are going berserk.  The phone lines are going berserk.  The phone lines are going berserk.  Oh, my God. 
[00:50:00]  Come on, give it up for Drew Boogie, man.  That is really cool.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Can't make a mix out of anything.  The ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:50:30]  The birthday boy.  Shooting Tony Soprano.  Yeah, that's all right, man.  A couple of instant feedbacks coming in for Anthony.  And did you distribute cyanide tablets to your girlfriend in case they got past you?  Well, you know, you don't want the pain, so bite down.  And also someone wants to know why you don't have night vision goggles yet.  I do.  Of course you do.  I have a night vision, actually a monocle.  It's a single telescope type thing. 
[00:51:00]  Of course it's a monocle.  And it doesn't need batteries.  You press a button on top a couple of times and it's good for about three minutes of viewing time.  And then you just press a couple more times, another three minutes.  That way you can see in the dark.  Yeah, and you can check out the girl in the well in the basement.  Stop your path.  No reason to have that.  You've never wanted to see in total darkness?  No.  Why?  For what?  The lights are off.  I said, I didn't give you a reason.  I just, is there any circumstance you could think where perhaps you would like to see in complete darkness? 
[00:51:30]  When I was five, I wanted to.  I want to fly too.  I'm still like, I'm a stupid kid.  We should let Bob Kelly in on this.  We're convinced Anthony's slowly but surely going crazy.  There's just these little weird signs that pop up from time to time.  What, owning Nogs?  I just, it's cool to see that night vision.  You can also get, a video camera has them too.  I get the night shot on there but these are, I mean this is much better than a night shot. 
[00:52:00]  And I bought it initially because I was going on a cruise.  And I had a great balcony on the edge of the boat.  And people have sex on their balconies.  So, it was great to be able to watch them on their balconies.  Are you trying to prove your case?  Look, I'm just being honest here.  How did you get, you went on a cruise with Nogs? 
[00:52:30]  With military sunglasses?  With a monocle.  Just a peek through a monocle.  Pre-9-11.  We'll let you on with anything.  Torpedoes.  To watch other couples having sex?  Who did you go on a cruise with?  You by yourself?  No, no, no.  I just figured that was one thing.  They wanted to make sure there were no subs in the area.  Another thing was, not subs.  Just looking out at the vast water in front of them.  Those Americans can be sneaky.  Right, you man.  What a radar machine.  You know, the Bismarck went down, my friend. 
[00:53:00]  After he heard the Achille Laurel story, he was going,  Klinghofer, is there going to be a Klinghofer on this boat?  I did take it.  He's out on his deck just looking for subs.  To look out onto the darkness of the water and see what that looks like at night and  what's out there, you know.  You've got to stop playing the video.  And once again.  As I turned it toward the boat, I realized then there were people that were, you know,  out on their balconies and you could see them and they couldn't see you and it was kind  of cool.  And once again.  What if they had nugs?  And once again, his girlfriend has to say, what are you doing?  What are you doing? 
[00:53:30]  She laughs.  What are you doing?  She thinks it's hysterical.  You've got to stop playing video games.  I'm looking for submarines.  I got what?  You've got to stop playing.  Oh, you think it's coming from the video games?  You know what's happening is you're playing like, you know, Metal Gear Solid.  Yeah, that's it.  Trying to be Snake.  I'm shimmying up between buildings and dropping down on people from cables.  Yeah, you've got a samurai sword.  I love those video games.  So calm.  Great stuff.  Sub.  He's building a sub.  I'm looking for a sub.  He's pretty much.  Captain. 
[00:54:00]  Captain.  Hi, this is Anthony Cumia.  I'm in suite 3423.  I believe I saw a U-boat off the starboard bow.  Anthony, could you stop calling the bridge every five minutes with the U-boat sighting?  Nude, laying in his own sweat, yelling, Das Boot.  Das Boot.  Did you see Das Boot?  They can do a lot of damage.  And his girlfriend is going, yeah, I know, honey.  I know.  I know, honey.  I know.  Captain, I'm sorry.  It's my boyfriend.  Could you just give us room service and send the fruit platter down because I'm hungry 
[00:54:30]  and he's crazy?  You have to tell him if you close your eyes, the boats can't see you.  You know, I never tell you what to do, Anthony, but when you do that impression that you just  did, you might want to do it as a female to your boat.  Oh, I figured.  I'll put on my girl voice.  That's what I mean.  Hi.  Okay, Captain.  We're sorry.  He's an idiot.  It sounded a little weird the other way.  Oh, it's just my boyfriend.  My boyfriend and we ordered a fruit platter.  Hi, this is me, Danny. 
[00:55:00]  Anthony took me on the cruise.  All right.  It doesn't have to go back in.  I'm holding hands right now, but he's scaring me.  The gay high five?  Oh, that's the easy part.  I heard that.  That was the easy part, man.  Holding his hand through Shea Stadium was the tough one.  Oh, Jesus.  No, no tripwires are going to my house, but I am getting cameras so I can look into the  backyard from the bedroom.  You're getting cameras in your house?  Well, you've got to put them in the backyard and in the front door.  He's pretty much building a panic room.  Can I tell you something?  I'm really, I mean, I'm kind of mad at you, Anthony. 
[00:55:30]  What's the matter, Bobby?  You're freaking MySpace.  Yeah.  Okay?  I looked at it for probably around an hour and a half.  You had dumb edited photo.  You have video with you sneaking up on you.  It's very creepy.  Dude, it's not even very creepy.  It's actually creepy.  It's one of the coolest videos I've ever seen.  It is the most requested thing I get, like how I did it and everything.  Explain it, because this is a part of the show that doesn't know what we're talking about.  Go to myspace.com, of course, slash Anthony Cumia. 
[00:56:00]  C-U-M-I-A.  C-U-M-I-A.  It's all one word, Anthony Cumia.  And then you'll get MySpace.  And I have pictures of me on there holding various firearms and whatnot.  I got me with my AR-15, my shotgun, and just various things, me at the range.  And then there's a video I did that I put together on my Mac with Adobe After Effects.  It's kind of a video editing program where I was sitting looking at my computer screen through my PalTalk camera. 
[00:56:30]  And then I come out from behind a corner of the house and come up to myself behind me and peek over my own shoulder and look at what's on the monitor.  And it's very, like, creepy looking.  It's very grainy.  It's the creepiest thing I've ever seen.  It's the ring-looking kind of texture to it and everything.  But you can't see that it's him.  You see it's him sitting there, and he's smiling away, and his head's bobbing, and his eyes are blinking. 
[00:57:00]  And then all of a sudden you see this figure in the back sneaking up.  And then it gets right behind him.  And you can see his arm.  And then he, like, leans over and, like, looks at the screen.  It is creepy.  And they're both blinking away.  It's like that glare of the computer screen in a dark room.  I had to actually write something out, and now I just copy and paste it.  Because every day I get about 20 or 30 people that ask me what I use to do it and how I put it together.  Because people kind of like doing things like that as a hobby. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  It's a hobby.  I like doing graphics and stuff.  We're just listening to you.  It's okay.  I love getting on my Mac.  And I do a lot of things with Adobe After Effects and Photoshop and stuff.  It's a lot of fun.  You have a bunch of, like, bookshelves with notebooks filled with neatly handwritten scripture for what you're going to do to people.  Jesus.  I'm hoping to install a green screen down in my basement.  To be honest, that's more me.  I got tons of books in there. 
[00:58:00]  And they are filled.  We're crazy in different ways.  We certainly are.  Opie's a little more covertly crazy.  A little more overtly crazy, yeah.  Put you two guys together, it makes a full serial killer.  Totally, yeah.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  We got all the parts here for a serial killer.  It's just in three different bodies.  You need, like, an O&A ring that when you touch it together, we combine into serial killer man.  You have the guy who, Opie's the actual smart, intelligent, creepy, angry.  You're the guy who actually does the murders, and Norton's actually the sexual deviant. 
[00:58:30]  Wow.  Pulls the underpants off them when they're laying there.  Rips a lock of hair off the fucking, the back of the head.  You're cursed.  Did I?  You gotta watch that FN.  Yeah, see how easy and natural it is?  I bet first dump of the day, Robert Kelly, at 721, it'll say F word.  There you go.  He said the F word.  Well, my ears are not garbage cans. 
[00:59:00]  I apologize.  My young son is sitting next to me on the microphone.  We got a great story that we gotta get to here.  The Foot Licker, have you guys heard about this one yet?  Yeah, on a subway, right?  No, at a Walmart.  Oh, yeah, we heard this in the office.  You gotta hear the eyewitness.  The club star to Kenny and the stupid foot fetish.  Huh, does he have a foot fetish?  He has a foot fetish?  He likes feet.  Oh, freep.  Club star to Kenny likes feet?  Yeah.  I don't know if it's a fetish that's sexual, but he just told me, like, no, I like feet. 
[00:59:30]  With that 70s porno mustache, after kissing feet, their toenails must be perfectly, like,  buffed.  Like they've been on a buffing wheel.  Alright, here's the story from this morning.  A bizarre crime afoot in a Walmart parking lot, a woman in Oklahoma was loading her groceries  into her car when she felt something licking her feet.  At first she thought it was a dog, but when she looked down, she saw a man on the ground.  I looked at him, and I said, what in the hell are you doing? 
[01:00:00]  And that's exactly what I said.  I said, what are you doing?  We still don't know what he was doing.  Woman says the guy ran off.  She called police.  Why didn't she kick him in the face?  Like, first of all, this guy's got some set.  He's under the car, I guess.  Right.  Just waiting.  He probably watches for a woman that he finds attractive with the right shoes, sees her  car pull up.  This is how I do it, anyway.  Gets under the car and waits for her to come out. 
[01:00:30]  When she comes...  Put the glasses on.  Yeah.  She's got to put my night vision on if it's dark.  And then when she comes up to put the groceries in her car, she's got to step right up to  the car, and he just takes a lick of her toes.  That is a sick fetish, man.  You remember my ex-girlfriend, Erin?  Erin, she one time was coming to see me at the comedy cellar, and she hopped into a  cab, and the Haitian cab driver, like, she, you know, she's a sexy, maniac kind of crazy  vibe to her.  She's crazier than a crap house rat. 
[01:01:00]  But she had on, she had, like, nice shoes on one time, and the guy said that if he could  take his finger and rub it between her toe webbing and smell his finger, he'd give her  the free cab ride.  And I'm like, did you?  And she's like, yeah, why not?  Who cares?  Free cab ride.  Dirty cabbie is rubbing his finger against, in between her toe webbing and smelling his  finger on the way down.  Oh, my God.  Awful is that?  I would dump my girl.  Was that?  I would dump my girl if she did that.  Oh, I didn't care.  That is...  Why?  She's economical.  Economical.  He didn't lick her.  She's cutting corners. 
[01:01:30]  Absolutely.  Saving.  That's coupons.  Coupon clipping.  It's dirty black fingers.  Nick from, uh...  Actually, sorry, Nick.  It's someone from their mobile device.  ONA Psycho Powers Activate!  Yes.  Meanwhile, back at the studio...  See, we don't need Frank Kelly anymore.  We can do those voices.  Serial killer man.  We need Norton in my gut.  Let's say hi to Rory in Brooklyn.  Rory! 
[01:02:00]  Hi.  See, they told me it was going to work, and I said, I know it's not going to work, but  I listened to him.  Rory!  I said, okay, I will try.  But I know it wasn't going to work.  Maybe it was Rory's fault, though.  No, because I have to do this.  Now watch.  Hi.  Hi, Rory.  How are you?  I'm great.  How are you?  I want to know what's going to happen to that...  And we still have the same problem.  Hold on, Rory.  You're screwing the phones up, Rory.  Talk right.  What's up, Rory?  I want to know what's going to happen to that ex-Kentucky Derby winner that broke his  leg.  Are they going to stud him out and, you know, make use of his ding-dong or what? 
[01:02:30]  This could be you're not killing yourself.  You're not dying, Sonny.  You're killing everyone around you.  Killing everyone around you.  What?  You go there, a bunch of crazy people.  Things on their heads.  Rory, is this your real voice and everything?  It's me.  It's me.  It's really me.  Well, were you...  Did you really...  Let me ask you a question.  Did you know Sonny was going to rob the bank?  Because a lot of people think that you got the phone call that day and went down just  because you knew he was going to rob the bank.  No, I was unaware, naturally. 
[01:03:00]  I plead the fifth.  All right.  Well, the phones still suck.  Thanks.  And this could have been fun.  All right, Rory.  Take care.  All right.  Take care.  Take care.  Bye, doll face.  Okay, then.  Are you smoking Parliaments or Misty's?  Slim and sassy.  Misty.  Nothing worse than when I used to smoke and I had a bummer butt and it was like...  A Misty.  A Misty.  Like, you live over...  I used to...  I had no place to live, so I lived over friends' houses and stuff like that.  And we were always just ripping off cigarettes from mothers of whatever house I was staying 
[01:03:30]  at.  And they always had, like, Virginia Slims and Misty's.  Benson and Hedges.  Just like, can I have a Marlboro, for God's sake?  I'm smoking a Misty.  It's a toothpick.  You'll like this little, thin...  It was slim and sassy.  You can't even smoke.  The way they don't hand it to you, you have to actually open another man's zipper and  take it out.  That's how the pack comes.  It's a fly.  Like a Motley Crue album cover in 1980. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, uh, uh, uh, Blue Angels.  We were supposed to talk about that before, uh, getting into other things.  Yep.  It's a fleet week.  Fleet week.  Bunch of the, uh, ships coming in.  Guys, keep your women indoors.  Yeah.  Bunch of sailors roaming around town looking for sex.  Looking to have a good time in New York City.  But, uh, the Blue Angels did a flyover yesterday.  How can you say the Blue Angels stink? 
[01:04:30]  I'll tell you why, because I was here for September 11th, and when you're in the morning  and all of a sudden you hear planes like 10 feet over your building, you get a little  nervous.  Yeah.  You look, you see there are boys, you salute them and go, Godspeed.  No, you look and you see a formation of, uh, military jets and you crap your pants.  See, you're one of these people I was just going to address because I saw, uh, driving,  uh, driving, uh, back to, uh, the garage, uh, and I saw, uh, the Blue Angels between, you 
[01:05:00]  know, the buildings.  Yeah.  So, um, they go by, like, incredibly fast, of course.  How do they go by?  How does it go?  Um, boom.  You play way too many video games.  He really does.  He's now living a video game.  Maverick, stay above the hard deck.  Punch out, Maverick, punch out.  You're in a flat spin.  Poor Goose cracks his head.  Stupid Goose.  How great was that?  I love doing Goose cracked his head on the canopy. 
[01:05:30]  Stupid head.  And then stupid, what's her name, crying.  Where the hell played Goose's wife?  Meg, Mel, Meg Ryan.  Meg Ryan.  Meg Ryan.  Meg Ryan.  I was going to say Mel Gibson.  Talk about.  The Blue Angels, by the way, spelled B-L-E-W.  Oh, please.  That is the gayest movie.  You watch.  When it first came out, I saw it, uh, in the theater with a bunch of my friends.  We were just sitting there going, right from the opening carrier sequence.  You guys were high-fiving?  High-fiving each other.  Holding each other's hands.  Holding each other's hands down the aisle to get to our seats. 
[01:06:00]  Because we couldn't see in the dark.  Figured we'd help each other out.  It was such a cool movie when you saw it.  I'm not talking about holding hands.  A bunch of men fishing into each other's pockets for goobers.  And then, uh, you watch it years later and go, is this a bunch of just homoerotic drivel?  They're all in their, uh, in the locker room with towels on.  I'll tell you who's the best.  I'm the best. 
[01:06:30]  Ugh.  Val Kilmer snaps his teeth.  Right.  Snaps his teeth at Maverick.  Ah.  You're unsafe.  Am I?  You should wear rubber.  Am I?  Should I?  That's exactly what he meant.  You should wear condoms.  Am I unsafe?  Am I unsafe?  Take a look at this.  Doesn't even have to.  He's wearing a towel.  Just undo the towel.  And just let it drop.  Wow, Maverick.  You are flying above the hard deck.  You may be a better flyer than me, but take a look at my hog.  Take a look at this.  You could be my wingman any time. 
[01:07:00]  Take a look at this Sidewinder missile, pally.  That douchey 80s dialogue.  Oh, it was horrid.  Maverick.  Maverick and goose.  So, yeah, enough.  The Blue Angels in town.  And they got the police.  911 was being tied up.  They're getting all kinds of calls from people going,  There's planes over New York. 
[01:07:30]  If you had any inkling of what's going on in the city,  you would realize that it's Fleet Week.  They're doing air shows.  There are military aircraft around.  And it's military aircraft.  It's fleet.  You said fleet.  Fleet.  People think boats.  If I saw a huge aircraft carrier coming in,  I wouldn't be disturbed.  They're the Fleet Week.  There are things called naval aviators.  Yeah, but who does that at 8 in the morning?  Do it at 12 in the afternoon.  It was in the afternoon.  That's when I saw it.  It was wonderful. 
[01:08:00]  By the way, I've got to cut in.  Scaredy cat.  The instant feedback is rocking today.  Liddy rules.  All right.  It took you years to figure out Top Gun was gay,  even with that volleyball scene.  Look, all right.  Even when I first saw it,  that volleyball scene is probably the gayest thing.  All right.  That's hardcore gay porno.  What was that?  I don't remember that.  Oh, when they had the volleyball game,  it all took their shirts off and posed.  They're doing these muscle man poses.  They're posing for each other.  I'll tell you what made it gay.  This is what made it gay.  Not that they had their shirts off. 
[01:08:30]  It's that they weren't in shorts.  They were in jeans.  Yeah.  They had their jeans with no tops.  It was like a gay neck club.  And it was filmed with a high-speed camera,  so it's in slow motion.  Home motion.  Home motion.  The gayest part of any movie,  even gay porno.  Home motion.  Home motion.  They filmed it in.  Yeah.  Set me up for the spike.  Like, okay, lay down. 
[01:09:00]  And then another one.  Flying standby writes,  did Opie turn to Danny at the Mets game and say,  you're dangerous, and snap his teeth?  Snap his teeth.  When he snaps his teeth, you're like,  what the hell is that?  That was the weirdest thing ever.  What is he snapping at?  Hey, let's go to Stu in New Hampshire.  No teeth in the locker room?  I want to snap my teeth at people.  Hey, oh, the phones are working now.  Good.  Stu.  I want to call Opie out for his dumb line a minute ago.  Yeah, which one?  He said to Maverick, 
[01:09:30]  I'm a better flyer than you are.  Does she mean pilot?  What's a flyer?  Well, come on.  That's a little picky.  Technically, he was a flyer.  Something you stick underneath a windshield wiper in a parking lot?  Absolutely.  We have nothing written down.  We're just improvising all morning long.  We're winging it, man.  Yeah, we're just kind of doing it on the pilot.  We're all trying not to say the F word.  Right.  How hard it is.  How hard.  A curse while you're talking about Top Gun.  Going into this gay topic you want to see. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, of course you do.  I'm looking at Norton's face, his bottom lip just quivering.  You think the volleyball scene, by the way, was Tom Cruise's idea?  I don't know.  If I recall, I don't believe Tom Cruise was topless in that one.  He was.  He took his top off.  Goose was the only one that wasn't.  Oh, okay.  Right.  Yeah, he didn't want to.  What was the problem with Goose?  Well, Goose was.  What's his name from ER?  What was the problem?  Anthony Edwards.  Three nipples?  I'm thinking way out of shape.  Looked at the other hot gentleman and said, I'm keeping the wife beater on at least. 
[01:10:30]  But thank you to a homo fan for remembering that Goose had.  It was Goose that didn't have his shirt off.  I'm going to say Han had his shirt off.  I'm going to say birthmark the size of a baseball with lots of hair, like just off the side.  Oh, you think that's it?  A big hairy one they couldn't cover with makeup?  Right.  A big German shepherd mole underneath his armpit.  He couldn't actually go for the ball. 
[01:11:00]  German shepherd mole.  Everybody kept throwing up in their mouths at the test screenings.  Can we put a pink tank top on him, please?  Put your shirt back on.  Miguel.  What's up, Miguel?  Yeah.  What about in that volleyball scene when Tom Cruise goes to check his watch, check the time?  He does like a little muscle flex there.  It was every move they made, no matter how innocent.  He's absolutely right.  Tom Cruise goes to just check his watch because he's late with his date with Kelly McGillis. 
[01:11:30]  So he checks his watch.  It's in slow motion.  And it's like he flexes his bicep, turns around.  He like has to turn at the waist.  And his other arm is kind of doing this curl.  And he's looking at his watch.  I remember it like it was yesterday.  Yeah, like yesterday on the couch with your glasses on naked.  My night vision.  What year was that, like 88? 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, somewhere around there.  Maybe even before.  I don't know.  Hey, Jason from Ohio.  How about the scene right before Goose dies when they're singing Great Balls of Fire?  Yeah.  Oh, that was great.  That was when everyone realized Tom Cruise could not sing.  Or the other one where he's like...  You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips.  And then you're starting to criticize little things I do. 
[01:12:30]  Shut up.  That movie was really awful.  It really was.  Popcorn stinks.  I'm saying that like it's risky.  Yeah.  You're really out on a limb there.  I'm a rebel.  I was like, thanks for adding to the topic at hand, Jimmy.  Wow.  Raging Bull sucked.  Now that's making a statement.  That's true.  Very profound.  I know.  All of a sudden I come in and just kill it.  I hate the gun.  That movie stunk.  You know, Biodome really didn't hit the mark.  Right.  I take no prisoners when I do radio. 
[01:13:00]  You're edgy.  You're just...  That's right.  I'm on the edge, man.  I take no prisoners.  Hey, who's this?  Guy on phone.  Don't have name.  What's your name?  Go.  Hey, Chris.  What's up, man?  Let's go, Chris.  Right when Iceman turns to Maverick and chomps his teeth and says,  you're unclipped, and I don't like that.  No.  I think that was in the outtake reel.  The gag reel for the Christmas party.  Why is everyone bringing it back to me at the Mets game?  Because you were holding hands with Danny. 
[01:13:30]  And here's the beauty of it.  You didn't know it was Danny, so you had no shame.  There was no irony in it.  You were walking naturally, just holding his hand.  And they're probably like, that's Opie.  I'll have to explain to Bob Kelly now in a second.  Did Danny try to catch a foul ball without a glove,  and you bit at him and said, you're dangerous?  How did you not know?  Well, Josie writes, did Opie go to Danny?  You can ride my tail any time.  You share a little story on the show, and you can't move on. 
[01:14:00]  Of course not.  Justin from Rockford, Illinois.  They will not stop.  Hey, Opie, were there any monster rain delays at the Mets game yesterday?  And it goes over here.  Let's go to Kevin in Virginia Beach.  We're not even talking about what happened at the Mets game anymore.  We're talking.  Opie.  Yes.  Did you break your knee at the Mets game?  Hold my hand, man.  Hold my hand, Danny.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand, Dan.  Jesus.  Well, now I've got to tell Bob Kelly before the break.  I actually heard it.  Oh, you did.  I heard you actually slipped the move in, 
[01:14:30]  but how did you not know that your beautiful girl's soft hands  didn't all of a sudden felt like the bottom of a slipper?  Grab Danny's hand.  You have no problem doing stuff like that.  I have no problem.  Danny, come here.  Come here, Danny.  Let Bob Kelly hold your hand.  Again.  Tell me if I should have noticed.  Again, still.  If I should have noticed.  He's like Super Mario.  It's going to be like a bricklayer.  Put the coffee down.  If we're going to do this, we're going to do this right now.  But the mind plays tricks on you.  When you turn around and grab your girlfriend's hand, 
[01:15:00]  you're assuming you still have your girlfriend's hand in your hand.  Dude, I feel like I'm holding rolled up quarters.  His hands are like fat.  Oh, great.  Yes, Bob.  Couldn't help me out one time.  Doesn't Lindsay have thin fingers that are, you know, like ladylike?  Your mind plays tricks.  When you turn around and go.  Your mind plays tricks.  When you turn around and you grab your girlfriend's hand,  you see yourself grabbing her hand.  Now you turn forward.  She's behind you.  You're kind of dragging her along.  Then you reach behind and grab her other hand. 
[01:15:30]  You're assuming you have her hand.  You would have a defense if you didn't know Danny was with you.  If all of a sudden he showed up and grabbed your hand.  And I'm really into it because we had a really nice day together.  So I'm walking up the aisle in front of everybody because the seats were so far down.  And then I walk all the way up the row assuming because all of a sudden Lindsay let go.  And I'm assuming I'm still holding on to one of her hands.  Can I just say something?  Were you putting your energy into the...  That's what I asked.  A little squeeze or a thumb rub. 
[01:16:00]  Were you putting love energy, like that orange light of energy, into like trying to...  Oh, can you feel that?  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Because when you hold hands with your girl, sometimes you rub with your thumb or you play  with her pinky or something like that.  You're saying that I had such a great time.  And sometimes when that happens with your girl, you try to make her feel that.  Yeah, yeah.  The energy you touch with her.  A little squeeze.  We'll do dumb things to each other all the time.  But when you know it's happening, you're like, ah, whatever.  I'll just deal with it, right?  But this, I really believed I had Lindsay's hand. 
[01:16:30]  And I'm walking.  You know, well, once again, I grabbed her hand.  I turned around.  And now I'm dragging, she's behind me because we're going up a very narrow aisle at Shea  Stadium from way down near the field all the way up.  So everyone can see you walking up the aisle.  And then I reached back to grab her other hand because now we're like single file, basically.  So I'm holding both her hands, really getting into it.  She has a great sense of humor.  So she sees what's going on.  Sold you right out.  Well, no, because I never grabbed her second hand is what happened. 
[01:17:00]  I definitely had one of her hands.  And when I reached back to grab her other hand, she's got a good sense of humor.  Danny grabs my other hand.  And she goes with it, realizes what's happening, and lets go.  So now I'm assuming I got Danny.  I got Lindsay.  Ah, it comes out.  When I hold her eyes.  I'm assuming I got Lindsay's hand as I walk all the way up the aisle and then across to  get to the exit.  And yes, I'm really feeling like I was.  The whole way, just holding a man's hand in front of Shea Stadium.  It wasn't like I had a Broadway show or something. 
[01:17:30]  Without an ounce of shame or discomfort about it.  Because I had no idea.  I had no idea.  Someone, wow, someone was there at Shea, saw it, and actually heard you say,  take me to bed or lose me forever.  Take my breath away.  Take my T-cells away.  Take my dignity away.  Hold my hand. 
[01:18:00]  I'm gay.  All right.  It's only fair.  I did this to Anthony yesterday.  I'll do it to myself today.  Bag it.  Yeah.  Because there's probably a part of you, like when you were walking up, just feeling good  that probably said, God, it's never felt this right.  Because you're unsafe, Johnny Cakes.  No idea, man.  I was like laughing really hard and mortified at the same time when I finally turned.  So that was just Danny.  That was damn funny.  I'm like, please don't tell me I've been holding your hand pretty much the whole time. 
[01:18:30]  He goes, yeah, you have.  I'm like, oh.  Danny, you know we're going to have to take you to a hotel room and beat you with a pool cue.  Right.  Halfway through the fifth inning, you knew it felt kind of odd, but then you didn't even  look until the bottom of the seventh.  You looked at Danny.  It's a joke.  He's just got, you know what it is.  You got to have some kind of hair.  Do you have any hair on your hands?  Dude, you're not thinking.  No, dude.  He does.  And I'll tell you why his fingers, because I hold my, you know.  There's no hair on his knuckles.  Dude, his fingers feel like little circumcised penises, the little fat construction worker 
[01:19:00]  hands.  But you're not thinking, because you turned and you saw yourself grab, you know, your girlfriend's  hand.  Right.  Yeah, those are hands just made for, like, framing out a house.  Hold this hand.  I'm not even falling into this.  Go ahead.  Just hold this.  I'm not touching his hand.  You just rubbed it.  Hold it.  I rubbed it.  It wasn't his hand.  Okay.  He's all limp.  You do have some pudgy fingers there.  He does.  He has pudgy fingers.  He could open up any can with those hands. 
[01:19:30]  He was hoping to with the game.  All right.  Listen.  It's becoming a rough morning for me here.  Why don't we...  We have to take a break.  We are so late.  It's not even funny.  We got Drew Boogie in studio rocking and rolling for us, doing some mixing with some of the  sounds of the O&A show.  And it's his birthday.  So take us out for a little bit, Drew.  And we'll be back in a while.  So...  Are you rainin'?  So...  So...  Are you raining? 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, sure.  Are you raining?  So...  Are you freezing?  Down.  So...  Are you raining?  So...  Are you freezing?  So...  Ladies and gentlemen, it's the Opie and Anthony Show, radio to the power of rock. 
[01:20:30]  Sounds exciting.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202.  I'm Ian Anthony.  Smack my pizza. 
[01:21:00]  Ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow.  All right, huh? 
[01:21:30]  That dumb fat ass falling off that grape-squishing barrel.  Love that clip.  Drew Boogie in-house today, doing a great job on his birthday.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show, the ONA virus spreading across America.  Bob Kelly in studio.  I have to wish you a happy birthday to my friend, JGNYC, from a message board we're not allowed to mention the name of, from .NET, 
[01:22:00]  but he is a huge fan of the show and a supporter, so happy birthday, dog.  Happy birthday to you.  And Bob Kelly's part of Torgasm.  That's going to be on HBO.  I got all nine episodes.  I can't wait to check it out this weekend.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got an advanced copy.  It's the Dane Cook Project, Torgasm.  Bob Kelly's going to be a star of this thing on HBO.  I've just been all night, like, burning off copies and sending them to my friends.  Absolutely, man.  I mean, I think we talked about, we rent a little theater, we charge some money. 
[01:22:30]  People watch all nine episodes.  You charge a little money.  Then you cancel the HBO subscription.  Yeah, you don't even need it.  They're eating it up, man.  They're eating it up.  Wait a minute.  Guys.  Hey.  Hey, wait a second.  All the boys are blowing up at the same time, though.  It's very cool to see.  Very cool.  How funny is it?  I actually said this to Colin the other day.  I was like, it's unbelievable.  Jimmy has a show the same night.  I have a show on HBO.  I go, you're writing a show for HBO.  Oh, forget.  That didn't work out.  Oh.  He showed up.  Does Colin need that abuse?  He hung up the phone. 
[01:23:00]  It was four in the morning.  Hung up the phone.  Four.  He showed up in my apartment with a hammer with a pick on the end of it.  I have a photo of it on my MySpace.  I swear to God.  He came to my house to smash me in the head with a hammer.  I'm not even kidding.  There's a photo on my MySpace with him holding a hammer.  I was laughing and crying at the same time.  That's what he actually carries around to eat, that fatso.  So he just clubs something and then opens it with the pick end.  Some kind of indigenous animal.  He looks like a fat Kiefer Sutherland. 
[01:23:30]  I've never heard a man that has more descriptions for him.  With other celebrities, only fat.  He has a show called 224 that's coming out.  Fat bastard.  He looks like the Queen of England every...  Oh, forget it.  Nice talking to you.  Here it comes.  Do you have it over here?  I don't know.  I was going to see how you were going to eat that banana. 
[01:24:00]  Exactly.  Let's go to Nick in Pennsylvania.  Nick, it's pretty hard to eat a banana in this studio.  I like the way Bob realized how far it was going down his throat and then pretended he gagged.  Is it bad that I spit on the end of the banana before I eat it?  Hey, Nick, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey, what's up?  Are you guys going to play that clip of Voss?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Come on, let's do that.  Oh, yeah, let's do that right now.  We do what the listeners say.  You know, I didn't think we needed Tom Chiasano around or Mark Chernoff. 
[01:24:30]  We're running our own ship today.  We're like an hour late as far as playing commercials.  They usually pop their faces in the glass booth there and kind of give you the sign.  Hey, the panic sign.  Let's take a break.  They're not here.  The hotline hasn't rung.  Why aren't you breaking?  Well, now that they hired us to save everyone's ass, to save everyone's asses, it's great to know that they think they're in good hands and they can take a Friday off.  That's the same thing I thought yesterday.  I thought, all right, everything's going well. 
[01:25:00]  We really love the staff here.  Everything's working well.  They're supporting the show.  But a mere month into this, they're leaving us completely unsupervised.  And that has never worked for us.  I know that everyone in radio realizes that they hired us here at CBS Radio.  We're on, what, seven or eight commercial radio stations.  They hired us to save their asses.  Everyone knows it in radio.  They'll tell you.  The industry knows.  They'll tell you.  Yeah.  And I think they're taking advantage of us. 
[01:25:30]  I don't like it.  I don't like it either.  I think they're taking a risk that they're not here.  That's crazy.  That's crazy, people.  So they all took Friday off.  I'm glad you could take a Friday off.  We felt like we shouldn't take Friday off because we're too new into this.  We've been here a month.  Too dedicated to this thing that we took on.  Yeah, let's think about it.  We've been here a month.  Tom's been here 20 years.  I think he can take a day off.  But if we weren't hired, was he really going to make 21?  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:26:00]  Why would you leave this festering disease?  Was he really going to make 21 years, Anthony?  Jeez.  I don't know what this station would have become.  I could give you a whole list of people that are going to be able to celebrate another  anniversary at CBS Radio.  You know who Tom looks like?  You remember in American Beauty, the Marine who tried to kiss Kevin Spacey at the end?  That's who he reminds me of.  Oh, my God.  I think he has a very distinguished Tom Brokaw look to him.  He's a handsome face.  He's a very sharp dresser.  Yeah.  Dresses to the nines. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  This is the boss?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Snazzy dresser.  The guy dresses to the nines, man.  Nice suit all the time.  Fits in perfect.  Yeah.  The right tie with it.  Like, I'm an idiot.  The only time I wear a suit, it's a funeral or someone's wedding.  Period.  And they're awful.  They hang off me wrong.  Like, everyone gets a nice fitted suit.  I'm like the rack guy.  That's good.  Give me the Bugs Bunny tie.  People laugh at that.  You always got to be on.  I can't just be a well-dressed person. 
[01:27:00]  I suck.  How about the piano keys tie?  I wear that because it looks kind of jazzy.  And then do you play it a little?  Like, eh, it's a little joke.  Yeah.  You know, like I'm in the Star Wars Cantina.  That again.  I like the bolo tie.  I go with that look.  Oh, western.  A southwestern thing.  I like a little horse with a diamond necklace.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It actually moves around.  A lot of turquoise and silver.  Yeah.  Guys, let's play the Rich Vosley.  You wear that east of the Mississippi.  You should be shot.  Let's play the Rich Vos thing from yesterday.  Please.  It was great.  He went to pick a bagel yesterday. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, we should explain because a lot of new listeners catching on every day here.  We do two shows, basically.  We do the first half of the Opie and Anthony show from Free FM here in New York City.  But it's one show.  It's like a Twix bar.  It really is one show.  You can crack it in half and have two, but it's still one candy bar.  We do do one show technically a day, but we have to split it into halves because we  still don't know why, but we have to go to two different studios every day.  So when the first half of the show ends around 8.50, we go into the lobby of this building  here in New York City. 
[01:28:00]  Grab Danny's hand and make a walk.  No.  We regroup, and then we're exclusively on XM, and we broadcast the walk from here to XM  every morning.  And some days, we get some fun radio out of it.  Other days, it's a bore fest.  We understand that.  Other days, it's just a walk.  It's just a walk that we broadcast.  Yesterday, once again, we had Rich Voss doing comedy.  And the first two times, he did it at Starbucks's.  But we ran out of Starbucks's.  Starbucks's.  Starbucks's.  He did it at Starbucks's. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, it's my foot thing on the foot.  Right, exactly.  Starbucks's.  It's hard to pluralize with an S at the end.  You think you're going to be caught in a loop forever.  Starbucks.  Can I get cinnamon?  We went to a couple of Starbucks.  Ah, there you go.  His first one, Starbuckeye.  Yeah, we went to a.  His first one didn't go over too well.  You don't think?  No, the first one didn't go over too well.  The second one, he killed at the Starbucks's.  And then yesterday, at Pick a Bagel, huge crowd. 
[01:29:00]  His jokes went over pretty good.  And his crowd work, brilliant.  Yeah.  So he did a good job.  So here it is.  Rich Voss doing comedy at Pick a Bagel.  Pick a Bagel is.  Yes, today morning.  Listen to this.  He's got balls to do this, though.  Just walk into an establishment like it's a comedy club.  It just starts going.  We got Kenny's intro?  I think so, yes.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  And welcome to Pick a Bagel.  Coming to the stage right now. 
[01:29:30]  Your first movie.  People are shocked, by the way.  You're really going to love him.  They think it's a robbery.  You've seen him on last comic standing.  Give a warm welcome to Mr. Rich Voss.  Thank you.  Thank you.  A big hair for Kenny, huh?  Look, I'm working out some new stuff.  I got a big audition today.  So I need everybody's attention.  I'm a little...  Don't go anywhere, sir.  I know you don't work.  I'm a little depressed, folks.  We just put my grandfather in a rest home.  Well, not actually.  We didn't have the money.  So we drove down the turnpike and put him in a rest area. 
[01:30:00]  Thank you.  Actually, he just passed away.  He died of a heart attack.  He would have made it, but he was dyslexic, and he dialed 119.  119.  Oh, come on.  These are good.  Hey, Mom.  Turn your head, Mom.  Look at these hotties right here.  I got some stool softeners in my car.  I love a lady in a walker.  She's already bent over.  Anyhow, do the teeth come out?  What's your name?  Holy shit.  Fred?  Oh, Greg.  Are you married?  What was Lincoln like as the president? 
[01:30:30]  He's cute.  Look at this guy.  He's doing a threesome with these two.  Oh, my God.  His hair is white.  Anyhow, I just got back into town.  I landed yesterday.  I'm at the airport.  I hear over the loudspeaker.  If you see anything suspicious or unusual, contact the authorities.  And right then, I saw a black guy leaving a tip.  Loosen up.  Loosen up, folks.  This is all I got.  You having a good time?  Usually, you're hiding behind a tree.  Anyhow, she's a little aging girl. 
[01:31:00]  Look at her.  Hey, how you doing?  Look at this.  Smell his finger for gunpowder.  We know you.  You probably tunneled here.  Anyhow, he's working the crowd.  Is this a good set?  Folks, bagels on me.  You guys are a good crowd.  That's not a bad set.  Very good.  Boom.  Good night.  I'm going back to Starbucks.  This place sucks.  Close the show, Kenny.  Close the show, Kenny. 
[01:31:30]  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  Let's hear it.  Give him a hand.  Rich Foss, people.  Give him a hand.  There you have it.  Rich Foss on the streets of New York yesterday.  It was actually one of his TV sets.  Really?  Maybe it wasn't as good as I remembered.  Yeah, you were painting it like it was this moment of improv.  Thank God, caught on audio.  From national TV to pick-a-baggle.  Not even video, audio.  I know.  It was that awful.  A hell of a step down. 
[01:32:00]  Last comic falling.  All right, listen.  We've got to catch up.  People can kill us, but we have to.  We have to.  But at least we're here working today.  We could have taken today off.  Yeah, we could have.  So bear with us, please.  I wanted to take off today.  Yeah, obviously.  No, no.  No, I never oversleep.  I had.  I was.  Yeah, obviously.  That's right.  Half day, Jim.  Half day today.  You know, when a friend is down, you don't kick him.  You help pick him up.  Yeah, whatever.  O&A virus spreading across America.  Drew Boogie.  Hit it. 
[01:32:30]  Bye.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Thank you. 
[01:33:00]  Thank you. 
[01:33:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred. 
[01:34:00]  I invented everything.  I invented everything.  Come on, he's the real deal.  Drew Boogie helping us out today.  Scratching live with some of the sounds of the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Happy birthday, Drew Boogie.  Holy crap.  Bob Kelly in studio.  Jim Norton is playing the Stress Factory all weekend long.  Only show left. 
[01:34:30]  We added this show Sunday night.  The 10.30 show.  Hour, 10 o'clock, whatever it is.  There's probably about 60 tickets left.  7, 3, 2, 5, 4, 5.  It gets sticky.  Ha, ha.  So if you want to come down.  And our awful Nathaniel will be making an appearance.  All right, very, very, very, very, very, very, very good.  Give Jeffrey Ross something for his fingers.  What's the matter, sweetie?  What's the touch?  He needs moist.  He needs something moist.  Wait, did you reach under the...  Yeah, he reached under the console.  Under the desk like he used to do in school?  It's completely stickied up his hands. 
[01:35:00]  What do you got?  Artie Lang's sperm in this place?  What's going on here?  Do I have a spooge on this and leave it here?  There are some leftovers that we don't know what it is that you just grabbed onto.  Yeah, they probably don't.  Thank God that you got your shots from Iraq.  You know what it is?  I apologize, dude.  I was coughing into my hand for a few days and I would just kind of hold it up and wipe  it under the console.  It's just Jimmy Flamin.  He's a healthy boy, so it should be all right.  Oh, of course he is.  But I think they might have dumped out.  Jeffrey Ross, you know, joining the program, he reached under the console and it's all sticky 
[01:35:30]  and gross.  Yeah, it's very funny.  And then your comments about what it was probably got dumped out, unfortunately, because it was very  funny.  Because this now...  I'm used to being on satellite.  I know.  I know, you guys.  Thank you for sending me that radio.  That was a huge gift.  I listen to it every day.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I'm a long overdue thanks to you guys.  I work out with that radio.  I love listening to you guys.  It's showing.  You finally got it.  Yeah, you look thinner.  Oh, thanks. 
[01:36:00]  But then again, you're doing the up and down stripes that make you look thinner, too.  I'm on the view.  I'm on the backhanded compliment there, I'll be.  He carries mirrors with him.  I'm the first person in the show business to do your show and the view in the same day.  Oh.  You're doing the view later on?  Yeah.  Wow.  Look at that.  I'm surprised because you always said you thought that, like, Star Wars are fat dykes  and they let you on.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, I never said she was a dyke.  I'm kidding.  I meant fat like P-H-A-T.  This is fun looking at Jim to the back of my head.  This is really.  Yeah.  This set up stinks.  Well, it was set up for the Grand King to be in the middle. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, it was set up.  And all of his subjects, it didn't matter where they were.  It was set up for Howard and his massive ego.  Yeah.  God forbid anyone else gets attention in this studio.  Jeffrey Ross was telling me, and I'm not blowing up your spot, trust me, because I asked  him, and Jeffrey goes, well, when I used to do Howard's show, I had to sit way back over  there.  I'm like, behind Howard?  Would he at least look at you?  He goes, yeah, he would turn that way, but it was always strange and awkward.  You could never make eye contact, like, for timing, you know? 
[01:37:00]  You had to wait until someone stopped talking and then talk.  And then you start talking, like, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.  No, no, but that's how it is, though, right?  Like, you try to talk, and then someone else talks, you're like, okay, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  But the moment's lost.  You're going to put your hand up and, like.  You know, we're in the honeymoon stage with CBS, but eventually, you know, we might as  will say it now.  You're going to have to rebuild the whole studio here for us.  Uh-oh.  Well, because it's still built like, you know, how it was when Howard was here and  his dumb ego.  Our studio over at XM is flat. 
[01:37:30]  Like, we have a flat granite top with mics sticking out of it.  It's a round table.  You don't know who's in charge.  We like it that way.  It's a round table.  You look around.  It's like, is Anthony in charge?  Is Opie in charge?  Is Jimmy?  You don't know, because it's a round table.  Don't be polite.  No one says it's Jimmy in charge.  No, I was just trying to include you.  Is Jimmy in charge?  Yeah, actually, it's pretty obvious Jimmy's not in charge.  He has no equipment in front of him.  Anthony and I have like four or five panels of screens and keyboards.  He has a yogurt lid in front of him.  That's all I have is a yogurt lig, like Bob would say.  Yogurt lig. 
[01:38:00]  A yogurt lig is fine, and I want to get the sound machine that they promised me.  No, you're not getting a sound machine.  I want one.  We have all that in front of us.  You're right.  It's pretty bare in front of Jimmy every day at XM.  That's why the console's sticky.  No.  All right, here's the deal.  Jeffrey Ross, four stars in the New York Post today.  Wow.  Out of ten.  For what?  It's actually a four out of four stars, which you never see.  For what?  His stand-up?  For a roast, perhaps? 
[01:38:30]  No.  No.  No.  No.  For a film, basically.  For a film.  And I got a beef with you.  You thanked us for the XM radio, right?  Yeah.  I don't thank you for the advanced copy that you promised me.  Oh, well, I don't have them yet.  They're not on DVD yet.  But in a couple weeks, it will.  No, you had it when it was playing at the film festival.  Oh, really?  And you were supposed to send one my way.  I was really into checking this thing out.  I gave you a good excuse, and you call him right back out on it.  He re-raised you.  Yeah.  I don't forget.  That's why. 
[01:39:00]  I was really looking forward to a copy of this.  I'm sorry about that.  I'll make it up.  And now I'm seeing in the post today four stars for this thing.  It's not on DVD yet.  No.  But you had a copy or something, because you were going to give me one.  I walk around like an open mic-er handing out DVDs to my stuff.  Yes.  Where's Rich?  Those days are Rosses in here today.  I hire Voss to do that for me.  Well, of course, we're talking about Patriot Act, a Jeffrey Ross home movie.  It's going to be on Showtime Sunday at 8 p.m.  Yeah.  I set my DVR ready.  I can't wait.  Thank you, Ben.  I really appreciate it.  You know, and I've talked about my experiences on these USO tours on your show a few times, 
[01:39:30]  so I really got to thank you guys for letting me do that.  All this hard work is starting to pay off.  It's amazing stuff.  It's you going over there to entertain the troops, and then there's little things there  like you almost dying.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  My hotel was mortared.  Your hotel was mortared.  At least that's what I told them when I checked out.  Well, I saw a little clip for it on Showtime, and they showed you in one of the hospitals 
[01:40:00]  with an IV just looking like crap.  I put the trailer up on my MySpace, and every time I look at it, I feel that way again.  Yeah.  It's so hot there.  You know, Jim knows.  It's like 125 degrees, and you're trying to not be anxious and nervous and sweating,  and sometimes it just gets to you.  It's really tough over there.  You've got to give it up to the boys.  And you wonder how those guys, you know, they're humping a lot of equipment and stuff.  What were you, you know, you were probably wearing just...  They were whacking off cloud formations.  You know what it is? 
[01:40:30]  While a lot of guys are here enjoying the freedoms that we provide for them, we're over there  taking care of business.  That's right.  Taking care of business.  I was over there, too, guys.  I forgot.  Oh, here it is.  He was entertaining the insurgents, so you can't go by him.  Hey, how about those roadside bombs, people?  He looks like Alzar Cowie's third bodyguard, so he had no problems getting in and out.  He knows he's safe because no knife could get through that neck.  He's like, three of them have to lift his head. 
[01:41:00]  Meanwhile, I'd be finished with a pocket knife.  You really would.  My little spaghetti neck.  They would actually use a Popsicle stick to take your head off.  They'd take a nail clipper.  The infidel is dead.  They would just twist your head like you do with a fingernail when it's coming off.  You have to twist it, and then it just pulls off itself.  Wow.  You've got to do that the right way.  Yeah.  You get a thin red stripe all the way up to your elbow.  Pull it.  Ow.  You just unravel like a mummy.  I want to read some of this review for Jeffrey Ross today. 
[01:41:30]  New York Post, four stars.  And the New York Times has given it a good review, too, right?  Yes, sir.  That's great.  I've never heard of these papers.  What?  The best documentary to emerge so far from the Iraq War comes from an unexpected source.  It is comedian Jeffrey Ross, a sad sack with a high-pitched voice, and a face like Walter  Matthau's.  What?  Wow.  They can't just give you a compliment.  I just, you guys who showed it to me when I came in, I didn't even, oh, my God.  They describe you as a sad sack. 
[01:42:00]  Sad sack?  With a high-pitched voice and a face like Walter Matthau.  Imagine what a bad review would sound like.  I know.  Don't get it, man.  Well, the Post just thinks.  They call us now Dopey and Pervy Pal.  Yeah, Pervy Pal.  They don't even try rhyming anymore.  You sad sack.  Jeffrey Ross, a bag of prostate cancer.  But he put together a good film.  God knows how he did it, being a blithering idiot.  This lumpy douche.  He's been around for years, and it's perhaps best known for his participation in the Friars 
[01:42:30]  Roast, and now he deserves to be best known for something else, his personal videotaped  account of a trip he made to Iraq to entertain American troops.  The film he made, titled Patriot Act, a Jeffrey Ross home movie, and running just an hour  and a quarter, hour and 15 minutes?  Hour and 17 minutes.  Hour and 17 minutes reveals that Ross is an observant, as observant a journalist as he  is a comedian, something he might not even realize.  Nice.  Did you realize that?  Not until I came back.  Did you realize you're a sad sack? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, I knew.  I actually went over there.  What do you feel like when you showed him the movie?  You know, I obviously went over there to do a job, to do stand-up shows, but while I  was there, I was sort of shooting home movie, and just sort of as a tourist almost,  and it wasn't until I was halfway through the trip that I realized I was seeing stuff  that it would be hard to explain to people, and I just kept shooting, and over time, the  footage and my emotions took form, and it became a movie.  The funniest movie ever to come out of Iraq.  Is there a lot of comedy in it?  Yeah.  It's very funny. 
[01:43:30]  Because I wasn't sure if you were serious right there.  No, no.  I mean, Iraq funny.  Even with the, you know, because it's a pretty tragic place right about now.  Oh, I'm like, do you find Iraqi bellhops at the Al-Rashid right after it gets mortared?  Did you try to press him to see if Colin, what's his name, Colin Powell is a good tipper  and stuff like that?  Did you shoot it yourself, or did somebody shoot it for you?  I brought a $600 camera like we all have the night before I left, and I just shot it.  You shot it.  I'm behind the camera through the whole movie talking.  This review is really unbelievable.  So he ran a camcorder throughout the entire trip and later created this documentary, which 
[01:44:00]  is as touching as it is hilarious.  Wow.  That's really good.  I can't believe it.  I'm getting goosebumps.  Sounds like M.A.S.H.  Sounds like you did something like M.A.S.H.  If it came, it's mush.  Well, the interesting thing is the creator of M.A.S.H., Larry Gelbart, the night before  I left, I went by his house.  Sued you?  Alan, I'm spitting in your face.  I asked him for advice, and I showed him the secret itinerary that I had only gotten  that night.  And in the movie, whenever the chips are down, like when I go to the medic's office or when  the hotel gets mortared, Larry Gelbart pops in with some words of wisdom. 
[01:44:30]  He's very funny.  Oh, really?  Very, very prolific guy, yeah.  And are you narrating through this, or is it a lot of audio as you're shooting, or  do you later, you're like-  Both.  Both?  Yeah.  That's a pretty good idea.  You're going to love it, man.  I know.  Believe me, I love-  I saw you with your guns.  You're going to love this thing.  Any of the documentaries coming out of there, I'm hooked on.  A lot of people-  I'm watching them.  A lot of people asking if it's going to be on DVD eventually.  July 11th.  Oh, very cool.  Just two more things from the review.  It's a long review, but two more points here. 
[01:45:00]  It's hilarity stems from Ross's running commentary throughout the film and the performances of  the comedians before appreciative crowds of servicemen and women at bases and camps all  over Iraq, some of them on the frontier and within range of enemy mortars.  And then finally, it says, the touching part is what Ross learned.  I'm starting to get why Bob Hope did this for so long, because these were the best crowds  I ever performed for, Ross says as the film's conclusion.  Every single GI that I met yanked me-  Oh, yanked me.  Jesus.  Every single GI that I met thanked me for coming. 
[01:45:30]  Easy there, Freudian slip.  Every single GI that I met thanked me for coming, but I should have been thanking them,  because if anyone got a morale boost, it was me.  Nice.  Yeah, the guy's obviously very appreciative of the people that are going over there and  hesitating.  It changed me, Anthony.  It changed me.  I was so cynical.  These guys, you guys know.  It changed me.  I'm a lot less cynical.  I'm more patriotic.  Probably a better person for it.  Really?  They just want to shake your hand.  They thank you for coming.  They just think this is great, man. 
[01:46:00]  They're so happy you should have.  Did it change your view on the war itself?  Because I know a lot of people have an opinion of the soldiers and the job they're doing,  and a lot of times that's very positive.  There are a few idiots out there that don't realize that these guys are over there doing  a job, regardless of the circumstance or who sent them over there or why.  But did it change your opinion on what we're doing over there?  It enlightened me to an opinion, which I never had before.  An opinion.  I was always aloof, and I never cared.  I always confused the military with the government. 
[01:46:30]  I didn't even realize there were two different things as a kid.  And only in retrospect, and seeing how the war's played out, and meeting the soldiers,  and seeing the sacrifices they make, I realize that you don't necessarily have to love...  When I was a kid, I loved the Yankees.  I hated George Steinbrenner.  You don't have to love the owner of the team to root for the team.  Yeah, true.  And I never understood that before, and I really have a lot of love for the troops.  There's a lot of...  It's very mixed, diverse, as you guys know.  It's a lot of women in the movie, and I had no idea. 
[01:47:00]  If you'd switched all our clothes around and put uniforms on, we would look just like the  people in the movie.  Yeah.  Regular Americans.  And I always thought it was like, you know, the Marines you saw in Fahrenheit 9-11, like  crazy, revved up like jocks.  It's not like that.  The regular army looks like regular people.  Yeah, any documentary I've watched, you usually really...  You watch these guys, and you go, God, where's, you know, where's the Rambo guy, or this one?  And they're just guys going, hey, I'm just trying to live through another day, and, you  know, make it home, and...  I met a 21-year-old girl, Shannon Holm, the first woman ever to win a Purple Heart paratrooper. 
[01:47:30]  And she complained it didn't come with matching earrings.  But for real.  But for real.  There's a lot of tough broads over there.  You got to give them big props.  Big props.  I heard that.  Are you going to say that on The View?  A lot of tough broads over there.  Yeah, tough broads, like right in here.  Joy Behar will put her fist through my face.  Why don't you point a star and go, you know, it's funny.  Even over there, surprisingly, the blacks pulled that way, too. 
[01:48:00]  I was listening to Ron and Fez the other day, and they were talking about that Baghdad ER.  Yeah.  Have you seen that?  My movie's Baghdad Ha Ha.  Ha Ha.  See?  A little play on it.  I haven't seen that movie.  It's very disturbing.  It's, you know, an ER in Baghdad.  So they're showing a lot of butchery that goes on over there until they can stabilize people  and fly them out, and Ronnie brought up a great point of how this seems to be the ignored war. 
[01:48:30]  It's a war that is going on.  People are aware of it.  They see, like, things in the paper about it, but for the most part, people are over there.  They're getting killed.  They're getting wounded.  You know, what now?  18,000 people have been wounded over there, maybe 19, well over 2,000 dead,  and it just doesn't seem to sink in with the people because the second it's brought up  in conversation, it instantly turns into a political argument. 
[01:49:00]  So people are so sick of it, of going like, you know, hey, you know, how about these guys  are over there fighting and they're doing the, oh, what are you, one of those liberal,  this guy, or, oh, you Bush supporter, this guy, you can't discuss the war without having  to get into this liberal, conservative argument about politics.  It's not a war, though.  That's the one.  They said the war is over.  So there's no war.  There's actually supposedly.  There's a war.  I know there is. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  But there's no war.  That's why, you know.  But it's ignored, and people are coming home to, you know, occasionally, I go down the  expressway, I go home, I'll see a sheet hung up with welcome home sergeant, you know.  Yeah, that's all they get.  Smith.  And that's what they get.  Some sheet hanging over a highway somewhere.  There is no recognition that these guys are getting when they come home for fighting this,  you know, whatever.  Because it's been going on for years.  Right.  It's not on the front page anymore.  It's on page six, then page seven, then page eight.  Now, going into Memorial Day, people, it's just like a little blip on the media radar behind 
[01:50:00]  American Idol.  It amazed me.  I think one of the reasons for that, this is speculating, in World War, and again, I think  this happened with Vietnam, too, is when people don't see what you're doing as defending the  country.  Right.  And I'm very pro-true.  I'm just saying this could be a reason why people look at it that way.  Like in World War II, attacked.  And I think when people don't view it as a direct defense of the country, they either  become resentful or indifferent to it.  But this has been completely just ignored, which is just the oddest thing, that they're 
[01:50:30]  human beings.  These guys and women are over there just dying.  And, you know, they do nothing.  One of the things, I know you have to take a break.  One of the points, we can make it after the break, but these USO trips aren't about politics  or about people.  And that's one of the things I make clear in the movie.  I don't take a side.  You know, the one thing I did learn from the soldiers is teamwork.  And the sooner, like you're saying, the sooner that people can stop arguing about why we  went to war, the quicker we'll start coming together on ways to make history. 
[01:51:00]  That doesn't mean how you finish it, I'm not being political.  I'm just saying, if people keep arguing, nothing's going to happen.  Colin got me so good when we were over there.  There was a bunch of like these warthog pilots, these A-10 pilots or whatever it's  called.  And Colin's got like, he's talking about like freedom of speech.  And he goes, you know, you guys are out there fighting.  Because like, you know, Jim here, he's really against the war.  He doesn't believe what you guys are doing.  You're fighting.  He did the same thing to me.  He did the same thing to me.  We walked into a Marine base with around 20 Marines.  And he walked in.  He goes, listen, you know what? 
[01:51:30]  He doesn't believe in what you're doing or the war.  But he's here to do comedy anyway.  And then he walked out.  You got me even better.  I'll tell you after.  Yeah, please.  Let's tease that.  Jeffrey Ross in studio.  We're all going to be watching Sunday at 8 p.m. on Showtime.  It's called, once again, Jeffrey.  Patriot Act.  Patriot Act.  Very, very good.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Here's more Drew Boogie.  Just about ready for a bitch.  Just about ready for a bitch. 
[01:52:00]  Just about ready for a bitch.  Just about ready for a bitch.  Just about ready for a bitch. 
[01:52:30]  Stay tuned for more Radio Awesome.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  All right.  Looking forward to it.  Oh, not at all.  D.C.  Keep putting your lighters up.  Philadelphia. 
[01:53:00]  Put your lighters up.  Detroit.  Put your lighters up.  Keep putting them lighters up.  No matter where you're from.  Put your lighters up.  If you don't like  what you see here  what you see here  Get the funk out.  If you don't like  what you see here  what you see here  get the funk out. 
[01:53:30]  Get the funk out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Other  wacky  cooky stuff.  Yeah.  Other  wacky  cooky stuff.  Very nice.  Drew Boogie in studio  scratching some of the sounds  from the Opie and Anthony program.  The ONA virus  spreading across America.  We got Jeffrey Ross in studio.  Hi. 
[01:54:00]  That was some audio from our first broadcast together, Opie.  That we still haven't played for everybody.  We haven't played because it is such a douche chill, embarrassing tape.  What was that noise?  What was that sound to it?  Wacky, kooky stuff.  Ew.  Yeah, other wacky, kooky stuff, Opie.  I was doing an impression of a hack jock.  The first time Anthony and I worked together, I got the tape,  and one day we're going to play the entire show.  We've gotten through maybe two minutes of it. 
[01:54:30]  Maybe two minutes.  And we both had to bail out.  It is so embarrassing.  It's so uncomfortable.  We're both so happy to be there.  Opie's the consummate professional.  He's been in radio for years.  I was the newbie, just happy to be there.  And I'm so eager to please that I'm over the top.  And in order to even calm my nerves enough to be in that studio,  I had to pound beers before I got in there.  So I was like all kind of wasted and drinking a lot of coffee.  Hey, Opie, what do you think? 
[01:55:00]  And Opie didn't like mention anything in the news.  Hey, you know, you hear about the plane that flew over the White House?  The plane flew over the White House.  What are we going to do about this guy?  Just throwing out too many impressions, too fast, too eager.  I got plenty of douche chill moments myself.  One day we're going to play it, but we got to get the right guys in.  I mean, Jeffrey Ross would be perfect.  All the guys in studio today would be perfect, actually.  And Patrice O'Neal and Colin Quinn.  I don't need the abuse. 
[01:55:30]  And we'll just sit back and let these guys just beat the crap out of us.  Is your voice a little higher than it is now?  Oh, yeah.  A little higher.  Hey, it's Opie with the nighttime attitude.  I was 14.  I mean, give me a break.  Sounds like Mariah Carey.  Yeah, that's pretty good, actually, Jimmy.  I like that.  You know what?  She hits the highest notes in music.  Yes.  Very good.  Jeffrey Ross in studio.  We're doing another thing.  We're doing another plug here.  It's hard to believe.  Is there a lot of wacky, kooky stuff on this?  Shut up, Jimmy.  Wacky, kooky.  I'm catchy. 
[01:56:00]  I'm flashy.  We're the morning guys.  I don't want to hear it.  I've heard about a couple of your jokes early on in your career, my friend.  I was good.  No, there was one about a gorilla.  What was the one?  Norton?  A monkey.  What's the joke?  Come on, tell me.  Tell us.  Is this the Ben and Jerry's ice cream one?  Yes, yes.  The Ben and Jerry's ice cream joke.  I thought it was really funny to make fun of rich people, so I said something like I  was in Connecticut because that was the rich area.  Yeah.  And I had ice cream, but they don't call it Chunky Monkey. 
[01:56:30]  They call it Obese Primate.  Oh, God.  No, that's good.  That's six months ago.  That's funny.  You rub your head.  It's on your HBO special.  By the way, if you enjoy that joke, Jimmy will be at the Stress Factory all weekend  long.  That's right, but don't tell anyone.  That's my opener.  I'm open with that.  You're closing with that.  Who are you kidding?  If you enjoy that joke, Jimmy will be at the Stress Factory for the rest of his life.  Right.  I'll start yelling, Obese Primate.  I'll have to do the voice. 
[01:57:00]  I don't know.  Right after the phone call.  Coogie wacky stuff.  But Jeffrey Ross has another show to promote.  Jesus, Jeffrey.  He's on Showtime this Sunday at 8 p.m., and he's also doing something for MTV.  What's that about?  MTV.  I don't even know the name of the show.  Sorry.  MTV wanted to let your listeners know first.  It comes on June 10th.  It's really cool.  This is my first time talking about it on the radio.  It's called Where Are My Dogs At?  Me and Tracy Morgan play animated.  It's a cartoon.  We play stray dogs wandering around Hollywood making fun of celebrities.  I think this is Bobby and Whitney. 
[01:57:30]  Okay.  This clip.  Oh, we got a clip?  All right.  It's Tracy Morgan and me as dogs.  Bobby, you.  I can't.  You need to get out of my face.  That's Whitney.  You nasty.  Oh, stinking.  Ah, damn.  No, you nasty.  Check my belly.  Oh, man.  Fat.  Check it.  Hey, woman.  Look.  What are they saying?  I don't know.  Let me get my English to crack dictionary. 
[01:58:00]  Bobby Jr.  Bobby Christina.  I have to go drop it on the one, so you need to go play now.  Love you.  That's it?  That's it.  What was the, uh?  It's kind of underwhelming on the radio.  You really need, that's the thing about animation.  Thank God he said it.  Is the animating.  Thank God.  Because you know there's something going on that you can't see.  Thank God he said it.  You need color.  We were all looking around, feeling a little uncomfortable, and Jeffrey just... 
[01:58:30]  If cartoons worked on the radio, there'd be Koreans.  Let me see that.  Out of work.  The show's so funny that I could slam it when it's necessary.  No, no, no.  Is this for you to bring this to the other show?  There's a real trailer up on my MySpace page.  Oh, okay.  It's really funny.  Did you throw it across the room?  That's good.  That would be funny.  That was Dean Edwards doing both voices, by the way.  Now, with animation, you've got to see the cartoons.  You've got to see the whole thing.  Dean Edwards, talented, another talented black dude that SNL didn't know how to use.  There's a trailer up at MySpace, Jeffrey Ross live. 
[01:59:00]  Jeffrey Ross?  It's really funny.  It comes on June 10th on MTV.  We'll definitely check it out.  What kind of dog are you?  I play a beagle.  You're a beagle?  What is Tracy?  I play Buddy, a little lost dog from New Jersey.  Tracy plays a big, fat bulldog, street dog, with a gold tooth and a Louis Vuitton collar.  He's hilarious.  Of course.  He's really good at it.  All right, we're going to go to the phones here and say hi to Kevin in Jersey.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, I'd just like to thank Jimmy for going over there and doing his thing for the troops. 
[01:59:30]  You're welcome.  Thanks.  You're welcome.  Oh.  Hey, I was over there for a year and Robin Williams came over there a couple of times and we saw  the WWE wrestlers, but we can't tell you how much we appreciate you doing this.  I appreciate you telling us that, man.  You got to see Robin Williams, huh?  What's that?  You got to see Robin Williams?  And he's hairier than most Iraqis.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, yeah, he was.  It's distracting in movies to look at his arms and his hands, the back of his hands.  There's so much hair there that I don't hear dialogue.  He was believable in Gorillas in the Mist.  Sometimes when I'm sitting there talking to him, I'll just keep looking at his arms.  Oh, yeah.  Remember that?  Oh.  You're his buddy.  I forgot about that.  You have espresso together.  Yeah, I was there, right?  Jimmy's never drank an espresso in his life.  Robin Williams orders an espresso.  I'll have an espresso.  I'll have one too, yeah.  Can I get a photo?  Get one for Jimmy Norton. 
[02:00:30]  No, they just took candid photos of Robin and I talking, so it's not a big deal.  It's one of the few times he set the table.  You know, he would know who you were.  Oh, he would.  That's not true.  He liked you.  Yeah, yeah.  He's very friendly, guys.  That's what upset me so much.  He talked to me one night.  I was walking out of the cellar.  He goes, where are you going?  I go, where are you going?  And he came out and talked to me.  It was the most uncomfortable five minutes of my life.  Not you.  Why was it uncomfortable?  Well, because I don't really, I'm not good around famous people, dude.  I'm like that type of icon. 
[02:01:00]  You're not good around anybody.  I live with you.  You're garbage.  We didn't live together, you loser.  You're in the building.  You're garbage, too.  Yeah, I know that, but I'm not up here acting like it's only celebrities.  But you guys would visit each other's apartments and stuff.  I would pet his dog.  I love Bob's dogs.  He would come to my apartment.  You were like Jerry and Kramer.  He is.  Constantly.  Rolled into one fat body.  Hello, Newman.  Hello, Robert.  There's nothing worse than us having lunch and falling to sleep.  He has both of my dogs on his lap.  I'm on my couch.  Both of us snoring. 
[02:01:30]  We have sleep apnea.  Bags and Diet Cokes everywhere.  His dogs love me.  I love his little animals.  Yeah.  I would go to Bob's apartment.  No, he would actually pick his nose and feed it to my dog.  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah, Diva would lick bookers off my face.  Why would you do that?  Why wouldn't you?  I would look over and my dog would be like getting Scooby snacks from Creepo.  Oh, because they love salty stuff, doggies.  Yeah.  That's disgusting, though.  Because then what would Bob go, come on, give me kisses, give me kisses. 
[02:02:00]  And the dog would lick Bob's face and leave a big green slimy thing on his cheek.  No, it's like a big, clear, viscous-y teardrop.  A salty teardrop.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  You don't feed other people's dogs your snot.  You don't feed anybody your snot.  I would feed your kids my snot.  Not yourself.  If your kids are around me, I'll feed them my boogers.  But I'll eat my own snot.  Isn't that weird?  No.  Amazing.  No.  Never.  Anthony's never eaten his own snot.  I put it on cereal sometimes.  Never, ever, ever. 
[02:02:30]  Don't start picking.  Now, Jimmy's got to annoy me by picking his nose.  I can't even get anything.  There's nothing in there.  Yeah.  Because you've got the roadblock across the top of you with the Breathe Right strip.  Let's keep it everything back.  Listen, we've run out of show.  The first half of the Opian Anthem is pretty much over.  We've gone from political social commentary to eating our own snot.  That's the beauty of the show, though.  Let's be honest.  You don't know where we're going.  A Patriot actor, Jeff.  I'm going to plug Jeff.  Yes, please.  A Patriot actor, a Jeff Ross home movie.  A great documentary about him being over in Iraq. 
[02:03:00]  We'll be on Showtime this Sunday.  What time?  Four-star reviews.  8 p.m.  8 p.m.  You never see four stars, man.  Brave reviews for the film.  And then the MTV thing, Jeffrey.  MTV 2, June 10th.  Part of the new MTV 2 Sycamation block.  And now he has to go.  Well, no.  You're going to do some radio with us at XM?  Yeah.  Then we're going to go to the View.  And then he's going to the View.  Very nice.  Want to hear something funny real quick?  No.  All right.  Never mind.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  So, you know, I'm always on either.  It's either late night or cable or it's so dirty.  So, I'm on the Today Show yesterday. 
[02:03:30]  My hometown, New York, New Jersey.  I tell my whole family to watch, right?  They're all watching.  I go on a Today Show.  I kill.  The phone doesn't ring.  An hour goes by.  Three hours.  I realize it aired everywhere in the world except the Tri-State area because of that stupid power  outage on the train yesterday.  Oh, man.  That's a tough business.  You were robbed.  Are you kidding?  It's a tough business.  Bumped for a train with no power.  They're never going to replay that.  No.  They had to go local here in New York, obviously.  All right.  Well, listen. 
[02:04:00]  We got to go because XM is going to cut us off.  And I want to get a little more Drew Boogie in.  Drew Boogie's birthday.  Thanks for helping us out today, Drew.  Why don't you play us out?  And we'll see you guys on XM in just a few minutes.  Love you guys.  Opie and Anthony, XM202. 
[02:04:30]  There we are. 
[02:05:00]  Are we on the radio?  We're on the radio.  Oh, we're looking on the radio.  We're on the radio.  Are we on the radio?  That's the first.  Thank you, Kenny.  Are we on the radio yet?  I want to be on the radio.  We're on the radio.  Opie is hooking up his microphone.  I had to make sure this mic was sterilized because that degenerate, homeless bum, Tippy 
[02:05:30]  Tom, was using this yesterday.  Wow.  Look at that girl over there.  My mic.  Out of all the fucking microphones that could be used, my mic had to be used yesterday.  What is that?  By the sign you mean?  Yeah, she's lovely.  What the hell's going on there?  Holy shit.  Is she a Hispanic?  It says ONA till what?  Till I'm DOA.  Till I'm DOA. 
[02:06:00]  Is that your girlfriend?  Sorry, we're going to have to take her.  Let her nag you to death.  You can have her.  Are you a nag?  The mic's not on.  Wow.  She's calling her a nag.  Hold on.  I'm Jimmy.  What does she nag about?  That junior high homework?  She's a lovely one.  Well, you look very young.  You know, hanging out with her, walking with her down the street, I feel like I'm going to  end up on a Dateline special.  How old a girl are you, miss? 
[02:06:30]  14.  Oh, wow.  Nice.  I'm 18.  18.  How old are you?  21.  How long have you been dating her?  Like three years?  Good boy.  15.  Nice.  Yeah, it works out very nice.  O and A till I'm DOA.  You should listen to the show.  Oh, of course, all the time.  I make her.  Good.  Where do you two hook up?  Where are you from?  A little place called Luigi's Pizza in Hazlitt, New Jersey.  Oh, you're from Jersey?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Nice. 
[02:07:00]  How old is she?  18?  She's 18.  Yeah.  21?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a good relationship.  It'd be cool if you were 35 and you'd been dating for 10 years.  It'd be awesome.  What's wrong with your mic, Opie?  I don't know.  Is it work?  Hello, hello.  That's better.  I can't hear him.  I can't hear him either, Steve.  Yeah, I can't hear you either.  It smells.  Hello?  Oh, there it is.  It smells nice and clean, so probably they cleaned it with soap and water because Tippi 
[02:07:30]  Tom was using his mic yesterday.  He's shaking it around a little bit.  He probably fucked up the microphone.  Jeffrey Ross helping us out with the walk today, everybody.  This is very exciting.  There's a 12-year-old here, half naked, laughing at me like I have a chance.  She must, what do you do?  A lot of guys hitting on her all the time.  No, never.  Why?  I mean, you get a lot of stares.  I don't know.  I mean, look at me.  I'm like 5'6".  I'm kind of big up top, like 195.  So, I don't know.  Maybe they see that and think I'll go nuts on them. 
[02:08:00]  No, it's because you have the psycho beard.  You have the psycho beard.  He's got that little bit of hair under.  It's like half a goatee, which is the true sign of a psychopath.  You look like Harry Potter on steroids.  Yeah.  Actually, that's the first time I got that.  Yeah.  Never.  I actually take that as a compliment.  Thank you.  You shouldn't.  All right.  Let's start the walk to XM.  Yes, our trek.  We got to make the walk quick because Jeffrey Ross has to be on the view in a little while.  How weird is that?  How weird is that is right.  All in one day. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, it's probably the first, right?  First person ever to do your show and their show at the same time.  I do believe you're right.  I've never actually wanted to be a piece of the sidewalk so I can peek up.  I know Star Jones is leaving.  You like her, Jim?  I heard the fire marshal wouldn't let them both be on the show at the same time.  We got two different conversations going on at the same time.  Do I?  Yeah, you guys talk about Star Jones.  I'll talk about what I would like to do to her for money.  Wait, sir.  Oh, how stupid. 
[02:09:00]  Mind your business, Peter Boyle.  Turned around.  Mind your business.  You dropped something, miss.  He's looking at you.  He's going to fight you.  No, he's not.  God, we're so bad.  I got Club Soda Kenny and Master Poe.  I'll fuck that guy in the mouth.  Mind your business.  He's looking back.  He's going to fight you.  He's fighting nobody, that fucking balding creep.  Looks like he's going to turn you down for a loan.  All right, we get it.  You're taking pictures. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, that's right.  Stop trying to look like you know what you're doing.  He's taking pictures of the girl.  Mustachioed zilch.  Love that guy.  Takes pictures every day.  How many pictures do you need?  It's a cool hairdo.  Yeah.  That's a great hairdo if you're starring in scanners.  I'm a fucking asshole.  The skull blows off.  Here we go now into the masses.  Excuse me, miss.  Are you frightened or happy?  We can't tell.  Sorry.  Oh, my God. 
[02:10:00]  Well, how can you tell, right, Jimmy?  There's just no way.  He's an Asian girl.  Are you frightened or happy?  We can't tell.  Back across the street.  Have you noticed that we have not seen Tony Bennett since we scared him away?  Yeah, that old fuck.  He switched our roots.  I've had enough of him, too.  Won't say hi in the air.  Go fuck yourself.  Enough of Tony Bennett.  Yeah, we know.  You were Sinatra.  We heard that.  Can't fucking stop by and say hi.  All right. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  What are we going to do?  Exactly.  Interview him.  Just a quick hello.  I got to go.  I'm late for my workout.  Are you?  We'll make him hip with the kids.  He really started to bug me.  Grave, she cut a little stinker.  Cut a little stinker.  Don't make like you're squeezing her ass.  Her boyfriend might see.  We're stuck at this light.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Making our way to XM.  Hey, Bobby, what do you think?  This is the first time Bob Kelly has done the walk with us, Bob. 
[02:11:00]  Any thoughts?  Slow down.  Any thoughts in that head?  No, this is fantastic right here.  This is, hey, you're in the crosswalk.  Hey.  No, it's the pedestrians that are screwing him up.  Let the man drive.  I can't believe Mac is actually zoning out with headphones on.  How is Mac still alive?  Don Wickler got him an XM unit.  What is he listening to?  Mac.  Mac, what are you listening to today?  88.  88? 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  What?  He's listening to the news.  Oh.  88.  88.  He thought you said, what's the last year you showered?  88.  B-O.  W-what?  Nothing.  B-G-O.  Beat.  B-G-O.  B-G-O.  Bad B-O.  Oh, it's jazz?  I don't know, but it's beating whatever David Lee Roth got.  Opie, why don't you hold his hand?  He has the same hands as Danny.  Yeah.  He stumbled over that and it was still funny.  All right, Mac. 
[02:12:00]  We have nothing today for you.  Hey, you got new pants.  Where'd you get the new duds?  Ben gave it to me.  Oh, yeah?  What, just came over and said, here's some clothes?  Yeah.  That's pretty nice.  What are you doing with all the money we gave you?  About food.  About some food?  Yeah.  That's good.  I'm sharing Aruba.  This corner work out good for you?  People come by and give you some money?  Yeah.  Oh, good work, Ben.  A buck.  Bob gave a 20.  Jesus.  20 bucks. 
[02:12:30]  20 bucks.  Hey, give him the dollar back.  You don't need that crap.  Ooh.  I'm already over.  My tax guy tells me I'm already over on my charitable contributions.  Bye, Mac.  He does well every day.  The listeners take care of Mac every day.  Mac, don't tell the rest of the guys what's going on.  You want all the money for yourself.  All right.  That fatso.  Holy shit.  Jesus.  Hey, Chief from Cuckoo's Nest.  Oh, did you see this fat-faced idiot? 
[02:13:00]  Oh.  It's Larry David.  Jesus.  Larry David.  It looks like Latka's priest.  What's going on, Jeffrey?  What?  What's wrong?  She's staring at...  Jimmy, she wants to talk to you, I think.  Who does?  The fat lady.  Oh, let me ask her.  We're doing interviews to the street.  Hi.  Two weeks.  Hi, miss.  We're doing interviews.  How are you?  Two weeks.  I speak English.  Why did you carbon freeze Han Solo?  I speak English.  Oh, okay.  Two weeks. 
[02:13:30]  Nothing on the Jabba line?  How does a Jabba line come?  That was funny.  I know.  She does have, like, the Jabba face.  She speaks English.  I know.  That's what makes me say.  No English?  Oh, okay.  So talk.  What?  Who wants to get made fun of?  Espanol?  Ah, sí.  To resemble, resemble, look like, look like, El Jabba, El Hutto.  No. 
[02:14:00]  No.  Please let her slap him.  How come that works in the movies?  Her boyfriend's about to assassinate you.  What's up there, B?  He's taking a picture of you.  Can you hear that, home?  Jeffrey Ross tried with her.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Anyone speak Spanish?  Hold on.  I just got to pick up my weed real quick.  I thought that was my weed dealer for a second.  Pick up his weed.  She looks like me, my before pitcher on Fat Smash Diet. 
[02:14:30]  Oh.  Wow.  Say it again.  No one heard it.  Hey, how you doing?  Nice talking to you.  Let's go.  I think if you turn her ear, her head separates, and Arnold Schwarzenegger is in there.  I like the fact that you reworded it.  I had to reword the same bomb joke, son of a bitch.  I swear she looks like her.  Who's this fucking Ed Beagley zilch?  Right.  What do you want?  It's Fat Opie, as they call him. 
[02:15:00]  Is that who that is?  Yeah.  It's my future brother-in-law.  He feels like Jack and the Beanstalker.  What was that show where people follow you down the street?  What was that thing?  I don't know.  I couldn't think quickly enough.  I'm thinking of a racist joke.  Who's this guy with the freaking sunglasses?  Who would have?  Ben, the producer?  The guy that looks like he's going to kill us.  Smoothies today?  No, who's the guy that looks like he's going to kill us? 
[02:15:30]  Oh, that guy?  Yeah.  Richard Ramirez?  Who is he?  Hey, yeah.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot, pal.  Well, no, you're looking a little crazy.  Don't get mad at me.  Well, that's all right.  I am crazy.  This is my story of my life, too.  It's your goddamn show.  He's here to kill you.  And I say one thing, and he's going to stab me now.  I got this psycho.  Come on.  I'm from Chicago.  Don't chip on my shoulder.  I love New York.  Leave Frankie Valli alone.  Can you blink?  There you go.  Can you see through the glasses?  I did.  It was sideways, you alien.  Hey, man.  I worry about the guys who can't see the eyes. 
[02:16:00]  You know what I'm saying?  You can see my eyes, pal.  Yeah, that's right.  You want to see my eyes?  No, I could care less.  You know what I'm saying?  No homo.  No homo.  Oh.  Jesus, you nutcase.  Where are you from?  Chicago?  Chicago, yeah.  Oh, what's your name?  Randy Rockman.  Randy Rockman?  Randy Rockman.  Good.  That's good, dude.  And what do you do, dude?  XXXadulaction.com.  Do you star or do you produce?  No, no.  Check it out.  XXXadulaction.com. 
[02:16:30]  Check it out.  Okay, cool.  You're a director?  Porn director?  I do my thing.  No, no.  It's my site, man.  It's my site.  We're on XM, right?  Yeah, what's on the site?  Do you fuck for a living?  Porno crap.  What kind?  We know it's porno.  Adult.  All kinds.  We know it's adult porno.  Yeah, we got it.  It's kid porn.  We know you weren't selling Patrice-sized t-shirts.  Real chicks, man.  Real chicks?  Real chicks.  As opposed to what?  Hey, real chicks, you know?  This is the worst plug for a website I've ever heard.  You got to be specific.  What do you have?  Porn.  But it's adults.  We understand that.  Not that we approve of it. 
[02:17:00]  Well, you know, I mean, straight.  Straight.  Oh, so chicks.  Straight adults.  Chicks getting fucked.  And then a lot of other stuff.  By guys.  Yeah, all that.  Yeah, chicks getting fucked by guys.  All right.  You got blacks and blondes?  Yeah, got that too.  Got that too.  Ah, nice.  Nice.  Yeah, real women.  Asian?  Asian.  We got Asian.

Yeah, we got black chicks.  We got black chicks.

Yeah, sure.  Sand monkeys.  Do you have a shwogie on shwogie?  We got all kinds.  All kinds, my friend.  Check it out.  All right.  Check it out.  Buy something.  All right.  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  De Niro should stab him in a vestibule.  Oh.  Oh, good.  Oh, stab him in a vestibule.  I stink.  Why not, sir?  I got to do it again.  That is the creepiest guy to ever go.  Get your hand off my back.  Go on the walk with us.  Come here.  Go on the walk.  The creepiest guy so far?  Let me tell you something.  You know him?  No, but he is with my sister's boyfriend, so I believe he's coming up to the studio.  Oh, good.  Oh, fuck.  That guy's coming up?  That guy with the phone?  Great.  Just let him sit in the chair and watch through the glass.  Yeah.  I think we're losing Jeffrey Ross, right, Jeff? 
[02:18:30]  Oh, wait.  Another few minutes.  Well, you got to go to The View.  You're here?  You got to go to The View.  Yeah.  Is that sissy?  Yeah, that's pretty sissy.  I like The View.  You got to get women appeal, right?  Oh, no, you don't.  You can't just make jokes about women and never embrace and love them, right?  They'll call you out on a few things, though.  Yeah.  Now, I've seen you on some of the roasts, honey, and you ain't too...  You said a couple of things about me.  You've made some Star Jones jokes. 
[02:19:00]  I did once sit under Star Jones on Hollywood Squares after lunch, and she kept farting  on the square above me.  Are you serious or are you kidding?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it was definitely creaking.  Like, I thought the whole thing was going to collapse.  Something over all the years.  Right now, the fire marshal is tightening up the stage for Rosie O'Donnell's arrival on The View.  All right.  We got to get upstairs to start the second half of the Opie and Anthony show.  Any smoothie order before we go up?  I'll have one, sir.  Get me one.  Oh, be nice. 
[02:19:30]  No, thank you, Kenny.  That's how I order my smoothie.  What do we got here?  I yell at Kenny for it.  Jesus.  Hi, sir.  Help the protest.  What are your issues?  What are your protests?  Bad mustaches.  We're walking against AIDS.  Well, good luck to you.  Really?  Any donations?  We're walking with AIDS.  How about a donation?  You can afford that suit.  Oh, we're in trouble.  Yeah, that was Fred Goldman.  Very good, Ben.  Oh, Jesus.  That guy did look like Fred Goldman.  Who's Fred Goldman?  That wasn't Fred Goldman.  We're told time and time again. 
[02:20:00]  Who's Fred Goldman?  It's not him.  No, it looked like him.  I'm Bob Kelly.  So don't say, if I say, who's Fred Goldman, don't act surprised.  Fred Goldman was the guy.  I'm trying to talk to you.  Stop rubbing my belly.  Oh, why's Bob Shai?  I wish he was your dad.  You can't touch me like that.  That was a damn good one, Anthony.  Thank you, Jimmy.  He wishes that Fred Goldman was your dad.  Get off me, Norton.  Stop touching me.  Norton's grabbing everyone today.  He's holding.  He's not grabbing.  He's holding. 
[02:20:30]  Why don't we have a learn?  I have my hand inside of his jacket, and Bob is like, I'm talking like this.  Come on, man.  We're not supposed to be hanging out in front.  What's the news to Van doing there?  I don't know.  It's CBS.  Why don't we do an assault on the media to him?  Oh, maybe because we actually have a woman making them walk, so the media send people  down.  Where's that psycho?  Does anybody get an eye on him?  Maybe we should leave that station alone.  No smoothie.  I was implying that we never have girls.  Yeah, I know.  I hear you.  All right.  Come on.  I'm walking with you.  Let's go.  Everybody in.  Guys, thank you.  Take it easy. 
[02:21:00]  You too.  Have a good weekend.  Take it easy.  Bye.  You're welcome, my friend.  Isn't that beautiful?  Look at that.  What a walk.  Wait, sir.  What was that?  Mind your business.  O.D. Anthony.  XM 202.  Where the fuck am I?  The fuck is it?  Yeah.  Disgusting.  Sexual.  Parents say it is not for kids.  Pornography in the workplace.  We played on TV screens.  Drawings.  They ran south and took off with a family car. 
[02:21:30]  People making nasty comments about women.  Viruses.  Writing in our area, find out where.  Racial language and racist attacks.  Push the button.  Don't be an Anthony.  I'm a black ninja, fuckbait.  All right, we remember.  Shut up.  We smoke pot with Snoop Doggy Dogg on a daily basis.  You're talking out your ass.  This is going to be some action today.  I'm going to crap myself.  Oh, what a log you're going to have.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Yahoo! 
[02:22:00]  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Holy shit.  Yahoo.  And he.  Oh.  With O.B.  I have psychosis.  Anthony.  I'm a xenophobic asshole.  Jim Norton.  I don't have the chops to do this.  And a bunch of zeros.  Good old man.  Steve really is love.  Perfectly enunciating bulb.  Sorry, Steve.  E-Rock.  I bring nothing to the table.  They love when Hawk fucks up.  Shut up.  But more importantly, we see Derek's balls. 
[02:22:30]  You just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Problem, Hawk?  My crotch is burning so bad.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  guitar solo  We'll be right back. 
[02:23:00]  You get in the elevator, and there's a lot of other people in there that have nothing 
[02:23:30]  to do with the program, and it's very quiet, and you just hear, Jimmy blasted such a loud  one.  It was so embarrassing, and I'm laughing hysterical.  I couldn't stop laughing.  Thank God it didn't smell.  It didn't smell.  I was far enough away where I wouldn't have been able to smell. 
[02:24:00]  I'm waiting for one where the elevator's full, he farts, it's one of his real bad ones, and  that will just be atrocious.  Jimmy, you can't conjure up a stinky one for those situations.  No, I keep forgetting, but I've gotten a few.  That's what I need to do.  Oh, God, was that funny.  What happened?  Jimmy got in an elevator full of people that have nothing to do with the show, and me, and  Kenny, and I'm standing against the wall, and the second the door's shut, it's real quiet,  you just hear, like a loud, juicy one. 
[02:24:30]  Did anyone say anything?  No, but I just hear, I was giggling the whole ride up.  I put this little envelope in front of my face, and you just heard, I was laughing so  hard.  Why is that funny?  Dude, it's every time, I'm just giggling like a five-year-old.  And there's a girl in there, too, there's like a woman, and just a horrid human you  are.  You barely qualify as human.  This is the weirdest thing ever, dude. 
[02:25:00]  What?  What's up?  Talking without a mic, you mean?  Yeah, I know.  Fucking sitting over there, putting the mic on a microphone.  Are you guys on air?  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  I said it.  I don't know if that's a good thing, man.  So many people ask that question.  What?  This is a show?  Wait, we're on the air?  Yes.  No, but this is just the weirdest thing ever, that we were just over there.  And now we're over here.  No, but then there's the walk, which is kind of surreal, on the street with mics, and  then all of a sudden you're up here, and...  No, we're over here now.  That is kind of weird, though, when you're in one place, and you actually walk, and you 
[02:25:30]  wind up in another.  What the hell kind of people are they?  What the hell?  What kind of people are you, these people?  Ma!  That's something.  Give me a pen, Steve, before I smack you in the face.  Please, William Barper.  That won't be done.  I got to talk to Scott in Virginia.  Scott.  Squat?  Yeah.  What's going on, man?  Hi, Squat.  Hey, y'all missed the best line of the show when y'all were walking over and talking to  Mac.  What did I say?  Jimmy said, they asked what channel he was listening to, and he said 88, and Jimmy said 
[02:26:00]  how was the last year he took a bath?  Thank you.  That was a good one.  Yes, I heard that, and it was very funny.  Thanks a lot for noticing.  You know, my contributions are so often looked over.  Jimmy, much humor.  Where's Jeff?  He snuck out.  He had to go to the View.  He had to go to the View.  He's got to go with a bunch of women.  He's got to hang out with the women folk.  A bunch of fucking hens. 
[02:26:30]  Yep.  We've got to watch him on the View now.  Because it'll be a different interview.  That's what it'll be.  It'll be an interview.  Well, I got a documentary.  Yes, it's about my travels in Iraq.  What are you...  Another banana.  I mean a banana, but Jimmy keeps looking at me every time I put it in my mouth.  You break it apart.  No, you don't.  You fucking break it apart.  What's wrong with you?  You break it apart, because when you eat it like that, Jimmy feels compelled to push on 
[02:27:00]  the back of your head.  That's right.  You don't know how to be fun.  Is it bad that I only eat bananas in a closet on my knees?  Go ahead.  In my panties?  That's right.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Close your eyes.  Eat that banana.  Dude!  He made a gag!  I'm sorry.  Oh, that was like slap happy.  Exactly.  I don't like that I gagged almost all the way down the banana, though.  You like the way he didn't push my hand away?  He was just like, come on, man, like a chick would do.  He looked at me like, why would you do that?  You know I'm going to gag?  I have to go slow.  You can take it.  This would actually be the perfect penis, though, the size right here. 
[02:27:30]  True.  If you were going to put something in your mouth, because some might...  You watch those blowjob movies, and they're too big.  They can only get the top in.  That's the best kind.  This would be the perfect size right here.  What do you think, Anthony?  You with me?  No.  Not at all.  You sure?  Thank you.  Positive.  Somebody sent me a trophy.  A what?  You got a trophy?  What did you get?  Aw, what does it say?  Jimmy's got some mail today.  There's a real...  He just opened up a box.  What is it, Jimmy?  I got a trophy. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, my God.  Why do you people do this?  Why do you entertain him?  It's...  Oh, my God.  Look at this trophy.  It's a gold cup.  It is.  And I've won a lot of awards.  Let me see this thing.  But when he wins awards, he gets nervous.  Show the pal-talk camera, please.  This one says,  Hey, Hawk, you want to hold that pal-talk camera up before this award sails off your forehead?  The trophy looks really big when you have it that close to the camera. 
[02:28:30]  I want you to back up the trophy so they can see the true size of this thing.  Well, how about pulling the camera back before...  There you go.  It says,  It's a gold cup.  It says...  I need to not send you a trophy.  Sweetest boy in studio.  Wow.  Lil' Jimmy Norton.  How nice.  And the good part is that the dumb motherfucker that sent me this goes L-I-L and puts the apostrophe 
[02:29:00]  after the second L.  In the wrong place.  You non-apostrophe-puttin' sack of shit.  You're lucky I don't find your mother and rape her with this trophy.  Apparently we're on XM now, right?  Yeah.  How about this, Ryan?  How about putting the apostrophe in the right place?  How weird is our lives?  This is like two different worlds.  We walk a tightrope over there, and as soon as we get over here, it's like, fuck this.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  The sweetest boy in studio wants to talk. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, God.  Damn.  Why do you guys feed into this?  It is odd that we're over there going, you know, watch the way, you know, because the  guy, all right, a guy was with a woman, and he put his stuff in a place that is pleasurable  to both the people involved.  And then a few walks, a few steps from studio to studio, he fucked her in the cunt.  Yeah, he raped her with a trophy.  Thank you.  He fucking stuck a trophy in the ass. 
[02:30:00]  In the ass.  Thank you very much.  Although it's not even, like, this was kind of like a no-brainer award.  Did it say, Jimmy has no brain?  Oh, it's a little Jimmy.  Oh, I thought, by no-brainer.  I'm the sweetest boy in studio.  What's it made out of?  Can I see your trophy, Jimmy?  No.  Please.  Because you were voted most likely to break something belonging to a sweet boy.  A sweet boy.  I forgot how fucking crazy Opie is.  Oh, that thing would be smashed.  Did I ever tell you?  I just want to step on it and bend it. 
[02:30:30]  When I was a boy.  I just want to put a big dent in it.  Just take one of the little handles and snap it.  I would put, I'm going to put this up on my mantle.  Oh, no.  Oh, by the end of this version of the show, that thing will be broken.  No.  I want to carry that with you wherever you go, Jimmy.  I'm jealous.  I want to actually go into the bathroom and shit in it.  And fill it to the top like peanut butter.  Could you let Bob Kelly shit in it?  Can I just take a shit in it?  Please.  A nice fat smash shit.  Please.  A big green, I haven't eaten meat in a week, nine day shit. 
[02:31:00]  Come on, Jimmy.  Let him shit in it and we'll get a picture.  And then you can take it home.  Let me tell you something, jealous people.  Yeah.  I am the sweetest boy in studio.  I would let Bob shit in my trophy if I had one.  Do you?  Well, then maybe you should win something.  You didn't win it.  When I was a boy at the gazebo in my town, I won the award for boy whose smile most resembles  a rainbow.  Oh. 
[02:31:30]  Fuck.  Let's say hi to Joseph in Jersey.  Joseph.  Hey, what's happening, boy?  Hey, Joseph.  Somebody mentioned that Little Jimmy makes a contribution to the show.  And I'm on my way to an HR meeting because of Little Jimmy's contributions to the show.  You've got to see human resources today?  Well, because I thought it was very funny when Jimmy said that he was in the men's room  at the urinal and he drops his pants to his ankles and hikes up his shirt real high.  Yeah.  And so I tried that and one of the bosses walked in and I'm in trouble now. 
[02:32:00]  Really?  Yeah, you've got to watch.  Oh, I didn't think it was anything in front of my men, you know?  What do you even do?  It's funny.  Apparently, it's not that funny.  So I don't know what the hell to do now.  Oh, I hate people that have to go to HR.  No.  I might lose my cue.  What kind of puffin' stuff?  Why?  They're human resources.  They're here to help us, right?  No, they're not.  Well, what do you think they can do to me?  I'm in a 1974 puppet joke. 
[02:32:30]  I don't even have a clue what they're going to call it.  Are you married?  Yeah.  Do you have to tell your wife what happened?  She kind of thinks I'm a weirdo anyway,  so I'm figuring she's not going to take it out of too much of her regular stride.  So when you can't pay the rent, her mother is going to be, what happened?  Oh, yeah, that would be great.  Oh, explain it at Thanksgiving.  It won't be Christmas, kids, because Daddy lost his job. 
[02:33:00]  I'm just screwed.  Can I come to work for you guys?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  You're sinking fast, my friend.  All right, thanks, sir.  I'm sorry.  Goodbye.  HR, what a waste of time.  A Block.  What up, motherfuckers?  What up?  Hey, my man.  I got my money on Dennis Leary having the most dumps for this week.  Yeah, where's our dump sheet?  Yeah, where's the dump sheet for today?  Come on.  And then we got to find out.  Shop, shop.  We got to find out who had the most dumps for the week. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, I would say Dennis, but that's like a guest, you think, out of everybody.  There's old Blockhead.  Oh, God, what a mess.  Looks like Hubba Bubba is holding her glasses together.  Old Blockhead.  That is Hubba Bubba.  She got caught having sex with a student, and this one will do a hard time because she's  not a looker.  She had sex with a guy student?  Yeah.  14-year-old boy.  Fuck, we didn't do this story yet either.  This guy you're looking at on TV right now, he's 5'1".  The judge will not be sending him to prison because he's too short for prison. 
[02:34:00]  And last on the list to get the sheet is Anthony.  Thank you.  That's because where you are, Anthony.  That's the only reason.  It doesn't matter.  Do you think if the president is at the end of the table?  It's on your safe corner.  It's almost impossible to get to you.  What did he do wrong, the little fella?  Well, the little fella, here it is.  I got the paper version.  Convicted child molester Richard Thompson is getting a big break.  A Nebraska judge saying the 5'1 fiend is too short to survive in prison gave him 10 
[02:34:30]  years probation instead.  It's probably not even kid-touching if you're that short.  So if you're a midget and you kill somebody, you don't go to prison?  Yeah, apparently not.  You don't.  You just don't go to prison because you're too short, and I guess the judge figured he'd  be abused in prison.  I wonder if there is a midget-like killer, if the midget ever killed somebody.  Never.  How fun would a midget be in prison to just beat up every day?  Make him suck your dick standing up in the shower? 
[02:35:00]  Make him hold your coffee?  Jimmy.  Is that a rod?  What are you doing?  Do you have a rod?  Why?  Do you have a rod?  Partial.  Is that a freaking boner?  Jimmy.  Dude, what's wrong with you?  It's everything that's right.  And it's on camera, like prominently displayed on camera.  Why would I get beat up today because I was holding another man's hand?  Well, at least it's my cock.  Why would I get beat up?  Just look at the mind.  Go ahead, Bob.  Grab it.  No, I'm not going to grab it.  You can see the shape of the helmet, the little Hitler helmet he has on it. 
[02:35:30]  No, you can't.  But it's bent.  Yeah, you can.  It's right there.  Dude, it's bent in like...  Look, right here.  It's in half.  No, that's not the helmet.  The helmet's back up here.  Oh, it's bent towards me.  It's going up?  Yeah.  It looks like a little friggin' fist in your pants.  Look, that's going down.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  That's where the helmet is right there.  Why are you...  Why are you...  I'm not hard.  I'm not going hard.  But why are you filling up at all?  Yeah, why?  Well, I don't know.  There's a pair of tits on the Paletal camera, which are rather lovely.  You pointed out the other day that you didn't really appreciate that girl. 
[02:36:00]  No, that's not the girl.  Yes, it is!  No, it's not.  I pointed.  I said, what about her?  No.  And you were like, no, I don't like her.  There was a problem.  There was a miscue.  I did it five times, I asked you.  Yeah, miscue.  I'm telling you.  Liar, liar.  Your heart on is on fire.  Can you stop rubbing it?  Shut up.  Mind your business.  Dude, you're basically jerking off on...  I'm fucking talking to people.  I am sweetest boy in the studio. 
[02:36:30]  Dude, I want to shit in your trophy.  That's why he got plump.  Dude, why?  Dude, stop holding it.  It's mine.  Yeah, but you hold...  Dude, do you understand what you're doing?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Dude, you're in a studio on a radio show.  Why can't you spit banana onto the microphone, you fucking monkey?  In front of a bunch of guys.  In front of all men, and you're holding and rubbing the tip of your cock.  What, do you want it to fill up more?  Keep describing.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Nothing.  I'm not hard.  Can you stop touching it? 
[02:37:00]  Just let it go away?  Let it go away, dude.  He keeps grabbing it going, I'm not hard, and it's getting bigger and bigger.  No, no, no.  It's not.  What are you doing?  Are you taking it out?  No, no.  Are you taking it out?  No.  What's wrong with you?  Dude, there's that crazy guy.  Jesus Christ.  Could somebody get him a wardrobe from 2000?  Why is he here?  I don't know.  But he's wearing glasses like Mr. Gazzo in Rocky.  He's, um, my sister's boyfriend's friend from Chicago.  Wow.  Okay.  His boyfriend has his helmet head hair also. 
[02:37:30]  Does he?  Not talking into a mic that's on?  What, Kenny?  He's got that helmet head hair.  Oh, God.  All right.  Oh, the dump report.  Yes.  Yes.  What do we have in front of us?  Here it is.  What about it?  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  Is someone going to take all the dump reports for the week and give us the, you know, the  tally of who got dumped out the most?  Maybe the top three or something?  I have a bone of contention to pick here.  A what?  A bone of contention.  Me too. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, what does that really mean?  You know what?  I don't like that big word shit.  He's breaking his bone of contention.  I don't really.  I don't know what that means either.  What is a bone of contention?  What are you doing?  All right, Jimmy.  Sit the fuck down with your rod and get rid of it.  I want to get a piece of paper and a pencil and sketch over it.  Etch it like at the Vietnam War Memorial where they do it with the names.  Can you please do that?  Yeah, give me a white piece of paper.  Anybody have a white piece of paper and a pencil?  We need a pencil and a white piece of paper immediately. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, kind of go over it softly and get the etching of Jimmy's junk.  Etch one of the veins?  Oh, God.  Why are you grabbing it?  Could you put it over towards Anthony?  Can you hedge your penis north instead of south?  No.  Here, let me see.  Come here.  I'm not letting you fucking put a pencil point on my dick.  Come here.  I'm just going to etch it.  I'm going to etch it.  Wait, wait, wait.  Oh, my God.  He's etching it. 
[02:39:00]  Wait, I'm going to go sideways.  Jesus, E-Rock.  Dude, wait.  Can you hear it bouncing off his spongy cock?  You don't have it on camera, E-Rock.  E-Rock, you got his hand on camera, you fucking boob of epic proportions.  Right there.  That's good.  Right there.  This is the gayest thing I've ever allowed someone to do to me.  Yeah, this is pretty gay.  Not even back.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy's grabbing the back of his head. 
[02:39:30]  Buck's not resisting.  I have to keep sketching more because he's getting hotter and hotter as I do it.  You can't see anything.  It's just sloppy.  And you don't have to have your hand in my pubis to hold it all back.  Where did the Elmer glue come from?  Yeah, the paper's wet.  You know what?  No, you can't see it, but if you really look closely, look at it.  See?  You don't need to look closely.  Now you can see it.  Thanks for being a good sport and doing that.  You're welcome.  Thanks for letting me sketch your penis.  You're welcome.  All right.  All right.  Dump report, right?  Yeah. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report.  Here are your dumps.  Fuck.  Your dumps.  For Friday, 5-26-06.  Fuck.  At 7-19, Robert Kelly uttered the word, fuck, and was dumped out of.  Don't make the sad face, Opie.  I'm sorry.  At 7-40, Robert Kelly said his fingers feel like little circumcised penises. 
[02:40:30]  You can't say penis?  No, no.  You can't, in the whole contest, fingers feeling like circumcised penis.  No, it's not making it through.  I'm sorry.  Anthony, and this is the one I'm not taking credit for.  I don't want this added to the dump.  This wasn't me.  This is Than screwing up.  This was pre-recorded from our XM show.  Atta boy.  Which we can say shit.  I said holy shit to Rich's act at Pick a Bagel. 
[02:41:00]  We were on XM at the time.  We then, somebody burnt it to a disc, brought it over, replayed it, and it slipped through.  So that is not me.  I'm not taking credit for that one.  That's our ex-employee, Thin.  Yes.  At 8-16, what do they got?  Artie Lang's sperm in here.  Howard's splooge.  Jeff Ross, after touching something sticky in the studio.  And then Jeffrey, at 8-21, they're whacking off to cloud formations. 
[02:41:30]  That's a gray area.  Yeah, you can't really say the word.  That's not bad.  There's nothing pornographic about clouds.  That's not bad.  Clouds.  Couldn't be the whacking off part.  Should have dumped out of you, scratching Jimmy's cock with a pencil.  By the way, Cody in Indiana.  Cody.  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  Hey, Jim.  You said that Bob tracing your cock is the gays thing you've ever let a guy do to you.  So, if Bob puts on a wig and throws you in a car somewhere, is that gay? 
[02:42:00]  Nope.  No.  Well, touche.  Punch it out.  That was the second time.  Oh, shit.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to General Bam.  General Bam, what's up?  Nothing much.  I know, Opie, you've been asking a lot of questions about, you know, when do the pets listen, when do the non-fans listen?  Wait, wait, wait.  What happened?  Why did Bob Kelly run out of the studio?  Why did our guests have to run out of the studio?  You know, he's a guest on the program today.  He's scared.  What'd you do to him?  Did you fart?  I'm just jealous of my trophy. 
[02:42:30]  And it stinks?  What'd you do to him?  I cupped the fart.  Your ass is the nastiest.  Don't ever do that.  Sorry, you don't want to trace my cock?  Shut up.  That's hot.  Don't cupped.  Dude, he stuck his hand on his ass, cupped it, and then threw it in my face like a fucking smelly baseball.  Isn't it amazing how you can throw gas?  No, I cast a spell. 
[02:43:00]  You're the smelly wizard.  That almost made me throw up, dude.  I always voted, boy, most likely to cast a spell.  General Bam, yes.  Yeah, so I know you've been asking a lot of these questions recently, wanting polls up on, you know, the message board.  So we decided to put together a long poll that had around 50 questions, and all the message boards are participating in this one.  It's up on every single message board, and you're getting responses to questions of, like, whether or not you like to move to CBS. 
[02:43:30]  And, of course, surprisingly, the people who love it far outweigh the bitchers that are complaining about stuff.  So we'll have results from you, free for you guys, and around a week from that, and you guys can find that on any of the, what, five, six message boards that's up there.  And also...  Wow, a cooperative effort.  You guys are actually working together for once?  Yeah, it's on Wackbag.  It's on Full Blown A's.  It's on WowFans.  It's on PostHorror.net, wherever, XM411. 
[02:44:00]  All of them are...  So that way, you know, I think a lot of people get tunnel vision when they're on a message board.  They think everyone else from every other message board or every non-message board people feel the same way.  And I think this is going to show them that a lot of people don't feel the way they do,  and it's just their message board that happens to feel that way, and that's why the show does certain things.  Yep.  All right.  We were talking about message boards before, and this post got me. 
[02:44:30]  Did you notice how Elo, this is the whole thing of the thread, is called Elo getting fed up?  Hmm?  Did you notice how Elo used his executive trump card in today's discussion, meaning yesterday,  saying the decisions were his prerogative, which they are, and being decidedly terse with Jimmy?  Mm-mm.  Opie did not say a word during Elo's explanation. 
[02:45:00]  He only chined in at the end when he said that the serious Elo was no fun.  Now the speculation.  You think the boys may be starting to burn a bridge with all the pitting they are doing with XM and CBS?  Elo obviously has been censoring certain aspects for a while.  Yuck.  Elo is calling in to comment on the censoring of Lil Jimmy's racially charged promo for Sunday's Laugh Factory show.  Laugh Factory? 
[02:45:30]  I'm reading it, what he said.  Stress Factory.  He got it wrong.  Elo said the uncensored commercial can be played now, but I'm still hearing the censored version.  So this guy thinks there's a conspiracy now that we're trying to undermine XM.  We're pitting XM against CBS.  J.B. Louisville, you stink.  You're dope.  You're an ass.  What happened was, after Elo called in, now Elo does not bust our balls over content. 
[02:46:00]  He's a great boss.  And we like him on a personal level.  And you know what?  To be honest with you, he has the programming decisions.  If he doesn't want something on, it's not going to be on.  Because he has the final say.  Like, a lot of times...  Sorry, I'm finishing my smoothie.  It's delicious.  It really is good, isn't it?  Every drop.  No, Elo can do whatever he wants.  I miss any.  And he doesn't censor us.  And this was one that was censored. 
[02:46:30]  And what happened was, we went in the other room.  And we recorded...  Boring.  Another version of the original...  Boring.  Promotion.  Now...  The promotion...  Ah, did you see that jerk?  And then what happened was, the promotion went too good.  And then Eric calls in, and he definitely has the ability to take something off if he doesn't want it on. 
[02:47:00]  So we go in there to the studio again.  Right.  And we rework it.  Quiet.  But I say to Steve...  Quiet.  I say Steve.  Quiet.  I bring Ben, I go, Ben.  Stop it!  Stop whining!  I say, play the editor.  Stop whining!  It was my decision...  Quiet.  After Elo gave permission to play the unedited version, I said...  He's a fag!  Out of respect for Eric Logan...  Hey bud, what's your problem? 
[02:47:30]  ...play the edited version, because obviously there's something in there that he's worried about.  And Eric typically does not do that.  Uh-huh.  I allowed him...  Not allowed him, I told Steve and Benny...  It sucks.  And you know, I said...  It sucks.  Let's just make sure that...  It sucks.  The edited version plays, because they're good to us here with content.  And it like wasn't, to me, a problem to just kind of play that version. 
[02:48:00]  So I said to Steve and I said to Benny, I said, we can maybe just like rework it.  And we reworked it.  And we have a version that people will like and enjoy.  But we didn't want to play the unedited version, because Eric Logan can normally do whatever he wants to do.  Because the plot...  And I felt that in the spirit of fairness, there was no real reason to upset him. 
[02:48:30]  I didn't want to upset him.  So me and Stevie go in the other room.  And Benny comes in.  And Eric's there.  And we go...  Shut your goddamn pie hole!  We go, let's just rework this one.  You better get your head and your ass wired together, or I will take a giant shit out of you.  So we reworked the whole thing.  Join you!  But I feel that in the meantime, the best thing to do is to play the unedited version.  Because if there's something in there that he's not comfortable with, I didn't want to upset him further. 
[02:49:00]  Because he's been very fair with us as far as stuff that he's allowed and stuff that he hasn't allowed.  And I didn't...  A lot of times, it's not a matter of censorship.  If there's something that makes Eric uncomfortable, I have to respect that.  Because even as a boss, he didn't owe me an explanation.  And yet he is.  He still called me at home, and we talked a little while.  But my cockatrop tried to call him back.  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  Show me with your mouth. 
[02:49:30]  I called him back for a little while, but then he got another call.  And I had to call him back.  And I'm like, what's going on?  And he goes, well, maybe you guys know that I don't answer you.  And I'm like, no, no, I know you don't.  Nope knows it, and Ant knows it.  And Steve knows it, and Benny knows it.  And so we were talking for a while, and he goes, I don't like to censor you.  I like to let you do what you want to do.  And then I'm like, all right, well, I appreciate it.  And I go, well, I told Steve and Benny, and I think I mentioned... 
[02:50:00]  Wait, did I mention Eric?  I don't know if I mentioned Erop, but then I go, I told them to play the edited version.  And he goes, thank you, I appreciate that.  Even though you didn't have to do that.  So it really wasn't a matter of him interfering.  It was more a matter of me kind of realizing something bothered him, and him having been so good to us.  I felt it was okay for me to kind of just go, you know what?  But this is not worth upsetting Elo for, because he is a good boss. 
[02:50:30]  And I didn't, you know what I mean?  It's like the guy didn't have to call me, but he still did.  And I felt kind of good about that.  So, you know, I mean, we do have a reworked version, because I didn't want to offend anybody.  Kindly shut your noise hole.  It's only about, like, having a good time and promoting the Stress Factory game for this week.  And that really is all I wanted to do.  And yet, it wound up being like there was something else going on that I wasn't too aware of here at XM.  And so I really didn't want to, like, you know, cause a problem or give anybody any kind of flack or have anybody get upset. 
[02:51:00]  So me and Stevie sat down and Benny came in.  And E-Rock was coming in and out, but I was working it a couple different ways.  Because I wanted the promotion to get done.  Like, I wanted to have my Stress Factory promotion for this weekend.  And yet, I wanted to remove anything that might be offensive.  Whether it was to, like, you know, Eric Logan or Sean Panero.  Or Gary Hahn.  Or anybody else that may work with him.  Or maybe the cool guy.  Or, like, you know, Cal Ripken Jr. on the baseball station.  Or anybody. 
[02:51:30]  Like, people from NASCAR or people from so many different stations that are on XM.  I didn't want anybody to feel like we were kind of providing their wishes.  They're very good to us as far as what they allow us to talk about.  And E-Rock kept coming in and going, like, what's going on, guys?  And I would say to Steve, like, how's it coming, Steve?  And he was like, he's got the new Mac in there.  Remember, Marge, put the Mac in there for you.  And so I'm like, dude, this is so much faster.  But it gets hot in there.  Whereas it used to not be as hot.  But now it's, like, really hot.  I'm like, dude, what's going on?  He goes, well, the Mac makes the whole thing really crazy. 
[02:52:00]  And so we were in there for, like, what, maybe a half hour, 45 minutes?  I mean, it was probably something like that.  Hold on, too.  It was probably something like that.  And so, like, you know, just called me and, like, wanted to say thank you.  You didn't have to do that.  But it wasn't a matter of having to do it.  I mean, being the boss, he could pretty much say and do whatever he wants to say and do.  And yet he always, like, takes good care of us.  He always looks out for the channel.  And, like, let's be honest.  I mean, NXM has been no bigger supporter than Eric Logan.  So, like, the guy speculating on, was it openathlete.net or was it postwords.net or was it whackbag.com or fullblownace.com? 
[02:52:30]  I'm not sure what that guy actually posted.  But I felt that, you know, sometimes, like, you know, you have to understand that you have to pick your battles.  And this wasn't a battle.  Even though Eric Logan told me, like, you can do what you want to do.  I said, there's no need for me to fight this battle because Eric's a good guy.  And he's, like, a friend, even though he's a boss.  I mean, being a boss and a friend, it's very rare.  But he didn't pull the executive from car.  I mean, he is the executive.  He is the president of programming for this company.  He falls under Hugh Pinero.  And he falls under another guy whose name I can't remember, Gary Parsons. 
[02:53:00]  Like, Gary Parsons, I think, is, like, the CEO.  And he probably would not have appreciated that either because it was kind of racially insensitive that we have Oprah Winfrey coming on.  Even though Eric didn't say that to me, I kind of suspect that's what it was.  But it wasn't like he owed me any kind of an explanation.  I mean, let's be honest.  Would I have gotten away with that at CBS?  I probably would not have gotten away with that at CBS.  Even though, like, none of that stuff is technically an FCC violation.  It's all kind of, like, really, really dirty and offensive on a different level.  It's not unnecessarily an FCC violation that you're going to get fined for. 
[02:53:30]  But you're probably going to get a lot.  We need to remember that we are professionals in the entertainment industry.  You know, the funny thing is, too.  Here comes the world's dumbest jingle.  At least it's a fucking jingle.  I'll show the world I'm a funny guy.  I'll throw in some sound effects and  A few lines that don't make no sense and  Hope an ant will be so proud of me.  Thank, epic, God.  I've missed the point completely.  I should kill myself discreetly. 
[02:54:00]  This jingle will serve as my suicide.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  My life's been kind of rough.  And 18 years is long enough.  My dad should have hopped the gun away.  Yay!  I got nothing.  Let me see them, Bobby!  It's the Opie and Anthony Wow Motorcycle Run, Wednesday, June 21st,  leaving from 57th and 6th in New York City at 6.30 a.m. 
[02:54:30]  and finishing at Bill's Bar on Lansdowne Street in Boston at 11 a.m. for an after-party.  For more information or to participate, email Keith at foundrymusic.com.  Check out the events section on opieandthony.com for details and directions.  That's Wednesday, June 21st, when you're sitting at 6.30 a.m.  and arriving in Boston at Bill's Bar on Lansdowne Street.  We all have to have some kind of flexibility, because if you don't have any kind of flexibility,  you're never going to have a comfortable work environment.  Because Elof has always been really good at it. 
[02:55:00]  I can't even complain. He's been really, really terrific.  And I think the important thing is that everybody works together.  If there's a team effort, then when there's a miscommunication,  if they're going to get together and off, it feels really, really off.  Good about this, how they have to do it, because there's no way that we should all walk away from that.  What?  You done?  Are you finished?  Are you all done, Jim?  Are you done?  Yeah, did you not hear that? I'll repeat it.  No, no, no, no, no.  That's fine.  Look, I wrote it all down, see? 
[02:55:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks for checking us out.  Bob Kelly in studio.  Dumps for the week.  Where is it?  Dumps for the week, Anthony.  Ah.  Going to see who has the biggest potty mouth every week on the first half of the Opie and Anthony Show,  the weekly dump chart that ended today.  Congratulations go out to Anthony.  Of course they do.  One dump for Anthony this week.  One.  And that's when we really pissed him off with Tippy Tom. 
[02:56:00]  We were trying to get Tippy Tom to touch him, and he says,  I'm not, what did you say?  I'm not, I'm not effing kidding.  Or, yeah, I'm not.  But I said fucking.  Yeah.  I said, I'm not fucking kidding.  I will leave if you, uh.  He was really pissed.  He was trying to get the.  Because Anthony takes pride in being perfect on the first half of the Opie and Anthony Show.  David Hasselhoff crying.  Yeah, I know.  Finally saw that.  Faggot.  It is the greatest moment in TV history.  Cockrider, his new show.  David Hasselhoff crying.  Cockrider.  Actually, I find that very funny. 
[02:56:30]  Thanks, Dan.  There's another moment from American Idol we haven't played yet.  Meatloaf trying to hit a, hit a, hit a note.  To, trying to rev up that old voice of his.  You ever been to a wedding where the guys are on one side of the room and the girls are on the other end?  They sing, stop right there.  I will be loved forever.  And the girls chime in.  That's great.  And the girls go, stop right there.  And the guy goes, no.  And you hear.  Here we go.  Weekly dump chart.  Anthony, one dump. 
[02:57:00]  Of course.  I'm surprised Mr. Perfect had that many.  Congratulations, Anthony.  One dump.  Thank you.  He wins again.  Jeffrey Ross, two dumps.  Bob Kelly, two dumps for the week.  But he only had one appearance.  Patrice O'Neill, two dumps for the week.  Tippi Tom, three dumps for the week.  Lenny Clark.  All in his pants.  Three dumps for the week.  Callers.  Gonna have to try.  Well, I shouldn't say that.  No.  No, no, no.  We did.  No, no, no.  Don't do that.  No, no, no, no, no.  Please.  Callers, three. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, shit.  What were you, dude?  Callers, three dumps.  Jim Norton, third place, six dumps.  That's the noise I make when I get flustered.  I had eight dumps for the week.  Eight dumps for Opie.  Eight dumps.  And I've been in radio the longest.  Yeah.  And finally, the winner of the weekly dump chart, Dennis Leary, 15 dumps.  15 times we got the dumps out of this conversation. 
[02:58:00]  Get off me, Jim.  Everything is context.  It was words.  He's saying fuck.  He's saying cocksucker.  He's talking about fucking.  And loads.  Yeah, loads.  And it was a bunch of just stuff you can't say.  Stuff you can't.  Anyone knows you can't say it.  All right.  A lot of phone calls.  Inbred, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to take the opportunity to call in and thank you all for the five to six  hours of quality entertainment you provide us every day.  I think the CBS deal is great, and the show keeps getting better and better every day. 
[02:58:30]  Just wanted to say thanks, guys.  What do you like about the new show?  I like that.  Good for him.  He hung up.  I hate when that happens.  Dee Dee.  Hi.  Hi, Dee Dee.  I'm recovering from surgery, and I'm fucked up on dope.  Whoa.  Wait a minute.  What kind of surgery do you have?  I had, um, they went in my nose, and they did work on my sinus surgery.  Sinus surgery.  I want to get that. 
[02:59:00]  When did you get it done?  The other day.  How do you feel?  Fucked up.  Okay.  Did it hurt?  Hell yeah.  Can you breathe?  No.  I have this, like, hardest thing around my nose for the blood drip.  Wait a minute.  So you had problems with your sinuses, and you got them operated on so you could breathe  better?  Better, excuse me?  Breathe better, and not get as many.  I had chronic sinusitis.  When are they going to work on your mouth?  I had sinus infections.  Is that going to affect your voice, like, being high like it is?  No, my voice will stay the same once the packing comes out of my nose. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the problem.  That's what I was afraid of.  When are they going to narrow the pathway from your mouth to your stomach?  When are they going to staple your stomach?  Oh, B.  Stop.  Why would you say that, Bobby?  That's cruel.  I didn't say that.  Bobby, DeeDee's one of my favorite people.  Are you in a hospital, DeeDee?  Might as well take care of all the problems.  I was in a hospital the other day.  Oh.  But my boss took...  Dude!  He'll email them to you.  No one, man.  He picked me up. 
[03:00:00]  Why does our guest keep leaving?  Bob, stop being unprofessional.  I'm ignoring him.  Yeah.  Of course you are.  You're doped up.  Well, Jimmy keeps cupping farts and throwing them at him.  Stop cupping.  He's casting spells.  Just let it happen.  You guys are...  Just let it...  That's against fart law, dude.  You can't cup it.  Not only can I, but it's just...  What's that, DeeDee?  You know what happened?  And my boss took a picture of it.  It was like stigmatia.  There was blood coming out of my eye ducts.  With no dressing.  Your eye ducts had blood coming out of it?  Blood.  What are you called? 
[03:00:30]  Stig what?  Stigmatia.  My boss said it was like stigmatia.  Stigmatia.  Stigmatia.  Stigmatia.  It's kind of like stigmata with an extra I in there.  It's stigmatia.  I used to live next door to that guy in Brooklyn.  But there is blood coming out of it.  No.  Italian sounding.  Um, excuse me.  That was awful.  And those are just the people.  So what are you doped up on, DeeDee?  Well, at the hospital they had me on morphine.  And they also had me...  Because I had allergic reactions.  So then they put me on something else.  But right now I'm on like Vicodin.  I was on Vicodin when I hurt my knee. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  That's a nice drug.  That is a great drug.  Because I've been 12 years clean and sober.  It's like I'm like feeling it.  You know what you do?  Yeah, see?  DeeDee, this is what you do.  Crush up the Vicodin and snort it.  No, don't tell me you do that.  No, don't do it.  It's like packing in my nosy face.  Yeah.  But is there a drip where you can breathe through?  Is there like a little tube you can breathe through?  Too bad they couldn't pack your mouth for two weeks.  Yeah.  What's that?  No, you can't breathe through your nose.  They pack it.  No, I breathe through my mouth.  With gauze all the way to the back of your throat. 
[03:01:30]  They said it was like tampons in my nose.  I heard they can put a tube in there that you can breathe through too though.  Yeah.  Once the packing...  The lower packing has to come out, then it can...  Then that's where the breathing is.  It's not going to be easy, Jimmy.  I got to get that done tomorrow.  Tomorrow?  I just want to...  Are you really having it done, Jimmy?  Yeah, but I have stress factory gigs.  And he's scared.  You know what?  It's okay.  I get scared, DeeDee.  You're going to do it, but you're at the stress factory?  I...  Yeah.  It's painful though.  Yeah. 
[03:02:00]  I don't want it being...  All right, DeeDee.  Say satin.  Satin?  Satin.  Satin?  Say Australia.  Australia?  Australia.  Australia.  It's not the same with the shit in your nose.  Call back when you're better.  All right, DeeDee.  Hey, DeeDee, what is like...  What was the ultimate goal of getting this done?  The ultimate goal...  Jesus.  Oh, that is horrible.  She's all dumped up.  Poor gal.  When are you going to get that operation on your mouth?  Oh.  What?  What happened? 
[03:02:30]  Eric in New York, what's up?  How much packing does it take to fill it?  Yeah, good morning, Roy.  It's cutting.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  Sometimes my brain overcomes...  It overrules judgment and friendship and things like that.  I'm sorry.  Sinus surgery.  Well, apparently you have some hay and grass caught in here. 
[03:03:00]  A couple of peanuts.  A couple of peanuts.  And I had to have my ears reduced.  Eric, what's up?  When they want to discharge you from the hospital quickly, they just throw a mouse in the room.  The technical word is tuskectomy.  She's going to get tail surgery. 
[03:03:30]  Is she?  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Is she?  Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.  Oh.  Oh.  Trump.  All right, why don't we do something for the people, huh?  Cleveland man caught jerking in library.  Video on website.  That video would be opianthony.com.  I want to welcome a Cleveland.  Let's see a clip of this stuff.  Hawker.  23-year-old Mike Cooper was busted whacking to porn at the library in Cleveland, just across 
[03:04:00]  the room from the children's section.  Oh.  Watch how pissed Mike's father gets when the news crew shows up at his house.  Uh-oh.  Wow.  The video's up online.  I want to see it.  Hawker's cock.  All right, we got three clips here.  Hawker's cock.  Hawker's cock.  Hawker's cock.  I got a big cock.  Hawker's cock.  List of offenses found at the Cleveland libraries.  Hawker's cock.  Book theft may be the least of the library's security problems.  We reviewed incident reports from libraries in Cleveland and throughout Cuyahoga County. 
[03:04:30]  Hawker's cock.  In just the past six months, we found more than 50 cases of violence, pornography, and sex.  A patron robbed at gunpoint.  A man downloading and printing child porn.  Used condoms found on the computer room floor.  Teens having sex on a sink in the men's room.  Having oral sex.  Male final self while looking at a 13-year-old girl.  Jesus, what's going on in this library?  What the fuck kind of library? 
[03:05:00]  Any time I've gone to a library, it's been the most boring place.  I know.  I'm glad they're fucking on the sink, though.  I'm glad I'm passing that on to younger generations.  Everybody's jerking off fucking, stalking, stalking.  Fucking eating.  I can't even write the book with her, Manny.  Her fucking womb is so polluted.  Her doidecimal system drawer is so polluted.  Go librarian!  I fucked her from A to Z.  The next clip is Mike Cooper confronted by the reporter as he, I guess, was whacking it there 
[03:05:30]  at the library.  You, uh, what do you look up on the internet?  Nothing, really.  Um, my sports scores, stuff like that.  Sports, pornography, stuff like that?  No.  Why?  I don't know why.  You tell me why.  I don't look up pornography, so, no.  You ever perform a sexual act at the library?  No, I have not.  You ever seen a grown man make it?  What if I told you we got video of you performing a sexual act?  Well, it wasn't me. 
[03:06:00]  We can't really show you, but that's Mike Cooper pleasuring himself while watching porn  at the Berea library.  Why not?  Just across the room from the children's section.  Take our word for it.  It's not in the children's section.  And his.  You just reached out and grabbed yourself and started having sex?  I did what I, I wasn't thinking.  I made a mistake.  Oh, so we've seen adults looking up the sites and actually having sex in the library.  Oh, my God.  That's horrible. 
[03:06:30]  Is that the librarian that's supposed to be in charge?  Yeah.  I think pleasuring himself is actually dirtier than saying jerking off.  But for a library card, I carve him up real nice.  You expect me to believe my books are overdue because Sosa said so?  You guys are fucking retarded. 
[03:07:00]  You guys are fucking retarded.  We got Matt in Jersey.  He wants to tell us how to properly whack off in a library.  Ah, good.  All right, Matt.  What's up?  Yeah, I was wearing the pictures and I'm a walkover.  But I go to Florida State University.  I'm in there for like study sessions and shit for like six hours.  So what you got to do, you download the porn, you put it out, you go in with the instrument  and jerk it.  How fucking hard is that?  Fuck.  They're fucking doing brothers. 
[03:07:30]  That's great.  I want to join in, but I got nothing.  I got nothing.  I'm just going to...  All right, the final clip.  Mike's parents unload on a reporter who was in their front lawn interviewing Mike.  So the reporter's interviewing the dude that was whacking off in the library and the parents 
[03:08:00]  unload on the reporter.  You live with your parents?  Yes.  What do you think they're going to think when they see this?  They're going to kill me.  I don't like you getting in my face either or my son's face.  But not before taking their anger out on us.  He's a son doing it on the public in a public place, exposing himself and having...  I said get out of here.  Get the fuck out of here.  Now.  Do you want me to take that thing away from you and stick to the...  Threatening behavior at the computer inside your neighborhood library and at the Cooper 
[03:08:30]  residence.  I'm a combat vet.  And if you want me to bring my goddamn core to you, you son of a...  I will.  And you won't f*** like it.  Wow.  Is that Anthony?  I'm a combat vet.  Watch it.  There you have it.  The video is up on where?  Break.com?  They're jacking off in libraries because the computer's there. 
[03:09:00]  And his father, too.  No wonder he's jerking off in a library.  I used to get stimulated in the library when I was a kid because I'd go in, like I said,  to the photography section.  Yeah, listen.  What?  The photography section.  And there'd be books on photography and you'd always find nudes.  Did you say stimulated?  Yeah.  I said stimulated.  He's from another era.  I wouldn't jack off.  It's not me, right?  He said stimulated.  I wouldn't jerk off or nothing. 
[03:09:30]  You know?  But I'd like get a boner and sit there and just look at the nudity.  But you'd refrain from tickling your own fancy.  Right.  Wouldn't tickle my fancy.  You'd just remain stimulated?  Yeah, just stimulated.  Until it passed?  I would stimulate myself and then, you know, I'd use it later on as like a reference.  All right.  Why don't you just go to the bathroom?  When was this?  The bathroom.  It's like a school library.  When was this? 
[03:10:00]  You're going to go in the bathroom.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  I'm just going to jerk off in here.  Works for me.  I'm Anthony.  I've been stimulated.  What did you ask?  When was this?  When was this?  Yeah.  Last week?  The house on the prairie days with a single room schoolhouse.  That was 1970s.  Early, you know, 70s.  What did you do, Jim?  Where's that video, Paul?  Trying to get it.  Well, let's not try.  Let's do.  Oh.  And then it was that.  It was some medical books.  Sometimes if the girl's disease wasn't that bad. 
[03:10:30]  But she had to have all her clothes off.  You'd have that black strip over her eyes.  So you couldn't tell who it was.  And she'd be standing there naked in some clinical, like, mug shot.  And, you know, as long as it wasn't psoriasis or something.  So what?  She has scoliosis.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tits on her.  Yeah.  Scoliosis wasn't bad, you know.  As long as everything was in place.  That's really funny.  That disease wasn't so bad.  You kind of look at that doctor's books, you know. 
[03:11:00]  And what else were there?  Some art books.  But that's paintings.  That kind of sucked.  You wanted photos.  That's weird.  I forget about that.  You had to get it where you could.  There were no fucking computers.  Come on.  Yeah, that's right.  That's right.  You had to get it.  I forget.  All right.  Jerk off to an abacus.  Yeah, good morning, boys.  Good morning.  That should have gotten a better laugh.  I didn't hear it.  It's kind of off the subject.  I'm not going to refer you to that.  I honestly didn't hear what you said.  I'm going to pass and not repeat.  What did you say?  Even though it could get a laugh.  Say it again.  It was good. 
[03:11:30]  Not in a funny way to say it.  Just state it.  State it.  No, no.  State it.  Mark.  That's all you're out of here.  Cool.  Thanks.  Eric.  Yeah, I wanted to ask.  It's kind of off the subject.  I wanted to ask Bob Kelly a question about the colonic.  Yes, sir.  What's up, buddy?  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Shouldn't you notice that something was wrong when she hooked up the hose to Eric's pit? 
[03:12:00]  Wow.  Okay.  We've been here how long?  In the crater.  How long?  No, sir.  Nineteen months.  We've been here about nineteen months.  Yes, that was the worst joke ever.  Absolutely.  There is no...  No, no.  You try to call something back from yesterday.  Because you thought of it when you heard it on the replay.  And I saved him yesterday because I saw it on the screen.  I said, this is so bad.  I'm not going to go to it.  But he was so confident that he decided to call back today.  And the way he said Eric, it sounded like Eric Spitz. 
[03:12:30]  I like Opie teaches people lessons.  Of course I remember.  I'm trying to save your ass.  It was awful yesterday.  It's awful today.  I was trying to call the date of the show.  Could you repeat it the exact way you just said it?  No, I will not.  No, no.  Because the wording on the last part of it, I'm trying to help you.  You try it again.  Try it again.  He also typed it in the instant feedback yesterday.  Did he?  No, no.  I don't use instant feedback.  Dude, will you...  There's someone else there.  Let me hear...  God damn it.  I want to stop the trouble, I guess.  Dude.  What? 
[03:13:00]  Stop with your asshole.  I got scared.  Dude, you're farting on me, dude.  You're fucking creepier.  I got scared, Bob.  What kind of asshole are you?  He, um...  Dude, just repeat it.  Why?  Yeah, how did you do it?  I want the exact wording because that's what's important here.  Will Jimmy help me out afterwards?  No, listen.  Yes.  Go ahead.  Let's try it again.  Ready?  Just do it.  Hey, what's up, man?  How you doing?  Hey, Bob.  What's up, dude?  Listen, I wanted to find out.  Didn't you notice something was wrong when she hooked up the hose to the colonic machine  to Eric Spitz?  To Eric Spitz?  Oh, to Eric Spitz? 
[03:13:30]  What?  His asshole smells like rants.  Dude, do you know how hard it is to understand the last part of what you're saying?  That's the problem.  No, hook up the drink to Eric Spitz.  Eric Spitz.  He was an Olympic swimmer, his brother.  Do it slow, dude.  I cannot understand a fucking word.  I understand the whole thing.  Let's try it again.  Let's try it again.  Ready?  Here we go.  Here we go.  Stop beating me up.  Dude, no.  Honest to God.  I'm not car crashing.  At the end, at the end, just slow down and say it.  Be very, you know, say it very...  Enunciate.  Enunciate.  That's the word.  Thank you for the big word, fucking Anthony.  Don't enunciate.  Wait a minute. 
[03:14:00]  Let's start.  Relax.  Apparently you haven't taken an acting course.  Go.  Ready?  And let's go.  Action.  Hey, what's up, dude?  Bob.  What's up, dude?  When you took the colonics, you shouldn't have noticed that something was wrong?  Oh, right, right, right.  Right.  When she hooked up the hose to Eric Spitz.  Eric Spitz doesn't make sense, dude.  Eric Spitz.  It wasn't his spit.  It was his...  How about this?  E-Rock Spitz.  No, he's still spitting.  E-Rock Spitz.  So what are these spits?  Well, Eric doesn't spit.  Thank God. 
[03:14:30]  Eric Spitz.  We got really good phone calls standing by.  This guy stinks.  No, it's not a bad joke.  I just don't understand the punchline.  How does Eric spit?  What does that mean?  Eric Spitz.  We all spit, sir.  What are you saying?  Spits.  What is spits?  Spits.  Okay, Eric...  Why does he spit?  That's what we're asking.  Focusing on what the fuck we're saying.  Why does he spit?  Eric's armpits.  Ah, oh, Eric's armpits. 
[03:15:00]  Thank you.  You dope.  That was a fucking Autobahn pileup.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  Trunker Jeff, go.  Hey, yeah, man.  When I was in the public libraries,  they used to jerk off all the time  to the breastfeeding books.  They had the best...  Oh, okay, breastfeeding books.  You'd have to be very creative to find...  What would you look at, the kid or the kid? 
[03:15:30]  They're fucking awesome,  and they're working, man.  It created, like, a whole fetish for me.  Now I'm, like, totally into, like,  pregnant chicks and breastfeeding and stuff.  Can we have a contest?  No.  Amongst the guys here, like,  E-Rock will do it.  Danny would definitely do it.  Send him to, like, Barnes & Noble  to find stuff they could jerk off to.  I'd be there, dude.  Barnes & Noble.  Let's see.  Yeah, you could find jacking material there.  Yeah.  Best jacking material book.  And whoever finds the...  Yeah, the best jacking material book.  The hottest jacking material book. 
[03:16:00]  At the bookstore, we'll give them a day off.  That's pretty good.  And we'll jack them off all over the place.  Why can't we get...  And we'll jack them off the material.  We'll all get together and play Cum Cookie.  What?  Why can't we get involved?  I bet I can find great jacking material.  Yeah, we'll be.  You're actually going to go out in public?  No.  No.  I'll go to Amazon.com.  Anthony will bring a book called  A Germ-Free World.  I jerk off to this.  He'll roll in in a bubble.  Some guy holds up his library card. 
[03:16:30]  What's that for?  I'd check it off.  I'd check it off.  Can you hold both of the doors open  so my bubble can fit into the store?  You shake Anthony's world up  and snow comes out of the top of it.  Yeah.  Let's go to Matt in Connecticut.  Matt.  Oh.  Matt.  Oh, Matt.  Matt, hey.  Hey.  Anthony.  Hey, were those books that stimulated you  or were they drawings on a cave wall?  Oh, come on.  Was that the same? 
[03:17:00]  No.  Not come on.  Chris.  You've crashed.  Go ahead, Chris.  Hey, Alpy, can you please chew your food?  I am doing my food.  A little away from the microphone, please?  The mic's right in front of his mouth.  He's got to talk.  He's a radio host.  How is he supposed to?  How is Muzzy?  Well, you know, let little Jimmy speak.  He could have eaten your lunch  while Jimmy was doing his riff for two hours.  What riff?  What riff, dude?  I was trying to...  I don't remember.  Jimmy, can you repeat it, please? 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Punching out, boys.  This is the most fucking retarded show ever.  No, it's not.  We weren't supposed to work today.  Yep.  This is fucking retarded.  Is that a...  Darth chicken. 
[03:18:00]  Jimmy.  Bobby keeps gagging.  Jimmy is grimming.  Opie, I'm just excited because the weekend's coming.  Take care of our guests and let them be part of the show without having to run out.  But you get it over here, too.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Oh, my God.  Don't blow it over here.  What the fuck are you doing?  I don't want it over here.  Get rid of my soul.  He's got it.  Holy shit.  Tell him to put his legs down.  He's got his legs up like he's giving birth to a...  Get it that way. 
[03:18:30]  I got to fight a battle now.  Hey, not on my food.  If it stops you from chewing...  Yeah, let me see.  All right.  Matt.  Let's move it that way.  Yeah.  What's up, boys?  All right.  That stuff stinks.  Matt.  Oh, yeah.  Stuff coming out of your ass.  Matt.  Matt.  Do you hear me?  Yes.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  When I first discovered jacking off, I used to go over to my grandparents' house in the  back bathroom to the garage.  We used to keep the JCPenney catalogs and whack off to the models in there.  Why didn't you just wait until your grandmother fell asleep and put your face in her ass? 
[03:19:00]  Well, that was option number two.  Hey.  See you, boys.  I just wanted to jack in the daytime.  While she laid there and had nightmares about being laid down at the bottom of the  steps.  That's what old people dream of.  Like, their nightmares have nothing to do with monsters or the devil.  It's just laying at the bottom of the steps.  What is it?  With a pretzel stick thigh just broken.  At around 9.15 a.m.  And nobody's coming home.  Mike in Virginia.  Mike. 
[03:19:30]  Hello.  Mr. Norton?  Yes, Mike.  Could you just say hello?  Hello.  To me.  Hi, Mike.  Hi, Mike.  Get to the point.  All right.  I'm getting to the point.  I used to jack off the pygmies in the library.  You know those books?  Those National Geographic books?  Yeah, National Geographic.  Yeah.  Please tell me what a cum cookie is.  Thank you.  We reference this a lot, and people don't get the joke.  It's the classic circle jerk. 
[03:20:00]  What?  I've never heard of the cookie or the cracker.  Well, cracker, yes.  Until Jimmy brought it up.  Well, my cum cookie I actually got from a girl I know.  She threatened me.  She was going to dominate me and make me cum on a cookie and eat it.  She said, give you a cum cookie.  It's not my thing, but it was...  Oh, thank God.  I'll tell you the truth.  I'm not open about this stuff.  Cross that out.  That's not my thing.  Cross that one off.  But it turned me on that she was such a perv and would think of it.  Awesome.  But did you cum on a cookie and feed it to you? 
[03:20:30]  Just the idea of doing...  That turned you on?  No.  The idea that she was so perverted that that was something she thought.  Iraq, what did you just write and give me?  He hands you...  I give you a free pass a thousand times.  I gotta call you out on this one.  Read it, Ant.  No.  Iraq, read what you wrote.  Read it, Eric.  Read this gem.  It's called Ookie Cookie.  What's the matter, Oop?  Nothing.  It was supposed to be...  Like, I was supposed to go, hey, what was that called, Jimmy? 
[03:21:00]  Ookie Cookie?  That was called Ookie Sucky.  Hmm.  You fucking oosh...  So was that.  Jesus, Ookie Sucky.  Wow.  Don't be such an ooshbag douchebag.  This is a foggy comedy road this morning, isn't it?  Look at the shitty character you just did.  I'm iron tired.  We got an eight-show late-show Sunday.  You're assies, smellsies.  Wow.  Saved you.  Oof.  Neil in Texas, what's up?  Hey, when I was in college, I met a girl that had scoliosis, and she was pretty hot. 
[03:21:30]  And I ended up taking her back to my buddy's truck and doing her in the truck, and it was  pretty good, you know, because it was kind of cramped and everything, so she could move  her spine around in place, and it worked out pretty good.  So, you know, it's not always the retards.  We have the crooked spines.  That's good.  You could do them doggy style, and they're always looking at you.  Yeah, she could, like, bend her head back up under it, lick my balls at the same time,  so it worked out. 
[03:22:00]  She was like, fuck it.  Hey, I got something else, too.  When they go to bar...  Fucking water bugs.  Huh?  They have, when they go to Barnes & Noble, they have Jack magazines in there, so tell  them that that's off-limits.  Yeah, it's got to be that stuff.  Yeah, no Jack magazines.  You've got to be creative.  It's got to be a book of the chess section.  That's right.  Well, you know, they have, like, the erotic art and stuff like that in there.  Yeah.  Tell them not to go to Clay Aiken CDs, either.  They cannot do that.  Wait, what did you say?  Who's CDs?  They cannot go to the Clay Aiken CDs. 
[03:22:30]  Who is...  Tell them those are off-limits.  Who's Clay Aiken?  Is that pottery?  What?  We didn't hear you.  What did you say?  Is he an artist or something?  I'm not to jack off to the Clay Aiken CDs.  Who's Clay Aiken?  Is he a photographer or something?  Why would Clay Aiken jerk off?  Yeah.  Dude, what do you mean?  Punching out.  Jesus.  All right, listen.  Let's go to the dugout, Doug.  This guy's not getting away without a crash.  He said that same bad joke three fucking times.  Did you think it was a bad joke? 
[03:23:00]  Stupid ass.  I thought it was pretty good, actually.  I almost told you who Clay Aiken was.  I know.  I saw it.  You saw it?  Yeah.  You're almost a bit runer.  Dugout, Doug!  I'm trying to die.  That fucking laughs.  I tell you, when I jerk off, I love to jerk off looking at the hottest girl on Paltaw competition  on FullBlownAids.com.  Ah.  Final four right now, guys. 
[03:23:30]  We're down to Hoody McBoob, XOXO05, a girl, and, uh, oh, shit.  Who's the fourth?  Kara from MySpace.  All right.  And, uh, Travis, Travis, unfortunately, did not make the cut, but, uh, we upgraded our  servers, so you guys might be able to get on there today.  All right.  I say Kara from MySpace wins.  I say the XOXO.  I still don't have a screen name or password for... 
[03:24:00]  Kara.  Full-blown name.  Kara wins.  I would vote for Kara.  You got my password?  You got it.  Well, all the girls are good-looking, but I would vote for you.  I don't know, guys.  You haven't taken a look at a girl.  You're very good-looking.  Kara McBoob is...  Yeah, yeah.  Kara McBoob was the, uh, first girl that did the, uh, Paltalk Gets Within My Pants, if  you remember.  Yeah, we loved the first.  Yeah, and the Model T was the first, uh, mass-produced car.  Exactly.  Would you drive it around these days?  No.  That's right.  Exactly.  And the Negro was the first forklift.  Jesus.  I'll be honest with you.  She's a, she's a story of accomplishment from the show. 
[03:24:30]  She, uh, didn't like the smashing she got from you guys during the first Gets Within My  Pants, and has dropped some major...  Now let us stop holding a grudge.  And she looks great.  She looks great in the top four of the hottest girl on Paltalk competition.  Well, I gotta, you know, you know why I'm saying Kara also?  Kara has, uh, gone to the two-camera shoot.  Keep going.  She has, uh...  On the Paltalk, yeah.  Yeah, she has the camera on her face, the camera on her body, and then she's constantly 
[03:25:00]  drinking and smoking.  Yeah.  Which kind of, I think, puts her over the top.  Do you like drinking and smoking?  No, I really don't.  But there's something when girls are doing it like that.  I would want to, like, be with a girl that's all hammered and smoking.  Believe me, I was married to one.  It ain't fun.  But, uh, when, when they're on Paltalk and she's just chugging her beers and smoking  her cigarettes, there's just something about it.  I think she should win.  Really?  Because...  Unfortunately, uh, Travis didn't make the cut into the final four.  We're very sorry about that, Travis, but he got a lot of votes. 
[03:25:30]  There's something not hot about a girl sipping club soda with a nicotine patch on her arm,  okay, Bob?  I'm saying the smoking and drinking kind of adds to something, you know.  That's that Long Island in you, that friggin' Guinea Long Island.  I like the fuckin' hair, I want a fuckin' hair teased up two feet high.  I want a meter down in Bayshore.  There's something about a girl hitting a jig.  I want a, I want a chick with fuckin' French manicure, sucking on a brewski.  How you doin'?  Eh?  Nails like fuckin' talons. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, talons.  It feels like on your keck.  Scratch my back.  Right there, right there, right there, right there, right there.  Up, up, up, up, up, up, up.  All right there, Doug.  Bye, Doug.  We're all right.  When's the contest over and what do they win?  The contest ends next Wednesday.  Don't get nothing in like it.  Hey, Doug.  Actually, we had a lot of people donate prizes, and I believe our very own Bob Kelly was going  to send us some things.  Oh, dude, I got to send that to you.  I'll send it today.  You never emailed me the address, though.  I did. 
[03:26:30]  I don't think you sent me that.  Always a problem, isn't there, Bob?  Hey, can you do me a favor?  Can you send it to my MySpace so I definitely get it?  Because I'm having an email problem.  I've never heard of my MySpace.  What's your MySpace?  No, no, no.  Account.  Oh, it's just MySpace?  It's MySpace.  Shut your face.  MySpace slash Robert.  Anthony Cumia.  C-U-M-I-A.  MySpace slash Robert.  Jim Norton.  Bobby Kelly.  MySpace.  Ew.  MySpace.  R. Kelly.  R. Kelly.  Robert Kelly Live.  Ow. 
[03:27:00]  Ooh.  And actually, we have a couple hundred dollars worth of prizes, and they're all basically  competing for the first prize, which is an actual clone of my penis as a dildo.  Ugh.  Really?  Yeah.  You put the batteries in it, and it just fucking babbles out of a hole.  And then it punches you in the face.  Just talks.  All right.  Just calls other radio hosts nonstop for days.  Yeah.  It's a fucking...  It's a dildo with a redial option. 
[03:27:30]  A dildo with a username and a password.  So it's fullblownage.com, the contest they're having for hottest pal truck.  They're all hot, pal truck.  They're all fucking hot.  But I would have to go with Kara.  And you put my dates up there, too, Doug, huh?  He's gone.  All right, listen.  All right, listen.  Next week, when the show returns...  You're kidding.  ...back to normal, we're going to have Kevin Smith on next week.  Otto and George...  Kevin Smith.  ...coming back again.  Good.  Wow, really?  Bill Burr and Billy Connolly, who just killed for us.  He's great, man.  Billy Connolly's funny. 
[03:28:00]  I want to go see his show, and I want to go see Lee Evans, who came in, who was supposed  to be a really great stand-up, man.  I've only seen a couple minutes of him, but I want to go see Lee's show.  Let's go.  Did you say Kevin Smith?  Yeah, the director.  He's a buddy.  He comes to the hangs.  Really?  I got him for the show.  So when we're back to normal, that's what's going to happen next week.  We've got Bob Kelly in studio.  We're going to do one more break and get the hell out of here for the long weekend.  You haven't seen any of those? 
[03:28:30]  No, I've never seen 3D.  I've never seen a 3D good 3D.  3D's really good now.  You go to like Disney, or you go to...  Never been to Disney.  Universal Studios.  Never been.  They got it down in Florida, and you see a Determinator.  And I swear, it looks like the shit is coming right at you, and something's hover right  in front of your face, and it seems like it's right there. 
[03:29:00]  They've gotten pretty good with that 3D shit.  You still have to wear the stupid cardboard glasses?  Yeah, you've got to wear the stupid glasses, but...  They haven't made them into plastic yet?  Like cool, like oak leaves?  It's not the red and the blue anymore.  It's just like sunglasses.  They look like sunglasses.  Are they cardboard?  No, they're plastic.  Oh, they've got plastic ones.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  And then you've got to take them off and put them in a big bin when you leave so they  can sterilize them for the next people coming through, I'm sure.  Did that bug you?  That bugged me, because all I thought of when I put them on is Rich Voss's stinky ear cyst, 
[03:29:30]  and how one of the glasses probably got somebody's ear cysts.  And some of the juice actually popped out.  And the juice was on there.  Right.  And then you get other people that are waiting on line to go in.  Please wait behind the line until the doors open and the show starts.  And people are standing there with the glasses, the ear part in their mouth, chewing on it.  And it has to be a billion people have worn those glasses before you stick it in your fucking mouth.  Would you do that? 
[03:30:00]  Would you suck the ear into this?  No.  You wouldn't put the ear at the end of the right where the ear goes right into your mouth?  I wouldn't suck on something if it came out of a surgeon's fucking, whatever they call it.  How about if it came out of the bottom of my ball bag?  There's a name for it.  Sanitizer.  No, but there's a name for it.  Say sanitizer again and watch this sail off your head.  Sanitizer.  Oh.  Now you gotta do it.  Now you gotta do it.  Now you gotta do it.  Oh, what's the world coming to? 
[03:30:30]  You talk tough, you don't fucking do it, huh?  You talk tough.  Come on, you're gonna make me think what I fucking did, huh?  Come on, do it, do it.  It's like the best Jeff Norris impression I've ever heard.  What?  Bob Kelly.  I'll throw something off your fat head.  Well, thank you.  Uh-huh.  I don't fight ex-fat dudes.  Ex.  He's lost a lot of weight.  He looks good.  Shut up.  What?  You're a fat dude.  I'm not a fat dude.  Jeez. 
[03:31:00]  Bob talks like he has abs.  I don't talk like I have abs, but I don't.  I'm not fat.  Really?  No, I'm not fat.  I'm chunky.  Shut up.  There's a difference.  You're not fat when compared with a blue whale.  Dude, you're not fucking...  I don't like the fact that you lost weight and you somehow think you're in shape.  You're not in shape.  You're A-shape.  You'll never, ever be in shape.  You'll always just be mushy, kinda.  I don't like the fact that when you're looking at me, there's a big fold in your neck.  I don't like the fact...  Shut your face. 
[03:31:30]  You're jealous.  Middle of the book neck.  You're jealous that I have a neck.  You friggin' knee chin.  It's not a neck.  It's a thigh under your chin.  I don't like the fact that you look like a thumb puppet.  Oh my God.  They are throwing some blows.  And I don't like the fact that you have a goatee just so people know where your fat neck  and head ends and your chest begins.  Really?  Wordy?  A little wordy.  You want to keep going?  A little wordy.  It was a little wordy. 
[03:32:00]  Actually, we worked out together a couple weeks ago.  We certainly did.  I really disgusted Jim Norwood.  It's true.  And they made me pay for the fucking exercise bike you broke.  Hey, Derek in Canada wants to fix the other guy's bad colonic joke.  Derek.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, Derek.  Good luck.  Welcome to the program.  Hi, Derek.  Hey, it's first time caller.  It's kind of cool.  No one cares, Derek.  Get to it.  Do we really give a shit?  It's your first time?  Yeah, exactly.  What led up to this?  Shit, Dick.  Tell the joke.  You understand, though.  These callers call in, and they're used to other radio shows.  First time caller. 
[03:32:30]  Well, welcome.  Yeah.  And you guys are like, we don't give a fuck.  Are you a ditto head?  Well, go fuck yourself.  We apologize, dude.  It's kind of hard to come on this show.  Oh, give a shit.  All right, let's do it again.  You're supposed to say first time.  How's it going?  Hey, what's up?  What's up, Derek?  I just wanted to fix that guy.  He's a bad colonic joke there.  He could have fixed it really easily.  Are you a first time caller?  First time, long time.  Are you a first time caller?  Yeah.  Cool.  Good luck.  Welcome aboard.  Long time listener? 
[03:33:00]  Just probably about two months.  I got XM book two months ago.  Instead of...  Thanks for the support.  Instead of wah-wah, I do this.  Heh-heh.  Works just as well.  Go ahead.  I'm going to fix that bad joke there.  It was really easy for that guy to fix.  All I had to say was instead of hooking it up to Eric's tip, he could have said,  hook it up to Eric's dick.  There's nothing more funny than a little seminal flush.  You know what else you should fix?  Oh, wow.  Hold on.  Did you hear the end of that one? 
[03:33:30]  He just trumped the other guy.  You know what else you should fix?  How about fixing the bridge of your mouth with a shotgun?  That dude was awful.  I honestly didn't think I was going to get a car crash on that one, but hey.  That's a fucking jumbo jet hitting a mountainside.  His dumb Canadian accent is annoying me.  You know how he could have fixed that colonic joke?  If he would have said, hook it up to his penis.  Hey, I get a St. Paulie's, eh? 
[03:34:00]  Nothing's funnier than a little seminal drip.  Yes, everything's funnier than that.  A little seminal drip.  Hey, they should have put it into a bottle of Molson Golden.  We love Canada, by the way.  We certainly do, you bunch of moose fuckers.  Jeff in Ohio, Jeff.  Hey, guys, love the show.  Back to the U.S. of A, Jeff.  Thank you, and we care what you are.  Hey, I wanted to get Jimmy's perspective.  I really appreciate his comedic sense.  All right, I'll give you my perspective. 
[03:34:30]  This is a little segment I do.  I just wanted to get your perspective on this.  There's a girl that I've been banging, and...  Let me give you my answer right now.  Go ahead.  Yeah?  I've been banging this chick, and I tell my buddies that I call her my dumpster fuck.  And the reason why is because I usually get trashed, and then I throw it in her.  So what perspective would you like?  Yeah.  How bad that joke was?  Yeah.  You know something?  I'm not even going to give you a car crash.  Oh, you mean, like, comedic? 
[03:35:00]  I think you meant on the girl.  You mean on the joke?  The joke itself, yeah.  Well, the thing about it that I like is that it had...  The reason it was a hidden joke is because it had none of the qualities that normally make something a joke,  which would be, like, humor value or interest to people who are hearing it.  No car crash.  Go ahead.  Go on.  Please, please, I'll pardon you.  Oh, wow.  That rarely happens.  That's right.  I'll pardon you.  You left a dirty ring around this studio, and we let you go.  I'm just going to let him get far enough away and then shoot him in the back.  He did kill him, didn't he?  Yes, he did.  John in Detroit.  Hey, kids. 
[03:35:30]  I'd like to help out Professor Anthony.  Yes.  It's autoclave.  Autoclave.  That's what a doctor uses to clean his tool.  And he's going to put it in his mouth.  An autoclave.  Thank you, sir.  Ohio's a dickhead.  Hey.  I had a stick clave.  I'm amazed, Anthony.  I almost knew that.  I was trying so hard, but I couldn't remember.  It's something you take to kind of disinfect everything.  Why would you ever have to say that?  That's what it is, though.  The autoclave. 
[03:36:00]  I know that because what he said earlier.  It's something that wasn't in that fucking place that she shoved that hose up your ass.  Holy shit.  An autoclave.  Something that sterilizes something.  That's right.  I didn't know.  I got to get that number from you.  I want to call and just see if it's a dirty place.  I want to see.  I had to do an air conditioning job once in a place that does the fucking rectal exams with the big pipe.  I don't know.  The big colonoscopy.  And I had to do air conditioning work in the actual office.  So I walk in there with my ladder and my tools, and I'm going to pop a ceiling tile. 
[03:36:30]  And I look in the corner, and like in science fiction movies when there's aliens and the big glass drum, there was the pipe sitting there in this thing of water.  Just waiting for its next victim.  Just waiting.  And I'm looking going, oh, my dear sweet Jesus Christ.  There is no way I ever want that up my ass.  Was it bad that while she was actually doing it, her roommate actually excused to actually walk through the room to use the bathroom?  See, that's not...  Why did she just get on the table and shit like you were? 
[03:37:00]  She didn't even have a bathroom in that place.  She's like, excuse me one second.  Just starts making out with you.  Wait, there was two girls?  I tell you, I was...  I really...  Ugh.  Dude, I want the number of that place.  I was fighting not getting...  There's something wrong that I've been overweight.  Yeah.  That my penis has a...  How do I say this?  Just say it.  Say it.  It's like an innie.  Yeah.  How did you know?  You showed me.  It's fucking...  You're getting cock fat.  It's like puke fat. 
[03:37:30]  Wait, he showed you, Jimmy?  Yeah, he showed me.  It was awful.  Well, no.  I didn't really...  Shut up.  You're fucking...  It looked like a little...  It looked like one of those little fucking...  A party Frank.  Oh, a little cocktail Frank.  Shut up, pigs in a blanket dick.  Well, I mean, it grows...  Do you have a fatty...  Do you have a fatty pubis?  Is that what it is?  A fatty pubis?  And it's swallowing up?  I have a nice fat bush fat.  I, uh...  No, it's...  What happened is I gained a little weight in my...  The blood doesn't go...  It fills up. 
[03:38:00]  When it fills up, it's...  Maybe on another planet.  It's regulous.  But the fat around the area is...  Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  It's like when a tree...  Hang on, fucking Anthony.  I said you gained a little weight.  I said maybe on another planet.  He was saying a little weight.  He was saying that...  I get what he's fucking saying.  He was saying on the moon it's a little weight.  As they wanted it, it was stepped on.  It was pretty funny.  You're a cocksucker.  Oh, Jay, thanks.  Go ahead.  Boy, I get one today.  Wonderful.  I smell something.  I'll feel good about myself.  You got to see it's the surrounding fatty area that's gobbling up your penis. 
[03:38:30]  Like when a tree eats a stop sign over the years.  You ever see that?  The tree goes over and swallows it.  It's the fat from around your dick.  It's your bush fat.  It's now pushing up.  It's called your bush fat.  Bush fat.  That's the technical jargon.  Right where all the hair is, it's called bush fat.  Doctor talk.  It's actually in the...  Why am I smelling fart?  Why do you think?  Because ass lips over here...  By the way, no bonus show today because Jimmy's farting.  That's right.  Blame it on Jimmy.  No, blame it on me.  I'll take full credit.  No bonus show.  Blame it on Jimmy when he's at the Stress Factory. 
[03:39:00]  We didn't do a bonus show on Friday.  That's right, you ingrates.  That's right.  Because this is dreck.  You don't need more of it.  Let's go to Drew in Virginia Beach.  Drew.  Fatty pubis.  That should be your stage name.  Happy birthday, Bob.  Fatty pubis.  Fatty pubis.  Ladies and gentlemen, making his first Letterman appearance.  Fatty pubis.  Phil is saying that Bob Kelly's cock looks like a balding Chinese guy ducking into reeds.  Drew.  That's funny with the pubic hair.  The greatest high I ever had in my life was going for a colonoscopy. 
[03:39:30]  There is nothing like the mix of drugs that they give you before you go in for that.  I swear to God, I'll go in every week if I could get that high again.  What kind of drugs do you take for that?  Some poppers?  I have no idea, but I just know that it's good.  A few bikini teenies?  I want that number, Bob.  What do you want?  You want to go to this lady?  Happy birthday, Bob.  I want to call.  I don't know.  You want to go and have something shoved in your ass because you'll completely use it  as a sexual thing.  No.  You know what? 
[03:40:00]  And it's weird because she basically had a towel, just a towel, a yellow towel over my  genitals.  A few weeks ago.  Ugh.  A yellow towel over your genitals.  Over my genitals and it kept slipping down.  Because there's nothing to hold it up for.  Slipping down the pubis.  It wasn't a towel, it was a washcloth.  Old sand dune cock.  I'm like fucking, Ope is really kicking it in high gear with fucking 10 seconds left  of the show.  So wait, what happened?  Cock sucker.  You had a little thing covering your arm. 
[03:40:30]  You're all going to remember the last jokes.  I'm gearing up now.  I'm out.  You had a little thing.  He's really going on vacation already.  So what happened?  You had something covering your cock?  It kept slipping down?  It kept slipping down and she kept, I was on my side, so I had my knees kind of  up in my chest or in my stomach as you're probably going to say.  And you know, I felt her holding whatever was in my ass and then she put me up on my  back.  So I was on my back with my knees folded and the towel kept slipping down then and she 
[03:41:00]  kept picking it up and it kept like slipping down to my cock.  It can't stay on your thighs because your thighs are up in the air.  Right.  So it kept slipping down and slipping down to my cock and then she kept having to bring  it back up over my knees.  How about just pulling it between your thighs to cover up that area?  I know.  That's sexual though.  She was covering it, right?  It wasn't sexual, but it kept slipping down.  So it was kind of like, I know she kept seeing my sack.  You were at a fucking massage pod.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[03:41:30]  Even for money, she couldn't look at that thing.  She was, it was, it was, it was, whatever.  Don't fuck you, dude.  I want to see it.  You want to see my dick?  I want to see it.  Yeah, this is not even a homosexual.  I could suck it.  It wouldn't be a gay act.  It's not, I get a nice size dick.  Because it's got to be a cock.  Dude, you've seen my, I do that.  We've banged a chick together.  Whatever that thing you're carrying now, I want to put compound W on it.  Dude, I got a nice size cock.  You've seen my dick.  Yeah, no, you do.  You do.  You fucking banged.  Under a microscope.  Dude, we've banged a door together. 
[03:42:00]  You've seen my dick.  It's not a bad cock.  It looks like a virus.  Jimmy was fucking her, and she was swatting something away from her face.  But Bob's cock, actually, when he takes it out now, it actually goes,  My dick goes,  Listen.  My cock, I got a, Jay Moore says it.  I got a grower, not a shower.  Oh, shut up.  You have neither.  Let's go to Beth.  Neither.  Beth.  What, Hawk? 
[03:42:30]  Beth.  Oh, we got a girl.  Beth.  Hawk, what, Hawk says it.  What?  What?  E-Rock, what?  Go.  What's that, E-Rock?  Say it.  No, you say it.  You have to.  It's a void.  Nothing there.  A void?  Yeah.  You're right there.  Absolutely.  You mean that part of the studio?  I bring nothing to the table.  Thank you.  I bring nothing to the table.  I bring nothing to the table.  You know what nothing is?  Nothing is between his ears.  A void.  I bring nothing to the table.  Thank you for saving me, E-Rock.  Hey, uh, Beth, you there?  Yeah.  Go ahead, Bethy.  What's your problem? 
[03:43:00]  What's up, Beth?  Beth.  Yeah, I wanted to play the What's in My Pants game.  Why has it come to this?  Well, the pictures are being handed out.  Yeah, you might be able to play.  All right.  Shit, yeah.  I'm going to guess Lacks, you live in two stool softeners.  All right, well.  She's cute.  Where are you from, Beth?  Finally, a thin one.  Can I see you?  I'm from North Carolina.  Oh, they're very sexy, actually.  North Carolina.  If that porch doesn't say North Carolina.  Yeah.  Wow.  Who took that? 
[03:43:30]  Your father?  Is that a car that doesn't run right behind you?  Um, no.  Yeah, it does run, but it wasn't mine.  Are there wheels underneath the porch?  That's the worst porch ever.  That's awful.  Are you all right?  Jesus.  Yeah, how are you doing over there?  I'm doing good.  How are you all?  You doing all right?  What do you do for a living?  Obviously nothing.  Working at Roses.  What's Roses?  It's either a strip club or a diner.  Just a retail store. 
[03:44:00]  Retail store?  Yeah.  Does somebody have a gun to your head right now?  Huh?  She's kind of a little timid, right?  We're going to go down to Roses.  I've got to get me some furniture.  What do they sell, like everything down there?  Yeah, pretty much.  You fucking call them and play this goddamn game.  It's like a poor man's Walmart, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's play the game, baby.  Jesus Christ.  What?  You got a boyfriend?  Yeah.  Yeah?  He...  How old a gal are you?  Nineteen. 
[03:44:30]  Nineteen?  How old am I?  Yeah.  Nineteen.  You lost your virginity at twelve, right?  No.  Just assuming.  Two.  Geography.  How old were you?  Fourteen.  All right.  Are you a Baptist?  Daddy?  Who was it?  Uncle?  No.  Cousin?  At fourteen.  How old was he?  Thirty-two, right?  Fifty-seven.  No.  Fourteen.  We went to school together.  Fourteen also?  Fifteen, maybe there was.  You're blowing apart every stereotype I have of the South and your picture. 
[03:45:00]  Get out of here, Hawk.  Well, you want to play a guess what's in my pants?  Where are you?  I mean, are you home?  In Chapel Hill.  Yes, I'm home.  You're home.  You're in your house.  Are you alone at home?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Doors locked.  How fast are you driving?  Huh?  She's in her house.  Are you in your bedroom?  Yeah.  I stole Bob's joke.  What do you have up on the walls?  Redid my joke.  Some Guns N' Roses pictures and Jack Daniels. 
[03:45:30]  Wine bottles.  Jack Daniels and Guns N' Roses.  And what about your bedspread?  Is it the same one you've had since you were fourteen?  No.  No?  Do you have a buck knife?  No.  All right.  I'm just trying to get to know you a little bit.  All right.  Are you nude?  Kind of.  Kind of.  Not fully.  What's off?  What do you have on besides, obviously, a hockey helmet?  Got a t-shirt on.  It's just to slow away a life down there.  It doesn't have...  It's not a...  Are you a fan...  Of their intelligence. 
[03:46:00]  Are you a fan of this show, Angel?  A fan?  Yes.  Okay.  I'm sorry I said that.  Good.  How long have you been listening?  About a month.  What's my name?  Yours?  Yeah.  I believe you're Opie.  That's right.  And who are the other guys in studio?  And who am I?  Are you?  Yeah.  Oh, Lord.  Close enough.  He's the Lord.  I am the Lord.  Everybody's the Lord sometimes now.  Oh.  All right. 
[03:46:30]  So, wait.  Okay, you had Opie.  And who else?  Um, there's Anthony and little Jimmy.  Little Jimmy.  Of course.  Little Jimmy.  I won an award, you know.  I'm the sweetest boy in studio.  No, he isn't.  I am.  Okay, we need to, um...  No.  ...play the song, right?  Right?  All right.  We need to play the song. 
[03:47:00]  What's the matter?  Dude, dude, dude.  Don't interrupt this song.  Never pay attention to Jimmy.  She's a bore.  What?  No, she's not.  She's great.  It doesn't matter.  She's got to rub the phone on her twat.  Yeah, dude.  She's got a cunt, doesn't she?  I hope so.  She's a fucking bore.  She's a bore.  She's shy.  It's her first time.  Sweetie, have you been on the radio before?  No.  Okay, that would explain why you're so boring and horrible.  What do you want?  No, come on.  You want stimulating conversation? 
[03:47:30]  Exactly.  Yeah, she's going to rub a phone on her twat.  Yeah, exactly.  Just run through it quick, get it over with.  We're not going to get Mensa members playing this game.  Yeah.  Is this the point where her father is right now?  No, don't say that at all.  She really is.  He's in the room.  All right.  Oh, Jesus, Jimmy.  All right, let's play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  I only got something else.  Okay, okay.  Beth, you know how the game is played? 
[03:48:00]  Um, what you got to do is you got to take your panties and your pants off.  Not in that order.  That would be a little tough.  Take your pants and your panties off.  Are they off?  Yeah.  Where are you?  Sitting down on your bed?  Standing up?  What are you doing?  I'm laying down.  Laying down.  Very good.  Now, take the phone.  Uh-huh.  Uh, excuse me?  Ask your father to hold the phone.  No, don't be nice to her now.  I'm just sorry, sweetheart.  We're just teasing you.  Yeah, laying down is very good because then you get a lot more coverage. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah.  Cool.  Do you have things in your room that maybe you use when guys aren't available?  Maybe, but I'm not supposed to tell that stuff.  You got a vibrator?  You own a vibrator?  No.  No?  Yeah, you do.  It's in that drawer.  Use the bedpost.  Yeah.  Can you get this over?  She uses a cake mixer.  Jesus.  All right.  Okay.  Take the phone.  My limo's outside.  Come on.  Take the phone.  And rub it up and down on your most intimate of area. 
[03:49:00]  All right.  Okay.  Let's listen.  All right.  Oh, wow.  That's very...  Okay.  Now, side to side, please.  Okay.  Okay.  Listen.  Okay, now in a circular fashion, slow circles over the whole area.  Are you opening up a bag of Doritos?  That's fucking funny.  Let me hear. 
[03:49:30]  I know.  These guys don't give me anything when I...  Slow circles all around the whole area.  Sick.  All around the whole area?  Or the area's whole.  Ha ha.  Nothing to work.  Okay, I'm going to say there are four choices here.  One is the full triangle.  The other one is the landing strip.  The other one is the Hitler mustache.  The other one is the wood floor, which is clean shaven.  Don't say anything until we ask you what's in your pants.  Until everybody guesses, I am going to say a full triangle.  Opie?  Full triangle.  Full triangle.  I'm going to guess. 
[03:50:00]  Hitler mustache.  Hitler mustache.  He has a landing strip.  Landing strip.  Full triangle.  Full triangle.  Beth, what is in your pants?  Um, landing strip.  Landing strip.  Hey, there we go.  Who won?  Me, of course.  Jimmy Norton.  Jesus Christ, how did Jimmy win?  I fucking know all about plusology.  And look at what Jimmy gets.  Jimmy gets a trophy for that.  I already have one.  You know what my trophy is?  Don't care.  I'm the sweetest boy I've stood there.  But I was a little boy.  I also won Boy Most Likely to Brighten Your Day. 
[03:50:30]  No, you didn't.  And no, you can't.  And Boy Who Smile Most Resembles a Rainbow.  Does it?  The Wilkerson boy was scheduled to win, but there was a mysterious gas fire in his room  the day before.  You killed him.  He was alive, but he wasn't smiling much.  Wow, Beth, that was great.  Jesus Christ.  Good job, baby.  Thank you very much.  You're welcome.  Flow stopper. 
[03:51:00]  Take care, baby.  You too.  Hey, Beth.  Yeah.  What exactly is it you like about the show?  Um, just funny as hell.  Wow.  Is that a picture of your boyfriend on your MySpace?  Yeah.  He fits in perfect there, too.  I must say.  Jesus Christ.  I didn't know you were going out with Bo Bice.  It is definitely a Bo Bice thing.  He hates that shit.  Oh, he must.  That's why he keeps his hair and beard exactly like him.  Yeah.  You're a nice girl.  You want to do anything else for us? 
[03:51:30]  Wow.  You want to maybe diddle or?  Do you have a big clit?  No.  Is there anything else you want to do?  Because there's still 15 people listening to us.  Could be a couple more than that.  That was kind of crappy.  Yeah.  Just 15?  No.  Oh.  I liked it.  I'm going to rub a coffee cup on my bush fat.  Please don't. 
[03:52:00]  Or if you do, make a Jimmy's coffee cup.  Anthony said, please don't, and he meant it.  Why not?  It's a coffee pot.  Wow, Beth.  That was great.  Fantastic.  Thank you very much, Beth, for being a fan of the show and playing.  Appreciate it, baby.  You're welcome.  Goodbye.  You guys are really on vacation.  Oh, vacation mode is...  Look at you guys.  No, I got some material I want to cover.  Don't be involved.  No, you don't.  Come to the Stress Factory and hang out and make some friends.  Yes.  You still got tickets for the Sunday Late Show, right, Jimmy? 
[03:52:30]  Stress Factory?  Yeah, about 50 left.  You guys going to come see me?  We had a new promo and everything we didn't play.  Me and Steve worked for an hour on that yesterday.  I'm sorry.  Homo?  What do you got, Bobby?  I'm going to be at the Caroline's Comedy Club, June 29th to July 2nd.  Way to plug it a month early.  No shit.  I'm going to get my gum in your face.  Jesus.  What are you doing in November?  I actually got a Brea improv next week.  All right, great.  I'm going to be at the restaurant all this weekend.  FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue in Huntington. 
[03:53:00]  What's that?  Thanks for listening to the show.  I'm kidding.  It's my restaurant with my brother.  Can you put our new promo on the rotation?  I'll be there all weekend.  Oh, please.  We'll see you Tuesday.  Tuesday.  Tuesday.  Herk.  Jerk.  Herk.  Jerk.  Herk.  Jerk.  Ben Sparks is herky jerky.  Wave his arms around like he's herky jerky.  Compulsing on the ground because he's herky jerky.  You know that he don't give a fuck.  He's herky jerky.  Don't mistake him for a bum.  O.T.ing on some drugs.  He's moving all around because Ben Sparks is what he does. 
[03:53:30]  He's into gossiping because he needs to know the buzz.  And giggling like a girl motherfucker just because.  He's a man about town.  Find it parties on the street.  Unless he's had some crazy instincts for she to eat.  Then here comes Gravy Leg.  Better move out the way.  He'll be going through a pound of toilet paper in a day.  And looking at his hair is going to make you stop and think.  Did he wipe it on the floor after someone spilled a drink?  If you watch how he moves, you'll be flicking.  He's smoking a crack.  Herky jerky on the phone.  Smaller than a tic-tac in studio.  He'll be yawning during all of his shows. 
[03:54:00]  Because all night he's been chatting about Tom Brady doing flow.  Back and bossing them drunk.  So tell you Ben's we can fix her.  Because Ben heard Kurt Schilling had sex with his sister.  Ben's mule is scary, man.  He's got Superman jugs.  His jeans are looking mean like a cancerous lump.  Now Ben is rave.  Yelling at Jim.  Yelling at Oak.  Dude, relax.  Just concentrate on doing a fucking show.  That's crazy insane.  That's crazy, crazy insane.  So dude, did I tell you about Tom Brady doing balls?  This bitch is back.  It was fucking great.  We're all in a fucking club drinking fucking coffee.  It would be like my new hairstyle.  It's called the Hurricaniac.  I hope you're so fucking yawning.  I didn't have any sleep. 
[03:54:30]  I was out looking at Bono under the fucking bridge.  It was fucking crazy insane.  It's not just crazy insane.  It's not just everybody was there.  Anyway, so I walked in, and I was like, oh no.  And I'm like, at first, I was like, oh there's no music.  There's like some cheese laying house.  And my friend saw it with them, K-Rock.  And we're in there.  And so I start cranking up, you know, his jaw a little bit.  Whoa, there's a baby that lives downstairs.  The Anthony Show. </pre>
