<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a discussion about Jim Norton's exclusion from a Jay Leno news correspondent article.  This led to a call from Bobby Bigrigger, referencing previous show material, specifically the terms "fistible" and "kickables."  The conversation then took a somber turn with the tragic discussion of a woman's drunk driving accident on the Taconic Parkway, resulting in multiple deaths. The hosts heavily criticized the woman's attorney, Dominic Barbara, for his perceived self-promotional behavior and laughter during media interviews about the case.  They then shifted to speculating about Paul Abdul's firing from American Idol, claiming to have predicted it and revealing a fabricated rumor about her having an impacted colon.  The discussion turned to the George Sardini shooting at a women's gym, analyzing his online writings that detailed his loneliness, hatred of women, and meticulous planning of the attack.  The hosts questioned his motivations and the lack of intervention despite his online pronouncements, even discussing why he didn't use prostitutes instead. A caller noted Sardini's negative views on Obama and the liberal media. The segment concluded with a return to Jim Norton's omission from the article and a comparison of Opie's sunset-themed tweets to Anthony's videos showcasing gun-related activities, including a recent shooting trip with Keith and videos of him shooting watermelons with a .50 caliber handgun.

The show continued with Anthony describing his own watermelon-shooting videos, using various firearms, and discussing an upcoming shooting trip. This transitioned into a discussion of Louis C.K.'s drunk tweeting from a plane, followed by a debate on Nick Cannon and Nas's "Eat That Watermelon" video, questioning whether it was satire or buffoonery.  They compared a Twisted Sister song to one written by Jim Norton,  mocked John Sterling's exaggerated Yankee home run calls, discussed a bizarre TMZ horse-jumping-over-a-car video, Eli Manning's contract, and their opinions on UFC and Fedor Emelianenko.  The segment concluded with a dispute between E-Rock and Steve about missing audio for Nick DiPaolo, who was scheduled to appear as a guest, along with a discussion of Dr. Steve’s analysis of immediate bowel movements after eating certain burgers and the upcoming appearances of Nick DiPaolo and Sandy Cain.

A significant portion of the show focused on the escalating argument between E-Rock and Steve about the missing Nick DiPaolo audio CD, filled with insults and accusations.  E-Rock’s mosquito bites and his poorly designed Superman shirt became comedic tangents. Numerous offensive jokes were made, targeting people with Down syndrome and employing racial and gender stereotypes. The conversation shifted to perceived political correctness in television and movies, specifically the portrayal of minorities and the prevalence of "chick flicks."  Sandy Cain's upcoming appearance was mentioned, along with her past negative experiences on the show. The segment concluded with discussions about Lynette "Squeaky" Fromm's impending parole and racial representation in *Law & Order* and *First 48*,  promoting Nick DiPaolo's upcoming comedy show.

The discussion about racial and gender bias in media portrayals continued, fueled by Nick DiPaolo’s observation of the absence of the N-word in *The Sopranos* despite its depiction of Italian-American mobsters.  DiPaolo argued about a double standard, causing a heated exchange with a caller, Doug, about the influence of media on societal perceptions.  The conversation included the prevalence of White perpetrators in crime commercials and the use of the "Offender Locator" app, leading to humorous commentary.  Sandy Kane arrived late, marked by raunchy jokes and discussions about past incidents on the show, including showcasing a growth on her genitalia ("Twato").  She discussed her religious experiences, her career as a "naked cowgirl," and the hosts reacted to listener calls about DiPaolo and the show's content.

The final segment featured Sandy Kane, with Opie, Anthony, E-Rock, and Jim Norton attempting to convince her to let E-Rock smell her vagina or anus for money.  After much negotiation, she agreed for $40 to let him smell her anus; his reaction was described as disgusted.  Several interns were introduced, and Sandy proceeded to make crude and offensive comments about their appearances. She then performed a poorly-tuned song, "He Taught Me How to Love," and discussed her life in Times Square, with the segment filled with sexually explicit language, insults, and crude humor throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The O.P. and Anthony radio show, the most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  You got that right, Jay.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, fuck, that line is just one for the ages.  Yeah, that is a funny one.  The O.P. and Anthony show, Jim Norton's on his way in.  We just found that out.  That's very cool.  Me, me.  I noticed his name's not in the paper today, along with the other correspondents for the new Jay Leno show.  WTF-OMG.  Just.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:00:30]  I don't know what that's about.  He's definitely a correspondent for the new Jay Leno show.  It was in the paper yesterday, and a couple other rags picked up on the story today, and they're not mentioning little Jimmy Norton.  Well.  That's bullshit, my friend.  Bullshit.  They had better fix that lickety split pronto.  I say.  Let me say hi to Bob the Trucker.  Hi, Bob.  Hey there, Bob.  Hey, Bob.  Bobby Bigrigger, what's going on?  Bobby!  Long time, right?  Yeah.  Uh, first of all, good evening. 
[00:01:00]  No, no.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know.  Hey, listen.  Uh, I had a chance to catch the replay yesterday, and, uh, Tim Jeffries, I think he deserves line of the day.  And, uh, uh, what I learned in a new term, fistible.  Yeah.  No, I think he got, uh, full credit for that fine fistible line.  Yeah, that was a good one.  We now call, uh, mommies fistibles.  Fistibles.  Fistibles.  Yeah, if they have more than four kids, they're fistibles.  Yeah, Stephen S. from Bayshore came up with kickables for, for the midgets. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  And now Jim Jeffries has come up with fistibles, so.  Very nice.  Yeah, of course we gotta love that one.  And then some of us, and then what, the pregnant ones are punchables or something?  Because they look like punching bags?  Jesus.  Like, like fucking, like the speed bag or something?  Yeah.  Uh, we got some sick listeners.  Yes, we do.  Always have.  You know what, I don't think we should have went to that phone call.  Well, came out of the box with a lot of energy, and then Bobby Bigrigger kind of, well, you  know what it was, too. 
[00:02:00]  Slowing it down a little bit.  His buildup really sucked.  Yeah.  Hi, Bobby Bigrigger.  Hi.  Um, good evening.  Um, hi.  I thought he was just gonna punch it real nice.  No, no, no.  Just want to tell you guys, that line yesterday from Jim Jeffries, fistibles didn't get the  credit this year.  See you later, have a good show.  Instead, it was like, I was listening to the replay.  I'm a long time, you know me.  Well, first of all, let me start with this, then I'll do this, and then I'll go into this. 
[00:02:30]  Bobby Bigrigger, um, that's pretty much him stepping on the brake, jackknifing his  tractor-trailer, and, uh, closing the highway.  That's pretty much Bobby Bigrigger going the wrong way in the Taconic Parkway.  The Taconic.  Yeah, you try to say the Taconic at home.  I thought the story was horrible enough, Opie.  I thought we had reached a point in that story where the woman drove the wrong way down the  Taconic Parkway.  Killing.  They found that she's drunk.  Uh, she was stoned. 
[00:03:00]  She killed...  Everybody.  Everybody.  She basically killed everybody that was on that highway that day.  Except her son.  Except for her, her son, right.  There was, you know, nieces, and, and then innocent people.  Three guys in a car, and then three girls, and herself.  And then, and then they find out she's drunk, but the horror show doesn't end there, Opie.  Oh, no, it doesn't.  The horror show, just when you thought that story couldn't get any more horrible.  Well, I, I, I know where you're going, but really quick, what was her blood alcohol 
[00:03:30]  level again?  Uh, 0.19.  0.19, which is just way the fuck up there.  They're saying that's the equivalent of 10 vodka tonics or something.  10, uh, 10, uh, vodka, uh, drinks, yeah, and, um, pot on top of that, which, uh, wow.  Right.  So, like you said, you thought that would be the end of it, but...  Yes, I thought the horror was over until I, uh, watched the news this morning, and, um,  apparently, uh, the woman's husband, the intoxicated, now dead woman's husband, has secured none 
[00:04:00]  other than Dominic Barbara as his attorney.  Boo!  Yes.  Yes, the Dominic Barbara.  We're cakes for nothing!  Yes, the Dominic Barbara.  The publicity-seeking Dominic Barbara.  Yes.  Why on earth would he, uh, get a, uh...  Oh, I thought you were gonna...  ...a divorce attorney, yeah.  I thought you were gonna say, why on earth, if you look like such a fat fucking slob, would  you want your face on TV so much as he does? 
[00:04:30]  He loves it.  And, and you know something?  I don't know if he thinks he's in front of a jury at all times, or on TV, uh, uh, a TV  drama show, but he is acting, and so poorly and over the top, uh, that it's, it's disgraceful.  It's disgraceful to see this guy, when there's been such huge loss of life, uh, to, to then 
[00:05:00]  go on TV and do these, uh, during the interview, do these dramatic pauses that he does, and his  phony outrage at, like, you know, uh, the woman asked, do you think, uh, the husband  knew, uh, your client, you know, the husband knew that she was drinking, uh, that morning?  He goes, absolutely not!  Your honor!  Like, how dare you even ask that question? 
[00:05:30]  Why are you saying absolutely not?  God, it came out yesterday that her blood alcohol level was a 0.19.  It wasn't a guy just kind of, like, making an educated guess, looking at the tragedy,  going, well, this could only be caused by somebody with a blood alcohol level of 0.19.  They actually did, you know, uh, tests.  It's not like she was, you know, T-boned at an intersection or something, uh, driving, uh,  20 miles an hour, and then somebody said, hey, was she drunk?  Yeah.  How dare you? 
[00:06:00]  No, they found a broken vodka bottle.  Right.  They did the tests on her blood.  She had alcohol in her stomach still.  I mean, tragic, but let's be real here.  The woman, uh, obviously was a little fucked up.  Um, so now he's the attorney, and they're saying they want to exhume, exhume the body.  One of the worst words ever.  Exume.  They want to perform an exhumation.  They want to perform another autopsy after they exhume the body.  Topsy. 
[00:06:30]  Uh, to see if perhaps she had some kind of medical condition that would have driven her  to start drinking like that.  You know, I'm thinking they're probably thinking something like a brain tumor where she just  had no responsibility left in her mind or something.  Uh, this, this sounds to me like typical Dominic Barbara, um, posturing and, and, uh, let's get  the news in here.  Let's get the cameras going.  He is the, the white version of Reverend Al when it comes to publicity, but he's more 
[00:07:00]  local.  He never made it on a national platform.  No.  Well, he got a couple of national, he did.  Yeah.  He got a couple of national cases here and there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, and yeah, I mean the Joey Butterfuoco thing was big, but he hasn't had a hit since.  No, he hasn't had a hit.  He's a one hit wonder.  He's, he's hoping this is his big comeback.  He's Kaja Google.  Yeah.  He's Kaja Google.  That was his too shy, shy.  Right.  Hush.  What was, what was him?  Uh, what was he doing with the laugh thing?  Uh, oh, that was, uh, he, the, the woman, um, asks, uh, if, if she was drinking or something 
[00:07:30]  like that.  And he says, absolutely not.  And he said, as a matter of fact, the husband, his client there was driving home with the  dogs and she drove with the children because, and then he starts actually laughing.  He goes, cause she only drove 40 miles an hour until she was drunk and smashed into people 
[00:08:00]  head on and killed everybody.  He goes, he takes 40 miles an hour until, you know, the fiery crash that killed children.  What a despicable display that was to see him actually laughing. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  regardless of what he was talking about  or laughing at  he's talking about  being the lawyer for the husband  and the case  and he actually broke into laughter  when saying  she only drove 40 miles an hour  like that's something you do in front of a jury  to try to fool  a dumb fucking jury  like look there's no problem  here I remember 
[00:09:00]  I saw that laugh  I saw that laugh many times  where I wanted to run  and jump out  the fifth story window  and land on my head just to end the agony  that I saw  that laugh  we gotta get that sound clip for the show  40 miles an hour  right up until she wasn't doing 40  driving the wrong way  2 miles an hour  why is he getting involved with this 
[00:09:30]  he probably  I have no idea why  now stories are coming out  that this woman  you know  had boozy rants  on marriage  in local bars  I guess  or something  she wasn't  happy  in her marriage  apparently witnesses  are coming forward  and saying that  she would hang out  at these local bars  and I heard this on  1010 wins  that's my source  this morning  that she would hang out  at local bars  in her area  and just bitch about  the marriage  and how much it sucks 
[00:10:00]  and she'd get a little  you know  a little tanked up  as far as that goes  a little boozy  a little boozy  and woozy  so uh  boy  for that guy  to get  Dominic  why would you  why would you  get him  as your attorney  if you're trying  to fucking  like  maybe have some  credibility  he's kind of  the goofy  lawyer guy  and why  does the guy  have an attorney  because everyone's  suing him  because his wife  like pretty much  destroyed  all sorts of lives 
[00:10:30]  you have to go  down the line  of succession  to find  the next  living person  and he's it  so I'm sure  they want to find out  if he knew  about her drinking  if he did  is he liable  for certain things  you know  criminal  or civil  and you know  he's got Dominic  now protecting him  so he's fine  yeah there's the clip  oh my god 
[00:11:00]  he had to get  his name  is he confused  confused  pause  pause  I'm gonna go  a step further  he's suicidal  what compounds  the tragedy  toxicology test  results  he's suicidal  he's suicidal  what did he  get your first bill  yeah  what a dramatic ass  police say  she had smoked  marijuana  15 minutes 
[00:11:30]  to one hour  before driving  the wrong way  on the Taconic  State Parkway  Daniel Shuler  was one of the  last people  to see his wife  alive  did her husband  know that she'd  been drinking  that morning  here we go  listen to this  absolutely not  not only did he  not know  that she was drinking  but the reason  they separated  to go home  here we go  was separately  was he drives  the truck  with the dog  and everyone  trusts her  with the kids  because she  drives 40 miles  an hour 
[00:12:00]  40 miles an hour  she drives  40 miles an hour  right up until  the fiery death  crash  holy shit  what an ass  what is he fucking  doing  and the husband  drove with just a dog  well  I think the husband  knew  they got home fine  you know what  I'll take  me and Fido 
[00:12:30]  were going home  alright  I'm gonna  drive myself  yeah  I know what  you've been up to  so that's  a breaking story  that Barber  is involved  with something  he probably  doesn't know  much about  but more  importantly  he's on the  news  every 10 minutes  they're popping  that clip up  on the news  good for him  he loves being  on TV  good for him 
[00:13:00]  I hope  that can only  mean  that there will  only be  assistants  and people  hounding me  and he'll be  off my ass  you're almost  there right  you're almost  there  I am seeing  the light  at the end  of the tunnel  I'm almost  seeing the light  and it's  almost over  45 miles  feels good 
[00:13:30]  to laugh  he took  the dog  and she  took the  gift  because  I don't know  how to  laugh  laughing  I don't know  how you  dealt with  that shit  I don't  either  I would have  lost my  mind  opester  I don't  either  for the newbies  Dominic was  part of Ant's  divorce settlement  yes  was my  ex-wife's  attorney  during the 
[00:14:00]  divorce proceedings  for three years  or so  I had to  deal with  that  that acting  thing  the hands  the hand  motions  instead of  going apart  where he goes  they say  you'll see this  clip if you  watch the news  and see Dominic  doing the  they separated  at that point  and his hands  went apart  you know  and I saw  it when his  hands came  together  and they  should join  to the  financial  rewards 
[00:14:30]  really  I think  Dominic got  more money  than your  ex-wife  that was  smart on  her part  that's my  commentary  Anthony has  nothing to do  with that  we are  going to  exhume the  body to  see if  someone dropped  change in  the silk  now Dominic 
[00:15:00]  I'll go home  and get your  fucking  shine box  anyway  so we got  that going  on today  which is  nice  remember  yesterday  we told  everybody  what the  whole Paul  Abdul thing  was all  about  we certainly  you know  we are  at least  one day  ahead  of every  fucking  news agency  that's right  we report  you decide  I want to  have that  as our  saying 
[00:15:30]  I think  we're  way more  accurate  no  I don't  even want  to say  I think  we are  way more  accurate  than  especially  the local  news  than the  local  news  we blow  the local  news  away  more  perceptive  we dig  deeper  on the  first  day  absolutely  of a  story  and let  you know  what's  really  happening  while they  are just  reading the  teleprompter  fluff  and not  getting the  real story  many times  we reported  stuff  and the next  day they go  oh well  perhaps  Michael Jackson's 
[00:16:00]  kids were  being prompted  to certain  things  we had that  fucking days  in advance  and know  why  because we  use our  brains  right  we have to  use them  for something  of course  it's not  this  program  we use  our brains  and they  just  read  words  yeah  they're  reading  words  that are  scrolling  in front  of them  so yesterday  the news  of Paul  Abdul  quitting  look at me  with the quotes  in the air  Opie is now 
[00:16:30]  making quotation  marks with his  middle finger  and pointer  finger  on each hand  mind you  on either  side of his  head  you know why  I did that  why  because now  that I'm  pushing 40  I finally  figured out  what the  quotations  mean when  it goes  around a  word  oh  is that  what it  is  I finally  figured out  someone's  talking  and I  use it  all the  time now  it's nice  quit  quoting  hard to  twitter that  because it  takes up  valuable letters  I'm too busy  you know  tweeting sunsets 
[00:17:00]  while you're  tweeting  fucking  gun  fucking  violence  we'll get  into that  a little  later  look I  got stuck  with the  sunset  thing  I'll  explain  my point  in a  little bit  but first  so  Paul Abdul  goes  I quit  American Idol  and Ant and I  quickly go  whoa  I think I  actually said  har har  hearty  let's slow  down a little  bit  yes  and we  told the  local news  exactly what  happened  even though  we have  no connection  to American  Idol  they brought  the new  broad in  that doesn't  do the  pill popping  or whatever  the fuck  Paul Abdul 
[00:17:30]  does  she has a  much hotter  body  and she's  got a  brain  and she's  like  focused  yeah  you actually  want to  listen to  what she  has to  say  during this  American Idol  thing  and Paul  Abdul was  in there  and it was  obvious that  they were  pushing her  out  yep  they needed  a year  with the  new broad  with Paul  Abdul still  there  so then  you move  forward  you get rid  of Paul  Abdul  and no one  cares  because you  already got  used to  the new  broad  yeah  now it's  not like  oh my god  they fired  her for her  right  you got  used to  her  look  they were  all one  big happy  family  right  and then  Anthony  edited

[00:25:00]  I think so  and injured  others  injured a whole  bunch more  yeah  turns out  all the guy  needed  was to get  laid  he needed  some  boy  if only  a girl  would have  fucking  jacked them  off  sucked his  dick  something  done something  he hadn't  been laid  in about  20 years  I think  wow  and he  couldn't  hold  a girl  more  than a  week  and he  kept  talking  about  the  last  time  he  actually  spent  a night  sleeping  with a  girl  overnight  was like  when he was  20 or 
[00:25:30]  something like  that  right  86  some  ridiculous  thing  29  maybe  I'm  not sure  what it  was  but  this  guy's  blog  was  just  a  rambling  mess  of  red  flags  yeah  unfortunately  people  usually  don't read  other people's  loony logs  until  they do  something  crazy  well  there's  a lot  of  loony  blogs  out  there  what  are  you  supposed  to  do  yeah  read  each  one  and pick  it  apart  and red  flag  all these  although he did  keep mentioning  the exit  plan  oh really  yeah yeah 
[00:26:00]  there was  something he would  call the exit  plan  and how he  tried a couple  of times  or backed  out  or chickened  out  he went  through a couple  of test  runs  he was going  to do it  in January  and then  chickened  out  and then  why did  he pick  that gym  I'm not  really following  this story  it's too  horrific  because there  were women  in there  that upset  him  he probably  sat outside  and jerked  off looking  in the window  of that gym  if that's  possible  yeah he was  he said he  masturbated a lot  yeah he mentioned  oh if you're not  getting laid  of course  you gotta get  the poison out  yeah well  apparently he didn't 
[00:26:30]  get the poison out  he was an angry  angry man  and he just  kept talking  about how  all he would  do is dwell  on the past  like oh  and that was  20 years ago  and he knew  dates like  too much  he goes  the last time  was December  23rd  1986  like he knew  all these dates  and he'd just  say I've been  alive this long  what's another  20 years  of me just  being lonely  at home  I got a  promotion at work  but who cares 
[00:27:00]  like this isn't  what I want  my life to be  and like all  this just rambling  and rambling  and rambling  and his  the whole woman  thing  why don't women  like me  he kept talking  about how  there's like  30 million  eligible women  in the United  States  and not one  of them  likes him  was he an  ugly dude  no he looked  like a regular  kind of guy  he was just  a regular guy  he looks like  a guy that  should be getting  some pussy  apparently he  went tanning  and went to  the gym  so he stayed  in shape  you know what 
[00:27:30]  that's even  creepier that  he looks like  a regular  guy  I don't  know why  I was  really expecting  like  but chicks  just didn't  seem to  they always  said oh  you're such  a nice guy  he goes  that's why  when this  happens  and he  talked about  when I  do this  he goes  any notes  I leave  behind  please use  them  in your  research  to find  out why  people do  this  and  it was  like  he was  talking  about  how  women  would  are  going  to be  people  are going  to be 
[00:28:00]  surprised  because  I'm  such a  nice  guy  that  they're  not  going to  think  I  could  have  done  this  but  he goes  that was  part of  the problem  because the  women would  just look at me  like oh  I'm a nice  guy but go  no further  it's like  jeez  if one girl  would have  just fucked  this guy  it might have  been okay  you might have  just went  yeah  alright  that was  cool  20 years  later  I finally  get laid  well  here is  uh  oh  Katie Tong  remember her  good old  Katie Tong  smoothly 
[00:28:30]  transitions  from the  anchor desk  to her  pre-taped  George  Sardini  left a  blog  a window  into the  mind of  a madman  through it  we can  see a  man filled  with  loneliness  rage  and contempt  for women  in his own  words  the killer  talks about  many things  including  his sexual  frustration  his deep  longing for  a girlfriend  and what  he called  his exit  plan  oh that's  where she  fucks  sorry 
[00:29:00]  how to  give a  little  steve  dig  the  plan  we're  going to  have  that  the  blog  entries  reveal  Sardini  began  planning  his  killing  spree  at least  nine  months  ago  on  December  22nd  he writes  plan to  have this  done  already  many  of the  young  girls  here  at  the  gym  look  so  beautiful  as  to  not  be  human  very  edible  he was  really  he had  like a  thing  there was  some  guy  across  the  street  one  of his 
[00:29:30]  neighbors  who  he would  look out  the window  and see  this hot  young  like college  chick  leaving  that guy's  house  and it  would  just  kind of  infuriate  him  and he  would  see  girls  that were  like  and read  about  girls  that are  16  that are  having  more  sex  than  he's  had  in his  life  and it  would  just  upset  him  like he  was  definitely  into  younger  chicks  young  chicks  and  guns  apparently  yeah  real  twisted  son of 
[00:30:00]  a  bitch  what  nothing  just  looking  at  you  and he  was  lonely  apparently  just  looking  at  you  spent a lot  of time  alone  yeah  yeah  got any  blogs that I  could check  out  blogs  it's not  exactly a  blog it's a  website that  he posts  on frequently  something  mania  yeah  this is a  very good  question from  let's start  with Glenn  in Delaware  Glenn  hey  what's up  boys  hey Glenn  very good  question  go ahead

[00:31:00]  at least  in his  case  got a  promotion  sure  I would  think so  all right  Glenn  thank you  let's say  hi to  Bill  and PA  Bill  oh  Bill  hello  boys  hey  this guy  said  10 million  women  had turned  him down  do you  think he  was really  playing an  odds game  there  and struck  out every  time  10 million  what was he  expecting  every woman  he passed  by  he would  go to  Pittsburgh  pirate  games  and would  just walk  out onto  the mound  in between  the ends  and go  anybody  want to  fuck  me  75,000  knows  keep your 
[00:31:30]  eye on  Bobo  yeah  no kidding  Bobo's  coming in  today  I don't  know why  but let's  say hi to  Bob and  PA  Bob  yeah  I think  we need  to keep  an eye  on  this guy  was a  legal gun  owner  but  four guns  yes he  was  I read  that  see legal  gun  owner  aunt  this is  bad for  you guys  well  no  one against  you guys  it's  alright  wow  there's  there's  one  in the  never ending  controversy  and that  crazy woman

[00:34:30]  today's the joy I  feel today was  started when I  walked in and  you know now that  I'm pushing 40 and  then he did an air  quotes joke but  then he never went  back to the fact  he said pushing 40  it's like  what the fuck  happened  it was just funny  the way it was  like you were  kidding but then  it was just like  it just felt good  to say that  yeah why correct  it  no one's correcting  me so fuck it  I gotta adjust that  whole pushing 40  because now when  people meet me  they go wow  you look like shit  I'm like actually

[00:35:30]  since 1984  no sex  since July 1990  over 18 years  ago  every evening  I am alone  why should I  continue another  20 plus years  alone  then this  just 2 months  before the  killings  June 5th  I was reading  several posts  and it seems  many teenage  girls have  sex frequently  one 16 year  old does it  3 times a day  with her boyfriend  so after a month  of that  this little  ho has had  more sex  than me  in my life  one more reason 
[00:36:00]  thanks for  nada bitches  bye  hey sometimes  we only do it  twice a day  alright  guy's a good  writer though  at least  he certainly  is  thanks for  nada bitches  thanks for  nada bitches  wonder why  they wouldn't  fuck him with  hip lingo  like that  hip lingo  how could the  girls not have  been all over  him  spoke their  language  like god damn  fool  fucking asshole  I think the guy  was aiming a little  um  a little high  a little high  by aiming low  right  like  sometimes you 
[00:36:30]  can't swing  that hole  you know  I'm gonna be  a hipster  with the  youngsters  he was  perfect for  chubby chasing  I'm thinking  yeah get  yourself a fatty  start with the  chubby chasing  and then work  your way into it  if you haven't  been laid  I had a  girlfriend  since the  fucking 80s  right  you know  that's a guy  in a completely  arrested state  of development  as far as  his um  relationships go  he hasn't had  a girlfriend  or anything  since the  80s  so he's  still thinking  he wants  those girls  that he saw 
[00:37:00]  in the 80s  how was his  relationship  with his  mother  uh  horrid  as a matter  of fact  really  his family  his brother  his father  uh  he rails  against them  thanks for  the support  is a real  sarcastic writing  oh really  thanks so much  for all the  support you  gave me  uh  which I  assume was  none  or probably  a lot  and he just  didn't see it  that way  he's kind  of a kook  uh  so yeah  this guy  was  I read  through his  entire blog  last night 
[00:37:30]  did you really  yeah it was  fascinating reading  that's why  wow  it was like  really um  cause once you  realize what he  did  like if I just  if someone gave  me that blog  before he  did that  you'd be like  why the fuck  am I gonna read  this boring  asshole's blog  but then after  he does it  and you read it  you're like  holy shit  that's pretty  fucked up  this guy's  twisted  and the media  by the way  by quoting  guys like  this  all they do  is perpetuate  it  because it  empowers  this guy  like  the ramblings  of a madman  well that's  like the 
[00:38:00]  Virginia Tech  calling it  his manifesto  like it's  this important  historic  document  now  where  you know  what was  the name  of his  play again  the cat's  loose  on the  baseball  that's  crazy  come on  they're the  seahawks  kansas city  game  look at the  little cat  how funny  would it be  if an  umpire  just started  chasing it  with an axe  hysterical  oh the poor  little guy  look at him  go  oh it doesn't  know where  to go  oh there it  is  it's off  the field  clapped  yeah yeah  people clapped

[00:39:00]  and completely  listenable  maybe the guys  down the hall  could  maybe you could  get a sample  of some of  their banter  between the  stories  it's mind  boggling  how awful  it is  let's go to  Matt in  Connecticut  Matt  hey how you  doing guys  hey  early on  in the  blog  the guy's  blog  he mentioned  the election  and talked  about Obama  he says  how much  it doesn't  sound like

[00:44:00]  right on man  man did that band  fuck themselves up  hey the trees are  attacking us  like in M. Night  Shang-A-Lam  and it's happening  they're fighting back  there's a story  on the news right now  some woman jogger  in the Philadelphia area  just jogging along  oh a jogger  a jogger  loving life  getting a little exercise  before work  and a tree falls  and kills her  and recently  here in Central Park 
[00:44:30]  in New York City  guy was walking home  minding his own business  big huge limb  falls on top of him  gotta watch that  the trees are attacking  it's the weather  they're fighting back  it's just lousy weather  it's weakened everything  yeah  yeah you know what  that's very accurate  yeah the wind  and rain  and all that  crap  we got some  Louis C.K.  tweets  yeah  and I gotta start  by saying  well  that Anthony  showed me up 
[00:45:00]  so bad yesterday  it's not even funny  with this whole  twittering thing  well I don't twitter  a lot  and I usually  frown against  mass twittering  but I did twitter  a lot yesterday  well you go on stages  right  I had some video  and I only twitter  like video clips  or pictures  I never just go  hey I'm just doing this  yeah it's hard  to just tweet text  at this point  yeah yeah  you gotta be like  you gotta give the people  a little something  you gotta be some kind  of like new age poet  or something  you gotta like  you gotta really 
[00:45:30]  know your way  around words  or have some kind  of blog  where you hate  women  right  yeah  I don't feel  confident enough  just to tweet  words at this point  I have to back it up  with a picture  or a video  and then I feel  a little better  about my tweets  but  I tweeted  like a few  sunset pictures  here and there  and then what happened  this is where  I'm trying to  defend myself  a little bit  yeah  this is what  you don't see  I probably 
[00:46:00]  get  I don't  want to exaggerate  I probably  get 20  to 25  sunset pictures  a night now  that's nice  from people  all over  the world  Anthony  all over the world  so now I start  this thing  like I'll  post one  alright  sometimes two  sunset pictures  at the end of  each day  from somewhere  in the country  yeah  so I feel  like I'm  kind of trapped  in this  sunset world 
[00:46:30]  I hear you  and so  just another  day  and I tweeted  someone's  sunset picture  some dude  was driving  he's a regular  Bill something  he's a regular  to the show  and everything  and he was  driving  and he  ah  sunset  takes the picture  sends it to me  and then I  mass send it  you know  in my little  tweet  right  I'm thinking  nothing of it  I woke up  this morning  to check  my replies  on Twitter  and man  I was getting  pounded  they're like  you fucking 
[00:47:00]  asshole  you're fucking  you know  sending us  pictures of  cute little  sunsets  and Anthony  is sending  out videos  of him  blowing up  shit  and shooting  shit  it's like  we now know  who the girl  is in the  relationship  you sent  a picture  of a sunset  you twittered  a picture  of a sunset  yeah  I wasn't  sure that's  what you were  saying  well wait  I don't  understand  what you're  doing  I'm actually  not sure  if that's  what you  said  you weren't  listening  I was  listening 
[00:47:30]  but I  was like  I just  wasn't  registering  I'm like  and it  shouldn't  it just  was not  and it  shouldn't  but to  me  it's  kind of  cool  to know  that  somebody  somewhere  is like  wow  look at  I'm  capturing  the sun  going  down  I don't  know  in my  dumb  little  world  that  kind  of  excites  me  a little  bit  sunsets  can be  very  pretty  I go  out  on the  balcony  or something  like that  you watch  the sunset  and you go  you know  that's  fantastic  dude  you don't  have to  defend  the sunset 
[00:48:00]  but when  you blast  a watermelon  with a 50  caliber pistol  and watch  it explode  into a  mist  of red  and little  chunks  it's  magical  well let  me  well  people are  kind of  making the  comparison  going oh  that's  nice  Opie's  twittering  sunsets  and Anthony  is pretty  much getting  ready for  Armageddon  yeah here  we go  nice  dynamic  they thought  though  they like  the whole  yin yang  thing  of the whole 
[00:48:30]  twitter thing  wait I'm  trying to  find  okay  well there's  a sunset  from Key West  that I didn't  post yet  Jesus Christ  alright here we  go  Opie I love  how Anthony  is posting  gun shooting  movies all  night and  you're posting  sunsets  you're such  a girl  girl  Opie's  sending out  I don't want  to be called  a girl  he never  want to be  called a girl  I'd rather  be called  a faggot  jerk off  you're such  a girl  you're a girl  I'm not  and then you got  this guy  Brian  he goes by

[00:51:00]  not the end  but I didn't  know what else  to get  that's the best  gift ever  ever  but I know  what he needs  we understand  who's important  in your life  go ahead  what did you  send a wedding  gift  what  yeah  whatever  wait wait  he did say  for a while  it was in the  mail  or it was  coming  no no no  I actually  I have the  whole thing  I wanted to  get you  why is Jimmy  the shit  stirrer today  I'm not 
[00:51:30]  trying to  you had to  stop and go  wait  what  I actually  I'm really  not  I just  it was my  birthday  see I'm  supposed to  get the  exact same  fax  a copy  machine that  I have  which is really  good because  do you have  a fax machine  now  well I do  yeah  oh you do  well I guess  that's it  why did  open get  married  1988  a fax  machine  well  it's that  I got you  an AOL  subscription  I got one  of these  discs  I'm pushing 
[00:52:00]  by the way  nine months  of marriage  so you know  it's okay  it's up to a  year I hear  huh  I hear it's up  to a year  you're okay  you got three  months  you want an AR-15  actually that would  be so fucking  cool  get a rifle  that would be  cool  rifles are fun  fire it out  your window  at the fucking  water  oh shit  so you went  shooting with  Keith with  Keith's brand new  birthday present  yeah  and I see he  brought watermelons  yeah a bunch  of watermelons  and just watching 
[00:52:30]  watermelons  explode  is hysterical  there's something  about shooting  watermelons with  .50 caliber  handguns  this is one of  his first shots  he nails it  it's on YouTube  my YouTube  account is  O-P-A-N-T-X-M  that's my  account  O-P-A-N-T-X-M  he hit that thing  so dead on  that it made  every other  shot like  eh  because I  nailed one of  the cantaloupes 
[00:53:00]  but um  I  I hit it  but it didn't  have that  spectacular  explosion  that this  one had  I think it was  used in a  hollow point  too on that  one  but the  cantaloupe  I would  imagine would  stay together  a little better  than a watermelon  yeah yeah  watermelon has  more of a  crack  a little more  pressure  in the  like the skin  is thicker  and harder  than a cantaloupe  so the cantaloupe  didn't like  come apart  like that  that's how  the cantaloupe  laughs  I had to  take the butt  of my gun  and smash  the cantaloupe 
[00:53:30]  big teeth  big stupid teeth  the video  the video of him  blowing up the  watermelon  is pretty  pretty impressive  and then go to  the shotgun  and you should do  slow motion  or freeze frame  and you see  just the  the watermelon  just completely  gone  with the mist  of the watermelon  you know  this is a  semi-automatic  shotgun  no pumping  necessary  you  you just  gotta go back  to the beginning  this is  why don't you  show jimmy

[00:57:30]  they call  he crumpled  his clothes  and had  stuff on  fucking  corners  that's what  i call him  i was passed  out from my  first  i was nappy  against an  oak tree  behind the  wheel  speaking of  tweets and  twitter and  what's not  it was a busy  day for everybody  on twitter  because louis ck  was drunk twittering  and there's nothing  better than drunk  twittering  it's one of my  favorite things  yeah to read  um so here we 
[00:58:00]  go louis ck  from last night  10 hours ago  i'm on an  airplane yes  in a chair in  the sky i'm  drunk rare for  me this just  happened louis ck  heading to parks  and rec comedian  lands multi-episode  arc on nbc show  are you fucking  serious  yeah apparently  that's uh that  show's got a little  buzz the amy  polar uh show  oh park and  rec okay  holy shit  louis was in  here last week 
[00:58:30]  he didn't mention  this i know  sometimes you gotta  keep uh you know  mums the word  not a little cameo  it says lands  multi-episode arc  on nbc show  that's huge for  louis  congratulations  i thought this  was gonna be  about drunk  twittering but  that's very cool  knowledge right  there yes  and then louis  uh tweeted this  um a little  later  what if i  started shit  on this plane  and you saw  the news that a  plane is being  escorted by f-17s  just kidding  seriously  just kidding  so he was able  to tweet in the 
[00:59:00]  sky i guess he  was on one of  those planes with  the wi-fi  i think american  has that  it's gonna be  everywhere within  months i would  imagine  and then finally  this as louis ck  continued his uh  drunk twittering  i just ate a lot  of ice cream  now i'm drunk  and feel like a  giant piece of  shit in the sky  fuck all of you  all 35,519 of you  what's wrong with that  and then he writes  sorry  what's wrong  with louis  he's drunk  that's probably  why he doesn't  drink that much  lonely in the sky  fucking ice cream 
[00:59:30]  eating mexican  sending dangerous  twits  i know  what a creep  sending questionable  tweets  what a silly  red-headed goose  in honor of your  watermelon um  shooting video  oh yes  we gotta play the  eat that watermelon  by nick cannon  and naz  waddy melon  now uh i i was  doing a little  learning yesterday  were ya  and and the  youngsters out there  there's some  youngsters that  aren't don't  really like where  hip-hop is going  because it is going 
[01:00:00]  to this uh just  this just dirty  place  this uneducated  dirty place  what were they  calling buffoonery  right  they were calling  it buffoonery  they don't like  that hip-hop  artists are  spreading buffoonery  i'm still confused  by the video that  everyone is checking  out uh the nick  cannon and naz  eat that watermelon  because they're  basically saying  if if hip-hop  continues down  this corporate  road you're  gonna be hearing  you know songs  and videos like  the one they put  out they were  they were mocking 
[01:00:30]  it i think i'm  still confused by  that yes yeah i  think they were  did you hear this  yet jimmy i have  not no i'm a little  out of the loop  news wise i haven't  read a paper in a  fucking week and a  half why what's  wrong just because i  was you're always up  at six in the morning  every morning and  just sit in a trailer  the world blew up you  wouldn't have known  jimmy i would have  because the set  would have been gone  i would have  shown up to a  trailer would  have been gone  oh i'm dead  there's a period of  great distress in the  rap universe there  was a time when hip-hop  was a form of  empowerment now the  corporate world is 
[01:01:00]  quickly diluting our  culture for nothing  more than profit with  the ever-mountain  forces of ridiculous  dances ignorant  behavior and general  buffoonery it's only a  matter of time before  hip-hop's permanent  annihilation this is what  the future holds if it  don't stop  howdy there shook  top of the morning  to you jive  boy you know this  show is a good  diddy right here  massive gonna love 
[01:01:30]  us  you know i was  hungry what should  we eat  some of that good  old watermelon  oh yeah  eat that watermelon  eat that watermelon  eat that watermelon  surely it's good  eat that watermelon  eat that watermelon  eat that watermelon  surely it's good  mess up it's coming 
[01:02:00]  mess up it's coming  mess up it's coming  shh  hide the water  man  hide the queen  yo check it y'all  this is Nas  and if that don't stop  hip-hop is dead  but enough of this 
[01:02:30]  fucking phony rebellion  in hip-hop  then don't take the  corporate money  as much as it does  annoy me the way the  corporations do things  the amount of money  they're paying guys  stop don't take it if  you don't want to be a  part of it  you're Nas you can  still make whatever  kind of music you make  of course  don't accept the money  just don't don't do  what they want you to  do  yeah say uh no  i think they wanted  to make a just a silly  video exactly and then  they came up with some  kind of cause  kind of cause like  right  very shallow cause so  so people aren't  attacking them for 
[01:03:00]  making this pretty  outrageous rap video  yeah just admit you  want to do something  silly or outrageous  or even funny  fine it's Nas  instead of Nas  alright whatever  Nas  yeah isn't N-A-S  pronounced Nas  um uh normally  Nas-Dak  see but it's Nas  Nas  the Nas-Dak  the Nas-Dak  sorry that I  pronounce it the  white way I guess  no no no that  there is well  hard to say  is that not happening  that was the right  answer that was  Nas  Waz  it's very hard to 
[01:03:30]  W-A-S is  Waz is different too  it's like uh  it's it's hard  Nas  Nas  there's no right  way to do it it  seems like  Nas  Waz  well  imagine somebody  just turning on  this radio show  for the first time  Waz  Nas  Waz  get by  N-A-S is  well  I call them  one thing  what  what's that  Jesus  holy shit  it's a damn good song  Nas  what a  what a  speaking of  good songs  well  I know 
[01:04:00]  where you're  going  and I have  it in my  hand  we're thinking  the same  thing  I know  Jimmy we got  a nice treat  for you  just to finish  up on this  though  white guys  do that  video  I want to  say it  again  they are  so fired  from life  done  so done  yeah it's  that double  standard that  will never  go away  right  but what  are you  going to  do  about it  you want  to present  this to  Jimmy  Jimmy  you  are a  genius  you are  a genius  how do I  know this  is not  going to  be good  no no  no  it actually  is good  it's  actually 
[01:04:30]  we're all  together  on this  one  when you  came up  with  your  Van Halen  song  we're  back  and better  than ever  we're  back  together  forever  sure  can we  get a  little  piece  of that  just so  people  know  wonderful  I love  this  yeah  come on  yeah  we're  back  we've been  away 
[01:05:00]  for a  long  long  long  time  we've been  through  changes  we've played  some games  the more  things change  the more  things stay  the same  yeah  we're a little  bit old  to believe  what  we're back  we're  better  than ever  we're  back  we're  back  together  forever  we're  back  we're 
[01:05:30]  back  we're  better  than ever  we're  back  we're  back  yeah  so you  remember that  obviously you  wrote it  jimmy  jimmy  uh  unfortunately  van halen  didn't quite  put a song  together like  that  but  somebody  picked up  that ball  and  fucking  ran with  it  so  closely  that i  have to  believe  someone  heard 
[01:06:00]  we're  back  and thought  it would  be a  great idea  for a  song  from a  band  that was  big  in the  80s  didn't do  shit  got back  together  uh  and for  their big  anniversary  compilation album  of their  hits  whatever  those  are  uh  they  wrote a  new  song  and the  new  song  is  i guess  they're  taking it  seriously  it's  it's  twisted  sister  twisted  and they  do a  song  that's  called  called  30  and it's 
[01:06:30]  on the  stay  hungry  cd  the 25th  anniversary  of stay  hungry  they put  a new  song  on there  and the  whole  gist  a lot  like  your  song  the  whole  gist  of  30  man  is  that  they  went  before  they  were  30  when they  were  rocking  they  didn't  think  past  30  man  you know  you know  man  you're  just  rocking  exactly  and then  hold on  holy  shit  my god  what the  fuck  what is  going on  I love  how tall  he is 
[01:07:00]  shut up  Jimmy  why do they  walk  around like  the Farnam  Baldies  with that  one girl  that's Nicole  from the  morning mashup  this one girl  and all those  guys  and no  touching her  she's got  big  boobies  she's got  big  warm  boobies  I don't  like that  oh anyway  yeah  where were we  yeah we were  talking about  Twisted Sister  this song  30  and how it's  about  you know  they didn't  think about  that man  but you know  something  they're back  together  and now  like they're 
[01:07:30]  thinking about  you know  they're past  30  but dude  they're still  rocking  you want to  hear it  you bet  I do  it's even  like the  same music  that they  put behind  your song  we're back  oh what  see man  this is your 
[01:08:00]  song  never gave  a damn  by the  other side  of the hill  other side  of the hill  nothing  could stop  us  nothing  ever  will  that's the part  that killed us  yesterday  we're like  why didn't  D do another  take there  he obviously  fucked up  the take  but nothing  could stop  us  nothing  ever  will  prostate  cancer  would  I have a 
[01:08:30]  problem  with the fact  that it got  very wordy  all of a sudden  and the other  side of the hill  because you know  when you hit 30  they say you're  over the hill  so they never  thought of being  over that hill  man  but they're there  and dude  it's still  rocking  listen  hill and will  yeah  nothing  could stop  us  nothing  never  will  and when  we hit  the stage  like you  never  know  30  came  and went  a long  time  ago  and we're 
[01:09:00]  back  okay  terrific  hokey  is the word  that just  comes to mind  the point  I hate the most  is hill and will  being rhymed  yeah  that's very  very  oh god  is it  juvenile  yes  amateur  exactly what  it is  a third grader  would rhyme  hill  on the side  of the hill  I feed birds  by leaving bread  on my windowsill  anything  would have been 
[01:09:30]  better  would have been  original  I like to write  my rhymes  with a quill  I wouldn't have  seen it coming  30 miles away  I sucked off  jack  and ass fingered  jill  oh  Dominic Barber  is on TV  again  of course  yeah  all right  here we go  second verse  rock the 80s  like thought  they'd never  end  they can still  do it 
[01:10:00]  they're rocking  we can curse  we can fight  we can go  all night  still tearing  up  even  more  but it came  and went  a long  long time  ago  that is that  25  so alive  nothing but no  road on our  minds  25  it was a  rocked out  knocked out  sold out  show  every time  know that  know that  yeah  we can do it  we can do it  we can do it  we can do it  we can do it 
[01:10:30]  yeah  burning through  the night  headed for the  promised land  know where that  is  pussy  certainly did  it certainly  did  it's your song  though Jimmy  yeah it's  pretty much  we're back  and better than  ever  yeah  because  it came  and went  but they're  still rocking  it doesn't  matter  they didn't  think about  it  such a long  long long  long long 
[01:11:00]  time ago  yeah I know  believe me  it reminds me  a little  Jimmy shut up  will you shut  the fuck up  everybody will  give a wave  how you doing  they're coming  back with their  beverages  we're not waving  to the guys  they're coming  back with their  beverages  hey if we  acknowledge then  we get her to  go by a lot  slower  oh god  what the hell's  going on there  wow  what  horses jumping  over cars  for some reason  yeah that's way  more important  than what we  were just  watching  it is  I've better  shot at  fucking them 
[01:11:30]  oh fuck  see  what happened  why would they  show it again  in slow motion  a horse actually  ran right over  the front of a car  on the highway  and jumped on it  and jumped on it  he jumped over it  yeah  broke the windshield  he did a ride  so you want more  of the 30 song  30 came and went  well now we have  the guitar song  oh I gotta hear that  the obligatory  you know I just saw 
[01:12:00]  the video on TMZ  now I'm in  how the fuck  do you explain that  to your insurance  guy  yeah  there's hoof prints  on my hood  it's like  yeah right  destroy the fucking  windshield  yeah  lucky to be alive  go to TMZ  if you want to  check out the video  of the horse  jumping over the car  and  jumping over it  well barely  well barely  he kind of missed  boy was that  Christopher Reeve's horse  fucking  Jesus  and you know what 
[01:12:30]  when these horses  are racing  they twist a little  ankle  next thing you know  they're dead  this guy  this horse looks  like he was fine  after bumping  into the car  is he running  yeah he's still  like landed on his  feet  I would love to  hear that phone  call to the  insurance guy  you know  it's poor  poor thing  it's in a grill  you're not  you're not covered  for bovine  bovine  you're covered  for hogs  and kittens  but not bovine  you're covered  for gorillas 
[01:13:00]  and bears  but not horses  guitar solo or not  yeah  okay  what the fuck 
[01:13:30]  is it  oh he has to  tell you where  that's your guitar  is this the video  for it  wow  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  Oh, my God. 
[01:14:00]  All right.  We get it.  You can play the guitar.  How much guitar do we need?  Jesus.  Guitar solos are outdated anyway in songs.  Of course.  Uh, wow. 
[01:14:30]  Just so guitar.  Just so we can clear the phone lines, Jimmy, everyone is saying that bovine is a cow.  I know it is.  I just couldn't think of, I was thinking of there in the same thing.  Equine.  Was equine a horse?  Equine.  They couldn't call fast enough to call you out on that.  My apologies.  You caught me being wrong.  Finally.  That's enough of that dumb song.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Enough.  What do you think, Jimmy?  It's a lot like We're Back.  It really is.  It's kind of crazy.  It's the same kind of, yeah, feel to it. 
[01:15:00]  Some of the primitive, I'm watching the video for it.  They really should not show the early Twisted and then these big, huge, fat gentlemen.  Some of the lyrics annoy me.  Like, it's like, you know, the hill and what's that?  Hill and Will.  Well.  We can drink.  We can cuss.  We can fight all.  Well, you know, you're not.  Who can't curse?  It's really fuck all.  Who can't curse?  I curse a lot.  It's really fuck all night. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, you know, they had to keep it friendly for a radio airplane.  Oh, God.  Brad in Arkansas.  Brad.  Good evening.  Hi, buddy.  Brad.  Brad.  Y'all need to pull up the song Red, White, and Blue by Lynyrd Skynyrd if you want to  hear some cheesy lyrics.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It makes the Twisted Sister sound reasonable.  I like Skynyrd, too.  Damn it.  Well, the problem is they're trying to, like, come up with another hit.  Oh, is it a new one?  It's not an old one? 
[01:16:00]  Red, White, and Blue.  Well, it might be older now.  Is it Van Zandt?  It's not that classic Skynyrd that we all know and love.  It's what they call Lynyrd Skynyrd now, which is not Lynyrd Skynyrd.  It's probably mid-90s.  Oh, okay.  That song's been out for over 10 years already.  Good day, boys.  As long as it's not Ronnie Van Zandt, I would feel bad shitting on him.  I would.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  I've had enough of Kid Rock hanging with these guys, though.  We got it.  You like them.  Move on.  Let's fucking get on with things.  We don't have no plastic L.A. friends, ain't on the edge of no popular trend, ain't never 
[01:16:30]  seen the inside of that magazine GQ.  Attacking L.A., that's pretty fucking dangerous.  Wow.  We don't care if you're a lawyer or a Texas oil man.  Say a Jew.  Jew.  I know.  I thought that was funny, man.  Ain't on the edge of no popular trend, ain't never seen the inside of that magazine GQ.  Most people have it.  Yeah. 
[01:17:00]  Who cares?  Inside of any book with words.  Yeah, you can't read, you idiots.  But you do read Hang Em High Monthly.  Liquor stand?  We hang out with people just like you.  Do you?  Well, people like us read GQ occasionally and go to Los Angeles for business, you fucking  hillbilly.  My neck's always been red.  My collar's still blue.  Oh, blue collar.  We've always been here trying to sing the truth to you. 
[01:17:30]  Guess you could say.  Wow, they were going for their, the new Freebird.  This isn't awful, though.  It's not as bad.  It's a little hokey, but.  Yeah, it's a little.  It's not as bad as that other one.  It's precisely.  It's a little hokey.  Right.  Ride our own bikes to Sturgis and pay our own dues. 
[01:18:00]  Smoking campbells and drinking domestic brews.  Yeah.  If you want to know where I've been, just look at my hands.  All right.  Are you licking jizz off of them?  I kind of like this, though.  Am I nuts?  Yeah.  It's all right.  It's not going to hurt anyone.  It's not deuce chilly. 
[01:18:30]  It's just like a little bit.  It's way better than that 30 song we just played.  They should have found a little better points, like, you know, plastic L.A.  Well, I'm at the 90s.  All right.  So, come on, guys.  Hey, before break, you got the Yankees and Red Sox going at it again.  Have the Yankees won one game against the Red Sox this year?  No.  0-8.  Is that what I read today?  0-8 against the Sox.  That's a big rivalry every year, too.  But the Yankees are on quite a roll.  Quite a roll.  I know.  All that does is mow poorly for Boston in the playoffs. 
[01:19:00]  Because there's no way.  If the Yankees were to lose every game to them this year, they would probably sweep  the Red Sox in the playoffs.  That's the way it works.  Yeah, yeah.  And why are we saying Boston?  We all know it's Bofferson.  Bofferson.  Bofferson.  The Bofferson Red Sox is the way it seems to be the team.  What?  What'd you say?  Can we just play Menino Audio for Boston?  Bofferson.  Do we really need a reason to play more of his Donovan?  No.  Give me one we can play. 
[01:19:30]  I was in Danvers outside of Boston.  That's where I was this week.  And it was like 30 miles and 25 years outside of Boston.  Dude, there's no good.  I didn't even go into downtown Boston.  There's no good food.  Nothing!  In Danvers?  On Route 1.  We drove Route 1, which was just shitty fucking place after shit.  I really missed Boston.  I was 20 miles from Boston.  I really missed it.  Yeah, Route 1 is, yeah, you go back in time walking down that road.  No man's land up there.  Terrible.  Well, we segway into John Sterling, awful home run calls, one of our favorite bits. 
[01:20:00]  Yep.  I've got to tell you, this is like two days ago now.  We were saving these for Jimmy.  Yeah.  Johnny Damon hits a, well, this is well.  There's the 2-2.  Swung on, a high fly to right and deep.  That ball is high.  It is far.  It is gone!  Johnny Damon hit an off-speed pitch, a hanging breaking ball, into the Yankee bullpen and  right.  Oh, what a home run. 
[01:20:30]  It's a Johnny rocket, and the Yankees take a 3-1 lead.  Oh, and if that isn't a big run, it really is.  It's such a different Johnny with his 18th home run of the season.  You know, there is a difference, 3-1 than 2-1.  Is there?  Yes, there's one run difference.  I cannot, I cannot listen to her anymore, and ever.  Not that I ever did.  Why was she so calm there?  I can't take her seriously in any way, shape, or form. 
[01:21:00]  Why, she raises good points.  Yeah, yeah, the numbers are different when someone scores a run.  3 is better than 2!  My goodness, the scorekeeper knows how to count!  That's what the fuck.  Oh, God.  But, you know, all right, Steve in Connecticut, we got to acknowledge that the, I don't know  if that's true, though.  The Leonard Skinner song came out after 9-11.  The other dude said it came out in the 90s, though.  When was 9-11?  2001. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, 2001.  2001.  We're looking at, before you know, it's going to be the 10-year anniversary.  And they were saying that they are not looking to have a building there until 18 or 17 or  18 years after 9-11.  It's disgusting.  The red tape in this fucking city is disgraceful.  It's something, it's a common theme on this show, more mismanagement.  Because I actually, there's a bike path down there.  I get down there once in a while, maybe once a month or so.  I go all the way down that way. 
[01:22:00]  And the whole area is rebuilt, except for where the two towers went down.  And you got to remember, a lot of buildings were destroyed in that area.  They had to knock buildings down, start over, all this shit.  All the other buildings are pretty much now built.  And there's still just a hole in the ground.  The hole actually is almost on the surface, finally.  Yeah, because they do a lot of foundation work.  Yeah, they built it up to ground level, wherever you want to call it.  I'm wondering, dude, if there's a method to that.  Like, if they purposely built everything else first, because I know that years ago, and 
[01:22:30]  this is that they were having a lot of trouble renting any of the top floors.  No one's going to rent and put their entire workforce on the 90th floor, because no one's  going to go up there and work, because it's now a target.  You don't even need to build it that high anymore.  But I'm saying, that's what people want.  Although, we should just rebuild the towers immediately.  But again, people wouldn't have moved in, though.  I agree with you guys, but people wouldn't have moved in.  So maybe they're waiting until...  Maybe do something with those other, the top floors.  Do something.  Maybe they're waiting until...  Put a gym up there.  Al-Qaeda's fucking eradicated on some level, or until there's a lot of progress made where 
[01:23:00]  people would feel safer moving in.  I don't see it that way, Jimmy.  I think it's just red tape, like you first said, and mismanagement.  It's ridiculous.  There's been a lot of them built already.  Why are they waiting for last on those two?  I think they can't decide what to do.  All around the perimeter.  I still think they can't decide what to do.  It actually looks really nice down there.  I don't know.  But there's no excuse for 17 or 18 years after the fact, then we're going to see buildings  there. 
[01:23:30]  I mean, get the fuck out of here.  And we're moving on to...  Wow, we're right around the corner from eight years ago.  Eight years ago.  And yeah, there's not a hint of a building there.  Donkey punch.  Bloomberg is trying to figure out how he can integrate tables and chairs into the middle  of the street where the towers used to be.  Boy, is he fucking embarrassing there, man.  I liked Mike Bloomberg, too.  But with this...  Mike!  The way this passive-aggressive dickhead is doing this with the roads, it just makes 
[01:24:00]  me hate him.  And it is really out of spite.  He didn't get his way with the traffic situation where he wanted to start charging people to  come into the city.  And if he had it his way, there would be no commuters coming in by car.  None.  They would all use public transportation.  That's fine.  Not for me, my friend.  Not for me.  That a boy, Ant.  And...  Yes.  And...  You gotta pound your fist when you say something like that.  Not for me. 
[01:24:30]  And so he's spiteful.  And so he closes roads.  He puts fucking tables and chairs where people get head lice because the homeless are now  taking over those chairs.  It's wonderful.  All right.  Back to the home run calls.  The chinch bugs.  It's disgusting to even talk about.  Manganese.  It's ridiculous.  Yes.  There's traffic, dude.  It's 5 in the morning sometimes.  Or 5.30 when I'm coming to work.  Going down Broadway.  There's two lanes at the beginning of Broadway.  It's like, what are you, you asshole?  Two lanes.  It's Broadway in Manhattan. 
[01:25:00]  Dude.  It's not Broadway in some fucking piece of shit podunk town.  We got the new way to come to work.  Kenny didn't tell you.  I went seventh today.  What?  It is way faster.  I know.  I went today.  It's being extremely local.  It cuts it down in half the time.  Here's another.  Crazy.  I'm going to move on because no one gives a shit about local fucking traffic in Manhattan.  Seventh?  If they do.  Seventh is a big topic of discussion.  Of course it is.  Another bad.  It's one more than sixth. 
[01:25:30]  Hey, have they ever done.  Get it, dunce.  Have they ever done like some kind of poll as far as Yankee fans go if they like this  John Sterling or not in these dumb home run calls?  I don't know.  I can't imagine.  I'm not a Yankee fan.  I know you don't like him.  I know Jimmy doesn't like him and you guys are Yankee fans.  I can't imagine that the average fan likes this shit.  You know what I think it is?  I think people don't mind it as much because it means that they just scored.  Like, so you're kind of caught up in the, yeah, got one on the board or something like 
[01:26:00]  that, you know?  So you kind of just take it for granted like, ah, I don't give a shit what this guy's saying.  I'm kind of rejoicing that, you know, Johnny Damon, Johnny Rocket sent a Johnny Rocket.  Johnny Rocket?  Oh, he's just coming up.  Why Johnny Rocket?  Because, I don't know, it's a burger joint.  Why is he referencing a shit burger?  And I mean that very nicely because the Johnny Rocket burgers are terrific, but man, they  know how to clear out your system immediately. 
[01:26:30]  Really?  You ever go to a burger joint where you're literally taking a shit as you swallow your  last bite of the burger?  That place we went to when we first got to a fucking, uh, the city.  Jackson Hole?  Oh my God.  Jackson Hole.  Jackson Hole.  That's, that's a great fucking, uh.  Holy shit.  That is a great thing, yeah.  What is in those burgers?  My God.  You can eat other burgers and you can sit there and relax, have a few beers, enjoy your company  or whatever. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  And then there's other times you eat at a burger joint and you have to find the nearest  bathroom and you're more than willing to shit on the floor if you don't find a bathroom.  You need to get whatever's in you out.  You're fucking shitting as you're eating the burger.  What is that about?  I don't know, but that was Jackson Hole.  Jackson Hole.  Can we wake up, uh, the winemaker, that stupid winemaker and ask him about why certain burgers  will clear out your system almost immediately?  I thought it took a while to digest stuff and... 
[01:27:30]  Dude, we go to Jackson Hole right now.  Yeah.  We will be shitting within minutes.  All right.  So there has to be...  Let's go.  Who's in?  That's right.  I take the floor with a chest opener.  So there has to be a connection.  There has to be a connection.  Yeah.  What is that connection?  I need a doctor immediately.  Jim in Chicago, by the way, loves the Twisted Sister song.  Holy shit.  No, he doesn't.  He's an idiot.  Jim?  Yeah, what's up, buddy?  Yeah.  No, it's Jim from Chicago. 
[01:28:00]  Go ahead, James.  What's wrong with the song?  It sucks.  It's hokey.  It's, um...  It's, uh...  It's got that guitar solo.  It's got an 80s sound.  That's awesome.  What's wrong with the 80s?  I think you guys suck.  No.  You know what sucks about the 80s?  Wait, did you say I think you guys suck?  You're listening to us, so we obviously don't suck.  Like, some 80s shit is cool to listen to because it was the 80s when it was made.  To make it now...  Hey, if you guys want us to do a good show in the morning, listen to Howard Stern. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, yeah?  Howard 100.  Howard 100.  Howard Stern rules.  Open Anthony.  You know how stupid you sound right now?  All right.  You know how stupid you sound right now?  And you know what the funny thing is?  You know why he's listening to us?  Because Howard's off for a month.  Yeah.  See?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Keep going.  Sorry, you didn't mention me.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Sorry, you didn't mention me. 
[01:29:00]  Twisted.  So they like Twisted and Howard.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're fags.  That's right.  You got that right.  You like Twisted Sister and Howard Stern?  What's that, buddy?  You do know that this backfired, right, guys?  You do know.  Wait, hold on.  You know how stupid you sound?  Do you watch Miami Vice, too?  I watch Magnum P.I., though.  Oh, Magnum P.I.  All right.  See, now we can get along.  See?  We all like Magnum P.I.  Well, he's making fun of Anson Mustache.  Yeah. 
[01:29:30]  Get it?  All right, guys.  Get it?  I want to be insulted by the guy.  Hold on.  Jim, I know you have to listen to us because Howard's off for, what, another week, two weeks?  I understand.  You need live programming.  So enjoy the show until Howard's back.  Could you insult me, too?  You insulted all, but I feel left out.  Yeah, insult Jimmy.  Yeah, could you insult Jimmy a little bit?  No, Jimmy's the greatest.  I love Jimmy.  You don't love me.  Get out of here, buddy.  Boom!  All right.  You guys are assholes.  All right.  Bye.  Yeah, that's funny.  I think that backfired, though.  You got to admit, guys.  I think they're fans. 
[01:30:00]  See, I think they're fans.  They were being a little too wacky there.  I know the Howard fans get frustrated.  They don't get a lot of live programming.  We understand.  But just enjoy the show until he comes back, and then he can go back there.  That's fine.  That's fine.  You know?  Serious talk, by the way.  Fucking, uh...  Impressive lately.  What's going on?  I don't know.  What's going on?  Apparently a word of my stuff leaked out.  Ah.  Something leaked out.  That's true.  All right.  The awful winemaker's on the phone.  Oh, is he?  Yeah.  Dr. Steve. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, good.  Hey, Kevorkian.  Welcome aboard.  Okay.  Dr. Steve.  Now, here's the question for you today.  Did you just wake up?  Uh...  No, I've been up for a couple minutes.  Because I don't want the text later on today that says, uh, did I sound good because you  woke me up?  I don't know what I was saying.  Like, people are listening to you for real medical advice, and then I get a text later  in the day where it's quite scary that you're just talking in your sleep.  Yeah.  That's what happens when you call me at six, asking me.  Ooh. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, so it's our fault.  Harsh words from Dr. Steve.  I like how he...  Racist.  Really?  I like how he gives us, you know, medical advice and any questions we have in the air,  and then he'll send a text that's like, fucking Michio Kaku's an asshole.  Right.  Like, he's got to have his personal opinions.  Speaking the truth, my friend.  Steve, this is an unusual question today.  Yeah.  We all like a fine hamburger, right?  Sure.  Okay.  Why is it you go to some of these burger joints, and you have a hamburger, and you get the 
[01:31:30]  shits immediately?  Yeah.  I thought it took longer for, you know, the body to absorb food and have the effects of  what you eat.  Well, and you're smart enough to know that the shit isn't the actual burger you just ate,  but there's something in the burger that's pushing all the other shit out of you.  Well, I don't understand that because sometimes you eat something, and then it gives you, like,  runny shit.  And how does solid shit, and your abdomen feels fine, then you eat something, and it's not  digested and in your intestine yet, yet you're getting those cramps, and now you're, you know, 
[01:32:00]  water's coming out of your asshole.  Doctor?  Right.  Right.  Okay.  Um, what happens is there's two things.  There's a reflex that's called the gastrocholic reflex.  Bullshit!  I love that Duran Duran song.  Ooh, boo.  I don't get it.  No one does.  When you fill your stomach up, then the body's impetus is to empty out the colon. 
[01:32:30]  Now, so that's why a lot of times when you eat a big meal, you may have the shits now,  or need to shit soon thereafter.  Now, the reason that you're having this kind of effect, where you're having sort of the, you know,  cathartic effect, is because something in the burger has irritated your GI tract.  And if it happens consistently, it's something that they're using as a filler.  For me, it's onions. 
[01:33:00]  For other people, it may be, you know, nice.  Wait, let's...  Yes!  Check.  Check.  Let's slow down the good doctor.  Hold on.  The good doctor.  So onions give you the watery shits there, Dr. Steve?  Yeah, absolutely.  Oh, that's a shame.  But what happens is...  Can't wait to give him an onion-y smoothie when it comes to New York in October.  I know.  Whenever he sees Ivan Putzky, he has to make a wet duty.  Good reference.  Nothing but onions for you when you visit New York, my friend. 
[01:33:30]  Okay, okay.  Yeah.  Well...  Jesus.  Sorry.  When the GI tract gets irritated, it secretes fluid into the middle of the intestine, and  it can do this really fast.  Ah.  And it can secrete gallons sometimes.  Holy shit, really?  Yeah.  So...  And that must just soften up your shit real quick.  All of a sudden, what you've got is just a bunch of liquid fecal matter in there, and 
[01:34:00]  it's, you're spewing it out, so...  What's with the cramping?  What's with intestinal cramping?  Well, again, that's when the GI tract gets irritated, it wants to get rid of whatever is  in it, and so it just cranks up the peristalsis.  Yeah.  Thanks a lot, sir.  It's a movement of the bowel that forces stuff from the upper end to the lower end.  And that will manifest itself as cramping. 
[01:34:30]  And other things will cause it, too, if you've got a lot of gas in there, the bowel's trying  to contract, you know, you'll get gas bubbles, and that will cause cramping as well.  Poor design.  Poor design.  Should have been made out of steel.  We should have steel intestines.  Well, then one pump from the top, and it seems to be shooting out your other end.  Yeah, that's true.  Because there's no, you know, resistance to it.  Sure.  The way to absorb up the goodness, right.  You know, you were speaking of cum in hamburgers. 
[01:35:00]  We actually had a case down here where a guy got caught jacking into the mayonnaise.  The mayonnaise?  Literally.  When they caught him, you know, because they got those big giant tubs of mayonnaise in the  back, and he got caught jacking, and it turned out that he, when he finally confessed to it,  that he'd been doing it for months.  Jesus.  Wow.  Burgers.  Oh. 
[01:35:30]  It was quite the big news in Greensboro, North Carolina.  Well, how do you not fucking kill that guy?  What happened?  Someone jacking off into the mayonnaise.  For mayonnaise, as the doctor says.  Hey, we got a question for you, Dr. Steve.  Mike in Albany.  Mike, you're on with Dr. Steve.  Hey, Dr. Steve.  Question for you.  What about when you get, like, the bubbles and the rumbling, you know, bubble guts?  Bubble guts.  What's that all about?  Sounds like a rusty hinge sometimes.  Wait, I've got some alarm going off here in my house. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, it's time to shit.  Get a gun.  Okay.  Yeah, it's probably just somebody breaking in down here.  Yeah.  When you got the bubbles and the rumbling again, that's just, oh, it's my beeper.  Ah, they could wait.  Glad you're on the phone with a dirty radio show.  Really?  It's like a heart attack.  Snake a tube up her nose and tell her I'll be there in 45 minutes.  That's a little Dr. Peeper, but it's okay. 
[01:36:30]  I'll answer Mike's question.  Now, the bubbles and the rumbling again is there's almost always some gas in your intestines.  And then if you start secreting fluid into the intestine, then it'll start bubbling around in there.  And as it moves, you'll get bubbles of air moving up while you've got boluses of liquid moving down.  And you'll get a noise and you'll get that feeling that you're percolating. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, percolating.  You know something's coming.  Yep.  Good guess.  Wow.  Don't look a doctor has solved yet another medical dilemma for this program.  Yeah.  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  Looking forward, I have a little spot in my wine closet just waiting for a bottle of Dr. Steve's best wine.  I think it will be ready to send up this week.  All right.  Actually, it's not my wine closet.  Sorry, it's my armory closet.  I want to use it as a Molotov cocktail in case of any break-ins. 
[01:37:30]  That's my last resort.  Just make sure the label looks really good so when I repackage it, people think I'm giving away good wine.  Molotov.  Thanks, Dr. Steve.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Bye.  He's a good egg vet, Dr. Steve.  Oh, we should have asked him about Paul Abdul's impacted colon.  Fuck.  Ah.  Here's another home run call from John Sterling.  That'll be an 0-1 to Teixeira.  Swung on, hit high in the air to right. 
[01:38:00]  That ball is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  Oh, Mark Teixeira sends a text message over the bullpen into the right field seats.  You're on a mark, Teixeira.  And Teixeira and Damon go back to back and a belly to belly.  And the Yankees take a 4-1 lead.  He fucking stinks.  Holy shit.  We had a back to back and a belly to belly.  Listen to how fucking shoehorned and, like, unnatural with the flow. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, that is fucking terrible.  He's just trying way too hard.  What was he text messaging?  Somebody text messaged?  You're on the Mark Teixeira.  Mark Teixeira.  What does that mean?  I don't...  His name.  Oh.  That's embarrassing.  It's so bad.  Does he just study the roster and try to come up with some fucking shit?  I bet he gets the roster.  He lays there in bed and just goes, what can I say about this guy? 
[01:39:00]  Do you think he has aha moments, too?  Like, aha!  Oh, I got this.  Wait till they hear this one.  You're this one, yeah.  Johnny Rocket.  Johnny Rocket.  He's fucking terrible, man.  It comes...  It's really simple.  If you can do it naturally, fine.  But when you start trying too hard and make it about yourself, that's where I have a problem.  And a belly to belly.  Oh.  Ooh.  Bernie goes boom.  Yeah, that was always a good one. 
[01:39:30]  Really?  Oh.  That's what Bernie did?  Where was Susan Waldman during that home run call?  I don't know.  Hopefully having her mouth dried out with a fucking tissue.  She's probably showing your godfather.  She puts Kleenex in her mouth.  Though apparently I'm leaking all over the goddamn microphone, John.  Like, your mouth is full of delicious liquid.  I eat French onion soup and I don't swallow it.  I keep it in my gums for flavor.  She must be a sloppy kisser.  Oh, she's awful.  But a nice... 
[01:40:00]  Probably a nice wet blowjob, right?  The last time I saw Natalie Ward, I kissed her.  No one's heard from her since.  Get it?  Get it.  I'd love to get it at the end.  Susan Smith threw a kid's in my mouth.  You should do a whole series of jokes that end with.  Get it.  One after another.  In other sports news, Eli Manning gets the big payday.  Yeah, huh?  More than his fucking year.  Oh, is that what they're saying?  Yes.  No shit. 
[01:40:30]  More than painting, yeah.  I don't think we have to play the audio.  Six years, 97 million bucks.  Million dollars, yeah.  Wow.  More than his brother.  And that's the big, you know, sports thing.  I don't know if he deserves to have as much more money than his brother does.  Is he really about as big a talent as his brother, even though he's got the Super Bowl win?  Anyone else notice that Mad Dog pulls his pants up way too high?  It makes very...  You gotta get your pants up high!  It makes everyone so uncomfortable when he's standing around. 
[01:41:00]  I like walking around with a little camel toe.  Here at our series.  They're pulled up way too high.  He's too young to have his pants up that high.  With a belt.  Always a belt and a tucked in shirt.  Mad Dog is a weirdo.  Weirdo.  He's a weirdo.  He's a nice guy.  And he knows everything about sports.  Oh, really?  He could quote stats from years ago.  Half the time I ask him about his sporting event, he goes, I didn't watch that. 
[01:41:30]  I'm like, you have to watch this stuff.  I'm not talking about modern sports that you're watching on television maybe this week.  I'm talking about stuff from probably 20, 30 years ago.  I could tell you the stats from those games.  He doesn't like the UFC.  Well, he doesn't understand or watch the UFC.  I don't get it.  What's that, a fence?  How could you fight with a fence?  It had to be ropes.  He doesn't watch the UFC.  He should get with that because he's going to sound very outdated.  Come on, Mad Dog.  And Fedor didn't sign with the UFC.  Dude, Strike Force.  And Dana White is out of his mind.  And he's going to be, I think, calling the show tomorrow finally. 
[01:42:00]  Dana White.  And Joe Rogan's going to be here tomorrow.  Dana offered.  I heard Dana offered Fedor everything he wanted except co-promotion with M1.  And that's just Fedor's management.  Which, maybe there's some dicey dealings there.  I don't know.  And what did I have to do with it?  Like, maybe the management, I don't know.  Terrible move by Fedor's people.  Fedor probably doesn't even understand what happened.  He thinks he's actually fighting for UFC.  Sure.  And he's like, what?  I don't blame Dana for not giving away the promotion either. 
[01:42:30]  He was going to really give him money, let him wrestle Samba, and he still didn't want  to come.  Amazing.  That's his people.  Yeah, you think?  I wonder.  Yeah, man.  Because they could probably bully Strike Force.  And look, let's just say, you know how casinos used to be run?  Where there were silent partners that, you know, maybe did things that they weren't supposed  to be doing?  And it probably is that way in other aspects of life.  And maybe certain fight groups.  It's obvious.  The UFC is the place to be.  Why wouldn't you want to fight the best fighters in the world?  Because you can't bully Dana in that arena, quote unquote. 
[01:43:00]  You can't make him do what you want.  Dana will have a lot to say about that tomorrow, certainly.  Hey, before we move on from John Sterling, you got Chris in Connecticut.  Chris?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I'm listening last night, and Sterling goes, Nick Swisher, home run, he's swishalicious.  Swishalicious?  He didn't say swishalicious.  Oh, you got it?  Swishalicious.  I think we have it from the last time he did that.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah, let's hear that. 
[01:43:30]  Thank you, Chris.  Swung on, and there it goes to deep right.  That ball is high.  And it is far.  It is gone.  Oh, Nick Swisher has driven a two-run home run to deep right center.  Why?  He's swishalicious.  His two-run blast gives the Yankees a 3-0 lead.  Why?  He's swishalicious.  You never should be calling another man swishalicious.  Swishalicious.  Ever.  How embarrassing.  That's embarrassing.  It really is. 
[01:44:00]  That's like the Yankees radio guy.  That's the fucking call you're going to play on ESPN?  Yeah.  That's embarrassing.  You're not a funny guy, John.  If you were the play-by-play announcer for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, that would fly, I  would imagine.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  But not for the, and I'm not even a Yankee fan, but not for the Yankees.  Not for the Yankees.  All that tradition.  Swishalicious.  Swishalicious.  Oh, there's another swish call he does.  Bleacher Anthony. 
[01:44:30]  Bleacher Anthony.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  We were talking about the roster, how he goes up and down.  And early in the season, he could not come up with anything for Nick Swisher.  So he came up with Swisher upon a star.  And he was so gay, he all had to come up with something else.  Swishalicious isn't as gay?  Swisher upon a star.  Swisher upon a star.  Yeah, it was awful.  I'm embarrassed, man, for him.  Yeah.  That's terrible.  That is really bad.  And one more.  Mike in Jersey.  Mike.  I won't heard John Sterling compare Greg Maddux to Bing Crosby for half an inning. 
[01:45:00]  Swear to God.  Why?  How did he compare the two?  He went out to explain it, but I don't even know.  It's too douchey to even explain.  Too douchey.  Yes.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Wow.  Why was he saying that Maddux would put on a sweater and drink and fucking hit his wife  with a bottle on Christmas Eve?  Wouldn't it be funny if Sterling was saying that?  He's just like Bing Crosby.  He knocked his wife's teeth out. 
[01:45:30]  Want to do a little break?  Yeah, sure.  Nick DePaul is going to be joining the program today.  Nice.  He canceled.  That's what I'm saying.  I just wanted to have breaking news, but I don't.  I'm kidding.  You made it up.  Yeah, Nick will come in all angry at me.  What the fuck?  People are going to turn it off.  Fuck.  Scream at me.  We're looking forward to seeing Nick.  Yeah, I haven't seen Nick in a while.  And Sandy Cain is coming in, you know, the cowgirl herself.  Good.  I miss her.  That's why I want to eat now.  And we found out that she was very traumatized by her last appearance.  Yes, apparently she's a little upset. 
[01:46:00]  We'll get into it after the break.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sam's got the scoop.  He talked to her.  Of course Sam's got the scoop.  But she's very traumatized by the last time.  Gossip Queen Sam.  She did our show.  That would be the guitar string incident.  Yes, and the turkey gravy.  The turkey gravy.  You all remember the guitar string turkey gravy incident.  I didn't know.  I forgot there was turkey gravy involved with that as well.  Yes, turkey gravy.  I forgot what it says.  I got E-Rock was there to lap it all up. 
[01:46:30]  Are we the biggest dicks or what?  Why would we throw turkey gravy on our guests?  Because it's Sandy Cain.  I'm a naked cowgirl.  No, you're not.  And why did we have turkey gravy just laying around?  Was it around Thanksgiving?  It might have been in E-Rock's condiment drawer that we've heard so much about.  His condiments.  God, you fool.  Oh, what a buffoon. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, he stinks.  He's of no value.  All right, we'll break.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton.  I want to know what's going on outside the studio today.  E-Rock came marching down the hall, grabbed Steve out of the studio, and there was a little  back and forth going on.  Uh-oh.  I wouldn't call it yelling, but E-Rock seemed very, very, what?  Pissed off, uptight.  What was going on, Sam?  Fighting over an elk carcass.  Why are they fighting? 
[01:47:30]  I don't know.  Bring E-Rock in here.  Why are they fighting?  And get Nick DiPaolo.  He's here, too.  They were fighting him out.  I'm playing QWERTY!  Sorry, Sam.  Go ahead, Sam.  I mean, I'm not 100% sure, but it seemed like Steve said we had some audio, and we didn't  have it, and he made Eric look like a boob.  What was the audio of?  Eric just talking?  What was the audio of?  I'm not quite sure.  How are you not sure of everything that's going on here, you little fucking gossip?  I haven't had time to find out yet. 
[01:48:00]  I will.  Oh, here's Steve.  Steve, what's going on?  Why isn't E-Rock in here?  He's probably taking a week.  I have no idea.  Oh, he's probably taking a leak.  Wow.  Wow, that's crazy.  Wow.  There's been farting going on in here.  What have I been missing?  Walking into a men's locker room here, Nick.  Nick DiPaolo joining the show.  No, it's not me, actually, Nick.  He's like an alcoholic.  He always denies it.  Well, are we going to get to the bottom of this, or what, as Nick gets comfortable?  No, honestly, it was a mountain out of a molehill.  Well, that's what E-Rock does. 
[01:48:30]  That's why I want to talk about this.  I was asking him for a piece of audio of Nick's that apparently we didn't have, so he was  getting upset that we didn't have it, and I was asking for it.  I'm still laughing at a mountain out of a molehill.  Who said that?  He told Steve.  He said, Steve, look, you were in the wrong this time, and Steve was trying to say, no,  I'm not.  Here comes E-Rock.  We'll just get the audio.  Now, here comes E-Rock.  E-Rock will spell it out.  E-Rock, what's going on?  This didn't need to be on air, but fine. 
[01:49:00]  How did it not need to be on air?  Because it...  All right.  We were supposed to...  You and Steve in a fight.  Why wouldn't we put it on the air?  Yeah, of course.  Why wouldn't it be on the air?  Because of what we were arguing about.  Haircuts?  Stupid.  Steve goes, hey, you know, we're going to bring Nick in.  Do we have any of Nick's comedy that we can play before he comes in to break?  All right, let me look.  We don't have his new CD, so I'm trying to write to Steve, I don't have his new CD. 
[01:49:30]  Steve goes, you want to come over here and look at some of these cuts, and do you want  to play some of this?  And Nick's yelling, this is my old stuff.  I gave you my new stuff.  I never saw the CD, otherwise we would have it.  He keeps telling me, we have it, I don't have it, and I'm trying to be nice in front  of Nick, like, we don't have the stuff, Steve.  And Steve starts going, well, come pick some of these things.  And I'm grabbing his hand.  I'm like, shut the fuck up.  And he gets, oh, man.  That's a E-Rock language.  So what happens?  Steve noticed that you have 40 mosquito bites on your right arm and wanted to know about 
[01:50:00]  your bed bug problem, and then you said we don't have Nick's new track.  Jesus, A's arm.  What the fuck?  What happened to you, Eric?  You all right?  You're supposed to shoot up on the other side.  You have a cat.  Are they flea bites?  No, they're cuts.  You have a cat or a dirty girlfriend.  So what happened?  We don't get to hear Nick's new stuff?  It came out after the fucking Beatles' White Album.  Don't worry about it.  Steve, comment?  I think I've handed you the physical copy three times. 
[01:50:30]  Of course you have.  It gets filed.  That's what I laugh about.  I want to know, Steve, how come you and your uncomfortably small tank top didn't fucking  file this before we could use it?  We didn't have the CD, and it wasn't a really big deal, to be honest with you.  And it was, Eric got very upset because we didn't have it right away, and I wasn't telling  him that we had it.  I was just trying to find an appropriately-  All right, E-Rock's shaking the head.  Oh, E-Rock's shaking the head.  No, because this conversation and what we were dealing with should not have been done in 
[01:51:00]  front of Nick since it was Nick's material.  It's pretty much saying, hey-  Who am I, Paul Anker?  You give a fuck.  That was my point.  It's not a big deal.  Hey, Nick, we don't have it.  Can you give me more kind of arguing with him?  We didn't care enough to save your CD.  We threw it out or something.  Guys, you said that would bother me.  That's not at all what I said, but-  No, I know it's not what you said, but it's what it's implying.  That, hey, he gave us his stuff last time.  We threw it out or something.  It wasn't worth saving.  I don't think you threw it out, but-  More importantly, where did you get the Superman shirt?  Yeah, let's move on to the-  That fucking shirt you're wearing.  Let's move on to the worst shirt ever.  It really is the worst shirt I've ever seen. 
[01:51:30]  And did you just see what Sam had to do?  I did not.  Sam had a point where it says the Man of Steel across the shirt.  You've got a Superman logo on the front of your shirt.  Yeah.  It's very subdued.  And then there's a lot of old Renaissance-y looking-  It's the fucking, you know what?  The Bill of Rights under the Superman logo.  That's what it looks like.  Okay, yeah.  The back of a Budweiser can.  Yeah.  It's exactly what it looks like.  It's fucking horrible.  It looks kind of like an Ed Hardy type shirt.  It doesn't make sense.  There's a biography of Superman written on the shirt. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, is there?  He was a fictional character in the fucking biography.  Why doesn't Eric take the shirt off and read it for us?  You know what, you rock?  God damn it.  If Sam didn't have the best idea I've ever heard.  Oh, Sam gets pushed.  Sam had a good idea.  You can't read it.  There's too many graphics and stuff all over it.  No, you can't.  Why are the words on it at all?  Look at how quickly Steve ran from the studio.  Of course he did.  When we didn't talk about him for two seconds.  What are you doing?  Going to re-tuff your hair under your hat?  That looks fucking awful.  Isn't it bad?  Sam has hair like a black maid. 
[01:52:30]  God damn Danny.  Put up a picture.  Who's that?  My shirt does not look like that.  No, that's funny.  He doesn't object to the face or the mentality.  Yeah.  It's a retarded boy with a Superman shirt on.  A Down Syndrome kid with a Superman shirt on.  And he said, that shirt doesn't look like that.  The man of steel between the ears.  The face.  I don't have a problem with. 
[01:53:00]  It's the shirt.  Yeah.  E-Rock, where'd you get the awful Superman shirt?  You know, retards do have the strength of like Superman.  They are like Superman.  Yeah.  That makes sense.  I bought it.  They just don't use it for good.  They use it to put a piano on the kitten.  Look, up in the sky, it's a bird brain.  Look, it's a bird.  It's a ball of lead paint chips.  It's trouble.  It's a bird.  It's a plane.  It's an extra chromosome.  There should be an X on that lousy shirt.  A fucking X.  E-Rock.  I like the shirt. 
[01:53:30]  E-Rock, comment.  You like that?  Please take it off and read it for us.  It's actually a good idea.  No, I can't read it.  Yeah, you can.  No, there's too many graphics.  Try it.  It's very legible.  Give it a try.  Nah, that's all right.  You can do it.  Nah, I can't.  For the show.  I can't read it.  It's all in cursive.  If Sam could read, like, one line, then you could read the whole thing.  Go ahead, Sam.  The one that says Man of Steel stands out.  No.  Fucking Sam.  Right down there.  See, it says, born Cal L. On.  Absolutely.  Very, very legible.  That's enough.  That's enough.  You could read it.  Now you gotta take it off and read it.  I think you should. 
[01:54:00]  No.  E-Rock, it's the show.  I'm not being videotaped for this.  No.  You know what I'm talking about.  There's no videotape for that.  Come on.  You look good.  I mean, he disrespected Steve.  He's the boss.  Somebody should be punished.  Oh, fuck Steve.  This is how we're gonna do it on air.  But Steve's never wrong.  You're obviously not here.  Really?  We all know that Steve's never wrong.  He's never here, either.  Oh!  Wow.  Wow.  Somebody needs to learn that there are repercussions to actions.  That's right.  Or repercussions.  Fucking Sam is the biggest instigating douchebag. 
[01:54:30]  I agree with Sam, though.  You should actually be reading your show.  Yeah, yeah.  I should be reading it.  I want to know what it says.  Take it off and read it.  No one's gonna laugh at you.  You look good.  You look like you're watching.  No, I don't want to be videotaped for this.  I'll do it.  Okay, don't videotape him.  Stop videotaping.  You're on a man of steel shirt.  Stop videotaping.  Exactly.  Man of steel shirt.  Fucking fine.  Looks like the ingredients on a Pringle can.  There you go.  Jesus, Sam.  Just laugh, Sam.  Let me know when Sam was the first to laugh at E-Rock with no shirt on.  Oh, thanks, pal.  Talk.  There we go. 
[01:55:00]  Fuck.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  He's fucking ripped.  Yes, he certainly is.  What are you living on, heavy cream and bacon?  Come on, he wouldn't get ripped even if he was doing that.  Okay.  I was trying to be an ironical.  Where are you going?  You gotta read it.  Don't put it on.  Read it.  The only sentence I can read is it says, born Kal-El on the planet Krypton.  I have to ask, why is it red under where your bosoms are? 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, what the fuck is that?  Honey, what happened?  Your tits are giving yourself a rash.  That's the bra marks.  Oh, shit.  That's what it looks like.  Is that an underwire?  What happened?  E-Rock rules.  What does his shirt say?  I love the fact that he just said, fuck Steve in the middle of this, by the way.  That made me very happy.  He's just grabbing at straws now.  Not really, man.  E-Rock knows how to fight back.  Why fuck Steve?  You've had it with him?  Because he was wrong.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He's pretty much saying it doesn't matter who the fuck the guest is. 
[01:56:00]  If we don't have his material, I'm like, we should have done this not near Nick.  And he's like, what's the big deal?  Well, I got to give that to E-Rock.  You probably wouldn't want to have that argument in front of Nick.  It makes Nick...  Nick, we're very embarrassed that we don't have your new material.  Nick doesn't give a shit.  I don't have any either.  We don't give a shit.  No one really cares.  We just like conflict between these guys.  If they had your new material, we'd be mad.  They had too many copies.  It was too...  There's no way.  Yeah.  I'm the one who yelled at him, though. 
[01:56:30]  I'm like, what the fuck?  I gave it to you last time.  And then Steve wants to go, oh my God, he's angry.  Yes.  But you've got to tell me.  I'm always like this.  Yeah.  You forgot your line, so Sharks is going to do it in Philly.  Oh, what happened?  Sharks, go ahead.  We said this line during the commercial, but go ahead.  All right.  I was going to say, just put the masking tape over and just put the man of meal.  Man of meals.  Yes, that was my line during commercials.  Let's go to Tommy in Indiana.  Tommy.  Hi, Tommy.  Welcome aboard, Tom.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks, Tom.  Today? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  You should be wearing the mayonnaise of steel shirt.  Mayonnaise of steel.  Yeah.  It's a million of them.  Thank you.  God, it was just your birthday a year ago.  More retards with Superman costumes.  Why do retards wear Superman shirts?  Iraq, comment?  Just wondering, because there's a lot of them on the internet.  How bad do you want to punch Sam right now, Iraq?  I'm fine with Sam.  All right, good.  Is that hysterical?  You like that one?  That's why I don't have kids.  What would you do if you had that?  Take that picture and post it.  I'd kill him. 
[01:57:30]  That's what the S's for, which was stupid.  Oh, God.  What a fucking laugh.  That was my own kid.  I'd have to take out of the yard and shoot it like a fucking horse.  Yeah, but they love him.  No, they're not.  They're going to shit on the couch.  Is he holding nunchucks?  Those are salt and pepper shakers.  No, they're dumb chucks.  Why does it look like he's...  Dumb chucks.  That's Mario Batali when he's going to cooking school.  Why does it look like there's a pancake on his head? 
[01:58:00]  Because there is?  That's the brain.  It looks boring on the outside.  It's all infected.  Fucking pancake brain.  Holy shit.  Poor fat little retarded kid.  Flattened by God.  And he's happier than any of us in this fucking room.  Of course he is.  Sure he is.  He's eating pine cones.  Choking a small child in the woods.  All he knows is how good cookies are and how much it hurts when he puts his finger in that thing in the wall. 
[01:58:30]  Extreme example.  Holy shit.  Can I see that picture again, please?  God bless us.  But he's like a bully retard.  You're going to hear about a girl getting molested at school.  Oh, absolutely.  It's going to be that guy.  He has a corny of...  Look at him.  Pancake on his head and a fucking weird mask.  He's got forearms like fucking Maguire.  Holy shit.  Look at those stubby fingers.  He's on the roids.  Yes.  Are we done making fun of you, Ron?  I'm not sure.  Anybody else you want to yell at, E-Rock? 
[01:59:00]  All right.  You're good with the fuck, Steve, and that's it.  What the fuck?  That guy.  You know, retards love Superman.  They sure do.  What is that?  Looks like Julio Lugo.  That's fantastic.  That looks like a Puerto Rican girl with a mustache.  You know what the S stands for in that.  Spoon.  Spoon.  Oh.  No?  Yes, I do.  I don't know. 
[01:59:30]  What are you saying?  Not Span.  Okay.  Oh, you guys.  And not Ghost.  Come on.  Now, now.  Sam, what else is going on?  Sandy Cain's had a problem with her last appearance, and she's coming in today?  Yeah.  I had to make like three trips to Times Square to talk to Sandy Cain about coming in today,  because she feels like you guys didn't really respect her the last time she was in.  We never have.  Is she a porn star?  Who is her?  She is, yeah, but she's just way treated bad. 
[02:00:00]  She used to work the peep booths and stuff.  She's like an old timer, man.  She's like an old vaudevillian fucking disgusting mess.  But she's doing this naked cowgirl thing.  Yeah, but meanwhile, the naked cowboy has a wife that does the naked cowgirl bit.  And she actually has a pretty nice body and wears pasties on her tits and shit like that.  Who, Sandy?  No.  The cowboy's wife?  Why was she traumatized?  Well, mainly what she didn't like was she was performing her new song, and you went over 
[02:00:30]  and took a pair of scissors and cut her guitar strings.  And then while you were apologizing, somebody came up from behind her and poured a jar of  turkey gravy on her head.  Then we stole her wig and cowboy hat.  What?  Then we had the interns pick up the chair that she was on and throw her out of the studio  like a piece of garbage.  But aside from that, what's the problem?  I don't know.  Do you know, in the Ukraine, throwing turkey gravy at a performer is a compliment. 
[02:01:00]  It is.  It's like applause.  That's right.  In the Ukraine?  Yes.  It is.  And she also-  Certain parts of the Ukraine.  Yes, so is serving a shit-kin-ish.  So she was traumatized by the experience.  And she also said-  Out of all the times she's been on the show getting abused.  She's trying to get away from all the sexual stuff.  She feels like she just comes in and shows twato and stuff, and she's not just about the  sexual stuff.  So what's she going to do now?  Write a book?  Oh, Nick DePaul's never seen twato, though.  That's true.  Nick, we got something for you today.  She's going to be like, I don't want to do that, man. 
[02:01:30]  She asked-  No, man.  Come on, man.  He's fucking handsome.  I'm fucking handsome, man.  Hey, Nick DePaul.  Oh, my God.  Nick DePaul.  I don't fuck him, man.  Man.  You want me to suck your dick, man?  Oh, God.  She is a fucking-  When is she going to be here?  Abomination.  She's supposed to be here-  I don't know, but get her in.  In 20 minutes or so.  You've got to see this one.  Oh, there she is.  There she is.  Oh, for Christ's sake.  I thought I was like, you fucking guys.  She's got a fucking-  She's parking her broom in a meter. 
[02:02:00]  That's a woman?  Isn't that ironic?  The wall she ran into is right behind her.  Exactly.  Back in 1950s.  That could be like Maya Blomberg.  It doesn't look like a fucking woman.  She told me that, like, one of the reasons she's so successful, because she said she's  doing very well in Times Square as a performing artist.  Uh-huh.  Performing what?  Filet show?  The dirty kind of-  No.  I mean, hi, how are you?  She's cute.  She said she talked to God about it, and God actually helped her find her calling. 
[02:02:30]  Where's he performing?  No.  They went to grammar school together, that old bitch.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  We're going to get into this with her today.  That's why she's performing outside, because she's closer to God.  There's no room.  Did she found Jesus?  You guys always have, like, hot broads in here and shit.  Always.  I know.  I come in and you fucking-  Where the fuck have you been?  Some mess.  Bring this octogenarian.  No?  No.  Not so much.  Not so much, Nick.  I don't know.  I don't even have a satellite.  We try.  There's a couple. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, right?  Fuck it.  I don't.  Not so much.  It doesn't come in and watch it.  No?  All right.  Most of us don't either, because they don't give it to us anymore.  Yeah.  That's not true, right?  It is true.  They're very strict.  I get a call every day.  Anthony, hi, it's Sal.  My radio stopped working.  It just sounds like one channel with the weather announcing over and over.  Can you get on the radio?  No, Sal.  They're not doing the free thing.  I'll buy you one and stuff.  No, I don't want to have your buy.  Just ask him. 
[02:03:30]  It's amazing.  Everybody.  Don't get us started.  We're having a good time today.  Yeah, exactly.  It's ridiculous how they run the marketing.  The marketing stinks.  It's horrendous.  Fucking marketing.  Hey, Squeaky Fromm.  Wow.  The fuck I want to shot Ford?  This is amazing.  Squeaky Fromm.  Back in the nose?  Yeah, she certainly is.  And back in society, apparently.  They fucking paroled that bitch after she shot the president?  There you go.  Oh, she didn't shoot him.  Well, no, she was trying.  Yeah.  She certainly tried. 
[02:04:00]  There you go.  Her best.  This is the story.  Give it a whirl.  It's very quick.  And a Charles Manson follower convicted of attempting to assassinate President Gerald Ford is about to be released from a federal prison.  Lynette Squeaky Fromm was 26 years old in 1975 when she pulled out a .45 caliber pistol and aimed it at the president.  Secret Service restrained the woman before any shots were fired.  Fromm, who is now 60, is scheduled to be released on parole August 16th.  I banged her in the old days. 
[02:04:30]  Hook her up with her.  You know what?  You know what?  Crazy broad.  We got to start somewhere.  Big red bush.  You know what that red bush must have looked like in the 70s?  Yeah, how about what it smelled like?  Oh, horrendous.  To where Manson was found hiding after the Tate murders.  Squeaky's fucking big red text.  Watson's boots were sticking out of her.  You can't parole someone to try to kill a president.  No, I agree.  Didn't she not run into the murders?  Why not?  It was a Republican.  You know how it is.  She's a woman.  I give up.  This country sucks.  Fucking doggy dick.  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah, what's your problem with the country these days, Nick? 
[02:05:00]  Oh, jeez.  Take a while, I guess.  Well, we know the big one.  We know the biggie.  No, everything's cool.  Everything's cool.  Yeah, the biggie.  We got another world around and what are you going to do?  How the fuck was she sentenced to life in prison?  I believe so.  How do you get out?  I believe so.  She served life?  Did she get life or did she get like 30 to life or something?  She got out because she's a...  Let me see a...  Okay, look.  A left winger and the trial lawyers. 
[02:05:30]  She looks kind of like you'd get one of those hippie blowjobs from her back then.  Mm-hmm.  That picture.  Now, where's the recent picture?  I gotta see what she looks like now.  Not quite looking like squeaky.  You got anything new?  Um, I haven't seen that.  I mean, because even that one to the left doesn't look new.  You know, Charlie...  Because it's black and white.  Charlie is so smart and Charlie...  What's she going to do?  Anyone associated with that piece of shit should just die in jail. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  He's all right.  I don't mean him.  She tried to assassinate the president.  Oh, oh, I gotcha.  Yeah, and then meanwhile, the guy that fucking...  What's his face?  That shot Reagan.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, Hinckley.  Yeah.  They're letting him, you know, go on little trips to his family and wander around.  Another, you know, Republican getting shot.  Yeah.  How the fuck does...  That doesn't make sense.  Yeah.  Well, fucking Oswald didn't make it a day. 
[02:06:30]  You know?  Not a day in the sunshine for that motherfucker.  And again, Oswald succeeded.  Well, true.  Plexiglas, what the fuck?  She shot the president.  She's out.  Yeah.  I'm going to go to fucking jail.  He's got to go in.  I shot myself.  He's got to do two years, it looks like.  Wow.  What a fucking disgrace.  Looks like he's got to do two.  Two fucking years.  That's a mandatory sentence.  Yeah.  But it's still two years.  Mandatory sentences.  Good.  Oof.  Good.  Wow.  Nicky. 
[02:07:00]  Nicky's in the house.  Good.  Good.  You're telling me your parents should have went with him.  What, you're going to hide a fucking weapon?  But if you did that, you'd go to fucking jail.  No, I wouldn't.  Why not?  I would ask not to.  Why can't some of the brothers buy a holster?  Buy a fucking holster.  That's where the gun goes.  Not in front of your fucking pants.  With an elastic waistband.  Yeah, with the elastic waistband.  Got to waste eight, three, five pounds.  Yeah.  What an ass.  They don't really ruin it all, man.  Yeah, what happened? 
[02:07:30]  It's all cocked and ready to fucking go.  Like, it just...  Hey, don't wear $100,000 worth of bling when you fucking leave the house, you mama luke.  You fucking half a dink.  Yeah, actually, a guy with that kind of money could have just hired a security guard.  He could hire a cop or hire a fucking armed guy.  Yeah, it's about carrying the gun.  They fucking love, they live for this shit.  Now he's a fucking...  I gotta tell you.  Now he's legitimized.  Legitimized, he's going to jail.  He's losing a lot of money.  That's pretty fun, but you know, he's got to be licensed.  He's got street cred.  Yeah, he'll make it up by going on, you know, Jamie Foxx show. 
[02:08:00]  What?  That's pretty funny.  We missed that one.  What?  The manatee of steel.  Poor Iraq just trying to help the show.  He gets killed for 20 minutes.  Able to almost leap hopscotch boards.  Get it?  Because he's too fat to lift his legs.  Of course he is.  Oh, boo.  It is a phrase I've never heard.  Hopscotch board.  Whatever it is.  Making chalk on the street.  Oh, I don't know.  Back in like 1930.  What do they call it? 
[02:08:30]  I still play hopscotch.  Do you?  I do.  And double dutch.  Tee.  And pick-up sticks.  We're going to take a break.  Why are we?  Because we're going to get ready for a St. King's appearance.  I'll do some more pick-up sticks jokes.  Is that dry up?  Nick DePaul is going to be at the comedy shop.  Where's this, Nick?  I don't know.  Some restaurant on Route 46?  For real?  Yeah.  16 Route 46 West.  16 Route 46.  Pine Brook, New Jersey.  Yeah.  And doing a benefit for the Pauling Fire Department on the 20th.

You go to NickDip.com for more info on that.  The Paul Lind Fire Department?  What is that?  Pauling.  Oh.  They put the fire out with cum.  Which they spit on the fire.  Well, I guess I'm just different.  Nick was cracking us up about movies.  Nick has made us very aware of what's going on in this country as far as men go. 
[02:10:00]  Well, as far as the media goes and TV shows and movies.  We're all over that.  Big time.  It's all for fucking gay guys and fucking, let's go see P.S. I Love You.  What the fuck?  Yeah, yeah.  The media.  There's a movie out now about a woman who fucking goes through a Julia Chow cookbook and tries  to make every recipe?  Yeah, let me get the tickets to that piece of shit.  How the fuck?  Who's going to go see that?  And when you brought this up, Anthony goes, I saw the preview two or three times. 
[02:10:30]  I still don't understand or get it.  I don't quite get it.  Because as you said there, you at least want to go, well, what the fuck are they trying  to say or what's this about?  And I don't know.  It's like, here's something guys won't ever fucking pay to see.  That's what it's about.  What this fucking, there's nothing on for guys.  TV.  Now they got women in law enforcement of Broward County on TLC.  That's a good show.  That's a mature way of going through life.  Breaking it down into gender channels and shit, huh?  That's a good way to look at life.  What they've done.  Wait.  And this shit head of a president's only going to endorse this type of stupidity. 
[02:11:00]  Here comes the official.  His fucking identity politics.  Here's the official trailer.  That's Meryl Streep.  Who's a brilliant actress.  She is.  Julia Child was just an American living in France.  Okay.  She never looked that good either.  What is it that you really like to do?  Eat.  And we were so good at it.  Look at you.  Oh, that's fascinating shit.  This is such great dialogue.  Isn't this terrific?  What does Julia Child have to do with me?  Okay, then we're going to find out.  Lowly cubicle worker, Julie Powell. 
[02:11:30]  So how's your job, Julie?  Look at this.  Are you the person to speak to about my insurance form?  You can speak to me.  Do you have any power?  No.  Heartbreaking.  So sad.  Painful.  Not in a bad way.  I don't know.  Is this lost?  Is this lost?  If you met me, would you think that woman is lost?  I would think that woman is strangely repetitive.  Wow.  This is funny dialogue.  Wow, that's fucking snappy shit.  I could write a blog.  I have thoughts.  Write a blog about cooking.  I'm not a real cook like Julia Child. 
[02:12:00]  Julia Child wasn't always Julia Child.  Why don't I go to cooking school?  Bonjour.  Isn't this fucking riveting?  Even for a woman.  Julia slash Julia project.  I cook my way through Julia Child's cookbook.  What happened?  365 days, 524 recipes.  And I like cooking.  I like Julia Child.  Me too.  And I still wouldn't see it.  Is it crazy?  Yes.  Fuck, I won't cook them.  You should have seen the way those men looked at me.  But then they just got it.  Then you're going to work the sexist angle, Anthony. 
[02:12:30]  Even back then.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You make it sound so simple.  Ah, the lid popped off the fucking...  It's going to change the world.  The lid almost hit her in the face.  This is a good movie for fucking chicks.  Why don't we have female theaters and male theaters?  Can we fucking just separate this shit?  It's supposed to be a big adventure, but it just turns out to be a lot of meltdowns.  Yeah, there's all of this stuff on the floor.  And they'll still work the man's an asshole into it. 
[02:13:00]  Of course.  A broad.  That's what this should be called.  A broad.  A broad.  A broad.  A broad.  A broad.  And the movie poster should be a fist.  A crying face over a pot of meatballs.  A celery chopping twatting.  I can't wait until the sequel.  A black eye.  Cook broad.  Yes.  The sequel is Never Let It Get Cold Again.  Do you see what I'm saying?  What the fuck?  I...  I...  I...  Julia and Julia.  That's good.  It's like they took two movies.  Right. 
[02:13:30]  Two shitty chick flicks and smashed them together.  And that's what this is supposed to be?  This makes Sex and the City look like platoons.  Shit.  What the fuck?  Who is that for?  I...  Yeah.  Really?  What really...  What is the audience there?  Old ladies.  I honestly think it looks good.  I mean, it looks like a lot of fun.  You and a bunch of the gals go together.  Is that it, Jim?  You like it?  Yeah.  It's like, what happens?  Does she cook all the rest?  She's laying on the floor.  She's like, oh, there's stuff on the floor.  You're like, oh, God, what's next?  What does she drop the pasta? 
[02:14:00]  The part Nick liked where the pot hit her in the face.  I noticed Nick was just laughing at that.  The lobster kicked the pot.  Yeah, yeah.  And almost hit her in the face.  That's funny.  And then she's cooking, right?  And her husband flips the table and goes, you called those carrots?  Oh, it's like a piece of charcoal.  Bring it over.  Wouldn't that be great if the whole movie turned out to just be domestic violence jokes  where she didn't cook good?  Yeah, now that would be a good movie.  The fucking husband throws hot grease in her face?  Yeah.  We'd line up to see that. 
[02:14:30]  He beats her clit with a rolling pin because the tomatoes are too mushy.  I mean, yeah, I can't wait to see how she makes a perfectly good fucking roast chicken.  I'm sitting on the edge of my seat.  What the fuck?  You know there's going to be like that thing.  She's going to be doing the recipes and then she's going to fuck them all up and everything.  And then she's going to get this inspiration.  And finally, she'll open up the top of a pot or open the stove and it'll be perfect.  And the play, the music and her emasculated fucking husband, neutered boyfriend, husband,  whatever he is, is going to come out and give her that confidence she needs. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  She's going to make a pie out of man balls at the end.  She's just perfect.  The fucking eunuch she's sleeping with.  There's a montage.  Like in Rocky, they show her grating cheese to fucking Bill Conti music and chop an onion.  You can just see the faggotry dripping out of it.  Well, the husband finally admits it's the best fondue he's ever had while a gentleman  of color is slamming his asshole.  That's my favorite phrase.  Oh, you...  Let's go...  I'm trying to stay away from that. 
[02:15:30]  I've done enough damage to my career.  We had a woman that wanted to defend other women and she says she doesn't go to the  chick flicks.  All right.  Guys.  Someone's calling these fucking things.  They keep pumping them out.  I don't really...  So you're the one.  Thanks for calling in.  I don't really...  Is that the chicks on the movie?  Oh.  Let's go to Mac in Babylon.  Mac.  Mac.  How's it going, fellas?  Hey, well, I'm sorry.  What's going on, Mac?  Mac.  Nick, I'm so happy that you're bringing all this stuff up.  If you guys haven't seen Nurse Jack yet on Showtime, holy cow.  Is it bad?  Is it bad? 
[02:16:00]  I mean, I noticed the first couple of episodes that they were very anti-white male, but just  recently there was a show...  I think Steve Buscemi played a homeless guy.  He was screaming out of his apartment window.  Yeah.  And Nurse Jackie comes out and starts yelling at him, saying, you know, why don't you yell  at criminals or drug addicts or white guys?  You know, something along those lines.  Is that a positive white male on the show?  You know, the only good guys are the gay minorities.  Of course. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  The doctor who's giving out prescriptions illegally.  The white male doctor is a goofball.  Of course.  I think Showtime is a fucking politically correct place.  Because didn't they have some show about the cell where it was terrorists, but they wouldn't  just paint them as Islamic fundamentalists?  Yes.  Right, right, right.  They had to have white guys and black guys.  Yes.  Like, that's the way...  They wouldn't just say that the Muslims are the ones who are committing...  Diversity is in terrorism.  You've got to know who runs the fucking...  What their agenda...  People don't understand who runs Hollywood and what they're...  And they're fucking out...  They're past liberal.  They're ultra-liberal fucks who really think the only, you know, white guys got by on 
[02:17:00]  a fuck...  It was all rigged for us.  It was rigged.  I'm watching fucking HBO.  Like, you know, there's 19 HBOs.  I'm flipping through.  I see an animated cartoon.  This is a couple weeks ago.  And it's called Whitewashed.  So I hit the info button to see what it's about.  It's a half hour.  It's on the family...  HBO Family Channel.  This is what the fucking explanation of the cartoon was.  A small black girl and her brother are attacked by white males on the way home from school. 
[02:17:30]  Are you shitting me?  White thugs.  Excuse me.  That was what it said on the info button.  I fucking hit it twice.  I thought I was singing things.  Has that ever happened?  It has.  Well, of course.  It was a comedy.  That's what you're forgetting.  That's the beautiful part.  It was a funny cartoon.  And that's the thing.  It wasn't a fucking comedy.  It was his...  And this is for...  This is for kids.  For kids.  But it kind of doesn't happen that way.  It never...  It happens the other fucking way.  It doesn't happen that way.  And let me make that cartoon, you liar motherfuckers.  Yeah, try to make that cartoon.  All right.  We got Alicia.  I'm at home right now.  Are you drawing? 
[02:18:00]  We got it.  Sketching one frame at a time.  We got a phone call for Nick.  Alicia from Jersey.  Alicia.  Hi.  Hello, Alicia.  How are you?  I'm good.  How are you?  Very good.  I just don't understand why you're so angry about the Julia and Julia movie.  You don't?  You're right.  Why is he angry?  What are you saying, Alicia?  Because we don't get it.  You don't understand why any woman would go and see that horse shit.  But Alicia, you think Nick's angry?  No, that's not even the point.  The point is, Alicia, when did movie making become like segregated?  Yep.  I mean, you know what I mean? 
[02:18:30]  They clearly made that going, you know what?  Fuck, we don't care if a guy's going to see this.  Yeah.  Who the fuck is going to see that?  Right.  So that's okay, right?  No, it isn't.  Quit looking at life through fucking gender and race.  I think you're making this into more than it really is.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Well, maybe you've got a point.  You know what?  I think she's changed my mind.  It's a small symptom of the bigger problem.  I think Alicia's making a very good point, and Nick should really listen.  He's learned something today.  Do you think Nick's too angry about it?  It's a coffee.  I really do.  I think that he's going to, you know, this is going to have ill effects on his health. 
[02:19:00]  That's a coffee.  Alicia, I've had like four cups.  I am going a little nuts here.  But don't you see my point?  Who the, I mean, who is that for?  I don't, it's, we're looking at everything through, you know.  And it's also a rip off.  Of a vagina.  Of a vagina colored glasses.  Yeah.  I mean, who the fuck?  A kaleidocunt.  Even gay guys are going to go, I wouldn't go see that.  It's too faggy.  No, no.  That was.  I got to be honest.  I mean, I like all kinds of movies.  And I might sit, when my husband's not home, I might sit and watch that movie. 
[02:19:30]  I wouldn't go pay to see that movie, but there's a lot of movies I wouldn't go pay to see.  But what's the coolest movie you saw?  Like something that would impress us in this studio right now?  Oh, Hellboy was awesome.  There you go, Hellboy.  I loved Hellboy.  But, you know, last night, what did I watch last night?  It's got the word boy in it.  I can't even remember what the hell I watched.  It was some chick flick last night.  And I just enjoyed watching that.  I don't know.  It's a matter of, Miss, you're saying there's a lot of movies you wouldn't go pay to see,  but that's what a movie's supposed to be, something people would go pay to see.  Yeah.  Well, I'd pay to see it on TV.  Why is it going to be a chick? 
[02:20:00]  But, Alicia, why do we have chick flicks and guy flicks?  And when did that fucking happen?  That's right.  They didn't have that in the 50s, 60s, and 70s, because we were all one.  That's right.  Now it's flaming homos that run the fucking business.  And they're trying to shove it down our throat.  Couples went to go see Gone with the Wind.  Yes.  Let's go see P.S. I Love You.  My first date was to Freebie and the Bean.  The Great Santini.  What girl didn't love that?  Who didn't get a blowjob after the Great Santini to drive in?  Freebie and the Bean.  That's the first dish she's making in this one. 
[02:20:30]  Who didn't get their ass eaten to the professionals?  Fucking.  The French connection.  These are things that men and women could enjoy.  Absolutely.  All right.  It's a female revolution, man.  And it's gay fucking guys in Hollywood.  We got Corey that has the other side of this.  Poor white man.  Corey in Virginia.  Corey.  Happy birthday, James.  Thank you, Corey.  Hey, I had to defend a couple of shows.  Eastbound and Down on HBO.  That's definitely not politically correct and hilarious.  Wait a minute.  What makes it not? 
[02:21:00]  I haven't even seen it.  Eastbound and Down is great.  But what makes it not politically correct?  What makes it not politically correct?  Do they make fun of minorities in it?  They make fun of everybody.  Do they make fun of minorities?  Give me an example.  They make fun of minorities and gay people.  Give me an example.  Oh, gay people.  That's fucking really edgy.  Do they make fun of fucking black people?  Yes.  They do?  Give me an example.  I think the first 10 minutes of the first show, he talks about going to play for one  of the teams in, what, Miami. 
[02:21:30]  It says, well, I thought the blacks were bad down here, but it's not as near as bad as  the fags in San Diego.  Yeah, that's it.  It's going after fags.  That's not a black joke.  Nice try.  Yeah.  Eastbound and Down, I like them.  I'm sure it's fine.  I'm just saying.  There's such a fucking double standard out there.  Does Rescue Me go after minorities?  I think I've never watched it.  No.  Do you know, Colin, Colin raised a point to me.  We were talking, it was one of our awkward walks home after a Brooklyn Diner thing where 
[02:22:00]  he wants, he's so fucking lonely.  He doesn't sit in the park.  What are we fucking, what are we, a fucking Mathow movie, you asshole?  Go home.  Fucking zilch.  You fucking lonely idiot.  I'm not James Gardner.  I don't want to fucking sit with you and fucking reminisce.  And he said he was watching Law & Order and he was up to a hundred episodes and there  was, he had found in Law & Order in a hundred episodes, two white, two black criminals in  a hundred episodes of Law & Order.  No, that's impossible.  Yes.  Bullshit. 
[02:22:30]  It's not impossible.  Are you kidding me?  Not impossible.  I don't doubt it.  He said even the rapper, even the rapper, this is awful, Colin, he said even the rapper  that shot somebody was a white rapper.  Get the fuck out of here.  He said Law & Order.  It's true.  Why are you arguing?  You can look this shit up.  I'm just playing the other side of this to make it more dramatic.  You know what you're doing?  That was my role in this thing.  You don't, you don't watch the fake fucking shows.  Don't you listen to our show?  You turn on.  No, I don't.  You turn on First 48.  It's too racist for me.  I know, no saddle.  You turn on First 48, which is one of my favorite shows.  That's the first 48 hours.  That's right.  And every single episode, it's the same thing. 
[02:23:00]  Boo got shot and then they got to bring in, they got to bring in fucking Peaches as the  witness and then they go to, you know, this one and that one and then Hamburger  comes in and they got nicknames.  They all got nicknames.  And the funny thing is that my favorite part of that show that I think doesn't get as  much attention as the fact that a lot of people are African-Americans on the, on the  program, the, the, the, the victims and the perpetrators.  But, but no matter what name anyone gives them, they go to the computer and go, and bam, if 
[02:23:30]  that fucking mugshot doesn't pop up, no matter who they're talking about.  But the point, and people will point to that to go, see, that's not politically correct,  but, but no, that's reality.  It's reality.  You can't fuck that up.  It's real.  I'm talking about fictional shows.  Yeah, yeah.  But something like that, they can't fuck up.  My buddies are copped out of Miami for 25 years now.  Every week they used to post the top 10 wanted criminals in, in, in Miami. 
[02:24:00]  And, uh, they were always, uh, it was 10 Hispanic names.  So they stopped doing it.  How is that responsible?  Well, because you know what?  It makes it, it look bad for the, for the good.  We're hard working.  So all reasoning and logic is gone.  We got eastbound and down, uh, defenders.  Let's go to Jay in Brooklyn.  I'm sure it's great.  Hey guys.  As far as the minority thing goes, Nick, that other guy, uh, couldn't really think of anything  good.  Jay might have an example.  Welcome aboard, Jay.  There was one episode where Danny was working at the, uh, the white guy's auto shop and the 
[02:24:30]  owner of the auto shop brought in.  The owner, Will Ferrell.  Right.  Jesus.  He brought in, um, this black star hitter and Danny had to pitch to him and he, he knocked  his fucking eye out.  So the white guy was a bad pitcher?  No, no, no, no, but he was making fun of this nigger.  Oh, geez.  You can't talk like that.  Oh, he can't.  This is why, you know, there's one way to put it. 
[02:25:00]  I don't like that talk.  And then there's another way to put it.  See, that's why I try to, uh, you know, I like to talk about this stuff, but they take  it there.  Now we're going to the law and order again.  And then it takes your, it takes your point and valid point that you're trying to make  and it puts it into this, uh, just racist bin that it has to reside in now because,  uh, somebody calls up and uses your harsh language like that.  Let's, let's go to the, uh, Keith in Atlanta.  Keith.  Yeah, man.  What's up, fellas? 
[02:25:30]  How y'all doing?  Pretty good.  What's up, Keith?  Hey, Keith.  Okay.  Well, Ant, I just wanted to thank you, man, cause I've been watching the first 48 like  you was talking about.  Yeah.  Great show.  It's a great show.  There's a criminal on there.  It's black and they're snitching.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  He's missing the part.  I mean, it can't, it's gotta be called out.  Everybody's snitching.  Every criminal is black and I can't believe they catch them in 48 hours.  It's amazing.  Well, yeah, sometimes they don't, but most of the time they don't.  Well, I'm sure the ones that don't catch it in 48 hours, they just don't show on TV.  But you realize they are black.  Our point is that they really are black.  It's not, it's not the writers being racist. 
[02:26:00]  You get it?  Well, I'm like this.  And on Law and Order, I'm a big fan of that too.  Of course you are.  And to say that it's only, you only sound like.  Not the real Law and Order, the show.  Black criminals in Law and Order.  No, no, I'm only telling you.  No, no.  What I'm telling you is Colin had watched X amount.  I'm not saying that was for the whole series, but he said he noticed in about 100 episodes  two like black criminals.  And as you say that, we just got a link on Instant Feedback, Danny.  Only Law and Order mugshots, Colin Quinn is right.  They do a whole montage of all the mugshots that we're on. 
[02:26:30]  I mean, I watch it every day.  And I'm like this.  Seven days out of the week, at least six of them days, it's a black criminal.  And that show that they were talking about the rapper.  Not on Law and Order.  No, not on Law and Order.  What's that?  The rapper was black.  What's that?  And that show you were saying, well, you know what?  You know what I'm saying?  A hip-hop guy killed somebody.  Well, he wasn't white.  He was black.  I've seen that episode.  Hell, I got it on DVD.  There might have been another one.  I'm just telling you.  Yeah, there's been two, Keith, out of 100 episodes.  There's been more than 100 Law and Orders, too, right? 
[02:27:00]  Wow, look at this.  Look at this.  That's what I'm saying, Uppy.  I love 100 episodes.  We're looking at the Law and Order.  Look at the Law and Order Most Wanted.  Okay?  Let's add them up.  It looks like a goddamn Utah choir.  There's one black face.  One black out of the first 20.  One.  Hey, actually, Law and Order SVU has more white criminals because for some odd reason, they're  sexually based.  You can get them.  It doesn't matter why.  By the way, it doesn't matter why.  Go down.  I think I saw something.  Now it's the real New York's most wanton. 
[02:27:30]  Now it's the real New York's most wanton.  The real most wanton.  How did they do this?  This is unbelievable.  And there's maybe two.  Out of 20, there's about four white guys.  Yeah.  Maybe five.  See, that's the reality of it.  Is it Keith?  Yeah.  It's just the idea.  It's not that they all have to be black.  But what happens is it shows elitist white thinking.  When you go so far in a direction to deny what is realistic, you're white people who are 
[02:28:00]  trying so hard to hide the way you feel superior to blacks because you're not being honest.  Oh, no.  It's always us who are bad.  It's like the self-hatred is based in being arrogant and elitist.  It's not based in being caring or having feelings for black people.  It's extraordinarily fucking pompous and ivory tower.  It's a little of both.  Thank you, Keith.  We got a guy that's very excited to see.  Julie, Julia.  Ooh.  Julie and Julia.  Steve C.  You're on the air.  Yes. 
[02:28:30]  Ryan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, Ryan.  You really want to see this movie?  I really do.  I have great hopes for it.  Why?  Ryan, why?  Why?  I am hoping that it inspires my wife to cook something other than the cardboard she serves  every night.  That's funny.  Oh, so maybe it will teach women to cook.  But you don't have to go see it.  Inspire them?  You know, she doesn't have to go through the whole cookbook like in the movie, but maybe  try one or two chapters.  Who wants to fucking go see that?  I don't know. 
[02:29:00]  I don't know.  You see Meryl Streep putting your 80-year-old hand up a chicken's asshole?  It should be terrific.  I think it's old women that are going to see this.  And I like cooking.  Like, even a young broad ain't going to go see this movie.  Nick, I have a George Foreman grill, and I wouldn't know it if you introduced me to it.  I love my wife.  Ryan, good for you.  You love your wife.  Ryan, take it easy.  Well, that explains why you get high hopes for this faggy movie.  She sounds like a real saint on earth.  Why don't you put your cock on a panini maker?  I bet you it'll be good. 
[02:29:30]  If she learns something, that'll be good, you know?  Yeah.  You should take her with porn flick.  She can learn something there, too.  It'll be a big night.  Is there a movie called Granola that is coming out?  Yes.  Granola?  It's about Jeanine Garofalo's twat.  Because someone said, you've got to show the trailer to Nick for Granola.  I think it's Granola.  Let's see it.  Let's see it.  Yeah, we were doing this the other day with the really horrid movie posters and trailers  where it's the guy and the girl, and they're standing back to back, and the guy's kind of 
[02:30:00]  looking like, I'm getting away with murder, huh?  And the girl's looking like, you're not getting away with anything, huh?  I'm on to you.  And they hate each other, and then by the end of the movie, they fell in love and realized  how they have, but the whole movie is a constant battle.  But the movie poster and the cover to the friggin' DVD and everything is just back to  back.  Maybe the guy's got his arms crossed, looking over his shoulder, and I'm like, you think  you're going to control me?  And the girl's got his tie or something, pulling his fucking tie going, I got you, my friend. 
[02:30:30]  Yes.  It's actually a little, it's kind of veiled violence, like a subtle violence.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's always a guy getting a drink in the face, kneading the fucking balls.  Yeah, yeah.  It's fucking relentless.  It's fucking relentless.  Somebody help me, because I want to put together, I really do, but you need permission to take  clips off TV and shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I could run a thousand commercials.  How about the one when the fucking cap rug was breaking into the house for the alarm system  company?  Oh, my God.  Here's where you can actually do a race neutral thing, have the guy have a ski mask on, like 
[02:31:00]  a lot of burglars do, then you wouldn't have to know the race.  But they go out of their way to zoom in on the white face.  It's fucking hilarious.  It's always a white guy that burks in the house for the breaks.  Because, again, that's that elitist, phony empowerment.  It's a phony sense of bone throwing.  It's based in fucking complete fucking guilt and arrogance.  Complete arrogance.  I love that.  You hear the whip, whip, whip, whip.  And it's like, Mrs. Johnson, are you okay?  Someone broke into my house, but it's okay. 
[02:31:30]  He was a white guy.  You don't have to show off.  They show a guy kicking the door on the snow line.  Yeah, the guy kicks in the door.  It's like an ex-boyfriend or something.  Yeah, that's the stalker boyfriend.  The crazy white guy.  Yeah, crazy white guy.  And I'm not saying that shit doesn't happen.  Oh, yeah.  But just go on the FBI fucking...  I got friends in law enforcement.  Just go on the FBI fucking website.  You want to look up statistics that'll refute all this whole shit?  That's all I'm saying.  Just throw one in.  Just fucking run.  Yeah, and the way Idi Amin kicks the front window in.  Yeah.  And he's got a fucking shovel.  You know when you see a lot of black people in commercials now is the perfect families. 
[02:32:00]  They are...  What are you kidding me?  Every...  They're the black father, the black mother.  And she's like, I cook all day.  And when my husband gets home from work and my kids get home from school, I have to give  him something good and hearty.  That's why I give him, and then insert shitty product here.  But it's this great house, great life.  And I'm not saying that doesn't exist.  I'm just saying... 
[02:32:30]  A little balance is all I'm asking for.  Blitz it out.  That's all.  And have that...  Yeah.  Maybe you could go both ways.  Make the guy kicking the door in a black guy, and then have the white family maybe, you  know, well to do.  It's just hilarious.  And the white family always has a black friend.  Oh my God.  Every single time.  They gotta point out.  I saw an Olive Garden commercial.  They do hang out with black people.  That's hysterical.  This girl goes, my boyfriend's meeting my friends for the first time, so I wanted to  go somewhere special. 
[02:33:00]  So we went to the Olive Garden.  She sits this boyfriend down at this table with a Benetton ad.  It was the Asian woman, the black guy.  A Mexican on a donkey.  There's like a Hispanic girl.  Indian with a full headdress.  The village people, that's who I hang out with.  Yeah.  Exactly.  And then this poor guy sits down going, I am never going to be able to tell this bitch  a joke.  Exactly.  Ever.  Eight of your friends walk into a bar.  One falls to the...  Hey, let's not forget about The Wire, though.  They did... 
[02:33:30]  They played it the right way.  Yeah, and you know what the...  And the problem is, it's a great show that no one wanted to acknowledge.  It didn't win any real awards.  No Emmys for the writing or the acting because they fucking portrayed it realistically, and  they fucking...  It was too realistic.  It was too realistic.  There you go.  The Wire was an amazing show.  The Wire did it right, though.  It made the cops look good and bad.  It made everybody look...  It was black-on-black crime.  It was fucking...  It had everything.  They showed good white cops.  They showed dirty black cops.  They showed dirty white...  It was just great, man.  But even like The Sopranos, my favorite show ever, Tony never used the N-word. 
[02:34:00]  Not once.  Really?  Yeah, I know.  A mobster from New Jersey never used the fucking N-word.  That's...  Is that true?  Yes, it's fucking true.  Yeah, that would have been flying out of his mouth.  They didn't even just throw it out there one time.  Not out of him.  They had like a white suburban guy whose car got ripped off.  Sure, sure, sure.  And he went effing meh.  Yeah.  But I'm just saying, when infuriate...  A lot of people don't pick up on this because they don't know the agenda of the people that  make this shit.  Like Jimmy said, fucking elitist, guilty white fucks.  Yeah.  And you know, my family thinks I'm not...  I go, you don't know who makes this shit.  I've been on auditions.  I've met them.  They're scared white people who think they know better than you. 
[02:34:30]  And if you don't know that...  And they're very slick about it.  Yeah.  You know, they're very slick how they do this shit.  Yeah, yeah.  But I did like other Sopranos once.  Yeah, the suburban couple gets their SUV ripped off by these black guys.  And the white suburban guy with the glasses goes, effing...  You know, he says the N-word.  Yeah.  You know, and the wife goes, Barry, that's horrible.  And he's like, well, who else then?  Who else?  And it cuts to Tony Soprano looking at cars and stolen pictures of stolen carts.  Yes, because that's where he's getting his stolen cars from. 
[02:35:00]  So it was a nice shot at us Italians, which I fucking love.  Yeah, of course.  Because it's true.  Yes.  I'm not going to fend it over.  That was a perfect segue.  I had no problem with that show.  Doug has a comment for you, Nick.  Doug in Philly.  Yes, Doug.  You guys are a bunch of paranoid faggits.  No, you're just stupid.  Hey, I'm not paranoid.  Exactly.  I like cock once in a while, but I don't think people are out to get me.  All right, please explain yourself, Doug.  Anyways, anyways.  Slow down, Doug.  What I'm trying to make the point is, who gives a shit if they're black or white? 
[02:35:30]  Yes.  Who gives a fuck?  Right.  Because if it portrays...  Who gives a fuck?  Who gives a fuck?  Because if we portray a black in a bad light, you're going to hear about it.  Somebody white's going to get fired.  I'm just asking for the fucking same rules for everybody.  That's who gives a fuck.  It's a TV show.  It's a TV show.  It's a TV show that affects people.  TV affects people's behavior.  You understand?  Man, that's how Barack...  That's how Obama got elected by dumb fucking white people like you. 
[02:36:00]  It's dishonest.  I'm not fucking nuts.  You don't know the agenda of the people that make this shit.  The agenda.  I just sit home.  I go home, put on TV for 30 minutes, and jerk off.  Thank you very much.  That's my point.  Can I ask you a question?  Good man.  Can I ask you a question, sir?  As an entertainer, this is why Nick is complaining.  As an entertainer, you're in a business where you're dealing with it, and if you wind up  on the wrong side of the issue, or if you're speaking out of the wrong side of your mouth,  you get in a lot of shit, and you can get fired for it. 
[02:36:30]  And since the rules are very arbitrarily kind of meted out, it gets to be frustrating.  It's not paranoia, but you learn that you suffer certain consequences that other people  don't suffer.  Okay.  Well, on the reverse side, you're also a white dude.  You're saying they're only hiring white guys for these gigs.  How come you still can't get a job, Jim, in acting?  That's what I don't understand.  Sweetie, I just did two acting gigs.  Why do you think Jimmy wasn't here on the show?  My lack of acting jobs is due to my lack of ability.  It has nothing to do with the business.  I can't blame that on anyone but my own maker. 
[02:37:00]  But my point is, Dougie, that TV and movies affect people.  That's why people spend billions of dollars on advertising.  You understand?  It affects people's behavior.  It makes you go out.  And that's what the media is for.  So, I mean, if you're exposed to lies day after day after day, it has consequences in  real life.  Hey, Doug, did you get a job on radio again, by the way, sir?  What?  Okay, nothing.  Well, anyways, I think it's upset.  I think you guys should just channel your hatred towards something else. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, it's hatred.  All right.  You know, argue about the economy.  Why?  Not some frickin' movies of holding ties and chick and a dude.  Go somewhere else with that, please.  Why is that?  Go somewhere else with that.  Don't talk about race and gender.  That's not...  Why can't Nick talk about this stuff, bro?  Because he's acting like it's some kind of huge global issue.  It's really not that big of a deal.  It's affecting this country.  Negatively. 
[02:38:00]  Negatively.  It affects our jobs.  It divides.  That's all.  Our jobs.  It's identity, you know.  Everything's seen to race and gender.  At least let's be honest about it.  And it's a double standard.  That's all.  There's separatism going on.  And let's be honest about it.  Don't you think it's dishonest, sir?  It's one-sided.  I just think you guys are looking at it in a much bigger way.  Hypocritical.  Oh, you don't think the mass media is...  There's 80 televisions in here running shit 24 hours a day.  You don't think TV and the media affects people's thoughts and ideas?  And that if things are portrayed inaccurately, that they will start believing this shit? 
[02:38:30]  It does, but...  And you don't think that that affects society?  I think to some extent, but the whole law and order and that bullshit?  Yeah.  I don't...  That's what these people eat up.  That's what middle America eats up.  They look at it and go, oh, look at that.  And don't you think that's...  And they eat it up.  Don't you think that's embarrassingly phony?  Yeah.  I mean, how do you watch it?  It's such a...  I can't even get past it.  It's such a...  It's a joke.  Sometimes I've got to break out my anus and anus box set. 
[02:39:00]  Once you're made aware of it, it's hard to watch it.  Yeah, yeah.  It is.  It just looks so phony, you know?  You're good to...  So everything would be completely fine, completely saved if it was a black guy committing a crime  on TV.  The world would be completely fine and everything would be fine.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It would just be...  You know something?  It would be nice for me to be on my couch and be able to go, wow, there's somebody with  a little more diversity in their portrayal of criminals instead of just having the alarm 
[02:39:30]  company time and time again having the white guy kick the door in.  Yeah, what's the matter, Tim?  Do you need this stuff kind of like spoon-fed to you?  Do you need to believe the world's a little different than it is so when TV tells you that  you feel a little bit better about yourself?  No, I can think for myself.  It's not that big of a deal.  Do you know, I think a lot of...  A lot of people can't talk.  I think a lot of home invasions with the kick in the door and entry, I don't think  a lot of them are white guys.  Just me.  I would like to look at the statistics, but I think a bunch of these kick the door in 
[02:40:00]  home invasions are probably not the people you see on the alarm commercial.  What if he was just a talented man and knew how to kick a door very well in the audition  Now you're being silly.  Now you don't even believe what you're saying, dude.  What you're saying is such bullshit.  You don't even believe it at all.  It's like, if you were in a job, like, what kind of job do you do?  I don't want to go into that.  Well, come on, Tim.  You wouldn't go into it the last few times you called.  Tim, you wouldn't go into it the last few times you called.  Why wouldn't you just go into it now?  I don't know.  I'm fine.  I'm in marketing. 
[02:40:30]  I'm fine.  He's in marketing.  He's the guy who used to do radio.  All right, Doug.  We're going to let you go.  We know, Doug.  All right, Doug.  But he's just a passive-aggressive little girl, and he likes the world the way it is.  Now, the people that come up with the commercial for the alarm company, they just don't  want to deal with, like, the Reverend Al Sharptons of the world, do you think?  Yeah, they don't want to.  Exactly right.  It makes it a lot easier.  Like, you know what?  Of course.  We don't need the hassle.  So if we do have a black guy kicking in a door.  And I'm saying, in that situation, put a ski mask on the guy and make it race neutral  or whatever.  At least do it that way.  And gloves.  Yeah.  And a full body suit. 
[02:41:00]  But you're saying they make sure they go completely the opposite way.  A little balance, that's all.  I mean, Jesus.  Because we don't organize and yell and scream about stuff, Whitey.  We don't have a white Reverend.  But the fact that this guy...  No, when we tried, we were called Nazis and when...  Rednecks.  Yeah, rednecks.  When white people, middle-class working white people went out to protest the taxes, they  were called Nazis and racist and...  We need a white Reverend Al to stand up for our interests.  Yeah.  We have one. 
[02:41:30]  It's called Jesus.  Oh!  We have Jesus.  But the fact that this guy is a pickup...  Jesus wasn't white.  But the fact that he doesn't...  That he thinks it's so innocuous.  Some of the pictures.  Well, he's the same...  He's called in a few times.  And what he is, he's like one of these cowards that won't say who he is or what he does.  It's like...  Yeah, yeah.  Because he was in radio once.  I guess he wasn't very good at it.  Yeah, he flopped.  And he failed out or whatever.  He's just one of those guys.  He flopped miserably.  And it doesn't have to mean, oh, you must hate my nar.  I'm just making a point here.  He knows that, dude.  He's just trying to be inflammatory. 
[02:42:00]  Because he needs...  He probably wants to have a radio job where he gets into it and debates.  But obviously, he's got nothing.  Can't do it.  So he just languishes in his anonymity.  We should try to move on.  Joe in New York just acknowledged Crash and The Shields are doing what you want them to do, Jimmy.  I have not seen either one of those shows.  No.  The movie Crash.  I love...  I love...  I know you love Crash.  That's why I bring it up.  I got Brendan Fraser to sign my copy this week.  I guarantee you, I can point out nine things in a movie that fucking...  In Crash?  Like what?  I would love to... 
[02:42:30]  I don't know.  I got to watch it again.  It was completely...  They do a better job.  I know they do a better job.  Let me tell you, it was completely politically incorrect.  In the sense that they show the fucking...  The flip side of both.  Like, they make everyone kind of a hero and a villain.  Right.  Which I loved.  The way they...  You think, oh, another white cop's a bad guy.  Yeah, no.  I understand.  Fucking Matt Dillon.  And then they show him dealing with that civil service worker, that fat bitch, and you're  like, don't wonder.  So why can't we have more of that?  And then they show him fucking saving that woman.  It's like, they really do give redemption to everybody.  I love that movie. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, and it stuck out like a sore thumb.  Why?  Because it was the exception to the fucking rule of the garbage that they put out.  Yes.  That's all.  I agree.  Phones are lit, but we got to move on.  We got audio of the guy that shot up the gym.  We got Sandy Kane standing by.  Why couldn't she be in that gym?  How perfect would that have been?  Sandy Kane's got to meet Nick DiPaolo.  Bullet wouldn't penetrate her elephant wrinkled skin.  We're going to do a quick break.  Nick DiPaolo, Comedy Shop, 16 Route, 46 West, Pine Brook, New Jersey, August 7th and August  8th.  And then a benefit for the Pauling, P-A-W-L-I-N-G, Fire Department on August 20th. 
[02:43:30]  Go to nickdip.com for info and tickets.  All right?  It's a skyline.  Right.  Sandy Kane next, and audio of the gym shooter, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Nick DiPaolo.  A few people bitching about the commercials.  All I can tell you is when we do an hour, hour and a half, we have to catch up sometimes.  So I don't know what to tell you.  We don't have a choice. 
[02:44:00]  We would love to just keep rolling.  I always thought satellite was commercial free, though.  Well.  Just the music.  Just the music.  Oh, is that right?  Nick, you ought to get this fucking satellite app.  This app is amazing.  Dude, I cannot stop yapping about this.  For the iPhone?  Dude, it's fucking amazing.  What?  What are you doing on it?  The child molester locator?  The new one?  Yeah, it's nice of a miss.  That's called a mirror.  No, look at this.  This fucking satellite.  What is that you're holding?  Holy crap.  I'll tell you how old it's fun.  When I call information, I get Sarah in Mount Pilot. 
[02:44:30]  Is that really your phone?  That's not his phone.  He's bullshitting.  Yeah, it is.  That's like the old...  It's sort of like the pebble for the people.  I need all that shit.  Nick.  For what?  At home.  Nick, what are you doing?  You gotta get online.  I'm on the computer.  I want to go up and look at this.  Nick.  Say black cock.  Boom.  I googled it.  I was late to the party, and I've had this phone for a year or two now.  Yeah?  The BlackBerry.  And are you doing that much better than me?  All right, bad point.  What do you have?  What kind of phone?  You don't like email on the phone?  I don't want to be that accessible to anybody. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, sweet.  How about I fucking hate it?  Even when this thing's ringing, I don't pick it up.  How the hell do you Twitter?  I don't.  I just text.  My website guy keeps telling me to, and I Twitter.  Yeah, I just say to Klondike Bar and fuck your mother.  Yeah, but you have funny stuff to say, dude.  Your tweets would be, or tweets, whatever you want to say to me.  I'd follow you.  Okay, let's say I put some funny tweets out there, and then how does that help me?  You're building your, you're building your.  You could talk to 30,000 fans at a time or 20,000 fans at a time.  Or 11, but go ahead.  But, or you could do whatever, if you're plugging something. 
[02:45:30]  Like I got this say now line.  This say now line.  If I give you, people just.  Why can't you do that when you get home on your computer?  Why are you going to do it for like a lunchtime?  You can, Nick.  Good point.  We all should go backwards.  No, I don't want to go backwards.  By the way.  What happened?  I did download the app.  Oh, shit.  The sexual offender app.  Yeah.  Oh, you're not kidding?  That's a real fucking.  Oh, dude.  It's one of the most popular apps that are being downloaded right now.  It's, uh, it's offender locator and you, uh, I use current location and now it's downloading, 
[02:46:00]  uh, the offenders and it's got a nasty little phase on.  Apparently there is an offender.  Let's see.  The closest one here is 0.4 mile, about a half mile away.  Um, we got this gentleman.  Let's see what he's done.  You sure?  It didn't say four feet.  And, uh, no.  Wait, do you mean, wait a minute.  Nope.  It could go either way now.  You got a picture.  Oh, that guy's great.  Looks like Uncle Paul.  What a creep.  Let me see.  Let me see the creep.  It does look like Uncle Paul would look.  And this guy, uh, lives, uh, right there on 49th Street. 
[02:46:30]  Uh, yeah.  And, uh, he's a naughty, naughty boy.  Why don't we pay him a visit?  And this is anywhere you are in the country.  You could hit the locator.  Oh, look.  Yeah, geez.  Uh, actual sexual intercourse.  Uh, I guess it's his, um.  What is that?  His crime with a minor.  Uh, he lives there on, uh, West 40th Street.  Yeah, but he's not.  Looks like a nice guy.  He might not be home right now.  I want to know where he's, where he is right at this.  This is how he lives. 
[02:47:00]  Maybe he'll Twitter you.  Yeah.  Tweet.  Wow.  Look at all those sex offenders.  I think you've all lost your minds personally.  Look at this.  Look at all the sex offender dots on that.  Oh, part of me.  What?  That's just in our area.  Oh, look at this guy.  That's a cookout at Jimmy's house.  This guy looks like Butchie from the Chicks show.  What the f?  Those are all sex offenders?  Yes, they are.  Jesus.  What's the name?  What's the name of this, by the way?  Are you fucking kidding me?  None of them in Secaucus?  What's going on in Secaucus where they don't have any over there?  Apparently there's no kids over there.  Yeah. 
[02:47:30]  You have to be 30 to move in.  That's incredible.  Good one.  Yeah, the app is called Offender Locator.  It's an epidemic there, Nick.  Yeah, apparently in Chelsea.  Yeah, look at that.  Can I make a correlation there without being called a...  Hey, wait a minute.  You know something?  Look at that.  Right there in Chelsea...  Thank you.  ...is a concentration of sexual offenders.  Thank you.  But there's no correlation between sucking a prick and fucking a cub scout.  The Offender app is currently the sixth highest downloaded free app.  Oh, yeah.  It's huge.  That's pretty cool.  People have just been downloading the hell out of that.  Who's against it? 
[02:48:00]  That is so cool.  Sex Offender Surge or Offender Locator Light?  Offender Locator.  Light?  Light.  Now, what's the different colors here?  Oh, I got heavy.  Which one?  Yeah, whichever one it is.  Like the red ones are the most dangerous?  Oh, there you go.  This is incredible.  Wait, what does red and green mean?  Offender at home, offender at work.  Green means they weren't that ugly.  Against children.  Red is children.  Red is children.  Yellow is rape.  Well, they didn't miss me.  It should be...  Hey, look at that.  There's a sexual battery.  Green is other offense, probably against like... 
[02:48:30]  Go uptown.  Can you go uptown a little more?  Go above the park.  I just want to see...  It's funny how it looks like a storm of sex offenders moving up the coast.  Yeah, yeah.  We have a lot of sex offenders coming in.  So, you know, you want to take your umbrellas down and hide your kids?  I'm predicting more yellow.  Yeah.  Ah, yeah, look at that.  It looks like a satellite map.  A little more yellow over there.  We have a low over Chelsea.  We have rape with a chance of sodomy.  That's right. 
[02:49:00]  Hey, Uncle Sully writes, my wife downloaded that app and it turned out the guy that lived  right next door was on the list.  Yeah.  There you go.  That's what you find out when you download that.  Aw, look at that.  Speaking of offensive, let's get Sandy Cain in here.  It actually feels good at this point.  Let's roll Sandy Cain in here.  I thought you didn't even notice.  I'm sorry.  I was bored.  You're a listener.  Jesus.  Oh, no.  One of the listeners said Nick DiPaolo, boring.  And the funny thing is, the phones, we couldn't get to them fast enough. 
[02:49:30]  Yes.  And that's, oh, here it is.  Nick Dipp sucks, boring.  John Winters in Syracuse.  Someone also said, all you ever talk about is race.  Me?  Or us?  No, no, us.  Like the show.  All we ever talk about is race.  It's called being relevant.  That's all we talk about.  Do more stripper shit.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what we'll do.  Race is a big thing in the country now.  We have a black president.  They're talking about Sotomayor's race.  Race and ethnicity are constantly being discussed. 
[02:50:00]  Bigger than ever, right?  It is.  It is.  Sorry to bring up something relevant.  It's bigger than U.S. Steel.  Asshole in Syracuse.  Jonathan Winters.  Here comes Sandy Cain.  Where is she?  Go to Sony Purchase.  Atta boy, Nick.  Where is that fucking, oh, I got to respect.  We got to be respectful of it.  Yeah, she was traumatized by her last appearance on the show.  It was the only place you get a real portrayal.  When we threw turkey gravy on it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Maury.  Maury?  Maury keeps it real.  Maury, uh...  Violent mud.  Eric, uh, getting her pregnant, and they take the pregnancy test. 
[02:50:30]  Are you the baby daddy?  Oh, my God.  Florida woman allegedly hires policemen to kill her husband.  Oops.  Picked the wrong person there, did ya?  What a terrible fucking marriage.  Oopsie.  What the fuck happened to Sandy Cain?  We have a nice pace to the show today.  Wow, she's sexy, too.  Wow, what the fuck, dude, huh?  What'd he do to her?  Isn't there something about a sexy female criminal that did something horrid?  Yeah.  And you're just like, I don't know. 
[02:51:00]  Makes you want to be a lawyer.  Fuck it, let her go.  Fuck her.  I fuck her.  Where is Sandy?  This is what the country's turned into.  Look, she's acting like she...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the, uh...  Yeah, when you see the, um...  And you get the exploiting douche that hosts the show.  I just...  Yeah.  It just...  It's infuriating.  Holy shit, what the fuck happened to...  We had such a good pace to the show.  Where is Sandy?  Hope's trying to keep the train going. 
[02:51:30]  Holy shit, what the fuck?  Where is she?  She was down in the office.  Where is she?  She was down in the office.  I heard she sprained...  She sprained her plastic hip.  Yes.  What does she do?  She's having her vagina fucking mosquito fumigated.  I was a little backed up, man.  You know how strippers have, like, fake tits?  She's actually got fake knees and hips.  She has fake tits.  She uses them as shoulder pads.  Rotten old lady.  Rotten old lady.  Look at that nice couple nodding on Maury. 
[02:52:00]  She's probably just...  She's just rubbing her chlamydia all over everything.  Oh, God.  I mean, what happened?  Where is this fucking...  Where is this horrific old woman?  There's going to be hell to pay.  She's ruining the show.  Danny!  Before she even gets here.  Oh, here she comes.  What are we doing?  Santa has to get his backstage audio.  Well, get the backstage audio after her.  Not when it's a live show.  What the fuck?  You kidding?  You interrupt that shit for the show.  Yes, of course.  Hi, Sandy.  Sandy Kane, everybody.  Sandy, there she is.  There's a little respect to you. 
[02:52:30]  I agree, baby.  All right.  Hey, George.  Hi, Sandy.  R-E-S-P-C-T.  This is Nick.  He actually...  Hi, Sandy.  He's been waiting to meet you.  Nick DiPaolo, baby.  How are you, baby?  You said you're a piece of ass at Stand Up New York.  Remember?  I did?  Yes.  Back in 1948?  Yes.  Yes, I do.  Here you go, man.  Yeah, you changed a little since then.  Hey, man.  Here you go, man.  Sandy's just a hippie girl.  She's just a grown-up hippie.  It was dark.  And you changed, too.  Thank you.  You have a clean-shaven, like, usually.  Yeah. 
[02:53:00]  All right.  That's great.  I heard you were coming today.  That's fine.  I ain't coming.  I heard you coming, too.  You look like Wavy Gravy with a cunt.  What's Wavy Gravy saying?  Do you guys have to talk like that to her?  That was out of line, Anthony.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  She doesn't want to hear the word gravy.  I want to apologize to Wavy Gravy.  I don't get the joke.  I don't get the Wavy Gravy joke.  You don't know Wavy Gravy from Woodstock, man?  No, I don't.  Remember?  He was the guy that was, you know, going around telling people not to take the brown acid.  Turn sideways and show everyone how you're wearing your headphones. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, I understand.  Let's see.  No, turn toward ants the other way.  That's fine.  Hey, was it...  Listen...  No, I don't remember that from Woodstock.  By the way, I like this song a lot.  Was J.J. French playing as well as you thought he would when you guys recorded that new song?  Which one?  He taught me how to love and now I'm fucking...  No, 30.  Yeah, 30.  30.  30 what?  Yeah.  The new song you did, Dee Snider.  Her tits are 20.  Her hands are 110.  I love Dee Snider, man.  I love Dee Snider.  Sandy Kane.  And I was just thinking about Dee Snider.  In fact...  I forgot. 
[02:54:00]  He was, you know, he was very, very good to me.  Dee Snider.  Sandy Kane.  Is that glitter or a skin disease?  What are you wearing?  A little boat.  Oh, is it?  What is that?  You've got glitter all over you.  I know.  Let me just take my top down.  Go ahead, man.  Usually when we hear that, we can't wait.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, like Sandy's going to shut the curtains.  Why?  I make a lot of fucking money in Times Square with these titties.  Unfortunately, those are real.  Yeah, that's just it.  That's what I was telling them.  I tried to get a job with flash dancers and they said, no, you have real tits. 
[02:54:30]  We only want implants.  You could get a job there if you find a DeLorean that Doc Brown made.  New head they want.  New head.  Sandy, let's start with your last appearance.  Flash duncers.  You were traumatized by your experience on the Opie and Anthony show?  Why?  What happened?  What happened?  Let's get into it so we can get over it.  Okay.  All right.  What happened in your eyes?  In my thighs.  No, I mean that you cut my...  She's funny.  You cut my fucking guitar strings.  Yeah, that wasn't...  And that's my baby here.  Look. 
[02:55:00]  I mean, this is my man.  This is my baby.  This is my whole life here.  I'm trying to reinvent my fucking self instead of being a fucking stripper working in peep shows.  What do you want to come back as?  Watching guys urinate your cup for money.  And then, you know, I just wanted to know.  I mean, and then you cut them, man.  It's just like, it's my baby.  You should reinvent yourself.  The prototype stinks.  That was really bad.  That was really bad.  They break the green mold.  Sandy, play a song for us.  Let's hear a song.  Okay.  All right. 
[02:55:30]  And then we want to ask you a little about your part as the naked cowgirl there in Times Square.  And what about the gravy, too?  It wasn't just the guitar strings, you know, because that was really bad that that happened.  But what about the gravy?  Turkey gravy.  Turkey gravy.  And then we threw you or something?  No, no.  It was yogurt.  Don't you remember?  Oh, the yogurt?  I told you.  It was yogurt, man.  It was pretty much everything we could find.  It was a violin.  It was violin.  It was violent.  It was violent.  It was violent.  It was violent.  It was.  It was fucking violent.  And I wouldn't expect that from a white guy. 
[02:56:00]  All right?  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  No.  Black men, white men.  Wait, who raped you again?  Nick DiPaolo needs to know, like, the history.  Oh, I thought you were accusing Nick.  Richard Pryor and Phil Spector.  And Phil Spector.  Now.  Together or a different time?  I'm serious.  Now.  It's true.  They were together.  I read them both.  They did improv.  So, yeah.  Is that right?  We don't know if that's true, Nick.  Obviously, we want to go on the record and say we don't know for sure, but that's what  she said.  No, that's the comedy story.  One's dead and one's in fucking prison. 
[02:56:30]  Good point.  What are they going to do?  I think Phil Spector's got more to worry about.  Weren't you called in on the Phil Spector murder case?  Yes, I was.  They wanted to prove that I ran out of...  That it could have been another criminal because someone else has a Phil Spector wig  and it was you.  It was you.  Sorry.  No, they did.  She was playing the part of the corpse.  I'll tell you.  The L.A. police were the biggest liars.  They were the biggest liars, man.  Really, man?  They were fucking liars.  Why is that? 
[02:57:00]  Can we like your hair on fire today?  Why are they liars, man?  I met the L.A. police.  They were like the fucking biggest liars I ever...  Why?  Let me...  Yeah, tell that to Linda Kasabian.  Oh, shit.  Who's that?  That's one of Manson's victims.  I mean, Manson's followers.  Well, how about that Folger lady?  Yeah, that's what I met.  Right.  How about Abigail Folger?  Yeah.  Pryor had a funny joke about how Manson will always stay in jail as long as motherfuckers 
[02:57:30]  still drink coffee.  He'll be in jail.  Tell that to Rosemary LaBianca.  That's right.  Or Sharon Tate.  Or Sharon Tate.  Or Robin Polanski.  Or Mr. Tate, for that matter.  Larry Tate.  Keith Sebring.  Jay Sebring.  Jay Sebring in the house.  Boston Bewitched.  Jay Sebring.  The Tate.  The Tate.  No, that was really terrible.  Fucking Stephen's murder.  Sharon Tate.  Sharon Tate.  Sandy.  Fucking Sharon Tate in the fucking house. 
[02:58:00]  Sandy.  Did you find God or something?  Yeah, what happened?  Jesus talked to you or something?  Yeah, what's up with you and Jesus?  How do you know that?  We find things out.  I'm a seer, my friend.  I'm a seer.  A lot of people that see you in Times Square talk to you, and then they talk to us.  Yeah.  It's a small little town.  You know, you think Manhattan's big.  They look after you, Sandy Kane.  It's a little village, isn't it?  She thought he mentioned her in the Bible when he said he healed a leper.  He's like, hey, man.  Hey, man.  I'm fucking a pastor.  So he instilled me with God.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  And he has a great dick. 
[02:58:30]  So, you know, it really inspired me.  Sandy's fucking inspired me, man.  He's got a great dick.  A godly man.  I think she's mad.  A godly penis.  Yeah?  Yeah.  How do you hook up with a pastor?  It's a long story.  Just tell it in a short version.  Very long.  You thought it was a peep booth?  If I saw her, I'd have passed that.  That's funny.  He's doing penance.  Apparently, he's drunk drove and killed a family.  He's a blind man.  And he's like, Lord, if I fuck this monster, can I get into heaven?  He is a blind pastor. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, is he?  Yes.  Must be like the scene from Madden.  Legally blinds me.  Legally blinds me.  Sandy, can you at least...  I know you're trying to move on.  You've got a new career.  You're doing the Jesus thing.  But Nick has never seen Twato.  And I know it's old hat at this point.  Old hat.  But could you give him a quick peek at Twato?  And then we'll move on to the new stuff.  We'll move on.  What is the fucking shit, man?  I'm all right.  It's actually kind of slick.  Nick, you've got to see Twato.  No, I don't know if I really want to do this.  Really quick.  Closy.  All right, just show Nick real fast. 
[02:59:30]  I did it.  I did it.  No, no, Sandy, come on.  I didn't see it.  No, I'm sorry.  Okay, all right, thank you.  Let me see him.  No, Nick, come on.  He's a gentleman.  Will you play along?  What's wrong with you?  Come on, let's see it.  What's wrong, Nick?  I don't like it, baby.  This is something you've never seen before.  I just say it a huge omelet, man.  All right, well, cool.  We've got a mushroom for you.  Just show Nick.  Show Nick.  I just saw it.  This is amazing.  I think Sandy's going to be in on the smoke and the weed session.  Put that somewhere, will you?  Before I put it back in a case.  Stick that in his ass, right?  Stick that fucking thing in his ass.  Put it in his ass.  Okay, hold on.  Seth Rogen, Sandy Kane. 
[03:00:00]  It's just, hey, okay, it really, it's on my vagina.  Go slow.  I really don't know, folks, how this happened.  Like my inverted nipples.  I remember you shaved, you cut yourself, and then it turned into that.  Yeah, that's.  I remember the story.  Thank you.  Nick, we had a name story.  We had to name it.  Here we go.  And we named it Twato.  Twato.  Come on.  I mean, people come up to me.  Can I see Twato?  Can I see Twato?  Show it.  Show it.  Yeah, just show it, and we'll get it over with, and then we'll be able to talk about  Twato in the house, folks.  I'm fucking nervous.  Move your head.  Here it is. 
[03:00:30]  The omelet.  Nick just dropped his 20-year-old phone.  The omelet.  The omelet.  Nick dropped his fucking dial.  His dial didn't drop.  His dial.  What the fuck?  What's he got on the bar of soap in his hands?  Her vagina has.  All right, let's go to Nick.  Nick, yes.  What?  Her vagina has mesothelioma.  What's that?  What's that?  Something you get from asbestos.  Yes.  All the lawyers are talking about.  What was that?  It's a fucking hat.  Her fucking pussy's an Irish gangster.  No, I really think that I was meant to have that, so when I'm on radio, I can just, 
[03:01:00]  that was meant to be.  What the fuck is that?  It helps with reception.  It's a fucking satellite dish.  The fuck?  It's pretty much an ear that's hanging off the side of the area.  Yeah, you got Boom Boom Mancini's.  It's a fucking.  It's a fucking woman that had that, man.  I wouldn't.  Are you shitting me?  If you've been punched in the twat as many times as her, she's got collard plumber.  Fate will attack their pussy.  Why do you get a truffle growing out of your hole?  It's like a woods in fucking Italy. 
[03:01:30]  It was like, you ever pick up a dead tree in the woods and turn it over and it's got like  a mushroom on it?  Mushrooms on there.  That's what it looks like.  Holy shit.  A little mushroom.  Would you suck on it?  Would I suck on it?  No.  Who sucked on it?  Polo with a little hot sauce.  Polo sucked on it.  A little hot sauce on it.  Polo did suck on it.  So Italian, you know?  Italian men.  Now, when did that show up?  I don't know about them.  That showed up a long time ago.  I can't believe I touched your guitar.  No, but we had a doctor on.  Remember?  She said, it's nothing.  Remember that doctor?  It's nothing unless you're a guy.  She was pointing at you as a whole when she said that. 
[03:02:00]  No, she said, it's a nothing thing, man.  She was a good doctor.  Remember they had a whole stream of doctors looking at you?  You don't need a doctor.  You need a tree surgeon.  Oh, that's funny.  Oh, my God.  Tree surgeon.  That is something.  See, we got over it now.  I got a craving for shiitakes.  What's that?  It's a mushroom.  I like mushrooms.  You got to know.  It's a mushroom.  It's traumatized, man. 
[03:02:30]  Now, then your dick isn't perfect.  Oh.  No, it's not perfect, but it doesn't have fiberglass growing on the side of it.  Holy shit.  Come on.  If you ever expose yourself, there'd be something.  Phil Spector give you that?  Yeah.  It's like someone threw, like, chewed up hubba bubba at you, and you never turned it away.  It looks like a piece of modern furniture.  Like a curved seat.  I just want to sit on her genital wart and fucking catch up on my reading.  It's not a genital wart.  Of course it is. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, no.  Of course it is.  She swears it's not.  It's more than a wart.  No, the doctor said it wasn't.  It's a fucking genital canopy.  It's not even a wart.  I want to lay under that and fucking shade myself.  And it's in a heart shape, by the way.  Remember that for Valentine's Day?  I did it up in red.  It's a human heart.  Yeah, not a heart shape.  She paints it.  It's a heart shape.  Oh, you paint it?  Do you use exterior or interior?  Are you going to prime that thing first?  How about having it removed?  Yeah.  You're like that singer.  What's the guy that's hanging on his face?  What would I do on the show if I had it removed? 
[03:03:30]  You should have it removed.  I mean, that's her thing.  So that's your key to get into show business?  Right.  So grab some piano wire and give it the old Luca Brasi.  It probably would start going...  Fucking conjoined twin twat.  Jesus Christ.  How's that taking off?  Why?  She's not going to take it off.  If it ain't broken, don't fix it.  It is broken.  Not only is it broken, it's infected and rotting away. 
[03:04:00]  I think it should affect others.  Come on.  Jesus Christ.  70 pounds of napalm wouldn't dent that fucking thing.  That's like saying, if it ain't broken, don't fix it after the shuttle explodes.  Yeah.  When the debris is coming down in flames.  Can we throw darts at it?  Oh.  You know, I just feel...  No, don't worry about it.  Now, how did God end your life?  And what message did God give you?  That's a man.  She's a man.  You're looking the wrong way. 
[03:04:30]  No, I'm not.  He's talking about Wendy Williams there.  Yeah, I know.  Our favorite.  What did God say?  What did God say?  God said, you know, I had the idea to go out as a naked cowgirl.  Sorry about the genealogy.  The naked cowboy inspired me.  I said, well, I play guitar.  They had this other naked cowgirl, flat-chested with pasties.  She was pretty hot.  And she was his wife.  Wasn't that his wife?  No way.  That's what I heard.  No way.  Isn't he going to sue you?  Who?  You should be the naked cow cadaver.  First of all, I got the idea from her, not from him. 
[03:05:00]  Second of all, I worked on every fucking strip club on Broadway and 7th Avenue.  I worked at the Metropole.  The naked cow patty.  I worked every fucking strip club.  I was naked before him.  And, you know, it's a free New York.  That's one thing great about fucking Times Square.  No one can sue anyone.  I say bring back martial law.  You know, naked cowgirl.  You know.  Right, right.  You should perform at Tiananmen Square.  I've been naked for all my life, man.  You know. 
[03:05:30]  Why are you stuck in 1968?  Yeah, really.  Well, because I haven't fucked you yet, Nick.  Oh.  Damn.  You're a fooling dick.  Wow.  Now that I've seen your vagina, I thought your odds are going up.  So if I had my twat hole taken off, would you fuck me?  I wouldn't.  You've got to put an easy pass in your pubes so that gate goes up.  Fucking twat gate.  Do you eat out?  Do I eat out?  You a lesbian?  Yes, actually.  Okay.  Yes, I am a lesbian.  Okay.  Abe Magoda is fucking with Nick. 
[03:06:00]  I'd rather, I'd eat Abe Magoda's ass before I touch that pussy.  Oh, my God.  After he took a nice fucking bran muffin dump.  Fucking.  Sandy.  Thank you.  I needed that.  So let's focus.  God told you.  Let's focus.  God told you.  Yeah, okay.  What?  Okay.  And I said to him, Lord, how am I fucking going to do this?  How am I going to go out to Times Square, man?  There's no roof.  There's no barmaids.  There's no roof.  There's no barmaids. 
[03:06:30]  There's no people.  Blumberg's working on that.  Yeah, yeah.  Hello.  Move for this guy.  I always say, so God said to me, be bold and mighty forces will come to your aid.  And then I said, but Lord.  Be bold and you'll die of aids.  He said.  You misunderstood.  Be bold and mighty forces will come to your aid.  And I said, but Lord, how am I going to do it?  And he says, Sandy, I'll be closer to you than ever.  That means you're going to die soon.  Yeah, really?  That doesn't sound very promising. 
[03:07:00]  So here he is.  She pointed up to this guy.  And you heard an actual voice?  Yeah.  When was this?  At your house?  I always do, man.  I look at a vagina and three words come to mind.  What do you mean you always do?  Cut me, Mick.  I always do hear God speaking.  I always do.  Yeah.  I always do.  Hey, man, it's a tough life.  You did a lot of acid, didn't you, Sandy?  If God talked to you.  Definitely.  Definitely.  If God talked to you.  I did everything.  How did you end up in the position you, you know, ended up in?  What did he say to you?  He's doing pretty good.  Hey, I'm on the fucking Opie and Anthony fucking show. 
[03:07:30]  No, no, no.  I mean, it's cool and everything.  Let me tell you.  You guys are fucking hot.  Because I was talking about you the other day.  Some guys are, oh, they're huge.  To God?  No.  No, this is a human being.  Give us a good word.  No, so I mean.  Tell God we're funny.  Okay.  Lord, they're fucking funny.  I could do that.  One day we're just talking to you.  Yeah, but you don't know, man.  To the Lord.  Oh, he loves you.  Lead us in a prayer.  How does he love it?  Lead us in a prayer.  Lead us in a prayer.  You know, he's very open-minded.  Is he George Burns or Morgan Freeman, Lord God?  Which one?  God is more, God is God, you know, Jesus, God, whatever. 
[03:08:00]  Well, no, they're two separate people.  Morgan Freeman.  Well, Morgan Freeman was God in one movie.  And then George Burns was God in another one.  So what is he more like?  What is he more like prior in Holy Moses?  Yeah, maybe he's like that.  Does he look like, does Jesus look like the painting?  With the hair and the...  Did he have a penis, Jesus?  I would assume, yeah.  I guess, yeah.  He was a man.  Enough about the penis.  Okay, he was a man.  But, you know, I'm just saying, did he masturbate? 
[03:08:30]  Did Jesus masturbate?  No, I don't.  I mean, we have to.  No, I'll tell you.  No, let me get serious.  I think you're trying to be shocking, Sandy.  No, okay.  And it's not working.  And I go to church every Sunday.  I don't need this one.  You know, you're being very offensive to Catholics out there and people that praise Jesus.  Yeah, well, listen, I'm a Jew.  I can do it.  Well, see?  Jesus was a Jew.  No, he wasn't.  No, he wasn't.  Jesus was a Jew.  He was a man.  He was an Italian.  He was not. 
[03:09:00]  Well, he was Italian.  He was.  He was Ethiopian.  No, Jesus was a Jew, man.  You know, I need to...  He was an Ethiopian.  And I'm the chosen, man.  All right.  You're the chosen.  Chosen to suffer, man.  You're chosen to donate your clit to science.  So now you're the cowgirl or whatever, right?  Yeah, now you're the naked cowgirl.  Now, what happened to the other naked cowgirl?  She's making porno movies.  And some guy came over to me and said, hey, man, I gave her all my money, man.  When the money ran out.  So Frankie Five Angels came over to her? 
[03:09:30]  She went to L.A.  Champagne!  She was a claw girl.  She was a claw girl.  Cheat-chabot.  She was a claw girl.  Who was?  She was a fucking hooker.  Who was?  The other naked cowgirl.  No, she wasn't.  How do you know?  No.  Because she's dating the guy who...  She's dating the naked cowboy, that chick.  Isn't she?  A little bit.  The naked cowboy lives in Jersey with an older woman who has three grown daughters.  That's where the naked cowboy...  I don't think she's a hooker.  All right, something smells...  We don't know.  God damn it.  She is. 
[03:10:00]  It's just her twat.  It's not me.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I got caught between her twat and his shit.  I didn't fart.  I swear to God.  Nick, what happened?  It's like a surf and turf.  It's like a surf and turf.  We lost Nick.  I did not fart.  Sandy Ken, you want to play a song?  What are we doing here?  Okay, but anyway, I did find God, and I found the naked cowboy, who's also a reverend,  you know?  Do you know that the...  Does your twat smell?  Does your twat smell?  I do.  See, this is the other name. 
[03:10:30]  Smell your pussy.  Smell my pussy.  Would you like to?  Oh, no, but I know someone who would.  Oh, E-Rock!  E-Rock!  Oh, E-Rock!  It's time to do your sniffing duties.  Because we can't have our guest, Nick DiPaolo, bothered by a weird smell in the studio, so  we've got to find out where that weird smell is coming from.  That was not me, baby.  So, E-Rock will be...  No, it wasn't you.  Oh, can I sit on your face and make sure?  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  You sexy a year old...  Wow.  I'd rather have the thing from Alien on my face. 
[03:11:00]  Nick DiPaolo in the fucking house.  It's less contagious.  Let me tell you, E-Rock, you are hysterical.  Both of you.  I saw them both in Stand Up New York.  I've got to say, Jim Norton is hysterical, and this fucking guy with your ass in Stand Up  New York.  Remember, you kept bending over.  I did?  Yes, in Stand Up New York.  I was bending over for what?  Yeah, I don't know.  For pay for the night?  Yeah, that's how I get paid.  Yeah, I'm just saying, in Stand Up New York, these guys are hysterical.  Shows a punch like he takes it in the ass.  I'm definitely...  At least these guys are two funny fucking comics. 
[03:11:30]  I've got to say.  I'm honored to be with you guys.  I'm honored to be with you.  Listen, Toilet Crush wants somebody to open mouth kiss Sandy Kane.  I've never met a woman with a ziti growing on her clip.  Is there anyone willing to open mouth kiss Sandy Kane?  Am I willing to open mouth kiss Sandy Kane?  Well, we can bring in the interns, but hold on, E-Rock.  No.  One step at a time.  I'm not a kisser.  I'm not a kisser.  I'd rather suck a dick than kiss a man.  Wow, we have something in common.  Wow.  All right, E-Rock.  And we've got to get to...  Why is that thought process in that body... 
[03:12:00]  No, that is really true.  I don't like kissing.  Sandy, how old are you?  Can you keep a secret?  Yeah.  Well, that's mine.  Oh, she got you, Mr. D'Arm.  Oh, did she get you?  Can we have E-Rock smell her conner?  Let's go.  Hey, I've done this twice already.  That worked great when she used that line on Fatty Arbuckle.  Yeah, exactly.  He broke a bottle in her box and she just walked away.  This show should be on NPR.  Yes, of course.  We have E-Rock smell.  E-Rock refuses to smell her.  I've done this twice. 
[03:12:30]  E-Rock, come on.  It might be time for somebody else to get a fresh smell.  You've done it twice.  Come on, E-Rock.  Three times is a charm.  That's true.  Hey, who's...  I'm not a lie.  Can you spread your legs?  We just want to make sure you push it out.  I can't believe you guys traumatized.  I'm visually fucking sick of myself.  Hey, Opie, you...  Then we do a song.  You smell it, man.  How fucking no.  Why not, Opie?  Opie, you can just smell it.  How fucking no.  What?  What do you mean, not you?  Don't touch it.  Why not?  Why not?  If Ant does it, I'll do it.  I wouldn't touch that.  I wouldn't fucking...  There you go.  Sandy, did you get that hat from the naked cowgirl? 
[03:13:00]  There's a bad fucking smell.  Where'd you get that hat?  I bought it.  Because it looks exactly like the one from the other naked cowgirl.  I know, baby.  Wait, can I see that?  Oh, really?  You look much different than her.  Show Ant the hat.  No, I don't want to see the hat.  Listen, this girl has no fucking tits.  I'm looking at her.  She's got tits.  Throw him the hat.  Let's see.  No, don't fucking throw me the hat.  Don't throw me the hat.  Don't throw me the hat.  I would like to see her, man.  Well, Danny can pop her up on that computer.  Yeah, do me a favor.  I'd like to see her.  She's making porno movies in L.A.  She's no longer around.  Ant, you want to see the hat? 
[03:13:30]  She's all right.  She's got, like, cushy.  I like her little perky tits.  She's a gorgeous woman.  This guy told me that she's making porno movies in L.A.  for $10,000 a pop.  Well, why don't you get that deal?  Because I really, you know, I...  Without the thousand parts.  I went to make pointer movies years ago.  Hopefully the pop is a 38 at the end of the movie.  Make it, she is.  Make it, girl.  Okay.  E-Rock, they're yelling, do the bit.  Do the bit.  Do the bit.  Do the bit. 
[03:14:00]  I've done the bit.  Do the bit, man of steel.  Come on.  Sandy Kane, could you spread your legs so E-Rock could make sure you're...  E-Rock's just going to take a little tits here.  She has a little tits here.  Why am I not trying?  They're perky.  There it goes.  Sandy Kane is here.  Oh, I would love to be as a naked...  She hasn't been here in years, by the way.  Look, see, she's...  I remember her.  She's not so hot.  I thought she was better looking than you.  She's way hotter than you.  She's all right.  She's way hotter.  So is he.  To be honest, I think I look better.  Yeah, well...  I want to.  I have better tits.  I want to go see an eye doctor.  She's like...  I don't like the way she looks, man. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, her tits suck.  They sit up straight and perky.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's gross.  I like body dads in my waist.  I got double Ds.  No, she's cute, but...  You're disgusting and disastrous.  I said she was better looking than that, really.  Duty and distational.  I really believe...  Dummy.  Down syndrome.  Dropping and dirty.  I believe I'm better looking than this bitch.  You're crazy.  You're crazy to think that.  Okay, well...  I'm sure you did.  You were.  She's got nice, smooth, like, young, fucking supple... 
[03:15:00]  Her face is fat.  She has no tits.  No, I thought she was better looking than this.  You're describing Bob Kelly.  Come on.  He has tits.  That was stupid.  Why are you holding up your hat still?  I don't know.  Did he lose weight?  This is the same fucking hat.  Yeah, same hat.  Yeah, well, you could buy it at the cowboy store.  Did Daniel Boone give you that after you jerked him off?  Fucking Nick.  Nickdiff.com.  Are you guys going to Philly this weekend?  Yes.  I have to go with you, right? 
[03:15:30]  I'm kidding, Shady.  Yeah, we're all going.  UFC.  Yeah, how's that working?  We've got to find out about...  You're going now?  We've got to find out about...  What, no, my brother and stuff are going?  Whose fight?  You're not going?  Are you going yet?  I don't know.  You should go.  You'd love it.  You should go.  It's going to be a party.  Hey, Iraq, come on.  Smell her pussy, please.  Oh, please.  Come on, Iraq.  No, I want Opie to do it.  I ain't doing that.  Come on, Opie.  Oh, fuck it.  Come on, Opie.  Ratings, man.  If Nick does it, I'll do it.  Dude, I'm already...  I'm already psychologically scarred when I just saw that.  The omelet.  The omelet. 
[03:16:00]  That fucked me up.  Hey, man.  The omelet.  The omelet, she calls it.  How fucking disgusting is that?  No, I'm talking about he ain't an omelet.  He only threw up.  Oh, I thought she was talking about Twato.  It looks like an omelet.  No, okay, no.  It looked like the referee's here.  Let me tell you, folks, I'm better looking than this fucking bitch,  the other naked cowgirl.  Iraq, just get in there.  No wonder the naked cowgirl likes me better.  And I have a shtick.  She has absolutely no personality.  She's from the mid-fucking-west.  Doesn't have a truffle on her twat.  Yeah.  That's right.  Iraq.  She has a country girl next door look. 
[03:16:30]  Right, she does.  And I have, like...  You have a country.  A backdoor.  A backdoor look.  Get it, because I'm taught.  A Newark, New Jersey backdoor look.  Girl next door look if you live next door to the Munsters.  No, I'm telling you.  Thank you.  Are we going to do the pussy smell thing or not?  Oh, yeah, move on.  Sandy Kane, just spread your legs.  You know the deal.  Come on.  You're getting great promotion from our show.  Let's go.  Hey, let me tell you, man.  I can't pay my fucking rent with promotion.  Really?  That's how it usually works.  When the landlord comes, that means more people see you and give you money. 
[03:17:00]  For money, I go, oh, I'm on O&A.  Oh, fuck.  Forget the rent.  That's cool.  But we can tell people to go down, you know, Times Square and make sure they take care of you.  Yeah, all right.  Come to 46th Street and Broadway, man, and smell twat.  There you go.  Oh, you're promoted.  Sandy Kane, I got $1 that I will give you if E-Rock smells your pussy.  One fucking dollar, man.  If you have two quarters that you can return him.  Man, give me fucking at least $100.  Get the fuck out of here.  Your pussy ain't worth fucking $5. 
[03:17:30]  Why?  Why not?  E-Rock isn't doing the bit.  I can't believe this.  E-Rock, do the bit.  Do the bit.  Come on, Sandy Kane.  Hey, no, you don't do.  If you cooperate, maybe we give you a little more.  What?  Well, maybe.  Put it up and shut up.  Nope.  Come on.  Nope.  Come on.  Maybe you're multi-fucking million fucking ass, man.  And I'm like a poor bitch here.  Oh, by the way.  Sounds like a Manson follower, doesn't he?  Hold on.  David's got a very good point here.  Damon in New Jersey.  Go ahead.  They're all that old now.  Hey. 
[03:18:00]  So, you'll wipe human baby shit on your face, but you won't just get near her swat and smell it?  You got that right.  It's a good idea, doesn't it?  Yeah.  You got that right.  And then someone else pointed out that I ate the gum off the bottom of my shoe one day,  and I'd rather do that than smell her.  Come on, Opie.  I'll fucking know.  Yeah, go for it, man.  I've seen E-Rock do this, and E-Rock will puke.  Hey, Walt.  E-Rock, can we get this done?  Someone else try.  Did you shower?  I can't believe it. 
[03:18:30]  I'm in no mood to be smelt.  When did you shower?  Give me my dollar back.  Sandy, show your asshole.  When did you shower last?  Come on, I want respect.  When did you shower last?  I'm there on a magical day.  About two years ago.  Come on.  You want respect, or do you want a $20 bill?  What am I?  Tippi Tom?  If E-Rock could smell your asshole, we'll get $20.  We win.  Tippi Tom in the house.  Not anymore.  She brightened up.  I know.  Oh, boy, am I, let's see.  Bend over and let E-Rock smell your asshole for $20.  Smells like 1928. 
[03:19:00]  $20.  Wait, she's thinking it over.  $20.  What about $100?  And you got it.  How fucking hell?  There's a black line picture of her pussy hanging at the Ovalet Hotel.  I want to get a new Victoria's Secret for my pulpit.  Come on.  Opie, you got so much fucking money, man.  $20 fucking dollars for it.  Come on.  What about $100?  $100.  What about $100?  Really?  What about $50 and $50?  I'll give you $20.  You know how much money I spent on my pool?  You can suck a cock if any intern in here.  I don't want to suck a cock.  I can't.  I spend a lot of money on ammunition. 
[03:19:30]  I can't be buying the likes of your...  All right, pull your pants down.  It's $20 or nothing.  Okay.  You need the $20.  $20.  Okay, throw it over.  How fucking...  What do you think I was born yesterday?  A 1922 penny's going to fall out of her bug.  A little wheat back.  She's on the gold standard back then.  Indian head nickel.  This is what I'll do.  I'll give the $20 to Nick.  You can trust him.  Get the fuck out.  I'm not touching that.  No, no, no.  You don't have to touch...  And then the Nick will hand...  Or throw the money at you after he rocks your asshole. 
[03:20:00]  That's fair.  So is it pussy or asshole?  Make up your fucking mind.  That's the difference.  With you.  That was a really...  Mid-ground.  Who cares?  Sandy, come on.  You're killing the show.  You're killing the show.  We're going to run out of your back.  What about $40?  What is this?  Fucking Bangladesh?  She doesn't have a taint anymore.  $20 for the pussy and $20 for the asshole.  Come on, let's go.  Okay, come on.  She doesn't have a taint anymore.  It dissolved in 1971.  Yeah, I don't know.  I might take a pass.  What do you think, E-Roc? 
[03:20:30]  What do you think, E-Roc?  Shut up and do it.  Okay, you think...  Richard Pryor and Phil Specker's...  Here's the $20.  I'll give it to Nick.  Grab that so she doesn't, like...  What am I doing with it?  She'll just throw it at her after E-Roc smells.  All right.  Pull the pants down, E-Roc.  I can't do that.  Yeah, E-Roc's not a lot of touch.  He's a lot of fucking smell.  All right.  You've got to pull your pants down.  Oh, well, I'm not going to do it all the way.  Just pull them down, you fucking silly goose-a-balooza.  All right, here we go.  E-Roc, get in there.  Jesus Christ, I'm getting nervous.  Get a mic down here. 
[03:21:00]  I got it.  All right.  Here goes E-Roc.  Ew, it's all shiny and glittery.  It's all right.  Why did I time it right?  Pull them...  No, no.  Sandy, take them down.  No, not for $20, but $100.  Take them down.  You did a lot more for a lot less.  We're going to let you promote.  You know what?  She's fucking forgetting.  Come on.  She's pulling it back up.  Fuck this.  No promotion or nothing.  Send her away.  Yeah, let's get her out of here.  Send her away.  This is stupid.  Oh, Sandy.  I'm sorry.  Hey, you know something, guys?  Let me tell you something.  You get $20, and then you get to sing one of your songs.  What's fucking $20 fucking bucks, man? 
[03:21:30]  Forget it.  The promotion ain't worth it.  Don't come.  In this day and age?  Yeah, nothing.  A lot of people have no money this day and age.  No, but not me, baby.  I complained I had no shoes until I saw a man who had no shoes as well.  Who had no dick.  The war, no dick.  All I know is that, man.  It happened to me, man.  You know, I met a guy like that in Times Square.  He was blown up in Iraq.  He had no dick.  All I know is that made $20.  I said, can't get back in position. 
[03:22:00]  I really don't want my ass smelled on radio.  Well, you're going to have to.  Believe me.  Not enough money, Opie.  Come on.  We move on, and then we do other stuff.  You're not going to do it on the Food Network.  I said, Kate, you're wasting time, then.  You could be doing cool stuff.  This is just a quickie.  Yeah.  Let's go, Iraq.  Because then we get into the song and the promotion.  Okay, come on.  Hurry up.  All right.  Look, see?  She pulled them down.  Come on.  Nick, look.  Open up, Sandy.  Come on.  I'm not opening anything up. 
[03:22:30]  You have to.  I'll throw you $20 more.  Wait, she pulled her pants up again.  We had them.  I'm telling you, man.  All right.  You don't have to open up your ass.  Come on.  It smells.  Believe me, it smells with the clothes.  $20 more.  Here's $20 more.  Okay, $20 more.  Wait, no.  Don't give it to her.  $20 more.  I'll give it to her.  She won't steal it.  All right.  I love Jim Newark.  All right.  Pull your pants down.  But you're going to open it up a little bit.  Come on.  Just open it up a little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Come on.  Open it for Iraq.  He actually likes one.  What are you doing later?  Let's exchange blood tests. 
[03:23:00]  Not yet.  Not yet.  Let me ask you a question, Sandy.  Now, why are you self-conscious about doing this?  Yeah.  Why?  Because she wants to move on to other things.  I understand that.  Yeah, thank you.  So get this done, and then we play a song, and then we promote.  Okay, hold on.  The new thing you're doing.  Go ahead.  And I wanted to play something when I was 20 years old.  I recorded a song.  All right.  We'll play that.  All right, cool.  It's about the Louisiana Purchase.  Oh.  What happened?  What happened?  Put money in there.  Louisiana Purchase.  All right.  Come on.  Let's go.  All right, here we go.  Get down there.  Open it up, too.  E-Rock is going to smell my asshole. 
[03:23:30]  All right, let's go, E-Rock.  So what do I do?  Pull him down.  Pull him down, fucking silly goose, and open him.  You pull him down, you spread him, and E-Rock sniffs.  Oh, God.  You guys are nuts.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Get in there.  Oh, shit.  Ah.  Oh, man.  What's the matter, E-Rock?  What's the matter, E-Rock?  Does it smell?  I mean, it's not good.  What's the matter, E-Rock?  It doesn't hit at first. 
[03:24:00]  It gets, wow.  Oh, it's got a little aftertaste.  It's like a TV show.  It must be my preparation age.  Must be my preparation age.  We heard you.  We heard you.  We heard you.  Preparation age pump.  It's a pository I just threw in there.  Oh, did you?  You threw a nice face.  You don't have a hemorrhoid.  Oh, that's a shame.  I know, it's a shame.  So how was it?  Yeah, what was it?  Dried blood.  Nick has lost his, he left the station.  It's his omelet, man. 
[03:24:30]  E-Rock.  Yeah, yeah.  A little, like, queasy.  Queasy.  E-Rock, what do you got?  It smells like old dog shit.  It's really bad.  Old dog shit.  Like if you were mowing a lawn, and then you just hit it.  Let me just smell.  All right.  Let me smell my own ass.  I'll tell you.  I smell your own ass.  How are you smelling your own ass?  Describe that.  Smells great.  Stick your finger, like, rub your asshole with your finger.  You smell it, and then E-Rock smells it.  And then E-Rock, you got to smell a finger.  Rub your asshole with your finger. 
[03:25:00]  Make sure you get it good.  Don't touch E-Rock, though.  Now, E-Rock, quick.  Don't let it wear off.  All right.  Let E-Rock smell your finger.  Go.  Smells like Rich Voss's ear.  E-Rock made a sound that I've never seen him make.  He's like the mummy.  I like it.  Jimmy, you think he got a good smell?  I don't know.  No, I don't either.  I have a great smelling asshole.  My teeth are still chattering from there.  That's awful.  E-Rock didn't get a good smell.  You got to shove that finger up a couple digits in there. 
[03:25:30]  Let's go.  Where's my song?  Okay.  Yeah, we're going to give you your song.  Get your finger in there, Sandy, or I'll fucking cut it off.  That's right.  Feels really good in there.  All right.  Take it out and let E-Rock smell.  I want to hear that noise again.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Come on.  Your hand's all wet.  Don't.  E-Rock.  Get closer.  Rich Voss's ear smells worse.  E-Rock.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  E-Rock looks like a pelican that ate some sewage. 
[03:26:00]  Except he's fatter and that smells worse.  I'm so glad you're back, Jim.  The fucking faces and noises he makes.  What does it smell like, E-Rock?  Good radio.  Good radio.  Fuck you, Jimmy.  What does it smell like?  What does it smell like?  It smells like shit, man.  You shit from your ass.  That's it.  What does it smell like?  It smells like death.  That's horrible.  Okay. 
[03:26:30]  What does it smell like?  Shit.  Yeah.  No, that's worse than shit.  That's a medical problem.  Okay.  All right.  You want to bring the interns in?  No.  Hey, come on now.  Sandy Kane, here's the deal.  Sandy.  No, you get $40.  Now, listen to me.  We're going to bring the interns in, okay?  And we want you to work over the interns and talk to them and comment about each intern  you see, what they could do to improve their appearance, which one you'd bang, which one  you would let. 
[03:27:00]  I remember the last time she washed her face.  Yeah.  Oh, Nick.  All right.  Sandy Kane, Sandy Kane's looking at the interns.  We got five of them in studio right now, including Angry Matt is in the corner.  He's angry.  Oh, shit.  Hi, Matt.  Hi, Jim.  I like the haircut.  Actually, you look better.  Yeah.  That was for, what, a job, right?  Yes.  You didn't get, so now you're going to grow the hair back.  I was attempting to become a board operator here at Sirius.  What happened?  Why didn't they hire you?  You had the wrong haircut for that.  Yeah.  They said, they did the interviews, but there's going to be another round. 
[03:27:30]  I've been talking to some people back in the interview.  They should give it to you.  I know they should, but.  Well, you're not angry.  You're actually pretty talented.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Say to Kay.  They didn't like the fact that you're fucking, you have no bend to your calves at all?  No.  They didn't like the way it was a straight shot from the floor up to your fucking teeth?  Say to Kay, work the room.  You got the intern.  Well, he has a nice cleft fucking chin, anyway.  What?  You like?  He has a fucking cleft.  You like him?  I wonder if his dick has a cleft.  I just wondered. 
[03:28:00]  Well, ask him.  Does your dick have a cleft?  I'm just wondering, because it runs in my family to have clefts.  You know, I just wondered if his dick has a cleft.  All right.  We heard you.  Enough about the clefts.  Okay.  Okay.  Matt?  Okay.  I'm just curious.  Get it.  Why does this transgendered person want to know about my penis?  Oh!  She's all a woman.  What are you talking about?  Transgender?  Yeah.  Does that mean, like, I'm a transsexual?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Good one.  No, some of my greatest inspirations have been transsexual, so God bless him. 
[03:28:30]  It shows.  Yeah, okay.  Oh!  Okay.  All right.  I don't want him.  No.  All right.  You don't want him.  Move on.  No.  I just don't like being put down.  Okay.  Like the rest of society.  No.  Oh!  He is angry, though, boy.  I would not hire him.  Oh, he's angry.  Easy.  He's actually in a good mood today.  Don't get on this kid's bad side.  Wow.  Watch out.  No, I'm trying to say he looks good with the fucking cleft, but that's the only good thing 
[03:29:00]  he looks good.  Oh!  No.  Wow.  I'm sorry that my tits look better than yours.  Oh!  Holy shit.  Let's see your tits.  Whore.  Wow.  Bigger than the naked cowgirls.  Oh!  Hey!  A double fucking whammy right there.  Big titties.  At least he has big titties.  Pull the mic out, Sandy.  Stop leaning in, you fucking know-nothing.  Thank you, Jim.  You a hottie, you.  She's touching titties.  Fucking hottie in the fucking house.  Get the fingers out of the asshole.  Fucking hottie.  All right, Sandy Kane, you want to move on to somebody else? 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, we got the one, Ed Sullivan over there.  Ed Sullivan?  I mean, Ed Munster, he looks like.  Ed Sullivan.  Sorry.  Boom.  Ed Sullivan.  Very good show.  Okay.  Good.  Is that my arms are crossed?  Yeah.  Remember?  Okay.  Wow.  So what do you got to-  Right next, a girl with a mushroom on her pussy.  Are you laughing or getting fingered in the arm?  Okay.  All right.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  But this guy, he's cute.  He's kind of cool, man.  I mean, with a haircut.  Would you?  Nice haircut.  Would you fool around him? 
[03:30:00]  Well, would I fool around with him?  Yeah.  Would I fool around with him?  Gee, would I fool around with him?  I don't know.  Would you suck his dick?  Can I see it?  No.  Okay.  He's a little modest.  How about if it was big?  It was probably small.  That's why I don't want to show it.  Oh.  Wow.  You can't see my dick.  Okay.  All right.  Hey.  Hey, small dick.  That makes it sound like-  Small dick.  In the house.  Does that mean you don't want to or you just can't see it? 
[03:30:30]  Fucking small dick in the house.  Okay.  Small dick.  But let's see your tongue.  I mean, that's really important.  Nice.  Long.  You like his tongue?  Why?  It looks long and kind of like he was very excited about putting it out.  I bet somewhere in the ground, Anna Nicole Smith looks just like you.  Oh, shit.  And she had 20 tits, too.  Yeah, yeah.  I got that going for you.  I know.  I know. 
[03:31:00]  Let's go.  Move on to the other guys.  You got Evan and Pierce.  Okay.  What's the next one?  This is Evan.  Evan in the fucking house.  Evan likes to-  Jimmy, our new thing with Evan, he likes to ponder a lot.  Oh, I thought it says Bush.  It's Rush.  He ponders.  It looks like he's pondering.  He's just a blithering idiot.  Listen to Evan ponder.  Go ahead, Sammy.  He's a nice-looking man, you know?  Yeah.  Very cute.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, and he's just very cute.  And so he has a beauty mark over here.  And I wonder if his dick has a beauty mark.  Why are you laughing at that? 
[03:31:30]  He doesn't.  Okay.  Yeah, where's the-  Hey, bruised tits.  What do you think about him?  He has that big titties, like the first one.  What, you get hit by a bus?  He has that big tits.  Wait, like the first one?  Matt, comment on that?  She's still talking about your big tits.  Paprika.  I know titties.  I'm just perplexed by this alien in the room.  Studying like a fucking asshole.  I think clever.  Wow, he is.  He is clever and angry.  He is angry because he can't get laid. 
[03:32:00]  If you haven't been laid in 20 years, you would be, you know.  Exactly.  Oh, man.  That's where you see Matt in front of the fucking Elaine Bryan soon.  It's not easy.  Come on, looking like him.  Oh, Matt, comment.  What can I tell you, man?  I'm just being fucking honest.  Apparently so.  All right, hello.  Wait, wait, Matt has a comment.  Yes, Matt.  I just, I, I got nothing.  Come on, baby.  Come back with something.  Well, she beat your ass.  That's right, fucking Vinny Vincent's really giving you a beating, Matt.  I want to see. 
[03:32:30]  Just please walk out in 49th.  You can get hit by a bus.  Okay.  Oh, damn.  This is going too fast.  This is like a big man.  My blood will be on your hands.  On your fucking dick.  All right, so I'll keep it tight at sea.  All right.  Oh.  Oh.  Double bowels blazing.  Okay.  Do people ever look at you down in Times Square and say, hey, Farrah, could I have an autograph?  Oh.  No, they say I look like Dolly Parton.  Oh, okay. 
[03:33:00]  No, they don't.  Dolly, I get Dolly all the time.  No, they don't.  All the time, really?  Yeah.  All the fucking time.  No way.  All the fucking time.  I walk out in the street, Dolly, Dolly.  Yeah.  And then they walk with their German Shepherd and Kane back to the other side of the street.  Well, you think she looks so hot, Dolly?  No.  The old lady.  Come on.  She is.  Come on.  She doesn't look so hot.  Come on, man.  And fucking phony titties.  Right.  Everyone with phony titties.  Fuck them.  Yes.  That's what I say.  Hello.  Hello.  What about Sam there? 
[03:33:30]  Sam.  Look at Sam.  He's a doll, man.  He's a doll.  You love Sam, don't you?  Sam came out to Times Square twice to see me.  Yeah.  And he'll always be in my heart.  Really?  What would you do with Sam?  Well, I really like him as a person, you know?  It's the mind thing.  He'll always be in my heart.  And I just think he's a...  In my heart.  And for $40, it'd be in your ass.  And I just think it's a mind thing.  And he's just, you know, he's like a...  He's a mover.  I've seen him move up in Syria and, you know, with you guys. 
[03:34:00]  You've seen him move up?  From where to where?  He was an intern.  Intern to glorified intern.  More than that.  He has his own countdown show.  He's a camera-operated Aussie.  That's not his own countdown show.  It's our show.  And he's just...  In case he's camera-operated, by the way, it's my camera, too.  Still.  Not even his own fucking camera.  Yes, mine broke.  Yes, it broke.  But please give me every bit of tape.  I think Sam is a mover, and he might be sick. 
[03:34:30]  I wish you were.  That's what he does at night.  All right.  You know, and he's just...  All right, enough.  We got it.  You're good.  You're like Sam.  Why do you have so much glitter on that part of your titty?  What are you hiding under there?  What kind of growth?  It's like you were changing the oil on a fucking...  Paprika.  All right.  Yeah, it's Paprika.  You like that, right?  Paprika.  What about the two other guys there?  That's Rust.  How's it going? 
[03:35:00]  I'm good, are you?  That's Rust.  It's like getting better than the other one.  What do you think?  I don't think what we go together.  On mic there, Sandy.  On mic.  You think we go together, me and you?  What do you think?  I don't know.  What do you think?  Like, he's angst.  What type of sex do you like?  Not in the back of a horse and buggy.  Back of a horse and buggy, man.  Girls around my age.  Do you like pilgrim sex?  What kinds?  What kinds?  He said with girls his own age.  Oh, oral sex you like? 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, sure.  A lot of men like older women.  Yeah.  The naked cowboys go with an older woman.  Older, not ancient.  Older.  Yes.  A little distinction there.  Exactly.  What's the best could happen?  He starts dating you.  You guys have a couple good dates and shit.  And you're fucking dying about six months.  You do one move.  And he's heartbroken.  Indiana Jones moved to a rock and there she was.  Dying six months, Nick.  You look healthy.  That's a dumb statement.  You're right.  Yeah.  How old are you, Sandy?  Spit it out.  Can you keep a secret? 
[03:36:00]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You never ask a fucking lady her age, Nick.  I'm not asking a lady her age.  That's the point.  How about a clone?  Come on.  Use your imagination.  Well, I am imagining.  All right.  Do you remember?  I picked you turning a play with it.  I'm younger than Angela Lansbury.  She's dead.  Oh, that's impressive.  No, she's just been on Broadway.  Are you younger than Angela?  I thought she's dead.  She's not dead.  Angela Lansbury?  She was just on Broadway in a show. 
[03:36:30]  She's like 90 years old.  Yeah.  So you're what?  89 and a half?  I'm younger than her.  Huh?  Do you remember World War II?  Do you?  A little bit?  Not into wars too much.  I'm not saying into the war.  What were you, USO girl?  I saw her staring through a barbed wire fence at A&E.  I saw her perching a flag on Iwo Jima.  She was shot down with Ted Williams.  Teddy Roosevelt jerked off into her face behind a hill somewhere. 
[03:37:00]  She blew Neville Chamberlain.  Oh, my God.  Nothing better than History Channel humor.  She was waiting for Custer in his tent.  He went, fuck it.  Let's just go fuck with the Indians.  That's really poorly worded.  Custer's last blend.  Oh.  All right, Santa King, why don't we get your song on?  Because we're running out of show.  What about one of these guys?  Oh, my God. 
[03:37:30]  10.30?  The last guy.  Time flies when seeing these guys.  Too bad you can't take your dick sound.  Time flies when you're seeing dung.  No dick.  No dick.  No dick.  I've got to see dick.  Except for the late tippy Tom.  Nice.  And the late tippy Tom.  You jerked off the late tippy Tom.  The limp tippy Tom.  But, well, he's stiff now.  Yeah.  Oh, poor tippy.  You know he's dead, right?  You know he's dead.  One of your, two of your fans came and told me. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Tippy Tom died.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  As he died from the smell.  You jerked him off.  I was great.  You sucked his dick, too?  You sucked his dick.  You sucked his cousin?  Yeah, please.  No, man.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  He was the worst smell in the world.  Really?  Yes.  Ricky Rock will have to have a...  Oh, God.  He really...  Was that the worst?  All right.  Sing a song.  Yeah.  What song are you going to sing?  Let's see how you make your money out there in Times Square.  Okay.  Get your guitar.  Sing a song.  And what do people come up to you?  And what do they do? 
[03:38:30]  You mean this guitar?  Yeah.  I know.  Yeah, that's it.  You're going to touch that?  Don't you dare.  Nine.  Okay.  Are you handing it over?  Okay.  Hello.  Don't you dare hand it over?  Yeah.  Just don't fuck with my baby.  All right.  I can't even do this.  Could you do this?  I'm not going to fucking touch it.  Thank you.  Oh, Jesus.  Thank you.  What the fuck's on it?  It's greasy.  Why is your guitar greasy?  She just had her fingers up her ass and she played a song.  What do you expect?  That is literally a fretboard. 
[03:39:00]  All right, Sandy Kane, you get to play whatever you want because you were good to us today.  All I can say is, in Times Square, being the naked cowboy, and this is why this bitch  didn't make it from the Midwest.  The one with the nice perky tits and smooth skin.  Yeah, fuck her.  I'm glad she went back there.  Yeah, no schtick.  So, you know, you just go over to people.  She didn't need one.  It's just like, she did because she wasn't there.  You know, she's not there anymore.  No, but the whole thing is, it's all a hustle.  It's all going up to people.  She still has that anti-establishment 60s.  Oh, I know.  It's like a strip.  It's like a strip.  Really, huh? 
[03:39:30]  She's still walking around like it's the opening to the odd couple.  Like Manhattan looks like that.  That's right.  I worked in that club at the beginning of the album.  Really?  The Metropole.  Where Oscar looks in the hole in the window.  Yeah, one of the girls, Mandy, that I work with was in that movie.  No.  Oh, the movie.  She died 41 years ago.  Mandy.  Of old age.  Yeah, she was 71.  She was 71.  Amelia Earhart's mechanic.  No, I work with her.  So, like being the cabbie was just like a strip club. 
[03:40:00]  You walk over.  Fucking.  No, because we used to have to sell champagne to strangers, man.  Did you?  So, same shit.  Hi, you want to buy a picture, you know?  Want to buy a picture?  Want to buy a picture?  All right.  I just find it fascinating that the 60s stayed with her out of all the decades she's been through.  Yeah, yeah.  The fucking acid must have just melded it into her.  Right there at the 60s, that's where she stopped.  Could have been anywhere.  Yeah, and I'm really making a lot of fucking money, man.  Yeah, I can tell you're fucking rolling in it.  The 12s.  I bet I make more than you. 
[03:40:30]  Oh.  Now, wait a minute.  I did 14-5 last year in comedy.  Don't tell me.  Comedy sucks, man.  I'd rather have to try it.  Well, that you do have right.  Comedy sucks.  All right, she's going to sing something.  All right, here she goes.  Okay.  Wow, yeah, tuning is so overrated.  What a gift.  What's wrong with your guitar?  Wow.  Fine.  It's got ass cheese all over the strings.  Oh, no.  Something was.  Did someone untune my fucking guitar?  Do you not untune a guitar?  When you were playing your own asshole, I fiddled with it.  No, before I was good. 
[03:41:00]  Go ahead.  Let's play.  Come on.  All right, let's play.  That's perfect.  That's good.  All right.  Good night, everybody.  It sucks.  Okay.  It's terrible, man.  It's an attitude.  Oh, you should tune that.  That's weird.  You know, you can tune a piano, but you can't tune a fish smelling pussy.  No, really, this sucks.  Okay.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, nah.  You know.  Yes.  O.B.  I mean, Anthony is a really great singer, by the way.  People don't know that.  Thank you, Sam.  Everyone knows that.  A lot of people.  Everybody in Massapequa knows that.  Exactly.  He's a fucking great singer.  Everyone at the karaoke shithole down in Mineola. 
[03:41:30]  Exactly.  That's how I kick ass.  Yeah, I heard that.  That's right.  I heard that.  A place where mullets are mandatory.  Yeah, let's see.  It's really fucking attitude.  Is it?  Yeah.  Sounds fine to me.  No, it's horrible.  La yearn.  That sounds pretty good.  Let's go.  Okay.  I'm sure people, the phones are lighting up.  It's out of tune, but, you know, this is the O&A show.  Yeah.  Okay.  I just want to do a song for O.B. and Anthony that I did that I really never.  Okay, Springsteen, get to it.  What the fuck? 
[03:42:00]  Exactly.  Jesus Christ.  And then my father didn't like my long hair.  Then I'm going to stretch out mushroom pussy.  It's fucking out of tune, man.  I don't know what we're talking, Bruce.  O.B. and Anthony.  Guys, I love your show.  Good.  I love to fucking give you guys both a blow.  Good job.  I need you so.  And, ooh, ooh.  I listen to your radio show every morning.  With Jim Norton, too.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  And I'd like to give him a blow, too. 
[03:42:30]  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  And Nick DiBolo's on the fucking show now.  O.B. and Anthony.  Meanwhile, I heard you bring it back.  Whip it out Wednesday.  It's on the street.  What a coincidence.  She wrote this for today.  And I know what.  Really, I hear you bring it out.  Whip it out Wednesday.  I'm out.  Whip it out fucking Wednesday.  Where you whip your titties out.  Ooh.  I remember doing a lot of whip it out Wednesday.  Is that a retarded backup singer?  Yeah.  I'll tell you what.  It beats 30 by Twisted Sister. 
[03:43:00]  That's so exciting.  She's called 90.  She's looking back.  I've been to fucking titty school.  And he failed miserably.  I want to thank Sam for coming out to fucking Broadway and saying hi.  And I know that I will get by.  And I want to thank the fucking naked cowboy for inspiring me every day.  I hear he has a big dick and a long tongue to oi-vee. 
[03:43:30]  She throws an oi-vee in.  That is out of fucking tune.  But, you know, I can't do it to any folks.  I know.  It ruined the whole song for me.  I think you did a great job.  Matt, you like that song?  Matt had to.  I was looking at her oatmeal body the entire time.  Oh, wow.  Come on.  She looks good.  I know I'm a fat mess, but at least I admit it. 
[03:44:00]  I don't have to dress like a whore to get in people's approval.  He doesn't dress like a whore to get in people's approval?  Yeah.  That's right.  Well, baby, look at you, man.  It looks more like a barrel.  Oh, a barrel.  That is true.  A barrel of anger.  He's angry.  Oh, look out.  Sure is it.  Sure is.  I'm sure he's going to go on a diet after today's show.  Oh.  I'm going to eat a cheesesteak in your face.  Just eat pussy, baby.  It's not Benny.  Not yours.  What?  There's cheesesteak in it. 
[03:44:30]  This is a barrel, man.  I'm physically queasy.  I mean, he's really out of fucking tune.  I'm physically queasy.  Yeah, that is really.  I want everyone to come to Times Square, 46, and see me as a naked cowgirl and take a photo.  You should stand in front of the black Israelites and play your song.  Take a fucking photo.  Photo.  Photo.  Photo.  All right.  We got to go, Sandy.  Sandy, nice job.  A great appearance by Sandy Kane.  They're telling us you have to go.  Yeah, why don't you leave?  Hey, why don't you just, I just want to say, when I was 20, when I was raped by Phil Spector  and Richard Pryor, when I was hot in the hottie. 
[03:45:00]  Pryor was two when you were 20.  Okay, so anyway, but anyway, I had a song out on MGM Records.  1920.  The guy that managed me managed Billy Joel, and he got Billy on Columbia, he got Sandy  Kane on MGM.  Billy had Piano Man, I had He Taught Me How to Love, and I brought a copy.  Wait, we got to hear this.  It's from 1984.  Are you kidding me?  Go ahead.  Want to hear?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  It's called He Taught Me How to Love by Sandy Kane.  And I'm looking to go back to Nashville. 
[03:45:30]  1984, so you had just turned 78.  EMI Music publishes it.  I bet you she was, uh, Phil Spector, I love you.  He raped her.  I love you.  Here we go.  Here we go.  That's you?  It's not her.  Get the fuck out of here.  That's not you.  That's you singing that song?  Yeah, it is.  It's not you.  Okay.  Is that really you?  Yes.  Would I lie?  Yes.  Would I lie? 
[03:46:00]  Jesus, you sound like a...  Would I lie?  All of a sudden, he's like a 78-year-old Jew lawyer.  Would I lie?  I'm just saying.  Oh, it calls crazy for questioning that that's you.  It's me, man.  When I get back from Miami.  You know what I think would be good?  We'd play the original 1984 version.  It's only two minutes long.  And then you'd do a brand new one right here.  Oh, so you can hear what it sounds like.  I demoed it.  I demoed it.  And Steve put it on.  I just went to the studio.  Where did you record it?  Inside a dirigible?  In PPI Studios, man.  Dan Soho.  PPI.  PPI Studios. 
[03:46:30]  PPI.  You pee.  You can't do what Jimmy likes.  Pee in a club studio.  No.  It's that in Soho.  Soho, man.  And I just did it in Sandy Cain now.  All right.  Sandy Cain from...  Phil Spector kills the other broad and lets her live.  Yeah.  Yeah, right?  Sandy Cain from 20...  Oh, boy.  I fucked him.  That's why.  Yeah.  Oh, she wouldn't fuck him?  Yeah, she wouldn't fuck him.  Come on.  That's why you give him love.  Sandy, we're trying to give you a big spot here from 25 years ago.  Thank you, sweetie.  It's called He Taught Me How to Love.  Sandy Cain from 1984. 
[03:47:00]  How old are you?  Yeah, it's fair.  It's a country and western.  It's a country and western.  He taught me how to love.  He showed me what to do.  He taught me how to love.  Don't sing to it yet.  Shut up!  I want to hear it.  The harmony. 
[03:47:30]  Ah, fuck the harmony.  I want to hear it.  She wrote this to her boyfriend, Ted Bundy.  Damn, you almost sound sexy.  I know.  Right?  I bet she was quite a goer.  Wow, she got around then, too.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Jerry.  Jerry.  Jerry from Atlanta.  Yeah. 
[03:48:00]  Jerry Lewis.  We've lost a lot of guys all over the country.  Jerry.  Jerry for Atlanta.  Jerry Langford.  Jerry Langford.  Jerry Lewis.  All right, fine.  Jerry.  Jerry Atric.  The line of the day.  Wow, Sandy.  You know what?  That's not bad there, Sandy Cain from 1984.  That was good.  So what about the 2009 version? 
[03:48:30]  You're a country and western singer?  Yeah, baby.  Lucky us.  We got the 2009 version in front of us.  Shut the fuck up.  We're running out of show.  Okay.  Here's a taste of the same song done a mere month or two ago.  Yes.  Who's playing guitar, ain't you?  Not me, baby.  Baby.  Ted, the DJ, is calling her Jaundice Joplin.  Fucking liver failure.  Clapton, sit in.  I got back from Miami.  She's singing over something. 
[03:49:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Right.  Things just ain't been the same.  It's not quite the same.  No.  The voice just ain't the same.  That's the thing that I'm reporting.  Since I met that man, you're happy.  I know how to play the game.  What's the game?  All the innocence is gone.  Stop singing over something.  Yeah, you lost the innocence.  It was all the abrasion.  Why don't you play now on guitar for us? 
[03:49:30]  Okay.  That same song?  Yeah.  Yeah, now let's hear it live.  The live version.  We heard the studio version from the 80s.  84.  The studio version from now.  Now we're going to hear unplugged live Sandy Cain.  They're going to shut us off any moment.  Singing, he taught me how to love.  Hold on.  Nick DePaul has got to get that.  Yes, please.  Comedy shop.  Comedy shop.  It's at a Pinebrook, New Jersey.  Yay!  And then the benefit for the Pauling Fire Department on the 20th.  And all this info is on nickdip.com, right?  I believe so. 
[03:50:00]  Go see Nick.  I've never been to that site.  He's great, man.  Nick DePaul is great.  I have a very quick plug.  I'll be in Wildwood, New Jersey at the end of the month for the weekend at Club Casbah.  I haven't been there in many, many years.  Wow.  Like the 21st, 22nd, I think.  So come see me.  I need the money.  Someone says the only time they want to hear Sandy unplugged is when she's on life support.  Yes, who said that?  God bless you.  That was very good.  That was excellent.  All right.  Go ahead, Sandy.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Since...  No, this...  It's really fucking out of tune.  All right.  All right. 
[03:50:30]  Let's go.  Since I got back from Miami...  This is terrible.  Two more states have been added to the union.  It's really out of tune.  It's really hard.  All right.  Okay.  Let me do the figure break.  Is this added fucking tune?  Come on.  Don't worry about it.  We don't care.  Just get back from Geneseo.  Since I got back from Miami, things just ain't been the same.  It's all desegregated.  It's all desegregated.  It's all desegregated.  It's all desegregated.  Name Anthony, I know how to fucking play the game. 
[03:51:00]  She must have added 15,000 cities to this song by now.  Since I got back from Calcutta.  What happened to that sweet, high-pitched voice we heard?  It's been damaged by a hundred cocks a day for the last 40 years.  And I fucking sucked his dick, too.  Oh!  Is this a Neil Diamond cover?  Yes.  It sure is crackling hip.  He taught me how to chew, too. 
[03:51:30]  He taught me how to suck his car.  They're coming in my mouth.  And he ate my...  What?  Oh, see, that wasn't necessary.  Hitting her in the eye like that.  What's up with you?  Get the fuck up, man.  Stand up, man.  Come on.  Since I got back from...  Come on.  Face me like a man, asshole.  Since I got back from...  Way back from now.  Okay.  Since I got back from New York City.  Mesopotamia.  Things just ain't been the same. 
[03:52:00]  Since I met O.P.U.  Oh, shit.  I know how to fucking play the game.  The game.  He taught me how to screw.  And he taught me how to screw and blew him in the bedroom.  Bedroom.  She's country and western.  She's Jewish.  She's Italian.  She sounds like one of Billy Batson's friends at this party.  Bedroom.  Don't get nervous.  Don't get nervous. 
[03:52:30]  And he ate my pussy.  Through my party.  Too...  Hey, it's out of tune.  There's a guitar behind the toilet in the bedroom.  What?  Why is it fucking out of tune?  It's a box and chain.  Let's listen to God's talk.  For all time's sakes.  Can you get me out of Miami?  I don't want my...  Tell Broadway Danny Rose it's business.  I don't want my brother coming in with just his wig and his genital wore in his hands.  Broadway Danny Rose.  All right.  All right.  We got to get out of here, Sandy Kane.  It was terrific.  Where are you going to be hanging out today?  In Times Square?  Probably a free clinic. 
[03:53:00]  I'll be hanging out, man.  She thought that thing lays it off.  Hanging out, man.  Yes.  And send it to you, baby.  Could you please?  Cool.  Put it in breadcrumbs.  We're out of here for today.  I got a motherfucking go.  It's like a piece of a gallon.  Come on.  My mother used to make the best general warts.  General warts.  She breaded up with some egg.  Just put it in the pan.  Oh, my God.  My dog.  It melts in your mouth.  You're chewing like a pencil eraser.  We all put it between our molars and chew it and pass it around.  Sometimes I went to places like a rubber bands. 
[03:53:30]  The galamah.  This genital war galamah melt in your mouth like my mother.  God bless her.  God bless her.  Smells like an underarm.  Look at her.  Yeah.  Why didn't you show me that fucking thing?  The secret actually, before you breaded, you put your fingers in your ass so you get  gold-ass grease.  And then you rub it in a mud on.  Rest in peace.  Mingy, Mingy.  Look, look.  Yeah, Mingy.  Okay.  And here she comes with a fucking camera from God. 
[03:54:00]  Why not just have a gunpowder on a fucking platform?  Okay.  We got to go.  We got to go.  Okay.  Come on, baby.  She's got a disposable camera.  Let's go.  Yeah, put your finger right in front of the lens.  We got to go.  How can a guitar get herpes?  She's now taking pictures with her throwaway camera.  What about Nick?  Oh, Nick, of course.  Yeah.  All right.  Take your pictures.  We got to go.  We got to go.  You a hot man, you. 
[03:54:30]  All right.  All right.  We're going to just turn off the mics.  I blew him outside Stan of New York.  All right.  All right. </pre>
