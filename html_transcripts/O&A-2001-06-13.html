<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of their "Whip 'em Out Wednesday" promotion, encouraging listeners to display "WOW" signs on their cars.  Melissa, a show employee, described the varied reactions in Philadelphia, ranging from hostility to enthusiastic support.  Listener Stephanie then shared her personal experience with the promotion.  Studio guests Amber (from *Survivor* and *Stuff Magazine*) and Kimmy (*Survivor*, *Stuff Magazine*) joined the show.  Their conversation revolved around their *Stuff* photoshoots, their *Survivor* experiences, and rumors about their relationships and alleged sexual encounters with other cast members.  Their physical appearances and the impact of fame were also discussed extensively.

Ted Nugent then joined the broadcast. His appearance primarily focused on promoting his hunting business and his *Stuff Magazine* column, punctuated by crude jokes and sexually suggestive remarks. He discussed his views on hunting, including hunting with terminally ill children.  The presence of a 20/20 film crew filming the segment was mentioned, causing some anxiety for the hosts due to earlier off-air conversations with Kimmy.  This portion of Nugent's appearance included a discussion of his musical preferences (mentioning NSYNC and Britney Spears while disparaging a band with a drummer named Buford), and anecdotes about his early career, including a performance opening for Leonard Skinner at Madison Square Garden in 1978.  He engaged in heated debates with several callers who criticized his hunting practices and his "smug attitude," defending his views on hunting, gun ownership, the Second Amendment, and his work with organizations like the Ted Nugent United Sportsmen of America and Mothers Against Drunk Driving. He promoted his book, *God, Guns, and Rock and Roll*, his website, and his new CD, *Full Bluntal Nugity*.

The show featured a "What's in My Pants" segment with a female caller from Philadelphia, where the hosts guessed her pubic hair style based on sounds.  They also discussed the "WOW sticker stop" event at a New Jersey Toyota dealership (with the 20/20 crew present), Amber's buttock photo on foundrymusic.com, and the Olsen twins' birthday.  Pat Croce, Philadelphia 76ers executive, then joined the show, recounting his eccentric promotional stunts (including climbing the Walt Whitman Bridge) and sharing an anecdote about his brother stealing money from Allen Iverson. Jim Norton was also in studio and contributed to the conversation, providing additional details about the theft.  Numerous phone calls followed, discussing the "WOW" stickers, Babe Fest at a Philadelphia club, and Amber's photo. A song about "Whip 'em Out Wednesday" was played.

The final segment involved a contest where Lola, a female participant, was "tarred and feathered" (with honey and feathers) for Backstreet Boys tickets.  The process was described in detail, with much crude commentary from the hosts and guests. The show concluded with discussion about cleaning Lola, additional crude jokes, and promotions for Sam Adams beer and other products (Stacker 2, Ultimate V, Sipperstein's).  A prank involving covering Lola in feathers using a fan was documented, with concerns (often sarcastic) about her breathing difficulties due to the feathers. The footage was intended for WNEW.com and FoundryMusic.com.  Further listener calls followed, with callers sharing their thoughts and jokes.

You have sorry.  Wow.  Social proof.  Boom.  I see boom.  Boom.  Yes.  You just got wowed.  Wow.  Hey.  They look amazing.  That's nice.  Bothy and Anthony.  Hey, yeah.  It's world renowned.  Whip them out Wednesday. 
[00:01:00]  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Those are real.  People are important.  Oh, yeah.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  Yeah.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Oh, wow.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hello.  Hello.  Hey.  I'm going to be honest.  I don't know what the hell is going to happen today. 
[00:01:30]  We have not prepared for today's radio show.  Per usual.  But even more so.  Well, we have an excuse for today.  Right, Anthony?  Yes, we do.  The fine folks from 2020 downtown just interrogated us for the last hour and a half.  Interrogated?  It was an interview.  Oh, oh, that's what it's called?  An interview.  That's right.  I think it went pretty well, huh?  I think so.  We'll see how they edit it. 
[00:02:00]  They could do a lot of things with editing.  Sure.  I think the piece is going to run sometime in July.  Is that what they're telling us?  Really?  That long?  Yeah, right?  July?  July.  Is she giving...  She's giving us the finger.  Look at that.  Well, that's because you're saying interrogated.  I just got the finger from someone from 2020 downtown.  That's an interrogation.  But it has just begun.  We have finished the interview. 
[00:02:30]  They talked to us for an hour and a half.  They'll use maybe four minutes of it.  That's how it always works.  Sure.  Now, one of their crews is heading down to our WOW sticker stop.  Oh, great.  So, we want all the freaks to show up for that.  Earl's going to be down at Toyota of Hackensack, 278 River Street, Hackensack, New Jersey.  Earl's supposed to be there at four.  We'll see what happens with that.  I don't even think he has left yet, right?  Mm-hmm.  But, guys, your chance to get on a national TV show. 
[00:03:00]  Get down there.  Yeah.  And get your WOW stickers, and there'll be lots of fun to be had.  Go on down.  That's right.  The lovely and talented Melissa's outside the studio.  Melissa, come on in here.  See, people don't think we really know her, because we're now on in Philly.  That's right.  W-Y-S-P, the whole gang down there, they're fully aware of Melissa and what she can do.  Hey, nice N-E-W shirt.  Nice.  I've never seen a warrant like that before. 
[00:03:30]  Holy.  Like it.  Like it.  We've got to get baby tees made.  I know.  I need an Opie and Anthony shirt, guys.  What's going on with this?  Wow.  I'll get one made, all right?  I'm going to try to look into your eyes.  Holy ass.  We learned a while ago Melissa's job is to just look hot when she comes to New York, right?  Uh-huh.  I think she needs a raise.  She's doing her job.  Right.  Come on.  So, uh...  You guys are in with Ken Stevens.  Yes.  You were in Philly yesterday?  All right. 
[00:04:00]  All right.  We got a raise and we didn't even have to look hot.  Oh, we did the opposite.  That's right.  So, uh, what's the reaction in Philly so far, Melissa?  All right.  It's, it's...  At first, it was really bad.  Right.  But getting 50-50.  I've been out in the public.  I was at the U2 concert last night and, uh, there were some pretty people that came up  and they were pretty brutal.  But then there were some people that came up and actually got into this huge confrontation  right in front of me and completely defended you guys. 
[00:04:30]  Nice.  Look at that.  We love brawls.  And I happened to be sitting next to one of the interns in the office yesterday and he  was reading stuff and I thought he was cracking up because of the stuff he was reading.  So, I'm like, what's so funny?  He's like, these guys, I love them.  I've been listening to them for three days and I absolutely love them.  Three days.  Look at that.  So, you won over a YSP Philadelphia intern.  How do you feel about that?  I've been on for four.  Why didn't he listen the first day?  Yeah.  He's done four shows so far.  Sorry.  So, you're heading out to the Wild Sticker Stop? 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, I'm going to go down and see everybody.  Nice.  Everyone, nice turnout for the camera cruise.  Let me tell the listeners, who cares about 2020 downtown?  Go to the Wild Sticker Stop to see what Melissa's wearing today.  Come on, guys.  You're making me blush.  Oh, yeah.  You know you're hot.  Well, I'm going to go down and down.  You realize you're hot, right?  What is that like?  Do you just walk around and go, God damn, I'm so hot?  Do you just wake up in the morning?  I thought I got this job because I was really good with people and smart. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, that too.  Yeah.  Good PR person.  Good with people that think you're hot and people smart enough to know you're hot.  We just want to know what goes through the mind of a hot chick.  Do you wake up in the morning and just get naked in front of a mirror and just go, wow,  I'm so effing hot?  No, that's not quite ever happened.  No?  No?  I don't put outfits on all morning long and see which one looks the best.  Do you wake up and go, oh, I can't wait to see myself naked? 
[00:06:00]  Man, if I had a body like that, I wouldn't need to do that.  If I had a body like that, I would never leave home.  Get all worked up that you're ready to go into the bathroom and look in the mirror.  Why do you leave home?  There's no reason.  You got the hot body.  You can just stay home and have fun.  I just got into a car accident, right?  It's because these guys completely ran me off the road.  See?  That's what it's like.  It's not all that much fun.  Oh, stop.  Getting cackled at and, you know, screamed at and ran off the road. 
[00:06:30]  That rules though.  Does your body turn yourself on?  I need to know this stuff.  We'll talk about this later.  I'll wake up in the middle of the night and go, oh, I'm just going to look at myself naked.  Right.  Just a little bit.  You know, I've got to get up again and see myself.  It's been a couple hours.  I just want to know what goes through a girl's head that is this hot.  All right.  Well, I got this new camcorder and it flips both ways, you know?  So you can look at yourself as you're taping yourself. 
[00:07:00]  So I have been seeing myself a little bit more than usual.  Wow.  Any of those tapes available to the public?  We'll see them.  Melissa, who's good with people, will be at the Wow Sticker Stop with Earl at Toyota  Hackensack, 278 River Street, Hackensack, New Jersey.  We're expecting a huge turnout today.  The cameras will be rolling for 2020 downtown.  So help us out with that, right?  Be there to see Earl.  Thanks, guys.  Now, Melissa, does Philly know what Whiffle My Wednesday is all about?  No, I don't think you've really announced it yet. 
[00:07:30]  Oh.  I've had some people that cross over that listen to both that know about it.  Right.  But I don't think everybody knows what it is.  Okay.  Well, we're going to have to enlighten them.  Well, we should enlighten them now, Anthony.  Right.  You know, you will never, well, you won't find Anthony and I bragging about much on this  radio show.  Not much to brag about, Anthony.  No.  But we will brag about Whiffle My Wednesday because we truly believe that this is the  greatest radio promotion ever invented.  Ever, ever, ever. 
[00:08:00]  Everyone's involved.  Everyone can be a winner.  There's no other radio promotion where everyone can win.  No, there's usually one, two winners maybe of something.  Not with Whiffle My Wednesday.  We are ready to describe the greatest radio promotion ever.  Yeah.  Ever.  Mm-hmm.  Are the bumper stickers ready yet in Philly?  I call them getting design.  They look really cool.  I don't know if they're exactly ready yet.  We're going to have WYSP WOW bumper stickers for Philadelphia. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  Anthony, explain WOW to Philly.  Here it is.  You take WOW in any way, shape, or form.  You can write it on a piece of cardboard.  Put it in your rear window of your car.  If you have a truck, a big rig, you just rub it in the dirt on the back door.  You could take a bag of those lousy WOW chips and just put it in your back window there.  Doesn't matter.  Or if you get a bumper sticker, one of the WOW stickers, you put that on your car.  Now you drive.  That's as easy as it is. 
[00:09:00]  That's all you've got to do.  You drive around, and you could be the winner of gazing at beautiful breasts like Melissa's while you're stuck in traffic.  You're stuck in traffic.  A girl that also listens to the show drives up.  She sees your WOW sticker or WOW sign that you made.  She then pulls up next to you and flashes those beautiful breasts.  If she likes.  Of course.  We don't force the ladies to do it.  We don't want the guys harassing the ladies.  This is all the stuff that New York understands. 
[00:09:30]  The girls love to do it.  Yeah, there's plenty of girls out there that are willing to do this.  So ladies in Philly, if you will, if you feel inclined, help us out today with Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Okay?  It's been a huge success in any of the markets we've been in, in Boston and here in New York.  And all you do is put it on.  And that's it.  It's not like one of those things you put a sticker on your car or a van spots you.  You have the opportunity to enter a contest where you may win.  No. 
[00:10:00]  Nothing like that.  You put it on.  You drive.  And before you know it, you'll just be driving.  You'll forget about it.  You'll forget it was even there.  Then one day you're in traffic.  You're driving.  And you turn to your side and you're like, why is this girl showing me her beautiful cans?  And then you realize, oh, it's the WOW and it works.  That's right.  That's right.  W-O-W.  Whip'em Out Wednesday.  So until we get bumper stickers in everyone's hands, you know, the best way is to just make a  homemade WOW sign and put it on the back of your car.  And we'll see what happens, okay? 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  I mean, right off the bat, we've got Stephanie on the line.  Stephanie.  Yes, that's me.  Good afternoon.  Good afternoon to you, too.  My little darling.  You got an accent.  Yes, I have.  Yes, I have.  Good of you to notice.  Don't cause it's a toll on your accent.  Yeah, it sounds like you're from the South.  I've been, I go up and down the thruway every day in my white Honda with yellow trim.  I'm just looking and praying for WOW stickers, signs, and I think I'm ready, willing, and 
[00:11:00]  able, and I just can't see any anywhere.  You can't see any WOW stickers, huh?  No.  So far this season, since you started this season, two times I've been able to do it.  The guys were over the moon, but I want to do it more.  All right.  I want to do it more.  I want to do it more.  Good power.  Please, sir.  I want some more.  Stephanie, you got a nice set?  Um, well, grumpy is kind of showing his ugly face, but you know what? 
[00:11:30]  Do you guys really care as long as they're there?  See, that's it.  It doesn't matter.  All shapes, sizes, various degrees of sagging, doesn't even matter.  Yeah, it just makes your day.  I don't care.  I don't care how they're there.  It makes my day.  When I do a WOW to a guy, and he has a smile on his face, it makes my day.  Put it this way.  A lot of guys are also prohibited by their spouse.  Right.  From going to strip clubs and whatnot. 
[00:12:00]  We've heard it before.  These guys are pussy whipped or something.  They can't go to the strip club.  They have probably not gazed at live breasts of another woman, other than their significant other, in years, Opie.  Years.  This is the opportunity now.  They put a WOW in their car, and they get to see foreign boob.  Boob that is not that of their wife or girlfriend at home that doesn't allow them to go to strip clubs or any other opportunity to see breasts.  There you go, Stephanie. 
[00:12:30]  Exactly.  How many times have you walked past a restaurant and looked at the menu through the window?  It doesn't mean that you're going to go in and order.  Well, thanks.  But you just have a look at the menu.  What's the spouse's problem?  Look at Stephanie with the analogies.  Thank you, Stephanie.  It's my pleasure.  Listen, guys, I love listening to you.  You make my time driving around and in work really bearable.  All right.  Keep up the good work.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  There she goes, Stephanie with the English accent, waiting and willing to WOW.  She's just looking for a car with WOW on the back of it. 
[00:13:00]  See, guys?  There it is.  The ladies are out there, and they're willing to do it.  As you know, WOW.  That's Amber from Survivor.  Good.  Wait.  God.  Let me see that.  Good.  God.  Look what a shower could do.  She's in stuff.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Hey, first of all, I want to know where that chick is because I'm coming up out of Philly on the Northeast Extension.  I want to know where she is looking at WOW at the truck driver or anybody.  Yeah, she said on the thruway, I guess. 
[00:13:30]  It's going to take some time for Philly to catch on, but we'll start with today, and hopefully we'll get some guys putting WOW on the back of their cars today in the Philadelphia area.  I've been with you guys since day one out of New York, man, and it's fantastic that you're down in Philly now.  I live in PA, and I just got to thank you for giving us a whole other state of boobs to look at.  Yeah, the truck drivers have got to love the fact we're getting syndicated.  No, you wouldn't believe, I mean, how much, like you said, we just write it on the back of the trailers. 
[00:14:00]  You would not believe the response.  All right.  You guys are the best.  Right on.  Thank you, Bob.  All right, later.  All right.  Sweet, merciful crap.  She looks great.  Amber?  Amber from Survivor.  Is she outside the studio?  Oh, she's not.  We're going to have Amber from Survivor in the studio in minutes.  She's on the cover of the latest issue of Stuff Magazine.  Unbelievable.  Oh, I know.  Dude, look at the pictures.  Oh, I know.  Unbelievable.  When was she on Survivor?  What show was that?  I missed the one that this girl was on.  No, you didn't. 
[00:14:30]  Whoa.  Wow.  Okay.  Sorry.  She was in the latest one, obviously.  Oh, there's Amber.  Wow.  Hi.  I got to say.  Amber, look what it is.  You look great.  Thank you.  Did you have any, were you nervous doing this or anything?  Um, no, no, not at all.  It was totally so fun and just had a good time with it.  Yeah.  We're in shock because they just handed us this.  You don't say you're not a pretty girl or anything. 
[00:15:00]  I'm just saying the way they, like, made you up.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, my makeup and the hair.  You got that eye makeup on.  That's like, ooh.  I like that look after the girls, maybe they've been out all night.  They were crying.  And it's all smudged and stuff.  And it's all smeared and stuff.  I like that look.  You like that look.  You had a great look?  No?  They didn't warn you about us, did they?  We don't bite.  Don't worry.  And you're all, like, greased up.  What did they put on you?  Like, just oiled just to make me look.  They oiled you up?  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  That's good.  Do you usually wear makeup or are you just like, because today I see you got no makeup  on or very little.  Yeah, I use, this is what I usually wear.  Yeah?  That much eye makeup I don't usually put on, but.  It really brings those peepers out.  Anthony Embers from Beaver, Pennsylvania.  Yes.  There's the gag.  No, I'm not even, I'm just saying, Beaver, Pennsylvania, it's a small town.  Does mom and dad approve of these shots?  Yeah, they love it.  Yeah, they should.  They did some good work.  It's not a bad thing.  No.  Look at what we're just gawking at her in the magazine. 
[00:16:00]  This is horrible.  I know.  We're barely looking at you.  You're sitting right here.  And we're just gawking.  I feel bad, like a pervert over here.  Well, because we should have seen this before you got in here, but we were busy and we weren't  able to prep.  She's got those great above the hiney dimples.  You got those things there?  Those are good.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Those two dimples.  I didn't even know that they were there.  How do you not know that?  What are you talking about?  You're making our guests very uncomfortable, Anthony.  Look, see the dimples just on the lower back? 
[00:16:30]  There's the two little dimples on each side of the...  Those rules.  Girls have that.  That's good.  Girls have that.  I see a quote from you as I open up the Stuff magazine.  No, it just says, I went twice in 33 days.  I really don't know what that means.  I swear.  Is it to the bathroom?  Yeah.  You went twice in 33 days while you were out there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Isn't that nice that they decided to include that quote?  Yeah.  How did that work?  You just didn't have to?  No.  You're not eating anything, so... 
[00:17:00]  Wow.  Jesus.  I'm sorry.  I'm still...  No.  I mean, all you eat is like a couple bites of rice in the morning, a couple bites of rice  at night.  That's it?  Did you lose weight?  Yeah.  Because you're a thin gal.  Yeah.  I lost like 15 pounds while I was out there.  Yeah.  And believe me, I gained it all back.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I ate like a mad person when I got it.  I'm sure the girls love hearing that in the audience, that you're skinny and you can't gain  weight.  I got to ask Amber something.  Yes.  How stupid is Colby? 
[00:17:30]  Don't give the politically correct answer.  He's not stupid.  Come on.  I want one of you guys from Survivor to say he did a stupid thing.  No, listen.  He has had...  I think he had a plan from so long ago because now he's viewed as America's sweetheart.  The nice guy gave it to Tina.  But if he wouldn't have done that and chose to have Keith beside him, people would have  thought bad about him.  Like, oh, Colby, that...  Well, but in New York.  That's already right.  And it doesn't matter.  Yeah, he's going to end up winning his...  He's going to get a million bucks out of this.  Right, right.  But in New York, we just look at him as a dumb Texan. 
[00:18:00]  I got to tell you.  Yeah, but I mean, I think it's one of the smartest moves he could have made.  Because, I mean, look at Richard Hatch or whoever it was last year.  They don't view him as nicely because he made, like, you know, strategic moves like that.  Well, because America's scared of gay guys.  But it's a game show.  Right.  It's a game show.  You got to, you know, go to win.  Yeah, I mean, it's obvious that he would have won if he, you know, would have voted Tina  out there.  Yeah, totally.  But he knows a million bucks, honestly, he's going to get it anyway, so he didn't care.  Right. 
[00:18:30]  You know?  Any other magazines approach you to do anything?  Well, obviously, the Playboy has had to approach you.  Had to.  Yeah, they did.  And you decided no?  Yeah, I decided no.  I actually didn't even want to hear how much they're offering because I would be afraid  that if I knew, I might be tempted.  Yeah, so I decided not to do it.  And I just think right now it's just way too drastic for me to do that.  Yeah?  Too big of a move.  I don't know.  You should have heard what they offered.  Because I'm thinking if you even would have thought about it, that you probably might, 
[00:19:00]  you might do it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, you got the goods.  Hey, what do you think, what did you think of Kimmy from Survivor?  Actually, I didn't even get to meet her until the very last show in L.A.  Right.  So I never even met her.  I don't even really know her that well because that was the first time I ever met her.  She's wild.  You think she's a bitch like we do?  No, she's not at all.  She's a sweetheart.  But I mean, like I said, I don't even know her very much.  But I know that you get the whole whipped cream bikini thing.  Yeah.  Oh, did you see the pictures of her?  Yeah.  What did you think?  What did you think of Kimmy's body? 
[00:19:30]  It's not like Amber's body.  No.  We'd like to get you in a bikini, a whipped cream bikini.  You got a little bit of cash from stuff, right?  No, I didn't.  You didn't to do that?  Mm-mm.  Wow.  Seriously?  Yeah.  To be the cover girl like that?  They don't pay you for that?  What's wrong with those people?  Tell us her a couple of bucks.  Kimmy.  What are you guys doing talking all kinds of nasty stuff?  I was trying to set Amber up, but she didn't go for it.  See, she likes you.  Amber's nice. 
[00:20:00]  Hi, Kimmy.  Hi, sweetheart.  How are you?  I'm great.  How are you?  Good.  I saw your little photo shoot on E! today.  Did you?  Yeah, it looked good, or whatever those shows are.  Yeah, whatever the shows were.  I haven't even seen them, so...  You haven't seen the actual issue of stuff?  When does this come out?  Any day now?  It's out.  It's out.  She shows more skin.  I'll go pick it up.  She shows more skin in a bikini than you did with the whipped cream on you.  What the hell's going on there?  You didn't even show any hiney dimples.  I know.  Well, you know, Jeff was being very, very discreet, whereas he placed the whipped cream and all. 
[00:20:30]  Right.  You guys know where I am?  Yesterday, I just had my eyeballs lasered, so now I can see everything.  You did?  For real?  Yes.  I had LASIK surgery yesterday, and guess what?  I just drove to the doctor's office, and I can see.  Oh, my...  Well, were you really blind?  I didn't know that.  I had it done, too.  Did you feel...  Yeah, I'm pretty blind.  I see.  Well, I was blind.  Wait, how long did it take for your eyes to, like, clear up?  Wasn't it blurry first?  Yeah, just because of the anesthesia drops they put in your eyes?  Oh, that's...  That's the only reason. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, it was because of that.  And then I took the Xanax, and I just kind of, like, slept all day, and I woke up, and I could see.  Yeah.  So, like, I drove today.  I had surgery yesterday.  How weird is that, like, to wake up and all of a sudden be able to see everything?  It's amazing.  I see 2015, though.  I'm so excited.  I've worn glasses my whole life.  Wow.  I love that.  Yeah, because 18 years I had glasses.  Right.  Like, I was, like, a little nerd.  But, Amber, oh, my God, I wish I knew that you were in.  I would have come out and said hello.  Well, it's been such a quick trip.  I've been, like, busy, and I'm leaving today, so...  She's leaving.  Did you wow the guys?  She's not like you, Kimmy. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, she's a nice girl, so we're not even going to ask her.  She doesn't have a dirty mind like you.  Yeah, we know the difference between you and Amber, Kimmy.  Kimmy's the wild one that, I swear to God, anytime you hear a story, it's like, we hear  that a couple of members of the Survivor 2 cast were in a bathroom having sex at a club  in the city.  We're like, Kimmy, Kimmy.  No, but it still wasn't me.  I think I figured it out.  It was Sean from the first one.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that's who it was, because Sean apparently is his dirty dog, but that's what I heard. 
[00:22:00]  I can't say one way or another, but that's what I heard.  Yeah, but, Kimmy, like, you haven't done it in a bathroom at a club?  No, I really haven't.  Come on, if I'm going to do it at a club, I'm doing it right on the bar.  You know me better than that.  Why would you go in the dirty bathroom?  Yeah, I know.  That's got to be the worst.  Hey, Kimmy.  There's something hot about that.  Yes, Amber.  Hey, Kimmy.  Yeah.  Are you jealous of Amber?  Why?  No, she's great.  She's on the cover of Stuff Magazine.  What are you doing?  Don't try to make them fly. 
[00:22:30]  What are you doing?  I'm going to get a cat fight going on here.  Because they're awful.  Hey, Kimmy.  You're being terrible.  Mitchell's mad at you.  What did I do?  Because he wanted you to go to that charity event with him.  You didn't go.  No, I had a different charity event for diabetes instead.  Oh.  Are you doing this whole charity tour thing?  No, I'm very selective as to which one I'm going to.  I'm going to another animal one in, like, two weeks.  Oh, that's right.  You're like the poster girl now for animals.  I know, but it's so cool because I get so many, many things.  Oh, but.  You don't wear any leather, right? 
[00:23:00]  No, not really.  Not really?  Wait, wait.  Do you wear any leather?  In shoes.  Hypocrite.  Some of the shoes have leather pieces.  Hypocrite.  Leather pieces.  Very little.  Very little.  What do you think?  They just carve a little off the cow and send them on his way?  The bolt goes right through his head, too.  I know.  That big pneumatic bolt hammer goes.  Oh, my God, stop it.  You're going to make her cry.  It's really hard to find non-leather.  I got to tell you, Amber, now you know why you weren't on our show when you got kicked off. 
[00:23:30]  They protected you from us.  I know.  We weren't allowed to talk to the wholesome girls like Amber.  But you know what?  Amber has to go and, like, get in Pennsylvania and start up, like, the wow, bigger stop there  and rally up the truth.  Well, something tells me she's not going to be as close to this program as you, Kimmy.  Well, maybe.  I mean, we could turn her here.  Rally.  Turn her.  What are you, Satan?  Yeah, why not?  It's like a cult.  Amber, is this you?  What is that?  That's me.  What happened there?  Oh, is that the Amber Tishy shot? 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, it is.  It's not.  Well, yeah.  Amber, and I remember when you did that because I jumped up on.  And who the heck put it on the Internet?  I'm going to kill that person.  You've got a really nice behind.  Where was that?  I think it's Kimmy was there.  It was in L.A. at CBS.  It was on our way to take David Letterman.  And what's so funny is that I did it so quickly.  Like, you really could barely even tell.  But when they put it on the Internet, they slow it down.  Of course.  And they put graphics around it.  And, yeah.  Wait, so you guys were getting ready to go on Letterman? 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  And this is, what, in the break room or something?  Because I see a vending machine in the background?  We're getting ready to get on the elevator.  Okay.  It's walking through the hallway.  And who had a camera?  Oh, Jesus.  Jeff Varna had a camera.  It was for the early show.  And he was like, I dare you to moon me.  I'm like, all right.  So you mooned Jeff.  And then how did he put it on the Internet?  He didn't.  Whoever.  Oh, yeah.  It gets out.  Somebody at the early show.  Yeah.  Somebody at CBS put it on the Internet.  Don't worry, Amber.  If you can moon Jeff, then you can wow. 
[00:25:00]  You can wow it'll be an answer.  You shouldn't be ashamed.  That is very nice.  Amber, that Internet thing, it's a fad.  It'll go away and the pictures will fade away.  It's a fad.  Right, right, right.  You should see the footage we have of Kimmy.  Oh, come on.  You do not.  Oh, yes.  We got some great video of you.  But we're friends with you, so we haven't done anything with it.  Thank you.  There was times when the whipped cream was completely gone and melted off your body, and we had video rolling.  Well, no one remembers what happened after she came out with the whipped cream bikini.  She laid down, and then we started firing water guns at her, washing away the whipped cream. 
[00:25:30]  Which, according to the stars on tabloid, became a super soaker.  I'm like, look, it was like a little three-inch water pistol.  Super soaker.  Super soaker.  You're not supposed to read those things, Kimmy.  She was in it.  I do, I do, because I've got to know what I'm up to, because every week I'm up to something new each week.  So I'm like, hey, what do I do?  Yeah, but what's some ridiculous rumors you've read about yourself?  Not true things. 
[00:26:00]  That Colby and I were caught in the bathroom.  Really?  You two?  But everyone was caught in the bathroom with Colby.  Well, in one magazine that said it was Alicia and Colby, and then another magazine that said it was me and Colby.  In one magazine, actually, the newspaper said it was you and Alicia that were getting together.  Oh, really?  Canoodling, Kimmy?  Were they canoodling?  I believe they were canoodling.  When was this?  This was like two weeks ago.  It was after the party that we had with CBS after that big thing.  It said Alicia and I were getting... 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, you and Alicia, and you guys were responsible for a girl getting fired.  What?  Wow.  At where?  At scores.  She got fired?  Who got fired?  One of the dancers at scores, because the two of you were getting a little frisky with her.  Oh, my God.  Oh, shut up.  That is not the rumor.  That is so not true.  Really?  Amber, did you ever have sex with Kevin James of the King of Queens?  You know what?  I think I have a really bad connection. 
[00:27:00]  Ever?  No?  You and Kimmy don't have that in common?  I want to ask Kimmy something off mic, because I heard something new about her.  What?  You heard new stuff?  But you know what?  Well, because we really do...  We do consider her a friend, and I don't want to wreck her life.  All right.  You want to go to the music?  Yeah.  Do we have our...  Kimmy?  Yeah.  Sometimes...  No, not real music.  Like that, we are experiencing technical difficulties.  Please stand by music.  Kimmy, you got my word.  I'm taking you off the air, okay?  Okay.  Thanks, Hope.  All right.  Hold on.  We'll be back. 
[00:27:30]  I'm going to get your reaction on the air, though, I think.  How can we do this?  If I do this, right?  All right.  Hit the music.  Kimmy?  Yes.  Yes.  I'm not saying anything.  You speak.  I say nothing.  All right.  We're back.  Wow. 
[00:28:00]  Thank God you didn't say that on the air.  Holy Jesus.  How was he?  Listen to me.  We're not mentioning any names.  Is that at all true, Kimmy?  Oh.  We have so much dirt on you.  Listen to me.  Some people could be married, okay?  All right.  That's what I was just saying.  All right.  Oh, you little hula.  That's a winner.  If I didn't know somebody was married. 
[00:28:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I just got to ask Rick.  No one else heard that, right?  Just confirming it did not go on the air.  Okay.  Thank you.  Your question.  Thank God.  Hang on, you guys.  Yeah.  Look, Dr. Passarelli, the doctor that just lasered up my eyeballs, and I just gave my free plug on the radio.  You should have used my guy.  I would have got, ah, whatever.  All right.  Well, I can see.  Oh, my God.  Could that cause some problems?  Yeah, it could.  I'll come in next week.  So, I'm going back to Dr. Passarelli in Brentwood and Seville.  All right.  Why don't you take that home-wrecking laugh of yours and keep it under wraps every so often. 
[00:29:00]  You're filthy.  Goodbye, guys.  Goodbye, Amber.  Goodbye, Kimmy.  I'll see you guys later.  I'll call you guys next week.  All right.  Bye.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  She loves it.  Can you believe that?  Look at Amber.  Kimmy is the wildest chick, man.  She is.  She is wild.  No, she is.  Have you slept with any celebrity since you've come to famous?  You've probably met a lot, right?  No, I have met a lot, which is pretty cool.  Yeah. 
[00:29:30]  And he'd take a shine to you?  Of course they have.  Look at her.  Yeah.  I'm dating somebody right now.  Oh, you are?  Is someone famous?  Is he famous?  No, no.  Actually, I met him in college.  So we've been together for a while.  Oh, that's cool.  Good.  Good for you.  What is the wildest thing that has happened to you since becoming famous from the show?  The wildest?  Or the coolest thing.  Yeah, because you're just kind of thrust into the limelight.  Because you're a girl from Beaver, Pennsylvania, and next thing you know, everyone knows you.  What is the coolest thing that has come from this?  You're going to think this sounds so lame, but the last time I was up in New York, Jack 
[00:30:00]  Hannah and all those animals were staying at our hotel, and they're going on David Letterman,  and I got to take pictures with leopards, and it was awesome.  Oh, cool.  Cool.  Did you have a cute little monkey?  Outside of Survivor.  What?  Did he have a cute little monkey?  No.  It's a legitimate question.  It wasn't an innuendo or anything.  Uh-huh.  You know how sick we are?  I swear.  You know how sick we are in New York?  There was a time Jack Hannah came up with all his animals, and they were stolen from his hotel. 
[00:30:30]  What?  I swear.  And he went on Letterman with those.  He was in complaining and stuff.  I don't know.  Yeah, because it ruins his gig.  What's he going to do if he doesn't have animals?  Yeah.  Are you for real?  I swear.  It was a big story.  That's awful.  Someone took a couple of, I don't know, the crates or whatever the animals were in.  Yeah, they're in these cages, and I feel so bad.  They're in this hotel room and all these cages, but...  That's their natural habitat, the leopard.  Yeah.  A hotel room.  Yeah.  They love it.  Yeah.  All right.  Do we have to get you out of here?  Is someone saying you have a plane to catch?  Yeah, I'm leaving.  I'm flying off LA. 
[00:31:00]  Did we horrify you?  Did you have fun?  Not at all.  I will never, ever, ever come back.  Yeah.  I know.  We knew that was going to happen.  God.  We were nice to you, though, right?  No, you guys are awful.  Kimmy won't go away, and then we can't get...  No, I'm just joking.  No, you guys were great, but you really weren't that nice to Kimmy.  Kimmy is such a good friend of the show.  She's been on so many times, and we love her.  No, we really do love her.  She knows that.  She's done some great things for us.  Well, I doubt she'd keep calling back if she didn't like you.  No, that's the problem.  She does. 
[00:31:30]  She keeps calling.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  Look, she's horrified again.  Hey, Jim Norton.  Norton.  Norton, that's Amber from Survivor.  Hi.  Nice.  Hi.  Look at the one you just gave me.  Isn't it great?  It's Uncle Fester with a rocket in his pants.  By the way, the TV crew is 2020 Downtown.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They're doing a little piece on us today, so you might have to deal with that being on.  Okay.  Oh, my God. 
[00:32:00]  The cameras were rolling when I asked Kimmy about...  Oh, man.  Uh-oh.  They'll have to cut that out.  Oh, no.  It was off the air with 2020 Downtown cameras.  They're all like...  Oh, ass.  Hey, you guys won't use that, right?  Oh, my God.  Make some sign of the alarm.  Holy...  I'm freaking out, man.  Hey, it's out of our hands.  It's not our show.  Hey, I didn't say it.  Yeah, but Kimmy...  Kimmy didn't know the cameras were there.  Oh, my...  We have to make a deal, man.  Yeah.  I gave my word.  His name is Opie. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  His name.  Oh.  I forgot about the camera crew.  Yeah, why should only two markets have heard it?  When the entire country can see it, hear it.  Holy F.  I just F'd up really bad.  That's all right.  No one knows.  Real bad.  No, no, no.  Nobody.  You didn't know...  We had Kimmy on the air, right?  Yeah, I heard that coming.  And we heard a rumor.  A certain rumor.  A rumor that she might have had sex with somebody, so we asked her off the air.  Off the air, going... 
[00:33:00]  I give my word, I won't put this on the air.  She didn't say yes or no.  I forgot about the TV crew.  The cameras taped it, yeah.  The camera crew taped it.  She didn't say yes or no, but you could tell kind of it was a yes.  Yeah, I know.  We learned Kimmy speak, which is like...  Yeah.  That's how we learned the Kevin James thing.  She just laughed and giggled, though.  You believe that?  She said she had sex with Kevin James.  King of Queens.  They went to school together.  All right.  We should let Amber go.  She's starting to sweat.  Yeah.  Gosh.  So, we highly recommend you go pick up Stuff Magazine. 
[00:33:30]  Pick up Stuff?  You're beautiful.  Thank you.  Great job.  We love the magazine to begin with, and with Amber on the cover looking all nice.  Yeah, it is a cool magazine.  Yeah.  Guys love it.  Jim, any final words for Amber?  Nice.  I knew you were going to say that.  Yeah, horrible.  All right, Amber.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Good luck.  I know she has to catch her plane, so...  Yeah.  Run.  I'm out of here.  Run for your life.  Run.  Run.  Are you now going to leave the studio and just go, Jesus Christ, why are you booking 
[00:34:00]  me on this crap?  Are you bummed?  I think it went great.  You okay with it?  All right, good.  Yeah.  Are you from Stuff Magazine, though?  I'm from Stuff Magazine.  Oh, that's why it went great for you.  This is Mary.  Yeah, you should have seen when the CBS rep was taking all the Survivor people around.  They would just leave going, you're never again, ever, ever going to get a guest.  We'll be back.  Absolutely.  Who was that?  Who was...  What's her name?  Sam.  Doesn't matter.  We're screwed already.  Say it.  Deb.  Deb.  Oh, yeah, Deb.  Deb loves us.  No, no, no, no.  I meant who was taking the... 
[00:34:30]  Who from CBS was taking the people around?  Do you guys know?  Well, Deb set up the interviews.  You weren't allowed on our show.  You or Elizabeth will never, ever be in here.  They've made sure Elizabeth and you weren't on our show.  They think I'm like five years old that I can't talk to people or something.  Pretend you are at times?  Oh, Jesus.  Thornton.  Despicable human being.  Our interview with Jerry was interesting, to say the least.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, because we just don't like her.  You don't like her. 
[00:35:00]  Just like everyone else.  Kind of let it be known.  You guys all get caught up in the editing, so...  Is that what it is?  Yeah, I mean...  Did something happen that day and then was edited to make something you didn't look different?  No, no, I mean, she said the things she said.  I won't deny that.  But, I mean, if you guys got to hang out with her at a bar and had a couple drinks, you guys...  She's great.  We would like that.  If she ever gets to New York, we'll have to do that.  I like anyone in a bar after a few drinks.  It doesn't matter to me.  All right.  All right, guys.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  Bye.  Take care.  We have to take our first break, Anthony.  Jim Norton in the studio.  Of course.  The lovely Amber Lee in the studio.  Ted Nugent coming in today, Anthony. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  And also...  The Motor City Madman.  Also, Pat Croce.  Yeah.  One of the owners or the president.  I don't really know what...  What?  Yeah, I know.  He's the president of the Sixers and he owns a tiny piece of the franchise.  We're going to get him on the phone.  He climbed a bridge today, Anthony.  It's a really, really good story.  Yeah, I know.  He's a lunatic.  This guy is out of his effing mind.  And, of course, it is Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Yeah.  The first time this is happening in Philadelphia. 
[00:36:00]  I'm very excited about that.  So, guys, make sure you put wow on your cars.  And, hopefully, the ladies will flash in today, right?  Yeah.  I'm going to turn the mic on outside the studio to hear Amber's reaction to the interview.  Hold on.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Jeez.  I thought it was...  I thought it was good.  She looked like she had fun.  Okay.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show in just a bit. 
[00:36:30]  Opie and Anthony.  WNEW.  Anthony Diamond Vision and Dr. Philitop.  Look at that.  We were just talking about the LASIK procedure.  Kimmy had it done.  Opie had it done.  You've got to go to a pro.  Someone who's done a lot of these.  Dr. Philitop.  He's done over 6,000 surgeries.  The guy went to Harvard and Yale.  Dr. Philitop treated Lawrence Taylor, Tiki Barber, and, of course, Opie.  I've got to thank Dr. Philitop because of my fine 2015 vision.  Yeah.  I was able to see Amber's nips popping out of her top. 
[00:37:00]  Opie.  Like it was...  Oh, what?  Be nice.  No, it was nice.  Nice, girl.  Just nice, girl.  But it was nice.  Nothing wrong with, you know...  Don't let fear prevent you from what you want to do.  It's simple.  If you want to see without glasses, call Diamond Vision.  1-800-984-2020.  Experience sports without glasses this summer.  For residents of Long Island and the five boroughs, you get the LASIK procedure.  Only $750.  Anywhere else, it's $1,250 per eye.  The lowest price is around.  1-800-984-2020. 
[00:37:30]  Call them right now for a free consultation.  1-800-984-2020.  Opie and Anthony.  Wow!  1027 WNEW.  Fuck!  Yeah!  Yeah, you son of a bitch!  Fill your hands!  Now, I know, in all this confusion, you're probably asking yourself, can you fire five shots or six?  I've got to tell you, in all this intensity, I've lost track myself, so I guess you've got to ask yourself one question. 
[00:38:00]  Do you feel lucky with the...  Oh!  Yeah!  Ted Nugent.  In the studio, Anthony.  I love that guy.  Do you get a kick out of him?  Do you get a kick out of him?  That's all I want to know.  Well, sure.  Well, then get over here and bend over and drop trowel.  I'll show you a kick, you son of a bitch.  How are you?  He's a little...  Good.  Good.  Good son.  God bless you.  We're acting like we know each other.  That's good.  I like that.  That's my middle name, Anthony.  Theodore Anthony Newton.  Yeah. 
[00:38:30]  Good name.  Good name.  Good attitude.  He's a little mad at us because we're...  Because you're gay.  No, we're not gay.  Well, if you don't see my column in the Damn Stuff magazine, you're definitely losing manhood.  We're looking at Amber from Survivor.  She did a photo shoot and stuff.  And then Ted's wondering why we didn't see his etiquette column.  I have an etiquette column in Stuff magazine.  I write for 48 publications, including Razor and Stuff and American Spectator and all your  favorite hunting magazines.  But we look at the TNA in Stuff magazine, not in Oracle. 
[00:39:00]  Put some barbecue sauce in your balls.  It'll all go away by tomorrow.  Ben Murphy from Brooklyn in this column wants to know how long he should let a Cabernet breathe  before indulging.  What do I say?  And you...  Is this the kind of questions you answer on these people?  I do an etiquette column.  You got a problem with that?  I find that all good maitre d's put forth the extra effort to uncork the vino about 20 minutes  ahead of time when hunk-a-hunk-a-burning Ted comes to die.  If you fail to train the server at your preferred restaurant to adequately know these important  special touches, then his sorry, flimsy, no doubt, a vegetarian ass will be zero help 
[00:39:30]  to you when it comes to beverage enjoyment.  So if you don't have 20 minutes to spare, try this.  Shake the bottle thoroughly, uncork it, and drink it right from the bottle.  If the wine needs to breathe, gargle a mouthful for an extended period.  And if the wine needs to be held, do it.  I'm against public displays of affection, but not with bottles.  Why?  Because they double as weapons.  That's why.  There you go.  When in doubt, whip it out.  I got me a rock and roll band. 
[00:40:00]  I'd rather take a look at Amber, though.  She's looking all hot, isn't it?  Yeah, dinner on the hook.  You know, that's why I wrote Wang Dang, Sweet Puntang, because sometimes, kids, there's  no bag limits.  Look at that.  What is that now?  Is that something else?  That's Amber showing her ass.  Oh, she's in the studio here dropping trowel, huh?  No, that was taken somewhere in L.A., and then, funny enough, it ends up on the internet.  Man, I'd have slid a wafer in there.  You like the internet, Ted?  Like her inner what now?  Yeah.  You like the internet?  I got a TedNugent.com campfire that is nothing short of a spiritual orgy. 
[00:40:30]  Really?  Yeah.  And what's on it?  TedNugent.com, I book hunts.  I have sunrise safaris.  I book hunts all around the world.  I hunt between September and February.  You book hunts?  Yeah, you want to go hunting, Bobby?  Okay.  I heard different than what we see.  I only told you a guy in New York, we go, you book hunts.  What does that mean?  Well, when you said it all in one second.  Right.  You book hunts.  I hunt cunts.  Right.  You have a problem with that?  Not at all.  I understand what you do.  It's a hunt.  Why?  Did you want to book a cunt?  Did you want to book cunt?  You could do it here in New York if you wanted. 
[00:41:00]  I'm just wondering.  You got a problem, book cunt?  This might have to be hyphenated on the radio.  Is that anything like a bookend?  We're talking about hunting, right?  Hunting?  What else could we possibly be talking about?  We're talking about booking hunts.  And of course, if you dial my 800 numbers, which is 800-343-HUNT.  And if you get the H wrong, actually, Michael Jackson's chimp will come by.  That'd be a treat.  Now, Ted, you take a lot of American youngsters out on hunts. 
[00:41:30]  We find that most of our Nugent hunting parties consist of families with young kids.  You know, seven, eight-year-old kids.  They want to learn about the outdoors, the stimuli of nature that has driven Uncle Ted's  spirit into the stratosphere.  And more dynamically than that, that's cool enough, we book hunts in Texas and California.  We hunt deer and bear and elk and moose up in Ontario.  We also book hunts at our lodge in Michigan for white-tailed deer and for ducks and geese  down in Florida for wild hogs and a waterfowl in Nebraska, South Dakota. 
[00:42:00]  But I do it between September and February.  But more powerful than any of those family get-downs, which is pretty neat, is I take  a bunch of terminally ill kids on their very last hunts every year.  How do you deal with that?  I deal with it by looking across the campfire at them and trying to absorb an emotion that  you and I hopefully won't have to face for a long time.  It has to be pretty, pretty dynamic in their young, especially young lives, that they somehow 
[00:42:30]  thought of an old goofy guitar player at the moment of facing imminent death.  And I feel very honored and privileged that they would even consider me.  Powerful stuff.  Look at you out doing stuff.  Well, look at Ted having a heartache.  I know.  Hey, Ted, what was the last...  I'm so wholesome I want to puke.  What was the last thing you killed?  And when was it?  I killed a black bear up in New Brunswick a couple weeks ago.  So the rug has landed.  I had a couple days off.  What's it you?  I used my bow and arrow.  Bow and arrow. 
[00:43:00]  I have a Pearson bow and my own Nugent blade broadhead.  And they have so many bears up there that they're a real nuisance.  In fact, there's been more orphaned and slaughtered sows and cubs in Ontario since they banned  the spring season there two years ago than in the history of that province.  So I'm real proud to be a part of a system by which we guarantee a balanced and healthy  population of these biodiversities.  Well, a lot of the people out there think you're very controversial with this.  No, not a lot.  A lunatic fringe.  If you were on LSD, you'd think I was controversial, too. 
[00:43:30]  So basically, the people who want to go to a Jerry Garcia tonight can't because he's dead.  I guess that would be controversial.  But I guess if you and I put that much poison in our system, we'd be dead, too.  So if that's controversial, kiss my dead dog's left nut and drive safely, but not in the  left lane because I'm in a hurry.  Hey, we should introduce you to Jim Norton.  Yeah, Norton's a good guy.  I had Jim.  Friend of the show.  Nice to see you, Jim.  You can't say it like that.  That's shot put.  That's shot put.  You can't put it that way, Norton. 
[00:44:00]  Oh.  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  I shot a black bear once.  No, you didn't.  I tried to clean my windshield.  Oh, Jesus.  Now, let's go to the racist boogie, you son of a bitch.  I want you to know that I was raised by a wild black man in the Aboriginal forests of Detroit,  and I take that personally.  I want to thank you for that.  Jumping.  Gee-hoes.  Jim Norton, look.  Jumping.  Jumping.  Gee-hoes.  Black boners.  What now?  Get coming right for us!  That's cool. 
[00:44:30]  I like that.  I'm going to stay, do you mind if I stay?  Hell yeah.  I feel right at home here.  You guys deserve me.  You've had your mocha today, haven't you?  Let's go to Frank.  Frank, what's going on?  Frank.  What's up, boys?  How you doing?  Is this that perfectly Frank I've heard so much about?  Of course.  Let me be perfectly Frank.  Frank.  What's up?  Nothing.  I just want to say what's up to Nuge.  Hey, Frank, I'm up, baby.  The ponytail is fully erect.  I just want to say I'm like 23, never got to see a Nugent show, and I'm hoping to come 
[00:45:00]  down to Jersey on Friday and see you.  Yeah, it'll be great, man.  I've got a great band, Frank.  Tommy Clefettos on the drums and Marco Mendoza on the bass guitar.  These guys are so good, it's stupefying, man.  You've never heard a more dynamic exaltation of all things black rhythm and blues by a bunch  of idiot white boys in all your life.  So, yeah, come on by and see us.  We guarantee to stain your soul.  Nice, nice.  I know you're playing with Skynyrd and Deep Purple.  Are you going on first, or what's the deal?  Yeah, I actually do. 
[00:45:30]  I warm up the boys.  I go on first.  It's a tour that's lasting all through the summer.  Deep Purple, I've been watching those guys for 100 years.  They've never sounded better.  They've got Steve Morse playing guitar, who is absolutely stunning.  Just stunning.  Deep Purple has never sounded better.  Leonard Skynyrd is in high-velocity mode right now.  They've got Huey from the Outlaws on guitar, and Ricky Medlock, too.  Incredible virtuosos.  And with the original Skinners, and my own damn Yankee drummer, Michael Cardelloni. 
[00:46:00]  So they have a lot of energy and attitude.  You know, when they follow me, they play really good, and it doesn't really matter.  No, actually, they're doing great.  I like to watch them, and I like the people walking out singing a song to walk to your car,  buddy.  Right on.  No, I'm not.  Frank, you're going to have a great time.  Frank, I guarantee you.  You've never seen Nugent?  No, never, man.  Welcome to America.  When does the rest of your family coming over?  I didn't think anybody had not seen me.  I've only played 5,300 plus shows in my life. 
[00:46:30]  Wow.  It's stupid, isn't it?  How many in the loincloth?  I hope you dropped the loin.  Not dropped it, but I hope.  Let's take a hunt.  I was going to wear a loincloth this year.  I actually went out and got a live badger to hang onto my balls while I was traveling.  But I had a little extra garlic and butter, so I'm wearing regular pants.  Yeah.  What do you think of today's music, Ted?  I think great music.  Dave Matthews' band, a lot of soul.  Anybody with a drummer named Buford isn't okay in my book.  I love the Peppers.  I love Green Day. 
[00:47:00]  I love the new Aerosmith stuff.  And, of course, NSYNC.  I don't know much about those guys, but they definitely got soul.  I mean, my kids like them.  The boy bands?  You're into the boy bands?  I'm not into boy nothing, pal.  Are you into Britney Spears, though?  I think that Britney's got a lot of talent.  I think that Christina gal's got a lot of talent, that Jessica Simpson.  She's got to be fattened up a little, though.  Well, we can slap her around a little.  Yeah, which one would you bag her?  Which one would you bag?  I wouldn't bag any of them because I taught my wife to shoot, and it would be my last bag. 
[00:47:30]  That's a bad one.  She'll catch you running at 100 yards.  Actually, Shemaine is coming in.  She is the queen of my forest.  We've been married 12 years, and she owns my soul and my balls.  Yeah.  Okay?  Right on, man.  Chuck's got a question.  Chuck, what's going on?  Chuck.  How you doing?  Hey, Chuck.  It's not so much a question.  News, first of all, I'm a huge fan.  Thanks, Chuck.  Also a huge fan of Jerry Garcia, mind you.  Well, Jerry was something else.  Also a huge fan of hunting. 
[00:48:00]  But I just wanted to tell you a story.  Now, this is going to take you back a long time.  I love being taken aback, man.  I saw you in concert when you were supposed to be opening for the original Leonard Skinner.  Oh, yeah.  Now, you're talking Madison Square Garden, 78.  When we went on Anyhow, we gave all the proceeds from that concert to the survivors of the Leonard  Skinner families.  Is that what you're talking about, Chuck?  That's exactly what I'm talking about.  And you rock then, and you rock now.  Hey!  When you don't do drugs, you can actually think instead of dying and bloating.  This is true. 
[00:48:30]  You were the opening act when Skinner crashed?  That's right.  We were actually down in Louisiana, and we'd done a number of shows with them.  And we were performing down in Baton Rouge the night they came in and the night they crashed.  News, let me test your memory.  Who opened for you that night?  It's a quiz.  Bullet bites a bone when the bullet hits the bone.  Oh, golden earring?  Nope.  Nope.  Negative.  Uh, uh, uh, what the kid's name who went on to do, uh, classic, uh, C, uh, CD compilations. 
[00:49:00]  Uh, Rex.  That's it.  Rex Smith.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Get out of here!  Get out of here!  Wait, Rex Smith?  Did he say Rex Smith?  No, was it?  Yeah, it was.  Rex Smith?  Unbelievable.  Hold on.  I remember this stuff.  Rex Smith?  I blow my mind!  Rex Smith and the Nuge on the same bill?  My, well, that's nothing!  On the same bill don't mean squat!  The fact that I remembered it, but you guys, you guys should be plugging your balls into 
[00:49:30]  one of these electric sockets!  See, that's astonishing!  I want a bonus and I want it now!  Where's my mocha?  Ken, have you ever done drugs?  No, I'm kidding.  I'll be dead.  I'll just shot y'all when I walked in here.  Never.  Never done drugs.  No alcohol, no tobacco, no, no, uh, nothing.  My idea of fast food is a mallard, okay?  Wasn't Rex Smith the guy who did the I Take Your Breath Away song?  Maybe he took your breath away, pal.  All right.  He didn't take Jack's plot to my ass.  Dude, one last thing.  Yeah, Chuck.  I'm a big deer hunter, but I want to start bull hunting this year. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, Chuck, you get ready for the mystical flight of the arrow.  First of all, Chuck, go to tednugent.com.  That was where I was going to ask you.  Where do I go to get good info?  Well, first of all, you live in a great, great deer hunting state of New Jersey, even  though it's regulated and restricted to the most puking level I've ever witnessed.  I don't hunt you.  I hunt in Pennsylvania.  Well, you'd want to start hunting in New Jersey.  My buddy Doug there and the Sis family down in Bordentown at the Sportsman Center.  They can hook you up.  But go to tednugent.com.  Okay.  We have a talkback that I get on every day three or four times in the chat room. 
[00:50:30]  Every day by today.  And I have my own bow hunting school.  I have my own organization called the Ted Nugent United Sportsman of America.  You can get on there at tednugent.com.  And I tell you, Chuck, all the peace and all the battery recharging that you feel when  you leave the pavement, even whether you're big game hunting with firepower or not, it will  be amplified tenfold when you go out there with the bow and arrow because there's something  extremely primal and it connects you to the spirit immediately when you get out there 
[00:51:00]  because your level of awareness with a sharp stick is at its optimum working level.  It really is.  I mean, it's not like ordering pastrami and having a stranger handle it for you.  Right.  That's precisely why I want to do it.  Oh, great.  Survivor music by some gay pianist.  Where did you find a Rex Smith song?  I thought that's what that is.  You dirty bastard.  That's funny.  I've got to tell you, I've done some amazing things in my life.  Hold on.  He's about to sing, Ted.  That's why I'm playing.  Uh-oh, Ted. 
[00:51:30]  There we fixed him.  Wow, look at that.  You hit the garlic and the butter.  I can't believe I remembered that.  That's exciting.  Yeah.  Ron has something for him.  Ted, yeah.  Ron, what's going on?  What's up, dude?  I can't stand this low-life, hillbilly, white trash loser.  Anthony, are you going to take that from him?  Anthony's a pretty nice guy, man.  I know.  He watches his teeth.  Ted, what do I say to this guy?  You know, him and his, listen to me, his big game hug, you know, terminally ill, he probably  takes those kids, sends them loose, and he hunts the kids. 
[00:52:00]  You loser.  You're such a faggot.  I wouldn't be a good sport, but no.  That's a pretty accurate summation of what I do.  What do you have?  What's your problem with that?  Ron, right on the money, once again, Ron.  Why?  Because anybody that takes hunting to this extreme is just a sick loser.  It's the 19th, 2000 already, dude.  Get out of the frickin' woods.  Hey, hey, dude, man, your pastrami's leaving a stain on your shirt, you know, man?  Like, you know how to do it, brother?  It's like, screw your mother.  Yeah, that's what happened to me.  Hey, what do you call a West Virginia virgin?  A New Jersey virgin?  You're going to go on faster than a brother.  Ron, what's wrong with hunting? 
[00:52:30]  There's nothing wrong with hunting if it's not taken to this extreme.  And first of all, why do you got to hunt some bears?  What extreme is he taking it, though?  Ron, let's talk like we have an education.  What extreme are you referencing?  The extreme is that you've got to make it, you know, the whole focus of your stupid, worthless life.  He sounds very passionate about it.  What's wrong with that?  That's sick.  There's nothing any passionate about you.  You don't have to go to support yourself.  You go and you buy a steak.  You go to Peter Luby.  And what do you think happens to the cow?  They lull him to sleep?  They lull him to sleep and borrow his meat and he walks away and it regrows? 
[00:53:00]  I don't care.  They put a bolt through his head.  I don't care.  The extreme is getting that cow alive stuff.  Hey, Ron, kiss my dead dog's left nut.  Right, second later.  That would be me, the gay guy that takes hunting to the extreme by feeding my family, by talking to Chuck about spirituality.  That would be me, the extreme fag guy.  My critics, I almost feel godlike when my critics get done because someone opened their head while they were sleeping and actually pooped inside. 
[00:53:30]  It's hysterical.  I'll tell you, if I hear my hunting life in summation, I've never bought meat from the store.  I won't let strangers handle my family sustenance.  My hunting life is one with nature.  It's about respecting my intellectual and moral obligation to be a steward of the precious resources that provide all of us quality air, soil, and water. 
[00:54:00]  What is a steward, Ted?  A steward is someone who monitors and manages anything for optimum utility and responsible utility.  And if that's extreme, then write my name down, baby.  And ultimately, when I take these children hunting for, you know, my typical critic like Ron, who is trying to find fault in getting into personal attacks and name-calling,  is just the perfect, perfect example of the people that are against hunting because he's not going to address the issue. 
[00:54:30]  What I do is I take children whose families have ascertained that my reputation and how I conduct myself is a desirable environment for them to have one of their last experiences in life.  Is it true Make-A-Wish won't allow this?  Yeah, I worked with Make-A-Wish for many years.  I certainly salute all the volunteers and anybody who's ever donated to Make-A-Wish Foundation.  They really upgrade the quality of the last of a lot of young people's lives.  So they should be saluted and congratulated and thanked for that. 
[00:55:00]  But an individual, I would not taint all the good men and women of Make-A-Wish by the decision of a couple of individuals who are playing this heartless and brain-dead,  politically correct game, much like what Ron was talking about, where they would not allow a dying child to fulfill a legal wish that tens of millions of other people are participating in,  but some pompous, heartless skirball would actually tell a dying kid, 
[00:55:30]  no, I'm uncomfortable with your requests, so die in pain.  Oh my God.  I mean, there's some heart and soul.  That's my critic, by the way.  So what I did is went out of the Make-A-Wish individuals, again, there was only some heartless individuals.  I love this guy.  That made that callous decision.  I started, I've had the Ted Nugent Camp for Kids, and we picked up the slack along with a great family organization who was turned down by Make-A-Wish 
[00:56:00]  and whose son died without getting his hunt thanks to Make-A-Wish, but instead they started their own hunt of a lifetime.  And again, if people want to find out about this, they can go to tednugent.com, and I'll be taking a young man who I wouldn't talk about.  We're only broadcasting in New York right now, is that right?  In Philadelphia.  In Philadelphia.  That's the suburb of New York.  And that's where you get your beef.  Yeah, exactly.  And I'm taking a young man from California who I had at our concert last week up in Santa Clara, 
[00:56:30]  and this 16-year-old young man is at the end of his therapy and his chemo,  and there's not much time left, and he's going with my family and I to Africa and hunt a wild boy at our ranch in Michigan.  No thanks to Make-A-Wish, we're doing it ourselves.  Nice.  Chris, what do you got for Ted Nugent?  Ted, why don't you just come out of the closet already, man?  Come on, Chris.  Okay.  Come on, Chris.  The guy said he's...  You listen to what Ted said.  First thing out of his mouth, and I, of course, went out and gargled. 
[00:57:00]  I had a gargle.  Either that or his junk is small.  I gargled some barbecue sauce, and it'll be all right.  Chris, do you have a problem with Ted or...?  Yeah, the whole gun thing, the hunting thing.  What was wrong with the gun?  Just the whole smug attitude.  It's just...  Smug?  You're a queen.  I've been funnier than anything in this world since I walked in here.  What's smug about that?  I don't know, man.  That sums it up.  Go ahead and hang up.  He said...  Karma's coming for you, Ted.  I don't know, man.  I don't know, man.  That was his answer.  I don't know, man. 
[00:57:30]  Thank you very much.  Chris, drive safely.  Karma's coming for you, Ted.  You're going to fry.  Yeah, well, karma is coming.  Yes, I must be getting bad karma for taking these poor dying children on their last worship.  How cruel could I be?  Can't you see that my typical critic is absolutely brain dead?  I can never understand that.  Are they not listening?  What do you say to the people that say, are you glorifying guns?  Because I've heard that.  I mean, I don't think they need any more glorifying.  I mean, this country was based on the very premise that we would not be slaves and serfs anymore. 
[00:58:00]  And that when the British came to take our guns after attacking us up the ass,  brave men and women met them at Concord Bridge with guns and shot them.  That's what...  Right.  That's what it is.  I mean, that's why we celebrate the Fourth of July.  What, am I the only guy in Manhattan that knows this?  And I say, no, I'm not.  Because you know what?  I was stopped by two cops coming up here today.  And they both came up to me and he shook my hand.  They said, Ted, thanks for standing up for our Second Amendment rights.  A black guy on the curb over where I got a coffee earlier today came up and slapped me in the back.  He didn't know my music. 
[00:58:30]  But he saw me on Politically Incorrect.  And he said, Ted, thanks for standing up for what my family believes in against that punk Bill Maher.  I know that I don't represent...  Hey, we don't like Bill Maher.  Bill Maher is the biggest clown.  What a piece of crap this guy is.  I make sure I make that quite evident when I'm on.  So I know what I represent.  And my critics, if they really wanted to...  Ted, that's like I was just taking your wallet.  No, I guess I don't think so.  Come on, I'm kidding.  He's still alive, isn't he?  Anthony, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going?  Ted, I got a question for you, Ted. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, yeah.  This morning you made an analogy about Napster and the left hand is the music and the right hand is the receipt.  Yes, sir.  When in your left hand is the animal meat that you just killed.  Where's the receipt?  Well, what's in your other hand besides the gun, you moron?  First of all, Anthony, you're not...  Anthony, man, Anthony, no.  This show is better than Howard.  Say it right now.  All right, whatever.  Is that Anthony?  Yeah.  You think Anthony's still listening?  Yeah, he's still listening.  Anthony, first of all, once again, you guys have just got to pull this out of your ass, don't you? 
[00:59:30]  Anthony, pay attention.  I've said it a bunch of times here already today, but I'll say it again for your failed capabilities.  I hunt with the bow and arrow.  What gun are you talking about?  What gun?  Where's your receipt for the meat?  You didn't steal that?  The receipt for the meat would probably be the land that I manage for thriving, thriving wildlife biodiversity  that the University of Michigan and the Nature Conservancy and the Sierra Club come out every year  to thank me for saving the Mitchell Satter butterfly, which is an endangered species,  and the Christmas tree fern, along with a number of other ferns. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, butterflies are just hard to hit with an arrow, Ted.  No, no, no.  That can be funny, but if we're going to talk to you...  You can't lead a butterfly.  If that's what you do, you don't have to use a 12-gauge.  But my point is that these real conservations come up in my property,  and they say that the reason that these endangered species are thriving on the Nugent Swamp in Michigan  is because I harvest the surplus deer and turkeys and beaver and muskrats  and the coyote and the fox and the squirrels and the rabbit.  These are all renewable resources.  And you never run out of deer on your land? 
[01:00:30]  Run out.  Exactly.  I wish I had the document with me from these conservations organizations  that says I have to increase the harvest of deer on my property by 60% this year,  or it's going to get endangered.  I don't know the names of some of these plants.  I certainly know the Christmas tree fern, which is endangered,  and the Mitchell Satter butterfly, which is endangered.  And on my fin, on my wildlife property, which I manage for hunting...  Well, look at Manhattan.  We're surviving without trees.  That's my point.  And go out and rush out right now and tell me about the survival techniques you've so perfectly honed. 
[01:01:00]  So in the intellectual and final and honest analysis,  guys like Ron and Chris and Anthony...  Well, we've got Mike, too.  They're just missing the whole point.  Mike?  Yeah.  Yes.  What's up, man?  Mike.  Ted, you're a douche.  That's me.  There you go.  There's always the name calling.  The guy so eloquently states his case.  His point.  You want me to say his case?  Hold on, hold on.  And Bubba comes out.  Bubba comes out.  No, it's a douchebag. 
[01:01:30]  I have a case.  Hold on.  You want to hear it?  All right, go ahead.  All right.  Try to be intelligent.  We'll go with the Second Amendment first, right?  Unbelievable.  Well, Mike, may I?  I mean, if you really want to speak intelligently,  have you read the recent Uniform FBI crime report or the ATS study  that has proven that individually possessed and carried firearms in this country  reduce and halt crime and save lives over 2.6 million times?  That's the government's...  And have you read that 80% of deaths are caused by someone in their own family with a handgun?  Not true at all. 
[01:02:00]  It is.  80% of handgun deaths are caused by someone within their own family.  Yeah, in their own crack-dealing family.  Okay, 80% of families are crack-dealing now?  No, no.  Your deaths are all effed up, dude.  Please.  Where are you getting this?  Just keep them coming, Mike.  You're making my point.  God bless you, son.  Remind me to give you a free CD up the ass.  Wait.  Ted put across exactly where he got his information from.  You pull this 80% stuff out of your ass, and you can't back it up. 
[01:02:30]  And we've got to get Ted Nugent out.  It's unbelievable.  That's why we're having fun.  We've got to get him out of here.  All I can say is...  You're doing Fox News in the few minutes.  Yeah, with Paul Azan.  If you really have an intellectual point to make, I would welcome you to come to TedNugent.com.  Or you can contact us at our 800 numbers.  Well, it's only 415, huh?  I'll tell you something quickly, Ted.  I was raised out in California with my father around guns all the time and around hunting.  And it gave me respect for the gun and treating it with respect. 
[01:03:00]  About discipline and responsibility.  Right.  That, you know, people don't realize that.  They think, oh, you're brought up with guns.  You're going to go and shoot up a score.  Anthony Opa, I'll get you guys a copy.  I have a book that made the New York Times bestseller list called God, Guns, and Rock  and Roll.  I'll get you a copy of it.  And if people are interested in it, if they want the truth, I've done my homework.  I've been a sworn sheriff deputy since 1980.  Like Elvis?  Do you pull people over?  Elvis rock.  Exactly like Elvis. 
[01:03:30]  Exactly like Elvis.  I get a big belly.  This is the book here.  Oh, my God.  Where did you come up with that?  Wow, it just appeared.  That's cool.  But anyhow, I've done my research.  I take it seriously.  I know what my duties are here in America other than scaring people with my guitar.  I'm a good father and a good husband.  I'm a good member of my community.  I literally, on a daily basis, speak to elected officials to remind them that we, the people,  are their boss.  Ever thinking of running?  No.  I've talked extensively with a bunch of politicians who acknowledge that when I can get on your 
[01:04:00]  kind of show and when I can do radio and TV, that I cause, literally, the real power that  I have is causing people like Mike and Anthony and Chris to make me look good.  Because it makes, you know, so what I do is I make sure that people who don't vote and  that don't know the truth about guns and our Constitution get some education.  That's what I've done in my book, God, Guns, and Rock and Roll.  Right on.  Russ from New Jersey.  He's an attorney.  Russ.  How you doing?  Good.  Hello, Russ.  I want to say hi to Ted, and I want to congratulate you on your position on the Second Amendment. 
[01:04:30]  I agree with you 100%, and it's nice for once to hear somebody who's either in Hollywood  or a rock star that's not some liberal idiot spouting political correct...  Yeah, that was too good, but we ought to jump out of the last word.  But, Russ, I appreciate that.  Ultimately, you know, I'm just a stupid guitar player.  I never went to college.  I was too busy learning things.  And some of the things I've learned in 52 years, clean and sober, is that if we all aspire  to discovering and embracing the truth, we can improve a quality of life in this country 
[01:05:00]  that is so simple.  It's so simple to do.  It's stupid.  And when you hear the rantings and the ravings of people like Mike and Anthony and Chris,  it further buoys my spirit and my efforts and energy to stay on the True North Compass that  I'm on.  I serve on the Board of Directors with Mothers Against Drunk Driving.  And the National Rifle Association.  I'm serving my third term.  Again, I'm just a stupid guitar player.  I have the time of my life.  I'm a lucky, lucky son of a bitch to have the great musicians and the great team that 
[01:05:30]  I do.  And to get a chance to, you know, open my mouth on a radio show.  Because I know you want to have fun.  You've got to have ratings.  You do all that.  But I'd like to think that the reason my radio show in Detroit was the top rated in  its broadcast area, for someone to say that I don't need to hunt because there's  already some dead stuff available, is I suppose that same illogicality.  The logic could be I don't have to grow a garden because someone has already planted,  it's already got some canned stuff and I don't have to play guitar because I can listen  to somebody else's and I don't need to breed my wife because there's a couple of guys 
[01:06:00]  that would be willing to do it for me.  You know, that kind of illogic.  I guarantee you this.  I guarantee you that Mike and Anthony and Chris abuse alcohol or drugs.  I guarantee it.  You could hear it in the tone of their voice.  There's a savagery and an abandonment of life.  Is that Anthony me?  No, that would be the other guy.  Oh, you just described that guy.  But you abandoned logic with panache.  We've got to get you out of here.  All right, man.  I appreciate the opportunity. 
[01:06:30]  So you're playing Friday?  Yeah, I'm playing tomorrow in Long Beach at Jones Beach.  Long Island.  Wait, tomorrow's Jones Beach and then we're playing in Holmdale, New Jersey.  On Friday.  On Friday, yeah.  Okay, and also you've got a new CD out, right?  Full Bluntal Nugity.  Say it, Anthony.  Full Bluntal Nugity.  God, I love the sound of that.  And I wrote a new song last night called,  My Baby She Likes My Butter on Her Grits.  Nice.  Now, you guys don't share books.  I know you're close and intimate and all that, but I can't. 
[01:07:00]  Well, I'll have to get a second book.  Yeah.  Yeah, write that one.  You have a second.  Write that one to Anthony.  That's cool enough.  I'm going to make this to Anthony.  Very cool.

I want to thank Ted Nugent for stopping in.  I want to thank Amber from Survivor for stopping in.  Yeah.  She's on the cover of the latest issue of Stuff Magazine.  I mean, where's Steve from foundrymusic.com because we've got to turn all our listeners on to Amber's lovely, ample, heart-shaped ass. 
[01:10:00]  Amber's beautiful butt.  Yeah.  She should be proud of that.  Yeah.  She mooned Jeff from Survivor, I think, right?  That's what she said?  Yeah.  And somehow, this ended up on the Internet.  In this day and age, man, a split second of doing something could just last a lifetime.  Well, longer than a lifetime because the Internet's timeless, isn't it?  Now her ass is going to be there.  Now for our new listeners, they're going to start understanding us a little better. 
[01:10:30]  Yesterday, we brought them the genital wart thing from Sandy Cain that looked kind of like half an ear growing from her private area.  I had a nightmare about that last night.  Swear to God.  I had like a nightmare that I went into the bathroom and as I was ready to get ready to take a leak, all of a sudden there was a big thing there.  Swear to God.  And I woke up like, huh, huh. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, well, a lot of people got to see what we saw in the studio yesterday, right?  What is that, Rick?  Could you get that away from me?  What's a rock in front of me that looks like the genital wart?  Did you see the genital wart, Jim Norton?  I'm really not easy to gross out.  That is one of the most disgusting.  She should be shot.  With head.  Yeah, exactly.  She should just shoot it off with a bow.  Yeah, she was proud of the damn thing.  She was really proud of it.  So yesterday, we gave you that horrific sight.  Today, we're going to turn you on to Amber's lovely heart-shaped butt. 
[01:11:30]  Right, Steve from Foundry Music?  Absolutely.  Got the picture up right now.  And the link right on the homepage, very easy to find.  And I've got to say, within three, not even three minutes of putting it up, 150, 200 people had already seen it.  Good.  Great.  They're pretty eager.  Sharing, Opie.  Yeah, it's foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music dot com.  I've got to just say a very special happy birthday today.  It's already been a year since we last celebrated the birthday of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. 
[01:12:00]  They are now 15 years old.  It seems like just yesterday we were celebrating that the Olsen twins were 14.  That's legal in some states.  Now they're 15, we are merely three years, three short years away from a possible three-way with the lovely girls, the Olsen twins.  Although they are three years past their prime.  You are the most despicable human being on the face of the earth. 
[01:12:30]  I'm waiting for legal aid.  I mean, you see there's some of these videos now and the TV show.  They're starting to dress a little more independently and like young women.  They sang a song about you.  What?  Ants in my pants?  Ants in my pants.  And it's bigger than an elephant?  Yes.  Do we have an Olsen song to celebrate their 15th birthday?  For their 15th birthday, we should play the song they sung about you.  My little girl.  The good soul.  All right, here it is.  Here it is. 
[01:13:00]  Check this out.  Yeah.  These girls are dirty.  Just listen to me.  Oh, my.  Opie.  Well, they are.  Listen to the lyrics in their songs.  All right.  Olsen twins.  Those annoying little things.  That grab your attention.  Grab your attention.  By crawling into places.  I wouldn't want to mention.  I bet.  Vaginas.  Should be taught some manners.  Taught some manners.  Despite their height.  You're right.  You shouldn't take what is in theirs. 
[01:13:30]  And it's just a right to fight.  Get a second, we're in.  It's in the hole.  Crater's on the crack.  Crater's on the crack.  Bugs on my bologna.  Oh, my God.  Here comes a bumble.  Hootah.  Those little things.  Make your stomach crumble.  Make it one of a bumble.  Tips and tips.  Ha-ha.  Teas and the flowers.  Bugs in my sweet and sour.  Ants in my...  Ants in my pants.  They all be cool.  Bigger than an elephant.  Nice. 
[01:14:00]  See, there you have it.  Fifteen.  Deficit little things.  That's a filthy, filthy sore.  Ants in my pants.  From the Olsen Twins.  That would hold up in court.  Now, you saw the poster that we have in the office.  We have a Mary Kay and Ashley poster in the office.  And they're...  This was a year old already.  Yeah.  This poster.  I can only imagine how stunning they are starting to look.  They're ripening.  It's like seeing the green bananas that are left out on your counter.  And you go, they'll be ripe soon.  That'll be ripe. 
[01:14:30]  Someday.  I'll eat two bananas at a time.  So, yeah.  Happy birthday to the old...  Mary, Kate, and Ashley.  All right.  We have to check into our Wow Sticker Stop.  Oh, how's that going?  I know the fine folks of Philly listening to us today, they're nowhere near where Earl  is for this Wow Sticker Stop.  But trust me, it's still entertaining as hell, okay?  We are at Toyota of Hackensack, 278 River Street in Hackensack, New Jersey, giving out the  fine Wow Bumper Stickers.  We're going to have Wow Stickers for Philly in the very, very near future. 
[01:15:00]  And 2020 downtown, they're doing a piece on us.  They're in the studio right now.  They're like, oh, just act yourselves and make believe we're not here.  Yeah, okay.  I'm sweating from the lights in here.  I thought they had a setup.  It is a little warm.  I'm not used to having these on me.  Yeah, they have a camera crew down at the Wow Sticker Stop to interview some of our listeners  as well.  So, representing the show today is our own Black Earl.  Earl!  Hey, guys.  How about you?  What's up? 
[01:15:30]  Virgin!  Hello!  They're yelling virgin at him.  Virgin!  Virgin!  Virgin!  Virgin!  Virgin!  Virgin!  Virgin!  Virgin!  Virgin!  Virgin!  Virgin!  Virgin!  Virgin!  Virgin!  Virgin!  Virgin!  I don't know if you can hear me or not, but we're at Toronto Back in Tech.  We're heading on a lot of stickers.  The crew is here from 2020 downtown.  How's it going, Earl?  And just because of those great comments, you know, I have in my possession a pair of U2 tickets 
[01:16:00]  for Sunday.  Oh!  Oh, look at Joe.  And we're going to make people in it.  Okay, Earl, obviously a lot of people are showing up for the WOW stickers, okay?  Although last time...  I don't know why they're so...  Do you remember last time Earl was doing a sticker stop and it was at a car dealership  and we said, how many people are there, Earl?  He goes, I don't know, but there's a lot of cars in a car dealership.  All right, Earl.  You. 
[01:16:30]  What is 2020 downtown doing right now?  They're interviewing some of our fine listeners, talking about the show and what's going on.  All right, they have teeth, right?  The listeners they're interviewing, hopefully?  Oh, yeah, most of them do.  All right, good, good, good.  They're presentable.  Sounds like there's a lot of chicks there, Earl.  A lot of ladies show up.  Earl, any ladies show up to the WOW station stop?  I see one, two, three, three ladies.  Okay.  Wow.  And Melissa, is Melissa there today?  And Melissa's one of them.  She's right here. 
[01:17:00]  Right.  All right.  Okay, hold on.  Okay.  Did he count?  What's going on, Dad?  Hi, Melissa.  Hey!  How's it going down there?  It's going good.  These guys are all really calm.  I don't know what's wrong with them.  Oh, really?  Well, they know I'm not allowed to go, but they said that there's going to be some showing  up soon, so we're going to stick around.  And we've got t-shirts, and we do have YouTube tickets for you guys.  They're calm because they're lightheaded.  All the blood left their brains because they're looking at Melissa. 
[01:17:30]  Hey, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  There are actually some in this crowd right now, but they're really being behaved.  They're not doing you guys justice.  I don't know what's wrong with them.  Yeah.  Well, don't pump them up too much.  All right.  Put Earl back on for a second, Melissa.  All right.  I want to see if they interviewed Earl because Earl was freaking all day about this.  Earl.  Yes.  Did you get interviewed today?  I haven't gotten interviewed yet.  Uh-oh. 
[01:18:00]  Well, that's probably the real clincher, the most captivating moment when they actually speak  with Earl.  So, Earl, what do you do?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Earl, are you nervous they're going to interview you?  No, not at all.  Oh, you're such a liar.  I'm not lying.  You were freaking around here all day.  Yeah, I'm freaking out.  You know, my mom watches the show.  Hey, Earl, you should quit on TV.  Yeah.  He always quits when he goes to these sticker stops.  He has a hard time.  The people give him crap.  And he goes, well, if you want to do it next time, you come yourself. 
[01:18:30]  And quits.  And then the next sticker stop, he's there again.  All right, Earl.  Yeah, we'll be here until 5.30, and this crowd is surprisingly quiet.  I don't know why, but we're going to be having our wild tickets for a while.  And, again, we're going to figure out a creative way to give out these YouTube tickets.  It's your Sunday.  Okay, it's Toyota of Hackensack, 278 River Street, Hackensack, New Jersey,  with Earl and the lovely and talented Melissa.  Show up and be on TV.  Thanks, Earl.  All right, thanks, guys.  All right, there he goes, Earl.  It'll be a great way to give out the tickets if they handed out meat hooks 
[01:19:00]  and Earl hid the tickets in his rectum.  We can give that a try.  We introduced Philly to Whippin' Mount Wednesday today as well, Jim.  Yes, wow.  Put the wow in your car.  Any sightings?  Probably not.  Yeah, I think it's kind of early for Philadelphia,  but they don't know what they're in for.  It's going to be really cool.  Basically, we're telling the Philadelphia listeners to put wow in their car,  and we encourage the ladies, if they see the wow in the highways,  that they, you know, flash their fine assets. 
[01:19:30]  Right.  And, ladies, you don't have to do it, you know.  It's up to you.  There's plenty of ladies out there that will do it.  Okay?  Put it on your car, and you never know.  You just sit and wait, and before you know it, bam.  Right.  The girl next to you is showing you her goods.  Right.  Tiffany!  Yes?  You're calling from Philly?  Yeah.  What's going on?  Nothing much.  All right.  What do you want to do today?  I want to play What's in My Pants.  Ah.  You?  From Philly?  Mm-hmm.  I've only been listening for about four days,  but my boyfriend gets your show on his radio, 
[01:20:00]  and he told me all about it.  Oh, cool.  Where are you right now?  Washington Township.  It's like about 20 minutes from Philly.  Okay.  No, but I mean, are you in your room?  Are you at work?  Yeah, I'm in my room.  I already got my clothes off.  Wow, you're prepared.  We like that.  I wanted to do it yesterday, but I couldn't get through, so.  Well, we had that fatty that just got in the way yesterday.  You know, what do you look like, Tiffany?  I'm 5'6", about 120 pounds.  I got natural blonde, curly hair, blue eyes. 
[01:20:30]  Blue eyes, nice.  Yeah.  Nice rack?  It's all right.  What are you sporting, like B's?  Ah, C's, 30 AC.  Oh, 30 AC, nice.  Nice.  How old a gal are you?  19.  What?  19.  19.  19.  Guess what's in my pants.  Nice.  How about that?  You guys excited?  Yes, we're looking forward to this.  So, what kind of posters do you have in your room?  I got a bunch of Doors posters.  Doors?  Hippie chick? 
[01:21:00]  Kind of.  I got a little bit of everything.  I got like Alice in Chains.  I got Deftones, stuff like that.  Sounds like a goer, Hopi.  You don't get the hair under your arms, though, do you?  No, not at all.  Well, some of the girls are into that these days.  I beg the ladies to stay away from that little trend.  What's on your bed?  Um, satin sheets.  Satin sheets.  Burgundy.  You go.  I like that.  You got a goer here.  Well, my bed's one of them metal canopy beds that, you know, can be, like, tied to it  a hundred different ways. 
[01:21:30]  Have you ever been?  Yes.  Do you live alone?  No.  I live with my boyfriend.  Oh, you live with your boyfriend?  Mm-hmm.  I was thinking with your parents, that would make it even dirtier.  Well, I wouldn't care, anyway.  What's that noise?  I think the parents are the ones tying her up.  The ones tying her up?  Yeah.  They're very nice.  Yeah, I was hoping that.  Nah.  Let's get home.  Well, Tiffany, you know how we play the game, right?  Mm-hmm.  And you're naked already?  Uh, I still got underwear on.  Well, I think you should lose that.  Yeah, you got to take those off to play the game.  Well, I didn't know if you wanted to hear, like, you know, me taking them off or anything. 
[01:22:00]  No, that's okay.  You can just rip them off, whatever.  Okay.  We get the visual.  Could you yell, help, please don't do that?  You're an awful man.  All right, Tiffany?  I'm ready.  Here's how the game works.  Let me, uh, let everybody know how this works.  You will take the telephone.  As per our instructions, you will then rub it on your most intimate of region.  Uh, we will then guess by the sounds made from your rubbing what type of hairstyle you're sporting, uh, in that area.  Now, remember, do not tell us what kind of hairstyle you're sporting. 
[01:22:30]  Don't even give us a hint.  Don't say yes, no.  Remain silent until we ask you what's in your pants.  I must say the blondes are much tougher.  Tougher because it's a finer hair.  Yes.  Are we ready for the theme song?  Yes.  It's time to play.  Who's that?  It's time to play.  Who's that?  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  Who's that?  Who's that?  Who's that?  Who's that?  Who's that?  It's time to play.  Who's that?  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants? 
[01:23:00]  Who's that?  Who's that?  Who's that?  Those men, Monica, have sex with me.  All right, Tiffany.  Yes?  If you would take the phone and rub in an up and down fashion.  Listen.  Okay.  Here's where it gets deceiving, though.  That could mean a few things.  I'm going to guess a tornado.  It is a little...  Okay. 
[01:23:30]  Well, I'm not making any assumptions yet.  All right.  That was up and down.  Let's go with the side-to-side.  Side-to-side, which is the most telling of strokes.  Of course.  Listen closely, everybody.  All right.  All right.  Hearing a little...  You've got to turn that radio down in the background.  Yeah, Tiffany, please turn the radio down.  Can we do that again?  Yeah.  And we're on a longer way, so...  Oh, yeah.  I heard a little...  Did you hear something going on?  Sure did.  Okay.  Now, if you would...  A circular fashion. 
[01:24:00]  I got it.  I got it.  I need to hear the up and down one more time.  Up and down one more time?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  I'm changing my guess.  You're changing?  I've never changed.  Always go with the first instinct.  Remember the choices, people out there playing at home.  It's either the basic standard triangle, whether it's ungroomed or groomed, it's still just  the triangle, or the mohawk, which is shaved in on the sides, leaving the landing strip 
[01:24:30]  mohawk type thing, or the Hitler mustache, which is the mohawk, but it's been shaved down  from the top, so it looks like, well, Hitler's mustache.  And, of course, the ever-favorite wood floor, or as we like to call it here, the jambonet.  Hey, I'm changing, too.  See, you're all confused.  I'm saying it right now.  I'm guessing, don't tell us, Tiffany.  I'm guessing wood floor.  That's what I'm changing to.  Are you?  I'm going to say an ear-shaped growth.  No. 
[01:25:00]  Ah!  No.  I'm going wood floor.  Norton?  I'll go with a landing strip.  Landing strip, the mohawk.  Opie?  Yeah, I changed to a wood floor myself.  You changed back to a jambonet.  Rick?  I don't know.  I think I'm going to go with Hitler mustache.  Hitler mustache.  I heard a little something.  That's very hard to pick out, the Hitler mustache.  But, all right, all our guesses are in.  Tiffany, if you would please tell us, what is in your pants? 
[01:25:30]  The wood floor.  It is the wood floor.  See?  A lot of people very, very freaked out now, saying, how could that possibly be a wood floor?  He can have my boyfriend.  He'll tell you.  It sounded like the Fred Flintstone beard.  I was going to go with the Hitler mustache until I heard the up and down one more time.  Listen to the up and down.  That's your cue.  Do it again, Tiffany.  The up and down.  See, it's very consistent.  And the side-to-side very telling, too.  Right.  Try that one again. 
[01:26:00]  See?  I'm 0 for 50.  I can't do this thing of the day.  For people at home that are playing, when it sounds like it's Fidel Castro, it isn't.  It's the wood floor.  The more that's down there, the lighter it will sound.  When it sounds really rough, it means chiché.  When did you take care of that?  I do it every day or every other day.  So when was the last time you did it?  Last night.  Last night.  So you have a little stubble.  A little tiny stubble. 
[01:26:30]  That's probably what got Norton confused.  Adam on another line says, sounded like she shook a bag of gravel.  You mean?  I couldn't get this game right if a six-year-old called up and played.  Now, you know what?  You went too far.  All right, listen.  Just make a point.  Do we have something we could give Tiffany for playing What's in My Pants?  Of course.  Tiffany from Philadelphia.  19 years old.  Thank you for playing What's in My Pants.  It was a pleasure.  Our first ever Philly Guess What's in My Pants game. 
[01:27:00]  Yes.  And hold on the line for a prize, okay?  Okay, thanks.  All right.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  Vagina.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  Jane, what's going on?  Yeah.  Hey, Owen.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I'm heading south, or north, I'm sorry, at River Road in Hackensack, and I just passed 
[01:27:30]  the sticker stop.  Yeah.  And I just want to let everybody know that going north on River Road to get in the right  lane.  I was going to wow all the boys waiting in line for the sticker stop, but the truck was  to my right, so I couldn't wow them.  Oh, go back.  Well, everybody who wants to wow, get in the right lane, because there's a bunch of trucks  and buses on this road.  Oh, thanks for helping us out with that, Jane.  Wonderful.  Have a great day, guys.  All right.  Keep up the good work.  Bye-bye.  I guess ladies are driving by the sticker stop and wowing as they go by. 
[01:28:00]  Let's drive by wowings.  We don't discourage that.  That's the wow sticker stop at Toyota of Hackensack, 278 River Street.  We're going to be there for at least another half hour with Earl and the gang from 2020  downtown.  Mm-hmm.  Ty Croce from the 76ers is calling in in a few minutes here.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, he climbed the bridge today.  Climbed the bridge?  What did he do?  The guy's out of his effing mind.  We'll get into it next, because we have to take a break.  And Balloon Nacho has a couple observations, and then we'll break.  Joe.  Hey, guys.  Hey. 
[01:28:30]  Long time listener.  Yeah.  Got some post-syndication observations here.  Okay.  First off, Opie.  Yeah.  You are being nice to the callers.  You have been improving for months now, but you're really being nice to them.  We kind of miss the old cranky Opie.  Well, I was rude yesterday.  I called that girl fat and stuff when she didn't play What's in My Pants, right?  Yeah, that was fantastic.  And I threw up yesterday when Sandy Kane showed the growth.  That's true also, and that's part of my observations, too.  All right.  I didn't hold back or anything.  No, no.  I'm not knocking you here.  Okay.  Okay.  But, yeah, the ear thing, that was pretty disgusting, sort of, Fisher, last night. 
[01:29:00]  Mm-hmm.  Post-syndication, there are now giveaways and prizes.  Yes, there is.  Yeah.  And better guests, right?  The guests are getting better.  Nugent was on today, that gay guy with the play yesterday.  Yeah, Nugent rocks.  Post-syndication observation, Earl is finding and getting two sticker stops on time.  Well, he has to now.  We have a purpose.  Yeah.  And Pig Week, the rumor is that Pig Week, you guys have had pegs on all week.  Yes, we did.  It was Pig Week.  The rumor is that Pig Week continues tomorrow, and tomorrow will feature obese Girl Scouts 
[01:29:30]  shooting enemies for distance.  No, no, that's not true.  Who let you in on one of our show meetings?  Let me tell you something, Joe.  We just had a hot girl from Philadelphia, a teenager, play What's in My Pants.  Yeah.  We're improving a little bit.  And we have a girl outside the studio that's getting tar and feathered today for Backstreet Boys tickets.  Hey, look, I'm not asking you to improve.  In fact, I like it when you're in the gutter.  Okay, good.  All right.  But just some post-syndication observations.  Great shows.  All right.  And Philly, hi Philly, at W-Y-S-P. 
[01:30:00]  Take care, YouTube balloon nuts.  All right, bye.  Bye.  And we had the, yeah, the best-ass champion yesterday, Allison, looking real good in her lingerie.  She's going to be part of a new contest that we're going to break out in a few days.  I don't think that covered up for what he called pig week.  It really was pig week.  How nice is Allison behind you, though?  And it's only Wednesday.  It's only Wednesday.  It's still been pig week.  All right.  We're going to get better as the week goes.  All right.  Pig half a week.  We're going to get that girl in next to, you know, to get tar and feathered. 
[01:30:30]  You know, you're right.  It's only been Monday and Tuesday.  And already it feels like a pig week.  Just for the fact that we've had girls in here that we never, ever would have had on this program.  We couldn't have fit them.  All right.  High crochet up next.  That's going to be really, really cool.  But basically, Anthony, you asked the question, what did he do today?  He climbed the Walt Whitman Bridge this morning to raise a banner that read,  Go Sixers Beat L.A.  Well, that'll do it.  The banner was hung, ready for this, 397 feet above the water. 
[01:31:00]  The guy is insane.  How did he get up there?  He climbed.  He's not.  He's out of his mind.  That is crazy.  I love this guy.  I really do.  He doesn't have to do things like this.  No.  More money than God, and he does this type of thing.  Aren't the tickets sold out for the Sixers, though?  Yeah, but he's just getting the whole...  To get the spirit up.  Getting the city together.  He's an owner of the team.  Someone...  That's what I'm saying.  He doesn't have to promo it.  I mean, it's a thing.  Someone from Philly's got to call up and help us out,  because he did the same thing by climbing a building. 
[01:31:30]  Climbing a building?  Yeah, earlier in the playoffs.  Okay.  We'll get someone from Philadelphia to explain that to us as well.  Okay?  O.P.  Anthony.  107.  W.N.E.W.

I like Jaws.  877-692-1027 if you want to get a hold of the show.  That's a toll-free number.  Mom, season and tenderizing, down you go.  They're still filming, Anthony.  They're still filming.  Of course.  You'll see all this.  The 2020 Downtown have been filming us all day long for a piece they're going to do sometime  in July, I believe. 
[01:33:30]  It's fun.  And on the phone, Anthony, it's a pleasure to say hi to Pat Croce of the 76ers.  Pat!  Yo, O.P. and Anthony.  Welcome to Philadelphia, guys.  Thank you.  Oh, you don't know how much that means to me.  Why not?  I heard you the other day, or yesterday I was, about you wanted to get me on the show,  so I thought I'd surprise you.  Yeah, tell everyone how cool we are.  Come on, Pat.  Help us out.  You're right.  We need listeners down there in Philadelphia.  You'll get them.  You just stay the way you are, just chilling in the background, having fun.  Philly guys love fun. 
[01:34:00]  Cool.  Obviously.  Now, Pat, I'm a huge, huge basketball fan in general.  I heard that.  Huge.  I got to tell everyone I'm not going to lie here.  I'm a major Knicks fan, okay?  That's cool.  Hey, you're from New York.  That's cool.  You got to have pride in your own hometown team.  Well, with that said, I am rooting for the Sixers, and I hope they can kick the Lakers' ass.  You and me both.  Now, what the hell did you do this morning?  You had a really big day.  Well, I climbed the Walt Whitman Bridge right up the cable.  Yeah?  Right up the cable with a couple of Union riggers, and we hung this 5-by-70-foot sign on the side of the bridge 
[01:34:30]  as you enter from New Jersey, and it says, Go Sixers, beat L.A.  It was cool.  The banner was hung 397 feet up on the water.  Yeah, you know what?  And the only thing, and it was exciting, but it's not thrilling.  It would have been thrilling if they allowed me to rappel down into the Delaware River.  That's what I wanted to do.  You're insane.  Nah, that's nothing.  Todd, you don't have to.  I'm just having some fun.  You know what?  We're trying to juice up the spirit and continue to keep the spirit up high, even though we're down 2-1. 
[01:35:00]  You're a hell of a cheerleader.  Now, I mean, was it scary to climb like that today?  Nah.  I had a check rain on.  I had it on this cable, this little cable wire along the way.  So if I would have fell, that thing would have had me suspended.  Oh, wow.  I don't know.  I wouldn't have been able to do it.  You know what it reminded me of?  And I told my wife this, and she thinks I'm a little off.  When Tarzan, Johnny Welsmuller, I think he ran up the cable in the Brooklyn Bridge and Tarzan back to New York.  And I thought, yeah, I can do that.  And she goes, Pat, that was a movie.  I said, Diane, back then, they didn't have special effects. 
[01:35:30]  That's true.  If he can do it, I can do it.  Some guy really had to do it.  Yeah.  What are some of the other crazy things you've done for the Sixers?  I think it was during the first playoff series against Indiana.  I climbed this 265-foot water tower in this narrow ladder, straight up, vertically straight up.  As a matter of fact, guys, when you get to the top, the last 15 feet was kind of backward.  And then you got on top of the water tower, and we hung this Go Sixers banner.  The helicopters were buzzing me like I was King Kong on top of the Empire State Building.  I'm Jim Norton.  I'm on the show today.  How are you, sir? 
[01:36:00]  I'm great, Jim.  How are you?  I'm sorry to interfere with your show.  No, no, you're terrific.  I don't know who to talk to, but your brother has my wallet.  Oh, man.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  No, Jim, that's okay.  I can take ribs.  That's okay.  But when I see you, I'm going to kick your ass.  Yeah, he will kick your ass, too, Jim.  What's the story with your brother in the wallet?  I guess he just had sticky fingers.  Really?  Is that really a true story?  He lifted Iverson's wallet?  No, he took some cash out of his pocket. 
[01:36:30]  That's a little joke.  No, that's a true story, and it's something that hurts the family and hurts the franchise.  It's not something I really like to kid about.  All right.  But we had to get it out there.  That's okay.  I came on the show.  I guess I could get whacked.  No, that's okay.  You know, we're all about just being honest here.  We got that out of the way.  Hey, we all have brothers.  Yes.  We all know how they can be.  You should meet some of mine.  Mine can't write a song parody without using the Patty Duke theme.  How embarrassing is that?  So how are you feeling for tonight's game, Pat? 
[01:37:00]  I feel great.  We got them right where we want them.  Us down 2-1.  Now, you know what?  We were down 1-0 in Indiana.  We were down 2-1 in Toronto.  We were down 2-1 in Milwaukee.  Tonight's the night.  I mean, this is where our team's got to win.  If we want to be champions, we've got to win these games.  Right.  Did you help them with their foul shooting today?  No, I don't do anything on that court.  No, I know you don't.  I do have to.  You know what?  I could tape an ankle, though, if they need that.  And we've got a lot of broken ankles on this team.  Right.  Right on.  And how are you doing from the motorcycle action? 
[01:37:30]  Oh, I'm cool.  As a matter of fact, you know, climbing the ladder, climbing the cable up to Walt Whitman Bridge.  My leg doesn't bother me at all.  I'm just starting to resume running again.  No, it doesn't look pretty, but it works.  And that's the key.  Five surgeries later.  Did I see footage of you also bungeeing down from the arena there?  I rappelled down.  I rappelled down, upside down from the height of the, I guess, the rafters in the arena.  But that was a couple years ago.  That was when we first made the playoffs in 1999.  For the first time, there was an eight-year drought we made the playoffs. 
[01:38:00]  So I wanted to get the fans all juiced up and get them excited about the playoffs, and it was pretty cool.  Was that before or after?  Owen Hart did the same thing, only a lot quicker.  It was one week before.  One week before.  One week before.  Wow.  And since that time now, the NBA prevents all rappelling.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  In the arena, yeah.  Now, do you have something up your sleeve if the Sixers win this whole thing?  Opie and Anthony, wait.  You've got to cheer us on because you're going to want to see us win it to see what we pull off after we win it. 
[01:38:30]  You can only imagine.  You're a lunatic.  Oh, man, you know what?  That's it.  Celebrate the day.  Look for reasons to celebrate.  It's every win we really go off.  But if you can win the world championship in the NBA and beat the Lakers, that's a reason to party for a week straight.  Look at what Pat Croce does for the Sixers.  Steinbrenner can't even climb out of his own limo.  Yeah, but that's because he's weighed down with all those rings. 
[01:39:00]  He sure is.  Man, I would love just one of them.  Yeah.  I'm a Mets fan, so I'm not really happy that they've won all those World Series lately.  So, Anthony, a big Yankees fan.  Yeah.  Or Yankees fan.  Hell of a team.  Yeah, well, they got ripped off last night.  Rob.  That was a foul ball.  Foul ball.  That made me laugh really hard.  Last night, the Yankees got ripped off.  Jesus Christ.  Don't get me started.  All right, Pat.  I know you're a busy man. 
[01:39:30]  We'll let you go.  Well, I hope you, Anthony.  Again, welcome to Philadelphia.  Keep having fun.  Keep putting smiles on people's faces.  And do me a favor.  Throw a sidekick in Jim's gut.  Hey, thanks a lot, Anthony.  Good luck to you.  All right, thank you.  Pat Croce from the Sixers.  Jim here.  Hello.  Hi.  It's me, Jim Norton.  I have something to say.  I have a monkey wrench to throw in this interview.  We're trying to make friends in Philly, Jim.  We don't hit him with that stuff until later on. 
[01:40:00]  Sorry.  Wow, right off the bat.  Man.  It was almost the first thing.  When he said hello, I almost spit it out.  Yeah, maybe three words can come out.  A couple of questions.  He was a very nice guy, though.  He was great.  All right, Jim, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I was going to give you all the information about Croce, but apparently you guys knew that already.  I know a lot about the guy.  I wasn't going to bring up the brother incident.  Yeah, I'm like Norton over there.  Isn't that a bad...  Well, you know, history's had their embarrassing brothers and stuff.  Billy Carter and whatnot.  George Klan.  George Klan. 
[01:40:30]  I mean, all that stuff.  It's just...  It's something you've got to live with.  Brother...  Jim, how does that story go?  Which one?  About the brother.  Over the weeks, there have been...  During the season, they...  People have been missing stuff out of their locker room.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  So, they set up a surveillance camera.  Oh, no way.  Because all the players were thinking that it was maybe, you know, Croce's brother, like  George Lynch was saying.  Uh-huh.  So, they set up the camera in the locker room. 
[01:41:00]  While they're all practicing, he comes in and starts looking through Iverson's stuff.  Of all the people's pockets, he gets caught on Allen Iverson's stuff.  Oh, Jesus.  And then, Billy King, who's the GM of the Sixers, called up Croce and said, look, we got this  on tape.  He wasn't putting his face in their shorts or anything, was he?  I think he was sniffing a couple pairs.  Oh, imagine that.  He put a hidden camera to see that. 
[01:41:30]  Smelling jock straps.  Smelling jock straps, putting Iverson's sock on his mule, whacking his badge.  Yeah, I'm so glad you brought that up today, Norton, to Ty Croce.  He was a great guy, though.  I mean, he took it in stride.  Got some balls, though, Norton.  He got some balls.  All right, Jim.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  All right.  See you.  Things you got to deal with.  You're in the public eye like that, but you wouldn't imagine that the brother would  be...  Gary, what's going on?  Gary.  We lose Gary?  Okay.  Yep.  Oh, he was right there.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hello? 
[01:42:00]  Give him another shot.  Gary.  Yeah, what's up?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, I'm calling from Roars for it, man.  You guys are awesome.  Hey, thank you.  Hey, I just wanted to say, well, we got the Babe Fest going on in Philly.  I know.  I want to see some hardwood floors out there.  Well, I think we're going to the Babe Fest this year.  Oh, you are?  That's what?  You guys better be there.  A week from tomorrow, right?  Yeah, 21st, I think it is.  I think right after the show, we're taking the train down to Philly.  I'm telling you, man, there's a lot of fine ladies around here.  Cool.  Yeah, we're going to be hanging with Kid Rock and Slash's Snake Pit is performing? 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, I'm trying to get tickets.  I'm going to call Howard starting tomorrow and see what's up with him.  All right.  Yeah, I just want to give everybody at Roars for it a shout-out, man.  Cool, man.  To all these ladies with the hardwood floors who come to King of Prussia, go to the mall.  Seriously, we got some WOW stickers going on out there.  Yeah, make sure you get WOW in your car, Gary.  The Whip-Em-Out Wednesday thing is going to be huge in Philadelphia.  That is a guarantee.  Hey, we can be acting awesome, but you just can't say the word.  All right, thanks, Gary.  All right, no problem.  All right.  Is this true? 
[01:43:00]  I'm getting a news report.  Frank Torrey was just caught crapping in Jeter's hat in the Yankees' locker room.  Is that true?  It's so funny.  I can't believe it.  They didn't know who it was, but they found a heart in one of the lockers.  Oh, my God.  You just go too far.  See, Philly, we abuse our own as well.  Don't take it personally.  Horrible, horrible little man, Jim Norton.  Earl's checking in for the WOW sticker stop. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, I feel the excitement with Earl.  Earl.  What's up, guys?  We're at Toyota and Hackensack.  Come here.  And that WOW sticker is more so funny.  Come here, baby, WOW!  And everyone lined up along River Street.  They're holding a WOW sign, trying to get girls to WOW.  Girls wowing?  I'm sorry?  Or girls wowing, Earl?  Girls are generally giving looks of horror, but we haven't gotten a WOW yet. 
[01:44:00]  Horror, wows, whatever.  Were you interviewed for 2020 Downtown?  No, I was not.  Oh, look at their avoiding her, Earl.  They're heading back to the studio to get more footage of you guys.  Good.  See, they can detect that whole entertainment kryptonite that is Earl.  You know?  It's like the entertainment just goes out of you like Superman in that pool with the kryptonite  around his neck.  Either that or they didn't want people to adjust their sets when the piece was on set.  Oh, Jesus, man, you know...  Ring the bell. 
[01:44:30]  I'm ringing it, Earl.  I'm ringing it, Earl.  All right, Earl.  Thanks.  And we have yet to give away tickets to the sold-out U2 show.  We're trying to do, like, stupid human traits.  Oh, great.  The leading guy right now is a guy...  Jim, shut up.  Shut up, Jim.  Earl, wait a minute.  Shut up, Earl.  You said they didn't interview you?  No.  Because I have a clip that is supposed to be you on the next 2020 Downtown that we're on.  Hey, where are the white women at?  Oh, we're all...  Did you have to say that? 
[01:45:00]  No.  Did you hear that?  No.  I didn't hear it.  No.  The Warriors did it.  No.  Oh, they did ask you your name, though.  I'm Big Dick Blatt.  Oh, Jesus.  What?  Do we have to?  All right, Earl.  We're going to let you go.  You're leaving there in, what, 10 minutes?  Yeah, we're leaving in a few minutes.  So far, the leading candidate to win these U2 tickets, he climbed the roof and mooned the crowd, 
[01:45:30]  and they had a wow sticker on his butt crack.  That sure isn't what Whip Them Out Wednesday is all about.  I know.  All right.  It was an act of total horror, but...  Look at Earl hanging out with naked guys.  We're still here.  We're all here.  And we'll be here for a few more minutes, so if you want to win these tickets, come on down.  And if you just want to get a wow sticker, come on down.  All right, Earl.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Great job, as always.  There's Earl.  I can't wait to send Earl to Philly.  Earl's just fantastic.  You know what I feel like after I listen to Earl? 
[01:46:00]  It's like watching one of the best Seinfeld episodes ever.  You just have that feeling you've been entertained.  Jay has something.  Jay, what's going on?  Hey, not much, man.  I just got back from the sticker stop.  Earl's definitely gay.  I'm sorry.  But, hey, after that comment, man, I was trying to get tickets for the Moore show tonight with Norton.  I was thinking about Friday.  Did they say, Norton's going to be there?  I'm definitely going now, man.  Yeah.  You're awesome, Norton.  Thanks, buddy. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Dude, great.  This is the dry dock guy, too, by the way.  Oh, cool.  What's up, Jay?  Beautiful.  Later, guys.  All right.  Yeah, Jim Norton's playing with Jay Moore tonight at Rascals in West Orange.  Yeah, I'm there by myself on Friday.  All right.  And let me give one quick credit to confuse you.  People call him Rascals, Sal.  You were right, Opie, you can only plug one thing at a time.  Oh, Jay.  You were right.  I stand corrected.  I am in Rascals Ocean alone Sunday.  Jay's not there.  I don't know where he is, who he's seeing, what he's seeing.  Jay's just playing tonight.  Only tonight.  At Rascals in West Orange.  I'm going.  Tonight.  After the show.  What are you going for?  Oh, without a doubt.  To see you.  Only tonight in West Orange is Jay Moore. 
[01:47:00]  Jay Moore and Jim Norton.  Yes.  Can we take a break?  Yes.  Is the Tarn Feather Girl here, Rick?  Oh, yeah.  She's outside waiting.  What's her name again?  Her name is Lola.  Lola.  We'll get Lola into this mess next.  We're going to tar and feather her.  What do we got?  Honey and what?  Honey and Feathers.  And Feathers.  And what is she going to win?  Backstreet Boys.  Backstreet Boys.  What the hell are we doing with that?  And Ben's pointing, like, make sure you promote the show.  No, I can care less where the Backstreet Boys are playing. 
[01:47:30]  Where are they playing?  I don't even want to say.  And people are going to think we care.  Thank you.  What?  What?  What?  We were watching that NSYNC video.  What?  We were a bunch of fags today watching that NSYNC video.  Oh, because we were picking out the guy that wasn't in NSYNC that was in the video.  One of the guys, the big fat guy.  Yeah.  Joe Pastrami.  What's his name?  Yeah, whatever.  The big fat guy?  The fat old guy?  Broke his knee or something?  From the Backstreet Boys?  He broke his leg, so they put in a stand-in. 
[01:48:00]  Like, they could just drop anyone.  They painted a beard on him and threw him in the background in the dance sequences.  Big whoop.  Okay.  What's Stinky?  We know it's NSYNC.  Oh, I thought you said Backstreet.  Oh, that's what I thought.  See?  I can't keep track of these guys.  I'm talking about the guy that broke his leg.  Stinky's absolutely right.  I thought it was Backstreet Boys.  What do I know?  Andy.  What do I know?  I have a penis.  Hello?  Andy.  What up?  Hey.  You're on the radio, Andy.  Oh, hi. 
[01:48:30]  How's it going?  Hey.  Dude, I just looked at that picture of Amber.  Oh, my God.  She's so hot.  Which one?  The one of her mooning?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's on foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  And she's on the cover of the latest issue of Stuff.  See, I've only seen the little faxed piece that we got on that.  Is it in color and everything?  Yeah, it's in color.  It's kind of small, though.  Yeah, it is.  Well, that's how we got it.  She has a nice dumper, doesn't she?  Oh, definitely.  That's a four-knuckler, as far as I'm concerned.  You're a hopeless romantic.  All right.  Thanks, Andy.  All right.  Peace out, man. 
[01:49:00]  You guys suck.  Peace out.  It's the first day of Whip Him Out Wednesday in Philadelphia.  Yes.  It'll take off.  Here's a song that describes it a little bit.

[02:01:00]  That's exactly what I was thinking  When they tell  The only time you even know  About tar and feather  In this day and age  Is through cartoons  Remember that  Like Bugs Bunny  Who dumps them on Yosemite Sam  Oh  And he'd freak out  And then he'd have to  Rip it off of him  That's all I know  So I don't know  What it's like for a human  Since we can't  Cover you with boiling hot tar  We're going to use honey  We're going to use honey  Now I have a problem with this  Because I hate sticky  Sticky is one of my pet peeves  I get like  A sticky thing 
[02:01:30]  And a little  You know what though  The arm or something freaks me out  Norton loves sticky  I really don't  I'm the same as him  See yeah  If it's under my shoes  I know two boys getting big hugs  When I'm done  Sticky sucks  And I will run from sticky  I don't like it  Like you sit in a chair  And there's a  Like backyard barbecue  And there's some kid  With watermelon all over them  And they sit in the seat  And then you sit down  In your shorts  You get up  And as you walk  You feel behind your knee  Like sticky  I gotta run for a shower  I'm crazy like that 
[02:02:00]  Debra  Hey guys  Hey  How are ya  Good  We're getting ready  To tar and feather Lola  With some honey and feathers  I like sticky  You like sticky  Sticky's good  Okay  Nothing wrong with sticky  Slippery good  Sticky suck  No  Sticky's good  Sticky good  Sticky's good  What seems to be your dilemma  I was hoping to be sticky  Tonight at the Jay Moore show  But unfortunately  My daughter came down  With scarlet fever  And I'm stuck with two tickets  Scarlet fever  Who gets scarlet fever  What is this  What is this  1803 
[02:02:30]  Who gets scarlet fever  Scarlet fever  Did you call Doc Baker  He's at the Ingalls house  But I think he can make it over  How long has your daughter  Been a merchant marine  As long as she don't  Got the rickets  Who gets scarlet fever  Nope  My daughter gets scarlet fever  The one  You know  When you get married  The sex life starts to go  I'm hoping Jay Moore  Will just get things  Juicin' up  Wait wait  Yeah he'll bang you  What  He'll give you worse  Than scarlet fever  What  What happens  To a child 
[02:03:00]  Didn't Helen Keller  Get scarlet fever  I have no idea  As far as I know  I think Helen Keller  Was a little taut  She got the scarlet fever  Because they always call it  The whatever  They got the scarlet fever  And went deaf  Dumb  And that was it  Deaf and blind  And it was over  Well now they call it  The strep throat  With scarlet fever  Scarlet fever  Scarlet fever  Who gets that  The scarlet fever  Put her in the wagon  Wow  They can cure that  Nowadays though 
[02:03:30]  Alright  I never heard of  Anybody getting it  I never did myself  So  Very surprising  But  Here we have  These two tickets  I was ready  To go with my husband  Tonight  And have a good time  And now I can't go  So if any of your  Wonderful listeners  Would like these two tickets  I want them  Lola needs tickets  For tonight's show  Lola can have these tickets  How are we going to do this  Rick  We'll figure something out  Right  No freaking idea  Alright we'll put you on hold  We'll figure it out  Because Lola wants to go  For the show tonight  Okay Lola  We'll put her on stage  Tonight  Unfortunately 
[02:04:00]  Because of the scarlet fever  I have to have them  But I really appreciate  That your daughter  Has scarlet fever  No problem  Is she going to be alright  Yeah she is  She's going to be fine  Thank God  Thank God  Thank God  Yeah she's a nice lady  To call up and give her a ticket  She's very thoughtful  I would really like to go though  And it's unfortunate I can't  Maybe another time  I'm sure he'll be around again  Alright  Quick run  Fire in the barn  Thank you Debra  You're welcome  Okay  Almighty  We're minutes away from  Lola's tar and feathering 
[02:04:30]  Where's the  Where do the feathers stink  We sent Stinky out for some pillows  Where am I going to get feathers  You better not have gotten  Foam rubber pillows  Oh my God  Wow  I sure hope they're feathers  Joe these are real things  I had them cut them  Cut them open before  Yeah  Let's see some of the feathers  It's going to be a mess in here  It is really going to be a mess in here  That's why we have interns though  How are we going to  How are we going to put the honey on  You got massive amounts of honey  We got like 
[02:05:00]  Two big jars  What is that thing  Like a brush  That plastic spatula  Not a spatula  That you use to put  On the cake icing on  Yeah  When you're like making cookies  When you're stirring a marinade  I like basting young women in honey  Oh wow  That is down  Wow  Nice  Oh this is going to be really bad  I'm going to be hacking up hair balls  Well if we're going to get you to the Jay Moore show  You're going to have to  We're going to have to get honey  All over your body 
[02:05:30]  Not just the bikini part  Right  Right everyone  I do have to drive in my car though  After here  Yeesh  Well we have a bathroom  That's been used for  For sex  Oh no I mean for  Well yeah  But we have another bathroom  For washing and stuff  And I think there's ample soap and water  And Norton will help you clean those hard to reach spots  Like you did on Kimmy  I'm more than happy to do that  His head's like a scrub brush  Look at it  I'm a good guy like that  Oh look there's a little honey under the hood 
[02:06:00]  I'm going to pollinate her  You're going to get your head stuck  Look I got my hand caught in the honey pot  Tigger could you help me here  I've never seen honey come out of that before  That's white  That's not honey  Oh sorry  All right  We're going to do that next Anthony  Piglet  Watch me lick the honey pot  Hey Lola's enjoying that 
[02:06:30]  Good  Nice  Great  We'll get along  All right  Yesterday  Something we forgot to touch on  The Cardinal here in New York  Yeah  Had to give a seminar to the priest  To tell him that it's really really bad  To have sex with boys  With young boys  Yeah  It was on the front page of the post yesterday  He felt it necessary to get them all together  And tell them  That this is a bad thing  That it's really really wrong  Wow  Is this something that maybe might go without saying  Yeah but you know  It's such an epidemic  I mean there's a story in the paper 
[02:07:00]  Almost every day at this point  Yeah  That you know  A priest is doing something wrong  That he got his little priest flock together  To tell him how wrong it is  Fellas I know how tempting it is  But it has to stop  As far as I'm concerned  Alter boys are asking for it  If you're that much of a goody two-shoes  You deserve one  You know  I like a clamshell and a cocktail frank  Just as well as the next guy  Isn't that amazing  That he has to  Actually get them together  To tell him it's wrong 
[02:07:30]  You know  I get all hot  By a scrote  That looks like a plucked chicken too  But  You know  We got  We got to hold off  Guys  They're on to us  He felt it necessary  To call everyone together  It's not a very popular opinion  But  You get a guy that totally  Writes off sex  Goes into a job  Where the prerequisite is  You're never to have sex  Ever again in your life  There's something going on  There's some issues  I know  It would be nice to think  They get this  Divine calling 
[02:08:00]  But I think it's just  Some way to deal with  Maybe a sexual lifestyle  You don't want to  You don't want to fess up to  But leave the kids alone  Bang each other  That rectory should be like  A gay bar  Or the nuns  Bang a nun  Why not  They did the same thing  And that's because  They don't want to be with women  That's the whole thing  And the women nuns  They don't want to be with men  So they should just  You know  Those  Where they practice confessionals  Drill a hole  Make it a glory hole  Like  Down there 
[02:08:30]  In some of those bars  In the village  They would have a pisser  Just make it a big gay bar  The rectory  It's called a rectory  It sounds like  Bunghole  You shouldn't have to tell him  To touch  Not touch kids  Yeah we know  Stephen Lynch's parents  Were a priest and a nun  Yeah  Isn't that amazing  Were they really  Yeah  You didn't hear that story  Ever  His father was excommunicated  He was a priest  They both were  Yeah  Priest and a nun  Wow  Story of forbidden love  No wonder he's got 
[02:09:00]  Those twisted songs  In his head  Priest  Nun  Fall in love  Church wasn't going to accept it  And they ended up getting married  And having Stephen Lynch  Father  It's an amazing story  Father  Father  Do you think  The Pope could get my girlfriend  An abortion  Father  Father  Special dispensation  Yeah that's it  No I don't think  Okay thank you  Thank you  Thank you father  Come on  Saturday Night Fever  Give it to me  Jesus Christ  Give me the props  But Stephen Lynch  Has a little song about that 
[02:09:30]  Yes he does  About the priests  You got her pregnant  Yes I did  Yes I did  Yes I did  And this song's okay  Because Stephen Lynch's parents  Are a priest and a nun  Oh wow  We haven't played this in a while  A really long time  And when we come back  Many years ago  When I was going through  Some troubled times  I went to him for some advice  Some love advice  And sure he helps it  He helped me out a great deal  You're not a person  Great  Jesus  Oh man  That's how bad  Deep in prayer 
[02:10:00]  For my cross to bear  I kneel upon the floor  Temptations of a Catholic priest  Are easy to ignore  But I cannot control myself  It rips my soul apart  For one small sheep  Among my flock  Has stolen a shepherd's heart  Altar boy 
[02:10:30]  Altar boy  Confess your sins to me  You will find the grace of God  Inside my rectory  At Sunday mass or Bible class  I catch him in my view  So I close my eyes  But there he lies 
[02:11:00]  Spread eagled on the pew  And when I see him in that frock  My conscience goes awry  I'll give him some communion wine  That's spiked with Spanish fly  Altar boy  Altar boy  Is it gonna be heaven or hell  You can play my organ all night long  If you promise never to tell 
[02:11:30]  Oh, sheesh  Oh, sheesh  Oh, oh, oh  Oh, oh  Oh, Father  What's never?  Hallelujah be thy name  I could dress him up like the Pope  And then I  Oh, dear God, the shame  No, no, lead us not into temptation  Deliver us from sin  We could pretend that he was Jesus Christ and I was Mary Magdalene 
[02:12:00]  Altar boy, altar boy, confess your sins to me  You will find the grace of God inside my rectory  Oh altar boy, oh altar boy, confess your sins to me  You will find the grace of God inside my rectory

[02:15:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show  Jim Norton in the house  Lola  Getting ready to get tar and feathered, Anthony  For Backstreet Boys tickets  I just, I'm embarrassed that it's for Backstreet Boys tickets  Well, we should explain how this developed  We were playing a game called Mommy, What Would You Do for NSYNC tickets  Yeah, the only reason we would be giving away NSYNC or Backstreet Boys or any boy band tickets 
[02:16:00]  Is we somehow came across them  And then we got a unique little angle on it  Well, we found out that the mommies would do some crazy things to, you know, send their kids to see NSYNC or the Backstreet Boys  Yeah, because at that age where the girls are, where they start liking those bands  Is the same age they get a little rebellious against their parents  And maybe their mommy isn't feeling the love they felt from the kid for a couple of years  And this is a great way to buy the love of your children 
[02:16:30]  Let's not forget the lady, let's not forget the mommy that came down here  And had a bottle rocket shot out of her, uh, her peach  Right, for NSYNC tickets  For NSYNC tickets, a bottle rocket put in there, it was, uh  For the, right around the 4th of July  Right, shot right down the hall  Yeah  Fabulous moment for America  So we were in the middle of playing, Mommy, What Would You Do for NSYNC tickets  And then our contracts ran out and we had to leave the airwaves for a while  Right, can't work without a net 
[02:17:00]  So, uh, Lola is like the, she was, she was kind of left, one of the leftovers from that contest  Right?  But I'm not a mommy, I'm a sister  Hey, we don't care  It doesn't matter anymore  All we know is we get to see you naked and you get Backstreet Boys tickets  And, uh, we have the fun of a tar and feathering  Like I said, you only usually see that on, uh, cartoons  Yes  Well, now we can see it in real life  And this will break our pig streak  Yeah  Because Lola is very lovely  What?  We've had nothing but pigs in here 
[02:17:30]  It has truly been pig week  We're embarrassed that we, uh, have been presenting this crap to Philadelphia this week  Pig streak  We're, we're back to, you know, nice looking babes  Monday was elephants wrestling for a peanut  And, uh, yesterday, of course, was genital herpy wart day  I mean, let's give them something they can appreciate  Let's not forget the stalker Patty mess  And, uh, and retarded Laverne and Shirley  That came in  With the bad perm job  I got my perm, I got my hip perm 
[02:18:00]  Oh, she's awful  I look beautiful  I got my hip perm  Yeah, I got sort of a kind of brain  It looks like a football helmet without the face mask  I met them all the last day you guys were on  Before you were off the air  Because they were in the green room with me  Yeah, blithering idiots, right?  I was very disturbed by the good eye of  I don't know if it's Laverne or Shirley  But it was quite disturbing  The good eye  That's great  And then I had to take an elevator with  Talk about it  Yeah, they have one good eye between them  That's a very good observation from Lola 
[02:18:30]  You just smack them in the back of the head  With a spade shovel  Straighten that eye out  The best line about, uh, Marion's, uh, new perm  You look like a Dr. Seuss character  Yeah  I think that was Rich Voss, right?  She did  That's funny  All right, I think we're ready  Are we ready to tar and feather you?  Yes  I do  Okay, I guess we, uh, we need to clear a little area  You gotta stand over where the, uh  My plastic bag  The tarp is  Or whatever the hell that is  To catch any debris  And, um, of course 
[02:19:00]  The most important portion of this  The removal of the clothing  Yeah, so whenever you're ready  The part we like the most  We're waiting  2020 downtown filming this  Great  Mm-hmm  Uh, we're gonna hook up this mic  We gotta move over  Oh, yeah  I gotta move  What's, what's the matter, Rick?  What?  My shoes are terrible  Oh, man  The feet stink  Did you, do you stink?  My feet stink  You know  We wanted to stop Pig Week  Get a mic on her 
[02:19:30]  Rick, you really know how to make a girl feel at home  You're just a classic, dude  Rick just goes  He comes up and goes  Oh, Jesus Christ  Like it was horrific  The smell  What happened to you?  You got the bad feet?  No, I went through a puddle  On my feet  And so they stink  Oh, is it like a swampy thing?  I think  Or a foot thing?  I went through a puddle  On my feet  Mike's still not, uh  What'd you step in?  Stalker Patty's box?  All right  The mic is now on, Anthony  Okay, so  Now your feet smell  For some reason  My shoes smell  And he removed them  And ran across the room 
[02:20:00]  Let me  Stinky, you gotta take one for the team  Smell her feet  No!  My feet don't smell that bad  I'll smell the feet  I'll smell her sneakers  It's my shoes  All right  Stinky, wait  Give me one  And you get one  I'll  No, I don't want you  To smell my shoes  Which one?  Haven't you ever  Gone through a puddle  And you're  It's really not that bad  All right  Well, Rick freaked out  Is Rick a little overdramatic?  Yeah  All right, good  Then it's not pig week anymore  No, I was hoping  No, it's not at all  No stenches  Is that mic on?  Yeah  Oh, okay 
[02:20:30]  All right  She's getting naked, Anthony  Look at that  Norton  Nice, right?  Very nice  Very sexy  Black bra  Lola has blonde hair  Are we taking pictures for the website?  We have to share with the listeners  Hello  Norton like?  Oh, I'm good, right?  Very nice  Yes, yes  What do you got on?  Wow bikini  I forgot to wear underwear  I'm wearing a little  Oh my God  She just like stuck it to herself  That's not going to hurt coming off  That's good  It's a little uncomfortable  I hope you waxed before you put that on 
[02:21:00]  Oh, I took care of it  Yeah  No hair  Yeah, we're covering up the peach  So 2020 Downtown can show us  Oh yeah, because they're going to show bare breasts  On ABC television  Great, I'll be right  Lola  Thank you  Yeah, pig week is officially over  I'm glad to break the streak  Yeah, very nice  Alright, so yeah  You're just standing there completely naked  Yeah, because there's no honey  Now is the honey warmed up enough  Where it's going to flow nice?  Yeah, it's pretty good  Because we need it to flow over her body  We'll pour it right out  Okay, good  Pour it into her hands 
[02:21:30]  Now you might want to take  Brush, we're going to be applying it  With an aluminum baseball bat  No  Norton, you are the most heinous individual  Can we see your hiney?  I'm not trying to be dirty  Yes, you are  Wow, she covered the crack with a lounge sticker  That's so great  I tried to make it most, you know  Why are you covering the bikini?
