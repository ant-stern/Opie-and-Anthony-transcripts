<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly off-course.  The show began with a focus on Ricky, a staff member whose inefficient food-ordering methods (paying for each item individually) were heavily criticized by Travis, who called in to report on Ricky’s ineptitude. This led to a discussion of the unpaid internships of Travis, Danny, and Nathaniel, and the difficulties in securing paid positions at XM Satellite Radio. Ricky later returned to the studio to receive efficiency advice from the hosts.

Concurrent with the Ricky saga,  the hosts engaged with numerous listener calls. Harry called to report Lex and Terry's criticisms of the show, prompting speculation about their jealousy and Howard Stern’s influence in the radio landscape given his upcoming satellite radio move. Other calls covered diverse subjects: Opie's cold sores, West Coast replay scheduling complaints, the hosts' use of baby wipes, a colleague's manure mishap, and detailed accounts of the hosts’ respective neighborly interactions and a listener’s ex-girlfriend's strange behavior (including a cell phone antenna incident).  The recurring chant of "Vote for Pedro" punctuated the show.  Technical difficulties, causing audio dropouts in the Northeast, were also acknowledged.

The show's rambling nature continued into a segment discussing Dr. Pepper, its namesake, and actor David Norton, leading into anecdotes about a mentally challenged former Viacom employee, Eddie, and racially insensitive comments about a coworker's paycheck.  A failed attempt to connect with another radio station was followed by discussions about radio bits, production value, listener opinions on the Freedom Tower, and notorious Long Island crimes. This segment delved into graphic details of the Katie Beers and Colleen Stan kidnappings, the crimes of Jeffrey Dahmer, and various other local and national crimes, including the John List murders and the Kendall Francois case. A listener falsely claimed to live in one of the hosts' houses.  A potential Opie and Anthony road trip was also briefly mentioned, all punctuated by ongoing technical issues affecting a game played with a caller named Sharsi.

A disturbing segment then followed, beginning with a discussion about disposing of a body, referencing the woodchipper murder case.  A listener near the crime scene called in with further details.  This abruptly shifted to promotion of "America's Funniest Mom" on Lifetime, interrupted by the surprise arrival of George Foreman in the studio.  While excited, the hosts also played audio of Neil Diamond and Al Roker.  The majority of this segment involved commentary on "America's Funniest Mom" clips, interspersed with attempts to interview Foreman (during an XM Kids promotional event) and further discussion of the woodchipper murder case.  A prank call about a daughter in the porn industry and the story of a dethroned Miss Wheelchair America were also included.

The show later transitioned to a critique of the education system, sarcastically suggesting "Bukkake 101" as a relevant course.  This segment featured calls from "America's Funniest Mom" contestants, using crude humor. Pat O’Brien's public apology for his addictions was mocked, along with the interview on *The Insider*. A call from Opie’s brother, Joe, promoted his band's shows and merchandise.  Workplace conflict, stemming from staff members' unprofessional conduct around George Foreman, was highlighted via an internal email, further escalating into arguments and playful insults among the hosts.  Rumors about Boy George and Gavin Rossdale were also briefly mentioned.  The segment concluded with more offensive caller audio.

Finally, the show focused on bathroom pranks perpetrated by Jimmy, including inappropriate touching and water-splashing incidents, as well as the unauthorized guest booking attempts by Big Kev, causing conflict with management (D.C.) and executive producer Ben.  The unresolved conflict regarding Big Kev's future guest-booking role concluded the broadcast, interspersed with further off-color jokes and sound clips.

[00:00:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you for listening. 
[00:03:30]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us. 
[00:04:00]  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We're going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with Down Syndrome children.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Wow.  How stupid can't do it. 
[00:04:30]  How stupid can one person be?  Oh, no, not really.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  He was banging cocktail wages as two at a time.  I'm scared.  You're just a tool.  It's over, Jenny.  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body. 
[00:05:00]  We can freeze his head.  O-N-A, party rock!  O-N-A, party rock!  It's impossible.  I'm trying to tell you that.  What do you want?  You want the tears to come out of my eyes?  Fine.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, you guys. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, my, no!  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Warning, warning, warning.  You will be molested.  Good morning, and welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The O-N-A virus spreading across America, thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Hello.  We've got a bunch of things happening.  We've got to go right to the phone, actually, Anthony.  All right.  If you're a faithful listener of the show, you understand that we've got a lot of great 
[00:06:00]  people around us that work for free, and then we've got one dummy.  His name's Ricky.  Ricky.  But we love him.  We love all our children, even though one's a little special.  He is special, all right.  And it's been an ongoing thing.  He just can't get food orders right, and he takes twice as long as Travis.  By food orders, you mean anything, right?  He can't get anything right.  I was being nice, I guess.  We'll start with the food orders.  So, Travis, who's that go-getter that we love, we told him to follow Ricky to the Rock and 
[00:06:30]  Roll Deli today.  And he's on the phone.  Because we're trying to get to the bottom of it, why it takes him so long to get the  food orders.  So, let's say hi to Travis.  Travis, what's up?  Hello.  I'm outside the Rock and Roll Deli with Ricky.  And what's going on so far?  Well, Ricky actually just left.  He's going to get the bananas, because we have to get bananas from a different place, because  these are terrible.  So, he's going to get the bananas, but I watched Ricky, and now I know why it takes 
[00:07:00]  him a little longer.  All right.  Why is that, Travis?  Well, first of all, I think maybe I just have more common sense and good memory than he does,  because he pays for everything separately.  He'll pay for your food, then he'll pay for someone else's food, instead of doing it all  in one shot.  Oh, and then divvying up the rest of the change for everybody once you get here.  Exactly.  Whereas I sit down, and I figure out who's getting what, and then I just pay for everything 
[00:07:30]  separately, or together, rather.  Right.  He pays for everything separately.  Holy Jesus Christ.  No wonder it takes so long.  He went up to that register about ten times.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, because it's a big order every morning.  And then what?  He gets changed for every order and puts it aside, and then...  Yeah, pretty much.  And then he just keeps forgetting, oh, I need to get the blueberry yogurt for Jim.  Let me go get that.  Oh, I need to get Steve's Mountain Dews.  Let me go get back.  He can't go anymore.  He can't touch the food anymore. 
[00:08:00]  No.  There's no reason for him to be going.  Well, here's the problem.  Travis's internship is up soon, and I don't get this, man.  I've been on radio a long time, and there's a bunch of guys around here that are working  for free for us, because they just love being around the O.P. and Anthony show.  Who wouldn't?  And, you know, I'm talking about Danny and Nathaniel.  We finally got Derek a few bucks.  Nothing much, but we got him aboard.  And we're trying to figure out how to get Danny and Nathaniel aboard, because they're really,  really hard workers.  They work, I don't know, 40, 50 hours a week for free. 
[00:08:30]  And every once in a while, Anthony and I will give them a little pick-me-up, you know?  Once in a while?  Well, we did it once so far.  I think every once.  We did it once so far, but I don't know.  We'll give some more.  I'll buy him some beers if we're out in a bar.  Yeah.  That's kind of cool.  And they get lunch every once in a while and things like that.  But they're just go-getters, and they understand they're working for a really big radio show,  and there's going to be some opportunity, so they're just hanging and waiting.  Waiting for their opportunity.  Well, Travis wants to be the new, you know, one of these guys as well.  He wants to be like a Nathaniel and Dan. 
[00:09:00]  And XM Satellite Radio down there in Washington will not let Travis hang out for free.  Why?  I don't know.  They didn't give any reason?  No.  You know, he's got to get paid, or that's the end of his internship.  That doesn't make sense to me, because, you know, we obviously have to get Nathaniel and  Danny paid first, because they've been here longer.  Yeah.  So Travis is kind of like technically that low man on the totem pole.  And when I was coming up in the business, I did what these guys are doing. 
[00:09:30]  You hang out at a radio station because you love it, and you're hoping that, you know,  you're going to get an opportunity eventually.  That's what I did.  I wasn't getting paid.  I just came in because it was fun, and I wanted to get into the biz.  But as long as Travis understands that there's no guarantee that he's going to get a paying  job, but he still wants to come in and hang and do the food orders and learn and be part  of the show, I don't see where the problem is.  I don't either.  Because now, instead of being in an atmosphere that's, you know, really cool, that could lead  to something for the kid, because he's obviously into communications, his internship's going 
[00:10:00]  to end, and then what?  Yeah.  Then what does he get to do?  Nothing.  Well, he could...  Exactly.  They've got to work out a system down in Washington.  It doesn't make sense at all.  He'll come in.  If you've got someone like Travis that is just that motivated, you've got to let him hang  out for free.  Screw Washington.  They're in Washington.  Isn't Washington in Washington?  I think it is.  Yes.  We're in here in New York, so he can come in.  What are they going to do? 
[00:10:30]  The logic just amazes me.  I mean, you're talking about a kid that works his ass off for free, gives us really good  work.  He's smart.  Oh, he's on the phone.  Stop.  Hey, Travis.  Hear this.  And, you know, until we can figure out how to get these guys some more money, or money  in general, the kid should be allowed to hang out and continue his internship, even though  the semester's over.  Ah, look who's back.  It's Ricky.  Are you back already?  Yeah.  All right, then I'm on my way back. 
[00:11:00]  All right.  Thank you, Travis.  You're welcome.  Travis was spying on you today, Ricky.  Yeah.  Yep.  I don't like that.  I didn't think it was cool that Travis would spy on you like that.  What do you think?  Whatever.  He seems to have found a problem, and what might be taking you so long.  It's the fact that you pay for everything separately, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, instead, what you do, you write down what everybody's getting, and then write down what 
[00:11:30]  denomination of money they give you, right?  Yeah.  See, and then you go, and then you should pay for it all at once.  Just take a big lump of money and go, here.  There, and then you get the change back from that, and then you come back here, and using  some mathematics, you can figure out what everybody, uh...  Yeah.  And as long as you're close, no one's going to care.  Yeah.  Like, if Anthony gives you $20 for a bagel, as long as you give him $15, $16 bucks back,  he's not going to question it. 
[00:12:00]  If I get, like, $3 bucks back...  Yeah, and then there's a problem.  Then I'll be wondering, hmm, I think Ricky's trying to skim a little.  Just get it close.  Just get it close.  No one around here cares.  Yeah.  Maybe that'll speed things up.  That's why I just wanted to, like, get exact change, just so, you know, you guys don't  flip or not like that.  You are Pedro from, uh, Napoleon Dynamite.  Pedro.  What's the...  What are you thinking right now in that brain of yours?  Anything?  Nothing, right?  Not really.  Nothing going on.  There's absolutely nothing, just white noise.  White noise. 
[00:12:30]  Grave.  Well, if you have a thought, come on back into the studio, all right?  And thanks for the food.  No problem.  Although Jimmy said you should not be able to go for food anymore.  No, you should just get all the change at once, that's all.  Jimmy really doesn't like you.  It's not true.  Jimmy had some bad things to say about you when you weren't here.  Yeah.  Jimmy, why don't you tell him?  Tell him what you called him.  I didn't say anything.  It's not true. 
[00:13:00]  It's not true.  I don't believe these little white lies.  Do you want him to get your food?  No.  All right, well, tell him.  He's a good boy.  I wanted to hang up here.  I enjoy his company.  I hate when he's gone.  Vote for Pedro.  Vote for Pedro.  Vote for Pedro.  Vote for Pedro.  Vote for me.  Vote for Pedro.  Vote for me.  Vote for Pedro.  Vote for Pedro.  Vote for Pedro.  Ricky, you're a bad guy.  That is you.  I get the food, and sometimes I get the change wrong, but I try to do it right. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, Ricky.  And he grows the mustache like Pedro from Napoleon Dynamite.  All right, Ricky.  I'd say there were more brains in Little Precious Doe's head when they found it than there is in Ricky's.  He doesn't even know what that means.  Look at him.  He's just staring.  They didn't see the news yesterday.  They found, they identified Little Precious Doe, the little girl whose body and then head was found a couple of days later in a plastic bag. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, my.  Oh, that's.  Oh.  They called her Little Precious Doe.  Isn't that four years old, that case?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's an old case.  And it turns out the mom had something to do with it on the news right there.  Yeah, when they find their head in a different place, they tend to suspect foul play.  Yeah.  Wasn't a bizarre Barbie Funhouse accident or something?  Obviously.  Yeah.  All right, Ricky.  I'll play.  Ricky's dishing out the food for everybody. 
[00:14:30]  Thanks, sweetie.  There it is.  Anthony, how about...  Jimmy's opening up his...  Oh, boy.  This isn't going to be right?  Of course it is.  There it is.  All right.  Ooh, light and fit, Dannon.  Oh, light and fit.  Thank God, because you have Liddy.  Oh, yeah.  She yogurt Liddy.  She yogurt Liddy.  Hello.  The whole Liddy thing during the replay was really funny.  It was really funny and stupid at the same time.  He's making another one.  There it is.  Here comes Liddy.  Another is born.  Oh, boy.  Here's Liddy, everybody. 
[00:15:00]  Just don't touch the food end of the spoon there, you PR.  Oh, Liddy.  It looks like Liddy's...  You're incorrigible.  Liddy's a little more outrageous than Jimmy Izee.  All right.  And now he's just trying to figure out who's is who's.  Yeah, he's juggling everybody's food.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Unbelievable.  Hey, that's a great idea.  Someone is suggesting Joe from Brooklyn.  We just invite Travis as a guest every day on our show. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, he could be a guest every day.  Come in.  We'll say hello, and then he just goes and hangs out.  Helps people out.  Why not?  See it on the calendar inside the office.  Travis, Travis, Travis, Travis, Travis, Travis, Travis, Travis, Travis, Travis, Travis, Travis, Travis.  Anthony, you're calm considering you had a horrendous commute in today?  Yeah.  It took me about an hour to get in today.  It's a 20-minute drive, by the way.  Tops.  The funny thing is, there's two sides to this thing, by the way. 
[00:16:00]  I mean, we're all like clockwork.  We all arrive at pretty much the same time.  Same time every day.  Every day.  A couple of minutes.  And as soon as you see that, you know, someone is late, you know, it's like, oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  And when it's late, it's obviously because traffic is awful.  So we start looking at the local news, and sure enough, just a horrendous backup on the  Long Island Expressway, which is just the worst road in America.  I don't care where you live and you think you have the worst road in America.  The Long Island Expressway takes the cake, as they say.  If one little thing happens, if a cop pulls somebody over on the side of the road, not even 
[00:16:30]  blocking traffic, there will be a horrendous backup because people just stop, the volume  on the road is ridiculous at any time of the day.  I think it's the only road in America, and I've been to a lot of big cities now, it's  the only road in America it takes one, one, listen to me, one car to completely fuck it  up for everybody, one car.  Where now your commute is an hour, where it's usually 20 minutes. 
[00:17:00]  So I spent my time driving around some side streets in Queens, trying to join back up,  looking where the helicopters are, and then knowing I have to get past those before I  can get back on the expressway.  Hoping you guys are watching it here, and seeing some of those blood-stained yellow blankets  on the roadway, which unfortunately there weren't.  Because if somebody's inconveniencing me, I want them dead.  I don't want to have to know that they're still alive.  Anthony walks right into the office, and he's like, is there yellow blankets on the 
[00:17:30]  side of the road?  There better be.  There better be.  And no, apparently not.  What was it, an oil truck?  Yeah, something like that.  Let us drive through.  Let's go to Harry in Ohio.  I guess Lex and Terry weren't happy with us critiquing their little bit yesterday.  Oh, no.  Harry, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  What's up, Norton?  Hi, Harry.  How you guys doing?  Good.  Let's get right into it.  What's up?  Hey, man, these guys are dogging you all.  They're talking about you all need to bow down to Howard, give the guys some respect. 
[00:18:00]  And Opie, they're dogging your name, man.  It's like, this is a childhood name.  You've got red hair.  Oh, my God.  I'm completely trashing you guys.  I got red hair?  First of all, I don't.  Second of all, my nickname goes all the way back to 12.  I'm not happy about it.  It's not a radio name that I decide, hey, this would be cool on the radio.  It's been my name, unfortunately, since I was 12 years old.  Why are they kissing Howard's ass?  Why are morning guys doing that?  Ugh.  He's your competition, stupid.  They're going to help you?  Yeah.  They're trying to pave the way for some kind of relationship with them when they get thrown 
[00:18:30]  off or something?  Like, why would you?  Are they just, are they mentioning our names, Opie and Anthony?  Yeah.  Are they saying XM Satellite Radio a little bit?  Yes, they are.  There you go.  They fell right into our trap.  They're trying to tell you guys that you guys are not the gods of radio and that when  Howard comes to XM, he's going to kick your guys' ass.  Hey, good.  When Howard comes where?  Two of them.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, XM.  Very good. 
[00:19:00]  Thank you.  Yeah.  You know, it's a known fact, I mean, that we will have a larger audience when Howard goes  to Satellite Radio.  That is a fact.  You can look it up for yourself.  So, you know, Lex and Terry, just a bunch of guys that didn't really take major chances  in their careers, so they're stuck in these kind of mediocre markets.  So, you know, if it works for them, great.  They suck.  There's a lot of people, I hate to say it, but it's true, a lot of people jealous of the  success Anthony and I have had.  You know, they see the national coverage we get and they're not happy about it. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  I'm going to play them for you, man, but they done went into another bid.  I mean, I just walked out and got in my truck and started up.  And just another bunch of phonies, by the way, because we did some of these press junkets  with Lex and Terry back in the day, where, you know, they fly in for the Grammys or what  have you, and there's a million radio stations set up, and we don't do those anymore, but  and then they have the celebrities from one station to another, to another, to another,  to another.  Right here in New York, Grammys a few years ago, maybe a little longer than that, five, 
[00:20:00]  six years ago, we met Lex and Terry and they were nothing but nice to us and saying,  you know, nice to meet you and all that bullshit, so.  Well, I'll tell you what, you couldn't tell it this morning, because, oh, they're trashing  you guys.  Plus, they was talking about Norton, you know, the guy that never shuts up.  I don't know his name, but he's on the O&A show all the time.  Thinking, Jesus Christ, what the hell's going on?  Wow, we're so bad, but they know everything about our show. 
[00:20:30]  I couldn't tell you one thing about their show.  I know their names.  I've seen their names in the radio press and stuff, but I couldn't tell you, I couldn't  tell you who else is on the show.  I couldn't tell you what kind of bits they do.  I couldn't even tell you what markets they're in.  I know they're not in any of the big markets.  So.  I don't know nothing about them either.  I mean.  They played right into our hands.  I love when these guys play right into our hands, because we need all the exposure and  publicity we could get.  But so, you know, if they're syndicated here and there, and they're mentioning Opie and  Anthony and XM Satellite Radio, then once again, we've done our jobs. 
[00:21:00]  That they are doing.  All right.  Very good.  All right, brother.  Let's punch it out.  Thanks, Harry.  I don't know, man.  I don't want to have to deal with the wrath of Lex and Terry.  With chis bags.  No one knows you're stupid.  I love these guys.  They're just the worst.  Yeah.  Zoo crew jerk-offs.  I mean.  40-minute bit that wasn't working.  Yeah.  And you don't have the radio honesty.  To go, ah, this sucked.  If we stink, we'll acknowledge it.  You didn't have the fucking, the moral courage to admit that your bit stunk, and you kept 
[00:21:30]  going and fake laughing through it.  You dishonest nobody's.  You know, one of the things that Norton brought to this program, I think we were doing it a  little bit before Norton, but Norton really brought into the forefront is the whole, you  know, if you're bombing, to acknowledge it.  Mm-hmm.  I remember the day, especially in the early days with Anthony and I, if we were doing  a bit and it was bombing, we would try our best to just try to make it work and kind  of get through it and maybe do a little of that fake laughing, I've got to admit, just  to get, you know, just to make it sound like it's working. 
[00:22:00]  A little nervous.  A little nervous and stuff.  But you brought that whole, you know, angle to the show where, what'd you just say?  I mean, there was a time if I slurred a word or mispronounced something, I'm like, oh my  God, I hope no one, you know, caught that, oh God, oh God, oh God.  I'm supposed to be this professional broadcaster, but you were the one that brought it to the  table like, what was that word?  And then just smash it in the face.  And it's become a great part of the radio show, I've got to tell you.  But these other guys, you're right, they don't, they don't, they're not honest with what  they do on their, their program at all.  Mm-mm. 
[00:22:30]  Absolutely not.  Is there a chick on that show?  I have no idea, I couldn't tell you anything about them.  If anybody knows Lex and Terry, they're fucking two completely androgynous names, please let  us know if, either one could be a guy, either one could be a girl, fucking two trannies doing  a radio show.  Is there a chick on that show?  See, and they've been at it a lot longer than Anthony and I, you know, Anthony and I  have found the secret of getting, you know, going right to the top, you gotta, you know,  listen to your instincts, you don't listen to the bosses, you have to take chances, you  know, unfortunately sometimes you gotta get fired, you know, just so you can get to 
[00:23:00]  that next level.  Right.  And most of these guys out there, they're not willing to take any of those chances.  They'll act tough and cool on the air and make believe they're, they tell you how it  is, but they're not really telling you how it is.  Mm-mm.  At all.  And that's the difference between our show and pretty much most of the other shows out  there.  There's a few other guys that are doing what we're doing, but not Lex and Terry, that's  for sure.  All right, let's move on.  Pat from Rochester, what's up?  Oh, hold on.  We might have a little more info on this? 
[00:23:30]  This is always interesting, actually.  Ed in Pennsylvania, what's up, Ed?  Hey, not much.  Hey, the reason Howard, uh, the reason Lex and Terry are busting on you guys so much is  because, uh, Howard's befriending them because, uh, they seem to think that, uh, they're going  to serious with him.  Because he's been discussing, he wants to bring certain people to serious with him.  And don't they see, he's just, he's doing this so that they all, uh, talk about him  and give him the publicity and press that he's going to need when he goes over there. 
[00:24:00]  And he loves this adulation.  So he's hanging this little fish in front of everybody's face going, hey, I'll take you  to serious with me.  Oh, I think I'm going to give you, um, a spot on one of my channels and this and that.  So they all start kissing, spitting food out, kissing his ass.  All these, uh, all these little shows out there just hoping they're going to get the  call from Howard when Howard goes to Satellite Radio.  We're the only show that said, fuck you, Howard.  You fucking dick.  The guy, the guy has never helped anyone else in his, uh, in his entire career. 
[00:24:30]  And never will.  He's a scumbag behind the scenes that, that whines and cries and, and, and puts, uh, gag  orders on his fellow, uh, radio broadcasters.  The guy's a dick.  Instead of, instead of fighting, instead of fighting back, he goes to, you know, the big  bosses and makes, uh, makes people on his own, uh, on his own station or in his own company  shut the hell up.  That's, that's, that's great.  That's what, that's what you want from your, uh, your, your radio guy. 
[00:25:00]  All right.  Let's just put them kissing his ass, man.  And you guys are the best.  Punching out.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Pat in Rochester.  What's up, Pat?  Hi.  Are you talking to me?  Pat?  I take, I take pride in the fact that we didn't need Howard's help to make a name for ourselves  in this business.  Kiss his ass.  That'll get you far.  Everyone else, all you others, you could go kiss his ass.  Kiss his ass.  See where it gets you.  Yeah.  Could I have a spot?  Shut up.  Shut up.  Ass.  Go ahead, Pat. 
[00:25:30]  Uh, this is Pat in Boston.  Pat.  Am I on the air?  Who is this?  Hey, I have a question for Professor Anthony.  Uh-oh.  Yes.  Uh, regarding contracting, uh, mouth therapies, um, do you feel that Opie got them from an  Eggo pig or, you know, phone around with the boys at the DK house?  Ah.  Hmm.  This is someone that went to Geneseo, right?  No, no, no.  I'm from Boston.  I'm just a big fan.  Oh.  No, I think I got my, uh, my swamp mouth that comes up every once in a while and my cold 
[00:26:00]  sores from probably a stupid aunt that had one when I was a kid.  I've been getting them since I was, I, I, since I can remember walking.  You think a relative gave you a...  Oh, that's how it, I think that, well, you know better than I.  No, I don't know anything about that.  I think that's all, I think that's all it takes.  That's one subject I really don't know about.  You're lucky.  I, no, I've been getting the cold sores since I, I can remember, man.  And it, and, uh, supposedly, you know, it's all it takes is someone that has one of those 
[00:26:30]  things on their mouth and they're kissing you and that's it.  Great.  Nice aunt or something.  Somebody.  Oh.  I mean, who are you kissing at like six or seven?  You know, maybe aunts.  Your mom.  My mom didn't have it.  My dad didn't have it.  Grandma with the open mouth.  Maybe grandma.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Can you imagine?  So.  Chuck from, uh, is it Louisiana or L.A.?  Yeah, L.A., Los Angeles.  There you go.  Hey, dude, I gotta ask you, I'm a little annoyed today. 
[00:27:00]  I gotta ask you something.  Go ahead.  Do you listen to the channel, uh, later at night?  Sometimes on the way home.  I go to work real early in the morning, so I'm, I'm on the road at four.  I'm getting a lot of complaints and I'm just amazed that we haven't figured this out,  uh, yet.  But basically, like this show we're doing right now, we'll, uh, replay all day long.  And on the West Coast, it'll end at eight o'clock at night.  That's it for the new show.  And then they go into some kind of best of thing for a couple hours, right?  Yeah, there are a couple of replays and then after, I don't say up that late, because that 
[00:27:30]  would be up real early, but I, on Fridays I listen.  And yeah, it goes into, like, uh, worst of it.  I think, yeah, eight o'clock at night, something like that.  Yeah, eight o'clock at night on the West Coast, they're going into some dumb worst of, uh,  usually the bits are stuff that have been played a million fucking times.  Why don't they just...  Old shit.  Old shit.  Keep rerunning the show.  And then they finally, like, uh, you know, I gotta get, I gotta get the details, but  then finally, a couple hours later, then they play, they'll play this show again, but it'll  now be after midnight or around, uh, or around 10 o'clock at night or something like that. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  That's just dumb programming.  I don't get why we don't have that figured out eight months down the road here.  A lot of times it's stuff from, like, the first free play.  I mean, from months ago.  Wow.  Bad.  It's really bad, because, I mean, we have to look at this as a national, uh, show.  So you're, uh, you're just telling the West Coast, uh, yeah, you guys don't matter, you  know, at eight o'clock.  Eight o'clock!  Eight o'clock.  You know how many people are really listening to the radio at eight o'clock?  That's a good time to listen.  And sometimes it can drive you insane, because if I'm not up this early, you know, there's 
[00:28:30]  stuff that was happening early in the morning that, you know, you don't get to participate  in, because it's all replay, replay, you know, but time difference.  What can you do?  Right, right.  Anthony, you son of a bitch.  Wait, hold on a second.  We're trying to get to the, hold on one second, Chuck.  I'll go back to you.  Tom in Kentucky.  What's up, Tom?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  What's up, sweet kids?  Hi, Tom.  Hey, uh, I was on yesterday.  It was the one that brought you Lex and Terry.  Oh, yeah.  Well, we, hold on, hold on.  I'd like to set this up.  We love when you guys, uh, do the wacky radio thing for us. 
[00:29:00]  That's how that bit's gonna go.  If you hear, if you hear something happening locally on one of those dumb little shows, we want  to, we want to listen in.  So just keep that in mind, okay?  We have given that bit to the listeners.  You hear wacky radio out there, you call us, and we go right to you.  But go ahead, Tom.  Uh, Lex and Terry are the, you know, two little faggots with no radio show are trashing y'all  this morning.  They're on the radio talking about y'all are a bunch of has-beens.  Nobody really ever liked you. 
[00:29:30]  And when, uh, Howard-  Hold on, hold on.  No one in radio liked us, that's for sure.  We had, we had maybe a handful of, uh, friends.  So they're, they're, they're right about that.  The rest of them, the rest of them are, I can't even tell you, man.  We, we have to get into this someday.  That this business is filled with just a bunch of hacks that have no business, uh, business  broadcasting at all.  Well, they just kept going on and on and on about how, when Howard came on and said he  was going to XM, y'all went running scared.  That's why y'all are off the premium channel. 
[00:30:00]  And it just totally blew me away because I was listening to the show and y'all were  the ones that was talking about cutting up the rosy bits and using it in some kind of  a playback motion.  The very next day, they're doing a 900 number with the same idea and it ain't even working.  It's totally blowing.  I mean, it's like, oh, this sucks so bad.  I was like, oh God, I got to call these guys.  Well, that's why, that's why they're spending a lot of time talking about us today, which is  really helping us out.  And I want to thank them for that. 
[00:30:30]  Cause you know, you're not going to get under our skin here.  You're just not, uh, uh, radio guys will not get under our skin ever.  But the funny thing is if they're blasting and losing their minds today, it just means  we really got under their skin yesterday.  They knew that bit was bombing.  It was bombing in front of a national audience and we called them out on it and they can't  take it.  They just can't take it.  Isn't that great?  They're bombing.  And then because of us, they're bombing nationwide.  Well, Kentucky's totally got the virus, dude.  We're infected. 
[00:31:00]  Punch it out.  Thanks, man.  That cornball phone call that was getting nothing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, listen to what she's saying now.  This is classic.  Yuck.  What's classic about it?  For any other radio guys listening, cause they all do have a satellite radio.  I mean, radio guys were the first ones to get satellite radio.  Cause you know, in the end, you're really into the, the whole concept of radio.  So you're, you're going to pick up the new technology and start listening.  And they're the ones that know radio really stinks.  If you want to go on your show and trash us, that's fine. 
[00:31:30]  Just make sure you say Opie and Anthony and maybe, maybe say satellite.  That's fine.  And you just watch how, how, how has been we are.  You just sit back and watch what happens next.  I'm sure they do a terrific radio show.  Fun, fun little local show.  I never heard of them.  All right.  Chuck from LA.  I'm sorry.  So you have a question for Anthony?  Yeah.  And I have to admit first, I work on a morning show here in LA too.  And I am a radio guy.  I've had satellite radio.  I told you, man, I didn't even know we were going to go to satellite radio.  And as soon as I got fired, we got fired, whatever. 
[00:32:00]  My brother bought it for me, you know, a month or two later.  I've been, I've been listening to XM for, it's got to be three years now.  Yeah.  Or when we were fired, whatever.  Cause someone's going to call me out on that.  A little less than three years.  We left off with me calling Anthony a son of a bitch.  Yes.  And what show do you work on in LA?  It's a news show on an LA news station.  I do the traffic for them.  Ooh, but I'm, but I'm down by infinity too.  You know, it'd be a conflict of interest if I mentioned where, so I won't, but.  Well, that's a traffic reporter in LA. 
[00:32:30]  That's, that's kind of important.  I always laugh when I go on vacation.  Like you go down to Miami, South beach or one of those really Orlando.  My sister lives down there and you watch the local news and they have a weatherman.  I'm like, that guy has the best job in America.  Really?  Nothing happens.  It goes where they just keep replaying the same shit from all week.  They might as well.  This is weather forecast from 1992 and no one has noticed.  You've got the cool cop chases out there, huh?  Oh, it's great. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  And it's raining today, so it'll be, it'll be a lot of fun.  I have a five hour shift and it'll be, it'll be cranking the whole time.  I'm sure.  All right.  So what do you got for Anthony?  Anthony, you son of a bitch.  You got me hooked on these damn ass wipes.  And I.  The ass wipes.  Lex and Terry.  And I, and I went to my son's baseball game the other day and I had a little something  going on down there.  Had to take care of, and I didn't have access to those.  And I got the cranky ass.  See, isn't it, it sucks when you don't have it.  After you have it, you get used to it, and then all of a sudden they're not there one 
[00:33:30]  day.  Oh.  I could not wait to get home and take care of that business.  Take care of business with a nice little wipe.  Yeah, I don't have that, I don't have that action anymore thanks to you, Anthony.  Isn't it great?  I, I, I, I've been, I've been stockpiling.  Like you said the other day, you're kind of stockpiling.  Every time I go to the market, I know I have them at home, but you know what?  Anything could happen.  I can't get to the store and, you know.  Load up some more.  Anthony has turned the whole O&A audience on to baby wipes.  I'm just trying to clean up the assholes in this country. 
[00:34:00]  That's right.  And the funny thing is, Club Soda Kenny turned me on to it, but he's so big and stupid,  I'm like, this guy's out of his mind.  I'm not listening to him, but when Anthony tells you, you gotta get the baby wipes.  Check it out at least.  You gotta at least check it out.  Give a box a try, and see how that goes for you.  I think you should give some baby wipes to your mom this Mother's Day.  Oh, maybe.  It's a good gift.  There you go.  You know what they really come in handy for?  There have been those situations where you're sitting there and you're done.  You're completely done with your business, but you have to sit longer because, you know. 
[00:34:30]  The old South 40 is in flames, you know.  You can't really take care of anything because you're burning up a bit.  You're burning up on re-entry.  So instead of sitting there forever, now you have the lovely wipes.  They're cool to the touch, little moist.  Little moist, but not too moist.  Not too moist.  No, you don't feel wet.  No, you don't feel that.  But it cools the fire, and you can get back to business.  It's a lifesaver. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, it really is.  Is there anything worse than diarrhea?  Yeah.  When your cheeks get really red and sore, you have to just dab them.  Ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow.  You can't, like, rub the toilet paper.  That's what I mean.  You take some of these wipes now.  Oh, and you just cram them up there.  Oh, boy.  You're just cooled down.  Club Starter Kenny needs them because his intestines are just awful.  There's a story of one time.  He was working with Dyson to pull the limo over so he could run out and shit, like, on  the Staten Island Expressway at the median. 
[00:35:30]  He had to shit, like, at those little trees along the Staten Island Expressway.  Just let one out.  Yeah.  Couldn't wait.  Fucking stupid head poking over like Mighty Joe Young.  I'm almost done.  Dumping the shrubs.  Somebody by the parking garage I go to, one of the entrances, was walking in, and you  know it wasn't a dog or anything because, first of all, they wouldn't take a dog down  there, and it was just too big and human-like.  Just left a huge log right by the entrance to the parking garage. 
[00:36:00]  And every day when I walk by, I've just been watching it decompose on a daily basis.  I should have done some kind of time-lapse photography on it.  That's funny.  Could have made a little movie of it rotting away.  But some homeless guy, you know, just squatted against the wall and took a dump.  I was going to blame a dog owner.  Most of these dog owners, they don't give a crap.  If you're caught-  No, it's human.  No, this one was human.  I was thinking about the dog owners in my hood.  I mean, the ticket for getting caught- I know, I keep calling them the hood.  The hood.  The ticket for getting caught not picking up the dog poo is like, it's only a $100 ticket 
[00:36:30]  or something like that.  Only a hundred bucks, Opie.  No, no, no, no.  Well, me a bag of shells.  Dude, trust me.  In my neighborhood, I'm the low man, and these people don't care.  Well, I hope he gave $100 just to pay for the ticket for the dog shit.  And these people-  That's not me.  Remember.  Remember the yogurt schedule, people.  I'm not taking blame for the fact that Jimmy's scraping the bottom of his yogurt.  Early morning scraping is Jimmy. 
[00:37:00]  Mine is about nine, I think about nine o'clock you'll be hearing.  People hear that?  Oh, yeah, they hear it.  Stop.  It drives people's mouth.  You know, when it's not me, I'm with the listeners.  That is really annoying.  But these people, these dog owners, they just let their dogs crap all over the sidewalks.  They don't care because they get caught.  It's only $200, and they're only going to get caught every once in a while.  There's notes all over my neighborhood.  I mean, notes that people are threatening violence that they find.  Oh, dude, I should bring some of them in. 
[00:37:30]  They're really funny.  It is disgusting.  I mean, you watch the people with the baggie on their hand.  Yeah.  Oh, and they just take this steaming pile up in their hand.  I don't care that you've got a baggie on.  I would need a baggie and a suit of armor before I even-  Because to get that hot pudding consistency even through the bag, you know you're feeling it.  You know what's even funnier about that?  They had the pooper scooper or whatever, and that just didn't take over at all. 
[00:38:00]  Because now you've got this shit-caked thing in your house.  And then someone had to do the little sandwich baggie first.  Yeah.  Someone decided, hey, this is the way you pick a poop off the sidewalk.  And then someone else had to see that and go, wow, that's a great idea.  And that's how it spread.  Like the virus.  That's how the virus is spread, people.  There it is.  That's why we call this show the O&A virus.  Everybody thought, well, that makes sense.  Ben, your block, your block, Opie's block has more shit than any block, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:38:30]  And notes all over.  I mean, people just threatening violence.  You should just report them.  Huh?  Report them.  Call 311.  You don't know.  I report you.  I don't even note with it.  Yeah, that's the beauty of it.  You see the crap.  You can't report the person because they're already gone.  You don't know where they are.  There's a woman on my block that's like a Nazi.  She watches for that stuff.  Really?  Yeah, she calls the cops, which is, you know, a waste of time calling the cops.  But, yeah.  It's like a $100 ticket or something like that.  Well, that's all.  Juden!  Juden!  I see them, yeah?  Which is like the old lady in fucking Marathon Man. 
[00:39:00]  Zell!  Zell!  There's a white angel.  His dog has shit on 6th Avenue.  I know you, you murderer.  Zell!  Cuts the guy's throat.  Help!  This man needs a pooper scooper.  Yeah, your neighborhood, man.  You got some of those nasty old people with those little dogs. 
[00:39:30]  Let me correct you, Anthony.  What?  Our neighborhood.  Oh, that's right.  Jimmy has moved into the neighborhood.  Jimmy is now up there.  Yes.  You got to deal with those people now.  We now live, what, two, three blocks away from each other?  Very close, yeah.  Very close.  I'm a little farther west.  That's great.  You can almost open your windows up and yell,  Hey, fuckface!  Right out the window.  I don't think we need phones anymore.  Hey, sociopath!  You know, we both come from good families, 
[00:40:00]  and we felt like this would help our relationship,  but we're not ready to live together,  but we figure we need to live close together.  Close together.  There's a Starbucks in between us.  We can just meet at and talk.  That's great.  You kids can go out and play stickball out on the street.  Go harass the fruit cart salesman.  He wheels his fruit down the road.  I could go old school,  just open up my window and call out for Jimmy,  see if he wants to play.  Jimmy!  Jimmy!  You want to go to the park?  I'll be moved in this month. 
[00:40:30]  That's very exciting for you.  I'm very happy.  That's great.  I'm thinking of maybe buying something finally.  Yeah, it's smoking hot.  Are you?  I think it's about time.  Yeah, something in the city?  Eh.  Like Jimmy?  Sick of paying for three mortgages and getting nothing out of it.  Yeah, tell me about it.  The guy who I bought from is...  I own a house somewhere in Huntington.  I've never seen it, but I know damn well I paid for it.  I got the checks to prove it.  Wait, you don't get to go there and hang out?  Oh, yeah.  You should be able to go there and hang out.  I should be able to go there and hang out. 
[00:41:00]  I should be able to go there and hang out.  That would be so funny, man.  Knock on the door.  Knock, knock.  Just take over the house for a few hours.  Yeah, I paid for this place.  Why not?  That's funny.  Isn't that great?  That's really good.  So, yeah.  So I own a place, but...  Eh.  Eh.  Eh.  Eh.  Mike from Kansas.  What's up, Mike?  Yeah, two years from now, you guys live in two blocks from each other,  probably never have even fed to each other's houses.  Oh, sure.  I've been to his place many times, and he's actually...  When I was looking at places, he actually came and checked it out with me, 
[00:41:30]  and I just wanted his opinion.  No, with Jim in the hood, I'll be over there.  Yeah.  I'll definitely be over there.  I used to skate down to Jimmy's place so we could grab food every once in a while.  I never saw Jimmy's old place.  Never went there.  The view is cool, actually, but if the rent's going up, it's just...  He had a nice place.  Yeah.  Speaking of skating...  Take your rocks with you?  You're going to take your rocks with you?  Yes, I'm bringing the rocks with you.  Are you setting them up and everything?  You got your place?  Did you look around your new place and go,  Oh, I could put my rocks there.  I'm going to hang my photos.  It's funny.  The guy who I bought from is such a... 
[00:42:00]  He's kind of a scumbag because he wanted more money for the place.  Because I'll give you your money back.  He's like, I want it to bite his fucking face.  Because he wants to put it back on the market and get more money.  $100 to speak.  I mean, it wasn't like that.  It's just so annoying that he wanted me to...  The place went up in value since Jimmy, you know...  Since we signed on the contract.  Yeah, so...  Tax break. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, nice.  That says love.  I have to respect that, yeah.  That says love right there.  Was she mail order Russian?  I don't know.  No, I think she's in school. 
[00:43:00]  She's actually really nice.  Yeah.  She was really honest.  Because they apparently have a place in the Hamptons.  My husband is a fucking prick.  I tell you.  I know this.  The speakers, he's like, I don't want to give him a credit.  I mean, like a credit for like, you know, it was like $400 off what I was paying.  Because the speakers weren't there.  And they said that they would be.  And he's like, I'll just give him the speakers.  And she goes, but they're in the Hamptons.  Because this guy's rich.  He's got like a place in the Hamptons.  He's got like three places.  Hoo-hoo.  I want the speakers rapid. 
[00:43:30]  Hoo-hoo.  So...  Wow.  A place in the Hamptons, too.  Yeah, this guy is just...  This is just something he had.  He's just dumping it.  You can't respect that, though.  He's a dummy.  Yeah.  Because he's going to lose all that money and more when he, you know, gets the big D down the road.  Oh, he has a prenup?  No, I heard them talking about it in the office.  Really?  Yeah, his lawyer was great.  His lawyer was honest.  Wow.  Let's see.  My ex is there.  I love people that talk about their prenups in public.  My ex is there.  Because, you know, she's one of my best friends.  And she's a psychopath.  Everybody knows she's nuts.  I love this girl, man. 
[00:44:00]  She's Erin from the original Run Around the Park for Erin.  Uh-huh.  We dated.  Well, they met on our show, Anthony.  Remember the girl that came in and wanted to be smacked really hard?  Yeah.  In the face, right?  Yeah.  And Jimmy smacked her really hard in the face?  And that kind of hooked them up.  That started off a fine five, six-year relationship.  That's cute.  Well, we dated.  Yeah, she's actually one of my best friends.  And it's like, I'm never friends with the exes.  I hope most of them are dead.  But with her, she's just such a nut.  You can't not be fighting her.  Yeah.  And every time you hang out with her, she has another just kook story.  How she was almost kidnapped in Jamaica last time. 
[00:44:30]  She is fucking nuts.  But she's just a complete psycho.  She called me from Jamaica.  I was almost kidnapped that the tourism board should be fucking shot for recommending this place.  It's like, what are you talking about?  You fucking kook.  Big tits hanging out of the fucking dress yesterday.  Oh, it was great.  Really?  Just to watch these old men just kind of, where do you work?  Just trying to hook up and see if they're a banger.  Oh, she's just the worst.  It's great.  The best story is how she stuck some kind of antenna up her ex-boyfriend's ass to teach him a lesson.  Or to see if he was awake.  Yeah.  Whoa!  She was fighting with her ex-boyfriend and he passed out or something. 
[00:45:00]  And she just put a cell phone antenna in his ass just to see if he was really passed out.  Dude, she goes out with this guy.  Or did.  I don't really know.  She did.  Yeah, they split up.  I sat at Starbucks once with these two.  Just in amazement.  She told one story after another and I guess she goes out with this guy that has some kind of weird OCD that he has to move every year or something.  Yeah.  He can't stay in the same apartment for what?  Every year or every few months?  Every year, I think.  And he won't buy a place because he's kind of afraid of being kind of weighed down. 
[00:45:30]  And the guy makes just stupid money.  Sick money.  So he's moving out of penthouse apartments every year all over New York City.  Wow.  Because he has this whacked out thing.  And they had this huge fight and she broke his huge plasma.  $7,000 television.  $7,000 television.  And then stuck an antenna up his ass to see if he was awake.  Yeah.  I think he just passed out and she just did it to make sure that he was really asleep.  Wow.  That would be the test.  That's good.  It's funny.  That's good.  I mean, was she laughing when she told the story? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, she knows she's nuts.  Yeah, that is funny.  I never had those kind of fights with her.  We never thought about money.  We never thought about it.  She always tells me I had an awful boyfriend and I was like, I wasn't around.  It's like, yeah.  That's the biggest complaint.  That's you, though.  Yeah.  You're busy.  You're doing comedy.  Now, you guys are better just being friends.  And I'm fine being friends with her.  I'm totally comfortable.  That would be such a volatile relationship.  Well, it's always cool when you go to a wedding the next day and you're in your place in Jersey  and your girlfriend's running to the bathroom at 3 o'clock in the morning and bringing her purse.  You know, she's not doing coke at 3 in the morning.  No. 
[00:46:30]  That's normal.  You bring your cosmetics to the bathroom.  I'm like, do you think I'm fucking stupid?  I'm an addict.  I know what you're doing.  Can you imagine that you have to deal with that?  Doing blow at 3 in the morning.  And you can sense them wide-eyed and awake in the dark next to you.  Yeah.  Fucking, it's like, how would you go to sleep?  Your teeth grinding.  That always used to suck when you fell for a girl and then realized that the person was just a kook  or there was something severely wrong with her. 
[00:47:00]  Like, what was going through your head when you went, oh, no.  This girl is doing coke at 3 in the morning and I really like her, but I don't want to deal with this crap.  Maybe I could turn her around.  A lot of guys do that out there.  No, I knew I couldn't from day one.  I told her the first date we had, it was after we hung out that night.  We went back to the car.  We fooled around a little bit.  And she doesn't care if I tell us at all.  And we went to the comedy cellar.  And we're going to have a nice night together.  And she said, can I borrow 20 bucks?  I'm like, all right.  So I'm like, all right.  She's probably going to score coke.  I won't see her again.  She comes back like an hour later. 
[00:47:30]  I'm like, what happened?  She's like, ah, they robbed me at knife points.  Our first date, she goes to Washington Square Park to buy coke and gets robbed at knife points.  Comes back in and we just hang out.  Isn't that amazing?  Did she ask you for another 20?  No, she was cool about it.  She was just hung out.  She was like, all right, whatever.  Wow.  Our first date.  What a kook.  And I fall in love.  Great date.  Yeah.  And to you, that was like, hey, this chick's kind of cool.  I knew it immediately.  There's problems here.  Let's go to Dan in Jersey.  Hey, Dan.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Hey, frigging other day I haul shit for a living.  So we're going to go get rid of the load. 
[00:48:00]  Fucking buddy gets to the place and goes, dump the shit.  Frigging opens up the cap.  All shit from head to his toe in his fucking mouth and his eyes.  All over the fucking place.  Why?  Because he forgot to close the valve when he went to the place.  Ah.  That is awful.  I got to go and haul a load of manure.  So.  All right.  Good door.  Apparently our audio is cutting in and out and in and out.  What?  What's up, Eric?  We just found out that for some reason the whole northeast of the country is skipping in and out. 
[00:48:30]  They're working on it.  All right.  Whose fault is that?  Because I came in here and said that that was a problem at 6 in the morning.  That's not us.  It's satellite.  Is it every channel?  That's why I'm asking whose fault is that?  We'll find out.  If it's not us, that's fine.  But what's the problem?  I think it's outer space's fault.  Yeah.  Could be outer space.  Could be the sun's fault.  Because I was skating through the park and I heard this.  I heard it too.  I heard this coming in and I went right to Mars and said, look, what is going on?  Skating to Mars.  So I told people right at 6 a.m. that there was some kind of problem. 
[00:49:00]  They're finding out right now.  Is it just our channel?  I don't believe so.  I believe it's the other channels too.  The whole signal is just cutting in and out.  Interesting.  Could be a satellite problem.  Yeah.  Might be.  Might be sunspots.  Is the show, we're recording it nice, so when they replay it over the weekend, they'll  at least hear what they missed?  No problem on our end here.  Can you put the skips in the recording so we can...  Over the weekend, you could, yeah.  Catch what you missed. 
[00:49:30]  Catch all the things you missed.  Unless you just missed that statement, then you won't know to listen to the weekend.  Dude, it was so frustrating.  I was ready to just throw my MIFI.  I was skating in through the park, and we'd do the intros to the 6 a.m. hour, those bits  before we go live at 7 a.m. on the East Coast.  Yeah.  And there was some really funny stuff.  You were talking about your yoga position stuff, and I remember recording it the other  day.  And it's just like, every...  Yoga.  Funny Jimmy.  And I'm like, I was losing my mind. 
[00:50:00]  Mr. Motherfucker from Wack Bag says, just the Northeast.  I'm in Wisconsin, and it's happening here, too.  God damn it.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  All right, everyone's checking in now.  Colorado's saying it's skipping, too.  Colorado's part of, of course, you know, the Northeast.  It's New England.  Just what I was told.  It's in New England.  Hawk, what's going on?  I just told you what I was told.  Don't drink any Dr. Pepper in the morning.  Yeah, it's not good for you.  It's unhealthy?  Really?  Yeah, it's really unhealthy.  No, it stinks, too, Dr. Pepper.  No one enjoys that.  Soda in the morning.  I don't know why people are still drinking Dr. Pepper with all those great sodas out 
[00:50:30]  there.  You really think you're a pepper, don't you?  You want to be a pepper, too?  He's a pepper.  Ugh.  I'm a pepper.  Dr. Pepper's just awful.  And why is it called Dr. Pepper?  Dr. Pepper.  There's no pepper taste to it.  Probably some rapist physician who would blast girls with mace.  You've been teabagged by Dr. Pepper, bitch.  Good fucking braining with a hammer.  A guy from American Werewolf in London used to do the commercials for that.  He would dance around.  What's his name? 
[00:51:00]  David Norton.  David Norton.  That's right.  That's probably N-A-U-G-H-T-O-N-A-C-O.  Yes.  Yes.  And he used to dance and sing the Dr. Pepper song and do the I'm a pepper, you're a pepper.  And then he did that song.  What song did he do?  He had a hit song back in the 70s.  Making It.  Making It.  Making It.  Ugh.  Remember that one?  It was awful.  Do we have that?  David Norton.  I don't know.  We're looking it up.  Did you actually find that song? 
[00:51:30]  You found it?  This is the American Werewolf in London guy.  And this was a hit?  And the Dr. Pepper guy.  Usually it's good.  Do you remember this, kind of?  I need some vocals, I guess.  You need a little vocal action.  Sounds like every song that was happening in the late 70s.  Oh, okay.  This was him?  This is him.  Singing it.  When his actual vocal kicks in.  Didn't William Mason kill himself for this song in Boogie Nights?  Did he? 
[00:52:00]  No.  It sounds like that to the Bible, right?  I've got the chance.  I'm jacking it.  No more.  No more.  I'm jacking it.  Turn it off.  Turn my cock and jacking it.  Turn it off!  Thank you.  Hey, instant feedback.  Are people saying it's working now?  My instant feedback doesn't work.  There it is.  I'm kidding, of course.  Stop it.  Well, at least Nevada is just fine and dandy.  All right.  There you go.  He might be back.  He was also the alcoholic on Seinfeld. 
[00:52:30]  Thank you, Pat from Munaki.  Ooh.  Mm-hmm.  Just your channel.  The other day.  Just your channel cutting out.  That's what I thought this morning.  Sound fine in California.  All right.  We're back, I guess.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll regroup.  I have a thought starter.  Sounds great in Maine.  You have a thought starter?  I think so.  Is it a tease?  You want to tease it, or you want to just come back and...  We'll just come back.  He'll forget about it.  Maybe Liddy should give us a radio tease.  Oh.  Where's G-Yogurt Liddy? 
[00:53:00]  Here's Liddy.  Norton's new friend.  I'm only a piece of plastic, but I'm still more funny and creative than anything Lex and  Terry ever did.  Cancer for you two.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, Liddy.  We loved Eddie, but he was a little slow.  He was like...  A little slow.  No, it could have been Rosie O'Donnell's brother in that movie that was on the other night.  You know what?  They gave him the job of taking the garbage out. 
[00:53:30]  This was his job.  Take the garbage out.  Dude, you know he can't trash Eddie.  I'm not trashing him.  I'm just kind of telling him...  Wait, you think he could work an XM radio?  I wouldn't worry about it.  He's not hearing this.  Good point.  Whenever you give somebody who's a little mentally challenged a job, they will talk about it to  you like it is the most important thing in the world.  It's very important to them, Andy.  Very important.  You know, the garbage don't stop.  Every day is all this garbage.  Garbage, garbage, garbage.  I remember once he was going on vacation and he was very worried that no one would take 
[00:54:00]  care of the garbage.  Yeah.  That it was going to pile up.  Like it's going to pile up and Viacom is going to go under.  Who's going to take care of the garbage?  I'm essential to the Viacom effort.  You're still there, probably.  He's still there.  He lasted a lot longer than we did.  Of course he is.  So go ahead, Anthony.  So that was his job.  I don't know how that translated into giving him the job of delivering the mail.  So you'd go up to your mailbox.  It was like a bunch of little cubby holes in the wall that had everyone's mail in it.  It had your little name tag on it. 
[00:54:30]  And you'd grab your mail out of it and look through it.  And every name that worked at Viacom was in your mailbox except for yours.  And you'd look around.  And remember, our checks would be in there, paychecks.  And like I'd pull it out and go, oh, Earl Douglas.  Great.  I have Earl's paycheck.  And you know it's not going to be that much because he's a black guy.  You can barely get lunch on his paycheck.  And Earl somewhere is buying a brand new BMW with your paycheck.  So he would just walk around and just, he would just take like four envelopes and shove them in one of the holes, 
[00:55:00]  take three of another, shove them in another hole, not paying attention.  And then every so often he'd come in the office, point at someone, and go, who this?  Who this?  And he'd point at the name.  And if he did that to Ben's day, it said Earl Douglas on it.  Ben would go, oh, yeah, that's Don Geronimo.  And still he couldn't read anyone's name tag, so he would just shove it in. 
[00:55:30]  And we used to explode.  But we didn't want to get Eddie in trouble or make him feel bad.  So we could never say it on the air.  Well, the other thing is you were going through a lot of heavy personal shit.  Oh, my God.  And you had a lot of.  I had no address.  My ex-wife was living at my place in Huntington.  So my mailing address was 888 7th Avenue.  It was the NEW building.  That was my mailing address where I got bills and legal things and stuff for my divorce and everything. 
[00:56:00]  So all of a sudden, my cell phone gets turned off.  And I'm like, where is my. . .  And then I'm thinking, oh, my God, I haven't gotten a phone bill in months.  And I look, and apparently Eddie was throwing them away.  Because occasionally he would just throw the mail away.  Stop garbage.  Look like garbage.  Garbage, garbage.  Garbage.  You know, garbage never stops, guys. 
[00:56:30]  Garbage never stops.  And he would throw them away.  And then we would get these big packages.  Once there were mic flags.  Then we got a big delivery of mic flags.  Those little cubes with the company logo, the station logo that goes on your microphone.  And we were wondering why it was taking so long to get these things.  We were doing a lot of press at the time.  A lot of TV stations would come in and tape us.  And there was nothing identifying what station we were on on the microphone.  So we ordered a bunch of mic flags. 
[00:57:00]  And every so long we'd be like, where are the mic flags?  We never got them.  It turns out Eddie had received the box and put it in a storage closet without telling anybody.  Just opened up the big. . .  And it was a mechanical closet where the air conditioning units are and stuff.  The big lower furnace units and everything.  And just threw the box in there.  And then the time with the televisions.  The TVs.  It was like 30 TVs.  30 TVs were coming upstairs. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, yeah.  Another prize thing.  There were prizes or TVs that were going to be used for 1010 Winds.  The sister station upstairs.  So they came to the freight elevator downstairs.  And Eddie's in charge of bringing them up.  So wasn't it one of the homeboys?  Yeah, it was the homeboys and it was the guys in the garage.  And the guys in the garage.  And the homies went, hey, Eddie, can I have one of those TVs?  Oh, sure.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  No problem.  Guys.  Eight TVs missing.  Eight TVs missing.  They came in and just ravaged this retard television delivery. 
[00:58:00]  It's like, Eddie, where are the TVs?  Oh, a couple of guys downstairs took them.  No, you idiot.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Is someone getting the best?  The best.  The best.  The best.  The best.  The best of you.  Is someone getting the best?  The best.  The best. 
[00:58:30]  The best of you.  Has someone taken your face?  It's real.  The pain you feel.  You trust.  You must.  You're best.  Is someone getting the best?  The best.  The best.  The best of you.  I like that.  Brand new Poo Fighters.  As we come back from break.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  All right.  I guess they're trying to figure out that satellite problem, but it's not that bad anymore.  No.  I heard it's annoying, but not like really bad where you can't understand the show.  Man, we are taking, maybe they don't want us talking about this, but I don't know.  Anthony and I and Jimmy here, we're trying to rebuild our radio careers, you know?  Yeah.  We're climbing back up to the top slowly, but surely.  That virus is spreading slowly across America. 
[00:59:30]  On this very new medium.  And we're very happy, and I'm having more fun on radio than I've ever had, and I've been  at this a long time.  Anthony's been at this a long time, and we were thinking during the commercial break that  we're depending a lot on a satellite that is just rocking about 1,000 miles an hour  above our heads, just making circles around the earth.  Or figure eights, I guess, right?  No, this one's kind of just hanging out right above the country.  Yeah.  They put it in an orbit that rotates the same speed as the earth, so it's constantly over 
[01:00:00]  the United States.  So does that mean that they have to use the brakes on the satellite?  No.  It's the orbit they put it in.  Orbit.  Explain that to me.  Like, don't you have to go against the...  No.  If you put a satellite at, I think it's 25,000 miles into orbit, it will stay over the same 
[01:00:30]  spot on the earth.  Without using any kind of motor or anything?  No.  Occasionally, they've got to kind of, you know, use those little retro rockets to kind of keep  it in position.  Give it a quick blast.  But, yeah.  All right.  But, you know, when it's at a certain altitude, it's as if it is falling constantly around the  earth.  But the centrifugal force of it moving at that speed makes it want to fly away from  the earth. 
[01:01:00]  And when those are in perfect balance, you have an orbit.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  People are really getting pissed off how smart you are, by the way.  I see on the message boards, they're challenging you.  Oh, those asses.  And they're trying to debunk you.  But it's not that I...  I'm not saying I know everything.  So you obviously can pose a question that I won't have a clue about.  Well, that's the brilliance that is you, Anthony.  You know a little bit about everything. 
[01:01:30]  So you could go to these cocktail parties and just...  Right there.  There you go.  You could give them what you just said.  And that's all you need.  That's all I need.  Because you're not going to take it to the next level with some kind of a...  What are they called?  Scientists or something?  I don't need to go into all the physics behind how a satellite is...  And if you happen to have that conversation at a cocktail party,  and then a NASA guy comes up to you and he wants to take it to the next level.  I'd be happy to hang out in the chat.  You're actually moving on to the next person with your... 
[01:02:00]  Actually, I would talk to the NASA guy, Opie.  You would?  Yeah.  That's all right.  But then I could, you know, mingle through the party,  overhear another group of conversing about something else.  Right.  And kind of go over there and, hey, here you go.  The phones have exploded, so I don't know what that means.  It might mean that you're wrong.  What?  I don't know.  We'll see what happens.  Steve in Jersey, what's up?  What's up, boys?  I got some Radio Gold going on in about a minute.  What is it?  It's the Scott and Todd Friday morning blast-off. 
[01:02:30]  What the hell is that?  They're welcome to the weekend celebration, boys.  Come on.  Hold on.  Eric knows exactly what that's about.  He's reaching for his headphones.  Wait, wait, wait.  Here it is.  Can you hear it?  Yelling.  Dedicated to Marisol.  Does that sound good?  Yeah.  Not really, well.  She's out of Inglewood, Clemson, New Jersey.  She works for InTouch Weekly.  She listens to us every morning. 
[01:03:00]  What's that, baby?  She's a publicist.  Yeah.  She's a publicist.  Yeah.  And if she's ready, we are a French-Pity-Lava Direct.  From the highest top man, we're a garden.  We are high in the sky.  The woman of the Joe Beloy, nearly famous, highly outrageous, but never ever contagious,  Scott and Todd.  Right there, on this weekend blast.  Oh, spectacular.  Oh, that's not much. 
[01:03:30]  Steve.  Steve.  Can someone else call with this audio in if you have a radio and you're on with these guys?  Yeah.  Steve.  Man, if you guys are going to do this, you know, holding the phone to the speaker thing,  you've got to be able to be in contact with us.  Because all this guy has to do is turn up the audio on his radio there, and we'd be in.  All right, we've got to give up on it. 
[01:04:00]  Steve.  Yeah.  Hey, Steve.  Oh, God.  Damn it.  Can't someone else call in with that?  God, you guys, you've got to be in contact with us.  All we have to do is make a few adjustments, and we're with the bit.  See, it might be a little uncomfortable, but when you first put the phone to the radio,  what you have to do is also kind of get your ear down there so you can hear what we're saying. 
[01:04:30]  Right.  Don't talk, but then if you hear us go, hey, dude, then you can hear and correct whatever we need you to correct.  We don't want to give up on the wacky radio bit.  It has major potential, but Steve.  Oh, God, that's so frustrating.  Where's Eric?  Because he could explain what they were doing.  Eric.  We're getting audio on the phone for you right now.  When I was over there, what they do is on 8 o'clock in the morning, they flush the format. 
[01:05:00]  Like, PLJ's not good enough, so they play all this other music from the 70s and Mojo stuff.  Hey, flush the format.  Big dramatic buildup to, like, the Back to the Future theme and a lot of different wacky sound effects.  And Scott puts on his big boss jock voice.  I want to do the bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  Remember that?  They do that, too.  They have these little bang on the drum remixes.  We had listeners call and for some reason they would just yell bang, bang, bang.  Oh, that was some dumb radio show.  And we started mocking them because their whole bit on Friday was to call up while bang on the drum was playing. 
[01:05:30]  And just yell bang.  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  And then they keep you on the phone and you've said enough bangs, but you know you're still live,  so you're like, bang, bang, bang, bang.  Do I still do it?  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  Just awful.  Absolutely awful.  Here's a little secret.  If your local show has a lot of production leading up to a bit, the bit stinks. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Absolutely just stinks.  Awful.  The more production they use, the worse the bit's going to be.  No, that's okay.  All right, we've got to move on to other things.  That's a bummer.  He messed up the whole bit.  Screwed it up.  Dave in Colorado.  What's up, Dave?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  I think I know what's causing all the interference with the XM radio.  Ben's faggy-ass shirts.  Can the color of a shirt actually interfere with the satellite? 
[01:06:30]  He wants to know if Ben's still wearing his umbrella.  Beach umbrella shirt.  Beach umbrella from yesterday.  Two old Jewish women lounging under him, sipping little fucking beverages.  Thanks, good improv.  Sipping beverages.  No shit, stupid.  All right.  Jimmy, you said you had a thought starter.  Oh!  I was just kind of like, I didn't know what else to say, so I kind of said that.  Oh, and then you didn't really have anything.  No, but I figured that you guys would pick up the slack.  That's a good idea. 
[01:07:00]  I didn't know what to say.  All right.  So we had nothing, Opie.  Oh, look at Katie Couric.  Acting like she cares.  Oh, what are they doing today?  Hey, they're on top of the Empire State Building?  Well, with the kid that has some kind of brain surgery.  Oh, Jesus.  So they're giving the kid a nice day in New York City, and there's Katie Couric looking  like she cares.  And then, of course, tomorrow she'll forget their names.  Yeah.  Oh, what happened to the poor kid?  He's got a big stitch across his head.  Yeah, he had some serious surgery.  That's for sure.  Oh, look at my hot dog.  I guess Katie's showing him a day in New York City. 
[01:07:30]  Walking him around town.  That's nice.  And then the kid's going to think that he has a new friend, and he'll start calling Katie  at the Today Show, and she'll just be hitting delete on her voicemail.  He'll write her a letter.  She'll never get to it.  Yeah, she'll never get to it.  Right back.  Oh, look, they're taking a helicopter tour.  Over Yankee Stadium.  Over Last Place Stadium.  Today in New York.  Bastards.  Aw, that'll get their ratings up.  Sure.  All right, and then they go home, never to be heard from Katie again. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, they're at ground zero for a somber moment.  Build the buildings back.  I can't stand this stupid Freedom Tower.  It's awful.  Yeah, that's the huge story in New York.  They pretty much scrapped the Freedom Tower.  Because of security issues.  So now they need a new design, I guess.  It's going to be another year or two before they figure that out, I think.  I think people are really starting to want two buildings there like they used to be.  People are really starting to push for that.  Put the goddamn things back. 
[01:08:30]  When they said the Freedom Tower to begin with, I was just like, ugh, that's so just hokey.  Freedom and Liberty.  We'll put the Liberty Lobby and the Freedom Tower.  Enough with just naming it something.  It'll make everything all better.  Just put the goddamn towers back up.  They put the Liberty International Airport.  That was Newark Airport.  Yeah.  Liberty.  Who calls it that?  Liberty.  Nobody.  I'm going to Newark.  Yeah, let's go to Newark.  Ugh, I've got to go to Newark.  It makes everything better.  Yeah.  It shows you that they didn't win by calling it the Freedom Tower. 
[01:09:00]  It shows you that they did win if you've got to make some pathetic name.  Yeah.  Put the buildings back.  And you don't put the buildings back the way they were.  You put something else but say that it's better this way.  It's not.  You know, look, we're showing that we're overcoming.  No, we're not.  You're showing that you're bowing down in fear that they're going to do it again.  What you do is you put the buildings back and then you make sure it doesn't happen again  by having this extraordinary security.  And it's not about any of those things. 
[01:09:30]  It's about that's very valuable real estate down there.  And eventually they're going to build something there and people are going to go back to work.  That's what happens.  There you go.  It's not about freedom and showing them that they didn't win.  And for those of you out there wondering, like, I'm complaining the tower should be back.  Would I work on the 100th floor?  No.  No.  I wouldn't.  But you wouldn't be a firefighter either.  No.  But there are people that would and are.  I just feel comfortable talking shit in the safety of the 5th floor studio.  Exactly. 
[01:10:00]  All right.  Why don't we move on to some things?  Steve, you killed us today, man.  You took some of the energy out of the show.  And that bit could have worked.  Oh.  No.  Don't let Steve get to you.  No, no.  It's all right.  It's all right.  We'll move on.  We'll regroup here.  We've got to talk about the bad Santa on Long Island.  Have you heard this story, Anthony?  Long Island just raises nuts.  Kooks.  Kooks.  Joel Rifkin was a great one.  Remember him?  He was caught driving down the road with a dead hooker in the back of his pickup truck.  Yep.  And apparently that was the last in a line of dead hookers. 
[01:10:30]  He was a serial killer.  Yeah.  Got him.  You have the Long Island Railroad gunman, Colin Ferguson, who just went on the railroad,  had had it with white people, and just started shooting them in their seats.  He was a good one.  Amy Fisher, of course, shot Joey Butterfuoco's wife, Mary Jo, in the head.  On the front door there, steps there, sorry.  Long Island has a great history. 
[01:11:00]  What about the guy that had the dungeon?  Oh, little Katie Beers.  Katie Beers.  That was a great story, too.  He took a little Katie Beers and kidnapped her from some skating rink and put her in this  underground bunker that he built in his backyard out of plywood and buried it.  And he had the sick thing, one of the sick things, he had a TV camera in his house  and a TV downstairs in the bunker that she could watch.  So she saw the police coming over this guy's house. 
[01:11:30]  She was able to watch it as she's being held prisoner and yelling, please help me.  And she watched the cops come, talk to them, and leave.  That isn't, like, torturous.  That was John Esposito, by the way.  John Esposito.  Over in Bayshore.  In Bayshore.  Beautiful Bayshore, Long Island.  How long did he have her for?  Ooh, how long?  We got that story up there?  I remember the story.  Held her captive for 17 days.  Oh, okay.  I thought it was, like, a year's ago.  No, 17 days.  Nah, that's a cakewalk.  No, I mean, I've... 
[01:12:00]  17 days.  Where's little Katie Beers?  Book her for the show.  How old is she now?  What year was that?  That was, like, 92, I think, or 93.  It was the end of 92, Anthony.  Do some math.  Was he sexually abusing her, or did he just want a kid?  It kind of never...  I don't think it got to, like, where he was having sex with her, but he would...  I think he was trying to make her his girlfriend.  Like, be nice to her and stuff.  How old was she?  How old was she?  You're not helping.  It's not written there? 
[01:12:30]  I'm looking, Anthony, for you.  I'm looking.  There's a whole story.  I don't see an age.  But it was 13 years...  12 years ago, this past January.  I would say 8, maybe.  Something like that.  How old is he?  12.  She was 12.  12?  All right.  She's now 24 years old, Anthony.  Jesus.  24 years old.  Little 12-year-old Katie Beers held captive.  That's another Long Island kook.  Hold on one second, Anthony.  We're going to try to bring the bit back here.  Uh-oh.  Charchy or something like that? 
[01:13:00]  What's your name, bro?  Me?  Yeah, what's your name?  Oh, this is Charchy.  Chark.  Hey!  And there go all the phones.  We got the gremlins today, boys and girls.  The phones exploded.  They just completely exploded.  We had...  Oh, my...  Hey, hey, no, no, no, no!  Oh.  Just let's roll.  Well, Katie Beers reminded me of a story in California anyway  about a girl named Colleen Stan.  She's an adult.  She was kidnapped by this guy, Cameron, and his wife 
[01:13:30]  and held captive for seven years.  Seven years.  And they built a coffin under their bed.  I mean, they both sexually abused her and raped her  and they made her sleep.  And it's a claustrophobic nightmare  in a coffin under their bed.  They had, like, air holes in the foot of the coffin.  I believe she was chained in the coffin.  Wow.  And then they built an underground thing like that.  They had an underground bunker  and they kept her for seven years?  Seven years.  Eventually, they let her go out to work.  He blackmailed her into thinking  he brought her in a white slavery ring. 
[01:14:00]  And after years of this,  he believed that her family would be killed.  She really thought her family...  He actually let her go home and see her family one time  and she came back.  Now, see, I don't buy that.  Oh, they said that she was made nuts.  And the only reason she ever realized it was bullshit  is because the wife,  when he started building extra shackles in this bunker,  he wanted to have, like, a harem of slaves.  Uh-huh.  I think the wife freaked out  and told the girl, Colleen,  we never...  There is no white slavery...  There's no slavery ring.  Your family's not in danger or whatever.  You're not... 
[01:14:30]  And then she went and told the cops.  But she actually was home.  She visited her parents  and didn't say,  holy shit, I'm being held captive.  She went back.  She went back?  That's wacky.  Well, he let her at one point.  He used to chain her in the bathroom  and then one of his kids found her  so then they made her sleep in the coffin again.  It's a claustrophobic nightmare.  Colleen Stan, look her up.  I forget the name of the book,  but it's probably the worst thing I've ever read.  That's a little odd,  like that other girl  that was out in, um...  Where the hell was she? 
[01:15:00]  That, uh, Smart?  Oh, uh, yeah, yeah.  Elizabeth Smart.  Elizabeth Smart.  And she was kidnapped from her house  and then certain situations happen where...  She can go home at any time.  Yeah, there's...  Or call somebody or said something.  Opportunities where you're in public  with these people,  you're dressed all weird,  you're face covered,  you're not telling people who you are,  and you're passing police and everything.  And you don't go up and tell them.  There's some weird little thing going on in there.  You just think that everybody's in on it.  Like, this girl, Colleen,  thought the cops were in on it. 
[01:15:30]  They had protections in the police department.  She thought anywhere she went,  they would bring her back.  You know, like one of those awful B-movie horror films.  Yeah.  Wow, that's weird.  Trust the sheriff.  Like in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the remake.  Yeah.  You go to the early army of the cop  and he brings you right back.  In on it.  Yeah.  That was a great movie.  I like that remake.  He kind of took me out of it, though,  as much as I love him.  Yeah, yeah, because it's, you know...  Sergeant Hartman.  Sergeant Hartman.  Let's go back to Sharsi,  or whatever her name was.  Sharsi.  Sharsi.  Sharsi.  Yeah.  That is a hard name to say, man. 
[01:16:00]  Let's go get some Sharsi.  Sharsi.  Joni loves Sharsi.  Sharsi with a C on the end.  Your name is awful.  Sharsi.  I know.  It's terrible, but hey,  what can you do about your name?  What kind of name is that?  I don't care.  It was great.  I was a nickname from Charlotte.  Really?  No, it's not...  Yeah.  My mom knew somebody who had an aunt named Charlotte,  or Charlotte that was nicknamed Sharsi.  Charlotte's like a pretty name, though.  Why would you change it?  Yeah, I think you need to go back to the nickname book. 
[01:16:30]  If your name was Hildy or Gertie...  It's not Charlotte.  It's Sharsi, so...  It stinks.  Go to Charlotte.  It's not that bad.  What's up, Sharsi?  You have a nice name.  Well, I have a radio station here up by Beloit, Wisconsin,  that's doing a bit on Joe the Janitor.  You have to call in and guess what he was humming.  And he hung for like a minute and a half,  and it was terrible.  I mean, it sounds like some old black man on a porch somewhere humming.  I don't know what.  Joe the Janitor hums, 
[01:17:00]  and you have to guess what song he's humming.  What a fantastic radio bit.  Damn it, steal that one.  Can I say...  I hope that he's in a hospital bed humming Philadelphia.  Well, it's a country station.  They went to a country song,  and now they're on commercials.  So they haven't had anybody call in to guess what he was humming yet.  Oh, that could be exciting.  They might just play the humming again,  because that's what you do.  You play the humming, and then you go right to the calls. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, they might have been...  That's not what it was.  There was a girl who...  Okay.  Jim the Janitor.  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  All right, we're going to try something here, Sharsi.  Sharsi.  I cannot even say your name.  You're killing me today.  Sharsi.  We're going to just keep you in the background. 
[01:18:00]  So you just be quiet.  Listen to the program.  If they come back, you just interrupt us, okay?  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Nick from Wisconsin is saying Joe the Janitor has an album.  He actually has an album out there somewhere you could buy.  We need some Joe the Janitor.  All right.  All right.  You just stay there, and let us know if they're going back to the bit.  All right.  Anthony, so we got another kook on Long Island.  Well, Seizure Man is saying, didn't Long Island raise a psycho that kicked a dog in the liver?  I think that guy was from Long Island.  And, of course, you can't forget the Amityville Horror. 
[01:18:30]  The Lutzes.  The Lutzes.  There you go.  Yeah, one of the kids.  Actually, wasn't it the DeFeos?  Ronnie DeFeo, yeah.  Yeah, he was on that actually killed his family.  That's kind of Long Island kook story right there.  I saw one of the kids on TV.  He's talking for the first time because the new movie's out.  They've refused interviews all these years, and now the kid is, I don't know, upper 30s or something like that.  I saw this.  This was a kid, though, that moved into the house after the murders, but before the Lutzes moved in. 
[01:19:00]  Oh.  So he was in there before the family that actually inspired the Amityville Horror story.  Oh, no kidding.  Yeah.  And he's coming forward saying that he saw some weird things in there.  And then he's claiming it's not the house.  It was his stepfather or something that did some of that devil worshiping and said something like,  if you call the devil, he's going to show you a thing or two.  He'll show up.  Yeah.  I bet you he has a book, too.  He probably does.  He probably does. 
[01:19:30]  I bet he's promoting a book.  All right.  Here's the latest kook on Long Island.  And I think then after this, Anthony, I think we need to expand a bit.  You know how we do that cute little neighborhood news thing?  Of course.  What's happening in your town?  What's happening in your town?  I think what we'll do today is what's happening in your town.  But you have to call us with some of the kooks that you remember from your town.  The kooks from your town, from the news, yeah.  Because I think we've had quite a run, Long Island.  And I don't think you guys can beat us around the country there.  Oh, Fred from Jonestown's on the line.  And we're not taking any calls from Chicago, because we want to beat out Chicago today. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Santa likes to slay critters.  This guy is a kook.  A Long Island bad Santa has been busted for allegedly trapping animals in his yard, then  torturing and killing them, Anthony.  Nice.  William Thomas, 76, a Baylor place in East Northport, is accused of being a serial killer  of birds, rabbits, squirrels, and raccoons.  This is how Dahmer started, right?  Yeah, but most of them do.  Not at 70-whatever.  Not at 76 years old. 
[01:20:30]  I think they better check this guy's basement.  Well, Dahmer started as a kid doing that stuff, right?  And then moved on to Filipino boys.  Drilling little holes in their skulls.  The Loatian fella?  Oh, my God.  He drilled a hole in his head.  While he was alive?  Yeah, because he was all drugged out.  And Jeffrey Dahmer took a hand drill with a tiny little drill bit and drilled a hole  in his head right into his brain.  And the kid wakes up, and he's got this splitting headache, triple vision, and he's trying to 
[01:21:00]  get out of the place because he's got a hole in his head.  What a sick bastard.  You know when you drill into wood or plastic with a drill?  Do you think, like, little shards of brain came twisting out of the drill bit and skull?  And then the poor boy stumbles out and can't get the food order right and has to call in.  Yeah.  And that's kind of horrific because didn't he go to the cops and the cops brought him back? 
[01:21:30]  They thought it was a lover's quarrel.  The cops gave the kid back.  So that's a story where it did happen like that.  He goes to the cops, asks for help.  Dahmer tells the cops that it's just a lover's spat.  And they leave him back with this guy that then kills him.  He ran out naked.  And that kid's family sued the, I think it was Milwaukee, or Wisconsin somewhere, the police department.  Imagine that.  You're like, oh, my God, there's a chance I might get out of this because the cops are here  and everything's going to be fine.  Okay.  Well, why don't you take him? 
[01:22:00]  And we don't want to see this out on the street anymore.  Okay, officer.  I'll tell you, that's an awkward walk back up the apartment steps.  Ryan, I was kidding.  I really didn't want the police to help me.  All right, so, yeah, he's killing the birds, the rabbits, squirrels, raccoons.  After a raid by cops in the SPCA, Thomas, who has a long white beard and likes to wear black boots and a red coat, Anthony,  was taken to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation.  Maybe he didn't like them tweeting in the morning or something, one officer said. 
[01:22:30]  The neighbors kind of tipped the cops off to this thing.  They'd all been talking about it, all the neighbors.  They knew this guy was a kook, but there was really nothing they could do about it.  So one of the neighbors took out the old handy video camera and videotaped him taking birds out of this trap or a cage or something  because he would capture these animals.  And I guess whenever he felt like it, he'd kill them.  So they have a video of him taking numerous birds out of the cage, laying them on the ground, 
[01:23:00]  and squishing their little skulls with his boots.  Oh, my gosh.  So they took the video to the cops, and he was arrested.  Right.  And by the way, there are, I forget what they're called, squish videos.  Yeah.  There was a thing online a while ago where women in these high-heeled shoes would squish animals with their heels,  and guys would jack off watching this.  Okay, I can't even see where there is a bit of sexual or anything you would want there while you're jacking. 
[01:23:30]  It's got to be the death of the animal or the power of the female shoe or the woman.  It's some really sick submission.  But, I mean, it was a big thing.  I never saw one.  Any type of animal cruelty is a sick thing anyway.  But how could you jack off to that?  Yeah.  People think I'm a silly goose, because I like a log on the chest, but it just straightens you right out.  No one gets hurt, and you certainly don't want to squish it.  Nice clean-up messier.  Elbow to the ribs.  Ah, Char Shea.  Yeah. 
[01:24:00]  What's going on?  This is really hard to listen to two radio shows at once, you know.  All right.  Well, you want to give up on this?  I mean, you gave us the bid, I guess.  Well, I think I accidentally lost the station, but now I have one that's doing Derby Horse or not.  They're giving a name, and you have to call in and guess whether it's a Derby Horse or not.  Or if it's a fake name that Dave Funny made up at the radio thing?  Derby Horse or not.  Oh, my God.  Boy, but they're pumping the bits out.  You've got to give them credit.  The woman that won, you know, her question was Sally Sunshine. 
[01:24:30]  Was that a Derby Horse or not?  And she goes, no, it was not.  Really?  How about Harry Hackbit?  Or fucking Willie One Market.  Yuck.  Wow, that's awful.  People reminding us Long Island also had the devil-worshipping killing in Northport.  Oh, yeah.  Remember that one?  And then there was the other one in Northport.  Northport and East Northport just raising some real animals where some guy strangled a teen on her front lawn 
[01:25:00]  and left her kind of under a tree on her front lawn.  That was about a block down from my grandma's house.  So every time I go to grandma's house for Thanksgiving, I look at the lawn and go, ah, that's where the dead chick was.  You have a better story, though.  Let me say goodbye to Char-Chi before I set you up.  Who?  Char-Chi.  Char-Chi.  Char-Chi.  I told her.  I can't say her name.  I'm not saying Char-Chi.  Char-Chi.  It's not that hard.  Three-year-olds say my name really easily, but adults always seem to have trouble with it.  Char-Chi.  I have problems with S's.  Char-Chi.  Char-Chi. 
[01:25:30]  Char-Chi.  Char-Chi.  Char-Chi.  Char-Chi.  It's kind of like Char-Chi with an S.  Like, did they call you Char-Chi?  Hey, Char-Chi.  Oh, I've had a million nicknames from it, yeah.  Char, Cha-Chi.  Call me whatever you want, but just don't call me late for dinner.  All right, we've got to let you go.  Oh.  We've got to let you.  We've got to let you be.  Yeah, then tell us we've got to get you out of here, Char-Chi.  Okay.  Don't let us. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, no one came in here.  Shut up.  Don't wreck the bed, man.  I have a suggestion, though, for you guys.  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  I know a long time ago you talked about maybe going on the road in a truck.  Yeah, they're still talking about this O&A road trip thing.  Yeah.  Well, I'm a truck driver, and I think you guys should come with me.  You are.  Oh, hey.  Oh, now you're talking.  What's your handle, Charcy?  My handle is Little Shark.  Little Shark?  Little Shark?  Yeah. 
[01:26:30]  All right, so you're a small trucker, I guess, huh?  Well, yeah, I guess I'm little.  Uh-oh.  Really?  I'm little.  No, I am.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  We heard the hesitation.  We've been at this game a long time, Charcy.  You're short, but you're not little, right?  No, I am little.  I'm very little.  All right, but there's definitely a problem.  Well, you know what?  We all have some kind of problem with our bodies.  Where's the problem, Harry?  Where's the problem?  Listen, I sent Danny a picture of me last week because I called about something. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, Danny.  Danny holding out.  Danny keeping your picture for himself, it looks like.  It's probably not the greatest picture, but.  Come here, Danny.  Anyway, he asked me what I looked like, and I told him, and he didn't believe me.  So I told him.  Why is Danny asking you what the fuck?  Motherfucker.  Hold on, Charcy.  Why are you asking the callers what they look like if they're on the field of persuasion?  What do you think you are, Jimmy Norton?  Yeah.  Because I think what had happened was I was trying to persuade her to do some guess what's 
[01:27:30]  in my pants, and I know how you guys like pictures, so she sent a picture to my email.  Never got to play, but.  Why didn't you share it with us?  So you're persuading her without ever telling us that that was your plan or anything else.  You really just tried to make it about the show.  I know.  I was trying to see if she could give us some radio.  Yeah, I'm trying to help out the show.  I wasn't going to tell you about it.  You have the picture?  Yeah, it's in my email.  Oh, print that out.  Let's see.  What does she look like?  She's on the phone right now.  Average blonde girl.  Yeah.  I'm not really that photogenic, but it's a picture. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, you know, I'm not that photogenic either.  I'm not.  Really.  It's true.  It's off a camera phone, so the quality isn't that.  Camera phone.  Danny was doing it for the show.  That's why I like this game.  Yeah, okay, Danny.  He's a go-getter.  I had her call up, and I jerked off at home and asked her what she looked like just for  the show to hear her voice.  So, Regen.  If the voice had the right tone for the boys.  Oh, yeah.  Only if they would like it on the show.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, thank you, Danny.  Well, good thing we found out, because now we can thank you for helping the show out like 
[01:28:30]  that.  Thanks a lot, Danny.  Jesus.  Good kid.  Thanks for that sacrifice.  All right, Sharksy.  Sacrifice.  We're going to stop paying that kid, bastard.  Yeah, we're trying to figure out this whole O&A road trip thing.  We might turn into some kind of O&A fan appreciation thing and go across the country and, I don't  know, maybe do an impromptu comedy show at a truck stop.  Just get it all crazy out there on the road.  Yeah, act like Pickle Park Pete's, whatever the fuck they're called.  I don't know.  Pickle Park Pete's.  I thought they would love it.  All right.  Is that what they're called? 
[01:29:00]  Thank you, Sharksy.  Okay, you're welcome.  Bye, Sharksy.  There goes Sharksy.  Sharksy.  It could be cool if we do this road trip thing.  I mean, they want to start us in Seattle and slowly make our way back to New York.  And it would be cool if, like, all of a sudden people just started following, you know, the  broadcast buses and stuff.  Annoying people following us.  It would be a major convoy.  A major wreck.  All right.  Remember that Don Rickles show, CPO, Sharksy?  Oh, wow.  You are going back. 
[01:29:30]  I'm old.  Anthony, we're ready to span America now.  Oh.  We're going to do a little version of what's happening in your town.  What's happening in your town.  Usually we go for the headline of the day, but today we're going to find out if there's  more kooks in America like there are in the Long Island area.  Long Island.  We got that kook that was stepping on animals' heads.  It's our story today.  That's what's in our news.  All right.  Let's hit that there, Eric.  Hawk?  The boss wants something.  Wow, we have gremlins today. 
[01:30:00]  Eric can't work under pressure.  No, it's not even his fault.  The screen is just blinking on and off.  I like to just blame Eric.  Eric, fix it.  All right.  Hit it.  From flipper babies to flipped over school buses.  From kidnappings to kids drowning.  There are heartwarming stories all over this great land.  It's time to tell the world what's happening in your town.  All right.  Let's start with Danny in Indiana.  Steve came up with that bed.  Jesus, Steve.  I was wondering if you could get a dead kid into the promo. 
[01:30:30]  Some of the promos for me.  You're insane.  Danny, what's up?  Well, about, oh, I guess it's been about a year now.  There was a guy over here in Indiana that took a chicken to a hotel, cut its beak off,  fucked its brains out, and killed it, and then told the cops that he didn't do it.  So in Indiana, there's men cutting the feet off and fucking chickens.  Yeah.  No, did he cut the feet or the beak off?  The beak.  Oh, the beak?  I thought he said the feet.  Nah, the beak.  That's a smarter move because the beak, those little fellas will turn around and poke you 
[01:31:00]  in the thighs.  I thought the story sounded a little weird with cutting the feet off.  You know, now it makes sense.  I don't understand how you fuck a healthy chicken, but how do you fuck one squawking  with no beak, like there's blood all over your sheets?  Bloody chicken head.  And you know it's not taking it quietly.  His little feet are kicking at you.  I saw a video once of a German guy having sex with a chicken.  Yes.  Oh, I've seen that.  And he's going, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.  And the chicken is going like, oh, yeah. 
[01:31:30]  That almost sounded like Terry Schiavo.  It was just these long, like, oh, I'm being fucked.  Oh, I'm a chicken and he's fucking dead.  Yeah, it's like, oh, it's not bad enough.  My life is a chicken.  Yeah, I'm a chicken.  I'm a chicken in this life.  I could have been any life for him.  And good old God gave me the chicken body.  And this Nazi is just pumping away going, yeah, yeah, yeah.  How do you keep a rod through that? 
[01:32:00]  How do you not?  Very cute chicken.  Good point, Ant.  Not like it was an ugly chicken.  That's true.  He's not a faggot.  It was a hen.  Danny, what happened to that guy?  I think he's at a mental hospital now, but I wouldn't swear to it.  It kind of got lost along with all the other murders going on in Gary.  Yeah.  All right.  She's hot, Charcy.  Guys, have a good day.  All right.  Charcy's cute.  Yeah, that's a pretty picture.  Give it a thumbs up for Charcy.  Because it's from a camera phone. 
[01:32:30]  In this picture, yeah, she kind of.  She says she's not photogenic.  She's photogenic.  All right.  She's not bad at all.  She looks like somebody.  Can't figure it out.  Linda Blair?  It's a little like.  Let me see.  Paula Abdul.  Abdul.  Figure it out.  She looks like that actress.  Yeah, that actress.  That one.  From kidnappings to kid drowning.  Steve is the worst.  Jesus.  I just wanted to say to do a kidnich.  All right.  Let's try another one here. 
[01:33:00]  Matt in Jersey.  Matt.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, do you guys remember in Westfield, New Jersey, John List?  Yes.  He killed his whole family.  And then he moved out.  He burned the house and then moved down to Virginia.  Started a new family.  And then 17 years later, was caught by the police.  Was it America's Most Wanted that caught him?  Oh, yeah.  It was.  They made that bust of him that how he would look nowadays.  Oh, yeah.  And they nailed it.  And all of a sudden, somebody saw that and went, oh, my God.  He was at the grocery store last week. 
[01:33:30]  I know this guy.  That kind of sucks, man.  I mean, that's got to be worse than getting caught right away.  You think you're finally in the clear.  Think you're in the clear.  17 years later, a whole new life.  They come up with this new science that just hangs your ass.  How do we not have calls from California?  How do we not have calls from Atlanta or Chicago or Wisconsin?  All right.  Let's go to Pete.  Pete, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up, man?  You guys fucking rock. 
[01:34:00]  I just want to tell you.  Oh, thank you.  A few years ago, I was coming home from school one day.  And I saw a whole bunch of helicopters.  The choppers, like News 4, Channel 7.  What happened was there was a serial killer here, and he had murdered eight hookers and had stored them up in his house where he lived with his parents.  And he had them stored up in the attic, soaked in bleach, and, like, the house would reek.  So what happened was when all these choppers were here, I knew a couple of the city of Poughkeepsie cops. 
[01:34:30]  And what happened was, like, when they were taking out the bodies, I was standing right there.  There was a whole crowd.  But once the door opened, everybody started gagging and almost threw up.  It was like, it was in the papers, all over the place.  The guy's name was Kendall Francois.  But now, did he get arrested, or was there other litigation?  Yeah, he had gotten arrested at that point.  How much time did he get?  He's got money.  Do you know if he had a lawyer? 
[01:35:00]  I don't think he had a lawyer, man.  I think he's done.  He had eight hookers thrown up there.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  Thank you.  No problem, man.  Take care, guys.  We've got to break into this fine bit because there's a guy in the line claiming that he lives in the house that Anthony paid for.  We were talking about this earlier in the show.  Steve and Huntington.  What's up, Steve?  Yeah, how are you doing today?  Hey, good, man.  Hey, Tony.  I just want to thank you for the lovely place I live in there in Huntington with Wendy.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  You live...  I love the program.  You what? 
[01:35:30]  I love the program.  I appreciate the money and everything you're making to pay for my place.  No, do you really live there?  Yeah, man.  How does that work?  You know, pretty good.  Works out pretty good.  No, I mean, are you renting a room, or are you her boyfriend?  Yeah, I'm living there.  You're living there.  You rent a room?  No, uh-oh.  Why are you being so mysterious?  It doesn't...  Because you have to be, you know.  You don't want to get the lawyers involved.  Dude, I don't care.  It doesn't care.  I really don't care.  I just want to hear how the house is. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, the house is beautiful.  You don't have to come out anytime you want to have dinner.  Bring your girlfriend with you.  Are you just being an ass?  He's lying.  Yeah, he's lying.  Punch it out.  I was hoping it was.  I want to hear how my house is.  That would have been some good radio right there.  I want to hear what it's like.  Because I do recall, like, in the house before she bought the house she has now, the one she  was living in, that I actually got thrown out of, that one, I know there were people that 
[01:36:30]  were renting rooms in there.  So I thought maybe it was a guy like that that was renting a room.  I'd love to hear some of the horror stories.  Hey, it's nice.  Did she wake you up when she falls in the house?  Falls in the front door?  Should we go back to the bit?  Sure.  All right, we've got to replay the intro there.  Hit that intro again there.  From flipper babies to flipped over school buses.  From kidnappings to kids drowning.  There are heartwarming stories all over this great land.  It's time to tell the world what's happening in your town. 
[01:37:00]  All right, let's go to Baltimore and say hi to Kurt.  Kurt, what's up?  Hey, guys, it's Kurt.  This guy stole a car in Baltimore, and the cops recovered it and towed it away.  And then what happened, I guess, is he forgot his wallet in the car, and he reported it stolen,  and he was arrested, of course.  Wait, was that in Baltimore?  Yes, it was.  He steals the car?  Yep, stole the car. 
[01:37:30]  The cops found it, recovered it, towed it away.  He came out, saw that his new car that he acquired, I guess, was gone, so he reported it stolen.  Oh, he reported the stolen car stolen.  What an idiot.  What an idiot, exactly.  Anyway, punch it out.  No one's dead, though, in that one.  Yeah.  There wasn't much tragedy in that one.  Well, which one do you want to go to?  Let's start with Nick in Wisconsin.  Nick, what's up?  Well, the coroner in Rock County, Wisconsin, was arrested on drug and theft charges. 
[01:38:00]  She was stealing drugs from the dead.  Stealing what?  Drugs from the dead?  She was stealing pain medication from dead people.  Pain medication.  How do you do that?  It just happens to be in their pockets or something?  She pocketed them from the scenes.  Oh, from the scenes.  Oh, okay.  So she goes over there to pick up the dead body, and then she's going to, wow, that's  not a bad gig, if you think about it.  Yeah, you know, where she'd, like, cash money, too, that was, like, sent to the coroner's 
[01:38:30]  office, but it would be written in her name, and then she'd just cash it and keep the money.  Can you imagine?  That's not a bad gig.  If you're into, you know, drugs and stuff, and you happen to be a coroner, you have to  go to these houses.  No one else is in the house.  Go through their medicine cabinet.  Who's going to miss a few pills from the medicine cabinet?  They're not going to need them.  Wow.  In 1963, she was wondering how this is going to affect her job.  Right.  I don't know.  I'm like, you fucking dolt.  Yeah, you really are.  Punch out, buddy.  Yeah, I'm out. 
[01:39:00]  All right.  Let's go to Joe in New Jersey.  Joe?  Yeah, how's it going, guys?  What's up?  Hey, there's this radio guy in New York where every time he gets a thought or idea, it  gets stolen.  It's really bizarre.  Wow, that sounds strange.  Yeah, I hear you.  Dude, every time he gets an idea, it just gets stolen out of his head.  Yeah, it's amazing.  Wow, that is amazing.  I'd hate to be that guy. 
[01:39:30]  Shake it up.  All right.  All right.  Very good.  Well, that wasn't what I wanted to play.  All right.  Well, there you go.  I guess that's enough.  Now, here's one more.  We'll go to Delaware.  We'll end with Joe in Delaware.  Joe?  Yeah, hi.  How you doing?  Hey, Joe.  Yeah, we got Tom Capano here in Delaware.  He's a guy who killed his secretary, stuffed her in a cooler, and took her out in the water,  tried to sink her.  But the cooler didn't sink, so his brother pumped some shots into it, and it still wouldn't 
[01:40:00]  sink, so they took it out, chained her up, and just let her go.  And how did they find the secretary in the cooler?  I think his brother squealed.  Ah, brother.  Wow.  What an ass.  They chained what up and let it go?  They chained up her body and let it go.  Still in the cooler?  No, into the water.  The cooler wouldn't sink.  Oh, all right. 
[01:40:30]  They bailed on the cooler, just chained up the body, and that sunk it.  Yeah.  All right.  Why did he kill her?  I don't know.  Probably the normal affair stuff.  It seems to me the only real way to do it, if you want to sink something like that, is  to put it in a block of cement.  After you do your murder, you've got to take the body.  Put it in, just encase it in concrete, and then throw it in the water.  That way, nothing's floating to the top. 
[01:41:00]  None of that pesky evidence.  Yeah, but then you need a couple buddies to help you with the block of cement.  No, you've got to do it all alone, somehow.  Too many people around.  But then, you know, you're found buying cement.  They find out, what did you need all that cement for?  There's no way around it.  What do you do, then?  You can't go off Modesto in a rowboat and throw her over.  That pesky little kid comes out.  You drop one in, and two come out.  What do you do? 
[01:41:30]  How do you get rid of it?  What do you do?  I think the woodchipper.  Well, the woodchipper doesn't even work, because there was a story where a guy woodchippered his  wife, and they found a piece of her nail bed, a piece of the flesh under a fingernail, and  they did testing on it, and boom, he was busted.  That's all they found?  That's all they found on the shoreline.  He went down to a lake, and took the woodchipper by the lake, and chipped her, and let her pieces  fly into the lake. 
[01:42:00]  Wow!  Which is, you know, pretty damn good idea.  Yeah, and one little piece of her flesh.  They did testing on it, and everything.  Come on.  Are you serious?  I swear to you.  That's the story.  One little piece of flesh.  What are you thinking when you put your, someone you've been fucking.  Oh my God.  You're putting their leg in a woodchipper.  That's gotta be kinda creepy.  You have to go somewhere else, I think.  I don't think you could go, wow, I'm woodchipping my ex-loved one.  You gotta be like, la la la, this is not a woodchipper, I am not chipping somebody. 
[01:42:30]  There have to be some happy memories.  Maybe that one moment at the meeting where she wiped cake on your face.  And that flashes in your head as you're putting an arm in there.  That was kinda funny.  You saved the tits for last, cause they were your favorite part.  Oh God.  Jesus.  Yeah, and there has to be a part where it's like, oh look, I'm putting the pussy in.  Like, you know each part, and that part's gotta be like, oh, I'm putting the, oh, here it  goes. 
[01:43:00]  Are you puking?  Yeah, you gotta be just puking.  I don't care if you're a psychopath.  What kind of drugs do you have to take before you're able to even do that?  Oh my God, just a thought, even.  What do you do if someone walks up on you?  How do you explain a foot sticking out of the old woodchipper?  Mm-hmm.  It's not what it looks like.  That, uh, that's a Fargo scene right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Alright, we're gonna break.  I don't know what you do with somebody, though.  You gotta throw them in the ocean.  You put gas all over them, in their mouth, and anywhere there might be DNA evidence, and 
[01:43:30]  you light them on fire.  Yeah.  You destroy any type of fiber evidence.  I don't know.  I'm speculating.  Then you're, ah, gas station with their cameras.  What are you doing buying your can of gas?  Damn gas station with their cameras.  Maybe a cypher out of your tank?  Sure.  Do something like that?  Yeah.  Then what do you do with the burnt-up bones?  You can't get a fire going that hot where it's gonna burn up the bones.  They need, like, a crematorium for that.  No, no, well, they're gonna know who it is, but I'm just saying any evidence of what you  did will probably be burned away. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, but if they find out who it is, no, you gotta get rid of it completely.  Oh.  Let's say you offed your wife like that.  Now, you're gonna be the prime suspect regardless, so you gotta make sure nothing shows up.  Just put them behind the couch.  Like, if they didn't find those bodies, Peterson would have gotten off the hook, I think.  I agree.  They didn't have bodies.  Alright, guys.  I don't know.  Chop her up and put little, yeah, it's tough.  I don't know.  Guys?  Oh, yeah.  Gotta break in, because after the break.  Yeah.  We got clips from America's Funniest Mom. 
[01:44:30]  Stop it.  Oh.  I've heard about this contest that's sweeping the nation.  Oh, my God.  They have been trying to find the funniest mom in America, and I think we got the winner  and everything.  Oh, come on.  And clips.  This was on what channel?  Lifetime.  America's Funniest Mom.  So we'll do that after the break.  It's, you know, Mother's Day Sunday, so we're gonna do some cute Mother's Day.  What a teaser.  Yeah.  Theme radio bits.  Ugh.  Hi, Ben.  Hi, Jim. 
[01:45:00]  Wait, this guy, was that story in Pennsylvania, Anthony?  Yeah, I think it was.  The wood chipper?  Yeah.  Jim in Pennsylvania, what's up?  Yo, what's going on?  Hey.  That lake was in Connecticut, man.  Oh, Connecticut.  Okay.  Yeah, somebody's saying it was in Connecticut.  Yeah, Newtown, Connecticut.  I live on that lake.  Really?  Guy rolled the wood chipper, rented it, rolled it down, chipped her up.  They found a tooth on the shore.  Oh, it was a tooth?  Yeah, a cop actually drove by and saw him with a chipper.  I heard it was a fingernail.  But thought he was broke down.  I'm still going with my fingernail thumb thing. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  It could have been a fingernail, but it was a tooth.  But how did they know to even look there?  Because there was some, apparently a utility worker was out there at 3 in the morning and  noticed it, and then when the woman was missing, and they found out this guy rented a chipper,  he called it in.  Oh, somebody will always see.  How'd the guy clean out the wood chipper?  How do you not have any DNA evidence left in a wood chipper?  Well, it was before DNA.  This was probably 12, 13 years ago.  Nah, he must have really hosed that thing down.  Well, there's still blood.  Even 13, 20 years ago, they could still do a little blood sample. 
[01:46:00]  I think he must have really cleaned that thing off.  Piece of eye.  The best part about it was like two years later, there's a sandbar.  Somebody put a mailbox out on the sandbar with the woman's name on it.  Oh, my God.  What creeps.  Jesus.  It lasted about 15 minutes, but I saw it out there.  I lived right on the sandbar, and there was a mailbox out there with her name on it.  That is creepy.  So did the guy get in trouble?  Yeah, he's still in jail.  He was like an airline pilot.  He killed her in the bedroom, remodeled the whole house, and then chipped her up. 
[01:46:30]  Some guy's saying, I know the case.  The guy froze the body, and he put her in the chipper.  He was on a bridge chipping her into the river.  They found the nail on the riverbank.  There's a bridge right there, but he was actually on the riverbank next to the bridge.  I know the exact spot he was.  Dr. Gonzo from Whackbag is saying, is America's funniest mom, Andrea Yates?  Oh, my God.  All right, guys.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  She is, because she has five little jokes. 
[01:47:00]  She's going to spring on her husband.  Holy crap.  I thought for Mother's Day we would just avoid that one lousy day.  Chuckle, chuckle.  Chuckle, chuckle.  Chuckle.  Charles in Jersey.  Morning, boys.  What's going on?  Well, we're trying to break, but you've got something here.  What is it there?  Everybody knows the only way to get rid of a body is to put it in a 55-gallon drum and  pour tobacco juice and crabs on it. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, we've got to bring back that bit.  That really didn't make sense, my friend.  Yeah.  Watch it out.  Reminded us a little bit.  Really, really bad.  Anthony, before we go to break, talking about this murder crap.  Yeah.  You've got to tell a story about your old house that ended up on the news.  Oh, yeah.  Right after we moved out.  This is a sick story.  How old were you when you moved out?  About 15.  And you were, and this house was in East Northport or something like that?  Yeah, East Northport.  This was one of the houses you grew up in?  It was in Elwood behind Fred's Diner on Barry Place. 
[01:48:00]  How many years were you living there?  Quite a few.  Well, I lived there when I was a real little kid, like maybe 11.  And then I went to California and lived there until I was about 15.  And then came back and lived at this house for a little while again because my mother and  brother and sister were here.  So we moved out and a nice family moved in.  I guess it was a father who had custody of his two kids, a boy and a girl, son and daughter 
[01:48:30]  about, I guess the son was, I'm guessing, probably 9 or 10 and the daughter was 12, 13, somewhere  around there.  And I just want to paint the picture.  This was the house where you had the Christmas tree and all the presents for everybody.  Some of the best childhood memories ever.  It was really nice.  We had...  When you think about your childhood, this is the house, pretty much?  The house.  Oh, you have to take a leak?  No, there's some people in the studio.  I'm thinking of a celebrity.  Yeah.  Who is it?  That's George Foreman?  George Foreman's here. 
[01:49:00]  Holy crap.  George Foreman.  Looks like he could still kick some serious ass.  Jimmy just flees the show.  I know.  He just leaves.  He sees a celebrity.  He fled.  It's his obsession.  He just left the show.  He's getting his digital camera.  Where's my camera?  He'll leave the show.  He doesn't even tell us he's leaving.  No.  He's like, oh my God.  He got up and left.  Like, I don't even have to tell you I'm leaving the show.  Running after him.  He just went, run after him.  Get out of the way.  Get out of the way.  I've got to get my camera.  Because usually, if we go long, Jimmy will go, look, I can't do it. 
[01:49:30]  I can't sit around anymore.  I've got to take a leak.  But he just left the show to try to get an autograph, a picture with George Foreman.  Neil Diamond is singing with Al Roker.  It's terrible.  Whoa.  Touching him.  Oh, Al Roker singing with Neil Diamond.  We're all over the place today.  Bear with us.  Touching me.  Touching you.  Here we go now.  Everybody. 
[01:50:00]  Sweet Caroline.  Ah, ah, ah.  Your time has never seemed so good.  Take it, Al.  Oh, here it goes, Al.  Oh.  I'm going out of here.  Oh, yes.  Al Roker.  Al Roker.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry about that.  We had to jump onto that there.  Parenteau's out of jail.  Reaching out. 
[01:50:30]  All right.  Oh.  Anyway.  I just, George Foreman's in there.  I just walked out.  I just saw George Foreman.  No, no shit.  You left the show.  I just looked out and I saw George Foreman standing there.  I know.  George Foreman.  What's he doing?  Did you get a picture?  No, he's afterwards.  No, he's doing something for the Kids Channel.  What is he doing?  XM Kids.  Is he in the little thing?  Yeah, yeah.  XM Kids he's doing something for?  And we can't get him on the show, right?  Nope.  Why can't we get him on the show?  He's right here in our studios and we can't get him on.  Why can't we get him on?  He's promoting a Kids thing.  All right, listen. 
[01:51:00]  Here's the deal.  We'll let him promote a Kids thing.  Keep that door open.  And we'll just heckle him as he's walking by trying to get him on the show.  He's going to be here for a while, so.  We have, like, such a horrible reputation.  Why wouldn't George Foreman come on our show?  Oh, he could take care of himself, obviously.  We asked weeks ago.  He said because he's doing the Kids Channel, he doesn't want to be on our show as well.  We understand it's a kid thing.  We're not going to give you...  We won't get into anything nasty.  We love the guy.  It's George Foreman.  There's plenty to talk to him about.  All right, get the wireless mic outside the studio.  Get that set up.  Yeah, do that.  And when he...  Who's going to blindside George Foreman? 
[01:51:30]  Oh, I have no problem.  As soon as he walks by.  George, George.  You have no problem.  You're going to be sitting there.  Right.  I'm talking about who's going to be holding the mic.  Well, just leave the person taking it.  Honestly, just leave the mic outside the studio so we can pick up the audio of the exchange.  That's all.  If no one wants to hold the audio because they don't want to get punched in the face real  hard and wake up in a hospital bed with Christmas music playing...  Exactly.  I like that yesterday, by the way.  You know, then just leave it on the floor so we get some interaction with George Foreman  as he's leaving.  God, we're the worst.  We get huge celebrities that do come to this New York facility, but we never get to talk to them. 
[01:52:00]  Lindsay Lohan.  Lindsay Lohan was here, and she couldn't even come in to just say hi.  All the news that she was in at the time, also, all the stories about her, nothing.  We can't get her on.  All right, Adam.  Our reputation stinks.  All right.  We do have double O-Po, though.  Yeah, great.  I know.  We'll talk in...  But Anthony's got to finish his story, and I have to take a leak so bad that I'm getting  nauseous.  Uh-oh.  So, anyway, the house we grew up with, the Christmases, birthday parties, mama cooking  the nice Italian sauce. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, hold.  You can still smell the aroma, right, Anthony?  This was the house that I grew up in.  As I remember growing up, this was the house.  All of our pictures in the house, like Ope said, Christmas, things like that, and holds  fond memories.  And right after we moved out, this family moved in, this man and his son and daughter.  And about a month or two later, I see a picture of our house on the front page of Newsday 
[01:53:00]  out there on Long Island.  And the angle of the shot is exactly like a picture I have of the house.  It's like...  And I'm thinking, why is the picture I took of the house in the newspaper?  It was just, you know, the news had taken a picture from the same angle.  Very nice house.  Apparently, the son and daughter were at home.  The father was coming home.  I guess he was angry at something.  Knocked on the door.  The son and daughter opened the door, and he shoots them both in the face. 
[01:53:30]  Shoots them both in the face, where they died on the linoleum that me, my brother, and  mommy put in, in the front foyer.  Very, very proud of that.  And then he went in and shot himself in the head.  There it was.  My happy little house. 
[01:54:00]  And you saw, like, your house on the news and all that, right?  Oh, yeah.  I was on the news.  They were bringing the bodies out.  That's awful.  My house.  House I grew up in.  Right there on Barry Place.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  We've got to find that old...  We've got to find that story.  Oh, find the story.  Yeah.  It's got to be online so long.  A long time ago.  All right.  We really got to take a break.  We've got to take leaks.  We've got to see what George Foreman's about.  George.  When we get back, America's Funniest Mom.  There's some interesting audio here.  And as we go to break, in honor of Mother's Day, why don't we just play Hi, Mom.  I'm in porno.  It's an ONA classic. 
[01:54:30]  So sit back and enjoy.  Who's this?  Michelle.  Hi, Michelle.  You want to play Hi, Mom?  Yes, I do.  All right.  I hear you want to play Hi, Mom.  I'm in porno.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Now, where does your mom live?  Montana.  Well, what are you doing in Boston?  I'm a nanny.  You're a nanny.  Cool.  Maybe you could tell your mom you lost your job as a nanny and you had to make ends meet,  so you jumped into porno.  Okay.  All right.  I got your mom's number.  I'm giving her the call right now.  Okay.  Nutrition Center.  Hi.  Can I speak to Jean, please? 
[01:55:00]  Is this Michelle?  Yes, it is.  It's important.  Okay.  Hold on, hon.  Uh-huh.  Now, play it up.  Say you lost your job.  You had no other choice.  Okay.  You were all alone.  Hello?  Mom?  Yeah?  I have a problem.  I lost my job.  Why?  Because I just wasn't doing it.  I couldn't cope with it, you know.  I thought you said it was going great.  It was, but things just fell apart.  I'm having a really hard time, so I didn't tell you sooner because I was too scared to, 
[01:55:30]  but now I got a different job, but I'm doing...  I don't know how to tell you this.  What?  I'm doing porn movies?  No.  Yes?  No.  Mom?  No.  Why?  It's too late.  No.  Mom?  No.  You, hold on.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus, I think she believes you.  I'm shaking.  Michelle? 
[01:56:00]  Yeah?  Where can I reach you?  I have, like, three days to get out of here, so I...  You don't do that.  What?  Don't do what you told me.  Well, what am I going to do?  How am I going to get home?  You don't have money in the bank?  Well, yeah, but I kind of had to use some of it to get this rolling.  I had to get an agent...  No, you don't.  Where can I call you?  The same number, but, Mom...  What?  There's something else I have to tell you.  Happy Mother's Day.  I love you.  This is just a joke. 
[01:56:30]  I'm on the radio.  Oh, my God.  It's a radio program.  Oh.  I just wanted to let you know that I love you.  Oh, my God.  I'm thinking about you.  Mom?  You know, I think those things are so funny when they happen to other people.  I mean, I would sit and listen to them all day long because they're so funny, but that...  You killed me.  Oh, my God.  Mom?  Wait, Mom.  We're really...  Okay.  I am going to kill you.  I love you.  Wait, wait, Mom.  Mom, first kill us. 
[01:57:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're all you guys.  We put her up to it, and I got to admit, man, my heart sunk to my damn kneecaps.  Oh, my God.  I felt so bad for you.  I'm breaking out in a sweat here.  I'm thinking that it's too bad.  Happy Mother's Day.  Well, thank you.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Sweet oral pleasure.  Such a talented little heroin addict.  Oh, dear. 
[01:57:30]  Overdose.  Ramone.  Get the wood chipper.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[01:58:00]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Yeah.  All right.  We got lots going on, man.  We got George Foreman.  I mean, 30 feet away tops in another studio.  Yep.  And we got some stupid broad from the new Will Ferrell movie calling in today.  Who cares?  Oh.  Oh, no.  But they get George Foreman for the Kids Channel on XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:58:30]  I don't know.  But we got an exclusive interview with some actress no one knows anything about that's playing the wife of Will Ferrell.  My God.  I can't wait to talk to her.  What the hell's going on?  Maybe I'll ask her some rumbling the junk.  And I think that my mother looks down and thanks you every day as much as I do for how much you have taken us all into your heart. 
[01:59:00]  Look at this mother.  Looks like Grandpa Al Lewis.  I guess Regis is doing something nice for Mother's Day.  This old woman's got oxygen in her nose. 
[01:59:30]  You've been such a great mother.  I hate these TV shows that purposely tug at your heartstrings.  She looks like Tony Masanti when he was on ours.  How about a new dishwasher?  Look, let the colored gentleman bring it out of the truck for you.  That's how we talked back in the old days.  A new dishwasher.  How about our friends at Ashley Furniture giving you $10,000 to shop in their home store? 
[02:00:00]  You're getting 10 large, you old bag.  Don't fuck it up.  Guess what else, Pat?  To help you with the housework, for one year we have the famous Maid's Home Services team.  That's great, but she's not going to make a year.  Bring on the Puerto Ricans.  They'll clean your house.  All right, Kathleen, tell us what Pat's special dream would be for Mother's Day.  Pat's dream is to be with the grandchildren.  Uh-huh.  Like these two little kids right here, huh?  All right.  You ever been touched by an uncle? 
[02:00:30]  It sounds like a ship's horn, Pat.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Ray, this woman's going to ruin a cruise.  We're sending all of you, all 16 of you, on a family vacation so you can spend more time  with the grandkids.  Where are they going, Regis?  Here's what we got, guys.  We have live cruising reunion aboard the Norwegian's Pride of America, one of the great cruise ships  in America today, 16 tickets for you.  Regis, she's not crying.  Thank you for that family of yours and have a wonderful time, okay? 
[02:01:00]  That's who I'd be stuck in the elevator with, the woman in her oxygen tank.  Take care, Pat.  Good luck, everybody.  She could really use a cruise.  If she's in the sun, she's going to combust.  She was transparent.  You could see her veins pumping.  These shows stink.  Happy Mother's Day.  It's Mom's Dream Come True!  It's a Mom's Dream Come True special!  Hooking up old moms with their Mother's Day gifts. 
[02:01:30]  That's all well and good, but they go through the videotapes and they find the most pathetic moms.  Yeah, how about just a family that's like a normal family?  Right.  And you give them stuff and they can really appreciate it.  Do you know what it's going to be like for those people going on a cruise with this old bag that can't do anything?  How awful that's going to be.  It's a burden.  She is known as the burden.  Oops.  Grandma went off the side of the ship.  Oops.  Old Grandma Klinghoffer.  Thank you, Regis. 
[02:02:00]  Coming up on Regis, a dream of a lifetime.  Yeah.  Another pathetic mom, obviously.  The more pathetic, the better when they're trying to find those people.  They must screen these and just go, no, it's not pathetic enough.  I want to breathe in oxygen.  I want to be able to see her pulse in her eyelids.  What's the story about the Miss Disabled America or whatever?  This is an interesting story.  I don't know all the details.  I've got to read it live in the air.  But basically they had this contest to find Miss Disabled America or something like that.  Yeah.  And they stripped the winner of her title because she wasn't disabled enough. 
[02:02:30]  Not disabled enough.  Something like that, yeah.  What was wrong with her?  I don't know.  I've got to get the story.  We've been trying to find it for the last 15, 20 minutes.  They're hunting it down.  Miss Wheelchair America.  Or Miss Disabled.  Oh, you know what?  She stood up.  I'm not even kidding.  That was when I heard that she stood up.  She was Miss Wheelchair or something and she stood up.  I don't know if it was a goof or if she just wasn't as bad as they thought.  But that did have something to do with it.  Wow.  Yeah, she stood up.  Since I'm looking at the logo, it's Miss Wheelchair America. 
[02:03:00]  All right, well, we're getting the story.  How can anybody say that that's an appropriate title?  They always say that making Miss America is objectizing women.  And yet if it's something like this, it's showing the strength of the handy capable.  What's the difference?  Why are people so selective in where it's okay to exploit you?  It's sickening.  What is this one?  This just in.  Yeah, here.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Miss Wheelchair stripped of title.  Decision raises questions about requirement. 
[02:03:30]  When Janelle Lee was crowned Miss Wheelchair Wisconsin in January, she envisioned her role as an advocate for people with disabilities as an extension of the classroom.  Lee, a math teacher living with muscular dystrophy, was preparing to speak at functions across the state, hoping to educate a wider audience.  She's facing issues, blah, blah, blah.  Let's get to the meat and potatoes here.  She's being forced to abandon her plans.  A steering committee led by former Miss Wheelchair Wisconsin is stripping Lee of her crown. 
[02:04:00]  It said she was photographed in the Post Crescent's Heart of the Valley supplement, standing in her classroom, adding that she does not always use her scooter, and she walks in her classroom.  The move raises questions about criteria used in the selection process.  So, she goes around in one of the little rascals or something, and I guess as she's teaching, occasionally she'll stand up and walk around the classroom. 
[02:04:30]  The way I see it, you're either 100% disabled or 0% disabled, when in reality everyone is somewhere in between.  So, she's fighting it, and other people are saying she's not disabled enough.  The pageant established in 1972.  Oh, no.  Open to women ages 21 to 60. 
[02:05:00]  Boy, they're really opening this thing up.  21 to 60.  I guess it doesn't have to do with hotness.  What do they judge them on?  Did you get to this quote?  I can't go into it.  All I can say is she does not meet the physical requirements.  Why can't they go into it?  Yeah, go into it.  Why is it wrong to give somebody an award for being Miss America because she's hot?  That's sexist, and yet if you give somebody an award due to their disability, it's completely acceptable.  Mm-hmm.  How about a worst, the absolutely most useless in a wheelchair? 
[02:05:30]  Why don't we have that award?  Yeah, she's not useless enough.  The national pageant, yeah, women 21 to 60 who utilize a wheelchair, or in this case a scooter, for daily mobility.  That seems to be the requirement.  Mm.  That's pretty bad, though.  What a picture of her.  You stripped the title.  Is she hot?  What are you pulling the trophy away from her while she's in a wheelchair? 
[02:06:00]  She's got muscular dystrophy, she can barely hold on to the thing to begin with.  She's holding it, you're pulling her and the chair across the floor.  Give me that back.  You can't get it until you hit a curb.  Stay tuned for our swimsuit competition.  Legs most likely to be mistaken for white seaweed.  Oh, my God.  Anyone deserves to be honored.  It is definitely my mom, because she's the greatest of all. 
[02:06:30]  She keeps on giving, and I'm a special Regis moment.  That's an incredible story, isn't it?  We tried to make her dream come true, but we can't make her white.  I'm not going to make it through the show.  Oh, boy.  It takes your breath away.  Anyway, Tina told us that the one thing her mom really needed was a reliable van.  So we called our friends at Pontiac, and they sent over a brand new Montana SV6.  And they also volunteered to have it customized with a wheelchair leg. 
[02:07:00]  That's absolutely true.  Fantastic.  This mom has a kid that's in really bad shape.  Really?  Really bad.  I got the presents you gave me.  My mom was across the street.  Since o'clock in the morning.  Let's go.  That'd be great if it got carjacked right in front of the house.  Nice outfit.  She's wearing fire engine red silk pajamas.  Walking over to her mom's house.  Of course, she's got a baby. 
[02:07:30]  Up the ramp.  Banging on the window.  There's mom.  Mama.  Not to put my fire through the window.  Open the door, mother.  You got to come and play this to me.  Oh, boy.  That kid is really in bad shape.  Come on.  I got to show you something.  Well, that's what you get when you get pregnant at 55 years old.  Jesus.  Oh, Lord, where am I going?  What you got me doing, child? 
[02:08:00]  You want the dog to come?  Oh, my God.  She looks like she's on crack or something, this lady.  What this?  What you got me doing?  She's walking down.  Everybody wrote to Regis and Kelly.  Guess what?  Come on across the street.  I'll show you.  Yes, come on.  Actually, the mother doesn't look that old.  Which makes...  Surprise!  Doesn't surprise me at all.  Happy Mother's Day, Mom!  I hope you can afford a license, registration, insurance, taxes. 
[02:08:30]  Happy Mother's Day.  Aw, she's crying, Anthony.  She's crying.  Aw, she's crying.  She doesn't know what to do.  Pesititious.  She's precious.  Come on, Mom.  You got to come see it.  Come on.  Regis, I apologize for calling you a cracker-ass cracker.  You like the world?  Oh, my God.  They're going to gut it and customize it, just for Alexandria.  Great. 
[02:09:00]  This is beautiful.  I told her, they're going to put a wheelchair ramp in it and everything.  Customize it for Alexandria.  It's a minivan?  Yeah.  How do they customize it?  They take it to a lake and only have an R?  All right, well.  Two little car seats strapped into it.  Regis and Kelly making dreams come true today.  Sent a couple of snorkels.  Just to give him a couple extra seconds.  Say, why are we moving backwards?  Mommy.  Justin in Texas.  What's up, Justin?  Why is Mommy waving? 
[02:09:30]  I heard Terry Schiavo was favored to win the Disabled America pageant but failed the interview portion.  Ba-dum-bam-bam.  I wouldn't have minded it if you said Terry Schiavo.  Terry Schiavo.  Terry Schiavo.  Joe in Jersey.  He has a follow-up to the wheelchair story.  Go ahead, Joe.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I was reading on Yahoo News last week that I guess they felt bad that they dethroned her,  so they rethroned her some bogus Miss Wheelchair America, like kind of using the wheelchair half the time nonsense. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, all right.  Because they got some bunk over their decision.  Bunk.  Some guff.  Some guff bunk.  All right, thank you.  Watch it out.  Bye.  All right, let's get to the funniest mom in America here.  Yeah, because, you know, this is what comedy is about.  Female comics are good on their own.  Let me tell you.  They are some of the funniest things you'll ever see is a woman comic. 
[02:10:30]  The only thing that could possibly make it better is if they're a mom.  Let me guess.  There's going to be humor about their lazy husbands.  Oh, having to deal with the kids.  Having to deal with those darn kids.  All right.  Well, this was on TV, I guess.  I don't know.  I don't even know where it was on.  Probably Lifetime or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter.  It was on TV, and they were trying to find the funniest mom in America for Mother's Day.  Let's go to the first clip here.  Lynn Hurdle Price. 
[02:11:00]  I think this might be part of a routine, maybe.  Hey, everybody.  I'm Lynn Hurdle Price, and I'm in debt.  I fell in the debt.  Okay.  Why are you laughing?  Right away.  Please.  And I'm in debt.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  She's in debt.  Do you hear it?  Oh.  Why is she laughing?  Why are they laughing?  Everyone in the audience is in debt.  Because they're all nervous.  They're all nervous for these people.  Does this upset you at all, Jimmy?  No.  You work and slave years and years to try to build up a following with your comedy, and 
[02:11:30]  these hacks just like, and the audience is laughing, and ugh.  They don't bother me.  The way the business rewards awful bothers me, but some mom that wants to try to be funny,  it's like, yeah, good for her.  I don't have a problem with that.  It's not even they get their little contest.  That's fine.  It's the business in general.  It's guys at Comedy Central who make me sick.  You know, Doug Herzog, that type of mentality.  Yeah.  Yeah, people in power.  Not some mom just trying to get a few laughs. 
[02:12:00]  I think they're awful, but whatever.  All right, let's see if it gets better.  We'll start over here.  She gets a huge laugh because she's in debt line.  Hey, everybody.  I'm Lynn Hurdle Price, and I'm in debt.  I fell into debt around Christmas time, 1982.  The thing I hate about being in debt is all these calls you get from the bill collectors.  You know, back in the day, they were polite and trusting.  You're sitting at home.  Phone rings.  Hello? 
[02:12:30]  Hello.  May I speak with Ms. Lynn Hurdle Price?  Who's calling, please?  This is Mr. Horatio from American Express.  I'm sorry.  I'm not home right now.  All right.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  I am American Express money, and I'm dodging them.  Whoa.  Get the car crash, Anthony.  I got it.  No, this is beyond a car crash.  All right.  Breathe, Anthony.  Breathe.  Wow.  That, like, the setup was going too long without anything remotely funny. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  And then the payoff is so bad and so hack.  Oh, wow.  Maybe it gets better.  Don't worry.  Your camera's all set and ready to go, Jimmy.  Stop checking it.  Jesus.  I'm nervous.  He's got it on his hip pocket.  He's just ready to go.  Dude.  All right.  Well, we'll call back when you are.  Nowadays, they're rude and downright sneaky.  Send that home. 
[02:13:30]  Phone rinse.  Hello?  Hey.  Hey.  Lynn?  Who's this?  This is Ray Ray.  Ray Ray.  Yeah, Lynn.  Ray Ray.  Ray Ray.  Ray Ray from Roscoe's Chicken Shack?  Oh, Ray Ray from the House of Blues last night.  No, Lynn.  This is Ray Ray from.  If you've got money for Roscoe's Chicken and the House of Blues, you can pay your damn American 
[02:14:00]  Express bill this month.  I like her because her jokes are solid, but she has, like, a message with them.  Oh.  That's the response you should have gotten.  Yeah.  What have we got here, fucking comedian?  Here's the judge's response.  You've got great presence, really great timing, really engaging. 
[02:14:30]  You know, the three of us and the audience, you know, really with you the whole way.  And this is awesome.  Who are the judges?  Do we know?  Yeah.  No.  Who are they?  We'll try to get a list of the judges.  Yeah, I'm wondering if they're comedians or...  I'm sure they're top of their game.  From the entertainment field, I'm sure.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure Sinbad is one of them.  He's on every show.  No, Danny?  Well, that judge that you just played, there's three judges.  I don't know two of them, but one of them is Malcolm Jamal Warner from the Cosby Show.  Oh, well, okay. 
[02:15:00]  And he knows funny.  He knows funny.  He certainly does.  Worked with the Cos.  All right.  Let's go to the next one here, Anthony.  Christine Hurley.  I just...  I recently turned 40 years old.  Yes, I know.  That is hard to believe.  I was so funny.  That's right, Dr.  40 years old.  40 fucking times, sweetheart.  You know that when I turned 40?  I hate the sex.  Oh, good God.  I hate the sex.  Well, poor Jimmy Hurley has recently made a request.  He prefers that we not face each other while being intimate. 
[02:15:30]  Now, it's not so much that he wanted to try something new.  He says it hurts too much when he watches me roll my eyes through the whole thing.  I kid you not, people.  I kid you not.  Oh, because you're such a treat in bed.  Yeah.  I see your picture on the website.  Where is that?  Of course he wants to flip you over.  He doesn't want to see your face.  Jimmy Hurley.  He's wishing you spoke to someone with an angry face.  Look at her.  She's horrific.  Just some mom.  She's rolling her eyes, Anthony. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, you roll your eyes.  Because the sex is so bad.  Trust me.  He should glue her eyes in place with some jizz.  That'll stop him rolling.  Oh, my God.  That is awful.  Funniest mom in America.  She continues.  Once in a while, I do get some poor unsuspecting soul, some friend, some family member, they'll  come to the house.  They'll say, Christine, honey, we're going to take one or two of the kids for the day.  We're going to take them off your hands.  Enjoy yourself.  And I say, okay, that's great.  And they say, don't you worry about a thing. 
[02:16:30]  They are in good hands.  We're going to take good care of them.  I said, sweetheart, I don't care if you dress three of them up like freaking Macaulay Culkin  and fly them out to Neverland for four days.  Get them out!  All right.  Thank you.  Not bad.  That is not bad, right?  I'll have sex with my kids joke.  Not bad.  That's not bad.  You've got to give her credit for that.  You certainly do.  Let's go to the...  I don't care if you take them swimming over at Tommy Lee's house.  Let's go to the judge's response.  Wow.  So much energy.  Amazing energy.  Fabulous, fabulous delivery that way. 
[02:17:00]  Keep it up.  Keep working it.  And the material's a little outside of the box, which is great.  So, yeah.  Thank you, Jody.  All right.  They liked it.  They were a little shocked.  I think that was kind of a backhanded compliment.  What did they say?  The material's a little outside of the box.  You know, sounds like a good thing, but she's thinking, eh, it's not very mainstream saying,  you know, go take my kids to have sex with Michael Jackson.  What a coincidence, because Jimmy Hurley wants to be outside the box and in the rear.  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. 
[02:17:30]  Ba-dum, bum, bum.  Oh, Jimmy Hurley.  Let me tell you about him.  Jimmy Hurley.  Jimmy Hurley.  That brings back a memory, though.  I have this sister in Orlando.  She had two kids, and they're growing up now, but there was a time when I would go to Orlando  and visit her.  Yeah.  They wanted time to bang.  So I had this understanding with my sister that it was time to take the kids for ice cream.  And I would have to, like, take them out of the house and stall for a good hour, get  the ice cream and go to the park and things like that, knowing my sister's just getting 
[02:18:00]  railed by my brother-in-law.  Watching the kids lick the ice cream and you're just thinking, hey, what's going on at home?  Yeah.  Same thing.  But when we would visit, they would get so excited because they knew that we would be  taking the kids out of the house and they would just have the run of the place.  Just running around naked and jumping in the pool, skinny dipping.  And then I would come back to the house, and you could just tell they had sex.  It was just on their faces that they just went animalistic for an hour, hour and a half, 
[02:18:30]  whatever it was.  Oh, but that was my job.  Nitwit listener from Whackbag.  Are they trying to find the next Irma Bombeck?  The funniest thing she ever developed was cancer.  Oh.  Jesus Christ, Nitwit.  Oh, Carol Leifer is one of the judges.  Really?  Who owns Caroline's?  No.  Oh, no?  No, no, no.  Carol Leifer was a stand-up.  Caroline Hirsch owns Caroline's.  Oh, okay.  I always get that.  Carol Leifer was a writer.  I always get that confused.  I think Carol Leifer was, it might be her, was the inspiration for Elaine. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  It was one of Jerry's friends from back in the days.  I could be wrong about that.  And Jody Collins, some casting director.  Oh, Jody Collins.  Oh, Jody.  Oh, yeah, I actually know her.  She's married to Bobby Collins.  She's been very nice.  We're all going to Brian Regan tonight, right?  Yes, we are.  It's going to be fun.  Eight o'clock show?  Yes.  All right, let's go to the next one.  It's Nancy Winter.  Wow.  Hi, everybody.  Yay.  Oh, I'm telling you, we are having such a great time.  I haven't had this much fun since I was at Mardi Gras. 
[02:19:30]  Little tip for the moms.  Don't bring your 21-year-old daughter to Mardi Gras.  The place was insane.  At one point, I'm standing on the street.  There's a cop at the corner.  A girl comes running up, all hysterical.  She said, there's a pack of men sexually assaulting women on Bourbon Street for beef.  And the cop looks at her and goes, hey, lady, it's Mardi Gras.  What did you expect?  And totally blew her off.  I'm telling you, my daughter was there. 
[02:20:00]  I went up to him.  I grabbed him by the lapels.  I said, for the love of God, which way to Bourbon Street?  Wait, I get it.  The only problem with that is the setup wasn't long enough.  Jesus, endless story.  What was she trying to say?  She was going to get felt up and molested, too?  No, it sounded like she wanted to take her daughter down there to get felt up and molested.  No, her.  Her. 
[02:20:30]  She wanted to go?  She wanted some action, Anthony.  My thing is, who's the one?  I saw the quote.  They don't serve enough beer on Bourbon Street for some of those lunatics to sexually harass Nancy Witter.  The girl that told that joke, my husband is such a grouch, that Hedda N from New York.  All right, well, here's another clip of Nancy Witter.  I'm not a soccer mom.  I don't have the energy for it.  I know these women.  I drop the kids at school.  I go, hi, Joan.  She go, I can't talk.  I got to go to basketball, baseball, soccer, voice, and tap. 
[02:21:00]  Whereas I, on the other hand, discouraged my children from joining any sports or extracurricular activity.  I'd come home from work exhausted.  The second I sat down, they'd come running in.  They'd go, Mom, we're going to be late for practice.  I'd go, okay, coming.  Oh, kids, look who's on MTV. 
[02:21:30]  But, see if, we can explain, I guess.  See if the kids are into the whole MTV thing that they're going to get distracted and watch, let's say, Britney Spears on MTV.  They're going to forget that they need a ride to soccer practice.  Oh, okay.  I think.  I think she's a real smart mom.  Oh, Jimmy's out.  Jimmy's out.  George Foreman is making his way out of the kids' studio. 
[02:22:00]  Here goes Jimmy.  Let's just get the judge's remark here.  Really terrific job, a complete persona there.  I could picture you on a sitcom.  You have a fabulous character, great comedic timing and energy, really, really terrific.  And I like when you go a bit more racy.  I love the discouragement angle and I like the testings at the end and the things that give you a good time or not.  Really, really, really fun.  All right, whatever.  Outside the studio, Jim Norton is getting a picture with George Foreman. 
[02:22:30]  It just happened.  George Foreman put on the fighting stance.  Yeah, George Foreman showed that big, huge fist of his.  Let's see if we can baby bamboozle him and not even think we're on the air.  Maybe we'll do that.  Like, hey, George.  George is now talking to Big Kev.  I was wondering why Big Kev was here today.  Yeah, there's always something going on.  It's kind of weird when you see a guy like George Foreman having a huge, huge...  I'm just relaxing.  I'm just hanging.  Hey, hey.  What's up, George?  Hey, George.  What's up, George? 
[02:23:00]  How you doing, man?  Right on.  Right on, buddy.  All right?  How'd it go over there?  Wonderful.  I absolutely missed it.  Yeah?  You had fun on the kids' channel?  That was great.  What are you selling these days, George?  What do you want to buy?  What do you got?  I want to buy one of those grills, I see.  Ah, a setting grill.  Everyone's got the grill.  I got one.  It makes a great wedding gift.  I love them.  That's true.  Mr. Foreman, I'm telling you, Anthony actually bought a grill for a wedding present years ago. 
[02:23:30]  I did.  And everybody wants them on their wedding list.  When they get married.  They're fantastic.  They grill, and they burn the fat away.  The fat drips away, and it's very healthy.  And it makes both of the couples cook.  That's right.  That's right, because it's so easy.  He's signing grills, everyone, outside the studio.  George Foreman.  One of the greatest boxers of all time, Mr. Foreman.  That's right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hello, Mama.  When are you making the comeback, George? 
[02:24:00]  Are you fighting again?  I wanted to come back, but my wife told me, listen.  Yeah.  No, you can't do it.  And I told her, you can't tell me what to do.  I'm a man.  I'm a champion.  She said, you are not going to do it.  So I haven't done it.  But George, she's the heavyweight champion in that household.  The real heavyweight champion is my wife.  Yeah.  How's George, George, George?  And George is four, right?  She said, now, you see, you boxed for so many years.  You got hit so many times, you can only remember one name. 
[02:24:30]  You're not going back.  Then you're going to forget those.  Yeah.  You don't want to forget the kid's name.  Well, he named them all George, Anthony.  Of course he did.  He made it easy for himself.  That's the best way to do it.  Yeah.  Well, I would love to see you fight again, George.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I better not do that.  I may be out sleeping outside.  You look like you could.  In the bus.  You look like you could still kick some serious ass.  Uh-huh.  But I would never hit a donkey.  Thank you.  I got you.  Oh, boy.  He's leaving.  One picture. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, look at you.  One picture.  All right.  Jim is.  All right.  Now Jim's taking photographs.  Let me know when you guys are ready.  Jim's in a frenzy.  I know.  We're getting.  Damn.  That's where you look when you get them.  He's so fake.  Look at him.  Let's just listen in, man.  Big guy, man.  He's massive.  Is he a big guy?  Thank you so much for signing the grills.  I really appreciate it.  Yeah, man.  Oh, look at Jimmy.  Jimmy is just.  He is so happy.  And that's George Foreman. 
[02:25:30]  He's a big guy.  Nice guy, too.  Doesn't beat my Clinton picture, buddy.  Keep trying.  Keep trying.  If you get Ali, then I'll give it to you.  Why are you shitting on his little parade here he had?  Because we've been in competition for a long time.  Oh, yeah, I do.  What?  Get my picture.  There goes Opie.  Opie's just left the stage.  Opie just ran out of the studio also.  It's the Danny the Intern and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Welcome.  And Ben.  Yeah.  Ben Sparks.  Look at all the star fuckers out there.  God damn.  What? 
[02:26:00]  Me?  Look at you.  You got to get one.  You got to get one.  You got to get one.  All right.  It's George Foreman.  Get a picture.  Now we ain't going to break.  I will talk.  Why is Danny telling us to go to break?  We're all star-struck.  We're all star-struck.  He goes in the studio.  And that's what's great about this show.  It's just a cluster after.  We are star-struck.  It's George Foreman, man.  He's one of the greatest fighters to ever live.  We are all star-struck idiots.  You got your picture, Anthony?  Yeah.  All right.  You had to do it, bro.  Hey, did you shake his hand?  Yeah.  It's like a...  Big myth. 
[02:26:30]  It's like shaking a catcher's myth.  Big myth.  Do you hear what he just said?  Huh?  He goes, man, those guys are tripped.  When you come in, see if they'll come in.  He's always going to another appointment, but he said thanks.  Dude, we had a great interview with him.  We had a fantastic interview.  I would love to sit down and ask him Rumble in the Jungle questions, man.  He thought that Ollie's gloves had actual drugs on them or something that made him tired.  Wow.  I mean, he's got a lot of...  What I read in his book, he's not happy with the way that fight went over in...  Drugs on his gloves.  Yeah.  He felt that something was... 
[02:27:00]  He said he felt woozy.  He thought there was something...  Or in the water.  There was something he felt was in the water.  Something...  I would love to...  Slipped a mickey.  We...  I'd love to ask him about that.  We had a little bit of an interview.  I know.  We were shouting because he wasn't in the studio, obviously.  He didn't have headphones on.  He didn't have headphones, and he was about 30 feet away.  So we were just yelling through the door.  Great time.  And, yeah, we talked about the George Foreman grill, and the fact that he's not going to  make a fight come back.  Does he want to plug his book or anything?  Tell him to come in and plug anything he wants.  He didn't want to.  He was on XM Kids, huh? 
[02:27:30]  Okay.  It's a kid's book?  Yeah.  I got a great shot with him.  Did you?  Oh, dude.  I'm so happy.  He does the boxer thing.  Yeah.  I didn't do it, though.  He puts his fists up.  I just...  I should have done it with him, but I'm such a worm.  All right.  Why don't we continue with the funniest mom in America, Anthony?  Ah.  The funniest mom in America.  Instead of Jimmy.  Sorry.  Jimmy's got a look through his...  He's admiring the photo.  And we got grill signed.  What are we doing with them?  Charity auction. 
[02:28:00]  Eric is obsessed with this charity auction thing we're starting out.  He's getting everything signed, and then somehow we're going to, I don't know, get a website  up where you guys could bid for this stuff, and then the money will go to diabetes or  some other causes that we...  Cool.  Trying to chip in a padded toe.  Trying to get him a new toe.  That would be a great charity.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's go to Darlene Wesgore.  Trying to find the funniest mom in America.  Oh, Ben is sco...  What's... 
[02:28:30]  Grab the mic.  Uh-oh.  Grab the mic.  Oh, get out there.  There we go.  Hello.  What?  Oh, tell me.  What's going on?  What's going on?  Nothing.  It's just...  Problem?  No, no, no.  Ben's part of the problem?  It's just...  No, it just looks...  It's just...  We just...  We got interns.  Everybody runs to get photos.  It's like, you know...  Oh, boy.  It's just...  It's just unprofessional.  That's all.  It's unprofessional.  Not for you.  I'm not talking about you guys.  We got Eric's running to get photos.  Ricky's running to get photos.  Kev doesn't even work here.  He's getting photos.  Dude, I walked out of... 
[02:29:00]  Oh, boy.  I mean, I realize what I do is unprofessional.  I walked out of a live radio show with a camera.  It's different.  I mean, I know it.  I'm awful.  Look at Ben wielding an iron fist.  It's just...  It's just...  Ben, did you get one?  I like that Ben's doing that.  It's just bad, but it didn't look like that.  Did you get a photo?  No.  He's the chief foreman.  Hey, let me see one of the autographs on the grill.  Turn one of those one way.  Wow.  Ben is really pissed.  Yeah, he is.  He just walked out of the studio and looked at Eric and said, done.  What a nice autograph he has.  That's cute.  Ben is really pissed. 
[02:29:30]  He's back in his office.  I was hoping we could eavesdrop on him as he gave these guys a talking to.  A talking to?  Perhaps a bit more.  All right.  Champ.  A champ?  Quite a willful intern.  Champ.  A champ?  A champ griller.  He would have been a fun interview to talk about Ali and stuff.  Yeah, I know.  That's too bad.  All right, well.  Genius move by you guys, by the way.  Getting that mic out there while he was signing.  Because he was, you know.  He had no choice at that point.  There you go. 
[02:30:00]  Awkward for him.  But yeah, he talked.  I think it was funny.  He gave us a couple lines.  All right, Darlene Wesgore.  We're looking for the funniest mom in America.  Or I guess Nick at Night was.  Let's hear a little of her stand-up routine.  I'm the single mom.  And what?  Shut up.  You're so hot.  How could that be?  No, I swear to God.  Great.  Grandma's single.  No, but this is a stupid mistake I made.  And so if any of you are ever going to be single, maybe even tonight.  I don't know.  But don't move to the suburbs because that's where I live with my two boys. 
[02:30:30]  And you know who hates me?  All those moms.  And I hate them too.  We don't have them.  And I think that there's like this part of them where they think, oh, God, you know,  she might want my husband, oh, my God, ladies, relax.  Oh, you know what?  I don't want your husband.  I just want to gather them all around and tell them that.  I don't want your balding, pissed off, alcoholic, ice fishing going, El Camino driving,  all the young speed wagon listening to your husband. 
[02:31:00]  I'll take your son's.  That's not bad, right?  Yeah.  They're not that bad.  I mean, look, their moms, they're not as awful as they probably should be.  It's all that same, you know, my husband's an asshole.  My kids are annoying.  Drivel. 
[02:31:30]  I'm dried up now.  Yeah.  Menopause hit me.  There's nothing sexual about me anymore.  Hey, I'm a comic now.  You know?  Yeek.  I have a son in junior high.  Every day through the whole school year, he comes home with the homework.  I used to be able to help him, by the way.  P.S.  I can call her.  Yeah, I could.  Now, every day, it's to her.  It's like, hey, buddy, how was your day?  Okay, good, great.  Do you have homework?  Yes.  This is going to run right into The Simpsons. 
[02:32:00]  That's good.  What is it?  Geometry.  Do you think you can help me with it?  And then we just laugh and laugh.  And I'm this close.  As much as I love my son and I'm trying to be a good parent, I'm this close to telling him the truth about geometry.  And you know what that is.  I just want to look at him and go, you know what?  Screw it.  You'll never use it.  That's good.  Your father was a musician.  I'm a comic.  You're a waiter, sweetheart.  Yes, you're welcome.  Thank you.  I wish my parents told me that I wouldn't need all that crap. 
[02:32:30]  Stressing out in my room over dumb homework.  Over, you know, subjects that I knew I would never have to use.  Crap you'll never ever use in real life.  But I didn't know at the time.  They just teach you that stuff.  Just to...  So that you have something to do.  Just to exercise your brain.  Right.  Exercise your brain.  I use a lot of algebra.  Yeah.  Algebra.  Of course you're doing comedy.  Of course you're doing comedy.  Algebra for working out your jokes.  That's right.  If I get two X laughs...  I think there's maybe a hundred people in America that use geometry after school. 
[02:33:00]  At least geometry has some kind of a measuring ability.  Algebra is just nonsense.  5X times 4L just equals shit.  Who cares?  I've used some geometry in my day.  It comes up sometimes.  The schooling is so outdated, but they just don't have any creativity.  And they don't know how to restructure the whole thing.  Where the stuff would be a lot more useful for these kids after they get out of school.  And they're all on to it now.  European history? 
[02:33:30]  Russian history?  What?  Ugh.  Yeah, cover it quick and move on.  Don't make a big...  You shouldn't be allowed to major in history.  Why?  If you're interested in that, then, you know, that will be one of your little stupid hobbies  after school.  There's the history channel for that.  Good point, Ed.  That's it.  You just turn on the history channel.  Everything you need to know.  I knew by the time I was a senior that this was a bunch of horse shit.  Yeah?  I just was like, I'm never going to use any of this stuff.  By the time you were a senior?  You mean all the other years you really were motivated and thought I was going to do something? 
[02:34:00]  I was actually like a math whiz growing up.  I was one of those dumb kids taking, like, high school math in seventh grade.  Were you a math-leet?  Uh, yeah.  You wanted to sound like athlete because we're such geeky dweebs.  Just because I was good at math, you know, I was kind of like one of those special kids  where all the other kids are learning how to, like, multiply.  I'm already doing whatever the next level was in a special classroom with three or four geeks.  And it was just like, ugh.  And then I just kind of, I became a senior at Harvard Fields High School and just barely 
[02:34:30]  passed my math classes and haven't used it since.  It could have been the beautiful mind, I guess.  I mean, even if you're that good, what do you use it for in the end?  You could be like the beautiful mind without the actual math genius.  Just some fucking lunatic who thinks he has a roommate and he throws shit out the window.  The CIA is trying to kill him.  Looking for signals and all the paperwork.  Yeah.  That's why they're cutting off the end of the photocopies.  And if you're still teaching, I know a lot of teachers listen to our show, you're just 
[02:35:00]  a dummy.  Wow.  You're making no money.  You get no appreciation.  You get three months off.  Well, that's what they say, but they're not too happy about that.  I mean, we don't even pay our, we don't pay the teachers a decent salary in this country.  It just amazes me.  And then they're teaching the same old shit.  It's just the system.  That's the way it is.  There's no way to change it.  Well, who's in charge of the system?  Bureaucracy.  I bet you those Japs have figured out schooling.  And they're coming back to get us, I'm telling you. 
[02:35:30]  It's just a matter of time.  Bind their feet and hand them a book.  Awful.  I say Bukkake 101.  How about that?  Did you learn from the Japs?  All right, let's suffer through one more.  More moms?  One more mom.  One more mom.  We'll move on.  Hello.  How are y'all doing tonight?  Here in New York, you urban dolls.  Some of y'all are looking like, do we buy tickets to Hee Haw? 
[02:36:00]  Hee Haw?  No one's looking like that 1977 reference.  Hee Haw?  They're in New York City and they know what they bought tickets for.  Y'all are looking at me like you're staring at Hank Williams Sr.  That's stupid.  No one's thinking that.  Who am I?  Tom Mix?  That's going back to like 1919.  Did I go too far?  I think I went too far.  I just knew it was old.  Y'all are looking at me like I'm the new deal.  I hate when comedians put something in the mind of the audience. 
[02:36:30]  Like, look at this guy.  He's thinking.  And it's like, no, he's not.  No, he's not.  I'm not.  Then again, I do that.  So I just caught myself.  Which one?  You guys are looking at me like I just beat child kiddie porn charges on a technicality.  That's a great line.  They are.  I'm kind of making fun of their look and they're kind of right.  Yeah.  So I guess it kind of all comes out in the wash.  Good point, Jim.  Good point.  Yes, you did. 
[02:37:00]  I do have three beautiful little children.  They're 11, 9, and 7.  I had three babies in four and a half years.  Good looking man down here.  Yes, I did.  But when I found out about my baby child that I was pregnant with her, I was shocked and dismayed.  And I called my husband at work and I said, you're trying to kill me, aren't you?  With a slow vaginal death.  All right, someone's going to explain why that could possibly be funny. 
[02:37:30]  Why is she surprised that she got pregnant?  That was painful.  Didn't she feel the jizz entering her womb?  I'd rather hear Susan Smith's comedy album, Call Me When the Bubbles Stop.  And I put the thing in reverse and then all of a sudden the gas tank came up empty and I'm like,  am I going to have enough gas to get here in this lake?  And the little ones whinging and crying, crying. 
[02:38:00]  I took a look, last thing I saw were just tears falling on the seatbelts.  I said, what am I going to do?  I'm going to get in trouble.  And then I went and bought a dark Hershey's chocolate and it hit me.  I know who I blame.  She blamed her.  All right, here's one more piece of her comedy.  The name of her album would be either When the Bubbles Stop and the bonus tracks are called Two Empty Little Beds. 
[02:38:30]  It's Mother's Day in two days.  It certainly is.  I know it's very sad, but you know, she is.  And I said to my husband, well, look on the bright side, at least now we have a room to put the computer in.  You always wanted your own office.  Let me explain to y'all where I was in my life.  I had a 13-month-old baby girl in diapers and a three-year-old beautiful little boy in Superman panties with doo-doo balls falling out at the grocery store. 
[02:39:00]  I thought, oh, Lord, did anybody see that?  I don't have anything in my purse to pick it up with.  If some little child going to think it's a milk dud, just keep on moving, y'all.  Let's keep on moving.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Have your kid crapping where I buy food. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, I hate children.  Oh, do I hate children.  Ugh.  Do you like when they touch your mouth with their hands?  They never do.  I wouldn't even know what that's like.  I couldn't even fathom that.  But they're sticky little fingers.  Some of them are cute.  Crap balls in the supermarket.  Some of them are cute.  Well, I guess we'll just leave that there.  Great.  She doesn't mean it.  I'm not saying they're not cute.  It's like a puppy.  You look at a puppy and go, oh, that's cute.  I don't want him home pissing on the floor.  Or crapping in the hallway. 
[02:40:00]  Little kid's cute.  You look at him.  You go, hey, there's a cute kid.  Move on.  Maybe a coochie coochie under the chin.  There's no coochie coochie either.  A little eee.  I like doing things like if I see a kid, if a mother's holding a kid or it's in a little  stroller and they look up at me and the mother's not looking, I'll like make a face.  So do I.  I do the same thing.  And then I'll make like the slicing motion with my finger on my neck and go like. 
[02:40:30]  And the kid starts crying and it's hysterical.  I know how to give.  Mother doesn't know why.  I know how to give the evil eye, though.  If a kid's screaming and yelling and they're looking at you because they want that feedback and that attention, I give them the look of death.  It shuts them up every time.  And the mom's like, why are the kids?  Wow, that was weird.  And then you're already walking, you know, your way or whatever.  Yeah.  It's cute when the mom just gets the kid over the back and she's burping him to walk up and just give him like a little coochie like, come here. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, how old is he?  I do have one kid pet peeve, by the way.  Yeah.  One.  Well, I mean, when they're screaming and yelling in public, like restaurants and stuff, I don't get why the family just doesn't leave the restaurant.  I don't understand that.  Get up.  Get out.  With a plane.  Well, that's what I was going to get at.  That's what I was going to get at.  All right.  I understand.  You're a family.  You've got a kid.  You've got to go see stupid grandma in Milwaukee, what have you.  And so you're all on the plane.  And it takes forever for the kid or the baby to stop screaming, right? 
[02:41:30]  Drive.  Finally.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I understand some whatever.  Some people don't have a choice.  Whatever.  Well, this is the point I want to make.  So the kid finally falls asleep for the flight.  It happens to all of us.  We've been doing a lot of flying.  Kid falls asleep.  There's peace and quiet on the plane now.  Everything is great.  So I see this time and time again.  So many mothers and fathers, they realize because the pilot's saying, you know, we're about to start our final.  Descent.  Descent or whatever. 
[02:42:00]  Into Los Angeles.  So this is the cue to the parents out there to wake up their kids.  Really?  To get them ready for, you know, departure of the plane.  You know when the pilot says that, you have a good half hour still.  Yep.  Easily.  You know, and then you taxi, and then, you know, blah, blah, blah.  You know the deal.  And all of a sudden they wake up the kid because they think, oh, we've got to get the kid ready for, you know, departing the plane.  And, you know, get ready.  And then the kid, of course, starts screaming again.  You don't have to wake that kid up until that cabin door opens.  Exactly.  Ugh. 
[02:42:30]  Just put them all in overhead.  Just pop them all in the overhead and soundproof it.  Oh, they're cute.  You give them a little pinch.  Oh, yeah.  Give them a pinch.  All right.  Let's see who the winner of the funniest mom in America was, okay?  And the winner of Nick at Night's Funniest Mom in America is...  You motherfucker! 
[02:43:00]  You motherfucker!  Oh, there it is.  All right.  Oh, brother.  I was really hoping to find out who won that.  Wow, that really broke apart.  That one.  I'll say it's it.  To see a CD come apart like that.  We'll play this from here.  Yeah.  All right.  Hit that.  We'll continue in just a bit.  You love your kids, but sometimes they can be a handful.  Kids are great when they're other people.  Who can you trust when it comes to your young'uns?  You change them.  You wash them. 
[02:43:30]  You bathe them.  Anthony's daycare oasis is a paradise.  You're in prison.  You're in baby goddamn prison.  Filled with joy.  We don't think they're cute.  Tenderness.  We think they're annoying.  And most of all, Anthony's love.  I can only hope your child turns up like little Adam Walsh without his head.  Parents adore our staff.  These guys hate kids.  And our facilities are safe.  I have burning cauldrons of wax just sitting around for aesthetics.  Just listen to these happy children frolic through Anthony's daycare oasis.  I hate your kid, and I wish him dead. 
[02:44:00]  Just take it from Anthony himself.  Grab your little friggin' rat and say, we love you, Anthony.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus.  Big Mouth's former pop star, Boy George, 43.  Doesn't look it.  Am I right or wrong?  Won't let go of his claim that Bush singer Gavin Rosedale is hiding an 80s fling with 
[02:44:30]  drag queen Marilyn.  Ugh, what a chattel tale.  This is George.  When I was writing my memoir called Take It Like a Man.  Oh, God.  Oh, shit.  This memoir is called Take It Like a Man.  You might as well have written that in disappearing ink.  Take It Like a Man.  And Bush were well on their way to rock stardom, and he appeared in my house to persuade me  not to include him in Maryland.  Oh, Rossdale wrote in his new book.  What?  Uh-oh. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, God.  You just fucked this up.  I just screwed something up there, Jimmy.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  You didn't proofread, did you?  You didn't proofread.  You didn't highlight.  No, they fucked up.  They did.  They did.  Yeah, by putting that in the fucking magazine.  Oh, wait.  Rossdale wrote his new book.  Oh, Rossdale.  It is written in English.  Oh, that's the Bush guy.  No, it's wrong.  Is it?  Big Mouth, former pop star Boy George, won't let go of his claim that Bush singer Gavin  Rossdale is hiding an 80s fling with drag queen Marilyn, period.  You got that part, okay.  When I was writing my memoir, Bush were well on their way to rock stardom, and he appeared 
[02:45:30]  at my house to persuade me not to include him in Marilyn, Rossdale wrote in his new book.  What the fuck is that?  So they're saying that Boy George is claiming something about Rossdale, but then Rossdale  showed up at his house and said, please don't let me include this in my book.  That doesn't make any sense at all.  That does not make any sense.  It certainly doesn't.  I think those guys are all hooked on glycerine.  You are vindicated, Jim.  I don't think, and this is Rossdale wrote his new book, I don't think Marilyn has ever 
[02:46:00]  really gotten over Gavin.  So apparently Gavin Rossdale is writing in the third person.  Either he's a sociopath, or Terry Schiavo typed this.  I don't think Marilyn really got over Gavin, Rossdale reportedly said after the first book.  George thinks everyone is gay, but who takes, what's his take on the rumor's return?  It's old news, his rep tells us.  Yuck.  So you knew Boy George's real name before you read that.  That's not even in there.  I know, you're right. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, you did.  No, I did.  Thank you for pointing that out, because I didn't even realize you just knew his name.  How long have you known that?  I don't know, I just learned it early on.  It was on the big poster he had on his wall.  Yeah.  I mean, after I'll tumble for you, you have to read all you can.  That was actually a good one.  I prefer Carmen Chameleon.  It's not Carmen Chameleon, it's Karma Chameleon.  I thought it was Carmen.  No.  I always thought he had a pet chameleon named Carmen.  I'd be proud that I didn't know that.  A little Spanish chameleon just attacked and stole from the other reptiles. 
[02:47:00]  Where in the world is Carmen Chameleon?  Go in the tunnel, Carmen.  Go in the tunnel.  What's the matter, Carmen?  I don't know.  Ooh.  Here we go.  Whatever was wrong, it's right now.  Oh, you feel all bad.  He was going to get all mad at his carrot juice.  Now he's just smiled.  There's something wrong with my carrot juice.  Eric, remember this.  When Jimmy's getting ready to get really mad, we'll just play this.  We'll break out Karma Chameleon.  He'll start to dance and wiggle his head like that. 
[02:47:30]  Make sure you fill us in at the exact moment that load hit you in the face during this song.  That's the money shot.  That moment already passed.  It's right at the beginning.  That's wonderful.  Do you move real fast at this part coming up?  Here it comes.  I promise you, man.  You're popping back and forth.  You tickle the bag here and then some...  Huddle off, huddle off. 
[02:48:00]  I like your tickling bag.  You tickle the bag.  Very good.  Oh, God, the 80s suck.  Ruby and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Hey, let's go right to the phones and talk to brother Joe. 
[02:48:30]  Anthony's brother.  What's up, Joe?  Hey, kids.  How do you do, Joe?  How you doing, Jimmy?  Joe's constantly on the road now.  You don't even see him anymore, right?  I haven't seen Joe in months, I think.  How long has it been?  It's probably been two months before the cruise. 
[02:49:00]  It's been a long time, man.  Yeah, Joe's busy.  Mommy's Day, though, on Sunday.  Yes, Mother's Day.  We are going over to my mommy's house out on Long Island.  Yeah, you're doing good.  We're going over to Dawn's house.  You'd show up at Mom's in the hole.  Oops.  We're going over to Dawn's house?  Yeah.  I don't even know where the hell I'm going.  Fucking family.  Jesus Christ.  They could special for us.  Great.  Going over to Dawn's house.  You don't need to know, Anthony.  You're a millionaire.  Have the limousine just pick you up.  I'll just have the car bring me there. 
[02:49:30]  Wherever.  Go bring me to wherever this Mother's Day thing is happening.  You just sit there and look down on your whole family.  Look how well I'm doing.  My assistant has told me I have some Mother's Day thing I need to do.  And you make them all sit in the house.  Then you sit in the limousine for a half hour.  Right.  On the phone.  And they have to wait until I get there before any festivities start.  Have your assistant run in and prep the family?  Yeah, sure.  That's my family. 
[02:50:00]  Joe, the band's going well, huh?  I'll sit in the limo and drink with Ann.  Yeah.  The band's going well, right, Joey?  Oh, dude, we're booked.  We have more than 90 dates between now and the end of 05, and I'm booking into 06, right?  More gigs than the real U2.  Actually, yeah.  Yeah.  We work way more than the real U2.  Where are you guys working?  Tonight we're at a place called The Asylum in Portland, Maine, 121 Center Street.  And if you want more information, you can call 207-772-8274. 
[02:50:30]  They're giving away two U2 tickets for the Fleet Center tonight.  And there's a local rock radio station hosting the festivities.  Hey, hey, great.  Yeah, it'll be a crazy one tonight.  Sounds fantastic.  You know, last night we were at a place called Brennan's Blackthorn in Southeastern, Mass.  So we're still here on the Holiday Inn, getting ready to go take a soak in the jacuzzi and do breakfast with the boys. 
[02:51:00]  A Holiday Inn jacuzzi.  Ugh.  Yeah.  What kind of a Petri dish is that?  Wow, they keep these things nice, man.  I'm at a top-notch Holiday Inn.  Look at them cutting corners.  We can't go in a good hotel.  It'll cut down on our profit margin.  Bottom line.  Last night we were at this place, Brennan's Blackthorn.  You can't believe how many people were asking for the song Shit Dick.  Really?  Why would they think you did Shit Dick? 
[02:51:30]  I don't know, man.  I don't know.  Maybe they'd pop up with a parody.  That'd be interesting to hear a U2 version of Shit Dick.  Shit Dick!  Bloody Shit Dick!  There were so many ONA fans at this place in Southeastern.  Anywhere we play in Massachusetts, up Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine.  Just a ton of Opie and Anthony fans, man.  Very cool.  But so well, they come out to see us.  What's the place again tonight, Joe?  Tonight it's called the Asylum. 
[02:52:00]  It's a big rock club up in Portland, 121 Center Street, Portland.  And tomorrow night is Tammany Hall in Worcester, Mass.  And they're doing the same thing over there.  It's a big deal.  Worcester, your old stomping ground there.  Worcester!  And they're giving out tickets to see U2.  Yeah, yeah.  They're giving away a couple of tickets to the Fleet Center.  And these guys do an unbelievable job with this band.  It's just amazing.  Got to say it.  Just amazing.  We have some new demos for you, too, Opie.  For you, Opie. 
[02:52:30]  I know the ones that we had, the live ones, you weren't too hot on.  No, because I wasn't trying to smash you.  I just know the band sounds much better than what you gave us that day.  Yeah, no, they were live tapes.  That's the ones we gave you were live.  And these couple of clips that me and Tom did are studio.  And they'll definitely be airworthy.  I'll be coming in tomorrow to cut some spots with Steve.  And we'll probably use them.  All right.  On Monday.  Monday?  All right.  We'll see you on the radio Monday. 
[02:53:00]  All right, brother Joe.  Goodbye, Angel.  Have a good show.  Jimmy, we'll see you soon, man.  Kiss you Sunday.  Later, boys.  Your brother gets the plug, and now I've got to plug something for my brother.  Of course.  It's the brother plug.  My brother came up with an Opie and Anthony Spread the Virus t-shirt with a brand-new Opie  and Anthony logo.  He's taken pre-orders only for, I don't know, a couple more days.  And then, you know, he's going to get a whole bunch made, but it might not be the size  you want.  Really?  So you can get all those freakish sizes if you pre-order.  And I guess Anthony and I have to sign like a hundred of them. 
[02:53:30]  So he got a chance at an autograph to Opie and Anthony Spread the Virus t-shirt.  He didn't even ask us.  Signings.  He just told everyone that's what's going to happen.  Is that the one that Eric was wearing that day?  Yeah, there it is.  Right.  Yeah, it's a great, great logo.  So if you want to see it for yourself, it's up on opianthony.com.  You can check out the t-shirt for yourself.  And if you like what you see, you can send him an email or, I don't know, one of his cronies  an email.  I think he's checking an email address called Dr.  You spell out Dr.  D-U-K. 
[02:54:00]  DrDuck at AOL.com.  All right.  DrDuck D-U-K at AOL.com.  If you want to pre-order your Spread the Virus t-shirts, it's definitely a very cool design.  Yep.  All right, Anthony.  Between the brothers, Kay.  Now that we've supported our brothers.  Yeah, we haven't.  I don't have any brothers.  We made them a couple of extra bucks.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I mean, we're doing quite well for ourselves and we have to take care of  family, you know.  Anthony.  Must allow the brothers to wet their beak.  People don't believe that you actually write your own brother a check every month. 
[02:54:30]  Of course.  Yeah.  Well, you've got to put Joe on the payroll.  Guys, like I said, pretty much responsible for me sitting here.  You've always done that?  Yeah.  Wow.  It's been a while.  Take care, Joe.  Great, dude.  And I gave Opie the tape.  And I also do some things for my brothers.  Isn't that sweet?  I do some things.  And my sister might, once in a while, ask me for something and I say, shut up!  I help no one!  And she's such a nice, nice woman, man.  I'm kidding.  She doesn't ask for anything about it.  Your sister's beautiful, nice, sweet. 
[02:55:00]  She really is a nice girl.  She just wants some attention from her big brother.  We actually get along very well.  We didn't, we were younger, we had a little, nothing bad, but we get along very well.  Oh, you're very good.  My little nephew.  All right, we've got to put the Pat O'Brien thing to bed, Anthony.  Yes.  Pat O'Brien was on the Dr. Phil afternoon show.  Do you want to hear a little of that or do you want to go right to what he said on his  show, The Insider?  I'm done with him and Dr. Phil.  Yeah?  There's really nothing more that he's going to add to any of this. 
[02:55:30]  I want to hear what he said on The Insider.  All right, yeah, well, he was finally back on his own program.  Mm-hmm.  And it was last night on The Insider.  In case you missed it, here it is.  As promised, I have something to say to all of you, the Insider viewers, in just a moment.  First, is Larry Spencer has something to say.  Oh, the big tease.  He's teasing with his own little tragedy.  And it's a tease.  It's a big tease.  I bet you they finally had him say what he had to say at the end of the show, right?  Mm-hmm.  So you have to sit through all that crap.  Oh, it's the end of the show. 
[02:56:00]  That's what I'm assuming.  That's right.  Not only did Pat face Dr. Phil, he had to face some pretty tough questions from me as well.  That's right.  Oh, no.  Pat had to face some pretty tough questions from me.  Ugh.  Did this whore actually get in the mix?  Yeah, they had to make it.  Well, you know the other shows were probably doing stories on Pat.  Yeah.  So why should the Insider be left out?  He left out.  Right.  Well, Larry Spencer doesn't...  There's nothing tough about her.  Pat, would you have licked ass? 
[02:56:30]  Would you really have let Betsy eat her pussy?  Well, let's see how tough the questions are, Anthony.  I know I can't drink again, because when I drink, I know on the other side of that door  is hell.  In our sobering sit-down, nothing was off-limits.  Let me ask you this.  Have I ever seen you sober?  Were you drinking every day?  No, not during the day.  Never missed a day of work.  Never missed an hour of work.  Never missed a minute of work.  That's the tough question?  Are you drunk right now? 
[02:57:00]  What's the tough question?  The question everyone wants to know is if he had that threesome.  Did he hook up?  What is Betsy thinking and feeling these days?  How did that night end?  What is the name of this woman?  How did that night end?  Nothing's off-limits.  This is Lara Spencer, I guarantee knows the girl that was being harassed.  This bitch stinks.  Did you ever drunk drive a spaceship?  What awful softball she's lobbing in.  Did I ever see you sober?  Are you kidding me?  You stink, Lara.  Even Tippi Thomas is sober, you know. 
[02:57:30]  Sure he is.  Sometimes.  Sometimes.  Once.  But I drank at night.  I know it got a little bit tough, and he was not holding back any of his questions.  Was there a moment where you said, I'm out of here?  I'm walking.  No.  Those days are over for me.  Dude, she's going into some weird territory here.  That was a tough interview where you attempted to walk out in the middle.  Wow.  That's a tough question when you'll actually ask about someone else who has tough questions.  I hope she's fucking putting a wood chipper by a lake. 
[02:58:00]  You stink, Lara.  She really needs to be back on News 12 doing stupid reports from the side of the LIE.  Yep.  That's where she began.  Lara Spencer.  Ugh.  Days are over for me.  I had to own up to some really bad behavior, which I was happy to do.  But humbling it has been.  I'm totally humbled.  Look, I was 40 days in rehab.  I was on kitchen and toilet duty the entire time.  The latest headline in this week's People magazine says it all. 
[02:58:30]  Pat allowed the magazine's cameras inside his Hollywood Hills home to get a glimpse at what has become his private inner sanctuary.  In the article, which hits newsstands tomorrow, longtime friend Michael J. Fox talks about Pat saying, quote...  There's a lot of spelling mistakes in that one.  How the hell can you read the statement?  Jesus, I hope he dictated it.  I'll type it myself.  Michael J. Fox is a longtime friend of Pat O'Brien's?  Apparently so.  Who knew?  Who knew? 
[02:59:00]  There's some wacky Hollywood friendships out there.  We learn something every day on this show, huh?  I just want to suck your...  I want you to lick Betsy's ass while your hand shakes and you spill coffee all over yourself.  Tomorrow, longtime friend Michael J. Fox talks about Pat saying, quote...  It was something he thought he might need to get a handle on.  But each person has to find their own bottle.  If this wasn't Pat O'Brien that this happened to, what would your headline for it be?  Well, that wasn't the Pat O'Brien you know. 
[02:59:30]  That was Pat O'Brien fueled on alcohol.  My headline would be...  Hopefully my headline is going to be Pat O'Brien gets second chance.  That's the headline I like.  As embarrassing as this ordeal has been for Pat, he told me he...  I mean, she asked, what would the headline be?  And she's talking about on the show.  An honest answer would have been, insider host, drunk, sex-crazed night of perverse phone calls and cocaine.  What was his answer?  Well, I hope it would be. 
[03:00:00]  Pat O'Brien gets a second chance.  Yeah, that's what the host of one of these rag tabloid shows would put forth as their headline.  No, the headline is, stay tuned for our recordings of a sex-crazed addict on the loose on the town.  That's what she was asking for.  Or, this guy is so...  He's a liar.  He has not recovered from anything.  He's not being honest. 
[03:00:30]  She's worse than he is, though.  Because at least he's got to say that.  I mean, if I was him, I'd try to weasel out of it, too.  I think it would have been very funny and sincere if he would have come up with some kind of sensational headline for his story.  You know?  That would have been more honest and more...  You know, you'd have thought, wow, that's cool.  He's kind of got a sense of humor about it.  He's being honest about it.  But no, second chance.  Okay, it's a host of another show.  Pat O'Brien sitting in the seat he's sitting in now, not having gone through what he went through. 
[03:01:00]  Another host from another tabloid show did exactly what he did.  Pat's going to sit there and go, let me write the headline for this.  I hope he gets a second chance.  No!  Deadline.  As embarrassing as this ordeal has been for Pat, he told me he is so grateful for sobriety.  And all the support, especially from his son, Sean.  My greatest moment in all this was when he put his arm around me in front of a whole group of people.  And he said, I'm here to support my dad. 
[03:01:30]  And to be in rehab and have him put his arm around and said, this is my dad.  I'm here to support.  It's amazing.  What's amazing about it?  What's amazing about it, Lara?  Amazing.  Holy shit, is she a fraud?  And she's like, nothing was off limits.  We heard nothing there.  Absolutely nothing.  Ass suck cock from whackbag.com.  That's got to be a fake screen name.  It might be.  That is real name.  Michael J. Fox met Pat O'Brien in the alternative future when Pat stole the Gracie's World almanac 
[03:02:00]  and gave it to himself and bought pussy and coke with it.  I didn't even know that, but apparently that's how they met.  That's how they met.  All right, well, here's Pat signing off from the Insider with finally what he needed to tell everybody.  Dude, her questions are pretty tough, though, man.  I've got to be honest.  They are hard-hitting.  She said, like, what would the headlines be? 
[03:02:30]  I mean, there's not a lot of room to maneuver there.  She was right.  Nothing was off limits at all.  Got a lot of unanswered questions there.  I feel bad for wishing ovarian cancer on her.  Pat, thank you so much for your honesty in answering my questions.  You know we all welcome you back.  And support you.  Oh, Jesus.  Nothing.  What?  What did Hawk just do?  What did Hawk just do with our nude pictures and semi-nude pictures? 
[03:03:00]  He looked at them all up and looked under them.  No, they were taped up the other way so you couldn't see them.  So George Foreman wouldn't see naked bodies.  No, no, that was a smart move.  Is that why the only sign that's showing is where's Chester?  My request.  And donkey sausage instead of shit dick?  It was Jimmy's request because he didn't want to blow his photo off.  No, no, no.  He might have got him in.  If he came in.  The dildo is gone off of the shelf.  Dude, but if he came in and then saw that stuff, that's good radio.  No, he might have just walked out, though, or said one thing. 
[03:03:30]  You never know.  His guy might have come in even.  His guy might have come in and looked around and said, well, you never knew.  It was worth the chance.  He's forming.  I hear you.  So it was a good move.  All right.  Ryan from Minnesota.  Actually, let's let him say it.  This does say it all.  Ryan, go ahead.  Hey, you know, Pat O'Brien, he's not sorry that he was doing that stuff.  He's sorry he got caught.  That's exactly right.  He was having fun.  Well, perhaps you didn't hear the interview he did with Lara, sir.  Perhaps you didn't just hear the tough questions that this guy just fielded. 
[03:04:00]  And a lot of people, Wayne from Canada, thinks Pat will hit the bottle again.  Yeah, what does Wayne know?  He's listening illegally.  Wayne's a thief and a liar.  So good to be back, Lara.  Thank you.  And now I'd like to say something to you guys at home.  Uh-oh.  I'm Pat O'Brien, and I'm an alcoholic.  For the past 50...  Damn it, where's my laugh when I need it?  Pat, thank you so much for your honesty and answering my questions.  You know we all welcome you back and support you. 
[03:04:30]  It's so good to be back, Lara.  Thank you.  And now I'd like to say something to you guys at home.  I'm Pat O'Brien, and I'm an alcoholic.  The past 50 days, I've been on a journey that has been nightmarish yet challenging and indeed fulfilling.  I checked myself into an alcohol rehabilitation center in mid-March for a problem I had been in denial over.  But for you loyal viewers, not for a second did I ever appear on this program or others under the influence.  That's the way it will be moving forward.  You should know that in the end, I don't work for Paramount or for our parent company, Viacom. 
[03:05:00]  I work for you, the person holding the remote control.  It is you who I'm indebted to, and it is for you that I will continue to bring you the news here with integrity, fairness, and a sense of luck that I get to do it in the first place.  With all that has gone on, I live by the following.  God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. 
[03:05:30]  Make that up?  That will be back in a moment.  This?  Jimmy's ready to throw himself out the window.  I understand he's doing damage control.  First of all, Opie and Anthony worked for the people, too, and Viacom still found a way to fuck them.  However, they wouldn't fuck you.  I don't work for Paramount or Viacom.  I work for you, the people holding the remote control.  No, you don't.  We said something similar, and we were still shown the deal.  Maybe he shouldn't say.  Maybe Dana McClintock should fucking come out and say it again.  This spokesman asshole. 
[03:06:00]  Ah, my name's Pat O'Brien, and I'm an alcoholic.  We all know that there are certain 12-step meetings that open like that and close with a serenity prayer, you melodramatic fool.  My name is Pat O'Brien, and I like to lick ass.  That's right.  How about the sex addiction?  Why do you want to be honest?  Let's address that.  Yeah.  Ah, I'm a sex addict as well.  My name's Pat O'Brien, and I like to drink on Sundays.  I'm an alcoholic.  Alcoholic.  My name is Pat O'Brien, and my girlfriend Betsy is quite the bag licker. 
[03:06:30]  I don't work for Paramount or Viacom.  I work for Jack Daniels.  I don't work for Sprint or Verizon or any other cell phone.  Oh, boy.  My name is Pat O'Brien.  And that serenity prayer, I'll say one thing, though, but that was a really sincere rendition of the serenity prayer.  Yeah.  That was really cool.  You know it was just rolling on that teleprompter.  Just those words rolling by his eyes on the teleprompter. 
[03:07:00]  Just like Britney Spears pregnant will give you a behind-the-scenes look at her life now that blah, blah, blah.  I'm a sex addict.  I want to fucking go crazy with you.  I want to fucking go crazy with you.  Don't you love her as she's walking out the door. 
[03:07:30]  Don't you love her as she's walking out the door. 
[03:08:00]  You have no more messages.  That's not bad.  Do you know what the beauty is, that he's just trying to move on, and most of radio can't really play it, and yet on this show, not only are we not letting him move on, we are incessantly replaying it uncensored.  It's filthy. 
[03:08:30]  Replaying it over and over again.  Every time some fucking pest psychopath puts it with a song right onto the show, it comes.  Of course.  There it goes.  This has a little more shelf life in it.  How funny is it when you see these message board guys going to other message boards and just throwing in these little Pat O'Brien things that aren't dirty enough to get them in trouble?  Yeah.  You know, like, oh, those rights have to go, if you agree with me, just say yes.  Just say yes.  That was Mr. Sinister from PopeBag.com, it looks like.  I want to give him credit for that. 
[03:09:00]  I smell relapse with Pat O'Brien.  Of course.  Sean from Jersey.  Yeah.  40 days, too, is nothing, obviously.  Right, Jimmy?  I mean...  50 days.  It's a great start, but it's like, you can't go around tooting your own horn like you're cured after that.  It's like, you know...  The battle has just begun.  Yeah, it's a lifelong thing, man.  All right, let's go to Sean.  Sean?  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I just wanted to say how fucked up it was that he wanted to be so sincere and ask for everybody's forgiveness,  and he didn't even use his real voice. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, he still had to have that insider voice.  I'm Pat O'Brien.  God grant me the serenity.  The serenity.  And I want to beat off on your face.  Yeah, I have one more thing to say, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy, you used to go to Frank's in Manville?  Oh, Frank's Chicken House?  Yeah, it's not there anymore.  I went there, like, three or four times to see porn stars dance.  Yeah, that's what I used to say.  It's right across the street from my church.  Oh, okay.  I don't even remember where it was. 
[03:10:00]  I just remember, like, I was 19, 20, 15 years ago.  And we care why?  Good point.  Oh, point.  I don't know.  I heard him talking about it two days ago.  All right.  I'm punching out.  No, don't, sir.  We want to talk more about Frank's.  All right.  Let's go to Jerry.  Jerry, what's up?  Yeah, you know, I haven't been in the program for 21 years.  Spiritual Foundation is anonymity.  First thing he did is said, I'm Pat O'Brien.  That's not anonymous.  You know, this fucking idiot isn't going to make it two months.  I got to disagree with you on one thing.  Go for it.  Only because anonymity in relation to certain programs. 
[03:10:30]  He didn't break his anonymity as far as saying he's a member of any particular group.  To acknowledge you're an alcoholic publicly, to me, is acceptable, as long as you don't  associate yourself with any group that requests you maintain a level of public anonymity.  But there's so many groups out there.  Read your traditions, Jimmy.  I do.  Read your traditions.  I am completely.  You're suffering from cranial rectumitis here.  No, I'm not.  Read your traditions.  Hey, stupid.  Bill Wilson went to Rockefeller and asked for money.  He went and asked for public funds. 
[03:11:00]  He admitted he was an alcoholic publicly.  It wasn't a secret.  Bill Wilson didn't.  He didn't go on the fucking television or radio.  This guy.  He went to Rockefeller.  This guy's a carrier of alcoholism.  You want to drink at the top.  Dude, as long as you don't associate yourself with any particular 12-step program.  I already hung up.  You can admit your own personal thing.  I'm an alcoholic.  I'm Jim Norton.  I'm an alcoholic.  That's not an anonymity break, stupid.  Uh, hold on.  I've read the tradition.  That's why I don't say where I go. 
[03:11:30]  That's why I wear a mask.  I wear a superhero mask, wherever I am.  I gotta jump in again.  And, uh, Mr. Sinister is, uh, giving us an instant feedback here, saying,  From Whackbag, who is Popebag?  It was in his email.  What?  It was in his email.  You guys did a joke about Whackbag being Popebag when the Pope was coming around.  He put it as a joke in his email, so that's why I wrote it on there.  Oh, well, put it as a joke, and that's what's going to be written on there, you ass head.  Why is everyone uptight?  We don't know.  Mr. Sinister indeed.  Let's all get naked and hug in the woods.  Ooh. 
[03:12:00]  Let's start in the studio at 1101.  He's just saying, he used to it, you know, throw some leaves down.  Let's go to Gary.  Gary, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy, you luscious ball of yum-yums.  Thank you.  Hey, I agree.  Uh, this guy's going to relapse.  Even, uh, Michael J. Fox has said that, uh, his chances of recovery are shaky.  Punching out.  All right, a little shaky, dude.  That's not entirely bad.  You want to, you want to cricket him, but it was just, it was mean, and that kind of gives  it a little life. 
[03:12:30]  I actually pushed the cricket button down halfway, but I couldn't, I couldn't come in.  I'm like, ooh, it's right on the line there.  Not too bad.  All right.  Uh, let's try this thing out here.  Hey, it's me.  What's up, guy?  You are so fucking hot.  Who, me?  I don't want to beat you.  I know, I heard the conversation.  I don't want to say something like that.  I don't want to fuck you.  I think anyone should, yeah.  I don't want to go for it.  Yeah.  It's so fucking hot. 
[03:13:00]  You are fucking hot.  Why are we even, why are we even talking about the P word?  I don't want to fuck you.  I feel crazy with you.  I got to go, guys.  Yeah.  I don't want to fuck you.  I'm crazy with you.  Guys, I don't do that.  That's not my style, okay?  I don't do that crap.  That's why I, I just hung up the phone.  I was like, you know what?  I got to go.  Shut up, my God.  Shut up, my God.  Shut up, my God.  I just made it your style, but it ain't mine.  You call me a pussy, I'm hanging up.  You're a pussy. 
[03:13:30]  That's funny.  Hey, that had potential.  Tommy Lee called.  That had potential.  Picked up at the end.  It was a little slow to call.  That had potential, no?  You all right, Jimmy?  Yeah, I'm really annoyed at that.  I know, I know.  I'm fucking out with anonymity.  There's nothing that annoys me more than somebody pontificating me wrong.  I don't do it all the time.  Anthony, let's calm on Jimmy.  Yeah.  Calm on. 
[03:14:00]  Hey, man.  As long as you can tell me we're good.  Look, he just smiled.  He's smiling now.  That guy's heart's in the right place.  That's all that matters.  There you go.  Jimmy's back.  I have this.  I have living.  That's all I need.  Look, he's back.  He's back with the program.  He's not mad anymore.  How can you be when George O'Dowd is jumping out of tune?  He, he, he, he.  La, la, la.  Ba, ba, ba.  There we are.  Feeling better?  Who couldn't?  How do you not feel good with this?  You got to let the, what do you call it? 
[03:14:30]  The hook?  Yeah, yeah.  The post, whatever.  The hook, yeah.  He's coming.  He's coming.  Everybody.  He's coming.  Ba-dang.  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on my face.  You come and go  You come and go  All right, then he's face back.  Pretending I was a U.N. interpreter.  Good Lord.  And Kelsey's hour falling down makes everybody smile. 
[03:15:00]  See, Jimmy's laughing again.  How can you not be?  A little, uh...  Ah, Pat O'Brien's a good sort.  Ah, God bless him.  Man-a-nimity, sh-man-a-nimity.  All right, that Tommy Lee thing was from DJ New Style.  It was pretty good.  We got one from Manprick.  It's Pat O'Brien.  The Manprick or a fake Manprick?  I think actually Mavprick.  I'm sorry.  Oh.  Not Manprick.  I got confused with Manprick.  It's Mavprick.  It's Pat O'Brien and the Trainables audio.  You want to at least give it a shot?  All right.  This could be very wrong.  I don't know.  What's going on?  What's the matter, Hawk?  Hawk's not in a good mood. 
[03:15:30]  Hawk.  No.  He got yelled at.  He got reprimanded.  He got reprimanded.  No one likes that.  I hear...  No one likes being yelled at.  I know.  I thought maybe it was because he was wearing a shirt from 1981.  I hear Big Kev is pissed off.  Eric is bumming.  I just like that I am past the point in my life where I get yelled at anymore.  Dude, it's great.  I don't get yelled at.  I love not getting yelled at in my life anymore.  You know what the sad part is?  That only started two years ago.  For me, yeah.  For us.  Yeah.  You don't get yelled at anymore, right? 
[03:16:00]  Well, Jimmy was yelling at you.  That's when friends are yelling at each other.  That's different.  That's not...  That's not...  Not getting yelled at.  No, it's two people yelling at each other.  That's true.  Okay.  Okay.  That was just...  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough.  Fair enough, sir.  Good point.  Good point, sir.  Good point.  Arse whip.  Arse whip.  Arse whip.  That was just...  I don't get yelled at.  That was just good fashion fun.  Yeah.  I remember sitting...  Good old fashion fun.  ...and being yelled at by, like, even our buddy Ken Stevens.  Oh, that was the worst.  We'd be at the worst.  Why are you two doing this?  I could lose my goddamn job!  And you're sitting in your seat, all, like, slouched down, looking up at him, and all 
[03:16:30]  that's going through my head is, oh, my God, I'm a grown man, and I'm being yelled at.  I'm being yelled at.  You know what's going through my head?  I think he's going to have a heart attack.  Yeah.  I wasn't even listening to what he had to say.  I thought more so he'd have a nervous breakdown right there.  And, like, because there were a couple times he would be completely red-faced, and you'd  see tears welling up in his eyes.  He was so frustrated and upset with us that he would be on the verge of crying.  And we're sitting there going, oh, my God, we're adults. 
[03:17:00]  We're adults.  Does this ever end?  Do you ever reach a point in your life where you're not being yelled at by somebody else?  Yeah.  And now, I don't get yelled at.  And I love it.  I'm looking today.  I saw Eric get yelled at.  Ben is all pissed off, and he's wielding his iron fist.  I'll tell you something.  Ben has come a long way, man.  He's in charge.  That kid is in charge now.  He's a take-charge guy.  He has figured this whole thing out.  If he doesn't like something, he's going to let you know.  He shut us up in the middle of our hour.  Ben is like, just move on. 
[03:17:30]  Just move on.  Just move on.  And we did.  Shape up or ship out is what Ben said.  He certainly did.  And where's Martini Steve?  Because now we've got to get into this.  Because I guess Big Kev was all pissed off.  Why is he pissed off?  Everyone's angry.  Because Ben gave him a...  Ben gave a scolding.  A scolding.  Get Steve in here.  Big Kev doesn't even work here.  It's a privilege to be here.  I think that's why...  What happened, Steve?  Hey, bottle cap stomach.  Oh.  I think that's why Ben was angry.  Yes, sweetums.  What happened with Big Kev?  He's pissed off, too?  Where is he?  Pick that up, Steve.  Sorry.  Sorry.  He left. 
[03:18:00]  He was doing the yell under your breath.  Pretend I was a UN interpreter.  Oh, good Lord.  Oh, sorry.  A little Kelsey falling down.  Go ahead.  He was doing the whole yell under your breath, you know, across the room.  Kind of, don't fucking tell me that I don't help you.  Don't help.  Don't tell me that it's not wrong to get your picture.  Getting pictures where somebody doesn't fuck up getting guests.  So that kind of thing.  Oh, boy.  And, yeah, so then, you know, we...  I would love to get Ben in here for his response.  Absolutely. 
[03:18:30]  Ben won't come in.  Are you kidding me?  He jumped right the fuck up.  Oh, he's coming in.  This is the new Ben, boys and girls.  I love the new Ben.  I love the old Ben, too, though.  Ben's great now.  He's so pissed off.  He's not herky and jerky at all.  Look at it.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  Look how bad he looks.  Go ahead, Ben.  He's gone to behind his back.  First of all, it wasn't our guest.  Right.  Kev doesn't work here.  He shows up whenever there's a celebrity here.  And it's just...  It's not even our guest.  Right.  You know, there's people in town from Washington.  It just looks unprofessional.  We did make him...  We did make George Foreman look... 
[03:19:00]  You know, feel very uncomfortable.  It's not a guest.  And funny enough, as that happened, there was a mass email sent out from Washington to the whole  XM staff about this exact same thing.  Really?  What did it say?  Go grab it, Steve.  Go grab it.  Steve, get on it.  He's talked about being starstruck and being unprofessional.  And it is unprofessional.  Leaving your radio show for a picture.  That type of thing, right?  I can't argue.  All right.  Here's the mass email.  Does that have anything to do with the Robert Plank thing?  Let me see that.  I'll take a look at that.  Let's take a look at this.  Oh, maybe Jimmy's to blame for some of this.  This is coming out from Washington? 
[03:19:30]  Get used to it, folks.  This just in?  Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.  Dun-dun-dun-dun.  Breaking news.  Urgent policy reminder for all D.C. staff members.  But this applies here.  Importance high.  Look at this.  I love corporate crap.  They have an alert system, too?  There's an alert system over here.  Orange.  This importance...  Now, if it's low, do you even read it?  You just throw it away.  You look importance low.  This is high importance.  High importance memo.  As you can know, we have been doing some major changes to the building. 
[03:20:00]  Moving cubicles, painting walls, etc.  We don't want the appearance to suffer and request your assistance in keeping the building tidy and suitable for visiting guests.  We are fortunate that our headquarters welcomes distinguished visitors almost every day.  They come because we have created a dynamic and respectful environment where VIPs and artists can feel comfortable performing or conducting business free from being accosted, being gawked at, and being subject to what might be considered inappropriate behavior.  We need to remember that we are professionals in the entertainment industry and are not act starstruck. 
[03:20:30]  We have visitors coming later today, so please take some time to clean up both your personal space as well as your common areas nearby.  If you have a lot of trash, please call Gregory.  I guess he's the garbage guy.  And ask that it be picked up and carted away prior to the end of the day.  Thank you for your assistance.  I don't know.  That's Washington, but it's the same line.  Well, they must have the same problem down there where people come in, celebrities, and they come in to perform or do an interview. 
[03:21:00]  And the entire staff at D.C., which must really be fun, just watching those dorks run down the hallway, photos just flashing.  Let's clear something up right here.  Yes?  The next time I'm in D.C. and this is a celebrity, this is the new Jim Norton.  I'm getting another photo.  Oh, you're not even saying that this doesn't apply to you?  What doesn't?  The memo.  What memo?  You're not going to stop, Jimmy. 
[03:21:30]  Dan from Philly, what's up?  Yeah, hey, I want to tell Ben to stop being a freaking faggot.  You know, there's a problem handled a little after the show.  You leave Ben alone, Dan.  Yeah, leave the queer Ben alone.  We handle things on the air here.  Fucking faggot shirts.  We love him.  A bunch of faggot shirts.  You guys are talking shit to Ben for no reason.  Hey, big cock.  You fucking glasses.  We handle things.  North of Connecticut. 
[03:22:00]  Throwing things out, Adam.  Anything that doesn't mean anything.  It's a little phone shit.  Yeah.  Fucking watch the most time.  We handle things on the air here.  And what was funny was everyone was running out for the George Foreman pictures.  Yeah.  Danny still has a lot to learn.  It wasn't Nathaniel running in here.  Danny's like, oh, just go to break.  There's no one even on the air anymore.  And that's when you don't go to break.  Right.  You get to pick up on all that stuff.  Oh, Danny's throwing his arms up in disgust.  Who cares what Danny's doing?  Get him in here.  I'll fuck him. 
[03:22:30]  He's on his way in.  No, I think Danny had a little panic.  He was a little panicking.  Danny, what do we do?  That's how this show rolls, though.  You never know at any given moment what's going to happen.  Do I go to break?  Do I keep the show on?  Just keep the show on.  Just let it roll.  Of course you do.  If we could figure out how to do no commercials, we would do it.  If we could just take wireless mics to the bathroom so you could hear us just whistling  and peeing, we would do it.  We should work on that.  We should have microphones right over the urinals.  So you could just walk in.  Well, will the wireless mic work in the bathroom? 
[03:23:00]  And cameras.  We're getting one.  We're getting one very soon.  Yeah, probably will.  Oh, we have to test that out.  That would be hilarious.  Because the only reason we take breaks at this point is to take leaks.  Take leaks.  So all of a sudden it's like, oh, I'm taking a leak.  Then just take the mic with you.  Take it with you.  We'll keep our conversation going.  You can hear all the giggling that happens in the stalls as you're trying to take a leak  and urine starts coming onto your side.  If I'm in the stall and I see Jimmy's foot come underneath, Jimmy will start taking a leak.  And I'm standing there, and he'll put his foot underneath the stall and touch my foot with his. 
[03:23:30]  It's an uncomfortable thing.  Where the best is, I got Bob Kelly like this.  When they leave the stall door open, you just walk in and put your hand on someone's shoulder  while they're pissing and just talk to them.  Like, dude, we just got a little bit to eat.  Are you hungry?  He'll walk up behind you and just stand so uncomfortably close to your ass.  Some noise people.  The best is we lost that guy, and that was a good call.  Fella!  Ah, forget it.  I was just going to say, you're in a stall next to Jimmy, and all of a sudden you hear, 
[03:24:00]  pst, pst, pst.  I'm like, Jimmy, that's another creepy thing.  Hey, hey, hey.  Pst, pst, pst.  Jimmy, I do the show with you, what?  Pst, pst, pst, pst, pst, pst, pst, pst, pst, pst, pst, pst, pst.  Cigars and scotch from Black Bag.  What are you doing, what are you doing?  I have a quick Ben question and a what did I learn today.  All right.  Was Ben shaking his finger while he was yelling, or you couldn't tell?  He's holding someone. No, he's not. He's eating.  What else, buddy?  And I learned that George Foreman doesn't do the donkey punch.  No.  Oh, the ass joke. 
[03:24:30]  I should have punched out.  No, no, that's good.  You have a good egg.  What, Eric?  Come on, Hawk.  One of Jimmy's bathroom tricks.  He did it to me. It was in the stall.  It's all quiet.  All of a sudden, just this ton of water comes flying over the door.  And then he runs out and turns all the lights and blocks the door so you can't get out.  When did I throw water over you?  Threw water?  Yeah.  We were down in Soho looking at some photo gallery.  We stopped for a place for lunch.  The bathroom was on the downstairs. 
[03:25:00]  You happened to be in there when I walked in.  Oh, did I throw water from the sink or something?  You threw a whole bunch of water over the stall, locked the door, turned the lights, and ran out.  Jimmy's an animal.  He really is.  It's fun.  In men's rooms, Jimmy's just an animal.  He's a lot of fun.  He says inappropriate things.  And yesterday when I was leaving the studio, I was by the elevator,  and Jimmy walked out of the bathroom, and another gentleman walked out  and was walking toward the elevators, and I'm standing there.  And now I just know to run out of Jimmy's view.  Like I ran and hid behind a wall because I know if Jimmy saw me there and saw the guy walking toward me, 
[03:25:30]  he would have said something inappropriate and embarrassing.  So now I'm consciously making an effort to hide from Jimmy.  He's so embarrassing.  He'll steal the whole thing out.  That's really working.  Sweetie.  Yes.  Sweetie.  Baby.  Baby, don't be angry with me.  And then I'm just looking up at the elevator thing like I'm waiting for the elevator,  and he's talking to somebody else.  Right.  Name me.  Scout from Tennessee.  Hey, I was wondering, that song you were playing, what was the name of that? 
[03:26:00]  Is that Comma Comedian?  Wait.  It's coming.  Pretending I was a U.N. interpreter.  Oh, good Lord.  That's funny.  Comma Comedian.  Maybe we just get the clip.  Comma Coma Comedian.  That could be the new sound clip when someone bombs, just the good Lord part in the fall.  The fall.  Good Lord.  Good Lord.  All right.  Do you want to try this Trainables, Petal Bryant thing?  I haven't heard this one.  It could be very wrong.  Could be good.  Could be bad.  I like it. 
[03:26:30]  Daddy?  You're so fucking hot.  Okay.  I don't want to smell my car.  It's sticky, all right?  All right.  Jesus.  We made this one.  How old is that trainable?  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha!  Like 12.  I gotta get a bail on that one.  Holy shit!  I can't even go with that one.  But it's from the 50s.  She's old now.  Good point, Ant.  Good point.  There's no real connection. 
[03:27:00]  It's very funny.  Way to look at it.  It's sticky.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  That's the bit stopper right there.  Oof.  We could play...  I know we have to break.  I want to get Alan Alda in studio.  Huh?  I want Alan Alda to come talk to us someday.  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah, that'll happen like everybody else that's supposed to...  What happened to the wife of Will Ferrell in that new movie?  I don't care.  DJ Anal Lightbulb from Wackbag wants to know, 
[03:27:30]  What the fuck were Eric and Jimmy doing in a gallery in Soho?  Was that the rock and roll gallery?  Yeah, we were looking at the rock photos.  With the rock photos.  Oh, okay.  Ope was there, too.  I guess Eric and I stuck off to the bathroom.  It slipped away.  This shop in Soho is really cool, but it's just ridiculous the prices they want for these things.  The prior pictures are so nice.  They got a great Nirvana one, but it's like $1,500, and the size of the picture is like...  It's not...  It just doesn't seem worth it.  Beautiful color, Richard Pryor. 
[03:28:00]  Because they're prints.  There's only like 100 of them or something, supposedly.  That old gag.  He's shirtless in front of the American flag.  It's from like 1970 or 1967.  It's just great.  Really?  Yeah.  It's just phenomenal Pryor.  I wanted just like three of them.  I just wanted badly.  All right.  We'll break, regroup.  You want to try to get into the Tard blog?  Tard blog?  Yeah.  What is that?  I didn't even...  I haven't heard about this.  This is great.  What's the back story on this, Eric?  Anyone know?  It's an actual teacher that teaches like slow kids and stuff? 
[03:28:30]  I'm not 100% sure it's not a goof, but it seems pretty realistic.  Yeah.  It's a whole thing.  It's tard-blog.com.  It's written by a special education teacher.  This is a web...  It cannot be a special ed teacher.  This is a web...  No way.  Not calling it Tard blog.  No.  No one.  This is a web blog written by a real-life special education teacher.  Maybe someone else wrote it, and then this person took it and made a website.  Well, I will say... 
[03:29:00]  A real writer, Ridi Sped, has retired from teaching and is now pursuing other interests.  She may return to teaching at some point, and if so, she is always welcome to come back  and write again.  Her entire body of work is on the archive page, and if you are new here, I suggest you start  with Ridi's first story.  Which one is Ridi's first story?  And just read sequentially from there.  And basically, she just kind of wrote about her experiences at teaching these kids.  Well, you know something?  My girlfriend's sister and her husband both worked with retarded people upstate, and they've 
[03:29:30]  done nothing but talk badly about the retards, so perhaps this is quite true.  One story was that this guy, they gave him a laxative because he hadn't crapped in weeks,  and he just kept crapping his bed with logs that came out like one foot, two foot long, 
[03:30:00]  and this guy would have to clean up the crap, and then like an hour later, he'd come back  and there's like a three foot log in the bed, three feet of crap in the bed, and he'd clean  it up again.  And then right after he got done cleaning it up, another snake would come out of this  guy.  He cleared out his entire intestines of like two weeks worth of crap, and you know, I  guess you lose your whole why I got into this to help people thing, and it gets down to  that this retard is laying snake out of his ass for hours, and I got to clean it up. 
[03:30:30]  So, all right, maybe this could be true.  I just don't know if she'd use her real name and call it Tartblog.  Tartblog.  I don't think she has a connection to this.  Oh, she doesn't?  No, that's what I'm saying.  Oh, just copied and pasted all of it?  Yeah, which could still be false, whatever.  I don't know, sweetie.  Well, read one of these, Anthony.  The Field Trip.  I had to go to an art exhibit upstate at this school that these people were teaching 
[03:31:00]  at, and it was an art exhibit of like normal people and these retards that were put up at  this place, and I'm walking through the halls.  I had to go outside.  I couldn't stand there any longer.  Why?  Because they're drooling.  I mean profoundly retarded people, screaming, trying to show you crayon drawings of what  they did.  Like, Jimmy smiled and tilted his head like, oh, that's sweet.  I don't know.  That's just it.  Bob Kelly's crying again. 
[03:31:30]  And then I went outside.  I had to go outside.  I couldn't take it anymore.  So, I went outside, and I'm just kind of standing out by the sidewalk, and there was a reflector  on this pole, and the reflector was on a spring.  So, I'm standing there, and I'm bored shitless, so I was flinging the reflector on the spring  and watching and trying to figure out how much it would oscillate depending on how long  the spring was, and just kind of running through something in my mind. 
[03:32:00]  Doing physics tests.  Just not even, just kind of curious as to the motion of it and, you know, the length of  the spring and the weight of the reflector on top of it, and just things like that.  Just kind of running it through my head.  Distance from the sun and the moon's gravitation.  Exactly.  I understand, yeah.  Sure.  But I'm looking at it, and I'm flicking the spring, and a car pulled up another bunch of  guests to the exhibit, and they walked past me as I'm doing this, and the guy goes,  hello, good morning to me, I swear to God, I swear to God, and I turned and went, hey, 
[03:32:30]  how you doing?  Thought I was just a retard flinging a spring with a reflector on it.  Well.  I was running through calculations in my head.  Were you nice if they showed you the pictures?  Yeah.  No, I couldn't take it.  One guy, they scared the crap out of me.  Oh, sticky fingers and stringy, greasy hair, and one girl couldn't talk, and she's just 
[03:33:00]  holding this mess.  Ooh, that's a pretty picture.  No, it isn't.  You gotta be honest.  That doesn't look like anything.  That stinks.  You're awful, and you're stupid.  Bob from New Jersey.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, hello.  Sped is what they call a special ed student.  It's not written by a real person.  You said the author's last name is Sped.  Sped?  Oh, special ed.  What was the name of the author? 
[03:33:30]  The real author, though, is Sped.  Yeah.  Reedy Sped is special ed.  Yeah.  Code name.  It's not a real site.  It's not written by a real person.  No, no, no, no, no, but Reedy Sped might be just the fake name of the person who posted  it.  What's supposed to be?  A pseudonym.  What's the?  What's the original writer, Reedy Sped.  Oh, he's right.  Okay, I'm sorry.  So maybe they're just either goofing with us, or they're changing the name to protect  the innocent.  I don't know.  Well, let's read one, and we'll be the judge here. 
[03:34:00]  Number five.  The field trip?  That's the one I have?  Yeah.  Okay.  On our field trip this morning, one of the re-tees, is that what they call them?  Retards?  Re-tees?  Re-tees.  One of the re-tees spotted a bird nest in a big bush.  The whole gang tweeted, I cleared some branches out so the kids could take a closer look.  There was one little egg in the nest.  The kids were in awe, especially when Jamal, my little Sudanese SBD child. 
[03:34:30]  What's an SBD child?  Sort of brain damaged?  Could it be that?  Something brain damaged?  Sudanese is like from Sudan.  Yeah, but then SBD.  Something brain damaged, I would think.  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah.  Severe.  Child asked if he could touch the egg.  Severely brain damaged?  I'm guessing.  Asked if he could touch the egg.  I let him.  He picks the egg up out of the basket and crushes it in his hand. 
[03:35:00]  At this, some kids are crying.  Others are wanting to see the inside.  Jamal fucking licks the shit out of his fucking hand, then throws the shell on the ground and  smashes it with his feet.  This is only one of the many things that occurred today.  I'm in my room waiting for my 11 o'clock group to show up for math.  It's 1109.  I begin to wonder where they are.  Then I remind myself that they're retarded and stop wondering. 
[03:35:30]  Put the fucking bird egg in the basket.  Put the bird egg in the basket.  I'm going to show you what chromosomes are, lady.  Well, how about the post-field trip, Anthony?  It licks the egg off its hand.  It does this whenever it's told.  The post-field trip?  Hey, wait.  Big Kev wants in.  Uh-oh.  Big Kev.  Yeah.  Hi, sweetie.  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  What's going on?  I was just calling to explain myself, as it were. 
[03:36:00]  I just lost my temper, that's all, and that's it.  The reason I've been coming in with stuff is I've been helping out Eric with this charity  project thing that we've been doing, and that's it.  Ben's got it wrong.  Ben's giggling like crazy in the office.  Yeah, I know he is.  Well, you guys should discuss this.  I mean, Ben should definitely, I think, come in and discuss it.  Why not?  I want to see the new Ben in action. 
[03:36:30]  Ben?  Oh, here comes Ben.  Let's talk about it.  Hold on, Kev.  All right.  Kev does help out behind the scenes with some stuff.  Yeah, we know that.  He does.  He's got a Shatner.  He gets us guests and goes to those silly sci-fi conventions and takes a phone.  All right, here comes Ben, the executive producer of the Opie and Anthony program.  Ben, Big Kev's on the line.  I know.  Kev doesn't work here.  Kev just has a building ID somehow and just shows up.  He doesn't tell anybody.  I had no idea he was coming in.  There's people in town from Washington interviewing George Foreman. 
[03:37:00]  He looks unprofessional.  And, you know, everybody's running around, so.  But what did I do there except what I was asked to do?  You never talked to me.  I didn't even know you were fucking coming in.  I talked to Eric.  Well, Eric never told me.  Eric, comment.  Eric, comment.  Hawk.  Comment, Eric.  I couldn't get the grills.  Kevin said he could get a good deal on the grills.  He got the grills for me.  He said, I'm going to bring them in.  I said, okay.  And left it at that.  That's it.  Oh, so Kev's the one that brought the grills today.  Yeah.  I held the mic when I was asked to hold the mic. 
[03:37:30]  That's it.  That's all I did.  Uh-oh.  Problem?  No, I didn't step in and pose for a picture.  One might have been snapped at me when I was holding the mic, but I didn't step in there.  I love this stuff.  I love when it's not me.  Well, that's an interesting point Kev's making.  Ben makes a good point.  Kev makes a good point.  I said they should...  I don't have any problem.  I just want to, you know, get the record clear that I'm, you know, I'm not haunting around  there for no reason.  Dude.  All right. 
[03:38:00]  It just, today it just looked very, it just didn't look, you know, it would be one thing  if it's our guest.  It's not our guest.  You know, Ben and people in town, you know, it just looks bad.  You know, Ricky's grabbing a photo.  It's just...  I got to help.  I got to help.  I'm not Ricky.  Yeah, but you don't work here either, Kevin.  You're not even an intern.  You're absolutely right.  Right.  You really have a building ID?  He has a building...  He got a building ID somehow.  Kevin?  When we were first getting building IDs, I was put on the list.  All right.  I don't know why. 
[03:38:30]  I'll turn it in if it bothers you that much, Ben.  I got to help Ben out.  I mean...  It doesn't bother me.  The problem is you're not an employee, so say you come in here, which I know you wouldn't,  but if you did come in here, you know, on a Saturday and stole a bunch of equipment  or, you know, the security issues...  Well, there's security tapes, and I'm sure they have a way of telling you...  That's not the point.  You shouldn't have a building ID if you're not an employee.  It should be like anyone else.  I'll be happy to turn it in to you the next time I come in.  Here's the deal.  I got to stick up for Ben.  Ben's put in a really bad situation when that happens because we all just really went after 
[03:39:00]  George Foreman to get our pictures and then shake his hand and meet him and, you know...  And Ben is the one that gets shit after the mics go off and he goes back to his office and  he gets the calls from Washington.  Why didn't you control the situation?  So, you know, Ben has to do what he's got to do.  Absolutely.  I totally agree.  All right.  So, is it all cleared up?  Very good.  I'm fine.  All right.  Why don't you guys give each other a positive affirmation?  Ben, I think you're a fine producer.  Shut up. 
[03:39:30]  Shut up, Jim.  Kevin gave you a positive affirmation.  Thank you, Kev.  You're a fine bringer in of...  Of things.  Of low-up pools.  Thank you.  I'm fine with that.  All right.  We look forward to the next C-list celebrity you get us.  Okay, like Shatner, the C-list celebrity.  That was one time, bro.  Shatner was good.  You know what?  I'll give him credit.  I'll give him credit there.  Kevin Smith.  You don't want to give him credit.  All right.  Two times.  Two times.  That's good.  What have you done for us lately, though? 
[03:40:00]  Okay, you're right.  Do you really want to get into that?  Yeah, go ahead.  No, you don't want to get into that.  I had plenty of people lined up, and I had the legs taken out from under me, and you know it.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What do you mean?  Whoa, hey.  I don't know this.  Some people lined up for the show, and I was told, hey, you know, D.C. says this and  that, and so on and so forth, and that was the end of it.  Was there a problem with Kev booking guests for the show on his own time?  Write it down, Eric.  Was there a problem?  Wasn't there something involving the South Park guys, Matt and Trey? 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, there was something involving them.  I had them all lined up.  I'm saying if Kev can get anybody for the show, why would Washington not want him to do that?  I'm lost.  I don't know.  Especially some of the guests.  I had plenty of people lined up, and the legs were just taken out.  Kev, Kev, so you had Matt and Trey lined up.  Yeah.  What transpired that that didn't go on?  Well, someone told me, I don't remember who exactly told me, but somebody told me that 
[03:41:00]  feathers were ruffled in D.C. because I had contacted somebody who I know on the inside  there and was like, hey, we'd really like to have them on because, you know, they're  going to be in town.  Apparently, D.C. feathers got ruffled because I'm not an employee and so on.  But Kev, that's not what would have happened.  Obviously, you called someone from Matt and Trey's camp, and then Matt and Trey was like,  their camp was like, what is this about? 
[03:41:30]  And probably called Washington to say, why is this guy calling us to try to get Matt and  Trey on a radio show?  Absolutely not what happened.  Then what happened?  Absolutely not.  I talked to somebody who I know there.  So why would it get to Washington at that point?  Because it's XM, they probably called to confirm or to confirm the show and things of that  nature.  And when they were like, when D.C. was like, hey, Kev, who the hell is Big Kev?  Well, I could see where there could be some confusion. 
[03:42:00]  And I understand the reason why it was said, all right, you know, if you have any leads,  pitch them off to somebody and so on and so forth.  Well, Kev, you've got to tell us who talked.  You've got to remember who talked to you.  It wasn't just a voice.  I can't remember.  But I have spoken to Ben and Steve about the issue.  And I said, look, if I have anything significant, then I'll pass it off to you guys.  And that's what happened with Shatner.  Your guys, your highly paid people there who Shatner said no to. 
[03:42:30]  And he said yes to me.  Now, wait a minute.  Now, did you get a phone call or did somebody who you can't remember say something face to  face?  So you're trying to say you're better than the guys we have.  Well, I'm trying to say that I can do the job.  You know, I'm not saying I'm better than anybody.  No, you were trying to throw some people under the bus there, Kev.  No, I'm not.  Let's be honest.  No, I'm not.  No, I'm not.  You said the highly paid people couldn't get it done, but I could.  No, that's not.  They couldn't get it done, and I could.  I think he's talking about the Booker.  The Booker, not Ben.  The Booker? 
[03:43:00]  Are you talking about the Booker?  I'm talking about the Booker.  I'm not talking about anybody else.  All right.  Well, because I'm going to get defensive if you start talking about these guys like that.  Oh, I certainly wouldn't talk about my friends that way.  All right.  At least we figured that out.  Kev, we have no, you know, if Kev can help out, there's no anybody that can help out.  Jim helps out with comedians.  Anybody.  It's a team effort.  I like to get some of the Linda Blair things and some of those reach from the sci-fi things.  Kev knows that.  If Kev can bring that to the show, then he should absolutely be able to.  But I want to know who can, Kev, if you can think of it, man, I want to know who told 
[03:43:30]  you that that was wrong, that you got Matt and Trey.  That specifically, they are monster guests.  I would love to know.  Yeah, I'm not, I don't know.  Something sounds fishy there.  Because why wouldn't we?  Something fishy.  Something fishy.  Because of course they would want Matt and Trey on our show.  Oh, okay.  The one thing they want in Washington is a lot more guests on this program, so, you know.  I understand that.  But here's the thing I've heard.  Nobody wants Kev representing the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:44:00]  And when he calls these guests, that's what they told him.  Oh, we out of time?  No, that's fine.  Maybe Monday we'll solve this.  Let's talk about it.  Program complete. </pre>
