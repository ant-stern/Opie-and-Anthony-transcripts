<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The December 16th, 1999, Opie and Anthony Show broadcast revolved around their infamous "homeless shopping spree" at the Short Hills Mall in New Jersey.  The show began with preparations for the event, including Joey from Paisano's delivering fried raviolis (exclusively for Anthony).  Several homeless individuals, collected from various locations including shelters and Washington Square Park, were interviewed in the studio.  These interviews included Gray Wolf, a Native American flute player, and Ziggy (later revealed to be Bobby), a particularly disheveled individual who left a lingering strong odor in the studio, recounting his life experiences and injuries.  The initial plan to "grim up" the participants was abandoned. Each homeless person received $102 and additional, sometimes inappropriate, prize packages (including Mad Dog 2020 and a brick). Listeners frantically called in to guess the mall's location, reporting police presence at various malls.

The bus carrying the homeless individuals, accompanied by Rick, departed, with the hosts teasing the mall's identity throughout the broadcast.  Numerous listener calls followed the bus's journey, offering updates and varied reactionsâ€”ranging from support to outrage (with one caller, Christy, eliciting an obscene response from a host).  Comedian Jay Moore, who was initially invited but couldn't make it due to a scheduling conflict with his producer (leading to a humorous, expletive-filled exchange with the hosts), eventually joined the show.  The hosts also previewed future segments, including a "lesbian for a day" segment and discussed a previous arrest.

Upon arrival at Short Hills Mall, the broadcast depicted a chaotic scene with large crowds, confrontations between participants and mall patrons/staff, and a significant security presence.  The hosts urged the homeless participants to enter quickly to avoid arrest.  Callers described the interactions at various stores (Neiman Marcus, Foot Locker, Versace, Victoria's Secret, Macy's, FAO Schwartz, Bloomingdale's), highlighting the contrast between the affluent shoppers and the participants, and recounted numerous humorous and tense exchanges.  One caller, Marco, engaged in a sexually suggestive conversation with Jay Moore.  The broadcast also included detailed and graphic descriptions of a previous arrest of the hosts.  The chaotic scenes at the mall involved yelling, chanting ("Bring back action!", "Spaz is gay!"), and confrontations with mall security and a purported state trooper who threatened to send a SWAT team.  Joe's Bar and Grill offered free food.  A caller who claimed to know Ziggy stated that Ziggy believed he wrote "Mr. Sandman."  Jay Moore shared anecdotes from his comedic career, including a disastrous appearance on *Comics Come Home*.

Further updates from Rick and Ben (following in the FM Talk van) detailed events on the bus, including Virginia flashing people and most of the participants sleeping.  A recurring comedic element involved listener calls using the phrase "What's that, a train?", often preceding an incident.  Mr. Sullivan threatened to sue.  The group eventually obtained photos with Santa Claus.  The show concluded with the bus being moved from a fire lane, and the addition of a new homeless woman to the group, along with ongoing reactions from mall staff and law enforcement.  The hosts discussed plans for a future party, the upcoming appearance of their mothers and Sal,  and teased future segments featuring a Russian model for a "lesbian for a day" bit and a 73-year-old woman intending to get naked on air.  The broadcast was rife with vulgar language throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We are here.  We are live.  Believe it or not, it's Opie and Anthony.  Wow, what the hell time is it?  I just woke up.  We put down the remote control.  We got off the computer.  We turned off the porno.  We are live on this fine Thursday, December 16th, 1999, Anthony.  A very exciting day for the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  Today, as you know, is the big day.  Today, we are sending a busload of homeless people to one of the fine malls in Jersey to do some Christmas shopping, Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Uh-huh.  Each one of our homeless people will receive $102 to spend any way they like at this fine mall in Jersey.  Oh, there's the mall.  We know for sure now.  Very good.  Very good.  When are we going to tell people what mall it is?  When we get real close?  Yeah, I figure we're about 15, 20 minutes away.  All right, because we've got to give our faithful listeners a chance to, you know, join us at the mall to have some fun. 
[00:01:00]  Right.  You know?  But, yeah, they got, what, 102 minutes to spend the $102, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  And, man, we are excited.  We've got the bus outside.  The homeless people are gathering outside our studio as we speak.  And I've got to say, they are better dressed than you and I.  I know.  How did that happen?  That is the finest bunch of homeless people I've ever seen.  I think the shelter kind of made sure they dressed up for today.  Really?  Yeah.  And I'm embarrassed because they look better than we do. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  I saw, like, suits and stuff out there.  You've got to mess them up a little bit.  Really?  Oh, my God.  I'm rolling around in the park or something.  Get some, like, I don't know, charcoal and get their faces all messed up.  Oh, you want them in blackface, though?  Well, not necessarily blackface, just, you know, grimed up a little bit.  You know?  We want them all scabby and stuff.  Jeez, man.  Well, we do, right? 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Their hot sandwiches just arrived, too.  Okay.  Well, we've got the homeless people from the shelter.  Yep.  Ben, as we speak, is on a bus gathering up the rest of them, the ones that sleep on  the street, like, you know, around Washington Square Park and stuff.  Yeah.  And supposedly those guys are the real treats.  Those are like the cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  So we're just waiting for Ben to come back with the other homeless people, and we're going  to start the festivities.  Joey!  Joey. 
[00:02:30]  Joey from Paisano in the studio.  What do you got me here, Joe?  Wait, you didn't get me any food because I haven't seen you lately?  You don't come in and see me.  He doesn't.  So he's just a ghost, right?  The guy in the other side.  Come on.  Oh, big skin of fried raviolis.  What about me?  Holy cow!  I see you race around here.  You don't come by and see him kiss the ring every so often.  You don't get squashed.  Did I disrespect you, Joey?  I don't know.  Ah, he's serious.  A little bit. 
[00:03:00]  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Oh, Joey.  Oh, you roll, man.  And you're going to share some of that fine Paisano?  Hell no.  You get nothing, man.  Son of a bitch.  Mmm.  Can I have some?  Oh, my ravioli.  I always knew that Anthony was your favorite, you bastard.  Hey, he's Italian.  Come on.  I understand, man.  I understand, man.  I wasn't going to try to attempt to compete for your friendship.  You've got to stop by more often, man. 
[00:03:30]  Come in.  Show your face.  That's all.  Bitchy.  Come on.  You really didn't bring me any food?  Now I'm hurt.  I mean, it's all fun and games, but now I'm deeply hurt.  Oh, these things are great.  This is awesome.  Come on.  Where's my food?  It's like Spicoli when everyone's eating a pizza.  Yeah, yeah.  Spicoli just kind of looks over.  Come on, man.  What's up with that?  You'll get nothing and like it.  All right.  It's our time. 
[00:04:00]  Where was I?  Oh, so Ben's getting the rest of the homeless people.  They're eating as we speak outside, right?  Outside the studio?  Yeah.  God, put down the paisano food for a minute.  Also, fried raviolis.  Like the best friggin' thing.  It's like crack.  I swear to God.  Oh, man.  All right.  So, also the homeless people get a homeless prize package,  courtesy of us at FM Talk, Anthony.  Their prizes include a wool blanket, a wool hat, 
[00:04:30]  a pair of socks, hot sandwich, a pair of gloves, Anthony.  Keep you warm.  Some of the prizes that were not approved by the fine management of FM Talk,  tickets to the Rosie O'Donnell Show, a brick, a cardboard box,  half a bologna sandwich, a bottle of Mad Dog 2020,  a bag of cans, and a shopping cart.  Wow.  We were not allowed to put those in the prize package.  I can definitely see why.  The Rosie Show wouldn't give us tickets.  Oh, really?  Well, we're ready to go.  That bitch.  We are just about ready to go.  I think we're going to talk to some of the homeless people before we go, right? 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  And, look, everyone's on the phone lines begging to find out what mall we're going to.  Seth, what's going on?  Yeah, what's going on?  Listen, I listen to you guys all the time.  I'm here in Jersey.  I actually have Christmas presents for you, too.  Oh, cool.  Britney Spears related.  And I have a little appointment to go to today, but I definitely need to know,  maybe when you take me off the air, what mall you guys are going to be at.  I can't listen for the next hour, but I want to do a little shopping, and I'm here in Jersey,  and I want to see some homeless people causing some mayhem. 
[00:05:30]  I think if everything goes as planned, we'll tell everyone the mall by 4 o'clock.  4 o'clock?  Yeah, by 4 o'clock.  It might be sooner.  It just depends when they're close, if they don't hit traffic and all that.  I recommend Garden State Plaza.  It's right off of the bridge.  All right.  You can take Route 4 right there.  Okay.  Route 17.  Garden State Plaza.  There's going to be a lot of people that are nice.  And you get a lot of, like, the rich upper class that scare the crap out of them.  All right, Seth.  Well, I got the name of the mall in front of me, and I can't tell you which one at this time. 
[00:06:00]  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Ant is not even in on the show today because of Joey.  Thanks, Joey.  Jay, what?  How's it going, Owen?  Hey, what's up, guys?  You might as well have just handed him a crack pipe.  Rick wants some more.  Rick wants some more.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Listen, I heard you guys mention Washington Square Park over there.  Yeah.  Hey, back in my day, I used to go there and get my mescaline, you know what I'm saying?  Well, all I know is this.  My first ship over, I seen those bombs out there, and I was scared to death of them. 
[00:06:30]  I was saying, man, these guys are going to kill me.  Well, a few of those guys are coming with us today.  You know what, though?  On the homeless shopping spree.  The funny thing, I was just telling the staffs on hold.  I said, man, when I was coming out all tripping and bugging, they were looking like Barney.  They were looking like Ronald McDonald.  Man, they actually look better.  I wanted to go dance with those guys.  There you go.  It's going to be a lot of fun today.  Awesome, guys.  I wish you guys all luck in the world.  The hell with the Jersey Troopers, you know?  All right.  Thank you.  Get the show going, guys.  Bye.  All right.  I have an announcement to make.  First restaurant to bring me food becomes my favorite restaurant in New York. 
[00:07:00]  First restaurant to bring the Oaks to some food becomes his favorite restaurant.  Is that it?  It's come down to that, Anthony.  That's terrible, Oaks.  Yeah, it's terrible.  Joey's right here.  It's terrible as you stuff your face.  You son of a bitch.  I'm going to bring him another wet tuna sandwich.  All right.  Ah, yeah.  Tony, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going?  All right.  Listen, I got about eight cars ready to go, and I want to know what time the homeless caravan's leaving. 
[00:07:30]  Where's your caravan right now?  We are just about to go into the Midtown Tunnel.  Are you really?  Yeah.  Didn't we tell people that they could follow our bus if they get to 57th and 7th?  All right.  We're going to leave by 3 o'clock.  By 3 o'clock.  All right.  And also, I wanted to know, is there any way you guys could make a stop-up and drop these guys off at my ex-wife's house for a while?  How much money you got?  We'll do that.  I got plenty.  All right, man.  Thank you. 
[00:08:00]  Also, on the bus, we're going to have the homeless people singing Christmas carols and stuff.  Yeah.  Some of the songs we picked out are just brutal, though.  Who picked out All I Want for Christmas is My Two Front Teeth?  I mean, that's me.  That's a little harsh.  That's a little harsh.  I can't wait to hear their rendition of Feliz Navidad.  All right.  Well, Steve from the unofficial website is here.  He's going to be documenting the whole thing on video.  Yes, he's got his camera with him.  So we can get some clips on the unofficial website.  Sick Boy is here from xwrestling.com to help out Steve, and it's going to be a lot of fun. 
[00:08:30]  He's going to assist.  First, Channel 7 at a mall in Jersey.  Eric, what's going on?  Hey, you got some news crews out here, man.  At what mall?  Bridgewater Commons.  All right.  Channel 7's here.  I heard tell that there was Channel 2 at another one.  No, it's funny.  No one knows exactly what mall we're going to yet.  Oh, of course not.  They're all just sent out all over the place, assuming they know where we're going. 
[00:09:00]  Honestly, there's only five people that know what mall we're going to.  And three of them are in this studio right now.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  All right.  Bye.  You're funny.  All right.  We've got to take a quick break, and then we'll talk to some of the homeless people that  are very excited to go on the homeless shopping spree.  All right, Anthony?  Yes.  We have a bunch of our homeless people getting filled up on some fine food, Anthony.  Yes.  Thanks to Joey from Paisano for helping us out with food today. 
[00:09:30]  And everyone is trying to figure out what mall we're going to.  I know.  The bus is going to leave by 3 o'clock, I believe.  And we're going to start the festivities.  But let's go to the phones.  Everyone's freaking out.  Bobby, what's up?  You're next on FM Park.  Yeah, guys, you've got a lot of cops over here at Mumbo Park Mall in Jersey waiting  for you guys.  Oh, yeah?  You guys are going to be raising a lot of hell if you guys come here.  The mall is packed.  They don't know what to do if you guys come here.  Why are the cops all over the place?  We're trying to do a nice thing this holiday season. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, we know.  I know you guys are trying to do a good thing for these guys, but these cops don't want  to see you guys anywhere near here.  It's going to make for some great radio today, but the fact is we're doing something very,  very nice for a bunch of people this holiday season, giving them a bunch of money and a  bunch of stuff that they desperately need.  All right, Bobby, thank you.  No problem, guys.  All right, bye.  Bye.  John, what's going on?  John?  Yeah, what's going on, fellas?  What's up?  We're at the Short Hills Mall.  It's like a trooper jamboree on Route 24.  You guys have to be six, seven troopers on Route 24 and about ten police guards in the 
[00:10:30]  parking lot.  We're circling around right by Nordstrom right now.  You're a cop?  No, no, no.  I'm just down here doing some Christmas shopping and hopefully running it some more.  I'm homeless.  Well, you'll have to wait and see.  No, no.  We can't tell people where we're going yet.  I understand, but drive slow, man.  You can't believe the amount of cops.  All right, thank you.  Be good, fellas.  Bye.  All right, we got a couple of our guys in the studio.  What's up, man?  What's your name?  Tom.  Hey, Tom.  And who else we got?  Jose.  Jose, what's going on?  How you doing? 
[00:11:00]  You guys are both homeless?  Yes, sir.  Living in a shelter?  Yes.  Shelter program.  How long have you been homeless?  I've been in the program about 80 days now.  80 days?  Yeah.  What happened to you that you ended up in a shelter?  Were you living on the street for a while?  No, I was living with friends back and forth and using too much cocaine, so I had a problem,  so I had to take care of it.  You're still using now?  No.  No?  No.  Trying to clean up and get your life together?  I am cleaning up again.  All right.  And Jose, what's your deal?  I drink and sleep in the street, too. 
[00:11:30]  You sleep in the street?  Yeah, for two years and a half.  Two and a half years and now you're in the shelter?  Yeah.  Trying to get something going?  Yeah, I got to finish my school and got to suck my life.  Now, what happened to you that you ended up on the street?  Um, drink.  A lot of tequila?  A lot of tequila.  Look at me.  They ate tequila.  Tequila.  Looks like they feed you pretty good in the shelter, though, huh?  They're taking care of you guys in the shelter, though? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, great program, man.  They do good over there.  All right, so we got a guy that used to do a lot of coke and another guy that likes tequila.  So, are you guys excited for your homeless shopping spree?  Sure.  All right, you're enjoying the food out there?  Yeah, the food.  We got free food for you.  We're going to give you guys some stuff that you desperately need.  And, of course, the $102 that you can spend any way you want when you get to that mall.  What could you get?  Like a half gram for that?  $120?  How much?  $2?  No, I probably get about $8,4 for $102.  Really? 
[00:12:30]  Wow.  How times have changed.  $8,4.  Well, all right.  We might want some drug dealers to show up at the mall that we're going to.  You might be able to make some quick cash before they get into the mall, Anthony.  And then a little Jose Cuervo.  Man, get the guy some tequila.  Oh, man.  Come on.  We can't put him out there.  Don't be.  Don't do that to the guy.  Come on.  Get him some tequila.  When was the last time you had a drink, Jose?  I got it through 60 days in the program. 
[00:13:00]  50-something days.  Yeah?  60-something days?  You can't be blowing that.  Are you guys pals?  I met him in the program and, you know, we became kind of tight.  Right.  Okay.  Now, everybody becomes kind of tight.  You know what I'm saying?  Right.  All right.  Well, we want you guys to have fun today, without a doubt.  Cool.  And, you know, oh, my God.  Look at some of the...  Holy cow.  Oh, my God.  You guys are normal compared to what I just saw out the door.  And this guy abuses cocaine. 
[00:13:30]  This guy...  Security.  Building security.  Security.  Really, huh?  Security.  You guys think your lives are bad.  You can check out what's going on outside of the door.  All right, man.  This guy's a fox.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Well, Rick, why don't we get these guys out?  I'm going to bring a couple more guys.  You guys will be on the radio all day.  We're going to be broadcasting from the boss and everything.  So, enjoy yourselves today, okay? 
[00:14:00]  Go get some more food.  Thank you.  I'm going to try to get you some tequila, bro.  Come on, man.  Okay.  You don't need tequila.  You're terrible.  You're trying to knock him off the wagon.  This guy's trying to overcome his problem that he has.  Get his life back together.  You're offering him the demon that brought him down to where he is.  God, I hope these guys don't have weapons, man.  I swear to God.  Did you see just what walked in there?  No, I wasn't able to see that.  All right.  Let's bring a couple more guys in here.  Rick is trying to figure out who's safe to bring into the studio.  Oh, my God. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, boy.  Yeah, Denise is pissed at you, Joey.  Uh, Denise.  Yes.  What's up?  I'm calling with some sympathy for Opie.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm a friend of Joey, so I feel bad that he didn't bring him any food, and I want to know why.  He's making a statement.  I haven't been there in three months, so he's making a statement.  Oh, well, you've got to tell Joey that Spice is on the phone.  Who's on the phone?  Spice, Spice is on the phone, and she says that you've got to bring Opie food.  He usually does, but... 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, who's Spiff?  Who's Spiff or Stiff?  Denise?  Yes.  Who's the Spiff or Stiff guy?  Spiff with a P. He's my husband.  You know what's Spiff, Joey?  No.  Joey says he doesn't know any Spiffs.  Tom Tommy.  He knows a bunch of Spiffs, but...  Okay.  Oh, come on.  Oh, that's terrible.  What's up?  All right, now he knows you.  How's the baby?  She's good.  She's good.  I'm a new camper in Opie food.  His laugh makes me die. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, he used to be my friend.  He used to be me, and now he doesn't come back.  Oh, come on.  Give poor Opie a break.  He's a big time now.  He doesn't stop that.  Denise, it's because I'm not, you know, Italian.  I always knew it.  Oh, come on.  I had nothing to do with it.  I always knew it.  You just don't come down and say hi to him.  I've got to go find a corned beef restaurant, man.  No, no, no.  You guys have got to come down to my husband's bar.  He'll feed you.  All right, Denise.  Thank you for calling and sticking up for me.  It's very rare when someone sticks up for me.  Thank you. 
[00:16:00]  Sean, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  I'm taking off of work to see these guys running around the mall.  All right.  And I had a question.  Are you going to booze these boys up before they get there, or what?  They do that themselves.  I take the fifth.  I take the fifth.  I take the fifth.  I take the fifth.  All right.  I think the one guy who, you know, abuses cocaine, he's not going to be doing any lines  today, but I'm sure he's dying for a drink, so.  Well, I'm going to bring him a bottle of Timbuka for whoever wants it.  All right.  Thank you, Sean.  All right, bro.  All right.  Rick, let's bring in a couple more.  Bring in a couple of guys that Ben just found, because this is awesome. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, my God.  Ben has been spending weeks trying to find the best homeless people.  Ben!  Come on in here, man.  What's up, man?  Hey.  Hey, what's your name?  My name is Gray Wolf.  Gray Wolf?  Gray Wolf.  I like that name.  Where did you get that name from?  It's from the Indian community house.  It's an Indian name.  Right on.  Now, what?  From the Chiafow Apaches.  Now, where do you live?  Right now, I was living in New York here with my ex-old lady and my child, Rick. 
[00:17:00]  I found out that she was cheating on me, so I threw myself on the street.  Yeah, he leaves me for lunch.  And I left.  All right.  Are you...  Where is he living?  Like, Washington Square Park area?  I'm living here in the area of 14th Street and Avenue 8th Avenue.  Between 14th Street and 40th Street?  Anywhere in there?  No, no.  No, 14th and 8th.  All right.  Between there and 7th Avenue and Christopher Street. 
[00:17:30]  Do you know what's going on today?  He's making a program about homeless people, isn't he?  We're taking care of you.  We're going to give you $102 to spend at a mall today.  A fine mall in Jersey.  We're feeding you guys.  But I prefer to use that instead of going to Jersey and doing this.  I prefer to just try to get something of five-length life for me.  For Christmas, right?  Yeah.  Well, that's why we're bringing you to the mall so you can get that Christmas gift.  Okay.  All right.  It's going to be a great day. 
[00:18:00]  It's like a field trip.  Yeah.  We're going to have fun on the bus.  We're giving you some, we're giving you like a hat, a blanket.  What else?  Socks.  Feeding you.  Gloves.  And $102 spending money.  All right.  Go and grab some presents or something.  Well, Gray Wolf, welcome to FM Talk.  We're going to be loading the bus very soon.  Who's this guy?  Is that the peace pipe?  What do you got there?  This is a flute.  He's got a flute.  Oh, can you play the flute for us? 
[00:18:30]  This is Gray Wolf.  Native American Indian music.  Yeah.  You can lower the mic.  Maybe someone lower the mic for Gray Wolf there.  Wow.  Must be like in desert.  Arizona. 
[00:19:00]  Wow.  Nice.  Great Wolf, everyone.  We don't have any tomahawk in there or anything.  Do you play that on the street for some change or what? 
[00:19:30]  This is how I make a living on the street.  Right on, man.  I worked one year with Native Spirit.  Right.  On the subway.  Right.  And we're going to it full time and I'll go and come too.  Oh, cool.  Do you know any Christmas songs on that thing?  Yeah, I could do maybe a year of service.  All right.  We're trying to get to know our new friends, Anthony, before they board the bus for the mall in Jersey.  All right.  All right. 
[00:20:00]  I think that one needs a little work, but not bad.  A little bit.  It's a little shy.  And who's this?  Thomas?  Hey, get closer to the mic.  Yeah.  Thanks, me.  What's your deal, Thomas?  Well, I just catch work wherever I can, anytime I can.  And, well, I also do recycling things. 
[00:20:30]  You know, redeemables, you know, stuff.  I ran up to the redemption center up on 11th Avenue, West 56nd Street.  We also had a nice shift up there as well, running from 5 to 11.  I'm sorry, 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.  So you collect the cans and get over there with your stuff?  What do you mean by the...  Well, I do that...  Well, that's one thing I do.  Okay.  Anything I catch is also work off the books.  I don't have the world's easiest time at that when I do catch something. 
[00:21:00]  What do you usually catch?  I'm sorry.  As far as work goes, what do you usually catch?  Well, it had been at the flea market up on 6th Avenue.  Part of them, the David Kell interview the other day.  About 26th Street recently.  Right.  I was there.  Okay.  Now, how long have you been homeless?  Well, let's say too long.  Like how long?  Seriously.  Longer than you can remember? 
[00:21:30]  Let's say about the better part of...  Shoot.  The better part of 70 years or so.  Wow.  Yeah.  Where did it go wrong for you?  You know?  A lack of work.  A lack of work?  Any boozing or anything like that?  In your past?  More like myself.  A steam fell off a lot.  I just gave up.  Just didn't care too tough.  So thanks to help a few good people here and I.  I'm trying to get myself back on track again.  Right on.  Well, we have a fun day for you planned here. 
[00:22:00]  A little field trip.  We're going to give you $102 to spend any way you want in the mall.  We're feeding you guys and giving you like a prize package.  Mm-hmm.  You're going to stay awake?  You look a little tired.  You all right?  Let's put it like this.  For me, it's an adventure living out of a locker.  I understand that.  And if I have my way about it,  some of that money would go up on January's rent where I got to pay my storage.  All right.  And Manhattan mini storage, hey, they're good.  Right.  They're real good.  I'm grateful for it.  All right. 
[00:22:30]  Cool.  Thomas and then Graywolf, right?  Yeah.  All right.  We've got to take a quick break, Anthony.  All right.  The bus is leaving in about 20 minutes to that fine mall in Jersey  so these guys can spend $102 any way they like for this holiday season.  Absolutely.  We're going to talk to a few more of the guys in just a bit.  Stay right there.  All right.  This is FM Talk at 1027 Talk.  You can't ignore it.  Sophie and Anthony.  The homeless shopping spree about ready to take off, Anthony.  I'm just glad we got a guy named Graywolf. 
[00:23:00]  Graywolf.  Yeah.  Graywolf.  They'll be playing the flute on the bus.  Yeah.  Joey is like stupefied over there.  A little background music.  All right.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Okay.  All right.  Hold on.  John, what's up?  Oh, God.  This is like a big cop out.  What do you mean?  Jersey City is like the armpit of the East Coast.  Jersey?  Isn't that a nice mall?  There's a bunch of nice malls in Jersey. 
[00:23:30]  Trust me.  Yeah, I know.  But you're going to Jersey City, aren't you?  Who told you that?  Everyone thinks they know what mall we're going to.  Everyone thinks they know.  Everyone thinks.  Jersey City because these guys fit right in in Jersey City.  We made sure we found a very nice mall.  See, we need the contrast.  I hope it's one of those weighty-toity joints.  This is how this bit works.  I've been to a bunch of malls where these guys would fit in perfectly.  All right.  We need the contrast, and we will have the contrast.  And we're going to announce the mall in about an hour or so.  Yeah, because I know you guys too well to think that you would bring them to Jersey City. 
[00:24:00]  No, no, no.  You're going to do it.  You do stuff right.  You'll see.  You'll be proud of us.  Okay.  Thank you, John.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Got to say hi to Keith the cop.  Keith helps us a lot on the radio show, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  And Keith is one of the guys that has been rounding up some of the homeless people, right, for us?  Yeah, we found a few guys that were looking to...  What is he looking for on the floor, that guy?  He dropped a couple of tables.  Okay.  A couple of the people that could use $102 out on the street. 
[00:24:30]  He's not taking a leak, is he?  What is he doing?  Ben, did you, uh...  Are you to, uh, thank for this?  Are you to thank for this?  I'm partially responsible.  Where, uh...  Okay.  Where did you find this, uh...  Read through old copy.  From downtown.  From downtown.  From downtown.  Yeah.  What is that guy doing?  What's his name? 
[00:25:00]  Get him on my mic.  He's reading the rock faxes and all the, like, industry insider things.  I don't know what I'm out.  Hey, what's your name, bro?  Uh, Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Hey, Ziggy, what's happening?  I love your comic stretch.  That's funny.  Hey, Ziggy, you've ever been to, uh, Paisano?  That's when I was a kid.  I used to read comic books.  Oh, yeah.  That's when I got caught in the hallway.  What did he do with?  I got caught in the hallway carrying a bottle of Gevall up to Exception.  Whoa. 
[00:25:30]  It broke, uh, it broke, uh, on Exception.  I got two cuts on it.  Right.  And all the blood came out of my mother and put my hand underneath the faucet.  Yeah.  You could still see them.  Really?  Sure.  Then, uh, then after that, I went through a glass window.  Yeah.  And got two glasses, uh, things stuck in my hand.  It's, it's, it's impossible how it didn't go through the rest of the body.  Uh-huh. 
[00:26:00]  The way, uh, the police, uh, got me to the hospital and they, they were trying to take this thing out, but they couldn't take it out.  Ziggy, watch out.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Step aside.  Ziggy.  Ziggy's in the hand.  Ziggy, watch out.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Oh, that hurt.  Ow.  Oh, that must, that must have hurt.  Oh, watch the debris. 
[00:26:30]  This guy from, uh, from, uh, to take a train.  You know this guy falling on a thing with a fighting, fighting with a gun.  Okay.  And I got another guy on the floor.  All right, Ziggy.  But he wanted to fight, so I didn't, I, but, but I wanted, but I wanted to go.  Right.  He wanted to fight, but I wanted to go.  I was fighting over a girl.  He wanted to fight, and I wanted to go.  Right.  I'll tell you, Ziggy makes cocaine, uh, but it's really normal at this point.  And then I pulled down with a big bottle of Coca-Cola. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Right.  And I, and I scratched my fingers.  So I went to the hospital, and the guy took his paper clip.  To get the, to get the bottle.  Yeah.  Just give Ziggy two bucks.  He won't know the difference.  All right, Ziggy.  We can save a hundred for dinner later on.  Ziggy, where do you live?  In the beginning, I broke my leg.  I don't want to.  Well, I thought maybe a direct question might help.  No, there's, there's no, uh. 
[00:27:30]  Ziggy, where do you live?  Any place.  Any place?  Any place.  Is that a place you're in?  Are you looking forward to spending a hundred and two bucks today?  Looking forward to spending?  Yeah.  What are you going to spend your money on today?  He told me, he told me to come here.  Right.  Yeah.  Because this is, what is it?  It's Christmas.  Yeah.  It's Christmas here.  And you get, you get a hundred dollars for the.  A hundred, a hundred and two bucks to spend.  It's not nice.  I'll never forget to write you a letter when I, when I get a stamp.  We're going to, uh, we're going to Jersey, going to a nice mall. 
[00:28:00]  And, uh, you'll be able to buy some Christmas presents and stuff.  Or, uh, some, uh, warm clothes.  Whatever you need.  It's all right.  I got an announcement to, uh, I got an announcement to all our homeless friends.  Uh, we're not arresting anyone today.  A lot of people are very paranoid that they came here to get arrested.  That's not the truth.  No.  We are definitely taking care of you guys today.  Going to a mall.  Going to a mall.  Take a little bus ride.  Have some fun.  Well, Keith, what is this guy's deal?  You, you found him.  Keith the cop.  I have a little rock and roll, sorry. 
[00:28:30]  I think, I think you see a, uh, radio station in Jersey.  I think this guy used to work here at any company.  Yeah, it worked at work.  Hey, it's Scottsdale.  But it wasn't as big.  Yeah.  All right.  It's just a plain station with a, uh.  Right.  All right.  There's no equipment in it.  Okay.  Just, uh, all right.  Well, thank you, Ziggy.  The counter is on.  Keith.  Yeah.  What is, uh, Ziggy's deal?  Ziggy's just a guy, uh, a local guy from downtown that caught on his luck, so we figured we'd 
[00:29:00]  bring him up.  Do the locals take care of him down there, hopefully?  Uh, yeah.  He gets a lot of beer.  A lot of beer.  You like, uh, you like drinking the beers there, Ziggy?  Yeah.  At least I stay out of everybody's way.  That's all, you know.  Would you be a stay out of everyone's way?  What the hell, huh?  Budweiser's the king of beers.  That's what I would say.  Budweiser's the king of beer.  Yeah.  He's got something in common.  There you go.  I'm sure our sponsors will love that, uh, that endorsement.  Maybe you could be the voice of Budweiser or something.  You know?  Would you like, uh, a beer, Ziggy? 
[00:29:30]  Uh, not a matter of here.  I didn't want to move in this place.  Yeah, that's true, you know.  He probably read the memo that no alcohol is allowed in the, uh, uh, studio.  All right, well, let's hear it for Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Okay.  Merry Christmas.  Uh, enjoy your little trip.  Probably don't get out of, uh, Manhattan much, I guess, huh?  This is like a star.  Is this recording?  No, this is live.  So, is there anyone you want to say hi to Ziggy?  Wow, this is amazing.  A lot of people I heard. 
[00:30:00]  A couple of people.  Just a couple.  You're going to find, uh, that you have a lot of fans when, when you reach that mall today.  And, and we're encouraging our faithful listeners to take care of some of our new friends.  All right?  So, when you make, uh, new friends on the street, just tell them, uh, you can come up to the radio station anytime.  It's Wilton Darvis at K-Rock.  Send them all up there.  If you're looking for free food, go to the Paisanos of Mova's Inn.  It's no wonder Joey didn't bring anything. 
[00:30:30]  He is done, Joey.  All it would have taken was a, uh, a plate of food, Joey.  You're done.  Oh, man.  I'm totally sticking with Joey on this one.  Hey, Joey.  How you doing?  How you doing?  There you go.  How you doing?  All right.  Very good.  Is there anyone else we want to talk to before the bus takes off, uh, Rick?  I think we're ready to rock.  You're ready to rock?  All right.  Okay.  All right.  I'm going to take the manuscript.  Yeah, you can take the manuscript if you like it.  Oh, sure.  I can take one piece of paper. 
[00:31:00]  That's all right.  We got plenty of paper.  It's good.  Yeah, you can have all the, you can have all the paper you want.  You can take as much paper as you want.  Let's see what it says.  There you go.  Hey, Ziggy.  Ziggy.  I got with you, Ziggy.  Steve Ziggy knows a, a, a, a, a quick Christmas, a, a quick Christmas song as we go to break.  Sure.  Ziggy, do you know any Christmas songs?  Yeah, I know a Christmas song.  I love all of them.  You want to, you want to sing one real fast for us?  I think I can sing it.  All right.  Yeah.  Let's go.  Silent night.  All right. 
[00:31:30]  Holy night.  Always calm.  Always bright.  I didn't have them pegged as an alto.  Round yon virgin mother and child.  Holy infant, so tender and mild.  Sleep in heavenly peace.  Sleep in heavenly peace.  All right. 
[00:32:00]  I think we just found a new star in the next homeless commercial.  Yeah.  You know how they show that?  Yeah, you could sing that song and put it on TV.  There you go.  Let's hear it for Ziggy, huh?  Rick, what do you got?  Yeah, next week, Ziggy's IPO hits the market at Ziggy.com.  There you go.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break.  We're rounding everybody up outside.  We're going to take them downstairs to the bus.  All right.  Rick's got the cell phone.  We'll check in with you outside as everyone loads the bus.  And we'll talk to a few more guys, okay? 
[00:32:30]  What happened?  What happened after my eyes are tearing?  Oh, really?  Okay.  All right.  Fellas, let's rock.  All right.  Come on, Zig.  All right.  Have fun, Ziggy.  You can take that paper with you.  I'd like to just take it, man.  Yeah, you can take it with you, man.  You can have that.  Ziggy rocks, man.  Yeah, thanks.  That's not nice.  Well, at least no one saw it. 
[00:33:00]  Psycho Mark is spraying down the area Ziggy just took over.  A little Lysol.  A little Lysol.  There is a little bit of a wasp coming off of Ziggy.  Okay.  You might want to bring that up on the bus with you.  All right.  Why don't you guys go down to Boston?  We'll check in with you.  Down there.  You know, the funniest thing is, I turn to my right, I see Joey from Paisano sitting here.  It's like there have been days I've seen a smile pasted across his face, and we've had  naked girls dancing a lesbian day and stuff.  Today, he's just sitting here, pissed. 
[00:33:30]  He just looks pissed.  He's like, where do you put Ziggy right next to me?  Ziggy was like three feet from Joey from Paisano.  Ziggy's going to get the best table in the house, I bet.  All right, Larry, what's going on?  That's the same smell you know when your sauce is going bad, right?  That's the another throw it out.  Holy cow.  Hey, Larry, you're next on FM Talks.  Am I?  Yeah, what's up?  Okay.  I want to know if you guys are taking them into Paramus today.  I mean, if you're taking the Riverside Square Mall, which is like high class, beyond all 
[00:34:00]  beliefs, or Garden State, which is like the opening mall in North Jersey.  Yeah.  All you've got to do is ditch these homeless people in Hackensack.  No one will be worse for the wear.  You won't even notice that they're around.  We're going to announce the mall we're going to 20 minutes before we get there, okay?  Oh, man, because I want to get there with my camera.  I've got to get pictures of you guys going to Paramus.  Right on.  Well, we'll just, you know, hang tight to the radio.  You'll find out soon enough.  I'm holding on.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Thanks, man.  Who are these guys, Rick?  They don't look homer.  These are the Opie and Anthony security details. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, right on.  All right.  What do we got?  Chuck.  Hey, Chuck.  What's up?  Yeah.  Romano.  T.J. Hooker.  T.J. Hooker.  T.J. Hooker.  T.J.  Are you guys excited to help us out today?  We got a hell of a crew out there, huh?  Yeah.  Some interesting teams.  Yeah.  You met Ziggy?  Ziggy.  You see him out there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got some kind of Indian.  She's running water.  All right.  Hey, they don't want to shop, though. 
[00:35:00]  They want to pocket the money.  Oh, no.  They're shopping.  They have to shop.  That's what we told you.  Got to shop, dude.  Got to shop.  I think what's going to happen, they'll shop, and then if some of our faithful listeners  show up at the mall, maybe they can help us out and give the homeless people some money  they can take with them.  It would be a very nice gesture today.  Just so we're going to let you know that in case anybody tries to boot our shoppers,  we've got the harassment and trespassing statutes with us.  Awesome.  All right.  That's a great thing on a mess.  We've got them with us.  We have cops, Anthony. 
[00:35:30]  We've got a lawyer on the bus.  Yeah.  This is going to happen.  I've got to hook up with the lawyer, though.  He's out there.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  We'll talk to you guys on the bus.  Nice meeting you.  Yeah, Godspeed, man.  We're going to have to have a beer together after this, all right?  Hell yeah.  All right.  All right.  Security detail.  Wow.  Let me tell you something.  The studio reeks, man.  Are you smelling that?  Yeah, it's really bad.  It was okay until Zigmeister came.  Oh.  I bet Ziggy hasn't seen a shower in, God, it's probably been a long time. 
[00:36:00]  It's weird to get a whiff of him at this mall.  This mall is going to be horrified, man.  I swear to God.  Let's look at Ron on line 11.  Line 11.  Hold on a second.  Hey, Ron, you're next on FM Talk.  What's up?  Hey, O&A.  What's up?  All right.  Come on.  That wasn't a homeless guy named Ziggy.  That was Jim Brewer doing another voice.  No, I swear to God.  It was like Brewer, wasn't it?  It was, man.  Man, we got some fine pictures of Ziggy. 
[00:36:30]  We're going to put it on the unofficial website.  You're not going to believe it.  All right, cool.  That's when I thought our homeless people were too normal looking.  Ziggy walked in and the Indian guy walked in.  We're set and ready to go now, man.  I don't know who was scarier, man.  The Indian dude or Ziggy.  I don't know, man.  Ziggy.  Ziggy?  Ziggy picked up a pile of papers that he thought it was a manuscript for some kind of movie.  Yeah.  And he wanted to read through it.  It was like old, like, copy from old commercials and rock facts and stuff. 
[00:37:00]  And he took it with him.  So.  All right, Ron.  Okay.  Keep reading this.  All right, thank you.  All right, bye.  Totally good insulation.  Totally good.  All right.  Things are really, uh...  I think there was a Paisano reading, man.  All right.  Things are starting to cook now, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Next time we talk, hopefully we'll be on the street with Rick outside the bus that the homeless  people will be boarding.  If you smell what Ziggy's cooking.  I can't even believe these morons.  He's a disgusting little man, Anthony. 
[00:37:30]  What a douchebag.  I mean, Rick.  Stand over.  This is sicker than faces of death.  Ignore Topia and Anthony.  Hey, man.  They are spraying down the studio as we speak.  Oh, my God.  My eyes are tearing.  Yeah, it's a little, uh...  Mmm.  A little thick.  Out there. 
[00:38:00]  All right, let's go to the phone.  Kenny, what's going on?  Hey, O'Day.  Hey.  Hey, you know, just a comment about having Ziggy in there just a minute ago.  Yeah.  You know, it's kind of special.  Like, you know, it's almost Christmas, and here's a guy, he doesn't know where he's going  to sleep tonight, let alone Christmas Eve, and he's got nothing.  No child to go home to see a smile when he gives them a present or something.  Yet he can belt out, you know, a Christmas carol like that and be as happy as the next  guy, you know? 
[00:38:30]  Well, you sound like you're getting a little choked up.  No, it's just kind of weird.  This is my first Christmas with a new child, Mom.  Well, I just, you know, I think of it like, what would I think, you know?  Hey, I mean, we are definitely having fun today, and we're going to, you know, we're  going to stick it to some snooty people, but the fact is, we're definitely helping  a bunch of people this holiday season.  You got to see that part of this, man.  Ziggy's singing Silent Night.  That'll be with me forever.  Yeah, that was something, huh? 
[00:39:00]  All right, that's it.  Just an observation.  All right, thank you.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  Donna, what's going on?  Hi, how you doing?  Real good.  I just want to tell you that lady that called earlier that you hit with the train.  Yeah.  I have to agree with her, but in the same sense, you're doing something really great for  these people.  Something that, like, nobody else is going to do for them.  Let me tell you something.  They're laughing and having a great old time, you know, outside the studio, eating and getting  ready for this big day.  Well, I'm here cooking for a party, a Christmas party, and I'm thinking about these people, 
[00:39:30]  and I'll tell you, no matter what anybody says, wherever you go, you can come to my living  room and have dinner.  I don't care.  All right.  I mean, these people need you, and you're doing good, and God bless you all.  Have a great holiday, God bless you, God bless you, everyone.  Don, I think you would want Ziggy to shower about ten times, though, before dinner.  Probably.  Oh, yeah.  Probably.  I'll let him use the bed.  I'll just...  I'm not going to lie to you.  I've never smelled anything so unbelievable in my life.  Yeah.  Well, you know, some are unfortunate, and some, you know, we have showers. 
[00:40:00]  They don't.  All right.  Good.  Okay.  Have a great one.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  You guys have no, any kind of medical support, do you?  Could you use a volunteer ambulance person, a medic?  I think at this point, Ant and I need shots.  A little spray to Lysol.  I'm not kidding, man.  Yeah, huh?  We went through two cans of Lysol.  Try Febreze.  All right. 
[00:40:30]  Okay, but you don't need no help, then, huh?  No.  No.  Thank you, Brian.  Okay, bye.  Bye.  We'll go to...  Rick's on the line.  We'll go to him in a second, but first, Wally.  Wally, what's up?  Yeah, all right.  What's going on, guys?  All right.  Listen, I just wanted to warn you.  I'm over at the Bridgewater Commons, and I want to tell you, I don't know if you guys  are coming here or not, but the cops are everywhere.  Well, we have our own cops.  We have a lawyer on the bus.  You know, this is going to happen, Brian.  I'm just letting you know, man.  They've got Stadies, and they also have the Bridgewater Police and the Somerville Police, 
[00:41:00]  and they're just combing every entrance.  I don't know what's going to happen, but I figured I'd let you guys know.  You know what I mean?  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Have a great day.  Everyone thinks they know what mall we're going to.  Only five people know at this point.  I didn't know where we're going.  No, I know.  I just wanted to give you a heads up and let you know what's going to happen.  We're going to announce the mall soon, though.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  We've got cops at just about all the nice malls in Jersey.  We have two news crews at the malls they assume we're going to, and they don't know where  we're going.  No one knows at this point. 
[00:41:30]  Rick!  Guys!  All right, Rick's downstairs with the homeless people.  How are you doing, Rick?  We're doing good.  We're on 57th, just in front of the Hard Rock.  Okay.  For any of the listeners that are going to be caravanning with us.  We're just getting set.  We almost had one guy already get hit by a freaking taxi, for Christ's sake.  That wasn't Ziggy, was it?  Hold each other's hands.  We've got to do like the school trip thing, where everybody's got to have a buddy.  All right?  As soon as we get rolling, when I tell you exactly what, you know, when we get to the 
[00:42:00]  certain area, I'll give you a call back.  You know what I'm talking about.  I've got fucking code for now, as you know.  Okay.  But you guys are loading the bus as we speak.  Yeah, we're loading the bus now.  God damn, this place is...  I must be downwind from these guys.  Holy crap.  Take extra care of Ziggy for us, okay?  Yeah, definitely.  All right.  And he almost ran off.  We had to make sure we showed him the money again.  He almost ran off.  All right.  And Rick, next time we talk to you, have everyone sing the Christmas carol on the bus, all right? 
[00:42:30]  You got it, dude.  All right.  There goes Rick, everyone.  He's outside the building as they board the bus for Jersey.  And there they go.  Look at that on their little Christmas field trip.  Special day.  Joe, what's up?  You're next on FM Talk.  Oh, what's up?  Yeah.  Listen, why don't you give us a hint?  Like, play a game, like Simon Says, or what highway they're taking, or something.  Well, uh...  What's up with a direction?  Hint?  Honestly, we have a couple decoys out there.  Really?  Yeah, because we want this to happen. 
[00:43:00]  We want them to get to the mall.  Okay.  The next obstacle is, will we get the bus, you know, to the mall?  Because a bunch of cops called and said they're going to, you know, stop the bus and find a reason to, like, impound the bus.  So now, I guess the next thing we've got to hope for, everyone has to keep their fingers crossed, we've got to hope that the homeless bus makes it to this fine mall in Jersey.  All right.  All right, we have to go in stages.  All right.  When it gets to the point of no return, that's when we'll tell everyone what mall it is.  All right, because they've got, like, a 45-minute ride to certain places. 
[00:43:30]  I understand.  All right, thanks, bro.  All right, if you run into the homeless people, though, please take care of them.  They're going to need some extra money after this is over, okay?  You got it.  All right, man, give them some change or anything.  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  How's the S&P back yet?  People loving it.  Cool.  All of them wondering where the hell they're going.  Frank, you're next on FM Talk.  What's up, guys?  All right.  Great show, man.  Thanks.  What's it called?  I think this is a great thing you're doing.  You know, what's it called?  I think it's pretty hysterical, and people that get mad about it, they have no sense of humor. 
[00:44:00]  I'll tell you one thing.  They're having a lot of fun.  I was kind of bummed because we saw the first few homeless guys, and they looked better dressed  than Ant and I.  Yeah.  And, well, that's not the case anymore.  I think it's great.  They're having fun.  It's funny for us.  The people that Ben and Keith the Cop got from Washington Square Park are priceless.  Wow.  Absolutely priceless.  All right, Frank.  All right, guys.  Take care.  You guys talk.  Thank you.  I can't wait until this really exclusive mall gets the likes of Gray Wolf. 
[00:44:30]  Gray Wolf and Ziggy.  And Ziggy.  Gray Wolf with his little flute.  Got to play a little tune for the mall patrons.  Why not?  I think Ziggy ought to go and try on some clothes.  I want Ziggy in one of the exclusive clothing stores trying on some pants.  You know, he wants a job, so maybe he needs a nice business.  Yeah, maybe they should try on a nice business suit.  Mike. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, two things, guys.  Yeah.  If you don't go to the Short Hills Mall, you're dropping the ball because that's the snobbiest  freaking mall in the Tri-State area.  All right.  All right.  Two.  I love everybody calling and congratulating you guys.  Let me tell you something.  I'm a big fan, but you guys aren't doing this for any other reason, but it's great radio.  Give me a freaking break.  We're helping these guys out.  We're giving them something that they haven't had in years.  Hey, Mike.  Mike, keep it to yourself.  I definitely will.  Guys, good luck today.  I'm waiting to hear which mall you're going to.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  I think Ziggy needs to go into Saks Fifth Avenue. 
[00:45:30]  And then maybe play with some toys at FAO Schwartz or something.  Oh, why not?  All right.  Well, the phones are just going nuts.  Wow.  I think we need to play a couple tunes.  All right.  Yeah, we can do that.  Spaz is running in like crazy.  I mean, the media is calling.  Oh.  Everyone is trying to figure out where we're going.  We'll play a couple songs before we break.  What the hell? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  We'll start with some Zeppelin.  It's going to be a special day on the Opie and Anthony show today.  Oh, yeah.  More to come in just a bit.  We'll check in with Rick again very soon.  All right?  It's 1027.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's FM Talk 1027.  And we got Rick back on the phone.  We're doing our homeless shopping spree today.  Everyone is coming into the studio shaking their heads.  What's wrong, Char?  We lost a homeless person already? 
[00:46:30]  Wait, get our mic.  We lost one?  Well, we didn't lose one.  He just decided he didn't want to do it.  He thought we were ripping him off.  He didn't want the money.  He wanted the money just to leave.  He didn't want to stop.  It wasn't Gray Wolf or Ziggy, was it?  No, Ziggy.  Oh, okay, good.  Ziggy's still good.  Ah, okay.  Thank God.  But they're on the bus jetting like any minute right now.  All right, cool.  Thank you.  What's up, Earl?  Rudy and I, we were setting up the bus.  Yeah.  Yeah, and all the truckers were like beeping their horns, saying Opie and Anthony, and  one guy screaming at the top of his lungs, feed the homeless, feed the homeless. 
[00:47:00]  Well, they are getting fed.  Did you see Gray Wolf couldn't even wait?  He had a sandwich, and he's on the air over here.  He's stuck unwrapping it and eating it.  He thought it was on the air.  He thought it was bison.  Mmm.  Keep them good grub.  Me get into trouble years ago with fire water.  White men's fire water.  Uh, Rick, what's up?  Guys, what's happening?  All right, Rick's on the homeless bus right now as we speak. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, I heard you guys were a little concerned that we may have lost Ziggy or Gray Wolf.  No, those guys are still here.  All right, good.  Uh, Ziggy's actually, like, setting up camp in the back seat.  The only way I rousted him from his map is when I asked him if he wanted a ginger ale.  He came running down my arm.  Ah, yeah.  But he's in good shape, and he's in good spirit.  All right, everyone's in a good mood right now, Rick?  Yeah, it looks like, hey, you guys in a good mood?  Ready to spend some cash?  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:48:00]  All right.  All right, we're about to be pulling away from 57th Street, heading to a certain bridge  of unnamed, uh...  Oh, yeah, gee, can't figure that one out.  Shut up, man.  But, uh, yeah, we're about to pull out any second here, and we'll call you guys back in  about 15, 20 minutes.  All right, get Psycho Mark to organize these guys to sing one of the Christmas carols that  we have for them, okay? 
[00:48:30]  All right, now?  Uh, in a little while.  In a little while, we'll do a Christmas carol.  I think Texas Halls would be good.  That's an easy one.  Okay.  There's not many words in that one.  Yeah, that's true.  All right, we'll talk to you in a few minutes, Rick.  All right, dude.  Thank you.  Peace.  God, Giuliani should just be indebted to us right now.  We're helping the homeless problem.  We're shipping them to Jersey right now.  We're doing our part this holiday season, Anthony.  Because of Opie and Anthony, there will be less homeless in New York.  You ought to adopt our plan.  Uh, Brendan. 
[00:49:00]  What's going on, guys?  All right.  Hey, I gotta warn you guys.  Yeah.  There are cops.  I live around the corner from the Bridgewater Mall.  Yeah.  I've been driving around all day.  There are cops all over Jersey.  Well, yeah.  They're Jersey cops.  No, yeah.  Oh, come on.  Besides that, Delvin, but they're out for it today.  All right.  Yeah, there's nothing they can do.  No one knows what mall we're going to yet.  Oh, I know that, but I'm just saying watch it, because they're looking for you.  All right.  Thank you. 
[00:49:30]  You got it.  All right.  Bye.  Later, guys.  Instant feedback.  We got Rocco and Clifton.  Bring them all into KB Toys.  It would be hysterical to watch the kids scatter.  That would be pretty funny.  Patrick, what's going on?  Hey, nothing much.  All right.  I just want to congratulate you guys on what you're doing.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  It's about time someone figures out what we're doing here.  Yeah, and people are calling and whining about it and saying that you're doing it for radio,  but you guys deserve the credit. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, thanks.  You're the ones who are doing it, so you should take credit for it.  Okay.  We are doing this for no other reason than to help the homeless on this holiday season.  And if anyone gets credit for it, you guys deserve it.  Come on.  Hopi and Anthony, Advocates for the Homeless.  All right.  All right.  Cool.  All right.  Thank you, Patrick.  All right.  My God.  I don't see anyone else doing anything.  Joy. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  What's going on?  How are you guys?  All right.  I work at Nordstrom at the Grand State Plaza.  Okay.  And do you have any homeless women coming?  To be honest with you, I think it's all guys because we didn't want any rape charges today.  Okay, well, it doesn't matter.  Yeah, God knows what we're going on in the back of that bus.  I think he might want to taste.  I believe there's no women.  Well, if you go to Nordstrom, it doesn't matter.  We really can't confirm that because they are wearing so many clothes that it's really tough to sell. 
[00:51:00]  Just make sure they go to the perfume counters.  And they have to get all free samples.  Okay.  They have to go.  They're going to have to fumigate them at the perfume counter.  Use a super soaker full of Old Spice.  And I also wanted to ask, why are you all afraid of the cops?  Because there's nothing illegal about them.  No, there isn't.  We're not afraid of the cops.  We have our own cops and we have a lawyer on the bus.  So why are all these people calling up and giving you a problem?  Well, I don't know.  They seem to think there will be a problem.  I'm working here at the Orange Land and you guys were here.  And Psycho Mark was here last week.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[00:51:30]  I'm waitressing.  And actually, the bartender, Christy, wanted to talk to you about it because she has an  opposite opinion of me.  Well, we've got to move on, though.  Tell her to shove it up her butt.  Wait, hold on.  Christy, come here.  Shove it up her butt.  There you go.  I've been ranting and ranting all day about this.  Hold on one second.  Here she is.  Here she is.  Hello?  Hey, what's your problem?  I think that it's pretty friggin' rude that you're bringing them here and just leaving  them.  Well, they're allowed to stay if they want.  It's a free country.  Well, why are you bringing them here instead of taking them shopping in New York? 
[00:52:00]  I'd be proud to have Ziggy in my neighborhood.  You wouldn't?  I'm not proud to have him here.  Well, too bad.  I don't like them that they're going to be here and just stay here and just, you know.  Have an open mind, you twat.  Hey!  I want to go see them.  I'll go to New York again.  That's where they are.  That's where they live.  That's where I live here.  All right.  An all-little handful is now coming to Jersey.  Fries are up.  Get back to work.  I don't wait. 
[00:52:30]  All right.  Bye.  Goodbye.  Putting a damper on our little party today, Ed.  Please.  It's like a little handful of homeless being shipped over to Jersey today.  All right, George.  What's going on?  Yeah.  I just want to say, like, you always have these Hollywood types that claim to advocate  certain cause, rip-in, and they think they're doing something.  Here we have Opie and Anthony.  Yes.  They do what nobody else could do. 
[00:53:00]  They're actually doing something.  I know it's in a small way, but you're helping out a bunch of guys.  All right.  Thank you, George.  And you should be praised and lauded.  And the whole city of New York should thank you.  We should all rent our own buses.  All right.  We should all follow your leads.  And then we would solve a problem.  Yeah.  We wouldn't be wearing ribbons or anything.  You know?  All right.  You guys are doing a good thing.  More power to you.  Thank you.  See that? 
[00:53:30]  Look at the adulation we're getting.  Doesn't it feel good?  I got to tell you, one of the homeless guys, he's really happy because we saved him bus  fare because he wanted to go to Jersey.  Oh, really?  He's definitely going to stay today.  Look at that.  See?  So not only is he getting $102 to spend today at one of those fine malls, he's actually  saving bus fare as well.  Getting a bus fare to Jersey.  His new home.  The place he will now call home.  Hyman.  What's Hyman?  Hyman.  What's up?  Do you know Gray Wolf?  Yeah, I know Gray Wolf. 
[00:54:00]  Is Ziggy a little guy who looks like his face was used like a punching bag for a long time?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Don't make fun of our Zig.  No, I love the guy.  Actually, both of those guys sang in key.  Well, the most beautiful thing about Ziggy is the cops know him and they ask him to get  up off the street.  He lives in front of this place called Stromboli.  It's a pizza joint on Avenue, First Avenue. 
[00:54:30]  Okay.  On the ground.  He lives on top of a garbage bag.  Well, now he's got a blanket, courtesy of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  A wool blanket.  I'm serious.  That's great.  All right?  That's great.  All right.  Cool.  Beautiful thing.  Thank you.  Beautiful things for people.  All right.  Thank you, Tim.  Is that any of you in that book of Jersey?  Yeah.  Oh.  Thank you for coming in every Friday and Saturday and polluting my neighborhood.  All right.  Cool.  Good night.  Good night.  All right, Anthony.  Danny, what's going on? 
[00:55:00]  All right.  Good.  Hey.  Johnson.  I'm going to open, Anthony?  Yeah.  You're on the air, Danny.  Good stuff.  We're coming down the park.  How's it going?  Well, they'll know soon enough, man.  Yeah.  How much longer?  I got to check.  All right.  Cool.  Good day.  All right.  Thank you, Danny.  Bye.  Bye.  And we'll do that.  We'll check in with Rick on the homeless bus next.  This is FM Talk at 1027 Talk.  You can't ignore it.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:55:30]  Today is the big day.  We're doing the homeless shopping spree, Anthony.  Yes, we are.  Very excited.  As we speak, the homeless bus is on its way to Jersey.  To a very nice mall.  Oh, yeah.  Jersey.  Junior from Jersey on the Instant Feedback.  Just wanted to say that for the first time ever, I am afraid to shut the radio off.  Quick question.  When the S hits the fan, will you guys make a statement to the press?  Because you know this will be all over the news tonight.  Be good guys.  Talk hard. 
[00:56:00]  Junior.  Well, we do have some news crews.  They're at a couple malls in Jersey, assuming they know which mall we're going to, Anthony.  We didn't tell anyone which mall.  Yes.  Because we didn't want anyone tipped off.  So, pretty much, there's a panic all over Jersey as we speak.  I got a little description of the mall, Opie, that they're going to.  Okay.  Very luxurious.  Let me take a look with you.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, our homeless, uh, I don't know if we should even name some of the stores, Ant. 
[00:56:30]  No, I think you can, uh, just say the, uh, maybe their little, uh, motto that they have,  whatever it is, their little slug line.  Yeah.  An oasis of luxury.  An oasis of luxury, minutes from Manhattan.  That's where our own homeless will be shopping.  They actually plug the mall as being an oasis of luxury.  So, you see, we're not, we're not pussying out on this one, people.  Believe me.  They are going to look like the proverbial square pegs in the round halls. 
[00:57:00]  An oasis of luxury, Opie.  And they better not mess with our homeless.  They are people, too.  I'm looking at the list of stores, and it just.  All right, let's talk.  One, two, three, go.  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells.  Oh, my son, it is true.  The wild, one, three, three, three.  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells. 
[00:57:30]  You hear Grey Wolf and Grey Wolf's fluid.  Oh, my son, it is true.  Oh, my son, it is true.  All right, good job, guys.  All right, Rick.  Oh, my, we almost took out a homeless guy in the street, for Christ's sake.  Holy crap.  Yeah, the homeless guy's on the bus looking out and going, oh, he's frigging homeless.  It's getting in the way of our trip.  We got the Chiefs who are still playing. 
[00:58:00]  We hear Grey Wolf, yes.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hello, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Oh, they're breaking out into a rap.  Let's hear a homeless rap.  You're going to do a rap, you see?  You're going to rap, you see?  No, I can't rap, man.  I'm going to try myself.  I'll put something together.  I'll put something together.  I'll put something together.  Damn, it's fun.  I wish I was on the bus, though. 
[00:58:30]  One guy's falling asleep.  Wake him up.  Jose, wake him up, man.  He's going to leave it on us.  Jesus Christ.  Ziggy, how you doing, man?  Okay, I'm bad.  Ziggy's jamming, man.  Ziggy, how you doing?  All right, we're just about ready to cross the TW.  All right.  The unnamed bridge.  Okay, Rick.  You guys figured that one out.  What?  Why don't you talk to a few of the other guys we haven't talked to yet.  All right.  Anyone else want to say hi on the radio there? 
[00:59:00]  What's your name, dude?  What's your name?  Keith.  Keith?  Yeah.  You want to talk to the guys real quick, Keith?  I'm cool.  I'm listening to my music now, man.  He's listening to the music.  This guy's got a rock band.  Oh, he does?  Oh, so he's not even listening to us.  No, he's not even listening to the station.  He's back.  Well, I think he's trying to win money on Hot 93 or something.  All right.  All right.  Let me talk to Ben real fast.  All right.  Ben's in the van, actually.  Oh, Ben's following you guys, huh? 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, he's in the van following you.  What are you laughing at?  What are you laughing at?  I think Ziggy dropped a bomb.  They're all laughing.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, Ziggy, huh?  Did you guys bring Lysol on the bus?  Yeah, one of the guys is spraying right now.  All right.  Very good, man.  Oh, combat pay, dude. 
[01:00:00]  Combat pay.  The L.A. security for the combat pay.  Hey, can people tell what bus you're on?  No, I don't think all the 1027 FM talk stickers we put all across the sides of the bus are going to tip anybody off.  I think we're pretty well camouflaged.  Oh, very nice.  All right, Rick, anything else to report at this time?  I've got to go because we're going to start breaking up as we get ready to cross the bridge here, so we're going to lose the signal.  Great move there. 
[01:00:30]  What a great move.  I don't know if you're familiar with the steel girders on the bridge here.  What an ass.  Thank you, Rick.  All right, guys, I'll check in when we get closer to the mall.  Okay.  We've got to give away the mall very soon because a bunch of listeners want to join you guys.  Yeah, I can't wait to see the Oasis that they have.  All right, thank you.  All right, later.  Bye.  Bye.  Say goodbye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  There they go. 
[01:01:00]  A bus full of homeless on their way to an exclusive mall in Jersey.  All right, thank you, Rick.  All right, later, guys.  Let's check in with Ben, who's following the bus as we speak, Anthony.  All right.  Hey, Ben.  Yeah.  What's going on?  What's happening, guys?  You weren't stupid enough to get on that bus, huh?  No, I'm in the nice, smell-free van.  All right.  Are you in the FM Talk van?  I am in the FM Talk van.  All right, and you're following the bus?  Actually, right now, we're right in front of them.  Any cops following the bus at this time? 
[01:01:30]  I don't see any cops at the moment.  Okay.  I just see a lot of people cheering us on as we drive down the street.  Very good.  Oh, my God.  It's going to be like Patton rolling into a nice European city.  Look at you.  Well, there's a lot of stages to this homeless shopping spree.  The next stage, we've got to worry about.  We've got to make sure we get to the mall without the cops stopping us.  So we're all keeping our fingers crossed.  But, Ben.  Yeah.  You did a great job finding these people, man.  Thank you very much.  I knew that you'd like Ziggy the best.  Ziggy is a classic. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, they're going to love him.  He might be a regular member on the radio show after today.  They're going to love him at that mall, I'll tell you that.  All right, Ben.  We'll check in with you soon, all right?  Okay, guys.  All right, bye.  Later.  Bye.  Jim, you're next on FM Talk.  What's going on?  Yeah, I just wanted to call and say hi.  And I think it's hilarious.  I live in Jersey.  Yeah.  And this is the funniest thing.  You have all these homeless people coming in and pissing off all these white people.  Well, there's some white homeless on our bus.  No, I know that.  But I think it's even funnier that all these rich white people that you're bringing them into their neighborhoods. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  They're throwing a fit.  Oh, cool.  Screw them.  It's hilarious.  You got to see some of the stores they're going to be shopping.  And you're not going to believe it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I mean, the list of names, we won't go into them right now.  But any exclusive store you could think of, they are in this mall.  Oh, man.  I mean, it is amazing.  That's great.  I don't know what 102 bucks is going to get you at this mall, Oak.  I don't know.  I think they're going to be able to buy a pretzel. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, I'm looking at the other stuff this mall offers.  I'm hoping they have a Santa Claus because we want a few of the homeless guys to get a picture with Santa.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to sit on his lap.  Without a doubt.  All right.  Thank you, Jim.  All righty.  Bye.  Oh, we got to check in with Jay Moore, our buddy, our pal.  He's back in town.  Hey, Jay.  Hi, gentlemen.  How are you, buddy?  Last time I checked, I was in that studio, and you guys said, come back any time.  Yeah. 
[01:03:30]  Well, I called Rick, the producer, and he said, today's not a good time.  No, you can come down.  He told me no.  Shut up.  Screw Rick.  Rick told me no.  Well, you know, he still hates you from the last time you were here.  He had to tie my shoes like a little geisha girl.  Well, he was like your little, he was your little bitch.  I only have about 20 minutes on the homeless, you know?  I only have about 20 minutes of homeless material.  Yeah, really?  I could have absolutely just launched scuds for about 20 minutes.  Jay, come down, man. 
[01:04:00]  I'm cleaning my apartment now.  Oh, what a, oh, come on.  Don't blame me.  Blame your producer.  Today's not a good time, he said.  You got to call us personally.  You don't even have to ask him.  Just show up.  Joey Paisano last night with Joey.  I know.  He's in the studio.  He goes, yeah, I'm going up.  I said, you know what?  I'd love to go up because I want to go up there and pitch.  I have nothing to sell.  I want to go up there just because I like those guys.  Yeah.  Hey, Jay, you know what you got to do next time you're in here?  You definitely got to fight Rick because there's too many things going on between you guys.  What's going on?  The guy's got arms like a tree trunk.  Who cares? 
[01:04:30]  You can take him down.  You're a wrestler.  I know I can take him down.  I just don't want to get hit.  Now, Jay, you...  I have a very marketable face.  Let's put it on the table right now.  You don't have to ask anyone.  You just show up whenever you want.  Yeah.  Screw Rick and everyone else.  Just show up.  Your friends who called me at home and said, today's not good.  Oh.  You can come by tomorrow.  I said, tomorrow I'm going back to L.A.  I'm here for a day.  One day I'm here.  I want to do all the things and Rick tells me no.  Wait.  So you're not even coming tomorrow?  I'm going back to L.A. 
[01:05:00]  Get in here right now.  I got a home.  I got a wife.  I got a job.  Just get your ass in here.  Okay.  I don't have a job.  Dude, jump in a cab and come down.  I can.  I got stuff to do, man.  You son of a bitch.  No, no.  Redirect that.  You son of a gun.  Look at Rick and say that.  I can't believe it.  I didn't know.  Dude, if I knew, I would have said, Rick, what are you doing?  I said, today is not good.  We got so much comedy today.  We don't need to have a room.  We have a guy that has a limo that will pick you up right now. 
[01:05:30]  He's on line five.  A guy that drives all our people around.  No, I really can't today.  I was going to.  I made it a whole thing today.  I was going to go up.  I had nothing to promote.  I was going to go up just for the fun.  And then when I found out about the homeless thing, I got like 20 minutes on the homeless.  Yeah.  I hate the homeless.  Hey, Jay, how funny is this, though?  We're going to the sickest mall in Jersey.  It's a great idea.  Which mall?  Short Hills?  We're not saying at this moment in time.  Everyone is guessing.  Short Hills or Paramus Park.  Look at you.  Shut up.  Definitely not Willowbrook, because that's the homeless people anyway. 
[01:06:00]  When are you back in New York?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm so bummed out.  Put Rick on.  Why did he say today was no good?  He's on the bus with the homeless people.  He's not even here right now.  What the hell is he talking about?  Jay, next time you just show, please don't even call.  Yeah, you have like that open invite.  You want to go tomorrow because you're strippers.  I said, I'm flying back to L.A. tomorrow.  Dude, we have, I mean, today's a great show, but tomorrow we got the whole lesbian for a  day thing again.  We got a 73-year-old.  Lesbian what? 
[01:06:30]  We do the, I want to be a lesbian for a day.  We have a, you kind of started with the kissing cousins.  That was pretty amazing.  I think Brewer took a lot of flack that day.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You got a problem, you and Brewer?  No, he got mad at me because I went over my time if the comics come home.  Oh, really?  In Boston, I went like 10 minutes over my time and he was on after me.  Yeah, because it was like anybody that brought up your name, he was just kind of like, ah,  Jay, Jay Moore.  I love Brewer.  There's nothing he could do that could ever turn me against him.  Cool.  Because we like both you guys. 
[01:07:00]  He's so, he's hilarious.  Yeah.  But it really pissed him off that I went over because I think he had a hard time his first  couple of jokes because the crowd was still like going retarded over like, ah, and Brewer,  believe me, anybody who's anybody that's ever seen a Jim Brewer show knows that it's not  to be taken lightly.  That guy comes with the full barrel gun.  Oh, yeah.  Jim Brewer's one of the funniest guys alive.  Hey, when does this comics come home happening?  I think it's Sunday night.  It sounds like a good one.  It's on Comedy Central, right?  Yeah.  Hey, Rick's on the line. 
[01:07:30]  You want to yell at him?  Yeah.  All right.  He's on the bus with the homeless people, so be kind.  He's going to be homeless.  All right.  Hold on.  Hey, Rick.  Yo.  Jay Moore's on the line.  Yeah.  He told me today not to come by.  Hey, Rick, turn your radio down.  All right.  Hold on.  Is Rick the one with the loud radio playing in the background?  Yeah.  Because he should be smacked.  All right.  Try it again.  There we go.  Hey, Rick.  Yo, Jay.  You told me today not to come by.  It wasn't a good day, right?  No.  I said today is not going to be as good a day as tomorrow was.  No, you said today is not good. 
[01:08:00]  That's a quote.  Today is not good, Jay.  I understood your request through Joey that you were looking to see certain types of guests.  So, believe me, tomorrow is a gash fest.  Yeah.  First and foremost, I just wanted to hang with the guys to prove to them that I was down with nothing to promote, with nothing to...  Yeah, we believe you.  Well, I wanted to come up and hang out.  Anytime, man.  Well, you know, Rick said today is not a good day.  Instead of spending another 40 minutes on the phone with us, get your ass down here.  I can.  Now it's me. 
[01:08:30]  I got stuff to do.  Even Joey's getting pissed.  Come on, Jay.  You promised.  Jay, I called you at 11 o'clock this morning.  Joey called me for dinner last night, by the way.  Did he?  Oh, man.  That's not right.  You charged a Hollywood star?  He's got all that money.  I don't know.  Hey, Jay, I called you this morning at 11 o'clock and told you if you wanted to come down, just page me.  But I told you that tomorrow would be a better day.  But that was at the tail end of the message.  The first part of the message was, Jay, it's Rick.  Look, today's not good. 
[01:09:00]  Tomorrow we got, like, bedlam going on, et cetera, et cetera.  But today's, you know, today's not a really good day.  No.  The last one's in the studio.  Opie said come back any time.  That's it.  Yeah.  But Rick took executive powers to open it.  Opie said any time except today, the only day you're available to come in, just to have fun with the guys because you're a fan of the show.  I had no idea that it was your only day.  What do you think?  I live in L.A.  I'm trying to get a movie deal. 
[01:09:30]  I'm trying to get movies here.  I'm trying to get movies here.  I don't know you got homeless stuff.  I'm a comic.  Do you want to bust with those stinky bastards right now?  You don't know anything about homeless people.  Do you want to bust with those stinky bastards right now?  Yeah, I am.  Ask them why they wear 15 winter coats in the summertime.  What is that?  A chest of strength?  I don't know, man.  Some of them are sleeping.  It's like Siddhartha.  They're all like, I must see how much heat I can withstand. 
[01:10:00]  Some of them are sleeping?  Don't they do enough time during the day?  Biggie's crashed out in the back.  Who, Biggie?  I think he's taken root.  What does that smell like right now?  But, Jay, I was also trying to get your bed for you.  Hey, Rick.  You got that all done.  Hey, Rick.  Rick, what smell is winning?  The homeless or your Drakkar Noir cologne?  I can't afford Drakkar.  Oh, yeah, you can't.  It's a Guido cologne of choice. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, but I'm a spick, you rat.  I'm a spick, you rat.  You guys definitely got to fight next time you're together.  I think so.  Fight club.  Fight club?  Yeah.  Jay, you know, if you start losing, trust me, there's a bunch of guys around here that'll  jump in and help you out.  I'll just bring some brothers down with me.  I'll just say, hey, if this Puerto Rican gets on top of me, just, you know.  Hey, that ain't bad, man.  He pulled my man's hair.  Jay, they killed you off in the last episode of your show.  The Brian was at Time of Death, 9.30 Thursday. 
[01:11:00]  Ben.  The stroke of brilliance.  And that bitch, Jennifer Love Hewitt, they sign her up and keep her show going.  Her show got worse ratings than mine.  I know.  What a rack.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Cans one out, man.  I am so happy to not be on TV.  You got to get, really?  You got to get Preston plans.  Why are you happy?  Because I didn't realize how hard I worked until I had time off.  And today I slipped for two.  I slipped for four.  That's what I got.  I got two portos.  I got a couple Buttman videos. 
[01:11:30]  I'm just, like, spraying the infield.  That's all I just sit around.  You know when those guys come out, like, the sixth inning, and they just hose down the infield?  Right, right.  It doesn't blow away.  That's all you're doing.  That's all I do.  Uh-oh.  You didn't dump that, did you?  No, not at all.  I just spray the infield.  Hold on.  Jay, let me get rid of Rick.  Rick, what's the...  Get rid of Rick.  Why don't you fire him?  Hey, Rick.  Rick.  Yeah, what?  What's wrong?  I think we got a caravan of listeners following us right now.  Oh, awesome. 
[01:12:00]  All right, very good.  Hey, all you listeners out there.  We're in the garbage.  If you get a hold of Rick, kick the crap out of them.  Wouldn't you rather be listening to me right now than Rick with a bunch of stinky people  with logs in their underwear?  Everyone, dick, slash your high beams.  Rick.  Rick looks like the Italian guy at the mall.  He looks like he should be working at a merry-go-round.  Kick his ass.  Thanks, Jay.  Love you.  Want to be a Italian?  I guess you're fine all set. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  Bruce.  Talk your horns if you can hear me.  All right.  Hey, Rick, hang on.  Goodbye.  We'll talk to you soon.  Come in.  All right.  I have a $10 reward for anybody that kicks Rick in the nuts, but no death, please.  No death.  No killing.  There will be no killing of Rick.  No.  Jay, you're funny, man.  It's a nice kick in his donkey balls.  You know he's got like a four-foot drop on those things.  It's like a crown royal bag with stones inside.  A crown royal bag.  I can't believe I'm not sitting up there with my homeboy. 
[01:13:00]  I know.  What are you doing?  That jackass.  Jay, if you really liked us, you'd be here, man.  No.  I'm not going to go with you right now, which is what I'm doing.  All right.  I got a doctor's appointment now.  Aw.  I got to go get my happy pills.  Very good.  Get your happy pills.  There you go.  Yeah, Anthony.  Anthony is no stranger to the happy pills.  Hey, come on.  Anthony takes his happy pill eight ounces at a time in those little red bottles of...  That's right.  Anthony gets wine out of a box.  No. 
[01:13:30]  In his refrigerator, get the box of wine.  Yeah, I heard you guys had quite a night at the Paisanos.  That was fun, man.  It was a lot of fun.  We had a lot of stories.  Yeah.  I'm laughing my ass off.  We're talking about your days in Boston.  Yeah.  About how the mayor died.  Yeah.  That was a good one.  And by coincidence, one of my best friends was the mayor's assistant at that time.  In Boston?  Yeah.  Chappie.  Kevin Chapman.  Oh, very good.  Oops.  So, what's going to happen if Rick...  Am I like an accessory to murder if somebody puts a bullet in Rick's head right now? 
[01:14:00]  Probably.  You know how lawyers are these days.  You could be tied to it.  Yeah.  So, what are you guys doing today?  Are you just talking over there and going back to Rick's remote?  Yeah, it's great, actually.  I mean, we got news crews all over the malls.  Everyone's freaking out.  You guys should have your own TV show.  I don't know what the problem is.  We're getting there.  We got to have Jennifer Love Hewitt on it.  Yeah.  We got to get those big jugs.  We need breast implants to make it on TV.  Jennifer Aniston's got big jugs, too.  But now she lost them.  She lost all that weight.  But when I worked with her, she had jugs and a big fat ass that you want to put your face in. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, God.  I hated her.  But I still went to my trailer and waxed off every day.  Goddamn, that's beautiful.  She hated me.  Did she?  She said to Ileana Douglas, they screen tested six guys, and the one guy I hate they hire.  Wow.  What's the problem?  I don't know, but I thought the movie turned out very well.  Yeah, she didn't like it.  She was very hot, but she had the extra, like, 30, 20 pounds on her.  It's all that big fat ass.  She cleaned that starfish. 
[01:15:00]  When's Marco going to call back, my gay friend?  Your butt buddy, yeah.  People in L.A. are downloading that on the Internet.  It's coming up to me.  Let me tell you.  You know what?  As we go to break, I've got to replay it, because, I mean, we've had so many requests for your gay sex phone call, man.  Gay phone sex.  Gay phone sex.  What floor are you guys on?  Oh, you're coming.  Come on, man.  Come on.  What floor is it?  Come on, Jay.  10th floor, man.  What?  10th floor.  10th.  We got happy pills.  I got them now.  Okay. 
[01:15:30]  All right, cool.  I'll be over there in about 20 minutes.  All right, awesome.  We talked about it.  Jay Moore, our pal, coming back today.  You've got to show up, man.  Come on.  All right, now we need to get him some girls.  He likes looking at girls.  Yeah, any chicks that want to come down, any fine-looking women, just come show up for Jay Moore.  Come to the studio.  Big Hollywood star.  We'll let you in.  All right, we've got to play the gay sex phone call that Jay Moore did last time he was in studio with us, okay?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:16:00]  And we'll check in with Rick and the homeless bus in just a few minutes.  Stay right there.  This is FM Talk at 1027 Talk.  You can't ignore it.  It's Opie and Anthony having a lot of fun today.  And just when we thought it couldn't get any better, Jay Moore, our buddy, our pal, our only Hollywood friend, I believe, Anthony.  Ah, yes.  Is on his way down to join the festivities.  Yeah.  We talked him into it.  He should be here in about 15, 20 minutes.  Cool.  Let's check in with Rick.  We're doing the homeless shopping spree today.  I think everyone knows what's going on with that, right, Ant? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, we've got a busload of homeless headed for a very exclusive mall in New Jersey.  It's been $102 that we gave them.  Uh-huh.  And we also gave them a homeless prize package that includes, got to get my list out here, a wool blanket, a wool hat, a pair of socks.  We gave them some hot food, a pair of gloves, and other things.  Yeah.  And these guys are very, very happy and motivated today, and they can't wait to do some shopping.  So let's go back on the bus with Rick to find out what's going on. 
[01:17:00]  Rick.  Yeah, guys.  What's happening?  All right.  Woo!  Woo!  No, no.  We're waving to people outside.  We got a caravan following the band.  Oh, nice.  And this one guy's just like, oh, my God.  It's like, I knew they were coming this way.  Oh, really?  Yeah, we're about 15 minutes away from the unnamed mall.  Okay.  So do you guys want to reveal that this time, give our faithful a chance to get there and welcome us?  Yeah, we should.  Yeah, let's do it.  I think we should, too.  Let's pop it right now.  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it is none other than the Short Hills Mall, of course. 
[01:17:30]  Woo!  Short Hills Mall!  What the hell do you think?  We're going to push you out, go to, like, the second most exclusive mall in Jersey?  No.  And someone on the Instant Feedback thinks this is a scam like War of the Worlds.  Oh, really?  And is that, wait, War of the...  Yeah.  War of the Worlds.  Yeah, War of the Worlds.  Okay.  It's not a scam.  It's really happening.  They're like 15 minutes away from Short Hills Mall to do some shopping with some homeless people.  Right, Rick?  I'm looking at the pictures off of their website. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, my God.  Look at this stuffy lady in front of Tiffany and Company with her little suit and bag.  And there's a lovely couple ready to shop at Crate and Barrel.  Yeah.  But some of the stores, Bloomingdale's, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Tiffany, Gucci,  FAO Schwartz, Brooks Brothers, Armani Exchange.  I think Ziggy needs to try on some Armani suits.  Don't you, Rick? 
[01:18:30]  I think so.  I think he's got to at least try on a two-piece suit.  Oh, classic.  I mean, you're talking top-of-the-line stores here.  He doesn't look like a best guy, so we'll just keep it a two-piece suit.  Oh, sure.  I think he needs an Armani.  Right now, believe it or not, it's nap time.  What do you mean it's nap time?  Yeah, the guys are all kind of sacked out.  Wait, they're asleep?  Yeah.  What the hell would they do so that they're so tired?  Well, we were singing for a little while.  Oh, that constitutes work.  And I think it kind of tired them out because they're all pretty much sleeping, 
[01:19:00]  except for one guy who just kind of cracked his eyes open.  All right.  Ziggy doesn't even know he left New York.  Ziggy doesn't realize he even left New York.  He's not going to know.  He doesn't know we've taken him across state lines.  Oh, classic.  All right.  But, yeah, he's sleeping.  We've got Snoop Doggy Dogg is hanging over the seat.  The Chief is sleeping.  The Chief.  That's Gray Wolf.  Yeah, Gray Wolf.  Gray Wolf.  Everybody's sleeping.  All right.  We've been catching a nap.  We need him to go to Gucci. 
[01:19:30]  We're going to hand out their T-shirts.  Oh, the T-shirts are classic.  Yeah, but you've got to let Ziggy keep all those coats on, man.  Oh, yeah.  We're just going to have them put it all over what they're wearing.  All right.  Yeah, but make sure they keep their coats on and stuff.  Them walking through this mall.  Yeah.  I mean, if they want to put the shirts on, that's cool,  but make sure they also have the coats on and whatever else.  Picture of Ziggy running into, look at this broad.  I know.  Like, Mickey running into him.  Hi, I'm Ziggy.  I can't wait to take the makeup counter at Macy's. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, the makeup counter.  A Ziggy makeover.  All right.  So everyone's asleep?  We can't even talk to any of them?  All right.  Let me see if any of them woke up.  All right.  Let me see.  Oh, Whitney.  Wait, we had to dump out.  What happened?  We dumped out.  What happened?  I stepped on one of the guy's legs.  And what happened?  I tripped.  They were laying across the seats.  I just heard, ow, S. 
[01:20:30]  What's your name, Don?  Don, yeah.  All right, Don, how you doing, man?  I'm doing all right.  How are you doing?  Pretty good.  Talk to the guy here.  Hey, uh.  Hey, Don?  Uh-oh.  The phone just crapped out.  We're losing the phone.  Guys.  Hey.  All right.  We're losing his connection.  We'll get back to Rick in just a second here.  We can go to Cheryl, who's in the limo following the homeless bus.  Cheryl.  Hey, Cheryl.  Did we lose Cheryl?  All right. 
[01:21:00]  Here, we lost Cheryl.  Because what we have is a homeless bus.  Yeah.  Then we have the FM Talk van.  And then we have Cheryl and the gang in the limo.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Taking the nice vehicle.  Yes.  Hmm.  So, uh, there you have it.  We are going to Short Hills Mall.  We'll be there in about ten minutes, Anthony.  We get him Gucci-skulled.  Eddie, what's going on?  Not much.  All right.  Listen, man.  I got a friend that works in Nevada. 
[01:21:30]  It's like a cream store, like massage creams and all this crazy stuff.  And, uh, I want you guys to go in there.  You think they'll give one of the homeless guys a free massage?  That's what I'm saying.  All right.  Cool.  Have one of the homeless guys in for a massage.  All right.  You got to go in Nordstrom.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Great.  Thank you, Eddie.  Rick's back on the line.  Let's see if he has a better connection.  Rick?  Yeah.  All right.  What's up?  What's happening, guys?  I'm here with Don.  Okay. 
[01:22:00]  Don's one of our, uh, our less fortunate guys who's going to be shopping today.  Don, you want to talk to the guys real quick?  Hey, Don.  Yeah.  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Are you in a good mood today, Don?  Yeah.  You know, I said I'd check for this blindfold, man.  They put...  Got me blindfolded.  I can't see where I'm going.  They put blindfolds on you guys?  Yeah.  Come on.  That is...  Yeah, man.  I got my hands tied, too, man.  He's holding the phone in my ear.  Okay.  Thank you, Don. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  I have no idea where I'm going, you know.  You guys could be taking me to Cuba, for all I know.  No.  It's what it is.  We're going to give you $102 to spend any way you want in that fine mall.  Yeah.  Short Hills Mall.  Okay.  And a bunch of our faithful listeners are going to join you guys there, and I believe they're  going to give you change and stuff, too.  All right?  Okay, man.  Well, have fun, Don.  All right.  I will.  Thanks.  All right, buddy.  Hmm.  All right.  All right, guys.  That's Don.  Okay.  And, uh, yeah, the other guys are pretty much sacking out.  Ziggy is, uh, sacked out in the back there. 
[01:23:00]  I think he's, like, claimed the back corner of the bus room.  Holy crap!  What?  Did you see that?  That guy almost hit a parked car.  One of the guys in a blue pickup was waving to us, waving his arm out the window.  He almost hit a parked car.  Oh, man.  Holy crap.  You guys got a whole caravan.  Yeah, we got a whole freaking caravan.  All right.  It's like celebrities driving down the road.  I think it could be the music from the cheese pipe or something that's, uh, leaves everybody 
[01:23:30]  down there.  Rick, how long before you get to Short Hills Mall?  I guess about 10, 12 minutes until we get to Short Hills Mall.  Okay.  The oasis of luxury.  All right.  We'll, uh, check in with you soon, all right?  All right.  You got it, guys.  All right, man.  I want to go to Ben, who's in the FM Talk van, who's right behind the homeless bus.  What's up, Ben?  We got a huge caravan following us.  We got a bunch of guys in a, uh, in a black pickup that are right behind us.  And we are on the way to the Short Hills Mall.  Everybody's waving to us.  Huge crowd behind us. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, cool.  All right.  Everybody, meet them there at Short Hills, and, uh, you can watch the homeless shop.  Yeah, we want a welcome committee at the Short Hills Mall.  So when you see the bus start beeping and waving, and welcome, uh, our homeless people to the  fine mall of, uh, Short Hills, okay?  Anything else, Ben?  That's about it.  We're having fun.  Big crew behind us.  We're ready to get to the mall and go shopping.  All right, cool.  Thank you.  Okay.  All right, there goes Ben.  I want to see a gray wolf go into glamour shots. 
[01:24:30]  And have, uh, a little, a little glamour shot taken.  Wouldn't that be neat?  That would be funny, man.  Come on.  All right, Ed.  Things are shaping up.  Peace pipe.  Now, this is, uh, critical time here.  Yeah.  Now that we have announced that it is Short Hills Mall, uh, let's see if we'll make it  into the mall, Anthony.  Yeah.  Gonna have to cross, uh, battle lines, I think.  Yes, and we'll check in with Rick right after these.  Stay there.  Dudes with dudes.  Well, I think every time we open our mouths, we're, we're, we're, we're pissing someone 
[01:25:00]  off.  We'll be an Anthony.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're out of control.  We're so wacky.  All right, knock it off.  One, oh, two, seven.  Anthony, we're in the middle of, uh, commercials, but we gotta break in.  Yeah.  Yeah, because, uh, the homeless bus has arrived.  All right.  At Short Hills Mall for the homeless shopping spree.  An oasis of luxury.  Minutes from Manhattan.  Oh, the Short Hills Mall.  And, uh, a ton of our faithful listeners are making their way to the mall as we speak.  There's a welcoming committee there, I'm hearing. 
[01:25:30]  So let's go to the phone now and talk to Rick, who's on the homeless bus.  All right.  Guys, we are here.  All right, Rick.  And we are on location at the Short Hills Mall, right in front of Houlihan's, near Neiman Marcus.  The staff of Houlihan's just came running out to greet us.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  We got a bunch of listeners with Stamp Out Racism signs.  Help 0&A Stamp Out Hunger.  I mean, people are just here supporting us in grand scale.  We got more people pulling up. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, look, security guards are running over.  All right.  That's why we have the 0&A security detail talking to those guys right now.  Okay.  Ready for the guys to come off the bus.  They didn't even make it off the bus.  It was security guards.  Hey, Rick, are they ready to leave the bus?  Yeah, in just about a moment, we're going to be bringing everybody off the bus.  All right.  And introduce them to the wonderful world of shopping here at the Short Hills Mall.  Why don't you have each guy maybe say, you know, hi, you know, through the phone as they're walking off the bus, you know, what their name is and that, okay? 
[01:26:30]  You can introduce them to the whole radio audience.  Ask what they think maybe they want to be buying in some of these stores.  Yeah.  I want to rent one of them.  All right.  All right.  Hold on a second.  Okay.  Here we go with the first guy.  What's your name again, sir?  Neil Armstrong.  Thomas, what do you think you're going to buy today when you get into Le Mans?  Usually something.  All right.  Thomas isn't sure exactly.  He knows there's a lot of different stores to pick from.  I think he sees whole hands and realizes beer. 
[01:27:00]  They're all going to stop there.  They're not going any further than whole hands.  Did you have to park them in front of a bar?  Oh, he did.  It was the best place.  They had a welcoming committee.  Oh, my God.  What's your name again?  Grey Wolf.  It's Grey Wolf.  Oh, Grey Wolf.  What are you going to be buying when you get in there?

Oh, look out!  Where's Marco?  Call up, Marco.  You got another load of baby batter in you?  Does Marco have another load of baby batter ready to go?  People couldn't believe that.  I thought you were actually gay. 
[01:32:00]  I thought you were a gay guy.  No, how much money you got?  I don't know how much money you got.  Between that and your love for the middle Hanson child.  Oh, that kid's hot.  What do you want?  You're going to tell me that kid's not hot?  People not really know it.  You know how hard it is to get a cab in Manhattan at 430?  I stole a bike to get here.  Well, we appreciate that, Jack.  I saw a bike in one of them old, like, fashion chains with the combination lock.  I was like, I can fit this out loud.  The Asian bicycle delivery guy.  I went to junior high.  So, I got some Chinese food here. 
[01:32:30]  You guys stopped on the front.  You kicked the Chinese guy off his bike to get here.  I like these calves.  They got bulletproof glass between you and the driver.  Yeah.  Glass that'll stop a bullet.  But somehow it doesn't stop that smell from making it.  You guys are like, where do you want to go?  I'm like, off wind.  Why don't you take me to the river and you can swim to giant stadium in the back?  It's nice that you've got the heat on in a wool suit.  What do you like, dressing up for your job?  All I see is the back of your head and your right arm.  Just wear a bathing suit and some speed stick. 
[01:33:00]  Stinky bastard.  I want Jim.  Hey, if anybody's out there going to see comedy, make sure you go see Jim Brewer.  Look at you, plugging Jim.  Because I feel bad that Jim's mad at me because of that show in Boston.  That's what it was, Joe?  Hi, everybody.  It's cold.  It's nothing from SNL or anything?  All right.  Hold that thought, Joe.  Rick.  All right.  Yeah.  What's up?  We're bringing the guys off the bus.  We're about to go.  They're chanting for Ziggy. 
[01:33:30]  Ziggy is the little, fat, homeless guy who smells so bad.  He's standing at five feet tall.  Ziggy.  The most pathetic of the homeless.  They couldn't broadcast.  I wish we were.  They didn't have any broadcast facilities for us at the Short Hills Mall.  All right.  Coming up now.  Here we go.  Our next guy is Frankie.  Number what number? 
[01:34:00]  Number one.  Oh, we put numbers on him.  Number zero.  Yeah.  They all have their homeless shirts on.  Zero, double zero, triple zero.  All right.  Up next.  Number two.  It's Jose.  Hooray.  What a shot.  Jose is hooked on tequila we found out today.  Loves his tequila.  That's why he's homeless.  That's impressive.  All right.  Everybody here.  Ten.  Number eight.  Number eight.  Who's cheering?  The fans?  Yeah.  A bunch of our listeners are down there.  Number nine.  Number nine.  You guys should have hired Bob Shepard from the Yankees. 
[01:34:30]  Number seven.  Number seven.  We got Keith.  Number four.  Wow.  I love him in the engine.  And finally we got Snoop with no number.  He's just running on out.  They love Snoop.  Look at the picture of this chick.  Libby Dolph.  Libby Dolph.  Rick.  Very good, Rick. 
[01:35:00]  All right, guys.  We are just about ready to jump in here.  We got to get into the mall now because they're going to arrest us.  We got, we're causing too many problems here.  How many?  Get in there.  How many people are around?  It's up to, it's probably about 150, close to 200 now.  It's people coming out of the mall to greet us.  We got like five security guards now with their trucks.  We would like to rent a homeless person.  We got guys wanting to rent homeless people to help them chaperone and get them shopping.  Hey, Rick, make sure Ziggy tries on some shoes as well with that nice suit. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, my God.  Hey, Ziggy, Nordstrom is good for shoes.  You want to try there?  Nordstrom, shoes.  Good?  Yay!  I don't know why I got shoes on.  All right.  He got shoes on.  That's all he needs.  He's had the same shoes since 75.  Why does he care?  He's already told the way back to the highway.  Oh, wow.  What's wrong?  What's wrong, Rick?  We got the state police moving up because we're back.  Get in the mall.  Get in the mall.  Run.  Yeah, get in the mall.  Get in the mall.  Get in the mall, guys.  We'll talk to you in a bit.  All right, cool. 
[01:36:00]  Don't walk.  Run.  Bye.  Bye.  There they go.  Everybody.  Really?  They'll be turned away.  Oh, my God.  It's bedlam.  We have a few listeners, Jay.  All right.  Oh, my God.  The homeless shopping spree is off to a fine start, Anthony.  That is fantastic.  And you know what's great?  It's a write-off for you guys.  You can talk about it.  You guys can get some nice leather jackets and stuff.  You can write it off.  You can get it on the show.  That's what I do about my act.  I talk about my Rolex for 10 minutes. 
[01:36:30]  You can write it off.  It's paid for, man.  Let me tell you something about the people at Rolex.  It's professional.  I have to do it.  Oh, we're very excited.  The phones are just going nuts.  Man, also, the listeners that are going to be following them through the mall, that's  just going to be like, what a scene.  I'm not going to be kicking the nuts at all.  Somebody will do it.  Hey, look.  It's for Jay Moore.  Let's talk to Mush real fast.  Mush, you work at Short Hills Mall?  No, I don't work at Short Hills Mall, but I do some services once in a while. 
[01:37:00]  I'm not saying exactly what I do for sake of my job, but they are the most stuck-up people  in the world.  That's why we picked Short Hills Mall.  Let's put it this way.  I had a call up there one day to see what their problem was.  They just had the name of the business.  It didn't say they were in the Short Hills Mall or anything.  I call them up, and I'm talking to them.  I was like, yeah, just to make sure before I get out there, you're in the Short Hills Mall,  right?  He goes, no, sir.  We're in the mall at Short Hills.  I was like, well, you have a good day because I'm not coming out. 
[01:37:30]  All right.  We picked the perfect mall then.  Yep.  You guys, I hope they have a good time.  Hey, I have a few friends that work there as well, so have them stop at Bloomingdale's  in the perfume department.  Well, these guys need to be sprayed down, so that's not a bad idea.  All right.  Thank you.  They should bother that homeless smell and sell that.  Uh-oh.  I'd sample that.  What chair are you sitting on, Jay?  I don't know.  I swear to God.  Is that the chair Ziggy was sitting in?  Is that the chair over there?  Oh, God.  Okay.  We sprayed it down with light bulb.  I like you. 
[01:38:00]  That's why.  It just dawned on you that I might be sitting in a chair that is like, I don't understand  what was sitting in that chair.  Ziggy cereal.  So friggin' bad.  Like, we're taking that chair out of the building with us tonight.  We have it laminated.  Hey, I listened.  I was driving from upstate New York, Delhi, all the way down here, and I listened.  And you guys had those two chick cops in, and that was some of the best radio.  Oh, he beat the crap out of us, man.  Yeah, but Anthony was an animal.  I was trying.  The resisting arrest show.  Yeah.  I was a puss. 
[01:38:30]  I was really trying.  What would happen if you just turned around and punched him in the face?  You know what?  They would beat the living crap out of you.  They stepped on the nuts.  I was hurting, man.  Yeah.  They get that one cuff on you, and then twist it so it's working like a ratchet on your wrist.  I was in pain.  Finally, you just say, all right, I give, I give.  Enough.  Rick had a bloody nose.  I heard Rick was a pit bull.  Yeah.  Yeah, Rick was really tearing him up.  Then the one chick grabbed his sack and started squeezing and put her knee right in his face.  And he started bleeding.  It was great, man. 
[01:39:00]  He had a bloody nose from having his balls, Grant?  What kind of wiring does he have?  That's a weird wiring job, man.  I can understand it running a little bit.  It was a wild show, though.  Grab my balls.  Watch my nose bleed.  I'm a weirdo.  Jim, real fast, what do you have, man?  Yeah, I left work early today because I knew you guys were going by the Short Hills Mall,  and I got to go by there on my commute.  Yeah.  And you could just see the cars backing up into the entrance of the mall.  Oh, cool. 
[01:39:30]  The bus was there.  Yeah.  And I called my wife.  I said, I'm coming home early because I'm not getting stuck in that crap.  Right.  And I'll tell you, the one guy who called up was all, because I live in a town next to  the mall, and the guy said it was so, so great, these guys coming out to the rich suburban  territory.  Yeah.  Tomorrow they're going home.  Tomorrow we're still rich.  All right.  In that guy's face.  Whatever.  Yeah, way to scoreboard for you.  Oh, you're homeless, and I'm rich.  Right.  What a nice guy.  What a jackass. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, well, tomorrow I'll still be rich and white and afraid of blacks and Puerto Ricans.  And I'll live in my little gated community, and you'll still be homeless.  Choked on you, homeless guy.  Holy Jesus.  You showed him.  Scoreboard, rich guy one, homeless guy nothing.  Yeah, but the homeless guy's on the radio.  All right.  Hold on.  Uh, I'm not going there. 
[01:40:30]  Marco's on the line.  No.  Oh, look at that.  Let me talk to Mike real fast.  Mike, what's up?  Real fast.  What's up, fellas?  All right.  My wife and I, we make about $150,000 between two of us, and we went to Short Hills with my  son.  Yeah.  And they were looking at us like we were trash.  Oh, really?  So screw them all.  What color are you, Mike?  Destroy them all.  Mike, what color are you?  I'm white.  Oh, you sound like a black guy.  All right.  All right, man.  Thank you.  All right.  You guys rock.  All right.  He sounded like a brother, didn't he?  Uh, Mark. 
[01:41:00]  You know what I went down to Short Hills Mall.  Right.  You're on the spread.  Man, flavor, and you need to put a few pounds.  You know what I'm saying?  Let's check in with Psycho Mark, who's at Short Hills Mall as well.  Psycho Mark.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  We're in Neumann Marcus right now with some of the boys, and we're shopping around for  some fine gifts for Christmas.  Neumann Marcus.  Can I tell you, they welcomed us here at the mall.  The head guy from security said that we're entirely welcome here at the Short Hills Mall. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, really?  We're able to shop, so everyone's welcome and happy, and the guys are very happy.  So what are you guys looking for?  Anything in particular?  Not really, just feel what the best value is around here.  I don't know what he's going to get for.  Is it BK?  Value.  Best value.  You want to supersize that for $33 extra?  The crowd was unbelievable outside.  Yeah.  They're not following you around in the mall right now?  Yeah, we've got a small crowd following us around with us. 
[01:42:00]  Mostly people staring at us.  But one of the salespeople has come to help us.  Yeah, none of the salespeople have come to help us.  They don't want to help?  Well, I don't understand what that might be.  Well, Psycho Mark, who are you with right now?  What's your age again?  Okay.  I've got Jose.  I've got Jose.  And I've got Kent with me.  Well, have him just start trying on jackets and stuff.  Yeah, well, hey, now why don't you guys start trying on some nice stuff?  You just want to try on a nice shirt?  Oh, no.  I think that looks awful. 
[01:42:30]  We've got some Tommy Bahama shirts over here.  They look really nice.  I think you guys would look good.  Yeah, definitely try something on because I think there's not enough people staring at us.  I think we should start at some more.  Oh, here's a salesperson over here.  We have some great shirts, you said?  And what's your name?  And we've got Simon here.  And he's kind enough to help us out.  My name is Simon.  And, yeah, if you wouldn't mind coming and helping some of these gentlemen, that'd be great. 
[01:43:00]  Here we go.  What once you try on one of these nice shirts?  I think that's gorgeous.  I think that would look fabulous.  Jose's trying on a shirt right now.  Jose needs a pretty big shirt.  For a homeless guy, he's pretty fat.  Hey, Mark.  Mark, make sure they remove the...  Hey, Mark.  Yeah.  Jay has something for you.  Jay Moore.  This is just a technicality.  What did you say, Jay?  This is a technicality.  Make sure they remove the clothing they have on before they try on the new clothes. 
[01:43:30]  Don't just layer them up.  Don't make them dress in layers.  Get them naked.  I want to see homeless titties.  You said Jose's fat.  That's something I don't understand.  How could homeless people be fat?  They're freaking homeless.  Ever seen a homeless guy in the park with muscles?  How do they get muscles when they're homeless?  I go to the gym every day.  I can never break 160.  I'm 160 pounds my whole life.  That's the homeless guy who's all ripped up.  How much does that cardboard box weigh? 
[01:44:00]  He's working it, man.  He's shopping.  What's the problem?  How do we find it at the store?  He's looking for another store.  I think Neiman Marcus is a little too snooty for his taste.  Well, one of the homeless guys walked out of Neiman Marcus?  I've had it.  With six Donna Karan suits under his head.  I can't shop here again.  We are getting stared at.  You would not believe the stares we are getting.  Hey, Mark. 
[01:44:30]  Why don't you talk to one of the snooty people and ask them what they're staring at?  Yeah, exactly.  Excuse me, ma'am.  Have you ever seen any homeless people like this shopping in a mall before?  No.  Never?  Are you from New Jersey?  Yeah.  You are from New Jersey.  What do you think about the homeless people shopping in Neiman Marcus?  Good for them.  It's good for them.  She likes it.  So there you go.  I'm very happy.  All right.  She's happy, all right.  Can I ask her a question?  We'll check in in a little bit.  We're going to go to another store and see if we can stir up a little bit more of some snootiness.  Hey, go find Santa Claus, man. 
[01:45:00]  You've got to get some of these guys sitting on Santa's lap, right?  All right, guys.  We'll check back in.  All right, man.  Bye.  There goes Psycho Mark.  I hope you guys have some video done.  Oh, we're having a guy's videotaping the whole thing.  Oh, man.  Actually, Comedy Central wants this.  You have to have it.  We've got like two video cameras rolling.  All right, listen.  We've got to take a quick break.  Do you want to talk to Marco again, your gay lover?  He's on line tag.  You know what?  I think the listeners want me to talk to Marco again.  That's all I hear about.  All right.  All right.  Marco's up next with Jay Moore.  We and Anthony. 
[01:45:30]  Lots of crap going on today.  We've got Jay Moore in the studio as well.  He was eating at Paisano's last night, right, Jay?  That's right.  I come out of the bathroom at Paisano's, and this girl comes up to me and goes, will you  do me a favor?  I go, yeah.  She says, my friend just got here from Israel.  She thinks you're Jay Moore.  Will you go over and say hi and just tell her you are?  I go, all right.  She goes, do you get that a lot?  I go, once in a while.  My brother gets it a lot.  I go, I have a twin brother that looks more like him than I do.  I go, how are you doing? 
[01:46:00]  I'm Jay Moore.  And she goes, hi.  I go, she goes, I really like your show action.  I go, you get that in Israel?  She goes, no, I was in Germany.  I watched it in Germany.  In Germany?  Yeah.  We're like number one in England and Germany.  Great.  I'm serious.  No, that is great.  It means I get more money.  Oh, really?  But you can't do a new episode.  Yeah.  That's all right.  You think anyone else will pick up the show?  I hope not.  I'm done.  You don't want to do it now?  No, we made 13, like gangsters, 13, making an indelible mark on the landscape and you  ride off into the sunset.  And you leave.  No one did a better show than that. 
[01:46:30]  Peace.  We're out of here.  Cool.  Yeah, that was good.  Thank you, Paul.  What are you doing, movies now?  I'm trying to get a movie.  I can't get arrested.  Come on, get out of here.  I'm telling you.  You don't think that'll affect your career?  I'm not going to be like an actor on a Seymour Butts home portal.  You better stop hanging out with us.  No, that would be like, I bet I would get a million dollars if I did a porno.  You probably would.  Why don't you do it?  Just for a goof.  For a goof.  You know what?  You know, I would totally do porno, but you know, there's variables like AIDS. 
[01:47:00]  And then there's AIDS.  And then there's AIDS.  All right.  You want to check in with Psycho Mark again?  You want to talk to one of the snooty people at the shortness wall, right?  Psycho Mark's doing a good job.  He's great.  Better than Rick at Moral.  Today's not a good day, Jay.  We have a lot going on.  Yeah.  Really?  Open in.  He's on me anytime.  I thought I was a friend of the show.  Yeah, but not today.  From now on, you just show up, all right?  He's your producer.  I got a little jealous.  I got a little jealous.  We don't even want to know when you're coming. 
[01:47:30]  You just show up in the door.  All the time we're talking, it's like, hey, look, it's Jay Warren.  Okay.  Psycho Mark at Short Hills Mall.  Psycho Mark, what's going on?  We just went into Versace and instead of seeing the faces, they thought we were a Martian  stepping off a spaceship.  We have a crowd of got to be at least three or four hundred people following us all around.  They have never seen anything like it in the entire world.  And it is just unbelievable. 
[01:48:00]  People are just absolutely shocked.  Are a lot of pictures and video being taken for the website?  Yeah, I'm taking a ton of pictures.  Some great pictures.  Actually, we're not allowed to take pictures in the mall, but we're sneaking a few of them  here and there.  We're in a museum.  No flash photography?  Yeah, really.  You should see some of the snobby people here.  They cannot believe that we are actually here.  Well, listen, you've got to find a snobby person because Jay Moore wants to talk to them.  All right.  Hold on.  We'll see if we can find a snobby person. 
[01:48:30]  And remember, no flash photography during the dramatic Orange Julius section.  Hold on.  The mall at Short Hills.  Everyone keeps walking away from me.  I'm like I have a disease.  All right.  You do.  Marco, I'll check in with you in a sec.  We've got Rick on the other line, man.  All right.  There's a ton of people with cell phones in the Short Hills mall.  They're all following Ziggy around.  You want to talk to one of them real fast?  Oh, yeah.  And then we'll go to Rick.  Rick, hold on a sec.  Brandon, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  I'm following Ziggy right now.  Yeah?  What is he doing with his money? 
[01:49:00]  Him and Graywolf just went into a card shop and they were buying cards.  Buying cards, huh?  Like birthday cards?  I don't know, but...  Like birthday cards?  Christmas.  I don't know.  I couldn't get close enough, man.  There's a crowd and a half behind him.  Yeah, that's what everyone's saying.  Jesus.  All right.  Thank you, Brandon.  No problem.  All right.  Another guy following Ziggy.  George, what's going on?  Oh, what's up?  I want to say hello to Anthony.  You're on the air.  What's up?  Oh, my God.  It's so cute, man. 
[01:49:30]  It's crazy.  Mothers are grabbing their kids.  It's ridiculous, man.  We have taken over Short Hills Mall, man.  We should have went, man.  The revolution!  We've got a revolution!  Get us a helicopter.  We want to get to Short Hills Mall immediately.  God, we should have went, man.  I know.  I know.  It's taken us, man.  There's so many people here.  There's about four.  There's like 300 people here.  All following these guys around.  It's so funny.  All these snobby people are walking around, looking all over.  What the hell's going on?  What's going on here?  They have no idea what's going on.  They keep losing Ziggy.  Ziggy keeps wandering off all over the place. 
[01:50:00]  We've got Rick right here.  He's right next to me.  I'm on right now.  Get Ziggy the phone.  Yeah, we're in Foot Locker, I think we are.  Oh, are you?  We're just walking around.  Many odor eaters.  It's like mad people all over the place.  Well, get Ziggy to try on some snakes, man.  Where's Ziggy?  Yeah, get Ziggy on the phone.  I want to talk to him real fast.  I can't believe that a guy's wandering from shop to shop.  Yeah, Ziggy.  Stay with open, Anthony.  Jay, talk to Ziggy.  Hey, Anthony has the same name as me, Ziggy. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, Ziggy.  He's got a couple coffees.  Hey, Ziggy.  You want to talk to Snoop?  Yeah, let's talk to Snoop.  Ziggy's hard to keep on the phone.  Snoop's a white guy.  Yeah.  Snoop!  Open back!  Snoop!  Open, Anthony, want to talk to you?  Yo, yo, yo, boy!  Hey, what's going on?  What's going on?  Hey, Snoop, have you bought anything yet?  What's the best thing in the world is?  Donation.  What's the best thing in the world?  Generosity.  That's right.  All right, thank you, George.  My God.  Let's go to Rick.  Rick.  Guys.  What's going on, buddy? 
[01:51:00]  We're in Foot Locker, as you know.  Yeah.  And we just had our first two purchases.  Okay.  The chief picked up a nice carousel, Christmas carousel,  that he got from the Carlton Card Bookstore.  And also, Snoop picked up something for his mom.  What did he get for his mom?  He got a nice, like, heart-shaped thing, a glass thing.  It's pretty nice.  I don't know what it's called, but it's pretty cool.  How can you be homeless with a mom?  That you would buy a present for?  Yeah, because you can't sleep on her couch. 
[01:51:30]  Like, you know how many bridges you have to burn to become homeless?  I mean, then he's on four consecutive holidays.  You came home, took a dump in the fish tank, and had sex with your father.  I mean, that's what you got to do.  When you go like, hey, I'm homeless.  Can I crash?  No!  Don't ever come here!  Hey, how do you guys like that?  You like that?  You want that?  Oh, man, you're hilarious.  Hey, Rick.  Yeah?  Is it true you guys got, like, three or four hundred people following you?  Yeah.  It's real difficult to try and keep these guys in line, 
[01:52:00]  because everybody's running off offering them money.  We're hoping they get lost, man.  That number's going to double.  Huh?  Oh, we got one guy that's going to try on a nice jacket here, a footlocker.  But he's got to take his shirt off to try the jacket on.  Yeah.  Rick, what you need to do is get Ziggy in a seat and have him try on some fine Nike.  All right, yeah.  He's just poking around with the shoes and trying to figure out which ones he likes.  Okay.  All right?  So, let's see.  He's kind of pondering at a couple of shoes there. 
[01:52:30]  All right.  Hold on.  He's looking at a pair of Nike.  Just grab some British Nights off the rack.  Right.  Hey, Zig, what are you looking at here, man?  I've got some of the shoes.  You like some new shoes?  No, they smell good.  They smell good.  Anything smells good.  Yeah.  Imagine what his smell like.  You don't want shoes, dude?  I don't need any.  No, come on.  Try on a pair.  You like these?  They're going to be free.  They're going to be free.  What size are you?  People are offering to buy things for them, I guess. 
[01:53:00]  I don't know many, though.  It's changing.  It depends on the...  All right.  If I get the shoe size, it depends on how many socks you're stuffing in there.  No.  All right, Ray.  There's a sale guy over here.  What size are you?  Oh, they're free.  Hold on.  Let me go.  Yeah, we're going to go see Sam.  Make sure he takes his socks off to try on new socks and shoes.  You've got to get body parts out in the open so these guys can really stink.  All right.  Bare, sweaty, stinky skin.  That guy's feet are so air. 
[01:53:30]  Actually, it looks like he's been kicking flour.  Ryan, I need a pair of shoes here for Viggy.  Hold on.  Let's see.  I think we need...  This isn't like a size six or a size seven?  How big?  That's small.  What?  What is it, midget?  Nine and a half is your small?  You got anything in a six and a half in black?  No, get him a nine and a half.  He has enough layers of socks.  He's got to be able to shove, yeah, more socks and some newspapers in there.  Try seven and a half or eight.  Yeah.  How small are this guy's feet? 
[01:54:00]  How does that happen?  He looks like a little fidget guy.  He's a little guy, yeah.  But, yeah, we're getting him a pair of shoes to try on.  A lot of people are here.  They're totally cool, man, here at Short Hills.  The guys, people are offering to buy themselves so they can save some cash and buy some other stuff later.  Hey, Rick, it's Jay.  How much money did you pocket so far?  I'll give it to him.  Give it to me.  Hey, I'll give it to him.  You jerk off.  I can't wait for the fight club between Jay Moore and Rick.  It'll happen all these days. 
[01:54:30]  It'll happen.  Okay, Frank's got a pair here.  All right.  He's got a pair of running shoes.  But take the socks off.  The socks have been shopping, too.  Yeah, I can imagine.  I run up on something.  Is he going to try the shoes on or what?  Yeah, he's going to try the shoes on, right?  But the socks have got to come off.  He's got a box in hand.  He's going to try them on right now.  All right.  Very good.  Socks have to come off.  Yeah, I'm just going to take the socks off.  Yeah.  I was going to get a pair of sneakers. 
[01:55:00]  They fit great, man.  This is great.  I loved it.  All right.  Very good.  All right, guys.  You heard it.  We're here in Foot Locker at the Short Hills Mall.  We've got about 300 people outside the store.  All right.  You've got to find Santa, man.  All right.  We're going to go to Santa.  Plus, we've got an offer from Mrs. Fields Cookies.  They're going to give us, like, 25% off all their cookies.  Very nice.  Cool.  They're not giving free cookies.  Hey, Rick, get a bunch of the guys into Macy's and let the girls spray them down with some  perfume and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Cool.  Make over the next. 
[01:55:30]  All right, man.  Bye.  It's going quite well, our homeless shopping spree, Anthony.  I love the generosity just pouring out from the people.  At the Short Hills Mall.  I think Spaz farted behind you because he's waving it off.  What the hell, Spaz?  It stinks enough in here.  Ah, Spaz, man.  In the office after the show yesterday.  He's sitting there.  He's just blasting farts out.  What do you think?  People enjoy the smell of your ass?  Yeah.  Dude, come on.  Speaking of enjoying the smell of an ass, let's talk to Marco.  All right.  Man, man.  We have time. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, we have time.  Screw it.  Ah, Marco.  Hold on.  Marco.  Jay.  Hi, baby.  Hi.  Doesn't even want to address you or I.  Hi, baby.  Hello?  Yeah, Marco.  It's Jay.  How you been, baby?  Is the train of shows been canceled?  It's been canceled, honey.  That's it?  I'm like nervous talking to you again.  You're nervous?  Where are you now?  I'm just sitting in a car.  I'm late for work, actually.  They put me at home for a while.  You're going to be a little later when you pull over to the side of the road and take your  hog out. 
[01:56:30]  I already took it out.  You already took it out?  Yeah.  What's it look like?  Are you circumcised?  Yeah, I'm circumcised.  How long?  How big is it?  It's a good six inches.  What do you measure from the asshole?  Jay.  Last time was amazing.  It was amazing.  Do it to me again.  No, you do it to me, honey.  You want me to do it to you?  I watched a porn the other night.  I think his name was like Phil Penta or something like that.  Yeah, that's my porn name.  And you made pretend it was me? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  How's Opie's ass today?  Easy, Marco.  Keep me out of this one, Marco.  Marco, why are you going there?  I'm taking a nice pork sword, Opie.  Easy.  That's one way to get off the air, Marco.  Marco, if you want to stay in the air, I don't want you floating around with eyes for other  men.  I want eyes only for my ass.  Sierra ass?  Come on.  Did you say Marco?  I knew it wasn't Marco.  I'm like an Italian guy.  It didn't sound like the same love. 
[01:57:30]  That's all right, though.  The real Marco, we'll call it.  All right, we've got to take a quick break.  That was disappointing.  It was.  I was getting excited.  You could tell right from the beginning, though, he didn't sound like the same guy.  Well, at first, he sounded scared, like, oh, my God.  I got through.  Then I kept telling you, like, the Italian accent coming through.  Marco was, like, Puerto Rican or something.  Look at this Pat guy from Brooklyn.  That isn't Marco.  He knew right away.  You know, that's Marco's lover.  You're too preoccupied.  I'm with Marco now.  I'll pick it up.  I got it fast.  We're back at the Short Hills Mall. 
[01:58:00]  Psycho Mark.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Oh, we're in here shopping for shoes, and Ziggy is just causing a major disturbance in here.  He's got a coat on.  He's got a brand-new hat, and he's trying on some shoes.  It's just an absolute scream.  There's got to be 150, 200 people jammed in this door here, at least.  I just got chipped off.  There's a candy store right across from the shoe store.  The girl said if we walk over there, she's going to physically throw us all out. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah, so I'm trying to round up a couple of the boys so I can go for candy.  Hey, Mark, this is...  Hey, Mark.  Yeah?  This is Jay.  You have a constitutional right to walk wherever you damn well please.  Absolutely.  What'd you say?  You have a constitutional right to walk wherever you damn well please.  I have a constitutional right to go buy candy if we want to.  All right.  So why don't you buy the candy right now while we're on the air, man? 
[01:59:00]  All right, hold on.  All right.  Let's go candy shopping.  There it is.  Come on.  This is the best radio show in the world.  Grab Ziggy.  Ziggy's still shopping.  Ziggy needs some kind of mint candy under his armpit.  I'm peppermint fatty, I mean.  I'm peppermint fatty.  Come on, let's go over the candy store.  You're peppermint fatty.  My diabetes gets sick.  There's thousands of people here.  It is absolutely...  Hey, you guys listen to Opie Anthony? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah!  It's absolutely madness.  Absolutely madness.  Hey, hey, Mark, Mark.  Yeah?  On your way to the candy store, get everybody chanting.  Candy, candy, candy.  Hey, we're going to all start yelling candy.  Candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy.  Candy, candy, candy, candy.  Oh, I'm trying to look for my lady in the candy store.  Good.  She is not happy.  Well, get her... 
[02:00:00]  Can we come over and shop in here?  Oh, wait a minute.  He's not very happy.  Here comes the voice.  It's like candy.  Hey, Mark, get the candy lady on the phone.  Give it up.  All right, hold on a second.  Oh, there she goes.  We've got to get them chanting candy.  Hey.  Can we talk to you for a second?  Yeah.  Yes, sir.  All right, hold on.  Here she is.  What's your name?  Here.  Now, what do you think about the homeless people shopping in the store here?  Nothing wrong with it.  No problem.  Good answer. 
[02:00:30]  No problem with it at all.  Hey, uh...  There's a rumor that they didn't want us in the candy store, but that's not true?  No, that's not true at all.  Hey, Mark.  We're more than welcome to come in.  They're people.  Everybody's a person.  Hey, Mark.  Well, there you go.  What's that, guys?  Mark, let Jay Moore talk to the fine candy lady.  All right, hold on.  You want to speak to Jay Moore?  He's a famous girl.  Hello?  What's your name, miss?  Amy.  Amy, we heard that you were going to physically throw out everybody from the candy store if they went over there.  Well, not the people involved, but if 500 people come in here, we don't have the capacity for 500 people to come in this store. 
[02:01:00]  Are you a sumo wrestler?  How are you going to throw out 500 people?  That's not the point.  No, the point is, 500 people, you should be happy for the business.  They will not fit in my store.  Well...  They will not fit in my store.  Hey, this is O.B. and Anthony, baby.  You watch.  They'll fit themselves in that store.  Don't get on the wrong side of O.B. and Anthony.  They'll wedge themselves in there like those kids in the phone booth in the 50s.  Amy, you sound like a sensible gal.  I say you just start...  I try.  You got candy canes, right? 
[02:01:30]  Yes.  Just start throwing them out to the masses.  Throw them out to the masses?  Amy, how old are you?  28.  Do you have a triangle or a mohawk?  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Answer the question.  Triangle, mohawk, or Abraham Lincoln?  Oh, my God.  Come on, honey.  Oh, my God.  Come on, baby.  I can't believe you just said that.  I can't believe I'm attracted to you and I never even saw you before.  No, you wouldn't be, trust me.  Oh, yes, I would be.  You'd be surprised, Amy.  She works at a candy store.  She probably dips into the profits, you know what I mean? 
[02:02:00]  She's dipping into the inventory.  No, not quite.  Triangle or mohawk?  Well, maybe you got to get a little triangle going, and that'll help your...  Triangle or mohawk?  Hey, don't get high on your own supply.  She's doing over there in the candy store.  Are you overweight?  Is that what you're talking about?  I don't want to talk to you anymore.  She probably is.  Hey, Mark.  Yeah?  Is she a heifer?  Yes.  He has a mustache.  All right, Mark.  We'll check in with you soon, all right? 
[02:02:30]  All right, guys.  Triangle mohawk or mustache?  You left that one out.  Let's check in with Ben real fast.  He's at another section of the mall.  Ben, what's going on?  We have like three cell phones going on.  Team reporting.  Ben, oh, now he's on this line.  You got to get guys in the helicopter.  Outside George Hill's mall.  Where?  I'm looking down on the parking lot.  There's each other.  Bye, bye, bye.  Oh, we're going down.  Hey, Ben.  Yeah, what's up?  We got you on the air, man.  What's going on?  I'm here with Thomas.  We just got some candy out of the candy shop.  Okay.  I was looking to get a Walkman here. 
[02:03:00]  But none of our listeners come to this mall, so nobody knows where we can get a Walkman.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  When are we going to Macy's to get the perfume?  Yeah, we need you guys to go to Macy's to get the perfume, man.  Macy's?  Yeah, we'll go to Macy's.  To get the free perfume and stuff, you know?  Yeah, we did that in Versace.  We went into Versace and got some cologne on us.  So we'll make our way to Macy's.  We'll give you a call.  Ben, how crazy is it at that mall right now?  It's so crazy.  We got a few hundred people with us right now.  You want me to have them screen prepared? 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, why not?  We've got security trying to move us here.  Ah, look.  They're ushering you along.  You have a constitutional right to stand there.  It's a peaceful assembly.  What's going on?  They're just trying to break the spurs of the crowd.  We literally have the whole hall blocked.  I mean, you can't get down the hall.  There's so many people following us all around.  So we're going to try and we're going to head towards Macy's, wherever Macy's is.  All right.  And I got our guys.  We'll call you back.  All right.  Thank you, Ben.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on one sec.  Hey, Ben. 
[02:04:00]  Ben.  Yeah.  Whenever you go, you have to get the crowd to chant about the place you're going.  If you're going to Macy's, you've got to get all 300 people walking going, Macy's, Macy's.  All right.  We'll do that.  Let's chant Macy's, guys, because we're heading to Macy's, right?  Macy's.  Macy's, Macy's, Macy's, Macy's, Macy's, Macy's, Macy's.  How's that, James?  Yeah, that's great.  I love it.  Awesome, Macy's.  We'll give you a buzz when we get there.  All right.  Thanks, Ben.  All right.  See you later.  Some guy is going to write about this in his class.  Dennis, what's going on? 
[02:04:30]  Hey, how you doing?  I'm on the air with Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, real fast.  Yeah, listen, fellas.  I've got to applaud you.  I teach consumer behavior and marketing at a northern New Jersey upper crust college.  And I've got students in my class that walk around with their pinkies extended all the time.  This is the best thing I have ever seen done to support what Thomas Jefferson said,  that we're all created equal.  All right.  I've got to compliment you guys, and I'm going to drill it into my people in class  and let them know that you guys have done a real public service to society.  All right.  Thank you, Dennis.  Applaud it.  Thomas Jefferson said that all people are created equal and go to the barn and have sex with a slave. 
[02:05:00]  That was the second half of that quote.  And let me get some of that black tail.  The black man will ring the bell.  There you go, Zaryl.  All right.  You guys want to check in with the Justice Department?  Make sure everything's on the up and up.  Juliana.  Hello.  What's up?  Hey.  I am quite teed off, actually.  Why?  Just because I think it is so unfair that there's actually troopers out there looking for you guys to stop this. 
[02:05:30]  They've been pretty cool.  Well, and at any time.  Wait, wait, wait.  I do have to stop you.  I've got to tell you, man.  All the cops and the troopers have been nothing but cool so far.  Yeah.  If you guys go in any store and they ask you to leave, I am fully prepared to back you guys up.  Look at these people.  Am I wrong or right?  You have a constitutional right.  It's peaceful assembly.  It is the Civil Rights Act of 1973, and they have to serve you no matter of race, color, religion. 
[02:06:00]  I hate that act.  Why do you hate that act?  I don't know.  There are some places I want to go and not be bothered by certain types.  I want to be there when you guys do your remotes from Harlem.  We're going to do that.  We are going to do that.  I'll be there.  All right, Juliana.  Well, keep close to the show.  We might need you from time to time, all right?  I am because it's, you know, I mean, just because, you know, people are, you know, doctors, attorneys or whatever.  Right.  Yeah, doesn't mean we don't have a sense of humor. 
[02:06:30]  All right, good.  And, you know, just because, I mean, everybody exploits somebody.  I mean, if you watch a talk show or whatever, you know, there's people exploited on that.  And, I mean, you guys are doing a good thing, personally, I think.  Well, all right.  Thank you, Juliana.  Okay.  Take care.  We'll talk to you soon.  Okay, bye.  Thanks a lot.  Let's check in with Psycho Mark one more time here.  Psycho Mark.  Yeah, I'm in Macy's right now.  Why are they really, really pissed off ladies to see at the makeup counter?  Really?  Let me talk to her.  She's not happy. 
[02:07:00]  Let me talk to her.  Let Jay Moore talk to her.  Tell her, Jay Moore.  Hold on, hold on.  Let me try and see.  Jay Moore is really good at smoothing things over.  Tell her, lip service is Jay Moore.  Smooth at things over.  Jay's great at smoothing things over.  We're just trying to find.  Guys, this is unbelievable.  People are just absolutely amazing.  We are at Short Hills Mall, just in case you're out of tune again.  That's where the homeless bus stopped today.  And you should stop by.  That's right.  It's not too late.  We'll be there for at least another hour.  Say hello.  Help the homeless shop.  There's plenty of room.  I'm going to have to call you guys back.  I can't seem to find her. 
[02:07:30]  All right.  I'll call you right back.  All right.  Thank you.  Go to the makeup counter.  Having one of the guys kind of lipstick.  Yeah.  Like one of those makeovers that they do.  A quick little makeover.  Brian is somewhere at Short Hills Mall.  Brian.  Hey, what's up?  What's going on?  Oh, man.  This is nuts out here, dude.  Really?  Yeah.  I wanted to call up.  See if you can get Rick to take him into Louis Vuitton.  The woman just walked up the stairs past me and my buddy Anthony.  Yeah.  And she's pissed.  She's screaming and yelling.  She's like, I don't want these effing people up here. 
[02:08:00]  There's like a hundred people outside.  I don't want this.  This is nuts.  You know, it's funny.  They're all mouthing off like that.  They don't want the people here and F them.  And if they come in here, I'll throw them out.  And then when you confront them and talk to them, oh, no, they are all welcome.  They read off the same script.  Everyone is welcome.  We are fine with anyone you want to bring in.  When we walked in, this woman was like, what's going on?  What's going on?  And my buddy Anthony goes, oh, it's from a radio show.  They're bringing homeless people in.  They gave them a hundred bucks to shop.  Yeah.  The woman looks them dead in the face and goes, and they brought them here? 
[02:08:30]  I think it's hilarious that all our listeners are in the mall with just cell phones all  over the damn place.  Meme coverage.  Meme coverage on the Opie and Anthony show.  Everyone's family with you guys.  Hell yeah.  This is great.  This is the best show I've ever heard of in my life.  Thank you.  Thank you, Jay.  Jay Moore, our only Hollywood friend.  I know.  I have nothing to plug.  I got no dates.  That's good.  Next time we're in L.A., would you like show us around?  Absolutely.  Are we on that level yet?  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah?  You got it.  All right.  We'll do a remote from my house. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, live broadcast.  Have some of my wife's hot friends come by.  That could be cool.  Yeah.  We could actually make that happen.  That would be funny.  Can we bring some of our homeless friends?  No.  To hit your house?  I don't believe in that amendment that later you're talking about.  I'm not a bunch of stinky people in my house.  Get out.  Let's take it.  I got a Rottweiler, so she'll sniff him out for me.  I won't even have to get off the couch.  The dog will be like, you're out, you're out.  She'll sniff Anthony.  Anthony might not even make it in.  I might not make it in.  Anthony might have a weird smell, too.  The dog might get rid of Anthony. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, man.  I want to keep taking breaks, but these guys are checking in like crazy.  Psycho Mark, you got anything else to report?  Yeah, I'm right.  But, you know, it's really funny, but cell phones seem to work perfectly inside this mall.  But anywhere else you go in the goddamn state, they don't work.  Yeah.  But, anyhow, I have a woman here at the...  Man, what do you think about what's going on outside?  Would you like to speak to Jay Moore on the phone?  He wants to talk to you.  You don't want to talk at all?  I have no comment.  No comment?  No comment whatsoever.  You snooty bitch. 
[02:10:00]  You're a snooty bitch.  You haven't had an orgasm since the Yankees had Ed Whitson.  Can I just talk to you on the phone real quick?  You better use it.  Yeah, Jay Moore wants to speak to you.  You don't want to talk to them?  All right.  All right.  Well, I...  I'll tell him he wants to, like, talk to Tom Cruise in a movie.  I'm sure she'll scream.  Ask her when was your last orgasm.  Jay Moore wants to know when was your last orgasm.  Jay Moore wants to know when was your last orgasm.  Okay, we'll do it.  Oh, I'm not getting a good look.  That is not a good look. 
[02:10:30]  She's having one right now.  There's alarms going off right now.  We've got an alarm going off.  Yeah, it's going off.  An alarm.  Oh, no.  I'm not getting everybody chanting, alarm.  Alarm.  Alarm.  Alarm.  I am going to do what I did at the hospital.  I'm going to disappear.  All right.  We'll check in with you soon, man.  All right.  There's so bad.  An alarm going off.  Oh, man.  Bye.  There's an alarm going off.  Oh, brother.  I don't have enough hands to high-five as many people as I want to high-five.  Why can't we just shop without alarms going off?  All right.  We are so late.  We've got to take a quick break, and we'll be back.

You gotta love setting the homeless loose in an exclusive mall.  New York has the best homeless.  L.A. have the worst homeless people.  First of all, they're tan.  I don't like any homeless guy that's got a better tan than me.  Yeah, yeah.  If there was like, would you have a homeless Olympics?  New York would send over the dream team.  You could have a whole decathlon.  The box lift, the cart push, the ticket dump in your pants, the nap, the squeegee relay, how 
[02:12:30]  many winter coats you can put on your back in the summertime.  Then you just have diving for fun.  The nap should be in freezing conditions, where the temperature slowly goes down, and you check  to see if the homeless are still having rapid eye movement.  Yeah, no, it's a nap slash nod.  Some of them are like, you know.  Like, oh, that would cost them.  You guys have a fat homeless guy.  I don't get it.  Yeah, we had a bunch of fat homeless guys. 
[02:13:00]  But how can you be fat and homeless?  I know.  Where do you get your food?  Come on, you're homeless.  We met a few chips and grapes.  We met them all before they got on the bus.  That must have been great.  The first few that came in were better dressed than Ant and I.  And we started getting bummed, but they were in a shelter.  I understand, but you're like, right.  Like, I'm dressed better than Opie today.  Yes, you are.  I have a cute little sweater on.  And then the ringers arrived.  The ringers?  Oh, man. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, yeah.  These guys were happy.  Ziggy and the Indian guy.  Let's check in with Rick.  He's in the middle of the mall.  Short Hills Mall is the homeless shopping spree.  What's going on, Rick?  Come on, dude.  Some guy just closed his shop.  This watch store saw us coming, and he closed his gate.  He won't let us in.  He closed the gate.  What kind of store is it, Rick?  As you can tell.  I love that chant. 
[02:14:00]  What is David Justice up?  And bringing in the reliever, John Rocker.  Here comes Chipper Jones with that.  As you can tell, the listeners are a little poor dog.  A-G-L-U.  A-G-L-U.  A-G-L-U.  Come on, man.  A-G-L-U.  A-G-L-U.  A-G-L-U.  Even Viggy's chanting.  He thinks that's the alphabet.  I can't understand why he's chanting, but he's chanting. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, man.  Instead, hey, Viggy, you want to go check out some Victoria's Secret stuff?  Oh!  Yeah.  Put him in a teddy.  All right.  He's never heard of her, but he wants to meet her.  All right.  Let's go check out some Victoria's Secret.  Hey, you've got to get them.  Hey, Viggy, Viggy.  It's patty time.  Viggy.  A little uncontrollable, over there.  There are so many people in the mall, so it's getting hard to hear these guys now.  They can't hear us.  Yeah. 
[02:15:00]  What's up, Rick?  Yeah, we're heading over to Victoria's Secret.  I think Viggy wants to try something in a classless number.  Oh, look at the women.  They're looking at us horrified.  Hi, ladies.  Hi.  Do you work here?  Yeah, I work here.  Do you want to help Viggy and some of our guys find some lingerie for the women in their lives?  Viggy one.  What do you need?  Yeah, what do you need?  Where's Viggy?  What do you need, sucker?  What do you need, man?  Viggy.  Viggy.  Viggy.  Viggy's just like a troll?  Yeah.

We have Jay Moore in the studio.  Big Hollywood star.  He wants to talk to you.  Are they kidding?  Are you kidding?  No, it's Jay Moore.  Michelle, hi, I'm Jay Moore.  Do you know who I am?  You're on high.  Do you watch any of my movies?  Jay Moore.  Okay.  I still get in trouble.  What?  She's too excited.  Her manager came to yell at her.  Let me talk to the manager. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, we're not going to take photographs.  We just want to help our guys shop.  Oh, boy.  Is the manager a guy or a girl?  And I think one of the sales girls wants to wow Ziggy.  Yeah.  We got to get some wowing going in the middle of Short Hills Mall.  What's wowing?  Hey, are there any ladies that want to wow the guys in our group here?  Very tough.  It's a hard Wednesday.  Yeah.  Come out.  Let's come out.  Let's come out.  This is in the middle of a friggin' mall, man.  It's a Short Hills Mall. 
[02:17:00]  Not any mall.  Yeah.  Short Hills Mall.  Nothing.  The other guy, nothing.  He goes, nothing.  I think Ziggy's going to see some boobies today.  Oh, yeah?  Is the manager a man or a woman?  It's a woman and she's hot.  Let me talk to her.  Tell her Jay Moore wants to talk to her.  All right.  Hold on.  I think she ran when they started screaming.  Knock on the door.  Let me find her.  Hey, where's your manager?  Hold on.  Jay Moore wants to talk to her.  Okay. 
[02:17:30]  Where's Tracy?  Does Jay Moore want to talk to her?  Oh, look.  Snoop is buying some fragrance products for the woman and his life.  Hey, there you go.  For the woman and his life.  For Scratchy down in the park.  Remember David Tell's joke?  He goes, I just went to this after-hours club called the Port Authority.  It was urine night.  God, see, he's funny doing David Tell's material.  I'd like to talk to Jay Moore from action.  The big Hollywood star?  The big Hollywood star.  Oh, she's not very happy. 
[02:18:00]  Uh-oh.  Just hand her the phone.  Yeah.  She doesn't even want to take the phone.  She's calling security now.  We're going to get some panties on her head.  All right, Jiggy, put some panties on your head for Christ.  No, no, no.  Put them on his crotch.  You can try them on right there in the store.  Tell them.  All right, guys.  Put on some panties here.  Hey, Chief.  Chief, don't light anything on fire, dude.  I'd be Chief to try on a nice flannel pajama set.  Chief.  Chief.  You want to try on some pajamas there, Chief? 
[02:18:30]  Me, try them for me.  How about the panties?  For the white.  Hey, Chief, ask him if you want to try on the sales girl.  He's picking up some large-breasted woman right next to her.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  I think he was doing a breast dance or something because those things are growing.  Holy Christ. 
[02:19:00]  Get Ziggy a banana hammock.  I think we've got Bush.  Sounds like we've got Bush.  As you can tell, the Chief has gotten wowed. 
[02:19:30]  He's gotten wowed.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  It is glorious day for the Indians.  Me, have a bone.  Very good.  He was doing the breast dance and it worked.  All right, Rick.  All right, guys, a second later.  You got it.  Hey, Rick.  What?  You're the best.  I'm not even mad at Rick anymore.  Oh, my God.  How could you be after that?  It's just a zoo at the Short Hills Mall.  This is the best show I've ever seen. 
[02:20:00]  It's insane today.  Every time I come on, the first time I came, a girl had her vagina pierced right in front  of me.  The second time I came, I got cousins tongue kissing and bumping donuts right in front of  me.  Something like that.  And now you've got to achieve getting boobs whipped out at her.  I haven't even had that.  In the middle of Short Hills Mall.  Let's check in with Psycho Mark.  He's at another part of the mall.  Oh, my God.  It's just spiraling downwards very quickly.  Uh-oh.  Why?  What's the problem?  Well, we were just all in Victoria's Secret.  There had to be 150 guys in there screaming, whip it out, whip it out, whip it out. 
[02:20:30]  We heard that because we had Rick on the phone for that.  Oh, Rick was beautiful.  The lady, the manager of the store, ran to the phone to call security.  And it was just outrageous.  Guys are grabbing panties left and right.  It was unbelievable.  And, of course, this dick comes in to try and show us their cans, and that just destroyed  everything.  So, people just don't know what to do here.  There's just, there's an absolutely amazing crowd.  And it's a lot of fun we're having here at the mall.  Is anybody asking any of the homeless guys to maybe sign up for a credit card for a discount 
[02:21:00]  before they buy their...  I guess not.  Are you on our mailing list?  What's your address?  Fifth Street.  I don't think that's been happening.  Is that an apartment or a residence?  It's not a Fifth Street, baby.  Hey, Mark, is the crowd growing?  What's that?  Is the crowd growing?  Oh, it's been growing like every minute.  I told you.  I said it was going to double.  10 to 20 people showing up.  There's people holding up signs across the way here.  Homeless celebrate Christmas, too. 
[02:21:30]  This guy says, Opie and Anthony rule.  And it's just a real scream.  We've got a lot of fans here.  All right.  And it's just unbelievable.  And...  All right, Mark, hold on the line, because this just in, the state troopers are on the way  to the mall.  Hold on.  Okay.  I'm going to go back to you in a sec.  Matt, you're next on FM Talk.  What's going on?  This is a pisser, guys.  Come on.  I'm on Route 24, just outside of Short Hills Mall.  And I just...  They're going the other ways.  About four trooper cars with their lights on, screaming towards the mall. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  I can see the riot gear rolling out already.  Oh, no.  There's no illegal activity going on.  No.  It's just the smelly, ziggy, and the...  They're just having fun.  The panties over the head, you know, that's what did it, I think.  All right, Matt.  They may be nudity.  They got arrested.  Good luck, guys.  Thank you.  They should arrest the girl that took out her can.  Right.  Hey, I'm well within my rights to be here, Cam, so I think you know that.  Uh-oh, the trooper's on the way.  Hey, Mark.  Yeah.  All right.  It's getting crazy, huh? 
[02:22:30]  Oh, it's absolutely mayhem.  It is complete mayhem.  It's just...  You've never...  I've never seen anything like it in my life.  The best was the guy who closed his door and wouldn't let us in.  So we all started screaming, asshole.  It sounded like the Yankee game, yeah.  It was rare.  Hey, I got an idea.  There's got to be a sporting goods store there, right?  Yeah.  Why don't you guys buy a soccer ball and get a little game going?  Let's go buy a soccer ball, everybody, and play a game downstairs.  Uh-oh.  The security's going over the ground. 
[02:23:00]  It's a grab here.  Excuse me.  Hey.  What's that guy in trouble?  Hold on, hold on.  The managers at Joe's said the guy's going there, they'll buy everything.  What's that?  Joe's, the restaurant.  They said they'll buy everything.  Joe's and Joe's restaurant said they'll buy everybody...  Bar and Grill.  Joe's Bar and Grill said they'd buy everybody food.  Hey, look at that.  How about that?  Hey, Joe's coming.  We'll put on over to Joe's for some free food. 
[02:23:30]  Joe!  Joe!  Joe!  Joe!  Joe!  Joe!  I love a mom.  Don't you just love a mom?  It's just insanity.  It's just insanity.  Oh, awesome.  All right, well, hopefully the state troopers won't be here shortly.  All right.  And we'll check back in with you.  Check in soon, man.  All right, bye-bye.  Hey, see if you can get everybody to chant, bring back action. 
[02:24:00]  Bring back action!  Mike, what's up?  What's going on, Dallas?  All right, man.  I tell you what, I've been listening to you guys since Boston.  Yeah.  When I went to school up there.  I have not heard a funnier show.  Oh, cool.  And I think that Jay's just adding that little fine.  Oh, yeah.  Without a doubt.  And Rick's doing a lot of matter today.  Hey, Jay, I just want to say, you kick ass.  Thanks, pal.  I've been watching you since Saturday Night Live, too.  And who thought Rick called him like a big dick and said, stay away forever?  Hey, Jay, I think you should kick Rick's ass anyway at Fight Club.  I think you could take him. 
[02:24:30]  You know, I think I could take him, too.  But when he had that funny look in his eye, when we brought up the idea of the fight,  I went, uh-oh.  He got that Hispanic evil eye, right?  Yeah, but he's got, like, some cancer.  It's not going to be, like, a one-two, like, William Shatner Star Trek fight.  Like, I'm going to have to, like, get in the trenches.  Like, I'm actually going to have to get hit with him.  Yeah, you might.  You will.  So I'm going to actually have to take a couple shots.  I don't think he's Mike's Mark, though.  This show really kicks ass today.  You guys are the best.  Thank you, Mike.  Hey, I'll be at Caroline in February. 
[02:25:00]  I'll be at Caroline in February.  Actually, what Jay Moore is plugging today is Jim Brewer's appearance at Rascals tonight.  Is he at Rascals?  I think so.  I'm telling everybody listening right now, when you're done with Short Hills Mall,  you've got to see Jim Brewer, one of the funniest men alive, who's mad at me right now.  Jim, if you're listening, come on.  Can't we all get along?  I'm sorry I went over my time at the Orpheum Theater in Boston.  I wish I saw that live.  Comics Come Home happening Sunday on Comedy Central. 
[02:25:30]  I went out and they had a band, and they started playing Who Do You Love to bring me out.  And I just didn't remember my first joke.  It was like 3,000 people, and they're going bananas.  So I just started singing Who Do You Love.  Awesome.  And I had never sung before in front of a crowd like, Who Do You Love, Who Do You Love.  It was in the Hank Williams Sr. version.  And then I was, here's the thing, I was supposed to go on first, and they had a problem.  Their audio didn't match, I don't understand this business.  Their audio didn't match their video.  Something was wrong in their control truck. 
[02:26:00]  Right.  But Dennis Leary's the host, and he doesn't know it.  There's no way of telling him.  So he goes, please welcome Jay Moore.  And the players, like, applaud and go crazy.  And they tell me, don't go out.  Don't go out because we can't use it.  Unless you want to go out and come back.  I go, no, no, no, no.  So then Dennis is standing there like a schmuck, like Jay Moore.  Jay Moore.  Jay, the fabulous Jay.  And then he comes back, and he goes, what the, what's going on?  Like an idiot.  And they tell him, it takes him an hour to fix the truck. 
[02:26:30]  So they're just parading out all the comics that they don't intend to put on the TV show.  So I go on, like, seventh.  And the crowd is mad.  Because it's about 40 minutes before even a comic came out.  And Dennis goes, all right, how's everybody doing?  Still in a good mood?  No!  Like, actually, in the Orpheum Theater, like the Carnegie Hall.  Yeah, that's a great place.  They're like, no, no!  And I'm like, oh, my God.  So they send out, like, five people.  And then when it came my turn, I was like, ten minutes, my ass. 
[02:27:00]  I'm going out.  And then I started cursing and just going nuts.  I was doing Al Green, Eddie Vedder.  I was doing walking.  And then Brewer had to follow me.  And I guess his first couple of jokes, they were still kind of talking and acting like idiots.  But Brewer, anybody can pull it together.  It's Brewer.  All right.  And I'm not kissing his ass.  Look at that.  We know how funny Brewer is.  Yeah, he is.  Jim, you're next on FM Talk.  What's up?  Hey, they're carrying around signs now that say,  let the homeless shop and the homeless celebrate Christmas, too. 
[02:27:30]  And they misspelled your name, Opie.  What is it?  Opie?  It's spelled Opie.  That's okay.  Two P's?  That's the common misspelling of Opie's name.  Opie.  We have a U.S. Marshal on line three.  Oh.  Rob, what's up?  Hi, yes.  I'm calling from the United States Marshal Service in New York, New Jersey.  Yeah.  And I just have to give you guys a message from me.  You guys suck.  All right.  No, I'm just, I also live in that area, and they can't close the doors on you. 
[02:28:00]  All right.  Now, they've been cool so far.  No, but on the bottom of the doors in the Short Hills Mall,  there are signs that say these doors must remain open and unlocked during business hours.  Okay.  So I'll just let you guys know they can't close any doors on you.  All right.  Thank you, Rob.  All right.  Bye.  We needed a Marshall to tell us that, I guess.  I'm hoping Christopher Walken's going to, you know.  Oh, gee.  Make the guy up.  Big Hollywood star now.  Stop by the show today.  Look.  Maybe everybody in Victoria's Secret.  My friends, they want to shop. 
[02:28:30]  Buy on the pants for them and theirs.  Look at Ziggy.  Four feet tall, laying down.  Let the man buy clashes, panties, maybe a nice flannel and some.  Look, your manager's uptight.  There's nothing you can do to stop us.  Look, we're a mask.  Opie and Anthony, 102.7 Talk Radio.  Forget it.  Why listen to music?  You own the album.  What are you going to listen to? 
[02:29:00]  Rock and roll.  You own that record.  Put it on 102.7.  Listen to the homeless.  It's a riot, baby.  It's a riot.  En masse.  A peaceful assemblage of people.  Smelly, white, black.  But they all smell.  White, black, Puerto Rican.  No Chinese.  They take care of their own.  They take care of their own.  They don't let them get homeless.  When was the last time you saw a Chinese homeless man?  Never.  They invite them in with open arms.  Not like the whites and the blacks.  They say, don't come home. 
[02:29:30]  You can go to Chinatown.  You're Chinese.  Down on your luck.  You can wash dishes.  Go to a cock fight.  You're never on the outs as a Chinaman.  It's too bad.  Unless you have red hair.  If you're 300 pounds and have red hair, then they don't like you.  Not like a 300 pound red-headed Chinese man.  It's strange, really.  Go to Short Hills Mall.  I command you.  No one will know.  No one will know. 
[02:30:00]  Opie.  Anthony.  1027.  Bravo.  Christopher Walken, everyone.  Stop and buy.  You're in your car in a 50-mile radius of Short Hills Mall.  Get there.  Oh, my God.  Rise up.  I want Opie and Anthony to be more famous than me.  All right.  Psycho Mark back on the phone.  What's up, Psycho Mark?  All right, guys.  We're just about starting to wrap things up.  We're standing outside of FAO Schwartz.  We're going to sing a Christmas carol for you guys. 
[02:30:30]  Okay.  All right.  We're going to start singing.  Okay.  We're going to sing Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.  Anybody?  Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.  What about Santa?  That's a very tiny eagle.  Oh, my God.  And if you have a time for yourself.  Somebody does the a cappella.  Take it.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo! 
[02:31:00]  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  It's funny.  It's funny.  Nice job.  Wow.  Hey Marc.  Yeah?  You can get an O.P. and Anthony chant going.  What?  O.P.  An Anthony chant?  O.P.  An Anthony!  O.P.  O.P.  An Anthony!  O.P.  Anthony!  O.P. 
[02:31:30]  Anthony!  O.P.  Anthony!  O.P.  Anthony!  Yeah.  Leave your mark.  All right, Mark, hold on.  We have a state trooper on the line.  Hold on.  Joe.  Yes.  Are you a state trooper?  Yes, I am.  All right, what's going on?  Listen, I just want to warn you guys.  I actually heard they're putting out a SWAT team.  Yeah, yeah, okay. 
[02:32:00]  I'm not kidding.  It's coming out of Troop A.  Off the Garden State Park.  Okay, sure thing.  I don't think you're joking.  I'm not kidding.  A SWAT team.  What do you mean a SWAT team?  They're not going in riots.  They're going in to take them all in.  They have two school bus-sized buses.  What law have they broken?  Yeah, what law has been broken?  I don't know.  I'm trying to figure out.  Yeah, you're a lieutenant with the state police,  and you don't know what law they've broken. 
[02:32:30]  Because there isn't any law.  You're so full of crap.  You aren't even with it.  There isn't any law being broken.  You aren't a trooper.  Where are you a trooper out of, Joe?  Yeah.  Excuse me?  Where are you a trooper out of?  Springfield.  All right.  And what barracks is that?  L.  Yeah, sure.  All right.  I believe them.  But I want to know why.  That's a lot of lawsuits.  You start arresting people for no reason.  Yeah.  That's a lot of bad press.  I mean, you got a lot of people out there chanting Opie and Anthony, and the people. 
[02:33:00]  Truthfully, guys, I'm all for it.  It's not like a Farrakhan thing where they start beating up cops and taking a drive.  Maybe they'll fart or, like, stink the place up.  But they have a right.  They're shopping, for crying out loud.  If they're in there, the only way I can see is if they're in there without a license.  A license?  It's kind of like a protest.  No, it's not.  They're in there with signs, and they're screaming and yelling.  But that's the general public.  That's not the Opie and Anthony-sponsored homeless excursion. 
[02:33:30]  The Opie and Anthony-sponsored group, they are shopping.  That is a right you have to shop.  It's a mall.  Where else are they supposed to go?  People need Christmas gifts.  These people are shopping.  People holding up signs and taking their breasts out.  We have no control over that.  Absolutely.  That has nothing to do with the Opie and Anthony program.  Guys, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.  Well, why don't you go down there?  Why don't you go down there and stand up?  I just want to call and warn you.  That's all.  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  I think you should go down there and stand up to your brethren.  You tell those troopers to bring gas masks.  Not for tear gas or anything, because Viggy really stinks. 
[02:34:00]  I know.  You got to start playing NWA.  Yeah, really.  All right.  We're being told to move by the head of the wall here.  Why?  Under what grounds?  Because we're disrupting traffic.  Traffic of what?  You are the traffic.  I know, but what am I going to do?  He's spitting his face.  Let me talk to him.  You guys are spitting, you know, some...  And they should all sit down and hold hands.  Let me see if I can find him.  Let me see if I can find him.  I don't know.  He disappeared.  He was all...  All right.  Where are you guys right now?  We are standing outside of F.A.O. Schwartz, right here in the mall, right outside of Brookstone. 
[02:34:30]  And they want us to keep moving because we're causing too much of a ruckus.  And pretty much everyone went home at this point, right?  Everyone was just chanting, spaz is gay, right?  Spaz is gay!  Spaz is gay!  Oh, my God!  This place is nuts.  All right. 
[02:35:00]  Well, how are the homeless people doing?  We haven't talked to them in a while.  They're great.  All of them have some great presents.  They've all done some...  They've got some great stuff.  Guys got shoes.  All right.  Guys got some coats.  Okay.  Other guys got some stuff for their lady friends.  Cool.  Yeah.  And it's actually turned out to be a real big success.  And, you know...  Yeah.  Hey, Mark.  Mark.  It's Jay Moore.  Listen to me very carefully.  I'm listening.  You are not breaking any laws.  We just talked to a state trooper at a Barrett's L, Springfield, New Jersey, on the phone.  They're sending a SWAT team to round you guys up into school buses, he told us. 
[02:35:30]  Jay Moore wants to talk to you on the phone.  Would you like to talk to him?  He doesn't want to talk to you, Jay.  Tell him he has to.  I have a constitutional right to know what's happening.  Jay has a constitutional right to know what's happening.  You want to talk to him real quick?  He refuses to speak to him.  He's a coward, and he knows you guys are not breaking any laws.  Maybe we should have a thousand people moon him.  All right.  Now I'm getting pushed.  I think I'm getting pushed.  Oh, no.  You're being assaulted.  Look at this.  It's just America. 
[02:36:00]  It's just Russia.  We're going back to the bus.  No, no, no.  You're not.  No, you're not.  You're just going to be very careful.  I know the law.  If he pushes you and you feel threatened, that is assault.  That man is just assaulting you.  I'm not joking.  Jay knows.  He does it to the paparazzi all the time.  That's right.  You were just.  You were not battered, but if you felt threatened, you were assaulted.  That man cannot put his hands on you for standing in the mall.  I know, but he told me to go the other way, and, you know, what am I going to do? 
[02:36:30]  All right, well, well, I got a great idea.  Opie and Anthony, we're going to call the cops on him.  There you go.  Hey, Mark, just go to another part of the mall at this point.  All right, we're heading out towards the other end of the mall right now.  Freedom to shop.  All right, call back, Mark.  We'll check back in.  All right, bye.  We are so late.  We've got to take a break.  All right, we're back.  This is FM Talk, 1027 Talk.  You can't ignore.  Opie and Anthony and Jay Moore, everyone.  Man.  Who the hell is turning off their radio today, man? 
[02:37:00]  What a day this has been, huh?  Our homeless to the mall excursions have been a huge success.  Huge.  People are pissed at us now because they can't even get in the parking lot at the Short Hills Mall.  Yeah.  We have taken over the mall, basically.  You mind checking with Rick?  Hell yeah.  All right, let's go back to the mall.  Hey, Rick.  Have a tryout of Michael Jordan.  Jordan smells good.  Snoop, Snoop, try out of that Michael Jordan stuff.  The new Michael Jordan cologne. 
[02:37:30]  They're trying on cologne at Macy's, I believe.  Rick?  Guys.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're at Macy's.  We're trying out some men's fragrances.  All right.  Snoop is checking out some Hugo Boss and some Michael Jordan.  Snoop smells like Michael Jordan after a double overtime loss.  I think the Chief is definitely buying some Hugo Boss.  And, God damn it, Ziggy's just running around.  Where'd he go?  Ziggy.  They all point over there.  He's so easy to keep track of, you know. 
[02:38:00]  And now it's the blind people.  Hey, Ziggy, come here.  Ziggy, come here, man.  How'd you do it?  Who's got it?  Awesome.  All right.  We had one of the guys here who was online that thought he wanted to buy the Chief.  Dario.  The Chief is Cologne.  Oh, very nice.  Put that guy on.  A little Christmas present.  That's nice.  Ziggy, come here, man.  How are you feeling?  You look a little tired.  You look a little worn out.  You look a little tired. 
[02:38:30]  Well, there are these marble walls.  They're pretty slippery.  Are they drinking the cologne?  As you can tell, the marble floors are slippery.  Either that or the marble doors are butted-y.  I don't know why.  It's one of the two.  And believe me, some of the Macy's people here are horrified.  Oh, I bet.  We got some flamethrower security guys talking to Joaquin.  Where's the guy that bought cologne for the Chief?  Huh?  Where's the guy that bought cologne for the Chief? 
[02:39:00]  Is he still around?  Oh, yeah.  What's your name, dude?  Dario.  Dario.  That's my brother.  Oh, okay.  Richard's his brother.  Here he is.  What's up, folks?  Owen Egg.  Hey, what's up?  Jay Moore's in the studio, too.  Good.  That's good.  My brother just bought one of your buddies, the Chief, some cologne.  He was a boy.  Thank you very much.  That's very nice.  Christmas spirit.  You're a good person.  We've got a lot of fans driving home.  Let's keep to Christ in Christmas.  Everyone working from the ledger driving home, listen to us.  Buy these people's kids.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks for helping us out today.  All right. 
[02:39:30]  No problem, guys.  Enjoy your holidays.  All right.  You, too.  You know, one of the main ingredients in cologne, Opie, is alcohol.  Once again, the white man buying the Indian alcohol to try to keep him down.  My wife, Kitty.  My wife, Kitty, drank a mouthwash.  Kitty Dukakis.  Kitty Dukakis, man.  Kitty Dukakis cologne.  It comes with a bendy straw.  A Kitty Dukakis cocktail.  Hey, Rick.  Yeah.  We're back to you.  Sorry.  What's up?  You had a CFAO Schwartz.  The women were gathering up their little white children and running for cover as we came 
[02:40:00]  into the freaking store.  I'm going to buy some toys for the Chief's kid.  All right.  You don't like them?  All right.  We're heading out now.  Wouldn't that be cute to see little Ziggy doing the thing like it big, playing the piano  thing?  You know, jumping around, playing a little tune on the piano thing.  He'll probably lay down on it and take a nap.  He could be Tom Stanks.  He was exhausted.  All right.  All right, Rick.  What's going on?  We're heading over to the fountain here. 
[02:40:30]  I think they're going to toss some change in the fountain.  Let's toss Ziggy in.  Yeah.  Toss Ziggy in.  Let him get a little bath.  Let him swim, man.  Let Ziggy take a bath.  You want to jump in, dude?  Look, Zig.  There's change in here.  Tell Ziggy you can keep it.  Somebody's going to take a bath.  Look.  Ziggy, we got quarters.  We got nickel.  Check this out, buddy.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  He's eyeballing the fountain, guys.  Here he goes.  Here he goes.  He's looking.  Get the chat going, Ziggy. 
[02:41:00]  Come on, everybody.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Yeah, get in there.  Who's the girl?  Who's that?  Melinda.  Oh, he reached out.  He reached out.  He reached out.  He grabbed the corner.  All right.  Very good.  Wow.  He's got to die, man.  What is he?  Daffy Duck?  He's a happy miser.  All right.  It's mine.  I tell you, mine.  How big is the crowd right now?  He looks like a criminal, for Christ's sake.  I think the crowd died down.  I've got a feeling. 
[02:41:30]  Has the crowd died down now, Rick?  The crowd is, well, our crowd is a little quiet, but they're following in unison.  Okay.  They're following.  We're making our way back to Houlihan's.  Houlihan's is giving us some free food as we exit the mall in about 15 minutes.  All right.  And we're going to be hitting the bus at 6 o'clock.  Oh, very good.  All right?  All right.  Check in with us in a few minutes, all right?  Guys, we'll talk to you later.  All right.  Oh, man.  They're having fun.  I'm so surprised they haven't been kicked out yet. 
[02:42:00]  I just had a great idea.  Because you've got to outdo yourself now.  But that's always our problem.  I got the next one.  All right.  Ten different homeless people.  Yeah.  $200 a pop.  Yeah.  Atlantic City.  Oh, nice.  Can you see the look on a homeless guy's face when he pisses away $200?  Or one guy just blows up and makes all of it black.  All of it on black.  Let it ride.  One guy comes home with a grand apartment in Brooklyn Heights. 
[02:42:30]  You see a homeless guy at a blackjack table losing money.  I like the idea.  Oh, man.  Rob, what's up?  Double down.  Come on.  Double down.  Hey, Rob.  How you doing?  All right.  What's going on?  Not much.  Good.  Hey.  I don't know if I'm going to say personal friend, but I have many photos with Ziggy,  whose real name is supposedly Bobby.  Okay.  Yeah.  He hangs out on Bleeker Street.  I forget which street that's between, but if you're familiar with the club life.  All right.  Yeah.  He hangs out across from there. 
[02:43:00]  It's Sullivan and McDougal.  Yeah.  Right in between there.  Right in the corner from the Boston Comedy Club.  He's a great guy.  The first time I met him, he's sleeping in front of the pizza place there in a box.  He was like sitting in the box using like a lounge chair.  But one of his favorite things, he loves chess and he likes looking at chess pieces.  So if you can get them somewhere, you can see some chess pieces,  you'll probably get a real good kick out of that.  All right.  Cool.  One more thing real quick.  Yeah.  The last rumor has it that a lot of people in that area,  even he'll say that he was the actual writer of the song, Mr. Sandman. 
[02:43:30]  So you might want to ask him about that.  All right.  We'll ask him.  I'm sure we'll get a good answer on that one.  Great show.  Hey, thank you.  Have a good one.  All right.  Bye.  Jason, you're next on FM Talk.  What's going on?  Hello.  What's up, Jason?  You're next.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I want you to know, 12 years ago, I was working down at Short Hills Mall through a temporary agency.  They see a black man come in, like 20 to 30 of us, mixed in with Latinos.  And the first thing they say is, oh, wow, it's getting dark in here. 
[02:44:00]  You know what I'm saying?  So when we're in there, the way they treat us during the whole holiday season working there,  they treat us like we're garbage.  There you go.  Yeah, and they were looking down at homeless people going around in the air truck just asking  for something, you know, spare change, food, something to eat.  And they would turn their backs on you like you was the worst piece of crap in the world.  But you were there working, though, right?  Yeah, I was working through a temporary agency.  And this was like, uh...  So you were there making a living.  Yeah, but even though I was making a living, you still was treated like you was garbage.  Nice.  Yeah, like you were garbage.  Because the idea was just a race thing also, as well. 
[02:44:30]  They just saw you as a black person, and they treated you like you was garbage.  You know what?  When you work there, just don't pay your taxes.  They don't like you so much.  You're such garbage.  You don't have to pay garbage taxes.  Yeah.  You know what you guys should do to get even?  You should have them all break wind at once.  Break wind?  Yeah, all at once.  They don't need a break wind.  Trust me.  They stink anyway.  Yeah, but a sword.  That'll teach them all in the sword.  I have to deal with it.  All right, Jason, I've got to cut you off.  Psycho Mark's back on the line.  All right, you guys are best.  All right, thank you.  Pat from Oakdale with an instant feedback real quick.  Jay is cracking me up.  Anyone on the phone?  Bitches.  Anyone want to talk to him? 
[02:45:00]  Rick, there's a cop here and Jay.  Let me talk to him.  Mark, there's a trooper here and Jay.  Let me talk to him.  Rick, Christ is here and he'd like to say Jay.  Let me talk to him.  That's right.  Where's Yahweh?  Put Yahweh on.  I've been waiting 2,000 years to talk to the guy.  Psycho Mark, what's going on?  They just moved the bus on us.  A bunch of troopers and cops just pulled up and they told the bus to move.  So the bus just drove off and we're all standing here.  You're going to be homeless.  Hey, I read something in instant feedback.  The guy said he was listening to the scanner and they said that they were going to make 
[02:45:30]  the bus move because it was in a fire lane.  Yeah.  Yep.  Oops.  They just did that.  The bus just disappeared and we have no idea where it went.  So what are you, outside the mall right now?  Yeah, we're outside the mall.  There's got to be about 30 or 40 people just out here.  Rick's still inside with Ben and they're working their way out.  And as a matter of fact, a bunch of people here have bought some stuff and some gifts just  for the homeless people.  One guy bought a jacket for Ziggy.  Oh, very cool.  Oh, yeah.  So there's some nice, you know, some nice feelings here before Christmas and people 
[02:46:00]  are very nice, you know, except for the police.  All right.  Well, let us know when you find the bus, okay?  Yeah, that'd be a great thing.  I'd like to come back to the city.  Okay.  All right, man.  See you guys.  Bye.  How could that be your undoing?  A celebration like that and someone parks the bus in a freaking fireland.  And when we got there, there was plenty of parking.  Eric, what's up?  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  What's going on?  I'm outside the mall.  It's crazy, man.  I'm trying to get in here.  Yeah.  There is people all over the place and everybody seems to be listening to you because everybody 
[02:46:30]  is dying in their car trying to get in here.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  It is crazy.  Right on.  Do you know what exit they're going to be at?  I don't know.  I don't know what's happening now.  Jeez.  Just keep listening to the radio.  Oh, my God.  It is hilarious.  You guys rule, man.  I've been listening to the show all day.  It's the best show you've ever done.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  My phone sex with Marco just got blown past.  I know.  Look at it.  A rocket ship.  Sounds like McGuire passing Maris.  Boom.  God.  Roger Hood.  They got a Bruno Mali store over there. 
[02:47:00]  Someone said tell them to go to Bruno Mali and try on the shoes just like OJ.  Hey, Rick.  Yo.  What's up?  What's happening, guys?  I have bad news for you.  The bus has been moved.  They can't find it.  They can't find it?  No.  Yeah, it was in a fire lane.  Oh, jeez.  They better not have.  The bus driver is listening.  He knows to go back.  Oh, look at this.  We're at Bloomingdale.  Yeah.  We're at Bloomingdale.  And the fine people at Bloomingdale have already packed bags for our group.  Oh, very nice.  T-shirts, hats, and cookies. 
[02:47:30]  Really?  We have Nora, the general manager.  Yep.  And the entire staff here at Bloomingdale.  Come on up, guys.  Come get your stuff.  That's fantastic.  It's like Halloween and Christmas at the same time.  I think they're just paying them off.  Give it to them at the door.  And then it's like, okay, move on.  Move along.  You don't have to come in.  You don't have to come in.  You're smart.  How about we do a little jingle bells for the people at Bloomingdale. 
[02:48:00]  You guys ready?  Ready?  One, two, three.  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.  Oh, my body's too bright.  Oh, my heart's open sleigh.  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.  Oh, my body's too bright.  Oh, my heart's open sleigh.  There's one chick there.  She's got to shut up.  Hey, Rick.  Yeah.  Park Avenue Chiropractic.  They're somewhere in the mall. 
[02:48:30]  They want to give some of the homeless guys, like, free massages.  All right.  We'll try and find them.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  I swear to God.  They sent us a fax.  We are offering the bums free massages and spinal adjustment at our office.  All right.  We're heading there now.  We'll talk to you guys later.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  This is the funniest radio I've ever heard.  Hey, Chuck.  Yo, what's up, man?  Chuck was supposed to be on the trip with the guys, but his wife wouldn't let him go.  I'm so pissed, man.  Your show has changed my life.  Yeah? 
[02:49:00]  For the first time, I have realized that I'm really married.  Yeah, and not only that, I'm definitely pussy with that.  Yeah?  My wife wouldn't let me go.  I can't believe I'm uttering these words.  My wife would not let me go.  We had to go buy a Christmas tree instead.  Divorce the bitch.  Hey.  You're out, man.  Hey, hey, hey, Jay.  You got Marco's number?  I knew I should have gone gay.  I'm telling you right now.  You should have, man.  You don't know what you're missing.  What's that?  You don't know.  I mean nothing.  You know, the funny thing is, I'm Jewish. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, yeah.  I'm Jewish guy.  Yeah, hey, yeah.  Very nice.  Now I've got a dead goyim tree in my living room.  How hilarious is it, man?  Oh, my God.  This is great, man.  You know what?  The second thing is, you know, I tell her, look, let's go.  We can go together.  Right.  And she's like, well, where are they?  I'm like the Short Hills Mall.  She's like, you know damn well we can't afford to shop at the Short Hills Mall.  So here's my life.  I'm pussy whipped and homeless guys shop at better retail outlets than I do. 
[02:50:00]  There you go.  Chuck, with that, I've got to let you go.  The guys are checking in again.  All right, guys.  All right, man.  Later.  Rick, what's going on?  Guys, we have Santa Claus from the North Pole.  We're here, guys.  You're with Santa?  Okay.  How are you doing, pal?  Hey, Santa.  Yes.  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas to you, Santa.  Hey, are you taking pictures with the homeless guys?  We're having a ball here.  We've got a whole gang here.  It's great. 
[02:50:30]  You're going to be taking pictures with some of our homeless friends?  We'd like to take some pictures if we can, you know.  It's possible.  I think it'd be great.  We're going to take some pictures.  Okay.  I've been drinking Ziggy's cologne.  This is a great treat for all these guys.  A great treat.  Jesus, man.  Hey, get some pictures.  We're going to take some pictures of Santa and the guys, and then we'll head back over  to who has.  I cannot wait to see these pictures, man.  I've got to see them.  The chief is running for Santa.  Oh, cool.  Rick, I'm going to check in with Ben, and I'm going right back to you. 
[02:51:00]  Stay right there, all right?  All right.  You got it, Ben.  And to me, good white scalp.  All right, Ben's at another part of the mall.  Ben, what's going on?  Hey, Ben.  Uh-oh, his phone's trapping.  Sounds better now.  We're at Huland.  The lovely staff of Huland has provided us with nice chicken wings as we get ready to  exit the mall there.  There you go.  My God, that's insulting.  He's going to keep the bones and make a hat.  They moved the bus. 
[02:51:30]  They're trying to get us out.  They're trying to kick us out of the mall.  Yeah.  They made us move the bus, but we don't know where the bus is, so we're getting ready to  exit.  All right.  You can't tell the cops you can't exit if you don't have a ride home.  Right.  You don't want the homeless people catching a cold.  Very true.  What is it with homeless people in their immune system?  They sleep on the sidewalk with their underpants.  If I don't get eight hours of sleep, I get a sore throat. 
[02:52:00]  These guys are like living, they sleep on a rock in their underpants wearing an eyepatch  and a diaper.  Snowing out.  These guys got ripped muscles.  I'm going to be homeless.  All right.  All right, Ben.  Thanks.  We all got old ladies.  We're buying gifts for their old ladies.  How's the homeless guy?  Hey, how do you like my dumpster?  Yeah, exactly.  They're buying little gifts for their ladies.  You want to go back to my bag?  You're brutal, man.  But it's so freaking true, man. 
[02:52:30]  It's like Atlantic City, homeless.  You got to be real quiet if you hit the casino.  That's a great idea.  They'll break some arms.  All right, Rick, what's up?  Rick.  Hey, Rick.  All right.  Hey, Rick.  Who's that?  Where's soup?  Oh, they're getting on Santa's lap.  Oh.  Chief, you're up.  Chief's getting on Santa's lap.  Chief.  Actually, his name's Gray Wolf.  Yeah, Gray Wolf.  Gray Wolf.  I bet the copoon had handcuffed him, boy.  Right.  He would have had some, like, okey-fun-okey move on.  Hey, Rick. 
[02:53:00]  Hey, guys, you ready?  One, two, three.  Ah!  What did they say?  They're smiling.  Oh.  I think that was a homeless version of cheese.  Ah!  Take it.  Come here.  Take it.  I believe they're getting a group picture, Anthony.  Yeah.  So they can cherish this day at the Short Hills Mall.  I just picture a guy laying underneath a pile of papers, winter wind blowing, with a little  Polaroid picture of him and Santa, flopping in the cold breeze.  That's the outro.  All right, everybody. 
[02:53:30]  Remembering his little thing.  The same thing is, these guys are going to go back.  Huh?  I'm going to take a picture.  Oh, okay.  The same thing is, these guys, like, after this day of luxury, they've got to go back to,  like, the stoop.  A homeless, yeah.  Man, I remember one day I went shopping.  That was the best day of my life.  You should have seen me.  Michael Jordan Cologne.  Nike sneakers.  No one's going to believe them.  Who the hand chicken wings.  Man, I was living high in the heart. 
[02:54:00]  Them with the dames.  I love Mr. Sandman.  Hello?  Yeah, Rick, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  The white man stole it from me.  All right.  We just got Snoop, Ziggy, the Chief, and Keith to get pictures with Santa Claus.  Oh, bravo.  Hey, Rick, some guy called and said that Ziggy is actually Jackie Wilson.  Well, that was a rumor, but I don't know if that's true.  Right.  We saw it with Mickey Rooney for a second.  Mickey Rooney and Bill.  No, he's in Australia. 
[02:54:30]  Wow, he does look like Mickey Rooney from Bill.  I look like Bill.  I got good teeth and regular good hair.  Bill.  Then he started kicking me in the car.  I have a Bill coffee shop now.  He's kicking me in the car.  I don't want to go back to that place no more.  I got Nick kicking me in the car.  In the car.  Oh, boy, chicken.  Oh, boy.  Hey, Rick.  You're all there.  All right, Rick.  We're going to let you go.  Check in.  We've got to take a quick break, all right? 
[02:55:00]  All right, guys.  All right.  You know what the funniest part of that movie was when he was trying to call Barry, his friend,  and the operator's asking him for a number, and he kept giving too many numbers?  I need Barry more.  Three, five, oh, seven, two, five.  Why do you have to be more?  Six, oh, seven, thirty-five, eighteen, nine.  He got confused with his lotto numbers.  I think he looks like Mickey Rooney.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, he does.  He's like a little fat white guy.  A little weeble.  A weeble. 
[02:55:30]  But he does fall down.  I'm actually going to roll out of here, you guys.  Really?  Yeah.  Because I had, like, three things to do, and then I blew them all off for the opium.  You know what I can't imagine?  I can't imagine that there's human beings in the Tri-State area listening to something  else right now.  What are you going to do?  Like, that boggles the mind.  There's a 92-minute rock block you can listen to.  Good.  The meaty, cheesy boys are on right now on a station that ends in hundreds.  All right.  If you're leaving, what do you want to plug? 
[02:56:00]  Aren't you playing a reindeer or something tonight on TV?  I want it known for the record.  I came here to plug nothing.  I know that.  There's a friend of the show, and one of the emails said,  why doesn't Jay plug all of the other reindeer?  It's a Christmas special where Drew Barrymore produced it,  and she plays the reindeer, and I play her owner.  It's a really, it's really sweet.  It's a cartoon.  It's really funny.  Mac Reining.  Okay.  From the Simpsonsville submitted.  But let's not plug.  Everyone's going to watch it anyway, because it's Christmas Carol,  and it's Drew Barrymore.  And more importantly, let's just, let's give it up for Opie and Anthony 
[02:56:30]  helping the homeless.  Yes, thank you, Jay.  And Jay, you're welcome any time.  Don't let this little mix-up with Rick earlier have any...  Look how much fun we had.  And Rick goes, today's not good.  You know why?  Because today was like Rick's day in the sun.  Right.  And he did a good job.  He doesn't want any Jay Moore, Mr. Hollywood, effing it up.  He doesn't want to get blown up by the security guard,  and then the security guard talked to me.  I like the fat girl.  The candy store's like, no, you wouldn't like this.  Yes, she knew. 
[02:57:00]  Right and off.  I'm like, I'll get in there.  She's like, oh, no, you wouldn't.  I'm ugly.  Man, I could haunt a house.  Let me lift up my gut, see what you can do.  That's beautiful.  All right.  Sorry Marco didn't call.  Well, next time, Jay.  Next time.  I love you guys.  You're welcome any time.  I have my number now, so I might have to get you guys.  I'm going to get you guys planted in the West Coast.  I'm going to start doing some remotes maybe for you.  Hey, we go out to L.A. sometime to hang out or something. 
[02:57:30]  We've got to hook up.  You can do it from my house.  He'll forget all about us.  We'll be knocking at his door.  That's what you said last time.  Hey, Jay.  Across from me, my friend.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  You got me.  You got me.  Luke was in his house saying, I can't come up.  I got a doctor's department.  Here you are.  Bingo, here I am.  Right.  I could have went and gotten Klonopin and Valium.  I would have gotten all my happy pills, all my airplane pills.  Oh, you hate to fly?  No, I love to fly.  I love to get loaded more.  We're about to crash into Ohio. 
[02:58:00]  Who cares?  I'm high.  Who cares?  So you're flying to L.A. tomorrow?  I'm flying to L.A. actually Saturday.  I just had that to make you a shielded.  Oh, okay.  You're welcome tomorrow, too.  You're welcome.  Tomorrow we have a 73-year-old stripper getting naked.  Kids.  And Luba, the Russian chick.  Can I take her in the suite?  Yeah, you can.  Grab those udders.  If you could make that happen.  The udders.  The peanut bread.  If you could make that happen, man, you'll be a god. 
[02:58:30]  What?  If a 73-year-old?  If I was.  You were surprised that I got the cousin to kiss.  I heard Brewer took flack.  Some guy called up and said, hey, Jay Moore was on.  He got cousins, man.  We were trying to get Luba to get her top off.  The Russian model, you know, topless.  And we said, hey, man, if Jay was here, it would have happened to her.  Is she going to be here tomorrow?  Maybe that's why Brewer is best.  She wants to be a lesbian.  I can't get chicks naked like Jay.  She wants to be a lesbian for a day, so if you tune in the show, you think.  I'll come in dressed up like Liza Minnelli.  There you go.  If you think the show's happening tomorrow, come on in and check out the festivities.  What time do you guys start? 
[02:59:00]  Two?  Well, that's what, yeah, sort of.  Supposed to.  We don't really get on the air until three.  All right, I'll come by maybe.  I'm going to take a nap tomorrow.  We do like dressed up from 2 to 2.40 so we can play like video games and watch.  Yeah, we're in the office playing games.  We run the, you know, SNL and stuff.  We listen to tapes of our show going out over the air going like, hey, this is great.  I'll be up.  I will come up after my nap.  Okay.  More than welcome.  Maybe I'll get an, you know, I got some money.  I got some shekels put away.  Maybe I'll get an escort agency and get some real lesbians up here to do it. 
[02:59:30]  There you go.  Come on.  It's a write-off.  There you go.  All right.  Let me just mention Show World now.  You're going to find people.  Yeah, because now I can write it off.  I'm doing a joke about it on the air because we all have Show World's funny, right?  Yeah.  So I can write off my $2.25.  God damn.  Picky token.  It's not so bad when you're masturbating in a booth.  It's when that guy comes in with a mop under your feet. 
[03:00:00]  You write about the mercury's rising, the baby batter's about to spill, and the mop hits  you in the feet.  You're like, that's what I needed.  I always grab the guy and make him sit in the stall with me.  Hey, give me a check that out.  Now you've got to watch this little map of Hawaii.  Hey, we put a map of Hawaii on our blow-up dial in our office just for you.  Did you get Kauai, the little island?  Yes, we did.  If you forget Kauai, it comes out later when you pee. 
[03:00:30]  All right.  Gentlemen, I love you.  Jay, anytime.  New York City, Connecticut, I love you.  Anybody listen to O.P. and Anthony?  There's nothing better.  Spread the word.  All right.  Spread the word.  O.P. and Anthony.  It's a revolution.  You can't get over.  O.P. and Anthony.  I got to go.  All right.  We'll see you tomorrow.  I love you.  Follow Pete D'Aletti.  He'll be back tomorrow.  Look, he wants to leave, but he just can't leave.  Jay Moore, everyone.  Jay Moore. 
[03:01:00]  He's going to come to see you tomorrow, and then it's going to be right.  All right.  Jay's going to come back tomorrow, possibly, and he'll be back in February.  Our only Hollywood friend, Anthony.  Well, if you only have to have one, he's the guy.  Man, he's got me laughing my ass off today.  God damn.  Woo!  All right.  Let's check in with Rick at Short Hills Mall.  Rick!  Guys!  What's going on?  Yeah!  Wow. 
[03:01:30]  Holy jeez.  All right.  Hand them in.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!  I think you can tell, it's going to be a successful topic.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!  I can't hear a damn thing.  Wow.  We got a couple hundred people out here who are just coming out to greet the bus and wish  us well at our back home.  Guys, thanks for hanging out with us today. 
[03:02:00]  And Sue's doggy dog just threw his shirt out to the crowd.  Wow.  All right, guys.  We're on the bus and we are heading out of here.  And, uh...  Oh, there they go, huh?  They're back on the bus.  It's like the Beatles, Anthony.  Yes.  It's like the Beatles, everyone.  The Beatles landed at, uh...  Kennedy Airport.  That's right. 
[03:02:30]  Holy crap.  All right.  We're ready to roll.  All right.  We're ready to roll.  Let's roll.  They're all on the bus?  Yeah, they're on the bus.  Everyone counted?  Did you do a head count?  We're actually...  We actually have plucked one on the bus.  Wait, you picked one up?  Well, the chief picked up a girlfriend.  Oh, my God.  She's wowing the crowd.  Come on.  We're not supposed to bring more homeless back to New York. 
[03:03:00]  That defeats the purpose.  That defeats the purpose.  Oh, the mayhem.  Let me get this straight.  We were hoping that a few of the homeless guys would stay in Jersey, thus helping the New York homeless problem.  Right, but it turns out we're bringing one back with us.  Yeah, basically, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  I hope she's going to do it again.  All right.  Let's see this.  Oh, my goodness.  How do they look, Rick? 
[03:03:30]  Those are some huge cans.  Are they?  Wow.  He's going to be able to get a buck for each one of those cans.  What are they cheering outside the bus?  Hey, Rick.  What?  Are they cheering outside the bus?  They're cheering outside.  She's in the bus, pressing her breath against the window.  That's hilarious.  Don't go home.  There's something about the hole.  Oh.  Go home.  Oh, show the hole. 
[03:04:00]  Go home.  Go home.  Go home.  Go home.  Go home.  Go home.  Go home.  Go home.  Go home.  Come on.  Go home, baby.  Go home.  Show the hole.  Oh, my God.  What's that?  All right, guys.  We're out of here.  All right.  Wow.  All right.  Uh-oh.  What?  They're starting to rock the bus a little bit.  Oh, great.  Look at Rick. 
[03:04:30]  Okay, let's roll.  Don't hit that thing right over, man.  Oh, wow.  The security people are pissed off.  You hear that?  Yeah.  They're banging on the bus.  Oh.  All right.  Are you out of harm's way?  Not really.  Hold on.  Okay, yeah.  Now we're out of harm's way.  All right.  Very good.  We're getting a police escort back to the highway.  All right.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  What a...  You know, you thought Christmas shopping was easy, huh? 
[03:05:00]  Oh, now we're ecstatic.  A lot of work to it.  All right, Rick.  Why don't you take a breather and calls back?  You got it, fellas.  In a few minutes.  I mean, you know, like in like five minutes.  We're not taking a break.  We'll wait for a while.  All right.  Bye.  Just so Ant and I can talk a little bit here.  Wow, Anthony.  That's something.  A very successful day with the homeless people at Short Hills Mall.  People did a little shopping.  I want to know who this woman is that they picked up and bring him back to New York with.  I don't know.  I guess we'll find out on the bus when they can talk.  The chief found a girlfriend? 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  Look at this.  What does that say for a guy that can't find a chick out there?  You know, these guys are calling, I can't get any girl but a chick.  Here's a homeless guy.  Our own black girl.  He can't get a girl.  Sure.  Here's a homeless guy on a two-hour little excursion into Jersey.  He finds a chick.  She's flashing her boobs.  She's on the bus with him.  He's a homeless guy.  Amazing.  He pulls out that.  You know, you got to say you're an Indian.  And then you got to get one of those little flute things like he was doing. 
[03:06:00]  And learn how to work that.  Work the engine angle.  The black thing ain't working for you, Earl.  Work the engine angle.  You got some engine in you, right?  The chief had no problem.  Just like that.  No.  We'll talk to her when Rick calls back.  Oh, yeah.  All right?  But, you know, I got to say it.  Got to thank the fine people at Short Hills Mall.  How about that?  They were actually very cool to our homeless people.  And we didn't tell them anything.  We didn't set anything up with them.  They didn't know we were going there. 
[03:06:30]  They should be flattered that we picked them as the most exclusive mall in Jersey.  Yeah.  How about that?  So we want to thank those fine people for helping us out today.  And I also want to thank the security, the Jersey cops, and the state troopers.  Everyone treated us very nicely today.  Yeah.  Pretty cool.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Unbelievable.  Next time we do some kind of thing like this, we have to go, though.  Well, we want.  We're getting some heat from people saying, why weren't you guys on the bus?  Why didn't you go to the mall? 
[03:07:00]  We didn't have any facilities to broadcast from.  Right.  We needed to.  Yeah, exactly.  Because you can't do a whole talk show from a, you know, cell phone.  Cordless phones, especially.  Yeah.  It just wouldn't work.  Wow.  What's your name?  Hello?  What's your name?  Galaxia.  Galaxia.  What's going on?  Galaxia.  No, I just wanted to call out so you guys did a great thing today.  Oh, thanks.  And the funniest thing, though, is that I, I transferred from, I come home from work.  I live in Queens, from Manhattan. 
[03:07:30]  And I travel on the 7th train.  So I'm listening to my walkman and I'm just laughing my head off when Jay, I don't know  who it was that the security was pushing off.  Yeah.  And Jay was just like, you could sue them.  You could sue them.  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm just laughing my head off.  Oh, cool.  And people are looking at me like I'm nuts.  So you had a lot of fun listening today.  Yeah, you guys were great.  I'm even at work.  I was at work cracking up.  Me and my cousin were just laughing our heads off.  It was great.  You guys did such a great thing today.  Oh, thank you.  And also, you guys said that Comedy Central wanted to get a tape of you guys. 
[03:08:00]  Well, a lot of news agencies are very interested in what we did today.  So we'll see what happens.  You got to let us know.  Oh, we will.  We definitely will.  Oh, good.  Great thing to do anyway.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Take care.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Kevin, you're next on FM Talk.  What's going on?  Hey, what's up?  I just want to tell you guys something really funny happened.  It was kind of chaotic.  A little while ago, a guy called up and he said, you know, his wife let him go to this  thing at a by a Christmas tree.  And Jay Moore said, divorce the bitch.  Yeah.  Well, at that very second, myself, my mom, my sister, and my brother are all eating dinner. 
[03:08:30]  My brother starts choking on some freaking meatloaf.  And I'm like, me, my mom, and my sister are cracking up.  Next thing you know, we hear, ah, ah, ah.  And I looked up across the table.  My brother is like turning blue.  So I run over.  I get him up out of his chair and freaking get behind him and do the highlock maneuver.  And this freaking chugging meatloaf the size of a freaking half dollar came out of  his throat and freaking shot about, I don't know, four or five feet across the table.  We knocked a freaking little pitcher of milk over. 
[03:09:00]  Hot seat.  The freaking cats are running around licking all the milk up now.  They got a little treat.  Oh, my God.  It was just insane.  You know, we don't want any of our listeners dying over our radio show.  Oh, believe me.  I don't want my brother dying either.  But, man, he just came out from work.  You know, he's trying to eat some food.  He's going out tonight.  Oh, man, it was just hysterical.  Oh, very cool.  You guys did a real good thing today, man.  Hey, Jay Moore, are you going to leave?  He ran out, but I think he's going to be back tomorrow knowing him.  That's cool.  I saw him a couple of times when I was in college up in Delhi, New York.  It's like three hours out of the city.  Yeah.  He did like, I guess, a lip sync or lip service thing or something like that when he was on MTV. 
[03:09:30]  It was pretty cool.  Oh, I remember that.  Yeah, it was like 91, 92.  Yeah, that goes back a while.  Yeah, you guys are doing real good.  So I'll keep it up.  Thank you, Kevin.  You guys want to come to the Palisades Mall in West Nyack?  We're going to have to rest this bit for a while.  All right, because I'll tell you what, I'm a security guard there, and I'm looking to get laid off.  So if you guys want a guided tour or just go across the mayhem, I can be the guy for you.  All right, Kevin.  Thank you.  Hey, man.  Take care.  If you're on hold, you've got to make it quick because so many people want to say something real fast here.  All right? 
[03:10:00]  Tim, what's going on?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  I just came out of Garden State, Jersey Gardens, whatever the hell that is, mall.  I skipped Short Hills today because of the thing because I've never been able to get in there.  But what happened?  Like, did this come off as like a practical joke?  Are you guys going to be on the news for like a good Samaritan and all this crap?  I don't know.  Who cares?  Who knows if they'll even cover it?  I thought it was going to be crazy.  The cops are going to come arresting people.  Well, there's no laws were broken.  No, that's great.  It was pretty insane when you got... 
[03:10:30]  I'm expecting to hear all this funny stuff and it's just like, oh, you guys are going to be on the news?  And this is so sweet.  And these guys are so...  It just seems funny to me.  That doesn't seem like how you wanted to pull it off or anything.  Oh, no.  It worked out perfectly.  I think 300 people following around the homeless through the mall as they tried on suits and perfume.  I thought it was pretty funny.  All right?  Well, I guess it's just because I came out the end of it.  I just wanted to hear some of the funny stuff.  Oh, you missed...  Trust me.  There was a ton of funny stuff, Tim.  A little recap we need. 
[03:11:00]  No, that's okay.  You got to listen longer to the show.  All right.  Bye.  See you, guys.  There's always someone trying to like rain on our parade, Anthony.  Hello.  Theo, what's up?  Hey.  Yeah, I'm a mortician.  I was listening at my job on your guys.  Now, your guys is great, man.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, listen.  I heard you have left me for a day.  When are you going to have a bag for a day?  I don't know if that'll ever happen.  All right?  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  If we can take that.  No.  Matt, what's going on? 
[03:11:30]  You guys have caused total mayhem in Jersey today.  What's the matter?  Do you realize...  I go to Seton Hall, and it's usually like a 25-minute drive up to Short Hills Mall.  I could have had a class at a quarter to five.  I'm still in traffic.  Sorry, man.  I couldn't even get up there to see any of this.  This sucks.  You guys suck, man.  Sorry, man.  We got a ton of footage of this, so...  All right.  You guys didn't put it on the website?  Hell yeah.  Hell yeah.  All right.  Cool.  All right, man.  You guys roll, man.  Thank you. 
[03:12:00]  Dan, what's going on?  You're next on FM Talk.  Hey, guys.  I'll tell you.  I just came from the Short Hills Mall.  Unbelievable.  You had fun?  You guys are...  Oh, man.  The chick you guys picked up.  She wowed everybody.  Yeah.  Oh.  What does she look like?  She's hot.  Big cans.  And she left on the bus?  Yeah.  I'm stunned by this, man.  I am amazed.  I don't know who she was, but everybody started screaming, wow, and she did it.  Oh, wow.  They were huge.  All right. 
[03:12:30]  You guys, I'll tell you.  You guys are on the money.  All right.  Thank you.  Who's it, Dopey?  And Anthony.  Hey.  Anthony?  Hey.  Oh, man.  All right.  Great show today.  Great.  All right.  Thank you, Dan.  All right.  Who knows, Ziggy could be getting a Hummer in the back of the bus as we speak.  That would be hilarious.  Mr. Sullivan.  Yes.  Is this the two idiots?  Yeah.  You want to sue us?  Yes.  I would just like to inform both of you gentlemen that there will be a lawyer talking to your management  team.  Because I have been not only embarrassed, but harassed. 
[03:13:00]  Really?  Do you understand this?  No.  And don't even, don't even not even go close by saying thank you to the Short Hill Malls.  Because, let me tell you something.  This has been a disgrace.  You have your malls over there in the city.  Don't you got ghetto malls over here in Newark?  Don't be coming to our malls and doing something like that.  Yeah.  You hear me?  Yeah.  What else?  What else?  Yeah.  Okay.  I mean, what's that a thing? 
[03:13:30]  Hello, sir.  Sir?  Mr. Sullivan?  The sorriest thing is, right before it hit him, he goes, what's that, a train? 
[03:14:00]  Sir?  Did you hear that, Joey?  I heard it.  He goes, what?  I heard it.  What's that, a train?  What's that, a train?  Wham!  Damn, that's funny.  That's brilliant.  Ryan, what's going on?  What's up, bro?  I'm on the way back from work.  I sent you to you guys short hills all tied up.  It's ridiculous.  Oh, cool.  You got to see it, bro.  It's tied up all the way back from Parsippany.  It's ridiculous.  Oh, right on, man.  I just want to tell you, you guys caused a major commotion.  Oh, cool. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  Uh-oh, there goes his phone.  Break it up.  Thank you, though.  Break it up.  The guy on instant feedback.  Mike just typed in, what's that, a train?  You hear that guy say that right before he got slammed.  It's the funniest damn thing.  Hey, Bill, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  All right.  Excellent job today.  Let me tell you, it's the funniest show, as I've ever heard.  Oh, cool.  Thank you.  You made my girlfriend's day.  She's sick home.  She's sitting laying in bed listening to you the whole time. 
[03:15:00]  Tell her to give you a hummer.  She's too sick, man.  I appreciate it, Bill.  She keeps running to the bedroom.  That won't work.  All right.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  Excellent show, guys.  Thank you.  Take care.  Bye.  Joe Lyons from Comedy Central checking in.  Joey, what's up?  What's up, dude?  All right.  Huge props out to you guys.  That just kicked ass today.  That was fun today, huh?  It was.  You guys have had the best radio this week.  You just kicked butt all the way.  Oh, thanks.  Are you on the train? 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  Cool.  You're the loud guy on the cell phone.  Enjoying myself big time.  I didn't do any work this afternoon.  It was hilarious, man.  It was so good.  I hope you guys just blow off like it and just keep this thing going until like 10.  I don't know.  We started at two today.  We're a little tired.  Oh, my God.  Got to get to the office.  Right.  You got a week and a half off coming up.  Well, if someone could get Ant and I a beer, I think we could do another hour.  There you go.  All right, Joe.  Great, great.  Big props out to you and to Rick for just kicking butt.  It was awesome. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, cool.  Thanks, bro.  Have a good one, guys.  Lunch is on you tomorrow.  Okay.  Always.  All right, man.  Joe Lyons from Comedy Central.  Oh, I should ask him about the comics come home that Jay Moore is going to be doing and  Jim Brewer.  Oh, yeah.  Both guests on the show this week.  I think it's Sunday.  Sunday?  Yeah.  Got to catch that.  Risa.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  What's up?  I got to tell you, I came home from work sick today.  Wanted to go home and go to sleep.  I have been up listening to you laughing my butt off.  This was by far the best show. 
[03:16:30]  Look at that.  The accolades coming in.  You guys are the best.  I mean, if your ratings don't go up right now, you guys did a great thing.  You guys rule.  You're the best.  Can I tell everyone something?  What?  It proves that we really don't even care about ratings because the ratings book ended yesterday.  Yes.  Really?  That was, I mean, it was great with you guys.  So we didn't even do this for like, you know how to do it on TV for sweeps week or something?  Uh-huh.  If we were smart, we would have done it yesterday or Tuesday.  But we don't care.  I wish you guys would come out to Long Island and do this. 
[03:17:00]  We'll be back out to the island doing something real soon.  We definitely have to hook something up.  You guys are the best.  I wish you the best of luck and keep up the great work.  Thanks.  Actually, we're trying to throw one last party next Tuesday before we go on vacation for a week and a half.  Where at?  We don't know yet.  We're going to try to get it together.  It might be tough because the marketing department worked their asses off on this one today.  You guys got to let me know.  Well, just keep listening to the radio.  Of course.  It'll be a last minute thing if we do it.  Keep me in line, guys.  All right, Risa.  Keep up the great work.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Bye-bye. 
[03:17:30]  What is that?  A train?  That's like everyone's commenting on it on the instant feedback.  They're just laughing their asses off.  That could be the quote of the week.  Diana.  I got to hear that back one of these days.  Yeah, without a doubt.  I just left the mall.  And the funniest thing was not even so much watching the homeless guys,  but watching the chicks in Neiman Marcus, Sacks, and Nacy's putting their perfumes up  and lining up their pocketbooks.  And they're like, oh, my Lord, what's going on?  So I just came from work, and I'm dressed kind of nice, so I'm kind of passing myself off. 
[03:18:00]  I'm like, I don't know.  It's this radio show, and they're having these homeless people.  Well, this is a disgrace.  This is a disgrace to my mall.  I am so scared to walk outside right now.  You have no idea.  The chick was freaking out on me.  It was definitely the best you guys have ever done.  It was a great thing.  This other chick's hanging out outside, and it's me, one other girl,  and then this chick who comes out to smoke a cigarette.  Yeah.  And she's like, this is a disgrace.  I can't believe you bring these homeless people here.  And all these guys started turning around and screaming at her.  Yeah. 
[03:18:30]  She's like, that's right.  It's pathetic.  This chick from Jersey.  That's true.  The attitude's on there.  Oh.  And I said, when we were inside Macy's, and the girl's like, this is a disgrace.  I'm like, yeah, they thought they'd come to the most obnoxious mall in the world.  She's like, and they thought that was Short Hills.  I'm like, wouldn't you?  She was so pissed at me.  But it was a great job, guys.  All right.  Well, thank you, Diana.  Thanks.  Take care.  All right.  We've got to check in with Rick.  He's back on the bus, heading back to New York.  Rick?  Guy.  What's up?  Was that a train? 
[03:19:00]  Did you hear that?  Was that the best one ever?  Dude, that guy doesn't even know where Short Hills Mall is.  Did you listen to his accent?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  But we have our new bus rider.  What's your name again, Miss?  Virginia.  All right.  What?  Who the chief, I guess, threw some love potion number nine and pooped up.  Now, what is she doing?  Is she coming to New York with the chief?  She's coming to New York.  She's taking her clothes off on the bus to show everybody her stuff. 
[03:19:30]  Has she gotten completely naked?  Not yet.  Hey, Rick.  What's your deal?  What's your deal?  My deal?  Hello?  Hi.  Hey.  Who's this?  This is Virginia.  Hi, Virginia.  Why did you decide to get on the homeless bus back to New York?  Because I was homeless once upon a time and I totally support what you guys are doing.  Do you live in New Jersey?  I live in New Jersey, yeah.  I was homeless since age 13 up until 18.  So now, how old are you now?  I'm 21.  And what are you going to do once you get to New York? 
[03:20:00]  Whatever pops up.  I've been going with the flow all day.  Well, if you sleep outside 57th and 7th tonight, you can come by and check out our radio show live tomorrow.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  But I have to sleep outside.  Wow.  Well, you don't have any accommodations.  I don't think my girlfriend would appreciate it if I brought you home with me, so.  Funny, funny, funny.  Ah, yeah.  So, yeah, I'm having an awesome time. 
[03:20:30]  Awesome time.  All right, cool.  Are you going to...  And I am not giving blow drums.  You're not giving...  I'm a good girl, darling.  I'm a good girl.  I'm not giving oral favors.  You know, Ziggy.  Yeah, we had to dump out of that.  Do you want to, like, flash the guys one last time?  Oh, I've been doing it.  I just flashed some guy in a car riding next to us.  He almost crashed.  Oh, cool.  A flash bus now.  Great.  Yeah, yeah, man.  All right, well, thank you.  I've been on a few police driving behind us. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah.  Well, thank you, Vagina.  Virginia.  Well, you're welcome, darling.  Bye-bye.  All right.  All right, guys.  Yeah.  I think we're going to have Virginia flash the only guy who hasn't seen her breasts today  yet.  Who, Ziggy?  No, the bus driver, Bob.  Oh.  Who's been doing an awesome job with the bus.  What did Ziggy think of her boobs?  Those are beautiful.  Right up in front of the white line.  There he goes.  I got you.  Here we go.  One, two. 
[03:21:30]  How's that, Bob?  Very good.  Where's my headache?  Where's my headache?  All right, Rick.  How close are you guys to the studio?  I guess it's the fire.  When are we doing it again?  How close are we to the studio there, Bob?  From the city.  What I understand is a lot of traffic.  All right.  All right.  A lot of traffic.  We're probably about 15 minutes from the tunnel. 
[03:22:00]  So we're going to try and get in there as soon as we can.  All right.  We've got to take a quick break.  We'll check in with you one last time next, okay?  You got it, man.  All right.  There's Rick on the homeless bus.  Doing a great job today.  An awesome job today.  Everyone ending their emails with, is that a train?  Great instant feedback coming in right now.  Bob from Jersey.  You guys got to end the show with, what's that, a train?  Guys, that's got to be bit of the week.  Mark says, no, it's a frigging Winnebago.  Yeah, it's a damn train.  Bang. 
[03:22:30]  Apparently, New Jersey Transit has added a new station stop.  It's called Uptight A-Hole.  Is that a train?  Wham, ouch.  Everyone ending their emails with, is that a train?  Very good.  It has to be, people want it on the website.  Is that a train?  It's got to be on the website.  Is that a train?  Ha ha.  You're damn right it is.  I laughed so hard, my dad thought I was having a seizure.  I bet the chief is going to be building a teepee in his pants. 
[03:23:00]  This chick sounds hot.  Oh, yeah, since I'm a conformist.  Is that a train?  Oh, wow.  My God.  Very cool.  Everyone checking in with that.  Oh, too funny.  Louie, you're next on FM Talk.  Hey.  Hey.  How you doing over there?  All right.  Oh, man, what a show today, guys. 
[03:23:30]  Cool.  You know, it's funny, man.  When you guys really first started this thing, when you really came out and said,  you know what, let's get a bus, let's ride a bunch of homeless people.  You know, I really didn't think this was going to happen, man.  Not at all.  Not the way that it did, man.  This is awesome.  No, thanks.  All right, man.  Man, I got people calling me up and saying, Louie, listen to that.  Listen to that.  It's unbelievable.  All right, this is cool, man.  Keep it up.  All right, Louie.  Good.  Thank you.  All right.  Allison.  Allison wants to get naked for us.  Allison.  Hi.  How you doing?  All right.  Hey, Allison, come on.  This is embarrassing. 
[03:24:00]  I can't believe she wants to get naked for Opie and Anthony, Robin.  Yes.  I'm so impressed with you today.  Shut up, Jackie.  You guys are wonderful.  I can't believe...  Whose idea was this, anyway?  A lot of people.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Great.  So you're a team effort.  So you want to get naked because of today's show?  Yes.  Are you hot?  Yes, I'm very hot.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Give us a call tomorrow.  Okay, sounds good.  All right, thank you.  You're welcome.  I had to cut her off because Rick's back on the bus.  Uh, Rick?  One.  Yeah. 
[03:24:30]  Oh.  What are you doing?  Oh, we were just going to start singing some more Christmas carols.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, we were going to sing the first page.  The first page?  Let me see what...  Yeah, you know the first page?  Oh, no.  Yeah, I know.  Are you ready?  One, and a two, and a three.  Here we go.  All I want for Christmas is my new front seat.  My new front seat.  My new front seat.  All I want for Christmas is my new front seat.  And I could wish you married Christmas. 
[03:25:00]  All right.  So they can't read.  Yeah, they got little lyric sheets.  Yeah.  Very good, Rick.  Oh, the guys are in a good mood.  A bunch of them are taking little naps.  We're heading back.  Napping again.  We're coming up to the tunnel.  They napped on the way there.  They napped on the way back.  Has any listeners driven up in the cars and given you waves and stuff?  Oh, yeah.  We got people still honking at us, waving.  They still want to see...  You guys want to see some boobs again? 
[03:25:30]  Yeah!  Ah, something we all have in common.  You're a two of this brass.  Let's see him.  Let's see him!  Come on, Chief.  Come on, Virginia!  Chief, get your woman.  No, it's his woman.  My squaw.  You know she's my squaw.  Chief, get your squaw to drop her top.  Oh, my God.  Chief's going to kill her.  Here we go.  Oh, look at her.  Virginia fun bags.  I'm beating on her boobs right now. 
[03:26:00]  He's beating on stuff, but it ain't her boobs.  Oh, look at those boys.  Come on, man.  Come on.  Come on.  There you have it.  Rick, awesome job today, man.  All right, guys.  Hopefully we had our mission accomplished.  We got these guys some good stuff.  They walked out of there with bags of stuff. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  I believe the homeless shopping spree was a great success today, Rick.  Oh, yeah.  And I think...  Hey, you guys appreciate it.  We hope it's good for you guys today.  Hey, is that a train?  What's that, Rick?  Hey, Rick.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't see it.  I can't believe it. 
[03:27:00]  I can't believe the train took out the homeless bus on the way back to New York.  The homeless people, they're a new chick.  All gone.  Wow.  Hey, Mike, you're next on FM Talk.  What's up?  Hey, how you doing?  I was just at the mall.  Yeah.  It was crazy.  It was like a mob scene.  Yeah.  There was so many people that everybody was going crazy. 
[03:27:30]  Everybody started chanting, Spaz sucks.  Well, that's a staple chant when you get our fans together.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  Cool.  It was the best thing you guys have ever done around here.  You guys got to come back here more.  We will.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right, Mike.  We'll actually show up.  Yeah, we will next time.  Denise, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  All right.  Absolutely hilarious today.  Oh, cool.  I was walking around the mall all day waiting for you guys. 
[03:28:00]  I'm kind of upset you aren't there because I have a huge crush on Opie.  Wow.  And all of a sudden, all of these cops were right in front of me.  Marcus, seriously, like five police officers.  And I knew you guys were there.  Well, you guys weren't, but, you know.  Yeah.  Rick and them.  And so we ended up seeing them.  And I'm really upset I couldn't get through sooner because I was in this one store.  And there was, like, some gay black guy all upset and totally distraught that you guys  were in the mall.  And I wanted to call in and tell you to get them to go into that one store. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Well, we had enough people helping us out today, but we appreciate it.  And next time you guys have to go.  We will.  We're actually trying to throw a last-minute party together before we go on vacation for  a week and a half.  So listen tomorrow.  We might have more details on that.  All right.  Cool.  All right, Denise.  Thank you.  See you later.  All right, Rick's on the line.  I hear there might be some survivors.  Rick?  Guys.  Yeah.  We got the bus off the track just in time, but we do have survivors. 
[03:29:00]  Survivors.  This goes out to all of the homeless on the bus.  When the big train hit, some people perished, but Rick and others went on to become survivors.  All right, guys.  I'm out.  We'll see you later.  All right.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Hey, Rick.  Great job today, man.  Yeah.  Thanks, dude.  All right, man.  Peace.  Bye.  Some guy works at the Sharper Image store in Short Hills Mall.  Yeah.  Said it was the best work day of his life. 
[03:29:30]  It was hilarious.  I had a homeless guy ask me if I have CD-RS.  What the hell is a homeless guy going to do with recordable CDs?  All the workers at the mall were giving each other updates on where you guys were.  We loved it.  Oh, cool.  The best thing was the look on the faces of those stupid rich people.  You guys are great.  All right, man.  You know, with that, let's call it a day.  Let's, uh...  Absolutely.  We got a lot of here.  We got a very busy Opie and Anthony show tomorrow.  Yes.  You know what?  We're going to go on record right now. 
[03:30:00]  We're not even going to attempt to beat today's show tomorrow.  No.  But, uh, we're going to try, uh, to at least come close.  We have the Russian model come in, coming in tomorrow to be lesbian for a day.  Yeah.  We have a 73-year-old lady that wants to get naked for us tomorrow.  Yeah.  I believe Jay Moore is coming back tomorrow.  Oh, if you know who else is stopping in for a little bit tomorrow, actually, live in  our studios tomorrow will be my mother and Sal. 
[03:30:30]  Oh, no.  Are coming in.  Oh, no.  Uh, live.  So, uh...  We really haven't talked to them since, uh, they were mad at us.  No, they were very angry, so, uh...  One of our bits that we did last week.  Yeah, my mother and Sal are coming in live tomorrow.  Also, very busy day on the show.  All right.  So, thank you very much for listening.  We appreciate it.  We'll see you guys tomorrow, too.  Yes.  And hopefully, uh, we can get that, uh, party together before we go on vacation.  Well, yeah.  All right?  All right, man. 
[03:31:00]  All right.  Details tomorrow if we have any. </pre>
