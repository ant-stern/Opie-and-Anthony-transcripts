<pre> We are here, we are live.  Believe it or not, it's Ope and Anthony.  Wow, what the hell time is it?  I just woke up.  We put down the remote control, we got off the computer, we turned off the porno.  We are live for this fine Thursday, December 16, 1999.  Anthony, a very exciting day for the Ope and Anthony show.  Yes.  Today, as you know, is the big day.  We are sending a busload of homeless people to one of the fine malls in Jersey to do some Christmas shopping, Anthony. 
[00:30]
 Each one of our homeless people will receive $102 to spend any way they like at this fine mall in Jersey.  Oh, there's the mall. We know for sure now. Very good, very good.  When are we going to tell people what mall it is? When we get real close?  I figure we are about 15-20 minutes away.  We have to give our faithful listeners a chance to join us at the mall to have some fun. 
[01:00]
 Right.  They have 102 minutes to spend the $102, Anthony.  Man, we are excited. We have the bus outside, the homeless people are gathering outside our studio as we speak.  I have to say, they are better dressed than you and I.  I know.  How did that happen?  The finest bunch of homeless people I have ever seen.  I think the shelter kind of made sure they dressed up for today.  Really?  Yes. I am embarrassed because they look better than we do. 
[01:30]
 I saw like suits and stuff out there.  You have to mess them up a little bit.  Really?  I am going to roll around in the park or something.  Get some charcoal and get their faces all messed up.  You want them in blackface though?  Not necessarily blackface, just grime up a little bit.  We want them all scabby and stuff.  Jeez, man.  But we do, right? 
[02:00]
 Yes. Their hot sandwiches just arrived too.  We have the homeless people from the shelter.  Ben, as we speak, is on a bus gathering up the rest of them, the ones that sleep on the street around Washington Square Park and stuff.  Supposedly those guys are the real treats.  Those are like the cuckoo cuckoo.  Oh really?  Oh yes.  We are just waiting for Ben to come back with the other homeless people and we are going to start the festivities.  Joey!  Joey from Paisano in the studio. 
[02:30]
 What do you got me here, Joe?  You didn't get me any food because I haven't seen you lately?  You don't come in and see me.  He doesn't.  This is okay, right?  Come on.  Oh, a big can of fried ravioli.  What about me?  I see who else is around here.  You don't come by and see him kiss the ring every so often?  You don't get squashed?  Did I disrespect you, Joey?  I don't know.  Ah, he's serious. 
[03:00]
 A little bit.  A little bit.  Sauce.  Oh, Joey, you rule, man.  Hey, Ann, are you going to share some of that fine Paisano food or what?  Hell no.  Son of a bitch.  Son of a bitch.  Mmm.  Can I have some?  Ravioli.  I always knew that Anthony was your favorite, you bastard.  He's a stallion.  I understand that.  I understand that.  I wasn't going to try to attempt to compete for your friendship.  You've got to stop by more often, man. 
[03:30]
 Come in, show your face.  This will fix you.  Come on, you really didn't bring me any food?  Now I'm hurt.  I mean, it's all fun and games, but now I'm deeply hurt.  Oh, these things are great.  This is awesome.  Wow.  It's like Spicoli when everyone's eating his pizza.  Yeah, yeah.  Spicoli just kind of looks over.  Come on, man.  What's wrong with that?  Mmm, you'll get nothing unlike it.  It's all right.  It's not our time.  Where was I?  Oh, so Ben's getting the rest of the homeless people.  They're eating as we speak outside.  They're eating outside.  They're eating outside.  They're eating outside. 
[04:00]
 They're eating outside.  They're eating outside.  They're eating outside.  They're eating outside.  They're eating outside.  You're eating as we speak outside, right?  Outside the studio?  Yeah.  God, put down the paesano food for a minute.  Also, the fried ravioli is like the best-ridden thing.  It's like crack, I swear to God.  Oh, man.  All right, so also the homeless people get a homeless prize package, courtesy of us at  FM Talk, Anthony.  Their prizes include a wool blanket, a wool hat, a pair of socks, a hot sandwich, a pair 
[04:30]
 of gloves, Anthony.  Some of the prizes that were not approved by the fine management of FM Talk, tickets  for the Rosie O'Donnell Show, a brick, a cardboard box, half a bologna sandwich, bottle of Mad  Dog 2020, a bag of cans, and a shopping cart.  Wow.  We were not allowed to put those in the prize package.  I can definitely see why.  The Rosie Show wouldn't give us tickets.  Oh, really?  But we're ready to go.  That bitch.  We are just about ready to go.  I think we're going to talk to some of the homeless people before we go, right? 
[05:00]
 Yeah.  Look, everyone's on the phone lines begging to find out what mall we're going to.  Seth, what's going on?  Yeah, what's going on?  I listen to you guys all the time.  I'm here in Jersey.  I actually have a Christmas present for you, too.  Oh, cool.  Britney Spears related.  And I have a little appointment to go to today, but I definitely need to know.  Maybe when you take me off the air, one of all you guys are going to be at.  I can't listen for the next hour, but I want to do a little shopping, and I'm here in Jersey. 
[05:30]
 I want to see some homeless people, because of the mayhem.  I think if everything goes as planned, we'll tell everyone the mall by 4 o'clock.  Oh, 4 o'clock?  Yeah, by 4 o'clock.  It might be soon.  It just depends when they're close, if they don't hit traffic and all that.  I recommend Garden State Plaza.  It's right off of the bridge.  You can take roof four right there.  It's 17.  Garden State Plaza is going to be a lot of people at a night.  And you can get a lot of the rich upper class to scare the crap out of them.  All right, Seth.  Well, I got the name of the mall in front of me, and I can't tell you which one at this time. 
[06:00]
 Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Ant is not even in on the show today because of Joey.  Thanks, Joey.  Jay, one.  How's it going, Owen?  What's up, guys?  Marzol just handed him a crack pipe.  Rick wants one more.  Here's another one more.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Listen, I heard you guys mention Washington Square Park over there.  Yeah.  Hey, back in my day, I used to go there and get my mescaline.  You know what I'm saying?  All I know is that my first trip over, I seen those bums out there and I was scared to death of them. 
[06:30]
 I was saying, man, these guys are going to kill me.  Well, a few of those guys are coming with us today.  You know what?  On the homeless shopping spree.  The funny thing, I was just telling the staffs on hold.  I said, man, when I was coming out all tripping and bugging, they were looking like Barney.  They were looking like Ronald McDonald.  Man, they actually look better.  I wanted to go dance with those guys.  There you go.  It's going to be a lot of fun today.  Awesome, guys.  I wish you guys all the luck in the world.  I know with the Jersey troopers, you know.  All right, thank you.  Get the show going, guys.  All right.  I have an announcement to make.  First restaurant to bring me food becomes my favorite restaurant in New York. 
[07:00]
 First restaurant to bring the oasters of food becomes his favorite restaurant.  Is that it?  It's come down to that, Anthony.  That's terrible, though.  Yeah, it's terrible.  Joey's right here.  It's terrible as you stuff your face.  You son of a bitch.  I'm going to bring him another wet tuna sandwich.  All right.  Yeah.  Tony, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going?  All right.  Listen, I got about eight cars ready to go, and I want to know what time the homeless caravan's leaving. 
[07:30]
 Where's your caravan right now?  We are just about to go into the Midtown Tunnel.  Are you really?  Yeah.  Didn't we tell people that they could follow our bus if they get to 57th and 7th?  All right.  We're going to leave by 3 o'clock.  By 3 o'clock.  By 3 o'clock.  All right.  I wanted to know, is there any way you guys could make a stop-off and drop these guys off at my ex-wife's house for a little while?  How much money you got?  We'll do that.  I got plenty.  All right, man.  Thank you. 
[08:00]
 Also on the bus, we're going to have the homeless people singing Christmas carols and stuff.  Yeah.  Some of the songs we picked out are just brutal, though.  Who picked out All I Want for Christmas is My Two Front Teeth?  I mean, that's me.  That's a little harsh.  That's a little harsh.  I can't wait to hear their rendition of Feliz Navidad.  All right.  Well, Steve from The Unofficial Website is here.  He's going to be documenting the whole thing on video.  Yes, he's got his camera with him.  So we can get some clips on The Unofficial Website.  Sickboy is here from XWrestling.com to help out Steve, and it's going to be a lot of fun. 
[08:30]
 He's going to assist.  Channel 7 at a mall in Jersey.  Eric, what's going on?  Hey, you got the news crews out here, man.  At what mall?  Bridgewater Commons.  All right.  Channel 7's here.  I heard that there was Channel 2 and another one.  No, it's funny.  No one knows exactly what mall we're going to yet.  Oh, of course not.  They're all just set out all over the place, assuming they know where we're going. 
[09:00]
 Honestly, there's only five people that know what mall we're going to.  Three of them are in this studio right now.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  All right.  Bye.  Too funny.  All right.  We've got to take a quick break, and then we'll talk to some of the homeless people  that are very excited to go on the homeless shopping spree.  All right, Anthony?  We have a bunch of our homeless people getting filled up on some fine food, Anthony.  Yes.  Thanks to Joey from Paisano for helping us out with food today.  And everyone is trying to figure out what mall we're going to. 
[09:30]
 I know.  The bus is going to leave by 3 o'clock, I believe.  And we're going to start the festivities.  But let's go to the phones.  Everyone's freaking out.  Bobby, what's up?  You're next at FM Park.  Yeah, guys, you got a lot of cops over here at Melville Park Mall in Jersey waiting for you guys.  Oh, yeah?  You guys are going to be raising a lot of hell if you guys come here.  The mall are smoldering.  Huh?  They don't know what to do if you guys come here.  Why are the cops all over the place?  We're trying to do a nice thing this holiday season. 
[10:00]
 Yeah, we know.  I know you guys are trying to do a good thing for these guys, but these cops don't want to  see you guys anywhere near here.  It's going to make for some great radio today, but the fact is we're doing something very,  very nice for a bunch of people this holiday season.  I know you guys are doing that, but...  Giving them a bunch of money and a bunch of stuff that they desperately need.  All right, Bobby, thank you.  No problem, guys.  All right, bye.  Bye.  John, what's going on?  John?  Yeah, what's going on, fellas?  What's up?  We're at the Short Hills Mall.  It's like a trooper jamboree on Route 24.  There had to be six, seven troopers on Route 24 and about 10 police guards in the parking 
[10:30]
 lot.  We're circling around right by North St. right now.  You're a cop?  No, no, no.  I'm just down here doing some Christmas shopping and hopefully running into some homeless.  Well, you'll have to wait and see.  No, no.  We can't tell people where we're going yet.  I understand, but drive slow, man.  You can't believe the amount of cops.  All right, thank you.  Be good, fellas.  Bye.  All right, we got a couple of our guys in the studio.  What's up, man?  What's your name?  Tom.  Hey, Tom, and who else we got?  Jose. 
[11:00]
 Jose, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  You guys are both homeless?  Yes, sir.  Living in a shelter?  Yes, shelter program.  How long have you been homeless?  I've been in the program about 80 days now.  80 days?  Yes.  What happened to you that you ended up in a shelter?  Were you living on the street for a while or?  No, I was living with friends back and forth and using too much cocaine so I had problems  with the shelter.  You still using now?  No.  No?  No.  Trying to clean up and get your life together?  I am cleaning up again.  All right, and Jose, what's your deal?  I'm living in the street, too.  You're sleeping in the street?  Yes, for two years, three months. 
[11:30]
 Two and a half years and now you're in the shelter?  Yes.  Trying to get something going?  Yes, I got to finish my school and get to settle my life.  Now what happened to you that you ended up on the street?  To drink.  A lot of tequila?  Look at you, they say tequila.  Tequila.  Looks like they feed you pretty good in the shelter though, huh?  They're taking care of you guys in the shelter though? 
[12:00]
 Yes, they do it over there.  All right, so we've got a guy that used to do a lot of coke and another guy that likes  tequila.  Are you guys excited for your homeless shopping spree?  Sure.  All right, you're enjoying the food out there?  Yes, good food.  We've got free food for you and we're going to give you guys some stuff that you desperately  need and of course the 102 bucks that you can spend any way you want when you get to  that mall.  What could you get?  Like a half gram for that?  How much?  Two dollars, nah, I'd probably get about eight full for 102 dollars.  Really? 
[12:30]
 Wow, how signs have changed.  Eight full.  Well, all right, we might want some drug dealers to show up at the mall that we're going to.  You might be able to make some quick cash before they get into the mall, Anthony.  And then a little Jose Cuervo.  Man, get the guy some tequila.  Aw, man, come on.  We can't put him out there like selfie.  No, no, no.  Come on, get him some tequila.  When was the last time you had a drink, Jose?  I got it through, I got it 60 days in the program. 
[13:00]
 60 something days.  Yeah, 60 something days.  You can't be blowing that.  Are you guys pals?  I met him in the program and you know, we became kind of tight.  Right.  Okay.  Everybody's become kind of tight, you know what I'm saying?  Right.  All right.  Well, we want you guys to have fun today without a doubt.  Cool.  And you know, oh my God, look at something.  Holy cow.  Oh my God.  You guys are normal compared to what I just saw out the door.  And this guy abuses cocaine. 
[13:30]
 This guy.  Security.  Building security.  Security.  Security.  You guys think your lives are bad.  Check out what's going on outside the door.  Oh my God.  All right.  Well, Rick, why don't we get these guys out of the way.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  You guys can be on the radio all day.  We're going to be broadcasting from the bus and everything.  So enjoy yourselves today.  Okay.  Go get some more food.  Thank you.  I'm going to try to get you some tequila, bro.  Okay.  You don't need tequila.  You're a terrible.  This guy's trying to overcome his problem that he has, get his life back together.  He's trying to get his life back together.  He's trying to get his life back together.  He's trying to get his life back together.  He's trying to get his life back together. 
[14:00]
 He's trying to get his life back together.  He's trying to get his life back together.  He's trying to get his life back together.  He's trying to get his life back together.  He's trying to get his life back together.  You don't need tequila.  You're a terrible.  This guy's trying to overcome his problem that he has, get his life back together.  You're offering him the demon that brought him down to where he is.  I hope these guys don't have weapons, man.  I swear to God.  Did you see just what walked in there?  No, I wasn't able to see that.  All right.  Let's bring a couple more guys in here.  Rick is trying to figure out who's safe to bring into the studio.  Oh, boy. 
[14:30]
 Yeah, Denise is pissed at you, Joey.  Uh, Denise.  Yes.  What's up?  I'm calling with some sympathy for Opie.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm a friend of Joey's, so I feel bad that he didn't bring him any food and I want  to know why.  He's making a statement.  I haven't been there in three months, so he's making a statement.  Oh, you got to tell Joey that his wife is on the phone.  Who's on the phone?  His wife is on the phone, and she says that you got to bring Opie food.  He usually does, but... 
[15:00]
 Yeah, who's stiff?  Who's stiff?  Spiff or stiff?  Denise?  Yes?  Who's the spiff or stiff guy?  Spiff, with a P. He's my husband.  You know a spiff?  Here, Joey.  No.  Joey says he doesn't know any spiffs.  It's Tom Tommy.  He knows a bunch of spits, but...  He knows a bunch of spits, but...  Okay.  Oh, come on.  Oh, that's terrible.  What's up?  How are you?  Now he knows you.  How's the baby?  She's good.  She's good.  I'm telling you, you can't bring Opie food.  His laugh makes me die.  Yeah, he used to be my friend. 
[15:30]
 He used to eat and see me, and now he knows he can't come back.  Oh, come on.  Give poor Opie a break.  He's a big time now.  He doesn't stop that.  Denise, it's because I'm not, you know, Italian.  I always knew it.  Come on, I was going to do it.  I always knew it.  He just dumps us down and says, hi, Em.  I got to go find a corned beef restaurant, then.  No, no, no.  You guys got to come down to my husband's bar.  He'll feed you.  All right, Denise.  Thank you for calling and sticking up for me.  All right.  Take care, guys.  You suck.  It's very rare when someone sticks up for me.  Thank you.  Sean, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  I'm taking off for work to see these guys running around the mall.  All right.  And I had a question.  Are you going to booze these boys up before they get there or what?  They do that themselves.  All right. 
[16:00]
 Take the fifth.  I take the fifth.  I take the fifth.  I take the fifth.  All right.  That's why I went up.  I think the one guy who, you know, abuses cocaine, he's not going to be doing any lines today,  but I'm going to take the fifth.  I'm going to take the fifth.  I'm going to take the fifth.  I'm going to take the fifth.  I'm going to take the fifth.  I'm going to take the fifth.  I'm going to take the fifth.  All right.  Thank you.  Sean.  All right.  Rick, let's bring in a couple more.  Bring in a couple of guys that Ben just found because this is all I got.  Ben has been spending weeks trying to find the best homeless people.  Ben, come on in here, man.  What's up, man?  Hey.

[18:00]
 We're going to have fun on the bus.  We're giving you some, we're giving you like a hat, a blanket, what else?  Socks, feeding you, gloves, and a hundred and two dollars spending money.  Go and grab some presents or something.  Well, Gray Wolf, welcome to FM Talk.  We're going to be loading the bus very soon.  Who's this guy?  Is that the Peace Pike?  What do you got there?  This is the flute.  He's got a flute.  Oh, could you play the flute for us, Gray Wolf? 
[18:30]
 Native American Indian music.  Yeah, you can lower the mic.  Maybe someone lower the mic for Gray Wolf there.  Must be like in the desert.  Arizona. 
[19:00]
 Yeah, it's like the desert.  I'm like going to the desert.  Ah.  All right, Gray Wolf, everyone.  You don't have any Tomahawks in there or anything.  Do you play that on the street for some change or what? 
[19:30]
 It's just how I make a living on the streets.  Right on man.  I worked one year with Native Spirit on the subway.  I worked also with Polk Simon and Ozzon Conchill.  Oh cool.  Do you know any Christmas songs on that thing?  Yeah, I could do maybe a year or so this time.  Alright.  We're trying to get to know our new friends Anthony before they board the bus for the mall  in Jersey.  Alright, I think that one needs a little work but not bad. 
[20:00]
 A little bit.  Thomas?  Get closer to the mic.  What's your deal Thomas?  Well, I just catch work wherever I can anytime I can.  And well I also do recycling things. 
[20:30]
 You know, redeemables, stuff.  I run up to the redemption setup on 11th Avenue, that's 52nd Street.  We also have a nice shift up there as well running from 5 to, I'm sorry, 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.  So you collect the cans and get over there with your stuff?  What do you mean by the?  Well, that's one thing I do.  Anything I catch is also work off the books.  I don't have the world's easiest time at that when I do catch something. 
[21:00]
 What do you usually catch?  As far as work goes, what do you usually catch?  Well, it had been at the flea market on 6th Avenue.  Harder than the David Pella interview the other day.  I went to 26th Street recently.  I was there.  Okay.  Now how long have you been homeless?  Let's say too long.  Like how long? Seriously?  Longer than you can remember? 
[21:30]
 Let's say about the better part of seven years or so.  Wow.  Yeah, where'd it go wrong for you?  You know?  A lack of work.  Any boozing or anything like that in your past?  More like my self esteem fell off a lot.  I just gave up.  Just didn't care too tough.  So I help a few good people here and there.  I'm trying to get myself back on track again.  Right on.  Well, we have a fun day for you planned here.  A little field trip. 
[22:00]
 We're going to give you $102 to spend any way you want in the mall.  We're feeding you guys and giving you like a prize package.  Are you going to stay awake?  You look a little tired.  You all right?  Let's put it like this.  For me it's an adventure living out of a locker.  I understand that.  And if I had my way about it,  some of that money would go up on January's rent where I got to pay my storage.  All right.  And Manhattan, many stores, they're good.  They're real good.  I'm grateful for it.  All right, cool.  Thomas and then Gray Wolf, right? 
[22:30]
 Yeah.  All right, we got to take a quick break, Anthony.  All right, the bus is leaving in about 20 minutes to that fine mall in Jersey  so these guys can spend $102 any way they like for this holiday season.  Absolutely.  We're going to talk to a few more of the guys in just a bit.  Stay right there.  All right, this is FM Talk at 1027 Talk.  You can't ignore it.  It's Opie and Anthony.  The homeless shopping spree about ready to take off, Anthony.  I'm just glad we got a guy named Gray Wolf.  Gray Wolf, yeah. 
[23:00]
 Gray Wolf.  He'll be playing the flute on the bus.  Yeah.  Joey is like stupefied over there.  A little background music.  All right.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Okay.  All right, hold on.  John, what's up?  Oh, guys, this is like a big cop out.  What do you mean?  Jersey City is like the armpit of the East Coast.  Jersey City is not a nice mall.  There's a bunch of nice malls in Jersey. 
[23:30]
 Trust me.  Yeah, I know, but you're going to Jersey City, aren't you?  Who told you that?  Everyone thinks they know what mall we're going to.  Everyone thinks they know.  Everyone thinks.  Because these guys fit right in in Jersey City.  We made sure we found a very nice mall.  See, we need the contrast.  I hope it's one of those weighty toyy joints.  This is how this bit works.  I've been to a bunch of malls where these guys would fit in perfectly.  All right.  We need the contrast, and we will have the contrast.  And we're going to announce the mall in about an hour, sir.  Yeah, because I know you guys too well to think that you would bring them to Jersey City. 
[24:00]
 No, no, no.  You're going to do it. You do stuff right.  You'll see. You'll be proud of us.  Okay.  Thank you, John.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Got to say hi to Keith the cop.  Keith helps us a lot on the radio show, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  And Keith is one of the guys that has been rounding up some of the homeless people, right, for us?  Yeah, we found a few guys that were looking to...  What is he looking for on the floor, that guy?  He dropped a couple of tables.  Okay.  A couple of the people that could use $102. 
[24:30]
 It's going to take a leak, isn't it?  What is he looking for?  Ben, are you to thank for this?  Are you to thank for this?  I'm partially responsible.  Where did you find this?  What do you mean?  Read through old copy.  I'm downtown.  I'm downtown.  Yeah.  What is that guy doing?  What's his name? 
[25:00]
 Get him on mic.  He's reading the rock faxes and all the like industry insider things.  What's your name, bro?  Ziggy.  Hey, Ziggy, what's happening?  I love your comic strip.  It's funny.  Hey, Ziggy, you've ever been to Paisano?  I sort of.  I read comic books.  Oh, yeah.  I saw that guy cutting homework.  What did you do with it?  I got cut homework carrying a bottle of Devo up the steps.  It broke on the steps and I got two cuts on it. 
[25:30]
 And all the barking.  I had my mother put my hand underneath the faucet.  You could still see them.  Really?  Sure.  Then after that, I went to a glass window.  Yeah.  I got two glasses of...  They stuck in my hand.  It's impossible how it didn't go through the rest of the body.  The police brought me to the hospital and they were trying to take their thing out, but they couldn't take it out. 
[26:00]
 Ziggy, watch out.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Ziggy, watch out.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Oh, that hurt.  Ow.  Oh, that hurt.  That hurt.  Oh, watch the debris.  This guy from...  Wow.  Take a train. 
[26:30]
 This guy fell on a thing that was fighting.  Fighting on a...  But he got hurt.  He got hurt and he's got a force.  All right, Ziggy.  But he wanted to fight the weather.  But I wanted to fight the weather.  But I wanted to go.  He wanted to fight, but I wanted to go.  Because I was fighting over a girl and he wanted to fight and I wanted to go.  Right.  I'll tell you, Ziggy made the cocaine look really normal at this point.  And then I fell down with a big bottle of Coca-Cola.  Yeah.  Right.  And I stretched my fingers.  I went to the hospital and the guy stuck a paper clip to his thumb. 
[27:00]
 To get the border.  Yeah.  Just give Ziggy two bucks.  He won't know the difference.  All right, Ziggy.  He can save a hundred for dinner later on.  Ziggy, where do you live?  In the beginning, I broke my leg.  I thought maybe a direct question might help.  No, there's no...  Ziggy, where do you live?  Anyplace.  Anyplace?  Anyplace.  You got a place for me to sleep?  Yeah.  Any place?  Any place.  Any place.  Any place.  Any place.  Any place.  Any place. 
[27:30]
 Any place.  Any place.  Any place.  Any place.  Any place.  Any place.  Any place.  Any place.  Any place.  Any place.  Any place.  Any place.  Any place.  Any place.  Any place.  Any place.  Any place.  Any place.  Any place.  Any place.  Any place.  Any place.  And if I had to spend 10 bucks for a hundred or greater, that would be okay for me too.  So I really would advice you to maybe use a larger stamina, which I don't usually use,  and I want you to have, you know, Robja 자�báήσ alright?  But this is average.  We're gonna weigh far in size until you're ready.  Very much ready.  He'll be a rather old man for eating.  Yeah. 
[28:00]
 Yeah.  Very much.  Yeah.  Do you have money on your pocket?  and stuff or some warm clothes, whatever you need.  Alright?  I got an announcement to all our homeless friends.  We're not arresting anyone today.  A lot of people are very paranoid that they came here to get arrested.  That's not the truth.  No.  We are definitely taking care of you guys today.  Going to a mall.  Going to a mall.  Take a little bus ride.  Have some fun.  Well Keith, what is this guy's deal?  You found him.  Keith the cop.  I'm a little rock and roll guy. 
[28:30]
 I think this guy used to work here at any company.  Hey, it's Scottsville.  But it wasn't as big.  It was just a plain station with no equipment in it.  Well thank you Ziggy.  What does Ziggy's deal?  Ziggy's just a guy, a local guy from downtown that caught on his luck.  So we figured we'd bring him up to the mall.  And we're going to get him out of there.  Yeah.  What does Ziggy's deal?  Ziggy's just a guy, a local guy from downtown that caught on his luck.  So we figured we'd bring him up. 
[29:00]
 Do the locals take care of him down there hopefully?  Yeah, he gets a lot of beer.  You like drinking the beers there Ziggy?  At least I say that everybody's weak.  That's all, you know.  We drink the beers, stay out of everyone's way.  What the hell?  What was the king of beers?  That's what I would say.  What was the king of beer?  We got something in common.  There you go.  I'm sure our sponsors will love that endorsement.  Maybe you could be the voice of Budweiser or something.  Would you like a beer Ziggy? 
[29:30]
 It doesn't matter, he had everyone booing with voice.  Yeah that's true, you know.  He probably read the memo that said no alcohol allowed in the studio.  Alright well let's hear it for Ziggy.  Ziggy, Merry Christmas.  Enjoy your little trip.  You probably don't get out of Manhattan much I guess, huh?  This is like a star.  Is this recorded?  No this is live.  Is there anyone you want to say hi to Ziggy?  Wow, this is amazing.  Somebody must have heard of this. 
[30:00]
 A lot of people have heard.  A couple of people.  Just a couple.  You're going to find that you have a lot of fans when you reach that mall today.  And we're encouraging our faithful listeners to take care of some of our new friends, alright?  So when you make new friends on the street,  just tell them you can come up to the radio station anytime.  It's Wilton Darvis at K-Rock.  Send them all up there.  If you're looking for free food, go to the Pizano's or Mopar's too.  No wonder Joey didn't bring anything. 
[30:30]
 He is done, Joey.  All it would have taken was a plate of food, Joey.  You're done.  Oh man, I'm totally sticking with Joey on this one.  Joey, how you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  There you go.  How you doing?  Alright, very good.  Is there anyone else we want to talk to before the bus takes off, Rick?  I think we're ready to rock.  You're ready to rock?  Alright.  I think you can take the manuscript.  Yeah, you can take the manuscript if you like.  Take one piece of paper. 
[31:00]
 That's alright.  We've got plenty of paper.  You can have all the books.  You can have all the paper you want.  You can take as much paper as you want.  There you go.  Hey, Ziggy.  Take that with you, Ziggy.  Steve Ziggy knows a quick Christmas song as we go to break.  Oh, sure.  Ziggy, do you know any Christmas songs?  Yeah, I know a Christmas song.  I like all of them.  You want to sing one real fast for us?  I think I can sing it.  Alright, let's go.  Silent night, holy night, always come, always bright. 
[31:30]
 I didn't have a peg to pronounce that.  S maneira wguиком gratib te rm i, 
[32:00]
 medetaêva II.  Good morning, everybody.  It is fashionable Billie Eilish in Louisiana including her old video production took place  about the Tariq and his wife.  I think you should be on this show of course.  sing that song and put it on TV. There you go, let's hear it for Ziggy. Next week Ziggy's  IPO hits the market at Ziggy.com. We're going to take a quick break and round everybody  up outside. We're going to take them downstairs to the bus. Alright, Rick's got the cell phone.  We'll check in with you outside as everyone loads the bus and we'll talk to a few more 
[32:30]
 guys, okay? What happened? What happened? My eyes are tearing. Oh really? Okay. I'm  going to go get a drink. Alright, fellas, let's rock. Alright. Come on, Zig. Alright,  have fun, Ziggy. You can take that paper with you. I'd like to just take it with me. Yeah,  you can take it with you, man. You can have that. Ziggy rocks, man. Yeah, thanks. That's  not nice. Well, at least no one saw it. Psycho Mark is fraying down the area Ziggy just took 
[33:00]
 over. A little lice hole. Wow. A little lice hole. There is a little bit of a wasp coming  off of Ziggy. Okay, you might want to bring that up the bus with you. Alright, why don't  you guys go down the bus and we'll check in with you down there. You know what the funniest  thing is? I turn to my right and I see Joey from Paisano sitting here. It's like there  have been days I've seen a smile pasted across his face and we've had naked girls dancing  on lesbian day and stuff. Today he's just sitting here pissed. He just looks pissed. 
[33:30]
 Like you put Ziggy right next to me. Ziggy was like three feet from Joey from Paisano.  Ziggy is going to get the best table in the house. Alright, Larry, what's going on? That's  the same smell you know when you're talking is going bad, right, Joey? That's the another  throw out of the show. Holy cow. Hey, Larry, you're next on FM Talk. Am I? Yeah, what's  up? Okay, I want to know if you guys are taking them into parameters. I mean, if you're taking 
[34:00]
 the Riverside Square Mall, which is like high class beyond all belief, or Garden State,  which is like the ultimate mall in North Jersey, what you got to do is ditch these homeless  people in Hackensack and no one will be worth for the wear. You won't even notice that they're  around. We're going to announce the mall. We're going to 20 minutes before we get there,  okay? Aw man, because I want to get there with my camera. I got to get pictures of you  guys are going in parameters. Right on. Well, hang tight to the radio. You'll find out soon  I'm old man. All right, man. Thank you. Who are these guys, Rick? They don't look homeless.  These are the Opie and Anthony Security. All right. What do we got? Chuck. Hey, Chuck, 
[34:30]
 what's up? Yeah, I'm on. Oh, he did. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Are you guys excited to  help us out today? We got a we got a hell of a crew out there. Huh? Yeah. Yeah. You met  the Viggy. Yeah. Yeah, we got we got some kind of Indians. All right. Hey, they don't  want to shop. So they want a pocket of money. Oh, no, they're shopping. They have to shop. 
[35:00]
 Right. Got to shop. I think what's going to happen, they'll shop. And then if some of  our faithful listeners, you know, show up at the mall, maybe they can help us out and  give the homeless people some money they could take with them would be a very nice gesture  today. Just so we were going to let you know that in case anybody tried to boot our our  shoppers, we got the harassment and trespassing statutes with us. Awesome. All right. We got  a with us. We got we have cops. Anthony, we got a lawyer on the bus. Yeah, going to happen. 
[35:30]
 I got to look up with the lawyer. He's out there. All right, guys. Thank you. We'll talk  to you guys on the bus. Nice meeting you. Godspeed. I have to have a beer together after this.  All right. All right. All right. Security detail. Wow. Let me tell you something. The  studio rigs, man. I smell that. Yeah, it's really bad. It was OK until the big maester  came. Oh, I bet I bet he hasn't seen a shower and God, it's probably been a long time. We 
[36:00]
 got a with this mall. It's more of a fight than I swear to God. Look at Ron on line 11.  11. Hey, Ron, you're next to the FM talk. What's up? Hey, O.A. What's up? All right.  Come on. That wasn't a homeless guy named Ziggie. That was Jim Brewer doing another voice. It  was like Brewer, wasn't it? It was, man. We got some fine pictures of Ziggie. We're going 
[36:30]
 to put it on the unofficial website. You're not going to believe it. All right. Cool.  That's when I thought we are homeless people were too normal looking. Walked Ziggie walked  in and the Indian guy walked in. We're we're we're set and ready to go now, man. I don't  know who was scary, man. The Indian dude is Ziggie. I don't know. Ziggie. Ziggie. Ziggie  picked up a pile of papers that he thought it was a manuscript for some kind of movie  and wanted to read through it. It was like old like copy from old commercials and rock  boxes and stuff. And he took it with him. So all right, Ron. OK. Reading material. 
[37:00]
 All right. All right. Bye. All the good insulation. All right. Things are really. I think there  was a paisano read in there. All right. Things are starting to cook now. Oh, yeah. Next time  we talk, hopefully we'll be on the street with Rick outside the bus that the homeless  people will be boarding. Just smell what Ziggie's cooking. I can't even believe these morons.  He's a disgusting little man. What a douchebag. 
[37:30]
 Stand over. This is sicker than spaces of death. Ignore Topia and Anthony. Hey, man.  They are spraying down the studio as we speak. Oh, my God. My eyes are tearing. Yeah, it's  a little thick out there. All right. Let's go to the phone. Kenny, what's going on? Hey, 
[38:00]
 O&A. Hey. Hey, you know, just a comment about having Ziggie in there just a minute ago.  Yeah. You know, it's kind of special. Like, you know, it's almost Christmas and here's  a guy who doesn't know where he's going to sleep tonight, let alone Christmas Eve. He's  got nothing. No child to go home to see a smile when he gives him a present or something.  Yet he can belt out a Christmas carol like that and be as happy as the next guy, you  know. Well, you sound like you're getting a little choked up. No, it's just kind of 
[38:30]
 weird. This is my first Christmas with a new child, Mom. Well, I just, you know, I think  of it like what I think, you know. Hey, we are definitely having fun today and we're  going to stick it to some snooty people. But the fact is we're definitely helping people  this holiday season. You got to see that part of this, man. Ziggie's singing Silent  Night. That'll be with me forever. Yeah, that was something, huh? All right. That's it. 
[39:00]
 Just an observation. All right. Thank you. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Donna, what's going on?  Hi. How you doing? Real good. I just want to tell you that lady that called earlier  that you hit with the train. Yeah. I have to agree with her, but in the same sense, you're  doing something really great for these people. Something that like nobody else is going to  do for them. Let me tell you something. They're laughing and having a great old time, you  know, outside the studio eating and getting ready for this big day. Well, I'm coming here  cooking for a party, a Christmas party, and I'm thinking about these people. And I'll 
[39:30]
 tell you, no matter what anybody says, wherever you go, you can come to my living room and  have dinner. I don't care. All right. I mean, these people need you and you're doing good  and God bless you all. Have a great holiday. God bless us everyone. I think you would want  Ziggy to shower about 10 times though before dinner. Probably. I'll let you do that. I'm  not going to lie to you. I've never smelled anything so unbelievable in my life. Yeah.  Well, you know, some are unfortunate and some, you know, we have showers. They don't. All 
[40:00]
 right. Good. Okay. Have a great one. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Brian, what's up? Hey,  how you doing? Good. You guys have no any kind of medical support, do you? You use a  volunteer ambulance person, a medic? I think at this point, Anton, I need shots. A little  spray the Lysol. I'm not kidding, man. Yeah. We went through two cans of Lysol. Try for  breeze. All right. Okay. But you don't need no help then, huh? No. Thank you, Brian. Okay. 
[40:30]
 Bye. We'll go to Rick's on the line. We'll go to him in a second. But first, Wally. Wally,  what's up? Yeah. Oh, and what's going on guys? All right. Listen, I just wanted to warn you.  I'm over at the Bridgewater common and I want to tell you, I don't know if you guys are coming  here or not, but the cops are everywhere. Well, we have, we have our own cops. We have a lawyer  on the bus, you know, this is going to happen. But I'm just, I'm just letting you know, man,  they got Sadie and they also have the Bridgewater police and the Somerville police and they're 
[41:00]
 going to have to go through every entrance. I don't know what's going to happen, but I figured I'd  let you guys know. You know what I mean? Thank you. All right, guys. Have a great day. Everyone  thinks they know what mall we're going to. Only five people know at this point. And I, no, I  know. I'm not. I just want to give you a heads up and let you know what's going to happen. We're  going to announce them all soon though. Thank you. All right, guys. We got cops at just about all  the, all the nice malls in Jersey. You have two news crews at the malls they assume we're going  to do and they don't know where we're going. No one knows at this point. Rick. Guy. All right. Rick's 
[41:30]
 downstairs with the homeless people. How are you doing, Rick? We're doing good. We're on 57th  just in front of the Hard Rock. Okay. Any of the listeners that are going to be caravanning with  us? Um, we're just getting set. We almost had one guy already get hit by a fricking taxi.  That wasn't Ziggy, was it? No, hold each other's hands. We got to do like the school trip thing where  everybody's going to have a fun. All right. Um, as soon as we get rolling, when I tell you exactly  what, uh, you know, when we get to the, uh, certain area, I'll give you a call back. You know what I'm 
[42:00]
 talking about. I got fucking code for now, as you know. Okay. But you guys are loading the bus as we  speak. Yeah, we're loading the bus now. God damn this place is, I'm, I'm, I must be downwind from  these guys. Holy crap. Take extra care of Ziggy for us. Okay. Yeah, definitely. All right. And he  almost ran off. We had to, we had to make sure we, we, we showed them the money. Yeah. He almost ran  off. All right. And Rick, uh, next time we talk to you, have everyone singing the Christmas carol on the 
[42:30]
 bus. All right. You got it, dude. All right. There goes Rick, everyone. He's outside the building as they,  uh, they board the bus for Jersey. And there they go. Look at that on their little Christmas field trip.  Special day. Joe, what's up? You're next on FM Talk. Oh, and what's up? Yeah. Listen, why don't you give us  a hint? Like, uh, play a game. Like Simon says, or what, what highway they're taking or something.  Well, uh, direction. Honestly, we have a couple decoys out there. Really? Yeah. Because we want this to  happen. We want them to get to the mall. Okay. The next obstacle is will we get the bus, you know, to the 
[43:00]
 mall? Cause a bunch of cops called and said they're going to, you know, stop the bus and find a reason to  like impound the bus. So now I guess the next thing we got to hope for, everyone has to keep their  fingers crossed. We've got to hope that the homeless bus makes it to this fine ball in Jersey. All right.  All right. We have to go in stages. When I get, when it gets to the point of no return, that's when we'll  tell everyone what mall it is. Cause I got like a 45 minute ride to certain places. So I understand. 
[43:30]
 All right. Thanks bro. All right. If you run into the homeless people though, please take care of them.  They're going to need some extra money after this is over. Okay. You got it. All right, man. Give them some  extra money. I don't know if they're going to change or anything. All right. Thank you, Joe. Bye bye.  How's the S and P back yet? Uh, people loving it. Cool. All of them wondering where the hell they're  going. Frank, you're next on FM talk. What's up guys? All right. Great job, man. Thanks. I think this is a great  thing you're doing. You know, the, what's it called? I think it's, uh, I think it's pretty historical and people are 
[44:00]
 getting mad about it and have no sense of humor. I'll tell you one thing. They're having a lot of fun. I was kind of  bummed cause we saw the first few homeless guys and they looked better dressed than that night.  And, uh, well that's not the case anymore. I think it's great. They're having fun. It's funny for us. And, uh,  the people that ban and keep the cop got from Washington square park are priceless. Absolutely priceless.  All right, Frank. All right guys. Take it easy. You guys suck. Thank you. I can't wait till, uh, this really 
[44:30]
 exclusive mall gets the likes of, uh, gray wolf, gray wolf and Ziggy, gray wolf with his little flute.  I'll play a little tune for the mall patrons. Why not? I think Ziggy ought to go and try on some clothes.  I want Ziggy in one of the, uh, exclusive clothing stores trying on some pants. Yeah. He wants a job. So maybe he  needs a nice business. Yeah. Maybe they should try on a nice business too.  Uh, Mike. Yeah. Two things guys. Yeah. If you don't go to the short hills mall, you're dropping the ball cause that's 
[45:00]
 the snobby as fricking maw in the tri-state area. All right. All right. Two, I love everybody calling in  congratulating you guys. Let me tell you something. I'm a big fan, but you guys aren't doing this for any other  reason, but it's great radio. Give me a fricking break. We're helping these guys out. You know, we're giving  them something that they haven't had in years. Hey Mike, Mike, keep to yourself. I definitely will guys.  Good luck today. I'm waiting to hear which one you're going to. Thank you. Bye. I think Ziggy needs to go into 
[45:30]
 Saks Fifth Avenue and then maybe play with some toys. FAO Schwartz or something. Why not? All right. Well, the  phones are just going nuts. Wow. I think we need to play a couple of tunes. All right. We can do that. Spaz is running  in like crazy. I mean the media is calling. Everyone is trying to figure out where we're going. We'll play a  couple of songs before we break. What the hell? Yeah. We'll start with some Zeppelin. It's going to be a special day 
[46:00]
 on the Opie and Anthony show today. Oh yeah. More to come and just a bit. We'll check in with Rick again very soon.  All right. It's one oh two seven. It's Opie and Anthony. It's FM talk one oh two seven. And we got Rick back on the phone.  We're doing our homeless shopping today. Everyone is coming into the studio shaking their heads. What's wrong,  Char? We lost one. We lost a homeless person already? Wait, get on Mike. We lost one? We didn't lose one. He just 
[46:30]
 decided he didn't want to do it. He thought we were ripping him off. He didn't want the money. He wanted the money  just to leave. It wasn't Grey Wolf or Ziggy, was it? No, Ziggy. Ziggy is still getting it. Thank God. But they're on the bus  jetting like any minute right now. All right, cool. Thank you. What's up, Earl? Rudy and I, we were setting up the bus  and all the truckers were like beeping their horns saying Opie and Anthony and one guy screaming at the top of his lungs,  feed the homeless, feed the homeless. Well, they are getting fed. Did you see Grey Wolf couldn't even wait. He had a sandwich 
[47:00]
 and he's on the air over here. He's stuck unwrapping it and eating it. He thought it was bison. Keep them good grub.  Me get into trouble years ago with fire water. White man's fire water. Rick, what's up? Guys, what's happening? Rick's on the homeless bus  right now as we speak. Yeah, I heard you guys were a little concerned that we may have lost Ziggy or Grey Wolf. No, those guys are still here. 
[47:30]
 All right, good. Ziggy's actually setting up camp in the back seat. The only way I rousted him from his map is when I asked him if he wanted a ginger ale.  He's in good shape and he's in good spirits. All right, everyone's in a good mood right now, Rick? Yeah, looks like. Hey, you guys in a good mood  ready to spend some cash? All right, a bus full of homeless lunatics. There you have it, the coal of the wild. Very good. All right, we're about to be 
[48:00]
 flowing away from 57th Street heading to a certain bridge of unnamed... Oh yeah, jeez, can't figure that one out. Shut up, man. But yeah, we're about to pull out any second here  and we'll call you guys back in about 15, 20 minutes. All right, get Psycho Mark to organize these guys to sing one of the Christmas carols that we have for them, okay? All right, now? In a little while. 
[48:30]
 In a little while we'll do a Christmas carol. I think Texas Halls would be good. That's an easy one. Okay. There's not many words in that one. Yeah, that's true. All right, we'll talk to you in a few minutes, Rick. All right, dude. Thank you.  God, Julianne should just be indebted to us right now. We're helping the homeless problem. We're shipping them to Jersey right now. We're doing our part this holiday season, Anthony. Because of Opie and Anthony, there will be less homeless in New York.  We ought to adopt our plan. Brendan! What's going on, guys? All right. I gotta warn you guys. I live around the corner from the bridge of Water Mall. I've been driving around all day. There are cops all over Jersey. 
[49:00]
 Well, yeah, because they're Jersey cops. They're jobs. Besides that, they're out for today. All right. That does not make a difference. No one knows what mall we're going to yet.  Oh, I know that. But I'm just saying, watch it, because they're looking for you. All right. Thank you. You got it. All right. Bye. Later, guys. 
[49:30]
 Instant feedback. We got Rocco and Clifton. Bring them all into KB Toys. It would be hysterical to watch the kids scatter. That would be pretty funny. Patrick, what's going on?  Hey, nothing much. All right. I just want to congratulate you guys on what you're doing. Oh, thank you. Thank you. It's about time someone figures out what we're doing here.  Yeah. And people are calling and whining about it and saying that you're doing it for radio. But you guys deserve the credit. Oh, thanks. You're the ones who are doing it. So you should take credit for it. 
[50:00]
 OK. We are doing this for no other reason than to help the homeless on the holiday season. And if anyone gets credit for it, you guys deserve it. Come on.  Open Anthony advocates for the homeless. All right. Thank you, Patrick. All right. My God, I don't see anyone else doing anything. Joy. Yeah. What's going on? 
[50:30]
 How are you guys? All right. I work at North 
[51:00]
 Go to the perfume counters and they get all free samples. OK, they're going to have to fumigate them at the perfume counter. Super soaker full of old spice. And I also want to ask, why are you all afraid of the cops? There's nothing illegal about it.  We're not afraid of the cops. We have our own cops. We have a lawyer on the bus. So what's why are these people calling up and giving you a problem? Well, I don't know. They seem to think there'll be a problem. The Orange Land and you guys were here.  I'm waiting and actually the bartender, Christy, wants to talk to you about it because she has an opposite opinion of me. Well, we got to move on, though. Tell her to shove it up her butt. Hold on, Christy, come here. Shove it up her butt. 
[51:30]
 But there you go. He's been ranting and raving all day about this. Hold on one second. What's her problem? Here she is. Here she is. Hello? Hey, what's your problem? I think that it's pretty friggin' rude that you're bringing them here and just leaving them. Well, they're allowed to stay if they want. It's a free country. Well, why are you bringing them here instead of taking them shopping in New York? I'd be proud to have Ziggy in my neighborhood. You would? I'm not proud to have him here. Well, too bad. I don't like the mess they're going to be here in to stay here. 
[52:00]
 Have an open mind, you twat. Hey, I want to go see them. I'll go to New York again. That's where they are. That's where I live. That's where I live here.  Well, a small little handful is now coming to Jersey. Fries are up. Get back to work. I don't want to waste your time. Alright, bye. Goodbye. 
[52:30]
 Putting a damper on our little party today. Please. It's like a little handful of homeless being shipped over to Jersey today. Alright, George, what's going on?  Yeah, I just want to say, like, you always have these Hollywood types that claim to advocate certain cause-rippin' and they think they're doing something.  Here we have Opie and Anthony. Yes. They do what nobody else could do. They're actually doing something. I know it's in a small way, but you're helping out a bunch of guys. 
[53:00]
 Alright, thank you, George. And you should be praised and lauded. And the whole city of New York should thank you. We should all rent our own buses.  Alright. We should all follow your lead and then we would solve a problem here. We wouldn't be wearing ribbons or anything. You know?  Alright. You guys are doing a good thing. More power to you. Thank you.  Thank you. See that? Look at the adulation we're getting. Oh, doesn't it feel good? I got to tell you, one of the homeless guys, he's really happy because we saved him bus fare because he wanted to go to Jersey. 
[53:30]
 Oh, really? He's definitely going to stay today. Look at that. See? So not only is he getting 102 bucks to spend today at one of those fine malls, he's actually saving bus fare as well.  Getting a bus fare to Jersey, his new home, the place he will now call home.  Heyman!  Heyman.  Heyman, what's up? You know Grey Wolf?  Yeah, I know Grey Wolf. Is Ziggy a little guy who looks like his face was used like a punching bag for a long time? 
[54:00]
 Yeah.  Alright.  Don't make fun of our Zig.  No, I love the guy. Actually, both of those guys sang in the key.  The most beautiful thing about Ziggy is the cops know him and they ask him to get up off the street. He lives in front of this place called Stromboli. It's a pizza joint on First Avenue.  Okay. 
[54:30]
 On the ground. He lives on top of a garbage bag.  Well, now he's got a blanket, courtesy of the Open Ethnic Show, a wall blanket. I'm serious.  That's great.  Alright.  That's great.  Alright, cool.  Beautiful thing.  Thank you.  Beautiful things for people.  Alright.  Thank you, Sam.  Yeah.  Oh, thank you for coming in every Friday and Saturday and polluting my neighborhood.  Alright, cool.  Goodnight.  Goodnight.  Alright, Anthony.  This pole is just nuts.  Danny, what's going on? 
[55:00]
 Alright. Good.  Hey.  I'm going over to Anthony.  Yeah, you're on the air, Danny.  I can go up for a coming down the park. You guys are going.  Well, they'll know soon enough, man.  Yeah.  How much longer?  I got to check.  Alright, cool.  Have a good day.  Alright, thank you, Danny.  Bye.  Bye.  And we'll do that. We'll check in with Rick on the homeless bus next.  This is FM Talk at 1027 Talk. You can't ignore it. It's Opie and Anthony.  Today is the big day. We're doing the homeless shopping spree, Anthony. 
[55:30]
 Yes, we are.  Very excited as we speak. The homeless bus is on its way to Jersey.  To a very nice mall.  Oh, yeah.  Junior from Jersey on the Instant Feedback.  Just wanted to say that for the first time ever, I am afraid to shut the radio off.  Quick question. When the S hits the fan, will you guys make a statement to the press?  Because you know this will be all over the news tonight.  Be good guys. Talk hard. Junior. 
[56:00]
 Well, we do have some news crews. They're at a couple malls in Jersey,  assuming they know which mall we're going to, Anthony.  We didn't tell anyone which mall.  Yes.  Because we didn't want anyone tipped off. So pretty much there's a panic all over Jersey as we speak.  I got a little description of the mall that they're going to.  Okay.  Very luxurious.  Let me take a look with you.  Our homeless... 
[56:30]
 I don't know if we should even name some of the stores, Anthony.  No, I think you can just say the...  Maybe their little motto that they have, whatever it is, their little slug line.  Yeah.  An oasis of luxury minutes from Manhattan.  That's where our own homeless will be shopping.  They actually plug the mall as being an oasis of luxury.  So, you see, we're not pushing out on this one, people. Believe me.  They are going to look like the proverbial square pegs in the round hole. 
[57:00]
 An oasis of luxury.  And they better not mess with our homeless.  They are people too.  I'm looking at the list of stores and it just...  Ready?  Alright, let's talk...  One, two, three, go.  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.  Oh, what fun it is to ride in a wild, walking, riding train.  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. 
[57:30]
 We hear Grey Wolf and Grey Wolf's fluid.  Oh, what fun it is to ride in a wild, walking, riding train.  Woo!  Alright, good job, guys.  Alright, Rick.  Oh my... We almost took out a homeless guy in the street, for Christ's sake.  Holy crap.  Yeah, the homeless guy's in the bus looking out and going,  Oh, he's friggin' homeless.  Getting in the way of our trip.  We got the cheese from still playing. 
[58:00]
 We hear Grey Wolf, yes.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Oh, they're breaking out into a rap.  Let's hear a homeless rap.  You're gonna do a rap, you think you're gonna rap to?  Nah, I can't rap, man.  I'm just enjoying myself.  Put something together.  We're having fun.  I wish I was on the bus, though.  I'm trying to rap, man. 
[58:30]
 One guy's falling asleep.  Wake him up.  I was saying, wake him up, man.  He's not leaving on us.  Jesus Christ.  Nicky, how you doing, man?  I'm okay, I'm fine.  Nicky's jamming, man.  Alright, we're just about ready to cross the T.W.  Alright.  The unnamed bridge.  Okay, Rick.  Why don't you talk to a few of the other guys we haven't talked to yet?  Alright.  Anyone else want to say hi on the radio there? 
[59:00]
 What's your name, dude?  What's your name?  Keith.  Keith?  Yeah.  You want to talk to the guys real quick, Keith?  Nah, I'm cool.  I'm listening to my music now, man.  He's listening to music.  He's got a rock band.  Oh, he does?  So he's not even listening, Tops.  No, he's not even listening to the station.  I take it he's trying to win money on Hot 93 or something.  Alright.  Alright, let me talk to Ben real fast.  Alright.  Ben's in the van, actually.  Oh, Ben's following you guys, huh? 
[59:30]
 Yeah, he's in the van following.  What are you laughing at?  What are you laughing at?  I think Ziggy dropped a bomb.  They're all laughing.  Oh my goodness.  Oh, Ziggy, huh?  Oh, what in the life of?  Oh my God.  Did you guys bring Lysol on the bus?  Yeah, one of the guys is spraying right now.  Alright, very good, man.  Oh, combat pay, Keith. 
[60:00]
 Combat pay.  The LA security for the winter, combat pay.  And can people tell what bus you're on?  No, I don't think all the 1027 FM talk stickers we put all across the sides of the bus are going to tip anybody off.  I think we're pretty well camouflaged.  Oh, very nice.  Alright, Rick, anything else to report at this time?  I've got to go because we're going to start breaking up as we get ready to cross the bridge here, so we're going to lose the signal.  Great move there. 
[60:30]
 I don't know if you're familiar with the steel girders on the bridge.  Yeah, yeah.  What an ass.  Thank you, Rick.  Alright, guys, I'll check in when we get closer to the mall.  Okay, and we've got to give away the mall very soon because a bunch of listeners want to join you guys.  Yeah, I can't wait to see the Oasis that they have.  Alright, thank you.  Alright, later.  Bye.  Alright, say goodbye.  Bye.  There they go. 
[61:00]
 A bus full of homeless on their way to an exclusive mall in Jersey.  Move, doggy doggy, for more money.  Alright, thank you, Rick.  Alright, later, guys.  Let's check in with Ben, who's following the bus as we speak, Anthony.  Alright.  Hey, Ben.  Yeah.  What's going on?  What's happening, guys?  You aren't stupid enough to get on that bus, huh?  No, I'm in the nice smell-free van.  Alright.  Are you in the FM Talk van?  I am in the FM Talk van.  Alright, and you're following the bus?  Actually, right now, we're right in front of them.  Any cops following the bus at this time? 
[61:30]
 I don't see any cops at the moment.  I just see a lot of people cheering us on as we drive down the street.  There you go.  Oh, my God, it's going to be like Patton rolling into a nice European city.  Look at you.  Well, there's a lot of stages to this homeless shopping spree.  The next stage we've got to worry about.  We've got to make sure we get to the mall without the cops stopping us.  So we're all keeping our fingers crossed.  But Ben.  Yeah.  You did a great job finding these people, man.  Thank you very much.  I knew that you liked Ziggy the best.  Ziggy is a classic. 
[62:00]
 Oh, they're going to love him.  He might be a regular member on the radio show after today.  They're going to love him at that mall.  I'll tell you that.  Alright, Ben.  We'll check in with you soon, alright?  Okay, guys.  Alright, bye.  Later.  Bye.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.

 Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.

[65:30]
 Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, Ben.  I was going to, I made it a whole thing today.  I was going to go up.  I had nothing to promote.  I was going to go up just for the fun.  And then when I found out about the homeless thing, I got like 20 minutes on the homeless.  Yeah.  I hate the homeless.  Hey, Jay, how funny is this though?  We're going to the sickest mall in Jersey.  It's a great idea.  Which mall?  Short Hills?  We're not saying at this moment in time.  Everyone is guessing.  Short Hills or Paramus Park.  Look at you.  Shut up.  I'm going to say Willowbrook because that's still the homeless people anyway. 
[66:00]
 When are you back in New York?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm so pumped out.  Hey, put Rick on.  Why did he say today was no good?  He's on the bus with the homeless people.  He's not even here right now.  What the hell was he talking about?  Jay, next time you just show, please don't even call.  Yeah, you have like that.  He said tomorrow you want to be tomorrow because there's strippers.  I said I'm flying back to LA tomorrow.  Dude, we have, I mean today's a great show, but tomorrow we got the whole lesbian for a  day thing again.  We got a 73.  Lesbian what?  We do the, I want to be a lesbian for a day. 
[66:30]
 We have a lesbian.  You kind of started with the kissing cousins.  That was pretty amazing.  I think Brewer took a lot of flack that day.  Oh yeah.  You got a problem, you and Brewer?  No, he got mad at me because I went over my time at comics come home.  Oh really?  In Boston I went like 10 minutes over my time and he was on after me.  Yeah, because it was like anybody that brought up your name he was just kind of like, oh  shit, Jay Moore.  I love Brewer.  There's nothing he could do that could ever turn me against him.  Cool.  Because we like both you guys. 
[67:00]
 He's so hilarious.  But it really pissed him off that I went over because I think you had a hard time with  the first couple of jokes because the crowd was still going retarded over like, yeah.  And Brewer, believe me, anybody who's anybody that's ever seen a Jim Brewer show knows that  it's not to be taken lightly.  That guy comes with the full barrel gun.  Oh yeah.  Jim Brewer is one of the funniest guys alive.  Hey, when does this comics come home happening?  I think it's Sunday night.  It sounds like a good one.  It's signed on Comedy Central, right?  Yeah.  Hey, Rick's on the line. 
[67:30]
 You want to yell at him?  Yeah.  All right.  He's on the bus with the homeless people.  So be kind.  He's going to be homeless.  All right.  Hold on.  Hey, Rick.  Yo.  Jay Moore is on the line.  Yeah.  He told me today not to come by.  Hey, Rick, turn your radio down.  All right.  Hold on.  Is Rick the one with the loud radio playing in the background?  Yeah.  Turn that down.  Because he should be smacked.  All right.  Try it again.  There we go.  Hey, Rick.  Yo, Jack.  You told me today not to come by.  It wasn't a good day, right?  No.  I said today is not going to be as good a day as tomorrow.  It's not going to be as good. 
[68:00]
 Because I understood your request through Joey that you were looking to see certain types  of gas.  So believe me, tomorrow is a gas fest.  Yeah.  But first and foremost, I just wanted to hang with the guys to prove to them that I was down  with nothing to promote, with nothing to...  Yeah, we believe you.  Well, I wanted to come up and hang out.  Anytime, man.  Well, you know, today is not a good day.  Instead of spending another 40 minutes on the phone with us, get your ass down here.  I can't.  I got no space. 
[68:30]
 I got stuff to do.  Even Joey's getting pissed.  Come on, Jay.  You promised.  Jay, I called you at 11 o'clock this morning...  Joey, you called me for dinner last night, by the way.  Really?  Oh, man, that's not right.  You charged the Hollywood star?  Get all that money.  I don't know.  Hey, Jay, I called you this morning at 11 o'clock and told you if you want to come down, just  page me.  But I told you that tomorrow wouldn't be a better day.  So that was at the tail end of the message.  The first part of the message was, Jay, it's Rick.  Look, today's not good. 
[69:00]
 Tomorrow, we got like Bedlam going on, et cetera, et cetera.  But today's, you know, today's not a really good day.  The last one's in the studio.  Opie said come back any time.  That's it.  Yeah.  But Rick took executive powers.  Opie said any time except today.  The only day you're available to come in just to have fun with the guys because you're a  fan of the show.  Today was your only day.  I'm trying to get a movie. 
[69:30]
 I'm trying to get movies here.  I don't know you got homeless stuff.  I'm a comic.  We don't know anything about homeless people.  You want to bust with those stinky bastards right now?  Yeah.  Ask them why they wear 15 winter coats in the summertime.  What is that?  I don't know, man.  Some of them are sleeping.  They're all like, I must see how much heat I can withstand. 
[70:00]
 Some of them are sleeping.  Don't they do enough that during the day?  Biggie's crashed out in the back.  Biggie?  I think he's taking movies.  Biggie.  What does that smell like right now?  But Jay, I was also trying to get your head for you today.  Hey Rick, what smells worse?  What smell is winning?  The homeless or your Jocard Noir clone?  I can't afford Jocard.  Oh yeah, you can't?  It's a Guido clone of choice. 
[70:30]
 Yeah, but I'm a spiky rat.  I'm a spiky rat.  You guys definitely got to fight next time you're together.  I think so, Fight Club.  Fight Club?  Yeah, Jay, if you start losing, trust me, there's a bunch of guys around here that will jump in and help you out.  I'll just bring some brothers down with me.  If the Puerto Rican gets on top of me, just, you know.  Hey, that ain't bad, man. He pulled my man's hair.  Jay, they killed you off in the last episode of your show.  How brilliant was that? Time of Death, 9th, Saturday, Thursday. 
[71:00]
 The stroke of brilliance.  And that bitch Jennifer Love Hewitt, they signed her up and keep her show going.  Her show got worse ratings than mine did.  I know.  What a wreck.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Cans won out, man.  I'm so happy you did not be on TV.  Really? You got to get Preston plants.  Why you happy?  Because I didn't realize how hard I worked until I had time off.  And then today I slept for two. I slept for four hours.  That's my guy.  I got two pornos, I got a couple Buttman videos. 
[71:30]
 I'm just like spraying the infield. That's all.  I just sit around.  You know when those guys come out like the 6th inning and they just hose down the infield?  Right, right.  And it starts to them blow away?  That's all you're doing.  That's all I do.  You didn't dump that, did you?  No, not at all.  I just sprayed the infield.  Hold on, Jay, let me get rid of Rick.  Rick, what are you firing him?  Hey Rick, Rick.  Yeah, what?  What's wrong?  I think we got a caravan of listeners following us right now.  Oh, awesome. 
[72:00]
 All right, very good.  Hey, all you listeners out there, if you get ahold of Rick, kick the crap out of him.  Wouldn't you rather be listening to me right now than Rick with a bunch of stinky people at Lodge in their underwear?  Everyone, kick, slash, or high beams.  Rick, Rick looks like the Italian guy at the mall.  He looks like he should be working at a merry-go-round.  Kick his ass.  Nice, Jay, love you.  You want to be Italian?  I got you a bottle of that, yeah. 
[72:30]
 Talk your horns if you can hear me.  All right, hey, Rick, hang up.  Goodbye.  God damn it.  We'll talk to you soon.  All right.  I have a $10 reward for anybody that kicks Rick in the nuts, but no death, please, no death.  No killing.  There will be no killing of Rick.  No.  Jay, you're funny, man.  It's a nice kick in his donkey balls.  You know he's got like a four-foot drop on those things.  It's like a Crown Royal bag with stones and nuts.  Crown Royal bag. 
[73:00]
 I can't believe I'm not sitting up there with my whole board.  I know.  What are you doing?  That jackass.  Jay, if you really liked us, you'd be here, man.  No.  I'm going to go with you right now, which is what I'm doing.  All right.  I got a doctor's appointment now.  Aw.  I got to go get my happy pills.  Very good.  Get your happy pills.  There you go.  Anthony is no stranger to the happy pills.  Come on.  Anthony takes his happy pills eight ounces at a time in those little red bottles of...  Try those pills.  That's my life.  Anthony takes wine out of a box.  No. 
[73:30]
 In his refrigerator, he gets a box of wine.  Yeah, I heard you guys had quite a night at the Paisanos.  That was fun, man.  It was a lot of fun.  We had a lot of stories.  Yeah.  I'm laughing my ass off.  We're talking about your days in Boston and about how the mayor died.  Yeah.  That was a good one.  And by coincidence, one of my best friends was the mayor's assistant at that time.  In Boston?  Yeah.  Chappie.  Kevin Chapman.  Very good.  Oops.  So what's going to happen if Rick...  Am I like an accessory to murder if somebody like puts a bullet in Rick's head right now? 
[74:00]
 Probably.  You know how lawyers are these days.  You could be tied to it.  Yeah.  So what are you guys doing tonight?  Are you just talking over there and going back to Rick's remote?  Yeah, it's great actually.  I mean, we got news crews all over the malls.  Everyone's freaking out.  You guys should have your own TV show.  I don't know what the problem is.  We're getting there.  We've got to have Jennifer Love Hewitt on it.  We've got to get those big jugs.  We need breast implants.  Jennifer Aniston's got big jugs too.  But now she lost them.  She lost all that weight.  But when I worked with her, she had jugs and a big fat ass that you want to put your face  in.  Oh, God, I hated her.  But now she lost them.  She lost all that weight.  She said to Ileana Douglas, they screen tested six guys and the one guy I hate they hire. 
[74:30]
 Wow.  What's the problem?  I don't know.  But I thought the movie turned out very well.  Yeah, she didn't like it.  She was very hot.  I had the extra like 30, 20 pounds on her and saw that big fat ass clean that starfish.

Uh-oh, the phone just crapped out.  We're losing the phone.  I'm surprised.  Hey, alright, we're losing his connection.  We'll get back to Rick in just a second here.  We can go to Cheryl, who's in the limo following the homeless bus.  Cheryl!  Hey, Cheryl!  Did we lose Cheryl?  Alright. 
[81:00]
 Yeah, we lost Cheryl.  Because what we have is a homeless bus.  Yeah.  Then we have the FM Talk van.  And then we have Cheryl and the gang in the limo.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Taking the nice vehicle.  Yes.  So, there you have it.  We are going to Short Hills Mall.  We'll be there in about 10 minutes, Anthony.  We get a Gucci scalp.  Eddie, what's going on?  Not much.  Alright.  Listen, man, I got a friend that works in Inveda. 
[81:30]
 It's like a cream store, like massage creams and all this crazy stuff.  And I want you guys to go in there.  You think they'll give one of the homeless guys a free massage?  Absolutely.  Alright, cool.  Have one of the homeless guys ask for a massage.  Alright.  You gotta go in Nordstrom.  Alright.  Alright, man.  That was great.  Thank you, Eddie.  Rick's back on the line.  Let's see if he has a better connection.  Rick?  Yeah.  Alright, what's up?  What's happening, guys? 
[82:00]
 Here's one of our less fortunate guys who's going to be shopping today.  Don, do you want to talk to the guys real quick?  Hey, Don.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Are you in a good mood today, Don?  Yeah, you know, except for this blindfold, man.  They put blindfolds on me.  I can't see where I'm going.  They put blindfolds on you guys?  Yeah.  Come on.  Yeah, man, I got my hands tied too, man.  He's holding the phone in my ear.  Okay, thank you, Don.  I have no idea where I'm going, you know.  You guys could be taking me to Cuba for all I know. 
[82:30]
 No, it's what it is.  We're going to give you $102 to spend any way you want in that fine mall.  Really?  Yeah, Short Hills Mall.  And a bunch of our faithful listeners are going to join you guys there, and I believe  they're going to give you change and stuff too, alright?  Okay, man.  Well, have fun, Don.

There's a welcoming committee there I'm hearing. 
[85:30]
 So let's go to the phone now and talk to Rick, who's on the homeless box.  All right.  Guys, we are here.  All right, Rick.  And we are on location at the Short Hills Mall, right in front of Houla Hands near Neiman  Marcus.  The staff of Houla Hands just came running out to greet us.  Oh, really?  We got a bunch of listeners with stamp out racism signs, help ONA stamp out hunger.  I mean, people are just here supporting this in grand scale.  We have more people pulling up. 
[86:00]
 Oh, look, security guards are running over.  All right.  That's why we have the ONA security detail talking to those guys right now.  Okay.  Are you ready for the guys to come off the bus?  They didn't even make it on the bus.  What security guys?  Hey, Rick, are they ready to leave the bus?  Yeah, in just about a moment, we're going to be bringing everybody off the bus and introduce  them to the wonderful world of shopping here at the Short Hills Mall.  Why don't you have each guy maybe say hi through the phone as they're walking off the bus, what 
[86:30]
 their name is and that, okay?  You can introduce them to the whole radio audience.  Ask what they think maybe they want to be buying in some of these stores.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Hold on a second.  Okay.  Here we go with the first guy.  What's your name again, sir?  Neil Armstrong.  Thomas, what do you think you're going to buy today when you get into the mall?  Usually soaping.  What is that?  All right.  Thomas isn't sure exactly because there's a lot of different stores to pick from.  I think he sees hooligans and realizes, they're all going to stop there. 
[87:00]
 They're not going any further than hooligans.  Did you have to park them in front of a bar?  Oh, he did.  It was the best place.  They had a welcoming committee.  What's your name again?  Gray Wolf.  It's Gray Wolf.  Oh, Gray Wolf.  Gray Wolf.  What are you going to be buying when you get in there?  Toys for my little girl and a present for my wife.  All right.  There you go.  All right.  You're going to be buying it from Gray Wolf.  Okay.  He's going to be buying some stuff for his kids and his wife.  All right.  Skilps.  What's your name? 
[87:30]
 Frankie.  Frankie, what are you buying?  I'm going to Tiffany's.  All right.  You heard it.  Frankie's going to Tiffany's.  He's going to go buy himself some nice jewelry.  That's okay.  What's your name, dude?  My name is Cory.  Cory, where are you going to go shopping first?  I just like to go shopping.  All right.  I just like to say it's good to be homeless today.  I'm going anywhere that has free gifts.  Oh, this is short and old.  You've got to bring this ad.  He's got a big coat is what he's saying.  Oh, man.  And what are you going to be shopping for? 
[88:00]
 Any store that will take my money.  You heard it from Ken.  Any store that's going to take his money.  We've got Jose next.  All right.  Jose.  Hey, Jose.  What are you going to buy?  Hey, Jose.  Talk with me.  What?  Huh?  Jose, close up.  Tequila.  Yeah, Jose is the guy that's hooked on tequila.  Hey, bro.  Who doesn't know how to make a margarita?  Come on up here.  I got to get you on the phone here.  Everybody, let's snoop up here for a second.  He's been hiding in the back there sleeping. 
[88:30]
 Snoop?  Snoop.  Snoop, what are you going to be buying today?  Whatever I can use for all your work.  All right.  All right.  And what else do you got in your pockets, mother, ever?  Exactly.  All right, we still got Don.  Don, what are you going to be buying today?  Well, if I can see anything where you take the blindfold off, I don't know.  I don't know.  I've got to look around.  All right.  A lot of window shopping.  And finally, Ziggy, get your ass up here. 
[89:00]
 All right, Ziggy.  Ziggy's awake and he's ready to shop.  Okay.  All right, Ziggy, what are you going to be buying today, sir?  I'm going to buy a foul.  You have to buy something here.  Yeah, you have to buy something.  I'm going to buy a cup of coffee.  All right, we're going to buy you a cup of coffee.  You're going to call me.  You're going to buy gifts.  Yeah.  Buy gifts, dude, like what?  Whatever you want.  You got anybody you want to buy for?  Well, I've got to see what's going to happen.  Yeah.  He's going to be doing some window shopping. 
[89:30]
 Dude, if he doesn't go to Armani and try on a suit, I'm going to be pissed.  I want a picture of him in an Armani suit.  Think about the poor guy that's got to measure his inseam.  And as I've been talking to all these guys, we've got about a hundred people now in front  of the mall.  All right.  As our welcoming committee, let's see how cars are going to go by.  Hey, everybody, open the doors. 
[90:00]
 All right.  It's in Bedlam, down in Shore Hills Mall.  Yeah.  Hey, look who's here.  Jay Borg has walked into the studio.  All right, they are here.  We're just about ready to exit the bus, man.  Head into the mall.  How you doing, man?  I don't know what else to say, man.  We're going to go shopping.  All right, man, we'll check in with you right after the rest of these commercials, Rick.  So hang tight.  You got it, dude. 
[90:30]
 All right, there he goes.  This bus has made it to the Shore Hills Mall, Anthony.  I can't wait till Ziggy's in that Armani suit, man.  Looking for a great Italian restaurant in the heart of Little Italy?  Well, you just found it.  Pizano of Mulberry Street.  You'll love Pizano.  Hey, it's my kind of restaurant.  Come try Pizano for that real Italian taste you want.  Your table's waiting, so stay a while. 
[91:00]
 Come taste the good life Italian style.  If you love the romance of Italy and incredible authentic Italian cuisine, you'll love Pizano of Mulberry Street.  Come by for our legendary pasta lunch specials or an unforgettable dinner with a wine list that goes on and on.  Ask for Joey Jr. and get a glass of wine on the house.  Pizano of Mulberry Street.  Call 965-1188.  That's 965-1188.  You'll love Pizano. 
[91:30]
 You'll love Pizano.  Hey, it's my kind of restaurant.  All right, this is FM Talk, the 1027 Talk.  You can't ignore it.  It's Opie and Anthony and our buddy, our pal, Jay Moore.  Oh, look out!  Where's Marco?  Call up Marco.  You got another load of baby batter in you?  Marco, I have another load of baby batter ready to go.  People couldn't believe that.  I thought you were actually gay. 
[92:00]
 I thought you were a gay guy.  No, how much money you got?  It depends on how much money you got.  Between that and your love for the middle Hanson child.  Oh, that kid's hot.  You're going to tell me that kid's not hot?  People not really know it.  You know how hard it is to get a cab in Manhattan at 430?  I stole a bike to get here.  Well, we appreciate that, Jay.  I stole a bike with one of them old-fashioned chains at the combination lock.  I was like, I get this.  The Asian bicycle delivery guy.  I went to junior high.  So I got some Chinese food here. 
[92:30]
 You got some sauce on the front.  You kicked the Chinese guy off his bike to get here.  I like these cabs.  They got bulletproof glass between you and the driver.  Glass that'll stop a bullet.  But somehow it doesn't stop that smell from making it.  You guys are like, where do you want to go?  I'm like, upwind.  Why don't you take me to the river and you can swim to Giant Stadium in the back.  It's nice that you got the heat on in a wool suit.  What do you like? Dressing up for your job?  All I see is the back of your head and your right arm. 
[93:00]
 You should wear a bathing suit and some speed sticks.  Stinky bastard.  I want Jim Brewer.  Hey, if anybody's out there going to see comedy, make sure you go see Jim Brewer.  Look at you plugging Jim.  Because I feel bad that Jim's mad at me because of that show in Boston.  That's what it was though.  Why did everybody in school wear a rubber band?  It was nothing from SNL or anything.  All right. Hold that thought, Jim.  Rick, what's up?  We're bringing the guys off the bus.  They're chanting for Ziggy. 
[93:30]
 Ziggy is the little fat homeless guy who smells so bad.  The most pathetic of the homeless.  I didn't know.  They couldn't broadcast.  I wish we were.  They didn't have any broadcast facilities for us at the short-lived mall.  All right. Coming up now.  Here we go.  Our next guy is Frankie number what number? 
[94:00]
 Number one.  Oh, we put numbers on them.  Number zero.  They all have their homeless shirts on.  Zero, double zero, triple zero.  All right. Up next.  Number two is Jose.  Jose is hooked on tequila, we find out today.  Loves his tequila.  Who is he home with?  All right, everybody here.  Ten, number eight.  Who's cheering, the fans?  Yeah.  A bunch of our listeners are down there.  You guys should have hired Bob Shepard from the Yankee band. 
[94:30]
 Number seven.  Number seven, Bob.  We got Keith, number four.  Wow.  Loving the engine.  And finally we got Snoop with no number.  He's just running on it.  They love Snoop.  Look at the picture they took.  Lippy Dolph.  Lippy Dolph.  Rick.  Very good, Rick. 
[95:00]
 All right, guys.  We are just about ready to jump in here.  We got to get in the mall now because they're going to arrest us.  We're causing too many problems here.  Hurry up, get in there.  How many people are around?  It's up to, it's probably about 150, close to 200 now.  We got a lot of homeless people coming out of the mall to greet us.  We got like five security guards now with their trucks.  We would like to rent a homeless person.  We got guys wanting to rent homeless people, to help them chaperone and get them shopping.  Hey Rick, make sure Ziggy tries on some shoes as well with that nice suit. 
[95:30]
 Oh my God.  Hey Ziggy, Nordstrom is good for shoes.  You want to try there?  Nordstrom, shoes.  Good?  I don't know, I got shoes on.  He got his shoes on.  That's all he needs.  He's had the same shoes since 75.  Why does he care?  The traffic is all the way back to the highway.  What's wrong, Rick?  We got the state police to move it up because we're backing the traffic to the highway.  Get in the mall, get in the mall, run.  Yeah, get in the mall.  Get in the mall.  Get in the mall, guys.  We'll talk to you in a minute.  Alright, cool. 
[96:00]
 Don't walk, run.  Bye, there they go.  Everybody.  Really, they'll be turned away.  Oh my God.  It's Bedlam.  We have a few listeners, Jay.  Alright.  Oh my God.  The homeless shopping spree is off to a fine start, Anthony.  That is fantastic.  And you know what's great?  It's a write-off for you guys.  You didn't talk about it.  You guys can get some nice leather jackets and stuff.  You can write it off.  You can get it on the show.  I'm talking about my act.  I'm talking about my Rolex for 10 minutes. 
[96:30]
 You can write it off.  Let me tell you something about the people at Rolex.  It's professional.  I have to do it.  Oh, we're very excited.  The phones are just going nuts.  Man, also the listeners that are going to be following them through the mall.  That's just going to be like, what is he saying?  I wonder if Rick got kicked in the nuts at all.  Somebody will do it.  Hey, look, it's for Jay Moore.  Let's talk to Mush real fast.  Mush, you work at Short Hills Mall?  No, I don't work at Short Hills Mall, but I do some services once in a while.  I'm not saying exactly what I do for the sake of my job, but they are the most stuck-up people in the world. 
[97:00]
 That's why we picked Short Hills Mall.  I had a call up there one day to see what their problem was.  They just had the name of the business.  It didn't say they were in the Short Hills Mall or anything like that.  So I call them up and I'm talking to them.  I was like, yeah, just to make sure before I get out there, you're in the Short Hills Mall, right?  He goes, no, sir, we're in the mall at Short Hills.  I was like, well, have a good day because I'm not coming out. 
[97:30]
 All right, we picked the perfect mall then.  I hope they have a good day.  I have a few friends that work there as well.  Have them stop at Bloomingdale in the perfume department.  These guys need to be sprayed down so that's not a bad idea.  All right, thank you.  They should bottle that homeless smell and sell that.  Uh-oh, I'd sample that.  What chair are you sitting on, Jay?  I don't know.  I swear to God.  Is that the chair that Viggy was sitting in?  Is that the chair over there?  We sprayed it down a light bulb. 
[98:00]
 Why?  It just dawned on you that I might be sitting in a chair that is like, uh...  You don't understand what was sitting in that chair.  Viggy Cyril.  I'm so freaking bad.  Like we're taking that chair out of the building with us tonight.  We're just leaving it there.  Have it laminated.  Hey, I listened.  I was driving from upstate New York, Delhi, all the way down here and I listened when you guys had those two chick cops in and that was some of the best radio.  Oh, it beat the crap out of us, man.  Yeah, but Anthony was an animal.  I was trying.  I was listening to Russ show. 
[98:30]
 Yeah, I was a puss.  I was really trying.  What would happen if you just turned around and punched him in the face?  You know what?  They would beat the living crap out of you.  I was hurting, man.  They get that one cuff on you and then twist it so it's working like a ratchet on your wrist.  I was in pain.  Finally you just say, alright, I give.  I give.  I know, Rick had a bloody nose.  I heard Rick was a pit bull.  Yeah, Rick was really tearing him up.  He started bleeding. 
[99:00]
 He had a bloody nose from having his balls grabbed.  What kind of wiring does he have?  That's a weird wiring job, man.  I can understand it running a little.  It was a wild show though.  Grab my balls, watch my nose bleed.  I'm a weirdo.  Jim, real fast, what do you have, man?  Yeah, I left work early today because I knew you guys were going by the Short Hills Mall and I got to go by there on my commute.  You could just see the cars backing up into the entrance of the mall.  Oh, cool. 
[99:30]
 The bus was there and I called my wife and said, I'm coming home early because I'm not getting stuck in that crap.  But I'll tell you, the one guy who called up was all because I live in a town next to the mall.  The guy said, we thought it was so great, these guys coming out to the rich suburban territory.  Tomorrow they're going home, tomorrow we're still rich.  In that guy's face.  Yeah, way to scoreboard for you.  You're homeless and I'm rich.  What a nice guy. 
[100:00]
 Yeah, well tomorrow I'll still be rich and white and afraid of blacks in Puerto Rico.  And I'll live in my little gated community and you'll still be homeless.  Jokes on you, homeless guy.  You showed him.  Scoreboard, rich guy one, homeless guy nothing.  You have the homeless guys on the radio.  All right, hold on.  I'm not going there. Marco's on the line. 
[100:30]
 Oh, look at that.  Let me talk to Mike real fast. Mike, what's up? Real fast.  What's up, fellas?  My wife and I make about $150,000.  We went to the short hills with my son and they were looking at us like we were trash.  Oh, really?  Screw them all.  Mike, what color are you?  I'm white.  Oh, you sound like a black guy.  All right, all right. That's a point, Jim.  All right, man. Thank you.  All right, you guys rock.  He's kind of like a brother, isn't he? 
[101:00]
 Mark, you know I went down to Short Hills Mall.  Right.  You know what I'm saying?  Let's check in with Psycho Mark who's at Short Hills Mall as well. Psycho Mark.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  We're in Newman Marcus right now with some of the boys and we're shopping around.  This is some fine gifts for Christmas.  Newman Marcus.  Can I tell you, they welcomed us here at the mall.  The head guy from security said that we're entirely welcome here at the Short Hills Mall. 
[101:30]
 Yeah, really.  We're able to shop so everyone's welcome and happy and the guys are very happy.  Okay.  What are you guys looking for? Anything in particular?  Not really. Just to see what the best value is around here.  Value?  I don't know who he's going to get for it.  Who is it? DK?  Best value.  You want to supersize that for 33 cents extra?  The crowd was unbelievable outside.  Yeah. They're not following you around in the mall right now?  Yeah, we've got a small crowd following us around. 
[102:00]
 There's mostly people staring at us.  None of the salespeople have come to help us.  Yeah, none of the salespeople.  They don't want to help?  I don't understand what might be.  Psycho Mark, who are you with right now?  What you guys are getting?  Okay.  I've got Jose.  And I've got Kent with me.  Well, have him just start trying on jackets and stuff.  Hey, why don't you guys start trying on some nice stuff?  Do you just want to try on a nice shirt?  I think that looks awesome. 
[102:30]
 We've got some Tommy Bahama shirts over here.  They look really nice.  I think you guys look good.  Definitely try something on because I think there's not enough people staring at us.  Oh, here's a salesperson over here.  We have some great shirts, you said?  And what's your name?  Simon.  We've got Simon here.  Simon.  My name is Simon.  And yeah, if you wouldn't mind coming and helping some of these salesmen, that'd be great. 
[103:00]
 Well, what would you try on one of these nice shirts?  I think that's gorgeous.  I think that would look fabulous.  Jose's trying on a shirt right now.  Jose's trying on a shirt right now.  I think they need a pretty big shirt.  For a homeless guy, he's pretty fat.  Hey, Mark, make sure they remove the clothes.  Hold on.  Hey, Mark, Jay has something for you.  Jay Moore.  This is a technicality.  Make sure they remove the clothing they have on before they try on the new clothing. 
[103:30]
 Don't just layer them up.  Don't make them dress in layers.  Get them naked.  I want to see homeless titties.  You said Jose's fat.  That's something I don't understand.  How could homeless people be fat?  They're freaking homeless.  Ever see the homeless guys in the park with muscles?  How do they get muscle if they're homeless?  I go to the gym every day.  I can never break 160.  I'm 160 pounds my whole life.  I see a homeless guy who's all ripped up.  How much does that cardboard box weigh? 
[104:00]
 He's working it, man.  He's shopping.  What's the problem?  He's looking for another store.  Neiman Marcus is a little too snooty for his taste.  Well, one of the homeless guys walked out of Neiman Marcus?  I've had it.  With six Donna Caron suits under his jacket.  I shan't shop here again.  Dude, we are getting stared at.  You would not believe the stares we are getting.  Mark, don't think about how we get more. 
[104:30]
 Hey, Mark, why don't you talk to one of the snooty people and ask them what they're staring at?  Yeah, exactly.  Excuse me, ma'am, have you ever seen any homeless people like this shopping in a mall before?  No.  Never? Are you from New Jersey?  Yes.  What do you think about homeless people shopping in Neiman Marcus?  It's good for them.  It's good for them? She likes it.  So there you go.  She's very happy.  We'll check in a little bit.  We're going to go to another store and see if we can stir up a little bit more of snootiness.  Go find Santa Claus, man. 
[105:00]
 You've got to get some of these guys sitting on Santa's lap, right?  Alright, guys, we'll check back in.  Alright, man.  I hope you guys have some video done.  Oh, we're having a guy videotaping the whole thing.  Oh, man.  Actually, Comedy Central wants this.  You have to have it.  We've got like two video cameras rolling.  Alright, listen, we've got to take a quick break.  Do you want to talk to Marco again, your gay lover?  He's on Line 10.  You know what? I think the listeners want me to talk to Marco again.  That's all I hear about.  Alright, Mark goes up next with Jay Moore. 
[105:30]
 Anthony, lots of crap going on today.  We've got Jay Moore in the studio as well who was eating at Paesano's last night, right, Jay?  I come out of the bathroom at Paesano's and this girl comes up to me and goes,  will you do me a favor?  I go, yeah.  She says, my friend just got here from Israel.  She thinks you're Jay Moore.  Will you go over and say hi?  Just tell her you are.  I go, alright.  She goes, do you get that a lot?  I go, once in a while, my brother gets it a lot.  I go, I have a twin brother that looks more like him than I do. 
[106:00]
 I go, how are you doing? I'm Jay Moore.  She goes, hi.  I go, she goes, I really like to show action.  I go, I'm going to do it in Germany.  We're like number one in England and Germany.  Great.  No, it is great. It means I get more money.  Oh really? But you can't do a new episode.  Yeah, that's right.  You think anyone else will pick up the show?  I hope not. I'm done.  You don't want to do it now?  No, we made 13, like gangsters, 13, making a tellable mark on the landscape and you ride off into the sunset.  No one did a better show than that. 
[106:30]
 Peace, we're out of here.  Cool. Yeah, that was good.  What are you doing, movies now?  I'm acting.  Come on, get out of here.  You don't think that will affect your career?  I'm going to have to be like an actor on a Seymour Butts home porno.  You better stop hanging out with us.  That would be like, I bet I would get a million dollars if I did a porno.  You probably would. Why don't you do it?  Just for a goof.  You know, I would totally do porno, but you know there's variables like AIDS, and then there's AIDS, and then there's AIDS. 
[107:00]
 Alright, you want to check in with Psycho Mark again? You want to talk to one of the snooty people at the Short Hills Mall, right?  Psycho Mark's doing a good job.  He's great.  Today's not a good day, Jay. We have a lot going on.  Yeah, really?  Obey and Hinton is on me anytime. I thought I was a friend of the show. Yeah, but not today.  From now on, you just show up, alright?  He's your producer.  We don't even want to know when you're coming. 
[107:30]
 You just show up and it'll be a nice surprise.  All the time we're talking, it's like, hey, look, it's Jay Wall.  Psycho Mark at Short Hills Mall. Psycho Mark, what's going on?  We just went into Versace and you could have seen the faces. They thought we were a Martian stepping off a spaceship.  It was unbelievable. We have a crowd of, got to be, at least three or four hundred people following us all around.  They have never seen anything like it in the entire... and it is just unbelievable. People are just absolutely shocked. 
[108:00]
 Are a lot of pictures and video being taken for the website?  No, I'm taking a ton of pictures. Some great pictures. Actually, we're not allowed to take pictures in the mall, but we're sneaking a few of them here and there.  This isn't a museum. No flash photography.  We should see some of the snobby people here. They cannot believe that we are actually here.  Well, listen, you've got to find a snobby person because Jay Moore wants to talk to them.  Alright, hold on. We'll see if we can find a snobby person.  And remember, no flash photography during the dramatic Orange Julius section. 
[108:30]
 Hold on, we're trying to...  The mall at Short Hills.  Everyone keeps walking away from me. I'm like, I have a disease.  Alright, you do.  Mark, I'll check in with you in a sec. We've got Rick on the other line, man.  Alright.  There's a ton of people with cell phones in the Short Hills mall. They're all following Ziggy around. You want to talk to one of them real fast?  Oh, yeah.  And then we'll go to Rick. Rick, hold on a sec. Brandon, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on? I'm following Ziggy right now.  Yeah? What is he doing with his money? 
[109:00]
 Him and Gray Wolf just went into a card shop and they were buying cards.  Buying cards, huh?  Like birthday cards?  Like birthday cards?  I don't know. I couldn't get close enough, man. There's a crowd and a half behind them.  Yeah, that's what everyone's saying.  Alright, thank you, Brandon.  Alright, another guy following Ziggy. George, what's going on?  Oh, what's up? I want to say hello to Anthony!  You're on the air. What's up?  Oh my God.  That's so cool, man. It's crazy. Mothers are grabbing their kids. It's ridiculous, man. 
[109:30]
 We have taken over Short Hills mall, man.  We should have went, man.  The revolution! We're going to revolution!  Get us a helicopter. We want to get to Short Hills mall immediately.  God, we should have went, man.  I know.  There's so many people here. There's about four. There's like 300 people here. All following these guys around.  Right.  There's like all these snobby people that are like walking around, like looking all over.  Like, what the hell is going on? What's going on here?  They have no idea what's going on. They keep losing Ziggy. Ziggy keeps wandering off all over the place. 
[110:00]
 Look at Rick right here. He's right next to me. I'm on right now.  Hey, Rick. Get Ziggy the phone.  So, yeah, we're in a split locker, I think.  Oh, are you?  Just walking around.  Mad people all over the place.  Well, get Ziggy to try on some snakes, man.  Where's Ziggy? Ziggy!  He's on the phone. I want to talk to him real fast.  Look at the guys wandering from shop to shop.  Ziggy, stay on Open ANTY.  Yeah, Anty has the same name as me, Ziggy. 
[110:30]
 Yeah?  He's got a couple of coffees.  You want to talk to Snoop?  Yeah, let's talk to Snoop. Ziggy's hard to keep on the phone.  Snoop's a white guy.  Snoop! Open ANTY, want to talk to you.  Yo, yo, yo, boy. Hey, what's going on? What's going on?  Hey, Snoop, have you bought anything yet?  What's the best tea in the world?  Donation!  That's right.  All right, thank you, George. Let's go to Rick.  Rick, what's going on, buddy? 
[111:00]
 We're in Foot Locker, as you know.  And we just had our first two purchases.  Okay.  The chief picked up a nice carousel, Christmas carousel,  that he got from the Carlton Cars book store.  And also Snoop picked up something for his mom.  What did he get for his mom?  He got a nice heart-shaped thing, a glass thing.  It's pretty nice. I don't know what it's called, but it's pretty cool.  How can you be homeless with a mom?  That you would buy a present for?  Yeah, because you can't sleep on her couch. 
[111:30]
 You know how many bridges you have to burn to become homeless?  Then he's on four consecutive holidays.  You came home, took a dump in the fish tank, and had sex with your father.  I mean, that's what you've got to do.  Where you go like, hey, I'm homeless. Can I crash?  No! Don't ever come here!  Hey, how do you guys like that?  You like that? You want that?  Oh, man, you're hilarious.  Hey, Rick. Yeah?  Is it true you guys got like 300 or 400 people following you?  Yeah, it's real difficult to try and keep these guys in line 
[112:00]
 because everybody's running off offering them money.  Offering them money?  We're hoping they get lost, man.  That number's going to double. Huh?  Oh, we've got one guy who's going to try on a nice jacket here, a footlocker.  But he's got to take his shirt off to try the jacket.  Rick, what you need to do is get Ziggy in a seat and have him try on some fine Nike's.  All right, yeah, he's just hulking around with the shoes trying to figure out which ones he likes.  Okay.  So, let's see. He's kind of pondering in a couple of shoes there. 
[112:30]
 All right.  Hold on, he's looking at a pair of Nike's.  He's just brought some British Nights up the rack.  Hey, Zig, what are you looking at here, man?  I've been selling shoes.  You've been selling new shoes?  No, it's no good.  Anything smells good.  Imagine what his smell like.  You don't want shoes, dude?  No, I don't need any.  No, come on, try on a pair. You like these? They're going to be free.  They're going to be free.  What size are you? 
[113:00]
 People are offering to buy things for him, I guess.  I don't know, Mary, no, it's changes depending on the size.  All right, if you get the shoe size, it depends on how many stuff you're stuffing in there.  I can't even understand.  All right, we've got a sales guy over here.  What size are you?  Hold on, let me go. Yeah, we're going to go see sales.  Make sure he takes his socks off to try on new socks and shoes.  You've got to get body parts out in the open so these guys can really stink.  A bare, sweaty, stinky skin.  That guy's feet are so ashy, it looks like he's been kicking flour. 
[113:30]
 Ryan, I need a pair of shoes here for Ziggy.  Hold on.  Let's see. I think we need a size six or a size seven.  That's small.  What? What are they, a midget?  Nine and a half is your small. You got anything in a six and a half in black?  No, get him a nine and a half. He has enough layers of socks.  He's got to be able to shove more socks and some newspapers in there.  Try seven and a half or eight.  How small are this guy's feet? How did that happen? 
[114:00]
 He looked like a little fidget guy.  He's a little guy, yeah.  We're getting him a pair of shoes to try on.  A lot of people are here. They're totally cool, man, here at Short Hills.  The guys, people are offering to buy themselves so they can save some cash and buy some other stuff later.  Hey Rick, it's Jay. How much money did you pocket so far?  I'll give it to him.  Give it to me. I'll give it to him.  Jerk off.  I can't wait for the fight club between Jay Moore and Rick.  It'll happen. 
[114:30]
 Okay, Frank's got a pair here.  Rick's got a pair here.  He's got a pair of running shoes.  Yeah, Rick, the socks gotta come off.  It's been a long time since I've been shopping too.  Yeah, I can imagine.  The socks lifted.  But he's running down the street with a TV.  Is he going to try the shoes on or what?  Yeah, he's going to try the shoes on, right?  But the socks gotta come off.  He's got a box in hand. He's going to try them on right now.  The socks have to come off.  How'd they fit?  They fit great, man. This is great. I love this. 
[115:00]
 Alright, very good.  Alright, guys, you heard it. We're here at Foot Locker at the Short Hills Mall.  We've got about 300 people outside the store.  Alright, you gotta find Santa, man.  Alright, we're going to go to Santa. Plus, we've got an offer for Mrs. Field's cookies.  They're going to give us like 25% off all their cookies.  Very nice.  Cool.  Hey Rick, get a bunch of the guys into Macy's and let the girls spray them down with some perfume and stuff.  Oh yeah, makeover for next.  Alright, cool. 
[115:30]
 Alright, man.  It's going quite well, our homeless shopping spree, Anthony.  I love the generosity just pouring out from the people.  At the Short Hills Mall.  I think Spaz farted behind you because he's waving it off.  What the hell, Spaz?  It stinks enough in here.  Ah, Spaz, man, in the office after the show yesterday.  He's sitting there. He's just blasting farts out.  What do you think? People enjoy the smell of your ass?  Dude, come on.  Speaking of enjoying the smell of an ass, let's talk to Marco.  Alright, man ass.  We have time. Yeah, we have time. Screw it. 
[116:00]
 Marco.  Hold on.  Marco.  Jay.  Hi baby.  Hello?  Yeah, Marco, it's Jay. How you been, baby?  He's been canceled, honey.  That's it? I'm like nervous talking to you again.  You're nervous? Where are you now?  I'm just sitting in a car. I'm late for work actually.  They put me on hold for a while.  You're going to be a little later when you pull over to the side of the road and take your hog out.  I already took it out. 
[116:30]
 You already took it out?  Yeah. What's it look like? Are you circumcised?  Yeah, I'm circumcised.  How long? How big is it?  It's good. Six inches.  What do you measure from the asshole?  Jay, last time was amazing.  It was amazing.  Do it to me again.  No, you do it to me, honey.  You want me to do it to you? I watched a porn the other night.  I'm still a pimp or something like that.  Yeah, that's my porn name.  And you made it pretend it was me? 
[117:00]
 Yeah. How's Opie's ass today?  Easy, Marco. Keep me out of this one.  Marco, why are you going there?  That's a nice pork-sort Opie.  Easy. That's one way to get off the air, Marco.  Marco, if you want to stay in the air, I don't want you floating around with eyes for other men.  I want eyes only for my ass.  The air in my ass?  Did you say Marco?  I knew it wasn't Marco. It sounded like an Italian guy.  It didn't sound like the same love. 
[117:30]
 That's right, though. The real Marco we'll call it.  All right, we got to take a quick break.  That was disappointing. I was getting excited.  You could tell right from the beginning, though, he didn't sound like the same guy.  Well, at first he sounded scared, like, oh my God.  I got through.  Then I got the Italian accent coming through. Marco was like Puerto Rican or something.  Look at this pack guy from Brooklyn. That isn't Marco. He knew right away.  You know, that's Marco's lover.  He's preoccupied.  I'm with Marco now. I got it too fast.  Ziggy, it's Marco. 
[118:00]
 We're back at the Short Hill tomorrow.  Psycho Mark. Yeah, what's up, guys?  What's up?  We're in here shopping for shoes, and Ziggy is just causing a major disturbance in here.  He's got a coat on, he's got a brand new hat, and he's trying on some shoes.  It's just an absolute scream.  There's got to be 150, 200 people jammed in this door here.  At least.  At least.  I just got chipped off. There's a candy store right across from the shoe store.  The girl said if we walk over there, she's going to physically throw us all out. 
[118:30]
 Oh, really?  Yeah, so I'm trying to run up a couple of them so I can go for candy.  Hey, Mark. Hey, Mark.  Yes?  This is Jay.  You have a constitutional right to walk wherever you damn well please.  Absolutely.  What'd you say?  You have a constitutional right to walk wherever you damn well please.  I have a constitutional right to go buy candy if we want to.  So why don't you buy the candy right now while we're on the air, man? 
[119:00]
 Alright, hold on. Hey, guys, let's go candy shopping.  There it is. Come on.  We really need him.  Grab Ziggy.  Ziggy's still shopping.  Ziggy needs some kind of mint candy under his armpit.  Peppermint baddie, I mean.  Peppermint baddie.  Come on, let's go into the candy store.  You're a peppermint baddie. My diabetes gets in.  There's thousands of people here. It is absolutely...  Hey, you guys, listen. Hope you're into it. 
[119:30]
 Yeah!  It's absolutely madness. Absolutely madness.  Hey, Mark. Mark.  On your way to the candy store, get everybody candy.  Candy, candy, candy.  Hey, if you're all starting yelling, candy.  Candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy.  Oh, I'm getting a little familiar with the candy store.  Good.  She is not happy. 
[120:00]
 Can we come over and shop in here?  Oh, wait a minute.  She's not very happy.  Here comes the boys.  Candy.  Hey, Mark, get the candy lady on the phone.  All right, hold on a second.  There she goes.  We've got to get them chanting candy.  Can we talk to you for a second?  Yeah.  All right, hold on. Here she is. What's your name?  Peter.  Now, what do you think about the homeless people shopping in the store here?  Nothing wrong with it. No problem. 
[120:30]
 Good answer.  I know there's a rumor that they didn't want us in the candy store, but that's not true?  No, that's not true at all.  More than welcome to come in. They're people. Everybody's a person.  Hey, Mark.  Well, there you go. What's that, guys?  Mark, let Jay Moore talk to the fine candy lady.  All right, hold on. Do you want to speak to Jay Moore? He's a famous fellow.  Hello.  What's your name, miss?  Amy.  Amy, we heard that you were going to physically throw out everybody from the candy store if they went over there.  Not the people involved, but if 500 people come in here, we don't have the capacity for 500 people. 
[121:00]
 How are you going to throw out 500 people?  Are you a sumo wrestler? How are you going to throw out 500 people?  That's not the point.  No, the point is 500 people. You should be happy for the baby.  They will not fit in my store.  Hey, this is Opie and Anthony, baby. You watch. They'll fit themselves in that store.  Don't get on the wrong side of Opie and Anthony. They'll wedge themselves in there like those kids in the phone booths in the 50s.  Amy, you sound like a sensible gal.  I try.  You got candy canes, right? 
[121:30]
 Yes.  Just start throwing them out to the masses.  Throw them out to the masses?  Amy, how old are you?  28.  Do you have a triangle or a mohawk?  Oh my God.  Come on, answer the question. Triangle, mohawk or Abraham Lincoln?  Oh my God.  Come on, honey.  Oh my God.  Come on, baby.  I can't believe I'm attracted to you and I never even saw you before.  No, you wouldn't be, trust me.  I'm not into the candy store. I should probably dip into the process, you know what I mean? 
[122:00]
 No, no.  Triangular or mohawk?  Triangular or mohawk?  Well, maybe you've got to get a little triangle going and that'll help your...  Ha ha ha.  Triangular or mohawk?  Hey, don't get high on your own supply.  She's doing over there in the candy store.  Are you overweight? Is that what you're talking about?  I don't want to talk to you anymore.  She probably is. Hey, Mark?  Yeah.  Is he a heifer?  He has a mustache.  Alright, Mark. 
[122:30]
 We'll check in with you soon, alright?  Triangle, mohawk or mustache?  You left that one out.  Let's check in with Ben real fast. He's at another section of the mall.  Ben, what's going on?  We have like three cell phones going on.  Team reporting.  Ben, oh, now he's on this line.  You've got to get guys in the hell...  I'm outside Chardale's Mall and I'm looking down on the parking lot.  Oh, we're going down.  Hey, Ben.  Yeah, what's up?  We got some candy out of the candy shop.  We're looking to get a Walkman here. 
[123:00]
 None of our listeners come through this mall, so nobody knows where we can get a Walkman.  Oh, really?  When are we going to Macy's to get the perfume?  We need you guys to go to Macy's to get the perfume, man.  Macy's? Okay, we'll go to Macy's.  To get the free perfume and stuff, you know?  Yeah, we did that in Versace.  We went into Versace and got some cologne on us.  So we'll make our way to Macy's and we'll give you a call.  Ben, how crazy is it at that mall right now?  It's so crazy.  We've got a few hundred people with us right now. 
[123:30]
 You want me to have them screen in the front?  Yeah, why not?  We've got security trying to move us here.  Oh, I like it.  Ushering you along.  You have a constitutional right to stand there.  It's a peaceful assembly.  They're just trying to break the spur of the crowd.  We literally have the whole hall blocked.  I mean, you can't get down the hall.  There's so many people following us all around.  So we're going to head towards Macy's, wherever Macy's is.  And I've got our guys.  We'll call you back.  Hold on one sec. 
[124:00]
 Ben, whenever you go, you have to get the crowd to chant about the place you're going.  If you're going to Macy's, you've got to get all 300 people walking going, Macy's, Macy's.  All right, we'll do that.  Let's chant Macy's, guys, because we're heading to Macy's, right?  Macy's, Macy's, Macy's, Macy's, Macy's, Macy's, Macy's.  How's that, James?  I love it.  All right, thanks, Ben.  See you later.  Some guy is going to write about this in his class. 
[124:30]
 Dennis, what's going on?  Hey, how are you doing?  I'm out here with LB and Anthony.  Yeah, listen, fellas, I've got to applaud you.  I teach consumer behavior and marketing at a northern New Jersey upper-crust college.  And I've got students in my class that walk around with their pinkies extended all the time.  This is the best thing I have ever seen done to support what Thomas Jefferson said that we're all created equal.  All right.  I've got to compliment you guys, and I'm going to drill it into my people in class and let them know that you guys have done a real public service for society.  All right, thank you, Dennis. 
[125:00]
 Thomas Jefferson said that all people are created equal and go to the barn and have sex with a slave.  That was the second half of that quote.  And let me get some of that black tail.  The black man will ring the bell.  There you go, Zerl.  All right, you guys want to check in with the Justice Department?  Make sure everything's on the up and up.  Juliana?  Hello.  What's up?  I am quite teed off, actually.  Why?  Just because I think it is so unfair that there's actually troopers out there looking for you guys to stop this. 
[125:30]
 Nah, they've been pretty cool.  Well, and at any time.  Wait, wait, wait, I do have to stop you.  I got to tell you, man, all the cops and the troopers have been nothing but cool so far.  Yeah.  If you guys go in any store and they ask you to leave, I am fully prepared to back you guys up.  Look at these people.  Am I wrong or right?  You have a constitutional right, it's peaceful assembly.  It is the Civil Rights Act of 1973 and they have to serve you no matter of race, color, religion. 
[126:00]
 I hate that act.  Why do you hate that act?  No, no, no, there are some places I want to go and not be bothered by certain types.  I want to be there when you guys do your remote from Harlem.  We are going to do that.  I'll be there.  All right, Juliana, we'll keep close to the show.  We might need you from time to time, all right?  I am because it's, you know, I mean just because people are doctors, attorneys or whatever, doesn't mean we don't have a sense of humor. 
[126:30]
 All right, good.  And you know, just because, I mean, everybody exploits somebody.  I mean, if you watch a talk show or whatever, you know, there's people exploited on that.  And I mean, you guys are doing a good thing personally, I think.  Well, all right, thank you, Juliana.  Okay, take care.  We'll talk to you soon.  Thanks a lot.  Let's check in with Psycho Mark one more time here.  Psycho Mark.  Yeah, I'm in Macy's right now.  Really, really pissed off lady to see at the makeup counter.  Oh, really? 
[127:00]
 She's not happy.  Let's talk to her.  Let's talk to her.  J. Moore is really good at smoothing things over.  J's great at smoothing things over.  We're just trying to find, guys, this is unbelievable.  People are just absolutely amazed.  We are at Short Hills Mall, just in case you're out to it again.  That's where the homeless bus stopped today.  And you should stop by.  That's right.  It's not too late.  We'll be there for at least another hour.  Say hello.  There's plenty of room. 
[127:30]
 I'm going to have to call you guys back.  I can't seem to find her.  I'll call you right back.  I'll make a little makeover.  Brian is somewhere at Short Hills Mall.  Hey, what's up?  What's going on?  Oh, man, this is nuts out here, dude.  Really?  Yeah, I wanted to call up, see if you can get Rick to take him into Louis Vuitton.  The woman just walked up the stairs past me and my buddy Anthony.  And she's pissed.  She's screaming and yelling.  She's like, I don't want these f'ing people up here. 
[128:00]
 There's like a hundred people outside.  I don't want it.  This is nuts.  I'm going to call here and ask them.  And if they come in here, I'll throw them out.  And then when you confront them and talk to them, oh, no, they are all welcome.  They read off the same script.  Everyone is welcome.  We are fine with anyone you want to bring in.  When we walked in, this woman was like, what's going on?  What's going on?  And my buddy Anthony goes, oh, it's from a radio show.  They're bringing homeless people in.  They gave him a hundred bucks to shop. 
[128:30]
 The woman looks him dead in the face and goes, and they brought him here?  I think it's hilarious that all our listeners are in the mall with just cell phones all over the damn place.  Team coverage on the Open Anthony show.  Everyone is family with you guys.  Hell yeah.  This is the best show I've ever heard of in my life.  Thank you, Jay.  Jay Moore, our only Hollywood friend.  I know.  I have nothing to plug.  I have no dates.  Next time we are in LA, would you show us around?  Are we on that level yet?  Oh, absolutely. 
[129:00]
 We'll do a remote from my house.  Have some of my wife's hot friends come by.  That could be cool.  Can we bring some of our homeless friends?  No.  Stay at your house?  I don't believe in that amendment that lady brought in.  I don't want a bunch of freaky people in my house.  I got a Rottweiler, so she'll sniff him out for me.  I won't even have to get off the couch.  The dog will be like, you're out, you're out.  She'll sniff Anthony.  Anthony might not make it in.  Anthony might have a weird smell too. 
[129:30]
 The dog might get rid of Anthony.  Oh, man.  I want to keep taking breaks, but these guys are checking in like crazy.  Psycho Mark, do you have anything else to report?  Yeah, I'm right.  You know, it's really funny, but cell phones seem to work perfectly inside this mall.  But anywhere else you go in the goddamn state, they don't work.  Yeah.  But anyhow, I have a woman here at the...  Man, what do you think about what's going on outside?  Would you like to speak to Jay Moore on the phone?  He wants to talk to you.  You don't want to talk at all?  No comment.  No comment whatsoever.

Jay Moore wants to speak to you.  You don't want to talk to him?  Alright, well, I'll tell him he wants to talk to Tom Cruise in a movie.  I'm sure he'll scream.  Ask her when was your last orgasm?  Jay Moore wants to know when was your last orgasm?  I want to know when was your last orgasm.  Oh, I'm not getting a good look.
