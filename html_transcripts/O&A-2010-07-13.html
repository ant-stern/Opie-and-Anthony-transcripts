<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with the hosts returning from vacation, noting changes to their studio sound.  They then launch into a detailed account of their Lady Gaga concert experience, focusing on a confrontation instigated by their companion, Kenny, who antagonized concertgoers in their comp section, leading to a shouting match and the removal of several audience members by security.  The hosts debate the justification of their actions given their privileged seating.  Their commentary on Gaga’s performance includes descriptions of her costumes and stage show, alongside opinions on her appearance. They also recount Kenny popping a beach ball with a knife. The conversation then shifts to a raucous 40th birthday party for “Keith the Cop,”  marked by heavy drinking, nudity, and debauchery, including karaoke and poker games.  The hosts discuss pictures from the event, emphasizing the nudity.  A discussion about leaked Mel Gibson tapes, containing racist and misogynistic rants, is interrupted by a call from Patrice O’Neal.

Patrice O’Neal’s call details his own frustrating experience at the Canadian border, involving extensive questioning and refusal of entry due to his refusal to sign an unknown document. He eventually becomes a guest in studio. The in-studio conversation with Patrice O'Neal focuses on his border ordeal, highlighting the bureaucratic hurdles he faced to regain entry, including needing transcripts, sheriff's statements, and clergy letters. He describes the border agent's behavior as racially charged and notes the presence of many black people in a special room during his detention. The conversation then pivots to LeBron James' move to the Miami Heat, with Patrice expressing disappointment and criticizing LeBron's perceived lack of "heart," contrasting him with Jordan, Bird, and Magic Johnson.  They discuss the reaction from Cleveland fans and Dan Gilbert's response, including the lowering of the price of LeBron's wall sticker.  Jesse Jackson's comparison of Gilbert to a slave owner is also debated, touching upon race relations in America and referencing the New Black Panther movement and the historical context of slavery.  Excerpts from Mel Gibson's leaked phone calls are played, and the segment concludes with news of Patrice's friend's death and a funny promo bit about Chris Russo and Sandy Kane farting.

The show continues with an extended segment playing excerpts from Mel Gibson's profanity-laced argument with a woman. The hosts and callers laugh at the absurdity and colorful language, debating whether Gibson is drunk or simply angry and analyzing the woman's role in the argument.  A digression ensues regarding a listener's claim that George Steinbrenner has died, initially doubted by the hosts, but later seemingly confirmed by tweets and news reports.  Speculation on Gibson's career consequences and comparisons to other celebrity scandals follow.

A significant portion focuses on breaking news of George Steinbrenner's apparent death, initially reported by a listener, “RC in Tampa,” via Twitter. The hosts, using highly offensive racial slurs, initially express skepticism and humor.  They debate the credibility of RC's information and speculate about his identity and how he got the information.  As news sources report Steinbrenner’s hospitalization due to a heart attack, the hosts engage with numerous callers offering conflicting information.  They play a listener remix of an interview with Milt Gibson.  Major news outlets later confirm Steinbrenner's death, and the hosts discuss their role in breaking the news, analyzing media coverage, and joking about the situation. A discussion on a 37-year-old woman who had a child with a 15-year-old boy is also included, along with a call-in from someone describing the woman's perspective.  The segment concludes with a discussion and playing of a song created from a previous Alex Jones appearance.


The final segment features a caller recounting his experience with statutory rape and its legal ramifications.  He details a sexual encounter involving himself (age 16), another male, and a 15-year-old girl, contrasting it with a later incident involving blackmail and a school altercation. The caller describes his mother's reaction, his two-month stay in a youth center, and the harsh experience of a co-defendant in adult prison.  He discusses the legal process, judicial leniency, the psychological impact, and connects his experience to publicized cases like the Duke lacrosse and Central Park jogger cases.  He shares stories of navigating prison life and avoiding violence. The conversation expands to discussions of rape accusations, false accusations, and the complexities of consent, particularly within racial dynamics.  The segment concludes with the hosts and caller reflecting on the gravity of the shared stories.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony are no strangers of skin.  Opie and Anthony on Satellite Radio.  Host Anthony Kamiya and Greg Opie.  On the official team.  Opie and Anthony apologizing for yet another approach.  Common profanity link.  Is this the last draw for the Rocky Radio Bureau?  Yee-haw!  Yeah!  Come on.  Bring it on.  You know what?  I think this is hilarious.  A whole big bunch of fun.  The greatest show on Satellite Radio today.  This show is like the box of chocolates.  That Forrest's mother was talking about. 
[00:00:30]  You're a no good son of a bitch.  Bob, you motherfucker.  We're so much fucking better than you.  Absolute lunacy.  If you're giving me the hook, fine.  Whatever.  I do what I'm told.  I'm completely out of control.  It doesn't get better than this.  Come on.  It's shocking.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, we're live fuckers.  Have a look at that, huh?  Back from our vacation. 
[00:01:00]  You heard that, too?  What?  Hello.  How is everybody?  Good.  I hope.  Now that the...  Did they tweak everything while we were gone?  I don't know.  Everything sounds completely different.  Does it?  And I got a headphone jack that's crackling.  Really?  Yeah.  Sounds all right.  I think that's all right now.  You doing good? 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  It completely sounds different.  Whatever.  Back from vacation.  Yes.  Yes.  And I was listening to Jimmy and Sam talk about Lady Gaga.  Lady Gaga.  And you weren't happy about it either, Anthony.  Well, it was a little early to get so gay.  You know, I don't mind sucking each other's cocks, but talking about Lady Gaga at this hour.  I happened to see her July the 5th at the Borgata, not the Borgata, the Atlanta City Boardwalk. 
[00:02:00]  I knew Sam was sitting at the Garden, and she was fucking tremendous.  Yeah.  Her collet you're talking about, right?  I saw it from actually where I was sitting.  I was probably about 500 feet.  Kenny, how far away from her?  You had really good seats, Jim.  We were about maybe 40 yards.  Was it like a 3D movie where it just came out into the crowd?  I actually had to duck back. 
[00:02:30]  Like it was fighting the 13th part three when they only had a couple of the 3D features.  Yes.  The machete.  The machete and the throne fucking spear.  She was tremendous.  Kenny almost started a fucking fight in our section.  Oh, no.  Why?  Because he's Kenny.  We were in the comp section, which were amazing seats.  Sure.  It's a weird thing in AC.  It's like the comps get the best seats, and they're also the ones who don't belong at  the shows that they're at.  If they show at all.  If they show at all. 
[00:03:00]  Casino's got to figure that shit out, man.  We weren't in the casino, but every casino now probably had comps for the show.  So we were dead center stage, but one riser up.  So we're far back, but it's just the way the venue is set up, dead center.  And a bunch of open seats.  And, you know, younger kids are coming in front of us, which is anybody at the arena other  than us was younger than us, standing up and cheering.  And it was a little annoying because we were in our seats.  But I was watching this little fat Asian girl dance, and I wanted to choke her. 
[00:03:30]  I'm like, you little fat pig.  She was just trying to enjoy the Lady Gaga.  I know.  Do you understand where you were?  Exactly.  All right.  So I'm watching her.  I'm getting annoyed.  My chick's with me.  Kenny's with me.  Sit down.  I didn't say sit down, but I was like, you fucking.  And then some other agents came over, and they were all in front of us.  And I was like, God, it's kind of annoying that they're standing.  And Kenny just leans up to them, and he goes, are you going to stand the whole show,  or are you going to sit down? 
[00:04:00]  Oh, no.  You've got to know where you are.  Oh, no.  So fucking, so tsunami kind of shuts some of them down, and they sit down ashamed.  I guess they know they're not in their seats.  So other people come over, and they're doing the same thing.  They're all rowdy and this and that.  And there's one point where these white girls are in front of us,  and Lady Gaga's on stage, and she goes, this is an hour after this incident,  and she goes, you know what I hate?  And Kenny goes, people who won't sit down. 
[00:04:30]  And then he's addressing the people in front of us, who are not even the Asian people from before.  And then the people behind us, older people, big fat guy and his fucking 50-year-old wife,  goes, yeah, they're in front of us.  And so the people behind us and the girls in front of us start getting into a yelling match.  And now there's a real tense fucking situation between these people. 
[00:05:00]  So the girls behind us, there was a 50, how old was the woman behind us who actually?  Yeah, it was like a whole family, like the husband and wife, and then like an adult daughter.  You know, so like the parents were probably in their 50s, and the adult daughter was probably like in her 30s, late 20s.  The adult daughter runs down in front of us, and I had my iPhone, I thought there was going to be a fight.  But then she gets into a yelling match with the girls, and then the fucking father keeps going to get venue security. 
[00:05:30]  There's a guy behind us screaming, I paid for these seats.  I don't want to see this fucking shit.  Fuck you.  He's screaming at the security guard.  There's a guy in the corner who was screaming at the security guard.  And it was this catastrophe.  And Kenny started this whole thing, technically.  Yeah, he absolutely started the whole thing.  And I was angry, too.  Believe me.  And then I look back, like, once the little fat Asian girl in front of us went back to her seat, I was looking at her.  She should have never come over, because she was literally, her real seats were like three rows back and one section over. 
[00:06:00]  She was like sitting in the same place.  So, and she was bopping and dancing.  I'm like, look at the little fat pig.  Like, she's having a ball.  I'm like, they're right, and we are wrong.  Oh, wow.  For myself.  Very big of you.  Just because I'm, and I said it to Kenny and my chick, and my chick, they were annoyed.  I'm like, fuck us.  I'm like, they are in, this is a Lady Gaga concert.  We are casino comp assholes.  This is what we are.  And I'm like, entitled casino comp assholes.  We are fucking wrong.  I'm like, if Lady Gaga came off the stage, she would spit on this section for that fucking girl. 
[00:06:30]  That girl was right.  She was fucking in the right place.  We were, we were behaving wrong.  The whole arena was on their feet.  12,000 people.  Yes.  Except our section were just seated, like reserved, quiet.  Didn't have to do any.  It's a Broadway show.  Didn't have to do anything for your tickets.  I got so angry.  They were just handed to you because of who you are.  These people had to wait in the rain for weeks to get their dumb tickets.  And this fat guy behind me yelling at these girls. 
[00:07:00]  Now it turns out, venue security came over and eventually removed the girls because they  weren't in their seats.  So they were dumb bitches because technically they were wrong.  It's like, there were four girls dancing.  Two of them didn't have to move because that was their seats and you're allowed to stand  up during a concert.  And two had to move.  And they were dumb concerts.  Like if you're not in your seat, at least don't cause a fucking problem.  Mel Gibson, calm down.  But this fat motherfucker yelling at these girls really annoyed me.  It's like, first of all, if they were four young fucking black guys, you would not be 
[00:07:30]  yelling at them like that, you fucking faggot.  It's like, that's why I didn't yell at the girls because Kenny would have yelled at four  young black guys.  This fat pig behind me would not have.  So it annoyed me that he was trying to tough guy four fucking girls.  But it's like the whole arena is standing and who doesn't want to dance to Alejandro?  God damn it, is that a fucking good song.  I hate how she says that.  Alejandro.  Alejandro.  She's fucking great.  She did her fucking speechless.  Oh, is that a fucking great show, man? 
[00:08:00]  Are you ready to admit, though, she's ugly?  I don't care.  I think she's sexy.  You're about to admit it, though, finally.  I don't think she's ugly.  I think she's not really.  Did you see what she looked like when she was doing her Today Show thing?  I didn't watch her.  She looks like a combination of Liza Minnelli and Madonna now.  Yeah.  She's not a pretty woman.  She's not a hot chick, but she's something very sexy about her.  You're finally admitting it, though.  I never said she's beautiful.  It's the long legs and stuff.  You were all in.  You thought she was pretty hot at first.  I think she's sexy.  I still do, but she's not beautiful.  Yeah, there's something sexy about her. 
[00:08:30]  There was another incident at the concert.  What was that?  I don't even remember.  Was there?  What, Kenny?  It was a beach ball mishap.  Oh, God.  The fucking...  What's that?  Oh, the fucking fun killer.  Were you guys part of a beach ball mishap?  Please tell me you popped it in front of everybody.  I hope Kenny shot it.  You know how the beach ball comes everywhere?  Of course.  Didn't make it much past us.  Oh, no.  What'd you do to the beach ball, Kenny?  I popped with my knife.  It was on the floor, and he fucking just leans over, and I saw, like, when it went back 
[00:09:00]  up, it was half deflated.  You popped it with a knife.  You killed joy.  Yeah, when it came to me, I had my knife in my hand, so I just pretended I was, like,  hitting it, but I popped it.  And then the poor lady, like, in the row behind me, you know, she went to hit it.  She wanted to hit it.  Like, all deflated on her hand.  And it just went...  You guys just ruining everyone's time at the Lady Gaga.  At Lady Gaga. 
[00:09:30]  Yelling at teenagers.  It was really horrible.  Rape Kid.  Kenny is a fun vacuum.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But Lady Gaga, I know she's a great entertainer.  She's a great entertainer.  She was great.  Kenny likes Lady Gaga, too.  Kenny likes Lady Gaga.  Sam and Eric went to see Lady Gaga, too.  Maybe they have some interest.  Together?  No, not together.  Together?  We didn't even go on the same night.  No.  You should have seen all the people that dress up.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I bet.  What do they dress up as?  Do people, like, have telephone hats? 
[00:10:00]  Really?  Oh, the gayest kid on earth was in front of us.  Telephone hats?  He had a hat.  It was a little yellow telephone.  I've never seen a gayer, more uncoordinated person.  Yes!  My telephone hat.  A telephone hat.  Look at me.  Scrolls, scrolls, scrolls.  Look at that faggot with the guy in the fucking leopard skin.  Predictable.  Sam.  Sam, what picture is that?  Well, they dress up like it's Halloween?  Yeah, the guy sitting next to me was wearing spandex and chain mail. 
[00:10:30]  Why?  Because it's a Gaga show.  Everybody's celebrating.  They're going to the Monster Ball.  You know, I cannot stand the vibe behind the Gaga sensation.  I just don't like it.  It seems very flamboyant.  It is.  It's about letting your freak flag fly.  Is it?  Yeah.  Aren't they called little monsters or something?  That's what the fans are calling.  We get our claws up.  Little monsters.  What?  We get our claws.  Stop it.  You have to put your claws up? 
[00:11:00]  Stop it.  If you're a fan.  Put your claws up.  Are you sure, Kenny?  Claws.  Why would a paw go like this?  Yeah, monsters have claws, not paws.  That's true.  He knows he's wrong.  Monsters have claws and black suit jackets.  Yeah, you put your claws up and you stand up and you sing and dance.  Yeah, the whole Monster's Ball thing is kind of like Wizard of Oz theme when she talks you through the show.  And then you find the Monster's Ball and then you become liberated so you can come out of the closet. 
[00:11:30]  It's like for 12-year-olds or 13.  It's for young gay teens.  It's basically who she's aimed at.  It's a weird audience.  Someone's saying it's the same shit those club kid fags were doing in 92.  Is that it?  I guess so.  Is it like the club kids?  Remember when like Maury used to have club kids on all the time?  Is that it?  And their parents would be yelling because the guys are wearing eyeliner and shit.  Except they're not going to clubs. 
[00:12:00]  They're going to giant arenas now.  Great.  That's her audience?  No, her audience is everybody.  No, it's not everybody.  Oh, it's everybody.  Honestly, dude.  We were at the fucking...  I was sitting with Bobby Kelly, my girlfriend, Bob's wife, and Voss.  Bobby went to see Lady Gaga?  This is in Montreal at the festival.  And we're eating...  This is two days ago.  And Alejandro's on the fucking radio.  And Voss and I never agree on anything.  And Bobby...  Of course.  And all of us agreed that it was a great song.  It's like her audience is fucking everybody.  My mom saw the Today Show, and now my mom's a fan. 
[00:12:30]  My dad was humming the songs when I got home.  Oh, everybody.  Humming through his giant handlebar mustache.  Yes.  People think it's fake because he likes Lady Gaga.  He thinks he just stuck it on as a prop.  Is your dad a little monster?  Yeah.  Does he have his claws up?  He's becoming a little monster.  Is he?  Yeah.  Oh, your family's weird.  It's just this whole...  You've got a weird family.  Freaky queer thing going on.  Well...  She went on stage and announced that she had a big fucking cock. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, really?  That's pretty outrageous.  That's fucking crazy outrageous.  It was a little self-indulgent.  At one point, she laid on the stage in fog and said that she was just like Tinkerbell,  and if we didn't clap for her, she would die.  I would have chopped people's hands off just to see if it was true.  True.  Oh, yeah.  She did say that when she was lying on her back.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  She did it at your show, too, so it wasn't spontaneous?  No.  Oh, I thought she just made it up.  Yeah.  And she didn't win any Grammys, right? 
[00:13:30]  She won no Grammys?  I don't think so.  No, I think...  I think she sort of got shut out.  The problem was she was shut out from Best New Artist.  I think she won some Grammys, but she didn't win Best New Artist, which she should have.  Well, who was better than her last year?  Exactly.  No one.  Except she wasn't eligible for the nomination.  I don't think they like all that nonsense.  Yeah, they don't like the nonsense.  They kind of want her to just sing.  That fucking stupid performance art shit.  She does a costume change for every song. 
[00:14:00]  Really?  Yeah.  That's got to be exhausting.  We went through the back of the venue.  I haven't changed my outfit in two years.  30 trucks for her show.  The entire underground of the venue was tractor trailers.  The guy's like, that's all for her show.  30?  30 fucking tractor trailers.  And 12 buses.  Holy shit.  That's so unnecessary.  That's insane.  At one point, she started playing piano out of a car hood.  It was incredible.  It was good.  It was good.  I saw that. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Did you?  Yeah.  That's incredible.  You guys would enjoy the show, I think, if you would.  No.  I think you would, Anthony.  I didn't envision our first day back talking about Lady Gaga.  Lady Gaga.  With all the stuff that happened over break.  I bought a special edition Madison Square Gaga t-shirt.  No.  Stop it.  There is no fucking way.  Why would you buy a Lady Gaga t-shirt?  For $40?  There's no way you could wear it anywhere.  I could wear that shirt.  Where?  Anywhere.  Why aren't you wearing it now? 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Come on.  I'm so proud of it.  I'll wear it tomorrow.  Madison Square Gaga?  Yeah.  I would love to have had that.  It says Madison Square Gaga.  Special edition for the show that I went to.  Kenny, you know you're going to have to get Jimmy Wood now.  Oh, my.  Yeah, exactly.  Lady Gaga.  Oh, my.  Fuck Ozzy, man.  She's the shit.  Are we done with the Lady Gaga?  Thursday, Jimmy, there's a thing on the Biography channel.  You know, Biography? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Black Sabbath documentary.  Thank you.  Yes.  Thank you very much.  Yeah, you might have set your DVR for that one.  I've been watching some of the commercials they've had for it.  It sounds pretty funny.  A lot of just drug-induced fucking stories that they're telling about the old days.  I don't believe it.  No, I don't believe a word of it.  We got Kenny singing Lady Gaga.  Lady Gaga?  So we'll end this little segment with this and move on to other things that happened during the vacation.  Hello, hello, baby. 
[00:16:00]  You called?  I can't hear a thing.  I've got no service in the club, you see, see.  What, what, what did you say?  Oh, you're breaking up on me.  Sorry I can't hear you, I'm kinda busy.  Kinda, kinda, kinda busy.  Kinda, kinda busy.  Kinda, kinda.  Sorry I can't hear you, I'm kinda busy.  Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play. 
[00:16:30]  And I can't text you with a drink in my hand, eh.  You should've made some plans with me, you know that I was free.  And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kinda busy.  Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore.  I left my head and my heart on the dance floor.  Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore.  I left my head and my heart on the dance floor. 
[00:17:00]  Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh 
[00:17:30]  You're not going to reach my telephone.  You know, because I fleecy out, you got no complaints.  That was terrific, Kenny.  Did you have a good vacation, Kenny?  You got no complaints.  No, I stayed home.  And did nothing?  I did some paperwork.  I did some other work.  What do you do for fun?  Working vacation, they call that, right? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, that's what I do.  We were gone for about 12 days, I think.  Kenny can't have fun.  Yeah, what was the funnest thing you did during the break?  I went out to dinner.  He just can't have fun.  But you do that usually.  You got to eat.  What did you have, a grilled chicken?  I went to a hibachi steakhouse.  Oh, that's great.  That's fancy for you.  Yeah.  Yeah, those oriental people.  It's not oriental.  Asian, whatever. 
[00:18:30]  Did they do the tricks?  Yeah, they have a sharp knife.  Did they make the onion volcano for you?  Yeah, yeah.  That's kind of nice, right?  But I freak out everybody at my table because when they light it with the big lighter, I go,  Oh!  And I jump up, and it scares everybody at the table.  At the table.  I can picture him doing that.  Does he embarrass your wife?  Yeah.  Oh, of course.  And do you, what do you do when he does like a trick, like pops the shrimp tail into his 
[00:19:00]  hat and stuff.  Do you clap?  I know.  And then they try to shoot a piece into your mouth.  Yeah, yeah.  Did he catch it?  No.  I don't, I didn't move.  Do you want to play along?  Yeah, yeah.  Kenny's just not fun.  Rape Kid's calling you Kenny Hanna.  Kenny Hanna.  Kenny Hanna.  Yes.  Ah, Jesus Christ.  All right, well, that's, that's exciting.  Yeah. 
[00:19:30]  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  Yeah, I'm sure everybody had just a great, great time.  It was just nice not to have to get up so goddamn early.  It was weird to hear that alarm this morning, huh?  What the fuck is that about?  My alarm.  Hello, Anthony, wake up.  I got the new Kenny alarm.  Oh, he's your new alarm clock?  I got the new Kenny alarm system, which should keep me here on time.  I smell, I smell bit.  Oh, God. 
[00:20:00]  The Kenny alarm.  Kenny alarm.  That'll, that'll wake you up, though.  Wake up, Anthony.  I'm like, oh, God, why?  How do you wake up?  I just want to slip my wrist.  How do you wake up, Anthony?  Because I'm, I'm privy to the, uh, Jim Norton wake up call every morning, because it happens  in the car.  Oh, so far, Anthony's been very perky in the morning.  But what's your thing?  Like, what do you say to Jimmy every morning?  It's exact, too.  And it has to be at, uh, 530 every morning.  Yeah, but today I was negligent with James.  Well, first day back from vacation, we all understand. 
[00:20:30]  But what do you usually say?  I go, hello, James, 530.  And what's, uh, what's Anthony's?  Do you mix it up a little bit?  No, I think Anthony gets up like five minutes before.  Yeah, I kind of, I set my alarm before the Kenny call.  Then there's an awkward little small talk thing, then.  Yeah, I'm like, hi, Kenny.  Good morning.  Yeah.  I go, you ready for work?  And I go, oh, yeah, I'm up as a pup.  Ready to go. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, yeah, ready to go.  And then he hangs up and I fall back to sleep.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It just was not, uh, fun, though, having to, um, having to get up.  You get those, you get that two days of vacation left and all you're thinking is, ah, it's only  a couple of days left.  It sucks.  Yeah, I, I, I had a really good vacation, but you're kind of right.  Then the last two days, you already feel like you're back in work.  Yeah, you're like, ah, I got to start getting myself into that. 
[00:21:30]  I mean, I still had a weekend left and I did nothing.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I felt like, oh, vacation's over.  Vacation's over.  We're going to go to work.  So I just sat around and did nothing for the last two days.  Yeah.  I could have got some stuff done.  Stuff?  Oh, you were busy.  I sure was.  I saw your videos.  Traveling the globe.  No.  Or at least, you know, New York.  Yeah, I went up to Soda's point.  It's a, it's a, it's a great spot and it would be an amazing spot if, if, if summer didn't  last like three weeks. 
[00:22:00]  That's it, huh?  That's all they got up there.  That's the only reason why it's not the most amazing place on earth.  Because you got Lake Ontario right there.  So you could put your, you could bring, you could get your boat right out onto the lake  in seconds and do all that shit.  And then they got a bay also.  And then they got restaurants on the bay.  And everyone's on the bay doing tubing and water skiing and jet skiing.  But the, and I go to Wheeze, it's Wheeze's place.  I'm like, what, what the fuck?  He's like, well, it's because summer only lasts four or five weeks up here.  That's ridiculous.  That's why this isn't a gold mine. 
[00:22:30]  That is goddamn ridiculous.  You got a beautiful boating community that you can only, you know, use a month, month and  a half a year.  We got an icebreaker up there.  Yeah.  But we got to watch old school fireworks, old school fireworks.  Anthony remembers.  We all remember in this room when, when the neighborhoods would just like try to outdo  each other, not even the neighborhoods, like each house would try to outdo each other.  Yeah.  Remember they would just put what barriers up at the end of the street and say, you know,  don't go down this street tonight.  Yeah.  Not those safe and sane fireworks either. 
[00:23:00]  The ones that you light a little fountain or something.  I mean, fireworks are cool if you're, if you're lighting them.  If you're just watching fireworks, who gives a shit?  You got to be lighting them.  Unless you're really close, which I was fortunate enough to be.  One of the guys we were with got injured.  It was just the whole thing that happened.  Very injured.  And it's got to happen during 4th of July.  Some guy out on Long Island.  Wow.  He really went all in.  Did you see the picture?  I didn't see the picture.  Oh, someone sent me a picture of this poor son of a bitch. 
[00:23:30]  Was it in the paper?  No, no.  Oh, really?  This was somebody that knew, yeah, and texted me a picture.  What happened?  He blew off his arm?  His arm, but they said arm.  It's more than an arm?  It was from his neck.  No.  To his side.  Was gone.  Just fucking gone.  Just blasted that whole thing off him.  It looked like steak, like cooked steak.  How did that happen?  He, uh, big mortar shell was in a pipe, lights it. 
[00:24:00]  Mm-hmm.  It doesn't go off.  Mm-hmm.  And it happens all the time.  Usually it kills the guy because they pop their face over the top of it.  This guy was kind of coming in from the side, and as his shoulder got over the mortar,  boom, it went off and just blew his arm right off.  Wow.  And the picture is pretty brutal.  Oh, yeah.  He's laying in the ambulance, and he's got the oxygen on, and you just see his arm is  gone.  They don't even have anything on it.  It's not bleeding or anything. 
[00:24:30]  Why doesn't it bleed anymore?  It's just fucking, I think it was so burnt and crispy.  Oh, right, right, right.  It's just a mess.  Yeah, it was really rank.  Well, I guess that's why they try to keep the fireworks safe for everyone, but you know  what?  I said we go back to old school fireworks, and we lose a few every year.  It would be worth it.  You got to.  The one I was at the year before, a guy blew off his, well, it's nothing compared to what  you're talking about, but blew off his thumb or something.  His thumb, Charlie.  And this year, we were 40 or 50 feet away as they're blowing off these mortars, and it 
[00:25:00]  was raining, all the crap after, you know, it does the beautifulness above you, and then  all the shit falls on top of you.  That's how close we were.  And the guy right in front of me, bald guy, got hit in the head, a nice gash in his head  from one of the mortars that was falling from the sky.  The video was cool of the stuff falling on top of you.  It actually looked like...  It was right over our heads.  Yeah, that would kind of make me uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Well, I asked somebody, is this safe?  They're like, yeah, we do this every year.  And then told me that last year, one guy lost his thumb, and this year, the guy in 
[00:25:30]  front of me got a nice gash in his fucking head.  Yeah, that's good.  And at one point, they started shooting sideways toward us, but, you know, nothing to report  really, but instead of going straight up, now it was more toward us, but that's the  way to go with fireworks.  Oh, yeah.  I really spend much...  Fourth of July.  Let me see if I could remember out of my alcoholic fog was what I did on the fourth. 
[00:26:00]  Was there a lot of alcohol in the last four days?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  The keg guy was like...  Enough already?  Yeah.  He came down and actually, and called for a keg, and they're like, oh, it's a private  house.  They're like, oh, yeah, we don't usually do the same day delivery to private...  And she goes, no, she goes...  And then she gave the address, and the guy goes, oh, okay, I know you.  I'll be right over.  Yeah, yeah.  And he was.  He came over.  Wait, you had a same day delivery?  On a keg?  Oh, on a few kegs. 
[00:26:30]  Holy shit.  That's pretty impressive.  Had a big 40th birthday there for Keith the Cop.  And wow.  Just Sodom and Gomorrah.  Oh, my God.  That was Sunday?  Yeah, that was Sunday.  And oh, I can't...  I don't know what to say about it.  It degenerated into just clothing optional, pool fucking drinking. 
[00:27:00]  Just a bunch of cops and you?  Yeah, it was great.  I see Jill Nicolini made an appearance at the big party Sunday.  Yes.  Actually, yes.  Jill showed up.  Looking at a picture of you and her over the fire pit.  And that, of course, would be the fire pit where she burned the clothes of the other girl.  The infamous fire pit.  And then there's a few other pictures that popped up.  Oh, wow.  She was very nice, you know.  Hung out. 
[00:27:30]  Very cordial.  Was nice.  She didn't want to rip your head off?  Nah, we talked.  You know.  It's like, what are you going to do?  Two years ago.  Did you bury the hatchet?  In my head.  Did you kind of like talk it over a little bit?  Yeah, and then we got, what, the most awkward picture ever taken, which is, yeah, that's  that one there.  There we go.  See, unfortunately, Facebook doesn't allow for nudity in their pictures, so the majority 
[00:28:00]  of pictures taken probably will never see the light of day.  Yeah, yeah.  All I remember seeing was nude D-boy going up to the bar for a drink.  Derek was very naked.  Derek was very naked, and then there was just naked girls jumping from the jacuzzi into  the pool, up on the little floaty things.  It was just, it was just insanity. 
[00:28:30]  It was just, all I could keep saying is, this is the greatest party ever.  Beavis, this is the greatest party ever.  It was really sick and just booze fueled.  Then there was, and then why end it there?  Because then there was karaoke.  I don't even know.  People from down the street were stopping by.  I had no clue who they were.  Then poker games broke out.  It was just one of those. 
[00:29:00]  When was the party over?  I don't know, but the sky was already blue.  The sky was turning blue.  You made it to the skies of the blue.  Made it to the blue sky.  Blue sky.  Yeah.  So that was a nice way to ring out the vacation.  Oof.  Good time, though.  Everybody was sober at that party.  Oh, Chip.  Oh, sarcastic Chip.  Oh, great.  There's Keith's ass. 
[00:29:30]  Keith is naked in that picture.  Keith has, by far, the worst ass on any person.  It is just a, like, it looks like an old man's Irish ass.  It is.  You act like Keith's an 18-year-old girl.  That's the ass, that's the fucking ass Keith should have.  Keith has a cop ass.  I'm sitting in a patrol car his whole life. 
[00:30:00]  Just a flat ass from sitting.  And then D-Boy was getting into everybody's pictures and pulling his pants down.  D-Boy, we found out D-Boy just loves having his pants down.  Somebody just fucking loves it.  Just naked and drunk.  Yes.  Loves being drunk and taking his clothes off.  It was...  What about the girls?  Who got naked?  Oh, there's...  I don't...  I...  Who got naked?  Which girls got naked?  I'm not going to implicate anybody, but I don't remember seeing one girl that wasn't... 
[00:30:30]  It just...  The people that had remained by the time the party got naked was the people that were going  to get naked.  Yeah, yeah.  So it was pretty much everybody who was left at that time.  It just turned into a big naked fest.  It just started in the jacuzzi, and then it just poured...  Spilled out into the pool, and...  It's one of those when in Rome situations.  You know, you come out, everybody's naked.  You're like, fuck it.  Yeah, fuck it.  Now I gotta get naked, too.  Fuck it.  Let's all get naked.  You got naked? 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, I got naked.  Everybody.  Danny got naked.  Everybody got naked.  Like, that's the first time I've been naked in that pool.  Please.  Please.  Please.  There's always some kind of fucking debauchery.  Drunken...  It's a good idea when you're drunk.  What does the pool look like the next day?  Oh, my God.  Egg drop soup.  I would love to see that picture.  The skimmers are just full of pubes.  I'd love to see what it picks up.  Yeah.  That was great.  And I started out the vacation by seeing Jimmy at the Borgata. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, how was that, Jimmy?  It was great, man.  Great.  Really, really fun, yes.  It was really funny, man.  Very funny show, James.  I didn't like the Friday show.  I liked the Saturday show a lot.  Oh, well, we didn't like you either.  I mean, it was 10...  It started late.  It was too hot outside.  I was really hoping for rain.  Rain helps shows a lot.  Yeah.  Gets people...  Gets everybody in.  Gets them off the boardwalk.  But considering it was 4th of July weekend, and it was fucking...  It was really great, man.  Yeah.  Fans are really cool.  It was nice seeing you there. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, of course.  Watched you gamble for a little while.  Yes.  How's the gambling?  He was very surly by the time I went upstairs.  Yes.  I wasn't getting what I call traction.  I wasn't getting any traction.  That girl...  There was a female dealer.  She fucking hated Anthony.  Oh, wow.  Because Anthony just kept saying, I hate you.  I hate you.  I go, I hate you.  I hate you.  Deal me something I can play with. 
[00:32:30]  Go ahead.  Deal me a car.  Oh, of course.  Yeah, another 14 for me.  Thanks.  Oh, what do you got?  A show and a queen?  I bet I know it's on the...  Can I bet you have 20?  Is there a side bet I can make that says you have 20?  I hate you.  She was kicking Anthony's balls all over that table.  Oh, was she?  Just took a hit?  Anyone should take that with you, you fucking prick.  You should have just took money out of your pocket and handed it to her.  Yeah, just handed it to her.  Here you go. 
[00:33:00]  You give a little back, finally?  Yeah, it wasn't...  Oh, boy.  It was not a winning weekend.  You had a nice run there.  Poor Gata.  Yeah, you know, what am I going to complain?  What are you going to do?  It was great.  What are you going to do?  They hooked me up with a nice giant suite and they, you know, take care of dinner.  Dinner was like, all right, it's fucking 20 to 8.  And I call and get a reservation at the premier fucking place in the Borgata for 8 o'clock.  I would love to know who they kicked out for you. 
[00:33:30]  Who gives a shit?  They were probably already sitting and having appetizers.  Whatever.  You up.  Out.  They probably have a trap door at the special table.  The seats just flip over.  There's other seats there.  Exactly what it was.  I would love to see that.  Oh, yeah.  It looks like vacation was good.  Yeah, it was good.  And in between the Borgata and Keith's party, if anyone could fill me in on what happened that week, I would definitely appreciate it. 
[00:34:00]  Of what?  In between the Borgata, which was the beginning of the vacation, and Keith's party, which was the end.  Right.  So if anyone has any knowledge of what I did the rest of that week, please feel free to tell me.  Because to me, it's just a poker game and vomit.  What?  What's that about?  There was a poker game and then some vomiting. 
[00:34:30]  Who vomited?  I think everybody.  It was just a big, like a fucking Roman barfitorium.  I don't know.  What was I drinking?  Oh, yeah.  I was drinking a sweet beer wine.  Sweet beer wine.  I wanted to play some poker, so I invited some people over and drank.  Drank some wine.  And then I just wasn't feeling very good.  And when you puke up red wine, it looks like you're one of the monsters from 28 Days Later. 
[00:35:00]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Just fucking red shit coming out of your mouth.  Was the vomiting happening during the poker game, or the next day?  Or a little of both?  It was like at the end of the night, yeah.  What goes in the hole comes out of the hole 
[00:35:30]  Get it all out  Your body's rejecting it  I'm sorry  It's all your hands here  I need a sandwich just me  I don't want to go home  Where are my keys?  I love Dr. Steve Bruhl  He's by his car drunk off his ass  He's trying to get in his car 
[00:36:00]  He's trying to drunk drive  And falls down in front of the car  Steve Bruhl  If you drink too much wine  Give your friends a carrier  Get the door  Tell your friends a carrier  How incredibly hard is it to watch John C. Reilly in anything else now?  In anything  I was watching Boogie Nights  Boogie Nights was on  So I was watching that  And his character in Boogie Nights  Has so many little Steve Bruhl moments  You realize it's like  Holy shit, that's probably really him  And he's in some new movie 
[00:36:30]  Cyrus with Jonah Hill  And I think Marissa Tomei  And Travis was mentioning last week  He just can't even watch the trailer for it  Because he can't take it seriously  He's just like  It's fucking Steve  Dr. Steve Bruhl  Dr. Steve Bruhl  Come on  What do we have here?  The building blocks of shishy  Shishy  Shishy meat  Peaches  And guacamole  And guacamole  He's the best  Alright, we should take a break  Of course we got the Mel Gibson tapes  Oh yeah 
[00:37:00]  Regular radio can't touch this shit  This, uh  When I heard the first one  Yeah, we'll play the first one  Because the first one happened during the break  So we'll play the first one  Which is only a minute and fifty  And then we'll get into tape two  Which is just beyond amazing  There's so much to decipher here  Right?  Yes  Alright, we'll get right into the Mel Gibson thing  After the break  Stay there  The Virus Sirius XM  This is the Opinion 3 Show  Opinion 3  Back from vacation 
[00:37:30]  We missed a lot too, man  We missed the Mel Gibson tapes  Yeah  Although the second tape is still very, very hot  First tape was  His great little rant with the  His racist rant  Which I, um  I don't know  It's a telephone conversation  Absolutely right 
[00:38:00]  No, you don't  Say whatever you want  And Michael Richards said something publicly  Which was stupid  That's fair game  This is something like Dog  Or like Alec Baldwin  Look  People fucking yell things on the phone  Yeah  God  Private conversation  And some dummy is taping you  And, uh, you, you know  Blurt something out  Well, how the hell are you holding against somebody  And fire them  What's the backstory, though?  Uh, Mel Gibson was married for many years  Had a lot of kids with his wife 
[00:38:30]  And then, uh  28 years  28 years, dumped her  Then he found some, uh  Hot piece of ass  Crazy Russian model chick  Or whatever she is  He found a face  Yeah  With no substance behind it  And obviously the relationship is going bad already  They have an eight-month-old, I think  Yeah  Yeah  And she's there taping him  On the other side of the conversation  Uh, other side of the phone  And then releasing it to everybody  And he  Is losing his fucking mind  She said he had hit her, though  I'm not defending her 
[00:39:00]  I fucking loathe her  But she said he was abusive  But nobody believed her  Mm-hmm  Um, that he was, like, an abusive guy  And people just didn't believe it  Or men, I tend to believe that  He probably did whack her  Well, listening to him go off like that  Uh, you can see how it could  Kind of take the next step  To cracking her in the face, perhaps  I think  There's a Chris Rock thing happening there  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  But I understand  There's something like  Ah, the next  Because  The next step is just cracking her 
[00:39:30]  I think he's a drunk  Um, I think  He sounds to me like a drunk  Who, uh, is yelling when he's drunk  They don't  They, that sounds just like  The ramblings  You talking about Mel Gibson or me?  Mel Gibson  Oh, okay  You're a happy drunk  You're talking about the Borgata  You're a happy drunk  Mel Gibson seems to be, uh,  An unhappy drunk  Yeah  My phone conversations are fun  Yeah  Okay, good  You don't say racist stuff  Come on, Oliver  You don't say racist stuff on the phone 
[00:40:00]  You just yell it at the dealer  So why don't we play the first, uh, Mel Gibson tape  Uh, the racist one  It's a quickie  Yeah  And then, man, you know  Sam cut up the second tape  But fuck that  I say we just let it roll  Let it fly  All seven minutes and 53 seconds of goodness  Compelling, I love it  Yeah  Trying to breastfeed  First one  Fucking foreign bodies in you  So  Was that it?  It had nothing to do with it  Oh, it had nothing to do with what?  The fact that you had foreign bodies in there?  Correct 
[00:40:30]  Correct, okay, good  So you're not lying to me about fake tits  I've never heard  Yes  Yes, you just did  You said they weren't  You fucking lied to me  Before  I didn't  He can't tell that they're fake or not?  That's a little weird, no?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Yeah, I mean, come on  What the fuck?  Maybe they were, uh, not fake as far as  No, no, foreign bodies  I was saying instead of, uh  Whatever makes fake tits  But don't they have fat implants from your own body too?  Well, they do it many different ways, Jimmy  Yeah  And they go in many different ways too 
[00:41:00]  Sometimes they take the nipple off  Sometimes they just go under the, uh  Armpit  Armpit  And then push it in  That's hard to detect  And sometimes they use fat  Sometimes they use silicone  Silicone's supposedly making a big comeback  Oh  Yeah  I didn't  I never said  I never said anything  Of a kind  You never asked me  I never told you  Or maybe you asked me  But I never lied about this  Not a lie  Who cares?  So  They look ridiculous 
[00:41:30]  Get rid of them  Why don't you?  Anyway, uh  You know  That's none of your fucking business  What they said  It is, it is  They look stupid  I'm just telling you  It's just an appraisal  Keep them if you want  Look stupid  See if I give a fuck  No, but they're too big  And they look stupid  They look like some Vegas bitch  They look like a Vegas whore  And you go around  Sashaying around  In your tight clothes  And stuff  I won't stand for that anymore  I don't  I don't walk around  I don't walk  I don't walk around  In tight clothes  I stay at home  For most of the time  You go out in public  And it's a fucking embarrassment to me 
[00:42:00]  You look like a fucking bitch on heat  And if you get raped  By a pack of niggers  It'll be your fault  Alright?  See he's trying  He's just trying to help  I know  And it's like  Who cares that he said that  Like  You know  First of all  If they do rape you  If you're raped by a pack of blacks  And you refer to them as niggers  Are you a bad guy  Or are they worse for raping you  By being mad at that  What people are saying is  Do not call the rapists 
[00:42:30]  A racial epithet  Fucking asshole country  They may have raped her  But don't use the N word  Stop it  Oh shit  Because you provoked it  You are provocatively dressed all the time  With your fake boobs  You feel you have to show off  In tight outfits  And tight pants and stuff  You see your pussy from behind  And that green thing today was enough  That's provocative  Okay?  I'm telling you  I'm just telling you the truth 
[00:43:00]  I don't like it  I don't want that woman  I don't want you  I don't believe you anymore  I don't trust you  I don't love you  I don't want you  Okay?  Okay  Stay in the fucking house  I'm not giving it to you  But I'll let you stay there  Okay?  I'm really confused  Because  Wow man  All the stuff he doesn't like about her  Yeah  Wasn't that what attracted  Oh that happens a lot  Yeah  Yeah that happens a lot  You know  He was attracted by all that stuff 
[00:43:30]  And now he hates  Hates all that stuff  You go for the whore  And uh  You know  And then you realize  You don't want the  Do we know where this went bad?  Not sure  Not sure?  Because obviously it went bad  Before this phone call started  During Mel's upbringing  Perhaps  In Australia  This whole thing is a guy  Just yelling about his chick  Because he really thinks  That she's behaving like a whore  Or dressing like a whore  And he said  If you get raped by a pack of niggers 
[00:44:00]  That's just some dumb thing  You yell when you're drunk  It doesn't mean anything  There's not a racial component  To this argument  But once again  He didn't care that you  Dressed like a whore  So what went wrong  Where all of a sudden  He turned on this whole thing  You know what I mean?  It's what happens in relationships  You don't want  He knew exactly what he was  Getting into with this broad  Now guys do this all the time  They pick up a girl  Who's dressed provocatively  Her personality is  Kind of flirtatious  And whore-like  And shit like that  And then after a few months  Or a year  Whatever the fuck it is  You start looking 
[00:44:30]  And you think  Like I don't want  What's she dressing like that for?  Going outside  Some guy's gonna fucking  You know  See that  And pick up on her  It's more commonplace  Than the other way around  Where guys are fine  With her being a whore  Or looking like a whore  For the entire relationship  Well our lovely executive producer  Has unbelievable timing  We wanted Patrice O'Neal  On the show for other things  But Patrice is calling in now  Right in the middle  Of the Mel Gibson tape 
[00:45:00]  So this is perfect timing  Thank you Steve  Really appreciate that  So we'll get back  To the Mel Gibson tapes  In a second  Patrice  Good morning  And we woke up Patrice  So we have to go to Patrice  We can't like wake him up  And then tell him  Go back to sleep  Because now you know  We can call you later  How are you sir?  Good man  What's going on man?  Oh he's a sleepy boy  Yeah you sound sleepy  I wasn't really  I was in sort of room  And then  It seems like I'll call you back 
[00:45:30]  But if y'all call me back  In 25 minutes  I'd have been  I'd have been out man  Oh you would be out for the night  Or the morning  Whatever  Your night  I wanted to talk to you  Because we had a great conversation  About LeBron James  But then Jimmy's telling me  That you couldn't get into Montreal  I read it on your Twitter  Yeah yeah man  You know  You know  Back in the day  I mean I've been there  I've been there 40 times  You know what I mean  Since  Since 95 or so 
[00:46:00]  But  I drove up  I usually drive up now  Because I  You know  I don't like to fly  They don't have big planes  And so I don't get on  The  You know  Any little planes  So I  I drive there now  And  You know  They always give me  Problems or whatever  Just cause  It's  You know  I don't know what they see  But  You know  They let me in  So  I went up there  This time  Patrice  You look really scary  Well  First impression 
[00:46:30]  You look very scary  And then we realize  You're just a lovable  Fucking  He's not lovable  He's lovable  I love Patrice  He's lovable  When you get to know him  He's lovable  Huh  I wouldn't say I was lovable  I would say  That I'm not  That I'm not  Look at  I mean  You guys  Jimmy looks like a Nazi  And you look like  You know  Dan Gilbert  You know  From the Cleveland  You know  And  Anthony doesn't look like  What he is  But  He is what he is  And  But you know 
[00:47:00]  You know me  You get to know me  I mean I'm whatever  Whatever  But the girl  You know  One thing you don't do  When you go to Canada  You don't try to be charming  Going  Like  I just  I'm learning that you  You take it  The way somebody  Wants to give it  So  You know  They look at you  They look at your paperwork  There was  There was two phases  One was like  The toll booth  Thing that you go through  They could stop you there  But he let me through  Because I had all the 
[00:47:30]  All the work permits  And  And when you ask  When you get the work permits  They do checks  On the work permit  So you can't even get a work permit  Unless they do a check  So if somebody does a check  You get a work permit  I've been there a million times  They send me to  To the immigration  You know  To  Do whatever they gotta do  Because of the work permit  Right  So  If I didn't have a work permit  I probably wouldn't have to go deal with that  But  I go on immigration  And I go up to  The  The Swiss Miss 
[00:48:00]  Instant Cocoa Girl  With two braids  And  And glasses  She looked like  The chick that  Jaws was  Fucking  In Moonraker  Nice reference  Okay  You know what I'm saying  Right  So I go up  I'm going to  She's like  You know  What do you hear for  And I'm like  I'm going to do the comedy thing  And  Just for laughs  She's like  What do you hear  And I go  Here's my thing  So she's  She's back there  I'm thinking  She's going to come back

[00:53:30]  With  Something dumb  Yeah  And the Patrice story  He told  On this show  A while ago  I mean  Yeah  It wasn't rape  Simple as that  No  We don't have to get  Into it for the next hour  There's no  You know  We joke about the shit  The rape  Bitty rape  It's just like  Rape  Bitty rape  But you know  When there's enough  Motherfuckers  Especially when white boys  Get into that situation  We know the Scottsboro boys  But when the Duke Lacrosse boys  Get into that  And then  You get the Tawana Brawley shit 
[00:54:00]  You know  The more that shit happens  The better  The less  Like a rip it  Side look  You know  Like  Look man  It's like  You 17  You fuck a 15 year old  You committed a crime  You know what I mean  So  Back then  Before the internet  And scary things  It's like  You know  It's like  That's no big deal  But now  You know  I'm 300 pounds  With grey beard hair  I'm looking in there  I'm probably looking at her  And I'm an asshole  I never  Was like  Please let me into Canada 
[00:54:30]  I am like  You know  Fuck that  Man  I'm not  Signing shit  But  Then  America has to treat you like shit  Patrice  What was the  What did they actually  Want you to sign  You're not sure what it was  It  I  It was a  I had to agree  That I was a ripist  A ripist  I had to  I had to  Sign  Because when I gave them  The paper  They gave me a piece of paper  To  And when I gave the guys  That they gave me  Two pieces of paper 
[00:55:00]  One  The Canadian consulate  And  And now  This is what I have to do  To  To come back to Canada  Ever again  Is go down to the consulate  And bring  Transcripts  First of all  Five years  Have to go past  It's been 25 years  And so  You know  A 20  23 years  And  Five years  Have to go past  You have to get  The transcript  The court transcript  You have to get  All the shit 
[00:55:30]  From the court  You have to get  Something from a sheriff  And you have to get  A letter from a clergyman  And  Some law abiding citizen  And  All kind of shit  To go back to Canada  You know  So I probably won't be  Going back to Canada  Ever again  And  And  And  And then the paper  I had to give  To America  And then when I gave  That paper to America  They said  Why did you  Get refused  So it was some kind  Of refusal paper 
[00:56:00]  That I had to agree with  But I'm like  I'm not just  They can't do shit  Cause I  It wasn't  I wasn't committing  No crime  All they can do  Is tell you  And scream  But  But  The thing  The thing is  They could have  Played me nice  If they had been like  Oh we just ask you  But the girl  Was so  Offended  The Swiss Miss girl  Was in complete  Utter shock  I said  I've been here  25 times  Look at your computer  They wasn't on it  She was  And

[01:02:30]  That's when there was only one  Why was there only one  Set of footprints  Set of footprints  Because you weren't allowed  To cross the border  Motherfucker  That's why  Yes  I don't think Jesus  Could carry Patrice  That's what mothers  Can do  That's what mothers  Can do  And then my male friend  You know  We don't have the ability  You know  You're going through that  You're like  Oh man  And then you switch it  To yourself  Like  You know  Oh man  I remember  Like if somebody  If you went through that  I'd be like  Man I remember  When I was at the border  Like all I could do  Is relate to myself 
[01:03:00]  I can't  You know  You just want to  Have somebody go  Fuck that  And you go  Yeah  Fuck that  Thank you  But it was like  It was just  You know  It was one of the moments  But you know  I got through it  Because that's  What did you have to do  So it was like  That situation  Is just  It's just haunting  But it's like  It would be cooler  If I had murder  Even robbery  What did you rob  Oh man  Whoa  It's like  When you hear rip

[01:04:00]  I would be up with this motherfucker  Now fuck with me  But rip  Rip  Goes right through you  If a Mongolian was like  R-up  You'd be like  Oh Jesus  Fuck  Don't say that shit  There wasn't a pack of you  At the time  Was there Patrice  A pack of  No  Just trying to get back  To the Mel Gibson thing  Good old Mel Gibson  Yeah  No no  It wasn't a pack  It wasn't a pack  A pack  Made me laugh  Like a mother 
[01:04:30]  I'm telling you  Even getting raped  By a pack of niggas  Was worth listening  To that cocksucker  That dirty bitch  Out about her fake tits  It just  It just  Made me laugh  And I go  You know what  I'll even let this  Motherfucker say  Rape by a pack  Of niggas  Cause you know something  I almost  In a forgiving way  I almost  Can say to myself  This motherfucker  It was in  Cont  It wasn't racist 
[01:05:00]  It was just  In context  Of cursing this bitch out  And he said  You  You gonna get raped  By a pack of niggas  Dumb whore  In the white world  Like he would have said it  If there was black dudes  In the room  Like you go  Guys I don't  I don't mean you  Just  She's such a whore  It didn't even take me  Out of the  The laughing  One second 
[01:05:30]  It's so brutal  But that's the story guys  That's the border story  That's a big story  Right there  Hey  While we have you  On the phone  LeBron James  Cause we gotta cover it anyway  You and I talked  I don't even know  Oh you were driving  To Canada  When we were talking  You were on your way  Yes I fucking was  I killed an hour  With you  On the phone  I killed an hour  With Patrice  Made it a little easier  Did you call him  Or did he call you  He called me  That's what he does  I called him  You know why I called him 
[01:06:00]  Believe it or not  I was listening to  The best of replay  Going down  And  And  Opie said something  About Bobo  Being as boring  As watching  A  A video buffering  And I laughed  Hard  As fuck  I said I gotta call  This fucker  And just say  Video buffers  That made me laugh  He called me about that  But then we talked  About LeBron  For about an hour  And LeBron  Patrice's take on LeBron  Is the best take 
[01:06:30]  It's the best take  Look LeBron  I don't  You know  If you're a basketball fan  You don't have to be  There's too many levels  I'll go  The first level  Is your own  Personal  Investment  My own  Personal investment  Of disappointment  For LeBron  And then  This is as far  As it goes  And then the rest  Is just  You know  Little different things  Back and forth  There's like a million of them  He  You know  I've been a basketball fan  My whole life  Michael Jordan 
[01:07:00]  And Larry Bird  And Funk and Magic Johnson  They would have never said  I'm not gonna ever win a championship  Unless I join forces  With each other  They hated each other  Yep  Fuck you  Larry Bird  And fuck you  Magic Johnson  And fuck you  It was  Larry Bird  Got three rings  Dennis  Larry Bird  Got three rings  Magic Johnson  Got five  Jordan got six 
[01:07:30]  Dr. J  Got one  And they  All of those rings  Have the same value  Because they got them  During the time  When they all hated each other  And they were trying to win  They hated each other  So if you could have  Squeezed one out  During that time  You're still  An all time great  LeBron  Did the seven year plan  And what disappoints me  Is LeBron  People were saying  This guy  May challenge Michael Jordan  He didn't want to be 
[01:08:00]  Michael Jordan  What shocked me  Is that  LeBron wants to be  Scotty Pippen  That's the headline  Right there  Doesn't want to be  The greatest of all time  Just wants to be  You know  Second best on a team  He fucking  Wants to be  Second banana  And win rings  And that  Fucking shocked me  That shocked  Do you think that's just  That he really wants that  Or is it like  One of those things  Where you  Subtly sabotage success 
[01:08:30]  Because you're scared  Of not achieving  It's almost like  Hey if I don't say  I want to  That's just a phrase  Patrice is saying that  Patrice is saying that  LeBron James is  Really a scared guy  Oh I just repeated  What you said  And actually  It was minor  Sorry  He was  He's horrified  Look man  He  You know  He came out  He's a  Physical  Specimen  He's  Godly  He's 6 foot 8  Runs like a  Reindeer  Dribbles  Shoot  He's  As a basketball 
[01:09:00]  Physical specimen  To play basketball  Dude  There's no one  That's ever been  Greater  Just his  Physicality  He's the greatest  Player to ever play  But  I didn't know  I always thought  He had heart  This is why  The Celtics thing  There's a street legend  That one of his teammates  Slept with his mama  Which made  A whole lot of sense  To me  He's a  I think he  He could be  A guy  Look he wasn't  Scared of the Celtics  He used to score  35 points a game 
[01:09:30]  Against the Celtics  No one on the Celtics  They're full of old men  No one could  Make him scared  He gave up  In such a strange  Distant  Spiritual way  That I believe  That  The story  That's in the streets  Is that  Somebody was messing  With his mama  And that would be  His teammate  West  Was supposedly  Having sex  With LeBron James  This is all  Conjecture  And it's all  Yeah no one's  Really touching it  I mean it's here and there 
[01:10:00]  It's on some blog sites  But ESPN isn't covering it  That's for sure  No because it's dangerous territory  But the streets believe it  Trust me  The streets  And people  You ask some black people  But I ask some black people  From Cleveland call  The streets believe that  Because the way he left  First of all  As it's going on  Because it's still big news  Unbelievably  His little thing they did in Miami  Where it was him  Wade and Bosh  Kind of dancing  LeBron dances  Better than that 
[01:10:30]  If that makes sense  He  His spirit  He didn't want to leave  Cleveland like that  There was something  Deeper than what we know  It was some kind of betrayal  That dumb owner  Dan Gilbert  He  Or whatever his name is  This fucker  If he had kept his mouth shut  And had some sophistication  We would still be saying  LeBron is an idiot  And a coward  But now you go  Wait a minute  This is the kind of guy 
[01:11:00]  That LeBron was working for  Wait what did the guy say Patrice  Oh Gilbert's been saying  A lot of shit  A lot of great shit  Here's  The shit he said  When I thought he was emotional  Wait a minute  The shit he said  When I thought he was emotional  Was enough  And I go okay  I'm going to let him get away  Because he's emotional  This motherfucker  Owns big heads  You know big head company  Right  No  It's the  It's the company  That sells giant  Wall stickers  Life size giant wall stickers 
[01:11:30]  Okay  Of different players  Baseball  It's the exact replica  You stick on your wall  You know you buy it for your kids  Whatever  He  Two days later  He lowered the price  Listen to this  Of the LeBron James one  From $99.99  To $17.41  $17.41  Because that's Benedict Arnold's birthday  Holy shit  Oh yeah he is pissed 
[01:12:00]  He's a fucking  Asshole this guy  He's pissed  Dictive  Dirty  Motherfucker  LeBron  Everybody's saying  They're not mad  I'm only mad  Because LeBron  Left the way he left  Look  Cleveland  Is in  Turmoil  LeBron James  Was  He was  Responsible  For a lot  Of Cleveland's  Economy  Dude  Witness  And Nike  And his whole 
[01:12:30]  Presence  For him to leave  Like that  It's something  More than just  I'm gonna go  Play with  Fucking DeWayne  LeBron James  Is a beast  Let me jump in  Because you didn't  Really explain  During the Celtics  Playoff series  He had won  The worst games ever  And you were telling me  On the phone  That he was looking  Around the bench  Going  You know what  All these guys  Knew that  Wes was sleeping  With my mama  Look 
[01:13:00]  When you're a young guy  Look  If somebody  Fuck my mama  One of my friends  Right now  Fuck my mom  I'm at a place  Where I would go  Two things would happen  I would go  Nigga  You hate me  But  You look stupid man  Because  You hate me  And now I know it  And you gave my mother  Some ass  She's in her 60s  So  You did both of us  A favor  She gave us some sex  And  I don't have to  Fuck with you no more  Because you a piece of shit  How many times  Do we have to have  This argument 
[01:13:30]  So  Wait a minute though  So  As a 25 year old guy  First thing you do  Is if you find out  Somebody done  Messed with your moms  You go  Who the fuck knew  Everybody start looking down  Chewing on their nails  And  Looking around  Like  You motherfuckers knew  That this nigga  Was fucking my mother  And you didn't say 
[01:14:00]  Shit  And you told me  He found out  Between game 3  And game 4  You're convinced of that  This is all  Because you see  Of the story  I believe  Game  Makes sense  OP  Well game 3  He had a great game  Right  I don't remember anymore  Game 3  He killed him  And then game 4  Game 3  Boom  Game 4  Game 4  He had one of the worst  Performances of his entire career  Yes  But then  Here's what a beast  He is  Physically  I don't know about mentally  But physically  What's his name 
[01:14:30]  Rajon Rondo  Of the Celtics  Had  What they were calling  One of the greatest  Triple doubles  Of all time  28 points  13 rebounds  16 assists  Some shit like that  The game 6  That they lost  In Boston  LeBron  Had  28 points  12 rebounds  10 assists  He had one of the greatest  Triple double games  Of all time  In the playoff  Right  And  And they still call him 
[01:15:00]  Fucked up  He still is so good  He can still cover up  But he  Checked out  Mentally  He's not  He's not afraid  Of anybody  On the court  He checked out  Mentally  And he said  Fuck  Everybody  And don't forget  Another thing  Another thing  He never  Says Cleveland  Ever  He only says  Akron  So  He might not  Give a shit  About 
[01:15:30]  Ohio  He only talks about  Where he's from  He never goes  Hey I love Cleveland  When he has little  Things that he has to do  He goes back  To Akron  Right  He don't go  He accepted  His MVP trophy  In Akron  At Akron High School  He big  He bigs up  Where  He went to  High school  Not Cleveland  He wears  New York hats  He wears  Dallas Cowboy hats  LeBron  The painful thing 
[01:16:00]  He might not  Give a shit  About Ohio  And let me tell you man  It's just like  When I meet a guy  And he says  I married my high school  Sweetheart  And I'm from like  Portland, Oregon  I go  Are you a fucking retard  That you used to eat  Potato puffs with  You fucking clown  Leave  Leave your state  You live about  Four states from California  You fucking  Ninkum  He's been  Fucking  Weird  Look  Hot Cleveland girls 
[01:16:30]  Have trouble  Competing with  Ugly Miami  Bitches  It is a good point  He's been photographed  With the Yankees  Hat on  And I think  You're onto something  That he never really  Cared about Cleveland  And couldn't wait  To get out of there  I think Cleveland  Is just pissed off  How he did it  Making a big  Big to do about it  With that hour special  On ESPN  And telling him  That way  That he's leaving  Their fine city  Explain to me  What he owed  Oh he doesn't owe 
[01:17:00]  Shit  Trust me  I get that  What did he do  That you know  Because I can't  Be as mad  As I  I'm trying to put  Myself in a Cleveland  But what did he do  That made  That makes them  So mad  If they're honest  There was no way  He could have left  And they'd been happy  Now  But I think  It shows  Hold on  I think it shows  A lack of class  I think he should  He should have been  He should have been  Low key  A lot of guys  Are low key  When they change teams  And just a low key thing 
[01:17:30]  This was a big event  On ESPN  With stupid Jim Grain  His dumb  Ten questions  Or whatever it was  It was a little bit  Hokey  But let's say  If he said  Hey Dan  I'm gonna  I'm gonna actually  Try my hand  In another situation  And  And  And then  Say a little small thing  Like hey  Cleveland thank you  For everything you've done  For  Cleveland people  Still be taking  Shits on his jersey  It was the same fury  Yeah they burned his jersey  They had to hire 
[01:18:00]  A construction company  To take down  All the shit  All the LeBron shit  He had  Look  When I flew in the  When you fly into Cleveland  You see  A LeBron picture  Yeah you do  Oh yeah  From the air  You can see that fucking thing  It's giant  You know what though  Fuck Cleveland  And fuck him  And fuck Miami  And Dan Gilbert  And betrayal  Like this is a fucking  Military operation 
[01:18:30]  It's some cocksucker  That throws a ball  Through a hole  And fuck Dan Gilbert  If Michael Jordan  Was in his prime  And he said  You could have  One or the other  He would have  Taken his shit  In LeBron's mouth  And taken Jordan  Fuck all these guys  And I agree with that too  That's what I'm saying  I'm not angry  I can't be that  But the message here  Which Jimmy has touched on  Many times on the show  We take our sports teams  Way too fucking seriously  And then you learn  Through the LeBron James situation  They don't take  What team they're on  Serious enough 
[01:19:00]  Not as serious as you take it  That's why I'm Billy Bandwagon  And I'm going out  To get my Miami Heat jersey  And I'm going to start  That's my new favorite team  I'll tell you right now Patrice  I've openly admitted  I haven't followed the NBA  In the last few years  I am all in starting  This fall  I can't wait to hate  On the Miami Heat  If they get a center  If they get a center  With one leg  They'll win 80 games  You know what  They have to win  The championship  And if they don't win  That fucking championship 
[01:19:30]  I'm going to be laughing  Big time  And they will  Because LeBron  They will win  Because the argument was  Oh shit  What are they going to do  Share the ball  LeBron James  Left  To become  Second fiddle  To be Scottie Pippen  That is a fucking fact  I agree with you there  And one thing  With your theory  About him hating Cleveland  And his teammates  And all that  And having that  Horrible game  In the playoffs  Remember when that  Series was over  The shot they showed  Many many times 
[01:20:00]  Was LeBron  Walking off the court  And ripping that  Cavaliers jersey off  That wasn't about  Ripping it off  That wasn't about  Losing that series  That was about  Fuck everyone  I'm out of here  And this is the last time  You're going to see me  In this fucking jersey  Fuck everybody  And if you look at that shit  He walked up to  Kevin Garnett  And if you don't know  His story  He was loyal to  Minnesota for many years  He's only 32 years old  But he's been in the league  For 16 years  Because he came in  He's 32 
[01:20:30]  He's been in the league  14 years  He came in when he was  18  And LeBron ran up to him  Gave him a hug  And they talked for a minute  Kevin Garnett said  In the press conference  Right after that game  And he goes  Look man  If I knew  What I knew now  Then when I was 25  In my prime  I'd have left Minnesota  A long fucking time ago  A long  I had a terrible dream  One day  That I was talking  To fucking Leno  I know it was somebody  It was Patrice Day 
[01:21:00]  I was famous  And he said  I'm sure Leno's  Had the same nightmare  Rip  Rip  Rip  Rip  Rip  And in the fucking  In the fucking dream  I said  He goes  How did you get famous  I said  When I became disloyal  When I became a guy  Who didn't think about  Other people  Then fame comes  Kevin Garnett  Said the same thing  He said  Man if I'd have knew this  I'd have told loyalty  To eat my asshole  Years ago 
[01:21:30]  Because I was staying  Loyal to suckers  And LeBron  Made that move  Based on  Guys  Who are  32 year old men  And 33 year old men  And not a 25 year old  Basketball machine  Who could have won  One  His one  Championship  In Cleveland  Would have been huge  Huge  He wouldn't have needed  Another  Championship  Ever  He would have the key  To the city for life  And you gotta throw this  Into the equation 
[01:22:00]  I think Cleveland  Went 61 and 21  Last year  I believe  They were pretty close  The year before  They were pretty close  To winning a championship  Maybe  In the offseason  To get another player  And they would have been  Right there again  So it wasn't like  He was leaving  A team that sucked  He just not  He wants other guys  To play  Listen  He got  Dwayne Wade  Who is  He's arguably  The third best player 
[01:22:30]  He's  Kobe's one  LeBron's one B  And fucking  Dwayne Wade is two  In terms of the best player  In the league  He is a beast  I mean a beast  And he likes to win  He beat Dallas  By himself  And when they won  That championship  Man  Cause Shaq  Was breaking down  At that time  All he needed  Was half a Shaq  And he won  A championship  Man  LeBron  Is  You know  He made the right move  In terms of  Going with the right person  But for his legacy 
[01:23:00]  For who we thought he was  For all the props  That we  We gave him  He made a bad  Fucking move  Do you think  Let me ask you a question  Do you think  There was a move  That he wanted Cleveland  To make  You guys are much more  Basketball  Knowledgeable than I am  Yeah  Amari Stonemeyer  The guy that's in  New York  In New York  In Gilbert  He had a guy named  J.J. Hickson  On the bench  That he looks  He looks at  For the future  J.J. Hickson  Could be good  In three years  He could be great  Amari Stonemeyer 
[01:23:30]  Amari Stonemeyer  Is a bona fide  Beast  Right now  Beast  The guy that's in  New York  That New York sign  Bonafide  Will dunk it  In your fucking face  Any chance  He gets  Kind of guy  LeBron  Could have got him  Dan Gilbert  Wouldn't give up  J.J. Hickson  For Amari Stonemeyer  He got  The guy  Antoine Jameson  From Washington Wizards  Instead  Who is serviceable  So he has a  He has a  He's a serviceable guy  But he's not a legitimate  Number two 
[01:24:00]  He needed a legitimate  Number two  Who is really  Has the one mentality  Like a  Like a really  Amari was that guy  Amari was a guy  You dump it down to him  And he go  And you go  You unleash him  Like a fucking pit bull  And  And LeBron  Could smile  And he doesn't  Have to beat you  But  See the great ones  Wanted to beat you  By themselves  LeBron  He got scared  And he was on the  Jordan game plan  Which is seven years  But Jordan 
[01:24:30]  If it took him  Twenty years  He'd have won  A fucking championship  He just  I think it took  I didn't realize  LeBron was  Was that guy  Didn't it take Jordan  Six years to win  With the Bulls  I think  It took him seven years  Seven years  So six years  Where he was  And he  And he won in 91  And the thing is  It's not like  Jordan  Had that game plan  Jordan  Wanted to win  Day one  It's the seven year plan  Jordan hated  The seven year plan  But Bill Russell won 
[01:25:00]  Every year  Since he was in the league  For 13 fucking years  So  Jordan wanted that  He ended up winning it  Because he got  Scottie Pippen  And he got this  Triangle system  And that's the same thing  That happened to Kobe  He got the triangle system  He got a couple of good players  Years to be 30  Alright listen  Cause we gotta move on  To other things  But I do want to ask you  About the Jesse Jackson thing  Which  And you heard  The Jesse Jackson thing  I'm gonna sleep on that one  I know he called this thing  He called Dan Gilbert 
[01:25:30]  A slave owner  And LeBron's not a slave  And blah blah blah  Blah blah blah  Well  I mean look man  I think  The sad thing is  When you're dealing  With race  Racial issues  Right  A guy like Jesse  Has  You  Even if he makes sense  He's used  Up  White people  Automatically  I don't want to listen  To fucking  If he even says  Something that's legitimate  Right  If I look at  Dan Gilbert  The argument 
[01:26:00]  Beyond race  Is the ownership  Of the team  Which is  You will fuck  Anybody  You can fuck  To get your way  And  Why are you on  LeBron  Talking about  Disloyalist  First of all  First of all  As an owner  He's like  We did everything  You're supposed  To do everything  Of course  That's your job  For the greatest player ever  That's your job  Mr. Owner  You're supposed  To build a team  To win a championship  So set the fuck up  But the 
[01:26:30]  The thing I think  Jesse's talking about  Is  Is living  With the  Arrogance  Of white people  And this is  One of the most  Arrogant parts  And this is what I learned  Getting in trouble  When I was young  The white system  You know  You take away  You know  You're white  And you're white  It's a system  It's a system  When black people  Say white  And the system is  Nigga  I don't give a fuck  How you really feel  Just smile  And be grateful 
[01:27:00]  That's  That's the system  Well let me read  So  That's it  Yeah let me read  What Jesse said  About Dan Gilbert  He's an asshole  Exactly  Let me listen to it  With black ears  Let me listen  Take the stolen  iPod buds out  That was my racial joke  Well Dan Gilbert  Said that LeBron leaving  It was cowardly  Betrayal  Or something like that  Right  So Jesse  The big quote in this  Is  His feelings of betrayal 
[01:27:30]  Personify a slave master  Mentality  He sees LeBron  As a runaway slave  This is an owner  Employee relationship  Between business partners  And LeBron  Honored his contract  Well of course  I have Jesse's right  But you're not  No he's not right  About the slave owner  To bring in the  Slave master  Mentality  It's like  Fuck you Jesse Jackson  I'll bring up  Slavery all the time  I agree with Jesse  That's enough  I don't  Look I  You don't want him  To leave  Then fucking  He should have 
[01:28:00]  Hobbled him  I don't agree  With the fucking  She was a true  Slave owner  Yeah yeah  I think  And believe me  I would never  Defend Jesse Jackson  I think the guy  Is a tool  A complete tool  But I think  What he's saying  Is the arrogance  To use language  Like that  As an owner  About betrayal  When it really  Is an employee  I agree with Jesse  But that's fine  But he's  Gotta fucking  Bring the  Slave owner  Mentality  Wait a minute  So Bucky  You're taking it  I don't know  Any multi-million dollar  Slaves  Literally  Well paid slave 
[01:28:30]  The analogous way  To look at it  Is like this  Look  David Stern  Who's the  Commissioner  NBA  Everybody's talking  About how  David Stern  Is not gonna  Let this  Bullshit  Happen again  We're not gonna  Let players  Collude with each  Other  Because this  Is more  Conjecture  Is that  LeBron  Dwayne Wade  And the other  Kid  Mosh  Colluded  To do this 
[01:29:00]  Do you think  That's the first  Time that has  Happened in  NBA history  As  Open  As  Yeah  Because free  Agency  Hasn't been  You know  What it is  I mean  And another  Thing though  Also no  Because Isaiah  Thomas hated  Karl Malone  And what I  Mean by that is  Fuck him  I'm not fucking  Playing with that  Fucking homer  Fuck him  He hit me in the eye  And bust my eye  Open  Fuck that  Motherfucker  Get me some  Unadulterated  Motherfuckers  So I can 
[01:29:30]  Beat that  Bitch  And that's  What they  Used to do  Back then  Now they're  Buddies  They go to  Each other's  Weddings  And it's  It's  You know  It's  Facebook day  Man  Everybody's  A fucking  Friend  And a  Buddy  So  They colluded  Supposedly  Since 2006  After they  Played in the  Olympics  And they  Both  They all  Found out  They love  Sushi  And they  Probably  All  I don't  Know my  Father  The whole  Stupid  Shit  So  They  They just  Said  Well let's  Play together  On some  Young guys  Shit  These guys 
[01:30:00]  Are young  As a  Motherfucker  They're 25  Dude  So  So  I'm  Saying  That  That  The commissioner  Is like  This will  Never  Happen  Again  As a  Black man  As a  White guy  You go  What the  Fuck  You're  Talking  About  As a  Black man  Why  Why  Can't  Niggas  Do  That  It  It  Makes  It  Seem  Like  Oh  When  Niggas  Just  Sit down  And  Three  Motherfuckers  Come  Together  And make  A  Power  Move  In a  In a  Business  That's  Run by  The powers  But now  These three  Young  Niggas  Like 
[01:30:30]  Bumrushed  The league  And made  Some kind  Of  Super  Power  That  They did  It  You know  They should  Be able  To do  That  Fuck  I agree  I agree  They should  Be able  To do  That  If they  Want  If they  Want to  Talk  Behind  Closed  Doors  And try  To figure  This shit  Out  For the  Future  They  Should be  Allowed  They  Absolutely  Should be  Able  To do  That  Because  Nobody  Stops  The  Scumbag  Agent  These  Moves  Are made  Anyway  With  Scumbag  Agents  And  Fucking  Scumbag  Lawyers  I would  Much  Rather  Have  Three  Players  Go  You  Know  What  Fuck  It  Let's  Meet  Up  In  Miami  I would  Much  Rather  Have  That 
[01:31:00]  My  Problem  Is  With  The  Jesse  Jackson  Thing  And  Him  Bringing  Up  Slave  Owner  Mentality  And  Shit  Like  That  That  Fucking  Race  Baiting  Shithead  Will  Bring  Up  The  Slave  Shit  Every  Single  Conversation  Which  To tell  You  The  Truth  Downplays  The  Seriousness  Of  Slavery  Itself  You're  Right  Anthony  You're  Very  Right  That's  Why  I  Say  It's  Like  Look  Race  Is  An  Actuality  There's  There's  Certain  Angles  That  White  People  Just 
[01:31:30]  Won't  Listen  To  They  Look  If  I  Was  White  And  They  And  I  Learned  About  Slavery  Dude  It  Would  Bother  If  I  Was  White  I  Want  Slavery  To  Disappear  To  It  Just  Cause  In  Reality  Once  You  The  More  You  Find  Out  Slavery  The  More  I  Find  Out  Slavery  The  More  I  Go  How  Do  Black  People  Not  Why  Aren't  We  Not  Insurgents  In  America  You  Are  You  Are  We're  Not  Yes  You  Are  A  Couple  Of  Murders  Don't  Make  A  Couple  Of  Rip 
[01:32:00]  Rip  Rip  Rip  It  It  It  It's  It's  Not  We  Not  We  Don't  Do  What  We  Should  Be  Doing  In  Terms  Of  What  We  Went  Through  Slavery  Is  It  Still  Means  Can't  Organize  A  Fucking  Block  Party  Without  18  People  Being  Shot  You  Gonna  Get  An  Insurgency  Together  I  Know  But  Why  Can't  You  Look  At  It  Right  Here's  The  Problem  That  Black  People  Need  Help  So  As  White  People  Why  Can't  White  People  Look  At  That  Shit  Sometimes  Well  We 
[01:32:30]  That  Shit  But  Listening  To  Jesse  I  Know  What  The  Fuck  He's  Talking  About  It's  Just  That  This  Motherfucker  Still  Has  The  Lingo  Of  19  He  Still  Has  He 
[01:33:00]  Still  Called  White  People  Honky  But  For  Him  To  Go  After  Dan  Gilbert  Don't  You  Think  All  The  Owners  Are  Quote  Slave  Owners  Then  I  Like  To  Make  This  Point  And  That  The  Point  You  Just  Made  Is  When  Raw  Raw  What's  The  Guy  Everybody  Says  An  Asshole  The  Radio

[01:39:00]  I  Don't  Know  If  You  Had  Anybody  In  Your  People  Might  Have  Had  Some  Influence  Over  LeBron  And  LeBron  Just  Wanted  To  Make  His  Own  Decision  Or  He  Fucking  Hated  Dan  Gilbert  Those  Are  The  Two  Things  You  You  Could  Have  Maybe  He's  A  Weak  Guy  And  It  Would  Have  To  Say  No  To  People  So

[01:42:30]  news though  I want to  throw in  a buddy  of mine  very very  close friend  to Collins  was killed  really nice  dude  you knew him  Bobby  yeah  I did  not nearly  as well  Robert Spillane  right  or Bobby  Spillane  yeah yeah  he was a  really really  sweet guy  and he  fucking  fell to his  death  man  I heard  about it  I just got  a message  yesterday  because I  was away  when I  got home  I just  listened to  my voicemail  Mickey  Spillane's  son  son yeah  and what  happened  he was  leaning up  against a  screen  that was  on a  door  or something 
[01:43:00]  I don't  know  he had  his arm  in a  sling  for a  while  and Colin  was  like I  wanted to  I think  produce  something  with him  but he  just  couldn't  it was  hard for  Bobby  to  rehearse  because  his  arm  was  fucked  up  and  apparently  he was  leaning  on  something  and he  just  fucking  fell  without  his  left arm  or his  arm  to  brace  himself  that's  what I've  heard  I read  in the  daily news  and he  was found  on the  sidewalk  I think  it was  like  six  stories  up 
[01:43:30]  8th  Avenue  and I  heard of  some  kind  of  screen  that he  was  leaning  against  and it  all  just  gave  out  and he  fell  to  his  death  he was  probably  leaning  on his  good  arm  and then  when it  went  through  he just  didn't  have  his  bad  arm  to  fucking  brace  to  grab  something  but Colin  was  really  close  to him  so that  stinks  he was  a fucking  very nice  dude  man  really nice  guy  gruesome  yeah  that sucks  wow  where do we  go from  here  yeah I  know  I probably  should have  picked it  better  I just  have the  paper 
[01:44:00]  in front  of me  how about  we end  the show  with that  and we'll  see you  tomorrow  and then  dramatic  like you  know  silence  for a while  and then  we'll go  into some  duty promo  and move  on to  Ron and  Fez  that's the  way to do  that type  of thing  Jimmy  I know  I just  can't  do them  at the  end  I can't  do it  like it's  a special  episode  of different  strokes  I just  when are  we seeing  Colin's  one man  show  that's  what I'll  say  I don't  know  because I'm  hearing nothing 
[01:44:30]  but great  things about  this one man  show  a lot of  people seeing  it a lot  of people  in the  biz  a lot  of fans  and everyone  is saying  how great  it is  Colin and  Florentine  both have  one man  shows  I've seen  two of my  closest friends  I've seen  neither of  them  so I don't  know  but I heard  Jonathan saw  both recently  so they're  both unbelievable  you know  Danny's got a  great idea  is it the  Sandy Kane  thing  alright yeah  this will get  us out of  the sadness  that Jimmy  just brought  to everybody  it's the  Chris Russo  vs Sandy Kane  farting promo  I guess  we could call  it 
[01:45:00]  it's quick  what  exactly  yeah  okay  this will  bring us  back  and then  we'll get  into the  Mel Gibson  tapes  tape number  two  I'm hoping  there's a  tape number  three  I'm hoping  I'm telling  you  the way you  hear the  tape number  two end  there's a  tape  three  you know  what  you're  absolutely  right  because I'm  thinking to  myself  why would  it just  end there  very abrupt  tape three  tape three  on the way  coming up  spicks  kikes  and niggers  from Mel Gibson  tape three  he already went 
[01:45:30]  after the blacks  the women  and the Jews  so  yeah  yeah you're right  who really is  left in Hollywood  especially  you know  faggots and spicks  part four  Mel Gibson  what a naughty  boy Mel is  Mel's fresh  but first  but first  this  and now  here's  Chris Russo  and Sandy  Kane  in a room  together  farting  gee whiz  that's great  come on

[01:47:00]  obvious when we  need to stop  this thing  the Mel Gibson  tapes  uncensored  you get to  look as  as I look up  there you go  censored all over  TV because they  can't play the  naughty shit  F dash dash dash  is what they do  F dash dash dash  F dash dash dash  sucks  here we go  stay on this phone  and don't hang out  for me  I can  I have plenty  of energy  to drive over there  you understand me  and I will  that is one of my  favorite parts  that's great 
[01:47:30]  oh is he angry  oh poor dummy  I tweeted yesterday  that a lot of people  one time in their  lives  have felt exactly  like Mel Gibson  sure  is feeling  in these tapes  I'm not saying  it's right  but a lot of us  have felt  just like this  that enraged  this is every  relationship I've ever  been in  that period of time  where you can't  even breathe on the  phone  I fuck a girl  right after I  yell at her like  this  yes  I'm not saying 
[01:48:00]  it's right  but yes  women will do  that to you  they will enrage  you  well yeah  but wow  you'd think  you'd just hang  up and take a  breath  with Xanax  or something  well we all  can't be like  you  some of us  really have  emotions  that we have  to get out  there  we really have  to let it  out  really  oh yeah  we do  stay on this phone  and don't hang  out for me  I can  I have plenty  of energy  to drive over  there  you understand  me  and I will 
[01:48:30]  so just  fucking listen  to me  I gotta stop  it again  I don't know  I will  you know what  I don't  angry  we have so much  other shit  to do today  I don't think  we're gonna get  to anything  and I will  it's almost  as if  someone is  sitting there  going  I bet you  won't  the voice  in his head  I bet you  won't go  I will  can we  hear that  again  I think  there's a little  voice I heard  the tape  has to be  turned up  a little  okay  I'll turn  it up  here 
[01:49:00]  and here  we go  stay on  this phone  and don't  hang out  for me  I can  I have  plenty  of energy  to drive  over there  you understand  me  no you won't  and I will  so just  fucking  listen to me  listen to my  fucking  ranting  listen to what  you do to me  I didn't do  anything to  you  she's reading  her lines  huh  no she's  she's a stiff  russian  and to me  she's just  it's the way  she's recorded  them  but she knows  that she's  going to goad  him into being  this angry  but again 
[01:49:30]  he's just  an angry guy  I think  and if  she sounds  very calm  and reasonable  on the phone  she knows  that he's  going to  sound like  the complete  lunatic  that he  sounds like  right  yeah  she's got  a little  blame  in this  whole thing  no  yeah  sitting there  fucking  taping it  knowing  you know  you're going  to get  some good  stuff  and then  you're  going to  pass it  on to  the media  now  we're  going to  be called  misogynistic  assholes  again  I can't  believe  you're  taking  the side  of Mel  Gibson  over this  who doesn't  know Mel  Gibson  is in a 
[01:50:00]  kook  all right  who thought  for a second  this man  isn't a  kook  look  but throw  it all  on the  table  maybe  maybe  she had  it with  him  you know  yeah  and said  you know  what  I'm going  to fucking  tape this  asshole  there you  go  we're  back  we're  back  in  yeah  women  love  us  again  okay  good  you  are ruining  my life  you make  my life  so fucking  difficult  well you  know  what  it's  a woman  that  fucking  supports  me  instead  a woman  that  sucked  off  me  and just  fucking  sucks  me  dry 
[01:50:30]  and wants  and wants  get out  of this  relationship  if you're  a good  woman  and you  love me  I don't  believe you  anymore  what am I  what did  you say  of your  bullshit  has any  relationship  ever worked  with you  no  wow  by the way  this is the  discussion  if Opie and  Anthony ever  break up  this is the  conversation  fuck you 
[01:51:00]  you're hard  to work  with  fuck you  you're the  one who's  divorced  I don't  have a  fight in  me  I don't  have that  fight in  me  but when  you hear  this  fucking  this  argument  even  though  he's  an idiot  and he  probably  did  belt  her  don't  you  don't  you  fucking  hear  a guy  who  is  like  so  frustrated  that he  thinks  he's  being  made  a fool  and I'm  not  saying  he's  right  but this  does  not  sound  to  me  like  a guy  who  wants  to  beat  the  shit  out  of  a woman  this  sounds  like  a guy  who  is  just  being  humiliated 
[01:51:30]  by a woman  sure  yeah  he's  reacting  I think  wow  yeah  definitely  reacting  we all  at least  admit  this is  really  funny  though  my  dick  is  funny  it's  really  funny  my  favorite  part's  coming up  by the  way  what's  your  favorite  part  what's  your  favorite  part  my  favorite  part  is  when he  goes  listen  for  so far  my  favorite  part  is  and  I  will  because  it  was  so  childlike 
[01:52:00]  I  dare  you  I  like  the  part  where  he  talked  about  her  friend  and  how  she's  not  a  real  friend  that  is  a  good  one  I  like  when  he  wants  her  to  get  raped  in  the  first  tape  the  sequel  is  good  but  I  prefer  the  original  I  like  to  think  that  Mel  Gibson  doesn't  have  to  put up  with  this  shit  but  it  turns  out  he  has  to  put  up  with  this  shit  he  has  to  put  up  with  this  shit  Mel  Gibson  right  why are you  putting up  with this  you're the punchline  when everyone  goes  what do you think  I am 
[01:52:30]  Mel Gibson  why don't you  go out and  fuck Mel  Gibson  you're the  guy  everybody  references  for a  woman  to  fuck  and  there  he  is  just  miserable  and  yelling  Kevin  from  Connecticut  yeah  he's  got  his  favorite  part  is a lot  of  people's  favorite  part  I don't  want to  blow it  in case  people haven't  heard it  yet  because  it is  a classic  line  is that  where he  fucking  calls Danny  Glover  a yum  that was  totally  uncalled  for  I had  to sit  in the  car  with  that  black  motherfucker  here we

[01:56:30]  gonna  have a  stroke  is he  jerking  off  he's  gonna  have  a  fucking  stroke  dude  he  sounds  like  an  alcoholic  to  me  this  to  me  sounds  like  the  rantings  of  a  guy  who  is  a  drunk  I  mean  it  sounds  like  that  unless  he's  just  a  dry  drunk  or  I  don't  know  man  that's  my  opinion  of  it  but  god  I  would  get  drunk  and  this  is  how  I  would  talk  really  you  just  yell  does  he  sound  drunk  no 
[01:57:00]  no  no  no  I'm  talking  about  the  level  of  anger  not  necessarily  the  or  the  irrational  is  that  what  you  mean  by  a  dry  drunk  yes  okay  you  don't  care  you  don't  care  you  just  enjoy  insulting  me  that's  all  I  didn't  do  anything  I  did  not  do  anything  and I  apologized  for  nothing  I  did  not  do  anything  and I  apologized  for 
[01:57:30]  nothing  what  that's  my  favorite  part  what  he  does  it  a lot  now  what  you're  a  fucking  liar  what  what  what  the  Christ  what  the  Christ  I  fucking  love  it  let's  include  the  listeners  a little  bit  they've  been  waiting  days  to get  involved  with  this  one  Matt  in  Connecticut  what's  up  Matt  hey  boys  you can  tell  throughout  that  rant  that  Mel  Gibson  is  just  an  amazing  actor  he's  just  pulling lines 
[01:58:00]  from like  every movie  he's ever  made  is there  is there  actual lines  from movies  in there  I don't  I don't  remember  I think he  actually does  one of  Danny Glover's  lines  he goes  I'm too  old  Vinny  shit  there's  there's  the joke  Vinny  in Brooklyn  Vinny  yo guys  you missed  the obvious  Vince McMahon  does he sound  like Vince McMahon  not really  no  it's not the obvious  sir 
[01:58:30]  alright  alright  one more  and then we'll  move back  to the tape  Victor in  Chicago  Victor  doesn't he  remind you  of that guy  on YouTube  yelling at his  fucking cat  yes  that  sounds like  that I can see  and the reason I took  your phone call  because obviously  we're gonna go into  remix mode here  where you take the  Mel Gibson tapes  and mix it into shit  and that would be a  perfect one  Mel Gibson versus  the guy that yells  at his cat  how about Mel Gibson  gets angry at Terry  Schiavo  yes  yes  Mel Gibson 
[01:59:00]  gets mad at  Terry Schiavo  game on people  game on  one for the  creative listeners  out there  start sending in  your Mel Gibson  remix audio  and we'll definitely  play the better ones  on the show  alright let's get  back to this  nothing  I did not do  anything  and I apologized  for nothing  what  what  you apologized  for nothing  or then you're  a dishonest  cunt  is it bad 
[01:59:30]  we're laughing  no  do we've all  had these arguments  I have  I've had them  in every  relationship  every  at least Mel  had the fucking  the guts to throw  a punch  I just talk shit  but I'd listen to this  I'm not gonna laugh  Jesus Christ  sorry  they'll put that  on fucking  they'll put that  on Breedbart  and just quote me  seriously  but I hear this  stuff and I  openly laugh  and then I think  to myself  what's wrong 
[02:00:00]  with me  but other people  are laughing  right  hilarious  this is ridiculous  how outrageous  this is  the thing is  we're laughing  at a guy's  misfortune  is it black comedy  yes of course  it is  we're making  fun of a guy  but we're also  admitting hey look  we've all had  these dumb fights  the media  we're not expressing  phony outrage  like the media does  that's the difference  we're making fun of it  while me and Ann  were watching  two women anchors  going over the tape  I guarantee  and there wasn't  a smile on their face  and I'm thinking  okay this is some  crazy material  obviously 
[02:00:30]  but this is some  funny ass shit too  two women anchors  what were they  two women on comedy shows  fucking cunts  smile a little  why don't you  I'll knock out  two of your teeth  then we'll see  again the teeth joke  bumps  no I like the anchor one  sorry  maybe the boys  down the hall  could get the  two women anchor  anchors  anchor  the anchor women  who's the second one  is Lacey Peterson  and who  well  you know  anchor  water  stop 
[02:01:00]  stop  screaming  I wanted to peace  I wanted to have peace  because  keep peace  because you're unbalanced  good enough for me  and instinctively  I feel that  you're unbalanced  be patronized  by you  you're unbalanced  you need medication  because you know  you're wrong  you need medication  that's all I'll accept  and if you will not  fucking admit that  get the fuck out 
[02:01:30]  and I will make  your goddamn life  miserable  alright  you need medication  what  what  there's the what  again  that's my favorite part  you need medication  what  what  and he heard her  what  by the way  how happy  is Mel Gibson's  ex-wife  and what a  con he hooked up with  Mel's ex-wife  is fucking herself  with a rolling pin  to this audio  how great is this  for her  he left his ex-wife 
[02:02:00]  and I think  like ten kids  they had together  whatever it was  they had a lot of kids together  you know how many times  she's probably been  yelled at like this  oh my god  oh you deal with this  you little fucking  you little Moscow whore  you deal with it  you little minx  Russian minx  alright  you need medication  what  you need medication  I need a woman  not a fucking little girl  with a fucking dysfunctional cunt  a cunt is dysfunctional 
[02:02:30]  uh oh  uh oh  oh the  what does that mean Mel  wow  girl with a fucking  dysfunctional cunt  I need a fucking woman  I don't need medication  you need a fucking bat  in the side of the head  alright  oops  well maybe they're both right  you need a bat  in the side of the head  and that's the reason  right there  why the LA police  want the tapes  mmhmm 
[02:03:00]  they can't get them  on anything  can they  what  cause that's a threat  he's saying she needs it  he's actually offering  a suggestion  maybe he thinks  that she needs a bat  in the side of the head  who said it's a baseball bat  could have been a little  flying animal  yeah  could be his penis  that would be nice  we've all said that  I hope you die  you need to be  I guess it's a weird  kind of around the  around  uh roundabout threat  you need a fucking  you need a fucking bat  in the side of the head  alright  how about that  you need a fucking doctor 
[02:03:30]  you need a fucking brain transplant  you need a fucking  you need a fucking soul  I need medication  I need someone  who fucking treats me  like a man  like a human being  with kindness  who understands  what gratitude is  because I fucking  bend over backwards  with my balls  with my balls in the knot  to do it all for her  and she gives me shit  like a fucking sour look  or says I'm mean  the fuck is that  this is mean 
[02:04:00]  get it  you get it now  what mean is  get it  you fucking don't care about me  I'm having a hard time  and you fucking yank the rug  you bitch  you fucking selfless bitch  don't you dare  hang up on me  I can't listen to this anymore  you hang up  I'm coming over there

[02:08:00]  makes a point  Mel's just gonna be  a dick about it  could be the greatest  laugh ever  oh this guy  has definitely  done this before  oh dude  yo you're awful angry  for this  you almost killed us  did you forget  life three years  has been a fucking  gravy drink  we were hitting a woman  with a child  in her hands  you  what kind of man  is that  hitting a woman  when she's holding  a child in her hand  breaking her teeth  twice in the face 
[02:08:30]  what kind of man  is that  oh you're all angry now  you're gonna get to  you know what  you're gonna answer  one day boy  you're gonna answer  huh  what  what are you threatening  nothing  nothing  I'm not the one  to threaten  I'm threatening  I'll put you  in a fucking  rose garden  you cunt  he's still a romantic  he promised  you a rose garden  isn't a threat  at least he's still  a romantic  right to the end  I'm going to 
[02:09:00]  buy you flowers  you cunt  and a chocolate box  you can threaten  to bury her  in a garbage dump  but you know  it's a bed of roses  he is Mel Gibson  after all  yeah but he  fucked up there  because he said  you deserved it  it's like when you  it's like he just  admitted that he  fucking whacked her  in her teeth  it seems like  yeah he's  he's done right  in Hollywood  this is it  Mel's done  he had a good career  but then again  yeah  he'll be able  to still make movies  he's fine  because he finances  his own shit  I know  but the theaters  won't run him 
[02:09:30]  Jewish debacle  the theater  you know what  if the theaters  think they're going  to make some money  off of it  they'll run his  fucking movies  nah I'm telling you  this time  if there's a domestic  if they have the  women's groups  coming after them  he'd be  hit his wife  I'm not saying  it's right  but I think  this might be  a tough one  to come back from  I think so  we might have  finally found  something you  can't come back  from  nah  because he's  already gone  on a meme  you think he  comes back  dude there was  that whole  Jewish sugar  tits debacle 
[02:10:00]  with the cops  and all that  crap  and then he  put out that  fucking movie  that made all  kinds of money  Apocalypto  yeah Apocalypto  it was fine  you know  he financed it  himself  he didn't need  any of those  pesky Jews money  and that was it  it's true  Roman Polanski  can still make  Roman Polanski  fucked a 13 year old  up the butt  and he can still  make movies  and Mel Gibson's  blackball  that's not fair  hero  but no one cares 
[02:10:30]  because she grew up  to be an ugly broad  was that it  Roman fucked  the pretty right  out of her  when he pulled  his dick out  there was blood  and cuteness on it  and it never returned  he took her hymen  and her cuteness  that's why they didn't  care about him  in the end  ah shit  we only care about  the pretty ones  here's the end  of the tape  backed it up  a little bit  to the Rose Garden  thing  nothing nothing  I'm not the one  to threaten  I'm threatening  I'll put you

[02:16:30]  breaking  news  Mel Gibson  just released  a statement  as far as  why all  this  happened  she  entashed  me  right  we could  do a  remix  with that  too  she  entashed  me  my  entire  life  I'd  love to  know  what  is  making  him  so  angry  he  never  says  it  he  never  says  like  any  instances  of  things  he  calls  her  a  cunt  and  bitch  and  whatever  but  what  was  the  one  thing  that 
[02:17:00]  happened  that  made  him  just  fucking  lose  it  what  does  he  think  she  did  she  not  paying  attention  to  him  she  not  like  what  yeah  what  but  Jimmy  might  be  onto  the  alcoholic  thing  I  think  it's  all  in  his  mind  what  are  you  thinking  no  I  think  that  she's  also  a  bit  of  a  complete  or  bit  of  a  twat  I  can  only  say  this  let's  just  say  in  certain  relationships  I  may  have  a  friend  who  has  had  a  dinner  say  with 
[02:17:30]  another  gentleman  who  may  have  a  child  with  some  women  in  general  like I  say  women  yeah  and  let's  just  say  that  that  person  may  have  said  that  the  woman  he's  talking  about  is  crazy  but  it's  all  speculation  it  really  is  all  speculation  but  a  friend  of  mine  may  have  had  dinner  with  a  gentleman  I'm  not  saying  this  woman  but  who  knows  a  similar  woman  yes  yes  similar  situation  similar  woman  right  and  my  friend's  friend  may  have  said 
[02:18:00]  that  this  woman  who  does  remind  me  somewhat  of  Mel's  chick  is  in  his  opinion  crazy  but  again  that's  all  that's  all  hearsay  all  guessing  games  really  that's  lawyer  speak  she's  Russian  this  one  right  yeah  but  where's  she  going  to  is  the  question  I  meant  nationality  well  Russian  girls are 
[02:18:30]  notorious  for being  a little  unemotional  and a bit  unemotional  at times  a little  detached  Richie  boy  Maryland  Richie  boy  hey  boys  nice  to have  you  back  I  was  going  to  say  two  things  the  first  thing  is  I  have  a  friend  of  mine  also  who's  married  to an  Eastern  European  chick  and  when  there's  conflict  the  first  thing  that  she  does  is  she  gets  a  completely  blank  face  and  she  shuts  down 
[02:19:00]  as if  she  becomes  a  robot  and  no  matter  how  angry  my  friend  would  get  it  makes  him  ten  times  more  angry  that  she's  now  no  longer  responding  to  his  emotional  disturbance  as I  guess I  could put  it  and  it  just  escalates  from  there  she  just  I  guess  is  so  used  to  the  way  she  was  brought  up  over  in  psychotic  Eastern  Europe  really  yeah  that  she  shuts  down  and  like  that's  her  defense 
[02:19:30]  mechanism  but  it  drives  the  person  crazy  on the  other  side  of  that  argument  it's  funny  Pryor  had  an  old  bit  about  how  in  the  manner  you  get  the  calmer  the  woman  gets  and  he  reenacts  screaming  at his  wife  just  infuriating  and it  really  does  drive  you  fucking  nuts  because  you can  tell by  the way  she's  talking  that  he  just  wants  to  oh  my  god  what  does  he  want  to  do  well  there's  obviously  gonna be  a  tape  three  bad  hey  Richie  boy  you also  said 
[02:20:00]  Chris  Brown  this  savage  beats  the  living  tar  out  of  his  girlfriend  in  their  rented  Lamborghini  like  I don't  even know  knocks  teeth  out  of  her  and  smashes  her  face  against  the  glass  and  just  bloodies  batters  and beats  her  and then  he's  back in  the  spotlight  and  all  the  little  girls  are  dancing  and  singing  to his  music  again  Gibson's 
[02:20:30]  ten times  the star  that this  clown  will ever  be  I don't  believe  this  will  affect  Gibson  is  proven  though  there's  a bit  chronic  on his  part  he's  had  a few  incidents  now  and also  Chris Brown  is black  it's looked  at differently  I'm not  saying it  should be  but it  is  and his  fans are  a lot  younger  so they  look at  things  differently  than Mel's  and unfortunately  it matters  because of this  politically correct  faggot country  but Mel  has his  anti-Jewish  statements  anti-black 
[02:21:00]  he has  racist  statements  going in  with it  I'm not  saying that  one should  be better  than the  other  but it  just  simply  makes it  much  harder  for him  he's  54  and a singer  I think  has an easier  time  look at what  rappers do  look at what  rappers get away  with  fucking gun  charges  how many actors  do you know  that are going to  jail for a year  as part of an  initiation process  into a culture  and have fucking  gun charges  it's just the way  it is man  you think  you think  Mel  could play  the romantic  lead again  oh my god  you just can't 
[02:21:30]  picture him  hugging and kissing  a woman  on screen  without thinking  of fuck  blimey  what was the movie  what women want  was it  yeah  oh god  yeah  romantic role  where he has  frank sinatra  playing  he's  oh  you know  he's the guy  that all women  want  proves what a  great actor  he is  that's right  time will tell  you guys are the  best man  peace  good phone call  by the way  yeah what women  want  that was with  Helen Hunt  whatever happened  to her  oh god  she was in 
[02:22:00]  every movie  Helen Hunt  had twins  what  she had twins  that ended  her career  are you  joking  are you acting  I just made  that up  I don't know  if she has  any children  it sounded  so real though  yeah my acting  is getting  better and  better  let me do it  again  we have to  do a second  take  say what  happened  to Helen Hunt  what happened  Helen Hunt  she had  twins  can't do it  twice  you're terrible  I'm only gonna 
[02:22:30]  take one  you're one take  Jimmy  I'm the worst  hey uh  remember we  mentioned the  female anchors  I got it  it's really quick  this is how they  handled the Mel Gibson  as you saw  we handled it  with a lot of laughs  here on the  Opie and Anthony  show  they handled it  very differently  on the news  we were predictably  glib  well how about  this one  Mel Gibson  is saying  more  and it appears  that his mouth  is going to be  his most lethal  weapon here  oh no you didn't 
[02:23:00]  no you didn't  oh you cunt  she smells  yelling at her  yeah  blow me  and it appears  that his mouth  is going to be  his most lethal  weapon here  radar online  released some  new tapes  in which he appears  to make threats  against the mother  of his 8 month  old daughter  and admit  to having abused  her  well it's pretty  serious stuff  these tapes  could land the  actor behind bars  and Craig has 
[02:23:30]  the shocking audio  shocking  yes  very shocking  how is that  really news  though  like  how is that  news  how is it  news  it's a guy  who pretends  to be other  people  yelled  at a Russian  yeah  who gives a  in a private  conversation  who gives a  fuck  really  pretty much 
[02:24:00]  everyone  everyone  yeah  everyone wants  to hear it  it's on every  TV this morning  we do  but what I'm  saying is  the dishonesty  with which the  news gives it  to you  admit what it  is  make fun of  but don't  again  well it's  pretty serious  don't tell me  how to feel  you fucking  cunt  yeah  you're playing  it to  to get  rated  it's a  don't act  like all of a  sudden  it's a serious  story  don't try to  fucking dress  up the pig  you're sending  me  I see what  you're saying  yeah  it's  they're doing  it for their  own benefit 
[02:24:30]  which is  to get you  to watch  a little  longer  you're  absolutely  right  if they heard us  making fun of it  they would say  that's very  tasteless  but we are  using it  for the same  self-serving  entertainment  value  that they are  they're just  spinning it  differently  it's not news  and they don't  even really  discuss it  saying this  was a private  conversation  a lot of  people have  these type  of conversations  and boy  they wouldn't  want that  conversation  out there  like this  one's out  there  you know  what I mean  sure  you go back  to the Alec Baldwin  thing  another private  conversation 
[02:25:00]  I made an  ass  that we weren't  supposed to hear  I would respect  these people  so much more  if they played  this audio  and one of the  anchors said  you know  I was in a  relationship  with a guy  like this  and I know  we don't want  them to  editorialize  and that's  not their  jobs  but unless  they're presenting  the news  completely  unbiased  then it is  their jobs  you understand  what I mean  they're editorializing  subtly  anyway  so if you're  going to  editorialize  at least expose  yourself  unless you're  simply reading 
[02:25:30]  the news  audio  of Mel Gibson  that was  taped from  a private  conversation  has been  released  and here  it is  right  that's  completely  flat  that's  the news  that would  be the  Walter Cronkite  approach  right  but if you're  not doing  that  if you're  subtly putting  your spin  on it  well then  to me  you're  personalizing  it  you're  allowing  your opinion  to bleed  through  don't do  it under  the guise  of impartial  journalism  expose  yourself  holy shit  who's that  Danny  it's me  oh sorry  Jimmy  but Sofia  Vergara  holy shit 
[02:26:00]  giant tits  go to our  boys at  www.tdd.com  for a bikini  picture of  Sofia Vergara  how old is she  with her giant  tits  oh my god  look at those  they're just  too big  oh she's on  Modern Family  I guess  I haven't  watched that  show yet  I haven't  watched Modern  Family  either  but they  are  quite  some  large  yes  took us  right out  of the game  titties just  completely shut  down the show  yeah good point  good point though 
[02:26:30]  Jimmy  here's the second  part with the  female anchors  bantering  okay that is  painful  yeah this is  after they  heard the tape  that is  painful  that is  painful  yeah  I wonder if  she says that  every time a  cop is shot  no  or every time  a fucking  rape is committed  they safely  editorialize  which makes me  sick  that is  painful  okay  well then  how about  the shut  the fuck  up and  blow me  line  that is  funny  how great  would it  have been  if they  came back  after the  tape played  and said  that was 
[02:27:00]  hysterical  you know  there were  some laughs  in there  I'm sorry  people  there's nothing  but laughs  in there  okay that  is painful  to listen to  the sad  thing I mean  you know it's  one thing to  have this happen  between he and  another person  but there are  a lot of  children involved  here  his own  children from  his wife  his ex-wife  and of course  they have an  eight-month-old  daughter  well that was  Ann Craig  reporting  insane  and now these  tapes were  initially handed  over to a judge  in the couple's  custody and  settlement battle  yeah there's 
[02:27:30]  already some  fallout as a  result of this  his talent  agency  William Morris  Endeavor  says that they  will no longer  represent Mel Gibson  this isn't the  first time that his  words have tarnished  his image  back in 2006  he insulted Jews  and now add  blacks and  women  to the list  by the way  by the way  I imagine  they're dealing  with the  Black Panther  party  with the  same  with the  same  harshness  fervor  yes  like  use the word  fervor  I imagine  when they're  saying the  voter intimidation  video  they're making  the same  editorializing 
[02:28:00]  comments  or they're  saying how  they bad  mouth  oh no  they're probably  not doing  that  no of course  not  no  stupid  no one's  paying attention  to it  stupid  news  the administration  is too busy  fucking helping  them not get  prosecuted  yeah exactly  for voter  intimidation  at polling  places  dressed in  paramilitary  garb  with fucking  a baton  back for  the presidential  election  and of course  the black  attorney general  appointed by  the black  president  has decided 
[02:28:30]  that was  there's no  grounds for  charges  but put  again  put a white  guy there  with a weapon  in his hand  dressed in  some type  of paramilitary  garb  and you'll  have a cop  haul his  ass away  for intimidating  the voters  we disagreed  about this  what it was  when it happened  I remember  we argued  about this  but the fact  that fucking  Holder  the administration  cannot deny  that there's a  racial fucking  motive to this  especially after  the shit  everybody in the  media has been  talking about  the fucking  tea party 
[02:29:00]  being racist  and dangerous  and here  fucking  what's his name  Malik Shabazz  fucking Malik Shabazz  admits when we  do something  we tend to do  it stronger  and when  brother  whatever the  guy's  King Amir  Shabazz  whatever the  fucking guy's  name is  some names  I know  how about  just Ted  Shabazz  Ted Shabazz  you take a  Muslim name  I believe  after you  make what  they call  your  Hajj  which is  your trip  to fucking  Mecca  then you  adopt a  Muslim name  but why  has no one  ever just  taken a  fucking  Ted 
[02:29:30]  Shabazz  Ted  Shabazz  Allahu Akbar  get out of the  voting booth  whitey  I'm here  protecting my  brother  there's a  dash in my  name  Jesus  they just  yeah they  won't prosecute  and now they're  looking into  I mean there  was a  there was an  attorney that  that was saying  it was absolutely  racially based  and he's from the  Department of Justice  yes Department of  Justice said that  I was told  to not pursue  this  based completely 
[02:30:00]  on race  he said that  it was very  frowned on  them to pursue  crimes with  black  perpetrators  and white  victims  and how is this  not fucking  I mean it has  been reported  but that is a  fucking bombshell  that's a  fucking bombshell  yeah  and the way  it's being spun  as well you  know he's an  ex-employee  he's disgruntled  like how come  when you're a  fucking and  again not to  always harp on  this but when  you expose  something that  fucking crushes  conservatives  uh you're a 
[02:30:30]  fucking whistleblower  but if you  expose something  that kind of  crushes the  left you're  considered a  disgruntled  employee  by the  fucking  it's just  it's really  annoying  it's beyond  me that  this isn't  getting the  attention either  I mean obviously  Hannity's talking  about it  oh we gotta  play the  Mel Gibson  tapes on the  news  oh yeah  that's much  more important  that's more  important  of course it  is  I was perusing  some websites  last night 
[02:31:00]  let's just  say  and I  did peruse  the new  Black Panther  Party website  and they have  10 goals  10 things that  they want to  achieve  it's crazy  dude it's like  it's just as  crazy as any  of the  Aryan Nation  stuff I've read  on a daily  basis  it's just  yeah their  mission and  their 10 point  platform 
[02:31:30]  they  it's  it's so  separatist  and  racist  and  the  entitlement  they want  they don't  want to pay  taxes  they don't  I know  I know  that's what I  was saying  we would like  things to  continue  as is  no taxes  they want  reparations  they want the  youth to be  reparations  they just  mispronounced it  they're talking  about repairs 
[02:32:00]  for the road  they thought  that was a  fancy word  reparations  you want to  get into the  what is it  called  yes I have to  tinkle  we all do  oh okay  so why don't we  talk about that  after I really  want to talk  about this  website  and do you  guys want to  be the first  ones to  announce that  George Steinbrenner  has passed  away  did he die  fuck  or are you  just guessing  how did he  happen  I guess  God needed  an owner  and an  announcer  Bob Merrill 
[02:32:30]  died as well  recently  yes  well  this guy  I don't know  if he's  reliable  but I think  we have  are we going  for instant  feedback  yes  I'm going to  go with it  I'm going to  go with it  I'm going to  go on the  record and  say I trust  RC in  Tampa Florida  I know what  you're getting  at Jimmy  you want to  make a bet  yes  what do you  got on  you  okay  what I'm  going to  say  what do you  got on  you  I will bet  what do you  got  ten dollars  okay  how about  we  ten dollars

[03:11:00]  new york yankees  owner george  steinbrenner has  died this according  to the associated  press i'm watching  this on breaking  news on cnbc so  uh godspeed to  george steinbrenner  we remember him  many years ago with  his trademark  turtleneck very  full of piss and  vinegar as he used  to say  yelling at  people like  billy martin  reggie jackson  and then crying 
[03:11:30]  the last time we  saw him  back in i think  uh what  late 90s early  2000s that's  about right  when the yankees  won  the world series  george steinbrenner  was weeping  openly  saying  this is the best  team in baseball  and that's when we  knew there was a  problem with george  we should get those  clips together  i know  now we gotta do a  fucking  it's just happened  a death thing  didn't we just do a  death thing for  somebody  seems like every 
[03:12:00]  other day  larry king  almost  is it reporting  that larry king  is dead  too  what happened  poor george  should we sit  back and have  the listeners  congratulate us  on the breaking  news  the scoop  we had  today  i'm thinking  it's what  no  no  well  what  pats on the  back or  something  sure  you want to  go with the  pat on the  back thing  most of the 
[03:12:30]  time people  just openly  laugh at us  but for once  you think  they're not  just opening  openly laughing  at us  i'm gonna wait  i'm gonna wait  for a little  congratulations  to the show  this is  we're having  real news  for once  all official  now right  yes  it's everywhere  they're now  showing  wedgie jackson  yelling at  billy martin  according to  family friend  all right  that's who  we're  yelling at  now  does his  is his  initials  rc 
[03:13:00]  yeah  family friend  oh  look at him  showing the  old clips  the old  mighty george  look at that's  when he was  the prick  he was a  character  look at him  yelling at  each other  he was  he was a  nightmare  firing billy  martin over  and over  again  billy that  drunk  yeah  what was  this like  wrestling  they're doing  like a bit  why are they 
[03:13:30]  yelling at each  other  it really does  look like a  promo  it looks like  i'm gonna  wrestling  you're fired  you're fired  you haven't hired  me yet  oh my lord  that's a good  signing dave  winfield  to an unheard  of  ten year  twenty million  dollar contract  winfield led  the yanks to the  world series  but failed miserably  in the fall  class  getting just  one hit  prompting the  boss to call  him mr  man  the yankees  will lose to  the dodgers  in six games  damn it  and i feel  i let my fans  down 
[03:14:00]  i feel i let me  work down  now if some  other players  don't feel  they let them  down  that's their  own business  i really don't  give a damn  what they think  what a great  honor  on that  i was apologizing  for myself  because i feel  i let new york  down and i don't  like to do that  and i'm not  going to do it  again  ah but it did  happen again  the yankees  playoff run  was over  and george's  frustrations  show  he fired  manager yogi  vera  just 16  games into  the 1985  season  causing  yogi to  stay away  from the  stadium  for 14  years  the team  finally hit  rock bottom 
[03:14:30]  and the fans  started chanting  george must go  the fans got  their wish  in 1990  when commissioner  faye vincent  band steinbrenner  for life  for paying gambler  howie spira  forty thousand  dollars to get  dirt  on dave winfield  the yankees  continue to lose  and finally in  93 george was  reinstated  and the fans  welcomed him  back with  open arms  i didn't know  what to expect  really  but they really  make me feel 
[03:15:00]  good  you know  george's  return  coincided  with the  team's  return  to greatness  in 1995  they made  the playoffs  for the first  time in  14 years  then in 96  he hired  joe tory  to be his  manager  and with the  help of  homegrown  stars like  derrick jeter  and birdie  williams  the team  went on  a magical  run  of four  world series  titles  in five  years  the boss  seemed to  be mellowing  no longer  was he  ripping his  players in  public  he reconciled  with yankee  legend  yogi  barra  who agreed  to return  to the  stadium  and he 
[03:15:30]  wasn't afraid  to show  his emotional  so  here it  is  not everything  changed  though  he continued  to spend  big money  on free agents  and occasionally  the old boss  would reappear  he criticized  the captain  derrick jeter  for his late  night partying  but unlike  the past  they quickly  made up  and even  poked fun  at it  in a commercial  derrick  you're our  starting shortstop  how can you  possibly afford  to spend  two nights  dancing  two nights  eating out  and three nights  just carousing  with your friends  what a great 
[03:16:00]  actor  it's everywhere  you want  to be  in recent years  Steinbrenner's  public appearances  became fewer  and far between  he gave more  and more power  to his sons  and brian cashman  when the yankees  finally parted ways  with joe torrey  it was his sons  who made the  announcement  george got one  last ovation  at the old  yankee stadium  during the 2008  all-star game  showing that  new yorkers  truly love  the man  they call  the boss  80 years old 
[03:16:30]  I mean  what a life  well done  report duke  who survives him  everybody left  on the planet  I like that  to get that  out with a  mouthful  he couldn't  wait  oh it's not  funny  we just stole  like  they probably  worked on that  for a while  so it was  fox 5 here 
[03:17:00]  in new york  the local fox 5  and duke  is the sports  guy over there  he does a  really really  good job  he really does  local sports  guy here  in new york city  I forget his  last name  duke something  thank you  yes travis  we gotta give  them credit  for that  they get  those old  bit clips  together  pretty quick  they had  that ready  to go  oh yeah  that just  needed a little  voice over  that's all  it needed  now ESPN  reporting it  yeah they're  all  who was  first  that is a  fucking  door  who was  first 
[03:17:30]  rc  that's  right  one of  our  listeners  had the  news  first  yeah  all right  that a shame  hey we're  gonna go to  break with  I don't know  Alex Jones  versus the  Opie and  Anthony  show  I have  more breaking  news  oh yeah  from Jordan  in Pennsylvania  it says that  it's not  being reported  just yet  but apparently  Abe Vigoda  is still alive  yeah  he's still  alive right  that's just  amazing  yes he is  he was  the devil  he was old

[03:18:30]  yeah that's  right  89  89 for Abe  hey Alex Jones  was on our show  recently  and Troy Kwan  took the audio  and made this  it's called  Who is Skull  and Bones  a song by  Troy Kwan  it's Alex Jones  versus ONA  I don't even know  if this is good  I have no clue  if it sucks  we'll yank it right  out of the CD player  of course  throw it at him  we're all being targeted  and they are putting  soft kill  binary weapons  in the food and water  they call it  the scientific  dictatorship

[03:20:30]  who is skull and bones  call the O.P. Anthony  show  866  that's 866  969  1-9-6-9  the virus  Sirius XM  you're listening  to O.P. Anthony  O.P. Anthony  first day back  from vacation  and George Steinbrenner  has passed away  at the age of 80 
[03:21:00]  CNN  not reporting  that he's dead yet  even though  everyone else is  their headline is  Yankees owners  suffered  massive heart attack  oh now they're saying  okay I'm sorry  during the break  they still weren't  saying it  peace  judge  I'm trying to think  of what the  New York Post  will put as their headline  because they will have  a giant picture  front page  front page  of George Steinbrenner  and then it's going to be  some kind of  pun  that they always use 
[03:21:30]  with maybe  the boss  because they would  call him the boss  all the time  what do you think  it won't be  snide or shitty  it'll be  it'll be  one of reverence  a pun of reverence  they're going to try  to be clever  yeah I won't put  scumbag dead  fucking  I don't know  it'll be hacky  for sure  yeah it'll be  hacky  it'll probably be  a Bill Gallo  cartoon  oh you think  of that with  heaven  he loves the ones 
[03:22:00]  with heaven  and George  will be heaven  of course he does  he knows he's  heading that way  soon  and like  Mickey Mantle  and Joe DiMaggio  will be waiting  for him  that's probably  what I'm thinking  like all the  Yankees that have  passed  and there's  Georgie  hey we saved  a hot dog  for you  oh yes  that or it'll be  it'll be God  at the pearly gates  and it'll be going  are you coming here  or are you trying  to sign me  you know  or maybe it'll be 
[03:22:30]  George  with a  with a  with a megaphone  dropping the  N-bomb  for no reason  well  Patrice earlier  in the show  yeah  told the story  how he was  stopped at the border  the Canadian border  because of  a rape charge  yes  from his youth  uh-huh  and 
[03:23:00]  we're thinking  we should play  maybe  that story  just to kind of  clear it up  I think  to wrap it all up  because he referenced  the rape thing  because that's why  they wouldn't let him  into Montreal  or they sort of  would have  let him in  if he signed a paper  if you're just tuning in  you should listen  to the replay  I don't think  it was a great story  I don't know  even if he signed  the paper dude  oh okay  yeah I think  the paper was just  him admitting  to something  and saying  that I'm not  coming into Canada  well a lot of people  after Patrice  got off the phone  on instant feedback  and what's not 
[03:23:30]  the Twitter  and everywhere else  uh  they're writing  well what's the  rape story  yeah  and Patrice  told it on our  on our show  so we're thinking  we should play  that right now  yeah  to just bring it  all together  why he couldn't  go to the  Montreal Comedy Festival  because they  they saw  that the rape thing  came up on his record  yeah  something like 20  what did he say  23 years later  rip  so you want to  play that right now  yeah why don't we  do that and clear  things up  all right  Patrice O'Neill  telling telling 
[03:24:00]  this story  we got it out  of him by the way  he I remember  walking out with him  that day  and he said  wow I didn't even  I didn't I didn't  think I was gonna  ever tell that  uh  yeah  story  and he felt  like there  was a  like  a weight  lifted off  his chest  yeah  he felt  good that  he finally  you know  came out  with that  and told  the world  about what  happened to  him when  he was  a youth  yeah  and then  he was  crying  on the  on the  corner  I remember  Jesus  yeah  because we're  walking up  57th  and he was  like  he was just  overcome  with emotion 
[03:24:30]  and had  tears in his  eyes  tears in his  eyes  again  so this  was a  this was a  big moment  for Patrice  and sure  the show  as well  in it  yeah  and it  brings it  all together  why he  couldn't  make it  into Canada  for the  Montreal Comedy  Festival  so let's  check this  out  this has been  the Opie and  Anthony show  catch the replay  starting at 3pm  eastern  the Ron and  Fez show  is next  here on the  virus  Sirius XM  something we  couldn't get to  yesterday  because we  just babble  when we're  supposed to be  doing something  what did we  miss getting to  pregnant 37

[03:29:00]  the right  thing  and call  the police  that's  right  do you know  if you don't  call the police  and you know  about this  you can get  in trouble  I don't  want to see  women go to  jail for  getting young  dick  but I would  like to see  bitches go to  jail for falsely  accusing  motherfuckers  of rape  I would like  to see  do you think  that happens  that much  that you  really need  to make  a  yes  does it  yes  really  yes  do you  have a  story  I mean  I  yes  you really

[03:30:00]  16th  yeah  I was saying  you're lucky  the calendar  had a 19  in the front  right  and it's like  not an 18  or you've been  swinging  out of here  but it's like  she was  in the story  it was bullshit  you know  it's like  you know  yeah  yeah  what actually  happened  what actually  happened is  we was going  to get some  other pussy  bumped into  wow this is  a long  fucking time  holy shit  we was  going to get  wow he's 
[03:30:30]  getting nervous  it's like  he's testifying  it's like  he's on the  fucking stand  well I don't  recall  it happens  that's why  that's why  it's just like  everything  when I hear  Tyson  when I hear  Kobe  immediately  I'm on their  side  right  thinking of  the situation  analyzing what  happened  because to me  right to me  oh  let's all  just take a  swig of water  I need  some water  too  I'm going to  take a little  drink here  I'm getting  dry mouth  as well  oh boy

[03:39:00]  the  process  how'd  you guys  get  off  don't  want to  say  didn't  get  off  you  didn't  didn't  get  off  what'd  you  get  charged  for  I  was  16  she  was  15  did  they  whittle  it  down  to  something  it  was  not  whittled  down  to  anything  because  they  said  you  either  plead  guilty  or  you  go  to  court  we  decided  to  go  to  trial  but  we  admitted  yeah  we  fucked  her  yeah  but  16 
[03:39:30]  15  and  that's  statutory  that was  statutory  that's  it  so  they're  like  time  how long  did you  you did  time  how long  two months  two months  wow  two months  where  Walpole  no  they didn't  send me to  Walpole  no  they sent me  some youth  center  no  no  send two  punk at me  and one of my boys  you went to  big boy prison  big boy  and my boy 
[03:40:00]  went crazy  he lost his  mind  because he  was so  scared  of getting  raped  that he  didn't  he stopped  washing up  he didn't  take showers  and they  started to  throw piss  on him  started to  beat him  up  and they  would come  to me  and go  yo  you know  you gotta  tell your  motherfucking  co-defendant  get his shit  right  how about  I tell  myself  what  myself  has to  do  and I  don't  give a  fuck  and I  was so  scared  because of  the stories  you hear  about that  situation  but it  was a  guy  who ran  a  prison  it  was  these 
[03:40:30]  southern  states  like  south  carolina  was  carolina  this is  so  scary  it was  like  carolina  freaking  out  this is  the first  time  I've ever  talked  about  this  oh  my  god  this is  what  happens  with this  radio  show  you run  out of  shit  to talk  about  you go  well I  guess  I  can  tell  a  story  I've  never  told  before  I'm  choking  back  this is  it  this is  it  this is  the end 
[03:41:00]  of my  career  kind  of thing  or  no  and I  realized  this  because  it's like  people  don't  but  all the  shit  that goes  on  out  here  here's  where I  kind  of  felt  comfortable  in terms  of  this  those  five  guys  and  it  was  an  overcrowded  place  on this  prison  and  I  used to  hear  all day  long  there was  this one  other  guy  that  they  go  that  motherfucker  he  was  in there  for  scalding  his  kid  this  one  kid  guy  was  scalding  his  kid  in the  bathtub  and  that 
[03:41:30]  baby  burning  motherfucker  we gotta  kill that  motherfucker  that baby  burner  over here  talking to  me  he said  hi to  the guy  who  one of  the  southern  state  guys  who  was on  death row  this is  back when  Bill Riley  was on  current  affair  this was  a guy  who was  on death  row  in the  state  that he  was  named  after  I  can't  say  it's  fucking  state  I  know  one  of  them  is  not  South  Carolina  so  that's  why  I  said  but  any  of  those  fucking  states  down  there 
[03:42:00]  so  he  was  on  death  row  I'm  so  all  over  the  place  because  you  don't  understand  man  you  got  the  emotion  yeah  it's  like  even  the  story  is  deeper  you know  it's  just  it's  just  so  fucking  you know  to me  you know  what I  mean  so  I'm  in  jail  we're  corny  I'm  a corny  dude  I'm  a comic  I was  born  a comic  you know  and I'm  a corny  fucking  guy  you know  grew up  in a  gangster  area  but I  used to 
[03:42:30]  make  those  guys  laugh  you know  what I'm  saying  so  I was  in there  because  it was  a gangster  whose name  I'm not  going to  say either  but  what they  did  was  the guy  goes  it was  a judge  who  was  known  for being  lenient  and  he  this is  why I  learned  this  thing  because  he read  a book  he's  like  these  guys  didn't 
[03:43:00]  these  guys  didn't  fucking  do  this  you know  he didn't  force  his way  and the  bitch  was in court  going  and then  they fucking  did this  and then  they did  that  and I'm  sitting there  writing  and he  was just  the judge  was like  saying  I'm very  impressed  with this  I know  this is  bullshit  but  this is  Boston  and they  just wrote  something about  him or how  he's too  lenient on  shit  so  at the  time  I think  the DA  was Maloney  or something  you know  Mick  you know  and so  they ended 
[03:43:30]  up going  this is what  they did  sentenced us  in February  to the  summer  this is what  he said  this is just  to teach  you guys  that  you know  that sex  is not all  about  this  stuff  that you're  doing  we're gonna  sentence you  during the  time of  love  we're gonna  sentence you  during the  time of  love  summertime  just so you  know why  your other  people are  cultivating their 
[03:44:00]  relationships  while girls  are jacking  off with guys  and sucking  their cocks  you'll be in  here  you'll be  inside of  here  as a lesson  kind of thing  and my friend  lost his  fucking mind  he's officially  schizophrenic  he's not  really  because of  this  he was so  afraid  now what  happened is  i used to  be so  funny in  there  that  this dude  one of  the state  guys  and i  would hear  him  talking about  how he's  gonna fuck  up this  baby burner  right  and the  fear  became from  this other 
[03:44:30]  gangster  we said  because no  one was  like ah  you fucking  rapist  they was all  like you  get raped  man get  the fuck  out of  here  so he  goes man  you're  gonna have  trouble  this is  gangsta  outside  you're  gonna have  trouble  man  you're  going in  for a  skin  beef  they call  it skin  you got  a skin  beef nigga  you fucked  up  this is  fucked  up  oh shit  you know  so i'm  going in  and i'm  choking back  tears like  a motherfucker  you know  yeah  and finally  the five 
[03:45:00]  they used  to walk  around  the yard  just five  of these  motherfuckers  it was really  like a movie  slowly walk  around the yard  they go yo  big man  yo fat man  come here man  they ain't even  talk to you  but they were  like country  come here fat man  i go what's  up  man what the  fuck you  in here for  oh shit  i'm walking  with him  i'm telling  him the  story  holy  and i'm  sitting here  like this  because why  they called  me was  why the  fuck is  your 
[03:45:30]  co-defendant  not taking  showers  yeah  why is he  not taking  showers  he's fucking  stinking man  somebody gonna  kill him  yeah  they used to  throw piss  on him  he used to  wear three  pairs of  jeans  never took  his shoes  off  because it  would be  harder  for it  to get  three  pairs  of  jeans  off  right  so i tell  them the story  and i'm just  going i'm gonna  have to fight  i'm gonna have to  do something  this is gonna  be fucked up  finally they  i told them the  story and i'm  just the drum roll  the stabbing 
[03:46:00]  drum roll  where's the  payoff now  they go  what  you in here  for that  shit  pulling a train  nigga  everybody in  this motherfucker  did that  and you in  jail for it  oh shit  did you ever  let me see  you in here  again  so they just  took to me  i would walk  with them  every morning  they just  took to me  in case  somebody just  said fuck it  you're in there  on the skim  beef  but nobody  ever fucking  me because  it was such  bullshit  it was just  such  it was just  bullshit  dude 
[03:46:30]  it was like  it was like  the worst  thing  and the only  thing i think  of is  i could have  i could have  been in there  forever  on some shit  like that  in boston  i know  motherfuckers  that went  for a long  time  they put us  in there  for like  two months  because we  go yeah  we fucked  her  but it's  like that's  all  because obviously  it was so  obviously bullshit  that they couldn't  put you in there  any longer  they couldn't  just destroy  lives  which they did  destroy lives  because i bumped  into a couple  of other guys  one guy ran  and they never  caught him 
[03:47:00]  but he came  back because  it's the  statute of  limitations  but as another  kid it  changed his  life too  it just makes  you  one guy ran  until the  statute ran  out  yeah  ran until  they stopped  looking for him  and he said  fuck it  you know  i ain't  nah  fuck it  you know  and i didn't  run because i  thought well i  did run my  mother made me  run because she  just knew she  had an insight  that i didn't  have she's like  you know you  can't be  probably just  like what  yeah why  just some  pussy  but it's like  the person i'm  not even mad at  her because that's 
[03:47:30]  why it's like the  colby shit  happened and i  say immediately  black guys are  the most wanted  to be fucked  guys in the  world  but can't be  fucked  they're not  allowed  no women are  not allowed to  fuck black guys  on any level  meaning in an  open way  so it's like  when i heard that  colby shit i'm  like i know what  happened you know  what i'm saying  whatever happened  colby didn't take  no pussy but i  can't be mad at  her because this  is a white bitch  from colorado who  was not prepared 
[03:48:00]  to fuck a black  guy she's not  raised to fuck a  black guy you  understand so i  know what happened  it was just like he  didn't do the  proper thing you  know what i mean  he was probably  treated like shit  and she just  goes she's walking  around her pussy  hurts you know and  she goes i got  raped and it's just  that easy and i'm a  fucking giant nigga  in boston talking  if this girl had  been like uh uh the  the fucking mayor  like i said the  mayor's daughter she 
[03:48:30]  had been some white  girl who was out  there doing george  bush daughter shit  yeah and it came  out that she gave  all these niggas  some pussy you  wouldn't know me  oh damn you  wouldn't know me  you know holy shit  so that's why i go  you know when  motherfuckers say  rape now these  niggas that's out  here killing these  little girls 18 that  you know that's a  whole nother story  but when you get  some motherfucking  talking about you  know some old  fucking you know  and then i i said  no and no means 
[03:49:00]  no and blasey  blasey i fuck my  girl let me tell  you my girl's a  fucking maniac man  like she goes hit  me and this and  that and it took  me a long time to  be able to even  have enjoy sex man  on that level  because it's just  it's just i go  you think of the  consequences of  yeah you start  thinking a few  steps ahead of  yourself what if  i what if you  know i'm look at  one of these  bitches on your  wall you know  these these  agliara bitches  and i fuck them  and then i she  give me pussy and 
[03:49:30]  then say you  know you  rape me i  would i would  believe i did  because i'm like  you would i  wouldn't give me  pussy if i was  you but she  did you know  what i mean  so that whole  thing you know  it just it  changed my my  entire a lot  of my jokes the  pepsi cola rapist  right right  right the tyson  shit i do all  of that it  changed my life  because i just  had this mistrust  for for pussy  man it's not  an anger it's  just a mistrust  because you can  it's so easy  it's i guess 
[03:50:00]  that's the payoff  if you can be  raped then you  must have you  have to have a  natural mechanism  to stop that  from happening  which is it's a  i guess it's a  a trade-off  okay i i i'ma  say you rape me  that's the power  that a woman has  yeah i'm i'ma  just say you did  as opposed to  you doing it  yeah this guy  actually raped you  but i'ma say that  motherfucker you  know so that's  why when a bitch  10 years later  they say some  fucking janitor  took some pussy 
[03:50:30]  some black janitor  and then 15 years  later she goes  i was lying  yeah and then  and he gets out  and he gives the  speech of i found  i'm just happy to  be with my family  and i'm like man  if i did 15 years  it's like and  they find out that  the joggers the  central park jogger  kids didn't do it  i would make a  speech like look  um because after  three weeks  not now i was a  soft kid like  meaning i was  i was a clown  after three weeks  you you learn 
[03:51:00]  you you're in prison  yeah and i'm not  afraid no more  and you learn how  to motivate  you know how to  navigate  you learn how to  you don't take  stuff  the one bit of  advice that somebody  told me right when  i went in that was  that kept me  very very safe  is don't accept  any one thing  from anyone  if you need  something you go  without  yeah don't go  don't say hey  man you're hungry  if you're hungry  you eat your  fingers  don't because 
[03:51:30]  motherfuckers go  here's a snickers  bar and then they  want their snickers  bar and a milky  way tomorrow  yeah and it was  this guy in in  there and i was  gonna get in the  beef because i had  to and you just  learn the rules of  that shit and it  was this this dude  um who had a  woman's name  shirley you know  and what shirley  used to do is  give people new  people food and  then the next day  say i want my  food back and if  they didn't they  shirley would knock  you out and rape 
[03:52:00]  you  so one day i'm in  the fucking shower  oh no so shirley  says to me  oh that's what they  call me heavy d  in there  mmm heavy d  looking good  one of the fucking  southern state  motherfuckers goes  damn boy you can't  let that happen man  oh no  you can't let that  happen  was he a big dude  shirley  he was my size  oh damn  so he goes 
[03:52:30]  oh my god  you can't let that  happen man  he's telling you  you can't let that  happen  so that day i had  put on i never wore  the garb the prison  garb  but that day i put  the prison garb on  the blue shirt  top  up to my neck  fucking tucked it  in  and motherfucker  gave me the top  of a  soup can lid  bent up  oh shit  so i met  i met shirley

[03:53:30]  do anything  like i  holy shit  i've known you for years  this is such a journey  into a world  i have no clue  about  i'm just sitting back  and listening  like i've never  listened before  oh  man  i'm really  i see it in your eyes  bro  i see it in your eyes  you're ready to like  almost break down  it's great  i mean  that fucking  you know  and the reason i don't  because i'm in this  business man  it's a lot of fear  it's a lot of fear  but  yeah  my career  a lot of people have 
[03:54:00]  questions but bill in  new jersey  has a pretty good  question bill  yeah  patrice i was wondering  what happened with  the baby burner  yeah we all want to  know what happened  with the baby burner  i don't know  i don't remember  the baby burner  but i  why i  why i was concerned  about the baby  is because it was  relating to me  it was just like  i was like  is that  is my thing  is related to this  baby burner  that they wanted to  kill  right  now you  you realize  this is why  i'm very easy  going in life  a lot of stuff 
[03:54:30]  i learned  i learned from  that two months  of being there  it's like  there was going  to be a fight  one day  because this guy  was in there  for 25 years  the place i was  was called  an assessment  center  so they would  send guys  like me  there  and guys  who were  going to  death row  there  to assess you  for what you  did  and where you  would go  okay you're  going to stay  here and do  all your time  here  are you going  to go to  walpole  see the junction  walpole  which is 
[03:55:00]  the baddest  prison  on the east  coast  there's a half  of this country  walpole  has the highest  murder rate  going  i saw a documentary  on that  it's a dangerous  place  and wow  and they weren't  sending us there  we were going to do  the whole time  in this place  but it's like  the  like you said  the star wars  place  it's like  where people  go  to go  other places  before they  go somewhere  else  so this  motherfucker  one day  he  he stopped  everything  because everybody  was like  yeah man  you know 
[03:55:30]  i got six  months  yeah man  i'm out of  here in  three months  and then  and he  he turned  the table  over  and said  the next  i'm doing  25  motherfucking  years  the next  nigga  who say  he's doing  less than  that  i'm a  motherfucking  killer  oh  i'm scared  yeah  so  the baby  burner  it could have  been a year  planned  uh-huh  because the  motherfuckers  i was  talking to  the guys  that took 
[03:56:00]  kind of  who took  a liking  to me  they were  in there  for years  yeah  so if they  decide to  kill you  they kill  you  they kill  yeah  on their  time  just kill  them in  february  yeah we got  plenty of  time  you know  so i don't  know  what happened  what happened  to the guy  that uh  that made  the chick  suck his  dick  and that  she originally  said  yeah the  rape  and then  fuck  he  he got  off  like we  should  have  because he  had his 
[03:56:30]  trial in  stoughton  this bitch  was doing  transcontinental  rape cases  and shit  i'm in  boston  he's got a  black judge  who let  him go  with like  the shit  that should  have happened  like bitch  get out of  here  gave him  like probation  just because  it is  what it  is  and even  though she's  a hoe  that was  more coerced  sex than  what you  guys did  yes  coerced  hey man  i heard  what you  did  and after  she sucked 
[03:57:00]  his dick  she lost  it  which i  can't blame  i mean  that's a lot  of pressure  on a bitch  i can't  that's the  type of shit  you go  oh my god  i can't be  like sucking  black male  dick sucking  for the rest  of my fucking  life  black male  in two ways  you know  what i'm  saying  i can't  suck black  dick  and black  male  dick  and black  male  you know  what i mean  and  you know  you can't  blame  her  she wants  to do  it  on her  term  if she  wants to  get in  a car  with a  bunch  of guys  and suck  some dick  that's on  her terms  the reason 
[03:57:30]  lost it  and i can't  be mad at  her for that  the only thing  i'm bitter  about is that  it just  you know  it tarnished  my mind  you know  what i mean  it tarnished  my mind  you know  i just  not  i'm not  ever safe  in my head  like it's  kind of  i want to  cry right  now because  it really  is a  release  it's almost  like all right  you know what  please don't  cry  nah  i've never  hugged anyone  as big as  you  it's not  there anymore  like it's not  it's it's it's just  what it is the emotion
