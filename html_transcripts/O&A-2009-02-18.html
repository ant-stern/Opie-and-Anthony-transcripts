<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a sarcastic farewell to a departing K-Rock employee, Lisa.  The hosts then launched into a scathing critique of Alex Rodriguez's steroid confession, calling him names like "a-hole" and "douche," playing and dissecting clips from his press conference, and speculating on the broader implications of the steroid era in baseball.  This transitioned seamlessly into a discussion of the horrific chimpanzee attack in Connecticut.  The hosts repeatedly played the 911 call, emphasizing the caller's panic and the dispatcher's disbelief.  They detailed the victim's unusual relationship with the chimp, including shared wine and snuggling, and explored listener calls adding details like the chimp throwing dirty diapers.  The segment concluded with humorous, albeit graphic, speculation about a chimp's fighting prowess against various human fighters, including Mike Tyson, and even included a video of a sumo wrestler losing a tug-of-war to an orangutan. A listener made a racist comment about President Obama, which the hosts quickly dismissed.

The next segment started with a discussion of humorous online animal-versus-human videos, including a hot dog eating contest, an obstacle course race, and a jet-pulling contest. This led to a discussion of a controversial New York Post cartoon depicting a dead chimpanzee and referencing the stimulus bill, sparking debate about its racist implications towards President Obama. The hosts discussed the cartoonist's potential firing and then returned to the graphic details of the chimpanzee attack, playing more segments of the 911 call.  They discussed the dark humor juxtaposed with the horror of the event, fielding listener calls and debating the ethics of making light of such tragedies. A caller mentioned other cartoons by the same artist, including one depicting Obama surrounded by donkeys. The segment ended with a discussion of reality television, a “Funniest Listener Contest,” and a listener's Facebook message to the chimp attack victim;  a brief Black History Month tribute to a *Full Metal Jacket* character was also included.

The show continued with a discussion of a reality show about "mama's boys," focusing on one mother's prejudice against her son dating non-white women. This segued into a phone interview with the owner of the attacking chimpanzee, who defended her actions, claiming the chimp was well-cared for, even occasionally driving a car, and had been given Xanax shortly before the attack. A caller provided information about the paradoxical effects of tranquilizers on primates. The conversation then shifted to the K-Rock staff moving and the hosts' interactions with female employees.  The New York Post cartoon was revisited, along with street interviews about its racial implications.  Numerous tangents ensued, including Anthony's alcoholism, an upcoming Philadelphia show, and Northwest Airlines adding peanuts to its menu, prompting complaints from allergy sufferers. The segment concluded with a comedic audio piece about the chimp attack. Offensive language and crude jokes were frequent throughout.


The final major segment focused on a listener, David Freed, and his online flirtation with a married woman, "Marianne," on Facebook.  Opie, Anthony, Greg Gutfeld (a studio guest), and Stacy dissected David's messages, which contained affectionate terms and expressions of longing.  The conversation explored David's physical attraction to Marianne and his hopes for a physical encounter, potentially even in the studio.  The chimpanzee attack story returned, with a graphic 911 call played again. Reverend Al Sharpton called in to discuss the New York Post cartoon and its racial implications. The show frequently jumped between David and Marianne's online exchanges and the chimpanzee attack. The hosts and staff read excerpts from David's Facebook messages aloud, creating a comedic, and often awkward, exchange. David's parents' dating preferences (Jewish women, disapproval of non-white partners) were also revealed.

The show concluded with an extended, sexually explicit role-playing scenario where Opie and Anthony, along with the crew, pretended to call Marianne's husband, Rob. This involved sexually charged jokes and insults, with increasingly ridiculous attempts to "smooth things over."  Rob’s details about his wife and children fueled further inappropriate commentary. Following this, the conversation with Greg Gutfeld continued, covering Alex Rodriguez’s drug use (again referred to with the insult “douchebag face”), Madonna’s dating life, a 13-year-old father in England, the Octomom, and a transgender teenager, all discussed with sexually charged humor.  The final segment featured a comedic bit about a fictional character named Ted with a hilariously inept computer backup service, contrasted with a Carbonite advertisement. The broadcast was rife with crude language, sexual innuendo, and offensive jokes throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:00:30]  Is this the fond farewell to the entire staff here or something?  I think they're going somewhere else.  Yeah.  I think corporate's coming in.  Yeah.  Corporate.  Who's calling somebody?  Everybody.  All the salespeople and everything.  K-Rock, leave the building today.  Okay, yeah.  So all the salespeople that we all know.  You know when Lisa comes in and gives us our little shoulder massages?  It's going to be Tim now.  Tim Reed.  He's going to be coming in and giving us our shoulder massages now. 
[00:01:00]  He's got strong fingers, though.  Oh, boy.  Does he have manly hands?  He did pass the fact that it's a man.  It's going to be a good massage.  Oh, I have to give you a massage.  Oh, you're getting a massage.  He said he needs a massage.  A massage.  Almost sounds like Lisa.  We're doing it for Lisa.  We don't know anyone else here.  At this point, I think the only person I know is Lisa. 
[00:01:30]  And then, like, Tim and Stuntbrain we see every day.  Yeah.  That's it.  Who else do you know in this building?  Occasionally, you see Mara staggering around the hallways.  A drunk or something.  Trying to figure out, oh, my God.  What the hell happened to this business?  Oh, my God.  Her hair is skew.  Oh, my God.  She's got a wobbly, wobbly, like, thing.  Wobbly heel.  Yeah.  So we got steak and eggs today.  That's good. 
[00:02:00]  For Lisa, who we've worked with for over 10 years now.  Oh, yeah.  My God, Mara.  She's like a bad rash.  She'll never go away.  She keeps scratching.  And she's bummed that she's not going to see us anymore.  Because she'll be working downtown.  We'll be working up here.  Yeah.  She wasn't going to see us anymore when we left N.E.W.  Yeah, that's what I told her.  That's what I told her.  Silly business.  She's all sad, I guess.  I guess she's going to be teary-eyed today.  She told me, I'm going to be teary-eyed today.  I've got to say goodbye to you boys. 
[00:02:30]  I am going to be all teary-eyed.  Womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp.  Hug, hug, hug.  Why don't you fly into a jet engine?  That voice is hers.  We just figured it was a good excuse to get steak and eggs.  Oh, hell yeah.  Screw you, Lisa.  We're hungry.  Well, we would have this guy in every day.  Kenny told me when I was in the elevator, Basil Tease is here for breakfast.  He goes, and then he goes, and your bagel is on your table. 
[00:03:00]  I go, bagel?  Bagel.  Throw that thing away.  I'll wait for the eggs.  Yay.  Good old eggs.  Well, the big news is, A-Rod, what an a-hole.  What a douche.  I'm a Mets fan.  I don't see it that way.  I was talking to Yankee fans yesterday.  They hate this guy.  Everybody hates this guy.  The guy is one of these few guys that actually do step up, fess up to the whole thing.  He got caught.  No one's forgiven him.  It doesn't matter.  So did plenty of people. 
[00:03:30]  But the second you go up after you're caught and you say, oh, I'm sorry, this is a stupid thing I did, then you're forgiven.  It's the people that say, no, I didn't, and keep saying it.  That's the people that are scummy.  And if you look at it, this is over-the-counter.  This is stuff you bought at GNC or something.  You go to GNC, you buy that giant barrel or something.  Huh?  That's what I heard.  No, it wasn't the giant barrel.  It was over-the-counter in the Dominican Republic.  And, you know, you go to some of these countries like Mexico, you can buy anything over-the-counter. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  You know what you get over-the-counter in Canada and Mexico and the rest of these crazy places?  Oh, my God.  Harlan.  This guy's a phony.  He didn't mean anything you were saying yesterday.  He did it to try to save his own ass.  I didn't hear he was buying it in the Dominican Republic.  Yes!  And Travis has a great quote on this whole A-Rod thing.  Travis the monkey?  Susan Waldman.  Travis the chimp has a great quote.  Let me eat your face.  No, Travis is dead.  Nice nose, bitch. 
[00:04:30]  Yummy.  I can't wait.  By the way, stay tuned for the horrific 911 call.  Oh, my God.  It's amazing.  Wow.  Actually, that's the big story of the day.  We're just kidding.  I don't even think the 911 call is a story.  I think the warnings that all the news people were giving before they played it is the story.  Can we get that?  Folks, we want to warn you.  This is very graphic.  Please, if you're listening, remember a very disturbing clip.  This clip is horrifying.  That's what I heard every time I heard it.  Let's get a montage of that because... 
[00:05:00]  That means they couldn't wait to play the clip for you.  Of course.  Those phonies.  That's an attention getter when they say that.  What do you got, Travis?  Give Anthony that quote from Susan Waldman, of all people.  You want to do it in your Susan Waldman voice?  Well, I'm not the best at the Susan Waldman.  I think Jimmy does it pretty good.  Jim?  All right.  I'll try it.  Well, you know, it's this lady.  You know, everyone knows.  Goodness gracious, of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, a monkey eating a face. 
[00:05:30]  It's on your A-Rod sheet.  I get very frightened.  I'm sorry, Jim.  She had a quote?  Yeah.  Where's her quote?  What the hell does she have to say?  It's a good quote.  Because she studies the Yankees.  She studies baseball.  It's a good quote by this guy.  Posada knew.  Okay.  I hate her voice, but she's well-informed.  That's Susan Waldman.  Yes.  Do I believe in Alex Rodriguez?  That's Ted Waldman.  Oh, Uncle Paul Waldman. 
[00:06:00]  Do I believe?  She said, do I believe that Alex Rodriguez, who wouldn't have a Snickers bar or a cookie,  let his cousin inject him with something that he didn't know what it was?  I find that hard to believe.  Thank you.  I like the fact that she used the word believe twice in the quote.  The above.  Did you find it hard to believe that we were signing a lousy pitcher when the rocket came?  Exactly.  We find it hard to believe that you're wearing a Joyce DeWitt wig. 
[00:06:30]  You're a stupid Muppet face.  Did you see the press conference there?  He came across as a loser, man.  Clips.  Yeah.  As a phony.  Well, that's okay, because today Jeter will smooth everything over and make everyone look  Well, Jeter gave him a man hug.  Jeter is like, his name is even close to Jesus.  Yeah, I understand.  Jeter, Jesus.  He's beloved by all Yankee fans.  Yeah.  He will forgive A-Rod, anoint him, and everybody will be fine. 
[00:07:00]  All the steroid experts are scoffing at A-Rod's amateur claims.  Who's a steroid expert?  There's a lot of steroid experts out there.  No, he's gone.  Put some pudding out of his ear, and he's gone.  Well, he kept contradicting himself.  Like, one part he would say, you know, I didn't know what I was doing.  And then, you know, later on he would say, oh, it's so good to have this little weight  lifted off my shoulders.  Like, if one time he says I didn't do anything wrong.  With the weight of artificial muscles?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, you can't say you didn't do anything wrong and then say, oh, it's so good to get 
[00:07:30]  this off my chest.  I like when he said I was young and stupid or whatever he said.  He said that three times.  He was 24, 25.  That's not young, especially in baseball, when you've been playing baseball your entire life.  Yeah, he came in at a pretty high level.  Right, exactly.  That's E-Rock's excuse, even when he's not young anymore.  Here's a...  Ah, the head shakes.  I just see the hat shaking.  The hat go back and forth, left and right.  I can't see his face behind the monitor, but I just see his head shaking like, what  an ass.  He's disapproving. 
[00:08:00]  He was injected twice a month for 18 months.  You know what?  He probably is a phony.  But you know who else was a phony?  DiMaggio was a phony.  Mantle was a phony.  What?  Smell his finger.  He was not a phony.  He did do that.  Yes.  That was Mr. Coffee on his fingers, actually.  I am not saying that what they did affected their gameplay, but I mean, this perception we  have that baseball players are supposed to be this way.  I just don't...  Role model.  I don't care.  I just...  At all.  He's just a douche, though.  I agree.  A-Rod's just a douche.  He's a tool, but he should be able to do steroids.  They all should. 
[00:08:30]  He was in it during the, you know...  The steroid era.  Steroid era, they're calling it.  Well, Jesse Ventura has...  Like, he's bringing up a good point that...  What was it?  That the Bush administration orchestrated A-Rod's steroid use?  It's all a conspiracy.  That Vince McMahon was indicted when his wrestlers were taking steroids, and why isn't Bud  Selig being punished at all?  Oh, Jesse the body?  Yes.  That's not a bad...  That's not a bad little point.  It's not.  He said if 104 people have been tested positive for steroids, how come nobody's doing anything 
[00:09:00]  to Jesse the body?  Someone wasn't looking out, or somebody knew what was going on, knew it was good for the  game.  They all knew.  Oh, that guy.  They all knew.  Plus, Vince was probably sure.  Let's be honest.  Look at Bud Selig and look at Vince.  I mean, do you think that...  It's a little more believable that Bud Selig wasn't there when they were actually doing  it and showing them what cheek to put it in.  Bud never ran out and hit someone with a chair on the pitcher's mound.  That would have been great.  You know, Vince McMahon is pulling his pants down.  Oh, you do it this way. 
[00:09:30]  Throw the rosin bag in someone's eyes.  Here's some clips from A-Rod's press conference.  Going back to 2001, my cousin started telling me about a substance that you could purchase  over-the-counter in the streets as known as Boli or Bole.  It was his understanding it would give me a dramatic energy boost.  Boli knew.  My cousin and I, one more ignorant than the other, decided it was a good idea to start 
[00:10:00]  taking it.  My cousin would administer it to me, but neither of us knew how to use it properly, providing  just how ignorant we both were.  It was at this point we decided to take it twice a month for about six months during the  2001, 2002, and 2003 season.  He knew exactly how to do it.  He knew exactly what it was going to do to him.  They were great.  He was already with the Rangers.  Nine days ago, when he talked to Peter Gammons, he had no idea what he was thinking. 
[00:10:30]  He was taking it or who gave it to him.  Now, all of a sudden, it's Bolo, Bola, Bola, Ebola.  He's taking this crazy chance.  When he's already in the major leagues, he knew exactly what he was doing.  His cousin, King Kong.  I admire him because he came out.  He's still lying right through the entire press conference.  Did you know the stuff you were getting from the Dominican was steroids?  And if so, did you consider, I know you said you were young, did you consider the consequences 
[00:11:00]  at the time?  You know, I didn't think there were steroids.  You're a liar!  I mean, that's, again, part of being young and stupid.  Goddamn liar!  It was over-the-counter.  Get out of here!  It was pretty basic.  Get out of here!  And, you know, it was really amateur hour.  I mean, it was two guys.  We couldn't go outside.  We couldn't ask anyone.  We didn't want to ask anyone.  We went outside team doctors, team trainers.  It was two guys doing a very amateur and immature thing.  Nobody likes a tattletale except, of course, me. 
[00:11:30]  Me, come on.  He makes believe he was in high school or something, trying to get on the JV team.  Yeah, just in that.  He was already in the majors.  In that clip alone, he says, you know, we didn't think it was a big deal, but we went  around our team trainers and didn't want to ask anyone else about it.  No.  They were asking a lot of people about it.  The buzz was probably all over the place.  They're like, wow, you know, this thing.  You can take it.  You know?  Yeah.  He's a terrible liar.  Why would he take a major chance like that when he already had good numbers?  He had really good numbers. 
[00:12:00]  He had no idea what it was because, listen, as he was taking it, there's actually a clip  of him.  Yeah.  He doesn't know.  This is great ice tea.  See?  He didn't know.  And finally.  Do you consider what you did cheating?  That's not for me to determine.  I'm here to say that I'm sorry.  I'm here to say that.  Why is that not?  Yeah, exactly.  Why not?  Is it cheating or not in your eyes?  It's not for you to determine?  Hey, looking good, sports fan. 
[00:12:30]  Yes.  Do you consider it cheating or not?  Most people would consider it cheating because not everyone in the major leagues was doing  steroids.  If you know that this is banned already.  Right.  He should have said, no, I don't because, or I didn't at the time because there were so  many people doing it.  I assumed nobody in the league was doing it.  Right.  But that type of answer is kind of revolting.  But after this, you got to forgive him.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  See?  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, no. 
[00:13:00]  That's terrible.  That's just awful.  Yeah.  I got, I actually have audio of Aaron on steroids, believe it or not.  Oh, do you?  This is very rare.  Is this real life?  Why is this happening to me?  Oh, he's young and stupid.  Oh, he said he was young and stupid, right?  It's going to be forever?  Well, yeah.  Do you consider what you did cheating? 
[00:13:30]  That's not for me to determine.  I'm here to say that I'm sorry.  I'm here to say that in some ways I wish I went to college and got an opportunity to  grow up at my own pace.  You know, I guess when you're young and stupid, you're young and stupid.  And I'm very guilty for both those.  Very, very guilty.  Very guilty for being young and stupid.  25 years old, 24 years old, something like that.  Already in the major leagues for five or six years. 
[00:14:00]  18, so yeah, seven years he's been in the major leagues.  Yeah, that's young and stupid in the majors, huh?  Oh, yeah.  That's a good career for a lot of the guys.  Don't you love your country?  Yes, sir.  How about getting with the program?  Why don't you jump on the team and come on in for the big win?  For the big win.  He was under the pressure to come on in for the big win.  But like Ann said, it's all okay now because, you know, Derek Jeter stepped in, gave him  the chug.  Yep.  That man-hug thing, and now everything's okay.  I made an ass of myself.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm sorry I did that.  Huh?  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  Yeah.  Fisada left halfway through the press conference.  Really?  Yeah.  Why?  Because he knew.  He just got up and left.  Well, they're faces, and it was all calculated because the guys were in the front row or  something all dressed down.  Oh, yeah.  They had hoodies on and jeans.  Yeah.  Like, oh, this is one of those moments where we can't be flashy.  We've got to dress down.  The whole thing was calculated.  They're big jeans.  Oh, staged.  The whole thing was.  That was good TV.  Make their golden boy look good. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, they did the same thing with Pettit, but they like Pettit, you know?  Right.  I don't care if he's taking LSD.  Perform in October.  That's all we're asking you.  I'm kidding.  Whatever you've got to pump into your stupid frigging buttock cheek, at least hit the goddamn  ball in October.  Yeah, don't stop pumping it in your cheeks since the middle of September.  Yeah, yeah.  Keep going.  Right.  Have some.  Go right to the end.  I would always do it in April and May and June, and then just kind of stop.  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  Just let it fade out on its own.  Why do people dislike this guy?  What is it about A-Rod?  I mean, it is.  He's overpaid, and he underperforms the club.  It comes right down to that, right?  He can't get the hit in the key situations, Jimmy?  I think so, and I think that the fact that he's never really won a championship, and he  just comes off as a way overpaid dude.  And he got a lot of money at a very young age.  He's great, though.  I mean, you can't say he's not.  I mean, he's an MVP.  A-Rod's a great player, and I hate him.  I don't want him.  He's the best player in the game. 
[00:16:00]  I don't know about that.  I don't know.  Overall, absolutely.  Aside from the postseason.  He's going to set all the records, too.  Yep.  I would take Jeter on a high team over him any day.  Yeah.  To start a team, I would take Jeter over him in a second, because Jeter's a leader, and  Jeter won.  This jackass does nothing.  Jeter knows how to rally the troops.  Yeah, he is a good captain.  Yes.  Even though I can't stand him.  Trevor Munster was a better captain for the old incident.  A lot of people hate A-Rod just because...  Out of the plane.  Yeah, good captain.  Not that kind.  I'm like, oh, Captain Sully. 
[00:16:30]  No, they hate him because of his personality, too.  I mean, he's just...  Making a guy that he's got the biggest ego, you know, and he just carries himself terribly.  Oh, they say, look at me, really thinks who he is.  Sound like you and Sharon Stone should be talking about Ace.  Do we need the sponsor?  Great scene.  Yeah.  It's hot.  And there you go.  That's how we begin today. 
[00:17:00]  We'll go to the phones next.  877-212-018.  We're working on the Chimp 911 call.  But now we've got to get the warning montage.  The Chimp called, too?  The Chimp made a few phone calls.  There's a human hurting my teeth with its face.  These eyes are squishy.  Help.  They taste like juju beads.  Juju beads?  What are they called?  They're juju beads.  Are they really?  Yes, there's no beads.  I've been saying that long.  You mean these bleeds?  That makes sense, because I've been saying analbees.  Oh, yes.  Okay, see, there's a big difference. 
[00:17:30]  I'm sure it will affect the taste.  Also, a reporter that can't say peanuts keeps saying penis.  Really?  Yeah, he's just obsessed with that word.  And it's a guy?  I'm not really sure if this...  Girl?  What?  Yeah, it's a chick.  It is a chick?  All right, well, there you go.  We'll get into that as well.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Opie and Anthony, good morning to everybody.  Who's got a job today? 
[00:18:00]  877-212-ON-A.  Oh, this is the best part.  Here we go.  Get ready to kick him with the vocals.  Head chimp.  Oh, wow.  Seamless, though. 
[00:18:30]  All right, we got a chimp.  We got more details on the chimp.  We certainly do.  Before we get to the 911 calls, more details are coming out.  This woman up there in Connecticut with the chimp, she's a lunatic, first of all.  She's nuts.  You got to be a little crazy to have a 200-pound chimp run right now.  Well, people do that, but the stuff she was doing with this chimp is... 
[00:19:00]  Well, let me just read the first sentence.  Why Chimp Went Bananas on Gal is the headline.  Went bananas.  Get it?  Because they like bananas.  Each night, Sandra and her beloved chimp, Travis, would share a glass of wine before snuggling in bed together.  Oh, boy.  You can only imagine what was going on.  Yeah.  Why are you giving a chimp wine? 
[00:19:30]  And then snuggling in bed.  And then snuggling in bed.  Where was she taking the banana baby food?  Where was she putting that?  He had to be boozed up before he'd do it.  Yeah.  It's still a beast.  Yes.  You know, have arms and legs and kind of make faces like a person, but...  She probably turned the thing into an alcoholic.  Yeah.  The Connecticut widow says she still cannot fathom how that loving animal who she raised as her child could turn violent. 
[00:20:00]  But when he began to maul her friend, Sharla, or, right, Sharla Nash?  Sharla Nash!  Sandra said she didn't hesitate to stop him, even if it meant killing him.  Well, she said that he...  Her friend not only came with a different hairstyle, which was not long brown, it was short, blonde, puffy, it was a different car.  He just didn't recognize her.  And I guess he was freaking out because he had Lyme disease, and she'd given him a Xanax to calm him down.  Xanax wine? 
[00:20:30]  What are you doing to this thing?  Can you give chimps Xanax?  I mean...  You can, but it didn't work out.  How do we know that they can handle Xanax?  Who made that call?  Yeah, how do you know it works?  What do you ask them?  Are you nervous anymore?  Right.  That's a crazy judgment call.  What, you got veterinarians out there, like, experimenting with this stuff?  Yeah, it's okay to give him a half of Xanax if he's feeling a little edgy.  I had to get a shovel and a knife to get Travis off of Charlie. 
[00:21:00]  The visibly shaken woman said yesterday, it was very difficult to do this, but I had  to say to my friend, I'm so sorry for what happened to Charlie.  She's my dear friend.  The violence began.  Surely, all right, we know all that.  I'm not going to be kissing her hello anymore.  That's not sure.  Just kiss a packet of open chop meat.  Well, then it goes into the 911 call, so I don't have to read anymore here.  Dude, how awful is it to be having your face eaten by a chimp and to gouge your eyes, and  then the owner's trying to get it off you, and then she has to go, let me go get another  weapon. 
[00:21:30]  This isn't working.  Yeah.  The whole time, he's still biting and hitting you.  Yeah.  I'm stabbing it, and it's just making it worse.  I think it could possibly be the worst thing that could happen to you.  Yeah, that is horrible.  And still live.  Wild beast.  And still live.  You know, at least...  It's just pulling your eyeballs out and eating them in front of your face.  At least a lion or tiger, stuff like that.  They know.  They grab your throat and just squish it, and you're dead.  It's over fast.  Yeah. 
[00:22:00]  There have been maulings and stuff, but I think that's more the lion or tiger just effing  with you.  Yeah.  But if they want to kill you and eat you, or you're interfering with their young or something  like that, whammo.  Right for the neck.  The chimp eats you like you're a good rib.  Chimp's just like nibbling on your face and ripping your arms out.  Just trying to find all the soft meat off your body.  What kind of strength it has to just rip your arm out of its socket?  I don't even want to...  That thing was just going crazy.  Did it rip her arm out? 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Ripped her arm right out.  Let's say hi to James in New Hampshire.  What's wrong?  James?  I've got chicken wing.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Just pops it out of its socket.  I just wanted to...  Yeah, James.  Yesterday, it was Inside Edition.  They revisited, I believe his name was St. Pierre.  That was attacked by his chimp, Moe, last year.  Yes.  Oh, the famous story.  Yes.  And they revealed his brand new face, which included a wax nose, but they implanted three 
[00:23:00]  magnets in his skull and three in the nose.  So it's a detachable wax nose.  Yeah, we were talking about that yesterday.  It pops on and off.  Yeah.  Oh, and it's fantastic.  They actually mic'd it, and you hear the click as the magnets connect.  It was hilarious.  I guess that's a pretty cool thing.  Amazing how medicine is.  I guess there's no way to build a realistic-looking nose out of you.  He sneezes on the subway, and it goes flying across the car.  Oh, it just goes...  It just goes, hey, there's a door jam on the phone. 
[00:23:30]  No, no, don't kick that.  That's half my face.  There are just two slits where his nose used to be.  We're looking at the picture now.  Did we put this up on ONA Radio?  That goddamn monkey just bit his nose right off.  Oh, yeah.  Just bit his nose off and ate it.  How's the guy doing?  You said they gave an update.  Besides the wacky nose, what else is going on with him?  Besides the fact that he looks like the villain from Silence of the Lambs, the second version, 
[00:24:00]  I guess he's doing all right.  Yeah.  I guess it's easy to blow your nose.  You just pull it off and tip it out now.  Like an ashtray from the Vega.  Punch it out, boys.  All right.  Thanks for that, man.  All right.  Here's the montage of the news warning you about the 911 call.  Oh, yes.  Just moments after her beloved pet went on a rampage in Connecticut.  Now we have to warn you, the call is disturbing and it's graphic.  Police in Connecticut have released the chilling 911 call from that horrific chimpanzee attack. 
[00:24:30]  And we want to warn you, the 911 call is disturbing.  A bone-chilling 911 call from a Connecticut ranch.  The anguish of the call for help is chilling.  They can't wait to play it.  When you hear that, you turn the radio up.  That's what I did.  Yeah.  I heard like, and it's very disturbing.  Yeah.  Whoop, volume.  It's like we were talking yesterday.  It's that whole rubbernecking thing.  Yeah.  You know, there's no redeeming value to playing the 911 call on the news. 
[00:25:00]  We're not going to learn anything.  No, we know everything that happened.  We just want to hear the desperation.  Yeah.  I want to be able to hear the little chimp in the background just asking for some grape  coupon and some salt and pepper.  Our whole job is to go, could you imagine if this was me?  I can't imagine being eaten alive by a chimp.  That's exactly what it is, too.  And that's all it is.  They want to play on people's sympathies and fears. 
[00:25:30]  Because we're not going to have a chimp-eating humans epidemic anytime soon.  This is one of those extremely...  Could it happen in your town?  Of course not.  Yes.  Where do you live?  What's your emergency?  This is changing.  What's the problem?  Send the police.  Send the police.  Oh, my God.  That thing does not sound happy.  That sound.  Just hearing that and it's ripping you to pieces. 
[00:26:00]  It's in distress.  It's so angry.  Oh, my God.  I haven't heard these yet.  Me neither.  I'm enjoying my omelet.  Can you throw a nose out here?  Why don't you put a couple of grapes in the middle of the other one?  The eyeballs.  That's your emergency.  This is changing.  What's the problem?  Send the police.  Send the police.  What's the problem there?  The chimp killed my friend.  What's the problem with your friend? 
[00:26:30]  Please.  What's the problem with your friend?  I need to know.  Send the police off with a gun.  With a gun.  Hurry up.  You're off the gun.  Please, hurry up.  He's killing my girlfriend.  What is the problem?  He's killing my friend.  Who's killing your friend?  My chimpanzee.  Oh, your chimpanzee is killing your friend.  Oh, my God.  Oh, your chimpanzee.  Why don't you go back to the bar and call me later on when your chimpanzee goes away? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, this is not.  This guy is like, she's just like, chimpanzee, friend, gun, police.  But it's like, you can hear that primal attack.  That sounds like a bird, actually.  That's frightening, man.  Yeah.  Blah, blah.  Isn't that nasty?  He's just saying in chimp, I'm going to eat your face.  There's nothing you can do.  And there was nothing you could do about it.  Her face is gone.  Her face is gone.  You've got to assume they already sent the cops out, and he's just on the line with her.  You've got to assume that.  That's usually what they do, you know? 
[00:27:30]  You just kind of send the cops out.  How?  They don't have the address yet.  They've got to give them an address.  The picture of this chimp, they keep showing it on TV.  Why would you be friends with someone that has a pet chimp that wears a diaper?  I would never go over their house.  I would never assume.  Rather than not wearing a diaper.  No, I'm just saying I don't want to be around someone that has a chimp as a pet.  You can't assume that they know what they're doing.  Yes, it could be that we were hearing in the background. 
[00:28:00]  Yes, it could be that.  Yes, it could be that.  I'm just reading horrific, horrific pal talk responses to what we were hearing.  But there's footage of him being so cute with a baby,  and there's footage of him in the commercials with Morgan Fairchild.  Well, he was a little baby.  He's an old, grumpy chimp now.  I mean, they have older footage of him, too,  when the police had to wrangle him in.  But he was still kind of cute.  The problem is when the chimp is young and playful, 
[00:28:30]  you put him in commercials, the chimp doesn't know any better.  But then the chimp gets older, it gets the hormones going,  and now you're preventing it from getting some of that nice chimp you-know-what.  Was it a male or female?  It has been.  What was it?  Travis.  Oh, man.  We don't know.  It could be either.  So if you've got a chimp as a pet, you've got to get him some hoo-ha.  Yeah.  Because eventually, you know, eventually that's going to catch up with him.  I think it's like the child star syndrome, you know?  He got all the attention. 
[00:29:00]  Right.  He was a little baby cute chimp working with Morgan Fairchild.  Right.  And look at what happens.  He gets older.  He gets all ugly looking, mangy.  No one wants him anymore.  He was the bell of the ball at one point.  Yes.  Yeah.  Chimps.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Just screaming at you while your limbs are being ripped off.  Oh, he's really, really attacking that lady.  Oh, boy.  He was mad.  Let's go to Rich.  And there's no talking to it, which is like, hey, settle down.  Let's talk this out.  Yeah. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, sorry.  You're a chimp.  Well, she should have had a stun gun or something.  She should have had some kind of weapon.  Yes.  It just happened.  But the friend couldn't stop.  That's the scary part is this woman who raised him.  Right.  Couldn't get him off.  Because of all the wine and Xanax.  And who knows what else she's pumping into the chimp.  She stabbed him and it made him mad.  Right.  It's like LaMotta beating his brother.  Let's go to Rich in O-Town.  Rich.  Hey, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Hey, I just want to say, at the beginning of it, it sounds like it's a wacky radio prank call, 
[00:30:00]  like PLJ or the Jerky Boys or something.  And the dispatcher doesn't even sound like he believes it.  It sounds like, oh, yeah, yeah, chimp.  Right.  Okay.  Right.  Wait, let me hear that again.  Sure, emergency.  This is Katie.  What's the problem?  Send the police.  Send the police.  What's the problem there?  The chimp killed my friend.  What's the problem with your friend?  Oh, please.  What's the problem with your friend?  I need to know.  Send the police off with a gun, with a gun. 
[00:30:30]  Hurry up.  You're off the gun.  Please, hurry up.  No, send the police.  He's killing my girlfriend.  What is the problem?  He's killing my friend.  Who's killing your friend?  Bob.  Bob Abui.  Oh, you just want to see he's killing your friend.  Let's say hi to Keith in Connecticut.  We got more of the 911 call, but first, Keith.  Keith, go ahead.  Hey, what's up?  You were talking about that diaper before.  Yeah.  They own a towing business.  So on top of you getting your car towed away and being aggravated, when you go to the 
[00:31:00]  office to go pick up your car, that filthy monkey would throw his diaper out the window  at you and hit you.  For real?  This thing was throwing dirty diapers around?  Yeah, nonstop.  Nonstop.  If you look at the news, the building they keep showing with the tow trucks, the second  floor, the window has bars on it and it sticks outside the building.  So he has a clear shot.  He just drops them like water balloons.  Wow.  All right.  Punch it out.  Thank you.  Would you do a chimp diaper mustache? 
[00:31:30]  If it prevented him from doing that to my face, I certainly would.  That's pretty funny.  Hey, 911, this is a Mario.  There's a monkey throwing the barrels at me.  He's a giant killer, my princess friend.  People on PalTalk are funny.  Is there more of that?  That's not the whole call, right?  No, let's go with this one.  There's someone on the way.  Who's gone?  Please shoot him.  What is the monkey doing? 
[00:32:00]  Tell me what the monkey's doing.  He ripped her face off.  He ripped her face off?  He tried to attack me.  Please, please.  Okay.  I need you to calm down a little bit.  They're on the way.  Can you put yourself away?  I don't want the monkey attacking you.  Please, hurry up.  Listen to me.  All right.  They're on the way, ma'am.  They're on the way, ma'am.  They've got to shoot him.  Please.  Please, hurry, hurry.  You're there with your friend.  I need you to help your friend.  Can you go help your friend?  I can't.  What are you, nuts?  This guy doesn't know how to handle it.  Can you go help your friend?  It's obvious. 
[00:32:30]  No, she can't.  Help your friend.  Are you crazy?  She's, that lady has left out this whole time.  Yeah.  That woman has chimp teeth being sunk into her.  Yes.  And he's ripping her apart.  Yeah.  He's already ripped her face off by the time this call is made.  Face is gone.  You know, I think the operation would be saying, can you go help your friend?  Can you help your friend?  Maybe, you know, pat the chimp on the head.  Hey, hurry.  Are you there with your friend?  I need you to help your friend.  Can you go help your friend?  I can.  He tried to attack me now. 
[00:33:00]  Is he still there with your friend?  Yes.  Okay, so then back off.  Then don't get any closer, okay?  They're already on the way.  Yeah.  Can you jump over the monkey and the barrels and help your friend?  Let's hear that 911 audio again.  There's someone on the way.  With the music.  What is the monkey doing?  If you're interested, there's a Donkey Kong kill screen coming up. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, I'm with Larry.  Larry.  Larry.  You're going to fight your chimp dead in the driveway, Larry.  Your mother, Larry.  Your mother's a chimp, Larry.  You know, I was going to say the same thing about the stun gun.  If you own a monkey, why wouldn't you own a stun gun?  Yeah, I totally agree with you.  Yeah, it doesn't mean you have to use it on the thing, but just in case.  Exactly, exactly. 
[00:34:00]  If you're not freaking out, shock them.  Shock the monkey, you're saying?  And then you can play that song.  Or spank the monkey.  Or spank the monkey.  You know what it is, too?  We had little Mikey in here.  Adorable.  And his back is solid.  It feels like a bone.  The muscle is so solid.  A stun gun in that case, he's just going to rip your arm off with a stun gun.  You're not going to stun gun this thing.  Dude, Mikey, there was something in his eyes.  It's going to happen to Mikey eventually.  No, Mikey was adorable. 
[00:34:30]  We should get Mikey back in.  Hell no.  I would hold Mikey.  I would trust Mikey.  Ask Mikey.  Yeah, this woman trusted her chimp.  What happened?  Make sure to give Mikey a urine check first.  Make sure he's not on drugs.  I don't want a drugged out monkey.  No, it was Xanax in his tea or something.  He's drinking tea and wine.  Exactly.  Just my luck.  You trust Mikey, and the next thing you know, Mikey's eating my eyeballs in front of you.  No, Mikey will not be returning to the show.  Why?  Screw all chimps and monkeys at this point.  Mikey was a good boy.  What?  He just got to scratch his head a little. 
[00:35:00]  That's what they like.  Sugar, sugar, sugar.  They cut it out.  She did say that the chimp ate her friend's face off, right?  Ripped her face off.  Ripped her face off.  You want to take his face?  Yes.  His face off.  The eyes, nose, skin.  It's coming off.  The face off. 
[00:35:30]  Off.  Off.  That was the whole call?  We got two more after the break, Jimmy.  There's more of the call?  Oh, yeah.  Well, this goes on and on with the chimp just chewing away at her friend.  What, is she a chatty Cathy this lady?  Yes.  I didn't start doing radio yesterday.  We're going to tease the hell out of this one.  Going to get some TSL and some QM and some quarter hours, right, Stunt Brain?  Yes, sir.  That's what we do today.  Ah, let's say hi to Dan in East Meadow.  Dan. 
[00:36:00]  Dan.  Hey, boys.  How are you doing this morning?  Good.  It sounds like Sheila Braswoski from South Park.  Don't help your friend.  What, what, what?  Yeah.  It does sound like that.  My chimpanzee.  Send Officer Barbrae.  Take it easy, boys.  That's a good one, bro.  Let's go to Talon, the trucker.  Talon, what are you hauling?  Chimpanzees.  Papers, paper towels, stuff like that.  You hear about the truck that dumped its meat all over the highway there?  No, I didn't hear about that. 
[00:36:30]  Big story here in New York.  I don't know where they got the footage, but meat all over the highway.  Apparently it was a bunch of Ambegals.  Ambegals.  That's funny.  Why wasn't there a chimp on that set?  There was.  He wrote the script.  What talent?  I said, I guess that's why they call that area in the meatpacking district over there  in New York.  What a bop a bop a bop.  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Don't jackknife.  That would break my effing heart.  Hey, Talon, is there a reason for your phone call today?  How much more interesting would it be if the chimp was sexually aroused and just wanted a good  time with the lady?  How would the lady do that kind of a call?  Oh, my God.  Get a condom.  Get the police with the condom.  I want to know what else this woman was doing with her pet chimp if they're sharing wine 
[00:37:30]  and snuggling in bed together.  What else is going on?  I would assume that there was some hanky-panky going on, which angered the chimp because he  wanted no part of it.  No part of it.  Let's say hi to Dylan.  Hi, Dylan.  Long Island.  Dylan.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, Dylan?  Got you on your desk with your pencils.  Tell me that's not George Costanza's mom.  Yeah, that's another one that kind of sounds like George's mom. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Right?  Yes, very good.  Almost like a bitch.  Oh, here's another really good one.  Mike in Chicago.  Mike.  Hey.  Hey.  She's eating my girlfriend's face.  Of all the dramatic things.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  King Kong's face.  He knew.  Mighty Joe Young is there.  Goodness gracious.  Goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen. 
[00:38:30]  And the grin.  Grape ain't.  Grape ain't new.  Hey, I hope to see you next season and eat your face.  Oh, there's Magilla in George's box.  I can't believe it.  Gorilla.  Jesus.  There's Magilla in Curious George's box.  My mouth sounds really what?  Lancelot Link knew. 
[00:39:00]  Secret chimp.  He used to make him talk.  He was a secret agent chimp.  And his big defense, I think, was eating people's face.  They should have had that.  Oh, the excitement.  Coco signing.  That would have been a better picture to put an ape up there.  Sure would have given a more inspirational speech at a George's box.  See you again.  Will you?  Will you?  My country girlfriend will try to hang herself. 
[00:39:30]  All right.  Thanks for talking to you.  Good for you.  All right.  After the break, at least two more 911 calls as the chimp continues attacking.  Fantastic.  This story just won't go away anytime soon.  He was biting his leg the whole time?  The whole time just the damn thing was hungry and angry and probably horny and anxiety-ridden.  Oh, drunk.  Hungover.  But this chimp would have attacked.  That's the beautiful thing.  There's no bullying.  Like if George Foreman or Tyson or anybody had gotten out of that car, this would have happened the same way. 
[00:40:00]  I mean, it wasn't like he picked on a weaker target.  Yeah.  He would have attacked anybody the same way.  I didn't see that.  Tyson in his prime against an, like, angry chimpanzee.  Tyson would be on the ground getting his face eaten.  He would...  He would...  Yes!  Yeah.  This thing would rip his arm out.  Are you kidding me?  Tyson would have a...  Tyson would have a great punch.  Yeah?  Yeah?  He would have a shot at his prime.  He would have a shot at his prime.  He would have a shot at his prime.  Oh, one punch, that chimp would be down. 
[00:40:30]  Nope.  The chimp is down.  Stop the fight.  Stop the fight.  Down goes Frazier.  Down goes Frazier.  Down goes Frazier.  Right.  Say it again, Sonny.  Is there a better sports call ever than that, though?  Do you believe in miracles?  His wig was flipping each time he said it.  Do you believe in miracles?  Greatest sports call of all time.  Is that the Bobby Thompson home run?  No.  The Americans win the gold.  Olympics.  That was...  That wasn't that one in the gold, though.  Oh, that's right.  You're right.  You're right.  Yeah, they beat the Rooshkis. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, but you're right.  That was still amazing.  But beating the Russians was the thing to do, though.  It was more important to just beat the Russians back then.  At that point, it almost didn't matter if they didn't turn around and win the gold.  But what was it?  Tyson and a chimp.  Let's see.  Tyson and a chimp.  That's why he...  See, no element of surprise there.  They're both in the corners of the ring.  The chimp comes out.  Tyson comes out.  And they start fighting.  That's why humans are lame. 
[00:41:30]  We think we're so great.  Tyson is so great.  You put him in with a chimp that doesn't even have any boxing experience and it's over like that.  Remember Tyson in his prime?  There's no way.  Tyson...  Bit of Andrew Holyfield, though.  I mean, Tyson understands that barbara fighting style.  Tyson will bite your face.  Yeah, but the ear pretty much stayed intact for the most part.  If the chimp is biting your ear, the whole thing's coming off.  Yeah.  The whole thing will pop off your face.  That's the difference.  This thing would bite your testicles off.  Like, that's what he'd do in the wild.  The ref's got to step in for the low blows.  That's not fair. 
[00:42:00]  I'm not saying the chimp wouldn't have points deducted.  Yeah.  The chimp is not winning on points.  But he would eventually win by removing your limbs.  Do you guys ever see the old footage of the Olympic sprinter?  Was it Jesse Owens taking on a horse?  That was Jesse Owens, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Just showing how lame humans really are in the end.  I know.  You put a dolphin in the pool, Michael Phillips doesn't have a chance.  But we all think Michael Phillips is the greatest thing ever.  Take a dolphin to a friggin' grocery store, see how long he lasts.  Give a dolphin a bong and watch how stupid he just stares at. 
[00:42:30]  Sticking it in his blowhole.  Just trying to take a hit.  Yeah.  Losing his tuna endorsements.  But we just brag about it.  Humans just brag about how great we are, though, physically.  And then, you know, the animals just laugh at us if they had brains.  Thank God we have brains and opposable thumbs to just destroy them with.  And go, look, sorry, dolphins, you can't be in the Olympics.  We make the rules.  I'm sorry.  Invent a gun, stupid. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  Then we'll start paying attention.  Right.  They do beat us physically.  But you know what?  I don't see a lot of monkeys with us running around in diapers in their houses.  There you go.  Run around.  Entertain us.  Juggle.  Taylor.  Taylor.  Yeah.  We think after all these years, one of these animals would, like, you know, try to get  a job or something.  Why is it us and then nothing?  We've done this break before.  Yeah.  It just bothers me that it's us and then nothing.  You're not waiting for the bus with another animal.  You know, nothing. 
[00:43:30]  The animals started working.  They haven't even attempted to start working at a real job.  Maybe the economy would be better.  They could have their own type of money.  Right.  If we could tax the hell out of, like, squirrels and stuff, you know, the economy would be in  way better shape.  The treasury of frigging acorns.  That'll be wonderful.  That doesn't freak out anyone else.  It's us and then nothing.  Not another animal coming up.  Coming up in the ranks.  Nah.  That creeps me out.  Happy about it.  Apes.  They're not living in apartments and getting jobs.  They bite your face off.  They're right behind us.  They're not that far behind us. 
[00:44:00]  I mean, compared to...  They get TV gigs.  They're way behind us.  They're not walking around with iPhones.  We'd like to think they're close, but they're nowhere near us still.  Eyeballs in their mouth.  Right.  We got iPhones.  They got eyeballs in their mouth.  Exactly.  And this doesn't freak anyone out.  I want Mikey in.  I want to pet Mikey in.  Yeah.  I feel better about chimps again.  Well, Mikey's good.  He's great.  Yeah.  Doesn't make sense.  Shoot, little chimp.  We don't belong here.  Aliens put us here.  Thank you.  Steve on Long Island.  Hey, I got a question for you guys. 
[00:44:30]  What the hell was Edith Bunker doing with that chimp?  I want you.  I want you.  I want you.  I want you.  Oh, I want you.  Everyone's coming out for...  Yeah, she sounds like a lot of different people.  She's a little panicky Penelope.  Oh.  Can we throw this...  Oh.  Oh.  You know, I can't take the credit.  Let me give...  Oh, that's a good one.  Let me say hi to Gill in Boston.  I want someone on this immediately, and I want to be able to play this tomorrow.  Immediately.  Oh, I want to hear her with Christian Bale. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Oh, Jimmy.  That's great.  What?  This guy just blew up his spine.  He just blew up the spine of a working stiff that could get a little attention today.  I've got to put him.  I apologize.  I figured I said that.  So what?  Gill in Boston.  How are you?  These names are just wrong.  What's up?  Hey, Gill.  Gill.  Hey, man.  I want to hear Christian Bale.  I said that.  I said it first.  I actually...  I didn't read what you said, but Ope's reaction, I knew there was some...  He said by tomorrow, there's some kind of audio. 
[00:45:30]  I'm like, what else could it be?  Yeah.  So I did steal it by proxy.  No, Gill.  That's a good idea.  That's a very good idea.  Let's get on that.  Let's mix the Christian Bale and the 911 call audio.  Oh, good for you.  Hey, can we put the audio up on onaradio.com so people can download that and make some mixes  for us?  Okay, we'll do that immediately.  Immediately.  And of course, the obvious.  Thank you, Blackout Earl from Wagbag.  Oh, they did take that name.  Nice.  It has to be Ultimate Fighting Rules.  Of course.  Ultimate Fighting.  You put a chimp in.  You put a chimp in with any of the UFC guys. 
[00:46:00]  It's not even close.  All right.  What about Fedor?  It's not even close.  Fedor would have been on the ground having his Russian face eaten the same way that old  lady was.  Monkey wouldn't tap out.  I'd say chimps never tap out.  Chimp would never lose.  What if you get him one of those arm locks and you're bending and the chimp ain't tapping  so you could snap that chimp arm, you think?  You think you could snap a chimp arm?  The chimp grabs your leg and bites your foot off.  What do you think the chimp does?  Play by UFC rules? 
[00:46:30]  When Fedor is being pinned, there's a guy's leg by him.  The chimp bites your testicles.  Let me up.  Fedor gives you just a nice cute little twisty and hope you tap out.  The chimp rips it off and goes, are you going to tap out or am I going to now eat your  testicles in front of you?  Yeah, true.  It's not even close.  That's why we're lame.  Humans are lame at sports.  I wish PETA wouldn't get involved and you could actually have people face off.  And I mean, seriously, punching that chimp as hard as you can in the face.  There should be some kind of... 
[00:47:00]  Just try to box him.  Keep him off of you.  Keep him away from you, Rock.  Yeah.  You got to keep him off of you and then jab and just stop.  Keep punching him in the face.  There should be some...  No one does long arms get you.  There should be some kind of rule.  If a chimp eats your friend's face off, then PETA can't get involved and now we put the  chimp in the UFC.  It's go time.  Tell the tape.  It's go time.  Right.  But we don't know how to...  PETA got involved in this case, by the way.  We'll explain after the break.  Mike's panicking with that.  Mike's ready to bite someone's face off if we don't go to break.  We don't know how...  Oh my God.  He's chimpin' out on us. 
[00:47:30]  We don't know how to fight animals.  Like when a chimp comes flailing those long arms, nobody stands there in fighting pose.  You go, monkey attack!  Right.  And you curl up and get bit.  Right.  You try to box him with those long arms.  It ain't happening.  He has no finesse at all.  He just skips with primordial rage and flails his chimp arms and you go, I'm dead.  Teeth get to your face.  Yeah.  Then it's over.  Big hairy chimp arms.  You know, they say if you're hiking and you come across a mountain lion or a bear or something, 
[00:48:00]  the best thing to do is try to make yourself look as big and large as possible.  Who the F is going to stand there in a path and do that?  Curling up in the fetal position.  You are turning and running, which is the worst thing you can do, but who's going to be brave enough to go,  all right, I read this somewhere.  I'm going to just make myself really big looking.  I'll outrun this cougar.  Jumps on your back and just gnaws at your neck.  All of a sudden, you're that little friggin' laser light you put on the carpet for your cat.  Right.  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  That's a great way to look at it.  Please. 
[00:48:30]  All right.  Let's satisfy our own chimp, Mike, over there.  Opie and Anthony in the middle of the 911 audio of that chimp attack up there in Connecticut.  Let's say hi to Bruce in New Jersey.  What's going on, Bruce?  Hey, what's up, bro?  Hey, Bruce.  Tim and Ant, what's up?  Hey, listen, you guys ever see this show on cable called Man vs. Beast? 
[00:49:00]  I heard about it.  Well, they had this guy this weekend.  They had this 400-pound sumo wrestler doing a tug-of-war with an orangutan that weighed 130 pounds.  This sumo wrestler, this fat thing, was pulling and pulling.  He couldn't move this orangutan.  Your orangutan's, like, scratching his nuts and holding onto the rope in one hand.  One hand.  Man, I'm actually watching the video as you talk about it, and it really is funny, man. 
[00:49:30]  Wow.  When he gets tired, this sumo wrestler, he just starts pulling and pulls this guy like nothing.  He didn't even punch that friggin' orangutan, man.  He couldn't even punch him.  Look, the orangutan is barely struggling.  Yeah, the orangutan's got, like, a wooden thing where he can kind of put his feet, where he can hold on.  Right.  Well, they both do.  They both do, yeah.  He can't even punch that orangutan.  Dude, chimp strength is so much stronger. 
[00:50:00]  Like, yeah, any of these apes.  They hang by their feet.  The great apes.  Any of them.  I knew this chimpanzee thing was going to happen as soon as Obama became president.  Oh.  Oh.  You know why?  Why?  I know racism is so easy to do.  Why do you have to be so goddamn, like...  Bruce, you had a good call going, too, my friend. 
[00:50:30]  I figured I'd throw that one out there.  All right, Bruce.  I figured he'd throw that one out.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Sumo wrestler versus monkey.  We'll link the video on ondayradio.com, but it's man versus beast.  Proving that, yeah, we're lame.  Humans are lame.  We like to think we're great at athletic competition, but...  You know what is great, though?  We can take things, and then using our wonderful brains and hands, we build it, and then we can  take a chimp and run him over with a car. 
[00:51:00]  I like to see chimp versus car that we built.  That's right.  Some of the other things they did on...  When you're talking mono-e-chimpo, that is where they could kick our ass.  You should have posted...  Oh, sorry.  Yeah, some of the other things they did on Man vs. Beast before we move on.  That professional leader that wins the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest pretty much every year.  Yeah.  Until recently, I can never say his name.  The Japanese fella.  Kobayashi.  Kobayashi, sure.  He lost a hot dog eating contest against a Kodiak bear. 
[00:51:30]  They also had a Navy SEAL.  He won a race against a chimpanzee through an obstacle course.  Well, the chimpanzee gets all confused.  Of course that's going to happen.  They're like retards.  They're very strong, but they are kind of retarded when it comes to, you know, figuring stuff out.  Imagine if they were as smart as we were.  Right.  Maybe they'd be like Planet of the Apes.  Oh, they got that, too.  All these videos are up online.  The little fella's doing good on the obstacle course. 
[00:52:00]  How the hell does it learn to do this?  They sure can climb.  Yeah.  Jiminy Cricket.  A group of 44 dwarves lost a race against an Asian elephant to see which could pull a commercial jet a certain distance first.  44 dwarves?  That's hilarious.  Against an Asian elephant.  Should have all been sucked into the engine.  Great.  I hit some dwarves.  I'm landing in the Hudson.  Sean Crawford, a world-class sprinter, won a 100-meter race against a giraffe. 
[00:52:30]  Outsprinted a giraffe, but lost against a zebra.  Yeah, zebra.  What happened with the giraffe?  The big, long neck got in the way of...  They're kind of lumbering giraffes.  They do this loping kind of gallopy thing, but it's very slow.  And then the sumo wrestler thing we just talked about to start that.  What were you saying, Jimmy, in the postcard?  New York Postcard, too.  I'm sure it doesn't mean anything nasty, but it says it's got the two cops and the dead chimp, 
[00:53:00]  and the thing is they'll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill.  Well, that's the quote.  What?  No, it isn't.  Yes, it is.  That's the New York Post cartoon.  Are you kidding me?  What, did they just completely lose their minds?  I'm sure they'll say no, it's simply because...  What did they mean by that?  Probably because, I mean, it obviously sounds like it's a nasty...  We all know what it sounds like.  In this day and age?  But it's obviously...  I'm sure they don't mean that. 
[00:53:30]  What's the other angle on this?  I'm glad you pointed that out because, you know something, we're going to see some unbelievable  letters come in about that cartoon.  Their argument will probably be...  Because it sounds like it's just a nasty...  Let's be honest.  It sounds like an Obama slam.  That's what it sounds like.  Right.  But their argument will probably be, no, it wasn't intended to be that.  It was about how stupid the bill was and how much whatever is in it or how much...  Everyone knows, reading that, exactly what it looks like.  Yeah.  The cartoon has the dead chimp on the ground with bullet holes in it and blood everywhere. 
[00:54:00]  Cop that just fired the weapon.  Another cop there and it says they have to find someone...  They'll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill.  Yeah.  That's insane.  Wow.  That is a firing right there.  I would never even say that, like, on the air.  Hell no.  You'd be fired in a second.  When I said that, Anthony's face looked at me like, what are you, nuts?  I'm like, Jimmy, are you making that up?  Please tell me that you saw that somewhere. 
[00:54:30]  That was my thought.  Yeah, that's the...  How else could this be taken?  The only way they can spin that...  I know you just explained it, but I still don't see it.  That ain't going to work.  Spin it?  How?  The only thing they could possibly say is, well, because the bill was so poorly written,  we don't look at it.  Like, they'll take the high road and go, what?  No, we didn't mean that.  Why would you think?  They'll put the onus on the people who think that's what they mean.  It won't matter.  I agree.  There's going to be outrage. 
[00:55:00]  I'm still trying to figure out another angle on this.  Wow.  That he's just stupid.  That the chimp, you know, is not the smartest thing.  It's just whatever.  And they shot him.  And now you've got to find someone else to come up with this stupid stimulus bill.  Right.  That'll be their angle.  But if you look at it, it seems very racist.  Or just the fact that he was shot.  Yeah, that's another thing.  Just the fact that he's being shot.  And, you know, you're talking about a president. 
[00:55:30]  You know what?  I think this has legs, Jimmy.  You found something today.  I'm sure a million people saw it.  I don't see it any other way.  But it's not even like, it doesn't outrage me at all.  It's just like, that was kind of a weird one.  I wouldn't have made that tie-in.  That's just a bizarre tie-in.  Who let that go through?  Someone's getting fired.  You watch.  That's a bad one.  Whoever draws those pictures.  I got some experience on this stuff.  That's a bad one for somebody.  Oh, that's going to be a biggie.  You watch how that kind of just takes off today. 
[00:56:00]  You watch the letters to the editor.  That'll start it.  Can we link that to onaradio.com?  It's not online yet.  And the weird thing is, it doesn't look like it's signed.  Is it?  Okay.  Did somebody slip it in last minute?  Yeah.  That would have been great if somebody just slipped it into the presses at the last minute.  Wait, they usually sign their cartoons?  Yeah.  And this one isn't signed?  It's signed in the bottom right.  Danny found it.  So let's get it online.  Onaradio.com immediately.  This thing.  They're going to say.  And if you see this, try to give me another angle they're going for here. 
[00:56:30]  I don't see any other angle.  That don't look signed.  It kind of looks like Scribble down there, but.  No.  They're going to make it look like the outrage should be on anybody that would think we meant that.  Guarantee that's what they're going to say.  All right.  But what?  That doesn't work with radio personalities.  Right.  Oh, we'd be so fired.  So utterly fired.  We wouldn't even be allowed to finish our show.  They'd come in here, even though there's no corporate people here.  They'd find a way into this building and get us off the air.  Let's say hi to Ryan in Atlanta.  Ryan. 
[00:57:00]  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  I was going to say that it's not directed at Obama.  It's directed at Congress.  I know.  I understand that.  Yes.  And they were kind of doing all that.  Honestly, I'd love to see them, you know.  Well, maybe if it was a bunch of monkeys.  But I really think it was.  It's one monkey.  Yeah.  It's the stimulus bill.  And the monkey's dead.  The stimulus bill is attached to Obama.  Yes.  I mean, when you think stimulus bill now, you think Obama.  You don't think Congress.  Right.  And it's one monkey.  If it was a bunch of monkeys, then you could say, well, then it's Congress. 
[00:57:30]  But that one, wow.  They got some splaining to do.  Yeah, because right now, all you're showing is the bill is put, again, like you said, on  Obama.  That's what I'm saying.  Technically, they'll say, well, who wrote the bill?  Again, they'll put it on Congress and go, that's what we meant.  That only, you know, that's the mentality of a monkey who wrote this.  He didn't write it.  That's what they'll go about.  Everybody knows what the visual is telling you.  But when you have a racial stereotype that's been used offensively for years and years 
[00:58:00]  and years, wow.  Wow.  That's a hard one to skirt, saying that's Congress laying there.  Yeah, you exactly, if someone on the radio or if a comic on late night TV has said that,  man, they shot that chimp dead, wow, looks like they're going to have to get someone else  to write this stimulus package.  You watch how fast there would be a problem.  It sort of happened in Boston.  It sort of happened in Boston.  There was a picture taken where a gorilla got loose from the zoo. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, right, right.  And it was hanging out at a bus stop.  So you had a show up there making some racist jokes about that.  I think they got so fired, right?  So completely and just completely fired.  Couldn't be any more fired than if you got fired, came in, and got fired again.  That's very funny.  So fired.  All right, this guy has another take on the cartoon, Richie and Jackson.  Richie. 
[00:59:00]  Hey, man.  Davey Show.  What's up?  Thanks.  I think what they're trying to get across is the old saying, if you put 100 monkeys in  the room, write the perfect novel.  Oh, boy.  Have you ever heard that before?  No, I've heard a quote that sounds kind of like that, but that isn't the quote.  If a thousand chimps or a thousand monkeys typed for a thousand years, one of them would  actually put out the Bible or something like that.  Like one of them would, by accident, type out the right amount of words and spaces accidentally.  I would take that bet. 
[00:59:30]  Jim got the gist of it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we've all heard that.  Yeah, I would take that bet in a second.  Dude, you know what it is?  Look, it's a comic, one panel comic in a newspaper that no one's going to think that deeply into.  You're going to look at it at the face value, which comes off looking like, oh, boy, what  are they crazy?  Yeah.  That's, wow.  I'm amazed what I'm looking at today.  I'm amazed at this one.  Had they come out, unless they don't see another angle. 
[01:00:00]  At least I finally found something to go over my fireplace.  Unless somebody said, unless there was a public quote recently, because these political  cartoonists are geniuses.  I mean, they really are brilliant guys.  Unless there was a quote where somebody said, what, did a monkey write this or did a chimp  write this?  Right, right.  Unless that was such a public quote done recently, and this is sarcastically addressing that.  That's the only thing that makes sense.  You know what we should do?  You should get, Sam, take a copy of this, go down the street, and go, what does this 
[01:00:30]  mean to you?  Yeah.  And I guarantee, nine out of ten times, they'll go, wow, this is an Obama thing.  That's a great idea.  Let's find out.  That's a really good idea.  Get that idiot out there.  But cut it out of the New York Post, because you don't want them to see it surrounded by a  sure, just have it, just get the cartoon, put it on some white paper, where it just stands  alone.  And I bet you nine out of ten people easily would say, wow, that's crazy.  That looks like they're slamming Obama.  They're like, what do you think of this?  Right.  Read this, and then tell me, what do you think of this? 
[01:01:00]  Right.  They were only suspended for two weeks up there in Boston.  What?  Thank you.  Thank you, Ryan.  Guerrilla got out of the zoo?  Yeah, they suspended those guys for a couple weeks.  It is Boston, though.  They're a little more tolerant with their races.  Of course they are.  Yeah.  They just don't like when you say the mayor's dead.  Well, yeah.  Then you have problems, right?  Forever.  Idiots.  And I made a mistake.  I said 44 dwarves, and everyone's correcting me on instant feedback.  It was 44 kickables.  Ah, right. 
[01:01:30]  Stephen S. from Basher came up with the kickables thing, and I apologize.  What is this?  He's the artist, Sean DeLonge.  All right, what am I looking at?  Just say it yourself.  Yeah, he's a big artist here.  We're trying to track him down.  If we want to ask him ourselves.  We certainly do.  Yeah.  I want to sound like a flaming lib when he gets on the phone.  I just want to know what his name is.  And I'm offended by this.  I want to see how he reacts.  It's just, I guess the point we're making.  Hours and backs down.  There's different rules.  I mean, radio guys would be fired for this.  Even if we would try to explain, no, we were actually doing this. 
[01:02:00]  It doesn't matter.  But it's a different set of rules for people in journalism and on TV and everywhere else.  All right.  More 911 call audio of the chimp attacking that woman up there in Connecticut after the break,  okay?  We'll get right into it after the break.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Do, do, do, do, do, do.  Do, do, do, do, do, do.  Starlight.  Opie and Anthony.  You're welcome.  Thanks for checking us out this morning. 
[01:02:30]  I want to thank Basil Teas.  Yeah.  I just had some of the steak and a fine omelet.  The food's ridiculous.  I'm eating this steak like a chimp eats a face.  It's so good.  Basil Teas, yes.  Are you making me want some steak, sir?  Oh.  Oh, cool.  I asked for that without a no-no's.  Light on the eyes, please.  Get some of that cheek in there, though.  Yeah, well, we got that little cheek.  Little cheek, right?  Little cheek.  Basil Teas, they're part of the new half-off dining program. 
[01:03:00]  What's that about, Stephen?  You know?  You don't know.  $50 certificates for $25.  Nice.  Go to 923krock.com for details.  That sounds like a deal.  And Sam is hitting the street.  What happened?  Just poor Iraq.  Because you were talking to that guy.  What do you mean that guy?  He's been cooking for us for years.  But Iraq just hustled over with the microphone.  And by the time he got there, it was like a minute after he stopped talking to me. 
[01:03:30]  He's just trying to stand there with a microphone over the sausage.  Just awkwardly.  But at least he ran over there.  It was a good effort, young man.  Did you eat anything from over there?  What did you have that wasn't on your diet?  How about what did you have?  Nothing.  What?  You just said that you ate something from over there.  What did you eat?  It was an egg white omelet with asparagus, pepper, onion.  Cheese?  You can have some cheese on it, yeah.  It's kind of meat.  That's what I have.  Cheese is evil, my friend.  Thank you, sweetie.  Cheese is evil.  If you're on a diet.  So good. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  I have a nice piece of it.  It's so damn good.  I would eat cheese every effing day.  Teeny, teeny bit is okay.  I always have a teeny bit.  I have some steak.  I have some steak now, but there's no butter.  Don't cook with any butter.  I like it nice and plain.  All right.  That's how a big boy has it.  Is Sam on the street?  Yes, sir.  Jimmy found something in the paper today, if you want to call it a paper.  Some people still call it a paper.  I certainly don't.  I call it a coser blade.  What did you find there, Jimmy?  I am to read it to you.  Why don't we reset this thing, and then Sam is going to be on the street to get some comments 
[01:04:30]  from the everyday Joe.  Well, it's a...  Also known as the average Joe.  The everyday Joe, yes.  John L. Citizen.  Right.  It's two cops, the cartoon in the New York Post, and they've shot, and there's the chimp laying  with two bullet holes in him, and the caption is, they'll have to find someone else to write  the next stimulus bill.  Yeah.  Which, now you know that they have some other explanation for it, but on the surface, it 
[01:05:00]  looks like it's just an Obama slam.  There's no way to spin it where it doesn't look like that at first sight.  Right at first sight, and it takes a real stretch of the imagination to put it somewhere else  where it isn't a racial slam on Obama.  Yep.  Good luck.  And there's a shooting in the cartoon, which is the chimp laying in the bullet holes in them.  And what was the other one they found, Iraq?  To me, this other one is different. 
[01:05:30]  Iraq found another one by the same guy.  And there's a reporter talking with a clothespin on his nose, and there's a jackass, the symbol  of Democrats.  Iraq.  And Obama.  And Obama, he's surrounded by donkeys.  And he's pointing to a paper that says stimulus bill, and it's got, like, dollar signs on it.  And the caption reads, first it was New Jersey, and now it seems to be a mysterious odor originating  out of Washington, D.C.  But that, to me, just means that the stimulus bill stinks. 
[01:06:00]  Right.  And that's an obvious...  Yeah, you can at least explain that one away.  Oh, yeah, that's what it means.  It is tying the stimulus bill to Obama, also.  Right.  Yes, it's Obama.  That's a good point.  Obama is, yes.  It's his baby.  Yeah.  This guy is not a fan of the stimulus bill.  That's all well and good, but...  I'm not a fan of his job, either.  The editors wanted to approve this.  He's suggesting some pretty heavy things in this cartoon today.  And we're going to go down to the street with Sam and see what people are saying about  it.  Maybe we're wrong.  Maybe they'll see something that's a bit different. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  But let's get back to, speaking of the chimp story, it's the big news today.  The chimp that ate the owner's friend up there in Connecticut.  Ate her face and ripped her arm off.  And we're in the middle of the 911 calls.  All right.  Or one big 911 call.  And we continue with this.  It'll be fine.  Opie's going to go chimp on that CD player. 
[01:07:00]  Why'd bother?  And the rest of it will be in the corner just eating the buttons.  Where are we at with the CD player today?  Why are we talking about the same crap every day?  Stump Brain will stab him and then call 911.  Opie needs to be shot.  Eli said he came in and checked it out, or Tim said Eli checked it out and apparently  fixed it or replaced it.  Oh, cool.  So it's fixed.  It wasn't replaced.  All right.  We'll try this again.  We're in the middle of the chimp 911 call. 
[01:07:30]  Is this your monkey or whose monkey is it?  It's your monkey.  It's mine.  Do you know how big it is?  How many pounds?  200 pounds.  400?  200.  200 pounds?  Listen to me, please.  Where are they?  Where are they?  And he's a chimp, correct?  Yes.  Where are they?  They're going your way.  They're going as fast as they can your way, okay?  Please.  Please go faster.  Please.  Please.  Please.  Please.  Please. 
[01:08:00]  Is the monkey still by your friend, or can you get close to your friend?  He's eating her.  He's eating her.  Please.  God, no, please.  Oh, my God.  That is pretty disturbing.  Oh, my God.  He's eating.  She's just got to stand there and watch this chimp eating her friend while she waits to hear,  you know, the sirens coming.  What the F is wrong with this lady?  She could have been a YouTube sensation.  Pick up a camera.  Oh, God.  It's the YouTube generation.  What's wrong with you? 
[01:08:30]  There's nothing you can do for your friend.  You might as well make a nice video for everybody.  What do you think, chimp eating face bigger than little David coming home from the dentist?  Yes, combine the two and you've got a winner.  Am I not going to have a face forever?  Dude, the chimp video would be bigger than Dance Dance Revolution, whatever the hell that  video was called.  Star Wars Kid.  It would be bigger than the otters holding hands.  It would be bigger, yes, Star Wars Kid.  Yeah, yeah.  The dentist kid all doped up.  It would beat everything.  Everything out there.  Have you ever heard a better, I've never heard, more desperation. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, I didn't like that at all.  That is.  I've never heard.  Yeah.  Like, you can picture yourself standing there watching someone you love be attacked and  you know there's nothing you can do.  You can't fight that thing off.  Yeah.  And you know it's not eating her with a little knife and fork and nice little tidbit slices.  That is just, yeah.  Jimmy just made a funny motion with his hands and mouth.  No, I mean consuming, you know, eating her with, he's tearing flesh out with those teeth. 
[01:09:30]  So, and she's watching her friend laying there being consumed.  We're going to have even more audio of the chimp lady.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  What is that?  Well, we're going to have it soon.  Let me see.  Well, we need people to listen to our show, so I'm not even going to say what it is.  It's all about Q, my friend. 
[01:10:00]  All about keeping them tuned into our show.  But we will give you the, you know, some of the highlights of Chimp Lady speaking out.  Okay, here we go.  The final part of the 911 call worth playing today.  They tell them they got to shoot him because I tried stabbing him and he's not, and it made  him worse.  Okay.  Have them shoot him.  They will.  Sandra, I really have the fire department close by, okay? 
[01:10:30]  So as soon as the police gets there, the fire department is going to move in, okay?  Please tell them.  Shoot him because he's going to try to attack me now.  Just breathe, Sandra.  Shoot him!  Shoot him!  Sandra, stay in your car.  Shoot him!  Sandra, I need you to stay in your car.  Shoot him, please.  I tried stabbing him, and he's hurt now, too.  So he's going to attack anybody.  I can't get out of this car.  Oh, my God. 
[01:11:00]  She was in the car.  Yeah, she's in the car watching the whole thing from her car.  Why didn't she run the damn thing over?  I know.  Maybe she didn't have keys.  She might have just jumped in the car.  Maybe their friend had the keys.  He had the keys.  Oh, the monkey had the keys?  Yeah, this whole thing started when the monkey grabbed the keys, ran out of the house, and  was pounding on the car because that's how he told her he wanted to go for a ride.  Goddamn monkey.  He just wanted to go for a ride?  That's how it started.  The monkey had the keys.  And the lady came up, and then he attacked her, not recognizing her.  Hi, how are you? 
[01:11:30]  She had a gift for the chimp in the car, too?  Oh, of course she did.  You always bring a gift for the stupid chimp.  But he thought the gift was a face cake.  I'd like a limb below the elbow, please.  And our new Fudgy the Face.  We got Friend the Faceless.  Wow.  Dude, that audio just gave me chills.  Not the first part, but the one we just played coming back. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, the real desperation.  I thought that one was even worse.  That one we just played.  It's terrible.  I didn't know she was in a car watching it from right there.  Is this your monkey, or whose monkey is it?  Who cares who's a monkey at this point?  It's not a monkey, technically.  It's a great ape.  200 pounds.  400?  200.  200 pounds?  Listen to me, please.  Where are they?  Where are they?  And he's a chimp, correct?  Yes.  Where are they?  They're going your way.  They're going as fast as they can your way, okay? 
[01:12:30]  Please.  Please go faster.  Please.  Please, Derek.  Please.  Please.  Is the monkey still by your friend, or can you get close to your friend?  Say pretty, please.  He's eating her.  Please.  God, oh, please.  I nominate this.  He's eating her.  I nominate this greatest 911 call ever.  Yeah, that is a good one.  You can find me a better one than this.  This has all the features.  Dude, I didn't realize that she was right there.  I thought she was in the house, and she ran in the house. 
[01:13:00]  I guess she was stabbing the monkey, and he hit her or whatever, and then she just jumped  in the car.  Yeah, she jumped in the car.  And he went back to the friend.  Yeah.  To finish her off.  To start, yeah.  Second course.  Hmm.  Arm.  Can you imagine, like, this thing that you've raised as a pet, like, you know that when  it's done with her, it's going to kill you?  Yeah.  Ugh.  Jesus.  And it has the keys.  That's why it's worse than a pit bull or a...  It has the...  It knows how to use the keys.  She thought...  Yeah.  She was saying, it's going to come from me. 
[01:13:30]  She knows.  That chimp knows how to open that goddamn door.  Or he could break the window.  I'm sure the chimp could break the window.  Yeah, break the window.  Without even trying.  So she couldn't go anywhere.  Oh, that is a hell of a situation.  That's a nightmare situation.  Someone is yelling...  Blue Heeler, he's a regular, he goes, why isn't she, like, honking the horn?  Maybe that'll distract the chimp.  Start beeping the horn.  She stabbed it.  Might bring other people out for him to, you know...  Right.  A real dinner bell.  And she stabbed the chimp in a...  What do you think, a horn's going to make him run away? 
[01:14:00]  Who knows?  Who loves the horn?  Well, try it.  Try everything.  He thinks it himself all the time.  She thought her friend was dead.  And if she honks the horn and then it turns around and comes to her, she's next.  That's true.  Yeah.  Let her keep eating your friend.  Right.  Yeah, that's true.  And I think she was sprinkling, like, salt and pepper on her friend out the window.  Throwing banana things in her friend's mouth.  Pureing a monkey chow all over her.  That was the problem.  Her friend was wearing Charro's hat.  The chimp wanted some bananas and grapes. 
[01:14:30]  Charro's hat.  Good reference.  Charro.  At least he didn't go with the other one from way back when.  What was her name?  Carmen Miranda.  Carmen Miranda.  I wouldn't have known.  I remember the computer game.  Where in the world is Carmen Santiago?  And my mother bought me that thinking it would be fun.  Yeah.  And I threw it in her face and bit her nose off.  It's educational.  You went chimp on her.  I wanted to go for a ride.  He has the keys and knows how to use them.  That is, you're absolutely right.  That's worse than a pit bull because it has an opposable thumb and it can open a car door with the keys. 
[01:15:00]  You can't lock yourself in.  And he's probably a better driver than most women.  Hi-oh.  Oh.  Hi-oh.  Oh.  And once again, all she could hope for is to keep doing that thing where you unlock the door but keep opening the handle.  Hey, stop doing that.  And it doesn't open.  The chimp's getting real mad.  Would you stop doing it?  I'm trying to open the door and eat you. 
[01:15:30]  And once again, Sean in Georgia, who owns a chimp without a gun or tranquilize a gun?  Well, she does.  She apparently just needs a little wine, some Xanax, and a bed.  She slept with this thing.  Could have woke up with her face half-eaten.  Let's, uh, oh, well, let's go to John in Jersey Shore.  John, welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  What do you got?  Hey, guys.  I guess that evil monkey finally got out of Chris Griffin's closet.  A little family guy reference.  I don't like it. 
[01:16:00]  Thank you, John.  You got it.  Let's play that last part of the 911 call again.  The chief from Bayshore has a good Pat from Munaki line.  Yep.  Her friend owned a gun, but she was disarmed.  Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.  God damn it.  Disarmed.  That is a terrifying 911.  You can feel that.  You can smell how afraid she is.  That is awful.  There's another reason to replay this.  Joe from Centery.  She goes, listen closely.  At the end, you do hear the gunshots in the 911 call. 
[01:16:30]  No way.  Because it sounds like she's screaming at one point away from the phone.  Right.  Shoot him.  Shoot him.  Let's listen again.  This is the last part.  They tell them they got to shoot him because I tried stabbing him and he's not, and it made  him worse.  Okay, Sandra.  Have them shoot him.  They will.  Sandra, I really have the fire department close by, okay?  So as soon as the police gets there, the fire department is going to move in, okay?  Please tell them.  Shoot him because he's going to try to attack me now. 
[01:17:00]  Just breathe, Sandra.  Shoot him.  Shoot him.  Sandra, stay in your car.  Shoot him.  Sandra, I need you to stay in your car.  Shoot him, please.  I tried stabbing him, and he's hurt now, too.  So he's going to attack anybody.  I can't get out of this car.  I don't really hear it.  Do you?  I didn't hear anything.  I didn't hear no gunshots.  Liar, liar, pants on fire.  You tried Joe in Centery.  Yeah, liar, liar, and a diaper on fire. 
[01:17:30]  We didn't hear it.  God, those sounds.  It's amazing how when you're making a 911 call, when there's a 200-pound chimp eating  your friend, all social graces go out the window.  She's just making guttural noises.  You wonder if her window was open, because it might have been an automatic window lock,  which most of them, no one has rolled up windows anymore.  So if that window wasn't closed... 
[01:18:00]  Oh, she was probably afraid it was going to come and jump in the window at her.  Just jump in, and maybe it was, but then again, she is screaming.  She should be whispering.  Ixnay.  Yeah.  Well, PETA got involved.  This is the update on the story.  Oh, good.  This story still has legs.  Unlike the friend.  Yeah.  Near the scene of the attack, a man left bouquets of flowers, and a relative of the Chippan Z's  owner spoke briefly.  She's getting phone calls from PETA, and people are making threatening phone calls, saying  she killed Travis. 
[01:18:30]  But it's not what she did, the relatives said.  And Heather Carlson, communications assistant manager for PETA, refuted the claim that her  organization made threatening phone calls to the Chimpanzee's owner.  The allegations that PETA has made harassing and or threatening phone calls is simply not  true.  Oh, people are so stupid.  PETA would get involved because it's a chimpanzee.  The organization other people are talking about here on PalTalk has no reason to get involved.  So just stop it. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, listen.  Well, listen to the jerk.  Frank, Frank.  What's up, Frank?  Hey, guys.  What's funny?  Welcome aboard, Frank.  Hey, Jim.  What's funny about this?  What's funny about this?  It's...  Correct, Jim.  What's funny about this?  I think what's funny is that your call will end with a frunkus.  All right.  What's funny about the audio?  Frunkus.  Just give it to us.  Come on.  We're on to you.  I'm asking you a question.  I'm not giving you anything I'm asking. 
[01:19:30]  What's funny about the audio?  I think that it's fun to poke fun at something that is so bizarre.  We have audio of a chimp eating a lady.  So we kind of have to address it comedically, sir.  It doesn't usually happen.  It's not something that doesn't happen very often.  It's chilling.  Yeah.  It's very, very...  We're talking about how traumatic-sounding it is, but then you've got to add in the dark  humor because the truth of the matter is this doesn't happen a lot.  Right.  And the whole beast versus human thing, you know, that's where the jokes are.  Go ahead.  Frunkus, please. 
[01:20:00]  Fair enough.  You gave me a good explanation.  And I also...  Let me ask...  Let me ask you a question.  Yes, Jim.  Yes, Jim.  What is wrong with this guy?  I want to smack you.  I don't know what his deal is.  I want to eat his face.  What's funny about the audio?  Actually, nothing.  See, to me, that's what humor is, is you find humor.  You laugh at things that aren't funny.  See, that's to me what, quote-unquote, the gift of humor is.  It's the ability to laugh at things which are truly horrific.  If it was just audio...  That's what our listeners do every day.  Of course they do.  Laugh at things that aren't funny. 
[01:20:30]  We make fun of sexism, racism, murder, all those things.  That's the way you look at them without going crazy.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough, sir.  Plus, the monkey makes funny sounds.  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  Fair enough.  Very good.  Thank you, Frank.  That's it.  Just ask the question.  You got my answer.  Thank you very much.  All right, Frank.  All right, bye.  Oh, wait, Frank.  I guess he was for real, huh?  Get it.  Oh, it doesn't matter.  I was sure he was going to frunk us.  I thought he was trying to goof on that call the other day. 
[01:21:00]  That was all upset.  And this, once again, the owner said Travis was acting rambunctious Monday.  She even tried to calm him by giving his Xanax pill and a cup of tea.  The chimp's having tea with the lady.  What's he getting?  What the hell?  Probably it was green tea with caffeine in it, mouthful of steak.  Mouth full of face.  We're going to eat more steak.  Hey, where's Sam?  And so I guess we're not doing this live?  I thought we were going to do it live. 
[01:21:30]  Whatever.  We should, yeah.  He'll come back with some audio.  Cell phone.  He can do it with a cell phone, right?  I think he's just, well, I don't think he got the.  Oh, he's out there with a record.  So he looks legit.  He's got like a microphone with a mic flag and everything.  We kind of wanted to do it live, but.  Yeah.  He's probably collecting on out.  Oh, you haven't gone yet?  No, I just went.  Oh, and what'd you get?  I go get it right after the break.  How is it?  It's a couple of good.  I mean, people know what it is.  Are they angry? 
[01:22:00]  They don't want it.  Yeah, they don't want to say what it is, but they know.  Oh, they don't want to say.  Look at this.  Boy.  Are they taking our angle?  Yeah, they know.  They know.  They say no comment or I won't talk about that.  Wow.  All right.  Let's get the audio on the air after the break.  Scared society.  Oh, but they didn't know it was a post cartoon, though.  Wow.  No, no, no, no.  Got time for a kiss?  Hmm?  All right, good.  Let's say hi to Nick in Jersey.  Nick?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  I just got to say, man, that was disturbing.  I'm driving to work and listening to that.  I almost threw up my bagel, man. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, it's really disturbing, man.  Yeah.  I mean, what's going to happen to this lady, this poor lady with her face chewed off?  She's so done.  You don't know?  Yeah.  I'd rather die than have that happen.  I mean, not that I have much to look at now, but she's lost both her eyes, too, right?  She's in critical condition.  Both of her eyes?  Did he gouge her eyes out?  Why did she stab the monkey's eyes out?  Yeah, I think she's got, like, no face left.  Oh, my God.  That's horrible.  That is so horrible.  It rips her face.  I'm, like, disturbed.  I can't even work right now. 
[01:23:00]  At least if you have your eyes, you still have your perspective of things.  You might look horrific, but you still, like, everything still looks the same to you.  At least you don't have to look at the way people are looking at you.  Oh, my God.  You know?  And just to witness that and watch that, I mean, that poor lady, that poor lady.  It's just amazing.  I want to beat up every chimp that I've ever seen.  Hey, hey.  Dude, the chimp had Lyme disease.  I mean, chimps are a nice animal.  It's a chimp's fault.  They do that to each other in the wild.  That's how they fight. 
[01:23:30]  It's not the chimp's fault that we're pussies.  I know.  I understand that.  But still, man.  I mean, why would you even have a chimp?  It's a wild animal.  I mean, keep them in the wild.  How old was the victim?  What happens when you try to have them?  Old.  How old was the victim?  55, 55?  Perhaps she had a hat on that he wanted removed.  Or a banana hat or something like that.  Shut it.  The first thing is a banana hat, you silly goose.  Otherwise, that would be the joke all day.  Banana hat, banana, banana hat.  Banana hat.  Yeah, but you know what?  All animals are wild. 
[01:24:00]  I mean, we domesticated dogs, but you know what they do in Africa?  They're pack animals.  They run around.  They just eat stuff.  Yes.  They're awful.  Any animal we have is technically a wild.  People have birds.  They're wild animals.  They just...  Take your eyes out.  They sure would.  Horrible things.  Yeah.  I mean, all animals.  Fish are wild animals.  Yes.  They just can't, you know, corner you in a driveway and eat your face.  But you go down there and go scuba diving and come across an angry one. 
[01:24:30]  They'll get you.  They'll nip at you.  They'll nip you.  Someone is really...  Oh, it's Joe again in center reach saying BS.  There's another one minute or so of audio.  You hear her saying he's not dead.  Keep shooting.  Where's that?  Why?  This guy swears it's radio gold and he's showing us the site that it's on so we can find that.  It's gold, Jerry.  Where you can hear gunshots and everything.  So maybe we're not done with the 911 audio.  We'll see what Sam gathered.  Also, people are asking about this funniest listener contest.  What's this about there? 
[01:25:00]  Stunt brain.  Give it a quick plug.  Yeah.  It's at Comics.  It's a week from Friday.  If you're interested, you can go to onaradio.com.  We need a minute of sample audio from you.  We've already got quite a few.  About that 911 call.  Yeah.  I don't know if we can get the lady down there.  Yeah.  But there'll be Rich Voss hosting, you guys judging, and we're giving away a 46-inch screen high-def big TV.  Very good.  I'm not even going to go there.  Is this verified? 
[01:25:30]  Did the chimp actually sleep with Shona Lene?  Because the reports are coming in.  I left her a nice Facebook message.  Did you?  Yeah.  Well, that poor lady can't ever go on Facebook again.  That's funny.  She's starting her own.  It's like, look, people have to tell her gently, look, we understand that you've been injured,  but mush book is not going to catch on.  Mush book.  Oh, God damn.  No, look, we understand, but you used to have a Facebook is a copyright infringement. 
[01:26:00]  Meatloaf book.  Look.  Yes.  No, my face is not taking over my spray.  We hate to tell you.  Oh, damn.  What kind of message did you leave her?  Video message?  Oh, no.  I left a message on Facebook because she has a lot of pictures there, one of which has,  let's see, remnants of a very nice experience that a gentleman might have and where he leaves 
[01:26:30]  remnants.  Like if you're making a cake and you splattered cake batter on someone's face.  Right.  It's something like that, strudel icing.  It has that same consistency and it looks like she was eating it very sloppily.  This is on her Facebook?  Strudel icing.  Yes.  Facial book.  And she had a problem with us.  And she had a problem and it says, and it tells who, where, what, like all the info's 
[01:27:00]  there and she's smiling and her little signature for the day was, well, I'm listening to a porno  being filmed next door.  I think this sounds a porno.  So I was just like, oh, you know, calling her a hypocrite and this and saying, oh, I  hope daddy's proud of you.  I let her have it as far as daddy being proud.  Does he like the thought of a big mm-mm in your face?  And I just got brutal. 
[01:27:30]  Brutal.  Are the listeners left messages?  Oh, yeah.  Boy, they're having fun with her Facebook or YouTube video.  She makes you not a friend anymore, though.  She will make you not a friend.  But there's been a few responses.  Oh, you can still comment on the YouTube video.  Yeah, I wish I could find it.  That she made a response to her crying on our show on Friday.  I'll see if I could.  For people that haven't heard.  I'll see if I could find it.  You're among friends, Travis.  Because I did leave her this message.  It's fab.  It really is. 
[01:28:00]  Somebody decided to put a picture of two little mice drinking out of a water bowl.  They're probably thirsty.  I don't know what that means.  I don't understand it.  I don't care.  I don't know these mice.  I don't know what that beverage is.  Hmm.  It might have been removed already.  She may have removed my wonderful post.  And, yeah, I posted on a picture and on her main page.  So I'll look for it.  I will find it.  It's also Black History Month.  Let's see who we're looking at today.  Yes.  We'll continue with more 9-1-1 audio on what Sam gathered on the street. 
[01:28:30]  To celebrate Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is recognizing those historic African Americans without whom this country would not be the melting pot it is today.  Today, we honor Private 8-Ball from the 1987 Stanley Kubrick Vietnam War film, Full Metal Jacket.  Even overseas, African Americans were discriminated against by private business owners, citing skin color as an issue for refusal of goods and services.  However, 8-Ball persevered and showed this young lady his tremendous rhetorical skills and ultimately changed her mind. 
[01:29:00]  What we have here, sister, is a magnificent specimen of pure Alabama black snake, but it ain't too goddamn beaucoup.  Okay.  Okay.  Stay tuned for more icons of black history on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Weird times.  Weird times.  Some brains give us a little lesson on socialism during the break. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, great.  You commie.  Oh, no, no.  I'm anti.  Oh.  Anti-socialist.  I know you're anti-socialist.  You scared me for a second there.  Do-do-do-do.  Just living in weird times.  How bad is it going to get, though?  We have no idea.  We see all this crap happening around us, but the full effect won't be out there for a while, right?  What is GM talking about?  47,000 jobs they're going to get rid of unless they get some help? 
[01:30:00]  No, they're saying even if they get help.  They're saying if we give them more help, they're going to fire another 47,000 people.  They're asking for more money now.  How do you screw up that bad?  How do we give, why are we giving them any, I guess, because no one's buying cars?  You know what it is?  No one's buying cars.  They didn't see the economic downfall that's been happening, like a lot of people.  And people are having trouble getting financing for cars. 
[01:30:30]  Well, the scumbag banks are not going to do anything to help anybody.  They're not going to do anything to help anybody.  Well, they got all this money from the government that was supposed to be for loaning to people,  you know, people that are safe to loan to, not like when they were just loaning to anybody.  Yeah.  And apparently they're not loaning that out either.  They're just kind of hoarding it and using it.  Of course.  So, yeah, still in a weird situation.  They want a little more accountability with these companies that they're giving this money to. 
[01:31:00]  Good luck.  We're waiting for more 911 audio.  Yeah, why do we have it?  By the way, it's Snowball.  Everyone's saying it's Snowball, not 8-Ball Steve.  Oh, of course.  That was a Freudian slip.  Snowball.  Private Snowball.  He was the one that informed us that Kennedy was shot from the book suppository.  Yeah.  What, Iraq?  No, no, no, what?  You was fine.  What were you doing?  Let's get it out.  I had asked him that this morning when he was previewing it.  I was like, isn't that wrong? 
[01:31:30]  And he swore up and down that.  Wait, wait, wait.  Snowball was the guy in boot camp.  8-Ball is a different guy.  The other guy was the guy that was trying to get 2-Bucu.  Yeah, those are two different guys.  You're right.  Maybe Steve's right.  I'm not sure if his name is 8-Ball.  All right.  8-Ball and Snowball.  I bet you Steve's right because he had to play the audio to get it, so he must have gotten the name right.  More importantly, do you have any more good rumors today, Iraq? 
[01:32:00]  Not yet.  Making everyone into a panicky peak the last couple of days?  Yeah, anything, Iraq?  Anything you want to add to the demise of us?  Yeah, of everything, whatever.  Stupid.  Goddamn gaggle.  Go to a quilting bee and talk to the other women.  I was talking to an intern at Z100, and there's some changes going down.  He is the worst, Iraq.  He really is.  There's no changes.  Harbinger of doom.  You know what?  I like it better when there's food in your mouth.  You can't spout your babble when you're eating. 
[01:32:30]  I never heard rumors about raises or anything fun.  No.  No, it's always bad.  Unless it's his weight.  All right.  All right.  There goes that hat again.  Tip back and forth.  I know.  Waka waka.  No.  No, stop it.  We play this now.  This is a fun little clip.  Let us know.  We do this now.  Wow, that celebrity apprentice looks like it's going to be really good.  Yeah.  Anyone seen the commercials?  I have.  Oh, wow. 
[01:33:00]  It looks good.  It does?  Yeah.  You're not being sarcastic?  No.  Yeah?  No.  Dice is in rare form.  Joan Rivers is losing her mind.  I hear Dice.  Melissa Rivers.  One episode.  Yeah, because they're stupid.  And they give him the boot.  They're stupid.  If they actually give him the boot after one episode, they aren't as dumb as they come.  Sounds like that's exactly what they did.  Nah.  So, that starts what?  Soon, huh?  When does that start?  The 1st of March.  Don't embarrass everybody.  I cannot even explain how uninterested I am in any reality show. 
[01:33:30]  I cannot sit and watch that formula anymore.  It's the same effing show.  All these shows.  The same thing.  The long delay after you ask him a question.  The ominous music.  The question that gets interrupted by the commercial.  Then they come back and have to go through the whole part again where they ask the question.  It's like, I hate reality programming. 
[01:34:00]  It's formula.  It's the same garbage every single show.  Why they're throwing this one out.  Why they're keeping this one.  The long explanations.  The crying bitches.  The same.  I hate reality programming.  I agree with you, but they're still eating it up.  Do you know that they're still doing Survivor?  Who's watching that?  It still does really well.  I used to love Survivor.  I was one of those people.  Everyone did like season one. 
[01:34:30]  I don't think I've watched it.  They don't even call them seasons anymore.  They're what?  The cycles.  Because they're doing like two a year at this point.  Probably five or six I haven't seen.  It was new and original when it started.  And I ate that crap up.  I couldn't get enough of that Survivor.  But then, you know, I was into the first couple of seasons of The Real World because they actually got real people, left them in the house for a long ass time.  To make things develop. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, to make things happen.  And then it just became this casted show.  It's like that goddamn Laguna Beach or the OC where it's all the beautiful people just sitting around in hot tubs.  What happened, they got lazy.  It used to be The Real World House was something like six months.  They had a camp out in the basement.  They were bored half the time just to get a few seconds of really good video.  Now they just give these kids alcohol and who knows what else to get the situations moving quick.  And they're only in the house like a month, month and a half now. 
[01:35:30]  And the guys, they're all trying too hard to be something they're not.  So the guys are all these, you know, hey, I'm a player.  Let me get in with this.  And they're making out with all the girls in the hot tub.  And it's just like, it's so phony.  Where they go, you, like if it's who has to leave, step forward, you.  And they're like, will he stay or go?  Stay.  The big smile and the other music plays. 
[01:36:00]  It's the same formula.  I hate reality programming.  I can't watch it.  I was watching one the other day.  It's called The Tool something.  Oh, yeah.  Tool, because they're all tools.  And it's not even a real brick in the background.  It's so obviously like a fake background against the wall, like a fake castle.  It's so bad.  What?  If you watch all the reality shows, you can see they're recycling houses now.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they got certain houses are used in multiple shows.  The Teen Idol show that's on VH1 is using the house that they used for the last season of The Real World in Hollywood. 
[01:36:30]  And like VH1, all those Flavor of Love and all the different shows, it's the same house redecorated.  That's fantastic.  Rules.  Are you a fan of the reality program?  See, you've got to be younger.  Get out of here.  I'm telling you.  It's got to be entertaining.  But there are plenty of younger people that think it stinks on ice, too.  But you know what, though?  If it sucked that bad, it would be off TV. 
[01:37:00]  I'm telling you.  You know why it's not on TV?  These 20-somethings are eating this reality.  They're all programming still.  There are plenty of people that watch it, and it's dirt cheap to make.  That's why there's so many on.  Believe me.  That's why.  And people are watching it, but that doesn't mean it doesn't suck.  It sucks!  There's no residuals, really, for these guys.  No.  The amount of money they save on paying actors and writers.  I mean, the minimal amount of writing.  And even crew.  But we're talking to a fan right here.  Sam, why do you watch reality programs? 
[01:37:30]  There's something exciting about reality TV.  But it's not reality.  It's all...  They cast these things.  They bring people in.  They should then take...  Let me tell you what reality programming should be, then.  The first...  If they need 10 people, the first 10 people through the door should get the gig.  Yeah, but they're boring.  I don't want to see them.  Exactly.  That's reality.  I don't want to see...  No, I want...  The second you start auditioning these people and asking them questions and how you'd react to this,  and do you get along with this, then it's not... 
[01:38:00]  It's not reality anymore.  You've got to make a videotape.  It's assisted reality.  Yeah, you've got to make a videotape and sell yourself.  Assisted off TV.  You know what reality programming I like?  First 48.  Those are cops running around murder scenes.  That's fun television, my friend.  That's reality programming.  Are you a fan of...  What's the show called?  Tool...  Tool Academy.  Tool Academy?  It stinks.  Yeah, I watch it.  You do?  It's awful, man.  I saw some.  It's terrible.  Why do you watch Tool Academy?  It's a really funny show.  Really?  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  Because they're tools?  Yeah, because they're tools.  All right.  And they're all different types of tools.  Do you watch Bromance?  No, I haven't started watching...  I hear there's a homo undercone.  Bromance?  Brody Jenner.  You haven't heard of Bromance?  No!  They were saying in the paper today that they're not even, like, hiding the homoeroticism.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I might have to tune in there.  Do you watch Bromance?  No, that's Brody Jenner from The Hills' show, and I'm not into The Hills.  The Hills.  Because that's a girl show, right?  That's a girl show.  I'm not going to watch The Hills.  It's a little different, right, Sam?  By the way, I saw a trailer yesterday for... 
[01:39:00]  He just doesn't...  He's just not that into you?  He's just not that whatever you're into.  Yeah.  And knowing that you saw this, the first thing that popped into my head was, oh, my God.  I can't believe Sam sat through this.  The trailer was embarrassing to watch.  I was sitting there alone watching it.  Were you uncomfortable?  Yes.  It was the douchiest chill. 
[01:39:30]  There couldn't have been one moment of enjoyment for you in that movie.  I mean, it's the douchey chill movie.  That is all it is.  It's horrible.  It's completely predictable.  Now I've got to go see it.  I have to go see it.  Oh, it's just girls hugging.  And I think...  Is there a scene where they kind of do a little dance?  Yeah, there's a few dances.  Oh.  I'm going to have to go see it, man.  I know.  Just to goof on it.  How about assisted reality, chimps and regular people? 
[01:40:00]  Your face is being eaten.  I've watched that.  You have to leave the house.  You're dead.  There's only one reality show I still watch.  What?  Biggest Loser.  Oh, I never saw it now.  I watched The Biggest Loser.  Who cares about the fatties?  Fatties losing weight every week.  Speaking of which, have an omelet, sir.  Yeah, I watched The Biggest Loser. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, a holy roller on Pal Talk.  Go die!  What happened?  I don't know.  There's some holy roller on Pal Talk telling us to repent.  You don't watch any reality shows, is it?  No, I don't watch...  Well, 48.  That's a reality show.  You know what?  Is that considered a reality show?  It should be.  Is it?  It's more or less documentary.  It's documentary. 
[01:41:00]  These other reality shows have prizes involved.  Give me the top TV shows.  I want to see if I watch any of these programs.  First 48 is very good.  It's a documentary.  Yeah, it's on the ID channel.  Yes.  Investigative documentary show.  It's an ID channel?  Yeah.  And the other one is The Ship, which has gotten a lot better.  You'd really like that.  That's another one, which they investigate murders and stuff.  The investigators are just heartless with these guys.  They grab them and say, if you lie to me, I will effing bury you.  See, that's good stuff. 
[01:41:30]  Good stuff.  Good stuff.  I don't like reality shows because they're too formulated.  Try bromance, at least.  I will not try bromance.  On Tool Academy, they're all there with their girlfriends.  And in the middle of, while they were talking with their girlfriends, one of the tools,  real girlfriend came in and said, I've been dating that guy for seven years.  Wow.  It was great.  It was fake.  What?  No, no.  It's so fake.  It's all fake, phony, set up garbage.  Reality programming ended years ago. 
[01:42:00]  Did you watch the show?  I caught the last one where the guy had to choose between the hot chick and his mom.  What the hell was that show called?  Oh, stop it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was called Easiest Decision Ever.  I mean, you see mom getting booted out.  I was laughing my ass off at how ridiculous this show was.  It's all these mommy boys.  Mama boys.  It's called Mama's Boys.  Mama's Boys.  And then they got all these chicks, too.  And then the mom decides, look, she's not for you. 
[01:42:30]  One of the moms didn't want their son dating anyone who wasn't white.  Yeah.  And so she had a big confrontation with the black girls her first day there and everything.  Yeah.  It was very entertaining how ridiculous it was.  Yeah, that's it.  All right.  People talk about the post-comic.  We also have the chimp owner speaking out.  We got the highlights from her interview.  She just did.  Jesus Christ.  She didn't take a day like Mourn or something.  You know, everyone wants to be famous. 
[01:43:00]  Kind of lying down.  She was just hysterical on the phone.  She's asking for donations for her friend, the funny Groucho Marx, glasses and nose of  her.  And wax lips.  Those big, those big stationery store wax lips.  Yeah.  Why would she go on TV?  She wants to be famous.  That's all.  Oh, God.  What a nightmare.  I would scare you coming around a corner, wouldn't it?  The glasses with the two eyes on the springs hanging out.  Oh, God.  Looks like a Mr. Potato Head done with chopped meat. 
[01:43:30]  A big ball of chopped meat.  I used to watch my Super Sweet 16.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  I used to watch that because that, to me, watching girls being disappointed, crying,  is hysterical.  But they get what they want in the end.  I turn it off before that.  Oh, well, that's smart.  Because then it's a different ending.  I don't want to see them get the car again.  Because that's the same thing, too. 
[01:44:00]  Here it is.  Why don't I get it?  My daddy's supposed to get me this.  And then you look at her going, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch.  And then at the end, the beamer comes rolling out.  And she'd roll right over her and her stupid wigger friends, too.  Because they all are.  Yo, this party be off the hook.  Really?  Pale white kid?  Knock it off.  P. Diddy was at one of them.  Was he?  Yeah.  Well, P. Diddy is an attention whore.  P. Diddy's star is fading so quickly.  His son was on that show.  Wow, really?  Yeah. 
[01:44:30]  How old is he?  20 what?  Super sweet 16.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Okay.  All right, we got the chimp owner.  Let's get into this, because we're running out of show on this side.  I don't know why she would do an interview on TV.  This is, you know, why.  She has a book she's selling.  It's a cookbook.  What you can do with a nose and two eyes.  And a soft cheek.  How to prepare a soft cheek.  Yes, the most delicious part, believe it or not, is the chin.  Yes.  No one would think that, but it is.  I'd like some cleft pudding. 
[01:45:00]  Here we go.  And I went up, went around, and I saw what was going on, and I hollered at him, and he  was just grabbing her, and then I went and got the shovel.  Jesus.  And I was trying to, you know, hit him with the shovel to stop it, and it wasn't working,  and so I went, and I had to get a knife.  And you stabbed him.  I had to.  He looked at me like, Mom, what did you do?  It's not your kid.  It's a child.  It's a horrible thing. 
[01:45:30]  But I'm not a horrible thing.  Wow.  The next track just decided to play there, Stunt Brain.  But why would we fix the CD player?  I've been asking every other day for the last year.  She thinks of that as her child.  Yeah.  She looked at me like, Mom, what did you do?  Well, you're eating my friend's face, son.  Excuse me.  Could you get off my friend, please? 
[01:46:00]  Could you just get off of my friend?  Oh, look at his eyes.  She hit him with, this is what you say about people fighting it.  She stabbed it and hit it with a shovel, and it wouldn't stop.  The cop shot it, and it still ran in the house and died in its cage.  Stupid monkey.  Well, she continues.  It's a horrible thing, but I'm not a horrible person, and he wasn't a horrible chimp. 
[01:46:30]  It was a freak thing.  Animal experts are saying that chimps shouldn't be pets.  They're dangerous.  They're animals, and this is what can happen.  They're the closest thing to human, the closest thing to us.  Their DNA, we can give them a blood transfusion.  They can give us one.  What?  How many people go crazy and kill other people?  This is one incident that I don't know what happened.  One too many.  If a man ate a woman's face, that would be an instance where it would be all over the 
[01:47:00]  news like this.  Yes, people do kill each other on a daily basis, but as far as eating the face like that and  ripping off arms and doing things like that, it's kind of rare.  Cannibals do it.  It has happened.  Oh, sure.  At least the chimp didn't rape her and take her purse or do something.  At least he was just acting instinctively.  I mean, orangutan heart, wasn't that the first heart transplant or one of them?  Was it a private heart?  They put a little baboon heart in a little baby fae, I believe her name was, many years 
[01:47:30]  ago.  She's still alive, right?  Yeah, no.  Come on.  She died very shortly after.  Did she?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  She lived like maybe a week.  I couldn't have been wrong.  Yes.  I could not have been baby fae.  Oh, my God.  Didn't she just enroll in college?  No, she died three days later.  She's like dead in no time.  I was complete.  Wasn't there someone that survived with that?  Not with a baby fae.  They did a couple of the baboon heart things, but it just doesn't work.  I think the anti-rejection drugs for that just don't even friggin' work. 
[01:48:00]  And what is this transfusion stuff with a chimp?  I've never heard of that.  You never see chimps at the Red Cross giving out blood?  Give me a break.  You try to take blood from a chimp.  Chimp laying there eating a cookie and some juice.  I'll tell you why.  Just lounging around.  They show up to donate because they do care.  But they're too rambunctious and naughty afterwards, and they start tearing everybody's IV out and throwing fecal matter around the room.  The feces make a very unsterile environment. 
[01:48:30]  Can you not do that, please?  Just take a syringe in.  We're trying to collect blood here.  You're a problem.  Can you leave now?  Chimp owner continues.  How long was that before the attack that you gave him the Xanax?  Five minutes, if that.  Do you think the Xanax had some kind of...  Oh, no.  Five minutes?  So she gave the chimp the Xanax five minutes before it went crazy?  Yeah.  Oh, see?  He was already being crazy.  You've got to let that settle in a little bit.  Oh, this next clip is terrific.  I used to buy everything for him.  Everything.  I mean, he was filet mignon, lobster tails, lit chocolate. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, champagne, champagne, got the...  Hey, monkey could have his own family.  He climbed the Empire State Building with his father.  Monkey, I don't remember.  Monkey, I don't know.  They said Travis ate the nose.  Travis ate the...  I don't know.  I don't remember. 
[01:49:30]  Travis, five angels.  He obviously didn't like any of that stuff.  Apparently not.  Boy, she's spoiled.  This woman, by the way, is a nut.  She is completely out of her effing mind with this chimpanzee.  Enough about the chimp.  He ate well.  He ate chocolate.  And the neighbors in Stanford were familiar with his antics.  It's sometimes about the local police.  Antics, he ate face.  He liked taking rides in cars, I read.  Yeah, he did.  He was able to open doors by himself. 
[01:50:00]  He could drive.  He took off with the car a couple times.  Onto the regular streets?  Yeah.  That seems a little dangerous.  Like an unruly teenager.  That's amazing.  Taking off in the car.  Cops pull him out.  Oh.  Hey, look.  How else are you going to get in?  Of course you have to.  You must have.  You must have.  You tased him.  I would like to see that.  I want to see a chimp being tased.  Can we get that?  Well, they say the problem with him as a driver was that he never had the proper registration. 
[01:50:30]  That was what always got him in trouble.  He always had to grab the Reggie.  He was fine driving.  He just didn't have a license.  He looked real silly at DMV.  Yeah.  In front of the little picture thing to take your picture.  Yeah.  In front of the little.  It's called a camera.  In front of the little picture thing.  In front of the picture thing.  You know, the magic box that makes you out of film.  I was trying to remember the little blue screen that he's got to stand in front of.  I know what a camera is. 
[01:51:00]  I'm an idiot, though.  You're right.  He would drive the car?  Yep.  Amazing.  Wow.  Let's go to Victor in Jersey.  Go to Kentucky Fried Face.  Do you have a nose bucket?  Do you have a bucket of noses?  Yes.  Hello?  Hi.  Hi, Victor.  What's going on, guys?  What's going on?  I just wanted to let you guys know that tranquilizers like Xanax can have a paradoxical on animals, 
[01:51:30]  especially primates.  So maybe that did have something to do with it.  They what?  Paradoxical.  The opposite, I guess, right?  No, they don't!  Yeah, they can.  That's a joke that I was taking.  All right.  All right.  I wish that chimp was here to bite my face off.  Why?  See, I was making kind of a joke.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:52:00]  We've got a busy studio.  K-Rock is moving out of this building today, so we've got basil teas in the house.  Making breakfast for...  Oh, yeah.  Making breakfast for Lisa, really.  Yeah.  That's all for Lisa.  Of course it is.  Who we've worked with for many, many years.  She's moving downtown with everybody else.  Lucky us.  We get to stay here with the corporate guys.  That should be fun.  Yeah, we get along with the corporate so well. 
[01:52:30]  Wow.  That's so great for us.  It'll be fun.  I know.  They're all gorgeous women, and they're all leaving.  That's okay.  Men in suits will be coming in to take their place.  All these women smell really nice.  Yeah.  We don't get to see them much anyway, though.  I'm flinching.  They keep them away from us.  I do notice it's a brand new crew of salespeople, though.  Wow.  We've got a hot-looking crew.  You're the only one that gets to keep a job, huh?  No, we have a few people keeping a job here. 
[01:53:00]  I've never seen these people in my life.  Look at the girls.  Look at the girls.  Kimmy, there's Emily.  They're beautiful.  You're going to miss the back rubs, though.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  They all hide or something.  Why are you all hiding?  They're all afraid of you.  Why?  Because they're afraid.  No, Holly's not afraid of anybody.  We're nice people.  We're nice people.  People like us.  Yeah.  Our customers like us.  We're the genuine article.  I want to thank Stephen for cooking up the omelets and the steak today.  Basil T's, part of the new half-off New York program, NY program, $50 certificates for just $25. 
[01:53:30]  That's great.  Go to 923krock.com for more details.  By the way, Basil T's, the official caterer of the Anthony's House of Debauchery.  So, that is quite, quite the middle of honor you wear there, my friend.  Cruz, he's a good cook if he could, like, cook in the middle of all that craziness that  happens, right?  Lunatics, family.  Making women running by as he's trying to make a sauce for something.  Doesn't matter. 
[01:54:00]  He's concentrating on the food.  Right.  Women running out of the house screaming, but he's making sure everything is tenderized nicely.  Women setting other women's things on fire, and he's using it to cook with.  Right.  He's, uh, he can improvise.  He can improvise.  That's the perfect temperature for the filet mignon, burning brassieres and panties.  All right.  We got a couple things to do before we get out of here.  Sam had a nice little exercise on the street.  We got this cartoon in the paper today that Jimmy noticed. 
[01:54:30]  Jimmy, you want to do that again?  Yeah, it was just, it was in the New York Post, and, um, there, it was, it's, you know,  in referencing, uh, Travis the chimp getting shot, and the cartoon is two cops, one's holding  the pistol with smoke coming off it, the chimp is splayed out with a bleeding back and two  bullets in his stomach, and the other cops, the caption is, they'll have to find someone  else to write the next stimulus bill.  Right.  Now, immediately, your visceral reaction, your gut connection, is that's a slam on Obama, 
[01:55:00]  and everybody knows where that takes you.  They're going to try to take the high road in their minds and go, oh, you're wrong for  going there.  They're going to try to scold the viewer for making the connection that they're somehow  trying to get you to make, because they're going to go, well, we're referencing Congress  or we're referencing something else, but they're not.  No, a slam on Obama, and in this cartoon, the chimp is dead, because it was shot, by  the way.  Yeah. 
[01:55:30]  I mean, it's pretty crazy they would take this chance.  Uh, Sam took the cartoon down in the street, and, uh, what'd you find out there, Sam?  Yeah, without, without the context of the newspaper, we wanted to see how average people would see  it.  Right, right.  And there's three different kinds of response to it.  All are obviously, this is a racial cartoon.  Hmm.  The first is, it's not racist, but the fact that you're, you know what I mean?  Like, the first response is, no, there's nothing racial about that, but they'll say  that before I even said it.  Uh-huh. 
[01:56:00]  They're covering their ass quickly.  Right.  People are so scared.  Let's get right into it.  Sam on the street.  Excuse me, sir.  Do you have any opinion about this comic?  Uh, let me take a peek.  I really don't.  I don't know what to say.  There's no humor in it, and, uh...  What do you think the artist is trying to get for us?  Nothing racial.  Nothing racial?  Nope.  What do you think he meant?  I, I think he was trying to, searching for humor and didn't know what to grab.  Why would you say nothing racial?  Hey, another racial. 
[01:56:30]  Hey, hey, hey.  I don't know.  When Sam didn't say, do you think this is a racial?  Who did you interview?  The artist?  Hey, another racial.  Another racial.  Scandinavians.  That's a little weird.  Yeah, they just immediately...  You didn't preface it by saying, is this a racist?  Yeah.  I know.  They didn't even imply...  What do you think about this?  Yes.  Wow.  Non-racial!  Right.  And then, you got, uh, a woman here.  Excuse me, miss.  Can I ask you a question real quick?  What do you think of this comic? 
[01:57:00]  I don't think anything about that.  Thank you.  I don't think anything about it.  No, you do.  That's what most people did.  They looked at the...  They said, yeah, sure, I'll look at it.  And then they looked down at the comic, and then they say, oh, no, no, no, I don't have  any opinion on that, and walk away.  Isn't this weird?  We live in a weird place right now.  Well, they probably didn't know what he was trying to get out of them.  Like, they probably, like, are we supposed to laugh at this?  Exactly, though, but just be honest.  Yeah.  Give your honest opinion or feeling that you get when you read that, and move along. 
[01:57:30]  There's such a climate of, oh, my God, I can't say anything.  I've got to hide.  There's, like, hidden microphones and, well, not hidden.  I guess you had a real one.  Totally.  But, you know, some kind of government agency camera.  And the cartoon's up on onaradio.com.  You can check it out for yourself.  But we'll probably get in trouble for this.  And O.P. and Anthony put out a comic that was highly offensive.  But it was from the we don't care. 
[01:58:00]  Right.  But they were talking about we don't care.  Yeah, but they went, we don't care, you're fired.  What?  That happened.  Could I ask you real quick what you think of this comic?  Are these two monkeys here?  And this is a cop shooting at?  At the monkey.  Hmm.  What do you think it implies?  I don't know.  And then the wave off.  I don't know.  I don't want to say.  I don't.  Hmm.  I would be like, wow, that is a very racial comic. 
[01:58:30]  That's what I would say.  If you just said, hey, what do you think of this?  I'd say, that's very racial.  I go, it really implies that they are using the chimp to represent the president of the United States with the stimulus package.  That is known to be very offensive to African-Americans, and the bullet holes in them is kind of, you know, I wouldn't be surprised if this artist gets a visit from the Secret Service. 
[01:59:00]  There you go.  Now get out of here, you big frizzy-haired dope.  All right.  Why don't you tell me, though?  I would say that because it's you.  Okay.  But instead he got another one of these.  Can I ask you what you think of this comic?  Not too good.  What do you think it means?  No comment.  Not too good.  No comment?  And this guy, you're like, you're asking about his pedo charges.  I didn't even ask.  He, I was asking somebody else, and the guy stopped on the street and gave me that look as in, well, I'll talk to you.  So I went over.  I was like, okay, what do you think of this? 
[01:59:30]  Then he read, no, no comment.  No comment.  He just wanted to say no comment to someone.  He's always wanted to say that.  So he makes it look like he wants to talk, and he goes, no comment.  Shoves you away.  I finally got to do it.  I finally got to say no comment.  Guess what I did today, honey?  I gave a no comment.  I was no comment guy.  Hey, you found one honest guy.  One honest guy.  You were out there for about 15 or 20 minutes.  You found just one, right?  One.  And here it is.  What do you think of this comic?  What do I think?  Yeah. 
[02:00:00]  It's nasty.  What do you think it implies?  Black person?  Do you think there's racial undertones about Obama?  Huh.  I don't think so.  What black person do you think it represents?  It's just a regular black person in the street, I guess.  Oh, my God.  How stupid are you?  It says stimulus bill.  It says stimulus bill.  So you were right there.  Yeah.  You are kind of leading the witness, Sam.  Yeah.  You are a little bit, but I'd be careful with that.  But he said that first.  But the guy was being like, well, it could be anybody, you know? 
[02:00:30]  I don't think, you know, somebody like in that situation, an Amadou Diallo or something  like that was representing the stimulus bill.  Right.  That guy was just a knee-jerk reactionary idiot to think that because it was cops and that  to me, without the caption, there's not a racial implication.  It's because it's the caption and the word stimulus plan when everyone's associating Obama  with the stimulus plan.  You can't dance around that.  Right.  Well, without the caption, oh, cops, gun, dead monkey.  That could be anything. 
[02:01:00]  It really could be anything.  It could be, you know.  It could be, but it's not going to be interpreted that.  And I will guarantee within the next couple of days you see letters coming in, letters  to the editor and things where they are really complaining about that.  And you might even get an apology from the paper.  Maybe, but there's such, it's amazing.  No one has any respect for, like, your freedom to be expressive in humor.  Right, right.  But when it comes to political stuff, people are really careful about trying to, about 
[02:01:30]  apologizing for it.  But that doesn't come across as very political, to tell you the truth.  It really doesn't.  Let me think.  They'll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill.  I mean, there's really...  When you think stimulus bill, I don't care how they end up doing it.  You think Obama.  Yeah.  You don't think how it's written.  Stimulus bill, Obama.  I guarantee...  That's what we should do.  Go on the street. 
[02:02:00]  Stimulus bill.  Let's see what word they come up.  Yeah, a little word association.  Let's go with word association.  Stimulus bill.  You're back on the street.  Just go word association.  Stimulus bill.  Just say that.  Okay.  People are going to say Congress?  Hell, effing no.  They'll probably say, like, you know, bailout.  Right.  Jobless.  All right.  Let's try it.  Things that you hear...  Oh, my favorite game.  You know, Dick Clark?  You know, before the old you-know-what.  Yeah.  Things cops say. 
[02:02:30]  How are we going to get someone else to write another one after they shot a monkey?  Right.  Sam, go...  I bet that doesn't come up.  Let's do word association.  Let's try that tack.  All right.  We'll end with this today.  Wow.  This side went quick today.  Sure did.  Let's go to Steve in New York.  Steve.  Hello.  Yes.  How you doing?  Yes.  You know, I can't argue with a damn thing you guys are saying.  I agree with everything you say wholeheartedly because the media is a bunch of sanctimonious  and holier-than-thou bunch of assheads that, you know, they're just afraid to put it 
[02:03:00]  on the line.  And when they do put it on the line, in a certain sense, they'll just run for cover  like, oh, well, that's our right to report the news as we see it.  Right.  And I just think it's all BS.  Don't get me wrong.  I absolutely think that that guy has a right to express himself.  He's got a job at this newspaper.  He's got a right to express himself.  But don't try to BS me and tell me that that meant something else. 
[02:03:30]  This cover of safety that the news operates under because of the news, this higher, this  whatever you want to say, this, what do you want to say?  It's a larger umbrella they can operate under without getting in trouble because they're  technically the news.  But maybe that was great in 1975.  Right.  But now they're all ratings-driven or tabloid, grab the scoop.  They're obsessed with branding.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Watermarking every clip.  So they've become every other douchey aspect of television. 
[02:04:00]  So they should get no preferential treatment.  I think Ant saw that firsthand when he was dating Jill.  I mean, you know, not to dig up any sore memories, but, you know, to me, when I hear  some of these guys on the TV, it's like, horse is asses.  I have a number of horses.  Well, sir, there's no need to use that kind of language.  First it was S, and then it was BS, and then it's asses.  What's next, fresh face?  Yeah.  I'm getting a little fresh.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  That was pretty good.  Let's go to Philly. 
[02:04:30]  Greg, how are you?  What do you got on this?  What's going on?  Greg.  He looks at it differently here.  This is Greg.  Go ahead, Greg.  All right.  Anyway, I'm calling about the fact that you guys are basically asking for this man to  get fired.  No, we're not.  No, we're not.  I totally said I think the guy has the right to.  Did you just hear what Anthony said?  He said the complete opposite.  The guy has the right to print it.  To express himself.  But I think he's going to get in trouble for it.  Yeah.  So now what did you...  Okay, go ahead.  Thank you.  Thank you, boy.  Okay.  Anyways, what I'm getting at is the fact that just because you're talking about it and 
[02:05:00]  posting on the internet and just raising these questions out in the streets, people,  getting the media involved in another direction, a.k.a. you guys, it's creating a bigger story.  Too bad.  So then I think I see this guy's point when we F up, it's always the media that jumps on  it and won't let it go and keeps commenting on it and that makes it a bigger snowball and  that's how we get in trouble.  And that's what he's commented on.  I'll agree with you on that.  No, but I'll tell you the difference is this show does not have a history of railroading 
[02:05:30]  and trying to twist things to get people fired, to keep a story going.  The newspapers do.  The newspapers have a history of doing that crap, of twisting everything and harping on  everything and looking to one-up themselves the next day to sell papers.  We don't do that.  We saw something obvious, so we're talking about it.  Right.  But at the end of the day, that still doesn't change the fact that Anthony is an alcoholic.  No, you're right.  Nothing changes that.  End of the day.  End of the day.  You're right.  If that was, instead of a monkey laying there, if that was Anthony's liver, those bullets  would have ricocheted off, damaged. 
[02:06:00]  That's true.  It does.  Frunkus.  All right.  Thanks, sir.  Nice frunkus.  And please, can you say functioning?  Functioning alcoholic.  Anthony's a functioning alcoholic.  When I think alcoholic, I think somebody that, you know, is really screwing up and stuff.  That's right.  But I'm, you know, I'm functioning.  You're no Bowery bum.  Right.  Save it for when I get home.  That's right.  Where I can just stagger around my house and watch people put things in.  Not like that, you know, machinery and things. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, all right.  I don't mean, you know, watch people put things in.  I thought you were turning into a cuckold.  I serviced the ball.  Cuckold.  The word itself is so cuckold.  I'm a cuckold.  It's fun to say.  That last caller was crazy from Philadelphia.  Huh?  Oh.  Yes.  I will be in Philadelphia this Saturday.  At the Tower Theater with Artie Lang.  Tickets, LiveNation.com.  I think there are tickets left. 
[02:07:00]  I'm not sure.  So I'm just plug whoring.  This Saturday night.  Very funny show.  Let's hope so.  Yes.  Big laughs to be had.  Big laughs.  And if not, well, no money back.  Then go screw you.  Exactly.  Hit a pole on the way home.  Don't tell a friend.  Exactly.  Like you didn't laugh.  Call someone on your cell phone on the way home as you're complaining.  And rear end a dump truck.  Lose your face like monkey lady.  For all I give a hoot.  Excuse my language.  I think we end with this.  A little fun. 
[02:07:30]  Well, Peanuts are now on Northwest Airlines snack menu.  And travelers with allergies are flooding the carrier with complaints about the change.  Northwest began serving peanuts this month as its merger partner, Atlanta-based Delta Airlines, has done for years.  Georgia is the top peanut-producing state in the country.  Delta says that it will make seating and service accommodations for peanut-allergic passengers.  Ah, boy.  She certainly can't get that out of her head. 
[02:08:00]  Yes, how about this?  Just don't eat them.  They see you, especially if you have a peanut allergy?  How about when they try to hand it to you, you go, no.  Oh, thank you.  I can't eat that.  Some people are so allergic to peanuts, mind you, that just the dust in the ventilation system of an airplane will set off.  Oh, really?  So they say.  I've never heard of it happening.  That's great.  I've seen it.  Imagine peanuts has been given out.  Oh, you can't dole out penises, peanutses.  Exactly.  Be a bunch of white and Asian ones laying around, all the black ones get taken immediately. 
[02:08:30]  Boy, she really screwed that up.  Oh, oh, here we go.  All right, well.  Nice.  Come on, I want to hear this.  I like that Danny's not committing to this.  When he hands it to you and his shoulders go up like, hey, it's something.  I only had an hour.  Wait, you know what it was?  I started all gung-ho about it, and then I saw time was running out, and I wanted to get it on the air before the end of the show.  Oh, there you go. 
[02:09:00]  So it's going to trickle up to the finish line.  Are the wheels going to just fall off?  Kind of.  It starts making sense, and then it just kind of ends like a horror movie.  You know what?  Now it's got to be played.  We were asking for Christian Bale, 911, Chimp Audio, remixes.  Yep, just the thought I hadn't.  And Danny decided to give it a shot.  Maybe we'll get.  I don't even know.  It might be good.  Let's take a listen to it.  Put the police up!  No!  With a gun!  With a gun!  No!  Don't shut me up! 
[02:09:30]  Are you professional or not?  Yes.  Listen to me!  Please hurry up!  The chimp killed my friend!  Well, somebody should be f***ing watching and keeping an eye on him.  What is he doing there?  He ripped her face off!  Oh, good!  And how was it?  She's dead.  You don't f***ing understand what it's like working with actors.  That's what that is.  He said he ripped her part.  That's what that is, man.  I'm telling you.  Think for one f***ing second. 
[02:10:00]  Please hurry.  Please.  Please hurry.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to f***ing kick your f***ing ass.  You don't shut up for a second, all right?  They got him.  Shoot him.  Please.  He ripped her part.  Let's get Tom and put this back on.  Let's go again.  Can I have Tom put this on, please?  No, I can't.  He's dead.  He's not dead.  He's not dead.  He's not dead.  Oh, God.  Oh, God. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  Nice ending.  Well, yeah, I figured it should just end like a zombie movie.  A zombie movie.  That ends like Night of the Living Dead.  He makes it through the whole thing and then just gets shot at the end of the movie.  She's the scaredest person ever.  Yeah.  I've never heard of a scareder breathing.  I bet that car stunk if she was letting all of how frightened she was out of herself like Jimmy does.  Yes.  Yes, when the courage pushes fear.  Uh-oh. 
[02:11:00]  Steve just walked in and walked out.  What happened?  No, no, no.  Steve just walked in and walked out.  No, right.  He looks sad.  Danny, not bad, man.  I like that.  Yeah, I don't know, man.  I'm sure somebody out there could do much better.  That was very funny.  It started, like I said, all good.  With the best of intentions that it was a rush job to make it on the air before 9 o'clock.  And that's how we end today.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. 
[02:11:30]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. 
[02:12:00]  Bye.  Thank you. 
[02:12:30]  Thank you. 
[02:13:00]  Thank you. 
[02:13:30]  Thank you. 
[02:14:00]  Thank you. 
[02:14:30]  Thank you. 
[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Welcome to the O&A show on Liberty Sirius XM DirecTV Satellite Radio.  There's a lot of slashes in those names.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Seems Liberty, what, came to the table?  Yep.  Fended off a little bankruptcy?  For now.  We'll see what happens.  I'm looking at a Facebook and...  I'm looking at a Facebook and...  No, no, we don't want to say what it is because we don't want to say what it is.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Where are we going with this? 
[02:16:00]  We just have a script.  Let's just say we want a couple of people to read.  Oh, okay.  I got you.  Yeah.  Oh, does that hear you?  Hold on.  What?  You can say what it is.  He's walking over from CBS now.  Okay.  We have...  Apparently, we have young David's Facebook.  Yeah.  David has a...  Executive intern, David.  Yes.  Sam, you want to explain?  Yeah, well, you're the resident vulture.  David?  Hurry up before he gets here.  David's been talking to people a lot on Facebook, and when you click wall-to-wall, you can see  what each wall...  You know, what they're saying to each other, the messages that they're leaving on their 
[02:16:30]  walls.  Yeah, of course.  So David has struck up a romance with a certain...  Oh, really?  I'll say young lady.  I don't know why I would say young, but a certain lady on Facebook.  Really?  So...  And he's got a three-page deep wall-to-wall conversation.  And it goes from the innocence of meeting into pretty much pure love in less than three  pages.  He is a dork. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, he's...  What a fucking nerd.  Do we want to give away more?  No, we should have him read the script.  And I think we should have...  We should get a girl to play the girl's part.  If we can't find a girl, I mean, we don't have an executive producer for nothing.  That's true.  You should always ask her to do it.  And we have a big show today.  We have Greg Gutfield coming in at 10, because I'm doing red-eyed tonight.  And we have a Robin Leach phoner, which...  So hard to get that.  That's in a couple minutes.  Yeah, it's at 9.30.  Don't fret.  I don't think it's going to be very long. 
[02:17:30]  I don't know.  What's he promoting?  What's Art of the L promoting?  I'm very excited to talk to Robin Leach today.  Yeah, me too.  Are you?  I'm going to set a new world record today.  Yeah, we could.  What's my record?  Four seconds?  I think so.  All right.  We'll go for three.  Let's go for two.  Where's David?  So we're just waiting on David to start this up.  Yeah, he was left to help Basil Tees clean up, but...  Oh, he was?  He's going to be a while.  No, he's going to get him over here now.  Yeah, I traded him out with somebody else.  Why was he?  Oh, you're dead?  Yes. 
[02:18:00]  Wouldn't that be the job of the executive intern to delegate that responsibility?  Well, the executive intern is technically that girl, and she's not here today.  So, where's the bitch?  She was here yesterday.  Executiving.  She's very cute or something.  All right, we'll do a Oscar moment featuring David, because we're going into some David material  here.  So, check this out.  Hopefully, we'll have intern David in studio in a matter of minutes.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents Oscar Moments.  Memorable scenes from Academy Award-nominated films. 
[02:18:30]  Nominated for eight Academy Awards, including performance by an actor in a leading role, performance  by an actor in a supporting role, and best picture, Milk.  My name is Harvey Milk, and I want to recruit you.  Yay!  I am here tonight to say we will no longer sit quietly in our closets.  We must fight, not just in the Castro or San Francisco, but everywhere the Anitas go. 
[02:19:00]  Anita Bryant did not win tonight.  Anita Bryant has brought us together.  She is going to create a national gay force.  Stay tuned for more Oscar Moments, presented by the Opie and Anthony Show.  Wow, I felt like I was watching the movie.  There you go.  I forgot to mention.  Schindler's List.  Yeah, Sam's back. 
[02:19:30]  Yes, Sam.  I forgot to mention, Steve's also very, very pissed at David today, because David showed  up at 7.45 this morning.  Wow.  And refuses to tell Steve why.  Oh, my God.  Steve is here.  Steve is perfect.  He refuses to tell Steve why he's just showing up whenever the fuck he wants.  He just kept saying, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, I won't do it again.  I'm sorry.  And Steve said, why?  And he said, I'm sorry.  It won't happen again.  I'm sorry.  It won't happen again.  I think at one point I said, I don't give a shit why you're sorry.  How about you?  Or I don't give a shit that you're sorry. 
[02:20:00]  Just tell me why.  Oh, wow.  And then he began to stammer.  Oh, that ow.  Oh, you tripped over.  Oh, that's got to hurt.  You were carrying a fucking, you felt like, it sounded like Henry Fonda when he dropped  the dishes outside of.  Balloons.  But yes, he said he was going to be late, and 6.30 was apparently when he said he was  going to come in.  He waltzed in at 7.45.  I would love to talk to him.  Where is he now?  Apparently on his way up with, we've got Eric watching the door for him. 
[02:20:30]  All right.  You should have said, drop everything and get over to 7 immediately.  That was exactly the thing.  I did.  In fact, I screamed, don't dawdle.  Right.  Into the film.  Don't dawdle.  He dawdles all the time.  You got an update on him, sir, David.  He's here.  Oh, he's here.  He's here.  Is he a dawdler?  Yes, he's such a dawdler.  David?  David.  He's dawdling.  All right.  Stop dawdling.  Where's my David?  David.  David.  Come on in.  Oh, my God.  David, were you dawdling?  No.  I didn't think so.  It took you so long, God damn it. 
[02:21:00]  David.  David.  David.  Yeah.  Yeah, see, he's got to get settled in.  There he is.  Hi, David.  Hello.  David, why were you late this morning?  And why would you tell Steve why you were late this morning?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  You can't just show up and not tell people why you were late.  You need what's called an excuse.  Right.  That way we can judge if it's legitimate,  because we can tell when people are lying, 
[02:21:30]  a legitimate good excuse or just a dumb excuse,  and it kind of reflects on your performance.  Because if you're just like, you know,  well, I just was lazy and I was sleeping,  that doesn't sound good.  No.  If it was a problem, mechanical problem, train problem,  something like that, that's a better excuse.  Right.  Although do not use these examples.  We'll know if you're lying.  Right.  Tell us the truth.  Why did you come in so extremely late this morning?  Well, first of all, I didn't have a ride here, 
[02:22:00]  so I was going to be late anyways.  Well, we heard you were going to be at 6.30,  and then you came, as Steve said,  waltzing in here at 7.35, was it?  45.  45.  Uh-oh.  7.45.  Now, 6.30 and 7.45, big difference.  Power 15 minutes, Ant.  Big difference.  Thank you, Jim.  So, what do you attribute that to, sir?  I just attribute that to me being lazy, me sleeping. 
[02:22:30]  He told me he got on the...  So that was the bad one.  He said he...  You said you got on the 5.45 train  and you were up at 5 in the morning.  Uh-oh.  What happened, David?  David?  I was up at 5 in the morning.  I was.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  You could talk to us.  What happened?  Eh, it's just me being...  sleeping and being lazy.  You were up at 5.  You just said that.  Wait, if you were up at 5...  Well, we have a...  Oof. 
[02:23:00]  We don't want to...  Oh, right.  David, can you put you on hold, David?  We have a...  Dave, hold on, please.  This may be a while.  We have a celebrity guest calling in.  We have Robin Leach calling in,  and we can't make him...  Yes.  Remember Robin Leach?  He's famous for Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.  Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.  From the 80s and I guess maybe the early 90s,  and I guess he's working on something new these days.  Yes, Robin.  Robin Leach.  We're excited to talk to Robin Leach.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  How are you?  Gentlemen, a very good morning to you. 
[02:23:30]  Very good morning indeed, sir.  Before we get into what you're working on,  I need to know,  what was the most expensive house you ever were in?  Uh, you know it pales by today's rates.  The most expensive house we were in was, uh...  All right.  Back to David.  Robin Leach, everybody.  The great Robin Leach.  Robin Leach.  Still going strong after all these years.  Yes.  God bless him.  Probably one of the best interviews with Robin I've ever heard. 
[02:24:00]  We learned a lot today.  Yes.  Good to know he's still doing it.  God bless his soul.  David, back to you.  All right.  David, why were you late?  All right.  You were up at five.  Steve wants to...  Steve, what are you doing?  We have to...  You have to...  I'm scrolling and scrolling.  It's going to ring?  Yes.  That's what's going to ring in two minutes.  Oh, he's muting his thing.  It's M for M.  M for M.  Exactly.  He's good.  He's an incredible list.  M for M hung.  M for M.  Uncut. 
[02:24:30]  W M for B M.  Black man.  Oh, what's W M?  White man.  Oh, okay.  So, um...  Jesus.  Wow.  Wow.  T.M.  Thirsty Mouse.  Fuck.  Thirsty Mouse.  Ah.  Well, David.  Yes.  You were up at five.  Yeah.  Then how did you... 
[02:25:00]  You're lazy and sleepy, but you're up at five, but you didn't get in here until 745.  Explain what you did from the time you regained consciousness this morning until you waltzed  through the door.  Pretty much just, like, took a shower, got ready to come here, and then walked all the  way to the train, and then came here, and got on the subway, and then came here.  But don't you do that every day, and you get here on time?  No.  No, I don't do that every day, no. 
[02:25:30]  He's got a parent that drives him usually, right?  Yeah, I don't usually go on the train here, yeah.  But that still doesn't take three hours.  No, three hours, no.  No.  What happened?  What happened?  David?  Oh, yeah.  David?  I just told you, there's really nothing that happened.  It's my fault, and I am very sorry.  I apologize.  Why did you oversleep, though?  It's a three-hour train ride.  It's not three hours.  I know it isn't.  You have lost time.  A UFO grabbed you.  Yeah.  You're experiencing what's called lost time. 
[02:26:00]  Yes.  What happened in that time between 5 until 7.45?  That is not just a subway ride and a train ride.  I know.  So what was it?  What happened?  Maybe I didn't wake up at 5 exactly.  I don't know.  Oh, David.  So it wasn't 5 exactly.  We've all fibbed in the morning when we call work, right?  We've all told you we've all done that.  Yes, yes.  So what time did you actually really, no bullshit, wake up? 
[02:26:30]  I really don't know what time I woke up.  You don't know?  How about a guess?  Ballpark.  Sometime in the 5 o'clock hour.  Well, that's a big difference.  It's 5 or 5.59.  Yeah.  It wasn't 5.59.  No?  No.  Well, you told Sam you're on the 5.45 train, correct?  Is that what I said?  Yes, it is what you said.  David, what's going on with you?  Come on.  Are you high?  Don't make us fish it out of you.  Tell us what's going on.  No, I'm not high.  What happened?  You stayed up late last night?  Yeah.  Your parents schooled you?  What happened?  There's a story here.  Yeah, come on. 
[02:27:00]  No, my parents didn't do anything, no.  Well, not your parents, but were you drinking?  No, I wasn't.  I know you like to drink.  He has been up late because his parents are out of town, and I've noticed him on Facebook  at 4.15 a.m.  while he's not at work.  All right, David, David, David.  I'm starting to now, the puzzle pieces are coming together because I got this and this  and this, and there's a few items of information here.  Are you up at four in the morning, in the four o'clock hour, on Facebook? 
[02:27:30]  The one on Monday, I think it was Monday.  I was.  Monday.  You weren't last night.  How late were you on Facebook last night?  No, I wasn't last night.  No, Monday.  At all?  I was.  You didn't go on Facebook at all last night?  Last night I went on.  All right.  And what time was that?  Probably like around 11.  Around 11.  You were about to say two.  You know, these are all checkable, by the way. 
[02:28:00]  I know.  Facebook is a very public, open forum.  All the posts are time-coded and everything.  That's true.  You can pretty much tell when somebody's still awake.  Just look at mine.  You see all fucking kinds of hours.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  So, was it 11?  Yes.  Or was it more like two in the morning?  No, it wasn't two.  It wasn't two?  No.  Could it have been one?  No.  Could it have been one in the morning?  No.  12.30, midnight.  No.  Oh, my God.  This is exhausting. 
[02:28:30]  David, give us some more info.  There's no info.  Your parents went out of town.  It's obvious they don't go out of town often, so all hell broke loose at the house, right?  No.  Getting into some shenanigans?  No.  What are you doing?  Just sliding around in your underpants like Tom Cruise in risky business?  Break the crystal egg?  Did he get laid?  Joey's pants take all the furniture out of the house?  You get a hooker?  Enough about the movie.  No, I didn't get a hooker.  No.  You didn't get a hooker?  What did you get?  No.  What happened?  I didn't.  You jerking off in the living room?  Just because you can? 
[02:29:00]  That's right.  He goes, yeah.  Did you jerk off in the living room last night?  No, no.  Did you angrily masturbate into mother's shoes?  Mother.  That's even worse when you say mother's shoes?  Yes.  Mother will pay.  Those shoes that have cowed you your whole life?  Did you suddenly show them who was the boss?  No.  Are you going to offer up anything?  Or is this going to go round and round?  There's really nothing to say.  There's something there, though. 
[02:29:30]  You're never late.  I made a mistake.  Where'd your parents go?  That place Dirty Dancing was filmed?  No?  Catskills?  All those things?  Two more copies of the script, by the way?  Two more copies?  Okay.  I got it figured out.  The parents barely go away.  They take care of David.  They make sure he gets here.  Without his parents, he doesn't know what the fuck to do.  He's useless.  He doesn't know what to do.  He gets very confused.  He dawdles.  Are you a dawdler, David?  Yes.  You do dawdles?  Yes.  What do you do when you're dawdling?  What does dawdling consist of for you? 
[02:30:00]  I don't know.  It depends on what I'm doing.  If it's early in the morning, and I'm supposed to be getting ready to go somewhere, dawdling  usually consists of trying to sleep longer.  So you're squeaking out an extra few minutes of sleep?  Well, it's more like 10 or 15 for me.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, boy.  Do you daydream a lot?  I'd say...  You have a little imagination, fantasies that go through your head, and you get preoccupied  with those? 
[02:30:30]  I'm always daydreaming.  Always.  What do you daydream about?  Give me an example.  Anything.  Give me an example.  It's not anything.  I used to daydream that aliens came down and gave me tools to fend off other aliens that  were trying to destroy Earth, and me and my friends would fly in spaceships and destroy  them.  Okay.  There.  It's out.  Okay.  Now, what do you...  What did you...  Oof.  I was working a stapler at a sheet metal shop, okay?  I needed something I could find.  I don't care what you were doing. 
[02:31:00]  That's inexcusable.  It was great.  Okay.  I'll get to that.  What do you daydream, David?  It's great.  Yeah.  What do you daydream about?  I don't daydream about anything specifically.  That you're the president?  Yes.  Have you?  No.  Of a bank.  No.  I just...  I'm just...  I'm not...  Give us one little daydream, because a lot of people, they daydream.  It's very detailed, and...  I don't have anything detailed.  I'm just daydreaming about, like, life and stuff, and what's going on in my life.  Life.  What's going on in your life? 
[02:31:30]  So, what do you say?  I'm just, like, daydreaming about, like, what I'm doing, or stuff like, I'm looking for a job,  or, like, what's going on at home and stuff, and...  So, you mean, that's not really daydreaming.  I know, it's not daydreaming.  That's kind of thinking about your life.  I know, it's not.  If you daydream, it's like these fantasy little world that you put yourself in.  You don't have any aspirations to do anything, so you kind of imagine yourself in that situation?  No, I don't really do that, no.  You don't do that?  No.  Kenny just told me that when he goes on food runs with David, David takes forever,  because in every single food store in the area, he's got a girl that he likes, 
[02:32:00]  and he just stands in the place and stares at her.  Holy shit, is that true, David?  That's true, yes.  All right, there's nothing wrong with that.  So, yeah, staring at girls like a creep, that's fine.  That's true, yeah, I can't, yeah.  Oh, my God, someone called 911 about the, it seems to be another incident like happened yesterday.  Oh, wait, no, that's different footage.  Okay, sorry.  All right, ha, ha, ha, ha, yes. 
[02:32:30]  Apparently, Travis has friends.  Yeah.  So, okay, go ahead.  So, you stare at these girls.  Yes, correct.  Ah, that's what happens.  Do you ever talk to them?  Yeah, sometimes, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What do you think of when you're staring at them?  Like, what it would be like to be their boyfriend and to be, like, an interesting guy that they like?  Yeah.  What do you say to them in your fantasies?  Come on, I don't mean the sexual ones.  I don't say, I'm not really, like, I'm just pretty much just, like, standing there in this looking at them.  You don't talk?  I do talk to them, yeah. 
[02:33:00]  You know, you do walk up to the girl at the pizza place and ask her what she does with all the lost jackets that she finds.  Okay.  I'll try that one.  Oh.  Okay.  Hey, Rhett, would you get that out of the hamper?  Okay, I'll try that one.  That's true.  Yeah, try that one.  That works well.  It worked good for Rhett with Stacey.  Okay.  Yeah.  David.  Yes.  No fantasies, no daydreams.  You look at girls in stores, that takes you forever.  Okay, we've got a little background here. 
[02:33:30]  But how does that take time, though?  It's just pretty much just when we're waiting, like, the order has been, when I'm with Kenny on it.  Well, let's ask Kenny.  Just creepily gawking at girls without saying anything?  Well, the order.  Oh, they must be so ghouled out by that.  It doesn't take time, though, because the order is in place.  All right, let's ask Kenny.  Kenny's there with you.  Kenny's a cop.  Shut up, David.  He knows exactly what you're doing.  Kenny will explain.  Go ahead, Kenny.  All right.  I try to coax David to break the ice and talk to the girls and make a move, yeah.  Him nothing, right?  He's got no game, no pimp hands.  You've taken a liking to David, haven't you? 
[02:34:00]  I hear you buy him breakfast and you try to do the right thing by him.  Yeah.  David's good people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he just sits there and stares at the...  Yeah, he's got no game at all.  It's like a lawn jockey in a yellow jacket.  Do the women get awkward?  Do they get awkward?  Tell them about the women, like the one across the street.  Which one?  Christina.  Do you know the names?  She's got the names?  Wow.  Kenny must ask.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  What about her? 
[02:34:30]  She's a nice woman.  She's a very beautiful woman.  Yeah, right.  How do you know her name?  How do we know her name?  I've been told what her name is.  By her?  Yes.  Did you ask?  Yes, I've asked.  Yes.  Okay.  And now, what does she look like?  I can't recall.  How do you not recall?  What does she look like?  Does she have a cock and a beard?  No.  You can't answer it.  Start there and go backwards.  You can't answer anything.  No.  What do you like about her, David?  I just like the way she looks. 
[02:35:00]  But you don't know how she looks.  What does she look like?  I can't recall.  What does a bitch look like?  What do you mean he can't recall?  Kenny, wouldn't he just be a nightmare of a witness?  Like, he sees a crime and you're trying to interrogate him and he just...  Well, the phone book would be worn out by now.  He'd just be beating him all over the...  You like what she looks like, but you don't know what she looks like.  But what color hair?  Oh, my God.  I think it's like brownish, I think.  I think it's like brownish.  David, picture her in your mind's eye. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  I'm trying to.  Yes.  You're staying there.  She's working.  You're contemplating decapitating her.  You have a tent in your pants.  I think she's got like long brown hair down to her shoulders and she's kind of taller than most.  Does she look like maybe a celebrity in any way?  Like that kind of a...  I guess like a figure.  She doesn't look like one particular celebrity.  How about a couple combined?  Yeah, give us a celebrity that pops in your head when you think of her. 
[02:36:00]  That's a tough one.  She just has like a certain quality.  Ernest Borgnine?  Yes.  She doesn't look like a celebrity, really.  She just looks like...  Mini Pearl?  I don't know who that is.  Does she have a hat with a price tag on it and she yells howdy while you jerk off in her face?  Some savage knocks it off?  She does.  David, how about your little china doll at the other deli?  Ah, so you got a little Asian girl that perhaps...  Okay.  What does she look like?  What's her name?  Yeah, what does she look like?  Straight black hair.  Yes, actually.  No ass. 
[02:36:30]  Yes, actually.  Yeah, no kidding.  Yeah, yeah.  Figure that out.  Windshield glass in her face from another driving accident.  What does she look like, David?  She does actually look like that.  She's a...  Celebrity that she...  Lucy Liu.  Not at all, no.  No?  No, she's not nearly as...  She's not really like...  Chelyung Fat.  No.  She's...  Jackie Chan.  She's extremely, like, super, super tall.  Like, maybe she's almost close to six feet.  Jesus.  For a woman, she's pretty tall.  Oh my gosh, she looks like Yao.  Yeah, she does kind of look like... 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, she does a little bit, yeah.  Oh, Christ.  All right, so you like this fucking...  This monolith Asian girl.  Yes, correct.  What do you like about her?  She has big, fat fucking tits?  She does, actually, yes.  You want to suck them?  I would like to.  She does, actually.  I would like to.  Good tits, plenty of them.  So does she have...  How does she dress?  Well, she has a lot of different dresses.  A lot of different, like, outfits. 
[02:37:30]  She doesn't have one particular dress.  You just, like, often she's just, like, normally dressed like a regular woman's blouse and her  regular jeans and stuff and plain, like, looking.  There was one time when she, like, put on, like, all this, like, super-duper amounts of,  like, makeup and stuff.  I'm like, totally, like...  Super-duper amounts.  Tempt herself out.  I'm like, all of a sudden, I didn't even recognize her one time.  Did she look good or like a whore who kind of needed to be hit with a bicycle chain?  She did look like that that one day.  She did, that one day.  Did you like the whorey look?  I like both of the looks, actually.  They're all pretty good in different...  Yeah. 
[02:38:00]  In different ways, right.  Yeah.  One's the bring it home to mom and dad, and the other one's just, like, pound it right  there in the store.  Yes, correct.  Yeah.  Although, what would your parents say if you brought home an Asian girl?  Because I know they want you with a Jewish girl.  They wouldn't approve of that at all.  No, at all, right?  No, they wouldn't, no.  What about a Negro girl?  They wouldn't approve of that either.  They wouldn't approve of that?  No.  Why?  That seems racist.  Your parents are racist, you're saying.  No, I'm not saying that at all.  No, no.  But they wouldn't be happy if you brought home a black girl. 
[02:38:30]  No, they wouldn't be happy.  So they're racist.  No, they certainly aren't racist, no.  So, living with these two bigots, has it really...  Whoa!  Would they be bad if you were homosexual and you brought home a Sammy Davis?  Yes.  Yes, they would.  He's black, he's Jewish.  Because he's black.  And he's dead.  He's not Jewish.  Sammy Davis Jr. was Jewish before he's dead.  Yeah.  You got a black Jew.  He converted their, uh, David.  It happens.  David.  I guess if he was Jewish, then I was almost...  Then they wouldn't care, no.  All right.  So your parents just want you dating Jewish girls, right? 
[02:39:00]  You could see how a girl could fall for a guy like that.  Yes, that's correct, yes.  They just want me dating, yes.  Oh, David, you are a fucking specimen, man.  I want to see David do a, uh...  Yeah, that's what we're getting at.  Okay.  Yes, yes.  So how are we doing this?  Because, uh...  Sam?  We have a script we want David and somebody else to read.  Yes.  What is it a script of?  We do need, uh...  We do need a young lady, I think.  Either Steve or a girl.  Um...  Well...  Yeah.  Oh, really? 
[02:39:30]  Tomato, tomato.  All right.  Please come in here.  Yes.  Yes.  Who is this bitch?  Yes.  She, uh...  What happened?  Oh, you were overridden.  Which one were you taking?  Let's just have them duke it out like two chimps.  How are you doing?  That would be great.  Whoever comes in with a face wins.  How are you?  Oh, sorry.  You were shut out there.  Oh, well.  You're going to have to have your claim to fame strictly on Pal Talk.  Okay.  Uh...  Take a seat there and, uh... 
[02:40:00]  Hi.  Oh, we're good on that fucking mic.  Whatever Danny tells you to do.  What's your name?  Or sit down.  Hi, Stacy.  Say, Stacy.  Isn't this great?  It was great.  So we're doing a little play acting.  We got Stacy and David reading a script here.  Yes.  Did he give David the script?  No.  All right.  Why did Stacy of hers?  All right.  Stacy's script.  Stacy gets a script.  And, uh...  Stacy gets a script.  That's right.  Don't make a fucking...  And David will be playing the part of David Freed. 
[02:40:30]  Oh.  Now, you have to read from the bottom to the top.  How is he playing the part of David Freed?  He is David Freed.  What are you getting at?  I don't understand.  Why are we reading this?  Oh, wait a minute.  What happened?  What, David?  Is there a problem?  David, what's the problem?  What are you looking at?  What's the matter, David?  Why do we got to read all this?  That's harmless.  Because it's a script.  It's a kind of a...  Almost like a love story.  Yeah.  It's a...  It's the story of a budding romance 
[02:41:00]  between a young Jewish man...  I don't think...  And an older Gentile,  apparently Dago woman...  From Boston.  From Boston.  Yeah.  And how they kind of meet  and work up a relationship  that enters love very, very quickly.  A stormy romance ensues.  Yes.  Indeed. 
[02:41:30]  And it's based on fact.  I think it's based on a true story.  You'll be playing the part of David Freed.  Oh, I'm going to play myself, huh?  Oh, yeah.  And you, Miss, will be playing the part of Mary Ann.  Who's not available right now to do her part.  Yes.  She's up in Boston.  Where is the bitch?  How do you know?  She's up in Boston with her husband.  How do you know?  With her husband?  According to her profile, she's married.  What are you doing?  Reading the script? 
[02:42:00]  I know.  I know what it is.  How do you know?  You read the script?  Very sultry.  I know because I read her profile  and it says she's married.  It says, I am happily married to my soulmate.  I have a wonderful husband and two, boy, this font could not be small.  Awesome kids.  Wonderful husband, awesome kids.  Excellent person to pass on.  They seem vulnerable.  Doesn't get any better than this, it says. 
[02:42:30]  Right.  I thought you only get one soulmate.  And then there are 20 hearts or something.  There are stars next to it or something.  Yeah, well, apparently, this gentleman, David, David Freed,  has sparked up a little Facebook romance.  Let's start.  And someone took the liberty of downloading all of the conversation.  You've got to love wall to wall.  Now, David.  Yes.  Did you know that this was all public record? 
[02:43:00]  Yes, I knew.  You did know.  Yes, I know, yes.  Yet, you put yourself out there.  You wore your heart on your sleeve and your brain in your ass.  She started messaging me and giving me all these Facebook gift type things,  and I went along with it.  I played along and went along with it.  Oh, played along.  Okay.  Yes.  I just want to make that clear.  She initiated it.  Of course you did.  Hey, that's how every rape defense starts.  Don't even worry about it.  All right, let's get into this.  Come on.  Where do I start from?  From the very beginning and the bottom. 
[02:43:30]  First page.  Each page, you go bottom to the top.  Right.  Bottom?  Bottom to the top.  Show him, Sam.  He still doesn't understand.  Start there.  No.  I don't think we start on this page, because if I'm saying that, then we have to...  That's the last recorded wall.  So that's from the 13th of...  Before that, you don't have that.  Right.  You can maybe set it up a little without going into the conversation.  What happened before this scene?  Before this scene, she just started contacting me and said that she liked the bits that I 
[02:44:00]  have on this show and that she was excited that I used to be an executive intern.  She was excited about that.  Excited.  So you then saw this and thought you would start pursuing this a little bit.  Yes, that's correct.  Pursuing this.  And at first, what did you think of this?  Just friendship?  I thought it was just like a little silly thing on Facebook, and I didn't think much of it.  Uh-huh.  But as we will all see as we go on with this script, you'll see that what? 
[02:44:30]  What do we got to do?  Interrupt Anthony?  No, no, no.  Because you're doing a fine job.  That's all about you, David.  You're doing a fine job of doing that.  Hey, David, you're talking.  David will talk when he wants to talk.  Yeah, just talk over me.  Okay, we have to say that she proceeded to get anything.  That's amazing.  Oh, my God.  You're fantastic, David.  Let's just start.  Let's get it.  We have to set it up that she...  Oh.  Hey, Opie.  Opie, in other words, go fuck yourself. 
[02:45:00]  I'm sorry, David.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  This is what I'm coming to.  I'll just sit here and eat my yogurt, David.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  She continues to...  Still not getting anything.  Go ahead, David.  You're doing good.  She proceeded to send me a Facebook gift for Valentine's Day.  Oh, boy.  That means a lot, by the way.  Yep.  Because those are hard to come by.  That's right.  But when you send it on Facebook, you see that you have a gift, but it won't show you 
[02:45:30]  what the gift is until the actual day of Valentine's Day.  What was the gift?  Oh, you had to wait.  I had to wait.  It was like the day before.  Don't say it.  Don't say it.  It's in here.  Let's just start reading, David.  Let's not get ahead of ourselves.  No.  The love of peace.  And this is where it starts.  All right.  Where you have it.  Yes, of course.  Go ahead.  Okay.  You've got your part there, Stacey.  I think so.  You know that you're Marianne.  Marianne.  And let's read this with a little bit of the emotion that is due for these lines.  Don't just read this like you're reading a fucking textbook. 
[02:46:00]  Okay.  You wrote these lines with some emotion, David.  I want you to read them with the same emotion with which they were written.  And Stacey, I'm sure you're a fantastic actor.  Shut the fuck up.  Oh, I didn't know what the gift was at this point.  I don't care about the fucking gift.  Enough about the gift.  Yes.  I care about you emoting these lines.  All right.  In the proper fashion.  And, you know, Stacey, do your best.  Try to be this Marianne girl.  All right.  We start at 6.34 p.m. 
[02:46:30]  It's February 13th, 2009.  The day before Valentine's Day.  As David types on his computer, he says this.  Thank you so much for the gift.  That is very kind of you.  You're a sweetheart.  You're very welcome, David.  I think you're adorable.  I love hearing you on the show.  Keep up the good work.  I wonder what you got me. 
[02:47:00]  It won't let me see the gift until midnight when it's officially Valentine's Day.  That's so nice of you to do.  Thanks.  The suspense is killing you, eh?  I guess you'll just have to wait and see.  Yes.  It is.  Bottom of the topic.  You are too funny, David.  I'm not trying to be funny.  I really do want to know what you got me.  It's just such a nice thing for you to do.  You don't even know me and you got me a present.  Wow. 
[02:47:30]  Well, I think you're a really nice guy, David, and you deserve it.  Thank you for the kind words.  I wonder what it is that I deserve.  Just a little something to let you know that I was thinking about you on Valentine's Day.  I'm blushing.  I'll be thinking about you, too.  Aw, now I am, too.  Thanks for making me smile.  You're welcome.  Oh, no. 
[02:48:00]  And it's you again.  Oh, it's me again.  Marianne, my darling.  How does this gift thing work?  I am new to Facebook and don't know.  You need to have gift credits to get a gift?  How does one go about getting credits?  I would like to get you a gift on here.  David, your attention is gift enough for me.  That is the most wonderful gift in my eyes.  Aw.  Thanks.  You're a sweetheart.  Thank you so much. 
[02:48:30]  That's really nice of you.  You're such a sweetheart.  You're welcome, David.  I hope you have a wonderful day.  Have you gotten the gift at this point, David?  Yes.  It is now 10.36 a.m. on February 15th, Valentine's Day.  No.  What was the gift?  The gift was like...  I've already got it.  The gift was like this little thing on Facebook.  It's like a heart.  It says like love or it has like a lot...  It says like I love you or something on like a heart or something like that. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, that's cool.  That's very thoughtful.  Yeah, it's a Facebook thing.  Very thoughtful.  Oh, I see.  A couple of your time differences there.  No biggie.  Let it roll.  Now it's the 15th.  The day after comes.  Yes.  Yes.  Good morning, David.  Good morning to you, sweetheart.  How's my favorite executive intern doing today?  Good.  Thinking of you.  Aw, that's so sweet.  Hope you had a good day today.  I thought about you all day.  You should come to the show one time.  Kiss, kiss. 
[02:49:30]  All right.  Oh, they learn quick, don't they?  How very kind of you, David.  I had a great day.  Glad to be home from work now.  If I'm ever in the area, I'll definitely stop by and see you.  That Care Bear was so nice of you to send me.  I feel so honored to get all these gifts from you.  Thank you so much.  Lots of love to you, sweetheart.  Lots of love. 
[02:50:00]  You're welcome, sweetie.  I hope you're enjoying your day off.  XOXO.  Yes, I'm enjoying it.  Thank you.  I'll be thinking of you.  Kiss, kiss.  David, you truly are a sweetheart.  I'm glad to hear you're enjoying it.  You work so hard and deserve it.  Will you be on the radio tomorrow?  Unfortunately, no.  I don't go there on Tuesdays.  I only go there on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  Well, then, I look forward to seeing you on Wednesday. 
[02:50:30]  Hearing.  Hearing.  Yes.  Wow.  That's great.  Boy, you fell head over heels by page two.  Kiss, kiss.  Kiss, kiss.  Love.  Trying to bring it to the next level, huh, David?  Yeah.  What were you trying there now?  Come on, tell us.  I don't know.  I was just playing along with it.  Playing along with it?  Yes, you're cocked.  That's what you're playing with.  She started messaging me, so I went along with it, and she started giving me all these gifts.  I started going along.  Okay, thank you for these gifts.  That's so nice of you.  Yeah, but kiss, kiss.  Love. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  Sweetheart.  My darling.  My darling.  I don't know why I said those things.  Thinking of you.  I don't know why I said those things.  Every other person on Facebook, David is specifically and intentionally rude to.  He always sends people messages saying, I don't know who you are.  They say, hey, David.  Of course you don't.  Hey, David, great job on the show today.  And this is David's response.  Why are you messaging me?  I don't know you.  I don't know you.  Let me go to Matt in Washington.  Matt.  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[02:51:30]  Hey, Matt.  I have the worst deuce chill.  I had to turn my radio off, David.  You are an embarrassment to men everywhere.  Oh, wow.  That's not nice.  What's wrong with you?  Well, easy, David.  Don't keep the gloves on for a minute.  David, what were you hoping was going to happen with this relationship?  Nothing, really.  I just, as I said, I just was playing along with it.  I thought maybe she would come, maybe if I played it up right, maybe she would come here  and to the studio and take a vacation to New York and play and meet me.  And then what happens? 
[02:52:00]  Who knows?  You were hoping for some action or what?  I don't know.  You know what's going on?  You could be honest.  No, I don't know.  You're a guy with needs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Were you hoping to get a little something?  A little something, something?  I don't know.  I was confused.  I mean, if she's married and she has kids, I don't know why she was being like that in  the first place.  So I was confused.  But I was like, okay, I'll play along with it.  Did you jerk off thinking about this?  No, I didn't.  Come on.  Come on.  Let's see.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Look at her big married tits.  Right.  Thinking about the possibilities.  Did you whip it out and whip off a batch or what? 
[02:52:30]  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Do you think about her coming over when she gets out of the car, you attack her like  Travis the Chimp.  Travis the Chimp.  Fucking gouge her eyes out and bite her face.  Not like that.  No.  Not like that.  Stupid Travis the Chimp.  No.  That fucking maniac.  She gives him some wine in his attics to get his monkey dick hard so she can fuck him  and he eats her friend's head.  Talk about a backfiring plan.  That's like giving a chick a roofie and she slaughters your family. 
[02:53:00]  Would you have asked Marianne to go into the Ron and Fez office with you?  Well, a lot of action has gone on in that office.  We'd have to see.  If she came here and if I had a good, if it was like a good face-to-face meeting, yeah,  maybe I would have.  What would have gone on in there?  I don't know.  Would you have squeezed her big tits?  I don't know.  I don't know if she would have, if she accepted and she would go into the office.  Yeah.  Like, would you have said something like, hey, why don't you lie back and let me put  my prick between your fun bags? 
[02:53:30]  I don't know if I would have used those exact wording, no.  What would you have said then?  I don't think I would have asked her to go into the Ron and Fez office.  What if she said, David, why don't we go into the Ron and Fez office?  Then what?  If she said that, then I would say, okay, let's go in there.  Of course you would.  Yeah, but I don't think I would.  And then what would happen?  Now you're in there with her.  She wants you.  What's your move?  I'd probably just be like, okay, and I'd probably agree and do whatever she wanted.  What would be your first move? 
[02:54:00]  You've got potentials listening to the show right now.  They want to hear your game.  I don't know what I did.  Probably start doing whatever, maybe kissing her and making out with her.  I'd probably do that.  A little tangerine dream.  Nice.  The best way to do it, too, is when you go, hey, look over there.  When she looks, you kind of sneak in and you peck your neck a little bit.  All right.  How would you grab onto her big tit?  Yeah.  How? 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  How would you make that happen?  I don't know.  I'd probably just like reach in and grab.  I wouldn't like.  Oh, my God.  That's the way to do it.  Yeah, it is.  Well, you trip her, and when she falls, you go to brace her, and you grab her fat tit and  you go, I got you.  I like that.  I like that.  He likes that.  You like that?  Yeah.  It's pretty funny.  Yeah, it is, huh?  Yeah.  Let me say that to Ron in Georgia.  Ron.  Hey.  Hey. 
[02:55:00]  Hey, boys.  What's up?  What's up?  Hi, Ron.  Hey, that's what I'm saying.  This shit is really creeping me out.  I could just imagine David saying, we don't remember this since the day we spilled the paint.  What?  Oof.  Wow, that was a bad one.  Holy shit.  What happened?  Thank you, Ron.  I just want to play this for everybody.  We were so on it today.  Yeah.  And don't even say that if it's because of us.  We're not that stupid. 
[02:55:30]  There is a lot of anger today over a cartoon that ran in this morning's New York Post.  It shows two policemen.  I have it right here.  Look at the home sales.  Get out of the TV.  Just turn the channel.  The other TV.  The other TV.  Come on.  Come on.  The other TV.  The other TV.  Get him a bitch.  Oh, the other TV.  Reverend Al was talking.  Put the TV on or I'll suck your dick.  How come we can never fucking figure this shit out?  We can never figure this shit out.  Oh, the other TV.  Bring guts gold in.  The other TV. 
[02:56:00]  Reverend Al is fucking out.  Come on, Reverend Al.  The other TV.  Quit the TV.  Quit the cartoon.  Oh, holy shit.  We need it on the other TV.  We're bringing Greg in.  Gus Bell, while this is happening.  Other than you trying to make a very shrewd inference that the president and a monkey is the same thing.  And for the record, we did reach out to the New York Post this morning.  We've yet to hear a comment back from them.  But, Reverend Sharpton, you say that they have a history of this kind of thing. 
[02:56:30]  They were in one of the mayoral elections.  They did a lot of cartoons that many New Yorkers felt were race tens that were actually used in the campaign and that many felt helped sway the campaign.  So, if you were talking about a paper that had not printed cartoons that have the history of this, you may say, wait, what is going on here?  When you have this history and they're not forthcoming with an explanation, one that I would be very amazed to hear, one has to say, wait a minute, here we go again.  Did you or your office contact the New York Post? 
[02:57:00]  We put a call in and, like you, we've not gotten a call back.  What do you want here?  I think that, one, this public needs clarity.  Secondly, if we don't get clarity, I think the next step is to ask people how can you take seriously and how can advertisers take seriously a newspaper that would print this cartoon?  If I or any civil rights organization printed something in our literature that was offensive or inferred a stereotype against a group, they'd be telling people don't donate to us, don't support us.  You can't do this, not explain it, and then turn around and act like you're an objective paper that's fair to all of your readership. 
[02:57:30]  All right, Reverend Sharpton, thank you so much for your time.  We're going to continue to try to reach out to the Post to hear their side of the story.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, boy, here it goes.  Investigators have just wrapped up.  So fired.  Fucking Post.  Fired, fired, so completely, totally fired, fired, fired.  Someone is fired.  Yes, I think so.  Someone is fired.  Good call today, Jimmy.  Jimmy was on that.  Yeah, I saw it.  I was like, that's the good.  I couldn't believe they fucking had a good fucking call.  And to think, at first, I thought Jimmy was making his own joke.  No.  When you read that thing, I looked at you like, oh, my God, you just got us fired. 
[02:58:00]  Anthony did have a look on his face like, what the fuck are you doing?  And to get that look on Anthony, you really had to say something fucked up.  Yes.  I was saying, what the fuck are you doing this on the air for?  Yes, off the air.  Yes, of course, in the office.  If you're not dropping the N-bomb, you're a liberal.  High five me.  But, yeah, so you see this.  It doesn't offend me at all.  No.  But there's something, obviously, like, what the fuck was this guy saying?  Just to bring it all together, because we jumped in the middle of it, this is how MSNBC 
[02:58:30]  is reporting it today.  There is a lot of anger today over a cartoon that ran in this morning's New York Post.  It shows two policemen.  I have it right here.  It shows two policemen shooting a chimpanzee.  And the other policeman says they will have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill.  Do you see the ape playing shot, dead, bleeding?  The chimp is stupid.  The Reverend Al Sharpton calls the cartoon troubling, given the history of racist attacks associating  African-Americans with monkeys. 
[02:59:00]  Sharpton released a statement that says, in part, being that the stimulus bill has been  the first legislative victory of President Barack Obama, the first African-American president,  and has become synonymous with him, it's not a reach to wonder.  Are they inferring that a monkey wrote that last bill?  No.  An ape.  A chimp.  See, there's a difference.  See, people mix that up all the times.  Chimps and orangutans and gorillas are part of the ape family. 
[02:59:30]  They are the great apes.  Monkeys are your tailed things, like your Reese's monkey.  So you're saying that excuses the cartoon then.  Exactly.  That's what I'm saying.  That's the excuse.  It's like, hey, it's an ape.  Okay.  Hey, that's what we were going for when most people have been mistaking it for a monkey.  Thank you.  We hope this goes away.  It was a parody of Clyde from Which Way Is Up.  Or Every Which Way Is Loose.  Oh, Which Way Is Up.  Every Which Way Is Loose.  Oh, whatever.  I mixed up my 70s movies. 
[03:00:00]  With Linda Eastwood?  Eastman?  Kodak?  What?  Hold on.  That was a fucking pile-up.  Yeah, well, boy, this woman is all over the news, huh?  Is that the chimp owner?  Is she the owner?  She's wearing the chimp's clothes.  Yeah, she's wearing a big...  She looks like she's wearing a chimp suit.  Oh, she probably wore that while the chimp licked her ass.  That's what she'd put out.  She'd put banana on her clit.  And then fucking... 
[03:00:30]  I love how these people with exotic animals do believe that they have some kind of...  emotional connection to these animals that want to kill them.  You know, these animals smile because they're scared or they want to eat you.  It's not because they think you're beautiful or they love you.  Well, that's an aggressive thing.  When a chimp smiles, that's an act of aggression.  Yeah.  And here it is.  He's got this toothy grin in every photo.  I want to know how you know that.  I worked with a chimp, believe it or not.  Well, you did.  I did on a pilot.  Mikey.  Yeah, which is always good for your career when you're working with a chimp. 
[03:01:00]  Yes.  I'm an MTV pilot.  Didn't get picked up, though.  Had such potential.  It was a reality show.  Did you abuse the chimp?  Because you knew the chimp couldn't talk.  So when things weren't going well...  Yeah, but then he pointed at me and he pointed at his dick and he made the crying face and  they knew what happened.  New series with a chimp.  It was called BJ and the 20 bucks.  How great would it be if Greg Evigan was mauled in his truck and they arrested the chimp  bear and was fucking his face against the steering wheel? 
[03:01:30]  You heard the 911 audio there, Greg?  No, I haven't.  Oh, wow.  You're doing a live show tonight, right?  Yeah.  Oh, you're going to have fun with the audio.  It's chilling.  It really?  It's fucking chilling.  This woman calling 911.  We could do it again.  What the fuck?  Yeah, they got the audio of this woman.  She's in the car.  Apparently, the gorilla had been attacking her friend.  Yeah.  And she went out to hit it with a shovel and stab it and it wouldn't stop.  So then she had to jump in a car because the chimp started attacking her.  So she was in the car with this car.  And we'll get back to David in a second, but Greg Gutfield from Red Eye is in studio, 
[03:02:00]  the host of Red Eye.  You also heard what she did with the chimp, shared wine with the chimp.  Yeah, Xanax.  Well, and Xanax.  I take Xanax when I fly.  It makes me the happiest person on the planet.  Well, the stewardess is walking off with no faces.  I have no idea what I'm doing.  Where's my peanuts, bitch?  And you gouged your eyes out.  Didn't make the chimp happy, though.  No.  That's amazing.  But it would share wine with the chimp and then kind of snuggle in bed with the damn  thing.  I know.  You're not supposed to mix any kind of anti-anxiety drugs with alcohol because you get totally 
[03:02:30]  screwed up.  So, yeah.  Don't blame the chimp.  All right.  Here's the 911 call.  Listen to this.  What's your emergency?  This is Katie.  What's the problem?  Send the police.  Send the police.  What's the problem there?  The chimp killed my friends.  What's the problem with your friends?  Please.  What's the problem with your friend?  I need to know.  Put the police up with a gun. 
[03:03:00]  With a gun.  Send biplanes to the Empire State Building.  He's killing my girlfriend.  What is the problem?  He's killing my friend.  Who's killing your friend?  My chimpanzee.  Oh, your chimpanzee is killing your friend.  So is this guy thinking this is all a prank?  I don't know.  He thinks it's a prank.  He's killing your friend.  Oh, he's not buying the story just yet.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, really?  Yeah, chimp, eh?  Right.  I got it.  Chimpanzee.  Why don't you get the elephant to make him stop? 
[03:03:30]  Is he hitting the banana hammer?  There's someone on the way.  Look on.  Please, shoot him.  What is the monkey doing?  Tell him what the monkey's doing.  He ripped her face off.  He ripped her face off?  It sounds like a Jerky Boys, an old Jerky Boys game.  That's what we're saying.  And his face was ripped apart.  A chimpanzee's attacking my friend, goddammit.  Send some help.  It already took his glasses.  Then he ripped my face off.  I fell down the stairs, and my nose and eyes fell off. 
[03:04:00]  Get Travis the chimp, I said.  This chimp is very angry.  He ripped her face off?  He's trying to attack me.  Please, please, please.  Okay, I need you to calm down a little bit.  They're on the way.  Can you push yourself away?  I don't want the monkey talking to you.  Please, hurry up.  Listen to me. 
[03:04:30]  They're on the way, man.  They've got to shoot him.  Please.  Please, hurry, hurry.  Are you there with your friend?  I need you to help your friend.  Can you go help your friend?  I can't.  He tried to attack me now.  Is he still there with your friend?  Yes.  Okay, so then back off.  Then don't get any closer, okay?  They're already on the way.  Getting advice from that guy, girl.  The chimp pulls a Hannibal Lecter  and puts the woman's face on you.  Hey, take me to the hospital.  I'm okay.  That's Chimp Pembry.  That's Chimp Pembry, damn it.  You talk to him. 
[03:05:00]  What a hairy bitch.  Did the rancher make him?  Chimp Pembry.  You talk to him, damn it.  Did the rancher make you before Felicio?  Did he throw feces at you?  No.  He was a decent primate.  What do you think there, Greg?  That is, I hadn't heard that.  That is absolutely amazing.  Horrifying.  It's horrifying.  But I know, you know,  but today,  Pete has got to come out  with some kind of statement. 
[03:05:30]  They're going to have to come out  and defend the monkey.  They sure have.  Oh, they have?  Yeah.  See, I'm way behind the news cycle.  Well, they actually,  that's not the end of it, is it?  There's more?  Yeah, there's more.  She's the most,  I've never heard anybody  this frightened in my life.  Is this your monkey  or whose monkey is it?  It's your monkey.  It's mine.  Do you know how big he is he?  How many pounds?  200 pounds.  400?  200.  200 pounds?  Oh.  Listen to me, please.  Where are they? 
[03:06:00]  Where are they?  And he's a chimp, correct?  Yes.  He still doesn't believe her.  Where are they?  I know.  He still doesn't believe her.  He's still just like,  what the?  He's like,  when do I get offered the prize?  It's like a radio prank.  Exactly.  I got you taking Stario Speedwagon.  I know.  I know.  Where are they?  They're going your way.  They're going as fast  as they can your way, okay?  Please.  Please go faster.  Please.  Faster than they can,  but go faster.  Please.  Please.  Oof.  Is the monkey still by your friend  or can you get close to your friend? 
[03:06:30]  He's eating her.  Please.  God, no, please.  She's just watching her friend  being eaten by a fucking primate.  Imagine watching somebody  all that time.  The whole time she's on the phone  and she's staring at the monkey  and he's fucking chewing.  He ripped the girl's lady's arm off  like below the elbow.  Just popped her right off.  Just ripped it off  like a fucking chicken wing.  Yeah, and this guy's thinking  she's going on a serious drug trip.  Like, she's imagining this whole thing.  There's a monkey.  Yes.  He's curious.  There's a man in a yellow hat.  He's curious. 
[03:07:00]  Man.  Someone's saying there's  even better audio  where you can hear the cops.  It's the monkey's side of it?  The monkey was not mic'd properly.  Oh, what do we got there?  Maybe that, yeah, okay.  Maybe that's it.  They tell them  they've got to shoot him  because I tried stabbing him  and he's not,  and it made him worse.  Have them shoot him. 
[03:07:30]  They will.  Sandra, I really have  the fire department close by, okay?  So as soon as the police get there,  the fire department's going to move in, okay?  Please tell them.  Shoot him  because he's going to try  to attack me now.  Oh, man.  Shoot him!  Shoot him!  Sandra, stay in your car.  Shoot him!  Sandra, I need you  to stay in your car.  Shoot him, please.  I tried stabbing him  and he's hurt now, too.  So he's going to attack  anybody. 
[03:08:00]  I can't get out of this car.  I can't get what?  Out of this car.  And the chimp had the keys  for the car.  Like, he wanted to go  for a car ride  so he would run out  with the keys  because, you know,  he would steal the car sometimes.  You know, chimp's  fucking smart, man.  That was adorable.  Just weeks ago,  that was seen as adorable.  Oh, yeah.  He's just like us.  He wants to drive.  Look, he can open the door.  Yeah, let him play  with the keys.  Oh, look, it's Edna.  He's running at it  with salt and pepper.  And then she's looking  at this monkey  holding the fucking keys 
[03:08:30]  thinking,  he can get in this car.  He knows how to use  the fucking keys.  Yeah, he's got her iPod.  He's getting ready  to go for a ride.  Yeah, yeah.  Calls her on the OnStar  and fucking bitches around.  Says he's going to eat her too.  He's got that big  travel mug of coffee.  Yeah.  You don't need that  to wash down her face yet.  You know what's fucking scary  was the fucking primate sounds.  Yeah.  Like, when she saw this thing  doing that to her friend,  I think she realized,  like, I am here  with a wild animal.  Yeah, finally, 
[03:09:00]  after she's been bedding  this thing for years.  Yeah, it's probably  been deep-dicking her.  Yeah.  So nice when he's hard.  Yeah.  You'll like that, David.  That followed you, huh?  Yeah.  What's the matter, David?  What do you feel bad for?  The woman with no face,  the owner,  or the monkey?  Go.  I feel bad for the friend.  The friend that has no face.  Yes, I feel bad for her.  Yeah, that's awful.  That's Siegfried and Roy territory.  She's going to...  Oh, worse than that.  She had nothing.  One of the EMTs  that actually showed up  sent me an email  and said that 
[03:09:30]  it was so much worse  than they can even describe  on the news.  Like, her face  was completely gone.  Oh, you think?  It just dug out.  The thing just dug out  her whole face.  Jesus.  Isn't that wonderful?  It took her nose off.  Oh, everything's gone.  It gouged her eyes out.  Her lips are probably gone.  Everything.  Did it take her teeth out?  Yes, yes.  It also had...  Some of her teeth  were ripped out of her head.  It was probably  just ripping them out  with his head.  Yeah, just like ripping  and...  Can I just say  how hot that girl is  on MSNBC?  She is lovely. 
[03:10:00]  She is lovely.  Although she has  a big fucking  Demi Moorhead  and a little skinny neck.  She is unbelievable.  Yeah.  I just had to say that  because I was going to vomit.  Yeah, yeah.  The whole monkey chain.  I was actually feeling  kind of sick there  for a minute.  When you're hearing  that primal scream,  that's probably...  Oh, you got more?  We got one more clip  that we haven't heard yet.  Oh.  This one might be  with the gunshots  if you listen really closely.  Whatever you do,  just stay in your car.  Just stay in your car.  Just stay in your car.  Just stay in your car.  Just stay in your car.  Just stay in your car.  Just stay in your car. 
[03:10:30]  Don't leave the car  until I tell you to, okay?  Sandra, can you hear me?  Sandra, can you hear me?  I know they just  shot the monkey  and her gunshots.  I heard him.  Yeah, I heard the gunshots.  Pop, pop, pop  near the beginning.  Wow.  Three shots  and he was still alive.  He's amazing.  But that's scary  because monkeys are...  Again, we had the chimp  in here, actually.  He was a small...  Not this one, another one.  They're so fucking powerful. 
[03:11:00]  It's like...  He was probably  just sitting there on her.  He probably...  Because they bite  and they fucking...  They pound on you.  They pound and they bite.  And he probably  downed her eyes out  with his fucking hands  and he probably  had his hands in her mouth  and was just ripping  her fucking teeth.  You know how King Kong  did that to the Tyrannosaurus  in the movie?  Just broke his fucking jaw.  Do you know what?  That's what they...  And played with it.  He probably was like...  Just like playing  with a little seesaw.  That's what they do  to each other  so the other one  can't bite them.  Yeah.  They fucking...  They break the jaw open  and they fucking...  Rip the...  They didn't take 
[03:11:30]  any of her feet off.  I know it ripped  the arm off.  No, I'm not sure  about the feet.  They don't like feet.  Anything that can be used  as a weapon  is they can pull off.  They laugh at our feet  because they don't have  thumbs on them.  You know, I realize  Peter's stance on this  is they hope this doesn't  lead to a backlash  of monkey crime.  Yes.  Because there's so many  that you just see.  Humans coming out  into the street  and attacking monkeys.  Planet of the Apes.  Yes.  Fucking crazy.  There you go.  They actually are all  pissed off  because they say  the monkey shouldn't  have been in... 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  The ape, the chimp.  It's one of the...  I would probably agree  with them on that one.  I don't think we're supposed  to be living  with exotic animals.  No, this woman  took it a little far,  you know.  I think chimps  should be in  a couple of places.  They should be kept  in very nice cages  when they're actors.  Because, you know,  what's funnier  than a chimp  in a movie  laughing your bag off?  In a little tuxedo.  Yes.  Yes.  Or I like them  in little engineer outfits.  Like, they're going  to drive a train.  Stop it, he's a chimp.  Or in medical test facilities, 
[03:12:30]  I guess.  That's another place  where we kind of got them.  You know, go fuck yourself.  I'm going to fucking  give you this.  See if your eyes  turn blue.  Let's see how you do  with rickets,  you silly goose.  Here you go.  Try eating my face  while you're battling shingles.  Scratch your asshole  and buzz off.  Why don't we take a break.  Greg Gutfeld  from Red Eye on Fox.  Jimmy's going to be on.  I'm on tonight, yes.  Very cool.  Nice.  Anything left with David? 
[03:13:00]  Was there ever anything?  David, have you talked  to her since this conversation?  Yeah.  I've talked to her  all the time on Facebook.  She keeps on messing  each other.  Messaging each other, yes.  Messing with each other.  Messaging each other, yeah.  We were a little Freudian slip there.  Yep.  Yeah.  Are you looking  to pursue anything  even though she's  a married woman, are you?  No, I'm not looking  to pursue anything.  It certainly does.  You're using love  and sweetie  and all that shit.  Kiss, kiss.  Kiss, kiss.  Kiss, kiss to a married one.  Dude, all right.  You're a homewrecker.  Let me ask you this question,  honestly. 
[03:13:30]  Let's say you really  cared about a woman.  Okay.  You got married.  She's now your wife.  Uh-huh.  Very sacred bond.  Yes.  And then you look one day,  you turn the computer on,  oh, her Facebook page  is up there.  And right there you see  there's this guy,  this young fucking radio  intern guy,  and he's saying things like  linking of you,  love, kiss, kiss.  What would you think  as a husband  of your wife  if that was happening? 
[03:14:00]  I probably wouldn't  think too much of this.  What?  You'd eat her face.  It's just a harmless,  it's just a harmless thing.  How is that harmless?  She's saying she's sending you gifts.  She's thinking of you.  You're saying a love.  You're kiss, kissing.  I'm just saying that stuff,  just playing along with her.  I don't mean,  I'm not going to pursue her.  Everyone just,  remember this.  If he ever gets married,  you could just fuck his wife.  You're cuckold.  You're a fucking cuckold.  That's the thing.  I'm not planning on, like,  having a relationship  with this woman.  But what about  your own imaginary wife? 
[03:14:30]  You know,  if she was doing  the same thing,  you'd be pissed.  So you had a gal.  You'd be mad.  If you cared about a girl  and she's fucking flirting  with some douchebag,  asshole,  fucking stupid intern  at some radio station.  Some theoretical physicist  who wrote  A Brief History of Time.  But that's exactly  what it is.  It's just a flirting  through a...  That's how it starts.  You know what flirting  on the internet leads to?  Fucking in your bed.  Exactly.  But I'm not going to pursue it.  I'm not trying to pursue it.  Maybe she wants  to fuck you. 
[03:15:00]  We all do.  Fuck you.  I don't think she does.  She's not in any rush  to come down here.  Has she asked you  for any money?  Because that means  she loves you.  Ah, that's true.  She hasn't asked me  for money, no.  Is she from Nigeria?  Does she have  10 million for you?  He'd fall for that shit  in a second.  Oh, wouldn't he?  Is she representing  an airline  where a plane is crashed?  Yes.  That's my favorite.  That's another one  or a doctor somewhere.  Yeah, yeah, no.  David, you would go with it.  You're still pursuing it.  If she wanted to show up,  you fucking asked her 
[03:15:30]  that if she's ever around  to stop down to this studio.  That's right.  That's the fucking line.  Yeah.  I don't know if you know,  but you've used  the golden key to the pussy  that radio people use.  Come down to the studio.  Yeah, what do you think?  We want to have them out here  just to take up space  and look at them?  To talk to them?  We want to fuck their faces, David.  To talk to them?  Stop it.  Just wanted to meet her.  You didn't want to meet her.  Just to hang out, yeah.  Just to hang out?  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  You know me.  We don't hang out.  No, we don't.  Why not?  No, we don't.  I'm more fun than she is 
[03:16:00]  unless you're fucking.  Believe me.  Right.  And even then.  And even then.  Exactly.  Then it gets really bad.  We got husbands checking in.  Mike and PA, go ahead.  Mike.  Hey, if I took my wife's phone  and I saw that message on there,  I'd rip your balls off  and put them in your mail.  See?  There you go.  That's right.  That's how a real man feels  when he's got a wife  or a girlfriend  and they're flirting  on the internet like that.  You don't fucking take that lightly  because the next step is  there's a new dick in her.  Right.  That's how it all starts. 
[03:16:30]  Right.  It's between a man and his wife.  You don't just fucking...  The first message is,  can we fuck?  Yeah.  It starts out nice.  Little gifts being sent.  Things like that.  I can't hold my fucking  shoot you.  I had to say.  This guy would shoot you, Dave.  He'd shoot you.  He'd shoot you.  That chimp.  You're on dangerous grounds.  Let's say hi to James in Kansas.  James.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, man.  Hey, my ex,  my kid's mom,  Nick Cut,  did the same thing.  She ended up fucking  meeting some douchebag  that she had known for years 
[03:17:00]  back on MySpace again.  Yeah.  And next thing you know,  she's calling me saying,  I don't think I can do this anymore.  I hope the cuck dies of AIDS.  Jimmy, happy birthday.  I love you.  No bitterness.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, no,  no bitterness there.  Wow.  There you go.  See, David?  Yeah.  That's angry, man.  Lessons learned  by people's experiences.  That's right, David.  You've got to watch out.  Maybe she's unhappy  in her relationship.  Why would she start  saying this in the first place?  This is the problem  with Facebook.  It makes it too easy  to make these stupid decisions. 
[03:17:30]  You used to have to go  to a bar and cheat.  It was a conscious decision  to go,  you can now fall into cheating.  Exactly.  It's like,  oh, I'm on the internet.  I was researching something  and all of a sudden  I'm fucking a strange woman.  I don't know what happened, honey.  I was looking for prices  of new houses.  And now I'm fucking someone.  Exactly.  It's actually not our fault.  No.  Because it's being piped  into our houses  and apartments 24-7.  You used to have to drive  five miles to a bar.  It's just wrong. 
[03:18:00]  It's wrong.  I hate Facebook.  I hate it.  You presume intimacy  with people you don't even know.  You have people  that are pinging you,  pretending to be your friend.  Commenting on you.  It's disgusting.  But you put it out there, too.  You kind of,  as a celebrity,  you kind of put  part of your life  out there on Facebook.  and MySpace  and things like that.  And then people  just comment on it.  Yeah.  And it's like,  okay, whatever.  But you do.  Like, you bring up  a great point.  Years ago,  you had to make an effort  to get into your car,  drive away, 
[03:18:30]  make up an excuse  as to where you were going,  come home,  make sure you don't  stink a fucking pussy.  You couldn't do it  right in front of your partner,  but now,  while you're hugging  your wife.  It's in the kitchen.  It's in the kitchen.  You're Facebooking.  Hey, I can't wait  to drain your balls.  Imagine there's a broad  in your kitchen  while your wife  is in the living room  and you're like,  I'll be right back.  You go in there,  I want to fuck  the shit out of your ass.  It's amazing.  And then you come back,  hi, honey.  Yeah.  What are we watching on TV?  I'll be right back. 
[03:19:00]  Back in the kitchen.  Let me just fucking  tongue that clit  and I want to do it.  And back,  if it was one affair  you had then,  now you can have multiple.  It is, you're right.  It's fucking not.  Oh my God.  And please,  to all the girls  on MySpace  who I've tried to fuck,  continue writing.  Don't let this be  a reflection on Jimmy's.  I'm not married.  But it's also,  it's like what you're  saying with him.  It's the initiation  of basic texting flirting.  It just snowballs.  Just like,  hey, what's up?  can turn into anything. 
[03:19:30]  And you can't do it.  Very quickly.  You can't even do that  with a conversation  with a girl on the street.  No.  You can't say,  hey, what's up?  That's going nowhere.  But you can just text,  what's up?  And then it's over.  Imagine how awkward  that would be in person  to go through  your text conversation  that start,  hey, what's up?  Not much.  What are you up to?  Nothing.  Bored sitting at home.  What are you doing?  Bored to,  yeah, watching a movie.  What are you watching?  Porno, ha ha, LOL.  And it just keeps  going back and forth.  And within like  ten lines,  you're going,  I want to deep dick 
[03:20:00]  the shit out of your ass.  It's like,  how does that happen?  In any other  fucking medium.  You can be barely coherent  and you can still  get somewhere.  It's amazing.  It really is.  It's wrong.  Or beautiful.  It's wrong in beautiful.  It's both.  It's both.  And inspirational.  I got to interrupt this  before we lose this guy.  He has something  for David.  He's attacking him.  I just want to say  this guy for now.  Rob, go ahead.  Hey, what's going on over there?  Hey, Rob.  Who's this David guy? 
[03:20:30]  David, say hi to Rob.  Hi, Rob.  What's up?  Nothing.  Are you the David  that's been Facebooking my wife?  Oh, shit.  Let's see.  Is this really the guy  or is this another prank?  Uh, no.  This is a guy.  It is?  Yeah.  Apparently, my wife,  you know,  being nice,  sends out a couple hots.  You're trying to get her  to come to New York.  You going to raise my kid?  Wow, it is.  No, certainly not.  No.  Dude, it is.  It's him. 
[03:21:00]  Is it really him?  Yep.  Yeah.  For real?  I just looked.  What's the story, David?  The story is that  she just got an account  on Facebook.  She started  she friended me  she started messaging me  so I just messaged her back  and played along with it  and that's all.  Yeah, rat her out.  Good job.  Played along.  That's all, yeah.  I'm going to come to New York.  Yeah, I'd take her  in the Ron and Fez room.  No, I didn't do that.  She said it, though.  You did say that.  I said it,  but I wouldn't really do it.  You said you would grab her tit, 
[03:21:30]  remember?  I said that,  but I wouldn't really do it.  You said it.  That's nice, David.  That's nice.  Your parents would love that.  Guy's got kids  with his wife  and everything  and you're fucking around  like that.  Regardless of what she's doing,  you're entertaining it.  Jesus.  Don't worry, David.  We do want to come see them  before they leave  the Exxon studio  and we will be  introducing ourselves.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  He actually sounds  kind of nice.  I think you guys  would get along.  Yeah. 
[03:22:00]  You have the same taste  in women.  Hey, Rob,  just keep in mind  he's not here on Tuesdays.  Yeah.  Okay.  Make sure you're coming  on one of the days  he's here.  Does that bother you  to read that stuff,  that little flirting  going back and forth?  No.  My wife's pretty honest.  I mean,  that's exactly how  she feels about the family  and it looked like  she was being nice  and this guy's  trying to seduce her.  I'm not trying  to seduce her.  You were.  You did kind of  seduce her. 
[03:22:30]  I see where Marianne  was being nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me read to you.  But then David's adding  kiss kiss and  Marianne, my darling.  How does this gift thing work?  And then you go up  a little further  and it's all,  thanks,  you're a sweetheart.  Wait, can I stop you?  Why are you calling her  my darling  when she's married  to this guy  that's on the phone  right now?  David.  David.  Don't look around  for help.  I'm not trying  to get help.  I'm just,  I don't know,  I'm just playing along  with it. 
[03:23:00]  It's just an innocent  thing on Facebook.  It doesn't mean anything.  The Care Bear  was so nice.  I feel so honored  to get these gifts.  Thank you so much.  Lots of love  to you, sweetheart.  Lots of love  to you, sweetheart.  Is it innocent?  Yeah, what does that mean, David?  That sounds a little more  than innocent.  Translate that.  You're like 20 minutes  from photographing  your genitals.  Yeah, right.  And David,  believe it or not,  this one I believe  is the most incriminating  one ever  because this,  hope you had a good day.  I thought about you 
[03:23:30]  all day.  That's a bold  fucking statement.  Yep.  When you say  you thought about  someone all day  and then it shows  you should come  to the show one time,  kiss, kiss.  When you think  of someone all day,  that means you're  obsessing with them.  You're thinking of them.  That's a new type  of relationship thing  where you're thinking  about the girl  all the time.  It's fucking like  you're all like  psyched to see her.  You're getting all  revved up  and frothing.  What do you think? 
[03:24:00]  I think that I was  just playing around  and I just said  that I wasn't  really thinking  Do you know  you're using  every excuse  they've used  on that fucking  Predator series?  You want a sugar cookie?  Where's your six pack?  What's coming  with a six pack?  David,  why don't you sit down?  Put the Zima down.  His voice is  quivering all day.  I'm Chris Hansen  from Dateline NBC.  Put the Zima down.  You brought condoms  with you.  Yeah,  they always had  some type of  cheap shit 
[03:24:30]  for the poor  young girl.  At least give us  some good booze  you fucking cheap  Mike Hard lemonade.  Get us some good  a nice glass of wine.  Get us some culture  before you deep  dick that ass.  I like how impressed  they are by the kitchen.  Yeah, yeah.  This is a really  nice kitchen.  Thank you.  I'll be back.  I'm just sending  in the fucking wreck.  Oh Christ,  there she goes.  Let David smooth it  over with Marianne's husband.  Yeah, David,  why don't you  just smooth everything  over?  If this is really  the husband,  It is, by the way.  It's so obvious.  Because after my  first day on the internship, 
[03:25:00]  I have doubts  if it really is  the husband.  Oh, so now  you're a liar.  Now you're a liar,  Rob, by the way.  Yeah.  Thanks, David.  You obviously know  my wife's married, too.  Yeah.  That's really nice of you.  You knew she was  fucking married.  Come on, David,  smooth it over with Rob.  Oh, great.  If this is Rob,  I apologize.  Well,  maybe you'll be able  to do that in person.  I apologize.  I didn't mean anything.  It was a completely  innocent thing.  I didn't mean anything.  I never wanted to  pursue your wife  or anything like that.  It was completely harmless. 
[03:25:30]  Kiss, kiss, squeeze your tit.  Yeah, nothing.  Innocent.  Didn't want to...  Dude, you're...  That is textbook  internet flirtation  that you want  to go further.  David, I'm trying  to help you out here.  Yeah, go ahead.  Just trust me.  Trust him.  I mean, that's...  Just go ahead.  He'll understand that.  Go ahead.  Yeah, go ahead, David.  It's all good.  No, I just...  I apologize.  I'm sorry.  David.  David.  I'm trying to help you.  Why don't you read that?  I'm trying to help you.  Come on. 
[03:26:00]  This will help.  This will help.  The guy's a listener.  He understands these things.  He's not a listener.  He's married.  He's a listener.  He wants to come down and see.  He's not a listener  because he's married?  We have married listeners?  Just believe me.  We don't have smart listeners.  We're thin ones.  You don't fucking know.  You're a stupid intern.  Jimmy knows.  He's experienced.  That's right.  I'm a gentleman.  Take care of business now.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  All right.  What's your name again?  Rob?  Rob.  Okay, Rob.  I'm sorry.  Those fat fucking tits seduced me.  I'm sorry. 
[03:26:30]  What the fuck?  Are you crazy?  I'm sorry.  Are you out of your mind?  I'm sorry about that.  I shouldn't have pursued it any further.  I'm sorry.  You did pursue it.  Yeah, that's a real way to smooth it over.  I'm sure you're really going to see it now.  I'm so upset over this.  I got nothing.  Well, hold on now.  Yeah, hold on.  Give David a chance, really.  Is he at least accurate in the description? 
[03:27:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's a good question.  I can't tell by the picture.  David's trying to bond with you.  I mean, he's not too good at this.  Yeah, David, smooth that out.  That last one didn't work.  Smooth it over.  Go ahead.  Okay, Rob.  My bad, Rob.  Does she fuck like a champ?  I don't think that's really smoothing it over to tell you the...  Oops.  What do you like to find out, David?  Oh.  Oh, shit.  No, I wouldn't like to find out, no.  Yes, you would.  Not according to your posts on her Facebook. 
[03:27:30]  I think I thought about you all day.  All day.  That is something you say to your junior high school sweetheart.  It's one of those very lovey-dovey things that you say.  Smooth things over.  David, smooth things over.  Go ahead.  Is it possible?  Can we double-team her?  I don't think this is smoothing things over, to be honest with you.  Yeah, I think you really should show that you at least care about this person and what she's like. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on, David.  Smooth it over.  Come on.  All right.  Show your care.  All right.  As I may ask, is she taking in the fart box?  No.  No.  Jeez, Dave.  I'm speechless. 
[03:28:30]  You're really winning here.  All right.  All right.  David.  David.  David.  Why don't you smooth things over?  No, no.  Smooth things over.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Okay.  Hey, smooth things over.  Yeah, you don't make this.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Listen.  How's my cock taste? 
[03:29:00]  Now, David.  David.  If you think that's smoothing things over, I think Rob is going to come down here like a  madman.  You're going to know Rob when you see him.  Are you a big guy, Rob?  Good size.  Yeah?  Not huge, but.  Yeah.  You take care of yourself.  You know, you can fucking, you can fuck up, you can fuck a little Jewish kid up, right?  Oh.  Well, David feels like you're not answering his questions.  All right.  David?  Yeah. 
[03:29:30]  Hey, Cockhold, I'm talking to you.  Come on, David.  You got a lot of balls down there in New York, don't you?  Oh.  Yeah.  He's way up in Massachusetts.  You're all brave.  This is like the beginning of a Law and Order episode.  Five minutes later, he's going to be in an alley.  His head's going to be missing.  And then if Jerry Orbach were alive, he'd make a little joke.  Yeah.  Wow, David.  My God.  Oh, man. 
[03:30:00]  I guess we didn't smooth anything over, huh?  No.  We, uh, but, but you, you admit you are flirting.  You admit you are flirting.  I wasn't flirting.  Kiss, kiss, sweetheart, love, thinking of you, thought about you all day.  That's flirting.  My darling.  My darling.  I'm blushing.  I'm blushing.  Why are you blushing?  I wasn't really flushing.  You mean you lied to her about the blushing?  Yes.  You haven't even screwed her yet and you're lying to her.  Dishonest fuck. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah, you're lying just to get in her, uh, in her fucking bloomers.  Yeah.  Her bloomers.  Thanks, Gramps.  Be a man.  Be a man.  Be a man, David.  Fess up.  Oh, man.  You're flirting.  You were flirting.  With this girl.  You were flirting.  A girl.  Hold this karma with this young girl.  Why don't you settle down like Rob?  Find yourself a nice girl.  Look at this one's looking this way.  This one's looking that way.  And the one in the middle has no eyes and nose. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  It was just an innocent thing.  I do apologize.  It's all, it always starts out innocent, but that wasn't innocent even.  That was definitely, you were well, you were well engaged.  You were already like on that road to where's that going?  Where else could that have gone?  Could you have just sustained that type of conversation now for weeks, months, or would  it have gone further?  Would it have gone to talking about meeting each other or, or perhaps doing stuff with 
[03:31:30]  each other?  No, I wouldn't have gone.  What?  How do you know?  You were taking a role in the face room?  Yeah.  No.  You already were talking about hooking up.  But I didn't mean that, really.  You didn't mean it.  I swear.  You have no, you have no proof that you didn't mean it.  You know what you didn't mean it does to those pedos that fucking Chris Hansen gets?  Nothing.  They look at the transcripts, they use that, and they use that as the intent. 
[03:32:00]  But you, my friend, have no defense except those transcripts, which show that you were  trying to get with this married woman with two kids.  You got two kids, Rob?  Yes, I do.  How old are the little guys?  The boy's 11, and my girl's 6.  11 and a 6-year-old.  And there's David going to try.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  And there goes David trying to just, you know, fucking up a family, just willy-nilly, 
[03:32:30]  skipping through life with your shoelaces untied.  Getting to the kids through the mom.  That's how they do it.  Exactly.  That's how they do it.  That's right.  Sure.  Raise my family.  Maybe you can pay my mortgage.  You want to drive my truck, David?  You want to do that?  You want to take over this guy's...  Is that a euphemism?  Oh, jeez.  Don't call her that.  You want to park in my garage?  We got it.  That's right.  You want to back your truck into that smelly garage?  Oh, jeez.  All right.  Take the tailpipe.  Oh, man. 
[03:33:00]  All right.  Well, I got to piss anyway.  All right.  All right, Rob.  Sorry about David's activities there.  David, Rob, looking forward to seeing you come down.  Love to meet you and your lovely wife.  And introduce you personally to David.  Yes.  That will happen.  Thank you, boys, and keep up the good work.  Maybe he can shake your fingers.  All right.  We're out in Massachusetts.  We got to take a quick break.  We'll continue in just a bit.  Thanks, David.  Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Opie and Anthony, we got Greg Gutfeld. 
[03:33:30]  That's right.  Greg Gutfeld in studio from Red Eye.  She's doing Red Eye tonight on Fox News.  It's on at what?  It's on at 3 a.m.  East Coast and Midnight's West Coast.  Yeah, but people could DVR that shit.  That's true.  That's true.  That's the beauty of the ages we live in.  It is.  It is, my friend.  You know, you get a lot more viewers because of that DVR.  We are like the number one DVR'd show at 3 a.m.  Wow.  Nancy Grace is close behind with her box of severed ears.  Nancy Grace, my God. 
[03:34:00]  You get along with those people over there at Fox?  I love them.  Well, you never see them.  It's like the world's greatest high school because all the women are hot and all the guys  are dumpy and fat.  Yeah.  So you can, like, it's just, every girl's a cheerleader.  They're all gorgeous.  Rah, rah, rah.  Yeah.  No, I like it.  It's fun there.  What are you finding good in the news these days?  You're all over the Obama stimulus thing, I'm sure.  Yeah, it's just depressing, though.  We're trying to stay away from all economic crap because it just makes you want to slit  your wrists.  So we go for really stupid stories. 
[03:34:30]  Well, A-Rod was great.  Wasn't it good?  Yeah, that was awesome.  What was your take on that?  He's the lion's sack of crap.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I love that pregnant pause.  What was he doing?  Was there a missing page that he couldn't find, so he just said to my players, and then  he stopped.  I think he was trying to act.  Like, trying to, like, oh, wait, I got to get a hold of myself before I move on.  He was thinking, what would Jeter do?  What would Jeter do in this situation?  We had Nitro on.  Remember Nitro from Gladiators?  And he said that when you look at A-Rod, that's a guy who had the best steroids you 
[03:35:00]  could find, the best cycle, because you can't see any of the side effects.  Yeah, yeah.  So it was clear that he was doing it, but he had just the best.  He had the pure stuff.  He had the pure stuff.  Before it was cut, man.  Not like Mark McGuire, who was like, fucking, oh, looked like they just pumped him up.  And then, like, a year after he's done with baseball, he looks like a little old man  sitting in a courtroom, shaking, emaciated arms, spectacles on his eyes.  It's like, what the fuck happened to this guy? 
[03:35:30]  Exactly.  But, you know, it's idiotic to think, like, an amazing athlete would put anything in his  body that wasn't pure.  Yeah.  I mean, this guy's saying that his cousin shot him up with something that they don't  know what it is.  They're just stupid kids.  You don't do that if your body's worth, you know, a half a billion dollars, which it  is over time.  And he wasn't a stupid kid.  He was already in the league five or six years.  Yeah.  No.  It was amazing.  He could use the stupid kid thing, because the only people that give a shit are the old  motherfuckers running the shit, so that's why he says that.  I still think he's getting it from Madonna, because if you've seen Madonna's arms, she's 
[03:36:00]  definitely juicing.  It almost looks like she has implants at this point in her arms.  No, she's definitely on something.  Well, I asked this question this morning.  Why do you think people hate A-Rod?  What is it about him?  I don't think it's a jealousy thing.  Because there's a lot of athletes out there that are...  He has that...  He has a douchebag face.  Yep.  Douchebag face.  I knew he would come up with...  I think you got it.  Whenever you look at him, he looks surprised at his own success, or surprised at something.  Like he's...  Yeah.  He's fake humble, like...  Yeah, exactly. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah.  It's like, I'm with five women on Valentine's Day.  Look at me.  It's always like he's...  Like, wow, I can't believe this happened to me.  Exactly.  Douchebag face.  How do I get these five women on Valentine's Day that all want to fuck me?  It has nothing to do with the fact that I make $100 million a year.  I don't know what this is.  I'm a great guy.  Instead of knowing why he has them.  Exactly.  I like that angle.  Why Madonna, though?  What the fuck?  She's a 60-year-old man trapped in a 50-year-old woman's body.  Oh.  But she's angry.  I have a friend of mine that had to work on the Sherlock Holmes movie and spent some 
[03:37:00]  time at the house before the divorce.  And she just shouts and shouts at Guy Ritchie, and he just sits in the corner.  And this was about, I guess, like eight or nine months ago.  Yeah.  And he was there working on the script, and he said it was the most uncomfortable, horrifying  experience.  She just pounds in and yells at him and tells him to shut up.  Turn off the music!  And then she storms out.  Yeah, no music, no TV for the kids.  Yeah, yeah.  But she's made a fine living off that pop culture.  Yeah, meanwhile, she can't stop fucking guys under 25.  Exactly.  Lovely mom.  She's got that guy in a cage somewhere, you know, in a trailer, you know. 
[03:37:30]  She likes some nice, unclipped, fucking young cock.  Oh, yeah.  The kid's grandmother is younger than Madonna by, like, a couple years.  Yeah, the new one?  The mother's 36.  Yeah, and the mother.  The grandmother is, like, 50.  Wait, the mother's 36?  The kid's mother.  She's young.  She was, like, 15 or 16 when she had her son.  Of course.  Yeah.  Your son.  Your son.  Wow.  And the grandmother's actually Madonna's age, I think, or something.  Yeah.  Madonna likes young dick, unclipped, preferably a shade of brown. 
[03:38:00]  And that's good for her.  That's your thing.  She likes Brazilian Spanish guys.  Yeah.  But don't go fucking acting self-righteous about how terrible TV is.  Yeah.  And how bad it is for your kids.  How do you think it is for them to see you being fucked all over in every hole?  Exactly.  Pardon my French.  I agree.  What else are you looking at on TV these days?  Ah, jeez.  I don't know.  Let me think.  A-Rod was good.  Yeah.  You're going to do a lot on the chimp thing, I'm sure, tonight.  The story we did last night, which I loved, was this White House reporter, this woman  who complained that the male reporters used too many sports metaphors in the White House 
[03:38:30]  press briefings, and it's unfair to women, when they say, like, you know, he really hit  a home run with that stimulus.  And women are like, what does that mean?  A home run?  It's a home run.  Why?  My argument is that it's actually the opposite, that in businesses, you say, you know, you're  going to clean house, you're going to iron out problems.  You actually use housework metaphors, which actually helps women.  I'm getting fucked. 
[03:39:00]  That's true.  My wife's on Facebook.  Wow, this plan really blackened my eye for not cleaning the toilet, right?  I guess I fell down the stairs again.  Greg, they're calling you fucking brilliant with that A-Rod.  It's the douchebag face.  You finally nailed it.  We've been all trying to figure this one out.  Douchebag face.  Something as simple as that.  And that one you can't prove in court, but yet no one can argue with it.  Exactly.  It's him.  Douchebag face.  Nice.  See, he always thinks of the simplest things first. 
[03:39:30]  Yes, exactly.  Ain't got no gas in it.  It's got a douchebag face.  All right, that must be it.  Douchebag face.  I work for Greg Gutfeld's outfit.  Stupid outfit.  Here's that outfit.  Bill Cox's outfit.  Bill Cox's outfit.  Where's the outfit?  There's nothing going on here.  Some dummy that can't tell the things out of gas.  And a big murdering retard.  He murdered someone for fucking his mother and murdered his mother.  And then Dwight Yoakam, and then he has a biscuit. 
[03:40:00]  Fucking boob.  But it was all okay, because he never slept in that girl's bed.  He didn't want to mess it up.  Remember, he sat at the edge of the bed.  That's right.  And that's when you got his sympathy.  It's like, oh, okay.  You sat there all night, Carl?  Yeah, I did.  It's okay that you kill people then.  Double homicide, schmamicide.  You don't mess up the ruffles.  Here, play with my 10-year-old boy.  You ain't got a Kaiser blade around, do you?  And people call it sling blade.  I call it Kaiser blade.  Danny just found a A-Rod douchebag face picture. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, that is douchebag face.  Pretty much just any one of them.  Hey, give us a preview for tonight there, Greg.  Well, we have Jim Norton.  And Jim has asked me who's on the show, and I have no idea.  You really don't know who else is on?  We got some little kids, some fifth grader, who wrote an editorial on the Daily News about how homework is bad and should be illegal.  Wow, that's cool.  I know.  You are our guest.  You're basically our guest.  Did you do the story of the 13-year-old in England that's a father? 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, it was amazing.  But now they're saying that he might not be the father because she's a slut?  There are four other guys.  Oh, it's David flirting with her on Facebook.  There's four other guys.  She was 15.  He was 13.  Yeah, yeah.  And the kid looks like he's about 8.  Right.  He doesn't even look 13.  Yeah, he doesn't even know what a diaper is.  I mean, I remember his dad asked him, how are you going to take care of the kid financially?  And he didn't know what the word financially was.  Right, yeah.  But now it's coming out that she was fucking three or four other guys.  What a good little egg.  I love this kid.  But now the 13-year-old is insisting on a DNA test. 
[03:41:30]  A 13-year-old.  That's great.  We're having great birth stories, though.  You got that, you got the octomom, and then you have to remember the pregnant man.  It's like every poor pregnant man is amazing.  It's not a man.  It's not a man.  It's a fucking broad.  It is.  What's the name?  She was a hot broad, though.  Yes, she was.  She wasn't bad.  She fucked it all up with those hormones.  Not bad.  One of the best trannies I've seen so far is that fucking 16-year-old singer.  Oh, yeah, from England.  That fucking English girl.  Is that a tranny? 
[03:42:00]  Pop her up.  Yeah.  There it is.  Underwent the operation.  There's a douchebag face.  Every picture now.  Underwent the operation at 12 years old.  Yeah.  Wow.  At 12 years old.  Underwent sexual reassignment.  Yeah, the shoulders are wide, though, man.  And Johns Hopkins.  They've got to figure out how to shave down the shoulders a little bit.  If you asked a 12-year-old guy if you could have a vagina, you'd say, yeah.  Yeah, I'll take that.  I'll just diddle it.  Yeah, exactly.  And I'm going to grow tits?  Yeah.  Fuck, this is great.  All right. 
[03:42:30]  What do you think of Octomom as they find this?  I find her, I'm one of the few that find her strangely arousing.  She has that, I believe that.  For some shots, she looks beautiful.  Yeah, she looks at you.  Don't look at the rest of the body, just the face.  Yeah, exactly.  And the angle's got to be just right.  But that picture of her pregnant was like out of alien, out of alien.  The mass, it was like literally a Winnebago attached to her waist.  It was insane.  She was a clown car.  Yeah, pop one of those up.  Would you bang this?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's adorable.  Used to be a boy. 
[03:43:00]  Still, yes.  16.  Yeah, right?  Yes, and I knew that.  That's a good shot, but there was a shot of her where her shoulders were too wide.  Her vagina's probably too wide.  What?  I think I banged one that was a post-op one time, and I knew it was.  Don't you think you did?  But I didn't know.  It's a vagina.  But something felt wrong.  Yeah, it's the inside of a dick that you're fucking.  That's what felt wrong.  It wasn't a vagina.  It was an inside out cock that you were fucking.  You were docking with this man. 
[03:43:30]  Now, you have a technical.  You have an accurate point.  But again, you don't know that, because it looks like a pussy.  It just feels.  The labia was ball sack.  All right.  Well, whatever.  I didn't say I made a hat out of it.  I just fucking jammed my dick in it and paid the thing.  Was he a retired tennis pro named Rene Richards?  Look, right?  It was venus gerolitis.  Danny, what are you thinking?  Would you touch that?  What's the matter?  What's the matter?  You know what?  I don't know.  Her big head and short arms creeping you out. 
[03:44:00]  You can tell the leg.  Look at the hands.  The leg looks not so much like a woman's leg.  And you can tell the feet are kind of on the large side for a chick.  And then the shoulders are always too big.  And the hair is always covering her face.  Sure.  But Paris Elton looks like it.  She got a Paris look to her.  She's got a dick.  Did you know?  What?  No, because you told me.  Would I know by matter?  No, did you know with the other thing?  No, I had no idea.  Until afterwards, something felt wrong.  Yeah.  The snow was just not right.  No, I didn't lick it.  Onion-y? 
[03:44:30]  Yeah.  Onion-y.  Yeah.  And she had tough acting to act on her dresser.  She had razor stubble clit.  Oh, shit.  Wow, something just felt a little weird, huh?  Yeah, it just didn't feel wet naturally.  Wow.  It couldn't be because there aren't.  I think actually they do kind of pipe in the prostate, though.  So it does drip out that pre-cum in there.  So you're using that as lubricant.  Oh, my God.  That's nice to know. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah.  Why you're describing it, Jim Norton is actually applying eye drops to his eyes.  Yes.  Well, at least I'm not putting them on my tongue.  He's just squirting it into his face.  He's all lonely.  Did someone put these eye drops on my back?  Yes.  Tell me I'm loved?  Yes.  Someone punched the back of my head and the eye dropped my neck.  I'll understand, believe me.  People want to Google bomb A-Rod douchebag face.  All right.  Excellent.  Let's go with a Google bomb.  A-Rod douchebag face. 
[03:45:30]  I don't love this.  So what are you guys talking about tonight?  There's a study out that says loneliness is worse than smoking, which I smoke, so I think  it's true, because most militant non-smokers are friendless.  So I think it's nice to know that people that harass me for smoking are going to be dead soon.  So that's pretty good.  Yeah.  We'll probably cover the chimp story.  And then there's another story about you're not allowed to kiss at train stations now because  you slow down traffic.  That's in Europe.  Europe's stupid, by the way. 
[03:46:00]  It's not as good as Epcot Center.  It's like we got the best of Europe in Epcot Center.  That's all.  I always say that.  It's like, oh, I want to go to Europe and Paris and Spain.  I go, fuck that.  One loop around Epcot and I'm eating the food and fucking nice.  I know I'm not getting dysentery.  It's the best of Europe.  Fantastic.  In one place.  I could go to fucking Morocco and not have my head cut off.  The best of me at Epcot Center, it looks like Europe, but it's run by Americans, so it's  successful.  Yeah, right.  That's what actually works.  You start out, you ever do the bar crawl thing there? 
[03:46:30]  It's fucking great.  You start out at that little Irish, English place, and then you go to the Irish place,  and then all the way around, and by the time you hit fucking Mexico, you're done.  Exactly.  Spent.  Yeah, that is good.  You can go to all the countries, and it's safe.  Don't need a passport.  Yes.  Fuck it.  I'll take Epcot over Europe any day.  Exactly.  All right.  You said you have a hard out at 11.  It's 11.10, so we got to get you out.  I got to run, but you guys are supposed to come on my show at some point.  Yeah, we'll figure it out. 
[03:47:00]  I would love it.  I'm doing the Hannity program in April.  Oh, fantastic.  Yes.  Fantastic.  I'm very excited about that.  He's all hands, so watch it.  Oh, I know.  I've been on that show before.  I grabbed my balls.  I was like, hey, Sean, come on.  He's a growper.  You're a conservative talk show host.  If this gets out.  He has a football, and he's like a Nerf football on the set.  He throws it up.  When you reach up to grab it, all of a sudden, he grabs you.  Oh, that old gag.  As an employee, that is not true.  That is not true.  That Jimmy knows that something like that is done scares me. 
[03:47:30]  It's impossible, right?  How do you know that?  That's something you learn from a host of a children's show.  Yeah, watch this.  You fucking creep.  Yay.  Yay.  Look, that tickles.  You dropped the ball.  We got to do it again.  He-le-le-le-le-le.  Jesus.  That actually does sound like fun, though.  Yeah, it does.  Especially if Hannity's doing it.  I would have been such an easy kid.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, I'm Greg.  I called you a slut.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  Get out of here. 
[03:48:00]  All right.  Take it easy tonight, man.  DVR the thing, because it's on late.  We all know that.  But DVR.  Very good.  Red Eye with Greg Gutfeld.  Thanks a lot.  Bye-bye.  Norton's going to be on the side, man.  I think we're done, too.  Yeah.  What do we got?  Do you sponsor Carbonite?  What is Carbonite on the guy?  I do want to go and fart in that room.  He's a good sort.  He's great.  Why do you think I actually...  A girl, Stacy, who was in during the segment with David, during commercials, she goes,  is it all right if I sit here?  And I was like, that's fine by me. 
[03:48:30]  You know, I don't care.  I...  So you wouldn't fart in this...  That was the only reason?  And he just blasted on out.  Oh, boy.  It was so he wouldn't stink the fucking studio off.  What are you, nuts?  Well, why were you going to leave?  Because I wanted to fart on Derek.  Oh, shit.  I wanted to trap Derek.  I thought you actually had some politeness in you.  Oh, no.  I fucking cut, like, three gasses while we were here before.  I cut it while fucking Gutfeld was talking.  It was an awful one.  It smelled like armpit. 
[03:49:00]  It was a horrendous gasser.  I'm sorry if you get some, but you're married.  I didn't smell it.  I got no shot with Stacy.  So why not?  No, I just thought because, you know, any lady, I thought you were going to, you know...  Oh, please.  Why don't we get David in here to try to pick her up?  Yeah, only ladies that are going to be nuzzling my anus with their face will I not cut gassers in front of her.  All right.  Well, Danny's here.  Let's get out of here.  That was a little dig, Danny, that you were going to be...  Well, that wasn't bad.  What's carbonate about? 
[03:49:30]  Carbonite?  Is that a new sponsor?  You should have fucking carbonite.  What happened to your computer?  What happened?  You should have carbonite.  You should only get carbonite.  You should only get carbonite.  My girl lost her hard drive.  Exactly.  Did Danny lose his hard drive recently, too?  Yes.  Too much whiskey.  I did.  This never happens to me.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, it happens to every computer, faggot.  I lost about 80% of my pornography collection.  Oh. 
[03:50:00]  See?  Oh, not good.  Really?  Yeah, mad.  And just by the grace of God...  Imagine how many years that saved you, though.  Yeah, probably quite a few.  In the joint.  Honestly, by the grace of God and Sam, Opie's hard drive was brought back to life long enough  to get the information off of it, but you were fucked.  There was no way that imposed on that.  I'm one of the lucky ones, because we went to the Mac store, and everyone there said,  nah, you're fucked.  Everyone said, you're fucked.  You're done.  There's no way you're getting anything off this hard drive.  Sam, it was some kind of miracle, and I got it back.  But...  Now every picture shows ghostly images on it. 
[03:50:30]  Bro.  Ooh.  But they have this carbonite thing.  What did it back up?  Carbonite.com.  You know what it does?  It automatically backs up your hard drive off-site, so your house can burn down, and you can still  recover all of the stuff that was on your hard drive.  Holy shit, this is good.  Off-site.  So whenever you're connected to the internet, it automatically just downloads or uploads  your files, important files, pictures, everything that you want to keep.  That a crash would be devastating for.  Wow.  Carbonite.com. 
[03:51:00]  You know what a service like that would cost you?  What are you thinking?  A thousand?  Two thousand?  Three thousand dollars?  A month?  No.  A month.  Two million five hundred and twenty-two thousand.  At Ted's computer backup emporium.  Yes, I back him up by hand.  I sketch all of the photos.  And I write out your information with a pencil.  Boy, that takes a while.  It certainly does.  I store them in the back of my old Chevy Vega. 
[03:51:30]  It's Kevin Spacey's apartment from Seven.  It's just all those composition notebooks there.  How many customers do you have, Ted?  I have one customer.  So far, one.  I certainly do.  I have a food chain, Pathmark.  Wow, that's a big contract.  I'm adding up all the receipts.  I'm still in 1974.  Trying to back all that up.  I am, yes.  They were paying that bespectacled announcer for far too much money.  Remember that creep?  Yes.  I hated him.  He was in Poltergeist.  Yes, he was.  He frightened me. 
[03:52:00]  Yes.  It's always funny to see him curse in a movie.  He said cunt a lot around the Pathmark chutes, I heard.  He said, where's the cunting pea soup?  And then go, cut.  Save at Pathmark.  Now you can get shot made for $3.99 a fucking pound.  Yes, and he would always take the ShopRite scrunchie bear and fuck it when the cameras were off.  To show them who was boss.  Never heard of that.  Yes, it's true.  He frightened me.  So you've been sketching all their files. 
[03:52:30]  Yes, I have been, and they're employees.  Why do you want to keep trying?  I do their ID cards.  You don't have a printer and a computer to do that?  I do it.  Electricity is so expensive.  I'm Ted the Chiseler.  Well, I think, until Ted's freed up, you should go to Carbonite.com, because it's only $50 a year.  You thought I was going to say a month.  A year.  For $50 a year, for that safety and security, knowing all your files are taken care of and saved, go to Carbonite.com. 
[03:53:00]  I have a better service.  Oh, Ted?  I charge $75 a year, and you get five megabytes of space.  Wow.  That's not that much.  That's all you'll ever need.  You just did a megabyte joke.  Jesus.  Upload your Word files.  Any thoughts you may have. 
[03:53:30]  But what if you have, like, I know a lot of people, they have literally tens of thousands of pictures and video files.  That's interesting.  Yeah.  Now, how would you store that?  You have to have a lot of different accounts.  Oh, you've got to divvy it up.  You store a few pixels in each account.  So it costs $75 for each account?  It certainly does.  Keeps it from getting stolen.  Where you at with Bond?  What's that?  Where you at with the Bond?  Yeah, what kind of speeds you got as far as upload and download speeds? 
[03:54:00]  Oh, 14K!  The super of the modem.  You plug your phone right in and zippity-doo-dah right up it goes.  Right up it goes.  Yes!  Zippity-doo-dah.  Right up there.  14K!  You know, for the 50 bucks a year, I'm sorry, Ted, I've got to go with Carbonite.com.  And right now, free trial.  You get two months free if you decide to buy.  So how fantastic is that?  That's crazy.  Use the offer code XM. 
[03:54:30]  My God, they're practically giving it away!  It's Carbonite.com, offer code XM.  Protect those priceless vials today at, not Ted's, at Carbonite.com.  Boo!  Boo!  Big bitch is trying to run out the little guy.  Yeah, they're always doing that, Ted.  Like GE with their light bulbs.  Yes.  How's that light bulb filament of porium going?  The economy has cost me greatly, Anthony. 
[03:55:00]  I remember you only had one client there.  Yes, I did.  And he committed suicide due to the Madoff scandal.  He lost $700 with Bernie Madoff.  His life savings.  Wasn't that the cost of one of your filaments?  It certainly was.  So I actually had him killed because he couldn't pay for the filament.  I wear it as a tie.  Ted is a douche.  He sure is.  Let's hear it for Ted, you guys.  Thanks for stopping by.  We're getting the fuck out of here. 
[03:55:30]  Time to go.  Before I forget!  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  That was nothing.  Son of a bitch.  You got...  Did you?  Yes, Ted certainly did get everybody.  Hip, hip, hooray for Ted!  Later. </pre>
