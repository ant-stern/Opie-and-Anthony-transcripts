<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with seemingly random phrases before launching into a promotional segment for Sirius XM NBA Radio, featuring Jerry Stackhouse and Carmelo Anthony.  The broadcast then celebrated its 20th anniversary, inviting listener calls sharing their memories. This was interspersed with numerous commercial breaks, advertising a wide range of products and services including adult novelty items, eFax, web filtering software, franchise opportunities (Rent-A-Center and Sylvan Learning), arthritis cream, vending machine franchises, car dealerships, legal services for mesothelioma patients, personal lubricants, a joint supplement, and binary options trading.  A brief mention of Valentine's Day promotions on SiriusXM was also included.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a detailed and often vulgar discussion of the reality show *90 Day Fiancé*.  The hosts, along with frequent guest Jim Norton, dissected various couples, including Mike and Aziza (with Mike repeatedly referred to as "Siggy Breath"), and Alan and Kierdini (or Kirliam in one segment), using highly offensive and sexually explicit language to describe their appearances and relationships. They heavily criticized several participants' behavior and speculated on the authenticity of their relationships.  The analysis included detailed commentary on their social media activity, particularly one woman's Instagram account, and even a humorous suggestion of financial aid for a couple struggling to afford a wedding dress.  The discussion also included tangents about the hosts' personal experiences: Opie shared anecdotes about his recent dental work and its complications; Norton recounted a past relationship and its unpleasant conclusion using vulgar language; and the hosts and callers shared embarrassing stories about their own past romantic mishaps, including tales of being “saps” in relationships.  These stories ranged from buying roses for disinterested girlfriends to finding tampons in unexpected places and the cringe-worthy behaviors of teenage romance, including exorbitant phone bills from using 900 numbers and even instances of masturbation during phone calls or related to used tampons.

The show also included a discussion of online dating and mail-order bride websites, with the hosts and Norton making numerous offensive comments about the women featured on these sites.  A segment covered a past "Super Show" featuring nudity and lap dances.  The hosts also discussed Valentine's Day gifts (mentioning gold-dipped roses and the ironic website IHateStevenSinger.com), a caller's plan to exploit a 90-day fiancé visa, their own health regimens and smoothies, and a weight-loss bet.

A significant portion of the show involved a conversation with guest Molly Crabapple, a visual artist.  They discussed her mural painting, use of modafinil, the challenges of the art world (including high gallery commissions), using social media to build a career, and creating art about topical issues.  The conversation also compared the struggles of comedians and artists within established systems and ended with a bizarre anecdote about Crabapple's past ownership of a piranha tank containing a real human skull.

Finally, the show included a discussion about the nature of war, focusing on US involvement in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay. This segment addressed the dehumanizing aspects of war, questionable justifications for military engagements, questionable practices in Guantanamo (including alleged bounty payments for detainees), and the difficulties in resettling detainees.  The conversation touched on the "war on terror," the popularity of reality television (compared to higher-quality programming), and the societal fear exemplified by the refusal to resettle Uyghur detainees. The show concluded with a brief discussion of aging cats and their vocalizations, Bruce Jenner's gender transition, and more commercial advertisements.

[00:10:30]  Jamie's crying  36 years ago today  A lot  Crazy  I think I hit that one  I remember this  Sure, 36 years?  Yeah, Van Halen's debut album  I remember putting on those big headphones 
[00:11:00]  Well, they can plug the jack into the phonograph  And blast in this album  Well, the headphones are getting big again  Yeah  It's not cool if you go with the buds anymore  Yeah  Buds don't even keep noise out  That's what buds meant  The buds  I can fucking hear everything with the buds on  Yes, the buds  I got like  Stuffing buds  I know  In this room, it's the last word I ever want to say  Buds  Yeah  Stupid buds fall out of my right ear  Yeah 
[00:11:30]  I think I got a birth defect  In the ear canal or something  It's too wide  I don't know  I can't get anything to stay in that fucking thing  It drives me nuts  Yeah, exactly  Or a nail  Well  It's not anything  We gotta have David Lee Roth back on soon  It's been too long  Oh my god  Shady  It's just  Shady  Those are those days where you look at the sheet  And you see  Oh, who's coming in today?  And you go  Oh, David Lee Roth  And I'm just like  Oh, fuck  Cause it's exhausting 
[00:12:00]  I think  I don't even have to be there  Oh  Nice  Just sit back and  You gotta  Try to like  Converse with him  And I don't know  Yeah  He's on a whole nother level  And then he wouldn't do  Fucking  He wouldn't do some  Production for us  For us  Right  Why?  Oh, no  He takes the Van Halen stuff very seriously  Yeah  What would he do?  We wanted him to do some song parodies  And he informed us that he does not make light of his music 
[00:12:30]  Yeah  Did he do other production or no?  I think he's done like  Yeah, he does some shit  It was alright  Let's say  We're not going to war with him  Let's go to the wall  Let's uh  Let's go to the wall  Let's say hi to Jim in Jersey  Jim  I'm right here, buddy  Oh  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Jim, what's up, Jim in Jersey?  How are you?  Hey, Chipper  It's another Jim from Jersey  That's funny  I didn't even hear what he said  It's another Chipper from Jersey 
[00:13:00]  That's  My dad  He basically wanted to say that he saw Lady Di's tits  Uh-huh  And he almost crashed his car  They're terrible  They really are terrible  They're boobs  They're flat  Like, not even flat the way they're supposed to be  They're flat, like, from top to bottom  Is she a flat toe?  Like, I don't know what you'd call it  I guess they're supposed to be big if they were inflated or something  Yeah, they look like deflated fucking balloons  Looks like she has a leak or two  Yeah  I don't know  That buggy tits  I can't even 
[00:13:30]  I love  And I love how fucking Marion talks about her body  Right  Looking good?  Yeah, looking good  Losing weight  I don't know what's going on under her shirts  Those things  Like, I think if both of her tits  Like, if you measured them  Right  They're probably three feet across  They're giant  They're giant  I think if we saw Marion naked  I would bet a lot of money that more than one person would start puking  Would just start puking  Just a trollish thing body 
[00:14:00]  Do you know, that could have went either way when you started that sentence  You know, if we saw Marion naked  It could be like we'd be pleasantly surprised  Oh, God, no  You just know  But no one saw  We'd probably just start puking  Puking  Well, because  We'd probably just start puking  How good she looks  You know  She loves it  I've been losing weight  Good for her, but  Look at my butt's smaller now  It's  Shut up  Look at her bubs  Her bubs  She was showing them a lot  During Super Show, too  She loved showing those  Look how they rest on her gut 
[00:14:30]  The top of her gut  Did Jim come?  Huh?  Did Jim come?  The guy?  No  You mean Bill?  Oh, Bill  Oh, yeah  No, we told Bill to stay home  It was too much  Yeah  Hey, you want to talk about 90 Day Fiancé?  Hey, episode four  We got clips  Yeah, I want to talk about nothing but that show  So why do you love this show so much, Jim Norton?  Because me and Anne have been in for a while  And now you're finally in  Well, the clips got me, honestly  Makes me very happy  And  Because I hate reality shows  But these are actually 
[00:15:00]  Even though I know that they do edit it  And assist it and all that  I do believe the basic premise  Is that they are going to either get married or not  Uh-huh  And I like these  I actually found myself liking these people very much  Yeah  I like  The guy  The cowboy guy  Who we thought was a little questionable  A little mysterious  A little mysterious  Yeah  I think he's definitely into her  Yeah  And she's definitely into him  Uh, I like the, uh, Brazilian girl very much  She's beautiful, huh?  She's very beautiful  And I'm watching the modeling thing 
[00:15:30]  And he's a little scared  Oh, he's scared  I like them  Yeah  The Russian girl I think is fucking beautiful  Uh, but she doesn't seem to want to kiss the other guy  Because he'll suck down a ciggy  And then come in reeking of ciggy  This guy is so out of his league  Wouldn't you stop smoking immediately?  He loves his ciggy  Yeah  If you got this, a girl like that?  Yeah, he'll suck one down and blow it up  And then go in for a nice wet kiss  Right, right, immediately  And I feel bad for the  Wouldn't you join a gym and stop smoking immediately? 
[00:16:00]  Really?  Go ahead  Sorry, Jerry  That's okay  I feel bad for the, uh, the guys who are a little bit broke  Like the Asian girl  Like, I think she's  From the Philippines?  She's a nice girl, man  But she just assumed a lot  Like, you come to America  People have money  Yeah  Yeah, yeah  She got one of the broke dudes  Oh, boy, is he broke  Damn  And I don't hate his ex-wife  She's a little irritating  But I get why she has questions  But a lot of that's just the editing  I actually like all of these people  As I'm saying this  A bullet should rip through my forehead  But I really like all four of them 
[00:16:30]  But we're convinced they're all a bunch of saps  Right  Jimmy's taking a whole other take on this thing  Yeah, I don't like Jimmy's  Jimmy's take on this  Jimmy's take on this  We enjoy this show because they're a bunch of saps  They're all nice people who are very pleasant  And deserve happiness  And we're like, I want to see this fail  I want to see her, like, run off at someone  And leave them crying  Jim watches for the reasons you're supposed to watch  Right  Jim likes it for the same reason my wife likes it  Oh, God  That's right, because it's 30 minutes 
[00:17:00]  We don't have to talk to you  Or 60  But no, I really do  And I was surprised  I found myself  Because I did the four episodes  When I was away  All four in completion  Yeah  And I was like, I really like these guys  Like, I just think that they're nice people  Wow  And the Siggy Breath guy  It's like, dude, you gotta quit fucking sucking down  Those Siggy's  Stop sucking down Siggy's  You know, for a cigarette with your dumb beard  Right  Drop a few pounds  This Russian girl, I'm telling you 
[00:17:30]  I know you don't love her  She's a fucking knockout  When she smiles, I see it  But she doesn't smile a lot  Which is creepy to me  She won't eat in front of people  She's got some weird food issues  Oh, yeah  We all know where I'm going with this  Something happened  She's weird  She doesn't want to fuck Siggy Breath  Because he probably turns her off a lot  And Siggy Breath's family and friends  Are convinced that, you know  This broad is using Mike  Gold digger  Yeah, but the family likes her now  After episode four  Well, we're going to start with Russ  And pow, pow, pow  Who's getting a lot of followers 
[00:18:00]  From our radio show  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  She's doing pretty good on the Twitter  I think she's approaching 6,000 out of nowhere  And I believe she's  She's over 6,000  Oh, she's over 6,000 now  Why, you're keeping a close eye on her?  I don't follow her, are you?  I do check her out  I'm very selective  I believe she's following all four people in this room  Yay  Uh-huh  Yes  Nice  Very nice  Did you, um  Did you start following her Instagram, too?  Oh, fuck, no  Oh, man, dude 
[00:18:30]  That's where the fucking pictures are  That's where the shit is  Yeah, follow her Instagram  That's where the good stuff is  Yep  Oh, yeah  None of that cut shit  This is fucking pure  Pure pow pow  She posts these pictures  And it's like, well, off to the gym  And it's like, ah  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  What's her Instagram on, uh  Well, what's her Instagram?  I'm not telling  I don't know off, I don't know offhand  You're gonna have to find it on your own  When you, when you get there  Let us know there, uh  Yeah  Sam  We're gonna start with Russ and Powell  We only have one clip from Russ and Powell from episode four. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, their storyline wasn't really progressed the way some of the others were.  We talked about the apartment that he can't afford.  Talked about the jacuzzi last time, right?  Yeah.  Here's why I like them, though, because they do the apartment bit, and she's like, thank you.  She thanked him because she knew that that was a big thing for him to get the apartment.  I'm just like, ah, good.  I wanted them to get that.  I really am becoming an old woman.  Jimmy looks at it like he would want.  Oh, my God.  I'm not a good shock jock.  This is how TLC wants you to look at it. 
[00:19:30]  I know.  I know.  Jimmy, I could tell what Jimmy does.  He looks at this as if he's the guy.  Right.  Of course.  You look at that like that.  No, not really, because I want to see these guys.  No, I don't want to be any of these shatters.  I want to see them fucking destroyed.  Right.  But you look at it like, oh, I would like if the girl did that to me.  And, oh, that's sweet.  She's appreciative of this.  And you think of it in those terms.  I'm like, oh, this is a sap.  Jim is like seeing all the guys being treated like saps and going,  oh, but she's got good intentions. 
[00:20:00]  She wouldn't do that to me.  That's right.  I think.  No, but I don't think they're treating them like saps, though.  I think that they're not.  They totally are.  They're not, though.  They're foreign girls coming here in 90 days to get married,  and all of them seem to want money.  That's what I don't necessarily believe.  Yeah.  This is what I think happens.  Oh.  These are probably guys that were dating these girls.  Like the one guy said, I've known her for a year.  He didn't fuck the Russian girl.  I've known her for a year and a half.  Online.  Yeah, but they've been communicating for a long time.  If she was just trying to get here in 90, she's hot enough to find another guy. 
[00:20:30]  I don't know if they're fucked or not.  I think some of these broads, they know they've got to start somewhere.  They've just got to get in to the game, meaning get married,  and then they can move on to better guys.  And maybe she's afraid if she fucked him.  Maybe they're afraid if they give that pussy right up,  the guy will lose interest and send him back.  Look at her Instagram.  Look at her Instagram.  Look at that, right?  What is she on Instagram?  Pow 8705?  She'd love her.  P-A-O 8705 on Instagram.  Now her Instagram's going to blow up. 
[00:21:00]  That's her getting ready for the gym.  Just getting ready for the gym.  Just getting ready for the gym.  Go out to the gym.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Unbelievable, right?  Not one picture with Russ, by the way.  Oh, they're probably not supposed to.  That's what the cowboy had.  Uh-huh.  Well, yeah, but notice Russ isn't in that picture.  A little cropping done there.  Yeah.  Why would they not have pictures of each other?  Well, I think none of them on social media are supposed to show if they're together or  not.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  If they're together or not.  Yeah, I think that way it adds to the mystery.  Right.  She's sexy, man. 
[00:21:30]  All right.  So, Russ takes her to a football game.  She's really not into football.  She didn't know what tailgating was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is my fiancée.  Paola.  I love your name.  Where are you from?  Colombia.  Oh, wonderful.  Welcome.  Thank you so much.  So, when are you getting married?  Well, I was thinking about November, December 7th.  They almost killed me again.  No way.  This is a big game.  I started looking at the football schedule.  And it's a pretty big day.  Yeah. 
[00:22:00]  That won't work.  This is still getting seen for the fan, but I don't understand why this football game  is more important than my wife.  You have to teach me, like, things about the football americano.  I always imagined that I'd marry a girl that was a big football fan.  I am concerned how Paola is going to fit in.  Mm-mm.  I thought it was funny that he always wanted to marry somebody that was a big football fan.  That's just...  Like, really? 
[00:22:30]  Why do you need that?  Yeah, why?  That's a mystery to that statement.  I don't know what that even means.  Why would...  Is anybody's wife, like, a big football fan?  Yeah.  I don't think it's a necessity that your wife is into the same sport you're into.  Yeah.  Like, when you meet Pao...  Right.  Whether or not she's a football fan is so far down on the list.  Oh, yeah.  I wouldn't care if she cheered on beheading.  Yes.  Right.  And as a Colombian, she probably has. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, of course.  And have been a part of them and lured people to them.  However...  Because Sosa says so.  You expect me to believe he's mysterious because Sosa says so.  I told you a long time ago not to have ciggy breath.  You expect me to believe the fat boy has ciggy breath because the Russian says so.  Is that your favorite couple?  I don't know.  Russian and ciggy breath.  But I also love the model and her guy.  I think that they're doing okay. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, my God.  I do.  He wants to marry her faster.  He is so insecure.  And, you know, he wants to marry her faster because he knows if she gets too much knowledge,  she's so gone.  But she doesn't...  I think because she's a family values girl, I don't think she will run off on the show.  I don't think she's going to...  She's not a family...  Fucking mind.  She's not a family value girl.  She comes from a tiny little town.  She doesn't know anything.  That's the problem.  She's ignorant of the whole thing right now.  There's a ridiculous innocence there because where she's from, that has nothing to do  with family values. 
[00:24:00]  Once some pro athletes start coming on to her.  Yeah.  She's obsessed with Johnny Depp.  That doesn't mean she has family values.  I think that she...  That means she wants a big penis.  No, not necessarily.  I think you guys are being very negative.  This is like seventh grade Jim, like, who has a crush on a girl but then makes believe  that they're in this loving relationship.  Yeah, the fact that I'm delusional is not questioned.  I understand that.  And I am an ass, to be honest.  However, I do believe in them saying it's correct.  Yeah.  Well, why don't we move on to the next couple? 
[00:24:30]  It's not going to be Siggy Breath yet.  Not yet.  We're going to move on to Louis and Aya.  Aya, whatever.  Aya.  Aya.  Aya.  That's the Filipino brat who came to America from a shithole shantytown.  And it's not much better in America, which I think completely pisses her off, because  she thinks all Americans at least have some money, at least more money than where she  came from.  Well, she's obviously taken off guard.  And then I love the scenario that Jim was talking about last week, that the producers 
[00:25:00]  are just sending this guy Louis into places where he can't afford any of the clothes.  And so Louis, with his awesome deep radio voice, is going, we can't afford this.  We can't afford this.  And I think the attraction for a lot of these women to find love in America is because they'll  have a better life.  But it's safe to say this Aya, Aya, whatever, her life is probably going to be worse in America  than back in the Philippines.  All signs point to that, yes.  She's got this guy, Louis, who has absolutely no money. 
[00:25:30]  I would love to know what he does for a living.  Do they ever say?  I don't recall.  And he's got two kids and an overbearing ex-wife.  And she moved into this situation.  And they went dress shopping.  Yes.  This could be my favorite moment of the show.  It is so far.  Yes.  It's even better than when they went pants shopping.  Same premise, pretty much.  But now they're going wedding dress shopping.  Dude, wedding dresses, when women go wedding dress shopping, it is a nightmare. 
[00:26:00]  The amount of money that people fucking spend on a wedding dress.  Oh, yeah, tens of thousands.  It's unbelievable.  Well, this is where they want to be princesses.  Right.  So they want to get the most expensive princesses.  And wait until you hear what the number was for her wedding dress.  Right.  This is why this clip is amazing to me.  And I felt kind of bad for her, you know.  God, Nana.  He's in no position to have a woman, then.  He's got to get his shit together.  Well, she just wants it to be a big, special day.  And she's not being cunty about it, you know.  And she gets upset. 
[00:26:30]  She's crying, because she cannot fathom that the guy can't afford, I don't want to give  the number away yet.  Imagine flying in from the Philippines.  Right.  And you get to the guy's house, and you realize it's a shitty house with dirty dishes still  in the sink, and he hasn't been there in a week.  Right.  Yeah.  Then you find out he can't buy you pants.  Right.  And then you find out he has two chubby kids that love wrestling.  Oh, those little fat kids he's got.  He's got two chubby kids.  And then he's got a trucker ex-wife with a giant upper beer belly thing happening. 
[00:27:00]  And then you go to the wedding dress store and be like, you know what?  I'm going to turn this into a special day.  And he tells you what the budget is.  Right.  Wait till you hear this number.  I know a lot of our listeners have seen the episode.  Yeah.  This is unbelievable.  Because I'm so far away from my family, and I changed my whole life just to be with Louis.  Yeah, yeah.  I just really wanted my wedding to be extra special.  I was looking for a sheet dress, and... 
[00:27:30]  We are trying to see if we can find any dresses that are decent for around $300.  $300!  $300.  He interrupts her.  That's...  Describing her dream dress.  Before you go any further, we're looking for a $300 dress.  $300?  That's it?  You can't get flower.  You can't get a bouquet for $300.  I don't even know where you find a wedding dress for $300. 
[00:28:00]  Louis, you know, it's really weird.  I've got my weird medicine show.  Yeah.  And that's who I sell like.  And I borrowed from the Philippines, you know.  And she's...  She was living in a squalor.  Yeah, she was living in a shanty town.  Brought her over to do experiments on her clitoris.  It's been made.  $300 wedding dress.  He has to stay on budget.  What does this guy do for a living?  What does he do? 
[00:28:30]  What do they say?  Around $300.  It's not realistic.  So, I don't know.  Do you want to look around?  Yeah, we definitely wanted to take a look around.  Okay.  The music is annoying.  It's like that dopey music.  Like, what's his...  Lex Luthor's fucking fat...  Yeah, exactly.  Ned Beatty's fucking...  Ned Beatty and Superman.  Hey, Mr. Luthor.  Mr. Luthor.  Mr. Luthor.  Bumbling targ music.  They're trying to make this poor guy really look like a fool. 
[00:29:00]  A schlub.  Is he drinking pea soup?  No, it's not pea.  It's a fucking Nutribullet.  Nutribullet, bitch.  But what's in it?  I gave Dr. Ian Smith plenty of time.  I'm officially saying I use the Nutribullet.  That's great, but what is in it?  This has kale, strawberry, banana, and orange.  It's all sugar, dummy.  And flaxseed.  Good.  Why is it so small?  Why does it leave a big fucking...  I go with the bigger container.  Because I'm a bigger boy.  Why do you have a tiny container, you fucking pud pumper?  What's wrong with you? 
[00:29:30]  Nothing.  A little fireplug container.  Oh, look.  Portable.  Look at that.  Easy to stock in the glove compartment.  Shoving your butt.  I feel you.  Yes.  I feel like you're leaving me out.  You didn't ask what's in mine.  Ask Opie what's in it.  Because I know that you've got fruit and...  I'm used to seeing you drink that stuff.  Mine is spinach.  Mm-hmm.  Because you asked.  Okay.  Cow, banana, strawberries, and mango today.  So it's delicious.  Yeah, but I'm used to seeing Opie drink green stuff.  And a handful of oatmeal just to keep me filled up for a few hours. 
[00:30:00]  I forgot.  I didn't put flaxseed.  I put chia seed in mine today.  Oh, what the hell?  Chia seed's a superfood.  Hold on.  It must be a death in the building.  Yes.  Yes, Kenny.  Sam has a baby bottle.  You do.  They come with this one.  Oh, that is funny.  Like, you have the regular-sized one, and then Sam is like the mini-me version.  But I feel like I can't...  This is too small.  No.  I don't know how to measure out my ingredients.  No.  So I start shoving it in.  It's easy.  It's 50% leafy greens, 50% fruit, and then a quarter cup, or for me, an eighth of a cup, 
[00:30:30]  of a boost.  Stop with the fruit.  Just stop with the boost.  They suggest a booster.  You don't need a booster.  Just eat vegetables.  My booster is oatmeal.  Drink the fucking vegetables.  My boost is chia seeds.  I don't think it's very flavorful without...  You have a little lemon or a little ginger is what I flavor these things.  I don't fuck around with too much banana, orange.  It's all sugar.  Yeah, but Sam, GH has a man-sized drink.  Thank you, Kenny.  That's right.  Well, you ate a banana last night, right? 
[00:31:00]  Oh.  I had one with my protein shake.  Oh, no.  Eric is coming in with his NutriBullet.  Welcome to the show, Eric.  This is fighting blood.  By the way, this would have been Dr. Ian Smith's plugs for his blender, but there's  still being...  Well, it's tough shit.  It's time to start talking about the NutriBullet.  We Rock has a handle on his.  He's got a cup.  It comes with three different cups, and they're each represented on the show today.  Well, I've put in mind some Jolly Ranchers.  Exactly.  Twizzlers.  What is that?  A fucking...  A used tampon.  That is really blood red. 
[00:31:30]  A pulpy tampon.  Obviously, his booster is Jelly Donuts.  Look how red yours is.  It really is red.  What is that?  Did this go overboard with the greens today?  No, this is the first time I'm trying to dress a beet.  This is beets.  Yeah.  What else?  I hate eating beets, but I'll put beets in a juice any day.  A good beet salad.  Home run.  I hate eating beets.  I love a beet.  I'll drink a good beet, though.  I think there's kale in it, too, but it's mostly...  It's beet.  A little bit of fruit.  What kind of fruit?  I don't remember.  I got to look in the...  We made it last night, but it's in the book. 
[00:32:00]  Is there a booster in yours?  No, no booster.  You got to go with the boost.  You got to have a boost.  How do you make this shit?  Is this like a fucking regular blender?  No.  No.  The magic bullet.  The blender is pretty much this piece with the blades, so you could clean it much easier  instead of digging all the way in to try to clean blades.  It's a blender upside down.  It's amazing.  My clean-up is less than 20 seconds.  I've never used blenders before because the clean-up was a nightmare every single time.  I can't film our show. 
[00:32:30]  I use the big cup on the weekends.  Make sure you at mention NutriBullet.  Thank you.  I use the big cup on the weekends.  They're really happy that I've sold them a lot of blenders.  Oh, shit.  Drink it nice and slow.  Plugola should be fucking amazing from these guys.  They should probably advertise at our show.  We've sold a lot of them.  They don't need to.  True.  Well, I'll stop talking about it, and then maybe they'll advertise.  But the book says, my pocket nutrition book said, you do have 50% leafy greens, 50% fruits,  and a boost.  But he doesn't know fruit. 
[00:33:00]  What do you mean I don't know fruit?  We were talking about oranges this morning.  You didn't know what a navel orange was.  You just get an orange.  Who the fuck doesn't know what a navel orange is?  Wait.  Hold on.  What kind of orange?  Hold on.  Could you turn this off?  Sure.  Okay.  Say navel orange, I'm going to fucking hit a home run.  Oh, okay.  Turn it back on.  It's on.  So what kind of orange did you have? 
[00:33:30]  Well, I didn't.  I didn't.  Opie didn't tell me because I don't know exactly what a navel orange is.  I bet the Marines don't eat it.  It's just so unfunny.  I love the set up.  I love the set up.  Taste forever.  I love it. 
[00:34:00]  I don't think the payoff was worth it?  No.  It was poorly timed, too.  Yeah.  You just spit it out immediately.  Clottering over the set up.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Justin in Ohio.  Justin.  Opie, my man.  What's up, Justin?  Hey, actually, I just wanted to share a little bit of this information.  Especially from the Philippines. 
[00:34:30]  I immigrated here when I was about 10 in the 90s.  And it is true that Filipinos who live there have this idea that Filipinos who emigrate  out of the Philippines into America are millionaires.  Most recently, my uncle.  My family back home, they live in a region that is very dense with Muslims, very barbaric  people.  And they kidnapped my uncle and tried to extort $3 million out of us. 
[00:35:00]  Like, we're not that rich.  And, uh, yeah, that's about it.  Hi, Jimmy.  Yeah.  All right, Justin.  Thank you, sir.  I was out of that.  Amazing.  I was out of that.  It was an amazing story.  I came in halfway through when I regained attention to that call, and I was lost.  It's your loss?  I know.  It was terrible.  So Aya wants a $300 dress.  No, she would prefer something slightly more expensive than $300.  But she's willing to accept a $300 dress. 
[00:35:30]  But Lewis is insisting.  Because they've got to stay on budget.  I like it.  This one, maybe.  Isn't that pretty?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's original price of $600.  Oh.  I'm sure Aya will look beautiful in anything that she tries on.  But in a store like this, I'm afraid she's going to forget about the budget.  A store like this?  A store like this?  A wedding dress store?  $300 dresses?  A $600 wedding dress, that's not a store like this.  No.  They go for tens of thousands of dollars in some of these joints. 
[00:36:00]  Lewis finds out they're going over budget.  I feel beautiful in this dress, and I think this is the one I want.  Okay, so she found a dress.  Okay.  It's beautiful.  Okay.  It's over.  Definitely very good.  The veil, $75.  All of her alterations, $125 altogether.  Yeah, we'll definitely have to talk more about that.  I really wanted the dress, and it's frustrating and hurtful when Lewis isn't happy about how much something costs. 
[00:36:30]  And he just shut down without asking my opinion.  I mean, this is my wedding, too.  So it's going to be $500 total?  $300 for the dress, and then the veil and the alterations are another $200, right?  Yes, that makes it $500, and Lewis is like...  That's beyond reasonable.  Oh, my God.  Do you know...  This is what an old lady I'm turning into. 
[00:37:00]  What?  Now, I wouldn't actually pursue this, but I will be honest.  I thought of it.  When they were having trouble over the wedding dress, I did think, I'd be happy to send the money.  Oh, Jimmy.  That'd be nice.  I did think of that.  Yeesh.  I know.  The whole reason you watch the show is because eventually the guys will be crying and alone.  Right.  That's why you watch.  That's not why I watch.  You'll feel better about yourself watching other people fail.  Right.  No, see, I want to see them get married and be very happy together. 
[00:37:30]  No.  Because they're doing things we've all done, but they're doing it later in life than we did.  Right.  What do you mean we did?  What have I done?  I haven't done any of this stuff.  You've never been a sap to a girl?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  But you're acting like this is their first time being sap.  No.  This is probably the least sappy they've ever been.  They're all batting out of their league.  Yeah.  Well, that's why this show is wonderful.  It's just a barrel of monkeys.  So now Lewis has to tell Aya, Aya, whatever.  Aya.  Whatever.  You can tell me every time.  I know.  That he can't afford the dress. 
[00:38:00]  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Why are they even, like, attempting to buy wedding dresses then?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay, so the ceremony space is between $25 and $50.  The room rental is $100.  What do you mean the space is $25 to $50?  I was trying to figure that out, too.  Because, I mean, unless it's that per head, which it can't be.  No, it would definitely not be.  A wedding venue for $50?  What is he talking about here?  He said a room.  The room is $25 to $50. 
[00:38:30]  You know, I always wondered if he meant a head, too, when he said that.  But that's way too, that's an expensive wedding if it's $25, $50 a head.  Wait.  Isn't it?  No, it ain't.  Or wait.  No, it's not expensive, but it's.  It's expensive for his.  Oh, yeah.  Wait, no, $50 a head is expensive?  No.  No.  Well, it would be expensive for this guy.  Yeah.  He could mean for the whole venue.  It's expensive if you're trying to buy a $300 wedding dress.  Right.  Okay, so the ceremony space is between $25 and $50. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, the ceremony space.  Oh.  So wherever they're getting married, it's going to cost $25 and $50.  Just to get married.  Just like the room they're in.  Oh.  Just to use that space.  The church, probably.  The church likes a little action.  A little pay-off.  The church likes a little taste when you do stuff in there.  $35 under the table.  You're married.  Right.  Holy fuck.  All right.  Okay, so the ceremony space is between $25 and $50. 
[00:39:30]  The room rental is $100.  As far as a flower shop goes, I know those flowers are expensive, but I'm certain we can  find them for cheap or somewhere else.  Oh.  The wedding is important to me, but of course I have to understand also.  You know, that we don't have that much money.  Ha.  Whoops.  How about leave it gone?  She said that it was $125 for alteration. 
[00:40:00]  I still think that that veil is awfully expensive.  $75.  I don't think we don't have the money to pay for the dress right now.  In a couple weeks, because I just had to pay rent and stuff like that.  So in a couple weeks, it'll be slightly different.  She's like, I could have gotten this in the Philippines.  Since she can only hold it until the end of business today, there's no guarantee that 
[00:40:30]  that same dress will be there.  Were you crying at this point, Jimmy?  I'm a little worried that we're going to have a contract in my dress.  I was not fucking researching where to send your money.  Where could I send money for the dress?  No, let's not act like I'm a big old panty sissy boy, although not as far off as I'd like  to believe.  But no, I felt this was slightly manipulated and set up by the TLC people.  I don't know.  To make them look worse.  Why?  That's a cheap dress. 
[00:41:00]  Because when he said something, it was almost like he was trying to make her cry.  Because he was saying, well, they said they can only handle it until the end of today.  Right.  It was just a weird way of wording it that I didn't necessarily buy.  But can you imagine flying in from the Philippines and being like, wait, you need to wait until  your rent check clears before I can get a wedding dress?  Yeah, I'm getting rich American guy.  What happened?  I'm going to help raise your stupid fat kids, and the least you can do is spend $300 on  a wedding dress and $35 on a veil.  One of them's got a mohawk. 
[00:41:30]  Right.  For God's sake.  You know what I'm going to be dealing with?  Yeah.  Give me my really cheap wedding.  They just wrestle each other all the time.  Uh-huh.  I wonder what fucking CB and the Russian girl are doing now.  What's CB stand for?  Siggy breath.  Siggy breath.  Suck down that Siggy and then go for a kiss.  Siggy breath.  We're going to do their clips next.  Reeking of Siggy's.  Lewis realizes he needs to change things up.  I want to make sure that you have flowers. 
[00:42:00]  I want to make sure that you have flowers and the dress, but because you've already sacrificed a lot.  I want to make sure that you have to come all the way out here and to be with me.  So I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that your dress and your flowers are as close as possible. 
[00:42:30]  Okay?  I've invested my heart and soul into Aya, and I just want her to be happy.  I had no idea until now that Aya was this upset.  And if I want to keep her in my life, I've got to turn this around.  I've got to turn this around.  Keep your chin up.  She should have listened.  I mean, Aya was saying that she wanted a certain kind of dress.  Oh, that's fair. 
[00:43:00]  How's he going to turn her around?  Fuck her in her dress.  Huh?  Just slap something on her.  Yeah.  He can't afford his Philippines bride.  What's he going to do to turn it around?  He's going to get a new job that pays more money.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  If he could do that, he probably would have already done that.  Filipinos come cheap, right?  You'd think so.  What the fuck?  It's not a Russian.  This guy can't fucking afford anything.  Nothing.  This guy needs to concentrate less on finding some fucking mail-order bride and pleasing her 
[00:43:30]  and concentrate a little more on your own personal fucking career choice.  He's paying support, too.  Don't forget, two boys.  I was going to say, in all fairness, we do have to stick up for him a little bit,  because I guarantee that wife gets her taste.  How about instead of a Filipino bride?  She gets a nice, big taste.  Instead of a Filipino bride, open a 401k and just relax for a second.  He should go on the lam as a deadbeat dad for a few years, stock up some cash.  They could afford the $300 wedding dress. 
[00:44:00]  $300?  I don't think they come cheaper than that.  I can't imagine they do.  Dude, I don't buy shit, and the wedding dress that Jess got wasn't even close to $300.  How much was it?  It was a ton of money.  How much?  I don't remember exactly.  More than $1,000?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  Oh, there's thousands.  She looks great in it, too.  There's thousands of dollars.  More than $2,000?  Yeah, I think so, yeah.  Wow.  You get off easy.  Two fat little ring bearers.  Wait, you spent more than two years?  Kids.  You had little kids.  Fat little ring bearers walking down the aisle. 
[00:44:30]  We were just elbowing each other.  Being all rambunctious.  Yeah.  Stupid, sugared out.  More than $2,500?  Oh, tens of thousands.  Whoa.  Not for mine.  They're crazy.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  And we didn't even go crazy, crazy.  Oh, yeah.  And wedding dresses very rarely look good.  Like, it's just a wedding dress.  Like, when you look at a wedding dress, you don't go, like, wow, like, you say, that's  a right dress.  I've been to a million weddings like everybody else.  Can you tell them apart?  And, no.  They all look really nice in their wedding dresses. 
[00:45:00]  Absolutely.  But I couldn't tell you, and I've run the gamut over the years of expensive weddings and cheap  weddings, and they all look within range of each other.  Absolutely.  So close.  Dumb song.  Please welcome Mr. and Mrs.  They've been fucking for years.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah, exactly.  Stuck it in her ass two weeks ago.  Please welcome for the very first time.  I think my wife got her fucking wedding dress at, like, Sid's Pants in the mall. 
[00:45:30]  Sid's Pants.  But it's probably more than three.  Who cares?  Did she have a dress?  Yeah, but it was just a wedding dress.  No.  It wasn't a wedding dress.  It was a fucking dress.  Where'd you go to the jeweler for the engagement ring?  Penn Station.  At a jewelry store.  Nice.  Right?  And there I just fucking...  How much?  Got a ring.  I don't know.  It was about 800 bucks.  I had more than I would have thought.  Oh, please.  That's not like Penn Station bucks.  It would have been 250 anywhere else. 
[00:46:00]  Exactly.  Exactly.  I don't care.  Do you regret getting married?  Everything's worth it.  I don't mind so much now because it's been, you know, great material for the show.  But, oh boy.  Would you ever do it again?  No.  I shan't wed again.  Why?  You gotta get one of these mail orders.  We can play it out on a radio show.  How great would that be?  Can we curl it for yourself?  This is great.  We'll hear it at the radio station. 
[00:46:30]  Then day 89, you tell her to beat it.  Take a hike.  I'll call you a fucking cab.  Hit the bricks, Ruski.  Not welcome.  Yes.  Not welcome.  You see this?  It means not welcome.  It's an American flag.  Picture Ronald Reagan.  See this?  Dude, you gotta.  You don't like exotic for the most part.  Nah.  You might have to go Ruski.  I would have to go either Ruski.  Right.  Or some other, you know, European nation. 
[00:47:00]  Even South African would be nice.  Yeah.  Like those white South African women.  Oh, let's do this.  They're pretty hot.  Day 89.  Hey, lol.  It'll be a wonderful day.  That'll be fun.  Right.  Very good.  Day 89.  Are you excited for our wedding?  Get the fuck out.  Hit it, sister.  That would be a good bit.  We should do that.  We should totally destroy someone's life and dreams. 
[00:47:30]  Like we haven't done that before?  Where have you been?  Yes.  At least going into it, we'll know we're doing that.  That is true.  All right.  We're going to take a break and then we're going to get into Siggy Breath and his Russian  soon-to-be bride, possibly.  They were actually local, Siggy Breath and his bride?  Really?  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  They were spotted in Atlantic City.  What were they doing?  Oh, were they?  Oh, what?  I don't know what they were doing, but apparently there's some kind of a show on sale at the 
[00:48:00]  Borgata.  Plug time!  Oh.  I will be, my third show is still on sale.  The other two are sold out February 15th.  Pittsburgh, February 28th at Carnegie Music Hall.

[00:57:00]  After 20 years, you would want to break too.  But the guys are back now.  Enjoy.  It's the Opium Equity Show.  On Sirius XM.  Weah-weah-weah-weah-weah-weah-weah-weah-weah-weah-weah-weah-weah-weah-weah-weah-weah-weah-weah-weah-weah-weah-weah-weah-weah-weah-weah-weah-weah.  What?  My eyes are itchy.  I put a crazy glue in my mouth.  I had a glue in another tooth.  Ouch.  Just before, when we were eating, I fit into a piece of bacon, I think.  And it, like, it wedged in between the temporary and the real tooth. 
[00:57:30]  Right.  and kind of wedged it open like when you split a log, only half of it.  Ah, it was painful.  We might have to send you out to pasture with Scott Shannon.  No.  This continues.  Thursday, I guess.  Thursday.  The permanents, I hope.  It was supposed to be last week, and then one of them wasn't fitting probably.  My dentist is very meticulous and noticed a little bit of space between my gum and the laminate.  So, she said, no, they're all getting sent back and getting a new mold made and new things. 
[00:58:00]  So, Thursday, hopefully, I'll have this finally fucking done, because I've had it with these temporaries.  Last night, I inadvertently grabbed a piece of plastic again, something wrapped in plastic, and used my teeth to rip it open.  You don't realize how often you just do that, and it made like this crackling sound.  But why do you keep forgetting that you have like...  It's absolutely like flipping a light switch on in a blackout. 
[00:58:30]  It's just out of habit.  It's just out of habit.  You don't even think about it.  You don't think about it.  You don't remember when the teeth are sitting in water next to your bedside?  See, young Sam, the teeth don't sit in water.  They are not dentures.  These are temporary laminates until the permanent ones are made and put on.  And then those will be in the water.  No, my teeth are still under this.  Who?  Who?  Who left the teeth behind on Friday? 
[00:59:00]  Woof, woof, woof, woof.  Was that real?  No, those teeth have been here forever.  Oh.  Whose are they?  Some dentist came in a while back and left them.  Oh.  Interesting.  I didn't realize.  Oh, Big A's dentist, maybe.  Oh, boy.  That guy should get a medal of honor.  No kidding.  Noble peace prize.  Going in there.  Wow.  Ew, ew, ew, ew.  James.  Get that stuck in your head.  Jimmy loves that song.  What?  Ho, ho, ho, ho. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, yes.  Who are you?  Ho, ho.  I like when songs get stuck in people's heads.  What?  Is Edgar's song stuck in your head?  No.  No.  No, that one didn't really stick.  How does it go?  I'm not going to say it now.  Okay, good.  Let's move on to 90 Day Fiance.  Boy.  Okay, good.  We're looking at episode four, now that Jim Norton's a huge fan of 90 Day Fiance.  I really am, and I didn't want to be, because I'm a principal, hate reality shows, but I  couldn't be dishonest.  It was entertaining. 
[01:00:00]  I mean.  Yeah, it is entertaining.  And I know that they adjust.  When you're saying stuff like the dress and stuff, they have to build, or hey, let me  take you to a tailgate thing.  A reality show has to have something for people to do.  Right.  Because we all think, like the Osbournes, they could film for weeks and weeks and weeks,  and the cut down costs, most people don't have that much shit we do on a daily basis  that's interesting.  Like, me in front of the computer is good.  You watching the kids, or you going home to your wife, like, that stuff's good once  in a while, but then they're like, all right, what's happening that's new?  So they have to create shit. 
[01:00:30]  It's, what do they call it, reality?  They call it a sister reality.  Sister reality, right.  Yes.  Because they don't have the time anymore.  Or I think most people just don't have enough interesting stuff happening.  Right.  Again, unless you're doing rock shows, what else are you doing?  These shows, they film in, like, just weeks at that point.  Yeah, they film so much shorter.  Although 90 days, but I bet you they only come around, like, a couple times a week or  something.  Yeah, or every other week or something.  Yeah, I love when they do these shows, and then they talk, it's like, we're on our 10th  season.  Right.  It's like they've been on for two months.  Right.  What are you talking about? 
[01:01:00]  Well, we say hi to Mike and Aziza once again.  Mike's from Cleveland.  He loves Siggy's.  He's never met a Siggy.  He didn't like it.  And Aziza, when she smiles, is very hot, but she doesn't smile a lot, and she doesn't  like to eat food in front of anyone, and she doesn't like to drink alcohol, and she hates  Mike's Siggy's Siggy breath.  Yeah, she doesn't appear to like Mike, actually.  Right.  It doesn't, I don't really see any romance there whatsoever, a romantic connection.  I think she likes him, but I think the sexual attraction is probably hard for her, because 
[01:01:30]  she doesn't seem like she's very sexual.  Like, she's probably one of those cold, she doesn't seem like she likes fucking a lot.  Or she just wants to come to America, Jimmy.  That's possible?  I mean...  That's a biggie.  That's possible.  I'm not saying it's not possible, but...  I think America's still a big get for a lot of people around the world.  That is a big get.  I'd bury her.  So, you know, you deal with Siggy breath for a little while to get your ass in America.  Right.  All I'm thinking is how much I'd love... 
[01:02:00]  I'm debating getting one of these girls.  Wow.  I'm on such a fucking run of just worthless cunts.  Worthless cunts.  Just worthless cunts.  It's time to find a nice person.  It's time to go look overseas?  Yeah.  I want to go on a fucking computer.  Fiddle it, fiddle it, fiddle it.  Right.  Hello, Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, we got this stupid poster click off.  I like the Jimmy.  He's very funny.  I love to a comedy club.  Then let's do it with you.  Let's do this. 
[01:02:30]  Let's get Jimmy on one of these websites.  Yeah.  At least play it out.  Then it'll be up to Jimmy to figure out if he wants to actually go through with it or  not and bring one of these broads to America.  I'll have to go there first.  They'll probably set me up.  Cut my throat.  Oh, that could happen.  Take my pin code.  I'm not going to get a fucking Brazilian.  I'm not going to get an Aziza.  You're not going to the fucking Mexican cartels for these girls.  I'm not going to get a fucking, a Kirillamia, whatever her name is. 
[01:03:00]  A Kirillam.  Why haven't we punched up a site here in front of us so we can see what some of these girls  look like?  Yeah, let's do that, Sam.  Let's look at some of these girls, Sam.  You could start shopping today, maybe, Jimmy.  Mail order brides.  Kirillam.  You could definitely get...  Not Asian.  You could definitely get an AIA.  Oh, or an AIA.  AIA.  Russian women.  Here we go.  Russian women want to meet you.  Jim, look who they want to meet.  TheLadies.com.  You.  Oh.  See, they're talking to you.  Yes, look at... 
[01:03:30]  Which one do you want, Jimmy?  Look at the old guy.  I won't go with the Russian girl.  They don't turn me on.  What about Tatiana?  She'll turn you on.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Tatiana.  Tatiana.  You can't do that.  All right.  All right.  We'll do nothing for me.  You don't think these are the actual broads?  There might actually be.  There's no way these are the actual broads.  No.  No way.  Some of them might be Russian strippers or hookers.  Stop, Jimmy.  No.  Some of these photos were taken in the mid-90s.  There's no way these are the actual broads.  Mid-90s.  It's like...  A little bait and switch is about to happen.  All right. 
[01:04:00]  What country would you like a girl from, Jimmy?  I don't know.  What about Brazil?  Great Britain.  Great Britain.  Canadian chick.  Now, they're pussies.  I hate their pussies.  What's wrong with Canadian chick pussies?  My experience has been everyone I've gotten has smelled like fucking...  Has smelled like a sink water.  Wow.  Seriously?  I haven't gotten any good ones.  Dude, I just fucking...  It's amazing.  Seriously?  Yep.  Don't like them.  I haven't gotten any good ones.  Canadian broads don't... 
[01:04:30]  They don't wash their pussies?  No, no.  I don't think it's that they're dirty.  Just the ones I've gotten have not been good.  It probably has something to do with that maple syrup.  Probably kind of leaks.  You think it's maple syrup leaking out?  It's just leaking into the system.  And fermenting.  And fermenting.  Right.  Just fermented.  What are these girls?  I'm going to blame it on the maple syrup.  Oh, these look like some real girls right here.  Rosebrides.com.  All right.  This is more of a speech.  Where are they from?  Oh, Christ.  Here you go.  Jimmy, here you go now.  These are getters.  You really thought those pictures were real? 
[01:05:00]  This is a real sight.  Yeah.  Look at these monsters.  Who's Anastasia?  Anastasia is pretty.  She's all right.  We're looking at 18 to 20 right now.  Punch up Anastasia.  She's 19.  Where is she from, though?  Russia, right?  Moscow.  She's Russian.  Jimmy, come on.  Moscow.  Let me see, though.  I would date a Russian girl if I thought she was sincere.  Yeah.  And, yeah, this is a fucking knockout smart Russian girl.  There you go.  She looks pretty nice, right?  Right.  She's calm, easygoing, flexible, and open-minded.  I am from Moscow.  I am seeking man to...  You know what open-minded means, right? 
[01:05:30]  Yep.  She'll cut you.  Right in the old shitter.  But she's looking for a guy 22 to 30.  Yeah, yeah.  I want a girl who's like 25.  I'm 45 right now.  That's fine.  All right.  All right.  20, 25.  There you go.  Sammy!  Go 20, 25.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  A bit of a drop-off.  A bit of...  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Who do you like?  Nazgulia.  Oh, from Kazakhstan.  Kazakhstan.  Oh, good.  Nazgulia.  I'm starting to see a lot more girls that look like they take your order down at the Jade King. 
[01:06:00]  She's cute.  Let's see.  What is she looking for, a guy between...  Her face is mushy.  Well...  She's saying man 28 to 30.  28 to 32.  Yeah, but...  Oh, second picture.  Look a little fat there.  Uh-oh.  Is that her?  Oh, good.  You've got to sign up for Rose Bride's account.  Wow, she does look a little chubby right there.  Goodbye to this website.  Look, if you want one of these young broads to like a 45-year-old, you're going to have  to go like Asian.  What? 
[01:06:30]  You're going to have to go like Thailand or Philippines or...  You can't go completely out of your fucking zone.  You're going to have to.  How about Minsk?  Minsk.  Go for that girl.  She's 29.  Here?  Yeah, she's probably a little older.  She's lying.  Let me see.  From Minsk.  Oh, wow.  I know.  She has a black head.  She wants 32 to 39, Jimmy.  Yeah, good for her with that fucking weird-looking head of hers.  Psychonic doll face.  Go back.  Fuck her.  Psychonic doll face.  How about the one on the right?  She has a pretty smile.  She does look like the girl from The Orphan.  Yeah, she's fucking pretty.  I just don't see the 90-day fiancé guys doing it this way. 
[01:07:00]  Why?  Come on, go to her, Sam.  I think they might have.  Google Chrome fucking sticks.  Get the shit out of the broads is what I mean.  I like the second thing.  Their age isn't like Jimmy's bracket.  Compatible?  Jimmy just starts bashing them.  Google Chrome is the...  Stop with Google Chrome.  Fuck Google Chrome.  There she is.  What about Katarina?  It's Katarina.  Katarina.  Let me see.  Hold on.  Well, she's kind, energetic, romantic.  What else is she going to say?  Sorry.  I'm slightly cunty.  30 to 40.  You're out, Jimmy.  Nah, it's fine.  You might talk her into it. 
[01:07:30]  You might have to go old broad.  She's looking for a Swiss man.  Go 40 to 50.  Swiss.  What are you doing?  Go 40 to 50.  We're going 40 to 50 for you, Jimmy.  That's a little easier.  There you go.  This is Moyer's feet.  She needs a guy with a pocket knife with a spoon on it.  This is perfect.  There you go.  Swiss army knife.  Oh.  Tundee.  Tundee's perfect for you.  Tundee.  From Budapest.  What a great name.  Tundee.  She's big and fat.  From Hungary.  She is hungry all the time.  I would only cheer to Pest, you know, Sammy. 
[01:08:00]  She's not from Hungary.  That's her status.  Profile.  They give them profile ratings.  Two and a half out of six stars.  Absolutely.  2.7 out of six.  But she'll cook a good meal for you, Jimmy.  Go back.  I'm blimping.  Hungarian gulac.  Go back.  Yeah, exactly.  Who else?  Who else do you want from this category?  None.  None.  There you go.  Look at this pie face.  What is that?  Let's go to Ho Chi Minh.  Oh, yeah.  That's wrong.  You need an old Vietnamese broad.  Let's click on that picture. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Someone that could tell you great old sniper stories.  Yeah.  Picking off American GIs.  Here you go.  Look, she's got glamour shots, Jimmy.  I can't see them.  Those are glamour shots.  Those are some nice glamour shots.  Beautiful.  Climb.  Thigh.  Thigh.  Oh, look at that.  She's looking for a man 50 to 65.  All right.  She wants to be the younger spring chick.  47?  47?  I want to be friends with her.  This is an attractive girl.  You see how her hair is thinning right? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, that's a nice blonde spot she's got there.  God bless her.  What was that?  A few speckles of napalm that hit her when she was running down that road?  You might remember me from...  Yes.  ...porting photos.  Damn.  All right.  Well, we're going to work on this.  You can't go out of your zone, though, and go like that.  So why don't we talk about Mike and Aziza from 90 Day Fiance.  Aziza tells Mike he can't have strippers at his bachelor party.  They're in the bachelor party stage, this couple?  Yeah, but their bachelor parties are like... 
[01:09:30]  Come on.  Mike's going to go to a bar with his dad, and then Aziza's going to go to a bar with Mike's mom.  And Mike's mom likes to throw him back.  Oh, she does.  And boy, when she gets a few in her, man...  What was that famous line from those newscasters?  When you get a few belts in you...  Oh, yeah.  You go home and do a shooter.  You come back here, a different lady.  Well, this is a different lady after a few shooters, and boy, did she tell Aziza what she thinks of her.  However, the editing on the fucking promos for that was very bad.  Tricky, right? 
[01:10:00]  Very tricky.  Very tricky.  Very deceiving.  They make it look like her and Aziza have a moment that they don't actually have.  Completely different reason why she was...  They do that.  Right.  It's really nice to finally be intimate with the woman I'm going to marry.  I just feel like me and Mike are really getting closer.  It's very nice.  What's she doing?  So they finally fucked?  Yeah, she let him put it in.  What happened was this?  Mike was hanging out, of course.  What else doing? 
[01:10:30]  Having a ciggy.  You're right.  Outside a bar.  It's what he does.  A couple of other ciggy girls came up to him.  Yeah, obviously so set up by the producers.  Ask him for a ciggy, and then they film the girl walking, Aziza's coming, and fucking,  you know, old chimney is puffing away with two fives, and the nine walks down the street  and realizes, oh no, fat ciggy breath is puffing away with two fives, and she gets jealous,  quote unquote.  And that night, she decides to overlook the fact that he goes to bed in white socks and gym 
[01:11:00]  shorts and has ciggy breath.  And says, I can't wait to fuck this guy.  She kind of saw her visa going down the shitter.  She saw her dream of coming to America going away.  Like, I cannot let these girls do this.  Right.  Yeah, but she's a cute girl, man.  She's very kissable on the cheek.  Yeah, you like her?  Yeah, I kind of like her.  You like kissing a good cheek?  I do, man.  If she doesn't get in the country, I'd certainly bring her in for 90 days.  She's got a pinkish hue.  Because you proposed to her?  I don't know about proposing to her, but I mean, just I'll tell her, like, yeah, we'll 
[01:11:30]  get married.  I'll spend him for fucking 90 days just eating that asshole.  Nice.  All right.  What are you doing?  I'm looking at the dresses.  Do you like this one?  Sure.  Oh.  I didn't say a shirt or anything.  Right?  That's nice.  A funny wedding definitely puts a lot of pressure on a relationship.  Do you want to have a stripper on the bachelor party? 
[01:12:00]  It's not really up to me.  It's up to my friends.  Oh.  I love how he tries to still be like a man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A man like.  But then he does that lovey-dovey talk shit.  And he doesn't actually take culpabilities.  It's up to my friend.  His sadness is right under his skin, but he tries to like, oh, I'm a man.  And of course, you know, we're going to have strippers.  It's not up to me.  So they set up my bachelor party with strippers and the pussies are in my face.  Hey, I didn't set this shit up. 
[01:12:30]  And I'll tell you something, I think every guy is guilty of the cutesy fucking talk with  the girl.  Sure.  You know, but you don't put that on television.  You don't do it in front of people.  It's fucking, you know, when he's there going, you do it, you do it, you do it, you just fucking  shut up.  When did he cave his head in?  Oh, he talks to her like that all the time when they were in bed.  Even when they were getting into bed.  Hi, what are you doing?  I'm just kidding.  You shut the fuck up.  And it's especially bad when it's not reciprocal. 
[01:13:00]  Like when you're going like, yeah, I'm just giving you kisses.  And she goes, why are you doing that?  Stop with the fuck voice.  Why do you think that brushing your teeth takes away the ciggy smell in your beard and  hair and on your fingers?  Why do you cut my face smelling like ashtray fingers?  You need to dip yourself in Purell, ciggy boy.  But I just had one ciggy.  Fuck you.  If they want to organize one, then... 
[01:13:30]  Oh, really?  That's how it works?  Snoopy.  If there's going to be a stripper, you're going to have a blood dance for sure.  Guys in Russia probably don't do that.  At the bachelor party, you have your fiancee and she's the only girl you're supposed to  see naked.  Oh, really?  I can't control what my friends do.  You can't?  No.  Then you're just going to have to be okay with it.  Oh, shit.  I mean, I can maybe offer some suggestions, but...  I mean, you can get drunk, I mean, whatever, but nothing else. 
[01:14:00]  You're not the boss of me.  Putting a bunch of rushes out of business.  That's what the best party is for is the last time you're not the boss of me.  You're not the boss of me.  You know, I wouldn't cheat on you or anything.  This is very forced dialogue.  At the end of the day, I still come home to you.  Long day of getting blown by other chicks.  But at the end of the day...  He even says, you're not the boss of me, and then quickly recovers to be like...  Wait, the bachelor party's the last time?  You are going to be the boss of me? 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  He doesn't want girls at the bachelor party.  He don't care about that.  Let's say hi to Dustin in Houston.  Dustin.  Well, so what if you're doing that?  You should be vacuuming, too.  Dustin.  Hey.  Hey, nigga.  What's up?  Oh, hi.  No, I hate that you guys have introduced the phrase, ciggy breath.  It's Jimmy.  I can't watch a single episode with that bald-headed dunce without thinking about his ciggy fucking breath.  Ciggy breath is atrocious. 
[01:15:00]  Male pattern baldness and ciggy breath.  Very good, brother.  Thank you.  Funny.  So, now we're at the bachelor party.  The bachelorette party.  Ooh.  Yeah.  And Mike's mom gets a few shooters in her, and boy, she's finally ready to talk.  What a shithole they took this girl, too, for a big bachelorette party.  Right.  Yeah.  Just a local dive bar.  Yeah.  Four cranky chicks at a fucking TGI Friday's bar or whatever the fuck it is.  How awful.  I don't think his mom likes me very much, and I'm kind of worried how tonight it's going 
[01:15:30]  to go.  These are going to cut loose and have some fun.  Wow.  Oh, come on.  You have to sip more than that much.  Oh, whatever.  Oh, whatever my ass.  Drink some more of that.  Does she have a lisp?  Yeah.  Sounds like it.  She's a little drunk, too.  Yeah, but my son's marrying the director.  Oh, my son.  Oh, no.  Oh, I didn't even notice that. 
[01:16:00]  I didn't either.  My son's got a marrying going.  Oh, I didn't notice, Jimmy.  Good call.  I can't watch this.  I love it.  Oh, boy, do I enjoy a good list.  Oh, who does it?  It's so much fun.  It's enraging.  Fix that.  I don't think his mom likes me very much, and I'm kind of worried how tonight it's going 
[01:16:30]  to go.  These are going to cut loose and have some fun.  Wow.  Oh, come on.  You have to sip more than that much.  Oh, whatever my ass.  Drink some more of that.  Oh, I can't believe my son's marrying the director.  Is she like... 
[01:17:00]  My son's...  She sounds like Chip.  She's got a chip of marrying going.  Yeah.  My fucking son's getting married.  Oh, she said sip.  Sip.  Fucking...  Fuck yeah.  I can't believe my son's marrying the crazy woman.  Can't trust her.  I figured it out.  Yeah.  The plan.  The plan. 
[01:17:30]  I'm going to go to America and marry the guy.  And then the day of the wedding, I'm going to feed them all.  Oh, rat poison.  Jesus.  No.  That's the plan.  Oh, yeah.  This mom is a treat.  Feed them all rat poison.  She's a treat, all right.  I will poison them.  Wow.  Yeah.  And then what?  She starts crying.  Oh, yeah.  Is it in this clip?  Yeah, but... 
[01:18:00]  She starts crying also when she starts talking about how much she's in love.  Right.  Because the mom wants to prove...  Mons her to prove that she's really in love with her.  She says he's my best friend.  And you missed a clip where she said,  Why couldn't you get a guy in Russia?  Yeah.  The mom said that, too.  And that's not why she was crying.  Like, the previews indicated...  Right.  It was because Aziza was saying that he's her best friend.  Right.  Despite the fact that we have to keep a bowl of velaments by the bed 
[01:18:30]  because he is sucking down siggies out the window.  What is it about Mike that you love?  I think it was, like, the most important thing for me, like, in a guy,  is that he's, like, my best friend.  And I'm, like, very, very comfortable with him.  And, like, we can talk about whatever without being embarrassed or, you know, just, like... 
[01:19:00]  I don't know.  He's my best friend.  No, I'm gonna cry.  It's the first time I've seen color cook with your face for a while.  Oh, my God.  Did you hear that sentence?  No.  You didn't hear that sentence?  I did not know.  Oh, boy.  Best friend.  It's the first time I've seen color cook with your face for a while.  Wow.  I don't want you to cry. 
[01:19:30]  I don't want you to cry.  You're just showing me that you have feelings in your heart, you know?  Ugh, shut up, lady.  Ugh.  What a beast.  What a feeling's in your heart.  Fucking beast.  I want to marry Aziza.  Hey, people drastically change because they have a few shooters in them.  A few shooters.  Oh, good.  You go home and do a few shooters.  You come back.  You're not the same lady.  You're not the same lady.  Oh, you're a different lady.  And then what did she say? 
[01:20:00]  Ah.  Fuck you, cocksucker.  Yeah, something like that.  Go with glovescares and see whatever.  Yeah.  So, finally, we're at the final couple.  Yeah.  90 Day Fiancé.  It's Alan and Kierdini.  Um.  Kierdini.  Um.  Oh, right.  Some people saying that the city she's from has a lot of people.  Oh, yeah?  But they set it up on the show that it's, uh, she's kind of isolated in Brazil, right?  They're saying?  Yeah.  That she comes from a small town.  That she's unaware of anything going on.  She comes across extremely innocent and naive. 
[01:20:30]  And, uh, and Alan knows this.  But Alan also knows he's in L.A.  Where there's a lot of opportunists.  Yeah.  And that this broad, uh, you know, is now heading down the modeling road.  And he's losing his fucking mind.  Well, the last thing.  And that's why he said, look, uh, let's speed up and get married sooner than the 90 days.  The last thing he wants is for her to become self-aware.  Right.  Yeah.  It's like as dangerous as a robot becoming self-aware.  Right.  Self-aware.  A hot chick who's with you.  Right.  And then she becomes self-aware that she's a hot chick. 
[01:21:00]  It's like, no, that's it.  It's over.  There's no return.  No returning back to our old programming.  And, uh, and there are the Mormons.  He's a Mormon.  So he drops off this hot piece of ass at his parents' house.  And she has to live on the pull-out couch.  While his, well, while his mom eats man sandwiches and tells his dad what to do.  It's like the fat mom and the skinny dad.  See, you know, the fat mom just rules the roost.  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  But they are very nice. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, my God.  No, but they are.  The mom is very nice, and I think she likes Kirliam.  You have no problem when she bites into a man's sandwich?  I'm not saying that the mom's not the most attractive of gals.  She loves giant sandwiches.  Who said she looked like Captain Kangaroo?  Anthony did.  I did.  Oh, you did.  Yeah.  So, uh, so Alan tells Kirliam not to get her hopes up about modeling.  Yes.  See, he's already trying to knock her down. 
[01:22:00]  And all she's doing.  Because he's like, fuck.  He's like, fuck.  Why did they say she could be a model?  In this clip, all she's doing is driving to the model casting agency.  Yeah.  And so he's like, well, whatever you do, don't get your hopes up over this.  Oh, God.  Just give her some encouragement.  Exactly.  When Kirliam was getting her hair done at the trial for the wedding, her stylist told  her, you've got to model.  After we sent in some headshots, they called in Kirliam for a consultation. 
[01:22:30]  Remember what we talked about?  Don't get our hopes up.  Yeah.  No?  Yeah, that's fine.  Really?  Just curious?  Honestly, I'm more excited to walk her down the aisle and not the catwalk, but I'll support  her in whatever makes her happy.  I would like to see my photo.  It's a big Times Square.  Yeah?  Oh, boy.  They're too far ahead.  Oh, God.  He's getting our hopes up.  I know! 
[01:23:00]  What was that last part?  You're getting your hopes up.  Oh, he's panicking.  Like, she goes on.  They're quickly becoming my favorite couple.  Oh, mine by far.  Yeah, quickly, because he is panicking.  He's like, fuck, this is the only thing I was hoping wouldn't happen.  I want to see the switch go off in her head when she realizes.  It's starting.  Yeah.  No, it is starting.  Even she knows that when you have a girl who says, I want to be a model, I want to be  in the big lights, and I want my picture to be in Times Square, you have to say, I do  too.  That'd be amazing.  I think you can do it. 
[01:23:30]  She says that, and then you go home, and you see more hair falling out of your head.  And you're calling her.  She's in Milan.  She's doing a fucking shoot.  And there's nothing but gorgeous people around her at all times.  And you're back home like, how's the shoot going, honey?  And then you realize that your religious upbringing was all bullshit.  All bullshit.  That you lost this supermodel, because mommy and daddy said not to, you know, put it in  until you get married.  One of those brushes on his sink that's just packed with hair. 
[01:24:00]  He looks at that all depressed.  You were raised under a farce, and it made you lose a hot piece of ass.  I was out very late last night.  With professionals.  Fast forward, your mom is consoling you with one hand and eating a man sandwich with the  other.  You can't even put down her man sandwich to console her son.  There are plenty more fish in the sea, son.  If you'd excuse me, I've got to take a bite of sloppy joe. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, a little sloppy joe.  I think that...  Oh, Jimmy.  I don't even know.  I think that this girl is very loyal.  I don't think that she's going to go off and...  Oh, you're naive.  I think she's very loyal.  Maybe now.  Yeah.  No, but I think she will remain loyal.  She understands American stuff.  I think she loves this guy.  Absolutely not.  If this girl's out...  Picture this girl's out on the beach, right?  She's doing a bikini shoot for something and just prancing about the beach with other 
[01:25:00]  male models and other chick models and they're partying and they're going to clubs.  And she's going to go home to the religious guy?  Yeah, to the religious guy to sleep in the parents' house again.  On the pullout?  You know what's...  Those lifestyles don't mesh.  Yes, they do.  Because she was crying about her mother missing her mother and her family.  She's very family-oriented.  The drugs will stop.  Well, you know what that means.  She's going to now go back to where she was from and do her modeling from there and fly to Milan from Brazil.  You know what's really...  She's not going to deal with another night of charades with Fatso and... 
[01:25:30]  Fucking charades.  Charades and the chubby chaser.  With the castrated father and the fucking...  Fatso and the chubby chaser.  You know what's really unattractive to girls who know they could get many, many dudes?  Yeah.  When the guy they're with is insecure and stomps on their dreams.  Right.  And the insecurity starts showing and there was a couple looks in Kirliam's eyes where she's like,  Wait a minute.  What's up with this?  And there was a, what's up with this?  You know, insecure he is with that. 
[01:26:00]  And that and his poor hair.  When a breeze hits it, it looks like a dandelion.  When you blow on a dandelion.  But those dandelions...  They just blow away.  Little kids blow on his head for good luck.  Yes.  They just fly off.  Those dandelions can hang in there a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  You know, a little bit.  A little bit at the end.  He's plucking his hair.  He's like, She loves me.  She loves me not.  She loves me not.  She loves me.  I bet he's nervously twisting and pulling on his hair.  He plucks his eyebrows out.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:26:30]  He plucks his eyebrows out.  Fast forward, he's going to have a Captain Kangaroo wig like his mom.  Yeah, I'll have another sloppy Joe mom.  Nasty, gnarly, bitten fingernails.  He's just nervous Nelly that she's leaving.  While the father sits there wondering when's the next time he gets to get suffocated by the big fat vagina woman.  I'm feeling a little randy tonight, hon.  Oh, God.  Got to climb on top of that disaster.  Well, I'm not.  My Ajit is bothering me.  Oh, okay.  She's got reflux burps.  Ajit.  From those Big Macs. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, exactly.  All that sauce.  She's cutting reflux gas.  She's trying to eat her box.  She's got gout on both feet and her fucking neck.  She has gout neck.  Gout.  Yes.  While he's eating her out, she says, Pass me the Pepto, would you?  Exactly.  Where's the Tums?  Oh.  Or you can just hear her drinking it while he's licking her fucking...  He's down there lapping.  He's just chugging.  He's lapping.  Smelling that peppermint smell.  Exactly.  Peppermint belches coming out of her mouth.  Oh, that feels better.  He's lapping as he sees the anal leakage. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, you're laughing.  Oh, God.  She blows some little white stuff built up around the helmet, and it's mylanta.  It's her mylanta breath.  It's her anal leakage.  Looks like those little dribs and drabs leaks on the front of a dam.  Right.  They're not pouring out, but they're just kind of leaving streaks.  Just enough.  Right.  Just enough to show that she enjoys a good and mad sandwich.  She's a hearty lady.  She likes to have a second helping.  She does. 
[01:28:00]  She is a fan of the second helping.  Yeah.  Just to awkwardly say that there aren't people coming to dinner every night.  Oh, God.  No, it's just for us.  It's just for us.  But everyone knows why.  Yeah.  She always cooks in the bigger pot.  Did we really need to order three pies?  Right.  Right.  No, just us tonight.  Just want to make sure you get enough.  You know, because it's charades night.  Charades.  Charades.  Family games stink. 
[01:28:30]  They're terrible.  My family enjoys a good fucking game of Boulder Dash.  And I sit there and just fucking go through emotions.  Boulder Dash.  What is that?  We did this break.  Yeah.  It's about like...  The fake words.  They're real words, but you have to come up with a fake definition.  A fake definition.  And trick everyone to pick your definition.  Terrible.  Yeah.  I feel like family game night would just be just hostility and tension within ten minutes  of playing.  Yeah.  You don't want to.  No, then you realize everyone is extremely competitive and they're just a bunch of assholes.  It's the least fun game you've ever played. 
[01:29:00]  Let's play win, lose, or draw.  And there's a passive aggression in the room.  Yeah.  That doesn't look like what you were drawing.  I always knew I was smarter than you.  It's like, can we just fucking hang out?  I don't play family games.  Catch up on the kids or something?  No, me neither.  Let's move on here.  So, Kirliam likes the idea of modeling.  Alan, starting to show his concern here.  We'll be setting you up for a test shoot with a very well-known photographer named Celeste.  And she's...  They're all in.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:29:30]  The photographer they picked shoots for Sports Illustrated.  They realize, what the fuck?  She's...  She's only got one name.  She's Celeste.  Right.  Perfect.  I don't know what her T's are good, but who knows?  Oh, she's Celeste.  Put the mic back here.  Oh, I thought pizza.  The Celeste.  Mama Celeste pizza.  Oh, I'd have gone with that for an unfunny joke.  I went for one that was unfunny and doesn't work accuracy-wise.  I was...  That was the fucking...  The double whammy.  I proved accuracy has no bearing on the comedy of that whatsoever.  I live and learn kids. 
[01:30:00]  Celeste.  And she's shot for Sports Illustrated, so it's a great place to start your first test.  Great place to start.  That's pretty cool.  Of course, everyone wants one life like Maud.  Oh, I love to her.  Party and money.  See, this is what Anne was talking about.  Partying, money.  It's just...  And no more fucking charades. 
[01:30:30]  Come on.  She's not in love in that moment.  No.  Not at all.  I love how she...  The little lilt up at the end like a question.  I could be a mother.  Yeah, right.  It's like, aw.  It's adorable.  Yeah, here's all my money.  Crazy, right?  She's not sitting there thinking about how much sloppy joes she can buy with that money.  Yeah, but I think that she's a family values girl.  No, no.  Not at all.  She's just a young girl that's going to be corrupted by a horrid industry.  Well, that's what he's learned about.  Because she's extremely attractive.  That preys on young, attractive girls. 
[01:31:00]  And, you know, she'll probably get into some drugs.  Fuck a football player.  To hire the hurt.  Right, right, right.  Nah, she doesn't care about that.  Oh, boy.  Oh, she will.  She doesn't care about it because she's never had it.  Yeah.  Yeah, she has no idea what...  She's now realizing what she's missing.  Right.  By being in L.A. of all places.  Holy fuck.  Limos and a fucking sports car.  Right.  Guys picking her up in fucking Lambos and Ferraris.  And then the Zagatins like M&M's.  And then this asshole Alan's going to go,  Don't forget, charades. 
[01:31:30]  Charades.  Charades.  I know you've got to network, but just be back in time for charades.  Mom got a whole bunch of man sandwiches for us.  Are you kidding me?  She has to leave man witch and charades night so she can pop in the limo and go club at night.  Dad, she's in Paris this weekend.  Right.  I'm getting nervous about it.  Right.  Oh, you should have gotten a girl more like your mom.  But she promised she'd be back for the three-legged race.  Yeah.  No, we're only going to need three potato sacks this weekend. 
[01:32:00]  Are you kidding me?  She's so God.  Only everybody like this.  Oh, when you were showing me some of these pictures, I saw a pretty outrace.  Yeah, that one, this one.  This is about other girls.  We'll know beforehand that they're wanting this kind of style, right?  Right.  And that's kind of, I know that in today's market, you know, this is pretty, pretty normal.  Oh, he doesn't want her showing some skin. 
[01:32:30]  As a Mormon.  Um, just, you know, kind of go against what we kind of, what our beliefs, we believe in,  you know, modest dressing.  Nothing too short, nothing too raunchy.  We'll see.  And, you know, that's, that's kind of the opposite of the modeling world.  She doesn't want guys drooling over her.  As an agency, we don't really look for work.  That's, that's, that's very, um, that's very, uh, comforting.  Yeah.  He's out of his mind.  Oh, he's going to fucking use his fucking mind. 
[01:33:00]  And that lady was just humoring him, like, oh, fuck, we'll get, we'll get this chick showing  all sorts of skin.  Just give me a couple of weeks.  Because he knows nothing makes him more uncomfortable than Kirliam becoming aware that she's hot.  But at the same time, he can't tell her not to do this because then she'll leave him anyway.  It's like, what, you tell me what to do?  Yeah.  I don't like that.  Exactly.  So he's fucked on either side.  Yep.  And he can't pretend to be okay with the modeling thing. 
[01:33:30]  He's doing a terrible job of it.  Horrid.  Kirliam is not answering her phone.  Oh, boy.  This is when she's on the shoot.  Oh.  Boy, we've, we've all, uh, we've all been here.  Oh, yeah.  Let's be honest with each other.  We've all been here.  Where is she?  Fucking bitch.  Right.  Oh, we've all, especially when you feel like you're out of your league.  So then your mind just fucking, fucking starts playing tricks on you.  Oh, yeah.  Calling from Syracuse to my girlfriend's dorm in Westchester.  Oh, Christ. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, Christ.  The worst.  I love you.  She wasn't picking up and then she finally would.  There's music and, oh, we're just having fun.  I'll call you back later.  Oh, hang on a second.  How did that work out for you?  It worked.  Bad.  Bad.  Long distance relationships with girls not answering phones could be the worst thing that could happen to a guy.  Oh, the worst.  It's horrendous.  But then, of course, me, anytime I was out.  Oh, hang on a second.  I got a phone call I got to take.  Anthony, could you please call before you just, don't just drop by my dorm.  Could you call?  Okay. 
[01:34:30]  Okay, don't leave me.  All right, don't leave me.  You okay with me?  Fuck the other guys?  Oh, yes.  For me, it was this girl, Jen, who was at Boston College.  Oh, no.  And I was in Rochester and did the old drive to Boston.  And she was like a summer love fling thing that I thought was more than that.  And showed up at her dorm because I called.  She's like, oh, you're here. 
[01:35:00]  Like, it was weird.  Like, oh, you're here.  Oh, wow, you're here.  It was like, oh, you're here?  And I'm like, yeah, man, you want to, like, you know, get lunch or I can pick you up.  Well, and I finally talked her into allowing me to go to her dorm.  And then she showed up in the lobby area of the fucking dorm area.  And we had small talk.  But then stupid here finally started to figure it all out in my head.  Like, oh, I think she doesn't want me here. 
[01:35:30]  I get it.  Oh, man.  Oh, oh, I see what's going on here.  And she told her new athlete boyfriend, oh, it's Greg the weenie.  I go down and talk to him.  Oh, probably.  Oh, no.  And it was just polite talk.  I'm like, but the summer was amazing for us, I thought.  Oh, no.  The hopster doesn't realize the summer is over.  Summer's over.  Summer, love it.  She Danny Zuko'd you.  Exactly.  That's what I did as I walked out the fucking dorm.  Yes.  You jumped in that car going up into the sky all by yourself. 
[01:36:00]  How does it go from, like, holy fuck, I think we're in love, to polite talk in a lobby area.  It's just like Labor Day, right?  It's all sunny, warm.  You're at the beach.  And then the day after Labor Day, it's dismal, cold, and cloudy.  No one's on the beach.  You're like, what the fuck happened?  You should have showed up in your leather pants and started saying that you had chills  that were multiplying.  Multiplying.  Yeah.  I really liked her a lot at the time.  Oh, man.  And that was the last time I ever talked to her.  Is it painful? 
[01:36:30]  Oh, it was brutal.  She's the one that left the message for you?  Huh?  Fucking new guys or no?  No, that's the Buffalo, bro.  Tell me more.  Tell me more.  Right.  Yeah.  That was the Buffalo, bro.  That's a story for another day.  Wow.  Yeah.  Did you get very far?  That bitch.  Wow.  That's fucking not nice.  It was just like small talk.  I'm like, what are you talking about?  Remember Montauk?  Remember going to the beaches?  Remember?  Remember?  Yeah, she remembers.  Fucked, right? 
[01:37:00]  She wants to keep it a memory.  Yeah.  Nothing more.  Go away.  She got a hold of some college dick.  Yeah.  That was it.  Oh, young Greg showed up and no part of you.  But like most guys, when you're in sap mode, you're in denial the whole time.  You're like, oh, she's probably busy.  She probably like, I don't know, went for a run and wants to shower or something before  I get there.  Yeah.  That's why, you know, she told me not to just show up.  Right.  I understand that.  Like you're always reasoning.  She wants to look good. 
[01:37:30]  You're reasoning in your head.  Somebody's not handling their new college workload well.  Right.  You know, first of all, she's busy.  Right.  She's busy.  And if I just show up, she can't do the homework.  Right.  Right.  And if I just show up and she's in a robe with her hair up and no makeup on, she'll feel  bad.  I guess I'm too much of a distraction for her.  And I remember like when I finally realized, which I should have realized way sooner, I  couldn't, I wanted out of there so fucking fast.  When did you realize, what was the moment that you realized? 
[01:38:00]  When she walked down and like, I was like, you know, you would think, okay, a couple  minutes down here, then we'll, you know, we'll go to like, just.  Oh, go up to the room.  Yeah.  But I wasn't, I was just, yeah.  So maybe she could get her things and then we could leave type of shit.  I wasn't even like, you know, fast forwarding to hopefully, you know, jumping in bed.  You were just a visitor.  Yeah.  But I'm thinking, okay, she'll now say, all right, well, come on up.  I can't wait to show you my dorm room.  I can't wait to show you. 
[01:38:30]  And then let me.  There'll probably be a photo of you in there.  Yeah.  Let's, let's.  Yeah.  And then let me get my stuff and I got to, you know, you know, whatever.  And then we'll leave.  And there's none of that.  And then I'm just awkwardly talking, waiting for that moment.  I'm like, oh my God, I see what's going on here.  You don't want me here at all.  And you were like, I don't have any other business being in Boston.  Oh, no.  I really looked at that.  No, a lot of.  No, there was other people.  It was, it was Geneseo.  A whole bunch of Geneseo people moved to Boston.  So we were always going there.  Did you go to lunch? 
[01:39:00]  No.  Oh, no.  That was the long drive home.  It was fucking brutal.  I stayed in Boston.  Like I said.  Fucking bitch.  Because back then, you jumped in a car with a whole bunch of dudes.  I didn't drive myself.  So I had to wait it out.  I didn't want to be in Boston.  You couldn't leave.  Oh, man.  You had to hang.  I had to wait the fuck to get the fuck out of there.  So what did she, did she hug you goodbye?  Dude, this is so many years ago.  I don't remember all the details.  I don't want to make it up for the radio.  I love it.  I just remember it was awkward.  I don't know if there was a hug. 
[01:39:30]  But I knew that, wow, I will probably never talk to her again.  Not because I'm sitting there going, you bitch or anything.  I realized, oh, fuck, she's so moved on from me.  Oh, yeah.  How long had it been since you saw her previously?  I don't know.  Not long.  More than two weeks?  Well, I mean, summer's over.  She goes to college.  And I'm in Rochester doing my thing.  So it might have taken a few weeks to get up there.  Had you been talking on the phone?  It could have been a month.  It could have been a month, probably. 
[01:40:00]  She got her first kiss with black dick and that was it for you.  Black dick.  Had you been talking on the phone with her and stuff?  Fuck yeah.  We were keeping in touch.  How was it on the phone?  Was she like, cool?  See, like I said, this is, you know, we're talking.  But there were probably signs.  This could be like 10 years ago.  This could be like 10 years ago.  Thanks, Jimmy.  This could be 20-something years ago.  She was afraid you'd see all the salt blow in her room and the fucking size 14 basketball  shoes under the bed. 
[01:40:30]  Long shorts.  Hey, what are these?  Let's just put it this way.  She's an old broad now.  Oh, nice.  And those perky tits are certainly nowhere near perky anymore.  Whose Billy Ocean CD is this?  She could be in her 40s now.  That's good, fucker.  She got greedy in the moment and now she's old and fucking with some slug.  Who the fuck knows?  I never, that was it.  Who knows?  She could be.  You should look up on Facebook.  Yeah, we could probably try to do that. 
[01:41:00]  Do you remember her name?  I mean...  Yeah.  Oh, just look it up.  Oh, yeah.  I remember her name.  How could you forget?  Conti McFlatlabor.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't have a car at the time, too.  And I would have had...  I had to.  I did a couple of times.  She was going to Dowling College down there.  Right.  Just after she left Quinnipiac.  And I used to have to take the train from Huntington to Dowling College.  How long was that?  It was so long because it was three different rail lines on the Long Island Railroad that you had to take. 
[01:41:30]  But you would do anything if you didn't...  Oh, I'm just sitting on that...  You got bit by the love bug.  Ning, ning, ning, ning, ning, ning, ning.  Right.  You would...  Ning, ning, ning, ning, ning, ning, ning, ning.  I was on that train for fucking hours.  Just wanted to give you a call.  I'm getting on the train now.  It's going to be a couple hours.  Oh, good.  And then I fucking, like...  I'm walking down that Main Street there in Oakdale for Dowling.  And it's like, oh, well, Flores, I'll get a rose.  Stop.  Ew. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, yes, I did.  Ew.  To be honest, I think I did something similar to that.  I'll get a rose.  She'll like me more.  She's going to be so excited to see me.  She's going to bring our relationship back together again.  In fairness to these girls, there's nothing worse than your new friends at college and you're meeting these new guys.  And fucking schlobo, time placekeeper, shows up.  Old douchebag shows up.  With his train ticket in his pocket.  Her new fun fucking college drinking friends. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  And me without a car because they repoed it.  Army jacket with a train ticket.  Exactly.  She was a freshman in my case and I was out of college.  So it was like a four or five year difference.  Four-ish difference.  So, yeah, maybe five because I was definitely out of college and I might have, the officer might have did an extra year at college because he was having fun.  There you go.  You just stuck around?  Just stuck around.  I was a stick around guy thinking that I could keep the dream going. 
[01:43:00]  Eight years of college down the fucking drain.  The worst thing you could do is walk around a college campus when you don't go there anymore.  So what would you do?  Everyone looks at you.  I'm like, dude, I'm only a year older than you fucks.  Relax.  Doesn't matter.  But what would you do?  Yeah.  What?  Did you get an apartment and then just walk around campus?  I started my radio career close by, so I had an excuse, but it was nice that I was just on the outskirts of the college.  And so every now and then you'd come in?  Every now and then.  I hung out at the bars every night with them.  Are you kidding me?  I was keeping the dream alive. 
[01:43:30]  I'm keeping the dream alive.  Wait, so what happened when you showed up at fucking this dowling college?  Yeah, go ahead.  So now you got your rose.  With a rose and a fucking dumb army jacket?  Oh, I showed up.  With no ride.  No ride.  Did she know you were coming?  Yeah, that time she knew I was coming.  I don't think she was happy about it or anything.  Yeah, because I had instructed.  I did as instructed.  She wasn't happy about it?  I told her, clear the bedroom of any fucking cum-stained sheets.  I'm coming over.  And yeah, and then we just went and ate in this stupid cafeteria thing there. 
[01:44:00]  Did you fuck her?  I don't...  No, I don't think that time.  No, it was over.  You think she was done with you?  Oh, fuck it.  It was so over.  Did you think she was done with you when you were on the train and buying a rose?  No.  I had an inkling, but I was sure that rose was just going to fucking bring everything back  together.  A single rose.  These fucking broads should have jumped in a time machine to find out what we would  become.  Exactly.  You motherfucker.  That was a goddamn catch. 
[01:44:30]  You fucking rot away with your husband and your dumb kids and fucking wherever the hell  you live now.  Pennsylvania.  Oh, God.  But when you...  Good for you.  When you have that realization and you're not ready to move on, but they are.  That was brutal growing up.  That is the worst feeling.  Those hits were fucking hard back then.  Now it's like if you're seeing a girl and you like her and then she fucking like blows  you off or something, it's just like what? 
[01:45:00]  Whatevs.  It's really just kind of like there's no emotional to you could cut that shit right  off.  Back then it was devastating.  Well, it's the innocence that you finally get over, I guess, but...  I don't think there was one girl that I talked to and then had any type of physical contact  with, like touch the shoulder or something, that I didn't immediately fall in love with.  Like love.  Like love.  What a dick bag.  And I didn't realize this.  It starts young. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  Because my son's three and a half.  Uh-oh.  And it's already happening to him.  He's attracted to this one girl in his classroom.  Is she white?  Yeah.  All right.  It's a girl.  Good.  She's actually the, probably, if I must say the hottest chick in his class.  There he goes.  There he goes.  He knows.  Well, what are you judging her on?  What makes her hot to you?  I must say.  I would say she's the hottest chick in his class. 
[01:46:00]  I think.  And he, you know, I hang out in the classroom a little bit because I don't really have a  life after this show.  So I'll hang for an hour here and there.  And he's working it, man.  And his little three and a half year old.  Yeah.  And I picked him up from school the other day and he made a treasure map.  And I go, what's the treasure map for?  And I go, well, it's for me and blah, blah.  It ends right in her box.  Goes starts at her ankles.  It goes to daddy's bank account. 
[01:46:30]  Exactly.  Right to her veg.  And then right to the next girl.  To everything, this treasure map was like probably the most amazing thing in his three  and a half year old brain.  To me, it was a lot of scribbles and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I go, oh, a treasure map for you and blah, blah.  And he goes, yeah.  I go, so how was it?  He goes, well, oh, no, we didn't get to play.  Why?  And in my head, I'm like, oh, my God, please don't tell me she blew him off in his treasure  map.  That means everything to his little brain. 
[01:47:00]  He was going to like what?  They were going on a little treasure exhibition?  He made this treasure map for him and her.  Right.  To go follow it and get a treasure?  In the classroom, whatever.  Some dumb thing.  And she, for whatever reason, didn't play with him.  Oh, that bitch.  And I, but I could see in his eyes and he's only three and a half, like the, it's a bit,  was a bit devastating to him.  Now you give him that good advice.  When the girls do that, you have to kill them.  Exactly.  Oh.  Exactly.  Make sure she's not treasure mapping with a, you know, what? 
[01:47:30]  That's all you need.  I wanted to pull her aside and go, tell me a fucking favor.  Yeah.  Come on.  Fucking play treasure fucking map with my kid.  But then you get older and you realize.  Oh, brutal.  How much time you spent being a sap was wasted that if you just hadn't been a sap.  Just don't be a sap.  How many girls you could have gotten just by not being a sap.  Crazy.  I wasted a bunch of years being a sap.  Me too.  For real, man.  For reals.  I love you.  For fucking girls.  My whole time in Buffalo.  That's sweet.  My whole, my whole time in Buffalo, I can officially say I was a sap. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  Nothing better than telling a girl you love her and then she goes, oh, that's sweet.  Oh, no.  Exactly.  Oh, no.  Ha, ha.  Ew.  Junior high and high school stunk on ice.  Yeah.  Oh, what a pain in the ass all that shit was.  One of the Buffalo stories, there was always the old boyfriend that was around that she  swear she wasn't still with and that fast forwarded to her when she got mad at me, decided to  leave messages of her having sex with her ex on my voicemail. 
[01:48:30]  Love that one.  Which I proceeded to play for her mom and her grandfather because those two people thought  she was like a fucking angel.  So I'm like, well, here's your angel daughter.  That's the short version of that story.  But there was another guy that was around and he ended up being on one of these home improvement  shows.  And when we were doing our, I think it was the virus tour.  Uh-huh.  Do you remember when the, I forgot what show it was, but it pulled up to the same hotel  as us with a giant fucking display on the side.  It's one of these home improvement where they go into a shithole and make it cool. 
[01:49:00]  And I'm like, holy fuck.  And it was the guy that I knew from Buffalo that was friends with my quote, because at  this point I don't believe she ever thought I was her boyfriend.  Quote, girlfriend.  And I remember one time going over to her house unexpectedly.  I'm like, oh, where is she?  Oh, maybe she's in the basement.  So I go down in the basement and she's on the fucking washing machine and he's extremely  close to her.  Oh, no.  Not naked, but extremely close.  And also I'm like, oh, hi, Greg. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, he's helping me move.  Oh, no.  And like a fucking sapper, I'm like, oh, okay.  Well, anyway, I'm here.  What do you want to do now?  It was so obvious.  Oh, so obvious.  When you use your older eyes to look back at some of this shit, you're like, oh, my God,  what a fucking sapper was.  But then I actually ran into him when, I think it was Worcester.  Didn't we play outside Worcester or something?  With Tracy Morgan, yes.  Okay.  And he was there.  I'm like, I forgot his name even, or we can look him up. 
[01:50:00]  Tim Allen?  Tim Allen.  And also I'm like, it was good to see the guy.  And I had to ask him.  I'm like, come on, dude, tell me.  And he's like, he admitted that he was with her the whole time.  I'm like, I figured.  Whatever.  Because now this is years.  I need to know how bad she looked nowadays.  He goes, oh, man, she's a big, fat pig.  My wife.  And then we start fucking laughing and kind of high-fiving, which was weird.  Because at the time, he was my fucking competition, I guess.  Jesus Christ.  But you know that whole look thing.  There was a girl, and I guess her family was hosting this kid from fucking England. 
[01:50:30]  Right.  Oh, Jesus.  Seriously?  I know.  How old was she?  16, 17?  Yeah, she was like 16.  Um, I was going out with her at the time.  And, uh, this kid from England comes up.  Comes up.  And, and they're, they're just all hanging out.  Like, smoking weed and ciggies and stuff.  And, and everything.  And then I'd come over, and we'd be hanging out. 
[01:51:00]  And, and you'd look over real quick.  And just see them, like, looking at each other.  Right.  Like, making eyes and stuff.  And then they'd look away real quick.  And it's like, maybe they're just, you know, pals.  Ugh.  Maybe, you know, there's probably an inside joke they told you earlier.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're just trying not to remember.  You don't want to believe, right?  Believe it.  Yeah, yeah.  Ugh.  That he's laying some uncircumcised English cock to her.  Fucking prick.  I think when I turned, I, I'll be honest.  I think when I turned 30 was when I was like, ugh. 
[01:51:30]  I wasn't a sap.  That was enough?  I think I was a sap well into my late 20s, though.  Yeah, definitely.  But then I absolutely knew I wasn't a sap anymore.  I was just like, ugh, just fucking keep your eyes open, you idiot.  Jesus.  Yeah, I, uh.  But I think I made it to 30 being a fucking sap.  28, 29, definitely.  I would build up like, like relationships in my head.  Oh, yeah.  That weren't even fucking there.  Oh, yeah.  Like there was a cute girl at school, and I have this whole thing, and I'd literally start  falling in love with a girl I never talked to. 
[01:52:00]  Right.  I never even fucking talked to her.  I used to write in my head in high school.  Oh, no.  I used to write love notes to girls that I didn't talk to in my head, but never actually  write them or give them to her.  Why would you?  Like, I just sit there up, staying up at night.  And you get all that.  And then I'm going to tell them that.  You get all that bad, that emotion, that heartbreak out of nothing.  Nothing.  She didn't even know you knew.  Nothing was there.  I had an amazing relationship with this girl in high school.  This is a true story, too.  You want to know what the relationship was? 
[01:52:30]  I would follow her home every day.  There you go.  From a distance.  Yeah.  It was the most amazing relationship.  To me, that was everything.  Like, it felt like it was a relationship because I was following her home.  Who was it?  Jodie Foster?  I know.  I know.  And then I'd see her in the hallway, and the heart would just go, oh.  Oh, and I thought she knew, like, that, you know.  Oh, she didn't know anything.  Of course.  Nothing.  I didn't give a shit.  I thought she was feeling exactly the same shit I was, but, you know, she was too scared 
[01:53:00]  of telling me as well.  So that's why just following her home was the greatest thing ever.  And I felt like maybe she knew I was following her home, and that was cool for her, because  she was too scared, too.  But, A, she had no fucking idea who I was.  B, she never knew I was fucking following her home.  You mean you didn't play Ozzy when you walked by her house and write a note that said, if  you want to know who I am, wear this?  And then they wore the scarf the next day, but you didn't tell them who you were? 
[01:53:30]  Then why'd you tell them to wear it?  Because I was mentally ill.  She did the same thing with him with a noose, wear this.  You walked by her house playing Ozzy?  Yeah, my friend Frank, and I went and slipped a note in her mailbox, and I was, uh...  Wish it was a suicide note.  I, uh...  Terrible.  I fucking, uh...  It's embarrassing.  Yeah, I'm very embarrassed by this part, because I kind of wanted her to know who I...  Because everybody knew that I loved Ozzy.  And so I wrote something in Spanish at the bottom of the letter, but it was the name 
[01:54:00]  of an Ozzy album in Spanish.  Oh.  Why?  Why in Spanish?  I don't know.  Oh, is that stupid?  You were poetic, didn't you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was very stupid.  This is fucking good.  This is...  There was a girl that was, uh, she looked like, uh, 16, or, uh, it might have been younger,  15-year-old, uh, Ann Romano.  And I was in love with her.  Ew.  Oh, she had a little perky red hair and stuff, and I just was, like, head over heels. 
[01:54:30]  This was in, uh, in, uh, like, junior high in California when I was out there.  And I remember, again, building up a relationship out of nothing.  There was nothing there.  I was in class with her, yeah, it was, like, Ann Romano, a girlfriend.  That's hilarious.  That never happened.  And I remember that song.  If you leave me now, take away the biggest part.  And when that would play, I would think of her, and think of how heartbreaking it would  be if she left me, but we were never together. 
[01:55:00]  What an asshole!  What an asshole!  Were you ever convinced that an older woman was attracted to you?  I hated older women.  Yes, I was.  No, no, I'm talking, when I was, uh, I would say 12-ish.  No.  So I didn't even have a real dick yet.  Uh, my, my uncle, my uncle, who's about 10 or 11 years older than me, I think that's  about right.  So he came around, he was in his early 20s, and he brought the, the fucking bikini broads 
[01:55:30]  around, because it was my grandma's beach house.  And one of the, one of the broads that came around just paid attention to me.  Oh.  Politely, now that I look at my older eyes back at the situation.  Yes.  I was convinced she was fucking in love with me.  Did you get a little boner?  All that shit.  Were you getting a little boner?  But I'm 12.  Yeah.  What would she fucking want from me?  Oh, man.  But in my dumb, still developing brain, I was convinced, because she gave me just a tiny  bit of attention, I started fast-forwarding that we, we would be boyfriend and girlfriend. 
[01:56:00]  She was 23 years old.  With a 12-year-old boy.  With a 12-year-old boy that still didn't have a real dick yet.  Not a hint of a muscle, even.  Nothing.  Do you know, I used to have the same thing on my paper route.  There was a woman who was older, and I got real vibes from her.  I thought, I would crank my dick to her, and I would replay every interaction.  12, 13?  I want to say 13, 12 in that area, but every interaction we had, her robe would always  be a little bit open.  I fucking, every day, would replay that moment and just crank it. 
[01:56:30]  Wow.  But here's the question.  Now that you're older, looking back, do you think there was actually something going on  with her?  Yeah, because we would talk for a lot.  She kind of liked to be a little bit of a tease, or she just didn't think twice that  her robe might have been open a little?  I think she thought it was a fun, flirty thing to do with the, nothing sexually.  Yeah, like she just thought it was fun.  With the boys from the neighborhood?  Yeah, just kind of cute to flirt with the 12 or 13 year old.  Nothing like she wanted to fuck me.  Wow.  Oh, I was convinced as my uncle's friend. 
[01:57:00]  Oh my God, how embarrassing.  It's always just embarrassing.  It's the worst.  What was it going to do?  Nothing.  I had a 10 speed bike.  Get on my bike.  Right.  We'll go ride somewhere.  When I was 16, a girl I had a crush on wrote Hi Sam in my notebook.  Oh, shit.  And I spent the next six months trying to figure out how I was going to take that note to I'm  asking you out on a date.  I never said a word to her after that.  Why would I?  Because at the beginning of the plot was, if you think I'm fucking you, you must be. 
[01:57:30]  Hi Sam.  Did I ever tell the caddy story?  That's so embarrassing.  So embarrassing.  The caddy story, I was a caddy for many years.  Caddy?  For people that don't know.  And every once in a while you'd have to caddy for their kids, which was so annoying.  They were the same age as you and they would be the biggest fucking pricks.  Yeah.  Because their parents had money.  But I caddy for this one couple's daughter who was my age and I was out of my mind. 
[01:58:00]  And like, oh, this girl is the hottest girl ever.  I could have been more than 14 maybe.  And then I had to clean her, you know, her bag at the end of the round.  And I was clean.  Colossum me?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  She had diverticulitis.  He had to scoop the feces out of her colossum.  I was convinced.  I was convinced because of one stupid round of golf where I had a caddy for her that, 
[01:58:30]  you know, she liked me as much as I was attracted to her.  Of course, that's nonsense.  And I never talked to her again.  But as I was cleaning her bag, I'm like, I wonder what's in here.  And I think I told a story before.  And I found a tampon.  It drove me insane.  Just because you know where it went.  And I took a trophy.  I took it with me.  Wow.  You stole a tampon?  You used to stalk girls and steal their tampons?  What a fucking creep.  Oh, wow.  Creep.  That's a good one.  I'm 14.  I don't care. 
[01:59:00]  All that shit is just fucking, like...  What a creep.  I don't remember what...  I brought it home and I felt like I had some weird connection with her.  Did you make a hair doll?  Of course you did.  Yeah.  Did you put your foot up on the toilet like the instructions and shove it up your asshole?  I would have deserved that at that point.  What a loser.  That was yanking material as a kid.  The instructions on the back of a tampon box.  But there was something about, like, this is hers, and I don't know, man. 
[01:59:30]  The intimacy of it.  It goes in her pussy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which I couldn't even...  Crazy.  Even at, like, 14, I was still...  Oh.  Mine was blown by, you know, pussy.  It's proof of her vagina.  I guess.  Yes, it exists.  I don't even need a stupid psychologist calling it.  I don't need to know what that means.  I just know I was fucking out of my mind with hormones.  We lived next door to two really sexy teenage girls.  I was probably 12, and they would dry their underwear on the line.  It's the only time I ever...  I'm not really into...  I stole a pair of satin panties. 
[02:00:00]  Oh.  And I fucking cranked.  And they had been dried and washed.  Oh, my God.  I cranked.  I would wrap those around my dick and jerk off for a fucking couple of years that got me.  You'd wrap them around your dick.  That soft, satiny panty.  I cranked that on my prick for years.  Oh, my God.  Maybe two years.  I kept it in a box.  Like, I didn't know what to do with this.  You never cleaned it?  No, I didn't come on it.  There was no loads on it.  Oh, no loads on it.  That's disgusting.  You're still getting fucking pre. 
[02:00:30]  Here comes the pre.  So, anyway.  Just smelled like sweaty dick all the time?  Yeah.  No, I would just rub it.  I could put it on my face and dream of their asses.  I liked the panty drawer every so often.  And I remember being on a few jobs and poking and looking in a few panty drawers.  Just looking.  You ever see that one that looks like a fucking, the bottom of a Band-Aid when it's pulled off?  The one that's got a rag panties.  The rag panties are great.  Fucking yuck.  I love the rag panties. 
[02:01:00]  Good old rag panties.  And then the dirty ones, too, in the hamper.  Oh, that's kind of cool.  You look in there and just see some fucking, uh...  Yeah.  You ever smell like a little ass part of it?  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  You're not fucking looking at it.  With that stupid, like, why is that white fucking material in there to show a world of hurt?  That's probably so, you know, she knows what a fucking disaster she has.  Why don't we get back to Alan and Kierley?  Yes.  I guess the point is, uh, the reason I like this show is because I just understand being a sap. 
[02:01:30]  I think most guys have...  I think now we all know.  You think women are saps, too?  When they're figuring it all out?  When they're younger?  They have a little more power over...  I think they do have a little high power.  Women tend to be more saps later.  Yeah, maybe that's...  Because they're convinced they're going to get married.  They're convinced they're going to have kids.  Very good.  And once guys figure it out, then the women become saps.  Right.  Once we give up.  Yeah.  Yes.  Like, who give up?  Keith in Milwaukee has to pay closer attention.  He writes, which one of you wrote a note with a check-if-you-love-me box? 
[02:02:00]  Oh.  Wasn't that you?  I think that was Jimmy.  It was check...  Or, no, it was check here.  It was something else.  It wasn't if you love me.  It was something about if you notice me or like me.  Oh, yeah.  Do you like me, too?  Check.  Yeah, I did that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You'd always give girls an option.  Yeah, you know, you could fucking kiss me or throw yourself into the sticker, Bush.  Yeah, that was Julie, her name was.  I remember one girl, Sandy, I used to talk to on the phone. 
[02:02:30]  And this is why I'm a stand-up.  Because I would fucking just read out of Blanche Knotts.  Remember Blanche Knotts would have those Polish jokes, black jokes?  I really don't know.  She was a very, very famous, truly tasteless joke.  Oh, yeah.  And there was a bunch of them.  There was like, you know, some of them were gripped.  They would be broken up into sections, or they'd be all Polish jokes.  And I would just sit on the phone for hours and just read her jokes.  And she would either laugh or not laugh.  I remember how personally I took it when she wouldn't laugh.  Oh, wow.  I used to love making her laugh.  Oh, but over the phone?  Yeah.  That's good.  Yeah. 
[02:03:00]  Jimmy phoning it in.  Yeah.  Phoning in his material.  It's always better at phoners then than I am now.  Well, Kirliam and Alan from 90 Day Fiance.  So now, oh, it started with the Kirliam is not answering her phone.  That was about an hour ago.  Right.  So she's at her shoot.  So that reminded me of some, yeah.  All right.  I got it.  So now she's getting her shots done.  Yeah, she said that she's getting her photos taken, but Alan's calling her.  This guy's so insecure that he doesn't understand that she's not answering her phone because 
[02:03:30]  she's in the middle of fucking getting her modeling shots done.  Yes.  I tried to call Kirliam at the photo shoot, and she didn't pick up.  I was a little worried.  Oh.  Dang.  I hope everything is going well, being a supermodel, I guess.  The wife's male is leaving.  Love you.  Oh.  Bye.  A million things running through my head, and one of them were positive. 
[02:04:00]  Like a thing's falling off your head, your hair.  Poor fuck.  Don't mind me.  Don't mind me.  It's him walking into the shoot.  When he showed up at the shoot.  Because she wasn't answering her phone, he walked into the shoot.  Yeah, he showed up while she's taking it.  Oh, my God.  This is not going to play out well.  That's not good.  I support him.  Yeah, but when women smell that shit, they're done.  Possessiveness.  They're done when they smell that insecurity crap. 
[02:04:30]  I'm absolutely blown away by how stunning Kirliam is.  But seeing a room full of people staring at her, most of them men, it's a little hard to stomach.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  You dumb Mormon fuck.  Yeah, really?  You are so sunk.  This guy, we're running out of show, but this guy, go ahead, Tim in Jersey.  We should have went to the phones.  Everyone had a fucking story.  Tim in.  Everyone had a story.  Listen, this is fucking embarrassing, but I figured if I'm going to tell somebody, I'll 
[02:05:00]  tell you guys.  So, this is a girl.  I have four sisters, two older, two younger.  And this one girl, Yvonne, used to come over and hang out with one of my older sisters  all the time.  She'd leave her purse in the bathroom, right?  So, one day, I'm going through her purse in the bathroom looking for anything to get,  you know, my raging heart on so I can whack off thinking about her in the next room.  And I find a tampon, right?  And it's like, the top's open, like the plastic's open, but it was one of the newer ones, like 
[02:05:30]  in the plastic sleeve, you know?  Yeah.  So, I took it out, and I pushed it out a little bit, and I jerked off on it.  And I put it back in the sleeve, and I put it back in the plastic.  Oh, man.  That's very antisocial.  That is antisocial.  So, when she used to call the house, like, I'd get her on the phone and get her to talk  to me, like, to ask her for some advice, and I'd go in the bathroom and jerk off, but 
[02:06:00]  you've got to do it really quietly, because you don't want her to know.  Like, you hear her, she hears you're breathing heavy.  She's going to know if something's up.  So, you've got to be real quiet when you smack anyone at her on the phone.  I'm like, can you tell me why I don't get big grades in school?  Oh, so he's just hearing her voice, and you'd be jacking it.  That is some really...  Yeah, I just listen to her talk, and I say, what was that?  Antisocial behavior.  Absolutely.  You know, I was, like, psychotic.  So, now I just kill puppies.  Yeah.  No.  She actually ended up being, like, they all turned out to be fucking fat and disgusting, 
[02:06:30]  and married some ex-welder.  I love that.  You know, that, you know...  Well, you also said you were hoping she would get pregnant so you guys would fall in love.  Oh.  Yeah, absolutely.  I wanted her to get pregnant, so she...  With the tampon thing.  She fall in love with me, because I was 11.  Oh, you were 11, bro.  I was going to be married and have kids by the time I was 12.  Exactly.  I was such a fucking man.  She's not shoving a tampon in her when she's ovulating, sir. 
[02:07:00]  I know.  I'm 11.  But it's 11.  Of course, you don't know all that shit.  Yeah, I knew that, though.  You did?  Sure.  Yeah, I knew I couldn't arch seeds on a tampon and shove it in the cut and get her pregnant.  Oh, no, I know that, but I mean...  Yeah, all right.  Fair enough.  Do you know those 976 numbers?  Yes.  I...  When they first came out, I first got wind of that from my older brother, because he  used to call it and put me on the phone once and thought it was funny.  One month, I would...  You know, it's like 60 seconds or 45 seconds for like $3.  Yeah.  I'd call it, I'd go jerk off, come back out, call it again, go jerk off, come back, call 
[02:07:30]  it again.  My father gets the phone bill.  Now, he's a cop, right, for like 30 years, right?  A tough guy, right?  He gets the phone bill.  It's like $1,300.  You know, back in like 1982.  That's a lot of fucking money, man.  It's huge.  Jesus.  He's like, what the fuck is this?  And I blamed it on my brother.  He got his ass beat.  You're a psychotic, man. 
[02:08:00]  I was such a fucking asshole, man.  But hey, listen.  As many times as I spurged on fucking anything I could find, it always was her face.  Wow.  You know, I joined one of those 900 numbers when they first came out.  I had to send a money order to California.  I had to go and look at $90 for a month.  You get a month and they get a code with it.  So for a month, you could call up Unlimited and jerk off with these live girls.  How was it?  It was live girls or was it just a recording? 
[02:08:30]  It was live girls.  All right, sir.  And I got it.  You just had your say.  And I called.  Exactly.  Thanks, sir.  You interviewed me for this podcast.  Right.  Thanks, sir.  I got a, I got a, I called, the minute I got it, I called up to talk and I guess it was  like fucking nine in the morning or whatever here.  And then it was so early there.  Yeah.  So I called it and the woman answered and she's like, hello.  And I'm like, hi.  She's like, yeah.  I'm like, well, you know, I got the number.  And she's like, you want to talk about that now? 
[02:09:00]  Yes.  You fuck.  Yeah.  And she did.  And I fucking jerked off.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  I remember those lines.  Yeah.  Was she into it?  No.  Not at all.  She would have been more turned on telling me how to put a transmission in.  Back to Curlyum.  She likes modeling.  Alan is more concerned here.  He's panicking.  Oh yes.  What'd you think?  It was good.  Okay.  Could you, could you do that?  Every day?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like it.  I tried to call you. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, I'm so sorry.  Were you, were you in the middle of shooting or makeup or something like that?  Makeup in there.  Oh, you were doing makeup?  Makeup.  Yeah.  What?  Yeah.  You look too pretty when you model.  Too pretty.  Thank you.  You look too pretty.  Thank you.  I don't like it.  I don't like it.  Promise you won't get sucked up?  Oh.  Why are you asking?  You won't leave me?  No.  Oh.  Let's just go.  Ah.  Okay.  And that's a visual.  We're not watching it today. 
[02:10:00]  We just got the audio clips, but.  Whoa.  Her eyes are like, that was her, that was her brain going.  Enough.  What?  Totally.  The best way to guarantee that somebody's going to leave you.  Say, don't leave me.  Say, please don't leave me.  Don't leave me.  Don't leave me.  Nah, she's not going anywhere.  She's a good girl.  Some guy here, I think it was on Pal Talk, said that in high school, he was literally begging  a girl not to break up with him.  And he thinks of it now and just cringes.  Yeah.  Like, you still get that visceral. 
[02:10:30]  Of course.  Like, horrible feeling.  Because he was probably in the middle of there going, don't leave me.  Crying.  That's embarrassing.  Did you ever cry around a girl in high school?  Oh, yeah.  I've done that in adulthood.  That's terrible.  No.  You used to cry a lot.  Oh, ew.  No.  Yeah.  That, I could absolutely say it.  Oh, yeah.  Thinking it would be a sympathy angle or something.  I do that watching, if I'm watching TV or a movie now, it's hard not to drop a few. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, Jesus, you fruit.  All right.  Well, there's a line somewhere between I cry too much and you, on the other hand.  I would.  Probably his opposite extremes.  Old Death Valley eyes.  Exactly.  I wouldn't cry in front of them, but as soon as I was, you know, they were gone, I would  put on R.E.M.  Everybody hurts.  Sometimes.  Sometimes.  Everybody.  Everybody. 
[02:11:30]  Bitches.  You fucking bitches.  That's the bitches.  That is.  I don't even know what the fuck it was like.  They destroy us.  Some high school bullshit.  Not me, they didn't.  I just fucked them and forgot them.  Yeah.  Didn't fuck anyone.  Stuck it right in there.  It's the four Fs.  Yeah.  Find them, feel them, fuck them, and forget them.  Yeah, then finger them.  Oh, find them, finger them.  Wait.  Find them, finger them, fuck them, fart on them, forget them.  You ever have the girl that comes back? 
[02:12:00]  What?  And then you're just so not into it anymore?  No.  Oh, but you'll fuck her.  Never happened.  Really?  No.  I would have been right back into her again.  Once a girl has gone, they're like fucking convicts and gotten out.  They never show back.  They never come back.  I had a girl come back, and then she's like, isn't this great?  We're back together and stuff.  I'm like, I just didn't feel the same.  I was like, gosh.  Yeah.  It was over.  That was the one where I found the giant sneakers in the trunk.  I told that story, too, right?  That's not good.  I decided to stay back and start my radio career while everyone decides to move to Boston 
[02:12:30]  and have an amazing fucking social life.  And we would go there a lot, and we looked like the idiots coming from cold Rochester  where nothing's happening for a 23, 24-year-old.  And they're in Boston.  They had millions of opportunities to just have a good fucking time always.  And my girlfriend, we were together a good year, a year and a half at this point.  That's a full relationship back then.  She decided she wanted to go with the Boston gang, and I was like, fuck, man. 
[02:13:00]  But you're too young to make it official and stuff.  You're like, shit, we're just out of college, and you're going to do this.  But you can't tell her not to.  But she moved to actually Cape Cod.  And just like the other one, it was tough to get her to commit to me going there.  And it finally happened.  She's like, all right, all right.  I'm like, I'm in Boston.  I went to Boston for New Year's.  I'm like, hey.  But I didn't want to be in Boston for New Year's.  I wanted to be with her, but I used the excuse, I'm in Boston New Year's. 
[02:13:30]  But I actually went to Boston with the hope that I would run to her.  And so I drive all the way to Cape Cod from Boston.  You know what that ride is?  And she picks me up.  No, I didn't drive because she picked me up.  So how the fuck did I get there?  A train, probably.  I don't know if there's a train that goes to get you.  Is there a helicopter?  Walking?  Submarine.  Is there a yak ride?  Might have been a...  Rickshaw?  Honestly, it might have been a bus or something.  Oh, God.  No, because she absolutely didn't...  I did not drive.  And she picks me up wherever the fuck I went to. 
[02:14:00]  Maybe a train.  I don't remember.  Fuck.  And she opens a trunk for me to put my bag in for this.  I'm going to be out there for a night.  And there's giant, I mean, giant basketball sneakers in her trunk.  Oh, that's...  And I'm just like, oh.  And at that moment, everything made sense.  I'm like, oh, crap.  You didn't ask her that?  Who's giant footwear is that?  I do believe at the time I did.  And she was like, you know, whatever.  Oh.  And we had a good time. 
[02:14:30]  And then I was just like, oh, that's over, obviously.  Because as soon as I leave, giant basketball sneaker guys coming around again.  Yep.  And I'm like, I ain't sharing a dude with my chick.  You said that wrong.  I ain't sharing a chick with you.  I ain't sharing a dude.  Absolutely.  Why should you?  Nice.  Good for you.  Good for yourself.  No reason to have to share with that man.  That's your dude.  Absolutely.  She just should have stanked that beautiful cock up.  Great.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, I ain't sharing a fucking chick with a fucking, no, whatever. 
[02:15:00]  I get it.  I get it.  I can't cover that.  Exactly.  No, we understand.  But then I move on to Buffalo, and she came to see me.  Because now she's back in Rochester.  The K-Cod Boston thing didn't work out.  And she came and saw me, and she was excited.  She was done with that guy or whatever.  And she hung out.  We had a good time.  But there was just something that wasn't right.  And that was it.  Stretch that vagina.  That was it.  And stretched up vag.  Yeah, maybe it was her fucking Pistons tattoo and the giant pussy. 
[02:15:30]  Weird way I felt bad.  I'm like, I want to say you ruined this, because I felt bad.  Because I'm like, she was excited.  Like, all right, I had to figure some shit out.  And no, I really want to be with you.  And I'm like, man, that's fucking, I'm done.  And I just knew.  I didn't hate her or anything.  But I was just like, yeah, this isn't the fucking thing.  There was just the thought of a girl with another guy.  That was the worst feeling ever.  I don't even think through memories I can conjure up the type of anger and helplessness and despair that that feeling was back then. 
[02:16:00]  Like, you can't even conjure it up anymore.  No.  But it was horrible.  It was.  Because you were, you know, in love.  You're like, but that should be me.  And then you're picturing her with another guy.  It was the worst thing ever.  Yeah, my, when I was in Syracuse, my girlfriend ended up hooking up back in Westchester with another guy whose name was Sam. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  And it drove me to the brink of insanity for months.  Of course.  Yeah.  Yeah, then you finally get over it.  Then you get over it.  You're better for it.  You realize you wasted a shitload of days being sad about it.  Like, ugh.  And too much time in the relationship.  The second you fucking have a conversation with another girl and maybe touch her shoulder, it's over.  Right.  And it's like, fuck that other guy.  I don't even know her name.  But unfortunately, that took some time back then.  Yes, it did.  So, Alan is wondering if Kirlium really likes to model.  Natasha called me today. 
[02:17:00]  What'd she say?  She say I am good.  Oh, okay.  So she liked your photos.  Yeah.  And she's like, she's already sending them out?  When I heard the agents want to book me, I was like, whoa, that's a big deal.  And maybe this could be a career.  A career?  How do you feel about that?  Yeah.  Yeah, I like it.  Sure?  Sure.  What?  Oh, boy.  Yeah. 
[02:17:30]  Because it's possible that might happen again that I have to work and you have to go to a shoot.  Are you going to be okay?  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, you like the experience overall, right?  Yeah, of course.  Oh, my hair's so pretty.  Oh, my hair's so pretty.  And yours is so falling out.  He's trying to be cool about it.  Yeah.  He's like, fuck that.  He knows this is the end.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He knows this is the end.  He's saying the beginning of the end right there.  But there's so much desperation. 
[02:18:00]  Like, he's trying to fake it.  So desperate.  He can't.  He can't.  Well, he can.  He can fake it to her because her English isn't that great.  But she's picking up a little.  Right.  A little.  Yeah.  But not to the extent it actually is, is what you're saying.  Yeah.  Like, she can't pick up on the subtleties.  But when he's in a parking lot, he's saying, you won't leave me, will you?  Oh, yeah.  And she wrote.  She kind of.  Her eyes didn't roll, but she did this kind of like.  Yeah.  Wow.  And then, you know how many of the other girls and people around the shoots.  It's like, you know, when he walks in or he drops her off.  And she's like, that is my boyfriend. 
[02:18:30]  That's my fiance.  And they'll be like, that guy?  Yeah.  And then they just start talking shit about.  Really?  Right.  No, I'm sure he's very nice.  He said, it just doesn't look like the kind of guy that would be with you.  Right.  Oh, and just undermining.  Well, it ends with this final clip.  He's panicking to the point this happened.  Panicking.  This is my best, my favorite moment on 90 Day Fiance so far.  I love the innocence about Caroleon.  I don't want anyone to take advantage. 
[02:19:00]  It was just kind of weird for me walking in and there was just a bunch of people, a bunch  of guys, dudes looking at you.  Man, look, guys, we are professionals.  Yeah, I know, but professionals.  Jealousy.  No, I'm not jealous.  Just be careful.  Let's go.  I hate saying goodbye.  Man, me too.  Like every night.  Oh, this is where he now leaves his model girlfriend.  She's officially now a model girlfriend at his parents' house so she could sleep on 
[02:19:30]  the pullout.  What the fuck is wrong with this?  I think you've got to throw your religion away.  Right?  Your religion's got to go out the fucking window.  Oh, yeah.  It hurts too much.  This 90 days will not work.  I mean, don't you feel that way too?  Of course.  Uh-huh.  When Alan asked me if I want to marry with him, I don't see like an emergency. 
[02:20:00]  Emergency?  We have to marry now, but I am excited and I'm here to marry with him.  So.  So.  No 90 days.  As soon as possible.  Okay.  Oh, God.  I didn't really have to start planning.  It's going to be pretty crazy.  Because he's such an idiot.  He's going to say, all right, if I just get her married, then whatever she's thinking in  her head will go away.  It doesn't fucking matter.  Imaginary things that she's thinking in her head because she's not even thinking any of 
[02:20:30]  that stuff yet.  Done.  Not only is she going to leave him, but she's going to get all of his shit, too.  She's going to get half of his mom's Sloppy Joes.  Yeah.  Right.  Sloppy Joes.  Oh, that's great.  What an idiot.  There you go.  That true buffoon.  The Opie and Anthony show has drawn to a close.

You know, I don't know about you, but I don't like taking pills for minor arthritis pain, and I really don't like those patches either.  But I have found something that works, Australian Dream.

The stories behind the stories.  Behind the stories.  The backstage drama.  Everything that made today unforgettable.  Call 866-WOW-1-WOW now. 
[02:30:00]  And look back on another legendary day of broadcasting.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Post Show.  With Sam Roberts.  That's right.  Call up now.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  And let's rap about what we just heard.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Post Show.  Another fabulous O.P. and Anthony Show.  Great show today.  As much free advertising and as many viewers as we're giving the show 90 Day Fiancee, it cannot be understated how much content that show is giving to us. 
[02:30:30]  Like every week now, we're doing great radio because of that show.  Not only because we get to exploit everything the show is doing, but it's bringing up, I mean, the whole, hearing O.P., Anthony, and Jim talk about times when they were saps growing up was some of the best radio you'll ever hear. 
[02:31:00]  Because these are guys who you kind of, they've kind of come into themselves.  They're confident.  They're successful now.  I mean, Anthony, he's got another one of these broads every other week.  Like, it's so refreshing to hear that there was a time where, just like you and me, they were struggling.  E-Rock, we got line of the day?  I will in one second.  Who are you on the phone with?  With Travis.  I will in one second, he says.  We're trying to pick up the pace. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  Let's go.  I was getting it together.  What were you getting together?  The line of the day.  I didn't know which one it was.  I got it now.  Oh, my God.  You see what I have to deal with here?  Eric, what's the line of the day?  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  We had a good time. 
[02:32:00]  And then I was just like, oh, that's over, obviously.  Because as soon as I leave, giant basketball sneaker guy's coming around again.  Yep.  I'm like, I ain't sharing a dude with my chick.  You said that wrong.  I ain't sharing a chick.  Jesus Christ.  Why should you?  You gave Opie line of the day on that?  It was funny.  I guess it was.  You never know.  You got to be on your toes here on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:32:30]  Of course, that was during that last segment.  Let's go to Aaron in Detroit here on the post show.  Welcome, Aaron.  It might be Adam.  I don't know if you got my name right.  Adam is your name.  Yes, sir.  Sammy, how you doing?  Good.  Let me share my staff story with you.  When I was a cocksucker in high school, I fell in love with this girl that she kind of  talked to me.  I would call her house.  Listen, maybe the cooler guys that had cars would take her home from school, sometimes  would answer the phone, and I would think, oh, well, you're just giving them a ride home. 
[02:33:00]  Well, I didn't really have that cool thing going on.  I was in ninth grade.  My brother was a senior in high school.  So that summer, we were hanging out with him.  We were smoking weed.  We were being cool.  I thought I was cool.  Well, there was no girls around.  And they were like, man, there's no girls.  I said, dude, I can know a couple girls.  Let me give them a call.  So I called her up.  She says, cool, party, yeah, beers, weed.  Story's too long.  Story's too long.  It didn't hold my attention, buddy. 
[02:33:30]  Next time.  Next time.  And apparently from our call screen, he's saying that's not really what he was saying.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know.  It was way too long, though.  I can't handle it.  But it was refreshing.  I mean, for me, I don't feel like I came into my own and was confident enough to feel comfortable in the way I spoke to women until after I already met the chick I ended up marrying.  It was a total waste.  Total waste of time.  You just think back, and you're like, if I could go back to my late teens, early 20s with the knowledge and confidence that I have today, I could clean up. 
[02:34:00]  But Dennis Falcone just walked in.  Same way.  You're exactly right.  I mean, I was like the class clown.  I could get up on stage and dance and do the twist, but I couldn't look a girl straight in the eye.  You wouldn't want to go out to a movie.  No, she just thinks I'm a goofball.  She doesn't take me seriously.  I don't think so.  But you go back to your high school reunion.  Women are going to be lining up to talk to you.  You think so?  Without a doubt.  Yeah, look at the fucking ring on my finger now. 
[02:34:30]  I blew it, Dennis.  You could slide that thing right off.  Is that what you do?  You could slide that thing right off.  Not bad.  Not bad, Dennis.  How did you think the Super Show went on Friday for you?  You were here.  You were DJing the whole show.  You got to have a first look at Bobo and his naked twister and the lap dances that Stalker  Patty and Mike Buschetti got.  It was a miniseries all in one.  It was, wasn't it?  There was just so much going on.  That's what the O.B. and Anthony Show does.  Instead of like, because you're a radio guy, so you must have looked at everything that 
[02:35:00]  was going on on that Super Show and think, boys, boys, what if we stretch this out a little  bit?  It was everything.  I thought you could have gone for eight hours.  Yeah, easily.  Exactly.  We could have done a week of shows in that one.  That's not what we do here.  They can't wait to do the next one.  No, they can't.  April 1st.  April 1st.  Do it April 1st.  Well, when the audience wants something, we got to give it to them.  And when your girl wants something, you got to give it to her.  And you got to know what the number one gift is for Valentine's Day.  What is it?  It's not a carpet sweeper.  No, it's not a carpet sweeper.

Do it now.  Save yourself a lot.  Let's go to Jimmy in Utah.  Hey, what's up, Sam?  How you doing?  Here's my take on 90-day shlobo, and that is that he's going to fuck this girl. 
[02:37:00]  He's going to put a baby up in her.  Yeah.  And then when she leaves him for the big black basketball star, he sues her for her future earnings.  Sound familiar?  So you're saying you do it in reverse because now the girl is ending up with this basketball player,  so she's going to be receiving money, and you're entitled to some of that because you brought her to America.  And he's not that smart, but is that not a good idea? 
[02:37:30]  Jimmy, if everybody were as smart as you and I, there'd be a lot less heartbroken men out there, wouldn't there be?  There you go, Sammy.  What time is it?  It's 49 after the hour.  We don't do that on the post-show.  That's a pre-show exclusive.  And you know what else is dumb about that?  If he knocks her up, she has a kid, and then she leaves him for a basketball player?  Mm-hmm.  Most courts usually will still favor the female, so he'll wind up having to pay for the kid while she's being taken care of with the basketball player.  He'll pay child support for his kid while whoever the 2014 version of Dennis Rodman is just ruining that young, innocent Brazilian that he brought over here. 
[02:38:00]  Eric, did you have a clip of the day today?  I did.  Let me hear it.  Uh, here it is.  Well, I've put in mind some Jolly Ranchers.  Exactly.  Twizzlers.  What is that?  A fucking, a used tampon.  That is really blood red.  A pulpy tampon.  Obviously, his booster's Jelly Donuts. 
[02:38:30]  Look how red yours is.  It really is red.  What is that?  Did you go overboard with the greens today?  No, this is the first time I'm trying to dress a beat.  This is beets, yeah.  What else?  I hate eating beets, but I'll put beets in a juice any day.  A good beet salad, home run.  I hate eating beets.  I love a good beet.  I'll drink a good beet, though.  I think there's kale in it, too, but it's mostly, it's beet, a little bit of fruit.  What kind of fruit?  I don't remember.  I gotta look in the, we made it last night, but it's in the book.  Is there a booster in yours?  No, no booster. 
[02:39:00]  You gotta go with the boost.  You gotta have a boost.  Wait, how do you make this shit?  What, is this like a fucking regular blender?  No.  No, it's a magic bullet.  The blender is pretty much this piece with the blades, so you can clean it much easier instead  of digging all the way in to try to clean blades.  It's a blender upside down.  It's amazing.  What, did you just take that clip because it was about you?  And how great the magic bullet is.  You just want to just get some plugging in.  Well, no, not necessarily.  It was also that I love how, you know, Jim has lost so much weight, and he comes off like 
[02:39:30]  he's Jack LaLanne, but then anytime something else comes up, he doesn't know what any kind  of health or diet stuff is.  That's a great point, because I picked up my, because we were all talking about, we're  all a bunch of women on this show.  It used to be just a locker room full of guys talking about chicks.  Now it's a bunch of men in a spa talking about their smoothies.  But I was like, I've got kale, banana, strawberry, and orange.  Nice.  And Jim goes, all right, yeah, that's all sugar.  You can't be drinking that.  That's all sugar.  But he also goes to the gym, too. 
[02:40:00]  He also works out.  He does.  You have to do both.  Do you go to a gym, Eric?  No, I do it at home.  Would you have predicted that was the answer?  If he has a good gym at home.  Well, I think you need the motivation.  Would you have predicted that Eric does or doesn't?  You would have predicted that.  You saw that coming a mile away.  I love the guy, but I know.  He's not going to.  I'm not going to a gym either.  I just use it as a hanger for my clothes and all those things at home.  Yeah.  You just put all your clothes over the treadmill or whatever.  It's a drying rack.  Yeah.  It's a drying rack. 
[02:40:30]  Well, Eric, how was your beet juice?  Did you finish it?  I've got to eat it once the show's done.  That's meal two.  Ugh.  Sounds gross.  Yeah.  It's beets.  It's blueberries.  I think there's some kale in it.  There's a little bit of honey, flax seeds in there.  You've got to put the flax seeds to help the digestion.  Is that right?  To help your shit.  That's right.  Friday, a week from Friday, is going to be the big conclusion of the EROC rolling bet.  That's why Eric's been drinking all these juices and stuff.  Are you feeling confident? 
[02:41:00]  I'm feeling hungry.  Put some Twizzlers in there.  I like Twizzlers.  Well, Ann said that earlier.  You're too hungry and confident.  You're too hungry and cranky to feel confident.  Yeah.  I just want it over with.  How does the beet juice thing taste?  I had a little bit of it.  I tried it after we did that segment.  Yeah?  It smells like lawn clippings.  Ugh.  Like if you ever mowed a lawn and then took the bag off the lawnmower and smelt the bag,  that's what it is.  I know you're supposed to do mainly vegetables, but you could put some fruit in there and make 
[02:41:30]  something tasty.  Some of them you have to because you can't just do beets and kale straight up.  How could you?  You need to throw in some like pineapple or lemon.  Well, that's what Jimmy was saying because that's all sugar.  This thing that comes with this blender, it says 50% leafy greens, 50% fruit.  Jim will drink a bottle of Diet Coke or Diet Dr. Pepper and that's the same thing.  It's way worse.  It's way worse.  You could have all the fruit you want and it's better than drinking Diet Dr. Pepper.  Well, on the Shred Diet, he says you could have like one Diet Soda. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, but I've skipped that.  I don't even do it.  I've been a month and a half without soda and doing really well with it.  I've got to tell you, Roland has told me off the air he's feeling really confident.  I don't know what diet he's doing.  I can tell you how he feels confident.  Why?  Because he's wearing pants again.  He hadn't worn jeans and regular pants in so long.  It was just shorts and track suits.  I mean, I was hanging out with him over the weekend and we were at a bar that had delicious pretzels.  Roland stayed away from the pretzels. 
[02:42:30]  Good for him.  There's an ice cream spot right around.  He lives in Brooklyn now and there's like a hipster ice cream spot that makes delicious ice creams.  Right around the corner from his apartment, he stays away from it.  Me and my wife got ice cream.  He didn't get any.  My wife and I.  You're right, Dennis.  I've got to be a little better about that, don't I?  That's good.  No, he's got great willpower, though.  He's doing a good job with it.  Let me tell you something.  Dennis, you've got to get an exciting treat for the woman in your life, don't you?  Yes, we do.  You do.  Specifically, you do.  And guys, if you want to be like Dennis, you've got to know Valentine's Day is this Friday.

[02:49:30]  I was driving through the South once before a satellite radio when you drove around the country.  Oh, you had to change the...  You had to actually take in the local...  The cultures...  Yes!  The local asshole.  I was just listening to you guys and 70s hits from fucking coast to coast.  I listened to...  You know, you get to like Missouri or Mississippi or wherever it is, and you go, I got one channel.  Yeah.  And it's the fucking preacher.  Right.  And so I'm listening to this Christian radio, I think I was in Missouri, and they had a 
[02:50:00]  show, it was late at night, a talk show, and they said, we're going to talk about our single  friends.  You know, we're all in families because we're God's children and because we're Christians,  but what about your single friends?  You love your single friends.  They're part of your family.  You know, some people, they just end up single and they're not going to change.  They're not going to have kids.  How do we make them part of the picture?  It was actually a really interesting call.  So the people start calling in.  We have a friend who's single and he's with us every Christmas. 
[02:50:30]  We treasure him.  He's a big part of our lives.  Then guys start calling in.  I'm single.  Yeah, of course.  And I love the families that I'm part of.  I'm the uncle.  And I realized in the South, single means gay.  It means gay.  It's a polite, in the really Christian South, people that grow up gay, they just call, you're  single.  Yeah.  I know.  Because you'd be married because that's what you do.  Yeah.  If you're in that heavy religious area. 
[02:51:00]  And single would be gay.  And they don't want to acknowledge that they're just gay.  That's hilarious.  You're not in a family.  What about the single?  We're close-minded assholes.  Single.  And they are.  The story was, really, what do you do with your gay friends?  Yeah, you just ostracize them.  I mean, they're not doing what they're supposed to do, but we still, you know them and you  love them.  What do you do about it?  Well, you have them over for Thanksgiving, you know.  I love being single.  Then back to exile.  And allow them to bring their friend over, right?  He's got other single friends. 
[02:51:30]  His single friend.  He's bringing his friend over today.  His friend.  His single friend.  And he's sucking his single penis.  That is a whole nother world down South like that.  Because, yeah, not very tolerant of things like that.  There are some Southern gays who end up here.  Yeah.  Or find a center of gayness to be part of.  Yes.  But then there's other ones who just stay in the South, and they stay embedded in that 
[02:52:00]  culture.  It's just odd that you're...  They're called single.  They don't know.  And at some point, they start living with the guy, and they just...  That's John and Mark.  They live together.  Yeah, they're roomies.  Yeah, roomies.  It is.  They're, uh...  Yeah, we did a story years ago about those two guys that were old guys.  Elmer and...  Yeah, yeah.  It was Elmer and some other...  And they were celebrating, like, how long they had been together.  And we...  Because it was like 60 years or something.  Elmer and Gus.  Elmer and Gus.  The longest...  Yeah, they...  They had just been together forever. 
[02:52:30]  The oldest gay couple in New York or something.  Yeah, it was crazy.  They had some kind of distinction.  But we had to think back that, like, it must have been so difficult.  And they actually met during the war or some shit.  In the 40s.  And we're, like, thinking, you know, they come back and they're profiled on some newsreel  where it's like, look at these two fellas, ladies.  They're here looking for...  They're available.  Fresh back from the war.  They're available.  Yes, they live together.  You could double date with a couple of these ladies. 
[02:53:00]  Look at this.  Yes, eligible bachelors.  And, like, just completely not knowing.  They're just ass-fucking every night and loving it.  Well, I think they're...  Saving money on the water bill.  By showering together.  Very economical.  Stuff they must have learned in the military.  Yes.  They bought a nice little house together in Levittown.  He puts his penis in his anus.  In the 40s. 
[02:53:30]  Yes.  Come on, girls.  It must have been rough back then.  Wow.  Well, I met a guy who was, like, 95 upstate.  And he, when my ex and I had lived up there.  And he told us his life story.  And part of it was...  Must have taken a while.  Well, at some point...  That's a long weekend.  He told us...  At some point, he got to a part where he moved in with his brother-in-law.  He said, and then my brother-in-law moved in together.  And then me and my brother-in-law got this new house. 
[02:54:00]  Like, he lived with...  And I think brother-in-law was a code thing back then.  Who lives with their brother-in-law?  Who lives with their brother-in-law?  What does that make any sense?  What is that?  Your sister's husband?  Yeah, really?  You live with just the two of you?  Yeah, where's the sister?  There's no...  It's just brother...  My brother-in-law and I live together.  Brother-in-law.  Brother-in-law.  That was a...  I think that was a code...  He was basically telling you...  Back in the day.  Did you know he was gay?  What?  Did you know he was gay?  I think that guy would never have in a million years said out loud... 
[02:54:30]  Fessed up to it, but...  He lived with his brother-in-law.  They probably shared 50 years of life together.  Wow.  But pretty much every drop of come into one another for all that time.  But if you said, are you gay?  He'd be like, what are you talking about?  What kind of thing is it to say?  Yeah, yeah.  Brother-in-law.  That is an odd thing.  I guess, yeah, over the years, it's had to have been different terms.  I mean, gay was...  Was happy and gay.  Before it became gay. 
[02:55:00]  Queer was just something a little odd.  You wouldn't identify something like that.  No.  It's just something that happened, I think.  Yeah.  Because even that, in old movies, you hear, it's like, wow, that situation's a bit queer.  Yeah.  You know?  And queer became...  Hey, I think he's queer.  That's the first guy that used that one.  He must have gotten a good laugh, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, see those two guys?  I think they're queer.  Ah, you just call them queer?  That's hilarious.  That's a great way to put it.  They are.  That's hilarious.  They are queer.  Let's start using that.  And then someone else hears it.

[03:00:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, Molly Crabapple.  Hey, thanks for having me.  Thanks for coming.  It's so cool.  So cool to make contact with you.  Cool to see your stuff on the internet.  I first found out about you because actually a dispute that you had with Amber Lyon.  You guys are buddies now.  Everything got worked out.  Everything got worked out, yeah.  But I went to your page, and I was like, holy shit, what cool art.  Like, really interesting stuff.  Like, very distinct and fascinating.  And I started reading your tweets, and I was like, oh, she's really fucking smart. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, cool.  Man, thank you.  So here you are.  Thanks so much.  Oh, you're welcome.  And you were telling us about, what was the thing that you did where you had to paint a mural?  You were talking about it, like, right before.  It was like, how many hours was it?  So I was in London, jet-legged, off my ass, reeling.  And I had to paint a 50-foot mural in three days.  Like, up on a ladder, all, you know, intricate Sharpies.  And modafinil got me through this.  The wonder drug that people don't want to, that's what people speak of in hushed tones. 
[03:01:00]  They don't want to admit they take it.  I even had the guy who was one of the directors of MAPS on the show.  And he was reluctant to talk about taking modafinil before the show because he was tired.  And I was like, do you know how crazy that is, man?  You're part of the multidisciplinary psychedelic studies group.  And you're afraid to tell people that you took some modafinil before a show?  Not afraid, but he was just a touch reluctant.  And then he divulged it.  But I'm like, that stuff is great. 
[03:01:30]  I think he could get very addictive, though.  I think that's not physically addictive as far as what I've experienced.  But the effects are so real and so obvious that I would think that some people would be like,  I want to be on it all the time, man.  Well, it gets rid of, like, all of the weakness of your meat self.  It makes you just not tired.  It makes you focused.  You don't get distracted.  Anyone would want to be on it all the time.  They'd be like, I'm fucking Superman.  Wow, you got a really powerful reaction to it.  I loved it.  I didn't have that same reaction. 
[03:02:00]  I didn't feel like, I just felt sharper.  That's it.  I didn't feel like, you know, like Superman.  I just, I felt like I have less lag in my system.  That's how I felt.  You know, but it didn't make me feel any stronger or anything like that.  But I do know it's outlawed the Olympics.  It is.  Interesting.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, it probably has some profound effects on the body as well.  If you think about the effects that it has on the mind, that stuff is amazing.  I found out about it from Dave Asprey was the first person.  But after the fact, like he did the podcast and was like this really sharp, really fucking, 
[03:02:30]  like smooth talking guy with so much information.  And I was like, God, this guy never runs out of energy.  Like, this is crazy.  And then I watched this special that was like a special on ProVigil.  And he was on it and talking about taking this stuff and, you know, this incredible effect that it has and all these IT people are on it.  And I was like, oh, okay, I got to try this.  So the first time I tried it, I called him up.  And I was like, this is fucking crazy. 
[03:03:00]  Like, and I had the same feeling that, like, Tim Ferriss had.  Tim Ferriss, who wrote that four-hour body and four-hour work week, he didn't put it in his book specifically because he would worry that people would just be eating it like candy.  Oh, that's so interesting.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He got to that part of the book.  He was like, fuck this, man.  They're going to just start eating it.  People are crazy.  This kid's giving this stuff.  I don't think people understand.  I think there's a lot of people out there that don't know about modafinil. 
[03:03:30]  Well, don't get turned on to it.  So there's more for those who need it.  I think they'll be fine.  I think the government knows how to make that stuff.  I mean, that's the Uber munch.  They're going to, it's going to come out of a modafinil bottle.  So, yeah, you just, I gave one to Brian.  He was in here and he had to drive to San Diego and he had got like two hours sleep and he  was ready to conk out.  And I was like, trust me, just eat this.  Did I even tell you to eat?  I thought you'd eat half.  Half of it.  Eat a half of one.  Just eat a half of one.  Immediately I went from like just having the worst day of my life to just, everything's 
[03:04:00]  fine.  Everything's great.  I need to get more of that.  It's fascinating.  It's fascinating.  I mean, where did that come from?  I didn't even find out about that stuff until a year ago.  You know, what's going to be a year from now?  What kind of fucking, I mean, it doesn't even seem to have any negative side effects.  Oh yeah.  Is there any?  I don't know.  I'm just like Tim Ferriss though.  Like his, his quote that there's no biological free lunch.  Remember when he was talking about it? 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  It's a, I don't know.  I hope it doesn't do anything to you because it's pretty awesome.  I guess the only side effect would be if you just used it not to sleep.  Because if you, you can't not sleep, even if you don't feel sleepy.  Allegedly, it allows you to go to sleep.  I've never tried it.  Every time I've tried the stuff, it's because I have a lot of work to do when I need, you  know, but I won't let myself do it more than once every couple of weeks.  Like once, once a month even.  It's just too delicious. 
[03:05:00]  No, same.  That's my, um, it's my special crutch for when I have some giant mural project where I  know I'm going to be on a ladder for 14 hours.  Yeah.  Some people have a different reaction to it though.  Um, some people just, you know, to them, it's just like coffee.  It's interesting.  I've heard a couple of people's different descriptions of what it does for them.  So I think there's also a difference between pro vigil and new vigil.  Have you tried new vigil?  No, I haven't.  New vigil is the stuff that I gave you.  Right.  Um, so that, the, the pro vigil got you through. 
[03:05:30]  Do you felt, do you paint, do you paint, do you paint any differently when you're on  it or off of it?  So drawing at that sort of scale, like when I'm doing those murals is like the mental  equivalent of picking scabs.  It is so boring.  You're just making these tiny repetitive lines over and over.  And it actually makes me paint better because I get this hyper focus and I can deal with the  pain and boredom of what I'm doing.  Wow.  That's pretty cool.  So when you're, when you're designing something like this, like this enormous mural, do you  draw it out on a micro scale first? 
[03:06:00]  Like how do you, how do you go about making something like that?  When I was doing the London thing, I just riffed.  I had kind of an idea that I was going to do the decline and fall of civilization as told  through this nightclub I was working on.  And I just fucking let it pour out of my hands.  Wow.  So you've just free balled it.  The whole thing.  I free balled it.  Yeah.  Wow.  That is so cool.  Do you ever free ball something and get halfway into it and be like, eee, I should have gone  a different direction here?  Well, with murals, it's easy not to do that because there's so much space. 
[03:06:30]  You could just kind of work around it.  But I've had that all the time when I'm working on a piece.  I'll like draw half of it and I'll be like, oh man, I screwed up the head.  The stairs are all crooked.  This is failure.  Let me burn this like, like a child who has failed me.  Yeah, I used to draw a lot as a child and I originally wanted to be a comic book artist.  I was really fascinated by comic book art and that Frank Frazetta type stuff.  And when I started to draw a lot, like sometimes I would get on these periods where I would 
[03:07:00]  start something and then halfway in it, I'd be like, ugh, I've got to drop this one.  And I realized when you start becoming a comedian that it's sort of the same thing in everything.  Like when you're being creative, if you're trying something out, whether it's writing or  whatever, to really truly create, you have to kind of explore like whatever weird whims.  And some of them pan out and some of them don't, right?  It's so true.  And also when you're a creative person, you have to just accept that your first like five  years, you're just going to not be very good. 
[03:07:30]  And the problem is usually you want to be creative because you have kind of, you know,  you have good taste, you have a vision and you see so clearly the ways you fail your vision  and you just have to learn how to stick through your fail period.  Yeah, I think the fail period's huge though.  It's so important for, I think, every art form.  I think you have to suck at it to really appreciate what's magical about being good at it.  Oh God, yeah.  And then there's this moment, this one happy day when it feels effortless just for one  second and it was all worth it.  And then other people are like, oh, it's easy for you. 
[03:08:00]  Get a real job.  Yeah, those people are hilarious.  They get a real job.  Why would you want to wish that on anybody?  I know.  Why would you want to wish a real job?  That's rude.  Get a real job.  Stop chasing your dreams.  How did you become a famous artist?  What happened?  So I've been drawing since I was four years old.  My mom is an amazing illustrator.  She like illustrated like Cabbage Patch Kids or like, you know, stuff for gumball machines.  Super good.  Way better than I am.  And so I was making all like the little kiddie mistakes that kids do. 
[03:08:30]  And my mom would just be like, no, no daughter of mine is going to draw a nose like an upside  down seven.  You're going to do this right.  And then I just got good at it.  And I got good at hustling money with it.  Like I'd be 17 and I would hang up flyers at Forbidden Planet offering to draw people's  D&D characters.  That's hilarious.  That's a slick move.  Thank you.  Or I would like draw people's pets.  I draw their kids.  It's just when you're making art, you're able to take raw materials that cost $2 and turn 
[03:09:00]  it into something that costs $500 or $1,000 or $10,000.  Everything is like all the value is in you.  And so I just, I kept doing it.  I was addicted both to drawing and also to the hustle of it.  That's fascinating.  I like that you admit that because a lot of people, I'm just about the art.  I don't even care about the money.  Oh, fuck those people.  That's a trust fund.  That's their trust fund talking.  I love the idea that you can be creative and pursue money.  No, it's, it's absolutely true.  And I mean, why not? 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  It's the alternative is having some fucking gallery milking you and taking 50% of what  you make.  And is that what they take?  Yeah.  They take 50%.  Whoa, that seems like a lot.  I know.  Right.  It's like worse than agents, worse than anything.  50%.  Wow.  That's crazy.  And then do you have to have like an exclusive deal with them?  Is that like how a lot of them do it?  So like if they take 50%, you can't just go to another place and they also sell a different  painting and then they take 50% too.  Do they have a piece of you forever? 
[03:10:00]  It depends on the deal you have.  But if you were working with like some big gallery, yeah, they would have a piece of  you.  And also you wouldn't be able to sell your work privately.  Like they would, like if someone came to you and was like, yo Joe, I want to buy one  of your comics panels, you'd have to go to the gallery and have them negotiate the deal  and take their cut.  It really is all dependent upon like what you can get away with, you know, because if  you're like, we were talking the other day about reality shows where the people who go  on those shows, they have to sign, you know, different shows with different contracts,  obviously.  But if, if you're on one of those, like what, just name a show, hairdresser show, you're 
[03:10:30]  making, you know, those people have to sign these crazy contracts where they can use your  likeness for like the rest of their, of your natural life.  They're like, they, they own a piece of like everything you do in show business, essentially.  It's this weird thing that they can, they're kind of can say, they kind of can say like,  we're making you.  So because we're making you, we own a chunk of you.  And it's so sad now, especially because if you want to be your own entity, if you want 
[03:11:00]  to be famous, you don't need those bastards.  Like you can make a niche for yourself.  You don't need to sign away your soul to some like vampiric reality corporation.  That's going to make you look like a fool.  Yeah.  The thing is that that system is already plugged in, runs smoothly and extracts money.  You know, that's the television system.  It's, it's, it's runs very smoothly.  We all know we can go to A&E and get quality programming.  We all know that we can go to HBO and watch Game of Thrones.  So we're just, it's, it's like completely plugged in. 
[03:11:30]  We're so completely used to it that there, if you, especially if you're going to do a  reality show, that's like where you would go.  If you just like, just anything to get famous, boom, you know, that's where you would go.  And you, you sort of have to become a part of that system.  But if you're an artist, do you have to go initially with galleries?  Like, how do you break out?  Do you break out entirely through social media?  Like, how do you, uh...  I never went through galleries.  I mean, I've been in like a few group shows, but galleries never really wanted me. 
[03:12:00]  So I was pretty much entirely through the internet and also through doing art about stuff that  other people cared about.  Like, it's one thing if you're just doing abstract pastel canvases, but like I would go  to Guantanamo Bay and draw that.  So people who cared about Guantanamo Bay or civil liberties would also be turned on to  my art.  Oh, wow.  So, now, and I'm sorry I connected you with reality shows.  It's not intentional.  It was probably a poor analogy, but my, my analogy of the struggling person who gets sucked. 
[03:12:30]  And it's all really what you can get away with.  That, you know, a person in a reality show, like, hey, it could be you, it could be anybody  else, buddy.  Sign the line.  Or as an artist, has options.  And when an artist develops, like, a group of people that appreciate their art and then  it spreads out, then you totally have options.  So then, you know, you're essentially running your own show now, right?  Exactly.  And that's why they propagandize so much the idea that artists can't know anything about  money.  The idea that talking about money makes you corrupt. 
[03:13:00]  Because if you believe that in your heart of hearts, you're really vulnerable to bad,  shitty deals that take 50% of what you make.  Yeah, because those people, they're like, listen, we're all going to make money.  You need us and we need you.  And that's true, but like 50%, it's like, that seems crazy.  You just have a building, dude.  You got a building?  Well, you put the stuff up.  How did you get 50% for putting a light on it?  I mean, that is one of the weirdest deals ever.  Like, one person is actually creating the art and the other person has a window and a roof 
[03:13:30]  and they get half.  That seems like a rip off.  And the whole model is like, you spend a year, two years, you know, slaving on your  show.  You put all of the money it takes to do it up yourself, like all the money in the canvas,  the paints, you know.  Then you hang your show for a month.  What sells, sells.  What doesn't usually can't be re-shown because it's kind of a failure.  And then, um, you get 50% when the gallery deigns to pay you.  When and how long is that sometimes? 
[03:14:00]  Like a few months, a year.  A year?  There have been, there have been stories.  I've had friends who haven't gotten paid by their galleries like ever.  Like they did a whole show, put up all that money, all that effort and zero.  And what do they do?  They try to sue.  They, you know.  Oh God.  Yeah, the, the, there's a weird, there's a weird group of people, no matter what discipline  you're involved in, whether it's art, whether it's music, whether it's comedy, there's, you're  going to run into people that are kind of swindlers, right?  No, like in New York, um, in Times Square, there are always these guys that are like standing 
[03:14:30]  out in the snow, giving out flyers for comedy clubs just in exchange for their chance to  perform for a little bit.  Yeah.  And like, sometimes I look at them and I feel so bad.  I'm like, man, this, the system is so disrespectful to you.  Like you're providing the talent and you're also standing out in the freezing cold, like  handing these things, these flyers out.  Yeah.  That's not a fun system to be a part of the, uh, trying to get on stage system.  But for the comics, like, you know, I always think, man, if they just do that, they'll have  more funny shit to talk about. 
[03:15:00]  You know, they'll, if they just do that and make it through, you know, and then eventually  become a professional, they could actually like talk about that.  They could actually, you know, sit down on a talk show and talk about how they used to  hand out flyers in the village for the comedy cellar, you know, before they could ever get  on stage.  And it's, it's a, almost like a badge of honor that you did something like that.  I could, I could definitely see that.  But only if you're like 21.  Yeah.  Not if you're 40.  If you're 40 and you're handing out, well, I don't know.  Fuck it, man.  If you're even more of a hero, if you're 40 and you quit your job and you're 40 and you're 
[03:15:30]  out there handing out flyers, that's even more fucking crazy.  Then I got some respect for you.  Still in my heart of hearts, I want there to be a way like for people to make it as  comedians or to make it in any creative thing without having to do that sort of like bowing  down, handing out flyers in the snow.  Well, I think that the clubs are really vulnerable, unfortunately.  It's, it's, there's not a lot of business in comedy clubs.  And I think they probably, I don't know which clubs specifically pay people to hand out flyers  or what have you, but it's, it's hard for clubs to stay open these days. 
[03:16:00]  It's hard for people to get people to come in and sit down and watch comedy shows.  And I think a lot of it is the comedian's fault, you know?  I mean, uh, a lot of it is, uh, people that don't, they don't stay in touch with their  audience enough.  I think there's a lot of bad comedy out there too, unfortunately, like you can't always find  like a good show.  It's difficult to find a good show.  Like you could, LA is pretty exceptional.  I mean, LA has, there's a hundred great comics that live like in and around LA, like easily. 
[03:16:30]  Right.  Wouldn't you say I, I, I, me a new one every day too.  Like it's just nonstop.  Yeah.  So many funny people here.  This is unusual, but it's like people don't want to take a chance and go to a comedy club  on a Thursday night.  And that's a lot of times what, you know, these clubs need.  They need like a real big Thursday night, a big Wednesday night, a big, and when they can  do that, then they can pay their bills and stay open.  But for us, without them, life would suck. 
[03:17:00]  Imagine if you didn't have comedy clubs and you had to like organize, like open mic nights  to work out new material at the Roxy or some shit.  Yeah.  Next to a pool table.  It'd be terrible without them, without the ice house and the comedy and magic club and  places like that.  But that's a different relationship than that of a gallery and an artist.  Like you really don't need them.  No.  I mean, we need club owners.  I mean, if I wanted to sell my paintings for a million bucks, which is its own thing,  I would need them because Russian oligarchs and hedge fund guys, they work with galleries. 
[03:17:30]  I mean, they don't want to like be fucking coming over to my studio and having awkward  conversation with me.  They want to, you know, go to like sleek white gallery and have somebody who speaks their  language, assure them that it's a good investment.  Right.  But I don't sell work for a million dollars.  So there is a niche for me just to be on my own.  I think you can sell work for a million dollars.  We just have to make it so that you can sell work for a million dollars.  I mean, I don't mean we, but I mean anybody who's like involved in deciding what things  cost.  If they just decided your work cost a million bucks, it's totally rational. 
[03:18:00]  It makes sense.  I mean, there is work out there that costs a million bucks, right?  Why can't yours?  If for sure it could.  It's a weird thing.  It's like art.  It's like two things at once.  Like on one hand, it's like this object of beauty and pleasure.  But on the other hand, it's also like a stock, you know, it's an investment and stocks  like the price of them.  It's kind of arbitrary and it's the same with art and it has everything to do with like  who collects it, what collections you're in, what gallery you're in.  It's almost like the value is determined entirely based on the approval of certain people and 
[03:18:30]  has nothing to do with intrinsic qualities at all.  Well, there's also really clever ways of getting people excited about the price of something.  And who was it that was telling us about this?  Oh, it was a friend that was talking to Tom Segura and I when we were in New York.  He was talking about how they set up, galleries set up an artist in one way.  They'll gift these pieces.  And he was talking about this particular photographer.  And they created this guy's entire career by gifting these really enormous, very beautiful 
[03:19:00]  pieces to famous collectors and saying, this is a $50,000 piece.  The gallery would like to gift this to you just out of, you know, token of our appreciation  of your business, whatever.  So they give him this beautiful picture and then he seeds these to a couple other people.  Now, if there's like art collectors, they're all keeping up with the Joneses type guys.  And if there's some new guy who's given out $50,000 pieces to that guy and then Mike has  one and Shelly has one, I need to get one too. 
[03:19:30]  Like, where is this guy?  I need to go, oh my God, he's amazing.  And then boom, next thing you know it, they do a gallery showing and they put up this  guy's stuff and they've already established the price point.  They told him, I'm gifting you a $50,000 piece.  And then boom, it's $50,000 for all these different photographs.  And they're flying off the shelves and they're making hundreds of thousands of dollars in  a day.  You know, obviously more than a day to take the pictures and print them and all that.  But it's an incredible windfall of money.  And it was created with a sort of artificial demand based on gifting things. 
[03:20:00]  No, it's absolutely ingenious.  Also, Damien Hirst, when he did that skull covered in diamonds, he started kind of...  Can you pull that up?  Pull that up, Brian, if you can find it online.  He started kind of a, what do I want to call it, like a fund, a group of people, including  himself, to buy the skull at auction so that it could be the highest priced artwork ever  done.  So he was spending his own money on his own art just to create this, a weebrus of wealth. 
[03:20:30]  Wow, that's hilarious.  That's a smart thing.  Wait, this is it?  This is it right here?  Yeah.  Wow, that's beautiful.  God.  If you're a rapper.  Is that a real skull?  Yeah, it is.  You can buy real skulls.  Isn't that weird?  Remember when I had that piranha tank?  I had the real skeleton in it?  Bought a skeleton.  Bought like a femur.  A couple of human heads.  You just buy them.  Didn't that creep you out?  Like there was like spirits attached to that.  I don't buy it.  Energy.  I think it's just a bone. 
[03:21:00]  Didn't feel a fucking thing.  It's so weird.  It's very weird.  I'm just used to think.  Well, not only not, but who knows how they died?  Who the fuck knows how they died?  How are you getting a hold of bones?  Don't worry about it.  When you're buying bones from Malaysia, do you really have a direct line of, what was the term you would use?  Like a direct line of possession from the body, from the person being alive to them being dead to you having that skull on your desk?  And do you just throw it away? 
[03:21:30]  How do you get rid of it?  I just got rid of it.  Wink, wink.  The bones were dissolving in the water.  I found that fascinating.  Like very quickly.  Like within a year, the bones were dissolving.  Wow.  And just regular, that's my, you know, fresh water.  I had a fresh water tank.  So imagine, you know, in the ocean, how quickly your bones dissolve.  Probably even more quickly, right?  Or would it be the opposite because of the salt content?  Would it be the opposite?  That is so, I'm just freaked out.  I didn't know that was a real skeleton this whole time.  Yeah, totally. 
[03:22:00]  So is it like a memento mori for you or is it just decoration?  Um, well, uh, I'm an asshole and I thought it would be cool to have piranhas in my house  and to feed them things where there were skulls laying around on the bottom of the tank.  That's just the true story.  What do you feed piranhas?  Goldfish.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They fuck up some goldfish.  But, you know, what's way cooler than piranhas, though, is people who have those, 
[03:22:30]  if you've ever been to someone who has like a reef, like they have a coral reef  and like all those like little reef dwelling plants and stuff, like really delicate plants,  very difficult to grow.  So it's hard to do correctly.  We have like one of those really beautiful coral reef looking things.  But when they do have them, they have these incredibly colorful fish.  I mean, it's constant art.  I mean, if you look at a coral reef, like one of those really good tanks that people put together,  they have that one reality show. 
[03:23:00]  That's, yeah, mine was like a real skull.  They have that, um, it was a long time ago, ladies and gentlemen.  I've changed.  I wouldn't do that today.  I have kids.  But the, um, they, they can make them so that it's like mesmerizing.  Like you're just looking at all these different colors of plants and these different colors of these weird little fish.  That's way more beautiful than piranhas.  Piranhas are boring.  They just sit there and wait to kill something.  Then when you throw a goldfish in there, they fuck the goldfish up and then that's it. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  But they're not beautiful.  So there's, uh, things that are beautiful and there's things that are not beautiful.  And I don't know, I'm not sure I could define why something's beautiful, why something's not.  And sometimes what's beautiful changes.  Like there's people that are so tired of traditional beauty that ugliness becomes beautiful to them.  Scars become beautiful to them.  Character becomes beautiful to them.  You know, people just, they change what, what they find beautiful in the world and what they see. 
[03:24:00]  I think that's pretty fascinating and I don't, I don't know why.  You know?  No, it's a fascinating thing.  I mean, like you take war, like war is one of the ugliest things in the world.  You know, it's the destruction of fucking everything.  But, um, I follow these guys.  They're these Western Muslim fundamentalists who are going to fight in Syria right now.  And, um, they all have Instagram accounts.  Jesus.  And their Instagram accounts are the most fetishist, most, um, like they're fetishizing war.  They are like taking these horrifying scenes from like Aleppo or Raqqa and they're running 
[03:24:30]  them through filters and they're, they're kind of making, they're ripping them out of context  and making them beautiful.  And it's this weird thing because it's like, you know, that if you were there, this, you  know, this apocalypse, this is death.  It's like the end of thinking beings.  But over the internet, through all these filters, it becomes beautiful.  Like when you stand far enough away.  Wow.  That's an interesting way to think about it.  That it really truly is what it is.  Going through a bunch of filters.  And that's the only way you could ever watch like Saving Private Ryan. 
[03:25:00]  It has to go through all these filters.  Exactly.  They have to like take the horror and make it aesthetic.  Yeah.  And detach you from it in some way.  You know, put you, put you into it, but still detach you from it.  Yeah.  Otherwise no one would ever accept it.  I mean, the only reason why people accept war in this day and age is because it's nowhere  near us.  Exactly.  Yeah.  I mean, why would you accept something that's taking living, thinking, loving people and  turning them into red mash?  Yeah.  And all with dubious intent. 
[03:25:30]  I mean, there's, there's reasons to go to war.  There's reasons to defend countries against invaders.  And then there's like weird shit where like, wait a minute, why are we over there?  What did the Afghanistan, what did they do?  What did they do to us?  This seems like a weird adventure.  We're over there for how many years?  What the fuck is going on?  Yeah.  And that it's still going on in 2013.  It's very, it's very bizarre.  2014.  It's still going on.  I mean, part of the problem is that America, we like to go to war, not with actual people, 
[03:26:00]  but with concepts.  Like we have the war on drugs, right?  We're going to war with, with drugs.  You can't, drugs can't surrender.  Drugs can't give up and say you win.  And then we go to war on terror.  Terror is a tactic.  Terror can't surrender, you know?  And it leads to all these incredibly, incredibly dubious decisions, whether it's like New York,  where cops are frisking young guys' balls just to look for marijuana, or whether it's  fucking Gitmo, or whether it's this unending war in Afghanistan.  Yeah, there's, there's definitely more information about it today than ever before, too. 
[03:26:30]  You know, there's so many people taking little YouTube videos of people doing fucked up things,  and it just, there's, there's just more ways for people to sort of spread the truth than  kind of ever before.  It's, it's harder to keep a Gitmo open today than it was a long time ago.  Like the more stories that come out of there, and the more you're like, Jesus, what the fuck  are they doing?  Like, what are they doing?  They're playing loud music, and keeping them up all night, and hog tying them, and waterboarding 
[03:27:00]  them, and like, what are you getting out of that?  Like, this is, we guys are fucking freaks.  What are you doing?  Just, what are you doing to people?  Like, does that work?  When I was there, one of the things that I learned that I hadn't realized before was,  most of the guys there are people that we bought for bounties in Afghanistan.  We bought them?  Yeah, basically, so this is what we did.  So, um, war in Afghanistan starts, we're looking for Arab, Arab dudes in Afghanistan.  Um, you know, like, like Bin Laden was, they called them the Afghan Arabs. 
[03:27:30]  There are these, like, guys who had, um, you know, they had fought the Russians and then  stayed on, and, you know, were fundies.  So we're looking for these guys.  So what we do is we drop fucking flyers on Afghanistan, offering 5,000 buck bounties for  any Arabs they capture.  Now, $5,000 in Afghanistan is 10 years local salary.  So what happens is they just bring in Arabs.  They're not terrorists, necessarily.  They're not fighters.  They're just fucking Arab dudes.  They also bring in a bunch of, like, random Afghan dudes who are, like, mentally ill or  owe debts to people or use drugs or who otherwise have annoyed them. 
[03:28:00]  And then these guys, we buy them for 5,000 bucks.  The locals are like, yeah, he's a terrorist.  I'll give him my money.  And then they go over to Gitmo, and there's no way for them to prove that they're innocent.  What?  Wait a minute.  Really?  Really.  I mean, there are...  How many of them are like that in there, you think?  Well, how about this, okay?  Almost 800 people have gone through Gitmo.  We've had eight convictions for war crimes so far. 
[03:28:30]  Wow.  So, I mean, lots of...  I mean, there are definitely scary, evil fucking people in Gitmo, like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed  or Nashiri.  And then there are also probably, like, misguided teenage dudes who shot a rifle once at us  who, you know...  I mean, they were shooting a rifle, but should they be, like, tortured for 12 years for it?  No, I don't think.  And then there's just people like this one Al Jazeera cameraman that we held there for  a bunch of years.  Just a cameraman?  He was an Al Jazeera cameraman, yeah.  They held him there for years?  They did.  And so, Chelsea Manning, when she leaked the Gitmo files that show kind of our evidence 
[03:29:00]  against people and what we hope to get out of them, what we hope to get out of this guy  was information on Al Jazeera.  Wow.  That's crazy.  So, how many people are in Gitmo currently?  155.  There's 155 guys in there.  And out of those 155 guys, how many of them are, like, really scary people? 
[03:29:30]  And how many of them are these people that were, in your opinion, sold?  So, when I spoke to the chief prosecutor of Gitmo, General Mark Martins, he told me that  20 people are prosecutable there.  20?  20.  So, the rest of them, it's just like, they have them, they just have to keep them now?  Yeah, they're not prosecutable.  Because the thing is, like, just because someone shot a rifle at American forces in Afghanistan  doesn't mean they did a war crime.  Like, that's not a war crime. 
[03:30:00]  That's just, you know, that's just being like a Taliban soldier or whatever.  And so, you can't try them for shooting a rifle at you 12 years ago.  So, their logic is that they're holding these guys until the end of the war.  But the war isn't against Afghanistan, that they're holding them against until the end of.  The war is against terror.  So, they are holding these guys until the end of the war on terror.  Whoa.  Wow.  That's like the war of, that is such an insane statement. 
[03:30:30]  That war has been going on forever.  And it can end.  I mean, terror is a tactic.  Right.  And when did it start?  I mean, is there a defined begin point to the war on terror?  I mean, didn't it, when did it start?  I think 9-11 is when they started the war on terror.  Is that what, but couldn't they backdate it to other terrorist activities?  Like, couldn't they backdate it to the Iranian hostages from the Carter administration if  they really wanted to get crazy?  I mean, couldn't they backdate it to, you know, the attack on Israeli athletes back in 
[03:31:00]  the Olympics?  They could backdate it all the way if they wanted to.  I mean, the war on terror has been on from the beginning of time.  It will never end.  I mean, meaning, like, this is not a war that is going to be over anytime soon.  No, it can't.  So they're just locked up.  Yeah, they're just locked up.  And it's this weird bureaucratic thing.  And part of the problem is, like, okay, let's say you have a dude, right, who either is innocent  or he's, like, some low-level grunt.  And he's been to Gitmo and he can't go back to his home country for whatever reason. 
[03:31:30]  And no other countries want to take him because we've made a big deal about how these guys are  the worst and the worst in the world.  And we can't resettle them to America because Americans are fucking cowards who are so terrified  that, like, a 50-year-old man might, I don't know, blow something up.  So they're just stuck there.  By the way, people, like, right-wing people are going crazy right now.  America's bunch.  You think we're cowards?  Because we don't want a man who's in Guantanamo Bay walking amongst my children. 
[03:32:00]  Okay, so here's an example of what I'm talking about.  There are these dudes, and we finally let them out after 12 years, but they're Uyghurs.  So they are Chinese guys fighting.  They're a Chinese ethnic minority.  They were fighting against China.  They had no problem with us.  They were swept up in the war on terror, and they were put in Guantanamo.  Immediately, we realized that these guys weren't fighting us. 
[03:32:30]  They were fighting China.  Multiple tribunals decided this.  The Bush administration said these guys, you know, not fighting us.  There were church groups that wanted to take them in America and resettle them here.  China wanted them back because China wanted to torture them to death.  But we were so fucking scared as a country that we would not allow the resettlement of anti-Chinese people in America.  So what did we...  We kept them in Gitmo.  We slowly got rid of them one by one. 
[03:33:00]  We put them in, like, Albania.  We put some of them in, like, a fucking...  Where was it?  It was, like, some Polynesian island took some of them.  We put the last of them in Slovakia very recently.  It sounds like if somebody one day writes a book on Guantanamo Bay, it's going to be a doozy.  Yeah.  Right?  That book's going to be a doozy.  That sounds nuts.  That's a terrifying thing that humans can do. 
[03:33:30]  And we touched upon it a bit yesterday with the immoral technique, that the way that people can dehumanize the other, you know, whether it's another gender, whether it's another race, whether it's another nationality, whether it's another sexual orientation, whatever the other that we can justify, like, dehumanizing.  People are capable of incredible ugliness.  It's so strange, the broad range of what we're capable of, like, amazing, loving things and the worst. 
[03:34:00]  Like, I have a friend, and he has these neighbors, and they're an old couple, and they come over, and they're like his kids' long-lost grandparents.  They're so nice.  It's like they've always been a part of the family.  They're just really sweet people who live next door.  And they buy the kids, like, presents for Christmas, and they do little cute things with them, and they'll, like, babysit them.  And they love these kids like family. 
[03:34:30]  They just got lucky.  Just got lucky and moved next to some beautiful people who are super cool and friendly.  But you could also move next to someone who wants to eat your kids.  You know, I mean, we're capable of so much of a range.  It's hard to wrap your head around sometimes.  It really is.  No, it's the most fascinating thing.  Like, we have, you know, this little bit of light between these two voids, and we can do anything with it.  We can, you know, we can make the most amazing art.  We can, like, fucking save kids, and we can love each other, and then we can also turn each other into red mash. 
[03:35:00]  I wonder if it's important to have both.  I wonder if it sounds like a weird thing to say, but if everything is natural, I mean, if the way giraffes form herds, the way birds fly together in the sky, and what something looks like it's orchestrated.  If all that stuff is natural, why would we assume that human behavior isn't natural, too?  And although it's, like, super complex and way more complicated than what we see in the animal world, all these, like, pushes and pulls and struggles and accomplishments, all that stuff together, the evil and the good, it's almost like you can't appreciate one without the other. 
[03:35:30]  Without the evil, it almost seems like the actual good just wouldn't have the same feeling that it has.  It has this amazing feeling because we understand loss, because we understand evil, we understand aggression, we understand all these really uncomfortable, unfortunate aspects of humanity.  So when we find someone who's awesome, you know, it's just, that's why it feels so good. 
[03:36:00]  If everybody was awesome, we'd be like a bunch of fucking, like a nation of spoiled lottery winners.  You know, like, where we have just no idea how lucky we are, just stumbling through the whole thing.  But it's almost like to see the evil and to hear about things like Guantanamo Bay, it's horrific, of course, but it's almost like it gives the loving part of humanity more energy.  It's almost like inspired to perform stronger acts of love in the face of the most fucked up shit available in 2014. 
[03:36:30]  It's real weird, because I think there's a relationship there that's unavoidable, and I don't like that feeling.  I don't like the idea that we're never going to get our shit together.  I'd like to think that people will get their shit together.  I'd like to think that within my lifetime, I would see a massive change in the way people interact with each other.  Because I think it's possible with individuals.  If it's possible with individuals, it should be possible with all of us. 
[03:37:00]  But then the other part of me, the more rational part that's not going on emotions and hope, says, I think that this is always how it's going to be.  This is how shit keeps moving.  If you don't have this, you don't keep moving.  If you don't have murder, if you don't have rape, if you don't have horror, you don't have people salting people,  if you don't have drug overdoses and car accidents, then you don't appreciate peace.  Then the lake doesn't look so beautiful.  Then the birds chirping don't mean as much.  The whole thing is reliant upon each other. 
[03:37:30]  And the love that you get, the strength of it, is almost dependent upon your understanding of evil in the world.  Dependent upon your understanding of death.  Dependent upon your understanding of misfortune.  Well, just by being human, you're kind of born into that tragedy.  We're the only animal that understands that we're going to die.  We think, right?  We don't know about dolphins.  That's true.  They might know us up.  So, like, my cat, who I had since I was 11, I love this little beast so much. 
[03:38:00]  And we just had to put her to sleep finally.  She's, like, 20 years old.  And I don't think she knew.  Like, one day she's just, like, sproinging around, being bad, stealing shit.  And then the next day her, like, back legs stopped working.  And, yeah, poor little beast.  I was so sad.  But I think it was, like, kind of merciful.  Like, she didn't know.  Like, we had to know and kind of decide for her, you know?  Yeah.  Well, it would have just been really slow, especially if she's in a protected environment where she has good food and a warm place to sleep. 
[03:38:30]  And it takes a long time for their little bodies to quit.  But we were both talking about how I have a cat who's, she's 17 now.  I've had her since she was a little tiny baby.  My sister gave her to me.  And she was, like, a little fluff ball.  And she does this howl thing at night.  We were talking about, it's like, you know, they say that it's like cats don't know what they're doing.  It's like a form of cat dementia.  Like, they might even have, like, cat Alzheimer's.  She's old as fuck. 
[03:39:00]  17 is really old.  But what was the phrase that you used?  That it was, like, the opera song of death.  Oh, yeah, mine does that.  How old's yours?  Uh, about 15.  Yeah.  Those old cats, man.  That's a weird thing they do.  She never did that when she was younger.  I think it's also, like, you know how when people start to lose their hearing and then they start talking louder and louder to compensate?  I think this might be the cat thing.  She's like, human, get me food.  But she doesn't hear herself, so she has to just scream at the top of her lungs. 
[03:39:30]  Maybe.  Maybe they just, maybe even darker.  Here's where it gets really dark.  Maybe that is, like, nature trying to set them up to get killed.  Because it's a nighttime thing.  They're out there moaning and howling.  I mean, maybe unbeknownst to them that that's sort of like a calling card for predators.  To let them know that there's some sort of a suffering animal.  Meow.  Meow.  And, you know, some coyote hears that and is like, oh, shit. 
[03:40:00]  It's the dinner bell.  You know?  Maybe they just get hornier the older they get.  Yeah, like they're all cougars.  Yeah.  Like, come on.  I haven't had sex ever.  I'm about to die.  I want it now.  Yeah, right?  A lot of them have never had sex ever.  That's a good point.  My cats never had sex except for my dog.  Yeah.  Meow.  But they don't do that when they go outside, so my theory sucks.  Because if they're in danger and fear outside, like when my cat goes outside, she doesn't make any noise.  It's only when she's inside, in the comforts of the house, and she lets out that whale. 
[03:40:30]  But it might be just to attract predators to figure out a way in through the doggy door.  Right.  You know?  Can you imagine you woke up and you saw a coyote eating a cat in your house?  Ugh.  That's happened before.  Did you hear about that lady in Chile recently?  She came home, fucking, there was a cougar in her house.  Like, they just took all these photos of it.  It was like wrestling with the lampshades or the shades to the window.  It's just a regular cougar, like an older lady just fucking around a lamp like, I'm here. 
[03:41:00]  Drunk, one shoe on, lipstick's all fucked up.  Fucking with lampshades.  Get out of here, lady.  What are you doing in my house, you crazy bitch?  No, no.  I don't know how we got on that subject.  Cats.  Old cats dying.  Yeah, imagine having Bruce Jenner in your house.  Look at this guy.  Yeah, something's going on.  This is TMZ's alleged discovery that Bruce Jenner's becoming a woman. 
[03:41:30]  Well, he supposedly got his, what, larynx scraped off?  He got his Adam's apple shaved down, allegedly.  That's why he's got a Band-Aid on it.  But who knows?  That shit could be Photoshopped.  Wow, this is TMZ.  And look at those, I mean, it looks like he's getting boobs lately.  Or did he always have that?  He's an old guy.  Old guys like that.  Gravity starts hitting them.  Look, I mean, Sylvester Stallone was one of the few guys that's, like, deep into his 60s  that still works out on a regular basis.  Most people quit.  And Bruce Jenner was this amazing athlete. 
[03:42:00]  He was an Olympian.  He was an Olympic old medalist.  He was on the cover of fucking Wheaties.  And now he's been, it's one of the biggest blows to masculinity in our time is the fall of  Bruce Jenner.  It's like, what's happened to that guy?  Just the way he gets yelled out on that show.  The way he gets demoralized.  He's a fucking Olympian.  You crazy freaks are just detention whores.  This guy is a goddamn Olympian.  You treat him like shit.  And he wants to be a woman now.  You broke Bruce Jenner.  What if this is all just a joke, though? 
[03:42:30]  Like a part of, like, a troll that the Kardashians wrote.  That'd be hilarious.  It could be.  I mean, who knows?  I mean, we're playing right into it.  The whole reality thing, the whole reality show thing is a fascinating aspect of our culture.  It's absolutely fascinating.  I know a lot of people think that it's base and stupid and idiotic.  And most certainly it is.  It's also quite fascinating that that's become something that people are really attracted to,  is the watching the lives of people who have nothing going on that's exceptional. 
[03:43:00]  There's no singing.  There's no dancing.  There's no entertainment.  They're just like you and I, allegedly.  And that that's become something that people are into.  That's really weird.  Well, don't you think it's also because reality shows are so cheap to make?  Because, like, you don't have to hire writers.  You don't have to hire talent.  You just have to take, you know, people who you don't really have to pay a lot of money,  put them in really stressful situations, get ununionized producers who you don't acknowledge  are scripting the entire thing, and put it together. 
[03:43:30]  It's just so much cheaper to do.  There's such an economic impetus behind it.  I think it's also just that it's really effective, too.  They're really high rated.  Like, the Duck Dynasty show got, like, 16 million people to watch it.  I mean, that's a lot of goddamn people.  It's economically effective because it works.  People like watching stupid shit, you know?  That's a fact.  People are tired of thinking when they get home from a job that drains them of any creative juices  that they might still have left from their childhood. 
[03:44:00]  Every day, it's like a fucking bad battery slowly getting drained down to zero.  And they don't have the energy, a lot of them, to watch anything, you know, challenging or fascinating  or read a book or, you know, partake in a hobby.  No, they want to drink a beer, and they want to watch really stupid shit,  whether it's the real housewives or any of that stuff.  It's really fascinating, though, this attraction that we have to it. 
[03:44:30]  It's a weird symptom of where our culture is,  that there's only so many hours of programming on every network in a day.  So many hours.  You know, you only get, like, you know, 12 hours of people really actually paying attention, right?  And what are you putting on during that time?  What are you putting on?  You're putting on shit.  Everybody's putting on shit.  But, like, there's got to be a better way to do this.  Like, the way you guys are doing it, like, it's almost like you're creating stuff that only idiots would like. 
[03:45:00]  And it's a strange thing, because it's at the same time as the most beautiful and amazing things are happening on TV also.  It's at the same time as, like, Mad Men and Breaking Bad.  So there's the most high fucking beautiful art and madness on one hand,  and then there's just stupid swill where vain people are being humiliated on the other.  But the people who are making those shows, I've met them.  They're really nice folks.  It's just they just have a job.  Their job is to make reality TV. 
[03:45:30]  I mean, that's where it becomes a catch-22.  I know a lot of them.  One of my neighbors is a producer who makes reality shows.  Nice guy.  I think most people are nice.  I mean, so I was in Lebanon recently doing this piece for the New York Times about sectarian militias in Tripoli.  And so I interviewed these sniper dudes.  And these guys are like the sharks and the jets, but with rocket launchers and with grenades and stuff.  They're two neighborhoods.  They shoot at each other.  They kill each other.  They train, like, nine-year-old boys to shoot RPG launchers. 
[03:46:00]  Like, it's fucked up.  And I interviewed these guys, and they're really cool.  Like, they're just, like, nice, chill dudes, like, joking around with you, like, sharing cigarettes, showing off their, you know, weapons stash.  They're nice.  Everyone is nice.  Wow.  That's bizarre.  Except when they're not nice, you know?  What a great statement.  Everyone is nice except when they're not nice.  That's like Roadhouse reversed.  Remember Patrick Swayze from Roadhouse?  Be nice until it's time to not be nice. 
[03:46:30]  Oh, God.  You don't remember?  That was the big fucking tough guy statement in Roadhouse, one of the great pieces of American cinema.  Man, I'm so culturally illiterate.  But I just think that it's, most people are pretty cool, unless, until they're in a context where they're, like, where it's not to their benefit to be cool,  or where the rest of the group, you know, is doing something horrible, and then they go along with that.  But just like an average everyday life, most people are, most people are great. 
[03:47:00]  They're real fun.  They'll, like, joke around with you and have coffee and are cool.  Yeah, that gives me hope.  It gives me hope when I look at how many humans there are.  There's 300 million of us in this country, and how really, how little violent crime there actually is.  Because if, you know, we know that people just working beside each other on a daily basis in offices and wherever you work in,  there's going to develop interpersonal conflicts.  There's inter-office dating, and then there's drama that comes from that. 
[03:47:30]  There's inter-office friendships that go sour.  People loan people.  There's potential for violence, like, literally in every office in America, all day, every day.  There's always someone who doesn't like someone.  If you have an office of 200 people, for sure there's, like, a few disputes.  For sure there's a guy who's fucking always parking in my fucking parking spot.  There's a this, a that.  He always handles my paperwork different.  Fuck him.  People are, it's amazing how little we kill each other.  I mean, it really is quite incredible. 
[03:48:00]  These are the sheer numbers.  The problem is we get hit with the news of the entire country and the world, in fact.  Anything extraordinary that happens in other parts of the world, especially cruel, especially nasty or evil, we hear about that, too.  We want to know all the most fucked up shit.  So we're dealing with this impossible-to-understand number of essentially 7 billion human beings.  And then we're hearing a surprisingly low number of horrific things for 7 billion fucking people. 
[03:48:30]  But our brains are still these caveman brains that are designed for uses of tribes of 150 people.  So when we keep hearing about all this bad shit, we're like, imminent danger, danger's around the corner.  We've got to fix, which is the reason why the government can still pull off something like the NSA and say, we need to protect you from terrorism.  So we're going to look at all your girly pictures and all your emails and we're going to listen to all your phone calls because we need to protect from terrorism. 
[03:49:00]  What terrorism?  What terrorism?  What are you talking about, man?  There's 300 million of us.  More people are dying every day from aspirin than are dying from fucking terrorism.  What are you doing?  What's really going on?  Because if you were really trying to protect people, this is not a good way to do it.  It's not a good way to listen to everybody's fucking emails.  You guys can't figure out who the bad guys are?  Didn't they do bad shit already?  Does people just wait their whole life in their super goody two-shoes and then one day do something really bad?  No, not usually, right?  So follow the fucking bad people. 
[03:49:30]  Find them from the jump.  And, you know, you're going to miss a few through the cracks.  But don't take away our rights.  That's ridiculous.  That's some terrorism shit right there because you're making people aware that you're listening to everything they do.  You're watching over them.  You're looking through their fucking laptop webcam and you're justifying it how?  Get the fuck out of here.  That's some creepy, weird, stalker shit that you're allowed to get away with because you're the government. 
[03:50:00]  And I say no.  The government is just people.  And we vote them in and allow them to have power.  We don't allow them to do all this stuff.  This is crazy.  You can't just look through people's email.  That's ridiculous.  That's not effective.  It's ridiculous.  It's insanely rude.  Like, there's so many things about it that are wrong when you're dealing with people who have committed no crimes and, in fact, pay taxes, follow rules, contribute to society. 
[03:50:30]  And you're looking through their stuff, too.  You look through everybody's stuff.  You hold all their phone calls.  Who are you?  Like, you're a person in an organization.  No one granted that organization that kind of power.  You guys are criminals.  This is criminal activity.  You can't just do that.  This has been the Joe Rogan Experience.
