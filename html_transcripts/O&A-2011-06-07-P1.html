<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast heavily featured the Anthony Weiner sexting scandal.  The show opened with Larry King’s humorous introduction, setting the tone for the extensive and graphic discussion of the newly released photos and messages, focusing on details of Weiner’s physique and speculation about further releases. Opie and Anthony reveled in their accurate prediction of the scandal's escalation,  referencing Lisa Weiss and their belief that Weiner’s initial denials were a "tip of the iceberg."  They dissected Weiner's press conference clips, highlighting perceived lies and inconsistencies, and debated his political future, speculating on his sociopathic tendencies and need for attention.  Andrew Breitbart's unexpected presence at the press conference was analyzed, along with rumors of Weiner's alleged encounters with celebrities like Pink and Madonna. Jim Norton recounted his own provocative tweet from the press conference, depicting himself in a compromising position. He also described a night out with Breitbart and Ann Coulter, mentioning a photo of Coulter's shocked reaction.  The hosts contrasted the rapid dissemination of Weiner's scandal via Twitter with older scandals like the Gary Hart/Donna Rice affair. They even role-played a sexually explicit Facebook exchange between Weiner and Weiss using Jimmy and Iraq as stand-ins.

A recorded interview with Breitbart was played, discussing the press conference and the hosts’ previous suspension from XM Radio due to the "Homeless Charlie" incident, also broken by Breitbart.  The show included a call-in segment with listener-submitted "FUs," a brief discussion of Naomi Campbell's lawsuit against Cadbury, and a guest appearance by Jim Florentine.  Florentine, along with Opie and Anthony, engaged in sexually explicit conversations, including detailed descriptions of sexual acts and dick pic sharing. They discussed their experiences with sending dick pics, recounted celebrity encounters (Ozzy Osbourne, Pam Anderson), and promoted Florentine's upcoming one-man show detailing his life story, including childhood sexual abuse.  A significant portion focused on boxing, featuring clips of Mike Tyson's post-fight interviews and discussions about Ali, Tyson, and Sugar Ray Leonard.

The show continued with more boxing discussion, reminiscing about early show moments (like Anthony's Mike Tyson impression) and comparing their podcast's chart performance to Adam Carolla's.  A contentious debate on booking Glenn Close versus individuals from *The Wire* ensued, resulting in a planned "fake" interview with Close. A listener's humorous top-five boxer list (including Tony Danza) led to a discussion about a picture of Danza with a prominent erection.  The hosts also discussed the penis size of comedian Paul Veneers and their manager, Jonathan. Sugar Ray Leonard then joined the show.  The interview heavily featured Leonard's autobiography, detailing his experiences with sexual abuse at ages 15-16 and the shame and anger he carried.  He discussed his self-esteem issues, even during his championship years, and his eventual recovery from addiction.  He named his top five fighters, discussed his relationships with other boxing figures (Duran, Hagler, Hopkins), reflected on the business aspects of boxing (Don King), and discussed the differences between boxing and UFC. Leonard also discussed his infidelity and womanizing,  attributing it to the sudden fame.  The segment concluded with plugs for Leonard's book signing, and Jim Florentine promoted his comedy shows.  A planned interview with Sugar Ray Leonard was also mentioned earlier in the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM's Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean?  So I'm...  Are you out of your mouth?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to intro it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Anthony Weiner rules.  Anthony Weiner rules the earth.  The Weiner.  Good morning. Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Morded.  Did you read the naked truth yet in the New York Post?  No.  I think we have to save this for just a few minutes.  Let everyone wake up, get their sleepies out of their eyes. 
[00:01:00]  Is this...  Is one of the ones releasing something?  Oh, yeah.  A Jewish broad.  A Jewish broad has released her sexting.  A Jew broad.  That she had with Anthony Weiner, this woman.  She's pretty hot.  It's dangerous.  The face shot, anyway.  I don't know what the rest of her looks like.  Lisa Weiss, it looks like.  Oh, she's cute.  She had a little sexting with Mr. Weiner.  By the way, I think once again, we should take an hour of phone calls from our listeners 
[00:01:30]  saying, once again, you guys were right.  Yeah, thank you.  Congratulations again.  Thank you.  I mean, the rest of the media just going with whatever Anthony Weiner said.  And we're like, fuck this guy.  Tip of the iceberg.  This guy's lying.  Tip of the iceberg.  We said it's tip of the iceberg.  I tweeted him last week personally and said, I look forward to your apology, your unsincere  apology, because it's coming.  And he gave it.  We fucking told you guys exactly how this was going to play out.  Classic. 
[00:02:00]  And you know, you didn't have to be a genius to figure it out, because all you have to  do is look at the past.  Right.  This has happened so many times.  Don't read it.  Don't read it yet.  Don't read it yet.  I thought I was looking at my phone.  People are still waking up.  Give them a few more minutes, Jimmy.  Oh, boy.  We might have to have E-Rock play the part of Lisa Weiss.  I agree.  Why is she fat?  Oh, shit. 
[00:02:30]  Sorry.  I didn't mean that.  Why?  What time is it?  So because Anthony Weiner ran to a podium, we don't get the cock pick, I'm guessing?  Was there some kind of back office deal there or something?  All I can say is, I guarantee that that pic is turning up.  We're going to see it.  Oh, yeah.  Because they started releasing pictures, and they went with the one with Anthony Weiner  turned to the side looking seductively, I guess, into his fucking phone with his white 
[00:03:00]  t-shirt on.  Seductively.  And then an hour later, they released a picture of him fucking without a shirt on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And safe to say, we're all about the same age as Anthony Weiner.  What the fuck is he doing?  What?  The guy's in good goddamn shape.  Is he a good physical specimen?  Yes.  What the fuck?  Well, I guess he's eating right with his 1% body fat. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He has no body fat on him.  Yeah.  He says that?  Huh?  You just tell he doesn't, yeah.  And then that picture is in his office.  It's classic, because he's not quite showing all of his face, but he's got pictures of  himself and Bill Clinton and shit in the background.  Anthony Weiner is a dummy.  He is the biggest dummy.  First of all, take away the pictures in the background of the bare-chested shot.  Yeah.  He left his big schnoz in the picture.  He left his schnozola hanging like an elephant trunk. 
[00:04:00]  Right.  Which leaves no doubt that it's Anthony Weiner.  Yes.  Because he's got a big schnozola.  Looks like the record player from the Flinch Dogs.  Not a handsome man at all.  Put that nose down.  We want to hear some fucking tunes.  Exactly.  The tweeting that was going on yesterday was amazing during the press conference.  Yeah.  I got involved.  I got a little overzealous and tweeted a picture of myself from the hotel room.  Why do you always have to make it by yourself?  Well...  It was Anthony Weiner's day, sir. 
[00:04:30]  No, no.  It was Anthony Weiner's day.  I had to show that some occupations, it does no harm.  Ah.  No matter what you do alone in your hotel room, it doesn't do any harm.  You're in pretty damn good shape.  That really annoyed me, that photo.  Oh, I didn't think you saw it.  How could I not?  I'm sorry.  You look like the construction worker from the village people.  Well, that's what I was going for.  I put underwear on my head.  I had a beer in my hand.  Oh, my God.  And a gun in my waistband.  What's wrong with you? 
[00:05:00]  Well, I wanted to show that you can get away with it.  Anthony's in shape, though.  It really annoys me.  I try.  You know.  You look like...  Someone said I look like the Iron Sheik.  Thank you.  I was going to say you look like an old school wrestler.  Iron Sheik, or...  Just an old wrestler in general that's still sort of in shape.  As Colin Quinn said, a Tunisian back alley knife fighter.  Tunisian.  Back alley knife fighter.  You are swarthy.  So you had to send that picture during the press conference?  Yes, I sent that one out.  And then, I don't know. 
[00:05:30]  Were you up last night at all?  Because...  I, you know, I was up until about 11, maybe.  I had quite the evening of merriment.  I've heard.  I've heard.  With Andrew Breitbart.  Oh, was he on the show last night?  No.  No.  He dropped by, though.  And we all went out.  That's some kind of green screen, man.  And you guys aren't...  Oh, no, it wasn't.  Is Gutfeld a fucking drunk?  All I can say...  Gutfeld knows how to drink. 
[00:06:00]  He's a drunk, right?  Bill Schultz really knows how to drink.  Really?  Bill Schultz more than Greg Gutfeld.  And Andrew Breitbart can fucking drink.  Wow.  He's in that line of work.  Dude.  He's got to be hanging out to get the scoop.  Of course he knows how to drink.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What is it, martinis for that guy?  No, it was...  Or straight bourbon or something.  It was wine.  He's a wine guy.  It was wine, yeah.  And as a matter of fact, after Gutfeld went, and yeah, that was... 
[00:06:30]  Oh, was Ann on last night?  Oh, no, Ann Coulter was on Hannity, but she came down to the bar.  What bar do you Republicans hang out at?  I don't really like saying.  I don't want to blow up anybody's spot.  Is it the Poet Place?  It's close.  The Poet Place?  No, no, not that one.  No?  No.  It looks like it.  No.  But there's Ann Coulter, Andrew Breitbart.  Why is Breitbart fucking photobombing your picture with Ann Coulter?  He was totally photobombing it.  What's wrong with this guy?  There is a very, very amazing picture. 
[00:07:00]  It's Ann Coulter with her hand over her mouth, gasping as someone is showing her a cell phone.  That's all I'm going to say.  Who is that guy?  That guy's a reporter for ABC.  He was there too?  Yeah, he was there.  He was there with Breitbart.  What a bunch of drunks.  Oh.  He was there with Breitbart.  Yes, he was.  And there is Ann Coulter's reaction to looking at his cell phone.  Dude, you got to see the cock shot?  I didn't say a thing. 
[00:07:30]  Fucking give it up.  I'm not saying anything.  Let me just ask.  I'm just saying Ann Coulter.  Can we read between the lines?  Ann Coulter is shocked right there at what she's saying.  Let me just ask this thing.  Let me ask this question.  Yeah, yeah.  God.  What?  In general, let me just ask this question.  Would you say, if you had to, six or under?  If I had to say anything, I would go, oh, fucking throw your friends under the bus.  Pretty average.  This radio show is important.  Oh, no.  Pretty average.  But that's coming from you. 
[00:08:00]  But, but, but, nothing to be embarrassed by, but nothing to be like, holy shit over.  That's exactly what I thought.  Yeah, yeah.  Who, that's a great picture of Ann.  I know.  I got her right when she looked at the phone, and she's got her mouth covered with her hand,  and she's just like, and then after that picture, she's laughing her ass off.  Oh, my God.  Hey, just let me ask you a curiosity.  Do you think that, do you think that Representative Wiener's in trouble, politically? 
[00:08:30]  He is in huge trouble.  Oh, no.  He will not fucking get through this.  He's not going to be the mayor?  Get through this.  Mother fucker.  He's not going to, he's not.  Because before this, I kind of liked the guy, and you know.  I like him more now.  Pelosi and crew are throwing his ass out.  Yeah, I know.  Mark my fucking words.  I know.  He's done.  You know why he's done?  He sounded like a sociopath last week, because they just did a montage of all the denials he  did last week, and if he didn't know better, like we do, he's almost believable in 
[00:09:00]  how he lies, which is creepy, that's a sign of a psycho.  Yeah, yeah.  And then he turns it all around yesterday, knowing there's a cockpit and other things,  and he ran to that fucking podium, hoping he could, you know, stop the release of more  photos.  It's obvious.  Breepard got up to the podium first, which was.  How weird is that?  It was a movie moment that doesn't really happen in real life, where the guy that is  pretty much the arch nemesis of the guy that's calling the press conference, runs up to the 
[00:09:30]  fucking podium and gives a press conference before the guy.  That's amazing.  And he came out and pretty much, you know, lambasted everybody, said, you know, that he  will get an apology from Anthony Weiner.  Right.  Because Weiner and crew were saying that he was lying.  He was behind this thing.  A lot of his supporters, Weiner supporters were saying that he was behind this.  And he got up there and was like, hey, you know, journalists, do your jobs.  You know, what kills him is that he sent that picture to the co-ed in Seattle. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  Fucking her life over.  By the way.  And then he tried to apologize to her at the press conference yesterday.  That was silly.  By the way, hundreds, hundreds of communique.  Of course.  Between that.  Between him and the college girl?  Yeah.  And the college girl that he was with?  Apparently, he had told her that he had fucked Pink.  Yeah. 
[00:10:30]  The singer?  The singer.  Pink.  Who, Anthony Weiner did?  Anthony Weiner told this girl that he fucked Pink, tried to fuck Madonna, but couldn't close  the deal.  No.  Yes.  You think he's being truthful?  I swear, yeah.  I think he's telling the truth, though.  This is what I heard.  Oh, it could have been the way he just figured out, like, how to, like, turn this girl on  or something, but this is what he told me.  You obviously had a hell of a night, but I gotta ask this before we continue.  You're sober enough to know what you're saying, right?  I really didn't drink as much last night as I have. 
[00:11:00]  Because your mouth was agape all night with all the shit that was going around?  I was up very late, but I'm not hungover or anything.  You were right in the eye of the hurricane, the story.  Dude, right in the middle of it.  Wow.  Right in the middle.  I got video of an interview, a sidewalk interview with Andrew Breitbart about the whole thing  with him getting into the press conference, and then I got him addressing our situation  with Homeless Charlie, and him getting involved in that and posting it, and I was like, what'd 
[00:11:30]  you do?  And he talks about that.  And then we sat around.  Everybody was gone.  It was me and Andrew Breitbart sitting at a table at a bar talking, and then he called  me like maybe 15 minutes after he left and was like, could you bring the charger to my  charger?  I left it on the table to 48th and Broadway, and I had to bring him his charger.  He'd leave his phone laying around. 
[00:12:00]  He walked away to take a phone call, and his iPad is sitting on the goddamn table, and it  was like, you could punch shit up and just send, with his email address, pictures anywhere  you wanted.  Me and Bill Schultz were laughing our asses off at that.  We're like, let's get his iPad and just start sending people shit.  So is he a fan of the show?  Yes.  Does Breitbart?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  All right.  If people are just tuning in, we got to sort of control this.  The Anthony Weiner press conference happened yesterday, and then Anthony last night was 
[00:12:30]  in the eye of the fucking storm, drinking and partying with Breitbart and all the rest  of these Republican idiots.  It was crazy.  Idiots?  These are fine people.  Is Breitbart a Republican?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he's got to be, right?  He's got to be.  He has quite the disdain for the liberal Democrats.  And if you're just tuning in, Ant tweeted a shitload of pictures.  You can go to his Twitter, Anthony Cumia, and there's a picture of Ant Coulter reacting  to something she's seen on a phone.  Something she's seen on a phone. 
[00:13:00]  It was quite shocking to her.  That may have something to do with the Anthony Weiner situation.  Yeah, it could have something to do.  All I'm saying is, I know he's done.  Is that that guy's real eyebrows, or is that part of his glasses?  He looks like Eugene Levy, doesn't he?  Yeah, he's got the big fucking...  That's an ABC news guy.  This Weiner is extremely creepy.  And listen, a lot of guys do the sexting, a lot of guys take the pictures, all that shit. 
[00:13:30]  It's probably more normal than anyone wants to admit, right?  But there's something about him that is really fucking creepy.  The fact that he lied all last week and was almost believable is kind of scary to me.  And then yesterday, he's under the gun, and he should have done a two-minute press conference.  He's hanging out for 40 minutes because he likes the limelight.  The spotlight, I should say.  Which is kind of creepy, too.  He keeps thinking he can fix this.  The problem with Weiner is he's intellectually kind of a snob. 
[00:14:00]  He's continuing to think he can outthink everybody, and he can fix this, and he can undo it, and he cannot.  And everybody knows he's lying, or was lying, and that's unfixable.  Hey, I also have a phone number, so at about 7 o'clock, we can try to get Breitbart on the phone.  Oh, I'd love to have Breitbart on.  Now, we sort of have the exclusive, in a way.  A little bit.  Because you're not really saying it, but we might have the exclusive. 
[00:14:30]  I'm not really saying anything, but, you know, you could connect the dots, I guess.  Safe to say, because you didn't tell me, but I'm trying to figure this out.  Safe to say there may be more pictures that are way worse than the bare-chested photo.  Yes.  Okay.  Yes.  Safe to say.  Safe to say that it's...  That was said at the news conference yesterday.  Yeah, I know, but safe to say that these things most likely will see the light of day.  I would say...  If you drunks are showing each other on a sidewalk in New York, guess what? 
[00:15:00]  Look, I don't know what people are saying, but to tell you the truth, in my personal opinion,  based on what I heard...  And I believe you didn't drink much last night, so, you know, bear with me.  I'm just trying to make it fun for the show.  But you drunks on a sidewalk in the middle of the night are showing each other.  You're probably showing fucking strangers at that point.  I would say that they're going to see the light of day.  I would say these pictures will definitely get out.  I can't see any way they wouldn't. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  If, you know...  Do you think...  Let me ask you.  Do you think that if there were photos like that existing, do you think Pete Bartlett  would sit on them just so Wiener didn't look bad?  Hell no.  I don't think so.  He wants to kill this guy for fucking Wiener trying to throw him under the bus.  I don't think there's any controlling this at this point.  I think these pictures will find their way out.  And I think especially Pelosi calling for this investigation.  I hate her, but I get this.  Do you think she's calling for an ethics... 
[00:16:00]  Does she almost have to?  Of course.  Yeah, she has to.  Whether you like her or not, that's part of her job.  She has to.  It doesn't matter what Wiener wants at this point.  It's what the Democrats want, and they want him fucking gone.  You know what sucks?  He's kind of a talented politician.  A young guy that was getting some things done, and now he's just completely done because  he didn't understand social networking and all that shit.  He just didn't understand it.  This would have come out...  The lie gets you.  This extent of stuff would have probably come out anyway. 
[00:16:30]  If not now, while he was running for mayor.  If not now, six months from now.  It was like I brilliantly pointed out on Hannah.  I mean, I think that what he was worried about was five steps down the road, so therefore  I said it on television.  The lie gets him.  So you heard that he had sex with Pink, or he told another...  Yeah, I heard that he told in messages...  So there are messages that state this.  Yeah, that he told that girl that he had sex with Pink, the singer, and tried to have 
[00:17:00]  sex with Madonna, but it didn't work for some reason.  So that makes sense as to why he would send her his hog in that PM, because they had spoken  many times.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't just send that out randomly.  This was more of a back and forth than he would like people to believe.  But he also knew that, in a way, he's like, why did he lie?  The lie gets you.  But with this one, he literally would have had to say, I've been having an online affair 
[00:17:30]  with this woman.  Yeah.  I've been emotionally cheating, if not physically.  And the can of worms was going to be open anyway.  There's no way the press wasn't going to go to her and ask for pictures.  During the press conference, he said he has not cheated on his wife.  Well, physically.  Physically, which is bullshit.  He's been known to lie before, so who the hell knows what...  I would have to say that is bullshit.  Bullshit.  But there's a lot of messages, a lot of girls, and a lot of pictures.  Hey, the picture, is it...  Or is it... 
[00:18:00]  Is it...  Or the...  Um...  I'm very close up.  Ah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Does it have a freckle on it?  I'm actually going to...  I actually...  I have a picture of my dick that I like so much.  I actually want to ask Breepard if I can text it to him and see if he'll put it up on...  I don't know.  He'll post it somewhere.  Eh, shit.  Wow.  So you had a hell of a night.  Oh, that was...  So the red-eyed thing was just, who cares?  That was a throwaway.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:18:30]  It was, you know...  Being on TV was a throwaway.  It was what happened afterwards.  It was fun.  The show was great.  Like, how do you not have a good time?  It was, um...  A comic, uh...  Jesse...  Uh...  Jesse Joyce?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's funny.  Jesse Joyce is funny, man.  Yeah, he's very good.  I got his number.  We should definitely give him a try on the show.  Yeah, yeah.  He used to write for Geraldo.  He's very funny.  Yeah, he's really funny.  And then, um...  Uh, Lloyd Webber, the girl.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, indigent.  Yeah, yeah.  Indigent.  She's, uh...  She's English. 
[00:19:00]  But she...  She was sick to her stomach with food poisoning.  Aw.  So, by, like, the last couple of segments, she had to actually leave.  During the segments, she left to puke and came back.  Oh, wow.  What a trooper.  Yeah, yeah.  You sure I was puking?  She was being a trooper.  She probably had watery diarrhea.  Nah, I think she was...  I'm just telling you guys it was puke.  There were a couple of times she kind of went...  Oh, really?  And had to, like, run out.  What had she eaten?  Did she say?  She said it was, uh, tuna sushi.  Tuna? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And she...  She's probably going to a bad place.  She got fucking...  Really fucked up.  But it was, uh...  There was so much wiener shit that you can't lose with that.  So, it was a really good red eye last night.  A lot of fun.  I was...  I was, uh...  Thinking to myself, like, God, of all the nights I would love to be on either Red Eye or Hannity.  I know.  That was just it.  That'd be a great night.  I walked into the lobby to go up, and Ann Coulter's waiting to go up to Hannity.  And she was having trouble at the desk and shit, because she's selling her book and stuff.  She wants to come on the show, too, to, uh...  Yeah, but we should get her on. 
[00:20:00]  Sell her book and shit.  Uh, but she was out there, and we were just talking to each other, like, phew, this is  an easy one.  No shit.  But she's like, you know, fuck this guy.  I'm trying to sell a goddamn book, and I'm gonna have to deal with this motherfucker.  I could have even done it.  This one's like a fucking home run, man.  It's fucking easy, man.  No brainer.  It's what you dream of.  You just pop on and talk about Wiener.  Here's the bullet points, really quickly.  Uh, Wiener admits to everything, says he intended to send pictures as a direct message.  That's what got him fucked.  As part of a joke?  Yeah, as part of a joke. 
[00:20:30]  That was like, yeah.  He's still lying.  It's a joke, by the way.  Could you joke and send me one back?  Right.  Yeah.  I'm gonna joke and jerk off to your pictures.  And the fact that I addressed that on CNN.com in my interview, it's not important.  Nice!  It's not, and who cares, Jim?  Wow.  What about me?  Am I done an interview on Skype?  Who cares?  Big deal.  Go to CNN.com and find it.  That's up to you people.  No.  You don't even have to.  Wait, there's audio?  We gotta play that on the show.  It's okay.  But once he realized it was out there, he deleted it in panic and told everyone his account was hacked because he was embarrassed. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Refuses to resign, saying he broke no law, but that's...  Doesn't matter.  Legally, maybe, you didn't break any laws, but ethically, his whole lying thing, this whole scandal, the Democrats do not want this.  If he came out right away...  See, that's why he doesn't understand social networking and all that.  When that first picture hit, he should have known, fuck, I'm done.  And then he should have done the press conference and did everything he did yesterday, and then maybe he would have a shot. 
[00:21:30]  Maybe.  Maybe.  Because it's hard for people to...  Once you...  But then again, this stuff would have kept coming out.  It's hard with sex shit because if you admit it right off the bat, everyone still wants to know, and the reporters are not going to go, well, he confessed.  Then they're going to go, let's get the juicy details.  And do you want to stand up there and say everything?  Yeah, but at least he doesn't have the lies to compare to the truth.  Do you want to sit there, though, and say, yeah, there's pictures, there's that, what kind of pictures? 
[00:22:00]  He had no choice.  Are there big, juicy cock pictures?  Or average cock pictures.  Or average cock pictures?  Are you erect?  He had no choice in the end.  Hysterical.  I heard about that.  Oh, God, that was funny.  What happened?  The guy from our show asked him if he was erect.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Were you erect in the pictures?  Were you erect?  That was Benji, and you know what?  Like I tweeted yesterday, funny is funny.  It's hilarious.  Congratulations to Benji, man.  It was hilarious.  What the fuck?  And I guess he was a fortune teller.  Of course he was fully erect. 
[00:22:30]  Dummy.  Refuses to resign.  Nancy Pelosi calls for an ethics inquiry into Anthony Weiner.  This guy's done.  Weiner claims he never had sex outside his marriage.  Bullshit!  I wonder.  Huh?  No proof of that or anything.  Yeah, there's no proof.  I just wonder, because the guy's lied before, so, you know, got a little choked up about that  when he's talking about his wife, you know?  Has had Twitter and Facebook relationships with up to six women.  This guy will not delete his Twitter, because he doesn't want to see those followers go away. 
[00:23:00]  What an idiot.  I grew up with two shaved balls and a dream to be.  Oh, boy, really?  A dream came true!  A United States representative!  A dream came true!  I, uh, where did he come from originally?  Yeah, where is he from originally?  God damn it, do you think?  He's a local.  Is he a New Yorker?  He's gotta be.  Came from somewhere with a crane nose.  Idiot.  Bare-chested photo.  Two-cat Sam face.  Bare-chested photo, but he leaves his big fucking nose in it. 
[00:23:30]  Snazzola hanging down.  I really, by the way, as this, it is getting later, I really do think a little acting with young Eric is in order.  Oh, wow, yeah, yeah.  Practice your lines, buddy.  Dialogue, yeah.  You should read, uh...  And, uh, who should play Weiner in this one?  I'd love to if I get a chance to talk Journey to E-Rock.  Oh.  Can you do a good Jew-y Jew?  Um, yes, I think I can.  Yeah.  I don't know, but I'm not married to the part.  If there's somebody better suited for it, I would avoid that. 
[00:24:00]  I would like to see you as the Jew-y Jew.  Uh, says some of these relationships dated back three years.  Says to the best of his knowledge, all the women were adults.  You hear that one broad?  I think that was, um...  How old?  How do you know?  Oh, no.  I think that was Pizer.  Was it?  Because her, she's killing him in the paper today.  Yeah.  I think it was Andrea Pizer.  Marriage heated for a crotch photo finish.  Because in her article, she talks about how young these women could have been.  Yeah.  That woman in the front row... 
[00:24:30]  They were young enough to be your goddess!  They were in college!  What are you talking...  What are you talking...  If you don't know their age, how do you know they were of age?  I don't!  With that horrible voice.  By the way, this...  I'm sorry, this would be the second young Democrat that New York has lost, uh, because of sexual  shit, like...  Yeah.  Spitzer...  And I don't, I don't care about either one of these guys, but when are we going to stop  judging politicians? 
[00:25:00]  Who cares?  If this guy's even cheating on his wife, who gives a shit?  You know what?  I don't...  I agree with you, but the lying leading up to this is what's killing them.  That's the big one.  As a politician, when you catch a politician lying, it's over, John.  It's a lie.  It's over fucking John.  The lie is their great excuse.  Did Clinton...  I don't remember anymore.  Did Clinton lie before he said all that shit to a grand jury?  I did not have sex with that woman.  That's why he got impeached.  He skated, though.  He got impeached, though, didn't he?  He's a powerful motherfucker to this day, though. 
[00:25:30]  He did get impeached.  But it's very hard to take a sitting president and throw them out of fucking office.  Believe me, if it was any other office and he had done that and lied like that, he'd have  been out.  You know what?  When he did the Monica Lewinsky thing, there was no Twitter or Facebook.  Could you imagine how close we were to seeing a presidential cocky?  That's...  I...  That's just...  Because you know damn well if he had Twitter or Facebook, he would have sent it somehow.  I was saying that last night, as a matter of fact, on Red Eye on Fox News, that we're 
[00:26:00]  living in this age where it's instant.  You can fuck your career up politically in an instant with Twitter and Facebook.  Although Clinton, I think they said sent...  I want to say one email while he was president.  He did not send emails.  Now, that could be wrong, but I remember he was not an email guy, and I think part of  me thinks he was almost too smart to put it in writing.  Maybe.  Clinton was a smart fucking dude.  Writing in jizz on a dress. 
[00:26:30]  That wasn't the brightest move.  Hello.  But he might not have known that was on there.  I think Clinton was too smart a dude to fucking do with this idiot.  Yeah, leave that trail.  Yeah, man.  He's not...  He was not a dumb guy.  I think our sperm is like glitter.  Yeah, it is.  It's like stripper glitter.  Stripper glitter.  Once that gets on you...  You hug someone, they have fucking sperm on them.  What the fuck?  What are you going to do?  Women were adults, to the best of his knowledge.  Andrew Breitbart claims to have one photo that he is holding back to save Wiener's family.  Yeah. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Not holding back too well if half of Times Square saw it last night at three in the morning.  He's doing a great job of holding it back.  I will give him that.  He really is.  To save Wiener's family.  Yeah.  Save the family.  Radar Online and Star has more than 200 Facebook messages between Wiener and a single mother  from Texas who was interviewed by ABC.  Is that Lisa Weiss?  No, she's from Nevada.  Jesus.  I really...  40-year-old blackjack dealer from Vegas. 
[00:27:30]  This is the one that we're going to read in a second.  Said she had a nine-month sexting relationship with Wiener and claims he used a government phone  to have phone sex with her.  Yeah.  He's done.  He's done.  That bastard's in good shape, though.  Holy mackerel.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no body fate.  Body fate.  Body fat.  What kind of chest presses are you doing?  He's done.  He's so done.  It looks like he's wearing one of those plastic fucking Ben-Hur outfits.  It doesn't even look like a real man's chest.  Like a breastplate.  Yeah, a breastplate. 
[00:28:00]  Spartacus.  Let's do a little bit of play acting.  Oh, no.  We got to go press conference first.  We got the Wiener press conference.  We got Breitbart taking over the press conference.  And then we got Ant talking to Breitbart about Homeless Charlie.  So that we can save for a little later.  I actually didn't hear Breitbart take over the press conference.  All right.  Let's listen to that.  He walked in.  He was actually across the street.  And he was supposed to do some kind of interview.  So he came out of nowhere.  It didn't pan out.  Someone called him and said, by the way, Wiener's giving a press conference right here at the Sheridan across the street. 
[00:28:30]  And the mics are all set up.  Why don't you come in?  And he went, all right.  So he came by just to check it out.  And the press, like, swooped on him.  They put mics in front of his face.  And then someone said, why don't you go to the podium?  Wow.  And he's like, all right.  He steps right up to Wiener's podium and took over and opened the press conference.  He was the opening act.  He was the opening act.  I said it was like when Jimi Hendrix opened for the Monkees.  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  It was like that big moment where it's like, wow, that's a double bill you never thought you'd see.  So it was Breitbart.  Wow.  And he just really, he was funny.  It was very natural, too.  It wasn't like he was reading something.  He was just kind of like, yeah, this is this.  That's a moment of opportunity that he took.  And Breitbart, he broke the acorn scandal.  He's broken a lot of these.  Oh, yeah.  This one, I think, really made him a famous guy, though.  Yeah, this put him right over the top.  Where drudges. 
[00:29:30]  Because he would feed him drudge for a long time.  Yep.  Now, Breitbart's becoming pretty huge.  I asked him last night.  I was like, I go, I said, you are so under the gun with these people.  I go, is there anything that they could grab on you?  I go, have you done anything over the years that there's pictures of or anything?  Because you know they're going to be looking at every skeleton in your closet.  And he goes, not a goddamn thing.  Not one thing.  Wow.  Because all I'm thinking is they have to be, there has to be professional investigators looking into his shit. 
[00:30:00]  Although, I don't know if they, like, is he really, even if they got him on that, on a personal level, they want to fuck him over.  Yeah, you're fired.  There are some powerful people that want to fuck him over and make him look bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, apparently, he says, you know, there's nothing that they could.  Here's him at the press conference.  So, obviously, he's the guy that broke this whole thing.  Yeah.  And then Wiener tried to throw him under the bus. 
[00:30:30]  So, he showed up at, showed up at Wiener's press conference and took it over.  Fine, how do you do?  Let's get into this.  Do you know how much Wiener must have been backstage panicking when he's like, oh, look.  Someone came back and said, look, I don't know what happened, but Breitbart's on the mic.  Yeah, yeah.  And he must have just been like, what?  What?  He should have just left.  Said, I'm going to reschedule this fucking thing.  That would have looked bad, too.  Wow, he just got fucked.  He just stepped up and fucking took over.  I mean, if he's going to come up here and take some form of culpability here, he was party to a campaign for 72 hours that weekend 
[00:31:00]  to allow for the left-wing blogosphere, including the Daily Kost, to accuse me of being the hacker.  Right.  Are there any repercussions for journalism on the left when they falsely claim that I'm the hacker?  Marcus Milicis of the Daily Kost will not apologize.  In fact, he admitted that he named the girls, the underage girls, because they had the wrong politics. 
[00:31:30]  At what point does Meet the Press say we're no longer going to allow Marcus Milicis on the air?  Why is there no accountability for an entire weekend of false reporting that was based upon what I believe was Congressman Wiener's strategy to blame the messenger?  Abso-fucking-lutely.  And he's naming names.  He's completely right, about the media at least.  Good.  They were looking at him, especially the hard left, were looking at him like, oh, you set up this guy, you're the hacker, you're the one that came up with this fake email account and all this, 
[00:32:00]  and it turned out, no, Wiener did it, did it all, and Breepart reported it, and a lot of these news agencies and stuff won't pull back and say, oh, wow, we fucked up.  How many people saw that picture that you haven't said?  I don't know.  That one picture.  What, the one with his bare chest?  Well, the one where Ann Coulter's mouth is agape. 
[00:32:30]  Ann Coulter's mouth is agape?  That could be any picture.  No, I know.  That could have been the one with the no shirt or the one with the cat.  You see the one with the cat?  That's a good one.  Oh, hey, the two pussies, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the two pussies.  The two what, Jimmy?  The two pussies.  Oh, I have an egg in my mouth.  I can't say it, I'll be, well, you'll all be wearing an egg hat.  If you said it properly, here's more, Andrew Breepart.  Oh, there might have been a police captain that looked, too.  That's what I'm saying.  A couple of firemen. 
[00:33:00]  I don't know.  A couple of homeless guys in Times Square.  Whatever.  Like in Elmo, as he's getting out of his costume.  Who else saw this fucking thing?  Jesus.  How about you keep it under your hat?  But if you have something like that, man, you just show the world.  How do you not?  Sorry, yes, Jimmy.  It's a photo of two cats, and it's not even a handsome photo, and he goes,  Wiener poses with his cats in a photo he called, me and the pussies. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, he is fucking in deep trouble.  He's done.  He really looks, he looks like a psychopath in these photos.  Yeah.  These are not sexy photos.  They're not sexy.  He looks like a lunatic.  Yeah, he's a kook.  Yeah.  Jon Stewart's friend, huh?  Roommate in college, I think, right?  I guess Jon Stewart stopped talking about it.  No, he, he, they showed a clip on MSNBC this morning.  He handled it pretty well.  From last night?  Yeah, he was fucking around with it.  He was?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  He was deeply depressed, and then goes, well, now I'm going to turn to this camera over here 
[00:34:00]  and talk about something else.  It was...  Oh, okay.  He actually handled it pretty well, knowing that it's his friend, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  What are you going to do?  That's got to be a tough, tough position to be in, but...  More Breitbart from the press conference before Wiener talked.  I have, I want to hear the truth.  I want to hear the truth from Congressman Wiener.  Quite frankly, I'd like an apology for him being complicit...  He gets one.  ...and he blamed the messenger strategy.  That was clear what happened.  72 hours in Palm Springs with your family is excruciating when you are being challenged. 
[00:34:30]  Andrew, why aren't you on vacation?  Why won't you get off the phone?  Because I'm being accused of being the hacker against a congressman.  He said nothing.  He allowed for that to go.  His minions perpetuated that false, malicious meme, and then he went on CNN to attack me.  I feel he was complicit.  Yeah, that's where it gets fucking creepy.  The whole media is listening to that.  But what he's saying is almost irrefutable.  Yes.  Oh, that's a great... 
[00:35:00]  This is something you almost never see.  The moment of vindication.  You never see a guy...  Because the media does this shit all the time.  And you never see the guy get to stand up there and go,  this guy messed up, this guy messed up, and this guy messed up.  Right.  That's a really lucky thing he got to do.  It's an amazing...  I was calling it a movie moment.  You don't see this happen in real life.  Is Breitbart a nice guy?  Yeah, he's a pisser.  Yeah, is he?  He's a fucking pisser.  He seems like he would be.  I've done red-eye with him a bunch of times. 
[00:35:30]  I like...  Oh, this is why I mentioned CNN.  Because one of the questions they ask me is, like, do you like Andrew Breitbart?  Yeah.  They ask you that.  Yeah.  Yeah, why not?  Fun guy.  I like him.  Give him that.  All right, we...  Oh, wow.  I'm not going to be a target.  Pink just gave birth the other day.  Oh, yeah?  According to...  They have a big schnoz.  Yeah, exactly.  Cath Co.  From the Jersey Shore.  Measure its schnoz.  Schnozola.  Did it look like the leader in that Woody Allen movie?  Just the nose?  Remember the nose was on a plate?  If all the rumors are true, then she better hope that it's not Wiener's baby. 
[00:36:00]  Because that nose will do damage coming out.  Yes.  It's tough enough delivering the head, and then you've got a nose on top of it like that?  That's pretty bad.  Your baby's wearing a dunce hat.  Oh, wait.  Sorry.  It's in front of his face.  Yeah.  It's coming out nose first.  All right.  Press conference time.  So then, what, around 4 o'clock yesterday, more or less?  Yeah, about that.  Wiener steps to the microphone.  And we said all this was coming last week.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  Thank you very much for being here, and good afternoon.  I'd like to take this time to clear up some of the questions that have been raised over  the past 10 days or so, and take full responsibility for my actions.  At the outset, I'd like to make it clear that I have made terrible mistakes that have hurt  the people I care about the most, and I'm deeply sorry.  I have not been honest with myself, my family, my constituents, my friends, and supporters,  and the media.  Last Friday night, I tweeted a photograph of myself that I intended to send as a direct 
[00:37:00]  message as part of a joke to a woman in Seattle.  Stop.  Shut up.  Stop.  More lies, you idiot.  He's still, in the middle of all this shit, he's still lying.  That was not a joke.  Where's the joke part?  Yeah, what's the joke?  Yeah, exactly.  There's the punchline.  Is he saying two Jews walk into a bar and showing, like, counting himself and his penises  too?  That there's no joke there?  No.  No joke. 
[00:37:30]  You sent it, fine.  But don't act like it was an LOL moment.  It wasn't part of a joke.  No one laughs while they're jerking off.  You never hear that.  Ha ha ha ha.  You're pumping your engorged cock.  Hardy har.  On the government phone.  You might have been pre-com all over your fucking BlackBerry numbers.  No one is LOLing.  I think serial killers, LOL, when they're jerking off over a dead fucking body.  Yeah, but that's not the sexual part.  They're just thinking of the last thing the victim said.  Like, they made them laugh because the victim said something stupid. 
[00:38:00]  Like, my shoes are...  They just got it.  It's a joke.  To a woman in Seattle.  Once I realized I had posted it to Twitter, I panicked.  I took it down and said that I had been hacked.  I then continued with that story, to stick to that story.  Why?  Which was a hugely regrettable mistake.  He's creepy, man.  It's a lie, yeah.  And I'll say it again.  This is normal shit that people do, but something about him, it's creepy.  It's creepy.  There's some creepiness going on here. 
[00:38:30]  Wiener confirmed...  Whatever, we could just play it.  To be clear, the picture was of me, and I sent it.  I'm deeply sorry for the pain this has caused by my wife, Huma, and our family.  What is the emotion about?  It's not about his wife.  It's about, he's thinking, holy shit, my career's over.  I'm done.  Yeah.  He's not crying for his wife.  He breaks up every time he mentions his wife.  He's not crying for his relationship.  No way.  But I don't think so.  Although in that moment, your wife is the only thing you have, and you realize right at that 
[00:39:00]  moment, you're publicly humiliating your wife.  And she wasn't by his side.  I was going to say, noticeably absent.  It wasn't one of those situations where, you know, stand by me and give me that dumb wife  look at the side of the podium.  You know, you know at that moment.  She wasn't going to be Silda.  Just standing there looking like an idiot.  Or McGreevy's wife.  Oh, God.  Or McGreevy's wife, right?  Well, he admitted that not only does he like Dick, but he enjoys balls almost as much. 
[00:39:30]  I am a gay American.  She's like, huh?  This beard with the pussy right next to me.  Did you really?  What did McGreevy just attack his wife?  Do you really think I enjoyed licking that thing?  Jim, didn't you notice every time I went below your belly button, I went, like the Lloyd  Webber girl?  I'm standing next to this buzzkill.  I'm standing next to this cockless monster.  Didn't you notice that while I was licking your vagina, I kept yelling, where is it? 
[00:40:00]  I'll find it.  For Pete's sake.  Jiggling imaginary balls.  Exactly.  Didn't you notice that you kept saying, Jim, why are you tickling midair about four inches  below my vagina lips?  Wishful thinking.  Didn't you wonder why I was going, hoody, hoody, hoody, with nothing there, you goose?  And my constituents, my friends, supporters, and staff. 
[00:40:30]  In addition, over the past few years, I have engaged in several inappropriate conversations  conducted over Twitter, Facebook, email, and occasionally on the phone with women I  have met online.  Conducted over all means of communication known to men, with the exception of carrier  prisoners.  Email.  Email, Facebook, Morse code, smoke signals, World War II field radios, CB. 
[00:41:00]  There really is no way that he didn't jerk off.  I love this guy.  Oh, Watson, come quick, I need you.  Come, quick, come quick, get it?  Facebook, email, and occasionally on the phone with women I have met online.  I've exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three  years.  For the most part, these communications took place before my marriage, though some have 
[00:41:30]  sadly took place after.  To be clear, I have never met any of these women or had physical relationships at any  time.  Do you think he was low-balling the numbers?  I don't know.  I would say he's low-balling the numbers.  With him coming up to the podium, and within the first 30 seconds saying that it was sent  as a joke, which is another lie, then I have to doubt all of his testimony at the podium 
[00:42:00]  there.  Of course.  I think everything is a lie.  Fuck, what happens to this guy?  A lie.  He gets on TV like Spitzer eventually?  Yeah, they probably put him together.  They put him with Spitzer.  Oh my God.  And you have a little show with a couple of politicians that tripped over their own cocks  to the...  Spitzer is...  On their way to fame and glory.  He's unwatchable, by the way.  Yeah.  Un-fucking-watchable.  Yeah, it is.  His delivery just sucks.  And they got rid of the other, the chick.  Yeah, they thought...  Making Matt was the problem. 
[00:42:30]  They thought the chick was the problem, but he just sucks.  His delivery's horrible.  He's the problem.  He's kind of monotone.  The Wienermobile.  Yeah, the late night talk guy's having a field day with this one.  Yeah.  Roasting Wiener on late night.  Oh, is he done?  He's so done.  He's a joke.  I haven't told the truth.  And I've done things that I deeply regret.  Boo!  Fake tears, fake tears. 
[00:43:00]  I brought pain to people I care about the most.  The people who believed in me.  This is the eatman after our last contract.  And for that, I'm deeply sorry.  I apologize to my wife.  Yeah, he sent a picture of a French horn wrapped in a napkin.  And he's embarrassed.  He has to come out and admit that he has sent photos of French horns to other women.  I've bored at least six different women.  I've bungled at least six different contract negotiations.  I have inappropriately handled six different radio people's contracts in the last couple of years. 
[00:43:30]  I want to apologize to everyone who paid me a commission that I should have fucking gone to jail for accepting.  You're going to get me crying now.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Oh, shit.  I want to apologize to you.  Oh, my God.  Officially not Super Agent Bob Eatman anymore.  Aw.  No.  We'll call him not so super.  No.  He's fucking...  He's a super bug in Europe is what he is.  He's...  Is this a germ?  Of course there is. 
[00:44:00]  He's a germ.  He's officially...  He's officially mediocre Agent Bob Eatman.  Oh.  At best.  Damn.  To my wife and our families.  As well as to our friends and supporters.  I'm deeply ashamed of my terrible judgment and actions.  I'll be glad to take any questions that you might have.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Dude.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Fucking...  That's when he should have...  Oswald didn't get questions like that thrown at him when they were leading him from the fucking  one office to the other. 
[00:44:30]  I've never seen questions fired so fast.  Flying out.  Question, question, statement, question, question, question, statement.  Question, send me call, exclamation point, question, mark, comma.  Comma, question, mark, statement, question, what?  I've got a vagina, penis.  Six, a Seattle girl.  Tits, breasts, wife, Silda.  Spencer.  Breitbart, breasts, you.  Trouble, lie.  Resign, leave.  Jon Stewart, go home.  Quick.  In trouble.  They really did shoot him out at us.  Dude.  Why would you...  There was nothing.  Why would you take questions?  Oh, God.  Especially in that. 
[00:45:00]  Get out of there.  I know.  Have a statement and leave.  You said everything you need to say.  Statement and leave.  Let them fucking think and try to figure the rest out.  You said a lot there.  He...  But I'm saying, he loves the spotlight.  Yeah.  He knew all cameras were on him, and he's like, fuck it, I'll go with this.  Yeah.  What a...  Well, that's hilarious, Jimmy.  He...  Yeah, he got a lot of questions fired at him.  What's TMZ saying about a porn star?  Wiener told porn star to lie.  Probably Ginger Lynn.  Offered PR help, TMZ, dot com.  I'm guessing Ginger Lynn.  Were you thinking Arba Dwyer when he walked up to that podium? 
[00:45:30]  I know a lot of people were tweeting that yesterday.  He looked...  He walked up there, and when he reached for the water that he just kept suckling on, I  was thinking like, oh, God, that looks like an Arba Dwyer moment.  We should have tried to get her on...  You know what?  We should have tried to get her on the show.  We've had Ginger on before.  We've had Ginger on.  Allegations?  That he tried to ask her to lie.  But why is she...  Allegated?  You can't trust anybody, man.  No.  Hey, Seth in Illinois writes, Opie, you gotta mention your new video about the crack-smoking  yoga instructor with a Benz who can't handle a $60 ticket. 
[00:46:00]  That's not important right now.  We're talking about Anthony Wiener.  You want more of the press conference?  Oh, who wouldn't?  I came here to accept the full responsibility for what I've done.  Well, that's the woman with the horrible voice in the front row talking about the age  of the women.  Now, I want to know if that was Andrea Pizer. 
[00:46:30]  Was she there?  Yeah, yeah, she was there.  Do you realize how young these women are?  She is a nudge.  They could be your daughters.  Gonna send your dick pictures to old women.  Stop.  You know what I realized?  I can't do the New York accent anymore.  No?  We're fucking born and raised in this area.  But did radio elsewhere and it fucked up our accents.  That's where women...  I want an old school New York accent today.  I can't get it done.  That's where women are fucking idiots.  Like, do you realize how young...  What kind of a dumb, jealous old lady question is that? 
[00:47:00]  Right.  Stop with that shit.  That's a...  Every guy wants to fuck younger women.  I hate to break it to you.  You don't tweet your dick pics to old women.  Sorry.  No guy is thrilled.  Unless you're younger and you like older women,  no 48-year-old guy goes,  I can't wait to go home and fuck my 40-year-old wife  or my 38-year-old wife.  But, you know, 22-year-old...  Here's my cock.  ...college.  Yeah.  Here's my cock pic.  Here, quick.  I can't fucking get it to you quickly enough. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  I came here to accept the full responsibility for what I've done.  I...  Shudders.  I am deeply regretting what I have done,  and I am not resigning.  I have made it clear that I accept responsibility for this,  and people who draw conclusions about me are free to do so.  And I've worked for the people of my district for 13 years  and in politics for 20 years, 
[00:48:00]  and I hope that they see fit to see this in the light that it is,  which is a deeply regrettable mistake.  Oh, boy.  In no time, you're going to hear,  for the good of the party.  Yeah, so because...  To prevent further distraction...  Right.  ...from doing what people were elected to do...  Yeah.  ...because if Ginger Lynn...  Everybody wants press with something like that.  Yeah.  For a politician to do this stuff in this day and age,  you're so dumb.  They all fucking blab.  Oh, yap. 
[00:48:30]  The beauty of comedians is nobody wants to admit  they've talked dirty to us.  That's the beauty of us.  Nobody gives a shit.  No one cares.  No one cares.  Right.  Well, we've got to discuss this for a second.  There's a new culture where everyone needs to talk.  Yeah, people love having a voice.  Everyone has a voice.  It sort of started with Tiger Woods, right?  No, before that.  It was before that.  Who started it then?  It started with the advent of all these fucking abilities  of people to get their word across in an instant.  Blogging, Facebook... 
[00:49:00]  Tiger Woods definitely pushed it big time forward  where the women decided,  oh, I'm going to fucking babble.  I don't think anybody started it.  Babble.  Look at Clinton and Lewinsky.  I mean, I don't know if she talked,  but Linda Tripp talked.  Well, Linda Tripp talked  because she was a jealous broad.  Yeah, big fat pig, but still.  Big fat pig getting in the way of  something that had nothing to do with her.  Trying to see if somebody else can come up with a name,  but they're saying Bill Clinton and...  No, man.  Tiger pushed it forward, but...  The blabbing girls. 
[00:49:30]  The blabbing girls.  Where was the blabbing...  I think the quantity of blabbing girls...  The girls used to not blab.  ...was Tiger.  Tiger definitely had the quantity of blabbing girls.  Before that, I mean...  You know, we've known that people in the public eye  have been doing this forever.  Yeah.  But the blabbing girls,  that wasn't something that was out there.  Yeah, they usually kept their mouths shut  or no one would pay attention to them, I guess.  I don't know.  But now, I mean,  they run to these girls  and these girls can't fucking...  Because they want their fame, too.  Uh-huh. 
[00:50:00]  But this porn star thing fucking puts it over the top.  I'll tell you who it happened with,  started to Jessica Hahn.  Even though she wasn't multiple,  she talked, she got fame...  But that's a long time ago.  That's what I'm saying, of course.  Yeah, that was before any social media.  But this has moved forward big time.  There were always women  that were blabbing here and there,  but in general,  they kept their mouths shut.  But now, none of them are keeping their mouths shut.  This is one of these every fucking week, it seems like.  They love yapping.  Also, part of it is now with social networking, 
[00:50:30]  you can connect with so many people so fast.  15 years ago, even,  you could connect with somebody...  I mean, again,  Clinton could probably fuck who he wants,  whatever he wants,  but you still have to be on the phone with them or whatever.  You couldn't immediately send out proof that you're guilty.  In this one,  text email, text email, picture text, text...  You're finished.  But back then, it's only his word against her word,  so it wasn't as easy to get them to talk.  Remember...  Because they had no proof.  Remember Gary Hart with the monkey business,  the boat?  Sure.  And there were pictures of him sitting, 
[00:51:00]  with a girl sitting on his lap,  and, you know,  that, obviously,  way before pictures could be sent to everybody.  And who was it?  That wasn't Jennifer Flowers,  was Clinton.  That was, um...  Yeah.  Not Fawn Hall.  Was that Fawn Hall?  No, Fawn Hall, I think.  It was Oliver North.  Ollie, yeah.  Um, who the fuck was Gary?  Don't...  Who was Monkey Business?  Somebody will know in a second who that, uh...  Donna.  Donna Rice.  Donna Rice, right?  Donna Rice.  Donna Rice.  She was pretty hot.  That's right.  I didn't like her because she had so many carbs. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, no.  But, like, look at those pictures.  There he is.  Donna Rice on his lap,  and, uh...  It's just...  And that was before the internet.  Look at this,  Andy and Gary Hardy.  He's like,  hi, she has nice legs, all right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She was all right.  That's why I take it with a regular camera  to get that developed.  Oh, yeah.  It had to go to the, you know,  the photo match.  That's another thing,  is back then,  in a moment,  you couldn't snap a photo  and have 50 copies of it.  And have it all over the place.  It was just a different world  even 15 years ago  with this type of stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, I still find it strange 
[00:52:00]  that you could take a picture,  tweet it,  and within moments,  give it 10, 15 minutes,  there's a couple thousand people  that have already seen the picture.  That's so weird to me still.  You look and you see  like 5,000 people have checked it out.  Just like that.  10,000 people have checked it out.  But quickly.  I just took this picture.  Yeah, within a day,  it's 10,000 easy.  In our world,  you know,  other celebrities,  it goes a lot higher than that,  but...  Amazing.  The press conference continues.  Do you have anything  to say to Andrew Breitbart?  I'm deeply apologetic,  first and foremost, 
[00:52:30]  to my wife,  to the many people  that put so much faith  and confidence in me  that watched me make this  terrible mistake.  But everyone  that I misled,  everyone in the media,  my staff,  the people that I  lied to about this,  they all deserve an apology.  Hey, um...  Did I play the clip  about him  talking about resigning?  Did I fuck that up?  The opening clip you played,  I'm not resigning.  He said he's not resigning, yeah.  Did I play this one?  Hold on.  It's quick.  I came here to accept  the full responsibility 
[00:53:00]  for what I've done.  Oh yeah,  that was when they were all battling.  And he said,  I'm not resigning.  And then finally, uh...  Question, question.  Oh yeah, yeah.  Question, statement,  design, disquipment.  Question, moralizing,  statement, design, disquipment.  Question, question.  Genuine question.  Nosy question.  Dirty tabloid question.  That really doesn't mean  anything for the news.  Question, exclamation point.  Point, point, sir.  Here, thank you, sir.  Question, we got it.  Fucking vultures.  And then finally,  the press conference  ends with, uh, this.  Uh, this is Benji 
[00:53:30]  from the Howard Stern show.  Oh yeah.  Fucking made me laugh.  Big time.  They were inappropriate.  They were part of a,  of consensual, you know,  exchanges of emails.  And I don't want to violate  the privacy of the,  the women who were involved.  But it was clearly a mistake  and one that I deeply regret.  Thank you.  You're in the grave.  Thank you.  Were you fully a wreck?  What made you decide?  Were you fully a wreck?  Or were you killed?  Anthony Weiner,  taking any and all questions,  taking full responsibility  for having mistakenly 
[00:54:00]  published a picture  of his penis on Twitter.  Why can't Dopey News Guy  that now is, you know,  interrupting it  and stopping it?  Well, the press conference  ends and they go back  to the studio.  Dopey News Guy  can't have a laugh there  like, holy crap,  that's funny?  I saw one news guy  with a little notebook  and he was writing  when they panned around  that was laughing his ass off.  The, the,  all the news guys there  were laughing.  Of course.  But, you know,  on, on camera  you gotta be all nice.  All right.  Wow. 
[00:54:30]  Hilarious.  We're, we're only getting started.  When we get back,  we'll, we'll do the transcript.  Jimmy's gonna play  Anthony Weiner  and, um,  good old Eric.  E-Rock is gonna play  Linda Weiss.  Wait, should I do it?  Lisa Weiss.  Ridiculous.  Bulge in my shorts now,  wanna see?  Oh boy.  No, not good.  Oh boy.  I'll work on it.  Work on it.  Florentine at 8 o'clock  and later on this morning,  the great Sugar Ray Leonard.  Yes.  That's right.  Some say the greatest boxer  of all time.  One of them.  And I have many questions 
[00:55:00]  for him.  Question, question, question,  question, boxing.  Did you ever get hurt  by a punch?  You did.  It's like,  it's like our interview yesterday.  It's great.  With Don.  Yeah, with the,  the Jimmy Youngster questions.  Do you like the fact  that gloves are red?  I'm gonna get to the bottom  of this guy. 
[00:55:30]  Why are gloves red?  Have they ever answered  that question?  I don't know.  They just picked red  out of nowhere?  I see all the nasty blood  on them, maybe.  I'm guessing because  back when boxing started,  and this is my guess,  if I don't even know,  actually I don't know  how long they've been  using red gloves,  but I'm guessing  it's this way you could  always see where the gloves are  and there's no other color  that's red.  Why not go with like  fluorescent orange?  Probably didn't have  that back then.  Yeah, and red is  just such a powerful  statement.  Punch, and you don't  want to see blood  all over the gloves.  Yeah.  It'll be kind of morbid.  Yeah, maybe. 
[00:56:00]  Troy is trying something new,  so we'll play this  going into break.  What, doing some good  work while he's here?  When we get back,  Anthony talked to  Breitbart on the streets  of Manhattan last night.  Oh, yes.  Late last night.  And we'll play those clips  and we'll do a transcript.  And we'll eat some treats  during the break.  Oh, yeah, I want to  explain the treats  after the break, too.  But first this.  And now it's time for Greg Opie-Hughes  to ask another  uncomfortable question. 
[00:56:30]  Today's guest,  founder of West Coast  Choppers,  and former husband,  Cassandra Bullock,  Jesse James.  Did you like the blind side?  I got to ask.  Who told you to ask that?  No, I swear no one.  Why?  Is there something there  I didn't...  No, I don't know.  I just seemed a little  out of character for you.  I mean, I don't really know you,  but I was kind of out of the blue.  I'm just thinking stuff.  Because I'm thinking like,  wow, how...  I can go if you guys are bored.  No, no, no.  No, no, no. 
[00:57:00]  No.  Wasn't that awkward?  Stay tuned for another  uncomfortable question  from Greg Opie-Hughes  here on The Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus.  Get in touch with  The Opie and Anthony Show.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Send your feedback  to feedback  at opieandanthony.com  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, boy, what a day. 
[00:57:30]  It stays like today.  I love doing radio.  Yeah.  It's easy with this  Anthony Wiener thing.  That's exactly...  I couldn't have been happier  to have done Red Eye last night.  Perfect day to do it.  It was one of those days  where it's like,  please, got to come up with...  You know, they usually  send an email  and they say,  yeah, give us a few notes  on the topics.  And email them back  so, you know,  Greg knows what to ask  and Andy and stuff like that. 
[00:58:00]  And I pretty much just wrote,  really?  Are you kidding?  Like, the press conference  is happening  as I'm supposed to be  writing some shit.  I'm like,  this is a work in progress.  It writes itself.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't worry, I'll wing it.  I'll wing it.  And then I think  there was a little...  There was a little controversy  with my closing thing last night,  you know,  where Andy asks a question  and you've got to kind of answer,  you know.  They cut it out?  No, no.  But I got an email back  that was kind of like,  well, 
[00:58:30]  the Casey Anthony trial thing,  a little sensitive,  and I'm like,  I didn't talk about the kid,  I was talking about her  and how she's a white,  trash, lying psychopath  that I would absolutely  have at my house  if she wasn't up  for capital murder.  What's wrong with that?  It wasn't, apparently,  because I did say it  and it went through, so...  But what's wrong  with saying that?  I think they were  having a little problem  at Fox in general  with any type of humor  done with a child murderess.  So they were that. 
[00:59:00]  But there was also  a Naomi Campbell story  that we never got to  that she was suing Cadbury  because Cadbury  had an ad campaign  that said,  move over Naomi,  there's a new diva,  and she said it was racist.  Oh, God.  Yeah, she put the race card on it.  So, um...  How is that racist?  I have no fucking idea.  No one knows.  She's a fucking bitch  that throws shit  at the help  and punches people  and has been taken to court  for physical abuse of people. 
[00:59:30]  And she's, you know,  calling Cadbury...  And Cadbury's representatives  apologized to her.  So I was like,  ah, you know what?  I said, well,  something like  ten lashes  with a wet Twizzler.  And they were like,  well, you know,  she's black  and whipping black people  even though it's licorice.  But it's a Twizzler.  Yeah, the joke is the Twizzler.  It's not like, you know...  Actually, you could do some damage  with a Twizzler.  Yeah, you probably could.  And by the way,  Twizzlers suck.  I love Twizzlers. 
[01:00:00]  Do you really?  Fresh ones.  They can't be hard.  What's wrong with you?  Yuck.  Twizzlers suck.  No, Twizzlers are good.  They have a big Twizzlers sign  in Times Square.  Yeah.  They're advertising Twizzlers.  I love the Twizzler.  You like Twizzlers, Jimmy?  Love them.  I like a Twizzler.  I love a good Twizzler.  Really?  When I used to stay  at the Park of Meridian,  they would put a Twizzler  in a little vase.  A couple of Twizzlers.  And you'd go in your room  and it was like,  ooh, a treat.  I don't like the cherry ones.  I don't like the strawberry.  No, they've got to be  the original flavor.  The original strawberry.  Strawberry Twizzler. 
[01:00:30]  They give you Twizzlers  instead of a nice piece of chocolate?  We're taking your calls.  Twizzlers are chocolates.  It's got to be chocolate  every time when you stay in a hotel.  I don't want the chocolate.  And a maid that'll suck your cock.  Right.  That's right.  Or at least is afraid  of a right hook.  He's apparently in a sofa tell.  One no tuck, Lupe.  Did you read the article,  most guys when they're on the road  expect sex with their room service?  What?  Did you read this article?  Most guys? 
[01:01:00]  Yes, it came out yesterday.  Who wrote that one?  Most guys are expecting  something to happen  when they order room service.  Are you sure you don't have to be part  of an international monetary?  No?  It was a pretty good article.  Is that the article?  You expect sex with your maid service?  When you check into a hotel?  They said room service,  but I think they're talking in general. 
[01:01:30]  It's always some guy  that brings the food up for room service.  It's very rare.  It's a woman.  I still howl at those videos  of the guy that calls room service  or the maid.  Jerk off guy.  And then he's just jerking off  as she opens the door.  It's the best gag.  You set up a camera  next to the bed  so you can see the bed  and the door  of the hotel room.  You call up a maid  that you need towels  or room service or something.  You leave your door open.  Unlocked.  Unlocked.  And then you just start jacking off  and the woman walks in 
[01:02:00]  and sees you jacking  and she's like,  and close the door real fast.  It's like fucking  candid camera  with a fucking cock.  We saw those videos a while ago.  They're fucking funny.  It's fucking hilarious.  Jimmy, you ready to play Wiener?  Yes, I am.  Anthony Wiener.  March 16th Facebook message  exchanged with middle-aged  Nevada Democratic volunteer  Lisa Weiss.  And is Iraq playing Weiss?  Yes.  You want to play it from there?  Or you want to be nice  and close to Jimmy? 
[01:02:30]  Vice Angel.  Iraq.  Oh, um,  wherever you guys want to do it.  You should come in.  Yeah, come in.  Join the party  and have a puff, by the way.  Remember that place  I was talking about  yesterday on the show?  Yeah.  What's it called?  I went there for you guys.  Beard Papa's?  Beard Papa's, yeah.  A bunch of Japanese women  run this place, I think.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, geez.  Full release cream puffs?  Yeah, exactly.  And then you pick out your shell  and then they shove this thing in it  and put the cream in 
[01:03:00]  right there on the spot.  Mmm, mmm.  It's delicious.  It does look delicious.  You like them, Jimmy?  They're delicious.  I had wine.  It was very good.  I won't have another one.  You gotta try the strawberry one.  Nah, one is good.  One is good.  Iraq, can we hear  your girl's voice?  Oh, boy.  Ah, okay.  Don't read one of the lines,  just in general.  Yeah.  Just a greeting.  A morning greeting.  Good morning, how are you?  Oh, wow.  Is that sexy enough  for this play acting?  Oh, yeah.  Definitely, yeah. 
[01:03:30]  You're not sexy enough  for anything.  I got a bit of a chubby one.  Give him my number.  All right, Wiener started this  back and forth on Facebook.  Yeah.  Let me get some water.  Jimmy as Wiener.  Iraq as Weiss.  I love play acting.  Ridiculous bulging my shorts now.  Wanna see?  That's his independent statement.  Yes.  That's great.  It's a caricature.  That's his inspiration.  I hope he said he wanted it  very, very stereotypically Jewish. 
[01:04:00]  That is true.  I was looking for a Jewish.  Okay, let's do it again.  Ridiculous bulging my shorts now.  Wanna see?  Yeah, can you send me a pic?  I want to sit on your cock  so bad right now.  Jeez, I'm rushing.  Let me take a quick pic.  Awesome.  How do I get it?  Right on here?  How are you gonna go?  No, that's...  Somebody forgot her lines.  Oh, yeah, you got two lines in a row there. 
[01:04:30]  Sure, back up a little bit.  Miss Missy.  Jeez, I'm rushing.  Let me take a quick pic.  Awesome.  How do I get it?  Right on here?  How are you gonna go to work  with a raging hard-on?  It won't go away now.  And now I'm taking pics of it,  making me hotter still.  So hot.  You are making me wet again.  Jeez, I have to go.  I'll hit you later.  Off to the shower? 
[01:05:00]  This thing is a bobbing up and down.  Wish I was in the shower to help.  Wish I was in the shower with you to help.  You give good hand?  I've been told really good.  And I love doing it.  Wow!  A Jewish girl who sucks dick?  This thing is ready to do damage.  Holy shit.  That was like a Nazi propaganda poster. 
[01:05:30]  Holy shit.  I love it.  Oh, I got one.  Hey, they don't say my name  weeneth for nothing.  Good one, Chip.  I know.  Oh, sorry.  I've been ready for that one.  Looking at this transcript,  when she goes,  so hot, you're making me wet again?  Yeah.  And then he goes,  jeez, I have to go.  I'll hit you later.  You know what that means, right?  He finished.  He jerked.  Oh, of course. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He finished.  Why would you go at that point  when she's saying she's wet again?  And then he's off to the shower.  And then off to the shower,  this thing is bobbing up and down.  No, it's not.  Not anymore.  Now it's fucking collapsing  like a fucking Civil War soldier  who's just been shot.  It's collapsing and falling in on itself  in a pile of mud.  In our humble opinion,  that's what's going on there.  I'll say it for the record.  He blew a little...  What, is he going to sue me for defamation?  You implied my client came all over himself 
[01:06:30]  while sending photos of his genitals.  Is that true, Mr. Norton?  Yes, prove he didn't cum.  Show me that cock photo  and if there's no cum on it,  I'll eat my hat by gum.  Fuck allegedly.  He was jerking off right here.  He's going to the shallow,  the thing's swinging in the breeze, drooling.  Oh, please.  His dick is...  Looking sick at that point.  It looks like a paralyzed snail  is hanging off his torso.  It's damp.  Nothing worse than your impressive rod 
[01:07:00]  looking sick ten minutes later.  Yeah.  And then it's just silly stringing cum  back and forth to your legs  as you walk to the shower.  Looks like Imogen Lloyd Webber  on the way to the fucking bathroom  just vomiting.  I almost said Webber,  but thank God I saw myself.  She was a vomiting little English girl.  Poor gal.  Oh, yeah.  I felt bad for her.  The woman goes,  so hot, you're making me wet again.  And then he's like,  I have to go.  That's...  Yeah.  Yeah.  He did what he had to do.  Hit me up later.  A Jewish girl  who sucks dick. 
[01:07:30]  I like...  Jimmy's interpretation  was very good.  Sure, you might as well...  I guess why it's not as dirty.  I think you definitely  overshadowed  E-Rock's performance in that.  Yet, E-Rock did a good job.  As a girl, yes, he did.  As the girl, yes.  He's getting so wet.  Yeah, yeah.  I was actually E-Rock saying that.  Looking at these fucking treats.  Looking at Beard Papa's  fucking cream puffs.  He was getting wet.  Hey, pass those around, man.  Sam, you gonna have one? 
[01:08:00]  I will.  You will?  All right.  Let everybody see them.  Pass it around.  Oh!  Ed, you should have one.  No, no, no.  It'll keep you up, man.  That's sugar in that shit.  I gotta stay off the sweets.  Hey, uh...  Yeah.  And by the way,  it was the wind blowing my shirt,  you cunts.  Bought away.  And bought away.  Bought away.  Bought away.  Roland took a picture of me  as I was filming my latest video.  Yeah.  And it might have looked like  I was pregnant.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  One of those where the shirt puffs out? 
[01:08:30]  And all the guys out there  that are so concerned  what I look like.  I know.  Boy, let me tell you.  Look, I accept the jokes.  I really do.  But it's a little creepy  when some of them really meant it.  Guys are very critical of our bodies.  I know.  It's really creepy.  Isn't that fucking creepy?  Fuck you guys.  They're very critical of our bodies.  And again, you are showing it off, Ant.  Oh, yes.  Roland took that picture  as I'm filming some shit yesterday  on the street.  Yeah, go to my Twitter  if you want to see my latest video.  Cheap plug, I know. 
[01:09:00]  And they're saying,  look,  what happened to the V?  The V.  The V.  You should start drinking Bud Blank.  Hey, are you pregnant  with your second kid?  Is this all shit they were saying?  Dude, first of all,  that's a large shirt.  Only an L.  I'm up to an L.  Sometimes I can hit up an M  every once in a while.  And when you video,  you do kind of lean back a little.  I'm trying to remember  the rest of the comments. 
[01:09:30]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  Was he a great big fat person?  He was big through the hips,  a roomie.  A roomie.  Hey, tubby.  Did someone say, hey, tubby?  That's funny.  Hey, get a load of fats over there.  Dude, nobody wants to be called tubby.  Tubby.  And then a few people noticed  that I'm the worst dressed millionaire ever.  Your backwards hat  and your fucking dirty t-shirt.  Well, you have to turn your hat around  if you're fucking in the middle  of filming something.  That is true.  It is a really good video  to be completely honest 
[01:10:00]  because the girl is a whack job.  Yeah, she's cool.  And I'm right in the face of the guy  trying to give a parking ticket out  and I'm like sitting there going,  well, let's see what happens  if the guy has a heart  and we'll let this girl go  because she's pleading her case big time.  Ain't gonna happen.  Huh?  They do not let people go.  Well, this is the audio of the video,  but what the hell?  Nice, lop,  a New York ambient sound.  I'm doing my job, sir.  I'm doing my job, sir.  It's like, all right, whatever. 
[01:10:30]  Can you just pause this?  Can you give me a ticket?  Yeah.  Can you give me a ticket?  We don't have to watch the whole thing  because it's more of a visual.  Yeah, I'm gonna give you a fucking ticket.  Best part, she must be an actress or something  because all of a sudden,  the guy said,  I'm not letting you go at this point.  She goes, oh, thank you very much.  Starts going into her car  and then goes,  what, you're giving me a ticket?  She was trying to bamboozle it.  She was trying some Jedi mind shit on him.  Yeah.  It didn't work.  Go to my Twitter if you want to check out the video.  You're not giving me a ticket.  I'm not giving you a ticket. 
[01:11:00]  Right.  I'm free to leave.  You're free to leave.  It is a good one, though.  Wait, it's backwards.  Well, I was just making silly videos.  Ant's hanging with the movers and the shakers.  I was hobnobbing with the newsmakers.  He hung out with Andrew Breitbart  who started this whole wiener controversy.  Yeah.  And what, late in the night,  you finally talked to him?  No, it was...  It was early?  And we hung out drinking for about three hours.  What am I about to hear here?  Because I don't really know.  This is... 
[01:11:30]  Oh, I pulled out the old iPhone  and took some video  and asked him about...  Wiener?  His...  No, I...  Well, I did ask him about some Wiener stuff.  Was that good enough to play on our show?  Yeah, some good shit on that one.  Breitbart talks about the Wiener press conference.  But I also hit him up about...  If you remember,  he's the guy, Breitbart,  his site was the one that broke  the Homeless Charlie thing  that got us thrown off the air.  Okay.  And suspended for a month.  All right, so why don't we play this one first? 
[01:12:00]  Breitbart talks about the Wiener press conference  and then you got to talk to him about  our problem we had.  Yeah, yeah.  Homeless Charlie,  because he broke that story  and almost got us fired.  He remembered all that.  Got us suspended for 30 days.  Yeah.  And you said,  is it good enough to play on our show?  If it's audio, yes.  Yeah.  Goddamn.  You're my fucking hero.  I don't even know what you said.  I'm talking to you, I scout.  I just don't want to hear Sherrod anymore. 
[01:12:30]  All right, you ready?  All right, we're ready.  Pre-interview.  So, I get a text message today  this afternoon that says  Jason, turn on CNN now.  I turn on CNN  and there Andrew Breitbart is  taking over and hit the Wiener press conference.  What happened?  This is the most bizarre story.  I just got off a plane  from North Carolina.  A car drive brought me out 
[01:13:00]  to my hotel.  It's supposed to meet  a local reporter  of Marcia Kramer.  That's the one  that got kicked out  of his  Carson Wiener's office  and she wasn't there.  And I'm like,  why isn't she here?  She begs me for an interview  and she's not here.  So, I checked my Blackberry  and it says that she's gone  five blocks up the road.  I'm at 47th and Broadway  and she's at 53rd and 75  and five blocks away.  Four blocks up  or one block east  and she said that she's there 
[01:13:30]  for Congress  and Wiener's press conference.  So, I'm thinking to myself,  wow, I can't believe  I'm in about a three-minute,  five-minute walk  to Congress  and Wiener's press conference  and it's a half hour from now.  So, I just went upstairs,  put some water on my face  because I've been traveling  all day  and I said,  okay, I'm going to go  to the conference  and there was no agenda  in mind  and I just walked  into the room  and realized  my number one concern 
[01:14:00]  was that my Blackberry  had run out of power  so I kept looking  for a place  to charge my phone  in a room  when people were trying  to plug in  their equipment everywhere  so there was no place  to find it.  Somehow,  a bunch of people  noticed who I was  and then you could see  in the New York Times  that they were all surrounded.  Looks like Spalding Gray.  This is a group.  This is a beyond group.  You can see that I'm like  up against the wall  like this  and there were about  50 people,  60 people around me  asking me questions 
[01:14:30]  and people say,  get up on the podium.  Get up on the podium.  I'm like,  can I do that?  It's his podium.  Yeah,  get up on the podium  and talk.  We can't hear you.  I go,  okay,  I guess  and I went up there  and I talked  for about 15 minutes  and I thought,  well,  obviously,  it didn't dawn on me  that this was live television.  It did not dawn on me  that this was live television.  I thought that maybe  some people would afford 
[01:15:00]  and some people  would take notes  but I had no idea  why would they cut  the live coverage  on network  and cable news.  It didn't make sense to me.  They were simply waiting  for some people to say  the wieners  at the podium.  They didn't know  how big the story was  at the time.  That communication,  I had no idea  would go  as broad as it did.  So when I got off  the podium,  he was like,  I need to talk to you.  I need to talk to you live.  And so the conversation 
[01:15:30]  was about  my live press conference.  I had no idea.  You weren't  just answering questions.  I'm watching you  just break the media  for not doing their job.  Well, that's what  I do for a living.  Just for everything.  That's what I do for a living.  So the media  can't spin this one anymore?  No, no.  But I mean,  it was 10 excruciating days  of me being blamed  for savaging  the girl that I chose  not to name her name.  It was 10 excruciating days 
[01:16:00]  of being called a hacker.  And I kept wondering,  is there anyone there?  Is there anyone  in the realm  of journalism  to say Salon Magazine  is not allowed  to make stuff up  that's just  born of crap?  Well, is this  a textbook case  of why  Andrew Breitbart  exists?  Yes, and that's  the problem.  It keeps forcing me  to wake up  to do the same thing.  I want to get on  with my life.  I want to have  a life.  But every day  I wake up 
[01:16:30]  and I see  the serendip  of an unfair media  that constantly,  instinctively  goes down  through the messenger.  It constantly,  instinctively  goes after the  old guy.  It constantly  stands up  for the blatant  bad guy.  I don't know  how it got this way.  I mean, I do.  I wrote a friggin'  book on it.  But I can't believe  that we live  in this science fiction  novel.  Isaac Asimov  could not  envision this.  George Orwell  could not  have envisioned this.  These people  have no moral compass. 
[01:17:00]  They have no  ethical compass.  And they attack  the people  who tell the truth  and they support  the people  who are the bad guys.  And it's fun  to have comeuppance  and vindication  in such a public  venue like that.  by mistake.  That was by mistake.  The book is  Righteous Indignation.  You gotta pick it up.  I appreciate what  you do, brother.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Like he was saying, too,  just to get that  out there. 
[01:17:30]  And it just happened  so organically  that he's vindicated  after being smeared  like that  for a couple of days.  He just happened to be  that close to the  press conference?  Yeah, it's just  a complete accident.  But the media  killed this guy  for Acorn.  It's like they're  always killing him  for breaking stories,  but it's like  they break stories  all the time  and they didn't kill  other members  of the press  for breaking Watergate,  which is obviously  more important than this.  But on the scale of things,  Watergate was not  that important.  I mean, you know,  that break-in was  not that important.  Was that when Nixon  was showing his cock? 
[01:18:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Look at this,  you Jew.  Hey, Jew knows.  You know what I mean?  It's the nerve of them  to fucking beat up  Breitbart for breaking  or for setting up Acorn.  Hey, Acorn shouldn't  have done what they did.  Yeah.  They were a bunch of crooks.  Holy shit.  Man, is this going  to help him, huh?  Yeah.  Breitbart was already  on his way,  but this is going to  really fucking  push him forward.  Nice to have somebody  pushing back  against the fucking media.  He broke our  homeless Charlie story.  Yes, he did. 
[01:18:30]  Turns out the Breitbart  people are fans of our show.  Yeah.  And we had a homeless guy  when we used to walk  from one studio  to the other.  Actually, it was the  first day we met him.  And unfortunately,  it was the last day  we ever saw the guy.  I truly believe  that someone had him killed.  We should play that  fucking alive.  I really do believe  because we've never  seen the guy again.  He was a huge fan  of the show.  Homeless guy.  Hilarious.  Had great comedic timing.  So we're like,  come on upstairs.  What the hell?  This is the type of shit  we do, right? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  We used to walk around  New York with a radio  and he came up  and said some shit  and we thought,  ah, this is so  over the top crazy.  You know, this is fine.  But someone grabbed  the audio  and pushed it  to Breitbart  and they posted  it on their website  and fast forward,  we probably were  going to get fired  if we didn't have  Eric Logan around  but the best he could  do for us,  he had to suspend us  for 30 days.  And nothing happened  by the way.  The story went away  like it always does.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fucking Hugh Panera  wanted to fire us.  Yeah, but he was 
[01:19:30]  saying some crazy things  about the Queen of England,  the First Lady.  Yeah, he said he wanted  to, what about  that bitch?  Condoleezza Rice.  Talking about raping  the Queen and Condoleezza.  He was a crazy  homeless guy.  So we felt like  at the time,  because we're aware,  we felt like,  we don't have to  explain this guy.  He's a crazy homeless guy  saying some crazy shit.  Yeah, satellite radio  is perfect for that.  But we learned  the hard way.  Nope.  Don't laugh.  We couldn't laugh.  That was the problem  is that we laughed  along and egged it on.  Yeah. 
[01:20:00]  I think Hugh Panera  who ran XM at the time  certainly wanted us fired  but Logan I think  had enough power  to kind of push back  for us.  Yeah, thank God.  I'll never forget that.  Because even when he  called us and said  what was going on,  I immediately went  into attack mode  like this is bullshit.  Yeah.  And for once,  Logan goes,  listen to me.  Trust me on this.  This isn't bullshit.  You have no idea  what I just fucking  did for you guys.  Take the hit.  He basically said  take the hit.  Yeah.  Get in front of the story  he said.  Yep.  Yeah.  But you know, 
[01:20:30]  that was one time  he pushed back  and didn't let me  rant and rave.  He goes,  listen,  you have no fucking idea  what this was supposed to be.  Don't.  Until about an hour ago.  And that was,  by the way,  I'm glad that happened  in hindsight.  That's right when I taped HBO  and I couldn't even acknowledge XM  because the fans were booing XM  for fucking booting us off.  Right.  Fans were so fucking angry  about that removal.  Yeah.  But that's when I started  to come back  in five days a week again  because then K-Rock  couldn't say anything.  All right.  Fucking cocksuckers.  Oh, swimwalk.  So we had talked to Breitbart 
[01:21:00]  about the Homeless Charlie incident.  Yeah.  It started with Breitbart.  Get a little...  Andrew,  you pretty much busted open  the Homeless Charlie thing  which suspended us  for two weeks.  I think it was even a month.  But it was paid.  Yeah.  So I never got to thank you.  Thank you, by the way.  Thank you.  Because I got paid for it.  I got paid for it.  But what happened there  that the Homeless guy,  he had threatened to rape,  I guess it was Condoleezza Rice,  the Queen, 
[01:21:30]  Maggie Thatcher,  and Barbara Bush.  Oh, not Barbara Bush.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, George Scobie.  The entire reason  to create Breitbart.tv  was to find the most compelling  or controversial clips  on the internet.  And we launched that month.  And the person  who was the editor at the time  was the listener of your show  and he heard it  and he put it up  and the next thing I know  I'm watching you guys  like, you know,  it's fun.  I mean, I can't complain 
[01:22:00]  because at the end of the day  when you hire people  to do a job  and so I'm like,  it's strange.  I was in Europe once  and I read an article  on Google about me  and how I took down  an Arkansas,  a North Carolina congressman,  Bob Attridge,  to like grab the kids  and like  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, Andrew Breitbart's  done it again.  I go,  I'm in Europe on vacation.  And so,  it's funny,  I get,  sometimes I get attacked 
[01:22:30]  for things  that I didn't do personally.  Right.  And sometimes I get phrased  for things  that I didn't do personally.  But it's under your name  is why people go like,  oh, it's Andrew Breitbart.  Right, right.  It's just strange.  You just have to kind of go,  hey, this is what I do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So he was saying  that he wasn't even  kind of responsible for it.  It was his staff  or other people  or something.  But it's under his name  so he knew.  But he didn't put,  Breitbart didn't put 
[01:23:00]  the drudge headline.  Right.  And this is what's amazing  how fast things are declared.  Dude,  will,  like some blogger declared,  will this hurt the merger?  And like,  and that actually made  these dummies go,  well, will it?  Will it?  Right, right.  He just,  his site just put the audio up  thinking it was,  like he said,  his staff were fans,  thought it was interesting audio.  Yeah.  But then when you take that audio  and put a headline above it  that says,  you know,  oh, this is outrageous,  then it becomes a problem.  I don't know if the staff were fans 
[01:23:30]  or if he just kind of feels bad  now in hindsight.  Nah, never.  Because that was put up to try,  which, you know,  again, I could care less.  Yeah.  It got me a month  from fucking going home  at 9 a.m.  and watching Lost.  Yeah, it got me a month paid.  It was great.  Fuck, I could wake up,  a little later.  Was that it?  No, we left earlier.  Actually, we left earlier.  We left at 9.  I was going home at 9 every day.  God, was that fucking fantastic.  Knowing we were coming back on  and I would go home  and watch Lost  in my fucking bedroom.  I would bring my tray tables in  and Stan had loaned me Lost.  Oh. 
[01:24:00]  How many times am I going to say  the word Lost?  Lost.  It was a perfect schedule.  Three hours.  Oh, my God.  It's fantastic.  And getting paid for the whole thing.  Fuck them.  Anyway, here's part two.  Breitbart is a big free speech guy.  Anthony's exclusive interview  with the guy  that broke the wiener story  as they were drinking together  late last night  somewhere in Times Square.  iPhone video, very good.  Yeah, yeah.  Very impressive.  Absolutely.  It's right up there  with the HD flip now.  It's really good.  Yeah, really good.  You can't pan too fast  is the problem.  No, as long as you hold it steady  and you kind of, 
[01:24:30]  like for a still interview like that  with one person,  it's great, yeah.  Audio could be slightly better,  but it's comparable  to the HD flip.  It was a noisy street,  you know,  right by an open bar.  Oh, you could hear everything.  Yeah, so it wasn't bad.  And so it's funny  to have finally met you  because I am a first amendment guy  and I've offended every,  like I went to every right winger  when Bill Morrow  was being attacked after 9-11.  I want comedy to be extreme.  Yeah.  I want, 
[01:25:00]  I grew up in the comedy clubs.  I got my first girlfriend  to break up with me,  broke up with me  because I was taking her  to the comedy clubs.  I go,  but don't you understand  I'm taking her,  you're seeing Seinfeld  at the height of his career.  I go,  you're seeing Richard Lewis,  you're seeing Jenna,  you're seeing all these fuckers.  Jenny.  Jenny.  I got broken up  because of that attitude.  And so like comedy to me  is the exhaust system of culture.  And so I think  that you should be able  to say whatever the hell you want. 
[01:25:30]  And so I remember at the time  Jim Treacher,  who I'm now friends with,  from the Daily Caller.  And he was upset with me  that we drew attention to it.  He goes,  do you understand?  I go,  I'm not advocating  that they're being taken off of the air.  It was an interesting segment.  It was just an interesting story.  That's right.  Right, right.  You aren't saying  take these motherfuckers off the air  because some guy,  a homeless guy,  by the way,  I think satellite radio  is the complete fucking outlet 
[01:26:00]  for a homeless guy,  lunatic,  that wants to voice  his lunacy.  Right.  That is like,  so why,  yeah,  why be held accountable for that?  All I can tell you  is I'm glad  that I could have gotten you paid  a paid vacation.  You guys are just,  we're just drinking.  You're just drunk.  That was great.  What's with the music  in the background?  It was coming out of the bar, right?  It was coming out of the bar.  Yeah.  That was,  that was out on the street,  but there was a big,  like double French doors 
[01:26:30]  and shit that opened  to the streets.  Did other people know  that Breitbart was in the bar?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, people coming around  and taking pictures and shit.  Yeah.  Especially when Ann Coulter came up,  then it was like  a whole big clusterfuck  out on the sidewalk.  It's funny,  she's,  people always,  as many people as hate Ann,  every time I've ever been with her  and people have been,  approached her,  she's been so nice.  Oh, yeah.  And I've never seen anybody  be rude to her.  They're always nice to her  and they're surprised  by how nice she is.  People are like,  fuck Ann Coulter,  and then they walk up  and she's like,  hi!  And they're like,  oh, can we take a picture?  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:27:00]  And she's nice to everybody.  All right, listen,  Florentine's here,  so why don't we take a break?  All right.  Reset a little bit.  As we go to break,  why don't we do  this Duke Nukem thing, too?  Who's,  oh, it's at the game?  Ooh, game, yes.  Duke Nukem Forever  for Xbox 360  or PlayStation 3.  We got one copy  of the new  Duke Nukem Forever video game.  Do you guys like the smell  of a girl's armpits?  No.  Sometimes.  A little.  Maybe a little bit.  Yeah.  You don't like a little bit of,  like, you want a girl  to wear deodorant?  Yeah.  If you're not mine 
[01:27:30]  when they wear deodorant,  that's what if they get  a little fucking.  You got to be attracted to her  and then it's not,  it's okay.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah.  If you're not attracted  to the girl,  oh my God,  it's horrendous.  Oh yeah,  if there's no sexual  or physical chemistry.  If there's no chemical  connection.  It's true, though.  Yeah.  This is the first Duke Nukem  game in 15 years,  by the way.  Wow.  In stores June 14th,  rated M for mature.  And you got to be  a subscriber  and you got to not be  a resident of Alaska,  Hawaii or Canada.  So we'll give one  of those away.  Wow.  Phones are lit.  All right.  Random caller,  I guess,  will work. 
[01:28:00]  And Jim Florentine's  next.  Nice.  Sirius XM,  the virus.  Thanks for calling  the Opie and Anthony  FU line.  Here's the latest batch  of FUs.  Fuck you.  This is for Bobo.  Hey Bobo,  fuck you.  Just get off  the fucking air,  pack your fucking bag,  and go live somewhere  where nobody has to hear  that stupid fucking  voice of yours.  Die, Bobo.  Fuck you.  I just want to give  a big FU to the university  I'm graduating from. 
[01:28:30]  I'm fucking out of here,  biggie.  Fucking for four years,  y'all screw me over.  So fuck you.  Fuck you.  I want to give  a big fuck you  to the Grim Reaper  and Father Time.  See, after taking  my best friends,  my parents,  and leaving  my last 20 years  of medicated  fucking misery.  And you know what?  Don't get cocky,  mother nature,  because I'm not above  kicking you  right in the squad either.  Fuck you.  Fuck you. 
[01:29:00]  This is a dedication  to Anthony.  Anthony,  for you.  I'd like to give  a big FU  to my soon-to-be  ex-wife.  Twelve years  of torture  you put me through.  All I gotta say  is one thing.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  This is my FU  from my good boy phone.  Fuck you.  And this is my FU  from my nutty boy phone.  Fuck you.  Fuck you  to my stupid girlfriend.  Fellow, you're cheating 
[01:29:30]  and it's with a married man.  Guess what?  I hope he gets herpes  from you  and takes it back  to his life.  Fuck you both.  Fuck you.  Huh?  For all you people  out there  telling dirty stories  on me,  FU.  I was just trying  to see if his underpants  fit correctly.  Fuck you.  Call the Opie and Anthony  FU line.  866-FU  line 1.  That's 866-FU  line 1.  Serious,  Serious,  XM,  the virus. 
[01:30:00]  The Opie and Anthony  show.  And we welcome  Jim Florentine  to the show.  It's been a while.  How are you, Jim?  All right, man.  I feel bad  because last time  Florentine was in town,  he gave me a call  to do a little  what they like to call  a play date.  Oh!  Because I got a son.  He's got a son.  Your son.  How old's your son now?  He's like  almost 10 months. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, he's just  a little bit  behind mine.  And they were  going to get together  and do a little  something-something.  That's adorable.  And then we sit around  like assholes  talking about our kids.  And then we say,  all right,  we'll see you next time  and then you go  your separate ways.  Four years ago,  me and Opie were like,  you want to do a play date?  Yeah, all right,  we'll go to a strip club.  Yeah, yeah,  that was a play date.  Now we're watching  kids crawl around  in diapers.  Oh my God.  What happened?  And then I had to tell Jim,  my kid's sleeping  so I don't want to  disturb his nap  so I don't know  if this play date's  going to happen.  Can't you just  wake them up?  I guess you can. 
[01:31:00]  They're not going to know  you woke them up.  They're just going  to be miserable anyway.  I think I wanted to nap  was the real problem.  I think I was tired  that day.  Oh really?  But we'll do it.  But then I brought him  over Jim's  and he was crawling  all over Jim's floor  and I'm like,  I hope he's not in loads.  He was sticking  to the floor  like that kid  in Little Rascals  and they put him  in the corner.  Yeah,  they had to put him  in the glue.  Yeah,  in the glue.  Is Jim a good uncle?  Yeah,  he was great though.  The kid loved him.  Yeah,  Jim's good with my kid too.  Babies love me.  They just, 
[01:31:30]  infants take to me.  You just got to smile.  And animals like me too.  Animals like you.  They really do.  I'm very popular  with animals and infants.  Anything innocent  knows that I'm  instinctively protective.  Okay.  They like you, huh?  Well,  baby's like a guy  with a creepy smile.  He almost looks  like a pedophile  but baby's not.  He just could be fun.  I'm starting to hang out  with assholes  because I have a kid.  Oh, shit.  What do you mean?  I'm a pretty private person. 
[01:32:00]  Don't have a lot of friends.  The ones I have,  I really, you know,  respect or whatever.  But now,  because you have a child,  you're talking to people  you would never  fucking talk to.  Have you gotten  in that world yet?  A little bit.  Not too much.  And you're like,  fuck, you're an asshole.  I hope my kid  doesn't really like your kid  when he gets older.  Because I don't want  to hang out with you.  Yeah, it's almost like...  Give it a few more months.  Yeah, I'm sure.  When you start hanging out  at playgrounds,  and beaches  and parks. 
[01:32:30]  Yes.  People come up to you  and they're like,  just because they have a kid,  you have a kid.  It's like something in common.  Next thing you know,  you're talking to some asshole.  It's almost like  when you wear  a Metallica shirt  or a Savage shirt.  It's like,  you're in a Savage shirt  and then you go  have coffee with the guy  for an hour.  Yes.  That's what it is.  I'm not looking forward to it  because I know about metal.  I don't know about babies.  Yeah.  Yeah, he crawls.  Yeah, he shits.  Yeah, he pisses.  My sister and brother  are a bunch of years  ahead of me  as far as kids,  so I ask them  all the questions.  I'm like,  do you really have to  hang out with idiots 
[01:33:00]  because your kids get along?  He's like,  you have no fucking idea.  Jesus.  I like the fact  that Jim's implying  he goes for coffee  with people  because they like Sabbath.  Half the fucking losers  that are our fans,  I love Sabbath.  Good, me too.  And I walk away.  And just walk away?  I don't care who they are.  But for some reason  you feel like you can't walk away  when the kids are playing together.  I'll do it after  a comedy show  because I'll talk to somebody  about metal for an hour.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I'll do that.  Really?  But then again,  then you get,  you know,  how come this guy  hasn't been on the show  and how did you pick this band?  Some guy punched me  at a Slayer show  because I picked Metallica 
[01:33:30]  over Slayer on our TV show.  Oh, well,  at least it was reasonable.  He punched me in the head.  Yeah, I was signing shit  and it just came by  and so I got clocked in the head.  He's like,  that's what you get  for picking fucking  Metallica over Slayer, dude.  I'm like,  all right,  you got a point.  For what?  In the head?  Gaze band?  I think it was  the best of the big four bands  metal bands.  No, the big four  they called Slayer,  Megadeth,  Anthrax,  and Metallica  and they're playing  at Yankee Stadium.  Oh, it's a tour.  Yeah, sorry.  They play ball?  They're like the big four 
[01:34:00]  of thrash  is what they're called.  Boo.  I know what you said.  Good.  Can you say it again?  Yeah, you did.  You heard it?  Yeah, maybe John Sterling  can announce the concert.  James Hetfield!  He stinks.  A hat full of goodness.  Is it here?  The first couple years  he did it,  that's fine,  all right,  it's corny,  but okay,  but enough.  Same with Chris Berman  with his stupid  fucking names.  What names does he give?  He gives nicknames  to people. 
[01:34:30]  I didn't mind Berman.  Yeah, you didn't mind  it 20 years ago.  He's still doing it, though.  He's still doing it.  I always minded  Sterling's home run calls  because like we've said  on this show,  they're forced.  Totally.  If it's a natural thing,  you can get away with it,  but he forces it  every fucking time.  Maybe the first time  he did it  with the first team  members he did it with  or something  or just a couple,  but now,  whenever, you know,  they get a new player  on the team,  he's got to figure out  what he's going to say  about them  when they hit  a fucking home run.  Well, he's got  that Granderson guy.  Granderson is the worst. 
[01:35:00]  The Grandy Man,  oh, Ken.  Oh, the Grandy Man,  Ken.  The Grandy Man,  Ken.  Shut up.  You don't like that, Jim?  God, is that,  oh, the fucking  drives me nuts.  And then that's the clip  they play on SportsCenter.  Well, I think it's  to mock him, too.  I think they want  everybody to know  what an annoying  fucking shit he is.  We got one.  We got to play it now.  A home run call?  Hit it.  There'll be an 0-1  to Granderson.  And Papelbaum,  deal, swung on.  There it goes.  Did he write?  It is high.  It is far. 
[01:35:30]  It is gone.  That's okay right there.  Oh, Curtis,  you're something  sort of Granderson.  Shut up.  He drills a long  home run to break  the tie in the  right field seats.  The Grandy Man can.  The Grandy Man can.  Curtis Granderson,  homer to right,  his second as a Yank,  and gives the Yankees  a 10th inning  to one league.  Fucking stinks.  And he doesn't have  people around him  who could,  it's like,  you know,  Paris Hilton doesn't  have people around her 
[01:36:00]  to go,  you're a bore.  He doesn't have  people around him  that will go to him.  That stinks  when you do that.  It's horrible.  Why can't the Yankees  do that?  I don't know.  The Yankee final office  do that.  The Steinbrenners.  They must like it.  They have to like it.  They're dummies.  Yeah, they would have  shut him down.  I forgot we talked  to Paris Hilton already.  Yeah.  I really did.  We had Paris in here.  Yeah, I heard it  didn't go well.  We didn't attack her  because it was so  interesting how horrible  she was.  It was too easy  to just beat the shit  out of her.  It was horrible. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  She was a bad interviewer.  Stunk.  Yeah.  She stunk.  But that's who she is.  Did she get offended  by anything you guys  said in the interview?  Well, we were,  who,  Ann was bringing up  Lindsay Lohan.  Yeah, I just wanted  her take on,  you know,  the whole Hollywood thing  and she's been through it  and she's like,  I don't want to talk  about Lindsay.  I want to talk  about my show.  I'm here to talk  about my show.  I'm here to talk  about the show.  Just shut the fuck up,  you bitch.  She was a bore.  She revealed nothing.  She was just terrible.  She was a terrible  interviewer, dude.  Terrible fucking  She's doing a reality show  so you babble a little bit. 
[01:37:00]  That is painful,  by the way.  I watched some of it  because I didn't,  I watched maybe  two seconds of it  before she came in  because I could give a shit  and I finally watched  a little bit more of it.  That voiceover she does  It's horrible, right?  It's fucking painful  to watch.  Because the producers  realized they had nothing  and they had to pump it up.  So they wrote lines for her  and then she does voiceovers  over her material.  Yeah, they must have  looked at it and said,  wow, there's nothing here.  Can you come in  and loop some shit?  And it was horrible.  And that was written for her, 
[01:37:30]  you could tell.  Of course.  You think?  I thought they were organic to me.  Some low-level comic writing.  It felt very what?  Organic.  Very genuine.  Like shit.  Her dialogue just seemed  very off the cuff  and that's the way she lives.  Yeah, that's the person she is.  She's wild.  If she had good management  or PR,  just say,  look,  this is a guy's audience,  this show.  Just play along with them.  Play along.  And they'll get some good plugs  and some of these guys  that would never watch your show  are going to go,  you know what?  I'll check it out.  Yeah.  I remember when Richard Simmons  went on Stern for the first time.  I'm like,  why are you having this fag on?  And I was interested in the guy 
[01:38:00]  because he was a great guest.  Yeah.  And I'm like,  I like when he comes on  and when he would have let him  and I go,  I'm going to watch him.  Turns out she was partying  the night before she came in here  even though she doesn't do that anymore,  she told us.  She's a businesswoman  and she gets up early.  At one point we go,  you seem kind of annoyed or something.  She goes,  no,  it's just early  and the clock I think said 9.40 at the time.  I run 17 companies.  Turns out she was partying  until like 3 in the morning.  Yeah.  I would have respected her  if she said,  look,  I was partying until 3 in the morning. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  I'm kind of cunty.  You know how much I would have loved her  if she said,  look.  Yeah, that would have been like,  okay, fine.  Guys,  I apologize.  Believe me.  I'm cunty  because I'm up late.  I would love her  if she had the balls to say that.  Her whole angle is  she's reinventing herself  and she's not that person anymore  but she's still that person  but she's making believe she's not.  She gave a great blowjob though.  God damn,  I like her sex tape.  Love it.  Did you like the blowjob  she was giving?  Love that fucking...  For that gentleman?  Yeah,  that Rick Solomon  really knew how to fucking get a Hummer.  Rick Solomon.  Yeah,  he sure was getting his knob hobbed. 
[01:39:00]  I just want to get caught up  in a scandal  when I've texted my photo  to somebody with my penis.  Oh,  there it is.  Nobody cares though.  It really bothers me.  She certainly can.  Yours is out there,  I'm sure.  Oh,  dude.  It's just got to be...  How many do you think have it?  How many dick pics?  How many Jim Norton dick pics?  At least 50?  Of course.  He wants to go,  what are you,  a rookie?  How many girls do you think  have your dialogue,  you know, 
[01:39:30]  back and forth,  your texting or whatever,  your emails?  Over a hundred.  Over a hundred.  Over the years?  Yeah.  Yeah.  If they've saved it.  Yeah.  Let them.  And then how many dick pictures  would you say?  How long have I been able  to do that with my phone?  For however long I've been able,  I would say probably  over the last seven years.  He's mailing them out  like Joan Crawford  with her fucking pictures.  Yeah,  I sign them.  His email is.  Yeah.  Oh,  that's a great one.  That was summer of 97  up in Cape Cod.  You can see it's cold,  by the way.  My balls are grabbing my body. 
[01:40:00]  But you know,  it was funny,  I was joking yesterday,  but it's like with comedians,  no one gives a fuck  because politicians,  it's like they scold people  for doing this shit.  Yeah.  And that's why when you get them,  it feels so good.  Nobody cares about a guy  who talks about his dick  for a living.  Nobody gives a shit.  Yeah.  Yeah,  that was my whole point yesterday  was like some jobs,  it's like you could just do  whatever the fuck you want  on the internet  and no one cares.  Yeah.  Radio is like,  that's it.  Race,  race shit will get you fucked  if you don't word it properly.  Yeah.  But other than that, 
[01:40:30]  first,  you could send your cock,  your fucking,  I'd like to fuck in the ass,  whatever.  Because people like to get you.  People like to feel like,  aha,  got ya.  And it's like when someone  is telling on themselves,  you don't have that satisfaction  of getting them.  Yeah.  Because they don't care.  When they're holier than thou,  and then they get caught,  you just like,  oh,  you didn't fucking do that  after you preached  all that bullshit.  It's like that guy,  Ted Haggerty,  the fucking,  you know,  from that church  who was preaching  against gays  and he was like, 
[01:41:00]  like,  awkwardly fighting them,  getting,  and then he was going  to this fucking gay masseur.  Yeah.  And the guy out of them.  I think Bill Tetley  broke that story.  Who?  Bill Tetley.  Bill Tetley certainly did break,  by the way,  the Bill Tetley Variety Hour  will be starting soon.  No,  no,  no.  Disgusted with Bill Tetley.  Anthony Cumia is booked  as the second guest  on the Bill Tetley Variety Hour.  Jimmy fucking texts me  one night last week  and he goes,  so when are you, 
[01:41:30]  when are you booked  to be on?  And I'm like,  oh,  the 27th,  Hannity.  And he goes,  no,  no,  the Bill Tetley Variety.  Like,  you fucking,  what are you doing?  He's not even the lead guest.  No,  and I'm not the lead guest.  Who's the lead guest?  I forget the woman's name,  but she was a tomato expert.  Tomato expert.  And the dumb band.  Pumpkin Fuss.  Pumpkin Fuss.  Are we going to see this?  Of course not. 
[01:42:00]  Ventil.  Ventil.  Ventil in Jimmy's retarded head.  No,  Bill Tetley,  it'll be on.  Bill Tetley.  I think Oxygen.  When you said,  no,  Bill Tetley,  I'm like,  fucking nailed me.  I thought you were talking about Hannity.  I know you did.  That's why I said,  did his producers contact you?  Yeah,  yeah,  did his producers contact you?  I'm like,  Hannity?  Yeah,  I'm on the 27th.  Maybe Logan could put that on own for you.  Yes,  they certainly need the help.  They sure do.  I texted Logan yesterday,  wanted no part of me today.  Yeah.  Yeah,  because there's a Lady Gaga thing happening.  Lady Gaga. 
[01:42:30]  Starting at nine o'clock,  you're not going to be able to move around the workplace  because they're shutting this place down for Lady Gaga.  Yeah,  they're going to rat maze the staff.  They rat maze when Oprah people come around.  In here,  and then what,  out the side?  I don't know.  The wooden door into the elevator.  I'm walking where the fuck I want.  You think so.  Why can't they just think so?  You watch.  When she gets to the building,  have four big black guys take her upstairs in the elevator  and walk right to that fishbowl.  Yeah,  just say the morning show from Shade.  Why don't they just walk around?  No,  but seriously,  it's that big of a deal.  Jim,  I was telling somebody before, 
[01:43:00]  we were on MTV probably like 10 years ago  when Pam Anderson was still in her prime.  Remember,  she had like those three black guys walking by,  but that was it.  There wasn't a whole entourage,  and me and Jim made one step to go towards it.  It'd go,  don't go any further.  I'm like,  okay,  and then we just walked away.  You knew not to go any further,  right?  Yeah,  I knew not to go any further.  Was that one of the days we were going up to write?  The VH1 was in that building,  too.  Was that the day we met Ozzy?  I think it was to write.  Okay.  Remember we met Ozzy?  That's where I met Ozzy.  Jim got me the photo in the back office there at MTV. 
[01:43:30]  Was that the first time you ever met him?  First time I ever met him.  Were you freaking out?  I asked him to sign a business card,  which I still have,  but then Jim was like,  I got the picture,  and I didn't get pictures back then.  That was 97.  I was working at Tickles.  I think I started this,  man.  He did.  Oh, shit.  You're responsible for this.  I used to get autographs.  Yeah.  Prior to Candace and I go,  on the index cards.  Ozzy,  I was just getting,  on my business card,  and fucking Jim goes,  get the picture.  Picture?  And I'm like,  all right.  You started this way.  I didn't see it.  Jim got me the fucking photo with Ozzy,  and then I took one of him and Ozzy. 
[01:44:00]  Pictures?  Well,  Mr. Norton,  that's a very interesting idea.  Take some pictures,  you buddy.  Why don't you shut up?  Why don't you shut up?  What was your first celebrity picture?  I know which,  what mine was.  It was probably Ozzy  at 16 years old.  16 years old.  Ozzy,  and then I got Randy Rhodes,  too.  Do you still have the Randy picture,  dude?  You gotta put that up.  You gotta tweet it.  That's an amazing photo.  Mine was Groucho Marx.  You got a picture with Groucho  somewhere?  Yes.  Fucking tweet that.  It's long gone. 
[01:44:30]  Your mom's got to have it.  No,  it's my dad on California.  No,  I'm sorry,  Ivan Koloff.  When I was 14,  I had a bunch of wrestlers.  Yeah, sure.  And Stan Stasiak.  And you were getting molested.  Nice.  Remember the hard punch,  Stan the Man Stasiak?  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Those two.  Mine was living color.  Are they both gone?  Are they both gone?  Koloff's still alive.  Koloff's still around?  I think Stasiak died,  though.  Stan the Man Stasiak?  He used to have the hard punch.  They used to put the guy's arm  all the way back.  Oh, shit.  And then punch him,  but then all of a sudden, 
[01:45:00]  someone said,  hey,  just block his arm  with the other arm.  Someone all of a sudden  figured it out.  It took him two years  to figure it out.  Yeah,  just block it.  That's hilarious, man.  I haven't Koloff.  I guess they didn't study  tape back then.  No, no.  If we look at his technique  every time,  we could really block that.  So,  you never saw  your Groucho picture again?  No,  no.  It was just gone.  He actually got that  on the set of duck soup.  Yes.  It was very impressive.  I was 30. 
[01:45:30]  Anthony's old.  Do you have connections  to California still?  You should ask him  to try to find that.  No,  I don't have connections  anymore in California.  No connections whatsoever  out there, huh?  No,  unfortunately.  It was probably in a box  that got thrown out.  Oh,  forget it.  He didn't make digital copies  back then,  you know?  No,  just paper fucking pictures.  Groucho Marx.  He was in a wheelchair  with like,  and it was one of the  oldie time wheelchairs  with the blanket  over his legs  and he was all frail  and shaky  and I got down there  and took a picture of him  and then he signed something  but it was like 
[01:46:00]  shaky Groucho.  You don't think your mom  might have that in a box  somewhere like that  might have gotten shipped  with your father's possessions?  Nah.  You want to check  your dad's family.  You might be able  to find that.  There might be in a box  somewhere.  Maybe like my stepmother.  She's got pictures  but I haven't seen those.  When was Groucho Marx born?  When was Groucho born?  I want to do this math again.  Yeah, that's like  how old Groucho was  when I saw him.  That was oldie fucking Groucho.  Sam, look up Groucho.  When was he born?  Oh my god.  I'm going to guess 1876.  I took a picture of a guy  that was born in the 1800s, right?  Yeah.  Is that possible?  1890. 
[01:46:30]  1890.  I'm going to take a picture  of a guy that was born in 1890.  I met someone  that was born in 1890.  What the fuck?  How the fuck did that happen?  Groucho honestly  could have known someone  that fought in the Civil War.  He could have like  had contact.  1865.  35 years.  Yeah.  So someone could have been like 55,  had fought in the Civil War,  met Groucho 
[01:47:00]  when he was a kid  or even a teen  and then I met Groucho.  I was separated  by one fucking person  to someone that fought  in the Civil War.  You realize it's 2011 now.  That's crazy.  And you have a picture  of the guy  that was born in 1890.  That doesn't make sense.  That's fucking crazy.  What year?  Because he died in 77.  It was 76.  Yeah, 75 or 76.  I got a picture with him.  If he was alive,  he'd be 121.  Wow.  Right?  How great would it be  if memories came back 
[01:47:30]  that he molested you?  Like you got a picture  and his hand crept down  from under the blanket  and kind of fingered your ass  a little bit  while the camera fumbled?  He fucking licked my ass  with his cigar breath  and his mustache  tickling my little  young rectum.  I've got to ask you  the obvious  as CNN shows it again.  Anthony Weiner.  Yes.  Oh, I'm just looking.  Wait, wait.  No, I can't look.  I was saying  if I had a chest like that  and a bulge,  I'd fucking make it  my head shot.  I don't blame the guy.  I'd be sending that out too.  I'm just glad  all my dick pictures 
[01:48:00]  that are out there  are not mine.  They're my buddy  Chuck McGonnelly  who's a comic  who was packing like 11.  He took a picture  of his mule  and then I said  forward that to me.  Does he have a big penis, Chuck?  Yeah, it's huge.  Wow.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, so he forwarded it to me  so anytime a girl wanted  I'd send his dick out.  Oh, that's a good one.  Even if we go to court,  you can show mine,  I'll bring Chuck in  and then Chuck's got  a huge vein  right in the middle.  I didn't know Chuck  had a big hug.  I thought he was  like a seven guy.  No, it's huge.  What if you had  to hook up with a girl  then after you showed  her that dick pic  and she gets your dick? 
[01:48:30]  It's just, you know,  keep it dark  and then apologize  in the morning.  Just say,  look, it was for  good angle that night.  And they're never  going to mention it.  I just took a Cialis  about an hour before.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They won't mention it.  No, they don't mention it  but that's what we used to do.  We used to go to a bar  and just go up to girls  and go,  I'm looking for my friend.  Did you see him  and show his dick?  No way.  One time Chuck got laid.  Girls, whose dick is that?  He goes, that's mine.  She goes, I'm fucking that tonight.  He goes, okay.  Wow.  Yeah.  Well, that's handy. 
[01:49:00]  Never happened to me.  That's a good one.  He's in Pittsburgh now, right?  Yeah.  Jeez, that's a handy thing to have.  His dick is bent though.  It hurt it.  He injured his dick.  Oh, did he break it?  Yeah.  Was it a girl  pouncing on it  up and down?  He's not sure  how you broke your dick.  Now, that's fishy.  That's like a fucking bullet wound.  He probably got it kicked  in a glory hole.  You don't forget  how your dick breaks.  You forget where you left your keys  and how your fucking cock breaks.  No one's ever said,  how'd you get that dick injury?  Ah, shit.  I'll think about it.  It'll come back to me. 
[01:49:30]  You always know exactly.  It's like when Kennedy was killed.  Yeah.  You know exactly where you were  on 9-11  and when your dick was broken.  Fucking Chuck.  There's a fucking shady story  behind that.  Probably bouncing a toddler  in his lap.  The kid put their knee  on his heart on.  Something creepy.  That's a touchy situation  when a girl is on top  and she's riding you  and you're like,  this is on the brink of bending, man.  I don't want to say anything.  I don't want to stop it  or ruin the moment,  but I don't want to  fucking twist this thing up. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, you got to hold them  at the hips.  Yeah, yeah, you got to hold them  and kind of push them down  a little bit this much,  like an inch and a half.  That's it.  Yeah, exactly.  That's it.  Got to guide them.  Yeah, exactly.  Study show.  They can just roll them over.  If you got a big one,  you can let them go  like six inches up,  but I got about an inch and a half.  Just barely  get off the ground.  Just give enough room.  Not a large gantry.  No, we didn't go to  Worst of Assholes.  We talked about all this shit  already?  Did we?  Ah, whatever.  Who the fuck remembers 
[01:50:30]  it for the first time?  How do you remember?  Blow me.  You think Wiener's done  there, Florentine?  I don't know how he's  going to get out of this.  I mean, I just love  these Jewish guys, man.  They're fucking horny, man,  because they didn't grow up  with that guilt with sex.  Mm-hmm.  You know,  spits the same way,  this guy, you know what I mean?  They don't sit there,  just like, hey, yeah,  you fuck, your parents  don't even care.  12, yeah, go out and fuck.  Yeah, go out and fuck,  and then he's,  but you know,  once you become a politician,  that shit,  you're done with it.  You can't be sending pictures  of your cock  to college girls. 
[01:51:00]  Especially after, like,  the last, you know,  seven congressmen  have got busted  over the last, like,  two or three years.  What do you think?  Okay, they're not going to,  all these chicks  save everything now.  Yep, yep,  and then you're just,  you're sunk.  Any chick that saves  text messages  from, like,  three years ago  is just,  well, they know,  look, you get a reality show.  Look at Kim Kardashian's  a fucking multi-millionaire  for putting a porno tape out.  Yeah.  Banging a guy.  Now, so every girl's like,  oh, I'm going to save these,  and then I can get on,  and all the chicks  Jesse James,  they're all doing reality shows  and all that shit,  and Tiger Woods' chicks. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, yeah.  So every girl's like,  oh, so I'll be a whore  for, like, a day,  and then all of a sudden  I'll have my own show.  It's my in.  Yeah, my in to the fucking  world of show business.  I'm glad I'm out of that, man,  because I would've got  fucking busted  every two seconds.  Yeah, but, again,  we were talking about jobs,  and it doesn't really matter  for you.  Well, if you've got a chick  at home, it does.  Oh, well, that's different.  I'm not worried  about the job thing.  I mean, career-wise,  it's like, you know,  who gives a shit?  Some chick I used to have  sex with years ago,  she goes,  if you ever make it,  I'm going to call  the National Enquirer 
[01:52:00]  and say,  you suck in bed  and you have a small dick.  I go, good.  Go tell him.  I fucking write to him  right now.  I can care less.  You'll never be able  to sue him for slander.  Yeah, it is tricky  when you're a politician  like that, though.  I don't know  what they're thinking, too,  because they see  what happens.  You can see  exactly what happened,  and then you're,  what has that got to feel like  being the guy  at the podium  going like,  holy shit,  now I'm the guy.  Now I'm the guy.  I was just watching the guy. 
[01:52:30]  Now I'm the fucking guy.  It shows,  I'll tell you why politicians,  A, because they're holy rollers,  but B, because  it shows bad judgment.  Like, the fact is,  like, that's a guy  that makes decisions  on my life  that affect my taxes,  my roads,  and he's that dumb  that he would do that.  It shows how stupid  these guys are.  If a guy was single  and did it  and admitted it,  that's one thing,  but then there's the thinking,  well, look,  if he'll lie to his wife,  he'll lie to me.  I mean, that's why  these guys get in  such deep shit.  And that's the,  the lie is worse  than the fucking act.  Yeah, in most cases.  Because being a politician, 
[01:53:00]  they just don't want  people lying.  They don't want  misappropriations  of resources  in their office.  Like, if he was using  his office phone  and making fucking,  having phone sex  with girls,  that's not allowed.  I bet he did.  He had to have.  And I guarantee  that's going to sink him.  They're going to get  him out of technicality.  He used government stuff  for one.  You also learn  that social networking  is for the young.  This Anthony Wiener  couldn't figure out  what this whole thing  was about.  He thought it was one thing  when it was the other thing.  Yeah, I mean,  if he's got some other shit 
[01:53:30]  that's going to come out,  he should have just resigned now.  Because if he doesn't,  then they're really  going to go after him  and he could be charged  or something.  If he just resigns now,  I think they'll just let it go,  let him go in obscurity  for a while.  There might be  another picture out there  that someone in this room  might have seen.  Someone in this room  might have been privy  to the checkmate picture.  I'll just say  all the pictures  have not been released.  That's been confirmed.  And yeah,  I may have seen  a photo.  That's Ann Coulter 
[01:54:00]  looking at a picture  that...  And that's her reaction.  One of the pictures  that haven't been released.  And that's her reaction.  She has her hand  over her mouth,  by the way.  Hand over mouth,  gasping.  Yes.  gasping  as fucking Eugene Levy  is showing her the picture.  It really does look like  Eugene Levy  with his Groucho Marx glasses.  What the fuck?  Yeah,  there's Andrew Breitbart.  Yeah,  Ann was drinking  with Andrew Breitbart  last night.  Ann Coulter.  Fucking hammered.  He's a fun guy, 
[01:54:30]  I gotta tell ya.  He likes to tip  a few hundred back.  Oh, yes.  He's a fun guy  to drink with.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So there might be  some other pictures.  Yeah.  And I would,  if I was a betting man,  and as you know,  I don't really bet  that often.  But when you do,  when I do,  I bet a lot of money.  Yeah, you bet everything.  I bet the house.  How much for the mustache?  If I was a betting man,  I would say  this picture  will,  will get out. 
[01:55:00]  Do you think  it might go to some place  like,  now that the case  has been,  whatever,  made public,  that maybe there's  someone who would  be willing to buy it?  Like Radar Online  or one of these companies?  No, buy it.  Because why release it  for free when you have,  you don't need it  for the story.  I don't know.  I don't know if anybody,  depending on how graphic  this picture is,  I don't know if anybody  wants to be a porn salesman.  You know,  to sell a picture,  to sell a picture  of him in his underwear  or taking a picture  in the mirror  is one thing.  To sell what would amount 
[01:55:30]  to the category  of hardcore pornography  might, you know,  leave a bad taste  in someone's mouth.  Fair enough.  I don't want to be  a porn broker.  So, I,  but I do think  any of these pictures  would get out.  And who's going  to post them?  You think Drudge  posts the pics?  No, I,  I don't post it hard on them.  I think they might end up  on that big,  big government.  Okay, what about,  well, TMZ would certainly.  Yeah.  Yeah, once,  once they get out,  they're going to be everywhere. 
[01:56:00]  Can you tell it's him?  Uh, I didn't see a face,  but there is complete  verification  that it is him.  Would you say  that that's through  phone number records  and all that stuff?  Yes, phones,  texts that went along  with it.  What, did he have  a business card  that said fucking  Anthony Weiner  on his thigh?  This idiot.  There's photos  he tweeted of himself  and he takes pictures  of his body  and there's photos  of him and Clinton  in the background.  Yeah.  Are you dumb?  Yeah, isn't there  a picture of his kids too?  Yeah.  Yeah, and his big nose  hanging down. 
[01:56:30]  Covers his eyes  but not his big schnoz.  Yeah, good work.  And it's not like  everyone's got a picture  of them and Clinton  behind them  while they're jacking off.  I have a picture  with Clinton.  Well, do you have it  behind you  on a little dresser?  Exactly.  While you're showing  that beautiful body off?  Wiener.  Well, according to listeners,  not so beautiful  these days.  Well, he was doing that  probably, he probably  wanted to show off  that picture of Clinton  and he couldn't just do it  so he just had it  in the background.  What was that  in the background?  That's the picture  of me and the boss.  That was a weird one  after a night of laughs. 
[01:57:00]  What's he thinking?  He's just a dope.  These are up there forever.  Can't do that.  What he's thinking is  he doesn't know  what social networking is.  I'm telling you.  He thinks he was  completely safe.  God, look at me.  He's got family pictures.  He has no body fat.  How depressing is that?  No body fat at all.  He's not eating  any of those  fucking cream puffs.  Yeah, that's true.  I ate a cream puff.  You should have had one, Ian.  I had one.  No, no.  It was delicious.  Eating the cream puff.  Have a cream puff.  No, Florentine.  Forget it.  You're never going to get  Florentine to eat a cream puff. 
[01:57:30]  Really?  You don't do desserts?  Once in a while, I do.  I've never seen you  have a dessert.  You have the best willpower.  Fucking Florentine could eat.  When we lived together,  he would make,  every morning,  he would take hard-boiled,  he would hard-boil  six eggs or four eggs  and fucking peel them  and eat the egg whites  every morning.  Now I just have  liquid egg whites.  I just pour them  right in a pan  and fucking cook up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Scramble them up.  Yeah, that and some oatmeal.  That yolk, though,  is really the flavor maker,  isn't it?  Yeah.  I'm not a big yolk guy now.  I'm not a yolk guy.  The yolk's on me. 
[01:58:00]  What?  How could you not be  a yolk guy?  Although now that I,  when I make scrambled eggs,  I'll put one yolk in.  Yeah?  Just to get a little,  get a little yellow  and up a little bit.  I guess you might be right.  That yolk is the magic  elixir of the egg.  Oatmeal sucks.  Do you not like to fucking dip?  Let's be honest.  Who doesn't like  sunny side up eggs?  Oh, toast.  And fucking dip  your toast in there.  English muffins.  And you get it all over your lip  and you go,  hey, look, somebody came in my mouth  and everybody in the diner's like,  boo.  You go for a low joke  and it gets a zero. 
[01:58:30]  Hey, where you at  with the metal show there, Florentine?  We're doing season eight  end of July.  We're taping out.  I think it starts August 20th.  Season eight?  Yeah.  Fucking gun smoke.  That's awesome.  Because it ran a long time.  Get it?  We'll catch up to the Simpsons.  Are you running out of things  to talk about?  No.  We repeated some guests,  but, you know.  Yeah, there's always something going on.  Absolutely.  This is great.  We're trying to get Van Halen  someone for Van Halen this season  because they're out.  They're going to start touring.  They're doing some dates  over in Australia in September. 
[01:59:00]  Supposedly, the album's done, too.  The new album.  And I hear it's great.  With DLR?  Yeah.  You always hear the album's great  before anyone gets to hear it.  Or Wolfgang on bass.  Yeah, of course.  Can't have that.  With David Lee Roth.  Yeah, Roth.  Why is Michael Anthony not playing?  He's a Higgard guy.  The Van Halen brothers are babies.  They really are, right?  They got mad because  when Van Halen took like 11 years off,  Michael Anthony went out  to play with Sammy Hagar's solo band  and they got pissed.  Yeah, they got all mad.  They are fussy.  He's like, look,  I just want to go out and play.  I don't know. 
[01:59:30]  What the fuck do you want me to do?  They haven't put an album out  since Van Halen 3 in 1994.  The Gary Cherone disaster?  That's the last...  Wow.  Was that...  It says that metal show,  David Coverdale?  Yeah.  Is that David Coverdale?  Yeah.  He doesn't look like David Coverdale.  We interviewed him in Vegas  and I saw him recently.  That's exactly what he looked like.  He looks pretty much the same.  Yeah, he looks good.  Yeah, he has all his oils and stuff.  He looks good,  but he doesn't look like he did like...  He looks like Napoleon Dynamite  without the glasses.  Like something weird happened  to his teeth or something. 
[02:00:00]  I didn't hear what you said.  Yeah, it's all right.  What did you say?  Yeah, nothing.  I heard glasses.  Napoleon Dynamite.  I heard you.  I just played along  just for the record.  No, you didn't.  Yeah, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  Look, I'm not even looking at you.  Of course I did.  Wow, so Van Halen.  But hearing the record sounds great.  Here it sounds like  a Fair Warning album.  Oh, that's all right.  You liked Van Halen, right?  Yeah, the old stuff.  Yeah, I mean the Sammy stuff  was good too.  You didn't like the old stuff?  I hate, hate.  Again, there's a couple songs I like.  Like Run With the Devil's a good tune 
[02:00:30]  but I just, I cannot  enjoy any of their stuff.  I like Just a Gigolo's  a David Lee Rothen kind of dig.  There's a few songs I like  but like Run It, like  Dance the Night Away.  Well, that's the poppy stuff.  Yeah, they got Beautiful Girls.  What about Unchained and all that shit?  Get Van Halen too.  It's got Dance the Night Away on there  but it's a really good record.  Start with Van Halen too and then  I play them on the Boneyard.  I'll play them, people request them  and I just hate them.  There was a, like David Lee Roth 
[02:01:00]  after Sammy Hagar hooked up with Van Halen  David Lee Roth was doing some solo shit  and singing some of the Van Halen songs  and it seemed like he was kind of  almost trying to prove that he could sing like Sammy  on some of the songs  so he went way above his range  and it sounded like shit.  I heard him live once  and he was trying to like  I think he was doing Jump  and he was trying to like  really push it up an octave  and it wasn't working.  It sounded like shit.  I hope he stopped doing that. 
[02:01:30]  Well, I saw him about three years ago  when they did the reunion tour  and he never sang better.  He must have went and got voice lessons  or something.  Same with Ozzy.  Ozzy sounds better than  I've heard him in 30 years.  He fucking sounds great live, man.  Yeah, so they do something  where they got voice lessons  and just learn really how to sing.  So he was great.  But yeah, Roth had that great band  in the beginning  with Steve Vai and Billy Sheehan.  He had the Eat Em and Smile album  with Yankee Rose and all that  and then he had one more  and then he pretty much tailed off after that.  Yeah, he had some legitimate hits  on those solo albums 
[02:02:00]  after he left Van Halen.  Yeah, they were great albums  and then he would hang out  at the Comedy Cellar every night  by himself  with Jack Daniels  and sit at a table by himself  and just  I never saw someone laugh  so hard at every fucking joke, right?  When Roth was hanging out at the cellar?  He was never in the room  when I went on.  I remember he would be upstairs  hanging out  because his uncle,  Manny Roth,  started,  Manny Roth,  not Manny Dorman.  Manny Dorman was the guy you knew.  Manny Roth started,  I want to say Cafe Wa  and the Cellar years ago.  So David Lee Roth  was tied into those places. 
[02:02:30]  Called Manny Roth.  Yeah.  I didn't ask why.  And if I see a blonde thing  on the bed,  I'll know I have a weave.  And he was hanging out  for a little while  with Sherrod and Rachel Feintz.  I have a picture in the cellar  that Manny took  of me and David Lee Roth.  I look like I'm fucking 15.  Really?  Yeah, I want to get a copy of it.  I never got a copy.  Oh boy.  I really do look boyish and creepy.  Repart on CNN.  Repart's on CNN right now, yeah. 
[02:03:00]  You know, he made this up.  These photos are made up.  I would have been there  to grill him.  But I ended up becoming,  you know, just like everybody else,  witness to something  that felt tragic and sad  at an unbelievable level.  It was tragic and sad.  But for you,  I imagine it was also vindication.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes, it was.  You think he smells like booze?  You had said earlier  when you were speaking  that you wanted an apology from him.  A little bit of wine.  And that you also had other photos, 
[02:03:30]  including one that was extremely graphic  that you felt would be detrimental  to his family,  which is why you didn't release it.  What is this?  You seem to link the two,  the apology and perhaps  the release of it.  No, I mean, look,  I honestly feel  that there's no reason  to be as cruel.  You know, I guarantee you  if they had the photo of me,  they would have put it out there.  I am not the cruel person  that the media and people,  certain people on the left  think that I am. 
[02:04:00]  Well, so he's hinting  that he's not going to send  that graphic shot anywhere.  It says,  another graphic photo,  Breepark claims to have  more representative wiener pics.  Huh.  Interesting.  Maybe he will.  You think he will sit on it?  That's guaranteed.  Yeah, we'll see this picture.  The problem is  it's out there a little too much now.  I would say.  Because the guy that was  showing Ann Coulter  wasn't Breepark.  It will somehow get out there  because there is more  than just one person  that has it.  Oh, okay.  That's all I know about it. 
[02:04:30]  So you think if he resigns today,  it won't get out there?  No, no.  If he holds out  and says,  I'm not resigning,  then it goes out?  No, I think it goes out  regardless.  Either way.  Whether it's, you know,  in a week or a month,  I don't know,  but it's got to get out there.  No matter what.  Were you impressed  by the picture?  It was,  it wasn't embarrassing,  but it wasn't anything spectacular.  But Anthony's packing.  So we got to grade  his answer on a curve. 
[02:05:00]  I would say,  yeah,  nothing to be embarrassed by,  but not like,  holy shit,  you know.  Look how he has his hands right now.  He's ashamed all the time.  I'm shaming.  He's trying to cover up all the time.  He's trying to cover up.  In that box of briefs,  in those boxes,  briefs or whatever,  he had,  it looked,  they looked like he had a big one.  If you plump up  and push it down to the side like that,  you'd be surprised  it could almost pop out the leg.  That's the picture.  What did you show him?  It looks black.  What did you show him?  You didn't show me.  Oh. 
[02:05:30]  A big shit?  No, it was a cock photo.  Oh, well,  I thought it was another one of your shits.  It does look black.  It was turgent.  I love the word turgent.  Oh, God.  All right,  we should break then.  All righty.  More with Jim Florentine.  Sugar Ray Leonard's coming by.  You're a big boxing fan,  huh?  Yeah, I like Sugar Ray.  Absolutely.  Dumb question.  You know why the gloves are red?  Obviously,  obviously so the fighters could see,  you know,  the gloves, 
[02:06:00]  but why did they pick red?  I don't know.  I wonder if there's a real answer to that.  No idea.  Because there's a lot of bright colors out there  they could have picked.  That's another one of Jimmy's childish questions.  I'll ask him as soon as he walks in.  Why are the gloves red?  Why do you think the gloves are red?  Because they weren't back in the old days.  They were brown leather,  I think,  when they would fight,  like when Jack Johnson and those guys,  like right after the bare knuckles.  Gentleman Jim Corbett.  Oh, yeah.  I remember that guy.  When they would fight like,  I don't know,  like the Fighting Irish logo guy.  Or maybe once they went to plastic,  or whatever,  because they're not, 
[02:06:30]  are they made of leather anymore,  like the old ones were?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know what they're made of.  This is all we should ask Sugar Ray about.  Nothing about the molestation.  Just gloves.  Nothing about sex.  Some say he's the greatest fighter of all time.  Obviously on a lot of top five lists.  He's definitely in the top five.  Yeah.  What's your top five, Florentino?  I'm not a huge boxing fan,  but I don't,  you know.  You got to do Ali,  obviously.  You got to go Sugar Ray Robinson.  You got to go Muhammad Ali.  I love Frazier.  I don't know Frazier.  It's a top five.  Joe Lewis.  Damn ghost Frazier. 
[02:07:00]  You might have to do Joe Lewis over Frazier.  No, no way.  Why not Tyson?  Not even close.  Top five?  No, because you got guys like Julio Cesar Chavez  that I think went 80-0 at one point,  and fuck it,  or Roberto Duran.  You can't just go on record, though.  No, but Marciano is 50-0.  Larry Holmes 49-0 before he lost.  Just some amazing fighters.  Tyson just had,  I mean, when Tyson fought in his heyday,  no one missed it.  You fucking got the pay-per-view.  He fucked up his legacy, though.  He fought a lot of bums.  The first, like, 20 fights. 
[02:07:30]  You ever seen him on ESPN,  these old fucking Irish white guys  from, like, Boston  that got pulled out of a pub?  People beaters.  You don't even want to look.  You're like, oh,  this is round one.  The fucking bell rings.  Like, this guy's going to get destroyed.  You didn't go to the bathroom.  You didn't do anything.  When that fight started,  you had to be sitting right in front of the television.  There was no muscle mass on him?  No.  Tyson never fought guys like fucking Ernie Shavers.  He never fought guys like Ali.  He never fought guys like George Foreman,  Joe Frazier. 
[02:08:00]  That's who was around.  It wasn't his fault.  True.  But he beat up, like, Marvis Frazier,  Larry Holmes when he was 71.  It's like fucking...  71.  Do you know what I mean?  Like, Ali had to fucking fight 15 rounds  with a broken jaw against Ken Norton.  These guys fucking fought monsters, man.  They were all tough dudes back then.  Yeah.  Tyson's first 20 fights were like,  guys look like Colin Quinn.  And then he lost to Buster.  Wish it was Colin.  Yeah, so do I.  Those thin, breakable fingers.  Oh, God.  Colin's fingers would break like a fucking...  If he threw a punch, 
[02:08:30]  his fingers would break like a tennis ball  that you've frozen cryogenically.  Like a fist made of breadsticks.  Ah.  Independent glove...  Thanks, Travis.  Independent glove makers,  Ray Flores and Sammy Frager,  made red gloves in the 50s and 60s  so they found the traditional black  or maroon colored gloves  were harder to see landing  to the audience in attendance.  Ah.  So it had nothing to do with the fighters.  No, it was just something...  Just so you could watch...  I pointed out before.  So you could see him getting hit better.  You know, we always want credit  when we say the right thing.  I just wanted credit  because I pointed that out. 
[02:09:00]  So what's your top five, Jimmy, quickly?  Again, I'm going to have to say...  You could adjust your list, obviously, but...  And this is not necessarily the ones I love.  Ali, obviously.  Sugar Ray Robinson.  Joe Lewis.  I would probably put Sugar Ray Leonard in there.  I'm debating Sugar Ray Leonard in the top five.  Definitely top ten, top five, maybe.  Chuck Webner.  Fucking the bleeder.  The Bayonne bleeder.  I know.  Webner rocked.  The Bayonne bleeder.  Remember him?  Oh, yeah, I do. 
[02:09:30]  Just fucking...  That guy was unbelievable.  Ravaged with blood.  What about Foreman with the big comeback he did?  I'm thinking of Foreman.  Foreman might be one of the greatest of all time  because he beat up a lot.  Dude, he destroyed Frazier.  He destroyed Ken Norton.  Destroyed him in two rounds.  And he should have beaten Ali.  If that dummy didn't listen to Ali,  talk to him,  he would have murdered Ali.  And he should have beaten Ali.  So, yeah, Foreman would be in my top five list.  Tyson would not be.  Joe Frazier wouldn't be.  I don't even know if Sugar Ray would be in my top five. 
[02:10:00]  He might be the fifth one in that list.  We should ask him.  Yeah.  I guarantee he'll say Ali and Sugar Ray Robinson.  Those two are without a doubt he'll put in.  And Joe Lewis.  Those three he'll put in.  And Peter McNeely.  Yeah, of course.  Oh, God.  You got to put him up.  And Tommy Morrison.  McNeely.  He's got to be part of any list.  Fucking McNeely.  We used to talk to him.  Oh, God.  Was he a dope?  We were working in Boston,  and he was fighting Tyson,  and the whole fucking city was around Peter McNeely.  Yeah.  You could do this.  You could do this, Peter.  The great white dope.  He almost believed he could do it himself. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  I'm going to go in there,  and I'm going to fight my best.  Bam.  How many rounds did he last?  Not one.  Not one.  Yeah, I'm not sure.  I think it was an early first round knockout.  It was an early first rounder.  Just pounded his fucking pale Boston face.  Yeah.  We had Jerry Cooney.  Looney Cooney.  The pride of Long Island.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Used to wander around Huntington in between fights.  Looney Cooney.  And Jerry Quarry.  Jerry, well, Quarry, sure. 
[02:11:00]  Rock Quarry.  But I am Rock Quarry.  Cooney, though.  You remember.  Oh, yeah, absolutely, Cooney.  And Jerry Quarry.  Didn't Jerry Quarry used to fight a lot in the 70s?  Yeah.  Because he got beaten up by a lot of guys.  He fought everyone.  But Pryor had a funny joke.  He was like,  Jerry Quarry loves getting beat up by niggers.  That was such a funny thing to say.  I guess he lost a lot to this guy.  Holy shit.  He lost everyone.  I was like,  what a funny fucking thing to say.  He loves it.  Yeah.  But we all know Jerry Quarry's name.  Would you put Marciano on the top? 
[02:11:30]  I don't know.  Maybe not.  The problem is,  we didn't really see those guys fight.  So it's tough.  He went 50-0.  I know.  50.  But then again,  Julio Cesar fought a lot more guys.  In our lifetime,  you know,  I picked the guys that I saw fighting.  Roberto Duran,  you might put in that list.  Duran was an animal.  He was a tremendous fighter.  The No-Moss motherfucker.  What about Hagler?  Marvin Hagler.  I was just thinking of Hagler.  Although Duran beat,  I mean,  I think Duran,  didn't Duran beat Hagler?  And I think Leonard beat Hagler.  Leonard beat Hagler.  I think in a decision.  All right.  How about this?  Top five heavyweights of all time. 
[02:12:00]  Makes it easier.  Ollie Foreman,  Joe Lewis.  Does Tyson now make that list?  No.  Joe Frazier probably.  Frazier over Tyson?  Absolutely.  Oh,  God,  yeah.  Joe Frazier over Tyson?  I would take that,  because I think that Joe Frazier  would have beat Tyson.  Even though Tyson was a really,  and there's probably boxing guys  that know more than I do  to think I'm an asshole,  but Tyson was extremely underrated  as a boxer.  He was really fucking fast.  He like,  with his legs,  he would put,  he had a fucking,  it was like a steam shovel punch. 
[02:12:30]  Bulldog,  yeah.  But I just don't know,  because Frazier was a bobber.  I don't know if he could have  taken Frazier beating.  If Tyson hung in there  for two more years  before he lost his fucking mind,  he would be considered  one of the greatest ever.  He would have to beat guys.  He got,  he started getting weird  in his prime.  Dude,  but he got beat up  by Buster Douglas.  I was like a Larry Holmes.  Larry Holmes should be.  He lost to Buster Douglas,  and then when he came back  from jail,  look,  Ali came back  after a three-year layoff  and beat fucking Frazier,  and he beat Foreman.  Tyson came back 
[02:13:00]  and got beat up  by Lennox Lewis.  He lost to Holyfield twice,  I think.  He just lost his fucking  will to everybody.  Just sucked.  Well,  that Buster Douglas fight  in the documentary  to Tyson,  he says he was just in  wherever China or Japan,  wherever they fought,  he was just partying  with strippers and hookers  the whole time.  Didn't train at all.  Oh, shit.  He got there like three weeks early  and just fucked like  20 chicks a night.  Was James Brown singing  Living in America  and take your picture  with fucking...  Can we play Tyson  saying he doesn't want  to fight anymore?  It's the most depressing  sports moment ever.  You ever hear this, Jim? 
[02:13:30]  I don't think so.  I love Tyson, too.  I don't know who he lost to  at this point.  It was obviously  his last fight, I guess.  Praise be Allah.  I just don't want to do this.  I just don't want to do this.  I ain't got the heart  finished on here, man.  I don't have the heart.  It's so sad.  I won't just raise my pigeons.  Now he's a vegan.  Is he really?  It's like 50 pounds, yeah.  He was in Vegas,  got married, yeah.  Holy shit.  We have that somewhere.  Can I have the endive salad  and eat?  Like some...  You have some kind of vinaigrette? 
[02:14:00]  You didn't see him  eat like a chick.  Yeah.  Then he eats the plate with it  and the fucking...  I mean utensils.  Let's see.  Four carrots in each hand.  It just never ends.  It never ends.  My drive home  when I'm home  watching TV.  I'm guessing 
[02:14:30]  Leonard's get...  They're going to guess  his top five?  Oh.  Yeah.  We're just trying to find  the Tyson thing  so we're going to...  Quit.  Would he put Duran  in the top five?  I don't think so.  But I mean,  would he put...  Duran was ridiculous.  Then again,  would he put...  Nah, he wouldn't put  Floyd Mayweather,  I don't think.  Duran was like a gladiator.  He's going to put  a couple guys  that he got influenced by  growing up  that he watched.  Sugar Ray and Ali,  definitely.  Yeah.  All right,  maybe we'll play  the Tyson thing  after the break. 
[02:15:00]  Gotta find it.  Florentine,  what are we promoting?  Anything in general?  Yeah, I'm doing  my one-man show  in New York City.  Fuck, how's that?  Players Theater.  It's right by the  Comedy Cellar upstairs  for anybody that knows.  It's between Cafe Wa  and the Cellar  on McDougal Street  and the Cellar is  117 McDougal  so this is right  next to that.  They're like 115.  Next Monday,  June 13th,  8 o'clock.  What makes this  different than  regular stand-up?  It's like an  autobiography of my life.  And you can talk  for a while, right?  Yeah, it's more stories 
[02:15:30]  than just dick jokes.  You touch on  the guy  molesting you  at the wrestling match?  Oh yeah,  it's a big part  of the show.  I got all the pictures.  I got a screen going  so I show a slideshow  so I got all the pictures.  I show which picture.  I had this  Simon Coloff one.  I kissed him on the cheek  for this one.  Oh, you got pictures?  Oh yeah,  I got the original pictures.  Oh yeah,  Bruno San Martino bleeding  so I sat on his lap.  God damn,  that's good.  Oh yeah,  that could be the whole show. 
[02:16:00]  That is funny, man.  I heard that  recently  when you told that story  on this show.  I heard that recently  on Best Of,  yeah.  And I was in the car  laughing my ass off.  Really?  It's so funny  and tragic  and just creepy.  Well, see,  that's the thing.  I can't do that.  I try to do that story  in a regular comedy club  and people are almost sobbing.  I'm like,  don't feel bad for me.  It's fucking funny.  It's hilarious.  I can only do it  in a theater  at a one-man show  where they're coming  to see that  because they're like, 
[02:16:30]  what the fuck?  Oh my God.  This is terrible.  What do we come to see?  It's awesome.  It's fucking hilarious.  We got the clips.  You want to play them  before break?  What the hell?  So this is Tyson's  last fight  and what he said  right after it.  First clip.  Oh, I'm not interested  in fighting no more.  Listen,  I'm not trying to take  anything from Kevin McBride.  We know his record.  We know his credentials.  And if I can't beat him,  I can't even beat Junior Jones.  Wow.  What a backhanded compliment  like this lunk beat me.  We never really heard  from Kevin McBride 
[02:17:00]  after this, right?  No, where'd he go?  I barely know the name.  Clip 2.  I can't do this no more.  You know what I mean?  I'm not going to lie to myself.  I'm not going to embarrass  this sport.  This is a great sport.  This sport that took men  with pretty humble lives  and humble beginners  and put them in a position  to rub shoulders  with royalty.  I'm not going to embarrass  this sport any more  than it is.  Wow.  Any more than it is.  I love Tyson, man.  I really do.  I don't know.  People have such a weird  affection for him.  I guess because he was  in our lifetimes  he was the potential. 
[02:17:30]  We saw the potential  for absolute greatness.  Yeah.  And it's like even weird.  Even when he fought  later in life  you were always  you were hoping  it would come back.  Yeah.  You were hoping to undo  what had been done  and it just couldn't be  undone.  You're absolutely right.  You wanted to see him  charge out of that corner  like he used to  just beat the fucking  piss out of somebody  and then you're watching  five rounds go by  six rounds.  He's getting tired.  It's like,  oh, what happened  to the guy?  He was, you know.  When you were growing up  did you like or hate  Ali at first?  Loved him. 
[02:18:00]  I hated him.  Loved him.  And then I forgot  what happened.  There was a fight  where I completely turned  and then for the rest  of his career  I was rooting for him.  Oh, I loved Ali.  There was a turning point  with him  and how I felt about him.  Watching Frazier's documentary  about the thriller  in Manila  you see the other side  of Ali  where he was not likable.  I mean,  he was just a guy  promoting a fight  and guys on the other  side of him  were like,  fuck this guy, man.  Like Frazier was  making fun of his family  and all that stuff.  And calling him  like a monkey  and saying that he was  an Uncle Tom sellout.  And meanwhile,  fucking Frazier's not 
[02:18:30]  from some white neighbor.  He's from the fucking  streets of Philly  and he helped Ali  when Ali was out of boxing.  He gave him money.  He gave him money and shit.  I think Cosell put Ali over  also.  Like made him more likable  with people  because it was  they played off each other.  It was like fucking comedy  going back and forth.  Yeah, the same thing  for Sugar Red Leonard.  You're ugly.  We call him ugly  and make fun of his wig  and try to pull his wig  off his head.  He's like,  Mohammed!  Mohammed!  What are you doing?  And he'd have to  hold on to his hair.  It was a hoot.  Yeah, you don't get 
[02:19:00]  that anymore.  After Ali left,  Sugar Red Leonard  was the guy that  Cosell kind of loved.  Went with.  Yeah, a lot of fighters  resented that  because they thought  that he was just  this fucking Hollywood  kind of pretty boy fighter  that was made popular  by the media and Cosell.  They just showed Sugar Ray  on TV.  He's making the rounds  before us, obviously.  Yeah.  How old is he?  He looks...  He's got to be in his 50s.  He's mid-50s.  Wow.  53, maybe.  Holy shit, really?  We're pushing 60  at this point, Jimmy.  No, I...  I would say 70s  if we're going to  keep just going up.  Does he have a picture  with Groucho Marx? 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, he pictures  with Groucho.  More Tyson clips.  Is this the last one?  One to go?  You have two more.  Two more?  All right, here's  one more Tyson clip.  I'm comfortable with my stigma here.  I know who I am  and I know what people  think about me.  Listen, I may be bizarre  sometimes, but I'm very rational.  I'm extremely rational  and I understand my situation.  I understand my situation now.  I understand the situation  of this country.  And I'm not going to lie to myself  and you shouldn't allow me  to do that as well.  I'm comfortable 
[02:20:00]  with my stigmatism.  I'm comfortable  with my stigmata.  I'm bleeding from the hands  and my tootsies.  Can't tell them apart.  I don't know what happened  but I'm comfortable.  I'm listening to these clips  going something's wrong.  This is from the press conference.  This isn't like in the ring.  We usually play the audio  right after he lost  and he's like pretty much  breaking down.  In the ring, yeah, yeah.  That's the one I really want to hear  maybe after the break. 
[02:20:30]  I have those too if you want.  You have those too.  Well, those are the ones  we wanted.  Those are the ones we wanted,  Iraq.  All right, the final clip.  50-50 shot and again  Iraq flips the coin  and wah, wah.  Final clip of this batch  and then we'll play the one  we really wanted to hear.  Sometimes people think  I'm not handling my responsibility.  I may not want to spend  as much time with my kids  but I have to be happy.  I don't want them  to be around me  and I'm not happy.  I need to be happy  and the only way I'm happy  is when I'm contributing.  You don't want to be around him  when he's not happy  I would think.  I'm feeling a little unhappy today. 
[02:21:00]  Whose head want to go  through a wall?  I miss Tyson on this show.  Oh God.  He's kind of out of,  you know,  until Hangover  he was out of the picture.  And it's fucking Tyson bits  from Manny W.  Oh my God.  My first memory of this show  is being in the car.  Oh my God.  I thought you guys were dicks  because you were doing  a Dice impression  and I loved Andrews  so I was like,  fuck these assholes.  Yeah.  And then I'm in the car  driving down the turnpike  to a gig  and I hear Anthony 
[02:21:30]  doing Tyson  and I'll be on top  of the Empire State Building  swatting airplanes  and I'm like,  oh my God.  This guy's fucking hilarious.  I was so annoyed.  The first one was  the Queen.  The Queen.  When he went over to England  and he,  the story was  he went over to England  and he said something  that upset like people  because they thought  it was derogatory  to England and the Queen.  And of course  that little thing  led to, you know,  I want to fuck  your princess up 
[02:22:00]  her asshole  and it just got  way out of fucking hand.  Well, we're going  to be hearing it.  Your Queen is a whore.  We're going to hear that  in the 10 o'clock hour today.  Ah, in the shit hour  as I like to call it.  The Sam Roberts  shit hour.  Here's the clip  we really wanted  right after he lost  to Kevin McBride.  Yeah.  I'm just sorry  I let everybody down.  I just don't have  this in my heart anymore.  I don't have this  in my heart anymore.  That's most likely  I'm not going to fight anymore.  I'm not going to  disrespect the sport anymore 
[02:22:30]  by losing  to this caliber of fighters.  I don't have that ferocity.  I'm not an animal anymore.  I'm not an animal anymore.  I'm not an animal anymore.  That was kind of sad.  I have evolved.  Because you don't see  a sports guy like,  you know,  Donovan McNabb  throw a four interception  and go,  I'm done.  I can't play anymore.  You don't never hear that.  Right after emotional,  right after a game.  Very rarely.  I'm not an animal anymore.  Look at the chart.  I'm the third one  from the left now.  I was the second, 
[02:23:00]  but now I'm almost  standing upright.  And Jim Florentine  on Twitter?  Yeah,  Mr. Jim Florentine.  Mr. Jim Florentine.  And I do a podcast now.  All you guys do a podcast?  Yes.  I did Jim's podcast.  All you guys do a podcast?  Yeah, actually.  Yeah, man.  It's cool.  Actually,  your podcast is doing really well.  Yeah,  it hit number 55  on the charts.  How many people is that?  I don't know.  I don't want to know.  55.  It's a comedy podcast. 
[02:23:30]  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, it's great, dude.  Yeah, I've only been doing it  a couple months.  We're coming after you guys.  You know that.  I saw you guys.  You guys are hanging on the charts.  I see you in the charts.  We're in the charts for what?  Yeah, it's an iTunes chart  for a comedy podcast.  We're not really doing podcasts yet,  but we're coming after you.  Something's there, though.  It says Opie and Anthony something.  I don't know exactly what it is.  I don't know exactly what it is.  It's going on.  Interesting.  Really?  I don't have anything on iTunes.  Well, you know who has the most won  is Corolla's got the  most popular podcast in the world.  Is he making money yet? 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, because he's got advertisers.  He's finally making money.  And then he charges, I guess,  after like a couple weeks,  like two bucks a podcast.  So you can make some money.  Can you upload video podcasts  onto iTunes?  Yep.  Okay.  See, that's what I got to do.  If I do a compound show,  I got to pop it up there.  Yeah, absolutely.  See what the hell.  How long is that Corolla's podcast?  An hour?  Yeah, it does an hour.  Wait, once a day?  Yeah, I think it does  like four or five days a week.  That's like a good length.  Just an hour.  Just an hour.  Pop on.  Just an hour.  No joke.  Two hours tops  is all you need to do these days. 
[02:24:30]  People don't have time  to sit through this shit  every day.  Four hours?  What are you kidding me?  You do 45 minutes to an hour.  Get your shit out there  and move on.  Some of mine are like  18 minutes.  Play golf or something.  Perfect.  Just get on.  I just fucking rant  and that's it.  It's over.  Some are 45 an hour.  I think that's the way to go.  Because what?  I mean, we'll be fucking dragging  for the next hour now.  No, you.  Just fucking around.  I'm just warming up  when he gets here.  Oh, yeah.  You got another question?  So, do you think  that footwork helps?  Why are you yelling  your questions to Sugar Ray? 
[02:25:00]  I get nervous.  I want to make sure  he hears me.  Oh.  I panic.  Andrew's busy.  But he can come in tomorrow.  What do you mean he's busy?  Tomorrow's a bad day.  You know why.  He's crazy busy.  We got wire guys.  We got Glenn Close.  Is she still coming?  We got to separate the two  because the wire people  are the Glenn Close people.  I don't know if that works.  What time?  How about we blow off  Glenn Close?  That's what I was saying.  Jim doesn't have a picture with her.  I do.  Oh, then then blah, blah, blah.  At Dane Cook's HBO's better.  Here's what we got.  9.30 tomorrow,  we got Vincent D'Onofria. 
[02:25:30]  We have to take D'Onofria.  Of course.  We're dying to talk to him  from fucking Full Metal Jacket  and the Law and Order.  Of course.  Law and Order,  but I don't acknowledge the Law and Order.  It's all Full Metal Jacket.  All Full Metal Jacket.  And then,  because Anthony and I  are doing this  wire paintball thing  this Saturday.  It's 8 a.m. to noon.  It's right over the bridge in Queens.  You play a fucking paintball  at the Wirecast  and we can't fucking...  I've never played paintball.  So we're trying to get some listeners.  You are going to hurt.  I know,  but it's going to be fun.  Oh,  until you get hit.  As an individual,  you can do it too, 
[02:26:00]  by the way.  It's not just teams.  You can join as an individual  and they'll team you  with other people.  So we have a few of those guys  coming in tomorrow.  We don't even know who.  We had Glenn Close.  But see,  I like Glenn Close,  but the Wire guys  are much more of a fit for us  than she is.  So I want to move her back.  How about we move her back  out the door?  Can we just agree  that maybe  it's not a good fit  and especially tomorrow  it's a little hectic.  What time is she coming in?  I don't want to rush  the Wire guys  because Glenn Close is here.  If they get here  8.15 or 8.20, 
[02:26:30]  I don't want to have...  You got Roland panicking.  But look,  from one office  to the other office,  that's never good.  Roland.  If she can't come in earlier,  then she should come in  another time.  I mean,  I would love to talk to her,  but I could care less.  Have her on the phone yard.  Is that the way to say that?  Yeah,  she's a Megadeth fan.  Yeah,  she's got to be.  I have her play  a few records  of her own.  What would you ask  Glenn Close?  I could...  I can't ask her.  I don't know.  Roland's not on it.  His arms are to the side.  Look at him.  You're putting me  in a Pepsi.  They don't want it. 
[02:27:00]  But I've already confirmed  you could just do a favor  for me.  It's one of those things  that you're a favor for.  If you could just  fit her in and stuff,  it wouldn't be a problem.  If you could get somebody else  I'm still cleaning up  a lot of damage  that you guys caused  with that one.  This is not a good time  to do this to me  because it's only going  to hurt me  and they're claiming  I might be fired.  Sounds like you guys  are doing a dude  from office space.  Yeah,  that's well...  Bring him in.  Roland!  Roland, Roland, Roland! 
[02:27:30]  Stabler?  She's in at 8.30.  Roland.  How about not?  Wait, why is she in at...  Can we say no to her?  We have to blow her off.  Tomorrow's much too busy.  Wait, why is she in at 8.30  if D'Onoffi is 9.30?  Yeah.  No.  Because then she's 8.30 to what?  And then when do  the Wire guys come in?  The Wire's not confirmed yet.  They're still waiting  for an answer  when they'll come in.  But okay,  so say she's in 8.30.  When would they come in?  I don't know.  They're waiting for confirmation.  Danny's working on that.  Because we would have  to move her then 
[02:28:00]  because I don't want them squeezed  because she's here.  But if they all could...  No, no.  Not with those guys and her.  No.  I would say...  They just actually had  the big publicist.  I would say...  Hey, hey, publicist.  Publicist, schmublicist.  I'll tell you why.  I like the publicist.  We need the publicist.  But look what just happened  with Paris Hilton.  The publicist is not  taking the hit for that.  They're not acknowledging  their client was awful.  It's like...  But that's too different.  You're comparing Oscar  and a reality person.  Oscar and reality...  You want to ask her.  Apples and cunts. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  But Oscar and reality person  doesn't matter  if it works for the show.  Like, it doesn't...  It doesn't matter what...  Because look,  the Indy 500 guy  was better than the Oscar winner  and the reality person.  Of course.  No, and we didn't know  he'd be that good.  He was great for this show.  But yeah, I know she won  the Oscar for, what,  Fatal Attraction?  Yeah.  But I mean, she doesn't work  as well for us  as the Wire guys do.  I can't...  I don't know what to...  And she won't come in early,  like around 8 o'clock.  She won't come in at 745.  I got a solution.  What?  Ronnie B. 
[02:29:00]  Ah.  Ronnie B to the rescue.  Ronnie B could take her.  Right?  Not at that time.  What?  What do you mean  not at that time?  Tell Ronnie to come in early  and help us out.  Jury duty.  Oh, he's on jury duty.  Oh, he's got the jury.  Yeah.  The grand jury thing.  All right, we'll figure it out.  Oh my God.  More importantly,  Kingston Pete on Twitter  came up with the top five boxers.  You ready for this list, Jimmy?  Yes.  This is going to trump yours.  Number five,  the red Rock'em Sock'em robot.  Number four,  Leaping Lanny Poffo. 
[02:29:30]  Dave Ressler.  This isn't working?  I'm trying to think of words  to describe.  This isn't working yet?  No.  How about number three,  Clover Lang?  I recognize the name.  Clover Lang.  That was cute.  Hey, woman.  Hey, woman.  Hey, what are you the real man?  Come home.  Who are you, man?  You and that chump  know what I had to go through?  Right.  Two, Lou Gossett Jr.?  Anyone?  Lou Gossett Jr.  Officer and a gentleman?  Officer and a gentleman.  He kicked some ass. 
[02:30:00]  He kicked some fucking ass.  Mayonnaise.  Then he got kicked in the balls.  Oh, no, he kicked in the balls.  He kicked mayonnaise  right in the balls.  But it's hard to fight  when you've got a gerbil  in your ass.  I get it because  that happened.  Number one,  Tony Danza.  Come on.  What?  From Taxi.  And he was a real boxer, though.  Wasn't he really?  Oh, right.  Golden Gloves.  There's a cockpit of him  in the locker room.  He's fucking standing there.  He's got a huge fucking hog.  He does?  You want to see Tony Danza's hog?  He's got that Dago tuna can,  I think.  It's, uh... 
[02:30:30]  Did he?  What is your fucking filter on?  Exactly.  For no deliciousness.  There's Tony Danza.  Wow.  It's my unclipped cock.  That's a big dick  because he's out of the shower.  It's fucking...  He's in a locker room.  Yeah.  Who snapped that?  His balls are hanging.  Look how long...  They're hanging almost down  to his mule.  I know.  He's young, man.  You shouldn't have  fucking hangers like that.  Who snapped that fucking picture?  I don't know.  Like, he's in a locker room.  Another guy just like, 
[02:31:00]  hey, I gotta get this.  And you know, yeah,  because that's the 70s bush,  you know,  so it was a long time ago.  And those were the days  those pictures just went  into a folder,  into a file cabinet.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Someone found him  in an attic years later.  Right, right.  Hey, pop-up Tony Danza  in the Spider-Man suit.  Oh, yeah.  Was it on Halloween  on his talk show?  When he used to do  that horrible talk show,  he comes out  in a Spider-Man outfit  for Halloween.  And his fucking dick...  He's got just this big  fucking bulge  in front of these  New Jersey housewives.  Yeah, it's hilarious. 
[02:31:30]  Halloween.  We used to pop this up  every once in a while  just to fucking giggle.  From his talk show.  Yeah.  Let's see,  Tony Danza...  It was Spider-Man, right?  Yeah, just put  maybe Spider-Man  or something.  Spider-Man costume...  Costume?  Costume.  Yeah, put...  Costume.  Yeah, I figured out  the Glenn Close thing.  What?  We need another studio.  We franchised that shit.  Me and you  talked to The Wire.  Fake Opie and Anthony 
[02:32:00]  and Jim Norton  talked to Glenn Close.  Oh.  She'll never know.  Oh.  I like that.  Fake Opie and Anthony.  I like that a lot.  Who are we going to franchise  for this?  Florentine could play me.  You want to interview  Glenn Close as me tomorrow?  I'll do it.  Sam could be Anthony.  Who could play Anthony?  Gary Glitter,  Roman Polanski.  Anthony Wiener.  You see what would 
[02:32:30]  happen tomorrow?  She'll be in at 8.30  and then The Wire guy...  I don't know.  I told Roland  when we were  wandering around yesterday,  I'm like,  more important  because The Wire guys  will always be there for us.  Yeah.  Especially if we help them  out with this charity thing  they're doing with the paintball.  And you never know  when these guys  are going to have  that next big,  huge,  over-the-top project.  If Glenn Close  is one and done,  she don't give a fuck about us.  And we love those guys  and it's like  we're all fucking  obsessed with the show.  I'm saying...  Jim,  if you didn't have  a picture of Glenn Close,  would she be in the mix?  Blower off?  Yes.  Yeah,  but not for The Wire.  The Wire guys  would take priority  over most people.  Blower off. 
[02:33:00]  Believe me,  for those guys,  I love the show so much  that...  And you'd miss a picture  with Glenn Close.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We can't find the Tony Danza pic.  Isn't that weird?  Yeah.  You seen the picture?  The Tony Danza picture?  Yeah.  Was it bigger than Paul Veneers?  There's a comedian  that had this huge package  and me and Jim  wouldn't even care  about his jokes.  We'd just stare at his package  like when we'd open  for him in the back.  We'd ask him about it  and he would never...  He'd always get shy.  Like,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  He never wanted to talk about it.  Yeah,  yeah.  We'd just like,  look at that thing. 
[02:33:30]  We couldn't wait  to work with him.  Like,  work with Paul Veneers.  This is fucking awesome.  We're going to look  at his package.  Jim would call me.  How big was it?  I go,  it was huge.  That's great.  Yeah,  that's all we were talking about  was Paul Veneers' penis.  It really was a huge fucking...  We were like,  what is that?  Well,  we do that with Jonathan.  We're this close  to poking it  when he takes us out  to his tight European pants.  He's Jim's manager too,  so Jim knows.  Jim has seen  that fucking side bulge.  How bad do you want  to just poke it  with your index finger?  I know.  But it's been  in foreign countries,  I'm afraid to touch it. 
[02:34:00]  I don't know what it's got.  I'm going to guess  Jonathan has  maybe nine by six.  Nine by six?  Yeah,  Jonathan has a big,  awful penis.  I know he does.  I know he does.  He alluded to it one time  in all the years  I've known him  as a joke,  like quoting some other girl.  You think he's got girth?  Yeah,  that's what he's saying.  He has to.  It's like a water balloon.  It's like a fucking water balloon.  Water balloon.  It's awful.  You don't want to have  a water balloon.  No,  but it's all over the place.  A water balloon  before the middle,  you lose the middle  and it starts blowing up  from the middle. 
[02:34:30]  It's awful.  No reason for that.  It's not fair.  I'll ask him,  I'll find out.  He'll be in town  for the show.  Kenny.  Oh,  he's got boxing gloves.  Yes.  How many boxing gloves  would you say you have signed?  Not actually,  I started this  at a boxing event  where I got a whole bunch  of them to sign gloves.  Yeah.  I don't have,  honestly not that many.  I have Joe Frazier,  Roy Jones Jr.,  Bernard Hopkins,  Shane Mosley.  You only have one  Bernard Hopkins.  I have two  from the first time  I came in.  Oh,  because you gave me  one of your Bernard Hopkins. 
[02:35:00]  I'll have Sugar Ray.  Not too many actually.  I don't have a massive collection.  I wish one of the boxes  would be like,  I have to put it on  to sign it  and then he puts it on  and just punches you  in the face with it.  That would be hilarious.  You know what's going to be  great about all this shit?  No,  but I like the fact  that Anthony said  when the boxer puts it on,  I didn't know  where that was going.  I know.  What an idiot.  I know.  Why would you want him  to do that?  Because I would laugh though.  I don't blame you.  I'd feel bad for you,  but it would be funny  to watch a big boxer  punch you in the face.  I was watching,  Sugar Ray's not a big dude.  He fought at like 150, 
[02:35:30]  something like that.  I was watching  some of his old footage.  Holy fuck  did he punch fast, man.  Yeah.  The fact that these are like,  you know.  That's what it is.  He had speed like crazy.  Pitching yourself flailing  as a joke.  Yeah.  He was doing that  but hitting another fighter  accurately.  It was frightening  how good he was, man.  There are certain things  that boxers like,  it's their specialty.  His was speed.  Then there was,  you ever see,  I can't tell you  who did these things,  but you ever see  a big fucking heavyweight boxer  that gets in close  and gives those short 
[02:36:00]  fucking right hands  to the face  where it's just like,  he's not getting any  real throw on it.  Foreman did that.  But fucks people up.  Foreman would do that.  He would just throw  these lumbering punches  and you'd see him sometimes  and you know it hurts  just because you know  it's Foreman,  but you wouldn't realize  how badly he was hurting  somebody until,  I mean,  you saw Frazier.  He knocked on that  six times.  He humiliated Frazier.  And Tyson would get in there  with those fucking uppercuts.  If you get slammed  in the chin  with a Tyson uppercut,  you know what that's  got to feel like 
[02:36:30]  in your sinuses  and your head  and your teeth.  That fucking just,  you are out.  I'm fucking crazy.  Who does that for a living?  I think Foreman  would have pounded Tyson though.  Yeah?  Absolutely.  Yeah?  Because Frazier  had that type of a duck  and really hard to hit style.  Let's go to the computer match  and see.  Don't they would do that?  Match him up with a computer.  And by round three,  Ali is getting tired.  He says,  shut up.  It's a video game.  Stop it.  I have to pee.  You brought boxing gloves  to get signed? 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, I just get one sign.  You know what's going to be great?  Jim's going to meet some girl.  Here it is.  Oh, that's...  He's trying to hide it.  There's a better one.  There's a better one?  Yeah, I think so.  I've got to find it.  He's trying to hide it  with his Spider-Man mask.  Yeah.  But you can see it  poking out the side.  I realized Tony Danza  in his Spider-Man costume  for Halloween.  and his cock  was fucking...  We realized it was a bad idea.  Pounding through it.  And it wasn't a sock  or anything.  No, no.  It was just...  Because you could see  the outline of his fucking head 
[02:37:30]  and everything.  It was throbbing  from that audience.  Throbbing.  It was throbbing.  It was aching.  It's what he was  throwing web from.  All right, we got to break it.  You know what's going to be great  about Jim?  He's collecting all this shit  he's been doing a few years.  He's obsessed by it.  He's going to meet some chick  in a few years.  Oh, boy.  And they're going to get  a place together  whether it's this one  and all that shit's  going to be in storage.  Oh, man.  I mean, he's got fucking  kiss posters in his bedroom.  He's lucky he's got  that grandfathered in right now.  So if a chick moves in, 
[02:38:00]  he's like,  hey, it was already up.  Too fucking bad.  He's lucky  because no chick  wants a fucking kiss poster  in the bedroom.  Above the bed.  Above the bed.  That's even worse.  He's supposed to have some,  you know,  romantic picture.  Maybe a black woman nude  with a huge afro.  You've got to get  to Colorado.  You don't think a chick  is going to be happy  if I kiss poster?  No.  I'm telling you,  not a one.  If you guys ever  get a place together,  all that shit  will be in storage.  Oh, we got a break.  Yeah.  I got this.  All right.  I almost started doing a read. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, really?  I look at E-Rock.  I go, I go, read?  And he's like,  and he just stared at me 
[02:39:00]  and he was like,  no, you're back.  Oh, I get it.  Mid-show prep sheet.  Time.  Mid-show prep sheet.  Time.  So.  A man who tried to kill himself  at least ten times  finally succeeds.  Wow.  What's that about?  I don't know,  but it happened in Duarte, California.  He jumped,  oh, wow,  a man who died Friday  after jumping from a freeway overpass.  Now, that is a guy I respect.  Selfish fuck, though.  Oh, yeah, maybe not. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, I guess you're right.  I hate when they fuck other people up.  Florentine,  we did a whole suicide thing.  Yeah.  We're not a fan  of the stupid pills thing  because that's not really  trying to kill yourself.  No.  That's a cry for help  and waking up your siblings  and whatnot  in the middle of the fucking night  when they have jobs.  Jumpers suck  because they splat on the sidewalk  and people see it  and they're freaked out  for the rest of their life.  Hanging sucks  because the people that find you,  someone hanging  is a nightmare.  Someone has to cut you down.  You don't want to see that. 
[02:40:00]  A fucking gunshot,  again,  a huge mess.  You know who did it right?  Bradley Delp.  He fucking went into a room  with a barbecue,  sealed the fucking room off  and put a note on the door.  Hey, I'm killing myself.  Don't come in.  And who doesn't love  the smell of a barbecue?  So it's perfect for everybody.  So it smelled good.  Right.  You know?  And he put a note.  It's like, you know,  alert the police.  Don't come in.  So then, you know,  the pros go in.  You don't have to see  the guy laying there  all dead and shit.  So freeway overpass guy? 
[02:40:30]  That's greedy  because he, you know.  A little respect though  because there's no  coming back from that.  Well, that's true.  Jumpers I respect  because as soon as you  fucking decide  to step off that ledge,  it's over, Johnny.  A bridge jumper I don't mind,  but an overpass,  what if a car hits you?  No, that's true.  Shit like that.  And it was.  He was struck by  at least one vehicle  after leaping into  rush hour traffic.  Yeah, you fuck.  Now the guy's  got to live with that.  This fucking guy  tried ten times  to jump from  freeway overpasses  and other high places 
[02:41:00]  and finally he succeeded.  How do you try  jumping from a cinder block?  How do you try  jumping from high places?  Yeah, you don't try.  Yeah.  About the second floor  of a fucking house  into a pool.  I can't believe I'm alive.  He started on a curb.  Yeah.  Oh, there I go.  Worked his way up.  Sanchez has two  prosthetic legs  from when he broke  both ankles  jumping from the same  overpass in 2003.  Wow, this guy really...  Wow.  So congratulations  to him for finally doing it.  Why does he have  prosthetic legs  when he broke his ankles?  Must have broke them  really fucking bad.  He didn't have insurance  they just chopped them off. 
[02:41:30]  Be done with these things.  Civil war surgeon.  He really...  What a fucking depressing guy  he must have been  to be around.  Oh, man.  Right?  Mid-show prep sheet.  The second one,  Andrew Breitbart.  Yes.  Who should be on  our show tomorrow.  Yes.  He's a friend, I guess,  of certainly Anthony's.  That's great.  They were drinking  together last night.  The guy that broke  the whole Anthony Wiener thing.  He actually was very nice.  I didn't have to  get in touch with him  or anything.  He tweeted...  He tweeted...  He texted me.  Oh, what did he tweet you? 
[02:42:00]  No, well...  Yeah, right.  I should inadvertently  send him a dick pic.  Oops!  Oops!  Different Anthony.  Yes, yes.  That's not this Anthony, please.  Well, he'll be on tomorrow.  He's holding on  to the X-rated photo.  Yeah.  So now it's  openly being admitted  it's an X-rated photo  that someone in this room  may or may have not seen.  Well, I just know  there were more photos.  Did you see an X-rated photo, sir?  I know there were more photos  than were released  to the press. 
[02:42:30]  And I believe  I had seen  at least one of those photos.  Cockpick?  I'm not going to elaborate  on that, Greg O.P. Hughes.  I will not elaborate.  When I see it,  I'll not reveal my sources.  When I do see this picture,  I want to know  who's bigger.  Wiener or Anthony.  Oh.  I'll guarantee  it's fucking Cumia.  You think so?  Guaranteed.  Cumia for the win.  Cumia for the win.  Buy a helmet?  I would think  buy a helmet. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, I think  I could beat him  buy a helmet.  Are you bigger than this  banana that I'm holding, sir?  Where's it measuring from?  The taint?  No.  It doesn't curve like that, too.  It curves exactly  like the banana.  Is it that same  jaundice hepatitis color?  Little spots on it.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Little thumbtack marks  where fucking  where Rocky Dennis  was putting pins in it?  Because you told me  you put all the pins  in the European map.  Yeah.  Mom says I'm like a lion.  And then you fucked his face. 
[02:43:30]  You must play face.  I was going to go to London  with my,  and Anthony's penis.  We were going to ride  around Europe  with this big penis  on my shoulder  like a snake.  People would take  photos of it  instead of calling me  fat face  and punching me.  Brie Bard  is holding on  to the X-rated photo  of Wiener  as an insurance policy  against attacks  from Wiener.  That's great.  The good hands of people.  It's a joke.  Insurance humor  always gets them.  When do we see  the picture,  you think?  I honestly don't know, 
[02:44:00]  but if I was  to speculate,  I would say,  what day is it?  This afternoon?  It's Tuesday?  Mm-hmm.  I'm thinking  there's at least  going to be  a definitive  this is going out  by the end of the week.  End of the week?  I'm thinking today.  No, I would say  the end of the week.  They can't help themselves.  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  I'll bet this afternoon.  Really?  Yes.  And I don't know shit.  I'm going to take it again.  I wasn't out  with you guys  having fun 
[02:44:30]  and all that.  I have to pee  one more time.  Why?  You get nervous  before these big interviews.  Yeah, but I also drink  two big coffees  and two waters  and I have to piss badly.  You little hummingbird.  Yeah.  Do you guys talk?  I'll be back in a minute.  It's a little wee-wee.  We don't know how to talk  without you.  What?  No.  Wouldn't it be funny  if it was just dead silence  for three minutes  until I came back  and everybody just panicked?  Listeners wouldn't mind.  We might just do that now.  Assholes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  There you go.  I love it.  OK.  I don't know. 
[02:45:00]  I don't know. 
[02:45:30]  I don't know. 
[02:46:00]  I don't know. 
[02:46:30]  I don't know. 
[02:47:00]  I don't know.  I think he's going to be good, man.  He was on Dancing with the Stars, too.  Yeah.  Who's he, Ray?  Yeah, is he here?  Oh, God.  No, not yet.  But he's been being interviewed for years.  He's fine, man.  Yeah, we're excited to...  Oh, I have a good question.  Oh, you do?  What would you say defines the real Sugar Ray? 
[02:47:30]  The man behind the gloves.  Go.  Oh.  It's a very compelling question.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I thought he would be here by now.  What's that 930 yet?  Oh, okay.  So we were saying...  Yes, where were we?  Anthony Weiner had many of his...  Well, I'm just...  Because Jimmy was gone, so...  Yeah, Jimmy was gone, but he's back now. 
[02:48:00]  Jimmy, mid-show prep sheet, the last item that we were just discussing.  Anthony Weiner had many of his online conversations while his wife was out of the country with Hillary Clinton.  Exactly.  What's he supposed to do?  Fucking sit home while she's gallivanting in Europe?  Fucking telling Hillary, like, hey, your ankles look thinner.  I bet you that was her job to tape measure the ankles and see if they were...  Is there any difference between them and my thighs?  Yes, there's a good half-inch difference.  Yes, Jimmy!  Tuck him into her shoes with a shoehorn all the way around, just pushing meat in, leg meat. 
[02:48:30]  Now, you have to shuffle, because if you step up, the fat's going to pop out, and you're going to step on it.  What...  I'm sorry, Jim.  If she goes through TSA, they think there's something in her ankles.  You've got to frisk her ankles.  She's not even a hot wiener's wife.  She's not that hot.  No, she's...  Everyone's saying she's hot, but...  They keep saying she's hot, but...  She's all right.  I guess you're thinking about him and what he has.  Like a seven, maybe.  Yeah.  Six and a half.  After a shower, maybe a seven.  Girls really are an amazing thing, because...  You think? 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  They really kind of do put looks on a back burner sometimes.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  And guys?  Not so much.  Not so much?  Not so much.  You know, girls can look at a guy and be like, eh, well, he's got some cash.  Well, fuck him.  That's how I fucking get along.  You don't think it's your handsomeness?  You think it's more...  You think it's all smoke and mirrors?  I smoke and mirrors.  It's a little bit of my sparkling personality. 
[02:49:30]  My rampant racism attracts some nice Aryan-type girls.  Always, right?  But for the most part, yeah.  You're saying that you've got better-looking chicks now than when you were putting air-conditioning  ducts in?  Surprisingly.  Yeah.  When I was crawling around ceilings...  When you were crawling around ceilings, what were those girls on a scale of 1 to 10 on  an average?  Wow.  Like a 5 or a 6?  If I got a 6, I was fucking really happy.  You were rocking?  I was sporting 4s and 5s. 
[02:50:00]  4s and 5s?  4s and 5s, pretty much, yeah.  All right, but that's the middle of Long Island.  You get off work at Friday at 5, you're in a bar.  I guess a 4 and a 5 on Long Island is almost an 8.  You know?  That's an 8.  It really is a curve out there on Long Island.  At least a 6 or a 7.  And South Shore, it's a 10.  I did 4s and 5s as a goof every once in a while.  Yeah?  Just as a goof.  No, that was my fucking...  That was goof shit.  That was my hunting ground.  Wow, a really famous guy's walking down the hall.  Holy shit, it is. 
[02:50:30]  Fucking A, man.  Ladies and gentlemen, Sugar Ray Leonard.  Holy shit.  Sugar Ray.  That's a famous guy right there.  Wait, Jim's got to go piss again.  You got to pee?  Yeah, you okay?  No.  There he is.  Sugar Ray Leonard.  Come on in.  Join the show.  I thought you were lying.  No, he's right there, right behind you.  What's wrong with you, Jimmy?  Hey, Ray.  How are you?  How you doing?  How you doing?  God damn, you look great.  Jesus.  Pleasure.  Unbelievable.  Nice to meet you.  Sugar Ray Leonard.  We're on the air.  Great shape.  The Big Fight is the name of his book, My Life In and Out of the Ring, that he obviously 
[02:51:00]  is promoting.  Yeah.  And right off the bat, we've got to say, you look great.  Holy crap.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you so much.  I want to say, what do you do?  But then again, I don't know, he boxed, and he's a trainer, and he's in shape.  No, no, no, no, no.  That's a fair question.  He took care of himself.  But that's a fair question, because a lot of athletes, after they're done, they kind of  let themselves go.  You see it a lot.  I maintain.  I try to do something pretty much every day.  Not a lot, but just enough to keep the engine rolling.  I think it's all about attitude.  Yeah.  So when you stop fighting, did you go through a period where you just ate like a pig for 
[02:51:30]  a while, or did you just kind of maintain because you felt like you wanted to?  Well, you know, the first time I retired, many times.  Yeah, you really were in and out a lot.  I think I hold the record most times coming back.  What was the first time?  It was like right after you won.  Was it after you beat Benitez, or it was very early on?  No, my first comeback.  Okay, I retired in 82.  I came back in 84.  And then I retired after that fight and came back in 86. 
[02:52:00]  Then Hagler.  Then I retired.  I mean, just like, it's quite a few times.  Why were you getting out, though?  Because the book opens.  The book is great.  But on the Hagler fight, and I think you're walking into the ring and your mentality about  getting ready to fight Hagler.  Like, why did you keep getting out?  Were you worried about getting hurt, or did you just figure, I have enough money now?  Well, it's, you know, it wasn't even the money, thank God.  And it was, I was 25 when I first retired. 
[02:52:30]  Wow.  And what do you do?  I mean, I'm at the top of my game.  And my ophthalmologist who performed the surgery, because I had a detached retina.  The retina, yeah.  Yeah, he said, Ray, if you want to come back, you can.  Because the technology has gotten so much better, right?  And I was so sensitive towards the reaction from people saying, oh, he's coming back just  for the money, or the fame, whatever.  At that point in my life, I was coming back because it's my job.  I loved it.  So I came back, and I fought Kevin Howard. 
[02:53:00]  He knocked me down, unfortunately.  And I quit that same night.  I retired because I felt that I was not at my best.  Also, the punches hurt.  The punches hurt.  So wait, wait, when you fought Kevin Howard, you kind of made the announcement right after  the fight.  Did you regret that?  It's almost like when you buy a round for the house, you're like, I probably shouldn't  have said that.  I probably should have thought about it a little bit before I say it.  You know what?  That is so true.  That is so, that is so true.  When I said it, I said it because emotionally I was devastated because my pride was hurt. 
[02:53:30]  I was embarrassed by being knocked down for the very first time.  And it's like, that's it.  You know, I just don't have it.  And I retired.  And then months, I mean, days later or weeks later, I said, you know what?  That was so dumb.  Because I didn't give myself a chance to really look at the film and see what exactly happened.  And get past the emotion of having gotten hit like that and knocked down.  Because our head tells us a number of things, you know? 
[02:54:00]  And if you don't give yourself time, me personally, if I don't give myself time to really evaluate  what just took place, I make some irrational decisions.  Yeah, that's a rash, like quick decision to make on such an important thing.  I mean, that's your life, your career.  And just to, based on one moment like that, to cash it in, that is a little abrupt.  That is true, but with boxing, everything is instant because your reaction, the fans' reaction, 
[02:54:30]  everything is instant.  The knockout is instant.  Everything is instant.  So you don't have time, or you don't make time, to really think about what's next.  You understand what I'm saying?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like if you get, say for example, you fight Hagler or whatever, and he knocks me out.  And then after the fight, I got to say, all right, so what's next?  What's next?  I just got knocked out.  You're not thinking about what's next. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, what's next?  That is a dumb question.  I want you to say it, it's out there.  I never thought of what a dumbass question that is.  Yeah.  To ask a boxer after he's been knocked out.  Yeah, what's next is a good vacation.  What's next for you?  An ice pack on my skull, and why don't I just punch me in the face?  A plane to the Caribbean, that's what's next.  How long does it take you to recover from getting your ass beat in a fight?  But whether you won or lost, just a pounding, like do you have to stay in bed for two, three  weeks, you got concussions?  It's not that severe.  It's not like that.  I mean, that's television, that's movies, but it takes a while. 
[02:55:30]  And for me, like the Duran fight, 15 rounds of pounding and just, I mean, just absolutely  punishment.  It took me a couple weeks, a few weeks, to just get back.  You know, the contusions, the knots, and my pain, my ribs.  But I'm also 27 years old, so you bounce, you know, you bounce back.  Didn't Duran, too, you said, and the book covers a great amount of the mentality of the 
[02:56:00]  fight, which was really interesting to me to see what you guys think and what you were  going through.  Because I remember these fights when I was a kid, and Duran kind of got you, before the  fight ever started, he had you, because he kind of, he got in your head.  Yeah.  I mean, Duran, I mean, Duran was really, I was a very smart, clever guy.  And he, you know, he gave me gestures with his fingers, gave my wife gestures with his  fingers.  He cursed me out.  He pushed me, kicked me.  He did a lot of things.  And I was always kind of taught to smile when there was cameras around. 
[02:56:30]  So he's pushing me, kicking me, doing all these things.  He's insulting me, and I'm smiling.  So it was killing me inside that I let, because on the streets, you know, I fight you back.  Yeah, yeah.  But for some reason, I didn't do that.  So it bothered me for a long time.  And so the press tour we had, I didn't want to be around him, because I knew he would come  up to me and do the same thing.  And so I said, you know what, I'll get him back. 
[02:57:00]  I'll fight his, I'm going to beat him at his own game for some crazy reason.  I said, I'm going to fight this guy toe-to-toe and kick his butt.  And that didn't happen, you know.  Right, yeah.  Because he hit me so hard, man.  You had this reputation, didn't you?  And I think you didn't like it, where people felt like, oh, Sugar Ray's popular because  Cosell kind of took to you.  And then did you kind of resent having to prove that you were a tough guy from this?  You didn't grow up in some great neighborhood and great circumstances.  I wish I did, but no, I did not. 
[02:57:30]  You know, the fact that they felt that I was kind of network made because of my relationship  with Howard Cosell and the fact that I was on television, then I started doing commercials  and I was leading a life that was not conducive to what they felt would be a real fighter.  And they felt I didn't punch, I couldn't take a punch.  And I don't know, those things did bother me because I was sensitive towards that criticism.  And you're right, I mean, I fell prey to that. 
[02:58:00]  And when you were growing up, you grew up in, you saw a lot of violence growing up.  I mean, it was things I never would have guessed about you from seeing the image.  You know, it's like Sugar Ray Leonard, everybody loves him.  But, you know, you saw a lot of violence in the house growing up.  Yeah, I mean, I think that's a norm.  And we live in a dysfunctional family, and my family was.  And I'm sure there's a lot of other families that can relate to what I'm saying.  How about all?  How about all families?  Just look around the room.  You're in a room of disasters right now. 
[02:58:30]  This is a yard sale of disasters.  There's not one emotionally healthy person in here.  Nope.  But, you know, it was a thing that I dealt with, you know.  Because, again, I was, you know, a quiet, very introverted kid.  And I saw fights between my parents.  I saw violence on the streets.  I mean, there was violence all around me in the environment.  I didn't like screaming.  I didn't like the verbal confrontations. 
[02:59:00]  And I tried to avoid that.  And the only thing that gave me a safe haven or a sense of peace was boxing.  Boxing was my safe haven.  Boxing saved me and kept me away from all the other stuff.  Because I can control what took place in the ring.  I can control that.  Outside the ring, I was a lost soul.  It was almost like Mike Tyson when he was younger.  I mean, he got in a lot of trouble early.  But then boxing was what saved him.  Without question.  Without question. 
[02:59:30]  And you're right.  Just like Mike Tyson, boxing was my saver.  Didn't you see your mother stab your father?  I didn't see it, but I saw him with a knife in his back.  And it was traumatic.  I looked at him.  Wow, yeah.  What happened?  I remember from the book.  Well, I was a kid.  And they had arguments, like most parents and husbands and wives.  But to me, it was amplified. 
[03:00:00]  And I heard screaming.  I heard yelling.  And it always bothered me as a kid.  And when I saw that, it freaked me out.  It scared me.  But I suppressed it.  I kept it inside.  I never told anyone.  I didn't tell my brothers.  I didn't tell my sisters how much it bothered me to see my parents fighting.  To see fights on the streets.  I mean, all those things bothered me.  But then again, it's crazy.  It's like a paradox.  Because all of a sudden, I become a fighter.  Yeah. 
[03:00:30]  Boy, that beats the hell out of my father throwing the spaghetti against the wall.  Yeah.  Damn.  I thought that was a bad one.  Wow.  We all do adapt to it in our own ways.  And obviously, you would like to have grown up in a functional, nice family.  But it does make you the person you are.  So the end kind of justifies the means.  I dealt with it through just being kind of a funny guy in school.  And I guess being, well, you said you were kind of an introverted kid. 
[03:01:00]  I wonder if that has something to do with you being more physical then to deal with it through boxing than somebody like, you know, Jim or me or Opie just, you know, going through certain things and being a little more, hey, me, look at me.  Don't lump me into your pussy crowd.  Don't lump me into the sissy brigade.  Sorry.  Sorry.  There's two fighters talking over there.  Exactly.  A couple of men of similar ilk.  Jimmy knows how to hit the heavy bag.  You can address her.  I just wonder.  It's kind of an odd thing that an introverted person would pick boxing as something to deal with life. 
[03:01:30]  You know, I don't think that the guy next to you, Jim, right, that's asking a question, don't think he has his shit together.  The guy's in his 40s.  He has kiss posters in his bedroom.  42.  I look a lot younger than I'm here.  I've been too young.  You know, I mean, you might not want to say it, but I'll say it.  It's a good night.  But that's actually a good question about being introverted. 
[03:02:00]  And like they say, it's the quiet ones that.  Yeah, because it's such a, I mean, obviously a physical sport.  Right.  And to get into it.  And how did you get into it?  Was there a gym around?  You know what?  Just stop beating asses on the street?  My brother, Roger, would just kick my ass every, just because I'm just there.  He just, I mean, he was such a bully.  And the one day he told me, he said, come on, Ray, come down to the gym. 
[03:02:30]  They have boxing.  And I went down there.  I put the gloves on.  And all of a sudden there was a sense of, this is me.  Wow.  Because I felt that like baseball and football were too dangerous.  You know?  I just, I didn't, I never played any other sports because either they didn't pick me because I was such a bad athlete.  Or I just felt that it was dangerous.  And boxing was a sport that, I kind of found boxing, boxing found me.  And it's mano-a-mano. 
[03:03:00]  Because I, I always felt I didn't need anyone.  And again, going back to, I suppressed it.  I didn't tell anyone about my pain.  The same thing with boxing.  Boxing was for me.  I could do it myself.  I could figure this out.  And I did.  Because I, at 14, I was so disciplined.  I was so motivated.  I was so committed to that sport that I excelled within a year.  Because within a year, I kicked my brother's butt.  Big time.  I broke his nose a couple times. 
[03:03:30]  Nice.  What direction do you think, hypothetically, obviously, that you would have gone in if it wasn't for boxing?  Do you think you would have gotten into trouble or gone into some other?  It was inevitable.  It was inevitable.  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, a couple of my friends did, you know, did some things.  And I would have been one of the followers.  I would have been with the group.  Drugs.  I mean, drugs was always around.  And there was always things of, there was always things to get you in trouble. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, some negative.  There was always negativity around.  Yeah, yeah.  What happened to you the night, it was right after you won, I think, the Olympic you won in Montreal.  You said you almost ruined your life.  At a party.  A bunch of guys were in the bathroom.  Yeah.  And you walked in.  And what happened?  It was like a decision that somebody else almost made for you.  Well, you have to understand, when I came back from the Olympics, I got a gold medal on my neck, right?  And I'm looking to be like Bruce Jenner, be on the Wheaties box.  I get home and front page, fraternity suit, Sugar Ray Leonard, you know. 
[03:04:30]  And because back then, because I mean, my girlfriend who became my first wife, Juanita, we didn't have money.  So to gain, you know, some financial aid, the mother was not supposed to know the whereabouts of the father.  So we kind of lied to get food stamps and what have you.  So it was a big article came out.  And so no companies would let me endorse them. 
[03:05:00]  They had considered me for one of those cereal boxes.  And they said, well, no, because we're a family company.  And I felt like, man, God, Jesus Christ, man.  And I was so upset that one night I went out to my friend's house.  And in the back, actually in the bathroom, they were, you know, shooting up drugs, heroin.  And I said, do me.  And I did that.  And I recall vividly that that needle came like about a half inch from my vein. 
[03:05:30]  Wow.  And one guy said, we're not going to let you F your life up.  And they stopped.  I mean, just.  Wow.  So it wasn't you that stopped.  They were looking after you.  They stopped.  They looked, yeah.  And this was after the Olympics?  Yep.  Wow.  Is that an amazing fate, though?  Like somebody in that bathroom said something like you have a gold medal.  What are you doing?  You have something.  Yeah.  He said, you're not one of us.  He said, you have a chance to be somebody.  And that resonated with me, I mean, for so long. 
[03:06:00]  Even now, I think about that.  I get chills when I think about that.  How close it came to possibly going down the toilet.  Because my older brother, Roger, who got me in boxing, he became a heroin addict.  Oh, shit.  He boxed and was an addict.  And my sister, my little sister, Sharon, she was an addict, too.  Well, plus, your goal wasn't to become a professional fighter.  I mean, you didn't say, I'm going to, you wanted to just, you didn't want to just win the Olympics and then once that was done, just get out of boxing?  Just get out of boxing.  Because I've heard those horror stories of boxers who made a lot of money and they end up derelicts on the streets with nothing. 
[03:06:30]  I mean, it still happens today without question.  And I didn't want to be them.  Plus, my hands were, you know, my hands were small.  And, you want to feel it?  I would like.  I want to, I'm feeling Sugar Ray Leonard.  I don't want to feel it the way, like, you know, Hearns felt it.  But, I mean, it's nice to touch it and not have to worry about going to the hospital after.  Let's take punches.  My hands were fragile and they always were pain, always in pain. 
[03:07:00]  And I felt I was going to go to University of Maryland.  I wanted to go to University of Maryland and get a job, get a better job.  Jake LaMotta had small hands, too.  There's a scene in Raging Bull where he's got small hands and they're going to fight Joe Lewis and then his brother's to point out, you're a middleweight, idiot.  He's a heavyweight.  Jake wasn't that bright, obviously.  Did the money lure you back?  The money, no.  Did it lure you back in when you retired?  No.  You know, I was very fortunate to have a guy, my attorney, Mike Traynor, who orchestrated my career, kept me away from, you know, all the bad stuff. 
[03:07:30]  He's responsible for me being in my position financially.  You know, I'm sorry.  No, no, I'm just, I think back because a lot of times, you know, you don't smell the roses.  And for all these years, I never took time to just sit back and look at what I've accomplished because I was always trying to get the next thing, whether it's a fight or just girl or whatever. 
[03:08:00]  Now my life has changed because I've been five years sober.  You know, I walk into this meeting that changed my life.  And it was the toughest thing to ever do.  I mean, I would fight her three times in one night than to have walked into that room.  Thank God I did.  And when I first walked into that room, I remember I took two Vicodins to give me courage to have the courage to walk into that room and to say to people, I'm an alcoholic. 
[03:08:30]  You know, I left that room and I was exhausted.  I was scared.  And then the next day I went back, I took one.  And then the third day, I said, Ray, you're lying to yourself.  So I went, the third day, I took nothing.  And I experienced something, a fellowship of this program that has made me the man that I am now, five years later.  It's amazing.  So what was it that made you feel that you had to go into? 
[03:09:00]  You know, because my wife would always say, my wife, Bernadette, would say, you know, you're not present.  I never quite understood being present because I was there.  But I wasn't there, really there.  And I took my kids for granted.  I took my wife for granted.  And I just felt that, I looked in the mirror.  And I mirror, don't lie.  It tells you exactly who you are.  And I, you know, I cried, man.  I looked at my, I said, all this fame, all this fortune I have, it really means nothing. 
[03:09:30]  It does, if I'm not happy.  And I did soul searching.  And I surrendered.  I think that's the key word, surrender.  And say, you know, I'm an alcoholic.  And you know what?  I'm a better person.  I'm a better man this morning.  How much did the drugs and alcohol play a part?  Because, you know, I'm in the same boat you are.  How much did the drugs and alcohol play a part?  Because people, again, the image was so, the 7-Up commercials, nobody had any idea. 
[03:10:00]  But you were drinking and doing drugs to a pretty good part of your public life.  The drugs and alcohol escalated when I was retired.  That didn't occur in the early part of my career.  It started happening when I retired in 1982.  That's when it all began.  Because then cocaine was like a cool thing, you know?  It was a cool thing.  And pretty much, not legal, but accepted in a certain world. 
[03:10:30]  And I did it.  And I had friends, I thought were friends, and we just did it.  And the more I did it, the less I thought of myself.  Because I had low self-esteem.  Even as champion, I had low self-esteem.  Oh, Coke will cure that for a couple of minutes.  Yeah.  Exactly.  For a few minutes.  For a few minutes.  Until you try to have sex on it, then there's a low self-esteem again.  This is amazing, by the way. 
[03:11:00]  This is just, I'm so happy you're opening up, sugar.  The book is so...  Absolutely, it's the big fight.  Brutally honest.  And it really covers a lot of, obviously, pain.  What was the hardest thing for you to talk about?  Because you really got in-depth about a lot of things that nobody had any idea about.  What was the hardest thing for you to open up about?  Well, when I was abused by someone that I really trusted, or twice it happened.  And I didn't say the name, and someone, I read someone that someone said, 
[03:11:30]  well, how come you don't reveal the name?  These two guys are dead.  And I don't want to hurt their family.  And they're gone.  And they won't hurt anyone else.  For me to come up and come out and say this has relieved me of so much pain and...  Probably anger. 
[03:12:00]  Anger, anger.  Because it's a paradox, man.  Here it is.  I'm a fighter.  And yet, I ran.  I could have kicked their ass.  I could have beat...  I mean, I could kill those guys.  But I didn't.  Why didn't you?  One guy gave me money, and I needed money.  And you're talking about sexual abuse.  It's not a physical thing.  At what age was this?  I was like 15, 16.  Just before you made it.  Yeah, the Olympics.  And I didn't tell my mom, my mother or father. 
[03:12:30]  I didn't tell my friends.  I told my first wife, Juanita.  And when I told her, I told her naturally, I was drinking.  Because it breaks...  You know, when I drink, it breaks down that holding back.  And she looked at me.  And she responded like, it doesn't happen.  So, you know...  Hmm.  She didn't believe it.  What could she say to me?  Right, right.  What could she say to me that could solve me or fix me?  Then I told my second wife, Bernadette. 
[03:13:00]  This is many years later.  And again, I was drinking when I told her that.  Because I didn't have the courage to tell her when I was sober.  And she looked at me.  And somehow, we kind of let it go by.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  We just let it go by.  Because what do you say?  What can you say to me?  That's going to make me feel better.  Do you think it was that when something like that comes out,  obviously, it gives great shame to the person.  It's like you carry a sense of shame with you because that's happened.  It is shame.  It is shame. 
[03:13:30]  And it's like, what do you...  People don't know how to handle it.  When you're expressing shame to people, they don't know how to take it away.  I don't know the answer.  I just don't know.  You know?  I just feel better that...  I can't believe I'm sitting here in a station, radio station, and talking about this stuff.  But I feel good that I'm talking about this stuff.  I feel more of a person getting...  I feel lighter, by the way.  Are you still dealing with it?  Or have you found a way to not bury it, but to have dealt with it and made peace with it? 
[03:14:00]  If I said no, I would be lying.  I mean, does it bother me as much as it bothered me before I made this revelation?  No, not at all.  In fact, you know, I am...  It may sound crazy, but I'm proud that I'm standing...  I'm being transparent.  You know?  Does that make sense?  I don't know if that makes sense or what, but I feel good that I'm saying this.  Because it's taken so much from me. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  An honesty gives you a certain freedom because no one can hold anything over you or against you.  Some secret that you never want to get out.  If you don't have any secrets, nobody can really screw with you.  So when you do let things out, and we've exposed so much about our own lives on this show,  it is kind of freeing because no one can touch you.  No one can really touch you.  I can't touch myself.  I beat myself up so many times, so many times, for 30 years, man. 
[03:15:00]  I beat myself up.  Were you mad that you didn't react differently?  Yeah, I'm saying...  Well, you've got to have those regrets.  A lot of times when what happens to somebody like something like that happens, you feel like it's your fault.  Yes, well...  In fact, I didn't retaliate.  I didn't retaliate.  I didn't defend myself.  Because I could.  I couldn't.  I just...  I questioned.  I kept questioning what the hell was wrong with me.  Did you feel like they had power over you? 
[03:15:30]  Not power.  I mean, physically, obviously, you could beat the shit out of them, but was there some kind of weird mental power you felt they had over you?  One had Uncle Sam dollars because I needed...  I mean, this is before the Olympics, so I had no money.  I had no job.  I had a kid.  I had little Ray.  I had no job.  I needed to feed my son.  And the other one was like a matter of trust.  You know, I want the Olympics.  I mean, the Olympics, to me, was my ultimate.  And again, I was, you know, 15, 16, whatever the case may be. 
[03:16:00]  I trained for the Olympics, and that was my goal.  It sounds like it was a guy that was helping you train for the Olympics then, if I'm reading between the lines here.  Yes, yes.  So, if you expose him, that could take away your dream.  That's confusing to a young man.  You know...  Right?  Yeah, I mean...  Am I onto something there?  Hmm.  I don't know what you want to say, but...  I don't know what I'm saying.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, okay.  But no, it's like the guy, it's a weird guy. 
[03:16:30]  You trust somebody.  Mm-hmm.  They try to sexualize you.  And it's like, by exposing them, it's almost like it's safer sometimes just to shut it down and not...  Just to kind of tuck it away and not deal with it.  And not deal with it.  Because if this is somebody helping you achieve the Olympic dream, or it's like, you know, there's an ugly reality there.  Like, this could all be taken away.  You said something.  Shut it down.  I shut it down.  Yes.  I shut it down for 30 years, and, you know, thank God, I just opened it back up.  Yeah, Duran and Hagler and Hearn had to pay the price. 
[03:17:00]  You know how annoying they are?  You didn't talk about this 30 years ago.  Jesus.  He said, speaking of fighters, we were discussing this before you got here.  It's tough, obviously, but top five fighters of all time.  Do you have a list?  The top five fighters of all time.  Well, for what he represented and what he meant to me and what he did accomplish, Ollie.  Yeah.  Sugar Ray Robinson.  We said you'd say that. 
[03:17:30]  Joe Lewis.  That's three we said.  Yeah, look at this.  You could put yourself on there, sir.  No.  Would you put yourself on the list?  A lot of people would put you on the list.  A lot of people would put you on the top five.  I wouldn't.  I mean, no, I wouldn't.  I'd let people be the judge of that.  Five, what?  Those three?  Those three?  Would you put Julio Cesar Chavez on the list because he was 80-0 at one point, or Holmes?  Chavez was an amazing fighter, a great fighter.  But that list there speaks for itself to me. 
[03:18:00]  It's like Rocky Marciano, you know?  Yeah, that does kind of transcend.  Everyone else is on a different number one, two, three, four, and five list.  Those are like the legends.  Yeah, but it goes beyond legendary.  It goes, it's what they represented.  It's what people felt about them.  How about Foreman?  Would you put him on that list just because of the way he destroyed Norton, and he destroyed Frazier? 
[03:18:30]  No, and George is an anomaly.  And I'd rather have George's grill, but...  Yeah, that damn moneymaker.  Who knew?  Who knew, yeah.  It's like, I'll make a grill the size of my fist.  Yeah.  And, God, that guy had huge hands.  You sure that poor Leon Spinks is putting out hats?  It's like, nobody wants a hat, Leon.  They need grills.  George was responsible for me coming back a couple times.  I'd say, well, George can do it.  Yeah, yeah.  How old was he when he became...  He was 40-something.  Late 40s, was it when he beat...  Amazing.  Did he beat Holyfield or the... 
[03:19:00]  No, when he first came back, he was...  42, 43?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Early 40s.  But then...  That was old back then.  That was very old.  Well, no.  They called me over 30 when I fought Hagelin.  That's what I'm saying.  So, when a guy comes back in 42, that was considered ancient for a while.  He was here last week, Bernard.  We had Bernard last week.  Amazing.  We almost got into some shit, he and I.  Yeah?  No.  No.  You guys the same weight, right?  You like the same weight?  I had Bernard stare me down just to see what it felt like to have a real fighter stare.  Really unpleasant. 
[03:19:30]  That psych game you guys play with each other, where you're looking at each other, that is  really uncomfortable.  But, you know, it's uncanny.  I look at you, and you have the same physique as Hopkins.  As an oyster?  No, he means Anthony Hopkins, the actor.  Where do you put Mike Tyson on that list?  Mike's up there, too, without question.  Mike Tyson.  He messed it up, though.  But, you know, he's bounced back.  And the legacy is something that people will have to cement. 
[03:20:00]  They will be the ones to make the judge of that.  But Mike Tyson, I loved watching him for so many years.  I mean, you knew he was going to knock the guy out, but you didn't know in what fashion.  Yeah.  Like, will the guy get back up, or will he need to be assisted into the corner?  Or will he be knocked out of the ring?  Regardless of who he was fighting, because, you know, guys were saying he wasn't fighting  the best fighters at some point. 
[03:20:30]  And his record and the end of his career, he brought people to boxing again.  He really did make it where, when he was on pay-per-view, you were watching, you went  to your friend's house, you know, you got the beers out, you got the chips, and you were  watching a fight.  People watch, I mean, millions of people watch Mike Tyson.  Mike Tyson was such a, just an attraction. 
[03:21:00]  Yes.  You know, he was, he was a star in boxing.  And, you know, those moments are pretty much gone.  Yeah, yeah.  For now.  Boxing in general's kind of gone.  It's a cyclical thing, maybe.  It's not like it was when we were growing up.  Who's the ones that are, that people really care about?  I mean, you got Mayweather, Pacquiao, and I mean, you know, Hopkins is older.  Hopkins is older, obviously.  But they're off.  You think it'll make a comeback?  It will.  It's a resilient sport.  It'll come back.  But what's happened, the UFC, or Mixed Boxer Arch. 
[03:21:30]  Which we love, by the way, just so you know.  Because they have taken the page from boxing.  In other words, they create personalities, these fights that are so highly anticipated.  Yeah.  And boxing used to be that way.  You know, there was a fight every few weeks or a few months, a fight that was highly anticipated.  But we don't have that as much now.  The money, it seems like the money in boxing is obviously so much higher than it is UFC. 
[03:22:00]  And it was so hard to get the two big combatants together.  Whereas in UFC, they're all making relatively in the same neighborhood as each other.  None of them are making $12 million paydays.  Like, you know.  So maybe that's why.  It was just harder to get these guys into the ring.  Remember, it was so complicated.  And then it would finally be announced that they got them together.  And you'd just go nuts waiting for the fight.  Tyson Holyfield.  We want a Tyson Holyfield.  Forever, right?  He went to jail, but I mean, when that fight happened, it was a bit of an anticlimax, you  know?  We've had Don King in here.  A couple of times. 
[03:22:30]  Don, what a character.  What a...  I don't even know what to think of a guy.  How much different would your life have been had you signed...  Because there was a scene where Ray's talking about in the book where he almost...  He's out to dinner with Don King and your brother, right, went to the bathroom?  That was my...  Jenks Morton.  Okay, Jenks went to the bathroom.  And this is...  Don King is no dummy.  He pulls out a contract while his...  Wow.  His guy's in the bathroom.  He's like, if you want to sign it.  Well, you know...  We've had that happen.  I would have had longer hair.  I think I would have had longer hair.  Oh, yeah.  Do you think your career would have gone a lot differently and financially you'd be in  a lot more desperate shape had you signed that deal? 
[03:23:00]  I would not have been as successful.  I think that being my own man, my own boss, was truly a blessing.  And Mike Treanor, again, has given me that freedom.  You know?  It's a great thing.  I mean, I was able to retire my parents and take care of my brothers and my friends.  That's great, yeah.  And I bought them all, you know, cars.  They were all Pintos. 
[03:23:30]  So in the same color.  But, you know...  You've got a deal.  I've got a hell of a deal.  The brother's doing okay now?  My brother's doing great.  They're doing all right?  They're doing great.  Did your older brother ever make it in boxing at all on any sort of level?  My brother, Roger, was number two in the world.  See, no idea.  And never really trained because he was a part-time boxer and part-time playboy.  And, you know, he never gave it 100%.  And now, you know, he feels that he kind of missed this opportunity to be a world champion. 
[03:24:00]  And with the women, again, you're very honest about that, about the philandering and the cheating.  And, again, I love to hear a guy talking about that because it's like so many people, we act, whenever we see a public figure fall, we all act like we can't understand how it happens.  But it's like, how does anybody with that opportunity say no?  It's really difficult when you're all of a sudden, all the hottest women in the world are throwing themselves at you.  Listen, I was a wallflower.  I didn't, I mean, when I was in school, the girls never came my way. 
[03:24:30]  You know, I had a gap in my teeth and I had a bad afro and, you know, I had no clothes.  And, you know, they didn't give me a time of day.  So when I became...  When you phrase it like that, I almost don't blame them.  That's not what I'm saying.  Really?  Now we understand.  I had acme, I had major acme.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, keep going.  Making us feel better about ourselves.  A prize. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  You were a mess.  Yeah, I was a mess.  Did you ever do it like right before a fight?  Do what?  Yeah, what's wrong?  You fool around with the chicks before the whole thing, not having sex.  What did Ali ask you about that?  He asked me, he said, he said, do you...  Do you like...  Can I say that?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  You can say pussy?  Oh, yeah.  We prefer you do.  Yeah.  This is satellite radio, uncensored.  It's amazing.  Wow.  He asked me that.  And I'm sitting with my idol, Muhammad Ali, and of all the things to ask a 19-year-old kid, 
[03:25:30]  Oh, jeez.  Do you like pussy?  I said, sometimes.  He said, how long do you wait before...  He said, when do you stop having pussy before a fight?  I said, about three days.  He said, you're a bad nigga.  Muhammad Ali has meant and continues to mean so much to me because I watched him because I idolized him. 
[03:26:00]  And I emulated him.  I remember when I first started boxing, I was boxing like Joe Frazier.  And I was knocking guys out.  And I saw Ali fight Joe Frazier the first fight.  And I looked at Ali's face.  I looked at Joe's face.  I said, you know what?  I saw him moving like Ali.  Smart.  And didn't Ali even win the first fight?  No, he lost the first fight.  I'm sorry, he lost.  Then he won the next two.  I mean, I love Joe Frazier because James Morton, my trainer, took me to meet Joe in his training camp. 
[03:26:30]  And I mean, to be a fighter like Joe or Ali or myself, it takes, again, a commitment.  You really, really have to be committed to be a fighter, to be a great fighter committed.  And what happens, we come back, 99.9% of the time we come back for financial reasons.  But even if you come back just for the glory, as you get older, those punches hurt because you become civilized. 
[03:27:00]  Right.  You enjoy the fruits of labor.  You enjoy the atmosphere.  You fly on private planes.  You're with, you know, the beautiful women.  And you do all these things that are not conducive to fighting, to boxing.  Yeah, I guess it's harder to step out of the first class lounge and get punched in the face.  Than it is when you're coming up.  No, it's true.  It's so true. 
[03:27:30]  Because being a fighter, you don't play boxing.  You don't play boxing.  Boxing demands your full attention.  And if you get in that ring without being really focused, you get hurt.  Well, I love your, I'm sorry, I love your relationship with Duran that you talk about.  And there was one part where you actually, Duran lost to Hagler and then, or did he beat Hagler and he leaned in when you were and told you you should fight him?  I was working with HBO and I recall Duran was fighting Hagler and it was a pretty close fight. 
[03:28:00]  And at the end of the fight, Duran walks over to me and leans through the ropes and said, Ray, you box him, you beat him.  Because he, Duran was all boxing Hagler.  He just kind of ran out of gas.  And I thought about that.  I thought about that.  And then, you know, after the fight I went for a few drinks and then I called my attorney.  I said, Mike, you know, he said, don't even say that.  Don't even go there. 
[03:28:30]  He said, don't even go there.  And so it was a process because I watched Hagler all the time from ringside.  And I observed him and I broke him down.  I analyzed him.  And I understood his pet peeves, what bothered him, what really teed him off.  And I worked on those things.  Same way you beat, he psyched Hagler out by getting to the center of the ring before he did to kind of claim it.  And then Duran in the No Moss fight, you just humiliated him. 
[03:29:00]  You humiliated him, you fucked with his macho and he couldn't deal with it.  Well, he, Duran, well, I mean, he, he was so frustrated in our second fight  because it was nowhere near what the first fight was.  The first fight was just total physical.  The second fight was more artistic.  I boxed him, used my legs, used my hand speed.  And I did the bolo part.  I did things that you don't normally do.  And he, I think he just fell prey to a short circuit. 
[03:29:30]  But, yeah, you can't be like, you can't be made to look very silly in the ring like that.  And if, like, I loved the way you would showboat like that.  That was very Ali.  Yes.  And that, it brought another realm of entertainment to boxing without, without making it like you weren't taking it seriously.  Oh, I wasn't taking it seriously.  And Ali, Ali was a pro at doing that.  So was Sugar, though. 
[03:30:00]  He was a natural at that, too, man.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  It wasn't forced whatsoever.  Amazing, yeah.  When you would wind up that arm and then just smash him with the other hand.  With the ball and the punch.  Oh, fantastic, yeah.  Yeah, they say Ray has to leave.  He's got a busy day.  Let me plug the signing.  Amazing book.  It's honestly, of all the sports biographies I've read, this is by far the most introspective.  It's the most honest.  And it's a great book.  I blew through this in three days.  And I mean, and I read every word of it.  It was an amazing book. 
[03:30:30]  And, you know, if you're going to write about your life, this is what you should do.  And if you want to see Sugar Ray today, he's signing Barnes & Noble on Fifth Avenue.  That's the big Barnes & Noble.  I believe it's in Union Square, is it, or no?  Is that the Union Square one, or no?  I'm not sure, Jimmy.  It's on Fifth Avenue.  If you see a giant line, you'll know you have it.  Get there early.  There's not going to be ten people to see Ray Leonard.  And then tomorrow, in New Jersey, a great independent bookstore called Bookends in Ridgewood, which  there's always a lot of indoor room to stand for that one. 
[03:31:00]  45th, possibly?  Barnes & Noble?  Oh, it might be.  That's what Travis is telling me.  Oh, Travis is saying 45th?  All right.  Well, Travis is an idiot, but he's probably right about that.  He really is an absolute fool.  Knows nothing.  And Sugar Ray Leonard, I mean, fantastic, man.
