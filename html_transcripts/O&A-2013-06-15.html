The show also promoted the Opie and Anthony "F.U. Line" and the Joe Rogan Experience.

The show continued with Robert Zimmerman further discussing the George Zimmerman trial, focusing on the media's misrepresentation of facts and the pressure on the jury. He highlighted the media's initial portrayal of his brother as white, ignoring their Hispanic heritage.  Anthony Cumia then recounted a raucous party he hosted, detailing the presence of two "hot" interns, Steve Cook, Roland, and DJ Danny Falcone, along with Vine videos of the event, a noise complaint from the neighbors, and police intervention.

A caller expressed great enthusiasm for the new album.  The conversation covered the evolution of music recording technology.

The final segment featured Bonnie McFarlane, recounting a negative experience at a comedy club, focusing on a conflict with the club's booker, Dustin.  She described a show where she went over her allotted time after a very successful act, leading to Dustin's angry reaction, both backstage and later via harsh text messages and an email canceling her future gigs. The audience was described as racially diverse, mainly Hispanic and Black. McFarlane discussed Dustin's aggressive behavior, her attempts at apology, and speculated on his motives. Rich Vos, her husband, participated in the conversation.  The conversation touched on the challenges of stand-up comedy and the industry's abrasive nature.  The segment concluded with promotion of various SiriusXM shows and sponsors.

Counting down the very best moments that happened this week on Opie and Anthony.  I'm Sam Roberts.  I'm on ONA every day, so I would think by now you know me. 
[00:07:00]  I'm also the host of After Opie and Anthony Live.  This week.  This all happened this week.  Seth Rogen was in studio.  Ozzy Osbourne was in studio.  Robert Zimmerman, George Zimmerman's brother, you know, from the Trayvon case, he was in studio.  Scott Thorson, the real-life Liberace boyfriend from the movie, was in studio.  Farrah Abrams was in studio.  For those that don't know who Farrah Abrams is, by the way, we'll get to all those people here on the countdown. 
[00:07:30]  Farrah Abrams is where we're going to start, though.  She was the teen mom who put out a sex tape.  She says that the sex tape was meant to be private.  I find that a little hard to believe, but maybe she'll be able to convince you.  Farrah Abrams on the worst of the week countdown.  Let's get Farrah in here.  Yes, Farrah Abraham.  Farrah Abraham, teen mom.  Teen mom with a porno.  Hi!  Hi, Farrah. 
[00:08:00]  Take a seat right there.  Doing good.  Ooh, it's actually comfy and warm in here.  Yeah, yeah.  But some people come in and say it smells like a men's locker room, though.  Okay, whatever.  It's kind of a guy vibe thing going on in here.  Look at you.  You're all like Hollywood.  You look like, you know.  You're polished.  You look like a celebrity.  That's pretty good.  Nice, I guess.  Yeah, it is.  It's a compliment.  Thanks.  Yeah, yeah.  So what are they making the rounds?  Were you just doing Howie?  Yeah, I just did Howard Stern, and I had a great interview. 
[00:08:30]  He's really nice.  Yeah, it was nice.  It wasn't like he was, did he ask anything embarrassing?  I think he was just too worried about bowel movements, but other than that, it was okay.  Oh, he must have been, okay, all right.  Well, obviously, your video, there's some backdoor action, I guess.  Yeah.  Was he just?  Yeah.  I mean, everyone keeps making it a big deal.  I'm like, what's the issue?  People have sex.  People have anal sex.  I know.  The thing is, like, for guys, it's kind of that, like, wow, you know? 
[00:09:00]  I think anal has replaced the blowjob as, like, the big thing to get if you're a guy.  Like, years ago, it was really ahead, I think.  I think it was more like, like, wow, I can't believe I'm getting a blowjob.  Anal was out of the fucking question.  Really?  Yeah.  I feel sorry for those couples, then.  I don't know.  It was like, I'm talking mega years ago.  In the days before girls shaved down.  That's fucking, yeah.  I don't know.  Let me tell you a little story.  The dark ages.  There was a, yeah, there was a dark, we called these the dark times. 
[00:09:30]  The dark ages.  It was, yeah, yeah, they never shaved down back then.  You used to have to do this weird thing like you were pulling apart, like, hedges to peek through at your neighbor.  Okay, it's a little weird, yeah.  Why is it weird?  I mean, because I'm not about that.  Yeah, yeah.  So.  No, no, I know.  I just want to get the.  I mean, some women probably still do that.  Some people probably still don't get blowjobs.  I don't know.  Yeah, probably.  You're right on both counts.  Some women don't shave and don't give head.  Yeah, yeah, Jimmy. 
[00:10:00]  Those women should die alone.  I think they do.  And anal's no big deal, because I think you did it when you were 15 anyway, right?  Yeah.  Really?  She did anal at 15.  Jesus.  Wow.  You've got to read the bio.  Yeah, yeah, that is a good one.  I usually don't read the bio, but.  Yeah, this one was very interesting.  Wow.  How did you come to this place where you were doing a movie?  Because it's amazing how many people saw your movie.  And it's hard to, I think.  That is pretty amazing.  Yeah.  It's hard to make an impression in adult films now, because there's so many and it's all over it. 
[00:10:30]  It's hard just to come in and all of a sudden just stand out.  You know what?  It's very weird, but in my life, I have gotten a lot of attention.  I don't know why.  Like, my first book, New York Times bestseller.  My first shows were top rated.  I don't know why that is.  I didn't know you wrote a book.  What was the book?  My Teenage Dream Ended.  Okay.  What happened?  Like, what was your turn 20?  It was a memoir about my teen years.  And it was the struggles, like depression, the loss of my boyfriend, those type of things  that I went through. 
[00:11:00]  And so now I'm just moving on from that.  You know, I'm progressing to adulthood.  And, you know, that's some of what my new show that's going to be coming out is about.  And I'm, you know, blessed.  I get to work with spin boy films on that.  And, you know, I'm just a mother and an adult.  And I think lots of people don't understand that.  And I think that's why things are a shock.  Like, there's having sex.  Well, I don't know how that's a shock because I've had a daughter.  And, you know, I'm still trying to date.  I'm still trying to be a normal 20-something-year-old that has sex. 
[00:11:30]  So I think it's just more of a shocker.  And I don't understand why, though.  People are pretty fascinated with the whole sexual thing, especially if you'd been in  the public eye before.  Like, okay, we knew you from, you know, being a teen mom and things like that.  But we didn't know that.  And then all of a sudden, like, when a celebrity kind of has a sex tape, it gets a lot of attention.  It gets a lot of attention.  And you were very good in it.  I don't get sex much, so. 
[00:12:00]  When I get it, let's take advantage.  Yeah.  Are you in a relationship?  Are you dating?  No, I'm single.  And I'll probably be single for a while.  Really?  Yep.  By choice.  Like, like, that's just a silly question by choice.  No, force her into it.  Yeah, no, no guys are asking around, Angie.  I mean, I get asked out and I get lots of, like, flattering things and attention.  But I just feel like I can't just trust anybody.  I mean, a guy can act so nice and trustworthy at first. 
[00:12:30]  And that's, you know, what I've been kind of fucked over in the past with.  And so that's why I just don't even go there right now because I really don't need any more sexual attention or any other guy taking advantage of just being in my life or being intimate with me.  Yeah.  How did this whole thing, this whole road for you start?  Like, where you, like, where you.  I was like every other teenager.  I was a cheerleader.  I was very popular growing up.  And then I ended up getting pregnant.  I was on birth control. 
[00:13:00]  I was doing modeling and acting at the time.  I told one of my coaches who were helping me.  So she was, you know, just at MTV's casting, you know, for some show.  They need pregnant teens.  I did a video.  I sent it in.  I got the call back.  And it's, you know, like four years later.  And here I am.  Wow.  Would you have.  And I know the the the your boyfriend was was killed.  Yeah.  And if when you went into like you do know you did the film now, do you think that that's where you kind of thinking of doing that anyway?  Or was that one of those things that just. 
[00:13:30]  I mean, I think all of us.  Maybe I shouldn't say that.  But I know in my life and my friends lives and where I am in life, I think all of us are like either we've already done a video or we're going to think about doing a video or we're going to get those.  I think it's just, you know, embracing your young self for when you're older and you can look back on that.  And so that's kind of where I was in my life.  I mean, I really just feel like I'm old enough.  I know that, you know, I feel great and I'm happy where I am in life. 
[00:14:00]  And I just, you know, I wanted to do that right now.  Did they do they approach you about it and say, look, this is a good deal.  Or did you say I want to do it and put the feelers up?  Who approached me?  Yeah.  How my sex thing came about.  I did that with like a person I was talking to at the time.  And some, you know, some things went negative in our relationship and he kind of wanted to become popular off of doing it.  And so I dealt with it legally because otherwise I would have been fucked over and everyone would have seen me naked for free. 
[00:14:30]  So, I mean, that's kind of how it came about.  And people reached out to my lawyer and I went from there.  Oh, so that wasn't a movie that you did that you were like contracted to do.  I was never contracted to do one.  I didn't realize that.  Okay.  So that's just one that you're like, you're not releasing this and just taking all this money.  There's only one video of me ever having sex.  Right.  So I'm saying that one, it wasn't something like that you discussed before.  You thought that was going to remain private.  It definitely should have remained private. 
[00:15:00]  And it's fine that it's out now.  Honestly, everyone has sex and I really don't care.  So you see me naked, you have sex and probably more sex than I do.  So whatever.  It was very well done for something that should have just been like, you know, between two people.  Everyone says this, but I should say like, thanks for the compliment.  I guess it had amazing lighting.  It was like everything.  Yeah.  Very good lighting and everything.  It was framed.  Well, you could like see the action.  Like also James's background, like he has like done films before, obviously, and I have 
[00:15:30]  done TV work.  And I think when your brains are already wired to do things properly, second nature to just  things are just beautiful.  Things turn out better.  And I think, you know, I didn't want to want to tape that look like shit anyways to keep  still.  So yeah, there's no plans of doing any more.  No, I'm sure you've had.  I mean, I don't think lots of weird things have occurred since then, but no, I, even if 
[00:16:00]  I were married, I don't think it would be the right thing to ever do another video.  Yeah.  I just don't think I could trust.  What kind of weird offers?  Like different companies wanting to like put me in the position of being like a porn star.  Right.  Yeah.  I think that's not even in my vocabulary.  Like, I don't even want to be about that.  Are you annoyed that he did this or are you like happy?  I was annoyed.  You know what?  It's been like months now.  I'm really over it and I'm, you know, just happy. 
[00:16:30]  I covered my own ass.  So.  Yeah.  That's smart.  I mean, so to speak.  So to speak.  So to speak.  That's right.  Of course.  But what do you got working on now?  What's the new show?  Um, so it's, I think we're working with the title of Finding Farrah and I think it's just,  you know, coming into womanhood, you know, seeing what the adult life of Farrah is rather  than the teen life that others are used to. 
[00:17:00]  So, and like I said, I'm working with Spin Boy Films and they're based here out of New  York.  What'll it show you doing?  Oh, it'll show me doing, um, restaurant stuff, you know, relationships with my parents.  Um, also where my daughter is.  She's four right now.  And there's a lot of things of like, you know, it's a time for a cell phone.  Like, what are these things?  Like, there's a lot of like trial and error, but also like, I guess finding, finding where  I fit in really.  Did you have to like sit your parents down and go, Hey, it's like this, uh, you're going 
[00:17:30]  to be hearing about the tape.  I never, Oh, about the video.  Um, no.  I mean, do you go tell your parents that you're going to go have sex with your girlfriend?  My parents, no, because they actually, they encourage us to fuck because I'm a nicer person  when I fuck.  No, no, but you got to admit it's a little different that it got out there.  So yeah, when it came about and it was in the public, my mother just texted me and was  like, you need to handle this.  Cause somebody is like trying to get attention. 
[00:18:00]  And so that's what I did.  Yeah.  So, and then it turned into some other things cause of Dr. Phil and just mind manipulation  with my parents.  And you know, I just have boundaries and I love my parents no matter what, but yeah, they  are where they are and I am where I am.  What do you mean to turn into something cause of Dr. Phil negativity, more negativity than  what was needed.  I think if you're going to talk about sex and if you're going to try to be there for  your daughter or somebody else who's dealing with the public situation, it's better that 
[00:18:30]  you come together and talk and have resolution and grow from it rather than creating more  fights and more tension.  And I think Dr. Phil does a great job at that.  And I want to be proud.  Dr. Phil.  Dr. Phil is a fucking piece of shit.  He really is.  Many say he's thrown himself into more situations like a tornado.  Well, cause he's just getting it.  Cause he wants ratings.  Yeah.  He's just trying to get his ratings.  It's good business for him.  You don't give a fuck about these people. 
[00:19:00]  But you know, it's fine if you want to get ratings and do things, but he does this under  the guise of helping people.  Oh, sure.  Fuck off.  And that's, I don't have respect for people like that.  Yeah.  Now I, again, I'm pop culture, very ignorant.  When you were on Dr. Phil, your parents were, or both of you guys?  Um, my parents were with myself and Dr. Phil was acting like he was helping, but really  he just likes to make things worse.  Stir it up.  He'll, he'll say things and put words in people's mouths as they're up there and make conflict.  He wants conflict.  And that's fine.  Whatever.  He needs to, you too. 
[00:19:30]  Did you, did you realize he was doing that when he was doing it or is he?  Oh, I realized I quit talking to him.  Oh yeah.  I'm like, why did I even come here if you gave me another impression?  It was really f***ed up.  Oof.  Yeah.  Oh, that's fine.  Cause it's like, you know, everyone's done something when we've filmed something with  a person.  Is that what it was about?  He was giving you a s*** about that?  It was like, well.  Well, yeah, but he was like saying you shouldn't sell it and you should, I'm hell, it's going  to get out there anyways.  It's going to get out anyway.  Exactly.  Am I going to give somebody a free show or am I going to make sure I take care of it legally 
[00:20:00]  and get paid for it?  Right.  I mean, I think he's just an ignorant individual.  What's wrong with you selling it?  Like, what is he doing?  That's so important.  It's like.  He has his own issues from what I've heard from other radio shows.  And I don't even look into people's personal lives.  I like to just show up, meet them and see what they're about.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He definitely gave me a bad impression, but then every other radio show after that just  tore his ass and he went because of his personal life, his son, you know, dating Playboy stars  and like all this other s*** I didn't know about.  So I really feel that I'm in the clear with that. 
[00:20:30]  He's a douche.  I think people kind of really feel Dr. Phil's a douche.  There's just something about him that's truly hateable.  Yeah.  I mean, I think he's just a hateful person.  Why would you cause horrible things in other people's lives?  Yeah.  Well.  It makes good TV.  It makes good TV for him.  But to make believe he's actually helping people, that's ridiculous.  Yeah, yeah.  Just stop with it.  And he's not even a real doctor.  No, I know.  No.  But isn't that what it is?  We've been on his case for many years.  Trust me.  I'm Dr. Anthony.  He's very hateable.  Didn't he call myself Dr. Anthony.  Didn't he have to say with Britney Spears, like, well, I just counsel her. 
[00:21:00]  Like, he had to come out and go, like, I'm not a real doctor.  Oh, yeah.  I'm just counseling her or family counsel.  Oh, the guy's a twat.  I'm so happy everybody hates him now.  It is ridiculous.  Yeah.  No one really likes him.  So are you happy with the way the film came back?  We only saw a little bit of it.  I mean, it's fantastic.  I don't know what Vivid has.  I just have my thing at home that I watch.  But Howard was, like, telling me he was seeing different things that I've never heard before.  So I'm guessing there's a couple different cuts.  I don't know. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, yeah.  So whatever you see, you see, okay?  It's a very well-rounded movie.  There's a lot of, you know, different types of sexual activity.  There's a lot of action.  There's a nice storyline going on.  Yeah, yeah.  I like your little playful banter.  It's pretty good.  You know, a lot of playful banter.  Could have used a car chase, but, you know, it's okay.  Yeah, it was very sexy.  So we could watch the whole thing.  But it was very, it was very, it was quite good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Thanks for the compliment.  You're very welcome.  There you go. 
[00:22:00]  See, now you're figuring it out.  Thank you.  Thanks for the compliment.  And your show, you can get this on vivid.com.  So go there and get this.  Because this has got so many hits in such a short period of time.  There's just, I think the fact that you probably didn't contract to have it done, people like.  People like kind of looking in on people's private lives.  We like, I'm not saying it's right, but we, people are nosy.  And we like seeing shit we're not supposed to see.  Oh, we're all a bunch of busy bodies.  But if you had come out and said, hey, I'm signing up to do an adult film in two weeks,  it would have gotten hits, but probably not as many. 
[00:22:30]  But the fact that you had to fight to get it, people think like, oh, we're seeing something  we're not supposed to see.  So you can go and check it out.  It's what we've seen.  It's fucking sexy.  Backdoor.  Teen mom.  Yeah.  I wanted to stand and applaud when you walked in, but I figured that might be too much.  It's vivid.com.  And you can follow Farrah on F1.  It's the number one.  Abraham.  So just think of.  On Twitter.  Yeah.  And then you'll see all the appearances.  I'm going to be in New Jersey this week at Passions and at 46 Lounge.  And then I'm going to head out to Vegas at Sapphire for a pool party. 
[00:23:00]  Nice.  It's nice to be getting paid just to kind of hang out.  Yeah.  I enjoy meeting people.  I'm 22.  I'm single.  I like to go see what's out there.  Wait, one other thing.  The bikini from the scene was put on eBay and reached $14,700 before being pulled off the  site.  I don't know.  I'm not in charge of the bikini.  Oh, man.  Why would they pull it off the site?  It's a bikini.  $15,000.  Somebody was willing to pay for the bikini from the scene.  Because I heard it wasn't washed. 
[00:23:30]  Now the website Pornhub has it.  Oh, it wasn't washed?  Okay.  Oh, my God.  People are fucking freaks.  It's not even washed.  Yeah.  That is kind of rough.  How gross is it that we all understand the offer now?  Like, all right.  I completely get it.  I completely get it.  Oh, now it makes sense.  It's all right.  I got it.  You spent $15,000 on that phone?  Wow.  I guess a piece of pop culture or something.  Whatever.  It's very sexy.  I'll launder it the second I get it.  Yeah.  Yes.  Thanks so much for coming in.  Thank you for having me, guys.  Very, very beautiful and very lovely.  Very sexy.  Yes.  Yes. 
[00:24:00]  See you again.  The Worst of the Week Countdown.  On the Opie and Anthony channel.  The Worst of the Week Countdown continues.  Rolling on with the Worst of the Week Countdown.  Counting down the best moments this week on the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm Sam Roberts from Opie and Anthony.  And after Opie and Anthony Live, still to come on this year, Countdown,  we'll hear from Scott Thorson, the real-life Liberace boyfriend.  You saw Matt Damon play him in the HBO movie, the real-life dude, in studio. 
[00:24:30]  We'll hear from Ozzy Osbourne.  We'll hear about Anthony's wild weekend party that he threw last weekend.  Seth Rogen was in studio.  But we always love it when there are UFC guys in studio.  Rashad Evans stopped by, and God damn, is this guy strong-looking.  All these UFC guys are a man.  When they walk in the building, you understand what a man is capable of looking like.  Amen.  Not this man, but a man. 
[00:25:00]  And I don't think I would ever, I don't see how it's possible that I could ever look like that.  I could ever have that much machismo in me.  But apparently it is possible.  Rashad Evans proves it here as he stops by the Opie and Anthony show.  Number six.  What's up, Rashad?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Dude, you're cut.  You're ready to fucking fight, huh?  Yeah, I bet.  Holy shit. 
[00:25:30]  You look trimmer than the last time you were in here.  Yeah, I cut up a little bit, man.  I made sure that I got my weight under control early, but just been heavy in a gym lifting and stuff, you know?  Wow, fuck.  Serious.  I lost three times.  I can't have it.  Ah, shit.  What was the last fight?  It was Tito, right?  No.  Goodness gracious.  Who did you fight after Tito?  Goodness gracious.  Well, the last time I saw you, you had a bad injury after that fight.  Yeah.  That was the last time I saw you.  Yeah, I fought Phil Davis and then Jon Jones.  You were here for the Jon Jones fight. 
[00:26:00]  That was the last time we talked to Rashad.  Yeah.  Remember, you like to be putting jokes.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy T.  I know, and I officially can't do it now because he's just taunted me, so I can't.  It's just too homoerotic.  And we were rooting for you against Jon Jones.  Yeah.  Well, you gave him the toughest fight he's had.  Sorry.  Sorry about that.  Hey, you know, thank you.  I appreciate it.  I appreciate it.  But, yeah, I gave him a pretty, you know, tough fight, the toughest fight that he's had yet. 
[00:26:30]  But, you know, it wasn't my best performance, but, you know, I got to work my way back up there and try to do it again.  Well, you went five rounds with him.  I mean, and it seems like nobody has been able to do that.  Like, he's just, he's killing everybody.  And it seemed very frustrating for him that he probably just could not put you away.  He couldn't do it.  Yeah.  I mean, I took a couple good shots in that fight.  But, you know, that fight was an emotional fight for both of us.  So, you know, going through the fight, we just had a lot of tension.  And then even during a fight, it seemed to never, like, go away. 
[00:27:00]  You know, he was kind of, you know, he kind of didn't open up as well.  And I didn't open up as much as I could have either.  Right, right.  Did you guys talk afterwards?  No, I haven't talked to him since.  Actually, I seen him at a club in Vegas one time after the whole thing.  And I just said, what's up to him?  I said hi to him.  That was about it.  And he responded or was he cold?  No, he responded.  Wait, did you guys have a real problem?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm trying to remember now.  It was real life.  Oh, yeah.  Wait, they were friends and training partners for a long time? 
[00:27:30]  No, it all just came back to me.  I'm sorry.  Yes, of course.  All right.  Do you plan on resolving that or no?  I mean, you know, I don't have a problem with that.  I mean, if you want to talk, you know, I can talk.  But for the most part, I'm all right.  You don't care either way?  No.  I mean, you know, no, I don't really care.  But it's hard if you're mad at somebody, it seems like.  Because fighters can always seem to turn off those emotions.  But if you're mad at somebody and they're punching you in the face, or if you know that 
[00:28:00]  he's winning the round of the fight, that's got to just really add something to it.  It does, man.  It does.  Even after a fight, if you lose to somebody and you don't like them, it's just like  it makes it that much worse.  That much worse.  Did you take anything out of that?  Like, well, he couldn't, I mean, he couldn't tap me or he couldn't put me away.  Or do you?  No, I just felt like in myself, like, you know, I felt let down.  And I was really depressed after the fight, just like, man, how did this happen?  How come I couldn't, how come I didn't fight the way I could have fought?  Or how come I didn't do this?  And just a lot of stuff.  But after a while, you know, you learn to just put those feelings and thoughts away, 
[00:28:30]  because you can't go back.  You know, what's done is done.  You only can move forward.  Right.  What do you do to kind of like, if something like that happens, what do you do to get  yourself out of the emotional fog?  Like, if I have a bad show, you know, next day, two days later, I'm kind of over it.  But that's a much bigger thing.  Well, no, not to interrupt, but what you could do is get back on stage a lot quicker than  he could get back in.  Right.  So when you lose a big fight like that, you got to wait a long fucking time to really clear  it out of your system.  And you worked so hard for it. 
[00:29:00]  And that's the longest time.  It's like waiting for that chance for redemption again, you know, because you're only as good  as your last performance and everybody judges you off of that.  So, you know, if you lose your last fight and you suck doing it, then you suck until you  fight again and prove them otherwise.  Yeah.  We don't care if we suck all week.  If we have a good Friday show, we're good.  Yeah.  Because then the weekend is there.  We're like, oh, man, we killed it on Friday.  Yeah.  We go through the motions Monday through Thursday.  It's all about Friday, huh? 
[00:29:30]  Oh, we're just building up for Friday.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because that's what they remember.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a great show for the weekend.  Oh, I know.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you had a great week already.  Oh, I know.  I know we did.  What did you do on Deadliest Warrior?  I was, I guess, let me think.  What was I doing on Deadliest Warrior?  Pig carcass.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I stabbed the pig carcass.  No, what was the, because Deadliest Warrior kind of covers old school fighters, like from  gladiators. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, so mine was, I guess, the gladiators from that time versus, geez, I forgot what it  was.  Who was I going against?  I don't even remember.  It's been a long time.  I had too many shots in the head.  Yeah.  But that's what I say every time.  I can't remember nothing.  Oh, yeah, I got punched in the head.  That's a good excuse.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Or if I forget someone's name, I'm like, I did a lot of drugs.  But I quit when I was 18.  But it's still like an excuse I can use.  And people are like, all right, they don't want to question it.  So you don't remember who you're on with?  No, I think it was against Alexander the Great or something like that.  How did they pit you against a historical figure? 
[00:30:30]  I don't know.  It wasn't me per se.  It was warriors from that time versus warriors from that time.  So it was something like that.  So you threw something in a pig carcass?  Yeah, I threw a spear.  And that was it?  No, I did some grappling moves that those guys used to do.  Because I guess they used me because it was kind of talking about the fighting style  that those guys would use in the close quarter combat.  And it was a lot like MMA. 
[00:31:00]  Okay.  You were using your elbow.  Yeah, elbow.  And I was like, they were fish hooking, but you can't do that stuff in MMA now.  What's fish hooking?  Oh, God.  Oh, you grabbed the mouth.  Okay.  Was that ever legal?  Was that ever legal?  No, it was never legal.  Never legal.  Not even when they first started?  It seems like it would be just like a move that wouldn't hurt.  But that thing, you ever have somebody do fish hooking?  Oh, man.  You haven't had a fish hooking, Jimmy?  It's the worst feeling of all.  No, I wouldn't let anyone put their fingers in my mouth. 
[00:31:30]  Actually, it was just a curved penis.  It's just making it up.  Of course, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Yeah, that would be the worst part of a fish hook is the fingers.  Yeah, because you never know where people's hands are.  Right?  Yeah.  That would suck.  You remember that game when you were younger?  What did it smell like?  Oh, man.  Yeah, the fingers under the nose.  What did it smell like?  You do that, you smell it, and then he fish hooks you.  You're like, oh, shit, man.  Or wet fingers.  You used to stick your fingers wet in somebody's ear. 
[00:32:00]  Like, that was all funny, but there's nothing more disgusting.  That's disgusting.  That's disgusting.  I didn't think that was funny at all.  No, I did back in, you know, I was stoned.  You know, someone's driving.  I wouldn't mind a girl doing it.  You know.  Girls have got to really do something bad to be disgusting.  They could shove their fucking fingers in my mouth.  I don't care.  Do something bad to be disgusting.  You're like, what?  Like, turn 18?  And you came out in support, which I thought was really great. 
[00:32:30]  Like, you came out in support of, like, gay rights and gay marriage and stuff, which I  think is a lot of fighters probably feel the same way you do, but are scared to kind of  come out and support that, which I think was nice.  Yeah.  One of my friends, Brendan Anion Badejo, he plays for the Ravens, or used to play for  the Ravens, you know, we were talking about it and talking about a lot of issues that  they face, and, you know, I wasn't really aware, you know, I wasn't really aware of 
[00:33:00]  something that just wasn't on my radar at the time, but, you know, after talking to him  and stuff like that, he put me on a ballot, and, you know, then, you know, and then I  started getting more actively involved.  Put you on a ballot.  What does that mean?  Like, like, people who was in support for.  Yeah, people who was in support for.  And, you know, I started to get more actively involved and started to speak about it and  stuff like that, but, you know, I don't, I definitely, you know, I definitely am for  equal rights.  What did he say that kind of, or what was it, an example or something that kind of pushed 
[00:33:30]  you into, oh, wow, I didn't realize that was happening.  Well, it was just about, like, you know, you know, the rights they have when they're living  together, being a partner and stuff like that, and some of, you know, the issues that they  have with that.  And, you know, I was just thinking about it from my point of view of, like, you know,  if I had a kid, and, well, I do have a kid, but if one of my kids become, decide they're  going to be, you know, be with somebody of the same sex when they get older, it would  be, it would be a shame if they couldn't get the same rights that somebody that was 
[00:34:00]  married would be able to get, you know, for the benefit of, for both of them.  Do you think there's any, I mean, there has to be, statistically or numerically, are there  any gay fighters in the UFC?  There has to be, again, the odds, the numbers say that there are.  There actually is.  A woman fighter named Liz Carmouche.  Okay.  Yeah.  But I think it's easier for a woman, more acceptable.  I think what we're talking about is, he's saying openly, but you're saying he's got it.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe not.  Yeah.  Because you talked to, like, when Charles Barkley goes, oh my God, we all played with gay 
[00:34:30]  players, but none of those guys came out.  Sure.  But they just knew.  Right.  Yeah, I'm sure there's some fighters who, who probably gay, but there's never come out  and say, you know.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  That's going to be hard for sports guys.  Yeah, it's definitely hard for sports, especially a fight guy.  Right, right, yeah.  Especially a fight guy.  And then even, even more, because, you know, the positions that we do and we train, you know,  some of those positions.  Right, right.  I kind of like, you know, if, if, if some guy is homophobic, you might be like, I don't 
[00:35:00]  want to do that with that guy.  Right, right.  He might like it too much.  So that's what, you know, it could be a big fear with coming out.  Okay.  You know.  But is there ever, do you think ever in a fight, like, even if you're a complete homosexual,  do you really think that you're getting turned on when, even if you're locked up close,  when the other guy is jamming his elbow into your ribs?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, it doesn't, that's, it doesn't seem like any fighter would be excited by that  because it's just like you're trying to beat the shit out of the other guy.  Yeah, I mean, I mean, not at all.  You know, if someone is, is gay or whatever case may be, that doesn't necessarily mean 
[00:35:30]  that they find you attractive.  Yeah.  I think it's an ignorance there that people would think like, oh, I don't want to grapple  with that guy.  He's going to, it's like, what's he going to do?  You know, stop.  And there's the fight, the one fight, the fighter who is, I guess, transsexual, who went  from male to female, I think.  And he's fighting.  I actually, I actually watched her fight in South Florida.  She fought on the card recently in South Florida, earlier this month.  What did you think? 
[00:36:00]  What did I think?  Yeah.  There was a lot of controversy there.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, she, I don't think she had a physical edge at all.  Oh, really?  Oh, wow.  No, I don't.  Surprisingly, she didn't.  I would have thought for sure she had a physical edge, but she, she didn't.  You know, it was like, it looked like it was evenly matched fight.  But Rogan made a good point about that.  Like, it wasn't being homophobic or being, but he said something about because you're  born male, like he's talking about bone structure and, and like a muscle structure and things 
[00:36:30]  like things that just the males of our species are born with or whatever the connective tissue  is.  Right.  He said these things that they don't even identify you as far as like, you know, if you  want to say you're a woman, you're a woman.  But like these things that you're born with, uh, does that do you think make an advantage?  Because that was his point, which I thought was valid.  I mean, uh, you know, anatomically, yes, it should.  It should.  I mean, there's just not enough, uh, you know, uh, sex hormone therapy or whatever.  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  That can get rid of that.  Right.  But for the most part, I'm talking about when I seen her fight myself, it did not look like  she had a physical advantage of the girl that she was fighting.  Who won?  Uh, you know what?  I left.  Oh, yeah.  I'm out of here.  I didn't sit and watch the whole thing.  I left.  You went outside to join the protest?  No, I mean, yeah, yeah.  So it's just a curiosity thing.  He's like, oh, let me see what this is all about.  I want to see what it's all about. 
[00:37:30]  Right.  And I was like, all right, I'm going to get out of here.  That's funny.  You know, one of the things with UFC is, like, boxing doesn't interest me anymore because  there's no fighters I care.  I mean, there's Mayweather and there's a few guys that are great, but, like, Mayweather's  like the only personality I really care about.  And, uh, I think that's helped UFC is the fact that there's no, like, if Mike Tyson was  coming up now, he's somebody that everybody wants to watch.  And I think the fact that there's nobody like that in boxing for a while, everybody kind  of turned and was watching UFC and just began to love you guys.  I think it helped you a lot that there was no marquee or not many marquee fighters in 
[00:38:00]  boxing.  And then people get kind of hooked into UFC and now it just doesn't matter.  Yeah.  I think that's a big part of it.  But I think another big part is the fact that the shows that we put on, you know, if  you watch a UFC card, you're going to watch it from the first fight all the way to the  main event and be entertained the whole time through, you know, that's one thing that  boxing really does not do.  They don't put a strong card together where you're going to watch every single fight and  be entertained the whole time.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, there have been so many bouts.  You're watching, you're just like, all right, come on. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, look, they're hugging again.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  And I think the turnaround time, how could you have that many name people in boxing, stars,  that are fighting consistently?  It just didn't happen.  It just does not happen.  Remember having to go like, well, okay, I guess we'll see him fight in another year or  something.  But UFC, I mean, bam, you guys are in there all the time.  There's another pay-per-view, there's another big event going on, and a whole other group.  How many fights you got a year, Ab? 
[00:39:00]  At least three fights a year.  Yeah.  You do three?  Yeah, three fights a year.  Wow.  But there's also so many superstars.  There's so many guys that...  You were lucky to see Ali or Tyson once.  Well, Tyson started pushing a little bit.  He would do more than one a year.  Well, Tyson, when he first came on, he fought a lot.  Yeah, because he didn't get hurt in these fights, so they're like, all right, fuck it,  get another fight.  But see, that's what boxing was at the strongest.  Boxing was at the strongest when they had the...  Remember, you used to come on ABC Worldwide of Sports?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:39:30]  Remember that back then?  On Saturdays, you'd be able to watch it, and Saturday afternoon, you'd watch it.  Did you say Worldwide of Sports?  Worldwide of Sports, yeah.  Wide World of Sports.  Was it Wide World of Sports?  Wide World of Sports.  Something didn't sound right there.  I'm like, did I...  Yeah, was it Wide World of Sports.  You're correcting Rashad Evans.  I understood that he got it wrong.  I wasn't going to say anything.  Wide World of Sports.  What's wrong with you?  Because I didn't know if I had just heard World of Sports.  It was a weird moment.  Like, I was like, something's wrong.  Something didn't feel right.  All right, all right.  Wide World of Sports.  Yeah, on ABC.  But that's when it was at the strongest, when you used to see it consistently on TV. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And that's one thing UFC is doing now, is that they're always putting it on TV, so people  have a chance to really get connected to the sport.  And Dana is so passionate about what he does.  He shows through with the product.  You know, he brought it up from nothing.  You know, so for him, this is his baby.  And he's so frustrated it's not legal in New York.  You saw the map the other day.  It's pretty much legal around the world, except for one little fucking spot.  Everywhere in Canada and in the United States, except for this sickening union issue in New 
[00:40:30]  York that Sheldon Silver and the rest of these guys, it's absolutely embarrassing and  disgusting.  And Connecticut's going to make the money, and New Jersey's going to make the money.  Good.  I don't even care if it's in New York, because I just go to Jersey and watch it.  So let the dummies in New York lose money because of the union.  I know that the Garden's fighting for it, and they'll get it, if it's not this year,  the next year, I mean.  Yeah, they'll get it.  It's just too bad that politics has to play out.  And for them to lie and say it's over the violence issue of that, it's like, just stop 
[00:41:00]  it.  It is not that.  That isn't the issue.  You're embarrassing yourself at this point when you look at that map and see everyone  else has accepted this sport.  Is it done in New York for this year or no?  Not yet.  Has that not been decided yet?  Well, I'm not really sure it's not done.  What?  But is it still possible for it to be legalized in New York this year or no?  Not really.  Has that passed?  I think so.  The time has passed then?  I believe so.  Yeah, we're going to have to wait another year, I think.  Yeah, I think they were lobbying a couple months ago. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, I think that's done again.  I don't know.  God, hateable.  But Rashad is fighting Dan Henderson, who did not look good in his last fight, I didn't  think, against Machida.  And he just couldn't.  I guess Machida's a really weird fighter.  You know, he's off.  Yeah, Machida's weird.  You know, he was hard for Dan to get his hands on, moving around and being as elusive  as he was.  It seems like Dan relies on, and again, I'm not criticizing Henderson because he has a right  hand like a fucking shotgun blast.  But it's got to be harder, like, when you're only relying on that one, I think that kind 
[00:42:00]  of undid Fedor at one point, and I think it's one thing that will hurt Roy Nelson, is  like when you're just waiting on that one punch, when you know the right is coming, it's a little  bit easier, I guess, to avoid.  It is a little bit easier, you know, but that's when you've got to add a few more wrinkles  to the game, you know?  So I'm thinking maybe he's going to come with a little more, because he realized in his  fight with Machida that, you know, he needed probably a little more, so he's probably going  to come with maybe a left hook, left hook, right hand, I don't know.  It seems like he's impossible to knock out, too. 
[00:42:30]  Like, he's a fucking...  Yeah, he's got, he's got a, you know, a good, good chin, and...  Thick, thick, fucking head.  Oh, big ass, fucking thick, thick, thick, thick, thick, thick, fucking head.  But he's tough, he's tough, he's real tough, you know, and he's got that mindset like  he's not going to stop him no matter what.  Big fucking melon.  Yeah.  Big fucking melon head, you dick-headed motherfucker.  Yeah, just a fucking, like, a Java man head.  A Viking head.  He really does.  It's a thick, fucking punch absorber.

And after Opie and Anthony Live, counting down the best moments on this week's Opie and Anthony show.  Still to come, the real life Scott Thorson, Liberace's ex-boyfriend from the movie in studio. 
[00:48:00]  Ozzy Osbourne in studio.  Seth Rogen in studio.  But let's talk about, what do you say, Robert Zimmerman.  You know, George Zimmerman, Trayvon Martin, maybe the biggest court case in the country right now.  Arguably so, I would say.  And it's certainly been on the forefront of Anthony Cumia's mind.  Well, George Zimmerman's brother, Robert Zimmerman, has been an outspoken supporter of his brother. 
[00:48:30]  He's been all over Twitter talking about this case.  He was there when they were selecting the jury.  And he was there on the Opie and Anthony show.  To give us the inside scoop on this George Zimmerman, Trayvon Martin case, here it is.  Robert Zimmerman on the Opie and Anthony show.  Number five.  Anything happening in court today?  Yeah, I'm...  Still jury selection?  Still jury selection.  The Fry hearing has not concluded.  So there's not a conclusive decision about the expert testimony. 
[00:49:00]  And we'll see, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  That's...  It was just...  Ah, it's such a chore, like, watching these.  Because it's really a grind.  It just seems to...  And I'm sure you guys obviously want this resolved as quickly as possible.  And then to watch some of this line of questioning going, like, it's so tedious.  It's so tedious.  There's a juror consultant, which is, you know, a specialist in selecting jurors. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, man.  Which is just...  It's uncanny.  But it's...  Hopefully we get to justice.  You know, and hopefully there's a result.  I hope the result is respected.  That's what I really...  Right, right.  Now, obviously, the emotions attached to this case, a lot of times, things like this transcend facts and transcend actual justice.  Your concerns about that? 
[00:50:00]  My concerns about that, I don't want to sound overly legal, but there are what are called lesser included offenses and things like that.  But, for example, if you are charged with murder, too, you can be convicted with manslaughter or negligent manslaughter.  And my concern with that is that sometimes juries don't exist in a vacuum.  When you're on jury duty for two weeks or three weeks at a time, somebody notices.  You know, somebody realizes you're not going to work.  Somebody realizes you're not walking the dog.  Or somebody realizes you're not doing whatever you would have been doing, you know, every day. 
[00:50:30]  And then you know how the news is.  Yeah.  Is it one of these 30 people?  And then is it one of these 10?  And we think it might be one of these eight or whatever.  You know, so I think that sometimes in a case like this or others, juries have, they have pressure.  I think jurors can rise to the occasion.  And I believe in the way that our system is set up.  But I certainly, as a family member, I'm concerned that they might have a lot of pressure to do something, as it were. 
[00:51:00]  Right, right.  Something.  Now, that isn't true justice.  That's trying to compromise somebody's legal right.  I don't think it would be a factor, but for the racial element that has been kind of woven into this whole story.  Exactly, yes, yes.  Can I ask you, what is the, how frustrating is it to see the media doing, behaving?  Because on what side of the case people, the media has been fairly repulsive so far.  Well, this is some of Robert's biggest complaints on Twitter and stuff, is the way the media has handled this. 
[00:51:30]  That's where the bulk of that real anger is, right?  The editing of that audio, regardless, the editing of that audio is unforgivable.  Yeah.  And it's clear what the intention of it was.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  It's been repulsive.  And I think one of the things that has happened to me is that I was, I was kind of, you know, protesting by myself, but now looking back, I have like a year to look back on of people saying the same thing. 
[00:52:00]  And I've been listening to this for a long time, and I'm kind of now just repeating or summarizing what people's frustrations are.  It's not just me.  You could go to a cut and paste list of answers to some of these people, because it's the same inaccurate information that they're, and it's been dispelled by a lot of people, yet they don't want to accept that that never happened.  This is the way it went down.  And as all this evidence comes in, especially during the court case, people will still not want to believe it, not even look at it, and they'd rather go off ill-informed, because it better fits their emotional response to this whole thing. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, putting fact before emotion is difficult, especially when emotion has been so misinformed for so long.  But, you know, we'll see what happens.  Have they mischaracterized your brother, too?  I mean, whenever you see a family member or a friend being talked about publicly, I think it's probably rare that they get it right.  Yeah, I don't think it's only mischaracterized. 
[00:53:00]  I think there was kind of this vacuum at the beginning of information.  There was kind of like this black hole made around George, and everybody got to fill in their, you know, mythological version of George that was not anything like George.  But George has, he's a real person.  He met the jurors yesterday in questioning, and I think that's important because they can see that he's not just some news story or some, you know, icon on the screen that flashes by with a narrative.  He's a real human being.  It is hard to see that, but a real person, I mean, a lot of people following this case, you know, it's the guy on TV, it's that picture, it's, you know, one photograph, and, you know, that's your brother. 
[00:53:30]  This is your family.  Right, exactly.  And it's got to be weird, too.  You're regular citizens.  Like, you're not meant to be, like, you know, on the news.  Like, you're just a regular dude going to work, and the next thing you know, your brother's in the news, and you're on CNN talking about your brother who's like, like, what a reality shift.  I mean, and, you know, Trayvon Martin's family, too, I'm sure, has the same thing. 
[00:54:00]  All of a sudden, the regular people, the tragedy, and now they're on television, kind of quasi-celebrities talking about what's going on.  Right.  I think it's, I've characterized it before as a reluctant duty, but it's not just a duty to my brother.  I think it's a duty to my country, because I don't want to see people charged with crimes without probable cause simply to appease the masses.  I don't think that's the right thing to do, and I think that's what happened here, and I'll continue to be vocal about it each and every time it happens. 
[00:54:30]  And what is the, what is the exact, you guys are, you're half Mexican, half white, or whatever.  What is your, because they were going with the white, and they could, what's that?  What?  White Hispanic.  White Hispanic.  White Hispanic.  White Hispanic.  They could not, I've never heard that term used.  Right.  Until this case, they couldn't get white into it fast enough.  It didn't fit the narrative any other way.  They need a white on black crime.  Right.  That's what they wanted, and they heard the name Zimmerman, so they're like, oh, okay, this is great, and then you guys turn out to be Hispanic, and they're like, wait a minute, no, no, no, let's get rid of that whole part. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, that irony kind of repeated our whole life of our mom being very Hispanic from Peru.  She does not look white.  She is not white.  You know, so sometimes we'd be in school or at the doctor's office, and they'd say, you know, Mrs. Zimmerman, and she'd get up with her kids, and they'd look at her like, oh, this poor lady doesn't speak.  I don't speak English, you know, or whatever, and they'd be like, no, no, no, we said Mrs. Zimmerman. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, no.  She's just like, yeah.  Yeah, that's me.  Yeah, that's me.  Right, but that's that kind of, I mean, it was like the inverse, where now we had that name meant white, you know, right away, and we did not retroactively inject race and say, wait, but we're Hispanic, because I think that's kind of a moot point and kind of draws more.  It sure is, yeah.  Yeah.  What's the other half of the family?  White.  A what?  Like German?  German white.  Zimmerman. 
[00:56:00]  That's where our name comes from.  That's what I figured.  It's German.  Okay.  Just making sure.  So half German, half Hispanic.  That's right.  Now, is this a, I heard this jury is not sequestered?  The pool is not sequestered.  The order as it stands, my understanding is that it is not sequestered thus far, though the court may readdress that at some other point.  But the jury...  Because it's such a volatile kind of atmosphere.  Right, and there are differences and advantages and disadvantages.  Sometimes when you have a sequestered jury, for example, people may figure out that you're just gone, you know, for three weeks, four weeks at a time. 
[00:56:30]  When the jury's not sequestered, you can go home and go back to work, as it were, you know, on the jury.  So they may not figure out necessarily that you're doing jury duty.  And there are, you know, there's advantages and disadvantages, so we'll see how it plays out.  But definitely I would have preferred, just speaking as a family member, what's called the veneer or the pool to be sequestered.  Because I think that the objective, seemingly, is for the jury to have some kind of anonymity. 
[00:57:00]  But when you don't have that pool of 500 people sequestered to begin with, I think you lose any real anonymity in reality.  Yeah, yeah.  And you're right about one thing, and I've had mixed feelings about this case, to be very honest.  Anthony's 100% for your brother, and I played devil's advocate too, but I really, to be totally honest, I'm very, I don't know how to feel about it.  There's times where I feel like he was wrong, and there's times where I feel like, yeah, man, it's just an unfortunate thing, but he was defending his own life.  I don't know how, I think a lot of people don't know how to see this. 
[00:57:30]  Like, you only know what's being said from both sides, and it's like, I can't get a definitive 100% opinion on it.  Right.  Again, I think if you look at it emotionally, you're going to have much more of a difficult time assessing what happened and the legality of it.  If you do look at it legally and look at the evidence that is being presented,  and I think you get more of a line that, yes, here's a man who felt his life was in danger and being threatened to be taken away from him 
[00:58:00]  and defended himself in kind and saved his life.  That's the legal part of this.  Did that happen?  Right.  Now, emotionally, you could be like, well, was he just a boy with, you know, with iced tea and Skittles?  He's unarmed.  Was he this sweet kid?  Did Zimmerman, was he walking around like he was the, you know, the boss of this block or something? 
[00:58:30]  And all that is this peripheral interference.  And I think if you could try to weed that out, you get much more of an accurate depiction of what happened  and where this should go when this trial does end.  And it's also hard to get, like, because when you look at, like, the fact that he had the back of the head injury  and the press just didn't want to show that.  So that actually makes me think that Zimmerman's telling more of the truth.  Yeah, neither did seemingly the state because it took them a long time to get that image produced 
[00:59:00]  from a black and white grainy photograph to the actual full-color, high-definition image  of what George actually looked like in the back of that police car.  Again, it didn't fit the narrative of, first of all, why he was even arrested after, you know,  I guess the police that were on the scene and from witnesses that gave their account to the police on the scene,  obviously they decided he was justified in what he did. 
[00:59:30]  At least maybe a grand jury could look at it or whatnot.  But at that time, they didn't deem it necessary to arrest him.  And I think that they would have wanted any shred of probable cause to arrest him.  I think there were enormous political and other pressures.  And I think those people were men and women of honor that despite the pressure, despite the politics,  despite the clamoring, they were faithful to their oath.  They said, the law is the law.  We arrest with probable cause. 
[01:00:00]  And I think Chief Lee, who now doesn't have a job, and everybody else who doesn't have a job now  would have wanted any inkling of probable cause to say, you're under arrest for whatever,  for anything, for criminal escalation, let's say, or whatever the case may be.  And you don't charge people with crimes in this country, hopefully, and that will remain the standard  because people are concerned about politics or race or whatever.  It's a very explosive racial issue.  And I know, just from Twitter, discussing the case with you on Twitter, 
[01:00:30]  the second you defend your brother and defend him with facts, with facts based on the case,  based on what the police saw on the scene, based on what witnesses heard and saw,  and you defend your brother, you are labeled a racist.  It's astounding to me.  And that's more offensive than somebody defending your brother based on facts. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, I call it the crying wolf scenario that we have.  It's kind of twofold.  It's one that where there is real racism, we should reserve that word for when we have  a real glaring example of, this is racism and we can't stand for that.  But the other side of that is that I think the standard has devolved to where, for example,  if you say, hey, Jim, I think you're a thief.  It's probably because you stole my eraser.  And I've seen you do that two or three times.  Or whatever.  My stapler, you're always stealing my stapler.  So you have to have some grounds for making an accusation. 
[01:01:30]  I think now this racist word has become kind of a word you just throw out.  And then someone has to retroactively prove that they are not, in fact, a racist.  Right.  You know, and make a career out of proving, like, I'm not a racist.  And throw their arms up and just go into this whole effort of proving that they're not.  And I don't think that's the right standard.  The criteria for being called a racist has changed so much over the years.  But now it's, I disagree with someone of color or with a different religious background.  Whatever it is, you disagree. 
[01:02:00]  You are now arguing your point.  Right.  Now you're a racist.  Although I will say it.  You make the criteria from 1810 on.  You're an ass.  No, you know what?  And again, it's back to the press because, like, I've argued this, I've talked to this,  even I didn't get into it with black comics at the Comedy Cell, just chatting about it.  And, like, and they're very passionate about it.  And then you hear what they say, like, look, this, this, this.  And it's like, these guys aren't lying. 
[01:02:30]  That's what they've learned in the press.  And a lot of times you hear something like the audio that came out and you don't follow  it closely enough to hear the corrected version.  Right.  So a lot of people are going, the media does not correct themselves on the front page.  They do it on page eight or they do it quietly.  Oh, here's the actual audio.  They don't come out with the same vigor and correct themselves.  Well, one of the best things I've seen on the news of late with the various things that  have happened in the Boston bombing, when they try to just jump on the story and get 
[01:03:00]  a little premature, is, well, the earlier reports had it this way, but it was this way.  It's like, wait a minute.  You were the ones.  You were the ones.  You were the ones that said it.  You guys were the ones that pushed it forward.  Don't make it sound like it was this vague information that came into you.  You jumped the gun and reported it this way.  Right.  And with your brother's case, it's obvious they did the same thing.  Right.  They wanted this to be some type of racial injustice that was going on.  They wanted the reason that this happened was that your brother was obviously a racist 
[01:03:30]  and he was just out to hurt someone of color that night.  And looking at the facts, it seems especially that nothing could be further from the truth.  I think hopefully going forward from this, I mean, we're having this conversation now.  There are things that get, like you said, the Boston bombing, you know, and whatnot, that  get misreported and earlier reports suggest, as it were, you know, but I don't think we 
[01:04:00]  can afford to do that with race.  I think race and the word racist or racism need to have a very revered place in light of  the civil rights legacy.  I think there is a point to respecting what those words actually mean, you know, in our  language.  You're taking the sting out of it and the reality out of it if you just throw it on something  that is absolutely not racist.  Right.  I couldn't agree more.  I mean, that has to be what comes from this in the end is that we have to understand that 
[01:04:30]  the media acted with incompetence.  They took the word of these attorneys, you know, spinning this with who have now proven  financial motives in the outcome of this narrative, and they reported their story as fact, and  that's the definition of incompetence.  Right.  If you take the word of people who stand to make money or millions from getting people to  believe something, that's the very definition of incompetence.  So I think when you add race to that, we need to say, you know, never again after this 
[01:05:00]  case.  Yeah.  When you see something like justice for Trayvon, and then you say something like, how about  justice for George?  Again, you're called racist if you say something like that.  Absolutely.  Doesn't just saying justice for Trayvon tip the scales?  I think it's a hard, I'm not a black man, as you all can see, so it's very hard for me  to make this argument sometimes, but I think that our country has the original sin, as it 
[01:05:30]  were, of slavery, of racism, you know, and I think that sometimes people, or I should say  racism vis-a-vis slavery, you know, via slavery, and I think that sometimes people are responding  emotionally to very straightforward facts, and I think that I can't blame them for feeling  the way they do, Jim, when you brought up the tapes, you know, and the editing and whatnot.  If you think that the news informs, if you are still that misinformed, that you actually 
[01:06:00]  think that the news informs you, and that is how you are informed, that this is what actually  happened, I don't have any problem with that.  You know, it doesn't help us, but if that's what you really think, because that's what  you're being told 24 hours a day, seven days a week, you know, I would feel the same way  if I were so misinformed, you know, I know my own brother, I know what actually happened,  so I don't feel that way, but I think that the challenge is getting people that are reacting 
[01:06:30]  emotionally, and having emotional commitments to the narrative, to start to think intellectually  about what actually happened, and start kind of divorcing those two elements between the  feeling and the fact, and getting to the bottom of it.  Very hard to do with race.  With race.  Almost impossible.  I mean, you saw a very polarized support basis with the OJ trial, and that's really the last  real, I mean, huge racial trial in this country, but you see it here. 
[01:07:00]  You see it here, I mean, there are people, it is so divided on racial lines as to who's  supported here, and I think, I think justice should be what is supported here, and the  evidence, in fact, should dictate how you feel about the, when this trial ends, and there  is a verdict, how you feel about that verdict should be based on nothing but what did happen. 
[01:07:30]  Right.  And the best of people's ability to present what really did happen, and keep that emotion  out of it.  Very, very key, because our system is not perfect, but I do believe it's the best in the world,  and it kind of is like this filter, right, for what is allowed in and what's not in court.  You know, so emotion doesn't play in court.  No.  Facts do.  It's what the blindfold's for.  Yeah, exactly, right, and I think that that will be, that's why I'm glad that so many members 
[01:08:00]  of the public are attending, they're handling that lottery really well.  Right.  I think that the public has to participate to respect the outcome, and I think that, you  know, going forward, it should be about justice and not about color, and we should have a reflex  after a case like this to whenever somebody brings up race, no matter what the race is,  if it's white, if it's, I don't care what the race, or if it's an invented race, like  white Hispanic, you know, because we'll have other invented races, right, we should throw 
[01:08:30]  up a red flag and say, not so fast, and then never again, you know, because it doesn't  do us any good to come to these foregone conclusions based on emotion about what may  or may not have happened when something is so sensitive and so tragic, it doesn't help  us, it's a disservice to us, and it should be about fact.  And there's a day and age with, of course, Twitter, social media, has anybody been concerned  that you're being very vocal and public on Twitter about the case? 
[01:09:00]  After, I announced yesterday that after the jury is selected, I was not going to tweet  anymore.  Oh, really?  No, not at all.  Now, is this, has this been on the recommendation of lawyers, or is this just your personal?  No, my attorney personally says that my First Amendment right applies, you know, until the  rule of sequestration is invoked.  If there is a rule of sequestration, that's a very legal term.  Now, that's so, if you're in court, and you're seeing stuff.  You have to get out.  Right, right, yeah.  And you can't talk about it. 
[01:09:30]  Sure.  And whatnot.  So, until that point, I should feel free to take advantage of the First Amendment, is  what I've been told.  Now, you've taken some hits with some of your tweets.  People have said, oh, my God, he's ruining his brother's case, or he's, again, he's being  a racist, he's saying that.  Right.  I guess one of the most controversial ones was comparing one of the killers of the baby.  Right, right.  To Trayvon in some way, shape, or form.  You put two of the pictures together.  A little about that. 
[01:10:00]  What happened?  I think, you know, I think people who don't want to hear, or accept, or believe, because  they have seen images of a 12 or 13-year-old child, that this person could have done what  he did to George, Mr. Martin, and he could have said what he said to George, and you're  going to die tonight, Mother Effer, and then reach for his gun.  They don't want to believe that, you know, but what happened there was kind of similar  wording, you know, and it would have gone to that in my mind, had George not defended  his life in that instant, but I think that Twitter is a wacky world, so I'm going to 
[01:10:30]  leave it alone, you know, for the trial, and just let that, let the judicial system take  its course.  More of the O.E. and Anthony Warrens to the week.  Countdown.  Next.

The Worst of the Week Countdown continues.  Worst of the Week Countdown continues on the Opie and Anthony channel.  Sam Roberts here from the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:15:00]  And after Opie and Anthony Live, a lot to get to as we count down the best things that  happened on the Opie and Anthony show this week, including Scott Thorson, the real-life  Liberace ex-boyfriend from the movie that Matt Damon played.  That guy, he was in studio.  So was Ozzy.  So was Seth Rogen.  We'll get to all that.  Right now, I want to talk about Anthony Cumia.  Of course, I don't know whose choice it is when it comes to selecting interns.  I'm not complaining about it.  But somebody, in their infinite wisdom, thought that two hot girls would make good Opie and 
[01:15:30]  Anthony interns.  Well, they've been a distraction, to say the least.  Last week, Anthony, at the last minute, on Friday of last week, decided, I'm going to  throw a party at my house.  And you know what?  I'm going to invite the interns.  Not all three interns, but definitely the two that happened to be hot chicks.  It got awkward, to say the least.  But the party ended up swell, so I hear Anthony came back on Monday to give us the lowdown 
[01:16:00]  on what happened at the Cumia compound.  The dinosaur was a big hit.  There was a line of people waiting to take pictures with the dinosaur.  To do their Vine video with the dinosaur.  Exactly.  A little Vine video, some photos.  It was amazing.  Everybody took photos with the dinosaur?  Everyone was taking photos with the dinosaur.  It's weird, because you only posted one photo of people with the dinosaur.  Oh!  Well, that was my photo. 
[01:16:30]  That's the only picture that made it alive.  My photo.  You with the two hot interns and the dinosaur in the background.  But everyone else was taking pictures in front of the dinosaur.  I didn't see everybody else, but there was a line of people.  Two interns and two dinosaurs.  Yes.  Indeed.  Jesus.  All right.  We'll just assume that everyone else took a picture in front of the dinosaur.  You only posted one picture.  Whether they want to post them or not, that's their prerogative.  You didn't get pictures with Salad or anything in front of the... 
[01:17:00]  No, not really.  What about you and E-Rock?  Not really.  No.  Considering E-Rock was the reason why I threw the party, you would assume that there would  be a couple of pictures of you and him being pals.  You're misinterpreting this.  E-Rock wasn't the reason I threw the party.  I've got to say that.  It wasn't.  The reason I threw the party was to cover up that it was just going to be me and E-Rock.  You know, because I had invited E-Rock over to get him away from the dildo party.  But you would never just invite him over.  So already in your head... 
[01:17:30]  It was a spur-of-the-moment thing like, you know what?  I'm thinking to myself, it's a Saturday.  E-Rock, what do you...  I've got nothing going on.  E-Rock doesn't want to...  You know, he's not just going to drive around his neighborhood until the dildo party's over.  So why not come over?  E-Rock, you think he would just invite you over to his house?  I would.  E-Rock without a motive?  Um, sure.  I don't think you would care if E-Rock was stuck at a lemon party.  All right, we'll buy it.  What the hell?  It just turned out to be a great opportunity to have a party. 
[01:18:00]  So the dinosaur's in place.  You've got Steve Cook in.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What else?  The pool was very nice.  The temperature was perfect.  Crystal clear blue water.  You had to fill it up with some hose water?  Uh, well...  Because the leak is still not fixed, right?  No, the leak is not fixed.  All right, but you made sure there was plenty of water before the party started.  There was plenty of water.  And the monsoon we wound up having Friday actually got the pool filled up to the...  The brim.  Right to the brim.  Perfect.  Yeah, yeah.  But the heaters were working. 
[01:18:30]  It was wonderful.  It was various places that...  Outside, downstairs, the karaoke, the poker table,  the inside, just chit-chatting, watching some TV.  Every bit of the house was being equally represented.  It was very successful.  Safe to say the party was boring until Roland showed up to really pump it up?  Well, they showed up pretty early.  Oh, all right.  They did show up pretty early, which was good.  But he really pumped it up.  He pumped it up.  Roland knows how to just bring the whole thing together. 
[01:19:00]  He just sits there and yells and screams at people.  He does.  He sits there.  Not in a bad way.  Drinks heavily.  Oh, and...  Yeah, can we play this?  That's one of his...  Oh, DJ!  Danny, play the hits!  Now!  Go home.  Go home, DJ!  Danny!  That's when Danny...  Danny Falcone, of course, DJ, with his hard drive of hits,  he showed up.  Out of nowhere?  Well, no, I invited him.  You got him.  I needed him to DJ the party. 
[01:19:30]  You hired him to DJ?  Oh, yeah, once the late-night festivities really got rolling,  I figured we needed somebody there to rock the party.  Some tunes.  Yes, to get up there, and boy, he had just come from a communion party out on Long Island,  so it was close.  Right.  So it was very easy for him to get over there in his suit.  And set up?  And set up.  He had the lights going, and...  I saw that he...  There he is.  I saw the Vine video where he was using his catchphrase. 
[01:20:00]  He was using his catchphrase.  Is this a hot mic?  Hot mic?  Hot mic?  Oh, it was fantastic.  And I bet you everyone just started laughing and laughing.  Oh, amazing.  And then I hear some people dancing.  Oh, yeah, people dancing.  What do you mean, some people dancing?  You barely pan to the left.  What do you mean, some people dancing?  Well, there's...  I wanted to get Sal in frame.  Yeah, you get that.  You got to...  You got three lovely ladies.  Yes. 
[01:20:30]  I was going to say three interns, but two hot interns and another very hot individual.  Yes.  And then you slightly pan to the left to almost show the rest of the party.  Well, I had to show...  Your eight seconds of the Vine video, seven and a half were on the hot girls, and a half a  second for that guy.  Well, Mikey Cuffs.  Right.  And there's Sal in the background, and...  Usually, if people are going to show the party, they would kind of move along.  Why would I want to...  You know, if I did that, then people would complain, dude, why didn't you just stay on 
[01:21:00]  the girls?  So I figured I'd help out the people that were watching.  Do you realize that there were more people at your party than those three girls?  Yeah, I heard.  Okay, all right.  Is there how many interns we've had in here that have wanted to get invited to one of  these parties?  Oh, right.  These interns have been here for one week.  A week!  They made impressions.  They were very nice.  And by the way, everyone...  They had a great time, I believe.  I'm sure.  Everyone had fun, and it was...  They weren't harassed or anything. 
[01:21:30]  They got there and home very safely.  It was very good.  I made sure, you know, everything was good with that.  I didn't want to be, you know, like Travis kicking people in the nuts.  And then another Vine video where it just shows the three girls, and a very quick shot  of Denny playing the music.  It's, uh...  Yeah, look.  And then there's Sal.  Did you see Sal?  Barely.  Oh, well, he was there.  What we're looking at is a slow pants to the left where you see hot girl, hot girl, hot 
[01:22:00]  girl.  Sal!  Denny bike!  And then the Vine video starts over again.  Well, you know...  You really don't understand...  You don't understand how to pace that eight seconds yet, I guess.  Well, it's six seconds.  It's very difficult.  Oh, you were probably pacing for eight.  I was.  See?  I ran out of time.  I needed to get Denny on there.  It's six seconds.  Is it eight?  Sometimes it's seven.  Oh, it's very difficult to gauge.  Yeah.  Very difficult.  All right, well...  But, uh...  Oh, look at that. 
[01:22:30]  All right, here's another Vine video.  I'm in there.  Oh, wait a minute.  Sal and the Three Girls.  Well, no, there's Sal in the back.  Sal in the back.  Well...  How much attention to Sal, Lee?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  This video obviously has nothing to do with him, and he's popping his head up in the background.  He loves it.  Now, Sal's good for the video, though.  He's just like, hey, look at me and Sal.  Hey, I know.  That's what it was all about.  So it's Anthony and the Three Hot Girls again.  That's what it was about.  So this is just a series of videos of Sal dancing.  Sal dancing.  He loves having his hand up like he's directing traffic, so... 
[01:23:00]  And Denny with his music too loud.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy...  The second Jimmy got there, he, like, showed up.  He said hi.  Went right over to Denny to tell him to turn that shit down.  The cops are going to come.  How loud was it?  It was so fucking loud.  I said turn it down.  I sat for a little while, and I'm like, this is really...  Like, I couldn't hear who I was talking to.  Yeah.  So I asked D-Rock, is the music loud, or am I just fucking...  Am I just being a fucking old lady?  He goes, no, it's loud.  And I asked Roland, he goes, yeah, it's really loud. 
[01:23:30]  And Roland said it was really loud, yeah.  Y-Rock, how loud was the music?  It was echoing off Ant's house back at you.  Oh, my God.  So his speakers were shooting towards the house.  If you're sitting in the middle, you got it at both ends.  Oh, more partying.  Wait, more Vine videos of the party.  But once again, you see the three hot girls.  Oh, well...  And nothing else.  So now there's Denny in the background.  Certainly not complaining, but I just don't...  I don't really get a feel for who else was there.  It was for Denny. 
[01:24:00]  I was getting Denny in frame there.  Oh, I see.  And when you say three hot girls, two of the three you're referring to are our interns.  Oh, yeah.  If they're hot, they're hot.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  I wanted to show, because they were having a great time.  Look, they're dancing to Denny's music and everything.  I just wanted to...  But you could have filmed Denny at any moment, but you decided to film him at the point where  the three girls were dancing right in front of them.  You've got to get the action in there and everything, you know?  But you wanted to show Denny was there.  Exactly.  I wanted to show Denny. 
[01:24:30]  I think that's him.  I can't really tell.  Yeah.  He's way in the back in the darkness.  Oh, there he is.  But the music was loud.  Do you do the move where you invite the neighbors so then they feel like they can't call the  cops because they were invited to the party, or you don't even invite them anymore?  No, I don't think I ever have.  You should invite them, knowing they'll never come over.  But then they won't pick up their phone and call, because then they feel like they were  part of the party.  Here's my fucking take.  Right, right.  Here's my take. 
[01:25:00]  That's why you do that.  My take is, look.  You warn them there's a party.  Hey, if you want to come over and have a burger, come on over.  It's summer.  And then they don't fucking pick up the phone and call the cops.  It's summer.  I have a few of these per year.  Saturday night.  They could go fuck themselves.  Do you think your neighbors hate you?  They fucking hate me.  We pulled up.  I pulled up with a friend of mine, and we could hear the music from a block away.  No.  And I'm like, they hate his guts out here.  I'm like, this is a nice Jewish neighborhood.  They're all doctors and attorneys. 
[01:25:30]  And nice, responsible people.  And then there's just this fucking well-lit Sodom and Gomorrah in the middle of the block.  Holy shit, really?  I know.  You could not not hear that music.  That was really loud.  You've got a really nice spot out there, but the houses are a little too close for what you do.  I had to weigh it out.  When you're in your house, you go in your backyard, you can't tell that the houses are close.  But when you're throwing a party, it's pretty obvious.  I know.  It was crazy. 
[01:26:00]  All right.  Oh, that's Pat from Monaki, right?  Where?  Well, over there.  Wait, is this another?  This is a different Vine video, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh.  That's a guest.  There's Pat.  Where?  Pool.  I blinked.  Pool.  I think I saw Sal for a second.  Wait, where's Pat?  And there's Pat.  Where?  Oh, I almost saw Sal.  Sal.  Hot girl dancing, hot girl dancing, hot girl dancing, hot girl dancing.  Pat.  Pat.  Pat.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:26:30]  See how that worked?  That's nice.  There's Denny in the background.  It's a Denny video.  Denny.  It's a Denny video.  Wait, what?  Look at the lights all over the place.  Denny brought his lights.  And his hard drive of hits.  Is he a good DJ?  Yes, of course.  Denny's great.  I would recommend him.  Did you have to pay him?  I threw him a few parts.  The money wasn't discussed, but at the end of the night, I tossed him some cash.  Greased him up a little bit.  I tossed him some cash.  Nice.  It was very successful.  Look at that.  It's just amazing. 
[01:27:00]  Well, there's a picture of, whoa.  Oh, okay.  What happened there?  Well, we had taken a picture.  I guess it was me.  Who was it?  Me, Jackie.  And then there was somebody else in the picture.  And then she was like, oh, let's get a picture together.  I'm like, oh, okay.  So, you know, we just had a nice little embrace and picture.  You're hugging her really tight.  What? 
[01:27:30]  That's an intern you've only known a week.  I haven't seen a lot of intern pictures like that.  No.  Who's the other guy?  Is the guy here today?  A lot of intern pictures.  We ought to get him in here because I'm sure he wants a picture with Anthony.  Should we recreate this photo?  I think we should, yes.  The guy intern.  Yes.  In 20 years, I think this is the only picture you took with an intern.  Weird.  It could be.  Very strange.  You don't even hug Opie.  No.  We've never touched in 19 plus years.  I figured it's time I pay attention to the intern. 
[01:28:00]  You know, there are interns that people say, remember intern like Bob?  And I'm like, who?  What?  I don't remember anything.  I figured I better start remembering the intern's names.  So, you know.  Now I know.  What's her name?  Jackie.  Oh, you know that one?  Yeah.  Oh.  Good.  And Sydney.  Wow.  That was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You usually have trouble with the intern's names.  I sure do.  Yeah.  So, Jimmy went and asked Danny to turn down the music.  Did he turn down the music?  A little bit. 
[01:28:30]  But I asked after I asked other people.  Not enough, right?  I'm like, it was fucking loud.  It was loud.  It was loud.  It was cranking loud.  But what time was it at that point?  It wasn't the hour.  It was probably 11.  Maybe 10, 30, 10.  Yeah.  But it wasn't the hour.  It was like I was just talking.  I was sitting at the table talking to Eric and Roland and Liza.  And I asked, is that?  And they all said, yeah, it is.  So I confirmed.  And I asked Anthony.  He said, yeah, it seems fucking loud.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So then he turned it down just slightly.  A smidge, yeah. 
[01:29:00]  A smidge.  Yeah.  Didn't make much of a difference to the neighbors, probably.  No.  No.  Not really.  Yeah.  I love it.  What time did the cops come?  Because I only stayed for like an hour.  Well.  Wow, we jumped ahead here.  That.  We were saving the cop thing, but.  Well, the cops.  The cops showed up.  Well, it was weird.  Because they didn't just show up, show up.  I was doing a live from the compound show.  Right.  We cranked up the compound cameras.  We had it on the karaoke stage.  Mm-hmm.  And then I decided, let's crank up the studio and just leave the door open and the mics on. 
[01:29:30]  And anyone that wants to go in could just sit down like a little confessional and have a show.  Nice.  And hold a show.  Oh, it's not posted.  Yeah.  It's not posted.  It was one of those live, you know, things and that's it.  Mm-hmm.  Um, so a bunch of people were going in and out and I decided I'm going to go in there  and, you know, have a little fun with some people.  So we're doing just that.  And then my phone rings.  My phone rings.  And I'm like, hello?  And I hear, uh, Anthony. 
[01:30:00]  It's, and then he tells me who he is.  And it involved of the Nassau County Police Department.  They know you personally?  He's got my number.  So I go, oh, hey, how you doing?  He goes, well, we'll be out in front of your house in a few minutes.  Got a little noise complaint.  I'm like, oh, God.  All right, we'll be right out.  It was me.  I called them.  You called the cops.  Jimmy couldn't take it anymore.  Jimmy called the cops on me.  I was trying to have a chat.  I couldn't.  Jimmy called the police on me.  Jimmy couldn't take it. 
[01:30:30]  All right, so they show up for a little noise complaint.  No big deal, right?  What time was this?  Um, this was much later.  Much later in the evening.  Um, I can't be sure of the time.  Two-ish.  I can't be sure of the time.  Not really sure of the time.  Yeah, yeah.  Um, but, uh, yeah, they, they, they, he called me.  Right.  I then went outside and noticed that the music had been shut off by that point anyway. 
[01:31:00]  So they were showing up, but it was already, you know.  Then he was already.  He was done.  Yeah.  He packed up his hard drive of hits.  Yeah, yeah.  And his obnoxious lights and got the hell out of there.  Yeah.  So two cars pull up.  Yeah.  You know, a couple of guys get out.  Yeah.  We're just, you know, and I, I had known, I knew that, you know, one of the guys, and  then I met the other guy, and we were talking for quite a while.  Mikey, you know, NYPD Mikey came out.  We were just talking.  We were talking about, like, all kinds of shit.  But, and then that, that at this point is when Steve from Bayshore, uh, comes staggering 
[01:31:30]  out my front door.  Now, I'm, there's two in Nassau County.  There's me and Mikey Cuffs.  There's a picture of Steve from Bayshore.  He's hammered.  Wow.  He looks hammered in that picture.  Hammered.  Wow.  Hammered.  So he, um, he staggers out the house.  Right.  And, and he's doing that thing where he puts one foot forward, leans back. 
[01:32:00]  Right.  And then he's walking.  And, and we're, we're all looking at him now.  The cops start kind of chuckling like that.  And then I, I hear jingle, jingle, and I see him pull his keys out of his pocket.  I'm not kidding.  Holy shit.  No way.  He pulls his keys out of his pocket and he's walking toward the street.  So I just, I start laughing.  I'm like, like, ah, I go, Steve, if you're thinking of going somewhere, I go, it's probably 
[01:32:30]  a real bad idea.  Right.  At this point, he doesn't even acknowledge, he can't hear anything.  He can't see anything.  How close were, did he walk by you guys?  Directly.  We were on my grass.  And obvious cops, they weren't.  Yes.  There were two Nassau County cop cars.  Right, right.  Two cops.  Oh my God.  And him staggering toward the street.  Walking right by all this.  With his keys out.  Oh my God.  It only gets better because.  If he's up, he's got to call the show.  As he continued walking.  Yeah.  Oh, he'll be no help with this because he doesn't remember anything. 
[01:33:00]  Wow.  Wow.  As he's walking with his keys out, he then stops to put his key in the lock of the car door.  This was after you told him this is not a good idea.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  But he's putting the key into the lock of the passenger side of one of the Nassau County  cop cars.  No way.  No way.  Yes fucking way.  Oh.  We're stunned now. 
[01:33:30]  We're just sitting there.  He's rocking back and forth, trying to fucking put the key in the Nassau County cop car.  Oh my God.  We're roaring laughing at this point.  It's like, Steve, what are you doing?  And then he goes like, and then staggers across the street to his vehicle where he goes to  the passenger side, unlocks the door, gets in the passenger side and shuts the door.  Now he's sitting in his passenger seat and now we're just laughing. 
[01:34:00]  So we continue talking for a little while, the cops, and we're obviously keeping an eye  that he's not trying to drive anywhere.  Uh, so he, uh, we, we go, we, we better, me and Mikey go, we better take care of, you  know, Steve, make sure he's all right and everything.  So we go over with the cops, the cops take the flashlight, put it through the window.  Steve just kind of looks at like, what?  Oh, wow.  Something completely unintelligible.  Uh, we opened the door to get him out at which point, um, Steve, uh, pretty much does 
[01:34:30]  the old Grauman's Chinese theater, cement footprint things in his own vomit outside the, uh,  the vehicle.  When he puked right outside the car?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he was puking outside the car and he stepped in, um, he stepped in the, uh, the puke.  Uh, yes.  So, so we had him go on the, you know, the grass and everything and kind of wipe his foot  off and, and clean it up.  And then we got him inside into one of the bedrooms and, uh, put a little puke pail next 
[01:35:00]  to the bed and that's where Steve from Bayshore slept it off until the next morning where  he left a nice note on a paper plate and, uh, and took off.  Did he puke on the, uh, no, no, he didn't.  He didn't.  He was, he was good.  He was done with that.  But when, when he tried to open the cop's car door, drunk off his ass, I was fucking laughing  my balls off.  The worst is yet to come.  More of the Opie and Anthony worst of the week countdown.

[01:40:00]  That's now.homeadvisor.com.  The Worst of the Week Countdown continues.  Inching our way to the top of the Worst of the Week Countdown.  This is the Worst of the Week Countdown with me, Sam Roberts, from the Opie and Anthony Show.  And after Opie and Anthony Live, we'll get to Ozzy.  Actually, we're going to get to Ozzy Osbourne right now.  We're going to get to Seth Rogen in a minute.  We're going to get to Scott Thorson, the real-life Liberace boyfriend, in a minute. 
[01:40:30]  But Ozzy is what we're talking about right now.  Ozzy Osbourne and Geezer Butler were in studio this week.  You had to know that little Jimmy Norton was freaking out.  Nobody is a bigger Black Sabbath fan than Jim Norton.  And I don't think there's any guest that holds a candle to Ozzy, except maybe Ozzy with Geezer.  Listen to Jim in all of his glory as Ozzy and Geezer are in studio. 
[01:41:00]  How you doing, Ozzy?  Take a seat, my friend.  Hey, guys.  What's up, man?  How you doing, man?  Take a seat.  How are you?  You lost so much weight.  Yeah, Jimmy lost a lot of weight.  Just going to the gym.  Just going to the gym and eating better.  That's it.  What did you cut out?  I just cut out eating late at night and just awful food that I was eating.  And on the road, it's hard.  Because I eat a lot of crap on the road.  So we're on right now.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Pop the old headphones on.  Talk about the new album. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, my God.  You're doing really well around the world.  Yeah, you tweeted yesterday that it was number one in Germany, right?  Yes.  And now today it's number one in USA, USA, UK, Greece, everywhere.  Oh, really?  So you guys are obviously really...  On iTunes.  So you're really thrilled with the fact that it's doing well.  Oh, absolutely.  Were you surprised by how it sounded when you guys...  When you finished with it, how did you finally hear the finished product?  Well, I'd get the mixes every day when we were doing it, we'd take a rough mix at home. 
[01:42:00]  So that was all I was used to.  And I was kind of like, I was kind of thinking, well, it's okay, I suppose.  But then when I heard the finished master, it blew me away.  It was so much, so good, well done.  Did you think it was going to do this well this fast?  No, not at all.  I mean, when you're in the middle of it, you don't realize how, you know, what you're doing.  You just do it naturally.  But I mean, if it's number one now around the world, it's the first number one we ever had, both solo and together. 
[01:42:30]  Well, the fact is, too, it's also the fact that you're doing with iTunes and you did CSI and you're doing all of this kind of like mainstream stuff.  That's a treatment that Sabbath never got.  Well, it's kind of weird when we were together.  We never had one good review of anything, but anybody said we were going to last.  But all of a sudden people are going, you know, they're saying positive things, which I don't really feel comfortable with because we were always a people's band, you know.  But now it's what you've got to do because there's no records anymore and, you know, you've got to do the, you've got to be on chat lines and whatever. 
[01:43:00]  Well, this sounds like, like old Sabbath.  This, you definitely went back.  Rick Riven had a plan.  He was, you know, it's stopping on with the, as you say, which Sabbath do we get together again?  And if they do, I want to be the producer.  Yeah, and it took us back to the first album.  And after, I'm going, I'm going, why is she going to the first album more than like 19 albums each?  Wow.  So you've got to go back and kind of unlearn all the stuff you've learned in the 35 years. 
[01:43:30]  And it's like, lyrically, the album is brilliant.  And I know, Geezer, you're responsible for a lot of that.  Is it kind of hard to address stuff that you addressed when you were 20 or 25 and address it now in kind of the same vein or with the same emotion?  No, because it's different.  It's, um, same, there's still some old crap going on in the world.  So, you know, there's still loads of things that you can sing about.  Well, pedophilia you address in the Catholic Church scandal, which I thought you guys addressed really nicely and pretty aggressively. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, I mean, Ozzy came up with the line, dear father.  And at first it was the quote from Jesus, they know not what they do.  So I didn't want to use that since Jesus had already said it.  Yeah, probably if it's been quoted a few times, you don't want to rip them off.  So I thought, well, what could I do, dear father, I didn't want to do it about your dad or anything.  So I just thought, well, father, Catholic priest. 
[01:44:30]  And that was all going on at the time when I was writing the lyrics.  And so I thought, since they've been having a go at us since we started, let's have a go back at them.  Oh, yeah.  I guess it's got to feel good after all these years of hearing them criticize what you do and what you stand for.  Like, you know, look what was going on.  Yeah, because they never really listened to the lyrics anyway of Sabbath.  And they've always condemned metal, any metal thing, saying satanic and all that crap. 
[01:45:00]  And meanwhile, they're fiddling about it, little kids, you know.  So it was our turn to show the real hypocrites and the real evil people are in the world.  And how is Tony?  I mean, I know he's, you know, he's resting up in England and getting ready to tour.  Is he doing okay?  Yeah, he's doing great.  He's responding well to his treatment.  And is the tour going to happen as scheduled?  Do you guys still think you're going to be going out and doing?  Hopefully.  I mean, it's like we contact him on a regular basis. 
[01:45:30]  He sounds great when I text him on that.  What was the schedule like when you were recording?  Because, again, he's going through chemo and treatments and he's doing an album.  So how did you balance that?  We were doing like about four or five weeks on and then he'd have his treatment and have to rest for about a month and then go back in and do it again, which is the same thing that we're doing for the tour.  Yeah, he'll be touring for about six to eight weeks at a time and then he goes back and has his treatment. 
[01:46:00]  And you're uncomfortable with almost the positive press and with the good reviews and the stuff like that?  It's kind of difficult to get used to there, right?  I haven't really read any reviews yet, so.  Well, I mean, Rolling Stone is being nice about it and then it's like all these outlets that typically didn't give you guys what you deserved are now being nice.  Well, I suppose you start, you know, when they slugged us, they didn't think we were going to last. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, you were around long enough.  They're like, all right, we love these guys.  It's kind of like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know how to take it because it's like when the media and that start liking us, I think, oh, well, they can miss just the first time around.  But then again, I was just talking to Howard Stern and in 1968, we had no idea it was going to land in the last five years, I don't mind, 45 years. 
[01:47:00]  It's unbelievable.  The last studio album was 35 years ago.  Last studio album that long ago.  Yeah, what was the, because I don't remember that.  Like I was, you know, I became a Sabbath fan when I was about 12 or 13 and, you know, that was 1980 or 81.  So this is the first time I've ever experienced this and the anticipation for this album, it was like, there's no way it could have lived up to what I wanted.  And I really mean it.  It's fucking so much better than I had hoped it would be.  I can't believe how fucking much I love this record. 
[01:47:30]  I mean, I hope you guys understand how great it is.  You're gushing.  You're just looking at each other.  You're gushing, Jimmy.  I'm just being a gushing, sissy fanboy.  Who are you going to blow first?  Holy shit.  Well, geezer just volunteered Ozzy, so I guess Ozzy.  Well, what was the question?  I really wasn't.  I was just saying I kind of hope you guys...  No question there.  No question.  That was a rhetorical ass-kissing you just got.  I was just basically saying...  Do you know how good the record is? 
[01:48:00]  Because when you're close to something...  When you're doing it, you don't realize, you know, you like it, you love it, but then we're not used to having all this attention, you know.  We just bought albums that go on the road, you know.  Well, the CSI thing was interesting, too, because that's such a mainstream show, and it's very rare that I ever got to see my band on a show like that, you know, because I love you guys and I love Kiss, and there was never that mainstream treatment in the 70s.  But there's no outlet anymore, there's no music television, there's no MTV, there's just a fucking channel with games and things, there's no... 
[01:48:30]  Unless you watch That Metal Show on VH1, which is like 4 o'clock in the morning or something.  So do you think that...  So records aren't making what they used to make?  I mean, obviously, the money mostly comes from touring as opposed to the albums.  I don't really ask my wife that question.  I don't know.  Because they're saying, like, a lot of bands complain that they can't make money doing the albums anymore.  Well, it's like, they're downloaded for free, and pretty soon it's going to be... 
[01:49:00]  You can't make anything, it's going to cost you money to make records.  Has the technology and stuff and iTunes and the availability and grabbing one song here and one song there helped you guys or hurt you guys, do you think?  Do you think it's exposed you to more people, or has it hurt you?  I think it's instant now.  It's like I was saying last night, you can look up iTunes now, and I was just looking to see what new stuff was coming out this week,  and I noticed that the Sabbath album was number one, so it's like, oh, God, you know, you forget that it's that instant. 
[01:49:30]  So I understand that the people want it, want something, but they want it now, and everything's instant now,  so that it's like having to go down to your record shop, which is gone.  But there's something sad about that, because when you used to do vinyl albums, you'd have a great artwork on the albums.  Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's something to read, and you're kind of excited for anything to release that.  Something to clean your weed on.  Yeah, yeah.  You can find missiles. 
[01:50:00]  You can wing it across the road.  There's a little bit of everything with those album covers.  You can find your pizza box.  Something to shoot at.  But that is, you do miss that.  It's like, it's the smell of a new record, and the big booklets that would come with them, and all that stuff now.  It's just like a little digital picture, and it's not quite the same.  And the vinyl things become a collector's only kind of a thing.  Yeah.  Also, journeying outside the house.  You have to go to the store.  You can stay in your house, and you have everything delivered. 
[01:50:30]  You don't have to leave ever.  It's amazing.  I like that idea a bit.  I kind of like that part myself, too.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't go out much.  Well, I think that's what the fucking Netflix, I mean, Netflix, other than...  Yeah, yeah.  You just pop it.  Everything really instantly available right there to your house.  I was walking...  Do you not think we're all moving too fast, though?  It is a little bit.  There are times where you should probably go out, maybe meet people face-to-face.  Get some air. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, get a little air.  Something.  I don't know.  It just seems like now...  We were talking about, like, Facebook and Twitter and how you meet people, and especially  relationships with girls and things like that when you want to go out.  You used to have to look a girl in the face and ask her, you know, hey, you want to go  out or you want to do that.  Now, you wind up seeing each other's fucking pussy and tits and dick and everything else  before you go out.  Give me that.  I want to have a look at that one.  Pussy and tits and dick.  That's one girl.  That has to be with more chicks. 
[01:51:30]  Jesus.  It's just that the whole...  The dance has been just compressed into this tiny...  So you can lie also.  You can also lie on these movies.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  I'm 21 and she's fucking 85 years old.  People do that, too.  They send out photos that aren't them.  Yeah, yeah.  I know, because I do it.  Yes, of course you do, Jeremy.  I receive them.  I don't know. 
[01:52:00]  It's just...  I don't think it's better or worse in any way.  I just think it's different.  You know, history will...  It's fucking easy if you wake up next to an 85-year-old.  History will always...  You know, things will change over time.  I mean, this is just something else.  Yeah, I'm a sperm bank on the...  Yeah.  I can't see them as if my fingers are so sticky.  Who are you talking to there? 
[01:52:30]  Sticky fingers.  It's weird.  I've gone through entire relationships on the phone.  Like, just text messaging and pictures.  And then you never wind up meeting the person.  It's really weird how you get...  You don't have to go out and talk to people anymore.  There's a beginning, a middle, and an end of this pseudo-relationship.  And you never meet.  It's the oddest thing.  And then after a while you realize,  Oh, I haven't even fucking, like, messaged them in weeks.  Oh, I guess that's over.  It's like, what over?  It never was.  It's an odd thing.  It really is.  You know what's that thing on the TV when they set people up? 
[01:53:00]  And they go...  They've got a sex thing.  And a guy comes, you know who I am.  Oh, would they have you go to the house and he shows up?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Have I seen it?  I've been on it.  Yes, of course.  But it's pretty weird, you know.  Yeah.  There was one guy, when he took all his clothes off,  and the guy goes, he's sitting there naked.  He goes, well, what do you do?  He says, I'm a rabbi.  Yeah, yeah, that was...  To Catch a Predator.  To Catch a Predator.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like the craziest show ever. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  We actually...  There was a guy there, and he said to...  What was his name?  Chris Hansen.  Chris Hansen.  He goes, oh, yeah, I saw you on the Opie and Anthony show.  I go, great.  There's one of ours.  They got one of our fans.  One of our fans getting cuffed out on the lawn, crying, trying not to look into the camera.  That was a highlight for us, huh?  It certainly was.  Hey, better him than me.  Do you get concerned with privacy and stuff like that?  Because now, everything is savable, like with digital technology.  Every text you save, every message, it's all savable. 
[01:54:00]  Every movie you make.  And it's like, you know, I don't know how I feel about that, whether it's good or bad,  but...  Well, regardless how you feel, it's happening.  It absolutely is.  If the government's been watching me...  To be honest, I don't know how to work a computer very well.  Yeah?  Two things about it.  You're not...  But I can't remember that.  My son sits down and says, if you want to get this, press this button.  I'm still pressing fucking buttons and nothing happens.  Trying to find something?  I'm going to press a button.  The screen fucking wipes out.  You must be a wizard. 
[01:54:30]  I'll get that curly thing.  Yeah, that's it.  The thing that says it's doing something.  It's doing something.  It's working!  It's working?  I've had 15 years and he's fucking working.  Hey, how's Jack doing?  He's doing great.  He's doing great.  He's doing absolutely great.  We love him, man.  He's a good guy.  He's only done our show once, but he's a solid human being.  He's very cool.  It's something we kind of like grew up.  We watched your kids grow up on television.  Wow.  I mean, Jack's just giving us her daughter, Pearl.  She's crazy. 
[01:55:00]  It seemed like yesterday it was in a field in my house.  He's a little kid on the show.  Are you a good grandfather?  You a good grandfather, Oz?  I love her.  She's wonderful.  I've got grandchildren from other kids.  Oh, that's true.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  93.  I was a little off on that one.  Yeah, just a couple of years.  I was off a couple of decades.  No, I do not.  I've been a busy boy.  Sorry.  You certainly have.  I guess the new one I should have said.  You know, I was just sharing the other day.  I was just sharing the channel.  Would you like to have another kid? 
[01:55:30]  She goes, no fucking thing.  You're done.  No more.  Oh, we're done.  We're done.  A long time ago.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't doubt it.  Wow.  Do you ever, because you're more private, like you see Ozzy's life has been so public for  all these years.  Did that kind of make you want to be more public?  No, no, no, no.  Wow, that was definitive.  I'm not the least public person on earth.  I don't use the phone.  I don't use anything.  Oh, really?  I go home and that's it.  You never see me. 
[01:56:00]  That's it, huh?  You're not online or anything either?  I'm online, but only about three people know the rest.  Yeah, so you don't, you're not a big guy, you know, you don't enjoy like the Twitter or  the texting or anything.  You kind of just keep it to them.  No, I have people to do that.  Yeah.  I sent you an email, actually.  I thought it was you.  Yeah, but Hasselhoff.  No.  Jimmy's like, no, that's not me.  No, we all, because we all took, last time I saw you guys, like two weeks ago, we all  took a picture and you said to your assistant, you never send me the pictures to your assistant. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She sent it to me.  Oh, thank God.  Okay.  Because I should have just lied to you.  She sent it to me, you twat.  That sounds like an instant delete.  Fucking Jim Norton.  Yeah.  Like, who is this, who is this creep between, I wanted a picture of me and Ozzy, not this  fucking troll.  I'm just ruining the photo.  Do you guys watch that metal show?  Do you watch that?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, shit. 
[01:57:00]  Here goes Eddie Trunk.  Here goes Eddie Trunk.  Oh, yeah.  I'm a quarantine.  I feel like I'm a quarantine.  Come on, man.  So, what happens?  I'm seeing you guys tonight at the town hall.  We're doing that thing down in.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  And we're talking to a large audience.  And we have Tony will be on remote and Brad Wilkes and Jack.  And Brad was a great choice for drums.  And I know you guys had to pick somebody.  You can't have an album without a drummer.  And what was the final point that said, this is the guy for us, as opposed to other guys 
[01:57:30]  that you've been working with?  That we had two weeks to go in the studio and record.  And we didn't have anybody.  So, Rick, it was Rick's idea to bring in Brad.  We tried a few other drummers and it didn't work out.  And Rick just said, try Brad.  He's going to work out.  And we tried him.  We did about two weeks rehearsals with him.  And after about a week, everything fell into place. 
[01:58:00]  And we went, yeah, this is the right choice.  Was there a time where you thought he might not be the guy?  Like, was there a time where it was...  Well, the first few days, it was, like, really strange.  Especially after being with Bill for hundreds of years.  Right.  And it was just weird playing with a different drummer that you've never played with before.  And then, but...  Yeah, originally it was going to be Tommy, but Rick didn't want to use Tommy.  Rick Rubin gave him a few pointers.  And Brad sort of got it. 
[01:58:30]  And we got into the groove of everything that we were doing.  And it went from there.  It turned out really well.  Yeah, it seems...  Like, to go back...  And I was amazed you were able to grab...  Like, anyone who's an old Sabbath fan will love this.  Because I was amazed you were able to get that sound...  Like, legitimately get the sound of, like, the first couple of albums.  I was recruiting.  I was recruiting with Hal Ben.  I didn't know what he was talking about for the last time.  Probably likewise, I think.  From the first album. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  We kept doing...  Man, let's listen to the first album.  And it was like, what the fuck's the sound of it?  And then it kind of clicked.  Because we were originally, we were a jazz blues band.  Mm-hmm.  And we'd be doing the songs on the first album live.  So it was like a bit of an overflow from the blues stuff.  The feel he was looking for.  To be able to listen to old tracks like that  and know what needs to be put on the guitar,  what needs to be put on the bass and whatnot  to get that old sound is really... 
[01:59:30]  That's a talent, man.  That's recruiting for years.  Yeah, yeah.  Every time I'd run into him, he would say,  if you do a Sabbath album, count me in.  I want to produce.  So he said...  It didn't come straight and fresh.  He'd been working in his mind.  Right, right.  So he knew.  You know, it was very interesting.  It sounds like old Sabbath,  but it doesn't sound dated at all.  Yeah.  That's a talent to be able to do something like that.  But it basically got us back to playing live in the studio  instead of putting tons of overdubs and keyboards 
[02:00:00]  and effects and everything else on.  Yeah.  That we got into this habit in the late 70s  of just layering everything,  just going over the top in the studio  because we were producing ourselves.  and the more dope we were doing,  the more stuff we were doing.  The more tracks.  Wait, were you guys doing drugs in the 70s?  No.  Everything.  No, no, no.  We're going to church.  Oh, jeez. 
[02:00:30]  And Tylenol.  Yeah, that's about it.  Andrew was good there, wasn't he?  Well, there's a documentary that's being shown tonight,  a 25-minute documentary,  and you said something interesting about back in those,  like, you know,  a lot of times you have to sing the chorus more than once.  And back in those days,  or for a while,  you'd sing it once,  and then they would just,  the computer would bounce it off something.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And now you wanted to sing these.  Yeah, yeah.  I sang it exactly the way I used to do in the old days.  Which was kind of just to blow it right through.  Just go through it, you know.  And did you like this more, 
[02:01:00]  having done it,  this process,  or did you kind of go like,  wow, we missed the computers,  or fuck, we've been missing out?  No, we never,  on our first album,  it was two four-trick machines bounce under each other,  if you don't know what I'm talking about.  And once you bounce it down,  you couldn't take it back,  so you kind of mix as you're going along,  you know.  And it was just,  we just,  because we just went in,  plug in,  played,  and that was,  that's the way we thought people make records.  Why did bands stop doing that?  Because every time there's a classic record,  you always hear like,  these amazing albums,  oh, we did that in four hours, 
[02:01:30]  like all these great works that were done,  and then for some reason,  people fell into the computer trap,  and overproduced.  Yeah.  A lot of it's having your home computers,  because you can do anything on your laptop.  As many tracks as you need.  Yeah.  And then they go into the studio,  and that's the thing,  that's the way you're supposed to do it.  You had to play it live,  accurately in the studio,  because you only had a limited number of tracks on the tape.  And once you bounced it down,  though,  now,  if you bounce down your bass and guitar track 
[02:02:00]  onto a single track,  now you can't alter the difference  between the bass and the guitar.  So you have to keep building,  and building,  and building.  So you've got to play pretty accurately together,  as opposed to if you've got a zillion tracks,  now you just bam, bam, bam,  mix it later.  Fix it in the mix, motherfucker.  Exactly.  We'll fix it in the mix.  But then that process got meticulous.  Yeah,  then it got overproduced.  Right.  And then they would take a year  to fucking mix an album.  Yep.  Holy mackerel.  But this time,  we did it, 
[02:02:30]  we got back to playing it live in the studio,  and if one of us made a big mistake,  we'd have to stop and start from the top again.  Start over again.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So we all had to really concentrate,  and we sort of knew the songs backwards by then.  A little more pressure.  And you're vocally doubling yourself,  like you're singing on top of yourself again,  instead of just taking one track,  doubling.  I'm still doing the whole thing.  So you're singing.  I like that,  because it gives these slight differences in the voice, 
[02:03:00]  and makes it almost like,  like oscillate a little between the notes.  You've been in a recording studio.  Yeah,  a couple of times.  Yeah,  a few times.  He was in a band.  It's such a fuller,  it's a fuller sound when you do it like that.  It's not,  and that's like the classic,  you know,  Ozzy sound too.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Sometimes a flaw is okay.  Like,  there's one part in Damaged Soul,  where it's like in one of,  which I know I'm kind of going deep for anyone who hasn't heard the album,  but there's,  it's such a fucking heavy song, 
[02:03:30]  and there's one point where you say soul,  and your voice cracks a little bit,  and they left,  like,  they left that imperfection.  Yeah,  yeah,  I like that.  I've always liked the fact that you can hear people,  people's fingers going up the fretboard.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  It makes it sound like,  but now it's like fucking pure sound.  Yeah.  It's not supposed to sound like that.  It doesn't sound like that.  Yeah,  yeah.  I've been in the studio doing an album,  and I,  I sang it one,  not on this last album,  but one of my albums,  and I got this track home to my house,  and I'm playing it, 
[02:04:00]  and I go,  I never fucking sang it like that.  And I found the producer,  and I said,  Michael,  can I ask you a question?  Is it possible to tune the voice differently?  He goes,  oh,  yeah.  Oh,  did you do that?  Oh,  shit.  Oh,  yeah.  I said,  you fucking asshole.  I mean,  that can make it sound different,  you know?  Yeah,  it's not me.  Yeah,  yeah.  Oh,  wow.  So it irritated you.  If I'd have wanted to sing it that way,  I'd have sang it that way,  he'd just alter the melody. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah,  they could alter the pitch,  and then they gate out any ambient sound that was in there.  This was the beginning of a pro tour.  I don't even know what pro tour was.  Pro tour.  We were just both fucking around in a pro tour.  Yeah,  yeah.  So did you at one point get caught up in that,  like just recording in different studio,  not with each other,  but I mean,  as the years went on,  did you kind of fall into that?  I've never really got into that kind of thing,  because it's not the way we started,  but a lot of producers do,  and I think that's the way you do it.  That's why Rick was so good, 
[02:05:00]  because he took us back as if it was an analogue recording.  Right,  yeah.  And the days of the drugs and all that stuff.  Tony said in an interview recently,  I think with BBC,  that you would have them flown in on a private plane.  Yeah.  Wow.  I didn't get in there.  I was the one to pitch it up.  I went down Monday to get a cusp on the plane,  couldn't get back till Friday.  That's probably a bad idea.  Send Ozzy for the drugs,  not bring him back.  I'm still fucking out there now.

Jim,  did you know that right now,  some retail banks around the country  are allowing people to exchange ordinary paper dollars  for real holding your hand silver?  What?

I'm Sam Roberts  from the Opie and Anthony show  and after  Opie and Anthony live  my show  The Sam Roberts show  is on at 4 p.m. Eastern 
[02:10:00]  on Sunday  Cedric the Entertainer  is on the show  this week  but that doesn't hold  a candle  to what happened  on Opie and Anthony  this week.  We'll get to Scott Thorson  the real life  Liberace boyfriend  from the movie  in a minute  but first  let's talk about  Seth Rogen  Seth Rogen was in studio  he's all over  the movies this week  you've seen him  Knocked Up  and Superbad  and Pineapple Express  and if you're cool  Freaks and Geeks  well now he's in a movie 
[02:10:30]  called This is the End  which is killing it  which is killing it  thanks in some part  I would imagine  to his appearance  this week  on the Opie and Anthony show  Seth Rogen  here he is  I saw This is the End  man  fuck man  loved it  thank you so much  man  loved it  I really appreciate that  and I haven't loved  a comedy in a while  it's been a couple  years now  it's tough  to make a good  very tough  to make a good  comedy  why do you think  it's tough  I think it's tough  to let them 
[02:11:00]  leave you alone  honestly  like that's what  I found  is the most tough  is to resist  like you know  money  honestly  like you have to  like make movies  for like cheaper  than you can make them  for  is like what's a little  counterintuitive  like we probably could  make more expensive movies  but we don't  because we get to make  fucking crazy movies  if we make cheaper movies  so like you literally  get paid less  you have less time  to make them  like and it's  taken me years  to realize that  that's better 
[02:11:30]  but it is better  and I think  that's why  that's why  we've found it hard  like every movie  we've made  that isn't as good  as the good  or you know  the better movies  we've made  is because of  the rating  or the budget  or just something  that kind of  ultimately disqualifies  it from being like  batshit fucking crazy  which is what you  want to be able  to do  is like any idea  you come up with  on set  you want to be like  let's do that  let's do that  and you don't ever  want to be like  I don't think  we can do that  well with that said 
[02:12:00]  there's so many  cameos in this movie  and the one thing  I was thinking  as I'm sitting there  like man  Seth's got to pay  all these people  we didn't pay  any of them shit  but how do you  I mean  how do you get them  all to agree  to do their cameos  you call it a lot  of favors  and just say please  wow  you just say please  and you hope  you know I do stuff  that people ask me  if I think it's funny  like if you're  again if like  there's so few  actually funny things  out there  that if there's  something that you  feel like might be  funny then you  just do it 
[02:12:30]  you want to do  a vine with me  yeah exactly  that's about the  amount of time  I commit to this  but I can only  commit to the  first two seconds  I'll do the  first cut of the  vine  but yeah I mean  it's just fun  people want to do  funny shit  like it's fun for  them as you know  people who like to  be funny to do  funny shit  so it wasn't that  hard to get people  how do you explain  the movie in your  words there  how do I explain  the plot of the movie  it's hard but we  say I guess it's  about a bunch of 
[02:13:00]  famous people that  are having a party  at James Franco's  house and then the  apocalypse happens and  a lot of them die and  the survivors barricade  themselves in the house  and kind of have to  deal with each other's  like underlying like  issues with each other  and like their past  their friendships and  their as they ride out  the apocalypse as they  ride out the end of the  world when you pick up  jay at the airport and  go back to your place  yeah I'm like alright  I'm in  that whole sequence  I'm like okay this  is gonna be a really  fucking good movie  thank you  and it's tough to talk 
[02:13:30]  about a movie I've seen  that other people  haven't seen  you don't want to  give away shit  yeah it's true  but one thing you'll  like and I actually  thought about this as  we use war pigs in  the movie  and we kind of like  cut it in a like  we kind of use it a  score almost like we  use the riff over and  over again and in  order to do that  Ozzy Osbourne had to  clear it so he  actually came himself  with Sharon to our  offices and watched  the entire movie by  himself and he  fucking loved it and  he cleared us the  song for the movie  and also over the 
[02:14:00]  end credits there's a  new Sabbath song from  his new album oh  wow like literally  kicks in like right  when the movie ends  do you mean this  I do mean that  album but what was  great is we got to  listen to the whole  album like in  December because we  got to pick which  song we wanted at the  end and it was  amazing  great it's so good  put it this way so  good it's so good that  it made Jimmy pop into  a British accent when  Ozzy was here yesterday  he was here yesterday  it's so  you talked to him in 
[02:14:30]  a British accent  we got to play  Ozzy and Deezer came  in yesterday and I  don't know what  happened  Jimmy's such a fanboy  he literally like you  know if you're hanging  out with people long  enough you kind of take  on some of their  speech patterns  the first time I had  a good friend from  New York I like  couldn't help it  you just start talking  like this a little  bit a little bit  here and there  Jimmy instantly became  like I don't British  or Irish or Scottish  I'm not even sure  what he was  he became James  Norton  I became the other  Jim Norton  the actor 
[02:15:00]  the English gentleman  there's an old  British Jim Norton  the actor  yeah he was sitting  here yesterday  I have to confess  when Seth walked in  I laughed like him  did you  yes go back to the  tape later  we are great like  that  I don't know why  but  your laugh is  listen to  yeah this is from  yesterday  it's a quick clip  they're coming in  to be interviewed  and the part where  he talks about  how he's losing weight  Ozzy goes wow  you lost a lot of  weight and then  Jim tells him  how he's losing  weight  listen to this 
[02:15:30]  put on  fucking  douchey  British accent  or you could just  say just a boy  talking to Ozzy  douche  Ozzy Osbourne  how you doing Ozzy  take a seat  my friend  what's up man  take a seat  how are you  yeah Jimmy lost  a lot of weight  just go to the gym  just go to the gym  just go to the gym  just go to the gym  he's more the cadence 
[02:16:00]  he took the cocky cadence  he did  but there's another one  right after that too  you gotta hear  cause he does that  just go to the gym  he goes  try to itch  itch  itch better  it's terrible  here it is  yeah Jimmy lost  a lot of weight  just go to the gym  just go to the gym  and eating better  I'm so douched  out like that  but I do  thank god  I came right back  you did  you bounced back  did you know it  as it was happening  yeah I felt  something was wrong 
[02:16:30]  yeah  I think I realized  I switched histories  and content  I'm like oh  you've just become  another human  yeah I don't know  what happened  I just got caught up  in it  cause they're so British  I do something  almost equally embarrassing  around musicians  which is  I'll start singing  their songs  without realizing it  oh shit  and I do it a lot  that's embarrassing  it is super fucking  embarrassing  like if Ozzy was here  I would just start  being like 
[02:17:00]  I'd like have to  catch myself  I'm like oh shit  I'm fucking singing  this asshole song  to me and be like  oh I know that song  I wrote that one  yeah great  I wrote that fucking song  good for you  what the fuck  yeah  you know it  what the fuck  you know what  people seem to really like  when serious actors  or actors that aren't  really known for comedy  are funny  in a movie  yes they do  and cameos like that  are fantastic  it doesn't happen  that often  when you get 
[02:17:30]  a serious actor  yeah yeah  but every once in a while  you have a James Franco  or someone like that  who actually  can do both  and was everyone  really cool  with like  goofing on themselves  or was there  something that you wrote  and they're like  dude come on man  there was nothing  like career wise  they wouldn't say  every once in a while  we would hit a wall  with people  that we maybe  wouldn't hit  if they weren't  playing themselves  we asked Jonah  to say he would like  suck God's dick  if you like  and he was like 
[02:18:00]  I don't know  and there was  some crank  like Mother Teresa  is like a piece  of shit  and he was like  I don't know  if I want to do that  I think one of the  he's like  please don't make me  say that  no it was great  and he's only on  for a little bit  I think people know  by now  Michael Cera  oh yeah  how you spun that  because we've kind of  made fun of him  a little bit  how he's been  playing the same guy  a little bit  oh we love him  but you fucking  hit it out of the park  with that  yeah he was 
[02:18:30]  I can't believe  he did it  he plays like  a coked out  sexual  I didn't know  if you wanted to say  some of the material  yeah it's crazy  yeah and we wrote  that like  it's fucking nuts  like we wrote it  and we sent it to him  and we were like  there's no way he'll do it  and we literally  got back an email  just being like  okay  and then we didn't have  like one other conversation  with him about it  yeah  whatever you need  yeah it's just like  whatever you're like  you're getting your ass  to eat in this scene  okay whatever  that's the scene  he's in the bathroom 
[02:19:00]  it's fantastic  and he's doing  Coco and Rihanna  yeah  it was pretty good  to look at  unbelievable  that's fantastic  and the other thing  when Danny McBride  shows up in the movie  he's a fuck  I said it  he's a fucking pimp  yeah he's unbelievable  he's un-fucking-believable  McBride's like  the funniest guy ever  like when he's on  there's nobody  fucking funnier  than that guy  it's crazy  like he kills all of us  and he's so like  ruthless  like he really  like he came to the set  like he came to filming  like a few weeks  after we'd been filming 
[02:19:30]  and I just kept emailing him  being like  we're really going at each other  pretty hard in here  so like  we're in your game  and he just like  decimated everybody  like it was  that James Franklin  suck any dick  he was just like  calling  like everyone  was just like  holy shit  this is insane  did you guys have  room to just improv  yeah a lot of it  it seems like it  yeah especially  when you're ourselves  you want to  you know  like really give  the guys freedom  to it  and you hang out  with each other  not on a regular basis  but that's kind of  the group of friends  really 
[02:20:00]  yeah I mean like  I have like  probably a closer  group of friends  that I see more  regularly  but people like  like uh  like Jay Barrett  Craig Robinson  I actually see a lot  McBride I see a lot  Franco I see quite a bit  like all these guys  were like  like invited to  or at my wedding  and like  sure  like I  and I  and I at theirs  like we  we're actually  really good friends  so it's nice  to work with them  you got a name  for your group of people  exactly  like the Bratz Pack  I'm so glad  we don't have  one of those  comedy group names 
[02:20:30]  I call mine  the fighting Irish  yes of course you do  and then you sound  Scottish  the pikes  the commitments  the commitments  nice  nice  ah shit  very well received  the movie  it's getting  good reviews  which is ridiculous  and for a cock  there's a lot of  giant cocks  in the movie  might be the best  reviewed movie  with giant cocks  with giant cocks  I think that's the  tagline from  Rolling Stone  exactly  oh that's cool 
[02:21:00]  the monsters are great  the fucking  the special effects  yeah no skimping  on the CGI  you got some zombie  stuff in there  you got a little  of everything  we got a little  of everything  I think you're  going to do alright  with this one Seth  I think it's going  to do okay  I mean we made  it pretty cheap  we'll probably make  back our whole budget  before the weekend  is over  nice  how much did it cost  it's a 31 million  dollar movie  that's amazing  that's fucking amazing  do you think  that if you make  it like cheaper  like that  that they look  at it and go  like fuck man 
[02:21:30]  he's making  fucking eight times  you don't let him  do what he wants  because it's made  cheap  makes so much  yeah it's exactly  what it is  like if you're  in that range  you could have  as many giant cocks  in your room  you could have  Mike Sayre doing  coke and having  his ass eat  and no one  says shit  no one's gonna  lie  leave him alone  it's cheap  got some names  in it we love it  you just don't want  to be their  biggest problem  and like that's  all it is  is like don't be  the studio's  biggest fucking  problem  and like we've  been the biggest  problem  and like you  don't want to  be the biggest  problem 
[02:22:00]  you want to  be like the  other thing  that they're  not worried  about  way fucking  better  what movie  was the big  problem  Green Hornet  was their  biggest problem  fucking superhero  movies  those are always  their biggest  problems  no matter what  studio you're at  whatever superhero  movie they're  making is their  biggest problem  all the brass  got their fucking  hands in it  right  and it's expensive  and it's  and we're the  movie that we're  just making  and they're not  worried about it  what's going on  in the corner  ah it's just  sad  no the fucking 
[02:22:30]  the villain costume  it's true  it's exactly  what it is  fuck to the  mailroom clerk  he's got an idea  about the boots  yeah it's true  and as we were  those guys  you see all  other guys  like being able  to do whatever  the fuck they  want  and we're like  fuck  god damn it  we're absorbing  all the attention  you got anything  you're working on  now  anything in the  pipe  not you  Jimmy  yeah  we're about  to make  another  we're going  to direct  another movie  with me  and James  Franco  about two 
[02:23:00]  journalists  who try to  assassinate  Kim Jong-un  while interviewing  him  oh interesting  that's a good  concept  yeah it is  good  we were just  talking about  that like  that whole  assassinate  using the guise  of a journalist  yeah well that's  how the idea  came up  honestly  it was like  we were joking  around  like how come  they don't kill  him  why don't we  make a movie  where they try  to kill him  and uh  yeah so it's  about like a  guy  it's like  Franco plays  like a  Ryan Seacrest  type guy  and we find  out that  Kim Jong-un  is like a  fan of his  like he's a  fan of  American 
[02:23:30]  bullshit  and so  we get an  interview with  him and then  the CIA asks  us to assassinate  him like while  we're there  interviewing him  basically  yeah we were  talking to Mike  Baker who's  an ex-CIA  operative  he was in  here we were  talking about  Osama bin Laden  and some of  the videos of  him back in  the day  and it's like  just fucking  have a gun  camera something  like that  yeah and uh  and he actually  looked at me  he goes oh  yeah we never  thought of that  yeah exactly  like yeah who  the fuck am I  talking to  what an asshole  Walter Cronkite 
[02:24:00]  said no  are you fucking  kidding me  you kill him  yeah well that's  a great idea  and especially  using the goofiness  of Kim Jong-un  yeah I know  has he agreed  to do it  he's just a  comedy fan  apparently  can't get a  cameo  can't you  exactly  we're good  with cameos  how'd you like  directing him  I loved it  it was really  it was actually  really fun  like we've 
[02:24:30]  we've written  a lot of these  movies and then  you don't get  to be the one  to execute them  and they've often  have turned out  better than we  probably would have  done but it's  fun to just be  able to see it  through and actually  like do it  how you picture  it  yeah yeah  it's definitely  the most fun  part of the job  like it's not  harder than  producing a movie  which is what  we're used to  doing like it's  way fucking  harder to get  someone to give  you 30 million  dollars than  it is to spend  30 million dollars  and that's what  the director is  doing spending  all the money  that other people  are getting  right so it's  like actually  really enjoyable 
[02:25:00]  like it's it's  kind of the  least stressful  part of making  the movie like  everything like  it's sandwiched  and shit like  like getting the  movie ready sucks  and then promoting  you know making  sure that the  trailers are good  TV spots and the  press you know  making sure that  it's good like all  that stuff is a  fucking pain in the  ass actually making  the movie is like  by far the most  fun part of the  process and and  and as far as  directing how did  you did you just  jump into directing  at some point and  and were you  petrified that  seems like a  daunting task it 
[02:25:30]  does seem daunting  but I think what  we slowly realized is  what we had been  doing was actually  harder like that  producing the movies  and making sure the  director wasn't  going off the  fucking rails and  doing something  crazy like that  that all like there  was a point we  realized like this  is less stressful  than not directing  the movies but I  think like you  probably need a lot  of self-confidence  because you think  you get on set and  people are now like  all right that's the  guy yeah he's the  guy that's doing  this and you're  just sitting there  going oh my god  I'm the guy and I  don't have a fucking 
[02:26:00]  clue no yeah you  have to  that that would  happen everyone  every once in a while  you'd look around  you'd be like oh  I'm the one that  has to move this  like no one else  is going to do  this  why is this shit  getting done  yeah exactly like  oh everyone's  waiting for me to  tell them what to  do  why is anyone  doing anything  oh because I  haven't fucking  decided what we're  doing yet  but generally  yeah you need to  plan you plan a  lot you just try to  make sure that  doesn't happen a  good team helps  like the first day  you know we have a 
[02:26:30]  good first day D  who we work with  like that kind of  stuff like your  infrastructure is  helpful in that  situation yeah yeah  I hear a lot of  assistants help and a  lot of like a DP  a good DP is very  helpful we have this  young guy Brandon  who's awesome and  like really like he's  one of our good  friends now like it's  good to have like guys  like that around you  yeah yeah because  I've seen some  directors where it's  like they kind of  look through the  lens yeah and then  you don't even see  them anymore no like  everyone else kind of  does everything yeah  and we're always like 
[02:27:00]  writing like we're  pitching jokes during  the scenes and  during the takes and  like I think we do a  much more active  version like sometimes  they literally just  like say the same  shit every time like  right we never do  that ever you know  yeah yeah smart push  them to find crazier  new shit and that's  got to be so important  in a comedy because I  don't even know how  comedies can be filmed  like a regular movie  where you know all  right that's the  20th fucking take of  this joke and you  gotta still look like  you're offensively  yeah you know it's  funny and what's  hard with this is like  if someone improvised  something funny then  you do have to do 
[02:27:30]  that then you have to  cover it from all the  guys angles right  right now sure it's  funny and you and it  ends up you do have to  do it 20 times to  make sure it's the  best version but like  was that ever funny  yeah yeah  what the fuck but  you gotta like I  genuinely think that  like if we think it's  funny and we're like  dying like if we  think like this is  like genuinely fucking  funny then it is  almost almost always  actually funny yeah  yeah yeah it's very  rare that we are like 
[02:28:00]  this is super fucking  funny and we're just  totally wrong you're all  missing the fucking  mark there and it's  like and I think people  can tell when you like  like what I was like  when I watched South  Park which I love like  I genuinely get a  sense that they think  it's funny right which  is one of my favorite  parts of the show like  you can tell it's one of  reasons your show is  great like you can tell  you guys actually laugh  at each other and it's  nice you know and I  think like I think that  actually comes across  the South Park  documentary was great  because you saw them  kind of talking to each  other working out a bit 
[02:28:30]  and then getting on the  mics in the studio and  laughing their fucking  asses on it and you  can tell like I genuinely  think you can tell like  that the second they turn  off the microphones  they're laughing they're  laughing and that just  like the most inane dick  joke stuff yeah exactly  and you really get a feel  for who the people are  but it's really funny  somehow I like you  don't think that was  happening on Caddyshack  2 exactly  Jackie Gleason wasn't  really I can't I can't  do another take  fella yeah me say  yeah yeah yeah I got  all of them Jackie 
[02:29:00]  Gleason that's funny  yeah it should have  been in his state at  the time not one guy  thought that was a bad  idea exactly comedy  sequels are tough  oh man we've never  done one for a reason  but that one wasn't  even close no no  it wasn't a comedy  sequel but you just  made it into a drama  and told nobody right  yeah how disappointed  everybody would be  I know what Caddyshack  2 did  and Arthur went  fucking serious  oh Arthur 2 on the  rocks  that was an idea 
[02:29:30]  Sister Act 2 might  be the best comedy  sequel  yeah there you go  that could work  it might be the only  one that is good  it is you know what  it is I guess you get  you have to put the  same gags in stuff  and people have seen  it already  like they always do  that in the comedy  sequel oh people  laughed at that so  let's do it again  yeah but bigger  yeah yeah bigger  and yeah  has there ever been  a good comedy  sequel  that's a great  question  you know who did  well Austin Powers  I was going to say  Austin Powers  you know what  one of those stupid  like the third one  was on TV the other 
[02:30:00]  day and I just put it  on and I was like  actually like this is  pretty fucking funny  like there's some  genuinely funny shit  in this movie  yeah yeah yeah  Austin Powers pulled it  off absolutely  I think those types of  movies like I think  Anchorman 2 will be  funny I think movies with  like no emotional  weight or reality  whatsoever like  they're almost making  fun of the concept  of the fact that  they are movies  themselves like  I think like  those airplane movies  those are genuinely  naked guns are funny  yeah the naked guns  are funny  Hangover kind of  pulled it off  with the second one  second one's crazy  yeah yeah 
[02:30:30]  I mean there was a  drop off but it  didn't suck  it's hard to  it's hard though  to capture the magic  again  yes  the magic  but we're not  talking about that  this is the end  how is Barbara Streisand  I mean she's  somebody that you  know none of us  ever get to kind  of be around  it was really cool  actually to be around  someone like that  I mean as someone  who's like a fan  of movies and shit  like that like she  just knew everyone  she and I would  just because I was  in a car with her  all fucking day  so I would just 
[02:31:00]  literally like rack  my brain to think  of like god like  who could I ask  her about and it  was great like I  would just leave you  like you ever meet  Elvis and she  like oh yeah I  met Elvis and she  had like 10 Elvis  stories and he  like you ever meet  Peter Sellers  he's like yeah  she smoked weed  with Peter Sellers  she told me  she had a great  story and she  like knew like  Marlon Brando  she went on a  road trip with  across the fucking  country like she  knew all these  people and had  amazing and she  would tell me  these stories for  like hours and  hours and hours  and she was cool  super cool like  cool she you know  she's been famous  since she was like  16 years old and 
[02:31:30]  you know she's been  famous for like 50  years so it's like  you know there's  definitely some slight  you know  removed from  everyday reality  things that are  bouncing I don't  know if it's any  more than any  other Jewish lady  who's you know  around that age  but she like she  tries to she's  very nice like she  goes out of her  way to try to be  nice you know to  the crew and she  like buy ice cream  for the crew and  shit like that like  she was she was  nice I gotta ask  you something when  you're like you  spend a lot of  time in a car  yeah with her and 
[02:32:00]  stuff and I'm  sure that takes her  that takes a long  time yeah you can't  just cut a gasser in  front of Barbara  Streisand  no you can't  you can no you  cannot oh you  cannot be happy  about right she  would be vocally  were there any  instances where you  like oh fuck I  really got the fuck  out of this fucking  thing probably I  imagine I did yeah  once in a while yeah  I would try to get  up and walk around  walk around  spread it over like  a 30 foot  the more real estate 
[02:32:30]  you cover the more  diffuses I go to  the crowd I don't  avoid the crowd  she probably wanted  to fart in the car  too  oh my god I wish  she'd get out of  here  Barbara Streisand  doesn't fart  did she ask you for  any showbiz stories  uh no  the worst of the  week countdown on  the Opie and  Anthony channel  the NBA finals are  on Sirius XM and  the Sirius XM app  LeBron layup and

[02:38:00]  the Liberace movie the real dude and he  came into the studio everybody was a  little creeped out because he came  into the studio still looking like  Liberace from all that plastic surgery  that Lee made him do Scott Thorson  talking about Michael Jackson talking  about Charles Manson talking about  everyone and everything he's done to  them with them and in them Scott  Thorson in studio number one on the  worst of the week countdown  number one what did you think did you 
[02:38:30]  think of Matt Damon playing you I  thought he was excellent excellent are  you happy yeah very happy the movie's  number one it's the it's the the number  one movie since 2004 it's the Freigspiel  yeah right oh it did crazy numbers  what do you think about Matt Damon  pounding Mike Douglas I'm a fan of  both I like them more now I thought  that was great is that how you gave him  a pounding huh Catherine's got to be 
[02:39:00]  jealous was anything like what you did  to Liberace well I didn't do it quite  that hard he was a little older you  know yeah was that true though was he  really like because that might have  saved your life like the fact that he  that he wanted you wanted to fuck him  and you didn't want him to fuck yeah I  didn't he didn't fuck me and I didn't  fuck him he just oh you didn't fuck him  he blew you though right he blew me  wait a minute wait wait what oh man  you weren't having anal sex with him I  thought you were you were the giver I  think I think just once oh they copped 
[02:39:30]  her once no just once but it was always  protective sex and I think yeah why I  was alive and but he blew me I never  blew him though you never blow oh man  you never blew Liberace no come on what  kind of a friend are you how an ugly  cock it was it was full of uh uh um  we call it silicone was it he silicone  his dick up yeah now how how lumpy and he  and he was uncut and it was ugly wow uncut  lumpy silicone cock and he couldn't get it 
[02:40:00]  hard oh damn of all the silicone how wow  wait how big was it uh lengthwise about  that about that long no was he really  that long yeah are you serious but he was  italian what they used to do and the heck  they did this to john bob but i think when  ron put it was bigger than me though they  cut they cut that muscle they cut the  muscle so it just kind of hangs under the  vein it gets a lot longer well don't they  pull it out a little bit more too you got a  little extra longer then they cut the 
[02:40:30]  ten and then you can pull it actually out  to make it longer yeah like like john  bob but when they shot him up with all  the stuff it looked like a lumpy silicone  like a lumpy red bull cam man now it's  easier you can use the cock pumps they  work great right right yeah yeah yeah  they do work yeah yeah dick pump works  but but his dick was long and silicone  and lumpy which meant that it wasn't  silicone properly and uncut oh you don't  like uncut no no he's ugly ugly  lee's ugly dick when you can't pull this 
[02:41:00]  when you can't pull the skin away from  the head yeah oh god  no no that's phenomenal information  just enough information  so you would he would suck your dick and  what would you do all you're sucking your  dick just think of somebody else or would  you just close and fantasize would you  really not you never fucked him come on  never once just once i think once i  started and i didn't like it what didn't  you like about it i was only 16 years old  come on oh you were that young okay i was  young how uh how did he get off then 
[02:41:30]  like what was in it for him i guess he  just jerked yeah one of those bags that  he would use one day i caught him using  it you know when he came in what's the  bag we got quick pulled it up and threw  it in the drawer i didn't know it was a  pump bag and he was sitting there pumping  and i was watching he didn't know i came  in i was watching that's when he had his  wig off and he threw it over the shower  i gotta tell you a funny story please  he flushed an ounce of my cocaine right  and i got so fucking pissed off that i 
[02:42:00]  chased him down now you this this house  is 17 000 square feet anyway he was  running for and i really didn't mean to  but i grabbed him by the back of the  hair and i pulled the weight off oh scotch  you're such a bad boy  were you sleeping with other people at  the time it was he or were you no just  michael jackson you know now did you  really sleep with michael jackson yeah  how did that happen well uh i met  michael in the mid 70s and uh i was 
[02:42:30]  introduced to him by by liberace and  we just had a great relationship lee and  i broke up in 82 so i michael asked if i  would come and work for him huh so this  is when he was breaking up with the  jacksons you know his brothers and he  went solo and this is when thriller came  in and then we went to europe and we did  say say with paul mccartney big hat hit  and all that and we just hit it off 
[02:43:00]  michael fell in love with me i was a  pretty boy back then  were you the giver or the getter there  no he was the giver michael was michael  was yeah he was the giver yeah i was  very you know something and i'm glad  that i was that way because of the  aids epidemic back then i mean it was  bad you know rock hudson and you know  i saw rock a week before he died  lee and i went over to see him because  rock and him used to fool around years 
[02:43:30]  ago oh boy and they'd have all the sex  parties over there boy boy boys how long  did you know michael before it became  sexual or became apparent that he wanted  to be sexual with you well it wasn't  until uh 82 and then we were together  until about 85 and then when he started  getting really big he decided that well  we better cool this and and then uh i  went my way did you guys do a family road  trip with the plastic surgery or something  oh yeah i gotta tell you the funny story  i had a full facelift i had my cheek 
[02:44:00]  implants and the chin and uh-huh michael  wants to get his nose done no excuse  i'll back up i had gotten my nose done  and michael loved it and he hated his  nose because it was wide and looked like  joseph he reminded him of his father and  michael didn't have a good relationship  with joseph so all three of us her bandage  up in the back seat of the the limo 
[02:44:30]  rolls royce that that lee drives on stage  going to palm springs and and then that  crazy doctor which rob lobe right right  that was great shooting us up full  demarong and pharmaceutical cocaine and  bifetamines and this is how michael  starts his his plastic surgery and starts  the the drug addiction by uh pharmaceutical  wow drugs wait can i ask about uh the  michael jockson thing did the family  ever try to sue you or anything because  obviously let me tell you um i when i 
[02:45:00]  released this article in 2004 alan  butterfield the editor of uh the national  inquire uh flew in two experts and i uh fx fbi  agents and did um polygraph tests on me i  passed two polygraph tests one was offered  to michael because they were protesting and  michael refused to do it the jacksons have  never come after me now of course they say 
[02:45:30]  well oh no it's not true but i mean i've  never been sued um i did hear from the  attorneys in the beginning and then they  backed off once i you know the lie detectors  came in and then when michael refused they  told michael not to do it obviously because  michael it was true right and what do you know and  this goes way back you know liberaci called me a  fucking liar a disgruntled employee i was a  hustler i was a porn star i walked off streets of 
[02:46:00]  hollywood and and and i had you know i was  nothing but a liar they even paid my brother  wayne who passed away um my half brother over  twenty thousand dollars to testify and make up  stories about me that's and and you know they  were just a piece of shit back then right i got  one more question uh what do you think of  michael and the kid thing your opinion yeah it's  not those aren't michael's kids no no no no no  michael didn't do that see a lot of people 
[02:46:30]  say that it was just that he never really  grew up and just felt more comfortable hanging  out with younger michael michael would never  do that uh he was acquitted for interesting um  and uh it was uh this kid the kid i forget the  kid's name but the uncle is the one that uh you know  got the 20 million dollars from from um michael and  and so michael decided and and this came right from michael  he was afraid so he paid this guy 20 million dollars 
[02:47:00]  because he was going to expose him expose him as as a  child molester so michael paid him off but if michael  wasn't a molester what was he scared of well he didn't want the bad publicity  because that's just like liberace didn't want the bad publicity about me being 16  years old he you know we settled out of court and  all that oh you did settle yeah oh yeah you know what i'm having a hard time  getting my head around michael being a giver  that's yeah that was that really did sound a little you know give me give me this 
[02:47:30]  again michael was the giver yeah yeah he was seriously he wasn't uh he was he  was more of a top and a bottom that's an odd thing that struck me as odd  too i would have i figured he'd be a wimpy little i know i have to change  everything i think of now when i jerk off  but uh i mean he he got into oral sex and all that but i mean he he had a crush  on me i mean i was young uh and and then i got all the pictures to  back it up when michael and i were at lord montague's and you know at 
[02:48:00]  buckingham palace and i'll tell you a funny thing that michael and i did  you know outside the the queens you know and cast of these guards stand  straight they're not supposed to move yeah so what we did was we kept putting  a well we put about five grand on on the bayonets and we kept loading it up with  money and pounds and all that and we we said now you can keep this but we need a  picture and sure enough he moved and he grabbed the money  they're not supposed to do that and i sold it to the national inquire for ten grand too  so i got back the money 
[02:48:30]  scott was involved in the wonderland murders  right right yeah with john hall that's the john holmes thing  then i got gunned down and shot the contract place i mean i was shot five times  when you were with well let's go with wonderland you knew john holmes or who you  were there with john i i knew them all i knew well here's what happened in in 81  i became i took some of my money and i invested in  with nash because he owned a bunch of nightclubs  eddie nash yeah so he owned uh like 15 kick club 
[02:49:00]  kick cat clubs you know where the girls would come down in the cage the strippers  and then the club hollywood stars uh starwood um uh seven seas club hollywood  the odyssey anyway to make a long story uh short is that homes we would party with  homes up there at nash's place nash hooks homes on crack cocaine uh the the plastic  surgeon my plastic surgeon or liverashi's plastic surgeon shoots himself in the head 
[02:49:30]  so i needed a rob low character shot himself yeah oh  so i needed so i needed a a new drug supplier well nash brought in all the heroin cocaine  plus he had mayor bradley tom bradley on his payroll a couple dea agents anyway  homes sets up the robbery leaves the back door open they come in there and they stick a gun down  eddie nash's uh throat and make him beg and they took over a million dollars worth of drugs cash and 
[02:50:00]  and jewelry well i i'm in tahoe we're we're performing at the the sahara tahoe i take a  learjet back to pick up a pound of cocaine and some cash because i was collecting from the  from the the clubs well in walks he just had the robbery not maybe a couple hours before i got there  well when i come there uh gregory dials his black bodyguard brings in homes and they find out that  homes set up the robbery and they beat the shit out of homes and they ordered and i was there when 
[02:50:30]  uh nash gave the orders to have these people killed and they used uh uh liverashi's uh bill blast  lincoln uh to to drive homes up there and he participated in some of the killings up there john  wow now what was it now what was the killing there was the robbery and then what happened  and can you can you walk us through that because you do what there was eddie nash's house was robbed  yeah it was robbed and then so what they did was they found out who was responsible oh the actual 
[02:51:00]  and then they were called the wonderling gang okay i've been called uh laurel canyon there's a street  called the wonderland avenue so that's why it's called the wonderling killings laurel canyon and um  so they they ordered uh nash ordered these people executed and they actually killed the wrong people  one guy was there but they killed all the girlfriends you know so they killed four girls and one guy 
[02:51:30]  or was it three girls and one guy and then there was uh a count of attempted murder so there was four  counts of of uh of first degree murder and one count of attempted murder well you know the famous uh  homicide detective that handled this case that handled oj that fucked up uh oj's case tom lang oh wow that  was him yeah and so anyway to make a long story i testified uh nash puts a contract on me because he 
[02:52:00]  starts smoking that crack and gets all paranoid and the next thing you know i have a contract  placed on me i go to florida and i get gunned down and shot so i testified nash gets a hold of one of  the members of the jury eleven of them came back with guilty plea found them guilty one was not guilty  then back in uh 99 the feds then decided to well we're going to go after him for money laundering  racketeering so they brought the murders back because normally you can't double jeopardy you can't do that 
[02:52:30]  but anyway uh he testified or he uh they get a deal with him he he uh pled guilty to conspiracy to  commit murder on the laurel canyon and also for jury tampering the one lady that i told dale davidson and  all the other uh uh district attorney and the u.s attorneys that he got to me and so there was a jury 
[02:53:00]  fraud and then uh 250 000 fine he only spent 33 months in prison can i ask where you were when you  got shot you said you were in florida yeah yeah what happened there how what was that what was that  moment well well what happened was um i went on the federal witness protection program and i was so  fucking bored i mean these guys they take you they take you to the loony ben i mean way out in the  sticks i mean come on with my life so what i started doing was running cocaine and the perfect 
[02:53:30]  thing i could do was running it with the federal marshals in their car and going through the  airport they never checked me and then i became a preacher i did the billy graham i did the pat  robertson i became yeah i said oh the you know the horrible sins of hollywood and and uh and they and  they ate it up but they loved it were you being sincere huh were you being sincere i think for a while  then after i found out how the politics in those fucking churches i mean i mean they were horrible  especially some of this now he goes to the witness protection program right so nobody can find you and 
[02:54:00]  kill you well he gets five bullets in him right and then he decides well you know i kind of like the  celebrity thing of liberaci so i'll just be a minister yeah but i want to know about the day you got shot  yeah what were you doing in that what were you doing where you were surprised like oh fuck they found  i was in a hotel right in uh jacksonville florida and they come in they shoot me in the head the  hand here because i put my hand up it went through here and came out there yeah there you go wow  then right above the left nipple they shot me penetrated the heart and then i took three bullets 
[02:54:30]  through the abdomen wow with a 38 up close right from where dennis but you know i kept getting up you  know i was pretty big back then and i managed to break one of their you know kept fighting and then  finally i says i better lay down you know i was running out of blood then oh so you got shot in  the head the heart and three times in the stomach yeah and uh what kind of abdomen damage did it do  because the stomach seems like a you know the motherfucker well the big thing was is i was 
[02:55:00]  paralyzed it went into my spine and then i became paralyzed and then they uh the doctors only gave me  about two percent chance to live that day and then i became um i died and they brought me back after  like almost 15 minutes i was pronounced dead wow what do you see anything and you see the light no  i saw the devil i saw the barrage big cock  the big lumpy 
[02:55:30]  but i had to learn how to you know talk and walk and eat again because i went into a coma  and then they couldn't when they were cutting me open they only paralyzed me so i wouldn't move  because my blood pressure was so low so i felt all that cutting through the bones and  and ripping so i mean this is what uh you know makes movies and and books we noticed that you're  wearing a lot of jewelry yeah who's who's is that that's uh some of the gifts that liberaci gave me  that's why i was wondering it looks like it was these are some of the ones that i i didn't 
[02:56:00]  pawn yeah yeah they threw me out so you you were worth a lot of money at one point after liberaci right  oh yeah but you see the nash got it all well no the federal government got it all because  when nash uh uh the killings they cracked down they closed every fucking club they took the property  for income tax irs yeah there was no way you were getting your money from them and you went through  and you obviously went you went through a lot of your money oh well yeah did you behave fiscally 
[02:56:30]  irresponsibly i was irresponsibly you know you gotta you gotta realize you know i were all those years  with lee and lee i mean you know he'd spend a million dollars a week on me i mean we're buying  me homes and furniture and we were in in in buffalo new york and lee comes out yeah or no uh the manager  that owns the theater there he had a beautiful uh 1962 silver cloud rolls royce all gold and with 
[02:57:00]  black tinted i saw i i love that well my 21st birthday was um the following week well liberaci brought  uh baron hilton had designed the you know the the he took the garage out and made a big casino out of  there but anyway before he took the doors off he you know he had that car in there with a big box and  ribbon on there and then a little box that had the gold rolls royce key in there and i mean that  he was a very generous man oh man he was loaded man how much money 250 million 250 million dollar 
[02:57:30]  estate and counting cash in real estate was it true that hilton put a casino in your house and tried to  get some of his money back well they brought the casino well the main reason why baron supplied it  with the slot machines and uh the uh the roulette tables was because of frances and liberaci she had  a horrible habit of of hitting people with a cane and they were afraid of lawsuits so what they did was 
[02:58:00]  they baron uh loaded the the casino all the slots and the roulette tables and all that so we had a  private casino it was a beautiful home seven actually he built that house for me it was uh five  track he bought the whole whole block and it was a 17 000 square foot palace that's nothing but glass 
[02:58:30]  and mirror was absolutely gorgeous you know where they filmed all this was at jaja kabor's house  oh wow jaja's house yeah that was uh pretty impressive too did you get to see her she's what down to a  head yeah they cut her leg off oh yes they're taking a body part every other year i think her husband's  just waiting for that day to go oh yeah he's gonna load up on everything he's amazed that she's  lasted this i don't doubt she's 90 93 94 years old yeah but you know i don't i mean that you know i 
[02:59:00]  mean she and jaja was the bitch you know who was the nicest one was ava ava ava was so nice she'd  come in with merv griffin what another queen that was oh my god well you know he loved ava kabor  and and that was his front you know if she she made all the public appearances yeah yeah he was you  know at home sucking cock and you know but i mean did you guys ever party with him yeah yeah  merv was one oh yeah he'd bring uh his little boy in and and do the thing do swappies and all 
[02:59:30]  but that's why i've ever stuck your penis ava kabor did merv ever stuck your penis no but he could  have i mean he was low he's he was more loaded than liberaci what happened to liberaci's house  is it still there yeah they have it up for sale they're trying to sell for 375 000 now he put over  two million dollars that's it 375 yeah but he he built it in the 50 000 neighborhood  oh shit okay and now it's a drug-ridden area oh wow with the museum now here's a great idea 
[03:00:00]  wait wait liberaci's house is in a bed i i never knew that it was always in a bad neighborhood well  this 4982 shirley street it's right off of tropicana across the street from the university there  all bad area now it's drug and then the museum is on tropicana right below maryland parkway i'm the  one that put that museum together in 78 i took everything out of the houses and and put it  together we bought the shopping center of course when i got in when we broke up he took all the 
[03:00:30]  pictures of me out of the museum but now the the museum is bankrupt see the karma goes around now it's  bankrupt now they were hoping that this movie would be successful uh-huh so what i'm what i would like  to do is we're dennis and i talking about this is boy what a great idea that would be with putting  dennis has got 22 acres out there horse stables he's got a gym you know two million dollar gym out 
[03:01:00]  there he's got this beautiful bunny ranch put the liberaci now that he's got a history with me  put the put the museum out there i could tell the stories then we can get a reality show scott  thorson at the bunny ranch with the i'll put on a pink outfit i'm gonna make you a bunny boy  or either he can start pimping me out i mean maybe he can get a hundred thousand dollars and i'll give  him 50 of it i mean come on i gotta ask you about liberaci there's rumors that he uh tried to have you 
[03:01:30]  killed after he left well um let me just say this i was beat up pretty bad uh in the penthouse  this was done by seymour heller i was also threatened that if i if i if i uh went to the press  um that uh i would disappear in in las vegas but you know that i had balls but i mean i took a here  here's a big powerful man around michael's chin and uh you know baron hilton of the the hilton 
[03:02:00]  hotels and all that right you know they threatened they told me to stay out of vegas and that's one  of the reasons why he even took my house back that he got me out there he says well i'll give you  seventy five thousand dollars for it but you're not coming out here i went out there anyway i  terrorized i just can't i used to throw eggs at his house wait wait wait that's the best you got  from last i mean that's the best we have from the past week the opian entity worst of the week

[03:12:30]  right and i put it on twitter and i got tons of answers  wonderful tons of answers was that the funny story uh-huh okay but you know what the funny part  is no i don't twitter is almost like ask uh jeeves remember i asked uh jeeves remember when that first  came out you could ask uh jeeves almost anything which is basically google google i believe it's just 
[03:13:00]  called ask it's ask yeah but it's really uh jeeves and i don't know why he gave up his name i would  be pissed off if it was ask voss and then all of a sudden it went just ask like what the fuck i have  so many problems with you right now i can't even i would go first of all what what i don't understand  the because you just use twitter to find out from people's stuff all the time yeah send me i'll give 
[03:13:30]  they'll help you out that's what's good about twitter like i but all your followers have to  listen to you but they don't all have to help me i don't want you know 40 000 answers but you're  clogging up the not clogging up anything what if everybody that you followed was just asking  questions about stuff then i'd have two questions to answer oh you don't follow anybody that's right  no i follow like 20 something people but you know i just too i know too many like but that's the  thing about you see that's like i know too many people i don't want to start following everybody 
[03:14:00]  no i don't want to be who cares nobody people do not sit around and be like why doesn't he follow  me what a jerk i follow him it's not like that once you get into a certain amount of followers it's  just and then you have if you follow 300 people then you have every time 300 people write something  that comes up on your thing how can you keep up with it you scroll yeah so say say you're  say you're following i'm following you yeah and then 300 other people yes you write something

[03:20:30]  no i did because he will not book me your future bookings but it's not like you canceled all my  bookings that that's i don't know how you define fired but no okay how would you so you're gonna just  sum it up in a couple of words what would you call it you're not allowed to work the club anymore  you're not allowed to work the club now as of now with this booker you this booker is not going  to use you the club the owners of the club the people that own the club who is al martin did not  call you and say you can't work my club just the guy that i didn't say anything about what the club 
[03:21:00]  was but thanks well well he didn't the guy that books the club says i'm taking your dates out that's  all if another booker comes along and books that club you could probably work that club there's a  difference between the booker not using you or the club not using you so the booker's not using  you now go ahead with the story with this jackass you know the way they you know well this is not  like a club that i do it's it's in new york city but it's a shit hole it's uh you know it pays the 
[03:21:30]  bills so no it pays tolls it pays the tolls it pays the tolls and the babysitter so some weekends i  come in i do this club you do it just to get out of house and do a spot you don't you're not i do  kind of make a little money on it yeah but it's it's more for your to work out material right right  right to feel bad about myself but if i'm really feeling okay i go down there and get my feet back  on the ground uh-huh um so anyway so i go in and oh so the the spot times always change so i kept 
[03:22:00]  texting him asking what my spot times were and before so i could tell the babysitter what time  to come and then he calls me and he says you know we really kind of fucked up and you're supposed to  have three spots now you only have two three shows yeah why people know what spots are not all people  comics know what spots oh come on the public doesn't know the public knows three shows so 
[03:22:30]  three spots doesn't sound like you're getting paid three shows sounds like you're getting paid  oh my god okay so um one of them is canceled which was slightly annoying because the day of he  canceled the day of he canceled yeah hours before i was leaving okay you know two hours so already  whatever so i said fine whatever it's okay he goes i'll make it up to you i'll give you some more  spots which was in my head was thinking like that's not really making it up to me like i know 
[03:23:00]  he'll give me more spots anyway like not anymore no not anymore but at the time i was thinking like  it's not like he's getting like great comics to play the club you know what i mean although i don't  want to disparage people that play the club but it's it's a shit hole it's it's it's yeah people do it  to just get a spot they're not like excited about going no they're doing it in between other shows  to make some quick cash yeah it's like if you don't have to do it you don't do it it's like  when you foot when john stamos flew around with you yeah i mean what he did it in between hotties 
[03:23:30]  to keep practice you know go ahead so tell the story so then i get down there and uh i walk in  and i make a joke to him what was the joke i go i'm not gonna do well but only because you  cancel one of my spots it's payback something like that like it's a joke you know but but really  knowing in my head that i probably wouldn't do well i mean it's not like i i don't bomb there but 
[03:24:00]  it's so like uneven it's like it's like chug it chug it chug it chug it so okay hold on hold on if  you're gonna buy something from amazon for real go to riotcast.com slash my wife hates me and then  click the amazon button before you shop all right go ahead excuse me so um then i don't like doing  reads the the mc is introducing the first act and the first act is not there well they don't even know  that the act's not there well then dustin comes out of his eye whoops i said his name then the guy 
[03:24:30]  the booker comes out of it oh i never mind the court the club is dusty you're saying yeah it's  a very dusty club and um so the booker comes out of his office and uh he's like why who gave him the  light i didn't tell anyone to give him the light yet you know the host yeah because the other guy  wasn't there and i go don't worry i'll go up it's fine so i put my bag down he went check it off  like whatever it's not a big deal go up right and when you say bag you mean just probably you didn't 
[03:25:00]  have like bags from like bloomingdale's you didn't come in with a bunch of shopping bags  my purse i put my purse down in the office i literally just people think you walked in with  groceries and stuff i put yeah i had my baguette so um i go on stage you know i had to go to the  bathroom i didn't get a chance to go it was fine go on and then as i'm doing my set well you didn't  go if you had to go to the bathroom before you don't you get scared that you'll you'll pee the stage 
[03:25:30]  no i can hold it okay i'm a lady um so then uh but i mentioned it that the guy didn't show up and  whatever like you know making jokes about it and then there's a bird outside stop it you're just  what is wrong with you i saw you stand outside some adhd medication i looked out the wood there a bird  went by i went like that i thought it was that crazy girl you want me to just stare at your eyes the 
[03:26:00]  whole time no oh my god i can't am i going crazy or is like the people around me i don't know like  am i new heart or am i one of the crazies like i don't know anymore i just i don't know  so um no because new heart gets to work that club  it's a beautiful bird by the way where is it oh it's a bluebird  it's gorgeous okay so then oh i'm gonna take a picture in the middle of the set 
[03:26:30]  i'm pretty close to the beginning set the mic keeps going out and i keep trying to fix it with  the cord you know i'm moving the cord and every time i go tell joke it's like pops out pops out  pops out so finally i say dust it i say to the guy who books it i was like you have to fix it  you know i go i don't and then they came and they changed the mic in the middle of my set  are you kidding me are you making a phone call right now i'm listening no you're making a phone 
[03:27:00]  call right now  it's a wrong number some lady no i was listening to a message i thought it was important  but it said hi sheree happy birthday now sheree is never gonna get never gonna get the birthday  call that was probably from the lady and she's gonna be like you didn't say you didn't even call  me on my birthday oh i feel bad for i called you oh come on are you calling her back i'm gonna text 
[03:27:30]  her go ahead keep telling the story i'm not gonna keep telling the story let me text this because i feel  you know why if if honestly if this were the reverse you'd be like freaking out so bad right now  be honest would you no not at all i was texting and stuff how do you spell sheree s-h-e-r-e-e i mean  i think you could spell it any way you want i spelt it c-h-a-r-i that's fine no that's not it  go ahead this story is interesting i was really upset about this 
[03:28:00]  i'm not sure a wrong  number  good now she'll call sheree back i don't want to say it anymore all right let's go i'm for real  you know you gotta quit getting upset you know like when we go do radio they're telling stories  but they're also doing other things okay yeah if i went did radio fine i wouldn't give a shit but  this is you know a podcast that you particularly want to do okay oh you don't be doing this podcast 
[03:28:30]  if it wasn't for you i wouldn't be on my own doing a podcast once a week well neither would i we do it  as a team my wife hates me like boom zip zip neurons  getting it so you go on stage you're already or let me recap this already they cancel one show  yeah then now you're going on first right i don't mind going on first at that club though i have to say 
[03:29:00]  because you don't know what you're gonna have to follow i mean sometimes it's a lot a lot of dirty  yeah he likes you know comic new comics that are dirty yes it's not the cleverest of anyway  so um but but there was good comics there so i don't want to disparage any of the comics that  were there but at times that club can be a little weird so um anyway he changes the mic 
[03:29:30]  in the middle of the set i make some jokes about it continue on my set in the middle of the set he  comes on stage and changes well not him but but somebody that worked the club and then that mic  worked terrific and i was like what you've been saving this mic for chris rock like what why why  what a day before the show starts that's what i mean i was saying all this on stage which i think  might have been part of the problem later yeah of course it is why but it was funny i was telling  the audience like you should yelp about this you know it's a joke obviously i was being funny it was 
[03:30:00]  funny all right i mean it wasn't like i wasn't getting applause breaks or anything but i mean if  you're on stage if you're on stage and somebody's changing the mic okay let's say like you're really  just gonna stand there and no i'd make fun of it in a second thank you i do it all that's what  that's what comics do i would in the second okay okay but don't so is that wrong to do that no not  at all but there's always consequences for what you do i mean like if you're on stage uh making fun 
[03:30:30]  of uh say the booker if you're on stage and the mic was getting changed and you're in the audience if  i mean if you're in the audience and the mic was getting changed and the comic didn't make jokes  about it you'd be like wow that person really yeah no of course that would be awkward situation  i mean it wasn't awkward at all because i didn't care it wasn't like i know i'm sweating it or like  oh no no move on i get it but the consequence because it all adds up in the booker's crazy head  well it did all add up it did all add up okay so then like say the guy who books the room 
[03:31:00]  was hit with like an ashtray and a chunk of his head was missing and he walked by  and people would see it you'd have to make fun of it but you go oh my god a chunk of your head is  and you do whatever chunk of your head missing material yeah which okay easily but you know  well there are certain things that you might although you know i did watch um you opened for  me once at the stress factory do you remember that the opener didn't show so the headliner didn't show 
[03:31:30]  and they well i was i replaced the headliner but then you replaced then vinnie was supposed to open  oh yeah and then you replaced vinnie so it was just a weird situation where you were opening for me  and and the lady fainted a lady fainted during your set right at the end of your set because she  thought i was tom jones ha ha that was that was your big joke huh no but i was very funny no it  wasn't a big joke it was a funny a little ah tom no but you definitely uh worked in the moment  worked in the moment you made fun of the the ambulance people paramedics they're not ambulance 
[03:32:00]  people i don't know the emt whatever i couldn't remember what they're called ambulance people  whatever  you love it when i make mistakes you just love it hey 9-1-1 someone's sick can you send the ambulance  ambulance people okay hey hey you need some ambulance people hey pull the car over ambulance 
[03:32:30]  people are driving by all right go ahead so um so um anyway i get the light from the mc with his  cell phone that first show and i do my whatever minute get off get to the back i think that the  club the the book is gonna thank me or make a joke or something but he just goes you went long  like that was his response to all the problems that happened so i thought he was joking so whatever 
[03:33:00]  hang around a little bit then i leave um go hang out of the cellar a bit come back for my second show  um tom papa um uh norton  i don't know  anthony bourdain  anthony bourdain was there no  um i don't i don't know who else was there mark pitta was there 
[03:33:30]  mark pitta yeah no yeah why the fuck was he there from i don't know  he was there with his like friends and stuff and then he did a set too mark pitta yeah  stop with your mark pitta you don't even know mark i do know who he is how do you know mark pitta  i worked with him once where i in canada no you went out with him no why he was a good looking guy  back in the day he still is no he isn't yes and he's got a hot wife how hot hot like playbait hot 
[03:34:00]  no fucking way yes he's a hack  richard no i don't even know why would you say such things i don't know  so anyway he's got a radio show i think out in san francisco now you'll never get to work it  i'm only kidding to be broken  it's burned and you don't break a bridge god it's a it's a burned bridge hey you don't want  to hire her she'll break she breaks bridges all over the place wait stop oh my god ambulance 
[03:34:30]  people can't go over this they burn things because of our house situation all right go ahead  tell the story mark pitta where the fuck did he come from so i go back and estie put him on like  he was a celebrity no i mean but everyone was being she was being really nice to him i mean  he was obviously just a one-time thing that he came to new york and did one set like i don't know  if he ever worked out in new york i don't think so go ahead whatever who cares i have nothing against 
[03:35:00]  the guy so i go back the guy who didn't show up the first show is there and he's uh yeah wait hold  on let me apologize i shouldn't have said he's a hack because i've never i haven't seen the guy  in 30 years i remember him being funny yes he was funny for a hack no i'm only kidding he's not a  hack i don't even know i shouldn't have said that for real i take that back i take that back and i  apologize because i just said that out of you know what i mean it was dumb i worked with him years and  years ago at uh i really don't want to finish this story go ahead tell the story i can't finish it's 
[03:35:30]  going great it's not too long it's going great that's how stories are that's what  draws people and that's when i tell a story i give details like okay so so by the way this  booker is also a comedian i should mention that yeah well so he's got the guy he's got high energy  spanish act on in front of me well after the first show we're on the second show now okay the audience  is what the audience is very mixed audience but it leans towards it's very spanish minority yeah 
[03:36:00]  spanish yeah negro a lot of negroes um i mean i don't know i can't i can't i just walked through  it once you know but uh i mean if you saw some white people in there i did see some white people  if you were you know had a sketch artist here and they had to draw everybody in the audience  what would it look like um well let me just say this i remember a guy with a big white face that 
[03:36:30]  stood out okay um so uh anyway so whatever the guy goes on before me and he kills he's killing he  always kills roberto oh he's funny and i was and i was you know saying like i go i love this guy but  i don't want i mean actually let's give him our shout out our comic shout out goes to right 
[03:37:00]  roberto although backstage before i went on him and this other guy and i can't remember his fucking  name and it's really driving me crazy they were joking they were saying something backstage i go this  is what it's all about you know backstage or whatever and roberto goes no it's not it's about  being out there leaving it on the stage getting a development deal or whatever something like that  and i was like that's a little harsh i mean it was like a little weird because i was just obvious i mean 
[03:37:30]  do you misunderstand me all right he's not getting our shout out then like it was a little weird like  he was like schooling me on and i was like okay but i think because the the booker in between sets  had been bad mouthing me it really felt like that like the the the the the the staff wasn't really  looking at me do you know what i mean like i think there was a rant that went on about me  we're going over by a minute or two and making fun of a broken mic i don't know i don't know i'm just 
[03:38:00]  speculating i'm just speculating look i think part of it is okay so i'll tell the rest of the story  then we'll go back so then i go on after roberto and i think i'm gonna die but i actually start doing  pretty good he kills let me tell you it takes me a while but i start getting the audience and i was  actually shocked at one point how well i was doing i wouldn't want to follow him right and i'm a big  and uh but then i started doing some some jokes that were you know more on the new side i i lost 
[03:38:30]  them for a while got them back i didn't get the light and i i'm thinking on my head it's going long  but and also when you're on stage like this is during the lull so i'm struggling to to get back  on top to do jokes so you're thinking about that um you're thinking you know i i remember you know 
[03:39:00]  from the first show where he's like why did he get off why is he saying that you didn't get the light  the you know all this stuff is just sort of like just flittering through your head while you're still  doing jokes i'm trying to remember my next thing that i wanted to talk about and whatever so i'm in  no way doing anything on purpose i don't see the light it's just like this thing where you get the  light you get off like as a comic you know and so keep going keep going so then i get the light the  cell phone the mc with the cell phone and from the minute that i get the light to the like it's a minute 
[03:39:30]  till i finish my closing joke i get the light 30 times and in fact i even realized like the mc is  standing right next to the stage like right here like his foot could be on the stage that's how close  he is to the stage give me the light and i'm like it's too weird so i just like finish and i actually  finished strong get off and the minute i get to the back dustin the the dustin the fucking the booker 
[03:40:00]  goes to be uh um 10 minutes you did 10 extra fucking minutes and i go whoa wait like hey i  didn't see the and then he goes don't you yell at me i'm not yelling at you and he might not have been  yelling per se but he definitely was using a very strong voice and i was like i wasn't yelling i don't 
[03:40:30]  think i mean i just literally go off stage so uh i was like okay that's weird so then he's in front  of everyone all the other comics are back there all the staff is back there and he shoves the money  like practically throws it at me and is not yelling but giving me a real tear down and a dressing down  as i would say in canada i got a real dressing down and so i said to him for i go look i'm sorry 
[03:41:00]  i didn't see the light i shouldn't have gone over well i wouldn't and i was embarrassed too i was  really embarrassed like and i go i go i know it's important to stick to my time so i really apologize  why was there another show after it yes there's a third show there which at that shit hole they do  more than yes i was supposed to do all three shows oh oh yeah and he canceled you the day  canceling me in a second so i think he thought that i did it on he he he kept acting like i did  it purposely to be an asshole he goes you don't respect this club you don't respect me no one does 
[03:41:30]  you know whatever no one does and then but here's the thing he was going on next but even though they  were running long obviously i did like an extra whatever i don't know if i did an extra 10 minutes  but also it's embarrassing to go long it is embarrassing to be that kind of like you you know  that when you're going along everyone backstage is like ah come on like every joke that you finish  up on they're like and then you start a new one they're like ah you know it's like you don't want 
[03:42:00]  to be that person i go long everywhere well you're rich you have a different set of rules that you get  to live by that i don't so then um so anyway i pick up my bag i look at the girl that's sitting  there that's like on the same show and she's just looking at her feet like she won't look at me and i was  like uh it just really made me fucking i don't know why it's like make a joke give a look something  like really like she was when her boyfriend was yelling at you she didn't even get involved she 
[03:42:30]  just stood there she just sat there looking in her shoes maybe she got new shoes that day i know  she really like and so um so i just grabbed my bag out of the office and i walked out  and to add salt onto the wounds as i was walking out oh so the show's going long but dustin must have  told dmc do a couple extra minutes i'm gonna have to chew her out so he's getting introduced as i'm  walking through the crowd and i hear someone in the crowd go oh he's funny like as though i'm not you 
[03:43:00]  know whatever so that's fine i leave and the minute i get outside the club i text him and i say look  i'm really sorry i didn't do it on purpose i had you know my instincts were that's going long i  should have trusted my instincts i'm sorry i should have known better like couldn't have been more  apology i couldn't apologize more i shouldn't go ahead so the next day he writes me three texts  that are really mean one of them said go eat pray love somewhere else i don't know what that means 
[03:43:30]  i don't know what maybe it means read a book somewhere else i don't know what it means but  it was like that i'm a dick and you know here's the thing is that i get called a dick all the time  all the time like but the thing is is like but you you're allowed here's the thing like am i am i  i don't i honestly don't think i was disrespecting the club like and then i have to think about like  oh because then he sent me those three texts but wait wait about what a dick i am and that like 
[03:44:00]  he's not going to use me anymore whatever but he sent me an email like i didn't respond to the  text and he sent me an email saying really you you know i can't remember what it said but it was  like the end of it was like i all shows canceled i tried okay here's the thing first of all you  tried but also no i just want to just just one thing you have to like kind of like look at your  behaviors i mean and be like god i get into this situation all the time all the time i have men 
[03:44:30]  just literally like i'm sure there are other comedians that have gone over at the club there  was a guy that didn't show up he was on the second show no problem you know so obviously it's not about  that well you don't know you don't know the excuse when he came in he could have said hey  you know whatever i mean okay but the point is is that you know i mean there's a thousand black  comics that worked at club i i know they're not all fucking sticking to their time no not at all 
[03:45:00]  so i know it's not about that but so it's about me rubbing people the wrong way personally do you  know me but there's nothing i can really do about it because don't why would you i think like  like when i'm fucking around like that i just think that's that's why i'm a comic that's what  being a comic is about if i wanted to like walk around and like kiss people's asses and hug  babies i would have got into the corporate world or something i would have no you've been a  politician kissing babies okay corporate do you understand what i'm saying yes no i get it i wanted 
[03:45:30]  to like play the game that way listen and it's not like i'm mean to people i'm just i just think  that they like they take like that shit that i do that that like like he was like i have a meeting  at cmt and i go oh they finally saw the cowboy hat someone finally noticed the cowboy hat he has  a meeting at cmt yeah so but that was like a joke it wasn't meant to be mean but i'm sure in his mind 
[03:46:00]  he's like oh she fucking did it again they don't get it here's they don't get you you know i know they  don't get it but like i'm saying the point i'm trying to make is do i change or do i just accept or  but i can't take i just it's like this thing of being just tore down publicly all the time i can't  you don't get it you gotta do well you gotta fight it like to do it okay the problem is you don't fight  back and go go fuck yourself you hack you first of all no no no it takes me a while the processing 
[03:46:30]  and i honestly no no when someone's yelling at you you know that can i just can i just stick it for  myself now then the the point is is that i honestly don't want like if i'm wrong i don't  want to just be one of those people that's like never takes into account anything like i did go  over you know i was wrong so i did apologize but in retrospect when i put it all together i'm like  wait he fucked me over first and i was nice about it and then and then when i made a mistake 
[03:47:00]  he just fucking look destroyed me pop like in front of everyone first of all a guy first of all  no you gotta process when somebody if someone of his status in this business okay what he's accomplished  and what you've accomplished okay the fact that he would even try to yell at you and you are you  fucking kidding me that's like are you kidding me i went over a couple minutes if that was if that 
[03:47:30]  was voss or bobby kelly or like if i were to bring up anything like that i know people would be like  you think you're in the same category as that yes when it comes to credit like you'll go fuck yourself  you know many men tell me comics that like i only get anything because of you no that's bullshit  your credits are is i know but they they think that i don't care credits are bullshit because i'm a  girl oh really married to you or whatever you had look look here's the problem you think they put 
[03:48:00]  you on letterman because you're married to me i haven't done letterman these comics will use no  that part they think is because i'm a girl that i got a little bit of an extra shot even though that's  all okay there's not enough and then and then this guy got it because he's black and this guy got it  because he's crippled you don't understand like they okay like dustin had to open for me  at a casino not that long ago yeah the one yeah yeah i don't think he was too happy about but i  fucking ate it like i good in the middle of that set i was like i might get fired like this is the 
[03:48:30]  thing people see me and it's hard it's even hard for me to i was thinking about this like it's only  job where you you get told by 300 people every night that you suck and you're still driving home  being like nope they're wrong no first of all i don't want to and it's like it's i know but wait  we don't you're in denial because you're not working to 300 people i'm okay but the thing is is  like i'm accumulating the shows um no but i'm saying like then dustin sees me eat it there he sees me 
[03:49:00]  fucking not do so great oh before i went on the second show he goes do some jokes please i know you  got jokes just do them because i don't know he doesn't like what i've been doing on stage lately  who the fuck cares she's not your manager i know but it's like i i they see me fucking eating it and  they do well and yet like they see me get more than them and then it drives them fucking bonkers and i 
[03:49:30]  get that i get how that can seem but and i but but like the truth is is like there are times when i  can pull it together and do well i don't know i don't even know what i'm i don't even know like  that's what i think like maybe i like would that happen that night i was like like that's the thing  about stuff when people go that's a sign you know or whatever but is it a sign or a test maybe it's a  test like if you can keep going through this then you're gonna make it nothing but it's like i was 
[03:50:00]  like it's a sign that i should stop doing standout because if you're getting fired from the worst club  in new york city like if you're getting yelled at by a booker in a cowboy hat like then you need to  you need to you need to jump ship that's it you're done if first of all if you put in all these years  of experience all these credits all this and you're but i'm still fucking like everybody no it is  digging around in the mud trying to get a foothold here's the let me let me give you a an analogy 
[03:50:30]  i played great golf a couple weeks ago i shot a 78 i mean great golf like the best courses in the  country i'm very respectable and for the last two weeks i can't hit a ball i mean it's like i'm  hitting ground like i've never played but i know i'm gonna snap out of it and i know i'll be back to  where i was okay so it's the same with comedy okay if you're having tough spots your shows it means  you're getting to another level when you go from one level this is what joe de rosa told me when you 
[03:51:00]  go it's because i probably told it to him because i fucking know can you believe though that i called  joe de rosa about this and i was like look uh i go you know me better than anyone like am i that much  of a cunt am i like you know and then he was like he was like no no yeah well he but he probably  later he'll talk to dustin about what a cunt i am but but when you know he was actually really 
[03:51:30]  really really really nice when you go from one level to a higher level in between that you drop  down a couple levels and then you boom and then you're back now here's the deal but there is  something about my personality who gives a shit everybody look at norton's the biggest asshole on  the planet i know bobby kelly's an asshole i know but there's something different about it  patrice was the biggest fucking asshole on the planet but we're all assholes this crew  the whole crew are assholes colin's an asshole in his own assholey way okay he's a nice guy asshole 
[03:52:00]  norton's a nice guy asshole de paulo's a nice guy asshole bobby's a nice guy asshole we're all  assholes and then you have these guys that are so fucking serious and think oh look at this i have  a meeting go fuck yourself what does that mean we've had a million meetings you want me to tell  you what's going to happen nothing okay this is what your meeting is going to be nothing okay you're 
[03:52:30]  going to go in there with your cowboy hat you know you might even get one of those belts that they used  to sell at the fucking trading company stores the indian ones with the beads in them i always like  those belts you know belts i'm talking about that had the little beads in them yeah i want to get one  of those okay all right huh so the thing is they're they're look at five minutes going over a couple  minutes it means nothing whatever you did that night whatever you did whether you went overnight i did 
[03:53:00]  it it doesn't matter he was already he was already irritated you could have walked in there with a  with a you know cake and ice cream for him you know or hey look at this gift he was mad at you or he  has resentment and anger towards you for whatever reason it had nothing would do with going over  it was already there okay he already canceled the show on you he already put you you already filled  in for somebody didn't show up the second show you had to follow you know a high energy killer act 
[03:53:30]  so you know what fuck these guys fuck them who cares you know you got a fucking movie you made  whether even if the movie doesn't sell it's going to go online eventually we're going to put it online  everybody's going to see it and they'll see the talent that you have okay so you're not working  these fucking knife fight rooms and you're right norton bobby me all of us can work these knife fight 
[03:54:00]  rooms because our background is coming from knife fights all right do you think uh who's fun ryan  hamilton funny guy right really really fucking funny and i'm using an example do you think he's  going to work a knife fight room that's not his style but when they're listening he fucking kills  okay so dustin's room is a knife fight room so fuck you fuck your room you called me many times to do  uh fundraisers for you which i've done because they're always good causes okay one time you had me
