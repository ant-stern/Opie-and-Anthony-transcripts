<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a self-deprecating introduction acknowledging their often vulgar style.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, launched into a discussion of Opie’s recent illness, punctuated by a running joke about an alleged bowel accident based on a Twitter misunderstanding.  They then contrasted their contrasting preferences for the longer daylight hours of summer.  The conversation shifted to their viewing of advance screeners for upcoming TV shows and movies.  They gave enthusiastic reviews of the new season of *Louie*, mentioning Parker Posey's appearance, and also discussed screeners for *Breaking Bad* and a Kevin Smith-esque high school film, *Bindlestiffs*.

A substantial portion of the show focused on the difficulties they experienced in booking celebrities, particularly Billy Corgan and Mark Wahlberg, blaming publicists and citing a past Eminem album leak as a possible reason for the perceived roadblocks.  This led to a discussion about the power and sometimes underhanded tactics of publicists.  They then discussed a frustrating email from Don Imus’s staff regarding Jim Norton’s return to the show, which contained veiled criticisms of a previous guest's performance. This sparked a discussion about the pressures of stand-up comedy on other people's shows, with Norton expressing his annoyance at the email's tone.  The show then tackled Adam Carolla's controversial comments about women in comedy, leading to a debate on gender and humor, touching upon societal expectations and their influence on comedic styles.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about a viral video depicting the relentless bullying of an overweight bus monitor by school children.  The hosts and crew reacted with a mix of shock, disgust, and amusement, using highly offensive language to describe both the children and the monitor.  They speculated about the monitor's personal life (mentioning the death of her husband and son), the children's motivations, potential consequences (including death threats), and her unexpected financial success from donations.  They compared this situation to their own experiences with hecklers and the perceived lack of consequences for bad behavior in society.  This segment culminated in the arrival of Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins.

The interview with Billy Corgan covered his new album, *Oceania*, his experiences with critics and fans, his struggles with his Twitter handle, and his views on the music industry.  He discussed his early success and the complexities of the music business,  the challenges of managing online interactions, and the low conversion rate of online fans to paying customers.  He contrasted his approach to social media with that of artists like Justin Bieber, criticizing the exploitation of young fans through sexualized imagery.  He also touched upon the impact of technology on communication, the possibility of holographic concerts, his encounters with Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love,  the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's omissions, and the changing music industry landscape.  The interview concluded with a discussion of a past negative interaction with Opie and Anthony, which had since been resolved.  The segment ended with a Smashing Pumpkins song and a barrage of "Fuck You" messages from listeners.

The show continued with a discussion of seemingly random topics including John Sterling's Yankee home run calls, a botched robbery, and a news report about the home run calls, before announcing the arrival of Warren Sapp.  Sapp was promoting his YouTube show, "Judge Sapp," and the conversation touched upon his recent financial difficulties, including bankruptcy and potential foreclosure. Racially insensitive comments were made about Black people's frequency on court shows.  Anthony then showcased his new drone via video from his YouTube channel.  Warren Sapp then joined the show. The discussion covered the legality of unwanted advances, Sapp’s past marriages and financial losses due to divorce, his views on women choosing partners, anecdotes from his football career, the NFL bounty scandal, his experience on *Dancing with the Stars*, and his retirement from football.

Following Sapp’s departure, the hosts discussed the show's dynamics, including Sam Roberts' return and his initial reaction to Sapp. A prank with an autographed football, mistakenly attributed to Eric, resulted in Eric's anger and the accidental destruction of iced coffee.  The show then moved to listener feedback on the Billy Corgan interview, focusing on Corgan's dislike of Eddie Vedder and expanding into a broader conversation about inter-band rivalries.  The hosts and callers also discussed a recent bike ride involving Roland and his fitness struggles. Further discussion ensued regarding listener reactions to previous segments about the hosts' and their wives' bowel movements.

The show's final segment centered on a discussion about Eric's weight, with joking speculation about his wife leaving him and the impact of a potential pregnancy.  A humorous debate ensued about the exact wording of Eric's previous statement about his wife's bowel control.  The hosts suggested various consequences for Eric's weight, including a forced bike ride.  Eric mentioned upcoming gardening plans before the show signed off.

[00:00:00]  Hey, yo, what's up out there?  Nice to meet you.  I'm going to sit.  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  If you're not going to find this offensive, just don't listen.  But my guess is you'll be sitting around.  Let's do this.  It's going down jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show  right here on SiriusXM's satellite radio.  This is good radio right here. 
[00:00:30]  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted, I'm telling you.  Who's enjoying this shit?  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony.  Dick crisis.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you ladies, remember that. 
[00:01:00]  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, it would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Not enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  There she is.  I haven't seen that yet.  No?  Great.  Am I going to laugh or am I going to cry?  Both.  Both.  A little of both, I guess.  It's like a good movie.  Yeah.  A little of both.  The pudgy bus aide.  The bus assistant.  Whatever she is.  Making the bus monitor cry.  The bus monitor.  That's out of the Rochester area. 
[00:02:00]  Brother Wheezes people turned me on for that video.  Is it?  Yes.  Yeah.  Remember when you take a few days off and you don't listen to the show?  You don't listen to the show when you're not here, right?  You want to take a break from the whole thing.  No.  Only if I was, like when I called in that day.  Right.  I listened for a little while, a little bit.  See what you're yapping about and then I'll fucking jump in.  Yeah.  Well.  Yeah.  I guess, according to Jimmy, I've been shitting myself.  Silly. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, a lot.  What?  All over your balls and your legs.  Yeah.  I never heard such a thing.  I was checking the Twitter.  The Twitter.  The Twitter.  And I was getting a lot of shit tweets.  I'm like, wow, what is this about?  I'm really confused.  Why?  Why do people think I'm shitting on my balls?  Fucking Jimmy.  I guess it's been a thing.  Yeah.  Talking about me shitting.  Yeah.  Every day it was that you're just shitting more and that it's on the back of your legs.  I think one day it was that you were wearing a butterscotch colored skirt to the back  of your thighs and casual. 
[00:03:00]  People just tweeting me going, I hope you stop shitting by now.  I'm like, what?  What is this about?  Fucking idiot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was brutal.  The description's very graphic.  Yeah.  Something that nobody would want to deal with.  Yeah.  Well, great.  Actually, that was the only thing I wasn't doing was shitting, but.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's completely normal to have the flu when it's 100 degrees out.  Completely normal, right?  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  Does it matter?  I never knew if the temperature mattered.  I don't get sick when it's warm out usually.  No?  No.  But ever since this kid.  The kid comes home with all the fucking shit.  He's a little fucking germ transportation device.  And you've known over the years that I'm a bit prone to get sick to begin with.  Oh, well, yeah.  Well, yeah.  And now having the kid come home with new germs every day.  This is not a good combination.  All these great new germs to bring home. 
[00:04:00]  No, I bitched because we were all healthy.  Then when I brought him to the doctor, he got sick.  Because, you know, there's sick kids at the doctor's office.  Oh, yeah.  And then the whole family's sick now in the middle of summer.  I know summer just started, but I'm calling it the middle of summer.  Yeah.  It's the first day today.  So.  That's great.  First day today?  Yeah.  First day of summer.  First day of the year.  And then, yeah, now.  And all I think about now is, oh, great.  The days are going to get shorter.  It's going to get dark out again when we're fucking leaving for work. 
[00:04:30]  Dark at three in the afternoon.  I know that takes quite a while.  Well, yeah, but you're kind of right.  Because December 21st, shortest day of the year.  Yeah.  I start thinking, oh, it only gets better from here.  It's better.  Yeah, you're right.  I like when it's darker earlier.  You guys like when it's light.  I prefer when we come to work and it's pitch black out.  I really do.  Really?  Yeah.  Why is that?  It's still light out at 930 at night.  I like all this light.  Call me crazy, but I like that.  I like all this light.  I wake up.  I come to work.  It's light out.  I'm a big fan of light.  It's like fucking 830 at night. 
[00:05:00]  It's still kind of light out.  Kind of.  It's real light out.  I like that.  When you wake up and it's pitch black and we come in here and then we leave here and  you know, by 330, the sun's going down.  Yeah.  Who likes that?  Oh, it's just depressing.  I just like the sunlight.  Well, how about we just balance it out?  How about we balance it out?  Yeah.  Can they do that?  Yeah.  Part of the year, it's 9 o'clock and the sun's still out.  And then another part of the year, it's 3 in the afternoon and it's pitch dark.  How about as human beings, we figure it out, finally. 
[00:05:30]  Figure out that whole thing.  We'd have to change.  I'll sacrifice an hour or two this time of year to make it a little lighter, you know,  that time of year.  But we'd have to keep changing the clocks.  I don't give a fuck.  Whatever it takes.  It would get really annoying.  Just give everyone an app.  An app?  Yeah.  This is the actual time.  And then I think with businesses dealing with the whole world.  So?  Ah.  Fuck those people.  Who cares?  I just want to be in the park after 3.30 in the afternoon.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  I don't know.  I do hate when it's dark early, but I do love when it's a light out late.  Oh, God, yeah.  It's nice.  This time of year, it doesn't totally get dark.  You notice that?  You look up at the sky and it's kind of...  Like what is that, blue?  It's already getting ready for the sun to come up.  It's like one of those fucking, like being in Alaska or the Arctic Circle or something.  So bizarre.  It stays a little blue.  The sky stays a little dark blue.  Are we going to be frying eggs on the sidewalk today?  Yes.  Today's the day.  Another heat advisory. 
[00:06:30]  Ooh.  Yesterday was very hot.  Today should be a record-tying day from 1988.  1988.  That's what they say.  I don't remember though.  That's not that long ago.  I know.  You get creeped out when it's like since 1820 or something like that.  Since they started keeping records.  Yeah, exactly.  But we got to like cook something on the sidewalk.  Yeah.  I like to know what that's like in 18-fucking-60.  That's like 1863 and the temperature's hot.  And they only know because some guy's like, 
[00:07:00]  My dearest Bedelia.  It was hot as the dickens today.  I shot me some other plantation workers because they weren't working.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Lost one today.  Lost one to the heat today.  Cotton production will be down.  You call that the good old days, don't you?  Well, you know.  No, I heard that they were going to fry an egg on the sidewalk.  Oh, they're doing that old gag?  Does that actually work when it's 100 degrees? 
[00:07:30]  I think it can.  Really?  Maybe the street.  Maybe like the pavement.  The black tar.  White sidewalk.  That sidewalk.  But yeah.  Yeah.  I do believe you can do that.  I wouldn't eat it.  Not recommended.  Not recommended.  Eating it at City Street.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Another hot one.  It was too hot to stay outside yesterday.  It was just too fucking hot.  I actually walked around a little bit yesterday.  It was nice. 
[00:08:00]  It was nice.  Nice?  Getting out of the house.  I can't stay in my fucking house.  Oh, right.  Well, if you're sick like that.  Holy shit.  I finally said, fuck this and walked around a little bit.  Yeah.  And I think I sweated it out because I turned the corner yesterday afternoon.  Sweat it out.  Have some brandy.  Sweat it out.  That's old school.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you walk around yesterday and it's just, the air is thick.  Yeah, you feel it in your lungs, right?  It's thick.  Thick.  Like a fucking pancake batter.  Yeah, but the girls were wearing nothing. 
[00:08:30]  Well, yeah.  Holy fuck balls.  It was fucking brawless tits all day long.  You saw it, right?  I'm way down to the cellar.  I saw it.  It was fucking eight o'clock at night.  Holy shit.  Fantastic.  I sat on a park bench like an old man just staring at tits yesterday.  Oh, yeah, I did.  Were you making noises?  Oh, God, Jesus.  Yeah, because, you know, the women, they're like, fuck that.  Fuck the boulder holders.  There are occasionally, you're walking down the street and you look and just go like,  you do make a noise, you go like, Jesus. 
[00:09:00]  Jesus Christ.  You're like, oh.  What did your dad used to say?  Jesus Christ.  Son of a bitch.  It's like a little sing-y song thing.  Oh, they were out in full force yesterday.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  One of the brothers was in front of me walking out of the mall yesterday and there was a  very attractive black girl walking out.  And the brothers, they don't care.  They'll just, the guy's like, oh, hell. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, man.  Oh, shit.  And she's just, she keeps walking.  Yeah.  I'm like, wow, there's just no, no line there.  Well, if you see a good set, you know, you can't help yourself.  You're right.  Hell no.  But like I said, I'll go like, oof.  Like, I'll just make a sound like, oh, jeez.  Like, she won't even hear it.  You follow girls?  But he's just like, oh, motherfucker.  You follow girls?  I've been known to follow a girl. 
[00:10:00]  Alter your roots?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Will ya?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Not gonna approach.  Not gonna do shit.  But you see something really nice walk by.  It's like, well, I could sit here and hope that something as nice comes by.  Or I could just go for a little stroll.  Or go with that.  Yeah.  Well, you know.  I've been known to run ahead a couple blocks.  So you could get the.  So I could see the front view again.  See it coming?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Not often, by the way.  I don't want, you know, I'm not that creepy. 
[00:10:30]  I don't think I have.  You've never decided to change your route?  Well, no, I must have.  Obviously, I must have.  I must have.  But it's not a standard operating procedure for me.  I'll usually just, you know, take the peek.  Yeah.  I do.  Sometimes you go around and you're like, oh, it was disappointing.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  Sometimes you get one view.  It's nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This time of year is great for that, too.  Not all bundled up.  Bundled up?  My God, no.  Not for a while now.  I hate that, too. 
[00:11:00]  Thanks.  What the fuck did I miss around here?  Anything good?  Anything good?  Let me say.  Harvey Weinstein was great yesterday.  He was really good.  I'm fucking bummed.  Harvey.  Harvey Harvey.  What is he promoting?  It's a French film.  Oh.  Yeah.  It's called The Untouchables.  It was really good.  I'm horny.  Oh, you saw the movie?  Yeah.  But it was annoying because I know they have to brand it, but it just said Spencer, what's  it last name?  Midich or something?  Across the...  Oh, really? 
[00:11:30]  Oh, no.  I didn't see that shit coming.  It was across the middle of the screen, his name.  Like in a very light...  The whole time?  Yeah.  I wish they would have only done that for a few minutes, but...  I'm used to that by now.  We get so many screener copies.  I love when they put our names on the screen.  I'm like, holy fuck, we're part of this movie, I think.  I feel all important.  And shit.  Yeah.  I was telling Anthony, man, I saw the first five episodes of Louie, and then people were  like, you must have a really bad fever. 
[00:12:00]  I DVR'd FX, and I don't have any Louie episodes yet.  An actual tweet, by the way.  Actual tweet.  Dummy.  We're lucky to get stuff in advance, and I don't want to explain that to people that  are that stupid.  But we got the first five episodes, and I went through those five episodes.  I tweeted about it last night, but holy shit, man.  This is Louie's best season yet.  And all the seasons have been great.  Yeah.  I watched it too.  Fantastic. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  It's great, right?  I should watch it.  I'm so bummed to have it.  I hear it's fucking amazing.  Just watch it.  It's a little different.  And you know all the people.  It's a little different.  You just don't want to be influenced by it, that's all.  This season, there's a whole scene with your picture in the middle of you and Maria Bamford.  What's her name?  Bamford.  What is it?  The cellar?  The female comic.  Yeah, it's at the cellar.  Louie's talking to her.  In the hallway, and there's little Jimmy Norton right in the middle.  Right in the picture.  Up on the wall.  Yeah.  That was pretty funny.  I don't know what we could say, though. 
[00:13:00]  You can just be vague about it.  I think it's got a different feel than the other seasons did.  Absolutely.  It's...  I don't know.  I don't want to say darker.  It's not darker.  But it does delve into...  It's a little deeper.  A little more serious subject matter.  But funny, because it's Louie.  Right.  You know, he's able to walk that fine line.  Right.  So it deals with more of his life issues.  Yeah.  But it's funny.  But it's funny.  He doesn't need our help, but I want to help promote this. 
[00:13:30]  But I don't know what we could say.  It's...  He's getting into the dating thing.  I think his kids brought up the point that he's got to, you know, get out and maybe get  a girlfriend.  Yeah.  So he does that.  And, of course, it's fucking funny and weird and sad.  He got Parker Posey.  Parker Posey's in two episodes of Louie.  Yeah, Parker Posey's in there.  And she's amazing.  Yeah, yeah.  She's a great actress, huh?  She's phenomenal, dude. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Amy Schumer did a movie with her.  She's great.  Why isn't she used in more stuff?  I know.  Remember that?  Remember?  I know.  I forgot about that.  Yeah, Voss talking about how Parker Posey should be used in more stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's great, though.  She plays kind of a...  Well, see, you can't say, man.  Yeah.  Fuck.  We got to get Louie on the phone to see what we can talk about.  Yeah.  Because, I mean, we bring up some of the stuff.  We definitely could discuss it.  Yeah.  Definitely.  I think he explores his softer side in one episode. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Kind of softer side.  Yeah.  We could talk about for two hours on this show easily.  So, after that episode runs, I'm sure we'll go with it.  Louie premieres next Thursday ready.  Oh, next Thursday at 10.30 p.m.  On FX.  So, set your DVRs.  It's so weird what they beep out of that show, too.  They didn't beep anything.  No, no.  I mean, like, I think on the screen of copies that we got, they don't beep. 
[00:15:00]  Well, they beep.  On FX, sometimes they beep things.  Like...  I didn't know they beeped.  Yeah.  Sometimes they do.  We've seen beeps on that show with like, well, with fuck.  You know, I don't think FX lets fuck get through.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  But it's going to be interesting.  When I watch the screener, I'm like, are they going to beep that?  No, they didn't on the screener, but...  No, but they beep when you're watching on FX.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a few, very few, but they do.  Huh.  And I'm watching thinking, hmm.  Huh.  I wonder.  Huh. 
[00:15:30]  He's such a New York guy.  He really does portray a New York guy very well in that show.  Louie, I think he downplays it, but he's a filmmaker, man.  It looks great.  He is...  He writes and directs it.  But those are all his shots.  He does everything.  Yeah.  But he's a filmmaker, man.  Oh, yeah.  He knows how to fucking film shit.  Yep.  He's so...  Holy fuck.  When he's getting people ready, it's like watching him deal with...  We did something, and he was worried about the lighting.  Right. 
[00:16:00]  And the director of photography, whatever, was telling him, like, nah, I think we should  do this.  And Louie just knows what he wants.  He's like...  Yeah.  No.  And then the guy tried to put another light in and sneak a light in just to get...  And Louie's like, what the fuck are you doing?  I don't want that.  Holy shit.  But it's funny, but he knows what he wants, and like, he's very confident when he's...  He's definitely in charge of the set.  It's like...  And he knows what he wants.  It's really great to watch.  Some directors just...  The director of photography does everything.  Yeah.  And he really...  He was, like, saying that to the...  Yeah, but he wasn't... 
[00:16:30]  They're friends, but he was just...  Oh, obviously.  He just knew the guy was trying to get a shot a certain way.  It's kind of funny.  And Louie will just move people around.  Like, he'll move somebody.  He'll be like, sir, can you move down?  And then he'll, like, whisper, like, get the fuck out of the shot, you cunt.  Like, yeah.  Shit.  Guy's just trying to stand in the camera's lens.  Like, he knows what a guy is just trying to stand in the camera.  Oh!  That's funny.  Some people would let that slide, yeah.  He's just like, nah.  He knows what he wants.  He doesn't give a fuck.  Very good.  That's funny.  That's great.  Anyway, man. 
[00:17:00]  I'm glad we got the screener copy.  That was nice of them.  Yeah.  And the first five are definitely all home runs.  So, good for Louie.  You know.  Good for him.  And then I watched the Kevin Smith movies pushing Bindlesticks.  Yeah.  How was that?  Fucking good, man.  Bindlestiffs.  What is it?  Bindlestiffs.  What does Bindlestiffs mean, by the way?  Is it a name they came up with?  No idea.  Because I think it's the name of the homeless woman that's in this fucking movie.  Really?  Yeah.  It's pretty fucking edgy and weird. 
[00:17:30]  I have not seen that yet.  You should see it.  Yeah.  Probably.  What is it?  Did you get a screener?  Yeah.  We all got screeners on that.  Because he was going to promote it.  But then something else happened.  Damn it.  So, he's going to promote it later this summer.  I guess a bunch of kids made a movie.  Yeah.  A bunch of high school kids made a movie.  Did I get it?  Bindlestiffs.  There it is.  Yeah, yeah.  High school kids.  Right, right.  Remember that?  Hey, high school kids.  Thank you, fucking Roland, for that one.  Yeah.  Tidbit of information.  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  Hey.  You'll laugh so hard, you'll barf your teeth out, is the slug line.  Won a bunch of awards, so, eh.  If you guys haven't seen it, we'll go see it, so we'll talk about it.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  I got to see that one.  I'm waiting for Breaking Bad.  I'm supposedly getting the screeners for the first, like, four episodes or something  on Friday for that.  Fucking psyched.  What?  For Breaking Bad.  Oh.  It's good, bad, kind of thing. 
[00:18:30]  Mm-hmm.  Because then I watch them, and then I can't watch Breaking Bad for like a month.  That's right.  Because I've seen them all.  That's what I was saying with Louie's show.  But it's great.  I'm like, you just fucked up your TV watching for a month and a half.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck.  But it's great.  It's like, okay, I got to see it, but you're like, ah, fuck.  Right.  Everyone's talking about it.  You saw it already.  Everyone else is excited to see these shows, and we'll be way ahead of them.  Yeah, yeah.  So it's, I don't know, you take the good with the bad, I guess.  Yeah, I'd rather watch them in advance like that, though.  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  I'm gonna go into the movie theater, pop it in, and just fucking watch four hours.  We got Billy Corrigan coming in today.  Nice.  Yeah, that's fucking cool, huh?  You got him on Twitter.  I saw that.  I was following the drama, so I'm like, what the fuck?  Because I've heard over the years that he knows of us, and we're huge Smashing Pumpkins fans.  So I go, I would try to be cool.  It might have been a little dicky.  I go, what the fuck?  Not cool, man.  Why aren't you doing our show?  He wrote me back.  Oh, I had no idea.  Which goes to Jimmy's point that some of these guys just never know.  Yeah. 
[00:19:30]  I say all of them never know.  Really?  Yeah.  I think all of them never know.  It's always their people.  And then I'm like, look, we'd love to have you.  Period.  So he couldn't have been cooler to me on Twitter, and now he's coming in today.  Which we're psyched about.  But what's the deal?  It's something we did 10 years ago?  Yeah.  To one of his people?  No, no.  record.  It's probably the same publicist.  Is that what it is?  Yeah, it's publicist.  It's not Billy.  It's the publicist.  So why should they care if we did something with one of their other clients? 
[00:20:00]  Just fucking shut up.  Well, because he wrote me and goes, I had no idea you guys even wanted me.  And I'm like, what?  I go, of course we do.  I said, somebody in your camp has a problem with something we did 10 years ago that had nothing  to do with you.  Right.  He goes, oh, alright.  And then he goes, let me get to the bottom of this.  Yeah.  So what was it?  The Eminem thing?  That was definitely one of the things.  I don't know what else it was, but apparently his publicist said you guys have fucked him  over multiple times.  The Eminem thing is 10 years ago. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  That was when his third album came out or something.  We openly admit that we've changed as a radio show.  What do these motherfuckers hold onto these jobs like popes?  Leave.  Do you even remember the Eminem thing?  I know we released some tracks and we got massive publicity for it.  I remember listening to it.  You put out the whole album.  It was on MTV and everything.  You got a big fucking hit.  But how did we get the album?  Well, you're a jaded motherfucker that you are now when you actually were a fan of the  show.  Wow.  The publicist gave it to you.  That guy. 
[00:21:00]  To listen to.  Oh, to listen to.  And then you put every track on the air.  I swear to God, I don't remember this.  Whoops.  I do remember we leaked the tracks, but I don't remember how we got the album and all that.  Why would anyone give us an album and trust us?  That's stupid.  Yeah.  Do you know, I fired my publicist yesterday and I just got an email from somebody saying  that they were happy for me.  They were happy for me.  Sometimes publicists, it was not over something like that.  Wow.  A lot of times you don't know.  How did that person know you fired the publicist?  At least my manager.  Oh.  Did you go, you're fired?  Fuck. 
[00:21:30]  No, but there's times where you don't know as a performer.  This wasn't the case of mine, but a lot of performers just don't know.  Yeah.  Publicists don't tell them.  I'm one of those guys that always wants to know everything.  People who represent me, if I ever think they're being rude, like for real.  Oh, yeah.  But a lot of guys are just kind of going along doing their gigs and the publicist doesn't  tell them anything.  And they fucking wield power like that.  And if you didn't tell him on Twitter, this show never would have been brought up.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Give him the big fuck you.  Yeah.  I figured if I, maybe if he happens to read my tweet, maybe we could work something out 
[00:22:00]  because I really like Billy Corrigan.  Fucking Smashing Pumpkins are amazing.  Is this kicking off our artists of the 90s?  I'm hoping.  Kind of a thing.  Oh, yeah.  Will he play for us today?  I don't know.  I do see an acoustic guitar sitting right there in the case.  I told the guys to get the guitar just in case.  Just in case?  Just in case.  Put it on the seat right next to him.  Well, Roland told me, he goes, he might have shipped his guitar to L.A.  He's leaving for L.A. right after our interview.  Yeah.  I'm like, well, find a guitar and just have it laying around.  Maybe we could get him. 
[00:22:30]  I don't care what he sings.  Yeah.  Anything.  Anything would be great with that voice of his.  I don't think he will, though.  Will he?  Well, I reached out to Mark Wahlberg.  Same thing.  Yeah.  Dude, what the fuck?  Seriously.  Did he get back?  No.  I don't think it's him, though, at all.  I don't think it's Mark Wahlberg at all.  All right.  But you could.  But and I love the listeners that are following our leads.  And they're like tweeting in a good way, by the way.  And I appreciate that.  I've seen.  You're a fucking asshole for you.  Right. 
[00:23:00]  Because we are trying to get these guys on.  You know, this movie Ted is going to be huge.  And I don't understand why we don't get anyone from that movie.  Yeah.  That's ridiculous.  I wrote Mark Wahlberg.  I'm hoping that maybe he would read my tweet and the thousands of tweets that he gets.  He either read it and ignored me or never saw it.  But I'm like, you should be doing our show.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  If you come in for your charity, then it's common sense says, come by and say hi to the  boys for the big movie.  It's amazing how the performers like why?  Like enough.  Like we've been way too nice. 
[00:23:30]  I'm not saying we, you know, give everyone a fuck you, but we start asking questions to  these people.  Like why?  Yeah.  You know, Mark had a great time on the show.  I know.  And he even said as the mics went off, like, you know, I'll come back and see you guys  soon.  I'm like, cool.  We had a nice little thing with them.  And a movie like Ted is, I think we're talking to the same people that are going to go see  Ted.  Yeah.  Probably.  Of course.  That's pretty similar demo.  Domo.  It's like, can you, can you imagine getting an email from a radio show that says, hope you're 
[00:24:00]  well.  That's a comedy special.  I do.  However, have to mention that we are invoking what is now referred to on the show as the  and they name a famous comedian rule, which is simply that we want our comedian guests  to come on and be funny.  I know that will not be a problem for Jim, but just had to mention it.  Let me know what works for him next week and hopefully we can lock in a date and time. 
[00:24:30]  Ugh.  Wait, what?  That's too confusing.  I think it is too.  I apologize.  Is it too confusing?  No, no.  I get it.  I forwarded it to you and I read it with everything in there.  You forwarded it to me.  Yeah, you just probably didn't see it.  I just, I sent it to you yesterday.  Wait, who, who sent this?  It's from Imus's.  It's awful.  Imus is a, I don't know, a woman who works for him.  I don't think it's his producer.  I think Bernie's the producer.  Wait, they're trying to get you back on?  Yeah, but like.  But it's an insulting fucking invitation.  They mentioned another comedian's name. 
[00:25:00]  I'm not gonna mention him because.  Could you write it down for me so then I understand.  Yeah, just, uh.  Here, here, here.  Um.  I won't, I won't do that because they said that to me in a private email.  Yeah, no worries.  I won't say shit.  But I'm good these days.  These days.  Could change at any moment.  What about it?  No, that's the comic's name that they mentioned.  So I don't want this.  Yeah.  So the email is this.  Hope you're well.  I wanted to touch bases.  We have to have Jim back on with Imus next week to promote his comedy special. 
[00:25:30]  I do, however, have to mention that we are invoking what is now referred to on the Imus  in the Morning program as the blank rule.  As the John Doe rule.  John Doe rule.  Let's say John Doe is a comic.  Okay.  Who didn't do well, I guess.  That I gather didn't do well.  Oh.  Which is simply that we want our comedian guest to come on and be funny.  I know that will not be a problem for Jim, but just had to mention it.  Let me know what works for you.  Like who wants to go on after that shitty email?  Yeah.  All right.  You know what?  I blame, and I love the guy, but I blame Imus. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, I do too.  If something's not working, you got to step up.  Because, you know, the person they are mentioning there, we've had on the show, it's easy to  say that because we've had hundreds of comics on, and we did all right with him.  Yeah.  We absolutely did all right with him.  Right.  It wasn't...  He wasn't our funniest comic.  Right.  But we got something out of him.  Yeah, it was certainly a nice...  And if you do a radio show, sometimes you sit back and if they're killing, then let  them kill.  But if it's a bit of a struggle, that's when you have to step up and try to save the segment. 
[00:26:30]  Right.  That's what annoys me so much.  He's like, he's not kidding.  And it was like, the appearance I did on Imus was fine.  Of course it wasn't my best, but it was fine.  It wasn't bad at all.  But Imus didn't really work it at all.  And...  I didn't know what was going on.  Jimmy Norton was...  Oh!  No, it's higher.  I didn't know what was going on.  And it's like, you're trying to be respectful of the guy's platform.  Like, sorry, you want me to go on and do my...  My opening line is about how I hope Al Sharpton is killed in a plane crash.  You want me to do that on your show, stupid? 
[00:27:00]  I don't know what I can do, what I can't do.  Right.  It's like you panic.  Yes.  You're trying to be...  I would rather err on the side of caution and not get the guy in trouble.  Right.  I'm not going to curse, but I don't know.  What if he gets in trouble because you're doing some kind of Islamic joker?  I'm trying to ease into it.  You should go on and just do horrific old black jokes.  But it's like, for real, you want me to just do...  You know, he's like...  In blackface would be...  Oh, my God!  Just walks out in black...  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God! 
[00:27:30]  Go to break there, Magoo!  You've done it again.  That's what I would do.  Fuck him.  It's like you can't win.  It's like if you go on and you say, I know I can't curse, but if you do something too  brutal, they're going to go, what are you doing?  Like, he mentions Tim Tebow to me.  And I didn't do anything with him, but all I wanted to say was, I think he's gay!  Right.  Tebow's gay.  That's my opinion.  You can't say that.  I'm...  He may not care.  He may go, yeah, me too.  Right.  Fine.  But I don't know exactly.  I don't know what the temperature of that show is to listen to it. 
[00:28:00]  Look, man.  Last time you were on Imus, Imus was way off.  Period.  Period.  And he was hoping that you would just carry the entire show.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  And you did fine.  But then he just starts throwing stuff out.  Like, how do you even know if...  Maybe Jimmy doesn't have anything on these guys.  Or, like you said, it might be too edgy for his program.  Well, yeah.  And I don't even mind that.  But to me, he wasn't...  It's like, don't douche me.  Yeah.  Like, he wasn't trying to...  He wasn't...  And I know that he, on some level, likes me. 
[00:28:30]  But it's like, come on, dude.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  So you gonna do it?  Imus in the morning program, 25 past the hour.  Jimmy Norton, unfunny comic.  You're gonna be on the cinema.  Imus in the morning, 5 past the hour.  And, uh, unfunny comedian Jimmy Norton.  You're gonna be on the...  Yeah, fuck that shit.  Fuck that.  I'll get my Fox demo covered by doing Hannity.  You still gotta work...  You still gotta work your own show there, Imus.  Can't just sit there and assume everyone's just gonna kill for ya. 
[00:29:00]  But yeah, we were just having a chat.  Right.  Fuck, I'm sorry.  I guess I didn't know you want me to come out and do bits.  Oh boy.  I didn't think that's what the show was.  Radio war.  Nah, I'm not gonna bash him.  I know.  I really won't bash him, but I'm just like, fuck that shit.  Send me a fucking email like that.  We're invoking this rule.  Really?  Yeah.  Ugh.  It's a sad day.  Put Imus on the fuck-o list, Sam.  Oh no.  It's gotta be done.  Nice.  It's gotta be done.  That really annoys me.  That email...  But that was what started...  That was with the final nail in the coffin 
[00:29:30]  when I said how I wanted that handled.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  And I was livid that it was not handled how I wanted it handled.  Did you...  You had the same lady?  What's that?  Same lady that goes back a bit.  You're a publicist.  Yeah, it was the same person.  Mm.  And I'm sure she does a great...  She did, you know, she got me a lot of presses.  I'm not saying she's incompetent or she's not good at her job.  I just thought it was time to separate.  Now everybody's guessing whose rule it is.  Nah, but I won't...  I won't say only the rule. 
[00:30:00]  Anyone get it?  No.  No, not yet.  As annoying as that email is, it's like, eh...  I wish we could...  I wish we could mention the comic.  Yeah.  Because he...  He was a challenge.  Hmm.  He was a challenge.  Yeah.  It was...  But it was good.  Yeah.  I don't think it's on our highlight reel or anything.  Mm.  We were away from it going, oh, boy, that segment sucked.  No.  We absolutely...  You know.  It was just...  It was good.  It was a conversation.  Sometimes conversations are okay. 
[00:30:30]  The Rita Rudger rule.  The Rita.  No.  I don't know what I missed it last time, but I opened my fuck-o list file.  Yeah.  He was already on it.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  We'll keep him on there, then.  Hey, what did Adam Carolla do?  I've been out of it for three days.  Adam Carolla...  Said women aren't funny.  That old gag?  Yeah.  Well, he didn't say women aren't funny.  And he did preface it by saying there are plenty of funny women.  Right.  But they're just not as funny as guys.  He said there's...  But he wasn't even saying that about the funny women. 
[00:31:00]  Why is everyone outraged then?  Because they're babies.  That sounds like an honest opinion.  This is the day and age of the funny chicks.  But he's trending on Twitter over this?  Oh, yeah.  People are very mad.  This is the day and age of the funny chick.  All the...  A lot of TV series are put out now where it's the girl is the lead and they're funny and  they're usually comics and stuff.  Girls on HBO.  Girls on HBO.  Things like that.  And then Twitter is just a light with girls that are hot or semi-hot and just write about 
[00:31:30]  their fucking pussies and assholes and how they suck dick and guys come in their face.  And all this shit.  But if you talk to them one-on-one away from Twitter, they'd be horrified if you said anything  like that to them.  Okay.  They're like these hot, filthy girls talking about their duty in toilet bowls and stuff.  And it's like, oh, really?  Let's have a real conversation like that then.  And the second you bring it up, they'd be like, ugh. 
[00:32:00]  Ugh.  So I'm not completely against what Adam Carolla said.  And he did preface it.  He brought up a lot of comics.  And he said women comedy writers, too, he said.  He pointed out quite a few that were very funny, very good.  So where was this?  On his podcast?  Mow.  In an article?  Mow.  Huh?  Newspaper article.  New York Post.  So what was the line that got him in trouble?  Women aren't funny.  He said something about how the guys were always funnier on staff than the chicks were. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  And he said something like, if he has a daughter who has a, if my daughter has a mediocre sense  of humor, I'm just going to tell her, be a staff writer for a sitcom because they'll have to hire you.  They can't really fire you and you don't have to produce that much.  It'll be awesome.  You know what?  That's a great statement.  I'm pretty honest and pretty real.  You can't be honest.  He said, when you're picking a basketball team, you'll take the brother over the guy with the,  I don't even know how to pronounce it, but it's a Jewish thing. 
[00:33:00]  Why?  Because you're playing the odds.  When it comes to comedy, of course there's Sarah Silverman, Tina Fey, Kathy Griffin, super funny chicks.  But if you're playing the odds, no.  If Joy Behar or Sherry Shepard was a dude, they'd be off TV.  They're not funny enough for dudes.  What if Roseanne Barr was a dude?  Think we'd know who she was, honestly?  You know what?  Sherry Shepard stinks.  Yeah, I like Joy, but Sherry does stink.  Hold on, but let me say this about Joy.  She holds back.  I know she's funnier than what she does on TV.  Yeah. 
[00:33:30]  We've all seen her stand up.  She's very edgy.  Right?  And she defends comedians.  Right.  Yeah.  I mean, she doesn't stink like Sherry Shepard.  Is she a comic Sherry Shepard?  I guess.  She does.  She's a beach ball, man.  She works out of my gym.  She's horrendous.  She's a beach ball with thin legs.  It's really strange.  That's such an odd thing.  And with Adam Carolla, I'll say this.  For many years, I would have said women aren't funny.  Now I think some women are funny.  Yeah.  Well, now, especially with the social media, you get to see a little example of some of 
[00:34:00]  these and a few are very funny, but other ones are just so forced and ridiculous.  When I go to Caroline's and then there's a female comic, lately, I've been pleasantly  surprised by female comics.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  But there was a period there.  They all were doing the exact same material.  Same fucking act.  Yeah.  It was unbelievable.  Yeah.  I was talking to a female comic yesterday about this thing.  And I think part of it is as guys, you're raised to believe that it's like, you know,  we're all raised with bullshit. 
[00:34:30]  Like women supposed to say no when they mean yes.  Guys are always supposed to want to have sex, even if we don't.  So it's like we have these roles.  And being funny is considered being the class cut up or a goofball or an ass is considered  like a male badge of honor.  Yeah.  Where with women, it's more being compassionate or like you're out with a bunch of friends.  Somebody falls and cracks their head on the ice.  9 out of 10 of your guy friends are going to laugh.  Mm-hmm.  Whereas 9 out of 10 of the women you know are going to go over and go, oh my god.  Right.  Like that's just their instinctive reaction or what they're taught. 
[00:35:00]  Right.  Yeah.  So being funny is kind of, it's always been rewarded more being a guy.  I think a lot of that's changed in the last 20 years, which is probably why you're  seeing a lot more funny female comics because they're not holding back anymore.  But like women don't talk as much about, like people don't talk about their periods  because that to them was being revealing on stage.  Right.  Half the times they didn't talk about really wanting to fuck because then every guy in  the room is going to want to fuck them and every comic is going to want to fuck them.  So even open comics kept that part of themselves quiet.  Yeah. 
[00:35:30]  So I think now a lot of them are, like Bonnie is hilarious because she'll talk about anything.  The comics he's talking about will just talk about anything.  Bonnie, Eileen Wuornos.  That's what makes them funny.  That's what makes them funny.  What's that?  Eileen Wuornos was hilarious.  And we all could come up with a list of female comics we like.  Yeah.  That are hilarious.  Like the ones that are funny.  Throw Amy Schumer in there, Bonnie in there.  Chelsea is great.  Chelsea is hilarious.  The ones that are funny shouldn't be offended by a statement like that because they're the  funny ones.  Oh, God.  That's all that was about though. 
[00:36:00]  Chelsea's fucking hilarious, man.  Not that Chelsea.  Chelsea Peretti said something in Voss' documentary, which was kind of true, like why this annoys  women.  She's like, that'd be like, you know, she's like, you're just asking if a whole gender  is funny.  She's like, if there's a documentary like, are blacks as whatever, as smart as whites or  as this as white, like people would be bothered by that.  Yeah.  But if you say, are women just as funny, people are totally...  Yeah.  It's like, yeah, I guess that would annoy me if I was a woman in a comic.  Yeah, perhaps.  Sure, if I had a vag, I might be annoyed by that.  Yeah.  And Jimmy constantly trying to fuck me. 
[00:36:30]  But that's it for Adam Carolla.  Yeah.  I think he just expressed his opinion.  Who cares?  Good for him, man.  He got a nice, nice big splash of press over this.  Yeah.  Nothing's going to happen to the guy.  No.  Because he's got his podcast.  He never says he's sorry.  He didn't fuck into the Asian groups.  Yeah.  He doesn't give a fuck.  I do like that about him.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  Fuck him all.  Fuck him.  All right.  Yeah.  That's like, I don't know.  I agree with him.  I think we all do.  I think it's gotten better, though. 
[00:37:00]  I just got a text from Tom Papa.  Who's the comic?  I need to know.  I'm sitting at the gate.  It's not Tom Papa.  It's the Tom Papa rule.  Sorry, Tom.  It's the Tom Papa rule.  I sent him the name, regrettably.  Yeah.  I shouldn't have.  I regret not making up a name.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Goddamn me.  Oh, man.  We can only wish that he has a long flight ahead of him.  Yeah.  I sent him like a pussy.  You didn't give him the answer.  I'm fucking great, man.  Yeah. 
[00:37:30]  I like Tom Papa.  Yes, he's very funny.  He's fucking murders on stage.  It really annoys me.  Yeah.  Yeah, because he's very clean.  And it's like, I watch his acts like he could perform anywhere.  Yeah.  Anywhere.  And kill.  Isn't that annoying?  Yeah.  And be funny in the corporate.  Hate that.  You know who died overnight, man?  You're kidding.  Leroy, the painter there.  How do you say his last name?  Oh, Nivens.  Is it Nivens or?  Oh, Neiman.  Neiman.  Sorry.  He's done all the Rocky movies.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, he made those Rocky posters and paintings in the Rocky movies. 
[00:38:00]  That guy's been alive forever.  He's the guy with the big, long mustache, gray mustache.  That goes from side to side.  It's like completely straight across his face.  Yeah.  Like he should curl it up like Mr. Roberts, but he doesn't.  No.  He just went straight out.  Leroy Neiman.  He was 91.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah, the younger generations don't really know who he is.  When we were growing up, his shit was everywhere.  Do you remember?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah.  It was everywhere.  People had posters of this guy in their rooms. 
[00:38:30]  Dude, could you fuck me?  His artwork.  You know what that artwork is right now?  You know, like just in one day, it just increased in value.  Do you remember we sat next to him at the...  A roast.  Pat Cooper's roast.  Yeah.  And the whole time, he couldn't help himself.  He was just picking up napkins and I...  He was doodling.  He was just doodling the entire time.  Every time a comic went up to roast Pat Cooper, he's doing his doodling.  I wanted to grab one so bad.  So bad. 
[00:39:00]  Same here.  Yeah.  So what do you want to do?  Pawn it or sell it?  It's my Leroy Neiman doodle napkin that I got.  If this is actually Leroy Neiman's, the price could be through the roof.  And then he's like, all right, I'll give you...  You know, it is just a napkin.  And napkins aren't really selling.  Ah, 10 bucks.  But I wanted 2,000.  All right, I'll take 10.  It's gotta be Seinfeld.  Oh, no, no.  That's Pawn Stars.  Pawn Stars.  That show Pawn Stars where they pawn things. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, that's how they would have done it on Pawn Stars.  And the guy rips everybody off.  Right.  They just rip everybody off.  I still don't watch Pawn Stars.  It's like, why don't you put her on eBay, dummy?  But yeah, he died in 91.  He was smoking cigars right to the end, too.  Right to the end.  Right to the end.  He was sick in the last few years, the paper said.  He died of, I've had enough of this shit.  Enough, all right?  I was old in Rocky.  Rocky 1, I was old.  What age do you...  What's the age where you finally go, all right, I've had it, enough already? 
[00:40:00]  Where you actually look forward to dying?  What number would you hit?  Let's say you're of average health at that age.  But you're not like completely sick where you just want to fucking, you know, whatever age it is.  I would think when you finally hit 90, it's done.  Where you're like, I am so okay with this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But it could be...  You think it has to be 90, though?  It could be a lot earlier if you're sick.  I mean, I mean, you know what I mean? 
[00:40:30]  Right.  But if you're the average health you should be at 90, then it's just the years are probably like, all right, enough.  They just keep ticking by.  Same fucking Christmas.  How many funerals can I go to?  Right, right, right.  You're just like, ah, blah, blah, please.  My dad started getting older.  Like, what was sad was he finally had a conversation with me.  He's like, everyone I know is just dying around me.  I'm just like, oh, God.  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  Jesus.  He was going to a fucking Waker funeral once every other week.  Yeah.  He was like, enough of this shit.  It's really sad, but you do feel like you're...  I just wonder if you do finally get to an age where you're totally, completely at peace with it.  Yeah.  Like, yeah, man, I know these are extra days, but I'm ready now.  I think so.  Like an Indian.  Like an Indian.  Yeah.  Like, you know, an old Indian.  It is a good day to die.  They just don't care about it.  Yeah.  You feel like you're living past people. 
[00:41:30]  There is something kind of like you're making it past them.  It's like you feel like you're just...  I don't know what it is.  But even when I know in my age group, people that die and you go beyond them, you kind  of feel like, all right, well, I'm on borrowed time.  Oh, man.  I'm sure when you're really old, you think that.  Not...  But I mean in a grateful way.  Right.  Like, fuck, man.  It's like, wow, you can drop dead.  It stinks.  Yeah.  It's like, why not enjoy...  You know, if you're fucking 90, you might be like, what the fuck?  Maybe that's not the attitude you have.  No, probably not.  You're shitting yourself.  I saw a lady, she had the classic Walker. 
[00:42:00]  She was on the streets of New York.  Tennis balls on the back?  The Walker?  I...  Yes.  Matter of fact, I believe you're...  Yellow tennis balls look silly.  She was so old, she had the bend over.  Ah.  And my wife goes, ah, good for her.  And I go, good for her.  She's fucking smoking.  Oh.  She was smoking.  This lady had to be well into her 80s with a walker on the streets of New York smoking  a cigarette.  And then my wife goes, she might as well just do fucking heroin at that age.  Who gives a fuck she's smoking? 
[00:42:30]  If she quit smoking, she'd probably drop dead.  You think?  That's like, the body just gets used to things, I think, at that age.  Because your body will go, what the...  Yeah.  Where's my nicotine?  Come on.  You're killing me.  Dave from Connecticut, when you get married, you die faster.  Yeah.  Great.  An old marriage joke.  Ah, yes.  Ah, the old sperm bank.  You guys want to do the bus driver lady?  Before break?  She ain't the driver.  I haven't seen it.  She's the aide.  I've only heard about this, to be completely honest with you, but I hear it's brutal. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  She's a bus aide.  Making the bus monitor cry.  She's the monitor.  A bus monitor.  A bunch of kids in there.  She's just some fucking, you know, rotund old lady.  It's a school district, just gives her a little part-time job.  Yep.  So she feels good about herself, and then what, you got some dick-ass kids beating her  up?  She just had her 50th high school reunion.  She's lived in the same town, same school district all her life, and she's been a widow 
[00:43:30]  for the last 17 years.  Oh.  And where is this?  Greece, New York.  Oh, Greece, New York!  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Here.  Oh, I thought it was the country.  I'm like, why are they speaking English?  No, Greece is a suburb of Rochester.  Oh.  Yeah, the Weez people sent this to me.  Greece, New York.  Yeah, yeah.  Alright, let's play a little of it.  Yeah.  How long is this video?  Ten minutes.  Oh, we're going to have to play every single minute of it.  They're very mean to her.  It's a relentless ten minutes.  Yeah. 
[00:44:00]  Really?  Absolutely unrelenting.  She's on the ropes the whole time.  There's no dead spots.  Nope.  Alright.  What's this?  I sweat just from you talking, you fat ass.  Oh my god, you're so fat.  I know.  You're so mean.  You're so mean.  You're so mean.  You're fucking fat ass.  You're fucking fat ass.  You're fucking fat ass.  You're fat. 
[00:44:30]  Holy shit.  You're so fat.  If I said fucking fat ass.  If I said fucking fat ass.  Iroch would run in.  I'm sorry Iroch.  I didn't mean it.  If I had said that to an adult at that age and it got back to my parents.  Oh my god.  No way.  It would be over.  Of course.  Would your father have yelled at you?  Oh my god.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  No respect.  Especially just right to her face like that?  Another two big things that my father was.  Self respect. 
[00:45:00]  Which I didn't even understand what it meant back then.  You gotta have self respect.  And I'm like.  I don't know the concept of that.  What are you talking about?  What does that even mean?  Self respect.  And the other one was like.  God damn common sense.  But I didn't understand what that meant.  But it seems like he didn't have common sense.  No.  No.  Or self respect.  Or self respect.  It was like.  It was one of those do as I say not as I do things. 
[00:45:30]  I hated that shit.  Dads pile on.  He would say god damn common sense.  It's like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With my brother especially.  He was like.  Joseph.  You got no god damn common sense.  That's great.  Have some god damn common sense all the time.  And I was like.  I don't know what that means.  That's great.  It was a word.  Like you might as well just gone.  I didn't know what the fuck common sense was.  And self respect.  Like what is self respect.  Like what is self respect.  Jesus Christ.  Have some god damn common sense and self respect. 
[00:46:00]  Just a bunch of catchphrases my dad.  Funny though.  He was the catchphrase kid.  Oh catchphrase kid.  Uh.  Let's uh.  Listen to more of this.  God.  They're like five feet in front of her.  Oh no.  Put those sunglasses.  Oh my god.  Your glasses off.  Peggy from your.  Freaking sweat.  You fat ass.  Dude.  Put those sunglasses back on.  I can't stand looking at your face.  If you fucking look into our eyes.  You're going to turn into stone.  Jared.  Put those sunglasses back on. 
[00:46:30]  Freaking looking like a troll.  You fucking fat ass.  Look at all this.  Flab right here.  They're pointing at her belly.  Besides your shirt.  Unless you have something nice to say.  Don't say anything.  How about you shut the fuck up.  These are.  There's government.  Pause.  Holy shit.  Why don't you shut the fuck up.  Yeah.  I kind of agree with them.  Could she stop speaking in cliches.  I know right.  If you don't have anything to.  A bird in the hand.  Is worth two in the bush.  Shut up.  They pointed at her belly. 
[00:47:00]  And said look at all this flab right here.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Freaking.  Scrawl your breath.  Oh no bad.  I know.  Look at her fucking ugly ass ears.  Fucking corny all of them.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  You can fucking see the sweat.  You can fucking see the sweat. 
[00:47:30]  ripping down her face.  I know.  Look at that ass.  Karen.  Are you sweating?  Karen.  Karen.  Are you sweating?  I'm not sweating.  Why is there water on your face?  She's just.  Trying to sit there.  Are you crying over your eyes?  You dumbass?  Yeah.  You're crying right here.  I'm crying all over.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She probably misses her box of her Twinkies.  That's true.  That's true.  Yeah.  That's true.  It's everything we say to Bob Kelly when he's here though. 
[00:48:00]  Sure.  Do you miss your Twinkies?  Right.  Do you miss your Twinkies?  She probably freaking shoves the Twinkies up her ass.  Fuck.  And the bus driver doesn't know this is going on?  Yeah.  That sucks.  You got to get like.  Wait.  Are you really kidding me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Brandon, shut up.  Pause that for one second.  Do you know how much trouble these kids are in?  Oh.  With their families?  Oh yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Look at that kid's face is right there.  He's so fucked.  He is good.  I hope his father just fucking punches the side of his little face. 
[00:48:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Look at that kid's face is right there.  This idiot.  He's so fucked.  He is good.  I hope his father just fucking punches the side of his little face.  Oh.  God damn.  Well, I mean, but kids today know nothing's going to happen to them.  God damn common sense.  Yeah.  That's the problem.  Yeah.  They just know they're pervious.  And they all are taught bullying in school at this point.  Obviously that's not helping.  Well, it would be like, oh, I thought you meant each other.  Right.  Oh, the bullying of each other.  You mean anybody? 
[00:49:00]  Oh.  I didn't know.  I'm sorry.  I tapped out on this one.  I feel bad for this lady.  Oh, who wouldn't?  I don't even feel bad.  I fucking don't give a shit about anyone.  Tell that to this hard dick in the front of my pen.  You just know she just has a tiny little job at the school district.  She's just trying to stay active.  Right.  After her dead husband fucking leaves her and fucking her son committed suicide, by the  way.  After this video?  No.  Ten years ago. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, no.  I believe ten years ago.  And the kids are saying your family should kill themselves.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Terrible.  Do we know the backstory on this?  Yeah, she's fat.  Did this lady do horrific things to all these kids when they were younger?  I don't know.  It's payback time?  Isn't it fucked up?  I don't think so, but she's made over $100,000 on donations from people watching this.  Already?  Yeah.  Oh, these kids are in, what is it, a PayPal account?  Yeah, there's some website, you know, things on YouTube.  And there's a link to it. 
[00:50:00]  And then it's just donate to Karen to send her on vacation and help her retire.  Dude, I would take a beating like this for $100,000.  Oh, fuck yeah.  No fucking problem.  That's not a bunch of kids.  We do when we're sitting here.  Yeah, no problem.  Comics come in.  I feel like we owe E-Rock about a hundred grand.  Oh, man, right?  Sure, for lunch.  E-Rock, can you make-  That's so much food.  That's so much food.  Oh.  Let's hear more of it.  It's kind of hard to hear, but...  But why wouldn't you let me look at the book?  You want to look at it? 
[00:50:30]  Oh, this is her.  She's just asking the kids if she can look at their yearbook.  Oh.  She just wants to look at it.  She wants to look at the pictures.  She's trying to interact.  She's probably so lonely that this is like the only interaction she has with people.  And they're all fucking kids from Lord of the fucking Flies.  Jason on Long Island says the cops are stations outside the houses of these kids at this point.  Are they?  Really?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Why?  They're getting death threats?  Yeah, the kids are probably-  Especially this one idiot whose face is all over the video.  It's not good.  Oh, yeah, I betcha. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, no one wants you to touch your books, you deadass.  You just touched your freaking sweat, you dumbass.  Get the hell off, old ass.  What?  That Doc has a yearbook.  What?  Why don't you guys-  What the fuck up?  Look at this.  You guys, you want this?  You want to win?  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  She's just kind of laughing though at some point.  She's laughing like an elephant.  Maybe she is an elephant. 
[00:51:30]  She's like-  She's like-  Oh!  She'll probably sweat from that.  I don't want her to freaking touch my ear, but she's going to get her freaking sweat all over it.  I know.  She's probably going to get grease stains all over it.  Oh man.  She's going to pick out which kid she's going to rape next.  Holy shit.  Rape jokes.  You can watch.  Smush, smush.  Carrie, let's hurt me.  Oh wait.  You got one.  Carrie, you've hurt me.  I'm wrong with these kids.  Wait.  Oh boy. 
[00:52:00]  She's hurt me.  Oh wait.  Oh wait.  You got one.  Carrie, you've hurt me.  This is wrong with these kids.  Oh boy.  My leg is gonna hurt.  She's going to hurt.  Fucking hot.  Yeah.  Cause I saw some on the other one.  You just slunk it at her.  Fucking car he made.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're little like poking her.  No, I don't know.  I don't want to get a freaking egg your house.  You can get somebody and get a freaking house and prolly shit.  You had to live for a fucking trailer.  I know.  Listen easy.  All right.  We had to live for a fucking trailer.  What do you want, Karen? 
[00:52:30]  What's your address?  Like what neighborhood?  What's your address?  Oh, yeah, right.  Oh, yeah, right.  Where do you live by?  Where do you live by?  I would never talk about it.  What's your address so I can freaking piss all over your door?  Holy shit.  I'm gonna fucking take a crack in your mouth.  I'm gonna, I'm gonna when you know I'm freaking coming in your mouth.  Holy shit.  What was that?  The guy's gonna take a crack in her mouth.  And the other guy's gonna come in her mouth.  Which one happens first? 
[00:53:00]  It's like, I, I wouldn't even.  People are pissed on Twitter right now.  I wouldn't even have known that shit.  Like to say come in your mouth.  I like, uh.  It's crazy.  Mayor Angel looks like, or Angel, I don't know.  This video is the result of the no consequence ultra PC entitlement society we're raising our kids in.  Ridiculous.  Brilliant.  Part of it, but also part of it is kids just suck and they've always sucked.  Well, they've always sucked, but now they also know there's no consequences.  There would have been.  These kids are going home and their parents aren't gonna do anything about this. 
[00:53:30]  Kids sucked and always sucked, but there is no fucking way.  If a kid talked like that to an adult and especially, you know, she's technically an authority figure on the bus.  Right.  Uh, you, if, if the kid said like, fuck you, that would, you'd look at that kid and he'd be labeled the psychopath of, of school.  Well, also either she or the bus, excuse me, bus driver would have beat the shit out of some of these kids.  Yeah, yeah.  When we were growing up.  Smacked in the mouth.  The, the bus driver probably, probably would have punched in the face of this.  Smack, like an open hand smack in the mouth. 
[00:54:00]  Right.  Now you fucking apologize.  But then it would be her problem if she, you know, touched the kids.  Nowadays, back, back in the day, the parent would have been like, yeah, why'd she smack you?  Yeah.  Oh, well, I'll tell you why.  He was saying, fuck you to the monitor.  Oh, good.  Now I'm gonna smack you too.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Goddamn common sense.  What's gonna happen to these kids?  Their parents take away their Xbox or something?  Expelled from school.  You think expulsion?  For this one?  This is not one run. 
[00:54:30]  This is a 10 minute brutal assault.  Oh yeah, they're expelled.  You think the school will be able to get that done?  Absolutely.  All right, I hope so.  Yeah, especially with the poking.  This is like a really weird group menacing.  Right.  Absolutely.  Yeah, it's like a wolf pack.  They'll get expelled for this.  If you had just said one or two things, but we're on, we're five minutes into this.  I would love to know what the parents did when these kids got home.  I would love to know, but obviously that's never gonna get out.  The kid who's leaning in kind of looks almost like Mongolian or Asian.  Like, he doesn't look like a traditional little white kid. 
[00:55:00]  He might have those parents that fucking still believe in really smashing you.  In fucking, like, those honor killings.  They're gonna beat his head in with a rock.  He's definitely Asian.  His name's Tang.  Oh, Tang?  Tang.  Uh-oh.  Aw.  Shit.  Conway Tweety, with a K, he writes, these kids are fucked.  Anonymous has put their family's addresses and phone numbers all over the internet.  Conway Tweety?  Is that really necessary?  I mean...  Anonymous doesn't play. 
[00:55:30]  No.  Anonymous doesn't play.  Why does Anonymous care about a bunch of...  How old are they?  12?  Yeah, between 12 and 15.  But it's also like, yeah, they're families.  Like, why would you fuck with their families?  Like, for really?  Because their families seem pretty shitty.  I agree.  I agree with whatever Anonymous does.  And you're right.  You're right.  I'm all in with Anonymous.  Wonderful group.  Abso-fucking-living, man.  That's all I'm saying.  That's all for me.  Have fun, Jimmy.  Enjoy Anonymous.  Just give it to a bunch of 12-year-olds. 
[00:56:00]  I usually back those guys when they're doing certain things, but this one's like, come  on, guys.  What are you doing?  Because they're a bunch of douchey 12-year-olds, are you going to put their families in danger?  I just feel bad for this lady, man.  She's an older lady, completely out of shape, lost her husband, lost her son, just trying  to find a little purpose in life, and you got these assholes just poking, literally poking  at her fucking flab.  Something to occupy her mind aside from her dead husband and her dead son.  Oh, man.  Feeling a little self-worth, just riding the bus. 
[00:56:30]  I'm doing something.  Hoping that she can bond with the kids a little bit.  Making a difference in a child's life.  That's what she's doing.  She lost her own child, so she's like, maybe I can bond with some of these kids to fill  that empty void deep inside me.  Oh, man.  Holy fuck.  Oh, this poor woman.  These kids stink.  Push play.  I'm like, shit in a brown bag of light on the fire and throw it out.  Really, Chip?  Young Chip? 
[00:57:00]  Carrot.  Carrot.  FedEx.  I'm Clem.  Hey, Charity.  They're hitting her arm flab.  They're poking her with the yearbook.  They're poking her with the yearbook.  Fucking jiggle.  Wesley, why would you touch her?  Touching her fat, making it jiggle. 
[00:57:30]  He touched you.  That was John.  No, it wasn't.  If we could just touch her arm flab.  Something tells me she's...  All right, pause a minute again.  Something tells me she's not completely against this.  Believe it or not.  She's, like, smirking at some point.  Like, she might be one of these weird fucking people that kind of enjoy that...  She's just trying to be...  Any interaction.  She's trying to, you know, be a part of whatever's going on.  Because I see her, like, they poked her with the yearbook and she turned really quick and  kind of smirked, like...  Maybe she's trying to be cool. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, one of the fucking...  One of the cool people.  Well, obviously the kids knew they could get away with this.  Yeah.  You're not going to do it with the tough teacher.  Yeah.  I don't know how you fucking teach in this day and age.  But these little douches really don't take consequences.  I mean, that's true.  They really don't.  No.  No one's going to have to worry about their father slapping them in the face.  I would get my fucking face slapped.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I've gotten hit for a lot less.  Oh, yeah.  It would have been ugly.  Oh, yeah.  For talking during Ronan Martin's laughing. 
[00:58:30]  Fucking, I've gotten a belt across my ass for that one.  Who are you, Ronnie Kovic?  Oh, it's the Sammy Davis episode.  What could you have possibly done wrong?  I was making too much noise during Ronan Martin's laughing.  But what was going on?  I don't know.  I think it was the Fickle Finger of Fate Award.  It's a very, very important programming.  And, uh...  Want to play more of this?  You bet you're bippy.  All right.  I know, this looks infected, though.  Here, do you put, like, a little time of deodorant on your arm? 
[00:59:00]  She might fucking eat deodorant because she can't afford real food.  What are we doing?  Your mom.  Oh, well, he's dead.  Kind of like you in a few years, you old ass.  She's gonna die of fucking diabetes because she's so damn crazy.  Here, why don't you take everybody else's picture?  I hope you don't do that.  I hope you don't do that.  Fake gold.  Yeah, no.  Fake gold, that's fucking plastic.  No.  What do you want? 
[00:59:30]  What do you want?  No, bitch.  Oh, my God.  You're such a fucking troll.  What size bar are you?  Triple E?  Triple Zag?  What size bar are you?  Triple Zag?  Triple Zag.  Triple Zag.  That was it.  What's in front of your stomach?  What are you like?  You're fucking...  What?  You're a troll.  You're a troll.  A troll?  You're a troll. 
[01:00:00]  You old troll.  You've seen...  You ever seen...  Oh, you did it.  Oh.  Pull it out.  Pull it out.  How about I bring my name and fucking punch you?  What's she trying to pull out?  I think she's got a little Swiss army knife.  She didn't actually take the blade out or anything.  She'll probably now be sued and fucking fired.  Oh, yeah.  No medicine him with a knife.  Where's the bus driver in this whole thing?  He might not even hear it.  Probably at the front of the bus.  You think she's in the back, you think? 
[01:00:30]  Maybe he takes care of the front of the bus and she's more in the back?  I think she's in the middle somewhere.  I see an emergency exit on the window.  Because they're not yelling, so it probably sounds like normal bus chatter.  Because no one's yelling and she's not yelling.  That's true.  So it's just like normal bullshit.  Someone writes, why didn't they get kicked off the bus?  Are you kidding me?  The bus driver would be screwed.  Kick the kid off the bus.  They have to walk fucking a block home and they all get fired.  You're right.  Yeah.  Dude, I'm going to fucking step on my knife right there. 
[01:01:00]  If I stand back.  I'm all right, my Nana.  If I stand you in the stomach and fucking my knife can go through you like butter.  It's all fucking water.  I'm going to cut you all this presents.  I'm going to cut you like the whole value of me is going to be coming out of McDonald's.  It's so mean.  It's going to be fucking Big Macs flying out of your stomach.  It's going to be like, oh, with the chance of me boss. 
[01:01:30]  Never see that.  Oh, they were the chance of me boss.  Oh, shit.  Nobody's going to have food because she's still going to be ordering.  That's why Haiti can't form us for more of you to get.  Guys, cover your mouth and talk to her.  She gets pissed off.  Here, what is Chris saying?  Glass, love, love.  Cover your mouth and talk to her.  She gets pissed off.  They know that.  They're like, cover your mouth and talk to her.  She gets pissed off.  What if she has bad ears?  Yeah, she had a hearing aid.  They were making fun of her hearing aid before.  Oh, her hearing aid.  Oh, okay.  That must be it.  She's got a hearing aid on top of it. 
[01:02:00]  This woman's a disaster area.  I know.  Holy shit.  That purse probably cost you like fucking $5.  Karen, how much was that purse?  What's in it?  How much was it?  How much money?  I know.  I heard you.  How much?  Why do you want to know?  Because I want to buy it.  Because I want to know.  Yeah, right.  I want to buy it for my mom.  I want to know how poor you are.  My mom's an asshole.  I bought it at Wegmans. 
[01:02:30]  What a fucking poor ass.  Oh my god.  You bought it at Wegmans.  You're so poor.  You gave my purse at Wegmans.  You're so poor.  The kid goes.  What happened to your plastic bag purse?  Porter, I love when that big dummy just pipes in.  Yeah, with his fucking already low voice.  Dummy.  The McDonald's gonna fall out.  What happened?  He's the unfunny guy who'll just pipe in.  It's like a big lug.  Yeah.  Big dummy.  She's trying to be a good sport about it.  You can see that.  Yeah, but it's just too much.  That's way too much.  I'm surprised you can even pull up your fat ass. 
[01:03:00]  Does that make you sweat when you pick up your purse?  Oh.  I tried to look fat.  What?  Some of these words.  Yeah, but you don't.  I tried, but it's very hard.  Hey, is the word fat on there?  Because that's what you look by.  Fuck.  It's fat.  I mean, it's ugly on there.  It's fat moving.  You live. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, I know.  You live with integrity.  You're so fucking old.  This is like them at the cellar.  Live with integrity.  Surprise, you know how the rain is.  Oh my God, that bracelet's gonna break off your wrist because you're fucking flabbering.  I know, right?  That bracelet's fucking horrible.  Nobody cares about what that freaking city's worth doing.  I know.  It's relentless.  It's a dream.  Okay, everybody does that. 
[01:04:00]  Dare to laugh.  Fat ass.  Oh wait, that is...  It just doesn't sound.  Be remarkable.  You already are remarkable by fucking taking up a whole entire scene.  Fuck.  Fat ass.  You're a remarkable medic.  You're gifted to be the fattest one ever.  You're a fucking troll, Garrett.  The guy's bombing.  The deep voice guy's just bombing.  Why are you looking at me like that?  You want to rape me?  Holy shit.  I know where all you guys are looking at me.  Yeah, cool.  What are you gonna do? 
[01:04:30]  You're gonna bomb the right house and I'll fucking beat your ass.  I know.  I'll fucking tell my people to eat your fat ass.  Of course.  You're gonna get my little short ass.  What is he saying?  I'll tell my people to eat your ass.  He stinks, this kid.  Yeah.  Did she say I try to look nice or something?  She said I try to live my life by these words.  By these words.  He said it's one of the words.  Is it fat or something?  Dare to laugh.  Yeah, one of the words.  Fat.  And she's like, I know where you guys live. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, come over.  I'll kick your ass.  It's just about over.  I'll send you a fucking McDonald's coupon.  It'll be like two cents off.  You can pay your rent.  You can pay your rent to your fucking box.  Karen, did you get that personal layaway? 
[01:05:30]  Nah, she got it.  He's just bombing.  Oh, he sucks.  You probably got that from Dollar Tree.  A fucking family dollar.  But you don't have a family because they all killed themselves because they didn't want  to be near you.  Why are you looking at me like that?  Like, you want to fucking...  That one, you just got your real fat.  And her son killed himself?  Her son did kill himself, yeah.  Why did the video stop there?  It's where it ended.  Yeah, maybe the kids ran out of tape.  Or maybe he had to get up.  Or get out of leave.  Yeah.  But the best part is that fucking big lunk just bombing. 
[01:06:00]  He's bombing.  He's terrible.  You get that on layaway.  You put that pace on layaway.  Layaway.  Yeah.  My pit bull.  My pit bull.  Eat your ass.  That's horrible.  So what's the story today?  Words hurt.  Douchebags.  Man.  I mean, their names are all over the place because whoever put this on YouTube got it  off their Facebooks and stuff.  Oh, is that how it got on YouTube?  Yeah.  So they find the Facebook, find the friends.  Right.  And everything else.  Yeah, but you would think the kids themselves would have put this on YouTube.  That they were so proud of themselves. 
[01:06:30]  They probably put it on Facebook.  What dummies.  It's just what, but that is people who don't realize, to not realize you're going to get  fucked for this.  Oh, man.  There's no consequences.  At all.  Yep.  There's none.  Let's see their names.  There's none.  What the fuck could possibly happen to these kids?  Students involved?  Maybe get expelled?  They sound spoiled.  Well, Luis, Wesley, Brandon, and Joshua.  I mean, they're going to have a terrible time for, at least until the news cycle ends. 
[01:07:00]  With who?  Whoever's around them.  They're not going to be able to leave their houses.  Everybody hates them.  They're probably heroes at their school, though.  That's the problem.  No, they won't be heroes.  Because everybody's going to hate them.  Yeah.  Their fellow students are going to hate them?  I doubt it.  Yeah.  I doubt it.  I don't know.  A small percentage, maybe.  Maybe.  What are some of the comments?  Are there any good comments?  Yeah, they're all just like...  Is anybody for them?  No.  These kids rule.  These kids rule.  Yeah.  Jesus.  These kids rule.  They're real young go-getters. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Well, it's just...  I'm not surprised.  No, no.  I would have had some good ones for that lady.  I would have been like, you cut it so fat, you look like you got your own zip code or something.  That's a good one.  Thanks.  Leave it alone.  Yeah, that's a great one.  We should break.  We can read the comments and all that a little later, but...  Oh, Billy Corrigan's in 10 minutes.  Yeah, we got to set up for Billy Corrigan from, of course, the Smashing Pumpkins. 
[01:08:00]  New album out called Oceania.  Very good.  Oceania, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Wow.  I mean, people want to talk about it on the phones.  You got the comments.  You got the Twitter, but we got a break here.  Yes.  We can go back to this thing a little later.  Certainly.  All right.  You're listening to the...  You're listening to the...  The Opie and Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  New from Grody Publishing comes the audiobook, So Erotic, it will make you question everything. 
[01:08:30]  Damn, that's a good book on tape.  The best-selling cultural phenomenon evolves just for men.  It's Fifty Shades of Gay.  The muscles inside the deepest, darkest part of me clench in the most delicious fashion.  Club Soda Kenny takes you on a journey you've only been to in your deepest fantasies. 
[01:09:00]  Suck me, baby.  Millions of red-blooded men have gotten rigid over the excitement of Fifty Shades of Gay.  Bro, I've tasted my cum?  After hearing Fifty Shades of Gay, I would totally be down for tasting someone else's.  Or whatever.  I'm a quivering, moist mess, and he hasn't even touched me.  I've always been a guy that's, like, totally into chicks with tits and stuff like that.  But you know what?  This book is frickin' hot as shit.  Holy fuck. 
[01:09:30]  This is wrong.  But holy hell, is it erotic.  For the first time, I'm sexually attracted to something that isn't available at the deli counter.  My insides practically contort with potent, needy, liquid desire.  Ooh, I don't fuck guys, man.  But I'll jack off to this, man.  Damn!  The experts agree Fifty Shades of Gay is a must-listen.  Hello, I'm Dr. Gay.  This audiobook is a must-listen for any man looking to further a healthy sex life. 
[01:10:00]  I'm erect.  Fifty Shades of Gay.  If you're not turned on now, you will be.  Yum.  The Opinion Tree Show.  Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down.  I think you only live to see the lights uptown. 
[01:10:30]  I wasted my time when I would try, try, try.  Cause when the lights have lost the glow, you cry, cry, cry.  I guess Johnny Carson, I almost said it.  Now I did say it.  I guess Johnny Cash did something on this date.  E-Rock.  Good morning.  Oh, he's waiting for his bit.  We haven't been doing his bit.  No, I'm like, he's all excited.  Oh, that his bit is back?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, you're gonna cry, cry, cry. 
[01:11:00]  You're gonna cry, cry, cry.  Fucking Johnny Cash rules.  So, Johnny Carson.  People are going, Johnny Carson!  I guess he died a few years ago today or something?  Yeah, what happened?  What happened?  This is his first single, and it was released 57 years ago.  Oh, God.  Gives a shit.  You like Johnny Cash, Ant?  No.  No.  Come on, Ant.  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  I still don't like him. 
[01:11:30]  I can almost understand Bob Dylan, but Johnny Cash?  No, there are a few Johnny Cash songs that I like, but for the most part...  Ring of Fire.  Yeah, I like Ring of Fire, of course.  You don't like Ghost Rider in the Sky?  Yeah, I kind of like that.  Yeah, how do you not?  Yeah, yeah.  I know you don't like Rusty Cage or...  Yeah, I don't like his old man stuff.  What happened?  He got caught his...  He got caught his cheese on your wiener.  Scooping the banana out, and a nice hunk of banana fell onto my black sweatpants and rolled on the floor.  And then he just yells, cock! 
[01:12:00]  He got all angry.  I saw it happening.  I tried to stop.  Please don't make me laugh too hard.  Oh my God.  Look at me, I'm a fucking disaster.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Cry, cry.  Is Everclear good?  Is Everclear good?  They're still a big band or no?  What?  What year is this?  They were all right.  I wasn't a big fan of Everclear.  No, they did have a couple of hits.  A couple of hits I liked.  Whatever.  Why?  They're the band on The Tonight Show tomorrow. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, oops.  Sorry.  No, I don't care.  I've never met them.  Hey, they got new stuff out.  Is it good?  It must be good.  Why would it must be good?  Because they put a new album out?  Well, if they're on Leno, there's a lot of bands from that era that they're not getting  the big invite.  They're doing a tour with Sugar Ray and Marcy's Playground.  It's Marcy Playground.  Marcy Playground, sorry.  Not Marcy's Playground.  I like Marcy's Playground.  Now all the Marcy Playground fans are going to be tweeting me. 
[01:13:00]  She looks good today.  All five of them?  Yeah.  Oh, God damn.  What's her name?  What?  What happened?  The girl on TV was...  The one from the Fox Business Channel.  She looks really good today.  She did something with her hair or something.  But she probably got an email from the...  Oh, from...  Invoking some rule about hair on the show.  Yeah, well, you know, as long as your hair looks good, you can get on this program.  What's going on with our show and the 90s bands?  We got any invites yet?  I think we're getting Everclear. 
[01:13:30]  I think we're getting Marcy Playground.  I think we're getting Gin Blossoms.  Gin Blossoms?  Are they going to play, though?  Yes.  They have to.  If they don't play, fuck them.  They know the deal.  They have to.  Next month, I think they're in town.  We're getting Billy Corgan, too.  When?  Billy Corgan is on his way up.  But we don't know about him playing, right?  That's not confirmed.  See?  But he's going to be in the building.  Oh, boy.  Fucking Billy Corgan is a genius.  I do want to say that. 
[01:14:00]  Because of the great music he made?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Melancholy and the Infinite Sadness is one of the best records.  I don't know any of the...  What's the big song by them?  I used to be a little boy!  I guarantee you know at least five Smashing Pumpkins songs.  Well, we'll play them.  You rock.  Eric.  Fucking riding there with fantasy wrestling stuff.  How about Tonight?  Tonight, Tonight.  Tonight, Tonight.  Zero.  Bullet with Butterfly Wings.  How about...  Yeah.  1979.  This album was huge. 
[01:14:30]  Which is 95?  Jeez, I don't even know.  How about Despite All My Rage?  I'm still just a rat in the cage.  I sing these good...  And I love their version of Landslide.  Landslide's a great cover.  You know, like everything he's done.  And his deep shit is amazing, too.  I'm nervous.  I'll be honest.  Really?  Yeah, this one. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, this is very cool.  Billy Corgan's great.  I hear nothing but great things about his new CD.  Yeah, it's getting very good reviews.  Oceania.  And I'm saying CD because I got it in front of me as a CD.  So I can say that.  A real CD?  I got a real CD in front of me.  What is that?  Which is strange, right?  You thought CDs would be around forever.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was like the ultimate.  All right?  It's compact.  It's even in the name.  And you just pop it in the machine.  But I like albums.  Because, you know, the album cover art is lost now. 
[01:15:30]  Remember what people were saying?  That whole thing.  That was really...  Cassettes kind of put an end to that.  Vinyl record sales are up this year.  In this day and age, this is a...  Amongst hipster fucking assholes.  Final records.  Hipsters.  Stop it.  In this day and age, this is a giant picture.  Yeah.  Because now we're all looking at tiny little thumbnails and think,  Wow, look at that amazing picture on my phone.  Did you get a pork pie hat with a fucking vinyl album?  You guys, hipster shit.  I hate enough with vinyl.  I know, right?  Oh, there he is.  Oh. 
[01:16:00]  He's working his way in.  He's walking down the hall like a rock star.  He's walking down the hall like fucking Billy Corgan on the Opie and Anthony show.  Make yourself comfy.  Thank you.  Take a seat.  Guys like, what is this, travel day for you?  Yeah.  Going to L.A.  Probably got the same flight as Jimmy.  Jimmy's going out.  How you doing, man?  What is that, vodka?  You ever have this?  Vodka.  Oh, man.  It's great because this garbage water they give us.  You've got to drink high pH. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, high pH?  9.5 pH.  You've got to tell me what that does.  Are you making money off this, hopefully?  What's that?  Are you making money off this?  No, no.  You've got to tell me what that does.  You buy us waters and I can't take it on the plains.  Oh, right.  Yeah, of course not.  What does high pH do?  I thought he was promoting a water company.  If your system gets too acidic, it makes you cranky and it sort of opens the way for viruses  and stuff.  Then you know what?  I should drink a lot of this.  It's like your body runs better.  They are figuring out a lot of things to do to water.  To make people buy their water as opposed to another person's water. 
[01:17:00]  You want to be there or there?  Billy, I want to say that you're a genius and the reason is very simple.  You were able to get at Billy on Twitter.  That's amazing to me.  Yeah, yeah.  How did you get at Billy?  That's kind of rough.  You know, there's a lot of Billys out there.  Well, there was an at Billy Corgan.  Right.  Right.  So I wanted, but the guy who had at Billy Corgan was named Billy Corgan.  And he wouldn't give it to you?  No.  What an asshole.  Jesus.  So Twitter has some sort of weird policy. 
[01:17:30]  So they said, okay, they made him at not Billy Corgan.  Right.  I don't get what that means.  Okay.  And then in exchange, they said, well, I will give you at Billy.  Because it's something about they don't want to give me what he had.  Wait.  They changed his Twitter account.  To at not Billy Corgan.  But they wouldn't give you Billy Corgan.  No.  Why?  Isn't the name dead now?  No one can use it?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what they did.  So they gave me at Billy.  But they actually said, this is cool.  People beg for these.  That's an easy one.  But you're the number one Billy Corgan out there.  I'm sure there's other Billy Corgans. 
[01:18:00]  Well, what's kind of weird is I've got to imagine that a fan would go at Billy Corgan  and not find me.  Right.  Yeah.  But then I get everybody else going, you don't deserve at Billy.  Like you're not Cher.  Do they bring up other Billys that are more deserving?  Yeah, like Billy Idol.  Right.  Billy Joel, maybe.  Billy Holiday.  Billy.  Different spelling.  But you got at Billy.  I got at Billy.  That's pretty impressive.  It really is.  Why can't they just give you the name?  And somebody else I know had that happen and they just, they kill the name. 
[01:18:30]  They said no one gets it.  Stupid.  It didn't make any, why did they turn the guy into a hat, not Billy Corgan?  That just seems so funny.  He's probably like Billy Corgan, Chrysler Plymouth.  He runs that.  Right.  And it's like, oh, really?  I mean, there are people in this country named Billy Corgan.  No, I know.  If he was Billy Corgan, I'd say, okay, well, you got it first.  Right.  But it's safe to say you're the biggest Billy Corgan.  And then when it comes to Twitter and the social media crap, you should be Billy Corgan.  I don't get it. 
[01:19:00]  And here's a better one.  Facebook kicked me off for not being Billy Corgan.  Wait, what?  What?  How does that work?  Somebody reported me, right, and said, this is a fake Billy Corgan.  And Facebook shut down my account.  But you are.  Seized or froze my account and then sent me some bullshit thing saying, you got to prove who  you are.  Oh, my God.  So that's why I said.  Screw it.  Screw it.  Here's a video of me.  I know Sean Parker.  I mean, I could call somebody. 
[01:19:30]  Right.  And I thought.  It was a principle.  I don't want.  In fact, thanks for doing me a favor.  Right.  Wow.  I got the hell off Facebook and said, give me the hell away from this because.  You don't need it.  And then I go and look and there's like seven fake Billy Corgans pretending they're me.  That are still there.  We're trying to pick up chicks.  And they're still running.  They're still running.  Well, their stock isn't doing well, so.  No, no.  Rejoice in that.  No, they had a bump up, though.  I just bought again.  I fucking lost like five grand and I bought more back and now it's dropping again. 
[01:20:00]  I keep buying high.  I could have bought a bunch of AOL like 94, 95.  And my bandmates bought some and I'm thinking, oh, you guys are wasting your money.  Oh, yeah.  So I kind of feel that same feeling.  Like maybe I should jump in now.  You never know.  They're not going anywhere.  I don't know.  That seems to be a consensus.  You know how you know they aren't going anywhere?  Because they're hanging out with the political campaigns.  And the minute you start seeing that kind of backdoor stuff, they ain't going anywhere  any time soon.  Let's buy Facebook today.  At a point.  I don't know. 
[01:20:30]  What is AOL worth now, though?  Like Yahoo, do they go like way up and then drop?  I think they sit a lot of those.  Do you know what they bought in at?  It's got to be low.  75 bucks a share, maybe, is my memory?  But I mean, that's so long ago.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, damn, man.  $7.50.  Who uses AOL at this point?  No, but it was that moment.  No, that was.  Oh, okay.  It was internet training wheels.  Like everybody had that at first.  It was all you knew.  We all could have bought Apple stock.  Yeah.  We'd be bloody rich.  Oh, man. 
[01:21:00]  It went down to 80 bucks in 2008 when the fucking market shit the bed.  It went down to $80.  Yeah.  That would have been nice.  Now you're touching on 600.  I want to say I'm so glad you're doing our show.  Oh, thank you.  There was a little misunderstanding.  We don't have to get into it, but we're very happy you're here.  Because we're all massive fans.  Oh, thank you.  I'm happy to be here.  And I was sick all week, but I came back in just to say hi to you.  Oh, thank you.  Just to make you sick.  Just to make you sick for your trip.  What do you have in case I get it?  I'm good.  It is sweat, throat, congestion, crap.  But, you know, that wouldn't affect me at all as a professional. 
[01:21:30]  You stay over there.  I'm hearing nothing but good things about the new CD.  Oh, thank you.  Oceania.  I haven't heard it yet.  I literally got my copy this morning.  It's the first time I put out an album, I think, in 17 years that people like it.  Oh, man.  Right away.  You know what I mean?  Usually I get the seven years later.  Oh, that was actually pretty good.  I don't know what my problem was.  It grew on me.  It grew on me.  It's like, thanks.  Why is that, do you think?  I don't know.  Honestly, I don't believe me.  If I knew what people were thinking at this point. 
[01:22:00]  But you don't try to, do you try to write hits when you're putting an album together?  You know, back in the day, you knew you had to come up with that MTV type song.  Right.  But we never, you know, sit, I mean, if you look at the hit songs we had, it wasn't, you  know, it wasn't like we sat there and went with the formula.  We always try to come up with something fresh that felt really exciting.  I think hits usually means exciting.  Right.  So if we felt, oh, this is pretty exciting.  It was when I tried to maybe be a little more conservative and kind of just do music I  really liked. 
[01:22:30]  That's when it didn't go so well.  So exciting seems to work for me.  But isn't that okay with you?  What's that?  When you were getting more experimental and stuff?  Yeah, it was fine by me.  But it's kind of a weird thing.  It's like, one day you're a nobody.  Then you're a genius.  Then you're an idiot.  You know what I mean?  You know what I mean?  And as I've been saying to my friends, now I'm a genius again.  You know what I mean?  It's like, I'm the same guy the whole time.  Right.  I wonder what that is, though, that makes people like one thing that you do and then  just kind of not really pay attention to the other. 
[01:23:00]  Believe me, if they could quantify it in the music business, they would get rid of  people like me.  Because, you know, I'm too much of an X factor.  You know, they don't like that.  They don't know what you're going to...  All these other kids, they know what they're going to say.  They line them up and they march like robots.  I mean, people like me, I mean, who knows what I'm going to say or do.  And that's too risky for them.  Have you always been like that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Even at the beginning when...  Did you have to do a lot of compromising or did you do it your way?  Really?  No.  Wow.  We were lucky.  But I mean, look, I'll give you an example. 
[01:23:30]  89 were nobody playing, you know, college gig for 50 bucks.  This interviewer, you know, snobby kind of indie person.  Who are you guys' influences?  Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Cheap Trick.  Guy laughs at me.  Like, don't you realize that people don't like those bands?  I said, we don't fucking care.  That's what we like.  Right.  Oh, that's not cool.  You know what I mean?  So before anything, oh, you guys are cool.  This isn't cool.  Don't like this.  Now, of course, everybody loves Ozzy. 
[01:24:00]  Ozzy's great.  You know, back then it was like people would snicker.  It's like, why?  He's great.  Because we grew up in Chicago.  You know, rock radio was like, you love the cars and you like Black Sabbath.  You love Queen.  You know, you love Zeppelin.  It wasn't a big deal.  Right.  Then you get out in the New York-y world and it's like, you're supposed to like this band.  You're not supposed to like this band.  And don't wear this t-shirt.  It's just got so old.  Ugh, being too cool.  What bands did they expect you to say you liked at the time?  Well, it's like, there's, well, Sonic Youth would have been number one. 
[01:24:30]  Sure.  If you said you liked Sonic Youth, then that meant, you know, you...  Oh, these guys are cool.  Yeah.  And we love Sonic Youth.  Like I said, we love Sonic Youth, but in their mind, it was incompatible with like Sonic Youth and Led Zeppelin.  Right.  Can't like golf.  But of course, you get behind the scenes and you talk to Thirstmore from Sonic Youth.  What do you grow up listening to as a kid?  Led Zeppelin.  I mean, just like everybody else.  Van Halen.  Like Kurt Cobain.  Van Halen, Cheap Trick.  Absolutely.  Boston, I believe.  Trying to remember some of the other bands.  I mean, Teen Spirit is basically more than a feeling.  That's what a lot of people say.  In fact, I saw Nirvana.  I saw Nirvana at their absolute peak, never mind, playing in Japan. 
[01:25:00]  And Kurt started playing more than a feeling.  Oh, man.  And even saying, more than a feeling.  And kind of laughed.  And then they went into Teen Spirit.  Wow.  Shit, yeah.  I mean, he knew.  It's not like he, you know.  Right.  He loved classic rock.  Yeah.  I mean, he does.  That was his big influences.  Did you guys get treated well by the critics or the douche?  No.  No, I'm laughing.  I'm laughing because we got sort of a so-so review in Rolling Stone.  The two biggest albums I ever had, Siamese Dream and Melancholy, bad reviews in Rolling Stone.  So this is like good luck now because I got another bad review in Rolling Stone. 
[01:25:30]  Meanwhile, across the board, everywhere else, great album, best album in 15 years.  No, people are talking about this album.  Yeah.  And the two you just mentioned were amazing albums.  I'll say it for you.  Thank you.  Unbelievable albums.  Even the deep tracks.  Got bad reviews then.  Those are Rolling Stone.  They really are snobby and they try to be too hip.  And I just think they stink.  I think it's the most overrated magazine ever, is Rolling Stone.  I think they try to hate things.  Try to find something wrong with things instead of just letting it be sometimes. 
[01:26:00]  If it was the critics only, I wouldn't be here.  Fans have been amazing.  They're difficult in their own way, but I appreciate the relationship that they want you to bring the best you got.  Right.  At least with the fan, if you bring the best you got, they'll show up.  Right.  The critics will think of some freaking weird reason why somebody shouldn't listen to you.  But you seem like a guy that wouldn't pay attention to the critics.  Is that true?  I really don't, but at the same time, it's like, you know, it's a little weird to put out an album that you know is really good, 
[01:26:30]  you'd see, you get poor reviews from particular magazines who have a bone to pick, God knows why.  And then 15 years later, they're trying to get you to interview about the album that they panned back in the day,  because it's become a classic.  You know what I mean?  See, it's like a weird Dostoevsky movie or something.  You know what I mean?  It's like, hey, talk about the thing we didn't like then, and now we're going to talk about the thing we don't like now.  Right.  And it gets sort of surreal.  Yeah.  I think I have a good sense of what it is, but I don't know. 
[01:27:00]  I wouldn't be here if I didn't have some ability.  And the critical part of whether or not you match up at any given time with what they think is,  I don't think that has anything to do with what people think.  Right, right.  Did you get screwed over on your first album, like every band talks about, how they had to give away everything?  No.  Well, we signed one of those kind of record deals, but that was everybody.  Yeah.  It was everybody.  So there was nothing novel about that.  But where we got lucky was they said they didn't think we could sell records on a major label, 
[01:27:30]  so they put us on, they had an indie imprint in New York called Caroline, which Hull was on and a few other, Rob Zombie, White Zombie was on.  So it was a cool label, and they probably thought we were going to sell about 30,000 records.  We sold 400,000.  Oh, shit.  So by the time they bumped us up to the major label, they kind of couldn't mess with me, you know?  Oh, man.  You know what I mean?  I had the leverage of the moment, and then every time they would try to mess with me, we would sell more records.  So we kind of outran that Reaper, you know? 
[01:28:00]  Oh, that's pretty good.  Yeah, you actually had a track record to go in there with instead of...  Yeah, because there was an instance where they called me in for a meeting around 92.  Nevermind was huge, Pearl Jam was huge, and they said they wanted to reissue our first album  and kind of try to re-pump it up through the major system, bring it up to the major label, and I said no.  And you should just, I mean, jaws dropped, like, who's this kid to say no?  Right.  And I said, it's not the right record.  We made this kind of cool indie record.  It wasn't going to fit in right.  What was the name of that?  It was Gish, yeah.  Oh, right, right, of course.  Now, were you playing the type of music that you were writing, especially in the 90s, were 
[01:28:30]  you playing that in the 80s somewhere?  Were you, like...  No, we kind of, our song kind of evolved, you know, because we were taking kind of UK influences  and then what was happening out of Seattle.  There were bands out of Minneapolis that were playing kind of heavy.  You just kind of pick up things.  That's what I'm saying.  When I heard grunge out of Seattle, I thought, oh, this is classic rock.  Oh, okay.  You know, these guys had listened to the same stuff that I was listening to, you know.  I'm just wondering if you had to sit there and literally wait for the music scene to change 
[01:29:00]  from that 80s hairband thing to what it became in the 90s, and you kind of had to wait that  out?  Nobody, but nobody thought bands like Nirvana were going to sell what they were going to sell.  I mean, nobody.  You've got to remember.  You're right.  So you weren't trying to maybe go with what was popular and successful at the time.  Our thing was, like, can you sell out a place like the Roseland here in New York or the Aragon  in Chicago?  That's what the biggest alternative...  That's 4,000 people.  Right.  If you could sell those places out, you're like, wow. 
[01:29:30]  Huge.  We're huge, you know what I mean?  It wasn't like, oh, we're going to sell out the Enormodome.  You thought that was never going to happen.  MTV was playing alternative videos on Sunday night, 120 minutes.  If you're lucky, we got one video spin on our first album.  One.  And the funny thing about that was Anthony Kiedis from the Chili Peppers saw that one airing,  and that's how we ended up opening for the Chili Peppers on their tour.  Saw that at Roseland.  Yeah.  But, I mean, we're talking, like, small windows of opportunity.  Yeah, Ant talks about seeing you guys, Red Hot Chili Peppers. 
[01:30:00]  Pearl Jam, yeah.  And Pearl Jam at Roseland.  Yeah, it was like...  Way before any of the...  Well, Red Hot Chili Peppers definitely had their fan base by then.  Yeah.  You guys came out.  No one really even knew who you were at the time.  Yeah.  And, yeah, everybody was obviously waiting for the Chili Peppers.  It was you guys who just hit the scene.  And I remember me knowing everything about music.  I'm like, who are these guys?  And then, of course, you blow up.  You know what I remember about that show?  Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson were at that show. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, shit, really?  That's what I remember about that.  You know, it was like those sort of first celebrity encounters.  Like, oh, my God, it's Tommy Lee.  Were they having sex in front of you?  No, no.  I mean, this is...  They were perfectly behaved.  Yeah.  So, you're touring?  Fall, probably, yeah.  We figured it would take a while for people to kind of...  The album's ahead of what our expectations were, which is great.  So, you know.  So, but if you're going to put out an album, you're going to say, listen to the album. 
[01:31:00]  I'm going to go play the album in total, live.  You know, it's going to take a while for people to get into it.  Yeah.  How fast do you block people on Twitter?  Or are you a guy who, like, will never block anybody?  You got one chance.  Oh, no.  That's it.  Yeah.  If you want to say dumb stuff, it is to block you.  I just don't want that negativity.  Right.  I just don't get that.  You know what I mean?  I don't get that.  I don't feel like I have a responsibility to put up with the negativity.  Now, people who will ask...  They feel like you do.  That's their problem.  I mean, I agree with you. 
[01:31:30]  But the funny thing is, fans will ask really interesting questions, and I'll respond.  Right.  But, I mean, to me, this is my rules for the internet.  If you walk up and say something to me that you can't walk up and say to me on the street...  Oh, man.  If you walk up and say that to me on the street, I'm going to knock you out.  That's it.  So, as far as I'm concerned, same rules.  How the internet somehow changes that dynamic where you want to be rude.  Because it's just rude.  So, if you want to be rude, that's fine.  Go be rude with somebody who doesn't care.  And then they get pissed off, and maybe one of their friends will retweet them to you 
[01:32:00]  and say, could you unblock him?  And you know what?  Then that motherfucker gets blocked.  I'm not going to sit there while he's being the guy's lawyer.  It's better to just take out the whole village.  If you're living on the oxygen of whether or not somebody's blocked you, you ain't got a lot going on anyway.  Might want to look at your own life.  I mean, at least I turn around in my beautiful house, and my dogs, and my cats, and my friends, and my guitars.  You know, I turn around as something substantive. 
[01:32:30]  You turn around, and you're looking at, like, you know, nothing.  Well, okay, then it means a lot, I guess.  Probably the unfinished basement.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Mom's upstairs screaming, you know?  Yeah.  But they never say stuff like that in person.  Like, even, like, there's just this cunty undertone sometimes.  And then the fake names, it drives me fucking crazy.  It's like they attack a performer.  Very anonymous.  They don't just go on as who they are and say something that they would say when they met you.  That's the frustrating thing.  I'm 6'4", you know, 220, something like that.  I mean, it's amazing how much doesn't get said to me in person. 
[01:33:00]  You know what I mean?  Well, do people don't have that celebrity boundary?  Because sometimes people forget that celebrities are still people and will still react like men.  Hey, I grew up lower middle class, working class, my whole family, immigrants, you know, and everybody, probably 90% of the people listening to you understand what I mean.  You grew up in that, it's the rules of the neighborhood.  That's it.  I don't care.  You can call it whatever you want, social media, whatever.  It's the rules of the neighborhood.  You want a mess?  Okay, let's go.  But I learned pretty early on you don't go toe-to-toe because that's the worst thing. 
[01:33:30]  Right.  You know what I mean?  I mean, that's just, that's like coming off Olympus to fight a flea, you know?  Yeah.  Because they ain't got no power and then, you know, you start getting, haters gonna hate, you know?  It's like, thanks, guys.  Thanks for the deep philosophy.  Thanks for the deep philosophy.  Haters gonna hate.  No, but he taught me the best thing to do, send them, because they're following you, so you send them a private message that's horrible and then block them.  But I mean, it's got to be completely horrible. 
[01:34:00]  I brutalize the person and then block them so they can't even answer me.  I have to tell you, though, probably about five, six times, somebody said something where,  it wasn't just say overtly mean, but they were being rude.  And I would send them a private message and I would say, you know, what you're saying is not really nice or not cool.  And every time the person would apologize.  Every time.  Yeah.  Because it's the attention they want.  They're just saying the thing to get attention.  It's like if I sit here and just poke you, you know what I mean, until you get provoked. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  That's what they want.  They just want attention.  I get it.  But I just can't deal with the negativity.  To me, that part of the internet's just like, that's...  You think that'll change eventually?  You know what I think will happen?  They'll either get such sophisticated systems where you can, you know, decide what you want to filter.  Like, they'll have a system where it'll just, it'll just, it'll figure it out for you.  Right.  And it'll just block people.  And then it'll change because you know you're not going to get through.  Or you're going to have to be so weird like, you know, hey, Corgan, you know, Tupperware isn't good enough for you. 
[01:35:00]  You know what I mean?  It'll be so lame.  You'll be like, what?  You know, they'll have to try to figure something out to bust the system.  Because ultimately those people, you know, the Facebook, they want you there.  They want you looking at their ads or whatever.  They're going to commoditize their stuff.  They don't want you getting off that site because some jerk in, you know, Cleveland's got to say something.  Right.  They want you there.  Once they figure out the filtering and all that stuff, forget about it.  Well, the positive side, it makes it easier for you guys to promote yourselves. 
[01:35:30]  I don't know.  No?  We were one of the first bands to really jump on the Internet and see the potential in creating new fan relationships.  And I think it's been a mixed blessing for us.  And we had 30,000 people in our chat room probably in around like late 90s.  It's a pretty big number.  I mean, that's a big number now.  That's huge.  But we found ratio-wise about 100 to 1.  Really?  100 Facebook fans or back in the day, MySpace fans, one sale.  Wow.  100 to 1. 
[01:36:00]  So I don't know why I got to spend my time talking to the 99 that ain't going to buy shit, do shit, do nothing but complain to deal with the one person who probably doesn't like the negativity is going to buy anyway.  Right.  And probably wants you to be more dignified.  So why were those guys involved, the 99, you think?  I don't know.  It is an attention thing.  I think people like, like, you're in the public eye.  I think people like that they're involved with you in some way, shape, or form.  So we take more of a kind of a dignified approach, you know, like we don't have slavishly begging and stuff like that. 
[01:36:30]  And we've seen our sort of core fan base grow because it's sort of more of a community to be a part of as opposed to a constant shill.  Right.  You know, there's a lot of stuff I don't promote.  You know, I probably should just out of, you know, Fidel.  I didn't promote today like I probably should have.  But then if, like, if it goes well, I might say, oh, thanks, you know, to you guys.  It was cool.  Thanks for having me on.  But I don't feel like I got to, like, be, you know, Bieber land, you know, like push my perfume and, you know, hey, it was amazing to be on Opie Anthony. 
[01:37:00]  You know what I mean?  Let's call that.  To me, that's not why people like you guys and that's not why they like people like me.  They don't want to feel that.  It's funny you bring him up.  What do you think of someone like Justin Bieber?  I mean, he's not that talented for the following he has.  I think he's fairly talented for his age.  But look, there's always going to be a Justin Bieber, a Donny Osmond.  It's not those. 
[01:37:30]  So you don't think he's going to have longevity, right?  That's hard to say.  Really?  Well, look, I don't know what they used to call it, Q rating, you know, like who the public knows, right?  But a kid like Bieber, I mean, he might be worth 10 times more on the reality show, you know, 10 years from now.  Or, you know, he starts a men's hair care line.  You know, that's the world we live in now.  Music is just the thing they kind of do to make money all these other ways.  I mean, I went one time with my nieces, who, of course, are Bieber crazy, and there's like seven different Bieber dolls. 
[01:38:00]  Seven!  Oh, shit.  You know, Justin in the green jacket, Justin in the blue jacket.  But your talent blows his away.  So how does that make you feel?  It doesn't bother me.  At all.  To me, it's like different businesses.  You know what I mean?  I mean, you guys know the guys out there who just do like whatever to whatever, you know?  Well, his voice is weak, and he's just, you know, he's writing pop songs that almost anyone could be singing and writing.  I wouldn't disagree, but I think it's, to me, it's not, that's the part of the business that's like a no-brainer.  Just like making, like, the bad teen movie or something. 
[01:38:30]  It's like, it's going to be there, right?  Right, right.  It's all the other stuff that pretends to be something, and the record business rolls it out and tries to get you to buy inauthentic things pretending to be authentic.  Why do they pretend for it to be authentic?  Because the money's in the authenticity.  So then they treat people like me, who are real, bad, because they can't control me, and they can't get me to crank out a hit every time they stick a needle in my back.  You know what I mean?  That's the part that they're never going to understand.  The Jimi Hendrixes of the world and the John Lennons, those are the people that sell a tremendous amount of records. 
[01:39:00]  And the public loves, on some intrinsic level, even if they don't always agree with them, like John Lennon was incredibly political, and Bob Marley had his politics, but the public loves them because they're just themselves.  Right.  And they're never going to figure that out.  Because you can't control a Jimi Hendrix of Bob Marley.  You know what I mean?  Right, right.  Jimi Hendrix was doing stuff that we still can't figure out.  Still.  And for that time, wow.  When they push out these teen idols, is it more like, because guys like Hendrix or Lennon won't sell to that, like your niece, like that demo, there's a lot of money, but those great artists aren't going to sell to that demo, so they've got to find something to cover it. 
[01:39:30]  They're easily influenced, it seems like.  I would say, look, I loved the Beatles when I was a little boy, like starting at five years old.  Yeah.  Beatles blew my mind.  I'm sorry, but, and especially, I mean, you know, I meet all these executives, they all got kids.  I don't understand why they wouldn't want to make music that would, I mean, yes, be exciting.  But music that doesn't feel weird, right?  To me, and I don't mean to criticize them this way, but I'm criticizing the whole genre. 
[01:40:00]  When you've got, like, teens singing about things that teens probably shouldn't be singing about, that does affect people, families, kids' perceptions.  I know moms who got teenage daughters that are, you know, Bieber fever, and they got to kind of wrestle with the themes, because the kids are attracted, but the, you know what I mean?  And I'm not saying an artist like Bieber should be controlled, but at some point, somebody's got to make a decision there to put that stuff out.  Right.  And they got no problem looking the other way when he's singing lyrics that are, you know, probably age inappropriate, right? 
[01:40:30]  And that does affect American families the way families have to deal with their information.  And that is the difference between Donnie and Marie or Sean Cassidy and this generation.  Right.  This generation has no problem being overtly sexual in their music to kids that probably shouldn't be listening to that at that point.  They still don't know what their penises do.  Well, yeah, hopefully.  Exactly.  That's where it gets a little queasy. 
[01:41:00]  And especially the young girls who are, you know, 14, 15, they're rolling them out with, like, low-cut tops.  I mean, that sends kids are influenced by that.  And the record business does have a responsibility to not sort of exploit that.  I mean, look, you want to exploit me as a male, you know, and roll some chick out in her 20s or 40s, fine.  But the kids, I find that really queasy.  The way they sexualize the kids to sell records, I think that's messed up.  When there's so much money for the taking, though, I mean, you can't—I don't think ethics has ever won out over cash. 
[01:41:30]  But, hey, if somebody came in here today and said, hey, if you guys light yourself on fire, your ratings are going to go up or, you know, we'll give you a million dollars.  Flame on!  Yeah, you'd be surprised.  As long as you wear the Facebook t-shirt, you know, we'll give you a million.  I'm not going to lie to you.  We've been guilty of that over the years.  Okay.  You know, we've matured as a radio show, but we did the edgy, outrageous shit knowing that it was the easiest way to get more people listening.  Hey, I've done dumb stuff, too.  But the point is, at some point, if you have a place of responsibility, you have to wrestle with those moral obligations. 
[01:42:00]  To me, there are people knowingly marching things out past that line because there's a business advantage.  I have a problem with that.  I don't think it's a provocative thing I'm saying.  I mean, I think it's an age-old argument.  No, I get it.  Our philosophy back in the day, especially, we would do these really over-the-top edgy shit to bring you to the show.  And then hopefully the day-by-day show would keep you there.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Because it was hard to get people to listen to you.  So how do you do that? 
[01:42:30]  You do something maybe a little shocking.  They're like, oh, you hear what Opie and Anthony did today?  And then you listen to the show and realize, oh, they're not just doing shocking stuff.  They're actually talking about real stuff.  And they're also hopefully funny.  I think the business is changing for all of us where we can be qualitative.  That's what I'm saying.  I think I would say to a record executive, if you make—I don't want to say wholesome because I'm a rock and roll guy.  But I think you can make music that's, let's say, got a little bit more depth, that's going to last, that you're not embarrassed to pay—you know, you're not in the car kind of wincing. 
[01:43:00]  Right.  You know, listening to a 15-year-old sing about being in the club.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Yes.  You think it's all relative, though?  Because when you look at, like, Elvis or the Beatles, who are iconic now, but they were considered, especially Elvis, like, obscene at one time.  Like, when Elvis came out, you know, obviously they would film him from the waist up.  And the Beatles, by a lot of older generation people at that time, were not considered—they were considered, like, terrible for people under a certain age. 
[01:43:30]  So I wonder if it's all relative, but it just kind of—it all advances.  Well, the Beatles were singing about holding—I want to hold your hand.  There's a long tradition of rock and roll, like, Jerry Lee Lewis, great balls of fire, hello.  The point is, is it sort of in your face?  And I think now we're in a in-your-face culture.  Yeah.  It's just in your—I mean, it's inescapable.  Right.  And so if—I'm not saying you're saying this, but if the argument is, like, well, it's just the way that it is, I think that's when cultures, like, collapse, you know what I mean?  Because then it's anything goes. 
[01:44:00]  Like I've been saying for a couple years, you will see a porn—a porn mainstream pop girl who does porn.  That will be the next marketing gag.  I guarantee it.  You will see that.  Wow.  You will see a mainstream 20-something girl, maybe even late teens because it's legal.  People who does porn and does pop music.  You will see that because the marketing opportunity is just too rich.  Wow.  Well, like, like, Paris Hilton got famous from a porn.  I didn't—Kardashian get famous from doing a porn. 
[01:44:30]  That's the only reason she's famous.  So, yeah, that certainly can happen.  Yeah.  But in those cases, there was quality there.  Oh, the porn you mean?  Yeah.  There was some quality there.  I think Paris was great.  I've got to be honest.  I'm not going to complain about the films.  They were terrific.  Yeah, I really did enjoy Paris's—  But then to make them, like, incredibly famous just because of that, I just never understand that.  Can you imagine going back into Time Machine?  Okay, you know, we're not in our 20s, right?  Can you imagine going back into Time Machine 30 years ago and saying, hey, someday people  will make porn, and they will become mainstream celebrities in America? 
[01:45:00]  Because they made porn.  You would never believe it.  It's unbelievable.  I mean, you would never—that's what I'm saying.  It's unbelievable.  Once it goes to anything goes, then where do we—there is no line, right?  Right.  And it can't be a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Well, there's no line, so that's the way it is.  That's what I mean.  Like, we're talking about internet discourse.  Well, that's—you know how many times I've had some guy I've hired to run my internet  site tell me, well, that's just the way that it is.  It's like—  No.  And I'm paying for it.  I'm paying for these people to tell me I don't have quality.  It's like, let somebody else do it for free, you know? 
[01:45:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  That makes perfect sense.  Yeah.  I think if I went back in time, what would be most amazing to me is the amount of energy  and time I spend on my phone.  Like, I literally—if I leave my house and I don't have my phone, I panic.  I feel like I'm not connected.  And I think that's the attraction to, like, people in our age group, at least, is you can't  believe all the information you can get immediately.  Like, when you—when I was fucking 18, 19 years old, you just—you went out, and that 
[01:46:00]  was it.  Yeah, we talked to people.  That's the amazing part to me, isn't it?  We got to talk to people.  I actually will go for a walk, and I will turn my phone off so that I will actually  look and go, oh, there's a tree.  Just shit you took for granted growing up.  I mean, seriously, I have to—and, of course, five minutes, and I have that impulse, like,  and, like, oh, no, the phone's—I mean, that's ridiculous.  And the sad part is it's all just nonsense.  And then you do turn your phone on, and you're like, there's nothing here, really.  Yeah, what am I looking for?  Yeah, Twitter, Facebook, this, that.  You go to, like, five or six points, and it's the same shit. 
[01:46:30]  Over and over again.  People are refreshing right now as they speak to us.  Wasn't it—it was rude for a while to use your cell phone during dinner and stuff.  Now it just seems like that's gone, too.  I see the new thing, which is you kind of don't check your phone for 20, and then when  the other person checks the phone, then you get to check your phone.  It's sort of like, okay, we have our little phone minute, and then you put your phone back down.  Put the phone back down, or if somebody gets up to go to the bathroom, obviously, grab your phone.  That's a no-brain.  What are we looking for? 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  Can you answer that question?  What are we looking for?  Because you decide you want to be with this person, you go to dinner, so it's like, that could be a nice moment,  and you could, you know, talk about whatever you want, but then you feel like you have to see  if there's something better on your phone.  I think we're missing something.  Yeah, there's never any giant revelation on there that's like, oh, I'm so glad I looked.  Right.  It's just always the same nonsense.  Fucking potato chips is what it is.  But it's new, though.  That's what it is.  Like, again, someone who's 19 might, because he grew up with that, but I'm 43, so it's fucking 
[01:47:30]  like, I can't believe that it's there.  I can't believe I can just open my phone and look at text messages, and like, it's still  very new to me.  I was 23 or 24 before I ever sent a text message.  Right.  Imagine where it's going to be in 10 years.  It'll just be silent.  We'll just do it without actually holding your phone.  It'll be like Obi-Wan, you know, the Princess Leia will come up, and you'll be able to  talk to your girlfriend 3D.  That's what's scary.  It just keeps advancing.  Have you heard about the new thing where they're putting bands on with holograms?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They did it with Tupac.  But that's just the beginning. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, it's going to be all, every band.  Every band ever is going to now go on tour in hologram form.  Right.  And whoever owns the rights to that band is going to make now a fortune on touring.  And then you're going to get like Tupac with Janis Joplin.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Tupac, you're like, what?  That would never happen.  Yeah.  And imagine a band that's been gone or dead for years being like the number one grossing  band on tour that year.  That would just be the oddest thing.  Look at it.  The opportunity for any band to become as big as, say, like the Beatles or the Rolling 
[01:48:30]  Stones.  Once those bands are gone, gone, gone, and can never come back in any form, right?  Well, I'm sorry.  If you put the Beatles on in hologram form, they're probably going to be one of the top grossing  bands out there.  Like, and you don't have, there's no temperaments in the back over the deli tray, temper tantrums.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, nobody to deal with.  It's just like, you know, press the switch and the holograms will come in, you know.  I would go in a second.  I would go in a second.  I would see the Beatles like that in quality hologram form. 
[01:49:00]  I hate to say it.  I never got to see Nirvana, one of my favorite bands, of the last 20, so many years.  I was actually, somebody asked me the other day if we'd played with Nirvana.  We played with Nirvana one time in Boston, and it was, and not sold out.  Really?  Yeah.  What year was that?  Maybe 91.  Although everyone in Boston that probably says they were there, the place would be overflowing.  One of those.  Yeah, I saw them.  Yeah.  How big was the venue?  About a thousand.  Oh.  Were you close to Kurt?  Uh, you know, it was weird because I'd gone out with Courtney before. 
[01:49:30]  So, you know, we kind of reached a point where there was no weirdness.  You know what I mean?  It was like, we're cool.  Yeah.  Right.  You know, like, you know, he needed me to help him.  Because sometimes she'd open for us, so he'd be with her.  And so, you know, we'd make sure he was taken care of.  And we'd have to put extra security because obviously everybody wanted to get to him.  And so, I know he appreciated that there was a respect level there.  It wasn't weird by the end.  Did you ever have to talk about it?  Or did it just kind of something that worked itself out? 
[01:50:00]  Uh, you know, it's one of those weird things like, hey, you know.  Hey, I used to be with your wife.  You know, I don't know.  It's the same for any guy.  Right.  That's cool.  You get to hear any of those cassettes he left behind?  No, no.  Where are they?  Because he was always, like, just fiddling and recording stuff on cassettes.  He was so brilliant.  I mean, you know, he doesn't need me to sing his praises, you know.  Yeah.  But I think he was the real deal, you know what I mean? 
[01:50:30]  Absolutely.  And we all knew it.  I mean, you know, I mean, if I could explain at the time, it was a bit like the high school  quarterback, you know what I mean?  You look and you go, like, this guy looks great, sings great, amazing songwriter.  It's like, this is kind of unfair, you know.  Right.  And of course, everybody gravitated to him.  And, you know, the time you're jealous and, oh, it's not this and I want to be that and all  that, and then when the guy's gone, you're like, wow, I wish that guy was still around.  Right.  Because that guy got stuff done, you know.  And now that I look back, you know, we weren't as powerful as a generation without him. 
[01:51:00]  And then all the crap that came and the posers that came afterwards, I mean, that's why you  need guys like that to kind of beat that back down.  I can't imagine what he would say to this world today as far as what's happened with music.  Right.  You know, I'm kind of, I'm more negotiable in that way.  I'm willing to kind of work with things.  I kind of like pop music.  It's all fine and dumb to me.  But a guy like that would have taken it on.  Sure.  I don't know.  Like, you know, do you hear Lennon, they released an audio of a Rolling, um, it might  have been a Rolling Stone interview he did when he was 40.  And he goes, you know, I'm 40 now. 
[01:51:30]  I've changed a lot of the way I feel.  And it's like, it really always wasn't the establishment.  Sometimes it was me.  And like, he was really weird.  I'm like how you're putting the inflection on without the accent.  Yeah, because I try to give the message without, you know, because I would have just, instead  of focusing on the horrible accent.  Can't you do the liver poodle-ian now?  I really can't.  The liver poodle-ian.  But people can't see, but my hand motion, some would say, would be exactly like Lennon's  in a discussion of this sort.  I've grown up.  But he's, yeah, he said it was, yeah, I should have just done like a really bad Irish accent.  But he was kind of changing and becoming like a regular 40-year-old. 
[01:52:00]  Even guys like that, I was amazed to hear that interview kind of come around and go, eh.  Changing his ways a little bit.  I mean, it's hard to say, but look, even in his 40s, which unfortunately is when John  Lennon died, he was still a great musician.  And even then, even if the message changes through the mouth, the music affects things,  you know.  And Generation X, we, you know, we don't have as much strength as we should have had.  Some people died.  Some people got high and never came back, you know. 
[01:52:30]  So it's been a shame because there were a lot of great voices, you know.  I didn't necessarily like everybody, but I respected that there were a lot of great voices.  Do you have a different look on things?  Like, will you listen to some of the music you wrote early on and go like, ugh?  Or do you look at everything like, hey, that was pretty good?  No, no.  There's definitely some cringe, cringe moments.  Yeah.  But you kind of think, well, you know, you knew what you were thinking and you see where  it kind of like, could you get caught up in dumb stuff?  You know, like we used to think like we had to be heavier and part of that was we were  playing in front of these big crowds and you want everybody to jump up and down. 
[01:53:00]  So the amount of energy we spent making certain songs, which aren't great songs, you know,  they're good energy.  But now I look back and think I could have done something better if I wasn't so obsessed  with trying to get the crowd to jump up and down.  Is it embarrassing to do a music video?  Whenever I see a music video, I'm always amazed.  Like you see a performer singing and it's like they have to go, cut, do it again.  And everybody's watching.  Is that hard to do?  Because I would be horrified to do that.  I always felt a bit weird about it, which I think is why in a lot of videos, and we  started with the record label, why a lot of videos don't have that sort of just, you 
[01:53:30]  know, here's the band performing in the parking lot stuff.  We tried to figure out ways to not do so much singing because I always felt that if it wasn't  the right thing, it came across as inauthentic.  And I thought that that was sort of not who we were.  And let me tell you, it's a little weird.  You know, they roll the tape and you're standing there like singing and then it's like beep.  And then everyone runs around.  The guy's doing this and you're standing there.  It's like waiting to rock again.  Yeah, to rock again.  Oh, man. 
[01:54:00]  The trick is you got to sing like you were singing the song.  You know what I mean?  Like you just can't go with your mouth open.  You got to really sing.  You sing it, so at least you're singing it.  You got to see the veins in your neck or it's not happening.  There's got to be some kind of emotion coming from you because I think that's sort of what  people feel or want to see coming through.  If you're just mouthing, then you're really just acting.  Yeah, we got to get Billy out of here in a couple minutes.  You're going to L.A., right?  Yep.  And we haven't even talked about the new record.  That's okay. 
[01:54:30]  You sure?  You got to promote a little bit.  Just tell us a little bit about the new record.  I think we were releasing one song at a time, and it was going okay, and I'd said I don't  want to do albums anymore.  Typical.  And then I thought, you know what?  We just need to make a really great record and get everybody back on point, including  us.  And so the funny thing has been how people are shocked that I made a great record.  Why is that?  I don't get that.  Because the mainstream, whatever, that consciousness assumes that everything an artist does, you 
[01:55:00]  want to be that level.  And when you've made a lot of money and you've had a lot of success, I mean, you saw it with  Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, some of the guys I really respect.  There comes a point where it's like, not every album has to be the orgasmic, here it is in  the starship.  You know what I mean?  Sometimes you just want to make music that you feel strongly about.  And so when I say that, well, you didn't feel strongly about your own work?  He's like, no, we were trying to reach people. 
[01:55:30]  And so we found something that we felt strongly about to reach people.  But some music just needs to be introspective.  Some music just needs to be weird, just to kind of figure some other stuff out.  So this is the first album I made a long time where I was like, okay, I'm going to focus  on that level.  And it's like people are like, oh, I climbed out of some grave or something.  Meanwhile, I've been here the whole time.  I've been putting out albums every couple of years.  It feels good.  I'm happy.  It's nice to see people happy around us for a change.  And it's been a while.  And we're just kind of going with that for the moment.  Yeah.  You're looking forward to touring? 
[01:56:00]  It'll be interesting because we're going to play the whole album in sequence.  And we hired Sean Evans, who's been working with Roger Waters on the wall, live staging.  I just saw the wall in Chicago at Wrigley Field, 420-foot wall on the outfield.  It was insane.  I mean, 42 projectors.  It was like only Roger Waters could pull out, you know, the Flying Pig and the whole thing.  Yeah.  So, I mean, we wish we were that lucky.  But we're going to do something where, you know, at least you can experience the album  played live.  And then there'll be sort of a set of visuals to go with it. 
[01:56:30]  So it'll be more of an experiential thing.  Kind of like back in the day.  I mean, back in the 70s day.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  What's your favorite Sabbath record?  Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath.  Oh, cool.  I think is their, that's where, that's the difference between just Sabbath being a great  rock and roll band and Sabbath being an incredible artistic, creative band.  That record's just so dark and crazy and weird and, you know what I mean?  I always, actually, I always loved Volume 4.  I don't know if you know that album.  It's kind of got a really weird sound.  And I remember talking to Tony, I only once in the studio, and I said, what was going 
[01:57:00]  on with Volume 4?  What a weird sound.  He was like, yeah.  See, now there's the accent.  Yeah.  It goes up at the end.  Yeah.  And he said, he said like something along the lines, like, like, because it was out,  they were working in LA in some house.  And because it was LA, the drug dealer would just stop by every day.  He probably knew it was like, it's a good place to, yeah.  He's like, you know, it's the drug dealer.  And he's like, yeah, it's really crazy.  You know, it's like, but it's like, you know, as a fan, you're like, oh, this record's 
[01:57:30]  so dark and weird.  I wonder what they're, you know, in case a kid, like, upside down crosses a seat.  Yeah.  And he's like, oh, yeah, the drug dealer was coming by every day.  And that's the only reason.  Every Sabbath record, every song on the record couldn't go on to any other album.  I think that was, like, there's nothing on Master Reality that belongs on Sabbath,  Bloody Sabbath, or from Sabotage to, there's just nothing that should go on another record.  Yeah.  And actually, I just got some sort of weird from Japan, like, perfect, you know, I think  you call it SACD.  It's like super high mastered of mob rules. 
[01:58:00]  Because I love Sabotage with Dio, too.  I mean, it sounded unbelievable.  I mean, and I got to meet Dio once and talk to him for 45 minutes.  That was incredible.  Yeah, he came on the show once.  He's just a fucking great guy.  He was fantastic.  Really was.  And that voice of his was just amazing.  And then you go, wait, he's 70.  Yeah.  That last tour, he was.  No.  He was 70.  Yeah.  He was born, like, in the early 40s.  Jesus Christ.  So when he was on that last set of tour where he was doing Sabbath, he was in his 70s. 
[01:58:30]  Holy shit.  Man.  And you're like, wow.  I came around my head around that.  Yeah.  And still hitting every note.  Yeah, he had one of those friggin' rock and roll voices.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Billy, what a great comment.  I like this a lot.  Oh, thank you.  I think we got to get you out of here because you got to go to L.A.  Doesn't that sound wrong?  What?  We got to get you out of here so you can go to L.A.  That just sounds so wrong.  I'm sorry.  It's like you guys are condemning me.  We got a guitar in the corner and everything.  Go to L.A.  We wanted you to play, but I know you're a busy man, and we appreciate you coming in. 
[01:59:00]  Thank you.  Thanks for having me.  And good luck with the, you're not going to need the luck, but Oceania?  We do need the luck, honestly.  You think?  It's a really weird atmosphere, you know?  Right.  I mean, look, if you're competing against people you respect grudgingly, it's one thing,  but when you're competing against a bunch of robots, I mean, it's robot land out there.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's shocking to me.  Because alternative culture was always like, well, there's all that, and then there's us.  Right.  And then when the Stepford Wives took over alternative music, it got, you know, it's weird. 
[01:59:30]  It's like, you're looking around, like, what happened to that kind of vibe?  Right.  You know, we just don't fit in our, you know, we'll play all your old music, but you just  don't fit in our demographic now.  You're not heavy enough.  You're not this enough, you know?  And then you listen to these bands, and it's like, who are these people?  Right.  You don't even know what they think.  You don't know what they feel.  You don't know what they look like.  I mean, it's just sort of like this blur of people.  Right.  And they just keep running them out there with, like, you know, heavy names, like, you  know, Thor Hammer.  You know what I mean?  It's like, okay, just keep running them out here, you know? 
[02:00:00]  I mean, Rob's like, okay, I'm still here.  You've been around long enough to see the whole thing change.  Yeah.  A few times.  It's bastardized.  I get the feeling, though, like Rush just put out a new album, right?  People are praising that album.  Okay.  Biggest first week in Canada they've ever had.  Really?  Okay?  So that tells you something.  People are kind of figuring it out.  You know what?  Like, I'd rather have Rush around, you know what I mean?  Now, they made a great album.  Than Thor Hammer.  But, hey, I'd rather have Rush around than all these other people. 
[02:00:30]  I think people are starting to figure that out.  Right.  You know, because don't forget, you know, Hope I Die Before I Get Old.  There was a point where you weren't supposed to be old and rock.  Right.  But, hey, I'll go see The Who any day.  I'll take The Who at 80 over just about anybody.  Right.  Because they're going to give you something.  I mean, remember when they played at the 2001 9-11 memorial?  Mm-hmm.  And people were like, because that's what you need in those moments.  You need real music.  Right.  And that's the weird thing for me, because economy's bad. 
[02:01:00]  A lot of people are struggling.  They need real music right now.  Right.  And people like us aren't perfect.  It's not.  You know?  Like, I did an interview with Geddy Lee yesterday, and the guy said, oh, you know, it was kind  of like a co-interview.  And the guy said, you know, you both have unique voices, you know?  And Geddy Lee goes, nobody wants our voices.  Yeah.  Because we both have weird voices, right?  Right, right.  But that's part of, you know, Rush being weird and different, and Geddy's weird voice, and  my weird voice.  That's kind of what people like, because you're real.  Yeah, and you know it when you hear it. 
[02:01:30]  You know who it is.  I call it unique, not weird.  Okay, great.  But the point is, is that maybe we're starting to figure out that the unique quality is the  thing that really makes the difference.  Right.  Because you can't manufacture people like me, you know what I mean?  And maybe you don't want to.  But, I mean, okay, how many Eddie Vedder clones have they marched out?  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's been a few over the years.  And I'm not a big Vedder fan, but at least he's Eddie Vedder.  You know what I mean?  You know who he is.  You know what he's about.  Okay, well, okay, great. 
[02:02:00]  These other people, I don't know what they think.  I don't even, they might be from Mars.  They don't know what they're thinking.  Exactly.  We're never going to hear an auto-tuned Billy Corgan?  No, actually, I refuse to use auto-tuned in the studio.  No shit.  Believe me, there's times where it's like, it would be so much easier, and I've got to  get home, and I just go back out and sing it again.  Right.  Because I just don't want to be that guy.  A little flat on that last line there.  Fuck, yeah.  Can't you just run it through a machine?  No.  You know, you brought up Rush so quickly.  Why aren't they in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? 
[02:02:30]  Why isn't Kiss in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  Right.  What is that all about, do you think?  It's got to be some kind of politics.  You just made Jimmy very happy.  Yeah, between Sabbath and Kiss.  I'm not driving me nuts.  The fucking bands.  I mean, I went to Sabbath's induction, and they finally got in after all those years.  But Kiss not getting in and Rush, it's just, it's sickening.  What does Rush have to do at this point?  It's stupid.  I think, I've been talking, because I've been doing the press rounds here in New York.  Yeah.  I think it's time where the, look, the music business is messed up, but it's time to start 
[02:03:00]  bringing in those bands that people love.  You know what I mean?  Mm-hmm.  It's not a critics thing anymore.  Like, we're talking about the critics.  Mm-hmm.  Right.  A lot of people love my band.  A lot of people don't like my band.  Don't like me.  But rock and roll, if you don't have that passion, I mean, what the fuck are we doing?  You know what I mean?  Right.  If you just turn it into just baking cookies and stuff like they try, okay, Kiss, still  getting it done.  Still.  But what?  Rolling Stone can't give them a cover? 
[02:03:30]  Why?  Because Gene might say something?  Might make fun of Rolling Stone?  That's the way it used to be, right?  Sure.  Like, bring it on.  I was rock and roll.  That's why I got a wrestling company.  It's like, bring it on.  What happened to the bring it on?  What happened to the bring it on part of rock and roll?  Yeah, yeah.  They're telling us you gotta go because you gotta fly.  They're whispering, you gotta play.  Do I?  Yeah.  My jet's waiting on the thing.  You have to go to L.A.  We'd have you sit in for the rest of the show.  I'm loving this conversation.  Thanks.  All right, well.  What track do you want us to play off the new CD?  Celestial seems to be the popular one. 
[02:04:00]  Okay.  We'll do that from Ocean Mania.  The Smashing Pump.  Thanks for having me, guys.  I appreciate it.  Billy, it's so cool to have you.  Thanks, man.  Absolutely.  Really cool.  Anytime, please.  I'm glad you guys reached out to me because I didn't know.  I was like, what the fuck is this about?  I was bummed out.  I saw that.  I was like, I got no problem with you guys.  Yeah, I know, I know.  That would have been hilarious if he blocked you.  Fuck this Obie's negativity.  Ad Billy has blocked you.  And it was almost negative.  I was like frustrated.  I'm like, come on.  We've been fans of you forever.  I thought you said fucking lame, bro. 
[02:04:30]  I did say fucking lame, bro.  You're fucking lame, bro.  I have to be mixed up.  I was like, what is that about?  You know, it goes back to something we did 10 years ago that had nothing to do with you  that we don't even know.  That's how weird this shit gets sometimes.  Some publicist thing.  Yeah, you don't have to get into it.  I'm just letting you know.  I march into radio stations, right?  Yeah.  Where they won't play whatever.  And I just try to go meet the guy or girl and say, what's the deal?  And they'll go, do you remember back in 94 when you blanky blank?  And I'm like, really?  That's what this problem is about? 
[02:05:00]  We played the competition's radio station when we were trying to do a promotion.  Oh, shut up.  Right.  And you're like, but I'm still here.  Right.  Like, that makes sense if I'm not here, but I'm still here.  Right.  I mean, you know, the politics in these businesses.  I'm just glad we worked it out.  Look at the political discourse.  I mean, who doesn't get to talk?  Who gets to talk?  Who knows who?  Who's somebody's boy?  I'm always amazed.  Like, if you watch CNN or something, and they're going at it.  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. 
[02:05:30]  And they get to the end of the segment.  They're like, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  And you know, they go back in the green room.  Oh, Bob.  Oh, yeah.  How's your golfing?  Yep.  It's just fake wrestling.  We've been on those shows.  Yes.  So we've seen it in person.  In the green room, you're absolutely right.  They're like, so many.  Everyone's all pals.  You working on that book?  Yeah, it's going well.  What publishing?  Oh, yeah.  I've worked with them.  Yeah, they're just the best of friends.  They're all drunks.  Oh, my God.  Everybody on any news day.  I've gone out with the Fox News people.  I've never met a bunch of drunks like the Fox News people.  Boy, can they drink. 
[02:06:00]  I believe in psychological terms.  That's called unconscious guilt.  Is it?  Well, I'm right there with them, though, at the bar.  So, Jesus.  All right.  Well, my private jet is with you.  Yes.  I just got to go to L.A.  It's at Billy on Twitter, which I think is the most amazing thing about you, that you were  able to get Billy on Twitter names.  Well, you got to get at, not Opie Radio.  Yeah.  I tried for Opie.  There's another guy out there that might have that one.  Whatever.  All right.  Iraq, you going to play from there? 
[02:06:30]  The Celestials?  The Celestials.  Yeah, I said that.  All right, Iraq.  Just play it.  Yeah, the new Smashing Pumpkins.  Billy Corrigan.  It was a pleasure.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks, man.  Thank you.  On the day that you were born, they built an empire off the screen.  I can't explain.  Endlessly, they'll set you free.  Give you reason to believe this empty place.

[02:08:30]  Never let the summer catch you down.  Never let your thoughts run free.  Even while the numbers draw you out.  Everything I want is free.  You're not me.  And never, ever will you ever be.  I'm gonna find you. 
[02:09:00]  I'm gonna find you.  And never run against.  I'm gonna find you.  Till the end.  Till the end.  Till the end.  Never let the summer catch you down.  Never let your thoughts run free.

[02:15:30]  I've never heard of that  That's not a Dudley  It's not a Dudley  It's a Dudley's manager  Yeah how many Dudley's are there  I know  I mean all told  Two  Okay in the history of ECW  How many Dudley's were there  There's only two I acknowledge  Oh my god  Because the Dudley guy  That did our show  And the other Dudley guy  That was black I think  Bubba Ray and D-Von Dudley  Were managed by Sign Guy Dudley  I don't know that guy  But I mean  They went crazy for a while  They had  Big Dick Dudley  Dances with Dudley  Dudley Dudley  Dudley Do-right  No  No not Dudley  Never had that one 
[02:16:00]  That's like  You know what  He's not a Dudley  But I mean  There's only one  Ted DiBiase  But who signs the belt also  Virgil  And that  And that doesn't mean  That he's Ted DiBiase  He's not the million dollar man  You might have to give him a pass though  Because he's a huge fan of the show  And he's the reason  Billy Corgan got on our show today  Who's that?  Oh  This Dudley dude  Only Virgil  Alright enough  Of your Tumblr account  Dude the amount of pictures  That have shown up  Of just fucking Virgil  Sitting at an empty table

It was Sign Guy Dudley  It was their manager  Their entire ECW  And he's a big fan of the show  Yes he is a big fan of the show  And he saw my tweet  And he forwarded to Billy Corgan  Yeah he's doing  I'm kind of embarrassed 
[02:17:00]  I said fucking lame bro  Fucking lame bro  Why?  I didn't expect  A for him to read it  And B that he would be on our show  Basically the next day  Fucking lame bro  Fucking lame bro  Just sit with that for a second  No one says that  Fucking lame bro  Fucking lame bro  I didn't know what else  I was like  I was really frustrated  Because I'm sick to begin with  And I'm like  I hear this whole thing going down  I'm a huge fan  I know he would be great on the show 
[02:17:30]  And I just didn't know what to tweet  So I just  Fucking lame bro  What could I have written?  Fucking lame bro  He goes  He goes to me after  He goes  Hey let's get those t-shirts made immediately  Yeah  Fucking lame bro  Fucking  Yikes  I'm an idiot  I'm a fucking idiot  But it worked in the end  Even though I tweeted something very douchey  He came in  But the Dudley guy  Who's a fan of the show  And he works for Billy Corgan's wrestling promotion 
[02:18:00]  Okay  Forwarded to Billy Corgan  And Billy wrote me back  He could have been nicer by the way  And we went back and forth  A couple tweets each  And next thing you know  He's on the show  So  Good  I'm glad  It's time that we reach out to some of these guys  That are blowing us off  In a nicer way than  Fucking lame bro  Fucking lame bro  That is one good thing about Twitter  Is you can get to the performer that way  Like they will see it  I'm one for two though  Because Mark Wahlberg never saw my Twitter  Jonah Hill did respond though  And Jonah Hill  So I  Oh that one I  Yeah we squashed that one too 
[02:18:30]  I wished him nothing but the best  Yeah  God bless  But I was frustrated with that too  I'm like really  All the other times you're on our show  And then you finally have this massive movie  And you don't  Come on  Come on  Come on  Come on  Fucking lame bro  Did you use fucking lame bro  No no no  See that might be what got Billy Corgan  Fucking lame bro  Fucking lame bro  You should just always finish it with fucking lame bro  That's right up there with Ice-Cat  Ice-Cat  But Billy was great  There's so much we wanted to ask him too 
[02:19:00]  Hopefully he'll come back  He had a crazy upbringing himself  I would love to have asked him about that  He was a cutter for a while  His parents divorced at four  His father was a drug user  His stepmother was  His stepmother was physically abusive  Wow  He has OCD a little bit  A little bit  He didn't seem like he wanted to shake hands  He didn't shake hands  He wasn't happy that I still might be a little under the weather  But I was gonna get my picture with Billy Corgan  Billy Corgan  Yeah  He was a cool guy 
[02:19:30]  What else can we say?  He was great  He was great  Now everybody on Twitter  Please thank  At Billy  For coming in  Yeah  That was awesome on his part  What a great guest man  He saw the tweet  And he was like  Fuck it  And he came in  That was awesome  Alright  Oh you hear about the Rangers guy  The Rangers announcer  Oh yeah  He had a bertation  Yeah now we just all know what a bertation is  Isn't that odd?  That just became a word  I think it has  Because she blurted it out 
[02:20:00]  I feel like we came up with the word  But no  People are just using it now  As something that happens to people  Yeah  It's become a word  It's something that happens when  Travis  Did you get a little hard that Billy Corgan was here today?  You're a big fan  It was very cool  It was really cool  That was a biggie for you  Yeah  I mean  Yeah  Yeah that was cool  I love the Smashing Pumpkins  Yeah they were great  I will now go listen to them  I guess they still are  I guess they still are  What?  They still are  I never listen to them  You should  I know who they are 
[02:20:30]  I just  I told you that whole  That whole genre of music  I just kind of missed  Yeah but they were different  That's right  You're catching up  They were  You got the Ramones  They were caught  I'm an ass  They were taught  20 years you'll be listening to the Smashing Pumpkins  But they were caught in that genre  But I didn't think they were like  Crunch  Did you?  No  No I mean they sounded  They threw them in there like  Oh Crunch bands  Pearl Jam  Nirvana  Smashing Pumpkins  It's like  No man  Well it was easy  He was doing his own thing  It was just easy to lump them in  Yeah  You know  Why?  Because they had a fuzzy guitar  Every once in a while in their songs? 
[02:21:00]  Yeah  It was popular music  At the same time  All that was coming out  Yeah it's because  Anything like rock  That replaced  You know the hair bands  Yeah  It was grunge  It was grunge  It was so easy  Just to throw everyone  In the same category  But they survived  The whole grunge thing  Yeah but then you go back  And you listen to like  You know  Any of their albums  And it's  Nothing like  Not at all  Like anyone else  Not grungy  Yeah that was very cool  It's a guy from Chicago  Hey there  This ain't  What you call  Your grunge 
[02:21:30]  Did I have that video Sam?  Yes  Sam was supposed to put  All these things on the hard drive  He never did  He's lazy  Well I can't give you  The hard drive back  And then still put videos  On the hard drive  Have you put any on there?  Oh yeah  How many?  I don't know  Two  More than five?  Yeah  When do you want it back?  When do you want the proof?  When it's full  Oh okay  Thank you  What are you getting aggressive about?  So we got the Rangers announcer  Doing a bertation 
[02:22:00]  Yeah this is their  This is their TV guy  TV guy  Yeah  I haven't heard this either  This was on  This was on Monday night  Monday night  Yeah  This discussion involving  A two to one game  The tying run at second  A leadoff single by Chase Hedlick  Go ahead run  Is at fifth  On what Adams is insisting  On calling it a botched robbery  What actually happened was  His henchman  Took a piece literally out of  Like this 
[02:22:30]  Here is cut save  There's a good pitch right there  Why does that happen to people?  Wow  Why did the other guy talk? 
[02:23:00]  Henchman  Botched robbery  Yeah nobody knows what a botched robbery is  And no one knows where fifth base is  Fifth yeah  The tying run was on fifth right?  Fifth base  Wait a minute  Fourth would be home  Fifth is first  You just keep going around  Oh I see  Okay  Is that a brain tumor?  What the fuck is that?  I don't know  I never want that  He's blaming it on lots of migraines  He said he had a magraine headache  Oh  But he's probably reading the paper open 
[02:23:30]  Botched robbery or something  Yeah I don't know what that  That's not a baseball term  No  Yeah it is  He's trying to steal  Can we hear the first part again?  This discussion involving  A two to one game  The tying run at second  A leadoff single by Chase Hedlick  Go ahead run  Is at fifth  On what Adams is insisting  On calling it a botched robbery  What actually happened was  This henchman  Took a piece literally out of 
[02:24:00]  My  Oh my god  Took a piece literally out of my  Brain  It's like what the fuck is he saying?  And he said his henchman  He wasn't saying a player's name  No  That seems like something you read in a paper  Yeah maybe  That sounds like paper  Botched robbery  His henchman  Oh my god  Whatever it was  It had nothing to do with what was going on  On the field  I was cracking the fuck up  Why?  Fucking brain tumor or something  That sounds funny  Wow  It is tobacco 
[02:24:30]  It is a Buick  It is Saturn  You know  Look at that  JFK is smiling  Goebbels new  Goebbels new  And look at that  Toasters in New York Yankee  Foot to foot  And ear to ear  Look at that  John  Petit just ain't the toaster 
[02:25:00]  I'm having a rotation  I quit talking or something  I don't know what it is or something  Little Chip Waldman  Chip Waldman  Rules  I know a botched robbery is when you get caught  You know  Oh yeah  Something gets killed  But  How he  How he said that was  Grand Union can  A Grand Union can  Someone tweeted me that 
[02:25:30]  Local news finally did something on  John Sterling's home run calls  Did you guys get that piece  Was it a complimentary piece  I don't know  That's what  Probably  But they finally said  They finally did a whole piece on  Him and his douchey home run calls  He's the color of the Yankees  I can try to find it  Yeah can you try to find that  Local news  That shouldn't be hard  I know  I think it was either 9 or 11  To be honest with you  It's fine  Cheeto leads off  There's a really bad wig  And a Muppet face on  Third  Boo 
[02:26:00]  Hey we got Warren Sapp coming in today  What is he promoting  Yeah  He's going to be in the Hall of Fame or something  What's up  He will be in the Hall of Fame  But that's not what he's promoting  What is he promoting  He's got a show on YouTube  Yeah  Called Judge Sapp  Judge Sapp  Oh really  Judge Sapp  And what's that about  It's like a people's court type show  One of these Judge Judy type shows  But he's the Judge  Has he ever gone to law school  No 
[02:26:30]  It's his own brand of justice as it were  What does that mean  I guess we're going to have to ask him  Yeah those are questions for him  Luckily you have the opportunity  Now I've seen a lot of these shows  And they've got real judges that are retired  And they really kind of lay out the law  I saw a little clip of his  There's kind of a Wheel of Fortune spinning wheel  In the courtroom  Well he was a football player  Not a judge  So he doesn't actually have any legal jurisdiction  That probably is just for fun 
[02:27:00]  Just for good clean fun  Yeah  That's what he's having  Yeah  He is wearing a robe  He was a fucking monster when he played  Yeah  That's great  Yeah  Well I can't wait to  Look he's gassing his car up in a judge robe  What's up with that  I notice a lot of black people on the  Black people are a lot of fun  Black people are a lot of fun  Black people in court shows  Like peas and carrots  Mmhmm  Mmhmm 
[02:27:30]  So is he hoping  For what?  To talk about his YouTube show  No but what is  Wait it's a YouTube show?  Yeah  Yeah it's on YouTube  Oh I thought it was on TV  No  Wow  So is he hoping maybe  He goes from YouTube to  He's  What?  He's gone  I don't know if it's related at all  But he's gone through financial difficulties  Yeah  Recently  And then what?  He just took his judge robe out of the dryer  And put it on in the laundromat  Like he's just  Ah getting ready 
[02:28:00]  Alimony payments  And he went through bankruptcy  Very recently  Sell off his  Superbowl ring  Yeah  It's depressing  Yeah  His house may go into  TMZ said his house may go into foreclosure  He owes him  Why doesn't it go into five closure?  You have a four opens ya  Two car garage  Yeah  Wait a minute  Double pink slips  I don't know if his divorce got him 
[02:28:30]  He owes six million dollars  How do you owe six million dollars?  Six million  And I think he owes like something like seven hundred thousand on his house  From before the bankruptcy that he's gotta pay  Or it's gonna go into foreclosure  How much can Judge Sap make on YouTube?  Seven hundred thousand  Coincidence  No way  I don't know  I can't imagine  The preview has two thousand eight hundred views  Yeah  Hopefully  Alright that's pretty good  Yeah  That's good right?  Ooh  No  That's not a lot 
[02:29:00]  Tell Travis it's my nine  Travis it's my nine  The John Sterling thing  My nine  I guarantee you they paint it as a colorful flavor of New York  Yeah  He's become the unpredictable  Always colorful  It's not gonna be what it should be  No  How long has this cancer been in front of a microphone?  Fuck man  Holy fuck 
[02:29:30]  Yeah I'm sure it's a very complimentary piece  Not what it should be  Yeah  Alright  Jesus Christ  I had something I was listening to on the news on the way in  I wanted to touch on  But I can't fucking remember it  Shark attacks?  No  What are they back?  Well even 1010 Winds made fun saying  Well time for another shark attack story  Oh  Which were non-stories  I guess they're saying that the sharks are in Cape Cod this year  Oh  But I guess they now have sensors or something 
[02:30:00]  Shark sensors?  So now they know when the sharks are nearby  It's not like Chief Brody up in the tower ringing the bell  No no no it's the language  Oh  That the sharks have been using  Oh  And then the guy with the voice goes  You know  We have to because it's a shark story  Here's the Jaws music  He made fun  Oh right  They do that  And he goes  I'm sure there'll be a bunch more of these shark stories as the summer hits us here  Yeah  Sounds fucking great  It was pretty amazing 
[02:30:30]  No that wasn't the story though  Oh was it?  No  The heat?  It's gonna be 100 today  Well that's true  103 maybe  How hot is LA gonna be?  I think it's warmer  Cooler in LA than it is  Oh it will be  Yeah  It was 85 on the way in today  At 5 fucking 15 in the morning  Yeah  It was 85 degrees  How hot is it out right now?  When I left the house about that time  It was just  I opened the front door  And wowie kazowie  I have to sleep with blasting air conditioning in my bedroom  So I literally have to put the blankets on myself 
[02:31:00]  Right  I put blankets on  And I'm like  Ooh it's cold out there  And then in the winter  I hate being cold  It just doesn't make any sense  We all bitch  Yes  Remember when it was really cold out  We wanted heat  Well here's the heat  Relax and enjoy it now  Yes  Who cares?  And it's really the first really hot days that we've got  Yesterday and today  Yeah  We've had it easy  Yeah  We've had a nice spring for once  But now I think we're going to get 
[02:31:30]  Spring was nice  But then  The beginning of June  A little too rainy for me  Not very happy  Not many pool days  When you've got the pool  I don't like the clouds moving in every two seconds  You know  And there's a fucking rain  Yesterday I was having a lot of fun  I purchased a little fun toy item yesterday  It's a little  A little  It's called the  The Parrot AR drone  Oh I thought it was a Vietnamese girl  No  She sets off firecrackers while I play 
[02:32:00]  Sister Christian  I'm jealous  I'm so jealous  I wish I had Jesse's girl  I'm so jealous  Wait you got a fucking line in the movie  You got a drone?  Yeah it's a little drone now  And oh there it was  A little drone  Yeah  It's a quadcopter  It's got four little rotors on it  And it's  But it's got all kinds of  That's the inside one  That's in my house  I just have that  Put the outside one on  Wait you got a 
[02:32:30]  Go to my channel  What's wrong with you?  You got an actual helicopter that you can fly more than once?  Yeah believe it or not  We broke those things  Oh I know  One ride every fucking time  This one works with an iPad as a controller  It's an iPad  And you can see the video that you're out of the camera on the front of this thing  How's the quality?  Look at the quality  We're looking at it  Oh wow  It's on Ant's YouTube channel  Going over  And I was nervous  I flew it over the pool  At very low altitude  How many feet off the water is that? 
[02:33:00]  It's about two feet off the water right there  That's pretty cool  I flew it up to the waterfall  And then I decide  I'm going up  It's going up people  How high up before you don't have control anymore?  I don't know  I could have gone higher  I went way over  So why don't you go high?  Well  And then catch the damn thing when it falls  No  It would have probably fallen in the pool  And I'm not  How high is that?  Big on  I don't know  I got it up to  That's a couple hundred feet  What?  Yeah it goes up  And I could still 
[02:33:30]  See look  You can see like  Hills and stuff back there  Is this legal?  I don't know  Because I'm thinking  I got houses all around  And I got a camera on a fucking helicopter  That I can watch  Through my iPad  I'm looking at a video  You gotta be  30 to 40 feet above your house at this point  Easily  Yeah  Maybe even more  Maybe 50 or 60  It's pretty high above the  Keep it so steady  It's  This thing has sensors on it  It's got like an altimeter sensor 
[02:34:00]  It's got sensors that detect the ground  All kinds of computerized leveling  So I could  If I let go of the iPad  No controls  It'll hover in one spot  And just stay there  No  Just stays there  And then with the iPad  You kind of move it around  And uh  Yeah  And look  See those are the  You almost feel like you're flying  Right  Yes  It's a first person view  Dude this is cool  Through the iPad  It's pretty fucking cool  This is coming back down 
[02:34:30]  I guess  Yeah now coming back  Back down  And you didn't crash it  No no  I would have crashed it  Wow  And it's the first time I flew it  It's very easy to fucking fly  So how far can you go with this?  I don't know  I haven't really shaken it down yet  What does the instruction say?  Um  I don't know  I  People are making fun  Because I didn't have my hat on  And my hair looks like Doc Brown  Yeah and then it just  And then you land  And for landing it  You just  There's a land button  So you get it close to the ground  And hit a thing that says land 
[02:35:00]  And then it lands itself  Oh instead of crashing  So you're not crashing it  You always fuck that up  Yeah the landing is the toughest part  We fucked up all these helicopters growing up  And then I did one in my house  Yeah click on that one  There  Because you could use it indoors also  Wow  Which is amazing  We're going to put this on the Facebook page  E-Rock who's shitting right now  Oh there you are  No it's up there  See here's in the house  Go to Opie and Anthony on Facebook  If you want to see the videos we're looking at  I have the camera just staring at me  And then I bring it because 
[02:35:30]  How did you not hit the ceiling?  I have very high ceilings here  In there  And I actually put it over the rail  Into the hallway  It's pretty fucking easy to fly  And the height of this  You can see Anthony  This is the view you'd have  If Anthony was about to blow you  On the sofa  Yes  That is an Anthony blowing view  Can I  Can I  I want one of these  And I want to fly around the buildings  I live at  Oh man  I'll get arrested  You probably would  You can see all these windows  Finally  I was thinking  My spy scope sucks 
[02:36:00]  Taking it to the house behind me  Where the Asian daughter  Remember  I had to look at it through the scope of the 50 cal that I have  Why didn't you go down  Now I can just do this  Why didn't you go down the street to see how far it could go  Well I didn't want to  That would be cool  I was just shaking it down at first  It was a shakedown  I didn't want it to get too far out of view  You can  You can control it  Just looking at the  The camera view  Which is really cool  So you don't even have to look at it  I sent it over my house  Wait wait wait 
[02:36:30]  So you got the iPad  I finally figured this all out  Yeah  So you're seeing what the helicopter's seeing  Yeah  And you're  Oh wow  So you can fly it like that  I flew it over my house  Where I couldn't see it anymore  And I saw my front yard  And then I brought it back over the  The top of the house  Into the backyard again  How far does it go?  You don't know  I'm not sure  I'm really not sure how far it goes  Why are you so shady about this?  Who got you this?  No no  You always think I'm involved in a conspiracy  Well something's going on  I don't know  You haven't answered one question  Oh no I have 
[02:37:00]  It's great  300  Where'd you buy it?  That's not bad  Brookstone  Really?  It's in Brookstone?  Yeah it was in Brookstone  One thing  Finely cool in Brookstone  Yeah Brookstone sucks in general  It's like  How many vibrating chairs do you need?  Oh another special pillow?  Really?  Yeah  It's  Slippers  Oh yeah  Yeah yeah  Oh great  You always walk in there  And someone sitting on those dumb vibrating chairs  Golf gadgets  Oh wow  Yeah  See I flew it right through  Between the ceiling and the railing  For the hallway 
[02:37:30]  And stuff  I'm bored with your indoor video  I like the outdoor one  Yeah outdoor is a lot better  Because you're  Indoor is just hard to do  You're seeing the rooftops of all your neighbors  That's crazy  I could hover that thing right in front of a window  If I wanted to  And it doesn't tell you how high it could go?  Someone call  I don't  I didn't look  I really didn't look  And I didn't want to take it to the limit of how high it could go  Take it to the limit  And you can preset how high it can go  The max  So it doesn't get out of hand  I would have bought two  Yeah  Oh okay  Keep one in the box 
[02:38:00]  And then you try out the other one  And just give it  Give it the real test  See how high that fucker will go  Give it the real test  And what happens if you go out of the range?  I wonder if it has a system in it where it goes  It does  It's going to drop  But it's going to figure itself out  It will hover  And then lower itself down to six feet high  And just stay there until it regains your signal  Wow  Wow  It's got various things to adjust  You can adjust how fast it climbs up and down  How high it actually goes 
[02:38:30]  So you can make it so it will never go higher than ten feet if you want  Right  Or you know max  You can  Whatever angle it's going to be on  So it doesn't go on a crazy angle forward and really go fast  You can adjust all of that stuff  I want to buy one for the city  That would be really cool  They have videos online of people buzzing it through Central Park and shit  Sheep Meadow  Yeah  Looks pretty cool in Manhattan  But it was fun  I was just fucking around with it yesterday  First time  And I was able to fly it around pretty well 
[02:39:00]  It's not like a regular helicopter where it's really hard to fucking fly  I think it's impossible  And the camera's really steady on it and stuff  Yeah so I was doing that yesterday  In the heat  In the blazing heat  I was jumping through shitty sprinklers with my kid  That's what we get in New York  Oh by the way  Buy three batteries or four batteries with extra batteries  Keep them in the charger  What do you get  While you're doing it  Double D's  You probably get at the most 15 minutes of flight time on a battery 
[02:39:30]  That's it  That's it  So why don't they give you a good battery  Well it is a good battery  That's a good battery  That's all they could squeeze out of it  There's so much shit going on with the thing  I guess it eats up a lot of battery  Why don't you just get like a long cord or something  Yeah  Yeah  A long cord  Get a gas powered one  Yeah right  Warren Sapp is walking down the hall by the way  So  Oh is he?

[02:45:30]  Are you a guy that'll  Say something on the street  When you see a hot chick  Walking by  You know what?

You've never chosen a woman  Neither one of us  All four of us fellas  Who think we're so smooth  And suave  And never near  We've never chosen a woman  Even the one that you want to marry  You get on your knees  Set up the night  Into a nice 
[02:46:30]  You know probably  A Caribbean island somewhere  Get you a nice ring  At least three carats  You know all dressed up nice  And you're going to get on your knees  And ask  And if she says no  You got to get your ass up  And dust yourself off  And go find another one  Because she don't want you  You've never chosen a woman  In your life  They choose us  They always choose us  Well you were  You went through a  Are you back  You've been living that whole time  You didn't know it?

[02:47:00]  You just have to be  Standing there brother  Trust me  Damn  I learned something  From Warren Sapp  Would you get remarried?  Every day I learn something  Would you get remarried?  Absolutely  Oh you would?  I'm not dying alone  I answered for you  I'm not dying alone  Well you would do it again  Yes  I did 10 years  Almost 10 years  See it sounded like a prison sentence  Exactly what I did  Almost 10 years  And will I ever get married again?  Will you do it?  No  Never again  He wouldn't get married again  I swear  Let me guess  You have no soft companion at night  You go home to a couch 
[02:47:30]  And a television  And direct TV  No marriage though  So you won't show up as  What's that man's name?  Phil Shifley  At your own  Yeah right  At my own funeral  I have direct TV too  But I need something soft  For Saif  Absolutely  Direct TV is beautiful  With all the channels  But something soft for Saif  That's good  But you don't have to marry her  God damn man  I lost so much fucking money  Because of that  God damn divorce  It's always cheaper to keep her  It's always cheaper to keep her  No doubt  Oh man  You never know that  Until you actually let go  But yeah  Wow 
[02:48:00]  I'll second that  Amen brother  Oh yeah  Amen brother  Oh man  Did she rake you over the coals?  Nah I pretty much gave it up  You think you're gonna be a good guy  Take care of her  The kids  Nah it never stops  Me and you in the same boat brother  I felt you  He didn't have kids or a house though  And he got killed  No I was just starting to make money too  And I went to the bank  Because I was gonna take out  Half the money  And leave her half  Oh you were gonna do this yourself  I was gonna go  You know what  I'm gonna go to the bank  I was a witness  I swear  I'm gonna take out half the money 
[02:48:30]  And you know  I'm not gonna let  She took half of that  What was left right  No I went to the bank  To take half the money out  It was already all gone  She took it all  She beat him to the bank  I'm like man  Took it all  Left you a dollar seventy wasn't it  I'll say it to you fellas again  You didn't choose her  She chose you  They already have it laid out  Like if you're trying to catch a woman cheating  You have to plan for two years  And get all her friends involved  Cause they already have it mapped out  They're smarter than us  They can multitask 
[02:49:00]  Did you feel ironic  That your last name was Sap  At the time of your divorce  No I got two piece  Double your pleasure  Double your pleasure  He's kind of answering for that  I've been asking for everything  I've been asking for everything  I've been asking for everything  I've been asking for everything  I've been asking for everything  I've been asking for everything  Exactly  Alright I'm gonna watch this YouTube show  Oh that hurt  Listen  Now I'm gonna watch this show  You have to watch this  I'm telling you  YouTube.com  Slash the knock  Real cases  Alright I gotta ask you three fellas  Cause I do this all the time  Do y'all know what a testicular inversion is  Uh oh  Whoa 
[02:49:30]  Uh huh  I got some eyes up  I woke you up in that  I'll tell you one thing  Sounds painful  Wait wait let's guess  A testicular inversion  Yes  Does that mean they're inside  Because a woman kicked them inside you  There you go  You get kicked in the Johnny Coffin  And they go inside  That's one of the cases  Yeah and it's supposed to go  And it's supposed to be pleasurable  As I understand it  From this jiu-jitsu teacher  That came into my courtroom  I'm telling you  These are real people  We had a guy on our show  Probably ten years ago now  He got kicked in the balls  Over and over and over again  We were amazed 
[02:50:00]  How many shots this guy  My stomach is hurting  Just to think about it  We were amazed  But it only hurts  A couple of seconds later  She didn't hold  She didn't hold back either  No no no  She was nailing him in the nuts  And this guy loved it  Listen to me  This young lady  That was standing in front of me  In my courtroom said  Your honor  I kick ass for a living  And I kick it good  She a dominatrix  Yes  She said sometimes  I get a running start  Yeah we saw this  It's called ball busting  It's called ball busting  They love it  Guys love it  No  I mean buddy came  And was like  I had a safe word  I say  That lets me know right there 
[02:50:30]  You want to go too far  If you're going somewhere  And paying for a service  And you need a safe word  Yeah yeah  You had way too  Did you ever have a mishap  With a cup or anything  Where it didn't work  And you got hit  That's only in baseball  Oh yeah  Is it  A jock does everything  You need in the football  Really  That's why we don't wear  Tie pads  And any of the other stuff  You know  Waist down you good  Yeah you never  An errant elbow  When you fucking  Get nailing  No a knee in the bottom  Of the power  Like that  That'll happen to you  Wow  Just hurt my stomach 
[02:51:00]  Yeah again right  I'm telling you man  If the wind blows hard  You know brother  I'll shrivel up  And run in the corner  Come on man  Now what kind of credentials  Do you have as a judge sir  Wait a minute  We're questioning you  Wait a minute  I'm questioning  You're questioning  My common sense  And my ability  To dispense fair justice  Never  Never your common sense  I don't care for that  I've been in a locker room  Full of 80 men  Oh  You know what I'm saying  Don't bring sexy  Into this conversation  Wow  They say one and four  Now I see why 
[02:51:30]  Now I see why  I didn't know guys  Actually thought that way  You know  Normally you go to  The Northwest  You hear  Pause  Pause  Like  Who pushed play  That's all I wanted  Who pushed play  So I'm saying now  But no  You never had soap battles  What was it called  Sandusky's soap battles  You never had soap battles  Sandusky's going to jail  Oh yeah  A football locker room  Is pleasure  I love how he was good  And didn't need to  Take the stand  You don't have to be  I'm good  I'm good  I'm good  He didn't ever touch the boys  But I didn't go down  Those steps and see 
[02:52:00]  Yeah I didn't look  But I don't think  He was touching them  You don't have to be  A YouTube judge  To know he's going to jail  Sandusky  That's for sure  Sandusky makes it sound  Like all you guys  Just have fun in the shower  And it's normal behavior  Sir  You know what  That's why it's called  A sickness  Yeah  That's why it's called  A sickness  Yeah we fucking hate  The guy  Trust me  Oh trust me  We'll joke about it  A little bit  But we hate the guy  I hope he burns in hell  You got it  Oh absolutely  Three times over  You know  Hang him on I-95  And let me have a bad day  And go by and thump him  On the nuts or something  You know  That's what I think 
[02:52:30]  Should happen to him  But he's going to get it  He's going to get it  You're really like  A high energy  Like fun guy  And you have a great reputation  Yeah  But  But not if you're on  The other side  Not like  What  Like when you're  Playing against you  What is it that just  Turns that for you  And takes all this  Fun energy  And just turns it  Into this  The ability to do  What it was you did  For so long  I wanted to chase  The great ones  I wanted to chase  The Joe Greens  The you know  Randy Weiss  The Bob Lillies  The bad boys  That played this game 
[02:53:00]  Well before me  And I had a standard  Every guy I faced  Was Larry Allen  I just shaved his team  Off of his side  Of his helmet  Made him bland  That's Larry Allen  Was Larry the toughest one?  Oh my god  Him and Randall McDaniel  Jimmy talks about Larry Allen  I love Larry Allen  Because I was a Cowboy fan  Yeah  Jimmy talks about him  All the time  Yeah  He was a very underrated  Most people don't know  Who he is  No he wasn't underrated  No but I mean  Everyone knows  Who Emmett was  Oh of course  But they don't know  Who Larry Allen is  It was Larry Allen  And Stefanovski  And Eric Williams  And Nate Newton  Nate Newton  And two and they  That made that thing go  You know the Cowboys 
[02:53:30]  Ran six plays  Really?  And then flipped it  So now they had 12  That was it  We're not building  Rockets out there  Trust me  If you can't stop it  It's coming back  We got to hear  A lot of Larry Allen stories  Because we got to know  One of the Cowboys  Oh my god  What was the one  Where he would  Spit in his Mercedes  He said that he had  A tobacco chewer  And he drove a Benz  And would just spit  In the passenger seat  On the rug  Like he just didn't  Give a fuck  He was one of those guys  Unbelievable  Listen if you've ever  Hung around Larry Allen  From Sonoma State 
[02:54:00]  He doesn't  He doesn't care  I mean he's just  A whole country boy  That just does  What he does  But he was a hard dude  To go up against  The best  The best  I ate that cookie  The best  The best  He was  How about Eric Williams  Did you ever play him  Before the car accident  You know what  It was so funny  That Jesse Armstead  Used to bring him down  To the University of Miami  Right before the car accident  And I used to look at him  And say  I'd eat that up  And he'd look at me  Like what  He's just a kid 
[02:54:30]  You know I told Dan Marino  All that all the time too  When I was in Miami  I'd say  I'd knock you out  He's like  I'd shake your big ass  And this is after the Achilles  I'm like  Dan you carried a boot around  He's like  I'd still shake your big ass  So you know  You pay homage  To the great ones  That played the game  But I wanted a lot  Of Eric Williams  But boy  He was something tough  You know  Reggie White  God bless his soul  Bits so much  That that's the hands  To the face  That's why Justin Tuck  Has that damn face mask  That he has now  Brilliant idea  About Tuck too  Wasn't Reggie  Wasn't Eric Williams 
[02:55:00]  He was the under the neck  He was an under the neck guy  In his face  Yeah  He used to punch Reggie  In his face  That's why  That's why you can't  Put your hand  In the defender's face  Is because of Eric Williams  Beating on Reggie White  Yeah he was the one guy  Reggie White was so great  But Eric Williams  Just  Every game  He could do nothing  That must be great  When they have to make a rule  Because of you  Because it's something you did  Can't stretch  Can't jog  And you know  Skip through people's stretch  At the beginning of the game 
[02:55:30]  Oh apparently not  Yeah yeah  I mean  It was my direct route to work  You know  I learned this in physics class  They said  The fastest distance  Between any two points  Is a straight line  So I used to go  Straight across the field  I mean  Isn't this all mine  This is Tampa Stadium  This is mine  This is Warren's house  I get to go where I got water  Go  Catch a little shit for it  I did  Were they saying anything to you  As you actually went through  The Steelers did  Yeah  The Steelers were actually chasing me  But I wasn't even paying  Any attention  I mean  It was funny 
[02:56:00]  It was classic  But Tony Dungy knew  In the six years before that  When he was with me  That I went that route  So when he put his team out there  On Monday Night Football  The stretch  He knew I was coming through there  He was laughing about it  We actually had a laugh about it  I was like  Coach  He was like  I knew you were coming  He said  But I knew you  Wasn't going to touch anybody  You were going to go right through  And go to your corner  That's what you always did  So  Know the nature of the beast  You're never surprised  By what it does  What's all this thing about too  The hits and stuff like that 
[02:56:30]  Is that overplayed  Or the bounties  Has that been stretched out  By the media  Or is that the way it was  You know what  I want to say  That that was an isolated incident  Because the men that I played for  The Tony Dungy's  Herman Edwards  You know  Rob Marinelli  Lovett Smith  Mike Tomlin  Those are all my defensive coaches  Down in Tampa  And it would have been hard  For me to sit in that room  And listen to Greg  Weehan's talking about  You know  Taking somebody out  You know  In the whole  The build up to it  Because  It starts pretty mundane 
[02:57:00]  Then it grows  Because you know  The greater  The bigger the game  The more the stakes  On the line  So  But I know this  In being in enough locker rooms  There was no way  For anybody in that room  To go against him  Oh right  Because in a true military sense  If you stood up in that room  And said  This is wrong  I don't want a part of this  You got stamped  With a dishonorable discharge  And where the hell  You going to get another job  He's the guy  And you got to follow  What he says  What the hell  Are you going to get another job  When you won't follow  The direction of your  Defensive coordinator 
[02:57:30]  Whether the team  Put you on their team  Pay you millions of dollars  To do this  Wow  That's the dilemma  When you sit in that room  Do I cut my nose  To spite my face  Just following up  It's coming from the top  It's coming from the top  It's coming from the front of the room  I want to know  How do I  As an employee of this  Stop it  You'd probably need  The entire team  No  What you would need  Because the NFL  Walked to the  The owners in  The Saints organization  In 09  And said  If this is going on 
[02:58:00]  Stop it  Right  But they want to tell you  It's about the players  Then what point  Did you go to the players  And say  If this is going on fellas  It's going to fall on your heads  That's all you got to do  Is say  Shit rolls downhill  It's going to fall on your lap  And it would have stopped  At that point  Because  Now you give the players  A vehicle in which to go  Against the  The authoritative figures  That are over them  They never went to the players  They never  They never introduced  The players  Association  And said  Go down there  And talk to these players  If this is going on  We needed to stop 
[02:58:30]  Because  We're on the direction  Of the head coach  The GM  And the D coordinator  How do I go against  The people that are  Paying my salary  And feed my family  You can't  You don't  Because you would never  Get another job in this league  So  Did you say  Did you say  Jeremy Shockey  Was  He was kind of  The guy that came out  Was that incorrect  I know only half of that story  That's why I'm asking you  You only know half the story  You only read a little bit of it  That's it  I will go around  Different around  The thing was  A source told me  What that was 
[02:59:00]  And the thing I did  I brought it on a street level  And brought it down  With the word snitch  And that's what I apologized for  Oh you did apologize  No no  I told Jeremy  Right to his face  At a heat game  In the back  I saw him face to face  Because I put it on  A negative connotation  On something that  We're sitting here  Talking about  How do you stop it  You see what I'm saying  So how do you stop something  That it pretty much  Going to cost you your job  And you'll never have another job  Because Vilma and Hargrove  How do you sign a dude  To your team  That's not going to be there  For the first eight weeks  He don't make my team  Yeah 
[02:59:30]  I can't count on him  For the first eight games  Of the year  And if I put him  On my roster  Week one  That guarantees his salary  Because he's a vested veteran  Oh really  If you put him on week one  You got to  You got to take care of him  For the entire time  Exactly  So he don't make a week one  Roster  How do you put him  On your team  He's gone for eight weeks  And how you got to  Bring a guy back  That's eight weeks  And into a middle of a season  Shh  Shit  Shit 
[03:00:00]  Shit  Shit  We're fans of the wire  You love the wire?  Love  Love the wire  You hated the wire  I grew up in the 90s  With drive-by shooting  And drug dealing  Was an actual  Day in day out  Life for me  I don't want to watch it  On television  It's a documentary  Some dumbass  That's telling a story  No thanks  I'll tell you  It's fun for Whitey  I kind of figured that  Fun for us  Where'd you go up? 
[03:00:30]  Right outside Orlando  A small town  That doesn't exist anymore  It used to be Plymouth, Florida  But now it's Apocalypse  It was a rough neighborhood  No  It was country  That was the thing  That's why I didn't go to Florida State  Because Bobby Bowen  You know  It was the 90s  Drive-by shootings and everything  So he thought I lived in like the ghetto  I'm like  I'm a country boy  I got 250 people in my town  We don't even have a stoplight  No McDonald's  I mean  This ain't no gang related up in here  I mean  We don't have enough people to form a gang  You know  I'm the baby of six  There's more people in my family  That'll fight 
[03:01:00]  In this town  It was crazy  So  It's just one of those deals  I'm just a country boy  Why is  Why is Florida such a great football state?  It's 80 degrees at 8 o'clock in the morning  Yeah but there's other states that are warm and shit  Which one?  Arizona  Arizona  I mean it's like LA  They don't do immigration laws very well out there  I don't like the brown man  A lot of good football comes out of Florida though man  It's just what it is  I mean  We're talking about a lot of dirt  Muck  You know  Down in Belglades  That muck  With thick sand  And that's what we run in 
[03:01:30]  So  Right  And we run all year long  I mean  Y'all love basketball up here in New York  I mean  Love basketball  Lacrosse  And  Baseball  You can't play baseball in Florida  In the middle  What?  That's why they have spring training in Florida  And they get the hell out of there  Yep  You'll die in the middle of the day  At 100 degrees  With that humidity  But running around  On a football field  Seems to be worse than playing baseball  If you're a kid  No  Nah that's a man's sport  That's a man's sport  Fair enough  It's a man's sport  Well you get a round ball  With a round bat 
[03:02:00]  I know they say  That's the toughest thing to do  But  It's boring as hell  Yeah you just stand around half the time  Exactly  If you ain't the pitcher  You ain't working  The pitcher or the catcher  You ain't working  Right  I used to be a first baseman  Excellent  Power hitting first baseman  That played excellent defense  Just the game was too damn slow  Really?  Even for the players  Yeah  Just too damn slow  If it wasn't a left handed batter  I did nothing  I forget  Yeah yeah  They did some kind of experiment  They said  There's five or six minutes of action  In a baseball game  Something like that  I forgot the exact number 
[03:02:30]  But it's so ridiculously low  Absolutely  You do nothing  I mean a two  Two and a half hour game  And it's like  The actual action  Is five six minutes  Something  Well the average NFL player  Is six seconds too  Yeah but that's an intense  Six seconds  Every single fucking time  You're gonna make some contact  You're gonna lose your head  I guarantee that  Not lose your head  It ain't life or death  You can keep banging your head  Up against a wall  And realize there's a wall  Twenty years later though  I don't understand  Oh yeah  I don't understand how you get  Tangled up every play  And you guys  You're really not tangled 
[03:03:00]  You don't have more injuries  When you're in the bottom  Of that pile  Trying to figure out  How the fuck to get back up  On your feet  Make sure the running back  Is on the bottom  You're on top of him  Or the quarterback  Or the guard  Or the tackle  Make sure you ain't at the bottom  You guys gotta be  Partly insane to play  Absolutely  You gotta be  Gotta have a screw loose  It's a contact sport  Yeah  How good does it feel  To just nail  A running back  Like when  Especially  No quarterback  Oh the quarterback's the best  Trust me  The girls are watching him 
[03:03:30]  He's nice and pretty  Standing in the pocket  Take it right off the mouth  Oh he likes that  Y'all just gave me a flashback  He likes that  It feels good  Just to feel that full contact  That tingling right now  That tingling right now  That oof  When he hits the ground  And the air comes out  And that's better than  When you're going around  The back dragged down  I mean  No don't drag him down  You want to grab him  And bounce  Bounce 
[03:04:00]  Oh man  Throw him down a little bit  Bounce  You want to bounce on him  Wow  Do they over protect him  By like  Or is it necessary  They do  They do  They over protect him  I mean  First of all  They made it a strike zone  From the  Top of the numbers  To the bottom of the numbers  Is basically where you can hit it  Not the legs  No  You hit him in the legs  You're done  Do you name  Do you name  Do you name players  Who did you like to hit the most  They all taste like chicken  It wasn't  You didn't have a number one  Tastes like chicken  No  It was Favre because 
[03:04:30]  When Dungy got there  Favre was a three time MVP  In my own division  And a world champion  So  That felt good  To take him down  If we wanted to  That felt good  No  If we wanted to pull Tambor out of the basement  We had to pass Green Bay  So  Dungy made him the target  So it was easy for me  He did great for the Jets  So  What did the Jets do  Just end the season  Huh  What did the Jets do  Just end the season  How was he there last year  Two years ago  He's been  Y'all were nine and three  And the wheels came off  Right  Or am I missing something  That's exactly right  I thought so 
[03:05:00]  What do you think of Tebow  You know what  He's a hard guy to figure out  Right  Very hard to figure out  Because  You want to follow him  I mean  I'm like everybody else  I mean you love his enthusiasm  I'm a Jets fan  So I'm like  I understand  I understand  And you're like  I'm not sure  I know you're not sure  Because  When you see him  As a football player  You're like  But I understand  The heroics  If I can just get  The heroics  Without the 55 minutes  Of bad football  It'll be okay  Just give me the end result  You know  Don't tell me about the labor 
[03:05:30]  Give me the baby  I understand where you at  At this point  Because when he gets it done  Man he makes it exciting  Here's the question  I have for all Jets fans  Yes  We were told  Mark Sanchez has it  That's why we moved up  To draft him right  Tim Tebow has it  When it versus it  What it wins out  Tebow  Sanchez doesn't have  The confidence  Tebow has  You can have confidence  But you need skill  To play this game  Because we all think  We walk on water  No doubt about it  I promise you  Even the 53rd dude 
[03:06:00]  On the roster  Thinks he walks on water  Because he's less than  2% of the population  So the confidence is there  Nobody on the NFL  Football roster  Is lacking for confidence  You made it there  But Sanchez has a whole  Head game thing  Happening it seems  It's going to split  The locker room  I think first home game  I think they start  Cheering for Tebow  Even though Sanchez  Hasn't even fucking  Taken one snap  Listen he has to  Mess it up  He's got to mess it up  And if he doesn't  Then that puts him  In a situation  Where it's going to 
[03:06:30]  Work itself out  On the football field  It's weird  But you got to  You got to question  A team that was  65% in the red zone  With Plexico  And no Tebow  You get rid of Plex  And bring Tebow in  What'd I miss  What a miss  At this point  What body of work  Are we watching  The backup  Fly across the country  On a jet  And then have a press conference  I was blown away  The backup  The backup  I mean this is the backup  My backup never played  I don't even know  His name 
[03:07:00]  I know my backup  In college  He was the Rock  You know  Because he pretty  He became pretty famous  But most backups  Become nothing  Right  You know  Unless he's  Lou Gary  And Wally Pitt  Who was your backup  In college  Dwayne  The Rock  Oh  Dwayne Johnson  Oh you said  Rock  Yeah Dwayne Johnson  Played college football  Man  Was he good  We've all seen him  In the uniform  But was he actually  A good college football player  Tell me he was okay  When he first got there  From Pennsylvania  He was in the Big 33  Yeah  He was up in  Western PA  And all of that  But  Never really happened 
[03:07:30]  Obviously  He had a couple injuries  Shoulder  And some couple things  Broke down on him  But other than that  He's a great dude though  I love him  Great dude  Not a great football player  But it doesn't matter  He's a great entertainer  And an actor  And the most electrifying man  I think it'll work out for him  I think he's gonna be alright  Yeah  I think that kid  I think that kid's gonna be okay  What's the one  He's in 20 million  In a movie now  Yeah  I think he's gonna be alright  I thought he wanted to carry  A cameo Dewey  I used to let you play  He's an A-lister  You know what  He used to ask me  How much time can I get this week  I'm like listen man  I'm gonna go ahead  And get these two sacks 
[03:08:00]  I'm gonna come out  It's all yours  Now I just need a cameo Dewey  That's all  Hook your boy up  You should be in movies  You getting those opportunities yet  You know I did  Our family wedding  You know  Was my first one  But other than that  Listen  This is what I tell people all the time  When I walk into these  Readings for movies  I'm looking at Terry Tate  The office linebacker  There go Faison  Who's got 20 movies  Underneath his belt  I'm a football player  I rush to pass it  That's like them coming 
[03:08:30]  To try to take my job  It ain't gonna happen  Right  I mean come on  I'm in a whole different field  So  But you got charisma  I know but  I have a good time  I like to have a good time  I have a good time  You know  I like to have a good time  But the director  Or the producer  Or whoever it is  Has to give it to me  I'm not gonna out act  A person that has 20 movies  Underneath his belt  Right  Did you like Dancing with the Stars  I loved it  You did huh  You did well  I think you were runner up  Weren't you  Yeah I got called up  My little girl's a big fan  And at the time  She was 10  So I walked in the living room 
[03:09:00]  We were on our way to China  For some singing gigs  She had with kids  You know  Got to visit China  Pretty cool  Great wall  One of the 8th wonders  7th wonders  So I walk in  My ex-wife  Well wife at the time  And I say  Dancing with the Stars  You know  I got off the phone  And he was asking me about it  So I come in and ask her  I didn't look left  The little girl's on the couch  Down there hiding  She jumped over the couch  And said  You doing it  And ran upstairs  And called both grandmas  So that was the discussion  Of how am I doing  Dancing with the Stars  Oh so then you have to  So then I get that week one 
[03:09:30]  You know  Do the little cha-cha  I feel good about it  You know  Me and Kim  Great chemistry  Both got sidekicks  Both fear heights  All the little quirky things  About a person  We both feel the same way  About it  So we have a beautiful  Relationship  My little girl  Comes to this first show  I dance pretty good  Or whatever  You know  Everybody loving it  She looks at me  After the show  And she said  Daddy  You know my birthday  Is on the finals week  I looked at my little girl  I said  Baby daddy was thinking  About being here  About six weeks  Six weeks 
[03:10:00]  Nothing  We champions  And ran out of the door  Just turned around  And walked off from me  So now I have  A ten year old little girl  That I gotta go dance for  Oh man  So when you saw me  On television  You were dancing your ass off  Thank you  I was dancing for a ten year old  At home  That didn't want to hear  Nothing but we champions  I'm like  God  I hate the one time  That I stuck excellence  In her face  You thought it would be fun  For a couple weeks  Kind of a goof  Whatever  Because I was looking  At the list  You know  I'm like  Tony Braxton 
[03:10:30]  Lance Bass  You know  These are dancing people  That entertain  You know  I'm a big man  That hunt quarterbacks  You know  This ain't my field  Oh you were  The same cast  As Cloris Leachman  And Jeff Ross  And our pal Jeff Ross  Yeah  Holy fuck  Okay  Got poked in the eye  And couldn't make it  Yep  Oh that's right  I wore my patch  For solidarity for him  I remember that  I like Jeff  I remember that  So you went to the fight  I think  You came in second  Didn't you  I lost yeah  Did you know you lost  As the both dances happened  Or were you really not sure 
[03:11:00]  No  At the end of the day  When we came back  The next day  Because trust me  As hard as we danced  They party just as hard  Yeah  I love them  And Monday nights  After you dance  Yeah  It's a good time  It's a good time  It's a good time  A little libation  We have a good time  So the thing about it  We come back the next night  And after  They decide it  The dude walks up to me  And he has this long look  On his face  I'm like  What's the matter  He's like  Dude you lost by 0.36% 
[03:11:30]  Of the vote  Oh shit  It's like 50,000 votes  I looked at him  I said  Good  He said what  I said  Because there's no way  I was going to be  Walking around  With that beer ball trophy  Going from The View  To  Come on  Oh shit  Can you imagine that  Yeah  Yeah  They put you out  On the tour  The tour  Yeah  You actually got to dance  A couple other places  Oh man  Trust me  My feet were killing me  5'8 studs  They never look so good  After those  Those Latin shoes  I wanted my 5'8 
[03:12:00]  Back  He's back so bad  Oh my god  Jeez  We haven't even talked about  The show on YouTube  Well I mean a little bit  We did I guess  Judge Sapp  But I imagine  It's a comedy  And it's obviously  You're not a judge  But is it just kind of  It's your personality  You said what  I got my robe  And my gavel  And I'm in my courtroom  Why ain't I the judge  No I wasn't saying that  I said obviously  You're a real judge  So I  You can knock his teeth out  He's close to it  Okay good  We would understand  I used to be a  Growling grizzly bat  I don't have any claws anymore 
[03:12:30]  I don't maul people  Oh really  Yeah you can grab him  And hug him  And shake him now  He's  I think a slap  From Warren Sapp  Would be horrible enough  You want to take one  No  No  Jimmy takes moves  From UFC  I'm not aggressive at all  Sunday's over  Yeah  I used to have a lot of fun  Sunday's are over  I had to get out of that  I had a three hour license  To kick ass  It's been almost five years  I got a good question  How did you get out of that mindset  Where you're just chilling out  You gotta let go  You just let it go  But how  I bet you it was hard at first  The dancing with the stars  Really helped 
[03:13:00]  Because  If they don't watch  Monday night football  Guess what else  They're not watching  Sunday football  Because  We look for Sunday  To get to Monday right  I mean it's just a process  And if you don't watch  Monday night  When there's only one game on  You definitely ain't watching  When they're 16  All right  Trust me  There's a whole different audience  There's grandma  Moms  Aunties  You know  There's a whole different  Spectrum  I mean  It's fun  You loved it right  Oh my god  These ladies grab me on the street 
[03:13:30]  And be like  Twirl me  Take me for a spin  And be like  Okay  Always back on the left  Let's go  Take off  So much fun  To be able to dance  How hard was it to walk away  From football  I mean I'm sure you've heard  That question before  But I mean  When did you know  Like oh it's time to  You win 15 games  In four years in Oakland  It became a job  Oh okay  It's just that simple  I've always said  Football is a kid's game  You get paid a king's ransom  And when it stopped  Being fun  I was gonna leave  And it stopped being fun  In Oakland  When you come into a job 
[03:14:00]  Where nobody says  Good morning  Nobody cares about  Their responsibility  On the field  It's about how much money  You're gonna get paid  And how much  Somebody else is making  I mean they broke  All the rules in Oakland  Wow really  All the rules  You don't discuss  Wives, kids, and money  Everything was being discussed  And I'm like  I can't do this  And then  I think it was about  Week 13  I was sitting in my locker  And you know  I had told myself  I was gonna retire  At the end of the year  But I was still contemplating  Because I knew I could play  I watched these two kids 
[03:14:30]  Have a 15 minute conversation  Right beside me  And I did not understand a word  I said I gotta go  Wow  I said I'm sitting in the locker room  Listening to a conversation  For 15 minutes  And have no idea  What they're talking about  I gotta go  What were they talking about  What was the subject  I thought they were talking about  Like  Going out  And you know  Doing some things  But it was a girl  They were talking about a girl  I'm like  That conversation  Was about a female  Wow  He's like  Yeah dog  What you talking about  Wow  I'm dumbfounded 
[03:15:00]  Did you feel old  Yep  You did  I really did  I felt like I had  Missed a generation  Some kind of way  Wow  Because the generation  That I grew up with  The Hardy Nickisons  And the Reggie Weiss  And the Martin Mayhills  And Barney Bussies  You know  Those are old school guys  You had to earn their respect  You had to earn it  On the football field  This was a  Same shit we talked about earlier  You gotta anoint me  The next great one  Right now  Right  And don't waste time  And they haven't even  Done anything yet  Entitlement

Yep  The O.P. and Anthony show  Is pretty much over  But if you feel like sticking around  After O.N.A. Live  Is next  Sirius XM  Hey hey hey  And now  The O.P. and Anthony show  Continues  This is After O.N.A. Live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  Oh yeah  Oh you should stay 
[03:19:30]  What do you mean you gotta go?  I only came in for Billy Corgan  I could have easily taken a week off  No one would have noticed  I would have noticed  No one  The listeners wouldn't have noticed  That's not true  The O.N.A. studio wouldn't have noticed  And management would  Wouldn't have noticed  Are you happy to be back?  I came back for Billy Corgan  What about Warren Sapp?  You know what?  Warren fucking ruled  He definitely brought up the energy  If you listen to the replay  You'll hear me  But 
[03:20:00]  You'll hear me  Openly mocking him  Yeah  But then I went  Wait a minute  Why am I doing this?  This guy's really cool  So I stopped  I like Warren  He was loud  He was loud  Which  When someone's loud  You don't know how to take it  So I decided to mock  And then I went  No this is a good loud  Is that considered building a bridge?  Uh  Rebuilding a bridge?  Why is it rebuilding?  I met Warren Sapp for the first time  That means we're laying the groundwork  For a brand new bridge  Because you burnt the bridge 
[03:20:30]  When you started mocking him  And then you decided to stop mocking him  Before you noticed  Therefore the bridge was rebuilt  I fucked up the groundbreaking ceremony  For the bridge  Oh I see  You tripped on your way to cut the ribbon  Yeah exactly  But we're good  I like Warren Sapp a lot  Billy Corgan amazing  Fucking we didn't even get to talk to him  About half the shit we wanted to  Because it was just a good conversation for an hour  I can't believe he's a wrestling fan  He told me outside  Alright well  I'm glad you're feeling better  I'm 75% 
[03:21:00]  I could have taken today and tomorrow off  Yeah but I'm glad that you didn't  And you shouldn't  These motherfuckers better appreciate something  The audience missed you  I missed you  Roland missed you  Sal was cursing you out while you were gone  Yeah  Who else missed me though?  E-Rock did not miss you  I got it out before he slammed the door didn't I?  Hang on Roland  Let me turn on your mic and everything  I gotta get over to the board  Sometimes when  I hope he stays a little later  I can't get over there  Hang on one second  Hang on  Hang on  Wait a minute 
[03:21:30]  I'm almost there  Okay here I am  After Opie and Anthony live  Roland  Yes  Big guest day for you  Yeah  And also did you want to play with Eric's autographed football?  Can I toss it to you?  Yeah I guess  Whoa I have butterfingers  You dick  What's wrong Eric?  That's not even from me  Uh oh  Roland  Nice spiral  Roland  Roland just spiked 
[03:22:00]  Spiked it  He's throwing it at the garbage can  Eric what's going on?  Uh oh  Eric just took his headphones off  He's running in here Roland  He's pissed  Eric is pissed  Right here  Oh he's rubbing his ass with it  Eric is fucking pissed  Oh and he threw it back in the garbage  Eric you  Uh oh  Uh oh  What the hell were you?  Uh oh  Eric are you pissed?  Are you pissed?  Oh no  Eric how pissed are you right now?  He threw out his coffee  Oh you  Ladies and gentlemen 
[03:22:30]  That was not Eric's autographed football  I'm still drinking  Eric  That's funny  You got me  What happened?  You got me  It wasn't your football was it?  Whose was this?  No I got  I just got one sign  I had an extra  Roland told me right before we went on the air  He goes  Hey Sam  You know what we should do?  I got an extra football  He goes  I'm going to throw it to you  Let's play catch  And pretend it's Eric's football  I go okay  I knew that would draw you out  But you were smart too because I was looking the way you held it  I saw the 
[03:23:00]  You held it like this  Yeah so you can see the black  So the print that's on there looks like that it was a signature from the distance  How pissed were you when you thought of  Oh he was mad  I was upset but it wasn't my thing that's why  I saw  Well you would have been pissed if it was your thing too  Yeah but I wouldn't have gotten as upset because it was for somebody else  I saw the look on your face though and it was like the look of like I want to kick his ass  But I can't do anything physical to him I don't know what to do with my anger  So I shoved my hand in his coffee  Yeah  His iced coffee  And Roland was like 
[03:23:30]  Roland wanted to tell you  Don't throw out my coffee  It's not really your ball  Alright  Well that was funny  What did you learn on the show today Eric?  I think it's pretty much what everyone else thought about Billy Corgan  That you thought he was going to be a bit more like mellow and shy and reserved with the interview  But he was he was fucking great  You know why I had confidence?  Because I and you know I originally a long time ago I thought Billy Corgan was kind of an 
[03:24:00]  You know kind of an artsy fartsy type of quiet subdued type of person  But then I found out he was a giant wrestling fan  Yeah  And it's like  You've been talking about that for all week  I mean it's crazy  Because when you find that out you're like okay well you can't be that subdued  You can't be that  Another thing I didn't learn  You didn't learn  Another thing I learned  I didn't know he had his own wrestling league  Yeah how did you not know that?  I didn't  Like I  Like when you were talking about Lou  I knew where he went but I had no idea that was  Billy Corgan's own 
[03:24:30]  Resistance Pro Wrestling is Billy Corgan's own wrestling group  Hired the great Lou E. Dangerous  His own wrestling promotion  Yes he did  Wow  Yeah Billy Corgan was great  What I learned today  Was that this show has a new catchphrase  Fucking lame bro  Yeah  Whenever anything goes wrong  Fucking lame bro  It always ends with bro  Like good luck bro  Yeah  It means I wish you'd die  Yeah  And now fucking lame bro is  Get your ass on the show  Kevin 
[03:25:00]  What did you learn on today's show?  Take your time  Same thing as  E-Rock  Like I thought  You gotta learn something else then  You guys remember Kevin of course  That's it  I don't want to learn something else  You don't  No it's already been done  What do you mean you don't want to  It's finished  What did you learn  Not what are you going  What did you  No no no  I mean like I don't want to learn something else other than him  Like I thought Billy Corgan was gonna be like some 
[03:25:30]  No I heard it when Eric said it  Okay well then  You heard it when he said then  What else did you learn on the show?  I don't really remember what else happened  Oh Jesus  Alright Kevin  Just pack up this shit then  I don't know what to tell you  How's the production piece coming?  It's pretty good  You gonna be ready for tomorrow?  Yeah  Sal?  Yes  How's it coming?  Well we worked on it on Monday  We're gonna  I think we're gonna finish it up today  And uh  It's gonna be interesting 
[03:26:00]  I think  It's gonna be uh  Unique  That doesn't sound promising  It's gonna be interesting  He doesn't sound confident at all  No he doesn't think it's good  Um  It's gonna be played  Probably  I can't guarantee that  Joe in Tennessee  What did you learn?  Hey Sammy  I learned that  Opie  Didn't have the shit  All he had was a simple  Summer flu  Who knew that  Norton was lying to us  The whole time  That Jim Norton  Did not have the inside track  And that Opie  Was not indeed  Shitting all over his testicles 
[03:26:30]  Violently  Violently  Sean in Alabama  You're on after Opie and Anthony live  Sam I just wanna say  Thank you for the Innkeepers DVD  A couple months ago  You got it  Uh but I did learn today  That uh  Opie only came into work today  To get Billy Corgan sick  Can you imagine now  If Billy Corgan  Gets sick after all this  Now  Thankfully  He's not going on tour right away  But  He's still gonna have to perform  He's doing a press tour  He's going to LA  I'm sure he's gonna have to be  Performing on TV shows 
[03:27:00]  And stuff  Can you imagine  If this  Show  Brings down  Billy Corgan  In the midst of his  Giant press tour  For this album  That apparently  You know  Like he said  He's been doing albums  For the last several years  It's not like he disappeared  But I guess this album  I haven't heard it yet  We heard the one song  That we played today  Is uh  Uh  Very much endeared  By Smashing Pumpkins fans  They feel like this is the old  Billy Corgan again  So everybody's very excited  About it  Can you imagine  If this show  Brings him down 
[03:27:30]  Through Opie's  Opie's flu germs  Uh  Mark in Queens  Yes  How you doing Sam  How you doing  Yeah  I learned a couple things  Really  Yes  One  From Warren Sapp  If you holler  At a girl in New York City  That's against the law  Now yeah  Warren Sapp said  Hollering  As you say Mark  At a girl in New York City  Is illegal  I don't know  If it's really illegal  Or if it's just illegal  According to Judge Sapp's rules  I'm not quite sure on that  But  Well I don't know 
[03:28:00]  But I still do it though  You know  And then second  Is that how Annie  Like to run down girls  And probably pass them  And turn around  And take a look at them again  That's right  That's right  I love your accent Mark  You're doing  You're doing good things  For this show  Yeah  Opie got a little creepy  I felt like  That was Opie who said that  Not Anthony  But Opie  Early on in the show  He said that he follows girls  When he sees attractive girls  And they're walking around  He follows them  To wherever they're going  And then  Not just follows them  And then sometimes  Runs ahead of them 
[03:28:30]  So he can look at them  Yeah several blocks  So he can wait again  That's weird  Do you do that Eric?  No  Sal?  Yes  You do?  No I don't  It's weird  It's very strange  Let's see  Bobby the Champ  Is on the phone  Former intern  For Opie and Anthony  Former intern  For the Ron and Fez show  And regular caller  After Opie and Anthony live  What's up Bobby the Champ?  PTSR  What's going on?  How are you?  Alright well  I have to talk to Travis  If he's available  In the studio  Travis 
[03:29:00]  I don't know where he's at  But he should be on his way down  Sorry that's bad radio  To call for someone  That I don't know  If's in the studio  No no no  It works  It works  This is the thing  I love the Smashing Pumpkins  I love the Billy Corgan interview  There was just one small thing  I take away  I took away from it  Yes I hope it's  I wrote this down  Bobby the Champ  I'm going to let you say it  But I hope it's the same thing  That I was thinking  What did you take away?  The fact that  Everybody in the industry  Always takes a shot  At Eddie Vedder and Pearl Jam  He doesn't like Eddie Vedder  He said  But you know who else said that? 
[03:29:30]  Tom Morello on Ron and Fez  Really?  He loved Soundgarden  And Chris Cornell  And then he's like  Pearl Jam came up  And he's like  I'm not a really big fan of theirs  And the same thing  In the Live Forever documentary  They were talking about  They were talking about  The Britpop  And how  When Oasis and Blur came out  They were trying to compete  With the grunge scene  And like Nirvana was the only good band  You know Pearl Jam wasn't good  Like I just don't understand  I'm a huge Pearl Jam fan  I also want  I just found out  That Roland told me  Billy Corgan has rehearsals  For the tour  Starting tonight 
[03:30:00]  I don't know what you're talking about  So if Opie gets him sick  Oh good  Fuck  No Bobby  Not good  Picked up on the same thing  That I picked up on  That I wrote down  I don't know if you heard this or not  You might have been in the hallway  But at the end of the interview  Billy Corgan said  He's not an Eddie Vedder fan  He doesn't like Eddie Vedder  Well  How does that make you feel?  Not good  Because you like  You like  Yeah but I mean look  If you know  Billy Corgan was on one side of the room  And Eddie Vedder was on the other side of the room  And they were both calling my name  I'd go to Eddie Vedder  Oh no 
[03:30:30]  With a big hug  So what did Bobby want to know?  How I felt about that?  Well no  I just feel like  I was just telling them that on Ron and Fez  Tom Morello said he wasn't a fan of Eddie Approach  Like I just don't  Why does everyone  I mean people are kind of diplomatic about it  But is he that  Is he that much of a shithead?  Oh I don't know  I've never heard that he's  That he's really a shithead  But I mean you know  He's one of those people that are  He's notoriously private  Like he doesn't give a lot of radio  Or any interviews  Press interviews  Yeah he doesn't do a lot of press 
[03:31:00]  I know he doesn't take pictures  With fans when they wait outside  Concerts  Because he would rather just  Shake their hands and talk to them  Hey Louis CK's them  Yeah yeah  But I don't think he does it to be a dick  I think he just does it because  He just wants to be a normal person  And talk to people  Well yeah that's what Louis said  Louis said when he was in here last time  That's the exact same thing  That he was like  I stopped  I've decided to not take pictures with people anymore  I don't do it  Because they come up  And they don't even want to talk to me  That's all they care about  Is getting a picture  Unless they're hot chicks  Yeah  They've been the rules  But then Louis said 
[03:31:30]  There was even one time  Where he had a conversation with a person  And then like after the conversation  Was over the person was like  So okay so now can we do the pic  And Louis was like  No we're not doing a picture  Like that's the one thing  I'm always afraid of  Is if Eddie Vedder ever comes up here  You know and it's ever a possibility  Like I know I'm not going to get a picture  He might do it for press though  Maybe  What come up here?  No like when he  He might take pictures  When it's associated with press  I would get a picture  And then show it to Travis  I didn't care  But I've never heard that  I've never heard that he's an asshole  And I've met  Who was up here 
[03:32:00]  Two weeks  Stone Gossard was up here  A couple weeks ago  Couldn't have been nicer  Right  One of the nicest guys  So how come guys like  Tom Morello and Billy Corgan  Don't like him  I don't know  Maybe they know something  We don't know  That's what makes it even worse  It's almost like  They're criticizing like  The music  The art  The work itself  Which is like  You know I'm a huge fan of  So it's  It's almost like  You know Morello was like  They don't rock as hard  As like a sound guard  And that was like  Basically his point  But I don't know  I just  They've been great for 20 years  Do you think Billy Corgan's got 
[03:32:30]  He's being pretty honest  About the fact that  He does have professional jealousy  And did when  When that era was happening  And that it exists  Maybe he's  I mean  Fucking Pearl Jam's playing  Two nights in Manchester  Right  Maybe it is like  The fact that  And he's playing Terminal 5  Yeah  So  He could be  Have some  Because he said  He respects the guy  And like he acknowledged him  As being a real musician  And a real dude  Yeah  But he doesn't like him  Maybe they know something  None of us do  I mean  Who knows  Maybe he is an asshole  Hey Travis  Stupid side note  There is a promo 
[03:33:00]  That they play  On Pearl Jam Radio  Like I don't know  If they still played  A while back  With Stone  He does the promo  And it sounds exactly like  You over the radio  I don't know  Or we're the same guy  Yeah that's right  Alright thank you Bobby the Champ  Bye Bobby  Bye  Does that upset you  When like  When one of your  People you're very excited  One of your  I don't want to call  Billy Corgan  One of your idols  But someone you're  A big fan of  Does not like somebody  That you're a big fan of  I couldn't care less  It always upsets me  Does it?  Yeah yeah yeah  Why?  What do you care?  Now we're not gonna hang out? 
[03:33:30]  If Rob Zombie was like  Yeah Jack White's a fucking asshole  I'd be like  No!  No!  No no no  I really don't care  All three of us  Are gonna hang out  No see that's not  What's gonna happen  Why?  Like for instance  Two years ago  There were pictures  Of Jay Z and Jack White  In the studio together  I remember those  The song never came out  For whatever reason  But just that they were  Hanging out together  In the studio  Was like  Yeah we can all be friends  Yes!  This is great!  Maybe Jay Z will come in  And then maybe Jack White  Will come in too  And now if Jay Z had been like  Yeah we recorded something  And as it turns out 
[03:34:00]  Jack White is a cocksucker  I'd be like  No no no no  Jay!  It can happen  No I could care less  What  Because you're also  A big Courtney Love fan  Yeah  Like that you care about  So who do you pick  In the big  Love  Love Corrigan split  I really don't care  You don't  I don't care  You just listen to the music  Yeah I just want to go  See them in concert  And take pictures with them  And I've done that  With both of them  I can't relate to that  Even though I do need  A new Courtney Love picture  Why? 
[03:34:30]  You've got like  Three  Yeah but the last one  Was like ten years ago  Was it with you and your cat  When you had long hair?  No  I guess  The first one I still had long hair  I think  I met her in 98  But you don't get obsessive  With these people?  No  Not anymore  No  When you were younger you did  Yeah  When I was younger  I cut school and waited  Outside Howard Stern's studio  To get a picture of Courtney Love  Did you get one?  Yeah  And it was worth it  Yeah it was great  But I would never do that today  I was thinking about it today  When like Billy Corgan  Was talking about how  You know he grew up 
[03:35:00]  Listening to Led Zeppelin  And so did everybody else  You know sort of  Sonic Youth and all that stuff  And like  And you know you always see  Like movies from the 70s  These kids are writing like  Zeppelin and stuff  On their notebooks and stuff  Like do you think he realizes  That like now  People like  People do that  I was drawing  I drew pictures of Billy Corgan  On my notebook in school  You drew actual pictures of him  Yes  That's weird  With his Zero shirt on  I would have done like  I wrote like Zero  And maybe like you know  No  I would  A heart logo  I would draw little doodles  Of Billy Corgan  In the Bullet 
[03:35:30]  With Butterfly Wings video  That's weird  That's what I would draw  I would draw pictures of  Billy Corgan  And the Blue Meanie  On my notebooks  Which I bet  And you know what  He would probably appreciate that  I'm sure he appreciates that  Just had a little  Whole Foods bag  Yeah I had Billy Corgan's  Whole Foods bag in my  Yeah Billy Corgan  See that's what I'm talking about Roland  Nobody listening to the show  Knows that Billy Corgan  Walked in with a Whole Foods bag  So people listening to you  Right now are like  Why would Roland suggest  That Sam adds a Whole Foods bag  To the logo  To the drawing 
[03:36:00]  That doesn't make any sense  Well it makes sense to me  Yes and that's all that counts  He just came in  And started passing out  Waters to everybody  That was hilarious  That was funny  Well he couldn't take him  On the plane  Some people  Mike in Houston  Wants to talk about Eddie Vedder  What's up Mike  Oh hey man  I don't want to talk about  Eddie Vedder  I was just going to add on  To what that caller was saying  About not liking Eddie Vedder  Yeah  I know Kurt Cobain  Didn't really care for him either  And there's a band  Called Vocal H  That has a song called  High Fiving Motherfucker  That was supposed to be  About Eddie Vedder  I think he's  Kind of been revered 
[03:36:30]  As sort of like  A hack  Or like a try hard  Or something like that  Alright well Mike  For somebody who didn't want  To talk about Eddie Vedder  You shared a lot of  Eddie Vedder stuff  To talk about  Did Kurt Cobain  Didn't like Eddie Vedder  Well they talked about this  In the Pearl Jam documentary  Yeah I didn't watch it  You should  It's really good  But it was  I mean from  From what Eddie says  You know it was more of  Like a media thing  You know like  Kurt versus Eddie  You know because  They were  And Tupac  Yeah they were the two  Biggest bands  Of that time  And you know 
[03:37:00]  Eddie says he didn't  Hate Kurt  But who knows  It's hard to say  You hate Kurt now  Isn't it  Yeah it's really hard  Then we would have  Confirmation that  Eddie Vedder is a dickhead  If he said  Yeah I mean  Yeah Kurt Cobain  Was a fucking asshole  There's footage from  You know  The night that they  Found out that Kurt died  You know  There's footage from  The concert of them  You know  Paying respect to  Kurt Cobain  I don't think any of them  Like really hated each other  But the fuck do I know  Billy Corgan doesn't like  Eddie Vedder  He doesn't  No  Billy Corgan's an  Opinionated guy though  He really is  He hates the music industry 
[03:37:30]  Maybe that's why  He hates Eddie Vedder  Because Eddie Vedder  Has just done so well  And I was bummed out  Because all in a  Really because it  Turned into such  A natural conversation  That we didn't hit  Anything that was  On the prep sheet  Was there  Whatsoever  Something in particular  That you were hoping  They'd talk about  Well I  When we were talking  About the music industry  I wanted them to ask him  About tweeting out  That he would piss on  Radiohead  Oh yeah  Did you see that tweet  Yeah I did  Billy Corgan tweeted out  I'll piss on radio  I'll piss on radiohead  And I was like  Now that's a statement  Because nobody ever  Says anything bad  About radiohead  No it's 
[03:38:00]  Actually it is  Starting to become  Cool to not like radiohead  Oh  I think right in the  Hipster community Sal  Is that right  Yes this is the latest  It's cool to not like radiohead  Yeah it's not cool  I mean they just  Killed that dude  That special effect  Radiohead killed a guy  Yeah they're killing  Guys in Toronto  They set up a stage  And they pulled out  Like a pin  And it killed a guy  And they murdered him  Drum tech come here  And they murdered the drum tech  Well yeah but Billy Corgan  And his band  Murdered the keyboardists  That's true  And the drummer almost died  Yeah they almost 
[03:38:30]  Murdered their drummer  So you know  Everybody murders  When they're on tour  It's grunge rock  That's what we do  But yeah I mean  Nobody does go out  And nobody of Billy Corgan's  You know stature  Comes out and says  I'm gonna piss on radiohead  I love that  Especially it's like  Cause radiohead  Like you said  Radiohead has  Over the years  Been more successful  Than Billy Corgan has  I would think  They're the biggest rock band  But he doesn't care  He's not like  No he doesn't give a fuck  He's a cranky old man  He's not like  I don't wanna piss anyone off  He's like  Yeah fuck radiohead  Fuck radiohead  What's radiohead doing 
[03:39:00]  For smashing pumpkins  It's kinda weird  I found this thing online  It says  Corgan has praised radiohead  If they're not the best band  In the world  Then they're one of the best  Yeah but he's probably  And then he was like  He probably  You know what Billy Corgan did  He got annoyed  That everybody is now  Praising radiohead  And that's like  The cool thing  Like he said  He was told  It's not cool  To like Black Sabbath  And all that  So now it's the cool thing  To like radiohead  So he's like  Fuck those guys  Troy did you hear  That he said  He would piss on radiohead  Yeah  What did you think of that  Well I mean  He seemed disappointed 
[03:39:30]  No radiohead's good  I mean I'll always like radiohead  I just kinda feel like  They're just getting  You ever hear  Getting weird  I totally agree  Have you guys heard Creep  What's that song  It's really good  They're hit single  They're new hit single  Yeah you should check it out  I remember reading an interview  With somebody in the band  And they were working on a new album  And they were coming up with these songs  And they would bring them to Tom  And Tom would say  That sounds great  But it sounds like radiohead  Yeah  And so like  If that's the way you're gonna  You're gonna write music  Like I think that kinda sucks  You know  Radiohead strikes me as kinda  And I don't know much about radiohead 
[03:40:00]  But what they strike me as  Is kind of like  Well we're universally recognized  As being the greatest ever  So we're specifically  Gonna go out of our way  To do stuff that is  Weird  Just far out  Yeah  And maybe even  Specifically not good  In a way I kinda respect that  Cause you know  A band like the Beatles  I mean every album they put out  Sounded completely different  Than the last  Always comes back to the Beatles  Well cause I mean  Well really I mean in reality  They laid the blueprint for everything  I thought Jay Z did the blueprint  Well he did the blueprint later  Oh okay  But they laid the blueprint for rock and roll 
[03:40:30]  In my opinion  So Radiohead does the same thing  They wanna switch it up  Every album and do it  But then they just get so weird  Where it's just not even  It's just  It's just so far out there  And they  They feel like they're Radiohead  They can do whatever they want  Exactly  People are just gonna praise it  You know what I mean  That's where I have the problem  Is the people praising it  Except Billy Corgan won't  No no  He'll piss on them  He keeps it real  I don't have a problem  With a band doing whatever they want  Like Radiohead  Has earned the right to do  To make whatever music they want  Sure  But every time a new album comes out  Everybody's like 
[03:41:00]  Oh my god  It's the best album ever  And it's not  And do they not  It's a good album  It's a good record  They haven't put out a bad record  Right  But you're not making  Okay Computer again  Right  You know  And they don't do the hits  In concert  Very rarely  They haven't played Creep in years  That's the song though  Yeah but that song sucks  They'll play like Paranoid Android  It's not boring  Sam their other shit  That they play live  Sam just go away  Don't say the Creep sucks  Now you're being the hipster douche guy  Who says the song Creep sucks  Just go home  It's just a fucking boring song  Just take a hike 
[03:41:30]  It's a great song  It's a boring  Take a hike Sal  Even Tom York said himself  It's a song that is just so overplayed  And it's boring to him  Because that's the fucking douchey cool guy  I'm a rock star thing to say  That's the cool thing  They have much more interesting music to play live  Just quiet down  Thank you Tom York Jr  Yeah  You guys don't get it but  Shut up  I went to one of those Roseland shows  That they did  I'll piss on South  And they're far more a dance band now  Than they are a rock band  Really?  Radio haters?  Yeah I mean like  They played maybe one song  From their first four albums 
[03:42:00]  They were probably all better than Creep right?  Sam get the fuck out of here  I would leave disappointed  You know it's kind of like  You just have to accept  That you're seeing a different band now  Yeah  You know like you're really  You're not going to see anything off Pablo Honey  You're not going to see anything off the Benz  And Tom York himself has even said  Pablo Honey is one of the worst albums ever  Created  Alright well it made him what he is  Rivers Cuomo said  Pinkerton was one of the worst albums ever  And that album is fucking brilliant  Tom York says that to be cool  No he doesn't  It's a shit album 
[03:42:30]  Just shut up  You'll hear like two songs off OK Computer  And then you know  Kid A and Hail to the Thief  And all that stuff  What did you  Your music guy  Why do you think  Billy Corgan  Is not a fan of Eddie Vedder?  I don't know man  It's hard to say  Eddie Vedder kind of comes across  A little pompous  A little bit of a dick  I think  But I don't know  Remember when Jimmy Fallon was in here  He said Eddie Vedder was one of the  You know McCartney types  Who at first was a big no on doing any bits  Now McCartney has kind of earned that 
[03:43:00]  But Eddie Vedder I don't think  I mean he's done a lot  But he's not Paul McCartney  Right  And he did first say no to doing the bit  I mean but then he did it  So it's like  McCartney did that too  Right so how do she  I don't know man  I mean I guess out of all those bands  People just want to be people maybe  They don't want to perform  Yeah they don't want to be a puppet  You just get beaten down too  I mean you know how much bullshit  Has Eddie Vedder gone through  You know what I mean  Where he just has to deal with assholes  So you just  You get to the point where you're just like  Yeah we really don't know what it's like  Like Eddie Vedder is prepared for Jimmy Fallon 
[03:43:30]  To be another schlocky radio guy  Who's got a dumb idea  When he's just trying to promote his album  And then he sees it and goes  Okay Jimmy Fallon's a good guy  I really thought Billy Corgan  Would sort of be along the same  In the same world  You know what I mean  I just I couldn't believe how fucking cool he was  Like my respect for Billy Corgan  After today hearing him on the show  Just went through the roof  Well because you heard  That happens a lot around here  Yeah  Like when Jeff Goldblum came in  Like there's always  I've always heard stories of  Oh he's this weird asshole  Like he's not going to be cool and everything  And it's probably my 
[03:44:00]  My favorite interview of the year so far  He's nuts  And he's  Oh yeah  Yeah everybody who said he's insane  Is absolutely correct  But he's not an asshole  But he's the nicest guy  He was great  Yeah  Absolutely  You know what I would have loved too  I would have loved if Billy Corgan  Just stayed and hung out  And they just didn't talk  You know  Where he just hangs and just  You know  Talks about anything  Well that's the thing  I felt like he really could have  And that's why  If he didn't have a flight  I bet he would have  Yeah  He was so different  That he was  Comfortable in here  He wasn't trying to be anything  But he was just comfortable 
[03:44:30]  Presenting his opinions  And what they were  He was  He knew  He knows who he is  He knows what he thinks  And he's completely unafraid  To be that  Yeah  You know what I mean  And he's  I mean his music catalog is amazing  Because like  We got an email yesterday  That he was coming in today  And I was like  Okay  And I was talking to my girlfriend  And my girlfriend's like  Ugh  It's like smashing pumpkins  Yuck  And I'm like  Are you fucking kidding me  And I just started playing videos  And I'm just like  Holy shit  You forget  Like today  The song today  That video  And the song  Is like  One of the best songs  Out of the 90s  It is 
[03:45:00]  One of the  Sort of  Era and genre  Defining songs  Of that time  By the way  A little text update  Anthony  Is  Calling  Sal a hipster asshole  Yeah I think  Sal should definitely  Get the new title  Because Anthony  We can build shows  I mean I  Went to a school  That it was  You know  I was surrounded  By those fucking assholes  All day long  Sal also at the same time  Doesn't like the Beatles  And in that  That in my opinion  Makes you a fucking asshole  If you specifically say  I really don't like talking to people 
[03:45:30]  That say that  Yeah me neither  It's like  I don't like chocolate  It's like  Then you're a fucking asshole  Eric doesn't like chocolate  He's a fucking asshole  For a whole different  Yeah Anthony wrote a  Fuck radiohead  Play creep  Assholes  And then  Hipster asshole  Sal  You are a hipster asshole  That's fine  And you are one  By the way  The people that you went to school with  Is you  You are one of them  Oh yeah yeah  To a different degree  Can I just say one thing though  I completely agree with what you're saying  About Billy Corgan and stuff  Because I actually used to work for  An ice cream truck  An ice cream truck 
[03:46:00]  We watch the today  Video all the time  I used to work for  I'm not going to say who  But one of  Another member  Ex-member of the  Smashing Pumpkins  James Ehan  Exactly done  And  And I was taught  Pretty much while I was there  Is like  You know  Billy Corgan is the fucking  Antichrist  It was James Ehan then  No no no  James Ehan never specifically  Never  So it's funny because  They all hate him  No no  But that's the thing  Like I got the impression  That Billy Corgan  Jimmy Chamberlain  Didn't hate him  Jimmy Chamberlain  Was just fucked up  Right  He recorded  He recorded like that 
[03:46:30]  Yeah I think he had  Misdirected anger  So anyway  And when I got  When I got to hear him  On the interview today  Like yeah absolutely  Like I saw a much more  Genuine side of him  I got to hear a flip side  So who did you work with  I'm not going to say it  Because you know  Well there's not that many  Members of the Pumpkins  I don't think it was  Jimmy Chamberlain  Because he was part of  The Smashing Pumpkins  Oh it might have been  No Sal plays drums  I do play drums  And Jimmy Chamberlain  Was with them  Up until  Two albums ago  Right  So I don't want to say  Who but  But Jimmy Chamberlain 
[03:47:00]  Is a really good guess  Jimmy Chamberlain  No Billy Corgan  Was a really good guess  Guess  Guess  Oh good guess  Yeah yeah yeah  Get the hipster asshole  Gunk out of your ears  Chamberlain actually played  On  Zeitgeist  And  Probably Zeitgeist  Zeitgeist  Probably  But this album  Got shit reviews  Listen  It was pretty shitty  There's only three  Possible people correct  Right  So  Okay okay  Tell me this  I'll give you another hint  I'm a New York based person  I don't know anything about that  I don't know which one of them  I'll give you another hint  Just fucking tell Sam  I know Billy Corgan 
[03:47:30]  Is from Chicago  I don't know  But  Male or female  Male  Doom  Darcy is out of the box  Darcy is  Darcy she fell off  The face of the earth  She like  She went into like  Reclusion  It's definitely James  Right Travis  It's absolutely  James Eehaw  Because he hated Billy Corgan  Yeah  Well Billy I think  Blames James  For the reason that they broke up  And James probably blames Billy  I don't know  I couldn't tell you  Did you ask him?  I never asked James that specifically  When you talked to him?  I did speak to him  Okay 
[03:48:00]  At some point in my life  That was even quicker  Than I got Eric to admit  That he had intercourse  On my wedding night  Both of which  Like who gives a fuck  Right  Just say it  Just say it  When were you hanging out  With James Eehaw?  Well I used to intern  At their recording studio  They have in Manhattan  He has  Who's they?  Someone in the  Smashing Pumpkins  It was James  James is a co-owner  Of a studio  Oh okay  Okay  So you're just  Holds under questioning  You're just an intern  Yeah  And James Eehaw 
[03:48:30]  Hates this guy so much  That he's like  Hey interns  Let me tell you something  That's why  Avoid Billy Corgan  Gather around interns  No no  That's why I didn't want to say it  Because James never spoke to me  Like that at all  So how'd you find that out?  Just the overall vibe  Of co-owners  Associates of the studio  Producers  Staff  You don't want to bring up  That guy right  James  Pretty much  Like it was kind of said  Like you don't bring  Don't bring that up at all  You know even though  There was like  Smashing Pumpkins  Like one of a kind  Memorabilia everywhere  That's crazy though  Why can't he just be like 
[03:49:00]  You know what  It's been a few years  It's been a while  It's been like  Ten years plus probably  Yeah  We were an iconic band  Let me put the bullshit aside  And just appreciate  What happened  So many bands do that though  So many bands say  I'd never talk to that guy  Ever again  Dude  They can never  People can never let it go  Yeah  Especially in bands  I don't know what it is  Smiths  Smiths  They're fucking  They hate each other  Pink Floyd  Look at  Yeah you're right  Pink Floyd  They hate each other  Look at  What's his name  Like I could see  Not touring together  But to the point 
[03:49:30]  Where it's like  It's still a point of contention  Like come on dude  Yeah  You know  Like  And if  If your band  If you never did anything  With your band  That's fine  But when it's a Pink Floyd  When it's the Smashing Pumpkins  When it's someone like that  Like let it go  And just be cool  Egos man  They can't do it  They can't do it  Do you think that's what it is  Guns and Roses  Yeah  And that's Axl  Or is it Axl and Slash  I think it's mostly Axl  Well you think about  In that world 
[03:50:00]  I mean  Axl wrote the lyrics to it  Those riffs  Those are all Slash  So it's like  Who's responsible for  Sweet Child of Mine  Well Axl had the lyrics  But Slash came up  With that iconic riff  So  Based on  We've had a lot of  Guns and Roses members  In the studio  And it seems like  It's a Slash and Axl thing  Because Duff  Was totally cool  With a reunion  He said  Izzy was cool  Izzy was  And Stephen Adler  He was cool  I don't think they'd ever  He's just not that good 
[03:50:30]  Of a drummer anymore  So I don't think  They would ever have him do it  They would have to do  Matt Sorum  But it seems like  It's Slash Axl  Well I mean look at  You know everybody  When you think of Guns and Roses  You think of those too  Yeah  I mean Slash just had such a look  And the riffs  You know so  But yeah I mean I just  I don't know  Did the Beatles  When they broke up  They didn't hate each other  They hated each other  Yeah  Really  Well because John had left the band  And just said look  Let's just  Let's just  Let's just say we're on hiatus  And then Paul went out to the press  And said I quit the Beatles 
[03:51:00]  And he's  And everybody's like  You fucking asshole  You're a Paul McCartney fan  That's an asshole move  It's a big dick move  But you know at that time  You know  They were pissed at John  For bringing Yoko in  And he was off doing crazy shit  And you know  And then it turned out  And then they started writing  Mean shit about each other  In songs  In solo songs  At the very  At the end of John's life though  Did he still hate Paul  No they actually became friends  That's what I'm talking about  But they were actually talking about  In the 80s  Coming back together  To do something  Whether you can reunite the band or not 
[03:51:30]  Is that's a totally different thing  But the fact that  You can't be cool  It's like  Yeah Bruce broke up  For 10 years  And he came back  Right  Like that's  Like yeah  Anyone in the E Street band  It's one thing  While you're performing  Because creatively  When you're performing  You end up breaking up  I can understand that  But if anybody in the E Street band  Like harbored real resentment  Towards Bruce  For like years and years and years  At some point  You just have to get over it  It's just egos  And especially with Lennon and McCartney  I mean they were  They were a yin and a yang  So they were just  They're like  Well the reason why the Beatles 
[03:52:00]  Are amazing is because  John said it's because of me  I'm the soul of the band  And Lennon and McCartney  It's a lot harder to figure out  But McCartney was a better songwriter  Than John  In my opinion  But I know  But even that's up for debate  Yeah  Exactly  Sal is James Ehead  Was he a dick  No he was like  One of the nicest dudes  I've ever met in the music industry  And Billy Corgan was cool  Billy Corgan was awesome  You know  So it's very strange  When just personalities  It's a lot  It's a lot of money  And what Troy was saying  About who wrote what  All that stuff is actually  Predetermined  That's how they 
[03:52:30]  Collect royalties and stuff  So if someone  Is going to go on tour  You know  Making money  Usually not everybody's  Making the same amount of money  And that's a whole other issue  And like oh well  If you want me to come back  I'm not going to be making  As much money  So fuck you  Billy Corgan was  The singer-songwriter  And the front man  So it's kind of hard to argue  Who was the most important member  But when you start a band out  With these people  They all sort of think  Well we were there with you  In the beginning  Yeah you may be writing  More of the song  But we're there  We got your back  We're showing up on stage  To perform every day  And then I'm sure  An album like this 
[03:53:00]  Where Billy's getting praised for  And these other people  Aren't involved  He's like see  I was the one that actually  Wrote the good songs  Look at these songs  So now  E-ha  Sal's buddy  Is going to get all pissed  Because he's still  He's going out  As the Smashing Pumpkins  He's going to get all butthurt  And do pretty well  Yeah he's going to be all butthurt  Look at Billy Corgan  His car forgot to pick him up  This morning  So he went  Eh  I just get a cab  Walked over a few blocks  I said that sucks  He said eh  What are you going to do  Shit happens every day  To be a cab driver  And Billy Corgan gets in your cab  Although most of the cab drivers  Let's be honest  They probably don't know 
[03:53:30]  Who Billy Corgan is  I mean because most people  Get ruffled  He goes eh  Shit happens  You just got to go with it  So  You're going to happen  Because he said chit  Shit happens  That's what the cab driver said  But if  If Smashing Pumpkins  Got back together  You'd be pissed  If they started performing  Like today  No  You think they have  Much more interesting songs  No no no  I think overall  The Smashing Pumpkins  Have a really good  Fucking catalog  Like I love all their hits  Actually  Yeah  Well good for you Sal  You weren't even alive  When some of them came out 
[03:54:00]  Goddammit  They were  Yeah  It was two  It was two  Yeah  I think  I think  He was like  He was literally two  When Gish came out  I think  Actually  I think you were one  When Gish came out  Oh  You did your research  I guess  Well it came out in like  891  I'm going to try  You were born in 90  Right  Yep  91  That's when Gish came  What time was you  91  91  It might have been  Six months  Yeah  You might not have  Even been one  I was actually  Yeah I was  Your mom was  Still wiping your ass 
[03:54:30]  Your mom wasn't  Your mom was probably  Wiping your ass  When Siamese Dream  Came out too  Now there was a story  You wanted to talk to me  About  Roland and you  Going on a bike ride  Yeah  Tell me about that  Roland you're not  An exercise fanatic  Well give that away  Well I mean  I'm trying to encourage  Roland to  First of all  What Roland needs to do  In my opinion  Is to  To eat a little bit better  Oh yeah by the way  I got a very angry tweet  For somebody  This morning  Who was listening 
[03:55:00]  To yesterday's after show  Who said  You fucking assholes  He was talking  You remember yesterday  We were talking about  Shit problems  And basically  Troy and I  Were in agreement  Agreement  That  Roland  Having to shit  All the time  As well as  Eric having to shit  In places such as  Behind a Bank of America  And on the side  Of the Long Island Expressway  Is because  They do horrible things  To their body  They don't eat right  Blah blah blah  Somebody tweeted  Tweeted me saying 
[03:55:30]  You guys are fucking idiots  It's not all about diet  Haven't you ever heard  Of IBS  Right  So that does pose  A question  Roland  For the record  Do you have  Irritable bowel syndrome  I have LBS  Little blood sugar  Little blood  But not irritable bowels  I could have that  I don't know  Undiagnosed  I'm not a doctor  I can't diagnose myself  Eric  Do you have  Irritable bowel syndrome  I have never been  Diagnosed with anything  Well  When I shit  People go  What the fuck  Happens  No you have  Irritating bowel syndrome  That's a whole different thing  Everybody gets irritated 
[03:56:00]  Alright so  Now that that's out of the way  Yeah so  We went out  We were hanging out  We went to brunch  On Saturday  Brunch  Yeah  How New York of you  Right  Yeah we went to a cool spot  On the Upper East Side  And it was Roland  My girlfriend and I  And my girlfriend and I  Were going to go out  For a bike ride  And we're like  What are you doing dude  And he's like  Oh nothing really  I'm like  Let's go on a bike ride  What did you have for brunch  Salmon Benedict  Okay  I had steak and eggs  Good for you  That's my brunch  Good for you  But so we're like 
[03:56:30]  Yeah let's go for a bike ride  So we went and rented a bike  And you know  Roland just needs to  Figure out what he can do  For exercise that's fun  Okay  Because you know  Going to the gym  And just standing on  Running on a treadmill  That gets boring  You can  So but you can  You can have fun on a bike  You know you can go  Out on trails  Or you can go  You know  You can have your cake  And eat it too  Yeah  Not literally Roland  Especially there's so much  To see in New York City  So you can  You're visually stimulated  While you're riding your bike  You know  And there's girls everywhere  And if there is  Better motive  There's no better motivation 
[03:57:00]  Than that  Bitches  Yeah  So and  And Roland  Roland fucking killed it man  He went  He went balls to the walls  He went hard in the paint  Yeah he went crazy  And he's screaming  And he's yelling  Why are you screaming  He's just having a good time  And he's  And then  This is the funniest part  So he rented a bike  That had multiple speeds  Sure  I didn't know what to do  So he thought it was like a car  Where you have to start in first  Yeah  Go in second  So he ended up breaking the bike  Yeah  It's a rental 
[03:57:30]  You broke  So what happened when you returned it  I was like  Here you go  Oh thank you  And they gave him my receipt  I'm like  The bike's over there  And they just left  So they didn't find out  That all the gears had been broken  Because it was like  Near the end  When I shift it  And it just like froze  I'm like fuck  And you could hear him  Switching through gears  And you could just hear stuff  Grinding  I mean you just turn him back  And look at him  Like what the fuck  You're doing buddy  And he's laughing  He doesn't give a shit  He's having a good time  Oh yeah  How far did you bike?  Five miles  Five miles 
[03:58:00]  I feel like five miles  Yeah  Yeah it's about a quarter mile  We went from like 72nd Street  On the west side highway  Sure  All the way down to like 14th and back  So that's maybe  Maybe a mile and a half  Two miles  That's pretty good  Yeah  That's pretty good  Eric does this motivate you  To get behind the wheel of a bicycle?  Not at all  Get behind the wheel  I guess you're behind a wheel  Yeah  It doesn't sound appealing  Bike riding?  It's fine  It does  I just  I don't know  I haven't done it in so long  Yeah  Last time I was 12  It only took like five minutes  And I got it  Eric what if we started for you  With a big wheel? 
[03:58:30]  Oh they make adult sized big wheels  Of course you would know that  They do  They make it in the Dukes of Hazzard  They make it in the Dukes of Hazzard  Oh you mean you saw it in the movie?  No no no  Oh sorry  The color scheme  Oh  So you can get the Dukes of Hazzard big wheel  I had a Dukes of Hazzard regular  That's what I had  When you were trying  Oh yeah  I had that and chips  What's that?  I had another one too  I had another two  I forget what it was  So what would you get faster?  A big  An adult big wheel  Or a bicycle? 
[03:59:00]  That's a tough  No probably the big wheel  Probably right?  Why not?  Have a little fun  It's fun though  Because I just  Get one right around the halls  I didn't have a bell  You would ride around the halls  In the big wheel air?  Totally  How did you  What was the feedback like  On your shit stories yesterday?  Surprisingly  I got a few girls  Twittering saying that  Girls have horrible shit stories too  I don't want to hear about them  And what about your wife?  Did your wife say anything  About the fact that you said  On the air  To the audience  I am sure  You said that you are sure  I'm not going to say it  In the first person  And have you isolate that 
[03:59:30]  You said that you are sure  That your wife has shit herself before  No she hasn't said anything  Did she hear you say that?  Probably not  But she's listening now  Because she says  I want to get bikes  Okay well  Guess what Eric's wife  Yesterday he said  That he was sure  You've shit yourself before  At some point yes  Because he goes  Did your wife shit yourself?  Yeah I'm sure  It happens to the best of us  I said  Has your wife shit herself before?  And Eric said  I mean I'm sure she has  Which left a lot of us dumbfounded 
[04:00:00]  Like I'm sure that  My wife hasn't  That's something that  You're probably just in denial  You know what else is funny about this?  You just totally blew over this  She texted and was like  Hey let's go get bikes  Yeah  Like she's like  Eric please  Like let's fucking lose weight  And get in shape  It's fun though  We had a blast  This is the woman  I'll go this weekend too  This is the woman  Who got him a gym membership  Right  This is the woman  Personal trainer  Who got him a personal trainer  This is the woman  Who put him on the South Beach diet 
[04:00:30]  This is a desperate woman Troy  Like she's like  Please  Please  Let fucking  Lose some weight  And what does Eric do in return?  I'd want to watch the Simpsons  Eric goes in return  He goes to  He doesn't do any of the training  And he goes to her family barbecues  And watches professional wrestling on his phone  While the rest of her family commiserates  Oh my god  Can you imagine?  I feel so bad for her  And  She has to put up with him  Going on national radio  And announcing to the world  That she has a shitting problem  Well I got a text back on that  What did she say? 
[04:01:00]  It's all in capitals  And multiple exclamation points  Well you said she has a shit problem  What did she say?  I never said that  That was Sam  She said no, never  See?  I  Based on me getting to know her  I would assume  That she as a lady  Has not shit herself  We talked to Ron and Fez's female intern  She had not shit herself  You  After hearing from that intern  Immediately  Said I am sure  You said you are sure  That your wife has done this  Twice  I assume she had at one point 
[04:01:30]  You know  Happens to everybody  Do you believe her?  I believe her  Yes  I believe she hasn't  I also don't think girls are so quick  To admit that they shit themselves  Do you think Eric's gonna ride a bike  This weekend?  No, no, no  Eric's not one  You know what?  There's a greater chance of Eric's wife  Shitting herself this weekend  Than there is of Eric riding a bike  This weekend  Yeah, and we have  You know  Justin Stangle  From the Letterman Show  We brought him up on this show before  He's an avid after show listener  He just texted in saying  Eric's wife just found out  He said she shit herself  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 
[04:02:00]  So everybody's having a good laugh  Eric  He knows who I am  That's right  And now he knows who your wife is  And that she can control her bowels  Unlike her husband  Eric, what would happen if your wife said to you  I'm leaving you unless you lose weight?  What would you do?  Well then that would be an issue, wouldn't it?  What's that?  That would be an issue, wouldn't it?  Is that one of those  We'll get to those bridges  We'll cross that bridge when we get to it?  Yeah, that's a serious discussion  That would have to be had  Let's see  You'd have to really weigh your options  Yeah  It was fun, right?  I get it  She's not knocked up yet, right? 
[04:02:30]  That we know of  Right  So, there's no kid  Maybe it's worth leaving her  If you don't have to ride a bicycle, right?  And imagine if she gets pregnant  Because you know the husband always puts on sympathy weight  Oh yeah  Eric, are you worried about that?  Yeah, I've been projecting what  You know, what the weight's going to be for years now  You have sympathy weight putting on  Because you'd like to one day have a child  Yeah, I'm fat Nostradamus  Nostradamus  Well, you're a good person to do that for your wife  I predict that one day  Pre-sympathy  Yeah  And instead  Well, I'd like to first of all say this 
[04:03:00]  To Eric's wife  I would like to apologize on behalf of your husband  Who announced to the world yesterday  That he knows for a fact  That you have  I never said that  Yeah, that's not cool he did that  I never said that  You said  You said  I never said I knew for a fact  That's what sure means  I said  No, that's your interpretation of it  I said I'm sure she has  Okay, okay, okay  That doesn't mean it's a fact  Well, sure  I mean  I don't want to get dictionary.com 
[04:03:30]  No, because if I knew that for a fact  I would have said  I know she has  See the difference?  No, it's the same  I'm sure she has  Generally means  Well, I mean  I'm not the one who has an angry wife to talk to  I think you're the one who has to go  I think she should make him bike ride this weekend  That's a punishment  Well, she's not  She doesn't have that kind of ability  If she could make him bike ride  He would have been on a bike by now  Now  If she could make him do a lot of things  She would have done  We have gardening this weekend  Oh, wow  You and your light there  I know  Alright, gotta go 
[04:04:00]  Why don't you garden some vegetables?  No  No, that's boring  Wait, peace if you're out of dirt?  Eric is  Eric is  Eric is  Digging  Digging holes  And putting milk duds in them  Hoping to grow  Candy trees  We have to go  Ron and Fez are coming up next  Eric, I'm glad we could sort that out with your wife  We'll be back with more of this tomorrow  Goodbye, everybody  The Opie and Anthony show is now over  For real this time  Check out the O&A show on Facebook  At facebook.com  Slash Opie and Anthony
