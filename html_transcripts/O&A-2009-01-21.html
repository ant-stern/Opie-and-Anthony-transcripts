<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with reactions to Barack Obama's presidential inauguration.  The hosts speculated about Obama's demeanor (whether he was drinking champagne), the overwhelmingly positive media coverage (mentioning Anderson Cooper's enthusiasm), and Dick Cheney's wheelchair appearance.  Caller commentary included financial market updates post-inauguration and analysis of the fumbled oath of office between Obama and Chief Justice Roberts, with audio comparisons to George H.W. Bush's inauguration.  Ted Kennedy's reported seizure at the luncheon sparked humorous theories from callers. A caller's concern about Anthony's comments regarding African Americans needing to "get their house in order" led to a debate about race relations, crime statistics, and media representation.  The inauguration's celebrity reactions (Oprah and Tom Brokaw) and Elizabeth Alexander's closing poem (which the hosts disliked) were also discussed. Robert Kelly filled in for Jim Norton, and the hosts bantered about weight loss and social media usage.

The show continued with a critical discussion of the inauguration poem, focusing on its lack of rhyme and perceived nonsensical message, particularly lines referencing racial groups.  The hosts played humorous audio snippets from the inauguration, including comments from Obama, Ted Kennedy (during his apparent medical episode), Bill Clinton, and John McCain.  This transitioned into a detailed and sexually explicit discussion of conjoined twins, focusing on their physical characteristics, sex lives, and romantic relationships, filled with crude and offensive jokes about race, sex, and physical appearance. Robert Kelly contributed sporadically.

A caller, Susan, who grew up with conjoined twins, added to the discussion before abruptly hanging up after the hosts' darkly humorous comments.  The hosts then analyzed a video of conjoined twins playing basketball and discussed the societal fascination with "freak shows" and "disasters." The hosts also talked about their experiences with Twitter and Facebook, with Opie focusing on Twitter and Anthony on Facebook, including a picture of Anthony in a CBS studio.  The conversation shifted to Dane Cook's past misfortunes, Brother Elmo's insulin shock episode on a plane, and a Wisconsin mayor's resignation due to felony charges involving attempted meeting with a minor for sex and possession of child pornography.  The hosts then extensively discussed Vince McMahon's supposedly accidental injury from a falling stage prop, questioning its legitimacy given his swift return to work and a subsequent assault by Randy Orton, also resulting in injury.  The lack of media coverage was also noted, followed by a brief mention of an upcoming MMA event featuring Tito Ortiz and Fedor Emelianenko.

A segment heavily featuring Vince McMahon's injury (with speculation on its legitimacy), and a lengthy, explicit discussion about the “Am I Gay?” website ensued, fueled by listener calls and anonymous questions, with the hosts, Robert Kelly, and Danny (guests) engaging in outrageous sexually explicit jokes. Video gamers were also present in the studio.  A Sirius XM emergency alert system test briefly interrupted.  The segment concluded with a Porn.com advertisement, and further sexually explicit jokes about pornography consumption and masturbation.

The show proceeded to a discussion about the time it would take to watch all content on Porn.com, categorized by sexual preference and combinations thereof, using highly offensive and explicit language.  This transitioned to a discussion of the racial demographics of pornography on Porn.com. A joke about the Obamas having sex in the White House was made, followed by another Porn.com advertisement.  A *Back to the Future* plot analysis about Biff's condition after time travel led to more sexually explicit jokes involving time travel and sexual acts.  A call from comedian Bobby Kelly discussed his upcoming Chicago shows.  A lengthy discussion about the TV show *Lost*, its merits, and fan theories followed, interspersed with jokes and offensive language.  The show concluded with problem-solving one of the co-hosts’ internet connectivity issues (a faulty router), punctuated by vulgar jokes and sexually explicit language, before the hosts said goodbye.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Obama President, nah!  Obama President, nah!  Obama President, nah!  Obama President, nah!  Obama President, nah! 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, I remember saying that.  You sure did, Anthony.  That's because someone said that to me.  Now I have a new saying.  Uh-oh, what's your new saying?  Now let's change America!  Now let's change America!  Boy, did his dialect change from the beginning of the night to the end.  All I was thinking when I was watching the inauguration speech, wow, when is Stone Cold Steve  Austin coming out?  Yeah.  Because man, if he doesn't sound like The Rock when he's talking in front of a, whatever 
[00:01:00]  it was, a million and a half people.  Yeah.  He sounded more like The Rock last night than I've ever heard before.  And then as the night went on, all the festivities, I, uh, in my personal observation, I believe  he was drinking.  Really?  He looked a little more loose and a little, um, like, yeah, hey, let's change America!  Uh-huh. 
[00:01:30]  Maybe a little, uh, champagne?  I'm talking about, yeah, I'm sure him and, uh, the wife shared a little champagne.  Uh-huh.  Maybe, uh, you know, a little shats.  That's a long day, though.  Yeah, it is.  I mean, I certainly am not going to compare what I went through with, uh, with a president  being sworn in, but, like, recently when I got married, the festivities, by the end  of the day, you're just like, you can't focus, you're exhausted, your feet hurt, you're just  like, oh my God, I just want to crash.  Yeah.  And he was, like, doing that all effing day. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, apparently, though, he likes going out and hanging at night and doing stuff like  that.  Yeah.  So, uh, that's another thing we'll see, a whole new aspect of the presidency, one that  actually, like, I think goes out, leaves the White House.  Well, I don't know, they were saying that this is going to be a huge adjustment for the  guy, because he really does like to be out and about and go, hey, I'm going to go down  to the, uh, local, uh, high school and play a little, uh, basketball.  Okay, let's cordon that off with a few tanks.  Right.  And, uh, we'll get some Blackhawks up above. 
[00:02:30]  Right.  And, uh, then feel free to just jog around, you know.  Uh, but.  We'll shoot anyone we see.  And, um, all right, have fun.  They said it's going to be really tough for this guy to adjust, because what do they call  it when, uh, after today, you go into the White House, but they call it something like  the glass box, the, uh.  Okay, I thought you were going to.  But he's.  I thought you were going to say what I was reading all night.  He's the type of guy, he was, he's pretty much one of the most famous people in the world,  and he would just go to his wife, because he wasn't the president yet.  Hey, I'm going to go to the school and pick up the girls today. 
[00:03:00]  And he would just hop in his, uh, his, uh, ride.  He was in a gilded cage, a glass menagerie.  Something like that, right?  Yeah, he kind of, um.  And he was actually still driving himself a mere week or two ago.  Not no more.  Now it's driving Mr. Obama.  Like Anthony said, I mean, we're fortunate here in New York City.  Actually, we shouldn't call it fortunate.  But when Bush came to town, it was a complete nightmare.  Yeah.  You couldn't move in this city.  And I don't think he realizes that he can't just go off and play basketball without, like 
[00:03:30]  Ann said, you know, you know, first of all, they're going to choose who he plays basketball  with now.  I'm just going to go off and shoot some hoops.  Okay, we're going to shoot everyone we see coming near you.  Right.  We have to do a security check on everyone, and then we'll decide, according to their  background, who you're allowed to play basketball with.  So I guess then you should schedule hoops for about a month.  Right, exactly.  Thank you.  And they said, uh, it was just, I don't know, it was really good TV.  I watched everything since.  I did too.  From 11 o'clock when we got off the air until 9 o'clock, I was glued in front of that TV. 
[00:04:00]  And, uh, some fine watching, man, just very, very interesting.  Like, when he walked Pennsylvania Avenue, they said that'll be the last time he does  that, and whether it's four or eight years, he will, you will never see him walk that  road.  Really?  Yeah.  Why is that?  Why were they speculating that he wouldn't do it in, like, no other president, uh, no,  I mean, between now and when he leaves office, there's not a chance that he'll just walk  Pennsylvania Avenue.  Oh, right, right.  True. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  So that's a little weird.  Like, he's going to be the boy in a bubble or something.  Yeah.  Boy in the plastic bubble.  Where do we begin?  I guess we'd give out the phone number, 877-212-0&A.  I mean, the phones are ringing.  It's definitely an audience participation show today.  Lots of phone calls.  Oh, yeah.  It was huge.  Like you said, uh, the coverage last night, watched it.  Um, wow.  They really, I know it's Obama's day and everything, and, uh, they could not find one bad thing to 
[00:05:00]  say.  Right.  Not about him.  I mean, what are they going to do?  Trash him on his inauguration day?  But, like, everyone around him, everyone he knows, the people that think everyone, all  they were saying is, this is just a wonderful, historic day, and, uh, it's just amazing what  we're seeing.  And Anderson Cooper is so mo for Obama.  You think he wants a little.  He is so mo for him.  You think he wants a little brown sugar? 
[00:05:30]  Oh.  Dude, he was drooling.  Every time he's on camera, he's just, oh, and look at him.  Look at the way he speaks and dances.  No, that's a man.  Man.  Everything.  He's fantastic.  Oh, that's funny.  I didn't notice that.  Oh, Anderson Cooper was just.  Bravo.  Oof.  Bravo.  Yeah, it was, uh, uh, coverage was amazing.  Yeah, but you know what?  Uh, no one's going to say anything bad, and you have to take your cue from someone like  Dick Cheney.  Even Dick Cheney was rah, rah, rah, was seeing something special. 
[00:06:00]  You know, I don't care that I don't agree with this guy or half these people on the platform.  This is something that is, like, history and the exchanging of power, and he was, like,  really, really into it.  He's just trying to make peace with the Lord.  Yeah, no kidding.  I think he's, you know.  You know what?  I, uh, no matter what, I still hate the news.  Oh.  They don't give you the real story.  I mean, they're trying to say Dick Cheney's in a wheelchair because he moved a couple boxes  and pulled a muscle on his back. 
[00:06:30]  Let me tell you something.  If you're going to be seen in front of a billion people, they're saying at least a billion people  around the world watch that, right?  Oh, yeah.  I saw some video from other countries, too.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  God, I feel sorry for the animals yesterday that had to die.  Poor animals.  My God.  How many?  Oh, my God.  Really?  Think about it.  There was some sacrificing going on yesterday showing that we got a long way to go before  we're one big happy village. 
[00:07:00]  Planet.  Yeah.  Planet.  Oh, my God.  But Cheney, the doctor said, well, he pulled a muscle moving some boxes, but, you know,  and it's no big deal, but suggest that Cheney, you know, be in a wheelchair for two days.  Yeah.  No man.  We could speak as men here.  No man wants to be seen in a wheelchair, first of all, ever.  Second of all, if you're going to be in front of a billion people.  Yeah.  If it was no big deal, but the doctor still suggests a wheelchair for a couple days, when 
[00:07:30]  you get your ass up on a cane or something, you don't want to be seen like that.  A couple of Vicodin and get their ass out there.  Right.  Because guess what?  When we're long gone, they're going to be showing Cheney in a wheelchair.  Yeah.  And everyone's going to think that, wow, at the end of his vice president run, he was  a cripple.  That's all they're going to think now.  Now, they're not going to remember that he, quote, you know, hurt himself moving a box  or two.  Those guys don't move their own boxes.  First of all, we haven't seen that.  I'm a shock jock and I don't move my own boxes.  You think a vice president moves his own boxes? 
[00:08:00]  We hadn't seen him in how long before the inauguration?  No one even saw him.  Can I say close to a year?  Yeah.  Is that about right?  They've been hiding him away.  Is that about right?  Maybe.  For the most part.  He did swear the new senators in.  So he was in the Senate chamber.  But, you know, I don't think we saw him go in and out.  We just saw him there doing the swearing in.  Right.  No one really saw him, you know, and then he comes out in public like that in a wheelchair.  So that was a little suspect.  There's so much to talk about.  How about we do this?  Because, I mean, it's almost, it's overwhelming. 
[00:08:30]  So why don't we go to the phones and we'll let the, you know, the listeners kind of guide  us through all the viewing that was going on.  Initially what they were thinking.  Let's go to Stryker.  Stryker.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Well, let's see.  It's Obama plus 16 hours.  The stock market went down 4% of value last night.  NYMEX crude is up 4% this morning.  Brent crude is up 1%.  And three gas stations on my way to work this morning are up almost a dime in value. 
[00:09:00]  Yep.  Obama president now.  Obama president now.  Yeah, the stock market.  It's a little pancake.  Wow.  Yeah.  Down 300 and something.  That was the bank.  Below 8,000.  That was the bank's financials just like tanked.  There was a reason for it.  It wasn't.  More bank trouble on the way.  Believe me.  I'd love to pin everything on Obama.  But even I'm saying, you know, that was the banks.  They're already whispering that there might be some serious problems with these banks still. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, yeah.  They're still asking for more money.  And now they don't know where the other half of this tarp money is going.  I'm getting a little nervous.  I've got to move everything.  Oh, you're thinking you've got to start moving some money around?  Not some.  Everything.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Are you in one of those banks?  Yeah, I'm one of those banks with the weird logo.  Oof.  It looks like a minor league team.  Wait, it almost looks like the Yankee logo.  Who? 
[00:10:00]  Gatsby, New York.  How are you?  You're great.  How are you doing?  Hey.  What's up?  I'm frightened.  I'm frightened that the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court has one line to say.  You break it up into seven parts, and he still screws it up.  You know, we're kind of arguing this a little bit.  I think the Chief Justice messed up first, threw Obama off his game, and then he got all messed up.  And then Obama stopped because he realized that the Chief Justice then, what, flipped a couple of the words and was like, no, that's not how it is, dummy. 
[00:10:30]  I saw it as the Chief Justice, given the first line out, Obama jumping the gun.  I think he jumped the gun and started repeating the Chief Justice before the Chief Justice was done with the first line that Obama was supposed to repeat.  Right.  And that just confused everybody.  Right.  And at that point, it fell apart.  Which just proves, even to the last second, Obama was like, oh, my God, they can take this away from me any second. 
[00:11:00]  I better get this in.  Because he rushed through it like Obama was, bam, bam, bam.  He wanted to get through it really quick.  Yeah.  You know how depressing that's going to be for him?  It's like, oh, the big moment.  And that's what they're going to show over and over again for decades to come.  Me messing up.  Orenthal, James Simpson verdict line.  Orenthal, Orenthal.  We just talked about that last week.  People, you know, having that moment and they just mess it up.  Yeah.  What was the last one?  We just did this.  It was a big one, too. 
[00:11:30]  Wasn't it the Simpson verdict?  Huh?  No, I don't know.  No, no, no.  It was recent.  It was recent.  It was something else.  We're like, what happens to these people?  They got...  Governor Patterson.  Oh, Governor Patterson with the miracle on the Hudson.  Miracle on 49th Street, he said.  Yeah, miracle on 49th Street.  Oh, I mean, that was a miracle on 34th Street.  Here's how it went down, the oath.  Are you prepared to take the oath, Senator?  I am.  Never.  I, Barack Hussein Obama.  I, Barack...  Do solemnly swear.  I, Barack Hussein Obama.  All right, all right, cut it right there.  Cut it right there.  He goes, I, Barack Hussein Obama... 
[00:12:00]  I can't even say it.  Do solemnly swear.  And that's what Obama was supposed to repeat.  Obama started repeating his name first.  Right.  He just wanted it to stop at I, Barack Hussein Obama.  Right.  But the Chief Justice meant to go longer.  Right.  And then they started stepping on us like us with stupid callers.  Right.  I thought he actually forgot Obama forgot.  No.  The last...  He just remembered, if you look at it, I thought Obama forgot the last part of the sentence  that he was supposed to say. 
[00:12:30]  And he actually was looking at him like, he gave a nod like, dude, repeat it because  I forgot the last part.  You know what would have been classic?  If Barack Hussein Obama would have turned around to the Chief Justice and gone, all right,  well, you're the president.  You go ahead.  You go ahead and just finish whenever you want.  I guess this is your party.  Go ahead.  This is all about you today.  I'm sorry.  Everyone's here for you.  I forgot.  I'll just stand aside.  Whatever.  You take the oath.  Why don't you?  It's good to know that they're panicking Pete's just like you and I and everybody else  out there. 
[00:13:00]  Everyone wants to jump the gun.  You like to think these people are like superhumans, but in the end, nah, they took a fine dump  in the morning and became president at noon.  Yeah.  Here it is again.  Are you prepared to take the oath, Senator?  I am.  Well, I don't think you are.  After all this, nah.  Right.  Are you prepared to take the oath, Senator?  I am.  I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear.  I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear.  This is very easy to find out. 
[00:13:30]  Then he screwed up.  But just go through past inaugurations.  Do they stop right there or does, or is it, or is it that whole line?  That's the end.  And are they all broken up at the same spot each time on every inauguration?  It just sucks that the big moment is just blown.  Are you prepared to take the oath, Senator?  I am.  I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear.  I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear.  That I will execute the office of President to the United States faithfully. 
[00:14:00]  That I will execute.  Faithfully the office of President of the United States faithfully.  And will, to the best of my ability.  And will, to the best of my ability.  Preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.  Preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.  So help you God.  So help me God.  Congratulations, Mr. President.  Is he the president?  I mean.  Yeah, what happened?  It's one dopey news network. 
[00:14:30]  And look, I hate them all.  I just want to get that out there.  I'm not a fan of Fox over CNN or MSN.  I don't like any of them.  Because they're still not giving you the real news.  You know, they should have gave us Ted Kennedy flopping around like a fish.  That's the type of guy I am.  I want to see news, whether or anything at all.  I want to see it all.  If it's horrific, then show it.  Yeah.  But one of the news channels, I don't know which one.  Well, I don't know.  Is he really the president?  I mean, if you mess up the oath like that, who was it?  It was Fox. 
[00:15:00]  It was Fox.  They were immediately saying, well, has he been properly sworn in?  Is it legal?  There could be some questions.  There's an amendment, I think it's the 20th, that says that at noon, no matter what, no  matter what, he's president.  The oath is, you know, kind of a...  Afterthought.  Yeah.  It's whatever it is.  It's kind of a show thing.  He was already president by the time he did.  Who is this Jerry guy?  Yeah.  I got a guy obviously not listening.  Jerry.  Jerry, what's up, man?  Hey, Jerry from Connecticut.  How you doing?  What's that?  What's the scoop? 
[00:15:30]  Well, the deal is, is that, you know, number one, the chief justice is the one that screwed  up.  Well, no, no, no, no.  I would stick to what you called for.  I see Ant is an idiot.  Go roll.  All right.  Roll with that.  Why am I an idiot?  Because you're like, you know, Obama, you know, caused the stock market to go down.  Obama didn't cause the stock market.  All right.  Unless you're kidding.  Any more than Bush did for the last 10 years.  Jerry, all right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Unless you're kidding, you are a complete idiot who isn't listening to me. 
[00:16:00]  Did you hear what I said?  What did I say?  What did I say about Obama and the stock market mere minutes ago?  You said that it's probably the bank.  I didn't say it's probably.  I said I'd love to blame Obama for the market, but it's not his fault.  The financials took a dump yesterday, and that's why the stock market went down.  So how is that me blaming Obama?  Jerry, Connecticut, go.  Because you have been blaming Obama for everything for the last.  Oh, my.  Jerry, we got to hang up.  Let me blame Obama for you. 
[00:16:30]  Because you're an idiot.  There's definitely a lot of reasons to yell at Anthony, but, I mean, Anthony.  Thank you.  But Anthony did not blame, you know, the little slip we had yesterday down there on Wall Street on Obama.  Thanks, Jerry, though.  Thank you.  You reinforced something today.  Some of you idiots just don't listen.  All right, the phones are lit, so we're going to take a quick break.  I can't believe 20 minutes have gone by already.  This is going to be a very, very busy show.  We got Kennedy okay after seizure. 
[00:17:00]  We got celebrity reaction to Obama inauguration.  The first cut is hilarious.  Oprah saying, I'm wearing men's pantyhose.  You got Tom Brokaw.  We played this late in the show yesterday.  We'll give it another spin.  He had a major faux pas yesterday.  Faux pas.  And we got man on the street stuff and just more stuff coming in as we speak.  What's this?  George Bush almost screws up his oath. 
[00:17:30]  The first Bush.  Really?  What, the older Bush or the first Bush on the second inauguration?  I mean, the first Bush on the first inauguration?  The second Bush on the first or second inauguration?  George H.W. Bush.  George H.W. Bush.  Almost showed up in the same spot.  Herbert Weeble Wobble.  Bush, did you see the way he was walking?  Whack, whack, whack, like the penguin.  Right.  There was whack, whack, whack, whack.  He just waddled back and forth with a cane.  He just waddled.  It's just so depressing.  It's sad to watch.  What time does to these powerful people. 
[00:18:00]  Cheney looking like Dr. Strangelove or something up there.  And freaking Bush Sr. waddling around.  And who looked like, what did they say?  I care.  All right, whatever.  Let me play this.  That's called punching out people.  Repeat after me.  I, George Herbert Walker Bush, do solemnly swear.  I, George Herbert Walker Bush, do solemnly swear.  That I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States.  That I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States. 
[00:18:30]  So he almost did the Obama thing.  So I guess that whole line is supposed to be.  That first line, just, yeah, wait for him to pause.  Jesus, these guys want to be president so bad.  Yeah.  How long is the campaign and the election and everything?  We're talking two years?  They've been going at it.  Hey, Obama, relax for a couple of seconds.  Let the guy talk.  All right, we're going to step aside for a second here and continue with the Opie and Anthony  Show.  Robert Kelly in the studio. 
[00:19:00]  Yes.  One of my vacationing Jim Norton.  Hi.  No, he's actually down in Miami.  Miami for a couple of days, yeah.  And now you can take off your coat and everything.  Look at how thin you are.  Oh.  Yeah, who was saying that?  Was it Joe DeRosa that was really calling you a son of a bitch?  Joe DeRosa called me a son of a bitch?  Yeah.  Yeah, he did.  He was like, because you're bummed out that I actually had shoulders.  It was.  He doesn't have shoulders.  He was all, just like all of us.  He has to wear a turtleneck sweater just so it stays on him.  All right.  You're annoying everyone with your weight loss. 
[00:19:30]  Stop it already.  But I'm also inspiring some of you.  Anorexic.  Fat fans.  I hope you turn anorexic.  Do you?  Yeah.  Me too.  Maybe I'll get an acting gig.  You're thin.  Your legs look like a little colt.  Little Colin Quinn ostrich legs.  All right.  Right back to the phones after the break.  Opie and Anthony starring Robert Kelly today.  I'm going to break something today.  It's already broken.  I didn't touch that one.  Please fix our crap. 
[00:20:00]  That's the least you can do for this fine radio show that you're fortunate enough to have in your company.  Fix our crap.  Let's change America.  It's going to happen.  It's going to get fixed.  Obama president.  Nah.  Guess what?  In the year 2009, CD players aren't supposed to weigh 50 pounds.  877-212-ON-A.  We'll get back to the phones in a second.  They just make it so much harder to do a radio show.  Yeah.  Get new shit in here. 
[00:20:30]  All right, Ant.  Robert Kelly sitting in for Jim Norton.  How many of us sweatpants on today?  I'm doing sweatpants now.  Sweatpants?  That's what you're doing now?  Yeah.  I would shower and put on clothes every morning.  For what?  For who?  To see these guys?  I know.  And then you're home by 11, 11, 15.  No one saw me.  So why?  I'm going to start coming in in my pajamas.  This is just like the segue into PJs.  I'm going to roll out of bed in my PJs and do this radio show. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  I used to wake up, do the same thing, take a shower, get up like an hour and a half early.  Yeah.  I'm brushing my teeth and flossing and conditioning.  And I'm like, why am I doing all this?  It's bad enough you get up so early.  So I just, a little water on my face.  Got to brush the teeth still, obviously.  And then you roll out the door.  Got the food pocket fixed too, so.  What's the food pocket?  That's where there's a little pocket where your tooth is or in a gum, in your gum. 
[00:21:30]  And then food impacts in there and stuff's rotting.  I used to like that when I was fat.  A little snack.  Suck out a little snack.  Suck out a little pork.  Oh, pork.  Oh, my God.  Hey, so we're talking about what happened yesterday.  Everybody was watching TV for the most part.  What do you want to do now, Ant?  That damn city player messed up my rhythm.  Let's see.  We can go to. 
[00:22:00]  Well, we can start with this.  The Tom Brokaw.  That was from yesterday, right?  Yeah, but it's worth playing again.  Tom Brokaw just had an awful slip of the tongue.  I understand it's live TV and all that, but this is a good one.  This is a really good one.  Yeah.  You know, one of the things I've been watching is that hats are back.  Jack Kennedy almost ruined the hat industry in America by appearing headless when he made  his inaugural address. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, boy, what a full paw.  Showing that they probably should push him back into retirement.  Wow.  In the last, what, six to eight months, they've kind of brought him out of retirement.  He's seen more of them than we did on NBC Nightly News.  Yeah, definitely.  So that's a great slip up.  If you're going to slip up, that's a beautiful one right there.  Not quite as good as his tax cuts.  No.  The one that he said one day, which we can't even play on the air.  No.  Because cuts just blatantly came out as something else. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  One of the big Adam Baum words.  I wish I was smart right now.  Oh, my God.  Cuts?  Yeah.  The C word.  It came out as the word.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, we're allowed to play it, aren't we?  No.  We're not allowed to play it anymore?  I don't know.  Look, if our audience behaves, we will play Aretha Franklin, and we won't comment about  how she sang My Country. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Ma, ma.  What's the next word?  Tis of thee.  Tis of thee.  She paused at the, I mean, you're supposed to sort of pause in the middle of country,  but wow.  Yeah, there's certainly.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah, there is kind of a pause there.  So, if everyone behaves, we'll just play it, because it's part of history.  Stunt brain, and we won't comment, and we'll just, you know, give people a couple lines  of Aretha Franklin singing yesterday, okay? 
[00:24:00]  Aretha.  Hey, there was another.  Nice hat she was wearing, by the way.  Dude, what was that about?  I don't know.  It looked like something that should be on Ted Kennedy's head.  Keeping his brains in.  Wow, it looks like a bandage.  Had a big bow on it.  Anything to distract from the hugeness of her body.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  Jeez.  Speaking of Kennedy, they're saying he was flopping like a mother-effer.  Yeah.  This wasn't a little seizure he had at the luncheon.  Yeah, well, he was out on the Capitol. 
[00:24:30]  What do they call that area, anyway?  The Rotunda or something?  No, that's inside the little balcony.  Oh, yeah.  I've been on that balcony.  Wherever they swear it went.  Were you, President Kelly?  I was.  I got a tour of the Capitol building, and I...  That would be impressive if that was yesterday.  Yeah.  It was.  You were there yesterday.  Yes.  That's why I wasn't available yesterday to come and say I was there yesterday.  All right.  Yeah, sure.  He was out there, though, for the inauguration. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  And then when they went in for the luncheon, he had a seizure, and they ended up taking  him to the hospital because of his brain, you know.  They said because of fatigue.  Yeah, they said fatigue.  The fatigue brought on the seizure.  So he should be getting released today, they said.  But they said, hey, that's just part of it.  They had no answer, like, well, we're going to do this or that.  They just, no.  Eh.  Send him home.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  But it was exhaustion.  So, meh.  You know, you're talking about the...  We were doing... 
[00:25:30]  Before you move on, they didn't allow cameras in the luncheon, unfortunately, the first  part, or that would have been on live TV, like, holy crap.  But when they finally allowed the cameras to go live, you could see it on everyone's  faces that they just saw something horrific.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They walked out, and the news was interviewing some of the people that were in there and  asking, all right, well, what happened?  He goes, well, he had an episode, and he was taken away to the hospital.  And then the news was asking, well, what happened?  Could you describe what happened? 
[00:26:00]  And there was a pause.  I don't remember who they were asking, but there was a pause.  And then the guy just goes, no, I won't comment on that.  So, obviously, it wasn't just him kind of teetering over in his seat and, oh, let's help  him.  He was doing the worm on the floor.  A little bit softer now.  Yeah, exactly.  Is it true that the Obama kids jumped on Ted because they thought it was one of those  little, oh, no.  What do they call it outside the supermarkets?  You put a couple quarters in and have a little ride?  Oh, no. 
[00:26:30]  It's the Ted Kennedy ride for the kids.  That was very nice of him to do that.  Those kids had me bored by that point.  And then someone else got scared.  Senator Byrd.  Yeah, Senator Byrd.  He got scared like a little bird and he was asked to be taken to the hospital.  Well, when you're his age, how old is Byrd?  Ninety-one.  Ninety-one, you know.  You see someone flopping on the floor, you're like, ah, before that happens, maybe I should  get out of here.  Or that could, yeah, make you go into some kind of, you know, heart attack mode or something. 
[00:27:00]  Seizure.  Yeah, there's a little seizure.  Here's another reporter messing up yesterday.  So, a message of inclusiveness really resonating here in Freedom Plaza, so named.  Because Dr. King, Martin Luther King Jr., actually wrote part of his I Dream is, I, I'm sorry.  He wrote part of his I Have a Dream speech nearby at the Willard Hotel.  Pardon me, it's been a long morning so far, Wolf.  But certainly, despite the brain freeze here, a lot of people are very enthusiastic. 
[00:27:30]  Kevin from Connecticut.  I didn't know Kevin from Connecticut was down there yesterday.  He writes, Ted Kennedy still has my wallet in his mouth.  And all Kevin is asking for is his wallet back.  Is that what you're supposed to do when someone's having a seizure?  I don't know, a spoon or a wallet?  It still has Kennedy's teeth in it.  It's an unbelievable day, though, man.  All right.  Let's see. 
[00:28:00]  Let's go to Dave in Jersey.  Dave.  How are you doing, guys?  Pretty good, Dave.  Hey, I know you guys aren't talking about this anymore, but I'm a long-time listener.  I love you guys.  But, Anthony, you know, 99% of the things you say, I agree with.  The only problem I have is today how you're saying black people need to do this.  Black people need to get their, you know, house in order.  Now, obviously, it's not all black people.  There's a lot of upstanding black people out there.  If you go to trailer parks, there's just as many white trash scum, you know, that mommy and daddy are actually brother and sister, you know, with 17, you know, elephant kids, you know, living off government cheese. 
[00:28:30]  I mean, there's just as many white trash as there is, you know, drug dealers and all.  White trash is different.  White trash is different than black trash, I guess.  What do you want to call it?  Black trash?  It's just different.  No.  White trash, black trash.  Whatever you want to call it.  Obama's president.  I could speak my mind like that.  Obama president now. 
[00:29:00]  What am I saying bad?  What am I saying bad?  What is the difference?  What is the difference?  What is the difference up here?  I've walked through trailer parks unscathed.  I cannot walk through certain neighborhoods that are predominantly black unscathed.  That's because you look like a meth dealer.  All right.  Sorry.  That's pretty funny.  Whatever.  I mean, Patrice can walk through a Harlem unscathed, too.  But he, you know.  And he could probably walk through a trailer park, too.  Unscathed?  Yeah.  Really? 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  But it might be your color, though.  Just go out.  I'm just saying.  You're just one of them.  Look.  It's color-wise when you're walking through, like, a trailer park.  Obama said the same goddamn thing I said yesterday.  He said last night.  It's time to get to work.  Mm-hmm.  Get your families together.  Mm-hmm.  You know, and make something of yourself.  And, you know, he's addressing everybody.  I know that.  But it's also there's a disproportionate number, my friend. 
[00:30:00]  It's 10% of the American population.  Maybe 11% is African-American.  The rest are white.  And you see, you know, a 50% prison rate amongst whites.  Whites against blacks.  Or not even whites against blacks.  It's, you know, blacks, Hispanics.  You know, then you get a few poor white stupid guys in prison.  But, you know, it's a disproportionate number is what I'm saying.  That's what I was saying.  Can I ask you a question? 
[00:30:30]  Sure.  Do you think that the media and Hollywood today, the movies that come out,  are contributing to the fact that we're so separate as whites on one side  blacks on the other side?  No.  Security cameras are.  I've been through.  Watch the first 48.  Watch a marathon of first 48.  It's a show about detectives all over the country that from the time there's a  murder committed to the time 48 hours goes by, they have to try to solve the 
[00:31:00]  murder because once the first 48 goes by, it's very hard to find out who did it.  99% of these cases are black on black crime.  99%.  The rest is black on white.  And then a very small part is white on white.  I think I saw one episode where it's white on white.  There's a huge problem with black on black violence.  That, I think, should be addressed more than, you know, anything I was saying. 
[00:31:30]  Just the way, you know, it's the way, why, it's the truth.  Look at what's going on in the world.  Why can't, I'm not speaking.  Thanks, Dave.  Thank you, Dave.  Thank you, Dave.  Out my hole over here.  I'm just saying what you see on a daily basis.  Thanks, Dave.  And Obama's saying transcend that.  Thank you, Dave.  And a lot of black leaders were saying perhaps Obama, being president and working himself  up like he did, will inspire some of these people that would normally be driven into 
[00:32:00]  a life of crime.  I'd love to see it.  I watched the whole biography on Obama and how he worked himself up.  And just amazing.  The dedication and hard work this guy put in to go to Harvard Law School was astounding.  You know?  It really was.  I completely have respect for the guy when it comes to that.  I don't agree with his policies worth a damn, but that's what he's talking about. 
[00:32:30]  If you look at the work that went into that and the dedication, it is true.  Anyone could do it.  But you make a decision at a young age like he did, instead of, you know, slinging dope  or trying to impress your friggin' gangbangers in your hood by nailing someone, you can actually  make something of yourself in this country.  It's not so entrenched in racism anymore where a black person cannot make it to the pinnacle 
[00:33:00]  of the free world, the presidency.  There you go.  So I don't want to hear it.  All right.  Shut up, Bob.  Oh, my God.  The presidency is like becoming famous.  It's like 10%.  No, it isn't.  He could have been a basketball star, then, what you're saying.  That's just as big as the American public voting you in.  It's not an MTV movie award.  Yeah, but he got voted in not because of who he is as a person.  I mean, watch American Idol.  Dude, color had a lot to do with it.  A billion people that...  Color had a lot to do with it.  What, getting voted in?  Yes.  It was a perfect storm, though, man. 
[00:33:30]  The Republicans had nobody, and then they take Sarah Palin to really F up their chances.  Yeah.  It was a perfect storm.  I just say all bets are off.  And there was a woman.  It was either a woman or a black guy.  All bets are off.  All right.  Let's get back to the...  Everyone can succeed in this country.  It's an amazing place.  Let's get back to the fun.  That's not true.  They're still talking about...  That's not true.  It is, too.  Oh, no.  You're an idiot.  Who can...  There's certain people that can't.  Not because of the country, but because of who they are.  Most people are morons.  Oh, I'm not talking about the morons.  I'm talking about if you're a motivated, intelligent person in this country, you have a shot. 
[00:34:00]  You have a good chance of making something of yourself.  Dedication.  Instead of trying to take a quick way out and not taking that job that might get you a few bucks to work your way to the next level.  And thinking, you know, you've got to sling dope so you're making a fortune every day because you're too good to work at some crap job and make money and then go to the next level.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah, but we need ditch diggers.  Word needs ditch diggers, too, you know.  All right.  I'm sure that's why we allow it again. 
[00:34:30]  That's why we allow the illegals to come into this country.  Who are you kidding?  It's a fact.  They do everything that we don't want to do.  It's been said many times in many different ways.  People still talking about Ted Kennedy.  Now, Ann, you know a little bit about history.  This person, and it's a good line, but if you're going to have feedback from cell phones, you've got to put your name in there so you get a little credit.  This guy writes, that's because his father.  This is why Ted Kennedy had a seizure.  That's because his father punished him for being there. 
[00:35:00]  Joe Kennedy was a blatant racist.  Is that true, Anthony?  Was Ted Kennedy's father a racist?  I don't know about racist.  I know he had some socialist ties.  They were a little afraid of him being a socialist.  Right.  Racist?  I don't know.  All right.  I'll tell you about Disney.  You know, he was a blazing anti-Semite.  No kidding.  And then Cody in Utah.  Maybe Ted Kennedy was just trying to show off his hip-hop dance moves to Obama.  It's like old school breakdancing. 
[00:35:30]  Did they put a piece of cardboard out for him?  I think Obama's sitting up there going, wow, that's very nice of Ted to do a little old school street hip-hop stuff for us.  Oh, the cunning linguist is saying Joe Kennedy was not a racist.  Just ask his slaves.  All right.  That's uncalled for on this second day.  And then Austin from Austin, Texas.  Texas, excuse me, says CNN sure talked a lot about Obama's balls last night.  Yes. 
[00:36:00]  I was watching Obama's balls all night long.  A lot of them.  Right.  Ten of them, I believe.  Right.  And because everyone's behaving, I thought one of the fine moments.  Behaving is nothing but me getting bashed.  I know.  Don't look over there.  Behaving.  Trying to keep it fun for a little while, and then we'll get a little son of a bitch.  I don't care.  I love him.  And then we'll get to bash me on this.  An outrageous Anthony a little later.  Because everyone's behaving, and it was such a fine moment when Aretha Franklin came out there. 
[00:36:30]  Wasn't it?  I just want to play a line or two from the fine song she sang for everybody yesterday.  All right.  All right.  Holy Jesus.  No offense, Aretha.  We really don't need to know anything about that.  Wow.  I'm going to be taking a pause because you just had to take a bite of a steak and cheese and 
[00:37:00]  it makes me sense.  Boy, that was a hell of a breath.  One of the greatest pauses in history right there.  Oh, you just don't take a breath in that spot.  If you do, you're not supposed to.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Ant can't take criticism.  Black History Month needs to show more black people like Obama, not just entertainers.  Ant needs to lose voice more.  Let's him explain points in calmer fashion. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, okay.  That's true.  Ant sounds like a retard.  Movies and TV reinforce stereotypes.  Well, what about the good TV?  Yeah, what about the good TV?  What about the good movies?  What about the good stuff?  Yeah, what about that?  What about those insightful movies where the white teacher comes in and cleans up the black  classroom?  Isn't that inspiring?  Why don't people go, yeah, that's good.  I'm going to do that instead of just laughing at those movies for the drivel they are?  Movies and TV are reflections of the world. 
[00:38:00]  They don't influence the world.  Some people have influence?  Yeah.  Some people are influenced by a pinwheel dummy.  But as far as TV and other entertainment media contributing to people's actions, stop it.  It's a reflection.  People make movies about things that are happening.  The other things are called science fiction.  That's what's going to happen.  It's science fiction or reality. 
[00:38:30]  What do you think?  You sit down and watch Menace to Society or Boys in the Hood and don't think that wasn't  happening at the time those movies came out?  People saw it and went, wow, I'll invent this crack stuff and start selling it and do drive-bys.  No.  It was a reflection of what was happening in South Central at the time.  Robert Kelly sitting in for Jim Norton today.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  Love Bloppy.  Also, it's been blown up the last couple of days.  I want to say hi to everyone on Twitter. 
[00:39:00]  Are you doing the Twitter yet, Ed?  I'm Facebooking it, my friend.  That's all right.  We're all Twittering.  That's nice.  I like checking in.  See what's up.  I'm doing the Face.  We're all...  We've got everything covered.  Yeah.  You've got the PalTalk covered.  You've got the Facebook covered.  MySpace.  Jimmy's doing the MySpace and the voicemails.  I do all four.  You're doing all four?  I can't be...  I have Say Now, too, which is the...  What's that?  What?  Which is the phone number.  You can have your own phone number, but I just started tweeting.  I have 300 friends.  I like Twitter because, for me, it's very simple and easy. 
[00:39:30]  It's easy.  It's extremely easy.  Facebook's easy on the phone, too, so I can do it on my iPhone.  A little texting and a little picture taken, and that's all I need.  What do you mean?  That's all I need.  You can put pictures on this?  I ain't explaining that one to you.  You can put a picture?  I'm not going to explain that to you.  Why?  I'm on Twitter, too.  This is opening up another whole world of intercommunication between people on the whole planet.  Things like Twitter and Facebook and other medium where the phones now, it's so easy 
[00:40:00]  to snap a picture, upload it, comment.  That's where the news is getting a lot of their breaking stories from now.  I was breaking news yesterday on Twitter for my peeps.  Was he?  For my eyeballs.  I got a lot of eyeballs.  They're called eyeballs out there.  I'm learning about the Internet, finally, in the year 2009.  I'm collecting eyeballs.  That's the new term.  How many eyeballs you got?  I wonder if some of these guys that are following me only have one eyeball.  How do you count the eyeballs? 
[00:40:30]  But I got eyeballs.  And I was like, instead of CNN, I was O-N-N yesterday.  I broke the news of Ted Kennedy.  You did?  I even threw a little Pat from Menachie line out there for everybody.  I saw that one.  That was very funny.  But I didn't know how to do the, how do you spell when you're texting?  F and M and F and then some H's.  M-R-F-F?  Yeah.  M-R-F-F-F.  Yeah.  There's people saying hack.  I'm like, yeah, that's why I said in Pat Menachie.  It only works if you do it as a Pat from Menachie gets away with a lot of those hacky lines 
[00:41:00]  because of his effing delivery.  Could the governor of New York Twitter?  Oh, wow.  Or do you need the good eyeballs?  Yeah.  If he's listening, I don't need you to follow me because I can't count your eyeballs.  He can't count his eyeballs.  It's all about counting eyeballs.  Eyeballs.  And I'm not telling you how you do that picture thing.  Why?  But this Twitter thing is very easy for me.  I like this.  Yeah, but you can't.  I don't get replies.  I like Facebook because you put something up there.  Two seconds later, you see everything that you said about it. 
[00:41:30]  You get replies if you say or do something interesting.  Do I have to follow everybody?  I don't follow crap.  You don't follow anybody.  It's too hard.  Everybody follows you.  Well, yeah, because it's just for the show.  I just comment about the show and stuff.  I can't follow.  One way.  This is why nobody can be assassinated anymore.  There's just too much stuff.  Imagine they had this like on the grassy knoll Twitter and Facebook and iPhones.  You'd find out who did everything.  Oh, you'd have one of those CNN 3D views of the guys. 
[00:42:00]  That was an interesting thing, too, this inauguration, watching him go and dancing with his wife on stage.  And you would see the back of the crowd shot and just everyone holding up their phones.  That was crazy, right?  It looked like some weird alien way to show your appreciation.  But it messed up Jay-Z's rap at the end where he was like, hold your lighters up because nobody had lighters.  They had lighters?  They had cell phones.  Like cell phones.  Yeah, but if you've been to a concert lately, it's all about just holding your cell phone up and showing the light that way now. 
[00:42:30]  Or you get your app of flame on your iPhone and you can hold up a little lighter flame.  Speaking of phones, you were saying how this is how people are communicating.  I was thinking just yesterday that, especially the younger demos, once again, they don't make phone calls anymore with their phone.  They're texting their asses off or updating their Facebook or what have you.  I hate speaking calls.  But, I mean, because I hang out with the Philly crew and stuff.  These guys do not make phone calls with their cell phones. 
[00:43:00]  It's all about, oh, I'm here.  It's all just texting away.  Yeah.  So, I mean, is it possible that your actual cell phone won't be used to take phone calls anymore?  Isn't that odd?  That's a question.  Just texting.  You'll take the rare phone call, I guess.  You know what?  When you could send pictures and text, why bother talking?  Right.  It's like, hey, here's what's going on.  Well, you know what's going to change?  What are you doing?  Video.  They've got the live video phone coming up.  Yeah, yeah.  That's going to change it.  Once that starts happening.  You can answer the phone and actually see somebody. 
[00:43:30]  Right.  Sex is going to change.  Ugh.  Well, of course it'll be used.  It already is video conferencing.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Speaking of Twitter, and people are laughing at me, Twitter, no one uses that.  They're using Facebook.  Look, man, the ONA community, like, jumped on Twitter the last couple of days, so we'll  try to make it into something.  Someone took Opie.  Whoever you are, you're an ass.  So, I'm Opie Radio on Twitter.  I call him out.  I write him back and say, dude, thanks for holding my spot.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Now, leave.  Give me my stupid name back.  It's either, that name is either for me or Ron Howard. 
[00:44:00]  Howard, not you.  That's sad.  And even Ron Howard, when I met him, goes, wow, I know of you because, you know.  Do you think it goes in that order, you and Ron Howard, or do you think if Ron Howard  had it, would you be, hey, Ron, come on, I'm Opie.  Look, I could ask for my name from everybody out there.  The only person that could ask me for Opie is Ron Howard.  That's how it works, right?  Wouldn't you think?  I'm calling you up and asking, can I have my Twitter name, please?  I'm the second most popular Opie in the world. 
[00:44:30]  Of course.  All right?  And somebody has my name on Twitter.  You're not Ron Howard or May.  Give me my effing name back until Ron Howard wants it.  But it's Opie Radio on Twitter.  And I think Robert Kelly's on there as well.  See, your name is too complicated.  Because Comedy Central set the Twitter thing up for me.  Well, they're stupid.  That's Comedy Central.  It's R under slash Kelly.  I know, it does suck.  And your Facebook is very obvious.  It's just, yeah, Anthony Cumia. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, that's too much updating.  I think I'm your friend.  No, I like that.  You are my friend.  It's not updating like it is, though, on MySpace, where you know you've got to update  and stuff like that.  And it's a lot easier interface to pop video up and pictures and reply to people.  And you don't even have to reply.  You can just pop up whatever statements you want.  Right.  But I like getting into it.  Love you guys.  We're just ignoring stunt brain.  I know.  His arms are flailing.  Break, break.  Facebook.  Break.  We've lost a lot more hair just trying to get us to go to break. 
[00:45:30]  Got one of those Rogaine film things coming up for everybody.  Coming up.  All right.  When we get back, we've got to talk about Obama getting out of the beast.  That's the name of his limo, presidential limo.  We've got to talk about.  The things you say and the things that it makes me think.  We've got to talk about the transfer of power that happened.  The peaceful transfer of power.  With Bush just getting out of town immediately.  But that happens with every president.  Ridden out on a rail, though.  Oof.  We'll get into that. 
[00:46:00]  Not a fond farewell for him.  We'll get into the balls and there was something.  Oh, the poet.  Poetry stinks.  Why is that a part of it?  Yeah, we'll talk about that.  Poetry does stink.  Opian Anthony.  Robert Kelly.  You're checking out the Opian Anthony Show.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  I heard that Kennedy did not have a seizure yesterday.  It was just Aretha stepping on his head to try to get to the buffet.  Oh. 
[00:46:30]  Well, that's not nice.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Phone number 877-212-0&A.  All right.  What else do you want to talk about as far as yesterday goes?  Well, it was a huge tag.  Uh, Obama inaugurated and all the balls they went to.  But, like I said, no criticism at all from the media.  Not even from that minister guy or whatever he was at the end of the inauguration. 
[00:47:00]  The black guy that got up there and, um, made his little rhymes.  Mm-hmm.  Made his little nursery rhyme.  They got everybody chuckling right up until the last part where, again, Whitey has to be blamed.  It was kind of fun to have a Dr. Seuss poem to end the whole thing.  Dr. Seuss poem.  I hate poetry.  I hate poets.  Well, the poetry, the poems, all that crap.  She was horrid.  She was, I don't, I don't understand, uh, poetry. 
[00:47:30]  Call me a moron.  Uh, please.  You know what?  I would love to, but I'm right there with you.  I, I.  Thank you.  Remember in school they would, like, they would send you down that road for a while and you had to read poetry?  Yeah.  It was like, who would bother with this crap?  Awful.  And then the, the woman gets up there and stuff, and this, I don't know what kind of cadence she was using either.  Elizabeth Alexander?  It was called annoying.  Mm-hmm.  And then she's just going off and saying these things.  I, I, nothing's rhyming. 
[00:48:00]  Something about a kid on the bus.  Nothing's rhyming.  Nothing rhyming.  I don't know what the hell she's talking about.  That's the worst poetry.  They're the ones that, like, deaf poetry jam when they just, that nothing rhymes.  How about this?  But they're making such a point to themselves.  Right.  How about poems that are so effing vague?  It's like, do you want to give me a clue what you're trying to say here with your dumb poem?  Yeah.  What was the, Maya Angelou with a bird and what?  What are you trying to say?  What?  I know, I know why the caged bird sings. 
[00:48:30]  I know why the caged bird sings.  It's like a bird.  It's in a cage in your house and it won't shut up when you're on the phone.  Unless you give it a Brazilian nut.  Yeah, a Brazilian nut.  It just takes that big stupid beak.  She gnaws at it for a while.  You know, we have stupid birds.  We don't see eye to eye as far as this Obama thing goes in general.  But I got to agree with you on one thing. 
[00:49:00]  Like, Obama is trying really hard to say, like, you know, look, it's just America at this point.  Stop with, like, African American and stop with green American and stop with purple American.  It's just America.  But it's these fringe people that are still going with the whole race thing.  Because they need their gigs.  Don't they understand?  Like, people don't seem to understand.  They need racial inequality, or at least the perception thereof.  They need it to keep their job.  And they're the ones that are going to F up the whole freaking thing. 
[00:49:30]  Because people that are trying to have an open mind out there will hear one of these guys.  Because you were saying in the office, and I saw this, too, and I don't know who it was.  Oh, by the way, I'm one of those guys.  What?  What, open mind guys?  Hell no.  No, no, I'm one of those guys.  Hell no.  I keep perpetuating this crap.  But there was one guy saying, well, this is a good start.  It's like, you know what?  Yeah, yeah.  If you're trying to get people with open minds to kind of get into this whole movement that Obama is hoping to happen, 
[00:50:00]  you've got to stop with that rhetoric, because that's going to shut people down immediately.  This was a community activist that was saying, it's a good start.  And he even shushed the reporter, like, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Because hasn't Dr. Martin Luther King's dream been realized here today?  They kept doing that.  It's a very good moment.  And then you get these fringe people going, well, hey, hey.  Wait, wait, wait, no.  It's a good start.  But there's so much work that needs to be done.  What?  Ruler of the world?  The guy's the president of the United States. 
[00:50:30]  Jesus.  Enough.  Enough with a good start.  If that's a start, I hate to see the finish, because I think it's my head on a pike.  It's you with a scar on your forehead.  With a scar on my head.  You cut out his brain.  That's what it is.  A bunch of lobotomized me's.  But do we have that guy that the poet talks about a race after Obama's swearing in?  Was this the chick or the dude?  This is the dude.  This is the Dr. Seuss thing that I heard? 
[00:51:00]  Dr. Seuss, dude.  And even Obama was smiling during this because he's rhyming different races and, you know,  how it applies to America.  And then Whitey was the last one.  And, of course, we can't be involved in the fun part of the rhyme.  Well, this was the end of a five-minute invocation he gave it after the swearing in.  This reverend loud.  Five-minute invocation?  Mm-hmm.  Hey, by the way, Mick in New York, I agree with you.  He writes, the poem didn't even rhyme.  No.  But see, there's... 
[00:51:30]  I think if it doesn't rhyme, it shouldn't be a poem.  It's not a poem.  And not this one that this guy gave, the one that the woman gave.  Just poems in general.  Like, there was a whole movement where you got away from rhyming, and they're still considered poems.  Not in my world.  It's not a poem.  Roses are red.  Violets are blue.  You wrote a story that makes no sense.  Yeah.  That's what a poem is that doesn't rhyme.  Yeah.  It's a nonsensical story.  Yeah.  Third graders could do that.  Yeah.  It's a third-grade story.  You're as smart as a third grader, but you say it's a poem, then you're brilliant. 
[00:52:00]  I went to the zoo.  The zoo is fun.  Right.  My daddy works on airplanes.  Right.  Why?  Who cares?  Signed.  I'm a kid.  Maya Angelou.  And in the joy of a new beginning, we ask you to help us work for that day when black  would not be asked to give back.  Black was not asked.  Black will not be asked to give back?  To get back.  Meaning, get back.  Back of the bus, son.  I thought it said give back. 
[00:52:30]  I think it was get back.  We'll have to listen again.  And in the joy of a new beginning, we ask you to help us work for that day when black  would not be asked to give back.  To give.  Oh, get back?  Get or give.  I don't know.  Either way, it doesn't make any goddamn sense at all because no one's asking blacks to get  back.  One more try.  And in the joy of a new beginning, we ask you to help us work for that day when black  would not be asked to give back. 
[00:53:00]  I think he says give and get at the same time.  Maybe that's part of his genius.  What the hell was he saying?  I like rhymes.  It's Grady from Sanford and Son.  Alfred.  When brown can stick around.  Stick around.  Brown can stick around.  I guess that's what, illegal aliens, Mexicans, illegal aliens, when they can stay here instead 
[00:53:30]  of, you know, the INS maybe sending them back to the country that they illegally came  here from.  Jesus, mother of God.  Brown can stick around when yellow will be mellow.  Yellow will be mellow.  Wow, he doesn't like yellow.  He didn't really try to do anything with yellow.  Yellow and mellow. 
[00:54:00]  What does that mean?  I don't even know what he's talking about.  He just wants the Asians to relax a little bit on the duck sauce request.  Just relax.  Mella out.  Stop being stingy with that crap.  Why are you treated like gold?  I feel sorry for your mother.  Such a great line in the movie.  What?  What'd you say?  What does yellow and mellow mean?  That's lame, man.  Is he referring to the tension in the...  Donovan's in the community between some of the Asian store owners and some of the residents? 
[00:54:30]  Because there have been tensions.  Right.  There has been tensions between Asians and blacks in convenience stores.  Because Asians run a lot of the stores in the black communities.  And they feel like, you know, they're just draining the community of the money.  So maybe that's the yellow being mellow.  Right.  Corey Haim checking in.  Listen to the words, man.  Shut up.  That's a Jim Norton bit.  I never forgot that one.  That's so good.  Listen to the words.  I think I actually was the inspiration for that little bit of his. 
[00:55:00]  Because we were driving to Boston and I had Nirvana unplugged on.  And he didn't really know much about Nirvana.  And I'm like, no, man.  Listen to the words.  Oh, God.  And an illustrated book about birds.  For my Nirvana fans.  Brown.  When yellow will be mellow.  Yella would be mellow.  And everyone's kind of laughing and chuckling along.  And Obama's got his head back, his eyes shut. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  And he's smiling with each one of these little rhymes.  And you could see on the last one, when he brings up Whitey, his smile went down a little bit.  Just a little.  He wanted to look like, look, I'm not smiling.  Yeah.  I'm not smiling as much as mellow Yella.  Which he found funny.  Yeah.  And brown stick around.  By the way, when brown sticks around, sometimes you've got to get that brush out from next to the toilet.  Because it's so embarrassing.  Woo!  You ever do that?  No matter how many times you flush, it's like, what is this, glue? 
[00:56:00]  Scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub.  You try to unroll toilet paper and place it strategically.  So when you brush, the toilet paper will hit it on the side of the bowl.  No.  You just wait until you have to go again and you try to clean it off.  Right.  Clean it off with a number one.  Yeah, number one.  Oh, yeah.  Takes out the number two.  One beats two.  It's like rock, paper, scissors.  Got it.  On the toilet.  You have to hold it and build up a lot of pressure so that first blast just goes wha.  Then peels up a little bit of it.  We're awful, man. 
[00:56:30]  It should be said, too.  Obama, he's a young dude.  Again, you scared me.  But he is, he's a square.  Like the rest of these guys.  He dances.  He dances horrendously.  Uh-huh.  Oh, his wife was actually giving him crap.  He doesn't know what's funny, really.  He kept stepping on a dress.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was awful.  The guy didn't have time to learn how to dance or get a sense of humor.  I was watching that biography.  This guy started growing for all this. 
[00:57:00]  And just, no, he's pretty self-made as far as deciding.  Yeah, but his mama, he was in Indonesia and insisted he comes back to Hawaii and goes to  like one of the finest like high schools in America.  Yeah, it was Hawaii, though, which is...  He really did, you know, he had the motivation, though.  I mean, you decide you're going to go to...  He was a community activist in Chicago.  Uh-huh.  And then he gets an internship at a law firm. 
[00:57:30]  That's where he meets his wife.  And then it goes to Harvard Law.  Yeah, but he was in college.  Besides, when he was a community activist, that a lot of the problems that he saw were  legal-based.  So he decided he was going to take care of that by becoming a lawyer.  And then, what's that Harvard Law Journal?  He was the first president, African-American president of that, which is very competitive.  And then he decides, you know, he's going to run for office. 
[00:58:00]  Although, the last seat he won before the presidency, wow, what a debacle that was.  His Democratic contender was involved in some kind of shady deal of beating his wife.  And then, um, when he was up against his Republican friend, that's the guy that took his wife  to the sex clubs.  Oh, really?  This guy was a shoe-in.  He couldn't lose.  His competitors were just pieces of crap.  What's going on in Chicago?  Corruption up the yin-yang. 
[00:58:30]  They are some shady people.  Well, let's get back to the poem.  Yes.  The poem.  The poem.  The good part.  All right.  We continue.  The beer we have, it drank pretty good.  Budweiser.  What's the name of some of the other beers?  Budweiser and what is it?  Millers.  Miller.  Sosa.  It drank pretty good, don't it?  I don't remember that.  See, now that angered me because it eliminated so many good beers.  Right.  It's exclusion. 
[00:59:00]  You're segregating great beer.  Right, you know.  It drank pretty good.  Yeah.  This poem read pretty good.  What's some of those other poems?  Good luck with that one, Danny.  And then.  Robert Frost.  Robert Frost.  Robert Frost.  Some of the.  Emily Dickinson.  Some of the old school white Republicans were even taken with Obama's speech.  You use your tongue prettier than a $20 whore. 
[00:59:30]  And no one really caught this right at the end of the swearing in.  I boosted the level.  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Obama said this right as he was shaking hands.  I boosted the level on this.  Okay, good.  Hey, where are the white women at?  So, motivation there to be president.  I don't know.  Well, I got a couple here I could really get screwed. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Ted Kennedy was very confused because, you know, the brain seizure thing.  Was he?  Yeah, he turned to his right and said, why are we here?  Well, Negro.  Oh.  All right.  Might have been a stretch, but I liked it.  Oh.  And when Ted Kennedy was flopping around at that luncheon, Anthony. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  There was audio there.  Thank God.  Yeah.  You're going to be okay.  Oh, no.  You, as a matter of fact, Obi, you were talking about when George W. Bush and Obama were talking.  On the stairs.  On the stairs.  You were wondering what they were saying to each other.  Yeah, the transfer of power.  The transfer of power.  And a lot of people are very curious, and we may never know, but we will.  Okay.  Because, actually, it was George W. inviting Obama over to his place in Texas. 
[01:01:00]  How would you like to mow my lawn, huh?  You know, Bill Clinton was there.  Oh, was he?  He was up on, we don't know what it was, where Obama was being sworn in.  There was a lot of chatter and, like, small talk going on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he leaned over to Mondale, Walter Mondale, who was also up there, and had this to say,  and the mics picked it up.  The O.P. and Anthony mics.  Mm-hmm.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, of course it would.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Here's the luncheon, and I think you might be able to hear in the background what happened  with Ted Kennedy.  Sure.  I love Ted Kennedy.  See, that doesn't sound very good.  You know, John McCain was also at this thing.  Yes, I saw him. 
[01:02:00]  We really haven't heard from John McCain since the election.  And he was up there, and our O.P. and Anthony microphones picked up a little something he  was saying just before.  O.P. and Anthony microphones?  Yeah, we're calling them the O.P. and Anthony microphones.  You know, and our mics picked this up just before the swearing-in of Obama as president.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  Oh, yeah.  Sure. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, and when hearing that, Ted Kennedy had this to say.  I like turtles.  Well, that's good.  Oh, Mr. Kennedy.  Ted.  Oh.  Yeah.  And when she was getting on the helicopter, a few people were saying some things.  Damn!  You've just been pwned.  You know, Aretha Franklin, she was walking out, she was about to sing a wonderful rendition  of My Country, Tis Thee.  You're right. 
[01:03:00]  And our microphones picked this up.  I love the garlic butter sauce.  Well.  Anderson Cooper.  Oh, Anderson Cooper.  He was fawning over Obama.  He sure was, Anthony.  And just before they went live, Cooper wasn't, didn't realize, you know, that he was live.  Uh-huh.  I love you, Johnny Cakes.  Yeah, well.  Oh.  Not a time to say that, Mr. Cooper.  Yeah.  I want a button. 
[01:03:30]  I want a button.  I want some buttons.  I don't have buttons.  This is, uh, wow.  This is one of the people, well, of course, it was a very diverse crowd.  Yeah.  A lot of white people.  Sure.  Uh, black people just all there for Obama.  But, uh, a couple of the white people, uh, especially this guy, a little confused, uh,  when he, I think it was the first time he actually saw Obama.  Okay.  Yeah, for some reason or another, who sounded a little taller on radio? 
[01:04:00]  I love him.  Uh, people tell me, take your time setting this up, Ant.  Yeah, I know.  Hey, we're doing this on the fly.  Give us a break here.  Mm-hmm.  Ugh.  Let me see.  Well, we could go to break and really set this up.  All right, we're going to get to the rest of the poem after the break. 
[01:04:30]  And, uh, The Daily Show was, uh, commenting on the rhyming of the poem as well.  So, we might be on the same page as The Daily Show.  That would be nice.  Yeah.  I respect that show big time.  Jon Stewart and the gang.  877-212-01A, uh, audience participation day.  Still lots to talk about, about the, the coverage we saw on TV yesterday.  Okay.  Robert Kelly, are you promoting anything?  Uh, just this.  You ass.  I have a sound machine, too, Opie.  It just makes a bond sound. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, but you hit the microphone, which just made everything vibrate, so we couldn't hear  your sound machine.  Bobby, go like this first.  What?  Hold the mic for a second, and the vibrating will stop.  And then we can hear your sound machine.  I have a sound machine.  Now, hold the springs.  Oh, my God, the springs are going to...  I'm going to be in Chicago in February.  Ooh.  That was my sound machine.  Hey. 
[01:05:30]  Uh, we're back.  Hope you're in the Anthony show.  Uh, wow, we got so many sounds from the, uh, inauguration, all the, the parties, the, uh,  the luncheon, a lot of things that the news kind of just...  Well, I gotta tell you, we're everywhere.  You know, it's 2009.  2009, we're, uh, we're very into new media and really interacting with, uh, with everything  that's going on out there.  So our microphones were everywhere, Anthony, the Opie and Anthony microphones.  Yes.  Yes.  Everywhere.  And, um, well, why don't we go, we were, uh, talking about earlier, the, um, the poem, 
[01:06:00]  uh, delivered at the end of the, uh, inauguration.  Um, this, uh, touched a lot of people, I think.  It's easy to grin when your ship comes in and you've got the stock market beat.  But the man worthwhile is the man who can smile when his shorts aren't too tight in the seat.  That was a wonderful moment yesterday.  Okay, Pookie.  And then Pookie, Chris, in the boat. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, of course.  Uh, Anthony, uh, you know, of course everyone knows about Ted Kennedy having that seizure.  Uh-huh, yeah.  We have audio.  Uh, people in the room knew there was a problem when the waiter went up to Ted Kennedy,  asked him what he would like for lunch.  And this is what he got from, uh, the senator.  It's easy to say that it was a problem.  Oh, my God.  That was the first clue that something was drastically wrong yesterday at that luncheon.  What?  Our microphones were everywhere.  What's wrong with you? 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I thought it was weird, um, when the, uh, Lincoln Bible was, uh, handed over, uh, to, um, Mrs. Obama  to hold it while Barack, uh, took the oath.  It was some weird sound, and I, I try to isolate it.  Okay.  More audio from Senator Ted Kennedy. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, really?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  See that, too?  Yeah.  And, uh, I don't know.  Some people at the luncheon didn't even seem to care that, uh, Ted was having a problem  because, uh, other things, uh, concern them. 
[01:08:00]  Food, all right?  And then to ask Ted this.  Try the wine.  Yeah.  You know, perhaps he'd had enough.  That was a little too much.  That's not nice, right?  Yeah, that's not nice.  Yeah.  I have one.  Oh, you do?  Oh.  Yeah, I actually...  Robert Kelly, sure.  Well, uh, Ted Kennedy was, um, on the floor seizing, uh, the Obama kids were doing this.  Thank you. 
[01:08:30]  All right.  You really don't have a...  And then the crowd went like this.  Wow.  Thank you, Robert Kelly, for stopping the bit that we had going.  Just takes one.  Those are my...  Oh, well.  Moving on.  Wait, I have one more.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  When Obama, Ms. Obama held the, uh, Lincoln Bible, this is what I heard. 
[01:09:00]  Are you insinuating he was stealing it?  Uh-huh.  Thank you, Robert Kelly.  Back to the poem.  The poet.  Yes, that was rhyming and, and, uh, I don't know.  And in the joy of a new beginning, we ask you to help us work for that day when black  will not be asked to get back.  Uh-huh.  When brown can stick around.  Uh-huh.  When yellow will be mellow. 
[01:09:30]  Uh-huh.  When the red man can get ahead, man.  Uh-huh.  And when white will embrace what is right.  Let all those...  Wow.  See?  Thanks.  This is where I'm on the same page as Anthony.  It was all fun and games until whitey gets hurt.  Right.  Again.  Right.  White embrace what's right?  How about voting in your guy, dummy?  How about white voting in your guy?  If it was just black people, it would... 
[01:10:00]  If every black person voted, he'd have 10% of the popular vote.  How about that?  And he's a chicken ass because I'm sure he wanted to say, and white is just not right.  Yeah.  White will embrace what is right.  Let all those who do justice and love mercy say amen.  Amen.  Say amen.  Amen.  And amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  That guy annoyed me.  Too much God, by the way, yesterday. 
[01:10:30]  They always bring God into the whole thing.  Too much God.  Into the inauguration.  Like he's hovering over.  Right.  Like he cares who's elected.  Doesn't care about the rest of the world.  He's just going, yeah, I'll pull for this guy.  Right.  Well, it's just when the sports guys go, I want to thank God for this victory.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, guess what?  There were God guys on the other side that was hoping for the big win, too.  God bless America.  Do you think, you know, God, when he made the planet, he already had the borders divvied 
[01:11:00]  up and knew there was going to be an America?  That just shows that we are pompous.  God just, like, created this.  Yeah.  And then we made it.  No, it's really about this little piece of this.  We put the borders in, and he's supposed to look down and go, yeah, God bless that.  That little thing.  That little piece of it.  Yeah, I'll ignore everything else I created.  Yeah, yeah.  That's right.  You're more important.  Yeah.  He's just looking like a child playing with toys.  Very good.  You made an America.  That's so cute.  Yes, I'll bless it.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:11:30]  Well, I made the universe.  He means it.  No.  Daily Show had a problem with that poem, too.  Really?  They just rushed this in.  I didn't get to see Jon Stewart and the gang yesterday, unfortunately.  Jon Stewart's pretty much a lib.  Oh, yeah.  And what kind of problem could he have?  I don't have a problem with it because it keeps it fun.  I'm all about keeping it fun with your thoughts.  If the right could get a guy like this, I would listen to that, too.  The right's got to keep it right. 
[01:12:00]  Right.  Right?  Right.  Sure.  Yeah.  More audio of Ted Kennedy.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  All right.  I guess you get the point.  He had a problem yesterday.  All right.  Here's The Daily Show.  The most adorable civil rights legend I've ever seen.  You try it.  We ask you to help us work for that day when black will not be asked to get back. 
[01:12:30]  When brown can stick around.  When yellow will be mellow.  When the red band can get ahead, man.  When, when, now hold on, hold on.  When blue will be allowed in, too.  When puce will be set loose.  When we rise above the minutiae of fuchsia. 
[01:13:00]  And orange.  Screw orange.  Anthony, I don't do this often.  Yeah.  I'm going to pat myself on the back.  Yeah.  For the whole show.  Oh.  We did a much better job with that guy's crazy poem than The Daily Show did.  I thought he got, did he even play the end part?  With the white?  He didn't even play the white part.  Oh, that's.  Ah, you goddamn liberal. 
[01:13:30]  See, Jon Stewart, I like it.  I like The Daily Show.  It's funny.  I like the Colbert Report.  Uh-huh.  That's funny.  But, like, Jon Stewart won't just call the guy out.  Play the whole clip and call him out.  Do something.  Well, he probably agrees that, you know, white's just not right.  White ain't right.  Because that's what that guy really wanted to say.  Yeah.  Mars.  Give me a communique.  Because I see the coverage of the balls.  And Mars, he wrote me, he goes, did anyone else notice how they already tried to set up the brother? 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  He must have had a hell of a time containing himself during the inaugural ball because of all those fat asses on stage last night.  Yeah, Obama comes out and the stage is filled with black women with the nice big ass.  The booty.  That a lot of the brothers like.  So he walks out and there in front of him is J-Lo's ass, Shakira's ass, Beyonce's ass, Alicia Keys and her ass, Mariah Carey and her big bootie, Mary J. Blige. 
[01:14:30]  She's not a looker.  She's got a good voice, though.  So that's a very good observation from Mars.  Wow, just trying to see if the guy would, like, lose it, if his perv switch would go off right after the inauguration.  Yeah.  I need that.  Yeah, people, you know, Steve from Bayshore. 
[01:15:00]  Michelle Obama's mouth is as wide as her big ass.  I left a word out and stuff, but there's something with her mouth.  Yeah, it really bothers you, huh?  And somebody finally pointed it out.  When she does that smiley thing and not showing her teeth, she'll smile and show her teeth.  Then she does this thing where she pulls her lips in and smiles and she looks just like the Grinch.  When the Grinch smiles and it curled around and around, she has Grinch mouth. 
[01:15:30]  I would love to see a little split from that.  Oh, please.  Yeah.  She has the same mouth as William Dafoe.  Does she?  Yeah, she can't shut that one.  Her teeth is so big, she can't shut her mouth.  Yeah, she can't shut her mouth, but when she shuts it, she does this little pursed lip thing.  It really does bother me.  Hey, you notice them getting out of the limo and the Secret Service going, oh, my God, what are they doing?  Jesse Jackson was live on CNN, and I wanted to come in here and trash him because Obama gets out of the limo way earlier than he was supposed to. 
[01:16:00]  So Jesse Jackson was live on CNN, and you could hear his heart stop, and he stopped breathing.  And they even had acknowledged, I don't know if we have audio, but somebody, I think it had to be Wolf Blitzer because, of course, it was the Situation Room, and it looked like there was a situation going on.  Kind of commented, Jesse, you look a little nervous.  And then I went, oh, yeah, that's right.  He was there one other time. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  So, all right, I'll give him a, I got to give it to him a little bit today.  Jesse's.  Why he might be a little nervous.  Jesse saw something happen once.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But those guys were on high alert yesterday, huh?  Wow, the Secret Service are just amazing to watch.  They are fixated like lunatics.  They got that thousand-yard stare.  They're just walking when Obama was walking down the street, and the Secret Service have them flanked in front of them, behind them. 
[01:17:00]  They are looking at that crowd.  They are not paying attention to anything that is entertaining, any distractions.  They are just looking for people that want to do that man harm.  Right.  Period.  How do they train those guys for that?  Because as humans, we're all ridiculously distracted.  Yeah.  All the time.  We all have ADD.  I don't care who you are.  You see their face, their eyes.  They didn't make a smile, a smirk, nothing. 
[01:17:30]  They just walk alongside.  You know how they learn?  By mistake.  Trial and error is how they train on that job.  And they figure out what you do next so that doesn't happen again.  Yeah.  If I was a Secret Service guy.  Mr. Obama, Mr. Obama.  Right.  You hear that?  Right.  Get him on the ground.  If I was a Secret Service guy, if a kid had like a bouncy red ball in the audience and was just throwing it up in the air, I'd be fixated.  Just fixated.  Oh, look at that.  What happened?  I see a balloon. 
[01:18:00]  Right.  But those guys.  Would you consider them purple or blue?  Just focus.  Just focus.  Is he a cigarette tinfoil?  Yeah.  Yeah, just kind of making a shiny thing in someone's eye.  No, they look badass.  There was one guy with the shaved head and everything.  And Mr. Obama's got a little color in the Secret Service.  I don't think I've ever seen that before.  Yeah.  But, you know, he's playing it like perfectly.  He's got a couple of colored guys.  Very diverse.  Guys of color.  Color guys.  Guys of color.  Jesus.  My grandfather.  Hope he just set the Civil Rights Movement back in another few years. 
[01:18:30]  Well, one day in and he's back.  A couple of colors.  He's like, you are president.  Roll the dice again.  Go back, Ken Spaces.  You are Negro now.  Yeah.  Color guys.  Of course, the guys of color.  It comes out.  Anthony's not the racist.  And then he's got a couple of white guys.  He's got it balanced.  Yeah.  He's looking to have that diversity.  There's never, like, an American Indian Secret Service guy.  No.  No.  What are you saying?  But, like, stereotypical?  With a long ponytail and a feather in his hair and a tear coming down his eyes. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, of course.  All right.  Yeah.  They looked very serious.  And that car.  The beast.  That was a hell of an ad for Caddy.  Yeah.  Here.  See, they're showing it on the...  When are you getting one?  CNN.  Oh, one of those?  Wouldn't that be great?  Just drive around in there.  Try to jack me.  If Van could, he would get one of those.  Of course.  If I was Cadillac, I would offer that up. 
[01:19:30]  For a civilian model?  People would buy it.  And you said it yesterday.  The car just looked heavy and thick.  Oh, my God.  I think it can only hit, what, 60?  65.  That's it.  65.  It's got solid tires.  It's not made to drive fast, I guess, unless they've got to get away from a situation.  Then you don't mind, like, it must have some suspension on it because it's got, like, solid rubber tires.  Yeah.  If the tires are blown out, it's going to be just fine.  It's still going.  We went over the specs the other day.  The glass is, like, five inches thick, the glass. 
[01:20:00]  When they opened the doors, did you see how big they were?  The doors are seven inches of steel.  Big, thick doors.  It weighs 30,000 pounds.  Yeah.  But he did get rims.  He did put nice rims on there.  There were nice rims on there.  He's got 22s.  Were those 22s?  They're really nice.  He did a little pimp my ride.  Yeah.  There was a little pimping going on.  Just a little bit.  Just a little bit.  And then, apparently, the car that follows him has some armament and some guns in it.  It used to be good for the guys to just have, you know, the little machine pistols under 
[01:20:30]  their coat.  You'd see that be pulled out every so often in a crisis like when Reagan was shot.  But this one has a Vulcan cannon.  What?  It's a Vulcan cannon.  What's a Vulcan cannon?  It fires so many rounds per second.  How many is it?  I was reading about it yesterday.  It's 4,000 rounds per minute.  Per minute.  Per minute?  Wow.  That's just a wall.  Here's what a Vulcan cannon sounds like. 
[01:21:00]  For real.  And this isn't one of the bits of a sound, but here's what it sounds like.  Could you imagine?  That is just bullets.  You think that would do damage?  Flying out.  Sounds like me with a chick.  That could do a little bit of damage if somebody's stepping up to the vehicle for an autograph.  I've heard that with a couple chicks.  That wasn't me.  Was that you?  Even better.  Could you play that sound for me again?  Oh, yeah.  I've heard that before.  I wish my tongue sounded like that. 
[01:21:30]  For her pleasure.  For her pleasure.  The bumps are for her pleasure.  There was something else.  I would not want to be a Secret Service guy now.  Well, that's why they really...  Oh, look at the bullets flying through that.  We've got a little video of one of those Vulcan cannons.  Have you ever seen...  Oh, Jesus.  It's just ridiculous what it does.  It's just chewing a building apart.  Look at some guy accidentally...  A house attacks the man. 
[01:22:00]  I can't wait until the guy accidentally shoots into a crowd.  Six-barreled, pneumatically charged, and it's air-cooled.  Six barrels firing 4,000 bullets a minute.  Unbelievable.  That's like...  What's his name?  In Predator.  Carrying around the helicopter machine.  Little Wayne just got one of those, too.  Ah, nice.  Oh, really?  Did he?  Yeah, he's got one.  Get the cat. 
[01:22:30]  Hey, Oprah was in the crowd yesterday.  And this is for real.  Oprah was in the crowd yesterday.  Oh, Jesus.  Da-da-ba-ba-ba-neet.  You know, props to CNN.  That technology...  Yeah, they're getting it from aliens, I believe.  I still can't figure out how they did it.  But basically, CNN said before the inauguration,  if you're going to be anywhere in the area,  and you take a picture,  they said, of the moment,  meaning when Obama raised that hand,  just starts snapping away.  And there was some kind of...  Was there some kind of reference point  that this is all based on? 
[01:23:00]  No, it was...  They put the word out  that if you're snapping pictures,  snap one the second Obama puts his hand up  to take the oath of office,  and then send it to us.  You know, email it.  So they emailed...  A bunch of people emailed.  They emailed 11,000 pictures.  To CNN.  Who then used a program  to put all these pictures together  to get this sweeping,  almost three-dimensional view  of the entire area. 
[01:23:30]  You were able to zoom in.  Zoom out.  Zoom out.  Just based on all the pictures  that were sent in by people that were there.  Really amazing technology.  All sorts of vantage points.  They had the huge screen monitor  that they were able to move things around,  touch screen,  and just flick stuff off the screen.  It was like the future.  Sure.  It's like computers were supposed to be  in the future.  That was wild.  And what scares me about that stuff,  the government or whoever  is really running us,  finally decide,  okay, 
[01:24:00]  we'll let them have this technology.  You know they've had this technology  for a really long time.  But it makes it look like a 3D environment.  And they were showing like,  here's Obama being sworn in.  Now if we sweep over here,  this is where Steven Spielberg  was sitting on the left.  Let's zoom into Steven Spielberg.  And as you see,  other celebrities are in this area as well.  Now let's zoom all the way out  to this side of just amazing technology.  It really is.  It's called The Moment on CNN  under the politics section, I guess.  But wow.  Impressive. 
[01:24:30]  This is what Oprah said,  I think, yesterday.  I'm layered.  I'm layered.  I've got on something called  men's pantyholes.  She's wearing men's pantyholes.  She's layered, all right.  Yes, yes.  Skin and then a bunch of blubber.  Yeah, Japanese whaling  tried to kill her yesterday.  I can make fat jokes now.  Yeah, it's nice, right, Bobby?  It feels good, right?  Fun on this end.  It is fun on this end.  Without your eyes lighting up  if I make a fat joke. 
[01:25:00]  All right, listen,  the phones are lit.  877-212-0NA.  We'll go to you guys next  to get your observations  of the whole thing.  And we're pretty much  focusing on this today,  but there is a good story  coming out of Wisconsin.  The mayor.  Oh, yeah.  Another perv switch going off, man.  Oh, dear.  And just ruining everything.  Yep.  We'll explain next.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Robert Kelly.  We're going to talk more  about the Obama thing.  We're going to take a quick break.  We're going to do some  off-roading right now.  We'll get back on the highway  in a second. 
[01:25:30]  Off-roading.  We've got to talk about  this thing.  This thing.  This freak.  Well, I'm not saying freaks.  One freak.  This is something that,  by the way,  you and I started talking about  in Boston.  There's an update  on the two-headed thing.  They were mere children  at the time.  Now,  it,  they,  I don't even know  what to call it  because it's,  it's a two-headed woman. 
[01:26:00]  They're the greatest  Siamese twins ever  because they share  a complete body  and the only thing  that's different  is they've got two heads  and the upper part  of their body  looks kind of like  Michael Phelps.  Yeah,  their shoulders  are very wide.  Very wide.  Like,  they could be really good  in a pool.  But they only have  one set of breasts.  You know,  normal two,  two breasts.  But,  you know.  Can we get the picture  up on onaradio.com?  Because we have an update  on these two.  One of them's engaged, 
[01:26:30]  you're telling me?  One has just gotten engaged.  He's the luckiest guy  on the planet Earth.  I was telling Anthony  as he's,  as he's telling me this,  when we get outside  this studio,  there is a world out there  I just don't understand  whatsoever.  Like,  I can't even wrap my arms  around what you just said  that the two-headed thing,  one of the heads  is engaged.  Yeah.  And what is the other head  supposed to do?  Exactly.  That's the questions  that don't ever get answered  with these things.  And for the people  through XM,  we'd have a bunch of stuff  to say.  Oh,  well, 
[01:27:00]  and we will,  too.  For the people out there  that don't know  about these two,  both heads,  it's not like one of the head  is just flopped over  and does nothing.  They're two heads  that think differently.  Two distinctly different people.  They're two bodies.  It's not like the country singer  where he has to carry  that aggravating,  awful singer around  with her all the time.  Look,  don't get us started  on that one.  That's one of our  favorite stories ever.  Oh,  it's my favorite.  This is the gurney,  the gurney,  the gurney.  He has to walk around  in a high office chair 
[01:27:30]  around the city.  So the other one can live.  Man,  I would chop that thing  off in a second.  Go ahead,  Anthony.  They share some organs  below the waist,  intestines,  vagina,  uterus,  bladder.  They only have one  of all these.  Do they have two hearts?  Yes.  They do.  It starts getting  a little dodgy  up by the kidneys. 
[01:28:00]  They have one right kidney  and two left kidneys.  One small intestine  and one large intestine.  Why are they being  so selfish?  Why don't you give  one of those up  for somebody that needs it?  Two stomachs,  two gallbladders,  one liver,  two hearts,  three lungs.  That's interesting.  And one rib cage.  That's kind of extended  around the whole thing.  What about below  the belly button? 
[01:28:30]  Below the belly button  is all that single stuff.  Aside from the two kidneys  on the left side,  which is, you know,  kind of down there  but in the back.  One pelvis,  one pair of ovaries,  one uterus,  one bladder,  one vagina,  one urethra.  And six buttholes.  Two hands.  Jesus Christ, Bobby.  Can you say that?  No.  Oh, sorry.  I don't know.  And they got two boobies.  Yeah.  They got two arms  and two legs.  Yeah.  Who works the right arm 
[01:29:00]  and who works the left?  How does that work?  I want to know  everything about them  just so I can know  how sex works.  I don't care about  anything else.  You're so right.  I don't care about  anything else  because they have,  here's what they have,  they have separate  driver's license.  Now that to me is like,  That's just stupid.  What if,  no but,  what if one's asleep  and the other one's driving?  Right.  Like,  you're still controlling  both legs? 
[01:29:30]  Right.  Can both of them  control the legs  independently  or does one control  the right leg  and one control the left?  But they have two  separate brains.  It's like driving school.  So I think they both control.  You have pedals  on both sides  so the other guy  can just put the brakes  on when you're messing up.  It's the oddest thing.  They have two brains  that merge  into one spinal cord  that then,  you know,  it's like the legs.  you know,  the more I look at these two  and I haven't seen them  in years,  the one girl  really,  it's really her body 
[01:30:00]  and the other one  is just getting in the way.  She's butting in.  Look at that.  This girl could so live  without her sister  to...  It's like her head's  growing out of the  side of her neck  a little bit more  than the other one.  It's obvious to me  that...  Huh?  They're not that bad looking.  For two-headed broad.  For two-headed broad,  it's...  I mean,  they're not that bad looking.  I've actually done  one-headed girls  who are worse.  Are those the same girls,  Danny?  Yeah.  They're not that bad. 
[01:30:30]  But the sex thing.  Sex thing.  Now,  one of them got engaged.  Brittany.  Why even name them differently?  Why would you call them Brittany?  Brittany one and Brittany two.  I would call them Monster  and...  Left and right.  Brittany and Abby.  Yeah,  left monster and right monster.  Brittany and Abby.  I should have thought about it  a little more  before I brought it  to a million people.  Twin it.  Brittany's engaged.  Abby is not engaged.  Okay.  They have separate 
[01:31:00]  driver's license,  favorite foods,  distinct personalities  and so forth.  Okay.  What about sex?  Yeah,  the office did a little  something with Steve Carell  for you office people  out there  where he has...  Sex is the question  on everyone's mind.  Sex would be the best.  It's not like one can leave  while the other's having sex.  We'll both enjoy sex together.  If they can have children,  whose child would it be?  It's just one of those  weird situations.  Now,  I'm looking and thinking 
[01:31:30]  if the engaged one  is pleasuring  her husband  in a certain way  where she wouldn't be able  to whistle a happy tune  at the same time,  a certain part of that guy  is definitely interfering  with the other girl's ability  to speak too.  She'd sound like...  This is what I want to know.  How do you deal with that?  And then, 
[01:32:00]  is she also feeling  the pleasure of sex  that the other one is  and then isn't that  kind of a threesome?  Imagine the guy.  You got moaning going on  from the other head.  You're actually...  You're doing incest  when you pleasure yourself  because you're actually  pleasuring your sister.  What if...  What if, like,  the one that's engaged  wants to have the sex  but the other one doesn't?  Right.  Is that a rape thing?  Yeah.  Got to throw that  at a lawyer  and really watch him 
[01:32:30]  just, like,  watch the crane explode.  What happens  if one's a prude  and one's a slut?  You know?  She's like,  oh, I'm going out tonight.  I am just gonna  hit a bar and...  Hit a hole.  Yeah.  And then, you know,  she's taking different guys home.  Maybe guys that want  to do things  that are painful  and the other girl  isn't into that at all.  How does this work?  I need to know.  I need to know all this.  How about if they both  have boyfriends 
[01:33:00]  and then...  Dude.  I mean,  what are you gonna watch?  Another guy do your...  Have sex with your girl?  Robert now got...  That's another one.  That is effed up.  So, all right,  let's say the one gets married  and then the other one.  I marry head one  and you marry head two.  Well, yeah,  and also I'm like,  well, I like head two  so now I want...  So you like what?  What?  What?  No, number two, right.  Head number two.  Wait, sir.  XM, okay.  You have head number one.  I like head number two  and I want to show my like  for head number two. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  How are you not getting jealous?  Yeah.  How do you...  Because you like head number one  and now I'm...  Yeah, you're with...  Basically having sex  with your woman.  Right.  Yeah, definitely.  And it's not...  Resting things on my woman's cheek.  You've got to have an open mind  if you're dating these monsters.  They're monsters.  Yeah, and then you get into  the whole thing where you guys  are sharing the same anatomy.  Like you're sharing her anatomy  amongst yourselves. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  I guess to keep it separate,  if like, all right,  Bobby marries head number one,  I marry head number two,  we make an agreement.  Look, you stay away from the back door.  That's mine.  Right.  You get the front door.  But then you've got to eventually...  Yeah, but you've got to go  for the front door.  And then if you went  for the front door  in the afternoon  and I come home  and I want to kiss the front door,  now I'm kissing you.  We'll do odd and even days.  Yeah, but you've got to clean.  Even days I get the back door.  Odd days you get the back door.  It'd be actually good  if like, you know,  when a movie first comes out 
[01:34:30]  and the theater's always packed,  you know, you just...  And you want to go on a double date,  you just stick her right in the middle.  You would...  Yeah, they still buy two tickets.  They buy two tickets.  They have to buy two...  Yep.  Really?  The weird part is  if you can't just go look at me.  They apparently don't.  Sit behind that thing?  Could you move your head?  The other one?  The other one.  I hope they start following me on Twitter  because then I get four eyeballs.  Oh, four eyeballs.  For the price of one.  Each one controls their side of the body 
[01:35:00]  so that you would control...  Right monster would control  the right arm and the right leg.  Oh, really?  So you guys would have issues with that.  A walking would be a problem.  So if you were married to right monster  and Opie, you were married to left monster,  the right hand wouldn't be allowed to touch you  because then it would be cheating, I guess.  A lot of questions coming in.  Jack from Florida,  what if one of them kills somebody?  Now you have to go to jail because...  That is a real interesting thing  because then, yeah, you're being...  You know what I would do?  I would just put the one that killed the person  in like a birdcage. 
[01:35:30]  Their head is in a bird...  You just have to walk around in a birdcage.  ...for their sins.  How else are you going to do that?  You're in jail.  She was a bad girl.  She's got to wear that birdcage 8 to 20.  You can't in this country put someone in prison  if they didn't commit a crime.  So if monster one kills somebody,  you can't put her in prison.  That would...  Wow, that's what I would test. 
[01:36:00]  They could kill with impunity.  If I had, like, another head on my body,  that's what I would test.  I would just start killing people.  Test the law.  What are you going to do?  You could just kill somebody and go,  you can't put me in jail.  That's right.  And they can't be split up.  What if it's capital murder or something like that?  They got to do the death penalty.  How do you do that one?  Can't kill an innocent person?  Could they just lop off one of her heads  and the rest of the body lives?  No.  Or just half of her body's paralyzed?  Can't do that.  You can't just lop off her head?  Wow, that does bring up some legal issues.  They cut off an arm.  They were born with a kind of a useless middle arm 
[01:36:30]  that was chopped off at birth.  Yeah, where was that growing at?  Why would that be useless?  I think it's right in the middle.  That'd be perfect.  Just jiggle these, please.  Use that.  I just saw a picture there holding up.  Put that in here, jiggle these,  and then touch this.  And then both of you swallow that.  And write out the bills at the same time.  Write some checks.  I've got to be honest with you.  I wouldn't be as loving as their parents were.  I would just have to kill it.  No, you wouldn't.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:37:00]  If you and Lindsay had two-headed babies.  I ain't going through life with a two-headed thing.  Why?  Hell no.  What a great radio that would be.  Think of all the other radio jocks  that would just goof on you.  F that, Bobby.  Come on.  It'd be good-looking.  A good-looking two-headed monster.  That's wonderful.  I'm not, no, no monsters.  I'd take it.  Before you killed it, I'd take it.  I ain't giving it to anybody either.  Why?  Just give it away.  I don't know. 
[01:37:30]  That'd be fantastic having a two-headed baby.  I want to know all about the sex thing with these girls.  Yeah.  I want to know how they work, then.  Yeah, but how do you have a private moment?  How do you have, like,  if one's a deviant and one's not,  how do you have a private moment  when you're in the tub?  Yeah.  You know, and how do you,  hey, what do you go,  what do you, hey, listen,  can you give me a sec?  And then they both get married.  Now, what about things like, you know,  honeymoon, vacations, going away. 
[01:38:00]  You've got to carry both of those heads through a door.  The two guys got to be together all the time  with these, that thing.  Do they get two times of the month?  No, they only have one pair of ovaries.  One, but you get two girls bitching.  Yeah, they probably both just, like,  wah, wah, wah, wah.  Wow.  The one definitely looks like she doesn't belong on the body.  I'd be really mad if I was that.  The other one's intruding.  Right.  I'd be really mad if I was the other one, 
[01:38:30]  because this looks like a very easy fix  if they weren't loving parents.  Imagine pulling them over.  Imagine being a cop and pulling them over.  They both hand you their license.  That's another thing.  If they're drunk,  they have two separate stomachs  and two separate hearts,  so do they have two different circulatory systems?  Because then one would get drunk if she drank,  but the other one wouldn't.  I forgot about these monsters.  We haven't talked about them in a while. 
[01:39:00]  I need to know everything.  Steven S. from Bayshore, of course.  Steven S. writes,  two girls, one clump.  Yeah, and I'm with Kevin from Connecticut.  At least one of them isn't being carried around  on that giant office chair  and wants to be a country singer.  Yeah, that mess.  Did they go to college, these two girls?  They just graduated high school last year  and are off to college in Minnesota now.  Minnesota.  What if one drops out?  Yeah.  I've got to go every day anyway. 
[01:39:30]  Ah!  God, I've got to go.  I dropped out.  Why am I here?  How about Mongo the trucker?  Mongo.  Hey, if monster number one threatens suicide,  is that considered a hostage situation?  That's true.  I've got to talk the one head down.  Oh, my God.  The one has a knife in her.  No.  Ready to slit her wrist.  The other one's fighting her.  Or even something not as drastic, 
[01:40:00]  just like a fight, a fist fight.  They're just stuck punching each other in the face  over and over again.  So one knocks one out,  and your leg, you fall over,  because that leg goes to sleep.  You knock her out,  and your arm and leg falls asleep,  and you topple over.  Why are they in a dress?  Oh, man.  Why are they in a dress?  They can't wear anything else.  It's sexy.  They can't wear a hoodie.  Why are they in a dress?  Just one hood between their necks. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, my God.  They can't wear a hoodie.  It's just a pocket.  Look up.  Oh, man.  That is really...  It's too many questions and not enough answers.  They have video of them, though, right, speaking?  Do they?  Oh, yeah.  They're like...  I hate to say it.  They're well-adjusted.  Really?  They don't know any better.  They were on the Learning Channel.  They did, like, a documentary on them.  Which is the Freak Channel.  That's the Freak Show Channel, 
[01:41:00]  but they make believe we're learning something  and we're looking at these monsters.  We're learning what appreciation we have  for sick, twisted stuff on this planet.  I remember...  That's all I'm learning when I watch them.  I remember when they were little,  they had video of them riding a bike together,  jumping in a pool together.  How hard would it be right now in that interview  if they just started making out?  It would be easy for them, wouldn't it?  Yeah.  Look at their...  Look at that seat.  They got a vest with the zipper way down.  The clothing has to be custom-made.  Oh, and they got a brother.  A couple of brothers.  A couple of brothers that can just walk around  and say, ha-ha. 
[01:41:30]  A confused dog.  Got a one-headed dog.  Even the dog laughs.  And a mother with a friggin' DNA problem.  Mother with a radioactive womb.  Hey, this is a good point.  Let's go to Mike in East Northport.  Mikey?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  What's this?  Mike?  Hey, it's H-O-V-Lane, baby.  Everywhere we go, we go.  Yeah, that's two people.  Wow, they have...  Oh, jeez.  The one likes her hair short.  The other one likes her long. 
[01:42:00]  That's wonderful.  Got to be an individual, right?  They are so in each other's way.  All the time.  They're talking, and their cheeks are just hitting.  Man, that's...  They're bumping heads.  What is that, a little sister?  It gets to laugh.  Please tell me that's their little sister  that looks perfect.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Look at them driving.  The other one's hanging out the window like a dog.  Oh, the tape turns.  Once, they each got a hand on the wheel.  Oh, my God.  I'm amazed, but I can't...  This could be the greatest video ever. 
[01:42:30]  I know it's radio.  Dude, I can't get my eyes off of it.  They're driving.  Is this on the Learning Channel?  How do they walk?  It's TLC.  The video we're watching is just amazing.  What happened?  Mike?  The other one's Danny.  Oh, Danny, I'm sorry.  If anybody wants to check it out, it's called Joined for Life, and it aired on TLC.  When?  Because I'm a big fan of the TLC.  Not sure, but they definitely are the free channel.  I was watching something last week.  It was three hour-long specials in a row about just morbidly obese people.  It was like, I'm an 800-pound man, I'm an 800-pound woman, and then I'm an 800-pound 
[01:43:00]  teenager.  I saw that, too.  Thanks for ruining a good joke I would have had, Bob Kelly.  Oh, as soon as he said it, I didn't even have to look up.  Yeah.  I didn't even notice.  I just kept my head down.  I was chomping at the bit.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  I would have done a good fat Bob Kelly joke a year ago, and now...  Something like Bob Kelly's Comedy Central special was on?  Yeah.  Something like that, of course.  I thought it wouldn't do.  That's very good.  Remember fat Bob Kelly?  Wasn't he a douche? 
[01:43:30]  You just made fun of him.  Yeah.  That was just a...  Oh, God.  Dude, they got him now in the doctor's office getting their physical.  Uh-oh.  And the doctor actually humored them by getting both of their heights.  Are you kidding me?  I swear to God.  I swear to God.  Both of their heights.  And Alex in Boston, we're going to exhaust this for a few more minutes.  Alex, what do you got on this?  Oh, my God.  Fat ass, kind of.  I just thought of this.  Two mouths, two stomachs, but one ass. 
[01:44:00]  How messy must that be?  Well, everything goes into one set of...  Everything from the two stomachs goes into one set of intestines.  Yeah.  So at some point, it joins together.  Yeah.  So they must have to go to the bathroom twice as much.  By the way...  Right?  What's that?  Danny looks puzzled.  I don't know.  I'm thinking that maybe because, I mean, if one eats and, I mean, they're getting nutrition  and that nutrition is then flowing throughout their one body. 
[01:44:30]  So I'm thinking they probably eat just as much as one person would because I'm thinking  that the other one probably doesn't get hungry if the other one's eating.  They have separate stomachs.  They have separate stomachs and separate circulatory systems.  So these two are crapping all the time.  They must be.  Puddle of AIDS, a question we like to ask on the show a lot, Anthony.  Opie, would you?  In a second.  Oh, you got to.  I think my wife would even understand.  You got to have this opportunity.  I would cheat on my wife for these two. 
[01:45:00]  You would have to.  God bless.  I just hold one of their faces and mush it while I'm making out with the other one.  Shut your face.  I want to clunk their heads together because they can't get away.  They are the weirdest looking thing.  They're kind of sexy, though.  I mean, except for that hump in the back.  It looks like they have a ham in the middle of their back.  Yeah, yeah.  The back is real wide.  Yeah.  The back is really wide. 
[01:45:30]  It's got to support the two heads.  But the bottom half looks pretty normal, like, you know, the part you're going to use.  You can tell they have, like, a coordination thing going when they walk because one's controlling  one leg and one's controlling the other.  Yeah.  So they're walking.  Or maybe she's just got to go to the bathroom again.  Who are they at therapy?  That's the mother?  Why is she showing her face on camera?  Go back to Chernobyl.  Yeah, you gave birth to monsters.  How do they know who got knocked up?  That's another great question coming in. 
[01:46:00]  I guess you'd have to decide.  They'd probably decide which ovary dropped the egg.  If it's the left one, it belongs to the left head.  If it's the right one, it belongs to the right head.  All right.  Hey, uh...  Or they just do even odds.  Once I see...  Shoot.  Rock paper.  Oh.  Susan in Jersey.  Susan.  Yes.  Hello, Susan.  Hello?  Yes, you're on the air with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[01:46:30]  You grew up with Siamese twins?  Maybe I need to leave a little bit.  All right.  What do you got?  I was just wondering if you guys feel as evil as you sound.  Oh, boy.  Oh, you're one of these people?  Oh, no.  What's the matter?  A little rough.  What's the matter?  To call them monsters?  They're monsters.  Yes, they're monsters!  In a movie.  What would you have the mother do?  Kill them?  Well...  All right.  That's her choice.  Yeah, throw them in a pit like a Spartan.  Yeah. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, in Spartan, they never would have survived.  I want to fight with you.  You can't lift your shield up.  It's my father's shield.  You've got to protect the person to your left, and it's you.  We live in a society where women use abortion as birth control.  Yeah.  Most women would not give birth to this.  Just split her like a piece of wood.  Oh, she hung up.  Of course she did.  Do you realize how evil you sound?  No.  This is not evil.  This is... 
[01:47:30]  This is...  What am I looking for?  This is...  We're handling it like it should be handled.  A freak show.  Can one get half of, like, pot belly if she eats a lot?  And the other one doesn't, like...  There's too many questions.  What if one girl wants...  There aren't answers.  What if one girl wants, you know, a boob job?  And the other girl goes, no effing way.  Did they get one boob?  Then they start looking like those houses in Queens.  It's the duplex houses.  Right.  Where they put the shingles on that are a different color than the other part of the house. 
[01:48:00]  What if one's a racist and one loves black guys?  Ah.  That's called the Opie and Anthony show.  Well, or just, you know, such guys.  Yeah.  Look at that one.  God bless the parents, though.  They had two other kids after this came out.  God bless the parents.  You have to.  I think not.  You have to.  Satan blessed the parents.  Susan, call back.  Let's have a discussion.  You're pretty much a coward.  You say your little line and then hang up. 
[01:48:30]  I want to hear about her story of growing up with...  Yeah.  As she called them Siamese twins.  Did she say Siamese are conjoined?  Did you write Siamese?  She said Siamese.  See, that's politically incorrect.  They're conjoined twins.  Siamese twins is offensive to the two-headed Americans.  Two-headed and two arms and one heart.  And a half a liver.  Oh, they're playing basketball.  Please tell me they're playing basketball.  They're just showing...  Oh, my God.  That's just unfair.  Look at that.  They're playing basketball.  It's like team ball ball. 
[01:49:00]  All right, look.  I'm a big B-ball fan.  I haven't played my whole life.  Yeah.  Now, you're only allowed four people on the court because this one has two heads?  Yeah.  What happens?  For real?  How does that work?  How disappointed must you be if you're on VAT's basketball team?  Yeah.  Like, you know you're not making it to state or anything.  And them riding a bike.  Come on.  Now, I could see basketball probably wouldn't be a problem, but soccer could be since you  can use your head.  Now, that's too many people on the field. 
[01:49:30]  Just thinking logically.  Let's say hi to...  Just be the goalie because she'd fit in the whole goal.  Oh, yeah.  Big wide shoulders.  Let's say hi to James in New Hampshire.  James.  Hey, morning, boys.  Morning.  Of course, the family guy has touched on this issue.  Yeah.  It was an episode where they discussed Peter's ancestor from the Civil War times where one  fought for the North and one fought for the South.  Okay.  And the guy from...  The one from the North ended up shooting the one from the South, and then they spanned it  10 years later, and he's standing there with a skeleton hanging off him. 
[01:50:00]  He goes, yep.  Didn't think that one through.  Family guy's rules.  That's a good...  Fuck it out.  I'm just amazed that...  You just showed him doing a headstand.  Yeah.  A headstand.  That's easy.  A headstand.  Headstand.  A headstand.  You know, that woman that called, and I really wish she would call back, how are we supposed  to look at this?  Who has...  Who's looking at this like, oh, what a heartwarming story? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  What a heartwarming story.  Yeah.  Right.  We all love to...  Sometimes...  We all love to look at disasters and freak shows and all this crap, and we like to make  believe we don't.  What?  Sometimes we lose our heads.  We...  Why do you think there's so much traffic every day?  Because we're all rubbernecking.  Some dope outl loses a tire, and it's no big deal, and we all are slowing down to look  because we're hoping for more.  That is society.  That is society.  Yeah.  Imagine pulling up on them in a car. 
[01:51:00]  Oh.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, yous.  What are yous doing tonight?  How do they play basketball if one wants to move left and the other moves right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How do they coordinate that crap when they're playing sports?  You know what a great golfer they'd be, though?  They'd be able to keep their eye on the ball and look at the pin.  Did you watch this for me?  Yeah.  Watch this for me.  Yeah.  If you can't keep your head down...  You keep one head, you could just stay down the whole time.  And the other one's looking. 
[01:51:30]  Looking where it's going.  I got it.  I'm sure they would still mess it up.  Do they pay taxes twice?  Another good question.  Well, they will now.  That's for sure.  With Obama in there, they'll probably pay four times.  Imagine the driver, the driving instructor, they're all...  Most of those guys are alcoholics to begin with.  And what do they do?  They're like, okay, it's your turn to drive.  You pass, but let's see what you can do.  You fail.  Right.  Yeah, but one's having a full-fledged conversation with them.  The other one's driving.  They both have to look at the road. 
[01:52:00]  I mean, one controls the left on one.  That's how it works, right?  Yeah, the other one could adjust the radio or talk on a cell phone.  Can one talk on a cell phone while the other drives and you're not going to take it?  Five years later.  You don't have to use a Bluetooth.  You can just use it.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Just amazing.  All questions.  See?  We didn't get one answer.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Once again, I'm trying to get my Twitter account going.  Opie Radio on Twitter. 
[01:52:30]  And Anthony, your Facebook.  Because someone's saying there's a bunch of Anthony Cummins out there.  I'm the only real one.  The picture of me is the one that I took.  It was us on stage at the big CBS event.  Oh, really?  So there's a big CBS, one of the CBS logo eyeballs behind me.  Nice.  That's the real me.  How many eyeballs you got?  Oh, I don't know about eyeballs.  I go with friends.  It's all about getting eyeballs for your stuff on the internet.  I go with friends.  Do you want eyeballs for your...  Do you want a pillow fight later? 
[01:53:00]  Oh, yeah.  I don't accept any of those things.  Can you explain half that stuff after the break?  Yeah, I'll try.  I'm sure Bobby knows.  We'll use leather pillows.  You're an ass.  Obama president, nah!  You can't do that.  Why?  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. 
[01:53:30]  Let me tell you how cool Twitter is, Ant, and then I'll stop.  Yeah.  We were just talking about that video.  Of the two-headed monster.  Of course.  And I sent out the link to all my followers.  How do you do that?  I'm just like, I ain't telling you how to do the cool stuff, Bobby.  Come on.  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  Opie Radio on Twitter.  How do you send it?  And that lady.  You can do that.  You can do that.  You can just like...  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  I probably did it wrong after Bragg and said that.  Like, I want to take a picture of the studio. 
[01:54:00]  Like that.  Take a picture.  You just got shocked, right, Bobby?  Now, Ant, you just took a picture of the studio.  Yeah.  Use photo.  Mm-hmm.  Like that.  Like that.  Upload.  It's got electrified in my ear.  We complained about that a while ago.  We gave up on fixing that problem.  Da, da, da, da, da, da.  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  Uploading to my Facebook.  Don't show Bobby. 
[01:54:30]  Bobby, you know what's weird about you?  You're really good friends with Dane Cook.  And Dane was in early as far as this new media thing goes.  And you didn't learn a thing from him.  First of all, no, stop.  You didn't learn a thing from him.  Would you stop?  Maybe he should give you a few pointers on the Facebook, the MySpace, the Twitter, and everything else.  Can we stop?  First of all, I got Dane into the Internet.  That, Dane got his first website because I had a website first that I made myself. 
[01:55:00]  The picture I just snapped is now up there for the entire world to see.  Where?  How do you do it?  Facebook.  On my Facebook account.  We're not telling you.  Oh, you're on Facebook.  I know how to do it.  I'm talking Twitter.  I'm not Twitter.  I hope he's Twitter.  I'm Face.  You're Twitter?  You're Face?  Do you go to Twitter counter?  Twitter and Face.  I'm Space.  That's our new radio names.  Twitter and Face.  Yeah.  Twitter and Face.  Good morning to the Twitter and Face.  Twitter and Face.  Figures I would pick the faggy naming technology.  Twitter.  I'm a Twitter.  Twitter. 
[01:55:30]  Eee.  Twice.  What?  I said twice.  What?  Nothing.  Maybe I wasn't listening.  Maybe it was good.  I don't know.  Hey, Anthony, speaking of the two-headed monster thing.  Yeah.  I wish that lady would call back, because I guess she said that she grew up with Siamese  twins, conjoined twins, blah, blah, blah.  There she is one, and the other one hung up.  Wait, that's the picture you just put up on your Facebook?  Yeah.  You look like a complete idiot?  That's it right there.  You look funny.  And like the pal talk camera's right in the way. 
[01:56:00]  Wow.  If you look in the pal talk camera and the picture you just took that's on your Facebook,  you could see you taking the picture.  You see me naked in there taking the picture like in the teapot on the guy on eBay?  Yeah.  When he's selling that shiny teapot, and he put it down, but he was naked when he took  the picture.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the reflection in it is hysterical.  I'm nude in the pal talk camera.  Where is it?  I heard about this picture.  I've never seen it.  It's so damn funny.  We're the most visual radio show in America.  Look at the guys. 
[01:56:30]  All right.  You got it.  Hey, Ant, but that lady, the old man.  I figured it out.  And she's got to understand something.  In the year 2009, we're just starting to accept the black man.  Well, just starting.  Yeah, yeah.  More or less.  Yesterday could have been the day where a lot more people start accepting the black man.  Maybe not.  Maybe not.  Whatever.  But the point I'm making is give us the two-headed monster thing for a few more decades, please,  before we have to start accepting two-headed monsters in society. 
[01:57:00]  Like two-headed monster?  President?  Imagine in the year 5,082.  Two-headed monster president.  The first two-headed monster president.  All the news would be speculating.  So they have to do two separate oaths of office.  Well, one's a Democrat.  One's a Republican.  They go against each other.  Yeah, yeah.  One loses, but then gets to spend all its time in the Oval Office with the other one.  One has a seizure.  The other one wants to run a marathon.  Can one be president?  One be vice president.  Because then if one dies, the other one's dead, too.  Well, obviously, if there was a two-headed monster president, they would have to change the Constitution. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  The Constitution has to be...  To no two-headed monster presidents ever, ever, ever.  Right, right.  Give us a break.  Ever, ever, never, ever.  Ever, never, ever, ever.  Signed, everyone.  We're being more accepting, but we're not ready for two-headed monsters just walking around everywhere.  Well, you know, back in the day, they would just throw this baby.  They would just kill this baby.  No, they wouldn't.  Well, some would.  Back in the Spartan days. 
[01:58:00]  Dude, if that kid...  There was a time when you had one of these things.  Why would you sell that?  Oh, there's the teapot.  Oh, my God.  How do you...  He's selling a teapot, and he's naked.  And you could see his reflection right in the teapot on purpose.  I would.  That would be so funny to just pop it up there.  Let's all do that.  See how long it's...  We'll all just...  Let's all get shiny teapots and sell them.  I would do that.  I would show my body on the side of a teapot like that, because you can't really see too much going on.  Get a little work, though, first, so you really look impressive. 
[01:58:30]  Work it a little bit.  Yeah, get a little guitar.  Smack it around a little.  A little guitar action.  A little guitar.  Yeah, play the guitar a little bit just to get it going.  You got to get guitar.  You can't get to the point where it's almost diving board.  Yeah, no, you got to...  Once you get diving board, it looks like you're trying.  It's a fine line.  Yeah, fine line.  By the way, Ricky M. from Hollister, Massachusetts.  Did Bobby teach Dane how to manage his money, too?  Oh.  Oh, that's got to hurt.  Whoa.  How's Dane doing?  He's all right.  How's he doing?  Yeah.  How's he doing? 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, how's he doing?  How's he doing?  What can you say about it?  I don't know.  That is a big story.  I don't know, guys.  You know, he lost both his parents in one year.  Everybody accused him of being a hack.  Tried to turn the whole industry on him.  And then his brother took all his money.  I don't know.  How do you think he's doing?  Damn.  Thank God he's just surviving.  He still has enough money, though, right?  What?  No.  Dude.  I don't know, but I don't know.  Tell him I said hi.  Yeah.  He's...  Dude, let me...  I'll write him.  He's working it.  But his brother...  What a nightmare. 
[01:59:30]  God.  What an effing nightmare.  His brother.  I mean...  Your own family.  Or half-brother.  Yeah.  But a half-brother is his family.  What, you know?  No, they were brothers, dude.  They were brothers.  They've lived together.  They, you know, they grew up together.  Not the half-brother.  Yeah, it's...  I mean, you really can't talk about it, because if I talk about it, then I'm going to be summoned  to the court.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  That's the last thing.  I don't even like jury duty.  I don't know.  Yeah, but you did tell us behind the scenes that you know pretty much everything about this.  No.  No, I didn't.  That is a false... 
[02:00:00]  Let me just say something.  That is a false statement.  Let me say it again.  You didn't say...  I know.  I got inside info that would blow your mind.  That wasn't you, Robert Kelly.  That wasn't you, Robert Kelly.  I love that you added that.  That wasn't you?  Dane actually hasn't told me anything to protect me.  And he can't talk about a lot of stuff.  But he's working it out.  Look, I have no problem saying I like Dane.  Yeah.  Cook.  And yes, I'll be one of those guys that say that I think he's very funny.  Absolutely. 
[02:00:30]  It is one of those bitches, though.  I'm not going to be one of those guys jumping on the bandwagon.  I think he's hilarious.  I've seen him three or four times and just been blown away by his stuff and how he does  his stand-up.  Absolutely.  And I saw him at Comedy Connection way back when he was a nobody.  Just killing.  Yeah.  Killing in those rooms.  Yeah.  But occasionally, Satan wants his part of the contract back.  Let me tell you, man.  It's weird, man.  Jesus.  How does that?  I mean, you survive all the stuff you survived in the last year. 
[02:01:00]  And then just to wake up and you're a brother.  Oh, man.  And it's a half-brother?  Yeah.  So different fathers or different mothers?  Different fathers.  Two-headed?  Oh, so it is true that Dane's last name is Cook and his brother's last name was Crook.  Oh, God.  This could be my new bit.  The drone thing on the mic.  No, I can't take credit for that.  That's Kevin from Connecticut.  Why would you give him credit?  Take it.  I don't need to take someone else's line and then make believe I said it. 
[02:01:30]  I'll do it.  I do okay on my own.  Throw me some.  I'm not the funniest man in the room, but I do okay for myself.  I haven't had a good line all day.  Talking about politics.  I know nothing about it, nor do I care.  Wait, there was...  I just want Call of Duty 6 to come out.  That's all I want.  No, Bobby, in the...  Oh, it's going to be great.  In the 7 o'clock...  I'm going to stab you in a corner.  All right, keep the problem.  I was going to give you a compliment.  You're right.  I'm sorry.  In the 7 o'clock hour, you had one.  What was it?  Oh, shoot. 
[02:02:00]  You did not just fall for that.  I have nothing.  Just wanting?  Oh, really?  What was it?  What?  What was it?  Please tell me.  Well, I consider this radio a muscle, and you have to work it.  And when you don't...  Like, you guys come in here every day and work out.  Yeah.  You work out.  You're pumping the iron.  We've got to keep our chops up.  Yeah, you've got to come in.  This is my first workout.  Tomorrow, my legs are going to be sore, and it's going to be hard.  But, you know, you do your best to hang with you guys.  I'm here just to occasionally throw something out. 
[02:02:30]  Shut up, Robert.  Thanks.  You were very good today.  Thank you.  You really were.  Hey, I don't know if he wants this to be mentioned, but, ah, what the hell?  Brother Elmo had a bit of a problem on a plane yesterday.  And I want to...  What?  And I don't really communicate with Brother Elmo these days.  He's not the guy that was upset about the plane not letting the people off fast enough  and opened up the emergency exit.  And jumped out.  Walked out on the wing.  No, he wasn't that guy.  It's like just because you saw it happen in the river and they went through it on the news 
[02:03:00]  on how you opened it up and walked out.  Don't just do it now when you're waiting at the gate.  Yeah.  You will get in trouble.  Some idiot is on a flight.  It pulls up to the terminal.  Everyone's getting off.  And believe me, I've been in this situation where people aren't moving fast enough.  They're never fast enough for me.  I'm the this is how it's done guy.  I grab it.  I'm off.  And then I want to turn around and go, that's how you do it.  That's how you get off the plane quickly.  But people sit there and they take their time.  They can't get the carry on.  They yap in. 
[02:03:30]  They're doing something, whatever.  But I guess this guy got a little peeved.  He was in an emergency row.  So he popped that door open and jumped out on the wing.  And by the time he was on the tarmac, the police officers were going to greet him.  Dude, I was on a plane.  It was an international flight.  Some old guy, really old, went to use the bathroom and went over to the door of the plane.  And all you heard was, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:04:00]  And around six people just grabbed this old guy.  And the whole time he's smiling.  He had no idea what he was doing.  Oh.  I know you can't open.  Yeah, they won't open.  Okay.  Thank you.  Because that's what I was about to ask.  But the thought of the pressure just sucking him out and him wondering for that split second,  what just happened?  You dummy.  I guess you'll have to just call me to find out what happened to my brother.  No, I was just going to turn now and say, what happened to your brother?  There we go.  My brother, Elmo, he's got diabetes. 
[02:04:30]  I think he has openly talked about it on the show.  All right, I'm safe.  So he's flying somewhere.  I don't know where because it's winter and he just keeps to himself until spring.  He's one of those guys.  He's a bear.  He feels a lot of darkness during the winter.  Yeah.  I do, too.  I'm not a big fan of that.  Really?  Yes, I was depressed.  Dude, I get paralyzed.  Yesterday, I was paralyzed.  I couldn't do anything.  I love a break in the action, which I call winter, where you could be lazy and kind of 
[02:05:00]  not like, oh, the sun's out.  It's beautiful.  I got to be outside.  I got to do this.  I got to go here.  I got to, you know, I like the pace of winter.  It's a nice break.  Yeah, but you also.  But some people get, it's clinically depressed when it gets.  Dude, you wake up, it's dark.  You go to 4 o'clock, it's dark.  It's dark all day.  It's the inauguration.  It's.  Jesus.  All right.  No.  We almost made it to the end.  We could all have fun.  We had three hours of fun, except for about five minutes there where that caller had to 
[02:05:30]  get Anthony going.  No, but he's got the diabetes and he went into one of those diabetic.  What are they called?  Episodes.  What?  Shock.  Shock.  Shock.  Shock, yeah.  Insulin shock.  While he was in the air.  Oh, shit.  So he was, oh my God, we're having a problem.  And he said, because he sent out an email that, like, he's prepared for this and he has  candy bars on him always.  So when he's feeling like he's going to go into this.  Yeah.  You chump down a candy bar, it takes care of the situation. 
[02:06:00]  I do that with beer.  When you get the shakes.  Yeah, I get the shakes.  I get all the shakes.  An 18-year-old.  So plane landed at its destination.  It wasn't where they had to, like, land immediately, because I guess they were close to landing.  They took my brother off the plane right into an ambulance and all that crap yesterday.  Wow.  Wow.  He's good now?  Blood, urine, everything completely fine.  He knows exactly what it was.  Yeah.  It's just his hell on earth.  Everyone has their little hell on earth. 
[02:06:30]  That's his.  Your cross is to bear.  He got the diabetes when he was 22, 21, something like that.  He went blind for a couple of days.  Really?  Yeah.  Holy mother.  He's one of the guys that has to shoot himself up every day.  It's a nightmare for him.  I feel bad.  But Brother Elmo on MySpace, if you want to give him a couple words today.  I dated a girl with him.  But he said he's fine and back in the spirits.  Huh?  Does he have a Twitter?  I don't think he's tweeting yet.  Oh, Facebooking?  He's a MySpace guy.  Actually, his MySpace page is pretty damn good.  He's an OG. 
[02:07:00]  What's an OG?  I don't know.  MySpace.  That's original gangster.  Ah, yes.  It's mold school.  I'm AOL.  But he's doing well, so.  All right.  We didn't get to the mayor.  Do you want to squeeze this in after the break and then we'll leave?  Yeah, we'll do that.  All right.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Sorry to make you sit through commercials.  We really wanted to do more, but look at the time.  Everyone's getting uptight about us staying past nine.  Damn it.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:07:30]  Satellite wants us out of here at 845.  Mark Chernoff gets a little nervous if we move into music marathon territory, so we've kind  of got a window from 845 to 9.  Going past nine is becoming a no-no for a lot of people.  Yeah.  So I'm sorry.  I think we've just got to leave now.  Well, but good news.  We've got the music marathon that's about to begin here in New York.  Now, did they learn from their beating yesterday, Danny? 
[02:08:00]  It's a very big day.  The first day of the black president, so I'm assuming the music marathon's got some fine  thing today.  I think he's got a name.  The black president, Obama.  Wow.  I know.  I was waiting for the vocals to kick in and they never do.  What's the music marathon today, Danny?  Well, first up, you've got immigrant song, Led Zeppelin.  All right.  Well, look.  Immigrant. 
[02:08:30]  Well, let the browns stick around.  Let the browns stick around.  That one's for you.  The immigrant song.  So immigrants, if you're listening, you've got one coming up.  What else?  We've got ACDC, Whole Lotta Rosie.  Rosa Parks.  Very obvious.  All right.  That was obvious.  Just trying to hip it up a little bit with the Rosie instead of Rosa.  Very good, Mark Chernoff.  You're doing a fine job with this rock station here in New York.  What's the next one, Danny?  We've got Basket Case by Green Day.  For Anthony.  Going a little local there.  That's nice. 
[02:09:00]  Going crazy.  Very good.  What transpired yesterday.  This is the brilliance of Mark Chernoff.  He knows how to seg these songs together to give you a fine music marathon.  Give me one more, Danny.  We will rock you, Queen.  Ah.  We will rock you, Queen.  Queen.  All right.  Let's try another one.  Maybe his genius goes over my head, too.  Wish you were here, Pink Floyd? 
[02:09:30]  Well, that's obvious.  How about Norton's show in Florida?  We will rock you, Queen.  You ruin everything.  Queen.  You just ruin everything.  You get to add to the show some way.  Sometimes it's ruining it.  Sometimes it's ruining it.  We've got to burn the village to save it.  Like those crazy Vietnam guys.  If you're going to wreck the party, you might as well just wreck it.  All right, Callie.  I'm actually a big fan of Robert Kelly.  You were fine today, bro. 
[02:10:00]  All right, listen.  We've got to go.  What are you promoting, Robert?  Robert, robertkellylive.com for everything that has something to do with you.  I still would like to beat Voss on that stand-up comedy competition.  All right, when does that end?  It's on right now.  It's off the website, but you can still text stand-up Kelly to 66333.  You don't know.  No, I swear to God.  I just told you.  You were, like, pausing too much.  I say it real slow. 
[02:10:30]  You wear that hat, you're winning any comedy competition.  What is that?  It's my hat.  It's my hat.  It's my hat, sir.  It's got fur on it and ear flaps.  It's a hat.  I fly a plane in the afternoons on Xbox.  It came with my controller.  Yeah, like the Red Baron.  I have goggles and everything.  Are you a water buffalo?  Yeah.  What was that?  He was in the loyal order of water buffalo. 
[02:11:00]  It really is.  I'll tell you what, though.  Remember when I said we weren't supposed to do any more radio?  I know.  As we do more radio.  I remember that.  It was well before.  We'll really try.  All right.  Stand up Kelly.  Yeah.  Text that to 66333.  Okay, perfect.  But you can text as many times as you want.  Thousands of times.  That would be cheating.  I need probably around 12,000 votes.  To beat Voss?  Yeah.  What's wrong with you?  I don't know. 
[02:11:30]  Somebody cheated.  Nothing against Voss, but...  No, Voss is up there.  Voss is up there.  Wowee.  Yeah.  12,000 votes by this afternoon.  All right.  One more song, Danny, as far as the music marathon goes.  All right.  How about you two, New Year's Day?  It's January...  Let's see.  Pano.  I went too far with the pit.  Yeah.  Yeah, I went a little too far.  All right.  Later.  Music marathon time. 
[02:12:00]  Right now.  Go.  Bobby, help me out with this, because you're the big MMA guy.  Although, I'm getting more and more into it as the days go by, the weeks go by.  We had Tito in here yesterday.  He's promoting this.  Did he make an announcement?  Is he in it?  Tito, we learned yesterday from Tito Ortiz that he had back surgery.  He had some vertebrae fused or something.  Some kind of surgery.  Wow. 
[02:12:30]  Who the fuck farted for real?  Nobody.  Who's messing with me?  No.  I never blasted in the studio.  Did you sneak one out, Ant?  No, I never blasted in the studio.  Bobby?  No, if I did, I'd be very proud of it.  Danny, you really didn't fart?  Especially if it was just...  Who was just in here?  This fart is horrendous.  I don't smell it.  No, you know what's funny?  I don't smell it.  I heard Derek outside of the studio, and he said something smelled like rotting something  or other.  Oh, shit.  Are Ron and Fez getting us back finally for the liquid ass shit?  Because it is horrendous. 
[02:13:00]  Is it in garbage back there?  I don't smell it.  Maybe it's in the garbage.  Bobby, are you setting me up?  Because I set you up last week?  Let me tell you something.  Look in my eyes.  I swear to God.  Look into my eyes.  Look into my eyes.  Something's going on.  I'm not stupid.  It's not the garbage.  Did you bring that deer shit in you were talking about?  No.  No, but I'm glad you're paranoid right now.  Because it's just as good as if you had.  It's better.  A flinch is way better than a smack.  This is what Tito's doing.  He's working with Affliction.  They get their pay-per-view coming up Saturday.  M1 Global, Day of Reckoning, live on pay-per-view Saturday at 9 p.m., 6 p.m. Pacific. 
[02:13:30]  Right.  Tito is going to be announcing.  He's going to be an announcer for a while.  And he told us yesterday that he expects to be fighting by the end of the year.  Really?  With Affliction.  He's got some major rehab to go through still.  What?  With Affliction?  It sounds like that, yeah.  Because you know how Affliction, this whole company, got started, right?  No.  The only reason why this company got started is because Dana White wouldn't let them wear  the Affliction t-shirts in the arena.  Oh, really?  On the shows.  And it was just, what, a clothing line back then? 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, he just wanted to fight.  All the fighters wore Affliction.  Right.  They were all signed with them.  Right.  And he was like, you can't wear them anymore.  You have to wear our stuff or somebody else's.  So he was like, all right.  And he just went and started his own company.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Which is good, though, because UFC is the top dog.  Right.  You can't get better than UFC.  But this guy, this show right here.  It's nice, right?  It's not nice.  This show, from front to back, is a solid, solid card.  We had Fedor in, and he's fighting Saturday.  Yeah.  That would be worth it just to see Fedor. 
[02:14:30]  He never comes over here.  Hardly ever.  But all the other fights on here, too, are unbelievable.  Well, what about this Andre the Pitbull?  Arlovsky?  Yeah.  He was the UFC champ for a while.  He really was, huh?  He's a badass.  He's not going to be an easy fight for Fedor, even though everyone is.  How scary was he the other day?  He's just, his silence and his calmness is frightening, knowing that we were sitting  with the tough, the baddest guy, the baddest motherfucker on the plane. 
[02:15:00]  I like to think that I could handle myself, and I'm a badass to a certain extent.  Right.  And then someone like that comes in, and you go, I'm nothing.  You're not a real man.  I'm barely a man.  I thought I was more than this.  He could just take from you anything he wanted.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I was telling Patrice, because, you know, Patrice was making me nervous, because, you know,  he'll blow up a spot just to see what happens.  Yeah.  I had a few ideas, too, by the way.  You would have saw me kicking.  I was humbled.  I would have kicked you in the ribs with him. 
[02:15:30]  I was humbled, man.  Oh, yeah.  This card is unbelievable, though.  You got Babalu is fighting, which he's great.  He got kicked out of the UFC for putting on a choke just a little too long after the guy's  had.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he held it too long.  A little take that with you?  Yeah, a little take that with you.  Yeah, take that with you.  And there's another guy fighting on here, and it's not on here.  What the hell is his name?  He was from the IFL.  A lot of the IFL guys, which the company fell apart, is gone, are fighting with affliction 
[02:16:00]  now, which is great.  All right.  They picked up a lot of fighters from the IFL.  He does know a lot about this.  Yeah, it's really good.  All right.  We gave him enough, Bobby.  I'm going to watch Saturday, pay-per-view.  It's, what is it being called?  M1 Global Affliction, Day of Reckoning.  They want us to mention Donald J. Trump, but he's not doing anything.  What is he doing?  If he gets in the ring, then I'll start mentioning that he's fighting.  He's sweating into a dungaree jacket.  Yeah, wow.  How pompous are you? 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, you got this great fight card, but make sure you mention that it's Donald J.  Trump's league or something, or he's involved in this.  Yeah, and Golden Boy.  I want to see the monsters, not Donald J.  Trump.  De La Hoya is...  Two-headed girls are going to be there?  De La Hoya is involved, too.  Yeah, they should be fighting each other now.  That's the main event.  Put them in the ring.  Where's their opponent?  Oh, they don't have an opponent.  MMA.  They'll just be punching each other non-stop.  One's trying to tap out.  Right.  All right, we did enough.  Pay-per-view Saturday, 9 p.m.  Contact your pay-per-view provider to order. 
[02:17:00]  All right, we're going to continue.  Danny's got a fine bit for us.  We're going to get to that in a second, though, Danny, right?  We're going to do a little mopping up first.  Because I promised the people this story.  We'd like to talk about the perv switch on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  And we have a mayor out of Wisconsin.  Jesus.  What are you doing?  This guy's up to some shenanigans.  You're the mayor.  What are you doing? 
[02:17:30]  Mm-hmm.  Cheesehead mayor and sex flap.  Cheesehead.  Milwaukee.  The mayor of some town in Wisconsin resigned yesterday, days after being accused of trying  to arrange a sex romp with an, with an, with an, uh...  I know you can't say the word.  N.  No, no, no.  With who?  I thought you were just saying.  With who?  You think?  There's only a couple choices.  Did he go gay?  Did he go underage?  Underage, but I don't know if it's boy or girl.  Is there another choice in there that would get you in a lot of trouble? 
[02:18:00]  Animal?  I'd say underage, but I don't know if it's boy or girl.  The answer would be underage, Anthony.  Mayor Gary Becker stepped down in a one-sentence letter.  Yeah.  Best not say much.  That made no reference to the six felony charges he faces.  Six felony charges.  One sentence for six felonies?  Wow.  That fucker.  Defense lawyer Patrick Cafferty said Becker decided to resign.  And the Beaver Brown.  Right. 
[02:18:30]  Decided to resign because it was in the best interest of everyone involved.  Yeah.  He said his client intends to plead, not guilty, to all charges.  He was arrested, Anthony, January 13th after, this is where the perv switch goes off, after  arranging to meet with what he thought was a 14-year-old girl.  Oh.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Oh.  But it was actually a cop.  Of course.  It's safe to say they're all cops at this point. 
[02:19:00]  It's always a cop.  What are you doing?  Maybe in the wild, wild west years of the internet, you were meeting the 14-year-olds,  but not, who's doing this now?  No one's doing it anymore.  You've got to be crazy.  14-year-old girl.  It was a cop.  He offered to take the girl to a hotel to have lots of fun.  His quote.  Child porn was also allegedly found on his computer.  And we got an update to the story.  That wasn't in the paper, but now it's official.  The investigation started last month after Becker asked city workers to help him fix a problem 
[02:19:30]  with his...  He's making all the mistakes.  Oh, no.  Is this, like, textbook fuck-up?  Yeah, absolutely.  Guy has a problem with his computer.  He asked some city workers to help him fix a problem with his personal computer.  Took it where Gary Glitter took his.  Right.  Police said the computer technician found six pornographic images of what appeared to be  underage females and alerted authority.  Police passed the pictures around the station house. 
[02:20:00]  Hey, check this out.  Yeah, let me jerk off to that.  No, the police did not do that.  Police passed the case on to state investigators to avoid a conflict of interest.  Yeah.  Investigators who searched Becker's computer found records of how many sexually explicit  chats, Anthony, would you guess?  This guy was...  10 million.  How about 1,800?  All right.  This guy was a bad...  1,800 little chats.  Yeah.  1,800, so...  Wow.  Goodbye. 
[02:20:30]  Bye-bye.  There goes your career.  Yeah.  Gonzo.  It's not like shock jock radio where, you know, you sit out a little while.  For that?  For politics like that, unless, you know, you're...  No, underage shit.  You don't sit out for a while in shock jock radio land.  They got a guy recently.  I forgot what market, but he was a bad boy.  Boston?  Perino?  Wow.  Yeah, there was one even, like, more recent than that.  Oh, no, I know.  Every so often it says, you know, disc jockey and underage sex flap. 
[02:21:00]  Now, I want to do a little clean-up from yesterday.  Sam, very upset because Vince McMahon is very injured again.  You know, this was overshadowed by the inauguration.  Yeah.  Apparently, Vince McMahon, who was injured, Sam comes in shaking his head like, oh, he's so  upset about it.  I'm really sorry that I haven't been kind of present with the show.  Yeah, I've noticed, like, your mind's been a little preoccupied.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I know it's an important time with the inauguration and everything going on. 
[02:21:30]  I would have liked to have been here more.  Yeah.  But there's some other stuff going on in my life.  Now, last we left, you and the Vince McMahon saga was, I think, seven to eight months ago.  He was injured.  Yeah, it was six months ago.  Six months ago.  What happened for the people out there that don't give a shit but might hang in there for  a little longer before they go to fucking a rock station?  He was giving away a million bucks a week to lucky fans who were watching, and then 
[02:22:00]  on the last week, the set fell down on top of him, and the stage broke, and basically  he was left.  And basically didn't injure him at all, but he decided he needed hair plugs or a facelift  or some eye work done, so he decided to disappear for six months.  No, because all the wrestlers came over, and they had to help him, and he said that he  couldn't feel his legs.  But when the whole stage collapsed, Sam, you don't want to acknowledge the fact that  there was a safe area for Vince McMahon to be.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:22:30]  So nothing actually happened to him as all hell was coming loose.  And that rig, that lighting rig or whatever it was, was hinged on the bottom.  Right.  It didn't fall over.  It was hinged and fell exactly where it was supposed to.  I've been looking at that, and I did notice the hinge.  I'm not an idiot.  No, I would never suggest that.  But what I realized is...  Let's just play one on the radio.  They travel from city to city every day, every week.  Raw is live, and they were using the same set, so obviously they need something that can  disassemble. 
[02:23:00]  That was a disassembling mechanism.  Lucky for Vince.  No, it fell on him.  That's not lucky.  Oh.  So I thought it just missed him.  No, it fell on him.  All right.  We'll play in your world for a while, Sam.  So when it fell on him, what happened to Mr. McMahon?  Well, he was terribly injured, but...  No details.  No, because they wanted to keep it private.  Yeah, because that's what the McMahon family does, keeps everything private in their life.  They're a very private family.  Oh, are they?  By the way, because it's all about Twitter the last couple of days, and trust me, we'll 
[02:23:30]  relax and go back to regular crap again.  But Blue Heeler writes, Sam wasted a Twitter update on a Vince announcement.  Well, I just...  Because I like to keep my Twitter updated with what's going on in my life, and I was kind of  absent from that, too, so I said that my thoughts and prayers were with Mr. McMahon.  You're going to lose followers.  You're going to lose eyeballs.  You're going to lose eyeballs.  The eyeballs care, too.  It's all about eyeballs, right, kids?  But how many eyeballs do you have?  So Stephanie came back.  Yeah.  And she was in charge of Raw while Vince was gone.  Vince made his big return this week, on Monday. 
[02:24:00]  Vince made his big return.  Wait a minute.  He has not been back.  No, not at all.  Since that thing fell on him.  The fake injury.  The fake injury.  We'll play along.  Since that big piece of mechanism, whatever it was, fell on him and injured him.  I call it the horrible accident.  Since the horrible accident.  Yeah.  He has not been back.  No.  So this was his first day back in front of a huge crowd.  Yes.  Sold out, as always.  He had not been seen since that horrible accident. 
[02:24:30]  Nope.  And there was no formal announcement, no press release.  He was staying out of the public eye to recuperate.  So obviously he had recuperated.  Thank God.  He seemed to be fine in the clip I saw.  He was doing his McMahon strut and everything.  Yeah.  So Sam, why do you think he's out of the public eye for so long?  I was told recently, can he porn on his computer?  No.  What do you think?  He was...  What was he dealing with?  Well...  An illegitimate child in Des Moines?  What's he got?  What's he got going?  The only thing he's got going is a fear of paralysis because when the thing fell on him, 
[02:25:00]  he said he couldn't feel his legs.  Yeah.  Well, apparently that didn't happen.  No, thank God.  Thank God.  And they didn't explain this?  No.  Just like the fake car explosion?  No, they didn't explain...  Remember that one?  Yeah.  Remember?  Well...  No, he did explain that.  He said he faked his own death to see if people still liked him.  Oh.  And they did.  That's a good idea.  They cared.  It's a mature thing to do.  Yes.  Sane, mature thing.  Blow up a limousine.  Because you're not sure if people like you.  Like you. 
[02:25:30]  It makes sense.  Is it true he...  Is it true he spent his time off digging up Chris Benoit?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  And he repeatedly punched him in the face for ruining his exploding limo bit.  No.  By actually dying when he wanted a fake die.  I would assume his time was spent in hospital and physical therapy.  Yeah, all right.  You would assume.  I would assume.  But again, no formal announcements, so we don't know.  But he came back.  Mm-hmm.  And first they made Chris Jericho apologize to the fans for the way he's been treating them. 
[02:26:00]  Mm-hmm.  Because he's been a bad guy.  Has he?  Then...  And because Vince hasn't been there to straighten him out?  Exactly.  Exactly, of course.  Then Randy Orton came out.  Mm-hmm.  And he said that Stephanie McMahon had slapped him in the face on Raw that night, and he wanted  an apology from Stephanie.  Oh.  How did he...  How did she slap him?  With her big, massive breast implants?  No.  With her hand.  You better watch it there, pally.  Why?  Because that clip could get played one day when Triple H is in here. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Mark that clip.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I ain't dealing with that monster.  It's all about the monsters these days.  And so I think...  What clips do I have there?  I think I had the clip of Randy Orton.  I love Stephanie McMahon's new groups, by the way.  Who doesn't?  Big fan.  Big fan.  I don't think they're new, though.  She's had those from one.  She's had two kids, too.  Yeah.  Really?  Two kids.  Wow.  Amazing.  I got to say, I'm sorry.  Keep that McMahon family going. 
[02:27:00]  That's nice.  But, yeah, what's that first track labeled?  I think, uh...  Labeled, this is horse shit.  What?  Oh, this is labeled, uh, show filler.  What do you mean, show filler?  Show filler.  No, that's not what I wrote that.  Wow.  And track two's labeled, this should get you to 11 o'clock.  No, that's not what I wrote.  Randy Orton explains that he is worth more than Stephanie McMahon.  Right.  He said he wants an apology because he's worth more to the company.  All right, sir.  Uh-huh.  Here we go.  Because I am worth more than she is.  Because people pay to see me and not you. 
[02:27:30]  The crowd's not with him.  No.  No.  And you might not want to admit this, but ever since your daughter here has popped you out  a couple of grandkids...  Oh, shit.  Yeah, this is...  She has become essentially worthless.  Now, you can obviously assume that did not sit too well with Mr. McMahon.  Yeah, but this is my question, especially with the bad economy. 
[02:28:00]  Uh-huh.  Shouldn't he be fired immediately?  Wouldn't you just fire him?  That's what you...  Enough with the nonsense.  Coincidentally enough.  You're right.  Oh, am I, Sam?  If Mr. McMahon said, Orton, you apologize right now, or I'll fire you on the spot.  All right, see?  But why would you just fire him on the spot?  Well, because he's, you know, he's a good actor.  You know, why would you give him a chance to even apologize when he says something so  nasty?  You know how easy our careers would have been?  Oh, Mel, I'm really sorry. 
[02:28:30]  Okay, that's fine.  Well, Mr. McMahon...  You're not fired.  He's got a big heart.  Does he?  Yes.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  All right, here we go.  Randy Orton!  Yeah!  Oh!  All right, what happened?  Oh, my God.  Because he said...  Yeah!  He got all revved up.  Yeah, because he said, I'm going to fire you on the spot.  Randy Orton said, you don't want to do that.  And so Vince said, you're fired.  And Randy Orton slapped him across his face.  He only got the you're out.  You know, the you're is followed by fire.  Yeah.  Fire. 
[02:29:00]  And this...  Can't do it because my throat...  Shit.  This is kind of where the humor leaves the clip.  Oh.  Because at this point, Vince McMahon...  This is where the humor leaves it?  What?  That's to say there was humor to begin with.  Yeah.  Well, we were all having fun before.  I think the humor found an off-ramp a few miles back.  I don't know.  Yeah.  1978.  Vince fell to the ground because he got slapped hard by Randy Orton.  Yeah.  And Randy Orton then... 
[02:29:30]  He kicked Vince McMahon in his head.  No.  He kicked him once to position him.  And then when Vince McMahon was on all fours, he punted his head.  Punted.  So...  He punted Vince's head.  What's the difference?  A punt is much harder.  So he just kind of kicked his head first...  Yeah.  ...to get it in punt position.  Yeah.  And then he backed up and punted Vince's head.  At which point, Vince was left completely unresponsive.  So he was back for how long? 
[02:30:00]  He was back for...  He did it about ten minutes.  So...  He's done ten minutes in the last six months.  He was injured.  I would love that job.  Drastically injured in the horrible accident, as you like to call it.  Yeah.  He comes back six months later, and within ten minutes, they're carting him out again  on a stretcher, the ambulance guys...  And Stephanie ran into the ring screaming.  Really?  Yeah, we...  Oh, did she?  We can listen to her.  Now this...  All right.  This will tell if this is real or not, because Stephanie is not the best actress. 
[02:30:30]  Right.  I've never seen her act.  I don't know.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I don't know.  You never saw her when she was chained to that pipe?  No, I saw that.  The Undertaker put her down there, and...  Yeah, I saw that.  She's like, please, Daddy, and...  Right, when she was kidnapped.  Yes.  Look...  Look at Vince McMahon's haircut from my boy's life.  In this boy's life, it does...  I mean, this...  Yeah.  He's got this boy's life hair.  What the fuck is that?  Maybe he got some hair follicle restoration.  I don't know. 
[02:31:00]  His hair's a lot shorter.  Something's going on up there.  He got more of a puffy cut, and he's not dying it.  Yeah.  Because he had black hair.  After he got it shaved.  Yeah.  At WrestleMania that time.  He just let it grow, and...  And now he's kept it short.  That's wonderful, Sam.  So, obviously, Randy Orton is fired, because...  And probably in jail.  Yeah, and in jail.  Well, that's the thing.  You'd think he was...  Did he go to his arraignment?  While security was in the ring, Randy Orton and Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase Jr...  Left the country?  No, ran to the locker room.  Well, so... 
[02:31:30]  Why couldn't the police go into the locker room?  That is, like, attempted murder.  Well, yeah.  So why didn't the police arrest him?  Well, probably he had a getaway car waiting for him in the locker room.  Lucky for him to didn't explode.  Didn't he have a car in the locker room?  It's good to know.  No, right outside the locker room.  It's good to know these guys don't have to live by the same rules we do, Sam.  Well, they're wrestlers.  They're big stars.  But here's the whole clip with Vince getting knocked to the ground, punted.  His head is punted, and then Stephanie showing the whole thing is actually real. 
[02:32:00]  Because her acting is horrendous, so...  What?  What?  I don't know.  Randy Orton!  Yeah!  Oh, my God!  Oh!  No!  It's when he punted his head.  Get some help out here!  Yeah!  See?  It's out!  You can't still hear me. 
[02:32:30]  Please talk to me!  Please talk to me!  Please talk to me!  Please!  I know.  We're going to take care of him.  Please talk to me, Dan.  Please talk to me, Dan.  He wasn't responding at all.  Of course he wasn't.  All right, well...  Totally unresponsive.  Oh, wow.  He kicked him.  He did boot him right in the...  Oh!  Oh, my God.  And there he is, unresponsive.  Unresponsive.  And at this point, Randy Orton, because he was acting out of pure emotion...  Yes, yes.  ...realizes, what have I done?  Did he see the error in his ways there?  And now he's...  Oh, my God. 
[02:33:00]  See?  What have I done?  Wow.  He was so wound up and into this situation that he...  Mr. McMahon was only back for 10 minutes.  10 minutes.  It's dangerous.  Why does Vince need a year off, by the way?  With a 10-minute break during his year-long vacation?  That's all I want to know.  I don't think a hospital stay in physical therapy is a year off.  Neither do I.  That's why I'm asking.  Why does he need a year off?  Look at Stephanie, all despondent. 
[02:33:30]  See what I mean?  He's not opening his eyes.  He's not moving.  At least he had his eyes open when the titantron fell on him.  Yes, yes.  The titantron.  When those guys come in who are in the khakis, plain dressed, those are real guys.  Obviously.  They're EFTs.  Those are real.  They're not like the wrestlers that...  Well, they've got to be big to lift him up and put him on the stretcher.  Oh, okay.  And then they show it again in slow motion, and it's just...  Oh, the story's still developing, right, Sam?  Yeah, because we don't know.  We don't know if he's okay? 
[02:34:00]  No.  Why wouldn't they report on this now?  Because now...  Oh!  There was the accident.  Look at this.  The head punt.  Being a huge entertainment entity, you would think this would be on all the news channels.  Yeah, now, why isn't this, at least on their website, his condition?  I know they're very private people, but this was a public thing.  Yeah.  This wasn't an accident.  This is a crime.  Yeah.  Believe me, it's a fucking crime.  Well, I don't know. 
[02:34:30]  The thing about the media is they tend to pick and choose their stories, and I think the prejudice  against professional wrestling as an industry is really coming into the limelight with the  amount of time they're spending on this inauguration thing and not covering Vince McMahon's condition  at all.  I mean, look at that.  Oh, my God.  He was completely assaulted.  I don't even know if he survived, quite frankly.  I just learned how to do a fake kick to the head, by the way.  How?  If you get both feet in the air, then if you kick the guy, it's not as damaging.  Yeah, and then you pull the kick back. 
[02:35:00]  Right.  We should try that right now with Sam's head, no kidding.  Wow.  They couldn't move his neck.  They had to tape it down and everything.  You can't move a guy like that, because they don't know what's wrong with him.  How come the camera people are allowed in so close when the EMTs are working on Mr. McMahon?  Why wouldn't they tell them, please get out of here, don't tape this?  Because even the EMTs know, as Mr. McMahon would say, the show must go on.  But then he doesn't talk. 
[02:35:30]  So if the show must go on, how about you give us information on how you feel?  How about we see video of your rehabilitation?  Maybe we'll find out on Smackdown Friday night.  Right?  Maybe.  If we tune on to my network on Friday night, we'll get to see Smackdown.  We'll find out on Smackdown sometime in April.  A year off.  Okay.  The smell is either my sweatpants or the chair itself. 
[02:36:00]  Oh my God, if you have ass.  Every time I move.  When was the last time you changed those?  Because I know you could wear sweatpants for a long time.  I'm only two days in.  Did you have cranky ass?  No, I don't think so.  I'll smell the chair in a second or two.  Thank you, Sam, for that amazing Vince McMahon update.  All right, so we will...  Wow, we've got to keep updated.  Please, keep me updated because you know I'm a huge fan of Vince McMahon and I care about  what happens to him.  Sounds tragic.  Yeah, we'll keep you guys updated.  Sounds really tragic. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah?  You know wrestling's fake, right?  Well, I mean, you know, some people say it's like they kind of...  They know what they're doing and everything, but a lot of the stuff that happens, like this  stuff, doesn't end up being real, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, that's the real stuff.  Because you're not going to fake a kick to the head.  Why would you work on your body that much and not use it?  For real, that's what I...  That's why I think it's real.  Seriously.  Yeah.  No, I'm with you, Sam.  Yeah.  If you're going to spend eight hours in the gym to look like, once again, a monster,  of course then this has to be real.  Right.  All right, why do you need abs to fake kick somebody in the face? 
[02:37:00]  Right, right.  Exactly.  You see the abs on Randy Orton?  That guy is cut.  And if you're having an argument with somebody about insulting your daughter like he did,  you would give each of them a microphone and let them, you know, go at it like that.  Because that's what you do when you have an argument.  Instead of taking it in the back office where Vince could be the boss and tell him, look,  you sit down, here's what happened, you apologize, you're fired.  Give him the mic, get him out in the ring.  Well, the thing about DW Raw is uncut, uncooked, uncensored. 
[02:37:30]  Live TV, you know what I mean?  That's the motto they used to have.  You know, a little catchphrase.  Yeah.  And they might not have an office in the back.  Exactly.  That might be a stage, that ring might be a vintage office.  That's their office.  Well, you know something, there's cameras everywhere, too.  I've seen them go in the back, and there's cameras back there, too.  So it could have happened anywhere.  Thank God it happened in the ring because it could have happened on the cement.  I've seen that, too.  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine?  Oh, my God, please.  Guys are having secret conversations with, like, what they're going to do, and they don't want  anybody else to know.  And there's a giant camera right next to them, and a mic boom, but they'll keep talking. 
[02:38:00]  Well, you don't realize, after a while of being a wrestler in the spotlight, you don't  even know when there's a camera there anymore.  No, but I heard it's a WWE camera.  It's only like a fly.  It's really small.  It's like a fly-on-the-wall camera.  Yeah, that's what it's called.  Brilliant, yeah.  It's a fly-on-the-wall camera.  They don't even know it's there.  That makes sense.  Right?  That makes sense.  All right, look.  I hope the show must go on on this show right now.  Are we talking about this?  Flying around a hunk of bullshit.  What?  That is this storyline. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, really.  This is Greg Hughes now talking.  We're human, you're enough.  We get the fuck out of here.  Jesus Christ.  Thank you.  All the best if you hear something.  I will, yeah.  Hey, we're going to get to Sam's, sorry, Danny, and I think Travis helped you out with this  a little bit, too.  A fine bit.  What is it called, Danny?  It's called R.U. Gay.  R.U. Gay.  Yes.  I saw you were going for that.  This is perfectly Robert Kelly.  Could you describe it?  What it means? 
[02:39:00]  Well, I found a website where basically people who are confused.  Wait, keep the T's there.  Okay.  Because we're going to take a break.  Okay.  We're going to do this R.U. Gay thing.  Sure.  And Robert Kelly's here, and Danny will explain the whole thing.  It's pretty funny, actually.  I am.  The bit is pretty funny.  It sounds sexy.  Hey, beforehand, though, we got some video gamers in studio.  I'm smelling something every so often.  It's when I move.  It's this chair.  I'm convinced of it.  Smell the chair.  I can't smell it at all.  Sniff that seat.  Obie looks like Robert Redford from the back. 
[02:39:30]  Is it?  In the natural.  Is it bad?  Is it the same?  It's not good.  As opposed to good?  It's poofing up some smells every time you sit in this thing.  Oh, shit.  How do you clean chairs?  You throw them out and buy a new one.  Really?  That's the only way to clean your chair.  I would love to do that, but times are tough.  This clip has been sitting here.  I want to get rid of this one. 
[02:40:00]  14-year-old and family fight off an intruder.  14-year-old and family?  Right.  Nice.  The beauty of this clip, the kid calls 911 like it's a video game.  No way.  Listen to this.  Also in California, a family and their dog fight off an intruder at their home.  14-year-old Nick Garvin screamed for help after hearing his 160-pound great-dane barking.  Nick's parents came to the rescue and started fighting with the suspect. 
[02:40:30]  I was on the phone, actually, with the operator.  My mom was struggling.  I just started lugging on him.  I was like, get down, stay down.  And the cop girl's like, what's going on, Nick?  Tell me right now what's going on.  I'm like, my parents are fighting.  Hold on, hold on.  Boom, boom.  It's like playing Call of Duty.  The guy sounds like every kid.  That's what I mean.  Thank you.  You hear over the mic, over the headset mic on Call of Duty.  Fucking cocksuckers.  I was like, boom, boom.  He's so excited.  It's real life, dummy. 
[02:41:00]  He could have been dead.  Asshole laughing at you because you walked into his bouncing beddy for the fucking 18th time.  Fucking cut.  The only thing that would have made that better is instead of boom, boom, he went pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.  All right, quick break.  Are you gay?  With Robert Kelly.  Wait a minute.  Can you say my name last?  Are you gay, Robert Kelly?  And it just goes to Robert Kelly.  You can cut that up any way you want.  But yes, I am half gay.  You'll explain that too. 
[02:41:30]  Okay.  You learned that, what, you're 54% gay?  54%.  Robert Kelly will explain that.  That's kind of why we wanted to do the bit with Bobby here because we know he's a little gay.  So he might have some good opinions.  A little gay.  A little.  I'm definitely not the gayest.  All right.  Danny found something very fun for the show today.  It's called Are You Gay?  And I guess it's a website.  Yeah, it's a website called Am I Gay? 
[02:42:00]  And I guess you can go there and you can submit your questions if you're curious or if you have weird, strange feelings that you're not comfortable with.  You could go to this website and anonymously ask the question, are you gay?  But this is kind of our bit.  We do gay or funny.  Yes, it is.  And I thought we could probably tackle this and take a few gay or funny calls at the same time.  Because as guys, you do end up getting into these kind of gay scenarios, but you're doing it for the laugh and not for the gay. 
[02:42:30]  So we do a bit called Gay or Funny and you call up.  And what was one of the ones?  Oh, one of the ones was, this is a perfect example of gay or funny.  A guy calls up and he goes, all right, we're all at my friend's pool.  And of course he has to go, there were women there.  And one guy, they convince this guy, I don't think you can hold your breath underwater for the whole lap of the pool.  The guy goes, fuck you, I can do that.  And he jumps in.  And as he's underwater trying to get to the other side, his buddy, like, drops his bathing suit and has his ball bag and his penis right there waiting for the guy when, you know, when you do try. 
[02:43:00]  And he comes up for air.  And you know when we all try to do that, you know, that first breath is like.  Yeah.  And there was waiting for him, you know, the guy's penis and ballies.  And we determined that was just funny.  That's funny.  That's just funny, not gay.  What happened after it was gay?  We just started sucking him.  And the guy slowly fell to his knees and let him do it.  Yeah.  Shut a load of the pool. 
[02:43:30]  So I guess this website kind of does what we've been doing for a while, but that's okay.  So what do you want us to do, Danny?  You want us to read the questions?  Yeah, I thought maybe you guys would have your own opinions on some of these questions.  Well, Bobby is an expert on this stuff.  And maybe you would disagree with perhaps the owner of this website and his responses.  Maybe you would have some other responses.  Okay.  And these are the best ones you picked?  Yeah, these are some funny ones.  I mean, there's more, obviously, but these are some good ones.  But whoever reads this is going to sound gay.  Those clips are never leaving. 
[02:44:00]  Those clips will be with you and follow you forever.  We could have David.  You want David to read them?  He would take so long.  That's true.  I've always been...  You know what?  If you're really, really bothered by it, you could always play that music bed.  And that way we can't cut it off a production.  I'm not bothered.  We got what?  Am I gay thinking music?  Yeah.  Great.  All right, here's the am I gay thinking music.  How about we take turns?  I'll do the first one.  Questions from men. 
[02:44:30]  I've always been into women.  And I love the female body.  Let me change my voice as someone else later on.  Yeah.  And sensitivity that women present.  However, every time I get a serious girlfriend, which has been about three or four times, such  as the one I have now, I dream of her getting fucked by another guy while she's giving me  head.  Jeez.  Or I dream of her sucking another guy's dick while I am doing her from behind. 
[02:45:00]  I make her tell me that she wishes she was getting fucked by one or two other guys while  she is sucking my cock, and it turns me on like nothing else.  I dream of her swallowing another guy's cum and slopping it onto my dick while she returns  to finish me off.  I like it, she likes it, and we both get extremely turned on by these fantasies that  we act out in fantasy land, although it has never happened in reality. 
[02:45:30]  I could never kiss a guy.  That disgusts me.  The other fuck doesn't?  But surprisingly, I could suck a guy's cock and sometimes dream of it.  I've even sucked up my girlfriend's dildo when she was unaware and I became extremely  turned on.  I have no desire to screw a guy in the ass.  That'd be gay.  But I sometimes think I'm sitting on a hard cock.  I've never acted out any of this, and I wonder if it should just remain in fantasy land. 
[02:46:00]  Am I by Ted?  It's Ted, and Jimmy's not here today?  I just realized that was a fucker.  Oh, damn it.  I like sucking on hard cocks.  Ted from California.  I'm a cuckold.  Ted the cuckold.  I wish you'd slop your cum on my cock.  I like it, she likes it.  We all like it.  Uh, Bobby?  Is this guy gay?  That's some gay stuff, no?  Did you get that off my computer? 
[02:46:30]  I have a tough time, and the phones will be lit once again, but there's a lot of guys  out there that could have another naked guy in the room.  I've had it many times.  And I just, I just can't do that.  I've had it many times.  And then a lot of guys are like, what's the big deal?  And we lose the argument all the time.  More guys will tell us, look, there's nothing gay about it at all.  I had Sherrod Smalls fucking blasting a flight attendant with his fucking 17-inch cock while I was trying  to get ahead. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, God.  Okay?  He was attached to her like a fucking alien.  What the fuck?  He was latched on, and I had to hold his sweaty head.  I had to hold it back because his head kept touching like where my cock was.  Right.  So, I don't know.  That's good for you guys.  I can pull it off.  I don't know.  Dude, let me tell you something.  There's nothing fucking better than to be fucking a chick from behind, and your friends  getting ahead, and then there's that second of eye contact where you both go, and you 
[02:47:30]  start giggling, and you've got to hold it in, and you're making it into a moan.  See, Bob, it's not a time to giggle.  Oh, it's hilarious.  You're high-fiving while you're fucking blasting a chick.  Look, I can't even argue it anymore.  We lost that argument with the listeners a long time ago.  A lot of dudes go, look, there's nothing wrong with it.  No, nothing wrong with it.  All right.  Here's the answer according to the website.  What do you think this guy is, Bobby?  What, this guy?  Well, he wants to suck on a dildo.  He has.  He has sucked on a dildo. 
[02:48:00]  Well, when you stop putting fucking cocks in your mouth alone on a couch while you're  watching reruns of fucking...  Yeah, I'm off of the show.  All right.  Here's what the website says.  It's a muscle.  Here's the answer.  Ted, wanting to watch another guy doing a girlfriend or having her suck his dick is not gay.  No.  Another guy's cum on your cock?  That's kind of gay.  That's kind of gay, sir.  Sucking and sitting on a cock? 
[02:48:30]  Definitely gay.  Or in your case, bi.  You definitely have the potential to be bi.  Whether you leave it as a fantasy is up to you, my friend, and your girlfriend.  If she's not involved in the scenario.  Or it says if she's involved in the scenario.  Oh, if she's involved in the scenario.  Yes.  There you go.  If this guy wants to suck a cock...  Yeah, you're gay.  He's...  He's gay.  Well, bi.  No, no, no, no. 
[02:49:00]  Wait, let me just defend this.  Bobby's fighting for bi.  Look at bi.  Because he does fuck chicks.  For his own happiness.  Look at me.  Anthony.  You.  You, you...  Look at me.  Yeah.  Look at me.  Look at my eyes with those big brown beautiful eyes.  I cannot fathom anyone wanting to suck a dick and not just be like, yeah, I'm gay.  So you can't go back to pussy after you suck a dick? 
[02:49:30]  You wouldn't want to.  Why not?  Because cock's so wonderful.  Because you just sucked a dick.  If you made that jump, it's like jumping off a cliff.  There's no going back.  Yeah.  Once I hit bottom, I'll fucking...  I'll go back.  I'll bet you're bottom.  You're bottom or top.  Sloppy party party.  Bobby John from Kansas City.  Is this true?  Bobby just wishes the woman wasn't in the room.  Yeah.  Well, she did.  All right, Ant, it's your turn.  Use a radio voice and then they can't cut this up and make it sound like this is you. 
[02:50:00]  Right.  Here's the Am I Gay thinking music.  All right.  After foreplay, when we're about to have sex, there's a 50-50 chance that my boyfriend is  going to put his penis between my butt cheeks and hump until he comes.  I guess this is...  Oh, wow.  This is the girl's side?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  After foreplay...  Can't do it, girl voice. 
[02:50:30]  Just remember, this is the girl.  It's just intense rubbing.  No anal penetration.  Even though I don't feel like I'm getting any pleasure from it, my vagina gets wet.  I mean, she's getting some kind of pleasure, no?  Pleasure.  And if he touches me down there and feels that I'm wet, it seems to turn him on even more.  What's going on here?  Well, he's affectionate in public and private with me, gets aroused easily by my body, especially 
[02:51:00]  if I'm wearing a low-top, short skirt or bathing suit.  And he was very straight.  Oh, and he was very upset that we dated almost six months before I finally agreed to have sex  with him.  All signs seem to point to straight, but the whole anal thing confuses me.  If he's not gay or bisexual, why is it that it takes him 20-plus minutes to come during  vaginal sex, but only five to seven minutes to come during anal? 
[02:51:30]  Because it's easier to pitch you as a little boy when you're on your stomach.  Can I answer this question, or do you want it, man?  Oh, be fielded.  Field this fucking fly ball into center field.  Because your asshole is much tighter, you loose cunt.  Do you know how a guy's anatomy works at all?  Well, because, too, when you're in the vagina, those tits ruin his fantasy.  It can't be a fucking young twink if it has nice tits. 
[02:52:00]  There can't be a woman that thinks that if a guy wants some ass sex that he's gay.  Right.  Unless it's off her brother or something.  Well, Anthony, why don't you answer as maybe as, because a lot of people say, and this  sounds a lot like maybe, in case I'm reading, oh, you can't do voices today.  No, I wish I could, man.  Maybe next time when we do this thing.  All right, what's the answer?  This guy, are we in agreement, is not gay? 
[02:52:30]  Not gay.  Not gay yet?  Uh, not gay.  This is so not gay.  All right.  This is the not-not-as-gay thing ever.  I've actually done this, rubbing your cock in the butt cheeks.  September 11th, I was on the set.  Are you talking 2001?  Yeah, when everything went down.  I was stuck in Jersey on the set of a TV show.  Uh-huh.  And they put us up in these hotels, and I actually wound up sharing a hotel with an  extra hot chick.  Uh-huh.  And she wouldn't let me...  I wish it was the fucking Marriott. 
[02:53:00]  Go local for everybody.  No, I'm joking.  I didn't do anything.  All right.  No?  No.  Let's get the answer out there.  What is everyone saying on Pal Talk?  Not gay or gay yet?  Uh, not gay.  This has to be not gay.  It's so not gay.  Let me get the Am I Gay music back on.  Uh, Jamie, what you're describing isn't anal sex.  It's a form of frottage or sexual stimulation by rubbing, in this case, against your butt cheeks. 
[02:53:30]  Some guys like to rub their dick between a woman's breasts, thighs, or feet, and even  a woman's armpit.  Axolism.  Yeah.  It's called axolism.  Is it?  One of my...  Yeah.  Not one of my fetishes, but one of my favorite fetishes to talk about because it's so fucking  weird.  Mm.  It was in my fetish book.  I like that.  Mm.  I like eating an armpit like a pussy.  I don't know why your boyfriend gets off so much, uh, at this.  Uh, maybe he likes the feeling better than vaginal intercourse. 
[02:54:00]  Or maybe your ass just really turns him on.  However, it doesn't mean he's gay.  Even if he liked to penetrate you anally, that would not make him gay.  A lot of straight men, and even some straight women, enjoy anal sex.  There you go.  Yeah.  There's nothing about, um, rubbing your cock on any part of a woman.  Of course not.  That makes you gay.  Of course not.  All right.  Where's, uh, get Sam in here to read one.  But Bobby, why don't we go to you for the next one?  Right. 
[02:54:30]  This one?  Yeah.  Fuck.  We're just going around the room, I swear to God.  I swear to God.  You fucking picked a quick winner for me, didn't you?  Yeah.  Oh, what do you got?  A bad one?  Oh, Jesus.  This is a bad one.  I once checked out some gay porn, and now when I masturbate, I come way harder when I think  of gay porn.  Wow.  Yet I have no physical attraction to desire to be with a man.  I am happily married and very much enjoy the sex with my wife. 
[02:55:00]  Am I gay?  Jim Norton from Manhattan.  Wow, I would say you're gay.  I would say, if you're jerking off.  To gay porn.  To gay porn.  Uh, that's gay.  I would call that gay.  The gay is before the word porn.  All right, what if...  It's pretty much gay porn.  Right.  What if, like, the guy in the gay porn looked like Sam? 
[02:55:30]  That's not gay, because Sam is very girl-like.  Yeah, that'd be cute.  Very twinkish.  I mean, although the hair is, uh, once they grow hair, it's over.  No, we braided the hair.  I have some masculine qualities.  Yeah, name one.  Strong jawbone?  No.  Yeah, if you want to put cum on it, so.  All right, what's the answer, Bobby?  No, you're not gay. 
[02:56:00]  Get the fuck, this website sucks.  Wait a minute, you might be by...  Okay.  ...if you gave it a chance.  But, if you're not really interested or curious, and you're not satisfied with your sex life with your spouse...  And you're satisfied with your sex life with your spouse.  There's no real reason to experiment and find out.  Of course, if you keep jacking off to the thoughts of gay sex, you probably are going to get a little curious about what it's like at that point.  So, you may or may not like it in real life. 
[02:56:30]  So, don't do anything that's going to jeopardize your marriage, suck a fat cock.  If you and your wife have the sort of relationship where you talk about these things, tell her about your fantasies.  Yeah, that's going to go over good.  Yeah.  Hey, listen, I was thinking about fucking taking it in the ass and sucking and swallowing load.  What do you think about that, honey?  And maybe you can watch gay porn together.  Get the fuck out of here.  If I ever told my wife, hey, baby, I want to watch Sam fucking Travis. 
[02:57:00]  I have a video of that.  That's what I'm thinking, too.  How do you get that done?  Yeah.  What are you...  No!  Your wife's going to be fucking you with one eye open?  Like, ugh.  Am I gay?  I watched meat spin until I felt like I was seasick.  Until I...  Until my eyes were spinning in my head.  Until I came and it shot into my own mouth.  By accident.  All right, let's go to Sam.  And by eye, I mean the guy that I was with. 
[02:57:30]  You can't watch fucking porn.  How do you even...  Did you imagine going to Lindsay?  Lindsay, can I talk to you?  Hell fucking no.  Yeah, sure.  What's up?  That's nuts.  She would laugh at me.  Little gay porno.  All right, let's go to Sam.  Sam gets the next one.  Here's your gay music.  I got it right here, Sam.  Here you go, baby doll.  If you're jacking...  The last one on the page.  The gay porn.  The real short one.  If you're watching...  If you're jacking a gay porn.  You can watch gay porn...  As a goof?  As a goof.  For like three seconds.  Yeah, we were all in the office that one day. 
[02:58:00]  Watching gay porn, laughing our asses off.  Because nothing funnier than seeing a guy's dick in another guy's ass.  This is...  Let me tell you something.  The difference between gay porn and fucking straight porn...  Gay guys...  They're like literally cumming machines.  They just...  He's sucking the cock the exact way you need to suck it to make it cum.  There's no cute licks and little cute eye things.  Do you like that, baby?  Girls make it sexy and hot and desirable. 
[02:58:30]  Guys just open their mouth, close their lips around their teeth the perfect way, and they  just fuck a face.  Is that the perfect way, Bobby?  Yeah.  That's what I learned.  No worries.  All right, let's go to Sam.  I like sticking large objects in my rectum, but have never had a boyfriend.  I find men attractive, but have never dated one. 
[02:59:00]  I don't have a girlfriend either.  Am I gay?  Yeah, you faggot.  The response is...  Wait, come over here and read the response on my lap.  I don't want to.  What?  Yeah, you might as well, Sam.  You're comfortable under the table.  Get over here.  It's for the show.  You know that.  It sucks.  It's not for the show.  It's for us.  Get over here.  Right on this little knee right here, Sam Bones.  Put that little bony ass right...  Ugh. 
[02:59:30]  I wanted to feel the bone.  Get in the middle.  Ah!  The response is...  I just sit on Bobby's lap.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bob's rocking me.  The response is...  Yes, you're gay.  Find yourself a boyfriend to help you insert those large objects.  You'll have more fun.  Like a little jar.  Sam's asshole got fucking nervous.  Was it puckering?  I felt it getting nervous. 
[03:00:00]  He had a shy eye.  I like girls.  What?  Yeah, do you?  All right, should we move on to the next one?  Jesus Christ.  What other one?  Do you?  These are fucked, man.  Come on.  I'm just saying all gay.  Danny, we don't have time to do all these.  Which ones are really good?  Yeah, I'm trying to...  Take a quick look.  One, maybe two more of these.  You want to do a few short ones?  I'd like to read a personal one. 
[03:00:30]  I don't care.  If the long one is funny, I don't care.  Just give me the best of the best.  Can I read a personal one from my own diary later in the show?  Sure.  And you can answer and tell me if it's gay or not?  Of course.  Thanks.  This could lead to a round of gay or funny, by the way, for the people out there.  This guy sounds like a treat.  They're all good.  I know.  They're all fucking funny.  Should I just do the next one?  I'm a 35-year-old male and having no trouble meeting women and having sex with them, which I enjoy very much. 
[03:01:00]  I have fantasies about other men giving me anal sex.  I don't ever think I could go through with having sex with another man, though, because men actually turn me off.  I just like anal sex to the point that I use a dildo on myself.  What does this mean?  Jim in Texas.  That's got to be gay.  I'd say gay.  The dildo looks like a peenie. 
[03:01:30]  Like a dick.  Maybe if it looks like something else, maybe not.  I don't know.  What if the dildo doesn't have veins and a helmet?  It's just smooth and glassy.  Like you're sitting on a shower nozzle.  It's too close to looking like a penis.  I mean, if you were able to put a block in your ass, then maybe not gay because it doesn't look like the melt thing.  A block.  Like a square dildo. 
[03:02:00]  If you get a square dildo.  That's what I'm going to say.  Not gay.  How about a hammer handle?  If you could put Lego pieces in your asshole, you're not gay.  There you go.  Or little trophies and stuff.  That's what I don't understand about lesbians.  They hate the dick, but their strap-ons and their belts and stuff, they're using the dick.  Yeah, and not just the dick.  You would think the lesbian community at this point would have figured out some new, like, shape.  Yeah. 
[03:02:30]  That makes it go, look, see, we want to fill up our vaginas with fullness, but we don't want it to look like a penis.  It's a dick that's shaped like a vagina and it's a changed purse.  You know what I mean?  If you don't like dick and you're a lesbian, why are you using something that looks just like a dick?  I never understood that.  I understand there's not many options out there, but there's got to be something you could do to that to totally take away from the fact that it looks like a penis.  Thank you.  Maybe they, like, buy a blow-up doll and scissor with it. 
[03:03:00]  Scissor.  Scissoring is the stupidest thing ever.  Scissoring, it just looks silly.  Fucking fucks me.  Scissoring, you fucking mushing.  Suction together.  Just mushing your vaginas together.  I was fucking plungers going at it.  I was having a conversation yesterday about scissoring and how ridiculous it is.  Yeah.  And then I started wondering if I could find a picture of guys scissoring.  Oh my god.  What?  Did you?  So I really hope no one ever looks for anything on my computer.  You found it?  Well, no, it's just that if you type in, like, the letter G, it's going to come up, like, guys, gay guys scissoring. 
[03:03:30]  Well, what's your email address in case somebody finds one?  Fucking mushing hot balls together.  Let's say hi to Kirsten from San Diego.  Kirsten.  Hey.  Hey, Kirsten.  How are you?  Good.  I just wanted to comment because a lot of guys really like anal stimulation.  It doesn't have to be gay, whether the dildo looks like a penis or not. 
[03:04:00]  Can I ask you?  We've lost this argument over the years, too.  We're like, that's fucked up, and the guys will call until Ron and Fez and say, man, there's nothing gay about it.  I like a little something something going on there.  Can I ask you something?  I know what's going on with my butthole.  Can I ask you?  What's her name?  Kirsten.  Kirsten, can I ask you a question?  And now it's destroying the furniture in this place.  Right, right, exactly.  I mean, fuck. 
[03:04:30]  I've had a few opportunities where, and I'm like, because I know what is going on there.  I'm like, I'm not going to put you through that.  I've had opportunities where mine was so bad.  Norton was in the other room.  He'll tell you the story.  All she heard was, and then the way that she heard this, her trying to get whatever was in her mouth out, and she almost puked.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah.  It was great.  But let me ask you a question, Christian.  Do you think it's gay if while you're eating my asshole, I look down at you and go, yeah, eat my pussy, bitch? 
[03:05:00]  If I refer to my asshole as my pussy.  As your man pussy.  That's a little weird.  What if you say man pussy?  Yeah, my man pussy, my fat lips.  And then you call her like Mike.  I think eating ass is totally something.  I mean, it feels good.  That is a stimulating sexual spot for anybody.  What if I need you to shape your tongue like a fucking cock and mush it out of my ass while sticking your other thumb in my mouth while I suck it? 
[03:05:30]  Jesus, Bobby, you're so gay, Bobby.  Jesus.  I still don't think it's gay.  I think it's just a sexually stimulating spot.  I mean, think about anal beads.  That is a pleasure thing for men, mostly.  Oh, my.  Because that prostate is just so sensitive, and it feels so good.  Okay, so what if you, instead of anal beads, you used like rope from a ship? 
[03:06:00]  With those discs that keep the rats from crawling up.  Would that be bad?  And the rats.  Ow.  Okay, what if you came in the room, right?  And I had your high heels on, and I was holding the high heels and spreading my asshole apart,  and I drew with a Sharpie like vagina lips around my asshole.  Would that be gay? 
[03:06:30]  For you or for me?  For you.  For me.  Oh.  For both of us.  Oh, by the way, Sam, you're officially gay, because you did the dildo in the mouth thing.  Sorry, buddy.  That is true.  You suck that thing.  Oh, my God.  You didn't see the pictures?  No.  Sorry about that.  Oh, fuck.  Pop those pics up, because you're going to shoot a load in your pants when you see the  way this kid sucks a cock.  Where was the question about swallowing dildos?  I'm going to help Sam out. 
[03:07:00]  You might skate on this.  What the fuck?  I was told to.  By who?  Opie.  Really?  If he told you to jump off a bridge, would you suck a dick and then do it?  I was wondering where you're going with that.  Can I just say something?  Doesn't he have good technique?  Listen to me, dude.  I'm not even fucking joking around.  I love watching girls give head.  I love.  And I love, because I can tell if a girl gives good head by the way her fucking mouth is.  Wow.  And the fact that his mouth is, his lips, his upper lip is curved in a little bit. 
[03:07:30]  What?  To protect this fake dick from teeth scraping.  Those treacherous teeth.  And his eyes are shut.  And his cheeks are sucked in.  Would you ever close your eyes if you were sucking a cock, Anthony?  No, I'd want to look right into either the eyes of the man or his pubic mouth.  What the fuck do you think?  Look at.  I'd be shutting my fucking eyes.  But would you shut them softly like this, faggot?  They're not shut softly.  Whatever the prisoner is telling me to do so he doesn't put a shank in my neck. 
[03:08:00]  Because that's the only way I'm sucking a dick.  If you were sucking a cock.  And I'm going to be beat up.  Whatever makes him happier there, Bobby.  If you were sucking a cock, you'd squint your eyes.  They'd just be wrinkled up.  This faggot looks like a dead fairy.  Look, he was doing it for the radio show.  Leave him alone.  Leave me alone.  They're just softly shut.  That's telling him in a masculine way.  All right.  I got the answer.  Leave me alone.  I got the answer to that question I read a while ago at this point. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, this is the one where the guy uses the dildo on himself.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Jim.  Hold on.  Hold on.  It means...  Go ahead, Bobby.  I just...  There's more photos.  Oh, yeah.  But they get worse as they go along.  Why is Travis taking a ton of pictures?  Why is it worse?  Because one...  How about better?  All right, God.  This is fucking...  The fact that you're just sucking on the helmet makes me want to puke.  Because it's not you.  All right.  Here's the question to the guy with the dildos and his own ass. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  Uh, Jim, it means...  Whoa, I got...  We gotta put the music on.  Yeah, you gotta put the music on.  That's a fucking career saver.  Jim, it means you like getting fucked in the ass.  But that in itself doesn't say a whole lot.  Plenty of men who are not gay enjoy taking it up the butt.  Some use dildos on themselves.  And some have their lady friends peg them with strap-ons.  A lot of them never have sex with men.  So if you can find a woman willing to strap it on and go to town on your ass, 
[03:09:30]  you can have all the anal sex you want without having to get near another guy.  The fact that you fantasize about sex with men indicates you probably have some bisexual tendencies.  But if you're not really attracted to guys, maybe those tendencies aren't very strong.  On the other hand, maybe you just haven't met the right guy.  On to the next question.  Oh yeah, this is a party dude. 
[03:10:00]  Wow, this guy sounds like everyone you want at a tailgate party.  And I know this guy.  Yeah, yeah.  I think everybody knows this guy.  Everyone knows one of these guys?  Yeah.  Alright, if everyone knows this guy, we could answer a question today.  Because I'm sure a lot of people are wondering if that guy they know is gay or not.  You know who I think should read this, though?  Huh?  Tank Hankerous.  He's sick.  Tank Hankerous went home sick.  He threw up in the parking lot.  Too much jizzing in his belly.  He actually threw up.  E-Rock threw up.  Yeah.  He texted me and he said, he's finally full.  He said, what happened? 
[03:10:30]  No, he was just making room for lunch.  Take that fat so I know you're still listening to us.  You obsessed fan that works for this show.  What the fuck is this, Lord of the Rings?  Holy shit.  Stupid E-Rock.  Right.  I got it.  I have a question.  I like to go out and party.  When I do, sometimes I end up dropping my pants. 
[03:11:00]  It doesn't matter if it's a football tailgate party, a bar, or a house party.  I just enjoy showing my package.  What I can understand is that I get really excited when my guy friends look at my groin  area.  Get the fuck out of here.  You know, it isn't like they stare, but even the slightest glance by a dude makes the hairs  on my neck stand up.  Am I just an exhibitionist or am I gay? 
[03:11:30]  P.S.  I also have a cat.  It has to be gay.  I would say if you're getting off in any way, shape, or form at showing your dick to  your friends, your guy friends.  You could do it for the shock value and the goof, but if you're getting excited because  they're glancing down a little bit.  What if you have low self-esteem and that's the only attention and positivity you get? 
[03:12:00]  Like, you take your cock out and if you look at it and go, wow, and I see you looking  at it like, ah, you respect it.  No, it's you, though.  If you're getting turned on sexually by guys looking at your dick, you're gay.  If you're whipping your dick out and just going, look at my fucking dick, you sorry son of  a bitch.  Right.  Then that's not gay.  That's just boasting.  So if I took my dick out and I saw you looking at it.  Yeah.  And then that turned me on.  Right.  That's gay.  You're so fucking gay. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're next to each other at the urinal.  You peek over and get a little harder.  You're squirting that piss a little further.  Actually, in my own face.  Yeah.  I'm drinking it.  It's hitting your chin.  It's like a fucking Caesar's Palace fountain.  Evil Knievel tried to jump it.  So, by the way, Bobby, did you say Lord of the Rings instead of Lord of the Flies?  No, I was talking about your, I did say that, but I had nothing to do with that. 
[03:13:00]  That new intern, that new intern that walked in looked like a fucking hobbit.  Oh, okay.  Have you seen him?  I don't know which one, so.  Go ahead, Amy.  What's the answer?  The answer is, dear Anonymous, because he was anonymous in Oklahoma, you're a gay exhibitionist.  Well, maybe not gay, but you're definitely an exhibitionist.  Are you gay because you like attention from other men?  It's very possible.  Most straight male exhibitionists get off on exposing themselves to women. 
[03:13:30]  There may be other reasons that it excites you to have another guy check out your goods.  Maybe it's just an ego thing, but it seems pretty sexual.  So, you're probably gay or bi, especially since you have a cat.  Or a small dog named Dexter?  What?  Oh, boy.  All right, let me, real quick, read the next one.  It's fast.  A lot of times after the show, I like to watch gay porn all the time. 
[03:14:00]  P.S.  I came in my own face a few weeks ago.  Am I gay?  Derek B.  In New York City.  Wow, Derek.  Jeez.  Derek B.  Derek B.  Why would you cum in your face?  I don't know.  Because you're probably gay.  Probably gay.  Probably like the taste or something.  You want cum in your face.  And then why would you tell all your co-workers about it the next day?  Yeah, you must be gay.  Wow, you know a lot about this letter.  Almost like you couldn't wait to tell all your friends, hey, you got some of your own cum in your face. 
[03:14:30]  Just in case you want to move on to the next step, someone else has cum in your face.  Hey, you know, I had no problem with cum in my face.  He's just throwing that fishing line in the water.  Yeah, that's what it was.  One of us goes, really, tell me more.  He was chumming with his own cum.  I think we're going to need a bigger cock.  It wasn't even like speaking of which.  It was a complete non-sequitur.  It's like, hey, you think this bed would be good for something?  And he's just like, oh. 
[03:15:00]  I came in my own face the other day.  Dude.  I walked in when we came from CBS that day, and the first time I see Derek, he's like,  came in my face last night.  Derek's fucking insane, by the way.  He certainly is.  He comes off like a regular guy, but you spend ten minutes with him and you realize he's fucking insane.  And gay.  And really gay.  I got an inch of my, like maybe a little less than an inch of my cock in my own mouth once. 
[03:15:30]  What?  No way.  Absolutely.  How'd you do that?  I fucking bounced on the back of my neck in the tub.  You had to flip my legs over my head.  And just the top of my cock got in my mouth.  Sure was yours.  It's like, I think I'm doing this.  Some guy's going, yeah, keep sucking.  Hang on a little.  You're doing a great job sucking your own cock.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  We were going to end this, but there's two ways. 
[03:16:00]  This one's ridiculous.  Earlier this year.  Anthony, you can listen to this one.  Anthony gets second zone cock right now.  Oh, I wish.  Don't even bend over.  Earlier this year.  Let me get this on the air because this one is just a treat for everybody.  Earlier this year, I went on a fishing trip with the guys and my father-in-law.  No music?  Shh.  It doesn't hear.  This is a test of the emergency alert system.  This is only a test. 
[03:16:30]  This is a coordinated monthly test for Sirius XM radio.  Equipment that can quickly warn you during emergencies is being tested.  If this had been an actual national emergency, official messages would have followed the alert tone. 
[03:17:00]  This concludes this test of the emergency alert system.  Hand job and fingering your ass.  You've got bigger problems to worry about than whether or not you're gay.  I can imagine what your family dinners with the in-laws are like.  This situation cannot possibly end well.  It's like when fucking Kramer burnt down the log cabin with the cigars. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, my God.  These letters, he's more of a man.  We went into emergency alert system.  Yeah, I just heard that myself.  What?  What?  What did they miss?  What happened?  Are we back?  Are we back?  I don't perform for three people.  Well, I performed for a million, so let me know when we're back.  I don't even acknowledge these people.  Are we back?  Are we back?  We're back.  What did they miss?  Better than air, but we're back.  Take it off the air.  This is a test of the emergency alert system. 
[03:18:00]  What did we miss there, people?  Help me out.  This is only a test.  And what did we miss?  Did they know on PalTalk?  That was a good one.  Where did we leave off?  I don't know.  But they get to hear.  Oh.  Excited.  Last we heard was what?  No music.  The whole thing they lost?  Yeah.  I ain't fucking reading that again.  I will.  I will.  I will.  All right, Bobby.  I want to read it from the bathroom.  All right, Bobby.  Why don't you read the one?  Because this was...  They didn't get any of this?  I'm not sure. 
[03:18:30]  I'm still working on that.  This is a hot one.  This is a sexy one.  Where is it?  Where is it, Sam?  Help me out.  Where did we leave off?  It's Gordon there.  All right, here we go.  I got it.  Just read it fast again.  Early this year, I went on a fishing trip with the guys and my father-in-law.  One night, we all got kind of drunk.  My father-in-law suggested we strip poker.  Before we knew, we were all nude.  Went to bed that night, and later, my father-in-law crawled into bed with me, and I pretended I was  passed out. 
[03:19:00]  He started to give me a handjob.  After that, he slowly massaged my anus.  Again, I pretended I was passed out.  I really, really enjoyed this.  Am I gay, Gordon, from Minnesota?  Wow, they missed the whole story, I just found out.  Now we got it on because of Bobby.  All right, Bobby, what was the answer?  The answer is, if your wife's father's crawling into bed naked with you, giving you a handjob  and figuring your asshole, you've got bigger problems to worry about than whether you're 
[03:19:30]  gay or not.  I can imagine what your family dinners with the in-laws are like.  This situation cannot possibly end well.  I'd love to go camping.  Can you read this really short one from Brad in NYU?  Brad.  To reach into the register, Brad, give me my money back.  Last night, I gave my friend a handjob for not even five minutes. 
[03:20:00]  Am I gay?  Brad, NYU.  Last night, I gave my friend a handjob for not even five minutes.  That's gay, right?  No.  That's not gay.  The joke's on him, right?  The joke's on him.  Look, here, listen to my little analogy.  You walk into a bank to rob it.  Right. 
[03:20:30]  You pull a gun out.  It takes five minutes to get all the money.  Right.  You just robbed the fucking bank.  You're a bank robber.  What if you don't take the money?  You walk in.  It takes 20 minutes.  What if the guy...  You're a fucking bank robber.  What if the guy didn't make a deposit?  What if you don't take the money?  You took the money.  What if you say...  You robbed the bank.  Or a withdrawal.  Check it out.  You go, stick him up.  Yeah.  And then you go, ah, I'm just kidding.  I'm kidding.  And you put the gun away and lose.  Then you're an attempted faggot.  You're committing attempted faggot. 
[03:21:00]  He's not gay.  He's an attempted faggot.  What does this website say, Ed?  Well, it says, relax.  Touching a dick for five minutes will not turn you gay.  One hand job will not turn you gay.  Do you still like girls?  Then you're not gay.  You still like girls, but you enjoy touching a dick and would do it again?  Then maybe you're bi.  You never really like girls and you're secretly hoping your friend asks for a blowjob next time? 
[03:21:30]  Okay, you're probably gay.  So he kind of left the balls in his clothes and the dick in his mouth.  What if it's just your consistency freak?  We should add right there.  Well, the next one, it's short and it's kind of good.  All right.  Bobby, read or ask, who wants to read the last one?  Sam does a good job.  Yeah, Sam, read it.  Sam, go ahead.  You got it?  They're all so good.  Which one do you get on?  This one last one is, my boyfriend claims he's straight.  Oh, it's from Jess.  My boyfriend claims he's straight, but I found emails to other men on his computer. 
[03:22:00]  He blames it on the fact that he's stressed out and it was a fantasy and the act itself of being with another man made him sick.  Is he gay or bi?  Anonymous in Arizona.  It was fantasy.  Oh, the act of it.  Yeah, you know, I've been stressed out.  The first thing I do, I start just dropping emails to guys.  Yeah, hit the porn zone.  I've done it too, dude.  Seriously. 
[03:22:30]  Especially during April, like when tax seasons, I'm just fucking typing away.  I'm so stressed.  You know what's fucked up about Bobby?  You're trying to defend every single question in this bit.  Yeah, I'm going to defend these guys.  It's not gay.  Yeah, I've never been with a woman.  I just like dicks in my ass.  Am I gay?  I'm going to fart again.  Not me.  I think Bobby's trying to hold out to the fact that he might just be bi.  But learning today that he's losing that.  I just remember that when a girl was knuckling my asshole, how good that felt. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, but according to what we read and according to past phone calls, that's not gay.  Not gay.  Not gay.  Not gay.  When you're begging her to fuck your pussy.  See, that's gay.  When you're saying fuck my pussy.  No.  That's not, that doesn't mean no.  That's fucking gay.  That would mean no, because for me to be gay, I would have to be a guy wanting to.  You are.  You're a lesbian.  I'm calling it a, I'm a lesbian.  It's not a pussy.  It's your fucking man asshole.  I would be more of a lesbian than I would a fag. 
[03:23:30]  I think you're a lesbian.  Because I'm calling it a pussy.  Yeah.  Maybe back when you had breasts.  Can you imagine that?  It's a past fat joke.  Yeah, we like the past fat jokes.  The guy who fast times originally, it's a past fat joke.  It's a past fat joke.  Listen to me.  You never had your asshole eaten?  You're right.  You're fucking gay?  Yeah.  No, I've never.  Look at me.  Look at me and say it.  I've never had my asshole eaten.  You're smiling.  Why are you smiling? 
[03:24:00]  I don't.  Because you're looking at me like you want to fucking say you want it eaten?  Hey, Obie, have you ever had your asshole eaten?  You're lying.  This motherfucker.  God damn.  I've never seen somebody break down that quick.  This motherfucker broke down.  It's like, did you see how fast he broke down?  This cock's highway.  I'm never going to do a crime with Obie because he'll crack in two seconds.  Did you guys rob that? 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, no.  No.  Yes, we did.  We did.  I've had my asshole eaten, too.  Do we have another live read?  Yeah.  Hey, Danny.  Danny, have you ever had your asshole?  Yes.  Really?  Yeah.  Recently?  Nah.  Recently.  Now?  In the past two days, three.  Have you ever had it eaten when it's just dirty and hot and wet?  When isn't it?  When is a man's ass not dirty?  You know, you've got to scrub a dub dub, that fucking thing.  And even then, it's like.  Dear Am I Gay, my asshole is perfectly gay.  Am I gay? 
[03:25:00]  Yes, you are.  You're not a man.  I had two situations.  I had one where this girl went down to eat my ass.  She used to put me on all fours and a pillow under my stomach.  Jesus Christ.  Fucking Lamaze class.  And she went down to eat my ass.  It was a hot, hot summer day.  Hot.  Hot.  And she went to eat my ass.  And she went down, took a couple swipes, and then went like that and slapped my ass.  She went like this. 
[03:25:30]  Go wash your ass, honey.  It stinks.  Of course.  I ran in and scrapped my ass.  Trying to get the smell out of your ass is like trying to wash your hands after handling an onion.  You just.  No matter what you do.  I think it's okay for a few seconds.  Right.  But then that onion will come back.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, let's get the fuck out of this bit.  Very funny, Bobby.  We got to do some porn.com shit right now.  This is perfect.  We should just seg right into porn.com. 
[03:26:00]  Of course.  That's what it's all about.  If you're stressed out and looking for gay porn, let me tell you something, people.  If you're not sure if you want to jerk off to some gay porn or not, give it a shot.  Porn.com.  If you're stressed and you need your gay porn, go to porn.com.  I mean, they're saying 45 different categories.  You got to think one of the big ones is the gay category.  I don't think I've ever been to a porn site that has categories that doesn't have a gay site.  Plus, porn.com is all there.  You can go and start going at straight porn, and then when you realize you're kind of getting into it, 
[03:26:30]  just kind of click over to the gay porn area.  There's so many different areas.  That's all I'm saying.  By accident.  Jesus.  Jesus, Sam.  It's just different places to click.  I like, here's what I like.  I like amateur the best.  That's my favorite.  Not fake amateur.  A little voyeur stuff.  Voyeur, not too much so, because I like the person being photographed or videotaped,  knowing they're being photographed or videotaped, but I like the amateur thing.  Money shots after blowjobs. 
[03:27:00]  Those are good.  The blowjob fucking money shot.  Fantastic porn.  That's good stuff.  Sometimes if you're jacking, you could time it, like, to come when the guy comes in the movie,  so it's almost like you're coming on the chick's face.  So you like to come with the guy?  Yeah, yeah.  Get it all over me.  And wash all that delicious cum.  I just wish the girl would leave the fucking frame.  And sometimes I like to come in my own face.  Hi, I'm Derek P. 
[03:27:30]  Did you ever fuck up the timing of the fucking jerk-off when you're trying to come with the guy?  Because you want to, when she goes, ah, yeah.  And she opens her mouth, cum in my face.  And then he comes, and then you hold it two seconds, and then you're cumming off key.  Too long.  And you're trying to cum with it, but it doesn't happen.  Yeah.  And then you're cumming to his face.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, oh.  Like, ah, now get out of here.  Then your whole jerk-off was ruined, and then you just said, I just came to a guy.  Yeah.  Ruined?  And it's wrecked. 
[03:28:00]  Nah, because then you tried to hold back, but you couldn't all the way, so it came out,  but not with that boost.  Yeah, that boost of, oh my.  That perfect timing.  Yeah, that first.  That only you can jerk off like.  That first rogue load that shoots out.  Rogue load.  Fucking snaps and hits the wall.  A rogue load.  That one's just used to clear the tube.  Yeah, that's just.  Yeah.  Fire a blast to clear the tube, and then load a torpedo.  Right.  Then you just kill.  The rest of the load just keeps overflowing over your knuckles like a fucking lava. 
[03:28:30]  A lava fucking volcano.  Just keeps going over and over your knuckles.  What's wrong with you?  Strudelizing.  Then you spider-man it right in her face.  What the fuck?  Just flip it.  Porn.com.  Sure.  Nice.  Yeah.  I'm going to go home today.  Largest collection of adult scenes, photos, full-length DVDs on the net today, including  almost 17,000 porn stars.  Wow. 
[03:29:00]  Wow.  Porn.com is your horny new homepage.  For instance, recession relief.  Mm-hmm.  Yes, size matters.  When it comes to selection, porn.com is huge.  Mm-hmm.  In fact, so big, take you over, guess how long it would take you to watch everything  on porn.com?  42 seconds.  I wouldn't...  No, no.  I don't mean like when you come and then shut it off.  Oh, okay.  I would guess you would have to leave some for your ancestors.  Well...  Your ancestors would have to take over where you left off.  Uh, yeah.  In certain cases, I think you're right, because it's saying here 15 years... 
[03:29:30]  Wow.  ...to watch everything on there.  Yeah, but what if you're not into the gay porn on porn.com?  14 years, nine months.  There's three months of steady gay watching.  There's three months of gay?  Yes.  What if you're only into gay and fucking horse porn?  How long would that take?  I don't know if there's horse porn there.  Yeah, that would be illegal.  I don't think so.  That's highly illegal.  Okay.  So gay and jerking off into Japanese newscasters' face porn.  How long would that take?  Right?  I'm sure they have some kind of Asian. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  A lot of guys are into that.  Right.  I don't know, though.  I got to go to porn.  When I go to porn.com, I go to my categories, the ones I like.  Amateur.  I like potpourri.  What?  Potent potables.  What is that?  What is that?  What about a black on...  Jeopardy category.  What about a black on white thing?  Oh, yeah.  They got a lot of that.  Do you like that?  No.  You must love that.  I didn't like yesterday.  You think I'm going to like singing fucking...  It's like, slow down.  Some lily white chick take a big black cock? 
[03:30:30]  It's like, slow down.  Do you think I want to see that?  I think the Obamas had sex in the White House last night.  They fucked the shit out of each other.  They were a little tired, but the adrenaline gets up.  What do you think?  Main bedroom?  Lincoln bedroom?  Fucking Lincoln bedroom.  They fucked the shit out of porn.com.

How would your ancestors jerk off to porn?  Unless, of course, they got into a DeLorean.  Yeah, if they had a DeLorean.  Then they could do it.  Do they have ghost porn? 
[03:31:30]  Jack off.  Do they have ghost porn?  They'd need plutonium, too.  Boo.  Ah, boo.  Bobby, what are you doing?  Because we're going to read early.  Hey, did you hear, by the way, that old Biff that was in the DeLorean was actually fading  away and dying when he came out of that fucking thing?  Well, that's why he's in so much pain.  He's in pain when he walks out.  Yeah, and I remember being a kid.  He fucked up his history.  Yeah.  So when he came back, he didn't exist.  He didn't exist.  So he's going to disappear.  Yeah.  I always wondered that, watching that as a kid, I was like, what was he doing? 
[03:32:00]  I thought he was like, I thought maybe he was having like a heart attack or he couldn't  deal with like time travel or something like that.  Time travel, the stresses of it or something like that.  But that's why the cane is found in the DeLorean.  That's how they knew that Biff went back because when Biff broke his cane, he was actually in  the process of fading out of existence.  Fading away.  He should have been fading then, not clutching his chest.  Well, I think it was that whole thing like, you know, when Michael J. Fox was playing  guitar.  That's Marty.  Marty.  And he's like grabbing and stuff, you know.  Yeah.  He's in pain. 
[03:32:30]  That's true.  It's kind of a painful thing when you fade out of existence.  What if you suck a guy's cock in the future, get into a DeLorean and come back?  Are you gay?  You never suck the cock.  Yeah.  Not gay.  You can change that.  Wow.  But you could, you might set up some kind of alternate gay reality.  Yeah.  If you go in the past and suck a dick.  So you're fucked.  You're just going to come back and just a queen.  Because then you're coming back and all history will change.  You're going to come back in a bed, thin, with no hair.  Yeah, with a poodle and some fucking broth. 
[03:33:00]  This back to the future discussion was brought to you by DirecTV.  Yes.  Call 888-961-DIREC-TV.  Uh-huh.  Actually, DirecTV, one T.  Yeah.  888-961-DIREC-TV for DirecTV.  Yes.  Bobby, what do you got going on?  Are you guys in Chicago?  Uh, wow.  Yeah, right now.  Thanks for making us feel good.  What about Cleveland?  People are listening in Chicago.  What about Philly?  Yes.  What about Boston?  Everything.  All X-Amers. 
[03:33:30]  All right.  Well, I'm going to be at the Chicago Improv.  Nice.  Yeah, that's the 26th and the 1st.  Nice.  That's through the 1st.  I'm there for a fucking month, apparently.  Nice.  Goddamn age and stinks.  To me, you know you're not famous when you have to do Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,  Saturday, and Sunday.  It's called the job.  Yeah, I know.  Holy shit.  I actually have to help sell tickets during the day, too.  I'll be answering the phones at the Improv in Chicago.  Fuck me.  You were in Ghost Town.  Ah, yeah, I know.  I was a ghost, just like my real life fucking asshole. 
[03:34:00]  And they can go vote for me on Stand Up, the thing, Stand Up Kelly, 66333.  Yeah, cool.  Bobby, thanks, man.  Thank you, man.  Yeah, it's always a pleasure to have Bobby in.  Always fun.  Very natural, you know?  It's not like you've got to fit you in here and you don't know what's going on like some  people.  It just works.  You guys are nice.  You guys are very nice.  Lost tonight, if you're a Lost fan, I know I would have been thankful for a reminder 
[03:34:30]  I set my alarm on my iPhone, so it will go off before the recap, and then what's lost?  And I'm sure Travis will text me.  How long would it take me to get caught up?  15 years.  I'm not even joking.  I haven't seen one.  You would have to do a marathon.  How long would the marathon take?  For real?  How many seasons are we up to?  Season four.  18 per year.  A lot of episodes.  They do about 18 a year? 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  18, 36.  Yeah.  At least 54 have to go through?  How long did it take you to watch?  54 hours?  How long was the wire?  Wire rolled, though.  Figure about that.  Lost rules.  That took a long time.  I was pumping DVDs into my player, and it still took a long time.  You'll do the same thing once you watch Lost.  I like pumping DVDs in my player.  Yeah, no, Lost you're going to get mad at.  Lost, around season three, you're going to get pissed watching it.  No, you get pissed after every episode.  You get pissed, but there's...  Because you're like, ah, now what?  Season three, you're like, what the fuck? 
[03:35:30]  Why the fuck did he say that?  What the fuck?  Why would he do that?  Well, they got to tie up those loose ends.  Like, why talk to each other?  Say, all you have to do is say, hey, dude.  Ben ends up in Tunisia.  Yeah, it's weird.  You know what?  What the fuck?  I think it's too late for me.  No, it's not, dude.  Get into it.  I'm going to have to give up on that one.  Don't do it.  For real.  Don't do it.  I'm going to have to give up on that one.  You watched that fucking pilot episode, though?  No, dude.  You're hooked.  Yeah.  That first episode is the shit.  The plane crash?  Yes.  God.  Because I was just like, I was under the impression when I first watched it that, okay, it's 
[03:36:00]  another fucking, you know, plane crashes on an island.  How are these people going to fucking survive kind of a story?  And then things just get so fucking weird, you just think it's one of those Irwin Allen  type stupid disaster movies.  It's probably, it's like the easiest show I've ever gotten into.  Yeah.  All right, Mr. Genius Guy.  No, no, no.  I'm saying, like, you jump right in.  Oh, you fall into it.  I thought you meant easily understood.  No, no, no, no.  Like, come on, I still don't know what the fucking smoke is.  You'd like it, too, because you have to look in the, you can't just watch the show. 
[03:36:30]  No, you get online.  The shit in the background, all of a sudden you'll notice like a little, like a logo or something  You're online looking at Dharma Initiative fucking plans.  No, it ain't doing no Dharma crap.  Dude, I have a Dharma Initiative smock.  No, you don't.  You're right, I don't.  You better not.  I want a shirt.  Nah, I'm out.  What if I get a doctor smock like the guy has?  Nah, anyone can get that.  You can't.  I want something with Dharma Initiative on.  I want Dharma Initiative beer.  Like, are there booze that just says Dharma Initiative shit on it?  How about the peanut butter? 
[03:37:00]  Sorry, I saw labels that you could print out.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, that you could put around your own beer so you could have Dharma Initiative beer.  Yeah, you could do that.  That's cool.  That's some Dharma Initiative beer.  Dude, Coke Logic helped me out with the math.  Season 1, 25 episodes?  Yeah, they did crank out some episodes.  Season 2, 24.  Season 3, 23.  I'm out.  Fuck that.  Get them online.  You just sit there with the computer and running.  Jerk off to point in between.  72 hours? 
[03:37:30]  Three days.  Yeah, but you figure it's like 43 minutes without the commercials.  No commercials.  You're banging them out right after the other.  Bam, bam, bam.  Fuck that.  Fast voting through the recap.  I watched Lost on DVD the second year.  Somebody told me to watch it.  I was like, fuck you.  They gave me the first season.  I watched from one all the way to the end.  You can't put it down.  Coke Logic is a lost blocker.  You can't fuck yourself.  I'm out.  Good show.  Well, you can always watch 24 then. 
[03:38:00]  I want to be with these guys on this one, but I'm out.  I can't do it.  Fuck that.  Fuck it.  That's too much.  Do it.  Too fucking much.  What are you doing?  You do a radio show.  Yeah, do that.  I...  What else?  Do you have charities you fucking help me?  No, I play four hours of Tiger Woods Golf a day.  Okay.  Although my online is down right now.  That's why people haven't seen me there.  I watched The Biggest Loser.  Why is your online down?  I don't know.  It's in a pretty good building.  Local network.  Something.  Cable.  Oh, no. 
[03:38:30]  They can't figure it out.  Oh, no.  My cable works.  That sucks.  Oh, then it's an internal network problem.  With my stuff, right?  Yeah.  That's what I said.  But the guy came and said it isn't.  Dude, he's full of shit.  If you're getting fucking cable, come on.  It's either your cable modem.  How about a bad modem?  Could be your cable modem.  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  Enough or nothing.  I know what cable service you have, and if a tech came to your house, don't...  The tech is fucking so stupid.  Believe me.  I bet I know who you voted for.  Yeah, exactly.  Dude, they're retarded.  I was having problems, too.  I had a ground loop problem, and I'm telling the guy what the problem is, and he's telling 
[03:39:00]  me, no, no, no, no, no.  He's like, I'll be back in five minutes.  He goes to the store, picks up...  You know those grounding plugs where...  I'll go run and get some cables for you.  So he goes and gets me those plugs that turns the three-prong into the two-prong.  Yeah.  And while that...  Yes, okay, that fixes my problem.  It now alleviates me of a ground.  Yes.  So now all my expensive electronic equipment is now ungrounded.  It isn't grounded.  So it's like, well, thanks for fixing the problem, asshole.  But now all my shit is susceptible.  Well, he rigged it in a certain way where there's a word before it. 
[03:39:30]  That befit him.  Yes, okay.  I've rigged many things like that in my life, but you don't rig the ground.  All right, let's go home.  Ah, you fucking General Motors.  I want to go home.  Taking a shit on me.  I want to go home.  Fucker.  I want to go home.  I knew my timing would fuck up one of these days.  I want to go home.  Sit on this stock now, you piece of shit.  Is that your stock right there?  Yeah.  And it's taking a shit? 
[03:40:00]  Yeah.  General Motors, though, so it's expected.  It's not like I fucking...  I'm surprised.  All right.  It just takes a dump, you know?  I'm going to go home and fucking jerk off to this show.  To Game Boy?  No, to this show.  To this show?  To all of us talking?  Yeah.  Is that weird?  I've been having sex in the past, and then you have Comedy Central on or something, and  it's like, it's Comedy Central with Adam Ferrara.  And there's your friend talking, and you just have to change the fucking channel. 
[03:40:30]  And your dick fills up with an inch figure?  You can't listen.  No, no, no, no.  Is it like Italian guys?  That's it.  Yeah.  You look at Italian guys with weird walks?  No.  I don't want any of my friends in my room, even on television.  It's fucked up.  Patrice pops up in a movie.  Like, ugh.  Degenerous.  As a tranny.  What the fuck here?  Yeah.  Did you see the one where he was in the fucking tranny?  It's great.  God, he's fucking great for taking that.  That's a guy who'll take a part. 
[03:41:00]  He don't care what it is.  He had to beat Norton for that role.  Where is Norton right now?  Miami.  All right.  Let's go home, please.  Yeah, let's get out of here.  All right, everybody.  Great day.  Oh, they're saying it's the router.  Fuck.  It could be your network router.  Just go buy a new router.  Well, if you plug your computer right into your modem, what does it do?  Bypass the router.  Oh, it worked.  Yeah.  What is it?  The router.  So what do I do now?  Buy a new router. 
[03:41:30]  But the router is the inside dude or the cable dude?  You can buy your own.  No, your router.  Yeah, best buy circuit city.  Anything that splits off from it comes out of the modem and then goes into the router.  But do the cable people put in the router?  No.  No, you do.  You plug it in.  But then why didn't the IT guy say it was your router?  Because he's an asshole.  He said it was a cable modem.  To them, it stops at the fucking cable modem.  They don't give a shit.  Unless you have, like me, unless you have your Wi-Fi through the cable network.  He went right to the computer and said, all right, that means it's got to be their issue 
[03:42:00]  and it's got to be a cable modem.  Where do you get your Wi-Fi from?  From somebody in my building.  Oh.  So you're tapping into someone else's mic?  No, but this was my system that he tested out.  Yeah.  Yeah, but do you pay for it through cable?  What's your...  I got a legal cable, Bobby.  All righty.  Why would you ever...  Watch for long.  But, Ope, you said that if you take a Cat 5 cable from the modem right into your computer,  it works?  Yeah.  Then it's totally your router. 
[03:42:30]  Then it's definitely your router.  Motherfucker, I'm going to write that guy right now.  It's so your router.  Not only are we gay, we're fucking nerds, too.  My router's gay.  Fucking gay nerds.  I like putting Cat 5 cables in my ass and telling people that it's their modem.  Dude, I like to take a fucking G wireless modem and shove the antennas in my asshole.  See if I get reception.  Yeah.  I want to see if the interception goes away when it's in my ass and then I pull it out.  I do that with the extenders.  The extenders. 
[03:43:00]  I like to sit on the router all the way down to the actual third light that blinks that  tells you if you have internet connection is good.  Holy shit.  We go home.  Other words, I'm watching those lights and the last one fucks you.  All right.  Got that.  Got that.  Got that.  Now you're blinking fucking cunt.  All right.  Let's get out of here.  Come on.  What are we doing?  I unplugged the router and then waited to replug it in.  It's probably internal settings.  Great.  We'll work this out.  Keep your chin up. 
[03:43:30]  I will.  Thanks, guys.  Robert.  Awesome.  See you guys tomorrow. </pre>
