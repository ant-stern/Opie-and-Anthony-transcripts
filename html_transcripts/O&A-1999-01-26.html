<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with Opie detailing his bout with the flu, while Anthony recounted upgrading his computer to Windows 98, jokingly blaming Microsoft for deliberately introducing bugs in older versions to push upgrades.  They briefly mentioned a Dave Matthews Band concert and Anthony narrowly avoiding hitting a bicycle messenger.  A Priceline.com ad featuring a Bill Shatner impersonation aired.  “Shoot Ed,” a human paintball target, was announced as a Super Bowl party winner, receiving a 53-inch Sony TV with picture-in-picture.

Comedian Adam Ferrara called in to promote his American Comedy Award nomination, mentioning his mother's enthusiastic support. Opie and Anthony shared anecdotes about Ferrara’s comedy and criticized another comedian, Schimmel.  They revisited and expanded upon a previous “Brady Bunch” trivia segment speculating about Mike Brady's hidden sexual activities, using this to qualify more listeners for the Super Bowl party.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a phone interview with sex expert Laura Corn, promoting her books, “52 Invitations to Great Sex” and “101 Nights of Great Romance.”  They discussed various sexual techniques, including the “blue balloon” and “hover” techniques, and launched their “Tuesday Night Hummer Club,” encouraging listeners to engage in oral sex.  A married couple called in live, agreeing to try one of Corn’s techniques and report back, generating excitement from the hosts and Corn.  This segment continued, with Corn providing further sex tips and advice for couples, focusing on enhancing intimacy and sexual satisfaction.  A recurring trivia question, asking listeners to identify a skiing item that enhances female orgasm (the answer was not revealed in this summary), and listener calls followed, some describing successful and unsuccessful attempts at Corn's techniques. Pierre and Monique detailed a highly successful experience with an oral sex technique from “52 Invitations,” while another caller described positive results using an invitation involving a hanger, scarf, vibrator, and candles. Listeners also attempted to guess the top male and female fetishes (a foot fetish was revealed as the top male fetish). Throughout this segment, Opie, Anthony, and Corn engaged in sexually explicit discussions, using vulgar language and describing various sexual acts and techniques.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  1027 WNAW, The Rock of New York, two for Tuesday, David Bowie from Ziggy Stardust, Moon Age, Daydream, and the Gene Genie.  Couple from Rush to get the show going today, it's Opie and Anthony.  Good afternoon. How are you, buddy?  Oh, very good. How are you?  I see something going on with the O-Star.  I don't know.  Alright, wait, close your mouth.  Yeah.  Put your face near the mic.  Inhale through your nose.  Yeah, welcome to the wonderful world of influenza. 
[00:00:30]  Come on. This is bizarre, though.  When you picked me up today, I was fine.  Yeah.  That's how it happens.  By the time we got into NEW, I'm like this.  I got sick of the way in.  It happens that fast.  The bug hit me in between my driveway and the NEW parking lot.  Did you think it wasn't going to happen?  Earl's ready to spray the Lysol.  You can spray it out.  There you go.  Just don't get it in my coffee.  Everyone around here had the flu, right? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  You didn't.  You're in here every day.  Mm-hmm.  It was bound to happen.  It's like you go into the old bathhouses in New York in the 70s and not expecting to get boinked.  Opie.  I was convinced it was going to pass me by, but...  No, no, no.  I guess not.  You're a little sniffly there.  I feel all right.  I'm just getting really stuffed up.  I just hope I don't get the throat thing.  That's how it happens.  You know what happens?  Wait, you started with the nose and then went to the throat? 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Remember I had the cold for a while and I was sneezing like crazy?  Yeah.  And then it turns into this nasal drip thing that goes into your throat and that's where  your throat starts hurting.  And then out of nowhere, boom, fever.  And your eyes feel like they're going to...  Well, I got that already.  Pop out of your head.  I got the burning eyes again.  I had that last week, though, too.  And then when Lisa comes in to give you a back rub, all of a sudden she goes,  Oh, my God, you're hot.  And then you go home and I do the show and I call you from your room. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  I don't think I'm going to make the...  I think I'm out one day this week.  You think?  Yeah.  It's only Tuesday?  I'm starting to feel it.  We'll see.  We'll see how it works.  Hopefully not.  Well, of course.  Because this is my life.  You're healthy.  This is my life right here.  I don't want to stay home.  All right.  We're ready to rock.  Yeah.  I'm in the process of upgrading right now to Windows 98 on the laptop. 
[00:02:30]  So, Opie will be looking at all the instant feedback.  Yes.  I figured I had to give Bill Gates just a couple of more bucks.  Now, why are you...  He was looking a little down in the dump.  Now, you were very happy with your Windows 95.  What is the problem?  Well, Opie, if I may, can I just maybe...  You need a little forum, Anthony?  I'm going to give a little conspiracy theory out here.  I might sound a little crazy, but with the Internet, you never know.  Okay.  Anyway, I had Windows 95 since it came out.  Very happy with it.  Good operating system for me.  It's working well. 
[00:03:00]  Not many bugs.  Occasionally something happens.  That's fine.  You deal with it.  Windows 98 comes out.  I'm thinking, why do I have to upgrade to Windows 98?  Windows 95 treating me fine.  Why screw with something that's working?  I'm still on the net.  I'm cruising the web.  Blah, blah, blah.  All of a sudden, things start going wrong.  What do you mean, going wrong?  Well, programs get buggy.  Screen freezes and stuff.  Screen freeze, crashes.  And I'm hearing Windows 98.  Oh, diagnostics. 
[00:03:30]  It takes care of problems that you have.  It just works better than 95.  I start thinking, boy, this Bill Gates and Microsoft.  You're cruising the web.  Who's to say they're not popping some kind of bugs in on your Windows 95 while you're online to make it screw up so you start going, must buy Windows 98.  And you know something?  It worked. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah?  Because I'm booting up the 98 right now.  You ran out and you got the 98.  So that's my little conspiracy theory.  All right.  I think they're bugging 95 to force you to buy 98.  And just slowly but surely.  Yeah, just enough.  So you don't really notice it at first and just get worse and worse.  It doesn't degrade your confidence in Windows.  See, they can't totally screw it up on you because then you go, ah, there's Windows.  My God.  Just enough that you go, boy, I bet 98 will fix that. 
[00:04:30]  You go out and you buy it.  It makes perfect sense.  It does.  It really does.  And with the stock splitting again.  Yeah.  What an amazing thing that is.  Well, get in on Microsoft before the split again, you know?  Yeah.  Start buying it now, I guess, if you have the money.  Yeah.  Well, I picked up, you know, a share.  I think I could swing that.  And when it splits?  Hey, I'll have two.  All right.  We're just getting warmed up here.  Later this hour, when you hear Hush by Deep Purple, be the 10th caller. 
[00:05:00]  1027 WNAW, The Rock of New York.  Two for Tuesday.  Dave Matthews Band, Satellite and Stay.  Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds playing February 2nd at the Beacon Theater.  Sold out.  Wow, that would be a cool show to check out.  I just read it on our backboard there, Ant, with all the concerts.  Yeah.  All right.  So, Pete Anthony.  Hey.  How are you?  Good.  Wasn't it kind of strange to see the sun today?  Yeah.  I woke up in a good mood, though. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  You see the sun, you're like, oh, okay.  This is what life's all about.  Man, we've been in a depressing movie the past couple of weeks.  You mean like Brubaker?  It's like coming out of the joint.  Remember Brubaker?  Solitary confinement.  Yeah.  The guys were in there for years.  Yeah.  And Robert Redford.  Throw him in the hole.  Yeah.  Not only brought him outside to see the sun for the first time in years, but gave him sunglasses.  Yeah.  Kind of like how I felt today.  Walking out of the house.  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  I love the slow clap build thing in movies.  Someone gives a speech and everyone's quiet and then one guy will click, click, click.  Yes.  It's been used so many times.  So, you almost killed Yoshi today on the way in.  That dopey ass.  I mean, that would have been funny.  Could you imagine a picture of me in the paper because I hit a pork guy riding his bike down the street? 
[00:06:30]  That would have been really funny.  First of all, they all ride their bikes like maniacs.  But this guy, I mean, we're going down 57th.  And you got two lanes on each side of the road.  I'm in the right lane.  There's a truck double parked in the right lane.  Ooh, go figure.  You never see that.  So, I go to make the move to the left lane.  As I'm making the move to the left lane, the Yoshi, he passes me on the right and then zips around the truck that stopped in the right lane and cuts right in front of my truck. 
[00:07:00]  You missed him by inches.  I got the big bumper guard thing on there.  It wouldn't have made that big a mess.  But I'm going to have to scrape low main off my hood.  You almost hit me.  You drive like a manery rack.  Didn't even face this guy.  No, he's probably been hit 20 times.  How many times do you think these messengers get hit on the streets of New York? 
[00:07:30]  Because some of the moves you see out there are just amazing.  Yeah, I don't know.  I would say they would have to get hit a lot.  Probably not serious because I don't think it's a lot of high speed stuff.  But I could see them riding right into the side of cars.  I bet they hit more cars than cars hit them.  Tell you that.  And they're protected by the big chain and the big lock that they've got wrapped around their bodies.  Very heavy.  I have a battleship chain around my seat. 
[00:08:00]  Well, they're good looking bikes though, aren't they?  Yeah.  With the big racks duct taped on.  I don't know what they're protecting with those huge chains and locks because the bikes look like crap.  Oh, come on.  Walking down the sidewalk, you see that thing not chained up?  It's mine.  I'm taking that baby, riding that home.  Yes, all right.  That's an attractive bike.  Hey, you want to do Brady Bunch trivia today?  Brady Bunch trivia?  Yeah.  Yesterday we did Godfather trivia.  It was very successful.  We're qualifying people for this Super Bowl party this weekend. 
[00:08:30]  Last time you did Brady Bunch trivia, you did quite well, Anthony.  Well, yes, that is my forte.  Yeah, sure.  We'll do that in the 4 o'clock hour.  All right.  Also, it is Tuesday.  You do know what that means.  Matter of fact, Rick's telling me to go to line 5 here.  Hi, N.E.W.  What time is it?  It's time for Tuesday night.  Hello!  You are excited.  That's right, baby. 
[00:09:00]  Priceline.com, Anthony.  I love it.  Where's Anthony?  He stepped out.  I'm Bill Shatner, spokesman for Priceline.com.  Fantastic service.  You're not doing an evil Kirk on us once again today, are you?  No, no, no.  This is Captain James D. Kirk of the Enterprise for Priceline.com.  Yes, we're talking about hotel rooms. 
[00:09:30]  Hotel rooms.  Yes, your 20th century still had them.  Now, you can name your own prize for a hotel room with Priceline.  That's right.  It's fantastic.  I never know when to jump in here, because your pauses are really dramatically long.  I don't understand what you mean by pauses.  Well, I'm trying to do the spot with you, but I'm not sure if you're done with your sentence. 
[00:10:00]  I speak as any man speaks.  I see.  I understand what you're talking about with these pauses.  All right, so Priceline.com has this hotel thing happening.  You name your own price for your hotel, and you give them a call.  Priceline.  1-800-Priceline.  Or visit them on the web, www.priceline.com.  You use their service.  They're going to give you a free hotel night.  You can't beat that.  With a Bukalian stick. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, rock.  God, I dig that song.  I forgot about that.  I haven't played this one in a while, huh?  Yeah.  Two for Tuesday with Deep Purple, Perfect Strangers, on the rock of New York, 1027 WNNW.  Another great song off that CD is Knocking at Your Back Door.  Yeah, definitely.  We haven't played that on the radio in a while.  Maybe next time we do a two for from Purple, we could do that, Deep Purple.  Purple goes down as one of my favorite bands.  Without a doubt.  Definitely.  All right.  It's like monster rock. 
[00:11:00]  Monster rock.  Before that, Hush, and that was the song you had to be listening for this hour to qualify  for that chance to have a Super Bowl party with you and I, Anthony.  Yes.  And we're going to bring the 53-inch big screen projection television with two tuner picture  in picture.  That is cool because that means you don't need two VCRs to operate the pit.  Well, a lot of people that got picture in picture for a while, they were like, yeah,  this is great.  They get home, hook up their cable, whatever, and they turn on and then they go picture 
[00:11:30]  in picture.  And it's like, hey, it's a little blue square in my picture.  Yeah.  They don't explain it to you.  You need two VCRs to work that.  Yeah.  You need like your tuner and one other VCR, like one VCR and the TV.  Yeah.  So just some way to get two different signals in.  But this has two tuners.  That's right.  In the TV itself.  That's right.  It's a true picture in picture.  And this hour, Rick, who's the winner?  Shoot Ed Lippert of Matawan, New Jersey.  Shoot Ed?  Shoot Ed.  Is it the Shoot Ed from the summertime?  No.  It's another Shoot Ed. 
[00:12:00]  Really?  Shoot Ed qualified?  Yep.  We have a lot of brand new listeners.  But in the summertime, we were looking for the worst job in the New York area.  Who had the worst job?  And Shoot Ed won one of the categories, right?  Yeah.  He won for like the weirdest job.  He calls up and he goes, hey, I'm Shoot Ed.  And basically, what does he do?  He's on the boardwalk.  He's on the boardwalk and people get to shoot him with a paint gun.  Yeah.  Like you use for survival games. 
[00:12:30]  Right.  So he just sits there and you get to Shoot Ed.  He goes, yeah, you know, I'm Ed from Shoot Ed.  I'm Ed.  Hi, I'm Shoot Ed.  What's your job?  Shoot Ed.  I'm Ed.  I'm Ed.  You shoot me.  You pay like money and shoot me.  I'm Shoot Ed.  He's hysterical.  He's a trip.  And he's famous now because of our show.  And I guess he takes the winner off.  And I think he told us at the time he works at an auto parts store or something like that.  Auto tech.  Auto tech. 
[00:13:00]  And he'll be back on the boardwalk Memorial Day and he'll get a chance to Shoot Ed.  Shoot him.  So there you go.  Our latest qualifier.  Very cool.  In the four o'clock hour, which we're slowly entering here, we're going to do Brady Bunch trivia  for another chance for this 53-inch Sony TV.  Okay?  Right.  Hey, Ed.  We got your buddy Adam Ferrara on the line here.  Adam.  Where is he?  Adam.  Adam Ferrara.  Hey.  Hey, pal.  What are you doing, my brother?  You're on the air, you bastard.  How are you?  Good. 
[00:13:30]  How you been?  I'm good.  Shoot Ed?  The guy's job is a target?  Yeah.  Yeah.  My God.  People shoot him with paintballs.  Me and Adam used to be avid paintball players.  Oh, yeah.  Back in the old days.  We were the Red Devils.  Uh-huh.  We had jackets and everything.  Oh, it was very embarrassing.  How's it going?  It was fun.  We had a lot of fun out there in Coram, Long Island.  There you go.  But I saw my pal Adam Ferrara on TV the other night.  Ah.  Oh, the special?  Yes, the special.  The special.  Yeah.  What's this all about? 
[00:14:00]  Tell the people.  Okay.  You sound like my mother.  You know he was nominated again.  My son, the comedian.  The people should know.  I got nominated for the American Comedy Award.  And you get to vote over the phone.  I did.  You did vote for me?  Yeah.  Adam leaves a message on my machine.  Hey.  It's Adam.  I'm up for the Comedy Award.  You got to vote.  Here's the number.  It's like, I already voted. 
[00:14:30]  I saw the number.  I saw my pal.  What do you think?  I'm not going to lean over and dial a phone?  I was there when you were at Eastside Comedy Club telling bad Gilligan's Island jokes.  I'm going to be there to call and cast my vote for Adam Ferrara.  Oh, God.  Of course.  You want to hear the funny?  Listen to this.  My mother's message.  I taped this.  Listen to this message she leaves on my machine.  Oh, all right.  That's what she thinks.  But she's not into programming.  So, I hope you called Joe Cabana.  Because we got to win. 
[00:15:00]  All right?  And also, I hope Rory's calling.  I mean, if they're on the net, they should, you know, cast their vote.  So, give me a call tonight.  I'm on pins and needles and I have diarrhea.  Bye.  Hey, there's Mom.  How funny is that?  That's funny.  She's like your trainer.  Oh, the front of the message got cut off.  It was like, I know you're calling your friend, Anthony.  I'm just going to remind you.  Because I made a list of people to call and I feel like I can cross the door. 
[00:15:30]  How is he doing?  Did he cut his hair?  Anyway.  Your mom is treating this like you were outselling magazines door to door.  All right.  We got the Johnson family off the list.  They bought Popular Science.  Buy his chocolate so he can go on the class trip.  Because I did for their children.  Now, they're going to do for mine.  I'm flying her out for the ceremony.  I flew her out last year when I got nominated.  Yeah.  And, like, all the celebrities are there and my parents are looking around. 
[00:16:00]  My mother's elbow and my father are like, Joe, sit up straight.  Travolta's looking.  Excuse me.  I don't want to slouch in front of Barbarino.  Hey, who's...  Now, who are you up against?  Who's that big, fat guy?  Pinnett.  Yeah.  John Pinnett.  Oh, so my mother watches the special.  Look, I saw the special.  First of all, the big guy, not healthy.  He's probably not going to make it to the ceremony.  He's going to die any minute. 
[00:16:30]  Doesn't anyone tell him he's that big?  I mean, another fat comic talking about how he eats a lot.  Yeah.  Oh, and he's weird looking.  Yeah, Schimmel.  Yeah, I voted for Schimmel.  Thanks, though.  He did not.  He's a lioness.  All right.  Come on.  Not only didn't I vote for Schimmel, we're never having him in the studio again.  No, he just isn't funny.  He came in and he was such a drag.  He made us all depressed.  Really?  Like, yeah.  You know what it is with you frigging comedians? 
[00:17:00]  Because they come in and do...  Come on, Marconi.  They come in to do radio, and they don't know how to do radio.  Like, they get up on stage making people laugh, hudler, hudler, hudler.  Right.  They come in, and they're sitting at a microphone, and they don't do anything.  Right.  Like, Adam Ferrara, we have you in here.  What are you doing?  You're in on our prank phone calls.  Yes.  You're hashing stuff.  You're talking about things that you talk about in your act.  You're talking about real life stuff.  Mm-hmm.  These guys come in here.  They might as well be librarians. 
[00:17:30]  What?  For God's sake, talk, Schimmel.  Adam, the Carol Miller call is still one of the hottest bits we've ever done here.  Oh, I like the Brady Bunch thing we did the last time.  Yeah.  We just replayed that the other day.  You did?  How funny was that?  Oh, it was so good to hear the second time around.  People love it.  Well, it's funny because we did it, you know, if you remember, we did it twice.  We did it, the heterosexual Brady Bunch.  And then we were corrected by a listener that he was gay.  And then the listener pointed us to the pages of Blue Boy.  Yeah.  Basically, the bit goes, in case people are tuning in for the first time, Anthony is convinced 
[00:18:00]  that Mike Brady used to, you know, just hang out under the stairs at the Brady household.  He designed the house, and he designed the stairs without backs on them, and a cleverly  little camouflaged garden underneath the stairs for anyone to hide under to look up the stairs.  And where was his study?  His study was, yeah, right at the bottom of the stairs.  Right before it was Greg's room.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  When he was telling his parents by their first name, Carol, Mike.  Mike, Carol.  Why don't you jog up the stairs?  so i'm watching tv and i see adam on there and uh now there's a number to dial to vote for adam

[00:32:30]  police it's opie and anthony and no one could confirm that the hometown of the brady bunch was verona  no it wasn't not one person out there can confirm that it was verona a lot of people are saying westdale  i slipped and said riverdale but all was but but so now we don't know what to do you know what  you're still there you're still there yes no one could confirm that it was verona it's not verona not 
[00:33:00]  one person and we have thousands and thousands of listeners a bunch of people getting on websites and  no one could find that it was verona i'm telling you i'm gonna if it's ever on again i'm gonna make a  copy of it and i'll mail it to you but you don't even know what episode that was even mentioned in  probably the romeo and juliet episode where verona is the town your caller claiming to be a winner says  she watched pretty bunch after school every day on channel five couldn't have channel 11 had 
[00:33:30]  syndication rights from paramount i couldn't tell the difference ah see you probably couldn't tell the  difference then when they were saying verona we're kind of ticked off at you you screwed up  our whole damn game yeah that's a first for tuesday huh i'm glad it's two for tuesday gave you a lot of  time oh yeah it did but now we're in a quandary i think we have to start over yeah we're going to  start over but uh rick's going to get info from you because to tell you the truth if we could uh  prove that it is rona before friday we'll put you in the drawing for the the party at your house

[00:40:00]  and yeah technique 53 it's amazing she just keeps coming up with them when i thought of this book i  thought you know there's no way i'm going to come up with 52 or you know i was going to do 101 more right  wow but i couldn't that was impossible so i would have had to repeat myself yeah yeah do you know  what i mean so i said okay forget the 101 you know i did a whole series on that now i'm going to 52.  you try all these out uh first i'm very proud of this one because i did every single one of them 
[00:40:30]  wow all right and then you know that's why i look so good i guess so my head's been hanging banging on  the headboard 52. who's the lucky guy it's the same eight and a half years  eight and a half years are you guys just like pounding every night no not really yeah you know  um i'm saying i'm thinking to be really honest yeah um well he's the one that really invented the 
[00:41:00]  book for me oh really he's the one that kind of came up with the idea i went through kind of a real  long story make it make make a long story short i was like it was like six weeks we hadn't had sex  i was going through a really no sex which is really bad for a sex author yeah i guess so you really  feel like a hypocrite you know everybody they call a dry spell yeah it's like mark mcguire not  hitting a home run you know oh it was you were in a hump slump is what they call it  all right see i'm coming here i can't stop it okay so i was definitely a hump slump so the guy's trying 
[00:41:30]  everything to get me you know everything you know and and if anybody knows any of my books  all of the pages in 101 nights of great sex are sealed right they're sealed pages they're sealed  pages and i'd be in the kitchen and he'd be going come on i got a surprise for you and i'm not  budging i'm bored so you're the one that wasn't into it for the six weeks i was in this hump 
[00:42:00]  slump slump right and so all of a sudden i kid you not this is what the guy does he comes to my desk and  i was busy i was working on a project and was dragging me down and he puts a blue balloon on  my desk and says see this blue balloon i'm going yeah so it's a blue balloon he goes that blue balloon  if you meet me in the bed on saturday night that's going to make you levitate off the bed and not only  that that blue balloon is going to keep you excited for three days after i boink you get out of here and 
[00:42:30]  i'm like and i'm like no boy man i'm like oh yeah yeah you know but here's what happened you're  banging david copperfield and then it'll burst and doves will fly out of your ass  the invitation asks her to bring one blue balloon into the bedroom and that's supposed to be great  well it's going to keep her excited for three days after you have sex three days i swear 
[00:43:00]  it's impossible yes no it works you'll see even if you hand over your credit cards you can't keep  her excited for three days three days all right let's go to the phones and see if someone could  figure out what the blue balloon trick is all about here hello hi any w how you doing hi what's your  name god hey todd how are you i'm doing great all right doesn't have anything to do with the g-spot  now what how are you going to do how are you going to do work the g-spot and the blue balloon at the 
[00:43:30]  same time a lot pressure point i mean i was thinking if you were well the position i was  thinking of yeah would put pressure on the g-spot and because i can't think of what else you can do  because you can't use it for anything else because it can break or it's the only thing i could think of  would be pressure uh-huh okay so how is that going to keep her excited for three days  well the excitement would be that uh the fact that she she knows how to use a blue balloon without  her face you're really struggling yeah i think we're gonna have to move on man good try though 
[00:44:00]  really good try hi any w the blue balloon trick hello hi all right you got an answer for us yeah i think  you brought the blue balloon and you slowly let the air out onto her uh private part on her what  private part oh oh so you blow it up and then you slowly you blow it up and you slowly let the air out 
[00:44:30]  you know the only way to slowly let air out of a balloon though i think it would ruin the mood sounding like  that feels good doesn't it honey  you know i think i would ruin the mood well laura is he closer no cigar for you sir 
[00:45:00]  but that was a good try to keep her excited for three days with a blue balloon with a blue balloon  all right now i gotta tell you i'll give your audience a hint okay all right why did i see  remember my recipe something plus something equals great sex yes something plus something equals great  sex oh are we supposed to remember this is this a pop quiz i didn't study now that could be a next 
[00:45:30]  question is it wait a minute something i got an idea okay what what what blow up the balloon pretty  good you know put her right above her pusky on her stomach and then bouncer while you're getting  it from behind and do what bouncer on a balloon you know like a little kid riding on the balloon  bouncer on the balloon it's not a hoppity hop  that's interesting we love our audience come on you know it's creative see that's the yeah this is 
[00:46:00]  what turns women on the whole creative element here all right all right so no give us a a a a  go with a hint okay i i sealed the pages in all my books 101 nights of great sex 101 nights of  great romance 101 great cookies and now 52. why did i seal the envelopes that's your hint  oh baby oh baby um now you're getting more i hope this has nothing to do with such a tease 
[00:46:30]  just teases us hi any w hi this is greg hey greg uh i think i might have the answer for the for  the blue blue all right let her rip uh you get some static electricity going and you use it on her uh  body hair oh the whole hover uh technique i guess it might be what is the hover technique 
[00:47:00]  oh you don't know the hover technique that's when you're banging in a helicopter i've heard of the  poover technique that's not the hover technique oh you don't know about hovering no oh this is  really cool check it out guys this is really cool all right you know that that skin makes up almost all  of sex right and most women have very fine hair on their arms and legs exactly so you take except for  opie's first uh shut up girl who by the way had like hair all down her back like a wookie  opie lost his virginity to chewbacca from star wars well she was hot but then i turned over and 
[00:47:30]  she had like a mane that is wow you didn't need it to raise any hair with static electricity you didn't  need that big big re-max hot air balloon rub on her back like the the hindenburg couldn't raise  a hair on this smooth anyway okay okay okay so the hover technique is you take your fingertips yeah 
[00:48:00]  and you instead of massaging a woman with your fingertips you lightly touch her hair and you just  go up and down her body with your fingertips and you hover over her skin so what's that doing for me  huh can i tell you something why do so many women fake orgasms i don't know why because so many  men fake foreplay all right okay so what is this hover technique supposed to do well it excites the 
[00:48:30]  lady more it's the touch and it gives her a little goosebumps all right so this guy very sexy so this  guy thinks the blue technique is no it has nothing to do with electricity or hovering all right all right  thank you all right have a good one bye now wait what kind of balloon was it was is it like a round  one or one of those that you blow up and it goes like a big sausage oh i like that one yeah i bet you  do i think it definitely has to be a sausage all right hi any w hi am i on yes okay hey a girl all right  that's just the anticipation you love it don't you if you have um it in the room and you have like great 
[00:49:00]  sex and then you say like well you know for three days just look at this balloon you're really close  oh it's like a woman to get close now now there are a lot of guys listening to this program what's  your name jennifer jennifer are you married yes i am okay if you got an invitation from your husband and  his name is evan evan and he and he asked you to meet him in the bedroom you know he filled out the  invitation he mailed it to you right you open it up and it's very sexy and asked you to bring one blue 
[00:49:30]  balloon i mean that alone you're going to have an orgasm like reading it aren't you am i right  you just don't know what to expect especially when you're married but isn't that exciting it is very  it is telling you guys it works some guys so you get all worked up and it has nothing to do  oh no she's close she didn't get it but you know what i'm going to send you a copy of the book because  i like the way you think oh thank you are you with your husband right now i wish i was i heard the 
[00:50:00]  contest and i would definitely he would definitely love to do it i'm telling you it'll make him bigger  and make him explode i'm telling you it's the dice man i think i got the blue balloon i know okay  because i understand what this girl is saying see she she equates the balloon to having this great sex  and she just got to look at it but there's something missing right i know it's missing  you fill the balloon with the vital fluid and it's almost like takeout all week 
[00:50:30]  huh did i hit the nail on the head  you know it's like astronaut food for the rest of the week  right i think i got that one right huh  get him out of here that's not right dice  what's wrong with him oh you're so funny so are you going to give us the rest of the answer  the balloon i think if i give it away it's not a technique it's something that you do i'm  listening to you oh my god you gotta give us something i'm gonna give you a bunch of stuff

[00:52:00]  tuesday night there are couples out there joining our club and they're doing the hummer on the the guy  guy yeah yeah and then the guy uh you know he should reciprocate we understand that but a good  icebreaker because after years of marriage or relationship it's so hard for a guy to ask for  that and the girl doesn't usually volunteer the services so it just kind of goes to the wayside  yeah but now it gives an opportunity for a guy to go hey listen to opi and anthony and then he goes 
[00:52:30]  home and he goes hey how about those wacky guys you hear them there hummer club boy that's silly huh  as the zipper's going down you know i like it we're opening the lines of communication with  the couple i think and you know what i'm a big person when it comes to oral i mean i am i am  i mean i've got like 12 15 hummer pages in this book really into that all right and both people  become members of the club as well so they don't feel like they're left out and then it's a cool  little conversation piece on the weekends uh when you're at a party or something uh-huh you're like 
[00:53:00]  hey man are you a part of the tuesday night hummer club and it's cool uh-huh i think that's a great  club and the guys in general love it i mean right now as we speak someone is joining the club on a  highway somewhere awesome do they get any prizes when they call in and if they're actually doing  the hummer oh just the satisfaction of getting the hummer and becoming a member of the club is  and you know i've made the last two years of my life uh uh my goal to create different kinds of  hummers because the whole thing is you know the same old hum is kind of boring after a while too 
[00:53:30]  i don't know even a bad one's a good one i know that is true but but if you're gonna hum on her  guys there's are there's so many different things you can do with your tongue all right you want to  find that couple i do now what is the deal if we do this couple go ahead you'll win um it's laura  corn challenge the uh my new book 52 invitations to great sex 101 nights of great sex 101 nights of  great romance and 101 great quickies yeah and i'll even throw my g-spot video in you want a couple

[01:22:30]  fine toe cleavage obviously not foot fetish guys no when i'm walking down the street i'm not looking  at cleavage going look at her toes open look at the set of toes on her wow look at that you think  they're real or fake i think she's had big toe implants come on i don't know look she's wearing 
[01:23:00]  that sheer sock i think i see nails laura i'm not buying it i'm not buying it i think that's a woman's  idea of what the man's fetish is that i could buy but it's not the actual men's fetish well wait  wait a minute rick she got herself all worked up her headphones are twirled around her seat  oh look she's okay i think she's trying out a new technique it's called wrap the wire around your 
[01:23:30]  seat now laura i can't accept that i can't even as the fetish okay now i'm i'm number one fetish for  guys okay well that's what it is it's a foot fetish we're not talking fantasy we're talking fetish and  that's i guess where the definition is and it comes from a book called sexy origins and this is  where people get i mean it's origins from sexual and that shoe is the type of shoe no no no no it's  the open toe shoe the true foot fetish guy wants to see the toes and they surmise it's because of the 
[01:24:00]  cleavage because of the sluts he's a toe man i'm a heel man myself yeah well i mean it's high heels  i like the arch all right so we got the answer to that let's put her on hold oh god you want a  coffee all right she's on hold line two oh i'm not buying that line two rick she's she gets a book  a woman that's a woman i think that's a woman's version of a man's fetish because that's as  acceptable okay what do you think is the fetish then if you don't think it's toes guys opie and
