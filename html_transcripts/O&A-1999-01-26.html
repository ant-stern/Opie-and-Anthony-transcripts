<pre> 1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, 2 for Tuesday, David Bowie from Ziggy Stardust, Moonage,  Daydream and the Gene Genie.  A couple from Rush to get the show going today, it's Opie and Anthony.  Good afternoon.  How are you buddy?  Oh, very good.  How are you?  Uh, I see something going on with the opes.  I don't know.  All right, wait, close your mouth.  Yeah.  Put your face near the mic.  Inhale through your nose.  Yeah, welcome to the wonderful world of influenza. 
[00:30]
 Come on.  This is bizarre.  When you picked me up today, I was fine.  Yeah, that's how it happens.  By the time we got into any W I'm like this.  I got sick on the way in.  It happens that fast.  The bug hit me in between my driveway and the any W parking lot.  Did you think it wasn't going to happen?  I was ready to spray the Lysol.  You can spray it.  There you go.  Just don't get in my coffee. 
[01:00]
 Everyone around here had the flu, right?  Yeah.  Uh, you didn't.  You're in here every day.  It was bound to happen.  It's like you, you go into the, the old bath houses in New York in the seventies and not  expecting to get boinked.  I was convinced it was going to pass me by, but no, no, no, I guess not.  Yeah.  You're a little sniffly there.  I feel all right.  I'm just getting really stuffed up.  I just hope I don't get the throat thing.  That's how it happens.  You know what happens when you started with the nose and then went to the throat? 
[01:30]
 Yeah.  I had, remember I had the cold for a while and I'm sneezing like crazy.  Yeah.  And then it turns into this, uh, this nasal drip thing that goes into your throat and  that's where your throat starts hurting.  And then out of nowhere, fever in your eyes feel like they're going to, well, I got that  already out of your head.  I got the burning eyes again.  I had that last week though, too.  And then when Lisa comes in to give you a back rub, all of a sudden she goes, Oh my  God, your heart. 
[02:00]
 And then you go home and I do the show and I call you from your room.  Yeah.  I don't think you're going to make the, I think I'm, I'm out one day this week.  You think?  Yeah.  It's only Tuesday.  I'm starting to feel it.  We'll see.  We'll see how it works.  Hopefully not.  Well, of course, because this is my life.  This is my life right here.  I don't want to stay home.  All right.  We're ready to rock.  Yeah.  I'm, uh, the process of upgrading right now to windows 98 on the laptop. 
[02:30]
 So Opie will be, uh, looking at all the instant feedback.  Yes.  I figured I had to give Bill Gates just a couple of more bucks.  Now why are you always looking a little down, uh, down the dump?  You were very happy with your windows 95.  What is the problem?  Well, Opie, if I may, can I just maybe, uh, you need a little forum, Anthony?  I'm going to give a little conspiracy theory out here.  I might sound a little crazy, but with the internet, you never know.  Okay.  I had windows 95, uh, since it came out, very happy with it.  Good operating system for me.  It's working well. 
[03:00]
 Not many bugs.  Occasionally something happens.  That's fine.  You deal with it.  Windows 98 comes out.  I'm thinking, why do I have to upgrade to windows 98 windows 95 treating me fine?  Why screw with something that's working?  I'm still on the net.  I'm cruising the web, blah, blah, blah.  All of a sudden things start going wrong.  What do you mean going wrong?  Programs get buggy.  Screen freezes, screen freeze, crashes.  And, and I'm hearing windows 98.  Oh, diagnostics takes care of problems that you have. 
[03:30]
 It just works better than 95.  I start thinking, boy, this Bill Gates and Microsoft, you're cruising the web.  Who's to say they're not popping some kind of bugs in on your windows 95 while you're  online to make it screw up?  So you start going must buy windows 98.  And you know something? 
[04:00]
 It worked.  Yeah.  Because I'm booting up the 98 right now.  You ran out and you got the 98.  So that's my little conspiracy theory.  I think they're bugging 95 to force you to buy 98.  And just slowly but surely.  Yeah, just a little.  You don't really notice it at first and just.  No, no.  It doesn't degrade your confidence in windows.  See, they can't totally screw it up on you because then you go, oh, this window is my  God.  Just enough that you go, boy, I bet 98 will fix that. 
[04:30]
 You go out and you buy it.  It makes perfect sense.  It does.  It really does.  And with the stock splitting again.  Yeah.  What an amazing thing that is.  Well, get in on Microsoft before the split again, you know?  Yeah.  Start buying it now, I guess.  You have the money.  Yeah.  Well, I picked up, you know, a share.  I think I could swing that and when it splits.  Hey, I love to.  We're just getting warmed up here later this hour when you hear Hush by Deep Purple be 
[05:00]
 the 10th caller one to seven W.N.A.W.  The Rock of New York, two for Tuesday.  Dave Matthews Band satellite and stay Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds playing February  2nd at the Beacon Theatre sold out.  Wow.  That would be a cool show to check out.  I just read on our backboard there at one of the concerts.  Yeah.  All right.  So, Pete, Anthony, how are you?  Good.  Was it kind of strange to see the sun today?  Yeah, I woke up in a good mood, though. 
[05:30]
 Yeah.  You see the sun.  I know.  OK, this is what life's all about.  Man, we've been in a depressing movie the past couple of weeks.  You mean like Brew Baker?  It's like coming out of the joint.  We're Brew Baker, Solitary Confinement.  The guys were in there for years.  Yeah.  And Robbie Redford.  Throw him in the hole.  Yeah.  Not only brought him outside to see the sun for the first time in years, but gave him  sunglasses.  Yeah.  Kind of like how I felt today.  Walking out of the house.  Yeah. 
[06:00]
 I love the slow clap build thing in movies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[06:30]
 Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was the 50th, 57th, and you got two lanes on each side of the road.  Mm-hm.  I'm in the right lane.  There's a truck double parked in the right lane.  Go figure you never see that.  So, I go to make the move to left lane.  As I'm making the move to left lane, the Yoshi, he passes me on the right and then zips around 
[07:00]
 the truck that stopped in the right lane and cuts right in front of my truck.  You missed them by inches.  I got the big bumper guard thing on there.  It wouldn't have made that big a mess.  They went out to scrape low main off my hood.  You almost hit me!  You drive like a main rear rack!  I didn't even face this guy.  No, he's probably been hit twenty times.  How many times do you think these messengers get hit on the streets of New York? 
[07:30]
 Because some of the moves you see out there are just amazing.  Yeah, I don't know.  I would say they would have to get hit a lot.  Probably not serious because I don't think it's a lot of high speed stuff.  But I can see them riding right into the side of cars.  I bet they hit more cars than cars hit them.  I'll tell you that.  They're protected by the big chain and the big lock that got wrapped around their bodies.  Very heavy!  I have a battleship chain around my seat! 
[08:00]
 They're good looking bikes though, aren't they?  With the big racks duct taped on.  I don't know what they're protecting with those huge chains and locks because the bikes look like crap.  Come on, walking down the sidewalk you see that thing not chained up?  It's mine!  I'm taking that baby riding that home!  Yes, alright.  That's an attractive bike.  Hey, you want to do Brady Bunch Trivia today?  Brady Bunch Trivia?  Yesterday we did Godfather Trivia.  It was very successful.  We're qualifying people for this Super Bowl party this weekend. 
[08:30]
 Last time you did Brady Bunch Trivia you did quite well, Anthony.  Well, yes, that is my forte.  Yeah, sure.  We'll do that in the four o'clock hour.  Alright.  Also, it is Tuesday.  You do know what that means.  As a matter of fact, Rick's telling me to go to line five here.  Hi, NW!  What time is it?  It's time for Tuesday Night, Henny!  You are excited!  That's right, baby! 
[09:00]
 Friesline.com, Anthony.  I love it.  Where's Anthony?  He stepped out.  I'm Bill Shatner, spokesman for Friesline.com.  Fantastic service.  You're not doing an evil Kirk on us once again today, are you?  No, no, no.  This is Captain James D. Kirk of the Enterprise for Friesline.com.  We're talking about hotel rooms. 
[09:30]
 Hotel rooms.  Yes, your 20th century still had them.  Now, you can name your own prize for a hotel room with Friesline.  That's right.  It's fantastic.  I never know when to jump in here because your pauses are really dramatically long.  I don't understand what you mean by pauses.  Well, I'm trying to do the spot with you, but I'm not sure if you're done with your 
[10:00]
 sentence.  I speak as any man thinks.  I see.  I understand what you're talking about with these pauses.  All right, so Friesline.com has this hotel thing happening.  You name your own price for your hotel and you give them a call.  Friesline, 1-800-Friesline or visit them on the web, www.Friesline.com.  You use their service, they're going to give you a free hotel night.  Look at pizza with a buccalian steak.  Yeah, rock. 
[10:30]
 I dig that song.  I forgot about that.  I haven't played this one in a while.  Two for Tuesday with Deep Purple, Perfect Strangers on the Rock of New York, 1027W on  EW.  Another great song off that CD is Knockin' at Your Back Door.  We haven't played that on the radio in a while.  Maybe next time we do a two for From Purple we could do that.  Deep Purple.  Purple Goes Down is one of my favorite bands.  Without a doubt.  Definitely.  All right, it's like Monster Rock. 
[11:00]
 Monster Rock!  Before that hush, that was the song you had to be listening for this hour to qualify for  that chance to have a Super Bowl party with you and I, Anthony.  Yes.  And we're going to bring the 53-inch big screen projection television with two tuner,  picture in picture.  That is cool because that means you don't need two VCRs to operate the pip.  Well, a lot of people that got picture in picture for a while, they were like, yeah,  this is great.  They get home, hook up their cable, whatever, and they turn on it and they go picture in  picture. 
[11:30]
 It's like, hey, it's a little blue square in my picture.  Yeah, they don't explain to you.  You need two VCRs to work that.  Yeah, you need like your tuner and one other VCR, like one VCR and the TV.  Yeah.  There's some way to get two different signals in.  But this has two tuners in the TV itself.  That's right.  It's a true picture in picture.  And this hour, Rick, who's the winner?  Shoot Ed Lippard of Model One New Jersey.  Shoot Ed?  Shoot Ed.  Is it the Shoot Ed from the summertime?  No.  It's another Shoot Ed. 
[12:00]
 Really?  Shoot Ed qualified?  Yep.  Now, we have a lot of brand new listeners, but in the summertime we were looking for  the worst job in the New York area who had the worst job.  And Shoot Ed won one of the categories, right?  Yeah, he won for like the weirdest job.  He calls up and he goes, hey, I'm Shoot Ed.  And basically what does he do?  He's on the boardwalk and people get to shoot him with a paint gun like he used for survival 
[12:30]
 games.  Right.  So he just sits there and you get to shoot Ed.  He goes, yeah, I'm Ed from Shoot Ed.  I'm Ed.  Hi, I'm Shoot Ed.  What's your job?  Shoot Ed.  I'm Ed.  You shoot me.  You pay like money and shoot me.  I'm Shoot Ed.  He's hysterical.  He's a trip and he's famous now because of our show.  And I guess he takes the winner off and I think he told us at the time he works at an  auto parts store or something like that.  Auto tech.  Auto tech. 
[13:00]
 And he'll be back on the boardwalk Memorial Day and he'll get a chance to shoot Ed.  Shoot him.  So there you go.  Our latest qualifier.  Very cool.  In the four o'clock hour, which we're slowly entering here, we're going to do Brady Bunch  trivia for another chance for this 53 inch Sony TV.  Right.  Hey, Ed, we got your buddy Adam Ferraro on the line here.  Adam, where is he?  Adam.  Adam Ferraro.  Hey.  Hey, pal.  What are you doing, my brother?  You're on the air, you bastard.  How are you?  Good. 
[13:30]
 How you been?  I'm good.  Shoot Ed?  Yeah.  Yeah.  My God.  People shoot him with paintballs.  Me and Adam used to be avid paintball players.  Oh, yeah.  Back in the old days, we were the Red Devils.  We had jackets and everything.  Oh, it was very embarrassing.  It was fun.  We had a lot of fun out there in Coram, Long Island.  There you go.  I saw my pal Adam Ferraro on TV the other night.  Oh, the special.  Yes, the special.  The special.  Yeah. 
[14:00]
 What's this all about?  Tell the people.  You sound like my mother.  You know, he was nominated again.  My son, the comedian.  People should know.  I got nominated for the American Comedy Awards.  And you get to vote over the phone.  I did.  You did vote for me?  Yeah.  Adam leaves a message on my machine.  Adam, I'm up for the Comedy Award.  You got to vote.  Here's the number.  It's like, I already voted. 
[14:30]
 I saw the number.  I saw my pal.  What do you think?  I'm not going to lean over and dial a phone?  I was there when you were at Eastside Comedy Club telling bad Gilligan's Island jokes.  I'm going to be there to call and cast my vote for Adam Ferraro.  Oh, God.  Of course.  You want to hear the funny?  Listen to this.  My mother's message.  I hate this.  Listen to this message she leaves on my machine.  That's what she thinks.  But she's not into programming.  So I hope you call joke Adam because we've got to win.  All right?  Also, I hope Rory's calling. 
[15:00]
 If they're on the net, they should cast their votes.  Give me a call tonight.  I'm on Pains and Needles and I have diarrhea.  Bye.  Hey, there's Mom.  How funny is that?  She's like your trainer.  The front of the message got cut off.  It was like, I know you're calling your friend Anthony.  I'm just going to remind you because I made a list of people to call and I feel like I 
[15:30]
 can cross the door.  How is he doing?  Did he cut his hair?  Anyway.  Your mom is treating this like you were out selling magazines door to door.  All right, we got the Johnson family off the list.  They bought Popular Science.  Buy us chocolate so we can go on the class trip.  Because I did for their children.  Now they're going to do for mine.  I'm flying her out for the ceremony.  I flew her out last year when I got nominated.  All the celebrities are there. 
[16:00]
 My parents are looking around.  My mother's elbow in my father's like, Joe, sit up straight.  Travolta's looking.  Excuse me, I don't want to slouch in front of Barbarino.  Now who are you up against?  Who's that big fat guy?  Panet.  Oh, so my mother watches the special?  I saw the special.  First of all, the big guy, not healthy.  He's probably not going to make it to the ceremony.  He's going to die any minute. 
[16:30]
 Doesn't anyone tell him he's that big?  I mean, another fat comic talking about how he eats a lot.  And he's weird.  Schimmel.  Yeah, Schimmel.  Yeah, I voted for Schimmel.  Thanks, Joe.  He did not.  He's a lying ass.  All right.  Come on.  Not only did I vote for Schimmel, we're never having him in the studio again.  No, he's just isn't funny.  He came in and he was such a drag.  He made us all depressed.  Really?  Yeah, you know what it is with you frigging comedians? 
[17:00]
 They come in and do radio and they don't know how to do radio.  They get up on stage making people laugh, huddle, huddle, huddle.  Right.  They come in and they're sitting at a microphone and they don't do anything.  Like Adam Ferrara, we have you in here.  What are you doing?  You're in on our prank phone calls.  Yes.  You're hashing stuff.  You're talking about things that you talk about in your act.  You're talking about real life stuff.  These guys come in here, they might as well be librarians. 
[17:30]
 Right.  For God's sake, talk Schimmel.  Adam, the Carole Miller call is still one of the hottest bits we've ever done here.  I like the Brady Bunch thing we did the last time.  Yeah, we just replayed that the other day.  You did?  How funny is that?  Oh, it was so good to hear the second time around.  A beloved.  It's funny because we did it, remember we did it twice.  We did it the heterosexual Brady Bunch.  And then we were corrected by a listener that he was gay.  And then the listener pointed us to the pages of Blue Boy.  Basically the bit goes in case people are tuning in for the first time, 
[18:00]
 Anthony is convinced that Mike Brady used to just hang out under the stairs at the Brady household.  He designed the house and he designed the stairs without backs on them  and a cleverly little camouflage garden underneath the stairs  for anyone to hide under to look up the skits.  And where was his study?  His study was right at the bottom of the stairs.  Right before it was Greg's room.  But he was called by their first name, Carol, Mike.  Why don't you jog up the stairs? 
[18:30]
 So I'm watching TV and I see Adam on there.  And now there's a number to dial to vote for Adam Ferrara.  Yeah, the number is 1-900-370-5020.  And you can vote on the net also at ComedyCentral.com.  Now I'm noticing it's a 900 number.  This might alarm people as to thinking that they're going to get billed 25 bucks off of  Sally the Suck Slut's phone thing, you know?  But this is not true. 
[19:00]
 This is, what is it, 50 cents a call?  Does it go to a good cause? That's what I saw.  It does. It goes to the Support Adam's Cranky Parents Fund.  Because it's very nice.  Oh, you mean the ship is finally coming in, De Niro?  I saw on the special, it went to Comic Relief.  Yeah, no, it got to Comic Relief.  Good cause.  It's very cool.  So we encourage our listeners to help out.  Comic Relief, of course, raising money to shut Robin Williams up. 
[19:30]
 One funny guy.  Did you ever notice when you spray Windex on a window and rub it, it comes clean?  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, he's brilliant. He's got stream of consciousness.  He's not saying anything funny.  And I hopped in my car, I stepped on the little skinny pedal, and it went faster.  Well, yeah, it's the gas pedal, Robin.  That's not funny.  That's not funny. 
[20:00]
 People laugh at him because he talks fast, Adam.  But the timing.  It's all in the timing, is that it?  Rickles has great timing, but he's not saying anything.  Now, Anthony, why don't you put a hockey skate on your face and skate?  Thank you, Don.  You know, potatoes is a vegetable, but not from you, you Idaho hockey puck.  Oh, he's killing me.  What does it mean?  I don't know.  Now, Anthony, who's funnier, Robin Williams or Louis Anderson?  Oh, God.  Cause I know you're a big fan of Louis Anderson as well. 
[20:30]
 Was Louis ever nominated for this award?  I don't know.  I did a TV show, but I don't think he was ever...  I saw that, man.  To see my pal having to shake his big, sweaty, fat Vienna sausage fingers.  Vienna sausage?  Did you talk to him?  Yeah, we just talked during a commercial.  How you doing?  Fine.  All right, we're at a commercial.  And then he goes his way, I go mine.  He didn't start bitching about how he was beaten as a child.  That's like all he ever talks about. 
[21:00]
 Oh, Louis, that's so funny.  Yeah, when I was in kindergarten, all the students used to punch me in the face.  Louis, are you tearing me apart with that comedy, Louis?  Yeah, my father was a drunk and he used to lob whiskey bottles at my head.  Stop, I'm cramping up, Louis!  I don't find him funny either, Adam.  You don't find Louis funny?  I have one favorite comedian, and it's Adam Ferrara. 
[21:30]
 Oh, my God, I'm dying here.  I have more to grab my eye.  Even if I didn't know you, you still make me laugh.  Thank you, my brother.  I point at the TV, I go, look at that bastard, I know him.  Look at that funny little bastard.  Yeah!  What else you got going on?  Any TV, any movie deals?  What do you got?  Movie deals coming up.  I actually did an episode of The Love Boat.  No, stop it!  Yes!  Yes!  I love it! 
[22:00]
 Yes!  Oh, I love it!  I was on the set for Bikini Day!  Come on!  No!  Dude, really?  You know how great Bikini Day is?  Okay, this is the set.  It's on a soundstage, right?  Wait, it's not a real boat?  No!  You just killed it for me.  Fred Flintstone doesn't live in bedrock.  So it's on a soundstage and they shoot all this stuff by the pool in one day. 
[22:30]
 So the assistant director goes,  Alright girls, tomorrow's Bikini Day, please wax.  So I show up the next day and there's herds of beautiful women.  Wow!  It's like I heard the angels sing.  I tear in the face of reality and I crawl into babelands.  It's like God's way of saying,  Oh, he has suffered enough.  What was your storyline?  They were gorgeous.  Let me tell you about the girls.  I'll tell you the storyline.  They were gorgeous, right? 
[23:00]
 But then when they opened their mouths,  someone called Bunny played the piano wrong to piss off Yosemite Sam.  Da da da da da da da da da da da da!  Hi, where are you from?  Da da!  So I was noticing, are you mad or anything?  Da da!  They're only supposed to look good, man.  Oh, they're gorgeous.  Also the storyline?  Yeah, I've got to know what your storyline was.  There's a guy coming on a love boat for his bachelor party 
[23:30]
 and before his wife gets into port,  he's going to try and screw around with some of the bikini girls.  Oh, and that's you?  No, I can't have this.  I'm the voice of moral consciousness.  Come on!  In order to keep him from screwing around with his wife,  me and this other guy put his allergy pills in his glass  and we knock them out, but we think we killed them.  You slipped them a Mickey.  So we slip a Mickey and his wife comes on the ship,  so while the other guy is trying to keep her from getting that guy, 
[24:00]
 I'm running around with this weekend at Bernie's guy in a wheelchair.  Oh no.  Yeah, I'm wheeling them all around.  So now is Anson Williams in this?  No, it's Robert Yurik.  Robert Yurik?  Who are the other guest stars?  Chris McNichols?  No, it was me!  Now that I think of it, it was me!  Hey, wait a minute!  I'm the guest star!  You're a pisser, man.  Alright, give us the number one more time.  1900-370-5020. 
[24:30]
 Vote on the net at www.comedycentral.com.  Vote for my pal Adam.  I want to come see you guys when I'm back in town.  Hey, if you win, you've got to fly me to the awards.  Okay.  You got it.  Hi, NW.  You know, Bobby, cheaters never prosper.  And when you cheat, you're only cheating yourself.  So drop those pants and take your punishment like a man.  Dad, why is my voice changing?  Well, Peter, your voice is changing because you're going through puberty 
[25:00]
 and your testicles are dropping.  And speaking about dropping, how about you drop those pants and let  your old dad check them out?  That's pretty damn funny.  Very, very good.  It's 2 for Tuesday.  That was Zeppelin.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I've got to grab something and say something.  What have you got?  I think we could do that next.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Okay.  We're qualifying people to win a Super Bowl party at your house. 
[25:30]
 The deal is me and Ed come by with the Sony 53 inch big screen projection  television and we party with you this Sunday.  And just by qualifying, you'll win a $50 multi-sport passport to Chelsea  Pierce.  And then you'll win a $50 multi-sport passport to Chelsea.  And then you qualify to have the Super Bowl Super Bowl party throw at your  house.  All right.  So this hour we're doing Brady Bunch trivia, just like Godfather trivia  yesterday.  First person to stop Anthony will qualify for the Super Bowl party. 
[26:00]
 Yes.  So if you got a Brady Bunch question, you got to give us a call right now  at 212-757-1027.  And quickly before we move on here, got a great instant feedback from Joe  from Long Beach.  You see this one?  No, I would love to read it, but I just upgraded to Windows 98 and I can't  seem to get on the network.  Yeah.  You just took an hour and a half to upgrade.  Yeah, I've upgraded.  Now it's better than ever.  According to Microsoft.  I now have Windows 98.  I can't get on our network here.  For some reason, it's not letting me on.  Maybe Scott Colombo could help me out. 
[26:30]
 That would be nice.  Yeah.  Well, one of the biggest stories of the day is that guy who got his,  got the hand transplant.  Yeah.  And he's got a little bit of a  prosthesis.  And then they threw a hand on there from a guy that was just brain dead,  just laying in his hospital bed.  Yeah.  They just lopped off this guy's hand and reattached it to the guy's hand.  Yeah.  And then they threw a hand on there from a guy that was just brain dead,  just laying in his hospital bed.  Yeah.  And then they threw a hand on there from a guy that was just brain dead,  just laying in his hospital bed.  Yeah.  And then they threw a hand on there from a guy that was just brain dead,  just laying in his hospital bed.  Yeah.  And then they threw a hand on there from a guy that was just brain dead,  just laying in his hospital bed.  Yeah. 
[27:00]
 And then they threw a hand on there from a guy that was just brain dead,  just laying in his hospital bed.  And then they threw a hand on there from a guy that was just brain dead,  just laying in his hospital bed.  Yeah.  And they just lopped off this guy's hand and reattached it to the guy from Jersey.  Guy's been dreaming about this since he had the accident that someday they'd be able to  transplant the human hand.  And with microsurgery and anti-rejection drugs, they're able to do it.  Yes.  But they say it's still risky.  Well, it's going to take about a year before they even can tell if it's going to be worth  any — 
[27:30]
 Yeah, 50-50 shot.  that it might just dry up and fall off.  Well, this is Joe from Long Beach.  This is how our faithful listeners think and that's why we love you guys.  If that guy who got someone else's hand reattached to his arm masturbates, does that now make  him gay?  Hey, wait, it's some guy with a guy's hand.  Ew!  Oh, think of the poor dead guy. 
[28:00]
 It's like his spirit, you know, it probably goes away.  It's like, what the heck?  At least my parts will go to good use.  My eyes went to that poor girl that went blind from diabetes.  My hand to that pro tennis player that's now a world champion.  Wait, wait, my hand.  My kidneys went to the...  Wait, wait, my hand.  What's he doing with my hand?  Oh my God!  That's sick.  Is that awful?  Funny though, these are the questions people wonder about though.  All right, so we're doing Brady Bunch trivia next to qualify you for that party at your 
[28:30]
 house for the Super Bowl with the 53 inch big screen projection television from Sony.  1027 WNAW, the Rock of New York, Allison Chains from Dirt Down in a Hole and No Excuses from  Jar of Flies, it's Opie and Anthony.  Thank you.  Hanging on 2 for Tuesday.  And on the way we got some police for you.  But right now I think we're heading into Brady Bunch trivia.  Yes, yes we are.  We're trying to qualify another person to have that Super Bowl party thrown at your  house.  Just to qualify you'll win a $50 multi-sport passport to Chelsea Piers and then you'll 
[29:00]
 be in the running to have us come to your house with a 53 inch Sony big screen projection  television.  And we are going to just rock Sunday.  You get to keep that.  Yesterday everyone enjoyed Godfather trivia so we figured we'd go with another one of  Anthony's faves, the Brady Bunch.  So if you've got a question for Anthony, 2127571027, the first person to stump Anthony will qualify 
[29:30]
 for the party, okay?  Alright, let's go to the phones.  Hi, Andy W, who's this?  My name's Rich.  Alright, Rich, you've got a question for Anthony.  Yes, when Greg wanted to become a rock and roll star, what name was given for him?  Oh, that's an easy one.  I even know that one.  Johnny Bravo.  Hey, thanks, bro.  Sorry.  That's okay.  The only reason they picked him, Anthony?  Because he's got a great name.  He fit the suit.  Andy W, who's this?  This is Kim.  Alright, Kim, what's your question?  I wanted to know what Jan's and Ken's boyfriend's name was.  George Glass.  That's right.  Thanks for trying.  Okay, bye.  Hi, Andy W.  Hey, nobody's stumped you yet?  Not yet, let's go.  Okay, alright, there was an episode where Cal Brady and Cindy Brady were both bedridden 
[30:00]
 with something.  What was that?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[30:30]
 I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Riverdale?  Yeah.  No?  What was it?  Verona.  Verona?  Verona?  What?  Yes, they lived in Verona.  I want a ruling.  Go ahead.  I need a ruling on this.  What episode had that?  I'm not sure, but it was definitely Verona. 
[31:00]
 Oh, come on.  I'm serious.  I'm the biggest Brady ones fan.  Verona.  Verona.  Now, how do you even know that?  Because it used to be on Channel 5 every day after school, and I watched it every single  day.  Why did you say it was Verona?  It was definitely Verona.  They said one time Verona.  I'm not sure about this, but you can look it up at any book.  It's Verona.  Oh, no, no, no.  Something's on that.  Now we need a ruling on this.  Go ahead.  I don't think she's right.  All right.  Let's put her on hold here.  I think it's Riverdale.  No, no, no.  Not Riverdale.  No. 
[31:30]
 Look at this.  She threw me for a loop, but I don't think she's right.  Well, what's your name just in case you want?  What's your name?  Lisa DeHope.  All right, Lisa.  Where are you calling from?  Newton, New Jersey.  All right.  We're going to check on this, and you possibly won.  I know I won.  I don't remember Verona whatsoever.  I'm telling you.  All right.  You win the $50 multi-sport passport to Chelsea Piers, and you qualify to have a Super Bowl  party thrown at your house.  Thank you very much.  Hold on the line.  Rick's going to take care of you. 
[32:00]
 Okay.  All right.  I don't think she's right.  A little controversy, Anthony.  No one could prove that the hometown in the Brady Bunch was Verona.  I don't think so.  I think that girl's on crack.  So no one knows the answer to that.  We're trying to find out.  It's Riverdale, dude.  I think it was the name of the high school.  Riverdale, right?  Yeah, I think that's it.  All right.  Stick around.  We might have to continue with Brady Bunch trivia.  The Rock of New York, 1027 W.A.W. 
[32:30]
 Two for Tuesday with the police.  It's Opie and Anthony.  And no one could confirm that the hometown in the Brady Bunch was Verona.  No, it wasn't.  Not one person out there can confirm that it was Verona.  A lot of people are saying Westdale.  I slipped and said Riverdale, but...  The goal was, but...  But...  So now we don't know what to do.  You know what?  You're still there.  You didn't win.  You're still there?  Yes.  No one could confirm that it was Verona. 
[33:00]
 It's not Verona.  Not one person.  And we have thousands and thousands of listeners.  A bunch of people getting on websites and no one could find that it was Verona.  I'm telling you, if it's ever on again, I'm going to make a copy of it and I'll mail it  to you.  But you don't even know what episode that was even mentioned in.  Probably the Romeo and Juliet episode where Verona is the town.  Your caller claiming to be a winner says she watched Brady Bunch after school every day  on Channel 5.  Couldn't have. 
[33:30]
 Channel 11 had syndication rights from Paramore.  Same thing.  I was young.  I couldn't tell the difference.  Ah, see?  You probably couldn't tell the difference then when they were saying Verona.  We kind of ticked off at you.  You screwed up our whole damn game.  Yeah.  That's a first.  I could go ahead and sue for Tuesday.  Huh?  I could go ahead and sue for Tuesday.  Gave you a lot of time.  Ah, yeah, it did.  But now we're in a quandary.  I think we have to start over.  Yeah, we're going to start over.  But Rick's going to get info from you because to tell you the truth, if we could prove that  it is Verona before Friday, we'll put you in the drawing for the party at your house 
[34:00]
 for the Super Bowl.  Okay.  I don't either, but hold on the line, okay?  Okay.  All right, so let's continue with the game.  Yeah.  Simple as this.  You've got to stump Anthony with a Brady Bunch trivia question.  212-757-1027.  If you do so, you'll be in the running for the Super Bowl party at your house.  And we're going to bring the Sony 53-inch big screen projection television.  And we leave it with you.  It's yours after the game.  Yeah.  Okay?  All right.  Let's go back to the phones here.  Hi, Andy W.  Hey, what's up, buddy? 
[34:30]
 I've got a Brady question.  Yeah, what's your question?  What commercial did the Bradys sign up for and what was the product on the show?  Safe.  Laundry detergent.  Damn it.  Thanks for playing.  Thanks.  All right, we're off to a good start.  Hi, Andy W.  Hey.  Hi, what's up?  Here's the question.  Okay.  What town did Carol Brady grow up in as a kid?  What town did she grow up in as a kid?  This was mentioned in an episode.  It was?  Oh, I swear to it.  People in your towns. 
[35:00]
 I got my hand in a stack of Bibles.  Let's see.  Let me think.  There's a reason I know this, but I can't tell you what that is.  That's a tough one.  This guy might get it all.  That's okay.  He might get it.  Now, what's the answer?  Go ahead.  Not even a guess.  No, it's not even ringing a bell.  Wow.  I don't even know where to go for the answer for that.  All right.  It was Swampscott, Massachusetts.  And how do you know that?  Because it's a city.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[35:30]
 I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  The Godfather trivia was so much easier.  Was it?  It really was.  My goodness. 
[36:00]
 All right, hold on the line.  Sure.  We might have to give it to them.  That sounds more logical than the hometown being Verona.  I don't know what that girl was talking about.  All right.  Well, there you go.  We'll clarify that person because we've got to move on with the show.  Yes.  We can't spend the whole day on this.  Ridiculous.  You've got to stick around.  One of our favorite, favorite guests of all time is coming in today, Laura Korn.  She's a sexpert.  Yes.  And a lot of fun.  We're eating and she's just a blast to hang with.  She's very open.  We'll be taking calls. 
[36:30]
 She throws out little tidbits of knowledge about sex.  It's great.  Trust me, you're going to want to stick around, okay?  And we'll do two from the Stone Temple Pilots next.  Stay there.  Stay where?  Here?  Let me do Rick's job for him.  Oh my God.  Uh-oh.  What did he do?  He pulled a commercial.  Are you kidding me?  No.  Don't worry about it.  I'll take care of it.  Rick, you are screwed, man.  Rick, there's no commercials. 
[37:00]
 Laura, look how hot you look.  Wow.  Wow, you look great.  Oh my God.  You look like better than ever.  Oh, look at her.  Wow.  Making money.  Wow, look at you.  I guess.  That's the main thing, what money can do.  Man, do you got new boobs or anything?  No.  Yeah.  New boobs.  Styling, guys.  How you doing?  Wow.  You surprised me at all.  It's about time.  Hi Laura, give me a hug, man.  We're in a cluster F right now, but don't mind us. 
[37:30]
 Yeah, we'll settle in.  Look at that.  Oh, Opie gets the big stand-up hug.  Wow.  Isn't that cool?  She's got some firm boobs, Anthony.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Two for Tuesday, Stone Temple Pilots, Wicked Garden and plush.  It's Opie, it's Anthony.  And it's Miss Korn.  And it's Laura Korn in the studio.  And what an appropriate song, Wicked Garden.  And then the Kornmeister shows up.  Yes! 
[38:00]
 I can't get enough sex.  The number one, shameless plug, sex author in America.  Just doesn't seem possible.  Seven years ago I never even had an orgasm.  And now I've had so many.  I mean, my God, I'm OG'd on orgasms.  All right, let me start by saying.  How many women are screaming my name out when they make love?  Thank you, Laura!  What?  Holy smoke!  Calm down, Laura.  He's out of the gate. 
[38:30]
 Calm down.  I'm proud.  I am the number one sex author.  I can't just let you go.  Where did you get your crystal meth from?  You're just saying you see my books everywhere, right?  Yes, I do, Laura.  I mean, they're everywhere.  But no one knows who you are.  We've got to give them a big intro and stuff.  You're an old friend of Aunt and I.  We go way back.  We do.  I've been doing your books for a long time.  I've been doing your books for a long time.  I've been doing your books for a long time.  I've been doing your books for a long time.  I've been doing yours for years in Boston.  That's right.  And we consider you one of our favorite guests of all time on the Open Anthony show.  Oh, thank you.  She enlightens people.  I enlighten.  She takes the monotony out of sex for couples that have been together for quite some time.  Yeah.  We add in some spice to a somewhat dull sex life a lot of people are having.  And on top of that, she looks like Barbara Eden, one of my fantasy girls from growing  up.  Yes, Master.  You look hotter than ever, man. 
[39:00]
 I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  You look hotter than ever, man.  Thank you.  Yeah, she's looking real good.  You know, I've got to take this.  I have a new book, right?  And I had done like a hundred.  The book that's the famous book, the number one sex book in America is 101 Nights of Girl. 
[39:30]
 That's three R's.  And you know, you love that book.  It's a great book.  But now I have a new book and I've been trying all these new things because that was a couple  years old.  I'd already done all that, right?  Yeah.  And so I've come up with 52 new techniques.  Well, I like your new techniques.  How could you possibly come up with that?  I know.  How could you possibly come up with that?  I know.  That's what I'm talking about.  What are you, at the Laura Korn laboratory, you know, trying to bend over a new way?  I just honestly come up with these things.  I don't know.  I was amazed.  You know what?  That's what I said.  Oh my God.  I've got to do another sex book because people keep going, we want more tricks, Korn? 
[40:00]
 I'll put my heel in my ear, all right?  Now I tug my hair between my legs and it, yeah, technique 53.  It's amazing.  She just keeps coming up with them.  When I thought of this book, I thought, you know, there's no way I'm going to come up  with 52, or, you know, I was going to do 101 more.  Right, wow.  But I couldn't.  That was impossible because I would have had to repeat myself.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you know what I mean?  So I said, okay, forget the 101.  Okay.  You know, I did a whole series on that.  Now I'm going to 52.  Did you try all these out first before you did? 
[40:30]
 I did.  I'm very proud of this one because I did every single one of them.  Wow.  All right.  And that, you know, that's why I look so good.  I guess so.  My head's been hanging banging on the headboard 52.  Who's the lucky guy?  It's the same guy.  Eight and a half years.  Eight and a half years.  You have the same guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Are you guys just like pounding every night?  No, not really.  Yeah.  You know, I'm saying, I'm thinking, to be really honest, yeah. 
[41:00]
 Well, he's the one that really invented the book for me.  Oh, really?  He's the one that kind of came up with the idea.  I went through a real long story, make a long story short.  I was like, it was like six weeks we hadn't had sex.  I was going through a really bad, no sex, which is really bad for a sex author.  Yeah, I guess so.  You really feel like a hypocrite, you know?  So everybody gets to it and you're like.  That's what they call a dry spell.  It's like Mark McGuire not hitting a home run, you know?  You were in a hump slump, is what they call it.  It was a big hump slump. 
[41:30]
 All right.  See, I'm coming in here, I can't talk.  Look at her.  Okay, so I was in definitely a hump slump.  So the guy's trying everything to get me to, you know, everything, you know, and if anybody  knows any of my books, all of the pages in 101 Nights at Great Sex are sealed, right?  They're sealed pages, yes.  They're sealed pages and I'd be in the kitchen and he'd be going, find the rib, come on,  I got a surprise for you.  And I'm not budging, I'm bored.  So you're the one that wasn't into it for the six weeks. 
[42:00]
 I was in this hump slump.  Hump slump, right?  And so all of a sudden, I kid you not, this is what the guy does.  He comes to my desk and I was busy, I was working on a project and he was dragging me down and  he puts a blue balloon on my desk and says, see this blue balloon?  I'm going, yeah, so what, it's a blue balloon.  He goes, that blue balloon, if you meet me in the vet on Saturday night, that's going  to make you levitate off the bed and not only that, that blue balloon is going to keep you 
[42:30]
 excited for three days after I boink you.  Get out of here.  And I'm like, no, boy, man, I'm like, oh yeah, yeah, you know, but here's what happens.  You're banging David Copperfield and then it'll burst and doves will fly out of your ass.  The imitation asks her to bring one blue balloon into the bedroom.  That's supposed to be great.  Well, it's going to keep her excited for three days after you have sex.  Three days?  I swear.  It's impossible. 
[43:00]
 Yes, no, it works.  You'll see.  Even if you hand over your credit card, you can't keep her excited for three days.  Three days?  Three days?  All right, let's go to the phones and see if someone could figure out what the blue balloon  trick is all about here.  Hello?  Hi, N.E.W.  How you doing?  Hi.  What's your name?  Todd.  Hey, Todd.  How are you?  I'm doing great.  All right.  Does it have anything to do with the G-spot?  Now, how are you going to do work the G-spot and the blue balloon at the same time? 
[43:30]
 Pressure point.  I mean, I was thinking if you were the position I was thinking of, yeah, with the pressure  on the G-spot.  And because I can't think of what else you can do because you can't use it for anything  else because it can break or.  So, the only thing I could think of would be pressure.  Okay, so how is that going to keep her excited for three days?  Well, the excitement would be the fact that she knows how to use a blue balloon without  her face.  You're really struggling here. 
[44:00]
 I think we're going to have to move on, man.  Good try, though.  Really good try.  Hi, N.E.W.  The blue balloon trick.  Hi.  Hello?  Hi.  All right.  You got an answer for us.  Yeah, I think you plant the blue balloon and you slowly let the air out onto her bicep  or what?  Oh, so you blow it up and then slowly.  You know the only way to slowly let air out of a balloon, though, I think it would ruin 
[44:30]
 the mood sounding like.  That feels good, doesn't it, honey?  I think I would ruin the mood.  Well, I mean.  Well, Laura, is he close or?  No cigar for you, sir. 
[45:00]
 But that was a good try.  To keep her excited for three days with a blue balloon.  With a blue balloon.  All right.  Now, I got to tell you, I'll give your audience a hint.  Okay.  All right.  Why did I see?  Remember my recipe?  Something plus something equals great sex.  Yes.  Something plus something equals great sex.  Oh, are we supposed to remember this?  Is this a pop quiz?  I didn't study now.  That could be a next question. 
[45:30]
 Wait a minute.  I got an idea.  Okay, what?  What?  Blow up the balloon pretty good, you know?  Put her right above her pussy on her stomach and then bouncer while you're getting her  from behind.  And do what?  Bouncer on a balloon.  Bouncer on a balloon.  You know, like a little kid riding on a balloon.  Bouncer on a balloon?  It's not a hoppity hop.  Why you got to be a bouncer on a balloon?  That way you don't do any work and push down her lower back.  Damn hoppity hop, bro.  Bouncer from behind.  You need an audience.  That's interesting.  We love an audience.  Come on.  Well, you know, it's creative.  See, this is what turns women on, the whole creative element here. 
[46:00]
 All right.  So, no.  Give us an idea.  I'll give you an idea.  I'll give you an idea.  I'll give you an idea.  I'll give you an idea.  I'll give you an idea.  I'll give you an idea.  All right.  So, no.  Give us a hint.  I'll give you a hint.  Okay.  I sealed the pages in all my books.  101 Nights at Great Sex, 101 Nights at Great Romance, 101 Great Winkies, and now 52.  Why did I seal the envelopes?  That's your hint.  Oh, surprise.  Oh, baby.  Oh, baby.  Now you're kidding me. 
[46:30]
 I hope this has nothing to do with such a tease.  She's paper cutting.  She just teases us.  Oh, God.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hi.  This is Greg.  Hey, Greg.  I think I might have the answer for the boo-boo.  All right.  Let her rip.  You get some static electricity going.  You need to use it on her body hair.  Oh, the whole hover technique?  I guess it might be.  What is the hover technique?  Oh, you don't know the hover technique?  That's when you're banging in a helicopter.  I heard of the hoover technique. 
[47:00]
 That's the hover technique.  Oh, you don't know what about hovering?  No.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's the hover technique.  Oh, you don't know what about hovering?  No.  Oh, this is really cool.  Check it out, guys.  This is really cool.  You know that skin makes up almost all of sex, right?  Uh-huh.  And most women have very fine hair on their arms and legs.  Exactly.  So you take them...  Except for Opie's first girlfriend that he had sex with...  Who, by the way, had hair all down her back like a Wookie.  Opie! 
[47:30]
 I love you.  Opie.  opi i lost his virginity to chewbacca from star wars she was hot but then i  turned over and she had like a mean i as well  you needed  you to raise any hair with static electricity you need to be that big big  remax hot air balloon  uh... robert on her back  like that  the hindenberg  but really the head on this  the  anyway okay  i think that i have a technique as you take your fingertips yeah and you 
[48:00]
 instead of the five you know woman with your fingertips you lightly touch her  hair and you just go up and down  her body with your fingertips and you have her over her skin so what's that  going from here  you know i don't know  why do so many women fake orgasms  hello i think i saw many men's fake for black  and that's what is this hover technique supposed to do what did i think that i 
[48:30]
 believe that the touch and it gives her a little bit spent all right so this  night that's a good thing to believe that they can simply not have anything to  do with electricity or average  uh... and i think that i have a good one by now we look at a balloon was it was  it is it like a round one of one of the year  well up in the cold like a big sausage i like that one and i think that i think  that we have to be a public right by any double your  hi am i on  uh... right  the anticipated 
[49:00]
 play eleven don't you if you have uh...  in the room and you have like great back and then you say like well  you know for three days just look at this balloon  you're really close  oh it's like a woman to get close  now there are a lot of guys listening to this program what's your name? Jennifer  are you married? yes i am ok if you got an invitation from your husband and his  name is? Evan.  Evan and he asked you to meet him in the bedroom you know he filled out the  invitation he mailed it to you. Right. You open it up and it's very sexy and asked you to 
[49:30]
 bring one blue balloon  i mean that alone. You're going to have an orgasm like reading it aren't you?  am i right? You just don't know what to expect especially when you're married.  But isn't that exciting? It is very exciting. It is. I'm telling you guys it works and guys are like  so you get all worked up. You worked? And it has nothing to do  She's close she didn't get it. You know what I'm going to send you a copy of the book because I like the way you think.  Are you with your husband right now? I wish I was. I heard the contest and I would definitely 
[50:00]
 he would definitely love to try. I'm telling you it will make him bigger and make him explode.  I'm telling you. Hey Laura, it's the dice man. I think I got a blue balloon. I know.  Because I understand what this girl is saying.  She equates the balloon to having this great sex and she just got a look at it  but there's something missing right? I know it's missing.  You fill the balloon with the vital fluid and it's almost like take out all week.  Did I hit the nail on the head? 
[50:30]
 You know it's like astronaut food for the rest of the week.  Right? I think I got that one right.  I'm getting mad at you. That's not right dice.  What's wrong with him?  You're so funny.  Are you going to give us the rest of the answer of the balloon?  I think if I give it away. It's not a technique. It's something that you do.  Listen to you.  Oh my. 
[51:00]
 Oh God.  You've got to give us something.  I'm going to give you a bunch of stuff to damn me.  It's a good little tease right?  Yeah it is a good tease.  I'm telling you guys get this book.

Valentine's Day is right around the corner guys and ladies.

 52 Invitations is a great sex.  So you want to try to find the couple now too?  Yeah let's do that.  I've got a lot of tips.  I'm going to give your audience at least four things that they could do tonight.  That will make them happy.  I think at this point we've got to tell you about our new club Laura.  We haven't seen you in a while.  It is Tuesday and Anthony and I started a club because we realized that the sex in a lot of relationships has gotten boring.  Maybe we got that from you.  I don't know.  But we came up with an idea called the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. 
[52:00]
 I like it.  So every Tuesday night there are couples out there joining our club.  And they're doing the Hummer on the guy?  Yeah and then the guy should reciprocate.  I do.  We understand that.  But a good ice breaker because after years of marriage or relationship it's so hard for a guy to ask for that.  And the girl doesn't usually volunteer the services.  So it just kind of goes to the wayside.  But now it gives an opportunity for a guy to go, hey listen to Opium Anthony.  And then he goes home and he goes, hey how about those wacky guys? 
[52:30]
 You hear them there.  Hummer Club.  Boy that's silly huh?  As the zipper is going down.  I like it.  We're opening the lines of communication with the couple.  And you know what?  I'm a big person when it comes to oral.  I mean I've got like 12, 15 Hummer pages in this book.  I'm really into that.  And both people become members of the club as well.  So the ladies don't feel like they're left out.  And then it's a cool little conversation piece on the weekends when you're at a party or something. 
[53:00]
 You're like hey man are you a part of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club?  And it's cool.  I think that's a great idea.  I think that's a great club.  And the guys in general love it.  I mean right now as we speak someone is joining the club on a highway somewhere.  Hummers.  Awesome.  So do they get any prizes when they call in and if they're actually doing the Hummer.  Just the satisfaction of getting the Hummer and becoming a member of the club is pain  enough.  And you know I've made the last two years of my life my goal to create different kinds  of Hummers. 
[53:30]
 Because the whole thing is you know the same old Hum is kind of boring after a while too.  I don't know even a bad one is a good one.  I know that is true.  But if you're going to Hum on her guys or if these guys.  There's so many different things you can do with your time.  Alright.  You want to find that couple?  I do.  Now what is the deal if we find this couple?  Go ahead.  You'll win the If Laura Korn Challenge, my new book 52 Invitations to Great Sex, 101  Nights of Great Sex, 101 Nights of Great Romance and 101 Great Quickies.  And I'll even throw my G-Spot video in. 
[54:00]
 And you want a couple that is willing to try out one of your techniques.  Yes.  And then report back to us when they're finished.  That's correct.  On how wonderful it was.  And this one is supposed to increase the size of the guy's unit.  Yes.  Not only increase it but give him the longest strongest orgasm of his life.  You're talking stuff that has been pondered since the beginning of time Laura Korn.  You have figured it out.  Cave paintings and they didn't figure this out.  But you know why?  Because you can't seal the pages of rocks.  Laura Korn has figured it out in her book to seal the pages.  They didn't know they were just leaving them out on stone wheels back then. 
[54:30]
 And for years I talked about the velvet tongue being the best oral trick.  And you guys know what the velvet tongue is.  I've outdone it this time.  Okay.  Who's this?  Who's this?  Who's this with the radio up real loud?  Turn your radio down.  Turn your radio down.  We're on delay.  Okay.  Turn your radio down.  We've got you live.  What do you got?  Hi.

They're crazy.  Do you have a favorite page that he's done to you?  That he's done to me.  Probably I like the painting one.  Tool time?  Tool time?  She's out of control.

[58:00]
 Alright hold on.  I didn't even know what I was getting myself into until he handed me the ball.  It's Laura Korn.  You may want to lock your kids in the bathroom for 15 minutes.  1027 WNEW the Rock of New York.  It's Sophie, it's Anthony and it's Laura Korn.  She just ran back into the studio.  She's so excited.  How was our couple?  Very excited?  Oh yeah.  The minute I said hello she was like oh you know which one we liked?  We liked three thumbs up.  We liked the ones with the three.  I mean she was just going over.  Three thumbs up?  Three thumbs up in the 101 nights of great sex book.  She was like just going on oh my god we like this one.  So she was all cute. 
[58:30]
 Alright so here's the deal.  We got a couple.  We got a couple.  We're going to do one of your techniques from the new book.  52 invitations to great sex.  And then we're going to.  Do we have their phone number so we can call them back?  Yes we do.  Okay.  We're going to call them back and find out how it went.  She sounded like a little firecracker.  She did.  She's very experimental.  I told her you know what this book.  This book I said I have to be honest.  I said this is even hotter.  This I know it doesn't seem possible but this book is about three notches hotter than the  other one.  Laura loves sex man. 
[59:00]
 I do.  Laura loves sex.  I do.  I love it and I love to write about it and this is a hotter book.  Now how happy is this guy going to be?  It's going to be the longest orgasm he's ever had?  I'm going to be very intense.  My name is not Cory.  Okay.  We're going to save my name is Cory.  It's a perfect day for this because of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  I think it's a great day.  And I got an instant email here real fast.  You did?  God bless your parents Opie and Anthony for having you.  My girlfriend finally broke down last Tuesday and I got my first Hummer in two years thanks  to you two and your Cory.  Congratulations.  Oh my God that's great. 
[59:30]
 Look how happy Laura is about this guy getting the Hummer.  That's a shame.  That's a crying shame.  That's why we started the club just to encourage the ladies and the guys to get together and  have a little fun just like when they first met.  Exactly.  When the sex was unbelievable.  I know.  Then all of a sudden something happens.  You have some kids and responsibilities and jobs and bills and you stop playing and you're  not having the fun sex anymore.  Right.  But people are tired.  They don't think they have the time to be creative.  So that's what's so cool about my book is you just rip out a sealed page and then you 
[60:00]
 seduce each other.  You've got some wacky ideas.  I do.  And right now I want to play with you guys.  What's inside the sealed envelope?  Or do you want me to do another sexual family feed question for your audience?  Well know what you need to do because a bunch of people have been calling and faxing and  emailing us saying that we should blow off some of the music today because you said you'd  give out some sex tips and you said you'd give us four.  We only have an hour left in our show so you've got to give us a good tip for the couples  that try tonight.  Okay here's one right now. 
[60:30]
 This is really cool.  All right.  All right.  What item.  Wait let me unzip.  Okay.  All right.  This is unbelievable.  And if you don't, I'll do a demonstration if we don't get it.  No one get it.  Okay.  What item commonly used in the sport of snow skiing will drive a woman to have a very intense  orgasm?  What item commonly used in the sport of snow skiing? 
[61:00]
 This is my first.  A stiff pole.  No.  Just thinking.  It is actually I'm telling you unbelievable.  Goggles.  Snow.  What item commonly used in the sport of snow skiing?  One of those wacky hats.  Zany hat.  A little tassels on it.  And this is something that everyone can afford and they can buy it.  You have to buy this. 
[61:30]
 All right.  Even if you're not a skier.  Right.  It's very inexpensive and you use this with your tongue or during sex.  Interesting.  And this is my first tip.  Hi, NAW.  NAW.  Hi, I'm still at home.  All right.  Well, we got you on the air now.  Oh, okay.  Hi.  Hi.  Well, I just wanted to correct the DJ.  I said a lot of wives, a lot of husbands have to ask wives for oral sex.  Yeah.  That's not true.  My husband and I have been married for three years. 
[62:00]
 We have a nine month old daughter.  Yeah.  And I must perform oral sex on him at least three to four nights a week.  Wow.  God bless you.  Now, obviously we're generalizing, but if you took a poll and asked a lot of guys, it  does take the poll.  They're just not getting it anymore.  That's the same.  You guys should know we have a nine month old.  She's a very active baby, but you know, we've got to take care of ourselves too.  Well, congratulations.  Thanks.  I'm serious.  All right.  Thank you. 
[62:30]
 You're welcome.  Another happy member of the club.  Hi, NW.  Yeah, I was on hold.  All right.  We got you on the air now.  What's up?  Hello?  Hey.  Did you want to take a guess at the question?  Did you hear the question?  No.  Okay.  All right.  This is Laura.  Yeah.  Laura.  Hi.  How are you?  I'm doing great.  Who's this?  This is Bobby.  Hi, Bobby.  We just got your book.  Which one?  Romantic something.  101 Nights of Great Romance? 
[63:00]
 Yes.  Cool.  Who got it?  My wife got it.  We just got married a couple months ago.  I'm a little skeptical of it though.  I mean, is it going to benefit me as well as her?  Well, what's romance for a guy?  What's romance for a guy?  I mean, here.  Here's the question.  What's romance for a guy?  You want romance for a guy?  Hey, Laura, it's me the Dice Man again.  I got your romance, huh?  I lay back with a beer cracked open.  I'm watching a good game and you can't quite see it because she's on your knees in front 
[63:30]
 of me.  Oh, Romance!  He grabs that mic from me and I can't stop him.  I apologize to the Dice Man, Laura.  Oh, that's funny.  You guys are great.  What can I tell you?  Yeah, go ahead.  Get her to rip out the one that's called Sleepless in the Saddle.  Okay.  Or how about the one that's called...  That's wacky.  Oh my God, save a horse, ride a cowboy. 
[64:00]
 Okay, wait a minute.  Okay, so that would get wet.  Get her to rip that one out.  I mean, a lot of the seductions in the romance book that she's going to do for you have to  do with sex.  Okay.  So yeah, you're going to score a big time.  Okay, great.  All right.  She's going to get what she needs, which is the seduction, and you're going to get what  you need.  Well, we're looking forward to it.  All right, cool.  All right, have a good one.  Bye.  We've got to get an answer to that question.  I know, I know.  So the ski item, we're looking for the item commonly used in the sport of snow skiing  to turn a woman on. 
[64:30]
 What is it?  All right, we got you on the air.  What's up?  I think it might be all cough drops.  Cough drops?  Yeah.  Is that commonly used in the sport of snow skiing?  No, but...  Oh.  I mean, that's a good trick too, but we're going to have to...  No, that's not it.  ...mentholated in a cough drop.  No, this is actually very cool.  I've got the item on me, as a matter of fact.  You do, so it's a small item.  I was going to blindfold one of you guys and try it.  It also works on a guy too.  Rock.  Okay, come on. 
[65:00]
 Hi, who's there?  I'm blindfolded.  Hi, this is Suzanne.  Hi, Suzanne.  How are you, Laura?  I'm doing great.  She's fine.  Can't you hear?  I bought your book, but my husband doesn't use it.  It's not...  So I was just telling the guy who ran through the book, sometimes it's not the woman with  the libido problem.  Right.  Did you know that 30% of all relationships, the woman wants it more?  Oh, my husband, I bought the book.  I kind of had to throw it away in a fit of rage, but anyway, I think it's Chad's stick. 
[65:30]
 She threw it away in a fit of rage.  I was so aggravated that we were not using it, so I flipped it.  I just do it right.  Can I tell you something?  Take the book and hit him over the head with it.  Okay, so you love the guy though, right?  Oh yeah, very much so.  You love him.  Yeah.  You have to be responsible for your own sex life too.  If you were ripping out the pages and having fun, then you should have continued.  You're right.  You're absolutely right.  You know what?  If you sit there and you go, why doesn't he do anything?  Why doesn't he? 
[66:00]
 You're never going to have a sex life.  True, true.  I mean, I'm so awesome.  Because you're either married to that kind of guy or you're not.  I got sick of doing it week after week, but the velvet tongue, I have to say, he loved.  That is...  Wow.  Yeah!  Of course.  That's an amazing technique.  See?  I got him in.  See?  See?  I would say a good two weeks.  Thank you very much.  So see?  So you did.  The velvet tongue is in your first book, right?  Yeah, 100 Writth and 1 9th.  That's the one that Heather told Evan Letterman about.  Oh really?  Yes.  Very good. 
[66:30]
 All right, we got to move on.  Thanks a lot.  Have a good night.  She thinks it's chapstick, by the way.  No, it's not chapstick.  Okay.  All right, we'll continue with the phone calls.  212-757-1027.  All right, it's open.  It's Anthony and it's Laura Korn.  We've got so much stuff going on here right now.  We've got a couple somewhere in Radio Land that is doing one of your techniques from  your company.  We're going to check in with them to see how that went.  And also, what is the trivia question that we need?  Okay, the trivia question.  We're looking for the answer.  You can win a copy of my new book.  There is an item commonly used in the sport of snow skiing that will make her orgasm amazingly  intense.  What is that item?  All right, give us a call.  212-757-1027.  And we'll reveal what that item is right after a twofer from the Rolling Stone.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, Twofer Tuesday with the Rolling Stone.  And we'll get to that in a minute.  All right, we'll get to that in a minute. 
[67:00]
 All right, we'll get to that in a minute.  All right, we'll get to that in a minute.  All right, we'll get to that in a minute.  Rolling Stone's love is strong from Voodoo Lounge and Gimme Shelter.  It's Opie, it's Anthony and it's our sexpert Laura Korn.  We love Laura.  She's one of our favorite guests of all time since Anthony and I have been doing radio  together for the last five years.  She's such a tease, man.  Such a tease. 
[67:30]
 Would you rather be teased or not teased at all?  Be honest.  I love being teased.  We all love being teased.  Being teased is great.  And that's part of the problem.  When people move in, they stop teasing.  Right?  You stop teasing and that's what all my products are about, the big tees.  I still tease, but it's in a different way.  Having tees.  Like now, I just repeat everything my wife says right after she says it.  She finds it real annoying and says, stop teasing me.  It's a little different.  I got a blue balloon.  Yeah, honey, look, I got a blue balloon and then I'll take it and keep rubbing it until 
[68:00]
 it goes eee while she's trying to watch TV.  That's me teasing her.  We're still trying to get the answer to the blue balloon, but we're way past that.  We're way past that.  All right, what's the section?  Okay, we're looking for the item commonly known in the sport of snow skiing to turn  a woman on.  What is it?  All right, let's go to the phones here.  Hi, N.A.W.  Yeah, would it be the heat pad?  Yeah, man!  Oh, wow!  The heat pad!  Have you ever tried it?  No, I don't think I can come up with one.  Okay, so what you do is you take some Saran wrap and you put it around the heat pad. 
[68:30]
 And it's like right in the palm of your hand, right?  Right.  Okay, so it's the element of surprise.  You're in a bed with a bunch of heat pads hanging out of your nose and stuff all over  your body.  So she doesn't know you have them.  So you're down there humming.  All right, you're licking.  All right.  And on the slide, remember, everything is the element of surprise.  You just put that heat pad, because women, through PMS and everything, we always put  heat pads, you know?  So you put it right above her pubic bone or right on that magic spot.  And you just kind of rub, rub, rub, lick, lick, rub, lick, rub, lick, rub, lick, woo! 
[69:00]
 Scraper off the ceiling.  Wow, look at that, huh?  There you go, a sex tip from Laura Korn.  Isn't that cool?  Only took an hour and a half.  You fake tease, yo.  You only want to do this a couple of times a month, you know, tricks like this.  But it is very cool.  Can you see how that would work?  Yes.  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah, and you can do it during foreplay.  If she's flipped over on her back, just go up.  You could get something cold in one hand, hot, and just go up and down her spine.  Hot, cold, hot, cold. 
[69:30]
 Oh my God.  Look at her.  She's getting all worked up just thinking about it.  It is.  It is.  It's very cool.  I love that, that heat thing on a woman's magic button.  Okay.  Guys.  Hello.  Hello.  I'm having an orgy.  What a big one.  All right, so.  Here I go.  All right, that's one.  You promised a few more tips here, Laura.  Yes, okay.  Good thing for guys.  Listen up, for Valentine's Day.  Uh-huh.  Valentine's Day, you're going to do flowers?  No.  You're not going to do flowers?  A lot of guys are going to do it, but yeah, you might.  You do that, but you know something else. 
[70:00]
 What's the most unusual way you've given a woman flowers?  This is a great tip, guys.  She will be blown away.  Well, I use my ass as a vase and come in on my hands.  Unusual way to give flowers.  You got unusual ways to give flowers?  Very good.  Okay, you know what?  It's effort behind the gesture.  It's called the EBG.  Okay.  EBG, EBG, EBG.  Always remember this, guys, because you score points. 
[70:30]
 EBG.  EBG.  Effort behind the gesture.  Everyone does something nice for you, right?  Don't you, whether it's what you see, the effort behind the gesture.  Of course.  Women always do this.  So when you walk in and you just bought some flowers off the corner, she's happy, but it's  not like there's no thought.  Nice gesture, but the effort isn't that much.  Right.  Okay, here's the cool thing to do for Valentine's Day.  She will love you.  She will give you a hummer, guaranteed.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  All right?  Listen up.  All right, spell a message with flowers.  Let's say our name is Carol.  I love you, Carol. 
[71:00]
 The I is an iris.  The L is a lily.  The O is an orchid and so forth and so on.  Spell a message with flowers, put it in a card and give it to her and she will keep  it for the rest of her life.  What do you mean put it in a card?  Well, put the I, right, right, I for the iris, L for love, O and then let her guess all evening  why these flowers are so special.  I mean, she'll spend all evening trying to guess why these flowers have significance.  Okay.  And what you've done is you've spelled out a special, you know, message with flowers. 
[71:30]
 And that is a, it doesn't take any more time to call the florist and do this than it would  to order, you know, a dozen red roses.  What?  Flowers starts with an F. Right?  You know, carnation.  I got that.  It's very cool.  Isn't that cool?  I'm telling you guys, big points.  Big points.  All right.  It's different.  It's different.  Okay, your new book is called 52 Invitations to Great Sex.  What's the phone number again?  Oh, it's 1-800-547-BONK.  Okay.  And you're going to be in the book for a while.  I'm going to be in the book for a while.  I'm going to be in the book for a while.  I'm going to be in the book for a while.  Okay. 
[72:00]
 So, what's the phone number again?  Oh, it's 1-800-547-BONK.  B-O-N-K.  547-BONK.  People are calling wanting to know about the velvet tongue.  It is in 101 Nights of Great Sex and it's number five.  Okay.  We got the couple on hold.  Oh, we do?  We're going to talk to them next, okay?  Okay.  1027-W-N-E-W.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.

[72:30]
 But right now we got the couple on the line, Laura, that you talked to off the air.  Uh-huh.  One of the techniques from the book.  Uh-huh.  It's an oral technique, right?  It's an oral technique and they consider that she says that she's really good with her tongue  and she's very experimental, yet she had never tried this technique.  This technique.  And I did say that if it didn't give him the best orgasm of his life, the longest, and if  it says, Mr. Friendly didn't get the biggest it's ever been.  My name wasn't Gord.  This is just astounding that Laura Korn could come up with something that has been tried 
[73:00]
 for years.  It's the oral Viagra.  It's oral Viagra.  All right.  What's our couple's name again?  We're using fake names.  Pierre and.  Monique.  Monique, was it?  Yes.  It doesn't involve an air pump and a rubber band or anything.  Pierre.  Hello.  Oh, Pierre.  Oh.  Who loves you, Pierre?  Who's looking after you?  Who's taking care of you?  The Korn is.  Wait a minute.  Is my name still Korn?  I don't know who it is.  Look, this guy's flustered.  No more blood in his head.  He's talking like a retard.  I'm white.  Are you white? 
[73:30]
 Yeah, white.  Okay, now we can't reveal the technique, but.  Oh, yeah.  Not saying.  But she'd never done this before.  No.  And was it, did it get big?  Yeah.  It got big.  All right.  Like bigger than normal?  Well it's bigger than normal anyway, but.

Absolutely.  Because I want to ask her.

 Okay, I've got to ask her something right off the bat.  All right, hold on.  Okay.  Here she is.  Hello?  What was that?  We love you.  It was really good.  We've been waiting for you to call for like ten minutes.  Oh my God.  So now let me ask you.  Now when you did this technique.  All right, because there are a lot of men and women.  We're teasing them right now.  But did you see an immediate reaction? 
[75:00]
 Absolutely.  I mean, all the blood went.  Right.  And it was like.  Yeah.  And he even asked me to do one of the things again.  He said, can you do that same one again?  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  And then when I quit.  No, I know, I know.  And then when I quit, that was it.  Oh man.  I feel like I'm listening to The View.  The Open Anthony Show has turned into the Lifetime Show.  Oh my goodness.

[76:00]
 Yes.  And this technique is in the book.  Number one, it's stand back.  For those people listening.  Oh, that's the one I read.  Stand back.  I don't know how big this is going to get.  Don't let them tease you.  They're just jealous.  My husband's five pounds lighter, he said.  Wow.  I found lighter, huh?  Get him to do the blue balloon for you for Valentine's Day.  Okay.  That's the one, all right?  Thank you.  All right.  All right.

We got to give our listeners something here.  Okay.  Well, should we do the fetish thing?  Okay.  We can do that.  You want to do that?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm going to ask you right off the bat.  What is the only known aphrodisiac guys?  The only known.  The only known aphrodisiac.  Oysters?  No.  Maybe you want to do that question.  It's going to be a Laura Korn trick question.

And I was making a point of the, you know, oral, the tongue and variety.  Do you agree?  Yes.  Let me write that down.  Variety.  I forget.  Variety.  When is the pop quiz?  Variety.  You don't want to do a round of what's in the pop quiz. 
[78:00]
 You don't want to do a round of what's inside the seal page.  And warmers.  We'll do that.  But I'm going to ask a question.  Yeah, give a question for the listeners.  All right.  Call in either question.  The number one male fetish or the number one female fetish.  And we're not talking fantasies.  Okay.  We're talking fetish.  What is your definition of a fetish?  A fetish.  A fetish.  Something that really gets you hot.  Yes.  Yeah.  Like overly so.  Right.  It's like a fetish.  You're consumed with it.  Number one fetish for guys.  For guys?  For guys one is. 
[78:30]
 Dismembered bodies, right?  Maybe I've went out too far on a limb here.  And you'll give these answers out, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  1027-W-A-W, the Rock in New York.  It's Hopi.  It's Anthony.  It's Laura Coyne.  We're having a great time here in the studio today.  Yeah.  People seem to be loving all the stuff we're talking about.  Look at this, Hopi.  On the instant feedback, Tom from Bethpage.  Hey guys, I haven't had sex in weeks.  I stopped by a bookstore on the way home, picked up Laura's book.  My first sex invite is in the mail. 
[79:00]
 I used sex invite number two.  It involves a hanger, a scarf, a vibrator, candles.  This is awesome.  Thanks, Laura.  This guy couldn't wait to eat.  Actually, it's sealed page number two.  It's called She's Out of Control.  Yeah, I see that in there.  And it's number two.  And he actually mailed the invitation to his wife already.  Cool.  That guy's horny.  Okay, here's the question.  All right, we've got two questions.  What is the number one male fetish and what is the number one female fetish? 
[79:30]
 If you can answer either one of those questions, you'll want a copy of 52 Invitations to Great  Side.  And we've got to give out the number again because the instant feedback is going nuts.  1-800-547-BONK.  B-O-N-K.  So order any of Laura's books.  The Rock of New York, 1027-WNEW, Two for Tuesday with Hendrix, Dolly Dagger, and Crosstown  Traffic.  It's Hopi, it's Anthony, and it's Laura Korn who's making me tired, Anthony.  I'm exhausted.  I feel like I just did three hours in the sack with Laura. 
[80:00]
 You are a hyper person.  I know.  Hey, when did you get started in the wonderful world of sex, Laura?  Well, eight years ago.  That's when you did it for the first time?  Well, I didn't have an orgasm until seven years ago.  Are you kidding?  I swear to God.  And I didn't really dig sex, and so I went to the library where all good girls go and  they don't have orgasms.  Is that something?  I started reading books, and I just self-taught myself.  Self-taught?  I like to watch those little lessons. 
[80:30]
 Trying out different recipes.  And my next book is 101 Nights of Getting My Self Off.  Yay!  That's a best seller.  All right.  Now, we've got 20 phones led here.  Okay.  We're trying to get the answer to what question again?  What is the most popular male fetish?  No, we're not talking fantasy.  It's a fetish.  And what is the most popular female fetish?  Okay.  Who's this?  It's all of us.  What's up, buddy?  Yeah, what's going on?  Is the most popular female fetish cosmetic? 
[81:00]
 Cosmetic?  No, it's something that really turns women on when it comes to the male gender.  Okay.  Andy W.  Hi, how are you doing?  Good.  You got an answer?  Going great.  I'd like to say from men, it's feet.  Yes!  You're right!  Wait, wait, wait.  You guessed feet.  It's the foot fetish, but now I'm going to ask you a tougher question.  Describe the sexiest shoe according to men.  What does it look like? 
[81:30]
 Um, like, just, what does, alright.  I want you to describe the shoe.  Full description now.  Yes.  Big bunny slippers.  Um, a stiletto with like the ankle strap across the very top of your ankle.  It's a horseshoe.  Like very high.  You're talking whore pumps, honey, huh?  I bet you got a few in your closet, don't you?  Sorry, Dice got the mic.  Okay, so an open toe.  Open toe, you're right. 
[82:00]
 That's what it, the open toe, you know why?  They can't kick you in the ass out the door with it?  I don't know.  Why?  I don't know.  Toe cleavage.  Oh, okay.  Those are four slips.  I've already heard that if you're going to buy shoes, you want to show like the cleavage.  I've got to disagree with all of this.  This is grossing me out.  We're talking pretty feet.  We're talking pretty feet.  No, I'm not.  No, no.  Attractive feet.  Wrong.  We're talking about cleavage.  Out of all the fetishes, you come up with this?  This is stuff that is turning me off. 
[82:30]
 Toe cleavage, toe cheese.  Toe cleavage, yeah.  Fine.  Toe cleavage.  You obviously are not foot fetish guys.  No, when I'm walking down the street, I'm not looking at cleavage going, look at her  toes open.  Look at the set of toes on her.  Wow, look at that.  You think they're real or fake?  Yeah, I think she's had big toe implants.  Come on.  I don't know. 
[83:00]
 Look, she's wearing that sheer sock.  I think I see nails.  Laura, I'm not buying it.  I'm not buying it.  I think that's a woman's idea of what the man's fetish is.  That I could buy, but it's not the actual man's fetish.  Well, wait a minute.  Rick, she got herself all worked up.  Her headphones are twirled around her seat.  Oh, look, she's okay.  I think she's trying out a new technique with her headphones.  It's called wrap the wire around your seat. 
[83:30]
 Now, Laura, I can't accept that as the fetish.  Okay, now I'm...  Number one fetish for guys is feet.  Okay, well that's what it is.  It's a foot fetish.  We're not talking fantasy.  We're talking fetish, and that's, I guess, where the definition is.  And it comes from a book called Sexy Origins.  And this is where people get...  I mean, it's origins from sexual...  And that shoe is the type of shoe to the hunt...  No, no, no.  It's the open toe shoe.  The true foot fetish guy wants to see the toes. 
[84:00]
 And they surmise it's because of the cleavage, because of the slits.  He's a toe man.  I'm a heel man myself.  Well, I mean, it's high heels.  I like the arch.  All right, so we got the answer to that.  Let's put her on hold.  Oh, God, you want a copy?  All right, she's on hold.  Line two.  Line two, Rick.  She gets a book.  A woman...  That's a woman...  I think that's a woman's version of a man's fetish.  Because that's acceptable.  Well, what do you think is the fetish, then? 
[84:30]
 If you don't think it's toes, guys, Opie and Anthony, what's the fetish, you think?  All right, what do you think?  What do you think?  Because a worship of breasts is really not a fetish.  No, but I mean, even a tummy is closer than a foot to being something that a guy would  look at and maybe touch and feel all tingly about.  Then the foot...  I mean, the foot is part of the whole package.  Like a completely nude woman.  And hey, there's her feet.  You know, and there's her head and there's everything in between. 
[85:00]
 But you know, I'm not looking open-toed shoe.  Yeah, that's good.  You're my little buster brown, aren't you?  You know, doesn't work for me.  Doesn't work.  All right, so now we need to get to the bottom of this.  All right, so now we need to find out the number one fetish for ladies, right?  The number one fetish for ladies?  Yes, and this really is...  The number one fetish for ladies?  Yeah, this is amazing.  See, you got answers to that question, bro.  Yeah.  Am I on? 
[85:30]
 Yeah.  Yeah, you're okay.  Cool, I wasn't sure.  Too bad the girl beat me.  The guy beat me four.  Actually, the girl beat me four.  I'm not even sure about the foot fetish.  I was going to guess that, but...  You're going to guess that?  As far as the woman goes, I'm going to say hand.  So you think of...  Well, it's true.  We do look at the hand.  I get compliments.  Only when they got credit cards in them.  I do.  All right, hands is not the answer, I'm assuming.  No, no.  All right, thanks for trying, man.  All right, man.  Okay.  Actually, someone in this room guessed this a while ago.  A while ago?  But I didn't acknowledge it.  Oh.  No, that's a hit.  Go ahead.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hi, how you doing? 
[86:00]
 Doing great.  Good.  Listen, Laura, one question.  Sure.  What book is that chapter for Stand Back?  That's...  Because I'm going to buy it tomorrow.  See you later.  See you later.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. 
[86:30]
 Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.
