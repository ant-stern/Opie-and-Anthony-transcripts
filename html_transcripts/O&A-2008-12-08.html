<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about sports, focusing on the poor performance of the New York Jets and Dallas Cowboys, contrasting them with the New York Giants' success.  Sean Avery's mandated NHL sensitivity training was mocked extensively.  The hosts then provided cynical commentary on O.J. Simpson's sentencing, focusing on the judge's pronouncements and Fred Goldman's reaction. A caller, Sam, shared a lengthy anecdote about his father's eccentric lifestyle and impressive mustache, dominating the latter part of this segment. The segment concluded with a discussion about gas prices and car maintenance. Throughout this section, the hosts utilized offensive language and humor, including derogatory terms for people with disabilities, homophobic slurs, and misogynistic comments.

The show continued with a discussion of the hosts' car preferences, their XM/Sirius radio choices, and their fondness for SUVs.  The conversation transitioned to Barack Obama's incoming presidency, his perceived economic reticence, and speculation about his smoking habits. A clip of an evasive Obama interview regarding smoking cessation was played, followed by a debate about smoking's inclusion in movie ratings and White House smoking policies.  A listener then called about a woman with unusual back hair, sparking a graphic discussion of body hair, sexual experiences, and pre-shaving-era sexual encounters.  Further listener calls followed, delving into the rarity of this hair condition.

A listener brought up Joe Satriani's lawsuit against Coldplay for copyright infringement over "Viva La Vida," prompting the hosts to play both songs. Another potential Coldplay ripoff by Creaky Boards was mentioned by a caller.  A listener-suggested contest, "Miss Rotten Crotch," was introduced, generating numerous calls with varied reactions. The segment concluded with the introduction of a 38-year-old intern, sparking discussion about career changes and the hosts' diverse opinions on Sleeves' repetitive "la la la" song, "Christmas Song."

A significant portion of the show focused on the aforementioned "la la la" Christmas song by Sleeves. Opie enjoyed it, while Anthony vehemently disliked it. Listeners called in with their opinions, and the discussion veered into tangents, including listener comments and discussions about other artists like the Police, Veruca Salt, Screaming Trees, Nirvana, Alice in Chains, and Hall & Oates. Opie shared a near-encounter story involving Veruca Salt. Jimmy, a regular staff member, was present in studio.

The show then shifted to a discussion of homemade wine received from listeners "Dr. Steve" and "Steve from Bayshore." Opie, Anthony, and producer Sam vulgarly mocked the wine's quality, using highly offensive language to describe its smell and taste.  Steve from Bayshore's laziness and methods of acquiring the wine were also mocked. The hosts then opened a Christmas gift from Caroline's Comedy Club, expressing disappointment with the inexpensive contents.  The segment concluded with the playing of Andy Samberg's "Jizz in My Pants" and Nirvana's cover of "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," followed by a WebEx sponsor plug.  Throughout the broadcast, the hosts frequently used offensive language and crude humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Can we do retard of the day?  Mongoloid of the day, please, let's do it.  Can we start?  We'll start with E-Rock just to keep it to the air.  You ever do the chicken dance in a wake?  That really bothers me.  Especially if it's a child's wake.  That little teeny coffin.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:00:30]  Stupid Jets, good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hi.  My effing Jets.  I decide, you know what, I want to start really rooting for these guys.  And of course they start losing.  Of course they do.  Well, I had a wonderful football day too yesterday.  Cowboys?  What happened?  Your team.  I was, I remembered why I walked away from sports. 
[00:01:00]  It hurts too much.  Got the Giants in though.  Their, uh, their loss.  Oh, okay, good.  Yeah.  There's not one big blue fan among us, right?  Uh, I'm a bandwagon hopper with the Giants.  You don't like the Giants.  I know.  I don't even follow football.  But since they're, you know, they're, what are they, 11-2 or something?  Something like that?  Yeah.  So I've been kind of, peripherally kind of keeping my eye on them so I can see if they're 
[00:01:30]  good enough for me to be a bandwagon jumper.  Because a team's got to be good.  Yeah.  You don't bandwagon jump on a crap team or a crap season.  So I'm, I'm ready to, uh, get my big blue jersey and, uh, brand new.  You know, get, get a jersey of a player's name that I don't even know that's still stiff  because it's all brand new.  Right from, I gotta go to Moe's and get it.  Gotta get to Moe's.  And I'll just be a bandwagon jumper.  At least have some guts.  Get a, uh, uh, a Burris one. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, yeah, okay.  That, that I could do.  Yeah, that would be cool.  Probably all sold out.  Yeah.  I'll tell you this much about the Giants.  What the F was Michael Strahan on when he was playing?  Because now that he's a commentator, he looks like a little man.  He looks like a little man.  I'm not saying he was on the Roids.  I have no idea.  Yeah.  But he was on something.  Because he's a lot smaller than when he was playing for the Giants.  Has anyone taken a Burris jersey and, um, down to the range? 
[00:02:30]  Just blast some holes in a barrel like that?  Oh my God.  That'd be kind of fun.  You hang it up.  Especially with, like, a 50 cal or something.  Just blast holes in it and then just wear that to the game.  When he checked into the hospital, he used the name Harris Smith.  And so a bunch of guys have gone out.  Jimmy uses when he checks in, uh, in hotels and doesn't want people to know.  Guys have started buying the jersey, the 17, and putting Harris Smith on the back.  And the league had to halt sales.  Why?  Yeah.  Because they think it's, uh, tarnishing the image of the NFL. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, shut up.  The NFL.  Where everyone, where most linebackers die before they hit 52 years old.  Yeah.  They're all pumping steroids and whatever they could find into them until they ban that substance.  That league.  Teams ravaged by crime.  That league.  A bunch of criminals.  The league where the average player plays maybe two seasons and then don't, they don't know what to do with their lives.  Bye-bye.  That league where the NFL helps everyone, sure.  Go after yourself.  Go to the old blew-your-knees-out hotel. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  With the rest of the guys you don't remember the names of.  Please.  Sports has got to get back to where it used to be.  Enough with this family friendly.  You hear about Sean Avery.  He agreed to go to, uh, what, what, what, what, what?  Don't say it.  He agreed to go to, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Sensitivity training?  Yes.  Oh, no.  You know, if that doesn't show that we've been there and it's such crap, he doesn't want to go. 
[00:04:00]  It's going to do nothing for him.  Well, that's what the commish told him to do.  Sean Avery doesn't want to go to sensitivity training.  I hate Sean Avery, but I have to support him in this one.  I'm a huge Islander fan, but Sean Avery did.  I thought that was so cool doing the sloppy seconds thing.  Yeah.  And that takes sensitivity training.  And it came out, I think, on Friday after our show that he agreed to take some sensitivity  training classes.  He didn't agree to nothing.  You ever do something in your car that's a little screwy and they make you take a class? 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Like, I've never, I've never had to take a class, but if you get too many tickets, you  could take a class to get points off.  Or I guess if you get a D-Wees, they put you in a class and stuff like that.  Do you think anyone sitting there leaves those classes and goes, you know, I feel more  educated now and I feel better about, and I do really feel that I wasn't doing the right  thing.  You sit there, you look at each other and make that, oh, well, I'm here too face to everyone 
[00:05:00]  else.  Because I think I went to something like that.  It was a driver's ed class that the school didn't give.  But you had to go to it if, like, because my license was suspended because I hadn't  paid tickets or something.  This is years and years ago.  But I went to this class and everybody just looks around like, oh, you're here too, huh?  Of course.  You're looking at your watch for when the next break is so you can go out and smoke.  Even the person giving the class doesn't give a crap. 
[00:05:30]  You look around the classroom to see who's carrying.  I think I can get some good pot off that dude in the corner.  Yeah, you get some weed.  Some weed.  Who's that chick?  Who's the chick?  What did she do?  Who's got the pills?  You know, it has nothing to do.  And I'm sure sensitivity training is the same thing.  You're sitting around, you're looking around going, oh, God, what did you do?  Would you drop the N-bomb?  All right, you call someone a fan.  You're this.  You know, it just, it doesn't work.  Knowing a little bit about Sean Avery, I bet you he chokes out the teacher in sensitivity 
[00:06:00]  training class.  It's actually worse.  They've told him he has to take an anger management evaluation.  And this is a guy who plays hockey for a living.  Evaluation?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Makes complete sense.  And a six-game suspension without paying.  Yeah, this is the league where I went to the Islander game on Saturday.  We have a horrendous goalie.  The team's better than our record, but whatever.  And I saw some of the most amazing fights, one where there was a choke out and the guy  was slammed down the ice like it's a WWE, but Sean Avery has to take anger management 
[00:06:30]  classes.  Yeah.  Go screw.  The commissioner should go screw.  Pardon me.  Could I have that puck?  I was going to slam you into the boards, but I'll just ask nicely now.  Unbelievable.  What do you think of that?  It's a waste of time.  It's typical of what we are as Americans.  Yes.  We like to sweep stuff under the carpet, pretend that we don't think the same way.  We're just a country of pussies.  And the symbolism over substance is running rampant. 
[00:07:00]  It's one of those, hey, let's send them to anger management.  We'll tell everybody we did that.  Meanwhile, it means nothing, but it looks good.  It sure looks good.  Yeah.  What happened to your Cowboys?  I kind of jumped because I could give a crap about the Cowboys.  They have a woman as a quarterback.  That's what happened with them.  Well, you know they call them homo, right?  As they should.  I was down in Philly watching the game, and there was a little fantasy football final going on.  So they were rah-rah in the Philly crew house, and they're yelling and screaming, 
[00:07:30]  HOMO!  Come on, homo!  Oh, no.  Well, it was 3-3, and then Dallas went up 10-3.  And I think they went up 13-3.  And then the defense played great.  Great.  They had that stupid Pittsburgh quarterback.  What's his name?  Roethlisberger?  Yeah.  They had that nerd face first in the dirt.  Yeah.  Constantly.  Constantly. 
[00:08:00]  So what happened?  He finally got a big 46-yard pickup, and they got in the end zone, and they scored.  And they went, then it was like 13-10, and then what you need is a quarterback who doesn't  have a vagina.  Okay?  What you need is a quarterback who has winning instincts and can win big games.  And I know he's a good regular season quarterback, but he's not a big game quarterback, and he  never will be.  So what happens is, I think they went three and out.  And I think Pittsburgh got the ball back and then kicked the field goal. 
[00:08:30]  Pittsburgh tied it.  And then I think that Sissy Cuckboy threw an interception, and the ball was run back into  the end zone.  I think Pittsburgh scored twice in 20 seconds.  Wow.  Or something like that.  Oh.  And then he went, I think, four and out on the next one when we needed him big.  And just the same way he screwed up on that snap, he's not a big game quarterback.  He's not.  Yeah.  Makes me sick.  There you go.  I hate him. 
[00:09:00]  Steel is 20, Cowboys 13.  Now he's relaxing, a little Midol to help him out.  He really is.  I bet that was his problem.  He was probably bloated, and he felt fat.  His breasts were swollen, and they were tender, and he didn't feel like he looked cute in his  uniform.  Yeah.  Makes me sick.  The linemen were telling him he looked fat in that uniform, and he got all upset.  Yeah, and a tizzy.  He was mad because Terrell Owens was wearing the same thing he was wearing.  Hey, right on. 
[00:09:30]  It was awful.  They even heard him, too.  After the interception, he marched off angrily.  That bitch.  How could he be a Cowboys fan?  Since childhood, man.  I know.  My first memory was Super Bowl XIII, losing a dirty Pittsburgh, 35-31, because of Jackie  Smith.  Let's say hi to Ian in Canada.  Ian, how are you?  Yeah, I'm waking up.  I just wanted to comment on these repeat offenders in the NHL.  I'm loving this whole Avery thing up here, boys. 
[00:10:00]  Like Ryan Hallway, Chris Simon, Chris Pronger.  All these guys go out and freaking destroy guys.  You know, Chris Simon pretty well can't even play another game in the league.  Ryan Hallway, I mean, they never had to go to anger management.  See you later, bud.  I love Chris Simon.  Who is he playing for these days?  The Islanders used to have him.  Imagine, like, in the day, if they told, like, Clark Gillies he had to go to anger management.  Right. 
[00:10:30]  It's stupid.  That'd be like, what?  It is so stupid.  Give him the old Planet of the Apes brain lobotomy thing, because that's the only way  that's going to work.  You know what?  They wanted to make hockey family friendly.  Look, they got Disney on ice for the kids.  Bring them to the Coliseum.  That's it.  You want to see nice skating?  Do a little Disney on ice for the kids, and then you, as an adult, go with your buds  and watch some blood and guts being, you know, poured out onto the ice.  Enough with this family friendly crap.  It's competitive, real hockey.  Right.  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  And I'm sitting at the game with my little nephew, and my brother's, like, right on with  his son, like, check this out.  There's, like, old school hockey.  Just, they're loving it.  Because he knows this kid can handle a stupid fight on the ice.  And what was the crowd doing?  Just loving it, right?  Loving it!  Why would you take that away from the crowd?  It's not like people are horrified and saying, please stop this.  I shan't return to another game.  They're loving it.  Give the fans what they want to see. 
[00:11:30]  That's what the whole thing's about.  Oh, people get, ugh.  Who's, who's, who's the geniuses that get behind and go, no, no, no, we've got to turn  this around and make this family friendly.  I think it's, it's, it's marketing.  Yes.  And, you know, they're trying to make a little extra dough.  Oh, so they could get everything sponsored.  You know what I noticed?  Sponsors won't come on board if it's too violent.  You know what I noticed at the Islander games, because I'm a half season ticket holder.  I shouldn't call it a season ticket holder. 
[00:12:00]  I go to half the games.  They used to do the chicken dance to get the crowd, you know, going.  No, no, no, no, they didn't.  Well, no, I know.  No, they didn't.  There was one reason they played the song.  No, that's just, no, it's actually cool.  So they could start their, the Rangers suck chant, right?  It started out as a cute little thing, I guess, but the fans figured out, well, we're going  to turn this cute little thing into another way to, you know, make.  The Rangers suck, the Rangers suck, the Rangers suck.  Suck, suck, suck, suck, suck.  Okay.  Guess what? 
[00:12:30]  They don't play the song anymore at the Coliseum.  And guess what the reasoning was?  The Rangers suck.  Yeah.  Which the entire freaking Coliseum would get into.  It wasn't like a group of drunks, you know, in the nosebleeds.  It was the entire place screaming at the top of their lungs, the Rangers suck.  Competitive, camaraderie, all the things that make sporting events fun.  And trust me, the same thing with the Islanders stuff at the Ranger games.  I understand that.  And I think that's fine, too. 
[00:13:00]  But I'm sure Madison Square Garden took a few little ditties away because it's a little  too mean-spirited against the Islanders.  It's just a joke.  There's so much money.  It's almost like everyone wants the money.  We all want it, too, just as performers, as people in radio or in comedy or in sports.  So the thing is, to get that kind of money, you have to deal with these giant corporations  even more.  Like Bank of America sponsors this or that bank sponsors that.  So by dealing with these giant corporations, you have to deal with their crap.  And it's sickening.  It's just sickening. 
[00:13:30]  We were thinking, yeah, the banks come in or the big corporations are like, you know,  we really love what's going on and being a team.  But is there something we could do about the chicken dance chant thing?  Because it's really not the image we want to portray for our company.  Please.  By the way, for the people out there, Chris Simon, who used to be on the Islanders, he  now plays for the Minnesota Wild or whatever, this guy, Chris Simon would get into the ugliest 
[00:14:00]  fights in recent years.  He would get suspended for like 10 games at a time.  Nice.  Then he would finally come back and you would have a ticket like, oh my God, Chris Simon's  finally coming back.  And then you'd sit there and watch him just beat the living crap out of somebody else  and have to sit out another 10 games.  I think he's been brought up on murder charges or like assault charges.  He's just the greatest man.  And the Islanders finally had to get rid of him.  Like, look, you only play like four or five games a year in between your suspension. 
[00:14:30]  But people were psyched to stay on the ice when he got a ticket to a game he was playing.  Oh, it ruled.  Oh, wow.  It ruled.  It's good to know that he's still playing somewhere because hockey needs more Chris  Simons.  I'm going to take a quick break.  We're just getting started.  Yeah.  O.J. Simpson, that went down after our show on Friday, huh?  What happened?  Wow.  Tell me what his wife.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Well, what I like is the Goldman's there. 
[00:15:00]  Ah, yeah.  I like, you know, Fred is just, wow.  They were sitting there watching, yeah.  Nothing is good enough for this man.  And I like that.  It's true.  I mean, you know, they were, well, we'll talk about that.  Yeah, of course.  That and Obama.  Is he quitting smoking?  Is he not?  He's opening up the White House.  He's got all sorts of things going on.  Yeah.  And other things.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony, phone number 877-212-ONA.  Just getting started. 
[00:15:30]  We're also on Sirius XM satellite radio, by the way.  Am, am, am.  Someone out there got it.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  I have to update my Chris Simon info.  First of all, this Chris Simon, who used to play for the Islanders, and just a bad, bad  boy, because we're talking about Sean Avery and how he has to take anger management classes  so he could continue his career with the NHL, you know, the cute little NHL league. 
[00:16:00]  So lame.  Thank you for this, Danny, by the way.  Chris Simon has been involved in numerous on-ice incidents and has been suspended eight times  for his conduct for a grand total of how many games?  Eight suspensions.  How many games?  Eight.  Eight?  This is not talking about, like, the majors he gets just in regular games where he has  to sit out, like, you know, ten minutes or the rest of a game. 
[00:16:30]  I have no idea.  This is like, okay, it was so bad, we have to suspend you future games.  So this has happened to him eight times.  How many games has he had to sit out?  Wow, let me think.  I'll say 24 games.  Can I hear the eight times he's got suspensions for what?  For fighting stuff?  Well, the on-ice incidents were so bad, they had to suspend him. 
[00:17:00]  Probably mostly fighting.  Okay.  Attempted murder.  So in the eight suspensions, how many total days were those?  Or games.  Games.  Games.  Games.  Were those suspensions?  16.  Try 65.  Wow.  Okay.  I used to love watching this guy.  Wow.  65.  That's almost a hockey season.  That's like, what, really quick, what, three quarters of a season?  That's nice.  Time all.  More? 
[00:17:30]  To relax.  Is that amazing?  And he's not in the NHL anymore.  We got false info.  He's actually in the Vityas Chekhov.  That's the name of the team?  Yeah.  He plays for the Vityas Chekhovs of the Continental, and they spell it with a K, Hockey League, over  there in Russia.  Yeah.  So he's not even in America anymore.  He's in Russia.  Yes.  And Booby Man from Brooklyn, before we move on, getting back to the Dallas game, Steelers  scored 17 points in the last seven minutes of that game to win, Jimmy. 
[00:18:00]  He's enraging.  Yeah.  And maybe, I don't know if we have time for it today, if we do, this is why the British  annoy me.  Oh.  They had a list of 100 of the greatest, of 100 living geniuses.  They're like, who's the great genius after Einstein?  And I read the list, and I wanted to put my face through a window.  Why?  It's because it's amazing how even in geniuses, they get politically correct.  Oh, no.  And they try to be hip, and it was just like, what are you doing? 
[00:18:30]  What name got you?  A bunch of them.  I mean...  Like what?  What?  Name one or two.  Well, who's...  Matt, what's his name?  Grennig?  Dylan?  No.  Oh, Grennig, the Simpsons creator?  Yeah.  Number four.  No!  On the list of living geniuses.  Where did Mr. Michio Kaku come in?  Not even on the list.  No!  It was done in England, though.  It was voted on...  But who cares?  It's all right.  No, voted on by British people.  Oh, okay.  Okay, they're stupid.  But, but, but, but, to show you how dumb they are. 
[00:19:00]  What's his, Matt, whatever?  It's number four?  Groaning.  Groaning?  Groaning, whatever.  Groaning.  I always said groaning.  Nelson Mandela's number five.  Yep.  Oh, wow.  A guy that's been...  What?  How many decades in jail?  27 years.  27 years in jail.  27 years in jail.  Couldn't even figure out how to saw his way out.  Couldn't beat out the cartoon guy.  Yeah, couldn't beat out...  Number seven.  Stephen Hawking.  The guy who theorized black holes in a wheelchair.  Right.  He doesn't beat out cartoon guy.  Cartoon guy.  Is number four.  Beats out Stephen Hawking. 
[00:19:30]  I love the Simpsons, too, but...  It's brilliant.  You don't put it in the genius category.  Or you don't put it in the top...  I wouldn't mind even being a living genius because he's a satirist and he's so good at getting  his point across without saying...  I mean...  Right.  Whatever.  If there's a top 100 geniuses, the top 70 should be nerds you've never heard of.  Exactly.  All scientists.  Yeah.  Well, the top three I've never heard of.  Albert Hoffman, a chemist.  Switzerland, yeah.  Tim Bemers-Lee, computer scientist. 
[00:20:00]  George Soros, investor and philanthropist.  Is that how you say that?  No, philanthropist.  Philan...  Yeah.  Really.  Philanthropic.  As soon as I said that, I knew I was wrong.  And then I couldn't even figure out the real...  Philip Glass.  Isn't he like a...  A composer?  George Glass.  Philip Glass.  What did he do?  Like TV themes?  His name is Philip Glass.  Yeah, you've heard of Philip Glass.  Yeah, but that's kind of...  He's in the credits all the time.  It's a hacky name, like, hey, this is Philip Glass. 
[00:20:30]  Philip Glass.  Philip Glass.  No, he's not here.  We could pull out the old...  Red.  Red tube tapes or whatever the hell they're called, so...  Where did I come in on the list?  You were 64th, which I didn't agree with.  I thought you should have been in the top 50.  Thank you, Jimmy.  And it bothered me.  Why do they have ties?  There's a bunch of ties on the list.  Because a bunch of dumb Brits voted.  Yeah, British people, you know...  They're so stupid. 
[00:21:00]  They think it makes them really culturally in tune to vote for Mandela.  I mean, Mandela's a great man, and I'm not saying you shouldn't vote him.  If you're the 100th greatest men, and you put him in the top five, I accept that.  Most important men, fine.  Geniuses?  Stephen Hawking is before Nelson Mandela?  Of course he is.  Sorry.  I'd have put Winnie Mandela figuring out how to take that tire full of gasoline, throw it around people's neck and ignite it.  I know.  Savage.  And having the same name as the Pooh, yet being frightening. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, Stephen Hawking has basically figured out, you know, where we came from, where we're going.  They've pretty much figured out the puzzle that is the universe.  Time to make you a Soweto necktie.  And Cartoon Guy beats him out.  Stupid.  Dolly Parton's on this place.  Yes, she is.  Dolly Parton.  Maybe physics.  She figured out how to walk without somersaulting all the time.  Enough with the big boobies, please. 
[00:22:00]  That's funny.  She's a wreck.  A Soweto necktie.  A Soweto necktie, Tigger.  Tigger's something else here.  I just don't hear about Soweto anymore.  That's not nearly enough.  I'm going to laugh about that all day.  Good old Soweto.  Hey, Adam, Long Island, what's up? 
[00:22:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Listen, last week, I never got to hear what the guest of sound was.  Oh, no.  Well, guess what?  Sucks to be you.  You've got to listen to the show longer.  We really went off on it.  Yeah.  It has something to do with one guy, one cup.  Good luck, guys.  One guy, one cup.  Good luck.  One guy, one cup.  Look it up on the internet.  All right.  Enjoy yourself.  So OJ got sentenced, I guess a bunch of the experts did the math, and he's got to do  at least nine years.  That's what it comes down to. 
[00:23:00]  I don't know.  Fifteen years?  I heard he has to do at least nine of it.  Eligible for parole in five, but...  No, not five anymore.  Nine to thirty years.  How is it nine?  Some have to run consecutively, not concurrently.  I heard it was all concurrent.  When she was dishing it out, it was like to run concurrent.  When she got into the later charges, and there were like 11 counts, 10, 11 counts, she  said, this will be consecutive.  This will be consecutive.  Oh, okay.  So it's annoying.  I thought I heard the entire sentencing, and I was like...  It was very confusing.  I didn't hear any consecutive. 
[00:23:30]  And I hear this is how they do it in the courtroom, but if you know you're going to be broadcasting  this for the layman's out there, all us dummies that are watching, just tell us.  How many years is OJ doing?  I'm not an expert.  I can't figure this out.  You're putting everybody out of work that comes on after for 10 hours and goes over every  second of it and tells you about it on the news.  Right, but just quickly, all right, for you dummies out there, because I know I got TVs  in my courtroom today, OJ has to do at least nine years.  She knew.  She did a whole dance around the sentencing, scolding him. 
[00:24:00]  It was like a courtroom show.  It was like Judge Judy.  She was auditioning for Hollywood.  Yeah, for a court program.  I don't know.  For the people that didn't watch, yeah, she spent, I don't know, easily 10 minutes kind  of...  At least, dude.  It was longer than that.  Just talking to OJ and what he did was just horrible and this and that.  And you think OJ's standing there listening to you, you dumb bitch.  He wants to know how many years he's doing in the joint.  He's not listening to a word you say. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  And none of these defendants listen to a word you say.  They just want to know, well, what is it going to be?  Am I walking out of this courtroom or am I going back to jail and how much time I'm doing?  They don't want to hear your personal little twist on the whole thing.  The sentence is already there.  She's just got to read it.  It's there.  No matter what his reaction is to her chastising him, isn't going to change it.  Like if he looks all solemn while she's yelling at him, that's going to change the sentence.  Then if he's like laughing at what she's saying, it's written down. 
[00:25:00]  It's already done.  She's made her mind up and that's what the sentence is going to be.  Right.  So just give the sentence out.  Don't play like big frigging, you're the one that's got to yell at OJ for the country.  Yeah, just shut up.  And what's Fred Goldman saying now?  He's going to try to take his five cents a day now or five cents an hour, whatever the  hell OJ is going to make?  For working in the prison library.  I work in the prison library.  That's what I do. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, I got here in, I believe it was Art 8.  That's when it was.  No, I never had no helpers before.  Well, let's get started.  Here's the Louis L'Amour.  Here's the Reader's Digest.  Here's a few of my books.  I really killed the bitch.  I load up the cart and I take it around.  Easy peasy Japanese.  Do you trust your wife? 
[00:26:00]  Throw a J off the roof.  The best about Fred Goldman talking to the press afterwards.  He called him a monster.  Yeah.  That's the clip I really want to play today.  We got the same.  Him he is.  He's this giant man that brutally murdered his son.  We got the sense sentencing.  It's just whatever hogwash.  It's long and boring.  So we don't.  OJ was here.  Put that on the beam before you hang yourself, dummy. 
[00:26:30]  You think he kills himself now?  Sometimes my hands hurt at the food waste.  Maybe I could kill Fred Goldman.  You know, sort of like a bonus.  I can't get enough of Shawshank.  I've watched that movie 8,000 times.  I'm going to watch it again.  It's been too long.  No, I don't think he kills himself.  I thought the same thing.  But as someone pointed out, his ego is too big. 
[00:27:00]  And then someone's like, no, he'll die in jail.  They'll never let him out.  The system has him now.  They'll never let him out.  He's in bad shape physically anyway.  Football really tore him up.  But I think what kept him going was a lot of these broads being out.  And even though he's a murderer, he wasn't convicted.  But he still has people that come up to him, ask for autographs.  They love OJ.  He was free, you know, breathing the fresh air.  Prison life for this guy? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  That could end it for him.  Look at him.  He just looks like a beaten man.  Look at the difference.  Oh, wow.  Going back in time.  And now he's just wearing, like, prison garb.  In the head of shackles.  Trying to argue his case.  He's in shackles.  People are saying that he's looking old.  That's the 60-year-old man.  He looks all right for 60.  Yeah, he doesn't look that bad.  60, 61 years old, right?  I haven't known that wrong.  No, he's probably right around 60, I would say.  Okay. 
[00:28:00]  61, maybe.  That's my guess anyway.  Sometimes I look for Al Cowlings.  But he never shows up.  Where is Al Cowlings?  I don't know.  Whatever happened to that guy?  He disappeared.  He goes, I want nothing to do with this guy.  He did what OJ should have done.  He laid low.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Lay low.  How do you not lay low?  I mean, most people are convinced he killed two people.  He did.  I'll say it.  He cut his wife's throat.  I believe it, too. 
[00:28:30]  Sure.  How do you not lay low after getting away with that?  Someone steals a couple of footballs you signed, you let it go.  You know what I mean?  If karma and there's payback and it's annoying, you don't walk in with a gun, what are you going  to do?  Yeah.  I think the only way you do something with a gun is if somebody hurt one of his kids.  Right.  That's the only thing I could think of.  Besides that, lay the F low.  Yep.  You got away with one.  You totally got away with it. 
[00:29:00]  Fred Goldman, though, I want to hear the clip where he calls him a monster, that they finally  got the monster and he's going to be behind the floor.  The monster.  Kong.  Ladies and gentlemen, Kong.  That's what they should do, just chain him up in some big swanky hall.  Don't take his picture.  You'll upset him.  Why do handlebar mustache guys think they look good?  I just want to throw that out there.  It is the worst look on the face.  Fred still got one of those? 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  He doesn't go all out, but he's got the little wax on the ends of it.  Mustache.  Mustache wax.  Do these guys think they look good out there?  What are they doing?  You know what it is?  Fred Goldman has no skin on his palate below his nose.  If you take the mustache off, it's all just gums and bones.  There's nothing.  It's actually taped on.  Police up that mustache.  Imagine having to go there to go to a store and say, excuse me, do you have some mustache 
[00:30:00]  wax?  I need mustache wax.  You don't even see that by the register as one of those impulse buys by the Tic Tacs and  gum.  Because no one uses it.  No.  Fred Goldman does.  What do you get it?  You dig in your ear?  Oh, that's a good idea.  That's a great idea.  Put it to use.  You go to the store, it's behind the Edsel paint.  Here's Fred Goldman after the OJ verdict. 
[00:30:30]  There's never closure.  Ron is always gone.  And what we have is satisfaction that this monster is where he belongs behind bars.  He did a crime, he did it with guns, and he's going to be where he belongs with others  of his kind, and he can complain there.  The monster.  There you go. 
[00:31:00]  I didn't know that.  I did not realize either.  Is this true?  Does Sam, our own Sam.  Yeah, when I was saying it, I felt bad.  His dad has a handlebar mustache.  Let me see.  Holy Toledo.  Sam Goldman.  He actually looks a lot more like that movie reviewer guy.  Let me see.  Shallot?  Yeah, yeah.  Gene Shallot, or one of those things with the glasses.  How long has your pops had the handle?  Here, give that to O.  Not only does your dad look like Fred Goldman, I hope he has to grieve the same tragedy. 
[00:31:30]  Wait, so your mom's black.  No.  Yeah, because your father is as white as he comes.  So, your mom's black, huh?  No, my mom's white too.  Good for your dad, man.  Yeah, huh?  Get a little chocolate.  My dad's had that mustache for at least 35 years.  Yeah, that's one of those mustaches you know someone's had forever.  Because you don't just decide to have a mustache that the weightlifter in the 1800s circus had.  You know? 
[00:32:00]  No, it's been 40 years.  My parents have been married for 40 years.  And it's in his wedding picture?  It's in his wedding picture.  What did he do when he was younger?  Was he a model for the Monopoly cards?  Do you think it looks silly?  I think it would look more silly if he didn't have it, just because it's always been there.  But when compared to other people.  Does he get the wax and stuff?  Yeah.  Well, he doesn't do it anymore, because it's just stuck like that anyway.  But yeah, he has it in his bathroom.  He used to use it when I was younger.  And does it say mustache wax on it? 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, he's got a little can of mustache wax.  Mustache.  And how old is it?  The can.  It's old, but everything he has.  He doesn't sell it anymore.  That stock's got to be dropping.  Oh, it's awful.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm getting stock in mustache wax.  I really think that's going to bring us out of our recession.  I think they made 10 canisters.  Yeah, they were all residing in somebody's.  They just share it.  Medicine cabinet.  He also doesn't use, like, shaving cream.  He uses, like, it's in a mug.  No, he doesn't have the little soap. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  There's like a soap tablet, almost.  It goes in the mug, and you go, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink.  He shaves like he's in the Old West.  Yeah.  Yeah, he uses a brush.  Oh, God.  Does he lay in a big tub, and your mom comes in and pours hot water in on it?  I got to add.  Six guns are up on the sink.  What the hell?  What's going on in your house, Sam?  I got to ask Jimmy.  You think Sam's dad likes shaving?  Um, no.  You think he enjoys it?  No?  No.  I don't think so. 
[00:33:30]  No.  Hmm.  Loves it!  Wow!  Does he?  All right.  How much does he make of the carnival barker?  Step right up.  And he's got, he must have one of those razors that you twist the bottom, and it like opens  like a Venus fly trap, and then he drops in.  Oh, my God.  Because that's what it's old school is, the clink, clink, clink, clink. 
[00:34:00]  Does he have like the blue fluid and stuff?  Work up a good lather.  Keep his mustache comb nice and sanitized?  He must.  I've never seen it, but he's got to, because he's got a mustache comb.  Or even better, screw the old razor I was just talking about.  A straight razor that he slaps on a leather strap that hangs from the side of the sink  or something.  Do you hear that?  Is there a comb in blue fluid next to the sink?  No.  He doesn't own a barbershop.  No.  It sounds like the old barbershop. 
[00:34:30]  Is he in a barbershop quartet?  No.  He's a mustache comb?  Oh, he's got a few mustache combes.  A few?  Yeah.  You should get a new one called the Desert Eagle.  Nice.  Nice.  But yeah, it's a good look.  The handlebar mustache is kind of coming back.  That's good.  I'm sure he's a nice guy, but come on.  Along with scurvy and slavery, it's not coming back.  It's an awful look, Sam. 
[00:35:00]  That is Sweeney Todd.  Thank you, Palzak.  Nice.  Good line.  Very good.  All right.  Handlebar mustache.  They just call it that, because that's what the guy standing in front of you holds on  to.  Oh, poor Sam.  I don't know.  Who knew his father had a ridiculous mustache?  Exactly.  Is he depressed since retiring from the Oakland A's? 
[00:35:30]  Wow.  He's a respectable gentleman.  I'm certain he is.  After so many years with the same mustache, he shows dedication.  I apologize ahead of time, but how does your mom, like, have sex with her?  Okay.  I don't think she does.  Oh, God.  Now you get right into that.  I thought you were just going to start kissing and then go on the fact that she's got to  wash wax off of certain areas.  How does she have sex?  Okay.  Yes?  I was going to say, perhaps that's the wax that he's using. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, now it's getting really bad.  What were you going to say, Jimmy?  Oh, I just, how does she have sex with him?  I was going to speculate that that waxed mustache gets put into the pillow and a very special  belt gets put on.  That was just a speculation.  Just saying.  Sorry.  In the winter, what do you, he sleeps in, like, one of those man nightgowns.  No.  No, he doesn't.  Like Fred Mertz would come out and, hey, what's all the racket? 
[00:36:30]  Then he'd come out.  Time to get some sleep here, Rick.  Is your dad a time traveler?  Yeah.  What the hell is he?  Wow.  He doesn't belong in this century.  Oh, he's going to be really happy.  Has he written Christmas carols?  Yeah.  Does he go down for a snack with a little candle in the little holder with his finger in there  holding it?  Mm, just looking for a little snack in the ice box.  Hey, that's it.  He's Ebeneezer Scrooge. 
[00:37:00]  You're kidding.  He wears the man nightgown?  Is it called a man nightgown or is it your mommy's nightgown?  No, it's a man nightgown.  The side of it.  But it's a nightgown.  It's not pants.  It's like a long shirt thing that goes down to, like, your ankles.  There's no pants involved.  Is it striped?  No, he's got a couple of different ones.  And does he wear the hat with it?  No hat.  Like the hat, the pointy, kind of Santa-looking hat.  The stocking cap, it's called.  The stocking cap.  Does your dad's ball bag slip out every once in a while when he's wearing his neck? 
[00:37:30]  It's a man nightgown.  You can see that.  It's a long nightgown.  And slippers.  Did someone say this?  Does he have the hat that goes along with it?  Yeah, yeah.  He did say it.  He just said it.  Yeah.  He doesn't have the hat.  No.  All right.  Well, yeah, because that would be ridiculous.  Well, who wears a sleeping cap?  A sleeping cap.  Who the hell does everything you just described that your father does?  Does he go to work on one of those bicycles with a huge front wheel and a little back wheel?  You're the son of a 1920s baseball card. 
[00:38:00]  Basically, what we're saying is your dad sucks.  We hate him.  We've never even met him, but we hate him.  He just bothers us.  I'd rather have my dad, and he's dead.  That's right.  Get him to autograph some big lead shoe for us.  Beat it.  Beat it, stupid.  Oh, God.  Damn, Sam.  That is something. 
[00:38:30]  He's like a real blast from the past.  Yeah, well, he likes you guys.  Yeah.  Yeah, does he?  He did.  Apparently.  If he likes us, shave your stupid mustache.  No one wears that anymore.  Actually, go up a few years.  Just snip the edges off and leave the middle part right under the nose.  I got to ask one more question, and I really don't know the answer to this, but has he  ever gone to a mustache convention?  No.  No, not that I know of.  All right.  Because I hear they have those.  These guys are hardcore.  Yeah.  No, he's not, like, in the mustache community. 
[00:39:00]  He might be in another community.  Oh, exactly.  That Al Pacino tried to infiltrate in a 1980 film.  Yeah.  Ex-nay on the secret community.  Yeah.  He just grooms his mustache.  Yeah.  No, the whole thing, the shaving thing, the man nightgown, it's the whole picture there  just is fantastic.  Yeah.  I can just picture him going to bed, like, stretching his arms out.  And then some placard with words comes on it. 
[00:39:30]  He doesn't talk.  There's some player piano playing, like, honky-tonk music as he goes to bed.  And the words, I'm sleepy, my son's a failure.  Pop up.  Just walking around to player piano music, holding up plaques with words on it.  His house, your house isn't even a talkie.  You have a silent house.  I never saw this movie, but I do believe this line will get a laugh. 
[00:40:00]  His dad is Bill the Butcher from Gangs of New York.  Oh, very good.  Yeah.  I had confidence in that, even though I never saw the movie.  Oh, that's a good one.  Yeah, that's a good one.  He's just Sam's house.  There's a music that plays when he comes home from work.  My word, I'm hungry.  Got to go down to the ice chest.  Has the ice man been here?  The milkman come to your house?  No, we buy milk at the stocking shop.  At Zooks.  He's coming over on a ship, looking at the Statue of Liberty, making those big eyes. 
[00:40:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Looking at his pocket watch.  Trying to avoid the guy that walks around to see who has got a ticket.  Because he stowed away.  Everything.  Everything in Sam's house is moving just slightly too fast.  Oh, I was just about to say that.  Except Sam's career.  Oh!  Did he put in light bulbs that flicker on purpose just to have that look?  Sam's house!  My house is a donkey. 
[00:41:00]  Were you afraid to bring girls home because you tied them in the train tracks?  Is this your dad's favorite line?  Nyah, nyah, nyah.  He's no villain.  Oh, he isn't?  No.  Oh, okay.  He's one of the good guys then.  Yeah.  That's very nice.  Yeah, wonderful, Sam.  Learned something new today.  He just thinks things were simpler back then.  That's good.  How's your wife?  Uh, wife.  How's your mom, Mary Pickford?  America's Sweetheart. 
[00:41:30]  Wife.  Crazy.  Dummy.  Pretty impressive.  I think it's break time.  Pretty impressive for someone that lives his life old school to marry a black woman.  No, my mom's white.  What?  My mom is white.  Someone in your family is black.  Not that I've met.  Let me see a picture of your mom.  Okay.  I want to see his name, too.  Are you adopted?  No.  Is it in an old locket, the picture?  It's because you have an iPhone.  It's funny.  On a ship. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Old black and white footage.  Dude, it doesn't make sense.  They had you.  Yes.  I've seen baby pictures.  Is that your mom?  Let me see your mom.  His parents are as white as they could get, but Sam has major black features.  Major.  But he's very white.  Right.  Yeah.  With light skin.  Wow.  How the hell did they have a kid that looks kind of black?  I don't know.  It just happens sometimes.  That is weird.  Such a mom picture.  All right.  Naked pictures of his chick. 
[00:42:30]  What?  Yeah.  No.  Just look at the one picture.  No.  I'm scrolling through.  Oh.  Your girlfriend's cute.  Wow.  Now it's getting uncomfortable.  Oh, it's Danny.  What?  Why is Danny in there?  Some cute.  And then concert pictures from a mile away.  You just have awful pictures on your phone.  Oh, I can't take this away.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  Yeah, that's Sam's dad going swimming in the striped bathing suit. 
[00:43:00]  The one piece.  The big one piece suit.  That had buttons for whatever reason.  Look at this huge.  I know.  I know.  Look at that guy.  It's amazing.  Everyone looks good in that freaking.  The stripes really accentuated because you can really see depth.  All right.  Opian Anthony, 877-212-0&A.  Quick break.  Good morning to everybody.  It's the Opian Anthony Show.  Just a quick one on gas.  Driving home from Philly yesterday. 
[00:43:30]  Hit one.  You got one?  I had a lot of chili yesterday.  I'm waiting for that to start working its way through the body.  That's not good.  I thought I'd have a treat for everybody this morning, but so far, no dice.  You know, it's not a treat.  It's a treat when Jimmy does it, though, right?  No.  We still got to do Raisin Bran Monday.  Yeah, we were going to do that, right?  We could do any day this week.  But anyway, driving home from Philly, needed gas. 
[00:44:00]  I was about at a quarter, pull over, and I hand the guy 50 bucks.  I'm like, here, fill her up.  Thinking, whatever $50 does, it'll get me to New York.  He fills up the car and hands me back $25.  Damn.  And I went, what?  He goes, yeah, gas is cheap again.  $1.78 I paid last night.  Nice.  He goes, this is happening all the time because everyone is used to just handing over, here,  here's 50, here's 100. 
[00:44:30]  And you forgot that the gas prices have dropped drastically in the last month or so.  Yeah.  That was a nice little treat to get money back for once.  So I gave him a nice little tip because it was a little cold out.  You did.  Got to tip these people.  I don't tip.  You don't tip the gas guy?  Rarely.  Yeah, give him a buck.  If every car gave those guys a buck, they'd do all right, especially with the gas that cheap.  Yeah, tip him.  If he shoots it in his mouth and spits it in the tank, I'll give him a tip of his show. 
[00:45:00]  It's like he's filling up my gas tank.  That's his job.  Yeah, but my logic.  Like a waitress or anything like that.  If they clean the windshield, I'll tip him.  Do you understand anything about the economy?  Yeah.  Like, if these guys stop pumping your gas, they're going to be knocking you over the head and robbing you.  I figure you throw them a buck or two extra that maybe one poor soul out there doesn't get a brick to the back of the head.  Yeah.  Man, that's how I look at it.  Some of these guys are working the fast food joints that are serving you food. 
[00:45:30]  Trust me, the economy goes down a little more.  They're the same people that are going to be robbing you on the streets.  Pulling you into some back alley and doing stuff with your hiney.  They're out in 10 degree weather pumping gas.  I thanked them by throwing some soda on them.  Here you go.  Hey, you're going to take that with you.  Exactly.  Ice cubes.  What an awful thing to do.  Get them all wet.  I was with my friend Looch and a couple of my other friends back when we were teenagers.  It was like weather like we have now.  It was probably five degrees out.  It was like one night. 
[00:46:00]  We had this giant canist.  It was like a giant oxygen tube filled.  We were shooting frozen water, like ice water.  And we were trying to find people walking in the freezing cold to shoot ice water on.  It was terrible.  It was like a fire extinguisher, but much bigger.  Yeah.  And I don't know what it was.  But we finally got like three homies walking down the street.  And we shot at them.  And they chased the car.  And we drove away.  Of course they did.  But there was nobody on the streets.  It was so cold.  Killed you?  Yeah.  Wow.  And then they had to walk home wet and cold. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Oh.  It wasn't cold.  It was freezing cold.  You did jackass before jackass.  Yeah.  We were idiots.  I think a lot of people did actually.  They figured out how to capitalize on it.  It is ridiculous cold.  The rest of us are just stupid.  Not filming our stuff.  It is cold today here in New York.  It was cold.  I can't keep my vehicle in the garage because other things are taking up my garage right now.  So I got it outside.  And I figure I'm going to use that handy dandy item that is built into my vehicle where from in my house I could start my car up. 
[00:47:00]  Again, I leave everything like blazing, the heat and everything.  I hear.  And I'm in my dining room cursing at my car.  You piece of goddamn.  I can't take this.  Because I got to walk out into a cold vehicle.  Right.  I'm much too fancy for that. 
[00:47:30]  But why wouldn't it start up?  I don't know.  I got to take it back.  Oh, so you brought another car in?  No, no.  You were able to figure it out?  No, I went outside and started it with my key.  What?  And then ran back inside.  But that thing.  Oh, the thing didn't work.  Yeah, my key fob.  I got you.  My key fob is supposed to.  If you lock the doors, you give it the old meh until you hear the horn beep.  And then you hit the little arrow thing.  It starts your vehicle with the doors locked. 
[00:48:00]  And then you're able to let it heat up.  And you get into a toasty, warm vehicle.  I finally realized I have to get a new car.  And you've had the same car for quite some time.  I got the car I'm driving right around, right before 9-11.  I just don't understand what it means to have money, I guess.  I'm a dope.  But I've been driving my car where the heat doesn't work on the passenger side at all. 
[00:48:30]  So you as the driver, you can be nice and toasty, warm.  And whoever your passenger is, which 99.9% of the time is my chick, right?  And she's been complaining, like, look, there's no heat in the passenger side.  And I'm like, yeah, yeah, because I'm nice and toasty.  So I don't really understand the concept.  So we're not in a big room here.  Let me just.  Do you try to, like, with your arms, move some air, the warm air around you over there to her side? 
[00:49:00]  I moved my vent over toward her.  Figured, ah, that's got to take care of the problem.  Do a quick, like, 180, like a stuntman 180 on the road.  And then the air inside the car will stay where it is.  And she'll have the warm air.  Would that work?  So, and this happened all last winter, too.  And she would be in the passenger seat all bundled up.  And I'm like, wow, man, it's hot in here.  I'm taking my coat off while we're driving.  And she's, like, she's got her hat on, her gloves.  I'm like, it can't be that bad, right?  And I hate to be the passenger in anyone's car.  But last night I was really tired. 
[00:49:30]  I'm like, you're going to have to drive home.  I'm just, I don't think I can make it.  So she was driving.  And you know, it was, what, like 20 degrees last night?  So I'm in the passenger seat.  By the time I got home, I couldn't feel my toes.  And this is what she has to go through all the time.  That's what I'm getting at.  Oh, you are a bastard.  She's like, and she was playing my part.  She's like, oh, my God, I'm really hot, really toasty.  So she leans forward, and I take her coat off.  Next thing you know, I'm wearing, like, her coat around, like, my legs to try to keep them warm. 
[00:50:00]  My toes are freezing.  I got gloves.  I had a hoodie on.  Was your vehicle 100 feet wide?  I don't know.  So I'm like, you're right next to each other.  Afton Stern.  What's the matter with you?  So I'm like, we've got to get a new car.  She's like, I've been telling you this for a year, how cold it is in the passenger seat.  So what are you going to get?  I'm going to Major World.  Are they still, I don't even care if they're, are they a sponsor?  I don't think, yeah, they are.  All right.  Major World, you're getting a call from me today, because I need a car. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  I don't feel like getting cold anymore.  Yeah, you could really go in, you could get something pretty damn inexpensive these days.  Boy, they are literally trying to just get rid of these cars, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's pretty easy.  I'm buying something, hopefully, not today.  I'm too tired, but maybe tomorrow.  I think it's a good time to lease, because I have my leases up, my lease from my closet.  Dude, lease.  Get freaking out of check.  Why?  They're giving these things away.  It's like, why would I, a Cadillac, right?  Although I hear leasing is starting to be good again. 
[00:51:00]  It's a hard-pissed write-off.  For a while, it wasn't good, though.  It's good.  Yeah, what do I want to buy it for?  It's three years, 10,000 miles, I bring it back.  I bought my Mustang.  That's the only thing I bought, because I plan on keeping it.  But any other vehicle, lease it, bring it back.  I'm old school.  I buy a car and run it into the ground.  That's what I do.  I run it into the ground.  I haven't washed my car in I don't know how long.  It's terrible.  I take meticulous care of my leased vehicles up until probably the last year. 
[00:51:30]  And then it starts the slow decline down to, well, I'm almost ready to turn this piece  of crap in.  Yeah, no, I lease because first time I released, because I don't do enough miles to make it  like a problem, you know, in the city.  And it's like, I took 15,000 miles a year just to be cautious because I'm a sissy.  I've done 10,000 miles in three years.  Drive somewhere.  You're hurting my feelings.  Drive somewhere is right.  Just driving in circles around Chelsea.  Absolutely.  It doesn't really chalk up the mileage, does it?  I know. 
[00:52:00]  Very true.  They all tend to stand on the same five blocks.  But how many times have you had to replace the driver's side window?  That motor that makes it go up and down?  And I keep having to have like...  More miles on that than your motor.  And there's a dent midway on the passenger door from certain people leaning in to talk.  Yeah, just certain damage that only Jimmy's car gets.  Yeah.  The upholstery.  If you're leasing, you should have a lot more miles than that, Jimmy. 
[00:52:30]  You should beat the crap out of that thing.  No, I want to lease something with Sirius in it this time.  Because last time, I was kind of limited.  Like, I couldn't lease a BMW.  I never drove a car like that.  I would like to try it.  I did think about the radio in my vehicle before I leased it.  I did want an Escalade.  But, and, you know, it was just luck that it had XM in it.  But when I bought the Mustang, I was like, oh, it's got Sirius. 
[00:53:00]  Because I was kind of like, eh, I'd rather have XM in there.  I was happy that I had Sirius in there.  But it would affect my car buying.  Right.  You know?  I don't know.  Because I like the big SUVs because they're just...  You could do anything with them on the road.  And the winter, it's so much easier.  No shovel in the driveway.  You put that beast in reverse and just go.  Even if I didn't have money, I would be in an SUV. 
[00:53:30]  You got it.  I just love SUVs.  I can't stand driving in the snow in a car.  Right.  We're not going to get a lot of snow this year.  You don't think so?  That's going to be a bad one.  Hey, let's move on.  So what's up with Obama?  He's a smoker.  He's not a smoker.  He won.  What's with Obama?  He's in it.  I'll tell you.  And don't be fooled.  He's officially the president.  I know they make it official in, what, 43 days?  I think Bush has 43 days left.  Well, he's not fessing up to it.  What? 
[00:54:00]  He's the president.  He's the president.  He's pretty much just keeping mum on a lot of things that he, even the Democrats kind  of been getting on him like, hey, you got to be a little more vocal about some of the  things that are going on, especially with the economy.  He's kind of been just tight-lipped about it.  He's hoping that thing turns around in 43 days.  That's why he's tight-lipped.  He doesn't want anything to do with this.  So he said, you know, this country, there's one president at a time, so I'm just waiting  for my turn.  But it's like, you know, it's a few days, you know, or a month or something. 
[00:54:30]  43.  43?  Yeah, they got the count down in the paper.  When the hell is it?  January what?  20th.  20th?  Oh, it is later in January.  Could it be that he doesn't want to tip his hand, though, because he doesn't want Bush,  for partisan reasons, doing anything that might affect something he's going to do?  Yeah.  Like, that's strategic, I think?  Yeah, might be.  Might be.  Yeah, he's just getting his staff together, whatever.  What does Bush at this point want to even lower popularity?  Let me undermine the incoming president.  Well, what did unemployment tell us last week? 
[00:55:00]  550,000 people lost their jobs.  A lot of people were out of work.  In the last month, was it?  550,000 more people lost their job last month?  Most.  The most since 1974, and we're up to 6.7 unemployment, which is still low, but we know there's more  coming.  Is that low?  Yeah.  Compared to the rest of the world.  You know what, though?  Yeah, it is.  You know, when you think of it relative to how many people are working, it's like, wow,  we've got a lot of people working.  How high do you think that'll go before we turn things around, do you think? 
[00:55:30]  98% unemployed, I'd say.  They're saying it might get as high as 9, 10%, which is pretty bad.  That's huge.  No way.  You don't think so?  No, that's crazy.  That's crazy talk.  Look, we better do something before it gets to that point.  Well, what we got on Obama today is this smoking thing.  Yeah, Obama.  It kind of, they were dogging him a little bit about it during the election, during his  campaigning and stuff.  The guy likes an occasional cigarette, and apparently it's more than just occasional. 
[00:56:00]  He's always played it off like he just likes a little, you know, puff here and there, one  cigarette and stuff.  But the truth of the matter is, this guy's smoking a lot more than he's fessing up to,  which, you know, you smoke, you smoke.  But even that, he can't be completely honest about, you know?  Finally, Mr. President-elect.  Oh, that's right.  Tom Brokaw.  Tom Brokaw.  I forgot about our hair.  Mr. President-elect.  Hello, President-elect. 
[00:56:30]  Let's hear him a little more.  Finally, Mr. President-elect, the White House is a no-smoking zone.  And when you were asked about this recently by Barbara Walters, I read it very carefully,  you ducked.  Have you stopped smoking?  You know, I have, but what I said was that, you know, there are times where I've fallen  off the wagon.  Well, wait a minute.  That means you haven't stopped.  Well, fair enough.  What I would say is that I have done a terrific job under the circumstances of making myself 
[00:57:00]  much healthier, and I think that you will not see any violations of these rules in the  White House.  Wow.  Instead of smoking two packs a day, he's probably smoking one.  That's what that is.  To me.  He is still smoking.  That's ridiculous.  Why can't you?  Why can't you?  Just answer the goddamn question.  But they're all the same.  You know something?  All these politicians.  Do you smoke or not?  Simple as that.  Smoking, it's a bad habit, but I do it.  I'm going to try my best not to, but, you know, it's tough. 
[00:57:30]  You know, I was listening to an ad for a movie this morning, and it said rated PG for light  sexual content, light violence, and short scenes of smoking.  What?  That was one of the things they added in.  That's part of the rating system now?  That's part of why it's rated PG.  Like, because there's people smoking in it.  People smoke! 
[00:58:00]  If you want a character in a movie that is a certain way, that has a certain personality,  that they smoke.  Because certain people do smoke.  That's part of the rating system now?  Yeah, it's part of why a movie is rated PG.  Because they don't want, like, little, you know.  Ugh.  I hate this country.  It's not like, you know.  I hate the nerds that are running this country.  It's not like Disney movies are out there, and, you know, the character's smoking. 
[00:58:30]  But it's just part of life.  You don't think kids walk around on the sidewalks and see people smoking cigarettes?  Maybe ask questions?  My God, perished the thought they asked a question of their parent.  Hey, what's that?  What are they doing?  Isn't that supposed to be bad for you?  And then you sit them down and say, shut up.  You're stupid.  You're a kid.  Or something like that.  I don't know how you're a parent.  A little, you know.  Oh, wow. 
[00:59:00]  Give them candy cigarettes like I had when I was a kid.  That's what you do.  Candy cigarettes.  Exactly.  You turned out fine.  Sure.  Well, okay.  I'm not a shining example.  Almighty.  I don't think it was a candy cigarette.  You're the poster board for ones too many, a thousand's not enough.  I like that.  Too good.  Yeah, so I guess, who put that in there? 
[00:59:30]  Clinton?  Was that 1992?  I think it was 92, Hillary Clinton said, that's it, no smoking in the White House.  And Bill, she used to send Bill out on the balcony to smoke his cigars.  I guess he showed her.  Yeah, well, we're going to have a cigar here in the Oval Office.  That's right.  I won't light it.  You don't like the smell of smoke? How about the smell of this?  That's right.  A bacala. 
[01:00:00]  That's right.  Got to keep that cigar moist, though.  Yes, you do. It was a humidor.  That's right.  But, yeah, she enacted that in, like, 92, and ever since then, it's been some politically incorrect thing to smoke in the White House.  So, him being a smoker, who knows?  It's one of those things.  If you're the president of the United States, in Washington, D.C., it gets cold.  You think it's going to be this frigid, freezing cold day, and he's going to be like, well, Hillary said, it's like, it's my house now, bitch. 
[01:00:30]  My house.  And just smoke wherever the hell he wants.  Lincoln bedroom.  Smoke up.  That's what I would do if I was president.  It's my house now for however long I'm here.  Live it up.  Can he make it into a smoking White House?  I would turn, if I was him, I'd turn it into Scatman Crothers' room.  Those big Afro paintings on either wall.  Big gnarly toes poking out of his blanket. 
[01:01:00]  Just the fact that as a country, we're even discussing, does he smoke?  It's like, we're just little babies.  We're like little children.  Yeah, very gossipy.  We're hall monitors.  Yeah.  Country of little tattletales and snitches and hall monitors.  It's silly.  I'm a fan of the smoker.  I think there's too many people on this earth.  Yeah.  You need some of these things happening.  It does.  Nothing to hurt somehow.  It does kill people. 
[01:01:30]  All right.  All right.  So that was a lot.  You know, the economy falling apart and most people don't know if they're going to have  a job by Monday and that's what they're discussing in the news.  Make sure he doesn't smoke in the White House.  Yeah, of course.  Why do they have the inauguration in like late January?  It looks like a miserable time.  Every time they do the inauguration for the new president.  Why can't they like somehow figure out, all right, you know what?  It sucks down here in Washington in January.  Let's just do it in April or May when spring hits.  Do you know in ye olde days how hard it was to put something together from, like, they 
[01:02:00]  probably started from the time the election was done in November till January where the  inauguration, like, everyone the day after the election went, okay, get in the wagons,  we're going to the inauguration, and it just took them two months to get there.  That's probably where this comes from.  Yeah, it's probably why, but it's-  It took two months for the whole country to find out who the next president was.  Yeah.  And then to get the covered wagons into Washington to- 
[01:02:30]  We're going east.  Yeah, we're heading east.  I mean, but it's 2008.  You can have it the next day.  You elect a new president.  The one that's in there is the lame duck, and that's not good for us, the citizens of  this country.  So you should be elected.  Week off, go to the Bahamas, have a nice little vacation, come back and get your ass in there  and start working.  I guess you've got to pick all your peeps, too.  That's a little, you know.  All right, give it a couple weeks.  A couple weeks. 
[01:03:00]  You've got to move.  Yeah, move.  But this is like radio.  How about like radio where you just, you know, sorry, you've got to move.  Two and a half months, though?  That's ridiculous.  Why not do it like the Super Bowl and move it to a different city every year?  You know, move it somewhere warm.  That's not a bad idea.  Where they can have a cool party.  Covered stadium.  Yeah.  That's actually not a bad idea.  But you see those guys miserable, freezing their asses off.  Got to find a private school for your kids, because it's D.C.  He's putting those kids in private schools like all the presidents do. 
[01:03:30]  Isn't that hysterical?  It's like they talk and talk and talk about educating this in schools.  And the city they live in is so bad, not one of them wants to send their kids to the public school system there.  Nice.  It speaks volumes.  Start with the White House itself.  It's in a horrendous area.  Yeah.  The park across the street is just awful.  I don't think it was always like that.  It's kind of hard to move those monuments elsewhere to Utah.  You know?  The neighborhood kind of went bad. 
[01:04:00]  They didn't look around and say, hey, this looks great.  You know?  At the time, it was like, I could have you shot for that.  They don't even know what half the statues mean, because some homeless guy took his you-know-what  and rubbed it all over the statue and the nameplate.  Wonderful.  Got to bring a rag around to wipe it off so you know what you're looking at.  It is just horrible.  All these beautiful monuments.  Homeless people everywhere.  Homeless people and thugs.  All right.  Quick break. 
[01:04:30]  John Lennon died today, huh?  How many years ago?  Oh.  1980, right?  I was going to say.  Wow.  You are behind the times.  28 years ago today.  Was it?  28 years ago.  28 years ago.  That doesn't make you feel old today, huh?  And Kim Basinger.  Remember that?  Hot piece of ass who went nutso.  Yeah.  She's got all sorts of issues.  She's 55 today.  55 years old.  She was in, what was the movie?  10? 
[01:05:00]  Not 10.  That was Bo Dirk.  No, I know that.  But I mean, the freaking with Mickey Rourke.  Not nine and a half weeks.  No, that was.  Was she nine and a half weeks?  Angel Heart.  No.  Look at that.  Rumblefish.  Was she in nine and a half weeks?  I have no idea what she was in.  She was in nine and a half weeks.  Oh, was she?  Am I losing my mind?  You're probably right.  Okay.  Yeah, she was.  All right.  I got scared there.  I got mixed up with Angel Heart.  You know, the famous food scene, which everyone thinks is sexy.  The sexiest scene in a movie has to be nine and a half weeks. 
[01:05:30]  When they're in front of the refrigerator feeding each other in such a sensual manner.  Shut up.  Food and sex.  Ugh.  Doesn't go together.  Sucks every time, right?  I don't like, like, you ever, maybe you had a cookie in bed one night or something like  that, and then you're rolling around with your chick, and you have your hand going down  a nice smooth back, and you feel a cookie crumb on her ass.  Food and sex.  No.  I, uh.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:06:00]  I knew nothing of razors back then.  Oh, my God.  She was all right, though, huh?  It was breast.  I.  She was I.  Nice pointy nips.  Wow.  What's that from?  Playboy?  She did Playboy?  Everyone ends up doing Playboy.  Wow.  What year is that?  Because, boy, a razor had not seen that segment.  Well, she's 55 today.  That's got to be before she's 30.  I'm going to go with, I bet you she's 28 in that pictorial.  There's one there with her hair that looks like Jeff Conaway in that first picture.  Where?  What hair? 
[01:06:30]  She was eight.  Yeah, not bad, not bad.  She went nutso, though, huh?  Yeah.  All right, we'll talk about food and sex next.  I have a little story from the college days, how ridiculous that food and sex thing is.  Chocolate-covered banana?  Terrible.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Got a lot of wise asses checking in. 
[01:07:00]  Opie, we already heard your story from college about sex and food.  The marshmallow story.  No, that's not what I'm talking about, you ass.  You asses, because that's coming in a lot.  Phone number 877-212-O-N-A.  I don't feel like telling that story.  Too sexy.  You know what I told my wife?  During the honeymoon? 
[01:07:30]  This is why I love this girl.  Don't worry, I'm not going to get too sappy.  Too late.  I actually wrote you to back me up, and you didn't write me back.  What happened?  I texted you.  Oh, during vacation?  Yeah.  I was inebriated.  I understand.  Actually, I wasn't, unfortunately.  Oh, I was on drugs, right.  This is what I do on my honeymoon.  So, I spent an hour at the bar telling my girl how I lost my virginity. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, that's good.  But it was with the girl.  Do you remember?  I think.  It used to be a classic bit we used to do.  And I needed you to back me up, because she was losing her mind laughing so hard.  And I'm like, look, Ant will back me up.  Yeah, well, no, I wasn't there.  Someone's asking if I was there, but no.  I remember hearing the story, though.  Your memory can't be this shot.  It is pretty bad.  We've done this bit ten times easily.  Yeah, they all just kind of meld together after a while. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, my God.  No, because there's other stories.  There's a hairy back girl.  That's the one.  Okay, all right.  All right, good.  You were scaring me.  No, because that's the one I lost my virginity to.  I was confused with hand out the window, girl.  Oh.  See, that confused me.  Oof.  So that, I didn't know which was which.  That almost wrecked it.  And then there was the girl, leave the message, phone message girl.  Oh, that's the buffalo slut.  There's a couple of stories that I could confuse for the virginity story, but that was her. 
[01:09:00]  It was horse main girl.  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you.  I had my girl laughing her ass off.  At me.  She wasn't laughing with me.  She was laughing at me.  Yeah.  Like, pretty much, she might as well have just pointed and laughed.  Yeah.  I figured I'd share.  You, uh...  Well, the girl I lost my virginity to at Geneseo, I was a late bloomer, yes.  I didn't, uh, I wasn't one of those lucky guys in high school. 
[01:09:30]  Mm-hmm.  No sex till college.  Damn.  Did you get anything in high school?  Nope.  Wow.  Well, yeah, but not, I was, I was small for my age.  Who cares?  Find a small girl.  I was a late bloomer.  Go to it.  How small were you?  I mean, I was 5'2", 91 pounds in 10th grade.  That's how small I was.  But I mean, did you get any...  And now I'm like right around 6 foot.  Do you get any Hummers or anything?  No.  I was a late bloomer.  No sexual contact.  I mean, the making out, the, you know, trying to get patched, that type of thing.  Heavy, heavy petting. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  All that stuff.  Just so, frustration.  Mm-hmm.  That's what you had, frustration.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  That is a bitch, man.  Yeah.  And then I was 5'6", in 11th grade.  And then finally, I made it to like 5'9", when I graduated.  And then I grew when I was in college.  You sprouted.  I was a late sprouter.  No.  Yeah.  I was a frustrated high schooler for the most part.  People are writing lots of jacking.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Lots.  Lots of them, huh?  But the girl was beautiful. 
[01:10:30]  And I swear to you, she was amazing.  Her face, everything else.  I have to say that because then we were having sex and I was losing my virginity and then decide,  well, now I got to like try all sorts of positions.  Uh-huh.  And we went for the classic, you know, the classic flip over.  The canine.  And that's when I noticed that she had some kind of weird birth defect.  And I need a doctor. 
[01:11:00]  I need maybe another girl or somebody to back this up because to this day, I don't know what it was.  I'd love to see that.  She had what could only be described as a mane that went from her neck all the way down to her tailbone.  See, now I've seen.  And it wasn't just a little peach buzz.  Right, right.  It was probably, I don't remember because this is a long time ago now, but at least a half an inch wide.  It wasn't like, it wasn't really long, but it was dark enough where there was no other hair on her back. 
[01:11:30]  So it was very defined.  Right.  And went all the way down her spine.  The birth to her tailbone.  The birth defect you're referring to is she was a man.  At the end of it, on her tailbone, did she wax it into a little curl?  Yeah, so I was telling that story on my honeymoon and I was getting laughed at, not with.  Yeah, I'd love to see somebody with that.  Yeah.  Because I know a lot of people probably get confused because, you know, sometimes you lift up a girl's hair in the back and you realize. 
[01:12:00]  Wow, it goes down a little far, you know?  Yeah, you get a little of that, but this went way past that.  Oof.  Way past that.  God, now Danny's just popping up horrid, hairy pictures.  Horrendous.  Of hair, like, nowhere near the neck or back.  This is right on the bottom.  That is horrendous.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Yeah, wonderful.  Let's say hi to cigars and scotch.  He's always good for one. 
[01:12:30]  But do you remember the days where you really had to do some hunting?  Like before, before the...  That's not real.  What is that?  Before the razors were popular?  Yeah, before razors were popular.  A guy had to do a lot of hunting.  You really had to figure out where everything went.  There was a lot of, like, well, like Moses parted the Red Sea.  You had to kind of, you know, do the same thing.  Lay your staff upon thee and... 
[01:13:00]  It did confuse some things at times.  Yeah, yeah.  And then things would get all kind of nappy.  It's just...  My brother's a huge fan.  Really?  He loves going old school.  See, I don't...  My brother loves going old school.  I always said...  He's the only one in my family that loves going old school.  I don't mind a natural triangular shape kept well-groomed and stuff. 
[01:13:30]  And not prickly, like short hair, but not like, you know, wound around in curls three or four times either.  Just some kind of...  To let you know that's the place.  Right.  Because there's just something about seeing the female form standing there without the pesky clothing on.  And when you see that, it adds to it because it's just part of the whole picture.  You know what I mean? 
[01:14:00]  Of course.  It's just...  Not that, you know...  Hey, I like that nothing there thing myself.  A lot.  I like that a lot.  I hate any of it being there.  You don't like anything.  Yeah.  And natural.  Looks like somebody yawning through a cheesecloth.  Just disgusting.  Lazy, you chimp.  Well, no one's backing me up.  That's great.  You chimp.  Let's say hi to Jared.  Jared, what's up?  Jared.  Jared. 
[01:14:30]  You do that too good, by the way.  Thank you.  I know what that birth defect is.  Yeah.  It's called a wookie.  Yeah.  That's the old...  Thank you.  That was the bit.  Yeah.  It would do the bit.  But...  Yeah, whatever.  So, I don't know what that birth defect is.  Never saw it after that.  Good thing.  And I don't think I've ever seen a picture of someone that has that. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Oh, stunt brain?  Stunty might have something for us.  What do you got for us?  Yeah, this one's kind of weird.  You might have been with a very unique woman.  Really?  Because this...  Apparently, even in all the medical sites I've gone to, it's very rare.  But it's a testosterone production that happens in the ovaries during infancy.  And they say once those follicles are activated, they tend to stay activated.  But it's very rare among women.  Can you transplant them?  I wonder.  Can you take the follicles and put them on someone's head? 
[01:15:30]  Put it in Anthony's head?  Is it like a mane, though?  It goes right...  In some women, it goes straight down the back...  Holy crap!  That's...  And it's a rare thing?  Really rare.  Because this woman had written the doctors about her five-year-old daughter.  There you go.  Wow.  You're with a special, special girl.  There you go.  One in millions.  One in millions, really?  Yeah, according to...  I remember her telling me that her sister had it, too.  Because I had to go, what the hell is a family thing?  I go, what the hell is a family thing?  I was like a little freaked out.  Did you ask her? 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  And she was open about it.  She was cool about it?  Oh, did she just come out and be cool about it?  Or did you have to say...  I was a little freaked out.  I was like, wow.  They do tell the mother that she needs to choose her daughter's summer clothes carefully  to avoid the child being picked on.  See?  See?  Saddle?  What's the name of that?  Whatever, Chaka Wart?  Some sort of overactive...  Testosterone production in the body.  Happens before puberty.  What about electrolysis? 
[01:16:30]  Can't that take care of it?  It says electrolysis, shaving, or very expensive laser treatments.  Laser.  Wow.  Take a lightsaber to a head.  Let's go to Cigars and Scotch.  Freak.  Cigars.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  I had a bad sex and food story.  It's more like candy and sex.  Yeah.  They used to have a candy called Fizz Whiz, which is like Pop Rocks today.  Sure.  It starts exploding in your mouth the minute it hits the moisture.  Yep.  I figured I'd have some while doing something else, but didn't pour it in my mouth. 
[01:17:00]  Don't I impress her?  Didn't.  Oh, no.  Wait a minute.  You...  You...  Yeah.  God.  Did it look like a...  Did it look like a rabid dog?  A lot of cursing.  Oh, my God.  That's...  Yeah, that's no good.  A little freaky.  I was...  A little freaky with some food.  I was telling my sex and food story during the break, and Stumpering goes, yeah, the...  What were they called?  Candy pants. 
[01:17:30]  Candy panties.  Candy panties.  Like, my girlfriend at college, we tried the candy panties thing.  They're horrid.  They looked ridiculous.  They're so dumb.  By the time she said, come on in, like, the whole front of it was melted because she  was in heat.  Now it just looked like a red cherry mess.  Smelled like Luca Brasi's dress. 
[01:18:00]  When you first put it on, it looks like some kind of diaper because now, you know...  One size fits all.  That's what it was.  Yeah.  So it's this giant panel in the front and back.  What it amounts to is a fruit roll-up with, like, licorice whips for strings on the side.  So they put these things on, and like I was just talking about,  but back in the day, before the real shaving went on, that was another catastrophe.  Yeah.  Because, oof.  Now that got mixed in with the...  Yeah, it got mixed in with the fruity goodness of the... 
[01:18:30]  Actually, it wasn't even goodness.  Those things were horrible.  No.  Tasting.  It was horrendous.  Just stupid.  That's one of those, like, things you feel like you have to do at some point in your sexual  career, and then you realize, no, this is stupid.  There's things like that.  Like, the food thing is another one, where it's like, let's just, like, run strawberries  over each other, and then slowly I'll feed them to you.  And then you realize, this is doing nothing for me.  When do I get to put this in that? 
[01:19:00]  Because that's the whole, you know, end game here.  Running strawberries over each other.  Let's get some whipped cream.  Yeah, because in 10 minutes, when that stuff starts getting warm, and starts stinking  like sour milk...  Because you've got to spice up, you know, the sex.  If you have to spice up the sex or that kind of thing, you don't have the chemistry.  Move on.  No, spicing up.  Move on.  Stop with the spice.  Let's say hi to Helene, it looks like. 
[01:19:30]  Helene?  Yes.  New Jersey, you got this birth defect.  Um, it's not as bad as the main, but it's called hirsutism, and it's, um, an overabundance  of testosterone in women.  It's very...  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  Thanks for checking us out.  We, uh, greatly appreciate that.  We certainly do.  People are digging the, uh, Miss Rotten Crotch contest.  Are they?  Although no women are calling. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, isn't that odd?  I want to know if women will do this or not.  If there's a good cash prize.  For good cash?  I mean, what is it?  If you come in, you're a little messy, uh, somebody gives a little smell, you judge, you  get judged, and then you could always, uh, wash immediately, and you might, uh, go home  with some cash.  Yeah, and you could be a very, uh, hmm, a very, let's, uh, a very normal girl.  I'm trying to keep it so they don't dump out. 
[01:20:30]  And then you, you, you turn yourself into something that might win this contest, if you  know what I mean.  By using certain things.  Yeah.  I think 55-gallon drum challenge.  Yeah, that kind of stuff.  And then give it an old rub-a-dub-dub with some of those goods, and, uh, we have a contest.  And we got a winner.  Jeff in Chicago.  Hey, Jeff.  Hey there, Jeff.  Yeah.  What's up, Jeff?  Hey, uh, you guys have to have Bob Kelly judge Miss Rock and Crotch. 
[01:21:00]  Aw.  Yeah, you're right.  Guaranteed.  Guaranteed the throw-up.  We're looking for the people that would be horrified to be judges.  Iraq is, uh, a guarantee.  Bob Kelly's a guarantee.  Maybe we need a third judge.  I'm trying to think.  Who else?  Yeah, Bob Kelly would be perfect for this.  Oh, you think Voss?  Voss is good, too, yeah.  He gags pretty good.  He does.  Yeah, Voss would be...  He gags pretty good.  Voss would be pretty good with that.  Yes, you're right.  877-212-0&A.  We're looking for one girl to start the competition by saying, I would be in. 
[01:21:30]  I would go for the title Miss Rotten Crotch.  Yeah.  877-212-0&A.  Uh, did you hear about Joe Satriani?  And I thought this was, like, a bunch of BS, and then I realized that we actually, uh, touched  on this.  Satriani is, um, is suing Coldplay.  Why?  Because he claims that, uh, uh, Viva La Vida, the big Coldplay song.  Yeah.  Uh, was ripped off from his song, If I Could Fly.  And I remember we played a little snippet of both and went, wow. 
[01:22:00]  Really?  Let me, my woman...  And then we just kind of moved on with our show, thought nothing of it, but, uh, now it's  coming out today or over the weekend that, uh, Joe Satriani is indeed suing Coldplay.  Um, let me get it really fast.  So Coldplay, here's a little taste of, uh, their hit song.  Okay.  All right. 
[01:22:30]  Everyone knows that song.  Yeah.  How could you not, even if you're not a Coldplay fan, they play that song everywhere.  And then, uh, this is Joe Satriani, If I Could Fly.  Oh, my God. 
[01:23:00]  I didn't even...  You know, I sort of remember doing this, and I didn't realize how close it was until just  now.  He didn't even try to change anything.  Coldplay is giving up some of their profits.  Simple as that.  Hey, Danny, can you do me a favor? 
[01:23:30]  It sounds like a Gary Howey version.  I need, uh, I need Satriani on one disc and Coldplay on one disc.  I want to play them at the same exact time.  Can we do that?  What I was trying to look for you just, uh, right here, someone actually already did that  on YouTube.  It syncs up perfectly.  It's the same time.  Oh, really?  Cool.  Same pitch.  Let me, let me, let me burn this for you real quick, and I'll run it in.  All right.  Very good.  Yeah, stick around for that, because it's not even, like, this is, like, identical.  Sometimes when these lawsuits happen, you're like, ah, come on.  I mean, there's only so many riffs you can come up with in music, but this one... 
[01:24:00]  That's the whole thing.  It's the whole thing.  You're right.  Uh, so, yeah, Satriani, uh, filed the suit December 4th, a mere couple days ago, and  he's, he's had it.  You know, Satriani, you know, he's, he's done okay for himself, but he's not made Coldplay  money.  So, who, uh, who actually had it first?  Coldplay.  I mean, uh, Joe Satriani, obviously.  Satriani had it first.  Yeah, Coldplay...  Oh, okay.  I thought Satriani ripped it off.  Hell no.  Oh.  Satriani's suing Coldplay.  All right. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, so...  Yeah, for Coldplay to sue Satriani is kind of like, you know, what are you beating up this  guy for?  Yeah, no kidding.  Money coming out your, uh...  Don't you make enough money?  Yeah.  So...  Okay, now it makes sense.  And we'll have the version where it's, uh, synced up perfectly in a, in a minute or two.  Uh, we lost Jimmy.  Jimmy went, uh, to the bathroom to do a little something-something, and I went in the same  bathroom to do a little something-something.  Oh, wow.  And then we had, we had dueling, uh, something-somethings.  Sound like...  But I, uh, was able to end in time to come back, and he's still in there. 
[01:25:00]  You guys just love doing that, uh, during the day.  More the better, man.  I'll, in an extreme emergency, I'll do it before I leave the house.  Really?  Um, yeah.  And then if it's, if I don't, and then there's an extreme emergency, then I'll use the bathroom  here.  But otherwise, uh, wait till I get home.  520, like clockwork, my friend.  Jesus.  Every morning at 520 when we're doing the radio show, like clockwork. 
[01:25:30]  Take the old paper in there, and, uh, and start prepping for the show.  Heather, Cleveland, how are you?  Heather.  Hi.  Hi.  She said she would totally do the contest, and then she hangs up when we go to her.  Our phone, uh, screwed up, or...  Yeah, let's go to Sean in Georgia.  Sean.  Hey, uh, uh, if you, if you search Viva La Vida ripoff on YouTube, there's another band  that has another song that's pretty similar to Coldplay.  It looks like Coldplay's soul from both of them.  It's, uh...  The way the lyrics go and everything. 
[01:26:00]  I can't remember what the other band's name is.  Well, I was gonna blow it off.  Yeah, right?  I was gonna blow it off, but now that you've brought it to our attention, I think the band's  called Creaky Boards.  The pendulum, it swings the other way.  And, uh, the song is The Songs I Didn't Write.  Yeah, but if you could play that...  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  I'm gonna...  Ah!  We've gone to bed, and I am all alone inside my head.  I turn on the stereo, the one only I can know. 
[01:26:30]  It sounds like Chris Martin singing, too.  A little different, but...  But, yeah, similar.  Very similar.  Very similar.  But the Joe Satriani, just ridiculous.  Yeah.  What, did Coldplay think no one knew Joe Satriani?  I can understand maybe Coldplay going, you know what, Creaky Boards? 
[01:27:00]  Come on.  Yeah.  Who's gonna believe Creaky Boards?  But Joe Satriani, he's kind of been, you know, around and has done okay for himself.  Right?  Man.  Heather's calling back for the contest.  Oh, goody.  Heather, what's up?  Hi, what's up?  Hey.  Hi.  So, you would do the contest?  I would.  I mean, I kind of felt bad for you guys, because, you know, no one was, like, calling in public,  or whatever.  Oh, thank you.  I think the women are in a, you know, they're in shock, because they're, like, they're doing  what? 
[01:27:30]  I think, yeah, a lot of girls are, like, too embarrassed to be, like, oh, I do that, you  know, but I don't care.  Well, are you...  It's not like you're saying you're walking around like that every day, you know, you're  just...  No, that's what...  The contest for money.  That's what the women gotta understand.  We're...  I mean, you're making yourself win this contest, if you know what I mean.  Yeah.  So, as a female, you're doing, as a female, you're doing certain things to get the title.  Yes.  It's not like, you know, on a normal day, someone would call you that. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, exactly.  And I think girls are, like, too fast, they call up and say, like, oh, my name's this,  and I'll do it.  People are gonna be like, oh, did you call up and do that?  Are you saying something?  Are you, like, trying to say something?  I think it'd be pretty cool if, you know, you girls did this contest.  Yeah.  Bragging rights.  Bragging rights.  Look what I want on the O.P. and Anthony show, right?  Yeah.  All right, very cool.  So, Heather, when we make the contest official, you call back up and you'll be in on the contest.  All right, right on.  All right, cool.  Here it is.  Danny, did you listen to this? 
[01:28:30]  I sure did.  Is it good?  It's excellent.  All right, with Satriani suing Coldplay, somebody on YouTube should get the credit.  They put the two songs in sync.  I had to know they were gonna do that.  And this is how it sounds.  I used to read it.  Seize the lives of the day.  Now we're gonna stay.  Wow.  Seize the city's school.  Woo! 
[01:29:00]  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo! 
[01:29:30]  They're both playing at the same time there.  Yeah.  The one anyone confused.  Wow, Satriani's got a payday coming to him.  Yeah, I think so.  That's unbelievable.  Good for him.  He hasn't done anything that people want to hear in years.  You ever into Satriani?  I had to play it a few times.  Nothing against Joe, but I never got into the big guitar gods, solo guitar gods. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, that was always something I just could.  Dude, Yngwie.  Yngwie Malmsteen.  Yngwie, dude, you got to go see Yngwie.  Yngwie's pretty cool, though.  Yeah, but you know something?  I am not going to an Yngwie concert and sitting there and watch this self-indulgent douche go through his songs and just play a bunch of leads for me.  And Joe Satriani, and who else?  Who are some of those other guys?  Well, some of the other guitars we got. 
[01:30:30]  Steve Vai.  Oh, Steve Vai.  Steve Vai.  I know these guys got huge followings.  It was just one of the genres I was never into.  Yeah, I'm not into just listening to one guitarist going off.  Gary Hoey's kind of cool because it's, you know.  It's ho-ho-hoey.  Ho-ho-hoey.  It's Christmassy kind of stuff.  How could he not like ho-ho-hoey?  Ho-ho-hoey.  Yeah, this is, you know, kind of fun. 
[01:31:00]  Is this your mean one?  No, this is Yngwie Malmsteen.  Oh, oh, oh.  See, I don't even know the difference.  Sounds like Gary Hoey.  Yeah, sorry.  Can you get me ho-ho-hoey doing The Grinch?  I would not watch this.  I would sit there.  What do you do?  You can't sing along to it.  You just rock to it?  There's a YouTube video of Yngwie Malmsteen trying to show you a scale.  And he goes, he shows it to you in real time. 
[01:31:30]  And he's like, let me slow it down for you.  And like, I'm trying to, I'm sitting there with my guitar trying to do this.  Oh, God.  And him slowed down is way too fast for me.  Really?  I can't do anything.  It's ridiculously fast.  You think he would be good at Guitar Hero?  You know, I don't know.  Dude, it's weird because some people who actually, who play very well just can't seem to get the game now.  I would love to see Satriani try to do Guitar Hero.  That's a stupid song.  What's the big song on Guitar Hero?  I can never know that.  Through the Fire and Flames.  Yeah, exactly.  Yes.  You know, Satriani on my first CD, Steve had put a, remember that thing that you did for me? 
[01:32:00]  It was a radio bill.  Roman War Helmets.  Oh, that's right.  We had to go ask Joe for permission to use one of his songs behind a bit that I did for Jimmy.  And he said no.  And he said, yeah, his people said no.  What a douche.  I took it out, though.  I took it out.  Yeah.  He's a jerk.  He's a douche.  But I took it out, and we just put another thing of music, and I'm glad that we took it out.  That's right.  We had to get head-ass.  Why are you glad?  Because now that I know that he's suing people, I mean, not that he would me, but you never know. 
[01:32:30]  I mean, he might just object to the material on it and want to.  He's got a big-time case, though, man.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, this Coldplay song is a direct rip-off of this Joe Satriani song.  You want that ho-ho-ho-y real quick?  Yeah, yeah.  Ho-ho-ho-y.  I love this.  See?  This is rich.  You know, you're familiar with the song.  Sure.  A little ho-ho-ho-y for everybody. 
[01:33:00]  Ho-ho-ho-y.  I don't want to go to the phone call, but Dave in Jersey is like, don't forget about  Eric Johnson.  Oh, yeah.  Cliffs of Dover, right?  The Cliffs of Dover.  Cliffs of Dover.  How did that one go?  I used to have to play that one.  Give me a little Cliffs of Dover.  Well, what other songs do we got? 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  Ah.  I used this as a music bet on so many commercial reads over the years, I can't even tell you.  Kawasaki Motorcycle.  The House of Guitars.  Ten's Show Club.  Right.  Live nude girl.  This was the go-to music where you made a music bet.  Commercial read.  Especially for Slappy.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The GM would get so mad at me.  I'm like, you're using the same music bet for everything.  I'm like, yeah, because it's that damn good. 
[01:34:00]  And I don't have to pick out the vocals.  Right.  What was that?  Sir Morgan's Cove.  Sir Morgan's Cove in Worcester.  Oh, yeah.  So come on down.  Bring a friend.  There's two-for-one drink specials.  Yeah.  Shut it.  Someone rich in Connecticut.  I don't have time to go to your phone call either, but he writes, there's a video of Rush playing Guitar Hero.  I would love to see that.  Speaking of Rush, I was doing a lot of driving this weekend, so I had the Sirius XM and I was flipping around. 
[01:34:30]  And I see Rush, you know, when you see the channels and you see what bands are playing, I'm like, wow, Rush, cool.  I haven't heard a Rush song in a while, so I punch it in and I'm thinking I'm going to hear Tom Sawyer, Limelight, Trees, maybe go a little obscure, I don't know, depending on the channel.  Red Barchetta?  Red Barchetta, sure.  Red Barchetta, sure.  It was a country song.  When did Rush start doing country songs?  And it was god-awful. 
[01:35:00]  Oof.  Well, they are one of those Johnny-come-lately, if there's a trend going.  Wow.  They'll jump on it, as we saw them with the rap.  Roll the bones.  Roll the bones.  Rush rap.  I was so depressed.  Oh, I know what it was.  I was going to the Islander game.  And I'm like, oh, Rush before the Islanders?  This works.  Rush.  And I popped it in, and it sounded like Geddy Lee.  And then I'm thinking, okay, wow, maybe it's a new song.  All right, it is a new song.  And then I'm like, wait a minute.  This is on a country station.  Well, the man who hold high places must be the one start. 
[01:35:30]  Mold a new reality, close to the heart.  What's that new Rush song?  The house next door to me.  Yeah, that's a good song.  Let's say hi to Jay on Long Island.  Jay.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Have you guys heard about Michelangelo Bacchio?  Michelangelo is this guitarist that has an X-frame guitar with four guitar necks 
[01:36:00]  and it spins on his chest.  Why?  I don't know.  I'm not at all.  I didn't like all that gimmick stuff with my rock and roll.  Gimmicky stuff.  Like the big gong.  The double neck guitars.  The guy's incredible like the guitarist.  That is a great.  And he spins it around and plays it around with a clown.  Oh, really?  That's stupid.  I hope his face gets caught on the neck.  That just says, look at me. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Just please look at me.  I can't really play well, so I'm going to be a gimmick guy.  I'm going to go with the gimmick.  What was the band with the chainsaw?  Jackal?  Gimmick stuff like that.  I play the chainsaw.  All right, listen.  We just played Gary Hoey.  Yes.  And for the most part, we hate Christmas songs.  But I've got to give props to Ron and Fez. 
[01:37:00]  Propellers?  I don't even know if it's a contest, but they're trying to come up with brand new Christmas songs.  Have you heard them doing this?  Yes, I have.  Completely original.  Just have people make up Christmas songs and send them in.  Because they're basically saying it's time for some new Christmas songs.  Some new classics.  And I've got to tell you, I'm taking a chance here, but I don't care.  What the hell?  Who knows how much longer we've got on regular radio.  They played a song by Sleeves.  Have you heard of his song yet?  You're a big Sleeves fan.  You don't like the Sleeves? 
[01:37:30]  No, I'm kind of mixed.  I think some of his stuff is genius.  I'm a big Sleeves fan.  And I think some of his stuff sucks.  I'm a big, big Sleeves fan.  This is what Ron and Fez are doing this?  Yeah, did you hear this song yet?  No.  Sleeves did a song called Christmas Song.  And I can't get this damn thing out of my head.  Does it sound like the mod theme?  Apparently that one gets stuck.  So I asked, it's a short song.  I asked Ronnie B, you know, permission to play it on our show.  He said, yes, you know, get Sleeves some more attention.  So this is Sleeves.  It's called Christmas Song. 
[01:38:00]  It's only a couple minutes.  I want to see, and if you like this, okay?  I was listening to that, actually, when...  You don't like it?  No, no, I was listening to when it was suggested that you're a Sleeves fan, and the question  was posed to Ronnie, and as it was being posed, it goes, Opie wants to know if he can, and  before anything else came out, he goes, have Earl back?  Of course he can.  Earl, you're going back to the O&A show.  Ronnie, without missing a beat.  I was laughing my ass off. 
[01:38:30]  I don't think Ronnie will ever forgive me for suggesting Earl.  Earl.  I don't think he'll ever forgive me.  No backs, no backs, no penny tax.  Look, man, we carried him enough.  It was someone else's turn.  Here's Sleeves, Christmas Song.  Right.  Tell me what you think, okay?  Sure.  Jimmy, you too.  Yeah.  I have a feeling it's going to go, eh.  Jimmy's going to go, I need it for my iPod.  It's a catchy little song.  Ooh.  That's my guess right here. 
[01:39:00]  I was feeling pretty good for la, la, la, la, la.  Taking my time on the la, la, la, la, la.  Snow falling down in the la, la, la, la, la.  Everybody's singing like la, la, la, la.  Taking all the halls with the la, la, la, la, la.  Making my way to the la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. 
[01:39:30]  I like to drink a little beer  At the end of the day  Crawling in the town  Feel like a million miles away  We'll be right back. 
[01:40:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:40:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:41:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:41:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:42:00]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back. 
[01:42:30]  It sucks.  It sounds like any douchebag trying to come up with a horrible song.  Well, it kind of makes me feel like a la-la-la-la.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What is a la-la-la-la?  It means Christmas is coming, what?  Yeah. 
[01:43:00]  There's a lot of fa-la-la-la-la-la songs.  Our new president's a la-la-la-la.  He could use it.  I mean, you can strategically put that in.  Spud's Buckley used to say, la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I tried to share.  I liked it.  I normally enjoy your music picks.  You're batting about 850 with me on music picks.  Usually a very good one.  La-la-la-la.  La-la-la-la.  Obscure and weird taste in music.  I have to be. 
[01:43:30]  I played all the stuff everyone knows and loves way too much on the radio, so I had to,  you know, you had to go out and discover other stuff, other music.  I love Leonard Cohen and that very creepy vibe.  La-la-la-la.  Bonnie, DC, how are you?  Hey, guys.  I called the backup.  Sorry.  It's early, and I'm a smoker.  Sorry.  I called the backup Opie because I don't want to hurt your cause, but it actually made me  choke up almost high in my car.  Loved it.  Maybe it's a chick song. 
[01:44:00]  Maybe it is.  Yeah.  Maybe it's a chick song.  And what the hell do I know?  I hope you're riding and you hit a la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  I didn't find that catchy or ending.  I found it too.  There wasn't any moment in there that was like, oh, wow, this kind of, you know, hits me where  it's like, if I heard this a couple of times, I would like this part of the song  at least or something.  You don't like the la-la-la-la-la.  It was nothing in there.  I hate the la-la-la-la-la the most.  Let's go to Amanda in White Plains.  I got to tell you, the phones, every single one is lit. 
[01:44:30]  Half of them love it.  Or not, I shouldn't say love it, but like it.  And the other half hate it.  Amanda.  I mean, it's right down the middle.  Amanda, White Plains.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  I love it.  I thought it was great.  Two chicks.  It might be a chick song.  Let's go to a guy, John in Jersey.  John.  Hey, what's up?  All I'd say is enough with the la-la-la-la-la.  We get it.  And what the hell is a hogs neck that he's sucking on?  So, I didn't get any of the songs.  No.  It's trying to be profound, I guess. 
[01:45:00]  La-la-la.  To me, it's like, yeah.  The song would have been more.  La-la-la-la.  Come on.  Let's play it again.  What is the la-la-la?  Is that like a 7-Eleven?  Let's play it again.  We're going to play a Nambla meeting.  Going to the la-la-la.  Going to the la-la-la-la.  Whatever.  Wait.  Can we try to figure out what the la-la-la-la?  Can we stop at each one and figure out what the la-la-la-las are?  La-la-la-la-la-la.  We have to take a break.  Hold on.  Stunt Tool is saying that we have to take a break.  We have to take a la-la-la-la.  La-la-la-la.  We've got to pay some la-la-la-las.  It ain't going to work again today.  I'm sorry. 
[01:45:30]  I'd rather hear, Lady Godiva was a freedom rider.  By the way, does it bring your father to work day?  Oh, this is our new intern.  What do you mean?  This is our new intern.  With this desperate?  How old are you?  38.  38?  And you're an intern?  He's a 38-year-old intern.  He looks like Steve.  I have a safe fell on him.  Say hello.  How are you, fellas?  How are you doing there?  Hi, Tim.  I'm good.  I'm good.  Scott.  Look at you.  Scott.  See that?  Scott's our intern.  He's 38.  For real?  For real.  For real. 
[01:46:00]  What made you decide to be an intern?  At 38.  I was an electrician.  Yeah.  You know.  Automate.  I hear you in the trades.  The trades.  They suck.  Yeah, they do.  They do suck.  You can say that.  You're allowed.  So what?  You figure you want to get into radio, and this is the shoe-in?  No, not really.  Went to CSB.  Graduated.  Oh, you did?  Yep.  Okay.  And then they place you?  They sort of place you.  Yeah.  With the help of yourself.  Of course.  Wow.  So, yep.  Here I am.  All right.  Surfing the net.  Found the opening. 
[01:46:30]  Sent them a resume.  Damn.  Steve, I know you told us we were desperate for interns, but my God.  Come on.  No, that's not right.  That's not right.  By the time you're 60, you might have a show in Utah somewhere.  Alabama.  Good for you.  What the hell?  I'll take it.  Hey, Joe Benigno did it on the fan.  He got a gig like that.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  No, I got respect for this guy.  Good.  La, la, la, la.  You don't like your job.  La, la, la, la, la.  Yeah, you got a crappy job.  You got something you really want to do, and then the guy's not just sitting around on  his ass talking about it. 
[01:47:00]  He's actually doing it.  I'm trying.  I'm trying.  Now, get me some coffee.  All right.  You like it.  Now, go get your shine box.  Nice ice.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Okay.  All right.  The phones are lit, so we'll take a break.  We're going to try to figure out the la, la's after the break.  Yes.  I like this song.  I have no problem saying it.  This song stinks so nice.  Ann hates it.  Jimmy, hate it.  I didn't hate it, but the la, la, la, la's, I have a tremendous issue with.  Are we dumping it, or are we pumping it?  Dude, I can't tell you how much I don't like it. 
[01:47:30]  That's how bad it is.  You just don't like his vibe, I guess.  It's like early Tom Waits.  You're never into that type of stuff.  No.  Give me a hit.  Give me something that's on the radio.  It's a hit.  John in New Jersey wants Sleeve to drown in a la, la, la, la lake.  Scott in Jersey, that sucked.  Steve and PA agree with Hope.  It's catchy.  Allen in Brooklyn.  The song is gay, gay, gay, gay. 
[01:48:00]  I like it, Sleeves.  I know he listens to the show.  Burt Reynolds used to punch la, la, la, la, la.  And then, you know, someone has to take a shot at me.  What's up with this?  Mauro from Jersey writes, Opie listens to this song while he burns a java.  La, la, la.  Going on a boat to dump la, la, la, la.  I like it. 
[01:48:30]  I like it.  We're going to figure out the la, la's next, all right?  Save the rest of your la, la's for after the break.  We need something for the last break today.  What the hell?  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  La, la, la, la.  La, la, la.  Opie and Anthony.  La, la, la.  La, la, la.  La, la.  La, la, la.  La, la.  La, la.  I thought I would bring a song to the show.  Ron and Fez are doing a great contest.  I don't know if it's an official contest, but basically they're trying to come up with brand new Christmas songs. 
[01:49:00]  because we're all sick of all the Christmas songs you hear every year, right?  Yeah, same ones.  There hasn't been a new Christmas classic in many, many years.  And most of the ones Ron and Fez are playing, you know, suck.  But this one song by Sleeves, I really liked,  and I thought we should bring it to our show.  And Jimmy hates it.  Anthony absolutely hates it.  Jimmy doesn't hate it, right?  See, do you hate it, Jimmy?  No, but I don't like it.  He doesn't like it.  I cannot even describe how much I hate that song. 
[01:49:30]  Like, if that was a song that was on the radio,  I would hit the button to turn it off within one note.  I hear the emotion.  I'll eliminate that song in one note.  You hear the emotion coming from the guy.  Emotion.  First of all, there's no Christmassy sound to it.  You want to know more about this guy after he sings a song like that.  No Christmassy sound to it at all.  Drinking his beers, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la.  And then he goes to the la, la, la, la.  Yeah.  What is it?  It's the Christmas season. 
[01:50:00]  It stinks.  It doesn't sound Christmassy.  Like, deck the halls with boughs of holly.  Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la.  That's fine because the la, la's in that are just like you're singing.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Why is that fine?  What does that mean?  Deck the halls with boughs of holly.  You're taking a lot of holly, some boughs of it.  They don't even sell holly anymore.  Deck the halls with it.  What the F is holly?  That's how old the song is.  It stinks.  That's fine stuff, I think.  That's why you need songs by sleeves.  I think I have holly on my mantle in my house. 
[01:50:30]  I've got holly there.  You need, like, new Christmas songs.  Yeah, but this ain't it.  Huh?  This ain't it.  La, la, la, la.  You said it before, Opie.  This is Jeff B. from Austin.  He writes, Ant can't handle anything sentimental or introspective.  Shut your mouth.  I can too.  It's because his soul was smashed against the wall along with a wad of pasta.  Sleeves rules.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Sleeves may rule.  Look, I'm not saying the guy might not rule.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  That song stinks. 
[01:51:00]  Well, can we hear a little bit?  Because I forgot what it sounds like.  Did you?  Yeah, watch.  Thanks, Jimmy.  This song, if you love it or hate it, this will be something you'll be humming along at work today.  I'm sorry.  It's sticking your head like when you see a dead person's head twisted off from a car wreck.  Same thing.  You can't forget that either.  It makes me kind of pleasant.  It kind of makes me happy.  What, the head on the other?  No, the la, la, la, la, la.  The la, la, all right.  Yeah, it brings you back to being a little kid and, you know, discovering how cool Christmas is.  Now it just sucks Christmas.  We all know that. 
[01:51:30]  It just brings you back a little bit.  Sleeves.  Christmas song.  I was feeling pretty good for la, la, la, la.  Taking my time on the la, la, la, la.  Breaking my time on the la, la, la.  What is that?  You don't have to know what it is.  Yes, you do.  What is that?  A new bus?  A new train in Los Angeles?  On the la, la, la, la.  What is it?  You don't need your lyrics to make sense.  It's an emotion you feel. 
[01:52:00]  For a Christmas song?  It better make sense.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  It better make sense.  This, it sucks.  Why?  It sucks.  There's, like, all hell's breaking loose out there in the real world, and Sleeves has  given us a little hope with his la, la, la, la.  Hope, hope, what?  Hope, what?  That he thinks of words?  Just getting sentimental and remembering happier times, you know, around this fine Christmas  season.  He's going to...  All right.  It's a peppy song. 
[01:52:30]  I was feeling pretty good for la, la, la, la.  Taking my time on the la, la, la, la.  Snow falling down in the la, la, la, la.  Right there.  What is snow falling down in the la, la, la, la?  What does that mean?  What is the la, la?  The snow could fall down in what?  I don't need to know what the la, la is.  I do.  I do, too.  You don't really need to know.  The snow's falling down.  It should even be the snow.  Look, look, I'll even be ridiculous and go with this for a second.  All right.  How about the snow's falling down on the la, la, la, la?  Yeah.  Why? 
[01:53:00]  Well, it's going into a la, la, la, la.  It's falling into that.  What does that mean?  It doesn't need a meaning.  It does.  It just gives you a little, like, emotion.  It gives you...  I like it.  Snow's falling down in the la, la, la hood.  That's all I can think of.  Yeah.  It just falls in there.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la.  You'll be humming it all day.  You watch.  You watch.  When you start humming it, you call me up and say, you know, and curse me out.  I don't care.  It's la, la, lazy.  He didn't come up with words.  No. 
[01:53:30]  So he threw la, la in there.  It's catchy.  No.  He could have come up with words, real words that rhymed.  But it's too much la, la work.  Bad musicians like sleeves say la, la, la, la because they can't think of lyrics.  Of la, la lyrics.  You're exactly right, Heather.  That's Heather on Long Island.  Thank you.  I disagree, Heather.  Heather is absolutely right.  Everybody's singing like la, la, la, la.  Decking all the halls with the la, la, la, la.  Make of my way.  It's far like you're decking the halls with Holly, not la, la, la.  What?  You don't throw la, la, la in the hallway. 
[01:54:00]  Why not?  What is it?  Where do I get it?  You're just throwing around the Christmas spirit.  I've never bought a la, la, la, la in my life.  How do you know?  Because I know.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la.  Making my way to the la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  This guy's head should be la, la, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la. 
[01:54:30]  I like to drink a little beer  At the end of the day  And go rolling in the town  Be like a million miles away  Not as snowy like a sea  Like a sand above the beach  The lights rolling in the trees  And people shining in the street  And the people in the light  All the children in the light  Singing holy, holy night 
[01:55:00]  Didn't that just give you a chill?  No.  Yeah, it certainly did.  What kind, Ant?  Of the douche variety, you ass  I got a little chill there  I got a little chill in my la, la, la, la  I don't even know what he's singing about  But you know what?  You know what?  I don't need  Da, da, da, douche  I don't need everything spelled out for me  There's a lot going on in this song  I can spell it out  L-A, L-A, repeat  La, la, la, la  I got a little chill there 
[01:55:30]  It's droning  Fricking a little beer at the end of the day  Come on, who doesn't like that?  A little beer at the end of the day  After your day of hell  Why, then put on one bourbon, one scotch, one beer  And at least that's an up-peppy song  You know what it's about?  It's not  The landlord is looking for him  He doesn't say la, la, la, la  The landlord's looking for him  He's out drinking  The landlord is on his heels  There's plenty of beer drinking songs  This is all about  Eins, zwei, drei, sphere  There's beer drinking songs all over 
[01:56:00]  This is all  There it is  Here it is, see?  He's telling a story  The house went blue  No la, la, la, la  Yeah, but the la, la, la, la  You're taking a break from  By the way  From what's going on around you  I hate this song, too  Yeah, this thing stinks  Terrible  Might we get it?  You're drunk  George Starrer gets terrible  Seek help  Takes five minutes to get to the hook  One burp  All right, thank you  Exactly  I said, look, man  La, la, la, la, man  Let me get back to sleeves  And the la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
[01:56:30]  Huh?  Yeah  Are you liking it?  Second  Stump Brain likes it?  Ugh, I don't want to like anything you like  That sucks  I want someone cool to like this with me  Someone cool  Wow  Danny, you like it?  I consider you cool  You know what?  I like sleeve stuff  Some of it's weird  Yes  But I like it  La, la, la, la, la  And you don't need to know what he's singing about  You kind of get a feel that there's a lot going on here  I've got a communique from Dr. Steve  All right  Who's got his own thing  He goes, I think la, la, la, la is just artistic license for etc 
[01:57:00]  But then he goes, I think he's making the point that Christmas is so stereotypical for all of us  That you can say la, la, la, la, and we all get the same images invoked  Wow, nice  I like that  The la, la, la, la is the store that you go into to do your Christmas shopping  The la, la, la, la is where the snow is falling into  Which is what?  A garbage pail in the street?  Sometimes the snow falls in that 
[01:57:30]  Whatever  In your boot?  I would love to talk to sleeves  I don't like it though  I love to talk to sleeves about the song  But I hear he's a weirdo  Is he really weird?  It's a little strange  I love the guy, I want to know more about him  Randy needs to gain more weight  La, la, la, la, la  She's the biggest teeth I've ever seen on a human  I know  She looks like a praying mantis  La, la, la, la  Randy's got teeth like a la, la, la, la 
[01:58:00]  She's feeling pretty good  La, la, la, la  See, I was feeling good  Fa, la, la, la  Fa, la, la, la  Because the Christmas season just knocks you down  And you're like, ugh, I've got to deal with this crap again  And he's simplifying  It's like, you know what?  I feel pretty good for the la, la, la, la  He's saying the first fa, la, la, la, la  Doesn't bother me  Because I'm feeling pretty good  He's saying Christmas  Right  But then after that it just bugged me  Then after that it bothered me  It went on to  Oh, Cody from Wisconsin  What?  Suck it 
[01:58:30]  Wait, hold on  What's wrong?  It's just  I'm tired of people  It's just a Christmas song  What did Cody say?  Well, Cody will say it himself  Go ahead, Cody  Yeah, I think it's just too deep for Ant to understand  It's too deep for me  Yes, leaves is much too deep for me, man  He doesn't like something where somebody's got to think of something  Oh, shut up  The day la, la becomes too deep for me  Shoot me  Cody, what do you think it means, Cody? 
[01:59:00]  Whatever, you rich faggot  Shut up, you Wisconsin piece of crap  You Wisconsin trash  You trash  You trash  Wisconsin trash  I don't think you're going to get this  Your whole state sucks  Go  Go  Go  Go  Go teabag your father  Teabag your father  Go get your plugs  La, la, la, la  They're not plugs  They're la, la, la, la  La, la, la  You got it 
[01:59:30]  I went to the hair store for la, la, la, la  No, for la, la, la, locks  Shut up  That's funny  La, la, la, la, locks  La, la, la, locks  I love when people say hair plugs and you have to say hair restoration  Cody  Shut up  I think  Your trendy name  Go blow  I don't think he got to Cody  I'm sorry  Hey, Cody  You're usually good  But I think Cody got the best  I think a cheese hat got the best  La, la, la, la  Alright, back to the la, la  I'm pretty good  For la, la, la, la 
[02:00:00]  Taking my time on the la, la, la, la  Snow falls down in the la, la, la, la  Everybody's singing like la, la, la, la  Decking on a hard with the la, la, la, la  Making my way to the la, la, la, la, la  La, la, la, la, la  What?  La, la, la  What?  What?  What?  What are you doing?  What?  What are you doing?  This sucks  What? 
[02:00:30]  What?  What?  What?  Let's go to Ed on Long Island  Ed  Ed, what's up?  How you doing?  I don't know, Anthony  Why do you have such a problem on la, la, la, la  When the police had a song  I hated the police  Hey  I'm not a police fan either  What's wrong with the police?  I only liked that one song  Walking on the Moon?  No  Roxanne  Synchronicity 2  I can't stand losing you  That's mediocre  I can't stand losing  I can't stand losing 
[02:01:00]  I hated the repetition in any police song  Even that one  But there was just  There was a very cool harmonic thing they did in that song  That was very good during the chorus  And that's why I liked it  You didn't like the police?  I didn't like the police  A little spirits in the material world?  No  It was all just  Rehumanized?  They were so repetitive in every song  It's like, alright, we get it  Ah, it was a big police fan  Something he likes walking on the moon  Yeah  I know my legs  You don't like that little reggae beat they got going at times? 
[02:01:30]  Walking on the moon  Walking on the moon  Yeah, you're walking on the moon  We get it  Everything  That's too big without you  Come on  You don't have to repeat the same line 80 times, Sting  See, I'm not even going with the hits  I'm going with some of the deeper stuff  For the peeps out there  Yeah  Let's go to Dominic in Virginia  He's got a little something on the  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  I can't  I can't  I can't stand losing my hair  Oh, that guy needs some credit  Alright, that's Hans  Yeah, but you know what? 
[02:02:00]  In all fairness  In all fairness  What guy can?  Every guy talks about their stupid hair  And what's going on with it  Dominic, Virginia  You don't think I'm  You don't think I'm paying close attention  To what's going on with Ant and his hair?  I'm about two years behind him  And if this works, I'm like  I'm right there  I'm the guinea pig  No kidding, you are  La, la, la, la  Hey, that's good  La, la, la, la 
[02:02:30]  Shove your quick break up your ass  La la la  Put that break in your la la la  Dominic in Virginia  We're wrapping up the show  I didn't thank Ant for a hits guy  But secondly, Dr. Steve kind of took my thunder  I think you guys are kind of reading into it a little too much  It's just, you know  Don't read too much in the fa la la  This substitutes for me  Whatever he meant by it, you know  It could make perfect sense  What about his tone? What about his voice?  I don't like his voice 
[02:03:00]  I don't like the droning of the song  La la la  It's familiar Christmas sounds, you know  Included in his sound  And I just, you kind of have to read a little deeper  Familiar Christmas, it's a droning  Funeral dirge  I dare say he's a genius  With his work  I dare say he's a genius  Where did he fit on that English list?  La la la la  The cartoon guy  And the guy that invented Preparation H  The guy that invented ShamWow 
[02:03:30]  Douche  Let's go to Melissa  I'll give you one hand  I've been stacking the deck a little bit  I've been stacking the deck  I'll give you one  I'll give you one  I'll give you one hand  I'll give you one hand  Melissa Jersey, go ahead  Hey Anthony, I gotta agree with you  That song is absolutely horrendous  Thank you  I have never heard a song as bad as that  Isn't it terrible?  There's no catchy hook to it  The la la la is the catch  No, it's not the catch  It's gonna get catchier than that  No, yes you can 
[02:04:00]  La la la la  Believe me  The ShamWow  Bill Burr bought some  Yeah  What an idiot  He said he'd have more success  Sopping something up with a plastic bag  That was great  A plastic bag  Those are no good for sopping things up  No, literal Jim  Let's go to Mike in Jersey  Mikey  Oh, I hate you man  First it's the banana phone  Then it's the internet  It's for porn  Now I'm gonna go around  And sing a la la la song 
[02:04:30]  The whole time  Oh, you'll be thinking about us  All day today  I'm telling you that much  Whether you love it or hate it  No, you won't  Listen to one other song  And you'll forget about it  Because of Ronnie B  All weekend  La la la la  Actually, that won't catch on with me  But the Maud song is still on my head  We got 40 seconds left in the song here  Bring it home, Sleeve  Come on  I like to sit out on the pier  And look across the bay  I don't think about a thing  I feel a million miles away 
[02:05:00]  Like I'm floating from the sky  Like a storm of falling snow  Then I'm spinning through the trees  Then I'm shining in the room  All the people in the light  Now the children in the light  Singing holy, holy night  Yeah  Yeah, the rest of the song's fine  That's the only part  The end of the song is the only part 
[02:05:30]  That makes any kind of Christmas  It just has a little hope  For the children, too, man  A little hope  Yeah, great  A little hope for the children  It's special, it's wonderful  A little hope for the children  The rest of the song isn't good  The lyrics are very contrived  And it's just like  I don't like it  At all  At all  Sorry  What do you like?  What?  I'm like, aha, take on me  I like that  It's a nice guilty pleasure, sure  Of course 
[02:06:00]  I don't really mean anything by ABBA  I got in trouble last night, too  Because I forgot to tell you this one, Ant  Driving home from Philly  And Veruca Salt came on  Oh, yeah  Volcano Girls  Volcano Girls, yeah  And I was cranking it  And my girl looks at me like  She knows the story  That story, too  Of course, yeah  Because the only reason you're cranking this song  Is because it's bringing back memories  Of your girlfriend  Yeah  Yup  Me and Ant could have 
[02:06:30]  Could have had some fun with these two  Back at AF  But we were good boys  Dummies  There were sparks flying  We were idiots  Sparks flying  Sparks all over the place  Could have had sex with Veruca Salt  What did we do?  No, no, no  Nothing  No, no  Didn't do anything  Because I had a wife  No, no, no, no  No, no  Can't do it  No, no, no  I'd have jebbed it right into the  La, la, la, la  And you know what? 
[02:07:00]  Every time there's Veruca Salt  And there's literally, what?  Two songs they did that anyone cared about?  Every time one of them comes on the satellite radio  I crank it up  And then I have to tell the story again  And finally she goes  I know  Maybe you shouldn't tell her that story  You know how many times you've told me this story?  Maybe you shouldn't tell her that story  So many times  For the people playing along at home  The blonde wanted me  And the brunette wanted Ant  And I think the brunette ended up going out with David Grohl  After you passed on her  I think  Passed on her  I shouldn't say that because I'm not really sure 
[02:07:30]  But  I didn't pass on her  I was  I was  I was forced into not  Having her  You know the see there  Because I was married  Dummy  By the way  Oh what an idiot  Stupid ring I put on my finger  Oh  For her  For the music fans out there  The see there is Louise  Thank you  You regret it?  Oh god  Do I regret it?  Oh  Filling out my check with a la la la la 
[02:08:00]  That's  Oh god  That's exactly what it means  You send it to the  With a la la la la la la la  And all the people  I can't wait till my payments are over  To that la la la la  What's wrong with the money to the  Cucka cucka  La la la la  Oh I just  Oh  I like it  Which one  Which one do you want to bang at?  The one to the far left? 
[02:08:30]  Oh no  The guy in the back  That's what I meant  Um  You did  That's not the girls  Who's  That's Ruka  No  Get an old picture of them  That's like a new lineup man  Yeah  Is that  I don't even recognize  That's not the original blonde  Is that the brunette  Changing her hair to blonde?  I think it's the same chick  I think they got different  They're not  That chick is definitely different  That's Veruca Mrs. Dash  Boo  Look Jimmy 
[02:09:00]  Jimmy made the most  Disgusted face  I knew it too  I just wanted to see you  Make that face at me  Yicca  Pardon me  A boo  A boo boo boo boo  La la la la la la la la la  Stinkaroo  That's funny  Veruca  Veruca actually quit  They hired Rock  I feel pretty good  La la la la la  Taking my time on the la la la la 
[02:09:30]  Snow falling down in the la la la la  Everybody singing like la la la  La la la la  Taking all the halls of the la la la la la  Making my way to the halls  La la la la la la la la  La la la la la  La la la la  Nice  I'm with you  Me and you and duet  What do you say?  I like to drink a little beer  At the end of the day  Come on  What does this have to do with Christmas? 
[02:10:00]  It's not a Christmas song either  You're not thinking of your problems  Sounds like Grey Wolf  This is Grey Wolf's song right now  Now it's just Grey Wolf's song  And we like the Grey Wolf song  You'll like the song  Because it's Grey Wolf  And the people in the light  All the children in the light  And the light  Singing the light  Holy, holy, holy night 
[02:10:30]  I'm going to do my own version of the la la la la  La la la la  I was feeling pretty good  La la la la  Taking my time on the la la la la  Snow falling down in the la la la la  Come on, Jimmy  Give me one, Jimmy  Right here  La la la la la  Taking all the halls of the la la la  Making my way to the la la la la  La la la la la la  La la la la la la  All right, I guess we've got to get out of here 
[02:11:00]  Well, I tried  What can I tell you?  Where can they find that song, Danny?  Because there are fans out there  In the la la la la  In the ga-ga garbage  I knew that was coming  I'm sure they can find that at ronfez.net  And also they can just listen to Ron and Fez  Noon to 3 on Sirius XM  Absolutely they can  I like what Jay's saying  I'll just, you know  Because he's on the phone  But he likes  1-877-CARS-4-KIDS  Better than that song  That Cars for Kids song 
[02:11:30]  Is a winner  La la la la la la  All right, that's how we end today, I guess  If we're not here tomorrow  It's been fun  And we'll pop up somewhere soon  Because I really don't know what's going on  And I'm not even making a radio  Do we ever  If they kicked Steve Dahl out the door  What chance do we have?  Oh, you're kidding  Drop something  Pick that up  All right  We're going to the satellite radio thing  You could find us there  If things get ugly 
[02:12:00]  Right  All right  Bye, bye, bye, bye  Later, man  La la la la  Taking my time with the la la la la la  All right  We get it  Oh my God  With the la la  Opie and Anthony  Fucking cold as shit out there, man 
[02:12:30]  It sucks  But then tomorrow it's going to be 60  That's normal, so  Yeah, it's good  You know  I like it  I don't care  Glaciers break off  Fucking polar bears drown  You want to die with the earth  I'm fine by me  I don't want to die with the earth  Why do you want anything to go on without you?  I don't know  I want  When I'm gone  Everything's gone  Fuck everybody  La la la  Armageddon  I mean  What I like  It's a good question  Why would you?  I guess  I don't know  So you know that there's not complete darkness  For the rest of time 
[02:13:00]  Would you rather have a little place  A little notch in history  Not even that  Or would you rather be like right there at the end of history?  I'm starting to believe that after you die there's just darkness  But I don't want it to be just darkness for like the  For every single living thing  If I gotta be on darkness  Everyone else does  That's how I feel about it  See that scares me  What if there's leaders that think just like you  And go you know what  Fuck it  Press the button  I'm gonna be the guy that does this  Pull the chain 
[02:13:30]  Out comes the chocolate choo-choo train  Holy shit  I couldn't have gone back any further  Wow  Hey uh  Speaking of the la la la la  Who was?  A bunch of people called you out on the fact that you don't like getting sentimental and sappy  Ah they're idiots  And I asked you  I asked you today  What sentimental song do you like?  That's throwing you under the bus a little bit  Because I know you don't like  A sentimental song  I know you don't like showing off your nerve endings  And showing a little emotion here  But what gets you going a little bit? 
[02:14:00]  I gotta really give it thought  I don't know  Songs really don't move me to that point  There are ones that I'm like  Wow that's pretty good  I guess  I'll have to give it some thought  But for the most part  I'm not gonna sit there and tear up  Or anything over a song  Will you come up with one?  I will  I'll give it some thought  What about you?  You got a song that's a little sentimental  That you like listening to?  Goodbye to Romance  What's that?  Ozzy? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah it's sentimental  It's sentimental  How is an Ozzy song sentimental?  Goodbye to Romance?  Yeah  Yeah I was like questioning that too  I don't know  I'm not familiar with that number  Well he was written I believe  For his wife  About his divorce over his wife  I think Thelma  Oh  Sounds like a great idea  For a fucking song  That would be real sentimental for me  Yesterday has been and gone  Tomorrow will I find the sun 
[02:15:00]  Or will it rain  Everybody's having fun  Except me I'm the lonely one  Doesn't really sound like Ozzy  That's great  Different sound  Can't argue with Jimmy anymore 
[02:15:30]  That's a good one  That's a lot of sentiment in this one  That's kind of a good one  I'll give you that  Tell you  Goodbye to all the fans  I guess that we'll meet  We'll meet in the end  Yeah  I kind of like  This probably isn't like the all time  No I know it's not the all time stuff  Something like Radiohead Creep 
[02:16:00]  Is like a good one  Yeah it's a great song  That's like a good kind of  You know  Yeah  I like it  Yeah  I love Radiohead  Yeah see that  We can agree on  One of the greatest albums ever  Is the Benz  Yeah  This isn't off  Wait  No this  This isn't off the Benz though  You're right  This is just a really good  Good song  Sounds good  It's got a great fucking voice  You ever hear the live version of this  Yeah  I've heard a few live versions of this 
[02:16:30]  At a few venues and stuff  Fuck  Guy just kicks ass doing this song  He has so many more of these type of songs in him  But he has to get all fucking experimental  I know  All weird and experimental  You're right  Which goes against some of  What I preach  La la la la la la  Yeah  Yeah  I'm a creep  Yeah  It's a good fucking song  You like this Radiohead 
[02:17:00]  It's a creep  You're so fucking special  Yeah  The real version  Nice  We're on satellite  That's right  But I'm a creep  That's in my guitar  That's fucking fantastic  Very good 
[02:17:30]  There you go  All right  You came up with one  Good shit  Get your little woozy inside  Yeah  That one's like  Yeah man  Why  Man  Because you can relate to it  What gets you going with that song?  Yeah because I'm a creep  I'm a weirdo  Yeah just kind of  You know like you know  When you were growing up  Were you like the creep  And the weirdo  No I really wasn't  I was kind of the funny guy  That everyone kind of liked  But you know  I  You know you kind of know people like that  And I think at some point  Everybody's in that situation 
[02:18:00]  No matter who you are  Yeah  But not even so much that  Just the way he sings it  And the music  The way it's put together  Kind of  Sometimes I can  Not even like a song  But there's a weird  Twisty neck harmony in it  Yeah  That gets you like  You know it really does  Odd things to me  And it has nothing to do  Go ahead  Call me a faggot  Call me a fruit  Whatever it is  Has nothing to do with  It's okay to show some emotion  The music  No no no  Because  Believe me  The faggy thing like that 
[02:18:30]  Alright  Will come out  But  A big ending  Of a  Big harmonic song  On Broadway  Where  Faggot  Exactly  It has nothing to do with  What the show is  Or anything  But that  Just voices  And the orchestra  Like this huge build  Of just harmonies  And then the way it goes  Bump  And then just stops like that  Yeah  It's like  Holy fuck 
[02:19:00]  That was  Amazing  Those fruits know what they're doing  On Broadway  Oh those faggots  They  They  You know  Every time I go to a musical  Which is literally  Once every  Fuck  I want to say  Every five years  It probably is longer than that  Yeah  You go  God damn  These catchy fucking songs  Yeah  You find yourself like  Itching to maybe buy the CD  On the way out  And I've never had  I've never bought the CD  I swear to God  I've never had  Because once you leave the theater  It's done  Wait a minute  Maybe I should 
[02:19:30]  Pick up this CD  Once you leave the theater  If you  If you get involved  In any way shape or form  After you walk out  That theater door  Right  You're right  I hate the people  That wear the Broadway  Like sweatshirts  And hats  Where are you going with that  What are you doing  I mean it's cool to wear  Your favorite team or something  But you're wearing like  A sweatshirt of your favorite  Broadway show  Yeah  I don't get that  It's just there's those weird  It's something weird  About the way they  Fucking sing on Broadway  I don't know  It's all power 
[02:20:00]  And then  Like when you get the chorus  And then the leads together  And  They're able to do that  Just fucking standing there  You know what  It really is  Pretty amazing  The last musical  I actually went to  I think it's considered a musical  And I was  I was pumping it  And it's leaving  Was Young Frankenstein  Had a bunch of  Very very catchy songs  Yeah  That  That damn thing was good  Yeah  I saw it because  They were advertising  On our show  I'm like alright  I'll sacrifice  I'll take the hit  I'll take the hit  We have to take the hit 
[02:20:30]  When you do a radio show  Every once in a while  You just gotta take the hit  Gotta go to something shitty  But I'm like  You know what  How bad can it be  So I went  I wasn't expecting much  And I was blown away  It was a great show  And the songs were  F-ing catchy  Dan from Long Island  Oh Dollar Bill  By Screaming Trees  Really?  Scott S. Quakertown  Is that a good one?  Love that fucking song  Can we get a little taste  Of Dollar Bill today?  Fucking Scott S.  I got a good obscure  Love song that makes me  Very happy  Yeah  She's Gone 
[02:21:00]  By Hall and Oates  Black Sabbath  Tough technical  I thought you meant  The real She's Gone  No that's 1976  She's Gone  She's Gone  Oh ah  Oh ah  It's probably older  Than Hall and Oates version  Listen to this  Dollar Bill  Perhaps  Listen to this  Just a little bit  Alright  His voice is haunted  Sounds like another song  Torn like an old  Dollar bill 
[02:21:30]  Mm-mm-mm  Girl, let them say  What they will  And no one should hurry up  That's all I seem to do  That no one should deserve you 
[02:22:00]  Eh, a little weird  That's all I seem to do  But I can see  Yeah  I'm just waiting for the hook  Yeah  He kicks it in  I gotta tell you  Goodbye  Mama  Quit taking this too far  It's hard to tell you  What's going on  Yeah  It's hard to make it easy 
[02:22:30]  On ya  It's hard to make it  Better make it easier  On ya  That's all I came to do  Oh  That's all I came  To do  Yeah, I forgot about that song  I forgot his fucking name  I should know his name  A lot of the boys in Seattle  Said he had the best voice  Out of all of them  Really?  And that he should have been  Bigger than he was 
[02:23:00]  Screaming Trees  You know, Nearly Lost You  Was their big hit  But  Yeah, Kurt had a couple  Of those songs though  That were really like  Wow, you know  Wow, well the  The song that gives me chills  Is Nirvana's  From the Unplugged  Yeah  Something in the Way  What?  Something in the Way  Is amazing  But  Yeah, it wasn't that one  The blues cover  Fucking  It's Lead Belly in the Pines  Where did you sleep last night  Yeah, yeah, yeah  That's a good one  That last scream he does  And opens his eyes  During the Unplugged  Fucking  I'll say it gives me chills 
[02:23:30]  And the fact that  Up and fucking down  Dan from Long Island  Has a good one too  Cause that  Let's go to Dan  That is kind of an eerie  Fucking song  That  Dan  Yo  Yo  Morning boys  Hey man  Uh, listen  Uh, what the hell is it  Mad World  Uh, not that faggot  Like Tears for Fears one  The one from Donnie Darko  Donnie Darko  Yeah, the version  That was in Donnie Darko  That's like  Yeah, this is kind of a  This is a good one  Let's get you going  A little bit  If you're gonna kill yourself 
[02:24:00]  To a song  That's probably it  All around me  Are familiar faces  Worn out places  Worn out faces  Bright and early  For their daily races  Going nowhere  You know what you do?  Have an iPod  Put these in  And just walk down the street  It's a fucking soundtrack  Really?  Dude, no shit  Give it a whirl  Nice 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, this song rolls  No expression  And, uh, take some drugs  Because that helps a lot  Mark Lannigan, thank you  Yeah, I wanna drown my soul  Screaming trees, lead singer  No tomorrow  No tomorrow  No tomorrow  And I find it kind of funny  I find it kind of sad  The dreams in which I'm dying  Are the best I've ever had  I find it hard to tell you 
[02:25:00]  I find it hard to take  When people run in circles  It's a very, very  Mad  And what, they used it in the commercial  For Gears of War or something?  Oh, did they really?  That was one of the best  Video game commercials ever  It just caught you every time  Yeah, it was pretty creepy  You're like, fuck, man  That's a great commercial  It's like end of the world shit happening  Yeah, yeah  That song's playing  That was a very cool 
[02:25:30]  Video game commercial  Other songs coming in  Jimmy the Creep from  XMFan.com  Oh, it updated too much  God damn it  Oh, wait, okay  Alice in Chains  Nutshell  Unplugged  Breaks my heart since he died  That's an amazing song  Kevin R from Beverly, Mass  Say hello to heaven  By Temple of the Dog  CW from Scranton  True up  He writes  Into the Mystic  By Van Morrison  Then he writes  No, I'm not 60 years old  You assholes  Van Morrison, man  Hey, the deep stuff  From Van Morrison  Is, uh, is eight 
[02:26:00]  Yeah  In my book  It's eight  When you get past  The dumb hits  What happened to the  They don't have that  Sabbath one  Well, they don't have it  They probably don't  It's a real  They might  Is it  Is this She's Gone?  Wow  Well, they don't have it  I think they'd have it  This is a real fucking  This is a real  Picker-upper  Real  The Aussie in the World of Warcraft  Commercials now  Yeah  The fuck  Crazy train  Jesus Christ, dude

[02:37:00]  Uh  Uh  Uh  Superstar  It's the cover of  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Um  The one  Karen Carpenter  Right  Huh  A Carpenter  Help me out  Somebody's saying  The Carpenters  Yeah  Hurt by Johnny Cash  I hurt my soul  That to me is trying too hard  To tug the heartstrings  Really  I don't  It does nothing for me  Wow  Yeah  I'm surprised  It just doesn't  That was to me  That was so consistent  With the way he was anyway 
[02:37:30]  I love Johnny Cash  I love Johnny Cash  Yeah  The wall  Dude I was talking about Johnny Cash  When you were out on the road  That you turned me on to like  The deeper stuff of uh  Johnny Cash  When we were tooling around  Yeah the fucking  During our break  This could be extremely gay  Superman?  Yeah  Oh that we were tooling around together?  No  Oh what?  This song?  This right here  This is awesome  Okay  Like how do you read to a Carpenter song?

[02:39:00]  It's a lot different than the car  Carpenter version  Yeah  Fuck yeah man  That's just odd  That's like serial killer chopping up a woman music too  You know  Cause the original  And your hack song through a thigh bone  Yeah the original's kinda like  And uplifting  And kinda sappy  Yeah  Very sappy  And this makes it  You're right  Like a serial killer song  Yeah  We should make a serial killer CD  Serial killer mix and tape  I'd put Hurt by Johnny Cash on there 
[02:39:30]  Yeah  I'd put that one on there  The Donnie Darko song  Oh absolutely  That would be on there  And then you could just like  That's three easy right there  What song do you choke her to  Or you know  Smother her to  Or beat her brains into  You gotta have one  And then one  One just to chop her up in the bathtub  One just wacky  Like stuck in the middle with you type song  Like  That little dance he does  Like it's horrifying  Horrendous dark music  But one just for the fun  One just  Locking up the body 
[02:40:00]  Just fun  What would be the fun song  On the serial killer mixtape  Oh wow  Serial killer mixtape  We need one fun song  Or else it'll all just be  Yeah  Very slow and  Uh  I don't know  Yes  Well Travis  Just reminded me  You have to have  Huey Lewis and the News on there  Oh that's true  Yeah but we're not going with  The ones that  I'll take what I'm giving  Cause I'm working for a living  But we're not  Dun dun dun  We're trying to go with ones  That haven't really been used  In movies or anything yet  Something happy 
[02:40:30]  Like just something like  Yeah  La la la la  Maybe an ABBA song  For some reason  Donka Shane  Just popped into my head  Donka Shane  Oh my god  Imagine beating  A woman's face  With a monkey wrench  While Donka Shane  Was playing  Donka Shane  Darling  Wham  Just  Disfiguring blows  To the face  The beauty was  In Clockwork  They did the great  Classical music  Oh yeah yeah 
[02:41:00]  Like to  To a gang fight  Yeah  And they're breaking  A glass across  The guy's face  And he cracks a bottle  Across the bridge  Of his nose  And it's this  Fucking beautiful  Classical music  Yeah  It's choreographed  It's so great  Something to say  Just get Big A's iPod  George and Philly  That song  Superstar  Uh huh  Is that creepier  Than Big A singing  Uh  Yeah  Big A singing  Has some comedy to it  That is why  He can't do it 
[02:41:30]  And make it sound  Why was that one  That really creeped me out  By Big A  Maybe we can find that  He rocks got the  Dash cabal  Him talking is creepy  Singing  Popcorn  Popcorn is a funny song  And there you are  Just fucking thrusting  A kitchen knife  Popcorn by  By  Don't look at your  Pal talk  I keep getting  Hocus Pocus by  Focus  Stuck in my head  Don't look  Popcorn  I can't tell you  What was it 
[02:42:00]  Hot butter  Oh  Boy  No it's not  From Orville  Redenbacher  Hot butter  A name like  Hot butter  And you put out  A song called  Popcorn  Don't you assume  That's the only  Song you're ever  Putting out  You pretty much  Pigeon hold yourself  Into that  Right  Unless you have a  Song called  Come Feels Like  Their follow  All pit  Salt  Hot butter  I mean where do you  Go after  Fucking popcorn  Like 
[02:42:30]  Soda  But the song is  Popcorn  Yeah  And the band's name is  I believe Hot Butter  Hot Butter  If I'm not mistaken  So you can't even  Do a song about any other  Maybe Lobster Tales  Right  That's pretty much  The only  The follow up  But I'm not sure  If the band  The band's called  Hot Butter  The song is Popcorn  Yeah  Alright so  If the band's named  Hot Butter  Then you got some  Hits on you  Yeah  Dude we'll name  Ourself Hot Butter  We'll do a song  Named Popcorn  Right  And then what  Slick  Yeah  Then what  Think about the future guy  The B side  Ass 
[02:43:00]  Lobster  I guess  Is the only other one  Yeah  Lobster Tales  What's some of those  Other things you put  Hot Butter on  Did you say popcorn  Baked potato  Garlic bread  Garlic bread  I don't know  Peas  Pancakes  Corn on a cob  See but it's different  If you take the butter off  And then put it on  Because it's cold  Right  It's got to be hot 
[02:43:30]  But already melted  And clarified  This song blows  Biscuits  Before you brown them  With a little paint brush  I was mistaken  The name of the band  Is according to  Reading from Whackbag  The band's name is  Hot Butter Saw  Hot Butter Saw  This thing stinks  What do you think  Happened to this band 
[02:44:00]  After this hit  Big A Intruder  Nothing  What was Intruder?  He's singing  Like a really creepy love song  What's Intruder though?  That's what it was labeled  Big A Intruder  I'm not sure  Big A Intruder  It's on the dilette?  Yeah  Alright let's listen  Eric just came in here  And set it up  Without going to Derek first  So Derek just 
[02:44:30]  Put his arms up  Like what are you talking about?  Why did you do it that way?  Why wouldn't you go in there?  Usually this is set up  Ahead of time  Because then you can go  And then you go right to it  Yeah  But now they got a look  And then you find it  Oh E-Rod  They got you doing  We don't even know  What this is  Go ahead  Can we play this on our show?  You know  Oh yeah  Something about  Opening windows and doors 
[02:45:00]  Oh  I love this  You know  How to move quietly  Creep across creaky wooden floors  Wow  I know  Where to find you sleeping  And I know that I can't score  Wow this is creepy  Slipping the clippers 
[02:45:30]  The clippers  Through the telephone wire  That's all we got on that  That's creepy though  That is really ghoulish  Too bad he can't carry a tune 
[02:46:00]  Like he can carry 800 pounds in gout  I kind of like that  He can't carry the tune  It makes it even creepier  Clippers  Through the telephone wire  Creepy  Alright we'll take a break  And get into some other shit  Look at that  General Motors is up 73 cents  Why?  And Ford is up 41 cents  They're kind of sounding like  They're gonna bail them out  Like now they're saying  Ah there's gonna be conditions  Like the fucking head muckety mucks  Might even have to step down  In a couple of instances 
[02:46:30]  Restructuring  A whole rethinking  Of how they run  Their businesses  Which is kind of weird  Because how's the government  Going to step in  And you know  Oversee that  And then  But it's kind of looking  More like they'll give them  Some cash  So that went up  That's good  Dow's up  And the Dow's way up  Because of that  246 around there  We might hit 9,000 again today  We're up 216 right now  Alright quick break 
[02:47:00]  And well we got our first  Christmas gift of the season  So we're gonna open it up  Live at our show  We're very picky  When it comes to our Christmas gifts  Goodies  Meaning that we don't get  Many Christmas gifts  No  Because people are scared  To like try to  Send in something  That we might like  Go ahead  Try to please us  I dare you  Yeah  We suck  Yeah try sending  A really expensive bottle  Of Cabernet  I dare you  Hope you'll look it up online  And see how much it costs  What a fuck  That's great 
[02:47:30]  I'll look it up  And go  Cheap shit  Apparently Steve from Bayshore  Went to piss.com  To get the wine  He left at Hope's Brothers  Steve gave me a talking toe  He goes  Dude  You do realize  That the wine was  Very good  And I did look it up  For real  And went  Fuck  No it wasn't  It was not good  Some newscaster  Fell out of the fucking thing  While she was making it  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  Ow  It was fucking  Awful 
[02:48:00]  It's like someone took the diapers  Of a cancer patient  And danced on them  And said here you go  Now put a cork in this  And give it to someone  Some wine  Yeah  Some sausage  Sausage  Some shit  And you give it to open a bottle  Terrible fucking gift  Steve from Bayshore  He probably went out to the Long Island Stown  And got an oil slick  In a fucking  A Paul Masson bottle  Fucking  Fucking  Elvis haired shit dick  Are you trying to say his wine stinks Jimmy 
[02:48:30]  Fucking awful  Oh wow  Stupid  He thought Thunderbird meant it was from the 50s  Like the car  He's taking a beating  He certainly is  Of course that  Fucking dopey jovial face  Fucking  Frankie Valley head  He really annoys him  Fucking awful  He's the only guy that has flammable wine  He can't die soon enough from his alcohol  Oh he's fucking terrible  He stinks  The guy's horrible 
[02:49:00]  He's a wonderful human  He got that wine from the stomach of a Roman soldier  After Peter O'Toole stabbed him on a sword  Fucking asshole  Fucking douche  By the way I do have to say that  And this is the truth  I should have invited Stephen S. from Bayshore to the wedding  But I got lazy near the end  Yeah  I was going through all my contacts  And then I just  I just  I got lazy  Like he should have made it  And that's about it  Earl is so  Fucking  Fuck Earl  He knows why he wasn't invited to the wedding 
[02:49:30]  Why wasn't he?  I don't want to even talk about it  Fuck him  Does it start with N?  No we had  We had a few there  Wait  Is there a real reason  Earl wasn't invited?  What?  There's a reason he wasn't?  Yeah  Blew me off as soon as he got the job with Ron and Fez  He was fucking calling me every other day before then  Oh  And it can't be because he was busy  Because  Something else  Something happened?  He knows  Really?  Was it something about skipping out on a check?  He knows  That's all I'll say for now 
[02:50:00]  Never pays a check that guy  I don't want to be a thing on the show to be honest with you  A little too late for that  Speculation's gonna fly now  Uh huh  By the way someone is writing  Will you guys accept homemade wine?  No  Fuck no  Fuck no  If the home is in a vineyard somewhere  Right  In France  Or the fucking Napa Valley  That's where you live fine  Right  Yeah  If it's like  If it's the Silver Oak family 
[02:50:30]  And they decide to maybe give you a little something  Before they start bottling it  Then yeah  I'll consider that homemade wine  Fuck no  Homemade wine stinks  I make it in my bathtub  He's got his asshole fucking  Sitting on the bottom of that bathtub for years  And decides now he's gonna make wine with it  That's how Stephen made yours in prison  In a fucking toilet  Yeah the toilet wine  Whatever it is they make in jail  You fucking  He get  The stuff that caretaker didn't drink  After he caught on fire from the bulb exploding  That's what Stephen gave you 
[02:51:00]  That toilet's real handy in prison  It's like the oven  An easy bake oven  You make wine in it  You can shit in it  All at the same time  You know who attempted to give me homemade wine  And I love the dude  I love the dude  And he was at the wedding  I didn't even attempt to try it  I think I passed it on to Danny  Who's that?  Because Danny will drink anything  No  Dr. Steve does the homemade wine  I just  I can't  After doing rectal exams  Squeezing the grapes with his fingers  He's got his finger in Tippy Tom's asshole 
[02:51:30]  Yeah  He's picking only the finest grapes by hand  Yes  They're roids  I mean  Let me see  Squeeze from the freshest prostates  His wine is called Suck Me  I mean if you have an imagination  It's S-U-K  That's suck  And then the M-A-I  Could be kind of may  Suck may  Hi may  A pinot  How do you know it's a pinot 
[02:52:00]  If you make homemade wine  You make it at home  It's just wine  It's just wine  When you make it at home  It's wine  Don't be cocky  And going  Oh this is a pinot  If you were making some beer  In your sink  You wouldn't be like  This is a pilsner  This is a wheat beer  Right  It's like  Nah it's just fucking  Like beer  And it could be the best  This could be it  He could be the next big thing  In the wine community  I don't even want to go down  The homemade wine route  Where do you get the grapes?  Yeah where do you get the grapes?  You can't just go to like  Wall bulbs  You can't go to food 
[02:52:30]  Key food  I'm sure they have some vineyards  And get wine grapes  He probably moistened the ones  He found in Raisin Bran  And made wine out of them  Fucking zilch  Dr. Mengele  Here's some wine  He listens  Jimmy  Good  Stop sending people  Fucking alcohol  That you stepped on  Your own awful  Corn ridden feet  He probably collects  Like cyst juice  Oh shit  When he has enough  He lets it ferment  Lance wine 
[02:53:00]  When people come in  Fucking boils Lance  He saves the pus  It's probably a cornucopia  Of juices  Blood  Yeah  A lot of fucking  Just tumor juice  Fucking  There's his head wound blood  Drains out that fucking box  That the sharps go in  In his office  They fucking put the needle  And snap it off in  When  When did fucking  Dr. Lucille Ball  Make the wine  Did he say when he did it  What year is it 
[02:53:30]  Oh Ricky  This is an 08  It's an 08  Wow  Yeah you gotta let it  Suck a little while  It's aged for  It's an oh yuck  Oh fuck  An 08 is not the year  It means August  Oh the vent  Fucking swill  Dr. Steve  It's awful  And it says  M-I-S-E  He's trying to get French here  M-I-S-E  New word  E-N  New word 
[02:54:00]  B-O-U-T-I-L-L-E-S  And it says  Use only as directed  Right  That means from my balls  In French  From my balls  You should at least make  Cialis wine or something  Fucking melt  Drink it down  And get a heart on  Something right  Fucking horrendous  Fuck you and your  Homemade wine  It's a wine slash salve  Right  Stinks  Who wants to try this  I'll try it  Who wants to give it a whirl  Alright open this fucking thing  Immediately 
[02:54:30]  Immediately  Doesn't even have a cork in it  Does it  Does it screw  Is it a screw top  It has some nice like  Corking  It is like corking  What does he do  Got like  Shit at home to do that  He probably took the cork  Out of a real wine  Stuck it in his  What is the cork  Is it real  Or is it one of those  Synthetic corks  Wow  That's way in there  Actually I know how he makes it  I shouldn't give it away  No  But he walks into the garage  And he fucking tips the lawnmower  And he puts that in the  Lawnmower gas tank  And he fucking  Puts a fancy label on it  Just drinking fuel 
[02:55:00]  He dumped  He dumped a little  Welch's grape soda in there  To give it that  Authentic wine flavoring  Grape soda  And fizz  Not even  Grape soda  Time to  Steve  Is a cunt  He does  It's the worst  I'd rather drink wine  From Dr. Kevorkian  Right  Fuck you and all your  Pills you send us  Go squirrel  Holy shit  Hammering him 
[02:55:30]  Him and fucking  Him and Steve  Steve the doctor  And Steve from Bayshore  Should get together  Like Thelma and Louise  And drive off a fucking cliff  Holy shit  Tie some grapes  To the bumper of the car  And when it hits the bottom  It'll fucking squish  And make a good wine  We don't want a corkscrew here  We don't want to drink  Your cancer juice  You fuck shit  It's terrible  But you hate it  Alright  Yeah we'll open it up  Here it goes  It's funny  It's awful  Oh you know this is gonna suck 
[02:56:00]  I know  Watch the whole bottle  Just fucking explain  You know what  I'm a wine connoisseur  Let me look at the bottom  Of the cork  Well it  Not much color there  I'm a wine connoisseur  It's a Pinot  I'm gonna be really honest  And Ant knows his wine too  Yeah  Yeah  A little bit  I've smelled worse  Yes  That's the best  I can do right now  Yeah  It smells like wine  You know something  I'm smelling something in this  That's vinegary  Yeah  I was gonna say that too  You know it's a great wine 
[02:56:30]  When the first word  In the name is Molotov  I just stuff a rag down there  And throw it at some  Palestinian  Oh that's fucking great  Drinking out of a paper cup  Is pretty good too I guess  It's not bad  I wouldn't drink it though  No  It tastes like bar wine  Like when you ask for a glass  Oh house wine  House wine I should say  It's like a little house wine  Yeah I didn't  Let me say that  It's not that bad  I would love to really kill them 
[02:57:00]  Uh huh  But I have expensive wine taste  It's got legs  Like Christopher Reeve  What do you think?  It's really not that bad  It's pretty thin  I mean it needs to sit for a while  But it's very thin  What do you think?  Yeah yeah  I think if that's sat for a while  Yeah it might  It wouldn't be too bad  I think if it's sat for a while  The colonies on Venus  Would enjoy it  If it's sat where  In a vat of real wine 
[02:57:30]  I should fucking sit  On the business end of a shotgun  Have a drink  He probably really fucked us up  And it's probably  A really nice French wine  And he just like  Pour it in there  And we're laughing at it  It's like a real expensive wine  How would you know in the end?  I'm not stupid  What do I know about wine?  It's a fancy French wine  Le dog m'air  M'air  Holy shit 
[02:58:00]  Wouldn't Chris in a raft with that?  If you couldn't  It would explode  The whole thing would just blow up  Dr. Steve does nothing but  He's nothing but nice to everybody  He's a terrific  I love Steve  And why?  Great  We get it  You want our attention  You got it  It's not an attention thing  He's a genuinely nice man  Him and his family 
[02:58:30]  Did you get a Christmas card for him  And everything?  Yes  I get it  We notice you  Hey by the way  You know what that wine's good for?  Save it until Easter  And then dump it on your eggs  I'd rather drink blood  From the basement  Of the Robert Reed collection  Poor Dr. Steve 
[02:59:00]  Here's a little from 78  The Macmillan years  Fine bouquet  Open up a wound  And pour it in  Shove the bottle up your ass  Into a headstand  You fucking queer  When you dump the wine out  It's just a clot  That falls in your glass  Oh the two of them  And they're fucking shitty wine 
[02:59:30]  Stop trying to be sophisticated  You dumb zeros  Wine is not supposed to have  An Exxon label on it  Both of you should be  Fucking shot with a shit gun  In the fucking mouth  Are you kidding?  You're both white trash  Stop trying to be  Part of society  Oh the nervous  Steve from Bayshore  He's not trying to  Translate Hitler videos  Or belting out Elvis songs  He's fucking a winemaker  Well he got his wine from 
[03:00:00]  I don't know  Somebody else  Oh that's right  He bought it  He didn't make it  I'm sorry Steve  At least he was smart enough  Not to actually make his own  In a fucking bathtub somewhere  Oh fuck  Hmm  Who knows where he got it though  Papamunaki  That's not wine  He overordered on Hyattine  How come my wine has a skull  And fucking crossbones on it  What does that mean? 
[03:00:30]  I didn't mean to imply  Steven from Bayshore made his  He's too lazy  Actually he's not lazy  He walks all the way to Rite Aid  Fucking grabs it off the shelf  I don't know  It's gotta be good  It's named after a woman  Miscarriage  You know it's not a good wine  It's called Port-au-Prince  It's got sewage in it  Fucking monkey toenails  I would say take your wine 
[03:01:00]  And shove it up your ass  But that would make it healthier  And more delicious  Holy shit  Beat it stupid  I haven't seen Dr. Steve  Take so much abuse  I hope right now  He's dumping his wine on himself  Like Pryor did  And then fucking lighting him  Yeah let's see if this shit lights  It's flammable  Of course it is  Save us when fuel goes back up  Beat it  Beat it  We don't need your wine 
[03:01:30]  Or your medical advice  Let's still get a life  Hey  The guy is very helpful  Stop riding our fucking coattails  Coattails?  His wine has a consistency of jam  No one's enjoying that  That's right  You have to rotate the bottle  So it doesn't harden  Your wine sucks  A pile of dicks  Drinking some  Drinking  Wait  I was trying to redo your line  I should just read it  Drinking some wine  La la la la  That fucked it up  What can I tell you  Alright 
[03:02:00]  It's a bottle of wine  W-H-I-N-E  I'd rather drink the fucking  Scrapings off of Big A's tongue  After E-Rock mashed him with his balls  Into a garlic mix  I'll take a sip of that  It's probably made from all the tears  That he shed  Wishing he had friends  I wouldn't just like that  You're crazy  And you know how you know  It's shitty wine  The fucking  Because the label  Is scotch taped  Onto the bottle  That's never the sign 
[03:02:30]  That it's a fucking  Classy operation  Scotch tape  Put a little of it  Good in a styrofoam bowl  That's good  It's not going anywhere  No wine won't light  It's only what at most  I never know  Well it's trying though  No it's gotta be what  14, 15 or 16% at most  It was trying  14% alcohol  Yeah  Look at that color  That's not the color of wine  Let me see what color is it  It looks like fruit punch  That's fucking horrendous  It's a pinot  It's a pinot 
[03:03:00]  It's not as deep a red  A pinot?  Yeah  Penis green  That's fucking really awful  Let me see what color that is  That's not adult wine red  No  It's fucking awful  Looks like Robitussin  It's just great wine  It gets you drunk  And you don't cough anymore  It doesn't taste as good  Of course it doesn't  I'd rather drink Robitussin  With a fucking little piece of ice  In a glass  Out of a bedpan  Cling  I'd rather drink out of 
[03:03:30]  Sonny von Bulo's  Dead cunt  Than a fucking bottle  Of his swill  Stick to the doctoring  You zilp  Oh  What a  Fucking horrendous  Now make it up to us  And send us some real wine  From a real vineyard  You know  Bonnie Blakely ordered  A bottle of this  And that's why  Fucking Robert shot her  Better put some doctor sayings  On there  Like open and say

[03:04:30]  And then there's a little warning  Do not spill on the car  Or the paint will come off  Fucking awful  His Pepsi wine  He should have been like  Steve from Bayshore  And pulled four dollars  Out of his pocket  And bought a case  Fucking  Like to fucking  Cut that 50s hairdo  With a hatchet  Fuck you  Bowser  Stupid shitty homemade wine  You're not fooling anyone  It's really good 
[03:05:00]  Is it  Two of them should be  Fucking clumped  Wow  Oh what a hammering  Just for being nice  Sending a bottle of wine  See  Yeah  That's why we get  So many presents  Being nice  It didn't even come in a box  It was a bottle of wine  With a fragile label  Tape to it  The dress written on the label  The UPS driver  Stinks  Awful  I'd rather drink  Out of a bottle  That floats to the beach  From the ocean  With a fucking help note in it

[03:12:00]  Yeah  I want to say this much  Carolines is an amazing comedy club  I don't want to confuse the issue here  Because we might have to kill them  Because most times  We get shit from people  But I do want to say  Their comedy club rules  Yep  Greg Charles  Completely took care of me  When I saw Bill Burr  And Joe DeRosa this weekend  Dude he takes care of us  It's ridiculous  Whenever we go down there  Treated like royalty  Absolutely  He runs a good club  And  His past record of gifts  Has been phenomenal 
[03:12:30]  Yeah  Yes  I don't think this came from him  Well  I'm just saying  From  Anytime we've gotten anything  From Carolines  Send her  Caroline  Herself  Oh  Yes  The big dog  We've always gotten  Great gifts from Carolines  The best Christmas gift  We ever got  Was from a comedy club  That's no longer around  The Louis XIII  Holy shit  Yeah  I still got that  I still got it  But unfortunately  In my old apartment

[03:40:00]  alright, but I know they were  we were promoting the hell out of their DVD last week  yes  I had no desire to see the movie  now I gotta see it  they said it was hilarious  that shit's hilarious  did you see Step Brothers?  no  did you, Danny?  no, actually  I don't go to the movies  I'm privileged  yeah  I just miss them until they come on cable  yeah  alright  what are we sponsoring  something we're not doing today?  well, they switched it up on us  on Webex?  Step Brothers, I'm pretty sure it's Webex again 
[03:40:30]  alright, Lime of the Day  we beaks  well, it's not Lime of the Day  now I think I'm wrong  Lime of the Day is, you know, resting  yeah  oh, wait, we have time to kill?  no  yes, we do  we have time to kill  but I don't think we do  I think it's  I get to play this until he comes back  we go  oh, no  ah  it's feeling pretty good  la, la, la, la  taking my time on the la, la, la, la 
[03:41:00]  snow falling down in the la, la, la, la  everybody's singing like la, la, la, la  taking all our heart with the la, la, la, la  making my way to the la, la, la, la  Oh, Danny's back.  Fuck, man.  I was just getting into that.  Were you?  By the way, I'm taking this copy of this song home with me. 
[03:41:30]  I'm going to mail it off to some of my radio buddies.  We're making this a hit, boys and girls.  Please lose it.  I know Ronnie B's already way on it, but I'm going to help as much as I can.  What do we got?  Line of the day or what did we learn as much by Webex?  Well, I'm thinking it's Webex because what happened was we switched sponsors for last  week and then no one ever got back to me on what, if it's reverting back to old copy  or if there's supposed to be new copies.  So I think we might be giving a free plug away.  Whatever it is, it is now. 
[03:42:00]  Let's get out of here.  Kurt Cobain doing Where Did You Sleep Last Night, an old Lead Belly song.  It's probably one of my favorite fucking songs of all time, to be honest with you.  Yeah, it is a good one.  It's easily the best thing I ever heard Kurt Cobain do.  Close second is Something in the Way, maybe?  That's tough.  It's all pretty tough, especially from that album.  I'm trying to think what else I really, really like.  Penny Royalty.  Penny Royalty.  That's a good one. 
[03:42:30]  Now you're talking.  That's a great fucking Nirvana song.  Now you're talking.  I like all the Meat Puppets covers they did with them on that Unplugged.  What about the Vaseline song?  What the hell was that called again?  That's a STP.  Oh.  And that's confirmed.  That is.  All right.  WebEx.com.  Thanks.  Hold meetings.  Make presentations.

[03:44:00]  When the sun don't ever shine  I would shiver the whole night through  The husband was a hard-working man  Just about a mile from here  His head was found in a drive wheel

[03:46:00]  My girl, my girl  My girl, my girl  Don't lie to me  Tell me when did you sleep last night  In the pines, in the pines  In the pines, in the pines  Where the sun don't ever shine  I would shiver the whole night through  My girl, my girl  My girl, my girl  Where will you go  My girl, my girl 
[03:46:30]  My girl, my girl  Where will you go  I'm going where the cold wind blows  In the pines, in the pines  The sun will shine  Shine the shiver  Shine the shiver  Oh  Oh  Oh  Night through  Through
