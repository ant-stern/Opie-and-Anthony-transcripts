<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often shifting rapidly between segments.  It began with Thanksgiving preparations, including humorous complaints about the logistics of bringing cheese and crackers to a family gathering, and anxieties about travel given the weather.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Jimmy Norton and later Colin Quinn, also reviewed the documentary "Burn," about the Detroit Fire Department, and several viral music videos by a black producer featuring young children, offering highly critical and vulgar commentary on their sexually suggestive nature.  They discussed Alec Baldwin's firing from MSNBC, referencing Joan Rivers' opinions.  The Stooges' "Give Me Danger" was played.

The show then transitioned to personal anecdotes, with Opie detailing a child's potential measles case requiring aggressive double-parking for a doctor's visit, and Anthony discussing a child's nighttime crying. This segment heavily featured a heated on-air confrontation between Sway and Kanye West, with the hosts and Colin Quinn using offensive terms ("asshole," "twat," "brat," "cunt") to describe Kanye's behavior.  They analyzed Kanye's personality and its impact on his business ventures, especially his sneaker designs ("Red Octobers") and dealings with Nike, playing a clip of the argument.  The mystery of missing donuts brought to the studio by Bobo led to humorous accusations, and Sal's absence, initially attributed to illness, was jokingly linked to a condom ("Magnum") purchase and a clandestine encounter.

A discussion about a disastrous date segued into extensive road trip planning, including visits to locations with suggestive names (like Intercourse, Pennsylvania), abandoned Detroit buildings, and quirky roadside attractions.  The hosts and Bobo brainstormed comedic content, such as milking a cow at an Amish community and eating at a notoriously rude restaurant.  A lengthy, rambling call from Lady Di, filled with incoherent commentary about her drinking, joblessness, and Thanksgiving plans, dominated the segment, prompting crude jokes from the hosts and Bobo.  Colin Quinn remained in studio during this segment.

A chaotic segment followed, starting with a poker game anecdote involving Joe Cumi and Carl.  Magician Eric Goldfarb was then introduced as a guest, and a pre-recorded, extremely graphic and sexually explicit video dating profile of Daniel "Bobo" Curlin was played. Goldfarb performed magic tricks for Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, Colin Quinn (promoting his show "Unconstitutional"), and Bob Kelly, with Bobo's reactions providing considerable humor.  Goldfarb promoted his website, GoldfarbMagic.com.  Discussion continued about Jim Norton's and Bob Kelly's upcoming shows, and Bobo's dog, Mr. Maloonigan.

The show concluded with a segment focusing on the conflict between personal expression and professional responsibilities. A caller, Jim, discussed the backlash from criticizing a reality show sponsor.  The hosts offered advice on balancing authenticity and financial stability.  Other callers shared personal issues: grief (Rusty, relating to the death of Patrice O'Neal), relationship problems (a friend cutting contact after an engagement, a child from a past relationship, and a long-distance casual relationship), and a caller's confession of stealing Vicodin.  The show ended with advertisements for Steven Singer Jewelers, Bob Kelly's stand-up show, and Jim Norton's SiriusXM show.  Throughout the final segment, the hosts and callers used vulgar and offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, yo, what's up out there?  How's the show?  How can I sit?  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  If someone finds this offensive, just don't listen.  But my guess is, you'll be sitting around.  Let's do this.  It's going down jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:00:30]  This is good radio right here.  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular radio shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted, I'm telling you.  Who's enjoying this shit?  That's what you like, isn't it?  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies. 
[00:01:00]  Just remember that.  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, it would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Green this over, kind of hard.  Oh!  Kind of hard.  Oh!  Oh!  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  It's Thanksgiving!  Oh!  Oh!  Wow!  Yay!  It's time!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  It's Thanksgiving!  We, we, we, we are gonna have a shot!  What are you gonna eat?  I like the turkey, ay, mashed potatoes, ay, we, we, we are gonna have a shot!  I like the turkey, ay, mashed potatoes, ay, it's Thanksgiving!  It's Thanksgiving! 
[00:02:00]  All right!  We're live, yes.  Yes!  What the fuck are we here?  We, uh, we came in.  Yes, we did.  Anyone else?  Probably not.  I have probably not.  Yeah, what about, uh, the mashup?  Are they here?  Ah, I don't think so.  Uh-huh.  What about, uh...  I don't think so.  What about, uh, the king of, uh, whatever?  No?  The part-timer?  Uh, of course he's not here.  What about...  Thanksgiving!  Thanksgiving!  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! 
[00:02:30]  We, we, we are gonna have a good time!  We certainly are.  We'll fucking regardless.  Oh, I like that.  Yeah, yeah, that was fun coming in today, I gotta...  Oh, my God, the rain is, uh, pretty brutal, huh?  It's, uh, yeah, they, they, they were making it sound like it was, um, a snowstorm, like  they were covering it last night, yesterday and everything, like there was this big snowstorm  coming.  Uh, I don't know why they do that.  It's rainy, it's windy, it sucks, but it, it didn't merit all the attention the news was 
[00:03:00]  giving it yesterday.  Oh, I don't know about that.  Yeah?  I'm gonna have to disagree for once.  Oh, shit.  Just because...  I'm gonna have to disagree with your police work there, Lou.  Just because it was, uh, it's the busiest, uh, travel day of the year when this is hit.  That's true.  If this was just a regular fucking day, who gives a fuck?  Yeah, they...  But the winds are, like, 40 or 50 miles an hour, too.  What are you talking about?  Yeah.  Well, I was driving in...  The rain is, like, coming sideways.  But I'm driving in, and it sucked, there was a lot of traffic, but I noticed, like, if you 
[00:03:30]  just drive normal, it's not gonna fucking hurt you.  Well, a lot of panicky Pete's, they decided to get out of New York City yesterday.  The traffic around Manhattan was really ridiculous.  Are you saying yesterday might have been getaway day?  Well, today is still getaway day, but a lot of people decided to get the jump on it.  Oh, let's get the jump on it.  And a lot of flights have been canceled, so they decided to drive.  A lot of people driving miserably through this shit right now just to see their shitty 
[00:04:00]  families.  That's how festive.  Oh, oh, oh.  Give me that again, please.  Thanks, Steve, your shitty families.  Yay!  Enjoy your shitty families, people.  Yes.  Are you excited about all the drama you're gonna talk about around the Thanksgiving...  It will be nice, right?  Dinner.  I'm going over Aunt Fran and Uncle Tony's house, which used to be called Grandma's house. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, boy.  I know.  It used to be Grandma's house.  Did they hose it down and just move on?  That's pretty much it.  Really?  Hose it down.  Hose it down and keep it in the family.  And then after a few years...  Because a few years after she died, you were still like, oh, we're going to have Grandma's  for Thanksgiving and stuff.  And then it turned into, oh, we're going to have a...  Right.  Hey, I'm Fran and Uncle Tony.  Oh, we're going to have a great...  Ah, that's right.  No one escapes it.  Eventually, people won't even know you lived. 
[00:05:00]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to my brother's and I asked him the very simple question.  Oh.  What can I bring?  The what can I bring question.  That is a...  And he gives me the worst thing to bring.  Uh-oh.  Cheese and crackers.  Cheesy crackers.  Mm-mm.  Do I have to cut up the cheese or can I just bring blocks of cheese?  Because I got to pack up two kids right after the radio show and go for a really long drive.  And he wants me to bring cheese and crackers. 
[00:05:30]  Let me tell you something.  They make this...  What happened to just, I don't know, a couple bottles of wine or a pie?  I hear you.  You go to a supermarket, any supermarket, they make the cheesy cracker platters.  Yeah, but...  You just grab one of those or two of those.  They're great.  But they know we make money, so, you know...  Oh, they expect better...  They expect better cheese.  Well, they don't expect you to sit there and start fucking slicing your own goddamn cheese.  Well, we got blocks of cheese.  Oh, God.  So I'm just gonna go, here's your cheese.  Thud.  Here's your crackers. 
[00:06:00]  Crunch.  Let's get it on!  Yeah.  They do make...  What are we gossiping about?  They got some pre-sliced cheddar.  Yeah?  Oh, I get some of that.  And then I put...  I get some of that very rare sliced roast beef.  Nice.  And you put that on a cracker.  Sure.  Holy Jesus Christ.  It's like you're at some fancy cotillion.  You throw out some green olives?  Some olives?  No.  Grape olives?  Not a big fan of the olive.  No?  Yeah.  That's too bad.  A ginkgo olive oil. 
[00:06:30]  No.  Thanksgiving.  Holy shit.  What the fuck is this about?  Haven't we done this Thanksgiving thing already?  A few times, probably.  I bet.  I bet more than once.  Are you like me?  You go to the same house, sit in the same seat, and have the same exact conversations?  The only thing that's different is that you see your nieces and nephews, like...  A little bigger.  A little bigger.  But everything else is exactly the same.  The food's exactly the same.  Yes.  It is Groundhog Day for me. 
[00:07:00]  And I don't know how you change that up.  Yeah, you can't.  Because it's still a really nice presentation.  The food is excellent.  With a mass shooting, maybe.  A mass shooting would help.  But, yeah...  I don't know how you mix that shit up, but...  It's the same...  Exact.  The same entrance.  Exact.  You say hello to the same people the same way, and you have the same little comments.  I swear if you videotaped it, you'd be amazed how almost exact it is.  Right down to the conversations. 
[00:07:30]  You get your beverage.  Same wine.  Same beverages.  Everyone's sitting in the same seat.  Might mix it up a little.  There might be one person that's sitting a little different, but for the most part, it's...  You're right.  You're right.  And you realize no one really has much going on with their lives as well.  No.  It's the same shit.  Hey, what's new?  Ah, same old shit.  What's new with you?  What are you up to?  Nah, heh.  Ah, so who's playing on the TV?  Ah, what do we got?  What football game? 
[00:08:00]  Ah, so what have you been up to?  Ah, not much.  Yeah.  It's been a year.  I know.  Hmm.  Yeah, you're absolutely right, but you know, I guess you just gotta go through the motions.  Nah, it's fine.  It'll be alright.  Make everyone happy.  It'll be alright.  Hey, you wanna throw the football around a little bit on the...  Oh, it's a little too cold and windy out.  A little rainy.  I don't think so.  Thanksgiving!  I usually sit there watching whatever somebody is putting on TV.  It's usually a mix-up of football games and various television shows. 
[00:08:30]  Some horrible holiday movie.  Yeah, stuff like that.  What are the big holiday movies for Thanksgiving?  Thanksgiving.  What are they usually?  It's usually like Christmas stuff.  What do you got, Yurok?  You know.  Planes, trains, and automobiles.  Oh.  What?  That's become a staple of Thanksgiving?  Yeah, that is Dutch.  If you ever...  Dutch?  No, I'm talking about the stuff that's on TV.  What the hell are you talking about?  It's not a classic.  Yes, it is.  It's not a Thanksgiving classic.  It's full shit.  What's Dutch?  Why do people call in?  I like Dutch, but it's not... 
[00:09:00]  It's a good movie.  I don't even know Dutch.  What's Dutch?  Ed O'Neill.  Yeah, I don't know it.  I don't think I know it.  And it's on TV every year?  Yeah.  No.  No.  Marching like the wooden soldiers or something.  That's like a Christmassy thing, right?  I'm talking about this channel.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  It's channel 11.  It's channel 11.  Back me up.  It's night stuff.  They play that every fucking year for whatever reason.  It's true.  They don't play Dutch on TV, I don't think.  No.  Wizard of Oz?  Wizard of Oz?  Yeah, that's what I'm getting at.  The shit they throw on because it's Thanksgiving. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  March of the Toy, Wooden Soldier things.  March of the Wooden Soldiers.  Oh, no one...  Yeah.  I think Christmas shows have become Thanksgiving shows.  No one was on, I think, last night.  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.  Oh.  And we just so happened to buy a classic DVD set of holiday favorites.  You get the Frosty.  The four-pack, yeah.  And then you get the second Frosty, which is weird.  The old Rankin Bass fucking specials.  Then you get the Rudolph, and then you get... 
[00:10:00]  The Jack Frost one, right?  The Little Drummer Boy.  Oh, yeah.  All that shit.  Anyway, we put Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer on on the way back from Philly.  That thing stinks.  The TV edit's really good.  Yeah.  But that is an hour long.  It's an hour long.  Hour long on the DVD.  When they play it on TV, I do believe they'd squeeze it into a quick, you know, 20 minutes.  What are they cut out?  Well, I'd have to go through the whole thing again, but it is really long. 
[00:10:30]  Vomitable Snowman?  He's in there.  Fucking Chris Kringle?  The weird dentist kid is in there.  Yukon Cornelius?  Yeah, he's in there.  We're not going to listen to Alice's Restaurant.  Oh, maybe.  Maybe we will today.  Oh, God.  Have we ever broken down that song?  Maybe we could do it today.  That's when I saw Alice, and she was in the restaurant.  Shut up.  Exactly.  So, I'm a day behind Anthony, but I saw Burn, Dennis Leary's documentary. 
[00:11:00]  Yes.  Holy fuck, if you love documentaries.  I love documentaries myself.  It's done very well.  Fantastic.  Yeah.  What's his name that he works there?  Serpico.  Jim Serpico.  We used to have meetings with him, remember?  Back in the day?  They were trying to figure out what to do with us.  I remember that.  Like every other TV outlet, they just couldn't figure it out.  Um, it's sort of a mix between Jackass and Mythbusters with a little fucking Perry Mason thrown in. 
[00:11:30]  They absolutely loved us on our radio show back in the day.  They just couldn't figure out what to do with it.  Can't figure it out.  Yeah, we took a lot of those meetings over the years.  But anyway, Serpico and Leary, they're a great combo.  They went up to Detroit.  They know their shit about the fire department.  And they followed the fire department around for a year.  And wow, this thing is well shot.  Like Ann said yesterday, it's...  It's like a rock video sometimes. 
[00:12:00]  Beautifully shot.  Yeah.  And the music they use is perfect.  And the stories they got out of these guys, wow.  A lot of drama, action, and yeah, personal stories.  Right.  Did you see that poor handicapped guy?  The guy that got fucking smashed with the bricks and paralyzed.  He's in a wheelchair and his hot fucking wife.  Hot wife putting his pants on for him.  Oh, do you see the tits on her?  I'm sorry, dude.  If you do happen to bypass by the station.  He could still have sex, though. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Because they're going to try to have a kid.  But I mean, wow.  Do you feel the sex, though?  I don't know.  Maybe he has to artificially inseminate.  No, supposedly you still get the boners.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Because we saw that in that other...  Oh, what the...  The roller fucking wheelchair ball.  Oh, right, right, right.  Murder ball, I think it was called.  Another great documentary.  My God.  And they talked about how those guys still get boners.  Maybe.  I don't know.  Definitely you still get the boners, because your brain's working, I guess. 
[00:13:00]  Jeez.  Well, obviously your brain's working.  But I mean, that part of the brain that gets the boners going still works.  But yeah.  Yeah, the scars up his back.  They're showing all the operations he's had to have.  Horrible story.  Physical therapy, yeah.  When he goes through all the things they used to do...  Oh, I know.  Terrible.  And then, like, he has...  I was thinking about that guy literally when I woke up this morning, because I had one  of those horrendous, fucked up, I just murdered a million people dreams, and then woke up  and realized it was just a dream.  Oh, you're out of trouble. 
[00:13:30]  And I'm telling you right now, this is the greatest day of my life.  Yeah, yeah.  Because it's not real.  Yes.  I was sweating and everything.  Oh, it's like, what am I going to do?  I'm going to go to prison.  It was so real.  Oh, this sucks.  And then I woke up and went, oh my God, that was a dream.  I'm out of trouble.  How great is that?  That's instant.  But, with that said, this guy has the opposite shit.  Oh, God, right.  Every night in his dreams, he's probably still snowboarding and going on vacation with his  hot wife and riding his motorcycle and all this shit. 
[00:14:00]  And then he wakes up and he even says it in the documentary, for a split second, he thinks  he's not paralyzed as he's waking up and realizes, oh, fuck, that's right, this is my reality.  Oh, that's terrible.  Horrible, right?  Yeah.  And that's part of the documentary, like there's a bunch of other stuff, yeah.  Yeah, I don't want to give too much away.  Yeah, yeah.  But it just shows how fucked they are in Detroit.  Oh, my God.  What's amazing to me is the numbers.  In 1950, Detroit had 1.8 million people. 
[00:14:30]  In 2010, I guess that was the last official census.  Yeah.  They were down to 700,000.  They lost 1.1 million people.  Yes.  And that's why there's 80,000 abandoned buildings up there.  80,000.  80,000.  Crazy.  And they're just being lit on fire and catching on fire.  Amazing.  And this fire department that has zero resources, zero money.  Well, the whole city has zero resources for anything.  They don't even have, I don't, supposedly they don't really even have city buses anymore. 
[00:15:00]  Or just a handful at this point.  There's no resources for the people up there.  Yeah.  And then you get the fire commissioner coming in from L.A., like you said.  Oh, boy.  He's going to shake things up.  Oh, God.  I was feeling for the fireman because I think we all can relate, no matter what you do for  a living.  Right.  You get the new boss that comes in and goes, I need more from you guys, but I can't give  you more money, no raises, and no resources. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Now do better.  Now do better.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  Yeah, that was fucking crazy.  The city of Detroit cut the wheelchair guy's benefits?  What is that?  Did they?  What?  Let me say hi to Kyle in Indiana.  Kyle.  Hey, hey.  Yeah, hey.  How you doing?  All right, buddy.  Yeah, I just saw him.  I'm a firefighter here in Indianapolis, and they have an FDIC here every year at the big  firefighter convention.  And the guys came, and they had a city that's actually cutting his benefits. 
[00:16:00]  They're only going to give him $200 a month.  What?  Yeah.  You can't live on that.  That's horrible.  Yeah, a guy will never be able to function properly.  Oh, my God.  Well, because he explains, I think we give this, I mean, this is obvious shit, so, but  he basically said, you know, these guys don't make a lot of money, so they all had side  jobs.  Yeah.  And this guy was really good at roofing and flooring and all that type of stuff, and obviously  he can't do it because he's paralyzed.  Yeah.  So he can't make that side money like the rest of the guys can. 
[00:16:30]  Terrible.  So.  All right, Kyle.  Yeah, thanks a lot.  Have a good day.  Yeah, you too, buddy.  God, they cut his benefits.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  Holy shit.  Bunch of fuckwads.  But the movie's on Netflix?  Yes.  Is it just a Netflix movie?  Um, no.  I think it's on iTunes.  Yeah, iTunes.  No, I mean, is it in theaters?  Is it old school?  I don't think it's in theaters.  That's because, that's, that's starting to become old school, going to an actual fucking 
[00:17:00]  movie theater.  I know, right?  Yeah.  It's only for the big fucking movies.  Right.  The big blank busters.  Right.  Like Hunger Games things.  True.  Yeah.  Jason in Detroit, the buses are constantly running late and the drivers get beat up by angry  passengers.  It's like, it's like the road warrior.  Holy shit.  It's Thunderdome.  And, you know, I, I, there's no way that city comes around.  There's no way. 
[00:17:30]  No, that's, it's got to be buried over and something new has to come out of it.  Well, you know, a much smaller type of city, obviously.  But man, when they were doing those shots, just, did you see the one shot with all the  factories that were fucking abandoned?  Yeah.  It was like a, it was like a helicopter shot and from above it, it was just unbelievable.  Yeah, they're done.  There is no way to bring that back without some new fucking industry going in there. 
[00:18:00]  And still, you'd have to plow under everything that's there already and build something new  out of it slowly.  It's like the Sim game again.  Right.  When your city goes to shit in Sim City, you know, you've got to blast and knock down  and, and bulldoze over the old shit and start fresh again.  But you need, you need some kind of industry to get the money pumping into the area.  Yes, you do.  This guy wants to make another point about the documentary.  Oh, does he?  We're trying not to give away spoilers because there's a lot of great storylines in this 
[00:18:30]  damn thing.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Devin.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hey, um, first off, Opie, Anthony, huge fans.  You guys are fucking fantastic.  Of course we are.  Yeah.  But, uh, nonetheless, uh, I'm sitting here listening to a friend who's been listening to you guys  much longer than I have.  And he was mentioning that, I guess, the first time that you, Anthony, met Dennis Leary,  he was kind of a dick or something.  Yes, he blew me off.  He blew me off.  Yeah.  We got past that, though.  I, I, I, how dare me? 
[00:19:00]  How dare me?  I went to try to, uh, greet him and shake his hand at an event that was going on.  In Boston.  Without, uh, Adam Farrar as my intermediary.  I jumped the gun because Adam was going to introduce me.  He was doing the, the show, The Job with him at the time.  And, um, and I, I went to shake his hand at the bar, uh, without Adam there.  Because we, I, we went up to get a drink.  Leary went next to me in the bar and I was like, hey, how you doing?  Uh, Anthony, Opie, Anthony.  And he didn't look at me, he just kind of stuck his hand out a little and went, hey, 
[00:19:30]  how you doing?  And that was it.  That was it.  And I walked away and everybody was watching and, and laughed at me.  Wow.  Okay.  Yeah.  The guy's laughing in the background.  Yeah.  It was, it was pretty bad.  I've, I've heard that, that Dennis Leary is just a fucking asshole.  Nah, he's a great guy.  Honestly, I got to defend him.  Since then, he's been nothing but, uh, great to us.  He's a good guy.  I can only imagine how many people come up to him. 
[00:20:00]  But that night, it was hilarious because there was a whole bunch of us watching Anthony,  like, approach Dennis Leary.  And when he got blown off, we kind of all turned around.  We felt so uncomfortable.  Oh, it was very uncomfortable.  Oh, man.  It was very uncomfortable.  All right, Devin.  Thank you, brother.  Let me go to Sean in Ohio.  Sean.  Hey, that guy that called about the benefit, he's full of shit.  Oh.  Toronto!  Oh, damn. 
[00:20:30]  They're ruining the bit.  I don't think.  We like when the bit is real.  When it's organic.  Right.  Yes, yes, indeed.  Uh, why would anyone put money back into Detroit with the unions driving everything into  the ground?  Well, that's true.  A lot of, some people have, uh, blamed the unions up there.  Yeah.  In Detroit.  I think it's a much bigger fucking problem than just a...  I don't think it's any single problem, you know?  There's a combination of things that's taken to, um, to destroy a city of that size, yeah.  And the city, uh, they've decided to what? 
[00:21:00]  Try to take down 3,000 abandoned, you know, structures.  Yeah, a year.  Not just homes, uh, structures, a year.  That's their schedule.  That would take 25 years to get rid of the 80,000 abandoned buildings.  Right.  More than 25, obviously, if you want to do accurate math.  Yeah, yeah.  But in that mean, in the meantime, more buildings are going to become abandoned.  Right.  So how do you keep up with that?  Yeah.  And then the philosophy, one more thing about the movie, then we can move on.  Yeah.  The philosophy of let it burn.  Uh-huh. 
[00:21:30]  That drives a fireman crazy, I guess.  That's what I was saying yesterday.  It's like, they are born to put fires out of these firemen.  They love it.  And to get an order from your superiors to sit there and watch the structure burn.  Right.  You know, they're chomping at the bit, as they say, to get in there and put it out.  Let it burn.  Yeah.  That's got to be tough for those guys.  Yeah.  If it's determined no one's in the house.  Yeah.  And it's an abandoned shitty, you know, there's no good use for this structure anymore. 
[00:22:00]  You know, they're being told to just let it burn.  Which I think is kind of smart.  There is a reason.  I mean, it makes sense to a certain extent.  But these firemen, they don't think like that.  Right.  Let me say hi to Nick in Michigan.  Nick.  Hey.  Hey, what's up, man?  What's up?  I work at the Renaissance Center.  And like you were saying, all the bus stations and stops are going down.  And it's ridiculous because GM, like, they have their own, like, private shuttle service 
[00:22:30]  now because, like, you can't even get to and from work because either you're going  to get the shit kicked out of you or mugged or it's ridiculous.  I mean, you literally can't do anything but, you know, try to find your own private service.  Or you can't even take a taxi because there's, like, not taxi.  Private bus service.  So you can get to work because there's no buses.  Amazing.  Yeah, it's pretty awesome.  I mean, I've been mugged twice and I've worked at GM.  Oh, congrats. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Where are you getting mugged?  There's, like, you have to pay, like, ten bucks to park in, like, a private parking structure.  Yeah.  You didn't want to pay?  And you just walk out.  Yeah.  And you think, like, it's one of, like, the homeboys just trying to, you know, panhandle  for some change.  And then which way is north or what time is it?  And there you go.  Yeah.  Get the old wall.  Get the old knife to the neck.  Jesus Christ.  So why do you stay there?  You have no choice?  No.  No.  I live in, like, white suburbia. 
[00:23:30]  I have to commute, like, 45 minutes south.  Jesus.  And they just know, you know, who the white people are with the money, you know.  Just go on a Land Rover like a safari.  Right.  That's fucking...  That's crazy.  Horrible.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a pain in the ass, and it's dangerous.  But, unfortunately, GM's one of the best running gigs in Michigan, so...  All right.  They're still cranking out some vehicles, I guess.  Thank you, brother.  Yep.  Thanks, man.  So the documentary's called Burn.  It's on Netflix.  Yeah.  Good one. 
[00:24:00]  iTunes and everywhere else.  I do enjoy a good documentary, I gotta tell you.  Oh, absolutely.  It's gotta be, like, one of my favorite things.  You just sit there and watch a good documentary.  I need a new one.  Done well.  Interesting subject.  Yeah.  I need a new documentary.  Because a bad documentary is just like, oh, God.  Honestly...  Boring.  Even the bad ones are pretty good.  I know.  There's always something you can garner from it, but...  A slow-moving one or boring one?  There was a really bad one on HBO. 
[00:24:30]  I mentioned it briefly a couple weeks ago on the people that, you know, collect cans in  New York City.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a bad documentary.  They could have done so much more with this thing.  But it was still fascinating.  Yeah, I guess.  To just watch it.  All these people that rely on just collecting cans all day long.  I don't know if the people have these guys in their cities, but you get these guys that  they have a mountain of empties in front of them.  And the shopping carts are just overflowed with the giant bags. 
[00:25:00]  It looks like the Grinch.  Yeah, yeah.  The Grinch's sleigh.  The Grinch's sleigh, but filled with empties.  Yeah.  So, I like that one, man.  It wasn't that great.  Yeah.  It's kind of hard to fuck them up, but...  If they're boring.  Yeah.  Why are we here?  Ah, because it's Thanksgiving.  What is it?  What is it?  I think...  She says turkey funny. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, oh, oh.  The Chugniki.  Oh, oh, oh.  Potatoes.  Um, that girl that did the Chinese food song for that crazy pedophile-ish looking black  guy? 
[00:26:00]  Right.  Um, she had a fucking follow-up hit or something.  Another one?  Or it was a pre-hit before the Chinese food one.  Right.  Where, um...  I don't know.  She's, like, fucking singing another horrible song with that guy.  What is the subject?  I don't know.  It's like A, B, C, D.  Oh, the alphabet thing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I saw that one.  Yeah.  It's just...  But how do they make money off these songs?  I think...  Are kids actually downloading them?  Well, they get a lot of views.  Yeah. 
[00:26:30]  But I think that black guy is the only one really making money off of this.  He gets the families to, like, pay money.  Oh.  And then he makes these videos.  Oh, for the rich kid?  Yeah.  For the old...  It's a rich kid situation?  It's such a little rich kid thing.  ...with average talent.  Right.  And then they...  But then the parents are so bloody rich, they find the black producer and go, hey, make  my kid a little star.  And they go, we got everything.  It's like a package deal.  We'll supply the song, the fucking video, the outlet to put it out there, and there you 
[00:27:00]  go.  And he convinces them that your Twitter followers will go up and become awareness, and this  is what you need to be a pop star.  And then the kid learns something called internet hatred.  Yeah.  Because the fucking...  The hate that they get...  This guy's worse than any bully.  He is.  He puts these kids out there to just be bullied.  You're right.  What is this one?  This is ABCDEFG.  All right, let me hear this.  Yeah, this is a...  There's an opening where it looks like...  Holy shit, 2.4 million views, basically. 
[00:27:30]  Where it looks like Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.  Right, but it's the same black producer that produces these shitty songs that are doing  really well.  And he's looking, and then there's the girl.  Is that a vagina pillow?  I don't know what that is.  And then he's peeking in the window all creepily.  What the fuck's he looking at?  I don't know.  He's so creepy.  And then apparently that's a boy.  No, that's a girl.  But she's trying to, like... 
[00:28:00]  I don't know.  She's trying to get, like, his attention.  Looks like a...  Oh, my God.  A lesbian...  I don't know.  How embarrassing.  Isn't it terrible?  Why would parents do this to their kid?  I don't know.  But there's haters that just are brutal to these kids.  What a good song, though. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, I mean, you can't take that away.  Yeah, you can't take that away.  Yeah.  And then she hops in this, like, van.  She gets into a stranger's van that has no windows.  And he's, like, driving it around like a little Matchbox car through his Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood  looking thing.  See, I think that's a boy.  Maybe that is a dude.  He's got, like, wacky fucking...  Whoa.  He's got wacky Sam Roberts hair.  Because these are all her friends.  Because you would never cast that kid in that role. 
[00:29:00]  I don't know.  I think this black guy comes up with everything.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  No, but I think she goes, hey, I want my friends in this.  You think?  And then he figures out how to use the friends.  Yeah, I think so.  I don't like the whole thing behind this video, though.  This is weird.  Why would a little girl go to a club to meet a guy?  She's 12.  Yeah, yeah.  Love potion.  And this dude is just, like, looking in her window with love potion in a van. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, he's trying to, like...  Now he's pouring love potion into the fake club she's in?  He's spiking her drink.  He's spiking her drink.  With love potion.  She's 12, maybe 13.  And now there's a bunch of, like, Muppet puppets dancing around the club.  Puppet potion, not love potion.  Right.  But wouldn't she turn into the puppet because she drank the shit?  I don't get it.  Why does she drink the puppet potion and everyone else turns into a puppet?  I don't know.  This is the part where that black dude gives himself a little shine time.  He always gives himself a little moment. 
[00:30:00]  She's dancing horribly at the club now.  Now Cupid comes back and, oh, hit the little black kid.  And now he's in love with her.  This guy obviously wanted to be, like, a rapper producer before he decided to just ruin kids' lives instead.  Yes, exactly.  Ooh.  All right, with the AVC.  Oh, my God.  This is horrible.  Oh, good.  He brought human potion with him.  Oh, so he changed the puppets back.  Yeah, changed the puppets back to people. 
[00:30:30]  But they already are people.  But they have to drink the potion.  No.  Uh-oh.  See, now the black kid turned into Chinese food.  Why?  Do you get it?  Wrong potion again?  No, because she's the girl who's saying Chinese food.  She loves Chinese food.  But that was Chinese food.  No, this is the sequel.  And now she just ate her friend.  Yeah.  What happened?  She just shoved his egg roll in her mouth.  Yeah, was that the dick? 
[00:31:00]  I don't know.  They all have this pedophile-like fucking edge to them.  This is a bad man.  He is evil.  He's pure evil.  Why are these videos doing so well?  I don't know.  And this one is, like, this is at 2.4 million.  Right.  And it's not considered a hit.  No.  Really?  It's a boss.  No way.  Alison Gold.  Why?  What did the Thanksgiving song do?  Oh, Thanksgiving?  That did, uh...  Thanksgiving did 15.2 million.  15.  15.2 million?  15.2 million.  Chinese food did 13.1. 
[00:31:30]  Wow.  Uh-oh.  So the ABC song is a bust.  And what about the original?  The one that started it all?  Friday?  Yeah, yeah.  I think Friday is off his channel.  Wow.  Why?  Like, that one became so big.  Right.  It transcended his shit.  Yeah, what's-her-name who sang it made it her own thing?  Yeah, but why wouldn't he keep it on his channel?  I don't know.  No, she, like, I think she said, we want the rights to this.  You can't have this, you know, as an issue.  I heard she hung him out a window and said, sign this song over to me. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Something like that.  See, it's on Rebecca Black's channel.  Yes.  Which is obviously run by Suge Knight.  Right.  And it's-  Wait, she started out with that guy?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, this song was-  And it's got the same formula.  60 million views.  Wow.  60 million for Friday, Friday.  Friday, Friday.  See, he's got a verse on this.  Oh, yeah.  There he is.  He's there, driving the car.  He's like, fucking A.  Yeah.  There's the guy, though.  Yeah.  He's a hit maker.  Shit maker. 
[00:32:30]  A shit maker, yes.  What the kids are fucking watching.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wow.  This is-  Party and party.  I'm looking at the likes and dislikes.  Yeah.  It's really lopsided.  Okay.  There's 315,000 likes.  Wow, that's good.  There's 1.2 million dislikes.  Oh, no.  I would take those numbers.  How do you not like it?  Even if they're dislikes.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Just the 1.2.  I would take those numbers.  How do you not, right?  Those are some nice numbers to look at.  Oh, God.  These numbers are pretty sweet. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, yeah.  Did you see the old video I posted?  Oh, God, yes.  Oh, my God.  That video was buried for a while.  Wow.  Put it front and center.  The Thanksgiving video that we did at the AAF.  Yeah, when we were doing the Real Rock TV show.  Yes.  We were the stars of that show, right?  Oh, yeah.  By far, right?  Even though Rock Hole is in that video.  Is he?  Yeah, Rock Hole and...  Rest in peace, brother.  Yeah.  Rest in peace, brother.  Yeah, Rock Hole and one of the morning guys. 
[00:33:30]  I think a couple of the morning guys.  Yeah, it was the whole crew had to do the fucking thing.  Put it on our Facebook page, E.  Yeah, that's Kevin.  That's fine.  Kevin Barber, who's out of work.  And we're eating our Thanksgiving dinner.  There's Rock Hole.  And then the girl goes,  But I never even had any kidneys.  No!  I'm choking, because that was so funny.  I know what that means. 
[00:34:00]  It wasn't a place to race.  Oh, no.  Anthony, he's choking.  Oh, see.  He's choking, and we're guessing.  The only time Ant has ever touched me, by the way.  Yes, I'm getting the Heimlich maneuver.  And there you go.  The whole turkey.  An entire turkey.  I'm flying out.  Look at the stupid hair. 
[00:34:30]  Who is that fucking guy?  Who are those people?  Why would you eat an entire turkey?  I don't know, but it was stuck in his throat.  It was a whole turkey.  You thought he wanted to play charades.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  You're so silly.  You know?  Oh, fucking.  Wow.  I'll retweet that.  It's really brutal to watch.  It certainly is.  Can we talk about Alec Baldwin?  Another guy getting a fucking raw deal.  Yeah.  They wanted an apology. 
[00:35:00]  The guy apologizes.  We said it.  We, well, no surprise anymore, I guess.  But we've been saying this for years.  You know, we knew the apology wouldn't.  Save His Ass.  No, it never does.  They want, they demand an apology before they can fire your ass.  Yeah.  It's the weirdest fucking thing.  Yeah.  So he apologizes about a week ago or whatever, and then they fired him from his MSNBC show.  Yeah.  MSNBC has nothing going on.  Someone like Alec Baldwin was going to bring in the people.  Yeah.  He probably would have at least gotten some people to sample it. 
[00:35:30]  And just because he said what?  Faggot?  I think he said cock-sucking faggot.  Fathead.  Fathead, he says.  Cock-sucking fathead.  Why, you fathead?  Wait, cock-sucking fathead?  That's what he says.  So he didn't even say faggot?  He says that he said fathead.  But he did say faggot?  Oh, he said faggot.  It sounds like that.  All right.  But he knows the culture, so he's trying to save his fucking ass.  Yeah.  You're allowed to say that stuff.  Apparently not.  But you are.  Yeah.  You're going to lose your job. 
[00:36:00]  Especially when he's being harassed on the street like he is.  I know.  Martin Bashir went on MSNBC itself, like the network itself.  Right.  And advocated for Sarah Palin being shit on.  And Alec Baldwin just called a paparazzi a cock-socker.  But he's the right color.  We all know that.  Oh.  If you're the right color, you get away with a little more.  That, um...  I mean, why did they hire him in the first place, then?  I mean, why? 
[00:36:30]  But this shit is so dangerous, and it's already having a major effect.  Yeah.  You know, you don't really...  You don't expect anything to happen on these shows.  Because everyone's scared shitless of saying the wrong thing.  That's the, uh...  Yeah.  That's the thing you don't want to do.  Be caught saying the wrong thing.  They'll throw you right out of your job.  Unbelievable.  It's ridiculous.  When we all say shitty things, we all...  We all do fucked up things.  Of course.  But let's make believe we don't, right? 
[00:37:00]  Oh.  What?  I'm hearing, um...  Let me see what I'm hearing here.  It's because he was a cock-sucker behind the scenes.  That's not...  He was a fucking asshole.  And they were just trying to find a reason to get rid of him?  A fucking prick.  Well.  Well.  Is that a good source?  That's a pretty good source, I gotta admit.  Hmm.  Who's the source?  Can you write it down?  No, no, no, no.  No, I wouldn't say it.  But it's...  I don't think you know.  Well.  This person works, uh...  Someone, let's just say, on the inside. 
[00:37:30]  Of MSNBC.  Maybe.  Yep.  Yep.  Okay.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  On the inside.  A lot of weed fucking cocksuckers.  Well, we have different...  Hard to work with?  Yeah, we have a different job, though.  Description.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know, man.  Uh, well, I wonder why they hired him, then.  If, you know, if he was that bad to start with, they should have just, uh...  Well, we've all heard over the years, you know, that he has a reputation. 
[00:38:00]  Treated his staff like shit.  Screamed at everyone.  Wow.  So, there's no surprise that the guy might be a dick if you hire him.  Yeah.  He just looks like he'd be a prick to work with.  Oh, wait.  Does this person maybe 30 rock days?  Um...  You don't want to say.  Late to tapings.  Oh.  Late to tapings.  There's a quote that is in this article.  Uh-huh.  Right.  That says, uh, according to the Post, Baldwin alienated staffers when he demanded a separate 
[00:38:30]  makeup room being used by a woman with cancer who is sensitive to hairspray.  Oh, boy.  When he, when told he could not have that room, he allegedly shouted, quote, I don't  give a fuck if she has cancer or not.  I want that fucking makeup room.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Well, that would make him a prick.  That, uh, that's a good one.  But he didn't...  I can't argue that, but, I mean, you can't fire the guy because he said some shitty things 
[00:39:00]  on the street.  And he didn't call the woman a faggot, so...  That's true.  With that said, Joan fucking Rivers.  Joan Rivers, yes.  God bless this lady.  I don't like her because she's never done our fucking radio show, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  But, you know, fair is fair, man.  She said some great shit about this whole thing.  TMZ picked it up, and we got the clip.  What do I think about Alec Denningvall?  Let me tell you, everybody just relax.  Everybody is either a whop, a nigger, a kite, a chink, a fairy, a myth. 
[00:39:30]  Everybody's something.  So why don't we all just calm down?  We should be thankful for you.  Be thankful that we're all living in America and stop everybody getting so damn untied.  And this goes to the Indians, both dot and feather.  Wow.  Always a pleasure.  Take care.  Bye-bye.  God bless Joan Rivers.  Just blurting it out there.  What's up, Jimmy?  Hi, buddy.  Jimmy's back.  Yes.  God bless Joan Rivers. 
[00:40:00]  Will she get in trouble for that?  No.  She's Joan Rivers.  She's beyond trouble, I think.  She's untouchable.  Good.  She's one of the untouchables.  Right.  There's not many untouchables out there.  There are a few out there, but, you know, who else?  Don Rickles is an untouchable.  Ew.  What's the matter?  Chewed up pen cap in front of you?  They're grown-ups.  Who chews up the pen caps, you fucking freaks?  Yeah, I think she's untouchable, Joan Rivers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know she's going to say something horrible.  Yeah.  Well, she was sticking up for Alec Baldwin. 
[00:40:30]  She said the N-word.  Ooh.  Did you hear the clip?  I heard part of the clip through the...  Oh, let me play it again for you.  Yeah.  They asked her about Alec Baldwin, who, of course, got fired.  We all knew he would.  Yeah, I'm a CBC stings.  They were waiting for the apology.  You've got to get the apology, then you fire the guy.  Joan Rivers said this.  What do I think about Alec getting involved?  Let me tell you, everybody just relax.  Everybody is either a womp, a nigger, a kike, a chink, a fairy, a mick.  Everybody's something.  So why don't we all just calm down? 
[00:41:00]  We should be thankful for you.  Be thankful that we're all living in America and stop everybody getting so damn untied.  Absolutely.  And this goes for the Indians, both dot and feather.  Thank you.  Always a pleasure.  Take care.  Bye-bye.  That's good.  Bravo.  Good for her.  Yes.  Indeed he do.  Good for her.  Because she's fierce.  That's why they don't fuck with her.  Because if they asked her for an apology, she'd attack them.  Right.  Shit, go fuck yourself.  For what?  Apologize for what?  Apologize.  I'm not apologizing, you fucking asshole. 
[00:41:30]  So we should take a break, then.  Where's our grub?  Yeah.  The grub might be a little late today.  Is our grub coming?  It's pouring out there.  It is.  It wasn't as bad as I thought, though.  Coming in, I switched.  How the fuck did you fly in today?  I switched.  I was supposed to come back today, but we wrapped early last night, like six.  So I fucking, I just panicked and switched.  I'm like, I want to make it back.  And I'm not like missing the show, but I don't have to.  It's like, oh, you should just relax out there in L.A.  No.  Enjoy yourself. 
[00:42:00]  Have some sushi.  No, I did.  The other night.  I'm thankful.  You need to relax.  You might not have been able to get out.  Yeah, with the storm talk, I was like, let me get back.  And I took the late one.  I said that.  Smart.  Was it bimpy coming in?  Very.  We were 40 minutes late.  That flight's never late.  A little bumpy?  It was.  Yeah, it was quite, quite rocky.  Scary bumpy?  No, I found this.  I like it bumpy when I'm on a 767.  I root for turbulence.  Oh, that's true.  I like, it's almost like rocking me to sleep.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I doze off in violent turbulence on a 767.  That's great.  Nice. 
[00:42:30]  On a little plane, I'm panicking everybody else.  Oh, that's great.  I miss bumps when I ride my car.  I miss bumps.  The bumps?  Yeah, when I first started driving the SUVs back in the day, they gave you a nice little  bumpy ride.  Very smooth now.  Too smooth, man.  I don't like that.  When you get that weird shit in your stomach.  I got a rental car now that's not quite as luxurious as the old Escalade.  Right.  For a little while until they fix up my Escalade.  Right.  Yeah.  I'm like, it's a Durango. 
[00:43:00]  I'm not very happy with it.  People are saying, check out Joan Rivers' documentary, A Piece of Work.  I see it.  We've all seen it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's a great documentary, too.  Yes, I'm beating the shit out of it, though.  Oh, good.  I don't feather the throttle at all.  It's either full on the floor or my foot's off it.  Well, that's what those cars are made for.  Ball!  You've got to beat the shit out of the car.  Yes.  Where's Travis?  I asked him to look up a song that's in the documentary Burn.  I want to play it today.  Is he having gay sex somewhere in the building? 
[00:43:30]  He was planning on having gay sex today, you said.  Oh.  Why don't we do this?  I've got a cool song.  Hopefully, you guys will like it.  It's from Dennis Leary's Burn documentary.  It's how the documentary starts.  They only use a little piece of this song.  Uh-huh.  You haven't seen Burn yet?  No.  I saw it last night and saw it the night before.  This fucking documentary is great.  What's it about?  I'm guessing Fireman.  He loves Fireman.  Detroit.  Detroit Fire Department.  And the fucking uphill battle they have with no resources to try to control the unbelievable 
[00:44:00]  amount of fires.  You think they look at it as an uphill battle or do they look at it as like, wow, we get  to be cowboys every fucking day?  There were people that were, there was some firemen they were interviewing that said they  love their job and they love the fact that they get to put out a lot of fires in Detroit.  If you're a fireman and you like putting out fires, I would gather that's a good job,  but it's got to be frustrating to not have the tools to do it.  Why didn't they, I'm wondering some more stats.  Like how many fires a day in Detroit? 
[00:44:30]  I don't know.  Because they were going on multiple calls every single day.  Yeah.  But I wonder how many fires, if they got a number on that.  I don't know.  I bet it's a lot.  But anyway, this documentary, well shot.  Yeah.  Great stories.  And great music.  Yeah.  And it started off with this song by, who was it again?  The Stooges.  It was, oh, it was the Stooges.  Ziggy and the Stooges, right.  And the name of the song is?  Give Me Shelter. 
[00:45:00]  He keeps saying Give Me Shelter.  Stop saying Give Me Shelter.  Give Me Danger.  Give Me Danger.  So let's check this out and we'll be back.  Give me a danger, little stranger.  And I'll feel you, you're a disease. 
[00:45:30]  There's nothing in my dreams.  Just some ugly memories.  Kiss me like the ocean breeze.  Now if you will be my lover, I will see you and sing. 
[00:46:00]  Baby, you can't be my master.  I will do anything.  There's nothing left alive but a pair of glassy eyes.  Raise my feelings one more time.  Yeah. 
[00:46:30]  Hey, find a little trick.  Find your little trick.  Yeah, you're gonna feel my hand.  Say, darling, it ain't no wise.  Oh, little trick.  Oh, you're gonna feel my hand.  I swear you're gonna feel my hand.  I swear you're gonna feel my hand.  You're gonna be my hand. 
[00:47:00]  It's true  It's true  It's true  It's true 
[00:47:30]  It's true  It's true  It's true  It's true  It's true 
[00:48:00]  It's true  It's true  It's true  It's true  It's true  It's true 
[00:48:30]  It's true  The Opie and Anthony Show  Sirius XM  The guys are back from the toilet. Now back to our show.  It's very low in the mix. Thank you, Eric. Thank you. 
[00:49:00]  Thank you, Eric. Thank you.  What is this?  Just a bed. Just a bed. All right, then.  I'll go to sleep, then.  I'll go to sleep, then.  Let's see because...  Get it?  Mm-hmm.  I think Colin Quinn's coming in today.  We weren't expecting Jimmy today. 
[00:49:30]  Mm-mm.  You guys got your hopes up, and I fucking shot back, but I had to.  Calls mad at me now.  Why?  Well, last night on the Twitter, and on the phone yesterday, I said that I was going to go see him do Unconstitutional in Bayshore.  In Bayshore.  Right.  Because it's kind of close to me. I want to see Call on Saturday night. Then I was reminded by my brother Joe that I had put together a poker game for Saturday at my house. 
[00:50:00]  So, once again, I cannot see Colin, and he was a little, you know, I think he was a little hurt on Twitter about it.  Well, he should be.  I've got to deal with that.  You could play poker any day.  Absolutely.  Well, I had already made plans, though.  The great Colin Quinn is very close to your house.  Exactly.  I know.  He's really sick.  What?  Oh, nothing.  Oh, no, Colin.  He's doing his last shows.  Oh, no.  He's been trying to keep it under his hat.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  He's fine. 
[00:50:30]  Fine.  You.  What are you doing for Thanksgiving, Jimmy?  I just put eggs in my mouth.  Sorry.  It's okay.  I'm going to my friend's house.  Bobby's?  No.  Bobby didn't invite me.  Aw.  No, but he met me.  I don't know if he wants me to stay all right.  He just wants to have him and his family.  Right.  You're going to Jerry Seinfeld's house for Thanksgiving?  No.  Whoa.  Nice.  Yeah, it was nice. 
[00:51:00]  Nice.  That's very nice.  Yeah.  Good for you.  Maybe Bobby might be there.  Yeah.  Or maybe he's with his wife.  I don't know.  All right.  Now that he's got his little family.  Yeah.  You're out.  Sorry, you're out, Jim.  I don't like it.  I know.  Maybe I could help with the turkey.  You're out, Jim.  You're out!  I think I'll see Bobby Sunday.  Yeah?  Yeah.  That's my tradition.  Yes.  Bobby, his wife, and the baby.  And the little cute little baby.  I actually ordered cookies today.  I'm going to bring cookies.  Oh.  I never bring food to people.  I'm so sick of being a bad guest. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  And this same person invited me to his birthday party.  And there was like six people there.  And I went there and I didn't bring a gift.  Oh, Jim.  Oh, Jim.  I didn't know.  What a social faux pas.  But dude, it's like I just didn't think.  I was like, oh yeah, I'll stop over.  Well, maybe you should've.  I know.  Plot.  I don't like bringing shit to people's houses either.  No.  And I don't care if they don't bring shit to my house.  Right.  But I guess it doesn't work that way.  No.  It's like a thing.  It's a thing, right?  It's a thing, right?  That's gotta be done.  I gotta bring cheese to my brother's house. 
[00:52:00]  Ew.  Cheese and crackers.  I gotta, I gotta, I gotta bring two kids.  You know?  Ugh.  Oh, boy.  Let the kids pull the cheese and crackers  and put their fingers all over it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let them enjoy it.  I got a three and a half year old and a one year old.  I'm going way out east for Thanksgiving,  so I, I have to tell Jimmy.  So I go to my brother, what can I bring?  And he gives me the worst thing possible.  Cheese, cheese and crackers.  I tell you.  What happened to just, yeah, pick up a pie  or pick up a couple bottles of wine? 
[00:52:30]  What, do I have to cut up the cheese?  No.  Just go get those pre-made platters.  They're perfect.  Perfect.  But I think we already, you know, got blocks of cheese.  And now what?  I gotta cut it up and then try to put it on top of my luggage somewhere?  Yeah, that's crazy.  You gotta see my car when I pack with these two kids.  It's a nightmare.  You don't have a big platter at home?  I do.  I think cheese is the better option on Thanksgiving  because pies, the line is gonna, this line,  I have to pick these fucking cocksucker cookies up today, 
[00:53:00]  the line's gonna be an hour.  Oh, man.  Where are you going for your cookies?  The place that Roland did his birthday cake?  Yeah.  Heads.  Right.  Which, of course, you know, I called a day, I called this Monday  and they wouldn't make me a cake.  They're like, oh, the cake thing is closed.  Yeah.  Well, it's kind of cake season.  No, I understand.  I understand that, but.  They sell, you better get there quick if you want a chocolate babka.  They sell out of those pretty quick.  Around Thanksgiving.  No, you're not gonna get me today.  Nope.  Not at all.  Not today.  No, I'm just saying.  Watch for the chocolate babka.  Not today.  But I think, I wish cheese would be a great option. 
[00:53:30]  I should've got cheese.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah, man.  There's no one in the cheese line.  Give me your cookies and you can have my fucking cheese.  No, cause to give me my cookies I'll have to stand in line for them.  Once I got them, I'm bringing them.  Yeah.  I don't know why I'm annoyed by having to bring cheese.  It's a terrible thing.  I know.  You are annoyed.  I'm definitely annoyed.  Cause when you say, what do you want me to bring?  People are supposed to go, nothing, just come.  Right, right.  Maybe they're never supposed to say.  Or the liquor store.  A couple bottles of wine, right?  Oh, that's always nice.  That would be nice.  Sure.  I don't know.  There's never a specific thing. 
[00:54:00]  I always go, oh, just bring yourself.  Exactly.  You're plenty.  Exactly.  Mm-hmm.  And then they usually wind up bringing something.  I don't.  I'm a bad guest.  Oh.  No more bad guests.  It's time to grow up and bring big boy gifts to people.  Aw.  Nice.  Aw.  I feel bad.  When you invite me again, I'll bring whatever you need.  I'd be happy to.  We haven't invited anyone lately.  But I like Bobby.  The house is a mad house.  I haven't given anything for anybody's kids, and it's not that I don't care.  I just, I fucking, I fucking, my nephew, my own nephew, I didn't give anything. 
[00:54:30]  I feel terrible.  Yeah.  I'm a piece of shit.  I wonder when I'll have my next get together.  It'll be a while.  A little soiree.  Yeah.  I'm a lovely guest.  I'm sober.  I don't cause a ruckus.  I make polite chatter.  Oh.  He is a great guest to have around the house.  Mm-hmm.  He's funny.  He's fun, and very, um.  Clean and conscientious.  Yes, yes.  Respect people's property.  Exactly.  Well, that's very nice of you.  Heh heh heh heh heh. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  This is just a weird day.  Why's that?  Because I think we should just not be here.  Well, you know, I don't think anyone else is.  Huh?  I know.  No one's here.  They're off.  Everyone is off, right?  Pretty much, yeah.  Yeah.  We'll be off tomorrow and Friday.  Everyone's off.  I'm not bitching.  It's just weird to be here today.  No, you're bitching.  Because all I'm thinking about is I gotta cut up cheese and pack a car with two kids.  I'm busy.  I got shit to do.  A lot of shit to do.  I cut up cheese. 
[00:55:30]  Then the kid woke up at four in the morning crying.  Oh, God.  Still crying at one years old.  How do you do that?  It's not easy, brother.  I don't know how the fuck.  Any interruption to my sleep.  Oh, really?  Oh, the alarm annoys me when it goes off.  I can't imagine.  I never sleep to my alarm.  Never.  I'm always awake before that thing goes off.  Why was your kid crying?  Just tooth pain or just...  Yeah, after cutting a tooth, they could...  My tooth!  She's been pretty good lately, but...  Yeah.  I don't know what the hell was wrong this morning. 
[00:56:00]  We thought my other kid had measles.  I had to run him to the doctor yesterday.  Yeah.  It's a full-time job.  Well, yeah.  I picked him up at school, got him home, and I sat down to relax and maybe check some  numbers and watch burn.  And then all of a sudden, we're looking at this kid going, oh my God, he might have  measles.  Wow.  So then I had to run him to the doctor, which is not too close to my house, and that's  why I brought up the traffic.  I should have mentioned that earlier, that Manhattan traffic yesterday was brutal. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  You drive or just hop in a cab?  I drove and then I did a really shitty thing.  If someone did this to me, I probably would maybe punch somebody.  Oh, wow.  It's a horrible rainy day.  You got a kid that might have measles.  So I pull right up to where the doctor's office is in this building and just double parked  on a road where they needed both lanes to run the kid in.  Yeah.  Because they were closing and there's no garages nearby.  And you're certainly not going to get street parking.  Right.  So I really... 
[00:57:00]  Bless you, love.  I got to admit, I did a real shitty thing yesterday.  And then as I'm waiting for them to take my kid, I'm looking out the window, I could  see my car from the window and it's just like me out there.  Oh, you're just blocking.  And it's because of me.  Oh, you were the guy.  But then I started panicking and I told the ladies in there to watch my kid and they're  like, if you double park on a side street, it won't be as bad.  So then I did do that at least.  But that was at least 10, 15 minutes later.  I'm just causing problems for people. 
[00:57:30]  Do you have an Uber app?  Like, sometimes a cab takes the pressure off because you don't have to worry about  your car.  There was no way the cab...  You weren't getting in a cab yesterday.  This was at 5.30, a horrible rainy night.  You were not getting a cab.  I thought of that option because I knew I wasn't going to find parking up near the  doctor's office.  Ain't gonna happen.  Long story short, he doesn't have the measles.  Oh, good thing.  I'm so happy he goes to school so he can get sick every other week.  Oh, is that...  It's unbelievable.  Well, they have to go through all that shit, though. 
[00:58:00]  That builds up their immune system, I hear.  And then, like, there was one case of lice in the classroom, so all the kids have to  be checked for lice.  But they make believe that they're having their hair checked for their haircuts checked  or something.  Because they don't want to tell the kids...  Body and luster.  Yeah, they don't want to tell the kids that, you know...  You got bugs.  They might have bugs.  They might have bugs.  So it's some hair check, but...  Yeah.  But then if their hair is bad...  I don't know what you tell the kid.  What?  Go get a haircut?  We don't like your haircuts. 
[00:58:30]  You gotta shave your head and put fucking tar on it.  You got bugs.  Yeah, how do you get rid of the lice?  They have that rid shit.  My kid doesn't have them, by the way.  It's not my kid.  Rid.  Oh, yeah.  That's how I used her crabs when I was a teenager.  Oh, nice.  Three times.  Crabs.  Right.  Mark Goodman.  Oh, there he is.  He's gonna tit the button.  And turn...  For free.  I heard.  Oh, and if you call the number on this screen, you'll get a great offer, but...  Oh.  I didn't tell you that. 
[00:59:00]  In fact...  But you did.  I was never here.  But you were.  Commercial.  Why are you sneaking around?  He's gonna push the big button.  Why is the button there?  Wouldn't the button be under, like, a lock?  Yeah, they wouldn't have a button.  I don't think they have a button that activates all the inactive radios.  And it would be guarded.  Right.  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  There's a building.  It's a bug.  Yeah.  Uh...  Sway and Kanye went at it yesterday here at SiriusXM, huh? 
[00:59:30]  What happened?  Is it worth playing, Sam Roberts?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You guys...  It'll...  It'll get you guys all riled up.  You got a picture with Kanye yesterday.  Did Kanye mock his Jiffy Pop hat?  No.  No?  His popcorn hat?  His Jiffy Pop popcorn hat.  Yeah.  What are you looking today?  Well, he hasn't come in yet, but his show doesn't start until 8, I don't think.  Do you have a turkey under his hat?  What is the...  What is the Black Man's Morning Show start at 8?  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  It seems like...  I would like to start at 8. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, boy.  That seems offensive to me.  Hey, look.  CQ.  What?  CQ has arrived.  Oh, wow.  CQ.  Get him in here.  Here we go.  Come on, Carl.  Come on in, Carl.  CQ.  Take his seat.  He's got his umbrella.  Like a gentleman.  I know.  An umbrella and everything.  Look at you, guys.  What's up, guys?  He's pointing with his umbrella like a gentleman.  What's up, Carlos?  Gentlemen.  I understand my unconscious blinking was fodder for your humor.  Oh, boy.  What are you talking about? 
[01:00:30]  I like the leather jacket, CQ.  You're looking good.  I imagine you reminded me of some of the...  Oh, you son of a bitch.  Oh, no.  I was hungry, actually.  Oh, man.  What are those things?  A little breakfast bar?  I don't know, but...  Jimmy was ready to smash them and throw them in the garbage.  I think my acting was very good in your piece.  That's not what we were talking about.  Oh, good.  Oh.  Oh.  You're talking about in general.  Why don't you come in and shed light instead of bringing darkness?  No.  I'm trying, but...  That's a good statement for the holidays.  I'm trying, but...  You guys are really going at me hammering togs.  We were about to play a clip of Sway and Kanye West going at it. 
[01:01:00]  Apparently they had a little beef going on yesterday.  Let's hear it.  They call it a beef.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's the set up here?  Used to be drama.  Yeah.  Well, uh...  Kanye's just an asshole, right?  He looks like Keith Robinson in that photo.  He does.  Less ornery.  He's talking about fashion and how good he is at designing sneakers.  Oh.  Enough with him talking about how good he is at shit.  Oh, that's his old gimmick.  He finds himself to be good.  Is he good at that shit, though?  Yeah.  I mean...  Oh, yeah. 
[01:01:30]  He drops it.  Yeah.  Galliano stole some of his ideas, he was saying.  Wow.  Financially, he's been successful in his endeavors.  Uh-huh.  But yeah, and so Sway posed the question, which many have brought up, which is, if you  hate the corporation so much, why don't you go and just do it yourself?  Go rogue.  Go rogue.  Who are some of the guys that have gone rogue?  I mean...  The Jay-Z.  Yeah, I think.  The Diddy.  The Diddy.  Yeah, Jay-Z's definitely not part of any major corporations. 
[01:02:00]  Are you guys nuts?  How do you think the world works?  They don't do that.  But doesn't he make his own shit, though?  And then he gets it in the stores?  I'm sure Malad is very pleased in the last 15 years.  Oh, I'm certain of it.  By the parade of hip-hop stars.  Yes, yes.  And their fashion.  I'm sure it's been good for the museums.  Now, go on.  What's going on?  I mean, Jay-Z.  He could get sweatpants in his stores.  He's not like, you know...  Kanye West, I think, wants to start some kind of high fashion. 
[01:02:30]  Yes.  Does he not understand this?  Two questions about Kanye West.  I hope these are questions for Sam, because he didn't seem to understand.  Sam's an idiot, but I'm going to ask him.  I'm going to ask him.  The multi-billion dollar empire.  They're directed at Sam, but they're really rhetorical because he's a dunce.  Does Kanye understand that one of the reasons nobody cares about his fashion is because he's  such a twat that he's hateable?  Right.  And it's like, even if he is a smart guy and great at this, nobody wants to think of  Kanye all day because he's a fucking baby boy. 
[01:03:00]  He's a brat.  And that's what he comes off like.  Yeah, but I think people do care about his fashion because people talk about him all  the time.  People give a fuck about making money.  Jay-Z was a drug dealer and people are happy to be in business with him.  Why are they not wanting to be in business with this guy?  Because he's a twat.  That's the point.  You just made my point.  If they can make money off him, who gives a fuck if he's a twat?  But I think that the general public might not respond as well as a whole.  He's also making more money being a twat than he would being quiet.  This is his whole thing.  Good point, Sam. 
[01:03:30]  Maybe.  But the fashion thing is really a twat.  Why does he have to be a twat?  Because we talk about him every day.  Yes.  And then he sells concert tickets.  But he's not thinking of that when he's doing this.  He knows what he's doing.  I don't buy that.  I think he's a brat.  He's doing interviews at every radio station on his tour and it's the same questions  that Sway's asking, but he's picking and choosing when he freaks out.  He knows what he's doing.  Let me ask you, is he an only child?  He seems like an only child.  I don't know.  He seems like a fucking spoiled only child.  He probably is.  I just want to make sure.  He seems like a baby boy.  Yeah.  Bit of a baby boy. 
[01:04:00]  Well, let's hear him.  Baby.  Titled.  Let's go, Sway.  Come on.  What's going to happen with the red Octobers?  The red Octobers are some sneakers that I guess he's designing.  It's a movie.  For Nike.  For Nike.  I'm a hump for him.  I didn't need to know that.  You didn't.  I don't care what a red October is.  I just assume it's some shit.  You know what Nike told me?  When I asked him?  We ain't sure.  Oh shit.  You know what they told the store though?  Of my boy that run a store?  They said, if y'all want that red October, you got to take these 10 other shoes. 
[01:04:30]  So they told me, they ain't sure.  But then they told him, if you want that red October, but legally, we got to both sign  that contract.  Mark Parker.  I'm going to put Mark Parker all on that summer jam screen.  And by the way, Mark Parker, yes, I will still accept an investment in Donda.  I got some more ideas that don't involve shoes.  But if you guys are investing in the arts, y'all want to invest in this school in Brazil.  Y'all want to go to Africa.  I'm standing up and I'm telling you, I am Warhol. 
[01:05:00]  I am the number one most impactful artist of our generation.  I am Shakespeare in the flesh.  Walt Disney, Nike, Google.  Now who's going to be the McGee fan?  Sway's laughing, thank God.  He understands the value of what he's doing, but he does mean this.  It's like, he understands that, but he's also a little entitled baby boy who really,  you don't just make this shit up.  But he also knows the absurdity of what he's saying and that yelling this out will get immediate 
[01:05:30]  WWE shit right here.  It almost evokes to mind, I'm a network star.  I'm a network star.  I'm a headline.  When does it get good?  Do you even understand?  Let me tell you.  All right.  Sway has to retort.  Well, Sway's been laughing.  So let's see what happens.  ...and stand up and let me create more.  Or do you want to marginalize me till I'm out of my moment?  Or why don't you empower yourself and don't need them and do it yourself? 
[01:06:00]  How, Sway?  Have you in a minute back, that's going to take taking a few steps back to go-  You ain't got the answers, man!  You ain't got the answers, Sway!  You ain't got the answers.  You ain't got the answers.  You ain't got the answers.  You ain't got the answers.  I've been doing an education.  Calm down.  You don't have the answers, though.  Calm down.  Because you're trying to give me advice about something.  No, no, no, no.  You ain't got the answer.  You ain't spent $13 million of your own money trying to empower yourself. 
[01:06:30]  But I spent hundreds of thousands and I'm putting out clothing lines at a smaller degree.  All I'm asking you is.  It ain't no Ralph, though.  It ain't Ralph level.  Let me ask you this.  What's the name of your clothing line?  We don't know.  Come on.  You don't see it.  But that's not over.  Exactly.  And I can lose money on a higher level, too.  And that's what I'm asking you.  Because I got the most of the least money.  Let me finish my question, dog.  No, man.  Let me hear the question, man.  You don't have the answers.  I'm asking you for the answer.  It's a question. 
[01:07:00]  Why is it that you can't?  You have money.  I just told you I lost the money because I did not have the knowledge of how to do it the right way.  Okay, so you don't have money.  So you don't have the money to do it.  That's your answer.  You ain't got to turn up, man.  This ain't no fucking show, man.  I'm talking to you as a homie.  It ain't no homie, man.  Because the thing is, the bottom line is.  Man, all I'm saying, you ain't got to turn up.  You ain't got to turn up, Sam.  It ain't got to be no hold up.  You ain't got to turn up.  I like that.  I'm going to use that.  I'm going to steal that from the black man. 
[01:07:30]  What do you mean?  It ain't no hold up, man.  We here talking as civil rights.  Ain't no hold up.  I'm trying to understand your world because when I go to your concert, I'm curious about what you're saying.  I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you the question.  Well, I'm explaining to you what it is.  But you ain't got to turn up on me, man to man, dog.  You ain't got to turn up.  Fuck these mics.  We could turn all this shit off.  Oh, shit.  You ain't got to do this.  It's cool.  I love you, bro.  But you ain't got to turn up.  Don't try to embarrass us.  This is how gunfire starts.  What I'm trying to say to y'all is this industry of what I'm trying to get into. 
[01:08:00]  Sway's great, man.  He really is.  Ain't nobody never broke down.  Ain't nobody broke down.  We all slaves.  So I ain't trying to disrespect you on your show.  We all slaves or something.  I ain't trying to disrespect you, period.  Let me talk if you're going to have me talk.  We all slaves.  What?  We all slaves.  Shut up.  And y'all ain't experienced nothing right here but a moment from a movie out of glory.  Yeah.  Kanye's a slave.  Back in the day, the slaves had enough money they could body.  You know, that was the moment where Morgan Freeman slapped Denzel in the face. 
[01:08:30]  Yes.  You want to call him a glory?  That's the moment.  Irrational idiot gets slapped in the face.  Oh, was that great?  Yeah.  That was a good movie.  This is not a guy, even though he knows the value of it, he's a fucking hateable motherfucker.  He's talented.  And I know he's talented.  He's not like.  But he's a hateable fucking guy.  It's amazing that he has a fan base.  Yeah, but it's not a fact.  Like, his sales are sold out.  I know.  They're through the roof.  I get it.  His sales are through the roof.  People are, as long as he's, this is keeping him relevant.  But this thing that he wants to do, he can't do.  But Jay-Z doesn't do this, and he's relevant. 
[01:09:00]  This thing he wants to do, this fashion thing or whatever, there's something about him that's  so fucking hateable that he, people go to see his shows, but I guess that's not enough  because Nike is in bed with people.  They don't give a fuck.  How come people are giving him a hard time about this?  If he's such a talented designer.  Because he's hard to work with.  He's probably hard to work with.  That's all it is.  Jimmy, we all slaves here.  We all, we all slaves.  I know.  Why don't you come up with that victim mentality?  Yes, yes.  Oh, I think he is a slave, this guy.  He has to go on late at Bonnaroo.  Oh, you don't know, Carl. 
[01:09:30]  A slave to fashion.  He looks like Kevin Hart, too.  What are the Red Octobers about?  His shoes he designed.  So aren't they more valuable because no one will put them in their stores?  You can't get them.  Damn.  No one's shooting each other online to buy them?  You can't buy them.  A gunfire?  They will eventually.  A gunfire sells everything.  Yo, run me them sneakers.  Yeah.  Run me them Red Octobers, kid.  Yo, run your pockets.  And then what happens when you buy the Red Octobers?  You look fucking awesome.  Run me them Reds, kid. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  You're only allowed to wear them once, I think.  Run me them Reds.  Yeah.  What happens with the sneakers, though?  Why do they only wear them once?  Why?  Patrice would wear sneakers one time.  Yes.  Yeah.  There's a word that describes that.  Yeah.  I don't understand that culture.  Well, yeah.  Why would you buy an awesome pair of sneakers and then wear them once?  It's called temporarily wealthy.  Yes.  Yes.  Temporary.  Well.  Temporary.  But then what happens to the sneakers?  That ain't the term.  Oh, boy. 
[01:10:30]  Chip has a long history.  Yeah.  My mother would say it.  Yeah.  Sam, explain that.  Explain the culture.  You buy these amazing sneakers, maybe wear them once, and then what happens to the sneakers?  You got to throw them away?  Why Sam?  Because he's a red bone?  He is a red bone.  Well, the red bone.  No.  You just save them.  For what?  Or you sell them.  Yeah.  That's stupid.  Why would you wait online to wear sneakers one time?  Like you collect anything.  And then put them in a closet.  Sam looks like the pretty girl in every Spike Lee movie.  Oh, God. 
[01:11:00]  Let's hear more swaying Kanye.  We all say we slaves to Nike.  We slaves to Benz.  We slaves to public perception.  We slaves to not looking.  You know what somebody's going to say after the interview?  Why you let Kanye do that?  You should have checked him.  I don't give a fuck.  I love you, man.  I'm sorry.  I love you, man.  I'm sorry.  Okay?  That's fine.  That's fine.  But look at this.  This is exactly what would happen at the French Revolution.  This is exactly what happened.  I'm sure there's some arguments with Harry Tubman and other people talking about, let's  go this way.  Let's go that way.  The Underground Railroad. 
[01:11:30]  What I'm trying to say is, I sat in Paris and met with these people.  I invested my own money and lost money.  Oh, shit.  I made T-shirts that made money.  I made music that made money.  But at the end of the day, Lucy and Grange still cut my music checks.  As powerful as my voice is, Lucien still runs 50% of the music industry.  Okay.  Francois Pinot owns Balenciaga, Puma, St. Laurent, Stella McCartney. 
[01:12:00]  Francois Arnault owns Louis Vuitton, Celine, Givenchy.  Renzo Rosso owns Margiela, Diesel, Marnie, Victor and Roll.  These guys got factories.  These guys have factories.  What is he talking about?  They run that.  Those guys started from nothing. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  Somewhere in their lives, they were not...  They started from the bottom.  You got enough money to do your own shit.  Stop you fucking sniveling.  Shut up.  Is he ever happy?  No.  He's always like this.  He's a cunt.  The guy's a cunt.  Oh, this just makes me have to take a shit.  What happened?  What are you doing?  Working bacon.  All the bacon.  He's got to go shit.  I hope you shit your pants.  I hope you fucking...  I hope you trip on a piece of rug and shit your pants.  Oh, I know.  I had to sit.  I got a big gas bubble. 
[01:13:00]  I think it's really weird when he has to go to the bathroom.  It's hilarious.  Look, he's like a little kid.  It's a shame I'm pulling out there.  He's all embarrassed and ashamed.  When he was a boy, when he had to get naked in front of the other boys, his big fat guinea  dong would fall out.  Everybody would stare.  A giant guinea dong.  But you see how embarrassed he gets?  Yeah.  During the show, if me or Jimmy have to go to the bathroom, we just get up and go.  It don't matter.  But it's the whole thing with him.  He's ashamed.  I'll spread my asshole.  It's a shame that people are realizing he might have to make duties. 
[01:13:30]  It's your duty.  He's embarrassed.  He's embarrassed.  Cocky duty.  Yeah.  What?  I was saying, I don't understand.  Around strangers, I'm like that.  But my guy friends, I don't give a fuck if they don't have to shit.  No, I don't give a fuck.  I'll shit anywhere, man.  I don't give a fuck.  Me and you, back to back.  What do they say?  Everybody poops.  Yeah, some people act like it doesn't stink.  Oh, yeah.  My mother would say that.  I don't understand the people that can only shit at home.  That's stupid.  There's so many fucking toilets everywhere. 
[01:14:00]  You've got to use them all.  I've dated a couple of them.  Fucking beautiful.  I just don't understand why that's the best invention we have.  The toilet?  Yeah.  We're slaves to the toilet.  Yeah.  Do you think we should have upgraded the toilet by now?  Well, at least toilet paper.  Yeah.  I just feel like it's so savage that every time I go to the store, I see toilet paper.  You know what, dude?  You get a bidet, it shoots right in there.  Some people haven't found an answer.  And I have to agree with Dummy on that one.  Fucking Bob's asshole is like a fucking ice socket. 
[01:14:30]  Clean.  I think toilets should be a little higher off the ground at the very least at this point.  No, this is going to be lower.  Why?  They say you have to squat.  Oh, that's why?  It helps you out?  I have a foot thing in my thing.  I told you.  I have a foot thing.  And when I sit, my legs are raised.  I know, Jimmy.  I know.  I shit in the V.  And boy, I tell you, I taper out a beauty.  Well, see that?  That's what they say.  That's the natural shit technique.  That's right.  If you look at a monkey, that's a...  What about the countries that just have the hole?  The hole, and then you've got to squat over the hole. 
[01:15:00]  But that's probably the best way to shit in the end.  I don't know, yeah.  But doesn't that throw out...  Yeah, the sides get a little caked.  Doesn't it throw out your back?  I'm wondering about other people's shit just over there, you know?  Yeah.  The other OPP.  Hovering over other people's shit and just adding to the pile.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's really what life is, though.  Yeah.  Fucking college.  It's so true.  Let's listen a little more of this.  Yeah, I want to hear the rest of this.  The thing that compresses me is time versus money. 
[01:15:30]  Integrity, money, and relevance.  Because as I work on clothing more, I'm not rapping as much.  So I'm not in the middle of that future mix because I didn't do that feature.  I'm not rapping as much.  I'm not having as much finances.  I'm losing relevancy.  The relevancy is part of my power that allows my brand to be big.  Isn't he just being unreasonable?  Shouldn't he just find investors? 
[01:16:00]  If he has all these great ideas and great products, why doesn't he just find investors?  The whole thing is that...  That's what other people do.  Nobody knows what he's talking about because nobody knows how the fashion industry works  because nobody cares.  Right.  So there is no argument to be had because he can always just say, you don't know how it  works.  But there's not many people that just do it all by themselves.  They find investors in other people.  Yeah, but he shows up and invests in me and he says, you happened like that?  They walk away and I'm not investing in this asshole.  They're like, fuck this guy.  Yeah, who wants to deal with this fucking baby? 
[01:16:30]  You're right.  Yeah, I mean...  Does it get heated again or is it just babbling?  No, it starts to cool down now.  All right, fuck it then.  Yeah, Sway, fuck it.  That's how a lot of those guys are.  Fucking Sway just raised his voice a little and he fucking...  Ugh.  Good for Sway.  Good for Sway.  Yeah.  Are we on a break?  What are you eating?  Yeah, what are you eating, Colin? 
[01:17:00]  Ah, protein energy.  Ah, just goddamn protein bars.  Those are the best.  Don't worry, I'm still ready for breakfast.  You know what?  I don't like the fact that I came and you guys were all finished up eating.  Yeah.  That idiot had his bacon, you had your stupid oatmeal.  No, and still got his sandwich over there.  What are your blueberries, blue boy?  I don't eat them much anymore.  I'm eating...  My favorite things ever is all the Photoshop.  Of blueberries with Norton.  That's a good one.  Why don't you eat blueberries anymore?  What's the problem with blueberries?  They're out of season. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, yeah.  They get a little sour.  I'm not eating as much fruit in the morning because of the...  I mean, I'm eating oatmeal and I'm having a few almonds and a little bit of avocado and  some egg whites.  They call the almonds a diet of trend.  They do.  His new thing is avocado.  Really?  He's really with avocado, yeah.  A little fat in the morning.  Within the last week or two.  Yeah.  It's all about the avocados.  You like guacamole?  Oh, who doesn't?  Good point.  Good point is right.  I love a good guac, as I say.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Colin Quinn is here.  We might have your...  No, I heard he's coming in.  Your road partner. 
[01:18:00]  He was on Twitter this morning.  He was leaving at 6 a.m.  Actually, he's already here.  He's just hanging out in the back office.  We've got to discuss the road trip.  We just need a little time to get our heads together.  All I asked yesterday, I don't know if you heard it after you hung up.  I'm like, if you're doing this road trip with Colin all the way to L.A., you need something  to do in every state.  So I go, what would you do in Jersey?  Basically, the first state you're going to be in.  He goes, well, I don't...  I didn't think of that state yet.  I didn't think of that state yet.  I didn't think that far in advance.  Yeah, but I mean, he is getting a lot of pressure to come up with the... 
[01:18:30]  You know, he has to, like, line produce the whole thing.  He's getting the money.  He's got to be creatively...  It's a lot of work.  I mean, I know what I would do in Jersey.  We go do the Sopranos route.  We drive on the Sopranos route with the music behind us.  Perfect.  See?  Perfect.  You know?  We do a scene from the Sopranos outside that deli.  How about you just redo the open to the Sopranos?  Yeah.  That'd be hilarious.  I'll tell you.  Same exact shots.  We just ask you which is rude every Friday at 6.30. 
[01:19:00]  All right, we're going to break.  Ant should be done with his shit.  Colin Quinn's here.  You're playing Bayshore tonight or tomorrow?  No, Saturday.  Oh, Saturday.  I keep thinking today's Friday because it's this weird fucking Thanksgiving week.  Saturday at the Bayshore Theater.  You've got to go see Colin Quinn on Constitutional, right?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll be back.  After these messages, the OPNN show will be right back.  The OPNNN show continues. 
[01:19:30]  Colin Quinn in studio.  Yeah.  Day before Thanksgiving.  Yeah.  I call it Turkey Day.  What does someone like Colin Quinn do for Thanksgiving?  I go to Brooklyn and play the knockout game.  Are you traditional?  Do you get together with family?  Yes, I get together with family.  Nice.  My cousins, my family.  Right.  Mother.  We have a nice turkey and play a little football with the nephews. 
[01:20:00]  Basic shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Looking forward to it?  Sure.  Not really, right?  That's what people are supposed to say.  Yes.  You're supposed to say that you're looking forward to spending the holidays with the family.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little downtime, eh?  Good food, good times.  Exactly.  With friends and family.  That was almost Edgar.  That was me.  That was Jimmy.  I like turkey.  That's Edgar. 
[01:20:30]  Here we go.  Let's invite Bobo in the studio.  Bobo's here.  Well, yeah, he's here.  He brought some donuts.  Oh my God, why is he running?  Look how he runs.  He runs like my little sister used to run.  Yeah, he runs like a real.  Donuts.  I want a donut call.  How about you?  We'll see what Danny Boy...  We'll see what Danny Boy...  Oh.  Hey, what's up?  Good to see you.  Where's the fucking donuts?  Happy Thanksgiving calling.  YouTube.  Where's the donuts? 
[01:21:00]  Bobo, where's the donuts?  Go get the donuts.  Go get the donuts.  I don't want the kid dropping of a heart attack.  He's moving the good clip.  Look at him running.  Now they're making him run back down the hall.  I didn't make him run.  He's running to get the donuts.  He brought donuts.  He's moving a nice clip.  He'll be fine.  All right.  He's just getting his dumb donuts.  He's healthy.  He's healthy.  He's very excited about this.  How does he get in?  He takes the F train?  How does he get in in the morning?  How does he get in?  We'll have to ask him.  You need to get up at 5.30 because you're on my Twitter at like 6.30. 
[01:21:30]  I'm on my way.  Yeah, yeah.  I saw him at 6.  And he said he had to get his first bus a little over an hour ago.  You said he's in shape.  He's completely out of breath.  Whoa.  What?  There were some people that ate him already.  How many are left?  Time to make the donuts.  There are three of the original 12 left.  You want 12?  Why wouldn't you save the donuts for us?  Oh, Bobo.  Bobo.  Who ate the fucking donuts? 
[01:22:00]  Bobo, you've got to learn politics.  Save the donuts for the important people.  That's not Roland.  Right.  Who ate the donuts?  Who ate the donuts?  Yeah.  E-Rock.  I don't know.  I left them in the-  E-Rock doesn't like sweets.  What?  Who ate 10 of the fucking donuts?  Roland.  Sal.  How many did you buy, Bobo?  Manny, it's Sal.  I bought a dozen donuts.  So we got fucking two left to pick from for all the people in the studio?  That's fucking ridiculous.  You should be mad, Bobo.  Bobo.  Who ate all your donuts?  A disgraceful staff.  You should have watched.  I don't know who ate donuts.  How many did you have, Bobo? 
[01:22:30]  Let's start there.  Troy said he ate two donuts.  How many do you have?  He's selling out Troy.  Troy immediately.  He's like a trustee.  Oh, Troy said.  Bobo always seems like a good idea until, and then he comes in the studio and you realize  it's a horrendous idea.  Yeah, there's two, there's a cruller.  There's no, like, in between.  One that's got weight glue on it and a fucking another one.  A plane.  Donuts suck.  Oh, I like a plane.  Bobo.  How many donuts? 
[01:23:00]  Yes.  Bobo.  Bobo!  How many?  How many donuts did you eat?  Did you eat?  I didn't eat any.  Wow.  Bobo!  Can you talk it to the microphone?  Yeah, you're talking off mic.  It was for everyone.  How many portions did you have?  How many portions?  Strawberries.  Yeah, they called me old Chewy Dick.  Sal, who ate the donuts?  Exactly.  I hope Fred McMurray throws cum in your face, Sal.  Sorry.  I heard you were out sick yesterday.  Yeah. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  What was wrong with you?  The stomach issues.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What happened, Rod Stewart?  Yeah.  A little too much.  You had a one-day sickness?  I'll go with it.  I'm good now.  One-day tummy ache?  24-hour bug is what they call this.  Is that what it is?  Yes.  Eric, comment?  Iraq, comment?  Yeah, he was out sick.  Oh, shit.  Oh, fucking someone doesn't think you were sick.  Oh, shit.  Who's that by fucking CQ's umbrella?  Sal.  Iraq, you got some... 
[01:24:00]  Sal stepped on my umbrella.  Yeah, I don't like it, Sal.  Iraq, you got some intel?  Well, I don't like it.  That Sal's like the yuppie kid in the Italian Guinea family from New Jersey.  Are you out of place when you get together with your family?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  They all have girlfriends.  I haven't found that special someone.  Jesus.  Fucking nine donuts gone.  Nine fucking donuts.  Put that back off for the fucking machete.  Yes.  Cut them out of those greedy stomachs.  Eric. 
[01:24:30]  Yes.  You got intel out here.  Well, by intel, we mean cancer.  Welcome back, Jim.  Jesus.  Sorry.  So, you know, yesterday we were getting ready and everything, and we found out that Sal's  not coming in.  He's out sick.  Oh, okay.  What time did you call in sick, Sal?  I sent the email maybe like...  I think it was like a quarter to five.  Oh, that's a little late.  That's one of the few hours.  I hear you.  Well, Sonny, they're saying two homosexuals are calling in sick. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  Come on, Sal.  I'm not homosexual.  I'm not homosexual.  I can't...  I don't control what they say.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, what'd you do?  You booked a ticket to Wyoming?  Country you want to see?  Well, fucking Al Pacino screamed at E-Rock on the phone.  Sorry, E-Rock.  Keep going.  I'm glad that you look like his wife.  Go ahead, E-Rock.  You got more on this.  So, you know, Sal's out.  Okay, fine.  Whatever.  And then it kind of dawns on me that something that I witnessed Sal doing the day before that 
[01:25:30]  might have tied into why Sal was not here.  Does it rhyme with muck-a-chock?  What did you witness him doing?  Yes.  Well, went downstairs after the show the other day.  I was going to get lunch, and Sal had to go to Dwayne Reed.  Dwayne Reed?  So, I said, okay, I'll just go with you.  Prescription?  Was he sick?  Was he medicine? 
[01:26:00]  And I started to realize as we're going in there, Sal just kept trying to distance himself.  He didn't want me there while he was going to Dwayne Reed.  Oh, no.  The old A-Z-T pickup.  Oh, no.  I hear you.  He had to buy poppers.  So, he said he's just picking up a couple of things for his apartment.  So, nothing out of the ordinary.  Toothbrush, body soap, other things like that.  Body wash.  Axe body with body spray.  And glue-on fist for his chair. 
[01:26:30]  What the fuck?  You get that at Dwayne Reed, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I didn't know that.  They've expanded.  They're called backscratchers, but it even says it in quotes in Dwayne Reed.  Oh, my God.  So, I'm thinking we're done, and he's walking around, and now I can't find him anywhere.  And then, finally, I find him.  I said, where do you go?  He's looking for something.  Where is he hiding by the Diet Piffles?  I'm sorry.  I don't believe that.  I apologize. 
[01:27:00]  I apologize.  Three times in this story.  You're right.  I apologize.  Oh, my God.  So, finally, he admits that he's looking for condoms.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What flavor?  Sick of laborious.  All right.  Did they buy him?  Do they buy him?  Do they buy him?  Do they buy him?  Do they buy him?  Oh, yeah.  He picked out a box of condoms.  What kind?  He picked up a box of magnums.  Oh! 
[01:27:30]  So, obviously, your date didn't want to bring him?  So, you bought them for him?  Is that what it is?  Black gentleman?  Oh.  Magnums.  We've seen his dick.  He's not a magnum, but he's a regular condom guy.  When did we see his dick?  I don't know.  Didn't we?  When you were getting the oversized?  When he was waxed.  I've been naked in here a few times.  A period of time.  Yeah, he's a decent cock, but I wouldn't say he's magnum.  We didn't see it hard.  I don't think anyone does, apparently.  So, you think you need magnum condoms there, so?  I don't think I need them. 
[01:28:00]  I just prefer the way they feel over the other.  A little baggier?  Yeah.  It's like the other ones make my dick come to a point in front, you know?  Oh, yeah?  I don't like the way that feels.  Like a reservoir tip.  Jousting.  Are you worried it's going to fall off, though?  No.  They sag like pants.  Where you pull them over your balls, too?  Yeah.  He pulls them up like those fucking fishing pants up to his waist.  I quadruple up on them.  Hip waders, yes.  Yeah, he stands in the lake.  So, Sal, it seems like you weren't sick.  No, I was legitimately, like, shitting my brains out yesterday. 
[01:28:30]  Well, the theory of him not being...  Did you get probed up there?  Yeah, right?  The theory of him not being here yesterday really was from Roland, because I made the mistake  of telling Roland the other day, we're in the line getting coffee at Dunkin' Donuts  Roland goes, excuse me a second.  Calls Sal, puts them on speakerphone, and then yells in the middle of the crowded Dunkin'  Donuts, hey, Sal, I heard you had to buy Magnums.  Sal freaked out and hung up.  Oh.  Why'd you be embarrassed by that?  No, I was in the subway.  I could barely hear him. 
[01:29:00]  But all I heard was Magnums.  Uh-huh.  So, who'd you buy the Magnums for?  Yeah.  I like the fact that Roland's idea of a prank is to prank himself by putting it on speaker  while he's online.  It didn't make any sense.  You're right.  It made no sense whatsoever.  And then call up...  They were really embarrassed by me yelling in a crowded Dunkin' Donuts and praising his  cock.  Yes.  It's still praise.  No matter how you say it, I hear you buy Magnums as a compliment.  Roland looks at the other people online like, I got him good, huh?  Yeah, he's got a giant cock.  This idiot.  Now, Sal, the big question is, why'd you buy the condoms and were you using them? 
[01:29:30]  Were you successful, yeah.  Were you using them?  Yes, yes.  Oh.  Who was this person?  It's this girl that I'm seeing.  I'm not dating her.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Seeing but not dating.  Casually seeing each other.  Do you like the beard that you have?  No.  I fucking hate the beard.  Why do you have a beard?  What's wrong with your beard?  Because she likes it.  But I thought you just seen her.  No, she is one.  I thought you said...  Oh, yes.  You grew a beard for a chick? 
[01:30:00]  That you're just...  Chick steak, mate.  That you're just seeing, not dating.  Yeah.  That's true.  But why?  Is she like a hipster lover?  Does she like G.I. Joe?  I really don't know.  She just likes it.  That's all.  Yeah.  You have fucking Larry Fishburne beard.  I don't like it.  It's awful.  She wants to pretend you're not gay, too.  Yeah, is that it?  Man up.  Leave Jeff Tweedy from 1995 alone.  That is.  All right.  We'll go.  So why aren't you dating her?  Um, just because, like, I don't know, the situation's a little weird on her end right 
[01:30:30]  now.  Did she come in the condom?  Oh, yeah.  What's the weird shit?  Yeah, what's the weird part?  Is she taking home?  It's a very complicated...  It's another guy.  It's a very complex situation on her ex.  All right.  We have nothing but time here.  Let's go.  How messy could it be?  Right.  Now, the last time I did this, I got so fucked.  But you're not dating her.  Maybe you shouldn't take days off for fuckfests, and then the questions won't come up.  That's a good point.  That's exactly what you were doing.  I did not see her at all during the day.  So wait.  How complicated...  Is she married? 
[01:31:00]  No, no, no, no.  Okay.  How complicated could it be?  Yeah.  It's like...  It's like...  Tranny?  No.  What?  How old is she?  She's, like, a little bit younger than me, I think.  Uh-huh.  All right.  So...  How old are you?  Is that legal?  I'm 23.  Okay.  Was she 20?  She's got a boyfriend.  She's, like, yeah, around there.  She's probably out getting out of a relationship.  That's what she tells him.  Yeah, I think that's mainly what it is.  That's a good way of saying it.  She's full of shit.  She's cheating on her boyfriend with you.  She's in the relationship.  Don't give him ideas.  There's no girl. 
[01:31:30]  Oh.  Oh.  It's the same shit.  Oh.  Everything Jimmy says, he's going, yeah, it's something like that.  Yeah.  Well, no, that's pretty much what it is.  What is it?  That she's, like, kind of getting out of something.  It's like what Jim said, except for the man.  She's not getting out of something.  Except for the guy, right.  She's saying, what's this kid, Sal, about?  Has he got a career with...  So now she's listening every day.  She's like, I don't know if he's a fucking intern.  I can't figure out what he's doing.  Is he going to go somewhere?  Is this going to be worth my while?  Does she listen?  Um, no.  All right, then.  All right, so let's go. 
[01:32:00]  Here's how that condom got thrown out.  And I love you, Sal.  But Sal was on his hands and knees.  And he fucking...  He had to pinch the tip of it out of the tip of his asshole.  Like the way you fucking pinch your nose when somebody farts.  And he yanked it out.  Oh, my God.  Of his anus.  And it snapped on his fingers, leaving a light coating of shit.  Shit.  And cum.  Shit and jizz.  And lube.  Exactly.  Which is also his screen name at AOL.  I say that with love.  It was covered in silver.  Like Kevin Bacon in JFK.  Playing customers.  I think he was at one of those parties. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  That's funny.  He was eating J. Edgar Hoover's ass.  Well, what do we have here?  Be still my heart.  Mr. Garrison, you're a handsome man.  When did she leave your place?  Monday night.  Monday night.  What time?  It was very, very late.  Then you know she really does have a boyfriend because she was with him all weekend, banging 
[01:33:00]  his brains out that she goes to visit this one.  So where's the stomach thing?  Yeah.  When did that pop up?  Well, we had dinner that night and I became extraordinarily sick throughout that night.  What was your dinner?  You're allowed to take days off.  Why don't you just say you were too tired?  I didn't have to come up with this hot food poisoning.  There are many days I come in here that I've pulled an all-nighter or whatever.  I just do it.  It's fine.  I can tell you can't sit down.  How bad was the food poisoning?  I mean, she really likes pizza and she likes buffalo pizza with buffalo sauce. 
[01:33:30]  I fucking hated it.  I ate it and I was just shitting my brain.  You're just doing everything.  Why don't you get your own slice?  Thank you.  You're growing a beard.  This is getting buffalo pizza.  Half and half.  New York has every fucking slice you can imagine.  You eat the buffalo.  He's such a liar.  I love it.  What the fuck does that mean?  I don't believe any of this.  He's got buffalo sauce on her, buffalo wing meat.  And a piece of chicken.  She's a vegetarian, so it has no chicken on it.  So what does buffalo mean?  This chick sounds great.  Makes you grow a beard, gets shitty pizza, and she's a vegetarian. 
[01:34:00]  He's already pussy whipped if she exists.  Roland.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  True.  Roland.  You got anything on this?  I went out with a vegetarian for a long time and here's what happens.  You go to a restaurant.  There's nothing they could fucking get.  And then if you dare suggest something, they're like, I know what I can get and can't get.  So fuck the vegetarians.  Fuck them in their fucking ass.  Then they get mad at you because you're eating properly.  Yeah, exactly.  Fuck them in their leafy shitholes.  Exactly.  Their fucking rabbit pellet shits coming out.  Speaking of vegetarians, Roland, how many donuts did you have? 
[01:34:30]  None.  None.  I don't eat pedestrian donuts.  Who ate all the donuts then?  Roland goes fancy with his snack.  Bobo sold out fucking Troy Kwan, said that he ate two.  That leaves three for five.  Let me ask Roland about the, why wouldn't you eat those donuts?  Pedestrian donuts.  They're called pedestrian donuts?  So where would you get a proper donut in New York City?  Either a planet donut or dough donut.  See?  He knows.  Planet donut.  What is this? 
[01:35:00]  The Simpsons?  Oh, God.  They have to be cake for Roland to eat them.  How are the cookies from Amy's bread?  They wouldn't even hook me up with a fucking making me a late cake.  We'd be all nice to them and they won't help us out.  But I ordered a bunch of cookies.  They're delicious.  Do you think Sal was sick yesterday?  Probably.  Do you think Sal was sick yesterday?  He could be.  Do you think Sal was sick yesterday?  Who helped with Kanye?  I think he was sick.  You think he was sick?  Wow, why are you protecting Sal?  Yeah, right.  You're protecting your boy.  Yeah, you got the pussy. 
[01:35:30]  Travis, you got something to add?  You ran in here.  No, I want to cop to my donuts.  Oh, how many donuts?  All right, you had two.  Troy had two.  So that leaves seven.  I had two.  Nine.  That's six gone.  There's three donuts left.  Three missing.  That are missing.  I had one.  Two donuts left.  Two missing donuts.  Bobo.  Mars or something.  Mars?  Yeah, Mars probably did.  It's free.  Yeah.  Probably wearing them on his fucking heels to protect his feet. 
[01:36:00]  I'll feed my family for you.  Sal, did you call the girl that you're seeing to see which flavor donut you could eat?  No.  Oh.  Fuck.  Pussy whip.  Yeah, why would you eat her pizza?  I don't know.  I just don't want to make her feel uncomfortable, you know?  You get it by the slice.  Why is that uncomfortable?  Yeah, if you didn't get a full pie.  No, I did buy a full pie.  It was stupid of me.  There's two of you.  You buy half buffalo and half plain.  How easily damaged is she if you're like, I don't like buffalo and pizza.  What an emotional wreck.  Oh, she starts crying.  Talking about her sex abuse at fucking six. 
[01:36:30]  Right.  I was a mess.  Belested by a man who had buffalo and sauce on his fingers.  I messed it.  What?  I messed it.  It depends what's a pizzeria, though, too.  What?  It depends what's a pizzeria.  Some makes really good.  You don't need pedestrian pizza, right?  Fuck no.  Where do you get your pizza?  Where's a good pizza?  I got Ruby Rosa.  I want to go to the place that you want in Connecticut.  Planet Pizza?  Is there a Planet Pizza?  Probably.  It should be.  What else?  Ruby Rosa.  I don't know.  Ruby Rosa is good.  It is delicious.  It's like Tim Sabian went on to it. 
[01:37:00]  You want me to believe it's good pizza because Ruby Rosa sucks it so much?  You bought that lie.  I sent Tim Sabian down.  He went like four days in a row.  He loved it.  Where is this place?  Mulberry Street, 235.  It's delicious.  So you go all the way there just to get your pizza?  Yes.  How about Ray's?  Original Ray's?  Famous Ray's.  Not around this place.  Regular Ray's?  Original Ray's?  Legendary Ray's?  There's so many people there.  You'll never get a movie.  All right.  Well, welcome back to Sal. 
[01:37:30]  We're not getting much out of him today.  Yeah.  Sal's clammed up.  In time, hopefully, I can give you guys more details.  Yeah?  What's the details that you can't give us?  Well, like I really want to date this chick at some point.  No.  Oh.  Well, wait a minute.  If you're fucking her, how could you then, like, you can't date her?  And she's already telling you what to do.  She's got a boyfriend.  Yeah, okay.  Do their pussies think?  No.  No.  Is it me?  Oh, look at him.  That's love.  No.  No.  Oh, my God.  No.  No.  She's seeing somebody.  She's trying to make a decision based on his status here at the show. 
[01:38:00]  But if you're scared to order your own pizza, you're going to have major fun.  See, look at all the guys that are relationships.  They know.  Between two lovers, feeling like a fool, loving both of you is breaking all the rules.  Soaring between two lovers.  Yeah.  Moeen Montgomery.  You can't figure out pizza.  Holy fuck.  Good luck to you.  Maybe she's here.  Maybe she works here.  Oh.  Does she work here?  Does she work here?  Oh.  No.  Maybe she's a stripper.  I'm never, ever doing that again, because last time that happened, that girl won't even 
[01:38:30]  You couldn't come.  She won't even fucking look at me anymore.  Well, good.  Because you couldn't come.  She's a dud.  Who cares?  You fucking insulted her with your fucking non-coming dick.  Yeah, I know.  Like, I tried reaching out to that girl a few times, like, shooting her texts, like,  Hey, you know, I feel, like, horrible about the situation.  She won't even fucking respond.  Why would she?  You're not missing anything.  Good for you.  Oh, wow.  You didn't like her?  She sounds like a healthy person.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Get re-involved with some guy that couldn't even get up for her?  Yeah, right?  Fuck that.  You've got to set the precedent now, though.  You can't, before you even start officially dating, be growing facial hair for her and eating 
[01:39:00]  her pizza.  Eating her pizza.  She'll fall apart if you order a regular slice.  What do you mean?  He's already fucking, obviously, he's doing something right.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, that's why.  That was the final deciding thing.  Magnum condom.  I'll let you fuck me, but you gotta...  Do you let her know they're magnum?  You're like, excuse me while I put on this magnum condom.  Does she want to know why you're stuffing newspapers in it?  Like, fucking shoes are too big.  Like, homeless people's socks.  You just shove newspapers around it.  Oh, that's great.  Look, I don't think I have a big dick.  I just prefer the way that feels. 
[01:39:30]  You are one.  Oh, shit.  All right, Sal.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Where's more donuts?  Where's Bobo?  Stepping in the way of Bobo, who...  Bobo, this is your time.  What are you doing?  Sally ain't eating up your time there, Bob.  I actually figured out some stuff for some of the states.  Cool.  All right, that's good.  I'm right back to it without missing a beat.  I love it.  Without a fucking hint of real human contact.  That's how business gets done.  He's focused.  Well, we asked him to get some things done.  Well, first of all, he had a good suggestion on Twitter. 
[01:40:00]  He should get a girl in each state to show her tits when we drive by.  That's great, right?  That's not a bad idea.  Then he could talk about, like, what state had the best tits.  Yes.  Yeah.  That's actually part of the trip.  Oh.  Bobo.  I'm actually going to figure that out based on...  We're actually going to view the photos.  Oh, my God.  He just...  Thank you.  You do know you can lower that mic, right?  He's an idiot.  Yeah.  He's fucking standing like Lemmy, singing up into it.  Yeah, Lemmy.  But also, for example, one of the states, Pennsylvania, we could head into this... 
[01:40:30]  Got one of Lemmy's moles for a brain.  ...head into this area called Intercourse, an Amish community.  One of those fucking...  You could actually visit an Amish community.  Sugar pops on his face.  What about that?  What?  An Amish community.  Ah, an Amish community.  That's great.  Intercourse.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, they're in it.  That is actually a double meaning by that.  Intercourse, Pennsylvania.  And the Amish live there.  I have a shirt that says that.  It's really funny.  Oh, that is hilarious.  Intercourse, all I got was just louser.  Oh, boy.  So what are you going to do with the Amish? 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  You can't just go there.  You've got to have, like, a thing to do.  That's what reality shows do.  They participate in a barn raising.  We get, like, a horse and buggy.  We drive around in that.  Churn some butter.  Yeah, I guess we could do one of the things on the...  One of the jobs that they do on the farm there.  That's true.  Uh-huh.  What kind of jobs do they do?  They should live in a puppy mill.  Well, I guess one of the things they do there, I guess they have to churn the butter.  Right.  Wow, where did you get that idea from?  Colin just said that.  No, I actually...  Oh, I said it.  But I kind of thought... 
[01:41:30]  No one said it.  I did thought that when they figured out the Amish community...  Uh-huh.  But come up with your own Amish thing.  Exactly.  We came up with the churn the butter thing.  I guess one of the things they could make me and Colin attempt to milk a cow.  Oh, shit.  All right.  That could be funny, Colin.  You got to...  That is good.  I could picture...  What is this?  This one or the other one?  You know, that would be great.  Good comedy fodder there.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Louis Pasteur.  And then Bobo could be like...  It just counts as those tits, huh?  You could give, like, little science facts. 
[01:42:00]  The cow has multiple stomachs and chews its cud.  You know?  And the interesting thing also, we could have a little...  Or that.  We could have Bobo and Colin commentary on each of the states we pass by.  That's good to just take the idea that we were discussing and plow over it into a non-idea.  It's a great strategy.  We found a clear road to drive on, and you turn directly into a lake.  Yeah.  Bobo, don't pay them any mind.  Oh, Bobo.  Continue.  I also figured out in the... 
[01:42:30]  Of course.  When we go through Chicago...  Oh.  One of the things we could do is have me and Colin eat at that place, that restaurant where  they screw you over, I guess, where the waiters are rude to the customer.  Yeah.  What?  Shea Louis?  That was called?  I don't know.  That was from fucking...  Shea Baby?  I don't know.  I don't know the name of the place.  I just heard that there was a place like that.  Are you going to be funny?  Yeah, I know the place you mean.  They were going to deliver food to our live event, but they felt that it wouldn't be weird. 
[01:43:00]  They were rude out of it.  It would look stupid, and they were right.  We would have murdered them.  Oh, we would have killed them.  It's got to be in context.  What is it?  Dicks or something?  But he's not talking about that.  Yeah, yeah.  He said, we go to that restaurant.  Dirty dicks.  Dirty dicks or something.  That's what they do.  But it's so put up.  Can I have a hot dog?  Hey, what are you, a bum?  Give me a fucking hot dog, and I'll put it down like a happy lamb.  Yes, for the heck.  We insult them back.  Really?  We insult them back.  I'll turn this into a Texas Stucky's.  I went to Crazy Country Club. 
[01:43:30]  You ever go to that one?  No.  Are you saying it gets old really fast when they insult you?  You think that gets old really fast?  I would assume really fast.  Yeah.  You think they drop the plates on the table?  Ah, here.  And they just shove them at you?  Like, oh, that's cute.  Oh, this is fun, everyone.  Thanks.  I'm sure they have a system.  It can't be over that long if they're not doing something right.  That's true.  Pubs.  And, of course, the other suggestion I suggested in Chicago also go into one of those glass boxes  in the Sears Tower.  Yeah.  And that's it? 
[01:44:00]  To do what in them?  Yeah, what are you going to do in it?  Hopefully we jump up or down.  I don't know.  I guess we say whatever comments are said when we're in those glass boxes.  I don't know if Colin has a fear of heights or not.  How about a pine box?  I can.  For the sake of that bit, I can.  Good.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was hoping for that bit.  He does have a fear of heights because it'd be interesting to see what Colin would be saying  about it.  I could manufacture it if I didn't have it to me and you.  Good thing. 
[01:44:30]  For the sake of the bit.  It is scary.  So you've got Chicago covered.  That's good.  Even though we're not going anywhere near Chicago, it's way out of the way if you're going to  L.A.  Well, it's along the route to L.A.  I think so.  Oh, where's Route 66?  Oh, you should get your kicks on Route 66.  Yeah.  When we drove during that point of the road trip, we'll drive along the Route 66 route.  Yeah.  Along the Route 66 route.  Yeah.  Sorry.  And what else are you planning? 
[01:45:00]  So you've got Chicago covered.  Yeah.  That sounds entertaining.  I also thought of the Detroit, the abandoned buildings.  Oh.  What are you going to do there?  Did you see that in the Sunday Times, that whole thing on it?  Oh, yeah.  We explored the abandoned buildings with maybe someone who does expeditions and abandoned  buildings?  How about that, Carl?  I don't know about that.  It sounds like we're prime candidates for the knockout game if we do that.  Yeah, the knockout game could happen. 
[01:45:30]  Detroit is one big knockout.  When they play the knockout game, it's a knockout game.  And an abandoned factory.  Yeah.  Sounds dangerous.  But I understand what you say, but maybe we shouldn't be going to the traditional place.  Maybe we need to go to other cities like Grand Rapids.  Oh.  Why does it always have to be Chicago and Detroit?  Yeah, maybe we could head into some obscure place in Grand Rapids.  Yes.  That's a good idea.  I see.  Look at that.  He came up with, oh, that's right.  What kind of obscure place?  I haven't looked up Grand Rapids yet, but if there's some obscure places there, we could 
[01:46:00]  visit one of those obscure places.  Oh, I'm sure there's plenty.  Yeah, the whole place is obscure.  How about Wall Drug, South Dakota?  What's that?  It's one of those.  We get drugs off the wall, fucking piece of garbage.  That fits in with Intercourse Pennsylvania.  Yes.  How about we go to a funny named town in each state?  That would be good.  Yeah, like Peckaville.  Yeah, that'd be interesting.  We could do that.  Uh-huh.  Also, I suggested the really obscure tourist traps along the route. 
[01:46:30]  Like?  Like?  Like?  Yeah.  I'm not sure all the obscure tourist traps there are on the route.  All right, name one.  I'll give you, for instance, I just visited on my trip when I was in New Hampshire a couple  weeks ago doing the show.  I had to drive to Albany, and we stopped.  It was a museum off the side of a cliff.  Wow.  That was kind of interesting.  That's crazy.  In fact, I sent some pictures of Jim and Richard Waters from that very museum.  They had a couple of live owls.  Like?  Oh, I thought it was like a museum of guys named Cliff. 
[01:47:00]  That was stuffed animals.  That would have been good.  Yeah, that would be good.  Yeah.  Cliff Hoxtable.  Cliff.  Cliff Clavin wing.  Yeah.  Cliff Clavin.  Cliff Clavin.  I don't know.  Well, maybe we should talk about the day we're definitely doing, the test day.  There is a test day coming up.  Absolutely doing a test day.  Now, what is the route?  I don't know.  For this test.  Bobo.  Test trip.  Where to?  A day trip. 
[01:47:30]  Remember, we went someplace that's not that, you know, where we can really stretch out our  legs.  Yeah, yeah.  I was thinking of Suffolk County, Long Island.  That is a good one.  Yep.  That is a good one.  Let's try maybe the bar that maybe has the weird, one of the weirdest kind of people you'd  find.  Like a biker bar?  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Some of the weirdest kind of people you'd find.  In a bar.  In a bar.  In a bar.  Like violent weird or more like just quirky? 
[01:48:00]  Did you catch that?  Yeah.  In a bar.  Can you replay that, E-Rock?  Hold on, Bobo.  In a bar.  In a bar.  I didn't like your fucking smooth, sexy, cigarette head voice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was sultry.  He always brings it down.  But he just did it in a bar.  He likes bringing it down.  Yeah.  I guess we could also try the weird, quirky bar and a biker bar.  I like it.  What's a weird, quirky bar?  How are you going to find this?  Yeah, that's true.  Like what kind of bar?  Well, if it's near a certain type of business, I can see what you're saying.  Like if you're by a hospital, maybe there's a bar that opens early in the morning because 
[01:48:30]  hospital workers are up all night.  Maybe there's a bar by the nuclear, by the...  Oh, by Shoreham?  Yeah.  By Shoreham.  It's for nuclear workers.  By the collider?  Yeah, where everybody has like a weird ear or strange eyes.  Conk?  Yeah.  The conk.  By the lake.  Anything by the conk is going to be a little weird.  That's good.  You can be lakeside, maybe?  Another thing I figured that would be good for the road trip.  I remember this one...  We're working on the day trip. 
[01:49:00]  Jimmy's exasperated.  This is the day trip idea.  I remember this one obscure restaurant out in Long Island, out in the Smithtown.  They serve shotgun shells.  For some weird reason, the place kind of freaked me out because it seemed all cow decor.  Oh, what?  Like, the whole decor of the restaurant was all cows.  Oh, my God.  That can be funny.  In Smithtown, too.  In Smithtown, right on Main Street?  We don't have to go too far.  Is it by the Big Bull? 
[01:49:30]  Is it frogs?  I just know the restaurant's called Murray's Kitchen.  Murray's Kitchen?  I think it's Murray's Kitchen.  Murray's.  Well, that's a big difference.  Murray and Marie, it's two different things.  The odd couple would have been very odd.  I bet it's a steakhouse.  You think it is?  Yeah.  What do they have in this place?  Bo-bo?  Cows.  The entire decor was cows.  Cows.  Yeah, yeah.  Cows.  Cows.  I hate how you say cows. 
[01:50:00]  Cows.  I think I remember the seats was like cow print.  I threw it.  Yeah, cow print seats.  Cow print seats.  Okay.  Yeah, I think the whole seat.  There was even a freaking motorcycle that was on display was like cow print.  Oh.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, wow.  This place looks wonderful.  It looks like a cafeteria.  What do we say?  It's a fucking cafeteria.  Oh my God.  There's cows.  This is the worst looking place ever.  What a shit road trip. 
[01:50:30]  It's not a shit road trip.  There's no thing.  It's literally a big, bright cafeteria.  There's no cows in there, really.  There's cow prints in the boots.  That's it.  Where are the rest of the cows?  There's cow wallpaper.  There is?  Okay.  And there looks to be some cow figurines.  All right.  Like cow salt and pepper shakers, maybe.  But then some of the tables don't have cow.  I know.  You see, it's like a half cow section, half, like for people that don't want cow.  They don't want to deal with the cow.  They're talking in code.  You walk in, they go cow or no cow. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  Cow or no cow.  Let me hear your second cow themed fucking trip idea.  Let's go milk a cow.  Let's go to a place that's a good feeling of cows.  Cows.  Where are all the cows, Bobo?  But I do have an idea, but I want to talk to Opie about it.  I don't want to ruin it for the audience if we do film this.  Okay.  Yeah.  It's not really an up.  It's low concept.  Bobo, the way I like to work is.  Low concept.  Yeah.  I'm not thinking in terms of like, oh, we have to find this place, the world's biggest 
[01:51:30]  ball of yarn and stuff like that.  Yeah.  I think sometimes just human interaction that we could probably have.  Oh, that's true.  Is really what this show is going to be about.  That's what it's all about.  And then hopefully we'll run into some characters or whatever.  We go to the gas station.  We stop in, you know, Smithtown or whatever.  A little slice of Americana.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm feeling it.  Is that what it looks like from the outside?  Cow outside.  That's the outside.  That doesn't look like Smithtown at all to me, boy.  That looks like Smithtown, sure.  Jesus.  Oh, look at that.  Big cow.  Little Smithtown. 
[01:52:00]  Anything else, Bobo?  What about where else in Long Island?  Well, maybe some.  Can we see the menu for Maureen's Kitchen?  Yeah, absolutely.  I want to see if they have cow themes.  Everything's got milk in it.  Milk and stream beans.  I told you about the time we were making out with a girl in Smithtown.  A father came out and said, smash my friend's call with a bat.  Wow.  They don't play.  They don't play in Smithtown.  No, no, no.  He came out in a white t-shirt.  It was like 1981. 
[01:52:30]  That motherfucker.  You know what he's thinking?  He was 100% right.  He's like, I'm trying to raise my fucking family.  I come out to Smithtown, which is a nice fucking place.  And you're trying to put your fucking white trashy shit.  Yeah.  You're trying to double duty by doing it.  Right out in front of his house.  He came out there and just started smashing.  Not even like, what are you doing?  Yeah.  Just right out.  And she was obviously used to it.  Daddy!  She started screaming to me.  Oh, God.  Here we go again.  Here we go again.  Oh, God.  So did he hit anybody with the bat? 
[01:53:00]  No, he drove away.  Yeah, of course.  I went with a girl from Smithtown, too, and her father was a real fucking prick on wheels.  He really was an asshole.  He was a prick when he is.  He called me my fine-feathered friend.  He goes, listen to me, my fine-feathered friend.  Did he watch TV and just use that?  Oh, it was great.  He was very angry with me because I was telling people that I was going to go visit his daughter  in college when she went to Quinnipiac College in Connecticut.  I was going to go take the drive up. 
[01:53:30]  And I told a couple of people at the bar my mom worked at, the Inn at the Crossroads,  where Jericho and fucking Vets split.  It's a tit bar now.  And I told some people that it got back to him that I was going to go and see the daughter.  He sat me down and gave me a talking to that people will be telling stories.  And listen to me, my fine-feathered friend.  And I'm just sitting there going, what the fuck?  I'm just thinking, what does that mean?  Did you go visit her? 
[01:54:00]  Oh, fuck yeah.  I fucked the shit out of her in her dorm room.  Give her some bird dick.  Yes.  That's great.  Exactly.  I stepped on the eggs when they were born.  I got very good news, people.  Very good news.  Oh, shit.  Hi.  Hi.  How's your day?  Oh, my God.  Jim is just taken right out of the game here.  We're happy that you're on the phone.  What do you want?  Hi, Lady Di.  How's everything? 
[01:54:30]  Okay?  Hi.  How are you?  You know what I said?  What did you say?  Why are these people fans of this show?  Marion and I say happy birthday.  Another one that has no awareness.  Marion and her say happy birthday.  Why are you always talking for Marion?  Why can't she talk for herself?  Well, she's working right now.  Oh, well.  Is she over the twerking video yet?  Where she said the N-word?  Oh, don't worry about it.  We almost got her fired.  She's like two years from retirement. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, my God.  She's only a couple years from her pension.  We almost got her fired over dumb twerking video.  That would have been bad.  No, no, no.  I mean, I can't answer for her, but.  What?  What are you talking about?  I cannot answer for her.  But that's the past.  But Lady Di, you direct messaged me and said, is it really you, Colin?  I said, yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  Yeah.  All right.  Just to make sure we know, that is me. 
[01:55:30]  Uh-huh.  Okay, wait.  Wait.  Hold on a second.  Who am I talking to, Sam?  Yes.  Holy shit.  Hopefully the Grim Reaper soon.  Who am I talking to?  Who do you think?  Okay.  All right.  So, yeah, but when I DM somebody, I know exactly who I'm talking to, but I just wanted  to find out because, you know, I can't see you.  I can't even hear you unless I call the show.  So, I mean, I don't have the XM satellite, you know. 
[01:56:00]  We know.  What she's saying is that she can only call the show and hear what's going on if she doesn't  have a satellite.  Right.  Oh.  And then the same problem with DM.  How do you do that?  So, on the phone, you can't tell who you're talking to?  Right.  Well, she doesn't know who's on today.  It's Colin Quinn.  Remember, you DM'd me the other day.  You go, is it really you, Colin?  I go, yes.  Oh, hi, Colin.  Are you in the studio right now?  Yes, where do you think he is?  No, he's in the spaceship at the end of Contact.  Fucking flithering idiot.  Hey, Colin, I love you.  You know that.  I love you, too. 
[01:56:30]  That's nice.  Ah, that's sweet.  Very nice.  Right.  Yeah.  So, what's going on?  Right now, really nothing much.  We're getting all set for Thanksgiving tomorrow.  Oh, yeah?  What are you doing?  What do you have to give thanks for?  What are you going to give thanks for?  A lot of things.  Your father's inheritance that you're piddling away, or the fact that you're living with  a guy that's supporting you?  What?  No.  How does a lady die prepare for Thanksgiving? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Well, we're going to have a turkey.  We're going to have stuffing.  We're going to have mashed potatoes.  And who's cooking all this?  Yeah.  Well, I'm going to help him out.  Help him out?  Oh, I'm sure you're going to help.  How are you going to help out?  How many times are you going to go get back inside?  Sit there and put your fat feet up on the oven, drink cooking, Sherry?  It's defeating its own purpose.  Bring it over.  Drink vanilla extract because you're out of booze.  Fucking booze hound.  You're sitting there boozing it up. 
[01:57:30]  I'm going to do the best I can.  It up.  Well, that's all we have.  Drop this fucking can of cranberry sauce on the floor.  Well, what are you guys doing for Thanksgiving?  Oh, God.  Turn about his fair play, Lady Di.  I've got to ask you, Lady Di, have you popped your first beer yet?  Yeah, I just did.  Oh, what a lush.  It's 8.30 in the morning.  Holy fuck.  I know what time it is.  I know what time it is. 
[01:58:00]  It's 5 o'clock somewhere.  When did you pop the first beer?  Yeah.  I just popped one.  I just popped my first beer.  What are we drinking today?  Well, what do you think I drink?  Natty Ice.  Natty Ice.  Natty Ice.  Come on.  Only the best.  Natty Ice.  You're drinking Natty Ice at this hour.  At 8.30 in the morning.  8.30, Natty Ice.  Why don't you stop it, you fucking lush?  Why don't you get on with things?  Get on with things. 
[01:58:30]  Seriously, I mean.  Like suicide.  No, but get sober and fucking cut the malarkey already.  Not right.  Get a job.  Why don't you have a job?  It might happen for the new year.  Oh, now it might happen for the new year.  Giving yourself all December just to slough off.  Right.  Tell Mary to put in a work here.  Slough off.  Isn't this the time of year where a lot of places hire because they need extra help?  Of course it is.  Yes.  Why don't you start with that shit?  Get a seasonal job.  Get a Christmas store.  Why don't you do that?  Go to the mall.  Seasonal help.  Walk in there and go, look, I'm ready to... 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  Work at Orange Julius.  Right.  No, go to the mall.  There's good jobs out there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what?  That's a good idea.  I just might do that.  Why don't you get a job as the fucking ox that keeps time in the Little Drummer Boy song?  No.  And she goes, no, no.  Like she could have, but no.  No.  Yeah.  Mary can be the lamb.  They kept talking.  Oh, come on.  That must have been one shitty band. 
[01:59:30]  Ox and lamb are keeping time.  They wonder why you pop up in a beat with this kind of abuse, right?  Yeah.  Right.  Listen.  Listen.  What?  We might be up there before Christmas.  All right.  Great.  Mary and I.  Okay.  Well, you guys should.  Oh, God.  Look at the picture of them.  Wow.  We found a little picture of you.  I will let you know.  I will let you...  Wow.  So some big fucking...  Boy, Mary was a fat pig at one point.  She looks better now.  Colin Quinn, Jim Norton, Opie and Anthony, and Bobo and E-Rock right now. 
[02:00:00]  And Eric Nagel in a horrible orange sweat jacket.  God, it's distracting.  You can see with Google Earth.  So you got a lot of people over there.  Google E-Rock.  I'm kidding, E-Rock.  You're fantastic.  Bobo, you got something to say to Lady Di?  I hope you don't plan on passing out if you're sitting in the back...  If one of the back seats are in a road trip, because we would be riding on you.  What?  Wait a minute.  What is this...  Riding on her?  Wait, are we taking Lady Di with us?  That'd be great. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  Why don't you reenact the back seat of fucking the car in the Saturday Night Fever?  Or Reservoir Dogs.  For some reason, she's sitting in the back seat.  She's sitting in the back seat with one of the behind...  With a couple of the behind-the-scenes people that I suggested to call and we invite.  Oh, yes.  Who was it again?  How big is this car?  Right?  Well, just a minivan.  But who was it again?  We're going to bring...  Yeah, who's coming?  It'd be at Timmy30 on Twitter.  When is this going to take place? 
[02:01:00]  Some guy from Milwaukee on Twitter, you fucking yuts.  What's the matter with you?  Be selective.  Why are you taking somebody like that, Bobo?  When is this going to take place?  It's slated for March.  Slated.  I'd like to beat you with a piece of slate.  I'd like to slate you.  It's slated for March.  Slated.  Oh, my God.  He's using Hollywood talk.  Yeah, we're going to green light this one.  We're going to blue sky it.  Yes, blue sky this.  All right, wait. 
[02:01:30]  You guys are getting anxiety over this.  Yeah, yeah.  You guys are freaking out.  Can I ask you something?  Yes.  Go ahead and watch.  All right, is this taking place in the springtime?  He just said March, motherfucker.  When is March?  All right, all right.  That's around springtime.  When is I going to have a job?  Oh, stop it.  Is it going to be on the weekend?  Stop it.  You aren't going to have a job.  Yeah, you're not going to have a job.  Of course you're not going to have a job.  Exactly.  It makes you think you're going to have a job.  You've been talking about having a job for 12 years. 
[02:02:00]  That's really not a very likely epic thing.  Hold on.  Opie, Opie.  I did work a few years back.  No, you didn't.  No, not really.  Yes, I did.  No, you didn't.  It's like a Eugene O'Neill play.  Yes, I did.  Oh, boy.  Oh, God.  Oh, boy.  I worked for a temp agency, and I was also crossing guard for a little bit.  Oh, God.  Exactly.  Drunk crossing guard.  Exactly.  That's wonderful.  What happened?  You had a bottle of booze and heard a thump?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Why were you fired from that? 
[02:02:30]  Why were you fired from that job?  I was not fired.  The kids loved that crossing because they could just kick the natty ice cans across the street  when they walked.  They kicked the natty ice can.  There was a horrible lump and then just a little bloody mitten.  Oh, God.  She had to go.  I would rather not even talk about that.  I could probably get that job back any time I want.  You think?  Well, then how about you get the job back?  Exactly.  Yeah.  Well, let's put it this way.  If I go over and talk to them, maybe I can get the job back. 
[02:03:00]  Then why don't you?  Why don't you?  You need a job.  Without beer under your breath.  Exactly.  You fucking booze hound.  Right.  Booze hound.  We would know about that.  Yeah.  What happened?  Did the kids used to play kick the crossing guard?  Good one.  Whoa, Bobo.  I remember this story.  She was working as a crossing guard and she didn't show up one day.  She fucking fell asleep.  And that's what happened, right, Lady Di?  You have a lot of time in between when you're a crossing guard. 
[02:03:30]  All right.  So what?  Take naps?  The school day.  Lots and lots of time in between.  We understand how it works.  You get them to the school and then you got to get them back.  We know.  So what happens?  Did you get lunch?  So yeah.  Would you have liquid lunch?  Yeah.  Would you have faceplant into a motel bed?  No.  Did the kids play the knockdown game with the crossing guard?  The knockdown game.  The knockdown game.  Oh my God.  Is he useless?  And second of all, no. 
[02:04:00]  No.  She played it.  Yeah.  So now what happened?  She plays the pass out game where she hits her mouth with natty ice cans until she falls  down.  No.  Natty ice.  It's like one step of a meister brow.  What's the matter with you?  What?  What's the matter with me?  It's actually higher class to drink bum urine than what you're drinking.  What's the matter with you?  What's the matter with you?  That's one thing I never did.  I never drank on the job.  Because you get fired too much for not showing up.  You don't have a job. 
[02:04:30]  It's great.  I don't drink on the job.  Yeah, I just sleep through it and they fire me.  Yeah, well, I did take a few days off.  All right.  Why don't we do this?  Let's make it really easy.  I love this.  What are you doing today?  Right.  Today.  What are you doing?  What am I doing today?  That's the question.  That's the question.  I'm kind of nasty out there.  I don't know.  Plus nasty in your apartment too.  What else?  What are you going to do today?  What is your mission for the day?  She's battening down to the store.  Well, you know what?  You know what?  I might apply online again for some jobs.  You're not going to do that. 
[02:05:00]  I might.  You're a lazy lump.  You know, why don't you just go out and get a job?  You're capable.  You're healthy.  What's the matter with you?  Okay.  Well, thank you very much.  I've been telling you this for years.  Go out and get a job and get your life together.  Your criteria for health is right.  It is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's going to sit home over a couple of night.  I just put on some Jimmy Buffett and relax.  And watch the monkeys.  Oh, yes.  She likes the monkeys.  The monkeys are not on the air anymore.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  Since 1967. 
[02:05:30]  We know what to get you for Christmas.  Yes.  They took them off the air and they put on other shows like that.  What's it on YouTube?  I Dream of Jeannie and...  Oh.  You can Netflix that shit.  What about YouTube?  Yeah.  Go to YouTube.  YouTube.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I usually do.  What's your favorite monkey song?  I like Alva Believer.  You ever hear that one?  My favorite monkey song?  I'm a fan of Valerie.  I like that song.  It's kind of up.  Stepping stone for me.  Actually, I like a lot of them.  But one of my favorite ones is Papa Jean's Blues. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, yeah.  Well, that was Mike...  How did that go?  That was Mike Nesmith doing his real thing, yeah.  Oh, that was when he got mad at everybody and wanted to do his song.  Is this it?  Wait.  Why don't we have her sing it?  Yeah, you sing it, Di.  How's it go?  How's it go, Di?  No heartaches from the long and lonely nights of waiting finally won me.  Happiness is all, though, loving you.  And now with you as inspiration, I look for a destination, sunny, bright, that once before was blue. 
[02:06:30]  I have no more than I did before, but now I've got all that I need.  For I love you and I know you love me.  You want me to go on?  No, you sing like an angel.  And by angel, I mean wounded rhino.  I have no more than I did before, but now I've got all that I need. 
[02:07:00]  For I love you and I know you love me.  Play magic fingers.  That's great.  Oh, God.  Hopefully on a trigger.  She's fucking stumbling around like Mickey Rourke in Barfly alone in her apartment, knocking pots off the fucking stove.  Just singing, toasting, nobody in the room. 
[02:07:30]  Man, my friends.  She's alone.  She's all my friends.  Using the necktie to get the fucking, get the shot glass up to the mouth, like a pulley.  Yeah.  When I drive, when I drive, my truck.  Yeah.  Okay.  What an enchantress you are.  What?  Nothing.  I like to pop in the CD and just sing along with it.  Oh, yeah.  What kind of truck did you have, my dear?  I have a Ford Explorer.  Cool.  Uh-huh.  Great.  All right. 
[02:08:00]  How do you pay your insurance on that thing?  Um, well, actually, I pay for my credit card.  You pay the insurance with your credit card.  Well, how do you pay for the credit card?  I usually be crossing the street.  Oh, God.  That's barreling.  Yeah.  Singing monkey songs.  Just singing monkey songs.  No awareness whatsoever.  Just flying through red lights.  Natty Ice.  Natty Ice blocking the view.  Yeah.  Natty Ice in one. 
[02:08:30]  Just singing a good happy song.  The last memory I know.  Some neurosurgeon did everything right his whole life.  Oh, God.  Some neurosurgeon did everything right his whole life.  Oh, my God.  Exactly where he's supposed to live.  He's trying to see me die.  Yeah, this fucking monster hits him.  So, Huff misses the break.  Oh.  Oh, that's too funny. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's too funny.  What we're dealing with here is a complete lack of respect for the law.  He's just barreling through.  Oh, she plows right her head like a fucking cannonball.  Right into a farmer's market. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, my God.  Hold on, hold on, you babbling sods.  We're doing something.  Who are you tonight?  The Kit Kat one?  Who's just fucking...  Someone's trying to pick out tomatoes here.  Die with her fucking monkeys.  She's laughing.  I love her face.  Somebody like Mother of the Lords.  She's doing everything right now.  Right.  She said I'm going to work with this to break.  I don't know my life.  Yeah.  Happily singing our monkey song.  Give a shot for guys' cock.  Not aware 
[02:10:00]  Any traffic laws  Now all they see is the glint  Of the bottom of the fucking beer can  In the fucking windshield  With a mowed down  Oh, nice  She's like Gandolfini coming home  And having a fucking  Fuck, I give myself the hiccups  Oh, God, that's fucking funny, man  Cops are why did you see the last train of Corksville  Coming out of a ditch  With the wheels still spinning as it's upside down  She's in a tree somewhere 
[02:10:30]  With her natty ice  Of course she doesn't die  Because she was too drunk  No, she's fine  She has a couple of teeth  Oh, my God  That's great  I thought the monkey saw with the car crash  There she is  And she's singing  As she's plowing into people 
[02:11:00]  Down in my, down in my mind  Maybe she  Followed a whole trail of natty ice  To the accident  A whole trail across the Jersey turd bike  That's it  The improv master steps in  I don't  Oh, my God  Is that fucking funny  What?  Maybe we can take the Explorer  For the test  That's not a bad idea  Oh, see, I got hiccups  From that bit  Oh, that was a good one  Oh, God damn it  Are you done, Lady Di?

[02:13:30]  I like the fact  There's the library  Yeah  Like we all live  In the same small town  The library  Yeah  The library  You know the one  It's quarter to nine right now  So it's probably  Beer time  Yeah  Crack another  Time for a shot  A holiday shot  A little drive around  The school zones  Give yourself a little treat  Because you almost made it  To 9 a.m.  Showing some willpower  Right  Yeah  I'm going to treat myself  Do you treat yourself dying?

Hey not too bad  Not too bad  Just had a question for you  Basically I'm an army veteran  Just got out of the service  Four months ago  Living in Omaha Nebraska  Coping with sobriety  What it comes down to it is  I'm not really happy here  I.e. like you know  When you quit drinking  And when you stop all this shit  You do a lot of soul searching  And basically what I wanted  To ask you folks is 
[03:17:30]  Like I'm looking for a town  Or a place that  You know there's good things  About Omaha  Hold on let me interrupt you real quick  I'm sorry to interrupt you  How long have you been sober?  Uh let's see  It's coming up 90 days  In a couple weeks  My suggestion would be this  And I can cut you off here  Here's why  Because you're brand new  In the program  They suggest no major changes  For a year  Yeah  And I think  And I've said this before  The old expression  Wherever I went  There I was  What you're looking to find  You may find somewhere else  But you should stay home 
[03:18:00]  Clean house a little first  Dude don't run to a new location  Because then you gotta  Get your apartment  Then you gotta pay rent  Then you gotta find a new job  It's all these distractions  You're trying to avoid  What you're gonna have to face  In early sobriety  Just deal with it  And it's not  Especially in early sobriety  It's always people  Places and things  Yeah  That's the one thing they say  It's you  It's you're dealing with you  So you wanna change  The place you live  Cause you think  That will make it better  Or change the people  You're around  Cause that will make it better  It's not that 
[03:18:30]  You're getting sober  You're 90 days  It sucks  Just go to meetings  Every day  And try to live  One day at a time  I mean that's what  You have to do  Moving is one of the  Most stressful things  I just did it  I just moved  I sold my place  I rented a place  And put an offer  On a place  All in one week  I almost  Murdered myself  My wife  And killed myself  It's crazy  And it sets off  All your addictions  And everything goes nuts  So don't  Jimmy's absolutely right  You just stay put 
[03:19:00]  And deal with your sobriety  You'll move eventually  Don't worry  Okay bro  Thanks for that Jimmy  Good luck buddy  Now Joe in New Jersey  My friend Jim  Had some success  Doing an advice show  And thinks he can  Give advice to everybody  Is this directed at me Joe  Hello  Yes Joe  Yes so  A friend of mine  He started out  As a comedy  Doing a comedy show  And he was funny  You know  He would take people's  Problems  And make you laugh  At them  And now  He's getting so full  Of himself  He's actually  Think he's giving advice 
[03:19:30]  And I want to tell him  To go back to comedy  But I don't know  How to do it  Is this Colin  I would suggest telling  No you know  You know how you tell him  You send the message silently  What you do is  You get in your car  And you aim for a wall  And you hit the gas  And go as fast as you can  And he'll understand  What you mean  As you go through  The windshield  I'm not dummy  Get funny again  You don't have  Well Joe  The advice I would give you  Is this  Stop smoking  Yeah first of all  Exactly no  Continue to smoke  Second of all 
[03:20:00]  Don't listen for this hour  It's one hour a week  I know  But I think  Jim is hysterical  Thank you  When he makes fun of people  I know  But I mean  You're in this moment  You're in the minority  Because this is  What I'm doing  So if people are calling up  With real  When a veteran calls up  And actually says  I'm suicidal  What am I going to do  Oh  Lucky you're not  One of two Jews  Walking into a bar  You're an idiot  And I don't think 
[03:20:30]  I'm qualified  To give advice  To everybody Joe  How many times  Do I say  Hey look  I'm not married  I don't have kids  All I'm giving  Is opinions  I'm the most honest  Advice guy  You're ever going to hear  Because I tell you  And I don't know shit  You see  You sounded  Too full of yourself  Now too  Not full of myself  At all Joe  The problem is  Your hearing  And your perception  You're a funny guy  Stay funny  Thank you  Hit a poll  That was fun  Alright 
[03:21:00]  Fucking  Joe's a cunt  Fucking  Goddy son  No  You're a funny guy  Stay funny  Jimmy  Just don't listen  I would never call  A radio show  And complain  Just fucking do  Something else  With your time  Go eat your wife's  Asshole for an hour  Let's see  For an hour  Jim in Pittsburgh  Yeah  Total fucking 11  Jim in Pittsburgh  Punished for being yourself  On a radio show  How do you remain funny  And keep your sponsors  Hi Jim  It's actually  Jay in Pittsburgh  My question is 
[03:21:30]  I've gotten advice  From you before  And I'm actually  The guy in your  Little commercial  The Jay from Pittsburgh  My question is  I had a show  A horrible show  Last week  And I had two guests  Bail on me  And one was  From a reality show  And I literally  Talked to her  Right before the show  And she skipped me  So I had two hours  Of time  I wasn't expecting  To sell  Without guests  Right  And I went off  On the air 
[03:22:00]  On my live podcast  Whatever internet show  And I didn't realize  A prospective sponsor  Was listening  And I lost that  Because of the rant  That I went on  Right  And I was just  Being me  And my friends  And my colleagues  Loved it  Just because  I was being myself  But I lost  The sponsor  From it  And starting off  That's like  Critical for me  And I also lost  The speaking engagement  Because I was going 
[03:22:30]  To speak for a group  In Michigan  And then  Well Jim let me ask you  If being honest  On the air  And addressing  A shitty situation  Lost you a sponsor  And a speaking commitment  How true to your own  Performing style  Do you think  That sponsor was  Or that  Speaking commitment was  You know I think  You have to be yourself  And Opie and Anthony's show  Has lost a tremendous  Amount of potential sponsors  Because of the content  I as a comedian  Have lost a lot of money  In my career  Because I work dirty  How much more money 
[03:23:00]  Can we make working clean  But you have to  You can make a lot of money  A lot more money clean  But it's a lot of  Horseshit  Too money  It's a lot of  Corporate things  That suck  You know  And the thing is  It's a veteran related show  I'm like the funny one  Out of the group  I guess the edgy one  Out of the group  So I want to be  Myself  But I also realize  I'm not just  Representing myself anymore  I'm representing  I guess  Some more serious people  Well you are  Representing yourself  Jim  I mean  You know what I mean  Like you're a veteran 
[03:23:30]  But you're Jim first  So you're a funny veteran  Or you're an interesting veteran  You're not a veteran  Whose name is Jim  The difference is  Be yourself  You are a veteran  Because you fought  Or you served  You know what I mean  You don't need to  Behave a certain veteran way  Just be you  Yeah  It's just  Like I said  I mean it was  I got done with the show  Last week  And I was on this high  I'm like  That was me  That was  That was completely honest  You know  I completely trashed this  Fucking reality show  Bitch  And then I get off 
[03:24:00]  And I just get a flood  Of phone calls  Like what the fuck  Did you do  You just cost money  For us  You cost money to yourself  And I explained it  And everyone's like  You know what  Cool  You know what  Fuck her  Be yourself  But at the same time  And like  I'm just like  I'm scratching by  Trying to get money  For this  Stupid show  And it's like  Here's my suggestion  James  Here's my suggestion  I can only suggest  Don't  You have to sometimes  Look at like  What you're doing  Like okay  Is this a smart thing 
[03:24:30]  To say  Or is it not  Like whenever I rant  Or I bash people  There's certain things  I don't say  You have to be able  To defend anything you say  So as long as you feel  Everything you said  Was justifiable  And defendable  Don't worry about it  Because you just  Happened to hear  About a sponsor  Who didn't show up  We never hear  About most of them  We just don't get them  So just be yourself  Buddy alright  Alright thanks man  Good luck my friend  Alright Bobby  What do you think  Which one  You're always good  With that too  Because you know  How to  You know  I'm a  I just go right  To anger and rage 
[03:25:00]  You fucking  Cock sucker  And say shit  You shouldn't say  But you know  How to pinpoint  Your anger  And not get yourself  In trouble  Sometimes  Probably being in trouble  Before  Yeah but I also  Yeah there's certain  Words you just don't say  It's really weird  Like if you're talking  About a product  You can say  I hate this product  This product sucks  But you can't come out  And go  This product doesn't work  Like if it's  You know what I mean  You can't say  Like you know  Whatever the fucking  You know  The cleaner is  That product  Doesn't get your  Products clean  Because then you're  Affecting their business  You can talk about  Your own experience  You know what I mean  I think there's  Really weird lines 
[03:25:30]  You have to avoid  Right  Which one do you think  Here  There's some good ones  The one about  His friend  Passed away  Okay let's talk to him  Rusty  Hi Rusty  What are you guys doing  My friend  She was  Drop dead gorgeous  Passed away  Six months ago  From pancreatic cancer  Pancreatic cancer  Yeah I know  She didn't tell me  For a long time  How old was she  She was 46  46  Okay  I could probably  Email you a picture  Of her  She was beautiful 
[03:26:00]  Okay  And her birthday is today  And I probably break down  Once a day  Crying or stuff like that  I'm an atheist  And the reason why  She did tell me  She would think  I would pray for her  Or stuff like that  I only became an atheist  A few years ago  So I get to bother her  But her boyfriend  Wanted me to go to  This friends in need  Meeting  And I went one time  And I can't listen  To everybody else's depression  About them losing love 
[03:26:30]  Because they're too depressing  They hear their stories  So I only went one time  And I felt out of place  So I'm an ambulance driver  I drive  You know  I take you to Dallas  And back in my van  And when I'm by myself  In my mind  I talk with her  And shit  Well you obviously  Do hear the thing  I mean you know  You're grieving  And it's  Six months  It's going to go away  It takes a while  It doesn't go right away  That's kind of healthy  It's not supposed to  I don't know how you  Deal with Patrice  I've never heard you guys  Really break down 
[03:27:00]  Because we've been sober  For a long time  We've had people  Commit suicide and die  And it never gets easier  But you understand  The process  Yeah but it's the  Buddy  I'm still not over  Patrice's death  Yeah me neither  I still talk to him  In my car  Because anytime I did  A road gig  And I drive home  I would always call him  And I'd talk to him  For a couple hours  On the phone  And sometimes I still do  I just saw his mother  Last week in Boston  To come home  And it's like  Seeing Patrice  So you're never really  Going to get over it bro  And you're always  Going to feel shitty 
[03:27:30]  And I have a lot of  Anger in me  Because of this  I just don't  I don't deal with  My friends much  I just don't  I'm not  I don't want to go  To take him  At dinner tomorrow  But I don't want to  Be angry in front of him  Well you don't have  To be angry  But you should live  Like the all  Encompassing obsession  With over a death  Does change  That's why I say  It never gets easier  But you learn the process  Like  Okay I'm going to  Grieve for a while  There's times  I still cry  Really late at night  And then my nose  Gets stuffy  I'm like  Why am I thinking  Of this motherfucker  And I can't breathe  I gotta fucking  Shoot afrin 
[03:28:00]  It's really bizarre  What's that  When my grandmother  Passed away  I didn't get this bad  My dad died  When I was 8  I wasn't as bad  I mean  I think friends  Are harder dude  Friends are harder  Because they're much  More a reflection  Of our own mortality  Than an older person  Who we expect  To die first  That's true  Right  This is really  Unexpected  It took forever  To find this  They couldn't ever find  She was always  At stomachache  They couldn't find  The pain  And when they finally  Found her  It was too late  I tried to get this  Even though she was  Sober for 10 years  I wanted to get  This medical marijuana  That you get 
[03:28:30]  It's THC  90% THC  You go to this  They run from the cure  On  There's a web  It doesn't even matter  I know what you're saying  You wanted to help her  Here's how you deal  But you were helpless  You were  And that's the  We are  When people are sick  And dying  But here's the fun part  Within 100 years  You  Me  And everyone else  Listening to this broadcast  Will be bye bye in the box  As my mother used to say  That's true  We are all 
[03:29:00]  A bunch of dead ducks  Look at a picture  Of Yankee Stadium  From 1920  That's 70,000  Dead cocksuckers  That's funny  So just enjoy  And I tell you this  Because I understand  The grief  Dude  You'll be there  Soon enough  Trust me  Don't rush the process  What are you  40?  I'm 50  I'm 50  You're halfway there  You're at least halfway there  And you should be happy  That you feel this strongly  About another human being  You have a friend  And you can feel the pain  Of loving and missing somebody 
[03:29:30]  Dude  You know  Hang out with people  That's the thing  I just can't  You'll get over it dude  It will get better  As time goes on  Six months  I know  It's just six months  It's been two years  And I still feel it  So  Yeah  Alright dude  Good luck my friend  You'll be okay  I met you to Sam Greenfield  A few years ago  Sam Greenfield  He went to the funeral  Okay  I like Sam  He's a good guy  Yeah  Alright  Take it easy  Be good my friend  Andrew New Jersey  How did you get back  A friend that cut you off 
[03:30:00]  Okay well Andrew  Why did this friend  Cut you off  Well basically  He  Got  Well he didn't get engaged  But he found a girl  About a year ago  And then all of a sudden  You know  He got engaged  And  Not only me  But  Our whole group of friends  Just disappeared  Off his radar one day  He like  Cut us all out of his life  Yeah it happens  But there was no warning  It was just  Gone  Everything gone  And what I guess  I'm  Wondering about is 
[03:30:30]  How do you  Go about  Trying to like  Rebuild a bridge  If you didn't even  See it coming  It just  Well he broke the bridge  Dude he broke it  Like the key is this  A lot of guys do that  In relationships  A lot of women do that  They get overwhelmed  In the new relationship  It becomes all consuming  And they fucking stay in it  And they lose their friends  For a while  So one of two things  You could text him  And go hey I miss you  And I miss hanging out  And see what happens  But you can't rebuild  The bridge  That he has taken down 
[03:31:00]  And he may be happy  On the little island  That he's on now  That's true  But  I don't know  It just seems so strange  I really want to  I look back on it now  And you know  This is like a guy  You know  We know  We were kids  And all of a sudden  It's just like  Over  It's almost like  She brainwashed him  Well  There's no victims  Only volunteers  He's an adult  He didn't have to do that  He chose to do it  So again  You can be honest  You can say  I miss you  Hey where you been  Let's hang out 
[03:31:30]  Maybe he'll be happy  To hear from you  And go for dinner  Maybe not  Alright well thank you  Bobby you're married  I mean how do you  Bounce that shit  Well I mean look  The wife's cool  It's a little different  But  She's cool  She gets all my friends  But I mean  When I had the kid  When I had the kid  And I moved  And all this crazy shit  I did  Look I've lost friends  Dude  I stopped talking to people  Over the last  You know  Couple years  And even the last  Couple months  I mean  You get busy  Well things happen  You get stressed  You say shit  You get in a fight  So you get busy  You can only deal 
[03:32:00]  With so much  Right  When you're adding new  My whole life  Has changed in the last  Six months  I mean  Crazy  I don't  I don't  I don't take naps  I don't sleep  I don't  I wake up at seven  And I'm up for the day  And I live in the suburbs  It's  That's overwhelming  Stressful shit  And until you  Plane off again  Until you  Real  This is your life  There's certain  Things that happen  Where you're like  I can't deal with that  I can't  I just gotta cut it off  Cause if I try to do too much  I'm gonna fucking  Shoot myself  Right  So you just 
[03:32:30]  Kinda  Deal with what you got  And some  Sometimes there's cash  Casualties  You know  Sometimes you don't  Talk to people  For six months  A year  Maybe two  And then  That phone call  Like you said  Maybe a text message  Hey man what's up  And you apologize  Everybody fucks up  Everybody does stupid shit  And you get over it  It's not as bad  You know  Like you said  We're all gonna fucking die  So you kinda do  What you do for a while  And then hopefully  Later on you  Can patch shit up  And go for lunch 
[03:33:00]  Or be friends again  It's not gonna be the same  Sure  But it'll be what it is  Now  You know  Alright  Let's see  Bob wants to talk to  Girl I got pregnant  A number of years ago  And I'm wondering  If I should tell my wife  Or not  Ooh  Bob in studio  No I'm kidding  Hi Kevin  Kevin in Atlanta  Jesus Christ  How's it going  I'm 47  I've been married  17 years  And I got a 7 year old kid  But back when I was  18 or 19 years old  There was a regional  Touring band  In the city  I lived in  That had this hot  Female keyboard player 
[03:33:30]  And I banged her  A couple times  Partridge family  No  Okay  But I banged her  And moved out of that city  And moved down to Atlanta  And back in February  I noticed that this band  Was having a reunion  So I found this chick  On Facebook  And I tried to friend her  And so she  Direct messaged me back  She said  Is this a Kevin  From Cincinnati  I'm like yeah  And she goes  Well I don't know  How to tell you this  But that night  We were together  I got pregnant 
[03:34:00]  And his name is Dublin  And that kid would probably  Be late 20s now  Wow  So I was in shock  What did you say  That's a dumb name  Yeah  No  So I text  I direct messaged her back  And I said  I don't really know  What to do  If you guys want to  Talk to me  You can  Or if you want me  To disappear  I can do that too  And she texted back  And said  Yeah it probably  Would be good  If you just disappeared  And I haven't heard  From her since February  One of two things  The question is  Do I tell my wife  Do I tell my wife  About this 
[03:34:30]  Or just keep my mouth shut  Why not  You didn't do anything wrong  I'll tell you  Yes you do  You tell your wife  I tell my wife  You tell  You tell your wife  Because  Wait were you married  When it happened  No  No this was like  I was 18  I was still in high school  I hadn't met my wife  For 10 years  So no  Because you don't want to be  You don't want to be  At a fucking Red Robin  And have this broad  And your kid come up  Exactly  Right before Vlasko's on stage  Okay 
[03:35:00]  The hamburgers are good  Okay  But you don't want to be  Somewhere in public  At a mall  Or anywhere  And have this girl  Come up and go  Hey  And then this is your  And you don't know  Where her frame of mind  Is going to be  When she sees you  With the kids  She might go  This is your son  And then your wife  What the fuck  What's going on  And it's not  You did what you did  She made her decision  You gave her the option  You said  I will be there  I won't  It's up to you  She said no  Disappear 
[03:35:30]  And you're respecting  Her wishes  You know  And she might be lying  Dude  She might be lying  She may have a son  Because A  You've had no DNA test  So  She may have a son  And not sure  Whose it is  Or she may be mad  That you just  Fucked her  And took off  That may be like  A little  A little  Fuck you  Get away from me  One night stand  Payback  That's it  Yeah  And she  Yeah exactly  And who wants to  Fucking hang out  With a kid named  Dublin  Yeah he's 22  Got his own  Dumb identity  You're going to have to go  This is my son Dublin 
[03:36:00]  They're going to go  Who  Dublin  Like  Oh fuck  Just call him D  Yeah  Well I appreciate the advice  I will take it  And just kind of  Figure out a way  To drop this one  All right  Without her freaking out  She's not going to freak out  She's going to be cool  It's not  You just tell her  It was before you  I found out I had a kid  I didn't know  She doesn't want me  And here you go  That's what it is  If she can't deal  With the reality  She's going to be like  Now our kid  Has a half brother  Out there somewhere  And I know her  That's going to bother her  A little bit  Even though I'm not at fault  Oh 
[03:36:30]  So  Well still  I'll take your advice  I think you're probably right  What's your kid's name  Paul  Good  Yay  Oh Jesus  It's a wonderful name  See ya  All right  Let's see  How about  Shannon Portland  How do I get over someone  In parentheses  Romantically  Hi  How are you  I'm okay  I've been talking to this guy  For like a year now  And we've met up a few times  And we've even had sex 
[03:37:00]  And he pretty much  Just wants to be friends  Okay  I think  But he doesn't really like  Tell me that  He kind of implies  That he wants to be  Fuck buddies too  But we live really far away  From each other  So it's kind of hard to do that  Right  And I'm like  I'm really into him actually  And he's  I don't think he's  That into me  How often do you talk to him  A lot actually  Like  Almost every day  Okay  And where does he live 
[03:37:30]  He lives  In this other place  In Oregon  That I'm not gonna say  Oh okay fair  Well if he's only  Fucked you a while ago  And what's the use  Of you staying in touch  With him  If you know  That's all it is  Like that nothing else  Is gonna come of this  Cause we hang out  And sometimes we  Hang out  And we just talk  And like  In person I mean  What do you want from him  I just want like  A casual relationship  And he pretty much  Fly out told me  That he doesn't ever  Want to date me long term  Well that's kind of  Insulting right 
[03:38:00]  Yeah  So you're hurt  You're hurt by it  So why don't you move on  Not fuck him  But you want more  You don't want to  Just be a fuck buddy  Or a low dump  You like this guy  A little bit  And you're kind of sad  That it won't develop  Into something else  Yeah  And it's probably  I don't know how to move on though  Cause I tried  I tried dating other people  Fuck a comedian in New York  I'm telling you  Fuck a comedian in New York  I'll make you so  I know I'll make you  Want to run back to him  I'll give you such an awful bang  You'll be right back with him  Yeah 
[03:38:30]  You might have  And I'm not saying that you are  But you might have  Fat girl syndrome  You know  And guys can get that too  Sure  It's when  You know  Somebody fucks with your self esteem  In their relationship  And he said that to you  You just kind of want to get back  On an even playing field with him  You're trying to get to where  You know what  Your ego  Or your self esteem  Is better again  And then you'll say  Go fuck yourself  So you might  It's better to take the hit  Walk away  Delete his number from your phone 
[03:39:00]  And then all of a sudden  Watch what happens  He'll start missing you  And you'll have the upper hand  And you'll be able to make  A better  Clearer decision psychologically  On if you really do want to be  With this fucking jackass  Because who doesn't want  A chick  I don't care how heavy you are  Just that wants to  Fuck around casually  Are you a big girl?  Not really  Okay  Well it's  Boss has been insulting you  No I mean  I don't mean you're a fat girl  I said that  You're not fat  Yeah we picked up  Bob Porth 
[03:39:30]  I did stop talking to him  For a while  Like there was a time  Where we didn't talk to each other  For a while  And I dated other people  But I still liked him  Yeah  That's hard  I mean I'm sorry  Shan right  It's hard  Yeah  I would suggest  If it's hurting you  Then for a while  Take a break on seeing  And contacting him  Because it's just going  To remain painful  Sometimes you just got to  Detox off somebody  And find somebody else  And then maybe you'll be  In a better place to be friends  And come to New York  And fuck a comedian  Yeah exactly  Alright I'll try  Here's what I do  I fuck doggy style 
[03:40:00]  And then I put my hands up  In the air  Like I'm on a roller coaster  It's a lot of fun  And I yell yay  Good luck sweetheart  Alright bye bye  You have a nice laugh  Let's see here  Dave in Missouri  Hold on  Horrible fucking Missouri  My relationship is falling apart  And I'm not sure why  I think I answered your question  Hi Dave  Hi Jim  What's up buddy  I've been married now  For a year  Okay  The last six months  I've been on the road  Off and on  I come home on the weekends 
[03:40:30]  Your trucker  Yes I'm a trucker  She's turned  Very cold  Here of late  About the last  Five months  I come home  We try to have date nights  To make up  For the lost time  But she's not really  Into that  She makes up excuses  Not to go  Do you guys have a kid?  No we do not have a kid  Did you do this job  When you met her?  Yes I had the job  For 14 years  Before I met her  I wonder  Either A  She resents  The fact that you're away 
[03:41:00]  And she's angry  And you can feel that  Do you think she's having an affair?  I really think that  She just started a new job  And ever since she started a new job  She's been kind of cold  Because I'm wondering  Sometimes if someone's having an affair  And I'm not saying she is  Sometimes they feel guilty  And they pull back  Because the guilt is bothering them  Or they lose interest in the relationship  And also  When somebody starts a new job  That's a whole new world  New people  New self-esteem  And they  You know  Some guy at work  Who's brand new 
[03:41:30]  And gives her the attention  That you used to give her  And all that shit  That could be fucking up your  Behind your back  Like that  Could be fucking up your relationship  I always try to keep it  You know  I always make baths for her  Cook dinners  While I'm home  I try to keep it  Lighthearted  And I try not to bring up my feelings  Because anytime I do  She'll shut me down  And say  I don't want to talk about that  Well she sounds awful  Like why did you marry this  This lovely lady  She's  You're hurting about something 
[03:42:00]  And she doesn't give a fuck  About your feelings  She doesn't want to fuck you  She's distant  What are you doing with her?  I don't know  I mean  She wasn't like that  In the beginning at all  And as soon as we got married  It changed everything  Yeah  A lot of guys say that man  Maybe she's  Maybe she's feeling  Buyer's regret  As they say  And maybe she's wishing  That you guys weren't married yet  Maybe she like  Maybe she feels trapped  Women can feel trapped too  Yeah I understand that  She's home playing  With her pussy every night  While you're out fucking  On the road in a truck  And she's like  I want to get fucked  And I can't 
[03:42:30]  So maybe she's not happy with that  That's funny  Because every time I come home  I try to be with her  And she's got a headache  Or I don't feel good  That's not  Dude that doesn't sound right  It doesn't sound right  There's something going on  That's not the way  Even in a relationship  Where things are bad  Or things are a little fucked up  It's not that  There's something going on  You don't know about  And you need to  You need to find out  You need to sit down with her  And say look  Go fuck yourself  I don't care  We're talking  We're not forgetting about it 
[03:43:00]  We're either going to talk  Or this shit's going to go to crap  So you need to sit down  And put your foot down with her  And make this shit happen  Because there's something wrong  Something's going on  I think so too  Alright  I think so too  Can you toot  Can you toot your horn for us?  Yeah  Thank you  A little Honda  Just fucking  Got scared  Yeah  Ran off the road  Yeah  Someone's in a lake right now  Because of you  Thanks a lot man  Take care  Good luck buddy  Thanks Jimmy  Justin New Hampshire 
[03:43:30]  Where are you now then?  What are you in fucking Maine  Or something?  Vermont?  Give a fuck  How are we doing today?  Named states  What's up Justin?  Well  So I don't have too many  I work a lot  And I don't have a lot of opportunities  To ask girls out  And this girl  Why?  What do you do for work?  Do you work a lot?  You don't have an opportunity  To ask them out  What do you do?  What are you a rapist?  Pretty close  I'm a car salesman  That's funny  It's worse 
[03:44:00]  So what's  Why don't you have opportunities  To ask them out?  Well  I only know her  When I go through her line  When she's a cashier  At the store across the street  Oh okay  So whenever I'm there  There's usually five or six people behind  I don't really know her  And I don't know if I should  Give her my number  Ask her how  What to do  It's hard  Do you know her name  Or any of that stuff?  I know her name  Yeah  Okay  That's kind of awkward  Did you ever ask her to  Come by and see at the lot?  That's kind of awkward I guess 
[03:44:30]  No  You have to get her  You don't want to do it  In front of people  You got to get her alone  Like you know  I kind of disagree  Okay  I think that you  Look you go there all the time  She knows who you are  You know she is  You just man up  Walk in there one day  And you go  What's  How you doing?  She's going to go  Hi  When are we going out?  And she's going to go  What?  I go  When are we going out?  I want to take you out  When are we doing that?  And she's going to go  I don't know 
[03:45:00]  And you go  Alright well listen  Here's my number  Call me  I want to take you out  And then you walk out  Who gives a shit  If some old bag  Sees you do it?  Who cares?  And then you know  You're done  You made your move  The ball's in her court  She calls you  Great  If she doesn't  That's it  And then you can go back in  And go  I guess we're not going out  And blow it off  Yeah  Get it over with  And then just stare at her  Angrily through the window  While she tries to work  With change in your pocket  And just fiddle with the change  Fiddle with the change  Or walk in with 
[03:45:30]  Walk in with fucking flowers  And thrust them out  And assure her  That either a yes  Or her brains  Are going to be on the flowers  Pull the old Luca Brasi  Danny  So don't find out  What kind of car she drives  And then stand out  Waiting for her at night  Take a shit on the hood  In your name  Like form your name  At a log  Or um  Yeah you don't want  To leave a note  But I would say  It's really awkward  But I would try to get there  When there's nobody online  Or even when there's people online 
[03:46:00]  Go in there regularly  And talk to her  And be friendly  Stand out  Hey how's working  You know whatever  Does she show you any interest  When you talk to her?  Yeah she does  I uh  You know I try and  You know get her temperature  Try and small talk  I know she's got two kids  I haven't seen a ring on her finger  Okay  Um  That's  That's all I know  I don't even know  She might not  She might not even be available  I don't  I don't even know  That's true  Do you have kids?  I have one  Yeah I'm divorced  Okay  Yeah  Just man up and do it 
[03:46:30]  Or hand her a note  Yeah hand her a note  You know just get it over with  Cause you can't live with this  You can't just keep going  Oh I want to do it  I want to do it  Cause the more you do that  The harder it's gonna be  It's like when you get  Uh when you're in a fight  With somebody  And you should call them  But you keep putting it off  Putting it off  The longer you wait  The harder it is to call them  Then you wind up  Just never fucking doing it  Just get it over with  Man up  Be a man  And then go get some pussy  That big wide  Two kid pussy  That you want  Yeah exactly  Alright guys  Thanks a lot  I really appreciate it  What's your next call gonna be 
[03:47:00]  How do I get a babysitter?  Yeah  What do I do?  How do I purchase a product  It's on the shelf  And I want to bring it home with me  Yet the alarm goes off  Stealing it  Yeah just walk in there and talk  Let's see  Uh  Brandon in California  Is living a lot of people's dream  His wife leaves him  Very frequently  To go visit family  For the entire weekend  What's up Brandon?  Hey Jimmy  Actually it's a girlfriend  And like the last year 
[03:47:30]  She's spent about the last  About 20 weekends  Of the last year  Visiting her parents  Okay  It bothers me  But I've never complained to her about it  I don't know if I should talk to her about it  I don't know if that's  You know crossing the line  You know  Of course you should talk to her about it  She's your chick  Oh she's your chick  She's not your wife  Um  Does she ever invite you to go?  I went with her once  How was it?  It was nerve wracking  I mean  Met her parents for the first time  Uh  They were kind of judgmental  I'm white  She's Asian 
[03:48:00]  And that really didn't go over very well  Oh okay  So she's probably was raised  To be studious and obedient  And the good daughter  And now here you are  She's fucking banging this round iron  Maybe she's just trying to keep  The relationship with her parents good  Yeah well she's  She's 27  It just seems a little odd  That she visits so much  That might be just a  Cultural  That is a cultural thing  Very cultural  Asian girls  Very close with their family  Very close with their fathers  Yes  Respect is a huge thing with them  Unless they're sold off for a mule  Or other 
[03:48:30]  Trinkets  Yeah  Or killed because it's the third girl baby  Yeah  Yeah they're very close to their families  Other than that  When they're married off  For a fucking bushel of wheat  And some rice  We're kidding with you of course  Listen I would just suggest  Talking to her about it  If it's bugging you  Tell her she shut up in a container  Exactly  What happened  Well my girlfriend goes back  And I want my  They want their horse back  Alright  She's going to trade it for a horse  Alright  Sorry  I would say just talk to her about it 
[03:49:00]  That's all you can do  Okay thank you  Alright buddy  Good luck  Sometimes just talking to somebody  All you can do is tell her how you feel  You know it's not like it's your wife  That's a big difference  Yeah but as a white guy  When you're going to date  Somebody who has cultural differences  You have to accept their culture  She's you know  She's going to go and see your family every weekend  And eat a lot of rice  Yeah  So you're going to  You're going to have to accept that stuff  There's certain things that they do differently  That you're going to  If you're going to date out of your  You know somebody who's not from this country  Yes you're going to 
[03:49:30]  Let's be honest  Disobeys God's laws  Yes  I said that really  I'm tired  I said disobey God's laws  Let's see  Having a problem  Delayed ejaculation  Eric in Indiana  Eric in Diana  What is Diana doing right now?  Hey man Bob  What's up buddy  I hate Chip  I thought man  Yeah so  I have a weird problem  Which you probably  Won't have much sympathy for me  But  Yeah so I was in a  I was in a marriage for 10 years  Recently out  Got a beautiful girlfriend 
[03:50:00]  And she's fucking hot  And knows how to fuck  And  Initially it was  It was exciting  Because  I couldn't get off  And so we were just fucking  For 3 or 4 hours  Fuck 4 or 5 times a night  Wow  It was great  It's one of those relationships  Well the problem is  Is  I wouldn't say it's an issue  And we've kind of talked about it  But  She has this sort of complex  I mean  My ex-wife is beautiful  And so  Is it me?  Am I the reason you're not able to come? 
[03:50:30]  There's times  That I want to come  Completely  I mean the sex is great  And I just  You know  I have to bear down  And really fucking hammer it  To get it going  I don't know  It's  And then the more I think about it  The harder it becomes  Do you jerk off?  Yeah  I mean  Not as often as  Not as often as I should  No but  Recently I've tried to  Even do that  I mean I've been researching it  And so I've been trying to jerk off  Not  I wouldn't say more  But just to  Control my orgasm 
[03:51:00]  I guess  Or  I don't think jerking off  Is going to help you hold off  It's hard for me to come sometimes too  And then I get afraid  If I don't come fast  I'm going to lose my rod  It's this whole mental thing  You get into  It's probably mostly mental  Yeah  When you're fucking  Just open your mouth  Like a cock's going to come in it  And you should come right away  Yeah  Fair enough  Maybe that's what I'm missing  I mean  She's completely sexually open  She's  I mean  We're doing all kinds of shit  That neither of us have really done before  Cool  But 
[03:51:30]  But yeah  It's just  You know  How much  Damage can I deliver to her  Before I fucking come  Is the problem  You know what I mean  It's just  I mean after  Two or three times  It's like  Well are you going to get yours  And I'm like  I don't know  Jim  Have you ever gone to a tantric massage  Yes of course  I mean I've never been  But I mean that's their whole thing  Is they'll teach you how to  Come  Control your orgasms  Yeah  Is it  Is it bullshit  Well I mean  Like they told me  Like I didn't realize  What I was doing  But they said  That I have to stop humming  Push push  In the bush 
[03:52:00]  While I fucking  I think you should stop  Are you taking any dick pills  Like a Viagra or Cialis  No not at all  Because they make it hard to come  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  What's that  Dude your phone is  Your phone is breaking up  We're not hanging up on you 
[03:52:30]  Sorry about that  Take care  Sorry buddy  Your phone was shit in the bed  You know  I would say stop jerking off  But I have a problem coming too  It's usually in your head  I find that  A lot of times  I've held back so many times  Jerking off  That it's really hard for me  Just to go over the edge  The first time  Anthony is having a problem  With alcoholism  That's not a call  That's just a statement  Yeah  Okay  I was going to say yes  Anthony from his rented truck  Let's see  Art in Wisconsin  Having a problem with alcoholism 
[03:53:00]  Hi Art  Jimmy  Welcome  Hey  I went through a lot of stuff  The last couple years  And drank  Heavy heavy heavy  I finally woke up  To my  Realization  After a girlfriend left  That  I just stopped  Cold turkey  I know I need to go  To a 12 step  Or something  But how do you do that  When you're in a small  Small town  And  Doesn't matter  You're in a small town  It's  You know 
[03:53:30]  Who cares if they see you there  Think about it this way  Through your drunken escapades  They see you drinking  And moseying around town  Drunk  Banging in the mailboxes  And you're worried  They're going to see you  In a place getting sober  Having coffee  That's just an excuse  I would suggest  Going to a 12 step meeting  And don't worry about them  Seeing you  Because your liver health  And you living a long life  And being productive  Is a lot more important  Than one nosy  Fucking cunt neighbor  Don't worry about  Who's going to see you  Fuck them  Okay  So go to the meeting 
[03:54:00]  Seeing a therapist also  I mean  That  Seems to help  Yeah it's a nice help  But it's not enough  Yeah you gotta go to meetings  But a therapist is good  Because it's a neutral place  Where you can be  100% honest  And it's not going to  Affect your life  Okay  You know you can  You can say  Whatever the fuck you want  And get it all out  And you're not going to  Ruin a friendship  Or marriage  Or relationship  Because you know  You just fucking  Won't shut the fuck up  You know what I mean  You know  You can tell them anything 
[03:54:30]  So that's good  But you gotta go to meetings  I'm blue with those  Relationships already  So  Alright well  You know what you gotta do brother  Good luck okay  Have a nice Thanksgiving  Thanks Jimmy  Be safe  Let's go to this one  Dave in Ohio  Stealing Vicodin  Whoever spelled Vicodin in there  You're a clod  Vicodin  Vicodin  What the fuck is that  Is that one fucking  It was almost improv horribly  From my mother-in-law's cabinet  Should I be concerned  Yes if you're stealing Vicodin  From your mother-in-law's cabinet 
[03:55:00]  You should be concerned  Dave in Ohio  Yeah I've been telling it  Over the course of my life  Where I've never been an addict  Before  I don't have that type of personality  But I know it makes me feel good  And if I'm at like a friend's house  Or a family member's house  I'll actually go through  Their medicine cap  To see if they have any  And I kind of justify it to myself  By saying  Well they're not using it  I look at the data on the bottle  It's three years ago  I'm like  They never get used it  I'll take a couple  Did you do the same thing  With aspirin? 
[03:55:30]  No  Did you do the same thing  With cough medicine  And cough drops?  No  No it's a drug thing  You were looking for drugs  Obviously  So you know what you gotta do  You know you should be concerned  That's why you're calling  Yeah  And I'm not being a dick to you  I'm saying like  Sometimes we already know the answer  And we just need to hear it  You're concerned  You should be concerned  Normal people  Do not steal pills  Out of medicine cabinets  Normal people don't look  At other people's  You go in  You take a piss  And you get out  I've never looked  At Bob Kelly's medicine cabinet  Because I'm not using drugs  I've never looked at E-Rock's 
[03:56:00]  Expiration dates  On his fucking medicine  You know Kurt Metzger  Like he was at my house  Like a year ago  And around four months ago  He called me up  He goes  Hey are you using those  Vicodin that are in  Your medicine cabinet?  Like he looked  Yeah  In my medicine cabinet  And saw a Vicodin  Yeah  That Don had  For something  That we never use  And I wouldn't have  Thrown it out  I'm like  That's just sitting there  Dump in the toilet  Yeah  So yes  You should be concerned  My friend  I think that's a very bad sign  What if it was aspirin 
[03:56:30]  Hypothetically  I mean  What is the big difference  If I'm not addicted  To just substance  Isn't it kind of the same thing?  Well I think you know  The difference  In that this  We don't tend to  Steal things  That aren't addictive  Like  Most people  Don't break into houses  Because they want to buy waffles  They break into houses  Because they want to buy drugs  Most people don't steal  To buy fucking  You know  Diet Coke  They steal to buy drugs 
[03:57:00]  Or beer  You know  You're stealing pills  If it's not a big deal  Ask her for one  Yeah  Or don't take them  First of all  You're stealing  Which is shitty enough  Like  Here's why it's bad  Because it's convinced you  That the real issue  Is how dangerous is this  Instead of  Hey  I'm fucking stealing  You should be alarmed  That you're stealing from people  Yeah  And I'm not  I'm not scolding you bro  I'm simply saying  These things that we allow ourselves  To do in addiction  These things that we become  Comfort  Like when I cheat  I've cheated on a lot of women 
[03:57:30]  There's a couple I haven't  But there's a lot that I have  I convinced myself  It was okay to lie to their fucking faces  And it's not  So you're stealing and lying  From people who expect honesty from you  So that's why you should be concerned  Because you only do that  To cover up an addiction  Yeah  Yep  Alright  Alright man  Appreciate it  Good luck man  Hit a meeting or something  There's no reason you have to go through  The holidays like that  It's fucking sickening  Okay  Good luck my friend  You know
