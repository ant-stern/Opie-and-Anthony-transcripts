<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of Mike Birbiglia and Rich Voss's mutual masturbation, leading to graphic descriptions and a debate on the definition of homosexuality.  The conversation then abruptly shifted to a 7.2 earthquake in Baja California, followed by absurd speculation about the ocean's post-quake contents.  The hosts then launched into a tirade about their inadequate SiriusXM studio setup, complaining about technical issues and comparing it unfavorably to smaller stations.

The show's main segment focused on violent incidents involving young black people in Times Square on Easter Sunday.  Opie and Anthony engaged in a heated, racially charged discussion, using numerous racial slurs and criticizing the media and prominent African-American figures for avoiding direct mention of race.  They debated racial profiling with callers, creating a contentious and offensive atmosphere.

The Tiger Woods infidelity scandal dominated a significant portion of the show.  The hosts and callers dissected the scandal, focusing on Jocelyn James, repeatedly calling her an "attention whore," and criticizing her lawyer, Gloria Allred.  They discussed Woods's drug use, potential sponsorship deals, and the media's coverage, frequently resorting to crude and sexually explicit language.  A caller, Burt from Augusta, corrected the media's portrayal of James's proximity to the Masters tournament. Another caller offered a Seinfeld reference.  The segment also included discussion of Obama's athletic abilities,  a lengthy analysis of an Apache helicopter attack that killed two Reuters reporters, and an interview with Joanna Molloy, a Daily News writer covering the Woods scandal.  Molloy discussed the media's coverage, the public's fascination with Woods' downfall, and the concept of *schadenfreude*.  She also hinted at further gossip about Woods. The hosts concluded this section with jokes about Anthony's past scandals.

The show continued with a discussion of a man who fathered two children without using condoms, followed by a conversation with Joanna (who left the studio).  Richard Huff from the Daily News was mentioned as a previous guest.  A "Vaginal Self-Esteem by Jim Norton" segment followed, featuring vulgar commentary.  Bob Kelly then joined the show, and the conversation quickly turned to a foul-smelling substance in New York City that Kelly described as smelling like semen, ultimately speculated to be from Bradford pear trees.  The discussion segued into graphic descriptions of Bob Kelly's experiences in peep shows and further conversations about bodily odors.  A caller shared a story about a disturbing individual at a comedy show, resulting in an audio clip.

A later segment began with a discussion of the hosts' childhood experiences and then moved to Adam Carolla's controversial comments about Manny Pacquiao and the Philippines.  The hosts debated Carolla's remarks and the ensuing backlash, touching upon potential accusations of racism.  The discussion devolved into a vulgar comparison of the attractiveness of women from different Asian countries, fueled by Google Image Search.  A news story about a monkey attacking its owner led to discussions of exotic pets, a caller's anecdote about his brother's relationship with a Filipino woman, and various cryptids.  Bob Kelly returned as a guest, expressing his intense dislike for the Beatles with offensive language.  This prompted a lengthy discussion about music, with the hosts playing various songs and making crude jokes.  The segment concluded with a discussion of the Time Magazine 100 most influential people poll and their support for Dana White.

A final segment focused primarily on music, beginning with a discussion of a John Mayer song and subsequently covering various artists including Hedwig and the Angry Inch, Motorhead, and Wolfmother.  The conversation shifted to a comedic analysis of a "We're Back" style song, leading to a discussion of Brad Delp's suicide.  The hosts discussed Keith Robinson and Opie being bumped from performances, then transitioned to hunting shows, describing graphic details of hunting deer and turkeys.  Finally, the show discussed David Shuster's suspension from MSNBC, speculated to be due to disloyalty. The show ended with a rambling discussion about Robert Kelly's low Twitter following and a series of nonsensical phrases.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  77.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, it's E-Rock.  And Sam from the Opie and Anthony Show.  More O&A in a minute.  But first, you know one of Sam's favorite activities, jerking off in front of people?  This involved Mike Birbiglia and Voss talking about that same exact subject.  I'm an exhibitionist.  So is Birbiglia.  So is Voss.  O&A are disgusted.  They think it's gay.  But see what you think.  Check it out.  They're nuts.  Yeah, but I told that story on the radio that me and my friends used to jerk off.  We used to hang you.  We'd come home at night.  That's not gay when two guys jerk off.  It kind of is, Rich.  If you touch the other guy's dick, then it's a little gay. 
[00:00:30]  I agree with you.  He said it's a little gay.  But it's not gay.  Rich, I never had the desire to jerk off in front of another guy, though.  You know why?  It's not an in front of thing.  No, you're doing it together.  Wait, you did too, Mike?  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Well, I was distracted because another employee just got their wings, as someone is saying.  Got their wings.  They're getting their wings.  Mike, that's not gay.  I got distracted.  I got taken out of this conversation.  So you jerked off in front of a guy, and Rich Voss has.  Yeah, but it wasn't like we were low.  No, we were looking at each other. 
[00:01:00]  We were watching porn jerking off.  You have something called peripheral vision.  Looking at each other.  Peripheral vision.  You're seeing some type of movement here.  Well, we did it.  See?  I can look over here, but if I make a movement next day, I can see my hands.  I didn't look at him, but I sat on his lap as we did it.  No, we did it.  Me and a couple friends.  I played basketball growing up, and it was all about peripheral vision, so there's no fucking  way I could get in that situation.  First of all, there's something about it.  Even though you're not touching each other or anything, there's a moment when you're fucking 
[00:01:30]  cumming that is this passionate moment.  Regardless if you're with yourself, it's still a passionate moment of sexual release, and  it's with another guy.  You're sharing a moment.  Regardless if you're looking at each other, you're sharing a moment.  I don't do it now.  I'm talking about when you're like 12, and you're discovering...  Fucking pot tease.  But let's get into this for a second.  It's so easy to just say it's gay, okay? 
[00:02:00]  But what are you bonding over?  That's true.  Like when you have friends as a kid, you're bonding over the porn, I suppose.  You bond over maybe the latest Black Sabbath or Zeppelin or a cool album that comes out  or a movie or maybe wrestling or something, whatever.  But how are you bonding with your friend over porn?  I remember when we jerked off together, I only had like two hairs, and he had like  a lot of hair, and I was jealous that he had...  A little hairless rich boss.  I had a little like two little hairs.  It was like a little turkey.  You saw each other.  It was like a plucked chicken. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, it was like a little plucked chicken.  Did your ball bag look like a tight little clam shell?  It was just like it was a Jew holding money.  That's how tight it was.  I don't think there was a visibility thing, though.  I think there were socks involved.  Yeah, but it's just like, why wouldn't you do it separately?  Maybe watch the porn together.  Remember when you saw...  There was so much porn, we just jerked off.  Oh, my God.  Wow, you didn't have to worry about it.  You were at his mother.  I was sleeping over at his house, and his mother was in the next room.  I don't know about for you, but for me, it was more exciting at times to jerk off in  front of a girl than fuck her. 
[00:03:00]  Like, one time, this is true, I was jerking off in front of a girl, and I shot a load through  two Dunkin' Donut napkins, through two of them.  No way.  I'm not fucking lying.  That's impossible.  No, it's not possible.  I swear to God.  But he couldn't through this bounty paper towel.  The O.B.  Anthony Show starts now.  Previously on O&A.  7.2 earthquake?  If it hits anywhere else...  7.2 in Baja, California, yeah.  If that thing hits anywhere else, it destroys cities, but... 
[00:03:30]  You know...  Nothing there.  Oh, Baja's kind of in the middle of nowhere, right?  It was the California-Mexico border, and, uh...  They picked a good area to hit.  Yeah, two people died.  One guy on the Mexican side, his house caved in on him.  Yeah.  And another guy, um, was so scared, he ran out of his house and was hit by a car and killed.  You think they're synced up with their fucking rags?  Used tampons, just floating?  Oh, big, big weightless bubbles of clotted blood, just... 
[00:04:00]  Like, like, like it's some deep sea fucking organism.  Looks like somebody fucking let loose the cherry jubilee.  Just floating around.  I didn't know there were jellyfish up in space.  The guy's going around...  Plucking them out of thin air.  Like jelly beans.  Welcome to the people hearing us for the first time on Sirius, the free preview.  Oh, hi, how are you?  If you're going to show RoboCop on your HD network, can you try making it look a little better? 
[00:04:30]  I mean, seriously, who...  Who doesn't have an HD television right now?  Seriously.  Who doesn't?  Why wouldn't you show...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, poor Sam.  But when they're catering to people that have regular fucking CRT TVs...  I don't need black bars on the left and right side of my screen.  I don't.  There should not be...  I don't like black bars anywhere near me or my neighborhood.  Jesus.  I think I have a few. 
[00:05:00]  Just around your windows.  And the whole family has to eat Sam's favorite meal.  Was it like the Twilight Zone where Anthony wanted hamburgers with peanut butter on them?  So everyone has to eat hamburgers.  That's exactly right.  That's very good, Anthony.  So there's Sam's distinguished father with his handlebar mustache eating fucking chicken fingers.  That's your favorite meal?  Instead of having a nice, like, I don't know, steak dinner or something for his birthday. 
[00:05:30]  I would have guessed it was a Vince McMahon shit in a fucking taco shop.  Copian Anthony, live next.  I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I 
[00:06:00]  Thank you. 
[00:06:30]  Thank you. 
[00:07:00]  Thank you. 
[00:07:30]  Thank you. 
[00:08:00]  Thank you. 
[00:08:30]  Thank you. 
[00:09:00]  Thank you. 
[00:09:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Hey, good morning, everyone.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show for this Tuesday.  Is that what it is?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:10:00]  Cheese thigh.  We're still trying to set up the studio.  Yeah, we came into a slight clusterfuck.  We had to listen to the news.  We had to listen to the news in the morning because, you know, when you do a morning show, it's kind of smart to be up on things.  So, you know, I get in the night and I get in the night and I get in here late breaking news, things like that.  We were the only ones around in the studio today, and we're sitting here awkwardly listening to some call-in religious program, and we can't even find it on any of our TVs. 
[00:10:30]  No, some Rasta guy.  And they finally got the TVs to work, I don't know, five minutes ago.  Yeah.  And then my laptop shits the bed just before we go on the air.  I mean, this is like, this is like, this is not a professional organization.  That's a crapshoot, whether everything all, you know.  I got to tell you, man, and then we'll move on.  Jimmy and I were in Rochester.  What is this? 
[00:11:00]  Oh, God.  Jimmy and I were in Rochester.  Jimmy was doing comedy, so we went and did Brother Weez's morning show.  Well, I love Brother Weez.  Weez is doing a morning show for one city, Rochester, New York, and he has a way better setup than we do.  And we're supposed to be like one of the top dogs here at SiriusXM.  We're broadcasting to the entire country, two countries for that matter.  And honestly, this is a shitty setup. 
[00:11:30]  We're just one of many people in this building.  That's what it boils down to.  Weez, one guy for Rochester, New York on regular radio,  has a much, much better setup than we do.  A much better setup.  Another cog in the machine.  And, you know, the guys down the hall, I mean,  are any of them even here to know that we're having problems today?  Of course not.  Why would they be here?  They only technically run the channel.  You know, they keep promising us, oh, we'll take care of it. 
[00:12:00]  It'll be set up.  There'll be no problems with your studio.  And once again, we come in here, and there's problems.  Yeah.  We wanted to watch the news, not listen to some religious call-in show.  And they were scrambling back and forth,  and then we find out that we can't even control our own TVs,  because I guess we're not mature enough.  So the TVs or the cable boxes are in another room,  so then they have to go there and try some things,  and then run back to our studio to see if it works by looking at the TV.  Yeah, shouldn't we be able to just turn a TV on to a certain channel 
[00:12:30]  and then pull it up in the studio and listen to it?  I mean, eh.  It's lunacy.  That seems like the simplest thing would be,  all right, we want to watch Channel fucking 5.  Right.  So we put on Channel 5 on the TV,  and then we pull it up on the board,  and it comes through the studio.  Wow.  That's an amazing concept.  Instead of having to go through some locked room  that we can't even get into, 
[00:13:00]  I don't understand it.  Why do they make things so difficult?  The system is stupid.  I don't blame the engineers,  because the guy helping us today,  I forget his name,  he seems to be a cool guy,  and he seems to like us and stuff.  He's running back and forth going,  well, let me try something else.  I'm like, but the TVs are right here.  He goes, I know,  but they're controlled down the hall in engineering.  And they can't tell,  so they've got to hit some buttons  and then run back in here and look,  and then run back.  It's the dumbest waste of energy.  And does the company  and the people that run this channel 
[00:13:30]  understand we're once again wasting time  talking about how shitty our setup is?  We don't want to be doing this.  I'm sick of bitching.  Oh, better things to talk about today.  But it was a major distraction.  And then my computer, poof, blows up.  I'm scared to ask for another computer from these guys.  I don't know what that'll cost us.  Buy your own.  Get your own.  We probably have to at this point.  You got it.  Just get your own.  That's what I wound up doing.  I will not take anything from this place  as far as if they offer me a phone, 
[00:14:00]  a computer, a this, a that.  No.  I'll get my own shit.  I'll bring it in.  I'll pack it up,  and I'll fucking leave with it  at the end of the day.  Because, first of all,  there's too many strings attached.  They have access to everything.  Like, I have a phone that gets put on their account  and their, you know, email system and everything.  And apparently they own the phone after that.  So, fuck that.  Yeah, they took one of my phones.  Yeah.  They took a really nice BlackBerry phone of mine 
[00:14:30]  because they said they owned it,  even though I bought it and gave it to them  so I could be on their system.  And then when I wanted to upgrade to this new phone,  they said, well, we now own your other phone.  And I'm like, well, no, see, I'm one of seven kids  and I have a lot of brothers and stuff  that don't do as well as me,  so I would really like to pass on  a really nice phone to them.  They never got back to me, by the way.  No.  I gave up on that.  Screw it.  And also, I'm in experiment mode here.  At 5.55, I wrote one of the bosses and said, 
[00:15:00]  hey, I need to talk to you.  It's important.  That's all I wrote.  That's all I wrote.  So we'll see when they get back to us  considering they run the channel.  It's now 6.20.  All right.  We'll see if they even get back to us  within the first hour.  It's a joke is what it comes down to.  It really is.  It's a joke.  Regular radio, Brother Weez, Rochester, New York,  one city he broadcasts to,  they treat him way the fuck better  than we are treated around here.  It's ridiculous.  And they promise us, oh, no,  no one else is going to be using the studio.  Someone was using the studio. 
[00:15:30]  Someone comes in and screws with shit.  Do you even know what channel that was?  We couldn't find it on the cable system.  Oh, why would I listen to some Rasta guy?  Some guy was taking phone calls  and they were talking about God  and it was a Rasta guy.  You're right.  He had some gold Ark of the Covenant in front of him  and a cup of water.  And if you, like, sent money in and your name,  he would put it in the Ark of the Covenant  and you would like a miracle.  That's what you got out of it?  Yeah, yeah.  Where the fuck do you find that programming?  I don't know,  but I found some the other morning also.  I woke up early 
[00:16:00]  and there was somebody selling some miracle water.  I don't know what they were doing,  but it was just a bunch of people  with problems  and apparently if they drank the miracle water  and woke up,  they woke up with no problem.  All the problems were gone.  They were cured of diseases,  out of debt,  cured of drug abuse,  everything.  It was amazing.  Just by sipping on a little holy water?  Yeah.  Is it called holy water officially?  It's called miracle water.  Where the fuck do you get this miracle water? 
[00:16:30]  You got to talk to Dr. fucking Reverend,  what's his name?  I don't know what it is.  Popoff.  But where?  Reverend Popoff was his name.  Where does he get the miracle water?  I guess there's a miracle stream or something.  So why don't we just go get our own damn water?  Why do we have to call him?  He probably prays over it or something.  Oh, he's got to give it a voodoo blessing?  He's got to give it a boost.  He's got to activate it.  He's got to give it a hooli-hooli?  Yeah, if you get it, it's just water.  But if he hooli-hoolies it?  He gives it the old mumbo-jumbo  and then it's holy water. 
[00:17:00]  Miracle water and it cures whatever ails you.  Number nine?  Yeah.  Who did mumbo-jumbo?  Mumbo-jumbo?  Yeah, that song.  Yeah, I don't remember.  Whatever.  But it just amazed me that I was watching  what amounted to a snake oil salesman.  Yeah.  In HD.  Right.  It's the same thing as the old covered wagon  going from town to town selling their elixirs.  And we still can't get on TV. 
[00:17:30]  No.  We're just banned.  We still can't get on TV.  We're just banned.  The other thing that needs to be said  and then we'll move on  is they're doing a free preview,  which is very, very nice.  We're hopefully talking to a lot of new people this week.  Or how long is it?  Like a two-week thing?  Or it's a two-week thing?  I'm getting so many freaking people  writing me on Twitter and elsewhere.  Yeah.  A lot of the cars don't get our channel, you know. 
[00:18:00]  Poor Kay.  Because they got old, like, serious radios.  Oh.  See, the old serious radios don't go up to, like, 197.  Or they do go up to 197, but they don't include 197.  See, when they even gave us this channel,  they didn't believe in us.  They gave us a shitty channel.  They just gave us a shitty channel.  So there are people out there  that want to try to check us out.  Or actually, there are people that know about us already  and they're trying to turn their friends on to it.  Yeah.  That have serious radios,  but their particular radios don't get this channel. 
[00:18:30]  That's just terrific.  I never knew that.  Oh, yeah.  Jay Moore started that whole thing  and I thought he was full of shit.  I'll be honest with you.  But I did some research  and there are radios, an older version,  that don't get 197.  Damn, how old?  Like, those ones that are screwed into your dashboard?  I don't know.  But you would think when they moved us over here  that they would maybe give us a nice channel  that would make sense across the board.  Ah.  So.  Give us part of the spectrum that people don't get. 
[00:19:00]  Huh?  That's good.  Part of the edge, you know.  We're on the edge.  I'm not saying it's a huge problem,  but it definitely is a problem that I've become aware of  that people are definitely not getting this  even though they want to  because their radio doesn't have 197  when they unlock the whole thing.  That's beautiful.  Oh.  Jesus.  So that's today's bitching.  Yeah.  We'll try to keep it to a minimum, but, you know.  Definitely. 
[00:19:30]  Come on.  Whatever.  Whew.  Need to talk to you.  It's important.  Well, we're 28 minutes in.  That's good.  It's good to know the people that fucking babysit this channel  aren't even up yet.  That's great.  Babysit.  It.  Oh, yeah.  Let's get into this Easter thing.  I've got to get rolling on this  because I'm just –  there's so many levels to this story here.  Apparently, in New York, Midtown, Times Square, 
[00:20:00]  Tourist Central, on Easter –  who knew this?  Did you know this?  It's been happening for years, they say.  I know because we talked about it a little bit yesterday.  Yeah.  But –  Go ahead.  Sorry.  Up until yesterday?  I had no idea.  I didn't know.  They said this has been going on since, like, 2006 or something.  It seems that young black people, young black people go bullshit  on Easter Sunday in Times Square. 
[00:20:30]  I'm not going to say young people.  I'm not going to say youths.  I'm not going to say that.  I want everyone to understand what this is.  I'm not going to be like the newspaper.  I'm going to say it's young black people.  Decide to lose their fucking minds in Times Square and commit violent acts against people.  Wait, the news is not saying black people?  No, of course not.  I don't see one fucking thing.  Oh, that's a shock.  I see gang-related.  I see youth. 
[00:21:00]  I see young people.  I see 27 to 55 arrests.  I don't see in one case that it's not white people.  It's black people.  Is this just Times Square, or is it all over New York, or is it all over the country?  How bad is this problem?  One instance at 125th Street on Sunday night.  But about 10 people were arrested.  One man was shot on 125th Street.  But they said 1,000 young people were gathered on 42nd Street after they came out of the car show at the Jacob Javits Center. 
[00:21:30]  Which apparently is what they are calling here, and I quote, a gang magnet.  Well, we've done the car show many times over the years.  No one told us it was a gang magnet.  How about a fucking warning?  That if you're going to take your family to the Javits Center for the car show, that it's a gang magnet. 
[00:22:00]  You might not want to bump into anyone while you're there.  No, you might not want to step on a toe, or look at someone with disrespect, or make fun of someone's tooth, or the grill.  It's a gang magnet?  It's a gang magnet.  You know how many families go there?  You know how many fathers and sons go there to kind of take a look at some rides?  Let's go to the car show, son.  See what kind of concept cars there are.  This is going to be fun.  And then it's just fucking mayhem. 
[00:22:30]  It's a gang magnet.  A gang magnet.  Shouldn't the city put out a bulletin?  Shouldn't Mayor Bloomberg do something?  I don't even know what he does.  Wouldn't you think that there would be a warning put out that says, caution, gang magnets?  That's not a warning.  That's a bulletin.  That's a scroll.  Yeah.  Across the TV.  If you're going to the Javits Center for the car show, you might want to know that it's a gang magnet.  Yeah.  Don't wear red. 
[00:23:00]  Don't wear blue.  Yeah, watch out what color you wear.  Who knows what gang they're from?  Don't bump into anyone.  I have no idea what gangs they're from.  Doesn't say, of course.  I went old school.  I'm sure every color means something now.  Now, you know, and this guy, Michael Daly, I guess, or Daly, whatever the fuck his name  is from the Daily News is writing about Easter night mayhem evokes scarier times and talks  about, you know, the late 70s and the 80s and even into the early 90s in New York City 
[00:23:30]  where they use the word wilding, which, by the way, Bloomberg used to describe this case,  which is nice to see that word making a comeback.  We don't want that word to make a comeback.  He doesn't bring up the fact that these are young black men that are just wreaking havoc  on Easter in an area that is predominantly tourists.  I mean, tourists go to fucking Times Square.  I would say 90% of the people in that area are tourists.  Absolutely. 
[00:24:00]  Not counting the people that have to go down there to work.  No, they're just people wandering around walking.  From Oklahoma with his families going to the Olive Garden think they're eating New York  Italian food.  Right.  That's what you're dealing with.  And then you get young black men that decide that this is a good opportunity to just fuck  people up, shoot guns, and go bullshit for no fucking reason other than I guess they did  it last year and no one did anything and no one said anything. 
[00:24:30]  So the mayor had to know that this happened last year and it could have happened this year.  It says four people shot even though cops anticipated Easter night wilding.  Fifty-six youths busted or sighted.  And then here's a great picture of a little perp walk going on and there's three African-American  males being let out by an officer and they all have their head down and they're flipping  the bird.  They're just giving the finger to the camera that is taking their wonderful picture. 
[00:25:00]  I'm sure it hasn't been the first time as they get led into the precinct station house.  This is what gets me though.  This is like the biggest thing.  Reverend Al Sharpton made a bit of a to-do when Don Imus said nappy-headed hoes.  He said it hurt people.  It hurt people.  It was a terrible thing that he did and he went all out, if you recall. 
[00:25:30]  Oh my God.  Pulled out all the stops to make sure that didn't happen again because people were hurt.  The members of the basketball team were, for Rutgers basketball, female basketball team,  very injured by this shock jock.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, so injured.  It was just horrible.  What a scene.  What a scene of pandemonium it was.  Really?  They wouldn't even have known about it if anyone didn't say anything.  Right.  But where is Reverend Al?  Where is Jesse Jackson? 
[00:26:00]  Where are these black leaders to come out and say this is an awful thing?  Maybe address these black youths and try to find out why they're doing this.  It is damaging.  It is hurtful.  It brings up people's hatred and racism and fears.  This brings up people's what they call irrational fears.  Hey, if you ask me, a thousand black guys running around Times Square shooting people, 
[00:26:30]  to fear that is not irrational.  That is not irrational.  This is a real thing.  This is tangible.  So where are the people that are supposed to address and lead and be the example for  these African-American youths?  Are you saying why is Sharpton not down there on the night before Easter, walking around  on Times Square?  Yeah.  Probably stopping people.  Why isn't he guiding the youth like he's supposed to? 
[00:27:00]  He's not supposed to be an anti-white leader.  He's a black activist.  He's supposed to be active in the causes, in the best interest of black people.  And this doesn't seem to be things that are in the best interest of black people.  And at the very least, he should be on TV today talking about this.  Where is he?  He's hiding, probably.  Where is he?  Because this is a real issue.  If a group of a thousand white people were running around terrorizing black tourists, 
[00:27:30]  I'm certain there would be a problem.  Oh, I am certain there would be a problem.  But this is just business as usual.  They bring up, well, it's, it's, they brought up the word tradition, like it's fucking Thanksgiving  or it's some, you know, Easter tradition, like the bonnet or the basket or the little  Easter dress.  Why isn't there a warning by Mayor Bloomberg or any other city officials that this is becoming  a tradition and you might not want to, you know, take that nice Easter walk with your 
[00:28:00]  family because there's a good chance there's lead flying.  Yeah.  90% chance of lead.  90% chance of lead in Times Square.  So you might want to take your little kid's Easter bag, Easter bag, Easter egg hunting  somewhere else with their little colorful bonnets.  How about you put out a warning that black people are going to, look, they're showing  clips on the news that, that black men predominantly, black, young black people are going to be wreaking 
[00:28:30]  havoc in a public area and you should probably steer clear of it.  Would that be racist if the news got it, if, if CNN or Fox news put out a warning the  night before Easter and said, attention people, black people are going to irrationally go  bullshit on Easter day in Times Square.  So stay clear.  Probably tough to get that announcement made.  You think so?  I think you're right though.  Why? 
[00:29:00]  Because that's what happens.  Why can't you, why can't you warn people as to what will happen?  You're warned of a hurricane coming?  I don't think Anthony's insane this time.  Not at all.  Maybe you can't say it in that way, but certainly could get the word out.  You can get the word out somehow.  It's disgusting how we coddle in this country, how we just coddle and don't want to say anything.  I could read any story in any fucking newspaper about this episode and race will never be brought 
[00:29:30]  up.  But it is, it is exactly about race.  Why do they have to fucking do this?  Why do black youths have to get together and act like fucking animals on Easter and, and  shoot up fucking Times Square like it's the old West?  Why?  Give me a reason.  Give me a viable reason where that makes sense in this society.  And why do we allow it as a society?  Jimmy?  I have a possible reason.  All right. 
[00:30:00]  They don't like the traffic.  Okay.  The traffic needs, uh, so well, at least that's a reason.  I'll look into it.  Can you imagine if they said that was just a protest for the bad traffic on 42nd Street?  Or they don't like Bloomberg's new 40, his new Broadway plan where he's fucking filtered  all traffic?  They don't like that.  I would actually respect that.  I, I, I'm, I'm, I'm outraged.  I'm outraged at the lack of outrage.  So you think Reverend Al should be doing something?  Reverend Al should be doing something.  Jesse Jackson should be doing something.  All the, whatever other black wants to appoint himself a leader and, and talk about things. 
[00:30:30]  Whenever Whitey does something, they're the first ones on the news.  How about you come out and talk about how awful and ignorant this type of action is?  Why don't you call it stupid and ignorant actions on the part of black people?  Why, why don't you do that?  Well, he's too busy going after old radio guys.  Cause that's, that's much more important.  Cause words hurt, Anthony. 
[00:31:00]  Remember the pamphlet?  Words hurt.  Apparently that seems to be a word.  Words hurt.  Bullets don't hurt as much as words.  That's what I learned.  Talk to the people that were shot, which by the way are also black people.  It's more black on black crime, which just is running around.  Why isn't he down there speaking?  Like, why isn't he down there with a megaphone speaking?  Like, why isn't he taking to the streets like he does for every other fucking thing?  Or if he's not speaking, how about you get together with community leaders and discuss  this problem and try to come up with a solution to it?  Like you do whenever a white officer, uh, uh, perhaps tunes up a fucking drug fiend or someone 
[00:31:30]  with a gun, uh, and you cry police brutality.  How about you put together a little blue ribbon commission and, uh, talk about this, uh, problem  that, that there's, uh, uh, a fucking roving gangs running around on Easter in Times Square  shooting up the joint.  After they went to the car show.  Yeah.  Which is a gang magnet.  Which is a gang magnet.  Which I never know.  And they don't even tell us. 
[00:32:00]  Thanks.  How about you tell Whitey?  Because, you know, we need to know these things.  Let's go to Jason in Pennsylvania.  Jason.  Hey guys.  How are you this morning?  All right, brother.  I kind of have an idea why Bloomberg and all those New York officials aren't, aren't telling  people to not go to the car show because of their, because if they don't go, they don't  get as much of a kickback.  Well, exactly.  It's money.  It's revenue.  I understand that.  But how about just Times Square?  How about something where it's like, uh, you know, look out people.  Uh, yeah. 
[00:32:30]  Then the, the, the tourists are going to stop going to the city.  They're going to stop doing all the, you know, fun stuff around Times Square just because,  and then the, the government won't get their money.  Well, then how about they start rousting, how about they start rousting people and profiling  on Easter Sunday?  Hold on, hold on.  Knowing who's committing these fucking atrocities.  I like this guy's point.  Then, then what the city has to do, they have a responsibility.  They get as many cops at the car fucking show to make sure that there's going to be no problems  if they need the revenue that bad. 
[00:33:00]  You can't just let Whitey or, or anybody else just go to the car show thinking it's a safe  environment and, and having no clue that it's a gang magnet.  I didn't know.  No one knew.  The mayor sucks.  Reverend Al sucks.  They all suck.  No one sucks.  No one wants to be honest.  No one wants to address real problems.  It's a lot easier to address, uh, Don Imus, uh, saying something that, uh, offended no one  until someone brought it up.  Yeah.  Let's go to Mark in South Jersey.  Mark.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, look, listen, this problem, uh, was happening over in Philly a few weeks ago. 
[00:33:30]  Uh, the news was referring it as calling a flash mob.  And basically what these kids were doing where, uh, they were getting together on Facebook  and they were just planning massive attacks on, uh, South Street.  Isn't that great?  Yeah.  I, I, I, yeah.  But the, Philly actually did something about it.  Uh, they, they loaded up the...  It's a pillow fight with Glocks, you know.  Yeah. 
[00:34:00]  That's right.  Wonderful.  You've been poked with a hollow point.  Right.  So what did Philly do?  Uh, they, uh, they, uh, they were reporting it on the news.  The news is saying this is a problem.  Be careful.  The cops, um, were all over the streets.  Any kids that were caught doing these flash mob were being charged with felonies and basically  making it very clear.  If you guys do this, you're going to get in trouble.  Look, I, um, I spent a lot of time in New York and Philly at this point.  And I'll tell you this much.  Philly doesn't play. 
[00:34:30]  They don't, they're not as politically correct as New York City.  Yeah.  Simple as that.  They don't fuck around as much as, uh, unfortunately the cops have to here in New York.  And I'm not blaming the cops.  It goes way above the cops in this city.  But in Philly, they don't play at all.  At all.  Well, when your city is called Philadelphia, I think you have to, uh, exert a little more  force.  Yeah.  They don't mess around down there, man.  A couple of pounds of pressure per square inch. 
[00:35:00]  Right.  Per second.  Per second.  Let's go to Reggie.  I didn't hurt one goddamn do-rag on his head.  Let's go to Reggie.  Reggie.  Yo, Reggie.  Ah, Anthony, my nigga.  What's up, man?  What's up?  Ah, how come you weren't at the car show, son?  Ah, I wasn't going to the fucking car show.  That would be a place where you would go, though.  I should have known there was going to be a problem a few years back when I noticed that  it wasn't as many cars, and it was more a show on how many fucking boombox speakers  and fucking bass amps you could fit in your fucking trunk. 
[00:35:30]  That's what the car show's turned into.  Listen, they had escalades down there, son.  They had guns.  It was, oh, I think it was wild.  Yeah, I bet it was fucking insane.  Now, Reggie, as a black guy, did you know that, uh, a lot of gang activities go on at the  car show, or actually just a gang magnet?  No, I'm in Boston.  I told you, I'm in Boston with the white people, man.  Oh, there you are.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, I remember you, Reggie.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Well, Times Square has been known for years now as being the Disney of Manhattan, you 
[00:36:00]  know, the safe place you can go and shop and take pictures and everything.  But it is slowly turning now that the budget cuts are coming in and police are being taken  off of details and stuff.  And you're going to start seeing things like this happen.  The guys are back in full force selling their DVDs and their CDs.  They go out there and it's like, yo, yo.  And they'll hand you a disc of their music and they'll go, yeah, let me sign that for you. 
[00:36:30]  And then they sign it and there's some rube standing there not knowing what's going to  happen.  And then the guy goes, hey, 20 bucks, 20 bucks or eight bucks or five bucks or whatever  it is.  Yeah.  But then they want money for it.  And he goes, and then you go, no, I don't, I don't want, but I would, I didn't want it.  They go, look, I signed it to you, man.  It becomes very menacing and it's, it's, it's passive robbery is what it is.  It's passive robbery.  But at least you get a really good album out of it.  Yeah.  You know, you're getting a blank disc. 
[00:37:00]  No, you're getting some very good songs.  They buy or buy they, I don't know how they acquire the blank discs, but it's a blank  disc.  And then they print out some kind of cover art and slide it into a plastic sleeve and  you get the disc or a paper sleeve.  And then they try to sell this shit to you.  They wouldn't do that because it would hurt their iTunes status.  I'm telling you, I know how these artists work.  Let's go to, let's go to Tommy in Queens.  You know, Tommy, Tommy thinks a lot like you, Anthony. 
[00:37:30]  I'm wondering, is there a way possible that we can, uh, you know, like entice these gang  members around Easter, right?  Bring them to an area, whether it be the Javits Center, whether it be a park in, you know,  in Harlem or something and, and give them more guns and keep them in there.  And maybe they could just shoot each other or teach them to shoot straighter.  And this way they could just do away with all of them.  I think, uh, if, if no one's really going to do anything, we should teach the gang members how to  shoot more accurately.  So more innocent bystanders aren't getting, um, getting shot. 
[00:38:00]  I'm going to start, uh, my charity is teach a gang member to shoot where, uh, you take them to  the range, you take a gang member to the range and you teach them the proper grip, the proper  stance and, uh, identifying your target.  Yeah.  He loves them.  And that way, if, uh, one gang member wants to shoot another gang member, he's on target.  He, he identified his target.  He shoots him.  He kills him.  And then you don't have to worry about grandma getting killed or that. 
[00:38:30]  Why?  What's the matter?  Jimmy could do a comedy show.  What's the matter?  That ain't happening.  Why would I do a comedy show, sir?  Why wouldn't you?  Okay, fair enough.  All right.  Why wouldn't you?  Come on, stop.  You love it.  All right.  Thank you, Tommy.  Let's go to Greg on Long Island.  Greg.  Yeah.  You, you guys say you weren't warned.  I was at a Walmart the other day and they, they announced it over the, you know, now  I should have said all white people out of time.  A couple of things going on. 
[00:39:00]  Very, very good joke there, sir.  But the media spends more attention on some dumb fucking teenager, uh, goofing around and  having a prank at Walmart instead of real issues.  But it's the fact that the racial angle, again, said about the gang, we, we, it's like  the majority of them are black gang members and it's, it's not even addressed at all.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sure there's Spanish gang.  Fine.  But we know the majority of them are black gangs and it's not even said.  It's not.  Nobody says it.  It's not said.  Uh, 20% in crime.  We've got a 20% increase in 2010 so far. 
[00:39:30]  The murder rate so far.  And the murder rate.  Oh, and the murder rate.  Yeah.  That's not, I mean, violent crime is up as well, but the murder rate in New York City is up 20%.  That's weird.  This happens in recessions.  You will see this happen.  It, uh, and now I hear they're going to start pulling cops off of anti-terrorism squads and  putting them, uh, into, uh, crime squads to try to, uh, cut back on this.  But then we leave ourselves open to, uh, terrorism, which is, you know, plus the size of the police  force has, has been shrinking over the last few years.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[00:40:00]  You don't know that when you walk through Times Square, you don't see as many as you did,  uh, like five years ago.  It was pretty much every coroner had two or three well-armed police officers standing  there in Times Square.  Now, not something.  I blame the mayor and the politicians.  They can't even do the right thing for, for the people.  They're out of money.  The state won't give them the money.  Yeah, really?  Yeah, exactly.  Really?  Well, we're holding up our end of the bargain.  I'll say that every fucking day if I have to.  What are you doing for us?  Oh, you're cutting the police force.  That makes sense.  That's terrific. 
[00:40:30]  Absolutely.  Let's say hi to Sean in Georgia.  Sean.  What's up, ONA?  Hey, brother.  First of all, two quick things.  Reverend Al won't say anything to us young black guys because to us, he's irrelevant.  We don't really care about what the guy has to say.  Well, you know what?  You might say that, but he wields a lot of power.  And when he shows up at places, the news is there listening to what he has to say.  And he's just silent when these things happen.  Yeah, they never deny him a spot on TV.  Never.  So he's not irrelevant. 
[00:41:00]  He's irrelevant to you.  But everyone listens to Reverend Al when he decides to talk.  So all we're saying is he should talk about real issues that are going on out there instead  of some dumb old fucking radio guy saying some dirty words or naughty words.  And I love Imus.  I didn't mean to say dumb.  I don't know why that, Opie, but Anthony's saying that he can profile all black guys like  that.  But you can't profile anybody because if we were profiling anybody, we'll be profiling  and as a doggone pedophile because he sent the description to the team. 
[00:41:30]  Who does?  He is.  He's a single white guy, an older white guy.  And, I mean, those are the type of guys that run around and kill young folks.  Let me tell you, here's the difference.  Here's the difference.  Here's the difference, my friend.  Pedophiles don't run around in gangs of a thousand terrorizing children.  Absolutely.  They run around in gangs of one in mansions in Long Island.  And kidnap a little girl.  Every day on the news, you hear about another girl going missing.  A blonde-eyed.  The only people you hear about are the blonde-eyed, blue-eyed girl. 
[00:42:00]  I mean, you know, blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl.  Exactly.  You don't know.  Because the only thing you want to do is, I mean, that's how you profile every time  I see a one-  Exactly.  And it is profiled.  They are profiled, and it's an accurate profile.  So why can't we profile people that just decide to bust into fucking liquor stores or bodegas  with a fucking gun and rob people?  Or wild in Times Square on Easter? 
[00:42:30]  Well, I mean, you can profile, I guess, like that.  But the same way if I see a white guy not holding a woman's hand going down the road,  I'm going to snatch my kids back.  All right.  How about this?  You certainly wouldn't be able to take a trench coat as a white guy in his 40s, fits the profile  of a pedo.  But let's say he's not.  And let's say he's just walking around in elementary school.  He is going to get rousted.  He is absolutely going to get rousted.  How about on Easter Sunday?  We make it so no black people under the age of 40 can enter Times Square. 
[00:43:00]  How about that?  They pretty much do that already.  Do they?  Do they?  Do they?  No, they don't.  They do not.  How come a thousand of them were in fucking Times Square?  They do not do that.  Stop it.  One day you need to do like one of these movies do or get in our shoes and get pulled  over every fucking time.  I get pulled over more times than black people do.  I get pulled over more times than black people.  It's because you're speeding. 
[00:43:30]  It's because I'm fucking speeding like a motherfucker.  And you know what I do?  I'm a courteous son of a bitch.  I don't give fucking lip.  I don't talk back.  And I let the officer fucking look in my car.  He can do whatever he wants.  My guns that I own are legal and legit.  I own legit and they're in my name and they're inside my car legally.  And every time I get pulled over with a fucking gun, like if you get pulled over with your  registration and everything, they'll probably talk to you five or 10, 15 minutes, call  your regi and that's it.  Me?  Shit, I'm going to have to sit there, get out of the car, open my trunk, tear out my 
[00:44:00]  seats, take my speakers out every fucking time and tell me that that happened to you.  You know why?  You know why?  That is a bitch for you, my friend, because 10 guys before you were pulling guns.  Or fucking had weed in their car or whatever.  Whatever the fuck little or great crime was being committed, it was being done by people  that might have fit your profile.  And sorry to say, it's not the cop's fault. 
[00:44:30]  It's other young black men that are ruining it for you.  It's just not right.  All right then, guys.  Punch it out.  All right, ma'am.  Thank you, Sean.  It isn't right, but you know something?  He's right.  It's not right, but.  It's not right, but you know, profiling and just basic human nature and fear and apprehension  comes about when something happens a lot.  If a certain group or a certain thing or a certain anything is frightening you time and time again 
[00:45:00]  or threatening you or does a certain thing that you find appalling, you're going to notice that.  You're going to notice a pattern and you're going to react to it.  That's what's been happening.  What do you think?  It's just for the fuck of it, just, oh, look at this guy.  Ah, fuck him.  Let me give him a hard time.  It's got to be based on something you're saying.  Of course.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We can continue with this, but yeah, it's a big story.  Certainly is a big story. 
[00:45:30]  This Easter Sunday wilding incident in Times Square.  They won't dig deep enough into it.  And you won't see Reverend Al talking about this at all today.  No Reverend Al.  Can't wait for the next nonsense thing he comes out for.  Address this.  It's important to the black community to address this and find out why this is going on.  Uh, forget about Whitey for a while and just dive into this head first there, Al, and find  out why this is happening.  Why young black men are compelled to go into an area like Times Square and just fuck it 
[00:46:00]  up and shoot each other and do whatever the fuck they want.  Because they're not presented with the same opportunities.  Go blow me.  There's a fucking black guy in the White House.  Stop it already.  Who comes running when the cops get out of hand?  Who thinks the mayor's in the Ku Klux Klan?  Yelling and screaming as he's speaking to a mob.  He wears expensive suits, but he doesn't have a job. 
[00:46:30]  Reverend Al, Reverend Al, he's your pal.  Reverend Al, well, he's sapping off the people in his own community.  Why is the white man always picking on me?  He's got a fat belly and his hair's full of grease.  We hear his battle cry.  No justice, no peace.  The man with a plan who you know you can trust. 
[00:47:00]  The portly little reverend with an ass just like a bus.  He's Reverend Al, Reverend Al.  He's your pal, Reverend Al.  He looks like James Brown with too many calories.  Now why is the white man always picking on me?  Remember Bernie Getz in the Brawley case?  Turn on the TV, you would always see his face.  He's speeding in his limo to another homicide. 
[00:47:30]  To make the network news with the family by his side.  Reverend Al, Reverend Al.  He's your pal, Reverend Al.  On a never-ending search for some good publicity.  Why is the white man always picking on me?  Reverend Al, I'm Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's Tommy Brown.  I'm hungry.  He's Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He will represent your family and he doesn't charge a fee. 
[00:48:00]  Now as long as the footage makes it on the TV.  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm your pal.  Well, he's your pal.  That's right, Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's a race, fainting white, hating bag of baloney.  Now why is the white man always picking on me?  Reverend Al.  Yeah, I'm out.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  I'm your pal.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al. 
[00:48:30]  Hey, good morning, everyone.  Dirty Duke beat Butler, huh?  I started watching that game.  I'm like, I can't stay up for this.  I've got to get up for morning radio.  Basketball's still on.  Dude, it turned out to be a great game.  It really did.  I even saw the score and thought, wow, that must have been something. 
[00:49:00]  And wasn't there like a half-court toss at the end?  I don't know.  I didn't even get to.  I saw it like the first, I don't know, 10 minutes of the game.  I'm like, I can't stay up for this.  But Duke defeats Butler 61-59.  God, Butler almost did it.  That would have been one for the ages.  Yeah, like right at the end, he threw a half-court.  Somebody from Butler threw a half-court.  Bomb or whatever?  It hit the backboard off the fucking rim.  Wow.  And then kind of flew off, so they really fucking came close. 
[00:49:30]  So Duke wins their fourth championship, NCAA championship.  You see the Tiger Woods press conference?  Yeah, saw some pieces of that.  It's over.  Now it's done.  Now Tiger Woods will go, well, the Masters start this week.  20,000 people showed up at Augusta just to watch Tiger practice.  20,000 people.  All of his sponsors are going to be crawling back to him.  No one gives a shit, just like we said from the beginning.  No one will give a shit in the end.  They just want to see this guy play golf.  Yep. 
[00:50:00]  And he had a great press conference.  He answered all their questions for the most part.  He was vague about things, but you know what?  That's his right.  Yep.  He doesn't have to answer any questions.  Exactly.  I thought the press in general was a little soft on him.  They didn't go too heavy on the girls and stuff.  Because at this point, what could he or would he say?  You know?  It's like some reporters are going to be like,  so Tiger, tell me about the Perkins waitress.  Like we all know about her.  Yeah.  She had a rag.  She fucking pulled a tampon out.  He came across very likable, and now it's over. 
[00:50:30]  Now he doesn't have to do anything but just play golf now, finally.  And the sponsorships will come back.  Yeah.  I'm not sure the companies that dropped them, but others will certainly take their place within the next year.  Although it was annoying when he goes, now I'm having fun.  Oh, I know.  Before it wasn't fun.  Yeah, it's horrible.  It wasn't.  Having to tough it out with your dick between the tits of a porn chick.  I don't know how you made it out alive, brother.  God bless you.  Yeah, what wasn't fun about it?  You're banging all the hot girls around the country, and you're making millions upon millions of dollars. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, that sounds like the fun.  Playing golf.  Not even going to a shitty job.  Now it's fun.  Now that you just have your wife and the kids and the 80 bodyguards.  Now it's a fucking hoot.  Shut up.  Oh, hoot.  Come on.  You're caught out there.  But Gutfeld again pointed something out on Red Eye last night, which hadn't occurred to me,  but he said, why is the media not questioning him about this racial thing when he was a little kid,  and he said that they spray painted, I think, the word nigger on him in school, which would have been a national story, 
[00:51:30]  because this is 81, not in the 50s, and that there was a big racial incident,  and the school did nothing, and the teacher's saying he's lying.  That didn't happen.  Wow.  And that never happened, and she didn't know about it.  Kindergarten teacher.  She wants an apology.  That's the one we played yesterday.  Oh, that's why she wants the apology?  Because she's like, because Tiger's going, and the teacher did nothing about it.  Right.  And she's going, that didn't happen, or I didn't know about that and do nothing about it.  She feels that her name has been kind of bashed around.  And Gutfeld's like, why are the reporters not asking him about that? 
[00:52:00]  Why is this big racial charge not being addressed at all?  And he's right.  Well, there you go.  But Tiger's press conference was perfect.  It really was.  And now, if he turns around and wins this Masters, it's game over.  Game over.  Then he is truly the most amazing man in sports history.  Yeah.  I don't see that being possible.  I think he's just too rusty.  He hasn't played in any tournaments yet this year.  And playing in tournaments is a lot different than, you know, practicing. 
[00:52:30]  So, I'm going to be watching.  I can't wait for Thursday.  Yeah.  I'll watch every fucking stroke of his.  Ooh.  With the Perkins waitress.  I did tweet that he's going to be playing with blue balls this year at the Masters.  Yeah.  He's used to getting rid of the poison.  You think he's jacking it a lot?  Uh.  That he has to be.  Yeah.  If you're used to just fucking coming.  You think he's back to having.  You think he's back to having.  You think he's back to having sex with his wife?  Because she's going to be there.  No.  You don't think so?  No.  No fucking way.  He'll try some dirty shit with her and she'll be like, I'm not your porn girl. 
[00:53:00]  You think that's what you did with her?  You think they're at least sleeping in the same bed and he's trying to rub up against her a little bit?  I don't even know.  Trying all those I'm in high school moves.  I don't even know if they're sleeping in the same bed.  That's just one of those situations where it's.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  What?  You know what?  Good for Tiger.  I mean, he finally had the press conference he should have had a long time ago.  Just be honest with the people.  Answer as much as he wanted to.  And now it's time to move on. 
[00:53:30]  How can you not cheat after that, though?  Like, how can you not?  Maybe for, you know, six months or eight months.  But, man, how can you not start fucking again?  Because your wife's got the kids.  It's a whole thing.  It's like she's mad at him.  She's not going to want to fuck him.  Yeah.  He seems to really want to fuck.  He's pulling tamps out and throwing him in his own driveway.  Oh, fuck.  You know, she's going to find a Perkins tampon in her fucking gutters.  She's flinging him up in the air. 
[00:54:00]  Now, we got the Tiger Woods press conference audio.  We don't have to play all this, but let me read some of the subjects and tell me if it's worth playing.  Okay?  You got Tiger had a great day.  He was talking about being on the golf course.  Tiger explains why the doctor that was giving out performance-enhancing drugs went to his house.  Because there was some suspicion that he was doing some illegal shit with drugs.  Yeah.  To rehab his bad knee.  He explained that.  Tiger explains his Ambien and Vicodin use.  Really?  Yeah.  Let's do that one.  Engineering does not have extra screens for these mics. 
[00:54:30]  They need to be ordered.  How would Tiger say that?  Could someone douche one out?  Like, get an intern to fucking, like, wash it.  You know what?  I want to wash it.  Well, not even the one I was using.  No, no, no.  That one was beyond cleaning.  But these mic screens, I want to be able to smell my own bad breath, not someone else's.  When you do radio and you've got these mic screens, see how you're freaked out, Jimmy?  I can't even fucking...  I know what I'm smelling right now is not my bad breath. 
[00:55:00]  It's somebody else's.  And I really don't feel like dealing with that after 20-some-odd years in radio.  Get me my own fucking mic screen.  There was food and hair in mine.  Yeah.  Now, I eat a salad here, but not in the mic.  I put the mic away and like that.  There was food and then hair stuck in that fucking thing.  I couldn't look at it anymore.  Would you lick in the little grooves of the microphone?  Yeah, no.  Jimmy, smell this mic screen.  No way.  Under no circumstance would I smell that. 
[00:55:30]  But this is what you have to deal with every day.  So we asked, I don't know, can we have our own mic screens?  And now that's an issue.  No, they have to order extra screens.  I want my own mic screen that they put on my stupid microphone every morning.  That's not asking for much.  That's it.  And then I'll smell my own bad breath and I'll feel like I'm at home.  Put a little fucking color code in there so they know which one is each of ours and everything.  And then you pop it right on.  I don't feel like smelling other man scents.  No, and sometimes you've got to put your mouth right on the mic like that. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  You want to smell it to me?  No, because comedy club microphones I talk into every night.  They're fucking horrendous.  They're bad, right?  They're horrendous.  Oh, God.  I can sometimes tell who's been on stage before me by the smell of the mic.  Oh, fuck.  Does it smell like Vicodin or alcohol?  If it's wings, it's Colin.  If it's fucking, or Keith.  If it's cum, it's Bob Kelly.  By the way, who's coming in.  Remind me to ask him about the trees that we discussed last night.  Oh, really?  There's trees that are making Bob throw up in the city. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, was it the cum trees?  Oh, he talked about them?  I read his Twitter.  I don't know what it is.  What the fuck is a cum tree?  I don't know.  We're going to have to talk to him.  All right, that's a good tease.  All right, here's to...  But he literally, I was with him next to one, and he's like...  Can we bring that in right now?  Dude, it's all I'm thinking of.  Where are the trees so we can bring them in?  They're all over the city.  They're the white trees.  They have little white flowers.  A little white...  They're all over New York.  Every tree has a little white shit on them right now because they're budding.  I know. 
[00:57:00]  They got little buds.  Buds.  Little nubs.  They're little nubs.  They're going to turn into big grass.  Danny, if someone could bring up some photos of like city trees, I'll show you which ones  there are.  They do smell like cum.  Well, fucking get some, man.  Oh, Bob's pointing at one.  Oh, that's cute.  Bob's pointing at one on his Twitter.  On his Twitter.  Bob has video Twitter.  He looks good, doesn't he?  Not really.  Oh, look at Bob.  He's smelling them.  We got to get those.  We got to get them and hide them under his mic screen.  Could someone go out and get that, please?  All right.  Hide them under his mic screen.  Here's Tiger.  Why did I whisper that?  Tiger explaining his Zambian and Vicodin use. 
[00:57:30]  It's been reported that you took the prescription drugs, Zambian and Vicodin.  Can you speak to when you started taking those, how you needed them for tournament golf if  you did, and if you ever became addicted to either one of them or received treatment?  I've taken them, yes.  I've had some, as everyone knows, pretty interesting knee situations over the years.  I've had, what, four operations now in my left knee.  And then last year with my torn Achilles, it hurt quite a bit at times. 
[00:58:00]  And, yeah, I did take that.  And I took most of the time I was on the Ambien was, you know, when my dad was sick and when  my dad died.  That was a tough time in my life.  And so that's when, yeah, I was taking some of those things to help me sleep.  And that's about it.  He's got to have an excuse, though, for all that.  I've never heard anybody talk about Vicodin and not bring up some type of injury, back 
[00:58:30]  pain, knee pain, something like that.  It's always some kind of pain.  Tari won't say what his rehab was for.  Good.  I was glad you didn't answer that.  It's amazing how these guys, like, why is his personal life, like, Gloria Allred, I fucking  hate that woman.  Because all she does is hook up with these fucking, these women who I think are vultures.  Yep.  And, like, she's going after this guy.  It's like, what about your fucking personal life?  Like, when's the last time you had a dick in your mouth or inside of your ass? 
[00:59:00]  Have you ever, like, why is she or any of these fucking.  Imagine if she was open to answering any of that.  I would, if I said that to her.  How quick would you turn off the TV?  I'd listen in a second.  First of all, she has hair like Emilio Estevez, and I think it's important to address that.  But I would love to say to her, when's the last time you had a cock in your mouth?  And for her to, then she goes, ah, I'm not going to, oh.  Like, why should your personal life be personal?  Not dignify that with a response.  Yes.  Tiger says he missed his son's first birthday, whatever. 
[00:59:30]  And then you got, Tiger says he didn't know if he actually wanted to get caught.  And with all of the reports that have come out with him.  With seemingly a lot of loose ends with all, with the things that you did.  With, whether it be text messages or whatever those things would be.  It leads to wonder why you would have leave so many loose ends.  And is there almost some element of you that wanted to get caught?  I don't know.  All I know is I acted just terribly, poorly. 
[01:00:00]  Made just incredibly bad decisions.  And decisions that have hurt so many people close to me.  And that's enough.  This tiger is a strange bird.  Because now he sounds human.  Like, when he did this, what, a month ago?  With that weird statement?  He looked like a robot.  Sounded like a robot.  No emotion.  And now he's like a regular guy here.  Quote regular.  I mean, he's like, you know what I mean?  More of a regular guy. 
[01:00:30]  Answering his questions.  And I understand he's answering them.  It's a business.  It's the reality is for the endorsements to come back, the media has to lay off.  I mean, again, he's a smart guy.  He's not a dumb guy at all.  But for that reporter just to stand there and ask about it, it's like, that's none of  your fucking business, motherfucker.  Why he texted somebody.  He's got a wife.  Let them fucking deal with it.  That's a smarmy reporter.  Do you think maybe you were, what the fuck is your business, what he was thinking while  he was fucking somebody behind his wife's back?  None of your business.  I want Tiger to give the whole world a booyah and win this Masters. 
[01:01:00]  I would love for him to fucking win the Masters.  Sinks the final putt and just goes, booyah.  Booyah.  Fuck yous all.  I'm still the greatest.  You know what?  I wish him nothing but the best now.  I mean, I always did.  I mean, it was interesting, but now I just want to see him win tournaments again because  I love watching him fucking play golf.  It does make him interesting again.  Like, at first it was the idea of a black golfer.  Look, that made me interested because you didn't see that.  And then he became the best.  And he was so good it became boring. 
[01:01:30]  You're like, all right, there's the guy in the sweater and the fucking Nike hat winning  again.  Fuck him.  And now, oh my God, he's been fucking out as well.  Now he's interesting.  Now he's interesting again.  Interesting.  Okay, he loses all these sponsorships.  Just a thought really quickly here.  When Tiger plays in these tournaments, it's a known fact that the golf ratings are huge.  And when Tiger blows off a tournament, the golf ratings drop, right?  Yep.  Why wouldn't a sponsor make it like a last minute deal with Tiger and get some kind of  emblem on his bag, on his hat, on his shirt? 
[01:02:00]  I don't know.  I don't know what Tiger would agree to because these ratings are going to be ridiculous.  Huge.  It's going to be one of the biggest sporting events of all time.  It really is.  Yeah.  Especially if he could hang in there and have a chance to win in this whole thing.  You're looking at monstrous ratings for this thing.  Well, it's monstrous.  So why, as a sponsor, why wouldn't you try to make some kind of deal and go, whoa, dude,  we want to be on your bag or on your caddy's hat or something?  Because that's all they're going to show.  They're not going to give a shit about any other golfer.  They'll show other golfers while Tiger's just fucking walking in between holes. 
[01:02:30]  Thinking about them, why they haven't done that yet.  Nike stuck with them.  My guess is because they want to make sure it's over.  They're afraid that all of a sudden they'll sign on and something else will come out.  That's my guess as to why they're not doing that.  Good point.  And speaking of this, one of his fucking girls was in town, that Jocelyn.  Which one?  Jocelyn James.  How much fucking attention does she need?  A lot.  God almighty.  What was she doing in Manhattan?  She was filming.  What was she doing?  Just something else, which is on the fact that his cum hit her in the face. 
[01:03:00]  It's like, what are you doing?  Do we know why she was here?  Do you have no fucking dignity at all?  I'm going to dance 50 miles from where he is.  It's like, let it go.  Let it go, you fucking pig.  I don't blame her for fucking a married guy.  Fine, I don't care about that.  But let it go.  He went back to his wife.  Move on.  Yep.  Holy shit.  Yeah, that's all it is.  It's like fucking attention whore.  She's saying she's going to go back to porn. 
[01:03:30]  Good.  That's what she should do.  What happened?  And the fucking career in law or as an author didn't work out?  Here we go, Jimmy.  This will enrage you.  The X-rated actress and exotic dancer swooped into New York yesterday with man-eating lawyer  Gloria Allred to once again declare Woods' public statements are one putt short of the  whole.  They watched this televised press conference at the Friars Club and hooted their disapproval.  God, I hope she blew Pat Cooper, man, because Pat Cooper's got some fucking sperm building 
[01:04:00]  up.  You think Pat Cooper was at the Friars Club yesterday?  Yeah, but he wouldn't have gotten anything.  Ready for this?  He can't get hard.  He's still a big, fat liar, she said, after Tiger claimed he had gained perspective after  the birth of his children.  She said she and Woods hooked up 10 days after his daughter was born.  This fucking pig just won't shut her mouth.  She's fucking, again, move on.  You fucking, once again, have attached yourself to men and made yourself fucking, you know, 
[01:04:30]  used your pussy in your mouth to become famous.  Fine.  I love porn girls.  I always back them up.  I don't shit on porn girls.  But now that he's fucking back with his wife, sometimes they do, yes.  That pesky saran wrap.  I'm like, it's such an intimacy remover.  I'll take the log right out of the old forehead.  I'll wear it like a fucking visor.  Like a dog playing cards in the poster.  But it's like, why do you have to keep it going?  Just fucking shut your mouth.  Leave it alone.  You're done.  You're done. 
[01:05:00]  You had your moment in the sun.  Go away now.  Let it go, woman who contributes nothing as a fucking artist or a performer.  Let it go.  My relationship with Tiger was never about money.  Wait for this.  You could say that again.  All those times he flew you around the country so he could have sex before tournaments.  Did he ever fly you first class?  No, he never did.  You were nothing to the Tiger Woods, you pig.  He's known as being a little cheapy.  Oh, yeah.  He is a chiseled.  He probably flew around JetBlue like, yeah, there is no first class. 
[01:05:30]  Over the three-year relationship, did he ever give you a gift, a bracelet, stud earrings?  I'm not really a big jewelry person.  No.  Unless it's a pearl necklace.  And that means no.  Right.  Okay.  Still defending the sex-created golfer.  Birthdays?  Well, he told me happy birthday once, said James.  That's nice.  That was enough for me.  Happy birthday, suck my cock.  Yeah, exactly.  No, but he was actually humming happy birthday, but he didn't know it was hers. 
[01:06:00]  He was humming happy birthday to me as he was blown alone in her face.  Come on, girl.  Not even flowers for someone.  Woods repeatedly said he loved.  The guy's a billionaire.  And he's texting you the grossest stuff we've ever seen.  Who said that?  This Joanna Malloy.  Oh, she must be a great fuck.  Oh, she's one of the gossip fucking pigs.  She must be a great fuck.  She's a gossip pig.  If she thinks that's the grossest stuff ever.  The tiger wants to stick his dick in her ass in her mouth.  Uh, grossest stuff we've seen since Bodacious Ta-Tas 9. 
[01:06:30]  She didn't write that, did she?  Of course she did.  She's just a woman who's probably out of touch.  Almost on the front page, by the way.  Out of touch.  Bodacious Ta-Tas.  It's not funny or sexy or accurate.  And he can't send you some gratitude posies.  Why don't they have fucking broad writers in papers?  What are you doing? 
[01:07:00]  They're terrible writers.  You don't like broad writers?  Yeah.  Oh, some posies.  Who the fuck laughs at that?  She wrote posies.  Fucking dumb broad.  Funny broad.  It's fucking horrible.  Scrub a toilet.  Get Joanna Molloy or whatever.  She's terrible.  Oh, this is Russian Molloy or whatever.  Oh, is it?  She's fucking awful.  Get her on the phone, please.  Posies.  I guess he's a tightwad, so to speak, James admitted.  What James wants is R-E-S-P-E-C-T, and she spelled it out on the paper. 
[01:07:30]  R-E-S-P-E-C-T.  She probably thought she was going to get it at his first confessional when Woods apologized  to family, friends, fellow golfers, corporate partners, kids around the world, and Joe blowed  down the block.  Did they actually think that they were going to get apologies to these stupid girls?  I want to read this whole thing now.  Not a word about James or the 14 other women who have come out of the woodwork, so to speak.  Has James apologized to every fucking guy who liked her in her porn movies, who she probably 
[01:08:00]  was fucking sexy to?  Has James apologized to every guy she ever let on when she was fucking stripping?  Yeah.  How about that?  Does that twat apologize to every guy who thought he had a shot with her when she was  exotic dancing?  Because she's probably a great dancer, and she probably knows how to be sexy.  I guess she owes an apology and money back to every guy that fucking tipped her because  he thought he was going to go home and fuck her.  Oh, no, that's not the way it works?  Sorry.  You led me on, you.  You guys brushed past the wonderful writing of this broad.  She's good.  Not a word about James or the 14 other women who have come out of the woodwork, so to speak. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, is it another pun?  Another fucking wordplay?  Oh, if it looks like it's a hole, then where is it?  Yesterday, at the all-male Georgia, B-A-S-T-I-O-N?  Bastion.  Bastion, right.  Okay, that is Augusta National.  He forgot them again.  In 12-step rehab for any addiction, you're supposed to make amends to the people you've  hurt, James said.  They're pulling that one out of the hat. 
[01:09:00]  All these dumb bitches are pulling out the, you know, you're supposed to apologize to everyone  you heard and say, shut up.  Eventually.  Yeah, right.  Give him some time.  That's a fucking month after, you fucking idiot.  You know anything about 12-step work?  It takes a while.  You got to go through the fucking, that's like the eighth and ninth step.  It's like running upstairs.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.  Yeah, oh, I just, I feel, I'm sorry.  Like, the second he gets out of rehab, I apologize to the porn girl who I came on.  Shut up.  You want more from?  She's down the list a little ways. 
[01:09:30]  No.  You want more from this broad?  Oh, she's, yeah, she's a who?  She's a panic, this one.  Yes, these consulting adults knew he was married, and yes, some of the women are hookers, or  like James, have acted in porno films.  My God.  Still, sex workers are people, too.  Certainly are.  Who wrote this?  Bob McAllister?  Sex workers are people, too.  A drink to goo, drink to goo, drink to goo.  Oh, what a hack.  No one's saying that she's not a fucking person, but she is a person, but again, it's like just 
[01:10:00]  time to let it go and move on.  She's barely a person.  I don't know.  You know, look, she took a bunch of cum.  I respect that.  She's barely a person.  Yeah.  She's probably a good lay.  I know your place.  You're a cum dumpster.  Yeah.  At the Masters, Woods has got to be haunted by the 15 other women, not to mention his wife,  his mother, and even his kindergarten teacher, all of whom he has ticked off.  He fucked.  He fucked.  He ticked off all those people. 
[01:10:30]  Ticked off.  Hey, that totals 18.  Oh, boy.  Here comes the golf joke.  Here it comes.  Anyone want to try it?  18.  She writes, hey, that totals 18.  Um, that's one for every bad joke I've written in this article.  One for each hole on the course.  That's it?  Literal douchebag?  God, does she suck?  Even Woods' powers as an automaton, excuse me, can't block out that much.  Maybe that's why he has been wearing wraparound shades. 
[01:11:00]  Have you seen one picture with, maybe it's sunny out.  Yeah.  Have you seen Tiger in wraparound shades?  The front page has Tiger without fucking sunglasses on and the paper you're writing for,  you dumb broad.  But peekaboo, James is coming to Georgia this week.  Like, she's going to dance at the legendary Atlanta strip club, the Pink Pony.  And she wants an apology, really?  Yeah.  Really?  For what?  As you exploit it for your own fucking game? 
[01:11:30]  Oh, God.  She's going to dance at the legendary Atlanta strip club, the Pink Pony, and managers have  thoughtfully posted directions from Augusta on the website, on their website.  By the way, this Pink Pony is not even close to where fucking Tiger's playing golf, okay?  I would understand if it was right outside the course in town or whatever.  Whatever the hell's around there.  But you've got to go quite a distance to find this place.  As Woods sharpens his game, we're almost done, James will be practicing her fireman spin  around the pole.  As he hits long drives, she'll be doing the body wave with a cheeky flourish. 
[01:12:00]  A cheeky?  What?  What a terrible fucking writer this woman is.  She's one of the gossip fucking things, though, man.  What is it about being gossip lady that makes you a terrible writer?  She gets some prime space every day in the paper.  She's fucking horrendous.  Cheeky.  I've got some really, really great costumes I'm really excited about, including a patriotic  tearaway outfit dedicated to her friends serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, well, thank God she's helping.  Yeah.  It's great.  At least she should have been in the sights of that Apache footage that I saw last night.  Goodbye, whore.  And this is what it's all about.  Here you go, Jimmy.  There's also a peel-off homage to Woods.  A furry tigress costume, perhaps?  Oh, God.  Oh, James Mewed Slyly.  I don't want to ruin the surprise.  One dumb broad writing about another dumb broad. 
[01:13:00]  I've had it with both of these hens.  That's it.  Shut up.  It's an homage.  I've never had more fun reading in my life.  It's so stupid.  How did I say it wrong?  It's an homage.  Homage, sorry.  She's a terrible writer, though.  It's like this cutesy...  Sorry.  It's just this cutesy writing.  It's fucking embarrassingly bad.  Trying to make it fun.  The media's fucking...  They really are terrible.  She's just trying to make it fun, Jim. 
[01:13:30]  So people could read it and get a few chuckles from her clever writing.  Ugh.  Can we get her on the phone?  For what?  Looking for a contact info.  Exactly.  What do you say to her?  You write like shit.  Yeah, exactly.  When did you try to be...  She might be checking her email, maybe.  She's a humorist.  Here we go.  Here we go.  So that's it.  I wish Tiger nothing but the best. 
[01:14:00]  And I hope he wins this fucking tournament.  It'll be one of the greatest sports stories ever, man.  Yeah, he...  Yeah.  I hope he either wins or really stinks now.  Yeah.  Like, completely sucks.  Where he starts thinking, look, I gotta fuck a lot of women in order to be good at golf.  I think they're saying, because, you know, they're practicing a lot in Augusta, and he did a practice round, and they're saying he's not looking that good.  No?  Some of the experts are like, yeah, he's, you know, he's got some work ahead of him, so... 
[01:14:30]  Experts.  Yes.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Mm-hmm.  It just drives me nuts.  Let's say hi to Joe in Boston.  We'd love to watch somebody fucking swing by the neck.  You know what?  We'd love it.  It would drive me more nuts if we didn't have a radio show.  At least we could, you know, yell and scream about these dummies in the media.  Let's go, Joe.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  What's up?  Hey, listen, I think Tiger Woods should apologize to this kindergarten teacher bitch, just like George Costanza's nemesis had to apologize to him for stretching out the neck of his finely knit sweater. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, that's going, um...  Was that a good Seinfeld reference, Sam?  It's pretty deep.  You know your Seinfeld.  It's deep.  Travis is the king of Seinfeld.  Was that a good reference, Travis?  Well, yeah, but he didn't apologize to George.  No.  So, it kind of doesn't.  That was the whole gist of it.  Sorry.  All right.  Travis is like the king of Seinfeld. 
[01:15:30]  Like, they got the...  What's the name of that game?  Seen It.  Seen It.  Me and Danny played.  It was really fun.  Seen It.  Seinfeld edition.  It was so much fun that, like, I didn't even get a chance to play because he was just answering the questions, and then it was his turn, and then he'd answer first.  You know, go to the next turn.  He knows every...  He answered first.  He knows every single answer, and I'm frightened to play him.  He basically just sat there for 15 minutes and just watched him play with himself.  Yeah.  Watch.  You get to sit there and watch how much he knows.  You just watch how much he knows about Seinfeld. 
[01:16:00]  You might as well just sit there and have him spout off Seinfeld knowledge.  Yuck.  Do you know, I literally know nothing about Seinfeld.  Really?  Ask me a very basic Seinfeld trivia question that anybody should know.  What is Elaine's last name?  Nardo.  Taxi.  That's a good question.  I don't know.  I think it was based on Elaine Boosler, the comedian, the real comedian, but Elaine, I have no fucking idea.  Wow.  I don't even know.  Yeah, I'm curious.  I really don't know.  Really?  Yeah.  Penis. 
[01:16:30]  Elaine Penis.  I've heard that before, and I have heard that.  Yeah.  That's an easy one.  Not for us.  Exactly.  I was too busy doing radio.  That was the nighttime attitude years.  Oof.  Did you have a nighttime attitude?  Shit.  Oh, I sure did.  A nighttime attitude.  I had an attitude, and it was nighttime.  Watch out.  Watch out.  It was a fucking nighttime attitude, really.  Obama throws out the first pitch.  So last year, he was in his mom's genes, and he had a horrendous pitch to home plate, 
[01:17:00]  and he didn't do much better this year, right, Amp?  No, it looked horrible.  It looked like, I'd say it kind of looked like a pop-up behind the plate that the catcher  had to back up a little for and go way right and then catch it.  It was real high.  It was like, yeah, it was like a bloop.  Way, way.  You know what I mean?  It was like a...  Way to his left.  He's, uh...  Jimmy said it yesterday. 
[01:17:30]  Obama's just a nerd.  He's not...  He is.  He's not good at athletics.  You know that?  I wonder if anyone else saw this.  On Sunday, they're all the same people to me, but one of these big-time fucking...  Oh.  ...media guys...  ...was interviewing Obama at the White House.  And they were trying to make it casual.  Like, he had his casual wear on.  Of course.  And the reporter had his casual wear on.  And they have him at the basketball court while they're answering questions.  Yeah.  And if I'm not mistaken, maybe someone can back me up. 
[01:18:00]  Tyler, sorry.  Obama took, like, three jump shots during this interview.  Two were air balls.  And one hit the front of the rim really hard.  He's not good at anything.  He's not good, but they show him playing basketball like he's really good at that or something.  Yeah.  He sucks.  I played many years of basketball.  Obama would be embarrassing.  You would pick him last.  You know, I did for president.  He can't...  He can't play hoops, and he certainly can't throw a baseball.  He's had two shots at it now. 
[01:18:30]  He came out to throw out the first pitch for the Nationals.  He was wearing a Nationals jacket.  And he then got the crowd going because he pulled out his White Sox hat.  And he put the White Sox hat on.  I was wearing the Nationals jacket.  So everybody was like, ooh.  Wacky Obama.  And Obama laughs a little.  And then he does a little wind-up.  And proceeds to just throw the ball way too high.  This huge arc.  It's like a knuckleball getting away from the pitcher. 
[01:19:00]  You know what I mean?  Oh, yeah.  It was just horrible.  Way, way high and way to his left.  We got to go back to this broad that's stripping close to Augusta.  Because I was waiting for somebody.  Burt in Augusta.  Go ahead, Burt.  Hey, guys.  Burt Nernies.  What's up?  It's like 150 miles between Augusta and Atlanta.  See, the media is making a big deal that this broad is stripping close to the Masters.  That's what they refuse to tell you because it's not a good story if you know the strip club is 150 miles away from where Tiger is playing golf. 
[01:19:30]  150 miles.  Yeah, they want it to sound like she's dancing in the gallery.  That's two to two and a half hours in a car.  Exactly.  Thank you, sir.  Hey.  Yeah.  They were showing him on the local news.  He looks like he's put on about 25 pounds since the last time.  He looks all roided out.  Really?  Yeah, he kind of looks like Evil Tiger again.  Yeah, he looks like him.  Yeah, he doesn't look fat.  He just looks kind of like a Mark McGuire thing happening. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, really?  He's getting kind of big?  I don't know what's going on.  You're right.  Bit of controversy.  Do you think he'd get in trouble if he went to watch her dance?  How great would that be?  Watch it out, guys.  After all this.  You're with a fucking Cialis hard on, just tenting in his golf slacks.  After the mea culpa.  I love mea culpa.  He's wearing the green jacket.  Yeah.  Getting her fucking cum all over it.  Yeah, it's got a fucking snail trail on the arm.  It's got her cum all the way up the fucking elbow.  Gives it back to Jack Nicklaus. 
[01:20:30]  Here you go.  Here's your green jacket back.  Do you see what Obama does with his knees when he shoots?  Oh, is this it?  Watch.  He gets like knock-kneed.  Is this the same footage?  I'm not really sure.  When he goes to shoot.  No, this is a...  He looks really silly.  Yeah, but this is different.  But he just is not good.  He can't make a basket for shit.  He hasn't made one yet in this footage.  He's right up to the basket. 
[01:21:00]  There you go.  Oh, my God.  He's right under the basket that time.  There you go.  I challenge Obama to a one-on-one.  Really?  I think I could get that done.  I think that'll happen.  Why?  If he's going to have a beer with some guy in Boston, he could fucking play me one-on-one.  I know you've had the daydream before, though.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, a radio host does something charitable, and Obama notices it, and they have like a  one-on-one charity thing.  Hey, you want to play some b-ball out back? 
[01:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  Let me give that.  I would kick his ass in basketball.  You'd have to.  I officially challenge the president of the United States to a one-on-one.  Make that happen.  How do we do that?  He shouldn't even have to be able to be good.  Huh?  He's the president.  Who cares if he could play basketball?  I'd rather he not play.  Why?  I don't like his slow trot run everywhere he goes, and he doesn't move fast at all.  Yeah.  Did I say?  Dude, he really does this wacky thing where his knees touch when he bends down to, like, 
[01:22:00]  right before the shot.  He looks silly.  I know.  I did the math.  Someone's calling me Leadfoot Opie.  That's averaging about 70 miles an hour to get to the strip club.  Yeah, I know.  Two to two and a half hours.  Yeah.  So?  It's a long drive.  You can do 70 miles an hour on a highway.  Yes.  What's that?  70.  That's easy.  It's in traffic.  You can still text really well at 70 miles an hour.  Of course.  I start losing my texting ability around 80. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, then you've got to really kind of pay attention.  Around 80, then I'm a little nervous.  Then I have to really make sure.  I'm very upset with Obama also.  What day is this?  Yeah, any day.  Any day of the week.  Why are you upset with him today?  Because he's decided to tell everybody when and when not the United States would use the nuclear option.  He's been on this, you know, no nukes thing and making deals with Russia and whatnot. 
[01:23:00]  And that's all fine and well and dandy.  But the policy of the United States has always been everything is on the table at all times.  That's been the best way throughout the years to deter people from doing things.  It's like, well, would a nuclear strike be an option if, and then the president goes, look, we have everything on the table and that decision would have to be made when it would be made.  But Obama is saying now he wouldn't use nukes in certain situations. 
[01:23:30]  And even if the United States was attacked with biological warfare, he still would not use the nuclear option.  Why would you rule that out public?  What are you doing?  I know.  It's the weakest thing you can do.  Don't say that.  We got him.  Don't say you're not going to use him.  I'd be like, I'm using for anything.  Someone fucking doesn't like the way I play basketball. 
[01:24:00]  I'll fucking nuke him.  Anything.  Whoa, that means me.  You want me to be nuked?  Well, no, because my house was close enough where it would get some collateral damage.  Of course.  Yeah, he, it's dumb.  It's just a dumb move.  You got nukes, you know, especially when you got fucking Iran working on their shit.  You got North Korea working on their shit.  You don't then start talking about situations where you're not going to use them. 
[01:24:30]  He's a weak guy when it comes to foreign policy.  He wants to be liked too much by the foreign leaders, and that's a direct sacrifice to  our own security.  So, fuck him.  Fuck him.  What is Geraldo doing in the middle of Afghanistan?  I don't know.  Giving away positions?  With a phone from 1980.  He's got a sat phone.  I know.  Talking to Gordon Gekko.  Gordon Gekko.  U.S. forces focus Afghan war on Taliban strongholds.  Yeah.  Did you see the footage of the Iraq, the Apache helicopters taking out the two Reuters? 
[01:25:00]  No.  Where do you see that?  Uh, it's, uh, I guess I clicked the link somewhere.  Is it, well, explain.  It's available.  Help me out.  Well, there were, uh, a group of gentlemen walking down the street, and, uh, there was  a couple of Apache helicopters on, on site, and, uh, of course, they can't see them or  hear them.  They're just walking around.  And, uh, uh, two of these guys were Reuters reporters, and one was a Reuters cameraman. 
[01:25:30]  He's holding his camera with a strap over his shoulder, and I believe they had a lock  on him and said, you know, that guy's got a weapon.  They thought it was a weapon.  It was his camera.  Now, other guys in the group did have weapons.  They did have weapons.  Uh, one guy had an RPG.  Another guy had an AK.  Um, so I guess these Reuters guys were, in essence, embedded.  With these insurgents.  Uh, now they're making a big stink over the fact that they killed these two Reuters guys, 
[01:26:00]  but it's kind of like, you know, hey, we've had a couple of our reporters blown up.  Um, it's, it's part of war reporting that that's going to happen.  And now they're playing all the, the audio and video of, of the, the chatter between the  Apache and base and everything.  And it sounds, you know, not too, it doesn't sound.  Because they're like, oh, look at all the fucking bodies down there. 
[01:26:30]  Nice.  You're going, holy shit.  Light them up.  You know, fucking tear into them.  Shoot them.  Kill them.  It's like, give me permission to fire.  Like, they're, they're mad.  They want to fucking unload on me.  So the Reuters guys want to, want to be with insurgents and carry things on their shoulders  and they want to be not shot.  Yeah, exactly.  It doesn't make sense.  It doesn't at all.  And, and then a van pulls up and, uh, before, uh, there's an American convoy coming to check  out the bodies.  So a van pulls up and starts removing the bodies.  So the Apaches is still looking going, Hey, give me permission to open up on this van. 
[01:27:00]  Here's the footage.  We're watching it now.  And they finally got permission.  It turned out two kids were in the van also.  Uh, but there were, there were men in the van.  Now that's the guy they lock onto.  And they think that's a weapon.  Said.  Said.  And, um, that's Namir.  With camera?  And he's got a camera.  They do look like weapons.  They look like weapons.  And there's a couple of guys that do have weapons in this group.  Uh, and one of them has an RPG.  Wow. 
[01:27:30]  Is he locked onto him?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they start going around, but a building blocks him.  He gets, he gets, uh, permission to open fire, but the building is in the way.  So he has to sweep back around and then just, oh, do they unload on these guys?  You should turn up the, um, should turn up the volume.  Yeah.  Let's check this out.  I can't get them now because they're behind that building. 
[01:28:00]  These are the Apache pilots.  See, look at the guy with the RPG.  And you just know when they come around this side of the building, all hell is going to  break loose.  See, he's pissed.  They're all on that side.  Once they come around, look at the group of guys that they have a shot on. 
[01:28:30]  It's just a giant group of gentlemen.  Now he turns and, hi, guys.  Look at this now.  Well, they can't look at this mess.  Well, I'm talking to you guys.  Hey, bye-bye.  Take it easy.  Crap.  Take it easy.  Yeah, that's got to hurt.  Keep shooting, he says.  Keep shooting.  Oh, it just blew up Namir. 
[01:29:00]  Wow.  Time now.  All right, we just engaged all eight individuals.  Wow.  A few of them are still firing.  Got him.  They're not intending on shooting unarmed people.  No, it's their job.  Goddammit, Kyle.  All right.  I hit him.  I hit him.  He's laughing.  I'm sorry.  I hit him.  This is what they do.  I know.  What do you expect?  What do you expect?  Dialogue out of a movie?  You can say war is hell every time they shoot?  Exactly.  We have on the phone? 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, and we'll get back to that.  We got Joanna Molloy from the Daily News on the line.  That's funny about war is hell.  Thank you.  War is hell.  We're actually really...  And he has to light up three cigarettes in his mouth.  Yeah, we're a funny radio show, so...  Really?  Yeah, really funny.  When did that happen?  Hey, we just read your article on air with this Jocelyn James.  We're not a big fan of hers whatsoever.  Is that right?  She's one of the few that doesn't want any money, supposedly. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  The issue...  She actually loved him.  No, she didn't.  Oh, my Lydia.  Come on.  Well...  Hold on, hold on.  You don't believe that, right?  So far, she has not asked for any dough.  Hmm.  Well, she's going to get a lot out of the fact that she was connected with Tiger, so technically  she's going to get a lot of dough out of this, right?  Well, you know, she is dancing at the Pink Pony down here in Georgia. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, but why...  Hold on.  Let me start with that.  So you know she's dancing at the Pink Pony, right?  Yeah.  You do realize that it's probably 150 miles from where they're playing golf, so it's  not even a...  It's a non-issue.  It's not a story.  Except that the club has thoughtfully given directions on their website from Augusta.  Well, that's wonderful, because they're trying to exploit the situation, but the fact is it  would take you a minimum of two to two and a half hours to get there from Augusta.  It's not even close to where he's playing golf. 
[01:31:00]  Seriously, some of the other ones are, you know, much worse.  You know what's my favorite, I think?  The one that went on the Today Show and decided to look classy, so she glued a rhinestone on  her cheek.  Oh, that's...  Jamie Junkers?  Yeah, Junkers.  She's my favorite, I think.  They're all bad.  Our favorite is the Perkins waitress.  I mean, hands down.  She was a big slob.  Take out the tampon.  I only have 15 minutes.  Yeah, yeah.  I actually respect that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's classy.  Don't you think, though, a couple of things that bother me. 
[01:31:30]  Don't you think it's kind of embarrassing?  It's like, all right, she had sex with a married guy, and it was...  I don't even fault her for that.  It's like, that's their business.  But don't you think it's kind of humiliating, the way she just can't keep her face out of  the page?  Don't you think it's a humiliating tap dance for attention?  It's embarrassing.  She's an embarrassment.  Yeah, and you say she doesn't want any money, hasn't asked for money, but, you know,  then why doesn't she just go away?  And why is Gloria Allred involved, if this is just a lover scorned? 
[01:32:00]  Yes.  If Gloria Allred is around, I think maybe later they'll be...  I think that there have been discussions about money, and he said no, because, you know,  he's got the shortest arms in the world.  Yeah, I heard that, too.  In three years that he was with her, she told me, he never gave her a present, he never  sent her flowers, I mean, and he did, like, everything imaginable to her.  Maybe he thought she was dead. 
[01:32:30]  You know, send her a gratitude posy.  I mean, something.  But don't you think, Joanne, it's like...  I think she had three birthdays.  Yeah, but why can't she figure it out that Tiger didn't like her in that way?  Yeah, she was a porn girl he was having sex with.  He just wanted to get off.  That's why he didn't give her any gifts.  He could care less about her.  He had a whole bunch of girls like her.  You know, I think that these girls are, like, raised to please men or something.  I mean, I think she really, really believed that when he flew her economy class to all 
[01:33:00]  of these tournaments, that he loved her.  I mean, that's what love looks like to a porn star, I think.  But it's almost like, by victimizing, even a subtle victimization like that, it's just  another way of justifying why everybody is in this guy's business.  I mean, I think the media has behaved embarrassing, because none of them are...  Don't think your pardon.  No, but think of it, nobody in the media is self-revealing.  Nobody. 
[01:33:30]  It's this self-righteous, holier-than-thou attitude, and yet nobody in the media offers  anything personal about their own sexual life.  Whoa, that's my private life.  And yet they won't give Tiger Woods the same respect, or the same courtesy.  You know what?  Guess what?  My husband got me to take the flannel nightgown off the other night.  There you go.  Wow.  Did he?  There you go.  You're a goer.  I'm revealing.  But you know what I'm saying?  It's this trend in the media.  It's this holier-than-thou, just sit back and pontificate, and it's like there's nothing  honest about the people who are writing the stories, as far as what they're telling us 
[01:34:00]  about themselves.  You know what?  Does anybody really care, you know, like what Christiane Amanpour does in bed?  These are like, you know...  She makes a point.  Tigers are a tad sexier.  But the point is, whether people care or not, if the question was asked, it wouldn't be answered.  The answer given would be, well, that's nobody's business but my own, or the privacy angle would 
[01:34:30]  be taken.  And this stopped being a legitimate story, I think, after there was no drunk driving,  no domestic violence, and that was just morbid voyeurism.  Well, I think you have a point.  I just don't know, like, you know, who cares of, you know, who Anderson Cooper does.  Wait a minute.  I do.  Well, yeah.  I mean, I think a lot of people would care exactly who he is.  That would be quite the, ooh, looky there.  Yeah.  Wow, a chick.  Surprise.  But, you know, well, Tiger, you know, once you step up and start taking those endorsements 
[01:35:00]  and walking around, you know, saying, with a little halo on your head, you know, like,  I am the automaton, I am perfect, you know, I'm a superhero, I can drive this ball so far  that they had to extend the course at Augusta to accommodate me.  But that's, right, that's, to me, where the interest in him is.  He's a great golfer.  That's not why.  No, he's a great golfer, but he also sets himself up as this, you know, like, perfect guy. 
[01:35:30]  He's a public figure, and he takes all these endorsements, and he's like, look what I can do.  I'm a role model to kids.  I have this, he has this facility out in California, and he made everybody else feel bad because  he seemed so perfect, you know?  I know, I know, I know, I know, I know a lot about golf, and they didn't extend the course  because of Tiger. 
[01:36:00]  The guys have gotten better, but the equipment has gotten so good, they had to extend all the  courses around America.  Well, can he drive it further than just about anybody?  There's guys that hit it further than Tiger Woods in the PGA.  Okay.  But the fact that he's a public figure, and there's this perfect angle to Tiger, doesn't  that show you that, like, when you look at what's happened with Clinton, or even far back  as JFK or Martin Luther King Jr., the media was just different back then.  Everybody, or most of us, are dirty on some level.  Most of us have dirt. 
[01:36:30]  Even if it's in a monogamous relationship, that would be humiliating to have revealed.  And I'm not saying it should always be kept secret.  I'm simply talking about this detached, this tattletale attitude people have, and the media  is just embarrassing themselves, running around with microphones, talking to a porn girl,  going, look, do you feel like he loves you?  Well, we all know what it was.  There's just dishonesty in it.  Well, you have to admit that Tiger is a bit beyond the pale. 
[01:37:00]  I mean, we're up to 15.  In fact, I need flask cards.  But I seriously made flask cards, and I thought you guys would help me.  Look, the thing...  I can't keep them straight.  Like, do you know which one was on Tool Academy?  I don't know.  Jamie Grubbs.  Oh, is it Jamie Grubbs?  Yeah, I'm going to quiz you.  But he's like a guy who just had sex with a lot of powerful men.  He's had sex with a lot of people.  And any man...  The attitude of women is almost understandable, but it's the attitude of men that's driving 
[01:37:30]  me crazy.  I don't know how he could behave that way.  When every man understands how he could behave that way.  But have you done, like, at least 15 women in the past couple of years?  That's like a second job.  You don't know who you're talking to here.  Let me tell you.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  No, no.  I'm a comic, so I open up about things.  I've gotten a lot of prostitutes.  I've done a lot of very dirty things.  And I've certainly been making fun of Tiger. 
[01:38:00]  But I don't come from a self-righteous point of view.  I don't mind talking about my own stuff and making fun of his.  And I know that sounds like an odd point, but the media doesn't do that.  And it's like I'm sick and tired of this editorializing and moral pontificating when it's all fraudulent.  I don't think I pontificate.  I don't mean necessarily you.  But wait, are you married?  I'm not, no.  Big difference. 
[01:38:30]  It's a big, big difference, isn't it?  But I've opened up about the dishonest things I've done in relationships.  You're right.  There is a difference as far as my behavior and Tiger Woods' behavior, who I've deceived.  But as far as the public's business, it's like we value our own pride.  This is what I don't understand.  Why is nobody attacking this gotcha attitude everybody has?  Like literally, we value our own privacy, and yet this country can't get our goddamn faces out of this guy's living room.  We can't stop peeking through his curtains, and we feel entitled and justified to do it. 
[01:39:00]  It's a cultural thing.  We're like an embarrassing culture.  At this point, you know who has a word for this?  The Germans.  Uh-oh.  Do you know the word schadenfreude?  Schadenfreude?  Does it involve a coffee table and Danny Kaye?  Crystal lock.  The words are the only great things that the Germans have.  No, what does that mean?  It means the thrill of watching other people fail.  Yeah, okay.  And I think that there's a little bit of that, because this guy was too perfect. 
[01:39:30]  You said that before.  I like the fact that at least you're honest about it, because I think that's a huge part of it, is people are enjoying.  It's like, as the public, we like to adore people, but we love secretly to watch them swing by the neck, again, for things that most of us have done, or at least comprehend doing.  Why is there no honesty in that, though?  Why do people come from a moral point of view?  Why is nobody admitting that it feels good to watch somebody swing by the neck for things that our friends do? 
[01:40:00]  It's like when I said what he said.  We've all said a lot of dumb things.  Everybody says dumb things, and yet we crucify and vilify people who say it publicly.  Why is the media not attacking that angle, which is a much bigger issue?  Well, because the media is the force that built them up, partially.  We built people up, and they're like gods.  They're like the ancient Greek and Roman gods, right?  Yeah, but he's not a pedophile, Joanna.  If he was a pedophile or a rapist, I mean, I would really, really get it. 
[01:40:30]  I mean, if this guy...  I'm sorry, the tampon thing was gross.  Some of those texts were so gross.  But I do not want to see him in his little baseball cap.  I mean, I can't...  As a woman, I just cannot look at that guy anymore.  All right, hold on.  But when you were getting your period, did you ever have, like, period sex?  She has a sense of humor, though.  I do like her.  Jeez, man.  But I'm serious.  I mean, have you ever had period sex? 
[01:41:00]  Because, you know, you're horned up, and you're like, you know, it's my time here.  I'm doing my thing.  Have you ever gone down that road?  Not in a parking lot.  All right, you know what?  You know what?  It's either or.  My rule is either or.  Yeah.  You know what?  You know, we wanted to hate you, but...  Yeah, we really didn't want to hate you, but you are...  At least you have a sense of humor about it.  You're a good egg.  You are a good egg.  But I just wish that the attitude of the media was more on it.  And I know it's so easy and cliche to blast the media, but like you said, the media is 
[01:41:30]  the one that built him up.  And to me, where is the satisfaction?  And why does this tear him down and make him an awful...  Those texts were not that bad.  They were just dirty texts.  And how come nobody is pointing out how despicable this woman is for not printing her own text  responses?  She had an excuse for that.  What did she say, Joanna?  Well...  I forgot.  She had an excuse for that.  Said, I apologize that you can't read my text, but something with her service plan or something.  Oh, really? 
[01:42:00]  No, I'm serious.  I forgot exactly what she said, but she did have an excuse why.  Yeah, she has 15 whore minutes or more.  What does she have?  Terrible improv.  Yeah.  More importantly...  I think she'd better get the check from him.  Rachel, you could tell, I think really did get 10 million.  Wow.  What did she have on him?  You want to know why?  Because Gloria Allred is friends with the guy that owns TMZ, and he reported that, and  I think she would have told him the truth.  She was the first one that came out, and I think that Tiger thought he could keep it all 
[01:42:30]  quiet.  You know what?  We thought that at first, but Tiger, knowing there's so many other women out there, we  feel that she must have had something really good on him, whether it was a sex tape or  just something.  Because you can't think that Tiger's going to pay off this woman 10 million and everyone  else is going to keep quiet.  It doesn't make sense.  That goes to our next trivia question.  Who did he offer $200,000 to?  Not the Perkins waitress. 
[01:43:00]  No.  Okay.  That one was Ashley Sampson, and she took $25,000 from the Inquirer, and now she's pissed  because she could have got more from Tiger.  You don't think any of these women are actual victims, do you?  No, no.  It takes two to do it in the parking lot, you know?  Right.  Okay.  And did you actually see Bodacious Ta-Tas 9? 
[01:43:30]  Okay, I'll be honest.  The only porn movie I've ever seen is Bodacious Ta-Tas, and I saw it in college.  Oh, all right.  And my friends and I got it out, and these were the hugest boobs that you ever did see.  Oh, you never saw Club Soda Kenny.  You like big boobs, huh?  Well, that I've ever seen.  Dirty, dirty.  I'm sure you guys have done better.  And I don't even know if there is a 9, but if there is, I think one of these ladies would  star in it.  Well, 8 was nominated for editing, so 9 is possibly. 
[01:44:00]  All right.  Check it out.  Bodacious Ta-Tas 9.  As a member of the media, can you at least investigate, even if you don't write about  it, just this sickening trend in the culture, this absolute fraudulent outrage people have?  Can't people start addressing that?  Because, again, it is just, all we do is sit there and snitch on each other and encourage  tattling and not being honest about our own behavior.  We encourage people to be self-righteous, and it's just, I watch this, and it's like, 
[01:44:30]  how does anybody not just screaming about this?  Nobody talks about it.  And then you find out that the two anchors are doing each other and stuff like that.  Yeah, exactly.  But you know what I'm saying?  It's like, that's fine if they are, but at least just tell the truth, and they don't,  their attitude is not honest.  They're also out of shape.  That's what it is.  Nobody cares.  Yeah, that's true.  Nobody wants to see fat anchors naked.  All right, I've got my assignment.  I'm on it, boss. 
[01:45:00]  All right, and I enjoyed talking to you.  I didn't think I would, but at least you have a sense of humor.  While we have you on the phone, what gossip are you working on?  Anything good?  I am totally on a tiger beat right now.  Let's put it that way.  Yes.  I'll call you back on that.  Where do you hail from?  Oh, I'm on New York, New York, way back.  Yeah, not Long Island?  Well, yes, but in the flight to the suburbs, we had to do a stint out there. 
[01:45:30]  Why, are you hearing my accent?  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  Yeah.  A little, just a tad.  Just a smidge.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, my people got here in New York in the Spud's Famine.  The Spud's Famine, okay.  You know, the potato famine.  Nice Irish girl, sure.  And they got the $49 apartments in Chelsea, and they still have them.  Oh, my God.  That's a nice deal.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it was.  Yeah, so we've been in New York from the horses days. 
[01:46:00]  Wow.  All right.  All right.  That was nice talking to you.  Yeah, right on.  Hey, hey, hey.  All right, well, nice talking to you guys.  At least you were brave enough to come on our show.  Most of these people say no to us.  Well, as you may know, I chronicled Anthony's little thing.  Oh, right, that's true.  I forgot about that.  Yeah, yeah.  Anthony was a naughty boy, wasn't he?  The fun divorce, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  My favorite was the closet scene.  Oh, that one. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, that one.  I thought you meant the divorce.  Yeah, the closet was great.  Oh, my God.  Is there anything good for me now?  What are you doing now?  You should have seen the look on her face when that door opened up.  Wowie Kazowie.  Well, it's lucky she didn't have a golf club in her hands.  Yeah, true.  Although I got a lot more dangerous things than golf clubs at the house.  Anthony's been behaving just file trading with Gary Glitter.  You can print that.  That's a quote.  That's a quote.  Get out of here.  That's a quote. 
[01:47:00]  You ass.  All right, well, alert me if you get a new...  Yeah, if I have a new catastrophe, I'll let you know this summer.  I'm sure it's something...  You had like a fatal attraction thing going there.  Didn't weren't clothes burned in the barbecue or something?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the girl that was in the closet, her clothes got burned.  Yes.  Yeah, and some things got taken from my house and stuff.  Yeah, it was quite the summer whirlwind romance that we had going there.  Who knew traffic girls could be so emotional? 
[01:47:30]  Well, summer's coming up, Anthony.  Come on, I'm going to need material.  I know.  You can.  I'll grab up somebody unstable and hopefully...  I think the one with the rhinestone on her cheek is available.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'll try that.  Although I don't think I want Tiger's seconds.  No, you can't follow that.  Yeah.  Use a Jimmy cap.  Oh, listen to you.  Didn't you hear that he wasn't wearing condoms? 
[01:48:00]  Doesn't that...  Yeah.  No, listen, absolutely he was not.  And Jocelyn told me he never wants to use a condom.  And by the way, she got pregnant twice.  Oh, wow.  Did she get rid of...  Yeah, and they've all been now tested up the gazoo.  Literally.  That's part of the thing that's gross.  I mean, it's not a very good message.  Never, ever used a Jimmy cap, which is very interesting, you know, from his point of view.  Oh, they just feel horrible.  They really are awful. 
[01:48:30]  But again, that's part of being an addict.  That's addict behavior.  I don't recommend them at all for sensation.  I don't either.  And what I do to prevent diseases, I just keep whispering, it can't happen to me.  It can't happen to me.  Oh, that works.  Okay.  Okay.  All right, guys.  All right.  We'll let you go.  I've got to hit the course.  Bye, Joanna.  Thank you.  We'll let her up.  Take it to the boy from the Daily News.  Yes, there she goes.  See that?  You talk to somebody, you wind up...  That's the second time with Richard Huff from the news.  We were going to kill, and we talked to him, and he was great, and then she turned out 
[01:49:00]  to be nice.  She was all right.  She laughed at our dumb jokes.  But I mean, she wasn't...  At least she was like, yeah, all right, that's true.  She wasn't prudish.  She wasn't self-righteous.  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  That's good.  I like that.  Bob Kelly's here, so why don't we take a break, and we'll continue with Robert Kelly.  And now, Vaginal Self-Esteem by Jim Norton.  What's better than fucking it ass while that dumb tampon string dangles, showing the vagina  how replaceable it is?  What's better than when the fucking tamp string is hitting your bag?  And it's like the pussy going, God damn, am I easily replaceable. 
[01:49:30]  Do you realize I am the birthplace of life, and now that I'm not operational, the place  shit comes out is working just as well.  The vagina must have low self-esteem.

Look at this.  Bobby hasn't been on in a while.  I know.  He's been away in Los Angeles.  It's been a while since we've seen Bobby.  Bobby!  What are you doing in LA?  Where have you been?  Hi.  Hi, sweetie.  What's up? 
[01:50:30]  What are you doing in LA?  It's not you.  Why is it so high?  Bob is having trouble with the chair.  Fuck it.  I'll stand.  Dude, yes.  You know what?  I am an LA guy kind of now.  Why?  I don't know.  What happened?  I quit smoking.  I woke up every day.  Ran up a canyon.  You run up canyons?  What's the matter?  What's the matter?  What's the matter?  What's the matter? 
[01:51:00]  It's jizz fucking trees.  It's fucking jizz trees in New York.  Why?  He smells gum flowers.  It's fucking jizz trees in New York, you cunts.  You're a fucking jack in New York, Anthony.  Welcome home, Bobby.  Welcome home, Bobby.  I hate the fucking smell.  I think I was molested or something. 
[01:51:30]  Please take this off.  Yes!  All right, we put the new one on.  Holy shit.  Is that funny?  Yeah, it is funny.  Bobby, what is this all about?  Yeah, I don't understand what this is about.  What is this all about?  What are you talking about, cum trees in New York?  Dude, there's jizz trees in New York City.  What does that mean?  They do smell like cum.  You smell like fucking...  Smell that, dude.  Have you smelled them? 
[01:52:00]  I smell that.  Smell it, Bobby.  It smells like a fucking someone...  Like nine guys just danked on your cheek.  Like can't fucking take it.  The whole neighborhood.  It stinks.  It smells like fucking jizz all the time.  Oh, God.  It smells...  You know when you...  Ugh.  Look, I fucking smelled...  You know, you jerk off.  You get a little on your hand.  Yeah.  You get it on your cheek.  Talk into the mic.  It smells like it.  It does.  No, I smelled. 
[01:52:30]  It was okay.  I mean, it was strong, but it wasn't that bad.  You're not a magician.  I...  You fucking dickhead.  I seen him.  All right, Chris Sander.  Oops, sorry.  It's fucking terrible, dude.  I can't take it.  Yeah, you don't like that.  I don't like what?  Jizzy smell.  No.  No, I don't.  Do you?  I'm sorry.  No.  Am I stepping over a fucking Italian boundary?  Fucking disrespect my family.  Jizz is part of our lives.  Oh.  This is what your fucking face would smell like if Anthony jizzed on it. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  This is how much jizz comes out of his huge dick.  So what?  Because the trees are blossoming.  They smell like cum.  Oh, the fucking microphone smells like cum.  And the microphone smells like a cum.  Dude.  You know what?  We all took a whiff and...  Steve at the bar is a friend of mine.  He gave me my cum for free.  He gave me HIV.  He bombs with his jokes. 
[01:53:30]  He'll treat your cock like a smoke.  And stick it where food ought to be.  Bobby, we all took a whiff and it's a really, really bad smell.  Dude, I actually...  This fucking...  I was walking around all weekend smelling jizz.  And I'm just...  I'm like...  Wondering why the fuck am I smelling that?  I started getting mad at my wife. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, no.  I'm not kidding, dude.  I was walking around and I'm smelling it.  Do you smell it?  She's like, no.  And then I'm like, is this bitch...  Is this fuck...  Come here.  I was like, good old...  Let me smell your fucking face and chest and hands.  Like, are you fucking...  Did you do something?  How did you finally find out what it was?  Dude, I...  It had to be the fucking jizz trees.  These white trees in New York City.  I grabbed...  Fuck...  One of the leaves off it.  Well, it's not even leaves yet.  They're just blossoming.  So it's like the blossoming of the leaves is giving off this really bad smell. 
[01:54:30]  Do we know the actual name of the tree that you're calling the jizz tree?  Jizz tree.  I got a photo of it if you want to fucking give Danny some help.  We actually watched it on your YouTube...  Yeah, that's exactly...  I think...  I don't know.  Does...  Look, I know that it's pollen because I put the thing to my nose and it was like  it fucking jizzed all over my face because the pollen was all over my face.  I don't...  Does tree fuck...  Does tree fucking jizz smell like human jizz?  Can I ask you a question?  Yes, sir.  What smells worse? 
[01:55:00]  Can I do this?  What smells worse?  That or my belly button?  You smell it?  Take it off my belly button?  Dude, I don't have to...  You could fucking...  I showered this morning.  You could put this jizz on a dead guy's belly button and then shit on it.  And I would say you.  Take a whiff of Jimmy's belly button and tell us which is worse.  You know what it smells like?  There's actually nothing there.  Oh, bro.  I showered like an asshole.  I do shower.  Listen, fucking magician boy.  I know your tricks.  Fucking asshole.  Still trying to do the fucking... 
[01:55:30]  I showered.  Small ball, little ball trick to me.  I get it.  All right, fair enough.  Hang in there, Bobby.  Hang in there.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Come on, Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby, come on.  Hang in there.  And he's holding the jizz tree thing.  Come on, Bobby.  He's going to run his head. 
[01:56:00]  This fucking jizz thing is terrible.  You can't take jizz in massive amounts.  You don't sound like a fun guy.  I can't.  What'd you say?  You don't sound like a very fun guy.  Can we take jizz?  It's too much jizz, dude.  Can you take a full whiff of the jizz tree?  I just did.  It's fucking...  No, don't we have another bag of it somewhere?  Someone went out with...  It does smell like cum, dude.  I mean, it really does.  Yeah, you're a fucking man.  It's dirty, though.  It's dirty.  It smells a heck of a lot.  No, Bobby, we all smell this.  You fucking...  Why am I discovering this?  Hold on.  We're not happy with the smell, but you take it to a whole new level. 
[01:56:30]  It's a horrible smell, but it makes you fucking puke.  Why am I discovering this?  Why hasn't this been discovered?  It's fucking 2010.  We have iPads and shit.  The jizz tree should have been fucking discovered in like the 1800s.  It's the jizz tree.  Yeah, like every 48 years, the jizz tree comes back and fucking blossoms, and everybody smells  like fucking loads in Chelsea and Hell's Kitchen.  They're saying it's the flowering dogwood.  Someone else is saying it's the Bradford... 
[01:57:00]  I think that's how you say it, too.  Bradford pear?  There's probably a bunch of names, like Chicken Cacciatore is also fucking Hunter's Chicken.  You know what I mean?  There's a bunch of names.  Derek mentioned Dogwood.  Dogwood?  It does look like...  I mean, the flowers do look very similar.  It looks like it's the dogwood tree, and they're blooming, and it's giving off this horrendous  smell.  I don't know why I can't take this much load.  Oh, really?  You don't know why?  It brings you back to another time.  Snip that.  Yep.  It brings you back to when you were younger, and you were trying to do something innocent, 
[01:57:30]  and an older man was coming into his own hand and feeding it to you like a little...  like a zoo animal.  You're going to tell the story, be specific, in the closet.  You're going to throw the fucking grain out of the machine.  Exactly, yeah.  And he even knew not to curl his fingers in, so you wouldn't bite his fingers like a fucking  horse eating an apple.  Loud hand.  I think Jimmy's on to something there, Bobby.  I think so.  Yeah, well, we got you.  Oh, it actually came up. 
[01:58:00]  Sperm tree?  Spunk tree?  Yeah, well, according to the Urban Dictionary, there's a sperm tree, which is saying the same  thing.  It smells like sperm.  It's the ornamental pear tree.  So let me pop that into some...  Spunk tree?  Sperm tree?  Look at that shit.  You see?  People thought of this before.  You're on to something, Bobby.  Oh, that's it.  Yeah, that's it.  That's the fucking...  That's the ornamental pear tree.  The ornamental pear tree.  That's the jizz tree of fucking New York City right there.  That's the culprit.  That's why all gay guys are walking around singing and smiling every afternoon. 
[01:58:30]  Backing into trees.  That's why they all...  I love the spring.  Danny, so we figured out what the jizz tree is?  Yes.  Judging from the images and the Urban Dictionary, the jizz tree is indeed the ornamental pear  tree, everybody.  Ornamental pear tree.  A.K.A.  We got to the bottom of it, Bobby.  The jizz tree.  Mystery has been solved.  Oh, fuck.  You really have a hard time with that.  It definitely loses its fucking potency after you cut it off the tree. 
[01:59:00]  Or it dries up on your stomach.  Just like regular jizz.  Yeah.  Yeah, when you peel it off an hour later, it doesn't have the same potency.  It's not as good when you fruit roll up it off your belly and eat it.  Oh, shit.  It's not as good.  It tastes like grilled cheese.  It's not as good when you let the hot water hit it and it turns to fucking egg in the  shower.  Yeah.  Fucking rubber cement on your stomach hairs.  Hey, what are you doing?  I get really bad gas.  Do you?  Yeah, I get bad because I'm drinking the protein shakes. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, they kill you, right?  You're picking your ass now, though, after you farted.  Because my underwear was, like, fucked up and it was, like, caught in my asshole.  Oh, okay.  So I had to let it out.  That's a good one.  That's pretty good.  He's throwing it around now.  That's a pretty good one.  Danny?  I'm not getting any.  Nothing?  Nothing.  Go ahead, Rookie.  We deal with Jimmy's every day.  What do you got?  Jimmy's is...  You got nothing.  You got nothing.  After smelling Jim's last, what was that, Thursday?  That was...  It was...  Was it bad?  Oh, my God.  Worst ever from Jimmy in all the years I've known him.  Yeah.  Worst fart ever was last Thursday. 
[02:00:00]  My farts were putrid.  It's not like somebody was burning Al Sharpton.  This is exactly what...  And then in the parking garage before I left, as I was getting in the driver's side door...  He sucked your cock?  Yeah.  He sucked my cock.  It was fantastic.  I shut my door as I got in and looked over and his ass was in my passenger door farting.  And so I had to drive with that fucking smell in my car.  It was great.  I dropped a fucking nice gasser in his truck and closed the door and assed all...  It fucking hung me like a ghost.  Yeah.  It was terrible.  Dude, this is exactly what a fucking gay porn set smells like. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  The jizz tree.  Just the fucking...  That clean, kind of clean, dirty smell.  It smells exactly like the peep booths.  Yeah.  It's exactly like peep booths.  Just like old...  It's dirty.  Old jizz in the air.  I know.  Oh, there's old jizz in the air.  That smell makes you want to pick my chewing gum up off the floor.  Oh, God.  You're disgusting.  Do you ever step in somebody's jizz?  Dude, I fucking moonwalk through it in the fucking peep shows. 
[02:01:00]  Fucking give me a minute.  Oh, I don't care, man.  Fuck, peep booths don't bother me at all, man.  I haven't been in a while.  You laugh at peep booths?  I do.  I really do.  I'd fucking take flip-flops in on a peep booth.  I don't give a fuck.  I've never been in a peep booth.  Wow.  I've never been in one...  Like, I've been in one of the booths that play, like, the movies.  Yeah, that's what I've been to.  I've never seen, like, live.  Yeah, I've never been, like, a live girl peep booth.  I'm talking about the movie booths.  Oh, a peep shows.  Okay, I've been in those. 
[02:01:30]  No, we were in with my brother.  Were the girls in the middle?  You told me about that.  I wasn't in there.  Yeah, back in the day.  That was way back in the day.  You were in?  Looking across?  Yeah.  Yeah, we all had our own window, and we were looking across at each other.  That was the old school, man, when it was, like, a genie's bottle, and they had the  chicks inside of it.  Oh, she was awful, right?  And my brother grabbed...  Who was licking her box?  Not one of us.  There was somebody licking box, like, uh...  Who the fuck would do that?  Dude, I licked asshole for $3.  You would lick a box out of the...  Wow.  I licked a Filipino's asshole for $3. 
[02:02:00]  You're crazy.  Dude, no.  It was pretty good.  He was named Phil Appino.  Yeah, he was an Italian guy.  He was an old boxer.  Big fucking hairy...  Bob thought he said Phil Esposito, and he'd have a great ranger story.  No, I remember...  I remember one girl, because they could climb over the thing to get...  Hey, Bobby, come here.  Hey.  You're back again.  Lick my fucking ass.  Dude, go ahead.  Put the ones away.  I don't fucking...  We're friends.  Guy, lick that ass.  I remember the girl could escape by climbing out of the octagon.  It was kind of like an octagon, and everyone had their own little area with a tiny little 
[02:02:30]  square window.  You could stick your head through it.  And my brother grabbed his hand...  Reached his arm through and grabbed the woman's leg.  She was not happy with that.  No.  It was a great one on 54th.  Me and Voss used to go to it.  It was on 54th, right off of Broadway.  You'd do Carolines and go...  It makes it sound like going to a Broadway show.  Well, it was better than that.  Me and Voss just goes fabulous.  Fine.  You see cats.  I'll eat a girl's ass.  I literally did.  Five bucks I didn't ask for.  It was...  And then Giuliani came in, and that's where a lot of that stopped. 
[02:03:00]  It was when Dinkins was mayor.  It was great.  But when Giuliani came in, all that closed out.  The old Laugh Factory used to be one of the best ones, because it had...  Downstairs, it had all the booths and the movies.  Upstairs, it had two different types of windows.  The ones with the glass with the phone, which you would take out a dildo and...  Prison visit.  Rub it out for you.  Prison visit.  It was a real good one.  The thing was up the whole time, though.  It was a little more expensive.  Then they had the windows.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  You had to pick up the phone, though?  Yeah, you had to put that...  Smell someone else's bad breath?  That's like a theme of the show today. 
[02:03:30]  That'd be the jizz fucking phone.  You had to pick up the jizz phone and talk to the jizz lady?  Yeah, you had to talk to her, yeah.  Before you licked her asshole, you fucking sick fuck.  Dude, I fucking licked her ass.  I ate her asshole.  I stuck it in.  Like, I hardened my tongue.  But why would you do that?  You know what I mean?  I made my tongue into a little baby dick.  Why would you do that, Bobby?  And you don't care about the diseases or anything?  That makes me fucking paranoid as well.  Put diseases aside.  That's just fucking chick.  Diseases aside. 
[02:04:00]  No, no, I'm saying...  What disease can you get from a girl's asshole?  I don't fucking want to know.  You can't get hepatitis from a girl's asshole.  It's like she's not clean.  Yeah, she is.  She had baby wipes.  No, stop it.  She baby wiped her ass in between licks?  There's a box of baby wipes in the middle of the fucking room, and that's all they do is...  Did you force a baby wipe before you got in there?  No, she's...  She's...  No, they fucking...  Oh, you want it to smell like a mushroom.  I understand.  Yeah.  But yeah, she's working all day.  She's probably a pig trying to get truffles. 
[02:04:30]  Other guys trying to get truffles.  Other guys fucking licking her ass.  Baby wipe takes that right out.  Oh, does it?  Yeah, it takes it right out.  Yeah.  It takes that fucking rotten tooth smell out from that guy, that English teacher that was in before you.  Oh, bleh, let me lick your ass.  Bring your ass over here.  Yeah.  He's got one of Mike Schmidt's mustache hairs in her asshole.  I used to...  Oh, man.  Those are the best ones, though.  You can stick your fucking head in and touch. 
[02:05:00]  Those are the best.  I remember when we first got here.  Me, Burr, Patrice, Dane, and three other guys all came to New York, went to one of those,  and we all got in the booth at the same time, and it just...  Our heads popped out.  So it was just our heads.  Like, dude, what's up?  What's up?  Just looking at each other.  There should have been a guillotine above it.  How much better comedy would be.  But that's what we did.  That's what we did, man.  We all had our heads popping out into the octagon as she was trying to, like, dance sexy, and we were just fucking around with her.  Patrice ran out of cash, so he fucking popped into mine. 
[02:05:30]  He was like, yo, Bobby, Bobby.  Yo, tell her to come over here.  He had me head, like, this fucking girl walk up.  Honing in on your action.  It was my head, like, hey, excuse me, can you hear me?  And just his eyes in the background of those little rooms.  Looked like the opening from Scooby-Doo.  Bob's farting.  Yeah.  What do you want me to do, rookie?  Get out of the way.  Bob's, like, farting right on Jim.  Let me say hi to an Anthony in Jersey.  Anthony.  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[02:06:00]  I went to one of those peep boots, and we were drunk at the time.  The girl wanted more money, and I was flat out of cash.  And she's like, come on, more money, more money.  I'm like, ah, fuck you, you skank.  She goes, what did you call me?  Good one.  Next thing I know, she turns around.  She's got a lighter and a bottle of hairspray.  And she goes, I will light you on fire.  Oh, that's good.  And what did you say, faggot?  Yeah.  I waited until the door shut.  Then I ran out of her and was cursing her out. 
[02:06:30]  And then the Indian gentleman from around the booth came out and threw us out.  Wow.  That's an incredible story.  Yeah, what would it be better if she fucking...  Sex, danger, and had everything.  Yes, an Indian man.  What story is it made better by an Indian man doing something?  Every story needs an Indian man, as far as I'm concerned.  We should add one.  Hold on.  You know, Leo's right here.  Leo in Cleveland.  You're going to be in Cleveland soon, right?  Improv in Cleveland, Thursday, April 22nd through the 24th.  Robert Kelly.  Look what I do right there.  Now, Leo, what do you got?  Seamless.  Bobby, you can put your tongue on a dirty Filipino's asshole, but you almost puke when you smell 
[02:07:00]  a pear tree.  No, it's a fucking jizz tree.  And it smells like jizz.  He makes a point, because it's not actually jizz, but you can lick a fucking Filipino's  asshole.  Yeah, it smells like a fucking dirty Filipino's asshole.  Yeah, it didn't smell, though.  Asshole doesn't smell.  Yes, it does sometimes.  Sometimes.  Come on.  I don't mind it.  It doesn't smell.  I want to know it's an asshole.  Can we rub this all over your body?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  All right, what would happen?  I don't want to smell like jizz.  I'm going to the fucking 48th Street gym. 
[02:07:30]  It's all fucking gay guys.  Oh, God damn.  Just walk in and be attacked.  You'll smell like jizz afterwards.  I'll be catnip.  Yeah, exactly.  I was going to say, man.  Walking like potpourri.  I'll be attacked and dragged into a sauna.  They're all going to be clawing Bob's back, trying to climb up him.  Like fucking vampires.  Let's say hi to Steve C.  Steve C?  Uh-oh.  Yes, it's the most wonderful time of the year.  The trees are booming. 
[02:08:00]  The pine trees is blooming.  It's fun to be queer.  It's the most wonderful time of the year.  Wow, thank you, Steve.  That was awesome.  I love it.  I sent Steve call in every so often.  I like when Steve calls in.  Good evening.  That song was so good.  I like it.  It's catchy.  Let's say hi to Jimmy James in New Hampshire.  Jimmy James.  Morning, boys.  Just wondering if you wanted a horrific walking through jizz story.  Sure.  Why not?  All right.  Well, I inspect fire sprinkler systems for a living. 
[02:08:30]  And I was up at a fraternity house at a prestigious college in New Hampshire.  And I happened to be inspecting the rooms.  Found a garden tool closet with the back cut out.  And so I wandered in through.  And I walk into this probably six-by-four room.  All that's in it is a little table with a TV-DVD combo, a pile of pornos, used toilet paper,  stacked about knee-deep, so it was like wading through a bog of jizz. 
[02:09:00]  And the TV screen on this thing basically looked like somebody had a lit candle and was just shaking it at the TV for hours on end.  It was the worst experience of my life and apparently not as good a story as I thought.  Another fascinating story.  All right, brother.  Thank you.  It wasn't that bad a story.  Let me say hi to Anthony in Mount Sinai.  Bobby, dude, how many licks does it take to get to the center of a Filipina's asshole? 
[02:09:30]  A one, two, or three?  And then he bites the roid.  Three.  There you go.  That's funny.  It's a nice mouthful of blood.  Like a piece of freshen up.  Blood and a varicose vein is in between my teeth like dental floss.  You ever chew a roid?  No.  It's terrible for bubble blowing.  Blubble blowing.  Yeah, it's for blubble blowing.  It's kind of like bubble blowing, but it's not funny.  I don't like the video.  I mean, the video ones are real frustrating because you've got to put the money in and then just sit there and hit up, down, up, up, up, down, A, B, C, D, and just keep rolling through. 
[02:10:00]  There's computers now.  Why do you fucking got to go to a booth and watch a movie?  There's something fun about it.  There's something dirtier about it, dude.  Yeah, you're sneaking in.  Not even sneaking.  Just walking right in, right to the back.  Yeah.  Yeah, looking for shiny stuff on the floor, on the seat.  Do I stand up?  Do I try to sit down?  Do I kneel?  Do I lay in the fetal position and leap?  Do I tap the walls and hope a little hole falls out? 
[02:10:30]  Like Dr. Jekyll's restaurant?  What is this?  Bobby, do one more before we go to break.  What is that?  That's the jizz tree in the bag.  In the bag.  This one, the white bag.  It's desensitized.  Yeah, Bob is...  Oh, really?  No, no, no.  Let's do one more.  Your receptors get deadened.  They do.  That's filled with more jizz tree stuff.  Is that true?  Yeah, they do.  So if you just smell cum all the time?  If you're just smelling something all the time, then you stop smelling it because your  receptors get used to it. 
[02:11:00]  They're used to it.  One more time, Bobby.  Put your head right in there and smell the jizz tree.  I don't like...  Hang on one second.  I don't like the tricks that you fucking assholes are trying to pull on me.  Trixie Hobbit.  Yeah, you use receptors.  What do you fuck?  They do.  Both of you and you fucking tricks.  People work in the store.  I shot...  People work in the store and they actually...  Down at the sewer.  I know that it's going to smell like jizz, you dickwads.  I'm going to do it.  You don't have to trick me.  One more time.  Hang on one second.  Give it a good one.  Give it a good whiff.  I'm going to have it on like a feed bag.  Yeah.  Good whiff. 
[02:11:30]  Go, Bobby.  Smell the jizz tree one more time.  See?  You haven't gotten used to it.  No, I think it's died.  Yeah?  It's not as bad.  It smells a little...  You're used to it.  Your jizz tree, it's dying.  I don't think I can have it.  You've got to take it out, dude.  All he did...  Yeah, Bob's got a little tent in his pants now.  I'm getting a little carried away.  I'm starting to eat it.  Yeah, you really are.  I'm just starting to eat it and rub it on my ass off.  I'm just wearing it in his hair like Jenny Gump.  You know what you've got to do?  I want to rub it on every cup of my own.  You've got to...  Rub it in your hands like rosin.  Crush it up like Jim Cook. 
[02:12:00]  Like rosin.  No, rub it in your hands like rosin.  Like Jim Cook does with hops.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know how he takes the hops and then smells them?  Rub it in your hands.  I think I'm used to it.  He's used to it.  I think I'm used to it.  Yeah.  I think I'm used to it.  Yeah, we helped you.  You helped me what?  Become a fucking faggot?  Now everybody let's bukkake Jimmy.  You let me become...  Why me?  All right.  Why am I then?  My fantasy just came out.  Sorry.  Why is he the lucky boy?  Yeah.  Not my birthday.  Why does he get all the fuck...  What do you think I brought this up for, asshole?  I had a plan in mind. 
[02:12:30]  I mean, he just ruined it.  How funny was it when Forrest got married and Jenny had the flowers in her hair?  And then two weeks later, he was talking to her under a tree.  Like a fucking shepherd.  He buries her in the yard.  Instead of springing for a fucking...  Instead of springing for a nice grave.  Ah, Jenny.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Forrest is so strange.  She's such a fucking...  What an asshole.  Fucked him his whole fucking retard life.  Yeah.  And then right when he got Apple stock, she came back in and slipped it and died with AIDS.  He sits on his dick with AIDS. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  What a trooper.  That's good.  Fucking bitch.  And take this little mongoloid with you.  Yeah.  This fucking twat.  I hated her.  Here's something to take care of forever.  Fucking cunt.  Exactly.  No more fucking...  No John Baez songs for me.  I get the fucking hibs, silly.  Yeah.  You and your fucking no-leg lieutenant friend and his fucking war bride.  I enjoyed my life to the fullest.  Now I'm going to pull the cord, die, and take this shit dick with you.  Exactly.  So take your giant, delicious retard cock and keep running, broke legs. 
[02:13:30]  See the fucking giant, delicious comes in two seconds cock.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, he couldn't hold it in.  Of course he touched his dick and he...  That ruined your roommate's robe.  That's because he was looking at her roommate.  Let's go to Jennifer in Chicago.  Big Bobby Kelly fan.  Jenny.  What's up, Jennifer?  Hi.  Hi, Bobby.  Hi, Mama.  Hi, how are you?  Good, sweetie.  Oh, my God.  What the hell is this?  What the hell?  Are you smoking a pack a day, honey?  No, I'm fighting a little bit of a cold. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, really?  Are you?  It's the spring and you got a cold.  That's fucking odd.  Go ahead.  I'm a big fan of Bobby Kelly.  Yes, I want to be both deep into my episode of Boy's Life.  Yes!  Could you repeat that?  We didn't hear it.  I don't know what that was.  He sounded, at the beginning of that call, he sounded like the older version of the mom  from Back to the Future.  That was an incredible song in this.  That's funny.  She really did just did an old person voice. 
[02:14:30]  There was no acting.  Nothing.  All right, why don't we take a break?  So, Bobby, what are you promoting?  Des Moines.  Yeah.  Wow.  West Des Moines?  I don't know where the fuck I am, dude.  Funny Bone in West Des Moines, Iowa.  Yeah.  Somebody wants to go there and get married, doesn't they?  Yeah.  I'm going to Cleveland.  I do.  And then the big show that I have is Boston coming up in July, the Wilbur.  I got one show that I want to fill out.  All right.  That's cool.  When is that?  When is that?  It's in July.  In July.  Go to my website, robertkellylive.com, and my dates are up there. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, let's do that.  My Twitter, my Facebook, everything.  Dude, you killed in Atlantic City.  I know we'll get back to beating you up, but.  That was a fun show.  That was a great show.  You and Patrice, man.  Wow.  That was a good show.  Solid show.  I was fucking losing my mind, because that's the week I quit smoking cigarettes, too.  Oh, no.  You wanted to fucking strangle somebody.  Are you smoking?  No, I'm done.  It's been a month and two weeks.  Fucking good.  Not as bad?  No, now it's great.  Because you met me for a little dinner, or stopped by to say hi, and he was insane.  He looked like he was going to kill somebody.  Because I fucked up.  I quit smoking, and the first week I'm in Atlantic City, and then the next week I'm in 
[02:15:30]  Vegas.  And when you smoke, those are places you smoke.  Yep.  You sit, and you have a butt, and you fucking block, and I was sitting there just fucking  shitting.  And the smoke was in the air everywhere.  I felt like I wanted to smoke.  There was so much smoke going on.  You were smoking if you go in those places.  Yeah, basically, yeah.  Jesus Christ, those Asians light up every two fucking seconds.  Hey, hit me!  Hit me!  I'm gonna, you fuck!  I also realize that your wife's a sick fuck. 
[02:16:00]  Because you're trying to quit smoking, and she's right next to her smoking.  She's done now, too.  Yeah, but you should have quit at the same time is what I'm getting at.  She had a date.  She did the whole fucking red about it.  This is what you're supposed to do.  She picked a date, and I'm quitting Monday.  I just woke up one day and said, fuck it.  Yeah.  And just quit.  And just stopped, and got a couple pieces of gum, and started chewing it, and that was  it.  And then...  Chew it for fucking 15 years like Voss.  No, not that.  I fucking did that for a couple days and stopped, because I didn't want to fucking be addicted 
[02:16:30]  to it.  So you're on no patch, nothing?  Nothing.  I'm done.  And the urge isn't bad?  No, I don't have an urge.  Talk to your friend Voss.  How many years has he been chewing the gum at this point?  Oh, he's just awful.  We lost track.  It's gotta be three, four years.  That gum's terrible, too.  He just can't stop fucking chewing that gum.  It's bad, dude.  Fuck that.  I don't want to be addicted to that shit.  He tries talking with it in his mouth, and just fly him out.  Yeah.  Plus, it's expensive.  The fucking gum's really expensive to buy that shit all the time.  Why didn't you just buy regular gum?  Because now it's just a gum habit.  That's what I did. 
[02:17:00]  I switched it over to regular...  I just had regular gum that looked like that, and I just started chewing that instead  of the fucking stuff.  But...  Dude, I can...  This is weird.  You can smell...  This is probably why the jizz tree is fucking with me, because I can be in the elevator  now and smell somebody's rotten tooth.  Like halitosis.  The smell's gotten very good.  That's the worst smell ever.  It's like metallic-y.  It's disgusting.  I was on a plane coming back from L.A. a few weeks ago, and the guy next to me, his  breath was rancid, and he was in the seat next to me, and I could smell his fetid breath. 
[02:17:30]  I wanted to fucking elbow him in the mouth.  When I used to work with the retards, my boss, her mother worked on Saturdays and Sundays  in the morning, downstairs, and her teeth were fucking, like, props.  They were just jagged fucking props.  They just came in at 19 different directions.  They were brown, wooden fucking teeth.  Oh, shit.  Looked like frosted mini-weets.  And she, her, you would, they would, all around the house would be spray and napkins 
[02:18:00]  near every phone, because she would use the phone, and the fucking stank.  Wow, and everybody had to, like, spray and fucking-  I would throw up.  You know me.  I'd puke.  I'd go to answer the phone, hey, fucking puke.  What would you do if she had, like, just sucked on your nose for a minute, her breath  dried on your nose?  Dude, I'm just-  Look, dude, I'm glad she was only, like, fucking 4'2", so I didn't have to be, like,  when she talked to me, fucking disgusting teeth. 
[02:18:30]  Did she know her breath was terrible?  No.  She have to.  Well, you know what?  I had fucked up teeth.  The plaque.  You know the plaque?  When I smoke and drank, and I didn't have dental, like, around 10 years ago, dude, I got  fucking halitosis.  Somebody told me about it, like, dude, your breath stinks.  And I went to the dentist, and it was plaque.  When you smoke and drink, plaque, the white shit, that's the shit that stinks.  It's, I don't know what the fuck it is.  It's bacteria, but it forms into, like, a tooth.  I was flossing, I went to floss, and it fucking a piece of, it looked like a chunk of tooth 
[02:19:00]  came out.  It was plaque.  Jesus Christ.  So now-  You ever smell your dental floss?  Ugh.  I go to the dentist.  Why do you do that, Jimmy?  Why wouldn't you?  Four times a, four, every four months I go to the dentist now for a cleaning.  Yeah, I don't fuck around anymore.  Yeah.  Now that I have dental.  Achoo.  I went many years without a tooth.  Look at that shit.  I don't fuck around.  Yeah, you got some more, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Placke is the worst.  You ever smell your own breath on a coffee cup in the morning?  Not a coffee cup, on a water bottle in the morning, because it's- 
[02:19:30]  Sometimes it's like, what the fuck?  I brushed and did everything, but-  Are you drinking coffee?  That's never a good thing.  I used to date a girl, a breath smelled like mustard all the time.  I fucking hate it.  I love mustard on a sandwich, but not on a fucking-  But not on breath.  You wake up, it just smells like deli mustard.  I don't teach you to fuck girls who work at the carnival.  She worked at Nathan's stand.  You know, when you was a little boy, you used to love that flower rubbed on your chest.  Ah, fuck. 
[02:20:00]  I'd tickle your nose with it.  You know what?  If your mouth smelled like pussy, you would think it was bad breath, but then if you go  down on a girl, you don't care at all.  You love it.  Pussies are fucking trocious.  Some pussy-  What's wrong with you?  Well, some is, but-  It doesn't smell good.  It doesn't fucking smell good.  There's no-  You get over the smell, and you get used to the smell because it's pussy, and you have  to go down there and man up.  No, no, no.  It gets you all fucking, like, worked up.  Yeah.  It gets turned on.  It's not a fucking aphrodisiac, man. 
[02:20:30]  It's not fucking dog juice.  Really?  I love it.  Most pussy smells like a homeless guy's burping in your face.  Yeah.  It's fucking terrible.  You ever open two pussy lips and just take a lick?  Yeah, you get a lick.  You have to-  Homeless guy without teeth, right?  You have to lick the stink off it sometimes.  I don't mind that.  I'll actually just smell it.  I'll actually have a pussy on my face.  And again, not, like, a really filthy pussy, but a little dirty pussy, like, after a good  sweaty.  I'll just sniff it and smell the-  I'm not even kidding.  Smell it and smell the ass while I get my dicks out.  Do you ever open up a pussy and it sounds like you're opening up like a grilled cheese 
[02:21:00]  sandwich?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  That's awful.  That's when there's a yeast infection.  It's all the white stuff, right?  Yeah, she looks like-  She has manic depressive mouth in her pussy.  It's like, what are you eating?  Fucking-  Are you eating Haldol?  She's got fucking-  Yeah, she's got the white stuff in the corner of her pussy.  Yeah, it's sickening.  What are you, bipolar?  You fucking-  Just run a fucking marathon without any water?  What's worse than someone on fucking meds to fucking spill in the corner of their mouth? 
[02:21:30]  It's like you want to wipe it off and make them smell it.  Clean your mouth.  Put it in handshake.  Who farted now?  Oh, no.  No, he's showing us horrible pictures.  Not that it matters, but a lot of dentists are pissed off.  It's tartar, not plaque that you're talking about.  Oh, dentists listen to the show?  I'm surprised myself.  No shit.  Oh, wait.  Hang on a second.  What is it?  What are they saying?  It's fucking Zell calling in.  It's tartar.  Tartar.  Tartar built up.  Well, plaque.  What is plaque, then?  Well, let's-  I mean, fucking-  We're talking about pussies, but all right.  Anthony, Mount Sinai, you're a dentist? 
[02:22:00]  Yes, I am, gentlemen.  All right.  Let's go.  All right.  You ready?  Anthony, when you have the dirty plaque that Bobby's not cleaning off his teeth-  No, I wasn't.  I am now, you fucking jacked ass-  Listen, doctor.  Doctor.  Sorry, doctor.  I was listening, Bobby.  Ooh.  Don't get a tone.  Before when you were a dirty bird and weren't cleaning it off, what happens is the ions  in your saliva cause the plaque to harden and become what's called calculus, or the layman's  turn is tartar. 
[02:22:30]  Gotcha.  What is plaque?  Placke is the bacteria that form, that are eating the food that you're not cleaning off  your teeth properly.  What is, uh, so what is a big causer of, uh, tartar?  Causer?  Yes, a big causer of tartar.  A big causer of tartar?  Besides drinking when pregnant.  Yeah.  What causer weight would you take to get here?  Calculus.  Wow.  Yeah, it's a big hunk of tartar.  It's like, it's like, uh, chipping barnacles off the boat. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  Are you, like, if you, if you pulled a big thick piece of tartar off someone's teeth and  you, and somebody held it in their hands, would you be able to smell it?  Yeah, you could probably smell it.  It doesn't smell that bad.  The plaque is worse, but the tartar's pretty disgusting.  A lot of you guys end up killing yourselves, right?  There's a high suicide, no, I'm serious, there's a high suicide rate among dentists,  and I think it's because they can't deal with the smells after a while.  Now, that's kind of an old wives' tale. 
[02:23:30]  We're number two behind, uh, policemen, actually.  Well, that's not an old wives' tale, then.  A lot of you fuckers are killing themselves.  Yeah, cops, at least, you know, they drink and they're constantly stressed.  What is it with dentists?  Thank you for calling us a bunch of fuckers now, Ope.  What is it with dentists?  I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry.  Oh, I'm teasing, it's fine, I love you guys, I've been listening forever.  Now I feel bad about myself.  It's because no one likes the dentist.  They don't feel liked.  I'm driving to work right now in a car, I might just crash it into a fucking telephone pole.  Atta boy. 
[02:24:00]  Did you ever finger fuck a girl that was out there on nitrous?  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  No nitrous in the office.  Did you ever think about it?  Nope.  Yeah, you thought about it.  Yeah, it's not.  I hear you guys talk about it all the time, and it's just, it is creepy.  That happens a lot in Jersey, I don't know why.  It's Jersey.  All right, Anthony, the dentist, thank you.  Later.  All right, there he goes.  Want a break?  That was kind of interesting.  Robert Kelly, live.com for all his tour dates.  Yeah. 
[02:24:30]  Thanks, man.  Hey, I had some plaque on my teeth, it's because I won an award, they put plaques on it.  Oh, shit.  Who is this?  Chip, you don't want to know.  Who is that?  Chip.  Chip.

[02:27:00]  Jimmy was in Chicago recently at the Sears Tower.  I didn't know you could do that up there.  I did it in Toronto.  Basically, you go to the top and then they have like a glass floor.  Yes.  And then you walk in the middle of the glass floor and you're convinced you're going to fall right fucking through.  It's a glass box that's like stuck to the side of the building.  And the glass is so thick that obviously you're not going to fall through, but your mind just fucks with you. 
[02:27:30]  And you're like, holy shit, how am I not falling to my death right now?  And Jimmy's got a really good picture.  You had to have tweeted that one.  The top of the Sears Tower now has these three or four things sticking out.  It's got to be over 1,000 feet in the air.  And they're little glass boxes.  They go out about three feet.  And you can step out like you're at the end of the building inside.  And then you step out onto glass and in a glass box.  And it's probably the scariest thing I've ever done. 
[02:28:00]  I almost couldn't do it.  I was actually standing along the window and the box was jutting out and I could not get myself to go in.  I just couldn't do it.  Holy shit.  I'm terrible out of heights.  That's what your mind does to you because it's the safest thing you can do.  They should make a box that goes 100 yards out.  They should.  But only two feet off the ground.  That would be crazy.  I'm going to Twitter this picture of me sitting on the glass.  It was fucking horrifying.  Would you run full speed into the glass wall? 
[02:28:30]  No, because they told you that it's guaranteed nothing will happen.  I guarantee nothing would happen.  Would you be able to get yourself together to do that?  I can imagine running and then you fucking just jump and take a leaping karate both feet into the fucking outer walls.  And all of a sudden you realize they were wrong and you're and you feel cold air.  That's even better than the one they got in Toronto because it's a glass box like that.  You walk out over the fucking nothing.  Like this was like half the studio floor was glass and you couldn't wait to get to the other side. 
[02:29:00]  You're like, fuck that.  Creepy.  They have that at the Palms in Vegas.  They have that?  The ghost bar on the top floor.  Yeah.  There's a square that's just glass and you're out there hanging out and it's on the top floor of the Palms and you walk and you look down and you're literally looking straight down to the fucking parking lot.  That's so weird.  I can't do it.  I'm afraid.  I'm so afraid of heights.  And of course they got one at the Grand Canyon.  I would love to check that out.  That was high.  I can't even go on my balcony in hotel rooms if it's too high.  Really?  Like I can't.  Yeah.  Can't even fucking walk outside.  You should do that.  You could do it, dude. 
[02:29:30]  I was terrified of heights.  Terrified of heights.  Yeah.  But I get real bad fucking nightmares too, though.  Nightmares?  Yeah.  I get nightmares about that and tsunamis.  Like fucking.  Tsunamis?  Yeah.  Like 200 foot waves.  Coming right at you.  Like I'm on the top floor of a huge hotel and the waves are coming in 100 feet and they're just hitting the bottom of my balcony.  Yeah.  And then that big one comes in where it's just silent.  And the water comes off.  Oh, fuck yeah. 
[02:30:00]  And it's all cum.  Fuck.  It's all cum.  It's a cum wave.  Yes.  Everybody's drinking up your share.  I hear you.  I've had the same nightmare.  Hey, Jimmy's got that audio from yesterday we were discussing?  I just had my computer up, yeah.  Just to explain to Bobby, we were up in Rochester for a comedy thing.  Well, I went just to kind of support and see some old friends, whatever.  And Jimmy had great shows.  And the last show of his run, there was a problem in the front row.  There was a guy being a little. 
[02:30:30]  There was a problem.  A little disturbed.  Disturbing.  Really?  And I addressed him the whole show.  And this is, I did a 53-minute set.  This is 47 minutes into it.  That never happens to you, though.  It very rarely happens to you.  Well, he was not, yeah, he was, well, I was wondering why, because usually he should have  been thrown, not thrown out, because he was just being annoying.  And we found out he was the owner's son.  We found this out.  And the way Ken, yeah.  Exactly.  He did call yesterday and apologize on the air, because he was just fucking tight.  He knew he was raw.  But this is the audio of Kenny telling me.  And I'm going to stop it right after that, because after that. 
[02:31:00]  Can I just say something real quick?  Sure.  This is what bugs me about club owners, and any time you do a gig for somebody, they  give, instead of fans, people who paid fucking money, worked their ass off at Best Buy all  week to get to your show, they give their VIPs or whatever, who don't even give a fuck,  sit right up front, and the bachelor parties, and the people that got fucking, won a ticket  up front, and they sit all the people that paid to see you in the fucking back.  That's bullshit.  Fuck you.  All those people should be putting the back in a booth. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, it was only one guy, but it was, it was annoying, and I had been dealing with  him the whole show, and he was, he fucking, he was just, he was trying to eyeball the  comedians, whatever, he was just drunk.  And so I addressed it, but Kenny told me he was the owner's son, but this is how Kenny  told me, and I think this is right where it is.  I'm going to play this from my laptop, so I don't know how well it's going to sound.  I luckily re-tape every show, luckily, like we've captured this.  Wow, dude, I feel like this had to be able to whisper it. 
[02:32:00]  That's a woman's shirt.  That's like passing the rest of woman's shit.  Hey, Jim.  What?  That's the club owner's son who's ruining the show.  Yeah!  Dude, I had to stop because the guy's name is going to come out after it's not important,  but that's how, how fucking, how booming is Kenny's voice?  It's like God talking to you.  Hey, Jim.  What a giant dolt. 
[02:32:30]  He really is.  He should have been really fucking throwing a little girl into the lake with fucking bolts  in his neck.  What did, what did you do to the guy?  What did the guy want to believe in?  No, he stayed the whole show.  That was 47 minutes into it, but I, I had scolded him numerous times.  What was he doing?  It was really weird.  Like, he was, uh, like, uh, I, he was just trying to eyeball me like, like that.  So I, I addressed it probably a minute into the show.  Why was he eyeballing you?  I, I, I, now looking back on it, he was just drunk.  He was very, very drunk. 
[02:33:00]  He was probably trying to stay focused.  Yeah, I don't know what he was doing.  You know what?  He might've been.  Probably trying to just stay focused and listen and not fucking talk.  But he was, he was like mumbling smart ass remarks.  Um, nothing terrible, but like, if I would say like, you know, it's really funny when  somebody go, no, it's not that type of stuff that fucks your rhythm up.  It was, it was making me so angry.  And, uh, but it was, but a part of me was enjoying having somebody to kill.  Like it was fun to have somebody to fucking, yeah.  But after you feel like you feel like what the fuck, right? 
[02:33:30]  Well, I was very angry about it, but I cut my set short by a few minutes, but he did  actually call and apologize yesterday, which, all right, fine.  You know what?  You say, we're sorry on the air and that's acceptable.  Yeah.  Cause I liked the club a lot.  Yeah.  It was a good club.  What's the name of the club?  It's the comedy club.  I'm glad you like it a lot.  In, um, Rochester.  No, but I mean the gig itself is 200 seats.  It's a great comedy club, man.  I used to live up there.  You know, Spencerport, New York?  You lived in Spencerport?  Dude, that's the last place I got arrested.  Why'd you live up there?  And I went to jail in Rochester. 
[02:34:00]  The juvie jail up there.  That was the last jail I went into.  I stole a gumbo machine.  But, I lived, I worked on a farm up in Spencerport.  Yeah.  Up there, dude.  Yeah.  I did time in Rochester.  I was on a bowling league.  It was all kind of hick shit.  Yeah, you're a real big guy.  Drank out of a keg?  Yeah, you're a real big guy.  Why did you make it to Rochester?  That's weird.  Dude, cause my family kept moving around.  Oh, they ended up over there.  He worked at Grossman's.  Remember Grossman's?  Yep.  Remember Grossman's?  It was the Orange, before Home Depot. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, it was, oh, right, right, right.  It was Home Depot.  Okay.  Yeah, he worked at Grossman's.  He was like a, and they would ship him around the country.  And we wound up in, I came out of a foster home and went to Ben Salem.  They were living there.  So, I had to move up there.  And fucking work on a farm.  Ugh, fucking crazy.  Skull with a gumball machine, huh?  I was telling you last night, that's the wrestler.  I was talking about wrestlers, how strong wrestlers are, how freaks of nature.  I would never fight a wrestler.  Oh, yeah, where's Shane calling?  And I fucking, I got into a fight with a wrestler, a little kid. 
[02:35:00]  He was on the wrestling team.  He just picked me up, body slammed me on my head on cement.  Really?  I was just done.  I was like, okay, that's good.  I just walked home with a limp.  Kicked your ass?  Two seconds.  Wow.  But he wasn't even doing it to be a dick.  He just grabbed me, threw me on my head, cement.  I was like, all right, I'm done.  That's when I used to, we used to party in the, you know, the rednecks, the hicks.  When you're out in the woods, you go out in the woods and fucking chop down trees and  build forts.  Yeah, you build like a corral area and fire pit in there and fire, whiskey, beer, and 
[02:35:30]  just fucking whatever.  Just dangerous.  Yeah.  Nothing scares me more than a fucking redneck woods drinking.  Yeah, I used to get fucked.  I could, yeah, because I was from the city, dude.  I don't mind the city, but being in the woods with dudes with belt buckles and fucking knives.  Belt buckles.  Yeah, you got to watch those.  Yeah, I hate men who don't want their pants to fall down.  I know you do.  It's not easy access.  I know you do, faggot. 
[02:36:00]  Belt buckles is scary.  The guy might put your pants up or something.  Adam Carolla is in trouble.  Who the fuck is that?  You don't want to know.  Keep asking.  U.S. Comedians attack on, how do you say this guy's name?  He's a fighter?  Pacquiao.  Pacquiao.  Manny Pacquiao.  Manny Pacquiao angers Philippines.  The Philippines on Monday angrily hit back at U.S. radio personality who said the nation  had nothing going for it except boxing hero Manny and sex tours, branding him an ignorant 
[02:36:30]  fool.  In a profanity-laced podcast, Italian-American Adam Carolla also called Manny a fucking idiot  who prays to chicken bones for refusing demands by American rival Floyd Mayweather for an Olympic-style  drug test.  They got this Manny and sex tours.  That's all they have over there.  Get your shit together, Philippines.  Jesus Christ.  I mean, again, it's fine to be proud.  It's fine to be proud of your countrymen, but that's it.  That's all you got.  So, he's in trouble for what he said on a podcast? 
[02:37:00]  How is that possible?  Yeah, apparently, Adam Carolla was one of the big CBS firings, I guess, when they just  decided, let's get rid of everything that has any personality and throw on music.  That was We Went.  That was their brilliant idea.  Like Us Went.  Everybody just kind of went.  Everybody.  They tossed everyone out and just play music because it's cheaper.  So, Adam Carolla decided to do a podcast. 
[02:37:30]  So, he doesn't have a boss.  He's not getting paid for a podcast.  He doesn't have, like, sponsors or anything.  It's just him doing a podcast.  So, who is he in trouble with?  I don't know.  You can still just do it.  It's like, all right, well, I hope my boss doesn't meet with him.  But you're your boss.  Yeah, don't tell me they're going to go after podcasts now.  Yeah.  This is Adam Carolla.  The deal with the Manny Pacquiao thing, and it's a cultural thing.  We don't realize how sort of quietly racist we all are because Pacquiao doesn't believe, 
[02:38:00]  he says he doesn't give blood the month of a fight or a week before the fight because  somehow it's going to weaken him and what have you.  And I've got to tell you, if that was a white fighter and probably even a black fighter,  if the black fighter was from Atlanta or somewhere like that, someone would go,  what the fuck are you talking about?  Give your drop of blood.  It's not going to make a difference, you know. 
[02:38:30]  But because he's from the Philippines and because he's, you know, praying to chicken bones and  stuff like that, everyone's kind of like, well, you've got to respect him for his belief  system.  No, you don't.  He's a fucking idiot.  Good for Adam.  What's the problem with that?  Yeah.  What's the problem with the guy saying that?  Well, they're saying he's an ignorant fool who belongs to a sick minority in the United  States.  Presidential spokesman Gary Oliver told AFP.  A sick minority, yes. 
[02:39:00]  People who speak honestly.  A sick minority.  Carolla continued.  Here's how you know your country doesn't have a lot going for it when everything is about  Manny Pacquiao.  Like, could you imagine, could you imagine, just imagine this, what if Ray Boom Boom Mancini  went to the Philippines to fight and then all, that was all the United States was about.  Oh, man, did you see Boom Boom Mancini? 
[02:39:30]  The town, the United States would close down when he would fight and then we'd come back  here, he'd run for president and everything would be, it'd be, it'd be Ray Boom Boom Mancini  mania.  Can you, can you, can you, get a fucking life as a, as a country, right?  I agree, man.  Because all you fucking got is this illiterate guy who won't give up blood, who happens to  smash other guys in the head better than other people?  That's all you have is the Philippines?  You know, everyone does that thing all the time and they're like, oh, they are so proud  of their native son. 
[02:40:00]  They, they think the world of him.  When he comes home, he comes home to a heroes parade.  He's going to run for Congress in the Philippines and win handling.  Really?  You want some guy with brain damage running your country?  Why don't you get your shit together?  They got this and sex tours.  That's all they have over there.  Get your shit together, Philippines.  Wow.  Yeah, the nerve of Adam to speak honestly and just express an opinion.  Fuck anybody's offended by that.  Good for him.  Just do that?  They continue by saying his statements carry zero weight for us.  We will not dignify it by demanding an apology. 
[02:40:30]  In fact, he should apologize to his fellow Americans for giving them a collective black  eye.  All right.  Hey, you know what?  His statements don't mean anything to us.  They shouldn't.  They absolutely shouldn't.  Then they shouldn't have said that.  They shouldn't have said that.  They shouldn't have said anything if it doesn't mean anything.  Yeah.  And then finally, one more clip from Adam.  It pisses me off when other countries just do that whole thing.  There's one guy.  He's five foot six.  He's 147 pounds.  And he's good at punching other guys in the head. 
[02:41:00]  And you're going to build your entire, you're going to build your entire country around  this guy?  Then what happens when he loses?  What happens when Floyd Mayweather beats him?  Then what?  The whole country goes into depression?  Jesus, you know you've got nothing going.  They talk about it in the barbershop.  Yeah.  We've got nothing.  When it was around.  That's the beauty of this country.  We've got way too much shit going on in this country. 
[02:41:30]  There's so many different things going on that you couldn't possibly just build your  entire existence around LeBron James or Tiger Woods or whoever.  You can go like, all right, that guy's cool.  Some people do.  He's a good golfer.  And then you move on.  Hey, Academy Awards is on.  Let's watch that.  But it doesn't star LeBron James.  It's like the Philippines.  That's it.  That's all they got.  That's all they got.  Yeah.  But I mean, Philippines is a lot smaller than fucking America.  And it's a little shit country that they have one good guy. 
[02:42:00]  We do that with everybody.  You just said what he did.  Yeah.  But no.  But I understand.  We do the same thing.  We just have more fucking.  We do that with LeBron James.  We do that with Michael Jordan.  Tiger Woods.  Tiger Woods.  We do that with all of them.  We haven't shut up about Tiger Woods.  Fucking Oscars.  Who gives a fuck?  It's rich people winning awards for pretending at the highest level.  And we all sit around the TV every night.  Yeah.  Bobby.  Man.  You got your coffee.  You watched the Academy Awards.  You know what, dude? 
[02:42:30]  I reward the guy who delivers the mail.  You know what, dude?  That's an American.  Shut up.  I like actors who are famous.  You do?  Yes.  Yeah, but who gives a fuck?  I do.  I like to meet them.  Yeah, but we do the same thing.  He's saying that we don't do it.  We got too much going on.  No, we don't.  We're the ones who invented that shit.  Yeah.  That is true.  We're the ones who invented fucking putting some douchebag out in them.  And this is what our country's about.  But he's justifying it just by saying we have more shit to fuck around with. 
[02:43:00]  Like, that's what he's saying.  Because we're fucking.  He's just saying, oh, you know, you have Tiger Woods and then you move on to this and then that.  It's like, yeah, well, we're a bigger country.  We got more shit.  Yeah.  But the Philippines, like, I think they realize there's no one they can complain to.  So why bother?  They probably looked into it for two seconds and said, wait a minute.  He was thrown off the air.  He's doing a podcast for free.  Actually, they Googled.  Out of his house.  They Googled Philippines and all they came up with was sex tours and Manny Pacquiao.  Yeah.  And is that false?  I have no idea.  What else do we know about the Philippines? 
[02:43:30]  Philippines has the hottest fucking Asian women.  That's the best.  No, they don't.  Oh, fuck you.  You stick your tongue up their ass.  Google image, Danny.  It's a Spanish mix.  It's a Spanish.  Let's take a look.  Fucking Asian mix.  They got tan skin.  I think you're confusing them with Tahitian.  No.  Let's take a look.  Tahitian?  Tahiti.  Smell some more cum.  Girls like Tahiti.  You know, those Tahiti girls.  Like fucking SS Bounty.  Stop chewing gum.  HMS Bounty.  I thought you wanted me to eat cum. 
[02:44:00]  I didn't know.  And he's just chewing.  Sorry.  All right.  Let's take a look at these women from the Philippines.  Sorry.  I didn't know this was fucking CNN.  I apologize.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  All right.  They're obviously all right, but they're Asian girls.  As far as Asians go, Philippines are the fucking best ones.  What about the asses?  That's always a major problem.  Which one is the worst?  Oh, look at that.  Look at that.  Chinese.  Right here.  Right here.  No, I'm joking.  Right here.  Look at that.  That's a Philippine ass.  Look how dirty it is.  It's a little harsh.  Oh, that's a thong. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, it's a black thong.  I thought that was some tiny dirt.  Oh, that's not just terrible.  Tiny dirt.  That looks like fucking...  Get the fuck out of here.  Look at the fucking...  She's got youth on her side, but get the fuck out of here, Bobby.  Dude, I like that little heart-shaped ass.  What are you, out of your mind?  It's not heart-shaped.  It's fucking bopsy, but it's like a human heart.  Type in Vietnamese.  Watch what comes up.  Watch what comes up.  It's not the sexy heart-shaped.  Look how dark the skin is in between the fucking pussy lips and the...  Shaped like the band heart. 
[02:45:00]  Or heart-to-heart.  I can't think of any more.  Wouldn't the Thai women be the hottest, though, Bobby?  No, Thai women are the...  Aren't as good as the Filipino women?  Oh, God.  What a wreck.  See that?  No, you're out of your mind.  No, Filipino's the best.  No, I don't think so.  Tahiti.  I guarantee.  I think Tahiti.  Tahiti.  I think Tahiti's got hot girls.  I don't know.  Fucking mutiny on the bounty.  That's what I mean.  Like the mutiny on the bounty chicks.  All right.  Type in Tahiti.  Let's see what happens.  All right.  Let's look at Tahiti now.  Let's go around the world.  Go down to that one.  Pussy around the world. 
[02:45:30]  Pussy around the world.  Yeah, maybe.  You know what?  That's better than Philippines.  No, but look at that nose.  Go back to Tahiti and look at that freaking.  Fuck Tahiti.  Oh, she.  Dude.  Actually, Tahiti looks pretty good.  Look at that.  Go back to that nose.  What nose?  Look at.  Watch this nose.  Go back to that Tahiti shake.  All the better to fucking massage the bottom of your ball bag with.  Look at that wide nose.  Nothing wrong with that.  That's all right.  That fucking flower hat is horrible.  All right.  It really is.  She's going to fucking. 
[02:46:00]  Can you go with Thai, please?  She's going to be fat someday.  All right.  Thailand.  Thailand.  Now we're going to Thailand.  And check out.  I think that's winning.  No way.  Filipino.  Tahitian.  Wasn't as good as Tahitian.  Tahitian had unconditioned hair and big flat noses.  Oh, boy.  No, they didn't.  Yeah, they did.  Go back.  She's wearing a flower hat.  How could you tell?  There you go.  Show them that one.  Come flower hat.  Sexy Thai.  All right.  Yeah, type in sexy Filipino then.  Sexy Thai.  That's Thai.  Let's go sexy.  That's Thai.  Forbidden.  That's not good. 
[02:46:30]  Forbidden there, too.  That's what Thai is.  That freaking gray nipple and that white skin.  Forbidden.  Gray nipple.  Yeah, they all have gray nipples.  Look, gray nipples.  That's pretty fucking good, Bobby.  That's like the best Thai ever.  Look at her big teardrop tits.  I bet she has Filipino in her.  Yeah.  She has big teardrop tits.  Yeah, what was wrong with that, Bobby?  There you go.  There you go.  That's what I'm talking about.  Exactly.  Fucking assholes.  Stupid links.  Beg to differ.  That one's not that good. 
[02:47:00]  That looks like prostitution.  Look at that shiny sack.  Jesus.  Look at that shiny ball bag.  That's really not good.  That's, yeah.  It's just a trimmed up.  That's a gentleman dressed as a woman.  No, it's not.  Look at that little fucking gray ball bag.  Anthony's right, though.  Every picture looks like there's some kind of prostitution going on.  Yeah.  Why can't we get just a regular Thai woman?  Because they don't exist.  Thai lady.  But don't put Thai lady, boy.  Why not?  Just let him do what he's going to do. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, God.  Look at this.  Look at that.  There you go.  Uncut and big sack hanging down like Turkish taffy.  Oh, look at that.  Thai lady, boy.  Underneath his pubes, it's just gray dead skin.  How would you know that?  Because you can see it.  Look at it.  You can't just come up with that.  Oh, God.  Look at it.  Look at it.  You can see it right there.  Oh, God.  Man.  All right.  Well.  Exactly.  Room full of hard-ons now.  Thanks.  What's the best she-man?  All right, hold on.  This guy's a Marine.  This guy's going to fucking tell us what's up. 
[02:48:00]  Sparks in Oklahoma.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, brother.  Bobby, you're exactly right.  I love you.  Flips are the hottest Asians around.  In the late 80s, early 90s, that's been the suck in the Marine Corps.  We went to Phuket, Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Philippines, Singapore, everywhere.  Get pumped over there.  The best ones.  The best whores in the world are flips.  All right.  Hold on.  What about the Thai women?  He just said that. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  I went to Phuket.  They're number two.  There's no doubt about it.  All right.  And then Japanese are three.  The Hong Kong, which were Chinese, were terrible.  Just ugly wall biters.  They all smell like haddock.  Where was Anthony's then?  What do you have?  Taiwan?  Tahiti.  Tahiti.  Tahiti.  I mean, what about Tahiti?  What about what?  Tahiti.  There you go.  I've never been there.  Nobody's been to Tahiti since there was a wooden ship. 
[02:49:00]  There's a wooden ship.  Nobody's gone.  What the fuck is Tahiti?  That's just it.  They don't know anything.  You come there, everybody's like, oh, let's fuck you.  You go there, you can.  You go to Tahiti, you can still fuck them for nails.  Like, just trade metal.  For some molasses.  And you say the wrong thing and they cave your head in while you're sleeping.  Yeah, like cook.  There you go.  A little history.  Fucking Anthony.  Watch that shit.  He fucking knows everything. 
[02:49:30]  All right.  We got a little something for everybody.  Listen to this.  Listen to this.  Yeah, I like to shoot him right now.  Locked in his cage, it's clear Noah is in big trouble.  Bill Hamrick is furious that the seven-year-old monkey attacked his brother again.  The second time in two weeks.  Though this time his brother needed surgery.  He looks worse than what he did the first time.  Because he had blood completely all over him.  Noah's owner, Joseph Babe Hamrick, was feeding Noah a pork chop when the monkey went berserk. 
[02:50:00]  Chomping Hamrick's calves and severing his left pinky finger.  Joseph Hamrick choked Noah until the animal passed out and put him back in his cage.  After the first attack, Joseph Hamrick said he couldn't bear to lose the monkey.  He would probably kill me.  I'll tell you what he'd do.  I wouldn't be able to handle it.  Seriously.  But Noah's owner is now reconsidering Noah's fate.  Telling his brother he was ready to get rid of the monkey.  So I'll be honest, I'm scared of him. 
[02:50:30]  And I told Babe, you know, he needs to put him down.  Animal Control says it can't do anything because the attacks are in the owner's home.  Plus, Hamrick has an exotic pet license.  So this guy's got a monkey that just keeps attacking him.  That's fantastic.  Why would you have a monkey in your house at this point?  People like monkeys.  They're cute.  You dress them up like little engineers.  Remember watching Little Rascals? 
[02:51:00]  How fun it looked when Spanky had a monkey?  Why didn't he have a monkey?  Because Spanky always had a little monkey.  Oh, he didn't have a monkey?  He had a monkey and he dressed in a little beret and he put a little engineer outfit on it.  Yeah, Spanky had a monkey.  Not all the time.  Did he really have a monkey?  Yeah.  When my back pension comes in, I'll get you that monkey Spanky.  How do you remember that line?  Jesus.  There's something wrong with you, dude.  My sister had a baby monkey, you know what I said? 
[02:51:30]  What?  I said, I was like, I'm going to be a monkey's uncle.  Oh, Chip, because...  I can't stand you.  I know.  What would you have done if you didn't get to do comedy?  I just want to know, if you didn't get to do this for a living, what fucking creep you  would have been at some fucking warehouse just bugging everybody.  I would have been 70 pounds heavier if I'm having a forklift.  That monkey's got some fucking fangs.  Yeah.  Holy shit. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  All right, let's go to Steve in Pennsylvania.  Steve.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning, Steve.  Hey, you know, Bob, usually I think you're a bit of a fucking idiot, but this morning I  got to agree with you, man.  One of my...  First of all, that's no way to start a conversation.  It really isn't.  There's no way.  Growing up, back in the day, you know, my brother was in Vietnam, and when he was doing  a little R&R on leave, he went to the Philippines, and sitting at the dinner table, having a  little something to eat, my father just takes this letter from my brother, throws it up in  the air, starts motherfucking, and this little picture kind of floated down, you know, out 
[02:52:30]  of the air onto the table, and it was this Filipino chick that my brother hooked up with,  and, you know, said he was going to marry her and bring her home, have a couple kids,  the whole thing, and she was fucking gorgeous, man.  So I got to agree with you, man.  Did he marry her?  No, he didn't marry her.  I, you know, he was on leave for like a month, and a couple letters home, you know, that  he was going to do the dirty deed, and for whatever reason, he would never talk about 
[02:53:00]  it when he came home.  You know, he just, he left it out.  Because he had to kill her?  Yeah, right.  She had a cock, and he just fucking killed her, and took the cock, and made it into a key  chain.  All right.  Wonderful.  Filipinos are the best.  Did you ever, that fucking monkey, though, that's not like a monkey, that guy, that's  like a humanzy.  What's a humanzy?  You ever saw a humanzy?  No, what's a humanzy?  I don't know what a humanzy is.  You never saw that show, Humanzy?  No.  It's got to be a human chimpanzee. 
[02:53:30]  Right?  What's the humanzy?  Ah, the fucking load smell is everywhere.  What's the humanzy?  Right there, that's a humanzy.  What is a humanzy?  It's the humanzy.  That's like a human, half-human, half-fucking-man.  That's not half-human.  No, this is a whole, they thought this fucking, this humanzy was the fucking, yeah, exactly.  Is that a hominid?  They actually, they checked its DNA, and it wasn't all fucking chimp.  Chimpanzee.  That thing is just an old chimp. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, come on, Bobby.  It's just an old, bald chimp.  Why are you buying into this crap?  No, I'm not buying into it.  I'm just telling you what it is.  I'm humanzy.  Look it, look it.  Show them the fucking little mat one.  Do you believe in jackalopes, too?  Show them that one.  Those jackrabbits with the antelope fucking jackalopes.  And fucking Bigfoot.  Or Chupacabra.  Or whatever that fucking fictional thing is.  Or Bigfoot?  Or the Yeti.  Humanzy.  Did you spot the Yeti?  The Jersey Devil?  Yeah.  The Jersey Devil was driving a fucking Prius.  And his little cloven hoof couldn't hit the brake. 
[02:54:30]  I can't get in.  I got to 100 feet from my house.  Does he drive a Prius?  Yes.  Yes.  The Jersey Devil.  Yes.  What a dumb legend that was.  You didn't like the Jersey Devil?  The Jersey Devil stunk.  Why?  I'm fucked up.  It's just awful.  Hangs out in South Jersey in the woods with fucking a little jacket.  Ah, look at the Photoshop.  Job on that.  That looks good.  It's a deer running through the woods being chased by the Jersey Devil.  That's the Jersey Devil, huh?  Yeah, there's a fucking shadow on the picture from where it was held up and re-photographed. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  It's horrible.  It's got to be real because they named their hockey team after it.  Yeah.  It's true.  So it's got to be real.  I didn't think about that.  New Jersey Devil, so they must be real.  You don't believe in any of that shit?  Like, do you think we found everything there is on the planet?  Yes.  Yes.  Everything.  Everything.  Pretty much, except for maybe some dumb little insect somewhere.  What about in the ocean?  Something way down deep in the ocean, but it's like not a big sea monster.  It's probably some little fucking guppy.  Yeah, some slow-moving thing.  Little light bulb on its head.  Glowing head, right?  Yeah. 
[02:55:30]  Hey, there's going to be an EAS test in 30 seconds, so it's going to fuck up the rest of  this break.  So why don't we just break so the EAS test could go over some horse shit?  We'll be back with Bob.  We've got Robert Kelly live in studio.  It's robertkellylive.com for all his cancer dates, doing the stand-up thing.  And we're playing a little Beatles for Bob Kelly because we learned during the break  that Bobby hates the Beatles.  I fucking hate them.  Hey!  I talked up the record right to the post and you fucked me up.  I don't get it.  Right to the vocals. 
[02:56:00]  I did that.  What's the post?  Sorry, Ophie.  I apologize.  What's a post?  Listen to the replay.  I played it perfectly and then Bobby stepped up.  Paul's wife had on one leg.  See, if I didn't fuck it up, he would have never said that brilliant joke.  That's good.  That's why this opiate show works.  Bobby, so what's up with you and the Beatles?  Why do you hate the Beatles?  I fucking hate them.  Why?  I don't get it.  Because they listen to it.  Why?  How can you say you hate the Beatles?  I fucking hate it.  They suck.  You know what?  I found an iPod around five years ago at the cellar and they had every Beatles song ever 
[02:56:30]  on this fucking thing.  And I put it on my iTunes and now it's on my iPhone.  I just got sick of it.  Dude, you're working out in the middle.  You got fucking some crazy shit on.  Some Slipknot or fucking Skid Row.  And you rock, you know, fucking rocking it out.  And then fucking this dumb song pops on.  Sucks all the life out of me. 
[02:57:00]  I just want to fucking fall asleep on the treadmill.  Beatles have some good songs.  They suck.  You are crazy.  Name one fucking good song.  Let it be.  Let it be.  Fucking in my life.  It's the same chorus over and over.  How many times do they say the chorus over and over?  Let it be.  Let it be.  A bunch.  Let it be.  Let it be.  Let it be.  Let it be.  If I fucking shut the fuck up, we get it.  How about in my life?  It's a great song, too.  Listen how many fucking times they sing this chorus.  You don't like in my life is Lennon.  It's amazing. 
[02:57:30]  I don't mind Lennon as much as I fucking hate.  You're a communist.  Listen.  Remember.  They're not fucking American.  They're English.  Who gives a shit?  What the fuck does that mean?  It's not like I'm saying I hate Bruce Springsteen.  We've embraced them.  What about some of their trippier stuff?  Like what?  Play me something.  Play me something rockin'.  How about I Am the Walrus?  Kaku Kachu.  Play me something that compares to Van Halen's.  How about Helter Skelter?  Play them Helter Skelter.  Van Halen's Panama.  That's a fucking song.  It is. 
[02:58:00]  But the rest of the Panama stuff is Van Halen's.  You don't like Van Halen?  They stink.  I like Van Halen.  Panama?  You could have picked a better song than Panama.  And Jump.  No, I love.  Hot Fatiche.  No, that.  Really?  Are ya?  Okay.  Okay.  Terrible.  I'm not saying that all is fucking great.  What's good by them?  It's fucking Van Halen 1 and 2?  Those are fucking the cradle will rock?  That's a good song.  Fucking Pretty Woman?  Pretty Woman isn't a good song?  It's decent, yes.  You cannot listen to David Lee Roth.  He's awful.  Can't listen to it.  Van Halen, David Lee Roth, Panama? 
[02:58:30]  Can't listen to anything David Lee Roth does.  Are you kidding me?  Panama is great.  Panama is great.  I love Panama.  He's terrible.  I wanted to play I Am the Walrus for you.  White Stripes?  I fucking love the White Stripes.  Love the White Stripes.  Now you're talking.  They're fucking...  Now you're talking.  I can listen to anything he does.  His name's Jack White.  Jack White.  I know.  Jack White.  I just saw his fucking...  His documentaries, The Northern Lights.  That's fucking great.  What is that?  They did a documentary.  It was touring Canada.  Him and his sister.  They would just go to the...  It's not his sister.  Who is it?  That's his sister.  No, it's not.  It's his cousin, Matilda. 
[02:59:00]  That was the thing they threw out there.  They're not brother and sister.  I didn't know that.  I didn't know that.  Meg?  Yeah, it's not his sister?  No, it's not his sister.  Do they fuck?  I don't know what the fuck the relationship was, but they...  Are you kidding me, dude?  He actually...  It might have been an ex or something.  They're divorced.  Yeah.  They were married.  Okay.  Wait a minute.  So Jack White didn't marry his sister.  So I guess they were married and then they got divorced, but they kept the band together  because they did some good things.  Why does he call her his sister? 
[02:59:30]  In the documentary he did, It Might Get Loud.  For a goof.  It Might Get Loud was good, wasn't it?  That was fucking great.  He was fucking great.  Yeah.  I didn't know...  You know what's so weird about that?  You don't know that all that crazy shit goes into the guitar?  Yeah.  Yeah.  When fucking Edge admitted that this riff is all it is is this?  Yeah.  It's like, fucking dude, you can play it, but then if you kick this button and flip it...  He turns on all this shit and then gets that classic U2 sound, but before that it was  just a ting, tling, tling, tling. 
[03:00:00]  The Edge is the most fucking notorious with using effects to make him sound.  But at least he admitted it during It's It Might Get Loud.  He is an effects guy with a computer and hooked up to all that shit and fucking...  We talked about this movie.  A lot of people saw it after we talked about it.  It's a great one.  Jimmy Page ruled in that.  He's fucking...  He's still fucking happening.  Jack White fucking ruled in that, dude.  He is...  He's fucking bleeding on his guitar with a microphone built into it.  That's fucking crazy.  Well, did you see the documentary yet, Ed?  Didn't see it yet, no.  It starts with Jack White just building a homemade guitar like they did way back whenever 
[03:00:30]  the blues guys did.  Dude, but it's just crazy.  It was cool, and then he played it like, look at this.  Dude, he gets an old Coke bottle and a fucking nail, and then he's playing a riff that's  actually really good, kind of good.  You know what I mean?  Who is?  Jack White.  He's fucking crazy.  But he's actually kind of funny, too.  How great was it when Jimmy Page was playing some great Zeppelin stuff, and those guys  are just admiring the hell out of him?  This photo right here, though, this is why Jack kind of bugs me to go up a little bit.  This photo right here, he reminds me of this fucking Jewish girl who used to bang down 
[03:01:00]  the village.  Ew.  That's a great visual joke right there.  He does look like a Jewish girl you would bang down in the village.  You know what I mean?  That's classic.  All right.  Oh, fucking Bobby Jack White is the shit.  All right, but you don't like the Beatles.  That's too bad.  No, why would you like the fucking...  I don't like all Beatles, but there's...  I like their trippier stuff.  Give me one rockin' song.  Let me hear one rockin' song.  Thank you, Travis.  I am the walrus.  Kukuk Kachoo.  Mass doesn't really rock.  Dude, they're great, though. 
[03:01:30]  They're just a great band.  I don't want to believe you.  I wish I didn't like them.  I don't need the Beatles to rock, though.  Yeah, I don't either.  I'll just, you know, listen to...  Do you have them on your iPod?  Everything.  I don't have any Beatles on my iPod, though.  I wish I didn't.  How do you get them off?  How do you get them off?  One bullet, brain cancer, and we don't know what the other two ways are.  Was it one bullet that killed John?  Talent malnutrition.  No, a few, but I just...  How do you not like this?  I don't get it.  Okay. 
[03:02:00]  Sitting on a cornflake.  Yeah, that makes sense.  Yeah.  No one did anything for a movie like this.  Waiting for a van to come.  Operation T-shirts.  Man!  Man!  He's the Eggman.  What are they talking about?  He's the walrus.  He's the walrus.  Sounds like he just made that up on the spot right there. 
[03:02:30]  Of course he did.  Yeah.  Too many pauses.  Okay.  This is a good one.  All right, here you go.  Good.  Tell me this song isn't fucking rocking.  All right.  Stop that fucking...  Dude, we have a...  Psychedelic horse shit.  Wait, we got a fucking system here.  We don't have to play it through your stupid phone.  Yeah, absolutely.  Absolutely.  Fucking running on a treadmill.  Fucking yeah!  This is the shit. 
[03:03:00]  Listen to that fucking...  Keep it going, brother.  That's the shit.  Keep it going.  Good sound quality through the iPhone speaker into a mic.  Listen to fucking...  Who is this?  This is Jack White's band.  What is it?  White Stripes.  No, this is the...  Oh, no.  Oh, this is the Rock and Core.  Rock and Core.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  Rock and Core.  Do you think fine?  Oh, oh.  Can I let you hear this?  I like a rapper plant ripoff.  What?  I like rap too, but I have this song that I love that I can't listen to at the gym anymore 
[03:03:30]  and it comes on my track.  Why?  It makes you cry?  Dude, because I wind up singing it out loud.  I always wind up kind of singing things out loud once in a while.  That's embarrassing.  Dude, I sing it out loud all the time and I fucking...  I'm going to get the shit kicked out of me, dude.  All right, let's hear this.  Hang on.  Hang on.  A rap song?  Yeah, a rap song.  I'm going to find it, so it's going to take me a minute.  Is it Jay-Z?  Don't stare at me.  No, it's not Jay-Z.  Does it have a fucking iPhone case with a credit card holder in it?  Yes. 
[03:04:00]  Yes, absolutely.  It's...  So that way you could lose your phone and your credit card at the same time.  Yeah, yeah, lose everything.  You know what, though?  That's kind of cool, no?  Oh, dude, when you fly, this is the best thing ever.  Why not?  It's cool.  I put my wallet in my bag and then boom, and if I have to buy something, I'm done, and it's  right here.  Boom, bang.  I think that's kind of cool, man.  Yeah, boom, dude, you got your phone, you got your license.  He just did it.  You know what, dude?  Boom.  I put the thing in the bag.  Boom.  Is that the one just carried it?  That's the first time I really did it in life, though, right?  Like, you caught me.  You always do it.  He had his coffee with him. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, boom, you got your coffee, you got your license.  Just play it.  Boom.  Nobody...  I'd rather hear it through your phone.  All right, you want to hear it through the phone?  Yeah.  Bobby's trying to turn this on to fucking music through his phone.  I can't fucking...  I can't...  I got to take it off my thing, because I wound up just literally...  I love the song.  I fucking love it.  All right, let's go, let's go.  All right, here we go.  It's a good thing you hate the Beatles.  Hang on, hang on. 
[03:05:00]  Sing it out loud for us.  Make way of you in the gym.  Go ahead, Bobby.  Go.  Hey.  This is playing on Easter.  I only know one word in this song.  Fucking Times Square.  I only know one word in this song.  Cracker.  Motherfucker.  Hang on.  Here we go.  I sing part of this song every drive home.  Only a very small part.  Yeah, you can't sing this out loud. 
[03:05:30]  And it's actually Ice King's part.  This is...  Danny, here you go.  It's just a happy nigga. 
[03:06:00]  And I'm a nappy nigga.  Fuck your scrappy nigga.  Meet your pappy nigga.  It's Ice Cube nigga.  And little child nigga.  So if you're drunk nigga.  Keep it drunk nigga.  Keep it drunk nigga.  Do the bump nigga.  Get your testifying ass in the trunk nigga.  You wanna talk nigga?  I'm dumb machine nigga.  Bobby's lip syncing for us in the studio.  You can't...  Ice Cube.  I fucking can't not sing it.  Ice Cube's fucking...  I've never heard that.  Is it old, new?  This is old.  This is old.  It sounds old school. 
[03:06:30]  But the way he says fucking...  It's just fucking...  Yeah!  Get your testifying ass in the trunk nigga!  I like that old school shit.  I told Patrice that too.  There's certain times...  Like I love the way Patrice says nigga.  He just says it and it's just fucking...  I don't know.  Because he says it like differently every time.  Like if I say something that surprises him.  Nigga!  Yeah, yeah.  He says it and it just rolls...  It's just fucking fun.  I wanna say it.  It's just rough.  It's like fuck.  I suggest that you do.  It's just rough.  It's just like you're saying fuck.  Like fuck.  Yeah, nigga!  It's just rough that you said you hate the Beatles and then you give that as an example 
[03:07:00]  of something you like.  No, no.  I'm not saying it.  There's a bit of a drop off between the two.  That was a side track.  No, that was a side track.  I actually liked that.  That was a good song, right?  Yeah, that was good.  That was a flash sideways.  Huh?  I understand.  You liked it?  Thanks.  Yeah, I like that.  From 2004?  I like old school kind of...  I love that fucking song.  Even older than 2004 I like, that's for sure.  But that, you know, anytime they're talking about fucking killing shit and fucking...  Yeah, I like that.  Fucking bitches up and get your tussle in the trunk, nigga. 
[03:07:30]  Fucking dope man, dope man.  Remember that shit?  And cruising down the street in my sixth vault.  Remember?  Oh, then you're gonna fuck...  You love this shit.  This is the fucking...  This is the best song.  This is the best ever.  All right, we got another one from your phone?  The best ever.  Ever.  Ever, kid.  Kid, you're gonna fucking love this.  Did you see the Red Sox the other night?  Fucking kid.  Is this one of your favorite fucking songs of all time?  Yeah, we'll see what happens tonight.  Uh...  Yeah.  What do you mean, tonight?  What's gonna happen tonight? 
[03:08:00]  We play again, don't we?  Fucking play again.  I know, I'm kidding.  I don't know why, by the way...  Dude, this song.  Oh, here we go.  Remember this shit?  Love this song.  And then fucking bust it.  It's a hauled off.  You too, boy, if you fuck with me.  Don't put me on the floor.  The police are gonna have to come and get me.  Off your ass.  That's how I'm going out.  For the punk motherfuckers that are showing out.  Nigga start to rumble.  You wanna mumble.  Mix a man, cook them in a pot like gumbo.  Oh, shit! 
[03:08:30]  That's pointed at your ass.  Give it up smooth.  Ain't no telling when I'm down for a gap move.  Keep you dancing.  The crime record, like Charles Manson.  AK-47 is the two.  Motherfucker you.  Toto, no daily.  Ice boob.  Ice boob.  Ice boob.  This is a little better.  This is like...  It's not as hardcore, but it's kind of cool.  The Candyman can't...  Hi, Jimmy. 
[03:09:00]  I like that song.  He's got the Candyman on him.  The Candyman can't raise his hand.  Everything he makes to.  Satisfying and delicious.  Oh!  Talk about your childhood wishes.  You can even eat the dishes.  Oh, Kenya.  This is the fucking shit.  I'll take this over that shit.  Who can pop his eye out?  And not stay in the same hotel. 
[03:09:30]  Dad, this song is the fucking...  All right, go ahead.  Back to Bobby.  Dad, you don't like this fucking...  We got phone wars.  You don't like this song?  This is good.  Yeah, I like this one.  Fuck you, dude.  You can't...  It's hard to say I don't like this one.  You can't fucking be driving on a fucking...  You don't like this air?  Come on.  Driving down the Garden State, fucking swerving in and out of cars,  trying to get to fucking Paramus,  to get to that Chick-fil-A at the mall.  Fucking no.  Shut up, David. 
[03:10:00]  Here we go, David.  He's just losing his mind, dancing and air drumming.  Van Whalen.  All right.  All right, how about this?  Are you like that?  I actually like that song, but I'll take this over Van Halen any day.  Honestly.  Jimmy's fine. 
[03:10:30]  It's a good song.  Love Balloon.  Love Balloon, actually.  How the fuck do you have that?  I don't even know.  Why don't you have it is the true question.  You should have that one, Bobby.  Exactly.  I like to do poppers and get blown through a hole in the wall.  Remember this band?  You got to remember this fucking band.  All right.  All right.  Remember this band?  I don't know how we did.  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[03:11:00]  You don't remember this fucking band?  Here we go.  Ready?  Hard to tell.  I can't believe this fucked up world in which we're living in.  Still, I do the best that I can.  I was driving.  Fuck yeah.  The only Tesla song I really know, though.  Signs, signs, everywhere.  I'm a rock and roll man. 
[03:11:30]  I follow your tweets.  That's right.  You like Tesla.  Dude, fucking Tesla is the shit.  How do you like Tesla as much as you do?  Dude, they're the fucking most underrated awesome band ever.  What was another song that everyone should know from that band?  Dude, everybody should know coming at you live.  Easy come, easy go.  Nope.  Nope.  Easy come, easy go, dude.  You remember this song?  I'm doing it, dude.  I'm doing it.  What do you got? 
[03:12:00]  This is Anthony's phone.  Who's that?  Come on, you tell me.  Shit.  I like it.  You know who this is?  Ah, but I like it.  Come on.  Who is that?  Scorpions.  Oh, shit.  Oh, they were on Red Eye last night.  Scorpions.  Were they?  Yep.  Klaus and the guitarist.  Klaus.  Yeah, this is a good one.  Yeah, I love that fucking thing.  I'm not a fan of Tesla.  You're not a fan of fucking Tesla. 
[03:12:30]  I know.  I know it's one of your bands.  Fucking love it.  I was thinking of that one at the zoo.  Hold on.  Even better.  Yeah, it's the zoo.  The zoo, right?  Even better.  Jimmy.  Hold on.  Turn it down, Bobby.  Is mine on?  Oh, shit.  Sorry.  Even better.  Fucking Jimmy has some real shit.  Do you have any faggot songs on yours?  Can I tell you what I like at the gym? 
[03:13:00]  What?  Giving blowjobs?  I got a faggot song.  Are you ready?  You ready?  Bobby's got a sissy song.  I got a fucking sissy song.  You ready?  Yeah, let's hear your sissy song.  What's this song?  Wait.  Wait, if it kicks in, it gets rocking.  Oh, it's fucking the idle broad.  No?  It's how I picture me with you.  And now you'll ever hear me say. 
[03:13:30]  But since you've been gone.  Kelly Clarkson?  No, you're right, bro.  I can out-pussy you in a second.  All right, go ahead.  So far, they're loving Ant's Choice the best, the zoo.  Oh, fuck them.  I'm going to fuck that.  The love in the zoo.  I challenge you to not work out to this.  All right.  I got it.  Is.  That's is.  I fucking love is.  Of course you do.  You're built like him. 
[03:14:00]  Am I still that bad?  No.  No, you're all right.  I got him.  The best, the best is song.  Dude, I got the best is song ever.  Yeah, let's hear it.  Where is it?  Hawaiian.  Hawaiian.  Wait, where is it?  Here it is.  Right here.  Hawaiian Superman.  That is this.  Hawaiian Superman by Iz.  Wait.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  You don't know the song? 
[03:14:30]  Iz?  That's one.  Good.  Good.  What is that terrible?  Here we go.  Come on.  This is garbage.  You know this is good?  I am Superman.  Here we go.  One of my faves.  You know this one? 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  I can't hear it.  Fucking no.  No.  No.  Who is it?  T.O.'s in it.  Oh, there's Rainbow.  Yeah.  This is fucking Ronnie James.  I get the same old dreams, same time every night.  Fall to the ground and I wake up.  This is my fag song.  That song is faggy.  It's a little faggy.  It's a little faggy.  It used to rock.  Oh, here it comes.  These small walls are closing in. 
[03:15:30]  Look at the facts you put in.  Love that.  It's not a bad song.  You want to hear a gay song?  Come on.  This is my gay song.  That's my gay song.  Oh, my God.  I listen to this.  Wait.  I listen to this in airports when I'm going on the road and when I get to the gig in the  airport while I'm on the people movers.  Wait.  I could probably outgay everybody. 
[03:16:00]  The only way you're going to outgay this is if you suck my cock right now while you hum  this song.  You're an emotional wreck, aren't you?  Oh, yeah.  I'm sensitive.  Do you really feel it when you hear this?  I'll tell you the part I feel.  Ready?  And what do you feel? 
[03:16:30]  Wait.  Here we go.  When it kicks in.  That's when I'm walking through the airport now.  I get off the people mover.  Now I'm walking.  Oh, God.  You're pretty gay.  Now I'm walking.  This is Fergie, right?  Solo Fergie.  I've got to make my own choices, Opie.  I've got to straighten out my shit.  At the time, this is a blanket.  Count that down.  Yeah, I've got a good deal.  A good deal.  Hang on. 
[03:17:00]  Okay, I'll wait.  A good deal.  A good deal.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  I've got to hit.  All these lines in my face  is getting clearer.  Wow, D.O. doing this.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah, that's a great song.  Yeah, that's a great song.

[03:18:00]  It's Kim Wilde.  She was hot, but you have to do with an accent.  She was, yeah.  Right?  I sit here alone, and I was...  I sit here alone, and I was...  I sit here alone, and I was...  Yeah!  Now we're rocking.  Let's all pogo.  All right, I got everybody beat.  You ready?  Are you ready?  Uh-huh.  This is the gayest song ever.  No way.  Wow.  Hang on.  Hang on.

You can't beat that.  I might be able to.  There's no way.  Do we have what, what in the butt?  Remember what, what in the butt?  We did this bit already, Bobby.  Gayest song ever.  And I think we decided it was what, what in the butt.  By the way, this is pretty gay. 
[03:19:00]  Pretty gay.  Come on.  Here it comes.  I'm trying to...  When I was younger man.  That's not gay, though.  That's a good, that's a good song.  What is that?  What song is that?  I like that song.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Hitting the top.  Who does this?  Oh.  Climax Blues Band.  What's this?  It's called I Love You. 
[03:19:30]  Excuse me.  Danny just wrote, it smells like cum in here.  It does.  I'm serious.  Let me pull the cock out of Anthony's mouth and shove it in my asshole.  How about these guys?  Do you like these guys?  Hold on.  Sorry.  Who's going, Jimmy?  Here we go.  What the fuck?  Oh, come on.  Yeah.  Culture Club.  Can we play What What in the Butt for Bobby? 
[03:20:00]  You got that, Travis?  What What in the Butt?  I actually like that song.  Listen to What What in the Butt.  It's the most catchy song ever.  Listen to this.  I said What What in the Butt.  I said What What in the Butt.  I said What What in the Butt.  You want to do it in my butt, in my butt.  You want to do it in my butt, in my butt.  You want to do it in my butt, in my butt.  Let's do it in my butt.  Okay.  You know this song.  I love this song.  Of course you do.  He's playing it out of his iPod.  Actually.  You want to do it in my butt, in my butt. 
[03:20:30]  You want to do it in my butt, in my butt.  You want to do it in my butt, in my butt.  Let's do it in my butt.  Okay.  Bobby's singing along.  Wow.  That's pretty bad.  Who the fuck is this?  That's a great song.  Shall we dance? 
[03:21:00]  Planes and people.  I fucking hate this.  That's actually a good song.  You got one?  I got gayness in here, yeah.  Yeah, Love Song is the big Tesla song.  Thank you, Madden Queensberry.  I like this song.  This is a good song.  This is Frank Mir's fucking entrance music.  Should be Taps.  Hate Me Now?  You like rap, right? 
[03:21:30]  A little bit.  And they do.  This is called Hit Me Now?  Hate Me Now.  I'll hate Me Now.  It's a fucker.  You like rap.  Dude, you missed a great UFC.  Yeah.  You were up there in Boston for your what?  Your grandfather's 100?  Did he even know you were there?  Yeah.  Dude, my grandfather's very...  I mean, I hope I have his genes.  This motherfucker has got his shit.  What is he doing at 100 that everyone's impressed about?  Dude, he's fucking...  This is...  I asked him how it felt to be 100. 
[03:22:00]  Ready?  Papa, how's it feel to be 100?  Awful.  That's good.  Awful.  He just turned away.  He's got his shit together, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, and I think my grandmother's kind of bumming because she wanted to take care of him and...  But she's getting sick.  Oh, God.  Why?  What the hell is this?  What is this?  It's mine.  Jimmy.  What is it? 
[03:22:30]  The church at night can't find their way.  I want to marry a lighthouse keeper on that day or day.  Fuck it.  What?  Hold on.  It's not going to go through...  This is my favorite part.  I love living in a lighthouse.  How about you?  Holy shit.  How do you guys not recognize that?  How do you do, Joe?  Jimmy, you got this in front of you for Dana White?  I fucking love that. 
[03:23:00]  As these guys find more songs...  What is that?  Dana's looking for our help.  We were just talking about UFC a little bit.  Oh, the Time Magazine thing?  Yes.  I voted.  I did.  I did too, actually.  I voted for 100, even though he has fucking no clue who I am.  There's a poll in UAE.  He does know who you are.  We made it funny.  Again, we saw him backstage.  He knows about saying that to Frank.  He does know you, actually.  Dana is on timemagazine.com.  It's the top 100 most influential people.  And just idiotic Lady Gaga.  And this fucking...  And all the Koreans are voting for... 
[03:23:30]  You said Lady Gaga.  It's a good song.  It's a great song.  Don't correct me.  Okay.  I did agree with your fucking faggity music.  I agreed with you, you fucking idiot.  You're right.  I didn't correct you.  I would have said, no, it's not a great song.  It's a terrible song.  That's correcting.  Well, I don't acknowledge her while she competes with Dana.  That's right.  You know what?  I'm deleting the song off my fucking...  Do it right now, Bobby.  Timemagazine.com.  You can vote for the most influential.  I'm pushing for Dana just because he's a fucking...  He's a buddy, but it's also...  I think he's had a huge cultural influence. 
[03:24:00]  Timemagazine.com for the poll?  Yes.  Timemagazine.com.  Keep voting, guys.  Dana noticed that we helped him out.  It says thanks in very large part to O&A.  He's 89%.  I think he's 89% when you have to scroll that thing over to...  You know, at the top?  Is that how you vote, right?  Don't know.  At the top, you have to scroll some shit over and then vote.  He's like 89% or something like that.  How was the fucking UFC?  You didn't go, Anthony, did you?  It was amazing. 
[03:24:30]  No, I didn't go.  Why?  I had shit to do.  What?  Something that was more important than UFC.  Can I ask you what?  No.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Midnight Cowboy, this is in.  Is it?  I thought this was after Midnight Cowboy.  This is any scene in the 70s movie where they finally fall in love?  Oh, wait.  Oh, no shit.  I'm sorry.  That's a great song, dude. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  When does it kick in?  There it is.  You can hear the party.  Yeah.  This is like the music that Keith Robinson could actually sing.  Yeah.  Keith would dance in a sharkskin suit to this song.  Hey, was Lighthouse Keeper in Clockwork Orange, the soundtrack?  It absolutely was.  Wow.  Very good.  Are you shitting me?  That's the song he's listening to.  Very good.  His family, his mother and father, when they have Joe on the couch, when he comes back, 
[03:25:30]  he walks in and goes, hey, I'm all fit.  It's like, I want to marry a lighthouse.  That's the song he comes home to.  No kidding.  I didn't even know that.  And I've seen that movie.  I can't.  It's actually a different version in the movie.  This song, I listened to, honest to God, probably 19 times at the gym.  And I can't.  I don't know why.  This song.  I can't stop listening to it at the gym.  I don't think I know it.  It's one of my favorite songs. 
[03:26:00]  Oh, One?  Nope.  A version of One by U2 now?  Nope.  Nope.  Oh, not One.  But it's U2.  Nope.  What?  Sounds like, yeah.  That's not.  John Mayer?  John Mayer.  His new song.  That's a U2 riff in the background.  Is it?  Is he sampling?  No.  I can't fucking stop.  I just listen to it over and over again.  And what U2 song is in the background? 
[03:26:30]  Is it I Still Haven't Found?  Yeah, I think it's I Still Haven't Found.  That's the one I'm working for, right?  Yeah, you got hard metal, though, right?  This is good.  On your fucking thing.  I like it.  It's a great song.  Yeah, I do like it.  It's fucking one of my favorite songs.  It's pretty good, right?  No.  You don't like it, Tone?  Yeah, I like John Mayer.  What'd I call you, Tone?  Like we're fucking been friends since we were fucking 12.  Hey, Tone, you don't like it?  I want to hear some fucking... 
[03:27:00]  I want to hear you have metal death.  You got any fucking sick, crazy, heavy metal?  Yes.  What do you got?  I got one of my fucking favorite tunes of the last 10 years.  Hold on.  What is it?  I'll tell you.  I'll play it for you.  You tell me, and then we kiss.  Oh, shit.  I got this one.  You like this one.  You know what this one is, right?  You do.  I thought I did that one. 
[03:27:30]  No.  What?  Who's that?  It's Hedwig and the Angry Inch.  Go ahead.  You never heard of Hedwig and the Angry Inch?  One of my favorite new tunes.  Oh.  It's a little, uh, little Motorhead.  Oh, really?  Wait, sorry.  Here.  Motorhead. 
[03:28:00]  The opening song for the new fucking record.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Three guys, no livers.  If you don't like Motorhead, just fucking put a hose in your fucking car window.  Uh, U2's bad, people are saying.  U2's what?  Bad.  They don't like it?  No, the John Mayer song.  It has, like, kind of a U2 bad riff in the background.  Sort of.  What is that?  It's a good song.  All right, this one. 
[03:28:30]  Wolf Mother.  Here it comes.  Come on, come on.  Where is it?  Gotta go around again.  Oh.  I got this.  This band is fucking badass.  This is the band that was on, uh, Torgasm.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wolf Mother.  That's great.  Yeah.  Wolf Mother was fucking great. 
[03:29:00]  I fucking loved that first album.  That's fucking great.  It's a bunch of fucking penguins.  Because you know why it's good?  Because it's like old fucking rock and roll.  It took 20 minutes to get to the lyrics.  Yeah, exactly.  It was just fucking guitars, bass, drum.  Everybody did a little fucking crazy shit.  And then when they were done with that, it was like, all right, sing, fucking pussy.  Yeah. 
[03:29:30]  I'm done fucking doing my guitar shit.  It's just a giant intro.  What about these guys?  Holy shit.  You like these guys, right?  Yeah.  You like songs with dirty words in them. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah, Bob makes Bob feel cool.  Here we go.  Here we go.  It makes them feel cool.  That's a good song.  I like them.  They're fucking good.  Right on.  Y'all crazy, man.  All right, let's take a break and we'll wrap up the show next with Robert Kelly.  Robertkellylive.com to see him do his comedy thing, right?  Yep.  You'll take us to break with this?  Yeah.  This is another gay song.  Alice Smith.  Sounds like you're as cold as ice. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah.  No, it doesn't.  In the morning.  Ah.  Like to see you sleeping by the side.  Jesus Christ.  Ah.  What the fuck, man?  Wait, here it goes.  More.  Bob Kelly.  Robertkellylive.com.  Go check out my dates.  Twitter.  Facebook.  Weeek.  We could be forever happy through rain. 
[03:31:00]  We're back.  We're back.  We've been away for a long, long, long, long time.  We've been through changes.  We've played some games.  The more things change, the more things stay the same.  We're a little bit older, but we've got a glider.  We're back.  We're better than ever. 
[03:31:30]  We're back.  We're back.  Together forever.  We're back.  We're back.  We're better than ever.  We're back.  We're back.  Together forever.  We're back.  Very good.  We're back.  I like it.  Yeah, and you knew that they would try to put funny lyrics in, like, and he would, like, the video would be, like, we're back. 
[03:32:00]  And it'd be David Lee Roth and Eddie Van Halen back-to-back looking at each other.  And he would do his douchey, like, we're a little bit older, but we ain't much wise.  Dumb David Lee Roth laugh.  Oh, God, that's so embarrassing.  Yeah.  I love it.  David Lee Roth.  Yeah.  The more things change, the more they stay the same.  But then they'd go to Wolfgang because he's the new guy playing bass.  Oh, that'd be, like, that new tune.  It'd be fucking awful.  I have fucking goose bumpy douche chills. 
[03:32:30]  I thought a little bit older but a little bit wiser might be actually a song.  Like, we're a little bit older, but we ain't much wiser.  I have a terrible David Lee Roth's fucking solo album.  Ugh.  Oh, Edom and Smile.  Yankee Rottles.  Yeah.  Well, let me roll up onto the sidewalk and take a look.  Whoa.  She's beautiful.  Oh.  Wow.  I'm talking about a Yankee Rose. 
[03:33:00]  Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.  Oh, God.  She looks wild.  It's wild.  Wild.  Wild.  Are you ready for the new sensation?  No, I'm not.  You just don't like them, huh?  The new sensation?  You ever hear Damn Good?  David Lee Roth?  Never.  Solo song?  He's never written anything that was that.  I like fucking this.  You got damn good, Travis.  Cut out of his pants.  He was a great fucking front man. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah, he was.  This is David Lee Roth getting emotional.  You want to hear it?  Yeah.  You got it, Travis?  I remember this song.  This was a hit on the home of rock and roll, 96 WCMF Rochester.  Wow.  One of the many homes of rock and roll.  We played the shit out of this one.  This is a solo?  Yeah. 
[03:34:00]  Self-indulgent guitar shit.  This is when you would air guitar, too, on a wiffle ball bat?  Yeah, man.  You wouldn't?  The guitar playing is pretty cool, though, no?  Oh, yeah.  The first hour.  Well, it was another time where you didn't have to get right to the vocals.  Yeah, that's why I like that song of music.  Here we go.  David Lee Roth.  Not quite.  Sorry.  I'm going to go through this riff again. 
[03:34:30]  Time rolls on.  That's as it should be.  I was actually trying to sing and not talk his way through a song.  This is not that bad.  Seems to move so quickly.  Man, we was happy in our restless hearts. 
[03:35:00]  It was heaven.  It's all right.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  Whatever.  A little taste.  David Lee Roth trying to sing.  A little taste.  Huh?  I need Tums.  Taste.  Chris from Boston.  Hey, yo.  Before Brad Delp died, he recorded a song called Rockin' Away. 
[03:35:30]  And it's exactly like Jimmy's version of We're Back.  Rockin'.  Anytime Rockin'.  It has all the titles and references to other Boston songs.  Do we have that?  Dude, anytime Rockin' is spelled R-O-C-K-I-N, it's going to be a terrible fucking song.  Rockin'.  You know what I just found in my drawer?  It's a belt buckle that says Rock in Diamonds.  Wow.  You know why I had to stop wearing it?  Because I got too fat and the R kept sticking into my gut and cutting my stomach open. 
[03:36:00]  Oh, fuck.  That's classic.  Shit.  We were talking about the other night, Keith Robinson got fucking bumped.  We were trashing him the other night.  What did he get bumped by?  He got bumped by the chick who won Last Comic Standing, Eliza.  What's her name?  Eliza Dushku?  No, that's the fucking chick.  That's the actress.  Eliza Schlesinger.  Schlesinger.  She's a comedian.  Yeah, I know her.  Fucking Keith was at the Improv in L.A. and he hasn't been on stage for a while. 
[03:36:30]  She was kind of getting geared up.  He's going on.  She's gearing up, kind of pacing.  All right, I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  All right.  Hold on.  No one gives a shit about your story.  Brad, tribute video.  What do you mean nobody gives a shit?  I was enjoying that.  Yeah.  Keith being humiliated?  Yeah.  What's better than that?  What happened?  He was bumped by a fucking girl who won Last Comic Standing.  I'm sorry.  Now nobody gives a shit about you.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Keith has had this 30 years and he's being humiliated publicly. 
[03:37:00]  Dude, he got bumped by...  They came in and just said...  They went, yeah, Eliza's here.  And he's like, what the fuck does that mean?  And they said, she's going on.  She has to be somewhere.  He starts flipping out.  What the fuck?  He goes, do you want to talk to a manager?  And he goes, yeah, where's the manager?  And he went to talk to the manager and when he did, they just slipped her on.  That's pretty funny.  But I was telling him, I got fucking bumped on Thanksgiving.  I was doing...  Dane was like, dude, I go on Thanksgiving. 
[03:37:30]  I help feed the homeless every year down the Laugh Factory.  You should come.  I was like, all right, I'll go down.  I go in.  First of all, Dane does white meat.  That's all he does.  He doesn't do anything else.  He's white meat only.  Why?  I don't know.  He's just white meat in the center.  White meat.  I'm on potatoes.  20 minutes in, I get a fucking tap on the shoulder.  The guy just gives me the thumb sign.  Beat it.  I go, what?  He goes, get out.  Fucking Arsenio Hall bumped me out of fucking potatoes.  He goes, Arsenio wants potatoes. 
[03:38:00]  And they fucking bumped me out of fucking potatoes.  I'm just standing there.  Then he yells at me.  You can't stand there.  I go, what the fuck am I supposed to do?  Who was running this?  Trying to be a nice guy.  Who was running this?  Some fucking dude with an afro and a jerry coat.  Oh, we found the Brad Delp song.  Let's hear.  Who's Brad?  He's the guy from Boston that died.  And then he had a song called Rockin' Away that references a lot of Boston songs.  So when Brad Delp died, somebody made a tribute video with his song Rockin' Away, which no 
[03:38:30]  one heard because no one, well, that's the reason probably he killed himself because  no one gave a shit about his Rockin' Away song.  Put a barbecue in his bedroom and fucking sealed the door up and went to sleep.  The lead singer to Boston did?  Yeah, a few years back.  He was a great guy until we met him over the years.  But they're saying it's just like Jimmy's We're Back song.  So that's why we're playing this.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  It was born a singer. 
[03:39:00]  It wasn't something I planned.  All I ever wanted was to be what I am.  I was just 13 years old.  I heard a record that stopped me cold.  I bought a Sears guitar and I started to jam.  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  Nothing can be any better 
[03:39:30]  It's like Mankind right there.  I see that.  Young Mankind, right?  It did look like him.  The chorus is cheesy, but it's not that bad.  It's not that bad.  But the chorus is a little cheesy.  Just me and my room with a free...  Just me and my kings for charcoal.  Just me and my kings for charcoal.  Oh, that's funny. 
[03:40:00]  This is the hibachi anthem.  I grew up in the 60s.  67 was the summer of love.  Those were times when the music had something to say.  Steven S. has changed the name of the song to Rotten Away.  Oh, shit.  Yeah. 
[03:40:30]  Ah, see?  We're doing the Boston song.  I thought we were well on our way  Well on our way  Hey, I remember we all got together  Yeah, I like this.  I do, too.  Fuck me.  You gotta go buy it now.  I like this.  I mean, it's enough.  It's not great, but it's catchy. 
[03:41:00]  He aged in like a week.  No kidding.  You see that?  Holy shit.  It's on YouTube.  Brad Delp tribute video rocked away.  He was having some problems with the drugs.  Is that why he killed himself?  Yeah, he was having some problems with the drugs and depression and shit.  And he literally put a hibachi in his room?  Yeah.  They speculate he wasn't having a barbecue because of a note.  Yeah, it's the suicide note. 
[03:41:30]  There were no burgers and there was a note.  It wasn't a recipe.  Yeah, exactly.  At least he was nice enough to warn everyone else that there's a problem behind the door,  by the way.  He left the note.  When you find me, please turn me over and baste me.  Yeah, exactly.  Please don't let the salmon burn.  Sincerely, your dead friend, slash relative.  Yeah.  In the suicide note, he said, I can't take having a last name that sounds like an anal polyp. 
[03:42:00]  That is what a Delp sounds like.  You have to have a cluster of Delps taken off your colon.  You have a few Delps in here.  Yeah.  Do you know what that is?  That's a mealy substance under the crown of your cock.  If you have Delp.  Mealy.  Yeah.  It's like a mealy cheesy, like, wart-like substance under your dick crown.  That's horrible.  Exactly.  Dick crown.  Nobody eats Delp sandwiches anymore.  Ah, God. 
[03:42:30]  Breaking news.  David Schuster suspended from MSNBC.  Do we know why?  Is that real?  I wonder what he said that was inappropriate, that Obermann will grovel and apologize and  not back him up for it.  Yeah.  Is that true?  Schuster suspended for what?  Let's see.  Indefinitely.  Uh-oh.  That means gone.  That means, let's see who else is involved.  This might be more exciting if it was the result of abysmal ratings or embarrassment over  journalistic bankruptcy. 
[03:43:00]  As it is, MSNBC has apparently suspended David Schuster indefinitely for disloyalty.  Oh, I know the story.  He made a pilot for CNN.  Oh.  And they found out about it.  Oh, okay.  So CNN was interested in something, so he made a pilot for CNN and it got back to the  MSNBC.  So he might be jumping ship.  So that's the loyalty thing.  Like, you know what?  Fuck you.  Then he might get a gig at CNN.  They might make it easy for him to go to CNN.  Which isn't much better than MSNBC at this point in the ratings. 
[03:43:30]  True.  Larry King getting his ass kicked.  Fox is just wiping everybody up.  They are fucking killing every other news outlet.  It's amazing how when you talk to people, they're like, oh, Fox is so terrible.  But it's like, no one's making people watch it.  I know.  Yeah.  Fucking assholes.  You can watch any fucking channel you want.  Exactly.  You can watch, you know, the fucking logo of your aunt.  Logo?  I watch a little gay channel.  I watch the outdoor channel.  Do you?  Yeah.  Why?  It's called a fucking window. 
[03:44:00]  Why don't you go outdoors instead of watching the outdoor channel?  I watch the channel.  It's called the foyer.  What's on the outdoor channel?  The hunt bucks.  Oh, is that what they do?  Hunt.  White tail.  I don't like watching animals.  They bow hunt.  You know what?  Can I say something?  I really don't anymore either.  I don't like watching.  I thought I would.  I used to like that hunting ship.  And now I watch it.  And I just flabbergasted.  Well, they hold the fucking head up.  And they're moving it around.  And the thing's just wide eyed.  It's dead. 
[03:44:30]  And it's like, what the fuck?  I was just eating some grass and shit.  Trying to have a good time out here with myself.  Just kill me.  And now they got hot chicks in it now, though.  Hunting.  Do they?  Yeah.  It's like, I can't watch girl MMA on Showtime.  I don't know why you got a boner.  Dude, I can't watch it.  Do you see that fight they had last week with the chicks?  They wear the tight shorts now.  And you can see like the outline of exactly what their pussy looks like while they're fucking  fighting each other.  That's kind of hot.  Oh, they're just squatting down.  Their assholes are spread open. 
[03:45:00]  And they're fucking trying to break each other's arms and fucking eat each other's pussies at  the same time.  Sounds nice.  Dude, I can't fucking do it.  Now, this is just...  What are we going to watch him get his head blown off?  Look at the nice deer.  Yeah, dude.  Look at the deer.  Just standing there.  Just looking up like, hey, I think something's going on up there.  Is he here to pet us?  I think something's going on.  They're wagging their little white tails.  Watch.  They get hit, though.  And they're like, what the fuck?  And then they run.  And then they realize they're dead.  Yeah, they do run.  They don't even know. 
[03:45:30]  There's nothing going on.  Here we go.  Watch.  What?  How close are you going to let these motherfuckers get them on the head with a ball peen hammer?  Exactly.  These deer are dopes.  They think the gun is a treat dispenser.  I'll tell you.  Fucking assholes are walking over there with their mouths open hoping for a salt treat.  A treat dispenser.  Fucking idiots.  You know what is funny?  Look at these.  He's looking right at the gun.  Yeah, exactly.  He thinks it's a fucking periscope.  Oh, maybe I can see other things to eat by looking through this. 
[03:46:00]  What a retard.  The fucking deer has down syndrome.  He's walking towards the gun.  Here we go.  He's so dead.  He's just staring right into the view of the gun.  Yeah, he's playing chicken and about to lose badly.  Look at the...  There's nothing going on.  No, you think...  Watch.  There we go.  There's nothing going on.  They're just looking at the deer.  They're all looking at all the deer seeing.  Ow!  Oh, fuck.  Fucking dead.  You know what?  What a shot.  Look at this.  Other one's like, what the fuck?  The other one doesn't even run.  The other one hasn't moved.  And then there's the fucking...  He nailed that fucker right in the goddamn chair. 
[03:46:30]  Where did he get him?  Where did he hit him?  Right in the fucking head.  Where was the kill shot?  It wasn't in the head.  It wasn't in the head.  Oh!  That deer didn't interfere anything, though.  I'll say that.  How do you know?  That thing was still alive.  It's still lying there.  It's a heart shot.  Look at this other one.  Can I say the other deer just looked?  Dude, watch it.  The other deer just went, hey, why did he fall down?  You know what is funny, though?  Watching turkeys get killed.  That kind of makes me laugh.  Then the other turkeys try to fuck it. 
[03:47:00]  I'm not kidding.  They're trying to bond with the murderers.  Yeah.  We didn't like him either.  Thanks for doing us a favor.  I fucking love turkeys getting shot with a shotgun.  Oh, God, Bobby.  That's funny.  Man, that deer did not fucking budge after he got hit, by the way.  That was a hell of a shot.  Well, it's time to go home.  Is that it?  Yeah, 10 for us.  There we go.  Oh, some people show up so late.  My goodness.  Well, Bobby, robertkellylive.com. 
[03:47:30]  But you're going to West Des Moines, Iowa.  Then you're going to Cleveland.  And then you've got the big Boston show.  Yeah, coming up, man.  All the dates on robertkellylive.com.  Or robertkellylive.com.  Robert Kelly fans on Twitter.  Yeah, I tried to change it.  To what?  I went to the Twitter offices.  Oh, yeah, you did.  Were they cool?  Yeah, this kid, Sean, is a big fan of you guys, actually.  Knows me from this show.  And what does he do for Twitter?  He works in the international department with another Japanese gentleman. 
[03:48:00]  I went over and visited him.  Fucking what a great setup over there.  Yeah.  Catered lunch every day.  If you're Twitter, of course.  All open setting.  Like, literally, there's no big main office for the main guy.  Like, they're on the floor next day.  Well, what do they do?  No phones.  They just send each other tweets.  We're doing all the work for them.  What do they do?  Exactly.  What the fuck do they do, Bobby?  I don't know.  What do they do?  I didn't ask that guy.  What do the offices do? 
[03:48:30]  Really?  You know what?  There's a lot of people.  You were there.  Did you ask anyone?  I asked them about 141.  Maybe they're just all making believe they do something.  I asked them a lot of questions.  I had a lot of questions asked.  Why didn't you just get Robert Kelly?  I can't get Robert Kelly's taken.  By who?  By Robert Kelly.  What does he do, though?  Why is he so important?  Are you a bigger Robert Kelly?  I hope he's a penarist.  He should go to the biggest Robert Kelly.  I know.  I should, right?  He won't fucking give it to me.  You asked him?  Yeah.  How many followers does he have?  I'll tell you right now. 
[03:49:00]  You want to know?  What did he say?  He said no.  We're running out of show, though, for real, because we didn't take as many breaks today.  I met the CEO.  I mean, the owner of the company.  What is he?  He's a regular guy?  Who?  Robert Kelly.  Yeah, what is he?  I don't know.  That's a good question.  Go look at his Twitter.  You never looked at his site.  There's Robert Kelly.  How many followers does this?  Who's listening to him?  Let me see him.  This is going to hurt Bobby so bad.  He's got 82 followers.  He's got 82 followers.  Can everybody go to Robert Kelly and tell him to fucking give me my name back, please?  Give him the name.  What does he have?  82 followers?  And who has Jim Norton at Gmail? 
[03:49:30]  I want that email address.  I want Robert Kelly.  What does this guy do, Robert Kelly?  Exactly.  Can I see the photo?  He's a geek football fan and all-around nice guy.  He's not nice enough.  If he's a nice guy, he would give me that fucking name.  All-around nice guy.  All-around nice guy.  You don't like that?  Don't make him mad, Jim, because I want to get my name first.  No, he's an all-around nice guy.  Everybody should tweet what a nice guy he is.  He'd be like, well, I got some app mentions.  That'd be funny.  Just everybody hit his Twitter today. 
[03:50:00]  Just pound him.  Yeah.  Oh, I guess he's from the UK.  Oh.  Limey best.  Exactly.  He's a geek, though.  He probably could fucking hack into my me account.  It might as well be your Twitter.  Here's a tweet.  Just had pizza for dinner.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, I'm sorry.  What's your tweet?  What's your amazing genius tweet?  Can I just have a joke?  Oh, yeah.  That's a good point, Bob.  That's true.  You're right.  You're right.  Just take one.  You fucking took a lot of shots today.  You can't take one back.  What the fuck?  What the fuck's the matter with you?  You're absolutely right.  I apologize. 
[03:50:30]  Do it again, Danny.  Danny's saying it's entertaining.  Do it again, Danny.  Try it again.  Just try it again.  Action.  Go.  Pick it over.  Come on, Danny.  Go.  Ready?  Here we go.  Ah, this fucking guy.  What an asshole.  What a fucking guy.  He's probably a fucking guy.  Go.  Do it.  I'll do it.  All right, you go.  Hey, fucking.  What the fuck?  This guy.  Twitter might as well be yours.  It's shit.  I don't know.  He punched it up.  All right.  Yeah, he didn't.  We really got to go for Ron.  Yeah, let's get out of here.  See you tomorrow.  Yeah, let's just say it later, everybody. 
[03:51:00]  See you tomorrow.  I said what, what in the butt.  I said what, what in the butt.  Do it in my butt.  In my butt.  You want to do it in my butt.  In my butt.  You want to do it in my butt.  In my butt.  Do it in my butt.  Okay.  Do it in my butt.  In my butt.  You want to do it in my butt.  In my butt.  You want to do it in my butt.  In my butt.  Do it in my butt.  Okay.  We'll be right back. 
[03:51:30]  We'll be right back.
