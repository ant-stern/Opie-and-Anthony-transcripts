<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a bombastic intro highlighting its controversial reputation, immediately followed by a bizarre anecdote involving a paddle, skin discoloration, and a physical altercation featuring someone named Rowan and Dave.  The hosts then transitioned to more mundane topics: the weather, their delayed heating systems, and the hypocrisy of New York City's "going green" initiatives, citing energy waste despite environmental campaigns, specifically referencing the excessive energy consumption of Times Square's New Year's Eve ball drop. Opie's illness and resulting sleeplessness led to a brief discussion about sore throats before returning to the critique of "going green," dismissing it as a marketing ploy.  The conversation veered into the rising price of oil, China's role in it, and a cynical assessment of the US's reliance on war to boost the economy.

The hosts engaged in playful insults directed at each other and their staff (Gregorio, Antonio, Mimi), before satirizing a candlelight vigil for a tiger that killed a teenager, suggesting the zoo should have kept the tiger alive as a money-making attraction. The discussion then shifted to the general public's lack of understanding of the US election process, specifically the intricacies of primaries, caucuses, and the electoral college. They expressed cynicism about the upcoming Iowa caucus and presidential elections, referencing Chris Rock's comedic observations about the voting process.  They briefly discussed Led Zeppelin's Bonnaroo performance and Opie's potential attendance, followed by a poorly executed musical interlude of a distorted "Stairway to Heaven."  A "Biggest Gainer" contest, parodying "The Biggest Loser," was announced, featuring staff members like Butcher (described as having a deceptive physique), Pat Duffy, and Lily (from the Ron and Fez show), along with Travis, who expressed disbelief at his ability to gain weight.  The segment concluded with further cynical commentary on the presidential election, focusing on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and a discussion about the physical appearances of past presidents.  A mention was made of a previous segment on Dick Clark, but it was not replayed due to time constraints.

The next segment opened with a humorous discussion of a minivan crashing into an ABC News studio in Chicago during a live broadcast.  This transitioned into a story about an adopted son unknowingly working with his birth mother at Lowe's for eight months.  The hosts and callers reacted with shock, humor, and cynicism, debating the son's potential reactions and the mother's perceived irresponsibility. Matt from Boston shared his own experience of reuniting with his birth mother. The conversation then returned to the hosts' illnesses, followed by a lengthy and offensive discussion of a news story about a program using smell therapy to cure sex offenders.  The segment included audio clips from the news report and extensive, vulgar jokes about the program and sex offenders.  A Paul R. Nelson political advertisement criticizing the opponent's alleged spending of taxpayer money on sexual studies was also played and discussed. The segment concluded with discussions of censorship of their show and the playing of a vulgar song, "The Song of the Count."

A story recounted by Travis about a parking lot altercation at Ikea dominated the following segment. His wife's confrontation with another driver escalated into a hostile exchange, which Travis attempted to de-escalate.  The hosts and callers extensively discussed the incident, debating the appropriate responses to aggression, gender roles in conflict, and individual interpretations of the events. Jimmy shared a similar story involving a pizza delivery driver, with Travis's wife, Lisa, also contributing to the conversation. The discussion was heavily laced with profanity and vulgar language.

The final segment focused on the Writers Guild of America strike. The hosts discussed the strike's impact on writers, network executives, and other television production staff. Louie C.K. appeared as a guest, expressing mixed feelings about the strike and highlighting the hardships faced by non-writing crew members lacking residuals.  He shared a personal anecdote about a residual check that "saved Christmas," contrasting his experience with those less fortunate. The conversation included speculation about which parties were most negatively impacted, with the crew being identified as the hardest hit. The segment also included the show's regular "line of the day" segment featuring crude jokes, a discussion of Conan O'Brien's new beard, and concluded with another humorous, sexually explicit song about "the Count".  Mike DeStefano called in, offering his perspective on the Ikea altercation, and Jimmy Norton was present in studio throughout this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Shocks, Opie and Anthony.  What happened to your socks?  I don't know what happened.  Oh my God. Oh my God.  Yes, man.  Do it now. His skin is completely black.  Oh my God.  This is where entertainment is going.  Oh my God.  Oh, Rowan's got a paddle.  Oh my God. 
[00:01:00]  Rowan is kicking Dave's ass.  Who saw this?  They are sick freaks.  One, two, three.  Go.  B-Rock is attempting.  Give us a thumbs up if you're all right.  Shut up.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Good morning.  That would imply that you actually slept.  I have to, uh...  I have to get rid of me gum.  Why?  Because it's bad to broadcast with gum in your mouth.  You know?  I'm just happy to see that you decided to take your winter coat off today.  It was a little warm in here. 
[00:02:00]  In the office?  Not so much.  Not so much, right?  But outside?  Brutal!  But...  Come on, we've been lucky.  You know what?  I turned on the heat for the first time yesterday.  Really?  I think I'm the last guy.  The last guy to turn his heat on, finally.  Ran out of Java logs.  No.  No.  When you live in a building, you get everyone else's heat.  Yeah, that's true.  What a nice luxury.  Heat rises, I hear.  Although it's not that nice when people decide they need heat in September and early October 
[00:02:30]  when it's still really nice outside.  So you're just baking in your apartment because some other idiot's cold in September.  Then what do you do?  Open your windows and let the heat go out?  Oh, yeah.  New York's going green.  Oh, yeah.  And it's just like heat is flying out into the environment.  Screw it.  $100 a barrel for oil now.  I was listening to the show yesterday, and we didn't do the whole going green thing  justice.  No.  We might have to focus on that a little more today. 
[00:03:00]  We'll have to revisit.  Because you're right.  Because actually, I had the heat on yesterday for the first time, but the windows wide open  in the bedroom because it gets too hot in there.  So you know the heat's just flying out of the apartment.  And then I'm laying in bed last night.  I couldn't sleep whatsoever because someone got me sick.  And I'll tell you right now, if we didn't take all those days off, there's no way I  would be here today.  I got my classic sore throat.  I get like every time.  Ooh, that one. 
[00:03:30]  Every, every, every, yeah.  This time every year, I should say.  But I'm laying in bed with this scratchy throat doing the gulp gulps.  Is that the worst or what?  That's the prelude.  You know it's coming.  You're like, why am I swallowing so much?  Oh, boy.  And it's like, if I can only get this glob of what seems to be mucus down my throat.  But it's not.  It's just the back of your throat swelling up.  You spend the whole night waking up going, wow, I was really in deep sleep there.  Why am I awake? 
[00:04:00]  And then all of a sudden you realize because you're gulping and your throat is dry and nothing  will soothe it so you can go back to sleep.  And then you get so exhausted, you fall asleep again for maybe 20 to 30 minutes and you wake  up again.  Yeah.  That was my night last night.  But I'm looking out the window because of that bit we did about going green yesterday.  And sure enough, man, all of Midtown is just lit.  Lit up.  Lit up.  Heat blowing out the open windows because people are a little warm.  I'm like, boy, a lot of people are working some OT at four in the morning. 
[00:04:30]  No, they're not.  We just don't care.  I stay in a hotel every so often when we've got stuff to do here in Manhattan.  And right across from it is a huge office building.  And it does not matter what time I wake up or go to sleep or hanging out in the hotel.  Three in the morning, I could look over at that office building.  And you know no one's working.  Yeah.  Every light is on in the building.  Every floor is lit up.  You look over there.  You'll see maybe one of the people cleaning, a cleaning person in one room. 
[00:05:00]  And the entire building's lit up.  We're going green.  And we were laughing yesterday because the whole story about the ball that drops, the big crystal  ball that drops for New Year's Eve, was a green this year and only used the power of 10 toasters.  Ooh.  Wow.  Thank you.  And in the meantime, Times Square was lit up using enough power to power India for 80 billion years. 
[00:05:30]  Right, right.  There you go.  You know how much energy that ball drop thing saved?  Oh.  I'll show you.  Okay.  How much?  You just shut our mics off for two seconds.  Not even.  For a split second.  You went green right there.  That was good.  Thank you.  Look at me.  We're going green.  There it is.  Helping environment.  I just went green.  I improved the standard of radio in New York very briefly. 
[00:06:00]  It is a joke.  It's just a joke.  It's not real.  People are buying into it.  It's another sales ploy.  It's a catchphrase.  It's a selling point.  Right.  People think they're doing something.  It makes them feel less guilty.  It makes them feel like they're saving money.  That's another thing.  Ooh, we'll go green and we'll do this.  Shut up. 
[00:06:30]  It's not helping.  Until, like Ope says, until you can look out over Manhattan and have it look like it did in 1860 every night.  Yeah, that would be nice.  A couple of campfires in the street.  Yeah, of course.  You're not helping.  Well, America's very competitive, too.  We're sitting here thinking, why let the Chinese have all the energy?  Apparently, they're getting all of it, though.  I understand.  Wow, are they screwing us over?  Until they start turning off a few lights, we're going to be business as usual.  Yeah.  And what the hell happened over the past few years that China has decided, as a nation, that they need to use a lot of oil and push the price up to $100 a barrel now? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Wasn't it just like 50 and change?  We just hit $100 for the first time, right?  Yeah.  Oil hits $100 a barrel for the first time.  But they're calling for like $100 and a quarter in no time and saying, these are just the prices we're going to be stuck with.  And they say it's comparable to the early 80s prices if you put in inflation, but I don't know about that. 
[00:07:30]  It was just $50-something a barrel.  And they keep going, will it go to $60?  Will it go to $70?  Right.  And then I hear $100.  I thought it was a war for oil.  Man!  Man!  That old gag.  Man!  It's oil, man!  I thought we were fighting for oil.  We're going to like exploit the country and take their oil so we could have our big cars and drive around. 
[00:08:00]  Shut up, you college puke.  $100 a barrel.  Look, the reality is.  Oh boy, I said that.  That's one of my crushes.  But America needs to fight wars.  Yeah.  That's what we do.  That's what we do to help the economy.  It's one of our best exports.  Our soldiers willing to kill.  We need a war every, what, 10 years?  Yeah.  10, 15, yeah.  And a few flare-ups in between.  Yeah.  For lobbing a few cruise missiles to keep everyone interested. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, but in general, we like war in America, and it really does some fine things to the economy.  Well, it helps out, yeah, the economy.  Everyone is working because they've got to build stuff.  Right.  Stuff gets broken in wars, apparently, and you've got to repair it or make new ones.  Right, exactly.  So there you go.  That's your economic news.  Oh, I know.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, my freaking throat is just scratchy and dry. 
[00:09:00]  Jim, zipper, help me.  Oh, I'd be happy to.  Ew.  Give him a wash.  Why are you calling him?  A throat wash.  Why are you calling him Jim?  Oh.  Jimmy.  Freaking Jimmy Trumped me yesterday.  I hate you.  But I didn't.  You just said, what's your name?  I spent two days over break making my girl call me Gregorio.  Gregorio.  I would walk into the living room and go, for the next two days, I want to be referred 
[00:09:30]  to as Gregorio.  And then we gave Anthony his Antonio yesterday.  Yeah.  And then we went to Jimmy and went, Jimmy, what's your name?  And you came up with.  Mimi.  See, the J is sounds like a Y.  It's kind of silent.  We're trying to get, I guess, some urban listeners.  Yeah.  Numbers.  Seems to be doing well for some other radio stations in New York.  So, for now on, Gregorio.  Antonio.  Mimi.  The comic relief. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  You can wear a big frilly red velvet shirt.  I slink in like Marty Feldman and throw out a joke or two.  Yeah.  That's good for the urban audience.  A Marty Feldman reference.  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  He's been dead for 30 years.  Something we were laughing at just before we went on the air, by the way.  We should hit the people with this one.  Candlelight vigil held for the tiger who killed Teen in San Francisco.  And we applaud the people standing around with their candles for the tiger. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, this is for the tiger, not for the person that was killed and the two people that were  maimed by the mauling of this tiger.  In San Francisco, I hope everyone knows the story by now.  It's one of those stories that is just terrific.  It's not terrific, though, that they had to kill the stupid tiger.  No.  They showed the video of that today, of the tiger just dead on the side.  Poor guy.  Well, he was just doing what tigers are supposed to do, especially if you taunt them.  Because now it's coming out that the guys might have had a slingshot, slingshots, and they 
[00:11:00]  might have been doing some things to the tiger.  And the tiger's been sitting there looking at that freaking wall for a while.  And he's been sizing up that wall like Anthony was telling me.  Oh, you know it.  The tigers know, and any cat really knows what it can do and can't do.  It knows its parameters, knows its environment.  And you know that tiger was looking at that wall going, I can make that.  But why would I want to when they throw, like, steaks at me every night? 
[00:11:30]  Right.  This is wonderful.  Until someone shoots him in the face with a slingshot, then I go, you know something?  I can make this wall.  And that guy probably a little tastier than a steak.  Sure.  And he jumped over the wall and just mauled him.  Yeah.  And now stories are coming out from the two injured guys that they went to get help.  And the zoo employees didn't believe him, didn't care.  They went to a little cafe in the middle of this zoo and were screaming that they needed 
[00:12:00]  help.  And someone's like, we're closed.  We're closed.  And then walked up to a security guard and said, there's a tiger mauling my friends.  And the security guard went, yeah, right.  Yeah, right.  Just a visual of that.  You're frantic, freaking out.  You're a freaking buddy.  He's just being mauled.  He's probably losing his ball back as you speak.  Yeah.  He's ripping it off. 
[00:12:30]  And they don't believe you.  No.  We're closed.  No, there's a tiger.  We're closed.  I don't understand why they have to kill the animal after us stupid humans go and taunt  like these creatures at a zoo.  And every once in a while, you know, the animal fights back.  You've seen the video of what was it?  The polar bear with the kid pinned up against the bars.  Yeah, it's ripping its coat off.  And then all of a sudden, they kill the polar bear. 
[00:13:00]  Why?  Or whatever that animal was.  It was some kind of a bear.  I don't get it.  Only way to get it to stop, probably.  Like, if it's misbehaving, there's no way to get it back in.  It's just, it's...  No, I think it's after they free the kid and all.  And then they decide, you know, this thing is misbehaving.  We got to kill it.  Yeah.  I mean, this tiger that mauled this kid in San Francisco, if I was a zoo, I would put  that on display.  You want to...  Yeah, here it is.  You want to see the killer tiger.  You want an attraction.  P.T. Barnum understood that crap. 
[00:13:30]  Man-eating tiger.  You want a killer tiger.  That's an attraction now.  You don't kill the damn thing.  You would see ticket sales go through the roof.  Yeah.  Come see it.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Get close, but not too close.  So the animal rights activists held a vigil for the tiger, right?  Yeah, and I, again, they are...  I applaud that, actually.  I mean, when you listen to them talk, they're like, ugh.  Well, the talking is ridiculous, right?  Mm-hmm.  Of course.  You know, humans failed Tatiana. 
[00:14:00]  Tatiana.  Did they?  What else did they do?  Don't we just ruin everything?  You're not used to that already?  They're actually taking...  They took care of the animal, because if he was still living in its home area there...  Of course.  Or some native would have shot it and used its foot to make some kind of an awful powder  to make paint out of it.  What do you think?  The natives are nice to tigers?  They just shovel out its gallbladder and use it for some kind of aphrodisiac.  Dumb dance. 
[00:14:30]  Circles.  Meaningless idiocy.  With a tiger head on a stick.  Yeah.  They put it on top of its own head.  Oh, look.  I'm a tiger.  Yeah.  No, you're not.  We can see your head.  I love it.  I love when they do documentaries on little tribes.  And they're like...  And the Kunga Wunga people.  It's like, why don't you just point out and go, would you look at these idiots?  Yeah.  Would you look at these retards who think it's okay to run in a circle with no shoes on?  Put some shoes on, for God's sake.  So, in other news, we got that.  We got the Iowa caucus today. 
[00:15:00]  Who did that?  Does anyone...  I hear even the people in Iowa are just like, we don't care.  Get out.  Well, I'm sure, yeah.  I'm sure most of the people you're right don't give a crap.  Yeah.  These people are coming to their town.  You know, I was reading the post today, and Chris Rock played the garden.  He was in here promoting the garden.  Yeah.  Gig, it was sold out, and he just killed.  Everyone loved it.  And they wrote down some of the jokes he had in the paper today, and a lot of his observations. 
[00:15:30]  And one of his observations is simple.  He says, boy, they really don't want us to vote for president, do they?  They make it really hard for us to vote for the presidency, but we could vote for dancing with the stars.  That's good.  So true.  You got a funny point about...  So true.  I mean, they get, what, more votes for the American Idol contestants than the president?  For any election.  For any election.  Yeah, it's...  That's on purpose, people.  We know that, right?  People... 
[00:16:00]  Most people know that by now.  99% of the people in this country do not understand the true election process.  They don't understand things as simple as, you know, the primaries.  Right.  And the caucuses.  People don't get it.  And even on election day, they think they're actually casting an individual vote for a candidate, and they're really not.  It just doesn't work that way.  But, eh, keep them all fat and stupid.  That's the best way. 
[00:16:30]  Right.  Well, for example, if you are a Republican in New York, you're not going to get a Republican president.  Don't wake up.  Don't wake up.  It doesn't matter.  Well, you might get a Republican president, but, I mean, a Republican candidate will not win New York State.  No.  So, it doesn't matter to even vote Republican.  So, if you're a Republican living in New York, it don't...  New York has gone to the Democrats.  That's what they'll do.  It's like, okay, New York has gone...  Like, we're a year out, and I can guarantee that the Republican candidate will not win New York. 
[00:17:00]  No.  No.  Doesn't seem fair.  It's like, wait, but doesn't my vote count toward that?  No.  No.  It's the electoral votes of New York will go to the Democratic candidate.  Right.  That's just the way it works.  We think we actually can cast...  Let me cast my vote as an American.  There it is.  One vote.  Maybe if he wins by one, I could say it was me. 
[00:17:30]  No.  No.  Doesn't work that way.  All right.  The founding fathers knew that people were much too stupid to vote for a president.  We're dummies.  They needed the electoral college.  Whatever the hell that is.  Wherever it is.  I want to go there, but I didn't have enough credits.  Do they offer scholarships?  How's their football team this year?  You're right, by the way. 
[00:18:00]  It's always going to be the Democrats in New York.  The Republicans are going to probably take taxes.  It's...  Yeah.  And then there's the swing states that are the ones that, you know, that's why Florida  is always a pain in the ass.  It's kind of a swing state.  They're not really sure.  Ohio.  They don't know what they are down there.  What do we do?  Who do we vote for?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I need another commercial to tell me who sucks.  Well, we do have some great audio of Hillary, though.  Really?  Yeah, with her Hillary, you know, speech.  She's the best. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, speaking of which, I don't...  I just...  I'm trying to give Chris Rock some props, but he was talking about, like, Hillary for  president.  Yeah.  I got to read this, you know, because it's his joke, and I don't want to mess it up  too bad here.  So he's at the guard, and he's talking about Hillary.  On Hillary Clinton, Chris Rock said, I think America's ready for a woman president.  Not...  Just not that woman, meaning Hillary Clinton.  Being married to somebody doesn't make you good at their job.  Yeah.  And then Chris Rock goes on to say, I've been with my wife 10 years now. 
[00:19:00]  If she got up here right now, y'all wouldn't laugh at all.  And then he goes, you get on a plane tomorrow, you want the pilot's wife flying you?  That's good.  Chris Rock rules.  All right, here's the Hillary speech.  We'll do that after the break.  Just getting started here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  A very, very interactive radio show.  Give us a call.  877-212-ON-A.  Oh, really fast.  A quickie, because it'll set up a nice bit here. 
[00:19:30]  Zeppelin is going to be headlining Bonnaroo Festival in Tennessee this summer.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, they're going to be doing the headlining for Bonnaroo.  That's going to kick off a big world tour.  I've been wanting to go to Bonnaroo for a while now.  I think I'm going.  Do you want to go?  Seriously?  Yeah, yeah.  Are you just kidding?  No, no, I'm dead serious.  It's in...  My friend books it.  Seriously.  Are you going to perform?  I think so, yeah.  Oh, my God.  No.  Yeah, obviously not right before Zeppelin, but I mean, a different tent, I'm sure. 
[00:20:00]  Dude, I'm there.  If it goes through, I would like to.  Count me in, man.  I've been wanting to check out Bonnaroo for a while, so...  Is Metallica doing it?  I really don't know.  I just know that Zeppelin is headlining.  That news hit today, or yesterday, whatever.  Late yesterday.  Yeah.  And with that, we go to break with, of course, Club Soda Candy just singing a piece of Zeppelin  on the Opie and Anthony Show.  That ain't it.  What happened?  What happened?  That was a piece.  A piece of crap. 
[00:20:30]  Here it is.  There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold, and she's buying a stairwell.  And she's buying a stairway to heaven.  And when she gets there, she knows if the stores are all closed. 
[00:21:00]  With a word she can get what she came for.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
[00:21:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's a bit mellow.  I know it kicks in.  I know the song, but phone number 877-212-0&A.  Was this where it kicked in?  No, it kicks in with...  Yeah.  We have to wait a little longer for that part. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  I don't think it rolls around.  This gets crazy.  Two nuts for the morning.  Did they loop it?  Yes.  Oh, they just looped it so we don't even get...  Yuck.  I hate that.  What song is that?  Huh?  What?  No, I don't want the build-up.  We've got to go right to the show now.  OANARadio.com. 
[00:22:30]  Let's not forget about that.  That's where Stephen S. for Bayshore does his find.  Rundown.  Yes.  And the links to all the videos and visual things we talk about on the radio show.  So, okay.  Goodyah.  Goodyah is right.  Also, coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show, we're going to be doing the biggest gainer  contest.  Yeah, this is kind of taking off.  A lot of people want to be involved in this.  Yeah.  The emails were going all crazy last night.  We might have to get with the lawyers to see...  Well, just to see if maybe we could get a couple listeners to do it as well. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, okay.  I don't know, though.  But right now, it's between our show and the Ron and Fez show.  Yep.  And I'm a huge fan of Biggest Loser.  It makes me laugh.  It makes me not cry, but it makes me get a little choked up for these people as they're  losing lots and lots of weight.  They choke on ham sandwiches.  And then the show ends, and then they gain all the weight back.  But Biggest Loser doesn't want to acknowledge that or talk about that, by the way. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, last year...  No reunion shows?  Last year's winner lost an incredible amount away, right, on The Biggest Loser?  Uh-huh.  And he's from Long Island, and he probably even listens to our show.  Who knows?  Oh, sorry about that.  But he either owns or...  I think he owns like a deli.  And during the holidays, I was like at a Best Buy or something, and I was looking at DVDs  and stuff, and they have a Biggest Loser workout DVD.  And I noticed the guy who won Biggest Loser is part of this workout tape, but he's a lot 
[00:24:00]  bigger than when he won, but not as big as he used to be.  Yeah.  But the Biggest Loser people don't want to acknowledge that actually, you know, in the  end, these people end up going back to their regular lives and find it very, very hard to  continue exercising and eating perfectly.  And they end up gaining a lot of the weight back.  On the show itself, doesn't that take up, like, all of their time?  Aren't they dedicated to doing the show? 
[00:24:30]  So their whole life becomes losing weight.  They're out of campus.  Yeah.  They got pretty much around-the-clock trainers.  They got nutritionists.  They got doctors.  Oh, yeah.  So once you leave that environment, you're screwed.  Yeah.  And he owns a deli?  Yeah.  Oh, great.  He's just under...  His face under the slicer, just slicing ham into his mouth.  And with this Biggest Loser show, they usually bring back the past year winner.  Mm-hmm.  This past season that just ended, although they have now segued in to Biggest Loser couples 
[00:25:00]  that just started up, but the season that just ended, they never brought the winner back  from the year prior.  I wonder why.  Because he probably gained too much weight, and the Biggest Loser is like, this isn't  good for the show.  People are supposed to lose weight.  So, in honor of the fact that I watched that dumb show, we're doing Biggest Gainer.  Yeah.  And who's in so far from our team?  Well, Butcher.  Butcher? 
[00:25:30]  He's in.  He's one of our behind-the-scenes guys.  We were really bamboozled by him.  He comes across as a guy that's in shape.  Yeah.  He sort of has a superhero look to him.  We were calling him superhero for a while.  He's got the square jaw.  Yeah, square jaw.  He kind of looks like, you know.  He looks like the young version of the Incredibles dude.  There you go.  He could be the young version when he was a superhero. 
[00:26:00]  But that's what his face looks like.  The rest of his body looks like Incredibles dude when he was retired and, you know, out  of shape.  But you couldn't see it when he was wearing what he would wear because, I guess, he wears  baggy shirts.  I didn't notice, but he looked like he'd been working out or something.  No, he wears one baggy shirt.  And that would be his Lamb of God t-shirt.  And then yesterday he showed everybody, oh no, there's a mess under there.  Yeah. 
[00:26:30]  He has the potential of becoming really fat.  And he's so in as we do the biggest gainer contest very, very soon on the O.P. and Anthony  Show.  Butcher.  Yo, what's going on?  What's up?  Ed Brock, yo.  A.K.A.  Ed Brock.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm a big fat mess, but I'm all in for the contest.  Yeah, are you in training, though?  I just had my chocolate bar for breakfast.  No, no, no.  A breakfast chocolate bar.  We need you to lose weight before the weigh-in.  We're doing a little cheating now, because we have to wait for Ron and Fez to get back 
[00:27:00]  from vacation.  Yeah.  So I think this thing is going to go down early next week.  So between now and early next week, when we do the official weigh-in, you've got to  kind of be on a diet.  You shouldn't be eating chocolate bars for breakfast.  You want to weigh in light.  You want to weigh in way light.  We want to cheat a little bit.  We don't care how we win this contest.  Buy low, sell high.  That's what we're trying to do.  That's right.  So, you know, maybe a low-fat protein shake.  Maybe a little low-fat yogurt with a little sprinkle of granola for some crunch. 
[00:27:30]  That's all we want you to be eating right now.  And then just, you know, destroy yourself.  Yeah, as soon as the weigh-in's over, then you go all out.  I'd go for the anorexia, bulimia, finger-down-the-throat thing.  Yeah, whatever it takes.  We don't care.  For the next few days.  But Butcher is really in.  Yeah.  And who else do we got?  We got Pat Duffy?  We're going to ask Pat Duffy tomorrow?  Do we really have to ask Pat Duffy to do anything at this point?  The guy is a soldier. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  He will come to the table, I'm sure, and eat everything on it.  I love the guy.  I believe it's going to be a three-month contest, and it's basically going to just mock the biggest loser.  Now, here's one thing I found a little disturbing.  The lovely Lily wants to be involved in this from the Rana Fez show?  No, she doesn't.  She couldn't.  She wants in, supposedly.  But she wants in.  But explain Lily to the rest of America.  Lily is adorable, and she's very thin.  And very tall. 
[00:28:30]  Very thin.  It's got to be 5'9", 5'10", easy.  Yeah.  And a great hat collection?  A great, silly hat collection.  It looks good on you, though.  Yeah, Lily always does it.  She's dressed like to solve a crime somewhere.  Yeah, it looks like solving a crime or a Holly Hobby doll or just some wacky hat thing.  But she wears it well.  She looks like a model for a JCPenney catalog.  Yeah, she's kind of the girl next door.  For like a Sears catalog.  Is that an insult? 
[00:29:00]  But I can't see her gaining any weight.  I don't know.  I don't know if she's puking on the side.  Maybe because she can stop doing that.  She's real thin.  I mean, how much weight can you possibly...  Well, I guess we just win the contest is what happens.  I don't know.  There's got to be classes.  Like, if she's in, we'd have to put her in against our own skinny chick, Travis.  Travis. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Who's throwing his arms up in the air once again.  He just doesn't understand that he is a chick.  Oh.  A boy.  I'm a boy.  The beard hasn't thrown anyone off.  The one on your face or the one you married.  Believe me.  She's a lovely woman.  We love her.  I know.  You guys should be calling me Dylan and Lisa.  You fruit.  So, are you in this contest? 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, I'll do it.  I was telling Eric yesterday, like...  But how much weight could you possibly gain?  You are real thin, man.  I'm not going to gain more than, like, five pounds.  Like, it just doesn't happen.  You eat anything you want, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And you just don't gain any weight.  I'm about to have a disgusting sausage, egg, and cheese hash brown wrap thing for breakfast.  That's great.  I can eat...  I'll eat pasta, like, you know, five times a week.  I don't gain weight.  That's good.  And you save the c*** for dessert?  Yeah, you know, surprisingly, I don't gain weight from that either.  So, I mean, I'll do it, you know, no problem, but... 
[00:30:30]  See, I think classes, little categories like that might work.  Yeah.  And then we get somebody like Bronx Johnny to go up against maybe Butcher, because they're  more in the same category.  Butcher is our Robert De Niro in Raging Bull.  Yeah.  I think he can do it.  Yeah.  He's going to be a mess by the end of this contest.  We can only hope.  I can guarantee that.  I'll eat Johnny alive.  You think Bronx Johnny's in, too? 
[00:31:00]  I heard rumor.  Okay.  Well, we're getting the teams together.  We're getting our team together.  We're getting the Ron and Fez team together.  And I think the weigh-in goes down, hopefully, Monday or Tuesday of next week.  Screw this.  You've heard so many shows, TV shows, radio shows, even, because of sponsors or something  that they want to lose weight.  It's the whole lose weight thing.  Throw that out the window.  We want fatties.  Oh, yeah.  I want to see these people just destroy their bodies. 
[00:31:30]  For three months.  Stretch marks forever.  Yeah.  For the rest of the winter, basically.  The contest is going to end in early April.  Yeah.  I don't like Lily joining.  I don't like it.  That upsets you, doesn't it?  She's the only attractive person in the entire organization.  Yeah.  What happens?  There's no chicks.  There's one.  She wants to get fat.  There's one girl.  She wears her funny little hats.  She sure does.  She's always smoking a pipe.  Has a magnifying glass. 
[00:32:00]  Of course she does.  Looking for clues.  Yeah.  Silly.  Where's Earl's talent?  She can't find it.  No one can.  Not without the Hubble.  We're going to wreck her side career.  She's not going to be part of the back to school.  The back to school collection next year.  Catalog for Sears.  Just the pith helmet modeling career is now over.  Pith helmet.  But she'd look adorable in a pith helmet.  She would.  Every time I see Lillian in a hat, I just want to see her being boiled alive by natives. 
[00:32:30]  All right.  Well, game on, Butcher.  We're counting on you, buddy.  No problem.  I got your back, guys.  Don't worry about it.  How many pounds do you think you could gain in three months?  Oh, Jesus.  I don't know, man.  I'm just going to keep doing what I do, plus some, and we'll see how far I can take it.  He'll pack it on.  He's got the genetics for it.  You could see.  I'm thinking you could average five pounds a week through the whole contest.  I could definitely try. 
[00:33:00]  That would be 60 pounds, right?  More or less.  Maybe a little more.  70 pounds, call it.  Wow.  I'll end up being a diabetic by the end of this.  Right on.  See, Max has got it wrong also.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Stay there, Butch.  Max, what's up?  Hey, guys, I was wondering, you know, Willie might be a ringer if she got pregnant, just  for the contest.  No.  She would look like Talia Shire pregnant in The Godfather, just like real skinny with 
[00:33:30]  just the little basketball underneath her shirt.  Was it in The Godfather?  No, in The Godfather.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, when she was pregnant.  You know, clean us up.  Be a murderer like your father.  And she had this skinny little Talia Shire body.  And then, like, a softball in her gut.  I like her better in Rocky, too, when she could collapse on the bird feed.  She gave birth to a kid with, like, a Carmen, like, ragu wig. 
[00:34:00]  Hairiest chimp baby ever.  All right, Max.  Hey, oh, I got a...  All right, he punched out.  He punched out.  That's good.  I like that.  He saved himself, but the plane goes down and falls.  All right, Butcher.  Show some self-control between now and, like, Monday, maybe Tuesday at the latest.  Yeah.  Actually, let's try...  Let's get the Ron and Fez people together and get them organized, and Monday we'll do  the weigh-in.  Okay.  Official.  The official weigh-in is Monday, and then contest is on. 
[00:34:30]  I'm down.  All right, Butcher.  So, you know, eat a few salads, will you?  Finger down the throat.  I got you.  I got you.  That's the easy way.  We're going into cheat mode right now.  Lose as much weight as possible between now and Monday.  Indeed.  All right, buddy.  All right, dude.  All right.  Later.  I didn't even know his name was Ed.  Huh?  His name is Ed?  A.K.A. Ed Brock.  Right?  What a creepy name.  Ed.  Here's the Hillary thing we kind of teased going into the break. 
[00:35:00]  Her just babbling again.  Listen to this.  With her Hillary speech.  They've been coming after me for 16 years, and much to their dismay, I'm still here, and  I intend to be, still here in November 2008, so go to the caucus tomorrow.  Stand up for me for one night, so that I can stand up for you, and together, we'll make  progress again in America.  Thank you all, and God bless you.  I want to see that music play and have her head explode. 
[00:35:30]  Just watch her head explode when Slim Whitman plays.  I am distracting you by the way I speak.  How can anyone...  I'm not saying anything up here.  Exactly.  God, God, God, God.  How can anyone listen to that and feel any sincerity in what she says?  It's political.  It's oldie time politician cadence. 
[00:36:00]  She galvanizes you into making a nice warm bath and opening your wrist into it.  Yeah.  What a zilch.  And we are going to go ahead and win the caucus!  So I can stand up for you!  For you!  America!  It's been 16 years!  Shut up.  It's time for a change!  Oh, and enough of her. 
[00:36:30]  A change, like a big change.  What?  And you're just talking the only change would be a vagina replacing a penis.  That's pretty much it.  Yeah.  Because everything else will remain the same.  She'll just be some dopey politician in there.  You can tell by the way she talks.  She's been raised to be a politician.  Her whole life has been just...  Wouldn't that be a good thing, though?  What?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  I hate them all, to be honest.  It's not going to be anything new. 
[00:37:00]  Like, she's talking about this new thing.  What new?  Okay.  A vagina.  That's the only new thing she's offering the White House.  That could be fun to watch, though.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You can tell when she's on her you-know-what.  If she still gets her you-know-what.  I'll probably not.  Please.  That thing just pruned up years ago, I'm sure.  Just barren.  She wakes up and there's a tumbleweed in the bed.  She says, oh, my friend is here. 
[00:37:30]  What happened?  I used to be a woman!  What are they saying?  A dead heat between Hill, they like to call her Hill, and Obama?  Yeah.  I don't like any of them.  Nope.  I might vote for Hucklebee, because he's got a funny name.  Hucklebee?  I heart Hucklebee?  I call him Hucklebee.  The Hucklebuck.  Who are you going to vote for, Jimmy?  If the vote was today.  Obama.  You're not voting for Obama. 
[00:38:00]  Just stop it.  Why?  Because Oprah told him, I want a black president.  Why?  Why not?  So you're voting based strictly on skin color.  Nah, they're all so-  You might as well find something.  They're all so-  Just because it's different?  Is that what it is?  You look at you being eating the same food, and you're like, I'll try this out.  What happens if you take a big mouthful and don't like it?  It's not going to be any different than what's been going on.  Oh, yes, it will.  Well, maybe.  Trust me, it will. 
[00:38:30]  Hank gets very paranoid about-  That's all I'm saying.  About the possibility of a black president.  I want to-  I don't know.  No, no, because before Colin Powell screwed the pooch by just getting on all fours and  lapping George Bush, he had a pretty promising political career.  I believe he would have made a good president, but this Barack Obama is a little too not in 
[00:39:00]  the best interest of the entire country.  He scares you.  He frightens me.  I see it in your eyes.  And he's holding back.  He's holding back, but I see through the veneer.  I see.  He scares the hell out of you, huh?  Petrified.  Petrified.  I'll be honest with you.  Petrified.  What scares you about Obama? 
[00:39:30]  Like I said-  Is that going to take care of Whitey?  Let's get into this.  I don't think the best interest of the majority of the nation-  Whitey.  Is in his mind.  I won't say Whitey.  I'll just say the majority of the nation is in his best interest.  I think a lot of little interest groups will get a lot of his attention.  I think my already overinflated, abloated tax bill will be going toward things that I  really don't want them to go towards. 
[00:40:00]  That's what I'm saying.  And I think it'll be even more so.  I think we're really got the hell taxed out of us.  I just-  And that wife of his.  Oh, boy.  If I could use the word, I would.  Not that word.  Not that word.  I use that in the privacy of my own home and car.  But I'm talking-  She's a little too involved.  A little too involved.  In what way? 
[00:40:30]  Um, I think she has a lot of influence over him.  I think he's pee-whipped.  I honestly think he is.  You're insane.  And she's got some wacky ideas.  Like what?  Well, again, I don't think the majority of this country is really in their agenda.  But is the majority of the country in any real politician's agenda?  Like, and I don't think the Republicans are just for the rich. 
[00:41:00]  But it's like Bush, Bush, you know, I don't think he's for the majority of Americans.  I think he's for a small percentage of Americans, too.  I mean, they all kind of are.  I think you would see if Barack Obama was elected.  I think you would see things change a little more negatively in this country.  Why are you beating around the bush?  What are you trying to say?  All right, let's look at New York City under Mayor Dinkins. 
[00:41:30]  He had an agenda based on skin color.  He did.  He did.  He'd go to a black drug dealer's bedside in a hospital that was shot by the police.  That was just one time.  I don't care with one time.  He also did white things like he loved tennis and he would leave his limo air conditioning on in the middle of an energy crisis.  He got that's a white guy thing to do.  That's a strife hand.  All right, I'll give him that. 
[00:42:00]  I just don't know.  I don't know.  The country's not.  Wait a few years until there's an influx, until we're a little more of a melting pot, which I mean by a melting pot.  Third world country.  And then we can have, I don't even think president's a good word, warlord.  I like the word.  Africa has a great day.  Warlords.  I like them.  They go around with machetes.  Someone disagrees.  They get hacked apart.  You want us to elect a warlord.  A warlord.  But I don't think America's ready for a warlord yet. 
[00:42:30]  I think we need more people to be so politically correct that we keep this influx of people coming into this country that really probably don't contribute that much.  They don't assimilate to our society.  And then after a while, when the country is completely destroyed, then I think it's a good idea to have a president that might better represent the majority of the people in the country. 
[00:43:00]  So who are you going to vote for?  That's a toughie.  I will probably cast my vote for Rudy Giuliani if he is the Republican candidate.  And let me tell you something.  What about McCain?  The Democrats.  What about McCain?  The Democrats are morons because if they cannot turn every disenfranchised Republican around and get them to vote for a viable candidate, 
[00:43:30]  they're insane, and they can't.  I wanted to vote Democrat for last election I wanted to, and this election I want to.  But they parade out a freak show.  It's like Barnum and Bailey.  I don't want a gag ticket.  And a woman or a black president at this point is not a viable candidate for the country. 
[00:44:00]  I flew to Colorado recently, Opie.  I looked down on middle America.  I looked out the window and looked down there and saw a bunch of, although I didn't see people, I just saw land.  But I knew that land was full of people that would never vote for a woman or a black person.  You pretty much looked down on everybody.  I looked down on everyone.  If that window opened, I would spit out on it.  But it's not really ready, that middle part of the country.  And you could see that from way up in the sky.  Of course I could. 
[00:44:30]  What do you see?  I could see it from first class in the plane.  What are they carving into their crops in the middle of America?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  You should see those crop circles.  Yeah.  They don't look like aliens drawn.  Aliens don't know the letter N.  It's just that America's not ready.  So if either Hillary or Obama get the nod from the Democrats to run, you will see another Republican president. 
[00:45:00]  You will.  Giuliani sucks.  Giuliani does suck.  He's got a lot of skeletons in his closet.  He's made a lot of bad decisions.  But, and his health is questionable.  You don't know why.  Why the hell was he in the hospital?  No one knows.  He was in the hospital.  They kept him there.  They couldn't even fly him.  He's on the plane.  They couldn't fly him back to New York where the best hospitals are.  They had to leave him in some podunk little hospital somewhere.  So he could come out and smile and wave and walk to his limo. 
[00:45:30]  Something was going on there.  Does it bother you he's still like kind of doing the whole 9-11 thing during the campaign?  Everyone else is using it for some reason or another.  So, I mean, why shouldn't he?  He's the only one, though, that I think should be using it.  I mean, people do forget pretty quickly, but he was, you know, right there.  The guy was right there.  He kind of was the guy that everyone looked towards for guidance in what to do. 
[00:46:00]  He distributed resources like a leader, like a true leader.  He was able to do that.  But he wasn't a popular figure.  September 10th, everyone hated him.  Right, exactly.  September 11th, he was America's mayor.  He made the city better, though, the little quality of life.  He did, quality of life stuff.  And what about Bloomberg?  I like Bloomberg a lot.  Supposedly he might enter the race as a third-party candidate there.  He's got his own money. 
[00:46:30]  On the third-party ticket.  He's got his own money.  He doesn't need special interest money.  He does have his own money.  I like that.  I would love to vote for him in a second, Bloomberg.  Yeah.  I like his little wimpy voice, and he's kind of androgynous.  He does.  He really doesn't care what he says, either.  No, he'd care less.  He's a billionaire.  He's a billionaire, yeah.  He's too short to be president.  Yeah, it's still about looks?  Yeah.  Because then Giuliani ain't got a shot in hell.  Nah.  When was the last time we had a president without a head of hair?  Kennedy.  Who was the last?  Oh, Jesus.  Right at the end. 
[00:47:00]  At the end of Kennedy's term.  One bad haircut and it's all over.  Wow.  But it's true.  When was the last president that didn't have a full head of hair?  You kind of have to look good to be president.  You got to go back to, like, the big top hat days.  Who was the last mess to be president?  Richard Nixon?  The last mess?  Probably.  You could consider Nixon a mess.  Yeah.  The wacky nose and the receding hairline.  Yeah.  And he sweat a lot on live TV. 
[00:47:30]  Gerald Ford kind of had something going on there.  But he wasn't elected.  Nah, Ford.  He was all right.  But he wasn't elected.  But he was all right.  Reagan had the looks.  Reagan had the big...  Ford looked like he was an old, like...  Dog duty hairdo.  Ford has that old...  He's an old jock, just older.  You know what I mean?  He looked all right.  But people didn't have to vote for him.  That's what I'm saying.  Like, people want to vote for someone who's more attractive.  Give us the...  How did he get in? 
[00:48:00]  Spiro Agnew had a little problems with the IRS and various things and had a bug out.  And then Nixon got...  And he took over as vice president.  And then Nixon had a little problem with Watergate and thrown out.  And then all of a sudden, hey, I'm president and I wasn't even elected.  Hey, this is what we're going to do.  We have to take a break.  We're real late here.  Iraq, you've got to find us the montage of all the presidents.  And I want to look at ugly presidents.  After the break.  Ugly presidents. 
[00:48:30]  Ugly presidents after the break.  Someone's saying Truman was an ugly bastard, but...  And then Johnson was no looker.  And people are saying that the last...  Looker.  People are saying the last bald president was Eisenhower.  Mmm.  All right, we'll figure it out after the break.  I like Ike.  I want to look at all the presidents.  But war hero.  And we're going to point out the ugly ones for everybody.  All right.  And we're going to do that next.  Harry Truman was a good-looking older gentleman.  And he dropped the bomb.  Jesus, you've got to give him some credit for that.  But he had a bird nose. 
[00:49:00]  His nose made you uncomfortable.  Yeah.  That's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out Opie and Anthony.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Trying to look at a montage of all the presidents we've had in America.  To kind of point out some ugly ones. 
[00:49:30]  I remember that Dick Clark segment yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  That was hilarious.  Hysterical.  A lot of people were talking about it.  Yeah.  Yep.  It was very funny.  Happy New Year.  Happy New Year, sure.  My girlfriend had quite a few chuckles in the vehicle.  Yeah, people were coming up to me yesterday talking about it.  And then, of course, on the game, on Call of Duty 4, online, all my gay friends. 
[00:50:00]  I mean, from the clan, the G-A-A-Y.  That's Bob Kelly's clan.  Did he start that one, Than?  Do you know that?  Of course he did.  If he started it or just joined it.  But, yeah, they were just raving over the Dick Clark stuff.  One gentleman gave me quite a compliment and said he liked the old lava lamp head. 
[00:50:30]  There was some...  I love when it goes, ow, and you're playing the electrical shock.  Zapping him.  I'm trying to get to the bottom of something.  Because the whole Dick Clark thing we did yesterday, which was really, really funny.  It was the big bit yesterday on the Opie and Anthony show.  It wasn't really represented on Stephen S. from Bayshore's rundown yesterday.  Much to Stephen S.'s chagrin. 
[00:51:00]  That is featured on onaradio.com.  And I don't really understand why.  E-Rock's bringing it up now.  E-Rock's bringing it up now.  Hmm.  Where would it be?  I'm hearing that Steve wrote something very, very different than what appeared on the rundown yesterday.  Oh, oh.  Are you scanning that there, Jimmy? 
[00:51:30]  Eric, I'll let Eric scan it because I can't...  I'll see if you can find it, baby girl.  That's his nickname.  Wait, let me read.  Let me read.  Right there.  Go up a little, right?  Go up a little.  All right.  The Times Square ball has gone green.  It now only uses the same amount of electricity a few toasters would consume because they've put energy-efficient bulbs in it.  How nice.  Let's just ignore the fact that the rest of Times Square was, for hours that night, lit up like the sun. 
[00:52:00]  And then there's a quote.  Don't daze me.  Brr.  Okay.  Yeah, he spelled out brr.  Don't taze me.  In keeping with the green theme, Dick Clark's body will be going green later this year, then gray, then into a multicolored, writhering pile of maggots.  What do they edit?  Seems pretty...  So much for being nice. 
[00:52:30]  Some people were photographed wearing diapers in Times Square.  Yeah, that's right.  It seemed that there are no bathrooms available for people celebrating New Year's Eve to use, so a few people had the idea to use diapers in case of any accidents.  Geez, yeah, what did they take out?  Yeah, what did they take out?  And that's it.  Yeah, we went off a little more on that.  And then Happy New Year.  But a lot of the Dick Clark jokes are just not represented in the rundown. 
[00:53:00]  No.  Because we don't want to offend anybody.  Why?  I'll find out.  I'll find out on the next break.  Jimmy's our spokesperson.  Like we said, we have to be nice.  Jimmy's like a...  It's radio.  Jimmy's really good.  Jimmy's like a politician.  I get nothing accomplished, because then my stupid anger gets involved.  I don't either.  But Jimmy asks real questions.  I don't either.  Oh, you don't get anything?  No!  Have you seen any changes?  I just stand at Tom's office like Hillary.  We need change on the...  Nothing.  You need to let us do what we know how to do! 
[00:53:30]  Radio!  Stay out!  And then Jimmy comes in all angry, and he spits on his own floor.  Yeah, Tom, you might want to clean the rug around here.  You can always tell how mad Jimmy is by how wet around his chair gets.  I spit on the stage at the cellar the other night, because somebody was heckling me.  Yeah.  And I just smashed them, and I was so angry, and the crowd was applauding, but I had to spit  just to show them.  Was it that broad?  Yeah.  Because Bobby Kelly told me about her. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What happened?  That she said something nasty to Jimmy about the new year.  And I heard you just laid into her, and it was fantastic.  Yeah, I might have it on her boyfriend.  I might have it on TV.  Oh!  Oh, really?  We'll play it maybe.  There's nothing more vicious than watching a genuinely angered Jimmy go after somebody  in the crowd.  When somebody says something, and it's good-natured, and the idiot's just trying to be funny, I think  you give them the benefit of the doubt. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You kind of shut them up.  But when someone's being, like, drunk, stupid, saying crap that's just trying to be vicious  to you, oh, why do they bother?  Well, I don't understand why you would do that in a live performance anyway, unless someone  was attacking you personally, but I wasn't, and she, whatever.  So it feels kind of good to do that, because the problem is she probably doesn't get enough  of that.  I really attacked her boyfriend more, because he was, you know, proud to pipe up for her  and whatever.  He's a dude.  What did she say? 
[00:55:00]  Did I miss something?  I was sarcastically addressing the new year.  I wasn't having a decent set.  I was like, you know, I hope you all have fun with your hats, whatever I was saying.  And your noisemakers.  Yeah, he was being all, like, okay.  That's what Bobby said.  You were being all just passive-aggressive, like, kind of, hey, have a great new year  with your hats and noisemakers.  But I really was just kind of kidding around.  She's like, well, I hope you're funnier.  Oh.  Yeah, in 2008.  Yeah. 
[00:55:30]  Oh.  No, she didn't.  Oh, no, you didn't.  So then what'd you do?  I kind of, I, like, who said that?  Who said that?  Of course.  Were you biting your teeth?  I was really unhappy.  But then I...  You ever try to bite your teeth?  Yeah.  It's like impossible.  It's bad.  It's bad.  You could crack them.  You need the other set of teeth to actually bite the teeth.  You'll crack them, though.  But you say you really try to bite them, though.  I can talk to them relatively well.  But try biting your teeth.  He's a crooked cop.  You're not officially biting them.  He was a crooked cop. 
[00:56:00]  Bad cop.  We have people on the newspaper, don't we, Tom?  So what'd you do?  I just kind of...  Thank you, Steve.  I think I smashed her and her boyfriend, because he had to talk to me in the bathroom.  He tried to make a little joke in the bathroom.  And he's like, I'm the guy from the bathroom.  And then I just kind of made fun of the fact that Mo had spoken to me in the bathroom.  Oh, very good.  Actually, Jimmy just said, look, it's a...  Look!  Look at the...  Look at him!  It's a...  Look at the...  Is that what you did? 
[00:56:30]  Yes, I did.  I certainly did, and then I slid on the floor.  Made a wacky noise.  Yes, thank you, Glenn Dandy.  Very nice.  Okay, moving on to other things.  Yeah, this minivan crash from yesterday, we didn't get to, because we had a very, very busy show.  Minivan crashes into the news studio, live on TV.  This is pretty funny, man.  They're doing their live shot from their little side studio there. 
[00:57:00]  Where's this out of?  ABC News Studio in Chicago.  Okay.  Chicago.  ComEd crews are working to restore power to thousands of homes in our area,  and Chicago firefighters are doing their very difficult jobs tonight.  ABC 7's Michelle Gallardo joining us now live from the scene of one fire tonight,  where two people were injured, Michelle, and the weather made the rescue work all that much more...  Oh!  It certainly did rub, you know, this was an automatic call.  Dummy! 
[00:57:30]  Hey, dummy!  A car just crashed into the newsroom.  Wait, oh, so he's in the newsroom.  She's outside somewhere else in the city.  Uh-oh!  Oh, the video's pretty good.  We'll have that linked up later on on onaradio.com.  She doesn't miss a beat.  She doesn't miss a beat.  She's got her story, damn it, and she's going to finish it.  Sammy, you got something else to add to this?  No.  Oh.  Then why you got headphones on, and why are you standing there?  With your massive afro.  Just in case you had any questions.  Well, what?  Self-explanatory. 
[00:58:00]  Well, I didn't know the video was being shown, so, you know, in case...  How about the minivan and stuff?  Yeah.  How many miles per gallon did it get?  What are you going to offer?  Is it fuel efficient?  All right.  Very nice.  There you go.  Mm-hmm.  That's great.  Yeah.  That is a good one.  Well, she had explosives in it.  Oh.  If I'm with that, baby.  And she would still do a stupid story.  It just really was an explosive delivery service. 
[00:58:30]  Bill's Bomb Emporium.  And then there's, like, this really strange story.  The son, adopted son, was searching for his birth mom.  And finds out that he's been working with her at Lowe's.  What?  The whole time.  How does that happen?  That stuff...  Come on.  That stuff's weird.  That's...  And that's not weird.  It was some kind of arranged thing.  Someone knew.  What do you mean?  Someone figured it out, and they were working together. 
[00:59:00]  Steve Flake has been searching online for his birth mother for four years, finding nothing.  Then he noticed he was spelling his birth mother's last name wrong.  He fixed it...  Tummy.  ...and got a hit.  The home address of a woman in Grand Rapids.  And I thought, well, that's really close to Lowe's, where I work, and I bet I've seen her in the store,  not really knowing to what extent I'd seen her in the store.  He was telling a co-worker about the mix-up, that the name was Tallady, not Talladay. 
[00:59:30]  And she's like, do you mean, like, the Chris Tallady that works here, the one head cashier up front?  A manager looked up the home address.  It was a match.  It was his mother.  But Steve didn't know what to say, so he waited.  Just seeing her at work and thinking, that's my mom, and this is very, very strange.  Last week, an adoption agency worker agreed to break the news to Chris,  explaining only that a co-worker named Steve was the son she'd given up for adoption 22 years ago.  Hello, why'd you give me up? 
[01:00:00]  Little hairy child.  Thought it was a monkey.  That's kind of wild, huh?  Yeah.  That is a little odd.  What are the odds?  600,000 to two.  Wait a minute, then it would only be 300,000 to one.  Right.  For eight months, the cashier and the delivery guy had worked together, joked around.  You did the same to me?  I had sex.  Never suspecting they were mother and son. 
[01:00:30]  It was just like, you know, hug me.  Yeah.  Hug me.  I haven't seen you in ages.  You know, hug me.  And we just sat down and just talked.  You ditched me, you bitch.  What's with the hug?  You ditched me.  Why the hell would you hug her?  I haven't seen you since I abandoned you for drinking fun.  You know, the guy, when he found out, should have done everything he could to have sex with her.  And then right in the middle of it, go, you know who I am? 
[01:01:00]  You're.  You're stunned.  Right then.  Right then.  And just try to screw her up emotionally like she did him.  And it would be sexy.  Hell yeah.  How do you get a hug in that scenario?  You don't.  How do you not say, so, how's things going?  I'm glad to see your life got a little better that you got rid of me.  You're working here at Lowe's. 
[01:01:30]  Same thing I'm doing.  Right.  Because I had no self-worth.  Yeah.  Because my mommy got rid of me.  Yeah.  What'd you get rid of me for?  To get your career going?  You're working at Lowe's like me.  Didn't work out for you, did you?  Yeah, what happened?  Did it.  Maybe she would have kept me.  You had something to work for.  Oh.  What a despicable woman.  I'm dubbing her despicable.  Well, let's hear about the hug.  Just talked, and we have so much in common. 
[01:02:00]  Now they're easing from co-workers into family members.  She owns the water slide he came at her.  That's what I was hoping.  That he would turn out to be a good person.  Good genes.  Good genes.  That's wonderful.  Thank you.  They like what they see in each other, and in their future.  Hope they're both shot in a robbery.  Enough of these two.  Enough of these two.  That's your feel-good story.  That is not a feel-good story.  That's a nice little story.  They hook up, they'll probably end up having a nice little, you know, few decades together. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  You know something?  After the initial hug, and this is all great, is over.  And they're just sitting together.  Yeah.  Now-  And things start coming out.  Now that we got that out of the way, I got a few questions for you, mommy.  So what happened?  What happened that you had to get rid of me?  Oh, well, you know, it was the 80s.  I was doing coke.  I was just banging.  I have a few questions for Miss Selfish.  Exactly. 
[01:03:00]  Did you get a new car because you had extra money to spend?  None of that pesky baby food to buy, right, ma?  Right.  What do you use that money on?  Drugs?  Well, yeah.  You irresponsible mommy.  Yeah, that'll end poorly.  I hope.  I hate to see anyone happy.  Yeah?  Yeah, we're horrible people here.  Oh, they closed this door, and it's just an inner sanctum of misery. 
[01:03:30]  Let's go to Matt in Boston.  Matt?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Hi.  Listen, I'm a 40-year-old guy.  I'm an adult adoptee.  I met my birth mother when I was 18.  I have two adopted kids of my own.  Oh.  At the end of the show, I've never understood before when people call you and make a joke  about a retarded kid or whatever it is, and they've got a retarded kid, and they get  all worked up.  I never understood how that felt until now.  Oh, no.  Head too close to home, huh?  Exactly.  I'm laughing at what you're saying, but I hate you. 
[01:04:00]  Oh.  Oh, no.  Well, let's delve into this a little bit.  We're just talking about this story, first of all.  Not all adopted kids that, you know, aren't really loved.  I'm teasing, of course.  See, I wanted to get a little reaction out of you.  No.  Isn't this story a little odd, though?  Like, she ditched the kid.  Yeah.  And then she ends up at Lowe's working with him. 
[01:04:30]  Well, how old is she?  I mean, she was probably, what, 16, 17 when he was born?  That's what I'm guessing.  Somewhere in there.  So mom was a little whore, which is, you know, kind of hot.  Why does this upset you, though?  Everyone's got their own situation.  Well, my mother was 16 when I was born.  She, you know, obviously, she came from a religious family, went out to a home for unwed mothers,  and, you know, and then just sort of, you know, when I met her 18 years later, it was a lot of that, you know, 
[01:05:00]  what happened and why, and she did the right thing, as far as I'm concerned.  Did you get the right answers?  Were you satisfied with her explanation?  Yeah.  I'm a 16-year-old kid, you know, rebelling away from home, and, you know, what are you going to do?  Do you guys have a relationship now?  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  She came to my wedding.  She lives in Holland, so she came to my wedding.  She met my family for the first time there, and, you know, we emailed back and forth and all that stuff.  She should have gotten one of them abortions.  I'm thinking it wouldn't have worked out so good for me. 
[01:05:30]  No, see?  It could always be worse.  Yeah.  I think adopted kids get a lot of love.  I do believe that, but that's got to be, I don't know.  I wasn't adopted, so I don't know.  Yeah, I'm not in that situation.  But I would be.  How do I know?  I think I'd be pretty pissed off.  Yeah.  Thank you.  I don't know, though.  I'm not in that situation, but I'd be like, what the F?  The situation where you get together with that mom that was 16, and you start talking, is there any resentment in you? 
[01:06:00]  To be honest, not really.  Maybe a little disappointment, because I guess every adopted, when he's pissed at his adopted parents,  oh, my real parents are princesses in some foreign land, and they're going to come take me away and sit,  and then you find out they work at Lowe's.  I'm right next to you.  Like, princesses in foreign lands.  Yeah.  Never works out that way.  No.  All right, Matt.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  Don't hate us too much.  No, he actually was laughing, but it hit a little close to home. 
[01:06:30]  Hey, you guys are great.  Hey, Godspeed.  Matt in Boston listening on BCN.  We've got to take a break.  When we get back.  The show's falling apart, by the way.  Oh, I know.  We were supposed to do something, and we didn't.  No, I think we sound all right, but my throat is freaking killing me.  Like, there's razor blades in it.  Nice.  Jimmy is, like...  My left eye is tearing because I had that stupid sinus tickle.  Oh, that is the worst.  And I want to just dig my finger all the way up and find out. 
[01:07:00]  It's somewhere back in my septum where my finger won't reach.  And it's driving...  I'm just twitching my eye.  And it's just tickling you, and you can't even rub the top of your nose to get at it, right?  Can you scratch it with a Q-tip?  No, no.  It's way in there.  It's making his eye water.  I know.  He's blowing snot.  It's just the snot moving around in my septum.  That's what's making the tickle.  It's like the boogers are just kind of moving around, and they're coming out.  Oh, my God.  Is it a viscous mucus, or is it solid matter? 
[01:07:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Don't even.  You know how I feel about that fluid.  All right, well.  Well, Jimmy's got to go down the hall.  We have the original rundown, by the way.  Yeah, that's good.  So, Jimmy will get an answer or two, and we'll be back.  Oh, when we get back, though, we do have something really good.  Program aims to cure sex offenders with smells.  You're not going to believe what smells they're using.  I could guess which ones they're not.  Trout. 
[01:08:00]  Cotton candy.  Zap.  You'll find out what smells they're using.  Bubblegum and pencil erasers.  You get zapped to try to cure sex offenders.  Maybe the listeners could guess as well.  We'll do that after the break.  Opie, Anthony, old Jim Norton.  Oh, my God.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[01:08:30]  Hope you're having a good morning.  How couldn't you?  What?  What happened?  Have a good morning.  Oh, I guess if your house burnt down.  Yeah.  That would suck.  That would suck.  Okay.  That's a bad morning.  Hey, I noticed it was getting a little, uh, because you brought up the fact that it's,  uh, it's lighter out a little later.  Yeah.  Kind of like that.  Not noticing yet.  I did notice.  We're only, uh, like 12 minutes. 
[01:09:00]  I noticed.  Lighter since December 21st.  When I, when I, when I leave the gym, it's usually pitch black, dark, and now it wasn't.  No, it's too early for that.  But every day, what?  I noticed.  Every day we get a minute of, uh, a minute more of sunlight.  Yes.  You're not noticing yet.  I'm sorry.  No, you're not.  No, you're not.  No, you're not.  No, you're not.  I've noticed this since midnight.  A program aims to cure sex offenders with smells. 
[01:09:30]  This is a very unique program.  With smells.  Yes.  Sex offenders.  Now, does this cover all sex offenders?  Like, uh, rapists or just like a child, uh, offender?  I don't know.  I'm sick today.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Well, so are they.  Yeah, apparently.  Don't ask such tough questions on a sick day.  I didn't even listen to this stuff today.  Are you kidding me?  I'm going through the motions. 
[01:10:00]  I'm dying.  I have to get back to bed.  I'm dying over here.  I don't know.  Just break down and start crying in the middle of the show.  Don't make me do a little scream therapy today.  No.  Uh, I don't know.  We'll find out together.  How's that?  All right.  Usually I know the answer to your questions.  I like that.  How about this?  No more questions today.  Search it out together.  No more questions.  I can't handle it.  Oh, God. 
[01:10:30]  He's coughing now.  Oh, that's good.  A laugh turns into a cough.  One of those wheezing coughs.  No, my throat is so effing dry.  And Tom's coming in here.  He's being, uh, he's being a good guy.  Brought me some tea with lemon.  He brought me some of these, uh, these halls.  He brought you chamomile tea.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why don't you bring in some coldies?  That's what helps.  I did some emergency.  I just need something that just soothes the throat so I can sleep today. 
[01:11:00]  That's all.  I can offer you something.  You might not like it.  No.  Keep your HIV to yourself.  Yeah.  You won't be worrying about your sore throat.  Bigger fish to fry.  Very excited, though, because I'm going to lose all that weight I gained over the holidays.  Yeah.  You don't look like you gained any, actually.  I'm in sick mode right now, so I'll probably drop five or six in the next week.  Via the toilet.  Right.  No, I'm keeping everything down, although the, uh, the, uh, you know what's were just horrendous. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, God.  I decided I needed some vegetarian chili after the show yesterday.  Didn't work out for you?  Whoa.  Yeah.  And then one of those, uh, cutie things.  Oh, Tofutti cutie.  No, you didn't have a Tofutti cutie.  John, who's like, uh, like.  Just have ice cream for the love of God.  John, who's like a man's man.  He, he, he runs the building I live in.  I saw him at the supermarket with his wife.  Yeah.  And, uh.  Picked up some Tofutti cuties. 
[01:12:00]  They were picking up some.  Opie, you need some cuties?  Tofutti cuties?  This guy.  Yeah.  This guy will lean out from the 40th floor to fix a window pane.  But, man, his dessert choices are a little lame.  After I do that, I like coming in and having a little Tofutti cutie.  So, well, let me tell you something, though.  Between the, uh, vegetarian chili, three bean.  And then the Tofutti cutie. 
[01:12:30]  Wow.  Just a mess.  Wow.  You open up the lid, it looks like the beginning of Saving Private Ryan.  Oh, no, no, no.  I didn't want to say it was, uh, I haven't gotten to that point yet.  Oh, no.  Okay, good.  I just decided to hang out for a while for whatever reason.  Hey, why don't we, uh, play audio from this program?  Yeah.  I want to find out what this is all about.  All right.  Thanks, Jim.  This seems like a, what happened?  I don't know.  I just heard Jim making some noises from a certain area that wasn't his mouth. 
[01:13:00]  Can I have that Lysol, uh, Danny?  It's right there by you.  It's my stuffy nose.  Thanks.  Yeah.  And Jim's blinking a lot.  This is for my unstuffy nose.  I'm just going to spray a little Lysol.  It's a, it's a, it's a tickle where in the back of my head, that sinus drip tickle.  No, that tickle was probably your sphincter.  That was my, that was my, um, my body gets very tense when I'm, when I'm drippy.  Oh, we're the worst, man.  We just had like, I don't know, almost two weeks off.  We could have, we had plenty of time to be sick during our time off. 
[01:13:30]  Yep.  All right, here we go.  So, uh, different kinds of offenders, uh, okay, listen to this.  Some people believe sex offenders cannot be changed.  Some experts say not true.  They say they're doing it right here in the Portland area.  Well, that's right.  It's right there in Portland.  They've, they're finally deciding to do something.  Right in Portland.  Good for them.  Logging and, and curing sex offenders.  What a great area of the country. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, right here in the Portland area.  Well, that's right.  It's not the same treatment for every sex offender.  The psychiatrist and the social worker behind this program in Portland say they divide things  up between two different kinds.  The predatory sex offender who is out looking to grab kids and what they call the situational,  someone who might have done a one-time molestation in, say, a home setting, which is considered  to be less severe.  And they say it's this second group, this less severe group that responds very well  to their kind of treatment. 
[01:14:30]  The manipulative, uh, why doesn't the first group die that we're home setting?  What the hell does that even mean?  Some creepy neighbor or something that someone trusts him?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's good.  They should cure him with a bullet right to his forehead.  The smell of cordite.  Boom.  It's over.  By the way, someone is definitely, uh, lingering a little bit longer today.  Limited.  He, uh, he writes, uh, did the flu lady from Juneau make Opie sick?  Damn her.  Oh. 
[01:15:00]  I guess, uh, ducking down in my seat as she was sneezing behind me didn't, uh.  Didn't work.  Didn't prevent me from getting it.  How many days does it take, by the way?  I don't think the CDC recommends just ducking.  Yeah.  To get out of the way of someone who sneaks.  Well, I, I, I played, like, bank robber too, though.  I don't think that works either.  Bank robber and, and, uh.  You ever see healthcare workers doing that?  I'm going low in my seat.  That should have worked.  Contagions.  That stuff should have worked.  You ever see them just pull their shirt over their nose?  You know why they don't do that? 
[01:15:30]  Why?  Because it doesn't work.  It makes, uh, you feel like it might, though.  Yeah.  That's all that matters.  How, how long does it take?  If someone's sneezing behind you at a movie.  A sneeze travels at well over 180 miles an hour.  Thank you, Anthony.  So I don't think you could, um, cover up.  In time.  In time, yeah.  Does the sneeze itself make you sick?  I would think so, sure.  Why?  A lot of germs coming out of your nose.  Why?  Because you got, uh, all those, uh, uh, viral germs. 
[01:16:00]  Really?  Those little viruses shooting out of the nose.  Oh, Jesus, don't sneeze.  I just scared myself.  Jimmy, for the rest of the show, just, just make believe you're going to sneeze and look at it.  Oh, it's not that hard.  I can feel a sneeze coming.  Isn't it easy to make it look like you're going to sneeze?  But to actually do an authentic acting sneeze is hard.  Watch.  Tell me if this makes you paranoid.  But you can go, tell me if this makes you paranoid.  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[01:16:30]  And then that's all you get.  What a fool.  How's this?  I put my finger up and I go, ah, choo.  I look around like everyone's scared.  That's very, that's very good.  Coming from me.  Yes, of course.  All right, here we go.  Let's find out more about the sex offender program here.  Spend an hour in this chair alone in this room and you'll feel sick, afraid, ashamed.  That's just what the doctors want.  It won't be an Anthony show.  A guest. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, that'll make the intro to the show, huh?  Please.  Oh, yeah.  Let me hear that again.  That does sound like an intro for this show.  Do we have like, Opie and Anthony.  I'll do Opie and Anthony, guy.  Spend an hour in this chair alone in this room and you'll feel sick, afraid, ashamed.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Perfect.  Spend an hour in this chair alone in this room and you'll feel sick, afraid, ashamed. 
[01:17:30]  That's just what the doctors want.  It worked very well.  My arousal has gone down very much.  Oh.  Very much with it.  Ew.  You creep.  Here, smell this.  Here, I think this one might do it.  Okay, look at this picture.  Are you aroused?  Yes.  Now, smell this. 
[01:18:00]  Okay.  Next.  Okay.  I want you to take a whiff of this.  Now, this is more of a subtle smell, but look at this picture.  Yes, it's of a high school cheerleading team.  And what are you feeling?  All right.  Smell this.  All right.  There's two gone.  Okay.  One more.  One more. 
[01:18:30]  Okay.  Here.  Open up this little yearbook.  Now, look.  Yeah, you see that.  Okay.  It is the drill team.  Right.  Now, you're feeling.  What are you feeling?  Yeah.  Arousal.  Okay.  Here.  It's a very faint scent.  Oh, what a creep that guy was.  Feeling arousal.  My arousal.  My arousal.  Yuck.  Has gone down very much. 
[01:19:00]  Very much.  Very much with that.  John was molested by his uncle and went on to molest his girlfriend's grandchildren.  Ah, the circle of life.  It is the circle of life.  Oh, are we a bunch of ghouls?  The circle of life.  Why don't we talk about that circle of life, huh?  I touched you, Simba. 
[01:19:30]  You will go on to talk.  Ah, yes.  It is.  All right.  Get that queued up.  We're going to replay.  Grandchildren and grandparents are standing in a circle like a bunch of elephants with the  trunks.  People are suggesting I drink that airborne stuff.  I don't know if that works.  No.  Emergency is better.  I don't even know if the creators know if it works.  They've sold a lot.  They sure have. 
[01:20:00]  The crying king.  Very good.  What's that, Danny?  All right, Iraq, you ready?  Me and you.  Me and you working together.  Here we go.  My arousal has gone down very much.  Arousal dazzle.  John was molested by his uncle and went on to molest his girlfriend's grandchildren.  In the circle of life.  In the world of life. 
[01:20:30]  Yes.  It certainly is.  I like turtles.  You use your tongue prettier than a $20 whore.  Ah, the circle of life.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  John was molested by his uncle and went on to molest his girlfriend's grandchildren. 
[01:21:00]  He went to prison for more than eight years.  Now he's out and working to stay out.  The individual showed quite a significant rise in the penile trace.  Offenders like him put on this gauge, like a lie detector for their genitals, showing how 
[01:21:30]  much images of children.  It's lying.  A lie detector.  Come on now.  If it's false, a light lights up.  And if it's true, you have to wipe the floor off.  I'm thinking more Pinocchio.  Oh, man.  Okay.  So you can picture what this thing does.  Oh, look.  A commercial for the Lion King on television.  What a coinkydink. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  You can picture how this thing works.  Sure.  It kind of looked like a circular ring.  Sure.  And it looked like it was hooked up to a seismograph.  And it would measure certain things.  Wouldn't that be intimidating enough where if you were shown something that you weren't  supposed to be aroused by, that you're kind of thinking that?  I don't know.  I guess not for these guys.  Than?  No?  Why are you asking Than?  Oh, it's the opposite effect.  Well, Than was coming over.  Oh, oh, oh. 
[01:22:30]  I like giving him a little preface like, Than.  He's walking up to the mic.  I'm a mic fan.  Wait.  So what happens after you got this thing on?  Well, I think.  They show you pictures and then what happens?  If you get.  I guess that gauges.  If you get a reaction.  It probably gauges what we like to call the twitch.  You know?  Do they zap you?  No.  They're using smells.  They're using smell.  Oh, we're not to the smell part yet?  No.  Oh. 
[01:23:00]  Offenders like him put on this gauge like a lie detector for their genitals.  Showing how much images of children arouse them and how to stop it.  Women must just hate us.  Like this reporter having to do this is probably like, this is disgusting.  We have to put a ring around men so they could gauge how aroused they are.  And then they show him like some pictures that you would get arrested for.  These guys are getting like a free ticket. 
[01:23:30]  Free show?  Free show.  It's probably not that graphic.  I bet it's probably like really subtle.  Frolicking pictures.  Yeah.  Pictures of frolicking.  Frolicking.  Why is he out of jail?  These guys just creeps.  Eight years.  He should still.  Of course he should.  Grandchildren.  He should be.  He's currently in jail having his teeth kicked in.  That's where he should die.  Once you molest grandchildren, you should never get out.  There should be one smell therapy he's getting.  Yes.  And it's that awful scent of when someone's done. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Or it smells like that hair product that certain ethnic groups will use as your face is in their pillow.  Well, this is just in.  The gauge is just a pair of sweatpants.  Want to hear more?  Of course.  We can't stop now.  He sees his arousal as its beginning and he can learn to identify the physiological changes, the feelings that go along with very low levels. 
[01:24:30]  Psycho.  Babble.  Babble.  This guy needs something hooked up to him and people need something hooked up to him so they can judge and gauge if this guy's being turned.  If this guy even needs this, there's a problem.  There's a problem.  They have the highest recidivism rate.  They always reoffend.  Yeah.  They just, you cannot rehabilitate kid touchers.  That's not, you know what?  You can't.  Gouge their eyes out. 
[01:25:00]  No, because they don't.  So then they cannot see.  Everyone.  They can still like hold out candy and go, anybody hungry?  And someone will show up.  They just shouldn't get out of jail.  People are trying to figure out what the smell is and the smell therapy.  Let's go to Jared.  Jared.  Jared.  Hey.  How you doing, guys?  Thanks.  How about Erock's breath?  I think they don't turn anybody.  Oh, no.  That's, even though these guys are awful people, you know, there is a line.  Cruel and unusual punishment is not allowed in this country, sir. 
[01:25:30]  I love that they'll never forget.  Erock, that's very hurtful of that teasing you with it.  I don't go for that.  Thank you.  I like the phone.  Let's go to Jeff in Chicago.  Jeff in Chicago, who used to listen to us on WCKG.  What's up, Jeff?  Hey, man.  That ring device that used, it shows like a seismograph.  That's the same thing that Bret Michaels used on Rock of Love. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, they hooked Bret Michaels up to this thing.  Oh, to see if he was getting any kind of.  And then he had the girls, like, doing phone sex.  That's cool.  Yeah.  That's it.  All right.  So it's that.  I guess you're right.  I guess it's that device.  So, all right, let's find out more here.  He sees his arousal as its beginning, and he can learn to identify the physiological changes,  the feelings that go along with very low levels of arousal, and intervene there.  Intervene with a sudden fright.  Stop! 
[01:26:30]  With cayenne pepper in their mouths, with the smell.  What was that?  Tablespoonful of cinnamon.  But what was the stop?  Yeah, you say stop.  In the name of inappropriate love.  It might have been just a soundbite for the, uh, us.  I think it was just a soundbite for the piece.  Oh.  In there.  Intervene with a sudden fright.  Stop!  With cayenne pepper in their mouths, with the smell of liquid roadkill so foul, some offenders become ill. 
[01:27:00]  An association now of revulsion, fear, anxiety, aversion.  This is Clockwork Orange.  Yeah.  This is a Clockwork Orange, uh, where they, what a genius Anthony Burgess was to write this.  They held him up, if you haven't seen Clockwork, they opened his eyes and they gave him an experimental drug, the Ludovico treatment.  Yes.  And, uh, they made him watch videos of violence and rape, and the drug affected him, uh, adversely. 
[01:27:30]  So in real life, when confronted with sex or violence, he would want to puke.  Yeah.  That's exactly what this is.  That's what they're trying to do.  Uh, yeah.  They're trying to make it so that when he does see something inappropriate that, uh, arouses him, he will then link that with the roadkill and, um, the cayenne pepper and, uh, not be aroused.  Will not work.  I don't think so.  Unless you take every child in his neighborhood and hang a dead albatross around his neck. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, you got the parents hanging roadkill from their kids as they go off to school.  How about this?  If you don't know, like, if you can't control yourself from molesting a kid, I don't understand how, like, the taste of pepper is going to stop you.  It's not going to stop you.  Yeah.  Mmm.  Exactly.  I always wondered what one of these would taste like with a little pepper.  Let's say hi to John in Staten Island.  Staten Island is, uh, it's a weird place in the New York area that, uh, we don't know much about.  Yes.  Really?  What is this?  Staten Island, I think they... 
[01:28:30]  Like Land of the Lost?  I think they do science experiments over there.  Oh.  Something's going on with Staten Island.  I drive through it every once in a while and, uh, it scares me.  Not very quickly.  It seems like the sun never shines.  One highway-ass island.  It's just, uh, the sun doesn't shine on Staten Island.  No.  Watch.  Go drive there today.  You'll see.  Nothing but clouds.  I don't really shine on much anywhere today.  I know.  That's why I picked today to do that bit.  Uh, John, what's up?  You know, all of this sounds just like the crap they did in the 50s with all the people  that were gay.  You know, electroshock therapy, this bad. 
[01:29:00]  It doesn't work.  How'd that work out?  Well, for me, it didn't work too well.  But, uh, I don't know about anything else.  Wah-na-pah-pah-pah-pah.  Did they really do that back in the day?  Yeah, they were used to put the stupid things, you know, all of my thoughts.  Yeah, you know how they had to do that.  Wow.  We must try to cure the homosexuals with smell therapy.  Although the worse the smell, the more gay they got.  All right, John.  Thank you. 
[01:29:30]  Let's say hi to Scott in Boston listening on BCN.  What's up, Scott?  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Good morning.  Good morning.  This lady sounds like the perv whisperer.  You ever seen that dog whisperer show?  Back.  Yeah.  She's, like, uh, treating them like the, like the dogs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She sounds just like the perv whisperer.  Like the dogs they are.  Yeah.  All right, Scott.  See ya.  Come ill.  An association now of revulsion, fear, anxiety, aversion.  So that the deviant stories and the deviant thoughts and the images of children or aggression 
[01:30:00]  become a turn off rather than a turn off.  Yeah, you know, excuse me.  They know other schools, too, and can carry their own bottles of rotting meat to help  out when they're not at the clinic.  Oh, my God.  Rotting meat.  I need to smell rotting meat.  I'm by your school.  Shouldn't the aversion.  You're driving by, I know you're trying.  It's the visual.  You're driving by the school.  You're starting to get that urge.  No.  You're trying to get the lid of the jar off.  You're opening up your glove compartment, trying to find your rotting meat vial. 
[01:30:30]  Shouldn't the aversion and anxiety have come from the eight years you spent in prison?  Yes.  Shouldn't that be enough to make you think, hey, I shouldn't be doing this.  Last time I did, I spent eight years in prison.  Is this Portland, Oregon?  Yeah.  It figures.  Very open-minded, very liberal, free-form kind of.  Try to cure the animal. 
[01:31:00]  That's where you go for animal sex, too, by the way.  Portland, Oregon?  I think so, right?  Isn't it Oregon?  It's Washington, Pacific Northwest.  People love having sex with animals in the Pacific Northwest.  Can I say that?  I think I can.  I think at this point, psychology shouldn't be offered as a major in college.  It figures it's Portland.  It just figures.  Yeah.  What?  I don't know.  Fans coming very close today. 
[01:31:30]  Missed it?  No, it is funny.  They get confused and pitch a tent every time they drive by a landfill.  Let's go to Jason in Carolina.  Jason.  Hey, guys.  I love you.  Love the show.  Yeah.  Hey, one of the movies we're showing these guys is two kids, one sippy cup.  Oh, wow.  That's funny.  Very good, bro.  A lot of Boston calls today. 
[01:32:00]  What's up with that?  Go, Pats.  Go.  What's up, Paul?  Hey, Paul R. Nelson, the opponent, funded that test.  Linger longer.  Yeah.  Do we have that old Paul R. Nelson commercial where he accuses?  He accuses a...  No, was he the...  Is he being accused or was he accused?  No, he was accusing.  No, he was accusing.  That's right.  Because Paul R. Nelson was the upstanding citizen.  He was accusing the other guy of the Eskimo stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  Paying for all kinds of sexual testing.  It's worth playing.  Before we go to break here. 
[01:32:30]  He even wanted to pay for electrodes.  Remember that?  Oh, yeah.  Why don't we talk to John here.  John says treatment videos help a lot as well.  This is the creepy guy with the voice.  This is the creepy guy.  I've been waiting for you, child molester.  Staying out of prison is strong.  What was that?  That was a clip from one of these videos that they make them watch as part of therapy.  It's just some guy in like a jail cell. 
[01:33:00]  He's like mopping and he goes,  Hey, I've been waiting for you, child molester.  Child molester.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  How does this work?  It doesn't.  Are you kidding me?  It doesn't because the guy goes to beat you up and you're like,  I saw your movie.  And then he likes you.  You are great.  Hey, you're famous.  I really felt the fear.  I've been waiting for you, child molester.  Staying out of prison is strong motivation for John,  who describes real prison much like this treatment video he had to watch again and again. 
[01:33:30]  Uh-oh.  I know a dozen guys in here just cut your throat as soon as they look at you.  While I was in prison, I was attacked by a group of people who didn't like sex offenders.  Yeah.  Oh, damn them.  This needs to be spiced up a little bit.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on, please.  A little spice.  A little cayenne pepper.  A little cayenne pepper.  A little cayenne.  A little liquid roadkill.  Yeah.  A little vial of dead meat.  I'm scared of you. 
[01:34:00]  Rotting meat.  Of course, dead meat would be dead.  Yeah.  It was silly of me to even suggest that.  I've been waiting for you, child molester.  Staying out of prison is strong motivation for John,  who describes real prison much like this treatment video he had to watch again and again.  I know a dozen guys in here just cut your throat as soon as they look at you.  While I was in prison, I was attacked by a group of people who didn't like sex offenders.  Okay, I was going to use screwdrivers, ice picks, and a few handmade guns. 
[01:34:30]  I have a steel eye socket, a steel cheekbone, screws in my face.  I've been waiting.  My opinion on going back to jail is very much,  it isn't going to happen, no matter what I have to do.  He and other sex offenders get extra intervention through these videos,  alternating a fantasy story with horrifying images,  like castration surgery and a victim splashing a sex offender's face with acid. 
[01:35:00]  Now John is through with his treatment.  He believes he's reached a new stage in his life where he is healthy and happy.  I'm cured, my brother.  Working and paying taxes, but like an addict,  always ready to watch for the need to intervene.  If you're not honest with yourself deep inside,  then you can't make any changes.  Once you're molesting kids, you will always be a kid toucher.  That's it.  There's no walking away from that.  It's been proven. 
[01:35:30]  He's doing less time than guys who committed armed robbery,  where all of us could say go to a bank and rob it.  Those guys get more time than a guy who molests his girlfriend's grandchildren.  Yeah.  How is that?  Well, there you go.  That seems a little weird.  It will work.  You think that's working at all?  Yeah, until somebody who they do it on murders a kid.  There'll be something like that,  and then they'll just scrap the whole stupid,  progressive idea of rehabilitating these animals. 
[01:36:00]  All that said to me,  especially that creepy guy when he said,  you know, I won't go back to prison.  I'll do whatever it takes.  That doesn't mean sniffing roadkill.  That means killing the child so they won't say anything.  Right, exactly.  That's the first thing that popped into my mind  when that creep said that.  You know who I feel sorry for?  Let me think.  The...  Iraq.  No.  No?  Never.  Uh, the roadkill on the side of the road. 
[01:36:30]  Uh, yes.  Being just sniffed upon by some aroused child creep.  Haven't they suffered enough?  They just want to cross the highway.  Oh, much better now.  Could you direct me to a dead squirrel, please?  I'm feeling aroused.  I have an ache.  Yes, my sensor is going off.  I need some rotting meat. 
[01:37:00]  I'm fresh out.  Wouldn't you just not shower ever?  Where do you get that, too?  Do you have to get a prescription?  Do they have that at Rite Aid?  You're a pedophile?  Pick up two vials of rotting meat.  Oh, one of those.  Keep the kids away.  They're online at Dwayne Reed,  just whistling along to the museum.  Yeah.  I phoned in a prescription last night for the rotting meat.  Right.  Do you have that?  The guy in the back is trying to shove a squirrel into a pill bottle. 
[01:37:30]  It just doesn't work.  This reminds us of an old clip for the people that linger longer.  An anti-Ron Kind commercial by Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson, our favorite candidate.  We were backing Paul R. Nelson,  who, by the way, didn't have a chance in hell of winning.  Yeah, our own fans wearing Paul R. Nelson's shirt today.  What a coinkydinky.  Paul R. Nelson.  Again.  Sorry.  Oh, no.  That was a dumb joke anyway. 
[01:38:00]  Damn it.  All right.  We're running late.  But you stopped.  We're running late.  But Paul R. Nelson, this is how he was fighting his campaign.  Ten years ago, liberal lawyer Ron Kind was elected to Congress,  and he's done almost nothing in the Congress since.  And that's a good thing, because just about everything he's tried to do has been wrong.  Ron Kind voted to take the words under God out of the Pledge of Allegiance.  He voted to strip the Ten Commandments from our public buildings.  Ron Kind repeatedly voted for gay marriage 
[01:38:30]  and to force the Boy Scouts to accept homosexual leaders.  He even voted to let illegal aliens burn the American flag.  For Congress, Ron Kind is the wrong kind.  The right kind of Congressman is Paul R. Nelson.  Better music.  This former Marine is a father of four who supports Wisconsin values.  Paul R. Nelson will work to stop illegal immigration,  to end our dependence on foreign oil,  to win the war on terror,  and to defend traditional marriage. 
[01:39:00]  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  And I approve of this answer.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I forgot about that one.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  He is fantastic, too.  I love the music.  It's like T2.  Come with me if you want to live.  We miss Paul R. Nelson.  Here's the one about the sex stuff.  With our servicemen and women facing death every day,  what kind of congressman would try to gut military spending? 
[01:39:30]  The wrong kind.  Ron Kind.  That's right.  Congressman Ron Kind is repeatedly voted to deprive our troops of the funding they need to fight for us.  But Ron Kind has no trouble spending your money.  He would just rather spend it on sex.  That's right.  Instead of spending money on cancer research,  Ron Kind voted to spend your money to study the sex lives of Vietnamese prostitutes.  Instead of spending money to study heart disease,  Ron Kind spent your money to study the masturbation habits of old men.  Ron Kind spent your tax dollars to study something called the bisexual, 
[01:40:00]  transgendered, and two-spirited Aleutian Eskimos, whoever they are.  Ron Kind even spent your tax dollars to pay teenage girls to watch pornographic movies  with probes connected to their genitalia.  Ron Kind pays for sex, but not for soldiers.  If Ron Kind had better priorities, you wouldn't be having to hear this.  Ron Kind is out of touch, and soon he'll be out of Congress.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I approve of this message.  And, meanwhile, Ron Kind won by a landslide.  We still get our sex studies. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  Thank God.  Paul Nelson got nine votes.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  We talked to Paul R. Nelson.  He loved us.  Yeah.  He loved what we were doing for him, but it didn't help.  It didn't help at all.  Of course not, because no one's buying into the fact that a guy would rather...  A guy's doing this, like, instead of giving money to shrooms, like, anybody would do that.  Like, anyone that wants to succeed in politics would do that.  And I like how he said in the other ad that he voted to let illegal immigrants burn the American flag. 
[01:41:00]  Right.  It's like, you don't quite vote for that.  No.  You vote for the freedom to allow expression of burning the American flag.  It's a very controversial subject, but you don't vote,  I want illegal immigrants to be able to burn that flag.  Where do I sign?  Get me the 20 pens that I need to sign this bill.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I paid for this. 
[01:41:30]  Paul R. Nelson's a douche.  I can't wait till those spots start up again.  Oh, no kidding.  All right.  I love the election mudslinging.  Hey, during the break, someone on the show or associated with the show, might have slipped there,  got engaged.  Yes.  Yep.  And we'll reveal that next.  Wow.  On Opie and Anthony.  Listen to what?  The ad, Paul R. Nelson's ad.  He's apparently got dumped out of twice.  So you people listening on terrestrial radio. 
[01:42:00]  But that ad ran on TV.  I know it did.  It's a real political ad.  I know.  It's not a parody of a political ad that was put together for some wacky radio station.  Truth, funnier than fiction.  Just that ad run by itself as it ran on television.  We didn't elaborate on anything.  We weren't sitting here giggling because we know the rules.  We sit with lawyers.  We know what we're supposed to do and not supposed to do when we run a piece like that. 
[01:42:30]  It runs on its own merit.  It's outrageous and funny enough to just listen to and laugh.  So we're not going to chuckle and pick up on the parts that could get us in trouble if we elaborated on it.  It holds its own.  Why not just let it run?  Why would a political ad that ran have to be dumped out of on our show? 
[01:43:00]  Because that's bizarre.  Because that's what white males want to listen to.  It's just bizarre to me.  We're fighting for our lives on regular radio and getting absolutely no help.  I'm not going to sit here.  It's amazing to me.  This is what guys listen to.  I'm not going to sit here and blame anyone or say what's this or that, but I just want an answer.  I really want a logical answer that explains to me why a political ad that ran on television ad nauseum, believe me, they played that over and over again. 
[01:43:30]  Because they loved it.  It was entertainment.  Why?  I think you got free ads.  I'm talking on TV.  But I'm saying, I think even the TV stations decided, wow, this ad's too good.  It's too funny.  I know they only paid for 10, but we got to play this 20 times.  Like, why?  Is it real?  And honestly, and I'm talking to anybody in management that's listening or a lawyer that's listening.  Honestly, think about this honestly. 
[01:44:00]  Do you see a complaint coming in that would be entertained by the FCC of us playing a political ad that ran on television in the way we were doing it, in the proper way we were doing it, playing it and goofing on the ridiculousness of the commercial itself, the whole thing, the whole piece.  We weren't picking it apart.  Do you honestly think, based on all the previous finds that have been doled out over the years, that that would be something that would be entertained? 
[01:44:30]  Nope.  Just stop.  We've all read the transcripts of stuff that's gotten people in trouble.  It's not even close.  Come on now.  Yeah, we're rough.  Well, you know what, though?  I mean, because we are targeting males.  That's who we kind of want to get to listen.  And I have fought very hard, and I found out that we are now allowed to say the word tushy.  Whoa.  Now, I don't want to get too many guys crazy, but we can now say tushy on the radio. 
[01:45:00]  Get ready for some edgy talk, fellas.  This just in.  Tushy's off the list.  Oh, no.  Oh, jeez.  She.  I got to say it that way.  She.  She.  She.  You.  Idiot.  Bit.  Suck.  I don't know.  Just bleeping everything I say.  It's safer that way.  Ah, well, maybe we'll get to the bottom of that. 
[01:45:30]  Maybe we won't.  Probably won't.  We never get to the bottom of any of this stuff.  Nope.  It's always vague.  Oh, we shouldn't have dumped, or I'll look into it.  Well, yesterday the dump shouldn't have happened, and I guarantee you one of those shouldn't.  We'll have a meeting to see what we can work out, and then have to sit there and listen to why we can't do anything.  That was ridiculous, though.  That one, like, there are even some things.  I really take the other side on a lot of things.  Not take the other side, but I really try to think of the other side when they dump certain things or tell us that we can't say certain things, and I really think about it. 
[01:46:00]  You've seen in the meetings that we've had with lawyers, I sit there, and I entertain what they say, and I really try to look at their mindset.  There is no way that political ad we just played should have had anything taken out of it.  I'm sorry.  It shouldn't have.  What about the work being taken out of the rundown?  Did they show the picture, at least?  I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know.  I just don't get it.  I understand the need for safety and the fact that the fines have been increased so much. 
[01:46:30]  They want protection from that.  They want to protect the license.  We've been known in the past to be very loose cannons, so they've got to keep an eye on us.  I understand all that, but take into consideration what we're doing and really listen.  If we're playing a political ad that aired all over television without a problem, and it's played in that context, and we didn't elaborate on any of the parts that could have been interpreted as dirty, then it should have just played. 
[01:47:00]  I defy anyone to tell me the FCC would have come down on that.  I just had the same argument with the dump guy, and he was like, well, it's not a current news story.  It doesn't matter.  Of course it doesn't matter.  Of course it doesn't matter.  Did you talk to Tom, too?  He has to listen to it. 
[01:47:30]  I talked to the guy that dumped it.  All right, well.  There we go.  That's our daily, oh, what the hell did they dump portion of the program.  We'll move on to more edgy radio for everybody.  Yeah.  We're going to make fun of, what group are we still out to make fun of?  White men.  White guys.  Dumb white men.  Yeah.  They're so stupid in commercials.  You see the one where the woman's washing the windows, and the guy's out back barbecuing, 
[01:48:00]  and her girlfriend comes over, and she points out the window like, there he is trying to do something,  and he pretty much blows himself up doing the barbecue and set his own on fire.  What a dumb white man.  How stupid white men.  Don't write any letters, guys.  We're just joshing.  We're just kidding with you.  Oh, they got the littlest s*** you ever want to see, too.  Oh, tiny little s***.  There's nothing there. 
[01:48:30]  White men.  They talk funny.  They walk funny.  Oh, they can't drive.  Oh, what dummies.  They built things that sent people to the moon.  Oops.  That's Ronnie B's thing.  I love that.  Hey, yeah.  Oh, we did nothing.  Oh, that's right.  We sent people to the moon.  But that is like doing nothing.  Yeah, of course.  Didn't really accomplish anything.  This thing and age.  They brought back some rocks.  What did we get, Tang out of that? 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  I think.  You might notice, though.  I've turned a corner.  I just don't care.  I appreciate seeing that.  I really don't care, because I know.  Like, ah!  But I have to add this much, because I know in the end we'll be just fine,  no matter what happens.  I don't care.  Well, don't get too edgy.  I don't care.  Don't we have an announcement to make?  They win.  I have no more fight in me.  Steve from Bayshore, I really don't mind them doing some editing if the material is really 
[01:49:30]  questionable.  I try to push it sometimes, but some of the things they take out are bizarre and unoffensive.  Steve from Bayshore does the show rundown.  Right.  It's just a little odd.  Everyone is, it's, they're way overcautious.  Yeah.  And coming from us, I know they probably go, oh, look, they think it's overcautious.  Y'all are being overcautious.  Relax a little bit.  Relax.  We're trying to promote onaradio.com, and then we get, like, watered-down versions of 
[01:50:00]  edgy stuff.  So, I don't know.  Can't be offensive.  Whatever.  Can't be offensive.  The more you tighten your grip, the more edgy material will squeeze through your fingers.  You guys know what you're doing, right?  Yeah.  Of course you do.  Look at the ratings.  Star Wars.  It's obvious.  Hey, we're going to play the bleep game.  I guess we could still do this, right?  Danny, uh...  No, we don't.  What?  They'd still be able to read Steve's uncensored rundown at meatspin. 
[01:50:30]  Ah, you wacky people.  Hey, uh, we're doing the beep game.  Danny, uh, put a nice one together here.  All righty.  I love these.  Yeah, so do we.  So do we.  So do we.  It's just terrific for everybody.  It certainly is.  Danny, what'd you do here?  Oh, I just found it.  This is not my work.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I wish I put it together, believe me.  Where's it from?  It's just one of those random internet videos that's going around. 
[01:51:00]  So I thought it was...  Oh, my God.  I thought you sobered up during the holiday.  Oh, my God.  This is amazing how good this thing is.  Why would I do that?  I was like, wow.  Must have worked for hours on this one.  Danny did some quick rehab over the break.  Because his work has drastically improved.  How did he do that when he was playing Call of Duty 4?  I worked.  Not just not for this show.  I worked for my alcoholism.  No, this really is funny. 
[01:51:30]  Here it is.  Whatever.  Doesn't need a setup.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  You know that I am called the Count.  Because I really love to c**t.  Sometimes I sit and c**t all day.  But, uh, sometimes I get carried away. 
[01:52:00]  I c**t slowly, slowly, slowly getting faster.  Once I start in c**tting, it's very hard to stop.  Hey!  Faster, faster.  It is so exciting.  I c**t f**k forever.  F**k until I drop.  One, two, three, four.  One, two, three, four.  One, two, three, four.  One, two.  I love f**king whatever the amount.  One, two, three, four.  Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:52:30]  Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.  One, two, three, four.  One, two.  That's the song of the Count.  I c**t the spiders on the wall.  I c**t the cobwebs in the hole.  I c**t the candles on the shelf.  When I'm alone, I c**t myself. 
[01:53:00]  I c**t slowly, slowly, slowly getting faster.  Once I start in c**tting, it's very hard to stop.  Faster, faster.  It is so exciting.  I c**t f**k forever.  F**k until I drop.  One, two, three, four.  One, two, three, four.  One, two, three, four.  One, two.  I love f**king whatever the amount.  One, two, three, four.  Hey, yeah, yeah.  One, two, three, four. 
[01:53:30]  One, two, three, four.  Oh, the Count.  That's all right, huh?  Wow.  I like that.  Good one.  You all know what we're getting at, right?  No.  No?  I didn't get it, but some people seem to enjoy it.  Guy likes the Count, apparently.  Yeah.  He sure does.  Oh, why bother at this point? 
[01:54:00]  Well, that's kind of racist, though, because the Count, I think, is unfairly portraying  a Transylvanian, and I want to apologize to any Transylvanian Americans that may have  been offended by that.  That was Transylvanian?  I don't know.  Sounded like the Count was a little Jewish.  Oh, maybe?  Okay.  Yatta, yatta, yatta, yatta, yatta, yatta, yatta.  By the way, Blue Heeler from Kentucky writes, spiders should have been beeped in the beginning.  Yeah, I was thinking that, too.  Anything with the errs ending is very funny to beep. 
[01:54:30]  We've learned that.  Yeah.  Why don't we step aside for a bit?  Who got engaged?  That's what we've got to find out.  Now, come on with this tease.  I didn't want to do it right after beating up corporate.  I didn't want to take someone's thunder.  Yeah, it's an oppi moment.  We're looking at marriages and engagements with this show, and knowing what the divorce 
[01:55:00]  rate is.  On the show?  On the show, there's a couple of people that, they're getting divorced.  They have to.  Statistically, it's just going to happen.  That would be Travis and Iraq, obviously.  Are they married?  They should be.  Less of a ruse than Travis is trying to pull off. 
[01:55:30]  We all know he's gay.  Just stop already.  Travis, you almost got beat up at a Best Buy?  Oh, no, at an Ikea.  All right, we'll talk about that after the break.  Hilarious.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony with you on your radio dial.  On your radio dial.  Hope you're hanging in there, having a good morning.  Whatever you're getting ready to do.  Yeah. 
[01:56:00]  Jimmy fighting our battles during the commercials.  You must be tired.  Well, you're getting a workout running down the hall at every break.  I will credit Tom.  Tom said that it should not have been dumped, and this is the third dump in a row that Tom  kind of backed us on.  Which, look, I understand these things happen, but it just makes you feel better.  Like, all right, we're not stupid.  Yeah, I think, uh...  I think Dump Guy might need another little talking to from some people.  Perhaps a little training.  I think they kind of throw weird rules at him, too. 
[01:56:30]  Like, he's like, oh, what about this?  Like, there's always these different rules every day.  Oh, the whole thing's a mess, man.  I don't know what to do.  But they're throwing out the baby with the bathwater.  Yeah.  I have no idea.  I just used to hear it.  You're a friend, baby Americans.  Don't dump that.  Baby Americans.  You know, why did that become a saying?  Throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  That just means that somewhere in history, someone was dumb enough to do that.  Could do that?  Like, ah, where did the baby go?  I made it.  No, what happened was somebody needed... 
[01:57:00]  Somebody was throwing a baby out, and then somebody yelled, why are you wasting all that  bathwater?  Just pick the kid up and get rid of it.  Sling and a miss.  Oh, and...  Sound effect helped, though.  Yeah.  Hey, Travis.  I gotta hear this story.  Yeah, Travis almost got beat up or something at Ikea.  Yeah.  Who gets into a fight at Ikea?  Nobody, except, you know.  You're all fighting over that $100 couch.  Are you and your life partner shopping? 
[01:57:30]  Oh, honey, a plastic coffee table.  We need one of those.  We bought all of our furniture.  Do you get it?  Their stuff is cheap.  It certainly is.  So you're at Ikea?  Yeah, we're at Ikea, because we just moved into a new apartment.  So you gotta go to Ikea.  Yeah, so, you know, we need everything.  Yeah.  It's the poor man's furniture store.  Yeah, it really is.  Where you put it together yourself.  Oh.  With pins and twisty latches and not enough Allen keys.  That's all we did. 
[01:58:00]  But it looked like wood on the box.  And it's pressed wood.  Oh, the press board.  The press board, yeah.  Who hasn't yelled, it's stripped!  It's stripped out!  And then you got that one little latch that keeps turning and turning.  Little screw.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I had a couple of those.  You gotta watch that.  So we bought a lot of stuff.  So we rented a U-Haul van to bring it back from Long Island, because we went to the one  out on Long Island.  And so we're carrying all of our stuff out to the, you know how they have kind of like 
[01:58:30]  a loading area?  Yes.  Where you have to bring your car from the parking lot.  Oh, yeah.  And there's only certain amounts of spots.  So a lot of people are holding spots, waiting, you know, for somebody to go get the car.  So we get all of our stuff out there, and I'm about to go to get the U-Haul, and this  guy pulls in to the spot that my wife is holding.  Uh-oh.  And she doesn't, uh, she likes to speak her mind.  She doesn't, she's not as diplomatic as she probably should be under certain circumstances. 
[01:59:00]  Exactly.  Yeah.  So, uh, the guy gets out of the car.  What'd she say to him?  Like, like, like, she's standing in the spot?  She's standing outside of the spot.  Like, kind of like, uh, on the sidewalk.  We have what she said.  You.  So now she's outside the spot.  So she's only to get your car.  You're still there? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  I'm, I'm maybe like 10 feet away.  And then I hear her start telling this guy.  Can I stop you for one second?  I hope the women that are listening right now are listening very carefully.  Yeah.  Because we're going to teach you something today.  We're not as tough as you think, as you think we are.  Look at me.  Right.  Go ahead.  Continue.  So, uh, so she starts telling this guy, you know.  Probably thought you were a lamp.  So she tells this guy, you know, this is our spot where we're, he's going to get the van.  And he's like, I'm just going to be a minute. 
[02:00:00]  I'm just going to be a minute.  I'm loading my stuff in.  She's like, that's what these spots are for so that we can load our stuff in.  You have to wait just like everyone else.  And he's like, I'm just going to be a minute.  I'm just going to be a minute.  And he's being rude to her.  Um, he was being very short with, well, the guy is being a tool.  I'll give you that.  Well, why would he pull in there?  If you're already like waiting, you got to wait your turn.  Exactly.  And she's showing, she's like, look, see other people are holding their spots.  She's like, this isn't just something, you know, like we're doing.  Yeah.  Let me ask one quick question.  The devil's advocate. 
[02:00:30]  It was his stuff ready to go.  And he had his car there while you still had to go get yours.  Yes.  So maybe on a technicality, you were right, but she's probably shouldn't engage the guy.  If his stuff, you know why?  Because there would have been a problem.  Let me tell you something quickly.  Won't interrupt your story at all.  I was, um, but you are no, no, I was online at the bank one day and this chick had a tongue.  I can't say online at the bank anymore without thinking that I was online at the bank and  some guy goes, I'm in a big hurry.  Could I please just get in front of you? 
[02:01:00]  And I was like, all right.  Worst thing I could have said, he goes to the window 20 goddamn minutes.  He's trying to like cash drachma or something.  And I'm sitting there.  I could have been done.  So no, you never let anyone in front of you ever.  No, no, no.  I don't even mean that.  I think you're right.  I'm only saying though, because if he had his van,  there, almost like in his stuff in his van, like he was ready to load and go.  What if something was missing?  What if something of his was broken?  Now he's got to talk to the guy about this. 
[02:01:30]  No, no.  You were in line.  You were right.  Of course, a little more diplomacy perhaps, but.  Something was missing.  Travis's muscles.  Any hint of masculinity.  You should have seen me trying to carry some of this stuff.  Oh my God.  What, the styrofoam peanuts?  The packing peanuts?  The bubble wrap?  So everything, everything's kind of fine.  And like, she kind of lets the situation go. 
[02:02:00]  And it, we kind of, you know, give in.  Like, just let this guy do his stuff.  No.  And then she says.  She didn't give in.  Well, she's the only one fighting.  I personally couldn't have cared about it.  Well, Travis is a man and he understands the consequences of dealing with other men.  Yes.  So, everything's fine until she, he turns around and she says, un-effing believable.  And you could see in his eyes he.  Oh.  The switch.  He's got that switch.  And he runs up to her and gets about a foot away from her and starts pointing at her. 
[02:02:30]  Oh!  Say, don't you, you know, effing talk to me like that.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And.  Any good curses?  Yes.  You know what you need?  What?  A gun.  I do need a gun.  If you would have pulled a gun out on him, he'd have shut the eff right up.  Right up!  He was threatening my wife with bodily harm.  Was he threatening her or just yelling back?  Doesn't matter.  That close?  He was way too close. 
[02:03:00]  He was ready to strangle her.  I had to shoot him in the head ten times.  You could tell that he was not the type of person that respected women.  Okay.  Was he on the shelf?  Hello.  Yes.  I need my Ikea furniture, please.  Listen, you.  So I jumped in the middle instinctively.  Of course.  Instinctively.  Come on.  I know.  I'm 125 pounds.  As what?  Prey?  Yeah. 
[02:03:30]  Are you really 125 pounds?  Between 125 and 130.  Aw, that's adorable.  Little guy.  He's got a girlish figure.  So I jumped in his face because, you know, like, it's your chick, you know?  Of course.  You have to.  Now you've been put in a position.  Now you have to because she got you in that position.  All right.  So I'm telling him not to talk to her like that, you know, et cetera, et cetera.  He's saying, you know, she's saying she shouldn't even be talking to begin with.  And she shouldn't be talking.  Yeah.  And she's yelling at him, you know, like the way he thinks. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  She said she shouldn't be talking at all.  At all.  And she says, I'm a grown woman.  MF her.  Blah, blah, blah.  He's like, your husband's about to get his ass kicked.  This and that.  Oh, no.  What a douche.  This guy is nuts.  I see it in his eyes.  I'm like, I'm going to get my ass kicked.  He's like, he's going to knock me out.  I hate this guy.  Yeah.  I don't.  No, I hate this guy.  I don't agree with your wife's tactics here. 
[02:04:30]  I hate this guy, too.  But I hate this guy because if you were a bigger guy, he wouldn't have pulled that crap.  No effing way.  Yes, he would have.  Why?  Was he big?  No, he wasn't.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Wait a minute.  Just tell me if I'm right.  No.  White guy.  Oh.  Shut up.  Well, I've.  Why do you keep telling Jimmy to shut up?  I'm kidding.  I love Jimmy.  No, he was.  Jimmy.  All right.  So, I calm the situation down. 
[02:05:00]  I, you know, assure him that I don't want any trouble.  Oh.  Because, come on, I'm not going to get into a fight.  It's not going to be a fight.  Oh, your wife's not looking at you the same way.  Oh.  Well.  No.  Not, no, not even because.  Oh, that's awful.  At the end.  You got to leave that situation bleeding, missing a few teeth.  Yep.  Now you're, now you're committed.  No, believe it or not.  You have to.  The only thing she was upset about was that I got involved at all. 
[02:05:30]  Because she wanted to see if he was going to hit her.  Yep.  Here's exactly what happened.  That kind of would have been cool.  Then, you know, you could have had his furniture too.  Yes.  That guy's a creep.  You're right.  He's a complete.  He's a ghoul.  He's a bully.  An ass bully.  He is, but he's a nut.  He's a nut.  And I completely fault the woman for saying something.  I like you.  She's a friend of mine.  Yeah.  I completely fault the woman because they get involved on a level.  Like, that guy couldn't hit her.  He wanted to hit her because he's arguing with her.  So he's got to say, your husband's going to get his ass kicked. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, but why did he have to say that?  First of all, he's got no problem with Travis at that point.  He didn't.  Travis is stepping in in defense of his wife.  And then he's like, your husband's going to.  Not even directing it to Travis.  Like, I'm going to kick your ass if you don't keep her in line.  It's, I'm going to.  Your husband's going to get his ass kicked.  How about, how about my husband has a gun?  Oh, you got to get armed.  Armed citizenry.  It's the only way.  The Old West.  It keeps going.  Oh, Christ, no. 
[02:06:30]  So I calm everything down.  I go in to get the last, you know, truckload of furniture that we have waiting inside Ikea.  And he's finishing up.  He was actually very quick.  He's finishing putting his stuff in his truck.  Good for him.  And my wife.  Oh, no.  God bless her.  Oh, no.  Okay, here's where it all turns around to completely her fault.  He's getting in the car.  It's over.  And she says, happy Chinese New Year. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, okay.  That's nice.  But it's not anywhere near there.  He was an Asian.  Oh, okay.  And he gets right out of his car again.  And I turn to him.  I'm like, what the F are you doing?  Oh, no.  He comes right back.  He says, you really want a problem, don't you?  And he's looking at me.  He's not looking at her.  Oh, my God.  And I'm like, I do not want a problem.  I was like, just calm down.  Everything.  I don't know what to say. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, boy.  Because you almost want to go, go ahead, do it.  Do what you got to do.  Because that just did not have to be said.  No, you might have had to just lay him out.  You might have just had to accept the fact that your wife is wrong, but you might have  had to just blindside him with a kick to the groin.  At that point, you close your eyes and hope for the best.  And just get that surprise shot.  As hard as you can.  Because let me tell you, after part one of this, he didn't think you were going to do  anything. 
[02:08:00]  No.  So his guard's down.  You come upside his head and just keep pounding.  You have to.  You left.  Could you go back there and pick up your genitalia?  Because you left it in the parking lot of Ikea.  I disagree.  I don't think Travis did.  Travis is a small guy.  He's not coming off like a tough guy.  The other guy was a jerk, but when a woman runs their mouth at a man, they put you in  that position. 
[02:08:30]  And they do it.  Women do it.  They run their mouth at men because they don't understand the consequences of dealing with  men.  The way this guy dealt with that situation was wrong, though.  As a man, whether he's a nut or not, is wrong.  I've been in that situation with women.  I told the story about the movie theater when that Hispanic woman went into battle mode  because my girlfriend decided to tell her to go F herself because she was making too much  noise.  They're quoting battle mode on instant feedback.  Battle mode.  That's one thing because it's a woman and a woman and they're yelling at each other. 
[02:09:00]  And both of us men were like, the guy just looked at me and went, well, she put her in  battle mode.  And I'm like, all right, it's two women.  What are we going to do?  But when a guy does something like that to a woman, whole nother story, you got to throw  out the window any reason and logic on the part of maybe your wife was wrong and do everything  you can to make sure she's okay and stick up for it, even if it means getting a punch  to the face.  I agree with you.  But like that guy was leaving. 
[02:09:30]  I'm not saying that Travis Hill's wife get hit, but I'm saying like he didn't leave his  genitals anywhere because that guy was leaving.  He was going, when it was all done, he didn't mother eff you on the way out.  Leaving, feeling like he got away with something.  Good for her.  She should have done more.  So what happened?  If he felt like he was getting away with something, he would have crap talked him on the way out.  No.  But he didn't.  He just left.  No, he left really wanting to kick my ass, but not.  You know?  And so she says that. 
[02:10:00]  He comes back.  Every other word is, you know, he's just dropping F-bombs.  You know, you want a problem, I'm going to kick your ass.  This other guy now that was kind of like, you know how Ikea is kind of like a map where  you go around, you know, and everyone, you're kind of going with the same people.  Never been there.  I have no idea what you're talking about, poor person.  Well, this guy, this guy who we were kind of like, you know, shopping near the entire  time.  Now he's out.  And so he is defending me now. 
[02:10:30]  He gets in this guy's face.  Oh.  And this guy just starts yelling at the guy who's defending me.  He's like, you want a problem?  It's like my bodyguard.  Yeah.  This guy was nuts.  He was looking to just fight.  He was a problem.  Someone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And so now he realizes that there's everybody's watching and he gets in his car.  And also, also it's one and a half versus two.  One and a half.  Wait, one and a half versus a versus two.  Oh, my God. 
[02:11:00]  All right, hold.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  See, I should have went one versus one.  Oh, my God.  I got to go back to Betty, bye.  Oh.  No, I'm not even, I know, Travis, you got to defend your woman.  You have to, man.  But it's almost like the fact that a woman, and this is all women that do this, they would  put their man in a position to have to be confrontation.  Like, do you know nothing about the animal kingdom?  No, no, you're right.  You're right.  That should never be done. 
[02:11:30]  But once that line is crossed, you can't go back.  You're past the point of no return.  Patrice told a great story about this.  Now you got to be the guy.  Yeah, but he was the guy.  It doesn't mean punching the guy because he did defuse.  It got defused.  It got defused.  The only reason it got defused, and I'm sorry, Travis, is because Travis completely backed  down to this guy.  So what?  The guy was in his face, and then you get to the point where you're going, I don't  want any trouble.  I don't want any trouble.  It's like, yeah, I know you don't.  Because look at me. 
[02:12:00]  You know, I know, and I'm sorry for your little waif-like body, but it's like, at that point,  you can't think about, oh my God, what she did or said.  You could yell at her when it's done.  Oh, could you yell?  Well, but at that time, you got to defend.  But he did.  He stepped in between them.  But why should I be responsible?  Why should I take a punch for something that she said?  You should give a punch.  I completely agree.  When that guy starts with his effing and this and that and the other thing, bam.  It's tough not to... 
[02:12:30]  You were being assaulted.  Assaulted.  Yeah.  Didn't she yell something racist at the guy on the way into the car when it was over?  What?  Absolutely not.  She wished him a happy new year.  That is true.  What the hell?  That was kind of nice.  What, she's supposed to know what day that is?  It was our new year recently.  What the hell?  Shouldn't she say that?  Women have that protective thing of men are not supposed to hit us.  And they deep down never believe that they will.  They don't understand what they think they do, but they really don't.  They don't.  Chivalry. 
[02:13:00]  There's our music.  And honor.  I don't think Travis lost his...  I think he did the right thing.  He stepped in.  Oh, we lost that years ago.  I'm kidding.  I want to apologize to Than.  Travis blew up his spot.  Oh.  Congratulations.  We're going to XM.  Have a nice day.  Yeah.  Good luck to you.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony. 
[02:13:30]  Good luck to you.  Thank you. 
[02:14:00]  Thank you. 
[02:14:30]  Thank you. 
[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  I shouldn't shoot gum on the air.  Oh, I'm eating apple. It's lovely.  Eating is one thing.  And I got a lozenge in my throat.  I'm ready to slurp down my smoothie.  Although, is someone else getting it, Kenny?  Oh, Travis's story got us all talking during the walkover. 
[02:17:30]  Certainly did.  And I agree with Jimmy wholeheartedly that that would probably cause a little rift between you and your girl.  So, but on the other hand, I think, I don't know, as a guy, you're in, you have no choice.  You got to go into freaking fight mode.  You want to keep from having to do that, you want to keep from having to do that up until the point where you cross that boundary where the guy then confronts your chick.  Then you're obligated as a guy to step in and defend her. 
[02:18:00]  You could use diplomacy at the very beginning to see, like, hey, what's going on here kind of thing.  And maybe that will sort it out or help to bring it about a peaceful ending.  But if the guy's in her face pointing from a foot away yelling at her, you've got to punch him.  It doesn't matter who's right or wrong here.  Also add that the guy got in Travis's face and said something like, you really want a problem. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Travis, I know what you guys are saying, but Travis did step in front of his girl.  He stepped in front of his girl.  Yeah, but stepping in front of, and then the guy threatening him like that.  Yeah, it's, it's, and the only thing, Travis was, he backed down enough where the guy was like, all right, I'm satisfied.  I'm satisfied.  I showed him.  I, you can't let him walk away like that.  That guy should have been decked on the frigging pavement in the Ikea parking lot with his cheesy furniture sitting up on the loading dock. 
[02:19:00]  I disagree because the guy was obviously like, you know how you pick up a sense.  The guy was a problem.  There was something like he's like one of those guys that was going to snap.  And it's almost like you always read stories, and this was an avoidable confrontation.  Yeah.  You read stories about people that get shot over parking spaces.  Sure.  Or like, or stupid Travis would be laying there with a busted jaw, missing teeth.  But he would still have a sex life.  But then his wife's going to go, wow.  But then you sure have something to hold over her head.  Go, look at what I did.  Yeah, then you feel worse. 
[02:19:30]  Like, I tried to stand up for my girl and I got the shit beat out of me.  At least this way you stepped, I think Travis did the right thing.  Because it's not like she said, sir, could you do something, and then the guy motherfucked her.  That's different.  That's 100% different.  Where your rage should come up.  Where you should be in fucking fight mode.  But it wasn't like she was being polite and said, hey, look.  Like, the guy actually, even though he was maybe being a dick, said, I'm just going to be a minute.  And whatever, was running in.  And Travis didn't even have the car yet.  And that guy was a fucking problem.  Because the other guy stepped in and the guy didn't back off.  He was like one of those guys.  Right.  Who the fuck knows what's going on with him? 
[02:20:00]  It's like you've got to think that you're dealing with other men, and the woman provoked it to that point.  And then the guy's going to leave, and he didn't point at Travis and say, fuck you, fat.  He didn't say anything, right?  He was just getting in the truck to go.  He was done.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  You're on.  Poor Travis.  Yeah, you're on.  You nervous Nelly.  I'm not nervous.  Oh, poor Travis.  In three years, I'm not nervous.  Yeah.  Yeah, she.  Yeah, you're not nervous. 
[02:20:30]  Shut up.  No, I'm just, I want to make sure that I get this story correct, because apparently I missed a little part.  Oh, okay.  Clear it up.  Where he came back and started.  With nunchucks?  No.  Yeah, right.  Good.  Now I forgot where we were.  He came back and started with her again while I was inside the Ikea.  Oh.  Now why the fuck did he do that?  I was inside the Ikea.  This little dick motherfucker that just had to have a big day for himself over at Ikea. 
[02:21:00]  And I come back out.  Fuck you.  I come back out, and he's getting into his car, and I said, you know, you really shouldn't talk to women like that.  Yeah.  And he got back out of the car, and tried to, you know, the guy was a problem.  Like Jim keeps saying, he was looking for a fight.  So he keeps, you know, motherfucking me, telling me I'm going to get my ass kicked, et cetera, et cetera.  And the situation calmed down again. 
[02:21:30]  And I don't know how I calmed down the situation, but, like, I didn't want to get into a fight because...  He didn't either, actually.  He would have just punched you in the face.  Bruce Lee or Oddjob?  What body size?  Probably more Bruce Lee.  Yeah?  Yeah, way more Bruce Lee.  This is a culture that shrinks through women's feet.  Right.  So a woman backtalking him, that's a...  Exactly.  I'm not saying he's not a cunt.  The guy is, the guy probably should be backed over.  The guy was fine until she cursed at him.  Like, she didn't say anything, like, until she said, un-fucking-believable, he was fine. 
[02:22:00]  And he didn't say, hey, she didn't say, hey, fuck you.  Yeah.  She just, the situation, un-fucking-believable.  She just said, un-fucking-believable.  And then he's got to get out.  And he said, what did you say?  And she said, it's just unbelievable how some people are in this world.  You want to hear a funny story?  Like, well, how are you doing?  He doesn't know all of a sudden.  Ready for you yet?  Kenny.  Sit there.  Hold tight.  I got it.  All right.  Let it be direct.  Don't worry. 
[02:22:30]  We'll get to you, you dope fucking...  I'm going to get the smoothies.  Like, the smoothies are the most important thing.  When the fans are downstairs freezing.  Well, I'll have Paul go grab him.  He's not doing anything else.  Kenny is an OCD freak, and he's got a list of things that he just constantly needs to check off.  Oh, I know.  And the longer he waits between checking off stuff, he gets freaked out.  Yeah.  And makes him babble and fuck up the whole timing of a radio show.  Yeah.  Kenny.  This big story.  I was like comic relief.  Oh, no. 
[02:23:00]  Without the comic.  And it wasn't relieving at all.  Go ahead, Travis.  All right.  What were you saying before a man interrupted you?  She said that he had spoken to her when you were inside.  Yeah.  And I came back outside, and he was getting into his van, and I told him that he really  shouldn't talk to women like that.  Mm-hmm.  And he got back out of his van and got back into both of our faces, and he said she shouldn't  be talking at all. 
[02:23:30]  And then she said-  At all.  Yeah.  And she said, I'm a grown fucking woman.  I'll talk whenever I want.  Yeah.  She's- I can say whatever I want.  I'm a grown woman.  Which, she's right.  When he said she shouldn't be talking at all, then I knew what I was dealing with.  Oh, maybe he said that because she's Canadian.  Maybe.  Good point.  Why didn't you punch this guy, really?  The guy needed a fist in the face.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  He needed to be blindsided when he was talking and thinking he had it all, because it looks  to me, was he in a posture that looked like he was going to punch? 
[02:24:00]  Absolutely.  You should have fucking wailed him.  Just wail him right in the fucking ear.  Take your-  Just so he goes, bong!  Take your plastic-  Ring his bell.  Plastic furniture and hit him over the head with it.  Yeah.  Maybe I'm not saying you're wrong.  Maybe I should have.  No, I don't think you should have at all.  No.  Oh, you-  No.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's macho to say you should have.  No, I know.  If a guy is physically threatening your woman, you absolutely should bite him. 
[02:24:30]  I'm not saying that you shouldn't ferociously defend the person you're with.  In that situation, I would be so angry at my girl, because if the guy was-  Because that guy was acting like a douchebag.  Not enough.  Because-  More important than they were.  He was more fucking important than they were to get his furniture first.  Fuck him.  You're right.  Fuck everybody that thinks like that, too.  You're more fucking important.  Go fucking screw, man.  You're right.  That guy needed a punch before anyone said a word.  You're right.  Douchebag.  You're looking at it from the point of view of, like, I don't want to be bullied either. 
[02:25:00]  But that guy-  If a guy has a fucking problem, and there are people in the world that are just like that-  Everyone's got problems.  You just-  Travis did the right thing.  Because he would have been laying in the hospital with a broken jaw.  It's stupid.  Or the other guy would have been sitting there going, oh, oh, oh.  With his van spray-painted with fucking symbols he had no one understands.  I hope his grandma gets hit crossing the street somewhere on Mott.  That's a very good-  That's hitting a very personal thing for Anthony.  They're constantly getting run over up there. 
[02:25:30]  Down there.  Kenny, do you have a story?  No.  Hey, Tony, you should ask.  It's kind of anti-climactic, though, after his terrific story.  We're climactic, but climactic.  Whatever.  Whatever.  No, no.  Like, et cetera, et cetera, over there.  Me and Jimmy-  Et cetera, et cetera.  Me and Jimmy had a similar situation, where Jimmy played the role of the woman.  Ah.  Oh, God, please, feel free to-  Let's get this one out on the table. 
[02:26:00]  Go ahead, go.  Oh, shit.  Go ahead.  I look forward to this one.  Yeah, Jimmy's winding up.  Oh, no, God.  All right.  This story has some legs.  Yeah.  No, we were at this club, and Jimmy's been playing these, like, small outer-  Shit houses.  Yeah.  To work on all this new material.  He's got an hour of great material now since his HBO special.  So we were leaving this place, and there was a pizza delivery guy parked in the fire  lane blocking us in. 
[02:26:30]  All right?  I tried to pull out.  I couldn't pull out.  I tried again.  I couldn't pull out.  So I go in the place to look for the guy.  I find the guy.  This is all like, it's in between shows, and we're going to go back to the hotel for a  little while.  I like to go back, relax for a bit, and then come back for the late show.  Sure.  So we're on a time schedule.  Right.  Yeah, the sooner you get back, the more time you have to relax.  Yes, in between shows.  Understand?  So I go in the place, I find a mope, and you got to realize, like, it's like a 40-year-old  loser, probably, like, lives at home with his parents, you know, minimum wage, delivering 
[02:27:00]  pizza.  Yeah.  Fat, ugly.  Nobody.  You know, exactly.  Stuck in this, you know, shithole of a town.  Just miserable.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I went to Jimmy's show.  No, no, he was delivering pizza.  Okay.  Delivering pizzas.  You know.  To the hotel.  I was working in the hotel.  I was working in the hotel.  I was working in pizza.  Yeah.  So I go, look, pal, can you do me a favor?  Are you blocking?  He goes, I'm not blocking anybody in.  So right away, he's, like, arguing.  I'm not blocking.  No, you are.  I go, yeah, I can't get out. 
[02:27:30]  Could you just, are you done?  Could you move?  And he's insisting he's not blocking anybody in.  So, like, probably nobody even, like, talks to this guy other than, like, give him the address to deliver a pizza.  Sure.  So now, like, he's got an audience and he's got a little bit of the upper hand.  So, like, he's busting my chops, like, oh, I can't believe I'm not blocking anybody in.  I know I'm not blocking anybody.  I go, look, you're blocking me in.  So I'm just, like, letting him ramble on because we're walking, like, we're making progress. 
[02:28:00]  Right?  So we get out now and now he proceeds to show me how, like, how stupid I am that I can't get out.  Instead of just moving the fucking car.  Right, right, right, right.  So Jimmy's sitting in the car waiting, all right, and all of a sudden, you know, he just starts screaming at the guy out of the window.  I'll tell you why.  I'll tell you why.  You're forgetting one line here.  All right.  Okay, but I'm the woman.  Meanwhile, this cuckold has been fucking knocked around by the fat pizza guy. 
[02:28:30]  Like, I'm in the truck and I can see the guy's on nobody.  It's not like, because Kenny could murder the guy.  And that annoyed me, too, is that this guy is talking to a guy at Kenny's side with that phony fucking feeling of protection.  Yeah.  Like, he won't hit me because we're civilized.  And Kenny was being polite.  Kenny was being polite.  And then I hear the guy go, well, how could you not back out?  I mean, you're a man.  I could see if you were a woman and you couldn't back out.  But you're a man, aren't you?  That's what he said.  Oh.  And I'm like, would you move the fucking car? 
[02:29:00]  I'd scream from the passenger.  But it wasn't like he was some big guy that Kenny was trying.  He was a fat nobody who was shit-talking Kenny.  Yeah.  And it annoyed me.  I never shit-talked with bigger guys around me.  And I was so aggravated.  And the guy's like, don't curse.  I won't move the car.  And I'm like, oh, that car will fucking move.  Move the fucking car.  That's what I said.  I'll fucking, I'll run this thing.  I'll run it over.  I was so aggravated.  Oh, I hate people.  And the bottom line is, so the guy moved the car.  And then me and the guy just started screaming at each other. 
[02:29:30]  But I wasn't out of the car in the guy's face.  What's he going to do?  I mean, I knew he was going to do nothing.  And it annoyed me.  Just call him a fat fuck?  Yeah.  I think I did, right?  I screamed at him again.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fuck you.  Because then the guy's yelling at me like, if he doesn't shut up, I'm not moving.  But it's not like the guy was being polite and I was just yelling at him.  He was, when he said to Kenny, well, if you see, if you were a woman, you don't know how to draw.  I wanted to fucking smash him.  So nobody was, that, so I'm being the woman.  I'm like, will you fucking, will you untuck your dick and tell him to move that fucking car? 
[02:30:00]  Kenny has a weird sensibility about him.  Because he killed the guy.  Yeah, he lets people, like, when we're driving in the morning, I see people do ridiculous stuff with their cars cutting us off.  And Kenny's just like, oh, look at that guy.  I'm like, look at that guy.  Get out and beat him up.  Kenny has a murderous confidence.  Yeah.  Because he's armed.  Like, I've never, I don't, like, when I'm with Kenny, it's good to have him there and stuff, but I don't fucking.  Is it really?  I mean, personality-wise, it's horrendous. 
[02:30:30]  Right, all right.  It's like dragging a bag of fish around.  Thank you.  Let's finally put it on the table.  Is he really that much fun to be around?  No, no, no, not at all.  It's like bringing, it's like walking.  If you need a cough syrup, he's great.  He's the man.  Let's actually have a one-on-one conversation with about something going on with your, in your life.  No, I agree.  I should be seen and not heard.  But did I ever start a fight with anybody on the road?  Did I ever start?  No.  See, no.  I'm with a big guy who's armed, and I still would never, but that little fat guy.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  And I wouldn't put Kenny in a position where he had to get into a fight, for me, unless the guy started. 
[02:31:00]  Like, if that was a big guy, and they were having that discussion, I mean, I know what Kenny can do.  I would have just fucked.  I never would have shit-talked, but I saw he's this little fat cunt, and it drove me nuts.  So, Kenny, why, sorry, I know you're, why was Jimmy the woman?  No, I was just saying, because, like, he was yelling and antagonizing the guy when, like, I was making progress with the guy.  Progress?  No, the guy didn't deserve for you to make progress.  If his big threat also is, I won't move my car, it wasn't even like, I'm going to kick your ass, or his ass, or something, I won't move the car, that's when you just go, or lift up your jacket for a split second. 
[02:31:30]  Because I'm not ending up in jail.  Not allowed to brandish.  You know, I could have beat that guy to death.  It's illegal, but he's looking.  Yeah.  It comes from the school of who's looking.  And we knew Kenny could beat him to death.  And that guy, whatever he was doing, that phony over, I fucking hated him for that. 
[02:32:00]  Because Kenny wasn't being rude to him.  Yeah.  As polite as Kenny, because the guy was wrong.  Instead of just going, wow, this guy's 6'6", and fucking borderline retarded.  No offense, but people who don't know you think you're retarded.  Yeah.  It's like Lenny from A Pice and Men going, could you move your car?  It was the battle of retards, because that guy was obviously, you know, a little tunch.  Yeah, there's something wrong if he's 40 delivering pizzas.  I think people think that because of the small head, Kenny.  Yeah.  Yeah, no, I got a...  It comes to a point almost. 
[02:32:30]  I got a very small head because I got very little brains in them.  If you had a shaved head, it would be a little creepy for everybody.  Yeah.  The hair makes it look like it's a little bigger up top.  Yeah.  I just don't like...  But that's what drove me nuts, was the way that guy was...  I don't like people that are phony bullies.  It's phony bullies.  I agree.  Bullies are one thing.  Bullies, you can't really fuck with.  You're going to get your ass handed to you.  Absolutely.  And usually it's mano-a-mano kind of a thing.  You know, it's a situation that happens. 
[02:33:00]  When your chick is involved, like I said, all bets are off.  You got to do what you got to fucking do.  But it's not like the guy touched her.  Close enough, dude.  Close enough to fucking spit rice in her face.  Dude, I've been that angry at somebody.  Like, if some woman was doing that and I was in a rage for some reason, man, I would want to yell at her.  Why don't we get Travis's wife on the line?  Okay.  Now, ask Lisa if Travis is leaving something out.  Okay.  What, Ant?  I'm going to go get some smoothies.  Would you...  No, it's a mic call saying menacing is a crime. 
[02:33:30]  Of course it is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Menacing.  Lisa.  Yeah?  What do you got to add to this whole thing?  Okay.  What do I have to add?  Oh, sorry.  It's really...  It's not happening here.  Okay.  Nothing.  I was just going to say, like, this guy was right up in my face.  And yes, I did yell at Travis.  I'm sure he mentioned.  Because I wanted to see if he was going to do anything.  Like, he literally, like Ant said, spitting rice in my face.  Well, hold on.  Hold on.  Right there. 
[02:34:00]  Wait.  You said he yelled at Travis, too?  Yeah, because she didn't want me to get involved.  Right.  She wanted to see if he was going to hit her.  She just said, I wanted to see if he was going to do anything.  So now what she was doing is she is testing another man.  And at what kind of position does that put Travis in?  He has to jump in.  And he did.  But this isn't at the point.  She didn't get out of the car going, I'm going to test the guy today and see if I can  get punched.  He already had started his fucking phony bullshit with her.  Exactly.  But Lisa, when you were pushing him, like, did you not read the fact, like, because 
[02:34:30]  Travis saw the fact that the guy was a problem.  And there are men that are...  There's, like, weird things.  Like, the guy was obviously a fucking...  He was fighting the urge to probably do something really stupid.  Yeah.  Although Travis didn't have a chance to see that he was a problem until he was already  a problem.  Right.  Like, this all happened very quickly.  I was, you know, really polite.  Like, I went up to the car and I was like, sir, you know, we're waiting for this spot.  We're going to pull in.  And he starts flipping out right away.  Like, within 10 seconds, he was in my face.  And Travis was, like, probably about 25 feet away getting a cart to bring over. 
[02:35:00]  So he abandoned the cart and came running.  Like, there was no time for, like, assessing what this guy was going to do.  Was he in your face at first?  Or did he say, I want to...  I'm just going to be a couple of minutes.  And then you were kind of like, when you said, un-fucking-believable, then he got  kind of crazy.  He was about 20 feet from me when I, like, looked at...  I was kind of looking in Travis's direction because he was further than the guy.  And I just went, like, threw my arms up.  And I was like, un-fucking-believable.  And then he comes in running back at me with his finger out. 
[02:35:30]  So that's none of his fucking business right there.  She's addressing Travis, like, this situation is un-fucking-believable.  I'm not saying the guy's not a prick either.  He comes in with his finger pointed in my face.  And he's like, you don't fucking say that.  You don't fucking open your mouth.  You don't fucking talk like that.  And I'm like, excuse me?  I'm a grown woman.  You don't tell me how to talk, sir.  Like, what are you kidding me?  And then he got even more in my face.  Here's something else.  I don't think Jimmy understands because you're a peaceful guy.  You don't...  Peaceful?  Are you kidding me?  No, you're...  Wow.  What a bad... 
[02:36:00]  That was a very big misinterpretation.  I've never heard any physical...  Are you under the influence right now or something?  I've never heard any physical violence with you.  No, no, that is stupid.  You don't get in fights with people and stuff.  So you saying that this guy's a problem and you don't deal with people that are problems.  You being you, anyone that comes up to you and wants to fight you is a problem.  Because you don't put out this vibe and you don't make situations where people that aren't problems are going to want to hit you. 
[02:36:30]  So it's almost inconsequential to say the guy's a problem.  If a guy is fucking in your wife's face yelling, he's a problem.  But that's just the way these people are.  I don't mean just a problem like that.  Because again, don't forget, on a nightly basis, you fucking make snap judgments when dealing with people.  When they're talking or heckling, immediately you're sizing people up.  And you get a really weird feeling like, is there a violence potential?  Because then you've got to turn your face this way and have something thrown at you. 
[02:37:00]  So you're always...  Personally, I'm always dealing with people.  And you have to make very quick decisions.  And you kind of know that this guy's for real.  And this is going to get fucking ugly.  So I'll attack a certain...  Whatever.  So to me, a problem is not a guy that reacts aggressively when you're arguing.  A problem goes beyond that.  Like a guy who is looking for something...  Like, I'm not talking about just two people being pissed off at each other.  I'm talking about what he saw.  There's something in his eyes.  There's something in the eyes which is just beyond...  Like, you fucking...  You saw the eyes?  If I can jump in for a second. 
[02:37:30]  I don't even think this guy was, like, intending to be a problem when he started.  I think it was more that he was on the defensive.  Like, he knew he was doing something wrong to piss somebody else off.  And was just, like, got very defensive about it.  Because, I mean, at one point, when he came back and started harassing us again, he had his key in his fist.  Like, ready to attack Travis.  Oh, the old key in the fist gag.  That means he couldn't fight Travis.  I didn't see a key. 
[02:38:00]  Hey, Lisa, I gotta ask this question.  Plot of bat.  Because I really don't know the answer to this.  Because I haven't been in that situation.  But as a woman, were you hoping Travis was going to punch this guy?  No, absolutely not.  Okay.  Because, I mean, baby, I love you and all, but Travis isn't the biggest guy.  I've already said it.  What do you think?  Okay, gotcha.  Wait, wait, go ahead.  Anyway, I was going to say, Travis isn't the biggest guy.  So, I kind of felt more confident in, like, taking a hit, if need be.  Oh, wow. 
[02:38:30]  Then you're mad, taking the guy on.  Oh, is that sad?  Did you hear that, Travis?  I hope you did.  I heard, I heard.  Let me explain.  Wait, wait, let's slow down.  Can you explain to Travis, just in case he doesn't understand what we said?  Well, your wife is saying that she's better suited to take a punch than you.  That's pretty much what she said in plain Canadian.  And now that explains the beard that you have grown.  The very full, I look tougher beard.  There's nothing.  Like, it's two guys fighting. 
[02:39:00]  Big deal.  But if a man and a woman are in a verbal squabble and the woman gets hit, that's a big deal.  That means other people are jumping in.  Well, that is true.  We'll give you that.  Yeah, but your husband jumped in.  I get to sue you, Dad.  And I can use the money right now.  To me, right now, what you're doing.  I was shopping at Ikea.  I think Lisa is giving a nicer version because she's calm now.  But I think that when you're arguing with a guy like that, and it's not just, I think  you're putting him in a very, Travis in a very bad position, that could be avoided.  That easily could be avoided. 
[02:39:30]  By giving him his parking space, being shit on and stepped on by a bully.  But it's not that.  By a fucking bully who had a bad day because his cunt fucking wife is at home, and he's  got to go to Ikea and pick the shit up himself.  Fuck that asshole.  I do agree.  Fuck him.  I agree with you.  His wife was actually there, too.  Oh.  Well, what?  You guys should have.  Should have gotten in her face.  A tag team.  You should have taken on the wife.  Yeah.  In a tag team match, we're going to Ikea, and you're going to catch hell. 
[02:40:00]  No chance.  No chance in hell.  That's right.  Sukiyama is going to be in his van with Ikea furniture.  It's an Ikea match.  And the Canadian bruiser, Lisa.  You realize you put Travis in a little danger there, right?  A little bit.  No.  No.  Anyway.  A little bit.  Maybe a little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit. 
[02:40:30]  A little bit.  Well, she said at the end, she's like, I understand that you jumped in.  I didn't want you to, but, you know, at least she understands that instinctively that's  what a guy has to do.  And saying happy Chinese New Year, I mean, that's just, like, I know, Anthony, you're  right.  The guy is a piece of shit.  I'm not saying he's not.  Yeah.  It's nothing to do with that.  That's irrelevant.  But if the guy has a fucking problem, all the, well, he's this and he's wrong, it  doesn't matter.  When you're fucking, when a guy pulls out a pistol, it's like people have this really,  That's a different story.  People have this veil of, I'm going to be safe. 
[02:41:00]  And I'm not saying you don't, you can't fight if you have to fight.  But when it can be avoided with a guy that you sense is a real problem, why wouldn't you  avoid it?  Because I hate the thought of them leaving thinking they fucking won.  Yeah, Jim.  I agree.  Jim.  Jim.  I can't.  Tell me what I said.  Fuck it.  I will.  For a month, I'll be biting my own fucking cheek.  That's what she said.  I agree.  But you know what?  I would rather have that.  Then how many stories have you read about just guys that pull out pistols?  I mean, God bless you.  And you're not wrong. 
[02:41:30]  But man, when you're in that situation, it's really tough to take on your philosophy.  Better draw fast, motherfucker.  Better draw fast.  I slammed that guy's door in the cab, you know, a week or so ago.  He could have had a gun.  He could have had a knife.  But I was so enraged that, yeah, the smart thing would be to walk away.  I will not disagree with that.  But when you're in that situation, you're like, I got to fucking do something now.  But he did the right thing, and then nothing happened.  I'm not a pacifist.  I'm not saying you don't fucking fight a guy if he's in your woman's face. 
[02:42:00]  But what I'm saying is she, I think, was being very aggressive and pissed.  Okay, fine.  She doesn't take any shit.  But not reading that guy well.  Like, not being perceptive enough to read what that situation was.  Something happened.  Bully went home feeling he won.  Exactly.  So he can bully another day.  But a bully, he might have done that to a guy who was 6'5".  That's what I'm saying.  Like, a guy who has a problem is not really looking to pick on someone smaller.  Like, because what he was doing, like, he was threatening the man. 
[02:42:30]  Like, do you understand what I'm saying?  He might have done that to a guy.  I agree with you.  But at the same time, like, when that other guy jumped in at the end.  Oh, he went after him, too?  Yeah, he went right after him, too.  He was, he would have taken on everyone.  That's what I'm saying.  This is not about right and wrong.  This is not about being a man.  When's the last time anybody in this room had a fight?  You avoid it when possible.  Like, when you're driving, you think, I don't want to fucking run people.  I had to bite my arm one time because I wanted to run somebody over.  I physically wanted to run them over.  It's stupid.  Yeah. 
[02:43:00]  But you know what I mean?  It's not about, hey, guys, walk away when you have to.  But what I'm saying is when your woman is arguing with a guy who she's not understanding what the situation is.  I'm not talking about what your woman is.  I fully understood what the situation was.  And believe me, I didn't fight to my full potential, either.  Like, I toned myself down.  I'm a hothead.  I can't help myself.  Okay, but you're saying, like, what, you're saying, what do I, what, I wanted to see what he would do.  Poor Travis.  That's that veil of protection that that pizza guy had when talking to Kenny.  That's that veil, that weird veil that people have where they think nothing can happen to him. 
[02:43:30]  And it's like, people get shot over shit.  Like, that guy, did he understand who he was fucking shit talking?  No.  Like, when he was talking to Kenny?  Could have disassembled him right there.  It wasn't about that guy's brave enough to fight Kenny if he's in a rage.  It was about that guy thinking he had some kind of a protective fucking shield in front of him.  It's like when, you know, it'd be like, it's just.  Yeah, people do, in real situations, when it's not a movie or some article you're reading, they do think that they're impervious. 
[02:44:00]  That's what I mean.  But there are certain situations where that takes a backseat.  You're right.  You're right.  And before the confrontation, obviously Lisa shouldn't have mouthed off to a nut.  Right.  But once it happens, you're past the point of returning back to her not saying something.  So now you have to, you're in a new situation.  You're in defense mode. 
[02:44:30]  Yes.  And you're in, this guy is a fucking asshole.  And if he's gonna, if there's an inkling he's gonna punch me, you gotta get him first.  I agree.  I completely agree.  Um, but what Travis saw was a fucking guy who was a problem.  And then you're in defense mode, of course.  But like, why not defuse the situation?  Because first of all, I mean, if the guy.  By apologizing to this cunt that wanted to fucking.  He didn't apologize.  I didn't apologize.  He didn't apologize.  He just defused the situation. 
[02:45:00]  Saying, sir, I don't want a problem with you and stuff is, is.  I didn't, I didn't apologize for my wife.  I didn't say, she shouldn't be talking like that.  Yeah, you're completely right, you know.  He just defused the fucking, what could have been a violent situation against him that  he would have lost.  No offense, but he probably would have lost that situation.  Because that guy was in a rage and he wasn't.  Let's go to Carl in Jersey.  Carl, what's up?  Hey, what's happening?  I walked over with you guys one day.  It was just Jimmy and Kenny and Anthony.  And a cab got real close to Jimmy's leg. 
[02:45:30]  And Jimmy like spit either on the front of the cab or in front of the cab.  And so I tell the guy, what are you gonna do?  What?  What?  Come on.  And the guy inched the cab a little forward towards his knee.  I just wonder what would have happened if the guy would have just stepped on the gas.  Well, okay, maybe I did something stupid.  Or I'm not saying I've never been guilty of it.  Oh.  And what if that guy would have just punched Lisa right in the head and just drove away?  But that's the point I'm making too, is that you, in a weird way, like if he, say  you want to knock Travis out and then punch her.  It's almost like, it's an avoidable situation with a guy who's a fucking, a nut. 
[02:46:00]  And if you send somebody who's a nut, you know.  So send him off to be a nut to other people too.  Fuck it.  But it's like, what's the, what's the, what's the, I mean, aside from the emotion, because  I feel the same way you do.  Fuck that.  What's the point?  Not going home with your stomach in a knot that you didn't fucking punch this idiot.  That you didn't leave him sitting on the ground.  Uh, and, and, and, and, and sitting on the fucking parking lot of Ikea on the ground with  you driving home in your van laughing with your chick instead of him laughing with his 
[02:46:30]  fucking, uh, uh, bound foot chick, uh, as they laugh about how they got away with  fucking, you know, no one, no one pulls one over on me.  Look what I did.  Fuck him.  Leave him bleeding.  Fight dirty too.  Kick him in the balls and then bite his ear off.  See, and fuck him.  Ant's a small guy.  Ant's a small guy and has dealt with these fucking bullies.  Dude, I'm huge.  Well, now you are.  Look at my pipes.  He wouldn't have said this before he started.  But no, but I'm saying this is, I got that, I got roid rage now. 
[02:47:00]  He's got that rage, man.  He's got that fucking, he's not going to ever be bullied again.  He would shoot somebody before he allowed them to bully.  Absolutely.  But that's a reaction.  I'll go to prison first.  But that shouldn't skewer your judgment.  I'll get fucked in the ass just so I can prove a point.  But you, but, remember when.  Yeah, that's isolated.  Thanks.  Remember when you and your chick had that problem and you got annoyed at her for running  her mouth?  You both, you moved seats.  Yes.  You moved seats.  You didn't stand up and say.  Girl on girl.  No, no, but I'm saying.  I couldn't do anything.  You also saw that the guys were going to be a problem.  It was a whole fucking thing that was going to happen that wasn't necessary if you just 
[02:47:30]  moved.  Like if you just, because technically your girl was in the right because the other bitch  was talking.  Yeah.  So it's almost like.  But me and the guy had like this camaraderie going.  We were like, because he was like, oh shit.  She put her in battle mode and I'm like, yeah.  Now, you know, we got to watch as our chicks duke it out.  He didn't want any part of getting into a fight with me or my girlfriend, but I couldn't  help my girlfriend out.  And this big Puerto Rican woman was going to fucking tear the shit out of my girlfriend. 
[02:48:00]  So that's why we got up and left.  Okay.  Because you saw that.  No one scenario.  No, no, but you saw it was a problem and it was able to be diffused.  You didn't run away with your tail between your legs.  You avoided fucking having a fist fight in a movie theater.  You're 40.  Who was I punching?  When the girls get into it, you had to pull the girl off.  You would have had to pull them apart.  Yeah, you would have had to do it.  Something would have gone on.  It would have gotten ugly.  And you sense that.  But it wasn't a guy.  When it's a guy coming up to your girl, that's a fucking issue. 
[02:48:30]  This is a bully, a fucking...  Yeah.  They call us misogynistic.  That's a woman hater who's there with his fucking submissive wife who probably fucking  walks on those wooden shoes.  I'm not disagreeing with that.  They have a paper house.  You moved like you made the right move.  Because technically you guys were in the right.  That bitch was yapping.  And your chick was kind of like that.  Like right to go.  What the fuck?  All right.  Yeah.  So let me jump in here.  Because let me ask Jimmy this. 
[02:49:00]  Would you ever...  Ever.  Would you ever have to hit a guy that was getting in the face of your chick?  Without a doubt.  Without.  Of course I would.  Yeah, because you're both sort of right.  I think every guy sizes up the situation.  I admitted that yesterday.  I've told some crazy stories on this show.  But the dumb Frenchman underwater, I knew I could take the guy.  Especially in those rules.  The guy that I slammed his leg.  You're standing on earth.  The guy where I slammed his leg with the cab door. 
[02:49:30]  I knew I could take him.  But if it's some big, huge 6'4 black guy.  Oh, kicking the car.  Why does color have to come into this?  Well, kicking a car in...  Oh, right.  Because they could beat up white people.  Kicking the BMW in Philly recently.  Because these fucking bitches were wearing head-to-toe furs.  I looked and I knew I could take care of this crap.  Right.  So do you size it up?  It's hard to say.  If violence is happening, or if you're in protect mode like an animal, I don't think you can.  I think you just react.  Of course.  Right, right, right.  Like he did when he jumped in front like there's a problem. 
[02:50:00]  And then he saw...  Well, you confused a lot of people, though.  You made it feel like you would never really...  No.  No, no, no.  I was confused by that.  I don't know.  I think it came across like that.  No, not at all.  It's a feedback.  But it sounds like the only situation you would step in on is if some guy, completely  unprovoked, came up and hassled your check.  No, no, not at all.  But I would also be very angry at my chick for not reading the situation.  And fucking...  You have to defuse the situation.  It's almost like...  She has a job in this whole thing as well. 
[02:50:30]  You're on the subway.  Right.  And we've all been on the subway.  Now, if some maniac puts his hands on your woman, of course you're going to fucking attack  him.  Yeah, that's...  Hey, some crazy motherfuckers on the subway, and he's fucking jumping around, he looks  at your girl, he goes, you fucking ugly bitch, and then walks away.  What are you going to do?  Go after him?  You know he's a nut.  Well, he's crazy.  He's not shopping at Ikea.  I understand the difference.  He probably smells like urine.  Point I'm making is you would size up that situation and immediately understand this is  the right move to make.  It doesn't mean you're being a faggot.  The guy's got a problem, and you know he's got a problem.  Yeah, but that situation is a lot different than what Travis was in. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're talking a true nut.  Right.  That's a guy with a problem.  And he's not leaving thinking he got a fucking, a good piece of you.  He's walking away thinking he's on fucking Mars.  But who knows what this guy is thinking?  And the only reason I'm saying that is because I don't care who agrees with me, because the  other guy that jumped in, the guy went right to him.  It was like, that's the guy who's looking for something.  That wasn't the guy who went, oh shit, there's two men.  And he should have gotten it.  There's two men.  And he should have fucking gotten it.  I think he was a very insecure douche.  If he really was going to do something, he would have punched... 
[02:51:30]  He would have done something.  Travis, he would have pushed Lisa.  Of course.  He was a fucking pussy.  Kick him in the nuts and bite his cheek off.  And he won a battle.  Bite his fucking cheek off.  He won a battle that he probably shouldn't have won.  In my opinion.  Maybe you're right.  This is just how I'm seeing it.  Because especially with the move where you put the keys in your hand and you got one  poking out and stuff.  Hack.  That's hack shit.  That's hack movie shit.  All right.  So what was the right move for Travis?  Instantly take the motherfucker out.  I don't want to sound like I'm fucking Mr. Macho and shit.  Because given the same situation, I don't know what I would have done.  Any situation is different. 
[02:52:00]  You don't know what you're going to do.  But a guy like that has to be fucking brought down to his knees immediately.  The second he starts getting in your chick's face and then turns to you, you instantly punch  him in the fucking nose.  Instantly fucking punch him in the nose.  And he's out of the fucking situation.  Got problem solved.  You know what Travis should have done, seriously?  Is he should have blown his rape whistle.  All right.  You carry it with you. 
[02:52:30]  That's true.  I didn't think of it.  Nathaniel, what's your take on it?  You're obviously a very good fighter.  He wants to fight.  Dan would challenge him to a Call of Duty 4 match and kick his ass.  I'm not talking about Dan personally who can really take care of himself.  I'm like, you're reading Travis in that situation.  What should Travis have done?  What should Travis have done?  I'm having a rough one today, man.  I agree with you.  I think violence is the last resort.  All right, sensei. 
[02:53:00]  It's true because too much, even if you, say you punch the guy, you go for the nose,  you hit his cheek.  Nice.  And it glances off his face.  And all you've done is really upset and started a fight with some psycho.  You've gained nothing and lost, you know.  Your teeth.  Yeah.  All right.  Do you go home?  Especially with, you know, Travis's buildup.  Look, how about a punch and a kick to the balls at the same time and bite his throat?  But then you're beating the shit out of somebody in a parking lot.  You've got to fight so fucking dirty.  It's really...  You really got... 
[02:53:30]  I don't fight clean.  No fucking way.  Ever.  None of us have had a fight in 20 years.  None of us have.  None of us have.  Because we're thinking...  You think on a daily...  As much rage as you have.  Any fight I've ever had has been very dirty.  Well, because you're a small guy.  Except when Boomer Esiason broke my arm.  And he was big.  But then you just fucking took it out on the Jets.  A bunch of years later.  That was a fight I should have stayed out of.  He was.  Yeah.  If I thought there was no way to get out of violence, I would fight.  I would...  Balls first.  Those are just big targets hanging there.  Right.  Yeah.  And then I would absolutely fight. 
[02:54:00]  But I don't...  I think if you can get out of it without actually getting hit or punching somebody,  it's better.  But I'm not talking about being a doormat either.  And that doesn't make you feel shitty when you leave the situation.  Yeah, but...  Yeah, but...  I'm an adult.  You know, you lose.  No.  You win, you lose.  Anthony, the only reason I'm disagreeing with you, the only reason is because of the way  the situation started, which was with...  I love my girlfriend.  Of course I would defend her.  Of course I would defend her. 
[02:54:30]  Of course I would step in and punch somebody if I had to.  Of course.  But I would be very angry at her for having that fucking delusion of safety, like, that  I don't have.  You don't have that delusion of safety.  So that would annoy me that she perpetuated this situation.  I don't necessarily think that she did that thinking that, you know, I was going to be  there.  Because what she said, just un-fucking-believable, was nothing.  Yeah, un-fucking-believable is nothing.  I agree.  It's nothing.  The only time I was a little upset was when she said, you know, Happy Chinese New Year. 
[02:55:00]  Because that, you know, as funny as it is...  It's very funny, by the way.  It's very funny.  I thought it was really just going to send the situation over the top.  By the way, Lisa, that still bothers that guy.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you did get...  Because that was below the belt.  It couldn't have just been two human beings.  You had to bring race into it.  Wonderful move, by the way.  Wonderful move.  We got another Travis online from Iowa.  Travis from Iowa.  What's up?  Yeah, I think you both are right. 
[02:55:30]  But I think what Jimmy's trying to say is, what Lisa, if I can't remember her name, would  have said that if Travis wouldn't have been there.  That's what Jimmy's trying to say.  No, no, no, I'm not.  No, no, no, dude.  I think she probably would have.  No, no, no.  I think you're misinterpreting me a little bit.  I don't think that Lisa was wanting Travis.  When I say the veil of safety, I don't think she was using Travis as that.  But I'm saying in the same sense that that guy was shit-talking Kenny.  Like, what are you doing in the real world?  Like, this is not a film.  This is a real situation, and you're not reading it right. 
[02:56:00]  That's what...  Of course, you have to defend your woman.  Of course you do.  But that's what would drive me crazy.  Like, when my girlfriend does shit, like, she doesn't...  She's never argued with people.  She's very funny.  And we're like, you know, we're walking one time, and this guy walked up a little behind  us, just, you know, passing us into it.  Oh!  Like, she was scared, and I laughed.  Yeah.  But I'm like, don't fucking engage people in the fucking streets, stupid.  It's really annoying, because you don't...  Oh, yeah.  That's a weird situation, even though your motives aren't bad.  Do not...  I don't mean be a coward and fucking... 
[02:56:30]  I'm a dick.  Like, if I have a fucking argument with a heckler, I, honest to God, will stand outside  the door at the cellar.  I don't want to fight the guy, but I'm not going to be cowed.  Like, I'm not going to run upstairs.  Right.  So I will literally stand outside the fucking clubs for, like, five minutes and see, well,  if the guy wants to come out and say anything, I'm here.  And that's only so I can go home at night and know that I didn't get heckled and run away.  Yeah.  So it's like, it's a stupid thing, but I have the same fucking ego as another man does.  I've spelt it out to my girlfriend, too.  I've spelt it out.  Don't fucking cause problems out on the street with anybody. 
[02:57:00]  Like, don't ever put me in a situation where I have to start swinging because of something  you said.  I've spelt it out.  I'm sorry to jump in, but I've got to get going.  All right, Lisa.  All righty.  Have a good day, boys.  Go start trouble somewhere else.  Goodbye, you Canadian ladies.  It's a troublemaker.  You Canadian racist.  Canadian racist.  And I do love Lisa.  They're working at that sweatshop, myradiostore.com.  Yep.  I like her balls. 
[02:57:30]  I like the fact you're in a sweatshop.  Is it a sweatshop?  Oh, I don't know.  It's a big warehouse.  They're a bunch of drunks, are what they are.  Fucking work two hours, and then it's happy hour the rest of the day.  Jesus Christ, how does anything get done there with a guy named Ziggy running the joint?  Ziggy and his stupid marijuana.  Oh.  Oh, enough.  I've seen Ziggy laying on the floor in a bar.  Just in a bar under a pool table on the floor.  And he's the boss.  By the way, I threw some marijuana away.  Did you?  By accident, though. 
[02:58:00]  Because I was still debating if I was going to start smoking again.  I can't get into that shit.  And I appreciate the fine gesture someone did for me, but it ended up in a, I got a Christmas  card, and I was hiding it from my designer and a cleaning woman, and it was in the bag  that the Christmas card came in.  Oops.  And then I was cleaning up, and I might have thrown away some fine bud.  Threw in the bud.  So someone's going to be really pissed at me. 
[02:58:30]  Oh.  Anyway, Mike DeStefano.  DeStefano.  DeStefano.  Sorry, Mike.  Hey.  I'm very under the weather.  So is Jimmy, but sounding better, Jimmy.  Yeah, I'm only, I'm only, it's my congestion.  DeStefano's itchy.  No, I told it.  You got some stories on this?  You've been listening for the last half hour.  Oh, he was outside fucking going, yeah, Anthony.  Yeah, it's so.  I was cheering for you, but then Jim's right, too.  Everybody's kind of right, but you should have, you gotta, you gotta, like what you're  saying, that it's fucking so important.  You can't leave somewhere feeling like, like you let somebody abuse you. 
[02:59:00]  It'll eat away at you.  I've been in that situation in the past.  I've been in both sides of that situation where I've left a situation after  talking things out and felt like a fucking idiot for doing it and just regretting not  punching the guy in the face.  And then I've, I've punched the guy and felt great about it.  Well, what you do is you.  The guy deserved it.  You work with levels.  You know what I mean?  If I bump into you, I say, I'm sorry.  And you say, go fuck your mother. 
[02:59:30]  I don't hit you.  I say, what's the matter?  What are you?  Asshole.  Yeah, whatever.  And then you push it to a certain point and then you escalate it, you know?  But the women, listen, they fucking start shit.  I'm not saying.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I will not deny that.  We're all on the same page there.  My ex was like, if somebody would have hit her, I would have fucked them up, but I would  have counted to three first.  I would have gave them three seconds to fucking hit her because she deserved it.  Like, you're that kind of scenario.  Yeah.  I've looked at guys and go, I know, dude, I'm sorry.  Like, I've apologized, like, to waiters because she was such a cunt to them. 
[03:00:00]  And you can see they want to fucking choke her.  And you almost want to say, look, I'm only dating her a few months.  Punch her once in the throat when I go to the bathroom.  Something.  Because you really get, you know, women could, every, not every fight.  I was arrested in Florida.  Listen to it.  Right before my honeymoon.  Right before my wedding.  I was, we lived in Florida.  We were going to, we got married in New York.  Our wedding was in New York and we bought these tickets on this cheap airline.  I think it was Airbus or some shit. 
[03:00:30]  This is a long time ago.  And we get to the airport and this little fuck behind the counter is like just going really  slow and we're running late for our flight.  Long story short, I start arguing with the guy.  Like, can you hurry up?  I'm the second in behind a woman and he's just going.  So I said, dude, we're going to be late for our flight.  And he's like, just wait a minute.  Like with his hand, I said, dude, please help us out.  My wife says to me, honey, don't, don't, uh, push his buttons.  They'll fuck up our luggage. 
[03:01:00]  Like just, and I just imagined that he said it.  I dove over the counter.  You had to see me.  I was holding the guy's neck.  My wife's pulling my legs.  The cops got arrested.  I had to put my wedding off a week because I got arrested.  So that wasn't a good thing to know.  But sometimes like Jimmy said, as comics, man, people, you know, cause you want to battle  them with your wits and Jimmy more than me actually can fuck somebody up mentally.  I'm not as good.  I get right to, they heckle boo and I go, Hey, don't heckle me, man. 
[03:01:30]  That's not right.  And then they say, well, you suck.  And I say, how about if I kick you to death or something?  You know what I mean?  I go right to that.  And then Jim will take like 20 minutes and rip them apart verbally.  Deconstruct somebody.  They're left like psychologically traumatized.  They go out in the parking lot and off themselves.  They're like that.  But, but then you have guys that threaten you.  I'm sure big fucking lung heads and you just got to look at them and dude, I know you're 
[03:02:00]  a little guy and all that, but you would have felt so much better if you would have like  told that guy to go fuck his mother or something.  And even if you get a beating sometimes, it's good because sometimes you need a little  beating in life.  As long as you told him to fuck his mother, that's kind of what you remember.  But you could get killed too.  There's people.  That's what I'm saying.  It's crazy.  It's not just a punch in the face or like the consequences are you're going to have a  black guy tomorrow because we all look at that like, yeah, I can take a black guy  or even a fucking ass kicking, but it's not about that.  It's not about, oh, he might sock me.  It's about what if he pulls out something and slashes my face or it's like you have to think 
[03:02:30]  that way when you sense that somebody is a fucking problem.  And I'm, I'm believing Travis when he says he senses the guy was a fucking problem.  He's not saying like a guy like Mike is a guy who's just a fucking aggressive dude,  but he's not a fucking, he's not an insane.  Do you understand what I mean?  Like a guy like Mike is going to punch you in the face, but you don't have to worry.  Like, is this going to have a pistol on him?  I mean, you really have to think that shit in this world.  It's fucking stupid not to.  I look like I have both going, right?  Yeah.  I mean, I can see you doing, of course. 
[03:03:00]  No, no, but yeah.  And if people disagree, by the way, put them through.  I don't care.  Fuck that, you know, bullies like, like, you know, like you were saying something about  bullies.  Like you gotta be a real like punk to be a bully, really.  Yep.  Do you know what I'm saying?  Like I would never like a guy, especially smaller guys.  I never like get aggressive with smaller guys.  You just feel like a piece of shit.  But most people don't have like a, they don't, they're not guiding themselves through life  based on their moral fucking fiber.  They just do whatever the fuck they feel like. 
[03:03:30]  That's what I can't fucking stand.  When this guy pulls up and thinks he's entitled and he's somehow, his time is more fucking  important than mine, then that pisses me off to no end.  And I won't listen to any argument over why he should be ahead of me or something.  I'll see people walk up.  You ever see the subtle walk up and try to cut right in front of you, move?  And people just stand there.  They don't say anything.  I go, excuse me.  I've been standing on line. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, I just have these two things.  Ah, well, when you get up to the counter, it'll be fast then.  I go, watch how quick I am.  And I'll go, I'll get my shit, and I'll leave.  Two seconds, I'm done.  Everyone that's in front of me, ten fucking minutes.  They can't figure shit out.  This guy wasn't big, though.  He was a small dude.  No, he was probably a little bigger than anything.  He wasn't like he was a big.  Well, that means he was a giant to you, Travis.  That's true.  Everyone's big to Travis.  A guy yelling like that to me does not constitute a bully because he's just a dick or a maniac. 
[03:04:30]  There's a difference between.  What about the sense of fucking entitlement that this asshole has?  I don't know enough about that system.  If you're pulling up and your stuff's ready and you have your car and someone is saving a spot,  that would annoy me if someone was saving a spot and they didn't have their car there  and I'm just grabbing something.  It's like, well, why would I wait for you to load a truck when I have my car here?  I don't know what the system at Ikea is, to be honest with you.  I'm not completely smart either.  I'm sure it's stupid.  Oh, but it's almost like if he had his van and his stuff was ready, why are you saving 
[03:05:00]  a spot when you have to go get your car?  I don't know.  Maybe their shit was...  I don't know how that works.  ...readier.  Everyone grows up in a different environment, you know?  My cousin's here today, my little cousin.  We had a grandmother.  Our grandmother would tell us if somebody makes fun of you, you hit them with something,  like a bat or a pipe.  This is my grandmother.  I'm not kidding you, we were taught this as kids, so you grow up and that's what you  think, you see that, you see that happening. 
[03:05:30]  I'm like, for somebody that's like a tough guy, street guy, I'm very respectful of people  because I'm afraid to, like, I don't know you, I'm nice to you until, like, if it gets  down, but I don't know you and I know guys that are smaller than him that have 40 or 50  bodies under their belt.  Like, I grew up in that kind of environment, so, like, if you cut someone off in my neighborhood,  you don't really give them the finger, especially if it's a woman, it could be a wise guy's  fucking sister or daughter. 
[03:06:00]  Like, you just, I grew up like that, like, being careful of what you say and what you  do.  And a lot of people don't have that, and Jim's point about that safety thing, like, we're  in a bank and, you know, they can't hit, he won't hit me here, but, you know, so they  could say, fuck you, you fucking piece of shit.  And then someone will just crack you.  And you're like, oh, fuck, I read that one wrong.  And I don't mean letting people shit on you.  I don't mean that.  I mean, like, just starting an aggressive situation when you don't have to because you're not reading  what the guy really is. 
[03:06:30]  I'm not talking about if a guy walks up and motherfucks your girl, you're supposed to  go, well, he's a little kooky.  I don't mean that.  Well, I understand that.  That's a given.  That's 100%.  You probably won't find any guy that if a guy comes up and starts motherfucking your  girl, isn't going to step in and punch him in the face.  But then there are levels of motherfucking your girl, you know, where the guy still deserves  a punch in the fucking face.  And some people's level is higher than others.  I don't like the idea of someone getting away with something, getting one over on me. 
[03:07:00]  And that annoys the piss out of me.  Get a little older, he'll fucking eat at you.  We got to clear this up, too.  We don't hang out in tough neighborhoods.  No.  So it makes it a little easier.  I got to be honest with you.  If you're not dealing with that kind of stuff.  Like Mike's neighborhood, I'm a fucking Boy Scout.  Trust me.  Yeah, it's crazy.  I'm a Boy Scout.  It really is.  And it's not about, like, I'm tough or any of this.  But in some of these neighborhoods out there in Long Island, you're the fucking 
[03:07:30]  accountant or rabbi in my neighborhood.  You're the gangster.  Come on.  You're the gangster.  Last night, I told, I said that the seller, we were, oh, Frank,  Smiley came out to watch me.  And I invited him to go to Rayo's for dinner, you know?  And he's like, you could go to Rayo's?  I go, yeah.  I go, you know, I can go to Rayo's.  When are we getting the big invite?  Whenever you want.  When is Rayo's?  It's a restaurant up in Harlem.  It's a tough place to get into, Jim.  Well, yeah.  It's like you got to know someone.  Wise guys and stuff like that.  But Opie, I grew up.  There was a little shooting there last year or two years ago.  My family, like I grew up, my uncle's got friends there, whatever.  That don't mean nothing about who I am. 
[03:08:00]  It's just, it's cool to be able to go there and eat.  But I, so I invited Frank Smiley, the guy from Conan, and he started like, whoa, I don't  want to not put you on the show.  And he's like doing that whole Sopranos thing.  And it became a little annoying, like treating me like, you know, like, oh, you're Italian.  It was just weird fucking thing.  Are you going to be on the show?  Yeah, Friday.  Yeah, we're calling for you.  Oh, nice, stupid.  Good fucking night.  Yeah, that's why Mikey's in.  Calling you on Friday?  No, he said I was in just to hang out.  Beautiful. 
[03:08:30]  Not really.  Oh, really?  You were in recently.  Beautiful.  We like to, like, spread these things out.  Spread it out?  No.  All right.  Calling him Friday night.  Mike's a funny comic, man.  Thanks, man.  He's been killing on our show.  Not the first appearance.  You were shy.  Because I didn't say nothing.  Yeah, the last two, you've been great, though.  It was fun.  Calling him Friday, right?  Yeah, calling him Friday night.  Make sure we get that out there.  We have to take a break.  So are we going to agree to disagree?  Are we going to...  I don't even think we disagree that much, to be honest with you.  Yeah, we're very close on this.  But it's just the level of intensity and how we would react to it. 
[03:09:00]  Everybody's saying the right thing.  Everyone has their line.  It's going to happen.  You're going to make that decision when the time comes, you know?  I'm more like Anthony.  I lean more towards him where I almost, and it sounds fucking nuts, but I almost, it's  like I, at that moment, I'd rather die than walk away feeling like a pussy.  Because there's no worse feeling.  And I know that sounds nuts, but...  No worse feeling.  And you embrace that, and you just...  Very good.  We're going to take a break.  Listen, Jen Rose from South Carolina.  I got to call her out.  She's on Instant Feedback. 
[03:09:30]  And this will help the other Instant Feedbackers out there, because we're a very interactive radio  show.  When you write, I don't know if you guys talked about it yet, but Craig Ferguson's  show last night was fucking hilarious.  Get some clips if you can.  Love the show.  What?  Why would we ever just search out Craig Ferguson clips?  Well, let's see what it's about.  Maybe it's very funny.  Maybe we're bad.  The point I'm making, and this could help other Instant Feedbackers, you got to give  me a little more detail, Jen Rose.  What was funny about it?  What clip was funny about it? 
[03:10:00]  Nah, same.  We're in the middle of a radio show.  You want us to go watch his show for an hour to see what we can play on the air?  Help us out here.  We'll just watch it on the air.  Not like we haven't.  Exactly.  For the last two hours, every 20th feedback is Jen Rose with the same fucking Instant Feedback.  You're not helping us.  Speaking of which, the guys went back to work last night.  We got their monologues.  We don't have...  Well, we focused on Letterman. 
[03:10:30]  We don't have Turd Ferguson.  Oh, wait a minute, it's Craig.  We have Letterman and Leno, though.  We'll play a couple there.  Where did that one come from?  Turd Ferguson.  Oh, it's an SNL bit?  Is it?  Yeah.  I think it was.  Okay.  And we got more with Mike.  Mike?  Mike.  Who's going to be on Conan on Friday?  Who are you on with, dude?  Do you know?  No, I don't know.  It's like a big secret.  They're not telling you.  Oh, right.  Probably a politician.  I think they don't want to promote who's going to be the guest because then that guest will  get all kinds of hate mail. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  Because fucking the producer was telling me he got tons of mail from writers, like you're  a scumbag and all this shit.  Well-written scumbag writer.  Yeah, yeah.  Well-written stuff.  It's like all well-written.  You, sir.  You, semi-colon.  Mind you, as a scumbag, yeah, everything perfectly punctuated.  Anyone see Conan last night?  Have you watched it at all?  Is it any good?  No.  I don't watch it.  No.  You don't watch it?  We just saw the quick clips that, for some reason, they've all grown big beards.  Conan, for some reason, has decided to not acknowledge that we exist, so we don't really 
[03:11:30]  pay attention to what he does.  You, the radio guy?  You guys, right?  Yeah, he's a funny guy and all.  I'll always give him that, but...  Leno and Letterman have.  I mean, that's very nice.  Yeah.  Conan won't use me either.  And I'm a fan of Conan.  And Conan won't use you either, Jimmy?  Well, Frank won't.  But, yeah, it's...  You know, whatever.  He's just the guy who books the show.  But you guys don't tell me.  Yeah, what is that about?  No big deal.  It is what it is.  I'm gonna be back Monday to talk bad about them.  No, not bad about them.  No, I'm gonna come back.  Jimmy Norton does not get that talk show.  Leave where I fuck you guys. 
[03:12:00]  Fuck with me.  Until Friday.  Let me do my set first on there.  You did great, man.  It's a good show.  Thanks, yeah.  It's just, you know, they're the first ones that offered me, so...  All right.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Very few people can be totally ruthless.  It isn't easy.  It takes more strength than you might believe.  We shall strive to be worthy of your sense of fracture. 
[03:12:30]  The Opie and Anthony virus.  Get infected.  Check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check. 
[03:13:00]  There we go.  All right.  We got to bring it to the table.  Anthony is going back up to Mohegan Sun.  Yes.  You were sort of explaining it to Mike during the break, but this is a fine ongoing story.  Anthony has taken them for a lot of due.  You might remember a while back.  I had a good...  Let's just say I had a very good night over there.  Good weekend, actually.  Oh, that's right.  We don't mention the total anymore. 
[03:13:30]  Nah, it was just...  It was a very good evening.  And Mike understands, see?  Yeah.  Are you ahead, you think, in the whole scheme of things?  Yeah.  In life?  Yeah.  In life?  In all gamblers?  I could be.  Really?  Yeah.  That's amazing.  I mean, that's rare.  I could be.  It is very rare.  Do you gamble?  Do you gamble?  A little three card.  I don't have the bug.  Yeah, I think once...  I don't have the bug.  It's like a drug.  It's like a dick.  It could be, but...  I find it extremely fun.  It's exciting.  That's right.  It's angering sometimes, and it's great. 
[03:14:00]  It's just...  It's one of those things...  Yeah, you seem to need things to rile you up.  You don't rile them up.  Yeah.  Believe me, I'm riled enough.  Dude, I love it, man.  So let's just put it this way.  Anthony did well enough...  Yeah.  We could say that, right?  Oh, yeah.  ...that they invite him back.  The fine people at Mohegan Sun have invited me back, but not only me.  Why would they invite you back?  I don't know.  You must have been funny. 
[03:14:30]  But I...  Yes.  But I think I should bring some money with me.  Yeah, they might want me to play at the tables a little more.  And Anthony doesn't have to worry about how he's getting there.  No, you know, that drive sometimes is a little wrong.  Could be a real problem.  Sometimes.  That drive up I-95 could be a real problem.  Sometimes.  Especially on the weekend.  But they have offered me the services of their private jet.  Wow.  Which I will be taking from a wonderful Republic Airport right near my house. 
[03:15:00]  Close enough to my house.  A mere 20-minute ride?  It's probably 10.  10 minutes?  Yeah.  In the air?  Oh, no.  I mean from my house to the airport.  Oh, oh, oh.  In my Shelby, a five minute.  Yeah.  No, it's probably, yeah, like a half-hour flight up there instead of...  You know.  Wow.  Trudging up 95 and then all that happy horse shit.  But also taking Keith the cop and his wife.  And mom and Sal are going. 
[03:15:30]  Christmas shoes row.  He called me the other day.  I'm so excited about the trip.  It's like a child, Sal.  He's turned into a child.  We're going on an airplane row.  He's all happy and excited.  My mother's just like, oh, Sal, stop.  You didn't tell Mike where he was from?  Baltimore.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Now that's who's Sal?  That's your mom's...  Sal's, yeah, my stepdad.  Yeah, I met him.  I think he was at the show a couple of years ago. 
[03:16:00]  That guy, Joe Curry, your buddy.  Yeah, my buddy Joe Curry.  He was showing you and your whole family were there.  Your mom and all that.  That was fun.  Yeah.  Just to add a little bit, Sal threatened our lives once.  Really?  Well...  Live on the show.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know if it was a threat.  I took it as a threat.  Did he say he was going to kill you?  Basically.  And he knew he meant it.  No, Jay, when you tell someone you're going to kill them, and I go, what do you mean?  No.  Is that a threat?  What do you mean?  No, no.  I'm just fucking talking.  Without going into details, we knew that he meant business.  Yeah. 
[03:16:30]  What'd you guys do to piss them off?  He's a softie now.  He is a softie.  He likes Christmas shoes, and we'll just move on.  He listens to the song Christmas Shoes and cries.  Yeah.  Bro!  But he's going...  The kid gets the shoes for his mom to see Jesus.  He's going on the big casino trip.  Yep, yep.  He's going to be gone.  What else are they giving you to come back?  Oh, man.  Three big sweets.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And...  I bet they can introduce you to Ozzy.  Yes.  Ozzy's going to be there that weekend.  That makes me very jealous.  And a lot of dinners at their fine restaurants they have there. 
[03:17:00]  I like Mohegan.  Good place.  It'll be fun if you didn't gamble one nickel the whole trip.  I'll just...  Yeah.  Somehow...  Hey, the food is great.  Hey, you take it easy.  When's the plane leave?  Don't tip anyone.  The plane's broken.  Drive yourself.  That's right.  We all like Mohegan Sun, even though they don't like us too much.  Well...  Something about family values and...  Yeah.  Something happened.  Not... 
[03:17:30]  Oh, Christ.  People still busting your balls?  We did the road show there.  God.  Or the virus tour there.  And we had a great time and...  But I think there were too many boobies in the audience.  There's a lot of things that they...  Oh, they're not...  He said we have morals.  Yeah.  And we would like this to be a family establishment.  Yes.  As we are taking your child's tuition money.  Yeah.  That's right.  And the fucking rent money.  Everyone has a chance.  Hypocrites.  It's it.  You gotta be in it to win it or something.  Now, can I ask what happened this morning? 
[03:18:00]  What happened?  When you got...  Something about dumping out a bit.  Is that...  Oh, yeah.  It was one of the election...  Yeah, I heard the...  Oh, because...  It was hysterical.  The word master...  Masturbation was in there.  Masturbation or masturbator or something like that.  And...  Attacking electrodes to genitals.  And genitals.  Attaching electrodes to genitals.  Which was describing a study that this guy was supposedly financing.  It was an actual spot that ran on television.  And you didn't comment on it?  No.  You guys didn't make any extra shit? 
[03:18:30]  I heard all of that, but I guess they dumped it out.  To Tom's credit, Tom Chisano's credit, he said it shouldn't have been dumped out of.  Third dump in a row that shouldn't have been dumped.  But he says that a lot.  That shouldn't have been dumped.  I know.  He says that a lot, so...  You know, ex post facto,  it's a little like...  I'm starting to wonder if that's just his defense.  I don't know.  You guys should just do one last thing and just go out with a bang.  I'm sure we will.  We're working on it.  Have somebody go out and...  I don't know.  Kill someone on a subway.  Do you think we have to plan that?  It just happens.  It's gonna happen, yeah.  It just takes a few years and it happens. 
[03:19:00]  Don't you guys have fuck you money yet?  No.  No.  I have fuck you money.  How could you not?  I have go shit in your hat money.  Oh, do you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have fuck you money to the creditors.  Yeah.  I have $900 in the bank.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Mike's gonna be on Conan Friday.  Let's remember that.  Yes.  You wanna hear what Leno and Letterman sounded like?  I sure do.  Yeah, they're back.  Good for Jay.  He worked at Crowd, I heard.  Yeah, he did.  Oh, yeah.  Now, Jay doesn't have writers.  He writes his own.  Who's your favorite guy, Jay or Letterman? 
[03:19:30]  Who do you like better?  Letterman has his writers.  But you like Letterman?  Leno.  Yeah, Jimmy loves Leno.  We all love Leno.  Yeah, Leno's great.  I mean, you know, you can't...  We were lucky enough to meet him and he was great to us.  He was really cool.  No, he stays back to his roots.  And Dave, you meet when you sit down.  You did the show, right?  You did Letterman.  You guys did.  We were lucky to do both and they go about it a little differently.  Totally.  Leno comes to your dressing room.  He's unshaven.  It looks like he doesn't even want to be there. 
[03:20:00]  Talks to you about his cars and shit.  He's talking about cars and everything, but your appearance that's about to happen.  And Letterman, they tell you he doesn't meet people.  He doesn't make eye contact with you guys.  You see him when he's going, our next guest are...  You're like, oh, okay.  This is the guy.  I found that my first three Lenos...  Oh!  Nice.  Can I not share experience?  Couldn't be prouder, Jimmy.  For Jim Norton to fucking squeeze his act into a television show is just a brilliant 
[03:20:30]  fucking accomplishment.  It really is.  And it comes off awesome.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  I think you see his filth live and you wonder how he did it.  Like instead of...  I say cuddle monster instead of cunt.  Right.  But everybody knows what I mean.  Right.  Yeah.  Who do you want to hear first?  Letterman or Leno?  All right.  Now, Letterman has his writers.  All right.  Let's start with Letterman.  Leno doesn't.  Let's go Letterman.  Here he goes.  We'll go Letterman.  Here he goes.  I know what you're thinking.  You're thinking, geez, Dave looks like a cattle drive cook. 
[03:21:00]  Beard joke.  Funny.  Ladies and gentlemen, two long months, but by God, I'm finally out of rehab.  That's funny.  That is good.  Obviously very excited to be back.  Yeah.  And he's got that really, really big beard.  Don't look too bad.  I don't know.  It's kind of interesting.  Look.  It looks awful.  It looks like Trapper John.  That's what I meant to say. 
[03:21:30]  That's what I meant to say.  Trapper John.  Trapper John.  I want to tell you something.  We haven't done a show in two months.  And seriously, during that period of time, I was very introspective.  Do you ever do that?  Do you introspect?  Here's what I learned about myself.  Show or no show, I really enjoy drinking in the morning.  I know what you're thinking to yourself. 
[03:22:00]  You're thinking, Dave looks like a missing hiker.  That's funny.  He's making a lot of beard jokes.  A lot of hairy face jokes.  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, you're watching The Late Show, the only show on the air now that has jokes written by union writers.  Let me just bring you up to date. 
[03:22:30]  There's a writer's strike going on, the Writers Guild of America.  And we were out because of the strike for two months.  And I know you're thinking to yourselves at home right now, this crap is written?  Yes.  But here's the deal.  Well, because of the strike, get ready for this, many of the award shows may be canceled this season.  Yep.  So something good has come with all of this.  That's great. 
[03:23:00]  If they can't do the Oscars.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking wonderful would that be.  That's nice.  Fucking pompous assholes.  They should just make them go out there and do their thing.  Wing it.  Wing it.  How cool would that be?  I love when fucking the Oscars they had.  What's his name?  Sean Connery talking about the movies and the mystery of the movies.  It's like, just shut up and hit your wife.  That's what you do.  Have a belt of booze and sock that mouthy cunt right in the jaw.  Fucking try to be poetic with me.  Fucking Scottish brute.  Oh, they all try that shit.  Scottish brute. 
[03:23:30]  They should force all those guys to go out on that stage without any writing.  And then they'll appreciate the comedians.  That's right.  And then Letterman.  One more taste of Letterman here.  Then we'll move on to Leno.  Don't kid yourselves.  The strike is actually getting ugly.  Earlier today over at ABC, the writers tipped over Regis.  Regis, yes.  Actually tipped him over.  Ladies and gentlemen, here's my good friend.  Oh, hey, Dave.  When are the writers coming back?  Well, they're back, Biff. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, sorry.  That's nice.  Like when the colored guy says something funny.  What is it?  Ladies and gentlemen, Paul.  He's a colored guy.  I don't know, Biff.  Yeah.  I wonder how many of those were written by our friends, Eric and Justin.  I'm happy they're back at work.  Great guys, man.  They can get us another Christmas gift.  Yeah.  Where was our Christmas gift this year?  Exactly, guys.  What happened?  All of a sudden, the rent doesn't get paid.  We don't get iPods.  You know something?  They were probably a little strapped this Christmas season. 
[03:24:30]  They didn't want anyone to know that they sent us iPods, Jimmy.  Way to go.  That's right.  They gave us Dave's home number.  Yeah.  They said, we dare you to call him at three in the morning.  All right.  And we move on to Leno.  Yes.  This is how Leno sounded last night.  First day back.  No writers, by the way.  Just Leno.  He must have had some fun.  He's so funny if his jokes are really awful.  Oh.  Real hack.  Yeah.  What do you think he did?  Do you think he called some people like, let me try this out on you? 
[03:25:00]  Jerry.  Sure.  His buddy, Jerry Seinfeld.  Maybe Jerry.  He's constantly writing and performing, though, isn't he still?  Yeah.  I'm sure he is.  He loves straight up.  He's a fucking brilliant stand-up.  Yeah.  Folks, let's get right to it.  A Jew, a Christian, and a Muslim walk into a bar.  That's funny.  The Jew says to the Muslim, see, I have no idea what they say, because there's a writer's  strike.  We don't know what they say.  That's good.  I like the fact that he opened up with a Jew and a Muslim. 
[03:25:30]  Right.  Right.  Of course Leno does that.  As you know, we are in the middle of this writer's strike here in Hollywood, and it's  already cost the town over half a billion dollars.  Five hundred million dollars, or as Paul McCartney calls that, a divorce.  But that's what it is called.  And it cost this strike especially hard here on NBC.  Do you realize there are actually more people picketing NBC now than watching NBC right now?  Now it looks like this writer's strike will affect Hollywood's award season. 
[03:26:00]  If you're not familiar with the award season in Hollywood, it runs from January 1st until  December 31st every week.  In fact, you know this?  I didn't know this.  You know the Golden Globes is the largest gathering of stars anywhere outside the Promises  Rehab Clinic in Malibu.  Did you know that?  Didn't know that, Jay.  That's fun writing.  I like the film.  A lot of cymbal crashes there.  A lot of...  You know what I'm doing?  I'm doing what I did.  I'm just saying, I think Jay probably has some people that punch up his jokes. 
[03:26:30]  Sure.  Like he comes up with the idea, and they punch him up a little bit.  You know what I'm doing?  I'm doing what I did the day I started.  All right.  I write jokes, and I wake my wife up in the middle, and they go, honey, is this funny?  Yes.  Okay.  I'm doing it.  You know?  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  So if this monologue doesn't work, it's my wife's fault, okay?  Because she said the joke was funny.  And that's...  We're not using outside guys.  We're following the guilt thing.  We can write for ourselves.  We just can't do what CBS is. 
[03:27:00]  See, Dave was able to get a deal.  Because Dave has his own comment.  I don't blame him for getting a deal.  God bless him.  But, you know, we have to go by ourselves up against the CBS machine.  One man against a monolith.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Good for him addressing it, though.  Are people pissed off at Leno?  No.  How can they be?  I don't know.  I don't think they can because Leno was so supportive of the writers.  But the reality is Dave's on.  He has to go on.  He can't not go on because it's out of Jay's control.  I mean, it's like, you know, he just can do it this way. 
[03:27:30]  And he waited until his hand was forced.  And they're all going back.  Do the writers look at it like it hurts their cause, though?  I don't know, man.  It's like, I think they have mixed feelings.  Like, these guys went back to work.  It's a big message to NBC and to the other ones.  That, hey, look, some people are now going to have our services.  But a lot of the writers are going to be left out in the cold because they happen to work for NBC.  Or they happen to work for ABC.  I don't know.  I also don't have the answer for that.  Louis C.K. would be great to ask.  Because he fucking knows all this stuff. 
[03:28:00]  Is he around?  As I call him, Louis the Queer.  Fucking red-headed nothing.  Another reason we had to come back was, you know, a lot of people get their news from the monologue.  Because we cover a lot of the stories the mainstream media will not cover.  For example, did you know this?  Did you know this?  Three weeks ago, Idaho Senator Larry Craig married Britney Spears.  Did you know that?  You see that?  See, no one knew.  This is the only place you will find that out.  Other news stories that happened while we were off.  New Jersey has banned the death penalty. 
[03:28:30]  Death penalty now illegal in New Jersey.  Now, I don't want to confuse anybody.  If you kill a guy in New York, you can still dump the body in New Jersey.  You just can't kill the guy.  All right.  Getting big laughs.  They say Al-Qaeda now trying to recruit women.  This kind of makes you wonder, what does Al-Qaeda promise women to become terrorists?  Like men get to 72 virgins, right? 
[03:29:00]  What do women get?  50 guys that help out around the house, clean up, cut the lawn, fix the plumbing, you know?  You know what I'm saying?  Exactly.  Exactly.  Yeah.  It's good stuff.  We're not going to laugh out loud, though.  Make a ton of Islam.  I love them.  Yeah.  President Bush said again this week, the Iraqis are slowly taking back their country,  to which Exxon and Shell said, we will fight them tooth and nail.  There you go. 
[03:29:30]  Oh, tomorrow, of course, the Iowa caucus.  Iowa caucus tomorrow.  As you may know, caucus is a Greek word, which means the only day anyone pays any attention  to Iowa.  I believe that's a Greek word.  That's what it means.  I'm the audience just helping them out.  Yeah, good.  Iowa, also known as the tall corn state.  Oh, yeah.  See, that's why Dennis Kucinich had trouble being seen there.  The people, Dennis, and it is freezing in Iowa. 
[03:30:00]  It's like 20 degrees in Iowa, something like that.  In fact, it is so cold, Hillary Clinton can actually see Barack Obama's breath breathing  down her neck.  It just sounds like there's like a weird confidence thing there with Jay.  It's probably odd that, you know.  No, and I'm, I mean, because it sounds like maybe he doesn't feel comfortable that he is  coming back and that he feels like, shit, I have to do this, but I don't feel good about 
[03:30:30]  this.  Plus his whole, there's something there.  His whole routine is probably off, too, because he probably has schedules with the writers  and the confidence in the material, because he's probably bouncing it off them and they're  reviewing it together.  Right.  And now all of a sudden he's behind me.  It's like, that's probably a weird thing.  Yeah.  Like, imagine if you had to go on the air by yourself, like, what the fuck do I, it's  like a weird, you're so used to having your guys.  Right.  I'm listening like you guys, he's, the jokes are good, like you said, and he's getting big  laughs, but there's something weird there.  Something a little weird, right.  And I wonder if he just doesn't feel good that he has to do this. 
[03:31:00]  Maybe.  Did you hear that, Jimmy, or not?  No, I didn't hear that he regretted being back on.  No, I don't know what it is.  Or there's like a conference thing.  There's something that's just going on.  Yeah, there's weird energy.  It feels a little, I don't know.  Louie, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Hi, Louie.  Hi, Louie.  Hello.  Ooh.  We were talking about, we raised your name because you kind of know a lot about the writer's  strike.  And Letterman going back on, is that like good for the writers or bad that the union 
[03:31:30]  made that deal?  I don't know.  It's a little confusing to me because it seems to me like a strike is just, you strike everybody.  But I guess the idea that they think is that if he's really strong because he's got writers,  then the other shows will have more pressure on them to compete by getting their writers  back.  Like, I guess that's the notion.  I didn't see this.  I know it's kind of, I guess I don't feel like it's that easy to push around companies 
[03:32:00]  like General Electric.  You know, if it was like trying to pit the comedy seller against the, you know, the comedy  village on Bleecker Street, that's one thing.  But yeah, it's true.  That is true, man.  It does seem like it's a weird solidarity breaking away.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know.  It's there.  Those writers are back to work now.  I mean, we all voted to strike and why we weren't really didn't really vote on going 
[03:32:30]  back to work for one show.  So, but I don't know.  I mean, I get from the Writers Guild, I get great health benefits and pretty decent residual  checks.  So I kind of just go, all right, you know, go along with it.  I don't know all of the details of it, but it's, yeah, I don't know how did you guys watch  the shows?  Because I don't know.  I'm seeing how I'm seeing Louie not really agreeing with this whole thing.  What?  With the whole thing with the writers going back.  Yeah.  For one show like that.  But it might be good only because it's so weird. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's Anthony.  Yeah.  You don't think it's a good idea?  No, I'm like seeing that you don't really think it's a good idea.  It's like, this is a solidarity thing and we didn't vote on one show going back.  But, you know, hey, whatever they want to do.  Yeah, I know.  Louie's just riding both sides of the fence here.  I really have a hard time being perfectly honest because it's my union.  Yeah.  Basically, Louie's like, why did you call me? 
[03:33:30]  You obviously don't like me.  Yeah.  Why are you putting me in this position?  No, listen, I don't care.  I really honestly kind of don't.  I mean, I think things like strikes are always annoying because all of a sudden you have to  pretend that everybody that works in any company is a piece of shit and that every writer is  awesome.  That's the part that starts to get painful to listen to.  You know what I'm wondering?  I'm wondering if when this strike is over, there'll just be a backlog of some of the 
[03:34:00]  most brilliantly written programs because the writers will have had so much time to just  sit back and write just amazing stuff.  Well, we talked to the Letterman guys.  They're like, we're not allowed to pick up a pen.  If you're at home, well, true, and you get an idea, you're going to write, you're jotting  it down.  Yeah, no, I mean, I'm sure that you'll see two and a half men turn into the greatest thing  in the American country.  Well, isn't it already? 
[03:34:30]  Stop.  Because the guy had four months off and now he's just going to start kicking ass.  I don't know.  I mean, that's the thing is that the industry that's being shaken here really kind of stinks.  Anyway.  Who is it?  The TV sucks, you know?  Hold on a second.  What happened?  I didn't touch the stool to get down from my bed.  Oh, so then it got ruined, your picture?  Wait a minute.  I can fix it.  You guys, it's not that big a deal.  Look, all you got to do is, look, move them over. 
[03:35:00]  This is better than Leno.  Mary, you can't touch this.  All I'll say about the thing with Letterman is that he really better kick Leno's ass in  the ratings.  Oh, with the writers, yeah.  If it happens the other way around.  If it gets the other way around, it's going to be like, oh, that's weird.  Maybe writers don't matter.  Yeah, that'll look really bad.  Yeah.  Who do you think's eating their balls the most in this strike?  Like, who's the one really getting the shittiest end of the stick? 
[03:35:30]  Um...  Don't say the viewers.  No, not the viewers.  They can do, they can watch, uh, re-repeat through DVDs.  Exactly.  Uh, who's getting the shittiest end of the strike?  I would say that the people that work in television who aren't writers.  Yeah.  Um, I think the, uh, they call them below line, as if you don't want to hurt their feelings  any more than paying them less.  They actually call them below line.  Below line.  That's a wonderful little title.  Oh. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  And, uh, those guys don't get residuals.  Those, like, I, I, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm, uh, my money's a little hype this year because  I can't do a TV project, but right before Christmas, I got a Lucky Louie residual check,  and it saved Christmas.  Oh.  That must be nice.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And, uh, and, uh, you know, so, and again, and I go, you know, if I go to buy a coating  cough syrup with my insurance card, I pay eight cents.  Without it, I pay $150.  Literally, that's the difference.  Wow.  So, I'm doing great. 
[03:36:30]  But the guy who, uh, who runs the camera or the boom operator on Lucky Louie, he's, uh,  the day he stops working is the day he stops having money.  Um, so, and, you know.  Jim Norton.  I would say if there's two more self-centered, the most self-centered, selfish people in television are the two people involved here.  It's the moguls that own the companies and writers.  They're both groups of people that really believe that everything's about them. 
[03:37:00]  And the sad thing is that the most people that work in the industry are just these guys who just have regular jobs, and they're not working now.  They're not even talking.  I mean, there doesn't seem to be even a light at the end of the tunnel on this one.  The issues are so abstract, and there's so many of them, and they're not even talking about it.  No, I mean, the thing the writers are trying to get is securing some sort of rights to money on the Internet. 
[03:37:30]  But that's abstract, even for companies that are firmly entrenched in the Internet.  Still, how much they're making, the overhead?  Nobody makes money on the Internet.  Right.  So I think it's hard for them to consider, given the writers that.  But on the other hand, the companies are pretending.  I mean, the companies are just saying, we'll never give you any money on the Internet.  Right, right.  The writers are saying, we know there's millions of dollars there, and we want half of it. 
[03:38:00]  And the companies are saying, we'll never give you anything, because you'll still only get money from kerosene lamp shadows.  That's all you're giving it.  So you don't even, like, you don't see an end to this anytime soon, obviously.  Well, you know, there'll be an end.  It might be ugly.  It may not be that there's TV again. 
[03:38:30]  I don't know.  No TV.  TV's done.  There'll be some kind of end.  But it is hard to go on strike when some of the most huge shows have no writers involved.  Ah, reality programming.  Yeah, you know, it's hard to compete with that shit.  Yeah.  And in the face of it, to say, ha, see how you like, see how you like your TV without fucking old Christine. 
[03:39:00]  Now, isn't, how long you guys left?  Isn't like a, you really want to watch old Ugly Bettys instead of fresh ones?  Let's see how long you get on that shit, America.  But now, American Idol, don't they use writers for, uh...  Well, there are people that are doing what's essentially writing.  But they haven't been unionized.  So, because everything that happens in a reality show is scripted and edited by writers.  Writers edit television besides, you know, they cast the shows. 
[03:39:30]  They edit them.  So, yeah, those people, and part of what the union's trying to do is make those people unionized.  Right.  And that's also kind of far-fetched.  I agree with everything the writers are trying to get.  Uh, but I guess I don't have much hope that we can force...  The only thing you can do to force companies to do anything is just stop working completely  and just starve the industry out. 
[03:40:00]  I'm not sure what this Letterman-in-between thing is.  I'm not sure.  I really don't get it.  I don't get it.  Do you think people give a shit that much where there'll be some kind of a public outrage  or outcry that'll make the company give in to the writers?  Because as I see it, like you said, there's box sets, there's reruns, there's movies, there's  a shitload of things that I think will go on a lot longer than the writers' money or 
[03:40:30]  patience in this.  And this is...  Here's the thing.  There's no...  This is very different from other strikes.  This is not like a populist labor strike.  Mm-hmm.  This is a negotiation between two people with lots of money.  That'll go on forever.  Yeah.  This isn't like...  Oh, Kitty, that's amazing.  My daughter drew a dog, and it's very good.  It's really good.  Daddy Louie.  That's really good. 
[03:41:00]  If you like bad drawings.  You're despicable.  I love it.  I know.  No, here's the thing.  This is not like guys with no gloves on their fingers over a can that's on fire.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, going like, let's stick together.  Brotherhood.  This is...  This is...  We want more money, and we work...  Other unions stick together to protect the weak in their unions. 
[03:41:30]  Right as a union is very different.  This is a group of people that do something that other people can't do, which is remarkably  right.  90% horrible television, 10% okay.  1% good, 0.0001% excellent.  That's what we can do that no one else can even be trained to do.  Yeah.  Well, you have to ignore her, Kitty.  But so we have leverage because we do something they can't. 
[03:42:00]  That's all it is.  And we're trying to use it to get more money.  Whether we do or not, I don't think it really interests the general public.  Why would it?  I'm interested in the fact that you're not allowed to write, so you babysit.  Well, I take care of my kids, and I go on the road and do stand-up.  I'm very lucky that I'm a comedian.  Yeah.  And I can do that.  But it's like a long snow day.  I love it.  I love that I don't...  I have an excuse not to work.  How was your New Year's Eve show, Lou? 
[03:42:30]  In Raleigh, North Carolina?  Yeah.  It was the greatest night of my entire life.  Spending New Year's Eve in a comedy club in Raleigh.  Good boy.  It was the best thing that ever happened to me.  Oh, shit.  Well...  That I wasn't with, you know...  I wasn't kissing a woman that I know.  All right, Lou, let's start with the fresh talk.  Yeah, you're getting fresh.  Get out there, Louie. 
[03:43:00]  All right, Louie.  Um, well, hang in.  What does everybody say?  Hang in there.  Yeah, whatever.  Yeah, fuck you.  Yeah, whatever.  If you had a gig, could I need a little break of spine?  Right?  You know, we're all better off than a lot of people.  I don't know.  It's most people have flies on their face.  Distended bellies.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  I'm sure they're assholes, too.  I don't think there's anything great about those people.  Yeah, right.  The thing is, the martyrdom of groups like this, it's like after September 11th, we all 
[03:43:30]  had to pretend that there was not a single asshole in either building.  Right.  Which is just not true.  Exactly.  Law averages.  Please.  So, so the writers, you know, I hope we get, I'm in the group, so I really hope we get  what we're asking for, and I support everything that they do, because they're my union, and  I don't work, I don't vote in my union, I don't pay attention, I don't know how we got  these awesome benefits, but we have them, so I tend to go along.  But I don't think that some guy wearing a hard hat should be like, ah, those writers, God 
[03:44:00]  bless them.  I hope they get their third tier residuals on the second quarter of each day.  You know, they're doing it for all of us.  Yeah.  Where would America be without fucking, you know, CSI, whatever, I don't even know how  to watch this shit, but somebody does, so.  Yeah, apparently. 
[03:44:30]  Give us some money.  Well, thank you, Louie.  All right, guys.  Good luck, sweet potato.  Take care of those kids.  Take care of those little angels.

Yeah, what is going on with the beards?  They're all trying this beard thing.  It's just a little weird.  It's a little odd. 
[03:47:30]  Conan dyed his hair.  The devil.  No, he really does.  He has the Satan look to him.  I'm not going on that show.  I'm calling him tomorrow.  I'm not going.

One, two, three, four.  One, two.  I love f**king whatever the amount.  One, two, three, four.  Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.  One, two, three, four.  One, two.  That's the song of the Count.  I f**k the spiders on the wall. 
[03:49:00]  I f**k the cobwebs in the hole.  I f**k the candles on the shelf.  When I'm alone, I f**k myself.  I f**k slowly, slowly, slowly getting faster. 
[03:49:30]  Once I start in f**king, it's very hard to stop.  Faster, faster.  It is so exciting.  I could f**k forever.  F**k until I drop.  One, two, three, four.  One, two, three, four.
