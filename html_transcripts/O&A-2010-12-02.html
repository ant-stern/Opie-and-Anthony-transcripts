<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion of their recent Ozzy Osbourne concert experience.  They detailed the setlist, Osbourne's on-stage antics (including using shaving cream and water), and the overall length of the performance. Opie voiced his preference for concerts focused primarily on hit songs.  This segued into a rant about Sirius XM's baffling policy regarding celebrity autographs.  The removal of Cloris Leachman's autograph from an "unsanctioned" wall near the women's restroom was deemed particularly absurd, highlighting the perceived hypocrisy of the company's image versus its strict rules.  Similar incidents involving Snoop Dogg (whose profane autograph was partially removed) and possibly Paul McCartney or Bruce Springsteen were mentioned, along with numerous caller anecdotes about corporate rigidity and incompetent HR departments.  A humorous tangent involved a David Bowie and Bing Crosby duet video, further emphasizing the absurdity of the situation.  The segment concluded with mentions of an upcoming guest, Jamie Hector, and a video showing Opie's horn-honking encounter with paparazzi harassing Michael Bubl√©.

The next segment focused on the excessive apologies demanded of athletes for emotional outbursts and the increasingly restrictive atmosphere at sporting events.  Anderson's forced apology for a post-game rant and the Cavaliers' ban on anti-LeBron James signs and shirts were discussed, leading to a broader critique of societal over-sensitivity and "pussification."  This transitioned into a rant about the unfairness of the US tax system, referencing Penn & Teller's "Bullshit" show and highlighting the hypocrisy of politicians like Charlie Rangel.  Studio guest Jim Florentine was present throughout this segment, contributing to the often crude and sexually charged humor, including a running joke about Joe DiMaggio's Hefty bag money stash.  A story about a past interaction with Ozzy Osbourne, showcasing his generosity, was shared.  The segment also covered the frustrating merchandise split for their upcoming show with Ozzy Osbourne and concluded with announcements for Florentine's upcoming appearances.

The show continued with Jimmy Norton and Jim Florentine recounting their experiences at Ozzy Osbourne's birthday shows.  Norton described his awkward audience interaction, comparing it to a Barry Manilow concert, and a bizarre incident involving a freeze-dried monkey and Kid Rock.  Florentine, still in the studio, shared stories from touring with Slayer and Megadeth, emphasizing the unwritten rules for positive audience reactions. The conversation then moved to the financial aspects of large-scale music tours and festivals, with a caller, Wayne, providing (later corrected) insider information on the financial arrangements of major touring acts.  Details about union regulations, backstage operations, and venue curfew penalties were discussed.  The segment concluded with jokes about the challenges of parenthood and recollections of the hosts' inappropriate childhood behavior.

Jamie Hector, actor from *The Wire*, joined the show next.  The conversation covered his new film *Night Catches Us*, his role in *The Wire*, his acting process, and the show's realistic portrayal of violence and morality.  They reminisced about working on *The Wire*, discussing specific scenes and the emotional impact of certain plot points.  The conversation also touched upon other films and shows, frequently utilizing casual sexism and vulgar language.

The final segment with Hector focused on his acting process, *The Wire*'s lack of awards recognition despite its critical acclaim and impact, and his personal life, including meetings with Ozzy Osbourne and Ted Danson.  He discussed his martial arts training, auditioning experiences (including a difficult audition for an Alec Baldwin/Meryl Streep movie), the challenges of separating from a role, and his recent fatherhood.  The hosts heavily promoted Hector's movie *Night Catches Us*,  and the conversation included off-color humor and anecdotes, including a joke about a porn website. The segment ended with plugs for everyone's upcoming projects, including a mention of a Harvard course about *The Wire*.

[00:04:00]  it back to uh uh last week and then we'll bring it travel we'll bring it back to um the current day  that is today yeah so on the way out um steve blatter was talking to me outside the men's and  women's bathroom can you see her can you see her signature still yeah yeah sort of okay i was privy  to this conversation as i was running past steve blatter to the elevators i caught some key words  it's truly amazing how much you just don't give a shit about uh meetings with steve blatter it's 
[00:04:30]  just amazing no because i kind of i kind of know what they're about i was i was fighting the good  fight for the show and you and your luggage were flying by i kind of know what they're about i wish i  could do that but uh i'm standing there with steve blatter and you are privy you were walking by  yeah and uh as we're talking i look at the wall like wow cloris leachman signed uh signed her uh  the wall right there right outside the women's bathroom mm-hmm like that's kind of cool and then 
[00:05:00]  i go doris roberts right above her that's kind of cool too doris roberts is a pretty famous uh woman  in her own right not as big as cloris leachman but up there right yeah cloris leachman though  was the big get she won an oscar she was oscar nominated i know nominated i'm not sure if she  actually won she won best support she won she did yeah okay so you're talking about an oscar winner  last picture show oh yes and and you said she won more emmys than anyone alive right eight 
[00:05:30]  emmys she has won if you put in who has won the most emmys the answer is miss cloris leachman  with eight prime time emmy awards uh it's just amazing she is hollywood royalty she is a legend  royalty in the business oh yeah man she's uh yeah she's not some uh scrub celebrity that comes  by we get the scrub celebrities where you know within six months no one's going to give a shit  about of course so uh there's cloris leachman's fine autograph right outside the the the woman's 
[00:06:00]  uh bathroom obviously she was having a good time here and said you know what i'm gonna sign right  here she was on mary tyler moore for christ's sake right yes and and then of course doris roberts  uh signature there as well so i i'm i point that out to bladder and and steve goes yeah but uh they're  gonna remove um her autograph both those autographs i go why and he said well and this isn't steve  bladder he's just a messenger he goes well that's not a sanctioned wall sanctioned wall here at sirius 
[00:06:30]  xm they have sanctioned walls for for celebrity autographs now the whole vibe of the place i guess  they wanted it to be that uh hey man look at the walls they're just covered with celebrity  signatures and there are walls that of course have uh just that yep they have uh they're covered in  this plastic right and on top of the clear plastic plexiglass plexiglass people sign right and uh those 
[00:07:00]  are i guess the sanctioned walls correct um she went off off uh wall yeah off off the oscar winner  the eight emmy award winner yeah decided to sign right outside the women's uh bathroom right outside  the bathroom which isn't a sanctioned wall but the whole thing is that the just the just the idea  that sirius decided they were going to do this thing where they were going to put plastic up and  and have people sign the walls comes off as this kind of oh that's cool you know the whole place 
[00:07:30]  will be covered in signatures at some point it's not that corporate you know there's a vibe of  creativity there's a looseness a looseness but again it is only there's some rebels walking around  this place it is mere illusion of that yeah it's not real it's a fake hipness it's a playroom it's  like saying here here's that little area you can play in that area right there that's what that is  but as soon as you come in here you can't play playing see yeah it's it's a quandary because 
[00:08:00]  you want you want people to think you're hip and cool we'll get to that in a second  uh you can't fake the hipness you can't fake the coolness you can't fake the casualness like they  have a casual friday around here i guess yeah but but the the corporate douches they go out and get  their casual friday attire that makes it so obvious that this is their casual friday attire it's not like  a real casual day it's where you just look in your closet go you know what i usually wear this on the  weekend and if it's casual friday i'm going in with this it's an inner tech that's even casual 
[00:08:30]  friday that's what it is yes that's over the thought process that goes into casual friday even in  this joint and a lot of corporate joints by the way that's why we're bringing this up today  it's so douchey because it's fake yeah fake coolness fake being hip fake fake fake casual yes  so blatter tells me yeah man i mean that that wall will be painted over because that's not a  sanctioned wall i laughed at him like there's no fucking way they're going to paint over chloris 
[00:09:00]  leachman's autograph oh there isn't is there so we uh jimmy and i were walking out yesterday and we  walked by the wall and i i glanced over and i went holy shit they actually removed chloris  leachman's autograph from outside the women's bathroom so then you go through the thought  process yeah who the fuck had a problem with this yeah human resources right in an environment  that is supposed to be so hip and cool and we're rebels we're we're we're we're taking on the  establishment man here here's the deal too it was just to the right of a entrance way into a foyer area 
[00:09:30]  where the men's room and the ladies room are right so you walk through like any place has a two bathrooms  you you walk into the common area and there's a door on one side and a door on the other men's and  ladies right outside that entrance way on the wall is chloris leachman's autograph was and as you can  see from the picture i just tweeted and i don't know if it was an unsanctioned wall if it was because 
[00:10:00]  for some human resources reason it was close to the bathroom no and on the left side when you walk in  the vestibule to the rights the women's to the left is the bench on the left side that wall is sanctioned  there's autographs all there so on one side of this entrance way to the common area to the bathroom is the  sanctioned wall yep and then across this this bathroom mason dixon line there's an unsanctioned wall  correct the corner right there right and that's the wall okay i got you and it's not just it's not just 
[00:10:30]  sanctioned walls like you said earlier it's a plexiglass that's put up on a wall that they have now sanctioned  for autographs yeah okay so they're they're not even officially signing any walls around here no no  it's they sign the plexiglass steve uh blatter told me and uh i can't remember who but it was a  massive star signed another wall in this joint yeah was it paul mccartney out in the front i want to  say it was either paul mccartney or bruce springsteen of that caliber yeah and they had a problem with that 
[00:11:00]  too and finally someone said what the fuck are you doing uh too bad it's not a sanctioned wall it's it's  a paul mccartney autograph or bruce springsteen autograph i forgot which one both both both are  on the same column out front yes and keith richards but they didn't sign the plexiglass right they  signed the actual wall and and they had a problem with that and there was there was discussion that  well we got to paint that we got to paint over that i want to know finally someone said what the  fuck are you doing let's just put plexiglass over these three amazing autographs exactly and that's what 
[00:11:30]  i thought they were going to do maybe with the cloris leachman thing put the plexiglass over the  signatures and then just have people make that a sanction wall people probably won't sign over her  right of course not but whatever uh but but i want to know who passed by saw it and went oh boy oh boy  and then you know what called a meeting you know a meeting was called about the unsanctioned wall  someone's head had a role for allowing somebody to sign the unsanctioned wall it's like we work in a 
[00:12:00]  place where they put on little radio shows it's somebody in human human resources i think was  the answer and i haven't met anybody's human resources possibly have been the problem what  they got that's what i want to know when someone comes up and says we need a meeting there's a  signature on the unsanctioned wall what is the what's going to happen what's the chain of events  to badness that happens because her signature's on that wall there is no chain of events to badness 
[00:12:30]  it is once again somebody justifying their own existence human resource i hate to tell people  human this is in any job yeah human resources if you work for them you're a dirty word  nobody no one likes you looks to human resources as as a good thing gestapo all your gestapo of  the fucking i don't really know who they're protecting company i'll tell you that they are  protecting wimps i guess they are the the the buffer wimps they're one more step to prevent  lawyers from interact that's all they are because they're so afraid of lawsuits yep this is every 
[00:13:00]  corporation that has human resources everything from the narc to the fucking little snot nose safety  patrol at school they're terrible they're all those and and every piece of shit in between all right  i don't know if this guy is serious i got to get him on for a second sean and jersey go ahead  all right good morning uh you can't just let cloris leachman sign where she wants because then  people will start signing all willy-nilly on the floor yeah the light bulbs on the people if they 
[00:13:30]  don't move fast enough thank god you're kidding the funny part is that's probably what they're  thinking whoever came up with this whether it's human resources or someone else it's like who cares  we we do a radio show it's a slippery slope you'll let one play cloris leachman sign and before you  know it some uh walk-on from hello larry is signing before you know it doris roberts is signing  and then another old lady who probably will not be alive to make it back and sign again  yeah who knows next god forbid uh uh what if jean stapleton were to come in oh why would you allow 
[00:14:00]  uh this radio business this entertainment business because it's more than radio to to go so corporate  why would you allow that especially that you should tell someone to shut the fuck up and enjoy the  cloris leachman yes because don't worry about it what's it gonna hurt like ask them quiz them go  what's it gonna hurt because i i i see a lot of autographs around here but that one  for some reason made me go wow cloris leachman to just sign as she was going to the bathroom in  between interviews i'm like that's kind of cool that i work in an environment where that could 
[00:14:30]  happen oh it's not it's too cool obviously so her autograph is completely gone and they went over  the whole wall and doris roberts is still faintly there i tweeted the picture because it's hilarious  i would have loved they're gonna do another coat of paint to make sure that's completely gone  doris roberts isn't uh covered yet she's a two coat uh she's a two coat signature uh cover-up i i would  love to have gotten video or at least have been here to see the guy with the the paint roller and  the fucking pan making that sound with the roller and then and just right over cloris leachman and 
[00:15:00]  he's like a janitor that doesn't have a clue who she is he's just doing his job he was of course i  don't blame him he was told of course i don't blame him at all but you ask the question who saw  this yeah and actually said hey there's a problem i'm valueless at this company aha i see something i  can do now i have something to do i hate that i work for a place where people have a problem with 
[00:15:30]  something like that i hate the fact that i'm in the same environment as people like there's almost no  company you can work for though if that's human resources it's like they're supposed to protect  people like if a woman is being harassed at work you got the right to not be harassed if you're  being harassed racially like you honestly have the right to work without that shit environment but if  that's not go too far well you know i mean actually i had to throw in race for women but if that's what  they think that their job is like that's how somehow they're making the workplace better than their  shit whatever happened to a case-by-case basis this doesn't exist anymore i would almost i would 
[00:16:00]  almost understand if it was some scrub that signed that that you don't even know you're like all  right well do we really want this guy's autograph outside the the women's bathroom i would almost  understand that but chloris fucking leachman it's embarrassing it's just embarrassing her name from  our wall because it's not a sanctioned wall it's not sanctioned sanctioned wall just the idea that  there's a word the two words sanctioned wall is part of the vernacular at this place is retarded 
[00:16:30]  retarded it gets it gets better i just got a note that uh can you put that up there again i guess  snoop dogg oh yeah of course did he sign a sanctioned or unsanctioned wall travis a sanctioned wall  sanctioned wall all right so snoop dogg did the right thing and he signed a sanctioned wall but  there was a problem with his autograph they had to use whiteout because he wrote curse words yeah and  then i guess we can't handle curse words here what what curse words did he write do we know i i'm not 
[00:17:00]  aware uh but i was told that that after they for shizzle perhaps or bitches wouldn't want the gals to be  offended see it's it's it's actually right outside our studio and they moved they moved it over next  to shade 45 oh no it was in the lobby where they white out oh in the lobby so they put they moved  snoop by the black station and that's good that's like a giant cool caricature of like snoop dog yeah 
[00:17:30]  man kind of snoopy snoop dog thing it's a giant it takes up the entire uh piece of plastic did they  really really cool looking do they really white out eric and they they've actually peeled that part of  the plastic off so it's gone what did it say what's it say does anyone know what it said  what i don't know but there's a nice chunk right on off the side there because he didn't take the  original plastic off the plexiglass yeah yeah yeah so he drew all over the covering plastic and they 
[00:18:00]  peeled that part off on the side there what a fucking and this is uh corporate people and all of you  corporate and this is i don't care who you work for yeah what company you're you're basically  repulsive and this is why that's why you're repulsive to people not because you went to  college and not because you make tough decisions because you think that is somehow a part of your  job yeah what did he say fuck some somebody in a human resources job actually saw cloris leachman's 
[00:18:30]  signature and thought that has to go i'm valueless at a company that's my value you got it you got the  the name of a legend wiped off near a toilet that's what your job is you're not making people's lives  better you're not helping people who are being harassed sexually or harassed racially or not being  paid properly or who genuinely are having a tough time that would make you actually a valued member of  any company yep now someone's saying does serious own uh the space who cares if they do or not i'm sure 
[00:19:00]  wait until you're moving i'm sure it's in their lease or whatever that that as long as you put the  place back to how it was nothing to do of course they can paint over when they leave it doesn't  right okay cannot possibly and do they have them resign i'll hate human resources less if they said  if they caught it and they did have them resign somewhere else but i bet they didn't they didn't  i bet you they don't have that legend no she was on fucking mary tyler moore yeah yeah  what's the most shitheads the most emmys won i bet it's some fucking you know it's probably some 
[00:19:30]  dummy of course some college dummy i would love who didn't know who she was i'd love to know but  you know what you'll never know in this day and age you never know i know but cover up they pass  let's go through let's go through the process yeah let's go through the process yeah let's go through  the process who do we ask i need to know more yeah let's dig deep and find out let's watch them  scramble they like when we do expose so this is our expose today who decided that the cloris  leishman thing had to be uh covered up i will guarantee you it it had nothing to do with mel 
[00:20:00]  carmerson who's running this company he don't care he doesn't care if cloris leishman signed a wall  outside the women's bathroom no he comes from a very uh and he's the he's the main guy right  artistic background someone below him infinity broadcasting the rebellious kind of thing  and i can't see that bothering him i can see if she signed mel's window with with a marker yeah  yeah yeah that might be a problem snoop through a put a gang sign on mel's window all right then  you got to take that down like it's a subway uh window yeah that's called scratch scratch edie 
[00:20:30]  scratch edie on mel's window then maybe sure that could be a problem yeah then you got to fix that  i love to know who and it's hilarious that doris roberts is just faintly there because they got  to get another she's fading out like the back to the future picture yes  yeah it's like the back to the future oh cloris leishman trained with brando in the fucking 40s  yeah yeah oh that's there you go that's good but someone decided to have a little power trip in and  and and show the world who's boss by the way okay so let's go you're right it was not mel had nothing 
[00:21:00]  to do with no fucking no who's under mel it's the it was by the way because they're not even going to  understand this break because we get in so much fucking trouble when we talk about the company  this is something that everyone listening to our voices just about everyone listening to our voices  can relate to and that's what we do on the show is relate to our listeners so why don't you just  relax it's it's we're not beating up the company we're beating up what what has become this corporate  environment which is very uncomfortable for most people and why corporations and why there's no  humanity left of them we always talk about that but it's little shit like that that really it just 
[00:21:30]  makes you sick to your stomach it's got to do with the pay got to do with benefits it's that  he rocked um i don't know what it was that they whited out and ripped out but somewhere else on the  drawing there's the word shit is still on there oh yeah so whatever it was on that side it probably  was worse than shit ah maybe they said it might have been n-i-g-g-a or was it an actual accidental  rip no it it it doesn't look like somebody actually hit the side it looks like did they cut it to have 
[00:22:00]  to get the thing in the wall no because the other ones you it's just a little uh this is the snoop  dog yeah it's a little patch thing you can just out there where is it iraq i'm very good at  interpreting graffiti oh all right there goes jimmy it's like worked with a gang for euro or  you might have seen my tags all over the subway cars titty boy kid  kid uh let me go to john in brooklyn john  hey good morning john listen i work for cod edison and let me tell you something the human 
[00:22:30]  resource company that the human resource department in our company it's like they took  all the carlton black guys all the gays everybody in that one department and everybody's so scared  to go to them for anything it's like if anything happens in our department we can't go to human  resources because they're afraid what they're gonna do because they got no hearts and it's all  they want to do is kill us whatever you never want to go to human resources that's like going  to the principal's office it's probably you don't want to go i would imagine human resources i i hate 
[00:23:00]  to say this was probably a good idea to turn that off when it first came around it was probably a good  concept everything but then it just got was a good idea until it's been perverted exactly and then it  was perverted yes jimmy jimmy has just studied the snoop dog autograph it looks like the entire  like the entire piece of plexiglass was covered and snoop just drew on like it's on the cover  and i didn't realize that snoop did the whole thing wait what does it say because someone might  it says a lot that snoop drew the whole fucking thing you're on there's profanity on hold on 
[00:23:30]  carolina man and if this is true this is even crazier he goes uh opa i'm gonna harbor a guess  about snoop bitches ain't shit but hose uh and tricks i don't think it's no and then of course he  writes that's a well-known lyric so he might have just wrote a well-known lyric down and they  they said oh we got to clean this up not enough room for that to have been like little and it says  i'm the shit a few times it does say that on the wall so it might not be for that reason that's why  they had to move it probably yeah but they didn't they didn't it's not like they took the profanity 
[00:24:00]  out there's something in like three quarters down the left side it's not that big of a triangle  missing and it's over where a screw is but it does look like it was cut but the it's a sloppy  cut so it's almost like if they cut they would have just taken scissors and snipped yeah i don't  know exactly what snipped snoop yeah they're dumb to have moved it by shade in the corner though it's  just it's like it was if snoop did all that yeah put it by the black station but that's it that's 
[00:24:30]  it's amazing that's the thinking though pretty much it is they're thinking we'll make the blacks  comfortable we'll put this over here they're so out of touch let's say hi to uh rich in north  carolina rich yeah i think jesse ventura needs to get to the bottom of this i won't be your puppet  sir maybe it'll come out on wiki leaks yes maybe we get jesse which snoop wrote maybe jesse walks  the hallways today with the ultimate warrior uh let's go to frank in manhattan frank good morning

[00:26:30]  enlighten me your job i know you don't want to be a dirty word to your employees yeah and and don't  just go over the basic line of we're here to make sure that people aren't harassed or anything it's  like not i understand your cover story right but but what is the reason why a signature can't be on  a wall and just explain some of that stuff to me some of the more in-depth things that you guys do  that people just see as inane ridiculous unnecessary drivel sure hr is just puffin stuff they're just 
[00:27:00]  terrible he's your friend when things get rough they're just terrible this guy was contracted to  remove the snoop signature these people sean in north carolina sean i believe sean go ahead sean  uh yeah i was contracted to remove the uh signature that snoop and i'm actually looking at it right now  and it says uh e-rock is a fat piece of and that oh boy i'm so happy his phone cut out i am too 
[00:27:30]  i i wished it would have been because a nuclear explosion happened or even heard a high-pitched  squeal as his phone melted or something a little less like him just having a stroke while he was  driving his 18 wheeler by a schoolyard and with a gas can in his hand uh don in jersey don is that  don on the phone it is in jersey the don yes maybe maybe hey simple question who the fuck his daughter  is robert she's the mother on everybody loves raymond she's the mother on every hit sitcom damn please i 
[00:28:00]  think they've moved her around a few times over the years right she's been on but but even on  and everybody loves raymond i mean it's one of the most successful sitcoms in history yeah and  she's done way more than just that too she's been around forever she's the seller one years ago she  wanted no part of me when i took a picture with her really nothing to do with me well then fuck her  paint over her name i did all right man uh chisel from pa uh yeah i wanted to let you guys know 
[00:28:30]  that you gotta be careful that it could be thermite paint oh that they painted over it with  through my never know you better protect yourself tell us that's how they got into the trade center  to set the charges it was first they sent in celebrities to sign the walls and then they  came in with thermite paint to cover it and the employees just thought it was human resources  if i were you i'd be suspect of your own building i know i was a navy seal a former governor a fighter 
[00:29:00]  shut up i hate him you just don't have to do the impression and then you won't be annoyed i know but  i do damn so that's the story of cloris leachman just it's just amazing to us ah there was a whole  thing that went on with that i just like you said there was a there was a meeting with a really big  table at me maybe a closed door meeting somewhere me and travis speculating someone's head rolled 
[00:29:30]  because of this you think someone had to at least have gotten a reprimand or censure you think somebody  had to go home to their wife a month before christmas yeah yeah and tell them they don't have a job  anymore i don't have a job anymore i got fired what happened what did you do you must have done  something uh uh cloris leachman signed a unsanctioned wall and someone's head had a and i was the one  that um had to take responsibility i knew nothing about it but it was one of my men and i take 
[00:30:00]  responsibility like the lieutenant taking responsibility for the soldier he had to throw himself on the  grenade i bet i bet it didn't even get down to that i bet you literally it was just they said  something like you know thank you for my sandwich mr intern and then when they said that i want to  make a big deal they probably said something like you know that's not a sanctioned wall and then then  the people panic yeah because somebody from hr said that it wasn't a sanctioned wall and then i bet 
[00:30:30]  that's all it took i'll bet you it was just somebody from hr they just they come into the  room like an odor somebody from hr that's what they are you smell something like there was a fire here  wasn't it it's like if somebody took a shit in the corner yeah you can't really see it but you know  yeah or something burning yeah what is that just the corporate environment is exhausting i i mean we  told the story of the the coat hanger behind me right the uh that was last year pronged coat hanger 
[00:31:00]  that opie wanted behind him to hang his coat on for all of us actually i said we need a coat  hanger here but it was winter time last year i said it would be nice to have somewhere to hang  our coats in the studio the the email chain that went back and forth to get this done  was mind-boggling first it was no it can't go it was a complete no a complete no you can't get one  and then we actually asked why and i guess they really couldn't come up with an answer it was one of 
[00:31:30]  those things like there must have been a meeting discussing what the answer could be to why we  can't have a coat hook and then and they could not but even them in their genius of being able to come  up with no's for everything could not figure out how to say no to a coat hanger try to go with uh it'll  affect the acoustics in the studio i remember that yes they did that's that's right i go do you realize  the horse shit we do every day yeah does it really matter area of that is probably 10 square  inches and it's like it's just it's it's nothing he didn't want to hang on a bass drum with the 
[00:32:00]  yeah and then they had to do all sorts of research to figure out which coat hanger to buy yeah yeah  that was it would be suitable for this studio the acoustics the corporate environment the building  yeah it can't offend anybody i believe obama had to sign off on it eventually it can't leave any  damage to your coat unless you sue oh yeah the lawyers probably had to look at at the actual peg in  it and make sure it couldn't damage your hood i mean things get done eventually but it takes forever 
[00:32:30]  oh god because it just got to go through the the red tape it has to go through the corporate sludge it  utter craziness so goodbye cloris leach ma'am sorry that you signed an unsanctioned wall glad to  know you bon voyage i'm really sorry and doris roberts you got maybe one more day left on the  unsanctioned wall looks like you got one day of drying and another coat that'll cover that up i did  tweet the picture if you look very closely you'll see doris roberts is just about it's fantastic you 
[00:33:00]  think the guy that painted you think he painted over it and as he was leaving he threw his hat up in the  air as he walked out of the building we're gonna paint it after all  it's just it makes no sense no let's say hi to eddie in jersey eddie what's going on guys hey  hey guys i just want to point out something only in corporate world where it's a white-owned company 
[00:33:30]  they have to tow the line and other stations like c100 and you know the darky kind of stations  they've got a billboard with the jingle bell rocking christmas eve bullshit  rye carries up there a couple of darkies on the billboard oh my god why what is it we got it  with the dark what does it have to do with all the billboard has nothing to do with anything  oh easy rev it out back down all right no one you're making no sense no one's offended by your 
[00:34:00]  rebellious attitude no no no one is like whoa easy we're gonna get in trouble we don't know what  you're saying i think it's racist ever and we don't i'm just we don't understand i'm not getting  you we don't understand the point sir i'll go back to home human resources when i get done with drive  my truck okay bush but if you look at the billboard they got bing crosby up there nice guy he's painted  red like the devil he's not a nice guy he used to beat his kids he sucked he was shit he used to  get drunk and beat his kid fuck bing crosby after being beaten by a guy that's wearing a straw hat how 
[00:34:30]  horrible would that be he really made it hurt because then he would go on tv and sing all those  really nice family christmas songs yeah yeah as the as his kids are at home tending to their wounds  just slugging his kid in the face as he goes with his pipe  bad example sir bing crosby bad example yeah okay okay enjoy your day guys i just wanted to point it 
[00:35:00]  out i don't know what you pointed out he pointed out that bing crosby was painted like the devil  he pointed out that line five should be ripped the fuck out of the phone bank what's the problem  with bing being painted red because all the other people have nice pictures mark carrie looks  semi-thin other people nice pictures but then bing crosby old christmas style his skin is so red he  looks like the devil it's obvious that they pointed out i really i i even give up to me you're looking 
[00:35:30]  for something there first of all bing crosby is he really being played on z100 yeah right i mean uh  and and if anything a black station you want to see a darky station or a lot looser because they're  not as uptight as fucking corporate white sissies no i know they're not but i'm saying in general  you you probably wouldn't have that type of obsession over corporate nonsense  at a black station because they're not as uptight he was just trying something hey could you uh i this 
[00:36:00]  is one of my favorite videos knowing that bing crosby could you start it over i like the little  chit chat they have the little chit chat between david bowie and bing crosby about having families  and stuff yeah this of course the holiday season is around yeah bing answers the door and here comes  david bowie he just wiped his hands off like he'd just freshly beaten one of his kids yeah  you the new butler well it's been a long time since i've been the new anything what's happened  to now this queer comes in yeah he does that a lot doesn't he um oh i'm david bowie i live down 
[00:36:30]  the road oh sir percival lets me use his piano when he's not around he's not around is he i can  honestly say i haven't seen him but come on in come here he grabs him and muscles him in come on in  my daughter's crying in the corner  he wants him to play the piano to drown out the screams from upstairs you play the piano i'm gonna go  beat my children  right or wrong i sing either way 
[00:37:00]  well i sing too  oh good what kind of singing  well mostly the contemporary stuff do you uh do you like modern music  oh i think it's marvelous some of it really fine  tell me uh you ever listen to any of the older fellas i betcha he could be more modern like uh  john lennon and the other one with um harry nelson  oh you go back that far huh  oh yeah i'm not as young as i look none of us is these days  in fact i've got a six-year-old son  and he really gets excited  oh well why don't i teach you how to put one in the old bread basket 
[00:37:30]  pause that for one second  go back go back to david what was saying that  and then pause it  you go in for any of the traditional things in this  not from the beginning of the sketch  oh yeah most of them really  no we need the uh  presents  yeah go back  it's just hard  yeah there you go  in fact i've got a six-year-old son 
[00:38:00]  do you punch him in the face  he just sincerely looks at him  do you slug him  you gotta you gotta punch a kid  let him know who's boss  in fact i've got a six-year-old son  and he really gets excited  how'd a fag like you have a son  do you throw your cum into a vagina  do you drive by and throw it like multiple migs  do Mick Jagger vomit in a girl's vagina 
[00:38:30]  see because he swallowed all his cum  i was just seeing if you're paying  actually uh  our family do most of the things that other families do  we sing the same song  do you  yeah  i even have a go at white christmas  you do huh  ah ha ha  Bing song  stop it  do you know this one  oh i do indeed  it's a lovely thing  sure  little drummer boy  it's where you take a boy  and beat on him like a drum  oh here he goes  where's the rest of the band coming from  it's just us 
[00:39:00]  this was such a big deal  how does it sound  you never heard this  this video played  terrible  every hour  okay give a little  on mtv  a newborn king to see  our finest gifts we bring  see a kid in the background  with a bloody nose  and a steak over his eye  running into the scene  like the kid from luca brazi  is giving the gift  to don corleone  what the hell are you doing 
[00:39:30]  to my song  let me punch you  i like punching him  in the ear  leaves are ringing  for quite a while  like christmas bevel  bo bo bo  bo bo bo  he was a good christmas song singer  of course  they just um  don't look right together 
[00:40:00]  yeah they're trying something with that  they certainly were  they sound okay though  yeah it's alright  i'd like to hate that  what year is that  like 1978  that's like early 80s  i would guess  i'll go 80 or 81  77  oh wow  77  that was pre-mtv and everything  good job  yeah that was like  one of bing's  i always thought it was like  the mtv thing  no that was one of bing's  specials  he died a month later  bing did  wow  well no  david bowie  wow  i was still alive 
[00:40:30]  for gory  that was a great question  wow  wow  wow  ah shit  a rough start  originally recorded on  uh  september 11th  1977  september 11th  ah another disaster  yes  bing looks pretty healthy  i know  what happened  died a month later  i believe on a golf course  right  of a heart attack  right after he finished  his round  on a golf course  right  i think it was right  after he finished his round  yeah  did bill murray  throw his fucking club  down and run off the 
[00:41:00]  off the course  i think that's how we lost  the great bing crosby  the great bing  died a month later  and  you could uh  still almost hear the  cheers of his children  you listen closely  yeah  all right  why don't we take our  first break  uh  another busy show today  we got jamie hector  coming in  yes  marlo from the wire  for anyone that doesn't  know his uh  real name  i'm so happy  he's a hard one to get  man he's uh  we tried to get him  when the wire was going  off and hbo was not  good with getting us 
[00:41:30]  guys from the wire  we get a lot of wire  guys  no but they were not  particularly great with  getting some of the guys  we wanted  oh okay  he was hard to get  yeah  and jim florentine  stopping in in about  a half hour or so  yes  and he went to aussie  with you last night  a few people were  actually uh  skeptics uh  about my story  of uh  the paparazzi guy  no they weren't  you know there were a  couple that were  skeptical  people like  yeah it was you know  anthony told his story  and everything but  uh  i don't know if that 
[00:42:00]  happened  well someone actually  found audio  uh  and video  of uh  who was coming out  of the today show  and it was  it was mike  michael bubley  right michael bubley  that was coming out  uh  and  someone has video  and you just hear  my horn  wailing  over the entire  fucking time  that they're  photographing him  and videotaping him  coming out  and uh  no video of your  truck unfortunately  but it's very obvious  no you hear it  and then you can 
[00:42:30]  actually  just like you said  you were doing  you can hear me say  move your fucking car  oh god  fuck your mother  it's very hard to hear  it's like you almost  need like a sound  analysis guy  if you know where it is  um  you can hear it  and then michael bubley  actually goes  he goes  shh everybody  listen  an angry  listen to the angry  new yorker out there  cursing  oh let's hear it  oh yeah  I have to hear it  it's great  we should get the  acoustic guys who did  the kennedy assassination  really fast  because we have a  different audience  every fucking day  basically you were  driving home 
[00:43:00]  two days ago  oh two days ago  and a paparazzi  decided to stop his car  in the middle of the  fucking road  because he needed a picture  of obviously now  michael bubley  he was waiting there  I guess to get a parking  spot or something  and there was no parking  believe me  it was full  full up  and then michael bubley  started coming out  he jumped out of his  fucking car  and left it in the  middle of the street  and no one could go  anywhere  and I'm just  I was so  I go  where are you going  move your fucking car  and he wasn't paying  attention  he's snapping pictures  trying to get the good  michael bubley picture 
[00:43:30]  and I just laid on the horn  a little while later  I'm cursing him  I'm cursing his mother  and then I just  inched up  tapped his bumper  and pushed his car  down the street  started pushing his car  down the street  with my escalator  pushing the Celica  down the street  so he could get by  and he then  started getting pissed  and ran back to his car  and I'm like  good you motherfucker  here's the set up  and now from  now you see  the michael bubley here  you can see it  for yourself on YouTube  you'll hear the horn  in the background  that's just me 
[00:44:00]  laying on the horn  the whole time  and then they cut it  and he's taking pictures  hey guys  aren't you guys cool  I've been waiting  for a long time man 
[00:44:30]  thank you  thank you  listen listen  listen  listen to the swearing  and angry  in New York  thank you  Mike  we thought while you saw  can we get some photos  you guys  you can hear it  in the background  the horn is amazing  I was in the background  and the only reason  it faded out  or it stopped  was because they cut  to a later part  they edited this video 
[00:45:00]  oh really  but I laid on that horn  for probably twice as long  as you just heard it there  dude that was  and also  he actually seems like  a really nice guy  how great is that  to hear your horn  offending everybody  he had to acknowledge  the horn  and then at the very end  you do see  me drive by  you see me  like  where in the window  no no  because they turn  the camera around  and look  now you see  the escalade  he gets into  but look  right over the hood  of his escalade  watch  watch what drives by  first the idiot's car 
[00:45:30]  just pull over  and that's me  there you go  that's me driving by  they found it  yeah there it is  there it is  that asshole  can I  my chick  had worked  as a PA  on a movie  and I told her  your pop  and one of her jobs  was to stop paparazzi  from taking photos  it's really hard to do  because they know  they're right  they really are  garbage  but they're hard  to fuck with  and  wow  did we have a nice  talk about what  fucking  just scum of the earth 
[00:46:00]  they are  despicable people  they are  horrid people  despicable  awful  there it is  is that me right there  yeah there I am  that's me  look at that  you should tweet  that picture  right there  Michael Buble  getting in his escalade  and you flying by  in the background  that's the shit  you should tweet  right there  yeah that's the  that's the picture  all right  that was fun  after the break  we have today's  apology  every day  every day someone  has to apologize 
[00:46:30]  in the media  so we got today's  apology  why did I just  say that like  the whole  I really did  no  no  this is the  O.P.N.3 show  you want to feel  old today  Britney Spears 
[00:47:00]  is 29  yeah  exactly  exactly  because it  brings back  the memories  of us  putting up  Britney Spears  posters in our  office at  NEW  and the  sales people  and people  in general  would come in  and go  what's wrong  with you  fuck  they're horrified  because she was  she's a teenager  underage  she was underage  right  I guess so  yeah  she's 29  today  29  wow  that time  does blast  on by 
[00:47:30]  doesn't it  my god  man  the awkward  looks when they  came into that  old office  man  we haven't had  an office  in years  I have not  been in  an office  I remember  when we first  got here  they said  alright here's  your studio  and then here's  your office  down the hall  and they showed  me like  here's where  you'll sit  and this  and I knew  I'd never  go in there  no I  and it goes  back to what  we talked  about earlier  really quickly  corporately  we don't want  to hang out  I don't need  to be down  that end 
[00:48:00]  hell fucking  no  or the building  it's really  healthy for the  show to get  the hell out  of the corporate  environment  quickly  yeah  it really is  no joke  anymore  that's really  what it's  about  because as soon  as they walk  down the hall  you know  there's some  kind of issue  that shouldn't  be an issue  some dumb  little problem  some just  stupid little  thing  but at  NEW  we loved  our office  because it  still wasn't  as corporate  as this whole  thing has become  as corporate  our office  at NEW  was just  debauchery  could you imagine  having that office  here 
[00:48:30]  no  oh well  we did the  discussion  where they  had a problem  with them  with Kenny  heating up  pop tarts  in one of  our office  spaces  remember that  I think we  got past that  eventually  after a long  email chain  and meetings  and whatever  Jesus  but  imagine our  old office  with the  J√§germeister  machine  in the office  we had  three refrigerators  two for beer  one for food  we would sit  there and drink  beer  in the office  after the show  because  God knows 
[00:49:00]  I didn't want  to go home  that was for sure  I wasn't going  home  at least not  sober  I wanted to be  on equal footing  once I got home  and I would  just sit there  and play video  games  on the computer  that I had  on my little  desk  and drink  beer  and smoke  like crazy  I forgot  the smoking  everyone smoked  so like  we usually  we were pretty  courteous  we waited  until you  and other 
[00:49:30]  non-smokers  would leave  but then  the place  just turned  into  and it was  a party  going on  in that  fucking place  at night  naked broads  sometimes we  would leave  there at  don't forget  about the  naked broads  at like  10 o'clock  at night  or something  after being  in there  until 7 o'clock  from 7  till 10  at night  just drinking  bullshit  and laughing  on balls  off  smoking  and then  there was  some people  that would  smoke some  marijuana  down the hall 
[00:50:00]  then it was  the after show  I mean  if these girls  are coming  all the way  from Philly  to do a bit  on the show  why go home  right away  when you could  hang out  in the office  and party  a little bit  why  of course  and Ron and Fez  would come on  and then they'd  come back  to their office  and the party  would continue  Fridays were  totally twisted  in that place  E-Rock says  he has old  pictures of our  office  I haven't seen  the pictures  in a long time  really  I gotta see those  what did he  scan your hard drive  for them  maybe E-Rock  come on  E-Rock  E-Rock  picked up the mic 
[00:50:30]  to say something  and then I interrupted  and he just  threw the mic away  I'm sorry  I'm sorry Eric  don't throw the mic away  make believe  it's a hero  by that he means  Hulk Hogan  he said yum  he did say yum  where are these pictures  going to be  I'll put them up  on Twitter  in a little bit  what account  you got like  a hundred accounts  should everybody  just scroll through  Twitter starting with A  and go to Zbisco  and let's see them first  so make sure  there's nothing incriminating  I'll put them up  on OA photos  make sure  make sure they're safe  yeah  well 
[00:51:00]  Anthony's desk  might be a problem  why  you had the  you had the  Olsen twin stuff  up on your desk  some of the  where's the problem  the dolls  in suggestive poses  oh that's fine  yeah that's good  and then you had  like a body cast  where it's just  breasts and a vagina  hanging on the wall  hanging on the wall  I remember that  I remember that bit  yeah remember that  god  why not cast  a naked body  could you imagine  the shit that we had  in that office  that's why  that's why we have  such a problem  we've been around  long enough to 
[00:51:30]  understand what it  used to be  and what it has become  so I do apologize  to people  but it's  it's mind boggling  yeah  the shit we used to do  a mere ten years ago  eight years ago  I hear now  people are being told  to remove  their stuff  from the air  conditioning vent  why  I guess it blocks  the air conditioning  yeah  you don't want to do that  no of course not  someone's gotta  you know  but now we don't  even have an office  officially  no no  there's nothing  we technically  have a little space  down the hall  but we don't sit there  we just can't  I go to my office 
[00:52:00]  after the show  for a very short  period of time  it goes down  36 floors  my little office  and then I walk  out of it  right  and I'm on ground level  it's fantastic  it's just  best office ever  it's just different  it's still great  to do radio  very different  it's very very different  the atmosphere  we are  I can't wait to see  the old office photos  I remember like you said  the Olsen twins poster  I had the Britney Spears poster 
[00:52:30]  oh  an amazing gaming system  you had for the time  so you could play all your games  on the computer  mm-hmm  hmm  remember what it looked like  after the sex for Sam  oh my god  I don't know what the fuck  they were looking for  but holy shit  do you have those photos  Z-Rock  I'm looking for those  that looked like  one of those movies  where someone breaks  into someone's house  and ransacks it  they were praying  that we had kiddie porn  or something man  they were looking for something  because they completely  destroyed our office 
[00:53:00]  after we did the  sex for Sam bit  I took my computer home  and they asked me  to bring it back  oh really  and I was like  oh sorry  I already just  I wiped the hard drive  it's done  I go there's nothing  to take back  mm-hmm  good  yeah screw that  they destroyed it  oh Iraq  I'm going through the photos here  like Travis said  you know  they don't want us  to have anything  on the air conditioning vents  yeah  well apparently  on the old air conditioning vents  you stored a lot  of your empty  vodka bottles  Jaeger bottles 
[00:53:30]  Jack Daniels  Canada dry seltzer  for some reason  a mixer  and it looks like  you had one of those  water balloon slingshots  oh yeah  we did  we did  we had one of those  I think we launched one  in the office one day  against the window  are the photos pretty good  I haven't seen them in years  there's one here  where it's just a bunch of  naked Olsen dolls  laying on top  of Anthony's monitor  and one is giving  Sergeant Hartman  a blowjob  yeah we have 
[00:54:00]  the Sergeant Hartman dolls  I remember that  I got a photo of that too  and isn't one in a wheelchair  I remember having one doll  in a wheelchair  and we pulled her leg off  and then had Sergeant  Gunnery Sergeant Hartman  giving her cunnilingus  in the wheelchair  you think they would have  a problem with those dolls  around here  I think so  she doesn't mean pussy  that's why  no  what is he doing  and it never changes  even back then  we were thinking  how stuffy the environment was  oh my god  I wish we had that  environment back  murder  murder  got away with murder  the Gunnery Sergeant 
[00:54:30]  was licking her vagina  Sam  even though it smelled  like ass  from sitting in a wheelchair  oh my god  well would this be the photo  you're referring to guys  which one  hold on  this one  oh  Jimmy has some photos  yeah  if Jimmy's computer  would fucking  buck up  oh  is it bucking  oh yeah  there you go  oh that's right  it's um  Gunnery Sergeant  Hartman  is sitting on my 
[00:55:00]  computer monitor  of course um  I believe  EverQuest is on  underneath it  because I was  playing video games  uh  and he's getting  head  from one of the  Olsen twin dolls  as he's fingering  Barbie  uh  with the other hand  and they're sitting  on a big  Timmy doll  and his pants  are down at his knees  I actually had that  fucking  I actually had that  doll  the Gunnery Sergeant  Hartman doll  for years  sitting on my  uh  not that one  but my own copy  the Arlie Ermey doll  yes  classic  and I remember  taking a picture 
[00:55:30]  of this going  this is great  I didn't realize  and there's a  Planet of the Apes  poster behind  yeah  uh  from 2001  yeah that was  when the movie  that was before  the movie came out  they gave us  the movie posters  and we're like  I hope this is good  I hope this movie's good  and then it ended up  sucking  yeah well  what are you  gonna do  god damn man  alright anyway  moving on  shit  we uh  we have today's  apology  oh  waddle a doodle  remember Arizona  Cardinals quarterback  Derek Anderson  we played it the other day  is that the one  who was talking  or laughing  off the sidelines 
[00:56:00]  while they were  losing on Monday Night Football  you got it  well here's how  it went down  and then we'll get  to the apology  what were you saying  in that instance  that you were trying  to be positive  that was funny  and I don't mean  this to be  sarcastic  or pointed  but I mean  that went out  on Monday Night Television  a lot of fans  talking about it  right now  is a big problem  with this team  can you put into context  what was going on  at that moment  what caused you  what Deuce and I  talk about  is nobody else's business  but why was something  funny when you're down  18 points  in the fourth quarter  it wasn't funny 
[00:56:30]  I wasn't laughing  about anything  the camera showed you  laughing  okay that's fine  that's fine  that's fine  that's fine  that's fine  I'm not laughing about it  you think this is funny  I take this shit serious  I'm not  real serious  I put my heart and soul  into this shit  every single week  all I'm saying is  the camera showed you  I'm just telling you  right now  what I do  every single week  every single week  I put my freaking  heart and soul  into this  I study my ass off  I don't go out there  and laugh  it's not funny  nothing's funny to me  I don't want to go out there  and embarrass me  football in front of everybody  that's why I'm asking you 
[00:57:00]  I'm telling you right now  we're not  we're talking  Deuce and I are talking  what was the context  I'm done  sorry  he's taking defensive  position  first this is why  this fucking reporter  is a cunt  he answered his question  what Deuce and I  talk about  is nobody's business  that was the answer  to the question  but the pussy reporter  wanted detail  it's like what do you  talk about while you  fuck your wife  how about we talk  about that reporter  you ever chuckle  during that  yeah what do you  when you talk about  what do you talk about  how do you fuck your wife  it's private  I'd like to know 
[00:57:30]  the guy answered  that fucking pussy  reporter's question  he goes  it's nobody's business  and he didn't like that  so then he got shitty  none of your god damn business  then he got shitty  and he goes  well I just was wondering  because you were down 18  at first he goes  well I don't want to try  to say anything  I'm not  and then he sets it up  real soft  and meanwhile he's saying  exactly what he's saying  he's not saying  and the guy says  what Deuce not talking about  is nobody's business  that was your answer  but then he fucking  then he snuck in a punch  well it was your dad  18 nothing  and more importantly  it was a moment 
[00:58:00]  the guy's very emotional  but you're not allowed  to do that in today's society  no not in sports  in the media in general  but honestly  ugh  right so now the guy  has to apologize  Anderson apologizes  for post game rant  my mom and dad  didn't raise me  to act like that  in times of adversity  he said  someone made him  apologize obviously  oh yes  let's try to do this  in a manner that  doesn't end up  all over YouTube  if we can  he said  obviously I was frustrated  by what had happened  during the game  and I let my emotions  get away from me 
[00:58:30]  I've been through  some rough times  in football  Anderson said  but I think it's obviously  one of the most frustrating  times for me  a game that I felt like  going in  that we were very prepared  for  at a very good week  of practice  like I said  and to lay an egg  on national TV  was not only frustrating  for me  but frustrating  to every one of the guys  that's out there  every single day  and sees what we're  capable of doing  he was forced  to do that  it's a shame  every apology  is forced by somebody  yeah it's a shame  that these guys  can't just speak  their minds  in sports 
[00:59:00]  on TV  in general  you're just not a lot  to do it  he was fucking jabbing  him with some questions  he wasn't happy with  and he laid into them  fuck it  and believe me  I don't like hearing  a big dumb  fucking jock  trying to deflect  because the truth  of the matter is  he was chuckling  and they were 18 points  now  but the thing is  it's like  but who cares  who cares  because it's not  yeah  he's not watching  children being massacred  and laughing  it's a fucking game  oh Uncle Paul  it's a game 
[00:59:30]  it's a fucking game  sure  so who cares  if he's laughing  another apology  that doesn't need  to be done  lots of those  oh if I disagree  I think that  if you blow up  you have to say sorry  well that's true  I know you guys  aren't basketball fans  but today's the day  to watch a little NBA  oh yeah  LeBron goes back to Cleveland  I even know that  and I hate basketball  I'm telling you  it's going to be a circus  yeah  it really is going to be a circus  because that owner up there  is not happy  that LeBron left  so he's going to  he's going to allow some things  they  well no 
[01:00:00]  they said that the  the arena  whatever they call basketball  where do they play in  an arena  sure  they said that there's going to be  unbelievable security  metal detectors  all kinds of that  what not  and no  insulting  signs  or shirts  allowed  oh god  no insulting  signs  or shirts  allowed  what is going on  why are they taking that away  from everybody  because they're pussies  they started  and not even just a  fuck your mother sign 
[01:00:30]  right  you know  it's something that's a little  clever  that bashes them  I bet they take  every fucking thing  well they're using the word  queen instead of king  with LeBron  so I bet you  they won't allow those  yeah  they won't let that  meanwhile  Ty Cobb  used to live for the boos  he loved when the opposing team  would boo  oh  oh sorry  I misunderstood  and the same type  that I'm talking about  with him  from the crowd  exactly  but  opposing players say  that the greatest feeling 
[01:01:00]  they get  and it's a lot of times  it's not even just the cheers  of their team  it's the silence  of an opposing  rivals  crowd  when you hurt  like when you  shut them up  when you shut them up  when you shut up the boos  it's the silence  of hitting a home run  or of scoring  in your fucking rivals  that's  the greatest satisfaction  Sonic just goes  so why are they taking  why are they taking away  the insulting signs  and stuff  why  they don't  who does that hurt  because  the player that's making  about a hundred  fucking million dollars a year 
[01:01:30]  no they think  it will incite  violence  which it is  a basketball game  how is it  incite  how is that  again incite  violence  when everyone's  on the same side  with this issue  in Cleveland  anyway  there'll be a few  knuckleheads  that are like  yeah I'm psyched  that he left  our fucking team  and went to Miami  but in general  everyone's on the same side  yeah  they don't want  any violent atmosphere  so  that's what they're doing  no signs  no shirts  they did it  with your Yankees  with the rivalry 
[01:02:00]  with the Red Sox  they started taking away  all those shirts  both sides had great  clever shirts  for those series  and they're starting  to make sure  you don't wear those  to the baseball games  it's a family event  you don't want to  it's not a family event  let's keep it nice  let's keep it nice  it's a family event  but it's also  an adult event  oh now  let's just keep it nice  now  it's a game  and everyone  should be nice  you said it perfectly  years ago  when you said  we're protecting  the children  and sacrificing  adults  adult fun  and entertainment 
[01:02:30]  the whole world  doesn't revolve around  old uncle Paul  children  no I was just  doodling  and you know what  diddling  my point of reference  has not changed at all  having a son  yeah  I'm still right there  with you  I'm still right there  with you though  we go so far  to protect the children  that we're sacrificing  our own enjoyment  and have some  adult fucking entertainment  that you don't have to  immediately condemn  because the children  won't  how great would it be 
[01:03:00]  if you're up  up there in Cleveland  and you just see  just nasty signs  all over the place  it would be awesome  to see  you know something  I might actually  have watched that  just to see  of course  the signs  and laughed my ass off  and shit  but now  why am I going to bother  they're just going to  homogenize the whole thing  human emotions  are just not a good thing  in this particular society  not a good thing  that's not good  you should not  be able to express yourself  in any way  they really are  just trying to 
[01:03:30]  get rid of all that  no anti-LeBron shirts allowed  oh my god  that's it  we don't want to  create  oh my god  we don't want to  create a police state  said  you're creating  a police state  the Cavaliers  Senior Vice President  of Communications  we've always had a real  energetic supercharged  home crowd  and we want to  encourage that  for every game  including December 2nd  we want people  to enjoy themselves  and express themselves  but  see there's got to be  the but  we don't want fans  to cross the boundaries  of decency 
[01:04:00]  we're not going to  allow profanity  and things like that  see that's the thing  right there  we have no tolerance  for anyone trying to  cross those boundaries  see  profanity  and things like that  so that fits  everything into the category  if you just have  fuck LeBron  on your shirt  obviously if you have  a kid there  you're going to be like  ah it's a little  offensive or whatever  but if it's  something clever  I guarantee  they take it away  like years ago  when the Celtics  Lakers rivalry  in Boston 
[01:04:30]  because Nicholson  is such a notorious  Lakers fan  a bunch of Boston  fans showed up  wearing shirts  that said  fuck you Jack  to Nicholson  beautiful  and he loved it  he actually  of course he  because they knew  you know  because he could take it  he actually  I remember  I remember the story  he bought  one of the shirts  from the guys  who was wearing it  wow  he loves the idea  that these fans  seems like him  associated him  with the Lakers  and showed up  with fuck you Jack  so it's like  you know  it's not going to  kill you  to see a dirty word 
[01:05:00]  god  this could have been  a fine sports moment  and they're going to  try to like  fucking protect it  and uh  sterilize it  here's a little  follow up to that  because it's not  about profanity  or anything like that  that's another  fucking cop out  according to the Cavaliers  no anti-Lebron  signs or t-shirts  will be permitted  if one is seen  in the stands  personnel will ask  you to remove it  and offer to replace it  with a Cavaliers  branded replacement  consider it an easy way  to get free Cavs  t-shirts 
[01:05:30]  uh  they  so it's any  anti-Lebron  signs  or  or shirts  how is that  that takes away  that competitive  the spirit of the whole  fucking thing  it really is  you phony motherfuckers  here's why it's phony  this world stinks  because the president  it does right  didn't the head  of the fucking Cavaliers  bash Lebron  for the way he handled it  of course  he bashed it  yeah he's not happy  at all  obviously  maybe he wants  the only shirt  in the place  yeah  so it's like  fuck Lebron  there's a picture  of Lebron 
[01:06:00]  with a bullet in him  picture of his mom  getting fucked in the ass  yeah by three different  players  from different generations  chamberlain  jabbar  fucking  someone from now  they just want  good sportsmanship  all the way around  right  he's gonna  he's gonna  kareem in her face  that doesn't make sense  the word is cream  hold on  this guy's saying  right  Josh in Cleveland  Josh  good evening  hey  the sign thing  is a rumor  you can have signs 
[01:06:30]  I think they just  don't want Lebron  hanging in effigy  that is a  oh stop it  Anthony just read  the statement  I think he was  trying to make  they're sterilizing  the whole situation  up there  I think  you can have  you can have  signs  you can have  shirts  they just  don't want  where's your info  coming from sir  it was all over  the news  this morning  oh was it  was it  Anthony just read  the official statement  from the guy  it was a statement  from the guy  no it's wrong  all right  I'll take it 
[01:07:00]  I'll take line  fucking six  that's who I'll  believe  line six  or something  shut up  god I hate  everything  just makes it  more fun for  everybody  who the fuck  you hurting  in the end  if they  and if they  start fighting  you throw them  out  who are they  going to fight  with  they're going to  fight with  themselves  they all  agree  they took 
[01:07:30]  the Red Sox  shirts away  right  and the Yankee  shirts  like the  bad  like negative  shit  oh yeah  you can't  do that  remember how  much fun  that was  and they got  more and more  creative  every time  those two  teams played  it was like  holy shit  you see the  new one  they just  came up  with  I remember  there was  an article  that came  out where  they started  banning all  that  Yankee  suck  t-shirts  banned  why  at  Fenway  excuse me  don't say  fagway 
[01:08:00]  you might have  to apologize  tomorrow  fagway  fagway  fagway  and  yeah  yeah  they can't  wear those  they can't  wear the  Yankee  suck  shirts  and then  we got  other things  of course  there used  to be a lot  of like  signs in  the stands  a lot  of signs  that people  would hold  up  and now  everything  is offensive  so they  just  take it  away  who's it  offending  in the end  who is it  offending  it offends  people you  would never  want to hang  out with  anyway  all those  good rivalries  that like 
[01:08:30]  people got  creative  and did  things that  just made  you laugh  now it  just gets  thrown out  you're supposed  to sit  there  like a  paying  like an  overpaying  customer  buy their  fucking  wares  buy their  fucking  overpriced  shit  and sit  there like  a victim  and watch  the fucking  overplay  overpaid  shitheads  run around  in circles  or in a  straight line  or bounce  a ball  depending on  what sport  it is  and just  have no  emotion  anymore  why don't 
[01:09:00]  they just  fill the  stadiums  with robots  why not  that's what  they really  want  just sit  there  a bunch  of Fred  Flintstones  we've been  fucking  our balls  have just  been cut  off  year after  year  they just  clip more  of your  nuts off  god  next thing  you know  they're  coming for  your cock  you know  what  I don't  think I'm  going to  watch the  game tonight  yeah  it doesn't  feel exciting  anymore 
[01:09:30]  you're going  to see  like people  boo  I don't  want to  see the  fucking  game  I want to  see the  reaction  of the  fans  and Lebron's  reaction when  he steps  on that  court for  the first  time  they'll  boo  them  but  after that  it's over  how about  booing  and then  you don't  know if  later on  in the game  you're going  to see  somebody  with a  really funny  shirt  or a sign  or some  shit like that  I bet you  they control  the booing  somehow  oh god  they'll  start some  PA music  or something  software  for the  sound  make sure  everybody  sits  no they're  saying  Lou  yes 
[01:10:00]  that's  they'll  bring out  some guy  named Lou  every time  Lebron is  mentioned  so they can  say it's  Lou  they'll have  they're flying  him into  Cleveland  they're just  saying Lou  see Lou's  at the game  he's in the  front  right there  and the camera  real shakily  goes to Lou  every time  they have to  have a  cameraman  right next  to him  at all  can't allow  the emotion  to get out  no god  forbid  real human  emotion  makes its  way out  and is seen  in public  that fucking  book  1984  they're inviting 
[01:10:30]  Lou's  all of it  Lou Diamond  Phillips  is there  Lou Grant  even though it's  not his real  name  just don't sign  the wall  by the toilets  because  Cloris got in  trouble  you're not  even allowed  in unless  your name's  tired of it  but that  book 1984  I read it  every like  four years  I watched  the movie  because I  hate reading  I never  saw the  movie  it's a  little dark  and it's  a little  slow  that fucking  book  predicted all  this shit  yeah  yeah yeah  yeah  with all  the  it's scary 
[01:11:00]  actually  you can't  use real  words anymore  you can't  it's  fucking  amazing  what  what's  happened  and you  know what  we're not  in the  majority  with this  I don't  know how  that happens  we're really  not  our audience  us and our  audience get  it  but we're just  a small piece  man there's a  big fucking  piece of pie  out there  that that  goes along  with this  shit  I was  watching  bullshit  Penn and  Teller's  bullshit  last night  I have  a DVD 
[01:11:30]  from  I don't  know if  it's last  season  but it  was on  taxes  and  god damn  they  they do  a fucking  amazing job  exposing  shit  bullshit  it's just  an amazing  job  perfect name  for the  show  it really  is  well it was  originally called  good stuff  but then they  felt it just  didn't fit  just the way  they talked  about it  I was  getting so  incensed  that I  actually was  thinking like 
[01:12:00]  would it be  possible to  just leave  the country  and then you  realize there's  nowhere else  to go  they got you  wrapped up  where you gonna  go  Mexico  people go  Jesse  people go and  get a citizenship  somewhere else  yeah but  you just  you can't  you're stuck  but then you  realize the  futility of  trying to  change anything  because they're  talking about  the tax law  and the reason  it's so  complicated  and it sounds  like a  conspiracy but  it makes 
[01:12:30]  perfect sense  it's so  complicated  and so  long  because they  really don't  want people  knowing what  they're paying  for or how  they're paying  or if they're  paying more  or less  percentage wise  than their  neighbor  or what  so it keeps  people from  opening their  mouths because  they think  that it could  be worse  so they'll  just keep  quiet because  they think  well that  guy's got  it really  bad  and meanwhile  everyone's  got it bad  except for the  people that  aren't paying  at all  the tax  forms  yeah they're 
[01:13:00]  set up in  a way where  you're paying  way way more  taxes than  you probably  should have  to  yes and  they went  through all  and the  government's  not gonna  send it back  to you go  oh wow  you could have  done this  and this  and save  a few bucks  it's almost  like when you  look at a  contract or a  document that  a lawyer has  made up  it says  things like  here unto  and further  and a party  of the second  party when they  could use your  name but if  you make it  understandable  then you don't  need lawyers  that's why they  don't want a  17% 
[01:13:30]  equal flat tax  because that  removes so much  of the IRS's  necessity  that's why they  cut back on the  size of government  that's why they  created their own  language lawyers  to protect  themselves  so Penn and  Teller are  sitting at a  table and  they have a  big cherry pie  in front of  them and  because I love  when they do  those little  analogies with  visual stuff  so Teller has  a piece of  pie and Penn  goes oh wait 
[01:14:00]  a minute I  don't have any  pie let me  let me get  yours he goes  I'm not taking  yours I'm just  giving myself  some so he  goes I'm not  taking because  they had a  politician actually  describe taxes  as like we're  not penalizing  people that have  made something of  themselves and  are in that  upper tax  bracket we're  not penalizing  them we just  don't want the  poor and  underclass to  be more poor 
[01:14:30]  so we give  them more and  we take more  from the  wealthy as they  call it so  then they showed  it by Teller  sitting there  eating and  trying to eat  his pie and  Penn just  gobbles it  down while  Teller slowly  slicing another  piece because  Penn took his  piece and  he goes wait  I'm all out of  pie again he  goes but I'm  not taking  yours I'm just  giving myself  some mine and  he did it for  the whole pie and  now he goes now  we're both out of  pie he goes so 
[01:15:00]  what we have to  do is we both  have to find  someone with  pie so we  could give  ourselves more  pie and it  was a perfect  example of what's  going on  that doesn't  make sense  though because  this is about  money oh see  it's a it's an  example chip  but it was it  was infuriating to  watch where I  was actually getting  like tense like  like like I was  getting tense and  like I wanted to  I wanted to do  something and then 
[01:15:30]  just realize the  futility of of  change and and  and it'll it will  always be this  way we will  always get just  fucked in the  ass then they  said no you  know obviously no  taxation without  representation so  they sent someone  there to the  representatives right  there at the  Capitol they had a  camera crew and a  gentleman dressed  very nicely trying to  ask questions of their  representatives and  they run the  representatives run  away from you  Charlie cocksucker 
[01:16:00]  fuck wrangle who  is a part of the  ways and means  committee who wrote  the tax law who is  now trying to beg for  leniency because of  tax evasion the  motherfucker wrote the  tax laws and didn't  pay his taxes that  fuck and now he's he's  he's trying to get his  constituents and the  other people on Capitol  Hill he's trying to get  them to um not to 
[01:16:30]  to just give him a  little spanking  shouldn't that  reprimand is not a  censure shouldn't he  go to jail he should  be in jail like  everyone else would be  if they didn't pay  attention to the rules  you wrote you wrote  the fucking things  Wesley Snipes just  get ordered Wesley  Snipes is going to  jail for taxes and  then fucking Charlie  Rangel is now calling  up his fellow fucking  douchebags and asking  for leniency that he  wants uh he wants to  be reprimanded and not 
[01:17:00]  censured which is the  same thing censured is  just a public like  ew look what you did  how about a fucking  jail sentence yes yes  how about thrown out a  fucking office he's  keeping his job how's  he keeping his job  because they voted him  in because his  constituency that he  runs up there is  exactly like the  assholes that voted the  crackhead back in a  fucking D.C. it's all  race but fucking it's  all racial with  Rangel believe me if 
[01:17:30]  that was a white  Republican fucking out  on his ass if not in  jail what does this  have to do with LeBron  oh because it's uh the  same thing the country  just like we we have  no power to do  anything anymore no I  know it's just we have  no power to do  anything it's unbelievable  it's it's fucking  infuriating I feel sorry  for the next generation  ah we'll be born into  this shit so they  feel sorry for us 
[01:18:00]  though the one before  us you think that's  how it goes it's called  like the asshole  infinity syndrome it's  like you always think  that the next one sucks  right and yours is good  it's like they've been  they've been doing this  in 1810 they were  saying yeah well the  1820s come we're done  yeah it'll be fine I  guess you're right we  don't know what it was  like before us it's  always it had to be  better because don't  forget the ones right  after us like the  generation Y or  whatever they're cunts  like the ones that we  I think we're  generation X whatever  whatever it is the  ones like right we 
[01:18:30]  think they suck and  they think the next  one suck it's just the  way it is you know  what you know what  else one more quick  thing that they said  last night someone  said try to call up  your representative and  get 10 minutes with  them that's  representation try to  actually call up your  representative and say  I want to come down to  your office and chat  with you about taxes  do you honestly think  you're going to be able  to face-to-face meet 
[01:19:00]  with your representative  and and talk to him  we're being taxed without  representation they were  running away from tax  questions Nancy fuck  Pelosi was running  literally running away  with bodyguards around  her is that how this was  supposed to be I'm sure  is that the way this was  supposed to fucking be  that's how we were  supposed to be represented  by this upper echelon of  fuckheads that get away  with everything that if 
[01:19:30]  we did we'd be fucked of  course but but they get  away with everything and  they won't listen to  anybody they do whatever  they want to do we're not  represented by them  anymore who's agreeing to  90 percent of the shit  they're coming up with  to fuck us over and  then they were talking  about how taxes guide  your life they write the  tax laws to guide your  life like it's good to  be married it's good to  get yourself into debt and  buy a house for the tax 
[01:20:00]  deduction because you'd be  paying a lot of money and  then it's bad to smoke so  let's tax cigarettes and  gasoline and things like  that taxes were never meant  to guide your fucking life  so that these representatives  can make you do or not do  certain things or you will  or won't be penalized for  it they're they're being  your parents but and using  taxes which is just  supposed to get revenue for  the country that's what it's 
[01:20:30]  supposed to do is to pay for  things not to guide your  fucking morality your life the  syntax on booze and  cigarettes uh i'm sure you'll  yeah people they shouldn't  smoke they shouldn't drink  whatever the fuck it is but  it's not the government's  job to penalize you  financially for doing that  shit how about we take the  money that we're fucking  taxing for people and we  just don't get we don't  help bail out that shit  european union how about  that oh yeah yeah that  would be nice too how about  we take that and put it  back into the economy or  just uh you know yeah yeah 
[01:21:00]  we don't we don't give it to  another country this way we  don't have to tax people for  uh their sins it's insane  that the government is is  guiding you through penalizing  you financially or rewarding  you financially on how you  should live as an american  they are guiding you that you  you have to do certain things  to deduct money from your income  uh taxable income so you don't 
[01:21:30]  have to pay them as much where  was that ever what the founding  fathers wanted uh for this  country well don't forget when  they had let's say in the  beginning they really have to  worry because they did kind of  get free labor so there was a  different financial structure  yeah but i i agree with you  what they were getting away from  with uh uh the king in england uh  is so much less than what we're  dealing with now with our own  the founding fathers i think are 
[01:22:00]  very overrated though i really i  really do because i think that  they were the type of people that  we would hate today but when you  talk about syntax like a part of  me agrees with you and a part of  me is like but if somebody chooses  to smoke i don't mind that that's  their life right but when they get  cancer from their chosen action  yeah i have to pay for it well you  shouldn't have to that's just it  too yeah i'll agree with that the  system is flawed yeah that shouldn't  happen at all yeah you should be  able to smoke and it shouldn't  uh affect you yeah that's it fuck 
[01:22:30]  it that i it's it's wrong on both  levels i just don't i just when  that was made it made it made a lot  of sense that the government's job  is not to fucking uh guide your life  through uh penalizing or rewarding  you financially for what you do as an  american it's that's not what it's  all about it's uh it's astounding  what little power we have as the  people which is the government when  we bash the government people forgot  that's supposed to be you the 
[01:23:00]  government is supposed to be a  representation of you and and your  your neighbors and your family and  everything and that whole thing went  down the shitter so fucking long ago  and will never come back you're not  being able to take a massive  revolution again and then some other  thing to be in place of what's there  now because that'll never change  with the system we have in place  now it it can't why do we always  fuck everything up uh because we 
[01:23:30]  start things and and it's it's great  because again and they say fucked up  absolute power corrupts absolutely it  just they they were given too much  power uh our politicians where they  did it became they're not  representing us they're representing  their own interest they're  representing the people that  represent the politicians own  interest so if you have a a company  that um is is making uh widgets in  your uh a district uh and they give 
[01:24:00]  you a contribution um you're going to  treat them better and give them what  they need more so than the rest of the  people that you're supposed to be  representing and then after a while  that snowballs and and before you know  it you're you're not represented as an  american anymore and and for for the  laws that they're passing and what  they're doing us as far as the taxes  go no one's being represented no one  asked for this shit no american  citizen went to their representative  said please fuck me for 40 percent of 
[01:24:30]  my money at least please you please  fuck me in the ass please bury me in  taxes please make me work please from  january 1st right to april right for  you right every day you work january to  april is for the government how about  the retirement age they want to move  it up to 69 people are living longer  now yeah but they don't want to work  their lives how about you want to relax  a little bit when you realize people  are living longer and you could get to a  retirement age of 65 and realize holy 
[01:25:00]  shit it's i could make it to 80 easy i  got 15 years where i don't have to deal  with the horse shit of working but now  they fucked that up they're moving that  up to 69 possibly they have no clue  pelosi this morning i heard a fuck wants  to work till they're 69 i heard a quote  from pelosi on the news this morning she  actually said because they're debating the  bush tax cuts whether they should give  them uh extend them just uh extend them  for a certain class because uh uh congress  loves a nice class war they fucking love it 
[01:25:30]  should they extend it and um she actually  said giving tax cuts to the wealthy which  by the way is big business small businesses  that is what is considered wealthy will  not create jobs but they want to extend  unemployment she goes extending  unemployment uh creates jobs wow i'm  like what wait a minute she's fucking  worthless is that out of touch shithead she  doesn't even realize that uh that's why  you're not going to be speaker of the 
[01:26:00]  fucking house anymore do you realize  the ass kicking the the cunt kicking you  took how bad is it that the republicans  i mean they really were hate i wanted  them out i wanted them out i wanted a  liberal democrat i was so sick and tired  of things the way they were things  changed and two years later that was  close enough the country is disgusted how  bad that's like a chick who's been beaten  by her husband comes over and then two  weeks later you're such a shit boyfriend  she goes i want to go back and get  punched in the face yeah you suck that's 
[01:26:30]  exactly what that's like uh yeah yeah  or maybe it's not like what this no no  no my examples are not always good i'm  just fucking i'm disgusted could you uh  i'm disgusted at a lack of power to do  anything you just get my cock picture  that's yeah nice this is a good one no  and i don't want paylin to run for  president don't fuck this up either keep  her in alaska with a dumb tv show enough  very good at bravo at it people are 
[01:27:00]  saying bravo bravo yeah uh florentine  here all right we'll get florentine in  next and uh iraq could you find out what  imus is talking about today okay no imus  i can't really i got i got this point's a  little higher now too i can't go like  but i haven't oh why were you just got  a i got i got something from a pretty  reliable source but i source i don't i  want to double check this yeah hopefully 
[01:27:30]  we'll have more imus is a friend of  ours all right man we'll be back  sirius xm  yeah jim florentine in studio our pal i was 
[01:28:00]  commenting on uh anthony's rage he has  this morning i was like i was fucking  rolling i love a person with rage that's  why i fucking hang out with norton  because i know how to get i know how to  get him going yeah the buttons yeah  yeah but i just listen you just wish  your rage would get something changed  i know and it never changes it just  that's what i finally realized in my  life i i've ranted and raved for so many  fucking years and finally realized holy  shit it doesn't change it's the futility  of it all that really gets me is the 
[01:28:30]  frustration of not being able to do  anything yeah but i guess it feels good  to get it off your chest i guess but you  really wish because you you feel like  you know more than the average fucking  asshole you would hope that you work  with you know you would just hope and  and and i was i was saying it jim it's  like you know you get these people with  the signs and we're gonna change the tax  structure no tag and you could have a  hundred fucking thousand five hundred  thousand a million people on the  great lawn and they're protesting that  and then they go away with their shirts  and their buttons in it i think 
[01:29:00]  nothing fucking changes nothing does i  mean even obama tried to do it a nice  way i guess look i'm gonna work a  republicans i'm gonna go talk to iran and  north korea and talk and i was like all  right that sounds logical and now he's  already apologized and i should have  worked with the republicans more  and okay that's good in theory to go  talk to iran say hey what's the problem  let's work this shit out but it's not  gonna work that's like some guy going  back to his like his first ex-wife who's  having fucking nightmares for 20 years  ago let me get you guys in a room and  see if we could talk this out in five 
[01:29:30]  minutes dude you were fucking right she's  out of her mind yeah yeah in a nutshell  that's what it is when when obama was  talking change and everything and  obviously i wasn't agreeing with his  his platform but he got elected on on  the this whole change thing and  everyone i think everyone most people  anyway knew you know what nothing  fucking change it's like saying if  you're on a fucking train and and the  track is straight and you go you know  what i'm gonna make a left up here so 
[01:30:00]  no you know you're not yeah you're  fucking not you're on this track you  can't turn the train and that's pretty  much what happens with the with  government and and with us and and it  it goes beyond just the government and  stuff it's it's our whole way of life  we talk about how uh me and obama have  talked many times about how you don't  have freedom they said i love it america  you know we have freedom and it's like  you don't have freedom to do shit you  can't fucking i can't just go hunting if  i wanted to it's like you know what i 
[01:30:30]  want to i want to feed my family i'm  gonna grab a rifle i'm gonna hit the  woods i'm just gonna bag a deer and  fucking drag them home because we got  free because we're free to do oh what i  can't do that all right you know what  though i'm gonna drive up to oh i'm not  free to do that at least can i walk down  the street with a beer in my hand no i  can't do that to do that you're not  free to do fucking anything at least  you own your own house no you don't what  you can't do anything that's another  thing i saw in pen and tell his  bullshit which was amazing lawns they  did all show on lawns and how people 
[01:31:00]  sign on to these neighborhoods where  and they did sign on so you're kind of  fucked and that's how they fuck you  where you have to keep your lawn  manicured or you can go to jail for not  having your lawn manicured and the same  type of grass as your neighbor and uh  people have gone to jail for not having  their lawn for having brown spots on  their lawn what kind of freedom is that  uh you you don't have any freedom i  wanted to you know when i initially  wanted to put my pool in i bought my  fucking house i have my land my 
[01:31:30]  property i am the property master i  wanted to dig a hole line it with  cement and fill it with fucking water  the hoops the variances from town that  i had to get the fences that i had to  get variances for the inspectors that  come in the money that fucking just  comes out of your pocket that you don't  even know where it's going to officials  for the freedom that i get to live on  my own land like paw angles but in their  defense they probably knew what parties  you were throwing they said put up a 
[01:32:00]  big fence exactly and a camera yeah and  get fucking chris hansen over there  half his sap half his guests might walk  into the water like luke costello's kid  it's just it's when you're when you step  back for a few seconds and a lot of  people don't you you are caught up in  this almost uh matrixy feeling thing  sometimes that you you don't step back  and look at the big picture and go like  wow we are really fucked as this we we 
[01:32:30]  have this image of america and americans  and then there's the reality of it which  really isn't um what you think it is  you think they have more freedom in iraq  uh well with the uh in general in general  anarchy brings more freedom but it's not  necessarily i guarantee better way of  life i guarantee if you're looking to  have some kind of property that you own  you could do just what you just said  take a make your own hole with cement  and get a hose filled with bodies  whatever you want to do yeah you know i 
[01:33:00]  was just over in kuwait i was performing  for the troops over there i was talking  to a kuwait god bless you they but those  guys they actually like us because we  saved their ass so they don't really  hate america maybe they do they talk  behind our back like they are very slow  when you go through customs aren't  they the fuck but did they get you  through quickly yeah because they had  some some representative meet me there  and just hot chick in kuwaiti and the  fuck yeah some asian broad and every  kuwaiti was even checking her out and  then that's opposed to i guess or  whatever and she i went right through  and got right through probably but  their government she got you through  their government though um they give 
[01:33:30]  anyone that's a poor a national they  give them at least six grand a month  just to stay there to stay in the  country because they don't want  everybody leave and that's the minimum  that's like the low the white trash low  shit from six thousand to fifteen  thousand a month they give every  family they just stay away they only  work six six hour days seven a.m. to  one p.m. four days a week how does  their country work oil oil that's it  have oil and that's a great incentive  to stay there the government gives you  money every month and you work six  hour days but then again it does show  you what happens when the military has 
[01:34:00]  a fucking to be called up they  basically just open their mouths and  allow the iraqis to stick that they  really were not a good yeah they were  not used to defending things that's  true we do have like like the women  have no rights over there which is  great  they just gotta shut their mouth shut  you like that yeah  this country is you know they always 
[01:34:30]  talk about it it's richness and  resources and everything but then you  look and we don't make anything or  or really like we should be such a  wealthy country just as wealthy if not  more than these oil producing  countries like yeah we have some oil  i think we we pretty much use it for  ourselves we export a little bit of it  but we have like a fuckload of  resources how do we not have the  world's money pouring into this  country instead of it being the other 
[01:35:00]  way around like that i can't  understand but it's an amazing  country and it went and it's just been  so fucked over and bastardized and  fucking raped that we can't even  fucking get the world to buy our shit  anymore i and i don't know what it is  i'm not smart enough or educated enough  to even know what the fuck why this is  happening is it unions is it fucking  assholes is it welfare state is it a  combination everything taxes i don't  know what it is but it sucks it's 
[01:35:30]  every and even like when you died a  death tax is like over 50 percent so  your family's fucking mourning they  lost you and they take half of your  money then what is that what is it  death tax well the estate tax is  uh expiring or the uh the lack thereof  now you're fine if you die from now  until january 1st or december 31st at  midnight uh you're okay you don't get  taxed so that's what we should do then  yeah drop dead yeah uh believe me the  steinburner family must have been  ecstatic right he fucking died i'm not  kidding yeah they said they died after 
[01:36:00]  january 1st it was a whole different  story shit half of the steinbrenner  fortune goes to the united states  fucking that couldn't be right it is  no it is it is there's a 50 percent  estate tax so you die after fucking  january 1st half your shit goes to the  government and then the other half goes  to your family and stuff you can set up  some tax-exempt stuff and uh um trusts  to work around you can work around it  yeah um i like i work with my finance  guy you know like a bet but work with 
[01:36:30]  barry and shit like that to get things  done uh just to try to protect not even  to make i'm not sitting there with a  cigar going hey make me money my i need  my jewish guy to come in and make me some  more bags of money it's just trying to  hold on to your shit now accounts used to  be there to like you want to invest in  this to a great return it's a tax-free  until you retire it's this it's that  now it's all about how could i keep my  shit yeah i just want to hold on to a 
[01:37:00]  little bit that they let me have it is  fucking amazing it's astounding and  fucking infuriating they won't even  release your money like the courts won't  even like if there's a bunch of money  like a house or something like that when  someone dies like a four hundred thousand  dollar house yeah they put in that the  government gets it before it even gets in  your hands they get it fucking and now  you got a fucking you know the legal  fees that you have to pay just to fight  to get the shit that should be yours  that you're entitled to oh i leave you 
[01:37:30]  my fortune where it's not get the  suitcase not and that's why i respect  joe de maggio used to keep his money in  a fucking green hefty bag good for him  when the san francisco earthquake he was  running down the street with a hefty bag  worth like with five hundred thousand  dollars in it is that true yeah oh yeah  what a great story yeah he was just  keeping it because he didn't trust  banks or anything like that he just  had all this cash that he made from  cards he started selling car you know  signing cards and stuff like that  after all those years that's fucking 
[01:38:00]  kept it in a hefty bag he was running  down the street or if anyone asked  what was in the bank he'd divert their  attention by sticking his finger under  the nose smell maryland this is her  molar when i punched it out he's a  little nick of his fucking knuckle oh  that wasn't from sandy koufax  that was in maryland she commented on a  nice jfk's hair look at the  inauguration  so i fucking knocked her molar out  you see you see that cunt sing happy  birthday she lost two on that one too 
[01:38:30]  and fucking popped out one of her  uppers and one of her lowers is he a  bad boy like that joey joey d oh yeah  apparently he used to uh legendary he  used to give maryland uh i know he did  stuff with the baseball the old uh yeah  he used to give her the old carlo yeah  so there you go we're but we're free  we're it's but we're doing we're doing  well in this country go see how free  you are go pick something you want to  do and then just do it aside from you  know taking transportation going to work 
[01:39:00]  and doing everything you're supposed to  do try going off the beaten path for one  fucking second and doing something you  really just kind of want to do and see  what it takes to actually do that and  stay within the boundaries of your freedoms  right dude i'm looking i'm looking at  the uh the tax thing on tentative tax  uh lower limit upper limit i guess  they say further taxation if you make if  it's three million or more 55 percent  of the excess is over three million  fucking those scumbags and then take 
[01:39:30]  the money that they leave you and  invest it now there's capital gains tax  on that and there's sales tax on  everything you buy and then like you  said when you die after everything's  said and done that'll get half of it  anyway so they don't give a shit i'm  trying to sell a place of mine it's  like i'm trying to sell for like five  grand of what i bought it from two in  2002 my brother's like look at least  you want to pay any capital gains tax so  look at it that way yeah yeah i guess  you're right yeah that's the frame of  mind we're all in right now that's cool  it isn't even making money it's like at  least i won't have to and then insert 
[01:40:00]  how you're getting fucked here you pay  taxes when you buy a place you pay the  i think the buyer pays the taxes yeah  and the seller does not pay the taxes  but you pay the capital gain right  anything you make on it you make on  it's capital gains right and and if you  if you start turning over houses  quickly like that's your business  capital gains are higher depending on  how long you own something like stocks  if you're just trading stocks back and  forth and making money because you know  you're fucking making money you got  pay huge capital gains tax if you're a 
[01:40:30]  long-term holder you don't have to pay  as much but they just figured out a way  to fuck you oh wait by the way  additionally estates of descendants that  to die after december 31st will be  subject to a five percent surcharge on  the excesses of their estate over 10  million so anything over 10 is an extra  five is that what we're represented is  that what the people wanted is that what  the represented public went to the  representatives and said this is what i 
[01:41:00]  want i want you to take half my shit  when i die where did that come from  with how is that a representative  government would you would you be okay  with that if you knew the country  would drastically get better no i would  figure out another way cut fucking  government but that on top of that  though you know nothing changes nothing  will change all your fucking you'll  still fucking ram your goddamn rim into  a pothole you'll still fucking have to  pay your stupid taxes on on everything  you buy nothing would change because  there's other places that money goes 
[01:41:30]  it's all the cronyism that goes on and  the fucking pork barrel shit from these  politicians and the pet projects that  go billions over budget with no  accountability look at your big dig  boston take a good look at that holy  fuck we used to hear from truckers that  would park trucks running and just burn  gas but with like huge boulders in the  back pocket money it was amazing the 
[01:42:00]  the waste that goes on that project was a  couple million i guess oh yeah yeah i  think it went ten dollars and fifty cents  over budget uh oh just just a fucking  infuriating mess that will never end so  you just go home and drink and with that  we say hi to jim florentine that's how  florentine's appearance starts uncle 
[01:42:30]  vinnie's uh jimmy december 10th friday  december 10th point pleasant new jersey  and then uh that metal show um every  saturday 11 o'clock this week laugh to  take your mind off of it all metal that's  what the government does any ddl yeah i'm  having a metal show you went to ozzy with  a little jimmy norton last night right  yeah speaking of which the garden on  merchandise oh christ 60 40 split with 
[01:43:00]  that's the union now now of course you're  giving 60 a t-shirt an ozzy t-shirt was  35 dollars for a short sleeve yeah and it  was 90 for a hoodie 90 dollars because me  and jim did the beacon years ago with dice  and it's the same split i remember 60 40  merch split and that's the tax plus the  eleven point two five tax you put on a  haven't did i try to make a deal how  about we go 50 50 but they actually  decided they should get more money from  your merchandise than you no no we get 
[01:43:30]  almost half there's no reason for those  fucking dirtbags almost half no reason  scared me i thought they actually went  past the half i said no i deserve more  than you i wouldn't even put that i know  thank you i am out of my mind about the  merch split and pete will usually go  because it annoys me i don't make that  much on merch it's it's not believe  usually it will cover how is that  justified because they just think that  you're in their house guys like jimmy  buffett for their house guys like jimmy  buffett it's your material it's your 
[01:44:00]  stuff so why should they get a cut of  them in right and they're not giving  you a cut of their fucking liquor i  believe me i am a nasty motherfucker  club i'm not getting a cut of your  fucking drinks if there was a full  madison square garden of people going  i wonder who's going to be here  tonight but i just came here because i  love coming to the madison square  garden i could understand them taking  that cut right but they're coming there  to fucking see you you know they're  coming there to see whoever's there  aussie uh well aussie i mean the  overall you you know it's like they're 
[01:44:30]  coming to see the performer it's the  performer brought the people in it's  more so what's the balls of them saying  like well it's our place yeah but  they're fucking people and they will  get it to 50 50 you know that in some  place they will get it to 50 50 unless  you're buffett a guy like that and this  is what i've heard how did buffett get  around because buffett sells 60 000  seats a night he sells out he sells out  arena sports arenas so you think like  bruce has the same kind of deal i'm  sure if bruce is smart he does it  probably means these guys probably get 
[01:45:00]  100 percent of their merch i believe  they get a piece of the liquor and a  piece of parking are you kidding me  these guys uh when you when you bring  in that kind of business you can say  okay go fuck yourself fuck the unions  i'll go across the street and i'll work  at that 50 000 seat like they make so  much money we need that agent for the  fucking we need that kind of draw power  too like when you draw like buffett  does dumb joke you can you can you can  uh you can put your own rules because  he doesn't need to work giant stadium he 
[01:45:30]  doesn't need to work there he can work  uh any other already he can go to philly  yeah and the people are still gonna  come to that and see him i would have  seen him rappers idolize him because  the way he fucking does business business  so ozzy was great there was great man  didn't uh norton tell you about the  birthday gifts that are still he did  those are them right there you got it  you got it you got it uh he said there  was video of it you know that he left  but i said you know it'd be great to end  that video is jim returning the stuff 
[01:46:00]  yeah yeah lift it up lift him up feel  the entire stack he was he expected  ozzy one of his guys to walk out with  18 pounds of books 18 pounds of gifts  those books are legendary now though  those are the famous this is the one he  had the big one i'm showing jim the  one yeah but he liked the other ones he  didn't have oh he's a 10 year old he  liked them so much he left them yeah i  really just i'm delusional aren't i if i  would have just got this one ron palford  gave me a bunch of his t-shirts from  his clothing line when he did our show 
[01:46:30]  yeah and you know what i didn't leave  him because i liked them yeah see there  you go if you would have given him  talk about this yeah he would have  taken it briefly he would have  personally picked it up and taken it if  you would have given him that one book  i know the one the one 365 days like  like jimmy always does the over  generous boy that you are you just got  him too many things i got very i got  very carried away you did too much  goodness for you when i met ozzy when i  was like a kid like 17 years old he was  doing some record store in new york city  you must have been a real dick  i was like i'm like ozzy can you sign 
[01:47:00]  he's like yeah he signed i go here here's  my watch it was like an eight dollar  watch he's like what do i want your  watch for i'm like i don't know i just  have i'm a big fan he's like i appreciate  it but i don't want your watch no  seriously take it what the fuck am i  going to do with your watch we're  arguing over he's like i'm not taking  your watch and then security's like just  go go what is he going to do with my  eight dollar watch so would have just  left it there i know someone at  wherever the signing was would have been  wearing your watch imagine him coming

[01:54:30]  it  dude i don't blame them a bit actually  wait do we have that no we don't  that was lost at the ledge one do we  have that last time jimmy introed ozzy  uh no oh we don't have that no we  don't think god you did a great job at  the tribute out not l.a to the tribute  yeah the tribute itself was one thing but  the really uh we don't  are you ready  like he takes his headphones off  come on you motherfuckers you're sitting at  barry manilow concert are you ready  let me hear you make some noise 
[01:55:00]  jimmy hates this  jimmy actually he rips his headphones off  and covers his ears as hard as he can  and does his shivo impression  yeah it makes noise so he can't hear it  you know it wasn't that bad because  that's what you have to do at a show  the barry manilow thing  yeah it's like all right  what did he do last night jose feliciano  oh shit  this ain't a jose feliciano concert 
[01:55:30]  oh was i just a cunt  i'm a real cunt  i'm taking myself off the ac show  to put somebody cooler on  no  no but when you're up there in front of  those animals you know that you gotta be  a cheerleader i just did that whole tour  with slayer and megadeth for a month  oh do you want a nightmare gig jimmy  you told some of the stories  yeah  you got any other stories from that  and i realized that i because i always  hated the cheerleader i'm like you have  to do that half the time sneak  sneak in a quick joke then go back to  cheerleading sneak in another one before  to even realize hey is this guy  fucking doing comedy up here i don't 
[01:56:00]  want to hear this there are rules to  going out and bringing on bands we went  in philly we did a couple and stuff  you have to touch anything no no i  don't mean rules like that i mean rules  that you have to follow to get a good  reaction not tank you got to mention  the city that'll get a fucking cheer  you got a curse that'll get a  fucking cheer and then you mention  the band and then that gets a cheer  and you fucking leave or you give it  up for the opening band god smack or  whatever it is you know like that get  one more time for god smack come on 
[01:56:30]  they kicked ass up here boom you know  nice applause there the band don't try  to fucking do anything oh my god  remember the time jimmy with um  well i must confess it was me that was  the monkey all right i bombed i was  that was a kid rock in philly uh kid  rock show we we were doing stuff for  tickets and one guy actually took a a  freeze-dried monkey um dead monkey and  stuck his dick in its mouth and we're  like that's good for tickets you know 
[01:57:00]  yeah it's one of those come on down to  the studio and do something crazy uh and  um jimmy got on stage was like you  know you heard the monkey thing and  people can you know a lot of people  have heard it yeah he goes well i must  confess that was me no i said it was  something like that might as well have  been i said that i must confess it was  just me in a monkey mask yes yes  implied that i was blowing the guy not a  good one what happened what what was  the response is what happened  the applause were it wasn't good i must 
[01:57:30]  confess so i jumped in and went how we  doing motherfuckers i got it right and i  was there too like yay we were doing good  after that joke motherfucker yay say  motherfucker and shit yeah let's hear it  philly we're philly we're in philly yeah  they'll cheer i like see that's why i go  wrong though like when i'm at like sports  events i'll go you know rivalry is  important but sportsmanship is more 
[01:58:00]  important  yeah sportsmanship yeah  doesn't quite we're going to rock out  tonight but let's remember to be  courteous to those around us  the bottle hits your head as it should  thrown by ozzy  oh my a fucking i'm just not a i i it's  like i'm i'm an eager little fruit i  can't be cool rock guy i'm eager fruit  well you know because he's not a rah 
[01:58:30]  rah guy yeah he's not because his stand  up's not about like hey give it up for  the ladies you know come on ladies you're  smarter than men he's never been that  not even in darfur would i say that  he's not one of those guys he's so he's  never been he's not a fucking right he's  just a fucking miserable angry guy and  you don't want that as like especially  like warming up uh shows like the daily  show or you know i tried doing that i  got fired up like three i'm not one of  those guys either but it's just not some  of the guys are fucking cheerleaders out 
[01:59:00]  there they work perfect with that by the  way this is why i love florentine so  much because he's really good the cock  balls that but who doesn't love that  about his balls are just heavy the cock is  really not what i would want but it's a  he just knows how to make you feel  better like you know i mean because  i'm such a zilch but he knows how to  take my zilchdom he could take me from a  zero to a four which is believe me a big  jump but i love bringing him right back  to a zero i love that yeah do you think  they're gonna like you no they're not  you kids have a good time there yeah we 
[01:59:30]  really do man it's uh we have a fucking  his roast was fucking hilarious i always  tell i was tell back to the slayer tour  real quick i was telling jim um my man my  agent pete that's uh jim's agent too you  know i did this whole tour for a month  he goes look man bring merchandise out  there you'll sell a ton you do a meet and  greet after the show he goes at the big  table and you'll sell a fucking fortune  of merchandise i said my this would be  great so i'll bring all my t-shirts i got  these t-shirts my name on it with some 
[02:00:00]  skulls little thing or whatever so i go  all right i'll sell them for 20 bucks at  the merch table i'll fucking sell a fortune i'll  plug it on stage what happened was the  headliner in these contracts whoever the  headliner is selling their t-shirt for any  opening acts can't sell for lower so  slayer has t-shirts for 35 dollars so  megadeth and anthrax can't sell theirs  cheaper so everybody's got to be 35 now  slayer's got fucking 20 shirts of like  classic album covers for 35 megadeth's got  like 15 with mustang on it with the  fucking hair anthrax got like 10 and i 
[02:00:30]  had one one with jim florentine with  like four skulls in the corner okay i did  the math there was 87 000 people i performed  in front of over like 16 shows i sold  three three t-shirts i bought a fucking  suitcase that weighed like 90 pounds on me i  had to pay extra at fucking baggage for it  i loved it around the country three three  that's 105 dollars uh and they took a cut and 
[02:01:00]  they took that and they took that cut  wow that is bad but they didn't have cds so  i sold a lot of cds because i could sell  them wherever i wanted but yeah three t-shirts  i was even again i was telling my sister we're  gonna have to ship more out probably have  to ship them here i'm thinking about all  nothing  that makes no sense for someone like you  know you're a comic you're not a band and  if somebody wants a megadeth shirt they're  gonna pay 35 even if you're selling yours  for 20 then i can go oh i just want the  cheapest shirt here yeah i don't know 
[02:01:30]  some logic around that i don't know what  it is but yeah but you don't think people  your shirt was in high demand it it was  the worst shirt up there by far and just  one nobody cared you didn't have the  selection it was always it was just in  the corner by itself  it was a bad story  that's sad we got a guy in the music  business saying your jimmy buffett thing  is a little wrong  oh okay i want to i'm curious wayne in  texas what do you know  warren buffett he's amazing 
[02:02:00]  yes that was jimmy cliff the uh reggae  singer oh sorry  wayne  yo  hey wayne  yeah jimmy does uh does it a little  different he um he has his own  production company so he'll go in and  say he wants to tour 25 shows  well he'll bid the entire 25 shows for  120 million dollars and then his  production company comes in there and  they price out the production uh their 
[02:02:30]  merch split is a 90 10 and that 10  percent is for the administration and  the taxes on it but he's paid up front  120 million bucks whether they sell one  ticket  wow but he gets a piece of the parking  and the liquor too  no he doesn't  that's not what i've heard  no  now like jimmy jimmy's in the know on  this one there wayne i could be wrong  wayne may be right but i i just say i  you're right about the t-shirts 90 10 is 
[02:03:00]  just about a hundred percent  no but i mean if it's for tax reasons um  yeah that sounds more like a financial  what they do is their people will sell  so you count it in you count it out so  they have an accurate number of what's  sold and they take their 10 for tax  purpose for the state tax so state tax is  one thing that doesn't i don't count state  tax as a merch split honestly because  that's you have there are places now when  you get paid at gigs and they used to  never do this but they actually take out  state tax which makes me very angry but 
[02:03:30]  you will get it back  most of the big big big tours like  aussie's tour u2 uh fleetwood mac a  couple years back are all aeg live now  so they just bid the contracts and like  aussie probably um went into madison  and said i want to rent madison square  god and they said all right you can have  it for a million dollars a night and  i'll take the number of seats in madison  square the cost of production the cost  of staffing and they divide it into the 
[02:04:00]  seats and say okay that ticket needs to  be right five dollars and they work on a  ninety percent sold out ratio at ninety  percent everybody starts making money so  they get it on the back end right so i  think he's actually uh obviously you know  what you're talking about because we  were talking uh when jim and i sat down  one of the guys who works the garden we  were asking about the curfew because the  union fees for curfews are terrible and um  the guy sitting about well the production 
[02:04:30]  company is doing it we're not paying  them so the curfews aren't the same  um so this guy's obviously right although  i do think that maybe there's something  about uh uh i i can't say where i know it  from but the person i've heard it from is a  very very reliable source now sometimes and  i don't it probably depends in different  states but if they if there is a liquor  control you can just like much you can  count the amount of bottle of liquors in  and then you have to count it out at the 
[02:05:00]  end of the night and that's a contracted  you know cut after after that ninety  percent it's all all kind of on the back  end unions kill your deal because if you  go over or late or you have to take five  hours to load out that union clock never  stops right so it's they're always cutting  cutting rigors and cutting sound production  guys to cut oh that back end cost down to  make more money what's what's the um  oz fest oz fest this year oh sorry oz fest 
[02:05:30]  last year was bid out at seventy million  dollars the entire festival and then bands  that joined to play had to pay to play on  oz fest right so you know do you have a ton of  money do you work for uh do you work  because obviously you i could look if i'm  wrong i'll do my homework if i uh am wrong i'm  wrong because obviously you know what you're  talking about do you work for uh let's just say a  production company because you what kind of 
[02:06:00]  work do you do because you certainly know  all right hello wayne we didn't hang up that's  obviously a district call back wayne if you hear  this he's dead maybe he's like i gotta go i gotta go i don't want to talk i i want to  know i want to know what the fines are trying to call him out i i think he's  obviously knows he knows what he's doing i want to know what the fines are once  they go over curfew because i've heard like five thousand dollars a minute or  ten thousand dollars for the first five minutes if you go over it that's at  venues like pnc garden and anything like that on the stopwatch 
[02:06:30]  oh they are oh yeah fuck yeah dude tony dennis who's ozzy's assistant ran out  because ozzy was going long ran out and at one point he whispered to him  and then um right ozzy did the next to the last song and right before he did the  final encore tony ran out again and spoke to him and ozzy went okay and he  put his hand out and boom they went right into the song  whereas normally ozzy would build that final song a little bit he built it cuts  into the profits yeah but he literally i i think tony probably said you got it 
[02:07:00]  you got four minutes let's go you got tony probably told damn now you're in a  time crunch and he literally just uh you didn't lose out because he did the  song the same sure right yeah but just like the build-up to it he kind of  this is how much time you have and then you start losing thousands of dollars  you want to get that out of the way that sharon gets that bill yeah she's not  gonna be happy what the fuck were you doing would you i would really not want her  hollering around the stage when are you losing money ozzy yes i never get um 
[02:07:30]  there was i think it was a k-rock event like eight years ago at pnc one of those  whatever fucking things they have with all the bands on it and limp biscuit was  big at the time and they were supposed to go on like six o'clock when it was  still light out and fred durst was pulling some shit that he didn't want to  go on in during a day but meanwhile they had creed ozzy stone temple pilots  after so i mean he had some big bands after so he said he was stuck in traffic so  everybody had to wait and sharon was running the whole thing he they got there  they went on late and he just and he wouldn't get off the stage and sharon 
[02:08:00]  fucking unplugged the electricity on the stage and shut down everything  because he was going over on his time story yeah i was at that show  the fucking mic just went out and fucking fred just whipped it down oh you saw it live  oh yeah i was at that show was i with you dude because i was at odds fest  no it was like one of k-rock shows or something like that wayne's back wayne  yo hey buddy uh jimmy what were you asking him when his phone knocked out  because you obviously know are you uh in production or i mean i want to say who  you work for but what kind of work do you do  um i own a production company and i work for a management company 
[02:08:30]  wait what is the uh this is what we wanted to know too what is the fine  for because i was did you hear me just saying how tony ran out to talk to ozzy  while he was on stage no oh because as ozzy it was like 11 15 it was getting late  and uh tony dennis who's ozzy's the only guy that can be on stage besides the band  who like run out and put his water ran out and whispered to him a couple of times  in between songs and ozzy you could see wanted to wrap up what would the fines be if you 
[02:09:00]  went over curfew well it's not really a fine it's just a an additional cost you know madison  square like nokia there and new york city's fucked for the for the entertainer because it's all  union control from the time you fucking get there to the time you load in they've got to have a  shake down break and there's gotta be they can't if it takes four guys to fucking load in shit you  need 10 for the union so everything is you know it's a profit loss it's a profit loss so they they 
[02:09:30]  have to be cut and done by let's say 11 11 p.m if ozzy decides he wants to sing an extra song god  bless his soul and and he does and they they go they don't clock out to 11 15 well that's another  hour per employee per union so you know i see okay i just got a text that said if if someone goes over  a minute you might as well do the whole hour so it's a whole hour to get charged for yeah if it's 
[02:10:00]  1101 it's one hour jesus christ and for 10 guys that do the job before i know no wonder we're  fucked you know exactly and i do i think unions are really important but this is where i hate them  because like because kenny a lot of times in certain venues he'll run out to set the stool  or put something on the stage but they have a guy that does that he should talk no i do that as soon  as i walk up but they won't let kenny do it production for ozzy is is huge so you've got to have a  certain amount of electricians you've got to have a certain amount of breakers you've got to have 
[02:10:30]  lighting guys and they're all got to be and don't worry hello he's gone again yeah wayne's  wayne keeps cutting out i just unions keep cutting them off you don't want to go over yeah i just got  a uh text from my agent who uh works with a lot of bands and you know he knows all the money these  guys make and he said that you go over by five minutes you pay expenses for full hour so maybe it's  five so they give you like a little i don't know maybe maybe maybe peace is using common speak 
[02:11:00]  and say you're about five minutes you lose the whole hour the employees stay till midnight if  they go to 1106 you know what i mean no they're gone at fucking 11 10 so they get paid for the  rest of the fucking hour they'll take the money yeah i disagree we would all take that deal though  jim i mean who are you kidding you're the guy that stays because they paid you absolutely  i would unplug the electricity like an airplane just to prolong the show  i'm staying because i'm a good employee yes fuck i wish sharon was i would love to ask her about  that she'll talk about of course she will she's fucking brutal she i would love to hear her talk 
[02:11:30]  about that oh yeah ask if you ever ask her about that wanker oh would she fucking she really  she wouldn't mince words one more uh try with wayne uh wayne your phone sucks yes wayne do you have  an iphone yeah i'm on a i'm on a tour bus going from michigan to ohio so hey uh who are you doing  today or yeah what yeah you can find what band i've got a little punk rock band called forever  the sickest kids we're doing a little christmas pageant oh okay right on this pageant well thanks

[02:13:00]  and of course the metal show with our pal eddie trunk yes uh jimflorentine.com i got merchandise  all that shit for christmas all that vegas dates this is the opian anthony show  jamie hector will be in studio soon we got jim florentine in studio  florentine's a father now we're both fathers oh hey father my kid's almost seven months your kid's 
[02:13:30]  about four a little over three a little over three liking it yeah it's uh it's a challenge isn't it  oh is he crawling yet no he's not crawling yet but just uh just uh he becomes mobile mobile  mobile locomotion then your life's over so it's it's this is the easy part when they're just laying  easy part can you still put him in the middle of a bed and let him just sleep yeah oh yeah yeah  yeah i remember those days then it gets to a point where he just wants to catapult over the 
[02:14:00]  side of the bed at every moment see everyone says it gets easier you know in the beginning it's a  little tough with the sleeping and i'm getting up all the time but it gets easier but i don't see  that happening because when the kid can crawl and walk you got to watch every move and then he wants  to explore everything and and that means trying to find everything in the house that could kill him  your job is to keep him alive you do know that right that's that's your job if you if you like  keep take your eye off him for five minutes he could kill himself that's the job of a parent 
[02:14:30]  great no joke yeah you just well you just gotta take all the shit out of her room just complete  bare room that would put pillows around the wall and let him fucking fall on the carpet i turned my  back and within a minute he was chewing on wires that were plugged in i'm like why the wires  there's everything else in this place can't you can't you explore the the the soft pillow  that was one of the worst worst fucking things about going over my brother's house uh the baby 
[02:15:00]  after the baby was born he's like yeah i used to go to my brother's house there's just fucking  tars laying around and like bottles of beer and shit like that and then i go over after the kid's  born and he's got those puzzle piece like foam mat that goes all over the entire floor i got that  wood floor i got it yeah he's he had that whole thing and then other stuff like he's got this  little fucking jumpy thing with the net around it i'm like what is this shit there's a lock on 
[02:15:30]  everything you can't even drop a deuce you know why they do that now because the kid decides to  pull himself up and drown himself in the turlet yes your job is to just keep him alive my parents  my mom raised a seven of us stayed home there was like every year there was another kid born how  the fuck did she do it i never fell in the toilet i didn't fall in the toilet i didn't wear a seatbelt  the fucking windows were open and you're both shitty guys  but we talked about the electric 
[02:16:00]  they got covers on the electric outlets now  you remember as a kid one of the brothers would electrocute themselves  and you learn not to do that anymore kids today they don't get that uh opportunity to learn  i stuck tweezers yeah i stuck tweezers in the uh socket forks and all sorts of shit but i was  holding like the end of it i guess so it shorted out before it got to my my hand so i didn't get  shocked but it scared the piss out of me put a big mark on the wall and the lights went out and i 
[02:16:30]  think i my dad probably fucking just jabbed me with the tweezers a few times and uh never again  did i fucking put anything in the socket my friend had this built-in pool and we used to stick our  dicks in the suction hole in the shallow end and we would take turns just hugging it and just  i don't even know what the fuck was on the other end  dude gonna cut our dicks off and we just sit there for like 10 minutes come on it's my turn  all right one more second i gotta know did it feel good it felt unbelievable  right now that pool is in therapy 
[02:17:00]  so you're just at the uh sleep eat shit stage right yeah not moving really yet no oh you're so lucky  you get excited when it starts rolling over but that's the end because then it starts to  you know move all over the place trying to kill itself you tie it down huh not just tie it down  the right way that's the way a kid should be raised tie him to bed till they're 18 just feed  them can you still change diapers without a problem yeah oh it's a two-man job now for us 
[02:17:30]  a major two why what is it union yeah it's a union job every drop of piss that escapes to a thousand  extra dollars our kids aren't that far apart and you don't know this yet it's going to be a problem  for some reason he doesn't want his diaper changed oh twisting and turning and trying to jump off the  the changing table well you got to say to him look this is counteractive to what i'm trying to do  you have to explain what counter production is yes i don't understand i don't appreciate you're 
[02:18:00]  making this more difficult than it need be that's the way you talk to kids i i got in trouble yesterday  when i was babysitting the kid and i kind of scared him because it was kind of i didn't realize how  how it could affect them i guess but there's this toy and if you spin it real fast it gets all excited  and i think the reaction is hilarious and my wife had to point out to me no that's not hilarious  he's scared shitless but he can't run away yet so he's making the movements of running but he can't 
[02:18:30]  do it yet what the fuck are you doing so i had to stop that i didn't know you learned you'll he won't  remember that he's too young yeah they say they don't even remember yeah yeah the first six months  yeah nothing happens that you can remember your entire personality is formed by the time you're two  believe me he'll be 18 running from something that's spinning and not know why  they say don't even do anything meaningful until they turn three because then they sort of start  remembering shit don't have to feed him or anything so don't like do the dizzy trip and all that shit  until after three yeah just do basic shit give him a give him a bubble wrap in a in a box 
[02:19:00]  plastic bag and a rubber band be very happy with that where's uh jamie he's i'm just reading his  twitter and he said uh about an hour ago headed over to the ona show uh with jim norton this  morning looking forward to meeting the whole team so he twittered it oh so he's probably on his way  yeah we're huge fans of the wire but he's promoting a movie called uh night catches us yeah it's uh what  is that uh thing uh it's a true i think it's a true story it's based on uh an incident that happened 
[02:19:30]  with the uh with the black panthers i think it's a true story but it's about the black panthers in philly  in the uh the old black panthers movement yeah no not the new guys the new silly ones the old  school the we mean business ones from the old days not the ones that will politely stand outside and  hold a stick but the ones that would hit you with it yeah blow police stations those guys they didn't  play games was it kind of pro or it was just it was about what it was it was much it wasn't it  honest about it yeah but it wasn't interviewing you about this because because i'm white you feel 
[02:20:00]  more comfortable with me yes exactly i'll be like great movie but no it wasn't scared it wasn't  about it was about a couple of guys in the panthers one guy comes back and um people think that uh he  snitched on somebody but it's not a pro and they they say like hey don't do that that's well not  quite that harsh i mean they do talk about it for us like let's be reasonable yes what were you  feeling go and and of course we don't from the wire and it's a show we just love stanfield yeah we're 
[02:20:30]  fanboys of the wire basically did you know they're they're teaching a class based on the  wire at harvard now i did i did hear that and it's in more than one school there's another one  um that might be doing what are you getting out of that i don't know but i don't understand these  goof classes in general maybe this is a good one the why i have to i remember asking about that the  wire as a class uh because i michael k way of his tweets about i follow these guys on twitter and uh  is uh michael k coming back or what yes he is all right good it's very interesting to me that they  would teach that as a class i don't know what the class entails it's about the drug culture 
[02:21:00]  because it was very we'll talk about when it gets here i'm just i'm all i'm gonna do is babble about  the wire that's all i never got i never got into the wire i never really saw it i just heard great  things about if you watch from the first dude it's fucking it's amazing the movie because every  every everyone the drug dealers the cops the press i think they're all treated very fairly like  they don't make just white cops look like there's one scene in the first season where there's a  beat down and it's inspired by the fucking uh the black lieutenant like there's so much they don't 
[02:21:30]  make the the white guys look terrible and they they balance it very well is it better than like  barney miller it's not quite as gritty barney miller had some gritty moments not as real  but eight bagot is much worse in the wire let's not forget about fish fish rules fish was great  fish was great i look at a mod squad they had no guns but they fucking fought crime yeah that's all  they needed was a unity yeah they had no guns they just needed unity man because they had link he was  the black guy can run fast and he was he scared everybody he scared everybody's big fro yeah 
[02:22:00]  that did it man peggy leptin was hot though you know how hairy her pussy must have been awful big  70s muff did you see that picture of demi moore from back in the day oh you see that it's too  unbelievable what a what a muff on her holy shit like you didn't you don't look at her and think  she'd have that that's like that crazy fetishy hair that was insane yeah it was almost like it  was fucking painted on yeah it was like a beard they bought at the halloween store are you shocked 
[02:22:30]  though we all went to war we all we all spend our time in the trenches to remember that i never  someone that hairy though not like that you never had one no you never hair's going down the legs  and stuff no no or at least the top of the thighs no you did oh yeah that's because you grew up on  long island man there's no i went to school in jersey's got a few yeah jersey has a few but  they worked on that fucking top of the head that hair more than they did yeah now he's the jersey 
[02:23:00]  chicks always had the landing strip they had that like you know before anybody else that was yeah  that was always the big one yeah i don't know what it is i think girls just naturally are are evolving  with less hair human beings are because it's like girls even if they don't shave for a while you  could kind of see where it's coming from and it's not it's not as crazy as it used to be just like  wild oh hey bro i looked up hey we're just we're just uh killing time and also i look up and there's 
[02:23:30]  jamie hector what's up jamie welcome to the show man that's jim florentine jim norton anthony  what's going on brother good good good we were just talking about hairy boxes yeah we actually just  got into that conversation how we think uh you know girls shave and they've been shaving for years now but  it seems like naturally they're just getting less hair than than in the old days when they would  have like a lot yeah it's my personal opinion personal observation we're free to join in or not 
[02:24:00]  we forget that no jamie's an actor who's used to just doing like regular interviews and the first  thing when you sit down welcome to the show listen hairy pussy or not what do you think  yeah we do things a little differently i said hold on that's the reason why i ain't got this coffee  which i don't drink i said i gotta wake up i'm sure yeah wake up you'll get into that whole thing  you'll be thinking about that later have you done satellite before this is like different than any  other radio npr oh no jesus this is the polar opposite of that shit yeah you can do whatever you 
[02:24:30]  want with a reason you can curse here it's great it's a good it's very free-form hang yeah npr is just  you know horrible you can talk about hairy boxes yeah yeah people want people won't care they'll join in  they'll call up and give you opinions were you crazy i met jay because people know i was trying  we were trying to get in studio for a while for the wire yeah he was just he was hard to get he was  working and i was at the uh bored to death premiere right for two episodes and uh somebody i was  downstairs talking to jim gaffigan and he goes yeah one of the guys from the wire was right in front of 
[02:25:00]  me i'm like who i just i fucking starts obsessing i really did and he goes oh he didn't know your name  he goes marlo i fucking bolted up the steps like a girl and fucking found him outside and just  attacked him i think i creeped him out i was like jamie hector jamie hector he's like what  no no he was no look jim is cool as a fan you understand he came over to me it was real smooth  and humble i was like look all right let's do it let's take this shot i was panicking  i was panicking i couldn't tell i do but i didn't know what this and then he's tried talking to me he's 
[02:25:30]  like so you're going to this party after the after party and i'm like no  jimmy does get very starstruck i don't know how to act around guys adorable jimmy way i don't  know but jimmy's a star i don't get it but i'm not though like i don't know how to act around guys i  like like method man uh when i saw him recently at okay he's great yeah great dude but i saw him  like three years ago and uh he was a big lucky louis fan so he came over and he hugged me he's like  oh god you should have won an emmy there's just being funny but i saw him in newark airport maybe 
[02:26:00]  six months ago and i was just too ashamed i'm like he won't remember me and i'll embarrass myself  in front of my girl i don't know how to act around people i like or don't like yeah or don't like i  just inappropriate everybody i'm basically garbage how would you describe uh i saw at night catch this  which i liked a lot uh how would you describe because i was trying to explain to anthony uh it's  about the panthers but it's really not it's it's more about the the interaction between these guys  it's a small piece of the panther party basically what happens to a person when they come back  from living the life of a panther so it's not about the entire panther party per se but it's 
[02:26:30]  more so a small fraction of a slice of the life of those that were affected by the panther party and  were part of the panther party oh and how it uh affected their lives yeah you know it's like that  the way tanya would describe it is as though a person was coming back from war and their life when  they came back because you know how long after the the they're in the panthers does it span well you  know what it's not too far after because it takes place in 1976 okay but the when when anthony  mackey's character returns the panther party is no longer in effect what my character do right is 
[02:27:00]  basically keeping it alive and um in trying to keep it alive he basically doesn't want any part of  that world anymore because you know it it it touched him severely so many a times when i would do panel  discussions um for the film you would have people in the audience and young ladies that would be like  look my parents were in the panther party and um after it died down my phone was still tapped we  were still being followed so the effects of it afterwards not too many people know about it but 
[02:27:30]  she tries to show it in this film it was really well acted and it was uh it's because i don't know  much about the panther party obviously they wanted me to join but whatever i'm on the road you would  have been great man all black on black very covert i would have been the one they sent to the police  meetings to get the information they'll never suspect you but what i'm amazed at watching you  act is uh because after avon barksdale who uh was was the the first drug lord in in the while you're  like there's no way they can follow this guy there's no way they can get an interesting guy 
[02:28:00]  oh and then you came along and i mean you still loved uh avon barksdale but your your character all  of a sudden was as interesting as his was right and you played a a horrible menacing guy i mean  it really was not a lot of very pleasant there really was not a lot of negotiation no not at all  that's what a lot of people tell me but you know i've seen that you know i have that debate with a lot  of um especially my young guys and um and young ladies in brooklyn and moving mountains like they 
[02:28:30]  tell me that he was a businessman and i say you know he was probably a businessman also but the guy  was basically it's his way of the highway you know yeah and and and that was an interesting way  of doing business there was there was yeah because there was it was beyond just making the money there  really was a sociopathic but there was a detachment from human life because uh like there's one scene  where we marlo walks into a uh a store and he's eating a lollipop he just steals a lollipop in front  of the old security guard and the security guard's like why'd you have to do that he's like i'm not 
[02:29:00]  calling you i'm not trying to step to you like the security guard makes it very clear right i'm not  looking for trouble you don't know what happens all of a sudden five episodes later they pull the  security guard's body out of a house that's why the wire was so good there wasn't a big scene where  you killed him but you just knew that he really got a fucking comeuppance for asking why he stole  the lollipop damn yeah it was such a fucking amazing role man and i never asked actors what  motivates them because i never want to hear it but i am curious as to how you interpreted this guy 
[02:29:30]  or how you get the realism like that unless you're doing that or in the life like that you know how  well you know what one thing that is definitely key is the writing you know the the the way it was  scripted we didn't ad-lib or paraphrase anything so they did a great job at that and for me personally  it was you know what what we do behind the scenes a lot of the things that we try to do we try to keep  it how can i say in a backpack so that we can always keep it alive for the next project that 
[02:30:00]  we have to work on also so i mean most of the ways that i would say is certain books that i read  certain songs that i listened to and just preparing early in the morning when i say preparing i mean  just basically being in a zone for that character did you see there's a scene where prop joe which is  one of my favorite scenes in the whole if you don't know the anyone who knows the see the show  in the in the last uh season prop joe's a big character and uh he thinks he's going on a trip  and then fucking jamie shows up with his guy yeah who is uh chris was uh bengay his name is bengay 
[02:30:30]  yeah we've had him in literally he plays he plays a horrible murderer and he's like the nicest guy on  the planet he really is nothing like the guy but uh they they show up and it's such a chilling scene  where joe knows he's about to be killed and he's trying to negotiate and you're like just close  your eyes joe oh it won't hurt and i'm thinking like are you actually just trying to be nice like  you know you have to kill him are you trying are you enjoying killing this guy you know what you  know for a character like marlo i think that's just a way of life for him and it's as snoop said in the 
[02:31:00]  car she was like look it's my time to go i gotta go this is the life that i lead and i know this is  part this is part of the life that i live just like do right he understands the life that he lives  is basically to protect the community and serve the community and night catches this marlo understands  from what i believe that he understands that look we gotta die you know you gotta die this is the  life you live if you try to escape this life you'll come back to this life so just take what you gotta  get that's some ruthless shit man this is called america this is what we do but it's just on a street 
[02:31:30]  level and that's so not that's so why i'm not cut out for that life because i would beg and plead  immediately go look i didn't mean it the whole thing was a joke i was nervous did you grow up uh  there was an incident you you were at you you live in flatbush now reach flatbush i live in  crown heights okay did you grow no i don't live in crown heights anymore i actually live in california  oh you're okay right did you grow up in that type of an environment was that like uh when you were  coming up did you see that a lot when you when you were a kid no i mean what i saw when i was a kid 
[02:32:00]  i mean i was surrounded by love i was part of a theater company when i was 16 16 17 years old  tomorrow's future theater company there was a lot going on and you see it because it's in the  environment of brooklyn alone even if you live in downtown brooklyn fort green brooklyn  it's an experience you know but i probably i experienced more of the love you understand  the family love the community love but of course you got your drama and things going on around the  corner when you when you uh this is the thing i love about jamie you there's like i i overact  everything if it wasn't for overacting i would never be on film i really do it's like i always 
[02:32:30]  look scared like what's he scared of nothing that's calm love but you never it was almost like i watched  you do scenes where you you hardly moved and i was awed by that to just be able to talk and and  project this thing that i can i'll never be able to do that still be compelling yeah yeah it's chilling  to just because somebody was just talking to you and not moving that's some scary reptilian  but it really it really it almost was it was like you would use you you were just being watched 
[02:33:00]  by i don't want to say a reptile to be insulting but by that mentality but you know because the funny  thing is is when you actually look at the other characters especially marlo you kind of look at  people as though they're smaller than you like they don't really exist as numbers you know right  you're a number basically and you know you're going to be utilized for your purposes or moved out the  way so in looking at people like that you just basically can look through them especially when  you're doing a scene with somebody that's really not supposed to exist to you if they're not worthy of 
[02:33:30]  anything that's exactly how we feel working here that's how they talk to us number i was wondering  why our bosses didn't move at all when they speak to us because we really are numbers just except we're  all zeros can i ask somebody can i have water i asked kenny for water i know i'm dying uh he probably  didn't get the text oh poor kenny look at him oh he's got his glasses on and everything does man you  guys look like i have fun up here man walking through here look for the world if you don't know  walking through just getting off the elevator and coming down the corridor it was amazing 
[02:34:00]  i mean it's like the kind of place you would want to come to work every morning if uh all the bosses  suddenly died then i can understand it would be great but uh yeah it's one it's one of those you  have a way to make it a real bummer for some reason because it should be the easiest job on the plan for  the four hours that we sit here and just bullshit it's great it's great but then when once you see  like one of them come walking down the hall he's just like oh here it comes a meeting about something or 
[02:34:30]  some kind of guy justifying his job it's like good night good luck right you saw that film yeah  oh yeah yeah i don't step into your business but when i step into your business you got to move  and make it shake yeah that's why i leave uh they usually have to replace the door every day i leave  my silhouette running to the elevator to get the fuck out of here every day man i don't like dealing  with any of them down the hall i hate it i just you know i got lucky and fell into this i'm not a  deal with management kind of guy thank you uh the the movie though uh night catches us right uh i was 
[02:35:00]  asking jimmy because he saw it i unfortunately did not yet but i will thank you uh it does it i know  the panthers is just a small like part of probably the the vehicle of the the rest of the story but uh  does what kind of light does it portray the panthers in is it trying to uh portray them in a  a good light a bad light or is it just this is what it was well it's you know it's not trying to 
[02:35:30]  portray them in a bad light at all it's just exactly what it was how they were affected and how  the pamphlets that were put out were actually put out by the feds and they're just trying to tell you  a true story about um a young lady and a gentleman that comes back into town and  how they were affected by the panthers so it's basically being portrayed in a good light but  and it's about the panthers but it's basically also giving you the opportunity to see it for what  it really was you know how it was really affected and it's just that they were they were humans 
[02:36:00]  you know sometimes you find out when you read history you'll find out that they were also  dehumanized as though they were not um strong enough to make wise decisions you know but when you  watch this film you realize that they were humans and that they were characters and there were people  that basically just wanted the basic necessities of life so they became community organizers and  leaders to try to make that happen and push it forward so they're trying to put it i mean i think  time is trying to basically put it at a level where you can see that these people were just basically 
[02:36:30]  regular people that were pushed to a limit and wanted to make something happen and effect change  i like films like that because a lot of times the certain groups are portrayed in one way  and it is kind of a mechanical machine you don't think of them as individuals or right or people  and uh when when you can see that in in certain movies uh i think that's really good a lot of times  um you'll see movies on insurgency right and stuff you'll see because you'll just see al-agbar and 
[02:37:00]  fire something off right but then when you see them as people you kind of start going like wow you  know that's got some kids and it's when you don't see it as a like a caricature of right right  yeah yeah not action movie type bullshit uh you know here's the bad guy here's the good guy kind  of a thing like that's what i don't need to obsess over the wire but that was to me the great part  or the great part of the movie crash it was like everybody is vilified and everybody is kind of given  a certain uh redemption it's like they really humanize everybody that's right you see the drug 
[02:37:30]  dealers showing mercy and having hearts but then you show them being complete motherfuckers  and being disloyal and you show the cops being disloyal but then you show the cops doing the  absolute right thing yeah yeah there was no like you couldn't watch it and get mad and go oh it's  bullshit that's why i like an honesty like that in a movie where it's like whether i like it or not  you know i'd rather see a kind of an honest assessment of what what people were doing or uh how they  were feeling acting uh during uh that time so right yeah it's pretty cool did you get did any of it 
[02:38:00]  affect you um watching the uh the wire because i know you guys would tape you wouldn't actually sit  there and watch the episode in a room together did any of it actually catch you off guard like you  didn't understand you didn't know something was going to happen or did you see the full script  every time you did an episode we would see the full script we would see like maybe a week  and a half before we had to shoot and you know every time we get a script we run through the pages  like who's going to die next because you know yeah start wiping people start wiping people out you know  this is the value of life it was not that you know high of it but then again when you're in the 
[02:38:30]  political realm when you find out that people are getting pushed out and the way they play in that  arena it's like um you're running for you might run for mayor today but your boy's gonna  stab you yeah that was good good too i i mean i i only caught i think a couple of seasons i still have  box sets to catch up on do a marathon but uh from what i saw i loved that whole thing with  you know the the again good guys were just as shitty and and corrupt politic yeah yeah and the 
[02:39:00]  politics as the the bad guys that they're trying to you know no one is safe put out of business you  know that's what i think is basically trying to tell you also no one is safe and there's no 100  good guy you know everybody has flaws but some people just cover them well yeah yeah you know and  under the guise of being a politician so you're like you know you're the good guy but you're doing  just as scummy shit as the dealer that's you know yeah yeah exactly just on another level  who was the hardest one for you to watch get killed i heard uh michael k williams interviewed 
[02:39:30]  he was talking about it was hard for him i think to watch bodie um get killed because he had worked  with him for a long time and used to see him going was there one that you watched and you were like  you know we i started the third season so every time from what the what they did on the show was  whenever somebody was going to get taken out especially if he was a part of the show for a while  we would all come down to set when it was lights out so um but for me personally of course the it  wasn't very difficult for me because you know you have lights cameras you have action you have okay 
[02:40:00]  boom it's down the third and then you have to do the shot i mean we we shoot the scene multiple times  right but bodie was a trooper but one of the most the the one that affected me the most i would have to  say was prop joe prop joe's a thespian the man is amazing as far as his talent goes and when you guys  get a chance to watch it you'll see what i'm talking about because if you see him in other  works also but um just doing that scene with him you know and and knowing that he's been a part of  the show since the beginning also and me actually being in front of him and we're we're and it's just 
[02:40:30]  it was just an emotional moment but i mean at the same time it was emotional but you know you get  pulled out of that because it's work you realize yeah it's work you realize it's works lights cameras  action boom won't hit your mark turn around and that scene with prop joe it took me i had maybe  four lines and i could not get the lines like i was so focused on him my lines was like i couldn't  get the lines in order so i would say the lines backwards and it was very important that those lines 
[02:41:00]  be said correctly so andre royal was sitting in the back like you got to get it man and um ed burns  like listen we need this line this way you know so you do you don't i mean i forgot the lines  exactly oh the lines were chilling uh one of them prop uh prop joe said to him i treated you like a son  and you're like i'm not meant to play the son wow that's a really hard one to negotiate with  a true sociopath wow is that where do you go from there because he really was good to your character  no but look you want to say prop joe was good but the reality is the man pushed a lot of buttons 
[02:41:30]  you're in a world where look is is life or death right and you got to live or you have to die  you looked out for me but in reality if you got to pinch my head you're going to do it yeah that's  prop joe so i'm not made to play his son because if you have to take me out you will set me up  because he was the one setting he was the true boss that's true if you really look the puppet master  kind of a puppet master you know so he can actually take me out if you wanted to which he probably tried  also yeah that's a good point i didn't think of it that way because yeah what was uh the line i don't 
[02:42:00]  want to do your your lines to you but there really was only a few of them but boy did they really hit  home runs they were great it was uh oh yeah he's like look he's trying to negotiate he's like i'll  just go away and you're like look we both know you'd be you'd be up to mischief in no time you can't  leave this any more than i can and then he just he tells me to close his eye close your eyes  that's pretty chilling right there it was almost like the only gentle moment  she's killing someone yeah that scene i watched over and over again because you i've never seen 
[02:42:30]  the wirehead whenever they killed somebody they humanized all these killings right where you felt  every one they didn't just again they didn't cartoon them where up that drug dealer you know what i  mean uh the only one that they they kind of uh showed indifference to was uh was omar's killing  because i think they wanted you to feel like this is how it really is this is how the streets view a  guy like this like yeah he's your hero because he's on the show but uh in real life his body bag gets 
[02:43:00]  mixed up and nobody gives a fuck yeah nobody cries when he dies means nobody gives a shit no at the  end of the day yeah you know you know what else is a a chilling scene in a movie that's sort of  reminiscent of that is um saving private ryan where that little jewish kid is having a fight with a  big nazi and knock down drag out upstairs and he takes the knife and he finally just the nazi  overpowers him and he's pushing the knife right into his chest and as he's doing he's just looking 
[02:43:30]  at him going shh shh like telling him to just be quiet it'll be over in a second just gonna  fucking stick this bayonet in your chest that was probably the hardest part of that movie to watch  and difficult to watch oh right because it's so brutal it's like god damn that probably happened  yeah but the shush nobody wants to be shushed not shushed when you're when you're uh yeah  i haven't told christ comes back to be quiet can i at least talk for a second here oh god yeah that's 
[02:44:00]  and you also know that you're begging and you're pleading is not as to no avail it's just worthless  you can't bargain it's like in uh in reservoir dogs where michael madsen oh yeah i don't care  what you say yep you don't say yeah i'm gonna torch you anyway i'm gonna torch you doesn't matter  and you knew he was gonna yeah that was it you remember that scene when he cuts the cops ear off  i mean yeah but just the fact that you you can beg and plead and that's the reason why for me movement 
[02:44:30]  is life no matter what you do don't beg just move you know move shape move and do what you have to do  to get out there like prompt joe if he would have just moved like grab something you know  but he sat there he took it scripted that he actually has to sit still but in reality it's like  move yeah but he was fat and he probably couldn't run too well and he didn't exactly come alone  he just kind of nodded at the guy behind him let's not forget to mention that fucking uh  uh chris partle had a fucking pistol at the back of prompt if this wasn't a voluntary suicide 
[02:45:00]  fucking fat joe in his old house at the kitchen table  he was in front of them and there was a guy behind him point a pistol at the back the old  just in case yeah just in case fatso tries to make it out the front door i've got that angle  covered also it was like uh when dennis hopper and true romance knows he's gonna die and he's like  you know i'm gonna i'm gonna piss these guineas off he just gave it up yeah he just okay he goes  yeah i mean let me just enjoy this cigarette because i'm gonna fucking die i'm gonna give you a  and he knew that i think he wanted to be killed quick too so he knew that if i if i fucking make 
[02:45:30]  them angry enough this guy will just grab a pistol as opposed to torture him i brought it back to true  romance i remember that's when i was in the city on 50th i actually snuck into the movie theater to go  that two dollar movie theater right stuck that two dollar i fucking used to go to it all the time  two bucks i snuck into the movie for two dollars and i'm still sneaking in yeah  like two or three movies yeah and it wasn't playing there yeah man true romance because  nobody saw that movie when it first came out because it had christian slater and he just did 
[02:46:00]  a couple romantic comedies and it was true romance it's like uh but i read it i remember reading  the review and tarantino wrote it i'm like i gotta go see this this is gonna be good and nobody saw  it in the theater though yeah you are kind of a little bamboozled by the title yeah you don't want  romance yeah but it was a good film unbelievable yeah it was fucking uh it was well directed the  dialogue was amazing and more ruthless stuff like gandolfini and that's how we got the role of  tony soprano yeah when he's in that hotel room with uh what's her name uh patricia arquette yeah 
[02:46:30]  patricia arquette and he goes turn around for me spin around for me no the other way the other way  and she gives this turn like oh he wants to look at my ass or something right and she turns  and he fucking was waiting with a right hand just slams her in the face and that grin he makes  that that smile he makes it yeah he kind of twists his head a little and smiles like ah that felt good  they fall for it every time you know this fucking ruthlessness i don't know what it is but people  really do enjoy watching that ruthlessness on on uh in movies and television it's just something 
[02:47:00]  that grabs you like fuck that is bad that unpredictable yeah yeah that that you know people love the  bad guy it gets you like it it frightens you in a way like god how do you handle a situation where  no one cares this person you can there's no magic word nope there's nothing you can say to make this  guy give a flying fuck about you you are dead or getting the shit beat out of you or whatever  it's just ruthless people love the bad guy because it's it's a safe chance to interact with the bad 
[02:47:30]  guy it's like you can always interact with good guys you know what i mean but how can i get close  to a bad guy and see how he is yeah without having to suffer and i think that's consequences of being  around that person yeah because normally the consequences of being around a bad guy are there's  you know you go to jail you're killed or there's something bad happens to you do you find out is it  easier to play a bad guy a good guy funny guy like what what's more difficult you've been in theater  since you're teens yeah you know what this all of the roles just approaching the roles to me is is 
[02:48:00]  reading the script enjoying it and then saying okay it's a go in regards to just working on a  character but it's not really difficult in playing one of the other look at something though and say  like i i don't think i can do that or not not a part that doesn't fit you but you don't think i i can  pull it off you know what sometimes it would be something that's just like the experience that maybe  i haven't experienced it wholeheartedly and it would have to be take intense research on it i'll  just look at it like hold on let me i'm trying to think of a character at the top of my head that i 
[02:48:30]  would say would be probably difficult or would have been difficult for me to approach but when it comes  to me i'll let you know but it's just basically something that is probably something that would  take a whole lot of experience and a whole lot of time on this earth right and understand it so  but is it easier to play uh the first question i was asking like bad and evil than it is to play good  and like happy no no for me personally it's like giving the opportunity to play a good and happy  guy i think i would do a great job because i'm a happy person and trans translate that into screen 
[02:49:00]  i'm miserable i think i could play an angry guy i'm grateful yeah but you know it's funny if you're  miserable you'll probably be better playing a good guy playing a good guy because you know most of the  time it seems like the opposites of what you get to play on tv same with comics comics are way better  dramatic actors than comedy actors right like jim would be a jim's a way better dramatic actor  than a comic actor that's only because i couldn't be worse as a comic actor my process of elimination  i therefore have to be better you know it's mathematics  bobby bob kelly um on louis show when he was playing his brother and he was all upset about 
[02:49:30]  the mother and stuff and i'm watching this going that's fucking bobby's like crying and shit  he's an actor right you watch him crying filled with emotions too and yeah yeah it's really odd  they're teaching a course at harvard on on the wire yeah sure did you uh show up for that you know  what and and yes speak in front of the class what what we showed up to harvard harvard actually  presented myself and michael mike was up here right uh he was on the show we were in the old 
[02:50:00]  studio he's coming back but he had i think a death in the family so he was he had to reschedule  yeah that's right well we yeah they presented us with an award at harvard wow um it was amazing  so yeah we actually sat down at least he got one award jesus christ amazing well uh what was the  course about the course is about obviously the wire but i mean in what you know what i didn't get full  details but it's about the social effects that people don't get a chance to experience and because 
[02:50:30]  the way that they addressed the students at harvard is look you guys are the haves and then you need  to understand the have-nots and you get a chance to look at the wire from a political standpoint um  the streets the board of education all of these institutions that people don't really get a chance  to see as a whole you actually get a chance to watch it and from what i understand they view a couple of  episodes choose which one they want to address and then i think they write a paper on it and then they 
[02:51:00]  come to class with it wow yeah what a great class that would be i could go to harvard no kidding  if that's one of the classes you know it's you know that's a way better class to take than the  horseshit i taught i would write three pages on why didn't he just pay for that lollipop  why would you risk getting in trouble oh the professor uh jimmy i think you missed the point  and that leads to what you were going to say jimmy about the awards no awards for the wire  which just amazes that drives us crazy not not a one that what do you think that's about i guess 
[02:51:30]  everything in time i mean you fast forward that was a political thing or uh you know look like  everything in time i guess you know because you sit back and you watch so many you know what i don't  know the answer to that question to be honest it's crazy it really is yeah i'll let you guys answer  that yeah did he get any nominations or did he get a writing nomination it did now actually i believe  we won okay for writing in season five no not season five i think i can't remember the exact 
[02:52:00]  season but we did certainly not season two right it's funny people i like season two but it's very  different than one three four and five but it shows you you know it exposes what's going on the docks  yeah the docks i thought were great it just it was better the second time to watch it because you  know that each season's going to change like you had this whole cast of characters and then all of a  sudden in season two there's all these dock workers like what's i get shows and they killed  fucking the lead from season one gets choked in jail and you're like oh boy oh yeah yeah yeah 
[02:52:30]  larry gill yeah what's happening larry you know the the docks the beautiful thing about the docks to  me is that it exposes everyone i was asked the question look they don't make guns in new york  how does the guns come in new york where all these drugs and guns and everything coming in and they  expose it on the docks you know yeah coming through the harbor and they also touch into the lives of  the people that are being affected by it people are struggling and if you're struggling if you're  working at the airport you're making two dollars an hour it might just turn the other cheek if  somebody offers you fifty thousand dollars to do some dirt you know just like the docks you know 
[02:53:00]  somebody turns around and they're not getting paid then they may just open up to people that are  offered them more money so they can feed their families not that we agree with that of course you  know we basically say you know us good people we will say look take the two dollars and just  yeah go about your business yeah but on the docks they said something different yeah it's really  weird seeing jamie i realized one thing during the interview i didn't understand it was like what  he looks different i'm like oh it's a smile i was gonna say the exact thing i never saw your smile 
[02:53:30]  he didn't smile once in the wire no i had teeth no thank you kenny i never saw you smile in the  wire i can't get over how i think you only yell once in the series there's only one time he yells  where i broke my cool uh yeah and that was in jail and he was annoyed that his guy was trying to tell  him what he should which he's like you don't need that on your mind that he yells about don't tell me  what i need on my mind it's like you know it's like corporate america you don't want to micromanage 
[02:54:00]  the people that you have but at the same time you want to know what the hell's going on you want to  know what's going on on the bottom floor but you don't want to have to come back and ask you so  if people are running around screaming your name out on the streets and trying to embarrass you and  trying to call you a little guy then you basically want to know but they felt like they could have  handled the situation themselves but they couldn't that was the only time he raised his voice in uh i  guess what two and a half seasons you're on yeah it was which is really amazing all i would have done  was yell lines like hey you oh yeah i've got drugs for sale bob and i just bob 
[02:54:30]  i love doing these acting examples but they're all very accurate they're actually better than i  would have done it but to me to see somebody i've never seen a guy so ruthless played so quietly and  that to me was with the most amazing like they did those drug commercials years ago for anti-drugs  where they just had silence and uh remember that those commercials there was no words there was no  noise and then you look up and there was something happening the sound was broken on your tv 
[02:55:00]  and then you fix the rabbit ears and go but but they said that what the reason they did that was  because people are will look when they hear nothing oh right like something's broken so you like you'll  take a look up the television and it was like that was kind of what maybe i'm overanalyzing it but to  me that was the most amazing part was it was it was just so quiet and so silent and it was but it  wasn't boring it was really it was ruthless i'm fucking a lot right now well you know it's  understanding you jim in meeting with ed and david when i went and read for the part they i think they 
[02:55:30]  were looking for that kind of a quality you know because if you take away everything negative that  marlo as well as avon and stringer bell all the negative that they did then you realize that they're  disciplined individuals basically going after what they want and they're focused they have tunnel  vision and they go after what they want and they get it however they get it so i think they wanted  to see that sort of discipline and that sort of drive in the character even if they're doing it 
[02:56:00]  without words to me were you guys annoyed too because now everybody now now i did an episode of  bored to death and i was on actually with uh with dominic uh oh damn long yeah what's going on  dominic yeah he was my see i wasn't supposed to be him was supposed to be another actor who i guess  had other commitments or i got fired whatever happened and um i show up in the van and he's in  the van wait i'm like it's you and um genuine guy oh he's fucking great man he is what a what a 
[02:56:30]  great dude but was i what was i mentioning him i don't know just to mention no no i did an episode  name dropping yeah you were name dropping no i wasn't i did an episode of board just like no i  wasn't you're just like jamie hector is what you're trying to say well you know yes men like he and i  but no i actually had a point i fucking forgot it what his birthday was coming up and you got him  beetle books just to catch you up those those books don't tell i'm an ozzy osborne fan and he 
[02:57:00]  was in studio and i bought him birthday gifts and he appreciated them but then forgot them when he  left wow yeah yeah that's embarrassing he has some great gifts over here yeah they were wrapped and  everything jamie i wrapped them too oh my god he wrapped them on the fucking show he unwrapped on the  show this is fantastic when you get an ozzy osborne a gift you don't have to wrap it all right did you  wrap it yourself you got it wrapped no i had the gift shop people do it at the bookstore with a bow 
[02:57:30]  no i didn't get a bow but if they offered one i probably would have  we're it up he did tell ozzy that he had a gift card in case ozzy want to return the books yeah  i get a gift receipt i'm like you want to bring it back i gotta i did give him a little card you  know how it is who's your do you have a hero you gotta have an idol  turn it around of course i'm moving it along it's humiliating it's like you're showing him  footage of me blowing somebody here look at norton what uh do you have a uh who's who's somebody  you've been nervous meeting you have an idol no i'm not nervous meeting anybody really but i mean 
[02:58:00]  people i respect are regular everyday people my mother hard worker her entire life you know  and um and i appreciate that you're not starstruck by people now well you know i appreciate  the work and you know the closer you get to people you realize that you have more in common  than you have different and and and i just just dig socializing with people but i mean that's not  truly starstruck was there is there an actor you idolized growing up um man i always always loved 
[02:58:30]  the ones that i think everybody truly do love i mean like denzel you know i love his work because  you know in watching him especially in malcolm x yeah and in watching him and um and and and  in the great debaters and all of these projects i truly enjoy watching denzel watching um daniel day  lewis and what he does and and and how he prepares for projects and understanding his work 
[02:59:00]  the method of his work and how he approaches his work i truly appreciate that also but there's  so much it's like so difficult to narrow it down because i don't really love just the actor i love  the film so it's it's for me it's a combination of the work but if you if you were doing a film  with denzel and you know it was his birthday would you go out and buy him beetle books and get him  wrapped and then say look if you don't like him here's a gift card you can bring him back  leaving it on the console all dejected but denzel i'm sure leaves him in his trailer yeah 
[02:59:30]  i know why i mentioned oh okay um because i met dominic no okay that's not why it was because um  ted danson who's uh dance is the lead in that it was uh talking to him and watching the way the other  actors uh treated him with such reverence because he was a part of the wire it was like 
[03:00:00]  the business they were all like because ted danson was like you have you have a minute he's  walking he's like the wire it's like everybody just wants to talk to these guys about the what  it's almost like it's so annoying that it didn't get the acclaim it deserved but people in the  business uh love fucking actors love it like you know anybody who's got respectability loves the  show so you'll have that forever which has got to be at least and that's basically the acclaim right  there you know understanding that we we none of us did it alone like marlo um dom lom any none of us 
[03:00:30]  could actually we could have never done the show alone without the writers without the cast so it's  really a cast the ensemble cast but at the same time disregard the awards because the truth is the  love that you receive from the people that truly appreciate and you got it you know when people  script a screenplay or you have it on screen or a television show you want the people to get it  you know even though it's your baby you really want the people to understand what you're trying to  convey and when that happens it's like dang it happened you know you really dig the show you 
[03:01:00]  really appreciate the work and you're not looking at marlo or um avon boxdale or string of bell or  bode as drug dealers you're looking at them as humans that basically was raised in an environment  that produced this kind of a person and they took it around with it and the effects and the positive  and the negative of that also so you know that's basically the acclaim right there and that's what  we appreciate you seem like a very uh like intense uh uh technical actor like like somebody that  because i noticed from just talking to you it's i've talked to other actors that just kind of yeah i show 
[03:01:30]  up and you know i get a part and think yeah what the fuck i do that stuff but you seem like you've you  really study this and uh really know the the the art of acting that's what i i like that the most  yeah for real like it's funny because i was talking about rappers yesterday so i was on um  youtube i don't want to forget exactly what you said but this has something to do with it and i was  that's fine i'm just babbling till 10  see we're good actors too the way you address acting is exactly how he doesn't address radio 
[03:02:00]  that's what i'm talking about i was on youtube yesterday and i was putting on cool g rap and  big daddy kane and rock him and nas and jay-z and i was saying dang on it you know these dudes are  true artists like they really appreciate the work ghostface raekwon because they're still here today  really trying to put out the work and for me that's what i love i just love the the intrinsic 
[03:02:30]  value of the craft like the yeah yeah because like i said do you look at the way other people  approach acting when you're working with them and think like you know this guy's not taking it as  seriously or no not really as long as the job gets done as long as they the results if you get the  results the way that you throw it up against the wall is up to you um some people approach it  differently some people external they come out and it's like they rather wear it than come from the  inside out hey if it works for you and if you get the job done let's go you know um i'm gonna respond 
[03:03:00]  off of you though yeah do you really have to know a character do you do um really study who you're  playing or can you yeah that's what works for you that's what works for me so how much of yourself  though are you putting into a character or do you just really literally take who you're playing and  try to portray that well it starts off with me yeah the truth it starts off with me but then just  exploring the character hopefully what you explore you can actually apply that into yourself also 
[03:03:30]  you understand so yeah that's but it's something i and obviously that's why you're an actor uh it's  something i just can never fathom like i i would always put i think too much of myself in something  and i'd feel odd trying to portray somebody else i don't know it's just that's why i i really uh  but that's where the quiet time comes in also yeah yeah the quiet time the observation the the you  know just the being around other people that you like to i'm sure you can if you had to play gym 
[03:04:00]  right now you'd probably be able to do it i'm sure you could get around them every day  you just get a tranny you hate yourself put on 10 pounds of your man tits i'm very easy to play  10 pounds of man tits i'm in such a self-hatred spiral with my body but isn't it isn't it tough  to audition when you have to play off another actor when they're just reading lines you know  sitting behind a table and they're doing it just like so why'd you murder that guy and then you got  you know it's tough i've always had a tough problem with that how do you deal with that i think that's 
[03:04:30]  why some people just can't audition it's not it's kind of difficult sometimes for people to audition  you know they want to see your work in an audition room but the reality if the person that's reading  with you isn't giving it to you you have to be prepared for that person also like and if they  just don't do it then you have to act like they're doing it some people don't do that well it's better  off to just you know put them in a room with somebody that's doing it or i don't know where  they offer people parts out here as far as like work but some people work way better on set now when 
[03:05:00]  you got these parts did you have to do it in front of like you know just a producer some woman just  reading the lines no flat or did you no no fortunately for me i was able to i had the opportunity  of doing it in front of someone that was passionate someone that took time to read it and ask a couple  of questions okay you know yeah and then it's like okay you're reading with that person and you're  feeling something yeah just someone chewing gum talking there's nothing worse i had that with  someone before where they just grabbed the script and it was just like all right you ready yeah let's  go oh jesus okay okay okay and now you got to react with the emotion that you would if they had done 
[03:05:30]  it properly wow that's where your work comes in hopefully it kicks in yeah yeah yeah let me figure  out how i'm gonna maneuver around this cat yeah well it's it's when you're going on tape it's hard  too because every mistake is like every eye thing it's like when you watch yourself on tape like  rewind it and see it 20 more times i took a class on there it didn't stick but i mean i remember what  he said where if you look down but it's amazing what you lose on a taped audition oh yeah and i did 
[03:06:00]  one recently it was for uh what the the alec baldwin meryl streep movie it was uh whether like  a divorced couple who's look it was horrible i love that film oh did you like it i didn't see it just  i look i auditioned for it so i hate it because i did terrible was there a part for a hotel doctor in  that do you remember there's a hotel doctor oh yeah oh you do remember yeah i saw that movie too i  auditioned for the hotel doctor i remember who got it anybody but me would have been better  my audition was so bad i realized while i was doing like i'm bombing and i said can we just stop 
[03:06:30]  because sometimes that shows them that you're willing to do that jay jay moore did that when  he's auditioning with tom cruise uh for uh jerry mcguire he wasn't happy with it jay if you're  listening i think that's what you did he goes all right can we start over and they love the fact  that he had the balls to do that with oh without a doubt with tom cruise and uh they did and they  get him the part but it didn't work that way for me oh i said can we start over the casting  directors no no no i'll just edit at the end before i send it oh which no no one's going to edit  oh no make a good performance out of a piece of shit performance you know you had a shitty audition 
[03:07:00]  when you when the guy before you was in there for like 20 minutes and then you go in and you're out  30 seconds yeah he's still putting his coat on in the fucking lobby if you're on your way out  that's gonna be so many times that's when you know yeah that's when you walk out first thing you do  is man call your manager like damn yeah i don't think you don't have to make a call on that you  don't have to check my manager always try to spin it though we have the same manager who's really  tries to be positive he's like no no no they said that it was really good they really they're fans 
[03:07:30]  they like it's like they're not fans you don't have to talk me off a ledge they're not a fan no  more yeah they were fans you you teach martial arts too right or you take yeah i've taught i mean  i've um trained as well as taught um martial arts because that's what some of that i think some of  that centeredness you were asking about that could come from i gotta agree because melvin  williams he played the deacon on the show he was some people say the real over avion boxdale  oh wait oh wait wait wait wait uh the deacon oh yes okay yes yeah so he was a martial artist 
[03:08:00]  and my first experience with him you know buzz on the set was about him and everyone was talking  about him melvin is coming on the show melvin and you know ed burns is the one that um locked him up  and then when he was released after a couple of years i think 20 something years he gave him a part  on the show oh right yeah because avon barksdale there's a real avon barksdale he's a real guy okay  yeah but melvin basically had baltimore locked in in regards to like drugs and everything right 
[03:08:30]  so my first experience with him i was walking into my trailer made a mistake opened his door this guy  was laying down in the dark oh shit with his head propped up a little bit and just look tv off  everything off and just laying there still as ice and i was like okay i get it wow i get it so i said  my fault man you know i shut the door and i exited and then his training is in martial arts also to  understand that he has an iq that's amazing like total recall and he never wrote anything down if 
[03:09:00]  you basically check him out he basically never wrote anything down he was a numbers guy he kept  everything in his head mathematics so he never had any evidence where they could have called him  with the guy that played the preacher who was trying to get money the guy for the guy who uh  who uh the the preacher in that show was it was a drug dealer in real life the the deacon the deacon  yeah yeah yeah he was he was heavy in the game he was heavy matter of fact they did a um piece on  him on american gangsta on bt he was the uh the older guy who was who was uh kind of who was telling 
[03:09:30]  the guy to uh cutty to get them to box yeah one of my favorite lines that he had also was like when  when when when he was speaking to a politician and they were talking about drugs and matter of fact he  was speaking to i think colvin he was talking about drugs he's like trying to stop drugs is  like sweeping leaves on a windy day that was one of my favorite lines yeah it's a great line yeah  it's like it's difficult you know what martial arts do you take karoshi dope shotokan and what  that's japanese i heard shotokan i'm like you know japanese  that was more of a guess than acknowledge shotokan just sounded japanese how long have you been taking 
[03:10:00]  it man i was training for at least eight years are you black belt brown brown yeah do you watch  mma but don't fuck man i love mma but i will not get in the ring with these guys these guys it's like  life and death and death yeah might not come out yeah they really are uh we're i mean i let's my  favorite sport to watch and i was gonna train but you know the shoulder yeah it was attached to my 
[03:10:30]  hand which was attached to my dick so i never went to the gym and i guess that gives you a uh  that that the martial arts treats teaches you such discipline which really has to help when you're  acting it does it teaches you discipline it teaches you to always be awake and aware um of your  surroundings as well as you know the value of the people you know you're walking down the street you  you know what you can do to another person based on what you're taught and it's like natural response 
[03:11:00]  as to what you'll do but you know that you can actually hurt somebody also but you have a love  for the art so much that you're not really trying to apply that when's the last fight you had  maybe when i was in a dojo when we had to spar you know you know what it was it wasn't a real fight  but it was with curtis martin we went down to a gym over there on the lower um curtis martin the football  player yeah he took me into the ring oh shit we basically tapping around yeah he turned me on  to it and i realized my wind was down can he box yeah he's nice yeah he got gifts oh what were you 
[03:11:30]  like after a few minutes you're like fuck i was like god look i'm lost my shoulders like you know  boxing and martial arts are different you know martial arts you get a chance to lose your legs  um your hands but in boxing it's just basically your hands so i'm seeing various ways to actually  open them up with a kick but no i can't use it no no it's just the hands but yeah he's amazing  to hear from a lot of boxers or guys getting into boxing is the hardest part is holding those  goddamn gloves up for the i'm telling you round his shoulders turn to bricks you can't even keep them 
[03:12:00]  up especially when somebody's punching them that's all that always makes it a little rough too it's  almost like when your motivation because i hit the heavy bag um not in a while but i i i used to hit the  heavy bag and it's wonderful it's a great exercise but i i would always hit it wrong and  hurt myself i'm like i'm a fucking girl i just can't do man shit that's a hard thing to do properly  i would think because you know impact like that you're gonna fuck something yeah but i was slapping 
[03:12:30]  it yelling rape blowing a whistle jimmy rules we gotta make sure that people know about his movie yes  it really we're obsessed with the wire as you can see i appreciate that man i'm glad we do what we  they never shy away from i love that too like on twitter appreciate that uh jamie hector just  at jamie hector on twitter or and uh like him or or michael they never shy away they were on super  train it's a good show but a lot of actors like move like well that was then this is now but these  guys embrace that all the time i'm right move on and yeah no i'm sorry no no i was gonna say it's 
[03:13:00]  nice to see guys not you know yeah well they know they know it was good i mean i mean if you do the  job you're proud of yeah and people love the work yeah thank you you have to shake off a role because  i know some actors have to like it really affects them doing it and i you know if you do that's fine  and dandy but i always thought it was kind of like really you gotta shake that off you got so you know  what i think you probably would have to shake off a role when you don't even realize that you are doing 
[03:13:30]  what the character has done oh really you understand like like if like for one scene i think it was it  was on the show i i would wake up and i would walk down to the harbor but the way that i approached the  women was totally different from how jamie would approach the female really so it was kind of bold  and it was like come in let me talk to you pull you over you know as marlo right so you're thinking  like what the but now yeah so so now if you really think that afterwards the cameras are off and  you you need not research that character anymore and you still walk out and you still try to do 
[03:14:00]  that then you basically didn't shake off the role but i don't think it's something that truly damages  a person yeah because i i mean this a lot of unless you're dating a real drug dealer who  a lot of times it's uh usually an actress that i've seen that do this where they talk about how it  took them so long to get out of the role and it's like i'm well didn't that ruin nicholson's  first marriage or one of his marriages more flew over the cuckoo's nest oh really he brought that  character home and he just destroyed his family because you you tend to i think you're it's a 
[03:14:30]  fun guy to take home like you go over and you know you this is the world that you live in where  you're you're you're you're a womanizer as a character and you want to really experience that  right yeah that that would seem and if there's something that you have you experience and you  you'll probably think that you're detached from it but these are the things that affect you  you kind of pick up a part of the personality in a way yeah that's kind of i guess it would almost 
[03:15:00]  be like an undercover guy uh you know going into the mob or gang uh and and usually they have a  hard time coming back out especially if they've been in for for years exactly uh it i guess it's  probably natural to pick up parts of personalities if you have to portray them long enough yeah oh  definitely especially if you're constant like you you have to if you have to like for instance  substitution with somebody and then you go over and it's a female that you were in love with 
[03:15:30]  10 years ago and now you're working on that female for maybe two three four days you know  maybe you'll probably try to contact her eventually you know and this is like so that means that it's  still affecting you you know you're not supposed to you're married you have a family you don't want  to contact but then it's like damn this girl is on my mind why is she on my mind for why am i  constantly thinking about this girl i was dating in high school or something like that so in ways  of that affecting you i think yeah yeah was that a real jamie hector moment has it happened  no comment you're married man right i am hi kids happily yes how old how old um 16 months oh okay 
[03:16:00]  yeah these guys just became fathers in there yeah oh congratulations man that's why the tired faces  listen there's a website guys that i heard about that teaches men how to actually step into this world  really coming to father yeah i mean i never used it but never go to that one i always go to porn  yeah what website yeah submit your ex-girlfriend.com every website i go to shows you what not to do
