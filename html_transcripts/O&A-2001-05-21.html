<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the hosts' experience at a Tool concert, focusing on the brutal mosh pit and Opie's age-related aversion to it.  This transitioned quickly into a frank and frustrated discussion of their precarious contract situation with WNEW, with only 10 days remaining and significant uncertainty about renewal.  They aired their grievances about perceived lack of support from station management, missed opportunities for syndication and merchandising (like "wow window clings"), and a belief that the station actively sabotaged their success to protect other programs. They felt undervalued despite consistently high ratings.  Callers responded, some expressing disbelief, others offering support, with one, George, corroborating their claims of poor treatment by the station, and another, Rich, questioning why they'd even consider re-signing.  The hosts alluded to legal complexities preventing easy departure or relocation.

A substantial portion of the show then dissected the latest *Sopranos* episode, with the hosts and callers expressing widespread disappointment at the lack of resolution and overall underwhelming nature of the finale.  Specific criticism targeted the abrupt killing of Jackie Jr. and unresolved storylines.  Listener calls continued to intertwine with the *Sopranos* discussion and their ongoing frustrations with WNEW management.

A surprise call from Frank Vincent (Billy Batts from *Goodfellas*), initially disguising his voice, added another layer to the conversation. Vincent discussed his acting career, confirmed involvement in an upcoming mob film, and echoed the hosts' criticism of *The Sopranos* finale. The segment concluded with further discussion of *The Sopranos*, other TV shows, and the hosts’ uncertain future.

The broadcast then featured a sexually explicit advertisement for "Ultimate V," a male enhancement product, delivered with heavy use of vulgar language and graphic sexual descriptions.  This was followed by a call from Devon, an actor claiming minor roles in *Home Alone* and *The Lost Boys*, who was subjected to ribbing about his perceived fame and meager royalty checks.

The conversation returned to the hosts’ employment situation and unfair treatment by CBS, alleging a colleague, Will, was being fired for not competing against them in the afternoon, while they were prevented from competing in the morning slot.  This highlighted the perceived hypocrisy and their desire for greater on-air content freedom.  They speculated about potential CBS employees listening to the show.

A segment followed where listeners called in with outrageous and sexually suggestive ideas to win NSYNC tickets, featuring proposed acts of sexual humiliation and bizarre activities, encouraged and embellished by the hosts.  The relative merits of Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears' physical attributes became a recurring theme.  The segment continued with crude humor, offensive language, frequent interruptions, and inappropriate jokes. The tone remained highly irreverent and sexually charged.

Later in the broadcast, the hosts engaged in sarcastic banter, mocking someone called "Jack," calling him a "pussy" and criticizing his intelligence. This transitioned into further complaints about WNEW, specifically excessive promotional announcements and difficult negotiations with management.  A prank call followed from an enraged Canon laptop customer, filled with profanity. The conversation shifted to a celebrity softball game hampered by New Jersey officials, leading to a call with Lady Die, one half of what the hosts referred to as their "retarded Laverne and Shirley" duo.  Lady Die was evasive about rumors, including potential job issues and a medical procedure.  The conversation became increasingly vulgar, featuring graphic details and sexual innuendo about Lady Die's body and medical history.

A call with Jamie-Lynn Sigler (*The Sopranos*) ensued, where the hosts discussed her career, portrayal of Meadow Soprano, and personal life rumors, including explicit discussion of sex scenes and pregnancy.  Questions about her body and perceived sexual behavior were also included.  The show returned to Lady Die and another caller, Marion, with extended, vulgar conversations about their bodies, sexual experiences, and personal lives, marked by relentless teasing and insults from the hosts. The show concluded with advertisements for Auto Lock and New York Sports Clubs, with Marion and Lady Die remaining on hold for extended periods.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The latest from Tool Schism to start off the O&A show on 1027 WNEW, sending that out to everyone that was at the show last night.  Good God, Tool Rock, it's loading open.  I lost my voice, we were screaming and jumping around like lunatics last night.  We in the pit? I heard the pit was pretty raunchy. The pit was pretty cool, without a doubt.  Did you take a little pace to get in there and knock some heads? 
[00:00:30]  You know what I was saying before the show, I know I'm getting a little older because I was looking at the pit going, good God.  Yeah, there was a day I used to be in the middle of that pit.  Were you in the VIP pit?  I was hanging with Jim and John and the rest of the gang from Metro Power Pit.  Yeah.  Thank you very much for those fine, full pits.  Nice.  No, the pit was unbelievable, love.  Yeah, you reached a point where you're like, why am I even going near that?  Hey man, it looked cool as hell and I was getting really like revved up just checking it out. 
[00:01:00]  It looks good.  I remember the last pit I was in, it was Chili Peppers at Roseland.  And I believe they were touring with Pearl Jam and Smashing Pumpkins at the time.  And I was right up front and just got thrown right into it.  And I left saying, what am I, insane?  Right.  But there's no reason for me to be here.  Yeah.  And that was it.  Remember the time in Boston when we were doing a little rock TV show?  Yes.  And we did a little piece live called XFL Game Day. 
[00:01:30]  No.  Oh, no, okay.  No, real rock TV.  More people saw real rock TV.  Oh, on the Spanish station in Boston than ever saw XFL Game Day.  And we did a little segment from the middle of the corn pit.  Yeah.  I know.  Trying to actually do a break.  We were trying to do a segment live from the, yeah, the mosh pit.  Oh, my God.  That was insane.  It's insane, yeah.  The people see you have a camera on you, so they really put an extra effort into getting  that elbow into your nose. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, thank you.  Sam from Hoboken, right away, Opie would only go in the pit if it was 60 feet underwater.  Very funny.  Opie's fighting near the Bahamas there.  Turks and Caicos underwater.  Very funny reference, Sam.  But, yeah, Tool's coming back later on this summer, and I don't have to tell you, highly  recommend you go see Tool.  They're doing something a little different.  The video clips they had going behind Maynard.  Well, they're known for some pretty sick stuff.  Good God.  Tell you the truth.  Good God. 
[00:02:30]  You know, when I first saw the video for Sober.  Right.  And you couldn't take your eyes off the screen, like when Tool first broke.  With the sludge going through the pipe.  What the hell?  It's like a nightmare.  The old man just sweeping.  Yeah.  And the drug didn't help either, because then you're watching it and you just come freaking  out.  Tease me, of course, Opie.  You know I don't use any.  Right.  So, what's up, man?  How much?  Having fun after the weekend, of course.  It's been very busy in our lives.  Yeah.  And, like, I can't enjoy them. 
[00:03:00]  I hate this.  It's like when you're flying a vacation or something, and you're all ready to have a  good time.  And all of a sudden, the pilot comes on and says, we're not clear for landing yet.  We're going to have to circle for a while.  And we're just circling forever.  And it's taking forever.  What are you talking about, Anthony?  I'm talking about our lives.  Yeah.  Who the hell knows?  What's today's date here?  It's the 21st.  May 21st, we have 10 days left on our contract.  That's what you're saying?  Yeah.  May 21st, 2000. 
[00:03:30]  Right, Stinky?  No, of course, 2001.  Yeah, and we have no clue.  We're 10 days away from the end of our contract, and we are not even close.  So, it's kind of hard to come in here and act like everything's fine and dandy when there's  a reality here, that in 10 days from right now, we may not be broadcasting from here.  Correct.  Which is just insane.  How the hell do you come in? 
[00:04:00]  How do you come in to do a show?  I don't know.  We're talking with people right up until showtime.  I know.  I'm running out of the building to have quick meetings in coffee shops.  Huh.  It's insane.  Like, do we even put the effort forward here anymore?  Well, no one's really talking enough, because everyone's really, like, kind of tense around  here.  Yeah, because it's all in the hands of people that handle these things.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Like, I saw Jeremy a few times today.  I was just kind of nodding at him. 
[00:04:30]  What am I going to say to him?  So, it's like, hey.  You know, you give a wave.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, we might be leaving this mess soon.  Hey.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey.  No, I'm sure the station will be fine without us.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah, I'm not.  You'll be fine.  I'm not worried about...  You guys will be okay, and we'll be okay.  If things happen that we're not here in 10 days, I'm really not going to lose sleep  over any W.  Joe, what's going on?  Guys.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  Why are you pulling this wax stunt like someone else did a couple months ago?  You know, like, going for Christmas?  You know, someone else did the same thing?  Joe.  Joe.  What?  It's not a stunt.  It's reality.  We really don't know what's going on.  Come on, bro.  You guys know you're going to be around at least five to six more years.  We're going to be in New York Radio.  That's...  Yeah.  All right, guys.  Whatever.  All right?  Bye.  See, and that's another thing.  It's hard to even come on here and talk about it because, first of all, no one believes 
[00:05:30]  you.  Right.  No one really...  You know, you've got listeners that go, oh, this old gag.  And it's...  I think you can tell.  You know, I think we've been on the airwaves here long enough, and we're pretty honest,  and you could listen to us and tell if we're pulling a gag or something.  If you think it's a stunt, whatever.  Yeah.  It really isn't.  Yeah.  I wish I could say more.  Yeah.  I wish I could say more.  It's going to get very interesting this week.  I'm reading a lot of instant feedback. 
[00:06:00]  People that are very up on what's going on, people that don't have a clue, and people that  are very funny.  Right.  It's no secret anymore.  There are so many people involved with our negotiations.  Yeah.  Trust me.  This is no stunt.  Yeah.  So we've got no clue.  It's like, oh.  So you come in, and, you know, it's 10 days.  10 days.  They'll take a look around, you know?  Like, hey, look at the studios.  They'll be here.  Who the hell knows? 
[00:06:30]  I should tell people this.  I think we could say this much.  If we're gone in 10 days, we're gone for a while.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because they will not allow us to broadcast anywhere else for a while.  Right.  And that kind of freaks me out a bit.  Yeah, that sucks.  It won't hear us for a while.  We'd have to sit out, as they say.  We'll be taking the summer off for a while.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  All right.  So what else is up? 
[00:07:00]  Have you been able to concentrate on anything?  No.  No, not at all.  I know.  My weekends, I'm like, I can't do anything.  I seem like a retard to play EverQuest for days on end.  I can't do anything.  I'll tell you one thing that's kind of weird.  I don't want to really play my hand, but I'll tell you this much.  It's no secret that the company treated us like crap the last three years.  No secret whatsoever.  Yeah, it's obvious.  That's things that have been going through our head.  Every three months, we're being punished for stuff while they're making money like you wouldn't believe from this radio show. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  And we get punished.  We get pulled in and told why we're not getting this or that.  That we would like.  There was always an excuse why we weren't syndicated.  Always an excuse why we can't put out our CD.  Always an excuse why we're not going to make more money.  No support.  You know what I mean?  No one pisses me off.  This is what I found out recently from a very reliable source.  When we got here three years ago, the most it would cost for a commercial on our radio show, $300. 
[00:08:00]  That's what Joey Paisano paid.  $3 to $350.  Our first live read, I remember.  Okay.  For live reads.  Now they're getting ten times that.  Major cake.  But we're the problems.  You know, we're out of control.  Yeah.  We've been told we've F'd the company.  We've F'd this guy and that guy.  But now that we have ten days left on the contract, all of a sudden, they want to be nicey-nice. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  To a point.  And you know what?  That pisses me off.  And there's problems here at the station.  And it's, you know, this station is exactly where it was overall.  No, it's worse.  Yeah, it's worse.  It's worse than it was.  And, you know, they're going to get pissed down the hall like we're trashing the place again.  No, not really.  We're just giving facts.  Yeah.  Three years ago when we came here, the overall station was at a 1.7.  Yeah.  It's now at a 1.5 after three years.  Yeah. 
[00:09:00]  And that's with our pretty good ratings.  And no one seems to, it's not a big deal.  Which leads me to believe that this whole station, this is nothing new.  We've said this before.  This whole station is just supposed to be where it is.  It's already written into the company, you know, written into their little major plan that, no,  NEW is supposed to be just where it is.  It's a defensive station.  It's not supposed to go on the offense and do anything.  It's supposed to protect other properties in the market. 
[00:09:30]  That's what it is.  You can't do this because you're going to interfere with this station that's doing well.  Don't do this because you're going to interfere with this show that's doing very well.  Don't do this.  So we sit here, and at some folk of frigging nature, I don't know what happened,  we kind of pulled our heads above the muck and did something.  Right.  You know, to their surprise, I'm sure.  Every time we kind of compete on a music level, no, you can't do that because K-Rock's the music station.  Yeah, don't play those songs.  The Bob Murphy clip and other sports-related things.  We get calls from the fans going, oh, don't play sports clips. 
[00:10:00]  I mean, give me a break.  It's not like we're spending five hours on basketball.  We play a clip because it's funny of Bob Murphy.  Eggman, he's always back.  He is over us.  We got it.  We can't play that anymore.  The fan called up.  Part of the big family of radio that we belong to.  And for some reason, you know, when they could do stuff like that, but the second we kind of chirp up and say something about maybe we're being held back, oh, no, no. 
[00:10:30]  We wouldn't do that.  We're all the same company.  Right.  So it's like we've just been crapped on for quite a while now.  Three years.  And at first, all right, I'll throw them the first year anyway.  Any employer should be able to crap on you the first year.  But then after you prove yourself to a point, you know, they should start throwing you some bones.  Well, the thing that kills me, when we got here, it was a no-brainer to syndicate the show back to Boston. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  That's a huge sticking point.  All the faithful listeners understand at this point.  I mean, when we got fired from Boston, we went out like Dean, like, oh, my God, like James Dean did.  Right.  We were on top of our game.  We were number one by far.  Yeah, we weren't thrown out of Boston because the ratings are bad and no one was there.  We were the talk of the town.  We get fired at the top of our game.  Just all of a sudden, we're just gone.  Gone.  It was such a no-brainer to get a syndicate back to Boston.  But if we go on this station, well, you know, they're a music station, so that's going to really F up, you know, that. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  If you go over to here, well, they play classic rock.  Yeah, it's just there's all problems that no one really wanted to deal with.  And now people are scrambling to try to deal with it now that there's ten days left on our deal.  Ten days left.  Yeah.  The best they can tell us about Boston is they have the right to give us a weekend show in Boston.  But they don't have to. 
[00:12:00]  Weekend.  Yeah.  But they don't have to.  That should have been done day one.  That's after three years.  When we signed on here at NEW, you should have heard, hey, how you doing, Boston and New York.  Day one.  If we're live in afternoons in Boston, we become number one again and make the company an F-load of money.  But for some reason, you know, something's going on that I just don't understand.  Yeah.  Don't get it.  Don't understand.  So we sit here ten days before.  George, what's going on? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, I was calling in just a bunch of chops, but I don't really believe that you're playing the gig.  I was just calling to bust your balls about it.  Hey, George, let me tell you something, because a lot of people are saying that.  Let me tell you, when you know who pulled this little game, it was such a stunt, it's not even funny.  Right.  This is not a stunt, and we will have our say before the week's up.  Dude, I believe you're 100%.  I was just calling to, you know, wrench it a little bit.  But after hearing the spiel, man, you guys are in some serious stuff over there.  They penciled you in to be like losers, so you can't ever get ahead.  I don't think they ever expected us to do well, and we started doing well. 
[00:13:00]  And the company's like, whoa, wow, now what are we going to do?  Well, it's amazing how many people talk about you guys that I, you know, associate with.  And I mean, I go all around the tri-state area doing all kinds of work for different types of people, highfalutin individuals.  You guys got a big buzz.  I can't understand the negativity in the ratings.  I mean, people are not admitting to the fact that they listen to you.  That's the problem.  We've had nothing, and, you know, I'm going to try to, like, talk on a level here so we don't sound like whining and crying.  Dude, you're not, bro.  Because I know you guys, you know. 
[00:13:30]  No, they like the buzzer, Josh, but they really wish you.  This is what I'm trying to say.  In three years here at WNAW, we've gotten nothing but negative energy from the company.  And we did the impossible for them.  We came to New York on a really crappy station and became number one in our day park.  Yeah, no matter how hard they tried to keep you down, you still created a big buzz.  And as far as whatever the hell it is that they use out there.  Whatever it is.  Yeah, all right.  We can't really mention them because I'm...  Oh, sorry, bro.  Yeah, the ratings.  What the hell do I know?  That's cool. 
[00:14:00]  Thanks, George.  Hey, I love you guys, and I love talk radio on your station.  I hope they never change it because that'll really screw up my day.  I enjoy it, and I'm sure thousands and thousands...  You're tuned for standards on WNAW.  Oh, that's ridiculous.  I will definitely go down there and set a little pipe bomb in the studio.  I'm going to blow the whole place up.  All right, George.  Later, bye.  I wouldn't be willing to go out on a limb and say that if we're not with any W any longer,  that they wouldn't continue this.  I think that they'd switch things around and really try to give it a go for a little longer. 
[00:14:30]  But I don't know.  I think you'd be hearing maybe the Rock of New York again or standards or...  What format are you coming for here, Hopi?  This station...  You've been in the business for a while.  Very knowledgeable.  You could be a PD.  No, this station, when we leave, they'll go after Light FM.  You think Light FM?  Light FM has too much of a chunk of the radio pie in this in your town. 
[00:15:00]  Do you think they'd be able to hire a talent such as the likes of Valerie Small Don't  to push the buttons without talking?  It's kind of hard to do.  You know, Rich brings up a very interesting point.  Rich!  How you doing?  What's up, man?  I have a serious question about your contract.  You're talking about all the crap that you're getting from everybody.  I'm just curious why you would even want to re-sign with such a company.  Is it like a security issue?  That's a wonderful question. 
[00:15:30]  All right.  I'll hang up the phone to listen to your answer.  All right.  Thanks, Rich.  How do we explain that one?  What?  Why would we want to?  No.  What could possibly happen?  That we would?  No.  There's so much that could happen.  And one of the things is we could tell the company we don't want to be here anymore,  but they could pretty much force us to stay.  Right.  Absolutely.  That could happen, I guess.  Sure.  They could.  They.  All right.  Yeah, maybe we ought to keep quiet. 
[00:16:00]  All right.  You don't go.  I think.  There are things.  Yeah.  There are just things that could happen.  There are things they could do.  So a legal mumbo jumbo.  To keep us right where we're at.  Yeah.  And then you'd hear a real happy Opian Anthony show.  That'll be the F.U. show for three straight years until we get the point.  We've just been gagged.  We've been crapped on.  We've been told promised things that just never materialized.  And it's ridiculous.  If a show like ours, you know, started getting a buzz back a couple of years back, 
[00:16:30]  we should have just jumped on it with all kinds of ways the station could help us  instead of just leaving us out there to fend for ourselves.  Right.  That's exact.  And I don't care.  You know, they're listening in the back offices.  I know.  But is anything going through your mind back there, hello, that tells you anything different?  Can they come up with anything in their heads that, no, we did this and this and this?  No. 
[00:17:00]  Give us our hours that we come on and do this.  That's it.  I've seen nothing else.  Three years have gone by.  Absolutely no marketing.  None whatsoever.  None.  Zero.  None.  No big promotion for, we're in a, we're in a big ratings period right now.  Yeah.  No big, no big promotion.  Nothing.  And it's not the first big ratings period that we've talked about how we're in a big ratings  period and nothing's gone on.  Nothing.  You know, and we talked about it before.  Hi, listen to me every morning and we're in your free computer. 
[00:17:30]  And here, we got nothing.  You know, we got pull teeth for a DVD player or something.  We've been carrying the station on our back for a really long time and, quite frankly,  the load's getting really heavy.  I feel like, I feel like Sylvester Stallone in Cliffhanger.  I don't know how much longer I can hold on to that.  I know.  To the chick.  Unbelievable.  And I don't mean that chick.  I mean the chick from the movie Cliffhanger.  The movie.  Yep.  So that's where we stand.  We've told you everything. 
[00:18:00]  We don't know and now you don't know.  Just thought it would be nice to let everybody know because it's getting very distracting  around here.  And I think that might be obvious.  And as far as the doubters that think this is some kind of weird, wacky O&A stunt, we  will have our say.  Whether it's on this show, another station, or in the press, we'll tell you everything.  Yeah.  You'll know everything.  I thought the last three years was the FU show. 
[00:18:30]  From Dave.  That's funny.  No promotion.  What the hell do you call those wow window clings?  From John.  A window clink.  You know, I still think about that and laugh.  They ordered thousands upon thousands of wow window clings.  Not stickers that could end up like we've seen them on light posts and bus stops and just  like slapped on signs.  And it's cool.  You drive around and you see like in front of Nobu. 
[00:19:00]  I mean, places are just like 60,000 clings that trucks can't use.  That window clings.  We gave out 60,000.  I've seen two.  Two.  Two.  That's still hanging on to the windows.  Most newer vehicles, especially SUVs, which are all the rage, of course, have those tinted  back windows.  That if you put a cling on the other side, you don't see.  If 60,000 were out there, I've seen two.  I still chuckle when I think about it. 
[00:19:30]  Goddamn Roger.  Godfather.  You know, speaking of the wow stickers.  Yeah.  It takes more than just kind of revolving a whole radio station around wow stickers to  make something happen.  Right.  Right.  Wow.  We're doing another wow sticker stop.  Hey, it's great that, you know, our listeners are getting the wow stickers, but you've got  to do a little more to market the damn place.  Yeah.  Phew.  So that's, you know, that's about it.  It's just been a rough little road here at N.E.W. 
[00:20:00]  And I'm not trying to say this isn't the coolest job in the world.  Of course it is.  I'd rather do radio than anything, especially working for a living, you know?  A lot of people work.  They can't understand, really, how anyone would bitch, and it's not bitching about what we  do.  I love it.  It's the bull crap that keeps it from being fun all the time.  And just wanting to advance our careers a little more and do the best that we can. 
[00:20:30]  It's very frustrating because it was said to you and I by someone, they said, do you  guys realize that you're the talk of the entire industry?  That means, you know, radio guys in Seattle and Phoenix and wherever else.  Everyone knows who you guys are in this industry.  But as far as listeners go, no one knows you outside of New York.  Right.  Yeah.  We haven't been let out of the box.  You know what I mean?  They haven't let us out.  I think they might have been a little fear. 
[00:21:00]  It's wonderful to do that.  They have investments, very large money investments that they have to protect right  now.  They put a lot of money into something.  Let's say you put a lot of money into something and something else you have is a threat to that  something.  Right?  You don't want it out of the box.  That's why you put it on an N.E.W.  That's why you don't syndicate it.  So it doesn't hurt your huge investment.  Well, we're just a little tired of being in the backseat. 
[00:21:30]  That's where we are.  That's about the point we're at, Opie.  No, you don't have to listen to us cry all day.  Yes, we're going to do a show.  What's wrong with you?  I know it's only a couple of people, Opie.  Fine.  But you don't want to know?  Two weeks from today, you tune in and we're not here.  And then you're going to be like, wow, what happened to those guys?  I wish they would have gave us a little clue before it happened.  Right. 
[00:22:00]  We never had a chance to tell the Boston audience.  We were just gone.  Yeah.  Gone.  What happened with Snoring Guy Friday, by the way?  I don't know.  I know.  Oh, you know Stinky?  Stink knows?  I was listening and I'm like, where's Snoring Guy?  Around 9.15, 9.30, I came back here and he was still on the line.  But there was no sound coming out.  So I pick up the phone.  There was not even...  Oh, he must have hung up.  Yeah, but it was still on the hold.  Well, if Snoring Guy's listening, he's the guy that wanted to propose. 
[00:22:30]  To his girlfriend, live on the air.  We'd love to hear from you.  You fell asleep on Friday's show, I guess at about 5 o'clock.  And we picked you up and heard you snoring and sleeping the whole show.  We just kept checking in and you were asleep snoring.  So if you're listening, check in today.  Dumbass.  All right, Anthony, why don't we get the Sopranos thing out of the way next, okay?  Yeah.  We had some great observations about the last episode of the Sopranos.  I thought it blew.  There's a bunch of people saying, hey, it was great. 
[00:23:00]  It was great.  It was one of the...  No, I didn't think so.  Yeah.  Having Uncle Junior sing for the last 20 minutes of the episode.  Ah!  Just killed it.  Talk about...  There's so many things they could have done.  We'll talk about it.  Yeah, 212-757-1027.  A bunch of perverted crackers.  If you don't like it, shoot yourself.  1-7-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.  What does this mean? 
[00:23:30]  Oh, please.  Dr. Kennedy, I love you.  You've cured my ass cancer.  Tony Bacalas.  Pants smell like man-ass.  I've been crapping into the same self-attrition for 18 months. 
[00:24:00]  Pants smell like man-ass.  What the hell was that?  That sock!  George!  Hey, George!  I hate you, please.  Go!  Oh, shut up. 
[00:24:30]  Howdy.  Bang it.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Greg, you've got to listen to this for ten effing minutes.  The whole end of the soprano. 
[00:25:00]  Uncle Junior singing this Dago song.  It sucked.  Vinny's going to tell us why he was singing.  Vinny.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Vinny.  The whole thing we're discussing in school today.  That Uncle Junior's actually singing about next season.  And how someone's going to turn against the family.  And they're going to witness the protection program.  Well, that's what a soprano does. 
[00:25:30]  It sounds like a foreshadowing type of thing.  Alright, Vinny. Thank you.  Alright, later, boys.  Great.  Foreshadowing.  How about now-shadowing?  I haven't seen anything.  Yeah, okay. Jackie Junior got killed.  What did he do?  First of all, that was anti-climatic.  I don't know. It was kind of cool that...  It was kind of cool.  Yeah, but last year with the big pussy.  Yeah.  That was cool.  It was intense.  It was pretty nice.  You know, he didn't even see it coming.  It was like, boom.  But they're dead.  Yeah.  It just seemed like they could have done so much more with his whacking. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  And that was it.  That was it.  We all knew he was going to die.  Yeah.  So, you know, make it interesting.  You know?  It wasn't a surprise.  No.  The big surprise should have been Meadow getting hit by that car at the end of the episode.  Now, I was thinking somebody was going to be splitting the pot.  Of course, we got a pool on who was going to get killed.  Once again, Steve C.  Won.  The ringer for any pool we do here.  He won. 
[00:26:30]  Because he drew Jackie Junior out of the hat.  What up?  It just sucked though.  It was some funny stuff.  I mean, the funeral scene where Paulie Walnuts is bolting across the cemetery to run away  because the feds are there busting him for the gambling.  And then Uncle Junior pulling up a bacala.  You're late.  You told me 4.30.  And then he sees the feds and he jumps in the car.  That was pretty funny.  And the sit down was funny too. 
[00:27:00]  Paulie Walnuts and Ralphie and Tony.  You know what pissed me off about The Sopranos last night?  It's not going to be on the air for what?  Close to a year.  Yeah.  Well, thanks for not solving any plot lines from the season.  I know.  Everything is just hanging.  Jackie Junior obviously solved.  But we went over the whole list of how many story lines they started.  They didn't end any of them.  Nothing.  Nothing.  So we sat there and watched it and nothing happened. 
[00:27:30]  And now we've got to wait a year.  Over a year for the next season.  It just shows HBO is completely stupid because everyone is watching the show at this point.  You've got to turn around and get some episodes out there immediately.  Yeah.  Six months, you know, is not a lot to wait.  No.  Vinny, what's going on?  Hey, how are you doing?  All right.  I know you guys didn't really like the plot, but you've got to admit that was pretty funny  when that Italian guy, when they were having to sit down.  That Italian guy.  Yeah.  I mean, the guy from Italy.  He was like walking with a cane. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, and he fell on ice.  Yeah.  And he was like, he fell right on his face.  I understand there was some comedy in the episode last night, but there was a lot of  unanswered questions that are going to be unanswered for a really long time.  Yeah.  I feel pretty funny.  You know, I don't think they should spend the last 10 minutes plugging Uncle Junior's  CD that he's got coming out.  That was a commercial.  Uncle Junior's got a CD coming out where he sings all those Dago songs.  You know?  Don't spend the last 10 minutes plugging his CD because that's all it was. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  It's one of the songs on, what, Peppers and Eggs?  They could have done something there.  All right.  It looks like Paulie Walnuts is ready to turn.  He's ready to go over to the other family.  Who cares?  We're going to have to wait in here.  I don't know.  John, what's going on?  Let me tell you.  I've been watching these guys from day one.  And last night was the first time ever.  I mean, the whole season I was going along, I thought that, you know, it was all right.  It was going to get better.  It was going to get better. 
[00:29:00]  Right.  And then last night, like you said, there were so many things that could have happened.  And all the papers this morning were saying, oh, well, David Chase is just planting seeds  for next season.  Whatever.  It sucked last night.  And I don't want to wait until next summer for it to come out.  And, you know, there's just so many things that, as soon as it went off last night, I  was just like, that just blew.  I was like, I was screaming at my TV.  I couldn't believe it.  I'm convinced David Chase just doesn't know how to wrap things up.  Well, he doesn't.  And, you know, he keeps talking that he's going to be leaving next year, whatever.  Fine.  He's going to make it suck this much. 
[00:29:30]  Leave then.  Yeah.  You make a good point.  Struggle June to move to Venice and become a gondolier.  I think that's the first thing.  What's with Tony Walnuts?  He's losing his mind.  Well, yeah.  He's had it.  They're all starting with more and more like Grandpa Munster.  He's got that stunk dude going.  He looks like the new Grandpa Munster.  Yeah.  Really?  When they made the Munsters in color.  The new Munster.  A few years back, like five years ago, they tried to redo the series.  Oh, that blew.  It was horrible.  Why bother?  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  Paulie, Paulie.  Well, it's obviously the whole family falling apart around Tony.  We get that.  Yeah.  You think Paulie goes after Tony next year?  Ah, probably.  You know, I'm tired of the speculation.  I'm tired of it.  Like, why even speculate about next season?  They should have tied up a lot more things this season.  Yeah, that's true.  Okay.  See you later.  Thanks.  They're planting seeds for next year, but it wasn't anything where, you know,  you're sitting at home going, oh my God, I can't wait until next year now.  I know.  I can't believe, I don't know what's going to happen.  Yeah, nothing really happened that made me go, oh geez, how am I going to wait? 
[00:30:30]  Nothing spectacular.  Anthony, what's going on?  How you doing guys?  I just wanted to agree with you all that I think the Jackie Jr. killing was like totally,  you know, anticlimactic.  Yeah.  We all knew he was going to die, but it was, you know, maybe if Ralphie was there when  he was going to, you know, when he was going down, you know what I mean?  They could have, yeah.  They could have had Ralphie on the scene or something.  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, something.  I mean, everyone knew that he was going to get killed, you know, just like they just  woke up and shot him in, you know what I mean?  Next scene.  In the back of the head, boom. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Well, I think they wanted to make that scene longer and more involved, but they needed  time at the end.  Whoa!  Yeah, something.  All right.  I think you guys are great, man.  Thanks.  And I mean, as far as like, I just want to say one thing.  I mean, you guys are totally getting like ripped off by like the other shows with their  contacts and stuff.  What?  What?  I mean, you guys were talking about your contacts earlier.  People giving you, you know, crap about, you know, these other people are talking about  it, but.  You know, we'll have our say.  I keep telling you guys that. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, I mean, you guys are great, you know, so.  In the end, we'll have our say and then you tell us if we're like, just throwing a little  bit out there.  Okay?  No, definitely not.  I mean, you guys are, you know, number one right now.  So.  Thank you.  There's a reason why you should, you know, you have to do that.  So.  Thank you.  Take care, guys.  I really have no desire to be censored anymore.  I could throw that on the table.  Right.  No desire.  That's not why I got into radio, you know, a long time ago.  I have people tell us to keep our mouths shut behind the scenes.  Don't like that.  Reed, what's going on?  Hey guys, how you doing?  All right. 
[00:32:00]  I just want to know.  Is this Russian still running around in the New Jersey Pine Barrens for the next year  or what?  Is he ever going to show up?  That was, you know what?  You got to give it to them.  That was a great episode when they're running around the woods like that and they just dropped  that storyline.  Yeah.  Now that was like what?  Two, three weeks ago.  And now I thought I missed the show.  I'm like, wait, where'd this guy go?  He stole the car and now he's gone.  And if you really want to look into that, that was a really big deal.  Right.  They turned on the Russian monsters like that.  Yeah.  So why aren't they walking around scared S-less?  Yeah.  Of retribution? 
[00:32:30]  They haven't even talked about it.  And if he was alive, time has gone by since that happened.  Right.  You know what I mean?  At the time, not just a week or two weeks like in the show time.  They should be looking over their backs.  No one even thought twice about it.  Oh, you know, you try to kill him and most likely he's still alive and he stole your car.  Oh, well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think Tony dropping off any cash back to this Russian guy.  That whole plot line just went away.  Nothing.  Yeah.  Maybe David Chase just like, I don't know.  Gave up.  Had a brain aneurysm halfway through the season. 
[00:33:00]  It really sucked.  More hype than the reality.  Last night's show.  Hassan.  Yes.  What's up?  Not much.  I want to defend it.  I thought it was good.  Okay.  Tell us why.  Because I thought they tied up all the plot lines.  I thought the thing with Jackie Jr. getting killed was perfect.  The fact that it was so quick.  Hassan Chop.  Yeah.  I've heard that all my life.  I love Hassan Chop.  Chop the rabbit.  Chop the rabbit.  It used to be my favorite cartoon.  Now I hate it.  Yeah.  Anyway, I thought the reason why Jackie got killed so quickly, I thought why that was good 
[00:33:30]  is because why should they have a big conversation with him?  It's a personal situation, you know?  Open sarsaparilla.  Open Saskatchewan.  Well, see, there was no surprise that Jackie Jr. was getting killed.  It just seemed like they could have made it a little more dramatic.  I don't know.  I thought it was good.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I thought it was good.  Hassan like.  Hassan like.  You're killing Hassan.  I love that episode.  I don't know.  Alan, what's going on?  I can't be miser.  Listen to me. 
[00:34:00]  The thing with the Sopranos is, is that if you watch what was going on last night,  between Paulie and Ralph, there's going to be a real bad situation next year.  I know.  Ralph got dumped by, Ralph dumped Paulie out completely.  I understand.  I saw all that.  So, the other thing is that, if you remember, Tony said to Ralph, you're giving him a pass.  Mm-hmm.  To Jackie Jr.  Right.  Again, now he's doing the opposite things he's not supposed to be doing. 
[00:34:30]  Mm-hmm.  So, next year's going to really end up being more exciting than this year was.  Great.  By the time it's on HBO, I'm going to forget all about what happened this year.  Now we're just waiting for Oz to start off again.  Oz.  Yeah, there you go.  No S. That's the one to watch.  Someone was just commenting, Oz, man, they kill a major character like every week.  There's something happening.  That show's got action.  Unfortunately, it's got man ass and man junk, but... 
[00:35:00]  All right, Alan.  All those guys are going to new shows.  The killer went to Law & Order Special Victims Unit.  Him and the Nazi, the white racists.  Wait, he's not going to be on it?  Yeah, he'll be there next year, but I'm saying they're all doing ghoul shows now.  Yeah.  Tim Watson never saw Oz.  I'm going to have to pay off this show.  Now you're going to have to watch.  Like, I was totally turned off to watch it because of all the man junk and man ass on the show.  But then they sunk in into the storylines and the violence and stuff. 
[00:35:30]  It was like, oh, God damn Oz is a great show.  You've got to get by all of that to watch the show.  And I saw it from the very first season and it was great.  Well, thank God next week we have back-to-back episodes of Sex and the City.  What a crap show that is.  Please.  What a piece of crap that is.  Yeah, really.  What's to watch that?  Over the hill broads talking about how they want to bang.  That's it.  That's all it's all about.  Sarah Jessica Parker, she's nice with a woman, but she's got a nose you can crack walnuts with. 
[00:36:00]  Old broads need loving, too.  Teen sex in the city.  That's what we need.  All right, Alan, thank you.  You guys suck.  Have a good one.  All right, they do.  They go strutting around and like, Sarah Jessica Parker, I'm sorry, I don't see it.  And the one with the mole on her face?  What, the blonde?  Yeah, the one from Porky's?  Tim Cattrall.  Tim Cattrall?  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe a few years ago, honey.  I'll tell you, I don't know.  I'm not seeing that show.  I'm not feeling it, Opie.  Frank, I ain't feeling it.  Frank, let's go. 
[00:36:30]  You want to defend the Sopranos?  Go ahead.  Yeah, I think last night's show opened up a few things.  I think Polly Walnut talking outside the funeral home with Johnny Sack may lead into him defecting over to their group.  Well, that seemed a little obvious, sure.  But, Frank, what we're trying to say is, okay, they're opening up all these new storylines and stuff.  More storylines that they'll never complete.  Yeah, but that's their job.  They got us all hooked.  Thank God we have our list to look forward to on HBO.  Yes.  That's a great one. 
[00:37:00]  Hey, if you guys need some help with your contract, I can give you a hand.  No, we got so many people involved, it's scary.  Yeah, but this won't cost you nothing.  No, thanks, Frank.  It's a teen sex week, maybe.  Thank you.  That's all I'm trying to say.  There were so many storylines they opened up this season that they just kind of like threw out there.  The rapist.  I know.  That looked like it was supposed to be a big deal.  That would have been good.  We could have seen some violence.  Nothing.  What turned Oz around for you, Anthony?  Luke Perry's junk?  No.  It wasn't Luke Perry's junk on Oz that turned it around. 
[00:37:30]  You douchebag.  He's gonna break up on a wall for a whole season.  Well, we should move on.  That's a good show.  Everyone is talking about the Sopranos today.  Yeah.  It is what it is today.  Leslie!  Hey, how are you?  Good.  I love your show.  Thank you, Leslie.  But I have a bone to pick.  Yeah.  I don't understand how you can say last night's show sucked when that show with them walking  around in New Jersey was so stupid.  Okay.  You didn't like when they were in the woods?  It was insulting.  It was insulting.  Think about it.  If you're walking through the snow, you kill somebody, don't you think you're gonna find 
[00:38:00]  out where that body went?  Yeah.  Okay?  Number one.  Well, they've decided not to tell us what happened with them.  Well, I think because of one of the camera angles that he climbed a goddamn tree where  the footsteps disappeared.  Really?  He climbed up the tree.  He was like a soldier, so he knew what to do.  But the thing is, if he was still alive, wouldn't he have gone, told his boss what happened,  and there would have been some kind of retribution?  Months have passed, you know, show months have passed, so something would have been done, 
[00:38:30]  but no.  They did nothing.  Yeah, but that's a future episode.  I mean, but as the murderer, looking from the point of view of the murderer, if I kill  you, then I gotta know where your body is.  I gotta account for your body.  Number one.  So when are they gonna give us this future episode to wrap that up?  Hang on a second.  Number two.  Point number two.  I rolled down a hill.  I rolled down a hill, my shoe falls off, and I don't go look for it?  That's not even reality.  Yeah, that was a little silly.  I'm gonna walk around all night without shoes?  How stupid is that?  That's stupid. 
[00:39:00]  All right.  Thank you, Leslie.  She did a good job.  I'll give it to her.  One more call here.  Michelle, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I have a good plot.  Love you guys.  I think Meadow is pregnant with Jackie Junior's son.  Yeah, that would make things interesting, wouldn't it?  Didn't they use a ribbon?  Maybe it broke.  Yeah.  Maybe that's why she's sick.  Maybe that's why she was sick.  She wasn't feeling good when she was trying to find where he was.  Right.  And then she had the flu. 
[00:39:30]  Right.  All right.  Thanks, Michelle.  Yep.  Yeah.  Well, with her drinking vodka like she was last night, I don't think that's good for  an unborn child.  Anthony Junior going to military schools.  That was kind of funny.  Yeah.  He comes out with a little uniform.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  All right.  I was just waiting for Tony to smack him in the face, though, and he's mouthing off  to him.  Sucks to be you.  Glenn's pissed because he loves Sex and the City.  Glenn.  Hey, Glenn.  Hey, what's up? 
[00:40:00]  Hey.  Sex and the City?  No good, you say?  If you like Sex and the City and you're a guy, it means you want to have sex with your  mother.  Oh, wow.  She is kind of cute, my mom.  But anyway.  Listen, you'd rather watch that man joke on Oz than Sex and the City?  Well, let me tell you.  Sex and the City revs up all of these mature women for studly sex with me.  You go to all the right clubs.  I'm telling you, all these women get the ideas from Sex and the City.  Well, they all dress like Sarah Jessica Parker.  Yeah.  They're spending money.  They got Benzos, you know, Mercedes. 
[00:40:30]  With a big huge flower on their dressing.  Yeah.  Nice.  Nice look.  They take me to the store.  They buy me all the clothes they think they'd like to see me in.  It's beautiful.  Yeah, that's hot.  I can't wait till it starts coming on.  All these women get that spring fever.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, I want to have sex with sandpaper.  Nice.  Oh, well, you guys are rich.  You know, I'm poor.  Yeah.  He's with the money.  I can't.  You know, I throw a little KY on there.  Blip, blip, blip.  Hi, Glenn.  We're not rich.  I know, fellas.  You know what I'm saying, all right? 
[00:41:00]  All right.  I got to get the Benzos.  Thank you, Glenn.  He loves doing that work.  All right, so good?  Thank God for Queer as Folk on Showtime since we don't have Sopranos anymore, Opie.  Thank God for Queer as Folk.  I feel dirty if I pass by that when it's on Showtime and I'm passing by looking for something.  I'm like, oh, God, why did I see that?  I said, man ass propped up on a couch.  That's what I passed by one time.  I'm like, ah, Jesus Christ.  No, I didn't stay there.  Hey, by the way, someone turned me on to a pretty funny film on ifilm.com. 
[00:41:30]  Thank you.  Oh, the extreme basketball?  Yeah.  Very funny if you want to go through the time of finding it on ifilm.com.  Yeah, it's a total takeoff on XFL.  Right.  Done to basketball.  It's a quest from it, but it's all unedited.  You'll hear all the gritty language.  Yeah.  They did a very good job with that.  Yeah.  212-757-1027.  I think we're done with the Sopranos for now.  And not for a year.  We'll get into some other things next.  Hi, folks.

[00:58:30]  hypocritical the company is yeah we are not allowed to compete in mornings no that is a fact no no not  with this organization that is a fact no will sucks up against us so what's the company gonna do they're  gonna try to get uh someone in that time slot that can compete against us yeah you tell me how that is  fair they're gonna try regardless of if they are all are already uh at that station or see we don't  bring in some new folks we don't care we'll take on all you know competitors but it's just funny how 
[00:59:00]  how it's always you know a one-way street here we're not allowed to compete in mornings to protect  somebody yeah but the company is gonna you know try to put someone in over there that could possibly  compete against us yeah they want to make that move of course they want to try to compete that's  why they're taking will out that's amazing yes amazing don't you think if we would have been able to  do mornings they'd have thrown us in here the mornings uh you know nothing against the sports guys 
[00:59:30]  but the morning is an abomination the rating you know hopefully those guys can do something but  they've got their hands tied behind their back too not allowed not allowed don't talk about it  oscar what's going on hey what's up boys hey hey instead of playing um what celebrities are  listening to us maybe we could play on what radio executives on cbs are listening to us  and see if we get any quotes from that yeah i wonder what cbs executives are listening today

[01:07:00]  gladys yeah there's not a lot of uh mothers out there naming their kids gladys anymore i hear gladys  yeah i know i think mrs kravitz from uh bewitched yes you're right the rag-hag-nag neighbor we all  know how hot and dan dan married gladys his first and third wife so uh so glad what do you got for  the show today the lady in chicago who bit off the guy's testicles yeah this is a cute story  he stuck it in her wrong place and she said no lorraine lorraine bobbit she set a precedent uh 
[01:07:30]  way back get away with it way back in what year was that now well they were married  i know but uh before then you you weren't like you know cutting the guy's thing off  yeah well this is a different case i'll be from what i uh get from this story oh this is the rape  one yeah all right okay i apologize to the ladies out there i mean this girl uh did the right thing  this guy was trying to uh rape her and uh was making her perform a bj you know so she uh she grabbed his 
[01:08:00]  sack his yam bag bites down and bites them both right off  and uh so i guess he just goes running like you know because i know that's what i do and she goes  to the police department in her hand two testes holding the two testes a pair of testes he's at  another hospital uh trying to get the bleeding to stop well what happened with the uh the cops then 
[01:08:30]  called up hospitals and said hey you have a guy there with uh no testes because we have a couple of  testes here so uh lo and behold they find a guy he ends up at a hospital go figure that one out  and uh they bring the testes to the hospital where he is informed op they cannot reattach  his testes oh oh that deserves them right you know don't do the crime if you can't lose your test  what is it what does it look down there like a shopping bag when the you know the bottom breaks 
[01:09:00]  out yeah and you're just left holding the shopping bag when it's all wet you kind of ragged at the  bottom and all your groceries fall out of the bottom yeah that's probably what it looks like god oh god  awful damn because yeah you'd have to take um a majority of the uh the scrope too you know you'd have  to take a big chunk of that so he's now walking around with just a thing with just a peg just this peg  and no yam bag ouch oh yes ouch yeah superfly on the radio that is an awful awful uh story but it's 
[01:09:30]  a good thing it happened to him because that it's a terrible thing he was trying to but you know being  a rapist like that you know if your job is being a rapist the worst thing that can happen is probably  losing your testes or losing your peg serves them right obviously ain't gonna be doing any raping  anymore what was she thinking though like right when she ripped them off and she's got them there  in her mouth huh yeah the collector whoa from outside yeah i mean she's there now holding them in her 
[01:10:00]  mouth like a couple walnuts oh her hand awful good thing though shaking them around that they should  do to rapist let's go to pepe peppy what's up hey how you doing hey yeah it sounds like she studied  at the tobias beecher school of defending yourself from rape remember when he bit the junk off that  guy bit bit of junk off and then did she stand up like he did give a big smile and then just spit it  right out with a big grin on his face did you see this episode of oz anthony oh yeah yeah biggest thing 
[01:10:30]  yeah just bites down you just see him reaching like a woman yeah and then he stands up and spits a  wad of flesh out of it just a wad of meat into the guy's face spits take it easy guy spits his own  junk out at the guy thank you pepe that shows sick all right um anthony we got us we got to get our  next contest going here yeah better complete in the next two weeks uh-oh we want to play uh mommy what

[01:36:00]  all right now i just want to say one thing you guys have i have you you love your job wait wait i  have a feeling you don't want instant tickets anymore no i do this is this i really do all right go ahead  okay let let a rip we'll humor there i just feel that you're in you're in the market that you want  to be in right and um you have a great opportunity you're celebrities you have a great opportunity to  reach people to get your message out there as thick and twisted as it is yes yes and you work for 
[01:36:30]  unfortunately or fortunately a huge organization that has um yeah other people that they're interested  in keeping happy point please that's fine so why should we suffer because of that because you're  in the market where you want to be you have the family that you want to be with and you're doing  what you want to do and what you love to do rachel no it should be thrown on the table as we throw  another piece of the pie out oh another piece little pieces here and there and it'll all add up when  we're allowed to speak our mind finally yeah if we leave here well i don't want you to leave wait wait but 
[01:37:00]  it needs to be said we're not going we're staying in new york okay right we'll still have the market  we'll still have the opportunity uh uh fortunately we wouldn't be gagged anymore there's no there's no  doubt in my mind that uh we'll be continuing our careers in new york and you know what you guys speak  for a lot of people a lot of people would like to have the opportunity to say and do what they want  to do to their bosses so i'm sure a lot of people fully support what you want to do so oh wait till 
[01:37:30]  wait wait till you hear what we have to say wait till you hear three years of pent-up aggression and  crap that we would finally be able to say your heads are going to spin well i'm so interested in that  truthfully i don't really want instinct tickets i understand that we should have that out of  but i just kind of wanted to tell you guys that i support you i i love your show i think it's really  funny and stuff let me let me throw another piece of the pie out there oh i think uh and i being 
[01:38:00]  censored has really really hurt hurt this radio show bingo i have to agree with that well i can't  possibly imagine what other filth could come out of your mouth or what other things that you have to  it's not it's not filth what what we uh what you will hear if anything uh happens over the next 10  days where we are not here anymore what you will hear when we finally are able to open our mouths  is uh revelation people will be stunned and amazed at uh what we would have to tell you i'll give i'll 
[01:38:30]  give a little uh hint here okay uh this is um opie two years ago no about a year and a half ago okay no  a little over a year ago uh a quote from opie but all i wanted was a sandwich  so that's supposed to wet my whistle but all i wanted was a sandwich oh yeah it's supposed to  remember that i do yes well supposedly we had these big plans that uh well i don't want to give too much 
[01:39:00]  away but yeah all i wanted was a sandwich yeah so do you guys have something in the works you will hear  stories of um stories of frustration stories of hypocrisy stories and stories that you wouldn't  actually believe were happening it's amazing and and from the source just wait the latest hypocrisy we 
[01:39:30]  said it earlier um will from k-rock is being fired in two weeks uh the reason is because uh quite frankly  he was i am yeah you are will damn it yeah well you know something i'm not going to stand for this  as a jack i'm not going to go on the air every day and play rack blocks if i know i'm going to be fired  in two weeks okay i am god why doesn't he just do the fu show i'm going to stand up for myself and you  know something i'm not going to come out of one of the retro rock songs into a sleeper i'm going to talk 
[01:40:00]  i'm going to rub it it's got to be said i hear he's a nice guy and all that but the fact is he's  leaving he's uh gonna be gone in two weeks and the reason because um you know he didn't compete too  well uh against ant and i in afternoon drive and now what uh the company's going to do because we're  owned by the same company they're going to put someone in there that they feel could compete with  uh anthony and i yeah now anthony and i have no problem with that and we'll take on all competitors  but it's kind of hypocritical uh from a company standpoint because we're not allowed to 
[01:40:30]  compete in morning drive yeah we are not allowed to uh do mornings a lot of people said oh hey hey  pussy once you go to morning pussy not allowed to not we would love to why do you guys want to go to  the morning then you have to get up so early that's all right why i don't want to i mean i'll do my  drinking in the afternoon with ben really me and ben hammered by noon that's that'll be our new motto  hammered well i'd rather be we'll still be drunk all around here so i'm sure that there are plenty of 
[01:41:00]  other radio stations that are interested in compensating you for your expertise and would  like to feel you away from what hey for anybody who who says why aren't you guys doing mornings  at any w think about it wait hold on think about this it's a no-brainer it is you have you have the  the the flagship show of any station is supposed to be the morning show right so you take the show that 
[01:41:30]  is doing very well on your station and you put it in mornings that is floundering right wouldn't it  be a no-brainer then opie and anthony do mornings at any w sure it's not like it hasn't been discussed  we're not allowed to do mornings at any w we can't right but that's what do you think we did what do you  know the people people out there say oh you don't want to go to mornings because you don't want to  compete all right rachel that is obvious and what i'm trying to explain to you today then you know 
[01:42:00]  then why from a company standpoint uh won't they allow will to just suck at afternoon drive to protect  uh the opian anthony franchise in afternoons not that we would want that but uh you know if we're  talking about you know a larger picture here company standpoint why is it okay one way to protect  one show and not the other way because they're trying to protect and make somebody happy well  whatever why all right that's what it sounds like to me we've given uh too many pieces this time all 
[01:42:30]  many pieces are out there now oh i don't think so it's the same all i'm saying is that you guys  should go do your thing wherever you want to do it and just make sure that you're well compensated for  the ratings and the and the viewers that like you right on viewers all right rachel thank you  listeners whatever yeah i don't have the lingo down pardon me that's okay people still need to know  why uh rick was almost fired rachel thank you all right thank you oh yeah remember that 
[01:43:00]  people need to know why psycho mark was fired oh wait a minute that's right that was a smart move  actually people have to know the fact that he was fired at all  we still stand by the the the whole idea that that guy never should have been fired  said that was a smart move shows on top of its game number one at the time slot ratings to the roof  fire one of the you know one of the components of course that's what you do to the protest of the of  us you know but for some reason that seemed to be a good thing of course 
[01:43:30]  how do we come back around here again how did we do that again we were talking about the swamp now all  i know we're talking about the sludge factory factory now the mommies who hung up ah because  we got to get back to that we're still playing mommy what would you do for in sync tickets god damn it  two one two seven five seven one oh two seven so far we got um that one lady that wants to have  uh her husband or boyfriend eat a hot fart sunday now from the the dupa from the caboose

[02:20:30]  got ridiculous yeah it could have killed somebody in that time yeah that music montage i wasn't too  sure about could have gotten you with some flowers on doing something i don't know  keep it interesting all right tony on line 10 jamie lynn matured into a piece of ass  yeah you look good last night your hair looks good too really i thought it looked like martinia  adams a little bit i like that dude on you they darkened up your eyes a little bit because you're  all sad and crying and stuff you know well thanks guys doing your dramatic crying role well you know we 
[02:21:00]  love you we haven't talked to you in a while yeah i know yeah well i've been on the road we thought you  hated us i don't hate you is your brother still listening to the show a lot yeah i mean he keeps  me posted on you guys yeah cool are you gonna do any movies over the summer uh not over the summer  but next year yeah uh-huh next year you're booked up that far yeah i'm booked till uh next summer  actually well what kind of movie um is it a mob movie no it's not are you steering clear of that what are  you steering clear of that so i'm not even italian so i mean it's not it's kind of pointless to 
[02:21:30]  side chatting you're like yeah but you're kind of looking yeah well i've been recording an album  oh really yeah because oh let me say no it's not like well it's real latin because i'm cuban  right oh so so you're gonna um okay that's still a little different yeah so i've been doing back  and down september ish you're not doing like a pop album it's not very no it's more like rmd latin  kind of than pop it's not cheesy video what you're gonna do a video gonna do the whole work though 
[02:22:00]  yeah what are you wearing in the video i don't know i didn't do it yet is it going to be skimpy  though um i think i'm going to be more yeah of course nice like right oh nice very nice hey what  happened to adrianna and that uh that lesbian tennis instructor from earlier on in the season  they just dropped that i know anything that got dropped this year i can assure you will get brought  up next year but but it's jamie it's getting confusing another we went we had a whole list of uh  storylines that were dropped from the sopranos we did this last week there was over 30 of them 
[02:22:30]  are you serious yeah like the russian mob guy that'll come back oh but all right here's our  theory on that that happened a couple weeks ago uh in showtime it's probably a couple months ago and  and and no one's looking over their back yeah and and and if he was alive he would have gone to the  boss already and said something and some kind of uh you know repercussions would have happened  yeah well i don't ask questions ah very good don't ask questions oh but i have something to tell you  guys uh-oh what i'm gonna be in the cover of maximum in december hey okay hold on we love maximum and 
[02:23:00]  you know why because they put you little starlets and little skimpy outfits they do what were you  wearing did you do the photo shoot already what were you wearing what are you wearing i don't want to  tell you gotta come on i don't think i'm allowed were you wearing some of those flower pasty  just flowers no more than flowers but more than flowers but and they had you in some kind of  provocative poses or something of course belly showing belly showing are you happy with the 
[02:23:30]  shots uh i haven't seen them yet short skirts i did say that like last week thong panties  what short skirts thong panties type thing where you're leaning against something with your  ass all that fun stuff hey hey uh jamie we got big news too we're in this uh month's issue of  brill's content are you really i gotta get me a copy of that i'm wearing a little little belly  shirt yeah i love it yeah they got me in a little skirt and i'm wearing a thong and i'm leaning against  something right very cool that's good for you guys that's impressive right very and we're going to be

[02:24:30]  he was a kid you've exploded and we can't hang with you anymore you're like i'm not i'm the same  girl you're out of our league oh i'm the same girl you got a boyfriend no no no no any no prospects  or nothing no i can't say oh oh yeah are you going out with paulie walnuts  he's a business hey i got one more question about the sopranos okay go ahead another storyline  that was dropped this uh year your psycho roommate she'll be back yeah but all of a sudden she was just 
[02:25:00]  gone look like she was going to stab you while you were sleeping i like her i love her she looked  like a great girl she's so fun yeah she looks easy no she's not any girl she's smart no any chick that  drinks that much and pulls their own hair out that's easy we're talking about like the the character  we talk about characters right not the real person because we don't we don't know the real person of  course like when i say jackie jr is an a-hole you know i'm just saying yeah i don't know him from 
[02:25:30]  a hole in the wall he was supposed to be on our show i don't know what happened with that he's a  real nice guy yeah we'd love to have him if you if you're you know i'll talk to him i might see him  later oh oh oh oh really oh what do you mean by that with his girlfriend uh-huh oh that's kinky but i  like it all right jamie you're going to come in here someday again sure i'm back well i'm going to  vegas for a little while and then i'm back on the road so yeah vegas yeah we get a little vacation  you know i don't want to bore everyone but there's so many people calling in just to say 
[02:26:00]  how great you were in cinderella so oh well thanks so much it's i mean the same mean they're kind of  different lights so yeah you're a little sweeter than that right yeah all right all the girls are  calling up to say that and there's one guy and i'm sure he's gay yeah well thanks well i i like the  gays too so well so do we james i know i'm just saying not many straight guys are probably like  at the top of their list well how does the parents came and they're all straight well well we heard 
[02:26:30]  we've heard rumors about uncle jr you know oh no no that made that that was printed yeah that was  printed is that any truth to that that uh that he's gay that he's gay in real life  no he's married that's how i got the cancer tony dr kennedy had to cure me because i got the  cancer cancer from gay love oh whatever no way no huh no i thought it was you're hearing it here  first okay yeah i'm telling you now now i like dr kennedy's prostate exams tony that helped me get 
[02:27:00]  through the chemo i must have missed that episode it would have been a great episode about a rewrite  without me that would have been much better than seeing him sing for the last ten minutes  i get a big smile on my face when i hear dr kennedy's gloves snap on i know fun's coming  fun's coming dr kennedy i didn't get that script i like jamie she's awesome you're all right yeah  yeah what up oh thanks guys uh one final question yosh wants to know if you're going to be nude on 
[02:27:30]  the sopranos next year you will not see me doing any nudity now no nude scene you know what kind of  something i'm comfortable with you know what kind of creeped us out because we feel like we know you're  just a tiny bit because you've been in here and hanging and stuff when jackie jr took that peak when you  like uh passed out oh we felt like we were your big brothers or something like oh that's disgusting  watching in and it's like oh okay get off of her he was actually really uncomfortable doing that i'm  sure yeah because his pants got tighter that's why he was uncomfortable what'd you say no he's just 
[02:28:00]  uncomfortable because his pants got tighter yeah that was just i don't know about that took a little  peak oh why are you saying he's gay no no we've been nothing but uh gentlemen believe me we have  no credibility here right no matter what we say everyone thinks it's a lie yeah of course like  face sex yeah yeah like the post right yeah all right jamie all right take care guys thank you so  much for calling us today you're welcome i'll come in when i'm back in new york we love that all right 
[02:28:30]  all right bye there she goes metal soprano jamie lynn yeah she's always been uh cool a long island  girl yeah cuban huh doing very very well yeah i didn't know that i thought she was a jew is she  cuban jew because you could be jewish and be something else i love when they say that well what nationality  are you i jewish no that's not your nationality it's like no but but it is i think to answer your  question she is jewish and she's also uh part greek i hear ah oh greek that's nice cuban nice cuban 
[02:29:00]  because hispanic opening you know what you just said about that before hispanics are sex monkeys sex  monkeys i learned that today i've never met a hispanic peru she seems a little you know i don't know what  she's like if you get it no i'm just saying you know and we don't not we don't have many female  celebrity friends of the show that's why i did not call her a prude all right just be quiet zip zip 
[02:29:30]  i'm just saying zip all we have doesn't seem very um at least the way she puts herself across she  doesn't seem very sexually outgoing now that could be totally different in the sack yeah no i think she's  cool you think she goes well yeah yeah it's gotta be the right guy right right right nice right be  nice man which way i want her to be a friend of the show we don't really like that all we had is  kimmy on the female front and you could just think of her like in any deviant sexual position with 
[02:30:00]  multiple partners the whole deal with kimmy but jamie lynn's like you know she's just coming into her  own she seems a little more choosy i don't know maybe i'm wrong holy ass uh john from cedar grove  a cuban jew greek yes a whining hot sex monkey who likes it in the oh god stop it come on john stop it 
[02:30:30]  i like to think of jamie like uh sweet and innocent anthony yeah jamie lynn sweet and innocent like  everyone's little sister right she could be your little sister the opposite of kimmy you're like  part of the uh you're like part of the soprano family right so i feel sure and i feel like she  is the young sister the young sister that we all just want to sleep with she's gonna be in the  september issue of maxim on the cover that's huge that's very cool yeah all right two one two seven

[02:53:00]  off like uh one of those steering wheel locks no how dare i we learned a lot auto lock it's an  anti-theft device that locks onto your brake not your steering wheel a thief can cut through your  steering wheel in about 10 seconds a thief never able to cut through your brake it makes your car  worthless so how the hell are you going to drive without a brake pedal auto lock installs in seconds  two simple moves and your brake pedal's locked and your car's undrivable we we got to tell the  fine folks that um they took a what a hacksaw yeah and went through an ordinary um steering wheel in 
[02:53:30]  less than 15 seconds right in front of us the guy is sawing in the conference room upstairs sawing  through a uh a steering wheel at which one i grabbed the hacksaw and started sawing through my neck to try  to get my head off my shoulder because i couldn't believe i'm watching the guy sawing through a  steering wheel but he did prove a point he proved that uh the steering wheels yeah there's a lot of  foam and not much metal yeah they're easy to go through yeah don't waste time with the other uh
