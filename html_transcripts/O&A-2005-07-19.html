<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly between segments.  The show opened with a discussion about a female teacher's sexual relationship with a minor student, focusing on the perceived double standard compared to male teachers in similar situations, and the hosts' commentary on her attractiveness. This transitioned into complaints about the failing "Jack FM" radio format, the lack of celebrity guests on their own show despite its popularity, and frustrations with their booking agent.  Several callers phoned in: one recounted a negative experience with a doctorâ€™s office, prompting a discussion about medical arrogance; another detailed a military experience involving frostbite and the need for improvised "cock socks"; and a caller named Dave sang a song with altered lyrics.  Jimmy, celebrating his birthday, discussed attending OzFest, his impending departure from the show being a recurring theme throughout the broadcast.  Laszlo, a show regular, was mentioned as a future guest, with some of his bits played.  The hosts repeatedly, and unsuccessfully, attempted to "hijack" celebrity guests from other radio stations.  Online content, including videos of a mother yelling at her child and a show staffer's "assault on the media," was also briefly mentioned.

The show continued with more attempts to secure celebrity guests, prompting listeners to call in if their local morning shows had any.  This led to a discussion about the evolution of reality TV (*The Real World*, *Survivor*, *Big Brother*), interspersed with insults directed at Eric, a regular contributor, regarding his clothing.  A listener called in about Norton being a guest on a Cleveland radio show, leading to another attempt at a "celebrity hijacking."  A significant portion compared the original and edited TBS versions of *Fast Times at Ridgemont High*, highlighting the extensive censorship.  The hosts then interviewed the "Penis Puppeteers," a performance art group, in an explicit interview about their act.  Further attempts at guest hijacking, discussion of Jimmy Norton's birthday and frustration with the lack of guests, and reflections on the death of General William Westmoreland and the passage of time, all punctuated this section.  The show included playing music from an Australian AC/DC tribute band and more listener calls.

Another segment included news items such as the discovery of a small alligator in Long Island, new albums from the Rolling Stones and New York Dolls, a new Stained single, a Foo Fighters/Weezer tour, the death of a leather-clad individual from AIDS, the box office success of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," the Yankees' lead in the standings, Larry Brown's dismissal as Pistons coach, Kenny Rogers' arrest, and Pam Anderson and Tommy Lee's impending remarriage.  A highly profane audio clip of a mother yelling at her son ("pet battle") was played, followed by discussions of their disappointment with several comedians (Carlos Mencia, Louis Black, Colin Quinn, Carl Schmitz, and Dice) who hadn't appeared on their show despite being considered friends, contrasting this with Jay Moore's loyalty. A substantial segment was dedicated to listener-submitted and news reports about bestiality, including graphic details.  A credit card warning was given, with one host revealing a $10,000 monthly spending habit.  An upcoming "Bombs and Flubs" segment was teased.

A segment focused on the extended playing of the aforementioned audio of a mother's furious tirade at her son.  The hosts, Steve (in studio), and callers speculated about the family dynamics and shared personal anecdotes about parental discipline, including physical punishments, with Anthony recounting an incident involving his penis being accidentally struck by a strap. Callers shared similar stories, and one detailed his drastic method of disciplining his son.

The show concluded with Opie recounting childhood frustrations with vacuum cleaners, which led to a discussion about Acura Integra thefts.  They discussed rising minimum credit card payments and Opie's past debt.  Audio of Boston Mayor Thomas Menino's incoherent speech was played, followed by a "what did you learn" segment with callers, including Dean from Tom's River who detailed his independent promotional efforts in Times Square, leading to a discussion about the show's lack of network promotion and a proposed "Opie and Anthony Earth Day" littering event.  The show ended with continued banter among the hosts.

[00:06:30]  In the world.  Well, I guess satellite radio company in the world.  In the galaxy.  Can I be turned up just a little bit?  No.  Everyone's loud in my headphones except me.  No.  No.  You stay right there.  Thank you.  But I got you at minus 10 dB.  Minus 10 dB today?  I think.  That's where you were.  It's one more louder.  Oh, now I got you at minus 6.  See, all our settings go to 11.  Right across the board.  11, 11, 11. 
[00:07:00]  We gotta go.  Just make 10 louder.  Make 10 the loudest.  We gotta go right to Alabama, Anthony.  Alabama male.  Sean.  How you doing, fellas?  What up, Sean?  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  Happy birthday.  Oh, thank you.  Aw!  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday to you.  That's all you got.  Thanks, guys.  That's all we have this morning for you.  I wasn't even thinking about my birthday.  Sure you were.  But you're going to OzFest today, right?  In Philly?  Birthday boy is heading to Philly. 
[00:07:30]  Excited.  Yeah.  Going to Philly for OzFest?  And you're going to be interviewing some bands and stuff, right?  No, me and Steve are doing that in the Jersey OzFest.  I just, you know, I'm going because I want to try to meet a couple of people, but I don't trust anything until it happens.  Right, right.  Don't jinx it.  You just go in there to enjoy the show, and if anything happens when you meet people, you meet them, and that'll be cool.  Oh, no, today I'm going to meet.  Oh, you are?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to have to shit all the way to Philly.  I'm very OzFest.  I have to shit at least once. 
[00:08:00]  Really?  All nervous?  Yeah, it's awful.  No, I just might, around, you know, noon or one o'clock, my colon just starts acting up.  I have to squat and pray I don't fall backwards to a pile of drunken awfulness.  All right.  Well, happy birthday to little Jimmy North.  Yes.  Thank you.  Jimmy was pointing out something today.  Oh.  We get this O&A daily prep sheet every day.  Yes.  It's like a little newsletter almost.  And, you know, I'll start with this.  The top daily headlines, you know, some hot topics we want to maybe touch on today. 
[00:08:30]  Jack FM does poorly in ratings here in New York City.  Yeah.  Big radio story in New York.  Bunch of dopes, our old company.  They got oldies off the air.  Yep.  This oldie station that was in New York City for, I don't know, 50 years.  CBS FM.  Something like that.  And it was doing okay, actually.  Yeah, no problem.  It was doing okay.  It was doing like a 3.8, 3.7, 3.6, right around there. 
[00:09:00]  Not bad.  Which isn't bad as far as ratings in New York City go, right?  Mm-hmm.  And then they get this jack format, which is, it's supposed to be like that whole iPod thing.  We play what we want, man.  Except, see, the problem is when you do have an iPod, you program the iPod with the songs you want to hear.  You want to hear.  So you're guaranteed to like what's on your iPod.  Other people don't program your iPod.  But some dope out there decide, well, let's take the iPod mentality.  We'll make a radio station.  Put commercials. 
[00:09:30]  It's like an iPod with hundreds of commercials.  And a lot of songs that I wouldn't put on my iPod.  Yeah, it sounds like your iPod.  Sounds like it should work, right?  Sure.  Ugh.  Well, the station went from like a 3.8, I think.  Yeah.  To a 1.9.  Ouch.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  And I guess this jack format.  Where it takes for nothing.  You might have one in your city.  It is in deep trouble.  Really?  It's not taking off anywhere right here. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, it's failing all over.  That's what Ben said.  Doug.  The country.  Doug, the Ben format's doing better, Doug.  Let's go to Colorado.  Matter of fact, we've got some info on this.  Eric, go ahead.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hello.  Hey, the Jack FM station here that was here in Colorado, I think, was one of the first  ones in the nation.  They went off the air here within the last few weeks.  And the station went back to its old format.  Yeah, that's what's going to end up happening.  But now, they lost all their oldies, Jack.  So, now they're in deep trouble.  Well, that's just it. 
[00:10:30]  Unfortunately, and let me say, I am so grateful to have my truck back today because yesterday  I was without my XM and I missed out on my virus.  Oh, my God.  You missed the big announcement yesterday.  See?  I didn't even get to hear any replays.  A freaking huge announcement for the show yesterday and you missed it because you didn't  have your truck.  Yeah.  I'll have to catch the replay.  But.  All right.  I was forced to listen to this.  I was flipping around through the dials and that's when I found this one station that  used to be Jack and I heard their old call letters were back. 
[00:11:00]  And the DJs that were on there were horrible.  I even sent them an email last night and told them, thank God I have XM because your DJs suck  but your music was good.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  Having instant feedback here from Elo Henchman in Washington.  Opie, remember, oldies are alive and well on XM Satellite Radio.  One of Elo's henchmen.  I'm going to be a henchman.  Very good.  And then some of the other things on the daily headlines of our prep sheet, you know, Steve 
[00:11:30]  reminds us that there's some great stuff on his website, foundrymusic.com and opiananthony.com.  We have a video of a mom yelling at her son.  We're going to get to that audio very soon.  We were laughing at this in the office.  I love it.  Just a lunatic mom yelling at her kid.  We also have our new creation, Andrew, reading the news and singing karaoke.  The video is now up on opiananthony.com.  Very good.  And Clayton's assault on the media.  One of our own hit the Today Show yesterday morning with the Opie and Anthony sign. 
[00:12:00]  And his video and pictures are up on opiananthony.com as well.  That was a good one.  And it just kept popping up behind Matt and Katie on the morning show over there.  And it was very visible.  Very good job from Clayton.  And the assault on the media contest continues.  For the month of July, a My Fire is up for grabs and a day in the studio with the gang.  Okay?  And that guy Steve from Boston is officially in the lead.  So you've got to beat out Steve's assault on the media if you want to be crowned the champion  for the month of July.  Okay?  All right.  And finally, a dozen new bosom picks on ratemywow.com. 
[00:12:30]  Brand new Rate My Wow pictures.  Yes, that's another website that Steve is whoring.  Nice.  It's ratemywow.com to see some fine topless babes.  And then other things in the top daily headlines, Anthony.  Small alligator found on Long Island.  Wow.  Who cares?  That, I think, is called filler. 
[00:13:00]  I think that's page filler for this top daily headlines.  This is called, let's make the font larger.  Yeah.  Let's make it legible for an 80-year-old woman.  This is awful.  NASA says launch will be postponed again.  Okay, we all know that, right?  Yeah.  Until what, September?  At least.  Hot teacher that abused students says she's nuts.  She is so goddamn hot.  Have you seen the picture in the paper?  No.  Oh, is it the Daily News?  It's one of them.  Or is it the post? 
[00:13:30]  Oh, this is the teacher, the hot blonde that was banging one of the students.  Banging her 14-year-old student.  I think it was some, what you call, colored kid.  She was banging him.  I think that's in the other one.  It's in the post, isn't it?  It's in the post.  Did you see this hot picture on page six?  Oh, my God.  I didn't know they could show this kind of stuff.  What?  The seal of Heidi Klum.  Oh.  Wow.  Jeez. 
[00:14:00]  What a lot of...  You can't find it in it.  No, I stink.  Oh, well.  It's such a good picture.  Where did it go?  It just disappeared.  I think we ripped it.  Oh, there it is.  There it is.  I found it.  Look at her.  There it is.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  It kind of looks like Jessica Simpson.  Wow, what a body.  And she was banging...  Imagine you're 14.  That's your teacher.  And she wants to make sucky sucky on you.  That's how it started.  Who ratted her out?  The friend.  What is wrong with a friend? 
[00:14:30]  She was having sex with the kid when one of the kid's friends was in the car.  Oh, that's right.  And, you know, I'd rat him out, too.  I'd be pissed.  Be like, hey, bring a little over here, lady.  Why would she do that?  That is kind of crazy.  She says she's insane.  She must be.  She's copping an insanity plea.  And her lawyer is saying she's insane.  Please don't send her to prison.  They will tear her apart.  The lawyer is saying this.  It'll be like throwing fresh meat to lions. 
[00:15:00]  And that's really hot to think about, too.  Throwing her in a female prison.  Wow, you're right, Anthony.  It says to place an attractive young woman in that kind of hellhole is like putting a piece of raw meat in with the lions.  Yeah.  I'm not sure she would survive.  Woo, she wouldn't.  But videotape it.  Make it a reality show, please.  The boy told investigators he and the teacher had sex in the classroom, her house, and once in a vehicle while his 15-year-old cousin drove.  Cousin, that was it.  So the cousin was a rat at her mouth?  Scumbag.  Fucking rat.  Whole family of rats. 
[00:15:30]  What an idiot.  That's totally a double standard.  Yeah.  You know, you got a guy teacher banging a 14-year-old girl.  Everyone is outraged and up in arms.  What's going on?  She's on TV.  She's on TV?  The crazy guy.  Oh, there she is.  All right, hold on a minute.  Let's see if we get anything.  LaFave faces charges of lewd and lascivious battery, a felony.  Attorney John Fitzgibbon says plea negotiations with prosecutors broke down because of their demand that LaFave serve significant prison time. 
[00:16:00]  To place an attractive young woman in that kind of hellhole is like putting a piece of raw meat in with the lions.  I'm not sure that Debbie would be able to survive.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Certainly is.  Before the trial, prosecutors say a state psychologist has already concluded she was not insane.  But another hired by the defense found she was indeed...  She's a model.  She's a fucking model. 
[00:16:30]  That's a wedding video.  ...who divorced her after the arrest, says he believes she knew right from wrong, was not insane, and should serve jail time.  She committed a crime, and call her what you want to, a child molester, but she did commit a crime, and she probably deserves...  She's not a child molester.  That's the former husband, by the way.  She's a good egg.  Really?  LaFave also faces yet another trial in nearby Marion County for an alleged sexual encounter in a van with the same...  She looks like Christina Applegate, right?  A little bit. 
[00:17:00]  A little bit, a little bit.  All right, there you go.  She's a model.  Yeah, and she's getting...  She's a friggin' model.  She's not the one who was banging the young black student, right?  Yeah.  That's right?  She was a black kid.  Oh, was she?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She, uh...  A little jungle fever.  She got all dollied up for court, too, you notice that?  All gussied up, Opie.  She's hot, man.  All gussied up.  Don't you think she should have, like, dressed down a little bit for a court appearance?  Do you blame her husband, though, this hot piece of ass?  Everyone's knowing she banged a young student.  I mean, that's humiliating.  Oh, it's so humiliating.  And they showed the wedding video. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  And they're face-to-face on the dance floor with, like, your once, twice, three times  a lady playing in the background, nose-to-nose, a little love in the air.  And, uh, fast forward, not too long, either, after they were married, and she's, uh, banging  one of her students.  Why do you do that with the cousin in the vet?  What's wrong with you?  How stupid are you?  She was all sexed up.  Yeah, she was smart.  She could have gotten young tail for years to come.  She needed it.  Had to have it.  God, that stupid cock-blocker cousin.  She was, uh, she was wanting.  You know how pissed you'd be at your cousin? 
[00:18:00]  What a good thing you got as a kid.  That is like gold.  Oh, please!  That's like your Playboy coming to life.  Finding, yeah.  Finding a stack of Playboy magazines and having him come to life.  Yeah, it's just like, you know, having sex with your pillow.  What is wrong with this cousin?  You know what he's gonna have to go through in life to get a piece of ass like that now  on his own, without her being a nut and, you know, sexually abusing him, pretty  much?  Right.  You know what he's gonna have to go through?  With all the awkward, stupid, trying to date at school and picking up, like, rags and... 
[00:18:30]  Oh!  He goes from a Playboy model to now he's gonna have to start dating girls with pimples and  braces and...  Oh, and parents and...  And bad Britney Spears freaking attire.  Stupid adolescent girl headcase problems and...  Probably has, like, a retainer that has, like, the strap that has to wrap around her neck.  And think how long it takes.  You sit there, he's banging that ten, and now he's gotta, like, settle for, on a good  night, dry humping on the basement couch. 
[00:19:00]  Right.  Going home with blue balls.  Yeah, that...  Because she doesn't want to do it.  Meanwhile, this one's just zipping him down and sucking it right there in the van.  God, I would kill my cousin.  He would have to die.  Why would you admit it, though?  Why would he admit it to police when they asked him?  Why would he just go...  Ah, please, the cops.  They're gonna go, no, okay, go home.  They knew.  And then they just keep on ya.  Cops are ruthless, man.  Yeah.  That shouldn't turn me on, but, man, it does.  Of course.  It turns on every guy out there.  It's not as creepy that way. 
[00:19:30]  The other way, it's really creepy.  Yeah.  I'm thinking about, like, how hot it would be to have, like, a young male student.  It's such a double standard, though.  I mean, you get a teacher banging a 14-year-old girl.  Everyone's like, that is fucking sick.  But a hot, you know, blonde teacher like this banging a 15-year-old boy, you know?  Yeah.  I say, what's wrong with that?  Because I know where my hormones were at at that age.  It was your fantasy.  It was every guy's fantasy growing up.  Look what happened with the other case.  The guy that was screwing his... 
[00:20:00]  I guess it was a teacher.  Got her pregnant.  She went to jail.  Well, now she gets out.  They're together.  They got married.  Have kids now.  Everything's fine.  Hunky-dory.  You never see that happen when it's the other way, either.  The girl, you know, guy gets out of prison, and the girl, hey, how you doing?  Let's get married.  Right.  Well, that's one of the bigger stories today.  But anyway, Jimmy was pointing out something else, though.  We went off on another tangent here.  Was it the fact that on this page here, I was looking around, and I see this... 
[00:20:30]  I had, like, a lot of scratch paper room to write down some ideas.  Yeah, there's plenty of room.  To jot down an idea.  And I realized that under guests, there's, let me see, one, two, three, four, five, six,  seven, eight blank lines.  Eight blank lines in a box that only contains eight lines, by the way.  Yeah.  So it's good.  It's action-packed for the guests.  We don't have...  Yeah.  That box labeled guests is just empty. 
[00:21:00]  I was psyched yesterday when I came in, and at least, you know, I said Frenchie in studio.  Frenchie.  At least today you got somebody, you know, and tomorrow, I believe, Laszlo.  I mean, I don't want to blow the surprise.  Oh, you blew the surprise now.  Dude, I was talking to Elo last night.  Do you realize that XM is just blowing up, and we can't get guests on this program?  It's just amazing.  Is there any explanation as to why?  Uh, no.  I didn't really go down that road with him, I guess.  I think it has to do with our reputation sucks on ice. 
[00:21:30]  It is really bad, and nothing is really being done to remedy that.  Yeah.  Like, people aren't getting together with these people and going, no, you know, I don't even  know how to remedy it.  How do you remedy a bad rep?  You know what, though?  We're paying the booker a lot of money to book guests for this show, and day in and day  out, there's no guest booked for this show.  There's a major problem.  So, if we have a bad reputation, then they've got to work a little harder.  I mean, we have a lot of great interviews with huge celebrities where nothing went wrong. 
[00:22:00]  Talk to some of the celebrities we've interviewed.  We've interviewed LeBeau from Hogan's Heroes.  Perhaps that wasn't a good example.  Let's just not talk about that one.  That was a fine headline for the Oapster back in the day.  Good one, Oap.  Uh, Travis Tritt, Ozzy, you get the, you know, excerpts from those interviews.  Mm-hmm.  Big stars, and there was no problems whatsoever.  I didn't want to hear that shit.  You've got to work harder.  That's all.  There's other radio shows.  People don't want to work in this day and age. 
[00:22:30]  No matter what you do, people just don't want to work.  They want to pass the buck, hang out, you know, download tunes on their iPod during work  time.  You're talking about me?  Oh.  You just described me to a T.  I don't want to work either.  I know.  I would be the biggest hypocrite if I unloaded on anybody.  Well, what guests did Ben offer us today, in all fairness?  Who?  Ben.  Today?  Yeah.  Um...  Because we're always saying no to guests, but the problem is the people they do bring 
[00:23:00]  to the table are just awful.  Yeah.  Absolutely awful.  And the ones we say yes to, we don't get.  Right.  Like Steve Buscemi.  Or Billy Bob Thornton.  And it's not even the reputation.  You know what?  I agree.  But it's also like, part of it is other shows tear guests apart when they come in.  And they go, believe me, they go on a Howard or other shows, they know that they're occasionally  getting their assholes ripped out.  Yeah.  They go.  Yeah, they go.  You're right.  It's also got to be difficult when the company isn't kind of pushing, going, look, this is  a show we want you to do.  This is a high profile show for us.  If the company's going, eh, whatever, don't do it. 
[00:23:30]  Well, then why should a publicist take it seriously?  Believe me, it's a bunch of different reasons.  Well, we obviously have a major problem.  We've got to try to figure out a solution to that.  Because we're a big national talk show now.  A big one.  I guarantee there is local radio out there right now, broadcasting.  It's morning radio.  There's morning shows all over the country doing, I was going to say exactly what we're  doing, but slow down.  Slow the fuck down.  But I bet you one thing, I bet you they have guests on their shows today. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, every radio show has guests.  They all get guests all over the country.  It doesn't matter if they're in, like, bumfuck Iowa.  We are heard, obviously, from New York to L.A., everywhere in between, up into Canada.  It's been stupid Canada, right.  And then on the internet, we're all over the world.  And then there's this, probably a little morning show in the middle of Idaho, that probably  has, like, Louis Anderson on today. 
[00:24:30]  Hi.  You know?  Yeah, my drunken father used to hit me with whiskey bottles, but I turned that into comedy.  Oh, what a depressing fat oaf.  Maybe the guest thing isn't a good idea if we're going to have the likes of him.  Yeah, it was tragic.  My enabling mother would just feed me food until I exploded.  My father would just demean me and beat me with whiskey bottles.  But I turned that all around as I grew up and turned it all into just hysterical comedy. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Worked well.  Take another cock up your ass.  There is nothing funny about that guy when he comes on.  It's just a pathetic mess when he hits the TV screen.  You watch, and I go, oh, God, this guy's pathetic.  I'm laughing.  What's his joke about if he doesn't sweat, he'll explode or something?  Because he wipes his sweat off with a little sweat rag. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Like, excuse me for doing this.  If I didn't sweat, I'd explode.  He's the first one I saw do that microphone stand joke.  A lot of guys have stolen that from him where he moves his microphone.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he goes, let me move this so you can see me.  So you can see me.  Yeah, I'm laughing on the outside, but inside I'm weeping about that joke because it's so ironic  that I'm a big fatty.  Anyway.  Yeah, I bet you there's people riding around listening to Morning Radio that does have guests on.  Well, that's what we do today. 
[00:26:00]  No guests.  We're guestless again.  How about tomorrow?  Tomorrow, um...  What do we got tomorrow?  Well...  Let's promo it.  Laszlo.  All right.  We like Laszlo.  We do like Laszlo.  Sure.  But no offense...  But as far as a guest goes, you know...  No offense, though.  That's not going to get the job done.  No.  He gives us great radio.  Yeah.  I really like when Laszlo comes in.  Laszlo knows the deal.  He's not a big guest if I can pick him up and bring him here.  There you go.  See?  I'm friends with Laszlo.  It doesn't count.  Yeah.  I'm friends with Billy Burrow and Bobby. 
[00:26:30]  Those guys don't count.  Mm-hmm.  No.  They don't count as guests.  They're friends.  They're friends.  They're featured guests.  They're dummies we hang out with.  Did I mess up something here?  Dummies.  Dave in Jersey.  What's up?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Dave.  Good morning, Earl Jerry.  Thanks, Dave.  Oh, just to give you a quick thing.  I know you guys have where you have listeners listen in to all the local stations.  Yeah.  And once in a while, we pick on everybody else.  Right.  Shut up, man. 
[00:27:00]  You shut up.  What's wrong with your voice?  Oh, you're going this way.  What's wrong with it?  Shut up, man, man, man, man.  Anyways, I was thinking of everybody.  Repeat after me.  Pork chops and applesauce.  What happened to your voice, dude?  I have no idea.  I get picked on all the time.  Did you ever reach puberty?  I'm still working on it.  How old are you?  Do you have a hair on your sack?  I doubt it. 
[00:27:30]  Are you hairless?  Time to change.  Yeah, no old Jimmy would like it.  How old are you?  23.  Oh, shit.  Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Sha-na-na-na-na-na.  Ha-ha.  Sha-na-na-na-na-na.  Ha-ha.  Hey, this is your tune, dude.  All right.  Listen to the words.  They make such sense.  Autumn turns to winter.  See, things change.  And then winter turns to spring.  Oh.  It's not just season, you know, it goes for everything. 
[00:28:00]  Clouds can turn to rain, and then it just might snow.  You gotta take a lesson from Mother Nature, and if you do, you'll know.  You're a rich man, such a...  You're a filthy idiot.  To change.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:28:30]  Okay.  Summer turns to winter.  Sometimes a heavy, healthy man will turn into a bag of bones.  Oh.  The changes you've been through.  Right.  The changes you've been through.  Dad was in his suit, but now he's in a robe in his bedroom.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  When it's time to change. 
[00:29:00]  Sing it, Dave.  That's a little bit close.  That's what you said, Bobby.  Yeah.  That's what Greg and Bobby would say when he'd come in the room and talk to him.  Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.  Na, na, na, na, na, na.  Wonderful, Dave.  All right, Dave.  Well, we like your voice, Dave.  What did you call about?  All right, thanks, Bobby.  I'm just going to punch out.  No.  What do you want to say?  His craft is plummeting toward the earth. 
[00:29:30]  You got this far in the phone call?  Yeah.  So finish, Dave.  I'll let her rip.  All right, pretty much, if anybody goes to the local radio station,  we can find out which stupid shit pics have celebrities on, but which, ah, fuck it.  Why?  It's interesting what you're saying.  Dave, basically, that's why we went to the phone call.  Well, we want you, as the faithful listener of the Opie & Anthony program, you pests out  there, to tune in to your local radio shows, and if they're having a guest on today, please 
[00:30:00]  give the program a call so we can actually have guests on our show today.  There you go.  That would be great.  That would be wonderful.  We'll hijack guests.  We're going to hijack guests from other radio shows.  Starting now!  So, a couple instant feedbacks, hell on ice, ha-ha, 20 minutes, first rope joke, and henchman  from Brooklyn goes, rope joke, check.  That's a, I was just talking to Nathaniel about that. 
[00:30:30]  That's one thing I want them to start looking for, is our crutches.  Crutches, huh?  Yeah, the stuff we say over and over and over again.  We got our crutches.  Can I quote Otto and George, who had a joke about, uh, George, I don't want, I don't  want Kershie to be a crutch.  He's in a crutch.  By this point, I think it's a motorized wheelchair.  Funny little fucking puppet.  He's a funny dude, man. 
[00:31:00]  Speaking of Laszlo, I guess he got in trouble.  He was doing a show on K-Rock here in New York City.  Yeah.  The home of hoo-hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo.  Rodbrick.  Who's getting rave reviews for his awful prank, by the way, in the New York Papers.  Who's giving him rave reviews?  His fans?  Yeah, the fans are kissing his ass, and then the stupid newspapers are, are just picking  up on that.  Mm-hmm.  I guess one caller called in and told him that it was the greatest radio prank since  War of the Worlds.  Or War of the... 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, War of the Worlds.  Okay, War of the Worlds.  Are you kidding me?  No.  Since War of the Worlds?  It was one of the hackiest things I've ever heard in my life.  Yeesh.  But anyway, so Laszlo...  Gotta say, that guy does do a great David Lee Roth impression.  Yeah, that part is good.  Gotta give the impressionist credit.  So Laszlo was doing a show for Hoo-Hoo's station here in New York.  And he did this, and I guess he's in trouble now with K-Rock in New York City.  We have a number of very important goals to accomplish together in this first lesson. 
[00:32:00]  Hey, how do you become a radio DJ?  Say the name of the station over and over.  Play at least a half hour of commercials.  Broadcast live from the quickie mark.  Smash lots of sounds together.  Talk on and on about how you invented radio.  Don't, Fred.  Play the same songs again and again and again and again.  We'll teach you how radio stations operate.  If only I could win practice.  Enough of this.  Start the stupid show, Laszlo. 
[00:32:30]  So that's our buddy Laszlo, who's going to be on the show tomorrow.  Who's kid is that?  I don't know.  It's great.  That's hysterical.  That was his show opener, and obviously, you know, the tell-em, Fred comes directly from  our show.  That's great.  And that's how he opened his show here in New York City on K-Rock.  And now, of course, because Howard doesn't have a sense of humor whatsoever, Laszlo's  in a lot of trouble just from that stupid little show opener.  Can you believe it?  Have a sense of humor, please.  We certainly lived your life, Laszlo. 
[00:33:00]  Trust me.  Working with people that don't have a sense of humor.  That is really funny.  You've got to hear it again.  About inventing, you know, inventing, and then tell them, Fred, listen.  Great little piece of production.  We have a number of very important goals to accomplish together in this first lesson.  Can we steal this, by the way?  Um, yes, I give permission.  We have a number of very important goals to accomplish together in this first lesson.  Hey, how do you become a radio DJ?  Say the name of the station over and over.  Play at least a half-hour commercial. 
[00:33:30]  Broadcast live from the cookie market.  Match lots of sounds together.  Talk on and on about how you invented radio.  Don't, Fred.  Woo-hoo-hoo.  Touch the station again and again and again and again.  We'll teach you how radio stations operate.  If only I could win traffic tickets.  I'm not going to start the stupid show, Laszlo.  Oh, God.  That's going to make me laugh all day.  That is fine.  Can we just isolate that one part?  I want to play that a hundred times today.  And we're going to have Laszlo on the show tomorrow. 
[00:34:00]  And what's the blog thing about?  No one knows?  What blog thing, Hawk?  I don't know.  We'll just play it.  It's Laszlo's K-Rock show blog bit.  Dear blog, I had a wicked cool day at the library.  I've really been obsessing about my old high school girlfriend, Julie, so much lately that  I said, what the hell?  I decided to look her up.  She lives in the next town over.  So I got her address, stopped by.  She was really surprised to see me. 
[00:34:30]  Then I slashed her throat.  That's a great ending.  Why isn't Laszlo doing more production for our show?  That sounds great.  We would definitely give him a lot of credit.  This is like us gawking over a hot bitch in front of Steve.  Steve is our production guy.  We get a couple of pieces of production from someone else, we listen, and we're just crowing 
[00:35:00]  over it.  Steve did a good job.  Remember that Ramon promo back in November?  Ramon.  Because I got to say, that sounds great.  Doesn't it?  The music, the voice, the reflection, everything.  It can't hurt to have other voices involved with this program, right?  Oh, boy.  Now you're...  Laszlo's good diction.  Who was that?  Was that...  I don't know.  It didn't sound like Laszlo.  It could have been Laszlo doing a voice.  It didn't sound like him.  Huh?  It didn't sound like him.  No?  That is.  He's got a great voice. 
[00:35:30]  Great voice.  All right.  So far, no guests on the phone lines.  If your local show is having a big star on today, please call the program and let us  listen in so we can hijack some guests today.  Okay?  Yeah, because if it's coming out of our radio, you know, if it's coming out of our station,  you're tuned in to us and you're hearing a famous celebrity.  Right.  Then it's like we have them here.  And we'll try to conduct an interview with them somehow.  We'll just ask them questions.  We'll ask them what? 
[00:36:00]  The same questions that the other jock's asking or different ones?  Or as they're giving the answer to the question that the local jock gives?  Yeah.  We'll just do a lot of, uh-huh.  Oh, really?  Oh, okay.  Oh, like that.  Oh, stop it.  And it'll sound like we're actually talking to the guests.  And you know how many people will just be casually listening and think, oh, yeah.  One had Tom Cruise on.  That's right.  Tom Cruise, are you insane?  No.  You know what it is?  When you have a conflict of interest, if you have one person serving two conflicting shows 
[00:36:30]  or mediums in any situation, it's not going to work.  In any situation.  Yeah.  I, uh, check.  Check.  A sidekick cook.  Cook.  I'm getting word that, uh, we got another blog bit from Laszlo.  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  Let's see.  Eric just running around like a madman.  Listen to this.  More, uh, another blog bit from Laszlo. 
[00:37:00]  Porterhouse.  Yes, sir, judge.  There's a brown hat battle parked in my parking space.  Yes, sir.  Get a tow truck over here and have it hauled away immediately.  By the way, judge.  By the way, sir.  You son of a bitches!  I don't get the pat battle thing.  There's a brown pat battle.  That's very funny.  Oh, that means they're continuing to come in.  Of course they are.  They rule.  That no one gets.  Everyone gets it.  No one gets.  And adores it. 
[00:37:30]  No one gets the pat battle thing.  That big lug pat battle.  She's the type you just want to give her, like, the one that put your, like,  the chin tap with your fist like that.  Yeah.  Good job, Pat.  Big lug.  That's perfect.  Big lug.  Hey, Pat Battle.  Help the judge find his checkbook, will you?  Oh.  Oh, hi.  Oh, hi.  That was the best.  Running across the golf course.  Oh, I, well, I, I usually, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. 
[00:38:00]  That was the best when Ted Knight went into that mode.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  All right.  Genius.  We're going to take our first break.  Right.  When we get back, we're going to have our first big celebrity.  And wait, I'd like to talk about the doctor's appointment.  What do we got?  I don't know.  appointment, two of them yesterday. About your foot?  Oh, yeah.  I did have that one. You went to that one?  Yes. How is your foot?  I wouldn't know.  I got a big thank you  to Dr. 
[00:38:30]  Jessica Galena.  Here in New York City on 58th Street.  A girly doctor. I want to thank her  very much. I arrived at 11.30  for my 11.30 appointment  and I still had not been seen by  1 o'clock. Holy crap.  We're nuts. I had a cardiologist  appointment at  2 o'clock and I told them that  and I sat there  for an hour  and a half. Oh, jeez.  I can't tell you.  The rage. I cannot 
[00:39:00]  tell you.  The rage. They don't care.  They could care less. Absolutely.  I went to one of the assistants and I was like,  look, I've been here for, this was at 30 minutes.  I'm like, what time do you think the doctor  will see me because I do have a cardiologist appointment?  She's like, well, there's two people ahead of you.  I'm like, all right, whatever.  Sometimes you get a long wait.  Uh-huh.  Five people at least walked in ahead of me.  Now, why?  Just taking people as they kind of came in.  That sounds like a personal vendetta.  It wasn't a vendetta.  I called. The secretary was actually nice. 
[00:39:30]  I called. I actually walked out  and I was muttering to myself.  People looked at me walking.  I walked out. I was like, fuck, fuck.  Right, like a lunatic.  When I left.  I was in the street just yelling, fuck.  I was so angry.  Walk out of a doctor's office cursing.  Yes.  I think you're a...  So I sat in Dr. Jessica Galina's office.  Mm-hmm.  And nothing.  58th Street.  Maybe she's a fine physician.  Yeah.  I believe it's New York Orthopedics.  Maybe her staff has a problem. 
[00:40:00]  I don't know what it is.  With organization.  All I know is maybe many of you  go see Dr. Galina  on 58th Street.  Maybe many of you make appointments with her  and have had better success than I have.  Maybe.  I think it's New York Orthopedics.  Yeah.  So you didn't see that doctor?  Never saw her.  No.  So my foot still hurts.  So thank you very much.  Unfortunately, I can't give her a number out.  I would love to give her a plug  because maybe people would want to go to her.  Yeah.  People are pretty creative. 
[00:40:30]  Did you see your other doctor?  My cardiologist?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  And that was okay.  My stress test.  He said,  you're not in great shape  but you're healthy enough to exercise.  Oh, Jesus.  Jesus.  That's good.  I'm not going to fall face first  if I just walk on the treadmill  a little bit.  Jeez, Jimmy.  You know how you're in bad shape  when they hook you up with all the wires  and you're there with your fat torso  and I'm marching on the treadmill  and the doctor's trying to talk to me  and I'm trying to not act out of breath  because I'm only on the first leg  of the stress test.  Oh, my God. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, Jimmy.  I am really awful.  Yeah?  Did they tell you to, what, lose weight?  No, I already know.  I'm actually losing a little bit.  I have more to go.  But no, I'm okay.  My heart's fine.  How's the cholesterol, Jimmy?  The cholesterol, when I went for my blood work,  was slightly high.  Nothing major.  Yeah.  How's your blood pressure?  Good.  It's actually low.  Goody good.  Even after being made to sit in the waiting room  for 90 minutes.  Wow, your voice just changed.  Dude, I can't.  I'm crazy.  He's crazy.  I was, I'm not even that angry right now. 
[00:41:30]  I was, I can't tell you how angry I was yesterday.  The arrogance of the medical profession.  And I know, look, this is not an emergency room.  Sometimes people have emergencies.  But there were people,  these people were fucking moonwalking into the office.  I saw them.  This is why I hate the left.  And you're, you know, it's funny you should mention that.  And your tootsie still hurts.  Yeah, it does hurt.  You're a little tootsie.  And so I call, and I say to the lady,  I've been there 90 minutes,  I said, look, I got a doctor,  I call the hospital in an hour. 
[00:42:00]  She goes, well, you're not going to make it.  Oh, great.  I'll blow the heart doctor off  so the foot lady can make me wait.  Maybe I'll read a Highlights magazine.  Oh.  One way, another hooky today.  Oh, yes.  Is this a celebrity?  I think we might be hijacking our first celebrity today.  Oh, what do we have?  Kirk in Charlotte.  Oh, dude, it's ending right now, man.  Hold on.  Damn it.  Hey, it's some guy named Donnie Southern  talking about chicken and dumplings night  at his restaurant.  Jesus. 
[00:42:30]  This is the best we could do?  Turned us down.  Dude, hey, no wonder why we're all tagging  the satellite down here, man.  All right.  Well, we're looking for our bigger celebrities than this.  Yes.  All right, well, here, I'll keep on the lookout,  but can I do a Ben's Hog?  Yeah, go ahead.  Ben's Hog is so big that he sucks cock by choice.  Punching out.  All right, thank you, sir.  If your local show is having a celebrity on today,  please let us pipe our show into it.  Yeah, we want to hear.  Definitely. 
[00:43:00]  We want to hijack your guests.  Mark in Kentucky, what's up?  I was just sitting here listening.  You know, the checklist was going along pretty good.  Thirty-six minutes for a Shining reference.  Thirty-six, thirty for Pat Battle.  Thirty-eight for the F-bomb.  Forty minutes for a hate the left.  And forty-one for a Ben's Hog.  We're going through the list pretty good.  Yeah, we're taking care of business here today.  We've done all our jokes.  I guess we could go home.  Damn it.  All right.  Thank you, sir. 
[00:43:30]  All right.  We've got a doctor on the line that wants to talk about Jimmy's stress test.  John?  Yeah, hey, guys.  Hey.  Hi, John.  Jimmy, was it a thalamus stress test?  Did they pump any liquid in you?  No, they did.  I don't even think they did an echocardiogram.  They just hooked me up.  And I had chest x-rays taken.  Like a couple weeks ago, they said they were fine.  There's no spots or anything on my lungs.  Now, how long did you do the stress test?  That's the key.  About 12 minutes.  Yeah, that's about average.  That's about average.  So I'm sure they did it on the treadmill where every three minutes they kept 
[00:44:00]  raising the platform for you?  Yes.  Okay.  Vince Hogg is so big it has its own zip code.  Punch.  Right.  The guy told you exactly what you said and knew.  Let's say hi to James in Connecticut.  James?  Hey, what's up there, little Jimmy?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, man.  These doctors really suck.  I went to the doctors with a broken finger, and I sat in his office in the front for an 
[00:44:30]  hour and a half for him to look through the window, tell me it's broken, to go get x-rays.  Dude, it was so irritating.  It's only because when you tell them you have a heart doctor appointment, they could move  it along a little bit.  And the secretary was really, she's the only reason I'm not completely going ballistic  today.  The secretary was nice.  She's like, look, we try to humanize this.  Sometimes people come in, they call, they say they're emergencies.  We try to take them.  The secretary was actually very sweet.  She's the only reason I didn't just spit on the window. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  But I just, I hated the whole thing, and I just, it's arrogant.  The black profession is arrogant, man.  Jimmy, that's very interesting, but we've got to break into your silly story because we  have a big star waiting to come on our show.  Who, O.P., who?  Ladies and gentlemen, it's George Carlin.  All right.  See, we're getting guests.  Terry, let's listen in to George Carlin.  All right.  Grace.  This is why this bit will never work.  Or maybe.  What's wrong with this guy's phone? 
[00:45:30]  Terry.  Terry.  Terry.  Yeah, how you folks doing this morning?  What's up, man?  All right.  Y'all were talking about Steven Spielberg with E.T.  Movie.  A couple weeks ago, Steven Spielberg, he's got to produce, he's not known to produce a Transformers  live action movie.  Oh, my God.  This phone, this guy's phone's insane.  We're talking about George Carlin.  No, and it's not even George Carlin.  They're going to have George Carlin on soon, so we can have George Carlin on our show.  If you guys are going to do this bit, you've got to do it right for us. 
[00:46:00]  People, look.  This is a great bit that we still haven't been able to get off the ground.  The bit is so simple.  Have a phone that's working and have the right thing going on at the other radio station.  We're looking for a guest.  We're looking for a station in your town somewhere across this great land of ours that is having  a guest right now, a celebrity guest.  Oh, my God.  It's easy.  Oh, God.  It's easy.  You turn up the radio just right.  Get the cell phone just right away from the speaker. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  No tin can speakers.  Maybe even test it out with Travis, who's working the phones right now.  Get it all set up.  Get it all set up nice.  Nicey, nice.  And then we plunk down, and then we hijack someone else's guest.  And we have a guest right there.  Exactly.  Not what you just heard.  That was awfulness.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Bastards.  Tell them, Fred!  Hoo-hoo-hoo!  Oh, I want...  That's funny.  Why?  What is that?  I wanted the whole, you know, how I invented radio part, too, in there. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, you know something?  That wasn't clear on your part.  Really?  I'm going to bail the guys out.  From what you said, it sounded like all you wanted was the tell them, Fred, hoo-hoo.  Doesn't it make more sense to have the setup before that?  Sometimes what comes out of your mouth makes no sense at all.  I'm the first to admit that.  Tell them, Fred!  Hoo-hoo-hoo!  That is funny.  That is funny.  It is good, but I think Ope wanted a little bit more than that.  A little more meat on the bone.  I think people might be...  Maybe if people cared.  People around here gave a damn. 
[00:47:30]  All right.  Whenever you hear, like, there's just a panic goes through that room.  Whenever you hear...  I know.  Their face is just...  You can't see it at home, but it's like this thing Ope does where he just gets this exasperated,  like, he won't look at me, or he just kind of looks in the air, and he just puts his right  hand up.  It's like...  He'll play the clip, look at his coffee, whatever is transpiring at that minute, and  just kind of put a hand up, look up, shut his eyes, go...  Like, ugh.  And Eric's boy hat tightens. 
[00:48:00]  Steve runs in.  As does his asshole.  Puckers up.  Steve's child shorts roll up more.  Hey, I don't know what happened.  Even sometimes he slurs.  I don't know what happened.  I don't know what happened.  I don't know what happened.  You know what goes through my mind.  I'm trying not to explode these days.  I honestly thought you meant that, too, though.  I'm trying to keep it all fun.  Fun, fun, fun.  Capital M.  All right, well...  Whatever happened to that?  Didn't we have something like that?  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:48:30]  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  And we just played a montage of our worst fights that we've had with people.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good idea for a new sweeper, boys and girls.  Steve did that one.  Yes.  Maybe he still has it somewhere.  All right, so why don't we take a break, and hopefully we'll get a big guest on the program after the break.  George Carlin would love this show.  It's uncensored radio.  Carlin would love being on this program.  How have we not had Carlin on here?  He could curse. 
[00:49:00]  He could say whatever he wants.  Why is Carlin not on this show?  Ozzy went crazy.  He loved it.  He loved the fact that he could curse.  Yep.  By the way, I'm hanging up on a lot of people today.  Don't take it personally.  Oh, they will.  Some of the faithful listeners take it personally, but we're trying to clear the phone line so we can get some guests on the show today.  Let's say hi to Adam in Indiana.  Adam.  Hey, what's up, ONA?  Hey.  Hi, sweetness.  Hey.  I broke a razor blade off into my wrist accidentally one time.  Accidentally, huh?  Yeah, accidentally, honestly.  But the problem is I only have one hand to begin with, so waiting in the doctor's office, bleeding all over the place, 
[00:49:30]  they said, oh, well, we need you to fill out these paperwork forms first, sir.  Folks, I only have one hand.  What's the matter with you people?  Oh, the paperwork, huh?  Yeah, oh, yeah.  I got to fill out all this paperwork while bleeding all over the place and holding a rag and wrist over my wrist with the only hand.  How many pages was the paperwork, you think?  Oh, it was only two pages.  Which is the point.  It wasn't too bad.  I understand they have to get paid.  How many questions, you think?  Got to get paid.  I don't recall.  I was a little fuzzy from the loss of blood. 
[00:50:00]  But it was awful.  Yeah, they want all that insurance information right up front.  Oh, yeah.  And at one point, I started to fade because of the loss of blood.  She says, oh, no, sir, you need to fill out all these other lines, too.  And it's like, how am I supposed to do this?  Can you help me out?  They're terrible.  I hate them.  Some doctors are great, but there is an arrogance in the medical profession that is just mind-boggling.  Oh, yeah.  This little bit of blue ink on this paper was much more important than my bleeding all over their counter. 
[00:50:30]  All right, Adam.  90 fucking minutes.  That's a long wait.  Let's go back to Alabama.  They get priority on this show.  Travis.  How you doing, Bama?  Yeah, I'm not actually from Alabama.  I'm from Ohio, but I'm in the military stuck in this southern godforsaken shithole.  But I used to be stationed in Alaska, and I was a paratrooper up there.  And we went out running and everything, and it gets significantly cold in Alaska.  And I got back from the run and went and pissed, and it was pure blood. 
[00:51:00]  And you know how your knees buckle as soon as you see a bright red substance coming off your mule.  So I went to the medics, and they're like, oh, you're just dehydrated.  You just drink some water and take some Motrin.  You know, you can suck it up.  You'll be all right.  Suck it up.  You're bleeding.  Yeah, you're bleeding.  You're bleeding when you piss.  Suck it up.  Were they right, though?  No, no.  What had happened was it gets so cold up there, you had to wear a cock sock.  But I had just gotten up there and didn't know any better, and I didn't have a...  All right, slow down.  You don't just... 
[00:51:30]  Dude, dude, you don't just blow past this show with a cock sock on.  What the hell is a cock sock?  What?  Where were you?  What was this?  I was stationed in Fort Richardson, Alaska, and it gets so cold up there that you have to put something extra around your cock and balls,  or else, you know, it hangs away from your body, so you get frostbite or frostbite on the tip of your wang.  And so you had to put, like, a cock or, you know, make something to where you could get all your jumblies all together so they didn't flop around while you were running.  I've never heard of this. 
[00:52:00]  I actually did, actually.  You did?  Well, Ben was in the military, but he always said that when he was away, he had to get a cock burlap bag.  I was going to say a sleeping bag.  I was going to say the military used decommissioned dirigibles.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony program, your official Opie and Anthony cock socks.  Cock socks.  We'll be handing out cock socks all week out.  Spread the virus, cock socks.  Email Opie's brother. 
[00:52:30]  At Dr. Duck.  Dr. Duck.  D-U-K at AOL.com.  Actually, if you want a pet shirt.  I'm looking to get my cock sock.  I'll wear it on my show.  Cock sock.  Cock sock.  Cock sock.  Yes, gentlemen.  It's called a cock sock.  It's a wonderful invention.  And what happened?  The cold weather affected your wiener and you started bleeding from it?  Well, obviously, it did something internally.  I really don't know.  The problem is in the military, they've got medics that aren't even like emergency medical technician qualified. 
[00:53:00]  This is about eight years ago.  Now they are.  But they're guys who just rate your pain, you know, one to ten or whatever.  Well, some guys can, you know, have a broken leg and be like, well, it hurts a little bit or whatever, you know.  So they ask you to rate your pain.  And they write like a complaint form and send it to a guy who's like middle level management who knows a little bit about the medical field.  And then it forwards to a doctor or whatever.  So most of the time you're just broken, especially like, you know, airborne infantry, airborne rangers and stuff. 
[00:53:30]  You know, they want us to suck it up.  They want us to play hurt, you know.  Right.  Because, you know, we're playing for the real deal.  So, you know, a lot of stuff goes, you know, oh, I broke my toe or whatever, you know.  Just suck it up.  Keep on going.  Keep on doing whatever.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  Thank you, Travis.  Thank you, Travis.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Hopefully we'll have our first guest that we can hijack after the break.  I hope so.  If your local morning show is having a big celebrity on today, please call the program so we can listen in. 
[00:54:00]  That's the only way we're going to get guests on this program.  Toolbag Johnson is suggesting, we call it the official shock jock cock sock.  Good job there, Toolbag.  O.B., Anthony, and Norton, too.  Good times, great hits.  That's F-202.  Suck my fucking cock.  Life sends through the hourglass. 
[00:54:30]  So is the O.B. virus.  Stepping up to the plate and getting involved with this reality programming.  Did the reality show really start?  Was it with?  I know the real world, but.  You've got to go back to the real world.  But they have other examples before that, but the real world really made reality program.  But when did it really.  But that was how long ago?  Fifteen years ago?  No.  The real world?  They're up to fifteen years.  We're talking fifteen years, dude. 
[00:55:00]  Fifteen years.  So I'm talking, it was there, but it really didn't, it didn't really start.  When did it really start where everything is?  Survivor.  Survivor?  Survivor.  Big brother.  Big brother.  You picked the biggest flop reality show.  Good job, B-Rock.  Everybody likes Eric.  What's wrong with you?  Eric, what do you call that?  Jesus, big.  Big brother was big.  Give him a microphone.  Give him a microphone.  Big brother was big.  Shut up, would you?  You really did pick the worst reality show. 
[00:55:30]  Actually, Opie, you loved that show.  I liked it, but no one was watching it.  But to put it as the reality show, that might have kicked off the whole craze.  Jesus, Eric.  It might have been Joe Millionaire.  Joe Millionaire was a big one.  I guess before then they had happened.  Survivor.  Survivor refused him.  I think Survivor kind of kicked that off.  What year was that?  I'm just wondering if the thousands here, the 2,000, is going to be known in the future  as that whole reality show decade.  Big brother. 
[00:56:00]  Big brother.  Nobody watched that and you're talking about it like it's the last mash.  Oh, they love when Eric fucks up.  They love it.  They certainly do.  You know what?  They're all just sitting there waiting to take his place.  You know what Eric Ford Grove needs?  A gas can and a match.  We got to chip in and get this kid a couple of shirts that don't belong on a five-year-old.  He is just like Spanky McFarlane today.  Every fucking shirt he has should come with a lollipop and an incest survival story.  One of those huge lollipops.  Just a big lolly and a hat with a propeller on it. 
[00:56:30]  You have to put him in knickers in one of these things just to skip around.  Well, I don't know about something like that.  That's kind of racist.  But I mean, I...  Oh, I bet.  Oh, the short pants.  Oh, okay.  Bill needs coffee.  You need coffee?  Bill needs coffee.  Oh, my God, nice.  Eric Getsch, retarded child clothes.  Don't make a fucking good dresser out of me.  Eddie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  They call me cowboy. 
[00:57:00]  I'm a singer in black.  So throw a finger in the air.  Let me see where you're at and say.  Hey, hey.  Let me hear where you're at and say.  Hey, hey.  I'm giving it back.  So say.  Hey, hey.  Show me some math and say.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  Fuck all y'all.  Ah, yes.  Fuck all y'all.  Still waiting for our first guest to join the program, Anthony.  We're going to hijack guests from other radio shows today, hopefully. 
[00:57:30]  We've got to do what we've got to do.  So far, we're having no luck.  Now, tell me if this sounds better.  If not, fine.  Okay.  Talk on and on about how you invented radio.  Tell him, Fred.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  Or we just go with tell him, Fred.  Hmm.  Talk on and on about how you invented radio.  Tell him, Fred. 
[00:58:00]  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  That's kind of funny.  The clip's talked a little bit, right?  Yeah.  Kind of jumps in there.  Was it a tough edit?  Talk on and on about how you invented radio.  Tell him, Fred.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  Tell him, Fred.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  Can I get that on here?  That's great.  Immediately.  Immediately.  Only the Bible outsells Harry.  Harry.  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.  Hi, Harry.  Shattered World Records Yesterday is the fastest-selling book ever. 
[00:58:30]  Outdoing just about everything except the Bible.  The Bible.  The Bible's still in first place, Anthony.  A little good versus evil kind of thing.  Still at the top of the countdown.  The latest book in the seven-volume series, chronicling the exploits of the orphaned teen wizard, sold nearly, holy shit, 10 million copies in the first 24 hours.  Unbelievable. 
[00:59:00]  10 million readers.  Too many.  Looks like we got ourselves a reader.  Wow.  That's too much reading.  Wow.  The 39-year-old British writer has made it in excess of $800 million and could hit $1 billion by next year, experts believe.  Wow.  So, there you have it.  Selling like hotcakes.  Hotcakes?  I was thinking about that yesterday.  What?  Hotcakes?  Do they sell that?  They do. 
[00:59:30]  They do?  Man.  Is that one of those hacky lines that comedians use all the time?  Yeah.  But what is a hotcake?  And do they sell that well?  It's a pan-pancake.  Flapjack.  A flapjack.  Another word for a pancake.  All right.  Hotcakes.  Let's say hi to John in Ohio.  John?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Hey, there's a local radio station, 92-3, out here that's going to have Norton in the studio at 9 o'clock.  In studio?  I'm calling in to Rover.  Well, they said that you are going to be there at 9 a.m. 
[01:00:00]  Uh-oh.  There must be a miscommunication.  You better leave now.  Yeah, you better hurry up.  Get on a plane there, Jimmy.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I got to get the number for Rover, actually, because I can't find the number I got to do it for.  When are you supposed to call?  Nine o'clock.  Nine?  I'm pointing my show, yeah, in Cleveland.  That'd be odd.  Yeah, maybe someone could send in the number so he could call the station.  Still waiting to hijack our first celebrity, Anthony. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, because, I mean, why would anyone want to book a guest on this show?  I mean, the fact is, XM, how many million people now have XM?  It's disgusting how big this company.  It's huge.  Oh, yeah.  Huge.  Growing by leaps and bounds, as they say.  XM is blowing up.  Yeah.  Yes.  Hugeness.  And, well, we're still not getting real celebrities on the show.  Every once in a while, we do.  Yeah, of course.  Every once in a while, we get a bone.  Oh, yeah, those guys are there, right.  But for the money we're paying them, it's ridiculous.  It's partially them, I agree.  All right. 
[01:01:00]  Anthony.  Yeah.  As we wait for our first celebrity hijacking.  Oh, that bit's going nowhere.  Help us out, please.  Gee, people.  Please, please, please.  Please.  Just call us up with a guest on a show on a radio station near you, and we'll put it on  the air.  Okay, Pookie.  Okay, bad battle. 
[01:01:30]  Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  Yeah.  We've been doing this from time to time, the TV edit.  Isn't this great?  The TV edit of Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  Hey, Rhett, would you get that out of the hamper?  We love Fast Times, and the TV version stinks.  That's right.  There's so much filth in that movie that they actually have to put in parts that they left  on the editing room floor when they made the movie.  They picked up little pieces that sucked, that weren't good enough to be in the movie, and 
[01:02:00]  threw them in, and cut out scenes like Phoebe Cates deep-throating a carrot, and Phoebe Cates  opening her top.  Yeah, how do they cover that up?  I've seen it done a couple of ways.  I've seen them just cut the whole scene out.  She gets out of the pool, and then it goes to them kissing.  They show an extended scene of, what's-his-facey there, jerking off in the bathroom? 
[01:02:30]  Judge Reinhold.  Judge Reinhold.  Judge, right.  And they show an extended scene of him jacking it, and then the next scene is him holding  her and kissing her, so you can't see her boobies.  Right.  All right, well, we got to Fast Times at Ridgemont High TV edit.  Where is this from?  Do we know?  TBS.  TBS.  They're the worst.  They're the worst.  They are the worst.  So let's go to the first clip.  This is the-  Original?  Original dialogue.  Yes, Anthony.  There's someone else in the hotel with us. 
[01:03:00]  Pat battles in one of the rooms.  She tried to strangle Danny.  You got me again, you son of a bitch.  I fucking hate the pat battles, man.  Now I got to hear that again.  You asses.  There's someone else in the hotel with us.  Pat battles in one of the rooms.  She tried to strangle Danny.  Pat battles in one of the rooms. 
[01:03:30]  I fucking don't get it.  Pat battle, by the way, is headlining the small stage at Ozzfest this year.  Oh.  She just ruled.  Nice.  It's all about pat battle.  Pat battle.  Pat battle.  I think I got the right one now.  Thanks.  Right?  Thanks for that, guys.  Appreciate the pat battle thing.  It's so fun.  I love pat battle.  Love it.  Look at her picture.  She's wearing a smart...  That is a smart outfit.  A smart bluish suit jacket.  And she has that blondish, very natural for a black woman coif. 
[01:04:00]  And a colorful background and a nice smile.  That is great.  She looks just like Earl Campbell.  She really is.  Is that picture up on opiananthony.com?  If it isn't, it should be.  Why don't we take a picture of Jimmy holding up the picture of Pat battle?  This picture should be up in Times Square.  It's just amazing.  Every time you see it, you want to give it the thumbs up.  Go, Pat.  That's right.  Let's say hi to Randy in Boston.  Randy. 
[01:04:30]  Hey.  I got the penis puppeteers on.  They're on right now.  All right.  Let's listen to the penis puppeteers.  I was practically non-herbal.  That's probably the only reason I showed up.  So have you developed any of your own creations?  You know, it's always an evolving art form.  I love it.  Have your parents come to see you perform here?  Believe it or not, my mother.  Your mother has.  Oh, my God.  These are the guys that make stuff out of their penises.  They had an off-Broadway show. 
[01:05:00]  You let your mother see your penis?  Yeah.  They must be very proud.  So let me ask you something, Joey, because it seems to me like Daisy Kulo and DJ Puff Dog  are very insecure with their sexuality, and they're all talking about this morning how  they wouldn't go around in the circle and whip their thing out in front of other guys.  Now, when you guys are on stage, there's eight or nine of you that stand around in the  circle and whip it out.  I mean, you guys don't get, you know, a little uneasy because you're doing that with other  guys around? 
[01:05:30]  You don't see what I have to work next to.  You don't see what I get you.  I get you.  So what we're going to do now, well, first of all, Puppeteer of the Penis is happening  at the Lyric Stage, 140 Clarendon Street.  If you want to get tickets, go ahead and get a mess.  Yes, okay.  Call the theater.  What do we want to do now?  What do we want to do?  7-8-7-discounted tickets.  Yeah, why don't we see some of the stuff you guys can do with your penises?  What kind of groups do you get?  I mean, what's the ratio as far as women and men coming to your shows? 
[01:06:00]  I would say it's probably 85% women.  And 15% fags then, right?  Is that what you're getting at with the...  Yeah, you know, a lot of them have...  Out in the lobby, they sell, like, face masks that are shaped like crackers.  The thing about it is, anybody who does actually go to the show, put away their fears.  They always have a good time, and I guarantee you they're going to get laid.  Right.  Oh, really?  Oh, he's guaranteeing.  You're going to get laid.  That sounds great.  Is this a hamburger penis? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  Is this some trick that anybody can do?  Like, could I do it and stuff?  You know?  I think I could teach everybody just about every trick.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, let's see the hamburger.  If you're romantic with somebody, do you kind of say, hey, want to see something real  cool?  Enough of this palaver.  Let's hear the...  Let's hear.  Let's see the...  Yeah, let's get into it.  The trick rule is we don't work hard.  Let's get into the penis hamburger.  Good point.  Yeah.  I want to see four of them stand together and make a W.  How do you say it on a rouse?  Limp.  Because I know that sometimes, you know what?  Like, when I get tired, that's one of my big times. 
[01:07:00]  When I get a little tired, all of a sudden, I'm like, oh, yeah.  Or it could just be anything.  I'm like, maybe right now, in a couple minutes, I'll be like, oh, yeah.  You got a lot of rouse last night, I hope.  Yeah, no, I did.  But I'm saying, how do you make sure that you, you know, like, let's say you're...  Oh, my God.  Yeah, how do you not get a boner?  Why are they doing a normal interview with these guys?  We've had them on the show.  They whip it out.  They make cute things with their penises.  And then we move on.  And then you get in trouble with the FCC.  Exactly.  There's only one drink that you can do, you know, in that state. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  It's not very pretty.  It's called the hockey stick.  Yeah, the spitting cobra.  I don't...  What?  I'm going to turn these people into the FCC.  You know, the official line is, no, it never happens.  Okay.  Because, you know, when you first start doing it, you're pretty.  All right, well, this is all we got, huh?  This is it.  The puppetry of the penis, guys.  Right.  They get naked and they make stuff out of their penises.  Yeah.  You know, you just go in, you punch the fuck, and you take off your clothes.  All right.  I understand Ben was joining our crew.  It's all right. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah?  They needed somebody to do these stonehenes.  Quite honestly, we were in Hollywood.  Yeah.  And, you know, the ladies in Hollywood there, you know.  All right.  Thank you, Randy in Boston.  Our first celebrity hijacking.  Got to start somewhere, right, Anthony?  We had puppetry of the penis, guys, on our show today.  Yes.  Right down in the guest slot.  Did my horrible bomb bleed through?  Oof.  Oh, no.  What did you say?  Oh, you didn't hear it?  No.  Oh, did I bomb horribly?  Damn it.  I said Ben was joining puppetry of the penis because they needed somebody to reenact Stonehenge. 
[01:08:30]  That's not bad.  I just didn't hear it.  Damn it.  We're bad listeners.  Ben's writing.  Bad listeners.  What's it say?  Doug.  Oh, shit.  All right.  This is something good.  I emailed.  I emailed.  What is it?  What is he doing?  Okay.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  Secret message?  No, it does.  What's wrong?  No, it was I emailed the PD to get me the phone number.  Oh, good.  Okay.  I just didn't know what it meant at first.  All right.  Back to Fast Times at Ridgemont High. 
[01:09:00]  The TV edit, Anthony.  Here's the original dialogue, and then we'll play the TBS version, okay?  Right.  Hey, Charles.  How you doing, buddy?  Car looks great.  I mean, really terrific.  You're really keeping it up wonderfully.  Don't fuck with it.  All right.  Yeah.  It's got to be don't fool with it.  Hey, Charles.  How you doing, buddy?  Car looks great.  I mean, really terrific.  You're really keeping it up wonderfully.  Don't fool with it. 
[01:09:30]  Right.  Don't fool with it.  Don't fool with it.  That's just as good, right?  Don't fool with it.  This guy's been stoned since the third grade.  Uh-oh.  Are you kidding?  They weren't.  It's TBS.  They couldn't say stoned?  This guy's been strange since the third grade.  Oh!  Oh!  What?  What?  Oh!  What?  What?  Oh!  Turner Broadcasting, because when your wife sits on enemy tanks, don't do drug jokes. 
[01:10:00]  Puh.  You.  Oh!  It's that bad?  Yep.  And that has nothing to do with the FCC.  Yeah, that's a joke and call by the bigwigs at TBS.  That has nothing to do with it.  We don't want no drug humor.  What's your Atlanta dummies?  Goddamn drug jokes.  Hey, bud.  What's your problem?  No problem at all.  I think you know where the front office is.  You dick!  Uh-oh. 
[01:10:30]  What are they going to put in that place?  And you can say you dick, right?  You dick.  Yeah.  You can say it.  Of course you can.  Hey, bud.  What's your problem?  No problem at all.  I think you know where the front office is.  You nerd!  Oh, the voice is bad.  Oh, God.  You nerd!  You nerd!  You nerd!  I remember watching this and having to turn it off.  You cringe, right?  Yeah.  It's so bad.  You nerd! 
[01:11:00]  Nerd.  You hear about the surfer guy who pulled a knife in Mr. Hand this morning?  Oh, no.  He just called him a dick.  Dick?  Oh, God.  People exaggerate so much here.  See, that's...  You could say that on TV.  Of course you can.  Oh, nuts.  You hear about the surfer guy who pulled a knife in Mr. Hand this morning?  Oh, no.  He just called him a nerd.  A nerd?  Oh, people exaggerate so much here.  Just called him a nerd!  People exaggerate because he used the word nerd? 
[01:11:30]  The word nerd.  I'm in love.  You are a wuss.  Part wimp and part pussy.  What do you mean wuss?  This girl is my exact type.  Oh, no.  You can't say pussy.  You're going to be surprised, actually.  Really?  I'm in love.  You are a wimp.  Part simp and part weakly.  What do you mean this girl is my exact type?  Wait.  Let me...  We...  We... 
[01:12:00]  We...  We...  We...  We...  Weakling?  Wink...  They started by taking out you're a wuss.  Wuss.  And turned it into you're a wimp.  You're a wimp.  Part...  What's wrong with saying you're a wuss?  A wuss.  I'm in love.  You are a wimp.  Part simp and part weakly.  What do you mean this girl is...  Isn't that a sinkling or a sickling or...  Part simp?  Simp.  Wimp and weakling would be simpling.  How does he get wimp out of that? 
[01:12:30]  Wait.  This is the original line.  I'm in love.  You are a wuss.  Part wimp and part pussy.  What do you mean wuss?  This girl is my exact type.  All right.  A wuss.  Part wimp.  Part pussy.  Pussy.  Wuss.  I'm in love.  You are a wimp.  Part simp and part weakling.  What do you mean this girl is my exact type?  It would be weakling and simp.  It would be wimp.  That's the worst.  Oh, is that horrid? 
[01:13:00]  Is that amazing?  Oh, it's a crime.  That's the attitude.  The attitude?  Yeah.  The attitude dictates that you don't care whether she comes, stays, lays, or prays.  I mean, whatever happens, your toes are still tapping.  Oh, the delivery is much too fast for them to edit in something nice.  What is this horror show going to be?  That's the attitude.  The attitude?  Yeah.  The attitude dictates that you don't care whether she cries, shouts, laughs, or pouts.  I mean, whatever happens, your toes are still tapping. 
[01:13:30]  It doesn't even make sense.  I can't even listen to this.  Garbage.  Cries, shouts, laughs, or pouts.  Why?  Is she coming to town?  They might as well edit it with penguin sounds at that point.  Oh, just do that.  It's a bunch of wah-wahs.  Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah.  It makes as much sense.  Wow.  All right.  All right.  How do you feel?  I feel good.  Do you?  All right. 
[01:14:00]  Now stop fucking around and go get her.  All right.  Stop fooling around.  Obviously, you've got to get rid of the fuck in there, right?  All right.  All right.  How do you feel?  I feel good.  Do you?  All right.  Now stop butsing around and go get her.  Stop butsing around.  Butsing around.  Buttons.  Buttons around.  Stop butsing around.  Butsing around.  Stop butsing around, Jimmy.  It says 100% guaranteed, you moron.  Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm going to kick 100% of your ass.  All right.  You can say that on TV.  That's a great scene. 
[01:14:30]  And you can say that.  The FCC will allow you to say that.  You can say that in the Vatican.  Yeah.  It says 100% guaranteed, you moron.  Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm going to kick 100% of your face.  That's a great one.  Your face.  Your face.  I hate Turner Broadcast.  All right, Hamilton.  I hope you had a hell of a piss, Arnold.  That's one of the more classic lines from the movie. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  I hope you had a hell of a break, Arnold.  When he's in the bathroom, scrubbing big fat pussy off the wind mirror.  They blur it out.  It gets better.  Remember this line.  A lot of people expect that maybe Mark Cutback Davis or Bob Jungle Death Gerard would take  the honors this year.  Oh, those guys are fags.  It's a classic line.  It's a classic line. 
[01:15:30]  Those guys are fags.  A lot of people expect that maybe Mark Cutback Davis or Bob Jungle Death Gerard would take  the honors this year.  Oh, those guys are fools.  I can't.  I can't.  Oh.  Dad says you're going to be late again, you butthole.  You can't say butthole.  Butthole.  No, you can't.  Dad says you're going to be late again, you booger.  That's what he says after that. 
[01:16:00]  They throw it in twice.  I guess so.  If you'd apologize to Dennis, I'm sure he'd take you back.  Fuck Dennis Taylor.  Fuck Dennis Taylor.  Well, obviously you've got to get rid of him.  I'm a single successful guy.  Right.  That movie's great.  Obviously you've got to get rid of the fucking.  If you'd apologize to Dennis, I'm sure he'd take you back.  Damn Dennis Taylor.  Damn Dennis Taylor.  Damn, damn, damn. 
[01:16:30]  Eek.  Hey, man, just be glad I had fast reflexes.  My brother's going to shit.  Make up your mind, dude.  Is he going to shit or is he going to kill us?  My brother's going to shit.  Then he's going to kill us.  Another classic line from the movie.  Toolbag wants to know who does Spicoli's voiceovers.  James Gum.  Yeah, I did hear that a little bit.  A few great big fat fags.  Those guys are fools.  Hey, man, just be glad I had fast reflexes. 
[01:17:00]  My brother's going to flip.  Well, make up your mind, dude.  Is he going to flip or is he going to kill us?  First he's going to flip and then he's going to kill us.  That's fine because you can't say shit.  I mean, that's...  Oh, just don't play the movie.  Yeah, really.  Leave the movie to the big boys.  Right.  Just give it to HBO and be done with it.  Linda, you didn't show up.  That little prick.  I called his house.  And his mother told me that he was in the garage helping his father. 
[01:17:30]  Well, Mike DeMole's a no-brain little prick, Stacey.  I'm not going to let him get away with this.  Linda, please don't do anything.  I don't even like the guy.  Stacey, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick.  They put in cock.  Right?  Linda, you didn't show up.  That little pig.  I called his house.  And his mother told me that he was in the garage helping his father. 
[01:18:00]  Well, Mike DeMole's a no-brain little pig, Stacey.  I'm not going to let him get away with this.  Linda, please don't do anything.  I don't even like the guy.  Stacey, he's not a guy.  He's a little pig.  Oh, man.  Just awful, right?  And we've got to get one of them abortions.  She never really was your girlfriend, right?  Hey, fuck you, DeMole.  Ooh.  She never really was your girlfriend. 
[01:18:30]  Hey, face it, DeMole.  What?  Face it, DeMole.  Face it, DeMole.  Eek.  Strong words.  Oh, you should be coming on pretty soon, dude.  How much do you smoke?  This will be a little demonstration of that.  Listen up.  This is my favorite.  That was my skull.  I'm so wasted. 
[01:19:00]  They can't make drug references.  There wasn't one bad word in that whole stretch of dialogue, but you can't make drug references.  So the FCC will allow that on TV right there.  Of course.  This is how they clean it up.  You must have surfed all day long, dude.  How good were the waves?  This will be a little demonstration of that.  Listen up.  That was my skull.  Where are you going after the exams, dude?  What?  What? 
[01:19:30]  That made no sense whatsoever.  It doesn't have to make sense.  It just has to be cleaned up.  It doesn't even have to make sense.  You surfed all day, so he hits himself on the head with his sneaker, and that shows that the waves were good.  And where are you going to be after the exam?  Like they were taking exams.  Like they're talking about a test.  That's just amazing.  Oh, it's horrid.  What do you think? 
[01:20:00]  I have another version where I call him an asshole.  No, that one's better.  It's more mature.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, they got to clean that up.  What do you think?  I have another version where I call him an idiot.  No, that one's better.  It's more mature.  Yeah.  Idiot.  All right.  And finally, the last one.  The TV edit of Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  They just taught me the procedure, and let me figure it out.  No, let me figure it out.  Come on, shithead, let's go.  Get off my case, motherfucker. 
[01:20:30]  And this is how they cleaned it up on TBS.  They just taught me the procedure, and let me figure it out.  No, let me figure it out.  Come on, stupid, let's go.  Get off my case, will you?  Damn you.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Awful.  Chop it up.  Get off my case, Mr. Falcon.  Mr. Falcon.  See, that's what's more dangerous than the FCC.  Everyone's always talking about the FCC, FCC, FCC, but it's the people that actually run these networks that are more dangerous. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, they are editing.  One lousy guy at TBS decides, you know, I just don't want drug references on my channel.  Right.  But those are acceptable, sir.  I don't care.  No drug references.  Yeah, when you start editing for content like that and not for language, eh, it's really bad.  Really bad.  Imagine, I wonder how they feel, the people that put that movie together, the director, writer, when they catch that. 
[01:21:30]  They've got to sit and surf the channels and go, hey, here's my movie, and just watch somebody's butchered version of your writing.  Hmm, I wonder how that is, Anthony.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Don't you remember?  Yeah, kind of.  The same thing happened to us on commercial radio.  We were on a 30-something second delay, and we would be having a grand old time in the studio laughing our asses off.  Oh, off.  And then the phones would go crazy and go, guys, why are you laughing? 
[01:22:00]  They dumped out of something because I didn't catch anything you said.  And then they started dumping out of stuff that had nothing to do with the FCC.  We went through the same thing.  It enrages you.  It goes right through you.  Yes, it does.  All right.  Oh, I want a low-fat apple thing.  Low-fat apple?  Mmm.  You want your apple cake today?  I want my apple cake.  That shit is so good, and it makes my whole area smell so nice and apple cinnamony. 
[01:22:30]  It really does.  Thank you, sir.  By the way, the picture of Norton holding up the pet battle photo is now up on opandanthony.com.  Look how cute the birthday boy is.  Oh, who could tell he was so aggravated at the doctor?  As he limps over to take a look at the picture.  Look how bright his smiling face is.  Holding pat battle.  All right.  We're going to take a break, Anthony.  We're looking to have celebrities on our show today. 
[01:23:00]  So far, we've had, what, the penis guys on.  Yeah.  We're hijacking guests from other morning shows across America today.  So, if your local morning show is having a big celebrity on today, please give us a call so we can listen in and hijack that celebrity.  Yeah.  That's the only way we're going to get real guests on this program, okay?  Right.  All right.  Let's see how this comes out. 
[01:23:30]  All right.  They're right there.  All right.  Here we go.  I got a break.  I'm going to throw up my picture.  I can't.  This is a story about a man, and he always was so lonely at night, but his voice was rowdy.  You can hear it all through this train station, and I'm going to sing this one. 
[01:24:00]  This is about Tippy-toe Tommy.  Let's go while we're young.  Let's go while we're young. 
[01:24:30]  Let's go while we're young. 
[01:25:00]  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain.  There's just a little peace.  I'm living with so much pain.  I'm living with so much pain.  I'm living with so much pain.  I'm living with so much pain.  I'm living with so much pain.  I'm stealing your intentions 
[01:25:30]  And the sitting with an oil  Crying, wait up  And the two oscillations  Still you'll be the slides  From the tablecloth  La la la la la la la la la  Everybody's going to the party  Have a real good time  Dancing in the desert 
[01:26:00]  Blowing up the sunshine  You know he's not washing his hands  He knows he's rushed  We're back with Norton and Friends  Oh, it's your birthday  So sure, it's your show today, Jimmy  Hope he went to take a leak  Like two seconds before we were  Our first guest on Norton and Friends  My good friend Greg 
[01:26:30]  Is stopping in the studio  There it is  Fresh from a tinkle  Hi, Jimmy  Hi, Ope  Hope you had a nice piss, Opie  No, it wasn't piss though  Hope you had a nice break, Opie  Alright, let's say hi to Eric  In New York City  Eric, what's going on?  Hey, good morning, boys  Hi  You know you missed it  Tom Arnold was on PLJ  With Scott and Todd  Who was?  Tom Arnold?  Wait, Tom Arnold's in New York City  And we can't get him on the show  Why?  Did we know Tom Arnold was in the city?  Hey, he's a big star  It was pretty funny 
[01:27:00]  But it was a lame interview  Alright  They're done?  Happy birthday, Jimmy  Damn it  Alright, well we couldn't  Of course we didn't get him on  We couldn't hijack Tom Arnold today  No  We're looking to hijack guests from other shows today  Jimmy is so annoyed today  I love it  Fuming  I love it  People are annoyed  I get depressed  I'm just cranky  I'm cranky because we have no guests  And I want to fucking bite somebody  And I'm annoyed because I asked for one of the guys to get me a bagel  And I know I'm nitpicking  I wanted a bagel and a coffee  Could you toast a bagel?  Okay  He comes back from Starbucks  Just with coffee 
[01:27:30]  Dude, the Starbucks didn't have a toaster  Yeah, I know  I guess it's kind of hard to find a place that might toast a bagel in Manhattan  We have a toaster in the back, by the way  So even if you just bring back a bagel, we could toast it up  Oh, really?  Yeah  We got a little thing back there  We could toast it right here, on site  Huh?  We could toast it right here, on site  Yeah  There's a deli downstairs  I just want a bagel with a little cream cheese on the side  Yeah  You know, he was probably, like, freaking out  At the prospect of taking longer  Because he had to go to two places 
[01:28:00]  So what does he do?  Come up with a coffee  And then go find another bagel  Or do the whole thing at once  A lot of pressure on those guys  Jimmy  Looks like he's going to kill somebody  I'm so irritated, dude  I hate being like this  Birthdays suck ass  They're awful  They stink  When was the last time you looked forward to a birthday?  I think it was probably 18  You looked forward to your 18th birthday 
[01:28:30]  That was about it, though  After that, what the hell's the  What are you celebrating?  Another day closer to the dirt nap  That's all it represents, people  When you're a kid  You're looking forward to things  That's why shit takes forever when you're a kid  Remember when you were a kid  How long it took from one Christmas to the next?  I'm serious  Really put yourself back there as a kid for a second  Remember how long that took  You know why it took so long? 
[01:29:00]  As a kid  You're constantly looking forward to things  And when you're waiting for something to happen  It takes a long time  So if you're sitting and waiting for your birthday  And Christmas  And summer vacation  And things like that  Life takes forever  That's why your youth seem to take forever  Then when you get older  You're constantly putting shit off  Shit is in the future that you don't want happening  Bills have to be paid  You gotta go to work  You gotta do this, that, the other thing  You're in a rush  And when you put shit off 
[01:29:30]  They seem to creep up quicker  So all of a sudden  There goes your life  22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30  No one looks forward to their birthday  And this past May 23rd  33 years old for me  There you go  That's why shit goes by so quick  The older you get  And I can't  You ever see those commercials  For like Centrum Gold and stuff  Where they got the old couple going  I'm having the best years of my life 
[01:30:00]  You must add one shitty earth childhood  And early adulthood  This pissing yourself  And fucking  And fucking smelling old lady skin  When you kiss your woman  Yeah, it's the best days of your life  Yeah  You want a taste of reality  No one likes birthdays  Why don't we talk about that fine soldier  That passed away overnight, Anthony  William Westmoreland  A little taste of reality  91 years old  Young  William Westmoreland  He was the face of Vietnam 
[01:30:30]  He was the guy in charge  He was the guy on TV  Almost every night  He was the guy  Talking about the death counts  And this  And what we're doing  And what we're doing  And we're going to kill more of them  Than they kill of us  That's it  He was Vietnam  As far as a visual  He had all the stick-to-itiveness  Even after the Ted Offensive  Wanted to keep going  Wanted to win that war  He came across on TV  Like a tough son of a bitch  Guy in charge  The general 
[01:31:00]  That's right  Yeah  Well, let's fast forward  91 years old  The guy is in a nursing home  And he drops dead  In his own urine and shit  I'm sure  Awful  You think he'd rather be  Laying there  Laying there  In his own stuff  Fading away  Or maybe  Taken out in the nom  In a rice patty  Hmm  Time is a bitch  It's just a bitch 
[01:31:30]  And the whole thing  With the birthday  Who's celebrating birthdays  Get them over with  You know what a great day is  The day after your birthday  Because it's another year  Until your next one  That's it  Jimmy's already depressed  Anthony  How do we  Oh, fuck Jimmy  I'd love that  That'd be a nice  Happy birthday, fella  Hope on one side  Ant and the other  Jimmy in the middle  Go  Fuck  Jesus 
[01:32:00]  JP  Plenty of room on that  Back to play cards  John the rotisserie  JP, what's up?  Hey, Anthony  What's up?  Hi  You say longer  Like you say finger  Longer  Alright, look, assholes  I've had it  I speak the way I speak  You don't like it  Lump it, I say  You put them through the ringer  There's no reason for it  How do I say longer?  Is it supposed to be longer?  Yes  Stop it  It's longer  I don't care  Longer, longer, longer, longer 
[01:32:30]  That's the way I'm saying it  Finger, finger, finger, finger  That's how I'm saying it  Don't care  Don't care  You want me to keep my finger  In your ass longer, JP?  I'll do that  How about that?  He'll linger longer  I'll linger longer  In your ass with my fur  I  You know, I can't  I can't satisfy everyone  With my pronunciations  Of things  This show is getting close  To going into the silly zone  You know that, right?  You mother  Alright, we got a couple things  We could do here, Anthony  Because we have absolutely 
[01:33:00]  Nothing on the prep sheet  That I feel like going to  I didn't even know Tom Arnold  Was in New York  Isn't there somebody  Supposed to let us know  At least  Or be looking out  When celebrities are in New York  I don't know  Letting us know  Yeah, I would say so  Sure  Don Wicklin  He's in charge of 202  And he's doing a great job  Anthony, the Tet Offensive  Was a military disaster  For the Viet Cong  So stick-to-it-ness  Was inappropriate  Yeah, but it wasn't a disaster  As far as morale went  As far as everybody saying  That was the point  That the war was unwinnable  It was 
[01:33:30]  It was a strike  To our military  When they said  That there was no way  That the Viet Cong  Could mount  An organized attack  That is why  The Tet Offensive  Was good for the VC  It was a military disaster  They got their asses  Handed to him during it  But it showed  That they were still  Organized enough  To make an attack  On separate cities  So  Nya, nya, nya, nya, nya, Tim 
[01:34:00]  Forget Aristotle  And fuck  Socrates  Jesus  Here comes Professor Anthony  That's something anyone  Could pick up on the  History Channel  Yeah, of course  Until you just said that  I thought we launched  The Tet Offensive  Oh, no  I had no idea  I couldn't even spell Tet  What do you mean Tet?  Tet  I thought it was Ted  The Tet Offensive  I thought it  All right, here we go  Go get him, Ted  A couple things going on  With the Opie and Anthony show  We're going to do this 
[01:34:30]  Tribute concert eventually  Tribute band concert  We're waiting for Brother Joe  Who is just blown up  To the point that  I know  We can't even get him  To do our gigs anymore  Brother Joe has a U2 tribute band  We want him to pretty much  Headline this thing  Because this is where  We got the idea from  So we're waiting for  You know, a spot to open up  In his very busy schedule  We need a clear in his schedule  Yeah, he's flying to Mexico  He said, Ireland  Dublin  He's going all over the world  With this U2 tribute band  But when he gets an open date  We're going to book something

[01:36:30]  I'm going to pot it way down  So now we should be able  To hear this a little better  All right, let's hear  The latest  Pat Battle  Thing  And when Pat Battle  Tried to prevent me  From doing my duty  I  Corrected her  Oh, it comes in a little box today  Thank you  Oh, appley  Say thank you to Mike  Thank you, Mike

Well, I was in the 80s, right?  80, 81  Yeah  Alright, thank you Eric  You got it  I think we're gonna want them  As part of this concert  That we're slowly but surely  Putting together  Yeah  Let's say hi to Rob  Rob, what's going on?  Yeah, I just wanted to take this off  Opportunity to say that  Jimmy sucks  His jokes  He does the same 
[01:40:30]  Every joke  Oh, boy  And  Thank God Jimmy had his headphones off  Well, I didn't hear  I actually was just looking at something  No, it's okay  I think I got to move on to the next caller here  Put him through  Go ahead, Rob  Jimmy's now listening  Basically, I was just  You know  My  Batten down kids  My brother had his birthday this week  And  So he's a cancer  How appropriate  And  You know  And he's about the same age  My brother just turned 38 
[01:41:00]  And  You know  I always hated my brother  And now I know why  I  I dislike Jimmy so much  How could you not like  Little Jimmy Norton?  We all love little Jimmy  What was that?  What was that?  So who cares, dude?  Like, who cares about your brother  And what you like?  What was the point of that?  Really, Rob?  Seriously  I got to you, bro  That's what I wanted to do  You got to you?  You what?  You didn't?  Oh, my God  This guy's delusional  This is a mess all over the place  Dude, I'm actually just like  I'm chewing a bagel 
[01:41:30]  Wondering  What are you trying to do?  I'm just pulling it  Just to shake it up a little bit  Honestly, I like you very much  I'm just rubbing it around  Alright, thanks very much  Thank you  Jim, you see my desk inside in the office?  Oh  I got to you  The guy tells you about his brother  And then says he got you  What a lunatic  My brother shares a birthday  Really?  Aha! 
[01:42:00]  Let's say hi to Tom  Aha!  In Texas  Tom  Morning, guys  Morning  Hi  Hi  I have a question for Mr. Norton  Alright  Mr. Norton  Yeah  I understand you're into the scat play and all  And I know you like the big healthy log  Not true, sir  But go ahead  But I'm just wondering  Have you ever had the chance  Where a girl pops a squat on you  And instead of a nice healthy log  You get the green apple splattered  Oof  Does it A, piss you off  Sir 
[01:42:30]  B, turn you on  Or C, just  You know, go crazy  Sir  I don't know what you're talking about  I imagine it would disgust me  If I ever had a girl come over  And I gave her money to do that  And she shot a suppository out of my chest  And it bounced off  And I went  I imagine that would be really gross  That didn't happen about a year ago  I'm just saying  If it did, I would probably have been really disgusted  Alright  Very much, gentlemen  I'm punching out  Alright  Wow, looking at the believer guy  He does look like Ozzy  He really does  Wow  He really does 
[01:43:00]  Alright, alright, Ant  Um, well, other stuff we could talk about today  Because we have so much stuff to go to  We got nothing  A couple who had sex on a public school roof  Let out of jail yesterday  We'll tease that story  Because we're going to need to go to that eventually this morning  Tease it?  That's what we're teasing?  This is a good one, though  The first thing was  Jack FM does poorly in the ratings  I mean, that's 40 minutes  NASA says launch will be postponed again 
[01:43:30]  Half hour, easy  Yes  Because, you know, we do the countdown  But do it real slow  In real time  We're going to be doing the countdown  In real time on this show  I've got to tell you  I was talking to Elo last night  Like I told you  We're just shooting the shit  Talking about radio and stuff, you know  And I told them that  I'm having more fun in radio than I've ever had  Which is the truth  Yeah  I'm really enjoying this version of the Opie and Anthony show on XM, okay  And I told them  I swear it was last night  And I go  Eric, it's such a pleasure  To come into work every day 
[01:44:00]  And have plenty of stuff to go to  And talk about on a daily basis  So you jinxed it  I don't go home feeling the pressure and the stress of  Oh my god, we didn't have enough to talk about that day  Or what are we going to talk about tomorrow  It's one of those things that I don't think about anymore  I come in and Anthony and the gang  And there's just so much stuff to go to  Yeah  I had that conversation last night with him  Some days there's more than others  That's about it  It's if it's a slow news day  There wasn't really anything entertaining as far as clips go 
[01:44:30]  For, uh, on TV shows  Various TV shows that are taped  Yeah  That's what happens  We do have the box of bits  Remember, we used to go to that  Yeah, well, this is where  We should maybe do that  These are the days where we proved that we're true professional broadcasters  We can make shit out of nothing  You just sit back and watch, kid  We can make shit out of nothing  No?  Nothing out of  You said we can make shit  You're supposed to say we make something out of shit  You can make something out of shit  You're basically saying that when we have nothing  We take it and make shit out of it  Yeah 
[01:45:00]  That makes sense  I've sat in this chair on those days  Yeah, well, it's not too far off  I know I misspoke  But that's kind of accurate on its own level  We can take a good idea and spoil it  Here we go  Nathaniel's going to save the day in about 15 minutes  So I guarantee it  Macho man is busted  Who?  One of the village people  Oh, I heard about this  Yes 
[01:45:30]  Victor Willis  Who else was thinking?  You know his name  And the second I read it  Yeah, I knew Jimmy would know the guy's name  I knew the Indian's name was Felipe Rose, too  Felipe Rose  Alright, here it is  From the village people  Here it is  Macho village cop is busted  Yeah  Now, as soon as Anthony told me this  I'm laughing historically inside  I'm like, what did he get caught doing?  Right  Had to be something gay  What did you think?  I thought probably  What did you think, first thing?  I thought maybe he brought his computer in to get repaired  The guy was repairing it 
[01:46:00]  And kiddie porn spilt out of the disc  Jimmy, you want to take a stab at it?  I thought rest area  Oh, there you go  My first thought was that he like  He waved that big black gift at some undercover cop  Was he the black guy, the cop?  The cop, yeah  Victor Willis, lead singer  Oh, really?  Yes  I thought he was  Oh, it was the biker guy  The biker, I think his name was Glenn  And the construction worker  Whose name I don't remember  And then there was the Indian  And then there was the cop 
[01:46:30]  I may be forgetting  Oh, see, I thought it was the biker guy  I was confused  With the big mustache  I remember the cop  And the leather straps  That's about it  Top, Indian, construction worker  Oh, yeah, construction worker  And then there was the one with the big hog  The producer character  Who would just stand there in faded jeans  And herkin jerked all the songs  Macho, macho, man  Oh, man, we should be hitting Good Morning America this morning  What are they doing?  They're in a prime location  They're doing an ice cream segment  Oh, they're in a prime location  Ice cream consumption is highest during July and August 
[01:47:00]  It's ice cream fact  It's all the food groups wrapped up in one  I think  What is your personal favorite?  My personal favorite is actually the mint and chocolate mint  What's your favorite flavor?  What's the craziest flavor?  The craziest flavor of mint is probably drumstick  It has peanuts and cone pieces in the ice cream  What, did they have our prep sheet this morning?  I don't feel that bad about this mess anymore  Looks like it's all over town  Jesus, Good Morning America has a much bigger audience than us 
[01:47:30]  And they're asking people what their favorite ice cream flavor is  That's your favorite ice cream flavor  Oh, my God  And they have Barbara Walters filling in  Good Morning America  Where we take nothing and make shit out of it  That should be a promo  Isolate what Ed just said for a promo  Very good  It's the Matt and Katie show  It's the Matt and Katie show  The Katie show  Wow, I thought we were going bad today  That's fat  Al Roker with a big black hog  As a viewer, you're sitting home going 
[01:48:00]  Wow, what is she going to say?  What's her favorite ice cream?  What's her favorite?  What's the craziest flavor?  Craziest flavor?  That's cyanide  I'm trying to work up a Barbara Walters Depends residue joke for her favorite ice cream  Oh, damn it  But I just don't have it, unfortunately  Ow  Anyway, okay  So, Macho Village Cop is busted  And Jimmy thought some kind of rest area thing 
[01:48:30]  And what did you say again?  I thought it was going to be  Kitty porn on his computer  Oh, that's right  It's kind of boring, actually  The flamboyant ex-cop of the village people  Found himself on the wrong side of the law  With real officers  After they discovered a loaded gun  And rock cocaine in his car  Ooh  Little coke  Little crack  And a gun  Yes  The troubled former star 
[01:49:00]  Had been wanted on an outstanding warrant  For drug possession  That led to his arrest on that rap  And a subsequent search of his convertible Corvette  Which turned up the drugs and gun, authorities said  The most shocking part of this story was at the end  Why?  I knew this all along  You did?  Of course, since childhood I knew it  Oh, wow  Yeah, that is shocking  Years ago, Willis claimed  That he was booted from the outrageously costumed band  After other members revealed they were gay  He was married at the time 
[01:49:30]  The guy's not gay?  No  Or at least he alleges he's not gay  But then they got another black cop to replace him  Who looked exactly like him  Really?  Yeah  And he must have been gay  One who was probably a little more down with the program  Yeah  Yeah  A little more fun at rehearsal  Yeah  One who wouldn't actually just, you know, go left  When they went right to go to the party  You coming to the after party, daddy?  No, no, no  Just gonna go home  No, no  Hug my wife  Wife, kids  Look at pictures of the Lord  The dude was married  Yeah  Look at that  Look at that little twist  I forget the other guy's name 
[01:50:00]  We saw that coming  Hawk, maybe we can look up the other guy's name  Because Victor Willis was always my favorite  In the Navy  You can sell the seven seas  In the Navy  You can catch venereal disease  In the Navy  Bunch of fruits down on their knees  In the Navy  We pass the HIVs  It's time for your morning sing-along  We got the O.P. and Anthony program  How did they all make it? 
[01:50:30]  Did any of them die of the AIDS?  How did they make it through?  Yeah  They were all so cool  All their songs sounded exactly alike  Yeah  All these homoerotic themes  Yeah  On a ship with a bunch of men  Nothing to do but fuck  The trap  Big ship  Sailing the seas  Men  Study oceanography  With a man on his knees on the deck  Looking in the water 
[01:51:00]  Soaping up in the shower all together  Why not?  Putting jellyfish on his back  And she can sell the seven seas  In the Navy  Yeah  And she can put your mind in E  In the Navy  We're going to let this whole song play  It's a giant killer  I've got to go outside in a second  I've got to make my phone call  Oh, why are you going to do it outside?  I've got to get his number  Yeah, but can't we do it live on the show?  Because that'll kill ten minutes  Okay  I want to hear Jimmy's side of the whole interview  All right, guys 
[01:51:30]  Two hours left in the show  The O&A daily prep sheet  We did it all  Oh, no  Wow, we really stretched it, too  We did it all  You could have legitimately said  Three hours and forty minutes left  In the O&A show  And then torn this up  And no one would have questioned it  We did it all  There's more  No, there's more  Oh, you forgot  There's more pages  Small alligator found in Long Island?  Yeah, we did that story  We teased that  But why is that still on the thing  When we did that already?  What do you mean?  No, we did it  That's why I ripped that sheet off 
[01:52:00]  Oh, okay  Oh, here's this  What else are you going to say about it?  A small alligator found in Long Island?  Jesus, can you imagine if it was bigger?  Who cares?  Anybody out there have alligators found in your towns?  What's your favorite alligator?  Yeah  Do you like shirts with alligators on them?  Ha ha ha  All right  And there's nothing on the phone  So I'm hanging up on everybody again  Sorry, folks  Oh, wow  There's some cool stuff here  Damn, people  The movie orders  Look at this  Cream to play Madison Square Garden  October 23rd or 24th 
[01:52:30]  Oh, music news, Jim  Finally  New York Dolls recording a new album  That's an hour right there  An hour?  Dude, can you imagine recording a new album after you did a bunch of old ones?  That's got to be crazy, right?  It's insane  It's nuts  Rolling Stones to release a new album in September  Dude, the New York Dolls are doing one, too  That ties in with the other story  New Stained single online  There's some new music  Foo Fighters Weezer tour confirmed  Dates to be announced  There goes the music section  The leather guy died of the AIDS 
[01:53:00]  Is that what I'm hearing?  That's a shame  That was your music news  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory number one  55 million  All right  There's your movie news  We did that yesterday  So let's just throw that out  Sports Yankees in first place  Larry Brown out as coach of Pistons  Oh, shit  Kenny Rogers turns himself into police in Texas  Oh, wow  Remember that thing he did with the camera?  Right  He flipped it up  And he just turned himself into police in Texas  Yeah  In entertainment news 
[01:53:30]  Pam Anderson and Tommy Lee  To get married for the third time  Well, that's just ridiculous  I just hope he beats her savagely  He probably will  How many times do you need it, stupid?  You're the hottest chick on earth  How many times do you need it to get cracked around?  Were it?  Was?  Was the hottest chick?  I still think she's amazing  I don't know  And three times  What are they doing?  Is this a publicity gag?  Like, both their careers spiraled so badly that they  She's doing Stacked  Yeah, ooh  That's a good show  Have you seen an episode?  My good friend is on that 
[01:54:00]  Brian Scalero  Okay, so you can't bash it  I haven't seen it  But I love Brian  I love Elon  I saw an episode or two  And Tommy Lee's going back to college  So  For a reality show  So it's a timely thing  I like him  To get married again  Because then he gets all the headlines  And then his new show  Will be popping  He speaks with that hip-hop vernacular sometimes  Which I think is really cool  For like a 40-something-year-old white guy  To kind of like cross over like that  He's done with that  He's talking like a rock guy again  Oh, is he a rock guy again?  Yeah  Because your dog  He was talking like that for a while  I was like  This guy really covers all ground 
[01:54:30]  So much credibility  So there you go  We got two more entertainment news stories  We'll save for after the break  Save them, Opie  We gotta start saving  Spread the hip  It's Pam and Tommy  The little material that we have left  For the program today  Yeah  As we go to break, Anthony  We got audio  Of a mom losing it on her son  Oh  I like this  I wanted to comment on it, though  You're gonna want to comment?  I think we would  Alright, we don't have to go to break then  We'll play the tape  And then we'll stop when we have to, okay? 
[01:55:00]  Yeah  Just listen in a little bit  Alright, mom loses it on son  Get up here, pet boy  Pet battle  Whatever you do  Don't fall down  That would break my fucking heart  Well, what in the fuck  Are you waiting for?  Pet battle  Get up and over  Move it, move it, move it  Are you quitting on me?  Then quit  You slimy fucking walrus  Fucking piece of shit  Get the fuck down 
[01:55:30]  Off of my obstacle  Now  I'm gonna rip your balls off  So you cannot contaminate  The rest of the world  I will motivate you  Pack that up  Get short  Every cannibal on the condo  Alright, that one got to me  That's great  That one's really good  Very good  That was from Chris on Long Island  Good job  Alright, Jimmy is  This show is so bad today 
[01:56:00]  Yeah  Actually, it's not that bad  That Jimmy is leaving the program  To go on another show  To do another radio show  Well, I'm leaving  I have to leave early  To go to OzFest  But, uh  Dude, you're not leaving Ant-Nine  You can't leave Ant-Nine  In this mess today  I'm not leaving now  I'm not leaving a little early  What time is a little early?  What would you say?  Well, I was thinking 9-something  But I'll be 10  You were thinking 9-something?  Dude, you can't leave us  That's not a little early  That's half the show  If we're gonna eat it  We eat it together  10? 
[01:56:30]  You can't leave  But Opie, it's OzFest  He does have to go to OzFest  Because Geezer and Tony are coming this year  Which is at OzFest  And what does that entail?  You just sit around  Nine miles from here  You sit around, you eat  With them, yeah  With, uh  YSP takes good care of me  Because I'm worried that  When me and a certain person  Do interviews  A certain thing  Will cockblock us  Because again  Whatever  I'm not being hooked up  From this end  So I gotta just, uh  Yeah  Rely on the other end  No one here  No one  Is hooking this up  So, uh, you know 
[01:57:00]  I have to go through  Backward  Back me  Backwards  Uh, let's say hi  To John in Ohio  John  Yeah, you didn't need  Stuff to talk about  Uh, did y'all talk about  The, uh, Little League  Little League coach  That, uh, paid one of the players  Twenty-five dollars  To hit another player  Yeah  We, uh  A retarded player  We have ten people  We have ten people  Working for this show  And none of them  Handed in  Probably one of the best stories  To hit  In the last six months  What story is that?  Oh, well now  We gotta find it  You got the Little League story? 
[01:57:30]  Watch Eric  Little League  Confused  You have the Little League story?  I don't know  What?  What?  I was getting something else  I will get it  Oh, oh  Oh  Sounding a little  What are you getting?  Your Little League story  You weren't  What were you just getting?  The thing for Jim  The village people  He wanted the original line-up  So I was getting it  Oh, boy  But Jimmy's not even  In the studio anymore  And we were done with that  Jimmy is now, uh  Doing another radio show  Alright, well 
[01:58:00]  We'll try to find  The Little League story  That was a really good one  I just don't have it  In front of me right now  Okay, punch it out  Alright, thank you, John  Bye  It is a great story  But we gotta get  The actual  We gotta get to that one  Actual AP story  So we can go over  The details of that  Okay  Right  Alright, we'll  Step aside here  When we get back  We got the mom  Losing it on her son  Yeah, I gotta hear that  It's great, great audio  And the video is up  On opianthony.com  But the video is nothing  Isn't it?  No, I think it's just  The video camera was rolling  And kind of laying on a couch  Or something 
[01:58:30]  And it picked up the audio  And this mother  Just sounds like  A bitch  I can't imagine  Hearing her scream  You don't even look at it  From the kid's point of view  You look at it  From the guy that  Either is or was  Married to her  I can't tell if she's  Divorced or not  But just imagine  This screaming woman  Arguing with you  Divorced?  It's safe to say  She's divorced, Anthony  I mean, come on  Yeah, she seemed  Pretty, like, bitter  What man in his right mind  Is gonna, you know 
[01:59:00]  Stay with that  Deal with that  Because it's obviously  Not the first time  That she loses it like that  When you hear her scream  And just imagine it  Being directed toward you  Over some petty little thing  Right  Right, exactly  Jimmy, here's the  Original lineup of  The village people  Hawk got that for you  Yeah, there you go  Victor Willis  Felipe Rose  Who else?  David Skarhodo  Glenn Hughes  Glenn Hughes  Alex Briley  Oh, you know him?  Pretty close to Glenn Hughes  No, that's why I went  Right by that one 
[01:59:30]  Alex Briley  Who was the G.I.  Randy Jones  Oh, I forgot the G.I.  The cowboy  The soldier  The cowboy always had  Like a good way of standing  I mean  Felipe Rose, the Indian  Ray Simpson, the cop  He was the cop replacement  And Eric Anzalone  The biker replacement  Since 1995  That killed ten seconds  Why don't we have that?  Huh?  A guy paid  A little league coach 
[02:00:00]  Paid his  I know, we're trying  To find the story  Hawk is on it  But he's very irritable  Right now  Why are you irritable  I'm fine  It's just hot in here  How hot is it?  Fall into that one  What would you be falling into?  Falling into what?  Some set up  Can you look at the microphone at least?  There you go  Hi  I'm looking for your story  That's what I'm doing  Don't be talking into the mic  Do your show  Let me find the story for you  Five different blues on a shirt 
[02:00:30]  Do you want someone just to email it to you?  I'm sure  I'm sure there's ten copies of it in your email  Oh boy  Alright  We're going to move on Anthony  We're going to take a little break  Take a little break  And I want to hear the mom screaming audio  We have that  We might have to break glass today, you know  Really?  That bit over there  That just sits in the glass case  Oh, the one that sits over there  And it has a little  In case of emergency  Look, it even has a cute little axe  Above the glass box 
[02:01:00]  Yeah  So no one gets hurt  When we break the glass box  To get that bit out  So you can get in there  And get the bit that always saves us  When we're in this position  Yeah  Why not?  You might want to stay tuned  Because we might have to break glass  And get that bit out today  Alright?  Hold on  Hold on, kids  Like sand through the hourglass  So is the only day of my life  Here we go  The last tease for this  This segment, Anthony  Alright  We'll do this again  Maybe next week  You won't believe the warning 
[02:01:30]  It could be on the next can of soda you drank  Then one city wants to pack all their sex offenders  Into a three block area  Problem is  It could be right next to your house  Come on  I thought we were just going to get the soda can one again  Oh, of course not  You got to end with a good one, man  A three block area of sex offenders in your neighborhood  Oh, wow  Just whacking it  That's just the best image  Just, yeah, sitting on their porch 
[02:02:00]  Just jerking off to young children  Just panting porn off to each other over and over again  Right in your neighborhood  Everyone's fighting to open their own trench coat store  That is such a phony story  That is not happening  That would never happen  They're not packing sex offenders into a three block area in your neighborhood  It is not happening, ever  And you're the lucky fella that's the house right next to that? 
[02:02:30]  Yeah  Jesus  Can I borrow a cup of your daughter's piss?  Hi, neighbor  Howdy, neighbor  Oh, he comes to bring you a cake in a box  But he's holding it at waist level  He's encouraged you to reach your hand and foot  Howdy, neighbor  Little raccoon traps on their front lawn with Barbie dolls in them  Every house for three blocks has a little puppy in a room with no windows 
[02:03:00]  The door's always open and it says I can come in and pet him  Oh, God  Wow  Who's thinking of doing this?  Show me the politician that launched this idea  You have to, like, look at their broadcast radius  And then stand there like stupid Rocky Dennis  And  Except you're putting little pins in the map  Shaped like Flintstones shoeables  Oh, yeah, Halloween must be a real treat in that neighborhood 
[02:03:30]  Trick or  In other news  400 children turned up missing  A bunch of bloody Darth Vader costumes were found in a dumpster  Holy shit  Stick your cock through the bottom of the bowl full of that candy corn 
[02:04:00]  Grab a handful, kids  Put your hands behind your back and bob for candy  Opie and Anthony  The virus is spreading  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony program  Spreading the virus across America  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio 
[02:04:30]  Lots going on today on the program  Oh, yes  I said lots going on  I found a fun story  You did?  Yeah  It's not the animal farm again in Seattle  No, but it's close  It is yet another bestiality story  Which I personally love  I search these things out  You love bestiality?  I like the stories  They're sick and twisted  You said you personally love  I personally love  I'm going to listen to the replay now 
[02:05:00]  See what I just said  Because I don't even remember  If I just hung myself or not  It could have been taken a couple different ways  I meant it the way that means I'm not fucking animals  You love bestiality news stories  Right  That's what I meant  They're entertaining and fun to read  All right  Because I don't care  If you're reading them  You will picture the act in your head  Won't you?  Would you?  Like when that guy had sex with the horse  Well, the horse had sex with the guy  Well, at first we thought the guy was having sex with the horse 
[02:05:30]  We assumed he was screwing the horse  And that's the little picture I had in my head  And then it got worse when we found out the next day  That he had actually gotten under the horse  And let the horse have sex with him  And that's what killed him  And then if you picture that  I don't know  It gets a little more detailed  In your little picture in your mind  It's a horrific thing  By the way  That is a true story, right?  Yeah  That's not one of those urban legends  I'm still suspicious  It just sounds crazy  Like in retrospect lighting the match 
[02:06:00]  Right, right  It just sounds crazy  There was a farm somewhere  Where guys could go  Is it just guys?  Are girls going there?  I'd assume this is something  Probably guys are doing  Why?  Anytime you see a girl having sex with an animal  It's usually because she's doing it for crack  Or for a video that ends up on the internet  Why is it that the guys are all the perverts, by the way?  You never hear  I don't know  Every time one of these crazy stories hits the news  It's never a female  I think it's because chicks can pretty much get laid anytime they want  Even beastly ones 
[02:06:30]  Even weird ones  It doesn't matter  If they go out somewhere  They can get laid that night  Legit  Without having to pull out a gun  Or force somebody with a roofie or something  Yeah, so if they're a little kinky or crazy or horned up  They can do that  A guy can go years without having sex  Because they're weird or gruesome or something  So they've got to figure out alternative methods  Do you think if there was a girl in a wheelchair like Wheelchair Fred 
[02:07:00]  She would have had to have changed sexuality?  No, of course not  There would be a guy  She would be able to roll in and find a guy that night  To throw her up on a bed and have sex with her  We're cursed with sperm just being produced  Every second of the day  You know, it's just  The level just slowly but surely goes up every day  Every day  And you've got to blow off that steam  Eventually you've just got to blow snot, man  No matter what  And I guess jacking it for these guys pretty much does it 
[02:07:30]  But, you know, after years and years of jacking it  You've got to go  Hey, I need a little something extra here  Maybe a horse  I don't think you go right to a horse  I would assume you'd probably start out with smaller animals  You've got to think  Where a guy that got caught  Well, he died from it  You've got to think he might have started with dogs or something  A dog just kind of on all fours in his apartment  Let an old rover go at him  And the poor dogs  You see a male dog, you think  Eh, looks like the little fella's hung 
[02:08:00]  But then when he gets excited  And that little red lipstick thing pops out  It's like, oh  God cursed you  That was horrible  Didn't he?  And, you know, guys  I guess it's a way of blowing off that steam  Without raping or something  And, uh  Alright, so the horse story you're still saying is true  I think it's true  It sounds reasonable  It's been reported as true  It's being reported as true  No one's called it yet  I looked on Snopes 
[02:08:30]  It hasn't come up as urban legend  So  I'm just waiting for that news tease  Do you think the regular network news  Will ever carry that story?  No, of course  No way they can do it  They would probably present it  Like we were presented  With the story the first day  So you didn't know what was going on  You're going to be shocked  What your petting zoo is being used for  After hours  Dun, dun, dun  Tonight at 11  A kinky Seattle farm  Used for sex  We'll tell you about it  Sexually abused dog 
[02:09:00]  Finds a home  Now this makes me a little suspect  Blind man  Charged with misdemeanor  Lucky the guide dog  The dog's name is Lucky  Which leads me to believe  Perhaps it's a little fake  Was, uh  Allegedly sexually abused  By his blind master  But he has a new permanent home  Stacy  Uh, Cintron 22  Recent graduate of Florida State University  Has adopted the 70 pound yellow lab  They said Monday 
[02:09:30]  Lucky we'll be going to Athens, Georgia  With Stacy  Later in the week  I guess this guy  Uh, he's blind  Has a guide dog  The dog is doing the guy a favor  Of course  You know, this dog went through all the training  He's saving this guy's life on a daily basis  At street crossings  He does that thing where they stop  So the guy knows that the curve is there  Helps him out walking through doorways  And this guy's taking his guide dog home 
[02:10:00]  And fucking it  Jesus  What an ingrate  What an ass  But this seems like a guy  Who's probably having problems  Uh, getting women  I would think  If you're screwing your guide dog  I could say you're having problems getting women  So, uh  He was brought up on charges  I don't know  They don't say how he was caught  I guess he couldn't see if anyone was caught  Or where he was  There's the obvious answer  You're in the subway  Hey, now's a good time  It's in the middle of the mall  I don't know where you are  I thought I was in my room 
[02:10:30]  He pasted off  Thinking he was back in his bedroom  But he's in like  He's in the living room with company  He's in the middle of the gap  He had no idea  Where did I start pacing?  Well, maybe  I thought I was home  Maybe the dog is smarter than you think, Ant  Yeah  Maybe this was going on behind closed doors  And the dog is like  Alright, I know where this guy wants me to take him  Oh my god  I'm going to take him to the food court  In the middle of the mall  Take me to the bedroom, boy  Let's go to the bedroom, boy  Right  Bedroom, huh?  Bedroom, yeah  I'll show you the bedroom  Go to the gap  Next thing you know  He's naked with the dog 
[02:11:00]  In the middle of the mall  Pulls his pants down  Yeah, so  Well, however it happened  He did get caught  He got arrested  But  Again, another state  Florida  Has no law prohibiting sex with animals  Yeah  I did not know this  Washington state so far  And Florida  No law against sex with animals  But they find a way to charge you with something  He was charged with disorderly conduct  Now, what would that lead you to believe? 
[02:11:30]  That it was in some public place?  Yeah, it seems like it  Can you be charged with disorderly conduct in your house?  No, I don't think so  Doing something that isn't illegal?  That's got to be in a park or something, though  Yeah  According to a court document in the Tallahassee Democrats' initial story about the arrest  Lucky's whereabouts could not be confirmed  Breach of the peace by engaging in sexual activity with a guide dog  That's who he was charged with  Disorderly conduct, specifically a breach of the peace 
[02:12:00]  And they arrested him, but  He's probably going to get off on this one  That whole gag  He's probably going to get off  But he gave up the dog in the meantime  I guess a lot of pressure from the community there  And this girl adopted him  And now he's got a nice little life  She said when she put the leash on him  And went to take him away  He seemed like a puppy, even though he's nine years old  He seemed so sad at first  But as soon as I got the leash on  He was excited and bouncy and ready to get out of there 
[02:12:30]  No shit  So that's Lucky the guide dog  Happy ending for Lucky  And Eric just handed this to me  Bizarre News  Bizarre News Sweden reports increase in animal assaults  Anthony  How bizarre  The Swedish Animal Protection Agency fears animal sex abuse in the country is on the increase  More than 200 animals, mostly horses  Have been sexually molested since the 70s  According to the country's first official report into bestiality 
[02:13:00]  In all, 209 cases of animal sex have been reported in the past 40 years  Including 17 cases with cattle  18 with dogs  And more than 160 with horses  Well, when they do take that dump  And that asshole kind of puckers and moves around a little bit  Oof, it's hot  Got you thinking, right?  The society also discovered that most cases occurred after 2000  But researchers aren't sure whether people have become more likely to abuse animals  Or just more likely to report it  More likely to report it 
[02:13:30]  Yeah  Right?  Yeah, since 2000 there's more cases, they were saying?  Yeah  Yeah, I would say  Well, the phones have exploded  Let's go to Ralph  Hey, Ralph, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  You tell us  Well, two minutes too late  Carlos Mencia was just on HooHoo's show  They just got off  They went to break  Was he in studio?  Yeah, he was in studio  So he's in New York  That's highly disappointing  Yes, I know  That is highly disappointing on so many levels 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, and I know  God, you know what?  I like being the bastard children of radio  You know, the more years you do radio  You realize you just don't have many friends in this business  Nope  None whatsoever  I mean, Carlos Mencia has been doing our show for years  And he's doing well at Comedy Central  And we did a phone-in with him last week  Which was good, you know?  Yeah  But the guy's in New York  He doesn't even stop on by  That's just very, very disappointing  It doesn't take too much just to come by and see the guys, you know?  That's very, very disappointing 
[02:14:30]  Hey, I want to say happy birthday to Norton  Got to add him to the list of disappointments since we've been back on radio  Dice is right at the top of the list  Louis Black  Louis Black, Jim Brewer, Carlos Mencia  The list goes on and on  On and on and on  A bunch of disappointments  People that claim to be our friends  Dead to us  That's it  That's it  All right, boys, punch it out  Thanks for that update, buddy  No problem  You know who's a good Hollywood friend?  Jay Moore 
[02:15:00]  Jay Moore  Jay Moore, yes  Jay fucking Moore  And the fans bitched about him the most  They ragged Jay to no end  They bitched about him the most  And it turns out he, uh  Pretty much one of our only true friends  Still  That's right  Everyone else has just become traitors  Traitorous  And I understand  Rabble  I understand these guys got to do other radio shows  We're not stupid  But do ours too  Well, Louis Black, you know  He does a cute little five minute phoner with us  We used to have him on for hours  And then he finally does make it to New York  And he goes on Hoo Hoo's show 
[02:15:30]  And other people's show  Yeah  But he doesn't come in studio  Same with Carlos Mencia now  That is highly disappointing  You know who else?  Colin Quinn  Good friend  He comes in  I like Colin  And he does Hoo Hoo's show  But that's fine  But at least he comes in here  And he's genuine  But let's be honest  Do we really want him in here?  Not on a daily basis  Jesus Christ  Enough Colin  Well, you know what?  We'll continue to be successful  Doing our radio show  As we discover more people  That are just not really our friends 
[02:16:00]  Right  That's really, really disappointing  I gotta be honest with you  Very disappointing  Uh, Brian in Iowa  What's up?  Hey guys, how you doing?  Pretty good  What's going down?  Uh, wait a minute  Hold on, Brian  Two seconds  Tommy from Brookhaven  Is saying  Opie, you hung up on him  See?  I told you  You were gonna make us loose friends  But I told you guys  You can't take it personally  We only have  Nine phone lines  And when we're doing bits and stuff  Some of these lines  Are being tied up with stuff  We just know we can't go to  And it's a lot 
[02:16:30]  No, no, you hung up on Carlos  That's what he was saying  Oh, oh, oh, okay  See?  We had Carlos as a friend  And you hung up on him  If he's a true friend  He understands that gag  Everyone knows that gag  And we even explained it  After we hung up on him  Yeah  Let's say hi to Brian in Iowa  Brian?  Hey guys  Hey  I, uh, did a little research  On some of my favorite porn sites  Uh, yesterday  And I think I might have something  For you on, uh,  Where this place is located  In Washington  Okay  Really?  Yeah, bangedup.com  Awesome, awesome site 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, and really topical  For, uh, for your show too  There's always a little news story there  That would really get some, uh,  Get some, uh, good radio time  The, uh, it's in Enumclaw, Washington  It's 40 miles southeast of Seattle  Must be in the middle of nowhere  What's that?  Must be in the middle of nowhere  Well, yeah, it's gotta be  I mean, think about what they're doing out there  You know  And, uh, yeah  Enumclaw  E-N-U-M-D-L-A-W  Uh, that might be something  For your crack research team 
[02:17:30]  To work on there  All right  And no  That's all I got  Thank you, sir  Thanks, man  Chris, uh, from Boston  No, I didn't clean the horse's sheath  That was back when I was, uh, in California  I had horses  And, uh, uh, they stayed, obviously, at a stable  And there were girls there  That also had horses  And we all used to go riding together  And the girls would have to clean their horse's sheath out  And it was, uh, we'd all watch  There was a girl  She'd be, you know, 14, 15 years old 
[02:18:00]  With this huge horse cock  In her gloved hand  Picking what looked like  Beef jerky off of it  Because you'd have to clean the sheath  Or else their penis would get, uh, infected  Tell me more  They would take a hose  And shove it up into the sheath  And just crap would come pouring out  And then they would take their gloved hands  Their little gloved hands  Pull the horse cock out  No shit  And scrub it down  Of course, that big smile on his face 
[02:18:30]  I'm gonna go out on a limb  And say that horses aren't getting a lot of BJs  No, you could probably not be going out on a limb  If you're saying that  Alright, Chris in New York, what's up?  Hey, boys  Hey  Hi  Did you guys, uh, hear that Monsters  Are gonna start the, uh, assault on the media now?  Monsters out of Florida  Of course they're going to do it  Of course  When we started this assault on the media  With the TV and the signs and stuff  Anthony and I talked and said  You know what?  This bit is gonna be taken by every schmuck in radio 
[02:19:00]  It's a no-brainer  Every schmuck in radio  That's why we don't hang with radio guys  And, and you know what?  You know, fair is fair  Howard had a legitimate point  When he started talking about how, how, uh, you know  Radio rips him off and stuff  But then he become, then he became a parody  And, and, you know  And now no one's really believing him anymore  Because now he just is convinced  Everyone rips off every single thing he does  And that's not true  But, but, you know  He has a legitimate complaint  You know, radio is filled with a bunch of scumbags 
[02:19:30]  That aren't creative  Don't know how to come up with their own bits  And they just troll the internet  And troll other radio sites  Troll other, you know, show sites  Yeah  Uh, the regular guys in Atlanta  They're, they're guilty of this  We know for a fact  They were, uh, checking out our website  Every single day  Coming up with bits  And just throwing them on their show  The next day  And this isn't  Don't bash them, Opie  We share an agent  And this isn't the who-who stuff  This is, uh, this, this is a fact  Right  And now, of course, someone is going to start doing assault on the media  The way we do it 
[02:20:00]  Of course they're going to do that  They're a bunch of scumbags  Vultures  Attack  Buzzards  Attack the monsters of the midday  Please  Sick them  Let's hear what silliness they have to say about us  And this assault on the media  They'll look stupid  I guarantee it  Joe in, uh, Jersey  What's up?  Good morning, guys  Hey  Listen, uh, I'm in my work truck  So I'm listening to a woo-hoo  And, uh, lo and behold  As you know, Carlos McTier is on  Now here's the interesting 
[02:20:30]  Wait, hold on, Joe  Was he in studio?  I'm sorry?  Was, uh, Carlos definitely in studio?  Yeah, he was definitely there  Highly, highly disappointing  Howard wouldn't have him on the phone  Highly, highly disappointing  As we sit here  Day in and day out  Without guests  And then  Then people that we consider  Friends of the show  They can't even stop in  Yeah  Live  Because there's a big difference  Between getting someone on the phone  And someone in studio, by the way  Maybe to you, the listener  It's not a big deal  I don't know  Yes, there's a huge difference  But it's really important  To have these guys in studio with us 
[02:21:00]  Go ahead, Joe  Alright, well  Here's the only point  Uh, Carlos is talking about  How, like, guys like  Paul Rodriguez  And, you know, all the other Latin comics  All, you know  Saying that  Mencia's, like, ripping them off  And doing all this  And Stern starts in by going like  Uh, yeah, you know  That's the way it goes  They think that, you know  Every beaner's gotta tell  A new Taco Bell joke  Sometimes you guys gotta share material  Do the same thing  I found it very ironic  Because this is the same guy  That bitches and moans  Whenever, like, you know  You guys get samples 
[02:21:30]  Or whatever you guys call it  It's like the whole industry  Uses these  And Captain Wu  Yeah, I run the world on this stuff  Turned into one of the biggest  Radio  The Howard guy  Until, you know  I finally got my XM at Christmas  And, you know  Lucky I got you guys back  Oh, you missed so much  Yeah  Oh, yeah  I think everyone, by the way  Is hypocritical  But there's  There's many, many stages of it  And I think Howard has  Got to the point of  Being ridiculous  Oh, yeah  With his hypocrisy 
[02:22:00]  Ever since  I tell you, man  It began when Allison left him  And when Allison left him  He got weird  And then he started  Not being that guy  That I could identify with anymore  Then he turned into  This fucking millionaire  That no one could appreciate  And then the Janet Jackson thing  Dude, he's too busy  He's too busy getting  Hair weaves  And Botox injections  Well, I guess  How can you relate to that guy  How can you relate to a guy  That's getting Botox  In his face  Unfortunately, dude  I'm 25 in Jersey  And I drive a truck  I fucking can't 
[02:22:30]  I can identify with the guy  That used to stall air conditioning  Yeah  Oh, sorry  Alright  Well, boys, I'm sorry  I'm about to get into an accident  So keep it real  Keep it metal  Therefore.com  Alright, let's go to Bubba in Oklahoma  Bubba  What's going on, boys?  Hey, what's up?  I work for a company in Nebraska  We haul a livestock  And one of our drivers  Allegedly got fired  For putting a sow  In the corner of the trailer  And was fucking it  A sow?  He was fucking a pig?  Yeah  And he got fired?  Yeah 
[02:23:00]  Allegedly, man  You know  I say allegedly  Because I know  There's about six of my buddies  That are probably listening right now  Man, I don't  We gotta eat this stuff  God, they're fucking our food  I know  At least pull it out  And aim for the pig's face  What?  Jimmy  Steps up and knocks one out of the park  Jesus, Jimmy  I had to be clean for 15 minutes  Oh, that's tough  Yeah  And we were just hitting singles  After, you know  A single, single here  Yeah, just trying to, you know  Keep the guys going around the base 
[02:23:30]  And had a double off the wall, you know  And then you step up to the plate  And hit it out of the park  Nice  Dude, I just did 15 clean minutes  I had to get a load in the face joke out  Yes  But what goes through your mind?  You know, you're there  You're naked with a hard-on  Maybe a Viagra hard-on or something  I don't care how psychopathic  And then you got a sheep or a pig in front of you  And what goes on in your head  Right before you decide  I'm going to do this  Well, at first you start thinking like  Well, I'm lonely  And I probably shouldn't be doing this  But then again you start thinking  The animal's a little bit lonely  Look how fat this thing is 
[02:24:00]  Maybe the other animals don't fuck it  Ah, let him lick it a little bit  Next thing you know  You're inside  He's squealing  Maybe he likes it  I say he because  Well, if you knock one up  That's kind of embarrassing  He's a little pig with a weak chin flying out  We know whose that is  It's a crew-cutted little pig  By the way  I got some very disappointing information  As you were doing your phone call  What, what?  Carl Schmitz  Who we had on the phone, what, last week?  Yeah  Who truly has been a friend of our show for a few years  Absolutely  He's in studio with Who Who today 
[02:24:30]  Yeah  Well, in studio  Another, another quote  Friend  Proving that he's really not a friend  Yeah, the beaner shit's run its course anyway  Please stop  That's highly disappointing  So we added him to the list with Dice, Brewer, Lewis Black, and now Carl Schmitz  Not because he did Howard  Guys that personally called me talking about how we're friends and this and that  Thank you for everything you've done for my career and this and that  And then the first chance these guys get, boom, bye-bye 
[02:25:00]  And it's not even about doing the other show or doing Howard Show  It's about not coming in studio here  Right  It's about  We said that  We understand the game that these guys, including yourself  You just had to do it and you're part of this show  You have to do all the radio shows  We understand that  You're promoting your product  But it's an insult to us when you do a phone with us and you're supposedly a friend  Now you're in New York City and you're not stopping by to say hi  Absolutely  It's ridiculous  And then we defended Jay Moore because Jay Moore got a lot of shit from the listeners  You know, oh, he's not a friend of the show, blah, blah, blah  It turns out he's the biggest friend of the show and he never bailed on us 
[02:25:30]  Dude, Jay just calls in once in a while to bullshit the Keitel impressions  How phenomenal is that?  I know  And if he has something to plug, he'll plug it  But especially lately, he has nothing to plug  He's still calling our show, you know  Dice was at Caroline's and he does not even a phone call  Not even a, you know, he doesn't even stop on by  I'm sure Dice will be fine with his career without us  But it's just very, very disappointing  Rogen's a great friend  I mean, look, Rogen will call up once in a while  And what's he doing when we're out there?  He does an hour and a half to two hours  Or the whole show, actually  He did, I think, almost four hours he did 
[02:26:00]  And really, he just talked about gorilla fucking that guy's girlfriend  And really upset him  He's a good shit  Yeah, because a guy like Rogen has fucked that poker player's girlfriend for his entire life  And that's the problem  That's where I got to get mad at  This coming in, someone else is ripping off the assault on the media  Texas Rangers' Kenny Rogers  Yeah, and that's the other thing that we found out  We just had a very interesting 20 minutes of radio here  Not a lot of laughs, but interesting stuff  And it turns out the Monsters of the Midday down in Florida  They're now ripping off the assault on the media  And when we started this, we knew 
[02:26:30]  Because, I mean, you know, this is where we definitely agree with Howard  That the business is filled with a bunch of unoriginal scumbags  Scumbags  It's funny, we got some good plugs on Robert, too  He was not afraid, you gotta love this guy  He's not afraid to talk about the show  He's like, hey man, how are Opie and Anthony doing?  How's the show going?  He knows we're on XM  And we're kind of competing  I mentioned the fucking 24-hour replay  It was actually a fine little plug for XM  Very good  I care  You do 
[02:27:00]  I'm a good boy  Alright, well  Let's say hi to Rene in Seattle  Rene?  Yeah, there's actually a video going around on the net  Of a guy getting fucked by the horse  He bends over  Two guys guide the already  Shut up, where's the video?  We gotta see it immediately  Alright  Eatabullet.com?  No, it's...  Go to E-L-L-L...  Hold on, hold on, hold on  Off air, my friend  Yeah, we'll do it off air  This is a hot topic, everyone's gonna wanna know  Hot? 
[02:27:30]  We'll give out the website after we view it  He's right  It's very hot  I've seen the women with the horse video.  Donkeys, things like that.  They've seen that.  That's pretty sick.  And they do.  They need, like, a couple of guys that guide it in.  It's like they're carrying an I-beam, and they just kind of, like, get it right in there.  They both got it, like, under their arms.  And then whammo.  It's the Glenn and Tony show.  The Glenn and Tony show.  That's very funny. 
[02:28:00]  Clock Tower from whackbag.com.  Clock Tower.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey.  My buddy used to work vice down here in Houston, and we recently learned how deep the commitment goes with these bestiality folks.  For example, with a horse, you can't just pick up any fine filly in the field.  They take one.  It takes about a month to train.  The whole time they're washing it, brushing it, playing with its cock, just making sure it's not going to freak out.  Making it comfy.  Oh.  Exactly.  It takes about a month to get one train just right so it won't freak out and kill you the first time, you know. 
[02:28:30]  You get going on it.  Yeah, there's nothing worse to kill the mood when you're trying to suck a horse's dick than when it whinnies.  Shh.  Oh, don't.  Yeah, dogs, pigs, the same.  Yeah, how do you break down a horse where he's going to be comfortable?  Yeah.  It's tough enough to break him down so you can get a damn saddle on him.  So you can ride him.  Right.  You have to put something in his mouth just so he doesn't throw you off.  How do you get in the standstill when you're toot on its mule for a few minutes? 
[02:29:00]  They start washing him every day while he's brushing, petting, and sooner or later he just kind of calms down and they start working down to his cock.  Sooner or later you're washing his cock every day and that's what he gets used to, just having hands around his cock.  Otherwise he'd just freak out.  That's pretty much the way it is when your baby sits.  Jimmy, I hate that I have to do this, but it is your birthday.  Oh, I'm 37.  It is your birthday.  Happy birthday.  And you were setting up your interview with Rover at what station were we on? 
[02:29:30]  923 Extreme in Cleveland and a few other stations.  And tickets are going well for your shows up there.  Yeah, I'm very happy.  Why don't you get a plug-in for your birthday?  Oh, this Saturday.  I think there's like 40 tickets left on the late show.  Early show is sold out quickly, late show.  So if you want to go to Ticketmaster at Cleveland Odeon this Saturday.  This just in.  Jimmy just wanted to tell a little Jimmy that on 92.3 here in Cleveland they have been giving away tickets to callers.  They give people the option of three choices.  One is your show, July 23rd at the Odeon. 
[02:30:00]  Most people have been taking the tickets to your show.  And what are the other two?  Robert Reed's blood and a photo of Pat Battle's asshole.  Well, now the photo of Pat Battle's asshole.  Houston Oilers fullback, 1974.  Pat Battle.  Earl Campbell.  So, well, that's what I'm getting at, by the way.  I don't get the Pat Battle thing.  I'm going to go on record and say I hate it.  It's all the rave. 
[02:30:30]  I understand it's taken on a life of its own.  Her name itself is funny.  And we played one as you were setting up your interview.  So, I guess because it's your birthday, I want you to hear this one that you missed, okay?  Get up here, Pat Boy!  Pat Battle!  Whatever you do, don't fall down!  That would break my fucking heart!  Well, what in the fuck are you waiting for, Pat Battle?  Get up and over!  Move it, move it, move it! 
[02:31:00]  Are you quitting on me?  Then quit, you slimy fucking walrus-looking piece of shit!  Get the fuck down off of my obstacle!  Now!  I'm going to rip your balls off so you cannot contaminate the rest of the world!  I will motivate you!  Pat Battle!  If it shark dicks every cannibal on the Congo!  Wow!  You did a pretty good job, right?  Dude, I've got to say, Hartman was hot under the collar. 
[02:31:30]  Oh.  A little bit, a little bit.  Whoa, was that great?  Just standing there.  And he even had good posture on the top of that obstacle.  Just screaming.  With his perfectly cut body.  Just...  He's all V'd out.  Screaming at that fat man to get down.  All right.  Some trouble if you have credit cards, people.  It's just in.  Oh, let's tease it.  Let's tease it.  Oh.  Let's tease it.  Oh, like the news.  Yeah, tease it, Ant.  Trouble.  Look, I was trying to scare people.  Yeah, tease it.  Trouble if you have credit cards.  How is this going to affect you? 
[02:32:00]  We'll tell you after the break.  We don't do that on the news.  We should have more integrity than we have.  Mark that one down, boys.  All right.  Well, we got that.  Oh, shit.  I hold in my hand.  Yes.  Oh.  It'd be what?  Bombs and Flubs.  Volume 2.  Volume 2.  From Nathaniel.  Hey, I see my name on there a little more this time, Nathaniel. 
[02:32:30]  You stink.  I'm only on once under Flubs.  Stop it.  It's all about Jimmy and Anthony today.  How could you only be on once?  I don't know.  How did I escape that?  Your nickname is Frank Flub.  How did I escape this?  Judy Blume wrote a novel about you.  It was called Flubber.  Wow.  There was another one about you.  Are you there, dog?  It's me, Margaret.  I'm going to enjoy the next segment of the Opie and Anthony program.  Damn it.  Because I could sit back and just enjoy the uncomfortableness that you guys are going to feel. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, border battle.  Border battle on the news.  All right.  Bombs and Flubs, Volume 2 on the way.  And, oh, yeah, we still haven't played the audio of the mom losing it on her son.  Jeez, it is fucking...  Do we not pay the air conditioning bill in this place?  It is brutal.  Blazing hot in here.  Do we not turn the air up?  Is it possible?  Who'd you tell?  Mars.  What's Mars doing?  Yeah, just keep that door open and turn down all the XMs around the joint.  Because we've got to do the rest of the show with that door open.  Is Mars turning the air on?  I'm sure he is.  He's looking at the thermostat right now. 
[02:33:30]  Did you turn it off or on?  The fan was...  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  I tell you, when I went to the dentist yesterday on Long Island, I was so grateful that I had  quit smoking, just because I had very good teeth. 
[02:34:00]  Good teeth, Jimmy.  Well, Jimmy Norton takes care of his teeth.  I had still some staining from smoking.  Yellow staining, was that?  Yeah, from urine.  Why?  I don't understand what this one is.  I forget it.  Just, you know, wipe it off.  You like chocolate keg a lot, don't you?  Oh, my God.  Your teeth are so clean.  Do you rinse with ammonia or some sort?  Because that really cleans your teeth.  But she told me I had great bone.  They do this weird test on your teeth.  It's really uncomfortable to get the x-rays.  They take like 30 x-rays of your mouth. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  And then she puts this little thing, and it goes, three, one, two, one, over each tooth.  They actually put a thing between your tooth and gums real quick, and they measure the  distance to make sure that your teeth and gums are between each part of your teeth and  the gums.  Yeah.  Why are you explaining something that everyone goes through?  You mean you've actually done that?  Oh, my.  Everyone in their cars right now are like, you're explaining a teeth examination.  You're explaining a visit to the dentist.  You idiot.  I've gotten to me.  How long has it been?  A couple years. 
[02:35:00]  You were explaining that like you're the only person that's ever been through it.  They take pictures.  They take 30 x-rays.  No.  He actually said it takes 30 x-rays, and they're very uncomfortable.  Wow.  And they take this instrument and go, one, two, two, three, two, three, three, one, two,  three, three.  I never had that before.  And then they take this thing.  It's like a fishing line.  And they actually go in between your teeth.  All right.  Stop it.  No.  There's a small little toilet bowl next to me that the water goes down it in a swirl, 
[02:35:30]  and you spit into it.  And they give you fluid, but they don't want you to drink it.  You rinse, and they want you to waste this lovely beverage.  No, I understand.  Guys, it's really weird.  They start by putting a bib on you.  Oh, stop it.  I'm like ready to eat, but it's really heavy and filled with sand and lead.  This isn't for food.  Why are you running out of the room?  I really don't take a good picture.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Well, well.  Cody and Anthony, the virus is spreading. 
[02:36:00]  I'm waiting for you.  There's a dark and dark.  Always dreaming up on you.  All right.  Happy birthday to little Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy's going to be abandoning us soon.  Yeah, he's going to go down to OzFest for the day.  And, uh, and yeah. 
[02:36:30]  And that's that.  That's all right.  Let him have fun on his birthday.  Anyway, where is Jimmy?  Because we want to do one more segment here before we move on to other things.  We could do the Mom Losing It on Son, or we could do Bombs and Flubs Volume 2.  Yeah.  Where's Jimmy?  Oh, he's doing a little bathroom break.  Okay.  Oh, I didn't do my credit cards.  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead.  Oh, danger.  Warning.  Do you have any?  Do you have any, like, regular credit cards or just, like, American Express? 
[02:37:00]  I'm pretty much down to American Express.  Just Amex?  Pretty much, yeah.  Yeah.  I got, like, one MasterCard just because.  Well, I got that, too, but.  Sometimes places don't take American Express.  I'm only, like, charging about, I don't know, like $10,000 a month on that.  That's it?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's like nothing.  Drop in the bucket.  Now people are going to be posted.  You know, I hope he doesn't understand.  $10,000 is a lot of money.  Shut up, you freaks.  Shut up.  I got an American Express, actually, a black card.  You do?  Yeah.  No way. 
[02:37:30]  Wow.  What does that get you?  Um, nothing.  Oh.  Let me see your black card.  Well, it wasn't black when I got it, but I just colored it.  It was a discover.  I wrote American Express.  You just wrote American Express on it.  And I put, like, duct tape over it.  Yeah.  It gets me a lot of things.  Well, uh-oh.  That'll work.  Oh, no.  What's the matter?  I get scared of my birthday.  Oh, you're a little nervous?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, boy.  He's scared. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, God.  What happened, Jimmy?  I just thought of all my presents that were piling up, and I got frightened.  I hope people come to my party.  That one sounded like one of mine.  Yeah, it sounded kind of wet.  Yeah, you usually don't have it.  With a hint of millionaire.  I start farting around 930, and usually I push really hard, and they usually sound like that.  I tell you, I want to have a birthday party with a pony, except I want the pony to be like it is in that video we saw. 
[02:38:30]  Wow.  That is the most horrific thing I've ever seen.  Is it even legal for us to be viewing that?  Yeah, legal and hot.  Let any judge out there.  What are you going to do?  Let me see if a judge watches that, if he doesn't have a little tent in his robe.  Look, in this context, it is journalism.  It's news.  It's news.  I don't want to jerked off to it.  Yeah, why not?  That was pretty disturbing.  It was a guy, and he's standing there, and a horse is behind him. 
[02:39:00]  The horse jumps up on something.  They have to have some kind of apparatus.  Yeah.  Because the horse wants to jump up like it's mating with another horse, so it's got to take its front legs and kind of take its chest and its front legs  and put it up on top of another horse.  A guy can't support that weight, and the horse wants to do that when it's getting laid.  So I guess there's some kind of a fence in front of this guy or platform or something that the horse is able to jump up on.  The guy is underneath it, just kind of hunched over a little bit, and another guy is guiding the horse's unit right into the guy's bunghole. 
[02:39:30]  And at first, he's kind of holding by the tip, so he's just getting about eight inches of it or so.  I mean, the tip of this thing is like a bell.  Yeah, huge.  And then we think it's just going to be that.  The guy's kind of just taking a little bit of it.  Then the horse just goes, wham, and slams it home all two feet.  It's like two feet long. 
[02:40:00]  And just goes to town on this guy.  Where does that go?  Dude.  You see, it's like two feet lift up.  Where does it go?  Does it end up in your small intestine?  Seriously, where does it go?  I would think it probably just bunches up your intestines and just is in your abdomen somewhere.  Because the horse, it was funny.  It was almost like you could hear the horse going, let me just put the head in.  Yeah.  And like you do with a chick.  And all of a sudden, the horse's little legs scooched forward quickly. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, yeah.  He just ran forward.  Pow, pow.  And buried the whole thing.  The old one, too.  Pow, pow.  Is that the guy that died?  I mean, it should be, if it isn't.  Who knows?  Because I was saying off air that that guy, somebody sits next to him in a cubicle at work  and has no idea that the night before, he had the cock of a horse buried in him.  Someone has to say to that guy, is that your stapler?  Can I borrow that?  And he goes, yeah, but just give it back.  Sure.  And he's sitting there and his asshole is bleeding because a horse fucked it.  The government should just execute people randomly for that. 
[02:41:00]  Maybe he's in the restroom taking a dump and he's sitting there and someone, another co-worker  is talking to him as he's wiping and there's just blood and he's got to sit there like  a normal human being.  A dump.  Carry on a conversation.  As he swallows food, it just falls out of him.  Oop.  Plink.  Oop.  Plink.  Let's say hi to Rich Voss.  Rich, what's up?  Happy birthday.  Thank you, man.  By the way, the footage was excellent. 
[02:41:30]  What footage?  Of you and the horse.  You know what's funny?  How you say the nerve of him at work?  The nerve of you, you're sitting there knowing that a log was dropped on your chest the other  night.  That's not true.  It's not true?  No.  Oh, you don't do that anymore?  I never did that, wink.  Oh.  Happy birthday.  What are you doing?  Thank you.  I'm leaving here in a couple minutes to go on to Ozfest with Florentine.  How old are you?  Uh, oh, dude, I've been getting big laughs with this all week.  Someone says, how old are you?  I say, 29 again.  Ah, see, now that's hysterical.  I'm 37, Rich.  37? 
[02:42:00]  Wow.  Same as your waist size.  Uh, nothing.  They told me to call.  There'd be a mean guy.  Well, that was mean-spirited because...  I can't be mean because it's your birthday.  First of all, I don't even like doing the thing.  Hey, Rich, I'm losing weight.  I can't help it, but working out, you know?  I know you look good.  I didn't, I don't want to say anything mean because it's your birthday and it's your day.  Thank you.  All right, Rich.  It's your day and I hate calling in.  Where are you?  I'm at home.  I'm going, uh, I got nothing.  You on Ozfest?  No, I'm not going to Ozfest.  Are the Allman brothers playing there? 
[02:42:30]  Ugh.  All right, Rich.  Goodbye.  Bye.  Bye, Voss.  Voss has the worst taste in music.  Well, do we have time to do Bombs and Floods before you get out of here?  I think so.  I got to be out of here in six minutes.  Not even.  Well, if your credit card payment.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, my crack itches.  We could get the mom loses it on her son before we leave.  Yeah, you can get some of the, uh.  In case you continue the show with your cell phone.  It's too hot.  It's hot in here.  Are you going to take, like, a cab and stuff?  I'm going to take a cab, but I got to go downstairs.  I got to go upstairs and grab my photos that I have, just in case I meet some of my heroes. 
[02:43:00]  They'll sign it.  And, um, uh, then I got to go into the car and leave and meet Jimmy.  All right, so when you leave the studio, just get on the cell phone.  You can't leave us with this mess today.  Why?  You get the show's kicking ass.  Yeah, but it'll be fun.  Like, all of a sudden, you jump in.  Having fun now.  Well, I'm not going to be here alone.  You jump in with a cab.  What?  I'm leaving someone here for you.  Who?  Well, you know, we can all do the show together.  Liddy!  Hey.  Liddy will be here to cover for me.  Well, that's, that solves the problem right there.  That's right.  How about, uh, no, you got to call from your cell phone. 
[02:43:30]  Jumping in a cab.  If it stinks, it stinks.  It could be fun.  The little banter you have with the cabbie, you know.  Stuff like that.  Yeah, I got to give up my address to them.  Sure, everybody can hear that.  And then all the girls can line up with cock on their minds.  That's right.  All right, Mom loses it.  Palatial Jimmy Estates.  Get up there into your palatial mansion that you have.  That's right.  Yeah.  I finally got this stuff off the floor, by the way, thanks to...  You did?  Donkey sausage.  I hired her.  And, uh, she's been there for like four days trying different combinations and stuff. 
[02:44:00]  And it looks like it's really fun.  It worked.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, uh...  Good for you.  We're Steve.  We need the backstory on this.  Steve, get in here.  On this audio.  Mom loses it on son.  Mm-hmm.  The video's up on opianthony.com, but you can't really see anything because it's just a video  camera that was left behind.  Yeah, the audio.  This woman just sounds miserable.  Well, we could start as Steve makes his way into the studio.  Listen to this lady.  Lady.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Why are you doing this shit? 
[02:44:30]  All I said was ask me...  No, you're not fucking me up, Taylor.  I said I'm...  Give me your fucking card so I can use it.  Ask me nicely.  No!  Why can't you ask me nicely?  Stick it up your fucking ass.  I asked you nicely 10 minutes ago now and get real good.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  You've got to be kidding me.  She's upset.  Steve, what's the story on this?  I guess it's a mother yelling at her son.  He left the camera rolling because he must know that she's prone to these outbursts. 
[02:45:00]  This is great that these kids are just hanging their parents out to dry with these videos and recordings.  Yeah.  We had the one of the son that got picked up by the father and the father's just yelling at him.  Still one of my favorite things.  Ends up on the internet.  And now this raging lunatic woman yelling at her son.  I'm going to defend her a little bit.  Why?  Well, you're not allowed to hit your kids anymore.  So what else are you going to do?  Scream like a lunatic?  Would your mom scream like that at you?  She would give you a shoe across the face and then guess what? 
[02:45:30]  End of discussion.  There were a couple of times my mother just would go off like a lunatic like this.  But then she would get so upset she would bite her hand.  She would go, oh!  She would put her, like, and it was like completely straight.  It wasn't like bite your knuckle.  Take your hand and put your fingers together, all together, and just hold it flat.  Okay.  Like level with the ground.  And now put your index finger in your mouth and just go, oh!  She would do that.  Who's your mother, Colin Quinn? 
[02:46:00]  Exactly.  Colin.  I've seen Colin do that.  I do that, actually.  I bite the index finger really hard.  No more biting.  And then I bite in between my bicep and my shoulder muscle.  Why?  Right here in that soft spot.  Where do you bite?  Really hard.  Why would you do that?  All right.  Relax.  No, no.  I'm asking you.  Jesus.  What?  If you bite between your biceps, that is dangerous.  Why?  You can't.  Because a bicep is...  I didn't say bicep.  Did I?  Yeah.  Oh, God. 
[02:46:30]  I'll be the star of Volume 3.  Did I really say that one?  No.  I didn't even catch that one.  Yeah, you did.  All right.  Bicep.  Of course, Danny Dixon caught it.  Oh, he already marked it down, those motherfuckers.  They're working against us now in that room.  He flexes like that, though.  Just when it opens, showing something.  That bicep just comes out.  All right.  Anyway.  Oh, this is not disturbing outside the studio.  Yeah, who is this guy?  He's a guy that...  He came in looking like Crocodile Dundee.  He wants to hand out flyers in Times Square.  I ain't got time to bleed. 
[02:47:00]  We can't get the hot chicks to do it, but we'll get this man.  Oh, we got this maniac that is...  Oh, thank you very much.  He's holding it up.  It says, happy birthday.  Jim Norton.  Jimmy.  Thank you.  And Anthony on the back.  Okay.  Back to the mom losing it on the set.  Oh, right.  So your mom would freak out a little bit, Anthony.  Yeah, she would freak out, but...  Yeah, she tried hitting me, but it just didn't work out.  Like, my father used to hit me, and then when he moved to California, the hitting just stopped  because she hit me once when I was a little kid, and the strap, the tip of the strap 
[02:47:30]  hit the tip of my penis, and it swelled up, and I had to put ice on it, and she never  hit me with the strap again.  Yeah.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Are you serious?  Yeah, I was trying to get out of the way.  Like, I ran to the bunk bed, and I'd always run to the bottom bunk because it's hard to  swing the strap in there, you know?  But she kind of went to swing it, kind of sidearm to get in there, and the tip of the 
[02:48:00]  strap went right around my waist, and the tip of the strap hit the very tip of my little  wiener.  How do you ice down that area?  I jumped up like a chicken without a head.  I was screaming bloody murder in my room, grabbing, going, ah!  And my mother flipped out.  She lost her mind.  She thought she killed me.  Did you feel ashamed?  She threw it, of course, afterwards.  Dirty.  Of course.  And she was like, what did I do? 
[02:48:30]  She freaked out.  And then got some ice and told me to put the ice on it.  So I put ice on it, and that was the last time she ever tried to hit me with anything.  You should have made her put the ice on it.  Yeah, you put the ice on it.  You don't stop my mom from spanking me, because I used to get hit, too.  One time she put me over her knee, she took a paddle, and then she swatted me.  I came on her leg.  Show her.  All right, back to the audio.  And I'm not going to all fucking tear this room apart and fucking find it.  You'll be one sorry, kid. 
[02:49:00]  I don't have time.  I'm going to get back to work.  You know that one second.  Ask me nicely.  Fucking bastard.  You hear him?  Ask me nicely.  Ask me nicely.  Okay, the kid's being a prick.  Of course, because he knows he's got gold for his friends.  The mother is a witch, though.  And this is why I go back to the, you know, she's not going to hit him.  He knows that.  So now he's like, oh, I'm going to tape this for my friends.  And then he knows what buttons to push.  Yeah.  But you know why I can't sympathize with her? 
[02:49:30]  Because you know she uses the same tactic with the husband, boyfriend, whatever it is.  Aren't there references to this?  Aren't there references to, like, child support made in this?  Oh, really?  Okay.  I think so.  I didn't hear that.  If you look at the footage, you will see, like, an Xbox and TV and a lot of electronics.  And he's obviously got his own camcorder, so he's recording this.  So he might be a relatively, you know, spoiled kid who knows how to push his mom's buttons and his mom's...  As soon as I heard this, I said, divorcee.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No doubt in my mind.  No doubt. 
[02:50:00]  God, I've got to get back to work!  You know that one second!  That's too nice, babe.  Fucking bastard.  Fucking racist!  Fucking roast!  Fucking car!  Give me that goddamn car now!  Who the...  What car is she looking for?  I guess she's looking for a credit card for the gas.  I bet you it's a credit card.  I think she said she ought to get gas to go to work.  And, uh, it's probably a credit card.  So I'll just use cash.  For all you know, it's her credit card. 
[02:50:30]  Could you imagine standing there and having that yelling at you during an argument?  I w...  I...  I'd be...  I'd be in prison.  You'd have to kill that to make it stop.  Whew.  Fucking house!  Fucking car!  Give me that goddamn car!  Cut your car now!  Ask me nicely.  Fuck off, you bastard.  Fuck off!  Get the fuck out of my house!  No, now you're getting on.  Get out of my fucking house! 
[02:51:00]  No, that...  You!  No!  You pay the fucking bills!  I can't get my ass to work!  You get out and pay these fucking bills!  Get ass nicely!  Fuck off!  You're all fucking head games, you little 16-year-old piece of shit!  You better be fucking out of my house than I do hope for work today at 11 o'clock!  Because if you're fucking in here, you're getting up and you're getting your fucking ass,  honey!  I'll call child support and you can go fuck yourself.  You can call your fucking father and we'll live with him!  How about that, you little son of a bitch?  Oh, okay, he said, I'll call child support. 
[02:51:30]  He probably meant child welfare, child services.  He's threatening her.  And then call your father, okay, so they don't live together.  Hmm.  There's problems there.  Wow.  You can call your fucking father and we'll be with him!  How about that, you little son of a bitch?  You just turned this whole fucking 15-minute goddamn conversation!  I asked you to ask nicely.  Fuck off!  I asked you nicely when I came in here! 
[02:52:00]  You little jerk off!  Oh, well.  You're a little head game, spoiled rotten brat!  You're gonna fucking learn about life real fucking quick!  You should learn about life, okay?  Because your fucking bills won't be paid, Mr. Man!  Never mind.  Mr. Man!  Get that fucking card now!  I have to go to work!  No, I don't care now because you're a bitch.  You come here and threaten me out.  You know what?  Forget it.  Get out.  Go away.  You're not getting it now.  You should have asked nicely.  See, this shows our age, I gotta tell you, because I can't even, I can't even imagine 
[02:52:30]  getting in my mom's face like this.  I can't even, on any level, imagine it.  It's not a mother-son relationship right there.  That's like a...  But I think it shows our age.  I think this is going on a lot more than we realize.  Really?  I think so, man.  I think Ope's right.  There's a whole generation of kids that are raised with the concept of the time-out.  There's no more beatings.  There's just, you know, you get a time-out.  So you gotta thrash these little bastards.  I see some of the little kids in my family, and they get a time-out, and you see it in  their eyes like, pfft, whatever. 
[02:53:00]  This is nothing.  Time-out.  Ooh, I'll sit in another room for a little while.  Gonna stand on my head.  To make you happy.  You know?  And I understand.  I'm not questioning parenting.  It's what is going on these days, like Steve said.  The threat of the smack, the belt.  Well, you brought up a good point.  Like, when you and Joe would act up, your dad would come to the bedroom and just, what,  leave the belt?  Hang the belt on the doorknob.  First, there were threats yelled from the living room.  And then if we didn't quiet down and go to sleep, because we'd be yapping, and they'd 
[02:53:30]  hear us, and he'd be like, shut up in there!  Go to sleep!  And you're trying to go to sleep, and then you start talking.  And then he goes, don't make me get the belt.  And he would take his belt off and hang it on the doorknob.  And if we were yapping too much, he'd come in.  He never actually did it.  I think that was just the threat.  We got hit with the belt, but it was for, like, real stuff, more than just talking.  But the threat of that thing hanging on the doorknob like that, it was just a constant  reminder, like a hangman's noose. 
[02:54:00]  We didn't, then we shut up.  We talk about it on the show a lot.  It's the fear.  Yeah.  It's not necessarily something actually happening.  They put the fear in you.  They put the fear in you.  And we knew what that belt felt like because we had been hit with it.  Exactly.  So just the threat of it was enough to contain us.  But it wasn't an idle threat.  You knew what it felt like to get whacked with that thing.  You know, you ever get shoved down the steps?  You ever get knocked?  You ever get rattled a couple times?  If I ever turned around to my mother or father, ever went, hey, fuck you, ask nice, I couldn't 
[02:54:30]  tell you the mess I would have been.  It's got to be a generation thing.  It's got to be.  I can't imagine growing up doing this to my parents.  I would lose an eye.  I would say crap or something as a kid and my father would just, you know, whoosh.  What?  What's that language?  You don't fucking use that.  You don't fucking use that kind of fucking language in this fucking house, you shithead.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, let's go to Rick in Indiana.  Rick.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Happy birthday there, sweet tits. 
[02:55:00]  You guys got to do a comparison.  Thank you.  Between that bitch on the radio and the South Park chick that drives the school bus, that's  the funniest shit I ever heard.  She's her, man.  Oh, Mrs. Crabtree, right?  You got it.  Do a comparison.  It's her, dude.  Yeah, a bunch of people calling in with that.  Very good.  Excellent.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Chris in New Jersey.  Chris, what's going on?  You know, my kid, when I first brought up my kid, we did the timeout thing, and it didn't 
[02:55:30]  work.  Just like you were saying, he just looked at me.  And then it got to the point where finally I took his notebook and smashed it out of his  hands, literally drop-kicked it out of his hands, pushed him up against the wall and  said, that is enough.  He immediately turned into a normal human being and never had a single problem with him since.  Now he's a fabulous, fabulous kid.  Yeah, they're just raising him differently these days.  Yeah, I think it's bullshit. 
[02:56:00]  That's why I hate the left.  Yeah, absolutely.  They treat their kids like their kids are their bettors.  It's ridiculous.  And no Corey on instant feedback.  In fact, my mom never threatened to have Joe Klecko hit me.  No, man.  One good chick, and they get it a lot.  Yeah, idiot.  Everyone knows it was Mookie Wilson.  All right, guys.  Punch it out.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Oh, Klecko.  Jesus.  All right. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, back to the audio here.  Hang in there, Steve.  Get that fucking car down.  No.  I have to go to work.  Well, I don't care now, because you were a bitch.  You come here, threaten me out.  You know what?  Forget it.  Get out.  Go away.  You're not getting it now.  You should have asked nicely.  Oh, you didn't slam it that time.  Well, you had to slam something else.  You're in my fucking house.  You'll follow my fucking rules. 
[02:57:00]  You're grounded.  Tell me.  Don't fucking go to work.  Don't fucking go to jail.  If you are fucking found in these areas, I'm going to fucking run down there and take  your ass out there.  I'm going to work.  You're not.  You're grounded.  Yes, I am.  I'm not even trying to achieve this.  I'm going to go to your goddamn employer and tell him, Galen.  Good for you.  Good for you, you little lamey fucking sassiter.  Wow.  Anthony, I got a question for you.  You're pretty good at this.  Yeah.  How do you think the marriage ended?  Wow. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, that was...  How would you live with a woman like that?  I don't know.  I mean, I understand the kid has driven out of this, obviously.  But she's handling this completely wrong.  The kid is probably reacting much in the same way the father reacted.  Yeah, probably just, hey, whatever.  No, now I'm not going to do it.  Yeah, this kid probably learned from the master.  Learned from his father.  I learned from you, okay?  Whenever mom starts getting like this, just going to, hey, whatever.  Should I ask nice?  And just let her go off like this, like a lunatic. 
[02:58:00]  She should just be bludgeoning him with something.  Just any weapon in that room.  Beating him with his own PlayStation.  I would take his Little League trophy that he got when he was eight years old.  And just beat him with it.  Just beat the shit out of him.  Just beat him.  She should be smashing his Xbox.  Just smash it in front of his face.  You know, the...  There you go.  That gets results.  You know, the Little League trophy that everyone gets because there's no winners or losers.  No winners or losers.  Everyone's a winner. 
[02:58:30]  Everyone's a winner.  That's great.  Oh, is she...  Oh.  You know, I almost feel sorry for her that she is in this position where she has to be...  has to get herself like this.  She knows she can't.  She knows she can't hit him because if there is a divorce situation, there's always the  threat that this little smartass might call diapers or child services.  Or the cops.  So she's frustrated that she can't actually discipline because he might call his father  or something like that.  There's all these...  There's all these other avenues.  Oh, she's just fucked.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:59:00]  She's screwed.  Anyway, look at it.  She's just fucked.  She's in a situation that she's got herself into.  She's a raving lunatic, but she's screwed.  And she's screwed.  Yeah.  You seem to say to you.  You're a fucking little piece of shit.  You know that?  You're all right.  That's exactly what you are.  Go away.  Fucking shit, you're a fucking bitch.  God, you're fucking letting me $50 for that.  Fucking ass nicely.  Fucking ass nicely up your fucking ass, you little spoiled rotten brat.  You're going to like to fucking smack your fucking head in.  You're a goddamn prick. 
[02:59:30]  Don't keep spitting on me.  What the fuck are you doing?  What was she gone?  Are you done yet?  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Oh, I can't.  Oh, I can't.  Oh, I can't.  Oh, I can't.  Oh, I can't.  Oh, I can't.  You're a fucking head.  I can't.  I hope they have their own house.  It's not an apartment.  I can't.  I can't.  Oh, I can't.  I can't.  I can't.  I can't.  Shut up. 
[03:00:00]  What a dick.  Shut up.  I kind of like the kid, though.  Oh, would you shut up already?  And it all started with always and forever.  Oh, yeah.  The wedding song, dreaming of what the future's going to bring.  Oh.  Something nice and sweet and romantic.  We're going to raise a family and have a son, and I'll raise him, and he'll be, I want him  to be just like you, because I love you. 
[03:00:30]  Always and forever.  Oh, fast forward.  They never have that in their heads when they're dancing.  Here's the brand new bride and groom.  Let's wish them all the best of luck raising that family in the future.  Yeah, here they are, smiling, a little whisper, secret in the ear, and everyone at the wedding  is, I wonder what they're saying. 
[03:01:00]  Everyone, you know what they're saying?  I love you.  Everyone with their video camera is getting a good location, so they get a good angle of  the happy couple.  Going, aw.  Here comes the ant running on the dance floor real fast to get that shot.  Let me get a picture.  And then running back off the dance floor.  Oh.  And if you look to the back of the room, the DJ is getting all the blow-up instruments  ready for the next song.  Oh.  There they go slowly.  Oh, what do I see there?  A box of risky business sunglasses? 
[03:01:30]  Oh, hand them out.  I want the whole wedding party to wear them.  And there's the DJ piling up his records.  Yeah.  I see the chicken dance.  Oh, please.  The electric slide's in there.  The electric slide is ready to go.  It's going to be a fun-filled festive night for everybody.  Daddy's little girl.  You've got to play Daddy's little girl.  Meanwhile, Daddy knows what kind of bitch on wheels she is.  He's had to deal with it for years.  He's saying, thank God she's out of my house. 
[03:02:00]  That's 40 years in the hospital.  Being handed the little joy.  The bundle of joy.  And there's little Galen, was his name?  I don't remember what it was.  I don't know.  It was something like that.  Little Galen.  And then just a mirror.  He's got your eyes, honey.  Aw.  He's got your nose.  We have so many dreams for him.  Yeah.  Aw, this is going to be great.  He's going to grow up and send him to college. 
[03:02:30]  Fast.  Be successful.  He's going to do better than I did.  Fast forward a mere 15 years.  Dad is out of the house.  And this is what you get.  Why are you doing this shit?  I'm going to settle this out.  No, you're not fucking me up, Galen.  Give me your fucking car so I can use it.  No.  No.  I'm going to get your fucking ass.  I asked you nicely 10 minutes ago now and get real bad.  And I know I can all fucking care. 
[03:03:00]  This room apart and fucking find it.  You'll be one story again.  I know that's fine.  I've got to get back to work.  Everybody.  Always and forever.  Let's get the entire wedding party out on the floor and join our bride and groom.  Give me a fucking car.  Dance with a lovely couple.  Fuck off, you bastard.  Fuck off.  Get the fuck out of my house.  Get out of my fucking house. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You pay a fucking bill.  Oops.  Looks like it's not always and forever.  It's over, Janet.  You're going to be fucking out of my house and I do hope for work today at 11 o'clock.  Because if you're fucking in here, you're getting out and you're getting there.  Fucking ass.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  No.  You can call your fucking father a woman with him.  How about that, you little son of a bitch?  You just turned this whole fucking 15 minutes on this conversation and I'll fucking see this again. 
[03:04:00]  Stop whining.  Fuck off.  Stop whining.  You nice man that came in here.  Quiet.  You little jerk off.  I'm scared of you.  You're a little head, kid.  Spoiler on rats.  I'm scared.  You're going to fucking learn about life real fucking quick.  I'm scared of you, sir.  And I'm protected by soap.  You're fucking down.  You won't be paid, Mr. Matt.  Get that fucking car now.  No.  I have to go to work.  I don't care now because you're a bitch. 
[03:04:30]  You come here and threaten me out.  You know what?  Forget it.  Get out.  Go away.  Did she ever think her little baby boy would be calling her a fucking bitch?  Right.  As she was holding him in the hospital with little blue blankie.  Right.  You had to slam something else.  Oh, here comes his first words, honey.  You're my fucking house.  You'll follow my fucking rule.  You're crap.  His first words were mama and da, da, da, da.  If you are a fucking found in these areas, I'm going to fucking run down there and put your ass out there. 
[03:05:00]  I'm going to work.  No, you're not.  No, you're not.  I'm going to go to your goddamn employer and tell you them, Galen.  Good for you.  Good for you, you little lazy fucking sabbler.  You're a fucking little piece of shit.  You know that?  Go away.  Go away.  You son of a fucking bitch.  Don't even fucking let me get the dollar credit.  Fucking ask nicely up to your fucking ass, you little spoiled rotten brat. 
[03:05:30]  What happened?  You're a goddamn prick.  I was just rocking you to sleep and see my guest.  What the fuck are you doing?  What happened?  Are you done yet?  Oh.  Oh, no, it echoes.  Sounds like the hallways of an insane asylum. 
[03:06:00]  Shut up.  Shut up.  That's right.  There you go.  Shut up.  When, on Christmas morning when he was a kid and all starry eyed.  Unwrapping his first bicycle.  Unwrapping his gifts.  And now, shut up.  God, I love that.  That is great.  We should almost play the father one now.  Oh, that's fantastic.  You guys have to take this audio and clean it up for TV. 
[03:06:30]  Not a bad idea.  Susan Smith had the right idea.  Get rid of the little fuckers.  It's from Cringe Box.  Very nice.  Oh, wait.  There's actually more to that clip where the neighbor has to come over.  Danny?  Oh, Danny.  Yeah, baby.  Well, it's really long, so I just kind of wanted to give you guys the meat of it.  But she goes on, you know, off mic where you kind of just hear her through the walls for  probably about another two and a half minutes.  Wow.  And then you hear a neighbor come by, and he has to kind of convince the son to just relax. 
[03:07:00]  Just, you know, give your mom the money.  She just has to go to work and get gas.  That's the kind of screaming that does carry two or three houses down.  Can you hear the, did the neighbor go in the room?  Oh, yeah.  You could hear him.  Oh, we got it.  I'll get the rest of it.  Yeah, we can't leave the fine listeners just hanging.  There's a part two to that, Anthony.  Nice.  And we really should try to clean that up for TV.  Not a bad idea at all.  Wonderful.  Let's see.  Dad beat him with wiffle ball. 
[03:07:30]  Irony.  She called him son of a bitch.  I agree.  Yeah, he agreed with it.  Let's see.  Wow.  Listen to this.  Shwuggy.  Hey, Shwuggy, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, Shwuggy.  Morning, fucking tits.  Anthony, you're talking about hitting your father or being scared of him.  I remember when I was 12 and my father was just smacking me around for something I fucked  up.  And I was a man.  I said, screw it.  I smacked him.  Uh-oh.  To this day, I can still remember the fire in his eyes and me just running to my room 
[03:08:00]  and just barricading the door.  But that's when everything changes, though, right?  Not at 12.  No, not at 12.  Oh, not at 12.  Okay.  But what was worse was he left.  He just didn't...  It was one of those things where he held a grudge.  I just remembered until the next time I fucked up.  I know it sucks.  You're 12.  It's not like you can pack your little stuff and throw it on the end of a stick and go run  away somewhere.  Well, you know what's really funny?  Sometimes the balance shifts.  Because I remember I was about 20 or 21, and I was in tip-top physical shape at the 
[03:08:30]  time, working out twice a day.  And I remember just mouthing both of my father or something like that.  He's like, I can still knock you on your ass.  And my father was like 62, 100 pounds overweight.  Oh, knock you on your ass, kid.  Exactly.  Exactly.  But when it gets to that point, it's just damn depressing.  No, you're right.  Well, there's a whole thing that goes on.  When you reach the point where you are old enough and strong enough to take your dad,  you should be on terms with him where you would never think of doing that.  Oh, no.  I remember him saying that to me and me just saying, come on, let's go. 
[03:09:00]  Jokingly.  And my mom was like, yeah, I want to see this too.  You know, of course not.  But it's just sad because we'll all be at that spot at one point.  Well, not you guys, but I will be.  I have two little girls who I do slap on the tushy every once in a while, and they just  don't care.  I mean, it's just amazing.  Every time you hit them, they're closer to the pole.  Closer to putting that, wrapping the leg around the pole and doing circles around it.  I don't say that, man.  All right, punch down.  And they develop that smack move. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, they do the smack and they remember when they were a kid.  When I was a kid, I remember stealing quarters from my father.  Stealing quarters from his bedroom.  Buy something.  I don't even remember what the hell it was.  But he found out and, ooh, that wasn't good.  I got wrapped right across the face.  Open hand.  Big man mitt.  Whap!  Right across my face.  There's a few things that happen.  And you know something?  Again, you just never, I never took the quarters again. 
[03:10:00]  That was it.  But there's a few things that happen.  You know, you do get to an age, if you're in that situation where you do get hit or whatever,  and you finally, you know, stand up to the person, your parents, and then it's never the  same after that.  Right.  That's kind of sad, because then you realize that you sort of have the upper hand.  Yeah, a little bit.  Which is kind of weird when you're like, you're a kid and you've got parents.  And then the other thing is like, it brings back a weird memory for me, you know.  When you're a kid, you're always competing with your father in a way, you know, name it.  Like, in my house, it was basketball, right? 
[03:10:30]  And my dad would play me, because I was into, you know, playing basketball and stuff.  And we'd have like foul shooting contests and stuff.  Yeah.  It was, you know, a dad and son thing to do, you know.  You're going to squirt?  And I'd be struggling, and let's say I'd make, I don't know, six out of ten free throws, let's  say, and then it's dad's turn.  And then, you know, he makes like, you know, five.  He's five for eight, let's say.  And then as a kid, you know, it starts where you don't realize that he's allowing you to  win.  Uh-huh.  You know, so, you know, he misses, obviously, the last two, and he gets five out of ten, 
[03:11:00]  and you win.  Yeah.  And then it gets to a point where then you notice that he's purposely letting you win,  right?  Right.  And that starts to be a bummer.  And then it gets to the stage where there's no letting the son win anymore.  Now the father's trying his balls off to still beat you.  To beat you, yeah.  And then you know that you're now officially, quote, better than him as far as that little  thing goes, that little competition.  And when that happens, it's kind of a drag, too. 
[03:11:30]  You're like, oh, my God, it sucks.  I remember something like that, too, because I was able...  Shooting or something, right?  No, it was, you know, I wasn't able to drink a case of beer.  But then as I got older, I was able to drink more than my father.  You're not even making a joke.  Sometimes I'd spot him a few beers.  You never know with you, though.  There was drinking and effing and horse riding going on.  Jesus.  Yeah.  You weren't being raised at all when you were in California.  Nah, it was like camp. 
[03:12:00]  But it's kind of a weird thing when you're growing up, when it finally hits that level  where now you realize that you've sort of got the upper hand on your parents.  Yeah.  You know, no matter what it is, it's just a little strange.  Toolbag is saying never underestimate old man strength, though.  It's the only thing that comes close to retard strength.  Like your father's strength.  He'll give it his all if he feels you're going to get the upper hand.  Yeah.  I never appreciated that whole, you know, fighting your father thing.  Nah, nah, nah.  It's a little odd.  That is beyond odd. 
[03:12:30]  I'm going to make up to...  Oh, I...  Ever?  Oh, it should have been...  Never.  I never spoke to either one of my parents this way.  I would have woken up to Christmas music.  Push-kill Jim.  Yeah.  From PA.  Yeah, the whole thing, talking back to your parents like that, no way.  Would have been over.  All right, let me see what Jackson has in Florida.  Are you in Jacksonville?  No, I'm Jackson.  My name is Jackson.  I live in Florida.  Ah. 
[03:13:00]  How you doing, guys?  All right, what's up?  Yeah, my ex-wife is in the same situation as this lady was.  She doesn't scream like that.  We still get along real good, but my 14-year-old tried that,  talking back, getting really nasty with her, called her a bitch.  She wouldn't let him spend the night at a friend's house because, you know,  he'd gotten two F's on his report card, all that stuff.  So she called me up.  What do I do?  I said, let him go.  And she's like, you know, what are you talking about?  I said, just let him go.  Trust me on this.  Let him go.  And I said, we're going to fix his little red wagon while he's gone. 
[03:13:30]  And after he was gone for the weekend, I went over there.  We moved all his Xbox, PlayStation, television, everything out of his room.  Literally cleaned it out empty.  Ripped the carpet off the floors down to the concrete.  I bought a cot and put a cot in there with a pillow and took the door off the hinges.  And that's what he came home to.  And the thing that upset him the most was the fact that the door was off the hinges.  So now he has no privacy whatsoever, zero privacy, and no possessions. 
[03:14:00]  We took all of his clothes, went to Walmart, and bought Dickie's pants and white button-down shirts  and said, there, deal with that, you little bastard.  And we made him live like that for a month and have never had a problem with him since.  Wow, you're a sick one, man.  That's nice.  But it worked.  It worked.  You can't beat him.  I mean, if it was up to me, I'd have put my boot in his ass, but you can't do it.  Right.  Now, they will call the cops.  It's happened to friends among us.  Right.  Wow. 
[03:14:30]  You know, I had a good friend of mine, nice guy, great guy, goes to my church, Christian  guy, and he ended up locked up overnight for beating his kid.  Wow.  So that's what I decided to do.  And taking the door off the hinges, it killed him.  He couldn't go in his room.  Yeah, that's their privacy.  Slam the door and gone.  Very good, sir.  They're in their own domain.  A lot of people are asking if this kid in the audio is a stepchild.  No way.  No way, right?  No, it doesn't sound like it.  Let's say hi to James in Oklahoma. 
[03:15:00]  James?  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Morning to you.  And someone else is bringing up a point on the instant feedback and the phones now.  The mother wants to borrow his money in that clip.  Yeah.  I didn't pick up on that.  Yeah, that is odd.  James, go ahead.  Well, I had a stepmother that was just like that, but I never talked to her that way because  I knew what was coming.  So 20 years later, I become a cop here in Oklahoma, and I go to these little kids' houses that  are acting like this. 
[03:15:30]  What do I do?  I tell the parents.  I say, spank them.  They take their belt off, and I'll stand there and watch them spank their child.  That way, they can't come up with this.  Hey, I'm calling Child Protective Services.  I'm calling the cops.  The cops are here.  And I tell the parents, hey, if you're going to spank your child, you spank your child.  Get it over with right now, and maybe you won't have these problems later on in life.  I tell them, hey, if you need some help, I will hold them down.  That doesn't sound so real, right? 
[03:16:00]  You're setting yourself up for a lawsuit, sir, unfortunately.  No, no lawsuit, because I'm not doing anything wrong.  I'm making sure they're obeying the law and disciplining their child, and it's not child  abuse.  Right.  Wow.  Okay.  Thank you, James.  Hey, thanks, guys.  There he goes, James in Oklahoma.  We have the other audio.  Do you have that?  I think everybody's different.  All kids are different.  So if some of them, you can do that whole sit down, take a timeout thing, that's fine. 
[03:16:30]  But I think if the timeout thing isn't working, and you could probably see that pretty early  on, then you've got to resort to plan B.  It would be nice to be the person that, like, oh, I don't have to hit my kids, or I don't  hit my kids, or something like that.  But, you know, and I'm talking up my ass, because I don't have kids, but it just seems  to me like if the timeout thing isn't working, and you're raising a little terror, it might  be time to get a little thing, because it's more about the whole fear of it than it is  the actual pain from getting whacked.  You're not hitting them so they're in pain. 
[03:17:00]  It's just kind of a, you know, wake-er-upper.  It's like a surprise.  Yeah, because...  You're fucking hitting me?  Once I go through that.  Yeah.  Except a little Jimmy Norton, of course.  We've got some audio of the Boston Father.  We've played this...  Oh, yeah.  Well, we've played it once or...  Well, maybe on the replay, you've heard it a couple times.  And Danny's running in with part two of the audio of this chick.  Oh!  Oh, we can save the Boston Father audio, then.  Here's part two of the lady yelling at her son, looking for just money, I guess. 
[03:17:30]  Shouldn't have asked nicely.  Wow.  Sit here, call me all this shit, and you expect me to help you?  Why in the hell should I help you after all you just did?  Why in the hell should I help you after all you just did?  Oh, she was losing her mind. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, she was losing her mind.  Hey, you can't ask me nicely.  You have to sit here and call me names.  Lend your mom 50 bucks.  Why?  Because she's broke, Dale.  Oh, okay.  So now here's the neighbor, like Danny explained.  Danny, the neighbor comes in to try to get this kid to lend the mom 50 bucks.  Fiddy.  Where's this kid getting the money from?  Maybe dad?  Yeah.  All right, here comes the neighbor.  Call me names. 
[03:18:30]  Lend your mom 50 bucks.  Why?  Because she's broke, Dale.  She's being a complete bitch to me.  Because she's broke.  But she's being a bitch.  Look at this.  Like, look at...  Do you want to live here?  Do you want to live here?  No, I'm not going to live in here soon.  But that is complete bullshit.  No...  That's not...  You don't treat somebody like that and expect to get them to help you, like...  The whole point is, Dale, is your mom's got to get to work.  And she's asking you to lend her 50 bucks.  If you can't do it, then, you know, she's been here fucking supporting you guys for over fucking 16 years. 
[03:19:00]  Another scenario.  You move into the neighborhood and you meet the old neighbor.  Hey, neighbor.  Hey.  Howdy, neighbor.  Maybe you invite him over to a barbecue or something.  Yeah.  Now he's in the middle of this crap.  Now he's...  Yeah.  Now he's got to deal with this.  Started with a warm apple pie and now you're talking to her son.  Oh, after hearing her screeching all morning.  Fucking supporting you guys for over fucking 16 years. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  She's been caring about you guys for 16 years.  Like, what the hell is that?  You've got to understand one thing.  That's not how you treat your children.  She's been treating you better than you've ever been treated in your entire lifetime.  No, she hasn't.  You've got to understand this fucking, you know, this isn't easy for her.  This is very fucking difficult.  And this...  Very difficult.  This is acceptable?  You guys aren't helping.  This is not acceptable under any standards ever.  That's not the point, you know.  Just help your mom.  Help my mom so she can act like this, so we can live in a house and she can hurt her. 
[03:20:00]  If you're helping your mom, she wouldn't be acting like this.  She acts like this no matter what.  Okay, that's the way it is.  That's who she is.  Because you guys don't help out around the house.  Even when we do help, and she is nice.  You guys got to wake up, man.  This is the real world.  She needs to wake up a bit too.  It's not teachers and cream out there.  Well, she doesn't get to treat people like that and I expect them to help her.  Help her out.  Please.  She sits here and swears at me.  I hate everything about you.  What the hell is that? 
[03:20:30]  I'm asking you nicely and I'm asking you to fucking please help her out.  I'll pay you back.  I don't give a shit.  Just fucking please help her out.  Okay, I will.  As long as I get my $50.  Yeah, yeah, you'll get it back.  Okay.  Oh, looks like it's going to be okay, Anthony.  Looks like it's going to be okay.  Thanks to the neighbor.  Why is there a minute 40 left in this audio?  There we go.  Yeah.  Mom, do you want the $50?  Shut up, Mom. 
[03:21:00]  Do you want the $50?  Shh.  Why?  Yes, thank God there's not an ounce of money.  You want the $50?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You're a fucking loser.  Shh.  You're going to fucking hell and shut this down, you bastard.  Get the fuck out of the house. 
[03:21:30]  Fucking great.  Fucking war.  You picked the wrong person.  That fucking war man.  Curse you to butter your fucking bread, you little witty ass.  You don't butter my bread?  Are you retarded?  You better fucking me off.  Or what?  Or fucking the police will be coming.  And what are you going to say to them, Mom?  You fucking out of the house.  What are you going to say to them, Mom?  I want you out.  Yeah, Mom.  Good luck.  Good luck with that.  You're going to lie at all?  Good luck with that, Mom.  I'll call them for you. 
[03:22:00]  I will.  Go ahead and call them for me.  You're out.  Kids know too much these days.  Nothing like making your fucking money pay for fucking money.  I wasn't.  I said ask nicely.  Okay.  Get out of here.  This way.  This way.  I can't believe I came home from a fucking ship to fucking do this fucking bullshit. 
[03:22:30]  And cut.  But she wasn't done, neither.  That's for sure.  I think that's when the video camera went off, huh?  Wow, man.  No, there's more?  That's it, right?  That's it.  That's all there is.  Okay.  Wow.  I, uh, hmm.  He just knows too much.  She's going, I'll call the cops.  And he's like, yeah, good luck with that.  She calls the cops.  The kid goes, look, I'm 16.  My mother's insane.  She's yelling at me for things I'm trying to do, you know. 
[03:23:00]  She's kicking me out of the house?  The kid is 16?  The kid's definitely an instigator, but I'm starting to think that she might have more  of a problem than the kid, actually.  Yeah, she's got a huge problem.  The kid probably reminds her too much of the husband, is what it is, who she hates for  probably leaving her.  And every time she looks at the kid, she sees the ex-husband.  You can hear it in his voice.  Yeah.  He's kind of like a beaten kid.  Yeah.  He's just like, yeah.  You know, he's a wise-ass, obviously.  He was, eh.  But you also hear it in his voice, like, this really is a bummer. 
[03:23:30]  She really, this just thinks my mother's insane.  That's an unhealthy relationship they have there.  I think they need help.  Wow.  All right, let's say hi to Stephen California.  That's really going to also help him out in his relationships in the future, I believe.  You know what it's going to be like when he's out there looking for a girlfriend, future  wife, perhaps?  Oof.  Steve?  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, out in California, you know how liberal they are. 
[03:24:00]  I have daughters in an ex-situation, and when I got custody, I asked the child support  worker and my caseworker and custody worker, because I put them in a system to where they  come out to my house and visit so my ex-wife can't say I abused my children, what the definition  of abusing your child was.  And they said as long as you can hate your child open-handed, by law, two or three times,  and as long as you don't go, more than that, it's not considered abuse. 
[03:24:30]  That's a little weird, huh?  That's California.  So you figure if California is a liberal state that way, how are other states seeing  it?  That's all I got.  Punching out.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Timmy in Wisconsin.  Timmy!  Hey, man.  What's up?  My mother would scream exactly like that.  Oh, you're kidding.  She would actually put a butcher knife to her throat and say, I'll do it.  I'll fucking do it.  Are you kidding me?  Her own throat.  She would lock herself in the bathroom, screaming from the bathroom, I'll do it, and she'd be 
[03:25:00]  slashing furniture with it.  Wow, that's really crazy.  I kept the knife for like over a year with like dents all in it, and then it happened  again like a year later.  What?  And I brought it out, and my dad grabbed it from me.  He's like, this shouldn't be around here.  She's afraid like the wrong person would see it, and mommy would be put away in a straitjacket.  What does she do now?  Sits at home, watches TV.  Yeah?  Do you have a relationship with her?  Yeah. 
[03:25:30]  Well, it was mostly because like my dad was drinking, and when my dad quit drinking, then  she got really bad.  Yeah.  But then after like a year, it calmed down, and she's pretty cool now.  You goof on her about it?  Well, no, not now.  I mean...  Because we goof on my mother all the time about how she used to be crazy.  Someone just left dinner, though.  Yeah.  She was insane with cleaning the house.  We would wake up Saturday mornings, and my mother would be like, it didn't matter.  You know, I guess we're 12, something like that. 
[03:26:00]  Who even knows?  But she'd wake us up.  Come on, get up.  This place looks like a fucking bomb hit it.  Get...  And you know, meanwhile, I'm just thinking, you know, a few years later, you start thinking,  oh, I get it.  Clean the house.  Make sure it's clean.  You know, there's some issues there, Mommy.  Well, you're not alone with that one, though.  Yeah.  I think a lot of people could relate to that one.  But we were all like, you know, you know, this one's dusting, this one's vacuuming the  house, and she was just, you know, get under it.  What is this?  Pick that up.  Just crazy.  And then the phone would ring, and she'd pick it up and be like, and don't go with that. 
[03:26:30]  Make sure you get under the couch.  How the hell are you?  Hot, yeah.  Oh, nothing.  We're just sitting around.  So we would clean up so quickly while she was on the phone.  So then we could walk up to her as she's on the phone and go, Ma, I'm going to go outside.  I'm going to go outside.  And she would kind of do that, not even look at you, but wave the hand like, okay, all  right.  Right, right.  And then you were out of the house.  When that phone rang, we would, because we'd be going nuts.  We'd be, you'd be with all your cleaning tools, and the phone would ring. 
[03:27:00]  And I cannot tell you the relief that would come over three kids just from a phone ringing.  Because you knew you weren't being yelled at as you're cleaning up.  She was crazy.  But now, you know, we're sitting around, and she's a pisser now.  And we just sit around and goof on her about it, about how crazy she was, and what the hell  was your problem?  She was raising you animals by herself.  Pat in Boston, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  That lady needs Scientology and not Paxil.  Scientology.  Good call back, bro.  Very good, Pat.  That's a great call. 
[03:27:30]  Tony in the Bronx.  What's up, Tony?  Yo, guys.  You got to see what it was like growing up with a wise guy as a father.  Oh, really?  I'm talking about when I was a kid, I used to go make the Sherlock collections with him.  And I used to watch my father give guys beatings.  And for as long as he was alive, he'd never lay the finger on me.  I never gave an opportunity to.  But my mother, she was the executioner.  But having the wise guy in the family, that was a trip.  Really?  That's always in the back of your head, I got to imagine.  I'm going to miss you.  Being on the phone with you guys right now. 
[03:28:00]  So, he's gone.  But if his friends recognized my voice, I'd get to talk to him for this.  Really?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Where do you live in the Bronx?  I mean, I'm telling you.  What's your last name, Tony?  He was pretty notorious.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Okay, Doc.  Take care.  Oh, can we play Guess the Wise Guy?  All right.  Tough guy.  All right.  We should move on, huh?  Sure.  That was very entertaining.  One more. 
[03:28:30]  Eric in Colorado.  Eric.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  The guy that called earlier was saying about stripping his kid's room, I can top that.  My best friend and former neighbor, he had a 14-year-old that did the same shit.  He wanted to go camping with some friends.  And they let him go after, like, three or four days of arguing.  When the kid came home, the house was completely empty.  His parents had a rental property.  They moved everything out of the house except for his belongings that they left in his room.  They moved into the rental house, and they left a note that said, now, you take care of everything. 
[03:29:00]  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  He just, and they were my next-door neighbors at the time.  And, you know, so the kid comes home, the friends drop him off.  He walks up, unlocks the door, walks in.  There is nothing.  You've got to think that starts off as being the greatest day of your life.  But by 11 o'clock at night, you've got to be freaked beyond belief.  Well, yeah, because he kept trying to call his parents on their cell phone,  and they wouldn't answer or anything. 
[03:29:30]  He'd come over and ask me, he said, do you know where my parents are?  And I said, dude, I said, Saturday, they were like here with a moving truck leaving,  because I knew what had happened.  So you know what?  He called child services, and actually the caseworker that came out,  and, I mean, that poor woman laughed for like 20 minutes when she found out what had happened.  Yeah, you've got to imagine they have some great stories, those people.  So what happened?  What happened in the end with this?  They ended up, I mean, they moved everything back,  because all they did was just put everything in the garage or the rental.  They didn't unpack everything.  But, like, they came back the next day, and, I mean, 
[03:30:00]  that kid has just been on his best behavior ever since, because his parents sold him.  They said, you know what?  They said, what would you have done if we wouldn't have even let you any forwarding information at all?  And you'd have come home, and there'd been nothing.  Wow.  You know, you'd have been seriously screwed.  I'm sure that kid behaved after that, huh?  Oh, yeah.  This has been a couple of years.  I guess you've just got to be creative out there if you're parents, huh?  Yeah.  You know, the hitting is out of the game, so you've got to get a little more creative.  More than just time outs. 
[03:30:30]  This is why I don't have kids.  It really is, man.  When I hear shit like this, people say, why don't you and your wife have kids?  I say, you know, look at society, man.  Look at these kids today.  To all the new parents out there, just remember this later today when you're by yourself, away from the radio show.  Always and forever.  Always starts like that.  Rob from Washington.  Oh, my God, my mom was a super cleaner, too.  Never thought of it until you mention it. 
[03:31:00]  Maybe there's something else there.  Oh, that is the one I need.  I need Ted.  My mother would scream like a harpy like that and insult my brother, sister, and myself.  She would always use the maybe I'll just die and you'll be happy routine.  The insults and shrieking just brought back wonderful memories.  And then Chris from Bridgeport.  The best quote from my mother was when she was ripping pissed one day.  She said, I'm going to kick you so hard in the balls, they're going to end up in the roof of your mouth.  Wow.  Moms can be pretty creative with their language. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, yeah.  My mom was always with the racial slurs.  A lot of racial slurs growing up.  She called you the N-word?  No, she used it a lot, though.  She would use it as far as cleaning would go.  The house looks like a bunch of, hmm, live here.  What do I look three shades darker than you is always a good one.  Clean up.  Oh, can you get it?  What do I look three shades darker than you?  Clean up.  Wow.  She was the worst.  Well, that explains a lot of things. 
[03:32:00]  She's changed.  That explains a lot of things.  She got older and wiser.  About her son.  About her son.  Bob in Minnesota.  Yeah, we used to have to tackle my ex-girlfriend's mother because she'd walk around the house  punching the windows out in the house.  We'd have to tackle the floor and stop her.  You tackled your ex-girl's mom.  Yes.  Wow.  Yeah.  Her arms would be all cut up and shit from punching through the windows.  Hey, I also got a Ben Tog joke.  Ben Tog is so big that terrorists like to slide planes into it. 
[03:32:30]  Punch it out.  All right.  Let's say hi to John in Philly.  Yeah.  What's up?  I got to say, maybe your mom, you know, being the whole clean freak she is, is what made  you freak out and, you know, get rid of your couch when it had a booger on it and everything  else under the sun.  Nah, because I'm a lazy bastard.  I won't care if things are cluttered.  Like, it wasn't dirty stuff.  It was just clutter stuff.  Like, if we had our magazines laying around or, you know, there was like a little bit of  dust on the old stereo cabinet or something, that was a problem. 
[03:33:00]  Me?  I could give a shit.  Things like that.  It doesn't bother me.  Okay.  But my mother was insane when it came to that stuff.  With the Windex and the Lemon Pledge and the vacuum going.  Yeah.  My mom was ridiculous when it came to that stuff.  To the point, we all just went the other way and we're all slobs.  Yeah.  See?  That's what happens.  Good job.  I mean, yeah.  It freaks me out if things are too organized.  Sweeping the brooms and the shovel and the dustpan and the frigging vacuum. 
[03:33:30]  You're watching TV and that vacuum comes calling.  No.  It was always us vacuuming.  Oh, yeah.  Well, it started with mom and her old blue bathrobe just banging into your legs.  In the 70s, we had some great vacuums, too.  Boy, those things were nice, convenient.  They weighed 12 tons.  It had different parts.  They were supposed to be convenient on wheels.  I mean, we had this canister vacuum that when you pulled it, it just tipped over.  It was a big hose with the thing at the end and it was attached to a canister that was 
[03:34:00]  supposed to, when you first got it on like Christmas or something, when dad would get mom  the vacuum for Mother's Day, it was on wheels and it rolled for like a month.  And then once one of the wheels froze up because the carpet fibers would get in there, you'd  go to pull it and tip over and go, whoo, and then it would make like a whining sound  because it was clogged and dusted, start shooting out of it.  And the dirt would shoot out.  Pick that up!  That's why I hate vacuums to this day.  It's not even a bit.  Because my mom vacuumed every day, easily every day. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  More than once a day, too.  It was constant in our house.  All right, we should break, Ant.  When we get back, we'll wrap up the show with a little what did we learn on the Opie and  Anthony program.  Maybe get into something else before we get out of here.  How's that sound?  And we saved stuff for tomorrow.  Yes, we did.  I see where you're going.  Bombs and flubs, volume two.  Right.  On the show tomorrow.  Um, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's top stolen cars. 
[03:35:00]  They did a thing on this on the news.  The Acura Integra is made for speed and that's being stolen the most, I guess.  Yeah, it's the cars all the homies like driving.  And the Hispanic people like driving those.  Vehicles stolen were either made for speed or had bling value.  Yeah, bling value.  Wait, we have these clips?  You never see like the Volvo being stolen.  Or the Saturn.  No one wants a Volvo.  Or a little Jimmy Norton Saturn.  Like, yo, I like that safety rating.  That's good. 
[03:35:30]  That's why.  You can get in an accident with this.  My car is so beat up and it's only, uh...  Pretty old now.  I guess it's going on four years, yeah.  Four?  Four years.  But it is so beat up and people are like, why don't you buy a new car?  I'm like, why?  The car runs great and I'm safe this way.  No one's looking at my car to steal.  No one's looking to gank you.  Not at all.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus. 
[03:36:00]  We got some great audio that came in.  Oh, yeah.  Steve just handed in of the mayor of Boston, Menino.  Our old pal, Mayor Menino.  He has what amounts to a calf's liver for a tongue.  It's just this giant piece of flesh that knocks around in his mouth and obscures everything he tries to say.  Couple that with him being retarded.  The guy is, he's not very, he's not very bright. 
[03:36:30]  And his speeches are a joke.  Everything he says.  Everything that comes out of that fat, blubbery mouth of his is, it sounds retarded.  He's reading to the school kids here.  Dear Father Ron, the Ron is very cold at night.  The Ron, the Ron, he's reading to children, right?  Is that what he's doing there?  Like they're going to the schools.  The Ron, the Ron, the Ron. 
[03:37:00]  Oh, my goodness.  I feel secure with my speaking ability today.  Dear Father Ron, the Ron, the Ron is very cold at night.  The Ron.  He flubbed the Ron.  The Ron.  And he's reading it.  I also say, anyone who does this work, it's not for money. 
[03:37:30]  I don't do it for money.  Let me tell you that, my friend.  You know, I see my friends and what they're doing in life.  I say, my God.  I grew up in the streets of Hyde Park.  My father worked in a factory, so I wasn't born with a golden spoon.  Isn't it born with a silver spoon in your mouth?  Yeah.  I wasn't born with a golden spoon. 
[03:38:00]  It was born with a ladle in his mouth, and he still has it in there.  What a muttering, stuttering ass.  That isn't born with a golden spoon.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading. 
[03:38:30]  All right, let's go right to the phones.  Dave the Trucker.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hello, Dave.  Anthony, you left us hanging on the credit card.  What the hell is going to happen to me?  Oh, we did leave everyone hanging on the credit cards.  Yeah, is it a big deal, Anthony?  It's a pretty big deal.  Within the next month, Bank of America, MBNA, and Citigroup,  which are in charge of a lot of credit cards out there,  is going to raise their minimum monthly payments on their cards from 2% of the balance to 4%. 
[03:39:00]  So that's doubled.  That means if you have a credit card and your minimum monthly payment,  you're squeaking by by making it, and it's, what, $60 maybe, something like that,  it's now going to be $120.  Take your credit minimum payment and double it.  That's what it's going to be.  This is the government's idea of making the banks raise the rates like this  to get Americans out of debt more quickly.  Oh, gee, thank you.  I want to thank the government personally. 
[03:39:30]  Why do you think people are paying the minimum?  Because that's all they could afford.  This is going to be a lot of people now.  I'm having to call their credit card companies and renegotiate some kind of deals.  A lot of people are going to go to collection.  That's a huge increase, 50%.  I remember my credit cards don't.  The credit card companies don't want you paying off the balance ever.  No.  They would love to keep you just paying it like it was.  When I was, I had credit card debt, huge amounts.  I was about 20 large deep in credit card debts, 
[03:40:00]  and it was the minimum payment every month.  Nothing was going toward the principal.  I was paying for years, and I made no headway.  But the only way I could survive was by making the minimum payment.  And how did you finally get out of debt?  Ah, radio.  That's right.  I was hoping for you.  I met you, Opie.  Oh, Opie got me out of debt.  It's true, though.  I never would have gotten out of debt, ever. 
[03:40:30]  I remember that day when you finally paid off your debt.  You were a happy, happy, happy man.  Bit of my last credit card bill.  Yeah.  So what is that freak going to do today?  What are you doing today?  Come on in.  Make sure he doesn't hurt us.  Yanbag from Boston, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, I learned that Sirius used to make vacuum cleaners back in the 70s.  Punch it out.  All right.  12-ton vacuum.  Let's say hi to Prozac from whackbag.com.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned birthdays are just another day closer to the dirt nap,  and the ONA show can take nothing and make shit out of it. 
[03:41:00]  All right.  Very good.  That one's coming in a lot.  Brian, what did you learn on the show today?  Yeah, I learned that the crazy lady audio really saved the show.  I love the crazy lady audio.  Yeah, we pulled that one out of our ass, huh?  What's your name, buddy?  Dean from Tom's River.  Dean.  It's Dean.  What are you doing today?  From Tom's River.  I'm going to promote you in Times Square.  I am.  You are?  I printed out a bunch of flyers.  All right.  You've got to have at least 50, then.  My art.  My art.  I mean, I paid for myself.  Look at you.  I drove here.  Wait a minute.  You took it upon yourself. 
[03:41:30]  I want you guys to send people down to Times Square.  You took it upon yourself to...  Last Wednesday, Anthony's complaining that you can't use your own fucking van.  That's right.  And nobody's fucking promoting you.  I call up Washington, D.C.  They don't have your fucking phone number here.  I'm a new character on your show.  Oh, you are?  The only fucking guy that doesn't have your phone number, guy.  I was going to call up, and I was just going to...  I said I'm going to fucking call up and...  Wait, so you spent $90 of your own money to print up flyers, and you're going to go down  to Times Square and hand these out? 
[03:42:00]  Another 23 to park or 46 to park.  Wow.  That's pretty cool.  So you've got listeners spending money, because if you guys go off the air, I have a 2005 Honda.  I'll just throw it off a bridge.  Look at that.  Now the listeners are going to spend their own money to promote the Opie and Anthony show.  Fucking Washington.  Just making Washington look silly.  Washington doesn't have your fucking number.  I called up Washington.  They don't have your number, and they don't have your name. 
[03:42:30]  They got G. Gordon Liddy on there.  They go, we have sports.  We have this.  We have that.  They don't have the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  I had to turn on a radio recently, and I heard that exact recording.  And I said, that's fucking absurd.  They talk about having, I think, Dr. Laura and G. Gordon Liddy, and no real mention of us.  It says 3.7 million listeners.  Oh, we're way past that, sir.  So, all right.  We've got to fix that.  We've got to get the McDonald's sign, because that's changing so fast.  We're well over four.  I think we're close to four and a half at this point.  I got... 
[03:43:00]  I'm sorry.  And let me just...  I just want to show you what else I did.  That was creative.  So that went...  You know, I made a little Jimmy.  You see the little Jimmy on the back?  Yeah.  Happy birthday to the little Jimmy Norton.  Very good.  So, because, you know, your listeners will like that.  But then you got the...  Where the hell?  I did front and back.  Hey, Poe.  How you doing today, man?  So that went...  Yeah?  Good?  Yeah.  When somebody throws it on the ground...  Yeah.  ...they look at both sides.  That's right.  Ah!  Clever.  You know, this guy's on to something, though.  Unfortunately, he had to spend his own money. 
[03:43:30]  We'll reimburse you somehow, sir.  $90 to hand out flyers today.  I think we should have Opie and Anthony Earth Day very soon.  No, but you need a road show.  Let me explain Opie and Anthony Earth Day.  We're going to pick a day in the very near future.  And if Washington says we can't do it...  Uh-oh.  ...they'll be hell to pay.  Yeah.  We'll ask for volunteers.  The first annual Opie and Anthony Earth Day.  We'll start small in New York.  And maybe then we'll branch out after that.  And basically, we'll invite all the faithful listeners to come down. 
[03:44:00]  Maybe we can get some food.  Things like that.  And we give them all a bunch of WoW stickers, flyers, what have you.  Remember in school, Earth Day, everyone got together and cleaned up their little...  ...the litter in their schoolyard?  Of course.  We go the other way.  Everyone comes to the station one day.  And litters.  The official Opie and Anthony Earth Day.  And we send everyone out all over Manhattan to hand out WoW stickers and flyers.  Huh?  What?  I need your number before I leave today.  Ah.  So I can call in.  So I can be...  ...doesn't have the fucking number, guys. 
[03:44:30]  Okay, it's...  Opie and Anthony Earth Day.  Program complete. </pre>
