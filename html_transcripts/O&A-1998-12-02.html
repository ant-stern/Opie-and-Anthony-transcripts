[06:30]
 jimmy joseph joseph congratulations  but see every other radio stations announced the winners of contest so that  one person screened on the  the rest of the rest of the listening world to go  hair  well i think it was java  speaking of winning  you probably heard about the aris with him and i have  truly cool starting friday we have a ton of tickets  to give way to see our smith when they come to town december twenty seventh  and  the grand prize winners you know when a private guitar lesson from aris with joe 
[07:00]
 prairie and get an autographed gipsy guitar that's pretty cool that is really  cool  the winning starts friday morning at  nine a m  we were going to play the firby police here but uh...  uh...  if you guys only knew what went on behind the scenes loops  that bit has been pulled from our possession  yeah has been run upstairs to the lawyers  uh...  and since we have some people listening to the show not for uh... enjoyment 
[07:30]
 purposes now they're just listening to try to get some trouble  now one of those christian groups  i know that i know are you guys i know  no no hoping i'll stop it they do a very good service  for all the people out there that can't make up their own minds and and don't  uh...  don't know whether they should be listening to the show or not  they don't know where the dial is on the radio maybe  they need people like that  to tell them what to listen to when the world be a much better place if you 
[08:00]
 didn't have to make  any of those decisions  by listening to radio like what station or listen to our  what show do i watch on t v what books or read  i would love it if somebody would just  comment  and decide that for me other people trying to do that every day and how my  that's off to him  because it would be such an easier life if i didn't have to decide anything you  know i just can't think for myself now i think about it yeah i'm actually i'm  making decisions you people are much too stupid  you know out there and and we need these people 
[08:30]
 like this uh... christian group  to pull things off of our show and tell you people  that you can't or should be listening to this because it's it's harmful to you  you don't know this  because you're too stupid  now we're too stupid obviously i know what we should be saying  but the bank dot somebody like that is out there still decide for everyone  just like it would be a thank you  today the same people that got rid of the condom christmas tree in the in the  park yeah  because they thought it was outrageous or something or so uptight 
[09:00]
 when on believable when all all the group was trying to do is uh... you know  create awareness about aids who cares about rubbers on christmas trees and  boobs on t v or talking about boobs on the radio  occurs on the but i mean what  who cares  how is it going to hurt you  i don't know i would really like to know the answer to that most of the most kids  grow up  uh... if they're trying to uh... people trying to shield them from things that  will hurt them like nudity 
[09:30]
 and and cursing  and they go with their friends and look through playboys and they see nudity  and they might go home in here  their parents yell obscenities at each other or whatever and you just grow up  it's no big deal  but these groups feel these holy rollers  make me sick  they really do  so now what are we going to we do that can we well it was a great phone call  yesterday where the furby police were calling on the people in the classifieds  are trying to sell furbies for like three four five hundred dollars and we're 
[10:00]
 just messing with them horribly  and uh... anthony uh... called the guy  doesn't as a godfather as the godfather pretty much as a mobster mobster and the  guy on the phone sound like he was a mobster as well in the language got  very outrageous and got a little you know raw it was uh... very fun listen to  have we've had a hundred quest for it and now i don't know if we'll ever be  able to play that again  it thank you to whoever there's rick running the pit upstairs of the lawyers 
[10:30]
 to listen to us  this great  is a great that you just can't even  say anything anymore  you can't talk you can't watch things  every second  another personal freedom is getting ready to be snatched out from under  people  and and no one seems to care our personal freedoms on the show are being  taken away this the second bit and get eggs all the time personal freedom  snatched away  and no everyone just walks along the merry way and goes oh well it's just one 
[11:00]
 and then before you know it is dead  the hundred  uh... and then you can't do anything anymore  so  all right well now what we can do  we had this whole break plan but they ran down and said we can play that's all  right let's talk about mariah's ass  rise as well we're going to talk about my carries a long looking in the paper  and she's got a rash  as you get a rash pop goddess mariah carrie says she's suffering from a  stress-related skin disease that turns simple scratches on her skin into angry  red welts mariah's got rashes that's kind of interesting and play with and 
[11:30]
 she's saying it's from stress  now i think it's from  puppies afro  it depends on where the rest of the  well i think that they have a team and wonder about that one  because uh... they got to think about it  now she's blaming her rash on tommy matala of the guy that made her  yeah i said she's got a she's gone around for the past uh...  well since the divorce 
[12:00]
 and just bad mouth this guy  mostly badmouthing carefully just enough  because she doesn't want  him to record career consider he's the head of her label still and whether the  guy's a jerk or not  she climbed into bed with them  that's it as you just saying she claims she was held captive and all this stuff  on this  you know this mansion  i said i was held captive in a mansion so  an old gnarly woman pushing a shopping cart down the street saying 
[12:30]

[14:30]
 pulls it away she starts wet again  and her clothes  you can see there's a picture of our own page fourteen in the post and it starts  getting see through  because it gets soaking wet  uh... you can see whitney nip  but now it's not much to look at i never thought of her as a citizen being very  attractive  well as you see the sweaty pig  well great that was some good radio to thank you all because i thought you had  something to that i may like that  i had your on all right i had all right i'll add something to have 
[15:00]
 uh... don't make it as some kind of red little liner business statement  okay i'll mention said reliance tonight at the right  white lies it gonna take two hours to uh...  to turn the damn tree on  i have no idea why would it take two hours to turn the train seriously why  can we just turn the damn thing on and move on  they have to make this big celebration and  and have all these bands perform  and that it 
[15:30]
 that your contribution great we can play the day  we can play the best thumbs up we got thumbs up we waste the time right good  now we were in trouble there  i will stick around we can play the bit that we're supposed to do here instead  of the real bad radio you just heard  uh... i guess the lawyers approved it  iraq and new york  what is the seven w any w is open and then  how we get into this very police thing  yeah we're doing a service here for uh... you guys 
[16:00]
 you know we don't want you guys to  to uh... believe the hype about the furby dolls  everybody's gone crazy i gotta get a freebie now for my child was watching  a little of uh... regis and kathy lee this morning  and they got a furby doll that they've been fooling around with all weekend  having fun with them  and  i think regis is so cool i want to read some of the show so bad because he's like  us he's like the stupid furby dolls and he was abused in the dollar stuff  kathy lee's like  i got an idea  let's raffle it off right now with the studio audience and raise money for 
[16:30]
 cassidy's house off  and raises like that give me that dial back we're gonna do that  stupid dumb idea  but but but you're gonna hear other radio stations in the next week or two  they're gonna get a furby doll  and they are gonna uh... auction off and they're gonna raise about a thousand  dollars and they're gonna give it to some stupid charity yeah  you know because it's just that  some radio promotion the big thing to do  with the furby dolls the furbys yes but uh... we're taking the other tact and  we're uh... going to the classifies were fine the people 
[17:00]
 that are uh... trying to make four five six hundred dollars off the furby dolls  let's go to go through your local paper  you'll see all the people in there trying to sell these damn things more and more  every day yes right up to christmas matter of fact i think we should start  collecting for re-dial zin maybe give away concert tickets or something and  then destroying the furby dolls  do it and uh... you know in the park a lot of toys are us or something  so the housewives just freaking out 
[17:30]
 i couldn't find a fair day  now that is trying them  the elastist right for the dogs brought off the roof here  so i'll we encourage you to send your furby dolls into the open at the show  you know they will put them all on a pile and will will burn them  but the battle at what the cab uh... cab drivers run them over on fifty  seven  why not  i'm for it yeah so we had a furby police uh...  phone call yesterday anthony was a mob boss he took that tax 
[18:00]
 got ahold of the guy after he talked to his mother  and got pretty uh... pretty harry to say the least yes  and we want to play is about twenty minutes ago but  we found out some christian group  yes some christian groups are a little upset some christian group is deciding  that uh... you guys you listeners out there in your car is stuck in traffic  looking for a laugh  you guys should not hear this type of stuff should be listening to this it's  uh... detrimental to you know but you don't know  but they know what's best for all of us so we should all agree with them so they 
[18:30]
 registered a complaint with the fcc  they don't they didn't think that the bleeps in this uh... phone call you're  about to hear  you know what bleeps uh... well enough that you can actually hear the curses  it was a big deal around the radio station twenty minutes ago gary our boss  runs in  grabs at the run upstairs with the day  and then uh... you know that they were in a uh... closed uh... office for about  twenty minutes to decide if we could play it or not and i believe they've  decided to play it 
[19:00]
 one part of the big boss upstairs and make sure  yellows  and office  was mister herman available  uh... he's going to make a commitment  uh... so being anthony downstairs i cannot for a fact that you are right  and i don't know  mister herman we got to live on the air  either alone  uh... i would never take a call for those of the year  and i said what could be so important that that might be my stars in the 
[19:30]
 afternoon of calling me here at my office  well we want to know uh...  what happened with that bit there  you guys get a chance to uh... preview it  uh... yes we did okay  and uh... we think we think it's acceptable to our standards  so who are other acceptable to your status but uh...  but we thought it was acceptable to place who was writing  uh... we got a couple of course was listed right  and uh... i just wanted to make sure that the people was in the right places  the act is we have a tendency to uh... to forget where the curse actually was  we'd be some of these things that the public about our government sometimes

 because that's one of my favorite Skinner songs  Yee-Haw  Yee-Haw is right  it's Opie and Anthony Stockbroker Dave's on the line  Stockbroker Dave  hey boys  i hear you have some research on the Furby doll  yes i do  i heard your bit about it  and it's owned by Hasbro  Hasbro  which six weeks ago was trading at $28  alright what's it up to?  $38  ahhhh  $38  why do we see that coming?  i don't know you listed to these schmucks on CNBC 
[26:00]
 and we couldn't have figured this out  that's like common sense  common sense investing  and you didn't even figure it out?  no i never even heard of a Furby doll until you guys mentioned it  i guess it's a good investment all around huh?  people are buying these things for $29.95 and selling them for $300  that's pretty damn good profit  that's what i call profit sharing  but if we saw this coming six weeks ago we could have made 35%  alright here's the other thing 
[26:30]
 what other things are going on around us right now for the holiday season  that we could jump on the bandwagon and make a quick few bucks?  i bet you the callers could tell you  i don't know  i mean i would know that  i've got levels into the malls  you know what are the kids wearing?  what kind of sneakers are they wearing?  what kind of clothes are they wearing?  that's the best investment in the world  my wife is a great investment in Allison  she comes in and says the kids are wearing what kind of sneakers?  and whenever sneakers are hot  you know that company is going to make a fortune  because all the kids jump on the bandwagon  have you made money off the sneaker companies? 
[27:00]
 no she came home one day and told me to buy LA gear  she said they have these sneakers that light up  all the kids want them  we bought it at $6  sold it at $26  cool  we made $20 in like three or four months  wow  she told me to buy little tykes  all the kids had this little tyke stuff  doubled up money in that  she's got great investment advice  anybody who spends time in the malls  looking around and paying attention can make a fortune  yeah  huh  alright Dave  alright boys 
[27:30]
 thanks bro  have a good night  take care of yourself  that's interesting  look at that huh  screw stockbroker Dave  we've got to get his wife on the line  yeah  to help us out with some stock tips  and stockbroker Jill, Dave's wife  she seems like she's making the money in that family  yeah  well everyone's calling about the Tuesday night Hummer Club  yes  I haven't announced whether I became a member  yeah you got to fess up  well I guess we could get into that whole controversy next  how's that?  alright 
[28:00]
 because you came up with that stupid law at the end of the show yesterday  and in case people didn't hear Anthony late in the show yesterday  you better stick around because it got a little ugly to say the least  alright  got Tamara Smith on the way and Bad Co. next  I said it  what?  I always promised myself I would never say Bad Co.  Bad Co.  that's what you hear all the other rock chucks say  hey come on up some Bad Co. everyone  hey they related but they do be brothers  stick around  1027 W&W the Rock of New York 
[28:30]
 Wallflowers  Sophie and Anthony for the ride home  thanks for checking us out today we definitely appreciate it  we're the most talked about radio station in New York it seems huh  yeah  thank you thank you very much they only talk about the people they love and they're scared  of thank you thank you very much  get love  I don't think it's love that they're talking about us  who knows who cares just keep mentioning us  yeah that's all  it'll only help us trust me  mm-hmm 
[29:00]
 trust me on that one  so where do we begin here Anthony?  a lot of people are checking in  well you have to fess up now or or  that's it I'm throwing you out of the Hummer Club permanently  okay  OPI as everyone knows has not been a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club  the club I created  he created it  made himself Grand Puba  yes  we got to go through this again  that's okay  I wrestled away his Grand Puba status 
[29:30]
 yes  and the big Grand Puba hat which I now proudly wear  because he was not a member  and the hat looks ridiculous on you  it doesn't look ridiculous  it's four feet high and it's a silly  it hurts my neck  it's a big purple helmet  but I wear it proudly because I am the Grand Puba  you are not  all right and as Grand Puba you're allowed to lay the law of the land right Anthony?  yes  okay and late in the show yesterday  what was the new law you came up with for the Tuesday Night Hummers?  that the membership 
[30:00]
 when you get a Hummer on Tuesday night you are a member  this should not be a member for life  you should have to re-up  and I made it every three months  to re-up  and you think the lifters are going to go for that?  your propaganda has turned this around  because I meant you can still get it every week  I just meant you are not a member after three months  yes say that to the ladies  they'll wait till the last second  that means guys whoever became a member last night to the Tuesday Night Hummer Club 
[30:30]
 technically the ladies don't have to do the Hummer thing until March 1st  this isn't my intention  March 1st  your polls are drastically changing  I've noticed a slight change  a slight change  in some of the people's way they perceive me  but I am still Grand Puba  I am the leader of this organization  and that is the law  your favorable polls are down to 28%  before you made your statement it was 98.9% 
[31:00]
 well because who wanted a guy in there that isn't even a member?  that's all  that's all I'm saying  the only reason you are the Grand Puba of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club is why?  because you, Opie, are not a member  alright  you have not fessed up to being a member or anything else  and I am still Grand Puba  regardless of if anybody doesn't like the three month membership rule  now what did you say?  there's only one way I can get my Grand Puba status back, right?  that's always been from the start  okay  I would change it now  I would like to but obviously I can't  no you can't  from the start we said yes 
[31:30]
 if you do become a member  you will get your Grand Puba status back  have you?  uh oh what's he doing?  Sandy!  Hi  hi sweetie  hi hi  wait a minute  this isn't looking good for the kid  if he's got you on the phone  oh no wait a minute  no it's okay  now Sandy was home on a Tuesday for the first time  for the first time  no  first time in a year  yeah  and no  and sweetie do you have any news today to report? 
[32:00]
 well I do have news but  what do you mean by but?  what?  this is good what?  what I think is if anyone should have the Grand Puba hat it should be me  I think the person who performs the act is the one who should have the hat  always looking for something  now I just want to know one thing  yeah?  is OP officially a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club? 
[32:30]
 yes  ah damn no way come on  no no no  sweetie I'll buy you anything what do you want?  just bring home the hat  bring home the hat?  no I want the hat I am still Puba  well then talk to Jen because I'm kind of juiced up for tonight  well I indeed did retain my membership last night  oh you did?  I just want to say that yes I did 
[33:00]
 oh man she's always got one up on me  wait but according to the bylaws I officially become Grand Puba of my own club once again  Rick take the hat off his head  no no  take the hat off his head  don't wait  take the hat off his head  no get away from me  it's my hat  hold him down hold him down  hold him down  yeah  now give me the hat  give me it back  Rick proudly put the Grand Puba hat on my head  shut up  shut up 
[33:30]
 shut up is so degrading I feel violated  how do I look?  you look ridiculous  how do I look Rick?  you look alright  I look better than he does with his stupid hat  no  well  I think he does look better at this point especially because he's got the big smile  he's got the release tension  Anthony sitting there even though he was re-upped he doesn't look that happy  well there's nothing there's nothing for you to say  I am now the Grand Puba of the club once again Opie the creator of the club and I am 
[34:00]
 changing some laws right now  what?  first of all I am suspending you  get out  yeah yeah  you can't do that  I sure can  you can't do that  you were on a two week suspension you can't do that  you have no privileges  none  holy  and if I could take your hummers away from you I would do that too  but unfortunately I can't but maybe I could cast a spell on you so you don't enjoy them  anymore  you are done sir 
[34:30]
 you son of a bitch  you hand back your pledge pin  give me your pledge pin  I mean  give me your pledge pin it's all over  I  thank you hand it over thank you very much thank you  you are suspended for two weeks  this is a travesty  a travesty  is my time here John?  you can't do this to me  I was just a poobah  you are nothing now  I think we have a new flounder  you are a flounder 
[35:00]
 thanks sweetie  you're welcome  alright I'll buy you whatever you want  like five minutes ago I was just a poobah  just five minutes ago  what happened?  you will not engage in any of the privileges of being a club member  nothing  nothing  nothing  you're done  but I was just a poobah  two weeks and this three month rule is out the door right away  bastards I'll get you I'll get you all 
[35:30]
 if you want to call and talk to the you know the  the new poobah or the loser  give us a call 212-757-1027  I was a poobah  you are nothing now  you are suspended from the club  you are done  but I was the sergeant at arms from before  and now I'm nothing?  can I be sergeant at arms now?  yes Ricky  are you a diamond club member?  yes  that means one every Tuesday so far?  yes you're four for four right?  yes 
[36:00]
 how do I?  alright  we got to get back to the tunes here but Anthony is clearing out his desk  where's the box?  he's clearing out his grand poobah box  I've got to put all my belongings in the box and I'm clearing out my grand poobah desk  this is embarrassing  you haven't heard the last from me?  don't forget the little bell  the rock of New York 1027WNW  the latest from the black crow is kicking my heart around 
[36:30]
 from their CD by your side which will be out in early January I believe  it's a grand poobah opi and suspended Tuesday night Hummer Club member Anthony  this is a joke  a two week suspension  farce  is in place  I don't care what you call it  I'm the grand poobah again  I know your motives  I know your motives opi  and I got my hat on?  I know what your motives were  my motives?  yes you got nervous when I said that there was a three month limit on membership 
[37:00]
 and you would have to re-up  knowing that you didn't even attain membership until this week  four weeks into the program  you knew that time would run out  in three months you probably wouldn't get another one  you would lose membership thus losing your poobah hat again  say what you want  say what you want  the people have spoken  no people have spoken  my people will support me  and I think you're showing a little disrespect to the grand poobah  enjoy your poobah people  who's a big one time member 
[37:30]
 ooh boy  there's your leader  they will be proud of me  it's like getting troops out there fighting a battle  hi N.E.W  all hail the mighty and true grand poobah  thank you  welcome back  thank you very much  we've missed you out here  well I miss being the grand poobah  and I promise I'll make you guys proud  absolutely I'm glad to hear that  I have one question though for you grand poobah  I meant to ask the other grand poobah  but being that he's such a dictator I was fearing him 
[38:00]
 so assuming that a hummer were to begin at approximately 12 midnight Monday  starting Tuesday morning  does that count?  no  it doesn't count?  no  why not?  no no no  you too huh?  for you grand poobah  I clearly state that membership will start from 3 o'clock on Tuesday  3 o'clock Tuesday afternoon  when we start our radio show  alright  alright  alright you missed me  maybe you missed this week then  you know I had four in a row going you know 
[38:30]
 good luck next week  yeah alright  enjoy your poobah  alright  see ya  hi N.E.W  yeah Opie  yes  I just have just one small problem with you being the grand poobah  I don't think you're experienced enough to be the grand poobah  right  doesn't matter  you know  just doesn't matter  I am now the grand poobah again  was this put to a vote by the people of the subject of your kingdom?  no no  Anthony set forth this whole law that I would become grand poobah once I obtained my hummer 
[39:00]
 and it happened last night finally  I'm going to point  oh ok  but this way at first people weren't you know they didn't warm up to Bill Clinton  but eventually they did  don't think  please  alright  well that's a bad example  tell all the queens to keep humming then  alright  I'm going to point myself grand high exalted mystic ruler  you are nothing you are a suspender for the club for two weeks  hi N.E.W  yeah hi 
[39:30]
 who's this  Opie grand poobah  hi now  this is Keith from the NHC  yes  national hummer club  ok  we have received your constitution yet to be a Tuesday night hummer club  we're looking at that and we've been hearing some things on the radio  have us a little worried as well  this infighting amongst members has got to stop  just remember hummers are there for everybody  yes  not just those  those grand poobah  and we'd like to see your constitution mailed out to us first thing tomorrow morning 
[40:00]
 I can handle that  get out of here  I can handle that  and who has the four foot hat at this time  that would be me Opie  and Anthony by the way is suspended from the club for two weeks  well first of all  he might get a life ban if he doesn't watch it  well let's not get out of line here  which means we're going to have to wire his wife's jaw shut  let's just remember you're only a local you're not a national  alright  and as far as being the grand poobah goes 
[40:30]
 let's make sure that whoever touches the hat is a member  if not the hat has to be burned in a ceremony  alright thanks man  bye  well everyone is checking in Anthony  bunch of loaded tapes  there you are a bunch of loaded tapes  so there you go  there you have it  yeah great  we will move on with more things now on our radio show  because order has been restored obviously  yeah sure  what does the instant feedback say  I'll get you grand poobah 
[41:00]
 what is the instant feedback saying Anthony  oh let's see  Opie, Opie, Opie  he's back  bravo  three cheers for Opie  long live the grand poobah  speech, speech  oh brother  hooray for Opie  it's about time  Anthony should  what  Anthony should what  should be beheaded  guys, lighten up  screw impeaching and behead him instead  he obviously doesn't need it 
[41:30]
 and ladies get that three month law out of your head  it's over  it's all over  alright  well  your laws will be set  well I want to thank Kevin  from New Jersey  for instantly emailing us Opie  because he has brought something up  that is very important and pertinent to this  I believe  if you listen to the tape from yesterday's show  you will hear that Opie  was the one who initially suggested a three month allowable time between hummers 
[42:00]
 Anthony's grand poobah made the rule  but Opie  initially suggested  the three month allowable time limit  check the tapes  don't know what you're talking about Anthony  and as grand poobah of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club  first Rick you're the sergeant at arms right  yeah  destroy the tape from yesterday  no no no no no  consider it done  okay it's done  tape's going to be destroyed right  tape is going to be no record of yesterday's show  and Anthony you are suspended for the rest of the month  get out of here  you can't do this  I can't show weakness as the grand poobah 
[42:30]
 I can't show weakness  grand poobah  I can't allow this  I've had it  I cannot allow this  I'll find  you are fighting my authority  I'll find the tapes  you lost the grand poobah hat  I'll find the tapes  fair and square  and show you to be the phony you are  doesn't matter  now you are suspended for the rest of the year  you must be in the dark hand  what  the rest of the year  I can't be  that's what three weeks  I can't show weakness  I'm sorry  I apologize for that 
[43:00]
 I do have a hard part  I got to lay down the law  1027 WNEW the Rock of New York  it's Opie and Anthony  thank you  I've got to ask you  have you started your Christmas shopping Anthony?  no  not a thing  you are a typical guy like myself  we still have what  three and a half weeks before  we truly panic  well you know how it ends up  me and you are in the mall  running around like mad men  yes  at the last minute  yeah 
[43:30]
 I've got to thank my friend Buzzy  from my college days  he came up with the best way to Christmas shop  he goes the day before Christmas  Christmas Eve  you go to the crowded mall  which is just horrendous and horrible  yeah  and it's a little thing he calls  buy a present have a beer  it works  by the time you get to shopping for grandma  you should see what you are picking out for  you are sauced  you are sauced  it doesn't matter  you are having fun  you don't care  you are online 
[44:00]
 we did that one year  it was hysterical  the sweaters he started buying for family members  were just brutal  this looks good  yeah  I don't know  I hate Christmas  I am going on record to say that  I'm not looking forward to it  once again this year  it's all a joke  it's lost its meaning  personally I think Christmas will be fun  when I get married and have kids  really?  and that could be another 10-15 years  unfortunately the way I'm going  I just hate it 
[44:30]
 I hate Christmas every year  do you feel the stress  that starts somewhere in the middle of your soul  and slowly completely takes over your body  before Christmas Eve  the panic starts setting in  slowly but surely  yeah I feel that  you don't know what to buy for your girlfriend or your wife  I hate buying gifts for my girlfriends  in the past  I would love like just gift certificates  but that's no  you can't get those  no no no  no meaning and feeling behind that 
[45:00]
 and you ladies  can you help us out  we don't like hints  guys do not like hints  tell us what the hell you want for Christmas  don't hint and say it doesn't matter  because we know it matters  right?  yeah  you know I always get hints  I get hints all through the year  and then after Christmas like  oh yeah well I asked about that in July  yeah you ladies  when when when  you ladies are great at that too  I don't remember that  remember that  we'll be on Cape Cod or in the Hamptons or something 
[45:30]
 and you'll see something in a window  and that's cute  and make some  yeah that's the hint too  oh that's cute  and it's August  I gave you a hint  hint?  they can look at something and go  that was it  and then like eight months later  you didn't pick that up?  pick up on that little  yeah  just give us the list of stuff you want  us guys will be so much happier right?  that is never going to work  and then we'll be a little creative  and come up with a couple things on our own 
[46:00]
 you have to have feeling  and it has to mean something when you get it  that you can't just go with a list Opie  you have to prove that you've thought this out  you're a sensitive guy  alright Anthony let me give you an example of feeling  did I ever tell you the Gucci bag story?  now fill me in on the Gucci bag story  alright when I first started going out with Sandy  who we heard on the radio about an hour ago  yes  like I said I don't like  just to try to figure it out  so I asked her what she wanted 
[46:30]
 she gave me a list of a couple things  stupid stuff  like a Madonna CD  that's easy I can do that  stuffed animal  no problem I can do that  cool  and on the list is Gucci bag  a Gucci bag?  Gucci bag  okay  alright  now us guys know  every year you have to come up with that special gift  for your wife or girlfriend right?  the big one you hand them last  the big one you hand them last  you give them all the little trinkets  and then here it is honey 
[47:00]
 so I go to the store and I pick out a Gucci bag  God knows I did not know there's a hundred different versions of Gucci bags  so I picked out one I thought she would like  I'm like she's going to freaking love this Gucci bag  look at it  I go home  Christmas is happening  and I pile up all the gifts  and make sure that Gucci bag which was wrapped perfectly  and then I put it on the bottom of the pile  of course  she opens up the Madonna CD she's happy  oh it's great  alright  she opens up the stuffed animal she loves it 
[47:30]
 a couple stupid sweaters I got her  love that  alright  going on and on with the gifts  and here comes the Gucci bag  so she's got the box  you're feeling good?  feeling good  Christmas is going well  the music is playing  we're drinking some eggnog  got the Yule log on channel 5  right  interrupting our opening of the gifts  there's some carolers out front  you know the scene  every year  I would say this is probably the perfect Christmas for you 
[48:00]
 perfect Christmas is looking good  I believe it was the first Christmas I spent with my lovely Sandy  this is great  so she's got the Gucci bag present on her lap  and now she opens it  she opens up the wrapping  and now she sees Gucci  now she's excited  she opens up the box  she's so excited  she sees the Gucci bag  she starts crying like crazy  crying  I'm like yeah I'm in man  I am in  that's nice  the crying continues  and continues  and this is what she says 
[48:30]
 it's ugly  it's ugly  wait a minute  they weren't tears of joy?  that's my Christmas  they weren't tears of joy?  no  the tears were  it's ugly  it's ugly  it's ugly  it's freaking ugly  bah humbug  I hate Christmas  so what happened?  what happened? 
[49:00]
 yeah with the rest of you  I didn't talk to her for like  oh no  I was so frustrated  so pissed  I swear I wrecked Christmas  wow really  and then I got myself together  I got here  then you look like a big turd  here's the receipt  oh the big present too  it's like the present  here's the receipt  here's the receipt  just take the bag  I don't even want a seat in the house  go to the mall  exchange it  get whatever the f you want  whew  heavy scene on Christmas 
[49:30]
 wow  brutal  I guess you don't like it  who knew that there was  a hundred different Gucci bags  well that's why  I'm not good at things like clothes  or something like a bag or shoes  because  look at me  look at me  I can't even dress myself  I'm going to pick out clothes  for someone else  I can't even dress myself nice  so I can't pick out clothes  gift certificates  they're a wonderful thing  I would love them  I would love a gift certificate  from like  CompUSA 
[50:00]
 that would make my Christmas  in a little envelope  oh thank you honey  I'm going to go get some computer stuff  right  so  there's my little lovely story  that's great  I hope this year it goes a little better  can't wait to find out  someone's on the hotline  hello  hello  Anthony  yeah  you just ruined my Christmas  why  because I brought my wife a Kate's bag  this year  a Kate's bag this year  five hundred bucks  and all I envision now  is what you've just described  well that was Opie  that was me Opie

[55:30]
 installed here where you can't do that  because that's a bowl  and  and  what one rule be in the grandpa now i control the buttons of the show  simple as that and it would pull  the  when you somehow get to be grandpa again i doubt it'll ever happen  you could control the buttons like the green lieutenant that the troops wanna  frag  because he comes out of west point but no no combat experience but he's gonna 
[56:00]
 lead the troops that's what you are you know what happens to those guys  they frag on  you know supposedly you have that you have some type of evidence  i will find the evidence i need to discredit you i read it was a little  yesterday's on tape  and the tape in this  if you're so innocent life  why destroy the tear that's good that's good we have no tape of yesterday's  sergeant arms i've taken care of my duty  yet we have no tape of yesterday's show and to the well let me sorry let me just
