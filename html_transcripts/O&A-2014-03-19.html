<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a discussion about the second day of their intern, Lady Di's, internship.  Her presence, both online and in the office, had generated significant positive and negative reactions.  A major point of discussion was an interview Lady Di had participated in with porn star Belle Knox.  Listeners reacted strongly to both the interview itself and to Lady Di's behavior, which included excessive alcohol consumption leading to vomiting and defecation in the SiriusXM office bathrooms.  The hosts detailed the resulting fallout, including conversations with management, and the measures implemented to manage Lady Di's behavior, such as constant supervision and escorted bathroom breaks. A clip of Lady Di recounting being anally penetrated in a car every weekend as a youth was played.  The podcast of the Belle Knox interview and other related video clips were promoted as being available online.

The show continued with a segment focusing on Lady Di's repeated bathroom incidents, detailed accounts of her defecating with the stall door open and vomiting, and her spending $140 (a portion of her given funds) on alcohol at TGI Fridays.  A call from Lady Di's friend, Marion, expressed concern about her alcohol abuse and urged her to seek help.  Lady Di was then brought into the studio for an interview, where she discussed her bathroom habits, alcohol consumption (including a 30-pack of beer and numerous beers at TGI Fridays), poor hygiene, and her ripped underwear, which was shown on-air.  She revealed she wore adult diapers "just in case" and had undertaken several unsuccessful alcohol detox attempts.  Her relationship with her roommate, Bill, and instances of calling the police on him over money disputes were also discussed.  Marion called back, reiterating her concerns and frustration with Lady Di's unwillingness to change. The segment concluded with further discussion of Lady Di's alcohol issues and the hosts' expressed responsibility for her wellbeing.

A caller, Diana, then joined the show.  The hosts and a female guest, Marianne, engaged in relentless teasing and berating of Diana regarding her substance abuse, inability to hold a job, use of adult diapers, and spending habits. The conversation became extremely vulgar and sexually explicit, detailing Diana’s past sexual experiences, including anal sex in a car. Marianne frequently interjected with sarcastic remarks and personal anecdotes.  The discussion shifted to the hosts and guests sharing personal stories about losing their virginity.  Comedian Colin Quinn joined the show and initially faced questions about his virginity before recounting a story about renting out his apartment and finding it the scene of a large, chaotic orgy upon his return. He described the damage and his subsequent dealings with authorities and the rental platform.  Further jokes about Diana and Colin’s experiences concluded this segment, with a brief mention of an upcoming guest.

The next segment featured a discussion about comedian Ari Teman's Airbnb orgy, which unexpectedly boosted his career and led to the hashtag #AirbnbFreakFest trending. The hosts then joked about the death (or near-death) of Fred Phelps, founder of the Westboro Baptist Church, and how Teman's orgy overshadowed the news. A significant portion of the show was then dedicated to a $98 million lawsuit settlement between New York City and minority firefighter applicants who claimed the FDNY entrance exam was racially biased. The hosts expressed skepticism and anger towards Mayor de Blasio's decision, questioning the validity of the bias claims and highlighting the city's financial issues. Numerous callers, including firefighters and a psychologist, offered various perspectives on the lawsuit and the FDNY exam, debating the potential for cultural bias within the test and discussing a "popcorn effect" in minority hiring.

The show concluded with a recurring segment featuring Lady Di and Marion, focusing on Marion's diaper use, diarrhea, and a generally chaotic and vulgar exchange about her lifestyle choices.  The hosts then wrapped up the show with various jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I've been laughing since I got here.  Oh my god.  Good morning everyone.  Bomony.  Hey.  Hey everybody.  I deleted, I deleted, I tweeted in the afternoon yesterday that controversy has hit the Opie  and Anthony show.  Controversa.  As far as Lady Di's internship goes.  And, um, don't have to tease it.  Lady Di is here. 
[00:00:30]  Yes.  But for most of the afternoon yesterday, there was a strong possibility that she was not  going to be here.  Right.  And that Sirius XM was going to pull the plug on Lady Di's internship.  And, uh, you know, I like to joke and stuff that I'm a bit younger than I am, but the  fact is we're, we're middle-aged men dealing with some ridiculous things.  Such ridiculous things that, that no one deals with on their jobs. 
[00:01:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah.  So day two of, uh, Lady Di's internship was a huge success.  Oh, was it ever?  For the most part.  You know, you got the, you got the haters that'll always try to pick something apart and try  to get something going.  But the fact is, uh, overwhelmingly people are loving Lady Di as an intern.  People loved it.  And, uh.  Her interviewing skills.  She was great.  With Bell Knox were, uh, it was hilarious.  Can I explain, um, you know, Radio 101 to some of these dopes? 
[00:01:30]  Give it a try.  I retweeted one of your tweets because you said it perfectly.  Now, the Bell, the Bell Knox interview was, was a good, strong, solid interview.  Some people wish we, uh, attacked her or, or, you know, went after her a little bit.  The kid's sitting there.  Yeah, for what, though?  That was, that was, yeah.  Yeah, for what?  She's 18 and she looks like she could be 15.  Yeah, yeah.  And, uh, whatever.  I mean, whatever.  She's hot and she does face fuck porn.  Let's get her.  Yeah.  Oh. 
[00:02:00]  But people want us to kind of go after the fact that she's not as innocent as she comes  across.  Who cares?  I don't think she comes across innocent.  I think she's a bit naive.  I think she's going to, I think she's going to regret a lot of things in the next few years.  But I think she, um, she found her way into porn.  These days, these days you can't just be a porn star.  You're going to be just lost.  You need an angle.  You need an angle.  She figured out her angle.  I think her angle's bullshit.  I really do.  And we asked her that. 
[00:02:30]  And she answered the questions.  What are we going to do?  Keep going, you know, after?  My, you.  She wanted to be in porn and she figured out somehow that if, uh, she gets, you know,  the word out there that she's doing this to pay for college, that's a national story,  which it, which it became.  Became viral, as they say.  But I think the more, the more and more you get into it with her, it's obvious she just wants  to be in porn.  It has to be in porn.  She got some popularity.  Now she's striking while the iron's hot with, uh, all kinds of merchandising and, and, and 
[00:03:00]  appearances.  Yeah.  Good for her.  So who are we?  I mean, we asked all the questions.  She answered them, but you know, aren't you a disgrace to your family?  Who cares?  And these dummies are like, that was white knight.  What?  White knight.  Well, I hate.  She was nice.  She was honest.  I mean, she fucking was sexy.  Sweet, sexy girl.  I hate when, uh, some of these listeners take some of these terms and things we come up  with and then use them wrong.  I know.  Yeah.  That wasn't a white knight situation. 
[00:03:30]  That was nothing like a white knight.  She's not even close.  Nothing.  Right.  You know, we talked about her parents and her father and stuff.  Right.  Uh, anyway.  So it was, it was a good interview.  Most people enjoyed it.  We're supposed to judge.  We're supposed to sit in here in judgment of anybody.  Look at us.  She'll go away.  Yeah.  She'll go away quickly too, by the way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This has one of those quick peaks.  This has a short, uh, shelf life.  Yeah.  And the reason is because she's all right. 
[00:04:00]  You know.  Yeah.  I didn't want to say it to her face, but there's, there's girls way hotter doing porn  than her.  She fits into a, uh, into a niche, which, or niche, as some people say.  Uh, which I, I find very attractive.  I thought she was very cute.  Very sexy.  Very sexy girl.  She's dirty.  She's all right.  College.  But the, there's girls that are, you know, hotter doing it.  Yeah, but it, you know, it's, it's, what's your, whatever your type is.  Right.  That's like my type.  But right now.  I liked her a lot.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  She's fucking sexy.  Yeah.  Oh, you guys. 
[00:04:30]  She's sexy.  I, I, you could, you could try to talk that down.  Oh, me and Jimmy are going, right?  Wow.  There's hotter chicks doing anything.  There's hotter chicks in fucking science school somewhere.  No.  I wanted to eat her ass after she fucking rode a bike without a seat.  Yes.  She was fantastic.  But the point is, she's not going to have longevity in the business.  She found her niche and she'll ride it out for a little while.  And I figure she'll do all right within a year or so.  That's it.  Yeah.  That's it.  It's going to be quick for her.  But I thought we had a pretty good interview with her.  And then what you do as radio hosts, you're like, okay, we either say, uh, it's so long. 
[00:05:00]  Thanks for coming by.  Or you figure out, you know, in front of your eyes, if there's anything else you could do  with the situation.  Right.  And having Lady Di as an intern, we invited her in going, okay, let's see if there's  something else here.  And then the dynamics of Lady Di in studio with, uh, the young, hot porn star was beautiful.  And, and people really enjoyed it.  But I saw one of the tweets that someone sent you and I just retweeted it.  What'd you, what'd you say?  It was, uh, if you, it was pretty much if you don't, um, understand what we were doing. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  Uh, oh, I think he said something like, why would you bring Lady Di in?  Right.  That's what he was saying.  While she was in there, ignoring the fact that she was in here by herself for 45 minutes,  probably 40 minutes.  I don't know.  And it's, if you don't, if you don't understand why we did that, then you probably, the show  is not for you.  Yeah.  This program is not for you.  Right.  We, you know, we've, we've pretty much figured out what this show was about over the years. 
[00:06:00]  Leave it, leave it to us.  Don't, don't worry so much.  Yeah.  Cause that's exactly what it was.  Uh, 45 minutes of, of her and, uh, talking about all kinds of things.  And then Lady Di comes in asking these ludicrous questions.  Right.  Uh, just, just ugly and up the joint.  Right.  It was perfect.  And yeah, she put the whole thing over the top.  Yes.  Yay.  No, I loved it.  I have no regrets having Lady Di come out at the end of that interview.  It was, it was great.  And they played it like the girl and, uh, Belle played as well. 
[00:06:30]  She wasn't mad.  She got it.  She was having fun with it.  There was a natural reaction too.  There's this girl that's very sweet to everybody, wants to give everyone a chance and, uh, you know, and, and, and by the end of it, she was annoyed with Lady Di in the same way we all get annoyed with her.  To hear her going, oh my God, tell the story.  No.  She's yelling at her the same shit we've yelled at her for years.  It's like, God damn, she's affected her.  Right.  So.  It was beautiful.  So there you go. 
[00:07:00]  Whatever.  Yeah.  I thought we did all right with Belle Knox.  Yeah.  I'm not going to sit here and beat up an 18 year old.  No, she was, she's what she is.  No reason.  No reason.  A chick that's doing porn is not automatically a target because she does porn.  All these guys make me sick with that.  Like, why didn't you go after her for what?  Yeah.  What do you go after her?  What do you mean?  Should we dig into her understory?  Wait a minute.  That's not concerning.  Maybe we should bring an actor in and scream at them because they're not the same age as they are on Wikipedia.  And watch every other interview she's done with peers and, and, and, and. 
[00:07:30]  It's all the same.  That's what they were doing.  They were scolding her pretty much.  Well, I, yeah, I don't know.  I don't care what she does.  I don't either.  She's all about to go to the military.  Great.  I know we asked every question.  Face fucking.  Should have been asked, so.  That sweet face with a big dick in it.  Oh, come on.  Thank you.  I know, Jimmy.  But for her to talk like that, like she was talking about, like, I love a big dick.  And then you watch the videos, like, she means it.  Oh, dude.  That was so hot, dude.  I think I'm officially getting old.  Oh, she'd like to get fucked. 
[00:08:00]  She's young, man.  18 is fine with me.  She's young, man.  That's fine.  18 is okay.  Believe me.  I don't like it young, like young girls, but 18 years old, again, you can be put to death.  Legal tender.  You're old enough to have sex with.  Fine.  Absolutely.  18, please.  I'll have to be the party pooper.  I felt extremely.  Well, you know what?  Extremely old yesterday.  You have a daughter.  You have a daughter.  That instantly changes a lot of guys' attitudes because they, they somehow put that whole situation 
[00:08:30]  now into this reality segment.  I mean, our own Travis, I had commented on his, his young daughter on the pole in the  subway, commented the fact that your job is to keep her off the pole.  It was an adorable little photograph.  But, but then my wife replies back saying, I already made that joke.  So, you know.  Oh, jeez.  Really?  It's Lisa.  It's true.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Yeah, it's adorable.  Very cute picture.  She looks like she's having a ball there. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, she was going to see Kermie.  Yeah, she was on her way to meet Kermit the Frog.  Oh, well, I think you should have been better behaved than that.  Kermit the Frog.  I know, that is true.  That's the way people get hurt.  Did she meet Evil Kermit or the regular Kermit?  No, Constantine.  Kermit.  Oh.  It was the nice Kermit.  And then, of course, had to have the E-Rock picture.  What's the E-Rock picture?  With Kermit.  It was all nice.  I see, like, you know, little Riley and Lynn Lisa with Kermit.  And then, and then E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock. 
[00:09:30]  God.  Ew, what a.  He's hamming it up in that picture.  I probably wouldn't have taken one.  Did you take one second?  I got a photo with Kermit.  It's Kermit.  He rules.  Don't act like.  Hold on.  Why would you.  Don't act like you're the, you're the.  Travis, actually, he's the fuckly.  Hey, look, if I get it.  Travis, I got a photo with Kermit.  He's the litmus test.  You know what?  I've rarely seen a line that long to get photos of people.  Really?  Quite a dork.  Was it the actual guy, though?  Yes.  Yeah.  The actual voice?  Because I got the exact same Kermit doll at home. 
[00:10:00]  I could bring him in here.  You could just do that.  And we could get our Kermit pictures.  Right.  And I'm going to tell everyone this was the actual Kermit.  No one would be able to tell the difference.  I got the exact Kermit at home.  Look at Who kid with Kermit.  I interviewed him.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, it'll be on this channel, Thursday at midnight.  How was it?  Thursday at midnight?  Why that time?  And then Sunday at 3 p.m.  What the hell's going on with this channel?  I don't know.  What I do is I get, like, really good interviews, and then they put them on Thursday at midnight.  And then they sneak them in somewhere?  Yeah.  No, you're fucking piling them up, though, for your fucking tape. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, what?  Of course.  What?  Exactly.  That's a resume.  I don't save them.  How long is the interview?  20 minutes.  So why don't we just throw it on an after show or something?  Oh, boy.  Put it on wherever you want.  I think down the hall probably wouldn't like that.  Who cares?  He asked Kermit about moisture.  He said he had a funny response to the moisture question.  He did.  Oh, really?  Did Who kid call him his nigga?  Who kid refrain from use of the N-word?  He did?  Too much respect for Kermit.  Wow.  I think.  He might have said it once, actually. 
[00:11:00]  You my green nigga.  My frog nigga.  People won't let the Bill Nox thing go.  What?  They're frustrated because she thinks she's so smart.  Who cares?  Richard in Florida.  And then Richard in Florida.  Go ahead, Richard.  We don't get what.  Go ahead.  Well, basically, the viewers don't like her because she's a porn star.  They don't like her because she's being a blatant hypocrite.  Because she's championing feminism. 
[00:11:30]  And, you know, there's a huge hypocrisy there, obviously.  Of course.  But is there?  Yeah.  Or is it just the idea of what feminism is supposed to mean?  I think it's a delusional thing.  I don't think it's a hypocrisy.  Hypocrisy is different.  I think hypocrisy is you know that you're contradicting one thing with another.  I think she's naive.  And I think she's delusional to think that what she's doing is this empowering thing and feminist thing.  It's being looked at by men in a way that makes a woman look degraded, period. 
[00:12:00]  If there's one guy out of a million that thinks it's empowering, God, more power to you.  Because it's just a degrading thing to do to a woman.  I wasn't taking that feminism thing too seriously at all.  No.  I let her say what she had to say about it.  But you're not going to talk her out of it.  Right.  In a couple of years, believe me, the difference between 18 and fucking 22 and stuff, girls learn a lot in that. 
[00:12:30]  And I think she's going to learn that, like, oh, God, what was I thinking?  Ew, I said that.  Right.  Yeah.  It is what it is.  It is what it is.  But, dude, what's her hypocrisy?  Let's hear this.  The hypocrisy.  Go ahead, sir.  All right, Jimmy.  No need for the hostility.  I'm just trying to get my point out.  Oh, hostile Jimmy.  I wouldn't say it's hostility.  It's just irritation at this fucking...  When people have this thing with porn girls, and it happens all the time, and it's just so silly. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  It's like the entire country...  They do more business than anything Hollywood's ever done.  And all people do is go, well, how could she do that?  It's just this fucking...  Yeah.  Jimmy, did you see the facial abuse video?  I've seen you have.  I've seen enough of them, though.  The only thing that annoyed me was when she said that they...  And I guess maybe that's the new thing.  When she said they were like, they said, like, you were molested.  Decred, yeah.  And it's like, ugh. 
[00:13:30]  You can do that if you want to, but what guy wants to jerk off to that?  No.  Right.  I don't want to hear anything like that.  Don't get me wrong.  You know, Bell Knox is cool.  She's my kind of girl.  You know, except for the small fact that a feminist doing facial abuse for women's rights is like a rabbi going to Auschwitz for a free shower.  Oh, shit, nigga.  But it's not that.  Because the idea is, wasn't feminism supposed to be bra-burning and empowering and things like that?  So if you want to do porn, and you can make a lot of money doing porn, and you're a submissive sexual person, what is the terrible part of that? 
[00:14:00]  It just seemed like there's such a double standard in her viewpoint that, you know, she totally believes in the whole thing of equality.  You know, only outside the realm of pornography.  Look, if she's got to rationalize it any way she has to to fucking go to sleep at night.  I see this guy's point a little bit.  It's hard to get your feminist.  It is.  Feminism point across when you're so far into the porn with the facial abuse. 
[00:14:30]  But who's buying that?  Of course, anyone that hears her say it is going, oh, boy, really?  There's not one person that's thinking, yeah, that's a great way to empower your feminist side.  But then you go to the other side, though, and feminists are going, hey, don't say bossy.  It's like, what is true feminism?  What is empowerment and what is not empowerment?  I don't think pornography is empowering.  No, it's not.  Taking loads on the face, it's tough for me to see that's empowering for a woman. 
[00:15:00]  Huh?  And she kind of went into this diatribe about capitalism and stuff, and I kind of felt like that was a big deflection.  But was it a diatribe, or was she just saying that's one reason she does it, is because of capitalism?  Oh, she was saying that's why women make more in porn than guys.  That was the one thing she was saying that I did kind of feel that it was right, is the economics of it.  That was fine.  Everything else, though, the whole, you know, white empowerment shit and the fucking feminism.  That's just feminism, it's an 18-year-old college student talking, regurgitating the shit they hear from their fucking friends and professors. 
[00:15:30]  But what am I going to do, sit here and debate?  I'm not going to debate you, Jerry.  This is not a debate.  I didn't go away from that bothered.  Right.  I didn't believe her points.  Of course.  But we ask the questions, and that's it.  Yeah.  And then it's up to you to decide.  Yeah.  Right.  And then we try to have fun with it, the damn thing. 
[00:16:00]  It's like arguing with a fucking six-year-old that the blue balloon is better than the red one.  It's not going to get anywhere.  But when people called up with that, when she said about why do women make more than men,  they were trying to get her, like, well, how come you're for equality, but, like, just not understanding that basic thing.  Yeah.  Because women don't spend as much watching that stuff on good-looking guys as guys do with women.  That's why there's a lot more female prostitutes, because we pay for it.  Right.  They don't.  Exactly.  Go ahead, sir.  I'm sorry.  I'm here, Roger.  I don't know why everyone's bothered by it, though. 
[00:16:30]  Who cares?  Who cares?  I don't think anyone's believing the fact that she had to do porn to pay for her tuition at this point.  They wanted a pile on for some reason.  She found an angle where she could be popular in the porn world.  I think everyone knows that now.  Did you like it, Jimmy, when she was talking about her fat pussy?  It drove me crazy.  Oh, I saw you were going nuts.  But how many girls do we interview that won't talk about stuff like that?  Oh, I don't know.  But she's just sitting there going, yeah, I have a really fat pussy.  I have a fat pussy.  I like a big dick in my mouth. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, it'll be.  There's something great about that.  It was open.  That's what I like in a girl.  Yes.  I don't like Jenna Jameson for that, for sure.  Well, Jenna's been down a different road, dude.  I mean, she's having a rough time.  Long and winding road.  She's all banged up now.  She is banged up.  A lot of these girls, oh, they're fucking living to Jenna because she fucking really blew the doors off as far as what you can do with being a porn star.  Yeah.  As far as being a true star.  No one's going to do it like she did.  The world has changed.  She's all fucked up.  Bill Knox will have a good year, maybe a good two years, and that's it. 
[00:17:30]  And then it kind of goes down to some other level.  It depends on what you do with it when you have it.  Like, if you take it and make it something more, you can have longevity.  Right.  But if your movies aren't good, you won't.  Yeah.  When you can get porn anywhere now for free, it's going to be tough for her to make money, but she figured out a way to make money now.  Yeah.  With this Duke angle.  Like, James Dean's a rare case of a guy whose name you know.  Like, he's one of those weird dudes that everyone knows. 
[00:18:00]  But there's still enough women.  Sorry.  That's right.  That woman, she's in one of the Blue Angels jets.  And she's all fucked up.  She's not out.  She's fucking blacked out.  It's the view of the back seat of the plane.  Yeah.  Would you do that?  F-18?  Oh, I don't know.  I'd be...  I don't know.  I should not puke.  I'd literally be afraid that I was going to drop dead right back there in the seat.  But look at the view you got.  That's amazing.  That would scare me, dude.  That would scare me.  You feel like you're just zipping through the fucking air. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, these guys are badasses.  Amazing.  They even walk like badasses.  Right?  The Blue Angels.  Nice.  That's so cool.  All right, brother.  We got to move on.  All right, Richard?  All right, let me just say, we also didn't kind of like how you sort of threw away the  Bob Levy thing, which was the highlight of the interview.  That was hilarious.  Really?  Really?  I didn't think it was the highlight of the interview.  What was hilarious about it?  Bob Levy?  I fucking fell out of my chair.  Bob Levy is a very funny guy, but I don't know.  It seemed a little forced, to be honest with you. 
[00:19:00]  What?  That and when the dude, who was like all nervous, called up from Goodfellas?  So you like the two guys' phone calls more than the interview with the 18-year-old who  likes nine-inch dicks in her mouth.  Good.  Who's this girl that went with the Blue Angels?  She's pretty cute.  All right, brother.  Sorry we didn't give enough attention to the male phone calls, Richard.  While we were busy talking about the growth of fat pussy lips.  You moe.  Yeah, the Bob Levy thing was all right.  It wasn't the highlight.  Whatever.  Who's this?  She thought it was the highlight that's fucking hot. 
[00:19:30]  She's on Fox News with the Blue Angels.  Is that who, uh...  She gets knocked the fuck out.  Here we go.  Ready, hit it.  Oh my god.  Wow.  What an ascent that is.  That's a rocket.  Look how fast they climb.  How was that?  Awesome.  Just like a computer.  Commercial flight, right?  Because your pilot always asks you to help break the sound barrier.  Go for it.  All the way forward.  Keep going.  Keep going.  There's a full afterburner.  There's the clock started.  We're going to get a little bit light in your seat. 
[00:20:00]  And there we go.  Off to keep.  Off to keep.  25 seconds.  Off to keep.  0.8 mach, 550 knots.  Damn.  And there's the speed of sound.  1.02.  And we're just getting started.  I would never do that.  Just spinning in circles.  Jeez, that looks intense.  Yeah.  I would tell them to slow down.  Yeah, whipping around the desert.  You know what a buzz kill I'd be in that thing?  You wouldn't like it?  No.  No slower, sir.  A buzz kill.  Jesus. 
[00:20:30]  At least you didn't throw up.  Oh, three times.  Yeah.  Two times.  Okay, yeah, yeah.  I'm going to show it in the back.  What happened, Maria?  Where were you exactly when you passed out?  We were out.  We had just done six Gs.  Oh, my goodness.  So, basically six times the force of gravity.  And that's the reason why I passed out.  Because it pulled the blood from my brain down.  I love it.  You were supposed to be doing this hip maneuver where you tense your muscles.  Oh, man.  Her head goes flopping.  But they forgot I don't have much muscle.  It didn't work out.  There was no wall. 
[00:21:00]  And then with her hands.  She's doing jazz hands.  Jazz hands.  Whatever.  What did Rogan say they do?  They force you.  Yeah, they go up into their head.  You've got to go like.  Should I keep the blood in your head?  Oh, yeah.  I don't.  It's an exercise.  Those guys are goofballs, aren't they?  Yeah.  The guys on Fox and Friends.  They are goofy.  They're fans of the show, though, right?  The one guy I think we had in.  Yeah, he was cool.  Not as goofy as that other Fox station.  What?  Blast it. 
[00:21:30]  You didn't get those videos.  That is so fucking funny.  I really wish someone would have tweeted me.  That's how I would have been aware before today's show that a dick pic was on the news.  Oh, I got that tweet a lot.  That was so blatant, too.  It wasn't something in the background or a little fucking thing.  It was just a big dick pic.  Yeah.  Front and center on their screen.  You think someone's fired for that?  People have to realize she's 18 years old.  These aren't words of wisdom that's coming out of her. 
[00:22:00]  Take anyone else at 18 and put their words out there.  That's why I joke about it.  She's in the Opster years.  Oh!  I thought I could rule the world at her age.  The Opster years!  And then you look back and you're like, ugh, what a douchebag you were.  It would be a good TV series.  The Opster years.  The Opster years.  But that's what she's in.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, you think you just know more than your elders.  Uh-huh.  Know more than your parents.  I got you.  Just know more than anyone around you.  And then only time takes care of that. 
[00:22:30]  And you look back and go, ugh, God, what was I thinking?  Oh, what an asshole.  Even early on in our run together.  Yeah.  You know, we play the audio every once in a while.  We thought we were doing the greatest shit ever on radio.  Yes.  And then you look back and realize, oh, God, who the fuck would ever listen to this shit?  That's what happens.  You get life experience, right?  Yeah.  I thought that was just obvious to everybody, if you're, you know, talking to an 18-year-old.  It would have been very hard to beat up on her for something, but, you know, whatever. 
[00:23:00]  Whatever.  I mean, you know, whatever.  If that's what you're thinking about, that's fine, too.  Yeah.  We were just trying to explain ourselves this morning, and if you still think otherwise, that's fine.  God, then go fuck yourself.  I don't need to turn everyone's opinion.  That's fine.  Yeah.  No, we should have really grilled her.  We should have grilled her.  Get her crying.  Yeah.  It'll be good.  Let's see.  I want a liquor box.  Jesus.  Sorry.  I did.  I want to dig right in. 
[00:23:30]  I want it to as well.  Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.  God, it was nice.  Nom, nom, nom.  Fucking big, fat one.  I saw pictures of it.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Let's see.  All right.  I'd come at her.  I would take a chance on not going to rock it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just fucking bury it deep and just fucking unleash.  Absolutely.  Unleash hell.  I'm not on the pill.  I know.  I understand.  Oh, don't worry.  Grab that ass.  I'm very furtile.  No, no.  I understand.  Oh, it's all right.  People are... 
[00:24:00]  All right.  One more.  Caporsh.  Steve in Chicago.  Yes.  I'm just not sure why you guys aren't addressing the most annoying part of that interview yesterday  with that fucking cunt that was in there that was just interrupting you.  Oh, Mandy.  Yeah, a lot of people were frustrated by Mandy, but I think she controlled the interview pretty  well for us.  Yeah, she wanted to get shit out there.  Maybe she talked a little too much, but I didn't mind her at all.  She was steering her client. 
[00:24:30]  I know a lot of people did mind, though.  Yeah.  I got to point that out, but she was asking some of the questions we probably wouldn't  have asked ourselves.  Yeah, and she was having her elaborate on stuff, because she knew more of the story  than we did, so it was basically just like having somebody who knew more of the story  than we did.  But she did it.  She did it the way that was just annoying.  One minute she's doing the interviewing, that's the minute she's trying to be interviewed,  and she's trying to pull things out of her.  It was just an inappropriate time.  It's just, you guys do what you do. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, a lot of people had comments about that.  Yeah.  Nah, wait, Gundo.  Yeah, they said it makes Belle's comfortable with her, and she was like, all right, fine.  All right.  I like Mandy, so I didn't mind it.  By the way...  Fun.  All right, thanks, brother.  All right.  By the way, that interview is this week's podcast.  Oh.  Oh, we did a last-minute switcheroo, and, you know, Wednesday's podcast day, the Opie  and Anthony podcast.  You can get it through iTunes.  I think the link's on our Facebook page.  Did we tweet out the link, too, Sam Roberts? 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, it's up on ONAshow on Twitter.  On Twitter is the link, and it's the Belle Knox interview with Lady Di as well.  So you can listen to it for yourself and, you know, decide.  You decide.  It was good, bad, indifferent, sexy, funny.  Yeah.  I think it was a little of all those things, so go check it out.  And I threw up a couple quick clips on my YouTube channel, so if you want some new Opie  radio on the YouTube, I'll tweet out the links during the break, I guess. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  So we got food, so why don't we eat?  And then we'll get into, we started this show kind of talking about Lady Di, and then we  got off track a little bit, but we'll explain the whole Lady Di controversy.  Drama.  It's drama.  They did not want her in this building today.  Nope.  And I won't tell you why.  And there wasn't a fight or anything, but there was, you know, I had to hit some people  with some logic yesterday afternoon, and we got it done. 
[00:26:30]  We got it done.  But if she does what she did yesterday, then boy, am I in trouble and a lot of other people.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You put your neck out.  You're vouching.  A little bit.  We'll explain next.  Randy Rhodes.  Oh, God.  Randy Rhodes Day.  What's his day?  Mark 52?  82.  He was only 25.  Died 32 years ago.  Jesus.  I think he was 26.  Am I crazy?  Oh, you would know.  Geez.  Oh, he was 25.  Okay, I thought he was 25.  25, 26.  So he would only be 57, 58. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Obviously, that's his one regret, like of all the things he's done in his life.  What?  Was that he wasn't awake to stop Randy from getting on that.  They asked him recently, I think, because his regrets, he said just that, that he wasn't  awake to stop him from getting on that dumb little plane.  In other Jim Norton rock news, it's all about Jim Norton's fans today.  The original members of KISS will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 
[00:27:30]  Only the original.  So they are doing it.  I don't know if they're all going to be there.  They will.  When is that?  I don't know.  Soon, right?  April, maybe?  It's in mid-April.  Yeah, mid-April.  I want to know that.  That broke overnight.  Only the original members, so they're not going with the other guys.  Nah.  Yeah, I haven't.  Which is strange, because those other guys have been in the band for a very long time  as well.  Yeah.  April 10th?  April 10th, so we're getting close, Jimmy.  They're not going to play, though, or anything. 
[00:28:00]  I don't know about that.  They keep saying that.  Oh, yeah?  But I'm going to tell you, man, there's a lot of money to be made in a greatest, that's  what these bands do, there's greatest hits records come out, and they're just on everybody's  radar at that moment.  They will play.  They might play, dude.  They will figure it out.  They'll play rock and roll all night, and maybe, you know, Detroit Rock City.  Will they also party every day?  They're a little bit older now, maybe.  Ah.  It's good to see these one-hit wonder bands, you know, entering the Rock and Roll Hall of  Fame.  It's April 10th, and I'm roasting cowhead nut. 
[00:28:30]  Who's this cowhead?  No offense.  Cowhead.  What?  He's a radio friend.  Damn it, I'll be gone.  Cowhead roast.  What's a cowhead roast?  I don't get it.  It's a man.  Is he cool?  He's the man.  All right.  We don't mind people that are cool.  He is cool.  So, Lady Di.  Go on his show.  I would love to.  We would love you, too.  How do we do this Lady Di thing?  Do we start with...  Lady Di.  I don't know the updates.  You guys haven't been to say, let's save it for the year.  I really don't know exactly what happened. 
[00:29:00]  Well, do we start with the Don Wicklund phone call, or do we go over what happened yesterday  in detail?  I think we have to go over with...  I think we have to go over what happened.  Yeah.  Let's start there.  Yeah.  So, most of you know that Lady Di has been interning with us this week.  Yep.  By the way, I have to officially say, I completely understand why she hasn't had a job in a very,  very long time.  And I will not be yelling at her about getting a job anymore.  No.  Because this woman cannot hold a job.  It's so obvious to everyone around here. 
[00:29:30]  She needs rehab or something.  We're trying to get Dr. Steve to fly up last minute to end the Lady Di week within a full  examination.  Full exam.  He says he can fly up late Thursday, do something on Friday morning, and then he has to fly back  to Tennessee because he's doing his 100th podcast in front of a live audience, which  is pretty cool for him.  Yeah.  I got to be back.  Oh, he said he could use miles.  Really?  All right.  Start looking up flights for late Thursday, late tomorrow. 
[00:30:00]  I'll fly up.  I'll use my miles.  But hopefully there's not a blackout day.  He says what she really needs is blood work.  We understand that.  Well, yeah.  But, I mean, a basic physical exam.  And we mean a physical exam.  Oh, no.  He can't do that.  We want to check her prostate.  Well, you know, most people would beg to differ, but I don't think she has one. 
[00:30:30]  You sure?  Yeah.  You sure?  It could be.  I think if Dr. Steve's coming here, though, he's got to make sure she doesn't have a...  Is it prostrate?  Prostate?  Prostate.  I would put the R in there.  Prostate.  Right.  Let me scroll to Anthony.  Why would you help him?  Oh, that's true.  If someone wants to say prostrate, I would never tell them the truth.  Yes.  I've made that mistake my entire life.  I've made prostate mistakes to my friend.  Prostates.  It's the way Archie Bunker would say.  Prostrate.  Prostrate.  Plenty of girls have prostates. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, do they?  Oh, boy.  And then if this was a script, it would say, Jim looks down and eats oatmeal.  He's saying he could use miles.  And a nice physical exam would be wonderful for Friday morning.  It'd be awesome.  Yeah.  So let's start looking up flights.  We have been.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Okay.  So I guess it was very obvious yesterday that she probably goes through withdrawals if she  doesn't have alcohol.  Because the first day of her internship, she did admit she had a couple of 90 ices before 
[00:31:30]  she got here.  And she was, you know, she was functioning.  She didn't have that.  She was still in bad shape, though.  She didn't have that horrendous cough.  She wasn't leaking from every part of her body.  Well, she was winded.  She was snotty and her eyes were running.  But not as bad as yesterday.  Not as bad as yesterday.  Okay.  And yesterday, the difference with yesterday was that she didn't have any natty ices before  she got in here.  So she had the runs.  She peed herself.  She peed herself. 
[00:32:00]  She was puking more than I realized.  She was vomiting.  How many times did she vomit during the show yesterday?  She won't admit it, but at least four.  And she doesn't have the flu or food poisoning.  She went to TGIF.  And I'm sure the boys at TGIF are not happy that we're mentioning this.  But she did go there for a few beers on Monday.  She didn't eat the food.  So she didn't get sick from TGIF.  No, she went there for beers.  And apparently she went there again yesterday for beers.  And she made a lot of money yesterday. 
[00:32:30]  And supposedly she spent all of it at TGIF.  Yeah, 140 clams.  We gave her $140 for the privilege of looking at her soiled panties.  Oh, that video is up on my YouTube channel as well.  I'll tweet that one as well.  That was brutal.  She took the $140, went to TGIF Fridays.  And I'm hearing today she has $10 left.  Well, because Marion called what?  The pre-show?  Yeah, Marion was on the phone on the pre-show and said that she talked to Di last night.  Or yesterday afternoon. 
[00:33:00]  And Di was all giggly.  And she was at the bar at TGIF Fridays.  And she had $10 left for the $140.  Do we have that phone call?  We can grab it real quick.  Yeah, let's grab that Marion phone call.  Which is strange because she was trying to hit me up for more money on the way out.  Was she?  Saying, I really need it.  You don't need it that bad if you're taking the $140 and spending all of it.  She's wasting it on beer.  Before you even get home.  $7 beers at TGIF Fridays in Times Square.  How do you spend most of it? 
[00:33:30]  $7.  $7.  $10 beers is $70.  Let's say $10 a beer if she's tipping.  That's 14 beers.  She ate something maybe?  She might eat something.  I doubt it.  I don't think.  She doesn't like to eat.  That's how bad she's.  Maybe she bought other stuff.  Yeah, maybe.  She has homeless person drinking habits.  Oh, yeah.  She's in really bad shape.  Yeah, really bad.  Yeah, which is kind of sad because this started out as a real fun little thing to do this week.  So I guess she puked at least four times. 
[00:34:00]  She had the runs yesterday, and we thought it was hilarious.  Thank God we didn't try to tape her in the bathroom, by the way.  That was a good move.  Yeah.  Because she would not be here today.  But I heard that she was puking in the sink, but she was puking in the sink the whole time.  Yeah.  And she said she doesn't like puking in the toilet.  The problem is it's a corporate bathroom for females, by the way, which is a little different than males.  To share space.  Men will deal with a little more in a bathroom situation than women. 
[00:34:30]  Wait, she was vomiting in the sink because she doesn't like it?  I thought she had an accent.  No, she doesn't like vomiting in toilets.  They're made for number one and number two, she says.  So the vomit was so bad in the sink that the building got involved.  And by the way, those sinks, they have the drains are like a little grate.  They're not those plug drains, are they?  No, it stopped up the sink.  It stops up the sink. 
[00:35:00]  How bad?  Terrible.  It was to the point.  Chunks were in there, right?  It didn't really come to full fruition until just as the show was ending.  Like, the cleaning lady, this poor woman, who sits at the show, all she does is clean.  What do you mean, poor woman?  She cleans bathrooms.  Well, she should have paid attention in school.  You're damn right.  What do you mean, poor woman?  Fucking A.  That's our problem?  Exactly.  She doesn't expect to have to come in and literally have to be on guard outside that one bathroom. 
[00:35:30]  And every time Lady Di goes in, because Lady Di would go in towards the end, and I'd be outside the bathroom.  Right.  And one minute after Lady Di entered, four women would come running out.  Oh, shit.  Like Godzilla was attacking.  They were not happy.  It's safe to say, once again, this entire floor hates us.  Yes.  Hates us.  Yes.  Again.  But what are they doing? 
[00:36:00]  Well, they're using the bathroom properly.  They go through their mundane broadcasting lives doing nothing special.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  And we bring something special to this place.  Oh, very special.  And they end up hating on us.  I heard this story from a co-worker.  Yeah.  She walks into the women's restroom.  Like she was walking onto a yacht.  Yes.  And she walks in, and Lady Di is in the stall, sitting down, pants and underwear at her ankles, 
[00:36:30]  shitting, the door of the stall wide open, and Lady Di's head is pointed down towards the floor  as she's muttering, I just got to get it out.  I just got to get it out.  Then, she stands up in the stall, leaving the door open, and just decides to vomit all over the stall. 
[00:37:00]  No, wait, what do you mean?  Like, after shitting?  Oh, she puked in the stall?  Yes.  Not in the toilet?  In the stall.  Towards the toilet, but in the stall.  Oh, gosh.  So, that would have been all right if everything went down the drains and such, or the pipes,  but the problem was the sink still had pee in me.  Yeah, the sink.  And the problem is...  Oh, what a mess.  We have... 
[00:37:30]  Ladies don't want to deal with puke.  Oh, man.  No, especially if we're on the floor, or shit on the top of the toilet seat.  She's one of those shitters where you don't understand how the poo got everywhere.  Right, exactly.  Because that happens in our bathroom every once in a while.  Like, it's on the floor and stuff.  I'm like, what the hell?  What happens?  There was no mystery for anybody, because the door was wide open.  Were they annoyed at her?  There was a television personality using the bathroom.  Ugly Betty.  Yes.  Ugly Betty.  Ugly Betty was here. 
[00:38:00]  How appropriate.  Yeah, yeah.  And she walks out of the bathroom and says, there's a crazy woman in there who's naked.  Ugly Betty said that?  Yes.  Ugly Betty has to deal with our crap.  With concern in her voice.  Like, who's the naked crazy woman in the bathroom?  Right.  I gotta see the eye today.  Oh, she's here.  Don't worry.  She's on one of her walks right now.  Oh, she is.  Well, that's part three.  Right, we didn't yet talk about the walks. 
[00:38:30]  So, there are multiple complaints.  Not to say, oh, those damn O&A guys are up to it again.  Right.  But just people going, why the fuck is there puke all over the bathroom?  But who are they complaining to?  Facilities, I guess.  The people who are...  Maintenance.  I would just go upstairs.  There's more bathrooms upstairs.  Yeah, but you guys have complained.  I'd be like, oh, what the fuck?  And then I would go upstairs and do what I have to do.  You guys have come on the air and complained viciously when there's shit all over the bathrooms.  Because it was happening over the course of, like, a year. 
[00:39:00]  It was a pattern of, like, how does this happen and who on the overnight is doing it.  If you went into the bathroom and you didn't realize that a show was doing something and you just saw vomit and shit and a crazy naked woman in there, you wouldn't be like, what the fuck is going on?  I feel like I was on the air.  Yeah, no, I know what you mean.  So, and then the cleaning lady is going, why do I have to go in four times over the course of a morning, if she's on call, like a fucking cop, to do a biohazard cleaning. 
[00:39:30]  Tell her, because it's her job.  That's not her job.  That is her job, to make sure the bathrooms are clean.  She went above and beyond yesterday.  So she had a rough day at the office.  What are you going to do?  It happens.  I bet she did.  Yeah.  I apologize to that woman profusely.  She's nice and all, but.  Yes, she did.  Well, I apologize because someone's sick.  Right.  We haven't, look, here's the reality.  I understand why people were annoyed, but why, we had a person who's a fucking chronic alcoholic.  It's a radio, like, area.  There's all radio stations here. 
[00:40:00]  One of the people we're interviewing is a fucking disaster.  Right.  Sorry.  We're interviewing, because what I also found out.  Well, if they kept us in our old facility, no one would have ever known there.  We had our own bathrooms and everything.  What I also found out.  We were self-contained.  We didn't have to socialize with no fuddy-duddies.  She had made a mess on Monday, too, which none of us were aware of.  We weren't aware.  So it wasn't just like we were, it was like we were interviewing a chronic alcoholic over the course of two full days.  Well, that's what we were doing.  Oh, that's what we're doing. 
[00:40:30]  Absolutely.  And guess what?  The people are talking.  Yeah, they are.  When you turn these mics on every day, you want the people to be talking about what they heard.  Heather B., you know, nice Heather B. from Suede Show, just said she had noticed how terrible the women's bathroom smelled.  Oh, God.  And how dirty it was.  But she didn't say anything because she was afraid that it was somebody's mom.  Oh, Heather B.  Nice.  Yeah.  But the bathroom stunk.  Yeah, yeah.  To high heaven.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  It's really like fucking Ratso Rizzo is walking around this fucking building. 
[00:41:00]  Fatso Rizzo.  Fatso Rizzo.  And I mean, there were, yeah, it was just, yeah.  Oh, Lady Di.  So then, um.  It was, it was, it was something, it was the worst the bathroom's ever been.  I mean, nobody.  I hope Colin is suffering, by the way, right now of some sort of fuck.  This is all his idea.  It's all his fault.  Yeah.  And so then people are coming to me.  We got a male, Lady Di's underwear, to Colin Quinn.  That's a great idea.  We have to.  Make sure she really soils him today.  People are then coming to me and saying, who, because they all think she's on drugs or something. 
[00:41:30]  They think we've, or they think she's drunk.  Uh-huh.  And they're saying, who are you putting in?  Why do you keep sending this person in the bathroom?  And I have to explain to these people, no, this is a sick woman.  Yeah.  She's interning for us for the weekend.  Are people happy with her here?  Oh, they hate us.  No, and I had to, after yesterday, I had to make a commitment.  They just end up hating us.  It's the best.  I guarantee you, at least two people have had this talk.  Who brought in that woman and vomited?  And then one other person went, who do you think? 
[00:42:00]  I had to go to co-workers, to security, to the cleaning lady, to facilities, and guarantee  them that I would not allow that person to ever step foot.  Because what I did was, here's what I did yesterday.  Jesus.  Last, when I, I had to throw Lady Di out of the building yesterday.  Oh, man.  Because she's walking into the bathroom, and as she's walking in, I said, Di, what are  you about to do in there?  Oh.  And she said, I'm just going to use the bathroom.  And I said, Di, is it number one or number two? 
[00:42:30]  Right.  And she goes, it's a number two.  And I said, Di, are you going to stay in the stall and remember that it's a shared space?  And she said, yes, yes.  And I said, Di, look at me.  Oh, boy.  Are you going to remember that it's a shared space?  And Tim's assistant was there, and she goes, Sam, you can't talk to her like that.  And I go, no.  This is exactly how you have to talk to her.  Because you know what she did?  She went into that bathroom.  And she made a fucking mess again.  So I said, that's it. 
[00:43:00]  You're banned from the bathroom.  You know how much Bill must hate her fucking wrecking his bathroom?  She's got to destroy it.  So Don Wicklin calls me yesterday afternoon.  He goes, we got to shut her.  We got to shut it down.  We got to stop the Lady Di thing.  I'm like, what?  What are you talking about?  Then he explained the whole bathroom situation, how bad it really was.  It was horrible.  And I said, I got to tell you, Don.  The Di situation's going to come to a head.  I said, I feel like I'm taking a phone call from the radio wizard. 
[00:43:30]  That's exactly what he would do.  I said, he would be shutting this down.  But you're back with this show to not shut things down and to figure out how we can go forward.  Exactly.  So I want you to hang up the phone right now and figure this out and call me back and tell me that you have figured it out.  Make it work.  Make it work.  I might have pumped it up a little bit for the show.  But yeah, pretty much.  Pretty much.  Pretty much.  And, you know, to his credit, he called back.  He goes, OK, I figured it out. 
[00:44:00]  I'm like, OK, what's the deal?  We got to watch her very closely.  I said, OK, we'll do that.  And she cannot use the bathrooms whatsoever.  No.  Yeah.  While she's here.  I get that.  So what is going on and has been happening all morning already, she's being escorted down to the streets of New York City to go to other bathrooms.  And how many times has she gone already?  She number here's what's at number.  She's quarantined beyond the bathroom.  She can only be if she's not in this studio. 
[00:44:30]  Right.  She's quarantined with people watching her in our office with the door shut.  Right.  Number two, every 30 minutes or so, she's being taken out on walks.  And if she has to make, that's when she makes, when she's out on a walk somewhere else.  So she already this morning has been in Starbucks twice shitting up a storm.  Shitting at Starbucks.  Does she have the runs?  She's downing Pepto-Bismols.  Right.  That's the runs.  Yeah. 
[00:45:00]  Because she can't, she's not eating.  What a mess.  She needs to be in, like you said, a hospital.  Yes.  She needs to go, because you know what Dr. C said a withdrawal will kill you?  Right.  With alcohol or Valium.  Like, she needs to be fucking in a rehab.  Of course she does.  In a detox.  We didn't see this coming.  We thought it would be a little fun, but.  She's worse than I thought she was.  She is.  Way worse.  Now we have some weird responsibility here.  Again, this happens.  But who wasn't laughing about her story about taking the fuck to me in a car in the 80s?  Every weekend. 
[00:45:30]  Every weekend, Lady Di would shudder in horror as that boyfriend's car pulled up on Friday.  As she just was stressing out as the week went on.  Probably outside her parents' home.  Right.  Here he comes pulling up.  Getting all gussied up so she can take it in the ass one more time.  Pulling up in an old Datsun B210 as she fucking just clenches her ass thinking, oh, it's Friday  night already.  Can we hear the clip where she, just out of nowhere, said this, please? 
[00:46:00]  Travis, thanks.  I have something I have to tell you.  Okay, watch it.  Okay, back in the 80s.  Yeah.  A long time ago.  Uh-huh.  Every weekend, my boyfriend gave it to me in the ass in a car.  In a car.  Gave it.  And I did not like that, but...  I'm sure he said that too.  What the fuck?  I forgot to mention that.  We weren't talking about...  What the fuck?  I forgot to mention it. 
[00:46:30]  Wait, hold on.  Every weekend, he'd fuck you in the ass in your car.  Yeah.  His car?  Yeah, his car.  What kind of car?  I didn't have a car back in the 80s.  What kind of car?  I had a car, but I didn't use it.  I was with him.  Not fucking in the ass.  Yeah.  Every weekend, you had to deal with that?  Just every weekend.  Holy shit.  Every weekend, you knew it was coming.  Did you finally tell him to stop?  Um, oh boy, that was back in the 80s.  Did you ever get anything out of penis?  Well, let's put it first.  I was...  Back in the 80s, little 80s new wave music playing on the radio. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, God.  What do you think was playing?  I'm on a Mexican radio.  She's getting real in this shit.  I think he liked the tightness of it.  Oh, really?  Really?  Do you think guys like tight, warm things around their dick?  Wow.  You're breaking some new ground here.  Right.  Yeah?  You know, yeah.  Oh, here it is.  The car pulls up.  Now, where did the car park?  Where were you parked?  Wait a minute. 
[00:47:30]  Hold on a second.  Uh-huh.  Just one second.  So, you got in his car.  Yeah.  Where do you drive to?  How much was the fears?  He drove to, like, a park and stuff like that, you know, where there was nobody around.  Wait, at the point it is.  Yeah.  So, he'd take you to the park.  Ron Johnson, stereo salesman.  Yeah, he used to take me to parks and stuff.  So, you go to the park.  Yeah.  Now, you'd park somewhere.  And then he would...  And where would you go?  The back seat?  Yeah.  You'd hit into the back seat?  No, no, no.  The front seat.  The front seat.  Wait, wait.  Front seat?  Yeah, the front seat.  Was it a bench seat on the front or two buckets?  No, it was a bench seat.  Bench seat, like an old school car. 
[00:48:00]  Right, right, right.  All right, so then he would turn you over on your stomach?  Is that how it would go?  Yeah.  On the bench seat?  Would he make you suck it first to get it wet?  Yeah, how did he lube?  Yeah, yeah, I think so.  Yeah?  Would he lick your butt?  No, no, he didn't do that.  No one licked ass back in the 80s.  So, wait a minute now.  Did he...  Was there ever an accident on his penis?  No, no, no, no, no, nothing like that.  He never gave his helmet like a little Abe Lincoln hat?  No.  There you go.  From yesterday, so... 
[00:48:30]  That made me laugh all day long yesterday.  Marion was really disappointed that she had told that story on the air.  Did she tell you?  Yeah.  Do we have the phone call from the pre-show, too?  Oh.  Why didn't Marion shut up?  Before we get Lady Di in here for the first time today, we're waiting for her to get back  from Starbucks.  From her walk.  From her walk, let's call it, yes.  The walk Lady Di.  Ugh.  The stiff-legged walk.  Who has to escort her out of the building so she can hit another bathroom somewhere else?  Sal and our intern, Adrian. 
[00:49:00]  Wow.  Who had to pick her up also the first day.  Right, right.  Adrian's a good boy.  Yeah.  She was in the office this morning for literally two minutes before she got up and said,  I have to go.  Oh, my God.  I should also, when...  Jeez, Jimmy.  When we're ready, I should tell you, because she knew how mad I was at her yesterday.  Right.  So she came in and bragged about taking personal responsibility, and I would like to tell you  what she bragged about, how she handles herself this morning.  Okay.  You want to know now?  Yes. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Well, she told me, number one, I went back to see her, and she said, Sam, you see that  TGI Friday's bag over there?  She said, yeah, and she said, there's two pairs of clean panties in there.  Oh.  All right.  So she's taking some responsibility.  And I said, oh, okay.  Because the panties yesterday were a disaster.  And then she said this, and I have an adult diaper on, just in case.  She's wearing...  Is she wearing an adult diaper?  A diety today?  She says, I have an adult diaper on. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, my God.  Just in case Lady Di becomes Lady Diarrhea.  She said that.  That's a good one.  How did we miss that yesterday?  She literally...  She's like the fucking little girl in the exorcist when she's possessed.  Yes.  Like, in the book, they talk about putting a fucking, like, rubber underpants on her  so she can diuretically evacuate into them.  Trav, do you have anything to add?  Because you were telling me that she had some great updates.  Was that where you were referring to?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, basically.  And man, tell me what you just told me.  Oh, our intern, Adrian, does believe that that adult diaper has been soiled.  Oh, no.  Oh, this is going to be a classic week.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Is that what the Marion call?  Yeah, so Marion called the pre-show.  Oh, no.  Yeah, so the update, we gave her $140 yesterday, which has nothing to do with her salary this week.  And then, as I'm leaving, she's trying to hit me up for more money, saying, I really need it.  I need it back.  For what?  She spent half of it at the fucking TGIF?  And I'm like, you got a nice $140. 
[00:51:00]  That's good for today.  And don't worry.  You know, we'll...  Might be other extras during the week.  Of course.  But that's pretty good for one day.  Yeah.  And then it turns out she spent most of the money at TGIF right after the show, drinking mostly,  I would assume, we'll get the update from her in a few minutes.  And then Marion called her best friend to give her the business a little bit.  Oh, boy.  Marion, Lady Di's best friend.  You there?  Yeah.  Hi, Sam.  How are you?  Hey, how are you?  Marion, what is...  Oh, I'm good.  But listen to me. 
[00:51:30]  You got to get that lady help.  You got to get Diane help.  Did you...  We are best friends.  But I'm going to tell you, you know, we don't really hang together no more because of that.  Yeah.  Look at her.  She gets bloated and bloated and bloated more.  And I swear, she's got to have liver disease.  She needs more.  Marion, Marion, I got to tell you something.  Did you hear the show yesterday?  I heard most of it, but I'm working.  So I have to go in and out and get in my car because, you know, I don't have my flight no more.  So I got to go in my car and listen to what I do now and then.  Marion, she's in here. 
[00:52:00]  She's making a complete mess of the bathroom.  She's not eating.  She was at TGI Friday for like four hours the other day.  She called me up the other day half loaded.  Why are you...  Is there anything you can do to get her help?  No, because she won't listen to me.  Oh, my God.  What are we going to...  I don't think any of us had any idea how bad her health was.  She called me yesterday.  She got a place because you guys gave her...  What Opie gave her.  I don't want to say it, but I know what Opie gave her. 
[00:52:30]  She ended up spending, I guess, just about half of it at TGI Friday's again yesterday.  $10 a freaking drink there.  Okay.  She's saying, you know, go to her home.  Lady Di was paid $140 yesterday to take off her panties to show us the skid marks.  I heard the replay of that.  But let me tell you something.  Yeah.  She spent most of it, had to be, maybe all of it.  I don't know what she's got left at TGI Friday's because she called me, asked me if I heard  the show.  She called me when she was supposed to be going home.  And she said, TGI Friday's laughing and giggling. 
[00:53:00]  I mean, it's nice that you guys are doing this far.  And I think it's great.  But you guys, she's got, look at her.  She's got to get her life.  She's two years older than me.  All right, Marion, I want you to hear, I want you to hear a story that she told on the air  yesterday.  What are the calls?  Wow.  There's Marion.  Wow.  So let's get Lady Di.  Marion's concerned.  Can we get Lady Di in here?  Oh, please.  I miss her terribly.  We have to escort her up the hall, though.  I'll be right back.  Really?  Please bring her in here.  We have to.  She has to be escorted everywhere. 
[00:53:30]  Do you miss her terribly already?  I do.  Oh, I want to see what lovely garment she's wearing today.  By the way, I would assume they're going to try to say this is it.  Today is it.  Probably.  So we've got to keep fighting the good fight.  Oh, we've got to fight.  Well, maybe she's on a good behavior today.  Maybe there'll be a problem.  This is too good.  If she's good, they might go, you know what?  She was fine yesterday.  Okay, she had a couple bad days.  She vomited all over the bathroom and shit all over the floor.  But she's okay today.  Let's see.  I'd love to see what she's wearing.  She's got a Not Sam shirt on that fucking yoga ball body. 
[00:54:00]  She's walking down the hall.  Jeez.  There she is.  For the first time on her third day of her internship.  She's always grabbing her crotch.  The diapers are probably rubbing against it.  It's probably itchy.  Rubbing.  I don't want that purse near me, by the way, because I don't trust bed bugs.  No.  I don't want that purse next to me.  No.  Put it on the purse over there.  She keeps grabbing her crotch.  She's grabbing her crotch.  Lady Di is entering the studio.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Lady Di. 
[00:54:30]  Lady Di.  Day three.  Hello, dear.  Get on a microphone.  Put it on that side there.  That's a giant Not Sam shirt.  That is the biggest fucking size they make.  You got to sit on that.  3XL.  And do you have the skull and crossbones on the back?  No.  With the back.  What happened?  Did she put a patch over her?  No.  She asked.  Sam cut it off for me.  You cut it off.  What do you mean?  It's just a hole in the back.  Wait.  Let me see the back of your shirt.  Turn around. 
[00:55:00]  There's a big hole.  It looks like a ripped out hole in the back of your shirt.  You didn't want the skull and crossbones, so now there's a huge hole in the back of your shirt.  There's a very small faded skull and crossbones on the back because that's the designer's logo.  Now, Di, what is in the O on the Not Sam shirt?  Oh, that's a toothpaste.  Toothpaste.  Yes, combing her hair.  You're combing your hair.  Hi, girl.  Did you get a shower yesterday or this morning? 
[00:55:30]  Actually, late last night.  Yeah, your hair looks slightly better.  A little less greasy.  A little bouncing luster to it, which is nice.  Slightly better.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I mean, you know, I did that because I had to.  All right, so there's a lot going on here, Lady Di.  Let's start.  What are you doing?  Sit down, dude.  What are you doing?  I'm putting my comb back.  Okay, we're going to interview you.  So you're our intern.  Yeah.  So a lot of people are upset because you destroyed the bathroom yesterday.  Yeah.  You want to comment about that?  Supposedly, you were shitting in a stall with the door open and all the shit wasn't getting 
[00:56:00]  into the toilet.  I think it threw up.  Oh, no, that's not true.  I'm just telling you what they said.  What was she muttering, Sam, allegedly?  I got to get this out.  I got to get it out.  You were saying, I got to get it out with the stall door open while you're making a duty.  Yeah.  Well, the reason that the stall was a little bit open is because of this way I could, you  know, the seats are so low.  Yeah.  And I have a hard time getting up from low things.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Right?  Because of my weight.  Right.  So what I do is I hold on to the stall and I get myself up. 
[00:56:30]  So you left the door open basically as a way to help yourself up.  Why not use the handicap stall?  You know what?  I didn't even think about that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, Lady Di, let me get this straight now.  Yeah.  You don't sit on the bowl?  Yes, I do.  You squat over it?  Oh, come on.  I'm just saying.  Of course I sit on the bowl.  That's how we made it the sound.  Well, did you...  It's not like you hang like a monkey from the fucking, uh...  Did you notice people were in the bathroom when you were there?  And you didn't care?  Um...  You didn't care that the door was open? 
[00:57:00]  She has no concept of shared space.  No, huh?  Let me ask you a question.  And you got physically, you vomited a couple of times.  In the sink?  Yeah.  Why in the sink?  Because I don't like to vomit in the toilet.  Why?  Because there's only two things that go in the toilet.  Uh-huh.  Right.  Number one and number two.  No, and vomit.  And vomit.  How is it...  How is it...  We've all puked in a toilet.  Of course.  You think it's cleanly...  Like a little time ago.  You think it's more clean to vomit all over a sink and stop? 
[00:57:30]  It up with vomit.  You think that's like clean because it's not a toilet.  All right.  Well, I apologize.  I'm not going to do that anymore.  No, but I do...  What do you do at home?  Huh?  Because this is not...  This is something that obviously happens...  I watch TV.  Holy shit.  Can I just enjoy the greatest answer ever?  I watch TV.  I mean, when you...  You're obviously shitting and vomiting at home.  So poor Bill's bathroom must...  You probably puke in the sink every day at home.  No.  How often?  How often?  It happens, though.  How often?  It does happen.  But no, not every day. 
[00:58:00]  Always in the sink?  Yeah.  How many bathrooms do you have?  One bathroom.  Oh, my God.  And your toothbrush...  His toothbrush and stuff is in there?  Oh, boy.  Do you rinse out the sink?  He doesn't brush his teeth.  What the...  What do you mean?  Bill doesn't brush his teeth.  What do you mean?  No, he wears dentures.  So he doesn't brush...  I'm the one that brushes my teeth.  Wait, Bill doesn't brush the teeth at all?  Oh, he puts polydent in the dentures.  But what about your gums?  Yeah, but you still got to kind of brush, no?  Don't you got to brush your gums?  I don't know.  He might. 
[00:58:30]  I have no idea, but...  So what about the puke in the sink?  What a house of horrors.  Do you make sure it goes down the drain?  Well, I really don't puke that much at home, okay?  Why were you puking yesterday?  Were you going through withdrawals?  Yeah.  No.  I don't know.  Well, I think it's withdrawals.  It might be, but...  Have you puked today?  No.  Did you have natty ices before the show today?  No.  No.  No.  Did you?  No, I did not.  Maybe one?  No, I did not.  Really, I didn't.  Did you notice people were bothered by your bathroom habits yesterday?  Well, I apologize to everybody. 
[00:59:00]  No, I'm asking...  But did you notice?  One person told me to shut the bathroom stall.  That might have been Ugly Betty.  Ugly Betty.  It was Ugly Betty.  Remember the show Ugly Betty?  Yeah, I do remember that show.  That was her.  She was in there yesterday when you were in there.  She was showing concern.  So basically, you were...  She asked who the crazy naked woman was in the bathroom.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Why were you naked in the bathroom?  Did she get naked?  Well, that was also when she was showing us her panties. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, right.  Yeah.  So I guess she walked around a little bit, completely bottomless, in the bathroom.  Were you doing that?  Is that a possibility?  No.  I did not change in the stall.  Okay.  I changed...  I changed by the sink.  Why would you do that in a shared space?  I don't know.  Why would you go in the stall with some privacy?  What?  Why would you do that? 
[01:00:00]  I'm really putting my foot into this this time.  No.  Yeah.  But why would you do that, guy?  But why would you do that?  Why?  I don't know.  Because there's more room by the sink than there is in the stall.  But there's people around.  You're not supposed to do that in a public space.  You don't care about the people being around?  Like, how does it work?  All right.  All right.  Listen.  Listen.  Okay.  If I ever have to take off my underwear again, I'm going to do it in the stall.  These are lessons we learn at four years of a ride.  Yeah.  United 55 or whatever it is.  Right.  Jesus.  Wow.  All right.  So after the show, you went to TGIF with 140 bucks, according to Marion? 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, but I didn't spend it all.  How much did you?  I bought something to eat, too, you know.  What did you eat?  All right.  I had chicken fingers.  Oh, good for you.  All right.  Chicken fingers.  That's a start.  And how many beers?  Oh, maybe about four or five.  Four or five $10 beers.  So you spent half the money easily.  Is that half the money?  Chicken fingers and fingers.  I guess so.  I guess it is.  I don't know.  How much you got left out of the 140?  Oh, I don't know. 
[01:01:00]  Around $10, I think.  Where did the rest go?  I had to run a couple of errands yesterday.  Like what?  What errands?  I had to go get a 30-pack.  All right.  I had to go get a 30-pack.  A 30-pack?  I had to go get beer for Bill.  Right.  But you bought it?  I bought it this time.  Oh, boy.  A 30-pack.  Thank you, Opie.  30?  No.  Anthony gave more money than me yesterday.  Oh, Anthony did thank you.  Anthony gave the Hyundai.  I gave money.  I gave a lousy 20 yesterday.  Anthony looks good today, though, right? 
[01:01:30]  He always looks good.  He does.  He does.  He always looks good.  He does.  Thank you.  And I'll be honest.  He liked the fact that you brought your panties in.  There was something sexy about that because it was naughty.  You want to see him?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She brought him in.  Wait.  She's got new panties in a bag.  Fresh panties in a baggie.  Just in case of a...  Absolutely.  So you're prepared today.  New panties in a bag.  How many Natty Ices did you have after you got home?  Were you drinking all night?  No.  Did you kill the 30-pack, though?  I'm going to say, hold on.  You killed the 30-pack, though, right?  Look at those bloomers. 
[01:02:00]  She's got brand new panties.  She's got bloomers.  Oh, they're a bit sexy, too.  A little pink on them.  They're all ripped.  The fucking elastics ripped.  Why are they ripped?  I thought they were brand new.  That's not sexy at all.  No, they're clean.  Oh.  They're clean.  The elastic band is ripped like halfway around.  Those are sexy panties, Lady Di.  Thank you very much.  Hold them up again, sweetie.  They're actually really hot.  Opposite of sexy.  Wait.  Hold on.  There you go.  Those are like bloomers.  Jim Norton will be tweeting the panties any second now. 
[01:02:30]  You guys tweet everything.  Don't you?  No.  No.  Nothing that would embarrass you.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  So you got the 30-pack.  What other errands did you have to do after the show?  Did Lady Di?  There's a hole in the ass of those panties.  I know.  And the inside is...  So what?  It matches the shirt.  Those must be from the 80s, those panties.  The inside is not clean.  Jim, look at the inside.  And you tell me if they're clean.  Let me see.  Hold on, Doug.  Look at the inside.  It's all right.  Easy access, right?  Lady Di.  Let's turn them inside out.  Turn them inside out, love.  Because they're clean.  Hold on.  Those aren't bad. 
[01:03:00]  Hold them up there, sweetie.  Hold on.  Oh, boy.  Hold them up like that.  There you go.  Perfect.  Hold it up.  They're old.  That's what it is.  What is that hole right there in the back?  It's all right.  They're old.  Oh, do you use those in the 80s?  Yeah, those are the 80s.  I said that already.  Oh, you did?  Yes.  No, it was early.  Actually, it was...  Actually, I got these two years ago.  Yeah.  Well, this morning I had to access...  A lot of stress and strain.  Maybe today we get her a few panties instead of giving her cash.  Underwear?  Long. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, we're calling them panties, but they're massive bloomers.  They are bloomers.  They go up high on the sides, though.  Yeah.  It's a little sexiness to them.  They're underpants.  So what other errands did you do, Lady Di?  You got the 30-pack for Bill.  Had a few beers with him.  What else?  He wanted two packs of cigarettes, and I got one pack.  Why only one?  Oh, one for yourself.  Okay.  How many?  Because I already had the backup packs.  Sure.  Right.  How much in the 30-pack is gone, though?  Mustang cigarettes, right?  No, not that much.  I went to bed kind of early last night. 
[01:04:00]  So did you get, like...  Is there 10 left?  Maybe not quite that many?  There's more than 10.  You look a little healthier today.  I guess the beer does wonders.  Let me tell you something right now.  Yeah.  Here's the excuse.  I told Bobo about...  No, no, no, no.  There's no excuse.  Dr. Bobo?  I told Bobo about this, too.  Okay, well...  Oh, boy.  I have, like, maybe about four pairs of panties hanging on my shower.  Uh-huh.  Because every time I, you know, have an accident... 
[01:04:30]  I don't want the panties drying on the rod.  Yeah.  Right.  Well, no.  Every time I have an accident, you've got to rinse them out.  Use soap and rinse them out and just put them...  Hang them on the shower.  How many accidents do you have?  Huh?  Why would you tell Bobo that?  It's so weird.  How many accidents do you have?  That's a great question.  No, no, no.  The only thing I told Bobo was, I'm tired of hanging up the...  I'm tired of cleaning panties and hanging them up.  I'm sorry.  How often do you have accidents?  That's a good question.  How often?  Tell the truth.  Do you have accidents?  How often do you have accidents? 
[01:05:00]  Sam is right.  How often?  How often?  Well, I had two yesterday.  Two accidents.  So you're kind of kidding your pants?  Basically, yeah.  What's happening to you?  I don't know what's happening to me.  I mean, maybe it's some kind of virus or something.  I don't know.  Oh, Lady Di, it's your alcoholism.  If it is my alcoholism...  Let's be honest with each other here.  If it is my alcoholism, it might be my alcoholism, but it was never like this before.  Are you going to try to do something about it?  Yeah, I'm taking Pepto-Bismol right now. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, perfect.  Well, that'll cure alcoholism.  I'll let Don Wicklin know we're totally fine.  You're doing a lot of Pepto today?  Yeah, I'm going to have to.  Yeah.  What else did you do last night?  Watch TV.  Just relaxed after a long day of interning.  Matter of fact, I was watching TV.  My eyes started to close, and I'm like, okay, it's time for me to lay down.  That was it.  Are you standing?  What show were you watching?  Oh, my God.  Oh, what show was I watching when I got home?  The tough questions. 
[01:06:00]  Don't even remember.  Oh, my roommate had CSI on, because he likes that show.  Oh, yeah.  He's hoping to see you on it.  And I started to, my eyes started to, you know, I started to get sleepy and stuff.  I said, let me lay down.  I don't even like this show.  Right.  He's the one that likes these shows.  Oh, boy.  So he puts these shows on when I'm not around.  I don't understand the dynamic between you and Bill.  Are you guys friends?  He just is a good soul giving you a place to live?  What's up?  He's a good soul.  He's giving me a place to live. 
[01:06:30]  We're friends.  But, you know, we do yell at each other once in a while.  You're going to expect that one.  A little domestic.  When you live with somebody else.  A little domestic dispute?  The cops ever been called?  No.  What?  How many times?  Oh, boy.  That means yes.  Be honest.  That means yes.  That sounds like the cops have been called.  He used to live in another place.  I did call the cops on him a couple of times.  Why?  Why?  Because I was working, okay?  Uh-huh.  All right?  And he would hold my money, and I didn't like that because I wanted my own money. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, man.  Why would he hold your money?  He would hide it on me.  Probably so you wouldn't spend it all.  Yeah.  It seems like he was trying to do the right thing.  And you'd call the cops.  He was trying to do the right thing, but I wanted to spend my own money.  You know?  I mean, does that make any sense?  Of course it does.  So he would hide it on me, and I'd call the cops.  You know, I told the cops, he has my money, and I want it.  That's it.  Because back then, you know, I was working for a temporary agency, right? 
[01:07:30]  And I think I was making, like, in a week, about $200 and...  I'm guessing now, $275.  Righteous bucks.  And he held my money on me.  Uh-huh.  So you had to call the police.  And I said, you shouldn't...  Yeah.  Like, I called the cops on him...  I hate to say this.  I called the cops on him maybe about, you know, twice with that incident.  What else did you call the cops on him?  The tax return.  He tried to hold that on me.  Okay?  And I called the cops on him.  But he... 
[01:08:00]  Bill says he's got his own money.  Supposedly he's all right with money.  No, he is all right with money.  Yeah.  Okay, but he was holding my money.  No, I understand.  Yeah, I get it.  You know what I mean?  Right.  And I didn't, you know...  But my point is, he wasn't holding your money because he wanted your money.  He was holding your money because he knew you were spending it too quickly.  Irresponsibly.  Or irresponsibly, right.  Yeah, well, you know, my parents were the same way.  Yeah.  They would hold my money.  So for your whole life, people have basically been telling you that you're irresponsible. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Basically.  Why are you still pulling your hair like that?  You're pulling your hair.  No, I'm twirling my hair.  Are you flirting with Anthony a little bit?  You're pulling on him.  She's being sexy for Anthony.  She puts her panties back in her plastic pants.  That's nice.  You see Anthony looking at the panties?  Huh?  You see Anthony looking at the panties?  I did look at the panties.  Yes, you did.  She has two pairs of sexy...  You want to look at them?  Go ahead, show them.  No.  No, go ahead.  Don't you fucking dare.  I'll give you ten bucks if you throw a pair of them.  I will throw water on everyone in this room and then leave. 
[01:09:00]  I will fucking leave and go home.  Just because she wants to show the panties?  If she throws or comes near me or something.  Oh.  No.  Not even as a bitch.  I'll show you.  All right, hold on.  Don't even do it as a bitch.  I'll show you.  I already showed you anyway.  No, I saw the fucking panties.  I don't want to see him again.  He's flirting.  Why are you upset?  Okay.  Why are you upset?  He's flirting.  Exactly.  Why is Anthony upset?  That tent in your pants is telling a different story.  I don't...  I don't need this. 
[01:09:30]  Jesse in Kansas has something for Lady Di.  Jesse.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  Hey, there's a show on National Geographic that's about...  It's called Drugged, and it shows what severe alcoholism is.  It's just like marking off the checkboxes.  You go down a list, she's got everything.  Throwing up in the sink, guy.  You got the green apple splatters every day.  Maybe we should look that up.  You got to look it up, because this is the path she's heading on. 
[01:10:00]  That guy was the epitome of an alcoholic.  I mean, guy, you got to recognize you are...  You're going to kill yourself doing this.  Yeah, you...  Yeah, but you know...  I don't...  You know, I don't know what to say.  You ever try stopping or going to detox?  Yeah.  What happened?  A few times.  What happens?  Yeah.  Well...  You don't learn?  I went to three rehabs, and I think about maybe two detoxes.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  The detox, you couldn't even smoke in them. 
[01:10:30]  Okay.  You know what I mean?  No, really?  Seriously.  Because they're detoxifying you.  Yeah, but that...  That's what detox means.  You're going to have to do some tough things to get yourself back together.  Five days into the detox, I was let go, and then they gave me back my cigarettes.  Yeah, the new...  Not smoking shit in rehabs, it's like when someone's quitting drinking or drugging, I don't  think you should be worried about the fucking cigarettes at the moment.  Yeah, let them figure that out down the road.  Yeah, that's a hard one.  Let them do that down the road.  I did that years in the society. 
[01:11:00]  Let them go outside and have a cigarette.  Yes.  So you can take care of the other things.  Yeah, well, the one rehab I was in, they let you do that.  And how long did you last there?  30 days.  How long do you last in rehab?  How long did you take sober?  But you know what?  This rehab...  Well, the answer is five, because you just told me you last...  That's detox.  Oh, you said detox.  I'm sorry.  So you made it through all 30 days in rehab.  I made it through all 30 days.  Well, you know, actually, I didn't have a choice.  I was already in Marlboro Township, so it's like, if I got out of the rehab, where was  I going to go?  True.  So, you know, come on.  How long, and I want an honest answer, how long did you stay sober after rehab? 
[01:11:30]  Two days.  Wow.  What happened?  Two days.  I'm right back to the beer again.  But that's what happens.  Most people go right back to it.  There's not a lot of success stories.  Jimmy will tell you.  The one rehab that I went to, which was the first one, the same day that they let me  out, I started drinking again.  You love beer, don't you?  I do love beer.  Wow.  Is it just beer, or do you drink hard stuff?  No, I used to drink hard stuff. 
[01:12:00]  I quit that.  You don't slip a little jack into a Coke sometimes?  No.  Maybe a little.  Maybe a little.  Be honest.  No, I don't.  Really.  Seriously.  I believe it.  Wow.  You drank right away, so you weren't paying attention at all?  What do you mean?  In rehab?  Yeah.  I paid attention to everything.  I know what drinking does to your body.  I already know.  You're talking to a woman who decided it was logical to change her underpants by the sink  instead of in the snow.  Oh, yeah.  How old is your son?  My son is 23 years old, and he doesn't do any of that.  Don't you think he's embarrassed by you, though? 
[01:12:30]  Oh, boy.  Honestly.  Like, you're doing to yourself.  He is embarrassed.  Oh, boy.  No, he isn't.  You know, but he is embarrassed.  Oh, boy.  How do you know you're not going to go to the bathroom in your pants today?  I don't know.  Right now, I don't have to go.  What kind of panties do you have on?  I have adult diapers on, just in case.  There we go.  Just in case.  That's smart.  That's responsible.  And I'm kind of glad that I have the adult diapers on.  Uh-oh.  Why is that?  Because the bathroom over here is not working. 
[01:13:00]  I have to go all the way to Starbucks to go to the bathroom.  Oh, because the bathroom's broken.  The bathroom's broken.  Yeah, the bathroom's broken.  I hope I didn't break it.  No.  Oh, okay.  Wait.  Yeah.  Is that what they told her?  Yeah, I guess.  I don't know why.  Who told you the bathroom's broke?  Bathroom's broken.  Who told you?  One of the...  Who's...  I did not tell you.  Sal?  Well, that's fair enough.  That's good.  Who told you?  Oh, no.  Adrian told me.  Adrian, the intern.  I was trying to think, uh, who told me, you know. 
[01:13:30]  Uh-huh.  Adrian.  So the intern told you.  So the bathroom's broke, so everyone has to go all the way down to Starbucks if they  need to go to the bathroom.  Yeah.  They do?  The bathroom.  Yep.  Or Dunkin' Donuts, I guess, right?  Right.  Right.  What about the one on 37, broken too?  Making some Dunkin' Munchkins in the fucking toilet there, huh?  Not even.  It's a colada.  Fucking cream.  So colada with pulp in it.  What is this idea that somebody banned me from the building?  Huh?  If you were banned from the building, how would you ask us about it in here?  Well, I don't know.  Opie said something.  I heard it in... 
[01:14:00]  They were trying to tell us that you couldn't come in anymore, and we took care of that.  Okay, thank you.  We fixed that shit.  We took care of that.  Thank you so much.  Right away.  Thank you so much.  You know.  But I had one pair of adult diapers left, and I wore them today.  Ah.  One pair.  Only one pair left.  That's it.  That's all I got.  Did you soil them yet?  Not yet.  Well, it's good that you spent your money on a 30-pack of beer and hung your panties up,  you know, in the shower instead of buying a pack of adult diapers.  Oh, yeah.  Mm. 
[01:14:30]  Ten dollars left out of 140 most spent on beer.  Well, you were asking Opie's way out, you were asking Opie for more...  And Bill's beer, too.  ...for more money.  Right.  Huh?  You were asking Opie for more money on his way out yesterday.  Oh, you needed a little more money yesterday.  Yes.  What do you want money for?  She said she needs it badly.  I didn't say I need it badly.  You said I could really use it.  I could really use it, I guess.  Well, I could always really use it, but...  And I said, don't worry about it.  We'll give you more money as the week goes on. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, you did say that, didn't you?  But you're just spending it on beer.  Right.  No, not all the money goes on beer.  No, she said cigarettes.  Not all of it.  Cigarettes, too.  Wait, between the 30-pack and the beers you had at TGIF, most of the money was on beer.  How much is a 30-pack?  I did buy some food.  How much is a 30-pack of 90-eyes?  Um, $18.99.  What are you going to do the math now?  You bought fucking chicken fingers.  Diana, why do you keep...  Why do you keep scratching your crotch?  I'm not scratching, I'm adjusting.  Oh, the diaper.  Yeah.  Adjusting your diaper. 
[01:15:30]  Holy mother...  What?  It's like, why are you scratching your crotch?  Oh, adjusting your diaper.  Just said like...  It was said like, oh, yeah, the wall is fucking painted blue.  Let's just put it this way.  I did not use the credit card.  Okay.  I didn't ask about a credit card.  Who asked about a credit card?  Are you counting how much money you have left?  Out of the $140, so far you've got four bucks left on the table.  I want to see something a minute.  What are you looking for?  The receipt to Bayway Liquors.  Oh, by the way, I've got to give a shout-out.  Oh, you feel free. 
[01:16:00]  Okay.  Monk from Bayway Liquors.  Right.  Okay.  I've been told to mention his name.  Oh, I've got less than...  Well, is he giving you anything for these mentions?  Yeah.  What's he giving you?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Thank you.  What's he giving you for the mentions?  What is he giving you?  What is he giving you for the mentions?  Did he give you a beer?  Did he give you anything?  No.  Why would you mention his name?  Don't mention him.  He's not giving you anything free.  He's not giving you anything.  Fuck him.  No, no, no.  The only thing he did was...  Hold on.  A mention for business on this show is worth thousands of dollars. 
[01:16:30]  Right.  So at the very least, he should have gave you the 30-pack for free.  Right.  At the very least.  So stop mentioning him if they're not taking care of you over there.  Fuck him and his liquor store.  He might be a nice guy and all, but...  I'm not going to mention anybody anymore.  Fuck him like your boyfriend used to fuck you on the weekends.  Right in the ass.  You should be doing the right thing.  He'll give you a few extras or a few freebies.  Why is your ringer on again?  Your phone's ringing.  I know my phone's ringing.  Who is it?  I know who it is.  It's Marion?  Who is it?  Yeah, it's Marion.  Pick it up!  Call the show!  Pick it up!  Pick it up! 
[01:17:00]  Wait.  Pick it up, guys.  What's this right here?  What?  What's that?  Will you pick up Marion?  No.  What's this?  Tell her to call the show.  Pick it up.  But you could put her on speaker.  Is this Coors?  What's some of that other beer?  Lady DiBorg.  Yeah, that's Coors.  Bank with bottles.  That's what Bill wants.  Okay.  She bought a 30-pack of Natty Ice.  All right.  And two 12-packs of Coors.  You bought two 12-packs of Coors?  Which is pretty much almost two 30-packs.  That's the case.  Right.  So, Lady Di, who drinks Coors?  You bought... 
[01:17:30]  You spent all your money on beer.  My roommate does.  You spent all your money on beer.  He was running out, so he started to drink my beer.  So the Natty Ice is yours?  The Natty Ice is mine.  But you said you bought it for him.  No, I bought the Coors for him.  He's never mentioned the Coors.  You are lying to us.  You spent most of your money.  Most of that 140 bucks went to beer.  How much did the hotel come to you?  Most of it did.  Yeah, I hate to say it, but...  Yes.  But, well...  52 dollars.  And then you're asking for more.  A liquor store where the guy wants free plugs.  Right.  And then another 50-some-odd dollars at TGI Fridays, at least. 
[01:18:00]  I said I'll mention your name.  And for what?  He didn't give you anything for free.  He didn't give you anything for free.  It's called Payola.  At least supported for you.  That's right.  It's like another 70 bucks at TGI.  You should be getting an envelope from the guy.  TGI Fridays plus this, that's where all your fucking money went.  Do you have the TGIF receipt?  No.  Will you answer your phone?  If it's Marion, we want to talk to her immediately.  Answer the phone.  All right, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus.  Hurry.  Just answer it.  No matter what.  Well, I've got to get out of my pocketbook first.  Cool.  Okay.  Wait.  Mule.  Is it still ringing? 
[01:18:30]  Yes, it is.  Answer it.  Oh, my God.  No, it's not.  Just answer.  Yeah, because you take 10 minutes to answer it.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Let me see.  He's just looking at the phone.  Wow.  I'm your private number that keeps on calling.  I'm your private number.  Your private number keeps on calling over here.  Oh, yeah?  Are you checking the, uh, uh, who are you calling?  The private number?  Huh?  You're calling Marion?  Oh, you're calling Marion.  Okay.  Put her on speaker.  Can you put her on speaker?  Put her on speaker.  You can put her on speaker right now.  Hello? 
[01:19:00]  Hello?  Yeah, what?  You're on the air.  Tell her she's on the air.  All right, put her...  On the air right now.  Sam, help her put it near the microphone.  What, Diana?  What do you want?  Okay, she says, what?  What do I want?  We hear it.  We hear her.  Could she call the show?  Ask her that.  What?  Call the show.  Call the show.  Can you do it?  For what?  We were concerned.  Call the show.  We were concerned, Marion.  Okay?  No, I don't want to.  Why?  You're trying to help your friend.  There's no reason to, all right?  There's no reason to.  All right.  Wait, hold on, hold on, Diane. 
[01:19:30]  Marion, you called the show this morning to talk to Sam.  Well, now Diana's here, and we're trying to get...  We're trying to figure things out, so we need your help.  No, she just hung up.  Call her back.  I think you hung up by mistake, because your face hit the button.  No.  Call her back.  Call her back.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  Fucking...  And does she have the TGIF receipt in her pocketbook?  Okay.  I left them on the...  Assume that it's about 70 bucks.  If she said five beers, plus food, plus two food. 
[01:20:00]  That TGI Friday is one of the most expensive restaurants in Times Square.  Right.  She fucking spent all that money that we gave her on beer.  On booze, mostly.  On fucking beer, and was asking for more money.  Yes.  Holy shit, Diane.  You got to put on speaker, though.  You got to put on speaker so we can hear it.  And you got to tell her you're on the air, Pigo.  Say that.  Okay.  What do you want, Diane?  I'm very busy.  You're on the radio.  Okay.  You're on the radio again. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Tell her.  Tell her to call in.  She hung up on me.  She hangs up on her.  No, you're hanging up on her because you keep hitting the button.  No, I'm not hanging up on her.  Lady Di.  You're hitting the button.  What's her problem, you think?  I think she's just mad at me.  Why?  Because yesterday I tried to sleep, and I hung up the phone, and I was just trying to take  a nap.  You know what I mean?  Were you hung up on her?  Yeah.  What happened?  She called you out of concern?  No, she did call me out of concern.  And what did you do?  She wanted to find out if I went home, and I said, yeah, I'm home. 
[01:21:00]  I said, I'm going to sleep right now.  You know, I got to go, and then I just hung up.  You didn't say goodbye or talk to her?  No, no.  Why were you so rude?  I don't know.  And you still have the same smudge on your glasses.  She's a nasty drunk.  What are you doing?  No, the receipt's not in there.  You still have the same, Diana, you still have the same smudge on your glasses from three  days ago.  I do.  On those lopsided glasses.  What I do, let me tell you something.  What I do is I just, I put them on the table, and because, you know, when I watch TV, I 
[01:21:30]  don't wear my glasses.  No.  Here, give me your glasses.  What is that?  I'm going to clean your glasses.  It's a glass cleaner.  It's a glass cleaner.  Oh, okay.  Oh, boy.  Your phone's ringing, Diana.  It's probably her.  That's the private number again.  I don't think it's married.  She's busy.  Get over there.  Give Anthony a kiss on the way back.  No.  Stay there.  No one needs to come here.  Stay there.  No one needs to come back here.  No, she's got to get the glasses.  No, she doesn't.  We can pass him back over the fucking console.  I'm not putting up with this.  This is my house.  What? 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, what's she afraid of?  Yeah, what's she afraid of?  She's just a nice lady.  Sit your ample ass back in the fucking chair.  Don't throw them.  Give them something to give.  Just throw them to the intern to give them.  Don't throw your glasses.  I don't like people walking behind me is what it is.  But Sal's walking behind her?  Well, Sal's thin.  Oh.  He's not going to bump into my chair.  Give me the tissues.  Shit.  Why wouldn't you clean these?  They're all...  Why am I touching these?  They're all...  Why am I touching these?  All right, go ahead. 
[01:22:30]  Well, clean them.  No one's saying you should light them in gold.  Yeah, but...  Could you give me some...  No, give me the...  No, sometimes...  Give me the tissues.  Sometimes when I have tears in my eyes, they get on the glasses.  All right, get on the headphones.  Someone wants to say hi to you.  Through your tears.  I see.  The person that is responsible for this, Colin Quinn.  Colin!  Thanks.  Hi, Colin.  Don't let them ask you how you spend...  How do you spend the money you work with me at that place?  It's your business, okay?  Oh, Colin.  You tell them you need more today. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  You know what?  I really did not need to do that.  You know what I mean?  Tell Anthony if he doesn't give you another hundred today, you're going to walk behind his chair.  Let me tell you something else.  You really want me to say that?  I heard it.  I think, yeah.  You better say it.  Say it now.  Who was your fiscal acumen yesterday during the Jackie Robinson, excuse me, Bell Knotts interview?  Jackie Robinson, Don Knotts.  Oh, my God.  She says, Jackie Robinson, Don Knotts. 
[01:23:30]  It's a little different than Don Knotts interview yesterday, yeah.  I don't remember the part where Andy tooled him in the ass.  Actually, do you remember that?  That was a great episode.  Where was I when you were doing this?  Holy shit.  I'm giving her glasses a rape shower.  Thank you very much, Opie.  I really appreciate that.  I should be doing that.  You really should.  Yes, you should.  You should.  You know, I should be doing that.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  Look how much cleaner it is.  But that shit ain't coming out.  They're all scratched up. 
[01:24:00]  She probably took a fucking header all hammered one night, leaving the bar.  Actually, no, no, no.  Actually, I don't know what we could do with that.  Oh, my God.  Those are so scratched up.  No, no, no.  I was going to say when I fell in my apartment, I had my glasses on, but I don't think so.  When I fell in the apartment.  When you fell in the apartment.  Yeah.  It looks like a fucking airplane windshield when they run into a fucking goose.  That's the best I could do for you.  Yeah. 
[01:24:30]  That's fine.  Yeah, it's Sully's windshield.  No, well, anyway, anyway, you know, you know, what might've happened.  What might've happened?  Okay.  I fell.  Bill might've flung them out into the Elizabeth air one night.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  This is what might've happened.  No, no, no, no.  All right, for guys.

I would hope so  If you were swearing on his grave  Yeah, that would be a little creepy  If he wasn't  Yeah  Every time Diane knows 
[01:32:00]  I am white about something  She hangs down all up on me  And we don't talk for three or four days  Is that it?  It's because of hell drinking  So Diana, comment  Yes  Stop looking at your phone and comment  Yeah  That is why  She doesn't talk to me for a couple days at a time  Because she knows what I say to her  Is right  She doesn't want to go for help  She doesn't want to do anything  She's gonna be 52 years old in a couple weeks  Lincoln, Lincoln  I've been thinking  What the heck have you been drinking?  Comment, Diana? 
[01:32:30]  And you know something?  Yeah, I drink  I'm not going to say I don't  I do  I do have my cup of beers  Well, of course  Who doesn't?  Or Saturday  But that doesn't mean I drink seven days a week  24 hours a day  I have a job  Right  You have a job  And I have an apartment that I gotta keep on  You have an apartment and a job  Diana?  Yes  Diana, comment  Diana, comment on that?  It's true  It's true  And she knows  That I know  She's gonna end up getting cirrhosis  If she doesn't have cirrhosis  She's got cirrhosis  I don't have cirrhosis  You do 
[01:33:00]  Well, you know what, Diana?  You're gonna end up with hepatitis C  Oh, shit  How do you get hepatitis C from natty ices?  I don't know  Cut on the can?  That's what the beer does to you  Oh, lady dying  Wow  And I don't know if they're talking to you about getting help  But they were talking to you and I've been talking about getting help  You gotta go to rehab, lady dying  You gotta go to rehab  You're not  Okay  There's no way around it  You're not  Diana, you don't wanna go for 30 days  You had a good friggin' job 
[01:33:30]  You had a better job than I do  Oh, shit  Yeah, well  I realized that already  I already know that  It was a whole lot better than what I have  And you lost it  And so what?  I mean, I might be working a lot of years with what I have in mine  But let me tell you one thing  She had the best job anybody could friggin' have  Oh, yeah?  Was it reasonable?  She had to mess that up  And you know what?  They gave her so many friggin' chances  Years and years and years ago  And she refused to go to rehab  That was the Budweiser job  Why'd you refuse to go to rehab? 
[01:34:00]  No, I went to rehab  They put me in rehab  But Diana  Okay, but then I just went back to my old habits again  That's what happens  Exactly  Because you don't wanna control yourself  Yeah, you gotta control yourself  You can't even get out and walk  How many times do I tell you, Diana, let's go out for a walk?  Yeah  Join the friggin' gym with me  I go to the gym four times a week  And it shows, Marianne  Absolutely  And it shows  And we can tell  That Jazzercise is doing wonders on that body of yours 
[01:34:30]  She will not even step foot in the friggin' gym  Diana, why not?  I mean, Marianne  Marianne's got quite a fuckable little body  If you don't mind me saying so  Nice figure  Nice figure now  But I bust my head four days a week  Going to the gym  It shows  It really shows, man  It's nice when you walk away, man  She's got a beautiful figure  She'll even get out of a friggin' house to walk around a goddamn block  Oh, yeah  She can't even walk the Family Dollar  Family Dollar is three blocks away from my house  And she don't even walk the Family Dollar 
[01:35:00]  Well, we now believe she can't hold a job though, Marianne  She's in bad shape  She can't hold a job  She's wearing adult diapers today  Yeah  And it's good that you guys are offering her to go up there this week  And you guys are paying her  But then what's gonna happen next week  Exactly  She doesn't have a penny to her pen  Exactly  She doesn't have a damn penny to her name  Yeah  Because she spent it all in TGI Fridays  She makes everybody else rich except for her  She's wearing adult diapers  I don't know anything about that 
[01:35:30]  Diana, tell her  Tell her  Yeah, I am  I'm wearing adult diapers in case I have an accident  Diana, you're 52 years old  Ninety people  Ninety-year-old people  Ninety-year-old people  Yeah, ninety-year-olds  Why are you wearing them?  Why do you wear them?  Because I keep on having accidents  Accidents  You know what?  Because it's your bladder  No, not that kind of accident  It's your bladder  Because you don't  You don't know how to do stomach  Stomach exercises  Not that kind of accident  Not a tinkle accident  The other kind  She's having duty accidents 
[01:36:00]  Number two  But she was peeing herself yesterday as well  Yeah  It was coming out from both ends yesterday  Yeah  Or all three ends  Yeah  What three ends?  Mouth, ass, and vagina  Look why you have an accident  Look why you have an accident  You don't do anything  You sit  You don't exercise  You don't move around  Wait, you're saying though  If she does stomach exercises  That'll help the bladder situation?  That won't help her bladder  Okay  Oh, okay  All right, cool  Marion has a 1930s answer  Yeah  Actually, you know what?  Do a few jumping jacks 
[01:36:30]  That is good for your stomach  Because I know it  Yeah  And it shows  Got to say  It shows  Yeah  I'm going to tell you  I had a headache  Seven years ago  Jesus  And I was full of the stomach exercises  Slotting off that  Oh my god  Right  We understand  Anymore on your infomercial, Marion?  And she's got everything in her  And she's got everything in her  She's never even had anything  She's never even had fricking surgery, Diana  And she don't do anything  I think she's giving me tough love 
[01:37:00]  That's what I think it is  Oh, you think?  Yeah  Could be  I know  Try to do sit-ups at least  At least do sit-ups  At least do sit-ups  It's more than laying on a couch at night and doing sit-ups when you need that  Right  Try doing some sit-ups  I can do that  Yeah, sure I can  You're not going to do that  We all know that  But you don't  I used to  When?  Oh my god  When I was trying to keep thin  When I was married years ago  Oh boy  I used to do stuff like that  I mean, Marion  Do you know that Diana used to have anal sex in her boyfriend's car? 
[01:37:30]  Every weekend  Every weekend in the 80's  I have to tell you, sir  I think that's very disgusting  That she had anal sex with her ex-boyfriend  What?

No, Marion  You don't understand, though  Back in the 80's  Hello?

[01:42:30]  Ooh, Sam  Hold on, there's a few things going on  Marion, why do you want us to give her beer?  No, because you know why?  Maybe you should just give her a six pack and tell her to go to fuck home instead of sitting at a goddamn most expensive place you can in a city  I'm not going there today  That's true  I'm definitely not  Yeah, you know why? Because you probably spent $150 yesterday  Ooh  No, I did not, no, no, no  Not in one place, no  You have $7 left  Huh?  You spent  Then you went home with the Bayway liquor  Yes  Didn't you mention that liquor store 
[01:43:00]  Oh, enough with that guy  God  Oh, well, you know, well Bill is, uh  What?  I just  He did, he yelled at me all day yesterday  Who is this Bill guy?  I still don't understand Bill  Hello Bill  Bill always follows that  He yelled at me all day yesterday just for me going to TGIF  He's the piece of shit that Lady Di lives  Yeah  Because Diana, you need to save some of that money  Why is Bill yelling at  In society you ain't going to have no money  Marion, why is  What the hell are you doing? 
[01:43:30]  Thank you  Why is Bill yelling at Lady Di, Marion?  Oh, that's because I went over to, uh  I went to TGIF Fridays instead of going home  Jesus Christ, what's going on?  I'm going to tell you guys something  For real  Yeah  When Diane got that inheritance from her father  I see  Her father was  Her mom were both good people  They  I kept telling her  Put it in the bank  Save some for a day that you  When it runs  No, she had to go spend it within a friggin nine months  Nine months, eight months  Oh 
[01:44:00]  She had to go through it like water  But how much did she get?  I don't really know  I don't really know  About  About  She got a lot  How much?  Around  Around $60,000  And you went through it in nine months?  About $60,000  Mmm  Yeah  Hold on  God  There's so much going on here that we gotta explore  No, no, no, no  I also took care of Bill  But  You know  When you spend the $60,000 on  On Bill?  Shut the fuck up  Wait 
[01:44:30]  Wait  I also bought clothes  You know  I bought food  I brought food into the house  I mean  You bought a lot of beer  It just wasn't only for beer  That's what I'm trying to say  You know how hard it is to spend $60,000 in nine months?  Marion  I don't know  Let me tell you how hard it is  I told her to take a vacation  To go somewhere  Because she complains  Oh, you're lucky  You go on two cruises a year  Yeah  Right  And I say  Right  It's a cruise  I go nowhere else  Hello?  Do you think  I would love to see Diana Cruz 
[01:45:00]  Just vomiting all over the fucking ship  Oh, she's great  And shitting in the pool  Quarantine  No, I'd probably get seasick, yeah  Because I remember one time I got seasick  I understand  When did you get seasick?  When I was about eight or nine  Eight years old  Oh, okay  You know  My parents took me to Italy  Okay  And I did get  I did get sick on the ship  To go down the shore for three or four days  Just to get away from Elizabeth  He wouldn't even do that  That is true  60 large you went through  60 large just drinking  Yeah 
[01:45:30]  You wouldn't even get out of Elizabeth  You drank away $60,000  I completely understand why  No, no, no  I completely understand why Lady Di drinks now, by the way  Yeah, yeah  Okay  No, I did not drink  Colin got it  I did not drink away $60,000  Yes, you did  I did use it for other things, too  So  I think you drank away $60,000  You drank away $60,000?  For the most part  No, no  Closed shopping  Closed shopping  So what did you spend the $60,000 on?  Well, like she said  Give us a short list  All right  Beer, obviously  Closed  Closed 
[01:46:00]  Bill  Beer  Closed  And more beer  Don't forget  I went food shopping, too  And food  But Diana  You bought $60,000 in food in nine months  You don't stand behind the stove and boil water  You don't cook  No, I don't cook  Because Bill  You don't  You know the reason why I don't cook  Why?  Because Bill doesn't want me to cook  Why?  Because Bill doesn't want me to cook  Why?  Because he thinks I do everything wrong  When I cook  Exactly  What do you make of that he didn't like?  Oh, one time I  Well, this is the truth 
[01:46:30]  Okay  One time I made, when he was working  I made spaghetti  Nice  That's easy to make  You probably got sauce all over the stove  No, I did not  No, no, no  That's when we were in a rooming house  You probably bought the spaghetti  Rooming house  No, I didn't  No, no, no  This was a rooming house  We had to share a kitchen  Okay  A rooming house  And what happened was I forgot to put in sauce in the spaghetti  Okay  So when I brought the spaghetti back up again, it was sticking  And Bill said to me, look what you did 
[01:47:00]  You forgot to put salt in the water  You forgot to put water in the water  It's not salt  Oh my god  I hate this  Hold on, Diana's annoyed  Why are you annoyed, Diana?  I forgot to put sauce in the spaghetti  I fucking hate this  Because we were sharing a kitchen  How do you forget to put  There's only two ingredients in spaghetti  Spaghetti and sauce  How do you forget the sauce part?  Because she means sauce  Because everything really sticks  No, you put the sauce  A little bit of sauce on the spaghetti  After it's done  Right  So it doesn't stick together 
[01:47:30]  Gotcha  Or you put a little oil in the water when you're boiling it up  Right  A little oil  Whatever  And I forgot to do that  The salt?  I don't know about salt  Alright, but  You guys put salt in the water  Eating spaghetti and talking about the Campari  Enough about the salt in the water  That doesn't prevent it from sticking  Alright, so  You're always talking?  Bill told me  He said, you're Italian  You don't even know how to make spaghetti  Yeah  And I said, well, first of all  Shut up  First of all, my parents 
[01:48:00]  Sausages  A little wine  Some sugar  You may have to cook for a big drug one time  My parents did most of the cooking  I need a fucking drink  Alright  Shit  My parents did most of the cooking  And I really did not cook  We have to go to the pit book written mattresses  Alright, Clemenza  Try to explain something  I gotta go  Old lady Clemenza  Alright, thank god  Be good  Bye Marian  I love you guys  Alright  Hang up  Yeah  God, shit  Love you, bye  Alright

She's exhausting  No, no, no  She had to go back to work  No, but she hogs the spotlight while you're trying to talk  You don't understand  She cares about me  Yeah, but you don't care about yourself  You gotta care about yourself  I know  I have to care about myself first  That's okay  That's the key  Now, the thing I was trying to say is  When I was living at home  Uh-huh  My parents did most of the cooking  Oh  Okay  Yeah  And I was never home to actually watch them  Uh-huh 
[01:49:00]  I was always out  Oh, so you couldn't learn how to cook  I couldn't learn how to cook  My mom tried to teach me  Oh, that's a shame  A long time ago  My mom tried to teach me  Uh-huh  Alright, and I was like  Ah, you know  Because when my dad used to cook  Oh  Alright, wait a minute  Wait a minute  When my dad used to cook at home  Uh-huh  Okay, my dad was a chef  And when he used to cook at home  Uh, the flames  You know  On the frying pan  Right, right  You know, so high  That it scared me  Oh, it scared you  Alright  You look like Louie Anderson, by the way  Is that good or bad?

Um  Let me see  Hold, alright, go ahead  First time he put  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  You did  First time he put it in your hiney  Did you think he was gonna go for the vagina  And he gave you a surprise?  Yeah, yeah  He gave you a big surprise  Where he just stuck it right in your butt  Oh, those 80s were wild  Yeah  I said, I told him, wrong hole  Oh  Did you?  And he said, no it's not  He didn't care  He didn't care  He kept on going  He kept going, right?  Yeah  Did he just bury it balls deep? 
[01:53:30]  No  Well, he would go slow?  No, no, no  No?  It hurt  Yeah  Did you say ow?  Of course I said ow  I said take it out  And what did he do?  He didn't  No  So basically  So basically your fucking head's banging against the fucking window  And he's railing you in the hiney?  No, no, no  He held on to me  Yeah, on your hips  Yeah  To make sure you couldn't pull away  Yeah  To make sure I don't bang myself either  Wow  Yeah  What are you, autistic? 
[01:54:00]  So where did he actually ejaculate?  Into your hiney, right?  No, he did not  No  He pulled it on your back?  Yeah  He never blew inside your ass?  No  How'd you wipe your back off?  Not bad  He had tissue  Enjoy your  Yes  He had tissue  He had tissue back then  He had tissues  That's nice  Well, you know, like I was in my twenties back then  Yeah  I know  I didn't know  We're all  Yeah  We all were crazy back then  I thought he was going to stay with me if I did that with him  You wanted a relationship  I wanted a relationship 
[01:54:30]  Gotcha  And you thought if you allowed him to put in your hiney in the car after work  That that would be like  Right  Yeah, after work on a Friday  After a few beers  And a Saturday  And  Oh  Part of Sunday  Because we were on different shifts  Wow  Friday, Saturday and Sunday  Yeah  Throughout the 80's  You had to take it in the ass  Fucked your ass all weekend  Didn't he?  Now we know why  Yeah, but he did it the other way too  Now we know why she can't keep her pooing  That's true  But  That is a good point 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, no, no, no  But we did it the  Let me ask you this  The traditional way too  Did you start shaking when they played  Working for the weekend?  Back in the 80's  Yeah, I was looking forward to it  I really liked the guy  Well  Wow, yeah  And it always ended up in the back end  You know  Lady Di  Yeah  How many times would you say you took it in that special spot?

So-so 
[01:57:30]  Why only so-so?  And why only one time?  You told him no more?  Come on, tell us  Oh man, there might be a story here  Come on  He's not listening  Let us hear  Okay  Go ahead  No, he can't listen to me anyway  No  Okay  Oh no  Come on  It wasn't a happy ending, let's just put it that way  What do you mean?  Let us know, what happened?  What happened?  He didn't come  Oh no, why?  Yeah?  I don't know  Did he lose his erection?  Oh, maybe he had a few drinks and uh 
[01:58:00]  The whiskey dick?  That was it  Mr. Softy, huh?  Yeah  He was a lousy fuck  Whiskey dick  He yelled at you yesterday, will you get home today?  I guess so, yeah  Well, he can't hear it  What are you saying?  He was a lousy fuck  Yeah, he was lousy in bed  In bed  And he didn't want that anymore  And you obviously deserve better than that  He wasn't giving?  No, he wasn't giving  He wasn't generous?  Did he go down on you?  Did he?  Ah  Did he?  Ah 
[01:58:30]  He used to, yeah  He used to  A lot, right?  No, no, no  What?  A few times, yeah  He used to be regular  Bill used to go down on you once in a while  Yeah  Regular, regular  He just used to  He used to do it almost every day  No, no, no  Not every day  How often would he lick it?  A couple times a week  Wait, I thought they only had sex once  Bill?  I know  What?  Bill would lick it on weekends, right?  So you were  You and Bill were an item for a while  Yeah  Yeah, you could say that  You definitely did have sex more than once  That's cool  Yeah, well that  You call that sex?  Why'd you say once? 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, huh?  What?  Why'd you say once?  It was a lot of box licking  And a lot of dick sucking, I bet  So you'd suck his dick  He'd lick your box  Yeah, what do you usually do when you have sex?  Stuff like that  Ugh  Right?  I'm not a monster  I don't know  So you'd suck his dick  He'd lick your box  And you'd fucking pass out  Well one time he tried to, you know  Do it proper and it didn't work out  It didn't work out  He's a limpy  He's a softy  Yeah, he did  He's a lousy fuck  It just didn't work out  So you guys were boyfriend and girlfriend 
[01:59:30]  And now you're just roommates  We're just roommates now  Gotcha  Okay, now  He's terrible in the sack though  Just say it  I wouldn't know  He can't hear us  It's awful  But when he tried to fuck you  He brags about him having other girlfriends every once in a while  Oh yeah  I said go ahead, go out  You don't care, right?  You can't satisfy them either  Yeah, he can't make anybody come  How big is he?  I don't know, huh?  How big is he?  How big is his penis?  Tell me the truth  He's a pig? Small?  Normal size  Like?  What's a normal size?  Four inches  Seven inches  Seven?  Yeah

[02:01:30]  And a Bobby Kelly interview  Nice  Is up now  So look for it on iTunes  It's Carmody Central, it's called  And she's really funny  And it's gonna be a great, great podcast  So if you want to, support that  Very cool  We'll be back  Who's thing?  Yeah  What else we got today?  That guy  We have a guest  I don't know his name, Jimmy  Harry  And I don't know his last name  I forget  But he's the comedian  Right  Who rented his apartment out  And all of those  Came back and found the fat orgy 
[02:02:00]  We talked about that yesterday  Okay  And he came up to me at the comedy cellar  And he goes, hey man, thanks for the shout out  Oh  And he goes, yeah, that was my apartment  I'm like, oh, okay, right  So he happened to be in the building today  So here he is  He's making the rounds, is he?  Let's bring him in  A coup for a comedian  A story like that  Gets a little bit of press  Come on in, sir  Take a seat  What's going on, brother?  Hey, guys  How you going?  Jim  Hi, buddy  You've got a hell of a story there 
[02:02:30]  Yeah  Why would you rent out your apartment first?  300 and something bucks a night  Oh, nice  If you're a comic  And you're going to be out of town  Why not take 700 bucks?  Oh, okay  So you leave to, you know, do your comedy across the country  And then on the weekends your apartment's just sitting there  So you're like, alright, I can make a few bucks  Yeah  How many times have you rented it out?  I have rented it out  What am I doing here?  I rented it out  While I'm watching, he's completely panicking and fumbling with it  There you go  There we go 
[02:03:00]  Sort of it  Okay  It actually clicks down a little further  Now turn that in  There you go  Why would you help him?  I don't know  It's just  What's wrong with you?  It takes forever  It gives me anxiety  Night four of no sleep  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, because, well, the first night there was no surface to sleep on  Oh, right  Wait, wait, wait  Before we get into all that, slow down  So, I didn't even know there were like companies or websites where you could just rent out your place like that  Yeah, there's a handful of them 
[02:03:30]  Right  One had the unfortunate circumstance of having an orgy shop in a comedian's apartment  But basically you go online and go, hey, I got this place in Times Square  You can rent it out, right?  Yeah, so  And have you rented it out before or was this the first time?  Yeah, no, I've done it a handful of times  Going out for a gig or going on vacation  Yeah  You leave all your stuff there?  Uh, yeah, I mean, you know, a single guy  So I have a bunch of expensive musical equipment, but, you know  Aside from that, right?  Nothing that you're really too worried about  Yeah, no  And I would bet some of these people would just have maybe a closet or something they could lock up good 
[02:04:00]  To put all their stuff in  Yeah, in hindsight that would have been a good idea  Oh, in hindsight  So you hit the road and you're like, yeah, what the hell?  I'll rent this thing out while I'm on the road  Yeah  It's kind of smart if you're not making a lot of money  You could get some good pocket money coming in  You know, even if you're doing alright  10 days is another like $2,500  Wow  Yeah, it's fast  And literally you hand the key to a doorman  Right  You change the sheets  You pay a cleaning service $80  What did you do?  There's no effort 
[02:04:30]  Don't you just see that by like bed bugs?  Like somebody in my space like that would freak me out  Like you never know who they are or what they're bringing in with them  Yeah  So, you know, you put on a mattress protector  Okay  But those are not rated for an orgy  Right, right  For PBW orgies  Yeah, it's like a kid piece of the bed, you're fine  50 large black men and women coming to your apartment  Wow  Do you have a nice apartment?  I used to  You know, in New York it's luxurious if you can't see your toilet from your pillow 
[02:05:00]  Right  So I was doing okay there at a door  I paid the extra $100  Nice  For the door  Was it a one bedroom, two bedroom?  Studio  Alcove Studio  Studio  Yeah  So it worked out pretty well in the past  But then finally you got fucked over and made the papers, that's for sure  Yeah  It was a big story here in New York  Hit Gawker and BuzzFeed and now it's in the news in China and France  Really?  Good for you  63 papers, every morning show in the city 
[02:05:30]  Right  So what happened?  You rented it to a guy?  He contacted you?  Guy, David, messages me  He's a verified user, he's got three positive reviews  Now I realize they're all from guys  Oh, okay  And he says, hey, I need a space for my brother and sister-in-law who are in town for a wedding  I don't have room for them  I'm guessing on account of the orgy  Nice  And, alright, he looked like a decent guy  You know, buttoned down shirt 
[02:06:00]  I really have to extend my criteria on judging people  Do you meet these people before you decide, alright, I'm going to run into this person?  I mean, you know, usually they're coming from out of town  So you don't get to meet him, but he hands, you know, at this time I met him  I handed him the keys at like 6 o'clock and I left  Did you have any weird, like, gut feelings about the guy?  No, no, you know, he just seemed like a soft-spoken, very large guy  Possibly suffering from hypertension  How large?  Large, like, maybe wide in the door large, kind of, just like a big guy 
[02:06:30]  Like, one of those guys who's the size that their first impression, no matter what else they have going on, is big  That's a big guy, right, okay  Big guy  And, yeah, I hand him the keys at like 6 o'clock, I go to have dinner  It's one of these things that just keeps getting delayed  I end up showing up at like 11.30  And he's standing outside with, I guess what you'd call a posse  Guys in, guys in hip-hop attire  Uh-huh  You know, hats matching the shoes, if you will  Correct, yeah, yeah 
[02:07:00]  And he's there and he's got that headset glowing  And you say, like, only a pimp has that headset nowadays  Right  And he goes, I go, what's going on?  He goes, they're shutting us down  They're shutting it down  Alright, hold on, okay, before you get to that  The one part that made me slightly suspicious about your story was that  You told him you were leaving town, right?  Yeah  Alright, so you go to dinner  But then you go back to your place to get your luggage  That was a little weird  Well, I was having dinner around the corner 
[02:07:30]  You know, I'd like to live, well now everyone knows where I live, so why not say it?  Right  I live on between 18th and 19th, I was meeting someone at the diner on 14th and 6th  Good stuff diner, delicious  And I'm like, I'm not going to lug my luggage around New York  That's the way to let everyone know you're a tool to be taken advantage of  So I just left it by the doorman  Figuring I'll just walk the four blocks back  Oh, so you didn't go back to your apartment, the paper didn't explain that  You weren't going back into the apartment  No, I went to the front door, but my apartment's 10 feet from the door  So, okay, hold on, hold on  Yeah, hold on, because I'm helping you out 
[02:08:00]  Because they didn't explain any of that in the paper  So when you gave the guy the keys, you were done with him, like, alright, have fun, whatever  Yeah, I assume that, you know, it's two people sleeping over in the apartment  I'm never going to see him again  I got you, because the paper made it sound like you went all the way back up to your apartment  But you left, but you left your luggage down with the doorman  You went to have dinner, now I'm coming back to get my luggage and go  Yeah, and I'm literally 10 feet behind the doorman  That makes sense  If you're going to hold an illicit, illegal orgy  Right, maybe  This was the wrong apartment  Yeah, yeah  You know, you couldn't be with better earshot of the staff 
[02:08:30]  So you come back a little later than you were expecting  Yeah  And this guy says, with the headset, they're shutting us down  He goes, they're shutting us down  And I thought that was an extreme phrase to use for brother and sister-in-law  Staying in for a wedding  How did he react to what he saw you? Did he act surprised to see you or no?  So first he thought I was one of the guys coming to the party  It was clear, because you're like, oh, they're shutting us down  And I'm like, well, what do you mean?  And then it registered that I don't look like the rest  You know, one of these things is not like the other  And the look of horror on his face was  If it wasn't real, you'd shout, overacting 
[02:09:00]  And I see the super sitting in the front of the building looking pissed  And that's the way every super always looks  But he's in the front of the building on a Friday night  And that's not a good sign  Right, right  So I walk in, I see the front door open  I see people walking in and out  I come in there, there's another 8 to 10 people  And they're carrying my furniture out the back door  There's two guys carrying a table  And my first thought was, they're just robbing me 
[02:09:30]  Like this was clever  Like you look up a nice apartment, you see the stuff inside  And you pay a few hundred bucks and you steal thousands of dollars and stuff  Second thought was, you can't find movers this efficient when you're paying  You know, next time you gotta move, just throw an orgy  And then the third was, they really opened up the space  For a couple of months I've been thinking about moving the couch  Sure, sure  I'm not, you know, I gotta ask my friend how to dress me  So I don't know how to move furniture  Yeah, so Feng Shui moment 
[02:10:00]  Feng Shui  Except for the moisture and pubes they left all over  Oh shit  And then I noticed that they had flipped the signs  Like I had Eric Clapton albums up  I had Carl Ryder and Mel Brooks and Carlin albums  Like, you know, that's really the only thing I care  I got that and I got like an invite from Obama from years ago  For the Hanukkah party at the White House  And I think black orgy, that's the thing you do  Oh yeah  But they flipped him over 
[02:10:30]  And I thought, okay this must be a filming thing  And they're afraid of trademark  I was thinking about like the time like Hamas had a knockoff Mickey Mouse  Right  And Disney went after them and shut down Hamas' like hate channel  It was like the only organization scarier than Hamas is Disney's attorneys I'm guessing  And so, but I didn't see any cameras  And they go, oh no, we're not filming  We're not filming, but this is not a filming operation  And I was like, well I gotta call the cops  So I go out to the front door, we call 911 from the doorman  So wait, the cops, they were already getting thrown out by the super 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, but they were kinda hanging around and grabbing the furniture  And so it was  Why were they putting it in the back?  It's an interesting choice of phrase  But they  They wanted more room  Yeah, they needed more room  Oh, okay, they weren't stealing  Yeah, so he came like  He came back an hour after the cops had left  And the doorman has the door locked  Because another 27 people had come  Come on  Come on  22 guys, 5 women asking where to party at  Oh my god  Not great diction 
[02:11:30]  How many were in your apartment?  Yeah, I felt like I saw 18 in front  And then another like 10  Wow  So we're rounding about 50  50 people in your little studio  Yeah, yeah  Oh my god  Were they fucked there?  Or was it, I guess that's what it was  Or was it just a meet and greet kind of thing?  Well no, it's it  On Twitter he advertised as a triple x freak fest  In your apartment  Which is redundant, right?  I mean  Sure  One of those words is not needed  What's, can you write his Twitter down?  Uh  It's also on the air  Okay 
[02:12:00]  I wanna see it first  Before we get jumped  So we advertised on Twitter  Yeah  That this is going down in your apartment  And then you run it out for the weekend  Yeah, yeah  And we, we, so  So the stuff is  The stuff is out of the backyard  And it's moist  And we can't figure out why  Because it wasn't raining  Uh  This is the weekend of St. Paddy's  This is just last week at St. Paddy's  Also Purim  So different kind of festivals  Sure  All around the city  Right  And one in my apartment  And um  We, uh  We, we look and we see  Uh 
[02:12:30]  First of all  It's just very strange  Like if you're just having family over  And you're just having a gathering  You, like  Someone in the family is gonna wanna sit  Uh huh  So why are you taking apart the couch  And moving it?  Uh  He came back an hour later  He goes to the doorman  The doorman had to lock the door  Everybody kinda leaves  He's standing by the door  And he says, uh  Could you, you know  I, I left my shoes  In his kitchen cabinet  Which I think is the most twisted thing  Wow  That's weirder than a 50 person orgy  The guy probably wanna take his shoes off  And not get them stolen  Yeah, he didn't want them stolen 
[02:13:00]  Stolen  Well actually I think dirty  Uh huh  Because why were they removing everything?  I think  Yeah  I think because things were moist and such  Yeah  And we didn't realize how bad it was  And then I think it was  We had ABC, CBS and Pix come in  In the span of hours  I was photographing reporters holding hands  Next to each other  Cause it was like this weird  And not like, who's showing up in your apartment?  Uh huh  Uh huh  And uh  And one of them has an HD camera  With the spotlight built in  And he goes to take just some like B-roll  And he points it down at the bed  And shouts, pubes! 
[02:13:30]  And I didn't think it was possible  To feel dirtier  That weekend  He actually said that?  Yeah, he just goes pubes!  And we looked  And in fact  Oof  Yeah, exactly  Good morning everybody  Jeez  Um, yeah  And uh  You know, so I uh  I uh  I tweeted  I  First I called Airbnb  His account by the way has been deleted  The guy who you gave me his account  Was Twin Green or whatever  And you could see a couple of references to him  But they  I guess he yanked his account  So yeah  The letter I  The letter I 
[02:14:00]  So I call  I call Airbnb  And I say hey you gotta  So you go through and rent your apartment  Yeah  And I get a call center  The guy's like oh I'm just at a call center in  I don't know if you're like Idaho  Whatever  And I'm like well that's  You know, this is above the pay grade of a call center  And so uh  My friend John  Uh came over  Is a friend of mine who runs a site called Windows  Where they take pictures of like fashion windows  He's used to photography sets and such  He goes no this is weird  Nobody comes over  And just photographs  Uh  Furniture  Furniture does a setup without getting some sort of release or protection or whatever 
[02:14:30]  Sure  And this is a crew that clearly done this before  So we google the phone number  We find this  This black doctor  Ruth  I don't know what kind of doctor  Uh  Who says  Call this number  The same number on the Airbnb listing  Uh  For this triple x freak fest  Um  And so uh  I go  Okay time to write an open letter  To Airbnb  And then tweet it out to Airbnb and the CEO  Uh huh  About how you just had a triple x freak fest 
[02:15:00]  Uh you know  Pornography ring slash orgy in my apartment  Uh  Do you have to sign something when you join this  Hey we  That this company accepts no responsibility for anything that happens in your apartment  No I mean they've accepted responsibility  Oh  I mean even through the act like they had to put me in a hotel for a week  Uh one because there's fifty pimps and prostitutes that know exactly where I live  And what's in my apartment  Oh boy  They pay to have the locks changed right away  Uh  Oh they're doing damage control right now  Yeah yeah yeah  They you know they they immediately uh  They said they immediately wired uh money for the for the physical damage to the to the stuff 
[02:15:30]  Um  The money hasn't appeared in the bank yet  Uh huh  So Chase hasn't seen it yet  What what kind of damage besides moist couches and stuff  I was you know I was in in band an electric drum set it's like you you you you these things add up right  It's a fifty six hundred dollar drum set  Where is it?  You've got a guitar  Gone?  It's just like smashed  Oh  You hit a drum set one way and it's fine  You hit another way and it's it's gone  Oh yeah  The electronics are gone  Uh  Imagine a bunch of fat people in your small apartment 
[02:16:00]  Oh how awful  This smell good reporters kept coming in and they're like what's what's that smell  Yeah and it was like an unidentifiable smell which I guess means you're doing well in life when  It's a new smell  Um  And  Are they going to repaint your apartment?  Are they going to repaint it?  Well the cop comes the second time and he goes you got to get a disaster mitigation service  But was that bad?  And I'm thinking yeah well think about this what line of work are you in that you even know the names of disaster mitigation services  Yeah  You're pretty much a cop he goes well they're going to do an internal investigation for vice  Uh so it's just going straight to vice 
[02:16:30]  Oh  They're like we don't have a report for you it's going to vice  I'm like okay yeah that's going to tank the value  Uh and um  I had some friends I guess who who you know as a Jew in New York I got friends at Mashable and Buzzfeed and Gawker  And so like Gawker and Buzzfeed picks up this  I had like dareairbnb.tumblr.com  I was even suspicious because yahoo bought tumblr and I'm like this is arguably unclean now that they've bought it  Um and uh yeah you know it's just one of those things that starts going viral 
[02:17:00]  You start just your phone starts buzzing non-stop  I just got a radio request from Ireland  Uh it's in the news in China  Uh in Brazil and France  Let me ask you what about the uh what are they going to do to you in the because you have a lease  You're not allowed to do stuff like that so what are they going to do with you having uh allowed all these  Even renting it just even if it was legit you rent it just to two people  That's got to make your landlord go like your lease is not valid  Yeah he sent a uh you know a text saying you know check your lease  Um now I sent uh you know I sign a form every time I have guests over like this with the doorman 
[02:17:30]  With their contact info names and everything and I said you know three people  So it's a little on the building that you know even if you round to five that's that's a distance from 25  Yeah um and it's a co-op in Chelsea so they they do have a 25 person orgy limit  Wait there's a co-op?  Yeah so I'm just in a co-op building?  Yeah so that they're scarier than the orgy  No kidding  Yeah they're rough man 
[02:18:00]  No kidding  You ain't lying  They are pretty bad  So what's going to happen to you and how much longer was your lease for?  Uh about I don't know six eight months  Are you allowed to stay or do you have to leave?  It's been it's been made pretty clear  Okay you gotta go  That I gotta go  Um and also it's just it just doesn't  I mean if you if if all of a sudden everyone knew your exact address  I wouldn't care about that because addresses to be honest  Anybody who knows how to use a computer can find your address  But the apartment  Yeah yeah yeah yeah  But the actual apartment 10 feet from the front door  It's not worth it 
[02:18:30]  And these particular this group of 50 probably not thrilled to have been outed  Yeah but they tricked you  Yeah I don't see anybody going back to your apartment to get revenge  Because they threw fat people out of your house  Yeah no I do  I don't see a bunch of fat people going back to murder you for it  So they all figured out that they had to be having some crazy ass orgy in your apartment  You know they texted photos of other I guess other events that they've done  Right  I don't know who's doing their flyers but uh yeah it was uh it was it was pretty  Why wouldn't they rent just a cheap hotel room somewhere?  That's it well yeah or a warehouse space or something with some beds 
[02:19:00]  Like what the fuck are they doing?  There's a million hotels that would just accept that  Clearly these guys have boundary issues you know  Hotels?  They're not thinking  They're not thinking hey this is an inappropriate place  The guy needed a headset?  Why did he need a headset at the front door?  I guess he's getting a lot  He had 50 people calling and texting all night  He had a lot of traffic  Holding that up to your ear while you're having an orgy is inconvenient  I guess he needs hands free you know  His hands are busy somewhere else  That's fucking  But that's the type of thing I'd be afraid of  I would never let  I would have trouble letting a friend stay in my space 
[02:19:30]  I'm so fucking paranoid about my stuff being touched  Exactly  The idea of strangers coming in man  Like I don't care how much they pay me  Yeah  Oof  That's just creepy  So you gonna get rid of your bed now or do you have to get rid of your shit?  That's not broken?  Yeah beds gone  Couches gone  I mean it's also it's just  It was a white couch  It's torn and dirty  There's  I mean there's massive amounts of footprints through the  Because the back alley that they were throwing everything into  It's a cover of a roof so it's all tar  It's all dirty  Tar  So you don't want 
[02:20:00]  I mean A you just don't want that stuff tracked into your apartment  Beats all over the furniture  So they basically just threw all your stuff out the back door to make more room  For an orgy yeah  Not giving a crap if it was messing it up  They were they were naked in there  And  I mean I  The super walked in on that  So I guess maybe fortunately I didn't see that  I only saw the social media  Wow  Presentation  So wait now what what but but the guy who signs up for that  Doesn't he have to give his real information to this website  So if he contacts you  Or does he not connected to the website at all?  Well that's the thing it says verified 
[02:20:30]  And I gotta say the verification process you know  Alright but  Didn't work this time  If he didn't get caught how was he gonna you know get your  Your apartment back in shape before you got home?  These guys were really efficient moving the furniture  Like if I didn't know what they did  But they would have been able to get your apartment back in shape you think?  Well you know  With that smell  It's like my friend Johnson  You'd come back and you'd say  Well things are out of place  Right  And a few things look dirty  And maybe you'd file a claim for a few hundred bucks for damage  Sure sure  You know but  Do you have before and after photos though? 
[02:21:00]  Because then they could dispute it and go no that was already broken  Yeah we have a whole  Yeah I took a ton of photos  Beforehand?  Yeah because the Airbnb listing  You know people see what they're getting  So  Yeah I mean that's the other thing like  The actual inside of that apartment's been all over the news  So it's just like a weird place  Yeah  To live  I mean who would want to come back there or hang out  Are you still in a hotel?  I'm still in a private home  Yeah so I'm in a hotel  Still  Yeah  What hotel what room?  Exactly 
[02:21:30]  Exactly  But you know a comic just wants to spend extra time in his own city in a hotel  Yeah  All we need is to live out of a suitcase  Well now are you done doing this with the site?  With the  With Airbnb?  Yeah  Well certainly in this apartment  Yeah I mean I think  You know it's a risk reward thing  And  A I don't think that I'd be the most anonymous guy on that site  Right  If I went back on there  You know it'd be sort of like a  I'd be a target of pranks  Yeah  If you will  Like hold an orgy in Ari's apartment 
[02:22:00]  And the more you learn about this you realize  Interesting charity fundraising  A lot of people are doing this  Running out their apartments to other people and stuff  Yeah they've got 11 million rentals  I mean you know in their defense maybe they've had five orgies out of 11 million  At least that have been caught  We have a we have a friend of the family  I said it differently yesterday  Friend of the family  And she switched apartments  She has a you know Manhattan apartment  And I think she went to Spain  And they switched for a week  Like didn't use each other's apartment  Yeah  So but they didn't have any orgies or anything going on 
[02:22:30]  Right that you know of  It's almost like you want to have cameras in your own apartment when you've got it  No kidding man  Yeah  Wow  I'm fucked up man  Fuck  Jesus  Yeah  Where can people check you out?  Thank you Ari  Where can people check you out?  Twitter Ari Teeman  How do you spell that?  A-R-I-T-E-M-A-N  You get any followers out of this?  Yeah  I think it actually froze  You know it freezes at certain points before they verify  And then the hashtag Airbnb Freak Fest  Is trending  Taking off  This was the number one Facebook trend yesterday 
[02:23:00]  It beat the Westboro Baptist church founder dying  Did he die?  Well he was dying  Oh  Dying  But I felt like I did something for society  Yeah  And just knocking that guy down a peg  Yeah yeah yeah  I didn't feel so good about the plain people  But him I was happy to knock down  Right  Fred Phelps on his death bed  Yeah yeah  Wow that's a  Hell of a story  Hell of a tale  Yeah  And has it helped you out getting gigs?  Yeah  I'm at a few clubs tonight  And you know I got a tour  I got some TV production studios messaging about doing shows 
[02:23:30]  Nice  Not a bad thing  So maybe in the end this was a great thing that happened  Yeah you know if you're not tied to your backyard apartment  Yeah  We were just over at Wake Up with Taylor  And she's like  You lost a backyard apartment  Like it doesn't matter what you get out of this  Right  Yeah that's  It's really your values in life  Yeah yeah yeah here in New York  Not easy to get  Yeah I mean my thing is just really curling up in bed for half the day  But I can't do that right now  Uh huh  It's funny about Fred Phelps  I'm reading it  You got me thinking  And it said that he's still alive 
[02:24:00]  But he was excommunicated from the Westboro Baptist church  For advocating a kinder approach between church members  And I'm wondering if Shirley Roper  Putting that out there  And the elders defeated  Fred Phelps called for a kinder treatment of fellow church members  Oh I said  Okay  Not of gays or anything  No  But of each other  And they threw them out  Like what a shitty face  Can't be kind to those gays  What kind of church has infighting about infighting  Wow 
[02:24:30]  Yeah  Well the Westboro Baptist church that's for sure  By the way  All right  Well  All right  We got to take a break here  Yes  Thank you very much  I appreciate it  Cool man  Thank you  All right  They're rich  And they pee  But they're done  Welcome back to the OPN Entity Show  On Sirius XM  I'm scared to look at my Twitter 
[02:25:00]  I'm not going to lie to you  I thought Jimmy's boy did all right though there  You boy  That's your boy  That's your boy  What did you read  Did you read this  That one in orange  Well the orange ones are the ones that have us in it me or anyone I follow I get to me 
[02:25:30]  and then the blue is like random people that follow me and stuff yeah what Twitter app is  that I use Twitter later I just use the Twitter the regular Twitter and you know I like Twitter  later the pictures show up on the side and a little window like that so I don't keep  clicking on the same fucking Photoshop that people send me right I enjoy the Twitter later and I paid 
[02:26:00]  a little extra for the plus whoa no ads in there and my shit I think it was like 100 499 yeah like  five bucks five bucks well worth it thank you I've been using it for you thank you yes it is so that  was good that was good yep all right okay anyway let's see what else is going on today what about  uh what about your boy de Blasio there right boy de Blasio boy de Blasio just uh just instantly settled 
[02:26:30]  a lawsuit with the New York City against um the fight against these wannabe firefighters that  apparently couldn't pass the test black and Hispanic uh applicants for 98 million dollars  this fucking cocksucker de Blasio just settled just gave him the money the city as he has said during  his campaign desperately needs money yeah and then he just throws 98 million away like this he throws 
[02:27:00]  98 million away because is that his decision the black and Hispanic it was totally his decision it was  absolutely he agrees to pay 98 million to settle fdny minority discrimination lawsuit cocksucker he's  such a a minority cock this guy this mayor he is anything that minorities do uh he will uh give a pass  to any lawsuits they bring he will settle but what is this about it thanks what is this about this is 
[02:27:30]  black and hispanic applicants to the fdny right that were either too stupid or uh not uh a fit enough uh to  pass the the written test so what and well they claim that the test was racist uh against them and uh culturally  biased was that culturally biased so they couldn't pass the test and uh instead of just saying well you know what we at the 
[02:28:00]  fdny we want the best applicants so they do the best job and and they can't say and this test has worked  the worked out well for us for many many years yes yes oh that's yeah that's brutal and uh so so they  they brought a lawsuit one of these militant fucking uh black only groups like the vulcans uh uh in in new  new york um and now they they they get 98 million i'm so glad i don't pay new york city taxes i live 
[02:28:30]  out in the country so that's a little bit of your money jimmy norton enjoy your 98 million well spent  uh well it's it's crazy his approval rating's going way down he stinks it's gone down like nine points  already he's horrible he's only been the mayor for a couple months it's already gone down nine  horrible dumb new yorkers you know how many people that are are well suited for the job that are not  getting the job because they have to hire more minorities no it's also what also came out about 
[02:29:00]  this guy remember i said he's a fucking phony yeah he acts like he's this uh this new yorker that wants  to help everybody and and remember the uh the snow shoveling thing and i said the because he didn't  shovel his neighbor right says a lot about this guy yeah well it turns out that whole thing was set  up ahead of time too oh sure but even the part with his son coming out really the whole thing was set up  it was pro it was written into a schedule like okay the first snowfall this is what you're going to do 
[02:29:30]  we're going to get you outside your home you're going to shovel like a regular guy they they'll endear  you with the people and it was also written down how to shovel properly so you're showing new yorkers  how because he doesn't know how right he did not know how so like you know you're going to bend  your knees with your dumb legs on the paper today and then they said and then later on in the morning  we'll have uh dante come out and and shovel a little as well that whole thing was a uh a setup 
[02:30:00]  photo setup of course photo it was all in his in his schedule in his schedule it's at 7 to 7 20 a.m  snow shoveling front of residence with dante de blasio well the by the way the good the good thing  about this is the uh the fdny now has a chief diversity officer that's a new post chief  diversity officer man i hate that stop trying to fix shit that's not broken  fdny has been just fine on their own for many many years you grab up the applicants 
[02:30:30]  you get the best people for the job and you give them the fucking job how about this why is race how  about this don't have a section don't mention race at all on the uh there you go application  yeah right how about that yeah i guess you have to mention gender because of the name  but why is that why is race mentioned on the like if if you're just filling out applications  and it's completely non-racial there's no racial mention right i maybe how could they say that that 
[02:31:00]  would be discriminatory yeah there's all they're saying the questions are the questions are yeah  that if you grew up in in a certain culture you might not understand well what questions are they  talking about like that's what i want to know this case by the way was one this case was one 2011  it was what it was uh i want to see a u.s court of appeals overturned it and that's what  but the justice department uh filed the lawsuit it was one by it was bush's justice department that 
[02:31:30]  filed the lawsuit uh saying that it was discriminatory to keep blacks out or hispanics out they won  and i guess the uh u.s uh court of appeals overturned that and then they're still fighting it out in  court right so he's kind of just he's ending this and the bloombergs were contesting this completely  and he just said fuck it whatever it's it's but it's it's his whole mindset yeah i know it's it's money  going to um a lot of things in this city that i don't think are we're going to really help a lot 
[02:32:00]  it's going to cost a lot of money i don't think he's going to be able to get a lot of things done  yeah i don't think so no no the the mayor has mayors have a lot of uh power in new york city  especially we'll see a lot so what what was the schedule again uh travis you were you started that  well seven to seven twenty yeah snow shoveling with dante yep and then i think a little later  uh he had some more snow shoveling penciled into his skin oh that was a different day i'm sorry 
[02:32:30]  oh seven to seven fifteen a.m but the penciling into his schedule into his schedule i know these  guys go photo op i know they go for the photo ops all these uh politicians do it but yeah but 98  fucking million dollars in back pay to people who didn't get the job who didn't get the job  they're paying them as if they got the job so stop saying that this city is broke if you're just  throwing around 98 million like it's nothing he withdrew the uh city's appeal to the federal court case 
[02:33:00]  in which the judge uh ruled the city discriminated so he he let the judges uh yes the city did  discriminate by stop and frisk so that's now done all right that's fine with me it's not  whatever it's not people in my building that are getting shot yeah it'll be people in uh  in the neighborhoods that uh you know yeah supposed to be protecting so what happens is  that people say well how come you're not doing good police work okay what is good police work  like i i know of course the constitution is so what what what's the answer yeah what is the answer 
[02:33:30]  just more cops on the street that's not it's not gonna solve it it's not enough cops to put on  every street corner no just not well the the answer is to uh let it happen and then um yes send  cops after the fact yeah to clean up the fucking bodies yep right that's it because weren't gun  crimes going down with stop and frisk mm-hmm yeah the numbers were great new york is an amazing city  over the past uh few years uh just amazing that a city this big and with this many people actually 
[02:34:00]  has had such a low uh gun crime rate and murder rate and what have you but that was because of  really ass kicking police work you see the nypd doing stuff that you don't see them doing in  other cities right they like nipping things in the bud as it's called well this is how it affects  people uh john in long beach john hey hey what's up guys hey john hey um my brother was a fireman 
[02:34:30]  and his brother took the test about seven years ago i think um scored 100 on a physical 100 on a  written and that was positive testing got thrown out because of the racial bias yeah they'll just  throw that out he's working in a fucking bank waiting for because they the white guys brought  a cattle lawsuit against them yeah yeah he's he's waiting to lurch to see if you've got this job  let me ask you a question what is a question that they say is culture because i look over the years 
[02:35:00]  these a lot of the tests were they've been pulling this shit for fucking 20 years but hold on what  is there any accuracy i've been hearing this for my whole life that the tests are very very  culturally biased and maybe some of them are you can look it up what's an example yeah oh does uh  hold on sir club so ken kenny was a civil servant zenos yeah an example is if we do word association  if i say to you cup you say saucer right uh-huh but some disadvantaged people right culturally 
[02:35:30]  can't afford to buy a cup and a saucer so they only have cuts so do it say it saucers are a waste of time  let's do it again give me the word again oh it's a coffee you might say athletic well there you go  athletic that's funny i want to do it though go ahead now now we'll do it the minority one say the word  again cup fuck your mama  hold on a second i'm dealing with 1976 anthony you drive turkey 
[02:36:00]  honky  so what we can't hold on there's a lot of black guys on the force that are on the department that  passed the test on their own but what are the other but is there any let me ask you at the risk of  being called the house liberal i'm asking only asking are there any questions that are legitimately  culturally biased that might even be unintentional but can't you sorry i really couldn't say because i 
[02:36:30]  you know i don't have a test in front of me i'm asking kenny but i would assume you would you  would be able to study for these tests and you would be aware of some of the  they give you free study you know manual so you know what what the test is going to be  oh they have to read and then manuals they have study groups all the fucking groups and learn how to  pass the fuck but wait but wait a minute if it's i'm asking i i think what you're saying is fine but  are there things that they don't tell you that like they're not going to tell you every question in  the study group they might tell you how to prepare no they give you sample questions okay sample 
[02:37:00]  questions yeah what's another one that's been just kind of called because word association  cup and saucer why the fuck is that a question yeah that would be is that really a question  that's ridiculous no that's nonsense something similar to that yeah okay gotcha it's been an  example given do we have any other examples we can find right answer it's a test of character  yeah i'm curious like i've been hearing this for so many years yeah what questions are biased  all right hold on we got a guy that has an actual test john thank you all right thanks john all right 
[02:37:30]  listen i gotta tell you this week when lady died i've been listening to you guys for 20 years  this is the best fucking week of radio i ever heard thank you oh thank you brother yeah we're  really enjoying the hell yeah we gotta believe me room full of hard cocks thanks john and uh  97 i've been on wow sorry about your nephew gets 100 on both parts of the exam and now i mean he's  just waiting for you know he's taking all now he just took the suffix pb test right so hopefully 
[02:38:00]  that'll pull through for him all right thanks john all right thanks boys another guy will maybe get  to me says i took the new uh fdny test and the questions are all jokes if you could read you could  answer correctly of course let's say hi to chris on long island chris yeah guys hi chrissy 98  million this is really starting to sink in dollars what's up chris not much i'm just i'm an active  member i actually just got off of a night tour just drove home to long island from brooklyn  and philly is reading compensation as long as you can read you can pass the test um i actually have 
[02:38:30]  a copy of the test because i am off of it and uh it's you know it's obviously it's out my house so  i'm on my way but even more these guys are getting seniority from back to that test so not only are they  they come in they're going to have let's say i have not they're going to have nine and a half years  work for seniority so they only have to do ten and a half years and then technically they could  retire wow they just hit the lottery retroactive hey i know you don't have the test in front of you 
[02:39:00]  but could you you know give us one of the questions off the top of your head question  one of the question would be like an exposure question you're looking at a building right  they'll tell you what exactly you're looking at is exposure one to the left of it would be exposure  two the rear would be exposure three the right would be exposure four then they'll ask you to  turn the page and they'll say what is exposure three is what and they'll give you five you know  they'll give you five choices front left right bottom back or top what is it and that's literally 
[02:39:30]  what holy shit how is that considered culturally biased though i i don't know involves numbers  nobody knows what this judge had a personal vendetta and that's what it is now we all  all right i gotta go with jimmy on that one give us a question that you think might be uh  you know biased they must give examples of what they think are culturally biased questions right  they don't they don't tell us they just have they have the test and they said it was discriminatory  can you look online for culturally biased fdny test questions like this yeah put it in there 
[02:40:00]  because in court they can't just walk in and say that vaguely they have to give exact examples as  to as to why they're culturally biased and what the questions are right yeah example of culturally  bias all right thank you brother we got we've got a lot wow peter is a fireman hired off one of  those supposedly racist lists pumpkin eater you're talking about  you peter yeah what's up hey peter so explain your story uh yeah basically um there was uh two 
[02:40:30]  lists that they're talking about um that these lawsuits were brought up um about after the fact  um they wound up hiring a bunch of you know full classes uh off of these two lists and then after  the fact they sued saying they were discriminatory uh and then they you know they want they're trying to  get um you know pack pay all that stuff um since those two lists the fire department itself has 
[02:41:00]  dumped millions of dollars into their recruitment uh process and they're going really um above and  beyond what the court has required them to do as far as recruiting um you know all minority groups uh  be it uh women or or minorities or you know those that they said were underrepresented or me shots  what's that me shots they're doing for me shots the little people meet me sure but why does everyone  have to be represented why they have this thing in their head that you know um they they want uh you 
[02:41:30]  know the department general to be more representative of the breakdown of the city um good luck from  left field it makes no it really makes no sense it makes no sense for the fire department because  you want the people that are going to be better best for the job when when you're in a fire and  you need someone to run up those stairs and and and uh get get to you uh and and use that training  don't you want the best guy not the most diverse group of people what the fuck does it matter if 
[02:42:00]  they're representative of the community if they're doing the job properly it's really incredible too  because the the actual questions on the test you guys are trying to look up what kind of questions  may be sort of racially biased or whatever um it's really uh you know not that you know not that  downplay but it's not a very difficult uh exam um you know the reason you have to do so well on it to  get on the job is because so many people take in the first place right a lot of reading comprehension 
[02:42:30]  stuff there's a section where they try to test your memory so they show you a photo and uh you can look at  the photo for a few you know for a minute or two without taking any notes uh-huh take a photo away  and ask you like you know how many windows are in a building or right right decisions you're going  to have to make on this on the fly huh yeah i mean if you if you're in high school you can you can  make the test i mean you know you'll need some kind of crazy background or like uh advanced degree or  anything like that to do well on this thing sam i'm pardon my interruptions sir sam has it open so 
[02:43:00]  sam are there any questions you can find there that that there's that it makes sense  that that it makes sense that it should be considered bias or that or this is at least  what they well cited and we hold on i also have a psychologist we can go to peter you're done  uh i just have one more thing the interesting thing i thought about this whole process was the group  bringing the lawsuit uh is the balkan society they're a member they're a fraternal order of um you know  black firefighters and all these guys uh took tests in the past and got on the job and they're now 
[02:43:30]  working on a job some of our officers who've been promoted multiple times and they're sitting  there with a straight face in court saying they're at this test was racist and and biased at all and  uh defeat and basically saying the people that came after them uh aren't you know good enough to  get on the job the same way they did i just thought the whole process this group that's supposed to be  looking out for the interest of black firefighters to kind of uh it's just a weird um and it's just a 
[02:44:00]  dynamic because they'll kind of say oh we'll look out for you guys because you guys couldn't do it  the way we did right right thank you sir all right let me go to harry he supposedly has a question  one of the questions harry you have one of the questions yes i do okay one of the questions um  that's on the test is um what what sport did you play in school the correct answer is basketball  because everybody's played basketball soccer's predominantly white football's predominantly black  baseball's hispanic now the proper answer is basketball because everybody plays basketball 
[02:44:30]  why would that why would that be a question you got to be joking what sport do you play i'm dead  serious i've taken the test i have three uncles and my grandfather roll off what does that have  to do with anything what sport did you play i'm guessing athleticism i may be right and wrong  though there's no right maybe maybe that's just information like to see your athleticism i play  football and soccer and baseball okay this guy's very athletic or i played golf maybe maybe that 
[02:45:00]  is it could that possibly what it's for that doesn't seem like a real question it's not a right  there's no right and wrong answers no right or wrong to it seems like no there's not but it's one of  those ridiculous things that you know everybody played basketball so you know it's one of those  things it's just it's stupid you know they're trying to prove that you know you're not right  i don't know what he's talking about either like that all right harry let me go to the psychologist  thank you i i want an actual question i don't know if that's an actual question yeah i found some of  the questions uh you did what's one of them yeah they're all but i think that they're all problems 
[02:45:30]  with like they use say one of the choices is choices is rubbish burning in a small garbage can  located on a subway platform and certain ethnicities might not know the word rubbish well that's kind  of crap that you know that's a word in english language that's that's the only we don't use the  we don't use the word yeah who does use rubbish i know what it means no one really uses that word  or it's like they're talking about a danger around a lake and it's like well what if certain 
[02:46:00]  ethnicities ethnicities didn't grow up around frozen lakes but you know what a lake is right yeah who  the fuck doesn't know what a lake is by the way if you have a fire around a lake you're just an  idiot push the fire into the lake it's right there let's go to the psychologist mark in jersey marky  hey guys i actually i'm working on my thesis i got a year left before i can say i'm a psychologist  um what i actually wanted to hit on though was if you go back to what kenny said that's that's kind  of where where the logic is because they don't use like saucer and cup when they develop tests 
[02:46:30]  the ability of somebody to to read and analyze an analogy has a lot more to do than a lot more to  do with their ability to to use logic and to to reason on a on a fundamental level that it does  like you know with the actual literal meaning right so i mean you know for whatever it's worth i'm not  sure about this test i i was in the military and i've taken the as that but i know that it wasn't heavy 
[02:47:00]  with um analogies but that's all i can think of i mean i mean you guys are taking staff in the dark  as i kind of was it says i heard about this too but these articles say that the sir the language and  situations uh give a familiarity to people who have grown up with it that allows them to better figure  out the logic behind what's going on how is it racially like if you're in the city especially  um i so far neither of those examples make sense to me right because if you grew up in a poor white 
[02:47:30]  house how often do you think they're saying rubbish if you're not british right i don't know anybody  that says rubbish i can't say that analogies are actually cultural but that's that's about it  your ability you know those develop along strict lines so right um yeah i mean that's all i got there  um okay all right let me go to west point we got kevin who took the test hi kevi you could give  some insight i guess kevin hey how you doing guys hi kevi hi uh i took the most recent one and when 
[02:48:00]  it comes to terms of the questions for the most part they gave you a video it was basically nonsense  of just a distinctive uh piece of equipment that they called a hydroverter and honestly it was just  if you could see the video and you actually listened and had basic reading comprehension you could  handle it and then as for the rest of it it was just questions about you to try and identify who  you are as a person so they could try and pull you in and be like okay as you guys were saying before 
[02:48:30]  oh this guy played football and baseball you know he's athletic he can handle you know himself going  up and down a flight of stairs and then there'd be questions that were just a morality standpoint i  feel like why do you want to join the fdny and then it would come down to oh you know  9-11 touched me in a big way or you know my family's been in it for x amount of generations  and stuff like that for the most part the exam was based on who you are as a person  it had nothing to do with racial profiling or anything like that at least in my eyes that's how 
[02:49:00]  i thought it won wow there was a big case the supreme court found bias against white firefighters in  new haven uh supreme court ruled that the white fire white firefighters were discriminated against  because uh the city threw out a promotional examination they had given on which whites had  done well and black firefighters did poorly so i guess this was like a promotional thing 
[02:49:30]  and the city rejected these test results because the higher scoring candidates i guess were  predominantly white and justice kennedy wrote that the possibility of a lawsuit for minority  firefighters oh boy was not a lawful justification for the city to throw this out because they were  afraid of being sued so all the people out there that think that why everyone it's all lawsuits that's 
[02:50:00]  why anybody does anything right yeah all right thank you kevin going to add in new york two more  here ed go ahead yeah hello i'm a new york city firefighter i spoke to somebody that's in  in with the uh the minority hiring and they said i asked them what questions weren't biased they said  the questions weren't biased but based on the answers that most minorities taking the test got  wrong that they made it clear they considered it biased because of that what's a question that most  minorities got wrong i don't know but here's one of the idiot doesn't anyone know that's what's so 
[02:50:30]  frustrating no one knows we need some kind of example no one knows here's an idiotic question that they  did ask on the test which i have no idea what could be the right answer right it said i was growing up as  a child till your age now do you consider that you have some of the same friends or you have all new  friends or none of this none of the friends how what would and what answer would be right for that you  could have moved five times in your life or whatever yeah if you're unfortunate to move around  and they were looking for the answer being you still have your same friends right and there's 
[02:51:00]  another thing if you go to a website called merit matters dot com it's an active deputy chief uh with  the fire department that says people that should be hired by their merits not by the color of their  skin and there was a police uh fire commissioner i think his last name was beekman he wrote he was a  black commissioner and he he there's a whole article about that that he said you know he loved the  civil service because you could take a test and advance due to your merits by you know how smart 
[02:51:30]  you know not by the color of your skin and he was a uh fire commissioner and a black commissioner  amazing all right if you go to merit matters dot com paul manix the deputy chief which i'm sure he'd  come on to your show okay thank you man thank you buddy let's go to philly and talk to kevin kevin  kevin hello hello team hey baby uh i have one of the questions right in front of me that is  actually uh counter experimental white people if you ask me yeah uh it says me right here uh if you 
[02:52:00]  are a witness to a fight brawl or a verbal dispute should you a break it up b call for help or c film  and yell world star see see i thought hey man you gotta give it to well played that's not legit well  played though that's not legit uh john in rockland county jesus john let's ship yeah how you doing um 
[02:52:30]  johnny yes hello hey yeah john johnny boy gotcha all right hey baby i took the test twice in uh the  80s early 80s oh you're done scored upper uh 90s and the minority got a 70s they got called before me  because it was called a popcorn effect and that's just wrong the popcorn effect what's that mean  it means that regardless of the score they had to pick so many minorities  oh how's that popcornish that's going to be so frustrated to someone that's scoring real high 
[02:53:00]  on the test yeah be the milk toots maybe they throw some water um but i messed up oh you sure did  i will never understand that when you're looking for the best person for the job and a guy has a way  higher score but he's the wrong color i will never understand that it's that simple yep all right  brother that doesn't uh that doesn't breed resentment now i think it does oh come on baby  we got one more mike on long island mike what's up mickey what's going on guys listen i'm a fine 
[02:53:30]  man to uh in the city for about 10 years the the problem with the whole test is the judge never  looked at the test the um the score he faced his decision on the disparity of scores and dcas which  is the city-wide administrative services has to follow certain parameters when the amenities pass  so they just assume they never did they just assume that if minorities scored so low so many of  them scored so low that there must be a problem with the test regardless of if they found a problem 
[02:54:00]  uh or or uh saw a question they didn't even need that they assume because so many did so poorly  that it had to be a racist well and the thing is too with this judge he was a politically appointed  uh he was actually a political point client guy he was thought to be a big level judge and he was  also a little bit of war high trouble too because about 30 years before that he was protesting against  segregation of a high school in queens so i guess his little white guilt came out and he tried to 
[02:54:30]  make himself out to be a martyr or a hero wow um let me ask you two the uh the man i remember a  thing from malcolm x from the movie so where he was talking about how these tests are biased or  whatever he said except for the math the only thing universal is the math yeah yeah so do they  score is this the case where minorities score just about as good or as good or better even on the math  and all of the reason they're failing are for these other questions like are they doing as well on 
[02:55:00]  all the things that are completely universal i don't know we don't know be nice that's a good  question though like yeah let's just say that the math questions are across the board fairly even or  within a couple of percentage points across uh-huh and then the only place that they're all shitting  the bed is in this one particular group of of questions then maybe there's something to that  well but i still want to see the question how about they show that then i agree in these new reports i agree  to go back and pay out 98 million and also you know a lot of guys losing their jobs because yeah you 
[02:55:30]  know because they have to change things up that just doesn't seem fair at all it's a lot of money  bringing it all back around uh that's your boy de blasio your boy let's go to dana in massachusetts  dana dana yellow um oh oh where is there it is hey dana what's up oh he was freaking out  uh sorry i panicked uh so this is similar to um the perceived bias that you've you've heard about 
[02:56:00]  on the sats now i've actually done quite a bit of research on this and um in fact uh anthony do you  know what the average african-american got on the sat 2011 no i don't barbecue sauce  oh and we'll be back die's been in the back i guess uh yeah just chilling bestowing stories on sal  about her days in the brewery and she's blaming the the company she worked for of course it's there 
[02:56:30]  for her mishaps oh boy she was uh like the uh kid in the candy store uh at the budweiser brewery i'm i  bet you right is that where her um she's holding her mouth her addiction kicked in i wonder if she  could get a lawsuit before that look at look i'm sue she needs chaperones she's not a lot of walk  around here by herself because of the issues we had yesterday wow like i'm just tuning in we  explained that whole thing uh early on in in the show so get the replay she's like hannibal lectern  only they put that mask over her asshole right all right can i know what happened dear what oh my
