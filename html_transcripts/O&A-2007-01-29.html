<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show, hosted by Opie, Anthony, and James Norton, with Patrice O'Neill as a studio guest, began with a raucous and profane opening, setting the tone for the entire broadcast. The hosts launched into a discussion about the misery of Mondays versus the joy of weekends, acknowledging their listeners' reliance on the show for entertainment, even if specific details of past episodes remained fuzzy.  A humorous video of David Caruso led to the creation of a catchphrase: "That's what happened. When worlds collide."

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to Donald Trump's recent disparaging remarks about the hosts in the New York Post, and their subsequent attempts to lure him back onto the program.  The hosts debated whether Trump’s negativity was genuine or a publicity stunt.

Patrice O'Neill's claim that golf isn't a sport ignited a lengthy and absurd debate, encompassing the definition of “sport” itself.  The hosts and numerous callers offered wildly different criteria, involving defense, physical contact, age restrictions, and even the potential for death.  Chess, bowling, NASCAR, skiing, and swimming all entered the fray, with the hosts suggesting ludicrous modifications to make golf and bowling into sports (e.g., adding midgets as defensive players in bowling). The debate remained unresolved by the show's conclusion.

A lengthy and provocative discussion about whether swimming is a sport followed, fueled by a caller's argument that it lacked the inter-competitor element of team sports.  The hosts and Patrice O'Neill suggested increasingly outlandish ways to make swimming a "sport" (introducing sharks, octopuses, or opponent-controlled currents). This segment included racially charged and offensive comments about the athletic abilities of different racial groups.  The discussion broadened to include skiing, golf, and track and field, all examined through the same distorted lens of competitive interaction. The criteria for what constitutes a “sport” became increasingly subjective and humorous, with suggestions like blindside tackles in golf and wave machines operated by opponents in swimming.

The show then delved into highly offensive and sexist comments about Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's presidential candidacies, speculating on the influence of race and gender on voter preferences. This section contained crude and misogynistic remarks about women in politics.  Audio clips from "Crip Slam Sundays," featuring performances by people with disabilities, were played, followed by a discussion of "No Filter Paul's" media pranks, which included assaults on news crews. The hosts acknowledged the offensiveness of some of this content.

A segment on "deaf karaoke" followed, prompted by a caller's anecdote about a deaf rapper.  The hosts and callers brainstormed absurd karaoke variations (Novocaine karaoke, "chubby bunny karaoke"),  and attempted to identify a mystery song played by a deaf person on YouTube, receiving numerous incorrect guesses.  The discussion expanded to encompass the biggest inventions in human history (flight vs. computers) and planned obsolescence.  A live feed of an interview with American Idol's Sarah Goldberg (known for a meltdown) was also featured, with the hosts offering commentary.  The hosts also briefly mentioned an upcoming "Your Vaginas Got Talent" segment.

The show moved on to a discussion of "leet speak," online teen slang, and parental concerns.  This transitioned into listener calls about unusual vaginal feats involving various objects (coins, ping pong balls, bananas, a toothbrush), leading to a brainstorming session for "Your Vaginas Got Talent," featuring vagina-based competitive events.  The conversation veered into a discussion of unusual and offensive food items (tiger taint, squirrel, monkey balls, etc.), with callers suggesting increasingly bizarre culinary options.  Calls about cyberbullying and unusual sexual acts performed by a college girlfriend were also included.

A significant portion featured Tyra Banks confronting a World of Warcraft-addicted caller whose husband’s gaming addiction was causing marital problems, exacerbated by her post-childbirth weight gain. The hosts and Patrice engaged in a highly sexually charged and vulgar discussion about male perspectives on post-marriage weight gain, male infidelity, and relationships, using misogynistic and homophobic slurs.  The discussion included suggestions for resolving the addiction, ranging from the wife losing weight to the husband destroying his game discs.  A caller provided an update on the husband's in-game character's level, while the hosts and Patrice offered crude relationship advice.  A tangential discussion about SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) occurred, followed by a humorous bit involving Patrice's upcoming show. The segment concluded with announcements about a Hot Movies video contest and mentions of Bodogfight.com.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  If this doesn't make you want to throw up a failure, it's the most annoying thing on two legs.  What a whore fest.  Who cares about the funny? Just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb? See he's...  Opie, Opie, do you want to play?  Anthony, I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton.  I'm dancing, I'm dancing, I'm just, I'm a naked whore. 
[00:00:30]  It's indescribable, I'm trying.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance.  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for.  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him, but with Jimmy, you never know, it could be AIDS.  No.  Yes, yes.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. today.  And...  I hate you.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  We love the dramatic open there, Patrice. 
[00:01:30]  We're going to get things done today.  Good morning, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America on this fine Monday.  Yeah.  They're great, aren't they?  Get up.  You think there's one person out there that's so excited that it's Monday?  Yeah, it's time to get back to my cubicle.  I can't wait to see the work gang.  All excited. 
[00:02:00]  Some jerk asks you how your family is and they don't even know you that well.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  How's the family?  What'd you do this weekend?  Let me tell you what I did.  I didn't ask.  Why does Monday suck so bad?  Because your weekends are usually like the highlight of your life, you know?  You get two days out of seven that you can have fun and do whatever you want and nobody,  you're not obligated to do anything, really.  You do what you want. 
[00:02:30]  But is it also because you're just tired from the weekend?  Yeah, that's another thing.  So like your mental state's a little like, ugh.  That's why you're annoying the crap out of me.  I'm so happy to do, like I'm a part of the weekend sometimes when you just watch people  and you go, wow, you need me to get through.  Like there's some people that if they don't go out Friday, they're like, oh my God, we  didn't go out Friday.  We have to go out Saturday.  I love staying in the house on Friday.  Friday, yeah.  It's just beautiful.  But they go crazy on Friday and Saturday and then Sunday they're trying to get everything 
[00:03:00]  done, the laundry, the this and that, and here comes old Funky Monday.  Uh-oh.  Sounds like somebody's got a case of the Mondays.  The Mondays.  Shut up.  So that's why you guys are so important on a good Monday morning.  Yeah.  They look to you to, that's another thing about entertainment, man.  Bring it all around.  You know, you watch shows, you have your favorite shows, and sometimes, you know, I'll have a  bad comedy show, you know, and I'll go, ah, I'll just do it again. 
[00:03:30]  But you forget there's people there that just depend on you.  And there's no show I watch that would suck, that I would go, you know, ah, they'll give  it to me better next time.  You know, watch around the horn.  I expect good things from PTI every day.  You better be funny, fellas.  Never like, oh, forget it.  Patrice definitely makes a good point because drove out to FH Riley's after Friday's show.  Yeah.  Listening to the replay on XM, laughing my ass off. 
[00:04:00]  I rarely listen to our show after it's done.  It's done, time to move on, don't want to hear about it for the most part.  But every once in a while, I'll take a little listen, a little peek.  And I was enjoying the hell out of the show we put on Friday.  And I'm thinking to myself, no one's going to give a crap by Monday.  They need you.  Now we're here Monday.  They don't even, we could go to the phones, talk to faithful listeners and go, what did  we do on Friday's show?  They don't even know anymore.  A lot of them will say it was good.  A lot of them will say it was entertaining.  I laughed and all that crap.  But if you ask for specific, excuse me, they would be like, ah, that thing, ah, it would 
[00:04:30]  be very vague.  Right now, there was a dude at 5.59 Eastern Standard Time just with his hand on the steering  wheel waiting to go.  He probably starts his car right when he goes, I love with that pull ever.  And just, yeah, just so he doesn't miss a word.  Because you know how your radio goes off for three seconds when you started and he's just  like, he's driving and he's just waiting. 
[00:05:00]  And he's just like, please let something happen good for me before I go to my job.  And we could just be like, I know sometimes there's people that just, I was in Providence  this weekend and I know I made a few fans and I lost a few.  Like, it's just some people that are just so excited to see.  And I'm miserable.  So it's like, I love you, Patrice, and it's like, look, look, what do you know me from?  We love web junk.  Let me come down there and smack you right upside your head.  Because I don't love web junk anymore. 
[00:05:30]  I don't like this guy.  But then there's another guy going, wait, he's funnier than web junk.  Don't mention web junk to Patrice anymore.  Especially after they made him into a monster.  Ah, next to Jim Brewer.  Ah.  Made my eyes all big like Rache Codwell.  I don't know what the hell.  Jim Brewer took over for you.  He's doing a great job.  But they, end of year special, had to have Patrice in there like, ah, as a monster.  And make him believe he was right next to Jim Brewer live. 
[00:06:00]  On a green screen.  But it was old footage.  It was a green screen of Patrice just laughing and moving his arms.  It was a green screen raping.  I was like, what?  What just happened?  A couple of dollars?  That might be a little too inside for people.  But that made me laugh so hard.  Because Brewer's live.  He's taping.  He's in the moment and then all of a sudden Brewer goes, and we got Patrice.  And all of a sudden you pop up on the screen.  But there's, it's obviously old footage that they're trying to make it look like, you know,  you're right there with them in the moment.  But that's why.  God, did that make me laugh. 
[00:06:30]  That's why I left talking about what we were just talking about.  That's why I left.  Because it's like, I just didn't, I didn't have any more to give people the show they wanted.  By this time, I would have been like, hey, look at this Japanese guy.  I kicked this other guy in his scrotum.  Dig it.  It would have been jazz junk.  Oh, yeah.  If you look at this young man dressed as a ninja turtle.  Yeah.  He bites this other guy.  Take a good look at this baby.  Anyway, it's Monday.  Could you play that clip again? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Uh-oh.  Sounds like somebody's got a case of the Moondays.  Oh, my God.  Opie, by the way.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  By the way.  What happened?  Me and, you know, Gavin.  Big Gavin.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Our new thing now because of.  Gavin, you got to explain for everybody.  We got new audiences all the time.  Oh, that's right.  You got right.  He's from across the pond.  He's like, these are mice. 
[00:07:30]  He's all from Birmingham.  You know you yikes.  He's as big as any house you've ever seen.  He's the scariest looking dude.  He fills up a doorway is the easiest way to explain Gavin, but he's so polite and nice  with that nice little English voice.  With his glasses and he fixes them and his big bald head, but he's a nice guy.  He's the type of guy that would rip your head off your body, but he would be very nice  about it.  Horrible, like horrifying dude, but the nicest guy.  You know, one of my best friends.  Yeah, yeah.  So we, our new thing is, uh, I showed him that, uh, David Caruso thing.  Oh, the CSI thing? 
[00:08:00]  Oh, man.  And our new thing now is just to go, anytime somebody's talking, just to go, that's what  happened.  When worlds collide.  When worlds collide.  We just go, what did he do?  He's just like telling you something.  Well, after somebody tells you a long story, well, that's what happens.  When worlds collide.  I like that.  I like that.  That's how I got, that's how I got no thing now, walking around.  I'm stealing that one.  Oh, it's hilarious, man.  Well, Frank, that's what happens when worlds collide. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, don't worry.  We'll have the David Caruso line of the day in a little while here.  So I cannot, when I'm going around the channels there, the guide, and I see a CSI Miami, I'm  like, dog, Jesus.  And I look, and if it's like 10 o'clock, it comes on, but it's 10.05, I won't even turn  it in.  Damn.  I just got to catch that opening sequence.  That's all I want to say.  You think after this that the rate, like, I don't know how Nielsen ratings go, but you 
[00:09:00]  think if you're watching it, if everybody's just watching it at 10, that that's the ratings.  And after you see them go, worlds collide.  Collide.  Is that the ratings?  That's Exodus.  They could see that for the first five minutes, it's packed.  But does it matter if you turn?  Well, ever since the video hit YouTube, I'm sure everyone's just watching for that first  scene.  Yeah, the opener.  Right up until you hear. 
[00:09:30]  And they show the frigging swamp boats and everything else, it's over.  It's Evo.  The credits.  That's the credit, right.  The beginning credits.  Hey, let's go to Ryan the trucker.  Ryan, what's going on?  Not much, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, Ryan.  Hey, whatever happened between you guys and the Donald?  Uh, Donald, uh, Trump turned on us, called us two slobs in, uh, the New York Post last  week.  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember that.  What a, what a, what a douche.  And then we said, and then we've been calling him, uh, like crazy. 
[00:10:00]  We had Roland calling him like crazy, his office, to just get him on our show and let's, uh,  let's talk this out.  If you hate us, then tell us to our face you hate us.  Come on the show.  What'd you guys do?  We didn't do anything.  We really didn't do anything on this one.  We were good boys.  He, he called up during the whole Rosie O'Donnell thing.  And, uh, we said, wow, uh, you know, Donald's on the phone.  We talked about, we had a really good time.  And then we, uh, we sent the audio to, you know, a few media outlets they picked up on. 
[00:10:30]  And some of the things he said on our show were, uh, we're printed up in the papers and  in some of those, uh, uh, trash magazines.  So Richard Douchebag Johnson from, uh, uh, the Post, right?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  He was in, he, uh, wrote, uh, that we were begging Donald to come on and, uh, said that  it was a surprise.  And Donald said, I, I wouldn't just call them.  They called me and, and they're, uh, uh, slobs.  I wouldn't, why, why would I go on a slob show like that? 
[00:11:00]  By the way, Larry King and by the way, he did call us whether he was asked to call that  day or not.  I don't even know, to be honest with you.  We kind of have a relationship with a lot of these celebrities where they just call when  they have something.  Yeah.  So yeah, he goes, I get, you know, everybody wanted me.  I turned down Larry King and he basically said he'll never do the, uh, our show again.  Those two slobs.  I'll never do those two slob show.  Cause he's a dick.  He really is.  I don't know where he just was like, yeah. 
[00:11:30]  Out of nowhere.  He just like turned.  Yeah.  It wasn't justified.  We, uh, I guess that's the game.  Cause Barbara Walters got pushing the coin.  She, they, evidently they were friends until he starts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was, you know, I was siding with Donald because, uh, Rosie O'Donnell gave him some  crap first on the show and he fired back like a mad man.  Uh, and I was kind of siding with him thinking, ah, that's kind of cool.  I think you should still, I think you should still side with him.  I think people, there are people that like me and I don't like.  And, uh, I think that if you sided with him then just because he's an enemy now, I think 
[00:12:00]  you should still side with him.  Just take that kind of thing.  Like, yeah, Donald still like agree with what he's saying.  And yeah, well, we knew it would end.  I'm not built like that.  No, no, we knew it would end in, in a way like this.  We knew we were like making a, you know, a deal with the devil.  He's a Howard Stern guy to begin with, but he needs our show because Howard doesn't bring  in the numbers he used to.  And he would, he's got products and things to promote.  So he decided to start calling us.  We, we got along very, very good. 
[00:12:30]  Very well.  I should say very well.  And then out of nowhere, he, uh, he bashes us in the New York post.  What can I tell you?  Well, you know, we're not hiding.  We're like, we're here.  He knows we're here.  We, we called his people.  We said, have Donald call us.  Let's talk this out a little bit on our show.  Yep.  And if it means that, you know, he's going to curse us out and do it to our faces.  But, uh, apparently I've never seen him do that.  Like that whole thing with Rosie O'Donnell.  It was never a face to face confrontation.  Right.  Well, you know, we're trying, we'll try again today to get Donald Trump on the phone. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Give it a whirl.  And trust me, we don't need Donald Trump to have a successful.  Because he was kind of, he was kind of alluding to, you know, that as well.  It's like, uh, please.  You're just one of many people that we've had on this radio show that, that do well.  He did well for us.  We had some fun with him, but he's not going to make or break the Opie and Anthony.  Let's be honest here.  The guy was on, it was mostly a Donald Trump plug fest.  Uh, we made the best of it, uh, through what we do by making him interesting, uh, to talk 
[00:13:30]  to by goofing on a lot of stuff.  But the bottom line is he just wanted to call and get his either learning annex or another  buildings going up, or he's marrying some other frigging 16 year old girl, or, or he's  got his Miss Universe contest going.  It's never just, you know, hi, how are you doing guys?  Let me hang out and goof around with you.  Let's be real.  The guy's a douchebag.  We had him on the, on the show.  Oh, I almost went into XM mode.  This is just evil. 
[00:14:00]  Cause it's like, it's like, at first it was like, why he's going, why, wait, why he's  on?  It's like, yeah, dude, you're coming into my learning annex, you know, and that thing.  And it's like, and it's like, Donald, you're a great guy.  And then it's like, I think he goes, eh, he's promoting that wacky learning annex garbage.  That stupid, anyone can be rich bull crap that he goes on.  Let me tell you how you two can be rich.  Really, Donald?  Inherit all the money from, uh, your family.  And then you, uh, build a bunch of things in the city at the perfect time. 
[00:14:30]  Right.  It's like, it's like going to one of your casinos and rolling the dice.  Right.  You, Joe Schmo, can build a building in Manhattan.  Yeah.  Imagine Joe Schmo actually attempting that.  Attempting.  Look at the skyscrapers.  And it's Joe Schmo building construction is going to go up.  Next thing you know.  And it's just Joe and his friends with some I-beams.  Right.  And you're going to be the next Donald Trump.  There are some unknown areas in Manhattan that you can build on.  Right.  But hold on.  Why not?  Next thing you know, you're pissed off the wrong person.  You got cement shoes and you're floating to the bottom of a river somewhere. 
[00:15:00]  You're taking that boat ride out.  It's not even, it's not even when you do have the shoes and you're in the water.  It's the boat ride out.  So that's got to be the uncomfortable part where it's like, oh, what did I do?  I just tried to be like Donald.  I learned at the learning annex.  And now organized crime guys are frigging chopping my head off.  And you're already going, all right, as soon as they throw me in, I'm going to take one big breath in.  And I hope drowning is easy.  But you know basic human survival instinct, you'd hold your breath. 
[00:15:30]  You just go, you try to remove those, you go like, please, ghost of Houdini, get me out of here.  How can I get out of cement?  And the cement is just bringing you down at an unreasonable rate.  Your ears are popping.  You've never sunk so fast in your life.  You look at the surface and you still got hope.  Maybe there's something going to, nah.  Maybe this is just a gag.  They're going to pull me back up.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  Maybe this is how they're doing my surprise birthday party. 
[00:16:00]  They're going to pull me up and it's going to be a book filled with my friends and family.  There's a tank down there and Ashton Kutcher will come out and I've been punked.  He's in a scuba suit.  Yeah, he'll give me some air.  It's got to be anything but, oh, my God, I've just been killed by organized crime for building something where I shouldn't have.  Some skeleton down there with a surprise look on his face like, I thought I was going to make it too.  Some frigging accountant corpse just waving back and forth in the current. 
[00:16:30]  And his skeleton arm is like, and you're looking at him like, I'm the next skeleton.  So, uh.  And you're screaming.  You're screaming like the photographer in Jaws 2.  Trying to remove your cement shit. 
[00:17:00]  Just trying your damnedest.  Because you know you got about, I don't know, 15 seconds to do it in.  You're hoping for an old Popeye fist out of nowhere.  Maybe there'll be a lump hammer down at the bottom.  Maybe I'll get lucky and land on a frigging little sledge.  Oh, my goodness.  Could you imagine?  No.  That all of a sudden you do land right next to some tools.  It's like, oh, here's some tools.  Wow.  But, you know, everything just swings in slow motion down there. 
[00:17:30]  So you can't even get a good swing on it.  Not even a powerful.  You got all the tools you need to get out of the cement, but you're swinging in slow-mo.  You got a chisel and a hammer and everything.  You're hoping to be like, you just go.  There are some magical things you hope.  You ever see Creepshow when Ted Danson's going, I'm going to get you, dude.  I'm going to get you.  To Leslie Nielsen.  Yeah, yeah.  And then he comes back as a zombie.  Yeah.  It's revenge.  Can't even shoot him.  And you're not going to do that.  You're just going to be a dumb dead man at the bottom of the hunt.  I can hold my breath for a long time. 
[00:18:00]  That was a horrible one.  He buried Ted Danson and his wife, who Ted Danson was cheating on, up to their necks  in the sand by the beach, at the beach.  And it was during low tide.  So as the tide came in, it's getting higher and higher up on him.  And then you just see him completely in the water going, with the seaweed next to him.  Oh, that's great.  Hey, that's one of my favorite movies.  Just tell her to call you Billy. 
[00:18:30]  He takes Adrian Barbeau in with the monster and has it rip her apart.  I haven't seen it in many years.  I remember.  It's 81, but it's hysterical.  I remember the scene that Anthony's talking about.  I don't remember the.  He has fantasies.  They're at a little dinner party and people are talking.  She's just like, ah, you're a waste.  What a piece of garbage you are.  And he pulls a gun out and just shoots her right between the eyes.  And everyone in the crowd goes, nice shot.  Nice shot.  And he comes out of his fantasy and she's just like, 
[00:19:00]  what would you do without me?  That bitch.  So he has some frigging Yeti eater up that they found in a box under the stairs.  All right.  We got to step aside.  Listen.  So Donald Trump, whatever.  Well, we are a Trump douchebag.  That's what I say.  But we're calling his people.  At least call us and tell us to our face what the problem is.  That ain't going to happen.  Well, fine.  But, you know, we're not hiding.  We're here.  He knows where we are.  And he knows that our people are calling his people.  He should run the wussy annex. 
[00:19:30]  Come on.  Call us.  Everyone's going to get rich.  Just go to my annex and pay me money.  That's how you get rich.  I'm going to put on a learning annex.  You, too, can be rich.  All right.  When we get back, first of all, Patrice O'Neill in studio today.  You promoting anything, Patrice?  Black Phillip, February 3rd on XM.  Oh.  This Saturday on XM.  Yes, sir.  Very good.  This Saturday night on XM.  After the razzle dazzle.  When we get back, Patrice walked into our office, nice and early. 
[00:20:00]  Doesn't say hello.  He just said, what did you say?  Golf is not a sport.  Golf is not a sport.  Yep.  We're going to explore that next.  I completely agreed, too, when he was done.  How about that?  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Great point.  Unprecedented.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A, uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.

Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  Talking about being tired this morning.  What's up?  And Patrice isn't really tired because he slept three hours before the show today.  I usually never sleep before I come in. 
[00:21:00]  And I just think that's amazing.  And I asked him, I go, do you even see the sun?  Hell no.  And he said, what was your...  I might get guilty at three in the afternoon.  Yeah, yeah.  But like, you know, the morning sun.  And the birds is chirping.  And it's like, what a wonder.  Open the curtain and you take a sniff of air.  Yeah.  I hate the sun.  That fresh morning air.  You know why I love bad weather?  Because I don't have to like...  Like, then it's like, good. 
[00:21:30]  Everybody else is in the house.  I don't feel like a freak.  When it's sunny out, I go, oh boy, I got to love life.  Now some reason I got to be out.  Give me a horrible storm.  I got to go outside for some reason.  So I can feel good about myself that I'm doing the right thing.  Yeah, because you're fine during the whole day when it's sunny out.  Because there's always this possibility.  You go, I might go out.  I might do something.  But then when like 4.30, 5 rolls around, you're like...  Sun's going down.  The pressure's off. 
[00:22:00]  I wasted the whole day.  But you're happy.  No, you get a little guilt first.  Do you?  A little guilt that you didn't go out.  But then you're kind of happy that, you know, it's done.  But like Patrice said, bad weather.  That's huge.  Then you look outside and go, no reason to go out there.  I love rain and snow.  I love miserable weather.  That sun, I've never seen the sun come over anything.  No.  Like it's dark now and I'm very happy.  At about 8, I'm like...  Around 8, you're going to get depressed.  And you see all these people who are up.  And you just go... 
[00:22:30]  There's nothing worse than being in traffic with just people who have to be in traffic.  Have to be up.  Yeah.  I love...  I bought some blinds from one of these, you know, the Home Depot type place.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's...  From the U.S. military, the ones that shut when the atomic bomb goes off.  Close the blast doors.  I am.  There's aluminum foil.  There's some space material built inside the folds so that when you put them down, it's lightless blinds. 
[00:23:00]  Lightless.  Oh, is that great?  There's a little sliver of light that comes through that I get mad at.  I want my...  I'm really like Nosferatu when I'm...  I have no respect for the sun.  Me and my girl go into a hotel when we do road trips and stuff like that in the hotel.  And there is...  I'm in a city where there is no reason to leave, to go outside.  I lose track of everything.  I don't know what time it is, what day it is, anything.  We pull those two plastic little rods...  Oh, the hotel curtain sticks. 
[00:23:30]  The hotel curtain sticks.  Wham them together.  And then that's not even enough.  You got to make sure...  Because, you know, you got the little wavy folds in the curtain.  You got to make sure...  Those points of light that you don't want.  They overlap.  And then I get hangers out of the closet that clip like for pants.  So they got the clips.  And I clipped the whole thing shut.  So nothing gets through.  Nothing gets through.  Wow, you're a sun guy?  I know you're enjoying this.  Oh, he's one of those like 6 a.m. 
[00:24:00]  You just hear the curtains go...  I'm not a 4 in the morning guy.  No one is.  But 7, no problem.  7, no problem.  When we had...  Opie holds his finger up and a bird just...  Best time of the day, though, because no one's around.  Less asses.  What's that?  In the morning?  Yeah.  When we were off for two years, I was getting up early, enjoying the day.  Again, you got people that have to be up, so they're kind of miserable.  Yeah.  Saturday, I was playing a little poker over Pest's house. 
[00:24:30]  Had a great time.  But that thing didn't end until 6 in the morning.  You went up...  What?  What happened?  Played a little Texas Hold'em with some of the Pest from the show.  Yeah, I actually interacted with human beings.  He interacts with human beings?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very rare.  Look at Patrice looking around.  It's very rare.  But occasionally, I do get out of the house.  You hung out with people?  Hung out with people.  You talk to them?  Fans of the show.  Yeah.  Fans of the show?  A lot of pal talk people.  You talk to them?  Yeah.  Yeah, he does.  Played poker.  The Club Soda went with you?  Took their money. 
[00:25:00]  No, no.  No Club Soda.  No.  He's with Jimmy.  You and Jimmy?  No.  No.  Club Soda is with Jimmy.  He's with Jimmy.  Oh, with Jimmy.  Yeah.  But you went by yourself.  Yeah, me and my girl went.  Hung out.  Played poker.  That's it.  I'm impressed.  I'm impressed.  Oh, Patrice, we do do, like, regular things.  Occasionally.  If it involves...  Patrice is looking at us like, what?  See, if it involves poker, then I'll do it.  I went a couple weeks ago down to Jersey to Kevin Smith's store that he's got down there, 
[00:25:30]  his comic book store, because he has a poker game.  So I drove, like, an hour and a half, hung out, real people.  And what happened when people were like, hey, man, hey, man, what's going on, man?  Hey, man, what's it like?  Hey, how's Hope?  I just sit there and go, I'm playing cards.  Yeah, leave me alone.  Nah, I do talk.  He socializes.  Yeah, when somebody makes you so sorry, you don't go, warning, malfunction.  Warning, warning, someone is talking to me.  Leave the environment immediately. 
[00:26:00]  Leave.  Wow, that's a great damn must.  I didn't realize you talked to people.  It was six in the morning, though, when I was leaving, and it was that blue, that, like,  blue color that happens in the morning.  It's just starting to get...  It's just starting.  It's warming up.  And everything's blue out.  And I'm like, I've got to get home.  Why did I stay out so late?  Get home.  Driving that Viper or whatever you drive that Viper.  That's the Escalade.  All right, listen, let's get into this for a minute or two here. 
[00:26:30]  Bill from Waterford on the Instant Feedback.  Patrice, how is golf not a sport?  You compete against other players, and there are no judges involved.  No, you don't compete.  You physically exert yourself, and you need skill to hit the ball into the hole in the  fewest amount of shots.  That's Bill.  He'll explain it.  Bill, I...  Bill, I...  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Bill's stupid.  You get Smokezilla from Wackbag.  Any event that you can participate in and be eligible to draw a Social Security check  should not be a sport.  Good call, Patrice.  Golf is not a...  I was sitting there, and I've been listening to this argument that the sports guys have 
[00:27:00]  been having lately are trying to figure out who's more dominating at a sport than Tiger  Woods.  Is it right now?  Is it Roger Federer?  Tennis dude, right.  Or was Michael Jordan the most dominant per...  Golf is not a sport.  I'm going to make it very simple, my argument.  It is not allowed to be a sport unless there's defense.  That really sums it up. 
[00:27:30]  Golf...  And that includes other sports, man.  I'm not saying it's not skill, but you have a very good skill that, thank God, your hobby  can make you money.  Your hobby.  Tiger Woods is the greatest hobbyist that ever played because it'll be a sport if somebody  was actually coming out to try to prevent you from using your skill.  You know, you make a good point.  You understand what I'm saying?  I grew up as a basketball player, and if there was no defense, I probably would have been 
[00:28:00]  the greatest NBA shooter of all time.  How could they...  Of all time.  If...  Listen, golf is a mental game.  Tiger is mentally better.  He might be physically better, which gives him advantages to getting it further.  He works out.  I'm not saying it's not a skill, but it's not a sport because...  Can somebody stand there and go, hey, Woodsy, hey, half-cheeky black dude, what the hell?  What you doing?  Tiger sucks. 
[00:28:30]  Boom, boom.  As soon as you do that...  You get thrown out.  Yeah, as soon as you do that, they throw you out.  Sure.  You have to...  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  What would make it a sport, then?  If somebody came out and tried to...  Tackle him?  Tried to...  Okay, ready?  A guy was at the top of the hill.  It was 10 seconds, right?  Tiger...  Because you can take all the time you want to figure out your putt.  Oh, yeah.  You get 15 seconds to hit the ball, and you go, all right, 15 seconds, click.  Now, you got a guy 15 seconds away that gets to run at you as fast as he can, and you 
[00:29:00]  have to concentrate and hit the ball in the little hole as this dude comes...  And once you hit the ball, he can't hit you.  Oh, okay.  But if you're still doing the size up, and he's near you, you can bash him right in his  face.  Then it's a sport.  Bicycling?  Not a sport.  Skiing?  No, wait, wait.  Not a sport.  They said bicycling sport in the offense.  Oh, you did make a good point for that.  Because they run in teams, so some of them block, and there is a competition between people, 
[00:29:30]  so it's competitive in that way.  If it's defense involved.  There's defense involved, because they do kind of run block for each other.  Ping pong is more of a sport than golf.  Because you have a guy that is trying to keep you from making your shots.  Bowling?  Bowling.  If you had midgets holding the pins...  And they can lift them up.  And you can lift them up.  If you had to learn...  How about a midget goalie? 
[00:30:00]  I mean, midgets lifting up the pins, that's just silly.  You got to hook that ball around them?  Just midget goalie in front.  To make it real.  Yeah.  Yes.  You know what?  You're right, Ope.  I'm not even going to exaggerate this.  You can't exaggerate it.  We're going to figure out how to make bowling and golf a sport.  It's add some type of realistic defense.  I got an idea.  Well, with golf, what about landmines?  That's dangerous.  Well, that's not realistic.  That's death.  I got an idea with bowling. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, yeah.  You don't want to die when you're doing a hobby.  That's when I make a puzzle.  That's when I make a puzzle.  That's when I make a puzzle.  Go ahead.  Involves a midget.  I'm bowling.  And this is legit.  It could actually work.  Okay.  You have a red zone.  A little square box that the midget must stay in.  In the middle of the lane.  Now, in order to get a strike, you really got to be good and hook it.  The skill level.  You got to do that.  You can't just sit there and roll straight.  Hold on.  But what about.  You can't just roll.  You know how we bowl. 
[00:31:00]  This is legitimate.  Wait, the midget can't dive to the side?  No, no, no.  No, he's got to stay in the box.  You can always stop, but it teaches you.  But it's not really defense.  No, it is defense.  It is.  You can't pull that.  You can't pull that away.  Well, wait.  Hockey.  Wait a second.  There has to be some kind of interaction.  You can't.  There are.  Okay.  Hockey.  Yeah.  Because the puck is so small, though.  But the goalie has a workable space.  Right.  To do.  To do.  Now, if you can get the ball past the midget in that zone. 
[00:31:30]  In the zone.  No, I say he gets the whole lane.  No.  Back and forth.  Then let me tell you something.  You're never getting a pin.  Back and forth, not front to back.  Okay.  You know what you do then?  Wind the bowling alley to two sides.  Yeah.  You widen the.  You now double the size.  All right.  And maybe you chain the midget.  Dude, you need the midget zone.  Because there's no way he could.  He sees it coming.  He kicks it into the gutter every time. 
[00:32:00]  But as soon as you figure out that shot.  There's not one guy that could get you around.  As soon as you figure out that shot where it curves over and he can't touch it, then he's not even playing defense anymore.  There's nothing he can do.  Let me tell you something.  That's where the guy becomes an athlete and a competitor in a sport.  You now bowling.  He just masters that one shot.  And then there's no defense.  Sometimes they don't.  Sometimes they got to hook it and it doesn't quite hook like they want as close to the gutter.  Opie, how can you have a skill where your practice doesn't involve competing against someone else to stop you from having your skill? 
[00:32:30]  Where your personal ability is the only thing you're going against.  Your score is the only thing you're going against.  Gymnastics, not a sport.  Because no one is trying to prevent.  But now football, you have the – even basketball, which I think is the – maybe other than baseball, maybe hitting a small object at $100,000. 
[00:33:00]  Does basketball really have defense?  I mean, let's be honest.  But I'm saying here's the thing about basketball that makes it very difficult.  It's almost as if you were juggling and a guy was trying to take your juggle things out of your hand.  So you had to juggle and back up and move while you're juggling.  That's what dribbling a basketball is.  So if you're dribbling a basketball is reverse juggling, a guy is trying to stop you from juggling.  Can you imagine – do you understand what I'm saying? 
[00:33:30]  So my thing is I'm not saying – that's why I believe Roger Federer is a better athlete or he's more dominant in his thing than Tiger Woods.  I'm not saying Tiger doesn't have a great skill.  But it's not a sport.  Not a sport.  And I will now look at what they call sports a little differently.  Well, how do you make golf more interesting? 
[00:34:00]  We got the vision in the ball.  You add a 15-second –  Yeah.  I can stop you.  Can you add animals?  Well, no.  Like crazy dogs that might run on the course and just grab your ball and run.  You can add distraction.  Yeah.  You can add – you can add – like they're showing the Knicks game.  Some dude, some seven-foot monster is trying to keep you from putting a ball in a small hole.  Now, if somebody was trying to prevent Tiger from putting that ball in a small hole, it is now a sport. 
[00:34:30]  Simple as that.  Skiing is not a sport.  Swimming is not a sport.  How is skiing not a sport?  Because it's a skill.  What do you want?  Linebackers on the side of the hill?  When you're going downhill skiing, the guy should be able to bump you like football.  Bump you off your route.  But if you just can just ski down a hill as fast as you can, which I'm not disrespecting what it takes to learn that. 
[00:35:00]  No, it's amazing.  But it's not a sport.  It's a very physical hobby.  I like how he just writes it off as a hobby.  It's a hobby.  It's like building models.  Physical hobby.  Let's go to Don in Jersey.  Don, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  How you guys doing?  Good.  All right.  Just calling in to tell Patrice, there is a defense in golf.  It's Mother Nature. 
[00:35:30]  Some days she gets mad and she gets Tiger's balls all wet.  And some days she blows his balls all wet.  Let me tell you why that's not true.  They can choose to cut down every tree and build domes.  You can play golf in a giant dome.  If you have to.  Yeah, stop.  No.  And when they have lightning in the area, they shut down the game anyway.  It's not a sport.  They should make you.  How about if they make you play lightning?  Does that make golf a sport?  No, because you can't depend on Mother Nature.  That's just dumb.  Just doing some things out there.  And look at that. 
[00:36:00]  And then that makes football.  If that makes golf a sport, it makes football a quadruple-duple-duple sport.  Because football, not only do you deal with someone trying to punch your face off, but you also deal with the snow.  You deal with frostbite.  All right, let's say hi to Mike in Cleveland.  Mike, what's up?  You know what else might make it a sport?  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  You know what else might make it a sport?  They all tee off at the same time and the first person to get the ball in the hole.  So now they're competing against each other.  Only if, only, I'll tell you why.  Hey, he's on to something. 
[00:36:30]  No, no, no.  No.  I'm going to tell you why.  Okay.  I believe in this.  And it's not even, it doesn't matter about your total score.  It's how many shots per hole.  Ready?  You win that hole, you get a point.  Curling is more of a sport than golf.  It's curling.  The thing where the guy takes the broom.  Right.  He sweeps because he can knock your, he can remove your skill.  Even though at the time you're doing your thing, there's no opponents.  To stop you. 
[00:37:00]  To stop you.  But there's something to prevent you from having your skill.  All right.  You got a hole in your theory here because Bert and Philly writes, okay, so the following  are sports according to Patrice.  Pictionary, Monopoly, curling, chess, checkers, and foosball.  No.  No.  Mm-mm.  Ready?  Okay.  He thinks I thought of this.  All right.  All right.  Ass.  Chess is, ready?  Chess is your skill versus my skill.  Right?  But your skill doesn't necessarily prevent my skill from happening. 
[00:37:30]  It's your skill is better.  Golf, it's my skill versus your skill.  Mm-hmm.  But if I could take, at one point, if I can make a decision other than my skill to take  your king off the board and just throw it, then it's a sport.  If I can smash your face into your pieces.  Right.  Right?  Yeah.  Then it's a sport.  Arm wrestling.  No one would ever win.  Arm wrestling is a sport. 
[00:38:00]  But no one would collide.  I'm because there's your arm versus my arm.  Right.  And I am trying to bring those.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  All right.  I get that.  But who wins in chess if you have that little move you could do?  No one would ever win.  I think you have to say that in a sport.  If I was bigger and faster and I know how to play chess.  See, Tiger might still be a great golfer if, because, okay, say physicality was brought  into golf.  Yeah.  Tiger's faster, younger than, say, Fuzzy Zella or whatever. 
[00:38:30]  He punches Fuzzy Zella in the stomach and then golfs.  Right.  So it's not Tiger's fault that he is more of a physical specimen than Fuzzy Zella or somebody.  But the fact is, there's no sport, and let's add something else, defense and age.  There's no sport where a 20-year-old can compete with a 60-year-old.  True.  None.  You don't even have to sell me on this.  And the chess thing, I got that figured out, how to make chess a sport.  Yeah.  Without any physical contact or flicking the various things. 
[00:39:00]  Spiders?  Beforehand.  Any type of spiders.  Spiders walking around the board, then you take the chance to move your piece around?  You can't have animals or spiders.  I want animals in my sports.  It's got to be competition between people.  Here it is.  The chess boards are totally changed now in professional chess.  Here's how they work.  Each little square, you sit there with a little keyboard that the other guy can't see, and  you can program up to a certain amount of squares that at any time you want, they just 
[00:39:30]  go boing and pop a frigging thing up.  Now, you sit there, and you can do it when there's a pawn on there, if that is what you  want to do, or wait and see if a better piece gets on there.  And then boing.  Someone else directly affects your strategy.  So then, no matter how good your skill is, if all of a sudden you're a queen, you put  it on one of those squares, and now your queen's gone. 
[00:40:00]  Dude, did I miss the pot party before this show today, by the way?  This is all like pot talk.  No, it's not.  This is pot talk.  I am relating.  Because they're arguing Roger Federer.  Roger Federer is more dominant of an athlete in a real sport than Tiger Woods.  Tiger Woods is a great, leisurely man.  Hobbyist.  Oh, he's a hobbyist.  But Roger Federer is taking other grown men who have, he's taking a ball and hit it in 
[00:40:30]  a hundred and whatever miles an hour at another person, and that person has to hit it back  at him, and he is better at this than this other guy.  This other guy's stopping Roger Federer's skill from happening.  So Tiger's the king of activities.  The king of leisurely activities.  Leisure activities.  Leisure activities.  You know what else, between the golf and the football thing?  With golf, Tiger Woods has had some bad, bad outings.  And people that aren't even professionals have done better than Tiger Woods has done. 
[00:41:00]  These are just people that work at the office.  They come in.  They golf.  They decide they've got to be good, but it's just your average schmo.  You could never put on the gear, go into a professional, go and play against a professional  football team, and you would end up dead.  You would end up dead.  Because of the nature of it. 
[00:41:30]  That too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Any sport that you could possibly challenge a professional at.  A professional.  I don't know how to ski, but I can go, you know what, I'm going to try to ski down a hill  faster than you.  And he can't stop me.  So what if something happens, right?  Now, I cannot beat Kevin Garnett in the basketball game, no matter how much the gods are with me.  If Kevin Garnett would have to be chained to a chair, and he still might beat me.  And he would have to have the flu.  And he would have to be sick.  The flu.  Maybe even rickets. 
[00:42:00]  Shingles.  But I can say, Tiger, I'm going to go at you.  And I'm going to hit this ball.  And by the grace of God, it's possible I can get lucky enough to get a hole in one or birdie  or whatever the stupid things are called.  Birdie.  And it's possible with luck that I can beat Tiger Woods.  Impossible.  But what you're getting at is you actually are competing with him for the entire round  or match.  Right.  In football, you're not competing for the whole game because by the first or second play, 
[00:42:30]  you are out.  You're calling my mother.  How about this?  How about this?  The uniform you wear for your sport, if you could go out to dinner in that same uniform,  it's not a sport.  I'm going to add that one.  I'm moving on from the animals.  Okay.  Yeah.  Like a tennis player can't go out and just go out to a nice dinner in his little tennis  shorts.  So the criteria now, no defense.  What's the other one I said? 
[00:43:00]  There's another one.  You can't wear your clothes.  You can't be able to wear.  You can't wear the same clothes to dinner.  And you can't just play it with somebody.  You can't be a regular person right after.  You have to be able to have to take a shower.  Right.  And take off your jockstrap.  Your sweaty jockstrap.  It was one other reason.  I forgot to.  That there's no chance that you could actually play this game against the professionals.  Right.  All right.  Well, the phones are lit.  They're going to add to this a little bit. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, a bunch of golfers.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, man.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Virus.  Wow.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  The phone's lit.  Let's see what Cleveland's all about today.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, I got an argument for Patrice on that one.  It's only a sport if it can kill you.  Now, that's not a, that's, I mean, that's an argument that's kind of for what I'm saying. 
[00:44:00]  The possibility of dying during golf, again, is maybe hit you.  Yeah.  Or runs over your foot and your foot's infected.  But.  You get nailed by a golf ball in the temple.  Yeah, but that's just.  Golf ball.  It's like being shot.  I've never touched a golf ball.  I don't.  I'm not a hobbyist.  How about the lightning strikes?  That doesn't count.  It's just not a sport.  It's just not a sport.  It's a, it's a competition. 
[00:44:30]  Uh, your, your, your, your number against my number, but it's not a, it's not a sport.  It's just not a sport.  All right.  Let's go to Greg.  Greg, what's up?  Hey, morning, guys.  Good morning, Greg.  When I was in college, I developed full contact golf.  It was probably the most fun we had when we weren't drinking on the golf course.  Well, how do you play?  All right.  It's teams of four.  Each team has a designated hitter.  That guy is the one who hits the ball.  We kind of do what Anthony mentioned, where everybody starts off. 
[00:45:00]  Uh, you know, you start off with two or three different teams.  Everyone starts at the exact same time.  Now, the other three guys on your team that are not your hitters are your blockers.  They may not pick up the ball, but everything else is game.  So you can block the other teammates into their putter, into other putters.  You can block them and hold them over the hole while the other guy's trying to putt the ball into the hole.  What about when you're on the fairway? 
[00:45:30]  When you're on the fairway, you're pretty much just beating the crap out of your friends.  Are you getting in the way of the swinging of a golf club?  You don't want to get in the way of the swinging of a golf club, but you yourself cannot hit the opposing team's putter.  But you can push their own people into the putter.  So while you're on the fairway, you're over there pushing a couple of guys, waiting for the guy just before he's about to swing.  You start body-checking his friends into the swing.  So you can check his friends into the swing. 
[00:46:00]  That's a sport.  That is a sport.  And if Tiger was the best at that, I'd go Tiger Woods is better than Roger Federer if he continuously won at what this guy is saying.  Better at a sport.  If you don't get any 100-yard hits, you don't get someone who hits 200, 300 yards except off the tee.  After that, you're hitting it like maybe 10, 20 yards because you don't want to pull a swing.  You're not trying to nail your friends with a golf club, you know, and that is fun.  You guys are nuts. 
[00:46:30]  That's fun.  All right.  Thanks, sir.  Let's go to Jimmy in Massachusetts.  Jimmy, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  All right, Jimmy.  Let's go back to the chess situation where you say you need defense in the sport, right?  Yes, sir.  And you say, oh, well, if I reach across the table, grab your face and smash it into the chess board.  Okay.  That's a defensive play.  Take, say you put my king in check, though.  Mm-hmm.  I now have to make a defensive play and block that check.  Yeah, I think you're talking chess might have to be a sport there, Patrice. 
[00:47:00]  You know what?  And I'm not married.  There is a defense.  I was playing chess this weekend, matter of fact.  I was doing a lot of defensive moves.  I'm not married to making things not a sport if you can sell.  Now, if you're considering that chess has an official defense, like your skill is affected by somebody else.  Like, you can't have your skill if somebody's not trying to stop you.  That's all I'm saying.  So, if you agree that chess will stop, that that other person's skill can stop yours, then it's a sport. 
[00:47:30]  Why don't we add another rule?  Like, if you have a high IQ playing this sport, it's not a sport.  All right, take downhill skiing, you know, racing or whatever.  My offense is I'm going to get in front of you.  My defense is I'm going to stay in front of you.  I'm not going to let you pass me.  Wrong.  That's not defense.  Oh, that's defense.  That's not defense.  I'll give you chess.  Skiing, that's part of the skill.  But you can't really affect how fast I'm going. 
[00:48:00]  I'm going downhill with you.  You can't touch me.  You can't do anything.  It's the fact that I'm faster on skis than you, which is not a sport.  That's my skill is better than your skill.  I have mastered my hobby.  All right.  I'm not buying the chess one either.  All right.  I don't think I want to say chess either.  You know why?  It's defense but once removed.  It's not defense against you directly. 
[00:48:30]  It's defense once removed to the pieces of the game.  You're adjusting to that guy's move with his skill.  You're adjusting, but you're not affecting what he's doing.  Let's go to Matt in Queens.  Matt, what's up?  Yeah, I'm not buying it.  So chess now.  No.  I'm saying no.  I take it back.  Sorry, dude.  You just had me.  Let's go to Matt in Queens.  Matt.  Good morning.  Good morning.  It's your golf.  You got that windmill blocking the ball.  There you go.  Mention golf is now a sport, Patrice.  You know what? 
[00:49:00]  Mechanical defenses, though.  If you have obstacles.  They can't be man-made.  They got to be human.  It's not.  Thank you, Opie.  It's got to be something that's living and breathing.  Hurdles.  The 20-meter hurdles.  Yeah.  Not a sport.  That's in your way.  In your way?  No.  Detours?  No.  That doesn't make it a sport.  It doesn't matter.  Track and field.  All right.  NASCAR?  Not a sport.  What?  Now you're going to get people crazy.  Now you're going to get people crazy out there. 
[00:49:30]  First of all, it is absolutely illegal in race car driving to affect by actually these  guys getting to fight.  I see it on ESPN.  Dude, you clipped me.  It's illegal to do these things, man.  You're allowed to do a little bumping.  No, you're not.  They bump.  It's accepted.  You're going to get beat up for it.  Smoking weed in Holland or drinking liquor in a bag here.  It's accepted, but it's not legal to touch a man's car while he's driving 200 miles  an hour.  NASCAR is absolutely a sport.  Absolutely. 
[00:50:00]  You got team members on the track helping you out, blocking other drivers.  I don't see it as a sport, though, because it's a car.  No, it's like bicycling.  It's a car.  It's my foot is heavier than your foot, and I'm driving around.  It's a skill.  It's transportation.  Listen, everybody.  If you just dumb down NASCAR to a heavy foot.  It's a skill.  Are you insane?  It's a hobby.  You don't have many rednecks listening to us, Patrice.  Listen, I'm saying it's a skill.  They should be happy with that.  Very skill.  If you have a heavy.  I'm not saying you're a bum if you drive a car 200 miles an hour, but I'm saying it's 
[00:50:30]  not a sport.  You can't.  Now, look.  If crashing your car against the side of the wall was part of the rules, then it's a  sport.  All right.  If I can stop you.  I could drive a couple of hundred miles an hour.  I could do it.  I could do it today.  Right now.  It has nothing to do with it.  You were dying a fiery car crash in a field.  There are old, broken down sons of bitches in a car that could do just as well as a guy 
[00:51:00]  that is good at the sport.  And I'll tell you.  Oh, here it is.  It doesn't fit the criteria.  It was an age thing.  Yeah.  It's not a sport if at 45 you can decide to take it up.  Right.  I was reading about this old NASCAR driver over the weekend.  He's going to be, what, 70, 72?  Oh, Jesus.  Say, stop.  Not allowed.  Stop.  Not allowed.  Look it up.  It was in the paper on Sunday.  Skill, finesse, all that is there.  But sport, I never thought a NASCAR would be in a sport. 
[00:51:30]  How about Dave in Philly?  Dave, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good morning.  Listening to us on WYSP.  What's up, Dave?  Patrice, you couldn't be more wrong, especially about swimming.  Swimming requires mental toughness, unbelievable physical endurance.  Yes.  My son is a state champion swimmer in the state of Pennsylvania.  Great for him.  I dare you to get in the pool with him.  I would never beat your son.  But that little sissy is not doing a sport.  He is swimming against his own self, meaning that no one. 
[00:52:00]  Wait, sir.  No one.  Wait a minute.  No one can take your son's head and dunk it as he's doing his little breaststroke.  I like the opianimal idea for this one.  Thank you.  It's the obvious.  How about you throw a shark in the pool?  Don't stop.  Is it now a sport?  It has to be something.  You're swimming faster and you're trying to avoid the shark?  Wait a minute.  Now, water polo is a sport.  That's a sport.  Your son played water polo, sir.  He's an athlete.  Wait.  Hold on.  He is an athlete anyway, but he's not competing in a sport. 
[00:52:30]  The only sports that you're picking on are sports that black guys suck at.  Why?  It's not my fault.  Maybe that's why they invented those sports, so you can have something to do.  Okay.  Yeah.  Because your son is a swimmer, you're angry because he can't compete with those big giant  N-words that will smash his dumb little butterfly.  I'm going to tell you, something is not a sport if you have the term butterfly in it. 
[00:53:00]  I think he's right, Patrice.  You people can't swim.  We can't swim, but that's not true.  We play hockey now and you let us in there.  Our ankles are stronger.  That's true.  I know.  And he's only a state champion for Pennsylvania.  Oh, my God.  How does he do against Florida?  Come on, man.  Dude, your son is physically gifted, maybe, and he's probably good at it.  He's probably skillful at it, but he's not in a sport.  How fast he swims, no one can affect how fast he swims. 
[00:53:30]  So he's not in a sport.  All right.  Absolutely wrong.  How would they affect it?  Because when he is in a competition and he's swimming, the guy in the lane next to him,  even though there is a lane line in between them, can go over to that lane line and cause turbulence.  Meaning people are going into his lane.  Oh, shut up.  That's just people cause turbulence when they swim.  It's something you've got to get over, but it's not.  Wow.  Now pilots are at least.  I don't see it used much. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Shut up.  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  Shut up.  Man, you're firing up some people today.  And the shark, by the way, is too obvious.  I say big octopus.  Oh, that'd be scary.  Matt, are you just ready to touch the winning, like, the edge of the pool and an octopus grabs  your foot?  Grabs your foot and pulls you backwards a little bit.  Did he win his argument?  No.  Is swimming still not a sport?  It's not a sport.  Thank you.  How about this?  How about this?  Following the Patrice rules, no, it's not.  I could turn anything into a sport that isn't a sport.  All right.  Here it is.  Swimming. 
[00:54:30]  You go to the one end, you do that cool little flip move, and then you've got to swim back,  right?  Yes.  Whoever hits that first thing, there's a button there.  You hit it, every other lane now has a current going in the opposite direction based  on the fact that you got to the other side first.  Nope.  That's just like hurdles.  But you were the one that did it.  It has to be another person.  Yeah.  I hit, I got to the end first.  What if you have your opponent works a wave machine?  As you're trying to do it.  Okay. 
[00:55:00]  Okay.  Wait a minute.  Okay.  Wait a minute.  Let's figure this out.  So he has a wave machine.  Wave machine.  And it's important how fast he's...  It has to be physically exerting to him.  Right.  So...  Oh, now it's completely a sport.  So, but, but, the only person that works the wave machine is the other swimmer.  Right.  So, you're trying to...  If he wears himself out, he's going to suck at swimming.  So, he's got a balance.  It's a fine balance.  Now, that's a sport.  I'll go with that.  That's a sport.  That's a sport now.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  People are like... 
[00:55:30]  People are just waking up, tuning in, going, did these guys smoke pot before their show  today?  This is a legitimate argument.  Pot talk.  And you know where this comes from?  It comes from people, again, if you didn't listen, Roger Federer, who's more dominant  in their sport?  Right.  Roger Federer or Tiger Woods?  Tiger Woods is dominant in his hobby.  Roger Federer is dominant in a sport.  Here's another one.  If you have a lint brush in your equipment bags, can't talk today. 
[00:56:00]  It's not a sport.  If you can wear a sweater vest, if you can wear a wife beater sweater.  If you can wear your same clothes to a christening.  If you don't have to take a shower afterwards.  Yeah.  Swimming, you're already clean.  He'll call back and go, dude, you dumb negro.  It's chlorine.  You know, the eyes can burn. 
[00:56:30]  You can swim in a freshwater lake.  The guy never got...  Yeah, we can all do it.  If after you complete your sport, you can jump in your car and go to a wedding without  changing the sport.  How disappointed was that guy once he found out his son is not an athlete?  We can all...  Like, obviously, we wouldn't beat his son.  Of course not.  But I could do it.  I could jump in the pool.  I could swim to one end.  I could swim to the other.  Let's go to Sonny.  Sonny.  Hey, guys.  How the hell can Patrice turn around and say that skiing is not a sport? 
[00:57:00]  Is it because...  There you go.  I'm going to leave...  I mean, I'm starting to agree from that guy from Cleveland that, you know, black people  don't participate in all these sports.  Ope.  Ope.  What?  Hold up, sir.  I hear your point.  Here's the Kramer situation.  Mm-hmm.  I made them mad enough to start going racial.  Right.  Great point.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  And if you can name a sport that black people don't...  Wait a minute.  Ready?  I'll turn this to... 
[00:57:30]  I'll destroy the racial thing.  All right.  All right.  Listen.  The 100-meter dash is not a sport.  Black people.  Black people.  Right.  All right.  With the agony of defeat guy rolling down that mountain on a ski.  Yeah.  He got defeated in his hobby.  He slipped.  If he got tripped and it was part of the...  Yes.  Thank you, sir.  Do you see where I'm going now?  If you could trip skiers...  Those old...  And it's a sport.  Sir, those old fast-running Negroes, I don't think Jesse Owens was doing a sport. 
[00:58:00]  Right.  Jesse Owens wasn't javelin throwing, it's not a sport.  Yeah, he's beating up his own people there, sonny.  Yeah.  So that's what I'm saying.  It's not a racial thing.  He's saying track and field, well, the...  Well, all track and field, just about, right?  I'm trying to think real fast.  Track and field in general, it's not a sport.  It's athletic.  It's an amazing skill.  You're fast and running, but it's not a sport.  Yeah, you cannot put skiing in the...  Yes, I can.  Skiing is absolutely in there.  Yes.  Tons of people get killed.  Where's the defense? 
[00:58:30]  Tons of people get killed by the obstacles, and the obstacles are dangerous.  I didn't say it wasn't dangerous.  It is not a sport.  Because me going down a hill is not affected by another person pushing me, hitting me, or touching me, so I can do it freely.  And if I suck too bad and I can't miss a tree, that doesn't make me a...  All right, listen, listen, Patrice.  Hold on.  Just get everyone on the same page, because people are just tuning in for the first time. 
[00:59:00]  Basically, Patrice said, you need some type of defense to make it a sport.  That's what we're getting at.  So, with skiing, let's say.  Where's the defense?  Let's say defense is a guy with a blowtorch just messing up the course a little bit.  Would that be good enough?  Doing something.  Where next thing you know, you're flying down a mountain and you hit like a patch of grass or dirt.  Ready?  That would affect your performance.  We're both going down.  Okay.  And I know.  Okay?  You know what?  What makes skiing a sport?  Any James Bond movie where they're skating down and this dude...  And he can do a smoke screen? 
[00:59:30]  He's next to you and he's poking you with those sticks.  Right.  He's kicking you in your face.  Now, that's hard.  And you fall and you win.  Because, put it this way.  If you're better than me and I can beat you by stopping you from being better than me.  Mm-hmm.  By doing something that counteracts your ability.  People are mistaking difficulty, skill.  They're mistaking that for what you're saying.  Why is that not acceptable? 
[01:00:00]  It's skillful.  Right.  It's just not a sport.  Putting down the fact that it's not a skillful thing that takes years of training to get  good at.  And not everybody can be very good at it.  But it's another thing that people do for recreation.  I'm not diminishing the skill.  They strap skis on.  Go to the mountains.  And a lot of people are very good.  And they ski.  And then they go to the lodge.  Have a few hot toddies.  You never see people, like I said, putting on the helmet, the shoulder pads, getting out  there, professional football team, and getting slaughtered. 
[01:00:30]  Right.  Even flag football.  Nobody's getting touched.  But for me to be able to run and keep you from grabbing my towel outside of my pants.  It's competing with a person.  It's a sport.  You're competing with a person.  And if it's accepted that you can drink while you do it, it's not a sport.  It's falling to you.  Absolutely not.  Thank you very much.  But with golf, because this started with Tiger Woods, what about blindside tackling?  What about you're officially against Tiger Woods?  Right.  And your whole job as he's playing is to kind of blend in with the crowd and then make 
[01:01:00]  your move and do your blindside tackle.  Strategically, Opie, you just made golf a sport.  Strategically.  Now, with that guy, it's an awful kind of pressure.  Right.  So, Tiger's looking over his shoulder.  Looking around.  Wonder where the blindside tackle's coming from.  Maybe you get five, you call it surprises.  They're in golf.  Right.  Where five times your opponent.  Some guy in the gallery.  Strategically.  That's what I mean.  Some guy just standing in the gallery.  That's supposed to be one of those claps after the shot guys. 
[01:01:30]  And at any hole, this guy could be there and just run out and tackle you.  And like football, they have the Motorola things and the guy upstairs and he goes just  like a football, like, what's the thing?  A challenge?  Yeah.  Somebody's upstairs going, okay.  All right.  He's good.  Now.  Send him now.  Boom!  Each golfer has five of these guys somewhere on the course.  He would be petrified every hole.  How could you tee off? 
[01:02:00]  How?  How?  And you can't.  There's no home field advantage in golf because no one can talk.  No one can go.  Tiger.  No fans of Payne Stewart.  I think Payne Stewart died, but I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  Hold on really fast.  No fans of him can affect.  They can't even say Tiger sucked.  Yeah, let me throw that in there.  It's not a sport if you're a viewer or whatever and you're not allowed to cheer and yell and  cheer.  To cheer or root for your favorite guy.  During the game. 
[01:02:30]  Absolutely.  During game play.  You can't have concentration during a sport.  Yeah.  Huh?  Just throw out tennis.  Yeah, tennis.  No, no, no, no.  Wait a minute, though.  Wait a minute.  The point, Dan.  We're talking aspects, Dan.  Tennis is a sport because I'm trying to stop you.  That is a sport.  So we can do that with no audience.  Right.  You can play football with no audience.  But I'm saying that football, dude, you're dealing also with people yelling.  You're dealing with this guy calling you stupid. 
[01:03:00]  Negroes don't play.  Hey, now, I got to deal with that as I'm trying to smash somebody in their face or  they're trying to hit me in my face.  Yeah.  That's a sport.  But golf, shh.  All right.  Kill that squirrel.  Hold on.  We got a couple more calls and we're going to move on here.  Joe in Jersey.  What's up?  Yeah.  Hey.  Yeah.  I agree with Patrice to an extent.  And the whole thing is a sport is something where you compete against another team.  Teams have a lot to do with it.  You know, if I can't score more than you, it's not a sport. 
[01:03:30]  Thank you.  Well, no.  Because golf, you can score more than me.  You can just score.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you know what?  I need to be able to shoot ahead of you then.  And if you get up to my hole and you can pass me, then you can tackle me and stop me from  taking a putt.  There's plenty of ways to make it a sport.  Let's go to Chris in Pittsburgh.  Chris, he knows how to make skiing a sport.  Go ahead, Chris.  Patrice, I think the only way you'd be able to make skiing a sport, let's say that Anthony is  the skier.  You stand on the hillside with a hose and spray him as he tries to get out of the hill. 
[01:04:00]  Yes.  All right.  That's good.  And I have to be the skier.  Right.  I have to also, I have to then ski.  Yeah, you can't have a designated hose guy.  And it has to be strategic.  It has to be the hoser.  It has to be a strategic time where I can use the hose.  Can we sell this to ESPN?  Man, we're coming up with a great, great show, man.  Are you kidding me?  Let me tell you something.  Can you imagine if we...  Should I even open my mouth about this today?  Because this is a show. 
[01:04:30]  This is so a show.  This is a show.  And I was saying...  You get people to...  Hold on.  Real sports.  Hold on.  You get people to sign away their lives and you play golf our way.  The Opie and Anthony and Patrice way.  Where you got five guys on your team somewhere ready to blindside you.  Blindside tackles.  Oh, I'm telling...  I was sitting there going, should I...  Because who wouldn't watch...  It's like, okay...  Who wouldn't watch a downhill skier and you don't know where that...  We make them a sport.  We make them a sport.  The fire hose is coming from.  The fire hose guy is. 
[01:05:00]  The fire hose guy.  God, I'm so pissed.  I'm so pissed.  Just knocks him off his feet.  Who wouldn't watch that?  Who wouldn't watch that?  Who wouldn't watch golf every Sunday?  If you knew at any given time there was going to be...  Someone's going to come running out and just blindside him.  Kind of like the new Tiger Woods commercial where he tackles the dude.  There you go.  Imagine if you get to see that during the actual sport or the competition or whatever.  And Opie, did you see that they made a big deal out of that?  That Tiger tackled the dude?  Yeah.  Because Tiger innately knows he's not doing a sport. 
[01:05:30]  But he's athletic.  So when he did that, they were like, hey man, Tiger...  He was showing that he is an athlete.  Hey, dude, you got to be careful.  They got stuntmen for that.  And Tiger's like, I can do that.  Right.  Did you see how upset, and I think it was the first jackass or one of them, that the  golfers got when they blew off those air horns in the bushes?  They'd hide in the bushes, wait for these guys to tee off and blow the air horn.  Hey, hey now.  Yep.  Yep.  Should be able to do that.  Opie.  All right. 
[01:06:00]  We start with golf.  We'll end with golf.  Here's Ken.  Ken, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  Hey, man.  What's up?  I think Patrice is absolutely right.  It is an acquired skill.  It is not a sport.  Anything like bocce, darts, bowling that you can play while drinking a scotch and having  a cigar is definitely not a sport.  It's a acquired skill.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Yep.  Anything you can play at a nudist camp is not a sport.  Billiards could possibly, under my rules, could possibly maybe be a sport. 
[01:06:30]  That's kind of like chess.  It's kind of like a chess one.  You're through a second generation of defense.  You're not physically, your body defending, but you're putting balls in position.  It's not a sport if it's just obstacles.  But we've all played extreme pool.  Who hasn't played extreme pool where you're allowed to shoot at the guy who's trying to  shoot?  You get a little drunk and it becomes a whole new thing.  The balls are launching off the table.  Oh, yeah.  Smacking into each other full speed. 
[01:07:00]  What?  That idea.  I love your idea.  Oh, yeah.  No, get.  Just kidding.  He's doing nothing.  Get him in there right now and pitch it.  And pitch it.  Get him to pitch it.  All right.  Why don't we move on?  We got to 72.  He's 72.  NASCAR run at 72.  Good old James Hilton, right?  No one would have swollen prostate should be able to do anything.  Run the 72.  I believe he was.  The Ford Model T.  Gets it out there. 
[01:07:30]  He's pranked it first.  He was just passing him at 200 miles an hour.  He's doing like 38.  He probably has a scarf and big goggles.  Those big goggles.  Yeah.  Driving gloves and a hat.  Can I go with the hack line?  He's going to have his blinker on the whole time.  Because he's old.  He's going to have his left hand blinker on the whole time. 
[01:08:00]  Loser.  No blinkers in NASCAR.  So it's impossible.  It's got to be based on reality.  Yeah.  Good old James Hilton making a NASCAR run at 72.  At an age when some 72-year-olds are having their licenses repossessed, James Hilton is cranking it up on a racetrack at the Daytona 500 at 185 miles per hour plus.  Yeah.  They've been joking about it, Hilton said, the other day from his shop in Inman, South Carolina.  They said, Jeff Gordon came into the garage area too hard and ran over my walker. 
[01:08:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You're driving around in a little rascal.  One of those little souped up little rascals.  Whatever.  He's going to.  His car, it should come with a Tommy gun and someone trying to kill him.  On the running boards.  Right.  Ma, ma, mugsy.  Ma.  That would make NASCAR a sport if you could have that going on.  Defend.  Right.  You got your guys shooting out tires as you go.  Or, yeah, the other people from the other pit crew, when they come into the pits, they can throw down those police spike strips when they're ready to leave the pit. 
[01:09:00]  Brand new tires.  All right.  We got Winnie.  We got him.  Well, Winnie, what's up?  Make it fast, will you?  Okay.  I just want to know.  It's mugging a sport.  Mugging.  Why?  Mugging somebody.  Yeah, that's, uh, let's see.  It's a guy, and he's in direct competition with somebody else, and there's a valuable prize at the end.  Hell, then.  I'm listening to all these crazy things here, and I just saw them. 
[01:09:30]  Well, Winnie, if you're going to go that far, you might as well go all the way, and then rape's a sport.  Rape would be a sport.  Let's be honest here.  It truly is.  It came out of your mouth, but we got to take it to the limit on this show.  There's two people involved.  One is trying to protect something from another.  Another competitor, another athlete.  And one is certainly trying to score.  Right.  You know, when you put one between the uprights.  He was not ready to go the distance with that one. 
[01:10:00]  I understand.  He had a little funny mugging corp.  He probably had a tinge of racialness to it.  And then it's like, hey, rape's a sport.  All right, you went too far.  All right.  All right.  Get on with you.  I'm going back to Whoopi.  I'm going to go wake up with Whoopi.  Where is wake up with Whoopi?  Yeah, screw it.  All right.  We got a break.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, my God.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony.  Well-timed this year.  All right.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:10:30]  Good morning.  Patrice O'Neill giving us a lot of energy today.  And we need it.  It's a Monday.  State the obvious, I know.  I'm just a little tired today.  Hey, State.  We were talking about Hillary and Obama during the break.  Patrice, help me out here.  Hillary's on the trail.  Help me out.  She's starting early.  Anthony will not answer this simple question.  Okay.  Would he vote for a black president or a female president? 
[01:11:00]  He has no choice.  Can't answer.  And he will not answer.  Female.  Even in the fantasy world.  You'd vote for female.  No, I can't answer, honestly.  You're not voting for a black man.  You don't have a choice.  What would your answer be?  I also can't vote for a woman.  And it's not.  It's based on what is good for this country.  The country itself would friggin' lose its mind.  I don't think.  Put it this way.  The president is a position. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  That can never slow down.  Right.  And God has put too many mechanisms in place in front of women for them to slow up.  And every month when it's Vietnam down there, slow down.  You gotta sit to pee.  You gotta have a kid.  God wants you to not move like that.  Could you see a pregnancy leave for the president?  Well, that's what I'm saying.  Lisa Leslie, one of the best basketball players in the WNBA, took leave of absence, not for a PCL injury, not for bad back spasms. 
[01:12:00]  Because she got pregnant.  Pregnancy.  And you're not allowed to.  And she had to take, what, one or two seasons off?  She had to take a season off.  The first season, to have it.  The second season, to love it.  To nurture it.  Now, you're messing up.  That's why it has to be a male president, because you have to move.  Hillary, hold on, but the age requirement for, you know, being the president takes that out of the ballgame.  No matter women have babies.  Hillary's not gonna have a baby if she's in office.  And this is just the first one. 
[01:12:30]  You want somebody having menstrual cramps, deciding on whether we're gonna rocket something or not?  Or going through menopause, then.  All right.  Older broad's going through menopause.  She's got her hot flashes when she's sitting in that chair next to a diplomat.  She's sweating in the Oval Office.  I'm getting a flash during the State of the Union address.  We don't need our president taking Levitra.  Oh.  Well.  He won't answer the question, though.  It'll be, just because I think.  Because it's equal turmoil.  I'll talk to him.  You know, we've talked.  We've had this conversation on the radio.  Certainly. 
[01:13:00]  I feel, out of your isms, racism is more prevalent in me.  Prevalent in me.  Than your sexism.  Sexism.  Yes.  But, no.  In certain places, yes.  In other places, no.  In this studio, right here, as I do my job, on a daily basis, sexism way outdoes racism.  Way.  I would rather have 18 black people, I have no idea who they are, than one woman come in here and spout off her bullcrap woman hole crap radio kryptonite garbage. 
[01:13:30]  Okay.  So, it's in certain situations.  That almost made sense.  But, in your isms, you're saying that your sexism is greater than your racism.  In the presidency, I believe my sexism comes in more than racism.  I still haven't figured it out, though.  But, it's still too close.  I'm still dealing with it.  I don't think this country...  I think it's very extreme for this country to feel like they can vote for an Obama as president. 
[01:14:00]  But, they certainly can vote for Powell.  So, I think they can vote for Colin Powell versus Hillary Clinton.  I think it would be Colin Powell.  But, Powell screwed up like a real white person to white people.  Take the race out of it.  He screwed up like a real white person.  They would look at his record, not his race.  They would say, this son of a bitch went to the U.N. with a bunch of crap that Bush handed him and presented it.  And, he screwed his whole career up politically doing that. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, and he's black.  They wouldn't care about the blackness because the guy didn't come off like a homie.  The guy didn't come off...  Obama doesn't either.  But, let me tell you, the name is going to hurt him.  The name...  And, he's too black.  He hangs around with black people.  Black people would love him innately because...  See, the thing about this country that I've explained is...  Is that black leaders are not voted for.  Black leaders are appointed by...  Appointed by their constituency. 
[01:15:00]  No, no, no.  They're appointed by who white people hate the most.  White people appoint black leaders.  You know, Al Sharpton, white people hate someone.  Right.  You are a black leader.  Oh, good point.  But, they have not put Obama as a black leader because the guy is so...  They don't hate him.  So, they're trying to eliminate his blackness.  But, black people...  He has this thing where black people are going to love him.  And, that's why he's going to be in trouble.  It's bad for white people to come off as if they hate Obama.  Right.  It makes you look bad.  Hillary, if Obama was Bill Johnson, some white guy, and he was running on the Democratic ticket and had as much heat as he does against Hillary, Hillary would be bashing the crap out of this guy. 
[01:15:30]  She is going out of her way to be polite to him, saying, well, he's a bit inexperienced, you know, in office.  And, she should be laying into him.  She should be using the N-word.  They might be running mates, though.  Might be.  But, that never stopped the Democrats before the primary.  It never stopped them from bashing each other. 
[01:16:00]  It's a bit different this time around for some reason.  That's another thing, is that I don't think it'll happen because you can be a covert racist and vote.  They don't say, all right, Fred Smith from Iowa, who'd you vote for?  It's like, shh, we don't tell that.  But, if you had to say who you'd vote for, then it's...  All right.  I don't see him.  And, you had a thought about the top-grossing artists of the year?  Concerts of this year.  And, that's why we won't have a black president or a female president. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  Number one was the Rolling Stones because whenever they come out of mothballs and tour, the money just rolls in.  They made $150 million on tour last year.  Amazing.  And, what was number two of the year?  Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.  Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.  I rest my case.  Who was first?  The Rolling Stones.  Whenever they roll them out, they're going to win.  They're going to get first.  And, you got Rascal Flatts.  Rascal Flatts is third?  Yeah.  Then, you got Madonna.  All right.  See, this is why.  Country. 
[01:17:00]  Tell you the truth.  Country.  Then, you got Kenny Chesney, another country.  Kenny Chesney.  These are the people.  You friggin' idiots that live in the cities of this country.  L.A., New York City, Chicago.  These are Boston.  Listen, these, you don't think like the majority of this country.  The majority of this country is throwing around the N-word like crazy when Obama comes up.  They're throwing around the C-word when it comes to Hillary.  They're not voting for these people.  And, they're the ones that have the masses. 
[01:17:30]  Those are the numbers.  You get the cities and it's like, wow, we are such a free-thinking society.  Look, it's the first time ever we're really seriously going to have a black candidate and a women candidate.  And, shut up.  Look who friggin' is going to the concerts and what concerts they're going to.  You don't get excited by the possibilities of something different.  Stop it.  It ain't going to happen.  It's going to be another white guy in office for four years.  I agree with you.  It's going to happen.  Hey, well, Hillary was...  And, if the Democrats don't smarten up and see that and get a good white candidate in there to run, 
[01:18:00]  we're going to go right back to having a Republican in there for four more years.  How long is it going to take for this country to be ready to run?  Flying cars in my large suits, my friend, before we ever see black president.  Space food.  Space food.  Martian colonies.  Squeezing your food out of, like, toothpaste containers.  Martian colonies.  Yeah.  White people are very afraid.  What did you say?  The president of Mars?  The president of Mars can be a black guy.  Oh, my God.  I will give him the presidency of Mars. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, my God.  That's so foul.  The president of Mars.  Yeah, because he just has to rule over amoebas and stuff.  Come on, man.  Oh, y'all are awful.  We'll give you Mars.  We'll give you Mars.  There's something living in that, like, muck.  Black president of Mars.  White people aren't so afraid.  Or if a meteor gets ready to hit the planet, there'll be a black president of Mars.  Your president, help us out here.  Here's a problem, too, with black president.  If it's a black vice president.  I'm sorry to cut you off. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  It's possible if, like you said, if a white guy, right now, if a white guy ran for president  and Obama was his running mate.  Still a tough sell.  It's possible.  That's going to be a tough sell.  And if something happens to that guy.  Oh, my goodness.  Obama be the president.  Polkemobiles and just keep that guy in a bulletproof glass case and carry him around.  Is it still that bad?  Is it still that bad?  Yeah.  It's still that bad with the rest of the country.  We have free thinking, nice, the major cities.  But it gets crazy when you get out there. 
[01:19:30]  Did you hear Hillary over the weekend?  She was kind of cute.  Talking about evil men.  Oh, really?  And how she knows evil men.  She was married to one.  Or is married to one, technically.  Good for her.  Hillary Clinton was on the campaign trail in Iowa today, but absolutely shocked people  with a comment that some believe was a shot of their husband.  But what did she really mean by...  The news just sucks.  Shock politician.  Look at the face she's got on the front page of the post. 
[01:20:00]  She's smiling and pointing.  Yeah, just having fun with this.  But the news makes it sound like she was definitely going after her husband.  That could be a you son of a bitch.  Oh, man.  You think?  That was an I support my husband.  Well, they know it's in the best interest of her running for president that they all  of a sudden be seen together.  These two idiots haven't even kissed in public or held hands since he was thrown out of office  or whatever.  Since he was out of office.  They obviously got some kind of arrangement.  Now, she's running.  They know that you got to look like a family. 
[01:20:30]  So he's going to support her.  There's no love there.  Get out of here.  Who's buying this crap?  I think, by the way, she is absolutely the best looking first lady I've ever seen.  Do you?  I think she's the best.  Laura Bush?  No, no, no.  Let me see.  Jackie O in her day?  You thought Hillary Clinton was better looking than freaking Laura Bush?  Jackie O in her day.  Absolutely.  Now, Jackie O with those Elliot eyes.  I'm sorry.  In her day.  Not the old Jackie O walking around Manhattan. 
[01:21:00]  I'm talking about the young one.  Her eyes were too far apart.  Absolutely.  The young Jackie O.  I'm sorry about that.  I take that back.  When they first hooked up, Jackie O and Kennedy, when they first hooked up, Jackie O was cute.  I forgot about Jackie O.  Then she turned into some monster walking around New York City with a big friggin' ant glasses.  I was a fan of Lady Bird.  Ooh, Jesus.  Lady Bird Johnson.  Wow.  How do you like that?  It's stupid.  Lady Bird.  Lady Bird Johnson.  Look at her eyes, though.  They're too far apart.  Eleanor Roosevelt.  Now, there's a hottie.  Oh, man.  And I'm talking about during the presidency. 
[01:21:30]  Right.  Not when she was 16.  Yeah, yeah.  During the presidency, I thought Hillary wasn't a bad looking guy.  All right.  I guess you got to take, yeah, Jackie O would be on top of everyone's list.  Jackie O.  Jackie O.  But she's in a league of her own, then.  All right.  Who would you go with next?  Hillary.  Hillary over Laura Bush.  It's better looking than Laura Bush.  You're insane.  She really is, man.  You're insane.  She got a meaty little dumper.  All of them look the same up in her life.  Barbara Bush.  That old broad.  Who?  The mother of the president.  You're insane.  You know what's great about Barbara Bush?  The mother of the president's father. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  I said it the other day, she hasn't aged in 20-some-odd years.  Because now she's catching up to how she was supposed to look.  And George Bush is finally looking the same age as Barbara Bush.  Yeah.  She looked years older than the guy.  But she has not aged since then, for some weird reason.  Cryogenic freezing.  She went from 39 to 70 in one year.  But she looked 70 at 39.  Right.  So now that's caught up. 
[01:22:30]  But now she's been...  She just looked that age all her life.  But now she's looked 70, 75 for the last 20 years.  She's going to wake up one morning and George Bush Sr. is just going to look over and there's  going to be a pile of dust with a white wig on it.  She's just going to completely disintegrate.  I hate to say that, but he...  Barbara, she might have been the most uncomfortable.  Yeah.  It was almost like that deaf comedian who...  Oh, you don't want to watch it.  You try to listen to the funniness that she's going...  And you're like, wow, I got to pretend that this is not happening.  Every time I saw old school Barbara Bush, I just would go, this guy looks better than 
[01:23:00]  this.  Yeah.  He deserves better.  Like, this is truly love.  Not only did she look exactly the same, but she hasn't changed her clothes.  Yeah, right.  She wears that blue suit with the bouffant hair, the big afro, and the white string of pearls  around her neck everywhere.  It's scary.  Laura, Laura is a good-looking...  Laura...  Laura Bush is a good-looking...  As a first lady is a good-looking...  She's got to go funny eyes, I think, a little bit, like a Reba.  But...  Reba. 
[01:23:30]  But she's not bad.  All right, let's...  This is what Hillary was up to over the weekend.  ...on the campaign trail in Iowa today, but absolutely shocked people with a comment...  ...wronged...  ...some believe was a shot of their husband.  No, you believe.  What did she really mean by it?  In many ways, New York Senator Hillary Clinton's first foray onto the 2008 presidential campaign  trail was a success, even exceeding some of the campaign's own expectations.  But if critics were looking for something to complain about, they may have found it in  her answer to an audience member's question. 
[01:24:00]  It was posed, what equips her as a woman to deal with some of the world's evil and bad men?  She repeated the question, and the reaction raised eyebrows.  Well, the question really is, we face a lot of dangers in the world, and in the gentleman's  words, we face a lot of evil men.  You know, people like Osama bin Laden comes to mind.  And what in my background equips me to deal with evil and bad men?  And that's when she was pointing at her husband. 
[01:24:30]  Man, she compared her husband to Osama bin Laden.  No, man.  No, she was just trying to have some fun.  She was making a mockery at the press.  She made a joke.  Like, you made my husband evil, and I'm...  To her, he was evil.  That wasn't shocking.  Wait a minute, to her, the husband was evil.  She was just having fun with it.  They weren't sleeping together.  And I'm going to tell you, Bill Clinton was such a pimp.  I believe that she knew...  There's no way he didn't say, look, I'm getting a little side. 
[01:25:00]  And she's like, sweetie, I don't care.  Yeah, but keep it on the QT.  Not only did she know, she was getting some of his, you know, leftovers.  She was doing something on the side, too.  Yeah, she was doing something.  There's no way...  They were working that angle together, I bet you.  He blew it.  That's what...  Well, I think her making a joke out of it is kind of good for her.  Okay.  I could see that.  Yeah.  Because a lot of the, I think, when the Republicans start getting a hold of her, it's all going  to be about, you know, you couldn't even keep an eye on your husband. 
[01:25:30]  You're supposed to keep an eye on our country.  There's going to be a lot of that going on.  What?  So she better get this out of the way quick.  It's going to be a lot of fun as we move forward here.  And this country is desperately trying to get a Democratic president.  Yeah, all the Democrats have to do is come up with one qualified guy.  Bush has screwed up so badly that they have to really screw the pooch on this one to not  get a Democrat in there.  But I guarantee they will.  They'll mess this up.  If they go with a gag ticket, they will absolutely screw this up. 
[01:26:00]  If they mess this up, they should retire the party like they retired the wigs.  Bring back the wigs.  Like the wigs.  The wig party.  They should go the way of the wigs if they blow this one.  I'm running under the wig ticket.  There's so many Republicans that are like, you know what?  I'm going to vote Democrat this time around.  Yeah.  There's a bunch of people out there saying, I'm going Democrat.  They want one.  I need something different here.  Don't give us joke tickets.  Don't give us novelty ticket. 
[01:26:30]  It's a novelty.  Oh, there's a woman.  See, Obama is not a novelty, but this country is just too racist.  It's just a deal with it, man.  Yeah.  All right.  Listen, really fast, before we take a break, good old No Filter Paul was at it again.  When did this happen?  Friday?  Yeah, I think so.  That's when I got my news alert on the email.  What?  That's when I got my news alert on the email from him.  Oh, he tells you when it happens?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Sends me the file.  I laugh my ass off. 
[01:27:00]  No Filter Paul did an assault on the media on Friday.  And he also put together a montage of a lot of assaults on the media.  That's right.  The rock montage.  And it's up on opiananthony.com.  He did a very, very good job.  All the assaults on the media that have happened over the years.  Where is this available to view?  Opiananthony.com.  Okay, because you've got to see this.  He does the assault on the media.  This woman is doing a report.  Oh, the new one's up there.  And then, of course, it's part of the montage that he just made on his own. 
[01:27:30]  Thank you.  The new one, he is behind the reporter with the sign, Opiananthony, Opiananthony.  That's only half of it.  When they go back to that female anchor, her teeth are ready to just explode in her mouth.  She is fighting down like this.  She's going, thank you.  She is more pissed than I've ever seen a newscaster.  Yeah. 
[01:28:00]  Livid.  Well, we don't think what they do is news.  We don't think what they do is serious.  We don't think anything.  It's newsertainment.  That's what it is.  Newsertainment.  News, not a sport.  No.  And if news was a sport, it would not be a sport.  Right.  That would be funny.  Imagine one.  Used to be.  Imagine one news station had the balls to have blindside tackling.  And they say it right at the top of the newscast.  During the news today.  Could be the weather girl. 
[01:28:30]  Sometime between the next, somewhere in the next half hour, there's going to be a blindside tackle as you're watching.  Could be the anchor.  Could be the sports guy.  Could be somebody.  You never know.  You never know.  You would watch.  You could blindside tackle the cameraman.  You'd just see the shot get all messed up.  Blindside the light guy.  So the lights go falling down.  You'd definitely tune in.  Oh, I would watch every night.  Massive ratings.  Massive.  Well, here's No Filter, Paul.  It's up on opiananthony.com.  The montage is up on opiananthony.com.  But here's the latest assault on the media from No Filter, Paul. 
[01:29:00]  And this murder investigation has become the talk of the town.  In fact, today we saw many people driving by this police scene, even stopping to take a look at what they were doing.  That's partially because murders are so unusual here in this town.  The mayor of Tintin.  Live from Tintin Falls, Paisley Chang, News Channel 4.  All right, Paisley, thank you so much.  Thank you so much.  Oh, you can't even hear it.  Thank you so much.  Oh, she was pissed.  Thank you so much. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, I love how she just has to stop talking.  She doesn't.  Listen again.  Listen again.  Hold on.  Hold on.  And this murder investigation has become the talk of the town.  In fact, today we saw many people driving by this police scene, even stopping to take a look at what they were doing.  That's partially because murders are so unusual here in this town.  The mayor of Tintin.  Live from Tintin Falls, Paisley Chang, News Channel 4.  All right, Paisley, thank you so much.  She cut off her report, didn't she?  Yeah.  And then she was in mid-sentence.  And she went live from, she was in mid-sentence. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, she said, screw this.  And she just bailed out of the report.  How does he know to go to where he goes?  He is like Kreskin when it comes to these things.  He just knows.  Somehow he knows.  I don't question it.  The assault in the media thing has just become his.  It's just his thing now.  It's his thing he does.  It's his thing.  He's very good at it.  And he does it.  It's a reason to just show up and have it all ready.  Yeah.  The latest video.  It's great.  It's up on opanthony.com.  I've never seen a news truck, even by mistake. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, and the news truck's there.  The camera's out.  They're ready to roll.  He's got everything going.  And taping it.  And he's sitting there just with his wrestling, his board.  We know him.  His opanthony.  His little man.  His sign.  And he's just.  That's great.  Jeez.  By the way, we don't really endorse the assault on the media.  It's not like we're giving prizes away like we used to.  They do what they do out there.  Yeah, whatever they want to do.  Just a little bit of advice.  Don't touch anybody, please. 
[01:31:00]  No.  I was watching the montage that's up on opanthony.com, and some of them are just beyond hilarious.  The tug-of-war one outside Letterman's studio.  There's a bunch of them where you just see animals jumping out of news trucks and tackling fans of the show.  All right.  Yeah, it's a good one.  Thank you, Paul.  We got lots still to do with Patrice O'Neill in studio. 
[01:31:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.

[01:32:00]  And I'm Patrice O'Neill, joining them and relaxing because it's early in the morning.  You know, I like to get up early in the morning, y'all.  Who doesn't?  I like to entertain and like to talk to you.  You should say, I'm in for the vacationing, Jim Norton.  Not vacationing, but like in the news.  The Austin vacationing, Jim Norton, by the way.  Oh, no.  The...  The Opie and Anthony Show with your host, Chris O'Neill in for Jim Norton.  I like when they do that on the news.  When like, the guy's just missing and they just, he's in. 
[01:32:30]  But no...  The Opie and Anthony Show with Jim Norton.  Jim Norton.  You know what's great about the news scenario, though?  You don't even know the difference.  Who cares?  You're like, I thought you were the guy.  I don't know.  Don't matter.  You're not that important in my life.  I just thought you were the guy.  Goddamn Fast Times at Ridgemont High football player won the SAG Award.  Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor, huh?  He's going to win the Oscar for King of Scotland. 
[01:33:00]  I'm just calling him Fast Times at Ridgemont High football guy.  Jefferson.  His name is Forrest Whitaker.  I know.  Respect him.  I give him some respect.  I know all the white actors.  That's actually very good.  Even in that.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  We got so much to do.  I don't know where to go.  Where do you want to go?  You want to...  Ah, just grab something, throw it in, and we'll laugh at it.  All right.  It is a weird, like, slow news day.  We took care of the politics.  We took care of the golf is not a sport.  It was good. 
[01:33:30]  Uh, we took care of, like, uh, pot talk in general today.  A lot of pot talk today.  Where you talk like you're on pot, not talking about pot.  I understand that.  Okay.  Well, she makes it really easy for us, and we try, we really try to not go here.  But this time around, we can't help ourselves.  Karen Meyer is back.  Karen Meyer.  Love her.  We can't get enough of Karen Meyer, but we kind of think, in a way, it might be too easy  and too mean. 
[01:34:00]  But, you know, when she's doing something called Crip Slam Sundays, it is our job to play the  audio.  What is it?  Crip Slam Sundays.  Karen Meyer, of course, she's a news, uh, a news who-er from Chicago.  Jesus, you're trying to be nice?  A news who-er.  She does the, uh, like, uh, little human interest, uh, uh, disabled stories.  Well, she's deaf, and she's on the news.  She's deaf.  Which is just amazing to me.  It's amazing to me.  They have to run subtitles under her, uh, her reports, because you really can't understand 
[01:34:30]  what she's saying.  See, if Karen Meyer's allowed to do the news, then I should be allowed to just play on the  PGA Tour.  Yeah, why not?  Why not?  Like, why is she on the news?  Except for the fact it's something people talk about, and it's a freak show.  It's a gimmick.  A lot of these people have styles.  She has substance.  It's a gimmick.  How do you know if she has substance?  You don't, you can't even understand what she's saying.  You have to read.  She makes you have to read the news. 
[01:35:00]  That's right.  You have to-  If I wanted to read the news, I'd pick up the New York Times.  You're going to have to read Pan's Labyrinth.  You're going to have to read, you have to, you had to read, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,  I'm not reading-  Downfall.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  Das Boot.  Guess what?  Das Boot.  Read it.  Decide not to read those films.  Just because she said, where are we quitting?  You have to understand she means Hillary.  Oh.  My mom, my mama.  You have to understand that it's Barack Obama.  All you got to do is listen to her.  Listen with your heart and not with your ears. 
[01:35:30]  She's making a mockery of us broadcasters.  What you-  How about that?  What you, Opie?  She's making a mockery of the business audience.  Back it through.  Back it through, Al.  What do you say, Al?  What do you say, Al?  Does that make it through?  What do you say, Al?  Al.  Welcome, Opie.  That's a judgment call that Al's going to have to make. 
[01:36:00]  What do you say, Al?  He has no idea.  He's throwing his arms up in the air.  I don't know.  It kind of sounded like it, I guess, with a W.  So, Karen-  What does she do a story on?  It's Crip Slam Sunday.  She does the disability stories.  I don't know what Crip Slam Sunday is.  We're going to find out here.  No, we're not.  Is that anything-  Oh, yeah.  I would love to know.  Is that anything like Blood Slam Tuesday?  Yeah. 
[01:36:30]  I'm thinking the Crips.  Is it the Crips?  He's kind of ripping us off.  Tell him, Fred, who, who, who.  Because-  Oh, no.  Back in the day, we started a thing called Crip Bouts.  Ah, yes.  Cripple Fights.  Cripple Fights.  And we want to call it Crip Bouts.  And someone reminded us that maybe you shouldn't show favoritism to the Crips.  Yeah.  And we're saying, no, Crips as in cripples.  But I guess it was too close.  And it got people nervous.  So we changed it into, what, Cripple Bouts or something like that?  Yeah.  Something like that.  All right.  Well, she's doing Crip Slam Sundays. 
[01:37:00]  Well, it's live performances by people with disabilities about disabilities.  All right.  See, you're right.  We had to go here now.  I got to hear this.  This is like people performing.  And they have disabilities.  And their performances are based on their disabilities.  Correct.  Oh, I love this.  We moved this, Denny.  Nothing better than a comic with CP or something that goes up.  We moved this, Denny.  Come on, ma and ma.  Ma and ma. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's despicable.  And I want to hear every moment of it.  All right.  Here's Karen Meyer.  She's out of Chicago, by the way.  It's the minor countdown.  What does it have to be?  Bad 80s songs, by the way.  That's all they hear.  They were taught in it.  They don't know what new music is.  That was the last time they heard.  I get it.  They're deaf now.  Oh, God.  Come on, ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma and ma.

[01:42:00]  Of course, yeah  I mean, ear points and all that  But we gotta go a lot further than that  No, because you kind of still hear it resonating in your head  Yeah, that's the problem, right?  Like, they can't even hear that  Oh, really?  That's the difference?  Ice pick into the ears  If anybody wants to do it  I think the lawyers will frown upon it  I wanna be  No, you just know  Because you already know what you sound like  That's why  Yeah  That's why deaf people talk like that  The police  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  No, no, no  Na, na, na  Na, na, na  Na, na, na, na  Na, na, na, na  Na, na, na  Na, na, na, na

[01:44:00]  When you do a show like ours  The problem is  Everyone laughs until it hits too close to home  And then it's like  Hey, I enjoy everything else you guys do  Exactly  But  The deaf thing  Not funny  Because I got  My son's a sissy swimmer  My son is deaf  He's like  Alright, we get it  I'm diabetic  You still eat cookies  Alright, let's go to Dom  I couldn't hear it  Through the grapevine  I couldn't hear it  Through the grapevine  Let's go to Dom in Jersey  Dom  Hey, what's up guys?

Yeah, it's Keith  Alright, Keith 
[01:45:00]  What's up?  Maybe I'm deaf  You can get the same sound  If you do Novocaine karaoke  Hmm  Oh, dead in the mouth  You know something  How do we dead in the mouth?  That's legally  We need a licensed dentist  With Novocaine  To shoot  To just shoot it into people's mouths  That's what they sell over the counter  To make you mouth numb  Nah, that doesn't work as good  I'm talking that  When they gotta work on your bottom teeth  And they hit that nerve  Right at the jawbone 
[01:45:30]  Where it just deadens half your face  Do it to both sides  And then have them sing karaoke  Yeah  You'll be wishing you didn't do it  Oh, is that great?  Oh, man  Let's say hi to Carlin in Massachusetts  Carlin, what's up?  Hey, you mentioned deaf karaoke  There's actually a bar in Quincy, Mass  That has a deaf rapper on karaoke night  Oh, wow  We need audio  We need audio  I'll see what I can pull off the board  But I mean, the guy starts  And goes like two minutes past the end of the song  Because he just has no idea 
[01:46:00]  He comes up with his own lyrics  Just curses people out  And it has nothing to do with the song that he picked  Up the police  Up the police  What do you say, Al?  Al  A lot of judgment calls today, huh, Al?  Let's go to Pedro in Brooklyn  Pedro  Pedro  Hey, O.N.  Good morning  Pedro  Wait, what's the line again?  Pedro  Did you stick your finger in the peanut butter?  In the peanut butter  You know, he's cute 
[01:46:30]  He's a nice guy  I'm in love  Fuck, you put your finger in the peanut butter  Fuck  Yeah, it went old school for some people  Let's say hi to Pedro  Pedro, what's up?  Uh, hi  Uh, O.N.  Uh, let me just go with this and punch out  I did  I did  I did  I really did  More retarded than deaf  But good  Good  Thank you  Very good  And I can't believe you didn't know Sledgehammer  Oh, that was worse  Oh, yeah  I'm on the meat 
[01:47:00]  I'm on  Come on  That is just so wrong  Someone's suggesting  Well, Rochester checking in finally  Rapper's delight there  All W's whip-wop  Is this what her story's about, by the way? 
[01:47:30]  Oh, I forgot  Is it any  Is it even resembling what we're doing here?  What were we talking about?  Oh, yeah  We were talking about a little bit we want to do  Called break  How do you numb  How do you numb the tongue?  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey  Hey, you know that stuff you put on your teeth  When you're  You got a tooth pain?  Mm-hmm  You can put them all over your tongue  Ambasol, huh?  Hello  Like ambasol?  We heard that  What are you, deaf?  You can put that stuff all over your tongue 
[01:48:00]  And it'll do the same exact thing as an overcame  He was all upset that we didn't hear him  Hello  Hello  I have something to say here  And we were answering you and talking to you  You're a douche  Well, Gooch is always good for one  Gooch in Cleveland, what's up?  Oh, Mickey, one of Benny, you don't understand  I don't know why it's got to be the awful 80s tunes  It just works better that way  Yeah, they all play  The songs are just awful 
[01:48:30]  Well, this might work  I like that  I had no clue what it was until the car 
[01:49:00]  Let's go to  It looks like Cameron  Yup, that's me  Because everyone spells Cameron  C-A-M-O-R-N  Camorne  That could mean one thing  Craig is on the phones today  What's up, Camorne?  I got an idea  If you have a chubby bunny karaoke  Chubby bunny karaoke  Do we have any marshmallows?  Yeah, let's  I guess that does make sense  I mean, they get shoving their ears 
[01:49:30]  E-Rock, throw some marshmallows in your mouth  And see if you can sing some Bad 80s song  We want to see if this will work  We'll test it out  We are certainly taking our chances  With the E-Rock marshmallow bit  Good point  Debbie, Rhode Island, what's up?  Have him sing  She blinded me with science  Oh, wow  Just sing it regularly  But have the deaf people just make the sound  Woo, woo, woo  Woo, woo, woo 
[01:50:00]  Oh, boy, we got whole  That's what they're doing, all the noises. 
[01:50:30]  They're doing all the noises, too.  Wait a minute.  If they click today, they might as well go.  Too good.  Too good.  Too good. 
[01:51:00]  I have to fold it.  It's so stupid.  All right, we got a dentist checking in.  We're not giving up on this bit yet.  Jay, the dentist, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  I heard y'all talking about getting the bottom teeth numb.  You get the tongue numb on that side of the face when you do it.  So if you numb up both sides of the face.  Well, we want to do this legally, sir.  That's legal? 
[01:51:30]  What's that?  That's legal.  I don't know how ethical it would be for a dentist to administer Novocaine for a contest.  But I couldn't see it being illegal.  Oh, it's not illegal.  Not at all.  I don't see any problem.  Could be a drastic tongue-biting incident that much.  Hell, let's get a dentist to do this for us.  Yeah.  Yep.  As long as they sign the papers and stuff, I don't see any problems.  Right.  See, there's another show that said, as long as the releases are signed, we're fine. 
[01:52:00]  You're damn right.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Isn't there a part of the brain we can just push Novocaine into that would numb the entire  head?  Can't we just hit him on the side of that with a ball-peen hammer in it?  I think so far marshmallows is...  Marshmallows.  Marshmallows.  But they can choke.  All right.  Listen.  We'll get into the Karen Meyer story, I guess.  That's where it all came from.  That's where it all came from.  That's where it all came from.  That's where it all came from.  She's in Chicago, deaf reporter on the news, and she does this thing called Crip Slam Sundays. 
[01:52:30]  We'll have some audio from that next.  Oh, bitch, it's poetry.  Poetry?  Yeah.  Oh, slam.  Yeah, it could be.  I bet it's just poetry.  Well, it's all sorts of different disabilities, though, so...  And they have to use their disabilities in an artistic way.  It's Crip Slam.  Yeah.  We'll figure it out next.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Virus.  All right.  Good morning. 
[01:53:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA Virus spreading across America, talking about deaf karaoke.  Patrice brought up a very interesting point that they just know 80 songs for whatever reason.  Yeah, for some reason.  I don't know why.  A lot of people are saying...  It just makes it better.  A lot of people are saying we should use hot sauce to numb the tongue, and then we can do deaf karaoke.  I don't think it works as good as Novocaine, that's for sure.  That's why we have the Opie and Anthony Institute.  The Opie and Anthony Labs will try out some things, and we'll bring it to you in the very near future. 
[01:53:30]  We experiment.  But a lot of people, they want to hear one more song, and they're saying, you know, Queen.  I don't know.  Uh...  Uh...  Mama, don't do it to me.  Bo-no-no-no-ne-ne-ne-ne.  Bo-no-no-no-no.  Mama, life is on.  A-no-no.  A-no-no-no. 
[01:54:00]  A-no-no-no.  Mama, mama, mama, mama, do it to me.  Yeah, it's off.  I ain't gonna put a lot.  One-no-no.  Number three.  Number four.  Number three.

[01:59:00]  Wes!  Oh!  You don't know that?  Remember Flash Gordon?  They did the whole thing.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, there are some obscure ones.  Oh, wow.  Oh, God.  Oof. 
[01:59:30]  Let's say hi to Ken in Jersey.  Ken, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  I pulled like seven abdominal muscles.  I can't even think right now.  How about that horrible Celine Dion Titanic song?  We got another good one.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that's, well, that's perfect for today. 
[02:00:00]  Ebony and Ivor.  Yes.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  We might have one more. 
[02:00:30]  Mike from Deer Park.  Mike, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey.  If you're going to have two retards singing together,  you might as well have them sing Paradise by the Dance of the Life.  Oh, forget it, man.  Oh, forget it, man. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, my God.  Man, they're doing it.  Deep down there.  I can see it by the time by the time by the time by the time by the time. 
[02:01:30]  Man, he's on the time by the time to pick him up.  Holy cow, Tony Bates.  Oh, God.  That's why I bow to you.  I bow to Anthony.  Oh, man.  I'm a meatloaf fan.  Oh, boy.  Let's say hi to Joe in Pennsylvania.  Joe, what's up?  Joe?  Joe.  Don't. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, I will always.  Oh, I love you.  Oh, I love you.  That's horrible.  Stop it. 
[02:02:30]  No way.  Oh, I love you.  I know what it is.  Why?  I know what song it is.  Stop the song.  What song?  Baby, I love you.  No.  It's a bit of an emin' day.  It sounds like...  I know you made me, I love you, man.  Really?  Absolutely. 
[02:03:00]  I'm thinking Patience by Goals and Roses.  No.  Baby, I love...  Or a little poison or something.  You know, baby, I love...  Whatever that song is.  Oh, man.  Emin' day.  That start over?  Zero.  That's what song it is.  We've been trying to figure this out for...  This is a deaf person.  I was listening to the music.  It's on YouTube.  Let's do the music.  I can't hear that. 
[02:03:30]  No, no.  You gotta keep going.  I am.  I'm just stopping for a second.  Someone else is saying,  Knock it on Heaven's door.  Knock, knock, knock.  No.  No, there's not enough repetition.  It's Baby, I love...  Whatever that song is.  Baby, I love...  I don't even know what that song is.  You gotta listen to the chorus.  I don't even know what that song is. 
[02:04:00]  I don't even know what that song is.  I don't even know what that song is.  That's sort of music.  What the hell is that? 
[02:04:30]  I'm not sold on Baby, I Love Your Way.  I'm not sold on it, Patrice.  I might be wrong.  I don't know what that is.  Do we know what song that is?  I'm thinking it's Baby, I Love Your Way.  Well, we'll...  I thought I had it.  Wow.  I have no idea.  It might not be it because I was waiting for the chorus, but...  It has that, like, you know, Guns N' Roses unplugged sound.  Is he playing his own guitar? 
[02:05:00]  Does it?  At all?  Well, the guitar...  The guitar is very generic.  Well, maybe, like, kind of...  Kind of, like, generic 80s on part type thing.  And you just...  The power ballad of the 80s.  Yeah.  It's got to be some kind of 80s song, no?  Let's go to Lou.  What's up, Lou?  You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, what's up, man?  I was wondering what it would sound like if Horatio from CSI was deaf.  Oh, yeah!  Dumb.  Yeah, that's what it would sound like. 
[02:05:30]  All you'd hear.  There'd be no funny little statement, nothing.  All right, Dan, what's up?  Think to me, Bank.  I didn't hear a word you did.  What's up, buddy?  I believe I complain.  I believe I complain.  People just enjoy doing it.  I don't know why.  I don't know what's so fun about doing it.  All right, so this.  Someone else is saying it's knocking on heaven's door. 
[02:06:00]  Paul, Staten Island, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  It's definitely knocking on heaven's door.  You can hear knocking on heaven's door in there?  Maybe not the chorus.  But not the chorus, though.  That's what I'm saying.  It's a chorus.  Man, man, man, man, man, man.  I don't know that anymore.  Oh, someone might have the answer.  Thank you, Paul.  I'm thinking of knocking on heaven's door myself until I saw this.  Greg, what's up?  Angie from the Rolling Stones.  That's what it sounds like.  Is the guitar work, Angie? 
[02:06:30]  No, it doesn't sound like that.  Yeah, because he would be screaming.  Let's hear it one more time.  Angie, let me hear it.  I doubt it.  I like that version better anyway.  All right, here it is again.  Someone else is saying Wild Horses by the Stones. 
[02:07:00]  Take it to the Institute and pitch it down.  That is a mystery. 
[02:07:30]  Doesn't sound like any of the songs.  It sounds like it could be like ten different songs.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Do we got a puzzle on our hands.  I know.  It's going to bug me.  It's bugging me right now listening to it.  You know what we're going to do?  We're going to try to figure out what that is tomorrow on the Opie and Anthony show.  How about that?  And we never even got to the catalyst of this whole thing. 
[02:08:00]  We'll do the Karen Meyer thing tomorrow on this side of the show.  We've got lots of other things to do on the other side of the Opie and Anthony show today.  Right.  When we go over to XM's satellite radio.  All right.  Thanks for joining us, guys.  If you're not joining us over at XM, you know, have yourself a great day.  Patrice O'Neill, thank you so much.  Good to be, sir.  What's wrong?  Why the luck?  Nothing.  Black Phillip, Saturday.  Yes.  Yeah.  Over at XM.  Nice.  We're out of here, guys.  Stay in my eye. 
[02:08:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  See you next time. 
[02:09:00]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Thank you. 
[02:09:30]  Thank you. 
[02:10:00]  Thank you. 
[02:10:30]  Thank you. 
[02:11:00]  Thank you. 
[02:11:30]  Thank you.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country. 
[02:12:00]  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd. 
[02:12:30]  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of talent all PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver. 
[02:13:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  You know what I'm saying?  We're important people.  We sure are.  As a humanity on this planet right now.  Right now is a great time to be alive.  Right here.  Right here, right now.  Right here.  Right now.  Right here.  Right now.  That's all relative. 
[02:13:30]  I'm sure they had their shit back in the late 1800s.  They did, but we're not talking about it.  Like Civil War time.  That was a fucking time to live through.  Exactly.  You get what I'm saying.  You lived through that.  What are you trying to say?  I'm just saying.  World War I, World War II, living through that.  Absolutely.  That was a big time.  The in-between shit.  If you were alive during that, who gives a fuck?  The Korean War time from 1950 to 60.  It's like, eh.  60s, huge changes going on.  Technology really starting to take off. 
[02:14:00]  But Vietnam.  I mean, we live in a shitty time.  It's like, I always think we live in a time that like, if you're 85 years old, there's  one day you might be able to say to somebody, you know, I lived when there were pigeons.  Yeah.  There were pigeons.  There were...  Granddad, you knew pigeons?  Yes, I did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, there's a picture of one right there on the hologram.  Wooly mammoths.  The wooly mammoth people are important people.  No, I don't think people live with wooly mammoths, did they?  Yeah, they did. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, they did.  It was important.  That's what I'm saying.  Important.  It's a very important time.  They didn't go away that long ago.  So important they decided to draw some of that shit on the walls and go, look.  Asteroids.  I gotta fucking draw this shit.  I gotta do it.  So the future people will know I was here and fucking...  We found out during our time, Pluto is not a planet.  Right.  I think the biggest thing...  Hold on, hold on.  Before we move on, we are the future people.  Man, are they disappointed.  They gotta be disappointed.  They had these cave drawings, you know, leaving stuff for the future people.  Oh my God. 
[02:15:00]  Imagine what I thought was going on.  And look what we're doing with their future.  No, no, no.  They had high hopes for us.  High hopes.  The future people.  They had high hopes for us in fucking the 50s.  And we're letting them down.  Here's how...  What time we live in.  There are movies that had two years ago as the future time in their movie.  Oh, I know.  Just last night, there was this movie on.  Peter Fonda was...  Yeah, Peter Fonda was in it.  And it was some futuristic movie where they were on Mars. 
[02:15:30]  And there was some kind of vampire thing going on on Mars.  Really awful movie.  But it was 1990.  1990.  The future.  And you're like, oh, why do they do that?  Doesn't that take you right out?  1990.  We didn't even have iPods yet.  I think Aliens was like 2029 or something.  Yeah, like we're catching up on the first Aliens.  That first... 
[02:16:00]  Where's the Nostromo?  Build me that motherfucker.  Do you think that by this time, people would think that there'll be that whole Jetson thing  right now?  Dude, back in, I would say, 1970 or late 60s, early 70s, where I could, like, I started remembering  things.  Like, things meant something to me.  I was becoming like a little person.  Right.  A little brain.  I would think about what the fucking year 2000 and beyond would be, and it sure as shit  wasn't this. 
[02:16:30]  It wasn't cars.  It wasn't 1960 or something now.  It's the same fucking thing.  Me and my girlfriend sitting at a diner one day.  Hold on.  Look up the year 1970.  Let's put this in perspective.  In perspective?  Maybe there are some crazy things that's happened since then.  There are a lot of things.  Great things.  Cable TV.  Sure.  I'm not talking about that, though.  We were looking out the window of a diner, and it was one of these, like, it's a town  where not much changes over the years, so I looked, and there's the bank and the fucking 
[02:17:00]  like stationary store and maybe the different owners every so often, but I'm looking out  the window, and I see like an old telephone pole, and the wires are strong, and I go, you  know something?  Someone could have looked out this fucking window in 1970 and seen the same fucking shit  pretty much the same.  Right out the window.  I go, oh, the cars are different.  They're sleeker and stuff, and the buses are different, but the clothing a little bit  different and stuff, but it's the same. 
[02:17:30]  Look at this motherfucker walking down the sidewalk.  In 1970, some motherfucker was sitting in this diner looking at some motherfucker walk  across the sidewalk.  I'm looking up.  I don't see any spaceships.  I don't see flying cars.  I don't see fucking, you know, we have the ability to fly to other planets.  I thought they would be the biggest invention, and the one I'm waiting for, but the one I  thought would possibly, possibly happen, is a transporter.  The fly.  That's the only thing I'm waiting for.  That's a tough nut to crack. 
[02:18:00]  How the hell are you going to figure that out?  Who the fuck is going to get into that son of a bitch?  You're right, though.  I think...  Who the hell is going to figure that out?  He's right about disappointing.  I think...  That's a hard one.  I think people now, if you zip somebody from 1901 to now, it's almost...  They come running in the room like, I gotta meet the future people, and they meet us?  Jesus.  And it's just the guy from Shawshank Redemption.  Yeah, that's it.  That old man walking around, it's like, oh, wow, things are faster.  I'm gonna go hang myself.  This stinks. 
[02:18:30]  It is like an odd thing.  I think the biggest change, and nothing since, has really been that big.  Computer, I would say, has to be...  Computer's huge.  You know...  Huge.  And that's what right now is all about, and I really think we're at the beginning of it.  It's only been a few years with computers.  I think if you zap somebody from 19...  If you brought somebody from 1901 here, the only thing that they would be astonished by is computers.  No.  No, flying.  Fucking flight is the biggest thing ever to ever happen to humanity. 
[02:19:00]  Going from nothing to the Reichsburg brothers, to fucking jet aircraft, winging you across  the country, and fucking...  I'll tell you why I disagree.  Why, sir?  I disagree with the plane.  That's not the biggest invention.  Birds.  Biggest.  Dodo Birds.  It's amazing.  Dodo Birds.  Birds.  He really has 80, then you go, I don't give a shit.  No, I'm listening.  I want to hear...  Here's why I don't think...  Wait, do you think planes will be... 
[02:19:30]  Are the biggest...  I don't think...  Fucking...  I'll tell you why I don't think so.  And turn me on that, yeah.  Flight is the biggest thing to ever happen to human beings.  I'll tell you why I disagree for this reason.  Okay.  Now you...  Why I agree...  I think computers are.  You don't have to fly to learn about the world.  Computers have made the planet...  But no one's learning about the world with computers.  Computers have made the planet...  Accessible.  Just smaller.  Like even...  Even this so-called...  This celebrity thing. 
[02:20:00]  This entertainment thing.  I...  You know, I'm on MySpace and what's tripping me out is like, okay, I'll get a MySpace thing  like, hey, you fat fucker.  You don't answer me back.  Hey, fuck you.  And this, that, and the third.  So I'm sitting there like, why am I mad at this?  Why?  Because...  And of course, I'm not comparing myself to the dude.  But let's say, Cary Grant, people sent things in the mail and crossed their fingers hoping  that a man that they thought was better than them would send them something back.  Would write him a fucking signed picture. 
[02:20:30]  They did not go, fuck you, you asshole.  People weren't that comfortable.  And I think computers made the world less...  You're...  It just...  Everybody's just conglomerate.  Yeah, but...  You know what, though?  It's just a better way of doing something that had been done for so fucking long.  The town crier, the fucking message guy that used to run and give the message to people  and then they'd give something else back. 
[02:21:00]  It's like...  It's a great...  I mean, of course, flight is fantastic, but...  But like, flight, all of a sudden, you have the ability to take a fucking army and drop  it somewhere, and it's only because of flight.  Like, flight, you can grab...  You can now...  Instead of looking at a picture of someplace far away that you would never be able to get  to, you fly there.  You're fucking getting somewhere in five hours.  You're going coast to coast.  I think any invention that...  There are inventions that make things convenient, right? 
[02:21:30]  Planes change the way things are, but I think it's not that important if you still  could have did what you wanted to do now.  They had war during fucking 1401.  I know, but think of it in terms of...  I know what makes things better.  Think of it in terms of bringing someone from the past.  You're taking someone from 1900 and bringing them to right now.  Right.  You show them the computer and say, look at all this information.  They'd be like, wow, that is a lot of information.  And it's, holy fuck, what is that? 
[02:22:00]  It's in the sky and it's flying.  Wait a minute, but I think they'll still go, holy fuck, if, like on Pal Talk, if you push  a button and this motherfucker looks at you and go, hey, and you go, can you...  This old guy in spats jerking off.  Yeah, can you show me your titty?  And she goes, right on time, when you're talking in this device, and you see...  That's magical.  But even back then, they had fucking, you know...  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. 
[02:22:30]  Show me your titty.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  And then, blip, show me your titty.  Stop.  Need to see your nipples.  Stop.  Like they had forms of communication.  The flight thing is something that if you brought someone from the past to the future, that would  be the single most amazing fucking thing they would see.  I understand technology with the computer is fascinating, and especially to us, and I  think it's one of those things that kind of...  Well, in context of us right now, would you say... 
[02:23:00]  So you're saying in context of someone in the past?  You're saying in context of somebody in the past?  I'm still amazed by computers and what they're coming out with.  I'm not amazed as much by flight.  For us, though, you think that planes are more important than computers, or you're saying  if you brought people from the past to say, whoa, the most amazing thing...  They would be way more amazed by planes in the sky.  Right now, we take for granted planes.  We take it for granted.  We've always lived with planes.  Sometimes it hits you when you're on a plane.  You go, this is a motherfucking miracle. 
[02:23:30]  I am fucking hurtling through the cosmos at 500 miles an hour, and I'm going to be...  I think people bring someone back from the dead that never saw a flight.  No.  Never been on a plane.  You throw them on a plane, they're not going to be...  I'll tell you why.  You think they're going to be more freaked out by a computer?  I have another argument.  No way.  All right, Patrice.  I have another argument.  Willing to sit and listen.  Pass the joint, by the way.  More pot talk.  Love it.  All right.  I think the concept of man flying is amazing, but the concept of flight isn't. 
[02:24:00]  So I think that if you're a caveman or whoever you were back then, and you looked at things  and you knew that, okay, Isaac Newton was, what, 16 something?  Yes.  So he saw birds.  They knew of scientific reasoning for why birds flew.  They knew scientifically why and how things fly. 
[02:24:30]  And I think all it was, it was a matter of figuring out how to pull it off and be a bird.  So we was trying to think about being birds.  I think computers, no one ever sat and conceptualized the idea of what a computer is, to take all the  information, these millions and millions of miles or whatever the fuck you call them, megabytes of  information, put it through.  And also, real time, take that information through wires and through chips and all that. 
[02:25:00]  I think that that came along.  I don't think they were sitting in a, I think people been imagining a flight.  And I think if you brought somebody back from 18 something, they'll go, wow, somebody finally  did it, man.  Figure that shit out.  I knew that was going to happen because we just always dreamt about it, but no one dreamt  about blah, blah, blah, LOL.  Well, computers were kind of like, even when computers were understood by a lot of people  and, and available, limited, but to certain people, people thought the first thing was 
[02:25:30]  like, well, it's cool and all, but what the hell is the average Joe going to do with a  computer?  And, and there were people that would say, we're saying, uh, uh, computers will end up in  everyone's home.  And you sit there and go, why would I need a fucking computer?  And now you do not function without one.  It is, it is your line to, uh, learn things to fight.  If you got one of those stupid questions, remember, it was like, who is the actor in  that movie?  And you'd sit there all night going, who the fight would bug the shit out of you.  And now you go, I am DC. 
[02:26:00]  And like the information is there at your fingertips.  And that's something that kind of progressed.  And the people, I think people themselves threw all that info on it.  It wasn't Mr. Computer that said, here's all the information we need to put on computers.  And the thing we're not talking about with flight, going to the moon.  You don't think someone coming back from the dead would be like, by the way, we've been  to the moon.  We decided to rocket ship ourselves up to the fucking moon.  Although it was all made up.  Hollywood sounds.  It was all fake.  Well, you know, because the flag, you know, there's no wind. 
[02:26:30]  I think, I think the, I think it's the progression.  It's the progression that makes us take it for granted.  It's like, like flight, flight.  You were saying you'd look at the bird and go at that.  It's the progression of the manipulation of science though, Anthony, I think just like  the submarine, the invention of it is fantastic.  But the concept, it's, it's, it's the, it's the manipulation of, of the, of what's given  to us.  The computer is an actual, but that was also something that kind of, like, uh, ground basing 
[02:27:00]  for a fucking computer.  There's no nature thing that says, okay, one day I'll have this machine that just came out  of necessity because we had to figure shit out faster than people could with pencils and  paper.  Right.  So they decided let's fucking invent something that does this.  And it kind of progressed into what it is.  Flight was kind of, you know, the Wright brothers powered flight.  And then it progressed pretty quickly to something else again at a necessity. 
[02:27:30]  But if you took somebody that never saw, they might think, well, we'd put wings on a guy and  he'd be in fast motion on top of a rock and he'd jump off and fall on his face.  I love that clip.  But then when you think, all right, we're shoving 500 motherfuckers in this tube, we call  it a 747 and there's things called turbine jet engines and the thrust flies out of it,  it would freak people out.  Right.  And while you're sitting in your comfy seat, you get a beverage and you drink it and you're 
[02:28:00]  not fucking holding on for dear life going, ah!  And they would be freaked out too that blacks and whites would be on the same plane sitting  wherever they want.  Some people are still kind of freaked out by that, ah, flying places.  Flying places.  Flying places together?  What?  That's great.  You're flying with your slave?  How is this at all possible?  Oh, Jesus.  They allow them to fly?  It took us three and a half hours, Patrice, you know.  You must be able to bring thousands over in a clip. 
[02:28:30]  Much faster than those ships we use.  We must be getting along with you.  It took three and a half hours today.  Which actually, the old days, I used to do this video when I first started, first started  comedy about why slavery's not around.  Just because I always just believe this country's so racist that if it could be slavery, it would.  But it's like, what the facts this nigger.  It's like, there's no need for slavery.  Once technology came, it was just like, how do I have a fucking slave? 
[02:29:00]  You know what?  How can I justify having a slave?  Right, right.  Hey, could you fucking find this plug for my iPod?  Yeah.  You don't have to lift anything anymore.  So, oh, fuck.  God, go home.  Whip you in the back.  Wah!  Thanks, this nigger.  Okay, sir.  I gotta hobble him.  He might take off.  No!  Where's he going?  That's really funny.  Oh, my God.  Thank you, Sam. 
[02:29:30]  Jesus.  Well, I mean, I'm not...  Oh, you know, you gotta...  That's a compelling argument, sir.  You know, who...  It's possible.  What would be...  I think the computer myself is very...  It's like, amazing, but...  Until we bring somebody back from back then and ask them.  How about cell phones?  No.  It's just another...  Like you said, it's a progression.  Beep, beep, beep, beep.  It's another...  Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep.  Communication device.  Someone comes back from the dead and...  Fucking...  It's smoke signals.  And you explain to them, you could reach anyone, anywhere, anytime? 
[02:30:00]  Well, that's pretty bizarre to some people.  Well, you have to go back, actually, to the phone, though, Obie, to...  You have to be impressed with the...  Yeah, I understand.  ...with the concept of it.  And then it elevates.  Watson, come quick.  I need you.  Remember that fucking Alexander Graham Bell shit?  The first...  So, I mean, once that concept, when you go from can and string, two cans and a piece of string,  and you go, oh, shit.  Once that becomes something and the phone's like, oh, shit, it all elevates from there. 
[02:30:30]  Everyone starts thinking, where is this going?  Where is it going?  The second a technology hits, you think, all right, where is this going to be in 10 years,  20 years, 30 years?  I think...  And why do we have to start with beepers, by the way?  Those four cell phones.  Those fucking pages.  Can they figure that out?  Why couldn't they just jump to the cell phone?  Was it you?  That's very suspicious right there.  Was it you or you that was saying you think...  It might have been you.  Really?  I said something?  It might have been you.  What happened?  I think you said...  I don't know.  But you said you think that everything is already done. 
[02:31:00]  Oh.  And they're slowly introducing each thing because it's overload to give us actually what  is out there.  Yeah, that's...  If you take any economic course, they talk about that.  Like, we could have been doing the high def years ago, but they wanted to sell us the  big TVs, the rear projection TVs, then the flat screens, and now finally high def.  So they already got the whole thing already.  They were ready with high def years ago.  I think in the labs and stuff, they got that shit, but I don't think they're ready for 
[02:31:30]  the consumers.  That's why they cost $14,000 when they first came out.  You know what?  Someone can help me out.  I haven't been in college in five, six years now.  Basically, there's something to do with...  Someone will help me out.  They have this technology, but they want to sell a certain amount.  Then they realize the market's dying, let's say, as far as rear projection.  Then they move on to the next technology to get everyone buying new shit again.  And it's an economic term, and I don't know it right now. 
[02:32:00]  But without technology, would somebody be demanding high def?  Like, let's say they just gave us rear projection, and that's just what they gave us.  That was it.  Would people be demanding, you know what?  I want something better.  You know what?  I think that's what happened.  I think it's like people got rear projection, and it's like, why the fuck am I watching a TV  that is fucking six feet long, sticking off of my wall?  Is there a way we can make a TV that is flat? 
[02:32:30]  I want a flat fucking television.  And for years, they were not able to do that.  Not with a cathode ray tube that has to be fucking long enough to shoot the fucking ray  to the front of the screen.  It has something to do with economics as well.  You're right, but it also has something to do with economics as well.  They have it figured out.  I'm telling you.  And then after a while, I wouldn't doubt that they do have these things and hold them back,  but I don't think they've had them for very long.  They hold back the technology.  I don't think they have the capability of holding them back very long, these ideas. 
[02:33:00]  Before they get out, people are fucking nosy and gabby.  I think, yeah, they had plasma TVs before they were announced.  Shit like that.  There's a term, I'm telling you.  We'll get through screwing the public.  I just think we're living a great time, man.  Let's go to Georgia and New York.  The end of the world.  The way shit's going to run.  I hope it all ends in a big white flash.  Some fucking nutty Arab decides to blow it all up, live through that, could sit with  each other and just go, as our hair clumps are falling out from radiation, our teeth are 
[02:33:30]  falling out.  Just have one last drink and go, wasn't this great?  We made it to the end.  To the end.  Where the fuck?  All the shit that happened before us.  Can you imagine?  The first fucking little piece of protoplasm that split and decided to become a human.  All that ends right now with one more toast as our teeth fall out and our hair falls out  and our eyes bleed and we look at the flash.  It is the end.  That's what I, you get what I'm saying.  Everyone wants to be part of the end of the tree. 
[02:34:00]  It's a shitty time.  You don't want to be in the middle somewhere.  We're at the end.  Let's be at the end.  We're at the fucking end.  Push, if you're listening, push the button.  You know, sonny, I was around with the last pigeon.  Oh, why are you?  Planned obsolescence.  Oh.  Planned obsolescence.  Google that.  Where they know something's going to be obsolete.  It's a planned thing.  It's just kind of a placeholder.  But why would an 8-track tape be obsolete? 
[02:34:30]  Why would I need not to have an 8-track tape anymore?  Because cassettes, you could fit a lot more in your car.  Because all of a sudden they show you, look, cassettes, and you could fast forward and  rewind them.  And no, you don't throw out all your 8-tracks.  The 8-tracks became shit.  Everyone's saying planned obsolescence.  That's right.  George, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Hey.  I'd have to agree with Patrice on this whole topic because, you know, Anthony, you bring  up a lot of good points, but there was a lot of science, you know, and a lot of people 
[02:35:00]  could predict that we're going to be flying.  But the computers and stuff, man, that's like, you know, out of this, you know, nobody even  had a concept of that stuff.  Yeah, because like I said, it was kind of built out of this necessity to figure shit out  faster.  It wasn't built for, hey, everyone's going to have one of these and we're going to make  something called the internet.  And it's just going to be people that have this common place, this virtual place to talk 
[02:35:30]  and trade ideas and porno, whatever the fuck you want.  Like it came out of guys and usually the military because, you know, we got to figure these codes  out, these fucking codes.  And we got this guy sitting here with a pencil and paper trying to figure codes out.  I got a machine and it could do it a little faster.  And from that, it just kind of kept going.  I read another interesting article on technology and they say when this new technology comes  out, we've talked about this on the show before.  One of the main uses at first is for pornography. 
[02:36:00]  Porno, yeah.  Always for porno.  And then they decide, wow, all right, we got that out of the way.  What else could this thing do?  That's usually public consumption first.  The printing, yeah, of course.  Like the printing press and all that.  It was all about writing just the dirtiest stories ever in the beginning and then they  finally go, okay, let's do something useful as well.  I think most of the technology we have comes from the art of killing each other.  We get most of our technology from war.  When we make war, the need to win makes us really come to the fucking table and invent 
[02:36:30]  some real cool shit that then later gets used for hanging out and having fun.  I have to disagree with that too.  Not that you're making a point to disagree with, but I had this concept of why we have  technology.  Don't tell me it's for the good of humankind.  I think the basis for it is laziness.  Laziness?  Each invention is based on laziness. 
[02:37:00]  Someone's got to get off their ass and invent it.  But that's what I'm saying.  And each relevant invention, you don't need the plane to exist in this world.  It was made to make things quicker and easier to do.  You don't need escalators.  You don't need umbrellas.  You don't need shoehorns.  You don't need anything really to exist.  You don't need a car.  I can get to where I got to go.  I can get to 195th Street without a car, but it's a lot easier.  I agree with you. 
[02:37:30]  Usually it's one guy, though, or a couple of guys, a team that decides, like, the Wright  brothers.  Powered flight.  Right.  That had been a concept before.  And then they decided to refine it.  And they actually pulled it off.  Right.  The second they did that, it became this thing that the military kind of looked at.  Like, they were trying to sell it to the military too.  And, like, all right, here we go.  And they made it something like, holy shit, we can kill a lot of motherfuckers.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Do you think the plane, if it was just strictly for transporting lazy people that didn't want 
[02:38:00]  to get in a covered wagon or a car or something, they decided, look, we can kill so many more  people now with this fucking plane.  It's amazing.  Build me a shitload and put a space where I could fit bombs in them.  Now, this is a question, like you said, pod talk.  Is the person, is there a person that had the patent on the umbrella?  Is there someone, are the Wright brothers' kids getting paid for the plane? 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, they are.  Yeah.  The Wright brothers had a shitload of fucking patents.  Yeah.  And so they're.  Like, pieces of the planes they got patented.  Their family's getting, whoever their family, they're getting paid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're still getting paid.  Amazing.  Hey, let's go to Damon in Cleveland.  What's up, Damon?  Hey, Opie, you're right about, like, holding back technology.  I've seen it firsthand.  My wife works in research.  It's like, in the medicine companies, like, say, you're the first person to come out with  a certain medicine.  You will go out, go along and pay other companies not to build the same medicine cheaper. 
[02:39:00]  And they can actually do that.  My wife's seen it with different medicines.  And I'm pretty sure they do the same thing with, like, technology, like the first person  to build, like, say, a DVD, for instance.  You'll pay your competitors to back off or slow down just to make sure it's because you  have the patent on it first.  You follow what I'm saying?  Well, there's a lot of that stuff that's going on.  When I was back in college in the late, you know, 1900s there, I read a book.  It was from a senator.  He was the senator of Hawaii.  And they figured out that we are so behind with the stuff we know, we should have been 
[02:39:30]  way more advanced.  But they slow things down for economic reasons and other reasons, maybe for, you know, competitors  and all that as well.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I think when push comes to shove and it's in the country's best interest because, like,  people are beating the shit out of us or something, then you come up with things like  the atomic bomb.  Like, that whole war, World War II, was like, you know something?  This is big.  Like, this is a big fucking war. 
[02:40:00]  Why did we go to the moon?  Beat the Soviet Union.  Yeah, just because it was the Cold War.  That was because of the Cold War, to show them, look, that's the ultimate fucking high  ground.  And then what happens is all the technology that comes out of it that, you know, building  the ship, you know, plastics that they came up with and shit like that.  So then all this new technology comes out of it, but that wasn't the reason they did  it initially.  Right.  It was to show our dicks.  Initially, it's, wow, why are they beating the fuck out of this guy on television?  Imagine, holy Jesus Christ, it's a crowd of people just pounding someone with sticks. 
[02:40:30]  Just when you think, we're talking about technology and going to the moon, and they're just showing  people in Africa beating people with sticks.  This planet is amazing.  It is just this fucking smorgasbord.  We're talking about the greatest invention in the world.  Yeah.  Show these motherfuckers an airplane, and they freak out.  And they're still doing old school crucifixions.  Old school fucking machete to the top of the head.  Whack.  God damn, man.  All right, we're going to step aside.  We've got to get an update on squirrels. 
[02:41:00]  Can we eat squirrels?  Yeah, we'll explain next, Patrice.  And I want to know if any of the guys got any other things they're going to do with  the vaginas.  Oh, yeah.  We're doing a thing called Your Vaginas Got Talent.  So Your Vaginas Got Talent.  See, you know what?  That's what it means.  So Your Vaginas Got Talent.  Can I please come in for that?  Oh, absolutely.  Everyone's saying that.  Blowing balloons up.  I've seen so many things on the internet, girl.  Shooting eggs.  All right, I'll explain that next, and maybe you can help the guys with some of the things 
[02:41:30]  you've seen before, all right?  Trying to think the craziest.  Guys have come up with some great ideas.  Cigarette smoke.  My favorite so far is Danny's.  Yeah, let's hold it right here.  I'm going to ask this question to the members of the panel here.  What is the craziest thing you've seen a vagina do?  Ours will probably be very similar.  Very similar, yeah.  Let's think it over, though, for a couple minutes here.  Well, Bill, that was your cue.  Yeah, Bill.  Figure it out whenever you want.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:42:00]  It's the O.B. and Anthony Girls.  You're home for good, clean, wholesome family entertainment.  Wow.  That is such a long way to go just to say.  Oh, it's the O.B. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, it's the O.B.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Thank you, Anthony.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, boy. 
[02:43:00]  The pod talk continues.  Dan, what's your line again?  Dan had a great line during the break about what we were discussing, bringing people back from the past.  And showing them, like, cool stuff.  Cool stuff.  And what would they most be amazed at?  Yeah.  I said the airplane.  Patrice argued that it would be the computer.  You know, all valid points, and it's all hypothetical.  I said the yo-yo, by the way.  The yo-yo would definitely be up there.  A little off, I guess.  But, Dan, what did you say about that?  I said if you brought somebody from the past to the future, the invention they'd most be amazed by was the time machine. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  You know, none of us idiots even thought of that.  It's like, yeah, you bring them back.  A few years ago, hey, look at this plane.  And meanwhile, he's going, wait, fuck the flying machine.  Yeah.  How did you get me here?  Right.  I was fucking in a Conestoga wagon.  Yeah.  And then we went further.  It's like we keep saying if we could bring someone back from the dead.  Oh, yeah.  That would be what they would be amazed by.  Yeah.  Because they'd be like, wait a minute.  I was in a bed, really sick.  My family was around me. 
[02:44:00]  Things started slowly fading out, and now what?  And you're showing me internet pornography is what you're calling it?  What is this?  Now you come back, Frankenstein dead.  We brought you back from the dead, but everyone you knew is dead.  Why did you bring me back?  To settle a little bet.  Right.  Not even a bet we were having.  Just a discussion.  So we decided to bring you back.  Yes, your entire family, your daughter, your grandchildren, all dead. 
[02:44:30]  Nothing but lonely holidays for you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But what are you most amazed by?  Yeah, right.  God, we really are smoking pot today.  What is wrong with us?  It's a very deep conversation.  Speaking of technology, you guys know what leet speak is?  Leet speak, of course.  Yes.  You see it every day.  Mm-hmm.  Online.  A lot of the gamers use it all elite speak.  You know what elite speak is.  You just didn't know what it was.  Pwned is elite speak. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, you just didn't know what it was called, leet speak.  You don't spell it with the E's either.  Please use threes.  It's L, three, three, three, three, T, T, and there are other variations.  You're an elite motherfucker.  You're elite.  Leet.  It's usually some fucking fuck-headed dork bag playing a computer game.  Yes?  Yes?  Oh.  Ugh. 
[02:45:30]  Wow.  Ugh.  That was primal.  Fuck me.  Can I show you an airplane, sir?  Thank you, Gail, from White Plains.  At least maybe we'll get their audio.  Remember we said we wanted to interview crazy chick Sarah Goldberg?  Of course we did.  Crazy chick Sarah Goldberg from American Idol is going to be on Channel 5 here in New York in minutes.  About to be interviewed.  Can we change the channel, Leet?  Where?  Put it on.  Put it on.  Put it on.  Oh, my God.  How do you work this remote?  Oh, don't even try.  All right.  Oh, look at me. 
[02:46:00]  I need that one changed.  I'll do that one.  Thank you.  We love this.  There she is.  Oh, Christ.  She's on already.  The world is sleeping.  I stay up and think of you.  How bad is this?  This chick is nuts.  And I wish on a star that somewhere you are.  Why couldn't we get her on our show?  Are people laughing?  Oh, my God.  They're laughing.  Because I'm dreaming of you tonight till tomorrow. 
[02:46:30]  They're fucking laughing in the background.  No, she's not.  She's bipolar.  She's the one that lost it on American Idol last week.  In the world I'd rather be.  I think they're probably not supposed to be hearing it.  Fuck.  They got her.  We wanted her.  So what do you think?  What do you think?  Do you think you're your...  I think you got a lot of sparks, sister. 
[02:47:00]  And I got to tell you, I think it was better.  I did, too.  Come on over here.  Come on over here.  Come on over here.  This is that new morning show that is like an SNL skit.  You're going to Hollywood, you're going to Bayonne, New Jersey.  But, no, I mean, I think it's a big improvement.  Oh, no, don't turn on me.  You're sending her.  I think there was an improvement.  And you're telling me that if she practices enough with you, maybe by the next year, go  back after it again.  They got her a vocal coach.  Will she have the spirit?  If she works really hard, I think we can do it. 
[02:47:30]  We're going to give you some vocal lessons.  And they're not interviewing her right.  I'm out for her.  We would interview her until she goes nuts.  Thank you, Jordan, very much.  Who's that audience?  Wow.  Thank you.  You're a good sport.  It's hard to get up here.  Trust me.  I sang karaoke the first couple of days.  Can we do it then?  No, we don't think so.  This isn't the angle.  We had the machine removed from the studio.  That's how badly nobody would do it.  This isn't that SNL, one of those talk show skits.  Sir, you're a good sport.  You are.  Very good sport.  Good sport.  See, they don't want to piss her off because they know she's bipolar. 
[02:48:00]  Ah, fuck you.  Stupid news.  That's not the angle with her.  She's nuts.  Why don't you bring up the fact she's got bipolar?  She's nuts.  It's a new talk show.  Look at the audience they had to drag in.  They were just like off the street people.  That's the John McEnroe audience.  All right.  Yeah, leet speak there.  Yeah, leet.  16-year-old Niles Geron uses leet speak, a type of online lingo that's growing in popularity  with teens.  All my friends use leet speak. 
[02:48:30]  I can see about why parents will be worried just because it can lead to danger.  And that's exactly why Internet safety experts are sounding a warning.  The language is morphing into a dangerous dialect foreign to parents.  Scott Dollison is a cyber detective for the Westerville Police Department.  This gives criminals, kids, whomever, another way to communicate covertly with one another  without, you know, parents may be catching on to what the kids are saying. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, I see.  Kids being kids.  I've been pwned and I don't know what it means.  What does it mean when I've been pwned?  Ken from Jersey.  I've been pwnended.  Ken from Jersey.  One, three, three, seven, leet, faggots.  Yeah.  But they say it's a problem because it's a new language that parents can't understand.  Can't understand.  Oh, stop it.  Stupid.  Who cares if they can't understand what people are saying on Counter-Strike? 
[02:49:30]  That's pretty much where it's used.  Leet is short for e-leet because it's common for more advanced computer users.  There are online dictionaries and translators to help parents decipher some of the information.  Experts say if you don't know leet-speak, you'll be in the dark.  Sometimes it seems like every day something new is popping up with the Internet.  But, yeah, I mean, it's something you really have to focus on and stay on top of to be effective.  Niles' mom, Rosanna, was shocked to learn how creative and cryptic elite-speak has become. 
[02:50:00]  Her advice?  Get involved with your child and try to stay, you know, stay in the loop of what's going on.  It moves really fast.  What is this LOL I'm seeing?  Is this a new drug?  Are you taking LOL?  Are you hanging out with some Puerto Rican named Lull?  Who's this black magic woman?  What is that LOL?  Fucking Kevin Meaney.  He'll do this bit in 30 years. 
[02:50:30]  Nothing?  That's pretty funny.  I've noticed he types BRB and then goes to the bathroom.  We are the children.  Still doing the fucking bit.  That's, oh, whatever.  I've seen that motherfucker get 10 standing ovations 10 years ago.  He had new material for one year and he's been doing the same bit since.  God bless him, man.  It got old after the first year and that didn't stop him. 
[02:51:00]  All right.  Yeah, snatches and squirrels.  Okay.  What do you want to do?  Snatches?  Because coming to the show, we got So Your Vagina's Got Talent.  Let's say hi to Brad.  Brad, what's the craziest thing you've seen a vagina do?  Hey, what's up, boys?  What's up, Patrice?  How are you?  I'm doing all right.  The nastiest thing I've seen out here in Korea, up north by the DMZ, they got this show  where this broad will put like a roll of quarters up her stink box. 
[02:51:30]  And then she goes around to the tables and she asks you how much change you want.  If you say 75 cents, she pops out three quarters.  That's pretty fucking amazing.  How the fuck did she figure that out?  That's pretty amazing.  Yeah.  Those fucking, those pussy muscles are great, man.  We don't, we just don't understand the pussy muscles.  It's amazing.  Those, those things, those things.  I think the fact that it bleeds once a month on cue and then stops and there's not even  a wound. 
[02:52:00]  It's pretty scary.  The fact that nobody shoots them every month, it just bleeds for no reason.  Officer 911?  Someone is calling my son a fucktard noob.  Is he on the dope?  He's on the dope.  What's a noob?  Is that like a boob?  Is he sexually active?  Fucktard.  Let's go to Xander.  Xander.  Hey, how's it going, boys? 
[02:52:30]  Hey, buddy.  Hey, I dated this girl back in college who you could, she was really stupid.  I could convince her to do anything.  And a friend of mine said he convinced his girlfriend to put a toothbrush up her pussy.  Jeez.  So I thought like, I mean, the girl's a gymnast, like all through high school, so we kind  of tried it out and she was able to put a toothbrush in her pussy with toothpaste and  like brush her teeth, bending over really hard.  Maybe that's what they were like, giving her a hint or something.  Yeah, right?  I think a girl would get a little angry at that.  Could you put a toothbrush and toothpaste up your pussy? 
[02:53:00]  I don't even want to look.  Let's go to Rich in Portland.  Rich?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Uh, craziest thing I've seen back in 90 and 91, I was in Okinawa and, uh, I also heard  a quarters trick, but she did two other tricks with it.  She started off late on her back and put a ping pong ball up her pussy and you're wondering  what the hell, boom, shoots it out like 15 feet at you.  And then, uh, she does the quarters trick and then she'll put a, afterwards, put a peeled 
[02:53:30]  banana out there and slice it into pieces and you get drunk brains to catch it in her mouth.  There you go.  Slice a banana in the pussy?  Yeah.  Wow.  Slice, slice it up with her muscles.  This mother, you, how can you slice a banana with your muscles?  Like, that's like saying you can slice it, squeezing off a shit.  But that's like, but that's like, it's like squeezing off a shit.  Oh, I see.  Well, you know what?  You know, I'll take, I apologize for what I was getting ready to say.  Yeah, I don't think it's an actual slice. 
[02:54:00]  But I'm thinking, um, symmetrical slices.  Yeah, like coins.  You're like saying squishes, small pieces.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  I thought it meant slicing.  Yeah.  Like, so you put on cereal.  Fucking Paulie garlic with the fucking razor blade and Goodfellas thin.  Getting nice slices out.  Nice thin slices.  No, it's a mess of a slice.  Well, it looks like a fucking piece of shit.  So the craziest thing we've seen a pussy do.  I got three. 
[02:54:30]  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Well, I got to go with one, the bottle rocket.  The bottle rocket from a girl's pussy.  Shooting a bottle rocket out of a pussy.  Fourth of July.  That's a terrific video.  The cigarette smoking pussy.  Saw that.  It's complete with smoke rings.  Terrific video.  That was amazing.  And then the cell phone.  Cell phone amazing.  Cell phone up the pussy.  Although it did not work.  Although we couldn't go.  We ought to try that again.  You know why?  Cell phones are better.  Cell phones are smaller and better. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  Maybe we can do that for, um.  So your vagina's got talent.  Your vagina's got talent.  Perhaps we can shove someone's cell phone up there, give it a call, and see if we get  a signal inside a vagina.  You forgot about the girl that threw eggs from her.  Right.  That was amazing.  And threw it at a blind guy.  That was probably the most amazing thing we've seen a vagina do.  She slung it.  She launched vaginas, uh, Patrice, from her, from her egg.  Back in the old days.  I mean, she had to use her hips and stuff.  On the old show, right?  She had to use her hips and stuff, but she got it done. 
[02:55:30]  That's amazing.  You said she launched vaginas.  Oh, did I see?  I told you.  I'm, I'm a little, uh, a little out of it.  What about an eel?  The eel.  You seen that one?  Yeah.  You haven't seen that?  Yeah.  So you said you have suggestions for the guys.  Here's the deal.  The guys behind the scenes are, uh, what is the cash prize?  We're going to put up some money.  Oh, I don't know.  We got a, a who, uh, coming in and they're all going to do things with her vagina.  See?  You would think that the girl had to do something.  There were going to be a bunch of girls and it was going to be a competition of what they  could do with their vaginas, but no.  That might be the next step.  It is.  So, so your vagina's got talent. 
[02:56:00]  The guys have to figure out the best way to utilize the vagina that makes us go, wow,  that's creative and talented.  Oh, okay.  Now, Danny's, which I liked, uh, the best, uh, if he could figure this out, he's a genius.  He wants to do some type of, of a Rube Goldberg thing where it's, you know, one of those contraptions  where a marble goes into a funnel, falls onto a little teeter-totter that hits the boot,  the boot kicks the bowling ball, it goes down.  And then-  Like dominoes. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  It hits some dominoes, which then hits a spoon, it flips it up, it does.  And then, at the end, is a finger, which then goes into the vagina.  That's the payoff.  That's all the payoff.  After all this contraption, this finger, like a rubber finger will go bloop and stick right  in her pussy.  And if it all works, that would be magnificent.  What a payoff.  After all that, the payoff is just a-  The payoff is, oh, wait a minute.  Nope.  Is he coming in with the finger? 
[02:57:00]  There it is.  Oh, he's got the finger.  So he's got the last part of the puzzle.  All right, he's got the finger.  He's just got to, like, work backwards now.  How about-  Backwards.  A machine that runs on pussy power.  How-  Like-  Well, okay.  Wait a minute.  To solve the world's energy problems.  A girl that has powerful enough pussy muscles to shoot enough air out to-  Turn a window?  Give enough energy to something to light a light bulb.  Oh, my God.  If she can do it, though. 
[02:57:30]  See, we're working with one broad here.  If you've got a girl that could queef into a windmill that would generate electricity and  light up a little light bulb-  That would be huge.  Vagina power.  Ben?  Ben's got a mic in front of him.  That's good.  What's up?  Well, I was-  The one thought I had, because you had mentioned that using the, sort of the Mentos and Diet  Coke thing, that it would be kind of like a rocket.  Yeah.  I was thinking if we-  As long as we create some sort of device to make sure it does not go farther in her- 
[02:58:00]  Uh-huh.  With something with flaps, you know, that would- is to actually try to put her on a skateboard  and try to propel her with the force.  The thrust.  If we could make that happen.  That would be needed.  This is a brainstorming session.  I'm just throwing stuff out.  I love it, but it ain't happening.  I think any mixture that would propel her forward would explode her.  I don't mean-  It would break those flaps.  Or shoot across the room if she goes one mile an hour.  I even mean, like, just moving her. 
[02:58:30]  I think the pressure that would need to come out of her vagina would be enough where the  vaginal canal itself would expand and you'd get no power out of that.  You'd blow her fucking pussy apart.  Fair enough.  How about-  You see a pussy come apart like that.  How about which pussy could make the best Long Island iced tea?  There's only one pussy.  It's only one pussy.  This is one girl coming in.  All the guys have to use one identical pussy and their idea has to be the best. 
[02:59:00]  She makes-  You bring in-  You have a Long Island iced tea made by a reputable bartender.  Bartender pussy.  And you put it next to her.  Then you pour all the ingredients in her vagina.  If she can mix them and it tastes exactly like a wonderful Long Island iced tea.  Call it cunt tail.  Cunt tail.  Wow.  That's a good one. 
[02:59:30]  All right.  Any other ideas the guys are coming up with?  Rocket propelled pussy.  Wow.  Well, the one other, and again, this is just the broad strokes, is somehow putting a post in both orifices and then creating some sort of slingshot.  Oh, interesting.  I'm not sure what the end game is there.  You stick some kind of elastic thing with two Benoit ball type things, maybe. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  One up her ass, one in the pussy, which would leave a sling for something.  Yeah.  And then you could slap her taint with it.  Yeah, we were thinking, like, maybe paper football.  Oh, right, right, right.  Holy cow.  All right, well, they're thinking.  They're thinking these things out.  We got James Hansen from South Dakota.  Have a chick shave a Hitler mustache, jam a microphone in her twat, and transmit one of Adolf's inspiring speeches from her hoo-ha while she manipulates her lips to stimulate the mouth. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, to simulate the Hitler mouth?  Simulate, right.  I said stimulate.  Interesting.  Simulate the mouth.  Yeah.  That leaves a little too much on her.  Yeah.  You got to, the guys have to kind of come up with it.  That's why the Rube Goldberg thing is so cool.  I like that.  All right.  Well, we're working on that in the lab still.  And the ass is in.  In play?  Have we figured out if the ass is in play? 
[03:01:00]  It's small detail, not the main event.  Like a sidekick to your...  An anchor point, a support.  Yeah.  Sure.  A supporting role.  I'll be clear with her, I guess.  It's playing a supporting role.  Hey, Steve, when are we doing So Your Vagina's Got Talent?  Not.  It's a week from this Thursday.  Ten days away.  Ten days out.  Ideas from the staff have to be in by this Wednesday so we can get them cleared with legal and with the girl.  Legal.  Here's where...  Oh, fuck.  Why are we clearing it with legal? 
[03:01:30]  Everything has to get cleared with legal now because of the we thing.  That was the phone call I got the other day.  How about we take a we controller and show up a lawyer's ass.  What?  They have to, like, bowl.  She's got a bowl with her pussy using a we controller.  I want to get two of them in and have them play each other in tennis.  That would be called pussy tennis with the we controller.  All right.  Where are we with the squirrels?  Well, we want to eat squirrels there, Patrice.  Well, we don't. 
[03:02:00]  It's delicious and a lot of people eat squirrels.  I know.  A lot of people do eat squirrels.  All right, shut up.  How do you know that?  This came from the band.  Because I used to do web junk and they had a picture of a woman who, some shitty country  place, you know, redneck place where they cook squirrels like it ain't no problem.  Here was the problem.  In Jersey.  Tastes like chicken.  Somewhere in Jersey, people were warned to not eat squirrels because there was a toxic  waste dump.  Well, you can't eat Jersey squirrels.  People in Jersey eat the squirrels.  And there was a toxic waste dump and people in that area were warned not to eat squirrels, 
[03:02:30]  which then made everybody say, people in Jersey are eating squirrels.  Squirrel man.  So we decided to let's take advantage of that.  We'll do what we did with the rats years ago on NEW.  W, have two cooks, chefs come in, prepare the squirrels, have people eat them and see  if they puke or if they like it.  That's fine.  Eat the squirrel.  But I don't think that's an East Coast thing. 
[03:03:00]  Here's the problem.  It'll be fucked up.  We got problems though.  Legal.  Again, there is no way to prove or disprove if a squirrel has rabies.  Right.  And a rat doesn't?  At the time.  We had feeder rats that were actually used for food, and that's how we got away with  it last time.  Nobody sells feeder squirrels.  They don't sell feeder squirrels.  They must be trapped or shot.  Right.  And no one sells restaurant-ready squirrels we're finding either.  I can get rattlesnake, elk, caribou, buffalo, ostrich, alligator, turtle, anything but squirrel 
[03:03:30]  is not on the list at any of the restaurant supply places.  I had ostrich recently.  Did you?  Did you like it?  Tastes like chicken.  Oh, my.  No.  I hear it's beefier.  Like the best steak you've ever had.  No.  Yes.  Really?  Not gamey.  Try it sometime.  It's got to be gamey.  Unbelievable.  How do you motherfucker?  What happened?  Just enjoy an ostrich.  Big fucking regal animal.  May Brown.  What other exotic animals can you murder? 
[03:04:00]  May Brown's Jericho Turnpike in Huntington area where my sis works every once in a while.  You ever eat tiger taint?  It's delicious.  Tiger taint.  They got to fucking take it out with a core sampler.  Then they just leave the rest of the tiger to limp around in pain until it dies.  Oh, God.  Or it grows back its taint so you can take some more.  Yeah, you can farm the taint, but the poachers just take it and leave the tiger to die.  A little known fact about tigers, their taint grows back, so they just continually follow  tigers around and take their taint. 
[03:04:30]  A delicacy.  Baby seal eyes.  Baby seal eyes.  It's a delicacy.  Tiger taint.  Ask Hopi, it tastes like steak.  It tastes just like steak.  Tiger taint.  Tiger taint.  If it tastes like steak, why kill the fucking ostrich?  Get a steak.  It tastes better than steak.  Does it?  But you can't find a lot of ostriches around.  Does this tiger taint have any zero trans fats?  No, no trans fats.  It's very lean.  I don't think that this taint is clean. 
[03:05:00]  Could you check to see?  They clean it after it's taken out.  Oh, they go, wait, they go.  Motherfucker goes, hold up, man.  Hold up.  This is a lion taint, motherfucker.  I know the difference between a tiger taint and a lion taint.  Everyone knows lion taint's a lot tougher.  A lot more gristle.  Bill has eaten seal eyes.  Baby seal eyes.  No, I haven't eaten it, but it is a delicacy.  The Eskimos mash them up, and I think they add sugar.  It's like ice cream.  Everything's a delicacy to an Eskimo.  Bill, shut up.  I love Bill, but sometimes he's just crazy. 
[03:05:30]  Wait a minute.  Eskimos take seal eyes.  And then they mash them up into like a paste.  Yes.  And then add sugar and eat it like ice cream.  Yes.  Why wouldn't they just put sugar on the snow?  And eat that.  Or render some whale blubber and then freeze that and add sugar.  What is it about baby seal eyes or seal eyes that is a delicacy? 
[03:06:00]  High protein.  And they need the protein, I guess, up there in the cold?  The point is, it's a delicacy to the Eskimos.  Yeah.  And that's because there's no McDonald's around.  They also think whale penises are a delicacy.  Yep.  They eat the whale cock, I think.  I think they eat the whale cock.  Bone and all.  Love that whale cock.  What?  Just mark it and use it in a promo later.  What can I say?  All right.  Let's say hi to Ryan in Connecticut.  Ryan, what's up?  Ryan.  What's happening, man?  Hey.  Hey, I just want to let you guys know that it's not that big a deal to eat a wild squirrel. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  I'm by myself.  As you actually have.  And what does it taste like?  You know what I mean?  Well, the only thing is there's not that much meat on them.  I mean, once you get them like kind of cleaning them up, there's not a hell of a lot of stuff there.  Yeah, but why would you eat a squirrel?  It sounds gross.  Yeah, at first it was, but I think it was a long weekend.  We were out at a big race weekend.  Wait, wait, wait.  I don't care what you do.  Chester's Liver writes on the feedback, the best meat ever is hippo knees. 
[03:07:00]  They're phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Hippo knees.  And somebody else said they tried pigeon pussy, so.  You need so many of them, though, to even get a – it's like caviar.  Yeah, right.  The price.  Holy shit.  And it only tastes good with a delicious bit of couscous.  Couscous and pigeon pussy.  Pigeon pussy.  It's fantastic.  Here's the bit.  We're only going to do it for five minutes.  Okay.  We challenge you to come up with something more tastier than tiger taint. 
[03:07:30]  A more obscure and must-be delicious delicacy that people from all over the globe – well,  from certain parts of the globe would find delicious.  Not just Eskimos.  Yeah.  Because, you know.  Could be anywhere.  Like, obviously, India would be where the tiger taint would be a delicacy.  Of course.  And Bengal.  But, you know.  Bengal.  Because of flight, though, we could get it over here and it'll still be fresh.  Well, some of it's got to be fresh. 
[03:08:00]  Panda toes.  Little panda toes.  And is that like a meal or do you just snack on them while you watch television?  It's kind of like a frog leg.  It's a gristle, almost like oxtails.  Yeah.  Which is actually an actual delicacy.  I picture panda toes on a bar somewhere.  It's just little munchies while you're having a beer.  No way.  That's fucking delicacy, man. 
[03:08:30]  That is delicacy shit.  Yeah, panda toes.  Panda toes.  Not easy to get.  Special sauce.  Deep fried truffles.  That's a $50 appetizer.  What kind of sauce?  Maybe a little buffalo wing sauce on the side.  A little hot sauce.  A little something light to not take away from the flavor.  Do you need a hot sauce or no?  Yeah, you need a little sauce to make it.  Or maybe a little ranch.  Ranch dressing.  Fuck it.  A little ranch.  How about owl scalp?  Like you fry them like potato chips.  Fly fried.  Owl scalp.  Owl scalp. 
[03:09:00]  And then you fry them up like potato chips.  And they're crunchy.  Crunchy fried owl scalps.  I told you.  That sounds good.  That almost sounds good.  All right, Patrice.  That's a delicacy in the Northwest.  Patrice can make things sound really delicious.  It can sound good.  As you think of another one there, Patrice.  Luke in Texas.  Luke, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  I was going to ask Bill.  Where the fuck does an Eskimo get sugar from?  All right, Bill.  Where do the Eskimos get sugar? 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, Bill.  I don't fucking know.  Cuba?  Oh, okay.  Where we all get sugar, right?  That's true, Bill.  From the Alaskan sugar fields.  And then I was going to also offer midget fingers.  The delicious midget fingers.  Can't eat human.  That's cannibalism.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on.  Let's keep it to animals there, sir.  Although midgets are barely human.  I'm getting one here.  Armadillo armpits.  Very, very rare. 
[03:10:00]  Very hard to get.  Everything else is hard like armor on them.  But if you ever turn an armadillo over, they're soft.  You would think the belly is the tastiest part.  But the armpits of an armadillo.  What do you have to do is...  And how would it be prepared?  I think like a scallop.  You got to get it off the armadillo itself.  I envision an ice cream scooper.  Yeah, like a very sharp scooper.  So it comes out and then you use it like a scallop.  You would like a sea scallop.  And you plop it down on your plate like sorbet. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, whap.  Good stuff.  Armadillo armpit.  Flamingo calves.  Again, very rare because there's really nothing there.  There's nothing there.  Just a thin strip of meat.  Pulled off like string cheese.  Most people don't know of these delicacies.  But they're wonderful. 
[03:11:00]  We got T-bone.  T-bone.  What about the ever-popular penguin penis poppers?  You can only get them in the wintertime.  You can only get them in the penguin, of course.  Yes, of course.  But these are delicacies, man.  Penguin poppers.  Penis.  You know, I mean, you got to murder a penguin just for the penis.  It's just wrong.  Yeah, see, this is the deal, too.  When you get these delicacies from the animal, the rest of the animal is completely wasted.  Useless.  It just lays there and rots away.  It's just wrong.  Because you got to get it fresh.  Hey, we got one from Shady Rudy from RonFez.net. 
[03:11:30]  Piranha Prostate from Brazil.  Just the littlest tiny prostate.  That would have to, again, be like some type of delicacy, like caviar, where it's just harvested.  All right, here's another one coming over now.  How about koala Achilles? 
[03:12:00]  You just snip them out.  He just snipped the Achilles.  And you leave them there dragging themselves back into the outback.  Fried koala Achilles.  And they're like french fries, I bet.  Oh, my God.  Because they'd be little strips.  And then the little koala would be dragging himself with just his front paws through the outback.  Back into the bush because his legs don't work.  And you eat one of the delicacies in like a, like after you finish the hippo knees. 
[03:12:30]  You keep it and make it into like a bowl.  So it's another delicacy like penguin penis popping in the hippo knees.  We got one coming in from Snapman from Wackbag.com.  I'm simply Wolverine's scrotum.  Dad, who's going to eat that?  Cowbell, Bill.  But it's got to be a delicacy somewhere.  Hey, Bill.  Hey.  What's up, man?  What's going on, man? 
[03:13:00]  You got a delicacy?  Is this trying to make me laugh?  Wait a minute.  Wow.  Antelope cheeks.  Just the cheeks.  The rest of it, it stinks.  It's just a bunch of antelopes running around with a hole in their most tender part of it.  Get them cheeks.  Them tender cheeks.  And you cook it just till it's not, it's not pink anymore.  Like a little cutlet. 
[03:13:30]  Very rare.  It's served up very rare.  What's even funny is a small animal's cheeks just like some fucking...  Patrice, you're killing me.  Oh, God.  I'm sorry, dude.  It's just making me laugh.  Just fucking obscure body parts of an animal.  Oh, fuck.  This is the pot show today.  What do you got, Bill?  My partner took me out to a Thai restaurant a couple of weeks ago.  And kidding around, he says, you know, what are we going to have for dessert? 
[03:14:00]  Monkey balls?  Who?  Monkey balls.  Monkey balls.  Monkey balls?  Right.  So I'm laughing.  You know, and we get the dessert menu, and on there it says long ham.  Long ham?  What the fuck are long ham?  He looks at me and goes, they're monkey balls.  Get the fuck out of here.  I'm not sure if he was yanking my clank, but there are only a couple things on the menu.  One of them was long ham.  He said they were monkey balls.  And another one was sticky banana. 
[03:14:30]  Sticky banana.  I said, you got to fucking be kidding me.  I'm going to get monkey balls and sticky bananas.  I don't want to know what the fuck that is.  All right.  I don't know if you remember.  We were at that Japanese place.  Yeah.  Right?  They had a California roll, different kinds of rolls.  Do you remember one that was called out of cunt roll?  Oh, yeah.  Out of cunt roll.  Yeah, it was on the menu.  I'm sure it wasn't a real cunt, but I think it was a lot lost in the translation. 
[03:15:00]  Here we go.  Let's see.  Somebody people did it.  That's so stupid.  underside of the pelican's bill.  Oh, my God.  You can't eat it, but it's a perfect serving dish for monkey palms.  You got to slice the monkey palm off and serve it in a deep fried pelican bill.  That must be, that must be, that must be white meat.  That's gotta be white meat.  Yeah. 
[03:15:30]  How about, how about hamster lips?  They're so tiny.  Just sauteed hamster lips.  You got to collect a lot of them.  Here's one coming in from someone's cell phone.  Oh, Tade.  Simply stuffed whale blowhole.  Wait a minute, that fucked up.  Because that's a fucked up thing.  You got to kill the animal and just take that specific.  Just take the one thing.  And throw the rest out.  You're out hunting. 
[03:16:00]  You catch this giant majestic beast and you cut his blowhole out.  Blowhole out with a special blowhole carving tool.  And there's probably a place where the blowhole ends, so it's an entire, his entire blowhole system is fucked up.  Well, here's another one.  Oh my god.  Elephant eyelids.  No, motherfucker can't bleak.  We got to hunt him down.  Yeah, the best part of this bit is the animal continues to live somehow. 
[03:16:30]  Without his eyelids, he cannot bleak.  Because they are a delicacy for the Eskimos.  Oh my god.  Cheetah heels.  Cheetah heels.  Heels.  Is that the fuck that?  You take, you take what's important to the animal?  Peanut butter and jellyfish sex.  Bill from Pittsburgh.  Oh my god. 
[03:17:00]  Cheetah heels.  You catch it and take his fucking heels.  Oh my god.  That's not right.  God damn.  That is just horrible.  Cheetah heel.  I wish it was endless parts of the body.  All right, Bill.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Cowbell Bill.  Oh.  Kangaroo hips.  Kangaroo hips.  It's like eating ribs.  Just delicious kangaroo hips. 
[03:17:30]  Oh.  Oh, shit.  There's a couple of manatee tail jerky.  You got to make jerky out of it.  Out of something.  Yeah.  Oh.  Elephant bottom lips, too.  Bottom lips.  Just this bottom lip.  Oh, god damn.  Oh, what was the one you just read, Obie?  What's the, what did he say?  Elephant eyelids.  Oh, the eyelids.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  No.  Cheetah, cheetah heels.  Cheetah heels. 
[03:18:00]  Cheetah heels.  Gorilla biceps.  Oh, you fucking.  That's kick to the uterus from Michigan.  Oh, god damn.  Gorilla biceps.  Kangaroo pouches.  Oh, pecs.  You can even eat the pecs.  Gorilla pecs.  Monkey pecs.  Kangaroo, I got it.  Kangaroo pouch salad. 
[03:18:30]  I was.  They make the salad in there, and then you get to eat the kangaroo pouch when you're done.  Pouch from around it, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Holy shit.  Shit, shit, shit.  God damn.  Oh, my god.  That's some funny shit.  Cheetah heels.  He needs his heels, but the fact that he runs so much, they're really delicious.  Breast of beagle.  They're so tender.  Beagle breast?  Breast of beagle. 
[03:19:00]  Hey, did we?  We blew up the phones anyway.  Fuck me.  Oh, man.  They got to.  We got to get another phone system.  Left.  It's happened too much.  Left more penguin flippers, Stu.  Just the left.  Just the left.  That's what makes it so fucked up.  It's like whale blowhole stew or whatever.  Right.  To cut out his blowhole.  Just so we eat it. 
[03:19:30]  That's how fucked up we are.  Right now, we only have instant feedback.  We blew up the phones.  More people are listening to the show.  We're blowing up the phones.  More and more lately.  To cut out the blow.  You cut out the fucking blowhole just for your sandwich.  Oh, we're hilarious, man, with that shit.  I think we blew out the instant feedback, too.  That's not a dating either.  Pate of hummingbird esophagus.  Hummingbird pate. 
[03:20:00]  Like their little esophagus.  You pull it out.  It can't be any more than, like, fucking angel hair pasta.  Yet you're going to make a fucking pate out of it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Pate out of it.  Hummingbird pate.  You have to go out and catch that little motherfucker while he's slapping his wings.  And pull his little esophagus out.  And catch him and make him pate.  Ow.  Oh. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, hummingbird pate.  Wow.  Oh.  How about eagle throat?  How about eagle throat?  Actually, eagle wingtips.  Right at the part where they start bleeding.  Oh, just so they can't fly no more.  Wow, we blew up the instant feedback. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, everything just.  People really.  But now the.  Oh, cheetah heels just hit me, man.  Cheetah heels.  Sauteed little kitten noses.  Oh, kitten noses.  That little leathery nose.  That's why you have to saute it so the tenders them up.  It's almost like.  It's almost like chicken.  It's like the inside of the turkey.  Yeah, yeah.  Kitten noses.  Kitten noses.  It can be a little dry with some butter, some thyme.  Oh, it's got to be good, though. 
[03:21:30]  It's got to be tender.  Oh, no salt.  Dry right out.  Kitten noses.  How about anaconda sphincters?  Oh, my favorite.  I think I have some cheetah heels.  Cheetah heels.  Cheetah heels.  That got me, man.  Cheetah heels.  That got me, man.  The award today.  Oh, my God.  Jamie, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How about some condor tongue?  Condor tongue?  Tongue.  Or cunt.  Whatever. 
[03:22:00]  He's heating up right now.  Fred in Brooklyn.  Fred, what's up?  Yo, platypus, Bill.  Just like when fucking Bugs Bunny blows the bill off a dappy duck.  Fucking platypus.  Yeah, that's a rare animal.  Platypus chips.  Hard to get.  Platypus.  Let's go to bed.  Humminbird pate is very close to him.  Humminbird pate.  Holy shit.  Like, they're so little.  You need something little.  Just a tender pate. 
[03:22:30]  Like that.  Humminbird pate.  You know how expensive something like, like, parakeet retina.  Just the money.  Like, parakeet retina.  What do you make out of it?  A goulash.  Oh, some recipe with parakeet retina.  Something that just takes tens of thousands of parakeet retinas.  How about, how about leopard spot stew?  Leopard spot.  Just the spots.  Again, using a fucking little coring thing, like an apple corer. 
[03:23:00]  Oh.  And you just take the parts where the spots are.  Oh, my God.  And leave this holy fucking pained leopard with no spots left.  And the way you cook it is like this iron pan specially made for leopard spots.  Oh, just made for leopard spots.  Does it look like the eggshell thing?  It just fits right.  Oh, glazed leopard spots.  Let's go to Ben in New York.  Ben, what's up?  Oh, fuck me.  Polar bear pituitary.  You gotta just get to the base of the brain and carve that out and leave his bloody white carcass on a fucking ice shelf. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, God damn it.  How about, how about those little stems that hold the eyes on a hermit crab?  You know, just those little stems.  And you gotta clip them off.  Clip the eye off and then clip the stem.  And the thing has gotta be, what, a sixteenth of an inch long. 
[03:24:00]  And you collect up thousands of them.  And you dip them in a little honey.  And then, no, you make something like a wheatina out of it.  Hermit crab eye stem wheatina.  Just the little things that hold the eyeball on.  The shit they use to look up.  Yeah, that it kind of moves around and shit.  Oh, my God.  How about bat knuckles? 
[03:24:30]  How about great white shark, lower jaw bones?  Oh.  Delicacy.  But it's only the lower jaw bones.  Oh, shit.  Oh, that shit.  That couldn't even get enough of that.  I can't.  It's pituitary.  After somebody says something, you think of the next part of the body.  Now you think of spine.  Oh, yeah.  And you think of, you know, the back of it.  Oh.  Hello.  What's up, guys?  Hey, what do you got? 
[03:25:00]  Snake hip broth.  Where is there?  There's no hip.  There's no hip.  How about hedgehog knuckle poppers?  There's no hip.  Hedgehog.  Dude, this bit, it is so stupid, but it blew up everything.  It's consistent stuff.  Look, the answer feedback doesn't work.  The phones are barely working.  Either that or everyone said, this is so stupid, I got to go listen to something else.  Oh, my God. 
[03:25:30]  This has truly been the pot show.  Oh, shit.  The fucking...  I know there's just a couple more here.  Vulture hamstrings.  Cheetah heels.  Cheetah heels.  It just has such an evil thing because they need their heels.  Like, to take them away from...  They took away their fastest animal on Earth's heels.  And just take his heels.  Cheetah heels. 
[03:26:00]  It's so wrong.  And whale blowhole doesn't slide as good as cheetah heels in your mouth.  But the idea of taking the motherfucker's blowhole.  That's like a big roast, too.  You know, that would be a big fucking meal.  Blowhole roast.  Yeah.  Blowhole roast.  How would you cook them?  Hmm.  A little garlic sauce.  Because you got to take the meat around the blowhole because the blowhole is just a hole.  So you need another coring tool that can really rip out what amounts to about a good six inches of meat from around the hole. 
[03:26:30]  And go down about, what, a foot and a half?  And then you pop the blowhole out.  That's what eggs and breadcrumbs make blowhole loaf.  And then you can stuff it with other cool shit.  Yeah.  You just, like, stuff it with fucking, like, rhino face.  Rhino face!  You just cut that mouth off of the rhino that kind of looks like a beak.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my gosh. 
[03:27:00]  The meat that holds crab's eyes up.  Fuck the crab meat.  So little.  Just if I would.  Listen, I'm not abusive to animals, but I love to eat the meat that holds crab's eyes up.  If I could take that and not take his eyes, I would.  What do you want me to fucking do?  How about giraffe neck gyro?  Oh, because you can carve it down like a gyro. 
[03:27:30]  Because to take what an animal needs is so, that's why cheetah heels are so fucked up, to take his heels.  Oh, giraffe shins.  Hitman.  Hitman, I think, has a delicacy here.  Chimpanzee voice box burgers.  You removed their ability to make sound.  Chop it up into a chop meat and make burgers out of them.  They're tender.  They taste like beef. 
[03:28:00]  Dolphin.  Dolphin larynx.  Fucking porpoise throat.  I'm going to eat a male dolphin's Adam's apple.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, is that horrible?  Oh, man.  Killer whale stomach.  Just the white part.  You're going to have the black part.  I want that tender white stomach.  The belly. 
[03:28:30]  The belly.  Oh, killer whale belly.  Owl pupils.  Just to eat what an animal needs is a vibe.  That's so fucked up.  Because it's a delicacy, right?  They need their eyes.  Owl eyes.  Oh, I know.  Oh, my God.  Fucking cheetah heels, man.  It's just so wrong.  Deep fried lynx eardrums.  Again, like a chip.  Oh, just fried lynx eardrums. 
[03:29:00]  It's just so fucked up.  Oh, God damn it.  Coyote nose tips.  Elephant inner thigh moose.  You really got to whip that for a while to get it to really stand up.  Elephant saggy ass chili.  Oh, God.  That's good.  Oh, fuck me, man. 
[03:29:30]  All right.  105.  What is that?  What happened?  I was just looking at 105.  What is that at?  What?  105.9.  Oh, that's WCKG Chicago.  Oh, okay.  Buffalo chin.  Just that hairy chin.  They can actually mold it into a handle.  And he dies because he can't hold his face up no more.  You took the only thing that the buffalo uses to hold his face up.  You motherfuckers, you. 
[03:30:00]  Oh, you bastards.  Oh, you bastards.  Took his face.  Camel hump guacamole.  I think people do eat camel hump, don't they?  Make it into a guacamole.  Oh, shit.  They're all delicacies.  Delicates, delicious.  Anteater snout meringue.  Oh, I can't get enough.  Oh, shit.  It's so wrong.  People find, well, thank you, Bill. 
[03:30:30]  It's so wrong.  For your seal eye fucking ice cream.  Oh, so wrong.  Delicacy.  Yeah.  Baby seal eyes.  That's great.  Yeah, a lot of people going for the eyelids and the whooping crane hip joint cartilage.  Would you mix that up?  Poached parrot feet.  Poached.  Now you got to get in the hot.  Yeah, now you got to try to see how you're cooking them.  Because parrot feet alone might not be good.  Because that sounds like a delicacy. 
[03:31:00]  Anything fried doesn't.  Yeah, fried is just, you know.  That makes everything.  But hummingbird pate, you figure, you go, at some point somebody ate a hummingbird.  Yeah.  They caught it and fried it just to see what a hummingbird tastes like.  Lemur paw flan.  Lemur.  Flan.  The lemur paw.  Very tender, those little animals.  Oh, my head hurts, man.  Yeah.  Take a break.  That was very funny.  Let the phones recover. 
[03:31:30]  I don't know, man.  They're dead.  Oh, man.  Instant feedback just destroyed everything.  Everyone had an idea.  Nothing could update fast enough for our system.  Oh, shit.  That's good news.  I mean, do they have to reboot it?  I don't know what they got to do.  We'll step aside and figure it all out.  On this day prescribed by law and marked by ceremony, we are led to one conclusion.  This place just blows.  You're being harsh.  The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[03:32:00]  Well, Patrice has decided that the whale blowhole is the worst.  Oh, my God.  It's the worst morally.  It's so wrong, man.  Close to cheetah heels because cheetah's very majestic.  Cheetah heels is a hummingbird pate.  Hummingbird pate is just pompous.  Because now we're getting not only the foods, but the scenarios. 
[03:32:30]  See, we figured the hummingbird is really cool to look at.  Right.  Just hovers there.  But then to break that little guy open, use his guts as pate, and then sit there with  that pompous little butter knife.  And it's a small, ugly one that's bent funny, Steve.  Yeah.  And it has that scoop that fucking hummingbird pate out.  And then a little piece of Melba toast.  And you took a bite, and you got a little in your cheek, and you're spreading the rest 
[03:33:00]  on it, and you're telling your guests, like, fabulous, fabulous hummingbird.  Who has, what part of the nation has best hummingbirds?  Oh, it's good northeast because I've had some down south, and it's not as good as it.  Try some.  Try some.  I defy you not to have some more.  So, Cliff, you were saying that northeast hummingbird is always the best.  Always the best.  Really?  Fabulous.  I heard that midwest hummingbird was delicious, Cliff.  I've never tried it, but I'm just reading in Bon Appetit magazine that the hummingbird 
[03:33:30]  pate from the northeast is, let me, here, have a little more.  I'll just use my pompous little butter knife and put it on my Melba toast.  On Melba toast?  Get into the blowhole.  The worst whale.  The worst.  It's, other than, I was saying.  Patrice has figured it would take, it's only 20 pounds at the most.  It's 20 pounds.  At the most.  If you cut the entire blowhole out, down to the core.  Now the whale has no mechanism to stop from drowning. 
[03:34:00]  Right.  The blowhole seals up when he goes down.  You don't kill him.  You just take his blowhole.  Blowhole.  And I figure a real good piece of blowhole would be 30 pounds.  Big 30 pound piece of blowhole.  Right.  So now, the fucker has to stay on top of the water.  So animals go, why is this something going on with this fucking sperm whale?  This nigga ain't came down to breathe in hours.  You know what?  I think the motherfucker ain't got no blowhole. 
[03:34:30]  No blowhole.  Because if he went down, it would be like, picture an open manhole cover and water just pouring  into it.  And like you said.  On a rainy day.  It just drowns.  The blowhole closes.  Yeah, closes his blowhole.  When he goes down underwater.  Whales hold their breath.  That's, you know what?  That's like cutting your entire nose off.  And then, like, yeah.  Yeah.  You cut.  You have to carve it all out.  Because it's not something. 
[03:35:00]  I hear what you're saying.  But then the well fills up with water.  You carve everything out and jump in a pool.  And then goes into that death spin and it's going to the bottom of the ocean.  And then we pictured him a little flapping around at first.  But then he'd die.  He'd drown pretty quick.  And then that slow sink to the bottom.  Where just, he hits nose first.  And then the silt comes up.  And he slowly goes over and just rolls there.  And he bounces a couple.  Yeah.  Because he's all full of water.  Because it came in his blowhole.  And then somewhere in France. 
[03:35:30]  Somewhere in France is some tourist just going like, oh, all right, Henri.  Henri, this is the most fabulous blowhole I've ever taken.  What type of sauce is on this?  Because I've had blowhole before.  But let me.  Another forkful.  And different whale blowhole.  What do you think is more delicious?  Do you think killer whale blowhole is a lot more delicious than sperm whale?  Well, I've had the killer whale, the sperm whale blowhole.  The very rare blue whale blowhole. 
[03:36:00]  It's got a consistency that's a lot like filet mignon.  And what tastes it?  Baby blowhole or the adult?  If you could get baby blowhole, I would pay through the nose.  I would applaud you.  I'd pay top dollar for baby blowhole.  He's just carving.  It would come in a big pompous presentation.  Maybe even with some type of little garnish that looks like a smiling whale.  Like the whale would be happy that he had his blowhole taken out like a coarse sample.  And you're just cutting away. 
[03:36:30]  Oh, my God.  Making it to a lava.  You've got to drive a cake.  What did you order?  You got the cheetah heel?  You know what?  You got the ultra.  Let me try some of your cheetah heel.  You've got to try this blowhole.  But you wouldn't.  It's a 30-pound piece of meat.  Let's imagine how big a whale is to cut his blowhole off.  It would have to be, you know, it's a delicacy.  It's almost like killing an entire animal.  Yeah.  So you got to cut it up into steak or cut it up into.  Because people are thinking the hole. 
[03:37:00]  It's a special at the restaurant.  But you're taking the entire mechanism.  You're taking a lot of meat from around it.  And then the flaps that he uses to close off the water has got to be like.  The blowhole closing muscle.  That's the blowhole cutlet.  Because it's a little thin.  So you use it like a cutlet.  You can bread it.  Fuck me.  This is so wrong.  It's delicious.  And would you say, OB, like, and this sounds all fucked up.  But that's what we do.  Oh, this happens.  We just do it to cows.  You take that machine with a bolt and just right in the head. 
[03:37:30]  And then hack them up with the same shit you use to fucking make a chair in Woodshop.  The bandsaw.  There's a leg.  Like, another leg.  Yeah, we're laughing.  Of course this goes on.  Yeah, we do that.  With the baby seals and the furs and all that shit.  We just took it to the next level because we're smoking pot today.  I got to throw something in, though.  What happened?  Are people still clubbing baby seals?  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  That's still happening.  Fuck yeah.  I mean, I understand Eskimos do it.  They're kind of allowed.  Like, Eskimos and Indians have this thing. 
[03:38:00]  They're allowed to do whatever the fuck they want.  Because we feel guilty.  Yeah.  But we can't do that.  I don't think there's, like, are there Nordic people walking around clubbing seals?  Fuck yeah, man.  Is there a more economical way?  It's getting harder.  I guarantee you can find a place they're still doing it.  I Googled it.  There's a reason why you don't shoot them.  Somewhere deep in Russia, they're still doing that.  But it's something.  I think it's just economics.  No, no.  Something goes on the way.  There's a real...  I forgot.  I just Googled it.  I forgot.  It's why they don't...  You don't get that enjoyable scream from the mother?  Oh, it's horrible, dude.  That haunted me for a long time. 
[03:38:30]  It's the most awful things.  Videos are awful.  But I think there's a reason they don't shoot them.  What kind of guy can do that and then go home and go,  Home for work, honey?  Yeah.  Where are the kids?  Come here, dear.  Let me wash the blood off my hands first before I say hi to the kids.  A little baby seal blood all over me.  So, what's for dinner?  Here, and just to take a big black eyes look up at you with a pure white fart  and all you think of is,  Let me take this club and I'm going to smash this motherfucker's skull right the fuck in.  Hey, can we change gears? 
[03:39:00]  We got Tyra Banks.  And we got video games.  Tyra Bank, butt roast.  We get a lot more these days.  No kidding.  Yeah, she's wearing that same bathing suit that she looked fat in on Thursday's show.  She went to a personal fucking trainer.  And got a smaller version of the suit.  Don't make me think.  That's the same exact suit.  Don't make anyone try to think it's the same suit.  It's a smaller version.  It was taken.  The picture was taken at a weird angle.  Someone got a picture of her with a big fat ass.  In an awful bathing suit. 
[03:39:30]  In a horrible grandma bathing suit.  So, she got her body back in shape.  Got a smaller bathing suit.  She's going to do a whole thing out there at the show.  But we got Tyra confronting a World of Warcraft addict.  Alright, World of Warcraft.  One of these multi...  She's never even heard of it in her life.  Massive multiplayer.  Yeah, online role-playing game.  She's never heard of it.  She's fucking a model.  What does she know?  But an addict.  And she's confronting this person?  Yeah, yeah.  Alright.  So, I know Ben Stein's son was an addict. 
[03:40:00]  And Ben Stein actually sent his son to a rehab center.  For what?  For EverQuest.  EverQuest, okay.  Because he was going downstairs in the middle of the night and he'd see his son playing EverQuest.  And he would tell him, you can't play that game anymore.  And the kid lost his fucking mind.  Creeped out on him.  So, he put him in rehab.  So, now Tyra is going to be taking on somebody.  This is Autumn.  And she is seriously ready to walk out on her fiancé, Sean.  Because she has had it.  He has been seduced by a new love. 
[03:40:30]  But it's not...  But she hasn't had it.  Or she would have walked out.  Seduced by a new love.  A lot of chicks get really fucking pissed at this shit.  All really pissed.  A lot of relationships have ended over these types of games.  They're crack games.  They're the games that...  They have no end.  So what?  What is her other option for him?  Fucking bitch.  What is the other car's playing?  Oh, really?  I'm going to stop?  Okay, I'll stop, sweetie.  What's the option? 
[03:41:00]  What are we doing?  Just stop.  Okay, fuck off.  Fuck off.  I'll give you ten reasons why I'm going to clown.  He has been seduced by a new love.  But it's not another woman.  The happy home of Autumn, Sean, and their baby daughter was recently interrupted by an intruder.  What was it?  I'm so tired and fed up with the same World of Warcraft.  Sean is addicted to World of Warcraft, a very popular video game, spends every wake-up moment in front of the screen, leaving Autumn feeling like a single parent. 
[03:41:30]  Sean's addiction has gotten so bad, he will even ignore his prime movie girl right behind him.  Oh.  Tyra, will you please teach me how to show Sean some tough love?  Oh, boy, here it comes.  Oh, tough love.  I want to know the answer.  First of all, get rid of the computer.  You must get rid of the computer.  If you need it for email, that's one thing. 
[03:42:00]  But make sure all the games are removed from the computer and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I'd ignore that fucking screaming piece of shit behind me, too.  I'm sure the kid was fine.  Sounded like a whistle.  Let's see what happens here.  Give me some examples of when he's choosing the game over you.  I have two examples that really stick out.  On his birthday in June, we were supposed to go to a birthday dinner.  And he kept telling me, five more minutes, five more minutes.  And it turned into hours, and we ended up missing his birthday dinner. 
[03:42:30]  And so...  You know what, though?  He had a great birthday.  Yeah, that was his birthday.  What about you, Missy?  Listen to this.  It's his fucking birthday.  So what's the problem?  Let him do what he wants.  He had a great birthday.  Enough.  Sounds like he did exactly what he wanted on his birthday.  Holy shit.  That's hilarious.  Women always...  Five more minutes, five more minutes, and it turned into hours, and we ended up missing  his birthday dinner.  All right.  And also, when I was in labor with our daughter, it took a while.  So he went home to take a shower, and he ended up getting on the computer and playing 
[03:43:00]  for about three hours.  And then came back to the hospital before I gave birth.  All right.  Before you gave birth.  Before I gave birth.  You're supposed to sit down and listen to you fucking yell.  I don't have a uterus.  Breathe.  This is between you and God.  I'm going to be gone.  Just do this.  I did my job.  I pumped you full of hot lead, bitch.  Yeah.  Here's a bucket of ice chips.  I'll be back in three hours.  I have an epic weapon to get.  Chew on these for a while.  Computer and playing for about three hours, and then came back to the hospital. 
[03:43:30]  Three hours goes by in two seconds.  He left you to go play the game while you were in labor?  Yeah.  That.  Dr. Gary.  You know, I think that's pretty intense.  Oh, by the way, Dr. Gary.  Dr. Gary, please.  The dude from the Danny Bonaduce show.  Help us, Dr. Gary.  This is his new gig, helping out Tyra.  What are they going to do for this guy?  I don't know.  They got a solution?  Well, we got to leave.  I need a solution.  Oh, all right.  Was there anything major that happened that would have sent him to the couch other than 
[03:44:00]  this computer thing?  Yeah.  A huge fight that you guys had?  Yeah, just to set it up, obviously, he's now sleeping on the couch.  On the couch?  Yeah.  About something else, any of that?  Not a huge fight.  I do.  I think this is kind of bad, but I gained a little bit of weight after I had our daughter,  and that's what I'm doing.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  Goddamn rich cunt.  That's what it is.  I mean, I'm not.  You got fat.  I got to go online.  I'm not sexy anymore, but I want you to continuously treat me the way you was before I tricked 
[03:44:30]  you into marrying me.  When I used to look good, and now I look like a fucking piece of garbage.  I look like a blowhole, and you're supposed to treat me the same way when I was faking  it until I got you to marry me, and now I tricked you, you fucking dick.  You think I'm going to fall for the banana in the tailpipe?  And he did.  Not a huge fight.  I do.  I think this is kind of bad, but I gained a little bit of weight after I had.  Oh, no. 
[03:45:00]  And that fucking phony tyrant didn't go, all right, sweetie, you fucked my whole show up.  You became a fat bitch.  Yeah, let's make believe it's about the video game.  Come on now.  Not a huge fight.  I do.  I think this is kind of bad, but I gained a little bit of weight.  I would have said, we'll be back after this message.  Remove her. 
[03:45:30]  Remove her.  What's your name, fat body?  I do.  I think this is kind of bad, but I gained a little bit of weight after I had our daughter,  and that's when it kind of started, and I think that has something to do with it.  Oh, shit.  That's how I feel.  I hate that, because women always say that it's the weight, and it's us, and that's not  what it's about.  You're a beautiful woman.  Shut up.  It is sometimes, you dumb fuck.  Stupid Tyra.  You know something?  Let me tell you something.  For dummies.  If you marry a woman who is fat, that's fine. 
[03:46:00]  That is fine.  That's what you're into.  She comes fat.  She comes fat.  You marry a girl that is skinny, and she gets fat, that is not, you're still beautiful.  No.  Unacceptable.  The guy will, now you are increasing the odds tenfold that that guy is going to go out  and start fucking somebody, because he's into skinny chicks, and he got you because you  were fucking too thin, and that's what we're inclined to do anyway. 
[03:46:30]  We're inclined to get new pussy.  So these people, she has to compete with other women.  She can't be up there fucking deciding that she's going to, that love keeps us together.  Men don't even, love is almost, when guys fall in love, it really is the end of our passion.  We're more passionate in like stage, where we like them.  Love is fucking no.  You know what I'm saying?  Because that's all we got left.  So you got to have a bitch that keeps that sex appeal going, man. 
[03:47:00]  You can't fucking have a woman that, because there's some fat girls out there that carry  it sexy, because they're fat.  They've been fat their whole life.  I look good.  Exactly.  But some skinny bitch who has to figure out how to be a fat bitch now?  No.  And she's mad that she got to go to Lane Bryant and all these fat stores?  It's not good.  Here it is.  If you marry a skinny broad, and not bone skinny or anything, just a normal average weight for height girl.  If you marry her, and she gets fucking fat, your man is embarrassed to take you out. 
[03:47:30]  He's embarrassed to take you out in front of his friends, because they look and go like,  all the guy's thinking is, you know, when he sees one of his friends with a hot girl or something is,  I remember when, you know, I remember those days.  And we're very superficial.  Yeah.  Guys are superficial.  These fucking girl shows and all this, this girl power shit, the women are always mad at us for being how we are. 
[03:48:00]  You know what I mean?  And just because I'm telling you I'm inclined to fuck a bunch of different women, that doesn't mean I do it.  It just means I'm inclined to do it, and not doing it is a chore.  You're mad at me because I'm telling you it's difficult not to cheat, difficult not to have three or four girls on the side.  Don't get mad at me because it's fucking, it is what it is.  Work with me.  You know, work the fuck with me.  Patrice is the shark, and someone is getting mad that the shark is biting things. 
[03:48:30]  That's what I say.  It is what, that's the animal we are.  It's like, stop doing that, but I'm a shark.  Like, here's the thing.  I always say like this, if you had a dog that you love, and he has a business, you had a dog you love?  And they go, yeah.  Did it love you?  Yeah.  Well, how the fuck do you know?  Did you bother it and make it say I love you every five fucking minutes?  It gave me kisses.  No.  It just existed and did what it did.  This motherfucker, you know why he loves you?  You continue to be around him, you funky fat girl. 
[03:49:00]  Let him play his goddamn game.  More of this on Saturday night.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Black Phillip, man.  By the way.  Patrice is doing a show Saturday night.  Great relationship advice.  Little ditty before we, Black Phillip, we're going to talk just a little bit, is why your woman  loves you, why scientifically we will never love at the same time, is because your girl  loves you because you're handsome, charming, funny, smart, right?  And she'll say that.  That's why I love you.  And then she goes, do you love me? 
[03:49:30]  You go, no.  Why?  Why should I love you?  Because I'm charming.  Holy fuck.  You're not charming.  I'm charming.  So.  Holy shit.  So if you, if, if, if that's what you needed to love me, then that's what I'm going to need  to love you.  So I have to make you charming before I can love you, bitch.  Why wouldn't that run as a promo for his show all fucking week? 
[03:50:00]  No kidding.  Holy shit.  Well, it's going to starting today.  Wow.  Let's see what happens with Tyra and the guy that's addicted to World of Warcraft.  Why do you think you play so much?  I, I started playing because I was pretty scared of my daughter.  I didn't want to get too attached for the SIDS reasons and.  SIDS reasons?  Yeah.  Like sudden death syndrome?  Yeah.  That kind of got dangled over my head quite a bit.  Have you had experiences with SIDS?  No, I just heard a lot about it before. 
[03:50:30]  Okay.  Dr. Gary, do you buy the whole SIDS scare?  No.  Me neither?  No.  I mean, that doesn't quite feel right.  I mean, I think scare is the right thing.  I really do.  Sean, I think that, you know, I know that you told our producers that you started playing  this game when Autumn was six months pregnant of the baby.  And in my mind, I think that what you were scared of is actually having to show up and become  a father and at some point become a husband.  You know what I would have said to that guy?  What do you know? 
[03:51:00]  You don't like girls.  Yeah.  You faggot.  That's pretty fucking funny.  You know what the truth is?  You can do all the psycho babble you want.  When you start playing one of those games for a period of time, sometimes a very long time,  sometimes a short time.  It has nothing to do with your relationship.  It has nothing to do.  You get completely involved and immersed in a fun game.  It's a human being enjoying himself, having fun playing a game. 
[03:51:30]  Sometimes it doesn't last long.  Sometimes it lasts for fucking years.  Keith the Cop was into that game for fucking a couple of years.  I was into EverQuest for a few years.  You just played it because it was very entertaining, very immersive, and a fun fucking game.  How much did you sell your character for?  I didn't.  I still have it.  I still have the character.  What are you up to?  You have some amazing things?  Level 65.  Is that good?  I haven't played it in so long.  I don't think it is anymore.  If I went on, logged on right now, it would take me a fucking, probably two weeks to even 
[03:52:00]  figure out how to play it again.  I couldn't go in a group because I'd be like the asshole that got everyone killed because  I don't know what the fuck you're doing.  Ah, character.  The weapon that I had when I stopped playing is probably like a piece of shit now.  And the hit points that I have in my armor and stuff like that is probably like tinfoil  now.  Yeah.  So, but I did the other day.  But you still could sell if it's still the same concept.  You could, somebody would buy your character for top dollar, right?  I've had that character for fucking seven years. 
[03:52:30]  I'm going to keep it.  Let it go, dude.  No.  As a matter of fact, I just bought the whole fucking box set so I could reload it onto  my new computer and maybe, you know, check it out again.  But, you know, I don't know.  Maybe, maybe not.  Let's see how Tyra handles this problem in the end.  Yeah.  Here's the solution.  Because it's easier said than done.  He says he wants to stop.  So, this is a shredder.  And not just a shredder that shreds paper.  However, this shredder shreds CDs, DVDs, and video games. 
[03:53:00]  And Potten is ready to start doing some shredding of your favorite game.  Before we do that, what does this mean to you?  That is what is ruining our relationship.  That's what's ruining our family.  How about you shred a fucking roast?  Thank you, you bitch.  Shred the Twinkies and every other fucking donut you're shoving down your gullet.  Put her loose skin in that same shredder right behind that fucking EverQuest.  Shred the baby.  How about you shred some lettuce?  Jesus Christ. 
[03:53:30]  Shred the fucking game and that'll save the marriage.  Selfish fucking horns, man.  Selfishness.  Dude, you know what I would do?  Her mouth is a shredder for fucking food.  How dare you trivialize what's making me happy, you fucking bitch?  You know what I would do?  If that happened to me, I would take the goon hand, bring her home.  Goon hand her.  Goon hand her right to the fridge and start throwing stuff out.  My girl's like, you gonna play that?  You coming to bed?  No.  I'm gonna do what I fucking want.  Now, you're in your 30s, bitch. 
[03:54:00]  Are you gonna pout because I'm doing what I fucking want?  You cursing me out?  She got a key to my place.  I really want credit.  Every time she opens her mouth, bitch, you got a key to my home.  Go fuck yourself.  Oh, wow.  Are you out of your mind?  You realize you're pretty much the only person that can live like that, right?  If you want to play a game, you play a fucking game.  It sounds logical, but Jesus.  It's so easy.  Dude, look, it's so easy to do.  It's all you got to do. 
[03:54:30]  Remember that movie War Games?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That great line that you just live by is like the computer's trying to figure out how to play fucking tic-tac-toe.  Tic-tac-toe.  And it just goes, interesting game, Mr. Rockin', or whatever.  And it's like, the only winning move is not to play.  Not to play.  Don't play.  Just be like, look.  Look.  It is what it fucking is.  This guy was an audience in Providence.  He goes, dude, one of the guys from Full Blown A's. 
[03:55:00]  And he's like, I thought you said you was engaged.  I said, no, motherfucker.  I said, my girlfriend's engaged.  I said, I'm not holding her back from how she feels about me.  Because she's always going to be elevated in her emotion.  So I said, it's fine.  You can get engaged to me.  I'm not engaged to you.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  I can't wait for Saturday.  Holy shit.  I can't wait for Saturday.  I love it.  It is as if he landed in a flying saucer, stepped out, and is spewing advice from another planet. 
[03:55:30]  Brilliant.  I love it.  But is it true?  Have you ever met a woman as talented as a human being as you are?  Let me think.  She's sitting there sucking up your charm with the idea that she's going to give you some pussy in the end.  So you're sitting there being this wonderful entity, and she's making a choice on whether you're great or not.  And then that's based on you loving her?  No.  She loves you.  She don't think there's part of her that is better than you? 
[03:56:00]  Might be, but she don't have to show it.  She doesn't have to show it to get Dick.  She has to show it.  Oh, okay.  I see where you're going.  Let's say hi to Mike in Arizona.  He's got an update on your character.  Mike?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hi.  Hey, Ant.  Your character's gimp.  They raised the level cap to 75.  Yeah.  You're going to have to grind out 10 levels.  No, I know.  I know, I know.  How long does it take to get 10 levels, you think?  10 now?  It takes a fucking long. 
[03:56:30]  It's fucking hellacious.  And not only that, you have epic 2-0s now.  I know.  I only got the first epic weapon, and that's a piece of shit now.  And all my fucking everything I got shit.  I have a 73 Ranger, and I'm ready to kill myself.  I can't stand fucking leveling anymore.  You know what?  I have one more thing to add.  The only way to, you know, yeah, it's kind of you can't beat them.  If you can't beat them, join them kind of thing.  You've got to get the fucking girl to play the fucking game.  That's the only way.  Otherwise, they'll fucking leave you.  Question out. 
[03:57:00]  Can you, can you, okay, if I start now.  Yeah.  65.  How long did it take for you to get 65?  Over a year.  No, it took years.  It took years?  I didn't play.  But isn't it still valuable?  I didn't play like a madman.  It's still valuable if I don't want to come in at one, do I?  Yeah, but no.  You could get.  I could power level you to 65 in probably a month.  Yeah.  Because I have access to the right characters. 
[03:57:30]  But, I mean, if you were to play and not know one fucking person on the server,  it would take you fucking years.  I used to play with, I used to three box.  I'd play with three fucking computers and make my own group  and play all the characters at the same time.  What's the, what's the, uh, like I was asking you today,  what's the, what happens to keep you on it?  Like the excitement of it.  What's the action part of it?  You have to level.  Leveling up.  Getting new spells.  Leveling gear.  Getting new weapons.  Getting new gear.  Yeah, that's, that keeps you on.  Progressing through the expansion, stuff like that. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  And then they put expansions out.  They keep pumping expansions out, which gives you new places to go.  Actually, the, uh, new loop.  The 13th expansion's coming out next month.  Yep, next month.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Sheesh.  All right, bye.  There goes.  That was a fucking game.  Sheesh.  When that first came out, I, there weren't even any expansions when I first saw it.  And I'll tell you, we were at NEW, I was watching TV in the office,  and they showed this game, and I'm like, what the fuck is that?  And went right to the store and bought it.  That was it.  I was on that motherfucker, like, forever. 
[03:58:30]  Just leveling.  Why'd you give up?  Yeah.  I didn't give up.  I just slowly stopped playing it, you know, over time.  Went into something else.  Got different games.  Got bored.  You get bored after a while, too, because then you realize, you know,  oh, I wanted to get to fucking, wait till I get to level 20.  The fucking shit on, that I could get, I'm going to kick ass.  And you get to level 20, and you realize, wait till I get to 30.  Now, I'm going to get the best shit.  You're never at a level where you go, I fucking rule.  It's always just some other fucking thing you got to do. 
[03:59:00]  All right.  Let's see what happens here.  Oh, this is still time.  Oh, shit.  By the way, you can play the game without the disc in it.  Yeah, that's what.  You don't need the disc to play the fucking game.  This means nothing what she's about to do.  Favorite game.  Before we do that, what does this mean to you?  That is what is ruining our relationship.  That's what's ruining our family.  What's this mean to you?  Nothing now.  No, what does it really mean?  Oh, it's rolling.  It's okay.  It was an escape for a while. 
[03:59:30]  It is an escape.  Yeah.  Still.  So this is your friend that's kind of, you know, kept you company for a long time  and distracted you and taken you away from your real life  has welcomed you into the artificial world of Warcraft.  That's not a friend to me.  Wow.  I'm very impressed.  So you're saying goodbye.  Goodbye.  Autumn.  Yeah, applaud.  His character's still up on the fucking server.  How about you give away all your shit and then delete your character? 
[04:00:00]  That's a ballsy move.  She has no clue.  This guy can just log on any time he wants.  Fuck it.  And not lose anything.  Oh, she just stinks.  Patrice, would you shred your EverQuest game?  No.  No.  No.  Come on, Tyra.  If you care about a relationship, you're just...  Shh.  I'm playing EverQuest.  Shh.  Fuck out of here with that drama.  The guy deserves it, though.  Yes, he does.  Why?  You should turn around and say, look, I'm shredding this.  Well, guess what?  I want you to lose weight. 
[04:00:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  He pussyed out on that.  He pussyed out all the way.  All you got to do is just try to logic your way through.  So, quid pro quo.  Lose weight.  And then it's always like, you know what?  Women love that idea that they want truth, but they just want a good lie.  And it's like, well, what do you feel about her gaining weight, sir?  Well, it makes me sick.  Oh, my God.  I try to bend her legs back, and this bitch is huffing and puffing.  You know what?  The audience would rip him apart.  Tyra would rip him apart. 
[04:01:00]  The wife would start crying, but that would be the honest answer.  It would be, yeah, what do you think about all the weight she's gained?  Oh, it fucking makes me sick.  Makes me sick.  I'm completely unattracted to this woman.  And then, what the fuck?  Well, I'm being honest.  She doesn't sound that attractive to begin with.  No.  So, it's like, now she looks like Bluto from Popeye, and it's like, do you want me to get  rid of the only thing that makes me happy, you fat fuck?  Do I tell you to put down that ham croissant?  He should.  Croissant.  He should get a food shredder and just fucking shred her sandwiches. 
[04:01:30]  But that's what a woman would do.  But see, a woman, you just got to let them ride out, and you always have to be threatening  them, not physically and not literally, but in your actions, threatening to get some  side pussy.  Like, da-da-da.  No, eat, sweetie.  Enjoy that bacon and bread wrap, and I love you no matter what.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-da-da-da-da-da.  All right.  Line of the day.  Patrice, what do you know about Bodogfight.com?  I don't know. 
[04:02:00]  I know that they're fighting on Bodog now.  I hate this question.  They do the MMAs.  No one ever gets it.  Mixed martial arts on Bodog.  Yeah, there you go.  Hey, Bodogfight.com.  There you go.  Because poker no longer exists on the online anymore.  It certainly does.  There's a place.  Well, I'm sure.  Yeah, illegalpoker.com.  No.  Illegalpoker.com.
