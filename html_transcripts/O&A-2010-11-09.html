<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a darkly humorous discussion about the perils of parenthood, filled with profanity and anecdotes about near-fatal accidents involving their young children.  Listener calls added further tales of childhood mishaps.  This segment transitioned into a series of unrelated topics, including a detailed and opinionated discussion of a Connecticut murder case and the death penalty, followed by a conversation about Joran van der Sloot and his victim's mother's attempt at finding closure.  They then reviewed Conan O'Brien's return to television, including a mention of Ricky Gervais, and discussed a new OnStar app.  The hosts also expressed their dissatisfaction with their minuscule appearance in a recent SiriusXM commercial, highlighting their brief screen time and the commercial's overselling of their involvement. UFC heavyweight champion Kane Velasquez was scheduled to appear as a guest the following day.

The next segment centered heavily on this SiriusXM commercial, with the hosts engaging in a comedic, albeit inaccurate, calculation of their screen time.  This led into a humorous account of a challenge given to their intern, Stevie, to buy the new Call of Duty: Black Ops game before the show ended, using only $100. The hosts provided sarcastic commentary, interjecting dramatic music and movie comparisons to Stevie's perceived incompetence.  Stevie ultimately succeeded, albeit chaotically.  Other topics discussed in this segment included a potential STD-detecting app, a bed bug parody song, a surprising middle-school football play, and an awkward Kanye West interview alongside Michael Myers, focusing on Kanye's controversial comments about Hurricane Katrina and the government's response. The hosts debated the reasons for the slow response, touching on racial issues, class divisions, and logistical challenges.  The segment included listener calls and comments.

The show continued with a chaotic discussion involving board operator Eric, whose consistent avoidance of duties resulted in a juvenile prank â€“ smearing his breakfast on the studio window.  This was followed by a detailed discussion of intern Stevie's meal plans after receiving change from a transaction, with much focus on the caloric intake.  The hosts attempted Louie Anderson impressions from "Coming to America."  A phone call with Penn Jillette, promoting his Broadway show "Play Dead," led to a wide-ranging conversation encompassing a study linking excessive texting and Facebook use to sex and drug use (with speculation about their 11-year-old nephew), the show's unique fan interactions (using the phrase "Go on O&A again"), Penn Jillette's views on the anti-vaccination movement (referencing a past Showtime special), Al Goldstein's health and homelessness, the nature of punishment and prison (with discussion on retribution vs. removing dangerous individuals), and the unsanitary conditions of zero-gravity toilets in space. Jim Norton recounted a zero-gravity striptease anecdote involving a lost coin from his deceased father's belt.  The segment was rife with profanity, vulgar humor, and offensive jokes.

The final segment began with a discussion of sex in zero gravity, recounting an attempt on a zero-gravity flight and exploring the logistical challenges.  This broadened to include other extreme sexual experiences, with Jim Norton adding humorous speculations about masturbation in zero gravity.  Penn Jillette, in studio to promote "Play Dead," shared stories about his childhood size, a physical altercation with his basketball coach, and the creative process behind his magic acts with Teller, including anecdotes about creating illusions.  He mentioned magicians Mac King and Lance Burton and discussed future appearances, including a show where magicians attempt to fool Penn and Teller.

[00:27:00]  give up my money jesus dude that's an impossible i'll throw in a billion  call it the cigarette lighter rodeo see how long it can last well legal's on the phone they say we  can't do it we can't even talk about don't even talk about it let's say hi to chris and uh md what's  up chris hello hey what's up boys hey buddy i just wanted to uh get ready for uh potty training uh 
[00:27:30]  my dog would be walking around and all of a sudden you wouldn't hear anything and we find her in the  in the closet and shitting all over the floor it was it was fucking fantastic oh my god oh my god  and uh and then when you try to take your pants off but she's all upset she starts stepping in the  shit and starts running all over the house it's oh my gosh i'm having a panic attack but isn't that  why we have pull-ups oh yeah but you take those off it's oh my god i uh yeah you bring the kid home 
[00:28:00]  and after a week you're like this is kind of easy that's what you think it really is the first like  three weeks the first three four months i would say shouldn't i be doing more honestly it was easy  until uh what day we have to like october 1st it all changed when he started crawling  how protective that trek is travis is kind of a nice guy not a violent guy but when it comes to  your kid you just would you become another person if somebody was threatening your kid absolutely we  were talking before the show started about this guy in connecticut oh it's and it's just 
[00:28:30]  worst story ever as as a father now these stories are just like 50 times worse yeah there's a there's  transcripts from the elizabeth uh smart trial that's going on that that uh my wife was reading  to me out loud last night i was i was out of my mind i'm like you've got to be fucking kidding as a  parent what they what they did to they they described how they uh grabbed her yeah it's really  this emotion that that you can't tap into unless yeah like you become it's it's weird yeah and this 
[00:29:00]  fight this fight i feel the same way but only on the other side the criminal  i just relate to that part yeah the connecticut case is infuriating because they gave him the  death penalty but they're not going to kill this guy anytime soon if ever yeah and they're going  to argue this let me let me just read once again convicted last month of strangling and raping  the wife and the and the and the two girls and then him alive and then literally burning them alive  in their beds and they're arguing the fucking death penalty is there an argument there is there 
[00:29:30]  really an argument there this guy wanted the death penalty this guy's like give it to him yeah i  agree i agree i don't give a shit give it to him because me and aunt were talking before the show  it it so becomes your life yeah this prison thing i was telling uh i don't think aunt saw it but there  was a there was a little um um video of holloway's uh mom uh talking to van der sleut in in in the  jail yesterday did she go over there oh yeah she got like i think six minutes with the guy 
[00:30:00]  and van der sleut walks in i believe he was in i want to say jeans but he was he was dressed casually  and he sat down he had a little conversation with her and stuff and she said she got some closure and  blah blah did he admit it i didn't get to see the whole thing because they're only showing like really  quick clips of it and then the time knew it was her oh really yeah she snuck in with a reporter she's  not supposed to oh i didn't know i didn't know that he is such a piece of shit but what i picked up on  was his casualness and and he he wasn't bothered at all that he's in jail and then his time was up 
[00:30:30]  with her and he got up with the guard and they kind of just casually walked out and i told that if  prison was so bothersome you want to see this guy coming in and shackles shaking because he can't  take prison anymore but that's not what what it is i think peru is probably making sure that he is  presentable to the media until his trial because he has to go on trial for that girl that he killed in  peru right but once i think he is convicted of that and he's really in peru jail i think he's in  trouble i i have hope that the jail system is a lot worse than i have that hope at least hopefully 
[00:31:00]  they'll kill him because you know to not give these guys the death penalty immediately this will  be years if they ever kill him in connecticut years had she just not pull out something and  shoot him parents are weird like that they a lot of times they want closure there's some like i've  watched him have conversations she wants the body badly that's the problem you know he could he could  give up the info what happened to her and whether she'll ever get the body back you get that close  to him pop pop yeah but she she's playing the game because she really wants for closure of the actual 
[00:31:30]  body the best way to do that is probably to turn him over this this is where you have to tip your hat  to al-qaeda they really know how to handle somebody in custody oh they certainly do this is how you  fucking well you know who you want to give them to give them to the mexican cartel let them talk to  them for five minutes they get information quickly i can't i can't argue the death penalty  with anyone i don't want to listen to the other side of this argument ever i'm hardcore too man if 
[00:32:00]  you if you purposely kill somebody that's how hardcore i am i'm like fucking kill that person  back but i mean you know this case up in kinetic is so brutal and they're gonna they're gonna argue  this for years are you kidding me what does it take yeah what does it what does it take to convict  someone of the death and give them the death penalty and actually uh do it there's no doubt  that this guy did it it's not one of these cases where it's like oh he's saying he's innocent and  this and that he did it it's horrendous kill kill the guy what no appeals no fucking bullshit none of 
[00:32:30]  this years of of wrangling and and shit just that's it done one of uh one of the philly crew uh police  officer was shot and killed a couple years ago and the trial just happened and uh and they're they  were arguing for the death penalty down there they're like no this is not really a death penalty  case even though the guy admitted in court that he killed him because he was just being stupid  as a cop if you kill a uniformed cop yeah that's supposed to give it to you automatically leaving a 
[00:33:00]  young wife and you know a child without a father and you know i i there's no doubt in my mind that's a  death penalty case that's like i said i'm fucking hardcore when it comes to this shit hard fucking  core and they're like nah this isn't a death penalty case and the guy admitted i was just being stupid  that day stupid so you can be stupid and kill a cop when i'm being stupid you know it's not killing  police officers un-fucking-believable stupid but there's i can't i i had a tough time looking at  this uh connecticut case i can't even this connecticut one is really horrible it's one of the worst 
[00:33:30]  stabbers really horrible yeah that's just because the cops were actually there at the end that they  followed the woman from the bank she signaled properly she was smart she the guy sent her into  the bank to get money and she signaled to tell her somehow look this guy whatever there's a problem  the cops picked up her trail and followed her and did not immediately surround the house yeah which  they should have but they allowed it i guess that was protocol they thought it was just a robbery 
[00:34:00]  and to turn it into a hostage situation they didn't know they didn't know these guys were  lunatic killer rapists and bank robbers but meanwhile the guy the bald guy who just got  convicted took the mother upstairs he raped her and choked her after the bank after the cops yeah  and then uh they burned they tied the girls up and they set down fire and the fucking father was able  to get out the back and stagger he lost a lot of blood and he got to a neighbor he said call the police 
[00:34:30]  to the fire department and these guys hit the cops they were leaving they ran into the police  in their car and that's how they got him yeah the cops should have surrounded the place though and  just worked out a hostage situation it was terrible shit and you know like i said they're gonna yeah  they're gonna argue this death penalty in connecticut for years to come i mean we've we have the  death penalty uh finally in new york we go down this road i know please we haven't used it we've had  it since pataki got in so how many years ago is it 10 years 12 years easy god probably longer than  that so why even have the death penalty if you're not using it yeah ridiculous we have the holloway 
[00:35:00]  vander salute confrontation if you want to hear the audio yeah i would love to confrontation or a  conversation uh more of a conversation really watch they open the door look he just look he's all  dressed nice just listen to me for just a couple minutes i have not any hate in me you're on i have  none i have none of you because i don't know you're on and i'm driven around all damn day looking for  three musketeers that i couldn't find one so i i got a milky way and i made a xerox copy and wrapped it 
[00:35:30]  so you'd know that i'm i'm here because you're on i know you want your white bag  she gave him a milky way from the nerveuse beth is niet helemaal wat we vooraf had besproken  yeah she gave him a candy bar to probably let him know that she wasn't there for bad purpose  but just it's like he should just have his throat cut bar of shit yeah  but you're looking at spending the rest of your life in prison you're on 
[00:36:00]  and i know you want to make a plea deal in caroo and in aruba in the u.s  and i've met with the prosecutors and i've met with the flores family  and you're on i won't do anything until i get some information about natalie  but it's your life it's too late for natalie it's too late for stephanie it's too late for me but it's  not too late for you you're on to to get your life back and i can you can sit here for the rest of 
[00:36:30]  your life and i can sit here for the rest of my life it's you can make some choices here you're on and  you can make the right decisions you have your whole life ahead of you because i want to know  what happened and i want to move on you're on i want to move on you know i want to you know move on  in my life and i cannot close the book and i feel as if we've lost your father we've lost another young 
[00:37:00]  girl you're on you don't need to lose your life you're in prison and be sitting here when you're 60  years of age and insisting to me that you don't know what happened if it was an accident tell me  you know i don't know i i don't know but i am i'm here  i hope you can understand also it's very hard uh hard for for for me to talk to you it's just 
[00:37:30]  really not easy i know you're doing my best i know you have a very good heart and i know that  i know that for a fact and i don't know if you would mind uh just uh giving me some i really have  been thinking a lot and just giving me some some time to think that oh yeah give me time give me your  address uh give me your address in the comment and how is she not peshying his neck with that pen  because the important she there's a bigger picture obviously you know she probably wants 
[00:38:00]  she should be allowed to just cut his finger off until he tells her like they sit like take his  scissors and cut his fucking finger she's got to be all like please just oh when how could she  not want to just shove that pen into his throat and good motherfucker well well spectro says that  she's trying to touch the heart of a heartless man no she's not she's tapping into his self-interest  she's she's trying what she's doing is i guess kind of smart because he's a sociopath i think he  really has he doesn't give a fuck he's you know extorted for money he doesn't care at all about 
[00:38:30]  these chicks or her but she's trying to tap into his self-interest by saying you can get all your  life you can have a life ahead of you you don't want to be in jail when you're 60 she's keeping it on  him and tapping into self-interest which is smarter thing he dumped her in the water too come on  probably you're not gonna find her no you just fucking go out a few miles right fish food yeah  yeah by the way that philly case the guy did get life in prison without parole so did he so how about 
[00:39:00]  death penalty they should do life without parole but no interaction with other people no tv no paper  once your appeals run out come on i don't want to be crazy but terrible you should be able to play  scrabble and parcheesi watch walking dead but only with one die we we spend most of our lives in front of  a tv anyway so whether it's in in a nice living room or a jail cell what's the difference if you  if you get to see all your programs if it's just one of those things where maybe occasionally you  get a dick in your ass i mean only for good behavior i'm talking about home not in prison 
[00:39:30]  yeah i don't know man it's just it's all fucked up it's really just all fucked up man that connecticut  cases is so bothersome yeah yeah it is so bothersome  so is that the end of the audio yeah let's listen to the rest of this  i mean i've made so many bad decisions and all for for the wrong reasons i hope you know i'm really 
[00:40:00]  very very addicted to the person especially to gambling i mean that's why i've told so many guys  and other stuff just so i have money and just like go gamble that's honestly the truth  the reasons why i did all those things you know how horrible they were but i promise you forgive me  i don't really understand what this means but you know i think that you lied and i just 
[00:40:30]  wanted to get face to face with you and you know i i feel like when i go back in time you're on  you know five years ago i'm thinking you know i felt like i felt like you didn't listen to me then  and i wanted to just let's you know tell me what happened and let me take her home 
[00:41:00]  it's always been my problem i've never listened to anyone who's meant well for me i've always done  what i myself wanted or what i myself thought was best and even after i should have learned from  my mistakes still always the same stuff to learn from my mistakes  it's a robot  i really do i really do want to write you i just need some some time to think about how  what i want to say okay and i would appreciate if you'd give me that also 
[00:41:30]  i will i will and i really give them time it's hurting  i want to know answers and i want to know what happened  you want time they'll give you time  and now she gives him uh her email address  it goes on forever but that's basically it and uh  jesus but he's got an attorney the attorney's gonna tell him to shut the fuck up it's not in his best 
[00:42:00]  interest at this point you gotta think oh believe me if this was the united states  there'd be a huge problem with this yeah like this is some kind of hidden camera thing is it  yeah oh yeah yeah they would never allow the the the guy would be he'd be back on the street if this  is the u.s but this is how it should be it should be she should have a bolt cutter right and she should  be nipping fingers this is how it should be yeah fuck protecting this uh piece of shit imagine taking  a guy and putting a hidden camera and then like bloody bloody blood you start talking to him about 
[00:42:30]  the case yeah they would do the lawyers wrong you're not the aclu that's great that peru is  fucking oh they don't give a shit i can't see peru letting this guy out early to tell her  i i can't see him get less than 25 years no no for two dead girls but oh so there you go  you want to uh take a break yeah let's uh eat somebody shit  used to stick the fit his fingers in the cigarette lighter all the time  yeah it hurts i can vouch for all right we could go back to the kid thing another day but there you 
[00:43:00]  go oh uncle paul hey um oh speaking of kids uh the jacksons talked to oprah oh yeah the jackson  children we got that audio yeah we also have uh conan's return to tv and i get to see it it was  on late i couldn't see it i watched a few minutes with the glee girl was it good much it was okay i'm not  really interested in her did he he looks very thin and good professor looks like a professor with  his beard how was it sam he did a good job it just a good job i thought he would be just i mean 
[00:43:30]  it was funny and it also seemed more like uh him than his tonight show did ah like it was a lot more  sort of uh silly and goofy and fun yeah not it didn't have that sort of tonight show mystique that  i don't think ever fit him at all yes very good that's uh that makes sense i gotta agree with you  on that one well we got his monologue and stuff so we'll we'll take a listen to how conan did  yesterday as well as he starts his uh his uh career on tv oh boy she's in big trouble lindsey

[00:49:00]  going to be in the commercial we were going to kind of be in the commercial really not our logo for  some people said it was on screen for maybe a half a second all right that's cool but  he was pushing it like we were in a super bowl commercial starring us  and what are you gonna do that's all right what are you gonna do you just make fun of it i know  i'll take care of it this week i got chelsea and i got leno i'll take care of it oh damn we got  hollywood jimmy i'll take care of the advertising hollywood jimmy is leaving us in another day and

[00:51:30]  the monologue here i'm gonna be honest though it's not easy doing a late night show on a channel  without a lot of money the viewers have trouble finding  so that's why i left mbc  the word we added those later but the weird thing is  there should just be i spent all of our money on an owl machine for this show 
[00:52:00]  back after the show we just add  the word thing is this so i put myself and my staff through this crazy huge ordeal  all because i refuse to go on at midnight okay  and so i work you know and then i get this job at 11  supposed to be a big deal then yesterday daylight savings time ended  right now it's basically midnight  we got the summer off 
[00:52:30]  good point really good point  now uh a lot's happened in the news since i went off the air and i wanted  to cover it all in one joke just in one joke yeah then i realized that's like trying to keep an 
[00:53:00]  icelandic volcano from wearing lady gaga's meat dress while a trapped chaland miner cleans up the bp  oil spill comma brett farve's penis  aside from that type of language which i don't think is appropriate no i don't either that's funny  very funny yeah and then uh ricky gervais taped a message oh good and i guess he took a little shot  at satellite radio yeah which is a little weird because uh when he needs to promote something he 
[00:53:30]  certainly is on the phone with us oh bubby you're never safe with ricky gervais i told you that 10  years ago he gets in your forget it he gets in your wheelhouse do we know who we're talking to yet  of course you do what's your name i told you already what's your name oh i don't want to get into  it here's ricky gervais on conan last night tate message hi conan um i'm really sorry things didn't  work out at your last gig um but i just wanted to wish you the very best of luck with your new show

[00:54:30]  is good morning dayton's gain i can't wait to catch you doing the weather next time i'm in  western ohio okay just one more hi conan listen don't beat yourself up about what happened in dayton  now you're back where you belong with a new show and a national audience i will definitely be tuning  in just as soon as i sign up for satellite radio that should um hold you for another seven months or so 
[00:55:00]  if he's lucky it'd be better on radio he's he's he's sort of got the looks  although his voice is a little bit annoying so it's pathetic really  fucking funny man he is funny but with the exception of the you know he's got looks for radio  thanks nana nana however he is brilliantly funny i know that is one of the like all right 
[00:55:30]  yeah you got a face for radio yeah all right it's been around for a while  well i'll tell you one thing marconi heard that you don't want to get on his bad side bubby i told  you that's such a long time ago conan ricky who knows with all these names helen bergeron signing  off oh that's right helen bergeron i forgot it was helen oh god helen yes they want kevin from  connecticut wants to name it uh bev sheckler well that's good kevin can name himself kevin can go 
[00:56:00]  name one of his shoes for all i give a hood bubby helen all right where's that app and was telling me  about his app oh a new great app from um on star on star yeah an on star app you could start your car  right now yeah stop my car phone yeah why not boom but your car is nowhere doesn't matter i could  start that bitch up right now right now and uh all full diagnostics i could check my tire pressure if 
[00:56:30]  i want i don't want to but i could i could yeah when do i need my oil changed oh i could just look  at right now and see what percentage of uh viscosity my oil is at see if i need uh an oil change  sure i get in touch with on star right there i could just touch the button i could unlock my  doors lock my doors right there from my phone it's amazing that like with the ability to that's  what satellites are the ability to do that and they still don't have an app which will help you 
[00:57:00]  connect with another person on an emotional level an emotional level oh god oh my god  how would that work would it work with colors oh you put your color out there and maybe match up  with another color you touch somebody i'm telling you here's what we'll get to you touch something  and and you're through the fingers your mood will become apparent by the way the blood is flowing or  your skin tensing up your phone will feel it send it that's why aliens don't move because all this  emotion and shit is probably a sign of being primitive and it's we're probably very slowly losing it 
[00:57:30]  and communicating soundly no they don't but when you ever see like hear alien accounts stories like  you know don't move they're all quiet they move i mean put a probe up your ass if they're not moving  no they move but they're not like no no expression oh then again that could be their alien spaceman  suits yes it could be it's all mental i think they have those tiny little mouths it's hard to see  him smile big eyes they can't even go he did he did he did he did he did he did he did he did he did  this is the commercial that uh he did he did he did howard stern right yeah of course bleeping 
[00:58:00]  hilarious on sirius xm they don't believe him they've got all kinds of comedy channels  wow okay you can't you can't time that you want an easy way to you can't time that that's not a half a  second it's too this guy down the hall drives me nuts you couldn't crap you couldn't hit a stopwatch  on and off that fast he pushed it like you know and and we're putting in the new commercial and i'm  thinking we got a big part i'm very happy we're uh actually before the million other names come out 
[00:58:30]  you want to see it again this is hold on this is a two-minute commercial i don't think we're on  screen for a third of a second so someone do the math hold on we'll just talk until i'm not going to  talk through the open anthony part door go ahead i just got something i want to get into okay um  but just just play that um i think it's important to realize that there's a lot of other people they  could have uh talked about and yeah all right that's done now we can really get into some other  show business this guy this guy sold it down the hall like oh whatever guys hey technically whatever 
[00:59:00]  if you look and then he won't understand why we're not happy with that i'm very happy with it oh  stop your horseshit if you look just as miserable as me below the giant get your f you money together  so we can have fun here i'm having a pisser if you look below the giant howard logo yeah and to the  left of the giant nhl logo where it says because now we're looking at a wall of logos i mean a wall 
[00:59:30]  of logos the virus is such a dumb name they won't call it the opium anthony channel that's just so  stupid it's to the left my left of the nhl so i can't even see the nhl one there's so many logos  on the screen see where the nfl is why are we supposed to be happy about this see nfl once our  name pops on oh i see the nfl and then under that is howard really i can't even oh i see howard okay  yeah and then under that is nhl you see that i see nhl now now look right next to it is 
[01:00:00]  is the writers okay yeah two mentions nice what oh yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah well that's a good  one well when he said we were going to be in the commercial you got to admit you were expecting  something maybe a little different than what what this is there is look freeze that's all i'm saying  can you can you see how long it's on screen for sure just something about the hottest show in the  history of that'd be nice yeah yeah let's see why don't you just look at the time on the 
[01:00:30]  and the guy doesn't like he doesn't down to the second we need less than one second and our logo  just pops up really quickly like they don't even like talk about it like they like this guy does with  other uh channels he how many did he name obviously his name howard but who else did he name well he  names a bunch margaritaville e street radio and then he said hip-hop 80s 90s uh and then this is comedy  this is pretty much like not being part of the commercial it's the same thing in my world on 
[01:01:00]  sirius xm they don't believe him they've got all kinds of comedy channels and a bazillion  with the foxhole and blue collar comedy did you get it yes how long i an estimate is uh 0.3 seconds  so so we're supposed to be happy about being in a commercial for 0.3 seconds and the commercials a  two-minute subliminal is much stronger that's true coming right everybody who sees this is 
[01:01:30]  going to go out to the lobby and buy coke during the intermission well hopefully man this is where  the angst and the frustration comes from because he sells it a different way to us we're sitting  down in the office like are you guys going to be uh a part of the the commercial that's going to be  airing any day now look we are technically i guess we are you think about it this way technically  when you're right that's how he would sell it yeah when you're flipping through the channels  how wait wait wait wait wait a third of a second one third who's good at math here i used to be 
[01:02:00]  i'm fantastic i was actually very good at math a third of a second you want a percentage percentage  of a two-minute commercial how what percentage of all right there's 120 seconds in two minutes  so um divide each second by a third which would be uh 120 seconds times three would be 360  one three hundred and sixtieth of the commercial yes one three sixtieth i could be wrong so what  would that booby i was never any good at math give me a bunch of meatballs some spaghetti i'm happy 
[01:02:30]  so what is that like that's point it's not good it's not a lot something percent  someone's saying one percent now it's impossible no it's not one percent yeah one percent wait one  percent because 120 seconds right so one percent of it would have to be over a second majors help us  out we're we're in the commercial for maybe point three uh of a second right point three of a second 
[01:03:00]  let's call it a third of a second make it easy yeah we're in there and and we're not it's less than a  third of a second now it's kind of lumped in with uh the other comedy channel as opposed to a  standalone mention someone's saying point two percent of the commercial point so point two  percent that's not two percent that's no point two point two percent that's under one percent  way under from the beginning yeah let me see the beginning of the commercial i wasn't paying  attention to the beginning of the commercials this guy was selling it like like wow you guys are  already going to be able to walk the streets when they you haven't got it because you're okay with 
[01:03:30]  regular oh my god so even though you really want satellite radio you haven't gotten it yet because  you're okay with regular radio really you're okay with this much radio even though there's this much  out there look now all now and get the best of sirius xm satellite radio free for 30 days yeah  we're talking commercial free music at the union live performances exclusive interviews  backstage and more a whole just a frank elvis grateful dead can tune into radio margaritaville 
[01:04:00]  e street radio hip-hop 80s 90s see where i'm going here oh and the sports like 24 hours a day sports  and sports talk every game every race everywhere say you're a vikings fan but you're visiting your  in-laws in arizona no worries you get all the games plus it's the only place you can find howard  stern personally i find the guy bleeping hilarious on sirius xm they don't believe him they've got  all kinds of comedy there we are in a bazillion other shows you can only find halfway through the 
[01:04:30]  commercial for point three of a second we're supposed to be jumping up and down get the  fuck out of here nice we never really needed advertising anyway but don't don't don't wave  this in front of me like this is a big deal does the foxhole have a lot of listeners i don't know  hell fucking no we fucking kicked their ass where's the boneyard i didn't like that they  don't mention that no they don't mention jimmy probably on the logo wall oh okay uh mike in  st louis is claiming he knows this shit mike all right cool you got your math i'm gonna meet you in 
[01:05:00]  st louis mike doesn't rhyme look at these percentages pop it hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on  look at these percentages popping up on the internet what are they all different but they're all just  horribly bad yeah they're all low oh two seven seven seven seven seven seven uh what do you got  mike if it's a two-minute commercial you're in there for one-sixth of one percent  six to one percent so you have to get six six we have to wait wait wait times more you'd be one 
[01:05:30]  percent yeah so if they pop that logo six times in the commercial at that at that length it would be one  percent of the commercial but they would have to pop it six times yeah see we only got it popped  one time only once lumped in with a bunch of other uh other channels i'll just say yeah thank you sir  but man he waved in front of us like this was like a big deal see we're moving we're moving forward 
[01:06:00]  with you guys they only put us uh it was only with three other shows in the comedy thing that's not  that they flashed on when he said and comedy and comedy we were yeah as he gave a little second or  two uh for every other channel who's the dorky guy yeah really i mean it sucks up the ying yang  really he's talking about hey man they know what they're doing with this marketing i just don't  like i don't know this shit we mentioned oprah and they mentioned martha stewart well we were only  looking looked at half the commercial didn't we no the second half of the commercial is about the 
[01:06:30]  technology oh we're not the devices and where's this running because i know rosie i watch a lot  of tv i haven't seen this on the logo it's not serious website oh it's not no i have no idea i  haven't seen it on tv wait oh my god i have no idea where it is i'm kidding i don't know if this  is why the less time in these hallways it's just way healthier for this radio show but wait there  were big names not mentioned like rosie martha and also we should i'm wondering if they're not  staying i mean because i weren't mentioned we should be you know fortunate they weren't even 
[01:07:00]  flashed yeah why wouldn't you promote that rosie was on the logo wall but oprah i don't see oprah  how many logos are on the logo wall i'll tell you a good amount of logos see you count the top and  then the side and then you because they're different sizes yeah count them all sam oh quick i was gonna  just do that and round it off we all would we're part of a fucking dummy especially it's gonna be hard  i'll do this too i moved the monitor oh goody gumdrops look at no he didn't sammy never loses 
[01:07:30]  it is good news that we're part of the the logo wall though that's good news holy  shit what how what are you up to right now 57 59 60  he's still counting oh my god i'll say there's uh at least part of the logo wall that's good  200 what number are you up to now on the logo you can't you can't you can't process all these  logos i'd say there's a hundred and eighty yeah five 185 what are you up to now 109 okay 
[01:08:00]  16 15 32 86 89 93 exactly come on dork 100 103 105 107 117 29 2 106 5 18 19 33  142 logos the logo king all right you did it the logo king is that what you're going by now it's a 
[01:08:30]  dumb name kind of like our name except it's an h and an m uh bobby in alabama bobby he's a homo  just let you know the fat chick in the lover boy video had more air time than you  oh he's right uh bobby you're a couple of weeks oh he's right you gotta linger longer on that but  fuck i think she beat us out hey man you freeze frame it looks like it's a commercial about us  oh yeah comedy comedy the opian anthony all right enough of that there it is it was just presented 
[01:09:00]  to me in such a way that is so different than what it actually is nice hey uh and so you were  talking about your app it does all that stuff amazing i love the app it's the future uh you  hear about the std app std i think they're testing this yeah british uh health officials are hard at  work on a new app that will allow users to pee into their cell phones and to find out within 
[01:09:30]  minutes if they have an std now be fucking up your phone you're not literally gonna piss in your  cell phone there must be some type of attachment attachment is that what you're thinking according to  guardian blah blah blah the english papers are all lying here's what's gonna happen you're gonna  attach something that analyzes your piss yeah um and then it's going to just send the information  to your phone right okay yeah you guys and everybody else a smartphone app that will allow  users to put urine or saliva onto a computer chip about the size of a usb chip both at the same time 
[01:10:00]  for jimmy it's a urine and saliva it's in your mouth uh plug it into their phone or computer and  receive a diagnosis within minutes uh your mobile phone could be your mobile doctor it diagnoses whether  you've got one of a range of stis such as chlamydia or gonorrhea and tells you where to go next to  get treatment oh that's pretty cool what about the big one though come on age they say they can detect 
[01:10:30]  but let's go with the head they can detect that in saliva i think maybe it's not as full dr steve would  know um yeah all saliva will carry the virus but it it dies instantly um not good for transmission but  if you just want to get a general idea um you gotta do a you do a swab test then you just kind of  wipe it on a petri dish let's ferment you know and put a wine label on it yeah you put a wine label 
[01:11:00]  on it that's good fuck you but the reality is that's a good one yeah maybe dr kaku can uh explain it  exactly what he would say oh yeah holy shit oh yeah you're gonna notice a nodule on your app  dr humor dr humor  let's say hi to andrew in boston andrew and what's up boys hey man hey hope i want to know is it std 
[01:11:30]  or std's ah std's i might have to bring in some of my music fucking tapes when i was a music jock  shut up man chlamydia is a place the committee is on the radio on the radio that was it shut up  bopi and anthony's on the commercial forget it past what was the line shut up the black crows are on  no the crows are on the radio just the crows hey why are you still talking man the crows are on the radio  did i explain what that was all about you couldn't there's no need to 
[01:12:00]  vandersloot was more enjoyable to listen to in that interview well this people that's unless you'd  hit your head there were there are people though that like when we go inside i think i told jimmy  on the way home i was playing it that way because i was so panicked that they were going to find out  they were that me and aunt were really old and we were talking to teenagers like it supposedly the demo  was like really supposedly it was 18 to 34 but it was more like 12 to 24 12 to 25 whatever that demo 
[01:12:30]  is right we would have teenage girls with braces showing up at our gig so i'm like if they know  we're actually time of my life if they know that we're actually a lot older than than that demo  middle age so wait so instead of like uh old cool guys you want to be young fags  oh i know i know there's nothing i could actually say in the end miserably married but i'm like well  if we could kind of sound younger maybe they'll believe that we're actually younger yeah i i think 
[01:13:00]  it took two years before we even told anyone that aunt was married we were scared if if they knew one of  the guys was married that i was hoping i it would just i not mentioning it would make it go away  yeah we were in a weird spot up there yeah whatever very odd trust me beat me up all you  want i i deserve it but i'm just trying to give you a a little bit of an explanation on it it's so  funny to listen to what um the apps there was something apps uh somebody's got an intern's got 
[01:13:30]  to go out for me um at some point uh get uh yeah send stevie okay you know what i want i want black  i want black ops i want the video game when do the stores open call of duty right the new call of  duty new call of duty black ops you think stevie can handle it yeah negative i think so do you  honestly think i think i'm gonna give stevie one more chance where is wait wait wait can i can i 
[01:14:00]  help you out with this how far is the store that he has to go to either uh best buyer borders but  how far is it from here it's only like four blocks four blocks why don't we why don't we if he could  do it within a certain amount of time let's give him something for it yeah how about not a punch in  the face exactly how long you think this task should take kenny kenny and are they open now  i don't think they're open yet okay nine o'clock all right nine o'clock they open i'm sorry 
[01:14:30]  to say this would be an empty exercise so the stores open at nine when i was an intern my first  day i had to get you a video game yes you did which game was that i believe it was one of the star  wars pc games yes it was um it was before the best buy was open i think so it was a little more  complicated and i think you sent me at 9 30 and gave me till the end of the show yes and i got back  back as but after the show but before you went home before i went home it was right when i was 
[01:15:00]  leaving you went here you go and you know that there is not a lot of time between yes show and  and you going home leaving right so i still got credit i think stevie should have 25 minutes 25  minutes because best i mean now it's even easier because best buy so well if you want to make it even  easier there's a game stop in rockefeller center right across the street oh my god 15 minutes then  well let's cut the difference 20 20 minutes now do you think he'll be able to actually get it right 
[01:15:30]  not there's another thing oh yes oh yes he will when does it when because i need black ops for for  my get you modern warfare yeah of course he will when does the store open nine or uh probably not  so whenever the store opens right at that second he goes and then we'll time there because i think he  should leave it's such a popular game uh if you have not pre-ordered you're going to need to be  there within like the first hour i would think yeah and you don't think if he leaves here at nine  o'clock he'll be there by ten there's not no not a chance not a chance i have no doubt that he's 
[01:16:00]  gonna fuck this i i have no doubt he's gonna fuck this up i think he won't i think he remains untested  i think untested yes he's fucked up every errand we should have to run we should send an intern to  best buy to actually get you the game and send stevie i'm getting intel best buy opened at midnight  just for this game i don't know are they open right now did they stay open throughout the night  though or did they do a minute and other people thinking that it might be sold out already well 
[01:16:30]  it might be but we don't know union square how about stevie leaves right now and tries to figure it  out stevie go you have stevie here you go come here watch this how much does it cost this is  even better i don't know 60 do you have a cell phone yeah how does an answer so call us or we  better answer your phone when we call you stevie with no instructions yeah here's how creative you  have to be yeah it is now whatever time it is here uh 7 7 37 7 37 a.m uh i don't know what's open 
[01:17:00]  i don't know what's not open and nobody's gonna help you and no one's helping you if you've listened  you already hear where you could go right i am giving you a 100 bill right here and uh i want you to  pick me up black ops now do you do you understand what this is video game he's right he's right he  does all right that's good at it i told you he's untested oh oh my god i'm never getting this

[01:18:30]  that's an easy hundred stevie it's an easy hundred here's the deal if you bring that back to me  here before the i'll even give you to the end of the show because i don't think he'll do it  wow i don't think he'll do it it's two and a half hours yeah i know i know i don't think he's gonna  be able to do it you could keep the change whoa from the hundred okay you have 140 minutes that's a  lot of pressure that's not that's a lot of pressure it's new york city it's the pinnacle of the free

[01:25:00]  uh for uh sam yeah we got our spies all over the place oh no what now plj they have a bed bug parody  song whoa bugs are very hot as far as new york city goes i need that parody song immediately well  i'll see what i can do i'm trying to think of what they would have done it to bed bugs living in my face  oh i can't wait to hear the shoehorn fucking lyrics on this one that's a rock-headed idiot 
[01:25:30]  if someone has a bed bugs uh parody song you know we have to play oh hell yes what song could it be  too yeah i'm trying to think um it has to be a pop song obviously something yeah yeah why are we trying  to figure it out like it's going to make any sense true it's going to be shoehorned it's not going to  work it'll probably do it to you or something all right we'll break and hopefully have the bed 
[01:26:00]  bugs song next and some other things  oh that's unbelievable we're trying to figure out the uh the trip play that happened at a middle  school football game that is amazing because i guess you don't have to i guess you don't have to 
[01:26:30]  yell hike right  huh  wait explain this for the radio hysterical play like uh everyone is checking this out cnn just  showed the video they line up it's a middle school football game so they're all lined up 
[01:27:00]  calling it the greatest trick play in football history it's amazing uh and the offense uh is all  set the center doesn't give the quarterback the ball between his legs he kind of picks it up with one  hand and gives it to him sideways like off to his side over his shoulder over his shoulder kind of the  the quarterback just kind of grabs the ball and and slowly walks across the line of scrimmage through  the defenders because they all stand up like what was there a penalty did something because he's not

[01:43:00]  from that location give him 15 minutes 25 minutes later that's the location he was in without getting  to the story i know how inept he is really that's why i'm like give him the whole show he's not gonna  be able to do this but here's the problem now we're a man down and all of the tasks the important things  that stevie was going to get done for the show what does stevie actually do well sometimes kenny  has him stand outside the studio on guard on guard he's blind yes how is he not very strong 
[01:43:30]  no no he's a dunce oh god all right um what are we doing we don't have the bed bugs parody song  uh no but damn scott and todd is being monitored so if they know it's good for him they'll never play  that song again true we got jackson's uh kids on oprah oprah's getting fucking everybody for her  last year yeah i'm finding myself watching oprah almost every day oh oh i hear you isn't she 
[01:44:00]  entertaining oh she talks to everybody this one what are you gonna do yeah it's gonna have bush on  yeah oh she having georgia she's gonna have georgie on george w has been going around uh with  his book there is a memoirs and uh you know what a lot of people are liking this guy these days  it's amazing he goes on these shows and he comes off as a likable fellow he's a great politician yeah  i was never a bush fan but he's coming across a bit lovable when he's not the president people seem 
[01:44:30]  to like him when he's not the president when he doesn't have dick cheney near him he explained his  uh his stance on uh why he became as pro-life as he did oh really it's true to his mother  drunk with a hanger one night no his mother had a miscarriage and she showed him the fetus in a jar  ah and i guess fetus in a jar and uh but he looked at it and he goes that's a life like she i think  she said that's a life and he goes that that could have been like a little brother drank it 
[01:45:00]  sent it off into the military but i mean it's like he did explain why he was kind of like that  yeah yeah he is coming off as a lot more likable he seems like a fun guy when he doesn't have any  power he's not any power you're right he's the funniest of the ex-presidents yeah he's the guy  i would most of all the ex-presidents i think i'd have the most fun talking to him yeah more than  clinton even yeah and his uh he he really gets in depth into what he was feeling during uh 9 11 and uh  the war and uh the weapons of mass destruction that weren't there the whole kanye west incident 
[01:45:30]  wow you know we should forget that he said it was one of the worst things that happened during his  presidency when kanye said he doesn't care about black people one of the worst things that he said  presidency one of the worst things that happened during my presidency is when kanye west you know  implied i was a racist but the best part of that video is stupid michael myers just standing there  awkwardly he doesn't know what to do yeah why would he why would he speak up and just go what  you've seen the i forgot that about that video did you see the video michael myers yeah that's not 
[01:46:00]  on that that's not on the teleprompter we had uh michael myers teleprompter prompter how do you  say prompter i want to prompt somebody teleprompter figure it's about time i say words right i'll be  happy to correct you thank you start doing that yeah look at michael myers he's like landscape of  the city has changed dramatically tragically and perhaps irreversibly there's now over 25 feet of  water where there was once city streets they want to ride neighborhoods pause so mike uh myers does 
[01:46:30]  his part perfectly yes he does it perfectly with his jfk hairdo holy shit and if you're looking at  kanye yeah like kanye knows he's like he's like he's winding up i'm not gonna read that cue card no  motherfucker and kanye yeah he's like fuck that wait till this happens listen to this i hate the way  they portray us in the media look at mine he's like that's not a car they're looting see a white  family it says they're looking for food and you know it's been five days because most of the people 
[01:47:00]  are black and even for me to complain about i will be a hypocrite because i've tried to  turn away from the teacher tv because it's too hard to watch i've even been shopping before even giving  a donation so now i'm calling my business manager right now to see what's what is the  biggest amount i can give and and just to imagine if i was if i was down there and those are those  are my people down there so anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can help with with the 
[01:47:30]  setup the way america is set up to help yeah baby he should just start doing that the black people  the less well off as slow as possible i mean this is red cross is doing everything they can we we  already realize a lot of the people that could help are shakes his head for red cross right now  fighting another way and they they've given them permission to go down and shoot us what  and subtle but in even many ways  and now he rubs his nose and then he reads what was written for him and he's trying to read he's 
[01:48:00]  like Kanye west is going on and on my your instinct is to nod but mike meyer's like i better not nod for  any of this because i don't know where he's going they give him permission to shoot us right it's like  uh muhammina hummina ed norton deep sigh and then back to reading yeah everyone focuses on  kanye in this clip but no the beauty is looking at mike meyer's trying to handle this he is the funniest 
[01:48:30]  because he keeps looking at him like i i won't look as awkward if i just nod at this listen when  he nodded at the red cross part when kanye stops talking and mike comes back in he is flustered  you can hear it and then he goes back to just reading what's on the card  and subtle but in even many ways more subtle but in many many ways you can read his mind he's basically  in his mind going holy shit why am i the guy next to him shit he's doing it if i trip up my careers over 
[01:49:00]  how does this clip end and subtle but in even many ways more profoundly devastating is the lasting  damage to the survivor's will to rebuild and remain in the area the destruction of the spirit  may end up being the most tragic loss of all george bush doesn't care about black people  why did you just say that this clip is his i forgot how funny this is it's the greatest clip i forgot 
[01:49:30]  how funny this what makes it funny is to just break it down mike's like holy shit what the fuck are you  doing to me man oh i haven't had a hit movie in five years leave me alone he turned he i he turned 90  degrees and looked directly at kanye like what yes jimmy no i'm i'm thinking of his reaction oh it's i'm in  the middle on this one like i kind of like that kanye said that really it's hard to argue when people 
[01:50:00]  were down there just being fucking in the astrodome it was it was handled horribly i'm not even looking  at this uh politically i just think it's hilarious it's very hilarious might look at mike myers's game  is great that's what i love about this is that mike had no fucking clue this was going down and he's  just like what the fuck dude you also have to respect that kanye west can go out and act like a dickhead  wherever he goes and do stuff like this and he still sells millions and millions of cds yeah  he's never penalized for it either so he's never penalized for it never mike myers can't go on tv 
[01:50:30]  and say that uh george bush doesn't know he'd never make a movie again like black kanye's never been bigger  yeah go back again because the look mike myers gives when he turns toward him like what the  fuck that's just it's it's priceless this clip well to rebuild and remain in the area the  destruction of the spirit of the people of southern louisiana and mississippi may end up being the  most tragic loss of all george bush doesn't care about black people oh my god then they just cut  the camera and chris chris tucker's like uh he's been at the cellar a lot lately tucker yeah is he 
[01:51:00]  funny i haven't seen one i know he's funny in movies i'm just saying yeah he was just stand-up so he's  getting back in a stand-up how uh but isn't that but when you listen to mike myers on mike myers  uninspired nonsense that he's reading there's no life to that no and and the destruction of the  spirit and he just comes right out with it george bush doesn't care about black people  george bush doesn't care about black people i'm not i'm not really a fan of kanye but i respect that 
[01:51:30]  yeah at least he was honest i think with these uh award shows and all that they should just make  these people if they're that talented go out there and say some and speak your mind just say some shit  guy was speaking ignorant shit yeah whatever he was i love kanye west fuck him at that moment i liked  him fuck him taylor swift he annoyed me but that moment he was right to say that just that no he  was george bush doesn't like black people doesn't care doesn't care about black people i'm not saying 
[01:52:00]  that bush it was it was 100 accurate to say it but the way it was handled was but if we but but if  if we go back to that time again you know you can look back in hindsight but uh if you go back to  that whole thing no everyone thinks the whole the country and the government is always prepared and  ready we saw what happened on 9 11 we saw what happened with katrina it's not the government  can't be there as your mommy and daddy to fucking take care of you when something goes wrong we'd like  to think it does we'd like to think the response is is instantaneous during disasters it's not and the 
[01:52:30]  motherfuckers i i should i should have should have fucking left i think everybody said should have  fucking left should have uh heeded the warnings and and there was looting going on and it wasn't just  white people that were uh taking stuff and saying they're feeding their families and black people  looting and saying they're looting if a white person's taking the television they're not fucking  feeding themselves if they're going into a store to get food yes then they're not looting they're  feeding themselves but if you're taking a fucking big case of uh heineken and crossing the lower river 
[01:53:00]  with it you're looting and you're right it's not instantaneous but there's a line between not  instantaneous and five days like there's a balance in there and bush admitted he didn't do it right  yeah yeah he should have he should have touched down could have been handled better but i don't  think it was because of anybody's hatred toward a fucking race not just stop it there isn't this  blatant fucking racism that that kept help from getting down there i don't didn't i don't think  it was a hatred no but i do think that it was handled terribly look it was handled terribly called federal 
[01:53:30]  emergency management something look that's what taxes are for i mean we pay taxes and you have the  right to expect the government to react when it is a a flood situation i have the right to  absolutely agree with you that it was handled horribly but i don't think what kanye was saying  is it was handled horribly because of racism that's not the truth logistically that was a pain in the  ass they couldn't people couldn't get out you think it's that easy for people to get in you remember 
[01:54:00]  there were helicopters flying over fucking cutting roofs open helping people you can't just drive any  vehicle in there it was flooded it's not like everybody thought it was so accessible how the  military could get in they got equipment can i ask you something am yeah now you get we got the black  guy with that love that guy the heineken heineken looter he's been on every let's say let's say  ever let's say there's a major disaster in new york city god forbid and uh you know people just  can't get food beer electricity come true all that do you believe white people would go and do the 
[01:54:30]  same exact thing and loot stores yes absolutely okay good yeah thank god if people start starving  and shit thank god you said yes i think the only reason you saw more black people was because the  population is more black people down there that's why i think the response to that though is really  bad yeah but i don't think it was racially based it's hard i i'm not going to say it is but it's hard  to it's hard to make it's like when you see the way other tragedies or the urgency the government 
[01:55:00]  has responded to other things and the way they handled that and it's like it's one more time  to go oh no it wasn't right i'm not saying that they all said hey fuck niggers we're not going to  help them but it's like i it might have contributed to some kind of an indifference because there was  other families that i think were getting better attention than they were five days is inexcusable  i i just cannot see it that way i can't see it as being racially based uh the reason why why help  wasn't sent in uh in a timely fashion i just think it was logistics and ray nagan is black by the way 
[01:55:30]  the mayor of of new orleans uh was black and he was incompetent and he did a terrible job i'm talking  about the government the federal government not ray nagan how about we go with the the recent one  the oil spill you would think they would have had a hell of a lot more going on another thing just  like people yelling and screaming when are they gonna fucking start cleaning this shit up why are they  bringing in you know the heavy equipment and and the big uh big ships but there weren't people  drowning with the oil the oil spill was horrible but there was not the immediate threat to fucking 
[01:56:00]  people like being holed up in the astrodome i mean that was a an immediate threat to a lot of people  right it was handled the government has the ability to respond a certain way and we it was like if they  were just trying to come in and i just think the way that the government responded i was watching what  the fuck are they doing yeah it's like it was like a non-response and because they were worried about  other stuff and they knew it was coming look let's these people who were stuck there were not  exactly rich people i mean it's hard to just uproot and leave everything when you know you're going to  be ripped off uh there's a lot of people that don't leave an area when it gets when volcanoes 
[01:56:30]  yeah and look what happens they die yeah they die they do but it's what happens and the weather's  wrong the news is wrong so much i think a lot of people just didn't have the fucking means  to leave everything and then come back and find out all this shit has been taken i think they took  things a little too lightly probably right i think a lot of people looked at it and said oh another  hurricane yeah whatever probably and uh you know they were warned about the levees and and  it hit and flooded the place and you couldn't get shit in or out at that point the media got in 
[01:57:00]  the media was there in a day and a half whatever it was like if it was two and a half days two days i  would agree with you 100 i'd go you're right it's just it was a tough one to respond to but the length  of time got to the point where i can't see it being racial where's the upside of of not sending  help in because of race where's the upside of a government to not send help in based on race  it's not i don't think it's ever looked at like that like nobody says hey kanye said it no no but 
[01:57:30]  i'm talking about the people i don't fuck him i'm talking about the people who are doing it i don't  think anybody's actually going fuck the spooks i think it's more subtle than that because there was  other people uh that needed to be helped there was a lot of white families and they were in an  easier location i just think the sense of urgency was less uh i think a lot of times you don't  actually speak that stuff out no no one in the room actually says that it just is and it's you know  you know it's like certain you can't win the argument in court you know how we know certain 
[01:58:00]  things about this fucking guy running this mosque we know yeah where his heart really is but you  can't prove it in court i mean maybe that's a too extreme an example but sometimes you can't point  to this is the exact proof just to make it your argument right so is there a a a a a conspiracy  of of people or is it one guy that wasn't giving the order to to do something or or the head all  the heads of fema and and like what what i think obviously i also think the poverty level is a big 
[01:58:30]  part of it too the fact that it's a very poor area poor people always going to get less help than  rich people i mean that's the reality i agree i completely agree with uh class based yes then  race based any day a lot of the people that could help are i think if uh thank you kanye i think if  uh he had something to say yeah i think a bunch of guys are in a room fema and they're talking about  what to do with these funds and they have a few areas to hit they're like we got to get down there  they're all no one is saying i don't care about those fucking those fucking blacks in that fucking 
[01:59:00]  astrodome or wherever they were the uh superdome yeah but they were like but first we got to get  to this place we got to get to this place let's send these people here to mississippi it's just  done like that nobody in the room and if you asked them they would deny it probably even in themselves  but the reality is you watched what happened i think it's a combo both i really do i think you're  both making good points i think uh it does depend on how much money you got but i also think we  were caught with a i hate to say it like this with our fucking pants down yeah but if they knew it 
[01:59:30]  the government knew it but look at like when jfk jr went missing over fucking the ocean what they  did to find him the because he had so because of who he was and how much fucking money he was worth  yeah just to throw him back obviously that old guy but you know you got to make sure the ships are  out there look at how they respond to the california fires people lose homes but i mean they really  fucking respond and you know that they're doing their multi-million dollar homes right everything 
[02:00:00]  they can god if lindsay lohan lost their house or something that's tragedy i could i don't disagree  booby i could bring it back very local like i i bike in the park all the time central park right  and uh upper west side and the upper east side of the park is beautiful and i do the whole loop so i  have to go all the way up to like the harlem area whoa and you notice how much how the they don't take  care of the park as well up there and that's a poor area it's it's obvious to me and poor people  don't a lot of times make their case any better either because they mistreat their areas and they 
[02:00:30]  would say well it's a culture of not feeling like you have anything so you know whatever their  argument would be well break the culture and take care of the park i agree a lot of times poor people  don't make it any easier on themselves by pissing in their own elevators it's like come on guys stop  all of a sudden the fields aren't as nice yeah the bike paths themselves are a little i'm serious i see  it oh yeah you know my little dumb exercise i see every day right now i'm sure you're paying a lot  more taxes where you live than they are up there right uh and that money will be allocated to your 
[02:01:00]  parts and not to their part you could ride up the hudson river on a bike path it is fucking beautiful  and smooth on the upper west side but you get a little too far north i'm telling you man your  tires are popping from the glass and the bolts and the and the shitty pavement i just i and i don't  like you notice it it changed like like instantly yeah i think he's a coddled baby and i think that he  gets away with things that a white performer would never get away with no i'm just saying in that 
[02:01:30]  instance i agree with i like the fact that he went off book and said what he wanted to say  because mike myers was reading that uninspired dreck that was written oh and the loss of spirit  that fucking nonsense that lip service apple and kanye got a reaction kanye certainly did and i think  kanye's a twat basically i really do i think the fact that he took that from taylor swift somebody  should have knocked his teeth out for it yeah took a little moment but once again it comes back to  mike myers right area just like what are you doing to me right more important than anything oh yeah 
[02:02:00]  is mike myers face during that has that what what the but i just trying to do the right thing here  why do i have to be a part of this just trying to raise a little money for some people kanye  oh jeez uh uh is this uh blind oh let's see an hour later 55 minutes let's see it's okay 55 minutes  all right yep sam's laughing something's wrong something has to be the mic is right the mic the  mic the mic the mic it's a bad time stevie handed him something hi buddy why are you out of breath

[02:25:00]  did it  or say  I love  that show  you know  I love  Letterman  you should  go on  there again  nothing  they don't  want to  give out  compliments  for some  reason  we have  the weirdest  fans  in entertainment  go on  O&A  again  a simple  command  if you  know  what's  fucking  good for  you  go on  O&A  again  maybe it  applies  maybe you'll  learn to  do it  maybe you'll  get good  at it  they like  you  they don't  know how  to say  it  they don't  have  Asperger's  bunch of  dopes  but they  do love  you  they don't  want to  compliment us  for some 
[02:25:30]  reason  I don't know  why  half the time  I don't even  know if they're  our fans  I get very  confused  you have  arguments with  some of these  people  I'm like  I'm just  a fan  I'm like  how are you  a fan  I don't  understand  you haven't  said anything  to me  that indicates  that you're  an actual fan  complimentary  you know  they like you  because they're  not spitting  on you  sometimes  really weird  I just thought  it's a very  subtle thing  I don't know  what it means  but I say  your show 
[02:26:00]  gets commented  on as much  as any other  show  but never  they don't  like adjectives  they don't  like adverbs  they don't  by simple  command  here's what  you do  that's pretty  much our  audience  radio  God bless  them  God bless  them  why are you  in town  you got  something  going on  kind of  sort of  the big  thing is  that Teller  is opening  a show  called Play  Dead  down at the  Players Theater 
[02:26:30]  on McDougal  it's a  you know  it's a spook  show  it's an  adult  at least  say  minstrel  show  we don't  like using  that language  here  we're going  to see  Teller singing  Minnie the  Moocher  and it's  they're doing  a big scary  resurrecting  the dead  you know  like  really  a show  yeah  you know  mind reading  and good  magic tricks  a guy named  Todd Robbins  who you may  know  he's a geek  eats glass  does he speak 
[02:27:00]  in it or no  yeah  Teller's not  in the show  Teller directed  it and wrote  it then he  goes back to  Vegas to  make money  to make  the real  money  but it's  great  I'll be  seeing  I'll be  seeing the  opening  Wednesday  you might  have to  check that  out  you should  you should  go by  it sounds  like a  kind of  old school  old school  but also  has nudity  you can't go  wrong with that  a hot  a hot woman  covered with  blood  that  probably  Teller's  idea  yeah  it was  yeah  that's why 
[02:27:30]  I love  watching bullshit  too because  through the  the information  you get from  it  occasionally  you do see  a nice  nude piece  of ass  there  well you know  when we did  the vaccination  show  Showtime  didn't want  to do the  vaccination  show  and they  said you  it's not  really sexy  and I said  well I'll  get you  a nude  playmate  to talk  about  vaccinations  I got a son  he's six months  old today  actually  the vaccination  thing  scared the shit  out of all  of us  I didn't  see that  bullshit  and just  a quick  little summary  what you learned 
[02:28:00]  the quick  summary is  you don't  want your  son to get  whooping cough  or smallpox  get them all  so you have  no fucking  choice  really  you have  no choice  at all  and you  don't want  a choice  I mean  if you  were living  in a time  without  vaccinations  it is all  you would  want  right  and it's  it's the  great  and there's  this anti-vaccination  thing that  started on  very bad  science  the Wakefield  studies  out of  out of  Britain  and it's  total  complete  and utter  bullshit  but most  the bullshit 
[02:28:30]  wastes  people's  money  and it's  kind of  funny  the vaccination  bullshit  kills babies  kills children  and did you  go after  Jenny McCarthy  yeah  we sure did  good for you  what we did  was  good for  fucking you  we said  all Jenny McCarthy  has going for  was she was a  playboy model  and people  are listening to her  so we have  we had a playboy  centerfold  who came out  topless  but the great  thing was  it was kind  of an odd  moment because  one of the  writers  his son  is autistic 
[02:29:00]  so we brought  out a playboy  model to  explain the  science  and she was  topless  explaining the  science  and we also  brought out  our friend's  son who's  10 years old  who's autistic  so we had  brought a  10 year old  autistic child  on the set  with a  you know  with a  pair of  44 double  D's  how do you  sell that  to showtime  in the meeting  like look  we got the  autistic kid  we got the  girl with  great tits  it's handled  we would never 
[02:29:30]  be able to  get that done  and we brought  the writer out  and his line  the big laugh  line was  eyes front  son  and you know  that was supposed  to be the joke  but as you guys  know very well  when you're doing  something that's  supposed to be a  joke you sometimes  have to actually  do it  so while you're  doing this  you're going  he's going  you know that  lady doesn't  have a shirt  on  she doesn't  that's kind  of the joke  well what's  the joke  well the joke 
[02:30:00]  is that you're  a child  and you're  I think what  we're doing  is very very  wrong  just stand there  just suffice to  say it's wrong  nice  and the great  thing was  that the  playboy model  that we got  to read  the stuff  read the  whole study  on prompter  and then  turned to me  and asked me  the questions  that she had  just answered  reading the  prompter  she read  the prompter  I guess  phonetically  zero comprehension  no comprehension 
[02:30:30]  and then just  asked me  and I went  well it's on  the prompter  when was the  study discredited  well you just  said it  you just said it  that's awesome  can you imagine  it if we try  to get that  get that done  no  autistic kid  10 years old  we couldn't get  either one of those  things  a girl with great  tits  couldn't get a  girl with great  tits  and autism  or an autistic  if we said  one of the  either  pick one  because they're  both money  on the radio  I certainly 
[02:31:00]  bow to Penn  Gillette  because he gets  shit done  he doesn't have  to deal with  lawyers in this  corporate crap  lawyers are  really really  important on  bullshit  eight years  eight years  of then there's  this asshole  and we've never  been successfully  sued  but you'd love  the notes that  our lawyers make  because  one of the  reasons  your lawyers  are different  than ours  we need your  lawyers  one of the  reasons we say  motherfucker so much  and one of the  reasons we invented  the term  cunt pickle  was you're trying 
[02:31:30]  not to say  liar  because liar  is actionable  so we get  notes  in our script  that say  and I love this  you know  from the legal  department  in a little square  with a stamp  on it  can't you call  this guy  a motherfucker  because  and you also  can't say  a product  doesn't work  right  like if you  say a product  you can say  it's a piece  of shit  but you can't  say it doesn't  work  exactly  yeah  that's where  you get sued  so we 
[02:32:00]  you know  Al Goldstein  who I just  visited in the  veterans hospital  yesterday  I saw your tweet  about that  he's not doing  well  no  he was homeless  for a while  you know  one of these  heroes  of free speech  you know  the Topeka  versus Goldstein  case  amazing  and now  he's in  you know  I got him  out of the  homeless shelter  and got him  a place to stay  he got himself  in a position  where he was homeless  was screw not  making money  for a long time  screw you know  screw kind of  started doing  less well  and Al is crazy  and pisses off  a lot of people 
[02:32:30]  I mean watch  watch the trajectory  of Al Goldstein  because we're all  heading down it  but he was in the  he was in the  you know  he was in the  he was in the  veterans hospital  and I went to  visit him  and he's doing  okay there  he's got some  you know  he's old  and got some  problems  yeah I remember  when he was  self-destructing  here in New York  a few years back  wow  but you know  I just  I just  I just  I just love Al  and I went  you know  I went up with Ratso  you know  Ratso Sloman  who wrote the  Stern books 
[02:33:00]  with him  and wrote the  David Blaine book  with him and stuff  wonderful writer  and friend of  Bob Dylan's  and stuff  and you know  I was there  with Ratso  you know  on the elevator  on the elevator  of the veterans  hospital  you know  which is  could be considered  by some  to be a depressing  place  yeah  and  we're on  the elevator  I look over  at Ratso  and you know  Ratso is  a creep  right  and I can see  myself in the mirror  and I go  holy fuck  I'm a creep  because you know 
[02:33:30]  when I was like  when I was like  18  you know  the long hair  and the being  enormous  and that kind of  stuff  it was kind of like  well he's a kid  he's a crazy kid  but now you know  Ratso's 62  and I'm 55  and I go  holy fuck  I'm the guy  you're scared of  in the park  and now I'm  in the veterans  you know  hospital elevator  and I'm thinking  you know  Al Goldstein  used to eat  at Le Cirque  with porn stars  and now the only  two people  that visit him  are Ratso 
[02:34:00]  and Pat  and I'm just  telling you man  if things happen  bad to you  and the two people  that love you  left of the world  are Ratso and Pat  just kill yourself  that's a problem  but Al Goldstein  told me a long ago  he said  whenever you're mad  at somebody  in public  don't ever  say liar  don't ever  say cheat  say motherfucker  say cocksucker  because if you  go to court  it's harder  for them  to bring that up  I'm not a  motherfucker  I didn't fuck  my mother  what did he mean 
[02:34:30]  by motherfucker  did he mean liar  well he meant  he really didn't  like you  when you pissed  him off  it's much safer  so you have to be  for lawsuits  so our lawyers  right in the margin  call this guy  a motherfucker  that's great  lawyers there  to protect the show  the great thing  was after 8 years  whenever it airs  85, 90 shows  we had one  editorial comment  from a lawyer  that had nothing  to do with advice  or anything  and that was  on the show  about pyramid schemes 
[02:35:00]  which we were not  allowed to say  pyramid  we couldn't say  pyramid scheme  we had to say  multi-level marketing  you couldn't say Ponzi  you couldn't say Ponzi  either  so the only thing  we could do  was do a whole  Egyptian scene  with me going to tell  what are those things  behind us  and then going on  about it  and we did a whole thing  about social security  and I went  you know social security  this many people pay in  and then we can pay out  this is where it starts  I don't know why  I'm saying this  on a show about  multi-level marketing 
[02:35:30]  rip-offs  I guess it's kind of  a non sequitur  and the lawyer  wrote in the margin  hey wait a minute  social security  is a Ponzi scheme  that was a lawyer's company  there's never going to  be enough people  to pay in  to pay off  who's in there  and it collapses  but I like that  the lawyer  discovers that at work  going to a show  from your show  wait a minute  all the schooling  and everything  meant nothing  just watch an episode 
[02:36:00]  of bullshit  that one was really good  because it was the whole  that guy that was  selling that beverage  oh it was so sad  wasn't it  and his meeting  and he's trying to get  other people  into this product  with him  because it's never made  selling the product  it's supposed to be made  getting other people  that are your  underlings  you couldn't say pyramid  though huh  could not say  the word pyramid  because there's things  like Amway  and other things  you know you have to say  multi-level marketing 
[02:36:30]  right  multi-level marketing  because if you say pyramid  it's like saying a liar  and you're in all sorts of trouble  oh it's a bad thing  yeah  and uh  but  the math behind that  was fascinating  and no matter how many times  I've seen that  uh take on it  I watch and go  how can anyone  not see this  at level seven  you have to be  selling your shit  to every human being  on the planet  the math is  stunning to watch  it gets bad  really quickly  it's that exponential thing 
[02:37:00]  exponential  exponential will fuck your shit  okay see you tomorrow  didn't you get involved  in one of these  no  pyramid  no no  I was uh  the really lame one  with the money  you told that story  once  I think my mom did  once  with pilots  and stewardesses  I've never gotten  where you had to get people  to just give you money  remember that one  I never got involved in that  I got taken to an Amway  meeting once though 
[02:37:30]  and it's that whole  secretive thing  that was like  yeah it's a business  proposition  proposition  I'm like what is it  we'll tell you  you gotta get there  just get in a suit  and  but the thing that really  was so heartbreaking  the guy selling the  shit drink  is he's a really good guy  and he wants to work  really hard  you know  in the way we lay out  the show  he's in the villain  category  but he's not  he's absolutely  completely a victim  all he wants to do  you know  it's bad economic times 
[02:38:00]  he wants to work  his ass off  he's willing to invest  money  willing to work  his ass off  and they're just  eating him for breakfast  you know  they're just  it's horrible  yeah the  when he was having  that meeting  with the other gentleman  to try to  persuade him  into joining the ranks  it was the saddest thing  this guy had no game  no game  no but he didn't even  bring the drink  with him  which is the big hit  here you bring it  I'm going to sell you  something  and I don't bring it  with me  we got this great drink  we're going to sell 
[02:38:30]  oh do you have the drink  no  no  and obviously  it's part of the script  to not bring the drink  with you  yeah don't bring it  I wonder why  because the drink sucks  terrible  there's no mystery here  I can't sell this shit  you would bring it  if it's a good product  you're proud of  sound doesn't sound good  come in a tumbler  probably be better  hey how's Christopher Hitchens  doing I know you guys  are friends  is he  I haven't  I'm so afraid  I write him an email  now and again  how you're doing  and he writes back  I have cancer  you don't have that 
[02:39:00]  kind of thing  and he started to do this  I probably shouldn't  even say this  because people  could misinterpret it  but it strikes me  so funny  I'll say to him  I'm going to be down  in DC  will I be able  to get together  with you  he always writes  if Allah wills it  oh shit  and I think he's  just doing it  as a joke  to make me think  that maybe  he's lost his mind  but you know  as we all know  when you do jokes  long enough  to make people  think you've lost  your mind  it soon becomes  indistinguishable 
[02:39:30]  from someone  who's lost their mind  perhaps you've lost  your mind  maybe that's what  it feels like  maybe Charlie Manson  still thinks  he's doing jokes  I'm going to put  this swastika  in my head  people will think  I've lost my mind  you're going to think  I'm batshit crazy  he was kidding  back then  I said get me  a cup of coffee  once with the  Folgers lady  oh Christ  wow  hey  get this  I'm going to  carve a swastika  into my forehead 
[02:40:00]  with a spoon  that's going to  flip him out  isn't it  that'll get him  I'll do it right  before my parole  board meeting  and then I'll just  laugh at the end  Charlie  even the laugh  at the end  is not going to  play  yeah  no no  but I'll  show it  then I'll go  and then they'll  know I'm okay  he absolutely  had no clue  that he was crazy  he really didn't  he wants to stay  in jail man  he's smart  he wants to stay  yeah well 
[02:40:30]  I think there's  no doubt about it  that he wants to stay  he's probably got  nice in there now  at this point right  none of them  did any of them  gotten a squeaky  from gotten out  or a few of them  Tex Watson  any of those guys  I think  one of them got  in a pine box  Lynette  did Lynette get out  I would just like  to just go back  a moment and say  both of you said  he's probably got  a nice in there  yeah  I don't think so  no huh  why  I'm just saying  I don't think  it's nice  we don't think  it's that bad  in prison  it becomes your life  we had this whole  discussion  people are very 
[02:41:00]  adaptable  if you get cable  TV and you can  watch your shows  yeah I think  you just kind of  become like  well I'm in prison  it's not good  it sucks  but you don't  it doesn't suck  it's not like  looking from the  outside in  going like  holy fuck  I don't want  to be there  it's your in then  and then it becomes  alright well  it's lunch time  it's laundry time  every study  every study  they have ever  done  shows that people  in horrific  situations  it's not as bad  as people looking  at them from the  outside  people in good 
[02:41:30]  situations  it's not as good  right  you know there's  great interviews  with the Siamese  twins  attached at the  head  oh yeah  those two ladies  there  no not the  two headed  one  the one was  a country western  singer  not very good  by the way  attached at the  head  and their  life  by every way  shrinks can  measure it  is as good  as a regular  person's life  sure  just not that  bad  you get used  to having  your sister  attached to  your head  that was my  whole take  on prison 
[02:42:00]  and when they  say you know  well this guy's  got life without  parole and  it's great  and I just  go like  it's just  his life  now  see I  this is  you've learned  some crazy  things about me  over the years  I want to give  you a more  crazy thing  about me  I don't believe  that I believe  in punishment  I believe  just get people  away  make sure  they don't  do it again  but I have  no desire  to have them  suffer  you know  this whole  vindication  thing  the punishment  thing  it's just  not part 
[02:42:30]  of my heart  you know  like  Mark David  Chapman  you killed  John Lennon  now go away  I don't even  want to see you  again  we're just  done  but where  would they  then go  that's fine  prison is fine  but do it  as cheap  as you can  but you don't  need to make  it more  uncomfortable  I don't mind  if they have  to  I don't  want  I mean  just go away  almost a  Buddhist vibe  to that  just go away  Patrick Duffy  when his parents  got murdered  in the bar  said  he felt  for those  guys who  did it 
[02:43:00]  he said  imagine  having to  live the rest  of your life  knowing you  did that  that was his  Buddhist  thing  almost  I don't  think they  care  but just  get them  away  and that's  fine  that perfect  case is the  Connecticut case  with the  mother  and the  two daughters  that were  horribly killed  and raped  burned alive  obviously you can  look at it  and say  just go away  but as a  family member  as that father  now that you want  retribution for  but someone's  always going to  want retribution 
[02:43:30]  right but  the retribution  is never going  to help  anybody  really  not anybody  if you've  had something  horrible like  that happen  there's nothing  that's going  to help you  fucking up  someone else  isn't going  to make you  feel better  you're just  fucked  it's a  horrible  terrible  bad thing  is there a  deserving thing  like that  person deserves  to suffer  I don't  think so  I told you  I was in  that position  I actually  understand  your point  I don't  agree with  it but I  understand  where you're  coming from 
[02:44:00]  like Jimmy  said  it's sort  of a  almost a  Buddhist  thing  you get that  punishment  thing  it starts  building in  circles  I don't  think it  really  just go away  but we've all  decided that we'd  be okay in prison  should we knock  off a look at the store  yeah let's give it a whirl  I don't think you're okay  but I think people are  adaptable enough  where it's not  it just becomes  your life  like when you hear  the family members  that had a crime  committed against them  saying I just want to know  that he's suffering  in prison every day  and it's like he's not  I'm sure there are days 
[02:44:30]  where it's like wow  this sucks  I'm in prison  I can't do this  I can't do that  but there are days  he's probably laughing  his balls off  with another guy  down there  watching TV  or whatever  he's not suffering  all the time  you want him to suffer  because the victim's  family or whatever  you know I mean  they're suffering  constantly  of course  they're constantly  in pain  constantly  looking at pictures  of a loved one  of course  of course  there's nothing worse  it's terrible  and I'm not in any way  diminishing near pain  I'm just saying  I don't know  I don't know  how you get rid of it 
[02:45:00]  I don't know how you get  I don't know how  an eye for an eye  a tooth for a tooth  biblical retribution  doesn't seem to accomplish anything  I'm not sure  but I think you should do  like a month  of your show  from prison  I'm sure we would be horrified  but the only thing  that stops us  from misbehaving  we'd be like  ah this is not bad  it's jail  the thought of being incarcerated  is the only thing  that stops us  from fucking up  has kept me  a relatively good boy 
[02:45:30]  over the years  I'll tell you though  I think that the funk  would get to you  just the smell  just the smell  you know I read this book  there's this book  man groin smell  I think it's worse  than man groin smell  I think man groin smell  is what you'd be praying for  that would be inviting  praying for it  and God please  give me man groin smell  yeah I think  well I was  there's this book  called Packing for Mars  by Mary Roach  that talks about 
[02:46:00]  what it's like  to be an astronaut  which I didn't know  that being an astronaut  is breathing shit  and vomit  with every breath  that shit and vomit  floats through the air  and that psychologically  guys who are trained  professionally trained  to deal with each other  after six months  end up punching each other  in the face  in zero G  and they're talking  about sending people  to Mars  which is 500 days 
[02:46:30]  round trip  never opening a window  breathing your  and other people's  shit and vomit  and piss  constantly  they get  they get  E. coli  fecal infections  in their fucking  noses  kill yourself  just kill yourself  and their bones  deteriorate  they fall to pieces  and there are people  right now  in the United States  who are not crazy  there's no evidence  they're crazy 
[02:47:00]  who have said  they will take  a one way trip  to Mars  one way  deliver me to Mars  and I'll live there  and try to send me rockets  with air and food  and if you fail  okay I'll die there  whatever  I'll just  die on Mars  I'm reading this book  and all of a sudden  my house  which is over  10,000 square feet  is too claustrophobic  for me  because it's like  those first  you know  the Gemini guys  and stuff  and the Apollo guys  they were sitting 
[02:47:30]  in you know  a small Volkswagen  yeah the Mercury capsule  you guys alone  and pissing  into their own suit  for like  four or five days  and the helmet  on  just filling  with their own funk  and they  there's guys  that test  this is a job  for you  there are guys  there are guys  that get the job  testing  who aren't astronauts  but get the job  of lying in bed 
[02:48:00]  for a hundred days  without sitting up  to see their bones  deteriorate  and drinking  through straws  and all they do  is measure  their own shit  and what they eat  and everything else  and he doesn't even get  the glory  of being the guy  but they love  helping the space program  and there are people  that have been locked  in rooms  five person teams  in a smaller room  than this  for five hundred days  can I  imagine this  all these windows  just stop  and we are in here  for five hundred days 
[02:48:30]  let me  how soon  before we kill each other  let me jump in here  for a second  so you're saying  when they stepped  on the moon  for the first time  their space suits  were filled with shit  yes  didn't they have  any kind of way  to fucking  to clean that out  they don't have  they sort of have  things they can do now  but going back  to 1969  they have never  found  a zero G  toilet  that works  that glorious moment  they were filled  with shit 
[02:49:00]  it turns out  that when you are  evacuating your bowels  a big part  of what gets it  to vac  from your bowels  is gravity  and without gravity  it just kind of  hangs there  and they have to  scoop it out  of each other's asses  and then they have  to put it in a bag  and they have to  put pills in the bag  and then squeeze it up  squeeze it  so that the pills  go in there  otherwise  it will ferment  and blow up the bag 
[02:49:30]  and pop  and fill the air  that's all around you  with shit  this book  is the most  nightmare book  and I don't think  I was reading  this stuff going  I don't think  I could sit  in the capsule  for 15 minutes  and then we  none of this  is mentioned  then there's a rocket  on your ass  and they're blowing  you into space  where your chances  of dying  are as high  as anything  you've ever done  and they talk  about how the  astronauts  on the Apollo 
[02:50:00]  program  would not eat  or eat just cheese  so that they  wouldn't shit  for like 8 days  in space  why don't they  do something  like  you ever get  a colonic  if you've got  a solution  to this  it would be  really cool  my guess would be  why can't they  do something  like a colonic  with water  like if you've  gotten them  it does filter  you back  through the tube  where you're  using pressure  so why not  do that  every other  third day  yeah but it  does work  it's like  without any effort  you're lying  on your back  the water's  being pumped in 
[02:50:30]  it cleans you  out  and it pulls  the fecal matter  out with you  with the water  I would like  nothing more  in my life  than for that  sentence to win  you a Nobel Prize  I would love it  too  I would love  to see you  in Stockholm  in the tuxedo  going  James Norton  they all clap  here he is  I was just  talking on the radio  you know  it wasn't long ago  I was talking  on the radio  about  you know  and of course  let's go 
[02:51:00]  let's go to  our Nobel Laureate  Jim Norton  for the news  that was not  a bad idea  right  you put a little  fucking hose  you put a little  hole in the back  of the suit  call NASA  let's call them  right now  we got the solution  NASA on the blower  hole in the back  of your suit  I can't get past  the fact that  they had shit  in their space suits  when they're  stepping on the moon  that's why  they walk so awkwardly  jumping around  because their ass  is so fucking bad  even if you vomit  in your suit 
[02:51:30]  which you always do  it stops your visibility  and then you can't  get your hands  to your face  to wipe it out  of your nose  and it's floating  I've been in zero G  I went on the vomit comet  I went zero G  and I got this idea  I went with Billy Gibbons  which seems odd  from the ZZ Top  ZZ Top  so it was me  ZZ Top  and test pilots  it was an illegal flight  that we took  we went illegally  with a guy  who had an Air Mexico  747  and said he'd do 
[02:52:00]  the parabolas  747?  and what you do  to do zero G  is you do parabolas  just like that  that's up and down  almost like a heart monitor  it looks like  so we did it  over the ocean  and you know  the pilot's just trying  to go straight down  so I had decided  I was on with two astronauts  and some test pilots  and I had decided  you know the movie  Barbarella  sure  ah yes  I had decided  that what I wanted  what Billy Gibbons  wanted to do  was he wanted  to bring an amp  and a guitar  I saw this video  by the way  it's hilarious  and at zero G  he wanted to play 
[02:52:30]  the guitar  you should have  looked this up  that was his  that was his  dream  everyone had  something they wanted  my dream  my dream  was to do  the striptease  from Barbarella  in the beginning  of Barbarella  Jane Fonda  goes Barbarella  psychedella  kind of like  a conchashel  of love  and she's stripping  but she's on glass  she's on like  a Danny Thomas glass  and she's  I'll never live that down  she's moving  she's moving around  like that 
[02:53:00]  and she's not  really weightless  so I said  to the astronauts  I want to do a  I want to do a striptease  and I want to sing  Barbarella  and Billy Gibbons  well okay  I'll play a little guitar  and my hair was much  longer than  because I've cut it off  for locks of love  but it was much longer  than as long as  Jane Fonda's  in Barbarella  now the similarities  between me  and Jane Fonda  and Barbarella  may end  at hair length  yeah yeah  you've got it right here  you've got it right here  they've got me  floating around here  take a ride  in the NASA  what year is that  how long ago  I don't know  must have been  the 90s sometime 
[02:53:30]  there's me and Billy  and so I'm doing that  and when I start stripping  right  the astronauts  don't really understand  that when I say  I'm going to strip  I'm going to strip down  fully naked  so what you do  is you've got  35 seconds  of 0G  then you've got  35 seconds  of 2G  and 0G  is exhilarating  you weigh nothing  this 300 pound  fat fuck  weighs zero  it's terrific  but  at 2G's  I weigh 600 pounds 
[02:54:00]  you can't get something  for nothing  and it's just depressing  and horrible  and miserable  how sick did you get  down on the ground  that's where the story's going  they make you get on the floor  get on the floor  and then you can't even  lift your arms  really  so I'm doing Barbarella  Barbarella  and this astronaut  he's a fucking astronaut  which I figure  if you're an astronaut  and you've been breathing  other people's  piss shit  and vomit  you're not going to be  very squeamish  about things  but somehow  he's holding the video camera  somehow  he's a little surprised 
[02:54:30]  when I actually do  take my underwear off  throw it in the air  and little Houdini  is flapping in the breeze  weightless little Houdini  and I'm singing  you know Barbarella  I'm trying to do the Barbarella  and in my head  because I am a psychopath  in my head  I really do look  exactly like Jane Fonda  but the way the astronauts  are reacting  I don't think I do  your reaction  if Jane Fonda  in 1968  were floating  in front of you  weightless  turns out  is very different 
[02:55:00]  from your reaction  if Penn Jillette  you look more like  the tank she sat on  so I  do have to now  be totally naked  in two G's  laying on the floor  well that's where it goes  so I took off my belt  and I swung my belt around  because that's part of being  a sexy stripper  of course  and my dad  had just died  a year before  and had given me  a belt that he had  with a silver dollar in it  and when I swung  the belt around  it hit the fuselage  and the silver dollar  came out  and somehow 
[02:55:30]  somehow  I didn't understand  in my panic  in my zero G  that the fuselage  was closed  and we just find  the coin later  I'm not going to lose  the coin  that my father gave me  I love my dad  if the coin gets outside  you've got more problems  so I go running  naked  I go running naked  now  for the coin  and all the astronauts  are going  we're going to 2G  get down  get down  and I go  no no  I want to get this coin  they go  get down  find it later 
[02:56:00]  get down  I go  no no  I want to get  I can see  bam  and I hit the fuselage  at 2G  naked  flat on my  flat on my face  and I now weigh  600 pounds  and the coin  which weighs a pound  is in my hand  and I've got it  but I haven't been  sitting in the right position  so now  they go  35 seconds of that  oh no  oh no  with the astronauts  crawling to me  to make sure I'm okay  and then  okay we're going 0G 
[02:56:30]  so now I float in the air  now I'm disoriented  now I'm holding the coin  and now I am  vomiting  while I'm naked  and the astronaut  is holding me  and he goes  hey you're not singing  Barbarella now  are you  what a horrible scene  does everyone vomit  on that thing  hence the name  no  I was not going to vomit  until I was stupid  and went after that coin  from my dad  so when you get down  you're in the wrong position  to take the 2G's  oh  how does a pilot  fly that thing 
[02:57:00]  oh my god  you just  no I understand that  but how does he keep  he's strapped in  and control  if it goes to 2G's  when he can't really  move himself  oh yeah  well that's  that's the thing  there's astronauts  who have come in  and pulling 8G's  and 8G's  fingers up  your fingers are too heavy  just kill yourself  if you ever get  you know  if somehow they say  you guys are accepting  the space program  kill yourself  kill yourself  you're not going to enjoy it  you're not going to enjoy it  how long was the trip for 
[02:57:30]  that's pretty interesting  I did  well that's the thing  the first  8 parabolas  are the greatest thing  in the world  we did 30  oh wow  so actually  we were completely  weightless  for 15 minutes  damn  but we were also  2G's  for 15 minutes  they did that  in Apollo 13  the movie  they built a little set  inside one of the  set of the lunar module  and the command module  inside the fuselage  of one of these planes  and did that  so many times  to get all these shots 
[02:58:00]  so it didn't look like  the old fashioned  on a string  or you know  shit like that  it looked weightless  because they were weightless  and you know  the interesting thing  was Tom Hanks  did not strip naked  in Sing Barbara  no he didn't  but what would you  if you were going to be  weightless  what's the first thing  the first thing  you would think  Ron Howard did though  when he was filming it  you would think  I want to fuck  in Zero G  and I did think that  and there was an  attractive woman  like a test pilot  on there  with aftermarket breasts  and very very attractive  and I said to her  we're going to be 
[02:58:30]  in Zero G  I'm going to be  stripping naked  doing Barbarella  Billy's going to be  playing guitar  but do you want to fuck  sounds romantic  would that be fun  you've got to ask at least  and she says to me  well you know  I certainly like to  go out with you  after today  I said we're not  talking about after today  what the fuck  is wrong with you  I don't want to have  dinner with you  next week  I don't want to call you  this is a science experiment  this is two hamsters  in a cage  that's floating in the river  this is to see 
[02:59:00]  what it'll feel like  to fuck somebody  and your position  would be somebody  she goes  well you know  I just  I don't know  if I'm comfortable  I don't want you  to be comfortable  we're going to be  in Zero G  you're not going  to be comfortable  do you want  my penis in you  it doesn't matter  do you want  anybody here  as a matter of fact  pick somebody  anybody here  will fuck you  I'll watch  I'll be happy  you know  it's like a smooth talk  there's no time  for smooth talk  you're going to be  you're going to be  weightless  you only have  35 seconds 
[02:59:30]  to get it done  you have 35 seconds  would you get  hard like that though  could you get  your cock  hard in zero gravity  would that be weird  yes  I'd like to see  what it feels like  during the 2 G's  and how deep  you could get in  oh god  your cock  could be so heavy  your cock  weighs 4 pounds  it's a heavy cock  although I would think  the whole  but you haven't got  time to go  in 30 seconds  you're going to be  weightless  oh you got a little  something in your eye  yeah  I want to undo  your hair a little bit  oh my  without your glasses  you're beautiful  no time for that  let's fuck 
[03:00:00]  yeah let's fuck  quick  I think with every action  as an equal and opposite reaction  it would be kind of  a little rough  some people  some people believe  see I have fucked  40 feet below water  in scuba equipment  scuba equipment  I have done that  and it's very hard  to keep your neutral buoyancy  yeah  it's very hard  to be safe  and I also almost  froze her to death  because you know  I have much more body mass  and she was a skinny model  so there were some  parts of her body  that looked kind of blue 
[03:00:30]  but I've done that  so you know  I knew you could do  the pushing and stuff  and I also knew  Billy Gibbons would help  he's a rock and roll  how could you get a rod  under those circumstances  I could never do that  oh come on  you could too  no I couldn't  I'm very specific  very distracted  very distracted  yeah  well we could bring in  the horse porno  you could watch that  while you're  bring in the horse  good old Kenny Pinion  yes  naughty naughty  bowling engineer he was  what makes you scared man  because you do everything  does anything scare you  where you're like  get the fuck out of here  I'm not doing that  you know I don't tend to get 
[03:01:00]  I know you don't  I've learned that  over the years with you  I also thought of  that Mary Roach  who wrote the book  about Mars  packing for Mars  I wrote to her  fan letter  I write fan letters  like crazy  but they're not just  fan letters like  go on ONA  I like what you're doing  old school fan letters  old school  yeah I do that  and she had been zero G  and she does this  whole chapter  which is about  fucking in space  where she says  the desire to do it 
[03:01:30]  is so overwhelming  someone must have done it  but the danger  of being caught  and how reprimanded  you would be  nobody could have done it  so it's completely powerful  and she said  when she got on  her zero G flight  she said  to a guy there  let's just fuck  let's just do  she was doing the same thing  that I was doing  you two should have been  on the same flight  absolutely  if we were on the same flight  we could have negotiated  that deal  zero G fucking going on  by the second parabola  every astronaut 
[03:02:00]  would be breathing  piss  shit vomit  and my cum  and some cum  and vaginal secretions  sure  whatever else  comes out of there  it's the first thing  you think about  right  and I'll tell you  just so you know  if you and I  are ever in zero G  I'm fucking you  I'd jerk you off  at least  out of respect  of course you would  I mean if you're  talking about  the purpose of life  you know  in a godless universe  is to get good stories  and I don't think  you can beat  I jerked off  Jim Norton  in zero G  it's not gay  if you're in zero G 
[03:02:30]  there's no gravity  all bets are off  but I mean that would be  a great story  you're doing it for the story  yeah you jerk each other off  you laugh about it later  we're all in agreement  you know  and he's got  how many questions  have you got  what was it like  when you came  how did that feel  I would never be able to come  you know how awful  it would be to fucking collapse  and have his hand  still on my cock  in two G's  I can't get your hand  off my dick  I can't lift my hand  I can't lift my hand  then you look at each other  and go wow  this is really gay  my hand is stuck  and then  we start vomiting 
[03:03:00]  yeah  and then we land  and they have to  pry us apart  that just sounds like  a great date  what a great story  what a good date  you're right  that is good  but Jimmy  you guys  they're starting to do  it's no longer  illegal in sneaking around  they'll now do it  for like rich guys  do the problems  in zero G  I don't know if I have  the balls to do it  I would get very sick  I would like to think I do  well you get sick  sure  but it's worth it  you're zero G  you're fucking  you ever skydive  I haven't skydived  is that something 
[03:03:30]  you're scared of  skydiving  I'm not scared of it  no I just  skydiving  you know now  you do it on someone's back  you know they do that  to save you from  having to learn anything  you ever see the video  of the guy who jumps out  without a parachute  and then the guy  has to jump after him  with the parachute  he's like a stunt guy  and he jumps out  and he just fucking  takes a sip of an energy jink  and jumps out  of the fucking plane  and then his guy  jumps out after him  puts the parachute  on him as they're falling  some crazy shit  yeah they do  they do that  there's also something  I've heard about  but I haven't seen it  of a guy that jumps out 
[03:04:00]  with a camera  and forgets his parachute  and films the whole  oh shit  but that just  that description  is so  yeah  you got that too  how do you forget  can you turn a little more sim  oh is this the guy  yeah  look at that  oh yeah there  take some energy drink  there it goes  he's falling with no  his shorts and sunglasses on  this guy's rules  does he have an erection  because you know  there's a guy you jerk off  and he's free fall  this isn't like  just jump out  and give me the chute 
[03:04:30]  so now they grab him  to put the parachute on  imagine if his friends  really hate him  and they're like  ah fuck him  let's just let him go  screw you  how much time  do you think  they got to do this  oh so they're tandem  strapping him  yeah  I guess  they're not  I think they're raping him  it really does look like  they're  can you move that mouth  how much do you want  that parachute  because that's your time  to negotiate  imagine they go right up to him  they whisper in his ear  we never liked you  fuck you  and then don't do what  they were supposed to do  that's your time  that's your time  for negotiation 
[03:05:00]  holy shit  that ground's getting  a lot closer  I'm gonna give you  my parachute  there's a few things  I'd like to have  from you first  that sure is a pretty mouth  that's fucked up  I would be so fucking scared  the thought of jumping  out of a plane  without a parachute  that's trust right there  it's amazing  with a parachute  stinks  with a parachute  it would be scary  you ever watch the footage  of Captain  what's his name  Joe  the guy who jumps  from 102,000  oh from the  hot air balloon  the hot air balloon  listen to me  what is the fucking 
[03:05:30]  Wizard of Oz  his hot air balloon  his infernal device  hot air balloon  yeah Joe Kittinger  fucking jumped  that's the chilling footage  and he said he didn't feel  like he was falling  he said I thought  I wasn't falling  so I looked back  and saw the balloon  had gained distance  because it was  so low gravity  he's just got nothing  to base it on  and when you watch  the helmet cam he had on  it's like  you see the earth  and the space going by  it's great  yeah you know  when you  they told me  once you've been zero G  your brain knows  what it's like  to feel zero G 
[03:06:00]  and so when I was  flying home  like on a southwest flight  you know  it was great  because we hit a bump  we had turbulence  and we hit a bump  and I just  I was sleeping  and I just undid my seatbelt  and just pushed  you know  you just  it's so great  and I'm so  fucking stupid big  I mean  I'm gigantic  I've been gigantic  since I was six years old  you know  so the idea  of weighing nothing  I mean  me weighing nothing  is a bigger deal 
[03:06:30]  than you guys  weighing nothing  it was just terrific  when did you hit six foot  early  you know  when the girls  hit six foot  I was bigger  than my fifth grade teacher  wow  you know  it's just  and you know  people that teach  elementary school  are counting on  all their charges  being smaller  you were almost  one of those giants  yeah  oh yeah  you know  the Jewish giant  at home in Brooklyn  you know  I was a Diana Arbus  movie happening  you know  my whole life  was that  and it was just  and the other thing is  my son  you know  my son is four  and he's the size 
[03:07:00]  of a Buick  and he's huge  and you see him  go through this thing  because he's very articulate  he speaks very well  and he's giant  so people think  he's in like second grade  and yet emotionally  he's a little four year old boy  so you also get treated  and I also remember  and no one talks about  the problems  with enormous kids  in school  but when I was in junior high  you know  and I was bigger  than any of you  my best friend 
[03:07:30]  was like five feet tall  you know  and we would be playing  and strangers  would come over  absolute strangers  would come over to me  and say  hey hey  what are you doing here  with these little kids  get out of here  get out of here  and I would go  what what  I had no idea  and I get to be like 22  and I went  wait a minute  they thought I was  trying to fuck those kids  they thought you were a pedo  but you know  you have no idea of that  did you have like  facial hair and stuff  no I wasn't  I wasn't that kind  weren't able to have a beard  it was strictly size 
[03:08:00]  I looked very  because a friend of mine  was able to grow  a full beard  in the first year  of high school  full big beard  and he was  we don't have one of those guys  he was constantly  getting thrown out  they were just like  hey get out of here  he's like Ty  go here  did they recruit you  for basketball  oh they tried to do  all that crap  but I'm not  I think you weren't  an athlete right  I'm not a sports guy  at all  they must have been  so frustrated  you know what we could have  if you could just  throw that stupid ball  and I was also a juggler  so I was unicycling 
[03:08:30]  juggling  doing all this hand-eye stuff  but the team sports stuff  I just didn't like  and they  the coaches must have  cried themselves  asleep every night  I went out for one  basketball thing  you know  and I  I went out  and I  you know  I was okay  you know  I played a little bit  and I missed a shot  and the coach  kind of  cuffed me  in the side of the head  hey what are you doing  Gillette  just  forgive me  I just touched  your shoulder  but just kind of  cuffed me  and the way 
[03:09:00]  I was brought up  I said  you just hit me  he said  well no  you should have  made that shot  I said  you just  fucking hit me  he said  don't use that  language here  and I said  it's after school  this is not  I'm not in your class  fuck you  I'm leaving  and he said  you don't leave  you go out there  and prove to us  what you can be  on the basketball court  I said  I'll prove to you  that what I can be  is off the basketball court  and fuck you  and he said  that language  will not be tolerated  I said  we don't have any problem  because you go 
[03:09:30]  fuck yourself  I get out of here  everybody's happy  and that was my  one day of basketball  and he was my  math teacher  algebra teacher  I got 100%  on every test  the rest of the year  and got a D  he had no qualms  at all  about punishing me  for not playing basketball  and then football season  would come along  and they'd say  you know  if you'd cut your hair  so you didn't look  like a homo  we'd have you  on the football team 
[03:10:00]  and I said  well that's good  so did you  I'm not going to cut my hair  and I'm not going to go  on your football team  but I will be a homo  that's a much better  sounding thing  let me get this straight  homo  we get to listen to records  and get blowjobs  and out there  I get to have other sweaty guys  bump into me  and knock me down  I'll go  I'll take the kimono  and the Judy Garland records  please  that's an easy choice  for me  oh shit  homo  that's the funniest thing  to call someone to 
[03:10:30]  yeah  you homo  well this is you know  it's the 70s  yeah yeah  it's the 70s  you can't do that now  you wouldn't say gay  not allowed to say  all that stuff now  people get very offended  I was quoting someone  saying it to me  yeah of course  yeah of course  no no it's not what I  we don't understand  why people are offended  by dumb words  I called him a motherfucker  there you go  in fact  also  anything you've got to  cut your hair to do  isn't that good  no  I mean I did the  locks of love thing  but you know  that's something  yeah  that scared me to death 
[03:11:00]  you know I've had hair  down my back forever  yeah  and there we were  cutting off my ponytail  and I'm thinking  I mean  she's probably gonna die  anyway  so I really have to  cut off my hair  for the one  but you know  it was too late then  yeah  it's very hard  during your press release  to go  yes we're here  because you know  this would be made  for wigs  for cancer patients  yeah  Jesus it feels nice  to my back  fuck her  good luck everybody  they don't have to  throw the wig  in the casket  if you want to be brutal  she can always  leave it to somebody else  yeah  oh my god 
[03:11:30]  so now I look like  a marine  I look like a marine  oh yeah  you're so short  I wonder if anybody  knows it's  hey this by the way  is Penn Jillette's hair  I think you know  I think there's not  a child who wouldn't  run screaming  first cancer  then chemo  now Penn Jillette's hair  Penn Jillette's hair  I heard he's a homo  damn it  what is it  did you guys play sports  you all played sports  nah I didn't play any sports  I played basketball  but I didn't have your height  yeah  that's why it kills me  I was a pitcher 
[03:12:00]  when I played baseball  I did nothing  but smoke pot  in high school  that was it  I smoked pot  I regret it  I regretted it  until I got this cool gig  but uh  I regretted not doing  better in school  it was amazing  my grades were  I had great grades  I started smoking pot  very late in life  um  and I had really  great grades  well late in life  isn't high school  is it  uh  well for smoking weed  a lot of people  start in like  junior high  you know  they always had  the stoners in  junior high  but I was like  great in junior high  even into high school  but then like  my last two years 
[03:12:30]  of high school  I started smoking pot  and  what you could  graph this  and just watch  like  wow  fell off the face  of the earth  I didn't want to do  anything  didn't want to go to class  didn't understand  how my friends  were graduating  because they were  cutting class too  but they would cut  one class  and I'd see them  but then I'd see  the other guy  from the other class  and I didn't understand  they were going  to their other classes  I was the one  that saw everyone  because I wasn't  going to any class  and would you  have been texting too  uh  I would have been  if I could have  had a cell phone 
[03:13:00]  back then  but uh  no cell phones  I'd have to pass notes  text  pass notes  pass notes  or you'd get  into desk wars  which was like  texting or emailing  where you'd be  whoever sits here  at third period  sucks  fuck you  I'll find out  who this is  you'll fuck  your mother  you piece of shit  and then someone  will watch the desk  and you're like  oh fuck  we have to start off  with this guy  it was great  desk wars  I hadn't made  I hadn't made 
[03:13:30]  my point yet  yeah I hadn't really  gotten my point across  on this desk yet  I was just laying  the foundation  the Socratic desk method  yeah exactly  and if you were a man  and Plato was a man  and you fuck your mother  and now  by a simple syllogism  you suck ass  they'd watch the desk  come back the next day  homo  he made his point too  oh just so  to remind everybody 
[03:14:00]  the plug's important  Penn is here  yes  and he's here to promote  the fact that I'm going  to be in Poughkeepsie  the 19th and 20th  that's the only reason  he came in  Bananas Comedy Club  that's the only reason  he came in  obviously  Play Dead is something  Teller's doing  it's at the Players Theater  and here's the  I'm going to give you  the number and the website  it's 800-982-2787  and you can just go online  Play Dead NYC  P-L-A-Y-D-E-A-T  P-L-A-D-N-Y-C dot com  and if you're in Vegas  it's a great show  and it's in a little theater  and it's down to the place 
[03:14:30]  it's already in preview  you can go tonight  and then it opens  tomorrow night  that's when I'll be there  because I go to the  big important opening  I'm going to Collins  opening tonight actually  oh yeah  I was going to go to that  then I decided to go to  I wanted to go  and I'm going to  Merchant of Venice  with Al Pacino  I'd like to see that  across the street  hey you haven't seen  Collins show  no it's great  it's really good  I saw it in the smaller  it's really smart  I think you would like it  a lot  yeah I want to see it  I saw it in the Tiny Theater  now they've got a lot  of production behind it  I bumped into Al Pacino 
[03:15:00]  at a restaurant  and I said you know  I really want to get  to see your show  and it's sold out  all the time  and I'm trying to go  through a friend of mine  to get one ticket  and he said  did he chip a tooth  on your kneecap  we are different sizes  yes yes  so you picked him up  and held him like a child  and talked to him  what I did was I said  you know in zero G  I'd fuck you  and you would have a choice  and he said  tell them that Al  Al wants you to have a seat  and I said  I could call up the producer  and say  Al Pacino wants me 
[03:15:30]  to have a seat  and it'll work  he said yes  I said why wouldn't  everybody do that  he said I don't know  that many people  I said but they're going  to take my word  so I called the producer  and I said  I bumped into Al Pacino  at a restaurant  he'd like me  to have a ticket  okay we'll get you one  wow  this was completely  sold out  done  couldn't do it  so I shouldn't say  this on the radio  exactly  because everyone's  going to try it  do you know Al though  I had never met him  and I met him  at the restaurant  we had a wonderful talk  wow that's great  fuck  I would love to do that  that's a big fun  what would you say  that's real fame 
[03:16:00]  right there  hey I loved you  in the godfather  Penn is interesting  there you go  what would you  possibly say  I would just tell him  how much I loved him  in the deer hunter  and I would  bang the drum slowly  you were amazing  I would do nothing  but fuck him up  with De Niro  and where did your mole go  exactly  do you really like  black chicks  they're not my thing  Al  you just  yeah  tremendous  I don't know 
[03:16:30]  I don't know  you're going by yourself  that's fucking good  I am going by myself  I will sit there  for three hours  enjoying Shakespeare's  depiction of our  Jewish brothers and sisters  yes  in your  Al Pacino  complimentary seat  Al says  you want me to have a seat  I have a seat  there's going to be  50 people there  going wait a minute  Al said I could sit here  yeah Al just says that  the way Opie tells people  no come on the show  we'd love to have you  and then they call  and he's like  what are you talking about  shh  shh  that's exactly 
[03:17:00]  what I expected  but it did work  that's the genius  it worked  it worked  you haven't seen it yet  so go to  let us know  I just want to tell  everybody listening  when you go to Las Vegas  just call the box office  at the Penn and Teller  here at the Rio  and say Penn wants me  to have a seat  that's it  he wants me to have a seat  at some other show  but  I'm doing Vegas in February  I actually want to go out  a day early and see you guys  I've never seen your show  I want to see the Vegas show  very much  I've never been to a Penn and Teller show 
[03:17:30]  no I haven't either  but I want to go  I don't even remember  the name of the place  it's just a one night thing  it's a small place  but I'm going to go out  a day early and see their show  I saw you guys up in Boston  years ago  we do a lot of  we've done  six hours  of new material  since we've been in Vegas  can I ask you something  does it get boring  to do the same show  no we don't do the same show  first of all  we change it whenever we want  no for you guys  I mean obviously  the crowd will always  oh no no  we change it even  what do you guys do  to each other  just to make it  we don't do any of that stuff  we're just trying to do it  better every night 
[03:18:00]  a friend of mine  Michael Godot  head writer on Bullshit  said he's a juggler  worked on the Lance Burton show  and he said  variety arts  juggling and magic  are for people  who see Groundhog Day  and think  that seems like a good thing  I like that  it really is great  to be able to go out  and do the same thing  and get better at it  okay  because we had a friend  on Broadway  to sing every day  we had a friend  on Broadway  and he was begging us  to just fucking  kidnap him  he couldn't take it anymore  well that's also  you're doing someone else's  he couldn't fucking 
[03:18:30]  take it  but that wasn't something  he wrote himself  no  and then I said  well  at least you mixed it up  a little bit  and wow  how you fell into that  you know  that dumpster  you made that up  obviously  just to make it interesting  he goes  no I do that exact  fucking move  every fucking night  even the stuff  you think we're improvising  is not improvised  yeah well that's  that's pretty much true  he went nuts  but it's stuff that we write  and then we also write  new stuff all the time  we put in a new bit  every couple of months  yeah good for you  so we're working on it  all the time  and there's no reason to  you know other shows  oh you've been able to  just for years 
[03:19:00]  do the same thing  and you know  we tell people  we write new stuff  and put it in  they go why  and we go because  when we were 12 years old  all we wanted to do in life  was write stuff  and do it on stage  oh yeah I know  but now you get success  you don't have to do that  it's all we ever wanted to do  we worked our asses off  to get to where you're at  I don't know  how do you write magic  oh come on thanks Ant  I understand  you gotta write  like the production around it 
[03:19:30]  but like to come up  with a trick  or a gag  you get this idea  for something you wanna do  you know we wanna  yeah but then you gotta  figure out how the fuck  to do it  and not let other people  onto it  and it takes you know  we did this thing  where we saw a woman in half  we saw her in half  we show how it's done  and then we fuck up  and saw in half again  and it gets really bloody  and everything  so we have to do  we have to do  a complete sawing in half  and then do it  a completely different  so we have to have it  a complete trick  and then have another trick  on top of it  it took us  two and a half years 
[03:20:00]  wow  $80,000  Jesus  of R&D  working on it  and it is  two and a half minutes  of our show  two and a half minutes  and the guys we work with  go uh  anybody else  with that much work  can put in  it's the hardest thing  we've done  we're hitting the levers  and switches  and the timing  and we had to rebuild it  five times  and it didn't work  and all this shit  and you know  it's two and a half minutes  on stage  it takes the crew  an hour and a half  to set it  for it to work once  everything has to be perfect 
[03:20:30]  and we do this whole thing  and everybody that works  with us goes  shouldn't you be getting  a half hour out of this  and we go  it's so boss  at two and a half minutes  it's like holy fuck  they'll do anything  and then after the show  people come and go  you know that trick  was amazing  but you didn't build it up enough  we didn't know  I go you knew it was good  that's all  that's all we need  that's fine  because we're now  at the point  where we have so much material  we keep shortening shit up  so stuff we work on  for a couple years  can be two minutes  and we're thrilled with it  we just give them  the prestige 
[03:21:00]  that's all we give  how long was your show  what 90 minutes  yeah we do 90 minutes  and I play  I play jazz  for an hour beforehand  I play upright  bass bebop  so come in  when you come to the show  come an hour early  and hear some great jazz  and then we do our show  and we also meet everybody afterwards  do you still get stumped by magicians  do you see them and go like  well it's interesting  I know how everything works  fuck you  we're doing a show  that's not announced yet  but we're doing a show  over in England  called Fool Us  which will be just magicians 
[03:21:30]  coming on  oh wow  what a great idea  holy fuck  that's great  if they fool us  they get a trip to Vegas  and get to do a show  and if they don't fool us  we bust them right there  so that's a double lift  and you force the card  and they're right now  and it's weird  because we created the show  it's our idea  but because of all the laws  and stuff  we can't know anything about it  so there's 40 people  working on this show  including friends of mine  and I get an email  from friends of mine  that said  hey I get hired on your show  I've been told 
[03:22:00]  I can't talk to you  write you emails  or any contact with you  for two and a half months  bye  because you know  they're finding the guys  they're rehearsing it  they wanted to be all  on the up and up  and so we're just  going to sit there  and  it's not really  Fool Us  it's really Fool Teller  and Penn talks about it  because Teller  knows everything  and when you see  Play Dead  it's the best magic  you'll ever see  in this plotted  show about  about 
[03:22:30]  you know  death  and the afterlife  and so on  but the tricks are amazing  because Teller is  one of the top five  magic minds alive today  no doubt about it  and when I go to a show  with Teller  the magic show  you know  the real truth of it is  is I sit there  very smug  very cool  I'm a professional magician  I'm magician of the year  five years  I'm one of the best  in the world  and I sit there  and go to Teller  what are they doing  and Teller goes  it's a 45 degree angle  mirror under the table  he can actually 
[03:23:00]  figure that shit out  really  really  yes  yes  oh shit  and then people  after the show  go you know  that's done  I go yeah  sure  yeah yeah  got mad  we've got it set up  so I sit there  we watch it  and then Teller  and I go into  soundproof booth  and we confer  for a minute  and then I come out  and explain  he told you  what the fuck  just happened  he's gonna tell me  every one of them  you know  unless the guy's  doing the hippity hop  rabbits  I'll be totally  in the fucking dark  so my acting job 
[03:23:30]  is to pretend  while I'm watching  that I'm figuring  something out  instead of just  waiting for Teller  to tell me  you know  because if I was  really doing it  I'd be just  looking over  Teller going  do we have it  do we know  do we know  are we gonna get  fucked in this one  or do you know  look and put your  hand on your chin  and just go  yeah  oh it's that  oh it's that  when he does  something you just  go oh come on  come on  yeah  that's my part  and then Teller  what are you doing  what a great idea  for a show  I love it 
[03:24:00]  Teller is great  because you know  we'll go to see  you know  go to see Copperfield  and I'll go  boom  what's he doing  what's he doing  is he still hard  to figure out  for you though  it's a false bottom  I go really  Copperfield got lazy  I saw him in Vegas  he still can do  some good tricks  you can say what you want  I was not impressed  really  I didn't like  how's Lance Burton  Lance Burton is closed  oh  Lance Burton is done  Lance Burton retired  was he good  he just quit 
[03:24:30]  who's the guy to see  right now  besides you guys  well the guy to see  in Vegas  and no one believes me  because it's an afternoon show  is Mac King  Mac King  does an afternoon show  at Harrah's  for like you know  eight bucks  it's like you know  a drink minimum  it's nothing  and to me  he is the best  comedy magician  working in the world  and he is  you know  comedy magicians  and you've seen a lot of them  because you work on bills with them  they're usually  comedy magicians means  none of the magic fools you 
[03:25:00]  and they're not funny  they don't do either  and Mac King  is sincerely funny  and the tricks  will fool the shit out of you  and he's got a show  like at one in the afternoon  and three in the afternoon  so people say to me  you know  what show should I see  and I go  go in the afternoon  to Harrah's  and see Mac King  and they go  you're kidding  and they always come back  and go  holy fuck  he's really good  Chips Cooney  is probably the greatest  comic magician  do you know Chips Cooney  how do I not know him  he was on America's Got Talent  very gifted  very gifted magician  he's pretty funny man  he's been around a long time  and then he got on 
[03:25:30]  America's Got Talent  this past season  I've never seen Chips  I've never seen Chips live  it's good  there's some good people  oh  what  what  Ovi and Anthony  Ovi and Anthony  are the virus  Sirius XM  you </pre>
