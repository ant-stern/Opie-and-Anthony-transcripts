<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show, featuring Jim Norton, began with self-deprecating humor about their "mean-spirited" nature before diving into the Don Imus controversy.  They played Imus's comments about the Rutgers women's basketball team ("nappy-headed hoes"), his apology, and analyzed the ensuing outrage.  They argued the comments, while offensive, weren't maliciously intended and criticized the disproportionate reaction compared to other issues like black-on-black crime and Sharpton's actions. A satirical song about Sharpton was played.  A Black female caller, Amanda, agreed with some criticisms of Sharpton but disagreed with their dismissal of Imus's comments.  The segment heavily featured racial slurs and offensive jokes, some self-directed.  The discussion continued throughout the show, focusing on double standards in media and the context of racial discourse.

The show then shifted to a humorous, absurd segment about Opie's alleged father, followed by discussions of Baghdad's capture anniversary, Zach Johnson's Masters win (leading to "Masters and Johnson" jokes), and the poor box office performance of *Are We Done Yet?* compared to *Grindhouse*.  Tom Chiusano's off-air argument was mentioned.  A caller, Michael from Brooklyn, criticized *Grindhouse*, sparking a heated debate about Tarantino's portrayal of women and gender roles in media, with Michael expressing resentment towards American women.  The hosts attempted to understand his perspective before ending the call.  A news story about a man self-mutilating after a divorce followed, prompting darkly humorous speculation.  Jim Norton requested a fat woman for a book cover photoshoot.

A large portion of the broadcast focused on a critical review of *The Sopranos*' season premiere, with the hosts and callers expressing disappointment with its slow pace and lack of action.  Janice Soprano's appearance was heavily criticized, and they speculated about the show's ending.  Howard Stern's alleged mockery of their Vegas ratings was discussed, leading to a retort and counter-accusations. Further *Sopranos* discussion, including Frank Vincent's role, ensued.  A caller noted four writers were credited for the episode.  A segment of Bill O'Reilly's show featuring a heated exchange with Geraldo Rivera about an illegal immigrant's drunk driving accident was played.  The hosts described "Yabocam" and a video featuring Eden.  Frank Vincent called in, discussing his role in *The Sopranos* and his new book.

The Don Imus controversy continued, with further analysis of his apologies, justifications, charity work, and claims about racial perspectives.  The hosts made crude comments about a photo of the Rutgers basketball team.  Frank Vincent called in again.  Comedian Patrice O'Neal also called, offering his perspective using offensive language and humor.  An upcoming "Art of the Topless" band performance and plans for "Exploitation Fridays" were briefly mentioned. The segment was filled with highly offensive language and sexually explicit and racially charged humor.


A listener, Jeff from Philly, criticized their radio practices, leading to a discussion about listener habits and the show's reach.  They replayed a previous bit, "Slave Girl," featuring Francine and Danny, including audio clips.  Callers confirmed whether or not they had heard the bit.  A humorous discussion about a midget sighting at Dunkin' Donuts occurred.  Eric, a guest, offered a corporate perspective on the Imus controversy.  Jim Norton's displeasure with his Mets tickets was discussed.  The show ended with further discussion of "Slave Girl" and its potential reenactment by listeners. Jim Norton, Patrice, and Eric were in studio.

The broadcast continued with a discussion of the firings of Jimmy "The Greek" Snyder and Imus, contrasting their use of offensive language.  The hosts used highly offensive language, repeatedly calling Al Sharpton a "cunt."  They interacted with a studio audience, including a man watching from across the street, a family whose children's fight video went viral, a Pepsi employee, a physical therapist, and a family with two mothers and their teenage sons. The hosts engaged in insensitive jokes with the family. A local news reporter, who had written articles about the show, was also present, and the conversation shifted to Louis C.K.'s tour dates.  A debate about the ethics of a national DNA database ensued, weighing government misuse against its benefits in crime solving.  The show concluded with further banter, including discussions of celebrities and the "line of the day" segment, interspersed with crude jokes and sexual innuendo.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  What is this?  Garbage!  You know what? I can't take this anymore.  It's an awful, awful radio show.  We're really, really mean-spirited, evil people who can't see the good in anything.  I think we've done a good job so far of being open-minded and broad-minded.  You know, like when you try to call the police when I touch you.  I don't call the police.  I just pretend because it makes you touch me a little harder. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, God.  Excellence in broadcasting.  It's too bad you've got to have some form of intelligence to listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's be honest, you probably didn't graduate high school.  You probably have three or four kids, and you're probably a grandma at the age of 32.  So I guess we have to give that much to you.  Tony, I'd like to apologize.  I would never apologize.  Go away.  Jail is better than this misery I'm in. 
[00:01:00]  Anthony.  I just think Nazi, and I can't get it out of my head.  Jim Norton.  Hilarious!  Hilarious people!  You guys ready to laugh?  It's got to be the greatest thing ever.  I'd sooner have a water drinking contest.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Thud, thud, thud. 
[00:01:30]  Take your coat off.  We're ready to broadcast, sir.  Yeah, I was a little chilly.  Fine now, though.  Voice warm-up time.  Jimmy, warm up your voice. 
[00:02:00]  Anthony?  Frankus.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's a virus.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  We say good morning to Buffalo, New York.  Hi, Buffalo.  And we don't say good morning to Buffalo, New York  because their Sabres are playing my Islanders in the playoffs. 
[00:02:30]  Stupid Islanders back in their way into the playoffs yesterday.  Shouldn't even have been there.  On Easter Sunday.  It was an Easter miracle, Opie, for the Islanders.  I thought they were like a bunch of goals out.  I didn't follow hockey, but I know that they were not in good shape.  You know what, Jimmy?  That's exactly what was going on.  The Islanders were pretty much out of it.  Like five or six things had to happen.  The Islanders had to win all their games.  And then this team had to win or lose or tie to this team.  It was like a weird mathematical thing. 
[00:03:00]  And everything that was supposed to happen for the Islanders  to get in the playoffs did.  So they can lose in the first round.  So Anthony's right.  It was an Easter Day miracle.  Easter miracle.  I'm getting texts, messages, and emails from Tom Chiasano.  Good luck today.  Like I have something to do with the Islanders getting into the playoffs.  Good luck today.  People feel if you're a fan of a team that you deserve congratulations  when the team gets in to the playoffs, wins a playoff, wins it all. 
[00:03:30]  That you, hey, hey, congrats, congrats.  Thank you.  Me and the team worked very hard this year.  Yeah, yeah.  What did you do?  I watched TV.  Well.  I went, yay, go, team, go.  What did you do?  I sit on the couch and I have one of those like foam things with the finger  and I point at the number one.  Yeah.  My team is number one.  Right.  Hooray.  And then the Islanders blow it.  They give up a goal to the Devils with less than a second left.  Yeah, like microseconds left. 
[00:04:00]  I think four-tenths of a second was left when the Devils score.  It's like, of course, of course this is how it has to happen.  Yeah.  And then in the shootout, the Islanders, you know, beat the Devils  and they're in the playoffs.  So, and then, yeah, my phone goes crazy with all the congratulatory Texas.  Mm-hmm.  Texas.  Texas.  Texas.  Texas.  Texas.  Texas.  Congratulating me because they're in the playoffs.  I'm like, I had nothing to do with it.  I'm just a fan watching on Easter Sunday.  I just like to watch.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  So, there you go.  But that's not why we say good morning to Buffalo.  No.  We're kicking ass in Buffalo.  We add them to the list of cities this month as well as last month.  Buffalo's been on a roll month after month after month.  Buffalo loving the Opie and Anthony show.  Thank you.  The edge up there in Buffalo just blowing up in the ratings.  Just blowing up.  So, good morning to Buffalo this morning.  Thank you, Buffalo.  And good morning to Mr. Ives. 
[00:05:00]  Our pal's in a little trouble.  Yeah.  He's in a little bit of trouble.  It's been in the news all weekend.  Yeah, you know what?  This all went down last week.  And, you know, we try to be on top of everything that's going on around us, especially in the radio world and blah, blah, blah.  And I honestly didn't think it was that big of a deal.  But they're trying to get Mr. Imus fired.  It's everywhere.  There's a clip of him on the news.  And we work for the same company as Mr. Imus.  And I say to the company, hang in there.  Yeah. 
[00:05:30]  Everyone is watching and listening to Imus this morning.  And there's Imus on the other one.  Look, it's a big story.  Hang in there.  It's a big story.  Leave the I-Man alone.  For once, a company has to hang in there.  For the love of God, the guy has turned himself pretty much into a political talker.  The guy talks to all the top politicians in this country.  And he tries to harken back his old shock jock days for a second. 
[00:06:00]  And look at what happens.  He gets himself in trouble.  Who would think the Opie and Anthony show would be sitting here trying to defend Mr. Imus for being a shock jock?  Shame on you, Don Imus.  Shame on you, sir.  Shame on you.  And you're shock jockery.  Clean up your act.  What are you doing?  You're offensive, Mr. Imus.  And I am outraged.  We should organize a protest. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  That'd be hysterical.  Watching nappy-headed girls with signs.  Yes.  I think we should organize a counter-protest.  Because they're marching on a stupid...  Who's marching?  They're going to march to...  They're going to set up a picket line at MSNBC on Friday, supposedly.  Good luck.  Here's the thing.  Nothing's going to come of this.  Let me play the story just to get everyone up to speed around America.  I'm sure just about everyone knows, but just in case.  Well, they're going to picket.  You're sure they don't have somewhere else to be from 9 to 5? 
[00:07:00]  Oh, probably not.  Oh, they're going to come after us next.  Hey, um...  Um, uh...  Uh, sorry.  No, I'm not.  Nah, you know.  Come on.  Here's the story.  The pastor of the New Jersey chair cracks about the team.  He called them nappy-headed hoes.  Reverend DeForest...  You know what?  I love when they have to say what they said.  That's just funny.  Funny's funny.  Nappy-headed hoes?  You know what?  And that gets them in all kinds of trouble? 
[00:07:30]  Stop it.  It's just...  First of all, uh, uh, nappy-headed hoes, that's used all the time in the black community.  And don't say, uh, chose the N-word, but you can't use that.  How many words are you going to take away as being offensive when it's used, it's rampantly used in your own community?  Police your own community.  There are things that are happening in the black community that should outrage you.  Black-on-black crime is rampant. 
[00:08:00]  Rampant.  You watch the news, it's like...  And that's the thing where Patrice was getting into that Friday.  You know, he goes, why are white people so scared?  He goes, we're killing each other.  Which is true.  You watch it on the news, and you know, you get the occasional old lady getting the old right hook in her walker as she's coming out the stairs, down the stairs.  And that's one thing.  But the truth of the matter is, black-on-black crime is just running rampant.  You use stories in East New York here, and other places that are just known for high crime. 
[00:08:30]  And it's a black guy coming up to another black guy, and popping him in the head, and that guy gets killed.  And there's no outrage.  There's no one saying, why is this happening?  Let's fix this.  They're too busy protesting when Don Imus says nappy-headed hoes.  That's the big issue in the black community, where all the leaders have to come out.  And I use the term loosely, leaders.  Have to come out and voice their opinions on how outrageous this is and call for firings. 
[00:09:00]  How about we call for the firings of the black leadership that is doing nothing, nothing,  when it comes to the black community killing each other, and robbing each other, and raping each other?  Where's that outrage?  You bunch of hypocrites.  There's Reverend Al Sharpton.  Al Sharpton is one of the biggest lying sacks of crap out there, and should be thrown out of the black community.  The guy should be run out on a rail of the black community and just left somewhere and say, 
[00:09:30]  you're no longer allowed to represent us.  You've proven yourself back in the Tawana Brawley days of being a race-baiting, hating, white-hating, race-baiting liar.  Him with Maddox and Mason, those two, remember them?  How come they got to disappear off the face of the earth because they tripped over their own schlongs when it came to the Tawana Brawley case? 
[00:10:00]  And Reverend Al is looked at as a leader?  That guy's not a leader.  He's a race-baiter.  Do something real for your community.  Do something worthwhile.  I'm saying nappy-headed hoe is not hurting the black community.  Sorry, it's not.  In the big picture, there's plenty of other things.  There's probably 8,642 more important things than nappy-headed hoe.  You didn't hear one word of outrage from black people when that little old lady got that pillbox hat punched off her head. 
[00:10:30]  Exactly.  You didn't see.  All right, it was funny to watch.  But you didn't hear, like, one word from the irrelevant NAACP or from Sharpton.  Nothing.  Why didn't they come out and say, why is this happening?  Why is this gentleman of color punching an elderly white woman and robbing her?  We need to get the answer to this.  Is it Imus saying nappy-headed hoe? 
[00:11:00]  Is that what caused this?  I don't think so.  All right, let's get the news story just to get everyone up to speed.  He punched her a bunch of times, by the way, that old lady.  She had a corner man.  A cut man.  Cut me, Gertrude.  The Jersey church, attended by most of the Rutgers women's basketball team, has vowed to take on Don Imus for his on-air cracks about the team.  He called them nappy-headed hoes.  Reverend DeForest Soares Jr. says that he'll pick at CBS in Manhattan, which owns Imus' station, WFAN, until he is fired. 
[00:11:30]  The Reverend Al Sharpton says he will join the protest.  Imus is scheduled to appear on Sharpton's radio show today, but Sharpton says that will not change his position.  Oh, my God.  Why are they calling for his firing?  He did apologize, which, by the way, I don't think he should have.  And I'm speculating.  I don't know anything.  We work for the same company, but I don't know anything.  I just think there was probably a lot of pressure from corporate. 
[00:12:00]  And the only reason I'm saying this is because we've been through this.  We know how it is when the corporate gets scared, when a couple of people get together with the likes of Reverend Al, when he gets together and fires off a letter that he's going to protest, corporate runs scared.  They run scared and make people apologize, which is crap.  Or they were threatening to go after his guests, and they would start, like, whatever guests he had on.  You know something?  Yeah, but it ain't going to happen. 
[00:12:30]  If someone would sit out a protest or a boycott and just sit it out and watch what happens, you'd realize nothing happens.  That's why we tell the company to hang in there today.  By the way, speaking of protests.  These days.  Yeah.  Yeah, some of it works.  I was going to say, these days.  Speaking of protests, you've got Jesse Jackson getting involved as well.  Yeah.  And I found this very interesting.  Jesse Christfowl on Imus.  And then it says, plans protest at NBC offices.  Yeah.  In Chicago. 
[00:13:00]  What happened in Chicago?  Oh, because he's...  How about flying to New York?  How about you fly to New York where he broadcasts?  He doesn't even deem this that important.  So he's planning a protest at the NBC offices in Chicago.  Imus basically has nothing to do with the offices in Chicago.  He broadcasts his show out of New Jersey right across the river, actually.  You know, the guy puts on a very informative, intelligent show mixed in with some irreverent 
[00:13:30]  and cutting-edge humor.  That's what Imus' show is.  All the guys on there are very talented, very funny.  I mean, who can argue that Imus has had a very long and great career in radio?  How the hell do you take one statement that he made, whether you find it offensive or not,  whatever the context is, whether it was done in comedy, I absolutely doubt a guy as charitable  as Imus is going to do something to be nasty or mean-spirited like that. 
[00:14:00]  It's a joke.  It comes out.  You're flying off the cuff when you're on the radio.  And then to call for his firing over this is outrageous.  It's ridiculous.  And why is he held to the same standards or morning shows in general as, like, network news?  We don't have the same leeway there.  They're not.  It's amazing.  But if nappy-headed hoes was an SNL skit, people on Monday would be like,  oh, you watch SNL?  That was hilarious.  But you do it on a morning show, and we have some kind of strange responsibility 
[00:14:30]  when we're doing this crap.  Yeah, all of a sudden, we shouldn't have any responsibility.  It's not 1950.  We're a bunch of dopes with microphones in front of us that couldn't get real jobs.  That's why we're here.  We're not Edward R. Murrow.  Why do we have to have the same standards as, yeah, Edward R. Murrow and Walter Cronkite?  It should all come in with suits and cigarettes.  Go F yourselves.  And you've got black shows that should have no responsibility as well.  And let them say whatever the hell they want about us.  They do.  Yeah, exactly.  They do.  Absolutely do. 
[00:15:00]  But we don't go and protest and picket and call for people's firings.  You talked about that station.  The WLIB when I used to watch, listen to it at work.  And nothing but militant hate speech.  It was what amounted to hate speech against white people, the white government, white communities.  And I would listen.  And I'd bite my cheek.  I'd be like, oh, my God, this is infuriating.  But I'd keep listening because it was interesting to see that point of view. 
[00:15:30]  One thing I wouldn't do is call up and argue that they should be taken off the air.  And they were one of the most racist shows I've ever heard in my life.  And it's not like I'm just cued the team of being heterosexual.  I mean, then I can't.  Right.  Now I can understand some outrage.  You imagine how the college is handling it.  Can you imagine?  We won't tolerate hate.  I would love to see how these little Rutgers douchebags are handling this.  Oh, I'm sure.  It's got to be so melodramatic. 
[00:16:00]  A big to-do.  In general, they've got some quotes in the paper over the weekend from the Rutgers players.  And they're not that outrageous.  How's the rest of the college?  They're really not.  Are they having sit-ins?  They're okay.  They're trying to beat up Imus back and stuff.  What I find interesting, we've got MSNBC on in the studio here.  And Imus has taken off his cowboy hat today.  Yeah, perhaps it's a...  It's the serious Imus.  Yeah, perhaps it's a situation where a cowboy hat isn't the right thing.  I notice he has no cowboy hat today.  No cowboy hat. 
[00:16:30]  I'd stay away from any rebel flags.  Hey, let's go to Jimmy in Boston.  Jimmy, what's up?  Hey, thank God Sheldon didn't hear Slave Girl.  Oh, what happened to that guy's phone?  Ouch.  I don't know what he's talking about.  Hey, that was a fun joke, buddy.  I don't know what he's talking about, man.  Slave Girl, what are you talking about?  Hey, here's the audio of Imus doing what he did.  Boom.  Let's hear it.  To get himself in trouble.  I just read it.  Let's see how unbelievable this was. 
[00:17:00]  That's some rough girls from Rutgers, man.  They got tattoos and some hardcore hoes.  That's some nappy-headed hoes there.  I'm going to tell you that now.  Man, that's some move.  And the girls from Tennessee, they all look cute, you know.  So, like, kind of like a, I don't know, Spike Lee thing.  Yeah.  The Jingaboos versus the Wannabes.  Yeah.  That movie that he had.  Yeah, that was a tough do the right thing.  I don't know if one of the beat Rutgers or not, but they did. 
[00:17:30]  It's a tough watch.  The more looking Rutgers, they look exactly like a Toronto Raptors.  Do you know, that was so sad to be funny.  Yeah, I know.  It was so sad to be funny.  Absolutely.  I know it's scary.  That was so innocent.  Why is it that?  You know how many other things he has said over the years that could have been the thing  that blows up or things we say on our show that could blow up?  Yeah.  That's what's so scary about what we do.  That, also, out of nowhere, that's getting him all this attention. 
[00:18:00]  And did you catch...  Everyone is firing for that?  And Bernie quoted the Jigaboos and the Wannabes.  That's from a school day.  It was a Spike Lee, a sarcastic thing he did about the way black people interacted.  It was really great.  But they would have jumped all over him for that.  If it wasn't a Spike Lee thing.  Right, right.  And why is it like that acceptable?  No, but they are trying to jump all over Bernie for saying that.  Oh, are they?  Oh, yeah.  They've kind of lumped that together with the Imus quote.  Oh.  What is wrong...  Black community is a bunch of babies now.  ...with the black community?  It used to be tough. 
[00:18:30]  What happened?  You got a leadership that is just castrated.  They will not handle serious, real issues in their community because they'd have to turn  that mirror on themselves.  And they never, ever want to do that.  There's always this...  You got to look out and see what white people are doing and somehow twist that into what your  problems are.  The problem in the black community isn't Don Imus saying nappy-headed hoes. 
[00:19:00]  Trust me on this.  I know I'm white.  I'm sorry.  It doesn't...  Maybe I don't understand completely.  But I can guarantee you that Imus saying nappy-headed hoes is not the brunt of the problems  that your resources should now be taken to protest this thing.  I think there are much more important things to look at and perhaps turn your sights on 
[00:19:30]  the community itself.  Like Leonard Jeffries, maybe?  Yeah.  Like, when does the NAACP and Sharpton address the horrible things that...  I think he still works for the University of New York, State University of New York.  Why are they not concerned with what Leonard Jeffries says?  And he's not kidding.  Yeah.  That's protected free speech.  And that's hate speech.  That's protected free speech.  But Imus saying something, obviously in humor, black people, you are as phony as white people.  That's what's happening, is black people have turned into white people. 
[00:20:00]  They're becoming phonies.  You're a bunch of suburban, hypersensitive white women.  How about all the leaders of the NAACP and all the misappropriations of money and...  I mean, that...  How about protesting that?  There are plenty of things you should be looking at before Don Imus.  And here we go.  And then Don had to apologize on Friday.  Oh, for God.  You never want to be doing this.  By the way, you're not listening to him.  Oh, you're listening to his voice, but you're not listening to him. 
[00:20:30]  It's the actor that plays Don Imus?  He, uh...  Yeah.  He's playing a role.  Trust me.  I want to take a moment to apologize for...  Waddle Doodle.  ...an insensitive and ill-conceived remark we made the other morning referring to...  ...the Rutgers women's basketball.  Bone dry, yes.  ...is completely inappropriate and we can understand why people were offended.  Our characterization was thoughtless and stupid.  So, we're sorry.  And that should be it.  He apologized.  That should be it.  Move on.  No. 
[00:21:00]  Fire him.  Move on.  Reverend Al.  I want him fired.  Move on.  He apologized.  It's time to move on.  And he shouldn't have.  I mean, I know he probably had to, but he didn't say anything wrong.  Look, we don't know for sure, but that's not Mr. Imus.  No.  That's a voice talking through Mr. Imus.  Karen Mateo had an interesting...  She said something.  I mean, a spokesperson for CBS said that it was an offensive remark, which was good  to, you know, have the spokesperson chime in.  Why don't spokespeople ever just say, look, he said it, he was kidding, let it go? 
[00:21:30]  It was in jest, let it go.  Why are all spokespeople...  And this is not about Karen.  It's about all...  They are all, like, just such wishy-washy corporate people.  Don't any of them ever defend the people that...  And they're trying to say that's hate speech and not just comedy, right?  It's comedy.  It's comedy.  Spokes comedy show.  Imus's show is a comedy show.  He shouldn't be...  I want to say this again.  He should not be held to the same standards as network TV and all this other crap.  No, it's comedy. 
[00:22:00]  There's a bit of dark comedy thrown in where you can say things like that.  It's outrageous.  It makes you look at your radio and go, what did he just say?  But it's done...  It's not done in hate.  Do you think Don Imus is saying that in hate?  Just stop it already.  And you raise a great point.  The amount of charity work this guy does for sick kids...  It's ridiculous.  Starting this week, he's doing a charity thing.  Starting this week, yeah.  And they want him for those self-centered jackasses, the NAACP and Sharpton, want this guy fired over a dumb joke. 
[00:22:30]  And the amount of charity work he does, can CBS just stick up for him and stop being wishy-washy?  Well, so far, so good.  We'll see how the week develops here.  How about we see how charitable Reverend Al is?  How charitable has he been over the years?  You mean when they're filming him making those little weird, apparently or allegedly illegal transactions in a hotel room 20 years ago?  One of those abscam-looking videotapes they got with Reverend Al in the room.  All right.  Fat Reverend Al, but I don't like...  And Reverend Al, I will never, I will never let the Tawana-Brawley debacle go, where you destroyed people's careers, lives, over a lie that you knew was a lie. 
[00:23:00]  All right.  We got to take a break, but we want to make it perfectly clear we support Mr. Imus today.  Oh, hell yeah.  Big time.  We apologize if we said anything that was...  Offensive, yes, please.  If you have a break, we should apologize, just in case.  Well, you never know.  I mean, you're trying to, like, just entertain and make people laugh in the morning, and you're going to say one dumb thing somewhere along the line, and you're going to get in trouble for it. 
[00:23:30]  It sucks.  It's no way to live.  I mean, in fairness, black people are kind of getting kicked in the teeth with political correctness, too.  Like, they're also getting fired and thrown out for...  Usually, it's Asians that they attack and get bullied.  Everybody is being affected by it, and they've just finally come into, like, a suburban white woman status as far as their sensitivity.  So, welcome.  Hey, how do you babysit a black child? 
[00:24:00]  Oh, you heard this one?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We'll just laugh.  Hey, how many black people does it take to tar a roof?  Oh, yeah.  You heard that one?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, stupid.  You're a hack when it comes to black jokes.  That's all I know.  Hey, we got a break with the Reverend Al song.  Want to do that?  Oh, yeah.  This sums it up.  This is an oldie but goodie.  It's an oldie, but boy, is it relevant every time that idiot is on the news.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:24:30]  Who comes running when the cops get out of hand?  Who thinks the mayor's in the Ku Klux Klan?  Yelling and a-screamin' as he's speaking to a mob.  He wears expensive suits, but he doesn't have a job.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  Well, he's sapping off the people in his own community.  Why is the white man always pickin' on me? 
[00:25:00]  He's got a fat belly and his hair's full of grease.  We hear his battle cry.  No justice, no peace.  The man with a plan who you know you can trust.  The party little reverend with an ass just like a boss.  He's Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  He looks like James Brown with too many calories.  Now why is the white man always pickin' on me? 
[00:25:30]  Remember Bernie Getz and the Brawley case?  Turn on the TV, you would always see his face.  He's speedin' in his limo to another homicide  to make the network news with the family by his side.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  On the never-ending search for some good publicity.  Why is the white man always pickin' on me? 
[00:26:00]  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's coming ground.  I'm hungry.  He's Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He will represent your family and he doesn't charge a fee.  Now as long as the footage makes it on the TV.  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm your pal.  He's your pal.  That's right.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's a raised, fainting white, hatin' beggars for lonely.  Now why is the white man always pickin' on me? 
[00:26:30]  Reverend Al.  Yeah, I'm out.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  I'm your pal.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Shut up, stupid.  You never say the punchline.  You a little scared today?  Uh, yeah.  You're scared to pull the trigger today?  I apologize for the punchlines. 
[00:28:00]  I didn't mean it.  Now on your show, you're just not going to do the punchlines, right?  Yeah.  Hey, America stinks.  Or maybe I'll just do the punchlines.  Uh, uh, you put, um, Velcro on the ceiling.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Stupid, okay, I'm sorry.  I apologize.  All right, all right.  An inappropriate punchline.  Mr. Imus, just do punchlines today.  You won't get in trouble if you just do punchlines.  Okay.  Uh, uh, one if you slice them thin enough.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:28:30]  Okay, I'm sorry.  I apologize.  Just keep saying sorry.  Um, an empty boat.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Uh, what do you call it?  A good start.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, shut up, jerk.  All right, I apologize.  All right, very good.  Uh, yeah.  It, um, has a bite taken out of it. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ah, shut up.  Shut up, stupid.  All right.  I apologize.  Let me tell you why America sucks on this fine Monday morning.  Hey, um.  Maybe not.  Uh, yes, Mr. Imus.  What do you, uh, what do you call a black doctor?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, shut up, jerk.  Wait, I thought you were supposed to just do punchlines.  Well.  I know, exactly.  I want to see how brave Mr. Imus is with his punchlines. 
[00:29:30]  Hey.  Hey, you ever see a, uh, black guy on the Jetsons?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, stupid.  You should have just did the punchline of that one.  That would have been safe.  What, the future looks bright?  I, um, I apologize.  All right, I'll tell you why America sucks.  Waddle doodle.  Waddle doodle to you, Mr. Imus.  Bone dry, yeah.  Linger, uh, longer.  Jerk.  Well, we're watching Mr. Imus. 
[00:30:00]  Everyone's watching Mr. Imus today.  Yeah.  You don't have your, uh, cowboy hat on today.  What's that about?  My kid's bike.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh, you throw them a basketball.  Stupid.  No wonder they do.  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Hey, let's say it, uh, hi to Amanda.  Hi, guys. 
[00:30:30]  Amanda's a regular, uh, caller to the Opie and Anthony show.  Doesn't always agree with us, but, uh, we like Amanda.  The first few times she called, she was yelling and screaming, and she, quite frankly, was very,  very scary.  And then the last couple times, she's been very nice.  So, I don't know, I don't know where she is.  She's a lovely Nubian princess who is married or engaged to a white guy.  A white man, yes.  Yeah, to a white guy.  But she really gets upset sometimes on, uh, our tirades.  Uh, on our, yeah.  Are you a nappy-headed hoe?  I'm not a hoe.  Maybe I have nappy hair. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  I'm not a hoe.  Were you bothered by what Ima said, or did you not care?  You know what?  Um, I thought it was stupid, but it didn't really affect my life.  Yeah.  As a black person, you hear that, right?  Like, can you, can't you tell where that's coming from?  Whether the joke was a good joke or not?  You know what?  It was a bad joke, but I don't think he is a hateful person with a, I don't know, pig  fork.  So, um, I just wanted to say one thing.  Don't yell over me.  I just wanted to say one thing.  I don't agree with Al Sharpton at all. 
[00:31:30]  I think he is actually bad for our community.  I don't think he comes out when there are real issues in our community.  Like, the Madison Square Garden riot.  Oh my God, yeah.  I do think he should have made a statement about it.  I think he helps in keeping our race down.  Um, so I do agree with you guys when you guys talk about that.  But, um, I think with Jimmy talking about the black guy who mugged the poor little white  lady and beat her up.  That is not just a problem with the black community. 
[00:32:00]  I think that's a problem with the world.  I think the problem with the black community was the Madison Square Garden issue.  No, I'll agree with that.  I only said that as an example of, to like, how selective a guy like that, or even the  NAACP is, when they pick on such minute, unimportant things.  I agree with you.  I think Al Sharpton would love to be considered Martin Luther King or the NAACP, but that's  not who he is.  He likes the media.  He likes attention.  And I think he uses the black people to get that attention. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, absolutely.  He has been for years.  I don't think he's a leader as far as I'm concerned.  No.  You're right.  The Garden is a better example, because chances are, the guy hitting that old lady was probably  a drug thing.  That was probably a drug money or something.  I think the better example was the young kids in Madison Square Garden.  That was disgusting, and that's when I think black leaders should have come out and say  something.  There's something going on in our community that we're not facing, and it's not always  the white man doing something.  I'm not saying I don't think you guys are racist bitches. 
[00:33:00]  Right.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  That a girl.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  But I'm just saying, we need to focus on ourselves and stop looking at what's going  on with you guys.  Yeah, I think what Imus said is so just insignificant in the problems that there are so many bigger  problems.  Yeah, why when you get a Madison Square Garden full of young black men and women, does a  riot break out like that?  What was the cause of that? 
[00:33:30]  I think that's what we should focus on.  If Al-Supin wanted to make a real difference, he would start there.  That's where you can make a difference.  You could change the way the world perceives us, but you need to make a difference with  the young community, and that's when he should have gone to their school.  He should have spoken to them about that.  Although, Amanda, in fairness, people could argue the same way that that's also a world  problem, because when you look at sporting events, you look around the world, I mean,  like the way they behave soccer fans.  It happens in soccer, but I'm not worried about them. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, exactly.  You've got to kind of concentrate on this country.  There are different, yeah, different races act differently depending on what part of the  world they're in.  It's just the way it is, you know?  I'm really talking about this country, and I mean, I'm not American, so I'm not African-American,  so we don't have the same issues and the same views.  I mean, they hate when I say that, but I come from a different country where we know  that, yeah, there are racist white people, but you know what?  You're in America. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, where do you come from?  I'd rather not say.  Why?  I kind of...  I just know I'm just from the Caribbean.  I just don't want to let people know who I am.  Caribbean, that's cool.  Okay.  But the point is, we know there are racist white people, but we don't use that as a  crutch to be complete asinine bastards.  You have to understand, too, white people have a burden, too.  Do you know what it's like every time there's sunshine or a good deed when people go,  must be the work of a white fella?  Yeah.  More importantly, I want Amanda to play slave girl with us.  I don't think that's going to be happening. 
[00:35:00]  What happened?  What happened?  I don't think Amanda wants to play that game.  What's a slave girl?  It's just a bit we get into every once in a while on the show.  It's actually...  And it's so innocent.  You know how they do Civil War reenactments?  Uh-huh.  You can go to Gettysburg.  Oh, so I should go be a slave girl?  And they do Civil War reenactments, and they're very entertaining and stuff.  We just decided Friday to do a little reenactment of what might have taken place during a pre-Civil 
[00:35:30]  War into the Civil War days.  That's all.  There you go.  My thing is, as I said again, I can't stand El Sheldon.  I always wanted to say it.  All right.  Thank you, Amanda.  He's got no credibility.  None at all.  None.  And black people hate when he's lumped in as a black leader.  He's not.  Black people are always like, we didn't elect this, guys.  Yeah.  This is a big buff.  Black people are looking for a strong leader.  No one's been able to pick up the ball after Martin Luther King to that extent. 
[00:36:00]  No one's really been able to pick up the ball and run with it and be as much of a crossover.  Oh, sure.  There were, believe me, plenty of people that hated him.  He ended up dead.  But no one has that credibility that he had with the black community.  Huey P. Newton did.  Huey P. Newton did.  And a lot of those guys in the Panthers did.  Yeah, yeah.  But that's, you know, that's another problem.  Like, I don't think he was, I don't think Huey was much of a crossover guy. 
[00:36:30]  No, he was just too liberal for the, and the Jews liked him.  Yeah.  He got a rough one.  Hey, uh, Imus is all.  Huey.  It's all about Imus' first hour.  Imus talks about the nappy comments.  Here we go.  This is from this morning's show.  Friday morning on this program, I apologize for the remarks that we made and I made  about the Rutgers women's basketball team.  And, um, uh, I didn't provide any, uh, context and I didn't think it was appropriate at that  time or is there at any time to provide any excuses or to even provide a context. 
[00:37:00]  But, uh, that was before there'd been any, uh, newspaper articles written.  And in light of, um...  He's panicking.  You can hear it in his voice.  This sucks.  The i-man shouldn't have to panic ever.  No.  He's done nothing but entertain people for 30 years.  But you could have had a long, illustrious career in radio and, and he shouldn't have  to apologize like this.  He's on the, he's on the fence right now.  He doesn't know what's going to happen.  You can hear it in his voice. 
[00:37:30]  Hey.  This sucks.  Hey, Don, we've been there.  We've been there, buddy.  Oh, man.  This company better for once stand by their people and ride this, this thing out.  This guy does so much charity work, does so much stuff for, for sick kid.  And if this company or MSNBC, uh, lets him go or buckles to the pressure of these stupid  organizations, you should just be spit on.  All right.  Let's go back to the audio.  A newspaper article written.  And in light of, um, my feeling over the weekend, and I've talked to everyone, including, 
[00:38:00]  uh, the athletic director at, uh, uh, Rutgers, Bob Mulcahy.  I've talked to Harold Ford 10 times.  I talked to, um, Reverend Forrest Soares last night, uh, and he is making an attempt to get  me together at my request with, uh, the women from Rutgers, the coach, and perhaps their parents.  So we'll see what happens there, but I do think that it's, uh, important that if no one 
[00:38:30]  else understands it, these young women understand, uh, the context in which this is set, not that  that excuse us, the remarks, and please don't anybody think that anything I say this morning  is an attempt to minimize the repulsiveness of the description of these women.  It's not.  But, um, any reasonable person would agree that context and some proportionality is crucial.  Wow.  He's really nervous. 
[00:39:00]  Okay, now I'm calling for Don's firing.  Yes.  I, I, I don't, I don't like how wishy-washy he's gotten.  Oh my God, he's like Johnny Fontaine.  Johnny Fontaine.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  I want to slap him.  He's, there's a little panic in his voice this morning.  Yeah.  The go-bing and the dry mouth.  Jeez.  If he fires out and bomb at somebody angrily, then I can understand this kind of panic and  the, but to, in the context of a joke where he's laughing and just, it's so obvious his  intentions are not to be vicious. 
[00:39:30]  Getting together with the, uh, Rutgers, uh, team, their parents, uh, Reverend, I'm looking  for Shirley Hempel.  Uh, I want to apologize.  Mabel King's legs.  I, I want to apologize to, uh, everybody.  I don't care if you have a tan, come here and I'll, I'll say, I'm sorry.  George Hamilton.  George Hamilton.  I, I apologize.  I, can you apologize to everyone, uh, that went and saw, are we done yet over the weekend?  Cause that's, uh, they need an apology too. 
[00:40:00]  God, Don, you can slow down on the apologies a little.  I think you did a good enough job.  Yeah.  No kidding.  You don't have to go ever.  I actually, uh, I want to go on tour and apologize to every black person in the country.  Personally.  He just wants to walk down the street and apologize to every.  Every black person he sees.  Hi, uh, Don Imus.  I'm sorry.  Next.  Hello?  Anyone home?  I'm sorry.  Don Imus.  All right.  Hey, uh, Imus says he's not a racist.  This always sucks when you gotta go.  I'm not a racist.  I'm never good when you have to say I'm not a racist. 
[00:40:30]  It's never good.  Oh God.  We played the comment earlier that got him in trouble.  Obviously, it was just, uh, done, uh, with humor in mind.  Nowhere's near any type of hate speech.  Oh God.  If you read these newspaper articles and you read that phrase, you think, well, this guy's  a racist.  Well, I'm not a racist and I'm not a bigot.  But they don't know that.  They don't have any reason not to know that.  And when I'm done and when I say, uh, and explain, um, the context of what we do on this 
[00:41:00]  program and what I do and my wife does in our life and how we conduct our life and who  we conduct our life with, am I saying that?  And then do I want these young women to, or do I, do I want you to walk away from this  and say, oh, well, okay.  Then it was okay.  He said that.  No, that's not, that is not what this is about.  But there's a difference between premeditated murder and a gun going off accidentally. 
[00:41:30]  I mean, somebody still gets shot, but the charges are lost.  And there's also a difference between premeditated murder, the gun, going off accidentally, and  then just saying something to somebody, which is what you did.  Shooting a spitball.  It was harmless.  It was harmless.  It was nothing.  There's so much oversensitivity now in the, in the black community and in every, every race,  really, uh, there's so much oversensitivity that when you say anything, uh, uh, gay, uh, 
[00:42:00]  gays, especially the same thing.  You say something that really in the, in the whole scheme of things means nothing.  It's not hurting anybody.  It's a humor.  And they just, they want to jump on and just, I want you fired.  I want your career and your life pretty much ended because of this nothing.  Over one dumb two second line.  I was meant to be humorous.  And instead of just coming out, if they asked black people, what did you think of that?  I go, that was kind of a stupid joke. 
[00:42:30]  That that's all it should have been.  Yeah.  There's nothing.  And, and Spike Lee, we talked about during the break.  I love, I mean, I think his racial stuff is great.  Yeah.  But why is that acceptable to black people?  And yet I'm saying something, uh, using race somehow.  Why is that?  I'm going to go out on a limb here because Spike's black.  All right.  That's just, I hadn't noticed.  Pretty much it.  I'm so colorblind.  I didn't know.  Well, say, I know this last clip is all inclusive.  This last clip.  He'll pay for a prostitute.  No matter what color she is. 
[00:43:00]  She's half and half.  Doesn't matter.  I fit a LIGO.  A LIGO.  Come on, you leopard.  This last clip is going to drive you nuts.  We'll drive you nuts.  Uh-oh.  We'll drive you nuts.  Oh, no.  Ima sounds like he's in, uh, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  Like, like they got to him.  Yeah.  He's just like, chief.  My papa was a big man.  Right.  They got to Mr. Ima.  Oh, no.  And, uh, Reverend Al has been gracious enough, and I actually mean that, to allow me to appear 
[00:43:30]  on his radio program this afternoon.  Now, it's not going to be, you know, he still wants me to be fired, and that's his right.  All right.  And it's not going to be, and it's not going to be easy, but I'm not looking for it to be  easy.  And it shouldn't be easy.  But he, but I am grateful for the opportunity to at least present my case to Reverend Sharpton  and his audience.  Oh, my God. 
[00:44:00]  You know, I, I miss, I miss ventured into the world of shock jockdom, and he doesn't really  know how to respond to it.  I'd be less hurt if he came out of the closet and admitted that it was him in a Michael Jackson  outfit for all those years.  Oh, I miss.  That's the beauty of Imus over the years.  He says all this crap, and he doesn't worry about it.  No one really called him out on it.  And an article came out just recently, and I read it, can't tell you where or who it was.  It was a while ago.  So, um, uh, why is Don Imus untouchable? 
[00:44:30]  Why is he like the Teflon jock?  He gets away with saying all these things and no one ever calls him out on it.  Is it because he has these politicians on?  And I think that article might've gotten people, uh, to start listening to him and go, okay,  when he says something, we're going to call him out on it.  You're right.  And instantly just, you know, the first thing he said that had any, anything, uh, racial  to it, uh, they jumped on him.  Why is it? 
[00:45:00]  This is what I want to know.  Like guys like Imus, it seemed like at one point they wouldn't have went after him because  he wouldn't have cared.  It seemed like they only go after you.  Like the same past thing is different.  That's, I mean, that was a behavior.  That was an action.  There was an arrest, but they, when they, when spoken word, it seemed they only go after  you when they, when they know they can hurt you.  Like all the awful things that are said on this show and not just on the XM side, but here  that are just said to be funny.  Why is there no calls?  I mean, people can say, oh, you know, people listed.  There's enough people listing where people are bothered.  No, no, they wouldn't get an apology.  Eventually it's going to happen.  Eventually we're going to say something stupid and that's going to be the thing to the, the, 
[00:45:30]  the kids out there that want to get into this business.  Don't bother.  You can, you can have an unbelievable career like a Mr. Imus and one lousy line and, and,  and, and your whole career is blown up.  Here's what it is.  It's ridiculous.  The company has to back you up because they have to realize that the,  these boycotts and these protests will not do anything.  Look at the big picture.  Look a month down the road. 
[00:46:00]  Don't look at tomorrow.  Don't look at the threats that are being made by these.  What, what, what, what amount to, uh, uh, uh, terrorists.  They're terrorizing your company and your personalities, threatening them with their jobs and livelihood over what amounts to, uh, what you're free to say.  What the constitution says you are free to say.  It's offensive.  Sure.  But there's a freedom to say it.  And, and, and what they're doing is terrorizing the companies by saying, we're threatening you. 
[00:46:30]  We're holding you hostage until you do what we tell you to do.  As far as this personality is concerned, we want him a fired.  And the companies really have to realize nothing will come of this.  If they leave it for a month, it will just go away.  Some other thing will pop up.  They'll all run to that cause and they'll leave your guy alone.  How about the whole 50 cent game war where some 14 year old was allegedly beaten up by, why don't you concentrate on that? 
[00:47:00]  Right.  And worry about that problem.  Cause it turns the mirror on their own community and that's one thing they don't want to do.  It's got to be, the blame has to be somewhere outside.  No matter how small and innocent it was, you got to pick it up and make it the big, the big issue.  Let's go to Vic.  What's going on?  Black dude.  What's up?  What's going on guys?  Hey Vic.  Listen, black people as a whole don't agree with Al Sharpton.  No one likes Al Sharpton.  And black people as a whole don't, don't find people like I'm just racist or you guys racist. 
[00:47:30]  You know something, Anthony, I bodyguarded your brother at a show.  Jimmy, you and I have a friend in common.  No one, no one cares what Al Sharpton said.  And the masses of black people aren't speaking out.  The media is focusing on what Sharpton is saying.  And honestly, the people that, the company that wants to buy Imus, the people that run  that cup, they're probably more racist than any of us will ever be. 
[00:48:00]  Vic, let me ask you a question.  As a black guy, you hear someone say something, you can, it's almost like when you say to someone  like, man, I'll kill you or I'll kill you.  The intent of where they're coming from when they say it is usually obvious.  I mean, and as a black guy, you hear that.  You don't think this guy is really being horrible when you hear him laughing and being stupid,  dude, I know when something is said is a joke and I know when something is said to be malicious.  Well, apparently Reverend Al doesn't think you do.  And Jesse Jackson doesn't think black people have the capacity to identify when somebody 
[00:48:30]  is joking and someone is authentically speaking out of hate and anger and violence.  Apparently these leaders don't think you guys are capable of figuring this out yourself.  First of all, they're not leaders.  Yep.  There are people that came up in a time where, you know something, the thoughts that they  have were, they were relevant.  When they came up, those thoughts were relevant. 
[00:49:00]  Nowadays, those thoughts aren't relevant and they really need to fall back and let us deal  with our own.  Because, you know something, I don't find, I don't find, I don't find anything wrong with  what Imus said.  Personally, in other situations, like with the police officers, if I feel someone has a gun,  I'm going to shoot them.  All right, thank you, Vic.  Thanks a lot, Vic. 
[00:49:30]  Thank you.  We've got to move on because we're late for a break.  Got a Imus clip right here.  Yeah.  I was only joking.  There you go.  All right.  It's okay, then.  I was only joking.  Okay.  Hey.  It's closed.  Hey there, Imus.  Really fast before the break, because we're going to try to move on to other things today,  I want to thank David Hinckley for dragging me into the Imus story.  Out of nowhere, like all of New York, because, you know, the newspaper in general, you read  an article here or there, but everyone's going to read the Imus stuff, and I'm featured in 
[00:50:00]  one of the stories here.  Great.  And it's a little story I told on the air here that I guess Mr. Hinckley never forgot.  But he basically, in his column, is talking about, it was noted on Jackson's show, Jesse  Jackson's show, that had 50 Cent made the same remark, no one would have noticed, and  that similar comments have been heard on hip-hop radio.  So if you're black, you can say nappy-headed ho, but if you're white, you better not say  nappy-headed ho.  But while Jackson and others warned that this helped put offensive phrases into general  circulation, there was unanimous agreement on black radio yesterday that Imus had no 
[00:50:30]  license to pick it up and say it, even though a black guy, that's what drives us crazy.  More separation.  That's the key to us all getting along in this country.  A little more separatism.  I think that's beyond insane when you say, look, I'm black, that's why I can say the  N-word, and I can say all these other things, but if you're white, you better not say any  of these words.  Let's all get together as a nation and a people, but let's make us separate. 
[00:51:00]  We can say it, you can't.  That is insane in America.  Yet, if there's one thing, what are white people allowed to say that black people can't?  How about that?  You want to have a certain set of rules?  Oh, please.  There's nothing.  Why not?  Because the second you try to say something like that, you become a white separatist.  Oh, right.  You're right.  But black people, when they say, choose, pick and choose what they can say and white people  can't, you don't look at that as separatism.  That's unity in the community.  Right.  There you go.  There you go.  Ah, the article continues.  Their response echoed a recent story by morning co-host Opie. 
[00:51:30]  Opie used to play basketball every day in his neighborhood, he said, and the black players  regularly called each other the N-word.  So after one of the teammates hit a nice shot, Opie said he incorporated the N-word into  his congratulations.  As he described it, the word was barely out of his mouth when he was flattened.  Flattened.  Flattened.  I learned, he said.  The fact they used it didn't make it okay for me to use it.  That's not what I said, by the way.  I was amazed that, oh, whatever. 
[00:52:00]  That you got flattened.  Right.  For saying that to a friend, by the way.  Because everyone else on the basketball court was using it.  Ah, whatever.  But, you know, the fact that when you point something out to Jesse Jackson, who just irritates  me, you point something like that out to him, and then his excuse isn't, oh, he can't  just go, oh, yeah, that is true.  Well, that didn't give him like, no, no, that's not the issue, stupid.  Yeah.  Why don't you and your stupid too wide eyes for your face, he looks like a South Park character,  I've had enough of Jesse Jackson, why don't you address the fact that black people are 
[00:52:30]  saying it and go after them?  And how come that whole Hymeetown thing got so played down?  Well.  Like, every time people brought it up when he was running for president, they said, well,  this is a guy who called New York City Hymeetown, a horrible anti-Semitic slur that he used.  And the explanation was, ah, it was so long ago, don't even worry about it, he's so changed.  You think that would actually wash in the black community if it was reversed?  If somebody said an awful racial slur against black people and then was running for office, 
[00:53:00]  that the black people wouldn't be outraged and calling for this guy's immediate dismissal  from his running for office?  It's just there's this awful double standard in hypocrisy.  You could also make the argument, real quick, that there are racist white people that like  guys like Sharpton and Jesse Jackson because they're clowns and they're really no threat to  get anything done, they're not viable black leaders, they're not Malcolm X. 
[00:53:30]  All right, we got a break, we're really, really late.  Quickly, I just want to make it perfectly clear, by the way, that I am not related to  Don Imus.  That's right.  I want to make it perfectly clear, oh, it's been fun and games, he's my father and all  that, he might have banged my mom at an Islander game back in the early 70s, but today I want  to make it perfectly clear that I have no relationship with Mr. I.  Oh, how could you sell the man out like that when he needs you the most?  It was all fun and games, but if you look closely, we don't look anything alike. 
[00:54:00]  You're a horrible son.  He does not look like my father in any way.  Terrible son.  And how could you say he's not my dad, even though he banged my mom in the early 70s?  No, he, well, that's what he said.  Hey, he gave me the props, he said early 70s at an Islander game, so I'm not going to argue  the point.  A son should stand by his father in these troubled times, Opie, that's terrible.  All right, just hit that, it's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:54:30]  The Opie and Anthony virus.  That's right, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie virus spreading across America.  The argument, the discussion continued through the break with the one, the only Tom Chiusano  representing the corporate side again.  I don't know.  Many, many different points of views in this room.  Just let him be, because if we talk too much, he's going to come walking back down the hall.  Tom's shaking his fist and saying the only answer is separation of the races. 
[00:55:00]  I mean, that was just a little much.  Hey, what else is America talking about today?  I guess it's the fourth anniversary of the U.S. troops capturing Baghdad.  Hey, how about that?  So we get to see the video of the statue going down?  Uh-huh.  That was supposed to be so much more dramatic four years ago when we finally captured Baghdad  and we yanked down the statue of Saddam Hussein.  They couldn't get him off that pole? 
[00:55:30]  They were really hoping for a dramatic, like, the thing falls to the ground, big, huge noise  and dust everywhere.  Yeah.  Instead, it just went...  Tipped over.  And got stuck halfway down.  Should have known right then and there this might be a problem.  Yeah.  But that was four years ago today, believe it or not.  Oof.  You'll see that video all over the TV.  Also, some dude named Zach Johnson won the Masters, so there's a lot of jokes today in  the paper about Masters and Johnson. 
[00:56:00]  Is that funny?  I used to hear that funny.  No, there isn't.  And Tiger came in second.  He kind of blew it at the end there.  Mets home opener today, whatever.  That's important for the New Yorkers.  What else?  Oh, weekend talk.  You know what they call Tiger Woods?  A good golfer.  See, it's the new Imus.  Yeah.  The safe Imus.  Apologize.  The safe Imus.  Sorry.  Jerk.  Also...  Stupid.  There's a...  Also, we laughed because we didn't think this was possible, but it did happen. 
[00:56:30]  You put a help wanted sign in the window.  A few more punchlines, I...  I understand.  Yeah.  If you just do the punchlines, you'll be okay.  Are you ready there, Mr. Imus?  Um...  An oil spill.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's a funny one.  I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, shut up, stupid.  At the box office.  Oh, we pushed hard, too, for the boys, but... 
[00:57:00]  And we joked about this.  We said this is impossible.  But it just shows you how dumb America is in general.  Are we done yet?  A movie with Ice Cube that got zero stars pretty much across the board.  The reviews on this thing were beyond awful.  What did Rotten Tomatoes give it?  Like a 16 rating out of 100?  Something like that?  Is that good?  Nine.  A nine.  Nine.  It went down.  Nine.  Nine.  And that means 91% of all reviews across America said this movie blows.  Okay?  Grindhouse got just amazing reviews by the same movie reviewers. 
[00:57:30]  And as Americans, we decided that we needed to see Are We Done Yet? over Grindhouse.  That is unbelievable.  Grindhouse got an 83% good review rating.  I'm happy about that.  Why?  Because I liked Grindhouse, and I think that Ice Cube's movie probably stinks, but I do  like the fact that nobody listened to the critics.  That I kind of like.  Even though in this case, they probably should have.  I think it's a bigger issue.  We were talking about this last week.  Doing designation?  Well, they show you a dumb commercial for this movie, and as Americans, we don't do any 
[00:58:00]  of our own research, and we're like, must see, are we done yet?  Like a bunch of lemmings, and we marched to the theater.  The trailer looked awful.  The advertisement in the paper looked awful.  It was this big half a page and full page of just the Ice Cube falling backwards on a  ladder with a goofy look on his face, and his family peeking around the house smiling, 
[00:58:30]  and a raccoon on the ladder, and a paint bucket that's falling on the ground.  It just looked stupid.  And we played the trailer, Jimmy.  It was so uncomfortable.  I was here.  Listen.  Oh, you were here?  I wasn't sure if you were in Miami or anything.  I laughed a lot.  No, you didn't.  I didn't.  Shut up.  You didn't.  Remember the part?  I saw this.  I'm like, I said this out loud.  He's in the woods.  You know, black people in the woods are not as common, so it's kind of like person out  of place.  Yeah.  And he sees the deer, and the deer's eyes open, and his eyes open, and they go that  way.  They run away, you know?  Well, here's your top movies for the weekend. 
[00:59:00]  You got Grindhouse in fourth place.  You got Are We Done Yet in third place.  You got Meet the Robinsons.  And then, finally, Blades of Glory just kicking ass at the box office, number one again this  week.  That bastard makes a lot of money.  Will Ferrell.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  So, I don't get it.  I mean, you can't even compare the two movies.  But, like I said, you see the commercial, and you got to be a lemming and just march to  the theater and see it.  We're lame as Americans.  Lame. 
[00:59:30]  And then, did you have something, Jimmy?  No, no, no.  I wanted to say that black movies and white...  See, black movies, it's almost like a Spanish station in a city.  It's like black people are mostly going to go see black movies.  It's kind of a weird way to look at it.  You have to compare that to other black movies.  You can't compare that to Grindhouse, because all black people are not going to run out and  see Grindhouse.  Yeah.  They'll see it, but just not in opening weekend.  Why go see The Cube, though, like that?  I don't know.  Oh, God.  That's disturbing to me.  And Grindhouse was awesome. 
[01:00:00]  It was a great movie.  Tarantino movie was pro-female.  Lunacy, can't believe you liked it.  Who said lunacy?  It's a good word.  Michael in Brooklyn.  Yeah, yeah.  I said lunacy.  Hi, Mike.  Hey there, Mike.  Why?  What's up?  I went to see it the first showing Friday.  It was a high noon showing here in Brooklyn.  Really, really crowded theater.  Lots of blacks.  Lots of everybody, you know.  Really mixed crowd. 
[01:00:30]  A lot of people walked out during Tarantino's movie.  Did they like the first one?  I can't believe you guys were just kissing his ass so much last week.  Yes.  This movie is god-awful.  I didn't think it was god-  Dude, A, yes, we were kissing his ass because we love him.  Because he's Tarantino.  But also-  It's not like this is his first movie.  You have to-  It's not like this movie got panned.  I mean, a lot of people who have seen this movie really loved it.  Some people-  I thought the order was a little weird, but I didn't think it deserved to be trashed.  What about-  Why are you screaming?  Hold on.  Before you-  Remember, you're talking about a movie that got a 90% positive review across America. 
[01:01:00]  There's two different movies.  There's two different movies.  Yeah, I would say the first movie was better than the second, but I enjoyed both movies.  Absolutely, and I enjoyed that his movie had a nice little twist at the end instead of  the same old effing ending that you get from horror movies.  How straight men could you guys be defending that movie?  You know what?  Because I'm confident in my sexuality, you ass.  I can handle a woman getting the upper hand every once in a while.  There's nothing wrong with that. 
[01:01:30]  Is that being homo?  Don't challenge us as straight men, you dope.  Yeah, come over here.  I'll kick you on the mouth.  If you didn't like the ending because it was pro-female, that's your business, but  to challenge us as straight men, you're nuts.  Well, I've had a few experiences.  Dude, I think that the film's- your argument would probably be more valid if you said the  film should have been reversed.  Maybe Tarantino should have went first for pacing reasons.  But yeah, it was awful in so many respects.  It was way too talky.  They're completely pretentious.  I told Jimmy that a couple of scenes could have been cut down just a little bit, so I'm 
[01:02:00]  not going to argue that point with you.  But I think the car chases were amazing.  I thought the ending with the nice twist was really funny and cool and different.  I'll tell you what I-  And I think Stuntman Mike as a character was just awesome.  What I didn't like about it, I'll tell you what I didn't like about it.  I felt that both movies, neither one of them had the pressure of the plot because they  were both just a bunch of scenes that were kind of put there to lead up to something  cool.  So that kind of removes some of the pressure to have like a steady plot through the whole  thing.  That's my only criticism of it.  But still, the first one is so much fun, even though the plot was so thin. 
[01:02:30]  I mean, it was just- it was an example of how great, you know, it could be.  And it's worth it to go by the ticket to see that first one and the trailers.  But there was something incredibly deranged about this Tarantino character.  His last two movies, he's on this complete, you know, like anti-male trip.  Maybe it's just different for him as an artist to write female characters because you're  writing for all these, like, don't- you know, look at the Reservoir Dogs.  Look at Pulp Fiction.  He's written so many strong or interesting male characters. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, the first two movies were good.  You know, they were- they were so much different than everything else that came out.  True romance.  And also, True Romance, he wrote.  And he also wrote- he's annoyed now, but he wrote The Natural Born Killers.  He's written a lot of great things.  Yeah, and he's always-  The early stuff.  The early stuff is good.  He's gone into-  Kill Bill?  Both Kill Bills were supposedly very good movies.  You gotta respect the guy that he comes up with a new spin on the same old movie.  As if the American woman needs any more encouragement to be-  Oh, wow, this guy's- 
[01:03:30]  All right, you're scared of the female.  Dude, what's wrong with American women?  Hold on, what's wrong with American women having some encouragement?  Seriously?  You're not even kidding.  I was saying, as if they need more encouragement to be more obnoxious and charmless and gender-  It's not like they're going to be grabbing samurai swords and cutting us up.  Don't worry, sir.  Yeah, dude, this-  Now, what's your issue with women?  Is mommy a little cold?  Do you like foreign women?  Like Spanish girls or Filipino girls?  Foreign women are more interesting.  Why?  How are they more interesting?  Besides the fact they were sitting here on a-  You know, a lot of them are on a slave ship and have to pay off debts in a Yankee Cranky shop. 
[01:04:00]  How are they more interesting?  No.  Seriously.  It's not a mommy issue.  Okay.  It's some weird gender war issue, you know, that for some weird reason he's completely-  Are you-  On the female side.  Wait a minute, is that a gender war?  We're talking about you now.  Yeah, we're talking about you.  Are you secure with your sexuality?  Yes.  Did you get-  All right, so what's the problem seeing a girl kick ass?  What is the problem with that?  Mike, seriously.  What was the problem in Kill Bill seeing those girls just completely kick ass? 
[01:04:30]  It was completely different than every other movie you've seen in that genre that came before.  What's wrong with Quentin Tarantino having a different spin on things?  Where does this weird resentment-  Look, I resent women sometimes too.  I'm not going to lie to you.  And it's because I got shot down a lot in high school.  It's my own crap.  I know what it is.  And there's times where it comes out and I'm annoyed at women.  What is your thing with women?  Seriously, I'm not even breaking your balls.  I'm asking.  I don't think it's a thing with women.  It's just, I don't feel like I have a thing with women. 
[01:05:00]  The American woman has become so unfun to be around and so charmless.  How do you mean charmless?  It's a gender power kind of trip that they're on.  And either you agree with me or you don't.  Well, I'm asking you more to clarify.  Because I don't know if I disagree with you, but I just know that my resentments with women come because as a group, they're the ones that could devastate me more than anybody.  And they always make me feel worthless because I can't have the ones I want typically.  I mean, that's where my stuff has come from.  And you're not showing any examples of why you feel like this. 
[01:05:30]  This movie obviously hit a nerve with you.  I watched the movie and went, oh, this is kind of cool and different.  That's all I was thinking as I left the theater.  Your statement is leading me to believe this is transcending just the movie.  Right.  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  I mean, all the media has, you know, transcends itself because it's communicating to such a large, you know, population of people.  And it informs the whole psychology of the whole culture.  I think, you know, the whole country. 
[01:06:00]  He's not talking about himself.  No, you're not being honest about why you feel that way.  Like, I don't believe the whole charmless thing.  Michael, we'll give you another chance later on this morning.  You've got to, like, get your thoughts together here.  Yes, please.  We're going to hang up.  If you want to call back, that would be great.  We're not blowing you off.  But, I mean, answer Jimmy's question.  The question, once again.  I'm asking what exactly is it, like, in your personal life or your experience as women that's giving you this weird vibe?  Because don't just stop putting it off on the media and this and that.  I explain why I have my weird things.  I'm not putting it off because why does it have to be internalized into something personal? 
[01:06:30]  Because you just said there's a gender war.  Cultural issues, cultural matters.  You've got a gender war, dude.  You sound panicky.  Like, every movie that comes out from now on has to have the women just being completely empowered.  Or that whatever world you're living in, these women are like Amazons and they're, you know, emasculating the men.  And you're saying things like American women are charmless and power hungry and foreign women.  Maybe he equates foreign women with being slightly more submissive. 
[01:07:00]  I don't know.  I'm actually curious as to why.  Yeah, you're not giving an example of in real life what women are doing that is giving them this power and no charm and no sense of humor.  So, please.  It's just from living here in New York City and the way that men and women talk to each other, you know, at work and just in all aspects.  It's just a lack of respect for men kind of.  Well, people that live in New York City in general stink.  Yes, they're awful.  Do you get shot down a lot, dude?  I mean, look, I have in my life.  I'm not lying. 
[01:07:30]  I've been shot.  My fair share also.  But, you know, I know when something is coming from, you know, an irrational place within inside me.  And I don't think this is where it's coming from.  I'm talking about some totally weird, like, totally beyond all boundaries, anti-male kind of sensibility.  You know, and our society is becoming, like, too feminized.  And then there's this weirdo Tarantino coming out of nowhere with this extreme anti-male sensibility. 
[01:08:00]  Dude, it's not anti.  You're right about the society becoming a bunch of mo's.  We really are.  That's a good point you're making.  But Tarantino is just a filmmaker trying to do something different and interesting because he's made strong male characters.  You're confusing the two.  You're taking what a guy did.  Maybe it didn't work for you, but you're making that like it's this giant social issue.  And it's not.  Alice Crandon was a feminist since the 50s.  She was smashing her fat husband.  All right.  Listen, Michael, we got to go.  All right.  All right.  We'll agree to disagree on this one.  Okay.  All right. 
[01:08:30]  I'll see you through a hole in a stall somewhere on the restroom.  All right.  Can I point out one little story which has been making me chortle all morning?  Chortle.  Chortle.  Indian severs off his genitals.  Oh, ow.  A 29-year-old man identified as a Chandra has been admitted to this hospital.  He allegedly severed his penis inside his home.  And I don't know where Fintas is, but he learned his wife wanted to marry another man.  And the Daily Quote, a security source of the man, he got a letter from her. 
[01:09:00]  He said she wanted to divorce and marry someone else.  So he cut his penis off and they couldn't put it back.  And I'm just thinking, that's probably actually, that's like less than she would have gotten  in the divorce.  But I don't know why men react this way to a woman.  Idiot.  Whenever you hear, and they couldn't put it back.  Yeah.  It's like, now what do you do?  Yeah.  The doctor just looks down and goes.  If you had to do that to yourself, would you do it with a knife and saw? 
[01:09:30]  Or would you just put it with an ax, like one shot and sever cleanly all the tendons?  I wouldn't, there's no situation where you can make me say how I would do it because  it's so out of.  No, there's got to be a way to do it, Ann, if you're going to do it.  I'm holding it right now, just with this conversation.  Jimmy, I'll answer your question.  I would take a tuna fish can, I would make sure it's very rusty, the lid, and then have  at it.  So you get an infection and die.  Yeah, why not?  Shortly after.  Because there's no reason to live after that. 
[01:10:00]  Or I would do it like my fingers, like Doc didn't escape from Alcatraz, and then Clint  would plink them into a little wood box.  Plink.  All right, we've got a break.  We're going to catch up a little bit.  I'm going to go straight in time out in that office.  Yeah.  Hey, who saw the Sopranos last night?  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony! 
[01:10:30]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Jimmy, guess what we saved for you, because you were on the road last week.  Kisses?  No, no kisses today.  Henry Winkler, PSA from 1984.  Fonzie!  We saved that one for you, old Jimmy Norton.  Yay!  We're going to get to that in a little bit.  Can I put out a quick request?  I need a fat girl for Wednesday.  I'm doing the photo cover.  What?  I'm doing the photo shoot for my book cover, and I need a fat girl to be on the cover. 
[01:11:00]  Attention, fat girls.  You will be paid.  We need you.  Jimmy needs you.  Oh, you can be paid, too, huh?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's a paid gig.  Attention, fatos.  And what?  How do they get a hold of you?  They can email me at yellowtreats at AOL.com.  That's a good question.  Thank you.  But it has to be on Wednesday, and you will be paid.  Oh, very good.  Thank you.  All right.  Sopranos debuted last night.  It was really funny.  I came into work around 5 a.m., and Ann and I like to see the Sopranos. 
[01:11:30]  And what do you say?  You're like, ah, effing Sopranos.  And I'm like, people have got to stop.  Every Monday for the last, I would say, two seasons, maybe three seasons, every Monday,  effing Sopranos, another show with no action.  It was, here was my problem.  I could understand running through the season, and then midway through, you get an episode  like that, which I called On Golden Pond.  The On Golden Pond episode.  It was On Golden Pond.  You were waiting for Tony to go into the forest. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  I got lost.  I was waiting for some kind of frigging, it was awful.  That is not a season opener to the final season of a show like The Sopranos.  You don't open it with a family get-together.  All right, the fight was cool, and then there's two seconds of gunplay action.  It wasn't an exciting episode.  They haven't had action in The Sopranos for a long time now. 
[01:12:30]  Every once in a while, they throw you a bone.  Your first episode, though, should be action-packed.  That's supposed to grab you to watch the rest of these.  I'm not going to sit and watch.  What's next week?  The Sopranos version of Steel Magnolias?  It's awful.  They did play Monopoly during The Sopranos last night.  That was good.  It looked like it was kind of like a Lake George, right?  Was it Lake George?  Yeah, I don't know.  A little lake house?  Small upstate lake.  And it was Tony hanging out with his sister, and then there was a significant other. 
[01:13:00]  Bobby.  I watched 25 minutes of it.  I TVO'd it, and I'm never in bed before one.  I went to bed by 10.30 last night.  I was bored.  It put you to sleep.  I was bored.  God damn that show.  The fight scene was awesome, but it took way too long to get into anything.  It came out of nowhere.  It was kind of like, whoa, what the hell's going on here, and how is this going to affect  things?  And then it was like over, and then back to, you know, hey, what are we eating? 
[01:13:30]  Oh, great.  They're by the lake.  Look, Tony's sitting by the lake in his chair.  He's contemplating.  Great.  Let's watch Tony contemplate.  All they needed was a Melfi scene, and I just shot myself.  The Melfi scene was really cool, though, when Omar pulled out the shotgun and then robbed  all the drug dealers of not only the package, but the entire shipment.  Oh, wait.  Sorry.  That was The Wire.  That was a show with action.  Jimmy loves The Wire.  Who doesn't?  Everyone loves it.  So The Wire was...  I watched it on DVD.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:14:00]  All right, all right.  So damn annoying to sit through a show like that first episode of the last season.  That's why I'm mad.  I'm not mad.  But I'll sit through those episodes.  I know they got to do those sometimes.  Well, you just sit through.  It's called a dynamic.  You need some high points with a lot of action.  If it was all action every week, you might get a little bored with it.  But you don't put that as your first episode.  I'm sorry.  There's only eight left now, right?  One down, eight to go?  One down. 
[01:14:30]  Eight of those to sit through.  And David Chase, enough with the shot.  They had Tony and Bobby in the boat on the lake.  And it was a far shot done from the woods.  Like, oh, who's watching them?  Do you think that's what that was?  He's done those shots forever.  It's that...  They want you to think that, you know, there's surveillance.  There's surveillance.  I just thought it was a long, dramatic shot.  No, but he's trying to be artsy with it.  Like, look, you know, they never know who's watching them at any given time.  They're not even safe in a boat, in a lake, in the middle of nowhere. 
[01:15:00]  It's like, is it the feds watching them?  Is it someone that wants Tony dead?  Enough with those dumb shots.  I was waiting for the boat to blow up or something.  Some kind of action thing.  And no, they were just fishing off of it.  You actually thought there was a possibility the boat was going to blow up?  I got to watch Tony fish.  There you go.  We watched Tony fish.  That's all you get.  We watched them play Monopoly.  We watched them eat.  It was wonderful.  We watched Tony's sister talk with Tony's wife. 
[01:15:30]  That was great.  And they got to sing some karaoke.  Singing a little karaoke.  Carmella singing Love Hurts.  Come on.  That has to mean something.  What the...  What were they doing?  Do you know how great it would have been if Tony and Pauly Walnuts were killed in the  first episode?  And then the other seven or eight episodes was just about Meadows' struggles at school.  And then they had like...  Then they had like Janice going back to school for her GED.  But she couldn't figure out algebra because she's always had problems with it. 
[01:16:00]  And then they deal with her dyslexia for the last five episodes.  That's all it's about.  And roll credits.  How great would that be?  Too bad they don't have the balls to just kill off Tony in the first episode.  And then have all hell break loose for the remaining eight to see who ends up with control.  They don't have the balls to do that.  The last episode, you're going to probably see Tony die.  That's what I'm thinking.  Wow.  Do you think they'll do that?  I think that...  I don't think they'll do that either.  I think he gets shot in an ice cream shop. 
[01:16:30]  No, they'll leave it.  In an ice cream shop.  How is that it?  Would you see that on the internet?  No, the last scene was filmed in an ice cream shop, so I'm thinking, you know...  Probably orders an ice cream.  A nice family little thing.  Yeah, probably he just orders an ice cream.  I'm thinking he orders ice cream.  And drives away.  Credits.  He orders ice cream, he gets frozen yogurt, and then there's a whole big mafia to-do.  They're not going to wrap up anything.  You're going to have some dramatic, ridiculous ending that leaves you with too many questions 
[01:17:00]  and not enough answers.  Why can't they do something that no one sees coming?  Like, the last scene is Carmella opens the bathroom door in the ice cream shop, and Tony's  kneeling and servicing a guy with a mop who is possibly from the Philippines, and then  the credits just come up, and that's the end.  It doesn't explain it or anything.  No.  Tony just pisses off everybody.  Yeah, he's gay.  He likes ice cream shop boys.  He was gay the whole time.  Yeah. 
[01:17:30]  Gay the whole movie.  How great.  People would have to die.  Make Tony gay the whole time.  Last episode.  I'm just...  I was a little disgusted, that's all.  Christopher wasn't in it.  First episode.  Paulie Walnuts.  Not a sign of him.  It just...  Where were the guys?  It's the first episode.  You got to start moving a storyline.  Not have him sit there by lakeside eating and fishing and playing Monopoly and singing karaoke. 
[01:18:00]  Well, we're going to have Frank Vincent call in about 15 minutes.  Oh, and I'm going to give him a piece of my mind.  You mean Frank Vincent, the guy that wasn't in the episode?  Hey, he was in a bar drinking for like two seconds.  He had his Goodfellas party scene.  Yep.  Yeah, there was another lousy party at a bar.  Yeah, they were just partying and talking about Tony being arrested on a gun charge.  I think he's the best character on the show.  Yeah.  He's Frank Vincent.  I love him.  Let's go to Terry in Montana.  Terry, what's up, though?  Him or Janice?  Sorry.  Janice stinks.  Love you.  Love the show.  Hey. 
[01:18:30]  Wah.  Anthony, you got it all wrong, man.  I'm sorry.  I love you.  Yeah.  They're setting up for something big.  They mentioned the RICO Act.  I'm telling you, just be patient with it, man.  They say that every season they're setting up for something big.  Something big.  What, the fat cast members?  God almighty.  What do they do?  Just eat bread in the offseason?  Does anybody do shit-ups?  That Janice.  Did you see that beach ball with legs?  Dude, she turned at one point.  Oh, my God.  And me and my girlfriend looked at each other. 
[01:19:00]  And I just went, what a mess this woman is.  I could not believe how big.  She looked like the M&M character.  Yeah, she's got like-  You know, the big M&M and then the thin legs.  She's got the skinny legs.  Right.  And her body is completely browned.  And she's just got this bunt that was sticking out.  It was awful.  Amazing.  She waddles.  She can't even walk.  She waddles from scene to scene.  An amazing mess.  Because she's not supposed to be that fat because she still has the thin legs. 
[01:19:30]  Oof.  I met her.  That awful tat.  I got a photo with her.  And, you know, she goes, well, I have to take it this way.  And she stood behind me and kind of hung on my shoulders.  Oh, no.  I swear to God, because she was self-conscious.  She might as well hide behind a tree.  With sunglasses on.  With sunglasses for a promotional shot for a radio station.  What?  What did I say?  Oh, my God.  Why would I do that?  I like that.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  Way to go.  Wait, I heard a person on a day like this with Imus.  All right. 
[01:20:00]  I guess Howard's obsessed with our ratings and regular radio.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, well.  Why, is he talking about Boston?  I heard that one through the roof.  Boston just rocked.  Buffalo just rocked.  I don't know what comes in today.  We'll have to wait and see.  Why is he obsessed with anything that has to do with regular radio?  He's not on it anymore.  We are.  Shut up.  Yeah.  So you got us by talking about how bad we might be doing in a city or two.  Clam up.  Yeah, you got us.  I don't know what to tell you about that.  Let's say hi to Jen in Virginia. 
[01:20:30]  Jen, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys?  Love the show.  Thank you.  Hold on.  But the Janice thing, because I got distracted.  Yeah.  We did the same thing, like, holy crap, is it possible to get your body into that shape?  She is a mess.  Just an awful mess.  And she's got a Rolling Stones tattoo on her boob, right?  Yeah.  That thing's getting a bit stretched out.  Oh, God.  Looking a bit distorted.  Awful.  It's starting to look like a mouth on the scream mask.  See, that's why you're better than me.  I knew there was something there, and I couldn't come up with it, so I just had to go with 
[01:21:00]  it's getting stretched out.  There you go.  That's the line.  Go ahead, Jen.  Hey, I just had a comment on the Sopranos last night.  I thought the episode wasn't all that great, but the funniest part to me was when Tony had  the Monopoly house stuck to his face.  All right.  That was funny.  Yeah.  The fight scene was amazing.  After the fight, and he gets up, and he had a Monopoly house stuck on his face.  The Mella swung it off, and it went flying across the room. 
[01:21:30]  That, to me, was the best part of the show.  Yeah.  I thought it was terrible.  All right.  I'm distracted again, because it is coming in like crazy.  Howard is making fun of us because we got a 0.0 rating in Vegas.  Did we?  We just started in Vegas.  It's way too early to tell.  Could someone call up Howard and tell him he has a 0.0 in all of radio?  You dope.  Could a pest call him up and say, Howard, you're making fun of Opie and Anthony because they  have a 0.0?  I don't even know if that's true.  I know it's too early to tell as far as ratings go in Vegas. 
[01:22:00]  So he's mocking us for having a 0.0.  He has a 0.0 in regular radio across the board.  Everywhere.  You dope.  Just because you weren't smart enough to make the deal we made, you're going to mock us?  Yeah, and he was stupid enough to just take a deal where he gets every Friday off and gets  8 billion weeks of vacation and half a billion dollars.  You're an idiot.  Yeah, but he's frustrated that he doesn't have the same exposure, and that's what really  motivates him. 
[01:22:30]  You know, he has a 0.0 in New York, a 0.0 in Boston, a 0.0 in Philly, a 0.0 in Buffalo,  a 0.0 in Dallas.  Oh, my God.  Go across the board.  All 25 of our markets is what we should do.  So could the Pest call him up and go, hello, hello, you have a 0.0 everywhere.  Talking to a hell of a lot more people than he is.  Yeah.  And he's going to mock us?  What an ass.  Good luck to you. 
[01:23:00]  Isn't it time for another day off, you dope?  Or another, or isn't today the day you get your hair done at a parlor?  0.0.  Mr. Blue, Mr. Blutarski.  Are you nuts?  He's nuts.  He's sitting there laughing.  No one's hearing that you, that you just said that.  We had to tell people that you said that.  How does that make you feel?  We had to pass on your mocking of us.  Right.  Or else it wouldn't have been heard. 
[01:23:30]  Right.  I want that quoted somewhere.  Howard has a 0.0 in regular radio.  We might have a 0.0 in a market or two because it's too early to tell.  I don't even know.  But you have a 0.0 across the board, my friend.  Give me the goddamn ratings.  Let's say hi to Rob in Vegas.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, Rob.  Yeah, last night, the part that struck me about the show was, if you notice, at the 
[01:24:00]  beginning of the show, when they show the opening credits, it took four writers to put that  episode together.  Yeah, four writers.  Four writers.  I guess one was in charge of Monopoly.  One was in charge of them eating.  Yeah.  You're going to write the eating scenes.  You, I want something really good out of you.  You have the fishing scene.  Yeah.  Who was in charge of how much Ventnor Avenue costs?  Yeah.  They ought to get people to research Monopoly. 
[01:24:30]  I was sitting there last night going, am I really watching the Soprano characters play  Monopoly?  Play Monopoly?  I know they were setting up for a fight, but it's like, this is the best the writers could  come up with?  There was drama in that when they were kind of arguing over if the money from Community,  Chest, and Chance should go into the free parking pile.  Well, because I play like that too, but technically, it's right.  Bobby Bacala was right.  It's not in the rules.  It's not.  So that added like this mystery to it.  Is it in the rules?  Isn't it? 
[01:25:00]  Free parking is technically, hold on, a place just to rest your head.  Just to rest.  You're not supposed to get money from it.  But I always liked playing the cheating way.  I liked it too.  Big pile of money in the middle.  Gave you something to count.  You know, I'll call one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.  Okay.  Come on, seven.  Come on, seven.  Fantastic.  I used to, when I was a little boy, I didn't want to be an astronaut.  I wanted to be the man with the mustache in the Monopoly game and the little tailcoat.  Ah, he was rich.  He won a beauty contest. 
[01:25:30]  Money bags.  All right.  And Chris from...  And ten bucks.  That guy's a douche.  Chris from Georgia.  Go ahead, Chris.  Good morning.  Love you guys and love the show.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, boy.  Thank you.  Isn't it ironic that ManCal has more listeners than Howard right now?  You know, that is true, by the way.  And it's sad.  As much as we hate the ManCal, he does have more listeners than Howard.  That is a fact.  And he's in, like, eight crappy markets.  Yeah.  If that.  I think five.  All right.  Bobby on Long Island. 
[01:26:00]  Bobby!  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  Yo, Anthony.  When you mentioned Janet last night, turned around by the fridge.  I know that's exactly what you and your girlfriend were talking about.  Yep.  She looked just like Ron Jeremy.  The hedgehog.  Oh, no.  Yeah, it was.  Right when she went to the fridge and turned around, she was profiled for a little while,  and we were just like, oh, my God, what is going on in there?  What a bod.  All right.  We should take a break. 
[01:26:30]  We got on the way.  Has anyone seen the O'Reilly clip yet?  No.  It was on break.com on the front page over the weekend.  Starkraving lunatic.  You get to see the real O'Reilly.  He's insane.  Lost his mind.  He's insane with people that don't agree with him.  There's something on illegal immigrants and drunk driving.  Some accident.  In Virginia Beach, I guess.  Yeah.  An illegal drunk driving killed an innocent person.  It's a beyond tragic story.  And he has a little standoff on his show with Geraldo, a fellow Fox News guy. 
[01:27:00]  And him and Geraldo get into this match where he just, O'Reilly goes off, and he's just a madman.  The real Bill O'Reilly comes out.  He's waving his finger around and screaming.  Screaming bloody murder.  Why, is stupid Geraldo siding with the illegal immigrant?  Yeah.  But stupid O'Reilly is also trying to, like, make a point.  He's trying to make a...  It's two different issues.  Yeah.  He's trying to drag it into a bigger issue about illegal immigration. 
[01:27:30]  I agreed with him on some points.  Yeah.  But this is more a drunk driving story.  But he's trying to make this the catalyst for talking about illegal immigration.  Yeah.  And that's what Geraldo was calling him out on, going, look, look, this is two different issues.  This is just a drunk driving issue that unfortunately happened.  Well, we can play it now.  We got, like, a couple highlights from the whole thing.  But the clip on break.com, it's, like, 10 minutes long.  It's really interesting. 
[01:28:00]  The buildup and stuff.  And then you just, Geraldo and Bill O'Reilly just going toe-to-toe.  Looked like Geraldo wanted to take a, you know...  A swing at him?  A swing at Mr. O'Reilly.  Maybe in his younger days he would have.  Mr. O'Reilly just, he just looked insane.  My nightmare is my daughter's having anything to do with a drunk.  So this is where Geraldo basically is, he's had, and he's like, he truly thinks this is a drinking issue.  And Bill gets quite upset when he mentions that.  Here it is.  My nightmare is my daughter's having anything to do with a drunk. 
[01:28:30]  Let me finish the answer.  My nightmare is my daughter's having anything to do with a person driving drunk.  That's my nightmare.  It could be a Jewish drunk.  It could be a Polish drunk.  It could be an Irish drunk.  It could be an Italian drunk.  American crime...  What the hell difference does it make?  It makes plenty of difference.  It does not.  He doesn't have a right to be here.  He didn't commit a felony.  He doesn't have a right to be in his country.  What?  But that has nothing to do with the fact that he was a drunk.  He should have been deported.  He should have been deported.  And this mayor and a police chief didn't deport him. 
[01:29:00]  Listen.  Do you know how many people we have in jail?  How many of them are illegal aliens?  Illegal aliens commit crimes at a lower rate than citizens do.  This guy shouldn't have been...  Cool your jets.  That has nothing to do with illegal aliens.  It has to do with drunk driving.  See, the audio doesn't do this justice.  You've got to see how insane Bill O'Reilly looks as he's yelling and screaming at Geraldo.  His face is contorted.  I think we...  They're both right.  Yeah, but they both have a point.  I think we got the clips up on opiananthony.com, the shorter versions, instead of the whole  10-minute clip. 
[01:29:30]  As much as I don't like O'Reilly because I think he is a douche, he makes a good point  about...  You see, Geraldo's making it into, like, well, drunk driving's a tragic thing, and he's  right, but Bill O'Reilly's talking about this one case going, this shouldn't have happened  because they should have thrown this guy out.  This guy should have been out of the country before he did this.  Yeah, drunk driving happens.  That happens in every country with natives and with people who are visiting.  Yeah, Geraldo's saying there's so many drunk driving accidents over the course of a year.  You know, what is this?  It's like, yeah, but this...  I'm talking about this one.  Right.  This would have been one of those tragedies that wouldn't have happened. 
[01:30:00]  Right.  If it was...  If this guy was thrown out of the country.  Well, here is O'Reilly saying Geraldo wants anarchy.  It does.  Don't obscure a tragedy to make a cheap political point.  I'm the father.  It's a cheap political point.  No, it isn't.  And you know it.  This is justice.  This has nothing to do with that poor old mayor.  You want anarchy.  You want...  You want nothing to do with that mayor.  You want anarchy.  No.  You want open-border anarchy.  What I want is fairness.  We have lured these people.  Fairness is full.  We have lured these people.  This is the law.  We have lured these people to this country with a promise of jobs. 
[01:30:30]  In a country where there is basically full domestic employment.  We have for decades lured them here.  And now we're starting a mob scene.  This family is lured no one.  You want your viewers to go knocking on people's door to door.  Are you an illegal?  I want to take you outside and do something to you.  I want the law in force.  History has seen what happens when you sing a lot of people like this.  I want the law in force.  And you don't.  Bill.  Was Geraldo saying that the country is lured illegals here in a way for labor purposes?  Yeah.  Okay, he's right.  That's absolutely right.  Yeah. 
[01:31:00]  And then finally, it ends with O'Reilly giving Geraldo the last word.  Let's calm down.  I'll give you the last word.  A child predator is someone with a predilection to commit an offense against the juvenile.  So you go...  Because of that cause and effect, you go after the person who's perpetrating the offense.  There's no cause and effect between his illegality and his drunkenness.  He's irresponsible.  Latinos aren't more drunk than other people.  The Latino bull, it's about Ramos.  It's not Latinos.  Right.  I agree.  And that's why...  If Ramos was Raminsky, would we care? 
[01:31:30]  We would certainly care.  If he broke the law, he gets 17,000 fatalities drunk drive.  All right.  All right.  What have been...  Oh, it's all apples and oranges to me.  Well...  You should have just agreed to disagree.  There you go.  I think.  It's a very interesting video.  It was a hot video over the weekend on Break.com.  You might want to check out the whole thing for yourself.  But more importantly, what's Yabocam, Iraq?  You can't tease us with Yabocam.  Yabocam. 
[01:32:00]  I'm on our website, and, you know, where it has the Bill O'Reilly-Geraldo, uh, uh, wow,  uh, audio.  Jiminy Cricket.  And I see, like, another video you can check out is Yabocam.  Is she brushing her teeth?  What the hell is Yabocam, Steve?  Everyone should see Yabocam.  They could be the nicest breasts I've ever seen.  Screw Geraldo and O'Reilly.  Do you even know what Yabocam's about?  Opie, those could be the nicest breasts I've ever seen.  That one. 
[01:32:30]  From 2002.  Wow, yeah, that's a five-year-old clip that I completely forgot about.  Well, what is it?  It's pretty self-explanatory.  Obviously, it's a camera under the sink as she's brushing her teeth in just little boy shorts  and massive, uh, massive natural boobs.  I bet she's from Poland.  So she bends over to, like, brush her teeth and spit in the sink, and the camera lens gets  an eye full.  What the hell is Yabocam, though?  Is there a whole series of videos?  I don't think so.  I think that was just something that someone sent me with that header on it, and I said, 
[01:33:00]  and, uh, and I put it up.  And you said, yeah.  And I said, of course.  That was a very, very nice set.  And what about, uh, Eden shakes her 80 double-edged boobs?  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  What's going on here?  Yeah, Eden is this, uh...  He doesn't crapping about, about O'Reilly looking insane.  Eden's got some big boobs.  I can't remember what her website is offhand, but...  Oh, right.  That's...  She looks like Janice.  The monstrosity.  She's in perfect shape, but her boobs make her look like Janice.  Oh, my God.  What are you going to do with those? 
[01:33:30]  Seriously.  What the hell?  What are you going to do?  You're going to dance.  Yeah, that's wonderful, but do you bring that Easter Sunday dinner?  I don't think so.  She's dancing, and they're just flopping.  That's the problem with the big, the big boobed chicks.  You can't bring them to Easter Sunday dinner.  Why not?  And have her sit there, and everyone has to make believe that you're not dating her because  she has massive boobs.  And they're all staring.  Of course they are.  Eden.  All right, Yabocam, though.  Come on. 
[01:34:00]  That's pretty good.  You've got to love Yabocam.  We need more Yabocam.  Oh, they're great.  See, that's manageable.  The 80 double H thing.  Those are nice.  What the hell?  By the way, I want to apologize to anyone whose breasts we may have offended.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Apologize.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was a stupid comment.  I was looking at Yabocam, and, well, they were huge, and, well, I'm sorry.  Yeah. 
[01:34:30]  All right.  When we get back, we're going to either do the Fonzie Henry Winkler PSA from 1984.  We got more lines from that.  Or we could do another, another Zoofile segment.  Well, don't we have a phone call coming?  Oh, yeah, Frank Vincent, probably after the break.  But, you know what, he was in the episode for a minute, so let's just say hi and bye to him today.  Because I think he's going to call.  He's a bigger character.  Yeah, totally.  He's going to call every Monday, supposedly. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, good.  He's a good friend of the show, but, you know, we were excited to have him on today after the season premiere,  thinking that he might have a scene.  He barely had a scene last night.  Yeah.  He should have had more scenes.  And I think Zoofile, women, a particular woman who loves her dog.  From the Zoofile documentary we've been playing.  Not, you know, the normal way where you just kind of feed it and kiss him on his little, little, you know, top of his head. 
[01:35:30]  Little dog nose.  Yeah, little dog nose.  Pet him behind the ear.  But today it's all about Yabokam.  She loves him in the right way.  Right.  Yeah.  Yabokam.  Or Henry Winkler.  You could do that.  Yabokam.  All right.  We'll figure it out after the break.  That's the beauty of us.  We'll have a meeting finally.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe. 
[01:36:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We got to go right to the phones.  Big star on the line.  We got to say hi to Frank Vincent.  Frank.  Oh, I'm cooking.  What's going on, buddy?  Hey, Frank.  How are you guys?  Well, the season premiere of The Sopranos last night, and I got to tell you, Frank, you  were terrific last night. 
[01:36:30]  You love it?  You were just terrific.  You were good.  You were great.  I blinked, but I missed it, but I heard you were good.  When are you going to be in an episode?  Next Sunday, hopefully?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe next Sunday.  Yeah, check it out.  They showed you doing a little drinking with the boys.  Well, you missed it last night?  What were you doing?  Sleeping?  No, we watched it.  No, we saw it.  We watched the whole thing.  We liked the On Golden Pond Sopranos thing. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, it was like On Golden Pond.  You got a real insight into Tony last night and to Bacala.  Your character is the most interesting one, I think.  I think you're the most interesting guy on the show right now.  It's hard for you to agree with, but we think you're the most interesting guy.  Yeah, we need you, Frank.  Well, I think I get more interesting as it goes along.  All right.  I liked how you were there having another one of those great bar parties like you had in Goodfellas.  He just came back.  You know, he was in the hospital, and now Phil came back, and all his boys were all around him. 
[01:37:30]  And he's just saying that he wants to just relax and take me with his grandchildren.  You never know, man.  You know, Phil lies.  Hey, Frank.  Yeah, that's true.  When that guy was kind of breaking your chops a little bit at the party, and you looked annoyed,  and then you kind of like smiled, and you're like, you're ruffled, and like, were you like  just fighting the earth to smack him in the face?  Is that what that was?  Like, you kind of like, all right, I don't want to get upset here?  Yeah, you know who that is, that guy?  Who?  That's Dominic Canisi's son. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, is it?  Yeah, and he said the guy was screwing the lamb, screwing a sheep or something.  Yeah, and then, uh, why do you guys don't do that?  Is your character lightening up a little bit?  Is he what?  Lightening up a little bit, you know, because of your health problems and your hospitalization?  Are you coming back now, your character, and being a little, you know, a bit of a pussy?  Well, I don't know.  We'll see about that.  Next week is going to tell you a lot.  Next week we have a... 
[01:38:30]  Well, I certainly hope so, because this week I learned how to fish, play Monopoly, and sing karaoke.  Come on.  Come on.  We're just...  Frank, we just said it a little while ago.  Well, you know we're big fans of the Sopranos.  We were just a little frustrated because we thought, you know, they would come out of the box really swinging.  I never missed an episode.  I know we saw a fight, and that was awesome.  Absolutely.  I loved the fight.  We just thought there'd be action all over the place to really set up this, the last part of the last season.  Well, they shot the guy in the laundry room. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, in the laundry room.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, and, you know...  And that was Bobby's first kill, by the way.  Yeah, exactly.  They took his cherry.  Why don't you guys do something...  Frank, you want to do something weird?  Like, your character, Phil Ono, like, for no explained reason, your character for the rest of the season should only talk in a French accent.  Now, people would wonder, why is that?  It should never be addressed.  And then the last episode, you never explain it.  Yeah, or you just look into the camera and you go, I'm kidding, I'm not French.  You see, did you like the guy who came up to me and said, tall and tan and young and lovely? 
[01:39:30]  Well, he's a new guy.  He's the guy in contention to be the boss, you know.  Oh, really?  See, I didn't get that.  He's the guy who was running the program while Phil was in the hospital.  Oh, the guy who was kind of, uh, the guy who was saying, ah, you're my favorite turd.  No, no, no.  The guy that came up to Phil and said, tall and tan and young and lovely. 
[01:40:00]  And Phil, when he went away, he said, let me get a drink.  Then he said later on, he said, uh, the guy was up on a gun charge.  Oh.  Yeah.  I don't know if I remember that.  What are you guys looking at?  Called him Porky.  Yeah, we saw that.  I wasn't paying attention.  I thought he was just a background guy.  Yeah.  We weren't paying too close.  We're like, ah, he's just babbling.  Who's he?  I watch you in scenes that you're in.  We, we, we, yeah, exactly.  I watch you.  I'm like, what is Frank going to say here?  We only want you, Frank.  That's right. 
[01:40:30]  I want a show just called Frank.  I just want to hear you talk.  Hey, you have a new book, I understand.  A Guy's Guide to Being a Man's Man.  That's right.  A Guy's Guide to Being a Man's Man.  You can get it at Amazon or Barnes and Noble and other bookstores.  Right.  That's cool, man.  The website.  You can also go to his website.  FrankVincent.com.  Yeah.  I'm going to get your shine box.  Yeah, see?  You get t-shirts like that.  Frank, we're just asking you questions.  Right away, you're getting fresh.  Fresh. 
[01:41:00]  Hey, Frank, what about Janice's body, huh?  You like her?  You would tap that, right?  Um, I can't hear you.  Nice, right?  Yeah, we got this.  You got the lips on her chest.  Man, she walked to the fridge.  Yeah.  She waddled over to the fridge to get some drinks or whatever, and it was like, wow, beach ball with legs.  I'm sure she's very nice, Frank.  Great actress.  She's a wonderful girl.  See, there you go.  She is a great actress, but, you know, but her body is, uh... 
[01:41:30]  Oh.  It's just like, oh, what are you doing to me?  I've got to ask Frank a question.  Yeah, Jimmy's got a question for you.  I'm a tremendous fan.  I loved you so much in Jungle Fever.  Was it kind of fun to yell that out the window?  Jungle Fever?  When you were screaming out the window as your daughter's walking away and the whole neighborhood's coming out, wasn't it kind of fun to yell that out a window?  Everybody in the neighborhood was black.  Yeah.  Would you remember when you were yelling, she's an N lover, you're screaming at her? 
[01:42:00]  Right, right, right.  Wasn't that had to be kind of fun, isn't it?  Is it true that you messed up that line a hundred times because you just wanted to say it as many times as possible?  Right.  Spike kept saying to me, what are you doing?  Let's do it one more time.  Right.  Spike kept saying it's not even in the script.  Right.  You're supposed to say, you're late, you're late.  You guys are whacked out.  You're nuts.  Yeah.  Well, it's Monday, Frank.  You know the deal.  A little tired today.  Are you on the set?  Yeah, I'm still on the set now.  I'm shooting, yeah. 
[01:42:30]  Doing some reshoots, huh?  Yeah, we're doing some pickups, exactly.  Very, very cool.  Now, Frank, promise us that you're going to get into some action this season.  I'll give you my word of honor.  You're our boy.  We want to see Frank Vincent messing things up here.  We'll be coming on the show live, too, maybe in a week or so.  Oh, nice.  Nice to have you, Frank.  Want to see some violence.  All right.  Hey, guys.  All right, have a good week.  We'll definitely talk to you next week.  All right, Frank.  Thanks for having me, guys.  Thank you, Frank.  Bye, buddy.  Bye-bye.  Frank Vincent, everyone, on the set of The Sopranos. 
[01:43:00]  I just called him buddy.  Like, if he saw my face, he'd recognize me.  Hey there, pal.  Just a second.  I knew we were going to talk to him today.  I was all excited.  And then I watched the episode last night.  I was like, hey, where's Frank?  He was in one scene doing some drinking with the boys.  Doing some drinking.  Not really even drinking.  At another lousy party at a bar.  Yeah.  It was so funny.  He's at the corner of the bar, like in Goodfellas.  My party.  My party.  It's just the greatest.  We got to squeeze in some more Imus.  I mean, everyone's talking about it.  And Imus is just, he's continuing his all-day apology.  His all-day apology. 
[01:43:30]  My apology tour.  Guys, there's so many good things for kids.  Just let it go.  I think this week they're doing a huge thing for kids.  Wait.  Another punchline.  Yeah.  Yeah.  AfroTurf.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stupid.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that.  No, it's okay if you just do the punchlines.  I think that's safe.  I think that's safe territory to me.  Yeah.  Okay.  I already did the, oh, and then stick them to the wall. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  That's a good one.  Oh, shut up.  All right.  Well, Imus says his show makes fun of everyone.  God.  Yeah.  I think we've said that a few times in the past.  Yeah, we certainly have.  Then the Rutgers girls didn't deserve to be made fun of.  Oh, my God.  Why not, Imus?  Oh, Don.  Can I see a picture of the Rutgers girls? 
[01:44:30]  Oh, Don.  Could you, uh, E-Rock, stat, pop up their, uh, publicity shot?  The Rutgers female basketball team.  I want to see what they look like.  They call them nappy, what, nappy-headed hoes?  Nappy-headed hoes.  Nappy-headed hoes.  So said in jest.  So said to be silly.  There's anyone who's offended by that.  Nowhere near.  There's no justification.  Nowhere is near hate speech.  Yeah.  All right.  Let me, uh, look at that picture.  Hold on.  Well, half the team seems to be white to begin with as I see the team picture. 
[01:45:00]  One, two, three, four, five.  Holy Jesus, yeah.  Yeah, there's some...  All right.  Well, you know what?  Let, uh, Mr. Imus get in trouble.  They're big girls.  They're awful.  They're all big girls.  And then, this one and this one kind of look like guys.  And then this one.  And the, the, believe me, the white ones are no prize either.  Is that a woman?  Which one?  The one all the way to the left in the pink shirt. 
[01:45:30]  That's Steve.  Wow.  I don't know.  Is that a woman or a man?  Stop it.  Stop it.  I have no idea.  It's one of those in-betweens.  And that?  Okay, there's a man.  Where?  The one wearing the tie.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  That's pretty obvious.  What about the one next to the man in the tie?  Yeah, I don't know what that is.  The Stalker Patty looking person.  I think that's.  That could be a guy too, though.  Wow.  All right.  Well, there he is.  Man, ew.  God bless you.  Ew.  I didn't sneeze on the mic. 
[01:46:00]  He sneezed into the car.  Yeah, there's only one, two, three, four, five, six black girls on this.  So, I say he should apologize for being inaccurate.  That's right.  Well, I think the black girls are the ones that start because, you know,  everyone knows that black people are better at basketball than white people.  Here's the thing.  Is this a proven fact or what?  They should make them dress sexy.  Female basketball players should have to wear, like, little pasties and G-strings,  and they should have to have their nails done and just play like girls. 
[01:46:30]  Stop being with your big calves and your high socks.  No one wants to see that.  Where they have to kick their right leg backwards as they shoot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They shoot with both underhand, both hands.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Here's Iman.  Yeah, he's just continuing all morning, man.  It's very depressing to hear the Iman have to go down this road.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Because I, he's a little scared.  Start crying?  He's a little scared today.  Scared.  But I don't, I don't think this is Iman's talking.  I think, I don't know, they're using his body. 
[01:47:00]  I think you know who's using his body.  The big guys upstairs.  This program has been for 30 or 35 years a program that makes fun of everybody.  It makes fun of me and it makes fun of everybody on the planet.  And sometimes it makes fun of me to a vicious standpoint.  Does that mean I get to say something about the Rutgers women?  Of course not.  But that's the context in which we operate here.  Is it appropriate? 
[01:47:30]  Well, we'll talk about that a little later because that's got to change some of that.  Because some people don't deserve to be made fun of.  Like these young women who played for the national championship at basketball.  They played for the national championship.  They beat Duke.  They don't need me to try to be funny about them.  But they don't know why.  What are you doing?  Why is he going overboard with this?  Imus, what are you, did he get death threats?  Oh my God.  Did he get death threats?  That is not Imus.  That is not Imus.  Who is that?  What?  Oh my.  They don't deserve to be made fun of. 
[01:48:00]  Why not?  If you make fun of everyone and everything and you see a little visual that makes you think  of something, you're going to say it.  Yeah.  Gives a crap if they're good students and all that other junk.  If they all cured cancer.  You're doing a morning radio show where you're trying to make people laugh.  If they all cured cancer, that's one thing.  But they tried to prove that they could throw a ball in a hole better than a bunch of other  women could throw a ball in a hole.  Yeah, that's it.  It's nothing.  Wow.  You don't have to worry about it.  Why are they so off limits?  Yeah.  Jesus.  They're cosmonauts.  Look, look. 
[01:48:30]  I'm sorry.  They're women basketball players and I shouldn't have made fun of them.  Okay, let's do the retard bit.  Right, exactly.  Exactly.  Are we going to be hearing a new Imus now from now on?  Has he entered another phase of his career where it's politically correct Imus?  Today's show was sponsored by Popeyes.  He's aft.  He's aft.  You can't make fun of anything now, Mr. Imus.  No.  Well, I got another punchline.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because it's white and it works. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  See?  You stay with the punchlines.  It's very safe, Mr. Imus.  Yeah.  Hey, maybe we should just throw the rest of the audio clips away.  No one wants to hear Imus like this, right?  Oh, no, I kind of do.  Oh, come on.  It's torture.  It really is torture to listen to Imus doing this.  But why is he going so overboard?  Because he's obviously getting a lot of pressure from corporate, probably from, I don't know,  maybe like Jimmy was hinting to, maybe some death threats or some kind of crazy pressure 
[01:49:30]  that's getting to him.  The pressure is getting to him.  You know what this is like?  This is like overhearing your dad in a room.  Like you walk by and he's on the phone and you hear him going, look, my family's going  to bed.  Just pull your car up.  I'll hop in.  I'll suck it.  Drop it off.  That's how uncomfortable slap hot this is.  Yeah, this is a side of Imus I have not heard.  I have not heard.  And we've been monitoring him all morning. 
[01:50:00]  He's now like, he's wearing like glasses.  He just took them off.  But he's putting on his glasses.  He doesn't have his cowboy hat on today.  Are they all somber today?  Yeah.  Are they in a somber mood?  Oh, yeah.  We're playing the clips.  This just went on.  Imus says one of the reverends told him all black people believe white people don't  like them.  Oh, my God.  And he said, you know, at the core of every black person, I said, you have to understand  this. 
[01:50:30]  They believe that white people don't like them.  And they believe that no matter how good a white person is, that at some point it comes  out like it came out with you.  And that just confirms what they think.  How about.  And if you'll say this, what will they say?  How about that?  I believe because he could say that.  How about here's my experience.  I believe in every black person. 
[01:51:00]  They don't like white people.  I mean, why not?  That guy just made a blanket statement like that.  He just.  Imus just told us that a black guy told Imus that he believes that that black people, all  black people believe that white people don't like them.  Well, all white people believe that black people don't like them.  There you go.  I just made a blanket statement.  I just spoke for every white person, just like that guy did.  Did I must turn around and call him an idiot? 
[01:51:30]  He should have.  Jesus Christ.  Come on.  Well, the Reverend may have even had a weird point.  Not that all black people, but black people as a group say may think that white people  don't like him.  But then Imus's response to him.  Well, why should that affect what I do in humor?  Because a group of people are ill-informed.  So what.  Yeah, there you go.  So what you're doing, sir, is lumping all white people into one category and basing your  opinion on all white people because of the actions of a few. 
[01:52:00]  Wow.  Never heard that happen before.  What a bunch of effing hypocrites.  Well, stop it already.  We better just throw these away.  No.  No, I want to hear more.  No, no.  I can't do it to the man.  I am tired of humor being affected because of the sins of people from 1960-something and  before.  I'm tired of humor being affected by that.  Because of the disgusting way they behaved, I can't make certain jokes or Imus can't make  certain jokes. 
[01:52:30]  It's ridiculous.  There's no balance.  It's just nonsense.  Uh, because it could be your car.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't want to apologize.  You want to hear another clip?  Yes.  All right.  Imus explains his cancer ranch has 10% black kids.  He's going all out.  We have a ranch in New Mexico for kids with cancer and blood disorders and so on. 
[01:53:00]  And half, nearly half of the kids who come there are from the north.  This sounds like Ricky Gervais in the last episode of The Office, begging for his job.  He's basically begging for his job and pointing out everything he's done.  So look at all the stuff I've done before you make your decision.  I don't want to be redundant.  The fact that he has to apologize after having done so much charity work.  And meanwhile, that scumbag, Sharpton, what did he do besides stand on 125th Street and  call some white people interlopers and get their store burned down? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  What has he ever done charitable?  Nothing.  Besides allegedly stealing from a charity.  That was a big allegation.  Of course.  I don't know if it was true.  What has he ever done?  Those allegations, he doesn't do anything.  As far as I know, he chases around victims of the NYPD that he calls them, you know, victims  of the NYPD and runs around to minority families.  And is there representative scumbag so he can get his face on the news?  Right.  We have a ranch in New Mexico for kids with cancer and blood disorders and so on. 
[01:54:00]  And half, nearly half of the kids who come there are from minority groups.  Ten percent of the kids who come to our ranch are African-Americans.  It's not.  I'm not a white man who doesn't know any African-Americans.  And my wife and I, Deidre, we run this ranch.  We don't have counselors.  The whole basis of this ranch is these parents from all over this country and all over the  world, they send their children to this ranch because they know that my wife and I are going 
[01:54:30]  to be their parents for ten days.  They live in the house with us.  There's not an African-American parent on the planet who has sent their child to the  Imus ranch who didn't trust me and trust my wife.  If Imus ends up crying this morning, it's the end of radio as we know.  It's like we should just pack our bags and just say, you know what, let's go do something 
[01:55:00]  else.  What is he doing?  I'm hoping that this is because all he did was make a joke.  I'm hoping that maybe he's reacting this way because maybe someone said something to  him.  Like, I personally think that somebody said something to Chappelle, which freaks him out.  That's my opinion on it.  I think somebody said something to him and he had like a weird revelation, whether he  was right or wrong.  And I'm kind of hoping that's what happened to Imus.  Like, like, like all of a sudden he's looking at things differently because of something  someone said to him as opposed to pressure.  Oh, boy. 
[01:55:30]  You know, I, uh, I had a dream last night that, um, I was walking down the beach and,  uh, there were, uh, two sets of footprints.  Yeah.  And, um, you know, represented my life.  And, uh, during the hardest parts of my life, uh, there were only one, uh, set of footprints.  And the other set belonged to, um, uh, Jesus.  And, uh, I said, uh, Jesus, why during the, uh, hardest parts of my life were, uh, uh,  only one set of footprints, you know, you, uh, leave me alone. 
[01:56:00]  You know, that's stupid.  And Jesus said, that's when I got a black guy to carry you.  Not how that goes.  No.  Got a jerk.  There's only, oh, my God.  There were a lot of, a lot of, uh, parts of my life.  There was two sets of footprints.  And then sometimes, right before I had laid bloodied, there was two sets and a pair of  sneaker prints running up and running away. 
[01:56:30]  I just woke up next to a brick.  All right, look.  The last clip is too much.  Oh, boy.  Can we just...  Oh, no, no.  We got to play it.  Are you sure?  This is changing the face of radio as we know it.  All right, this is this close to crying this morning.  This is 35 years this career has spanned, where I've never, ever heard Imus even speak  like this.  Like he said, they have goofed on every bot in 35 years.  There is not one person that hasn't been goofed on by Don Imus. 
[01:57:00]  But he can't goof on the blacks because they're the weaker species.  That's what their leaders are telling them.  That's what their leaders are really telling them by doing this, by overreacting to everything.  I guess they can't handle a joke or something.  I don't know.  I don't get it on any level.  Man, is he going overboard with this apology?  It was a little nappy-headed hose joke.  It wasn't even done to be hurtful or awful.  No.  All right, here we go.  White people suck.  You know what?  It was a throwaway line.  I hate whitey. 
[01:57:30]  Here we go.  I hate whitey.  Here we go.  Do you want to know what people called me for supporting Harold Ford Jr.?  Do you want to know the male I got to call me an in-lover?  And do you want to know what people said to me for the years that I've played Bishop Patterson sermons?  People tell me they didn't want to hear that.  What are you going to match?  Do you want to know what people said to me when I booked the Blind Boys of Alabama here years ago,  and they've been on fairly regularly ever since then? 
[01:58:00]  Glad I miscount my letters.  What they said about them and about me having, about all of the African-American musicians over the years  who I've had on this program and so on.  Does that mean that it's okay for me to say what I said about these Russian women?  I hope you don't think that, because I don't think that.  Oh, my God.  You don't need to do a mea culpa.  I know.  You're not a racist.  You're not.  You didn't do anything wrong.  Jesus.  David Duke didn't apologize this much when he was running for options. 
[01:58:30]  People with burning crosses in their hands just say they're sorry and walk away.  I miss you.  You didn't do anything.  Yeah, you didn't do anything wrong enough.  You know, even if he interprets it in his head and wants to, you know,  it's up to him how he wants to view this and apologize for it.  But no matter how you're seeing this in your own head and from the feedback you're getting,  this is much too much of an apology for what you did.  This is overkill. 
[01:59:00]  Like, we've all said things.  Like, again, not from pressure from anybody.  But when you look back, I've said things where I look back, I go,  ugh, I kind of like to go back and go, look, I was kidding when I said it.  Because you kind of feel like a dick.  Like, all right, that happens.  And if you want to do that because you feel a little bad about it, it was a little whatever.  Tell me about it.  I'd like to go back 15 minutes myself.  The Frank Vincent call?  Okay.  The Frank Vincent call?  No.  It's just that I'm always saying awful things.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You have to apologize to the office, not even the radio world. 
[01:59:30]  Hey, turn the TV off then, for God's sake.  What can I say?  I think there were tears in his eyes.  Tears in his eyes, I guess, as he lines up for this last apology.  Don Imus.  On the air.  Oh, that's a good one.  He's apologizing to black reverends.  Okay.  He lines up this shot.  He's probably going to use a, I'm sorry, you know a lot of black people.  There he goes.  Oh, that's a good one.  They're buying it. 
[02:00:00]  They're buying his apology.  I'm a wreck.  It's an apology.  Come on, Imus.  It'll be great.  It's a sad day for radio, man.  We got Imus practically crying on his show today.  If he was proving that he's like a really like, you know, equal opportunity guy, if  he said that he wants to approach the black guy and shook his hand and pointed at a Puerto  Rican and said, I'd rather have you in my neighborhood than him.  Let's get out of there for a bit.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:00:30]  I know the virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Come on.  Come on.  Um, want to hear a joke?  Uh, yes, Mr. Ryan.  I can't tell the whole thing because I'm kind of in trouble.  Uh, Batman can go out at night without Robin. 
[02:01:00]  So you're playing it safe.  You're just doing the punchlines.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, no trouble in that.  I freed the what?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's one of my, I want to apologize if I've offended anybody.  All right.  Can I, I, I, sometimes the I miss people, uh, pick up moments of this show.  Can I offer an open, why don't you just have our pal, Patrice O'Neal, come in your studio 
[02:01:30]  and sit there with you and goof around about this and you will get an honest perspective  from a black guy who is not trying to make white people feel guilty and.  Doesn't have an agenda.  Uh, it's the, the angle Patrice took on Hannity, which was such a great angle about who cares  about Michael Richards.  You don't make this idiot anything more than he is.  He's a nobody is, uh, it's an angle.  A lot of people aren't comfortable with because it diffuses things.  And, you know, Patrice O'Neal can speak better for the black man than Reverend Al Sharpton  can.  Absolutely. 
[02:02:00]  Well, he's as simple as that.  It's as simple as that.  Why doesn't that, that's a guy you have on because he would, he would buy, he would  a berate Imus and B because he is a dick and he would do it so funny that he would  just make you see what an ass everybody is.  How stupid this is.  Who cares?  Hey, um.  Yep.  Could we squeeze in a dog lover before we get out of here?  Why wouldn't we?  We, uh, we found this documentary.  It's the zoo file documentary and, uh, we've been playing some clips, uh, the last few days.  Not like the zoo file. 
[02:02:30]  You know, it's, uh, being a zoo file.  P-H.  Yeah, P-H-I-L-E.  That's, uh, people that, uh, love animals.  Love animals.  And they love them a little more than you and I.  Mm-hmm.  So, um, we have a woman that kind of likes her dog.  Kind of likes her dog.  A lot.  A lot.  In a special way.  You think she's good looking?  No.  They're never good looking now, are they?  Mm-mm.  Maybe we shouldn't say that.  We'll piss off the, uh, animal, the dog lovers out there. 
[02:03:00]  Uh, now we got Patrice on the line.  See, here, everyone is getting an expert on the line today.  We got our expert, Patrice.  Hello?  What's up, Patrice?  Patrice O'Neal, everyone.  How you doing?  Hi, Dal.  Good, Patrice.  Have you heard about the, uh, Don Imus situation?  Yeah, a few days ago I was, um, I listened to that, that statement.  Again, I was, I couldn't believe he apologized.  I, I, you don't understand how funny that was to say Jigaboo and wannabe from school days. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  That was a, that was a Spike Lee, uh, that was, and if you watch the game, I was thinking the same thing, that the Rutgers girls are the worst group of girls.  You know, they, they, they, they, they bother you when you look at them.  Bother you.  See?  And I'm gonna tell you, anybody, any black person, man, who says that that wasn't funny, we, it's like, look at, this is what we do, we have to. 
[02:04:00]  It's almost like the Michael Jackson situation.  Yeah.  Or even the OJ thing sometimes, is that we have to disagree with y'all.  That's just the rule.  We cannot, like, we gotta be mad.  When y'all are in a corner, and white people are in a corner, we gotta just keep you there, just for historical, uh, measures.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  But the girls from Tennessee were better to look at.  Candace Parker is a cute little thing.  And the, the center for Rutgers look like a, look like me. 
[02:04:30]  Like, that's what it looked like, she looked like looking at me.  With long hair.  With.  Longer hair.  With a girl.  With tattoos.  Yeah, with the tattoos.  Now, now, Ima said nappy-headed hoe.  Did that bother you, Patrice?  You know what it is?  I guess it's because black people are, we should, we supposed to have the, I guess we have the right to say those type of things.  I would say that all day long.  I mean, that's, that's what we would say. 
[02:05:00]  And, and to be hilarious, what makes it hilarious, black people don't say nappy-headed anything anymore.  Like, we, we got out the thing of saying good hair, bad hair, and all that.  That says Don Imus is a little bit, uh, detached from time.  But that also says that this dude is attached a little bit to blackness.  You should almost laugh when an old white man knows how to say nappy-headed hoe.  Out of, I'm joking.  You know what I'm saying? 
[02:05:30]  It was just, it really wasn't, I mean, look, I'm losing the black point.  Just because I'm, it's, it was funny to me.  It was funny.  It was a School Days reference.  Yeah.  He was watching School Days.  Spike Lee should be proud that he was commenting from that.  That's Spike Lee!  And it was the first thing away from hate speech, because they're bringing that into this.  It's like, it was so obvious.  It was, it was done in jest.  It was a throwaway line.  He was looking for a quick laugh, because we all saw the visual of, of the Rutgers girls, uh, team there. 
[02:06:00]  And they looked a bit scary on the court.  And that's what he came up with on the spot.  He said, you're just a jiggaboo.  It's a song!  Well, do you think that, like, did somebody get to him, like, he's, he's so over the top apologizing, like, so far beyond.  I mean, it's not like they overheard him dropping an N-bomb in anger.  He, he was being silly.  Like, why is he groveling?  Like, did somebody from the black community say something that hit him in his soul?  Yeah, whoever he works with.  Whoever works for him.  That's what we say. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, his boss threatening him.  Oh, his boss, okay.  Yeah, these are not Imus's words.  No, I mean.  In my opinion.  I've never seen someone apologize so much for something.  The guy, it's a, it's a four-hour apology fest.  Even the Germans just waved at the Jews and said, all right, our band, move on.  Sorry.  I mean, he, he, he, he, he's, the apology, you gotta understand, the apology is the thing that's getting, getting y'all in trouble.  Like, you, you have to, like, you know who you don't hear about anymore? 
[02:07:00]  Ann Coulter.  Yeah.  She said, ah, shit, that tag is used for something this, that, and the third.  And then they were like, you know what, Ann is not gonna apologize.  She's not apologizing, so we gotta back off, because this is useless.  When they, when any group sees somebody apologizing, they don't pull back, they start going forward and going, yeah, you apologize?  Well, how about this?  Now apologize for this.  And, I, I, it's not sincere enough.  Or the, you just gotta turn around and say, shut up. 
[02:07:30]  People, they're not gonna use, people aren't gonna use the humanity factor, where you think, all right, I'm apologizing.  People go, okay, he's, it's jailhouse tactics, man.  You, if you, if you take something from somebody, and, and, you owe them.  So, that, that apology, you keep owing them.  They know you're on flinch now.  Yep.  You, he should have said, look, man, school day, he should have said, that was hilarious.  I know I'm not supposed to say it, because I'm white.  But, no one black was saying it, so I had to say it, because it was too funny not to say it. 
[02:08:00]  Matter of fact, I was like, you know what, call me.  Anytime you want to say a funny line like that, I'll say it.  Yeah, it's, uh, keep us out of trouble.  You know, this all went down on Friday, and Patrice was in.  We, we really thought this was a throwaway story.  Like, ah, got in a little trouble, but, uh, whatever.  He'll probably have to apologize and move on.  But it's, it's, it's picking up steam.  Every news channel this morning is getting their expert on to say why it's wrong. 
[02:08:30]  You know, Patrice, imagine if they would have seen what we did on XM on Friday.  Yeah, you had, I was just thinking, I was going home going, this is, that was the most hilarious.  Like, we would get mad.  And then it's like, I'm going, geez, when she goes, she goes, oh, please, um, I'm sorry for doing that to the field.  It was slave role playing.  Yeah.  All right, so you had no problem with us playing Slave Girl on Friday, right?  But I, I think you already established that y'all are a bunch of racists. 
[02:09:00]  But here's the thing.  Here's what I try to have credibility on.  I try to be half down the road.  If it's, if it's touchy with me, I will say, oh, that's terrible.  Yeah.  But if it's not, I try to at least be fair to the racial fun.  You know what I'm saying?  Because I know what I say.  I can't tell white people not to say some racial stuff.  All right, look.  It's not fair.  All right, look.  I'm looking at a picture of Danny with a paddle with a beautiful, beautiful black girl bent over with just her panties showing. 
[02:09:30]  A striped little panties.  Maybe, maybe we should get rid of this picture before the, uh, the press gets a hold of it.  Because that's, I don't know how we're going to explain it.  And yeah, the caption says, Slave Girl, uh, April 6, 2007.  Is that on our website?  Oh, it didn't happen.  Oh, great.  Oh, that was a long time ago.  It's dated, idiots.  Oh, well.  When?  Uh, last Friday.  Oh, please.  I'm just hoping there's a picture of that same scenario with Patrice in the picture. 
[02:10:00]  So maybe that'll save our asses.  I don't think so.  Danny's done.  Yeah, we'll fire Danny in a second to save our asses.  No problem.  It was some of the stuff, man.  It's a, it's a, we do not, black, 2007, man, we do not have the same.  Black people are not, we're not in 1950 and we're not going back.  No.  So it's like some of the things, man, we can laugh at and they have no power to them  at all, but it's like a rule that we have to be mad every time somebody white says something. 
[02:10:30]  It's, some of that stuff is, I want to say something back to Imus, but funny.  Not like, you should lose your job because you shouldn't have said that, Don.  You shouldn't have said Jigga Boy I want to be.  If there was no reference point that Spike said it and black people actually, we feel that  ready, I was looking at the Rutgers game.  The Rutgers girls are tough to look at. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Hey, we're going to try to get you on Patrice's, on Imus' show, Patrice.  I think you could use the help.  You've got a good perspective on these things.  We loved what you did with Sean Hannity with the whole Michael Richards thing.  It's like, my thing with Sean Hannity was, stop, we're out, but I, look, I am not, I  don't care what every, all the black leaders who, black people actually didn't vote for.  We, we don't vote for our black leaders.  They're appointed by white people to who they hate the most. 
[02:11:30]  We don't have a black leader that white people liked.  Yeah.  That's why Barack Obama, you don't hear him saying he's a black leader.  Obama!  Yeah, he's not saying he's a black leader because white, white people like him.  But it's not, he's not a black leader, but he's black.  But white people don't dislike him.  That's why he's not our leader.  Yep.  Colin Powell.  Yeah.  Same thing.  Didn't like him.  But Sean Hannity, I'm not taking, I'm not taking him as my, my Jesus Christ for 
[02:12:00]  racism, Michael Richards.  I'm not going to take him as, I'm going to get four or five credible blacks that you  can raise, and I'm not going to raise mine for Michael Richards.  All right, Patrice, we got to go.  We're running out of time.  Thank you, sir.  You called me last night.  Was it important?  Oh, just to say, Groundhouse stunk.  Okay.  I like Groundhouse.  We'll have to talk about that maybe on XM or tomorrow.  Thanks, Patrice.  Bye, Doc.  All right.  By the way, in all fairness, we did have a lot of black people, you know, calling and 
[02:12:30]  talking about this today, and it was a shutout.  Yeah.  It was a shutout.  All the black people that called our show today said, ain't no thing.  They said, ain't no thing on this one.  No big deal.  Mr. Ives, the final word to you.  Yes.  Uh, your mom's box.  Good luck, bro.  Good luck, bro.  Good luck, bro.  No.  Good luck, bro.  No.  See you over at XM.  If not, eh.  Oh, what, Jimmy?  What?  We were done.  It was a perfect ending. 
[02:13:00]  What do you want?  Well, after us, only for those of you in New York, JV and Elvis come on, but from noon  to three, after JV and Elvis is Nick DiPaolo.  And if you happen to have the radio on, I'd love to hear his take on this.  Oh, yeah.  It ain't going to be pretty.  Oh, he'll be good today.  He'll be very good today.  And the fatso thing.  We'll help you out tomorrow, all right?  We got to go.  Even our music is fading out now.  Bye.  Bye.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We'll be right back. 
[02:13:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:14:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:14:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:15:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:15:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:16:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:16:30]  On the season finale and on one other, it ends like a minute before the episode ends. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, my God.  The tape cuts off.  Oh, that's never good.  And even though in the season finale for The Wire, they always play a song and they have  like a montage.  It's really well done.  Monsters.  Montage.  So, could you send me the last four episodes on disc, because the last minute cuts off on  disc, because the last minute cuts off on them, and I was just...  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's funny.  Livid.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's funny.  Livid.  Justin from Pittsburgh, after listening to the walkover hiatus best of, I'm demanding  a reunion between Opie and his old friend, Black Gary.  This would be a gem.  Yep.  Well, you go try to find what prison he's in. 
[02:17:30]  I don't know.  I don't have time to do that.  How about that?  You're going to talk like that.  You're going to be apologizing.  True.  That's right.  Like Mr. Amos.  See, he should have used a character when he did that.  Should have used a character.  He broke his own rule.  He used to use characters.  Character.  Sid.  Sid was his character.  Yes, Sid.  Sid was the one that would say all that outrageous shit.  Say all the stupid stuff and get in trouble for it.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's go to Steve in Kentucky.  Steve, what's going on?  How are you today?  It is Steve.  I hope he had the right suggestion. 
[02:18:00]  Hey, what's going on?  What was that?  Hold on, Steve.  Fire Rob Bartlett.  Make a statement.  We want Bartlett fired.  And we want him to go, but what did I do?  And the bosses look at him and go, oh, you know what you did.  That's right.  You know.  Beat it racist.  And that's all I give him.  Steve, Kentucky, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, uh, Opie.  I've been taking your advice.  You know, when the show gets to drag it a little bit, I'll flip the channel, listen  to something else, bounce back and forth.  Fuck, we didn't mean that, by the way.  We want you to sit through the horse shit, too. 
[02:18:30]  Just say it.  We don't mean it.  We don't mean it.  You guys tell people, you know, you don't like it, go somewhere else.  Well, I too did.  I listened to the replay Friday afternoon.  And I tell you what, best show y'all have done in the three years I've been listening  to you.  You like this?  Absolutely outstanding.  What do you like, though?  Slave Girl?  Yeah, yeah.  And you know what?  Even if it would have been Patrice hitting a white girl, just the way you guys narrated  and described what was going on, you know, the guys that don't have pal talk or a computer 
[02:19:00]  or whatever were out here on the road.  It was just fantastic.  And you know what the best part of the whole deal was?  Little Jimmy Norton wasn't there to screw it up, just like he did at the end of the  FM show a few minutes ago.  Oh, boy.  Sir, how did they screw it up?  What happened, Steve?  How did Jimmy screw up the FM show?  Oh, you guys had a great finish.  Your mom's box.  Good luck, bro.  And then Jimmy's got to break in with, oh, somebody send me some CDs.  Or listen to the show.  Wait, what? 
[02:19:30]  No, no, no.  Dude, hold on.  Hold on.  The show's great.  Jimmy, Jimmy, go on the road.  Hold on a minute, stupid.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Hold on a minute, sir.  Steve, that was set on the XM side.  And the thing I said at the end of the show was that they should listen to Nick DiPaolo  because the better that station does, the better it is for us there.  So that was, and a guy who I happen to like.  Nothing but dribble.  All right.  Well, go fuck yourself.  Oh, boy.  All right, Steve.  That was the Jimmy bit we do for the entire time.  That was hurtful.  Yeah, that's kind of hurtful.  Why don't you say something positive to me? 
[02:20:00]  Leave him on.  I don't like you, Jimmy.  You've made some comments in the past that I don't like.  Okay, no, no.  No, I'm not going to discuss it with you because I'm going to give you the opportunity.  Guys, great show.  Listen to you when Jimmy's gone.  He's going to chicken shit out on you.  Of course he does.  He's a cunt.  I'm not going to discuss it with you because that would give you an opportunity.  I said some comments.  What's the matter?  Are you married to a fat pig?  I'll bet you that's what it is.  I'll bet you he has to go home and fuck a big fat pig and he doesn't like that I rail  on fatties.  And you said, yeah, you said something about fatties he didn't like.  Hit too close to home, so you're an asshole. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, fuck him.  Stupid accent.  But I like the fact that he tunes the show out when I'm on.  So if you did that, why'd you call it I'm here, stupid?  Yeah, you shouldn't have known.  All right.  All right.  Hopefully he'll wind up in a ditch, paralyzed.  Justin from Philly.  Feeling a dream.  He's a miserable Flyers fan and he just wants to congratulate me on the stupid Islanders.  And that's how he wrote it.  Congratulations on your stupid Islanders.  Flyers, worst team in hockey this year.  Let's just acknowledge that.  They pulled their miracle.  All right. 
[02:21:00]  Slave girl, Jimmy.  I missed that.  Slave girl.  We just have the clips.  The video.  Is there a video actually up on opianthony.com?  Are we that insane?  Hope not.  Are we that insane to have a video?  It's on YouTube.  It's what?  We were, uh, insensitive and, uh, shouldn't have done slave girl. 
[02:21:30]  Who's that old broad?  Be nice.  There's a...  What, Sam?  There's no video yet.  Oh, okay.  A young lad with her.  Ooh.  What are they doing?  I don't know.  They're just here to fucking watch a stupid radio show.  Paperwork.  What are you guys doing out there?  It's like Lin Samuel's road team.  That's right.  What are they doing?  Why are they doing paperwork?  It's a dumb radio show where we tell a bunch of dick jokes. 
[02:22:00]  Well, okay.  I can understand if it's a quick, uh, read this statement and sign.  But there's, like, pages.  Occasionally you make a comment I don't like.  God dang it.  There's pages.  They got a show ID.  More importantly, is my smoothie on the way?  And my sandwich.  I don't remember Kenny asking.  Kenny's usually very good with that.  And now, um, may have to be reprimanded.  Hey.  Can you bring me a copy of what they have to fill out?  Just a clean copy?  Excuse me, ma'am?  Yeah.  What are you, what are you reading? 
[02:22:30]  Paperwork.  Just to be here.  Just to be here.  Holy crap.  Who started this?  I know we've had it from the...  And how can a kid sign a contract?  I don't think he's allowed.  How many pages is this?  Uh, six or eight.  You're not kidding?  No, I am kidding.  How many pages, really?  Just one.  Oh.  No, there's a couple.  Because this guy's showing the same thing.  Two.  I ignored the second page.  And you got to, like, show ID and all that.  Yeah. 
[02:23:00]  Was your cavity searched?  That'll hurt.  Not me.  Not you?  All right.  This is not, this is fine.  It's not much.  It's not much?  What's all that stuff?  Honestly, it's just your name, address.  It just kind of gives XM the right to broadcast you if we're talking to them or whatever.  And, uh, and the next page is just a copy of the driver's license.  It's really not understandable.  Disclaimer.  How about a sign?  You're on, on mic at all times.  Yeah, on air.  When you enter this building.  Don't complain.  All right, whatever.  Or beat it.  Hey, uh, so Slave Girl, the video, can we throw the video up? 
[02:23:30]  Thumbs up.  Let's wait till, uh, I miss, uh, thing goes away.  We played Slave Girl.  I want to hear the, uh.  On Friday, Jimmy.  And I was talking to Anthony at FH Riley's.  Yep.  400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village.  Had a good time.  We had a good time Saturday.  Speaking of which, did you like Art of the Topless?  Oh, yeah.  They did a great job.  I gotta be honest, I was very skeptical when, uh, when Fat Opie, a.k.a. Patrick, said that  he was, uh, getting this band together to do, uh, songs of the Opie and Anthony slash Ron 
[02:24:00]  and Fez show.  I was like, wow, this is gonna be just a disaster of epic proportions to the point where we barely  promoted it.  We mentioned it twice.  Yeah, a couple of times.  And I thought I was doing Art of the Topless a favor.  I'm figuring this isn't gonna be that good.  And, uh, why, why have a lot of people, uh, watch a disaster.  Ron and Fez pushed it, put him over.  They show up at FH Riley's.  I, I actually enjoyed their song, Check, Check, Check, Check.  That, I think that was the song they did at midnight. 
[02:24:30]  Check, check, check, check.  Thank God I didn't show up when they said they were going on.  My brother was losing his mind.  It's midnight.  They're still setting up.  They, they came up, they came, uh, with enough equipment to play Madison Square Garden.  It's, it's FH Riley's.  My brother said they were, they were, um, they were, they were setting up towers of speakers  that were just, like, wobbly.  And my brother's like, what are you doing?  This place holds 150 people tops.  Told them to take their, their wall of sound down and, and get the damn show on the road. 
[02:25:00]  And at midnight, you heard Check, Check, Check, Check.  And Ronnie and I looked at each other like, oh boy.  Uh, it's the Check, Check song.  But then, they got it together.  It was their first gig as Art of the Topless and, uh, uh, rave reviews by everyone.  They kicked ass.  It's all the music from the show, Jimmy.  Everything from the Black Girl song to Patty singing White Rabbit instead of doing the karaoke version.  Oh, she does that, yeah.  They start with, uh, Ecstasy of Gold.  They go into their own version of Little Rage Against the Machine. 
[02:25:30]  All of a sudden, they play a little Sabbath because they know you like Sabbath.  It was a nice mixture of songs that, uh, you know and love from the Opie and Anthony Slash Ron and Fez show.  And they're on to something.  So, I'm, I'm thinking that, uh, they should do it live a week from Friday right here at XM where we can really.  That'd be cool.  Where we can really set it up and, and you can hear every single word.  Because my brother said, my brother was part of the eight-hour rehearsal because they never did a gig before.  And he said, uh, you gotta hear, you know, the sound wasn't the greatest at FH Riles, but it was good enough.  He says, it's unbelievable how good it is. 
[02:26:00]  Mm-hmm.  And my brother, uh, sang, uh, Put the Fucking Lotion in the Basket.  He did a little opera number with, uh, Pat from Menachie.  And Pat was in a dumb blonde wig, uh, playing his role.  Dude, Jimmy, it was hilarious.  I, I was amazed.  Yeah, Pat was wearing a wig.  I was amazed.  And he had a little dog with him.  Right.  And then you had Poe going up there to sing When Doves Cry, which is a staple of the show now.  And you had Anthony doing, uh, a few of his numbers that are staples of the show.  Sure.  I'm trying to remember some of the other, uh, obscure ones. 
[02:26:30]  Like, out of nowhere, they would sing a song.  I'm like, holy crap, I forgot that we used to play that.  Uh, Patrick.  Hello.  What's going on, Patrick?  Good evening.  Well, uh, thanks a lot.  I, I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm just, uh, I'm amazed myself at how well it was received, so.  Yeah, I'm not going to lie to you.  I was very skeptical, like I said.  But, uh, you guys pulled it off and you were great at FH Reilly's.  To the point.  Thank you.  I wrote a bunch of people on, uh, yesterday morning. 
[02:27:00]  And we want you guys to perform live here at XM a week from Friday, the day before we take a vacation.  A week from Friday.  Okay.  I'll have to, uh, I'll have to get that together.  I mean, you got to get the rehearsals in and really sound really, really tight.  Crisp.  We bring in all the people that you need because they're, they're constantly calling up guest vocalists to do their roles.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, and we want to air the whole thing on XM.  Some, sometime, uh, a week from Friday.  Because we usually call it in the day before we go on vacation anyway. 
[02:27:30]  So this could be a, a good way to send, uh, send us off on vacation for a couple of weeks.  All right.  I'll, uh, I'll, I'll have to get word out to everyone.  I'll have to take a day off from work.  Alert the band.  Hey, Patrick.  What other songs did you guys perform?  I'm trying to remember all of them.  You did, like, Black Girl, obviously.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, we did Lady McCartney.  We did, uh, yeah, geez, I gotta remember now.  Um, you know what?  I got a set list.  Fez sang, uh, Makes You Fez. 
[02:28:00]  Yep.  It was a 40 song set list.  Wow.  I don't know if he played all 40.  Jesus.  And they didn't.  Actually, pretty close to 30.  30.  Okay.  And it seemed like you played just about all of them.  Yeah, we did Shelter Me, the Grey Wolf song.  We did, uh.  Yeah, we did Shelter Me.  Run XM, right?  Run XM, right?  Yeah.  Yes?  This is XM now?  Yes.  We did Put the Fucking Lotion.  We did, uh, Jump Into the Fire from Goodfellas.  Uh, we did some Rock Up with Anthony.  Thanks a lot, Anthony, for coming up.  Oh, sure. 
[02:28:30]  Anytime.  Uh, we had Dawn get up.  We had Dawn do some of the stuff that she does at the Karaoke Nights at FH Riley's.  And then just to change it up, we had her put on a bass and actually play bass with us.  Yeah, Dawn plays the bass guitar.  Hmm?  Oh, just commenting.  Patrick's sleepy.  We, we were up, uh, for, uh, Easter yesterday.  Yeah.  Over Mommy's house.  Yeah, but you're not supposed to be hungover after Easter.  Jesus.  No.  Get it together, Patrick.  A little drinking. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, a little bit of drinking.  On Easter?  It's Easter.  You gotta drink.  Maybe a little wine.  For the baby Jesus.  It's a big party holiday, isn't it?  For the baby Jesus.  Huh?  I mean, it syncs up with that pagan fertility festivities and all that.  You gotta drink.  Easter?  Wow.  Yeah, that's the whole thing with the bunnies and the eggs, right?  I thought it was just when Jesus turned into a zombie.  Let's be honest with each other, Patrick.  You're not doing too well on the phone, but you were great at FH Riley's on Saturday night  with the band.  Right.  Art of the topless.  Oh, you know, that's what I do. 
[02:29:30]  I don't do this.  I do that.  So, a week from Friday, we want to get this together.  XM's willing to fly up some of their experts and, and, uh, make sure you have a great sound  a week from Friday.  Uh, we're thinking 10, 10.30, so it goes into Ron and Fez a little bit, and we want you  to play your whole set.  Or not your whole set, like a best of set, maybe an hour.  Okay.  And then we'll have the guest vocalists, we'll get Stalker Patty and the rest of them.  I'm sure you can talk Anthony into singing a song or two.  Or two, and then, uh, we'll, we'll let everyone else hear, uh, what you guys did on Saturday 
[02:30:00]  at FH.  Great.  It's a, it's a huge opportunity, so get the band, uh, out of work.  Because, and then, uh, then Eric Logan was talking about maybe doing some things with  you.  You might be onto something, is what we're saying.  Okay.  Well, cool.  That's, that's great news.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks for everything you guys have done.  You know, I'm, I'm happy to be able to do something to kind of get back here.  Get a hold of yourself.  All right.  Get a hold of yourself.  Feel like Cheswick as McMurphy's leaving.  I gotta say, I was very excited to talk about the time, uh, at FH this Saturday with Art 
[02:30:30]  the Topless, and now I'm, uh, regretting it.  Now I, I, now I'm not that excited anymore.  Are you gonna say goodbye to me, Mac?  Settle down, Charles.  All right, Patrick.  All right, thanks a lot.  Later, man.  Get the band together for a week from Friday.  That's all you need to know right now.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Anyway, so then, holy shit.  Oh, was that like pulling teeth?  Was that pulling teeth?  It wasn't that pleasant.  Um, it was like.  Patrick gets a band together and then the songs together and everything. 
[02:31:00]  Like, he's not a radio guy.  And all of a sudden he was like a rock star up there.  Yeah.  Pointing and winking.  He's singing.  He's pointing.  He's doing everything.  And then, uh, getting on the phone with the radio.  Eh, it's a little different.  I just know him as the creep that takes pictures of everybody from far away.  And now, now, like it's on Saturday, he's just this huge rock star on the stage.  Like, same guy.  What the hell's going on here?  Anyway, whatever.  We'll, we'll put it together and then, then we'll show you how great it really was.  Because that, he really doesn't know how to sell his band yet. 
[02:31:30]  He really doesn't.  But, so now I'm talking to Anthony and, um, we want to start, uh, Exploitation Fridays on, uh, The Opie and Anthony Show for the, the next few weeks.  Yeah.  We started with Slave Girl.  Uh, we're thinking of doing something with Prison Babes.  And then we need more, more themes for Exploitation Fridays.  Gratuitous nudity.  Yeah, well, Grindhouse is bringing back the exploitation film a little bit.  We did Slave Girl.  We're thinking there's something there.  Some, some kind of science fiction theme where we can get a, uh, woman. 
[02:32:00]  Uh, uh, maybe nude.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, to be molested by a robot.  Nude.  Good, good.  Something like that.  There you go.  So we need some more ideas for Exploitation Friday.  A creature thing.  Creature thing.  Where someone in a bad creature mask, uh, picks up a woman.  Nude.  And, uh, she's got to give her best, like, uh, B-movie scream.  Well, how about a stump?  Like in, uh, like in, uh, the first part of the Rodriguez movie.  Uh, a girl with a stump.  A stump.  Has to do something. 
[02:32:30]  Right.  We need an amputee girl.  By the way, Jimmy, a lot of phone calls saying how great you are, but I, of course.  Oh, that's okay.  Yeah.  Jimmy's the man.  But I just want to acknowledge they're there.  Oh, dude, no.  I never mind.  No one's great on Miami.  My, my only problem with that guy was that he was just, he just wouldn't say what he didn't  like because he's a faggot.  That's the only problem I have with that.  I don't think he likes me.  All right.  Just be a man.  Just be a man.  Yeah.  But it gets, it gets the, you know, your fans, uh, pissed.  Oh, no, that's all right.  Please, that's the odds.  I just want to acknowledge the people out there, all right?  Don't be mad.  Jimmy knows your love.  It's appreciated.  All right.  So, yeah. 
[02:33:00]  Exploitation Front coming to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Maybe the message boards can help us out.  We're trying to come up with some more themes.  So far, we only got Slave Girl and Prison Babes for, for sure.  Yeah.  Um, but from Friday Show, cause, uh, Jimmy, you missed one of the greatest lines in Opie  and Anthony history.  Ooh.  It's within these three or four clips.  Oh, it's the third track.  Okay.  Francine just delivers one of the best lines ever.  We have the lovely Francine in, and, uh, she was just going to read the news.  But, uh, I don't know.  She's done it before.  She read through a few, and we're like, not really feeling it. 
[02:33:30]  And then, uh, Opie brought up the idea of maybe Slave Girl.  We had no idea what that was supposed to be, and kind of just crafted it on the air.  We had a moment with Louis C.K., cause, all of a sudden, Francine's just in here.  I'm like, hey, why don't we play Slave Girl?  And Louis C.K. looks at us like, Slave Girl, like, we know exactly what that is, and we're  just breaking out a bit.  He goes, oh, cool.  How do you play?  And I look at Louis, and I go, I don't know.  We don't know.  We just made this up.  We're going to make it up as we go.  And Louis C.K.'s eyes got really big, and he's like, this is the show I need to be on.  He goes, oh, you're just spitballing it. 
[02:34:00]  We're like, yeah.  Yeah, that's what we do.  And he thought that was the greatest thing from a creative standpoint.  And he's like, wait, you're just going to make up Slave Girl live on the air?  I'm like, yeah, we're going to make it up.  And we figured it out.  Of course, it entailed Francine pulling her pants down and showing her her panties.  She wears awful panties, by the way.  Those striped ones.  Patrice loved them.  He said he was going to jack off to them later on.  Wear a thong or boy shorts.  Those fucking awful striped panties.  She's wearing striped panties.  We had to keep telling her to pull them up, because they were all baggy in the back. 
[02:34:30]  Of course they were.  And, well, she got them pretty tight.  And then Danny came in with the paddle.  And then we had a scenario worked out.  We had a couple of them that didn't kind of work.  Like, some people like some scenarios, others like the other.  But the key was she was the slave girl.  Well, yeah.  Well, the first track, the paddling begins, Francine isn't into it yet.  Yeah.  We need to motivate her a little bit.  She really came alive.  Because at first, you know, she needed direction.  An actress without direction, ah, they're not going to give you their best. 
[02:35:00]  No.  All right, here we go.  Listen to this.  Slate girl.  Spank me, master.  Oh, she wants it.  Ah.  Spank me harder, master.  This stinks.  You got to stay with some emotion.  Don't hit me, man.  No, master.  You don't want it.  You don't want it.  You got to explain it to her.  Get a little emotion.  No, master.  Oh, please.  Yeah, you totally don't know about slavery.  You didn't like this.  No, master.  Please don't hit me.  No, master.  No, master.  Please don't hit me.  No, there's got to be a panic in your voice.  Lucy K is a big wig in the entertainment business. 
[02:35:30]  You never know.  You never know.  I can put you in a movie.  A big wig.  I made pootie town.  He wrote with Chris Rock.  He's got a watch proving it.  Say like, just say, oh, no, master.  Like, oh.  No, master, please.  No, master, please don't hurt me.  No, master, please don't hurt me.  Not bad.  That's a hurt.  Oh, it fucking hurts.  She turns around and gets pissed off at Danny because he's hitting a little too hard.  Yeah, Danny's hitting her a little hard.  Well, you had that big, heavy paddle.  Yeah, so far.  That didn't help. 
[02:36:00]  So far, who cares?  Right, Jimmy?  No, it's all right.  I care.  I like it.  But, I mean, it's got to start somewhere when you're making it up on the spot.  So then the next track here, Francine gets her motivation and sets her up.  It really puts the whole slave girl thing over.  I didn't think she, because she was having a problem without it being put in the context.  So I had to play the slave master, even though Danny was doing the beating over the radio.  You can't tell, so.  Yeah, Danny's doing it.  Jeff from Philly.  Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.  Slave girl, wow.  Replaying a drawn-out bit you did in the last show. 
[02:36:30]  I'll check back in tomorrow.  And could you lose that we're only playing it for Jimmy a bit?  He has XM.  He heard the replay.  Did you hear slave girl?  No.  Well, obviously, you're a liar, Jimmy.  And now, because Jeff kind of challenged us today, he thinks he knows more about radio.  Could everyone call right now that did not hear slave girl on Friday?  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Watch the phones explode.  Hey, idiot.  You know nothing about radio and the way it works.  Most people didn't hear it.  Jeff, if you really need to know, because maybe you're, I don't know, maybe you're in management or something. 
[02:37:00]  Maybe you do your own radio show.  Maybe, I don't know.  Maybe you're a dumb cunt.  The real reason we're replaying slave girl right now is, one, yes, because of, uh...  Hello?  Hi.  You said to call if we didn't hear the bit.  This is Jim Norton, and I didn't hear it.  Jimmy, you're staring right at me.  You don't have to be on the phone. 
[02:37:30]  You could have just said, well, you said to do something and I'll do it.  You say jump, I say how high.  That's the way it is, Boston.  You look ridiculous being on the phone talking to me as you're staring at me.  Ba-ba-booing, ba-ba-booing.  Oh, damn it.  We were taking.  I thought that was Jimmy.  I was looking at him.  He was on the phone.  Every time his lips moved, the words came out of the radio.  See, we'll show our knowledge.  The reason we're replaying this is, A, because we think Jim Norton would enjoy it, and maybe  it would give us a little more take on the actual slave girl bit. 
[02:38:00]  Yep.  And secondly, because we just set up Exploitation Fridays, this is another way to kind of push  that concept forward.  That's what you do in radio, you dope.  You're a self-important douchebag who thinks that you're the only one listening to this  show.  See, you heard the show.  You heard this.  So you assume that everyone is like you and was listening.  There are plenty of people that didn't hear it, you dumb fuck. 
[02:38:30]  Let's say hi to Eric in New York.  Eric.  Hey, boys.  Good morning.  I had no idea what you guys were talking about.  I did not hear the show.  And how many hours a week do you listen to us?  I could probably say that I listen to maybe 30 hours a week.  Swear.  Swear.  Eric, we don't need.  I mean, I swear to God, we don't need anyone kissing our ass.  We want people just to tell the truth.  The XM radio does not get changed from 2.02.  I listen to you on replays and I listen to you in the morning and I missed it. 
[02:39:00]  You know the average person on regular radio listens way less than an hour a day?  Well, I could say that I listen to more than an hour.  So you're saying you listen to about 30 hours a week and you did not hear Slave Girl?  I did not hear it now.  Thank you.  And you're being honest, right?  I am.  Well, Opie, one caller.  What is one caller going to prove?  We're doing this for Jeff.  Chris in the Bronx.  What's up, boys?  Let's see.  Friday, if I'm not mistaken, it was a holiday.  Wasn't it a good Friday?  A lot of people off of work.  Well, you know, I could add that to the reason we're playing it today as well.  We had a very, very small audience on Friday because a ton of people had a good Friday off. 
[02:39:30]  You're absolutely right.  I forgot about that one as well.  Exactly.  Well, I'm sure that doesn't make any difference.  Did you hear it, Chris?  No, I did not.  And how many hours a week do you listen to the show?  I'm a UPS driver.  I got an hour commute coming down and it's on to my truck every time I'm in and out.  Is it safe to say you listen 10 hours a week?  Easily.  Easily.  And you didn't hear the bit.  Thank you.  This is for Jeff who thinks he knows more than we do.  He didn't hear.  Bob in Ohio.  Bob.  Hey, I want to hear it because it sounds like Francine is getting pretty hot and worked up. 
[02:40:00]  I didn't hear anything Friday.  There you go.  Okay.  Should we keep going?  Anthony in Connecticut.  Anthony.  Hey, guys.  I can't wait for Mohegan Sun.  That's going to be the greatest show ever.  But anyway, I did not hear it.  I was at church.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Dork.  James in Riverhead.  James.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  I did not hear it.  And I listened to you.  I'm up at about 8 in the morning.  I cast the last hour of that.  See?  Douchebag.  It's at a different time than we played it. 
[02:40:30]  That's another thing we're doing right now.  You just don't understand radio.  So you come off looking like an ass.  What was his name?  Jeff from Philly.  You know what?  Jeff from Philly is a homosexual.  I would take more calls, but quite frankly, they're not calling.  So four people didn't hear the bit.  See?  Four people.  All right.  And other people are saying they did hear it on Friday, and they do want to hear it again  because they missed it on the replay.  I want to hear it.  All right. 
[02:41:00]  So Francine gets her motivation for Slave Girl, and Ant helps her out and sets her up nicely.  This isn't the really good clip.  That's next.  Okay.  Oh, I've been bad, master.  No, more emotion, like you're on the verge of tears.  She's delving from white girl to black slave.  She's like, oh, I've been so bad, man.  All right.  You know what?  What am I supposed to be again?  Am I supposed to be scared?  Yeah, yeah.  You're supposed to be a big identity place.  Let's give her motivation.  You're scared.  You did something wrong. 
[02:41:30]  Maybe think what that might have been and said, I know I've been bad.  I know I shouldn't have whatever.  That type of thing.  Begging for mercy.  You broke a fucking crystal glass.  Right.  Okay.  And the guy, fucking big white guy with a beard came in and sees the shattered glass  and looks at you.  Why, you've broken my porcelain.  Hey, can we go to the house?  Oh, I didn't mean to, master.  There we go.  There we go.  I didn't mean to.  Please don't hit me, all that shit.  Please don't hit me. 
[02:42:00]  I won't do it again.  Oh, shit.  She does such a good job.  Yeah.  Oh, please, master.  What?  I want to go to the phones and talk to more people who didn't hear the pitch.  Well, the phones crept out from too much volume.  No, there's some...  Too many phone calls.  Yeah, say too many.  We made our point, Jimmy.  I just want to talk to somebody.  I mean, trust me, we made our point. 
[02:42:30]  All right, here's Patrice gives the scenario because we weren't happy with that take.  We wanted a better take.  So Patrice gets involved, helps with the scenario, and then Francine finally gives line of maybe  the year.  She was sucking...  I'm a field hand.  She's house, right?  Yeah.  She was sucking...  She got caught sucking my dick in the house.  I was getting there. 
[02:43:00]  In the house.  In the house.  All right, so you're dead.  Master caught me.  You're fucking strung up out back.  I am dead, and she is trying to live.  That's right.  All right, yeah.  You are dead on the floor.  So now...  At her feet.  And now as you're pleading, you got to kind of like...  I'm pleading for my life.  And say, I know I did what Patrice said, but mercy, blah, blah, blah.  Started out with a...  I think you kind of know that...  Because you got to spit the cum out of your mouth.  I think you kind of know that if you take his beating, Massa's going to jack off on your  ass and go to sleep. 
[02:43:30]  So this part of you that's optimistic because you've been down this road, this isn't the  first field nigger that you've blown and gotten killed.  It happens about twice monthly.  Split fuck from North Carolina.  He's got an idea.  Let's say she got caught reading the news.  Yes.  Well, they wouldn't look kindly on that.  No.  No.  All right.  Let's go.  All right.  Scene.  Now.  Although if they heard her reading the news, they'd be like, all right, we're not much  of a threat.  Wait, wait.  Go ahead.  Start me off, Anthony.  Why, what is this?  Let me get the scene done. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, I'm home from town and why, why, what is this I see here?  Are you blowing the field nigger?  Down goes Patrice.  There goes Patrice.  What the?  Oh, no, master.  I didn't mean to blow the field nigger.  Oh, my God.  We're on to something now. 
[02:44:30]  This is crazy.  We're on to something now.  All right.  See, it started with nothing and instinct.  It developed for like an hour.  I didn't mean to.  The way she says that is so fucking funny.  She kind of gets all flustered before she says it.  Mm-hmm.  Francine gets hit really hard here and screams.  Oh, no, master.  I didn't mean to blow the field nigger. 
[02:45:00]  Well, I walked in here and caught you blowing the field nigger.  Now, you're going to have to pay.  No, master.  I was just so horny.  Jesus.  He got me worked up in a ferry.  Now, you take this.  You're young.  You just have to hit her harder.  That's all this takes.  How dare you bring that boy into my house? 
[02:45:30]  You apologize to master.  I apologize, master.  Oh, my God.  And there you have it for Friday, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  That's kind of sexy, man.  Sure.  What would be sexy about that?  She would turn around and start yelling at Danny.  She would get so pissed off.  Danny?  What the fuck, Danny?  Danny gave her a couple of really good whacks on the ass. 
[02:46:00]  We got some pictures up on opianthony.com from Friday's show.  So, one of the best ones was the one we played earlier, where she'd go like, oh, shit.  Yeah.  So, we want to audition more girls to do Slave Girl on the O.P. and Anthony show, and then  we want to get this exploitation Friday.  Yeah.  So, we'll see what happens in the coming weeks.  Tom in Philly, what's up?  Hey, I love you.  I love the show.  Jeff from Philly is a faggot, and I didn't hear it on Friday.  Thank you, sir.  Bye-bye.  Bye. 
[02:46:30]  Let's go to Rich in Wyoming.  Rich?  Hey there, Rich.  Hey.  Hey, Rich.  Hey.  Hi.  Rich?  What do you got for the show?  Hi.  Hey, Rich.  I can barely hear you guys.  I was just calling.  I didn't hear that Friday.  Hello.  Is Rich there?  Rich?  You're on the air.  Hey, Rich.  Hey, I didn't hear that Friday, that slave girl.  Why is he not talking?  Rich!  Rich, go ahead.  You're on the air with O.P. and Anthony.  Okay.  Can you hear me? 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, Rich.  What do you got?  What do you got?  Hey, I was just calling to tell you I didn't hear that Friday.  Is Rich on the line?  Rich?  I'm trying to hear Rich.  Rich is on the phone.  I guess I'm not on the phone.  All right.  Push that button down.  There we go.  On hold.  Say hi right now.  Hi.  All right.  I hear him.  All right, Rich.  Rich, what do you got for the show today, Rich?  Wyoming.  Hey, I was just letting you know I didn't hear that Friday. 
[02:47:30]  I don't hear much.  Rich?  Rich.  Holy shit.  Whose phone is that?  It's crazy.  Whose phone is that?  Are you fucking with me?  Someone's phone is ringing.  Let's say hi to Andrew on Long Island.  Andrew.  Fucking hi.  I don't know, LNA.  What's up?  Not much.  I probably listen to the show about 50 hours a week.  Andrew's on the phone.  I didn't hear Slave Girl.  You didn't hear Slave Girl?  I think we made our point.  Did you enjoy that?  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  I also got a midget story.  Oh. 
[02:48:00]  This is unprecedented.  You're actually calling for two things at the same time.  Oh, this is coming.  Yup.  We interrupt this program to bring you the Ozone Midget Sighting of the Day.  All right.  All right.  Me and my wife are in Dunkin' Donuts.  What is coming?  What?  Me and my wife are in Dunkin' Donuts.  And I'm ordering everything.  And a lady behind the counter is like, you know, does she want anything?  I'm like, no, that's my wife. 
[02:48:30]  She's with me.  And all of a sudden, this little thing comes walking out behind my wife.  And I just started laughing hysterical because I didn't even know that she was behind there.  And it was just, it was pretty funny.  I think she had to be there.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  You crashed and burned with a...  You don't call a radio show with a, I guess you have to be there story.  Yeah.  All right.  You should have said something funny.  Like they said, what do you want? 
[02:49:00]  And I wanted munchkins.  And then this midget walked out.  I said, give me a box of that thing.  Wow.  Thank you, guys.  The least you could have done was like a munchkins joke or something.  Yeah.  I know.  There's so much to work with there.  Yeah.  I wasn't thinking.  Or how you bought coffee and it was hot and you didn't get any milk and you threw it in the midget's face  and everyone laughed and pointed while he ran around with his little fat hands that couldn't reach his cheeks.  You're going to have to apologize, Jimmy.  I apologize.  The midget groups are listening.  You're right.  I apologize to the midgets. 
[02:49:30]  All right.  We're going to take a break and get into some things.  We got a nice studio audience.  Yeah.  Where'd they come from?  Well, you got a lot of Mets fans because they're going to opening day.  Opening day.  Even though it's winter in New York.  Enjoy a freezing cold day.  Wonderful.  I gave my nosebleed seats away to Danny.  So you'll see Danny.  Danny's going?  Yeah.  Way, way, way up in right field.  Way, way up.  At least you're there though, right?  Absolutely. 
[02:50:00]  I've never been to, you know, my Mets opening day.  Oh, okay.  So it's exciting for me.  Yeah.  It's going to be freezing.  Great.  Have fun.  All right.  Maybe the fucking jet exhaust will keep you warm.  The plane's taking off and it looks whitey up.  All right.  Closer to the jets than home plate.  Yeah, exactly.  I saw those seats.  Oh, ****.  The virus is out.  Tell your friends.  He's infected.  That's right, O.P.  Hey, shut your ****.  Shut your mouth. 
[02:50:30]  I love the homoerotic nature of the whole event.  The virus made my genitals rot off.  Oh, dude, don't come near me.  We're your celebrity skin cancer connection.  And it was better than my first kiss.  Oh, laugh until your energy spill out on the chair.  Anthony Show.  All right.  We go right to the instant feedback.  I want to make a plea.  For all the haters out there, stop hiding behind your keyboards. 
[02:51:00]  And call the fucking show.  The number's right on your unit.  Stop being pushed behind your keyboards.  Enough.  Jim in Michigan.  Prima Donna fuck.  Still whining about the free tickets that half a million people would love to have.  Buy your own tickets, you cheap bastard.  Talking about the Mets home opener today, right?  Eric Logan announced that he was getting us tickets for the Yankees home opener for these guys.  They're big Yankees fans.  And tickets for myself for the home opener at Shea.  Now, Jim, maybe you have, like, low self-worth, so it's okay in your world. 
[02:51:30]  A couple things.  First of all, I do buy my tickets to the Mets.  I go to a few games every year, and I buy them.  I don't ask anyone for them.  Every once in a while, I'm offered free tickets.  And if I'm free, I'll take them, and I'm very grateful.  Sure.  But we work for a company where we make a shitload of money for them.  And after many, many years, well over 20 years of being treated like shit in radio,  Stupid Me has decided that maybe I should be treated a little better.  So when your big boss says he's got tickets for the home opener, I didn't ask for the tickets to the home opener, by the way. 
[02:52:00]  I wasn't even going to go to the home opener, because this time of year, I don't really give a shit about baseball when hockey's still being played.  So I wait a little longer, wait for the season to develop, and then I'll go, you know, get your game or two at Shea Stadium.  But when the boss says he's going to get you tickets for the home opener, they better damn well be good seats.  Sorry.  My self-worth's a lot higher than yours, obviously, Jim.  It's okay for you, I guess.  But it's not okay for me and the amount of money we bring in for XM. 
[02:52:30]  He wouldn't take them.  That is a fact.  Yes, you're 100% right.  Because I do have a higher self-worth, okay?  He wouldn't take them.  The tickets were completely ridiculous.  It was almost in the last row of the stadium in right field.  You could see the parking lot a hell of a lot better than home plate.  Awful seats.  Yes, I should bitch.  Especially considering that the Yankee tickets were pretty much right off third base.  In the dugout.  In the Yankees dugout.  You got to hang out with the players.  It was wonderful. 
[02:53:00]  I'm not looking for the best seat in the house, but I'm looking for something that's a little  respectable.  You know why?  A couple seats that are respectable.  And I don't want any jokes, Jimmy.  I'm serious.  I'm pissed off that we're treated like that.  Keep the jokes to yourself, you.  But I had a good one.  All right, go ahead.  What the hell?  It is a comedy show.  Go ahead.  Two Jews walking to a park.  That's a good one.  I love it.  He thinks I asked for tickets, and this is the best they could do, and I'm complaining.  I never asked for the tickets, so.  The bottom line is this. 
[02:53:30]  It's like, if someone says I got home opener tickets, it's like, you know, it's like, you  can't say it, but I'll say it for you.  Personally, look, he's Opie from the Opie and Anthony show.  If he's going to get tickets from the boss who has the contract for baseball, and it's  a high-profile show that does well for XM, you have to understand, Jim, they have tickets  that they didn't pay for for Major League Baseball.  And look, if these tickets were for a dude that's on the boneyard, then they're perfect.  Let's be honest. 
[02:54:00]  They're a perfect seat.  You know, for Jim Slouch that's just spinning.  Spinning hair bands.  Yeah.  You know, he's going to be very appreciative, of course.  Or a non-white.  Right.  Right.  I'm amazed.  Reverend Al has a talk show?  He's got a radio show?  I guess.  Where does Reverend Al have a radio show?  It's on the line in New York.  He couldn't get a New York radio station.  Are you serious?  Yes.  And you know what?  He's using Imus to get a little attention for his radio show.  Despite Imus' scheduled appearance, Sharpton said his position was unchanged. 
[02:54:30]  He wants Imus fired and intends to write the FCC about the matter.  What could he possibly write?  Oh, yeah.  Well, fat...  No, whatever.  Fat complaining.  I love the people that threaten that they're going to, like, write a letter to the FCC.  They have no clue how the FCC works.  No.  You're allowed to say that.  Yeah.  This is not an FCC violation.  An FCC violation.  Reverend Al should know that by now.  And he's in radio, and he's writing a complaint against another person to the FCC. 
[02:55:00]  Right, right.  What kind of shit is that?  You don't do that.  Now I insulted Elo.  Elo.  Hey, guys.  Hi, Eric.  Welcome aboard.  Elo.  How are you?  Oh, I'm peachy green.  Elo.  Yeah.  That was about Elo.  You're forgetting Elo's got sound effects.  I love his car crash.  Elo.  Yes, sir?  You gave me really bad seats.  I'm very depressed. 
[02:55:30]  I had to pay for it myself out of my pocket.  Oh, my God.  Elo bought those.  Well, Danny's going to enjoy the game today.  And the only reason why is because I just didn't have the hard tickets from the Mets.  We've got great seats from the Mets.  The Mets are great.  I just didn't have them.  I would go to another game.  I don't want to.  Did you see where those seats were?  You paid for them.  You know what?  Listen.  When was the last time you sat up there?  I don't.  I would never go.  You would never sit there.  Wait, Elo.  What happened?  The Mets didn't give you good tickets for opening?  No, no, no.  We just didn't get the tickets in yet.  We didn't get them fast enough. 
[02:56:00]  And they're not even in the building, so I don't even know where.  You know you hinted that the seats were really good.  And then when I opened up the package, I got so excited.  I go, Than, Than, show me where I'm sitting for the home opener.  And then everyone just started douche-chilling in the studio, to be honest with you.  Yeah, it's behind the Big Apple when they hit a home run.  Elo, it might as well be.  Seriously, did you see where these seats were?  Yeah, I did.  I did.  And I just took a chance and said, you know, he's going to be really pissed, so I'll send him anyway.  And then it kind of hurt because then Jimmy and Ant were looking at their tickets, 
[02:56:30]  and they were way, it wasn't even close.  And do you know what Opie actually said?  No one heard this, but Opie actually said, if life was a ball of cherries, I'd get the pit.  Tough words.  And I didn't mean for it to get that crazy, but it was out of hand.  Did you really pay for him?  Yes, I did.  You're a sweet guy, Eric.  Now I would feel so bad.  It's much easier for me to do that than it is to not, you know, can you imagine what would happen if I sent a package up there and there was nothing in there? 
[02:57:00]  I guess it's the thought that counts.  Well, again, you are very close to throwing out the first pitch for one of the upcoming Mets games, by the way.  Yeah, really?  No, you are.  Watch what I do with the first pitch.  I can't wait.  Watch what I do.  It's never been done before.  You're going to throw it like the mayor of, what was that, Detroit?  Holy shit.  What did he do?  He fucking threw it almost to first base.  What?  It was hysterical.  Yeah.  I didn't see this yet.  He was so off.  He throws it, and the ball ended up, I swear, it bypassed everybody. 
[02:57:30]  It went in the batter's circle.  It went in the dugout.  Yeah.  Into the dugout.  So what happened?  He just got caught up on his stock.  He fucking choked.  Mayor of Detroit?  Yeah, he threw it with his foot.  Hey, hey.  If an Elo hang up, he should.  Why?  No, he's here.  The guy has no aim.  Elo.  You see, uh, Imus?  Yeah, as a corporate, uh, douche, um.  Oh, no.  He paid for the tickets.  This is our friend.  Oh, God.  Yeah, whatever.  This is our friend. 
[02:58:00]  He told the merger, and he goes, look, guys.  What do you think of the Imus situation?  Like, as management, what would you do in an Imus case?  I mean, if...  And where's the pressure coming from?  Give us a little insight.  The pressure...  I mean, I think the pressure is coming, uh, clearly from, uh, the political groups.  I actually think that Imus got on the wrong side of some politicians.  And, uh, and the politicians, uh, got together, and they decided to go after him, because,  as you guys have been talking about on a morning, he says things much worse, and has been saying 
[02:58:30]  things much worse than this.  And it was totally benign, what he was saying.  Yeah.  And I agree with you, Jim.  He was quoting a Spike Lee movie, for God's sake.  So...  Yeah.  So do you think that it...  Because he really is rambling on, like, they didn't deserve to be made fun of.  It's just like, it just like, it doesn't seem like...  It's not coming from Imus.  It's like something, there's something we're not seeing.  I don't know what it is.  He's under, he's under, well, I think he's got the ad, it'd be one thing if he was just  on the radio, but you gotta remember, he's also on MSNBC, too.  I mean, I think more of the pressure's coming from that side than the radio side. 
[02:59:00]  Okay, so maybe it's like he's afraid of losing his TV gig, a nice, lucrative, fun gig.  Yeah.  I mean, I mean, but listen, if, uh, you know, if he was on XM, I'd be standing up defending,  you know, his right, uh, freedom of speech, freedom of choice, uh, you know.  And then you can always say, listen, you don't agree or disagree with what he  had to say, which is kind of what you guys have been saying.  It's a joke, but whether or not you agree or disagree is not the issue.  The issue is that, you know, he has a right to say what he wants to say, and there's choice  in the radio, and what he said is not illegal.  And it wasn't even mean spirit, it was just silly, and, and, and, you know, kind of a, 
[02:59:30]  you know, a corny reference, like an old white guy making the young black guy reference  from, you know, like Patricia, like the 80s or whatever, but it wasn't vicious.  Elo, you know who went at it today?  And it was, it was great to see, and unfortunately we couldn't get it on the radio, uh, Jimmy and  Tom Chiasano.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  About that issue.  Tom completely disagrees and think, uh, Imus was out of line.  Yeah.  He was out of line for saying, which amazes me.  Has Tom listened to Don Imus recently in the past 10 years?  I don't know.  Probably not.  No.  I mean, again, it's like not to defend or not to defend the guy, but I mean, again, why 
[03:00:00]  now, why all of a sudden, it's an election year, you've got, I mean, you've got all these  issues coming up, why now do they single it out?  It's really weird, um, and, and Tom's disagreement, and, uh, was, I think Tom is probably a guy  who went to college in the late 60s, so he's probably got like that mentality, like that  whole, you know what I mean?  Like that whole, uh, like hippie.  Not what he, maybe hippie, or maybe he's like a very like, oh man, you can't be meeting  the people on that level.  I don't know.  I don't know his politics or anything, but it was kind of weird to him take that over such a mellow 
[03:00:30]  thing.  He's like, he should have apologized.  No, he should have.  You know, he's been around this type of radio for so long, too.  I mean, and to say that was really surprising, because we're not trying to do hate speech  with our radio show, but every once in a while, you're going to say something that's going  to get someone's attention, unfortunately, and in a lot of cases, you get fired for it.  Well, the scary part is, is forget that I'm, forget what I'm has said.  It's more of a precedent if all of a sudden we start allowing people and public opinion  and people to start regulating free speech.  I mean, at that point, once you start down that path, where does it stop? 
[03:01:00]  I mean, does it stop there?  I mean, if it starts, if it starts with what I said, where does it end?  And every other group's going to come back, and then you're going to be doing the knock-knock  jokes, Anthony, that you were doing earlier today.  That's right.  And as much, I'm sorry, Eric, but as much as people have been complaining about the conservatives  and free speech, and they have been atrocious, the political correctness, which look, the  corporations are enforcing it, but that kind of comes from a left mentality.  It's like everybody, like both sides of politics are finding reasons that certain things should 
[03:01:30]  not be allowed to be said.  And it's really, really irritating.  I mean, but if you keep going down this path and you allow, and first of all, let's say  that there's some sort of movement.  I think CBS has some sort of sensitivity training that tells you what you can and can't say over  their air.  But imagine if you're watching The Sopranos like last night.  Do you think the owners of Monopoly are going to stand up and say to David Chase, the creator  of the show, going, why are you mocking my game by having a greenhouse stuck to the cheek  of Tony Soprano?  I mean, at what point does it stop? 
[03:02:00]  Yeah, it's an awful example, but I mean, we know what you mean.  See, I figured I took too many shots.  I figured I'd leave that one for something else.  That had nothing to do with race, you know.  Well, no, but my point is, my point is, is that...  How come the railroads don't go anywhere?  There you go.  There you go.  That's a better one.  What are you talking about?  But I know what you mean.  I thought when you were saying Sopranos, I thought you were going to say, because they'll  say nigger or they'll say, you know, whatever.  They'll say racist stuff about, you know, Italian or the Irish because it's true to what they're 
[03:02:30]  doing.  So why is that so acceptable for, like, actors to do it?  But he does a harmless thing and he has to grovel.  He never should apologize.  He should have told everybody just to die.  He's groveling now to a point where it's over-groveling.  He's apologizing for things that, like, don't even mean anything, like that, oh, those are  a nice bunch of girls and they didn't deserve that.  So he's apologizing, like, personally to them.  It's ridiculous.  If you want to apologize.  I mean, look, I mean, if you're going to apologize, and by the way, we've all been in situations 
[03:03:00]  where you've either had to or thought about it or not, if you're going to do it, do it  one time.  But I agree with you.  Why he's taking the entire show or, what, going on three or four hours now and making it  this giant apology?  I don't understand.  Make your apology and move on.  Yeah.  I mean, there's something more going on.  It just doesn't seem like it's so over the top.  Well, that's why I think it has to do with politics.  That's why I think that he got on the wrong side somewhere, you know, because he's very  wired into politics, as you guys know.  I mean, he is every politician from the beltway to get on the air with him. 
[03:03:30]  He got sideways with somebody and he is getting a lot of pressure.  And I don't have any insight.  I got to believe it's coming from the TV side, from MSNBC, because this is a, you know,  for all intents and purposes, you know, this third news network.  And in many regards, it's, you know, surpassed CNN in terms of news entertainment.  So, you know, it's a very powerful brand in D.C., MSNBC is.  And so there's a lot of pressure being applied to him.  Well, I mean, I guess he's afraid of losing the gig, but it's like, God, sometimes you just  got to go, you know what, hold, you know, worry about what you, the garden riots. 
[03:04:00]  Why not fire back, say, look, I apologize, what I said was stupid, and then fire back.  Stop.  You can't grovel to a guy like Sharpton.  The guy's a piece of shit.  Yeah, he'll stay on you.  He's not an honest guy.  He's not a guy with integrity.  He called white people interlopers and their store was burned down.  He's never held accountable.  Well, CNN all morning has been running.  It had, you know, CNN has had experts on the air playing both sides.  So is Fox and Friends.  So you've got all three major networks involved with this thing right now. 
[03:04:30]  And so you've got to determine from the CNN, Fox side, are they going to use this as some  sort of weapon to slander or to, you know, smear mud against MSNBC, which clearly they're  taking advantage of it right now.  And Imus is the one that's getting the pressure.  That's why I think it's all from the TV side.  If he always said that on, you know, WFAN, I just don't see the pressure being what it  is.  I really don't.  Has any black people, besides our own sweet Patrice, has any black people on the shows  said this is ridiculous that anybody cares about this?  It was a little silly what he said back. 
[03:05:00]  He said he was sorry.  Let's move on.  Has any black people taken a rational course or are they all just running around trying  to make up for 400 years of disgusting behavior with one older gentleman in the cowboy hat  statement?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I mean, we're a little we're a little more removed from it because we actually fall into  the HBO side of things because we're a pay service, you know, and when you're free  over the air, you're certainly a far more vulnerable to things like that.  I mean, for God's sake, turn on Channel 150 and listen to that for an hour and then let  me know if what Don Imus said is that offensive. 
[03:05:30]  What's 150?  That's XM Comedy.  Oh, okay.  Great.  Black Station or something.  Thanks for telling our whole audience to go somewhere else.  Yeah, exactly.  That's all right.  You got to go around.  That's wonderful.  I think you can't have it.  Are we doing well on XM, Eric, really?  Yeah, it'd be great.  Number one show.  Number one channel.  Come on.  Nice.  You're just saying that.  I'm telling you.  Thank you.  Are we bigger than the 60s channel?  The Beatles.  Are you bigger than the Beatles?  Yes.  Yes.  You're bigger than the Beatles.  Are we bigger than...  If you're number one, Jim, you're bigger than all of them.  Okay.  The number one? 
[03:06:00]  The number one.  Are we bigger than Howard 100?  I don't know.  I haven't seen their ratings.  That's good enough to be treated to bleacher seats, right?  That's right.  Brings it right back around.  Glad we're not number two.  He would have fucking handed you a whole radio and sent you to the parking lot.  I don't know, Opie.  Number two, I'm a hot dog vendor.  Well, the problem is you picked the wrong New York team.  You see, if you would have picked the Yankees, you would have had better seats.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  The Metropolitan should have provided better seats for Greg Raleigh.  Now, I'll get my own tickets.  It's okay. 
[03:06:30]  That's what he wanted.  You have three.  Everybody else had two.  Well, yeah.  Three horrible seats make up for two good ones.  Yeah, there were plenty of them available.  Where'd you get it?  He probably went on eBay.  Well, that was a good joke.  That didn't even deserve a car crash.  Oh, he's doing his hand bill.  Wow.  Me and Elo were just crashing cars.  It was just a nothing.  He probably went on eBay.  What did I expect from that?  A fucking standing ovation?  I should lose my right to talk for an hour. 
[03:07:00]  He went on eBay.  Where'd you go, folks?  Get it?  Just bought bad tickets.  Be careful.  eBay's going to call.  They're going to be offended.  Yeah, let me apologize to all people who have sold bad tickets on eBay.  I think it meant well.  That's right.  eBay.  All right, Elo.  Everything else is good with you?  Things are great.  Things are great.  Life is good.  A-Lo.  Very good.  Good to hear you.  We'll talk soon, I hope, about that raise.  I appreciate it.  Anytime, Jimmy.  Godspeed.  All right.  There he goes.  Eric's a good one.  Don't know.  He slammed up the phone a little harder.  Oh, he's a good boy. 
[03:07:30]  Elo's a f***ed lover.  No shit.  And that was actually, he said, I threw Anthony's lips.  It said, serious.  Yeah.  Let's go to James in Cleveland.  James?  What's up, guys?  Hi, James.  Hey, it wasn't the big deal, and I'm a black guy to listen to your show, okay?  And I got the other end of Patrice.  Black guy, house or field?  Let's put it like this.  Look, field, work the house.  Ah, okay.  That's right.  He answered the question. 
[03:08:00]  That's why he's a fan of the show.  Thanks, James.  For having a sense of humor.  I'm a slight fan of the show.  Put it like this.  Wait, wait.  A slight fan?  Hold on.  That comment.  Oh, all right.  He had to drop his status down a little bit.  Go ahead, James.  I'm sorry.  No, it ain't that everybody pissed that he called them Jigaboos and Wannabes, because  that is a Spike Lee reference.  But what he did, he called a bunch of kids some nappy-head hos with tattoos.  That's rude.  I mean, if that was my daughter, I would be pissed. 
[03:08:30]  James, hold on.  They were Rutgers students.  I could almost see if they were like grade school, but they were Rutgers.  They're college.  They're all adults.  I think they're used to taking shit out on the court.  They probably have shit yelled at them.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  I was saying they probably are used to it and have shit yelled at them as they're playing.  You know, it's not new to these girls.  See, if, I mean, I ain't crazy about Imit, but when he said the Jigboos thing, that impressed  me at all.  But I have a daughter in college, and if he called her a nappy-head hoe with a tattoo, that's 
[03:09:00]  what pissed people off.  Should he get fired for that?  No, I think, you know what?  I think it'll, I think it's a sincere apology.  Now, don't, don't try to fucking apologize because you're scared now, and you don't want  to get thrown off the radio or lose your show or whatever.  I don't know where, I don't know where it comes from, but it looks like he's sincere  about his apology.  Well, then shouldn't there be five parents that are, like, pissed off at this whole thing  instead of an entire community? 
[03:09:30]  You're saying, like, if somebody called your daughter a nappy-headed hoe, you'd be pissed.  Uh, so shouldn't it be like a few family members maybe angry at this whole thing, and it's  blown up into this entire black against white thing again?  Here we go.  What I read in the...  No, you want to take...  Check this out, Anthony.  I don't think it's black against white.  I'm a black man.  But I'm not mad at you and Opie and Jim.  Thank you.  I'm mad at the white guy that said it.  You know, I don't...  Just because he said it, I'm not pissed at the whole white nation. 
[03:10:00]  How do you black people do that?  I'm pissed at one white guy.  To learn how to do that.  Well, why be mad when you know, like, here's the thing.  A, like, if they were high school students, like, freshman high school students, 14,  15, I would probably agree with you on that.  But they're adults.  They are adults.  College is adults.  Most of them are old enough to get the death penalty.  They're over 18.  They're old enough to be in the military.  And he wasn't saying it to be hateful.  He laughed when he said it.  And then Bernard is one that said,  Jigaboos and wannabes, which we all know is from school days.  So it was so harmless and so not intended to be vicious. 
[03:10:30]  And intent means a lot.  We all know intent is everything in the law.  Why would people be offended by this?  It's almost like people just want to jump on because they can't.  No, I'll be honest with you, man.  Look, I'm just telling you like this.  But when he would call some young black kids or young black girls a bunch of nappy-haired hoes with tattoos,  I'm serious, man.  If I was in a bar and I'm sitting down with a bunch of guys, white guys and black guys,  and one of them said the Rucker team looked like a bunch of nappy-haired hoes, 
[03:11:00]  I think, you know what it is?  It might be the nappy-haired thing.  Because that's specifically directed towards a race of people.  Yes, black people say it all the time as a goof, not to be vicious.  Like, you nappy-headed, I mean, you know, as well as I do.  Yeah, but that's different.  That's different.  Why?  If I call my brother, let me specifically clear.  If I call my brother, literally my brother, if I call him a punk-ass bitch, he might laugh.  But if we out somewhere and somebody else call him a punk-ass bitch, that's different. 
[03:11:30]  Understandable.  If I say she a nappy-haired and I'm sitting up here with a nappy-haired, it's kind of all right.  But if you're an old white guy with a big, stupid-ass cowboy hat on and you call somebody a nappy-haired ho, it's totally different.  And you should know this.  Are you comfortable with, so you're saying that there are certain things that black people can say that white people shouldn't be able to get away with.  Now, let me ask you, on the flip side, what are at least one example of something that white people should be able to say that black people should be publicly scolded or fired for saying? 
[03:12:00]  Well, the reason, I don't think.  Stick them up?  Well, I can't come up with something like that.  Please, of course.  The reason is, the reason is, y'all made up all this shit.  You made up the word nigger.  We didn't make it up.  Dude, that's, you're talking, again.  I wish I made it up.  I didn't make it up.  I'd love to patent that one.  Somebody else did many years ago.  No, no, but the point I'm making is not 400 years of problems.  I'm talking about things that are said in humor today where people know the intent of them.  I'm not talking about someone yelling nigger in some hateful, awful, repressive way. 
[03:12:30]  You know that.  There's a difference.  And you know there's a difference.  Right.  So what I'm saying is, is there anything, is nappy-headed, has nothing to do with the word nigger?  They're totally different things.  And it was said to be silly.  So what should black people not be able to say that should be allowed by the white community?  Since black people obviously have a few words now.  It's not just nigger.  It's nappy-headed.  And apparently, it's a few other things.  As a white guy, is there anything a black guy or a black person could say that would upset you being a white guy? 
[03:13:00]  I just bought the house next door.  I want to marry your daughter.  Hello.  Hello, Dad.  There you go again, man.  No, there's really not.  There you go again.  Come on, those were good lines.  They're just good lines, sir.  There you go again.  Jimmy, Jimmy, I'm going to give you some credit on that one.  That one was funny.  I'm going to give you some credit on that one.  James is kind of laughing.  He's laughing.  You can hear it.  But no, no, James, if black people said anything like that was trashing white people for real,  of course it would bother me.  But I don't think they should not be allowed to say it. 
[03:13:30]  Okay, check this out.  If somebody said to you, look at that nappy hair right there, before you even turned right to look at it,  what would you imagine that person to look like?  That they're black with nappy shitty hair.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  He was directing that towards just black people in general.  It was rude.  It was rude.  I like that nappy's coming back myself.  I do, too.  Yeah, but how about this?  I'm loving that nappy's coming back.  I got to take a nappy.  I'm so tired today.  Sweetie. 
[03:14:00]  What a nappy.  All right.  Come on, man.  By the way, Mark from the Bronx, great line by Anthony.  Got to learn how you black people do that.  Oh, okay.  Just wanting to know.  All right, now wait.  Now I know I'll get stumped for this, but you want to hear it well.  I hate all white people.  Why?  What's that?  Yes.  You ready for it?  Yeah.  All right, I say I'm kind of a fan because you, I mean, I used to listen to Howard, all right?  Then I brought a vehicle that had XM and started listening to you guys.  To me, your show is entertaining, very entertaining, but it's not funny. 
[03:14:30]  But you guys try to make it, you try to make it be funny.  Let me give you an example.  Wait, our show's not funny?  All right, let's see.  Let's see what he says.  It's entertaining.  I want to hear the example.  It's very entertaining and most, I would say, summertime is funny.  Okay.  But did you let you...  But you try to, instead of ignoring jokes, when somebody comes on the radio and just  cracker, just a fucking badass joke, instead of ignoring it, you guys take your time to 
[03:15:00]  point it out.  Just fucking move on.  Fuck the whole line of the day.  We know what the fuck was funny.  Well, no.  That ain't makes a good point.  No, he doesn't because I'll tell you one thing.  The reason pointing out stuff that's not funny, it is kind of different than what other people  do and it's just the way we address humor and there's an honesty in that and a silliness  in that and it's kind of fun to break your friend's balls about it.  That's kind of what we're doing with that.  Yeah, that is the reason we do that.  Okay.  Now, you're going to hate me for this comment.  I will tell you how to make the show better. 
[03:15:30]  All right.  You're going to hate me for this, all right?  All right?  First of all, Jim Norton on the show is kind of entertaining, but his stand-up is very fucking  entertaining.  Thank you.  But Trace, on the other hand, is the total opposite.  Funny as hell on the show and his stand-up is some weak-ass, wannabes, trying to be brother  shit.  This is how you change the show.  This is how you change the show.  You have Patrice, Jimmy, and Anthony. 
[03:16:00]  And get rid of opi's, opi's, blonde-haired, wannabe.  You're too white.  See?  Opi's.  So that's racially insensitive.  But James...  James, that's racially insensitive.  I don't like the way you want to bring a black in and kick a white out.  That's the part I have a problem with.  What happened?  Oh, but you want to change something?  Jim, check this out.  I wouldn't even think about paying to see Patrice stand-up, but I would definitely pay  to see yours.  Patrice is a really good stand-up.  I think it's funny you call him a fake brother when he's actually a really good comic.  He's not a fake brother at all. 
[03:16:30]  Patrice is kind of a militant jizz bucket.  I mean, you don't know him.  I know him for years.  Your assessment is wrong.  I bet you 75% of the people that like Patrice are white and not black.  I don't know about that.  I honestly, I don't know about that.  And I think black people love Patrice.  Are you kidding me?  He's a funny guy.  Black people...  He's funny on radio.  He is funny because he has a different perspective to where he's like, I didn't even think of that  shit.  And it's funny.  But on his stand-up, man, it's weak. 
[03:17:00]  Thank God, it's weak.  You might have seen him have a bad set somewhere.  But I think you're...  I don't know.  I mean, that's your opinion on it, but I think you're wrong.  Besides Jimmy, who else do you find funny on stage?  On stage?  Yeah.  Stand-up.  Anything?  Why should it be like really comics I hate?  I know.  That's what we're all hoping.  I like that carrot top guy.  Gallagher.  Gallagher's funny and shit.  What it is about Jimmy...  I don't know.  I can't...  You know, I know him by face.  I don't really know him by name. 
[03:17:30]  But what's funny about Jimmy is Jimmy just bring up shit that you would never even think  about, and then once you bring it to mind, it's humor.  It's very funny.  And he's saying some shit that, you know, people think, but you would never want to say.  It's just funny.  He has very good stand-up.  But on the show, the reason I don't like him on the show, or I mean, I don't like him...  All right, James, wrap up.  Wrap up.  You hurt everybody around you, so let's wrap up.  Okay, go ahead.  The only reason I don't like him on the show is because sometimes he just... 
[03:18:00]  He just too much...  He just hating too much.  Hating who, though?  I mean, just lighten up somewhat.  But, Opie, I didn't mean to slam you.  I mean, you keep the show moving.  You do.  But, Anthony, you're always on point with little funny jokes, even when you crack like  jokes.  Oh, look at that.  I hate you, but I'm laughing.  Even the **** like me.  But I was...  I love it.  How can you say I'm hateful?  I think you and I had a nice discussion.  I think I didn't jump all over you.  I listened to your point.  I agreed with some.  I disagreed with other parts.  Is it good?  No, not with me.  But, like, when you crack on fat hoes. 
[03:18:30]  All right, James, you've done a lot of damage today.  Why don't you just go?  We're going to spend the next hour recovering.  We're going to be sad.  Now we're going to have to recoup.  You made us all sad for today.  Hey, let me close with this.  You're a very entertaining show, and I'm going to keep listening.  All right.  Thank you, boy.  All right, James.  All right, man.  All right, man.  Let's go to David in...  Davis in Florida.  Davis.  What's up, guys?  Love you.  Love the show.  Jimmy, you're great.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on.  Dan from Toronto.  You know what would make things funnier?  Lose this **** caller. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, I don't know.  That's helpful.  Dan from Toronto, Canada.  Very good, Dan.  Where are we?  Yeah, Davis, go ahead.  I just wanted to let y'all know that y'all Slave Girl bit from Friday, me and my girlfriend  listen religiously.  We took that **** home with us, and we just had a great time all weekend long.  Wait, you played Slave Girl at home?  The home version?  Oh, hell yeah.  Is there a black and white relationship here?  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  Wait, wait.  Let me listen to your voice.  Talk a little more.  Talk a little more?  Yes.  I'm the white one in the relationship. 
[03:19:30]  I was going to...  We were going to guess that.  That's why I wanted you to just talk.  Let me see if we could have guessed that.  What time do you start work in the morning?  I start at...  That's all you got to say.  Yeah, white.  All right, guys.  I just want to apologize for Jim Norton.  I apologize.  I'm very mad, Dom.  You can't just hang up after that.  How did you play Slave Girl?  Tell us what did you do.  We took a couple things as far as the one suggestion about the cotton balls that y'all had. 
[03:20:00]  We did that.  Yeah, we had a few suggestions before.  You actually made her pick up cotton all weekend?  No, not all weekend.  Just one of the things that we did was I had her stripped down to bra and panties and pick up cotton while I smacked her ass.  Yeah, a couple of suggestions for the scenario that didn't quite pan out.  One of which was to get a bunch of cotton balls from the drugstore and spread them out on the floor and have her in bra and panties, picking them up as we whack her ass. 
[03:20:30]  Weren't you looking at each other laughing, though?  Like, how do you...  Oh, yeah.  We were having a great time.  The whole thing is she gets excited with the whole ass-smacking thing.  So, like, just me smacking her ass after, you know, a little while, she starts, like, coming in her panties and shit.  Well, we're recruiting more Slave Girls.  Would you be up for it?  Possibly.  We really want to get another Slave Girl in here.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, Davis.  All right.  No problem.  Punch it out.  All right. 
[03:21:00]  We'll take another break.  Yeah, I'm sad.  We're all sad today.  It says CBS fire...  I'm reading message board stuff.  It says CBS fired Jimmy the Greek for saying less than Imus.  Wait, what?  Jimmy the Greek...  Yeah, well, they were wrong to fire him.  They were...  And first of all, they fired him...  I think one of the reasons was he didn't say it in humor.  He's not...  You know, that's not part of his job.  Exactly.  And they were wrong to fire him.  Because he was telling probably the truth.  Even though it was an uncomfortable truth, you know, giving out barbaric stuff like that 
[03:21:30]  is probably a little different.  Yeah.  I don't think Jimmy the Greeks was based on any kind of...  Like you said, there was no humor in it.  So then you have to look for some kind of fact.  And I don't think...  I think that was his assumptions based on what was probable.  But the way he put it was so bad.  Yeah, he wasn't good.  It's hard to mention breeding a group of people who were slaves.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, good for Monday Night Football.  It kind of made him sound, you know, like animals and stuff.  So that's where he got fired.  But Imus, it was pure humor.  It's ridiculous that he's fucking apologizing as much and for as many things. 
[03:22:00]  And going on Al Sharpton's show and giving him some fucking heat.  And then thanking Sharpton.  And thanking the same guy that accused Stephen Pagonis, the prosecutor, of raping Tawana Brawley.  That same shitbag thanking that motherfucker for letting you go on is disgraceful.  Sharpton is a cunt.  Yep.  He is.  And that should be his opponent's platform. 
[03:22:30]  Sharpton is a cunt.  And they all started holding signs with a picture of Sharpton and an equals and a cunt.  All wrong.  All right, let's get out of here for a little bit.  We'll be back in a bit.  The current it voice of FM Talk are the New York-based duo of Opie and Anthony.  And the talk is racy and raw at times, pushing the limits as far as they can.  Show your hairy pork chop.  My mother smokes crack rocks.  I'm for drunk teens.  What are you kidding?  How about I lay down and give you a little buccacke? 
[03:23:00]  We laugh.  We're going to have a disgusting body fluid blowout.  Skateboard.  Bow.  Hey, could you soap up your bad place?  The slutty or the better.  I would definitely be going to have sex with you if we both already had AIDS.  It's certainly not your father's talk radio.  All right, we've got a studio audience out there. 
[03:23:30]  And E-Rock kind of asked them about what they're all about.  And, uh, nothing good today.  No, we've got quite a few people out there.  How could it be nothing good?  Nothing really good today.  You want to take a look?  Yeah, let me take a look.  There's actually a guy who's in the hotel across the way, though.  Yeah, his hotel room is literally, like, right across the street.  Ooh.  The same level as the hotel.  Same level as the studio here.  Uh, yeah. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, yeah?  Well, that's kind of interesting.  Which one's interesting?  The first one?  Because those videos are, you know, all the rage.  All right.  Not as big as the, um, the otters holding hands video.  Wow.  Number one most viewed animal video on YouTube.  The stupid otters floating on their back holding, uh, hands.  Is one of them Bob Kelly?  Stupid otter face he has.  Hold my otter hands. 
[03:24:30]  Hold my otter hands.  Hold my flipper.  Oh, but that video's adorable.  Uh, let's see.  It's, um, uh, uh, let's see.  Ladies are lawyers.  Their kids, uh, high school made, oh, their kids high school made national news for some  fight video.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Then we have a guy that works for Pepsi.  Doesn't like seeing Jim drinking Diet Coke.  Boy, you guys are really into his fucking job.  All these people out here? 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, I guess so.  I had no idea what you were talking about.  I was just randomly babbling about people I know.  Who's the Pepsi guy?  And MySpace profiles.  Oh, Jimmy just threw it away.  That's right.  Wow.  That's good.  Helping him out.  And then we have a physical therapist.  Oh, boy.  That's got to be exciting.  That's Barry from Westchester.  That's a guy.  Very good.  Yes, Moby.  You hear that all the time, though.  I know, right?  Yeah, I haven't heard that one before.  Oh, Michael Stipes.  That's why I said that.  What do the broads do? 
[03:25:30]  Do we cover them?  No offense.  Yeah, that was the first thing.  I was talking about what you're doing.  I was coming in.  I didn't realize you were back on.  I was arguing with my girlfriend who's in Georgia.  Why is she in Georgia?  She's something about a threesome.  Oh.  I'm just kidding.  Tee.  We have Jeff from Queens.  He works for the Hard Rock and has a comment on the guy from last week who watches Opie  in the park.  That's kind of creepy.  What's the comment?  Yell it out.  He just follows you around the park every day. 
[03:26:00]  Couldn't hear you.  He just follows you around the park every day.  Oh, that's wonderful.  He brought it up in here and, yeah.  Great.  That's just wonderful.  We have Rob, who is an ICU nurse.  Uh-oh.  Which one's Rob?  A lot of old people die on your shift, don't they?  Yeah.  Where is...  Let me see the angel of death.  Where is it?  He really wants to...  Oh, look at this guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Huh?  How do you think I met my wife?  You know, the ex-patient died.  Okay.  Wow. 
[03:26:30]  What?  That was great.  But what?  Dominic, Uncle Junior's kid got a bigger laugh from Frank Vincent on the episode.  Way to amend it quickly.  All right.  So what happened?  That's how you met your wife?  No, no, no.  Okay.  No, he's totally tripping.  I don't know.  I've heard...  I was performing in this show, and I basically stripped down to my underwear, and that's  how I met her.  Really?  Huh.  Yeah.  Why'd you strip down?  I was performing...  No, you know the Rocky Horror Picture Show?  Sure.  I was performing in that, and my character required me to get...  Mm-hmm. 
[03:27:00]  Jimmy puts down the blinds in the middle of him talking, so we've lost visual contact with  the audience.  You go to the Rocky Horror movie?  I haven't done it in a few years.  I haven't done it in a few years, but...  A few years.  But you would go, and you would act it out and do things.  What character would you play?  She was Frankenfurter, the girl he fell in love with.  At that time, I was performing Rocky.  Uh-huh.  Wow.  Now, down to the gold boxers and all that.  Right, so you'd have to be kind of naked.  Yeah. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  Oh.  That's kind of creepy.  And then being a nurse is even creepier.  Oh, yeah.  How'd you do that?  The whole schooling thing, and you wanted to be a nurse, or what happened?  Yeah, it was just...  Well, I started out, I was doing, like, EMS work, and I just progressed from there.  Yeah.  A nurse, so...  Progressed from there.  No, I'll just get...  I guess that's about it for the studio audience.  Ben's old lady knows it.  Elementary school teacher, local news reporter, has done articles on O&A, and Jimmy.  Let's be nice to them.  Where is this wonderful person?  Jermaine, Orange County. 
[03:28:00]  Hello, Jermaine.  Oh, yeah, you're up by Poughkeepsie, right?  What was the last article you wrote on us?  Opie and Anthony.  I was actually the one who found Louis C.K.'s dates.  And, uh, do the article, so...  Why did you have to do the article?  It's my job, man.  I got a world exclusive, and I'm a fan.  But you're a fan of the show first.  I know, but I...  But you think that would hurt us a little bit.  Could have talked to us.  We would have given you, like, that, maybe before everyone else, and then some other  exclusive on...  I didn't mean to screw you guys, honestly.  I was just, like...  Homosexuality.  I was so excited, you know?  Homosexual.  And everybody's so excited about the dates, you know, so... 
[03:28:30]  Wait, who told you, though?  I was on...  I was just...  I saw a bulletin on Louis C.K.'s MySpace.  I was just looking for dates, and I was like, holy crap.  So you got a fucking rat.  You found gold, my friend.  I did.  Because that's what...  He went on the internet to try to find the dates, and he got them.  Ahead of everyone else.  Yeah, I mean, like I said, I didn't...  I think four of the dates were leaked out out of about ten.  Ten.  Yeah.  That's all right.  He's very good to watch those guys.  He took them down, and I've, you know, dropped it there.  Because, like I said, now you guys got the press.  Yeah, he dropped that after it came out in print.  That's all right. 
[03:29:00]  Who, uh...  Good, thanks.  Great.  Honestly, I don't give a shit, to be totally honest with you.  I was nervous.  Like I said, I didn't want to get smashed on air.  Nah, trust me, it's fine.  All right.  No, who cared was Pete.  Yeah.  Even Pete I talked to.  Pete's over it.  Yeah, Pete's over it.  Pete's a queer.  Yeah, sure is.  Everyone knows that.  He's from Mary.  Who brought the young lad?  Whose young lad is that?  Well, that's the fight video, or the...  Right?  You go to the school with the famous fight video, I'm assuming?  Yeah, that's my school.  Oh, that's your...  Yeah. 
[03:29:30]  What's your name?  Jonah.  You guys are from Wisconsin?  Yeah.  Milwaukee?  Yep.  Wow, what are you doing in New York?  Visiting relatives.  All right.  Sometimes people go visiting you guys, and we feel really sorry for you that you're watching  this shit.  Come all the way here and watch this.  Are you, uh, uh, because she looks a little young to be hearing some of this language.  How old are you?  I'm 14.  You're 14, young lad, and where's mommy?  That's your mommy.  Wait, how come two people held up their hands? 
[03:30:00]  You got two mommies?  Yeah.  Is that an alternative relationship?  Uh, yeah.  Wow, really?  Aw.  I was kidding.  That's pretty interesting.  That's adorable.  Oh, wait.  See, that's the get today.  Yeah, see?  I thought you guys were kidding.  Okay, so you, uh, no, where's your dad?  Uh, we don't have one.  Oh, yeah?  Were you adopted?  Uh, pretty much.  So wait.  Pretty much.  Pretty much.  Well.  Are you guys willing to talk about this a little bit or no?  This is interesting, yeah.  This is interesting.  This is something you don't see every day. 
[03:30:30]  They can talk.  I'm not really good at this.  All right.  Go to mom over there.  One of them.  I've never met a family that has two mommies.  This is the coolest thing ever.  How hot.  So, give us the quick story.  Um, I gave birth to them, and then my partner, Ruth, adopted them.  So.  But what happened to the guy?  It was artificial insemination.  Oh.  Nice.  So you two were hooked up.  You wanted kids.  How long have you guys been hooked up?  23 years. 
[03:31:00]  Holy.  Wow.  Sinners.  I couldn't remember.  Sinners.  Sinners.  So then you decided to have kids, so you got artificially inseminated.  Right.  Well, that's interesting.  What did you pick?  Like, do you get to pick from, like, smart or brawny or blonde or?  Yeah, they do have sort of a catalog.  Yeah?  So what did you pick?  What do these kids got going for them?  It wasn't the dentist.  The dentists were on every month, and we didn't pick them.  The dentists who played tennis, there were two of them, and they were on every month. 
[03:31:30]  What do you mean on?  You get a list.  Oh, wow.  It took a few months.  So you see the same stupid dentist, you're like, I don't want his sperm?  I bet you shoot right by the D so you don't grab Down syndrome by accident.  You're A, B, C, E.  So then what did you choose?  People who sounded interesting.  No, I know, but you mentioned it.  You don't want him to know?  Oh, you don't really want him to know?  Let me ask you a question.  It's not the kind of discussion you have for the first time with your child on the radio live. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  What's his name?  Interesting, though.  Ari.  Ari, do you get curious, Ari?  Not really.  I just try to stay away from that issue.  Yeah.  What kind of problems do you guys have in school because of this?  Oh, no.  They're pretty cool?  Yeah.  Kids aren't assholes.  Yeah, they're all staying and stuff, yeah.  Because sometimes kids can be douchebags.  Yeah, because kids in general are douchebags.  Yeah.  You would think you would give them an easy one to make fun of.  Yeah, you'd think I'd get more of it, but no, nothing really. 
[03:32:30]  Has it affected your life in any way that would have been different if you had a regular  mom and dad?  I don't think so.  No?  This is all I know, so this is just life.  I don't know anything else.  A lot of critics, they go, oh, well, if a lesbian couple or a gay man couple raise  kids, they're going to turn out to be gay.  Do you like girls?  Yeah.  Yeah, see?  Yeah, I have a girlfriend.  That's crap.  That's kind of a bad example, though, because they're lesbians.  If they were gay, it might be a better example because they're girls.  No, it's all the same. 
[03:33:00]  They're sinners.  That's right.  What would God think, you raising children healthily?  Yeah, right, exactly.  Yeah, look, good-looking, well-adjusted children.  That's horrible.  And so what grade are you in?  I'm a senior in high school.  Oh, cool.  What do you want to be?  It would be funny if you said I just want to torture small animals.  Possibly engineer.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  Do you have any male influences in your life?  Any relatives that are good?  I'm like grandpa and my uncle.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And are they married? 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  Teasing, of course.  But they do, like, guy things with you?  Yeah.  Although, I'll tell you, the one on the right could probably do guy things with you, too.  Jesus.  What does that mean?  I mean, she looks like the guy in the relationship, right?  No, that's not nice.  That's not the guy.  Which one's the guy?  What's wrong with you?  Which one's more the guy?  They're both lovely ladies, Anthony.  They find that to be offensive, right?  Is that like, gay guys have said they hate when you say which one is the woman?  Yeah, but you know.  Oh, good point.  I'm just saying.  No, I'm teasing, of course.  Well, maybe they don't want to share that info.  Why don't you try again, Anthony?  Yeah. 
[03:34:00]  Or one that represents the male figure more than the female one in the relationship.  There's got to be, like, an alpha in the relationship.  I'm better at fixing things that go wrong in the house.  Okay.  So you're playing catch with the boys.  No, she plays catch with the boys.  Oh, my God.  Now we're all confused.  Wow.  You're the one that should be playing catch, it seems.  All right.  All right.  I just think if there's one thing, women can teach boys probably almost anything a man can,  but throwing a ball is not one.  No, that is not one.  You don't want to throw like a girl. 
[03:34:30]  We should make these guys throw a baseball, and we'll critique their form.  Wouldn't that be hysterical if they both just threw like a complete girl?  Get the Rana Fez balls.  We want to see if the two mommies.  It's baseball season.  We want to see if the two mommies brought up the boys the correct way as far as throwing  a baseball.  As far as throwing a baseball.  They seem to be well-adjusted young men.  Yeah.  By the way, shame on the two women there, the two mommies, for not sharing when E-Rock came  around with the little paper.  Yeah.  I thought we had a boring audience today.  This is the get.  And we're not going to beat you up.  We disclosed. 
[03:35:00]  He just didn't get it.  Oh, my God.  Stupid E-Rock.  E-Rock, you are an idiot.  How'd you disclose to him if someone can...  Hold on.  Sam, how'd you disclose?  He said that these were our two children, and then he tried to say, well, which one was  hers and which one was mine?  And I said, no, they're both of our children.  And E-Rock didn't pick up...  So, E-Rock, people are starting to think you were raised by two chimpanzees because of  your stupidity.  How did you get that...  Let that slip by you?  I wasn't exactly sure, so I just wrote down, you know, these two brought their kids. 
[03:35:30]  Why don't you ask a follow-up question?  Like, how is that possible that they're both your kids?  Did you not see the haircuts?  Isn't there a way you could, like, maybe want to get more info?  I could have, yes.  Holy shit, E-Rock.  Why didn't you?  Too busy on wrestling sites, you homoerotic nothing?  Instead, we got some boring story that had something to do with them.  I guess the better one was stairs at studio from hotel room across street. 
[03:36:00]  Room is level with his studio.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Stop the show.  Wow.  Do nothing else until we talk to that studio member.  Oh, and by the way, I think there's a couple out here with two women that had artificial  insemination and had two of these kids.  We hear the stories every once in a while, but we've never met anybody.  Did you both have one of the kids?  No, I have both of them.  You have both?  You made her do all the heavy lifting.  Yeah.  Why was that?  You want one?  Maybe you don't want to show that.  I was ready. 
[03:36:30]  I wanted to do it.  Yeah.  She's younger.  Ah.  All right.  So you just sat around watching the game with your hand down your pants.  You did all the work.  I hear you.  Somebody had to do it.  Yeah.  A question to the two mommies.  How do your parents feel about this whole thing?  If they're alive, I don't know, but were they cool?  Both of our parents are alive.  Um, when I told them that I was going to have a kid, they, uh, were very, when my father  was really excited and, uh, it took them a while to adjust, but they are fine now. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  They're really fine.  Wow.  This is really interesting.  You watch The Wire.  There's a great one.  One of the cops is a lesbian and she was dating another girl and they had, they wanted to  date artificial insemination.  And then the one, uh, who was the cop didn't really want the kid anymore.  It was, uh, obviously it didn't happen with you guys, but.  Jesus.  No, it didn't.  I mean.  Make them feel bad.  No, these are, these are grown up kids.  These, I'm talking about when it was a baby.  Ah.  I just want to talk about The Wire again.  Are the kids willing to throw the, uh, the mock baseball?  Yeah. 
[03:37:30]  Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, yeah.  All right.  Who gets to throw?  Do you get to throw with mom or what?  High school.  All right.  Have a little catch between each other.  All right.  We got to be able to see.  Can you see over there?  How about, uh.  We wanted to make sure the mommies, uh, did the right thing and told them how to throw  a baseball the right way.  All right.  All right.  Well, the other ones.  All right.  All right.  He's a little.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, that's a little.  I think maybe the uncle ought to throw a ball around with you for a little while.  No.  They're doing fine.  Yeah. 
[03:38:00]  It's so easy to go for.  Well, you can't see on the radio, but the one, he's, he's holding it and he's like using  both hands and he's throwing it like a scoop.  And after he throws it, it claps.  And then, no, that's normal.  Yeah.  That was always the big question with like gay couples.  It's like, all right, well, I have no problem with it, but does it affect the kids?  Because I knew a dude in high school, his dad was gay and had a roommate and the kids  were pretty brutal.  I mean, that's obviously many years ago.  Yeah.  Well, straight couples have screwed up kids.  Most, most of the screwed up kids out there are from straight couples. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah, that's true.  Let's, uh, let's say hi to Tonto, the trucker.  Tonto.  Doug.  Yo, hey guys.  Hey, Tonto.  Good evening.  Just want to know if he looks like a David Crosby and if he plays guitar.  Do you guys play guitar?  I don't think they're David Crosby's kids.  They're not David Crosby's kids.  All right.  How can we be sure?  Well, we ask.  What else can we do?  That's pretty cool.  All right.  I don't know what other questions to ask.  It's just very interesting.  Are you all fans of the show? 
[03:39:00]  Hold up your hands.  These four.  No, uh, uh, uh, uh, reddish hair, mommy.  Hold up your hands.  The other one.  The other hand?  Yeah, I'd love to ask how that happened, but the kids are here.  Oh, my God.  She's got a little brace on her thumb.  Oh, no.  The other one's on crutches.  Hey, all the kids enjoy the humor.  Oh, man.  We're just having a little fun.  So, who's the fan out there?  I think it's great.  You're the fan?  Moms? 
[03:39:30]  Not fans?  Have no clue?  Sort of fan?  Moms have accepted it.  We listen, Ron, when I take Jonah's school in the morning.  We listen.  Oh, cool.  I bet you these kids are raised much better than most kids out there.  Yeah.  Are we nicer than you thought we'd be in person?  Aren't we sweet and handsome?  We're horrid.  Horrid humans.  And smarter, too.  Don't I look slimmer than you thought I would?  That, too.  All right.  Well, that's cool.  Very interesting.  You guys survived, so we didn't.  We didn't beat you up too bad, right?  I think that's pretty cool, man.  No, it is.  The little guy, all right? 
[03:40:00]  You all right?  Yeah.  Things good?  Are you a fan of the show?  Oh, yeah.  I like it.  Sort of?  Mm-hmm.  All these religious people that are complaining about gay couples, and they're not doing shit  to help.  And here, all these couples want to adopt kids.  Yeah.  Stupid Angelina Jolie's got to go over to whatever, Timbuktu, to grab something, stick it on her  shoulder, collecting.  Fucking here.  Put a red hat on it.  I'll hold this lantern in front of your house, stupid.  Hey, what do the boys call?  Do you call them both mom?  Yeah.  Mom one, mom two? 
[03:40:30]  Is there like a difference?  Yeah.  What if they're both upstairs?  And what if you need, say, the mom in the green shirt?  How would you differentiate by just yelling from downstairs?  Sometimes we just use their first names.  Okay.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  What about this?  Who's more like more of a disciplinarian?  Like, who would you, if you had to go to mom to maybe go to a school meeting or something  like that where you know you want the more lenient one, which one would you tell?  Probably Amy.  Yeah.  Which one's Amy? 
[03:41:00]  A black shirt.  Yeah?  Yeah.  A little more lenient.  Wait, why?  That is so weird you're calling her by her first name because there's a blood thing there,  too.  I mean, you guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or something like it's mom, Amy, or like mommy Amy.  That's a very Brady Bunch of you because there was a time when he grew up, he said  Mike and Carol.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, Mike, Carol.  Mike put a stop to that.  He certainly did.  Cried up his ass.  Way to say that and look down.  There's a family out there.  I was ashamed.  As you could have been.  Look, and I'm just reading this one.  It's coming in a lot.  Oh, no.  So, have you ever caught your mommy's maybe? 
[03:41:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Why would it be any different than a regular couple?  Hey, I remember the kid hearing some weird things through the door.  I'm just asking.  No.  Jeez.  You don't want to think that right.  Thank God.  What kid wants to think that?  Don't do that.  Oh, my God.  If you rummage through their night tables.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  The smorgasbord you'd find.  No.  I'm sure.  But never do.  Never do.  They're nice people.  I can't even look after you.  I know.  They are very nice people.  They're wholesome, good people. 
[03:42:00]  How, how, uh...  You guys have no idea how hard we're trying to behave here.  But I don't want...  Where do you guys meet?  Where do we do?  We're trying to show another side of us.  Yes, human.  A human side, which only comes out every once in a while.  We're trying so hard.  Where did you two meet 23 years ago?  Oh, that's good.  We work together.  Doing...  We're lawyers.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  What kind?  Criminal or civil?  Civil.  Yes.  We don't like lawyers, you know.  Two lawyers.  We like the two mommy thing, but we don't like lawyers. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah, what kind of lawyers?  I'm against lawyers getting married.  Having kids.  What were you guys doing as lawyers?  Unfortunately, we can't anyway.  Were you rifling through entertaining things and removing all the fun and humor?  That's what our lawyers do.  So you just brought up the fact that unfortunately you can't get married.  Would you if there was a place where you can get married?  Would you get married?  She keeps saying she's not the marrying kind.  No, huh?  So you wouldn't?  But I'd like the right to.  You've been together so long, yeah.  And, you know, things like health insurance, social security benefits, those are things 
[03:43:00]  that you get if you're married, and if you can't get married, you can't get the benefits.  Right.  So what about property and stuff?  I'm sorry, man.  Properties, stuff like you guys have to split everything 50-50, just so if one of you dies,  the other one keeps it.  I mean, how does that work?  Well, you have to do a lot of things by contract.  Yeah.  Wills and trusts.  Well, let me tell you something.  A lot smarter that way than just getting married and having a marriage certificate, take care  of all that stuff.  All your property, your money, how much you owe people in the future, you know, little 
[03:43:30]  things like that.  I think it's a lot smarter to sit down and write out a contract for everything, property,  cars, money, kids, everything, health insurance, all that stuff in separate contracts.  So in court, you go, here you go.  If you ever, you know, you guys are together for quite a while, you know, but if, you know,  a new couple gets together and doesn't like each other anymore, you know, it's a lot  easier if you just pull out these contracts.  That's what I say.  It's not interesting or funny.  It's just the way it is.  It was interesting, though.  It was a good point. 
[03:44:00]  But if you don't have a contract and a gay or lesbian couple splits up, then you don't  have the whole divorce law to provide some form for splitting up so it gets even uglier.  And I say thank God for that because divorce law is bunk.  That's what I say.  And I know from experience, ma'am.  You don't, now, because, listen, honestly, you don't think that I belong in your community  because I've had a few indiscretions with gentlemen in dresses, you know, who I didn't know were. 
[03:44:30]  He never knew.  If you call them indiscretions, then I'd say no.  So was the guy had a big back and Jimmy noticed but put it out of his head until things were  over.  Absolutely.  Because things were already happening.  Yeah.  So why stop at that point?  But they were so good.  Sometimes you got to take a cell number.  I mean, just to be courteous.  And if you get chafed on your inner thigh by beard stubble, it goes away in a day. 
[03:45:00]  It happens.  Either one of you men in the past or always women.  Oh, the one is nodding.  Oh, you gave her.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What?  Always a woman.  Always women for you.  You tried.  Wait.  She just gave you a look like, well, what about.  I don't know.  Well, wait a minute.  What's going on now?  I hope we break up this couple after 22 years.  Why are you saying something with the man?  Pardon?  No, she's had men. 
[03:45:30]  Oh, she's had men.  Oh, I see.  I see.  I never tried.  She did, too.  They thought you meant.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I'm getting at.  No, no, no.  I thought you were saying, was I ever a man?  Oh, no.  Oh, my goodness.  Have I ever been with men yet?  Oh, really?  What didn't you like about it?  Just.  It just wasn't who I am.  What can I say?  Boy, he must have been lousy.  Jesus.  Imagine that.  Watch they both recognize me and realize they slept with me independently. 
[03:46:00]  And what about you?  She's had a few men.  Yeah.  You can tell.  I decided that I fell in love with Ruth and wanted to spend my life.  It was more of that.  Were you bisexual growing up?  Pardon?  Were you bisexual growing up?  No.  Did you ever, like, do you ever, like, ever have cravings for a guy, like, in moments?  Like, wow, that'd be kind of nice.  I'm in, like, one of those moods right now.  Like, we all have, like, different things we enjoy.  Did you ever have one of those moments, like, even now?  Yeah.  Okay.  Ruth?  No. 
[03:46:30]  It's dick, Jim, not a Snickers bar.  I had a craving.  Yeah, but it's.  I got a hanker in for some cock.  Well, like a Snickers, it packs with peanuts.  I don't even know if that ties in or not.  It's the only Snickers slogan.  It didn't make sense to say you're blowing someone, not going anywhere for a while.  All right.  Way to go.  Jesus.  On the old display, it says lesbo parents.  Oh, because he couldn't spell.  That's why.  Because he couldn't spell lesbian.  He's L-E-S-B-Y-A-N. 
[03:47:00]  You don't spell woman, W-O-Y-M-N, right?  No.  No.  All right.  Very interesting.  Thanks for that.  Thank you.  Thank you, ladies.  Probably not an easy thing to do in front of the little guys.  The young lads.  A couple of nice kids there.  Especially the little fellow over there.  I know.  He just still thinks he's a Santa.  He doesn't know any better.  These all the kids you got?  The two?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah?  All right.  Just wondering.  Did you want a daughter or no?  Yes.  Oh, you did?  Of course you did.  But besides them.  Yeah.  In addition to it.  Yeah, right.  In addition to it.  Because that wouldn't give them a complex.  They have, you know, two two-day parents, and all of a sudden they wanted daughters. 
[03:47:30]  But no, we're fine.  That would be fine.  So why don't you have a daughter or adopt if you, you know?  I didn't want to stay up in the middle of the night anymore.  I was too old.  There you go.  She's done.  She's done.  Good for her.  Very good.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Coming from Milwaukee.  Yeah.  Thanks, Iraq.  Jesus.  Way to miss it.  God, if we didn't stumble across that.  It's awful.  It's funny.  Bin Laden's probably sitting out there yesterday.  Just waiting for someone to come up to him.  Hi, what did you do?  I plotted 9-11. 
[03:48:00]  I don't know.  He said he can only stay from 9 to 11.  He's into geology.  Hey, what the fuck is...  All right, we're going to get out of here.  Stupid Iraq.  His name is Alan Akbar.  I don't know.  Thanks, man.  Apparently lost the whole room on that one.  But fuck him.  That was funny.  Line of the day brought to you by Bodogfight.com.  They got an upcoming paper.  Clash of the nations.  Can I say something about DNA evidence?  Why is this? 
[03:48:30]  How about when you're born?  Now, the ACLU would scream about this.  Oh, yeah.  They wouldn't like this.  They take your DNA.  Meh, meh, wrong.  Couldn't do it.  They store it.  Mm-hmm.  The law says it's only...  These are lawyers.  The law says it's only allowed to be used to solve a missing persons case or something  that will help society to solve a violent crime, and not only would you catch rapists  because it's on file, but you would clear innocent people of certain crimes because the  DNA wouldn't match.  Why don't we just do that, and then within the next 20 years, we can have a DNA bank 
[03:49:00]  that clears people and helps catch people who are committing rapes and child crime.  Where is the downside of that?  Fringing on your rights.  But how?  Do you believe that the government is never going to lie to you about what they're going  to do?  Of course not.  But I also think that the government behaving a certain way, because things can be corrupt,  you have to stop it when it happens, because by that logic, you could say, well, because  innocent people are jailed, we shouldn't have jails.  I mean, just because the government are untrustworthy scumbags, then they have to be stopped when 
[03:49:30]  they do something they shouldn't be doing with it.  So the question then is, is the benefit of having that DNA a greater benefit than the risk  of all the things that the government could do with it if they misused it?  Good question.  What could they do with it that would outweigh catching rapists and stopping innocent people  for spending 20 years in jail for rape? 
[03:50:00]  Not even that, but say, missing persons, people don't know where their kids are, or whatever,  like all the things you could do, especially, I'm thinking mostly sex crimes and things like  that.  What could the detriments be that would outweigh that?  Figure out who has the gene for various types of illnesses and kill them all because it'll  drive up the cost of health care.  But I mean, if you can, in a way, no, you can't go out and just kill people, but I mean, 
[03:50:30]  if there's a way genetically to ensure that certain diseases don't happen or certain, like,  people aren't born deformed and stuff, is that a bad thing?  I mean, I don't mean you'd gather up retarded people and murder them, but is that a bad thing  to be able to do science to keep it?  Or how about somebody is an enemy of the state?  Some people, they used to have FBI files on them.  You take a little of that contributed DNA that they have, you put it at a crime scene,  now all of a sudden you're linked to it through DNA.  Absolutely.  And now you're going like, wait a minute, but I, hey, this is proof positive. 
[03:51:00]  We have your DNA, it's right here, you go to jail, you're done.  She didn't get that you were just being completely sarcastic.  Uh, no, actually, that's the truth.  Oh, really?  If I was sarcastic, I would be like, they could clone you, and then you'd be cloned in two  years of walking around.  Oh, you're saying, I thought you were joking, saying that was a good thing.  No, that, well, with some people it would be.  Oh, you're saying that's a bad thing?  The Jews.  Oh, you're saying it's a bad thing?  Oh, but David, they can still do that with blood.  If they don't do that with DNA, they can still do it with blood.  Yeah, but they have to have your blood.  What if you're an, what if you're deemed an undesirable? 
[03:51:30]  You've done no crimes, you haven't spilled any blood anywhere that they could scoop up,  but because of this law, they have your DNA on record.  Now, because of things you've written, things you've done, they don't like you.  All of a sudden, they plant a little of this DNA around a crime scene and go, we've collected  DNA.  Now we're going to match it with our files.  Here it is.  Oh, a perfect match with Jimmy Norton.  Would they actually have the DNA, though, or would they just have like a print or whatever  they need of it on a computer?  I'm thinking more it's going to be on computer as opposed to actual DNA.  I don't know how they map DNA and do it, but I think most of it's done with computer. 
[03:52:00]  I don't think you would need some kind of a sample.  But if they, you're right, they could use it to set up an enemy of the state, but if  the government wants to set you up for something, they don't have to wait.  So there's a lot of ways they could do it, and I don't think that catching rapists or  pedophiles or whatever would be outweighed by that, the possibility that they're going  to set up an unpopular author.  How come we haven't just fingerprinted everybody at some point in their life and get a fingerprint  file so that when no DNA is left but fingerprints, we can do that?  I completely agree with you.  And how about hair samples? 
[03:52:30]  We just give them hair because just in case hair falls somewhere, you could match that  up.  I'll tell you how.  Ear wax.  I'll tell you why.  Hair is not 100% a match at all.  There's a lot of factors that go into hair that might not make it.  DNA is as concrete a thing as you can possibly get.  And I say only in a certain case, it's only allowed to be used in certain things.  Usually when it's put as this thing for good, at the beginning it sounds really good,  and then it's only later on you find out, uh-oh, we never saw that coming.  Well, that's the argument we use against the Patriot Act. 
[03:53:00]  But I mean, it might be corrupted.  If it's corrupted, then you jump in and you sue and you stop it.  Well, it was immediately.  Well, okay.  That's what you got to do.  I mean, not the idea of the Patriot Act, but the idea of it being used inappropriately.  Yeah.  I mean, anything that's used inappropriately has to be challenged as it's happening.  Yeah, but if the people that put it in place are in charge, it can only go up so  high before someone knocks it down, and it's usually the people that put it in place.  No, the court will usually step in.  I mean, the court, are you kidding me?  The Patriot Act, I mean, there's always some court that's going to jump in and say this  is wrong or that's wrong. 
[03:53:30]  A lot of things are overturned.  Mom, see what you did.  See what you did.  But no, I'm saying, I'm only talking about, because I think that when I see guys going  to jail for 20 years for rapes they didn't commit, or the fact that there's rapists out  there that we can't catch.  Jimmy, they probably did something.  You probably did.  They probably did something.  You know what?  It's funny.  They're looking, and they're lawyers, so they're looking at us babbling like we're fucking  an ant farm.  No, but I'm saying.  Like they look through the window like we're ants just trying to get a cricket down a hole.  But no, I want to know from a lawyer, though, but what are the benefits? 
[03:54:00]  Like, what could society use it for that would be so bad that it would outweigh, say, catching...  I'm not talking about people's age results and then showing insurance companies so you can't  get insurance.  I mean, what could be worse than...  I don't understand how that could be bad.  You're talking about having a way to classify people by any factor the government chose to  classify them.  And, you know, you say we step in. 
[03:54:30]  If it's being misused, you're assuming that we find out and that someone has the wherewithal  to file a suit and that the suit is successful.  And it just seems to me that the risk is just overwhelming, that it could be used in ways  that are to deny people health insurance.  How, though?  Yeah.  How?  They can just take a blood example.  They can take a blood sample if they want to deny you health insurance.  I mean, like, how could they deny you health insurance? 
[03:55:00]  Like, for what?  Because you have the gene for something that's going to cost a lot as you...  Maybe in the future it'll show up.  Okay.  Well, then that's something that has to be put into the law.  A future disease or something.  Okay.  That they find in the DNA, like, oh, wow, if you're going to have a kid...  You're predisposed to have this.  Absolutely.  Okay.  Then that's something that has to be in there.  Like, you can't do that.  You have a lot more faith in the law than I do.  And it's never changing.  But don't forget, when you go for insurance, there's a lot of questions that you have to fill out  a questionnaire before you get insurance. 
[03:55:30]  Like, if you admit that you still smoke, they won't give you certain insurance.  So, I mean, kind of.  Isn't it the same thing that's happening now?  Yeah, but what if you're predetermined through your genes?  It says, wow, we looked at this guy's sample, and in 20 years, he might develop cancer.  Oh, obviously.  Because of that.  Now, we have the right to deny him because we've looked at this and...  Then that's something that has to be...  That's a good point.  And that's something that you have to look at when you're legislating shit like this and say  that that can't happen.  I'm talking about it being used in criminal pursuits. 
[03:56:00]  I'm talking about, do you feel safer knowing that they might not insure somebody?  Or the fact that a guy is going to go on raping people and breaking into their homes and raping  them when they could easily stop him after one, but he's going to be continued to allow  to do that.  I mean, sex crimes are not some random thing that occasionally happens.  They happen all the time.  And I think that the benefits society gets by stopping a lot of these people and putting  these savages in jail outweighs the detriment of somebody who's three, possibly not getting  insurance because he might have cancer when he's 18.  I think that's a lot easier to fight in court.  There would be plenty of ways to reduce crime if you just start throwing rights out the 
[03:56:30]  window.  Atta boy.  I'm not talking about throwing rights out the window.  There's one right.  It's a right of privacy.  I don't think that that's really an invasion of privacy.  The government having some of your DNA, I don't think is...  I'll give the government some of my DNA, throw the White House and jerk off right on the  stairs.  I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.  There you go.  Take that sample with you.  I don't think that's an invasion of privacy as long as it's not used for a...  Fucking shut up and kiss me.  I'd love to. 
[03:57:00]  Let's agree to disagree.  But no, I...  Why don't we just agree to disagree?  Thank God.  And that's not to take away a right.  Anthony's right, though.  You could actually lose a lot of crime if you cut down on our rights.  But that, to me, the government having my DNA is not infringing on my rights.  Stupid me.  I wanted to know who the mommies find hot out there.  Oh, there you go.  Where do you find hot out there in the celebrity world?  Where do you find hot?  See him on TV. 
[03:57:30]  A little fantasy for mom.  Who's hot out there?  Boy, it says something about my life that I can't think of anybody.  Okay.  Yeah, this one knows.  This one knows.  She's the wild one.  Let's go.  Come on, Amy.  Your fantasy girl's floating around in your head.  Come on, right in front of your sons.  Let's go.  Who do you find hot?  Rumor has it Carmen Electra might be a lesbian.  Hanging out with Joan Jett.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, that's the latest.  Didn't hear that one. 
[03:58:00]  Supposedly they were supposed to go public with their relationship, but so far that's not happened.  Who do you find hot out there?  Close your eyes and say it.  Your sons will tell us.  Hmm.  No?  Maybe that microphone's disgusting them.  A, the shape, and B, the color.  It's black for you at home. 
[03:58:30]  All right.  Well, that was your runner-up line of the day.  Oh, thank you.  Bye.  20 minutes later.  Now, here's a runner-up line of the day, thanks to BodogFight.com.  Is there a black and white relationship here?  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  Wait, wait.  Let me listen to your voice.  Talk a little more.  Let me talk a little more?  Yes.  I'm the white one in the relationship.  I was going to...  We were going to guess that.  That's why we wanted to just talk.  Well, let me see if we could have guessed that.  What time do you start work in the morning?  I start at...  That's all you got to say.  There you go. 
[03:59:00]  Your runner-up line of the day.  They canceled baseball games in Cleveland.  That's live?  They got all that snow overnight?  Wow.  Holy shit.  BodogFight.com.  Go to slash PPV to find out about their Clash of the Nations.  This is your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Do you want to know what people called me for supporting Harold Ford Jr.? 
[03:59:30]  Do you want to know the male I got to call me an in-lover?  And do you want to know what people said to me for the years that I played Bishop Patterson sermons?  People tell me they didn't want to hear that.  What are you going to match?  Tell them people said to me when I booked the Blind Boys of Alabama here years ago,  and they've been on fairly regularly ever since then? 
[04:00:00]  Glad I miscut my letters.  What they said about me.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.  And you know, when I'm just saying that stuff, that should have been said defensively.  Like, how could you think I'm a racist, you idiots?  Like, instead of like, in a sad way.  But it was said like, and I, uh...  Yeah, instead of like, I did this, I did this, half the cancer kids that come to our place are 10% are black, half of them are not. 
[04:00:30]  That should have been like you fucking morons where you look at the facts and stop knee-jerk reacting.  There you go.
