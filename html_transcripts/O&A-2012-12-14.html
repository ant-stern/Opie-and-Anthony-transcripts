<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton engaging in vulgar self-introductions and jokes. They discuss receiving disappointing gifts, including promotional items instead of Christmas presents, and some listener gifts, notably identical mechanical crabs sent by "Coke Logic (J.)" and a broken gift with a humorous note from another listener.  The main focus then shifts to ESPN analyst Rob Parker's controversial "cornball brother" comment about Robert Griffin III. The hosts launch into a lengthy, crude discussion about race, RG3's relationship with his white fiancée, and Parker's perceived bias, speculating on the potential fallout.  This leads to a bizarre tangent about online photo collections of Bruce Springsteen's penis, followed by Opie sharing anecdotes about his agent, "Bob," including a story about Bob's maid stealing money. They conclude this segment with a hypothetical discussion about the consequences of ignoring mail.

The next segment begins with a discussion about one host's husband's perceived energy drain and a funny anecdote about his toddler's fascination with the elderly.  The hosts then transition to comedian Cat Williams' erratic behavior and reported retirement.  They heavily criticize Courtney Love's response to a Nirvana reunion with Paul McCartney,  discussing Frances Bean Cobain's relationship with her mother, and the phenomenon of children legally divorcing their parents, using Gary Coleman and Macaulay Culkin as examples. They compare the aging appearances of Culkin and Steve Buscemi, and Christina Aguilera's changing looks, likening her to Snooki.  Upcoming guests, including Joe DeRosa (in studio), Joe Rogan, and Judd Apatow are mentioned.  A lengthy discussion on Paul Rudd's consistent comedic talent versus Ben Stiller's perceived repetitive character portrayals follows, touching on various Ben Stiller films.  This leads to a discussion of Jack Black and a critical analysis of John Belushi's comedic legacy.  They share their opinions on various comedians and shows, including Cheech & Chong, Monty Python, *Friends*, *SNL* (mentioning specific cast members and sketches), and Norm Macdonald, offering a particularly harsh review of an "Drunk Uncle" sketch from the 12-12-12 concert.  The segment concludes with plans to play Dr. Demento's music and a brief mention of Nicole from the "Morning Mashup" show.

The show then features in-studio guest Joe DeRosa. They reminisce about Cheech & Chong and play "Fish Heads" by Billy Mumy from Dr. Demento's show, discussing its origins and *The Twilight Zone* reboots. A substantial portion is dedicated to a critical analysis of Bobby Moynihan's "Drunk Uncle" character on *Saturday Night Live*, comparing it to similar characters and playing clips.  They play Hayseed Dixie's bluegrass cover of AC/DC's "Highway to Hell". DeRosa promotes his new web series, "We Should Break Up," with Nikki Glazer, and they discuss Cat Williams' arrest and retirement.  DeRosa shares personal experiences of touring, loneliness, and the temptations of the comedian's lifestyle, contrasting his experiences with Bill Burr's.  He shares personal details about his adoption, parents, and recently deceased grandmother, discussing his father's death in a car accident, his father’s experiences in Vietnam, and his reflections on his family's history.

The next segment focuses further on Joe DeRosa's personal life and family history.  He details the recent deaths of several family members, expressing surprise at how much he didn't know about his grandfather's military achievements.  He contrasts his father's affectionate nature with his grandfather's stoicism, sharing anecdotes highlighting their personalities. He discusses his father's experiences in Vietnam and the war's lasting effects.  The conversation expands to his childhood, including his family's financial struggles, his mother's OCD, and his own past behavior.  He links these difficult childhood experiences and family losses to his comedy. Kenny from the show is also present, promoting his stand-up show and web series.  Numerous commercials, including for Pajamagrams, Sherry's Berries, and Steven Singer Jewelers, are interspersed.

The final segment starts with a vague discussion about Joe DeRosa and Nikki, followed by a Pajamagram commercial.  The main focus shifts to an internal conflict and personnel changes at the show. Opie's announcement of a fight with Anthony and the firing of Danny, a long-time staff member, from a previous show, dominates the conversation, alongside listener calls regarding technical issues with the SiriusXM app.  The conversation then turns sexually explicit, focusing on Bruce Springsteen's penis, with various staff members (Troy, Eric) and callers contributing.  The hosts then discuss their experiences at the SiriusXM holiday party, focusing on Roland's account of the substandard food and drink.  Another staff party at an old synagogue is also mentioned. The show concludes with more commercials, further speculation about Danny’s firing, and promotion of upcoming events including a DJ gig.

So, glad you did.  We were just farting.  I did, but I didn't know it stopped.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow. Thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show. 
[00:04:00]  This is not going to get any better.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply.  The Opium Antity Show.  The greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  Oh, and I every day.  That's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Rules are destroyed.  And conventions burn the crowd.  Would you like to make some fucking second? 
[00:04:30]  With Opie the Destroyer.  I would eat Petty White's ass.  He's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony the Rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted.  I'm tired of these people.  Up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you.  And Jim Norton.  Lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opium Antity Show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt. 
[00:05:00]  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, we just opened up shitty gifts.  Which puts us in a bad mood.  Thought we were going to get something really good there.  Because it's around Christmas time.  E-Rock came in with gifts.  Yeah.  When gifts come in, we get all happy.  And one was a box.  A black box and stuff.  What's in the box?  We open it up.  And it's a promotional shit. 
[00:05:30]  For what?  Don't send promotional shit around Christmas time.  Because we're going to think it's a Christmas present.  Exactly.  For Arnold's new movie.  Arnold Schwarzenegger?  Yeah, so we get promotional like a t-shirt.  Fuck, man.  What kind of new movie is he making?  I don't know.  What is his new movie?  It's the one where he's like, I'm tired.  It's called The Last Stand.  I'm old action hero.  You've always wanted to see Arnold Schwarzenegger team up with Johnny Knoxville, right?  No.  Well, this is... 
[00:06:00]  Wait a minute.  You got an actual gift from this guy?  What is this?  He gave everyone something different.  Well, everyone that he decided to send a gift to.  100.  1,001 classic commercials.  Wow.  That's actually cool.  I kind of like that.  Who's that from?  Oh, right.  I should look at who it's from.  Hey.  It is the season of giving, and the listeners are sending gifts in this year.  I wonder why.  It's from Santa.  From Santa.  Oh, Santa.  Yeah.  And what do you get?  That sounds...  That looks good.  1,001 classic commercials. 
[00:06:30]  It's got...  I'm seeing something for Silly Putty.  Yeah.  Ajax.  Yeah.  This cleaning cleanser.  Yeah.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  All kinds of...  Why don't we play it?  ...products.  We should just let it rip us.  Let it just roll.  Well, I got a note in my gift.  Oh.  Oh.  Is it from the same person?  Yes.  Son of a bitch.  What does it say?  What does it say?  It's a good joke, but now I don't have anything.  I just gave away the punchline, but I don't care.  I bought you a gift made of glass and figured I would save you time, so I broke it and threw 
[00:07:00]  it out.  I knew you would like it.  He just ran out of money.  Yeah.  Did he get you anything?  No.  That's it?  He has gifts.  He has gifts for Troy Kwan and paid intern Sal, but Travis already opened Sal's.  Oh.  What was in Sal's?  What did Sal get?  He gave to Sal a trucking magazine, like a digest-sized magazine that says, best driver 
[00:07:30]  jobs.  Oh.  Oh, very good.  So that way maybe Sal could be a truck driver.  Yeah, he could drive a truck or some other vehicle.  Sorry.  It came open.  Oh, God.  That's so demeaning.  Sam's a prick.  He just threw it on the floor in front of Sal, so he had to pick it up himself.  You like it?  That's driver jobs.  This is awesome.  That is good, right?  Yeah.  You should get that.  You got a present.  Sam and I didn't get anything.  You would be a big get in the trucking community.  What?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:08:00]  If a truck stops showering.  As long as you didn't mind a dick or two in your ass.  Right, right.  You'd be a big get.  What the fuck?  I got a note.  That's bullshit.  It was funny and all, but...  Like, the joke's funny, but he should, like, have another thing in there, maybe.  Like, oh, just kidding.  And then there's another, like, little gift, maybe.  You could do Yankee swap with Sal.  I'll just...  No, I don't...  Oh, fuck.  You don't want the...  You don't want to interact with Sal.  What else is there?  I wound up making out great on that one.  There's an envelope for Troy Kwan and an envelope for Jim. 
[00:08:30]  Price is still on it.  Oh.  Let's open up Jim's.  Okay.  Do you want Jim's?  Let's open up Jim's.  There you come.  I got to eat.  Oh, you didn't get your Coke Logic present.  Oh, yeah.  It's still back there.  Oh, yeah.  What's the Coke Logic present?  Oh, wait till you see.  He sent everyone gifts.  Really?  It looked like it was the same thing I got.  Oh.  By the way, where is mine?  I don't know.  Focus up here.  Leave it here?  What?  I got some nice wine yesterday for somebody. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's the kind I drank, too.  So thank you to that person.  You got a note also.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Jim, they say it's the thought that counts.  I was going to get you something, then thought, nah, here's a thought.  Shouldn't sleep apnea be for people with narcolepsy?  Oh, boy.  He's a regular comedian.  Well, at least you got a gift.  I did get a gift.  And so?  For $9.98. 
[00:09:30]  The price is still prominently displayed on the front.  What is this?  It's from Coke Logic.  He wrapped it in tin foil.  Coke Logic wraps it in tin foil, yeah.  Why?  Is that his thing?  It's different.  He's a hipster.  Yeah.  Is he really?  Yeah.  A Chicago hipster?  Yeah.  Hipster.  God, do I hate the hipster.  God, he wants to make sure that everything is intact here.  Oh, duct tape.  Duct tape.  Duct tape and tin foil he wraps with.  That's wonderful.  Merry Christmas, Coke Logic, parentheses, J. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, in case you didn't know which Coke Logic.  Oh, man.  I never knew his real name was J.  Let's see what it is.  Oh, boy.  It's the same thing.  Same thing you got me.  That's what you got to answer.  Yeah.  What is it?  It's something with much too small parts to have in front of a child.  Oh, no kidding.  What is it?  It's a little mechanical crab. 
[00:10:30]  So what happens?  I don't know.  You turn it on and it walks sideways.  It goes.  Really?  That could be kind of cool.  Yeah, you know.  For the young son.  Right.  Should we open up Troy's?  Yeah, we should.  Of course we should.  He hasn't come in to claim it.  We're the only ones.  Troy?  We're the only ones that should get presents in here.  Yeah, no shit.  To tell you the truth.  Three.  Okay.  Thank you, Coke Logic.  Too late.  Too late.  You're already opening it.  Yeah, I'm already opening it.  Sam.  Oh.  Sam's opening your gift.  Troy is in the house. 
[00:11:00]  Eric is producing today.  He really is.  Yeah, Eric.  He played the shitty version of Ecstasy of Gold.  Why did you do that today?  Do something different.  We have other versions that we've never played, so.  Eric works in mysterious ways.  You never know what you're going to get with the sex.  Yeah.  With the sex.  Not a great version.  The bageling.  Yeah.  Sorry, Drew.  He bageled the shit out of that.  Was that Drew's version?  Yeah.  Oh, well.  World Trade 7. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, my God.  A whole conspiracy book on World Trade Center 7 there, right?  Nice book.  Nice.  Thank you.  Troy actually got something he likes.  It looks like somebody likes Anthony and Troy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There it is.  That's painfully honest.  I got 1,001 class of commercials.  There you go.  I got a note, Troy.  You know, I could just pop them up online and listen to 1,000 commercials.  Hey, that's cool, though.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You're bitching.  You want my note?  No, no.  I don't want your note.  I'm good. 
[00:12:00]  I am good.  Well, the gifts keep coming in there.  Christmas is right around the corner.  And what's this from the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie?  Yeah, it's just a promotional t-shirt.  It's like a t-shirt.  What's the name of his movie coming out?  The Last Stand.  See, they got us.  Now we're talking about a shitty Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.  Oh, look.  It's tied in a little bow.  Oh, it's a horrible t-shirt.  These are horrid, right?  I would never wear this.  This is a hard t-shirt.  How do you explain this t-shirt? 
[00:12:30]  Oh, cool.  It's like a softball.  It's a baseball tee.  Oh, it is a baseball tee.  It's pretty cool.  Arnold on the front.  Fucking everyone's shooting it out on the front.  I'd probably wear that.  The back is Arnold Schwarzenegger.  The Last Stand, January 18th.  Oh, Christmas.  It's big.  I'm getting larger.  Travis has mine, officially.  And you know what?  Sam, I'm going to keep mine.  Oh.  No, you're kidding.  You take it.  I don't give a shit.  It's an XL.  It's not going to fit me or Travis.  Oh, my God.  When is the new movie coming out? 
[00:13:00]  January 18th.  Oh, wow.  Did you guys try your gifts from yesterday?  The sound things?  No.  Oh, I took mine home, though.  Yeah.  I tried mine either.  I'm going to like...  Are you going to re-gift it?  I'm going to repurpose that one.  E-Ray, if gay.  Oh, re-purpose.  I'm going to repurpose that one.  That one's going to somebody else.  Yeah.  That's a good way to put re-gifting.  Repurpose that.  I'm just repurposing.  Yes.  I didn't get anything today I can repurpose.  It's a label maker.  It's not bad. 
[00:13:30]  I kind of like the bug thing.  This will freak out my kid.  It will.  It's kind of creepy.  And that's all it does?  Yeah.  It just kind of walks sideways.  And then what happens?  That's a crab.  That's it?  That's about it.  All right.  You could chase it around.  Fair enough.  You could swat it.  Swat it?  I don't know.  Swattable.  The tagline for this movie is...  Oh, no.  Retirement is for sissies.  Oh, God.  Sissies?  I bet they get in trouble for that.  For the word sissies?  We're using the word sissy.  It's the best word.  We're in that world right now. 
[00:14:00]  You can't say sissy.  How the hell are we going to have fun?  I don't know.  If you take all our words away, we can't have fun anymore.  All our fun words, especially, like sissy.  Sissy.  Don't be a sissy, Mary.  Cornball.  Cornball brother.  Cornball brother.  We're not allowed to say anymore.  Cornball brother.  Cornball brother.  I never heard that used, like cornball brother.  Why is that guy in trouble?  He said cornball brother.  Yeah.  You're not allowed to say cornball brother.  Apparently not.  Well, he kind of...  What's the story?  I didn't...  I'm out on this one. 
[00:14:30]  He elaborated on cornball brother is what the problem was, I think.  And it's also...  I mean, he's a sports analyst.  He's not supposed to be like...  Yeah, yeah.  No, that's what they're supposed to be like.  Guys.  Sports analyst?  Guys just being dopey.  That's true.  A lot of sports writers and analysts are, like, tweeting support for him.  Of course.  That, like, you know, this...  If you're kind of doing...  It's live TV.  Like, what are you going to say?  Yeah, if you're doing sports, kind of a guy thing, you should be able to be silly  and start talking about cornball brothers. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  What's his name?  Rob Parker from ESPN?  Rob Parker?  He wasn't being silly.  He was just confusing to people.  I mean, I don't think he should be fired.  He's just kind of an idiot.  This did sound very disjointed.  Yeah, like, he sounded like he was literally, like, studying this.  Like, he was being analytical about it.  Right.  So what?  It was a little roundtable discussion?  Yeah, they were talking about RG3.  Good old RG3.  You know RG3, right?  RG3.  One of the best quarterbacks in the league.  Has a lot of potential.  The new stain remover I saw on an infomer. 
[00:15:30]  Maybe not officially the best quarterback, but he's way up there.  He probably won't win Rookie of the Year, but...  But he has a lot of potential, this guy.  I think if Andrew Luck didn't do such a good job...  Andrew Luck is lucky to be on the field.  They're nine and four.  He might do better if he wasn't a cornball brother.  Or something.  That was my Earl Weaver.  Andrew Luck!  He could go fuck himself.  I guess they were talking about his quote saying that you don't have to be defined by that. 
[00:16:00]  And by that he means being African American.  That's what RG3 said.  Right.  That makes perfect sense.  You don't have to be defined by...  Yeah, why let that define you?  He's a quarterback.  He's, you know...  He's a very well-spoken person.  It fucking sounds great.  Right.  And then this guy called him a cornball brother.  That's because he's a cornball brother.  A cornball brother.  You got it over there or I got it over here?  What's up?  You can play it over there.  I boosted it a little.  My question, which is just a straight honest question.  Is he a brother or is he a cornball brother? 
[00:16:30]  What does that mean?  Yeah, explain that.  Well, he's not...  See...  They're like, yeah, explain that.  They're all like sitting back like, oh boy, let's look at this...  Here we go.  Let's look at this victim.  They're just watching them.  Explain that.  Go down the shitter.  Let's watch them go down the shitter right here.  It's sports.  Let them fucking fool around a little bit.  How come...  It doesn't have to be so serious.  You know what?  You're absolutely right.  But we all know the environment.  Right.  Why doesn't anybody at this point, right here, where it's all safe, go, look, shut up. 
[00:17:00]  Just stop right now.  Everyone watches somebody flush their career away and just sits there.  Just go, dude, uh-uh.  Don't say what you're going to say.  Elaborate.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  What do you mean, cornball brother?  What does that mean?  Well, he's not really, okay?  He's black.  He kind of does the thing, but he's not really down with the cause.  He's not one of us.  He's kind of black.  He's in the bus.  But he's not really like the guy you really want to hang out with because he's off to 
[00:17:30]  something else.  Oh, God.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Oh, no, you didn't just say that.  They're all sitting there like, oh, no.  Just sounds like an idiot.  He does, yeah.  How far into the explanation do you think when he was going, oh, I shouldn't be talking about  this anymore?  Yeah, you think it hit him at some point?  Like, and, you know, someone you wouldn't want to hang out.  What am I saying?  Oh, no.  But what's the cause?  Down with the cause.  What's down with the cause mean?  You know.  The cause.  The community. 
[00:18:00]  The struggle.  Black's taking over?  What's up?  No, like, that's the extreme of the cause.  Well, I don't know.  What's the cause?  What is it talking about?  The plight of the black man.  RG3 just wants to play some good football.  This guy.  What is this guy doing?  Exactly.  This guy has.  He should just be fired for being an idiot.  Right.  Yeah.  Not because he's offending anyone.  The moron.  He shouldn't be fired at all, obviously, but.  He's absolutely taking this a little far.  When he says, like, yeah, down with the, what do you, what do you, the cause? 
[00:18:30]  Because he's, he's trying to figure out how to not say, well, he's black, but not really  black.  Yeah.  So he's trying to figure out, like, what, what can he do with some intellect to add  to that?  But he's saying stuff like he's not down with the cause.  The cause is this whole environment, though, that, like, like, if this guy is assimilating  to society and, and enjoying his, his life and his job and not just making excuses and 
[00:19:00]  that's the cause.  That seems to be the cause.  And this other guy, this quarterback, he's fucking fine.  He's like, this is great.  Yeah, I think there's, like, an underlying thing, if the shit goes down, right, which  side are you going to be on?  Right.  The cause.  The cause.  The cause.  Oh.  I want to hang out with, because he's walked through something else.  Why is that your question?  Well, because that's just how I, I want to find out about him.  I don't, I don't know, because I keep hearing these things.  We all know he has a white fiance.  Oh.  Oh my God.  Why, what an idiot. 
[00:19:30]  This guy is crazy racist, by the way.  This guy.  You can just tell.  I think he has a crush on RG3.  He's bummed out.  I'm just going to stick with my iPhone.  What?  Instead of the RG3?  I'm not going with the RG3.  Why?  The RG3 is terrific.  Is it?  Oh, yeah.  For cornballs.  For cornballs.  For cornballs.  Cornball brother.  Yeah.  Right about now.  Cornball.  The cornball brother.  Check it out now.  The cornball brother.  Right about now.  We've got to make that before Todd does. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, man.  Todd.  That's dope.  She's still around.  Talking about Scott and Todd, right?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I saw him on that fucking Dish Nation.  Of course he's around.  I'll show my mom in dress.  Brilliant.  Oh, really?  We didn't talk about this yet on the show?  I think you mentioned it.  Oh.  Quickly.  Does she think that's like what you do?  Well, now she's annoyed because I told her the show stinks.  So then she's like, well, why does it stink? 
[00:20:30]  So I go, well, that's like my business, but it's all like the hacky side.  Yeah.  Oh, she thinks it's terrific.  Maybe that's how I get her to love me.  Oh.  Let's get some cameras in here.  We'll do some Dish Nation.  Get on Dish Nation.  No, the problem isn't that she doesn't love me.  Oh, my God.  Dish Nation stinks.  She's not dishy enough.  Yeah.  Oh, it's terrible.  Does she want to know why you can't be more like that Todd Pettengale boy?  Oh, he is a dream. 
[00:21:00]  Now he's funny.  Right.  You know, STDs are way up in those assisted living homes.  I've heard that.  What?  They're fucking, huh?  Yeah, they are.  Old people are fucking?  Yeah, they are.  Jesus Christ.  That's crazy.  I don't think my mom is.  What's going on?  Her uterus is a little droopy.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  It's a little droopy.  Didn't you say there was a man that she thought was handsome in there?  That was last year.  That guy must have died.  I don't know.  Well, that's one plus. 
[00:21:30]  That was the one where she said he has a good body and good teeth.  It is amazing what they look at at that age.  It's like if you get into a relationship that you're no longer interested in, you're just  like, I can't wait until he dies.  Yeah, yeah.  And then you just wait for him to die.  Yeah, because it's coming up.  He's going to.  It's like high school, but instead of moving on to somebody else or moving out of the neighborhood  or something, you die.  Right.  The relationships are the same, though.  Some of these assisted living places, man, they're rocking it.  We went to a Christmas party.  We actually had fun. 
[00:22:00]  Really?  Yeah, they had live music.  The food was amazing.  Live music, dead audience.  Yes.  What kind of live music was it?  Was it like.  It wasn't bad.  It was just, you know.  It wasn't like.  It was just a.  1940s music?  No, no.  It was your typical shit.  They were playing Christmas music, so, you know, but it's a band you'd probably see anywhere  else.  Sleeves?  Sleeves.  Sleeves was there.  Okay.  But then they got movie night, a game room.  They got a fucking library. 
[00:22:30]  It's like being in a dorm situation with old people.  Does your mom like it there?  Dorm with death.  Oh, lots of death.  Lots of death.  And fucking dementia.  A lot of dementia.  Dementia dorm.  But that's like a college dorm.  What are you talking about?  Right, of course.  Instead of drunk.  So you didn't go to college.  There was a lot of dementia in the college dorm.  Trust me.  That is true.  It was probably very similar.  Yeah.  Drunk or stoned or something.  You just have dementia. 
[00:23:00]  Right.  You still wander in the hallways not knowing what the fuck you're doing.  Oh, I would give those people pot.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  If they need some weed.  If I get to that stage, why not?  You live your life.  Just stoned.  You sit around in your room waiting for your loved ones to show up, but they never do now, do  they?  Oh, boy.  So why not give them some pot to pass the time?  They could use it.  Some pot.  Why not?  Why not?  All right.  Let's get back to the cornball brother.  All right.  Cornball brother.  We all know he has a white fiance.  Let's talk about he's a Republican, which there's no, there's no information at all. 
[00:23:30]  I'm just trying to dig deeper into why he has an issue, because we did find out with  Tiger Woods.  Tiger Woods was like, I don't want to.  I got black skin, but don't call me black.  So people got a little.  Yeah, because he's also Asian.  Yes.  Yes.  What a fucking idiot.  He's also Asian.  Yeah.  RG3 is way more black than Tiger Woods.  Of course.  Tiger Woods is half Asian.  Yes.  So maybe he's decided, that's the side of him he wants to explore. 
[00:24:00]  By the way.  It's not up to the public.  Did you notice on that portion of the clip, that's where he realized, uh-oh, I think I'm  in trouble?  Right.  Yeah.  Because he starts kind of stuttering, like, where am I going with this?  Why the fuck am I even talking about this?  He did a Troi Kwan.  He's like, I'm just asking questions.  Just asking questions.  My argument's unfounded.  What do we know about RG3?  Did he grow up kind of in a white environment?  Well, he's a Republican, but they're not really saying much about that.  Isn't that the morning after pill? 
[00:24:30]  I think it is, though.  I think it is.  Call me black.  So people got a little wondered about Tiger Woods early on about him.  What do RG3's braids say to you?  Now, that's different, because to me, that's very urban and makes you feel like, I think  he would have a clean cut if he was more straight-laced or not.  Like, wearing braids is, you're a brother.  You're a brother.  You're not braids.  He baited him there. 
[00:25:00]  Stephen, what's your take on this?  Well, first of all, let me say this.  I'm uncomfortable with where we just went.  That guy, finally the voice of fucking reason.  And that's Stephen A. Smith, probably.  Right.  He usually takes it to the edge.  He puts his foot in his mouth almost every day.  And he's uncomfortable with where they just went.  This just sounds like a shitty show.  Wow.  Man, I don't even have an opinion.  You gotta have an opinion.  All the people in the room with him were asking that dude questions like he was Bobo or somebody. 
[00:25:30]  Like, they're just, you know, asking you, oh, you're gonna sound stupid after I ask you this one.  What about his braids?  What about his full lips?  Talk about that a little.  If you listen to the end of that clip, what's his name?  The reporter, who's putting his foot in his mouth, is doing everything in his power to not say,  well, his braids make him seem like he's really black. 
[00:26:00]  If he wasn't that black, like he's trying to fight saying not that black and really black.  Just tell me.  By use of the word brother and cornball brother.  Are they, uh, is he in trouble?  Yeah.  I say fired, so fucking fired.  That's my verdict.  For just that?  Yes.  ESPN's already come out with something saying they're, uh, going over.  Oh, no.  They're seeing.  I get it.  See, there's an internal investigation to see what's fired, so fired.  He's an idiot, but, I mean, they might as well shut down all shows that do a, you know, 
[00:26:30]  a round table discussion.  Right.  Because you're gonna just put your foot in your mouth.  Eventually.  Yeah.  Maybe it was a slow day.  Disney Hammer's gonna come down on him.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's Disney.  Oh, he's so done.  Maybe, uh, you know, maybe it was a slow day for these guys.  He's just starts yapping about something.  But you can't have a bunch of sports guys yapping without them gonna, they're gonna go into  some areas.  Yes.  ESPN statement.  Uh-oh.  The comments were inappropriate and we are evaluating our next steps. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, he's so done.  Oh, evaluating our next steps.  Oh, forget it.  Next steps is something Gary says.  Oh.  Well, once again, we have to say it every time.  We've been through this.  Yes.  All that means is if anyone else was in on this.  Right.  Yeah.  Did you talk to anyone else before the show and they encourage you to say, Cornball Brother.  Even asking about the braids.  That guy's nervous.  Going, uh-oh, did I contribute to this?  Right, right.  I should have shut up.  Oh, look at this.  That guy.  He's so fired. 
[00:27:30]  He looks like a Cornball.  He looks stupid.  He does look like a Cornball Brother.  He really looks like a Cornball.  He's a stupid guy.  Rob Parker, stupid guy.  Yeah.  He's a TV veteran working as an expert debater on ESPN First Take.  An expert debater.  Oh, boy.  I didn't hear any expert debating right there.  No expertise there, sir.  He better be an expert debater in the back office when they call him in.  He has a master's in journalism from Columbia. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, wow.  That makes sense.  That's a big deal.  Yeah.  He didn't learn much.  Jesus, he is so fired.  He started his PhD at NYU, but didn't finish it.  No.  I guess he thought that was like a Cornball move.  He was too corny for him.  I don't know.  What's Cornball?  That's so fucked up.  Like, I didn't know that was a word that went along with somebody not being black enough  for the black community.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, he used Cornball.  Being a Cornball.  You're a Cornball.  Patrice used to use Cornball. 
[00:28:30]  Did he?  I never knew what the context was.  Ah, you're a Cornball.  I've heard Cornball, but I've never heard it used in the fact that you're not black enough  for the community.  That's weird.  And then he brings up his white fiance.  How white is his fiance?  How does she look?  Got a pick?  That's just stupid, because if you fall in love, you fall in love.  Right.  I mean, why?  So, the guy falls in love with a white broad, but because he's black, he should blow off  that love to get a, what?  A black woman?  A set of tits on her. 
[00:29:00]  Ew.  Ew.  Yeah, well.  She's not.  She's a curvy white chick, so it's like it's okay.  She is curvaceous.  RG3 should be doing better than that.  It's not that Cornball.  But love is blind.  She should be holding a Star Wars blaster.  What do you mean?  She's got those milk tits.  Does she have milk tits?  They are full.  They're full, and you know she's very white.  They have to be like high school.  She's got big, white milk tits.  There she is, placing more flowers at her father's grave. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, boy.  Whoa.  Yeah, that's an ample set.  Dude, those are so ample.  Those things aren't moving, and they're big.  Ah, she's all right, I guess.  You know.  Yeah, she could be a nice enough girl.  What are you going to?  Whoa.  She's close to a tree, though, in this photo.  And we know what the trees are used for.  Yes.  Cover up some hurt.  She's leaning on the back end of the tree.  Yes.  Cutting off some of the left side of her body.  That just makes you look slimmer. 
[00:30:00]  Whoa, look at that again right there.  She looks much better.  Man.  She either looks really awful or really good.  Yeah, that picture looks really good.  That's her?  She's like Two-Face.  Wait, what the fuck?  Now we're looking at this.  She's beautiful.  She looks great there.  What was wrong with the other pictures?  She's got a little more makeup on this.  Yeah, yeah.  And I think the way...  She toned down a little bit?  The way that...  No, I think it's the way that other guys' shoulders coming into the shot, it cuts off how thick she is. 
[00:30:30]  A little bit, right?  Oh.  A little bit.  A little bit.  She is a thick girl.  Wait, what's the...  You missed a bikini shot.  What?  Of course you did.  Oh, is that Kim Kardashian?  Oh.  Well, why is she in the Google images for RG3?  Elias, yeah.  Wow.  Okay.  Oh, they are in love.  Look at this.  That's right.  Taboo love.  Oh.  Naughty, naughty.  Well. 
[00:31:00]  Well, what have we got here?  Let's hide our little secret.  What's happened?  Don't tell mommy and daddy.  Oh, no.  Google her.  Give us a fuck he's in love with a white girl.  That guy, apparently.  But that's just stupid.  Yeah.  I mean, if you break it down, the guy falls in love with her.  She's white.  But this guy's like, well, fuck the love angle.  You should be falling in love with a black girl.  Exactly.  That's what he's saying, pretty much.  First of all, it's not easy to fall in love.  No.  Most of the people listening to our voices, they just settle. 
[00:31:30]  They're not even in love with the person they're with.  Oh, settled.  Sorry.  It's terrible.  It is true.  I know.  It's an awful thing.  The exception to the rule.  We have a great...  You know what?  For how sucky this studio is, the placement is great.  We have a fucking runway that we can look at anyone that walks down it for quite an extended  time and get a really good angle on people as they walk down the hallway. 
[00:32:00]  How many feet would you say that is?  From all the way down to our office?  It's like a runway.  To our office, then they start getting a little too small to keep following.  200 feet, maybe?  Yeah.  It is pretty long.  Oh, what have we got here?  Well, what have we got here?  Oh, taboo.  It also gives you...  She's wearing those boots that all the ladies are wearing.  Yeah.  The ones that come up to their knees.  And they tuck their jeans inside.  Oh, ho, ho.  Oh, wow.  You can always tell which girls, you know, got it last night. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, a little...  By the way they walk.  We really get a great angle on...  Because we can get into the whole walk thing and view from behind to see what they're up to.  So, RG3, both his parents were in the military and he got his degree from Baylor.  Oh, yeah?  Isn't Baylor kind of a black college?  I don't know.  I don't know either.  I know there are black colleges.  I just knew that one, the colleges that the Huxtables went to. 
[00:33:00]  Which one was that now?  He went to...  He went to Harvard, right?  What?  The Huxtables?  Right.  Hillman.  No, Hillman.  Hillman.  Oh, Hillman.  Hillman.  Because there was a big debate as to which college the daughter was going to go to.  Was she going to go to Hillman?  Right.  Or was she going to go to the other one?  The other...  What was it?  Damn it.  That was just like my house.  Oh, exactly.  It was either you're going to Geneseo or you're going to continue your caddying career. 
[00:33:30]  Is that her?  I related to the Huxtables growing up.  Yeah, I had the same decision to make.  Yeah.  My house is just like the Huxtables.  Right.  The Huxtables.  Hey, can we look at Bruce Springsteen's cock, please?  Oh, man.  Sure.  You heard that this thing has taken off, right?  His cock?  Yeah, there's Tumblr accounts and...  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  It's become...  People love...  Oh, my God.  People love dedicating sites and... 
[00:34:00]  Wow, that's a bunch of pictures of Bruce's cock.  Is this the main Tumblr account on it?  Yeah, this is BruceSpringsteen's crotch.tumblr.com.  Now, see that...  His helmet is like pointing down in that one.  Is that or is it a ball sack?  But then there's more pictures where it looks like he's got a full rod and it's poking all  the way up to the right.  There's a young Bruce.  Uh-huh.  Oh, well, I don't see anything really there.  It looks like his dick might have gotten bigger. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  With age.  I think it's plumped up with age.  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  A lot of pictures.  Yeah.  Maybe he just started getting erect when he went on stage at an older age.  I'm going to speculate that he's using some type of sexual enhancement medicine when he  plays live because it probably increases blood flow and gives him that energy.  That's how he does those four-hour shows.  Right.  But the side effect, giant rod.  Giant rods in front of two billion people. 
[00:35:00]  Right.  Not the worst thing to happen to you.  No, I mean, really.  Look at that.  With the headband Bruce.  Remember headband Bruce?  Headband Bruce, sure.  Bruce.  With the t-shirts and the jeans.  Yep.  Now he wears the vest.  He wears a gentleman's vest now on stage.  Fucking Mr. Born in the USA right there.  All right.  So let's make sure we keep on top of the Bruce Springsteen cock thing.  Wow.  Bruce looking like a fucking beatnik there with the beard.  Remember him with the scraggly beard mustache? 
[00:35:30]  Sure.  Look.  Forgot about that, Bruce.  You think of Bruce now, you just think of Bruce.  This age, Bruce.  That's the Bruce from 1975.  Right.  But you don't think of that, Bruce.  That's the Born to Run, Bruce.  That's weird.  With the shitty beard.  Right.  But he didn't care.  Because he's just a guy from Jersey making good.  What a long career Bruce has had.  Chris Christie had answered the fat question with Barbara Walters.  Oh, really?  Mm-hmm.  Did he weep? 
[00:36:00]  Did he get weepy?  I can be honest.  I'm tired.  I went out with Bobby even last night.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, boy.  Party?  Well, I started sleeping when we hit the restaurant.  Yeah.  That'll do it.  I had breakfast with him.  Yeah.  Wow.  Our agent is the biggest fucking bore.  But he doesn't think he is, which is really fascinating.  Yeah.  And then he has a brother that's like his twin.  Yep.  And I just sat there.  I know. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, my God.  And I tried to get conversation going.  I was actually going to start recording him.  Were you?  Yeah.  That would have just been a bore fest.  You could have used it to just prop up next to you when you try to go to sleep.  He could be the dullest guy ever.  He really is.  Like, I don't even have a story.  I just need to...  I'm exhausted.  Yeah.  I think I'm exhausted because I was trying so hard to, like, socialize last night.  It's so easy to...  So then it was just me talking for a half hour straight, which I don't like doing, especially 
[00:37:00]  when I'm not on the radio.  But I was trying to get something going.  It's easy to just fall into this not talking and just eating when he's at the table.  If you're not, like, moving the conversation along, it's terrible.  He's a good guy.  Yes.  Of course.  And as I sit here, I'm trying to remember what we talked about.  Yeah.  Good luck.  I don't know.  It could work.  We were there two hours. 
[00:37:30]  Movies?  No.  Sports?  Movies?  No.  I'm sure it was all about this place.  Politics?  No.  12-12.  That was a big deal?  I'm so sick of talking about this place and radio.  Yeah.  So I was like, okay, let's just talk.  Was it about family?  A little bit, I think.  All right.  That's two minutes.  There you go.  There's a cozy two minutes.  He did...  Go ahead, Cher.  It's okay. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, God.  Yeah.  I'm trying to be better.  No, don't even worry about it.  There's no sense I'm changing.  Footage show.  Footage show.  Footage show.  Why do you imitate me?  Just have beyond.  I got another voice from him.  Of course you did.  Let me just say this.  Forget everything I just said.  All right.  Recently, I was out to dinner with this person.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Any idea?  Any hints at who it was?  No.  Or you just want to leave that? 
[00:38:30]  Okay.  No, I want to keep it very vague.  Oh, man.  Keep it very vague.  Will you tell me?  Because I'm not sure if this person wants me to tell the story.  Tell me during the break, will you?  Sure.  All right.  And he discovered that his long time maid slash like nanny was stealing from him.  Holy shit.  Wow.  He was suspicious.  So he set up the old camera. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, man.  And watched this woman that he really trusted with his kids.  Oh, man.  Off and on for 14 years.  Pilfering from him?  He was just taking his...  There's a reason why I'm bringing this up, because this really frustrated me.  So what did she take?  She would take just his...  She would go into his pants pocket every day and see what kind of money he had laying around.  Oh, man.  And he taped her for a week when he got suspicious. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  And, you know, he knew exactly how much money, so he would put the pants out where he usually  does, but there would be money in it.  And in one week, she got him for $145.  So then he's like, well, if she did it for one week and got $145.  Oh, my God, yeah.  He figures that she, over the years, might have took him for 100 Gs.  And my point was, how the fuck do you not notice that your pocket money is low every day?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:40:00]  We all go through that bullshit where, you know, you go to the ATM, let's say you take  out $200 or whatever, and a day later, you're down to $40, let's say.  And you have that freak out, like, where did I just spend $160?  And you try to do that thing in your head, like, oh, the restaurant, oh, that's right,  this and that.  Yeah, yeah.  How does he never do that?  And his money is always just...  Especially, well, is this person usually very thrifty with money?  Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.  That's why it's amazing to me. 
[00:40:30]  Right, right.  But how do you not notice?  Wouldn't you notice if someone in your house was taking $20 to $10 to $20 to $25 a day  from your pockets?  I might not.  Come on.  I might not.  I don't know.  Sometimes I take the pants off, I throw them on the floor, I forget to take the money out  of the pocket, it ends up in the laundry.  Right.  There have been literally hundreds of dollars in my dryer just tumbling around.  Oh, really?  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, but it's safe to say you probably walk around with more money than he does.  Probably do.  He's more on the regular range.  Ange is good, too.  She's not going to steal it.  He might have $100 to $200 on him at all times.  That's about it for him, probably.  Then I would absolutely notice.  Thank you!  All right.  I would notice that.  That's what I'm saying.  It's not like he has $1,000 in his pocket all the time.  I mean, she's taking a little off the top.  Uh-huh.  That's a big chunk if you only have $200 on him.  Right.  Yeah.  And probably less.  I agree with that.  But, I mean, I guess, like, his kid was missing $150. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, no!  His little kid at the time, like, when he was seven.  Aw.  Fast forward seven years, Bob is now suspicious and finally sets up cameras.  I mean, not Bob.  Fuck.  Oh, uh, whoever the guy is.  Whoever the guy is.  Oh, wait, no.  It's just a general name.  No, no, there's a dog over here.  I mean, not Bob.  Fuck. 
[00:42:00]  Sorry about that.  Sorry about that.  Sorry about that.  I've met her over the years.  She was terrific.  Really?  Yeah, she really cared about the kids and all that.  Oh, I bet.  She wanted to keep that fucking job.  Well, what happens is, supposedly, she was doing that to send the money back to her, I'll  keep it fake here, her home country.  Oh.  Oh, so she was a little desperate and realized that Bob just loved pocket fucking money.  Oh, loves a little pocket money.  And then she got, and then she was aware enough that she saw the camera and put a hat over 
[00:42:30]  the camera and then Bob, this person says.  What?  This person says, you could still hear my belt jingling as she's picking up my face.  Fucking Bob's a great, Bob's a great mark.  Oh, really?  What does it take?  He said Bob again.  Mystery guy.  Oh, that mystery guy.  Mystery guy.  Well, you know what it is?  We're not going to use his real name.  We're just going to call him Bob.  Yeah, let's just call him Bob.  Yeah.  Just so he can have a character for the story. 
[00:43:00]  Well, he told me that story.  And then he had to tell his little kids that, you know, the lady that's been sort of half  raising them has to go and they're all like pulling.  God, they must be.  Because they, you know.  They get attached to her.  They're attached to her.  But she's fleecy Bob, $20 at a time.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  Too funny, man.  And then he's like, I don't even know how much she got from my wife because she would  just leave her purse out on the kitchen counter. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, she was probably rifling through that.  Rifling.  It is sad, but, you know.  If you're going to steal, you got to take just a little bit off the top, right?  She bit off a little more than she could chew, I gather.  He told that story.  And then he just said that he walked through Tom Hanks' house.  Really?  Yeah, Tom Hanks doesn't know it, but he did.  Oh, no.  How did Tom Hanks not know?  I think he told me not to tell this one before.  Oh, shit.  I guess, Tom.  Who are we calling this guy? 
[00:44:00]  This is how well we have done with our careers.  Bob, our agent.  Yeah.  Lives in the same neighborhood as Tom Hanks.  Literally, I know where Tom Hanks lives because of my agent.  He moved to this brand new house that he was building.  And Hanks lived across the street, two houses down.  Righteous neighborhood.  And he's not in that house anymore.  That's why they all decided, oh, let's see how Tom Hanks used to live. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, okay.  He moved recently, though.  So he moved.  So they had an open house because they were selling the thing.  What did the digs look like?  He said not.  Oh, really?  A little lackluster?  Yeah.  Considering it's Tom Hanks.  Tom Hanks should have fucking.  You would think he would be doing better.  The Fars Gump money.  Apollo 13 money.  Supposedly he was living in a $5 million.  Yeah.  Supposedly.  He should be in like a fucking.  He moved to a $26 million. 
[00:45:00]  So he finally decided to spend some of his money.  But a $5 million out in L.A. for a big.  And couldn't get you shit.  Big, huge movie star?  Not in the big, nice neighborhood that they live in.  Then all of a sudden he said Kate Hudson lives in his neighborhood.  I know.  Did he rat her out for having a shitty house, too?  Information.  Well, she lives in the house she grew up in.  Really?  I don't know why I know all this stuff.  She's cornball.  And then she bought the house next door so she could have privacy.  The house next door?  Really?  Yeah. 
[00:45:30]  They buy the houses next door just for privacy reasons.  That's interesting.  That's how rich people are.  You're like, fuck, I have a nice house, but my neighbors could kind of see.  Right, right.  It's my backyard, so I'm going to buy their house now.  Mm-hmm.  And that's what they do.  And then it's sort of like a little guest mansion.  Oh.  If you have guests coming over.  Sounds nice.  Yeah.  That was Bob.  Or, you know, whoever.  Whoever.  Well, the other story was Bob.  Oh, oh.  The first story was, yeah, just a guy. 
[00:46:00]  We'll just call him that, right?  No problem.  What else did he talk about?  He's such Dollsville.  These are the highlight stories.  These are the big stories.  Oh, yeah.  He wants to put his kid in Chinese class.  He wants his kid to learn Chinese.  Learn Chinese because he sees that as the big wave of the future.  I would imagine that if you put your 10-year-old kid in a Chinese class, his head would literally 
[00:46:30]  explode.  That's got to be all.  That language looks like it's impossible to learn.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just squiggly lines.  I don't know how you read rooftops.  A lot of rooftops.  Like, how do you do that?  It's just squiggly lines.  Don't they have like a thousand characters or something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which would be our letters.  Don't they have like a thousand of those things?  Yeah.  They mean things.  Don't they?  Don't their letters, their individual symbols mean like things?  Like, you wouldn't spell house H-O-S-E. 
[00:47:00]  No, it would be.  You'd spell.  I don't.  I just wrote house H-O-S-E.  I was being funny.  And by the way, Travis, your wife told me you can't spell worth a shit.  What?  She spells things in front of Riley, and she spells like really fast.  Oh.  And she goes, yeah, Travis doesn't really, can't really spell that fast.  He's like, what?  You mean comprehend.  I'm a very excellent speller.  I laughed.  I was laughing at you.  I heard you guys had quite the day.  It was hilarious. 
[00:47:30]  That's great.  It was make fun of Travis.  Yeah, that's good.  Glad she comes over.  But no 10-year-old wants to learn Chinese.  No.  This kid does.  No.  He does.  I guess.  I don't know.  Not being forced into it.  That's crazy, man.  I had a tough time with French.  I can't imagine trying Chinese.  It's hard to learn Spanish, and that's so close to English.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I did six years of Spanish.  I can't speak it.  No.  I can understand Spanish because a lot of Spanish people are in this country, 
[00:48:00]  and if you want to get into a certain, I guess, field, something, I don't know.  French, I see as useless.  Yeah, but Spanish, they're not going to make you any money.  Mm-hmm.  So you know what they're talking about.  Who cares?  Yeah.  Chinese, you know that they're taking over the world.  Well, Chinese, you're going to be able to.  The Chinese are coming in all that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're going to definitely be able to.  So you might be able to thwart off an attack.  The Chinese invasion.  Yeah, I don't know.  You'll be able to pick it up on the radio and hear it and go,  Hey, the Chinese are invading. 
[00:48:30]  I could tell I understood what they said.  Kevin from Connecticut, Chinese, looks like comic swear words to me.  Yeah, in the little talk bubble over the comic's head.  Right.  That's it for my dinner.  I don't know.  I wish I had more to tell you.  Yeah.  I can't even tell you what happened during breakfast at all.  There was nothing.  It was just, I finished my eggs.  He paid the check, and I fucking bolted.  Nice guy, but I don't know what makes him tick, man. 
[00:49:00]  I don't know either.  And then, like, whatever.  Yeah.  He found out I only checked my mail once a week, and that really bothered him.  Really?  Because he sent a check, I guess, because I've got to pay my mortgage.  I don't know.  Like, that's part of my brain.  We just get the mail every once in a while, because it's never fun.  No.  So I let it pile up, and then, like, once a week.  Actually, we go longer than a week.  So, like, let's go get your mail right now.  I'm like, yeah, that's what I want to do.  That sounds exciting, Bob. 
[00:49:30]  Let's do that.  You should go down to the post office and say you don't want any more mail delivered.  Right.  How long would it take for your whole world to blow up if you stopped checking your mail?  Oh, if you stopped checking it at all?  Well, he's still just...  Could you last three months before it gets ugly?  Because that would be three months of bills, because I don't do a lot of online banking.  I do a little, but I'm still, like, old school.  I like signing my own checks and shit like that.  I get piles of bills, but I don't even...  But if you stopped right now, going, you know what? 
[00:50:00]  I'm never checking the mail again.  When would they finally come knock on your door and take your shit away?  And be like, you haven't fucking paid for this.  Right.  How long do you think you can last?  That would be a great social experiment.  I think.  And then document it.  Well, people do it all the time.  But document it as it's slowly happening.  Like, all of a sudden, your lights go off one day because you haven't checked your mail in three months.  I'd say six months.  Six months, and then your lights are out, your cable's gone.  Yeah.  Your internet's gone. 
[00:50:30]  Because they give you so many chances.  Yeah.  You would still have your house, though, because...  I don't even know what I...  I mean, maybe, like, if your car had a recall notice, but, like, all that electric and cable  and the parking lot and everything is all online.  Yeah, but he's talking about if you don't do it online.  I know, yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  If you don't do online banking...  No, that's what I'm saying.  I'd say four months.  I'm sort of old school.  Four months.  Yeah, I still fucking write out my cable bill and all that crap.  I'm old school a little bit. 
[00:51:00]  I'm going to switch over.  It's so time consuming.  But that would be a great documentary.  Yeah.  I've decided to not check my mail anymore and see what happens.  See what happens.  And then one day, you're sitting there and your lights aren't on.  And your lights aren't on.  You're like, click, click, you flip the switch and nothing happens.  Cable, all of a sudden, they're like, fuck you, no cable.  What would you do about phone calls?  They're going to start calling you.  Well, eventually they'll shut off the phone.  That's true.  Yeah.  Cell phone companies are very fast to shut off the phone now.  They're assholes. 
[00:51:30]  Like, I didn't pay...  I forgot to pay my bill once, and like two days afterwards, two days after it was due,  they shut the phone off.  Right.  They're complete assholes.  Two days, yeah.  They're getting so much money from us now, too.  Yeah, and then it's like a $35 reactivation fee.  Yeah, yeah, because it's really tough to just put my phone back online.  Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.  That's why I like the online thing, because I'm terrible.  I am terrible with my shit that I have to pay.  Like, with a check. 
[00:52:00]  I'm awful with it.  I kind of just let things go.  Just do like auto payers and stuff.  And the fucked up thing is, like, my health insurance is one thing that isn't online.  Like, for some reason, I can't fucking pay that online.  I don't know why.  Mm-hmm.  And sometimes I get, like, a notice going, hey, hey, asshole.  And all my insurance, actually, like, homeowners, car, everything's linked together.  And I get a notice going, hey, we're just going to cancel your insurance policy.  I'm like, oh.  And then you look at the date, and it's like a month from now. 
[00:52:30]  Like, oh, okay, I'm okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  They give you that grace period.  Forget about it for a month.  Grace period.  Period.  Yeah.  All right, what else is going on, man?  What's going on in this wonderful world?  Fuck, Bob, Jesus.  He took the energy right out of me.  Like a good fucking vampire.  He can do that.  He's like a vampire.  Exactly.  Is he living off my fucking...  What?  How do vampires do it again?  Your energy. 
[00:53:00]  My energy, not my blood.  Yeah.  He took a bit of my essence last night.  Fuck!  Then he came home and played with my kids.  That was all right.  Aw.  How was that?  My two-and-a-half-year-old is fascinated by old people.  See?  Just fascinated, yeah.  He studies them.  What, does he just look in their face?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They're like, what is going on with that? 
[00:53:30]  But he doesn't know, so then we had to kind of like throw some more words in there and stuff to mix up his little brains. 
[00:54:00]  So he didn't say, you know, hi, weird grandma.  You got to dilute the weird grandma with other words.  Oh, yeah.  Hope it doesn't bubble to the surface.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We were throwing a movie on and then just talking about other stuff and just like...  I just started repeating it just because I said it once.  Should have just let it happen. 
[00:54:30]  That would have been funny.  That would have been.  All right.  Should we eat and shit?  Let's eat our shit.  We got Cat Williams.  He's losing his fucking mind.  Yeah.  Yeah, what's up with that?  We're going to find out next, but I don't know.  He might have quit comedy.  He did.  He retired.  Yeah.  And he went on a tear through Seattle.  Yeah.  He's just been doing crazy shit everywhere he goes.  Crazy.  He tore it up.  He's lost his mind.  Nice.  All right.  We'll do that.  Yeah. 
[00:55:00]  And...  Oh, shut up, Courtney Love.  I just read that, Travis.  Is she really...  She's not happy.  It wasn't a reunion.  Oh, my God.  She doesn't like the fact that Chris and Dave would say reunion.  Did they say it?  Did they even say it?  I think Paul McCartney did.  Everyone else was hyping it.  And I wish he didn't say that because Paul McCartney knows better.  That wasn't a fucking Nirvana reunion.  He should have said that.  That was stupid.  It was him playing with the former members of Nirvana.  That's all that was. 
[00:55:30]  Paul McCartney should have known fucking better.  Nice.  She says that...  She's furious, by the way.  Yeah, furious is the word.  Okay.  All right.  That, you know, Kurt was the heart and soul of Nirvana.  Which you can't have a Nirvana reunion.  That's what we said.  But no one looked at it as a Nirvana reunion.  No one.  And they've played together...  Here's the thing that the media just takes something and runs with it.  Right.  They've played together a bunch of times.  Those three guys? 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Like, Foo Fighters shows, you know, like, in-studio stuff.  Like, this was the first time they've played on national television with each other.  But even last year they played at, like, Foo Fighters shows.  Chris Novoselic did bass on the last Foo Fighters record.  If...  I don't know.  So it's really not a big deal.  If they sang a Nirvana song, then maybe...  That would be different.  Maybe it would be slightly different.  Yeah, they didn't even do that.  But it's a song that has nothing to do with Kurt Cobain.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  Paul McCartney is, what, the lead singer of the new Nirvana?  Yeah.  Shut up, Courtney.  Stop.  Stop.  Some people are calling it Servana.  Ugh.  Really?  Oh, God, that's the douchiest.  You don't like that one?  Ugh, Servana.  I kind of got a douche chill when Paul McCartney said a reunion or something.  Because we all know it wasn't.  It's no reunion.  Anyone that was a fan of the band knows that.  Shut up, Courtney Love.  It's just three guys playing together.  Your daughter hates you. 
[00:57:00]  Shut up.  Frances Bean?  Frances Bean can't stand you.  Shut up.  Frances Bean.  Didn't she divorce her or something?  She tried to, yeah.  She did one of those kid things, really.  Like, when the kid's got to go to court, that's bad.  With a briefcase.  Yeah, yeah.  I want to divorce my parents.  If your kid's got to court with a briefcase to get away from you, you're fucked up.  You fucked up.  You fucked up.  God, I would be so pissed if one of my kids wanted to divorce me.  Oh, my God.  Really?  Fucking.  What the fuck?  They got fucking files coming into court with. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, like, every kid at some point hates their parents, and they're like, ah.  Yeah, sure.  But, like, to actually.  Like, say, I don't.  Yeah.  I got to take legal fucking action here to get away from you.  I need a lawyer.  I need a lawyer to get away from you.  It's never because of any type of real abuse.  It's just because.  They're assholes.  They're just assholes.  The kids are assholes.  Yeah, with, like, physical.  The parents are assholes.  Physical abuse or mental abuse, even, you could go to, like, law enforcement.  Right.  And shit like that.  This is like, I got to divorce you because you are a fucking asshole. 
[00:58:00]  Right.  Because you didn't get me that.  Out of your mind.  Yeah.  You didn't get me that pony.  It's always over something dumb.  A pony.  Who are some of the people that divorced their parents?  Gary Coleman.  Gary Coleman divorces parents?  That's the famous one.  A lot of those child stars that are getting ripped off by their parents.  Didn't Macaulay Culkin do something?  I think so, yeah.  Macaulay.  I swear to God, Steve Buscemi and Macaulay Culkin are the same guy now.  Wow.  And they're separated by, what, 30, 25 years probably?  Probably. 
[00:58:30]  Hmm.  I never noticed that.  Oh, yeah.  Show the cracked out.  Okay.  Yeah, a little bit.  Geez, yeah.  Wow, Macaulay Culkin.  What happened to the cute little kid that smacked his cheeks and went, ah, ah.  It was 25 years ago.  Oh, it was?  That's what happened.  Oh, okay.  Maybe 20 years.  I don't know.  Oh, I didn't realize.  How old is that movie now, Home Alone?  I think 91.  91.  Wow.  That is 20 years.  That's like, that's the fucking 80s. 
[00:59:00]  91 is still the 80s.  Right.  So that was an 80s movie.  1990.  That's the 70s.  That was the first movie I was allowed to go to by myself.  Did you bring your cat?  Was your hair blonde?  No, my parents dropped me and my brother off, and we saw the movie by ourself.  Did you feel like big boys?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We heard the movie by ourself.  Getting used to, your mom was getting used to dropping you off and leaving you by yourself,  I guess.  Yeah, of course.  Then you got the Buscemi. 
[00:59:30]  See, it's, you know, there's-  Oh, there is something there.  Yeah.  There is something in the wrong with these two now.  Oh, man.  Well, that's what happens with celebrities.  You can pick a few and they start, you know, becoming the one.  Like, Christina Aguilera, I've said it on Twitter.  That's Snooki with blonde hair.  That is fucked up, right?  It's really fucked.  She used to be so fucking hot.  Oh, my God.  And now she's Snooki.  What'd she do to herself?  She plumped up.  So she got a little bigger, a little fatter, let's say, but it looks like she had work 
[01:00:00]  in her face to the point where it's just too puffy.  Dude.  That's a-  She doesn't look like Snooki.  She's getting a Snooki look to her.  Yeah, but she's fine to other pictures.  She looks too good in that picture.  That was a good day for her.  But in general, man, she just, she used to be so hot.  Yeah.  Show her in the hot face.  Oh, my God.  Let's see what she, uh, you know, to just put in Maxim. 
[01:00:30]  That was, like, the issue.  Yeah.  That's not, that's not her.  That's a completely different person we're looking at.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  All right.  We got Joe DeRosa coming in today.  Joe.  And next week, let's not forget, we got Joe Rogan.  Joe.  Coming for his annual visit.  That's very nice of Joe.  Coming in for a little checkup, are you, Joe?  Yeah.  I guess it's going to be in town.  Checking in with the boys.  Going to be in town, is he?  That's great. 
[01:01:00]  We love Joe Rogan.  And Judd Apatow.  Oh, that's right.  I got to see that movie.  All right.  Which one is that?  This is 40.  This is 40.  Does it look good?  Yeah.  That's like the, it's a sort of sequel to Knocked Up.  Really?  Really?  What do you mean sort of sequel?  Stars the same people, right?  They're not using the Seth Rogen characters.  They're focusing more on the Leslie May and Paul Rudd storyline.  Oh, Paul Rudd's in this movie?  Uh-huh.  Thank God!  It just sounds great. 
[01:01:30]  I was just, I was just, I was just thinking I haven't seen Paul Rudd in too many comedies  lately.  Thank fucking God!  A lot of stuff going on in here.  A lot of, uh, a lot of things being not said.  Oh, yeah.  What are you talking about?  Paul Rudd?  Yeah.  Amazing in every fucking comedy movie he's in.  Yeah?  Terrific.  Oh, absolutely.  Look, plays the same guy in every movie, but.  Makes it work.  But makes it work.  There you go.  That's what I was trying to say. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, I agree.  What's the matter with your voice?  Fantastic.  Who are you?  It's mine on your nose?  Who are you?  Oh, nothing.  Oh.  Judd Apatow's wife in this one?  Yeah, she's the lead.  She's the lead.  Are they married?  Yeah, Leslie Manning.  Judd Apatow?  She plays very different roles in those movies, too, man.  But it's a sequel.  She's playing the same role.  It's the same character.  No, she plays different roles every time she's on screen. 
[01:02:30]  Very different every time.  Look, man, if you've got a formula, what the fuck?  Might as well go for it, right?  Why fuck with it?  Why fuck with it?  Really?  Paul Rudd, though.  Wow.  Thank God.  He is a powerhouse.  Yeah.  He's the original Mike Birbiglia.  He's getting clueless.  What?  He was getting clueless.  All right.  Oh, the brother that wanted to fuck his sister.  Josh.  What?  I'm the only one that likes Paul Rudd? 
[01:03:00]  I love Paul Rudd.  All right.  I love Judd Apatow.  Where are the Paul Rudd fans?  It's because it goes without saying.  Oh, okay.  He was Phoebe's boyfriend in Friends.  Wow.  He was great in Anchorman.  Yeah, see?  Who?  Paul Rudd.  Paul Rudd.  See?  And he'll be great in Anchorman, too.  Another comedy.  Comedy.  Let's see the trailer.  Comedy.  I'm going to get the official trailer.  You're not even playing the trailer.  Huh?  I don't know what he's doing.  Paul Rudd's terrific, man.  This guy. 
[01:03:30]  Fuck.  Yeah, he's fantastic.  I like Paul Rudd.  I love Paul Rudd.  I don't like him.  Why does it say 38 and not 40?  Because your mom wants to be 38.  Let's not mention it again.  Ah!  I don't know if you were born in 1974, but your paper, it said 72.  It's 1974.  Oh, wait.  On your last form, you said that you were born in 1975.  I've been working on my rewrite.  I lie about my age, okay?  Okay.  Okay?  Okay.  Okay.  I know.  I'm counting the rings.  I've made a list. 
[01:04:00]  It's the do-better list.  We're 40 years old.  If we don't do it now, when are we going to do it?  Your eyes are kind of glazing over.  No, no.  I'm just processing it.  We have to exercise every day.  I have turned your body into a boner machine.  Everyone gives you a boner.  Don't sell yourself short.  Mark is not that hard.  We have to get more involved in school. 
[01:04:30]  Your son said some offensive things about my daughter.  Oh, really?  He better get her meds right.  Excuse me?  Your kid is an animal.  He insults my daughter again.  He's so sorry.  They're touching my nipple.  I got right below your shoulder.  I have very high nipples.  I have to have my cushions with the kids.  And we have decided to cut back on all of the electronics we use.  What?  You need to get outside more.  You could build a fort.  Do what in the fort?  You need to develop your imagination.  You don't need technology.  No technology.  Sure, I can go down.  We're in it together. 
[01:05:00]  We're a team.  I need you to look at something.  Can we just keep a small shred of mystery in our relationship?  I saw you have babies.  Stay back.  That song.  Set the world on fire.  You like fun?  The laughter makes it really more funny.  Well, look.  The laughter was in the trailer.  That's what you're going to hear in the theater. 
[01:05:30]  And the theater.  You know, she does play a different role in this movie.  It's a sequel.  She's literally playing the same character.  No, it's a little different.  I'm a big Jet Apatow fan.  So am I.  So am I.  Anchorman.  Can't go wrong with Paul Rudd.  I don't mind Paul Rudd.  No?  Neither do I.  It's great. 
[01:06:00]  He's made a career for himself.  Sure has.  It's funny.  For getting Sarah Marshall, he had a little bit part.  Oh, he did?  He's a surf instructor.  Yeah, he played a little different role in that one.  Bad memory.  I think he grew his hair out a little bit for that one.  For that role.  I think he just grew his hair out.  Oh.  My idiot brother. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, he was a little different in that movie, right?  Steve Carell, right?  No.  No?  My point is this.  You're for schmucks.  Look.  My point is this.  He's like Ben Stiller.  Funny?  No, they just play the same fucking guy in every fucking movie.  Tony Kirk.  The exact same guy.  That fucking Ben Stiller.  We had him in.  He's funny, man.  He's been in some great movies.  Meet the Parents.  Hilarious.  Remember Meet the Parents?  What a guy. 
[01:07:00]  Was it called Meet the Parents or was that the sequel?  No, it was Meet the Parents, then Meet the Fockers, and then Little Fockers.  Right.  He just fucking is not a fun guy.  Zoolander?  You know how dull he is?  He was great.  We had him in studio, and I completely forgot until you guys brought it up yesterday.  Yeah.  And he's like a giant A-lister, and you would remember that.  I'm still trying to remember what happened.  You know, I have a picture with Ben Stiller that I never posted because I'm wearing a really  tight shirt that day, and my nipples are sticking out. 
[01:07:30]  That was a day I think I realized I got to stop wearing mediums.  Maybe I should post a picture now that I made it this thing.  Ben Stiller day.  Fuck, why can't I post my Ben Stiller picture?  Oh, yeah.  It looks like I got tits, and I'm not wearing a bra.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Ben Stiller, I mean, he could be funny in movies.  I won't front yo.  So, but in real life, every time I've seen him, he's a fucking douche. 
[01:08:00]  Well, Mr. Serious.  What movie was he funny in?  Heavyweights.  Mystery Men.  Zoolander.  Zoolander was good.  Dodgeball.  Dodgeball.  Dodgeball.  Technically, Dodgeball was the exact same character as Heavyweights.  Of course it was.  That's my point.  Sam's favorite movie.  He's one of those guys that plays the exact same fucking guy in every movie. 
[01:08:30]  But Heavyweights is fucking awesome.  And then every once in a while he'll go off script a little bit and do like a Zoolander  or something.  Starsky and the Rich.  Huh?  You know who wrote Heavyweights?  What?  Judd Apatow.  Judd Apatow is terrific.  Oh, yeah.  He's coming in.  Please tell him about Heavyweights.  Maybe not.  Yeah, we could do that.  Yeah.  Except the world on fire.  I, uh...  What?  You like fun?  Yeah.  They're fun.  Could you take us to break with some fun?  Do I have to? 
[01:09:00]  How about that?  Yeah, man.  It's Friday.  Uh, let me find it.  Just, you know, switch it up a little, Iraq.  Fair enough, sir.  Why don't you play a deep cut from Fun?  Oh, my God.  How awful would that be?  Uh, Judd.  I listen to the Fun album.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's terrible.  Is it?  It's like show tunes.  It's nominated for, like, best record of the year.  It's like show tunes.  It's like that dumb My Chemical Romance theme album.  Really?  My Chemical Romance theme?  Yeah, but My Chemical Romance at least rocks. 
[01:09:30]  No.  How hard are they rock, though?  They don't rock.  They have, like, a medium rock.  They don't rock?  But Fun just seems like...  Shit.  What bands?  This is like Queen.  If this song is in one more commercial, you'll know the chorus.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  From commercials.  Yes.  Just need a little Brian May guitar, and now we're talking here.  It's very Queen.  Of course it is.  All right, we'll figure something out for the next break.  I want to hear what the chorus is. 
[01:10:00]  You've heard it.  Because I've heard it in commercials?  Yes.  I'm Mr. Commercial.  What do I stand for?  What do I stand for?  Yeah?  Oh, I've heard this.  Yes.  Can I just go to break?  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  This is the Opian Anthony Channel.

[01:15:00]  so no no no he orchestrates the whole heist all right it's a it's a comedy of errors yeah but it's  i'd like to throw this coffee on you oh that's what it is look tropic uh tropic thunder he was he  was really good in tropic thunder because he didn't play that dopey fucking oh uh heartbreak kid  it's happening heartbreak kid thank you that was the one with jeff raniston where it was pretty much  heartbreak that was a long game poly royal tannenbaums too i love a long game poly though 
[01:15:30]  it's one of my favorite movies royal tannenbaums it really is that's about a fucking shitty movie  oh my god what a bore fest royal tannenbaums bore fest that's all right that movie yeah why do you  think a long game poly is one of your dude philip seymour hoffman off the charts in that movie  first he's great in everything he does he's one of those actors even in a bad movie you're okay  because you're gonna get to see a great performance uh i like romantic comedies philip seymour hoffman's 
[01:16:00]  larry's in it oh god really are you surprised at this point fan of the rom-com uh are you at this  point they don't hurt anybody rom-coms but i don't go search them out i don't search them out but i  enjoy five rom-coms you liked well it's christmas time so love actually is at the top of the list this  year look out uh i love a long came poly okay uh i loved annie hall that's a romantic comedy  annie hall is a lot deeper than a a run-of-the-mill rom-com don't you think uh i mean i didn't say 
[01:16:30]  you gotta always go running in that movie's terrific modern romance i wouldn't say the  writing in a long came poly is terrific no it's not terrific i think it's really funny and i think  jennifer aniston is as close to a perfect woman as you could imagine in that film not gonna argue  i like the jennifer aniston yeah she's she's she's a very funny broad she's great in that movie and uh  what's uh what's it called is in it um what else was i gonna say about it the uh 
[01:17:00]  sam has started the list the ben stiller awkward character so we got meet the parents he did that  three times night at the museum was twice right night at the museum same fucking character but now  it's in a museum same character just in a museum along came poly same fucking character but that's  the single version of that character right yeah something about mary something about something  about mary same fucking character right uh what's that must be nice you don't even have to move 
[01:17:30]  around your acting skills just play the same fucking role that's what happens to everybody they did it  with vince vaughn too i love vince vaughn but it's like i can't watch it anymore right it's too much  heartbreak kid there's definitely more in there do you put royal tannenbaums down oh yeah does that  count royal tannenbaums oh it's so dull are you not a wes anderson man no you're not cool enough to  understand i know i'm not you know it i like tannenbaums he lost me at steve zuzu but then i came 
[01:18:00]  you didn't like the zuzu i thought that movie stunk but i i really like moonrise kingdom i thought that  was really good yeah yeah because he finally figured out not to make a movie two and a half  hours long i was like yeah 90 minutes in and out yeah that's enough fucking quirky bill murray  that's all i need is 90 minutes 90 minutes of quirky bill murray is about the limit yeah yeah it used  to be goofy bill murray and great comedies and now we get the the quirky guy thanks bill yeah thanks 
[01:18:30]  for that we really appreciate it furious that he's that they made that movie where he plays  roosevelt but you can't right fucking bill murray i know who that is  okay so maybe tower tower is i'm telling you it's not he's not awkward in traffic thunder is definitely  in the dumb and egotistical category you think it's the same okay yeah man all right dodgeballs in the 
[01:19:00]  uh i got for that one i got zoolander dodgeball heavyweights and tropic thunder dodgeball he's  over the top it's the same exact character as heavyweights and zoolander right that's what we're  saying over the top the dumb and anchor man he's in that category too is he is he the he's the head  of the spanish station he's the uh the anchor oh right he's a dodgeball character again yeah yeah  pretty much yeah see there you go he plays two fucking guys we're stuck with the two categories now  oh in madagascar he's one of the voices but he's awkward 
[01:19:30]  he's awkward he's he's even awkward as a cartoon character yeah his character is very insecure  how many how many madagascars have there been three oh four three in a christmas series four holy shit  uh ben stiller did one great movie according to jd in new york city who i like he says he played a  heroin addicted writer based on a true story in permanent midnight great flick he's great in that 
[01:20:00]  never saw it he's great in that man he plays a real fucking scumbag in it yeah all right he's  that's the thing with all these guys they're all capable of playing other stuff it's just that's  what the business does they they scare the shit out of you you start making tons of movies for  security and that's it and then you play the same same character that all that fucking different  movies yeah strike while the iron's hot like all that fucking nonsense unfortunately i missed envy  but based on the poster and the fact that he co-starred with jack black he's probably the weird  awkward one yeah let's just put it okay let's just assume let's just assume on that one oh jack black 
[01:20:30]  is terrific though you like jack black oh he's amazing oh absolutely amazing in everything he does  it's not too over the top you like that sometimes understated yes just enough just enough craziness  the subtlety yuck you're in a tear today but no i'm just sick of that shit what what uh who else 
[01:21:00]  don't you like make a list oh my god yes how many hours do you have no i want to know who else don't  you like jack black let's see jack black there's uh kung fu panda right not too over the top in that  movie no no uh he doesn't have crazy eyes he's same fucking guy voice in the video game brutal legend  the rock and roll video game oh was that when he showed up at like a hollywood function as the  character or something we made fun of that yeah yeah yeah he basically plays the tenacious d guy in 
[01:21:30]  that movie tenacious d is another one tropic thunder it's kind of the same thing yeah he was a little  a little crazy in that movie crazy he makes some crazy eyes yeah tilt his head back and sideways a  little make some crazy eyes trying to do some of those old school belushi faces yeah oh great when  belushi did it it was good yeah belushi stunk nope can we please go on record finally somebody  fucking can we talk about how much belushi absolutely stunk you know what i'm gonna drastically 
[01:22:00]  changed my opinion right on the spot i think you might be right oh yeah i think you might be right  he was he animal house he didn't talk he was barely in animal house by the way he did some physical  fucking comedy for everybody that wasn't his movie he's he is so little he's at such a small part in  animal house that's like when you go into walmart and you see that like de niro three pack and they  fucking dug up three movies deer deer deer in 1967 you're like what the fuck is this that's what 
[01:22:30]  animal house is like for belushi he's he stinks uh you get to dress up like a samurai  it's not fucking funny well he's the stinks he's detached from the uh the rest of the movie  almost like they brought him in to do a they did around a little bit right that's exactly what they  yeah he had nothing to do with the storyline no he was a peripheral character yeah he doesn't 
[01:23:00]  carry that movie not at all here's belushi uh neighbors foreigner costume grunting and moaning  or uh repeats one phrase over and over again cheeseburger cheeseburger yeah that's all belushi  he ever did cheeseburger cheeseburger cheeseburger or hiya that's all he did repeat phrase over and  over again or fat guy grunting then like his joe cocker impression he just grunts at it right yeah 
[01:23:30]  that was pretty good though his joe cocker was grunts what's it going he did i think he did very  well on snl it was just like was he that great in blues brothers do we remember he's funny in blues  brothers but i mean it's like he's not fucking comedic genius funny animal house what other movies  1941 was kind of a bust yeah continental divide continental divide and neighbors that's it well  he never really had a chance now did he no here's what it is it was 1976 5 7 whatever it was right 
[01:24:00]  uh everybody's doing blow he's in the right fucking circle so all these famous people start  going what a fucking guy this guy's a riot he probably was a riot to fucking do blow with and  watch him fucking piss in a bush and puke on himself and whatever else it sounds like a fucking ball yeah  it's hilarious and then everybody goes we love this guy so now he's going to be a genius you know  what i mean that's how that always that's how that works with a lot of these guys because he dropped 
[01:24:30]  dead yeah he might have been a little overrated i think john candy and chris farley blew him away  like no contest those two blew him away chris farley is like is like hilariously fucking funny  yeah he made a lot of shitty movies but he's fucking hilariously funny but i mean belushi had a good run  on snl that's for sure did you ever watch those old snls no they're dog shit they bomb dude they  bomb they just it's it's kind of scared to talk badly about belushi i'll be honest with you 
[01:25:00]  a lot of a lot of people hold them up to a high standard i think sometimes you got to take things  in the context of time there joe now the mid-70s like that that type of uh you know kind of uh off  the cuff comedy thing and kind of that wacky doesn't really have to be like traditional comedy  was pretty big you know yeah you know why why because everybody was on blow that's all you had  to do to make people laugh hey guys i'm gonna i'm gonna put on this samurai suit and fucking 
[01:25:30]  make a sandwich with a sword so it worked though stinks at the time and look at like ronan martin's  laughing was the same thing for the 60s like like that shit you would not find funny now but back then  people were fucking roaring laughing but here's the thing you lived in the 60s holy no no i i i do  remember being a tiny a child you're a child of the 60s tiny child and i would sneak out of my room 
[01:26:00]  and peek around the corner to watch ronan martin's laughing i did that with the cosby show you did  yeah i was a little too young for the cosby show but i definitely i took a peek from the top of the  stairs yeah i did that with friends oh there you go i remember uh watching uh ronan martin's laughing  and um it would be so cool to to kind of chuckle along with that until um i would hear my parents  start to argue on the couch and uh get into a yelling match and then i would just go back to my bed and 
[01:26:30]  cry so every time you hear here come the judge now you start crying yes yes where where are we at  with friends good show uh you know what i like the first time all the time now man you can't get  away from that show in syndication i think it was funny it got away from itself toward the end but  yeah i thought it was funny i don't think it was a bad show i don't like it i never liked it never  liked it why i always thought it was stupid why was it stupid i don't know it just looked like they 
[01:27:00]  could afford that place i mean there's a new york city and what that was believable they talked about  that a lot on the show though they talked about how three of them had really good jobs  and the other three didn't but what were the good jobs i don't know i just remember an episode  where like they talked like three of them had to confront the other thing they were like  you guys you just you know you give us like these crazy presents on our birthday and we can't afford  to do that like it makes us feel very awkward they talked about some of them had a lot of money  and the other ones did okay wait can i speak to your his point though oh which point now the thing 
[01:27:30]  you just said about the laugh in yeah oh yeah here's the thing though when i watch last i hear what  you're saying i can watch it and go oh it's dated or whatever but i watch it i go i see the jokes  oh okay i see what's funny there it's like just like i can watch certain old snl stuff i i don't  think now like i think dan akroyd's funny but like now i'm like i don't think it's as funny as i did  when i was a kid right because it's dated now but when i see it i go i see the fucking joke like i see  what the funny is here the fucking cheeseburger cheeseburger that's not funny like it's just funny for 
[01:28:00]  the time why were they why was it it was funny for the time i know why because back then back  then it was all about the catchphrases or you know it's something you could go to school the next day  and repeat right so so you're going cheeseburger cheeseburger to your friends and like oh my god  it's hilarious so you might be right in a way i'm telling you dude if you're fucking but dan  akroyd was like a god on that show and now you look at him like just a silly like i don't think many  people would consider him a funny he's not a funny guy he does alien shows but on snl right into that 
[01:28:30]  but on snl man he was a god when he comes back like he comes back sometime when he came back in  the 90s he was still fucking hilarious what was it what he came back and hosted and he did tom  snyder and oh oh you mean on snl tom snyder bit was great yeah uh when he did that uh what was it  frank or fred garvin male prostitute yeah male prostitute used to do nixon like that shit was good  he did characters i'm telling you if it's a saturday at 1977 it's a saturday night you got 
[01:29:00]  some fucking tush over at your place you're blowing lines off a fucking monopoly board  and you're drunk and you see some fatso going cheeseburger you're going  fucking right oh man you just fucked up man i think i think you might be right i think you might  be right here bring back the cheeseburger cheeseburger to this snl because this snl stinks  i don't like drunk uncle uncle on the 12 12 12 concert drunk uncle no was it funny 
[01:29:30]  terrible dude it was so bad as a stand-up you should be very pissed what's drunk i don't even  know what that is it's one of their uh benchmark i guess characters on the new snl and they brought  it up brought him up in between you know the big x and he got to perform in front of two billion  people it could be the the biggest bombing ever got nothing and it it was so bad replay it for joe  please you didn't see the 12 12 12 concert i saw some of it i was at a christmas party so i was  catching like glimpses of it i didn't see the whole thing a little social butterfly look at you 
[01:30:00]  we all goofed on it but it was it was good it was a good concert it was cool to check out  yeah i'd love to uh see it but that's a drunk uncle bit that drunk uncle bit was so bad went nowhere  in front of two billion people this is what lauren michaels decided to give uh the 12 12 12 concert  yeah they could have they could have used anything you got to think it was lauren michaels decision  they probably went to him said look you got a few minutes what do you want to do and they and he 
[01:30:30]  said let's uh send drunk uncle who does the character he's a new guy and bobby moynihan that guy's  funny man well get where this bit huh oh jesus i've seen him be funny on the show when he does  a cheeseburger cheeseburger i think fred armison's really funny yeah the portlandia guy yeah i wouldn't  argue that point he's really funny yeah definitely a lot of people say an old snl is unwatchable  dude it's terrible that show here's the thing that show has never been home run funny there's a 
[01:31:00]  percentage of certain seasons that's fucking great but when you watch even when people talk about like  the like the the dana carvey years like that's the best cast probably you talk about that you go  back and you watch the full episodes there is significant amounts of bombing they're turning  at a 90 minute show in four days it's like all right all right with that said yeah who had the  best average in snl history i think i think that there was a there was like a two-year period during 
[01:31:30]  that day so dana carvey oh you mean a person i want an individual dana carvey phil hartman  not yeah phil hartman will farrell yeah will farrell on that list when they first got will  farrell and sherry o'tary and all them that was a pretty good goddamn uh cast yeah yeah yeah but  yeah i mean but i mean those seasons dude they rerun those all the time yeah you watch them they're  a lot of shit in there it's terrible yeah except for when will farrell comes out like with the  beard on going oh i want to have sex with you inside a zebra okay man whatever that guy that 
[01:32:00]  he does yeah and i took my lover and we ate lots of meat and we made love that's really funny  he probably had the best average on that show yeah that's batting out dana carvey's way up there  i mean i saw there um you know what even though he didn't they didn't use him a lot but every time  norm mcdonald was yeah skit or did anything i like norm in the skit because it's like he didn't 
[01:32:30]  belong in the skit took you right out of the skit but made you laugh really hard yeah he just it's  just norm he's so funny norm mcdonald he's so funny i watch uh i watch all of his uh dennis miller  remember when dennis miller that talk show on hbo i go but i go on youtube a lot and watch all the  norm mcdonald interviews he fucking kills well like famous bit from fucking the the gay the gay son bit  oh jesus can we play that god damn funny let's just play a lot is that you know yay we'll play 
[01:33:00]  that break i'm proud of you know my my gay son yeah oh yeah he loves cock i love that let's play  it right now we're not doing this thing in san francisco and they were all gay uh people in  the audience they told me so i figured out in san francisco no so i figured i'd do stuff about  gay people so that they could relate to that's warm up they love that and so i was talking about  because i went to this gay pride parade and i saw in it there were these uh old men and old ladies 
[01:33:30]  like with these uh signs that said we are proud of our gay son you know and so i was saying that's an  odd thing to be proud of you know because it's not an achievement you know it's not like something  you work all your life to be gay or anything like that and i i just wondered i just i i had a hard  time believing that these 50 60 year old men are actually bragging you know i worked like they're  hey uh bill you know uh my kid oh my god we're proud of him johnny he uh graduated from harvard you 
[01:34:00]  know the first in his class you know i mean now he's articling over at a law firm and uh oh yeah he  loves cock  he can't get enough cock in his mouth his ass his kids always cook  i got a picture of the boy here sucking another man's cock  to watch the maturation of you as an artist to realize it took you nine and a half minutes to get around to the 
[01:34:30]  sucking cock stuff it's brilliant it's beautiful to see you comfortable in your own skin normie  all right that is so fucking up dennis what a great setup god i hated him  not into the dennis miller  hey i like it he makes me laugh normie no when he toned down all that other shit yes he is a funny guy 
[01:35:00]  but he tried too hard with all those big words well you know the guy's acting like pericles on a  trapeze and it's like okay chico chico right chico but it does bring up a good point about norm  mcdonald being comfortable in his skin because his his he's long-winded but it's funny like no one else  could pull that off oh man like there it almost feels like there's no direction to his story but  there there absolutely is and he knows exactly where he's going but that that ride is a little 
[01:35:30]  swervy yeah i know i love it i loved all that it's very unique but his cadence and just the way  he's talking it's fucking great i love it i can listen to norm all day uh people saying eddie murphy  had a great batting average oh shit yeah actually oh murphy all right that he's number one he's gotta  be number one did he ever have a bad skid is the question here's the thing murphy was around as long  as like a phil hartman phil hartman put in some years will farrell put in some years well murphy was on  for two i think two seasons but here's the thing he was on during the two worst rated seasons ever 
[01:36:00]  that's true yeah but he was the fucking standout he saved that fucking show man he's on during the  two years after lauren michaels left in the 80s whenever they used to do those seasons were so bad  they used to do sketches about how bad the season was oh wow they would do they would really know your  shit yeah if like bill murray would come back and host they'd be like hey bill you know everybody says  we stink yeah you know compared to you guys because they were the second cast uh and it's  eddie murphy dude eddie murphy was the only guy that had the d the video remember in like in the 
[01:36:30]  80s when they put out best of eddie murphy saturday that was like 20 years where they gave anybody else  their own video it's him it's him it's him i put money on it it's got to be him yeah okay my friend  just texted me dude royal tenant bombs is great those guys shit on everything  fuck you  i bet he likes monty python too  ask your friend if he likes monty python  that royal 
[01:37:00]  i may believe i liked monty python in high school because i thought that would be you know that was  the cool thing can we please it felt like you were in a club like yeah man you get it yeah yeah i get it  i so get this monty python monty python  can suck the dead parrot out of my dick  that fucking show stunk  i made believe that  i was hanging with some of the more  quirkier like fucking  i don't know  kids and they were into monty python so i'm like yeah 
[01:37:30]  fuck this show's great that show stinks  the fucking jocks just don't get it  i uh listen i used to watch that  but in reality i was  i love dr domeno which is like the other side of the whole comedy fucking spectrum you know when i was in high school i couldn't get enough of dr domeno and his dumb songs  and i had to make believe i liked monty python how bad is that  i can't i can't go with you down that road  but i'll find  dr domeno  yeah  no is it  i mean for the time like ant was talking though for the time it was like when you 
[01:38:00]  when you had a dr domeno tape with like you know the new songs that this guy found  i don't know i liked it  ugh  hello mother  hello father  oh my god  all that shit  douche shells  that was douchey  but i i mean  he did the monster mash  but i  i did move past all that  i'm talking when i was like 16 17 18 years old tops  i just picture you showed up at a party i got a great party tape king  hey dr domeno 
[01:38:30]  there was another there was a guy that got the tapes and uh i was on the basketball team and when we would travel to our games we would crank up crank up  crank up dr domeno  on a boom box  to get hype for the game  i don't know it was just it was just one of the things that happened on the buzz  that's all  which one is this  it's your favorite  rapping duke  oh no the rapping duke  so you think you're bad 
[01:39:00]  with your rap  well i'll tell you  i started the crap  when you were in diapers  and wetting the sheets  i was at the ponderosa  rapping to the big  da  da  da  da  da  da  da  da  da  da  da  this was so bad  how douchey  this was a dr domeno staple  was it  oh yeah  god  the rapping duke  i'm talking fucking years ago  you know what  you know what  the curly shuffle 
[01:39:30]  beat me up if you have to  but i'm not talking about like i did this last year  the thing with mighty python  i thought bill bottoms were cool too  all right  all right fair enough  fuck  in the 80s  the thing with mighty python was  it was  it was the  it laid the foundation  mighty python laid the foundation for like  really funny  like mr show is really funny  kids in the hall  like that stuff's really funny  they like i get that mighty python laid the groundwork for that  like they were the first like sort of offbeat 
[01:40:00]  yeah  sketch thing  but it's the equivalent now of like when you go back and you try to listen to like hawk wind  as like the precursor to  and i love lemmy and motorhead but hawk wind is not that fun to listen to  not good  but it's like  i don't know what that is  you know what hawk wind is  i swear to god  it's lemmy  lemmy  not many people unless you're a motorhead fan  or lemmy fan really know that  i never really  i don't think so  really  i thought everybody knew hawk wind  i never searched out motorhead  when i hear motorhead i like it 
[01:40:30]  but i don't really know much  lemmy's a character we've had him on the show  we love him but  he's awesome  i just don't know much about the band  he's awesome  but uh hawk wind i feel did not showcase him  well it doesn't matter  i'm talking more about it now  you really know music though  you go deep with your music  i was just  you know what i thought you guys were going to know hawk wind  i swear to god  that was a great analogy  and now it fucking just fell in its face  no because i've never even heard the name of  i've never even heard the name of that band before  no  it was the band he was in before motorhead 
[01:41:00]  but the point is  they were like this space rocky  band from the 60s  and you could trace a lot back  and go  well that  kind of laid the groundwork  for these other groups in the 70s  right  but my point is  is like sometimes you go back  and you look at the groundwork  or the foundation  you go  it's just not that fun to listen to  yeah  you know what i mean  or or get into  that's how mighty python is  like i get what they were doing  and i appreciate it  but it's not that funny to me  you didn't like the ministry of uh  the silly walks  oh god  dead parrot  what was that 
[01:41:30]  yeah all i remember  dead parrot was fun  i'd like to have an argument  yeah  and then he pays the guy  and he starts arguing with him  and then he goes  time's up  and then he tries to argue with him  some more  but he doesn't pay him  so he doesn't argue with him  so he has to get  take some more money  and then he pays him  and he goes  he goes all right  an argument  and he goes  no i'm not gonna argue with you  look  look this is funny  go back  he was arguing on his spare time  right  he has a silly walk  yeah  i thought it was creepy 
[01:42:00]  how they went from video to film  when they went outside  it was a film  he's walking across the street  so  is that straight  this actually isn't bad  this isn't bad  for a comedy piece  it's like physical comedy  yes  and john cleese  is big and lanky  what's the hook of this though  the hook is that  he's 
[01:42:30]  he's an actual  he's walking to the ministry  of silly walks  so you don't know that yet  you're just like  what is he doing  oh it's a twist  see  ministry of silly walks  see the ministry of silly walks  and he goes in there  and everybody walks silly  walking down the hall now  all silly as shit  and then out  he passes other guys  walking silly as shit  oh  because it's a ministry  right  of silly walks  so there's a bunch of  silly walkers

[01:46:00]  i mean what happened man  kids used to dress up  for christmas  you know  before we opened prisons  we had to put on  tuxedos and a cake  we had to do it  nowadays  you can't even say  merry christmas anymore  you know  you gotta say  hey baby jesus  are you on foursquare  you know  wow  oh my god  is there a room  at the inn  with wifi  Netflix me

[01:47:00]  more of it  it never got better  it's hard to watch  to be honest with you  it's uncomfortable right  and he's like  well drunk uncle  right  what are you saying  drunk uncle  and I don't think  the you know  is part of his character  I think that's  him going  holy fuck  this isn't working  it's not where  it's like  it's  this is the thing  that bugs me too  about something like that  it's like  I get what the character is  and okay  it's funny  whatever  but it's like  that guy wouldn't  say foursquare  no 
[01:47:30]  you know little shit  like that bugs me  for some reason  I don't know why  it's just like  he wouldn't know  what the fuck  foursquare  I barely know  what foursquare is  you know  he wouldn't say  Netflix Q  no  yeah it's like  they write it  they write it in  like this super hip voice  and then they'd go  but I'll just  paint my hair gray  and do drunk  but that doesn't make it  your drunk uncle  wouldn't know about that  yeah  you know like  not only completely unfunny  but inaccurate  yeah  yeah I like to really  hone in on the 
[01:48:00]  stuff that's not that  fun to make fun of  you're right  that's the  well  we're gonna make fun  of Cat Williams next  oh yeah  ow  can I call it  can we make this  Dr. Domeno day  we had ACDC day  recently  can we do Dr. Domeno day  any requests  sure  Iraq knows the  Dr. Domeno  he's excited  is there an  give us some  give us some  choices here  is there an ACDC  Dr. Domeno spoof  of some kind  oh boy  some kind of  hard rock  spoof  spoof 
[01:48:30]  spoof  please play  hello mother  hello father  oh god  it makes me sick  wait wait no  what are all the  choices  his albums  aren't in here  you have to know  the artist  so I gotta  do some research  you gotta know  the artist  he made another  one Rides the Bus  famous by Weird Al  he broke Weird Al  he broke Weird Al  with that one  that's true  and unfortunately  we're still stuck  with Weird Al  I like Weird Al  I respect him  why  I don't think  it's funny anymore  but I respect him 
[01:49:00]  alright so that's  like what I thought  about Dr. Domeno  in general  maybe not the  respect part  but it was funny  at one time  for me  I don't listen  to Weird Al  on the way  to the game  on the bus  I also liked  Cheech and Chong  growing up  got all their  cassettes  they were cassettes  back then  and I  and I liked  George Carlin  right off the bat  love Carlin  so you know  George Carlin  and Dr. Domeno  in the same house  that's kind of stupid  obviously  can we talk  Cheech and Chong  for a minute  yes 
[01:49:30]  are they funny  that's another thing  I never got it  no  it's that weed humor  that was big  you know what though  I don't know  if they're funny anymore  I  they were huge though  they were doing  something right  I respect them  they're legends  I feel bad  at what I'm about  to say  I'm gonna just  say it though  Cheech is definitely  not funny  Cheech is not  I've watched  a lot of stuff  he's one of those guys  which was Cheech  the short one 
[01:50:00]  Mexican  oh that  that was in that  show with the other guy  Don Johnson  yeah  what show was that again  I never lost it  Nash Bridges  Cheech and Johnson  Cheech and Johnson  yeah  he  and then Chong  is like  Chong's the funny one  he wasn't funny  on our show  cause he's  fucking 80  he's 80  Edipod  he's the slowest man  on earth  yeah  they were great  to us actually  we had a lot of fun 
[01:50:30]  they both came in  so are they funny  like  they were  they were  you know  they're  legends  so  right  you know  it was just fun  to talk to them  I don't  I don't remember  anything that stood out  I'm trying to think  back at the movies  like they made  with the pot  up and smoke  and all  fucking up and smoke  up and smoke  up and smoke's pretty funny  yeah I think so  smoke is kind of funny man  I think so  but then that's it  still smoking  yeah  the Corsican Brothers  no  no  Cheech and Chong's  second movie  or whatever the fuck  that one was called 
[01:51:00]  no  if it's Dr. Domeno Day  Kevin came up with one  and yeah I want to play  this one  if it's okay with you guys  Kevin from Connecticut  says Fish Heads  let's do Fish Heads  if we're doing Dr. Domeno Day  that's terrible  fish heads  fish heads  why did people like this  holy holy fish heads  fish heads  fish heads  eat them up  yum  Saturday Night Live  made the video for this  did they  that's where it used to air  I love Dr. Domeno  radio  in the morning 
[01:51:30]  laughing happy fish  that guy's always  who actually wrote this too  who  Jay from Lost in Space  Will Robinson  from Lost in Space  he wrote this  Billy Moomy  yes  what happened to that guy  I don't know  last I saw it  was in  like  Twilight Zone movie  years ago  oh  he played the  little redhead kid  in Lost in Space  but isn't he the kid  in It's a Wonderful Life  the kid that sends you  to the field 
[01:52:00]  or whatever  yeah yeah  the original Twilight Zone  yeah  and then he was in the  like restaurant bar area  or something  in the remake  of that same episode  and when they did  the Forrest Whitaker  Twilight Zone  they did a sequel  to It's a Wonderful Life  where he's all grown up in it  and it's about him  with his daughter  oh really  that was one of the only  good episodes of that  fucking stinking  shithouse  re-fucking boot  they did  I hated the reboots  of Twilight Zone  and Outer Limits  and all that shit  they were terrible  I like season one  of the 80s reboot  Twilight Zone  seasons two and three stink  and the Forrest Whitaker one  was fucking unacceptably bad 
[01:52:30]  you're a very lonely man  yeah I got nothing  you have a lot of time  he's like yeah I got nothing  you have a lot of time  yeah  you can watch a lot of stuff  yeah I got nothing going on  I gotta get married  Fred in Jersey says  he likes Drunk Uncle  yeah I wanted to defend  Drunk Uncle  it wasn't funny  at the benefit  but on Weekend Update  every week  it's actually a pretty funny character  he's drinking scotch  and I don't know  it's not bad  you should watch  some of the in-studio stuff  I will try the in-studio stuff  just to be fair 
[01:53:00]  should we?  that was a huge  fucking bomb  the other night  there should never be comedy  at an event like that  no  Fallon's thing  fucking fell flat too  when he goes  I gotta tweet this  he really thought  that was gonna get  a huge cheer  yeah but what was he  going for there  I was a little confused  the whole character  is like nostalgia  in like how the past  was better  but he's hammered  the whole time  I don't know  it's pretty funny  you should check out  the in-studio stuff  I don't know  it's also just like  a sort of like  half 
[01:53:30]  first of all  we've all seen  this character before  I'm not trying to shit  on Bobby Moyni  he's a funny guy  but like  we've seen that character before  and Dana Carvey  did it in the 90s  remember Dana Carvey  wouldn't we liked it  when he did the old man thing  and I watched an interview  recently with Dana Carvey  where he actually said  he goes  my whole thing was  old people acted like  they always act like  it was like this back then  and it sucked  he's like  but he goes  but my character was like  it was horrible  when I was growing up  but I actually loved it 
[01:54:00]  and that's kind of  what the  drunk uncle  it's just another variation  of that  it's like you know  alright  well let's  let's see a little of  oh my god  we're still talking about  drunk uncle  well now in context  of the show  Sam is this good  no  alright  the caller was wrong  it is good  hold on  shut up we're listening  just watch the first  I just watched the first 15 seconds  and you tell me  if I'm  if I'm judging too harshly  family members  here with an election recap  drunk uncle  alright  that's a good topic 
[01:54:30]  big uncle Sam hat on  I want my  country back  country back  country back  I want my country back  chilies  that's where I drink  and then I get drunk  that's kind of funny  no  not at all  no it's not  I found no humor in that  wait  I was getting mad  but also too  you don't want to be mad  you're not even trying  you want to talk  yeah  that's not funny  you want to talk about  let's start  hold on 
[01:55:00]  let's try another 15 seconds  okay  let's do some 15 seconds  okay  so uh  so drunk uncle  I assume  you're not pleased  with the outcome  you think  people  people don't even  dress up for an election  anymore Seth  you know  back  back when I was a kid  you couldn't vote  unless you had  suspenders  cane  monocle  top half fancy  that must be  one of the bits  one of the  you know  he must always say 
[01:55:30]  that's his van  by the river  yeah  they used to  dress up  but nobody would  ever talk like that  that's not an  every week thing  he just reused it  shut up  who is this  drunk uncle  are you drunk uncle  oh look  it's  it's  it's  it's  it's  it's  it's  it's  it's  it's  it's  it's  it's  it's  it's  it's  it's  it's  it's  it's  it's  it's  it's  it's  it's  it's  but I mean  look  you were talking  about rehashing  whatever  two years ago  they had that guy  that did  drunk girl  at the party 
[01:56:00]  that would come out  a weekend update  and go  excuse me  this year  now  right now  they do  the drunk girl  that you don't want  to get stuck  talking to  at a party  that's another  character they do  it's the same  fucking thing  as this  and  I want my country  fucking Mike Myers  come on man  that's like  my guy's in  Austin Powers  five or six  years ago  yes  he was the guy  that did the  play on  10 years ago  yeah actually  Jesus Christ  this guy just loves

[02:06:00]  You go a little too deep for my taste  As far as talking about it on the radio  Yeah, it's, you know  Look, a lonely man has time to delve and explore  But what about other stuff we thought was funny  And just isn't  And isn't?  Yeah  We really hit all my big ones at last block  There were some albums growing up  That was like  The National Lampoon albums  And those weird kind of  God, what was 
[02:06:30]  There was some other like comedy groups  Who would put together these albums  And they weren't good  They were not  They were not  They were not  They were not  They were not  They were not  Was National Lampoon's ever funny  Or did they just get lucky with those vacation movies  I think  Yeah  They put out a lot of shit  They put out a lot of crap  A lot of shit  The magazine though  Like when you graduated from Mad Magazine  To National Lampoon  Was Mad Magazine funny?  Mad Magazine  Yeah  As a kid  I think it is  Okay  I still think it is  As a kid it was the funniest fucking thing ever  Right  But I kind of 
[02:07:00]  Then you kind of graduated to National Lampoon  And that shit used to have me in tears  I was laughing my fucking ass off  Mad  Mad is still  I was reading Mad  I was reading Mad that came out like a few months ago  And they had a Ben and Jerry spoof  It was called Ben and Jerry's Dingleberry  Where?  White marshmallows and chocolate ice cream  Wait that magazine is fucking hilarious  That magazine is still around?  Yeah they still make it  But it's like quarterly now man  Like it's really spaced out  Yeah  Oh that's too bad  What did they have in National Lampoon's?  Like what kind of stuff was it? 
[02:07:30]  I never read it  It was just kind of  It was a lot of parody  It was kind of like The Onion a little bit  But they wrote like it was supposed to be a serious magazine for the most part  And just did a great job of spoofing and parodying everything  So it was like fake news stories and shit like that?  To a point  Then they would have like stories of  They'd have like short stories too that you would read about  Like O.C. and Stiggs were a couple of characters 
[02:08:00]  And it was almost like a National Lampoon Animal House-ish kind of thing  And there would be stories about what they would do  And go out and fucking raise some havoc  Who were O.C. and Stiggs?  Just two characters that were in there  But like what kind of characters were there?  Sort of  Beavis and Butthead-ish  Okay  Yeah  They would kind of be stories of what they would do  Okay  It was funny  Alright  And there were like a lot of  Like maybe shit that you'd see in a technical magazine  Or popular mechanics 
[02:08:30]  But it was  Totally didn't make sense  And it was explained really funny  I just  I thought it was a very funny magazine  Alright  Very well  They don't make it anymore though, right?  No  That shit's long gone  It's out  We gotta get into Cat Williams  Oh yeah  Cat Williams  I'm with you motherfuckers  Oh, roll with me motherfuckers  He's losing his mind  I guess he had an incident in Seattle  He did  More's coming out about the incident  And he just fucking lost it  This is where he got arrested, right? 
[02:09:00]  A series of incidents in Seattle  But now there's other stuff coming out about the arrest  What happened or whatever?  More details, sure  Okay, great  Stand-up comic Cat Williams has had a controversial visit to Seattle  The past few days  And tonight he's telling us his side of the story  Como 4 caught up with Williams as he was ejected from a South Lake Union hotel around 7 p.m.  On Sunday, Williams was arrested after an altercation at a nearby restaurant  Police say he argued with customers and threatened the manager with a pool cue  Williams is accused of then throwing a lit cigarette into a family's car 
[02:09:30]  Which hit a woman in the face  Throwing a rock at that car  And struggling with police officers  A group of fans claims Williams assaulted them after his performance Friday night  Tonight Williams admitted to us he has had trouble with the law here in Seattle this weekend  He made a string of allegations against police and the media  Then he told us because of his bad weekend in Seattle  He's decided to end his stand-up career  I'm just going to go ahead and announce my retirement from stand-up  I'm kind of done 
[02:10:00]  This is  You're not really  Yeah  I've already discussed it with my kids  I wasn't really going to do it on the Seattle street  I was going to go to Los Angeles and do it in the offices of ICM or Live Nation  Holy shit  But he just does it on the street  What's going on with him?  That's like the third time he's retired by the way  Oh really?  Is it?  Yeah, he's retired before  Did he pull this shit?  Yeah  Yeah, he's just  I just don't think he handled fame very well, man  What's his problem?  He's one of those guys though, man  I've never 
[02:10:30]  I don't know the guy  I think he's fucking funny  I've never heard a good story about him  Oh  I've never heard one good story about him  You know what I mean?  He's one of those people where you're just like  I think he's just fucking crazy  I think he's probably an egomaniac and he's fucking crazy  And then you throw those two things together in combination with fame  And you're fucking  You're done, man  Right  You're done  Volatile formula  Yeah  That's what you call a perfect storm  I love the string of events he got himself into  And the newsman has to stay all newsy and shit still  Hit her in the face 
[02:11:00]  I like that one  Let's dig right into the car  Hit her in the face  And then he assaulted fans after his Friday show  And then blah, blah, blah  I like how the guy goes  Punched an old lady on the elevator  And then he went on to  Hold up a 7-Eleven  Cat's here to admit that he's had a string of altercations with the law  What's he going to admit?  We know he did  There's nothing to admit to  We heard the story that he threw a rock at these people's cars  That's so funny, man  What the fuck do you think?  I want to know what 
[02:11:30]  What made him snap?  Yeah, I want to know  It might be being on the road  Sounds like the road is just a horrendous place to be for you guys  But what made him threaten customers?  I don't know why the road is a horrendous place for you guys  That sounds exciting  It's got to be fucking a grind after a while though  But if you're single going to a different city every weekend  What's so bad about that?  It's  I mean, it depends on how you're  You know what?  Here's my thing  It's a little different now  Than it was for me 
[02:12:00]  A few years ago  You know, it's still not where  You know, a lot of guys  I'm obviously not at like that Louis level, whatever  But like  I'm in a decent place with it now  But it's like  I realized a couple years ago  What makes the road hard  And it's like  I was on an airplane  Going to like Florida or something  And I was like  So angry  And I was like  Fuck  And then I was sitting there  I was like  Why am I angry?  Like I'm getting paid to go do shows  And then I was like  Oh, because  I'm not going to my audience right now 
[02:12:30]  I'm going to a audience  And then I gotta fucking deal with like  The drunks  And if they don't like me  And all the bullshit  That's what sucks about it  And until you really sell lots of tickets  You have to put up with that  You know, to a certain extent  In some places at least  So it just gets tough  It gets lonely  And the vices are there  The vices are there in your ears, man  You know, it's like  It's hard to go back to that hotel  And just sit there  You know, people go  Well, you go back and you're right 
[02:13:00]  You know what I mean?  Like  That's not like enticing  Like you can do it  And it's healthy to do  But  But why do you have to just go out drinking?  What the fuck else are you going to do?  It's a  You know, you don't get done until midnight  Check out the city  See what else it has to offer, no?  At one in the morning?  What else are you into besides drinking?  What else can you do at one in the morning  Besides eat shit food?  You know what I mean?  I'm just asking  I'm not saying it's wrong  No, no, no  I'm not being defensive  I'm saying  But what else could you do?  What other things does Joe DeRosa like  When he's not doing stand-up  And not drinking? 
[02:13:30]  I don't know  You drugs  I don't know  No, but I'm saying  Like Bill Burr  He has to check out  Like a lot of sporting events  And he sets his schedule in such a way  Where he's checking out some great  Yeah, come on, Joe  Bill can go back  Jesus, Joe  Bill has the advantage  Of being able to go back to the room  And read about the National Trust  Three hours  Yeah  Figure out where his money's being filtered 
[02:14:00]  These fucking banks, Joe  You know what I'm thinking?  You know what I'm thinking?  I'm in a hotel, right?  Okay?  Fucking laying there  You know what I think I'm going to do?  I'm going to take all my money out of the bank  And I think I'm going to  I think I'm just going to have it sewn inside my pants  I'm just going to walk around my money on me all the time  And I figure, fuck it  They're going to take it  Just kill me  Fuck it  It does a little of that  I love it  It does a little of that  Guys, I'd love to hang out  What the fuck?  Where are you going? 
[02:14:30]  Well, I'm going to film a part in Amy Schumer's TV show  Very nice  Amy's got her TV show  And yeah, I got it  Are you allowed to say what you're playing?  Or is it top secret?  I don't know  So I'm just going to keep my mouth shut  Okay  But suffice to say  You know, it's not a fucking Shakespearean role I'm doing  Let's be honest here  Is that Othello?  No, no  It's not going to be Othello  It's not going to be a dramatic role 
[02:15:00]  I don't think I'm going to get an Emmy for Best Dramatic Role  Hey, you never know, man  You never know  Don't downplay it  Well, have fun  You break a leg out there, kid  Oh, thank you, sir  I'll have fun  And I'll tell Ms. Schumer  We all say hi  All right, take it easy  Have fun  Have a good week  All right  See you, buddy  I'll call you, Anthony  Good to see you, pal  All right, Sam  So long  Yeah  Hey, big fat E-Rock  Hey 
[02:15:30]  Can we turn down the lights so we can get into it, Joe?  I love it  Get comfortable, Joe  Get comfortable  We're going to turn off the TV lights  No TV today  I'm sorry  I love it  I love it  Let's get into it  But here's the thing with the road  Can I go back to what you were asking?  Yeah  Oh, thank God  Yeah, turn off the lights  Here's the thing, Ope  Daytime is one thing  Nighttime is the problem  Why night time?  Because you're saying, can't you go  Like you said, Bill goes to sporting events, right?  Well, obviously you should go and get your pussy and all that  But, well  But I'm just saying 
[02:16:00]  But that gets dangerous  All right  Fair enough  So, why can't you just walk around the city or the town  And just check shit out?  That's what I would do  That's why I'm jealous of you guys  But you could do that during the day  What do you  I'm saying at night  Aren't you just tired from after doing all the shows?  Dude, you're wired  You get a little food  You're fucking wired  I have a beer or two  I get all that  Yeah, but you  I mean, here's the thing  Here's  All right  If you have  Now you're married  Having a wife to go home and call  Right 
[02:16:30]  From the room  And you say hi to the kid  Or whatever it is  You know  That you do  Ah, the lights are going down  I love it  It's never been like this in here before  We're gonna get fucking talked today  I was thinking today  Like on the way in  That I've never had a  Like a conversation with Joe DeRosa  So that's what we're doing today  Here we go  We're gonna be different today  How intimate do we want this?  Are the curtains shut  So it's just you and Joe?  Nah  The other side of my point is this 
[02:17:00]  If you're a stand-up comic on the road  And you are married  That's way worse  Oh, I disagree  Why?  Well, look  The grass is always greener  I guess  Because I think if you're single  The road is a perfect place to be  Excuse me  You can fucking  You find your pussy  Hopefully not the crazy kind  Do a little partying  You could  Check out the city  You don't have anyone to check in with 
[02:17:30]  I got great advice  How bad could that be?  I got great advice once  From a comedian  Yeah  Who's been around for a while  I was on the road  I was opening for this guy  Like seven years ago  And I was like chasing chicks all weekend  And he kept being like  Dude  You gotta stop  And I was like  What are you talking about, man?  How old were you?  I was in my 20s  Yeah, so  At the time  What's wrong with this faggot?  Well, he wasn't  I kind of was like 
[02:18:00]  What's the problem?  I don't understand  But I'll tell you  Getting that advice  When you're in your 20s  But I'll tell you why  Because he goes  He goes  Dude  He goes  I know you're thinking  That I'm being like  Like a stick in the mud  Or whatever  He goes  I'm not  He goes  I'm telling you something  I've been down this road  He goes  Here's what's gonna happen to you  You're gonna come back  You're gonna start headlining these clubs  And all these girls  That you're fucking  In these cities  Are gonna start coming back  To your shows  And acting like  They're your girlfriends  And he goes  And you're gonna have  A fucking problem  On your hands soon 
[02:18:30]  And I was like  Get out of here  And sure enough  A couple years later  It happened a couple times  And I was like  Holy shit  That's what he was talking about  These girls start turning up again  But how can they possibly think  You're having an actual relationship with them  If you live in New York  And they live in  I don't know  Name city here  Look  Some girls  Some girls get what it is  And it's just  You know  A good girl going  Hey let's just go have some fun  You gotta question  The fucking mentality  Of a certain kind of woman  That's gonna just go 
[02:19:00]  And bed down with you  In your fucking hotel room  I mean you know  A lot of them aren't stable  I'm not saying they're all like that  Some of them are just chicks  That get what it is  So then they assume  Way too much  And then next time  You're in the city  Or the town  They think  They're your girlfriend  Yeah well  I don't know  I don't know if they think  They're your girlfriend  But yeah  There's like  They keep  An entitlement  You leave a city  And they keep texting you  And like  I've hooked up with girls  On the road before  Where I've had to tell them  Like two months later  Like look  I'm sorry 
[02:19:30]  Like I don't know  What you think is happening here  But like  I live in New York  You live like  Well you should have  Told them that  Two minutes later  Yeah but you know  You just  I know  I know what you're saying  But you just kind of assume  Like everybody understands  Everyone's on the same page  Did you ever see that  Did you ever hear that  Patton Oswalt bit  Where he talks about  When the fair comes to town  No  And he's like  And then you  How long is the bit  It's long  Because it's like  A whole like  Comparison to the president  And everything  He talks about  When people believe  That when people would believe 
[02:20:00]  That Bush loved them  When he said he loved  You know  And he goes  That's like the equivalent  Of like when the state fair comes  Okay  And the guy that did  Rock on is there  And you suck his dick  Behind the ferris wheel  Then he leaves  And you're like  He said he loves me  And he's like  Sure he does sweetheart  Yeah he'll be back  Right  It's kind of like  It's kind of like that  Like some girls think like  But I don't think  You're giving the women  Enough credit  I think they know  What's going on too  Some of them do  I'm not  I'm not generalizing  All the women  I'm just saying  They might have to  Play it differently  But I think they know  There are potential problems 
[02:20:30]  Dude  And then you get  You get a few chicks  You get a few chicks  In a row  That are in your hotel room  That start acting crazy  Right  You get a couple  Fucking criers  Had that happen  Right  Where a chick starts crying  And you're like  What's wrong  And she's like  I'm not  I'm just drunk  And I'm just  Get sad  And you know  And it's weird  And you're like  Listen  I don't know  What is going on  In your life right now  But it's freaking me out  Yeah  So like  You know  It's just  You get into weird situations  And you're just like  Eh you know  This isn't that good anymore  Alright so what else 
[02:21:00]  Would you like to do  On the road  Look  During the day  Is great  But what do you do  During the day  I go to a lot of  Record stores  Because  Funny enough  It's easier to find  A fucking record store  In another city  Besides New York  Obviously it's so easy  To get music nowadays  But I miss the days  If you're in a different town  Or a different city  To go to those  Local record stores  Were just so much fun  For me as well  It's a blast  Trying to find the bootlegs  And all that shit  That maybe some comedy records  You never heard of before  Or whatever  I go look for bootlegs 
[02:21:30]  I'm a big movie guy  So I go  I buy DVDs and Blu-rays  And so I go collect that stuff  I'll go to like  You know  Cool clothing shops  Cool bookstores  I'll find like  I'll ask like  Hey what's the best  Sandwich shop in town  Like what's your signature  Sandwich out here  Wherever  And I'll go get that  I go to the movies  What kind of sandwiches  Have you had  Nothing crazy  Are you making  I can't tell  If you're making fun of me  I'm enjoying the conversation 
[02:22:00]  But I can't let that one go  Why is that weird  What kind of sandwich  Why is that weird  What's weird about that  Their signature sandwich  Yeah like you go to some cities  And they'll be like  They'll be like  Yo dude you gotta have  A fucking woogie  And you're like  What's that  You know  They'll be like  It's a sandwich with  But it's the excitement  It's like  If I'm in Philly  If I'm in Philly  Yeah I want a cheesesteak  Of course  But  Yeah  But you search out  The signature sandwich  Dude you're sad man

[02:23:00]  I forgot that I was even playing  That's so funny  So what was the sandwich  That you remember  And what town was it in  My favorite food  Was never one of the  Signature sandwiches  No  But Pittsburgh  They have sandwiches  That they put french fries  And coleslaw on  I forget what they're called  Fuck  That sounds good  I was upstate  At the comedy club  Where Brother Weez 
[02:23:30]  The club where Brother Weez is  Yeah of course  It's called the comedy club  So you might have done  A beef on a wick  Up there  Yeah  And they have like  The garbage plate  Like that's their big thing  Up there  I love the garbage plate  What else man  Did you try the garbage plate  I almost got one  But I hate macaroni salad  So much that I didn't get it  Why you hate macaroni salad  Disgusting dude  What's wrong with macaroni salad  It's fucking noodles and mayonnaise  It's disgusting  I love macaroni salad  It makes me sick man  Potato salad's my favorite  Potato salad's the bomb  German potato salad 
[02:24:00]  If done right  Ew  Is that the vinegar one  Of course Iraq says ew  Yeah it's oil and vinegar  Yeah that one stinks  You like mayonnaise  We all know it  No that one stinks  The mayonnaise one's the one  Nah I like a good  German potato salad  Ew  Yeah  Yeah my mom used to  Make that shit  I don't like it  I like the mayonnaise one  But anyway  The uh  Uh there's a killer  Italian shop in San Fran  That I go to when I'm there  I can't remember the name of it  Yeah  But I always go to that place  There's uh 
[02:24:30]  What else is there man  You know  You go down to like  Florida  The coastal cities  You go get seafood  You know just shit like that man  I don't know  You know  Sounds boring  It is  It's boring  Don't you like to just find like uh  It's gonna sound a little  A little lame  But like a  A good coffee shop  And just people watch  It's my favorite pastime  To just hang out  Hang around  And watch how people interact  No  Not at all  Even on like maybe a crazy street  I like to walk 
[02:25:00]  And maybe meet some people  And like just kind of  Cruise around the city  But I've never been big on like  Just sitting in one place  You like cruising around the city  I like cruising  Looking for cock  Yeah I don't  I never like just sitting in one place  I'm antsy  You know I was just standing up  Two seconds ago  You get the fucking lights  Turned down  It's a different vibe right now  I know  But I'm saying  I still have to stand up  Like I'm an antsy guy  It's hard for me to sit in one place  For a long time  People are saying  The music beds are annoying  No they're just not getting the vibe

My grandmother 
[02:26:00]  Were you close to her?  Yeah I'd say so  You know  What kind of lady was she?  She was  The kind of lady that just  You know  Just lit up a room  Who's mom?  My dad's mom  Dad's mom?  Yeah so  That's kind of the last of his  That's it for him?  That's the last of his blood  Really?  I mean I guess he's probably got  A few aunts and uncles left  But yeah that's  His immediate family 
[02:26:30]  That's the last one  What was your first thought  When she passed?  A memory?  Something that  I was  To be honest with you  It was more about my dad  Just worried about him?  Yeah  I was like fuck  That's gotta be right  His brother died two years ago  His father died two years before that  And when his mom  When his mom  We knew it was coming  When his mom died  I was like oh man  This is  That's gotta be really hard  Yeah  You know now that I'm getting older  I'm starting to have  It's kind of why  I want to get married  Cause I'm  I mean I want to get married 
[02:27:00]  Just cause I want to get married  But like I'm having like those  Well it's legal then  It is  Thank you  You know it's about time man  You want to get married?  Yeah because I'm starting to have those realizations  Like I'm 35  I'm like something could happen  And my parents  You know they're 65  What do you mean something could happen?  I just realized recently  That if my parents die  That's it  Like I have no  I have no siblings  Wait so  Your family structure  Is just you 
[02:27:30]  And your mom and dad  At this point?  Yeah I mean I have  Ains and uncles  That we hang out with and stuff  I'm not  Yeah but the older you get  You kind of don't hang out  With them as much  Yeah we see them on the holidays  Well yeah of course  Like everyone else  You know when I go home  At Christmas  Or Thanksgiving  Like home base  Is my mom and dad's house  And I'm like Jesus  When they die  That's  You know  All my cousins are getting married  And having kids  I'm not married  You know  So it's like I'm pretty  You know  It's going to get to a point  Where I'm calling you  On Christmas  And going 
[02:28:00]  Oh can I come on over?  You come over this year  You know  I always wanted to be married  I just was  Fuck  With the wrong people  That's what I've been doing  But don't fucking just do it  I'm not going to do it hastily  A lot of people do  No I wouldn't do it hastily  A lot of people start getting nervous  About their age  And their mortality  And all that shit  And then they just  We call it settling  A lot of people just settle  No I'm not going to do it  I actually  And then you're in a living hell  A few years into it 
[02:28:30]  I got to be honest  Your marriage is very inspiring  To me in many ways  Why?  I'm not just saying that  The age that you did it at  The healthiness of the relationship  As far as I can see  It seems like a very like  Healthy relationship  The fact that you're  I say this respectfully  The fact that your wife  Is hot and cool  You know what I mean?  Like so there's a lot of stuff  About the way you did it  Where I'm like  Wow that guy did it exactly  Like the way I'd like to do it  Right  He waited until he was 
[02:29:00]  A little older  But I wasn't waiting  But I  I would have been married  If I found the right person  Believe it or not  I would have been married  In my twenties  Right  I never waited  I didn't have a  I didn't have a timeline  Right  I was actually giving up  On the fact that  I would actually find someone  When it happened  That's the weird part  Well that's usually  When it happens I think  I think so  I think cause maybe you're  Maybe it shows  Maybe you sweat differently  And the women just know  That you come across desperate  Or wanting or something 
[02:29:30]  No you get  When I fucking let it  Just fucking let it go  And just like  Kinda  Like I said  Kinda gave up  Like alright  I'll just be that stupid  Single guy  Fuck it  And then it happened  Yeah  That's when it happens  That's when you get  Delayed the most  That's when everything happens  When you don't give a fuck  When you just chill out  Not take things seriously  You know  It's like  When you don't give a shit  It's like trying to  I always thought it was like  Trying to get over the border  I just gotta interrupt  For a second  This guy writes  John in New Orleans 
[02:30:00]  Dead grandmothers  In a sexual feeling bed  Yup  That's a different vibe  Alright  That's hilarious  That's hilarious  So you were adopted  To Joe  Yeah  How does that make you feel  Oh  You wanna really crack the can  On those fucking issues  Well yeah  Why not  I got  All kinds of shit  I got  I got people that are  Adopted in my circle  And my brother is actually  Thinking of adopting  In the very near future  Your brother  Yeah 
[02:30:30]  Look it's a beautiful thing  It's nice that you can  Sort of rescue a kid  I guess is the  How old were you  Nine days  So they got you fresh  They got me fresh  Out the vet  Fresh  Fresh out the box  Freshly baked  Yeah  I mean  Still cooking  There's a lot that  Goes along with it though  There's a lot of  Subconscious stuff  That comes up  When did you realize  You were adopted  I always knew  I don't remember  Them telling me  I can't remember  When they told me  Do they look  Very different than you  No  No 
[02:31:00]  People always go  It's weird  You're adopted  You kinda look like  Your parents  It's not like  A weird match  It's kinda like  The dog thing  The dogs start  To look like  Their owners  Dogs look like  Yeah  I think that's  What happens  With adopted kids  Yeah I think so  Why do married  People look alike  I don't know  That's a little strange  That does start  Happening  It's fucking weird  Every married couple  I know  They look alike  Yeah  And it's not like  Oh when they first  Started dating  It's like  You notice it  After like five years  You're like  Holy shit 
[02:31:30]  You guys look alike  If something happens  You change  I don't know  Fucking weird  So I mean  Obviously  Your parents loved you  You're adopted  And you just always knew it  Which is strange  Right  So you didn't have the big  Oh we gotta tell you something  Sit you down around eight years  Nah there was none of that  Did they ever  Did they ever officially tell you  Even though you knew  What do you mean  Well they did sit you down  And go  They must have  At some point  But you have no memory of that  I think  I think what they did  Was just from the time  I was a baby 
[02:32:00]  I think they just would say  Like  You're adopted  Which means  You know what I mean  I think they just kind of  Worked it into conversation  Or something  I don't remember them  Ever sitting me down  And telling me  Wow  That seems a little weird  Literally no memory of it  I remember being about  Twelve  And I finally  Started doing the math  And went  Wait a minute  Terry  My older sister  Wait a minute  She's  She's like  My  Steps  Like she has different  Parents or something  I remember thinking  And they finally told me 
[02:32:30]  Yeah  She was from my  Dad's first marriage  You didn't know  Your dad had a first marriage  Oh no  Probably  Not so much  At twelve  Probably no  But I'm like  Wait a minute  We're all the  Like my mom  My mom had  Six kids  Five births  Six kids  The last two  Were twins  But my sister  Is six years older  Than all of us  And the rest of us  Are all in a group  We're all one year apart  So then I started  Thinking wait a minute  Why is she so much older  And finally had the  Realization when I  Started doing the math 
[02:33:00]  Like wait  You guys were married  In such and such year  And wait a minute  How is she older  Than you know  Your marriage  And all that crap  Is that weird  When  Is that a weird thing  Like your dad  Having a previous marriage  I always wondered  What that was like  Um  It's really strange  Because  My dad's story  Is this  He married his  High school sweetheart  They were completely  In love  And she died  Of like  He didn't really  Talk about her much  So you know  I don't have  A lot of info  But  She died of like 
[02:33:30]  Some kind of kidney disease  At like 25  26  That's the only reason  I'm here  Only reason I'm here  He didn't want to  Lose his first wife  That's sad man  He ended up  Loving us  Like  You know  Loved the shit  Out of us  But  To get to that place  He had to lose  The  The woman that  You know  He deeply loved  That's really sad  Met my mom  I don't know  Like  Four years later  Maybe something like that  A couple years later  I'm not really sure 
[02:34:00]  And  Yeah  And then  Had  You know  Like a 40 year  40 year marriage  With her  Was he still alive?  No  He died in a car accident  He did?  See this is why  We're talking Joe  We walk around  Like we're friends  We don't know shit  About each other  I didn't know that  He died in a car accident  Right  Literally  Literally  A week after  We had the big press conference  To announce  We were coming to satellite radio  After he stuck it out with me  For two and a half years 
[02:34:30]  Off air  Oh my god  Yeah  But he was on his last leg  He had heart problems  Oh that's terrible  We knew it was coming  But we didn't expect  A car accident  To take him out  What was the accident?  Can you talk about it  Or is it too much?  Yeah we've talked about it on the show  Right in front of the house  I grew up in  So I don't really like  Driving by my old house anymore  What happened?  Taking a left out of the driveway  Busy road  And T-Bone  He wasn't driving  Another couple was driving  My mom and my dad  To just  Just a local little  Yacht club in the area 
[02:35:00]  To have a little lunch  That's it  Got up  Took his little shower  Brushed his teeth  Said let's go  We're going to have  A nice little lunch today  And next thing you know  That's it  He actually walked himself  To the ambulance  Gave all his info  But he was on blood thinner  So his brain with the blood  Just  There's nowhere to go  So it keeps expanding  And that's pretty much  What did him in  Oh shit  So it wasn't like  He was completely with it  After the accident  He walked to the ambulance 
[02:35:30]  He said  Yeah this is my name  Here's my insurance card  Here's this  Here's that  Is my wife okay?  Oh my god  She was bleeding  On the side of the road  He takes out his  You know his handkerchief  He's you know  He's an older guy  He had the hanky  Sure  And was making sure  My mom was okay  She was bleeding  And went off in the ambulance  And next thing you know  He you know  Shut down  He went into a coma  Oh my god  But he pretty much  Was with it  All the way to the hospital  That's horrible  Horrendous  Sorry to hear that man 
[02:36:00]  That was like  Eight years ago  Jesus Christ  Yeah  But he saw my brother  The weekend before he died  And my brother  Actually said to his wife  At the time  I don't know  I just said at the time  To marry  But I guess at the time  This happened  This is the last time  I'm going to see  You know my dad  He just knew  He said that?  He was breathing heavy  And stuff  Just trying on pants  I mean his heart  Was in a bad place  Yeah  So maybe it's a blessing  I don't fucking know  Because he was going to 
[02:36:30]  He was heading toward  Tough times  It wasn't going to get  Better for him  His health  So maybe in a weird way  That it was supposed  To happen that way  I don't know  But right in front of my house  You know usually  We lost pets  Right in front of our house  Not parents  And your mom left the house  After that happened?  Yeah yeah  We're out of there  Fuck that  Where does she live now?  In the home  Sister living  Alright  She took the brunt of the accident  It's amazing  She survived  He was actually  He was actually  Behind the passenger seat 
[02:37:00]  In the back  You know what I mean?  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah  I hear you  So the car hit  Where my mom was sitting  Jesus Christ  She got fucked up  But like was fine after  Or did she have  Physical problems after that?  No everything fine  Broke ribs  And all sorts of shit  But she  No she  She  Has no real  You can't tell  She was ever in the accident  Jesus Christ  Yeah  So  That's so sad  Sorry to hear that  Not really  Not really?  It has to happen 
[02:37:30]  The whole story's sad  No it is sad  I'm  I'm alright with it  Well I mean  I'm sure you heal over time  But you know  It's sad  My dad was an amazing guy  An amazing guy  Just full of love  Never yelled  Never raised his voice  Nothing  Never hit us  Or nothing  Just was just full of  Fucking love  Cared about like  Human beings in general  That's how my  Always cared about people  To the point  It was a detriment  Because he brought in  A lot of people to our house  That's how my dad is 
[02:38:00]  He's real gentle  And like  Very soft spoken  But like would  Fucking break his back for you  Right  And not ask a question about it  If I called my dad  And said  Dad I'm coming home Friday  I need you to build  A brick  A red brick fire pit  In the backyard  By the time I get there  Don't ask me any questions  I just need you to do this for me  Right  He'd fucking do it  Really  He'd be like  Okay  Alright  What do you need  Yeah  He wouldn't  He wouldn't  There would not be  One part of him like  Why 
[02:38:30]  He would just do it  He'd never ask questions  He just knew you needed this thing  No he'd just trust you  That if  You know  I would never take advantage of that  But it's like  He trusts  He's like  It's my family  And they need it  I love them  I'll do whatever I can  That's what was  So was your mom  The same way  Or much different  No my mom's very giving as well  Yeah  Okay  But my mom's much  My mom's the alpha personality  In the relationship  So me and my mom argue a lot  Same here  Yeah  She's super alpha 
[02:39:00]  Like she'll be like  Shut up  Right  You know  It's like hanging out with Keith Robinson  Sometimes  The problem with my mom  You can never confront her  She was  My entire life  She was never wrong  Not once  Not  Yeah  My mom's kind of like that  One time  My mom's kind of like that  She admits she was wrong  About anything  And you know  Some shit went down  But  So you're adopted Joe  Why is that a problem  It's not a problem  It's just that there's a lot 
[02:39:30]  That comes along with it  Like what  You got parents that love you  As their biological own  Yeah  Look  There's a lot  There are a lot worse situations  I could be in obviously  But like  What's your issues with it  There's an ambiguity  When you have a question mark  About your  Origin  It's weird  Like after a while  It starts to kind of  Fuck with you  You're like  Wait a minute  Where do I come from  And what is my medical history 
[02:40:00]  And all these things  And it just raises  A lot of questions  And you really can't find out  A lot of that stuff  I could go find my parents  Have you tried?  Not yet  I think I might one day  I don't know if I'm going to do it or not  I think about it a lot  Now  You don't do that  Because you feel guilt  With your  Your parents  I didn't do it for years  Because I didn't care  I honestly didn't give a shit  But if you feel like  Alright  If I start searching out  My biological parents  My parents are going to be  Kind of bummed out  I don't  Look  My parents would support me 
[02:40:30]  110% if I had to do it  I know they would  You know  There'd be a little part of me  That felt bad  About their insecurities  That might come along with it  Right  But that  If I really was going to do it  That wouldn't stop me  And they wouldn't let that  Stop me either  They would support me  So what's holding you back?  Sounds like everyone's  Dude it's terrifying  Is what's holding me back  Because it's like  It's  You know  I just don't know  If I'm ready  To try to do that  We've talked about it  On the regular show  You know  You might be missing out  On being the son of a billionaire  Or something  Yeah  Or you know 
[02:41:00]  Look  I could  What's terrifying about it?  Not being accepted by them?  Who knows  I can't even  I can't even begin  To put into like  Actual thoughts  What scares me about it  I don't  Really?  It's so overwhelming  It's such an overwhelming thing  The process  The loftiness  Of the  Excursion itself  Of doing it  Like what you would have to go through  To get it done  And what  The anxiety  That would build  Through that process  As you got closer to it 
[02:41:30]  Yeah  You know  Getting that call  Finally  Where the guy's like  I found him  Wow  And then you gotta be like  Alright  Do you wanna contact them  And see if  They wanna  You know  And then you gotta deal with that  Which was probably like  Waiting for like  Fucking HIV results  Sit there for two weeks  You know  And then like  I mean  It's like  When I  I sit and think about like  Okay if I got through all that  The moment of 
[02:42:00]  Driving up to their house  Or  Or going to meet them  At a coffee shop  Whatever it is  Yeah  And just that like  Moment of like  When I walk through that door  Nothing is ever gonna be the same  In my life ever again  But it sounds like  You gotta do it  I don't know  And you're like  You're a filmmaker man  Maybe that's something  You take on  A little documentary action  I have  Yeah  You know what  I actually  You don't have to put them on camera  But just the  The journey itself  Cause  Cause I'm sure 
[02:42:30]  There's a shitload of people  That can relate to  What you're saying right now  I wanna do a documentary  About my  My adoptive family  Actually  Why  That's what I really wanna do  We had a lot of loss  In the last couple years  We lost a lot of people  In the family  And it's amazing to me  Where are they  They died  Oh  Come on man  What  Come on  We're having fucking  Intimate time right now  You can't go for those jokes  I just said  Where are they  You can't  Can't do that  During fucking  Dim light time  You're right 
[02:43:00]  It is dim light time  You're right  I'm sorry Joe  I owe you an apology  You're right  See it's always right there  I can be serious though  I'm doing it now  Let's go  I believe you  What kind of tragedy  Expected deaths or  Well my grandfather died  That's kind of expected  Then my uncle died  Unexpected  Yeah  How old  Well my  The first uncle  Was my mom's brother  He was 62  I think  He had a massive stroke 
[02:43:30]  And died  Ugh  Then my other uncle died  My dad's brother  Then my aunt  Eneka died  Like two months after  My uncle died  And then  And then my grand  My grandma just died  Oh my cousin died  In the midst of all that too  So it was like  There was a lot of death  In the last few years  In the family  Don't you find it weird  That  Like all of a sudden  You'll have a lot of death  In your family  And then you'll go 
[02:44:00]  Years and years  And then it happens again  It's strange how that  Works out sometimes  We got it all at once  Man  That's what I'm saying  Yeah  It was just like  Like a landslide  This has been rough  I lost my grandma  Who was everything to us  Because we only had one  That we acknowledged  My mom's mom  We never acknowledged  As a grandma  Because she was a  She was a royal fucking cunt  If you want to be honest  Here Joe  Hey we can be honest  We hated her  We hated her  Right  Evil  And then  So my dad's grandma 
[02:44:30]  Was everything to us  She picked up the slack  Big time  Like my father  Just full of love  And didn't give a fuck  About herself  Always trying to  Take care of others  So  We lose her  Then my  My dad's brother  My uncle  My uncle Frank  We lost unexpectedly  He was only in his 50's  Dropped out of a heart attack  Snowblowing  His driveway  That was horrendous  It was the saddest  I ever saw my dad  We had just a dumb  Little pizza joint  In between all the shit  You gotta do  And he's just  Balling 
[02:45:00]  Unshaven  Like unshaven  My dad always  Kept a clean shave  Just looked like shit  And was so sad  It was brutal  It was horrendous  It was the saddest  I ever saw him  And his thought was  That you know  He should have went first  You know  He didn't want to be around  For you know  To see his siblings die  It's fucking brutal man  It's a  I'll tell you this  And then I lost my dad  So my point being  You know  It seems to happen  All at once sometimes  Yeah 
[02:45:30]  It's a big  It's just a big landslide  The reason I want to do  A thing  Like a movie  About my family  Is that  When my grandfather  My grandfather  Was like  A man of  Zero words  And  No affection  What so ever  Like  To you?  To any man  To any man  You couldn't hug him  So he was old school  You couldn't hug him  What do you do for a living?  Remember I tried to hug him once  And he was like  No no no  You hug the women  You do not hug the men 
[02:46:00]  Oh he's old school  How old was he?  How old was he when he died?  Yeah  Fucking 88  89  How long has he been gone?  Five years  Yeah he's an old school guy  What did he do for a living?  He worked for the railroad  Of course  Those guys didn't hug anyone?  No he was  When my dad went to Vietnam  He shook his hand  And he goes  Come back alive  That was it  That's all  That's all your dad got  That was all he got  But your dad's not like that  No my dad's  Super affectionate  I hug and kiss my dad  Every time I see him 
[02:46:30]  So why didn't he talk?  Was he just depressed?  No no no  He just was like  He was an old school guy  He talked to you  Like if you talked to him  He would talk to you  But those old school guys  Talk  They just talk very differently  Than we do  They talk in those  In silly jokes  Yeah he made a lot  Dude he made a lot of those jokes  Of course  He made a lot of those jokes  He'd say things like  He'd say things like  You got a  He'd go like  I got a  What the fuck would he say  If he had 
[02:47:00]  About like his gut  He'd be like  He'd be like  I got a  I got a dresser body  He'd be like  What's that mean?  He'd be like  My drawers come out  Further than my chest  You know  He'd say shit like that  Like those fucking dumb old  And he thought he was killing  Yeah  And he would always laugh  At his own joke  We're losing that art form  By the way  You hang out with the older generations  And they still can tell a good joke  But they try to make believe  It's part of the conversation  But it's obviously  A set up 
[02:47:30]  Old school joke  Yeah  He just  Yeah  I used to go to the  VA hall with my dad  And they'd all sit around  With those set up jokes  And it was kind of cool  To check out  Yeah they slip them right in  It's just like  It's just part of the way  They talk  Yeah I went to church  The other day  Like oh  But no he didn't go to church  It's setting up his dumb  You know  Fucking priest  Touching a kid joke  Yeah yeah  Exactly  Exactly  The uh  Yeah Kenny did one of those  On me down the hall  Kenny  Yeah  Kenny has it in him  He's like  I got relatives 
[02:48:00]  That died in Auschwitz  They fell out of a guard tower  You know  Yeah  You know  It's like those things  But like he uh  But he was that  Never complained  Ever  If you fucking complained  About anything in front of him  He would be like  He'd be like  Oh boy  Oh it's so tough  You know he was that guy  He fought in World War II  Never cried  Right  Never dude  Never showed emotion  So my uncle and my dad  Is that good you think  I mean it built really  Really showing emotion  I'll tell you  I built really strong men  Out of my uncle and my dad 
[02:48:30]  Right  My uncle and my dad  Were very affectionate guys  But they were really strong guys  Like you could lean on those fuckers  All day  They never  They're the same way  They never complained  Right  Ever  You could lean on them all day  If they got money  It's your money  You know what I mean  It's like  Like they were  They really giving guys  Really giving guys  And  But what I learned  When my grandfather died  Was how little I knew  About the men in my family  That's what I thought  Was so interesting  I learned so much 
[02:49:00]  About my grandfather  After he died  Like what  Iraq  Turn the music down  A little bit  Jesus  A little bit  Like all these war medals  That he received  And all these honors  He received in the military  I had no idea  Because he would never  Tell you about it  Yeah he would never  Brag about it  He would never tell you  He wouldn't even show you  He wouldn't even be like  Hey look at these medals  Isn't that neat  To like teach you about  He wouldn't fucking tell you dude  Wow  His whole thing was like  How you doing  Alright you good  Great good to see you  You getting big kid  You hungry  Alright 
[02:49:30]  Wow  Don't complain  Shut the fuck up  Right  Go watch these videos  That was the end of it  You know  Wow  So when he died  I learned a lot about him  After his death  And then my uncle died  And it's like  I'm getting to an interesting place  With my dad  Where we're super close  But I'm realizing like  There's so much  I don't know about my dad  And I think that'd be  A really interesting  Exploratory like movie to do  To like sit down  And be like  And really go through  The lineage of the family  Why don't the men  Talk about  Their achievements 
[02:50:00]  Or who they are  What they've been  Why am I so different  From you guys  Right  You know  And all that sort of stuff  And like  It's just interesting to me  Dude I  My dad's 65 years old  I'm 35  I have no  I couldn't tell you  What he did  When I was growing up  As a job  I know the company  He worked at  My dad was like that  Yeah and I know  Like the job title  But I couldn't tell you  What the fuck he did  He won't tell me  Like I try to talk to him  About it  It's like  I don't know what it is  Like  Was it illegal shit  No  He was like an engineer  At Unisys 
[02:50:30]  Which used to be  Spary Univec  Which is the first company  That invented the computer  He worked at the company  That invented the first computer  And I go  What did you do  And he'll be like  I was an engineer  What does that mean  He probably  He probably invented the computer  But didn't have the patent  And that drives him nuts  Yeah  They just downplay everything  I talked to him  He was in Vietnam  I'm always like  What was that like  Was he in the shit  You know  He was over there  Was he in the shit  He was over in fucking Vietnam  I mean 
[02:51:00]  How far out of the shit  Can you be if you're over there  You know what I mean  Right  You know  It's like  You can only be so far  Removed from it  And he fucking still  Every  But he wakes up  He wakes up at 3am  Every night  Why  Because of Vietnam  To this day  Because that was his guard duty time  When he had to make his guard rounds  Right  He had to get up at 3 and 1  Every fucking night  When I'm at his house  Because I'm still awake at 3am  I'll be down  And he's watching TV  He wakes up  And it scares the shit out of me  Because you're sitting watching TV  He still gets up at 3am  Because of what happened in Vietnam  Gets up every night at 3am 
[02:51:30]  And comes down  Gets something to drink  And just kind of stumbles around for a minute  And then goes back to bed  Now  Fucking crazy  What are you doing in Vietnam  Not crazy  But you know what I mean  But what are you doing  He hasn't told you any stories  Like when I  When I go up to Rochester  And I hang out with Brother Weez  We'll wind it up  And he'll fucking tell me  Holy fuck  Yeah  Holy fuck  He was in it  Yeah  He was in the shit  But he also admits  Because  He says  You don't hear this much  About the guys from Vietnam  He said he had a fucking blast  He went 
[02:52:00]  He went back on his own  He was having a good time  Yeah  But he was also in the shit  Like he  He did some things  He did some things  I'm not gonna  I'll let him blow up his own spot  But he also said that  You know  It was better than going back home  So he  He went back on his own  I think he ended up  I think he ended up doing  Three tours  In Vietnam  When most people are like  Fuck get me the hell out of here  I think my dad only did one tour  He was there right at the end  But he always  Here's the thing  He always just says  He always just says  That he worked in the mailroom  That's all he ever says 
[02:52:30]  Right  He worked in the mailroom  He won't  Maybe he just did  I don't know  But my mom told me  That when he got back  From the war  They went to her parents house  For dinner  And a helicopter flew over  And my dad dove into the bushes  Really?  Because of the  You know what I mean?  And it's  It's like  That's not  Come on  It's like  That's fucking  Like  She said like  Knee jerk  Fucking reaction  Like ran and jumped  Into the bushes 
[02:53:00]  Because a helicopter went over  But in general  He has a normal life right?  Yeah he's fine  You wouldn't talk to him  He comes up every once in a while  Wow  Wow  He's super super quiet man  He's just  Like  Did he see death over there?  He won't  He's never told me  Why don't you ask him?  He told me that  He gives me like  Like  He gives me like  Broad  Things  And they make me think  Like there's gotta be more  To that than that  He told me about  When he went to the post office  To send my mom 
[02:53:30]  These earrings  Or something  Ears?  Earrings  Yeah ears  Yeah  He was carrying  Nears attached  To the earrings  Yeah he was going to the post office  To send my mom  That might have happened  Every once in a while  Over there  Right  To send  Some jewelry  Or some shit  That he bought her  And he said  The fucking post office  Was blown up  It just wasn't there  And he went  It's like  There's no way  You didn't see  Fucking bodies  Lying around  Of course he did  But he  But like  He never goes into that  He just kind of laughs  Like  Isn't that funny  The post office was gone  Right 
[02:54:00]  It's like  I think there's a lot more  To it than that  But he  Like  He just  I don't know  He doesn't talk about it  He never complains  Ever  Ever  Like it's crazy  It's not  I don't mean crazy  Bad crazy  I'm just saying  It's like  So weird to me  That's why I hate  These entitled fucks  I remember people  Where they didn't complain  Remember that  Ever  They just did their  Fucking job  And lived their life  Who's  Who's entitled around here  Let's get into it 
[02:54:30]  Oh you have  A million times  But  No it's about you today Joe  I want to know  About you too  I told you  A good story  My dad lost  A son  I should have another  Older brother  How old were you  Before you were born  No it was the first marriage  What did he lose him to  The famous  Crib death  Jesus Christ  That's why I  Stay out of that shit  When it comes up on a show  I'm not going to be the one to say  You know  Not to do shit 
[02:55:00]  But  Brutal dude  That's so brutal man  Supposedly it was like  But you know what  I don't know if  For some reason  I think it might have  Been two  Kids  At the same time  Or something weird  It's a little like  It's a little like  Not shady  But  I'm not sure  Definitely one  Maybe two  Driving down the wrong side  Of the fucking road  Trying to get to the hospital  And got pulled over  By a cop  Cops saw what the fuck  Was going on  He was driving  And holding a kid  At the same time 
[02:55:30]  And  Yeah  The cop was like  Holy shit  But there was  Nothing  They could do  And he never talked  About this shit  He lost  He lost his  Fucking high school  Sweetheart  And a kid  At least one  Like I said  I think it might be two  But I'm not sure  I gotta check with my brothers  It's funny  I was talking about  This with  You know  Giannis Papas  His comic  No of them  Really funny dude  And a fucking solid dude  Like solid  Old school 
[02:56:00]  Like let's have a beer  And talk shit  Like he's a great guy  Right  And  We were talking about this  Like the difference between  Like the generation  That our dads came from  And the generation now  And it's like  It's like the whole thing  But everything is so  Me me me now  The whole thing then  Was you  It was like  You did what you did  For your family  Right  And I was like  We were talking  Like oh Giannis  I didn't realize  Until I was in like  My late 20s  That we were kind of poor  When I was growing up  Like  We were like teetering 
[02:56:30]  Like we were like  Right on there  On like lower middle class  Like we did not have  I remember for like  Dude I'm not exaggerating  Like six  Seven fucking years  My parents  They had ripped up  The carpet  In the hallway  Of our house  And it was just  The plywood floor  Or whatever  Dude  It was a plywood floor  For like seven years  Because they couldn't  Afford to put down  Like the linoleum  Or whatever they wanted  To do on top of it  Right  It was just unfinished  Like when you're a kid 
[02:57:00]  That shit doesn't register  Because my dad  Would never let me  See him say  Fuck  What are we gonna do  We're broke  Like he wouldn't  Let me see that  Well now you're gonna  Get me you know  Pissed off  But  Pissed off why  No good  Cause  Cause it was  It was different  In my house  My mom made it  Made us all  Very aware  That we didn't  Have money  And the stress  On me as a little kid  Was something  To this day  You know  I still struggle with 
[02:57:30]  Really  Yeah my brother  Will tell a story  He goes  I remember you being  12 years old  And I was a caddy  My friends had paper routes  I was a caddy  I was making  So much more money  Than them  Yeah  So much more money  That's the fucking  I wish you could go back  And do that  Like I made in one day  What they were making  In a week  And I was working  Pretty much seven days a week  And my brother remembers  You know  That I had to come home  With my money  And give it to my mom  She would  She would write it down 
[02:58:00]  Like we'll give it back  To you eventually  I mean  They gave me  Some of it back  Way  When it didn't matter anymore  Right  And he  And my brother  Talks about how  I remember like them  Sitting you down  Talking about their  Money issues with you  And I remember  Being a little kid  Going why the fuck  Are they telling him  Jesus Christ  You should be  You should be  Sheltering that shit  From your kids  Why have a 12 year old  So I was fully aware  Of the value of a dollar  And the fact  We didn't have it  Wow 
[02:58:30]  And I felt that stress  I remember as a kid  Like that's something  It should have never  Crossed my fucking mind  Wow  She was always man  Like always like  I don't know  How are we going  To pay our bills  And how are we going  To eat  And always like  Very vocal about it  In front of all of us  Well I remember my mom  Being a little more  Outspoken about it  The stress of it  Than my dad was  Because my mom  Worked too  You know  She worked full time  I was a latchkey kid  I remember her being 
[02:59:00]  A little more vocal  About it  But at the same time  I do remember  Like my dad  Just never letting on  That we  That we were broke  Like it was like  But I remember  Christmases where my mom  Came to me and said  Listen you're probably  Not going to get  Anything this year  No  Yeah  How old  I don't know  13  12  13  14  Like that  That age range  No  15  That's when Christmas  Matters the most  It was maybe  It was probably  You know  It was probably  More like 14  15  Like when she was 
[02:59:30]  Like kind of like  Listen  Enough already  You're old enough  That you can deal  With the fact  That you might not  Get shit this year  14  15  I mean they always  Got me something  It wasn't like  You know  That's not  That's too young still  I can see if you're  18  19 maybe  I was  I remember being  Young enough  That I was like  What the fuck  Come on  And it was just  Because they didn't  Have money  Yeah they weren't  Being an asshole  Yeah they weren't  Where was all  Their money going  If both of them  Were working  And you were in 
[03:00:00]  A lower middle class  Situation to begin with  My  They just were never  They were never  Alright we noticed  That when you asked  I know what they're doing  I hear it in the background  Alright you idiots  Go ahead  They just  They just were  They just weren't  Good with money man  They were typical  They were typical  They were typical  Baby boomer couple man 
[03:00:30]  They fell into  The fucking trap  They fell into  That credit card  That new  That new homeowner  Generation  You know like  Move out to the suburbs  And get the house  And fuck it  We'll put it on the  Banks tab  And they had the  Credit cards  And they just  Fell into the trap man  They just were  Always behind  They were always behind  That's us  You know  That was us  You know  And they just  My dad was more  Than capable of  Making the money  But I think  He gave up on a lot  Of his career  Aspirations 
[03:01:00]  Because my mom  Just got more  And more fucking crazy  Really  I think part of it  Was he decided  To not work anymore  To kind of keep  Tabs on her  Really  I think so  Wow  So then he always  Had some kind of  You know  Scheme going on  To bring money  Into the house  He was a bright man  And a smart man  And every once in a while  He would hit pay dirt  And I don't know  If I've ever talked  About this on the show  But all of a sudden  We did have money  It was nice  And then it would go away  And then we'd have to wait  For the next 
[03:01:30]  You know  Fucking thing to come in  Yeah that's weird  I kind of remember  That happening with us too  Like there were certain years  Where it was like  We're going on vacation  And all this stuff is great  And then the next year  It'd be like  All dried up  We got nothing  I wonder what that's about  I never understood  I think they just  Would get ahead  And then like  Fall back into the  Credit card trap  Or something  Right  You know  But  I remember my mom  Saying to me  If I mouthed off  Or if I was an asshole  Because I was a real  Mouthy kid 
[03:02:00]  I was an asshole  She would say  She would go  You son of a bitch  We're still paying  For that shit  We gave you in December  Like she would say that to me  Like you  Because I was being  Like an ingrate  Right  And I never knew  What she meant  And then I got older  And I understood  What she was saying was  We put all your stupid  Fucking Christmas presents  On a credit card  And you're being an asshole  Yeah and you're being an asshole  Like we're paying it off  $30 a month  Right  You know  Because we bought you  $400 worth of shit  So how about you  Appreciate some of this  Yeah 
[03:02:30]  You know it's nice though  Now finally  It's not the job of a kid  To make sure the parents  Know they're appreciated  I don't think  No but I was an asshole  Yeah  I know that I was  Very disrespectful  I'm not saying I was  Look  I'm not  I'm not  Martyring my parents  And saying they never  Provoked it in the wrong way  I think you know  It's always a two way street  But I know that I was  A fucking asshole  I was  I was an only child  I was selfish  Right  You know you have  A very weird dynamic  With your parents  When you're an only child

Someone is writing me  Saying that I gotta  Explain to you  That my mom  Is mentally ill  But you know that right?  You've alluded to it 
[03:04:30]  But you never really  Got into it  Never really got into it  Well I mean with me  Personally  Oh no  She has OCD  Really bad  But there's probably  Other issues in there  That I'm not really  Interested in finding out about  How bad is it  Like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5  Like that kind of OCD?  Thoughts  Thoughts  What do you mean?  Well  Let's say  You know  That guy got assassinated  In New York City  On 58th Street  Yeah 
[03:05:00]  And obviously  They don't have to kill her  There was a time  She would read that shit  And think she did it  Holy shit  Exactly  And my dad  I'm amazed  And I don't know  How he fucking dealt with it  And he would go  Alright  If that's what you really think  Because she would obsess  About it  And convince herself  She had something to do with it  So my dad would simply go  Well then go to the fucking  Police station  And turn yourself in  And then she  Could rationalize  Like okay yeah  Obviously this is stupid  Wow 
[03:05:30]  But the problem is  That we didn't like  We didn't get a diagnosis  For all this shit  Until I was  I was in Buffalo  Doing radio  I was like  I'm trying to think  About 25 I guess  That's when I  They finally said  This is what your mom has  And it was a huge relief  To finally  You know  Get an understanding  Why shit was  How it was  When I was growing up  That's tough  Oh that's why  She did all this  Now I get it  That's tough man  It's too bad 
[03:06:00]  We didn't find out earlier  I think  I think we would have  All been better off  Yeah you probably could have  Taken some measures  To try to help fix it  Hell yeah  I mean but back then too  Mental illness is not like  It is today either  You kind of swept that shit  Under the fucking carpet  Or put them in a home  Or something you know  And that's the thing  As we talk about  The past generations  If a guy had problems  It was like  I'm gonna keep my mouth shut  Because I'm a man  And men don't complain  If a woman had problems  It was like  Ah you're being a fucking bat  Would you just shut up  Yeah 
[03:06:30]  You know what I mean  We didn't define anything  Yeah there was no  Now we over define everything  But like yeah  There was  I don't know how it skipped  I guess there was probably  A perfect mix  Or a perfect balance  In the 70s  Maybe in the 80s  I don't fucking know  But certainly we don't have it now  It's in the way  In the other direction  So you were poor  And your mom tells you  You're not gonna have  Christmas presents  Every once in a while  That's fucked up  Sometimes  That's kind of evil  I mean they would still  Get me something  But it would be like  Real fucking  It sounds like  Lackluster  And I know  It just sounds like  There was a bitterness there 
[03:07:00]  With me?  With your mom  In a weird way  What do you mean?  I don't know  Like to say that to a kid  Well I mean  She wasn't saying it  I still consider a 13  14 year old a kid  She wasn't saying it like  Hey just deal buddy  She was saying it like  But that's really sad  Let me brace you  What's more  What's sad  Her telling me  Or coming down  On Christmas day  And there's not  You don't have anything  Right  At least she fucking  Gave me a heads up  Right  I mean like I said  They always got me  Something but they'd be like  They'd be like  They'd spend like  They're probably years 
[03:07:30]  Where they spent like  100 bucks  You know one  You have one kid  You spent 100  But you're pretty fucking  Broke at that point  You know you're talking  About the 90s  For Christ's sakes  And then all your friends  Have  Wasn't that long ago  A much bigger Christmas  Around you probably  Yeah dude  And I remember too  Like this was a big one  When we all got bikes  Right  In the 80s  Everybody got  You know  Everybody was getting  Their bikes  Freestyle bikes  Were real big  It was with BMX  And all  And like  Thrasher magazine  All skateboards  And bikes 
[03:08:00]  Were the thing  And you were either  A bike guy  Or a skateboard guy  And I would  Me and my friends  Were bike guys  And GT  Was the fucking bike  Man  GT was the shit  And  Skateboards  It was Powel  Peralta  Or Vision  That was it  You know  And I wanted  A bike  And a skateboard  And I remember  I got a Kmart  Rambo skateboard  Because my parents  Couldn't afford  The real deal  And I got  For a bike 
[03:08:30]  I got a Schwinn  That was the best  They could do  And all my friends  Had GTs  All my friends  And they were just like  They were trying  To explain it to me  Like they weren't  Being shitty about it  They were just  Trying to say  Like we can't  We just can't  We can't drop  Six bills  On a bike  Right  We can't do it  And of course  I was a kid  I didn't understand  I just got mad  And had a fucking  Temper tantrum  Or whatever  And then I got a Schwinn  And then  How fucked up  Is this  I got a Schwinn  And I was like  Oh I got a good bike 
[03:09:00]  This bike's the shit  And then you take  Your bike around  To your fucking friends  And they're like  That bike stinks  Of course  And they tell you  You don't have  You know  You take your  Rambo skateboard out  You're like  Isn't this thing great  And your friends are like  No that's like  A toy skateboard  Right  I got a fucking  I got the fucking  Skull and bones  Vision  Kids can be evil too  Real evil man  I'm already learning that  My kids are nothing  Then there was  Two and a half  In what two months  They can be real evil  Holy fuck  Passive aggressive 
[03:09:30]  Assholes  Yeah  Then remote control cars  That was like  The next phase  After bikes  Same thing  Like all my friends  Had like  The hobby shop  You know  The shit  Like hobby shop  You build it  From fucking scratch  Like the real deal  Remote control cars  And I had like  The  One that came  In like  The plastic box  From fucking  Toys R Us  Or whatever  But they were trying  They were trying  Like I'm not  Knocking them at all  I feel bad 
[03:10:00]  Like if they would  Think that I'm  Shitting  I'm not shitting  On them  It's just like  That's the  That's what's  You know  That's your reality  You just kind of  Realize oh shit  We don't have  Like the thing  The other kid has  As much as others  You know  You know  We grew up  With all no frill shit  We grew up  Where my mom  Would get us  Like one pair  Of sneakers  For the whole year  And as a kid  Growing up  That's  If you think about  It's crazy  Yeah  The holes  I mean  I remember  When it was time  To get a new pair  Of sneakers  Holy fuck  We got  We got the use 
[03:10:30]  Out of the old ones  Yeah  We got one haircut  A year  Which I think  Some of that stuff  Like it's kind of  There's more to that  I think  My mom was so obsessed  With the fact  We didn't have money  But I don't know  What the reality  Of that really was  In the end  I have no idea  Because our house  Was pretty big  Out there on Long Island  You know  Yeah we had a big house too  And we would get  One fucking haircut  A year  Like I would go  From a crew  They would  They would give us  Crew cuts  End of the school year  Literally the next day  Crew cuts 
[03:11:00]  For the summer  And then the next time  We would get a haircut  Would be the end  Of the school year  The following year  So I would go  From having a crew cut  To hair out of my shoulders  Holy shit  Year after year  No shit  And I think that  Now that I look back  On that  I find that really  Odd and strange  Yeah man  How much of the haircuts  Back then  Five bucks  Right  It's yeah  Because we weren't  Getting any  Anything fancy  Yeah you weren't  Getting shampooed  And everything  No man  It was just a quick  Buzz cut 
[03:11:30]  That could have been  More than three or four bucks  Couldn't buy the clippers  Back then either  But I think that was  The level of what  Her money issues were  And what she believed  She believed  She used to yell  And scream all the time  We're going to be  You know  Homeless out on the street  Always  Jesus  That's rough  Always  You can't blame her  Because she had  Mental things  Oh really  Well seriously though  Somebody that's not  Completely stable  It's like  It's not their fault  Well I guess  And I talk to a lot of people  That have mental illness  In their family  You just wish 
[03:12:00]  There was some  Sort of responsibility  Some sort of  Self awareness  It's tough  I never got that  Never  No aware  No awareness  That  What her issues  Did to our family  It's tough man  It's tough  And it's tough too  I like how we're  Making everyone  Uncomfortable around here  I don't give a fuck  I'm having a great time  I don't give a fuck  I just like the  Tony Braxton  Is playing  Oh I know  I hear the music  That's really tough  Because that's got to be  That had to be  Heartbreaking for your dad  Like to deal with  The dynamic of 
[03:12:30]  Having kids and a wife  That was going through that  The heartbreak for my dad  Which I've never  Talked about on the air  Is simple  He completely  Believed in my mom  Completely  And believed that  Someday she would be better  And every once in a while  He would like  Kind of like  You know  Take me aside  And go  I think we're making progress  I think this is it  She found a new doctor  She's on a new medication  I think this is it  I think finally  You know  She's going to be alright  Jesus Christ 
[03:13:00]  Right to the end  Man  He believed in her  Is she still like that?  Like what?  Like this  Like what you're talking about  I mean she's older now  So she can't  She can't do a lot of  Her evil shit and stuff  She had a poison pen  So what's that mean?  She would write  Letters and stuff  They call that a poison pen?  She would have loved Twitter  She would have loved Twitter  No like 
[03:13:30]  My brother  Dating  15  16 years old  Discovering  Pussy  Discovering  Girls  Had a girlfriend  They did a few things  And my mom  Found  Her underwear  This girl's underwear  Right  So my mom  Thought right away  That this  This girl had to be a whore  She's 15  16 
[03:14:00]  Discovering her sexuality  So decided  It was very logical  To mail the panties  To her parents  Holy shit  Thank you  And thought  Nothing of it  Like that was  No that is  A normal thing to do  But that's how people  Thought back then  Her parents need to know  What she's doing  That's crazy  It wasn't even like  Because I know  I know the girl  In question  All that too  I mean  No  She was just  A regular  Fucking girl  Growing up  That's not even  Like evil shit  And that doesn't even 
[03:14:30]  Mean that my brother  Had sex  I don't even know  What they actually did  But that's like  That wasn't even  Evil shit back then  That was just like  That was like  Literally your mom  Being like  They need a wake up call  Their daughter's up to no good  Nah  Do you know what I'm saying  So you think that's alright  I don't think it's alright  I just think it's the way  People who functioned  That's mortifying for a teenager  It's like you'd fucking  The godfather  When they mail the guy  The fish  Right  And they're like  This is the message  We drowned him  Right  This is you  We send messages like that 
[03:15:00]  Like that's like  Old school shit  But that was more  Just normal growing up shit  There was nothing  Evil there  It didn't deserve  The response he got  Yeah I mean look  I was  You want to talk about  Fucking  Backward sexual  Whatever  I mean  I went to Catholic school  For 12 years  You know  They made me  I had borderline panic attacks  The first three years  That I had sex with girls  Like  Afterwards  Why?  Because of  Because of all the bullshit  That they hammer into your head 
[03:15:30]  You're gonna go to fucking hell  You're gonna get AIDS  You know  They hammer all this terrible shit  Into your head  But you seem too young for that  That was like  The people  Like  Like my  My parents generation  Fuck no dude  Crazy Catholic school  They still did that to us  When I was in Catholic school  Wow really  Dude when I was in 8th grade  I thought that was long gone  By the time we were  Growing up in  I didn't go to Catholic school  But our  You know  Our friends  And whatever  Went to Catholic school  When I was in 8th grade dude 
[03:16:00]  They were still  You're talking  1990  1991  Whatever it was  I was in 8th grade  And they were putting that fear  In your head  The priest came into the room  Classroom  And gave us a lecture  About sexuality  And told  And they really built it up  Like  Father's gonna come in  And give you guys a talk  Cause you're at that age  You think you're gonna get a guy  Coming in going like  Guys look  Here's where you're getting  Fucking boners  You know  Like  Are you gonna break it down for you  He fucking sat up there  And told us  That kissing  And holding hands  Could be a sin  I mean it's like 
[03:16:30]  Insanity  And then you find out  What these assholes  Were up to  Yeah right  A lot of them  Yeah  A lot of them  Yeah this guy wasn't  But yeah  No I'm not saying he was  I know what you're saying  But he  But those guys knew  That shit was going on  Yeah but I mean  They had to have known  That shit was going on  Whether they were doing it or not  Yeah  It was just crazy  It was crazy  I remember  A priest telling us  In high school  Like what a sin  Sex was  Pregnant girls  Just to get kicked out of my high school  Wow 
[03:17:00]  Catholic high school  Because that's what Jesus would do  Yeah of course  Yeah fucking poor girl  She's like 14 years old  She gets pregnant  She's terrified  This fucking asshole  Fucking asshole nun  That ran my high school  Would throw these girls  Out in the street  Yeah that was  That's what God  Would have done  Yeah it's disgusting  It's disgusting  So you know  But did your parents  Pay for Catholic school?

[03:18:00]  And I'm so glad  I didn't go down that road  It's  It's stunk  It's stunk man  It's  I mean  In certain areas  The education was actually  Pretty good  But  But you really miss out  On a lot  Just like the  The  You miss out  On the full spectrum  Of high school  You never got to do shop  Or any of that stuff  You know  Like that was  You know  I always  Was mad that I never  Got to do shop  Or  The science program  Obviously  In a Catholic school  Isn't really  Fucking up to speed  Right  You know  Like stuff like that

[03:20:30]  Some literature class  Or something  Where'd you go to college?  I went to Temple  For a year  Then I went to  Kutztown University  In Pennsylvania  Your parents had money Joe  Those are state schools  And I  No it was all my dime  I'm paying the loans now  Oh okay  Yeah they took loans out  Yeah alright  Which they never explained to me  Just every  Every August  They'd go  We gotta go to the bank  And I'd sign something  I was fucking high  Out of my mind  I didn't know what I was doing  Right  And then at the end of it  They're like  By the way yo  Fucking 
[03:21:00]  Yeah no shit  $45,000  I was pissed off  Because I  You know  My parents were really  Strict as far as  Our school work  And all that  And getting good grades  So I worked my ass off  I was like  I was the perfect kid  When it came to school  And all that shit  Then I'm in high school  And I start  You know  Everyone's starting to talk  About college and stuff  And I did  I did everything  You know  Right  All those years  Right  And then they sat me down  And basically said  Yeah we don't really have money  For your college  I'm like  Well fuck  So you never went 
[03:21:30]  I ended up going to Geneseo  What's that  State school  SUNY school  Okay  But at the time  I had a great communications program  Because I knew I wanted to do  Something like this  So it all worked out  It did work out  I had a guidance counselor  And I told them my dreams  But I'm like  Look my parents don't have the money  Because at the time  It was like  You went to Syracuse  You went to Boston University  You went to  It might have been Temple even  Was that the one back then  Temple had a good  Communications program 
[03:22:00]  Right  So did Kutztown  And I was  And I was depressed  And then he went through his files  And he showed him  He gave me a pamphlet  For Geneseo  And said look  No one knows about this place  But it really is  A good communications  Program  You could get on the air  As a freshman  Which these other places  You couldn't  And I didn't know that  At the time  I thought I'd just  March into Syracuse  And Boston University  And those were powerhouses  For broadcasters  And I would be on the air  Immediately  And they're like  No that's not true  You'd be lucky to be on there 
[03:22:30]  As a junior  But this place  This little school  In upstate New York  You could be on the radio  You know  First day as a freshman  Right  It did all work out  In the end  Yeah  But thank God  But I just assumed  If I'm doing all the  Hard work and stuff  That my parents had  A big plan for me  Yeah no  Meaning you know  Getting me into a  You know  A good college and all that  Yeah it's  It's funny how it all  Kind of works out  Like that  You know  I think  You know  I went  I went to Kutztown  I was going to drop out  To pursue music 
[03:23:00]  With the band I was playing in  And  Is this Ashford and Simpson  Who is this  Scott  Is this Barber  Scott  Scott  Scott  Yeah  I was going to drop out  To pursue music  With the band I was in  They were like  They were like  Talking to me  Like you got to like  Stop going to school  And we were going to  Move to Philly together  Like  Yeah sure  And I felt so guilty  That my parents 
[03:23:30]  Were going to be so  Disappointed  That I didn't leave  School  I was right about to do it  And at the last second  I was like  I'm not doing it  I can't do it  The band got really mad  I ended up quitting the band  It was like  Really traumatic  As you look back  Are you happy  You made that decision  Well at the time  I soon after  Regretted it  I resented my parents  And I was like  I felt guilty  And I did this  But now I look back  And I'm like  Thank God  I would not be a comic  Right now  Because if I follow  The string of events  That I'm not going to  Take you through  It's too long  And boring 
[03:24:00]  But that lit a few  Me staying in school  Lit a fuse  To a chain of events  That led me  Directly to doing stand up  Wow  And I don't mean  That just like  Well who knows  What if you did this  Maybe then that would  I mean like  I can trace  The steps  Sure  Of why exactly  Music led me  To stand up  In the way  That it did  And it wouldn't  Have done that  Had I left school  For it  Damn that's going  To be part two  You know so  Yeah  This is like  This is great  This is like

[03:27:00]  A four part series  Of conversations  Well we certainly got  A second part  I was hoping to talk about  Your stand up career  And how you got into comedy  And all that  But we'll do it  We'll do it next time  Oh yeah  I'd love to do that  There was some good background there  I'd love to do that  Because I'm always fascinated  Why you guys  You know  Ended up in comedy  And it's always because  You're like  We're brought up  Like fucked up  We're different  Than the average  Fucking norm  Whatever that is  I don't even know  What that is anymore  But 
[03:27:30]  It all leads to  It's just so funny to me  How  How  The dysfunction  That leads you to it  Like you know  We were just talking about  Right  How  I had such a resentment  For my parents  For  For me feeling guilty  That I stayed in school  I was so angry about that  For so long  And it's like  But that  Staying in school  Led me to comedy  And then also  That same resentment  And anger  Helped me comedically 
[03:28:00]  Because that was  My  That was part of my  Fucked upness  Gotcha  Do you know what I'm saying  That you bring on stage  And you're working through  You know  It's just weird  How it all  Now the guys from your old band  Did they ever do anything  With music  Yeah  They moved on to other projects  Or whatever  They all did other stuff  Yeah  But any of them  Kind of make it in that  Arena  One of them  One of them  Became a chef  In New Orleans  He's still down there  And we're actually  Going to play a  Music show in April  When I go to New Orleans  And he still plays  A lot of music  He was 
[03:28:30]  He's been in some  Like fairly prominent bands  Like on  The indie scene  Or whatever I guess  Any bands we know  I don't think you'd know them  No  But you know  Guys that were  Respectable  You know  It's like comedy  It's like you can work  With notable people  And get out there  And be doing your thing  But at the same time  Still not be that known  You know  Right  And then  The main guy in the band  Started a small label  And he puts out  A lot of other bands  Albums  Now he put out  My band's album  A few years ago  Right  So like we're still  All in really good terms  And like we're all 
[03:29:00]  Still friendly  And we talk once in a while  But it's you know  Not like it was  You see these guys  Every fucking week  Sure  You know  These are the kind of guys  That I would have  Bought presents for  At Christmas  Have you gotten  A present for everybody  On your list  Have you picked it out  Oh my god  I got one dumb thing  So far  I hate shopping  For Christmas  I hear the stress  In your voice  But me and my  Me and my wife 
[03:29:30]  Are almost to the stage  Where we might not get it  Each other or anything  Because  Because it's  When you have kids  It's not because of the money  Right  No it's all about the kids  Though  Like I have no problem  Shopping for my  My son  And my young daughter  But like  Just buying shit  To buy it  Like  We all  And we all do it  And no one wants to be  No one wants to be honest  About it  You walk around the mall  And you're just  You're just annoyed  And you're like  You start just  Fucking buying shit  You know  They're never gonna use 
[03:30:00]  My mom keeps asking me  What I want  I got my parents something  I got them a killer gift  They're gonna shit  Their fucking pants  What is it  I almost  I don't wanna say on the radio  Cause I'm scared  It's gonna get ruined somehow  Can you write it down  People I know  People I know  People in my family  Listen to the show  So I don't want it  To get the roof blown off of it  They're gonna freak out  What year is this  What  What do you mean  What do you mean  What year is it

[03:37:30]  Oh  Oh  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Yeah  Series XM  Hey hey hey  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  That was an odd hour.  Maybe a little more than an hour.  Much longer.  How long was that break?  That was... 
[03:38:00]  It's about an hour and a half.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  We changed the mood in here a little bit.  Sometimes that needs to happen.  You know your shock jocks.  You know how they roll.  You know the show as it sounds on a day-to-day basis.  Sometimes, we need to dim the lights a little bit.  We need to be a little more intimate with our approach to radio.  Iraq, you were a big help.  You were instrumental in setting the mood today. 
[03:38:30]  DJ Nagle.  I had to leave at points.  Like, I was sitting in there.  But, like, when Opie is talking about the death of his father  and Brian McKnight or whoever it was comes on,  I gotta go.  I can't be in here anymore.  It just seems disrespectful at that point.  But, I mean, I don't know.  Opie may have a future in that.  If that's the new format of the show.  I mean, that was compelling.  Now, imagine if Opie just talked to somebody who was interesting. 
[03:39:00]  Then, we'd really have something.  Oh, yeah.  I'm only kidding.  Right?  Are you?  Anthony.  Am I?  What?  Anthony in New York.  How do you feel, though?  Anthony.  Sam Roberts.  Usually I tell you good morning and call you the king of the after show.  That's right.  But today I am pissed off.  I hate to hear that, Anthony.  I have a message for the shit dicks down the hall.  Oh, I don't call him that.  Fix the fucking app.  Day number two, the app stuck.  It logs in. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  It stopped at checking channel art.  Fix the shit or I'm dropping the service.  What's the, uh, what type, where do you listen?  What type of phone do you have or whatever?  I have the iPhone.  And it's not working on your iPhone?  It is day number two, Sam.  It just sticks.  It just sticks.  Have you, uh, have you restarted?  Sam, I am not calling customer service again.  I've been on the phone with them three times today and installed the app 20 times.  I told them to kiss my ass.  I'm done.  Oh, no. 
[03:40:00]  What's up, Troy?  I can help this guy out.  What's up?  Because I use the app?  You do?  Yeah, and this happens to me all the time.  Okay.  All you have to do is just keep on it for another 15 minutes.  Uh-huh.  Because like it says, downloading channel art, uh, this only happened one time.  Yeah.  Just completely ignore that.  That's, that's a lie.  Do you mean where it says, when it's, when it's, it says it's a one-time download.  That's a lie, you're saying.  It happens every time.  They're lying to you.  Let me see if it does it right now.  Every time the, every time the app crashes, it reinstalls it, uh, re-updates itself, it 
[03:40:30]  checks channel art.  Oh, this, this went on right away.  Um, hey, Troy.  But, but it happened.  Have three seconds.  What's up?  You have a meeting because of it, probably.  Oh.  No.  Um.  He does.  Good morning, Masha.  You listening to Hits, one?  Well, I go to the gym in the morning before I come in.  Oh, you listen to me?  Yeah.  Nice.  So your app's working.  I don't like the song, though.  No, that's showing up. 
[03:41:00]  I hate that song, actually.  JTX?  Yeah, it's awful.  JTX sucks.  Has it, wasn't JTX the one that was on the after show?  Didn't he show, wasn't that the dude that showed up here in Kiss Paint?  Yeah, he's terrible.  I think that's J. Thomas' son.  Oh, whoops.  Well, he sucks.  I mean, J. Thomas.  His songs are terrible.  He's not good at this stuff.  I think that must be why Hits, one, plays the shit out of him, though.  You know what I am feeling, though, on Hits, one?  What?  Sam, Sam and the Womp.  That's a great song.  That song's great.  I hate that song.  I love that song.  Yeah, it's his long-lost song.  I think he put it on for adoption or something, and then he found out later that JTX, then 
[03:41:30]  he found out later that J. Thomas was his dad, something like that.  So what's your advice for Anthony?  Just let it go.  It'll eventually do it again.  It'll eventually load.  It just takes, like, 15 or 20 minutes.  Oh, so, like, turn the phone on, and then just put the phone down, and then come back.  Like, set the, like, go to the app, and then just walk away.  Have breakfast.  Yeah.  Maybe work out a little bit.  No, do this before you work out, because then that way you can listen to the app.  That's what I do.  Oh, but you have to, so you'll, like, wake up, turn the app on, let it warm up.  Yeah, just let it walk away from it. 
[03:42:00]  Just pretend it doesn't even exist for a while.  Do your thing for, like, 15 minutes.  That's how you get the instantaneous results.  Well.  Yeah, well, I guess by the time ONA's contract's over, the app will start working again.  Yeah, maybe that's what'll happen.  Two years in, it'll finally load up.  Thank you, Ian.  But I understand this guy's frustration, because I'll go to the gym, I'll be ready to work out,  I'll get ready to put the, go to the app.  Then I won't bring my iPod, I'll just bring my iPhone.  So it's not just this channel.  It's just the app.  It's the app.  Yeah. 
[03:42:30]  So how come it takes 15 minutes?  Isn't the internet, like, the future of all this?  I think so.  And we have, we seem to be pretty well set up.  We have the apps, we have a service to offer.  But when the app is working?  It's great.  It is really cool.  And the on-demand shit is awesome.  On-demand's awesome.  Yep.  But you're saying the app can sometimes take, and it's, what time do you work out?  Five o'clock in the morning?  Yeah.  There shouldn't be that much traffic on the app that you have to wait 15 minutes.  But then I'll close it out, and then I'll go back to work out later on. 
[03:43:00]  I'll try to put the app back on.  And then it does it again.  I'm like, I just did this.  It's three times.  I don't know what's going on.  You gotta get our shit together.  You react more angrily, though.  No.  You know.  It gets frustrating, because you want something, and you want it at your fingertips, and then  it's, there's a delay.  The company's gotta get their shit together in terms of the internet.  The internet, I mean, if we can get our, if we can get the internet going well for  us, we're gold.  Yeah.  If we can't, we're in a lot of trouble.  Yeah.  You mean, I don't mean, you're saying the internet runs slow in your office? 
[03:43:30]  Yeah.  I don't mean that the building has to be networked for the internet.  I mean, the app itself.  It's for the consumers, not to make sure that the people who work here have speedy internet  connections.  Oh.  I don't know if it's related there.  I don't know.  That sounds like you're more, you're more, it's a different bandwidth.  It's not.  Well, that's why I don't work there.  Like, the people who are listening to us, we're not sharing, are not sharing bandwidth  with us using computers in the office for looking up pictures of Bruce Springsteen.  Son of a bitch. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah, well.  Bruce Springsteen's bulge.  What'd you think of that?  What'd you think of that, Roland?  That there's a new phenomenon, that Bruce's bulge is this new thing.  He's the boss.  Let it hang.  Have you noticed it before?  No.  I don't know.  Yes, yes.  Everybody's noticed that.  I mean, I know, first thing.  I'm not even a Bruce Springsteen fan, like, all that big of a fan.  Yeah.  And, like, I noticed that he's got, like, a massive bulge.  I know.  12-12-12.  I was watching that concert.  The first thing I noticed was, like, holy shit, look at that bulge.  Yeah.  He may have a full erection in his pants.  That's what I said to myself. 
[03:44:30]  And he knows it, too.  That's why he wears such tight pants.  Of course.  You know that on each show, Bruce has to decide, all right, which leg am I going to sling  it over tonight?  Which direction am I going to point it in?  Yeah.  Because it stays put, because he wears those tight pants.  When Jim interviewed Peter Criss for The Boneyard, he was talking about how he used to  come out to sing Beth from the drums, and he would, like, kind of give his dick a couple  tugs to kind of plump it up a little bit.  Because they wore the spandex.  Yeah.  So that way, people would walk out, and people would be like, oh, you know, wow, Peter Criss  has got a huge dick.  Right.  So, you know, Bruce does that same, everybody does that same shit. 
[03:45:00]  What do you think of the theory that Bruce uses?  And I think, I don't remember if it was Opie or Anthony that said it, I think it's a great  theory that Bruce uses Viagra before going out there, just to get his blood pumping.  I probably don't think so.  Why not?  It's like Garth Brooks when he wears his sort of tight pants.  No, I've never heard the attention Garth Brooks crotch gets being anywhere near what Bruce  Springsteen's dick gets.  I get more excited.  It's like, oh, what song he'll play next?  Now it's going, oh, look, there's this.  I mean, it's big, Roland. 
[03:45:30]  It's really pronounced.  You can't deny that.  He has a very pronounced bulge in the face of his pants.  Massive.  Massive.  Is it bigger than Nagel's?  Well, Nagel is a mainly ball bag.  You could tell that when he, when he was stripping and he stripped down to his boxer briefs, he  had a bulge, but you could tell there's a lot of testicle meat in those pants.  I don't think there's a lot of shaft?  No, I didn't look like it.  Eric, am I wrong?  Yes, it shows.  No, no, no.  Am I wrong?  Is it, is it, is the bulge that I saw, is that what I think it is? 
[03:46:00]  Is that mainly testicle meat or shaft?  I have big balls, yes.  It's mainly testicle meat.  I thought so.  I have big balls.  In fact, he's got the biggest balls of them all.  Bigger than Jonathan's?  Now, Roland, Bruce, on the other hand, that's obviously shaft.  I mean, he's got a piece.  That's not balls.  You saw it, Troy.  Yeah.  You've seen a lot of dicks in your time.  Well, I mean, you know.  You've seen a few.  A couple here and there.  Okay, so you'd know.  Is that ball bag or is that shaft?  That's all shaft.  You could tell.  You could tell the hose. 
[03:46:30]  You could tell.  You could see, in those pictures that were posted on that thing, you could see the hose.  You could see the head.  I mean, you could see the outline of his penis.  I didn't see those pictures.  You've got to look them up, Roland.  Did you watch 12-12-12?  Yeah.  Did you have a blindfold on?  No.  I thought you had high-definition television.  I do.  Then that ball should have been boom.  I didn't notice it.  If you had 3D, you'd likely get cock-slapped.  You better watch out for that, Roland.  Keep those glasses off, because you're going to get abused.  I did. 
[03:47:00]  Kanye West came on.  When you got cock-slapped?  Sometimes, I don't know if you think out all your sentences.  I don't.  No, no.  Not always.  Dave?  Dave?  Yeah.  What's up, buddy?  I'm here.  Hey.  All right.  I mean, you know.  Talk.  Yeah, you could talk if you're here.  All right.  Hey.  Hey.  What?  I had the problem with his app.  I had that happen with my Samsung phone, and I screwed around, screwed around, and it  finally came down to the front. 
[03:47:30]  On the phone, we'll not support the app anymore.  I'm not going to take technical advice from this guy.  I don't think there's any way.  This phone just sucks, period.  This fucking guy insisted on calling, like, three times.  It's like, who cares?  You having call screen issues, Sal?  Call screen frustrations?  Hashtag call screener problems?  No.  Sal was, I think Sal was getting a lot of calls during that last segment.  You were?  Oh, my God.  People were so confused.  They were just like, what is this?  I have no idea what this is.  Well, because, I mean, especially, like, if you tune in halfway through, and it was a  90-minute segment, so odds are that people did not listen from the beginning. 
[03:48:00]  And we were just playing those.  Eric, when did you decide to make the transition from Marvin Gaye, kind of 70s soulful music to,  you know, 90s, a 90s lovemaking CD?  Um, when I realized I knew more 90s music, because I wasn't alive in the 70s.  Troy, as a DJ, did you appreciate E-Rock's music selection?  Because if you'll notice, there were transition points.  He started with that Marvin Gaye stuff, and then he kind of went into the 90s stuff. 
[03:48:30]  And if you notice for a moment, he went even back further towards the 80s, more white people music.  And then he went with that for a while, and it seemed like, as a DJ, did you think he set the mood in here?  Well, there's one thing I gotta give Eric props for, it's his music selection.  Anytime there's ever, like, a music selection of something like that, Eric always pulls through.  And he knows when to take advice, and when to hold back a little bit.  Yep.  Like, we were all running in there with music choice selections and stuff like that.  Oh, you should play that, you should play this.  Eric was like, yeah, maybe. 
[03:49:00]  Let's see if I can squeeze it in.  Eric would make a good DJ.  You think so?  Yeah, because he knows how to make it flow good.  You ever thought about doing that, Eric?  You ever thought about being a club DJ?  No, not really.  What would your DJ name be?  DJ Sex?  Sexy B.  If I'm doing the clubs, why not?  Sexy B?  Yeah.  Sexy B.  DJ Sexy B.  For the party.  Would you rap a little bit, too?  Nah.  He'd MC.  Yeah, he'd MC a little bit, right?  A little bit, sure.  He'd let the people know that he's...  My name's Sexy B, and I came to party.  Now, where are all the ladies? 
[03:49:30]  Yep.  Entree does rhyme with Sexy B.  But, he'd probably squeeze in entree somewhere along there.  I would.  Something like that?  Sure, why not?  I'd like to see Eric DJ.  Would you let Eric jump on your set for a little while?  No.  If you were a DJ?  You wouldn't let that happen.  You've got a career to worry about.  Yeah.  You don't have that kind of faith in him.  No, I mean, I'd like to see him DJ like a party or something here.  When are you...  In here?  Or like, maybe if he has a party at his place.  Well, the Christmas party was last night, wasn't it?  Yeah.  Did you guys go?  Yeah.  It was at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  And they don't even, like...  Like, we went to...  I went to Jess's.  A lot of people didn't show up.  I went to...  Of course they didn't.  I went to Jess's.  There was nothing...  I went and got a cavity filled instead.  I was happy with that choice.  I went to Jess...  You probably had the right choice.  Yeah.  I went to Jess's work party.  She works in Connecticut.  And, like, they rented a room in New York City.  And, like, everybody was excited.  And there was a dance floor.  And one of the women that she works with is married to Alex Winter from Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. 
[03:50:30]  So he was there.  So it was like, fuck yeah.  You know?  Everybody was happy.  It was like, this is a party.  And we get these emails.  Did Jess have cold food at her party?  No.  I mean, I had...  We had plenty of cold food.  Yeah.  The food was all cold.  And Jess...  Shit!  Can I tell you something, Roland?  Jess's work party?  Yeah.  Carving stations.  Carving stations.  The only carving station was me shitting it out.  Well, I want to say that we got this email that the SiriusXM holiday get-together is in the lobby. 
[03:51:00]  They've done that the past couple years.  5 p.m. on a Thursday?  Yeah.  Well, they used to...  When I first started here, they used to have it at the Hard Rock in Times Square.  Uh-huh.  And it was just open bar, open buffet.  It was so much fun.  People were dancing.  Really?  People were having a good time.  People were so excited about it.  And then now it's like this, like, lukewarm...  Like, the food wasn't...  It was cold.  It was cold.  I mean, the sliders, you go, oh, look, it's cold.  And then the guy brought out those crab cakes. 
[03:51:30]  It was, like, soaked in grease, cold.  But Roland was double-fisting the entire time.  Oh, yeah.  Were people getting drunk in the lobby?  I was.  Yeah, he was.  But was Roland, like, setting the pace?  Or was he just, oh, Roland's drunk?  Roland has two switches on and off.  And it's just like, when it's on, it's like full fucking throttle.  But were other people drinking?  Like that?  Not to that point.  No.  But, I mean, he was pounding them.  Yeah. 
[03:52:00]  I mean, that's like last week when I was DJing.  He came out and he was pounding tequila shots.  Why did you go, first of all?  Because I want to see what they have to offer.  Because then if you don't go, you can't complain.  You were hoping for some delicious food.  I was like, you know what?  What word would you have wanted to describe the food as?  Edible.  That couldn't happen.  No.  And then let me bring you...  Roland gets very upset when he has expectations for an event  and the food is not to his liking.  Roland knows quality food.  He really does. 
[03:52:30]  Send me the budget and I'll send you five choices.  And fuck, why don't we do this?  Go there and have a tasting menu.  They apparently didn't have it there.  And then the worst of all,  they have like three trays of veggie sliders  for five people who are probably vegetarians.  Veggie sliders.  Exactly.  They're stacked so high because nobody else is vegetarian  probably with five people.  Tiny little vegetarian hamburgers.  Yeah.  And there's only five vegetarians at SiriusXM.  I'm assuming.  So why have the whole platter?  Because all the slider trays were...  Stacks on stacks of veggie sliders. 
[03:53:00]  Yes.  But there's just five vegetarians.  I'm assuming.  One would.  Yeah.  And then you could probably give it to a homeless guy.  He'll throw it at you.  That's what he would do instead of eating it.  Homeless people are so hungry, Roland.  Next time I'll bring a frozen dinner  because it's the same temperature as his food.  He was even complaining...  You wouldn't heat it up, the dinner?  They didn't?  Wow.  He was complaining about the cupcakes too.  I don't know if you've ever had frozen dinners.  I mean, they're so cold they will hurt your teeth.  Oh, no.  Unless you heat them up.  That's why most people will put them in the oven. 
[03:53:30]  So I threw away everything and said, fuck it.  Double fist it.  He had a bite of a cupcake.  The cupcakes looked delicious.  I didn't have one.  But he took one bite and he just went...  Spit it out in the trash can.  What the hell?  Well...  What was wrong with the cupcakes?  I thought, how do you get a cupcake wrong?  Well, somebody stored it wrong.  The guy is too cold.  It's hard.  I'm like, what the fuck?  It was a cold cupcake?  Yes.  It wasn't moist?  The only thing that was moist was my asshole at the end of the night.  Why would you...  Did you lube it up?  Yeah, might as well. 
[03:54:00]  You gotta get the shit out.  How did this party go?  He was lubing up his asshole by the end of it?  I just drank.  I don't know.  Moist asshole?  I just hugged out for a little bit.  I said, forget the food?  Yeah.  I said hi to some people and then I...  Apparently, you missed a whole weird scene.  I went to another party.  Was it with serious people?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  This was an awesome party.  Oh.  This was like a masquerade party.  Masquerade?  What, like Eyes Wide Shut?  No, kind of.  That's what I was thinking.  Just people banging each other?  But it was in this old Jewish synagogue down on the Lower East Side and they had this crazy  lighting in there.  It looks evil. 
[03:54:30]  And they had like...  Everybody was like all...  Why would a synagogue let you have an evil party in there?  Because I don't...  It doesn't...  They don't use it anymore.  Oh.  So they turned it into like a...  Was it a Hanukkah party?  No, it was a Yusuf party.  What's that?  What is that?  UNICEF?  UNICEF, sorry.  UNICEF.  I see.  UNICEF is not an evil organization.  No, no, no.  It didn't look evil.  But it just had like weird lighting in the ceiling.  No, it didn't look satanic.  Devilish.  You know, like an old synagogue has certain...  Like if it's built in the late 1800s, it has cool architectural features. 
[03:55:00]  So if you light it weird, it's going to look odd.  Like synagogues?  I've always found synagogues to be very like Jew-y.  You know what I mean?  But like what's Jew-y mean?  Like, you know, it's a synagogue where Jewish people worship.  Well, I understand that, but what does that mean?  Nothing.  It was a joke.  It's obviously...  Who goes to a synagogue?  Jewish people.  Well, that's what I meant.  Okay.  But it was a lot of fun.  Roland, you didn't have fun.  I just got wasted tonight.  I started yelling Merry Christmas to everybody.  He did?  He was screaming at the bosses.  Merry Christmas!  Which ones? 
[03:55:30]  All of them.  Yeah, like Merry Christmas.  Like the boss bosses?  Yeah.  Merry Christmas to everybody.  Nobody was saying Merry Christmas.  Roland doesn't mind making a fool out of himself in front of higher-ups.  Because it's Christmas.  Oh, I see.  You're supposed to forgive and forgive and move on.  So I have to wish everybody Merry Christmas.  Right.  Right.  Good for you, Roland.  Yeah, everybody was just like quiet looking around like, Merry Christmas.  Some people are offended by that statement, though.  Merry Christmas?  Right.  Well, it was a holiday gathering.  Right.  Yes.  Some people want to take the Christ out of Christmas.  Right.  Well, they took the edible and taste out of the food. 
[03:56:00]  The flavor out of the food.  Everything.  Yeah.  And fun out of party.  Roland's idea of forgiving and forgetting apparently is coming on the show and talking  about how horrible the food was last night.  Well, I mean, in his defense, he's not lying.  It was bad food.  It was not good.  Not good.  It was cheap.  So you showed up at the party hungry.  You had to go eat at the party you went to for UNICEF.  And UNICEF, I mean, they don't need to be feeding people.  They're trying to give money to charity.  And they save animals, probably.  Yeah.  But Troy is showing up and he's like, look, I don't want to eat your food, but I came 
[03:56:30]  from a place that was not good.  But I love drunk Roland.  And we're a week away from him and I in Vegas.  And that's going to be dangerous.  That's scary.  Yep.  At least I know there'll be good food there.  At least you know there'll be good food there.  Yeah.  We're going to hit some buffets.  Well, I know some good places.  You know some good places?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Oh, good.  Oh, good.  And last week when we were at Los Feliz, I was DJing and Roland was there.  I'm back there DJing again tonight.  So hopefully Roland makes it out.  Are you going to show up?  Yes. 
[03:57:00]  Roland's in a rare form.  He's in the holiday spirit.  I'd like to know if he survives this holiday season.  To tell you the truth.  I love Christmas.  You just scream, Merry Christmas.  And it's all right.  Well, you just scream other things throughout the year.  I mean, it's just the difference of what you're saying.  You're just screaming at people.  Oh, this one's more polite.  True.  It's much more polite than just screaming AIDS at people.  Yeah.  Dan.  Yeah.  How you doing, buddy?  Good, dude.  Hey, I sent some photos that I took off the TV from the concert of Bruce's big old package 
[03:57:30]  there, the reason why I call him the boss, I guess, to the O.P. Anthony email address.  All right, cool.  We're looking at pictures right now.  Sal, why don't you go back to the beginning of that?  See if Roland, I'm sure you've noticed this before.  Or the top, yeah, no, this one.  Yeah, that one.  Look at that.  Look at that, Roland.  You see that?  What do you think of that, Roland?  We're looking at a photo of Bruce Springsteen's massive balls.  And you can clearly see the definition.  You can see the shaft, the head, the balls.  There's wear in his jeans.  Right.  I mean, his jeans are, you know how, like, when your jeans hit your knees a lot, they 
[03:58:00]  tend to, you know, get holes in them?  The cockhead is rubbing against the jeans so much that it's going to flop out.  That's why he's the boss.  He's the man.  You happy about that?  Hey.  That's why he is where he is.  John.  Because he has a big dick?  No, I don't know.  No, the reason he's been a recording artist for so long is because he has a massive penis.  John in Tennessee.  Hey, Sam Roberts, the greatest broadcaster ever.  Thank you.  Hey, um, you're good friends with Roland there. 
[03:58:30]  Does he have a tendency to exaggerate some of his stories?  He does.  From time to time.  All right.  Now, if my memory serves me correct, earlier in the week he told us a story about how he  was out in Vegas, and he walked into the lake at the Bellagio and put his foot on one  of the sprayers.  Into the fountain.  I can put my foot on the sprayer.  Into the fountain.  He said, the story earlier this week or last week was that Roland was in Vegas with one  of his Carson Daly stories, and they were at the Bellagio, and he got into the fountain 
[03:59:00]  of Bellagio, and before he had the chance to put his foot on the jet, he was tackled  by security because...  Before I was able to reach it.  Because the jet would have chopped his foot off.  Okay.  Now, how close did he get to the sprayer there?  Um, not too close because they tackled me early.  They tackled you.  They don't want that happening, Roland.  On their watch, they don't need little Mexican boy's feet.  Oh, no, no.  I was, like, I was far, I was, like, early in, not deep in, and they just would grab 
[03:59:30]  me, drag me out.  Okay, because you wouldn't have been able to walk out to it because where the jets are  is ten and a half foot deep.  Well, I mean, you didn't get out there.  I didn't get out there.  You went into the fountain.  I went in, took a few steps, and got tackled.  All right.  I don't think, I mean, if Roland was lying about this, he would have a better story.  You know, and I don't think it's like that.  No, I just jumped over, took a few steps towards it, and the guy just tackled me and left me  back in.  Plus, you were drunk, and it happened years ago.  They're trying to get you on details that you're just like, no, I mean, again, if you 
[04:00:00]  were lying, you'd lie better than that, I would hope.  Oh, I was like, oh.  If you're going to, Roland, if you're going to lie to me, make it interesting, is all I'm  saying.  Oh, those four hookers and blow.  Hello, James in Utah.  What is happening, buddy?  How's it going?  Excellent.  Hey, Roland, when you did your podcast, I called in to see if I could come party with you in  New York.  You did a podcast, Roland?  What podcast?  What he did his restaurant review a couple weeks ago.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, the food court. 
[04:00:30]  Oh, yeah.  Food court.  I remember this guy.  I asked you if I could come party with you in New York, but if you're coming to Vegas,  that's two and a half hours from you.  I want to party with you fuckers.  Will you party with the listeners?  I mean, it depends.  You know.  What do you mean?  What?  Well, it depends what's going on.  You know what I mean?  Like, you wouldn't be like, this is the spot we're going to?  Well, you say, like, I don't know who this guy is.  He sounds like a cool dude.  But say you get out there and you're like, okay, man, we'll party.  And then you get out there and you're like, oh, dude, you know, you're.  You think James might be lame?  No, I didn't say that. 
[04:01:00]  I just don't know.  Or you're going to stick up your ass.  Or Troy and I do something really stupid and we go, bro.  Bro, we won't talk about it.  James.  This is also real salty dicks on Twitter.  If anybody cares.  His Twitter name is real salty dicks.  He can't be that lame.  Salty dicks.  Salty dicks.  He sounds like a fun guy.  Hey, listen, if you're out and about, we run into you somewhere in Vegas.  Right on.  Tweet it out, brothers.  Love you guys.  Thanks.  All right.  Bye, James.  I thought you guys.  That doesn't sound like.  I mean, if you're abroad.  Yeah, I thought you were cool, though. 
[04:01:30]  If you're abroad and you're like, oh, hey, want to go party with Roland Troy.  He has his picture.  Gary in California.  Hey, Roland.  How's it going, man?  All right.  Roland's very unsure of these callers.  My stomach's killing me.  If you're feeling giddy about the boss's big cock, just as Sam was giddy when he found  out about Hulk Hogan's big thermosized dick.  Well, I mean, when I found out that Hulk Hogan had a thermosized dick, I said, this is great 
[04:02:00]  news.  You know what I mean?  This is fabulous because, you know, Hulk Hogan's a little bit embarrassing.  You know, he walks around in yellow tights.  He's a wrestler.  He's like, he's got a goofy handlebar mustache.  He's got a skullet, for God's sake.  When you find out he's got a massive dick, it's like, oh, cool.  All right.  So there's something, you know, there's something I could throw in somebody's face.  Yeah.  But before you make fun of the Hulkster, keep in mind, he has genitals the size of a thermos.  What do you think?  Is this how you feel about Bruce?  Well, I mean, I wouldn't ask him like you asked your hero. 
[04:02:30]  You wouldn't ask Bruce?  No.  If you had the chance to interview Bruce Springsteen, you wouldn't be like Bruce.  You could do it delicately.  Like the way you did it?  Here's what I would do.  I would go, you know, we're Bruce Springsteen here.  Now, Bruce, you know, you've been at this for so long and you're known for your live performances.  When you do a show that's televised and you walk away with people commenting on things like, you know, the bulge in your pants, what does that make? 
[04:03:00]  What do you think of that?  No.  And then you kind of get, and then you go, you know, so what is the bulge in your pants really about?  You start asking questions that way.  That's you interviewing them.  You wouldn't ask him about the bulge in his pants?  Why not?  Because.  I don't think you could even interview him.  You couldn't interview him?  Well, that's why I'm the interviewer.  No, he's so starstruck.  That's why I'll just book it and pass it on to you who I know.  Would absolutely talk to him about his bulge.  Yeah, like you did to Gene Simmons and Hulk Hogan. 
[04:03:30]  You asked those uncomfortable questions.  Like, hey guys.  Like, oh, look at this young guy.  Well, you gotta be asked some uncomfortable questions, because otherwise, what separates  you from anybody else?  Well, that's why you do what you do.  I'm not doing any fluff pieces, Roland.  I know.  So can you book me a Bruce Springsteen interview?  Because I'd like to find out the skinny on his bulge.  No pun intended.  He's back on tour next year.  Next year.  Are you gonna go check him out again?  Yeah.  Good.  You know what I wanted to talk about yesterday, but didn't get to it?  E-Rock, do you have the first 30 seconds of yesterday's Opie and Anthony show? 
[04:04:00]  I did.  Give me a minute.  Let me get it.  Let me find that.  Do you want to do your read while I do that?  Yeah, thank you for reminding me.  It's gift-giving season, E-Rock.

Because I would like to hear this.  It wasn't really addressed much.  But I found it very interesting because Opie was gone, obviously, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday this week.  And a lot of people were asking what happened.  Okay? 
[04:06:00]  And then, yesterday, everybody's talking about the show.  And we all got wrapped up in Quentin Tarantino.  And we spent, like, you know, a long time talking about 12-12-12 concert.  And it was a great show yesterday.  Yesterday was a really good show, actually.  But, in all the sort of 12-12-12 stuff, in all this great interview with Quentin Tarantino,  we all lost sight on a pretty big statement that Opie started the show with.  Do you have it, Eric?  Yes.  All right, let's play it. 
[04:06:30]  Hi.  Me and Anthony had a fight.  Danny's fired.  Good morning, everybody.  You guys didn't even talk about that?  What's wrong with you?  Well, you aren't here.  Nah, we just kind of let it ride.  Good morning, everybody.  That was a dull moment.  Yeah.  Anyway.  Yeah.  And that's it.  That fucking concert last night.  Yeah, and then they went to 12-12-12.  But why would you discuss that?  I don't know.  There's a lot there.  Like, I think it's obvious now. 
[04:07:00]  I mean, Opie and Anthony are on good terms right now.  Right.  But based on that statement, I think we can fairly well assess that Opie and Anthony got  into a huge fight.  Okay.  So...  Off the air, obviously, because we didn't hear it.  But why...  But there's a big...  Another...  Besides the fight, there's another big chunk to that statement that's missing.  When Opie said Danny got fired?  Like, why is that never brought up?  I don't know.  But it's true.  Danny got fired.  And I don't know if we're talking about why or not, to tell you the truth.  So we have to...  But I have to tell you something.  I have to tell you this. 
[04:07:30]  These aftershows...  Yesterday's aftershow was a breeze.  But Monday and Tuesday...  You were going nuts.  I was going insane.  Because I knew all this was going on.  And it's the only thing on my mind...  Why do you think I was calling so many people in this show?  I was calling in Troy and Roland to talk about Carson Daly.  Monday, I'm talking to Jenny Hutt about God knows what.  And I love Jenny Hutt with all my heart.  And I love Nicole with all my heart.  And I love DJ Who Kid with all my heart.  But the only reason I had him in was to distract myself.  Because that's all that was on my mind. 
[04:08:00]  Did it feel like the last days at NEW, where they had Brian Regan and had to talk about everything else but...  But what was going on?  Yeah.  Like, all they wanted to do was...  Yeah, when the last days of NEW, when they were getting fired...  They knew they were getting fired, or in the process of it, for the Sex for Sam thing.  They knew this was going on around them, but they could not talk about it.  But I understand that.  But why would you not talk about it?  I don't know why they haven't talked about Danny.  And why do we have to listen about Joe DeRosa's crying childhood?  You didn't like that.  I mean, it's just like, come on, dude. 
[04:08:30]  There were calls saying he was unfunny.  I mean...  DeRosa, he wasn't funny today.  There's staff members that think he's not funny.  I don't know if that was the point.  Multiple staff members.  I don't think he was supposed to be funny, but he wasn't funny today.  Sam's glazing over that statement, but he knows that's the truth.  Yeah, I just said he wasn't funny.  You don't think Joe DeRosa's funny?  He wasn't today, and he wasn't...  I mean, he...  One thing Joe DeRosa said that's funny, ever since he's been on the show.  Jeez, you're putting me on the spot.  What's the Joe DeRosa...  What's the staple Joe DeRosa bit on this show? 
[04:09:00]  Just...  I'm just curious.  I just want to know your thoughts.  It starts with Joe DeRosa hates...  And then fill in the blank.  I guess he likes trannies?  And music.  And gilfs.  Music?  I don't know.  And trannies.  Who started the tranny thing?  With Jim.  Okay, so...  That was Norton, obviously.  Okay, so...  That was Norton.  So somebody else had already tackled that bit.  Yeah, I mean...  So name one other funny Joe DeRosa bit.  He likes older women in, like, 50s.  I guess he likes Rush.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I can't off the top of my head, Troy.  Oh, he dated Nicky... 
[04:09:30]  How about this?  I'll give you a...  Think about it over the weekend.  Just next week, some point...  You want me to come back to you on Monday with something?  Yeah!  Okay.  Just give me the one...  Just give me one Joe DeRosa bit.  That's just like, holy fuck.  Hang on.  Jack in New Mexico.  Troy still has some Joe DeRosa venom, which I love.  We don't have a lot of time, though.  We got all these topics to cover now.  What's up, Jack?  Yeah, which would be fine if Joe was there to fucking defend himself.  If Danny Ross got fired, it's a fucking glorious day.  Well, yeah, he got fired.  Why is that?  Why is that? 
[04:10:00]  Why'd he say that?  Because Danny Ross was a fucking cancer on the show.  Jesus Christ.  His animation and his animation on every word that he said made me sick.  All right.  Well, Jack, everybody's got an opinion, but...  I mean, yeah, he's not a bit.  Like, I love the people who theorize that, like, everything's bits.  There are no bits on this show, especially now.  There's never any bits.  And the story behind it is so fucking funny.  It'll come out.  Will it?  I think so. 
[04:10:30]  I think so.  I wouldn't do it now.  I'm not going to bring it out because it's Opie and Anthony's thing.  No, I know.  It's not my job.  I'm just wondering why would you gloss over that?  I don't know.  I mean, they didn't get to it.  I'm going to see...  I don't know.  I'm just kidding.  You know, Opie and Anthony know good radio.  Sure they do.  But I can't tell that story because that's their story to tell.  But yeah, Danny's gone.  And that was something that Opie said once at the beginning of yesterday's show that  I thought that maybe we could, you know, it's a big deal. 
[04:11:00]  He was with the show for eight years.  Yeah.  I mean, he's in studio for how many years?  Yeah.  I mean, and his voice is still on half our production.  He's not with the show anymore, Danny.  That's not...  It wasn't a joke that...  Like, it wasn't Opie starting to get a joke.  Him and Anthony got into a fight, which they've settled, which they're all good now.  And that's legit, obviously, because they've been doing shows together.  And yeah, Danny is not working for the show anymore.  So...  Wow.  It's weird stuff going on.  Frank in Green Bay. 
[04:11:30]  Yeah, I just want to know.  Last week sometime, Danny called some listener at his house three times.  Is that the reason he got fired?  No.  I'll say that.  I can say that.  Danny...  I mean, the thing about the after show is nobody in management listens to it.  Like, that's why, you know, I get treated like I'm a piece of shit, because I'm not  an actual host in any of their eyes.  You're just filling the airtime.  I mean, I went...  They're doing this Hunger-Thon charity auction on SiriusXM.com, right?  And they're auctioning off different prizes, okay? 
[04:12:00]  Like, I'm looking down the list, and they're going co-host with Jenny Hutt.  Or, no, sit in the studio with Jenny Hutt.  Sit in the studio with Pete Dominick.  Sit in with...  Who are these people?  You don't think that...  Pete Dominick has a Fox show.  He's on CNN.  He's a contributor on CNN, but you can't go to CNN and see him.  You're sitting in his radio show.  You...  Nobody thought for a second...  I didn't even know this was going on.  Nobody thought for a second that maybe I would allow a random listener to co-host Opie 
[04:12:30]  and Anthony's after show with me, and that would be a big prize.  But you know why they didn't think that?  Because they don't realize the show exists.  No.  And by the way, the fight, Opie and Anthony's thing, that didn't have anything to do with  Danny's firing either.  I think we have to go.  Luke in Massachusetts wants to know something real quick before we go.  Luke?  Yeah, are you guys hiring?  No, I'm taking all his money.  Give it to...  We don't need anybody else.  Was this the way for you to get your raise? 
[04:13:00]  Yes.  I had Danny fired.  Can I say something real quick?  Yeah.  I'm DJing tonight at Los Feliz in the Lower East Side, and Roland's going to be there drunk.  Oh, yeah.  Everybody check it out in New York.  I'll be pissing on a phone booth.  We got to go.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Hopefully, we'll talk more about all this stuff next week.  Or maybe not.
