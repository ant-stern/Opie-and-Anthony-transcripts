<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion among Opie, Tom Papa, and Joe DeRosa about a nanny who murdered two children on the Upper West Side.  The horrifying event spurred a conversation about the anxieties of parenthood in NYC, particularly the difficulty of finding trustworthy nannies and cleaning help.  Each host shared unsettling anecdotes about their own experiences with childcare providers.  Ron Bennington joined the conversation, adding his own experiences with unreliable childcare, including a nanny who took his six-month-old baby on a questionable subway trip. The discussion then shifted to the impending "Frankenstorm" and its potential impact on Halloween plans, touching on Halloween traditions in different locations, particularly Ron Bennington's Philadelphia background.  The conversation further meandered through topics including tattoos, the contrast between being able to afford outsourcing tasks and having to do them oneself, and reflections on careers in comedy and radio.  Joe DeRosa’s self-deprecating humor and anxieties were prominent, punctuated by joking barbs exchanged between the hosts about their respective career achievements. A running joke about Jay Thomas's supposed dislike of Opie and Anthony also featured.  Finally, Joe DeRosa promoted his web series, “What Are We Waiting For?”

The next segment focused on Ronnie B's new Warner Brothers web series, a satire of modern music culture through the lens of a 70s/80s music fanboy.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton appeared in the series, along with other comedians. A clip was played featuring Opie's line, "I bet you do, because you're a freaking retard." The conversation expanded to include the musicians featured (Lindsey Buckingham, Sheryl Crow, Phil Collins, Metallica, and Cat Williams), backstage stories, including a negative encounter with Sting, and detailed accounts of seeing Rush live. A caller, Sal, a self-proclaimed hipster and Rush fan, joined the discussion about Rush's discography.  The hosts also debated Led Zeppelin's alleged plagiarism of black blues artists, referencing Steely Dan’s Donald Fagan (a recent guest) and playing a clip of Spirit's "Taurus" to compare with Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven."  Humorous tangents, including references to "tit headphones" (a previous segment involving large-breasted women using their breasts as makeshift headphones), and a hypothetical lifeboat scenario involving legendary guitarists were also included.  Tom Papa and Joe DeRosa were mentioned as being in the studio.

The show then delved into a discussion of the movie *Planes, Trains, and Automobiles*, focusing on John Candy's performance and the emotional impact of a vulnerable scene nearly cut from the film. This led to a broader discussion of favorite movies, including *Home Alone* and a heated debate about *A Christmas Story 2*. The conversation continued into a lengthy critique of Led Zeppelin's alleged plagiarism and a passionate defense of Frank Zappa's music, including one host's emotional response to a Dweezil Zappa tribute concert.  Further discussion covered the relative merits of various artists and bands (Rolling Stones, Rush, Faith No More, Bad Religion, Spoon, Cake), culminating in the hosts revealing their top five bands. The segment also touched upon preparations for the "Frankenstorm," childhood anecdotes (Boy Scouts, family dynamics), a Chuck Berry concert recollection, and a remote contribution from Tom Green.

A segment dedicated to drinking followed, sparked by Tom Green's hangover and the arrival of Ron White's scotch.  The hosts and guests (Ron Bennington, Joe DeRosa, Tom Papa, and Tom Green, with a call-in from Jim Jefferies) discussed their drinking habits and experiences.  Jim Jefferies, about to become a father and currently sober, was teased relentlessly about his impending fatherhood.  The conversation also covered Jefferies’ upcoming comedy special and TV show, the "Frankenstorm,"  a Canadian comedian's legal troubles for homophobic and sexist remarks, conspiracy theories (JFK, MLK, 9/11), Tom Green's rickshaw ride through Times Square, and the existence of a diamond planet.  The segment was rife with vulgar language and offensive humor.

The final segment focused on Tom Green's upcoming Newfoundland tour.  The hosts initially mocked a Newfoundlander's hip-hop video, then pivoted to discussing Newfoundland's culture, geography, history, and the large number of 9/11 diverted flights that landed there.  Tom Green discussed his Caroline's show and plans to drink with Bubbles from the Trailer Park Boys.  Calls from Newfoundlanders described the weather, food (cod, lobster), women, and the Newfoundland Standard Time zone, including an explanation of the "screeched-in" initiation ritual.  A significant portion involved a call with Tom Green's mother, Mary Jane, discussing past pranks from his MTV show, including a decapitated cow's head and another involving a statue that resulted in Oprah sending his parents to Tahiti.  The show concluded with further discussion of Tom Green's tour, his YouTube channel, Ron White's gifted scotch (which Tom Green gave away), and a brief, light-hearted appearance by Kelly Festooka, co-host of the “You Know What Dude” podcast.  A concluding segment briefly touched on a previous segment featuring Kelly Festuca and nearly ruining an intern's relationship, a prank call featuring Sal's mom and her sexual fantasies about Barry Manilow (considered for inclusion in a future show), promotion of Opie's appearance on the Sam Roberts show (with Linda Blair and Rick Springfield), and upcoming guests Ron and Fez and Rob Bennington.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Do it!  Ah, you're right, Joe.  You're right.  Having a therapy session with Joe DeRosa before the show.  Talking him off a ledge.  Yeah, this was not my intention.  When I invited my pals to do radio with me today because it's over.  I'm playing solo.  My God, I'm playing solo!  And now someone's about to jump off the side of the... 
[00:00:30]  Hey, Joe DeRosa came in and depressed the hell out of everyone.  Wow, that was heavy.  I was already sad because two kids got stabbed to death in my neighborhood last night.  I totally forgot about that now.  I know.  Jeez.  Jeez, Tom.  Just when I thought I couldn't be more depressed, Joe DeRosa walked into the studio.  Wow.  But you helped me.  He needs his own nanny.  Did I help you?  You talked me down for a second.  All right, that's good.  I was a little sad for a minute.  You talked me up. 
[00:01:00]  And now I'm ready to...  Let's have some fun with the Elmster!  We're going to have fun.  It's Friday.  Friday, yes.  Wow.  Yeah, me and Tom, being parents, we were discussing this stabbing on the Upper West Side.  It's on every fucking channel.  Horrible.  I saw the helicopters in the sky yesterday.  I was two blocks from that scene.  Jeez.  Walking around with my new daughter, just getting some fresh air.  Loving life.  And when I got home, they said five people were stabbed on the Upper West Side.  I'm thinking it was one of these lunatics that, you know, every once in a while, hits Manhattan. 
[00:01:30]  Just running through the streets?  Yeah, causing mayhem.  Yeah.  So I tell my wife, I'm like, man, I was two blocks away from where those five people were stabbed.  Because that's what they said early on.  And a helicopter's just in the sky, and I knew it was the news.  Did you hear this story?  Not until just now.  How old were the kids?  How about you let me and Tom talk for a little bit?  Because I don't want you to get more depressed.  You just take deep breaths.  You want to go down the hall?  You just take deep breaths.  You want to get some fresh air? 
[00:02:00]  Write some affirmations on paper and read it to yourself.  I am good.  You're going to be okay if we discuss this is adult shit.  It'd make me feel better.  Could I stand in the corner and say I'm not a bad boy?  Yeah, well, let us talk, and it'll put your life in perspective.  Turns out it's every parent's fucking nightmare.  The worst nightmare to anybody that's ever had to leave anybody to watch your children as you go out.  Which is a big step, as you know, right?  Oh my God, I'm two and a half years into parenthood, and I still don't trust anybody. 
[00:02:30]  It's a tough thing.  I barely trust my own sister when she comes in and watches my kid.  Now kids.  Yeah, it's a scary thing.  You're really trusting their life, literally trusting their life with this person.  Especially in New York, there's a big network of women who watch kids, and you get referrals, you try it, and it's all kind of vague, you know?  Even like the official ones.  It's like, you know, we have her.  She was good for a couple of years. 
[00:03:00]  And that's what this one was.  This one was checked out and was okay.  And this woman comes home to a luxury building after working all day.  Right.  Really nice building.  It seems like both parents are, you know, hustling, doing careers, which happens a lot in Manhattan, obviously.  You know, there's people, and I'm not saying this is the situation here, they have kids, and then they have someone else kind of raise them,  because they've got their own lives and careers to take care of. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  And, you know, if you need two incomes in Manhattan, that's the way you do it.  Right.  And these nannies watch these, because they're part of the family, these nannies.  They travel with you, you know, they're in there all the time.  So then the story was updated when I got home, and it turns out, yeah, this nanny stabbed to death a five-year-old and a three-year-old,  and then tried to kill herself.  She had a fucking knife sticking out of her neck.  This is horrific.  In the tub.  In the tub, and, you know, I have no problem saying this. 
[00:04:00]  As soon as the news said the two kids died, I just grabbed my face.  I didn't start crying, but it goes right to your fucking soul.  You immediately picture your children's faces.  Yeah.  Anytime you hear some kind of...  Yeah.  And this one is so off the charts.  And then the mom, they have pictures of her in the paper today, obviously screaming her fucking head off in the back of an ambulance.  It could not be...  Look at that.  It could not be...  You're looking at the worst thing a woman could go through. 
[00:04:30]  Her two children.  Seeing her two children.  Yeah.  Oh, forget it.  This thing is the worst story I've ever heard.  Here's Ron Bennington making his way into the studio.  So, uh...  Another tragedy.  That's brutal.  That's really fucking sad, man.  Hey, Ron.  What's happening to you?  Tom Papa, of course.  Joe DeRosa.  Everyone knows each other.  You know the Sam over there.  I heard Sam wasn't here today.  I'm a big fan of Ron.  I was hoping.  Ron, I truly am.  Well, I'm one of those guys.  Ron was supposed to be the big surprise today. 
[00:05:00]  I love listening to Ron.  Yeah.  We're talking about what happened on the Upper West Side.  You know, we figured we'd start the morning show with some light material.  Try to cheer up Joe.  Well, you and I were just talking about the trouble with finding nannies yesterday.  Yeah.  On the way out.  Really?  On the way out.  Yeah, because I told Ron I don't trust anyone.  And then when this story went down last night, I have a cleaning lady that I do trust.  I wanted to kick her out of my house immediately.  I was like, how about you go home?  Our first one that we picked up here in New York, we found out after day one that she'd 
[00:05:30]  taken our little six-month-old on the subway somewhere.  Like, she went to go meet some friends and then came back and acted like that was cool.  I was like, well, we won't see you again.  Oh, my God.  Thanks for bringing her back alive.  Do you know where she went?  I think...  Crack house.  I had like Washington Heights.  Some kind of drug deal.  Yeah, like Washington Heights or something.  There was no reason to leave our neighborhood and go...  That sounds horrifying.  Yeah.  And you're looking at your little kid who can't even talk and you're like, what did you see 
[00:06:00]  today?  Right, right, right.  Where did you go?  What happened?  Wow.  Yeah, it's terrifying.  Yeah, because your kid can't tell you.  I freak out like...  That six-month-old saw some things that day.  Saw some stuff and you'll never know what it was.  She won't know.  She'll just live with it.  Too bad you can't, I don't know, get into that little brain.  I get nervous when the babysitter is like, we're just going to take them for ice cream  and then going around the corner because I know they're crossing the avenue. 
[00:06:30]  That whole day is shot for me.  Of course.  Are they going to make it?  How are they going to get across?  Does she know how to hold their hand?  Does she know?  Right.  I mean, these are little things.  And then this woman just completely, this nanny just lost her fucking mind for whatever  reason.  We'll find out sooner than later.  Did you see this?  The father was just coming home from his radio show.  I guess he did mornings.  He works at CNBC?  Yeah.  CNBC.  Yeah.  His radio, yeah.  He's a CNBC guy.  I heard he's an executive at CNBC.  Oh, oh.  He really is.  He's trying to get you to relate. 
[00:07:00]  Oh.  Holy fuck.  Because you're never going to be relaxed again once you have kids like this.  You never have another fucking good moment.  No.  Yeah, even good things you cry at once you have kids.  Jesus Christ.  I can't watch any.  I got two girls.  I can't watch anything.  Anything about a girl, a little girl in any movie, TV show, commercial has to just go,  I love you, daddy.  And I am sobbing.  It's true. 
[00:07:30]  My daughter says that.  It's a really close bond.  Yeah, I don't know, man.  But I was telling Tom, this is life in Manhattan.  A lot of families, they're very trusting with nannies.  I've never seen more nannies than I have living in New York.  When I was in the suburbs, you didn't see this as much.  Usually, you had your family around that would come by and help you out.  But in Manhattan, for whatever reason, it's more strangers watching your kids.  Every time I go to the playground, it's just the benches are lined up with nannies on  their smartphones while these kids are just running around. 
[00:08:00]  It's really true.  They're not even watching them at the playground.  Yeah.  And then a kid cries, and then they all look up seeing if it's theirs.  Well, it's that thing in New York.  It's that balance of, do you want to hustle and make a lot of money to stay here and live  that life?  Right.  There's sacrifices, and part of it is not being around during the day for your kids.  We had a cleaning lady that all of a sudden had to leave, and she brought her replacement  to our house. 
[00:08:30]  She basically was telling us, well, she will now be cleaning your house.  Right.  And I'm like, no, she won't.  Who is she?  It was this lady that didn't speak any English, and the one that she was supposedly replacing  barely spoke.  But there was some, I don't know what goes on.  I want to get into this someday.  But I think what happens, it's a network.  Yeah.  I think you get a nanny or a cleaning lady.  They're there for a while.  Then they find someone to take that job, so they get a piece of the action, I think. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  They just pass it off.  It's like the mafia.  It's like, well, now this guy's going to do it.  Right.  And that woman gets a little bit, because she gave her the job.  Wets her beak.  She wets her beak a little bit.  Right.  Thank you, Ron.  Make sure it comes back my wife.  There you go.  That's right.  She goes, she'll be cleaning your house now, in broken English.  I'm like, no.  We'll clean our own house for a while, and we'll go through the proper channel.  Yes, Mr. Opie.  She will be cleaning, Mr. Opie.  No way, man.  Yes, Mr. Opie.  She'll be here tomorrow. 
[00:09:30]  No, no, no.  And, yeah, yes, you'll be here tomorrow.  That's like when you go to the rubdown, and they switch the girl out.  One girl walks you in, then another girl comes in.  I'm going to do you.  We'll have another hot chick, you fucking animal.  Oh, the bait and switch, huh?  Yeah, they do a little bait and switch.  A little bait and switch.  Bait and switch at the Yankee Cranky shop.  Yeah, the old Yankee Cranky will bait and switch your fucking prick.  So, what is it?  The really hot one walks you back?  She's the vibe manager.  Yeah.  She's like, hey.  Hey.  Come on in.  Everything's great here.  Yeah.  I love how Joe's relating to what we're talking about right now. 
[00:10:00]  In his own way.  In his own way.  That's the brilliance of Joe DeRose.  Hey, you know.  I like the guy in the Cranky Place being picky about the looks.  Right.  But Joe will cry if he sees, like, a fucking massage therapist on a commercial.  He'll be like, oh, God.  Yeah, every time I see a broken-down immigrant whore in a commercial, it really looks good.  My last one said that, too.  Who cares? 
[00:10:30]  In the end, it's just a sad hand jerking you off.  Who cares if it's hot or not?  I call it a happy hand, dude.  No, they're not happy.  Oh, those...  Are you happy when that happens?  You're saying it's a happy experience.  To them, it's a very sad experience.  But it's better if they cry.  That's right.  I know.  I'm so gigantic.  I came to America with all these dreams.  I'm so huge.  I came to America with all these dreams.  Well, here's one of them.  Oh, yeah.  This is the latest. 
[00:11:00]  She washes off and then goes off to her nanny job.  Well, me and Ann have talked over the years.  There's, like, three levels with these people.  You start in the Yankee Cranky shop.  You do well.  You do nails.  And then if you do well with nails, you go into the sushi.  And the Chinese joints.  The sushi places do smell exactly like the Yankee Cranky shop.  And nails.  It's the same scent.  And nails.  It's all related.  Yeah, there's a musty wasabi whitefish scent in all these places.  So that's the front page today. 
[00:11:30]  And, fuck, man.  That goes through everyone.  What about the giant storm that's coming to get us?  Frankenstorm.  Frankenstorm.  Yeah.  Frankenstorm.  When's it going to hit?  I'm supposed to fly.  When?  Monday.  That is it, though.  Yeah, no, you're done.  Monday.  Monday's the day?  Yeah, Monday it hits, and then they said last until Tuesday.  You might have to leave early.  Where are you flying to?  Canada.  So why don't you go a day early?  You're going in the right direction.  You're going away from the damn thing.  Canada. 
[00:12:00]  Is it going to fuck up my kid's trick-or-treating?  No.  You sure?  It'll be over by then.  Huh?  That's Wednesday.  Trick-or-treats until Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Yeah, you'll be okay.  Oh, the lines will be down.  Yeah, I know.  The lines are right.  Live wires.  Live wires everywhere.  Kids will think it's a part of the display.  They really went all in this year.  This is cool.  Look at that man on fire.  Huh?  Is this his first year going out?  No, this will be his third.  Wow.  Nice.  Where do you take him in the city? 
[00:12:30]  Well, we go down to Philly.  We go old school.  You do?  Oh, yeah, that's the way to do it.  We'll get a lot of huggies.  Yeah, let me get some bunch of huggies.  Cheese steaks.  Everybody dresses up like Bernie Perrant.  Bags with meat juice dripping out of the bottom.  What'd you get tonight?  I got some super side.  Oh, yeah, we got two Philly guys here today.  I'm in trouble.  You gotta have the cheese whiz.  I didn't know you were from Philly, Ron.  Well, I'm from outside of Philly.  I'm from Delaware County.  Oh, shit.  I'm from, I grew up in college.  I'm out of Norristown. 
[00:13:00]  Real, I was born in Chester.  Yawn!  This is really good stuff.  Let us bond for a minute.  All right, fine.  Don't worry.  Tom, were you doing that, or was that a sound effect?  It's a sound effect.  Ronnie was brought up in a tougher neighborhood than you there, John.  No, no, no.  Delaware County?  That's what, you know.  Yeah?  You got some things done?  Well, I grew up in Chichester.  All right, man.  Oh!  Chichester!  See, he doesn't care.  Tom doesn't care.  I do.  I love Chichester. 
[00:13:30]  No, I go old school with the trick-or-treating.  I go to...  You go to the houses.  I go to the in-laws area, yeah.  We walk around the neighborhoods.  Sure.  We do the city like men.  Do you do the city?  Yeah.  Well, the city, it's...  You do one building.  Yeah, it stinks.  That's why I leave, because I live pretty high up, and you can't use the elevators for the  whole day, because the kids go from floor to floor to floor to floor, and they take  over every single fucking elevator.  We don't do the high-rise.  We do the low-rise.  What do you mean?  There's, like, streets. 
[00:14:00]  The whole streets of it.  Really?  Yeah.  You got to be down...  I stopped talking, because that's really strange.  I don't know how that works.  Well, there's two things.  Because every building has, like, fucking 50 apartments.  You don't know which ones are willing to...  The Sunday before, they do a thing in the village where everybody that has a pumpkin  in the window...  Ah, very cool.  ...gives out candy, so the kids just go crazy through the whole village.  We have one street on the Upper West Side that they close down for Halloween for everybody,  too.  The crazy part is that then the Halloween parade comes through at night, and one time 
[00:14:30]  we popped out, when we first lived in that neighborhood, we popped out of the subway in  the middle of it.  We're just thinking, oh, this is great.  You take the train right to home, and we get out.  It was like Saigon.  It was like Sophie's Choice.  Which kid do you want?  I'll take this one.  I'm putting her on my shoulders, trying to get through transvestites and all this insanity.  People, they just fucking bang in the street.  I was like, dogs that night.  It's true.  They really do. 
[00:15:00]  It's like laid over bicycle racks.  It's disgusting.  Your little kids have seen a lot already, Tom.  They have.  Taking subway rides to God knows where.  You should see gay pride in our neighborhood.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They've seen some...  Look at that man.  Why does he have a feather out of his butt?  It's been enough answering the easy questions.  Yeah.  I just...  My answer to everything is, it's the village.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  How do you answer the hard questions?  Dad, why are those two men doing that? 
[00:15:30]  It's the village.  There's a thing in San Francisco that somebody was telling me about.  Some sort of pride event where the police barricaded off and it's just understood people will be fucking inside the parameter.  Right.  Like the boundaries of this thing.  And when people go in, like tourists or whatever, the cops actually say, be ready for what's going on in there.  And they said that people are having literally orgies on the fucking street, like three guys blowing each other on the hood of a car, like just outside of some fucking pizza place or whatever for this big event. 
[00:16:00]  So did you have a good time?  Here we go.  There we go.  How long did you stay in there?  So just set yourself up.  I didn't hear anything else.  Yeah, I know.  I'm just waiting for my turn.  Why don't you fucking take a shot at Tom over here?  I'm with children.  He's got a family.  He's going down to the cum parade of fucking Halloween.  You sick fuck.  He's got family. 
[00:16:30]  I'm with children.  Didn't you hear the part where they're passing the kids?  Jeez.  Saving children's lives.  His fucking Passover Halloween that he does.  There's a pumpkin in the neighborhood.  It means there's candy inside.  That is terrible, Joe.  I'm with a family.  He's with family, Joe.  All right.  That's fair.  That's fair.  Come on now.  All right.  You're at this.  How is Fez still a virgin?  When you hear these stories of you can just get thrown in the street.  Is he a part of a car?  Yeah.  Is he officially gay?  Really?  Yeah, he's gay.  No, I ask that because if you haven't had the sex, then are you... 
[00:17:00]  Oh, I would say no.  So he's gay, but he's a virgin.  Right.  Yeah, I guess that's possible, right?  It doesn't seem possible.  What is he scared of?  I think a cock.  In general.  They can be scary.  Oh, not so much scary as gross.  I think that he does...  He likes the idea of...  Right.  ...being gay.  It's the actual thing of being gay.  That's what stops him.  It's like borscht.  Yeah.  Everyone says it's good, but it's scary when it gets there. 
[00:17:30]  I don't know.  It's cold beets in a soup.  It's nice.  Just drink it fast, Fez.  It's cold beets.  Oh, God.  I guess that's a big step, man.  You know?  Taking that first fucking cock.  I would imagine.  You know?  It's like, you know...  You can do it.  I thought you were going to jump in with something.  No, no, no.  I'm just losing this.  I hadn't thought about it. 
[00:18:00]  It's a phone with this.  What?  What's wrong with this?  Go ahead.  Just the way you were staring at Ronnie there.  I wasn't proposing a cock to him.  Did it look like I was hitting on Ronnie?  Yeah.  It was a little wank.  Like, yeah, big step, right?  Listen, Ron.  It's like I thought the next thing you were going to say was, we can do it.  Ron, the first time you let a guy suck your cock...  Yeah.  ...on the OB and A&E show.  I mean, it seems like a big step.  It's not so bad, man.  It's not so scary.  It would be a hell of a Friday show if that happened.  That's got to be a huge... 
[00:18:30]  I think that's got to be like getting your first tattoo or something.  You're just fucking like, I want to do this.  I know I want to do it.  I know I believe in it.  You just got a tattoo, right?  I got two tattoos.  But it was fucking scary that first time.  And then fast forward, you got a whole sleeve.  Yeah, that's what happens.  You're just like, cover my body now.  As soon as I got the first one, I was like, I want another one.  I want another one.  I started like, I have like all these tattoo ideas now, and I'm totally into getting all  of them.  But that first one was like, like literally a year of like, oh, Jesus Christ. 
[00:19:00]  You know, like, and then you're in a bar drinking beforehand.  It is a lot of like fucking a guy.  You don't want a prick, the whole thing.  You have to be drinking by yourself.  I can do it.  I can do it.  I can do it.  You don't want to.  You get out of this little shop in the village.  You got a guy drizzling your face.  You don't want to.  You close the door.  It hurts.  You take off your clothes.  It hurts really bad.  So what was the big deal?  You didn't want to ruin your amazing body there, Joe?  Tattoos. 
[00:19:30]  It's, you know, when you have a temple like this, you don't want to.  When you're chiseled like yourself.  So how many tattoos are you going to get?  Do you have a tattoo?  Sorry.  Yeah, a little something.  What do you got, a shamrock?  A little shamrock.  On your ankles.  You got a little something something.  But don't it always feel like it's dirty under your skin?  No, no, not at all.  Like there's something under your skin.  It's called your soul.  No, no.  No, you don't feel it at all.  No, but I mean now.  I just think I need to scrub it.  Do you feel like you have to scrub it off or do you notice that it's even there? 
[00:20:00]  You kind of just don't even realize they're there anymore, you know, which is a shame  because I got these tattoos to like inspire, like there were, I really got them as a form,  as an expression.  Right.  And now I'm like, oh, yeah, my tattoo.  Right.  You know, like, so it's, you kind of feel bad that you lose the steam with it after a little  while.  So, but the only weird thing is like once in a while I forget I have one here.  I have a big one right there, my forearm, and I forget that it's there and then you'll  like wake up and see it and be like, oh, yeah, I did that. 
[00:20:30]  Or you're in a business meeting and you see them glance down as they're saying no to you.  Yeah.  You're like, oh, right.  I have a tattoo.  So, yeah, you know, you're jerking off some executive.  He's like, this isn't the fantasy I paid for.  Or you're supposed to be a tattoo.  Wow.  Wow.  We were talking about tattoos.  Yeah.  You get Joe early in the morning.  There's a lot of fantasies.  Just a lot of truth.  A lot of truth comes out.  A lot of truth comes out.  Awkward.  Would you do the neck tattoos?  No.  I wouldn't.  That's the new thing.  As of now, I wouldn't. 
[00:21:00]  I don't think so.  But I want to do.  I don't think so.  As of now.  It's a possibility?  I don't think so.  I can't see in the future.  I don't think I would do that.  He's going to do it.  I don't know.  I would get, I have two on the forearms.  I'd get, I want to get one here and one here on the back of the arm.  And then I don't know if I'm going to go any farther than that.  Your boyfriend's first and last name.  Yeah, exactly.  It's always that thing of like, this is a story.  This is my father passed away.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:21:30]  Because my baby was born.  Yeah, exactly.  Get a fucking notebook.  What is this about?  It's just the year my mother died.  It's just so low.  It's called a journal.  Right.  It's just fucking cavemen scribbling on the wall here.  Yeah, it's always, this is the screening.  The first time I've seen Star Wars, 12 p.m. AMC.  That's why it says that.  Yeah.  I don't think I would, I don't know, man.  You know, I'll tell you though, today I have an audition for like a, like a game showy 
[00:22:00]  kind of thing and I actually thought like, man, is it, I ended up wearing a sweater just  because, but like, I was like, man, is it bad if I like have tattoos showing?  Is that going to take me out of the element of what this kind of show is?  It's the first time I ever thought about that.  But just wear a long sleeve shirt.  Well, I am right now, but I'm saying my point is, it just never even occurred to me, but  they have makeup, you can cover them and stuff.  Why, you have to wear a short sleeve shirt?  It depends on the show too. 
[00:22:30]  No.  It's just a game show of like people making bad decisions.  You'd be the perfect host.  Here's the thing, Joe, you're just going to be a contestant anyway.  Don't act right.  I don't know whether I should go in like this.  All right.  Oh, host.  No, no.  All right, listen, I'm going to wait online for the prices.  That's it.  That's all it is.  It's going to be an audition somewhere in Jersey.  That's great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When you dress up in your costume. 
[00:23:00]  It's the first time though.  It's probably, it doesn't matter.  You wear a shirt, whatever.  But my point is, this is the first time it ever even occurred to me like, oh, this  is kind of like, it does kind of put you in a certain, um, aesthetic category sometimes.  Yeah.  You're sleazy now.  No, no, no.  I know that, but that's not what I'm saying.  Do you see what I'm saying?  You're sleazy.  Yeah, I know.  Certain people look at that as like, ugh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not everybody.  Just like TV executives and movie producers.  Right.  People like that.  Sailors think it's cool. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Do you have an audition to go on a ship?  We call it an audition necessarily.  That's not the term we use.  The deadliest catch.  Those guys are like that.  That'd be cool.  They would love you.  Yeah.  It's, uh, I couldn't survive in those boats.  No.  Wow.  That's insane.  I take the ferry across to Jersey sometimes.  And that scares you?  I'm nauseous.  You know, the thing is, they don't survive on those boats.  No kidding.  They don't make it.  Yeah.  They all, you know, you see guys are like 33 and they're just all old. 
[00:24:00]  They look sick.  Poop deck happy.  Like, yeah.  Been out of here for six months.  And you're like, all right, dude.  Yeah.  Fuck, I'd shit my pants.  Fuck that.  It really makes you feel like a piece of shit, too, when you're in, like, a restaurant.  How many crab legs do you get?  Right.  You said shit because it's expensive.  What the fuck?  I can get all you can eat at the fucking Chinese place.  You think these guys get flashbacks when they see the crab legs?  Oh, man.  They must, man. 
[00:24:30]  They must.  I would doubt they eat them.  Well, even if when you go out deep sea fishing, you always think, like, pretty early on, I want to go in.  You know, we did this for a while.  This is great.  Yeah, we got to see a couple big fucking swells.  You know, but they never go in.  Never.  They just keep going out.  Yeah, every once in a while, somebody comes out with coffee for them and that's it.  Someone's got to call and just say, look, we don't need fucking crab legs.  Right.  Let's call this.  We're good.  Too many people are dying.  I think we're good.  Just pretend.  It's amazing, though. 
[00:25:00]  Pretend if we were the four guys that had to do any of those jobs, how many things the country  wouldn't have anymore?  There'd be no more crab legs.  Whatever's on those ice road trucks, just gone.  That's not getting to wherever it needs to get.  No, of course not.  And then a bunch of other examples.  Well, any job that you just didn't have to sit around bullshitting.  Any fucking job besides this.  But have you ever worked, like, you know, construction or anything like that?  Just most people are really bad at it.  Just, like, trying to fucking lay block is impossible to me. 
[00:25:30]  It's, I don't understand.  I never had a real, like, intense labor job, but I had a lot of, like, I had a lot of jobs.  Unskilled?  Yeah, like, you know, a lot of food jobs and delivery jobs and moving shit, stuff like  that, and I was just like, I don't know how anybody does anything more strenuous.  Can you build shit?  Huh?  Can you build anything?  I'm not bad with my hands.  Oh, you can build shit.  No, yeah, I'm not bad.  I'm another jerk.  My family.  I'm all right. 
[00:26:00]  My hands are good.  It's just my arms have no strength.  Why'd you get the come off of them?  Oh, come on.  Keep going back there.  Obviously, we're trying to move on.  I'm sorry, Tom.  I'm early in the morning.  You've been steering away from that shit.  You keep bringing us back.  I'm sorry, Tom.  You notice I brought up fucking crab legs?  What are these tattoos?  Out of nowhere.  I'm one of five boys, and two of us have the skills of building anything.  Are you one of the builders?  Hell fucking no.  And then there's three of us that couldn't be bothered with it. 
[00:26:30]  I mean, in what sense?  My brother, cheap plug, but my brother who owns FH Riley's there in Huntington, he rebuilt  the whole fucking place.  Yeah, I can't do shit.  And then my other brother, Scott, could rebuild anything, and then there's three of us that  are just fucking useless.  I can't do shit like that, but if you give me something in a box and you go, you've got  to put this together, I can put it together.  I'm not long.  I understand that.  I didn't even do that, but having kids, you can't.  Something in a box.  Well, how many jobs are like that? 
[00:27:00]  Like, seriously, if you bring me a thing of Legos, I'll totally do it.  All right, the house kit is over there, so step that together.  They've made that shit easy, thank God, because I didn't do even that shit until I had kids.  And now these boxes come in that my wife's ordering, and I'm like, fuck with the instructions.  The worst is when you get the toys and they have that wire wraparound in the back, tied  up with tape.  Right.  You just got to take a razor knife.  Your kid's just waiting for a thing, and you're wielding a razor knife around like the slasher. 
[00:27:30]  What about the hard plastic?  They're finally getting away with that molded hard plastic that could pretty much slice your  wrist in half.  That's the worst.  When you try to pull it apart because you're getting lazy, and you don't want to cut it  all the way through?  Yeah, I got to put you get one slit, and you give up on the cutting.  Just put your foot into it.  And I start yelling.  I'm like, this isn't fun for me.  And my wife's like, relax.  It's just a stupid rocking horse.  You'll figure it out.  Call your brother. 
[00:28:00]  Worse, sometimes I call the maintenance guys to come up and help me with some shifts.  To open up a package.  To help you open toys?  No, just dump shit around the apartment.  Smoke detectors went out.  And I was like, you know what?  I'm just going to call the guy.  I have a maintenance fee in this building anyway.  Let them fucking deal with this shit.  I call for everything.  Anything my wife says, I'm like, call the guy.  Well, they were hardwired.  And I'm like...  I'm like, you know, I would do this, but... 
[00:28:30]  Getting my vagina cleaned.  I got to get the sand out of my vagina.  That's hilarious.  At the nail shop.  I'll be at the nail shop.  Can you fucking do my smoke detector?  That's hilarious.  It's embarrassing, though.  I'm fucking annoyed how those guys get with you.  It's not embarrassing.  You're good at what you do, and they're good at what they do.  But I'm at least...  Putting batteries in.  I'm trying, though.  I'm trying.  What does the plus mean?  Like, I'm getting all fucking nervous because Christmas is on the way.  That means a lot of shit to put together. 
[00:29:00]  That's a lot.  Do you feel like your wife looks at you like you're not a man?  Yeah, of course, because she's from Philly.  Ron knows.  Blue collar.  That's just because he tucks his pee-pee between his legs.  She comes from a blue collar neighborhood.  That's what they do.  Men were men.  Men are men down there.  But you're talking about toys.  What's so hard to put together with these fucking things?  That's why I'm pathetic.  That's why I brought it to the discussion here.  Jesus.  The men's group all of a sudden were in? 
[00:29:30]  My dad actually sat me down because we rebuilt our house when we were growing up.  So I was all in, and I had hammers and shit.  I just wasn't into it with my other two brothers.  I had hammers.  In your mind, it's just a bunch of hammers.  Well, he was trying to cut some corners, so we had the whole top half of our house sliced off,  and we rebuilt to make more rooms and stuff.  Right.  He did that.  He hired the guys to do that.  Then after that, it was like, well, we're going to do a lot of this ourselves. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, boy.  So I was fucking hanging sheetrock and all that stuff.  Really?  As a 12-, 13-year-old.  So why didn't it stick?  Because maybe as a 12-, or 13-year-old, I wanted to be riding my stupid bike and not hanging sheetrock.  So maybe it's a mental thing.  Yeah, you weren't into it.  My dad was the kind of guy.  Oh, did I?  Sorry.  No.  My dad could literally build.  He's mechanically inclined.  He'd literally build a computer from scratch.  You know what I mean?  Right.  And he was always like that. 
[00:30:30]  Then he would try to get me to help him with stuff when I was a kid, and then he'd yell at me  because I wasn't into it.  And it's like, I'm not a building psycho like you are.  Do you know what I mean?  I don't know how to do this.  This is beyond me.  It's like when sometimes there's not that connection with that, and the older people never get it.  And it's like, dude, this is literally like taking somebody to a laboratory and trying to get them to mix chemicals properly or something.  I just want you to be a man.  Yeah.  This is like so foreign right now to me. 
[00:31:00]  No, my dad knew I was on a different fucking trip from early on.  So he sat me down and he goes, look, two things.  You're either going to have to learn how to do this shit when you get older, or you're going to have to make so much money that you can pay someone else.  That sounds good to me.  That's exactly what he told me from an early age.  That's the gay speech.  That's the gay speech.  The guys in that generation.  Right.  You're going to have to dress in fancy clothes.  I mean, he only got two out of the five boys that were into it. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's tough.  I mean, I'm ashamed in this culture how bad we really are at stuff like that.  You know, it really is sad.  Like how much you can throw money at a problem these days.  Like you don't have to do anything.  I have no fucking idea.  I don't own a car.  But you have to have the money.  If you don't have the money, then you got to figure this shit out.  This is a New York problem, though.  You go everywhere else you go.  Men are still men.  They fix their own stuff. 
[00:32:00]  As soon as you go across the river.  As soon as you go across the river.  As soon as you cross either river.  There's guys with tool belts.  Yes.  Getting shit done.  My father-in-law gave me the head.  I got two fucking toolboxes now.  And a whole drill set.  Who's your father-in-law, Tim Allen?  And I'm like, fuck.  I hate it, too.  I'm not into doing any of this stuff.  I don't even know half the shit in these things.  My wife likes it.  My wife likes fixing stuff.  She asked for a drill for Christmas ones. 
[00:32:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  Is she...  Lesbians?  Oh, attachments.  Oh, is that what's going on?  I'm just asking.  I don't know.  How much drilling is she doing?  No, I think we're entertainers.  We're not supposed to be fixing things.  Are you...  Give your hands there, Ron.  I'm fucking amazing fixing shit.  Really?  No.  Fuck.  Okay, good.  But my dad's the same as your dad.  My dad built the house that he's living in now. 
[00:33:00]  He just could do that.  And it just never mattered to me.  You never had an interest in it?  No, I didn't have the whole thing where I had to sit down with him and be like, no.  I'm not doing that.  I had to fucking hang out.  My dad was really good with his hands, but when he was getting older, because he would  rebuild our house all the time.  He got lazy and the molding wouldn't match up anymore.  Oh, yeah.  He would just get scraps from...  We used to have a big garage that was separate from the house that he just...  He would just collect molding from wherever he could find it.  Right.  And then he would kind of patch it together. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  And some of his work at the end there was a little...  Yeah, I have an uncle like that who comes and helps me out.  And he was really good as a young guy.  And now he's just older and high.  And I'm like, yeah, I can do tile.  And my wife was like, no, don't let him do the tile.  I'm like, yeah, it'll save us money.  And then it's all up and down.  And it's all bubbly and fucking not matching.  Jesus.  My dad would collect tile and then, like, you know, and patch it together. 
[00:34:00]  He thought that was a good design.  It's hilarious.  They don't want to waste anything.  But the early days, it was amazing.  It's hard to do the shit.  My dad helped me paint my apartment.  And when I moved in, we went in, and they had done the typical fucking New York landlord paint job on it  where they just painted over the light switches and everything.  So I'm in there, and I'm screaming in this apartment, this is what I'm fucking paying for.  Cocksuckers.  My dad's like, relax. 
[00:34:30]  We're going to paint it right.  It's going to be okay.  Relax.  So we're painting it, and he's like, you know, we got the rollers, and he's like, listen, you just do a little bit at a time.  Just do a little spot at a time.  You dip it again.  You do a little more.  Ten minutes later, I was just rolling over the fucking light switches like, fuck this.  I don't give a shit.  It takes so long to do that shit right.  Yeah.  It's like...  You have no patience.  It's artistry, man.  My cousin's a carpenter, and he talks about carpentry. 
[00:35:00]  And I mean, carpenter in the sense, like, he doesn't whittle ducks and sell them in a market.  You know what I mean?  He works on houses and stores and things.  And he talks about it the way we talk about comedy and radio and stuff.  Like, he fucking loves it.  Of course.  You have to love it like that.  It's his thing.  You know?  You would have to feel great, though, man, just to be able to finish something and then know it's there.  Like, fucking years later, you drive by and say, I did that.  Well, you can't do that in any of our professions.  You're just like, eh, it's done. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, it's out there.  You know what I mean?  It's fucking, at best, the sandcastle.  You know?  It's fucking gone.  Is that all we built?  Yeah, that's it.  Sandcastles.  Sandcastle on low tires.  Sandcastle goes to the fucking ocean.  There's just waves come in.  Yeah, this is really not that important in the end.  No, but the funny thing is no one ever remembers, either.  No one ever said, you know what?  You did a show three years ago.  It was fucking great.  They were just kind of like, God, you guys blow.  I don't know what happened.  But there's a lot of guys building stuff with this show on all the time. 
[00:36:00]  Well, thanks to those guys.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you do this, you know, like the drive-by thing.  What are you saying?  What?  The thing he said, when you drive by the building.  Yeah.  Well, those guys aren't allowed in the buildings they built.  I've talked to those guys over the years.  But I'm saying, don't discredit yourself.  It's not like these guys drive by and go, I single-handedly constructed that Burger King.  And there it is.  It's like, they're telling 18 Mexican guys what to do.  You know what I mean?  Like, so, it's like, my point is, is don't discredit your thing, because it's the body 
[00:36:30]  of work as a whole versus the one component.  But what if the body of work was a fucking bridge?  What if you just worked on the fucking bridge?  Made something.  You're like, look at that bridge.  That was, that's it.  But your show is the bridge in the end, when you look back.  It was the show, not an episode.  It's the whole show.  It's a bridge of make-believe.  That's true.  It's fucking no one can cross it.  Shit.  You can't walk your son out in 20 years and go, I built that.  Nobody's ever laughed their balls off from driving over a bridge. 
[00:37:00]  How about that?  See?  See how positive that is?  Yeah, it's really nice.  I'm feeling better about myself.  Bridge building and Ron's show.  That's, all right.  I'm saying.  Do you have that feeling of a career, though?  No, this is just silly.  Yeah.  This is ridiculous.  You don't believe that.  It's silly in the end.  I refuse to believe you believe that.  I love what I do, but it's just dumb.  I don't even think Letterman fucking feels like, you know, I think he probably looks  back and goes, what the fuck?  No, what was it all? 
[00:37:30]  What did it all mean?  If you're any good, that's the truth, because you're always moving forward, and you don't  think what you've done is anything.  But you won't look back on this show when it's all said and done and go, we were one  of the fucking contenders.  Both of you guys sit in this room, two of the biggest radio shows that have ever existed  ever in history in the world.  You look back, and you go, we were in the top fucking five.  We were in the top five.  How about top five?  What kind of legacy is that? 
[00:38:00]  Top five.  Standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.  We were one of the top five.  Name the fifth astronaut that walked on the moon.  No, no, no.  But I'm not order.  Top five, Ron.  Top five.  Top five.  Top five.  Nice.  Mulligan was second.  Remember Mulligan?  Then you got Szynski.  Szynski was the third guy up.  Right?  Listen.  Four?  Who's four?  You got four?  I'm not.  Who was the fifth guy that ran an under four-minute mile? 
[00:38:30]  Hold on.  Sitting there with your grandson on your knee.  Right.  Under the Christmas tree.  That's not your mission.  There was a time.  No, I got it.  I was number four.  This is the point.  I'm not saying.  Who was the fifth best player in the NBA?  I'm not saying you guys were fourth.  Sometimes we were five.  Mostly five.  What the?  I'm not ordering the top five.  I'm saying sometimes we were up there.  Sometimes we fell to six, but not for long.  So you took the five biggest reissers of all time.  O&A, Ron Fez, Stern, Walter Winchell, and fucking Larry. 
[00:39:00]  And Bob and Tom.  All right.  Those were the fucking five.  Dick Clark.  Those were five.  Dick Clark, Casey Kasem.  Ronnie.  Bob and Tom.  Yeah, but I mean this kind of show.  I'm talking about like.  Bob and Tom.  Now it's getting vague.  They're fucking retarded huge.  I mean, I'm not saying, you know.  I'm just saying like if you talk about the five biggest morning Steve Harvey.  If that doesn't show you this, it doesn't mean shit.  Come on.  That's not his. 
[00:39:30]  Steve Harvey.  You see, it's getting vague.  This is not a bridge.  Right.  You're not looking at that bridge.  Tom is pushing you down further.  Yeah, he is.  Are you?  Yeah.  You motherfucker.  No.  What number you got us at?  Seventeen.  I'm saying that it's a vague conversation with your kid to say we were in the top 30.  You don't phrase it like that.  You think Hope's going to sit around with his kids and say that's when I came up with  what's in your pants.  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:40:00]  Do you understand my body of work?  I can't compete.  Do you understand I can't go to family functions ever?  You've got to be proud of the body of work.  Do you understand I have my head down a lot when I'm around family and my real friends?  You've got to be proud of the body of work.  You can't discredit it.  Tom, one day you're going to sit with your kid and you're going to say, we did a half  season of the marriage wrap.  And I'm proud of you.  Come on, B.  You've got to be proud of the work you did.  Joe's taking shots.  Oh, that was a joke. 
[00:40:30]  Hey, not all of us can have a YouTube video.  Not all of us.  Our follow, our counting, our views in single digits.  They're fucking, my point is, is you can't, you don't look back on any of this stuff and  go, oh, it's stunk and it was nothing.  No, it's cool.  It's fucking, you should be proud of it.  You got comedy CDs and specials and whatever.  You look back on those things, you go, these were fucking things I did.  I'm proud of them.  Yeah, that's.  It was a lot of work.  That's without saying, of course. 
[00:41:00]  But don't take it too seriously, I guess, is what Ronnie's saying.  Yeah, well, I mean, I think you should be proud.  It's not going to happen.  It's not going to happen.  I actually feel like I'm going to have a drink right now.  I just need to be thinking about it.  Yeah, it's got more depressed.  Well, I'm sorry.  No, you made a run at it, though.  I really do appreciate it.  I did.  You did.  Seriously, you did.  That's the first time I ever got trashed, tried to cheer somebody up.  I just fucking, I just saw Jay Thomas look by him.  Where you fucking go?  He doesn't like me.  Why would he?  Why are we taking our shots? 
[00:41:30]  I like Jay Thomas.  Hey, why would he?  I can do Jack Cooper.  No one likes you.  That's true.  I like Jay Thomas.  Sam, explain why Jay Thomas doesn't like us.  It's time for you to pipe in.  Because we took Ira from him.  You remember, you know, Ira, the old guy who comes in, does the weather.  I'm going to say yes.  Yeah, okay.  Ira has been amazing.  We got way more out of him than Jay ever did.  Within two appearances, by the way.  Jay had him on for years and did nothing with him.  He came on the O&A show. 
[00:42:00]  Talking about hookers and all sorts of shit.  Whip out his dick.  And then all of a sudden, Jay plays that game where he doesn't want his guys on our show.  Right.  Jay will not allow Ira to come on the Opie and Anthony show anymore.  So we gave him a good trashing over it.  Because he does a different kind of thing.  I guess.  Ira's got different talents, I suppose.  He probably deserved just a little abuse.  But, of course, we took it way too far like we've been known to do.  But see, here's the thing.  Jay knows that Christmas is coming up and he's got that Letterman appearance where he's  going to tell the fucking story all over again. 
[00:42:30]  Which one?  You guys don't even know this thing.  No.  He goes on Letterman and tells the same story for 20 years.  What?  He tells the Lone Ranger story.  Every Christmas.  On purpose?  Yeah.  Like fucking Dave invites him back just for that one day and then says, tell the Lone Ranger  story.  Come on.  It's a funny story, though.  Yeah.  It's a great story.  But he's been doing it for 20 straight years?  Like about that, yeah.  And what, is Letterman waiting to see if anyone has noticed?  No.  Letterman's like this.  He just enjoys it.  It's the tradition.  It's the Christmas tradition. 
[00:43:00]  How do I not know this?  And then they throw footballs to a Christmas tree.  You don't see you work in the mornings.  You don't know.  No, no, no.  It's not.  Thanks for helping me out.  I appreciate that.  I don't know why I don't know this one.  It's just tradition?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He loves it.  It's a funny story, man.  What is it about?  The Lone Ranger.  Oh.  Do you understand?  No, I'm not really interested.  I'd listen to Jay when I was coming up in the business, by the way.  Yeah.  Was he a radio guy back then?  Yeah, he was pretty. 
[00:43:30]  He's always been.  I didn't know that.  Top five.  Yeah.  I was in high school.  I was in high school.  He was one of the guys I'd listen to getting ready for school.  He was good.  I didn't even know that.  I knew him from Cheers, and I thought he was just an actor in a comic.  I didn't know he did radio.  No, he was on 99X, I want to say.  Wow.  That came out of nowhere.  I think 99X here in New York, way back in the day.  99X.  I listened to that.  And he was kind of doing an edgy, I thought, in my stupid teenage brain, like an edgy morning  zoo type show. 
[00:44:00]  And then I moved on with my taste, but at the time, I definitely listened to him.  I see.  Top six, definitely.  Top six?  Tom's just not going to let this go.  He's not going to let this go.  Top five.  Well, what do you want me to fucking say?  Top five is like...  If I would have said number one, then I got to fucking say who of you two is number one.  I'm not getting into that shit.  No, you don't have to.  No, no.  You did it perfect.  You said...  It was really nice.  You got the vague.  You said...  Nobody got their phone.  If you would have said one of the best radio shows ever, you two had some of the... 
[00:44:30]  Whatever.  But then you had to put a number on it.  I said that first, and you went like this.  Because then in our heads, we would have went, yeah, maybe we are one or two.  That's what I said first.  And then you say top five.  I'm like, fuck you.  I said top radio shows.  I couldn't even name five shows I even respect.  How about that?  He's trying to build you up by tearing you down.  And then he throws Bob and Tom in there.  And they do a good job, but it's the type of radio we laugh at. 
[00:45:00]  But I'm just doing...  That's good, then.  I'm just going by the numbers.  No, I laugh at it in a bad way, Ronnie.  It's that hacky shit that works for them.  They have a huge career, of course, but I don't...  Seriously, as morning zoos go, you guys are in like the top seven.  Yeah, I don't respect their show, though, at all.  They're nice guys.  It's a different brand of comedy, but whatever.  That's not the point.  They love you, huh, Joe?  They let you plug bananas.  When you go in there, that's off the air. 
[00:45:30]  Hey, get it?  When you go in there, do it.  That's all bananas in my asshole joke.  Here's the thing.  I said that first.  First I said top radio shows in the world, and you made the Opie face.  You made the, like...  You went like this.  You did the fucking Opie face.  And then I went, oh, I've got to qualify the statement.  That was me downplaying it.  And then I said top five, modesty.  Oh, please.  All right, we get it, Joe.  You know.  Bob and Tom will have you back.  Don't worry. 
[00:46:00]  Do you go into their studio all sad, too?  Or you just say that for us?  I've got to play the game with them.  Your fans are so mean.  I've got to play the game with them.  I'm just around joking, and you're very depressed.  He's good now, though.  Yeah, I want to be depressed.  How's the web series?  Good?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm very...  I think there's six?  Five.  Five or six.  There's six total.  Web series.  Woo.  For Warner Sound.  Oh.  Are you going to be a dick now because I made that half season joke? 
[00:46:30]  No, it's okay.  Look, if I didn't have a movie coming out with Michael Douglas, maybe it would hurt.  But I think that I'm totally cool with ribbing each other.  I didn't want to get into a credits battle.  Jesus.  No, it's a fucking dumb joke I made.  Yeah, no.  Thought it'd be funny.  Went over lukewarm.  What do you want from me?  I hear great things from you about the web series.  Tom really is a mean asshole.  That's why I love him.  No, I think it's great.  That's why I love him.  I think it's great. 
[00:47:00]  It's all out on this show.  I love it.  Listen, I'm trying...  The web series is good, though.  It is good.  I'm an aspiring writer-director, and the web has been a good place for me to start getting  my feet wet with that.  And after we did the movie, this was like another thing that I was able to do and make  some cash and...  What's the name of it?  ...put some stuff together.  It's called What Are We Waiting For?  Nice.  And it's...  You know, I'm really proud of it.  Does it have a theme or is it kind of random stuff?  Yeah, I play a schlubby, annoying music fanboy, and every episode he's trying to like... 
[00:47:30]  He's waiting online for a concert or trying to get tickets for a concert.  It's something music-related.  That's funny.  Because it's for Warner Brothers.  So...  It takes place in the 70s?  No.  No, no.  It takes place now.  Why do you ask?  Because it seems like that's what the music guys used to do in the 70s, like wait for  concerts.  He's...  Well, that's an interesting question.  He's...  His mindset is 70s, 80s, but he's living in the modern world.  Gotcha.  So like there's an episode where he sleeps out in front of a record store all night on  a Monday so he can be the first one through the door on Tuesday to get the new releases. 
[00:48:00]  And the guy that owns the record store is like, you can just go download music.  Like get out of here.  You know what I mean?  So there's some commentaries about the music culture and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And I had a lot of my friends do it, like Opie and Anthony and Jimmy.  Oh, you star in it?  And Burr.  I have a security guard in one of them.  Are you really?  Yeah.  There's a bunch of different guys in it.  I went all in.  It was fun.  I grew a shitty beard.  That's cool.  I didn't take my nap that day, so I looked a little ornery. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, method.  And I told Joe I was bothering him with a lot of text messages, what my character should  do and what he shouldn't do.  And I wanted to be on boxes the whole time, so I was taller than everybody.  Nice.  And Opie's got my favorite line in the whole series, out of every episode.  He's got my absolute fucking most favorite line that makes me laugh the hardest.  So it's...  Well, then shit, we should play it right here.  Right here, right now.  Yeah, can I hear it?  Yeah, can you hear it?  I mean, will it play on the air like that?  Well, which line is it?  About the passes?  There's a line where I'm all excited because we got these backstage passes. 
[00:49:00]  It's me and Burr, and we're really drunk.  And I'm really excited that we got these backstage passes to see Sheryl Crow.  And we're trying to get her to our dressing room, and Opie won't let us in because we're  too drunk.  Same goal for them.  How long are they each?  Three, four minutes.  Yeah, they're only four minutes each.  Keep going.  It's near the end.  I'll tell you where.  It's...  Can you pull it up on the...  How many did you do?  We did six total.  Wow.  Oh, it's right before that. 
[00:49:30]  You look funny.  Yeah, this is the big moment.  Yeah, this is...  I'm all excited.  All right around here is good enough.  No, no, you're going too far, Sam.  Right there, right there, right there, right there.  See how I muscled him out of the scene?  I'm fucking good, man.  You are good.  I'm fucking good at this shit.  You look good.  Yeah, right.  It doesn't look like you.  Here we go.  Sorry, you two are out of here.  What are you being such a dick for, man?  Why am I being such a dick?  I have to deal with this shit every night.  Come on, dude.  We got these passes, man.  Those passes? 
[00:50:00]  Every radio station gives those passes out to people to make them feel special.  Well, do you feel special?  I bet you do, because you're a freaking retard.  That's my favorite line.  Look how sad it's showing.  You sound like such a neighborhood bully when you say that.  When I saw that...  It's very real.  When I saw that in the script, I'm like, I don't have to act this part.  I was just like...  I'm not acting right there.  You're good.  Yeah, so that's basically the thing. 
[00:50:30]  We're annoyed.  There's one with me and Anthony.  We're waiting in line to see Phil Collins, and he keeps singing Against All Odds to the  people in line, and they're getting annoyed.  There's one where Jim Norton plays a scalper, and I'm trying to scalp tickets to see Cat Williams.  I really like that one.  Jimmy and you fighting was like, that was good.  That was really intense.  That was some real fighting.  Intense.  I was bleeding.  I believe it.  He caught me with his nail, and I was bleeding at one point.  That's when you know you're not a good actor, if you hurt the other people. 
[00:51:00]  Are you a music guy?  Huge.  Yeah.  Huge music guy, and...  These tastes are weird, though, Ronnie.  We've been over it.  I mean, even the bands he picked for his series are a little strange.  Well, I didn't want to...  Lindsey Buckingham, Sheryl Crow, Phil Collins, and then Metallica's thrown in there, which  was strange.  And what was the other one?  Cat Williams.  Oh, yeah.  And then one's just about iTunes.  But here's the thing.  Out of all those bands, Metallica's the only one that I listened to, but I didn't want 
[00:51:30]  this series to turn into like, is that Freedom Rock, man?  We'll turn it up.  I didn't want it to be like that, so I was like, one of the key things with that was  every band that this guy loved had to be something that was kind of like, didn't make sense.  Where you were like...  And I was like, if you go too far in that direction, then it's ironic and stupid.  Right.  If he's like all psyched about ABBA.  But I was like, it makes sense to me that a guy in his 30s that has this old school mindset  could be this revved up about seeing Lindsey Buckingham because he loves Fleetwood Mac. 
[00:52:00]  You know what I mean?  There was a sensibility to that.  Lindsey Buckingham came in one day and played and fucking sang.  He was fucking amazing.  On your show?  Oh, yeah.  He was amazing.  Yeah, he's great.  Yeah.  I mean, you couldn't even follow his fingers.  No kidding.  No one ever talks about what a great guitarist.  Yeah.  He's fucking great.  So it's, you know...  Is his solo stuff good?  Well, Holiday Road is...  I know Holiday Road.  I love Holiday Road, man.  But after that, I really don't know Lindsey Buckingham's solo stuff.  See, you're only going from the radio, though. 
[00:52:30]  I know.  It's sad.  Oh, no, I know.  You've got to go deep.  But I love the backstage shit, because how many times have you done that as a radio guy where you think...  But I was just talking about this the other day.  When I first started radio, they were like, we did this big thing, and Robert Plant was the headliner.  And they said, oh, come on back to meet him.  And there was like a hundred people there, and they were like, sit down.  Wow.  Like, I'm not fucking waiting for Robert Plant.  And then you learn, like, there's...  It's fucking crazy.  You learn there's levels of backstage passes.  And it's never fucking great back there. 
[00:53:00]  And you never get the good one.  It's never a big party.  You get in a room, like Ronnie said, you wait an hour, hour and a half, and a hundred other idiots.  And then, eventually, these guys will come out.  And the artist is working.  And they will give you a half a second, maybe.  Yeah, the only good backstage passes that you get are when you don't give a shit anymore.  Right.  When it's like you're going to see your friend.  You're like, who fucking cares?  One of my best experiences, and it's, you know, early on in the XM days, we were lucky enough, me and Jimmy, to go see Sting do that dumb loot shit. 
[00:53:30]  But it was like a hundred people.  And we begged and got our way in.  And he played that stupid loot.  And I think he played one fucking police song.  And then we...  On the loot?  Oh, it's horrific.  Oh, that's the worst.  She's doing Roxanne all fucking, like, Baroque era.  We wish it could be Baroque.  He doesn't even get...  That's too fucking recent for him.  He thought this loot shit was going to take off.  And we didn't.  Do you think he really did? 
[00:54:00]  Yes.  Like, this is the next thing, the loot?  Yes.  We did hours on this, so we don't have to redo it.  But it was like, what are you doing?  You're fucking Sting.  I get you want to do some different things, but you picked the loot.  He flew some guy in from some country you never heard of where the loot is really fucking...  Yeah, and then he introduces him that way.  Like, no one can play the loot like this.  I'm like, I guess.  He got the song, which one?  The original?  There's the original, and then there's the loot version of Message in a Bottle.  Which one do you want to hear?  Just a taste.  What do you want to hear?  I'd go with the original just to hear out that. 
[00:54:30]  Go with the original.  So Sting, who, you know...  Found him in the rainforest.  He's got a great voice.  Yeah, if you're fucking Robin Hood.  Fucking Jethro Tolto calls this pussy.  They're like, what is this shit?  This is indulgent.  Listen to the hook.  Oh, we just missed the hook?  That was the hook?  No, it's coming. 
[00:55:00]  All right, listen to the hook.  It's brutal.  To see, to hear, to touch, to kiss, to die.  To die.  Wow.  We sat through an hour and a half of that with people politely clapping after every song.  Because everyone in the room was like, what the fuck?  Time Warner?  Jazz at Lincoln Center.  Boy.  Jazz at Lincoln Center.  Jazz at Lincoln Center.  So then we were lucky to go backstage and get our picture with Sting. 
[00:55:30]  Literally 10 of us.  And I grew up a huge police fan.  Yeah.  This was a moment for me.  And I shook his hand.  He could care less.  He was a dick, to be honest with you.  But then my picture didn't come out because the flash didn't go off.  So I made the mistake of asking him for a second picture.  Oh, no.  The look he gave me, which I have, because other people were flashing.  He was like, he was giving me the look like, how dare you?  And I'm thinking to myself, it's not like there's a line of 200 fucking people here. 
[00:56:00]  I'm not asking you to pose a painting.  Where's this fucking picture?  There's 10 people here.  I'm sorry.  I didn't complain when you went into your second Luke song.  Yeah, thank you.  You know what?  I wish you were with me.  Because I would have said just that.  Really?  Jeez.  I should be the one complaining.  I was expecting something a little different.  You should thank me that I'm still here after the whole show.  You want to hear a message in the bottle with the look?  Yeah, sure.  Yeah.  This was the only song he did that anyone recognized.  Just to cast away. 
[00:56:30]  Thank you, Ron.  He got it.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  Finally.  Thank you.  Ron got it.  Because guess what?  When he was playing all that other stuff, you could hear a pin drop.  And then people were like, oh, fuck, yeah.  Thank you.  I love, too, how it just sounds like acoustic message in a bottle.  It doesn't have any of that fucking forest-y sound to it.  No, not at all.  I like the angle of it, though.  This is like a fucking, like if Seinfeld would just start doing, like, ye olde comedy. 
[00:57:00]  You know what I mean?  It's like, I've done everything I could do.  Now I'm taking it back.  200 years from now.  I mean, it's fucking hysterical.  I like experiencing new shit.  So in a way, it wasn't as bad as maybe I made it out to be on the radio.  Right.  Knowing that this guy could be singing some cool shit for us.  Hey, if he had been cool to you backstage, you would have talked a lot nicer about it.  He's like, how dare you?  I'm like, fuck, man.  The flash didn't go off.  I'm never going to meet you again. 
[00:57:30]  I'm sorry.  Right.  It's fucking, yeah.  And then all of his people have to sit there in that meeting that he calls to order where  he goes, guys, here's what's going on next.  I'm going to do a loot tour.  Right.  And they all have to just sit there and be like, that's a great idea, Sting.  Yeah, man.  We're with you.  Yeah.  I just wonder what goes through their heads.  They got to be bored with, you know, going to see Sting solo or The Police is amazing 
[00:58:00]  for us, right?  Yeah.  But to him, he's like, fuck, I'm bored out of my mind.  I've been doing this for 30 years.  I just want to do something different.  Yeah.  He lost me at 10 Summoner's Tales.  Like two albums before that, I was out.  What was the big hit on there?  Well, 10 Summoner's Tales was the one with like Fields of Gold and like-  That was a good album.  It's not, that's not a bad album.  I'm just saying, but two albums before that, he was already starting to get way to like  adult contemporary.  And like acoustic, but not like rock ballad or folk acoustic. 
[00:58:30]  Like there was that, this period piece music was already starting to creep in.  And I was like, I can't do this, man.  Like I'm not into it.  The one thing I liked about The Police was kind of the reggae, you know.  They lost me at Roxanne.  I was fucking, that's not done.  I'm out.  That's it.  No more.  What is this?  Where are these guys going?  I really liked the Eddie Murphy version better.  If I'm going to be totally honest.  There's one of the funniest posts I ever read online was somebody wrote on one of the social 
[00:59:00]  sites.  They wrote, there's no way in hell Sting is the same guy that was in The Police.  And it was like, yeah, you're absolutely fucking right.  That's what the other guys at The Police say, too.  Yeah, actually, Stuart Copeland's the one that wrote it.  Oh, is that right?  Who did we meet?  We met, I think, all of them, right?  Didn't Andy Summers come by?  Yeah, they both came by.  He did the walk over with us, I remember.  So did Stuart Copeland.  Stuart Copeland, and then finally Sting backstage at the Loose show.  Stuart Copeland's, that oyster thing he did with Claypool and Trey Anastasio was really 
[00:59:30]  fucking cool.  I feel like I'm in your web series.  Nobody?  No, I didn't follow that.  I have no idea what that is.  Les Claypool from Primus.  Of course.  Trey Anastasio from Fish.  Okay.  Who's the guitar player in Fish.  Of course.  And Stuart Copeland.  Right.  Power Trio.  Right.  They did a thing called Oysterhead a few years back.  Oh, yeah, that is right.  I forgot it was.  Oh, wait, he was in Oysterhead?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was really fucking cool. 
[01:00:00]  I mean, everything Les Claypool does sounds like Primus, or some variation of it.  He likes to slap that bass.  He likes to slap that bass.  Yeah.  But it was really good, but it was just cool because you're like, Jesus Christ, Stuart  Copeland is so much older.  It's like when they did them Crooked Vultures, and What's His Face from Zeppelin was playing  with Dave Grohl and Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age.  It's cool when those older guys go.  You know way more about music than I do.  I see why you made that series. 
[01:00:30]  I don't know these side projects.  Yeah, you get it, Tom.  That means you know it.  All those older guys can fucking play.  Every single one of them.  They came out of that era.  They can all fucking play.  I just like when they'll actually come around and do stuff with the younger guys.  And it's like, yeah, I can still play cool, edgy stuff if I want to.  You know what I mean?  Or I could go over here and do this or whatever.  You know, it's like, because a lot of these guys, they start going in that direction  where you're like, or the other direction, I mean, where you're like, what are you doing? 
[01:01:00]  Why are you fucking doing like these string renditions of your old hits?  So just bored.  Or whatever.  You know, it's like, why just because you're old does it mean like you can't fucking, did  you hear a, who's the guy from ELL?  What's his name?  Jeff Flynn.  Jeff Flynn's new album is fucking brilliant.  You're like, this guy is in his 60s.  And it's this fucking amazing album.  The way it's produced, everything about it is fucking incredible.  Yeah.  And no one will hear it, which is sad.  Donald Fagan was in here the other day. 
[01:01:30]  He's got a great fucking album.  Really?  Yeah.  Who's he from again?  Steely Dan.  I just love Steely Dan.  And did you?  Were you a big fan?  Yeah.  He's.  And he had a solo album back in the day too that did all right.  What was the song off that?  That was that whole.  Look up Donald Fagan back in the end.  It's the IGA fucking song.  He did that.  And he did.  There was one that got a lot of radio.  It was the name.  Yeah.  The old gimmick.  Steely Dan.  Wow.  No static at all. 
[01:02:00]  Well, you go see those guys.  They're all older.  And, you know, everybody in the fucking band is amazing.  Every player in the band.  I just saw Monday night.  I saw Rush at the Barclay Center.  Yeah, but I heard they like fucking spent so much time with that new album right off the bat.  Dude, their new album is one of their best albums ever.  I was fucking thrilled that they did that.  Yeah, people were trying to turn us on to it the other day.  I wasn't feeling it.  Well, if you don't like Rush.  The one song that they're pushing right now.  I don't know.  I was big into Rush growing up.  Tom Sawyer. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, Limelight.  Their new album sounds like.  Spirit of the radio.  It's very 70s Rush.  It's very like.  Treat it to me.  Permanent Waves Rush.  XYZ.  But.  YYZ.  Oh, did I say XYZ?  XXL.  XXL.  I loved XXL.  You kids with your XYZs.  I was doing good there, too.  You Jim Sawyers.  No, I heard a lot of good things about the Rush show.  I really did.  But one guy I was talking to down the hall said that he was frustrated.  He spent so much time on the new album.  It's like when Steve Miller came to my college and he was in his jazz phase. 
[01:03:00]  All these people.  Everyone was waiting for the classic Steve Miller band.  He didn't give anything.  He was like.  We'll get back to you in a second, but my point, Tom, we've talked about that a lot,  too.  Just tell us up front.  Right.  Let me know.  Before we buy the ticket and go in, let me know.  Steve Miller band, new shit tour.  Well, just let us know.  You'll get your fans coming.  Yeah.  Right.  It's.  I mean, look.  At the end of the day, whether you were a fan of the set list they picked or not, 
[01:03:30]  they.  55, 56.  However old they are.  They fucking ripped.  Because like Ron said, they know how to fucking play their instruments.  That's fucking believable.  Yeah.  Their new album, too, is heavy.  Rush?  Yeah.  It's fucking awesome.  It's better than their old stuff?  I'm not saying it's better than their old stuff, but it is right in line with the stuff  they were doing in the 70s.  We got a guy that wants to challenge you.  Bring Sal in here.  Great.  Bring Sal in.  That's a good one.  Can you get high on you?  Be no, ne, no, ne, no, ne, no, ne, no, ne, no, ne, no, ne, no, ne, no, ne, no,  ne, no, ne, no, ne, no, ne, no, ne, no, ne, no, ne, no, ne, no, ne, no. 
[01:04:00]  How do you top that?  If you just like.  A lot of people.  This is Sal.  Oh, Sal.  I thought it was you had a caller one at the challenge.  No, it's Sal.  He's our hipster, dude.  Hey, Sal.  Hi, guys.  Lives in Brooklyn.  We're making him.  Sal, have you heard the new Rush album?  I did, because I saw Rush.  He was told to shave the beard, by the way.  Yeah, because, Ron, we're going old school.  He's got to grow us a hipster mustache.  Oh, that's cool.  This kid could pull it off.  But, so he's growing the beard, so no one, you know, I want the awkward, just mustache 
[01:04:30]  growing.  I got to, like, see people.  I don't want to, like, look like an idiot with that.  You'd be good.  You're good now.  You'd be good now.  The new kids coming up, Ron, all entitled.  The new kids coming up.  All entitled.  Damn.  The old guys, they would just do it.  Eastside Dave never thought about how he looked.  He'd eat shit.  He did.  He did that.  He did eat shit, and this guy's worried about a fucking stupid mustache.  You think I worried about seeing people when I was growing out this monstrosity of a hairdo?  Right, that started out as a radio thing. 
[01:05:00]  Looks great.  Thank you, Ron.  So you think the new Rush album's awesome, Sal?  No, I think it's, I'm a huge Rush fan.  I've seen Rush, like, 30, 40 times.  Name your top five.  30, 40 times?  Name your top five Rush songs.  That's fucking too much, seriously.  Top five Rush songs.  Who do you think the top 10 radio shows in the world are?  I want to see what kind of Rush fan he is.  Name five.  Counterparts.  Bravado.  Bravado is one of your favorite Rush songs.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  Bravado.  Because he's going deep.  All right. 
[01:05:30]  He's been to 30 shows.  Keep going.  How many Rush shows have you been to?  I've only seen them once, but I've been listening to them for years.  Jesus Christ.  I don't even like them.  I got all the albums.  I'm a huge fucking fan.  I'll go to it.  What else is on the top five?  I like Dreamline, too.  Dreamline's a great tune.  Dreamline.  I actually like the Test for Echo record.  Test for Echo is a really good song.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Test for Echo is a decent record.  Yeah.  I think next to Hold Your Fire, it's the worst Rush album.  You don't like Hold Your Fire? 
[01:06:00]  You think...  It's got its moments, but you think that...  Tell me why you don't like the new album.  I have no idea what's going on.  It has its moments, but like that shit, like the other night when Lifeson was playing the  fucking piano.  This is like when guys talk about Monty Python and you don't know what the album is.  Yes!  I was not in on that.  I made believe I loved it.  Yeah, but the new...  But wait a minute.  Why don't you like the new album, though?  The new album is great.  Oh, yeah.  The Nights at Ten Me.  It has like...  Headlong Flight's a pretty good song.  Headline Flight is fucking...  It's amazing.  Can we...  Can you play a little bit of Headlong Flight?  Oh, God, no.  We've already lost the audience. 
[01:06:30]  Headlong Flight, you fucking go.  Right.  All right.  I think that the new Rush album is very reminiscent of the later 70s Rush stuff.  Anytime someone's as reminiscent talking about music, you know they're full of shit.  Can I ask Sal something?  You're what, 22?  22.  And you've seen Rush 30 times.  Yeah, my dad's a hardcore fan, too.  That's amazing.  Are you exaggerating that number? 
[01:07:00]  No, I'm not.  I usually see him like five to six times per tour.  Wow.  So what?  You fly out to places?  No, it's just like...  They usually do like two...  Philly and all that.  Yeah, like New York.  They used to do Jones Beach a lot.  Here's what's funny, though.  Holy fuck.  It's hardcore.  My friend, Dan, who got me into Rush, he's...  I've argued him for years on certain Rush albums, and he's the one that like eventually  got me to at least listen to Hold Your Fire and stuff like that, where he's like,  they're great albums, man.  And I was always like, fuck those 80s albums.  You know?  It's amazing how something... 
[01:07:30]  I like them now.  It would be that important.  But he didn't seem that excited about the new album either.  And he's like, it's good, man.  It's good.  It's not better than Snakes and Arrows.  And I'm like, it kills Snakes and Arrows.  Yeah, and I wasn't a big fan of Snakes and Arrows either.  Oh, man.  And if you want to warm up, Sal, that's your fucking problem.  Yeah.  You don't like anything new.  I hate everything new.  Yeah, it takes you a year or two.  So you don't like the new album.  And you've seen it three times.  But Alex Lifeson was playing fucking piano the other night.  But that was just one song.  Is the new album well-received?  Do people like the new album?  Generally?  When it came out and I tweeted about it, Rush fans were tweeting me like crazy, going, 
[01:08:00]  this is fucking amazing.  Well, if Rush fans like it, Sal doesn't.  Of course Sal doesn't, because he's a hipster.  All right.  We're going to bring up that one.  He's not supposed to like it.  I see what's going on here.  If he was a hipster, he wouldn't be at a Rush show, though.  True.  I don't know.  Young people don't like Rush.  Ironically, it was.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what he's doing.  Sam, you're a bit of a hipster yourself.  How?  No.  No.  Stop.  Look at your haircut, the sweatshirt, the t-shirt.  He's hip-hop.  That's not hipster.  He's hip-hop.  You don't think Sam looks like a hipster at all? 
[01:08:30]  No.  He's hip-hop.  Where's his handlebar mustache?  Where's his beard?  You don't think Sam just got plucked out of an action figure store in Brooklyn somewhere?  I mean, come on.  He's a wrestling fan.  He fucking collects those boys.  Maybe my life has turned into the hipster.  I've been collecting action figures since I was.  But you've got a bit of a hipster vibe.  I don't see it.  Do I?  We don't see it, Joe.  Yes.  I don't see it.  I live in the suburbs.  You're starting trouble.  No, no, no.  I'm not picking on you.  I'm just saying.  What's an overrated Rush song for you, Sam?  An overrated Rush?  Well, of course, I'm going to say, you know, probably like, I don't know, Spirit of Radio. 
[01:09:00]  I mean, it's a good song.  But he picks the big thing on.  But it's like, no, but of course it is, dude.  I've heard that song.  Some people like it.  Yeah, well, he's a big time.  But Joe, Joe, be honest.  When they...  Because Rush the other night...  Rush plays like a close to three hour long show.  I'm still talking about Rush.  And the other day...  I need complete control of this place.  They played nine songs from the new album.  I loved it.  And the crowd was just standing there completely still.  Look, here's where I loved it. 
[01:09:30]  Here's where I loved it.  Because I've heard enough live stuff of the older stuff and whatever.  It's great.  Don't you, by the way, don't you love the technique of Opie?  They can talk about it forever.  He calls you in to talk about this, and then he trashes you for talking about it.  Don't give away my secrets.  That's fucked up.  No, it's good.  That's all I got is my secrets.  Opie exposed.  And how this works.  You want to hear our Getty Lee story?  Yeah. 
[01:10:00]  Please don't tell me he was a dick.  He was with Sting with that loot.  We had him in.  Please don't tell me he was a dick.  He was great.  He loved us.  Oh, good.  What?  Well, that was the day we also had one of those big, huge tit monsters in.  And we suggested that, I don't know, maybe she should fucking put her tits around Getty Lee's head.  And what did he say?  Well, you know, he went with it because he didn't want to look like an idiot.  And we never heard from him again.  Oh.  Yeah, they're not really like...  We used to do something called, what was it? 
[01:10:30]  Tit headphones.  These girls would come with really big tits and then you'd put them around.  Top five.  That's why he's in the top five.  Is that why top five, not top three?  He's the man who brought tit headphones into his fucking thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See?  See?  See?  Ronnie's right.  Ronnie's right.  How do I explain that to my kid?  You know, and I take it back.  That one, no tit headphones into his fucking thing.  What's your business?  Don't me and Anthony brought him in.  Big, warm fucking tits. 
[01:11:00]  Put this show...  Covering up your ears.  Put it behind you.  Panama Canal.  Big deal.  I brought out tit headphones.  Sam, let's bring back tit headphones, please.  Did they go with the Boo-Bow Lantern?  It's Halloween.  Oh, we did Boo-Bow Lantern, too.  Sure.  Yeah.  I think it's time to bring that back.  I remember everybody...  Rush had good t-shirts, though.  Rush did?  They had cool t-shirts.  Why are you bringing up Rush again?  I don't want to talk about this anymore.  I do.  I think Sal's right, though.  I mean, he can't...  He's too deep. 
[01:11:30]  30 shows.  Dude, I think if you hear a little bit...  He knows a little too much.  I think if you hear a little bit of a song from a new album, you might go, okay.  We tried this last week.  Yeah, but I don't...  But I can't think of a level that Sal is.  Play a little bit of Headlong Flight, and you'll just see what I mean.  Like, these guys are still playing their fucking balls.  All right, let's hear it.  Skip to the hook, too.  The intro.  Ope didn't like the intro last time.  Oh, that's the song you played last time?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, well, then don't play that song.  You know what you should play?  I wish they would fucking open with that.  All right, let's go to break with this.  Fuck it.  We got Tom Papa, Joe DeRosa, and the great Ronnie B. 
[01:12:00]  We got Tom Papa, Joe DeRosa, and the great Ronnie B.  We got Tom Papa, Joe DeRosa, and the great Ronnie B. 
[01:12:30]  We got Tom Papa, Joe DeRosa, and the great Ronnie B.  Music makes your morning mood  Up on your way

[01:17:00]  Fat, uneducated slobs are calling it a comedic masterpiece.  Did you hear about the lookalike competition in China?  Yeah, everybody won.  Jim Crow is rolling in his grave with laughter.  I hate the fucking shit like you do. 
[01:17:30]  Move over, Larry the Cable Guy.  There's a new bland, predictable redneck in town.  All right, what's Mary short for?  She's got no legs.  Where are we going now?  It's Billy the Bassman and his all-new CD.  Where are we going?  Available now at truck stops and cracker barrels everywhere.  The kids are running wild because school's out, but cool's in.  No reason to get antsy. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, where are you getting them in your pouncy?  It's Valley Gym.  Oh, my God.  California is trend-setting again with all the coolest slang and wackiest situations.  That is so grody.  Hey, Jim.  Did you, like, hear that Sheila was totes making out with Brad?  Oh, make me want to barf.  Tag along as the crew lives, laughs, but also learns.  Uh, like, oh, my God.  Have you heard what's going on in Uganda?

You're, uh, grody, yes. 
[01:19:00]  Gag me with a spoon, mommy.  It's Valley Gym, coming very soon to a theater near you.  Well, how am I supposed to talk?  Like, with my butt or something?  3-6-M.  The Opie Realtor Show.  Class.  Let's set the room here.  To my right here is Ronnie B.  He's absolutely in my top five, Joe DeRosa.  Top five.  Yeah, mine too.  Top five in radio history right there. 
[01:19:30]  Well, you know what, to be honest, Joe is the one who brought it up, though.  I wouldn't even be thought of today as a top five guy.  And we're ordering top five jackets for our whole team.  Top fivers.  The way Ron was talking, it made me feel bad.  It made me sad that he seemed so down on himself.  I just don't understand.  Ron down on himself.  Ron.  No, I just don't know what we do as work.  But I didn't understand until this commercial just how sensitive that you are.  Yeah.  And you really are a sensitive guy. 
[01:20:00]  He's fragile.  A little bit sensitive.  Well, we were going to move on from Rush, but you said something as soon as we went to  break and Ronnie looks right at me and I'm like, of course.  Right.  Well, you said, meaning the look Ronnie gave me, like, we're going to bring this to the  air.  You cried during Spirit of Radio the other night?  The other night.  Not when he was 15.  Why don't you bring this up when we're talking about Rush?  We didn't get to it yet.  That song came on and he was in tears.  What, you thought in the second hour of us discussing Rush that we'd finally get to it? 
[01:20:30]  How about we want to move on from Rush?  Let me explain why I didn't bring it up.  I've cried at so many fucking concerts.  It wasn't really that big of a deal to me.  This is great.  Well, I want to hear all the concerts.  I cry.  I'll dwell.  I mean, I'm not fucking crying.  We understand.  I well up from excitement.  It makes me, music hits me.  You're just a nice guy.  Hits me right in my soul.  He's very sensitive.  So when they play Spirit of Radio.  Tom Papa rules.  Tom Papa has a dark side. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, he does.  It comes out on the show a little bit, but not when he's doing all these other projects.  Tom is a fucking asshole.  No, I mean it.  You are.  You're very sensitive.  All right.  Anyway, go ahead.  Tom is a fucking calculator.  You're like, Tom's the nice guy.  He sits there with his hands full.  Nah, you know, you're a pussy.  And you're like, what the fuck, Tom?  I did not say that.  I cried too.  But you're very, you are sensitive.  Yeah, I know.  Listen, I, yeah, I, I, I, I, I tear up from excitement.  So when they played, listen, I was also fucking hammered.  Okay.  No, but why do you, but you say you get very emotional at shows in general. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  Like what shows?  Like what shows?  Yeah.  Let us, let us, let us steer the, we'll steer you in some good directions here, Joe.  Okay.  What shows?  Uh, I, I got, uh, you know what show I got really fucking worked up at was, uh, Danzig.  Like when he did Mother, do you know that song?  Yes.  I didn't cry, but I got, I was going batshit.  I didn't cry, but I was going, Mother's a great song, but why? 
[01:22:00]  That's not a song you should be crying over.  I didn't cry to it.  Maybe it's because it's like, he's got his own stuff going on all.  You know, like it reminded him of something.  His mom.  Yeah.  Well, I know your mom went through some tough things and, uh, there were, no, and everything  worked out nice.  Let's not go that direction.  Wait, your mom was, no, I'm not.  No, I'm not.  Joe, I swear to you, I'm not.  I know you're not.  That was a tough time for you.  And we're all happy that worked out.  Thank you.  I could be a human being.  Thank you.  But is that the reason?  No, I didn't. 
[01:22:30]  I keep saying, I didn't cry during Mother.  I just got, I was like, like I go crazy.  It shows sometimes if it hits me in the right emotional way, it'll make me tear up though.  And that's what happened with spirit of radio.  But when you go crazy, what happens when you're not crying?  Like are you dancing?  Are you, I do this at a show.  I'm literally fucking like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm air drumming.  I'm screaming.  Are people, are people around you backing off?  Like you find yourself in a circle?  Uh, no, no.  Everybody around you is doing that too. 
[01:23:00]  I go where those people go in the crowd.  You're deep, you're like in the, in the mob.  I went to see this band into another.  They were, uh, like post hardcore band from the nineties that I was really into.  They have been broken up for 17 years.  They just got back together.  So we went to their New York reunion show.  I fucking was in the mosh pit the entire time.  I almost crowd surfed and staged.  I got, I was so into it.  Wow.  I got the shit kicked out of me.  You don't have the body for that. 
[01:23:30]  He loves his music.  That's why I did stage dive.  I was like, I'll fuck this up and hurt myself.  You'll, you'll break a hip.  But I mean, they play this.  Why spirit of radio?  Let's keep you on track.  That just got me, it just got me, it just brought me back.  It just brought me back to like when I was in college.  Yeah, exactly.  And when it was doing the, all this machinery making modern music can still be open hearted.  I'm tearing up right now.  I'm tearing up right now.  It's pretty amazing.  I feel like a pussy.  I felt like Geddy Lee was back in here without the fucking, uh. 
[01:24:00]  I love how he loves music though.  Yeah, no, he fucking love it.  Joe's one of those guys.  He knows some shit.  Do you tear up at shows?  No.  No.  I did once.  What?  Once.  Wait, I did two once.  I lost my wallet.  And I was fucking screaming.  Everyone out of the pit.  I got $40 in there.  But mine was easy.  If you weren't crying, uh, at this show, then you're, you were just an asshole.  It was after 9-11, U2, Madison Square Garden.  They did one.  And then they showed the names. 
[01:24:30]  That's cheating.  That's cheating.  That's cheating.  Scrolling.  And when the names just kept coming and coming and coming, you're like, holy fuck.  Everyone knew how many people we lost.  But when you see it, as names just scrolling as they're singing this song, the fucking  place lost it.  And you were crying because you were like, let's get to the next song.  This is going to go on forever.  Yeah, because I'm a huge U2 fan.  Come on, Tom.  The tears did flow, though.  I was like, fuck.  How do you hold that emotion back?  That made me a little, I just got like, teary chills just hearing that.  That sounds beautiful. 
[01:25:00]  That sounds like a beautiful experience.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  It was really nice.  Seriously.  Beautiful.  Let's all make fun of 9-11, guys.  Or 9-11.  Everything's a big joke on the O&A program.  I'm still...  There has been enough time, though, hasn't there?  Yeah.  I'm still thinking...  We can't talk about it a little bit.  I'm still in that position...  It was yesterday.  I'm in that position where everything about 9-11 isn't beautiful yet.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  It's not beautiful yet.  I'm not saying 9-11 was beautiful.  I'm saying the tribute was beautiful. 
[01:25:30]  Maybe in another 10, 20 years, maybe I'll start seeing the beauty of 9-11, Joe.  The position...  I mean, the tribute was beautiful.  That's what I mean.  It was a nice move.  Of course.  Right.  I don't know if I would call it beautiful.  You know, it was like the spring after 9-11, they did this show downtown, and it was  like Bowie and Wycliffe and all these people, and everybody was down, and like, you're  not that far away, you know?  And people were fucking crying and dancing and going crazy.  And that's what I thought.  Music is better than any other fucking artist. 
[01:26:00]  Right.  It's the greatest.  You will never be able to...  You wouldn't be able to show up at any other thing and just start, like, giving in.  Yeah.  It's the only universal language.  It's the...  Literally the only universal language.  You watch American bands...  It's true, though.  You watch an American band go to a country that doesn't speak English and just fucking  kill live, and it's like, doesn't matter whether they understand what they're saying  or not.  Maybe they do, maybe they don't.  It's just...  Maybe we should play We Are the Dinosaurs.  That's music.  That's music. 
[01:26:30]  That's art.  That's kids' stuff.  That's an amazing song.  It's an amazing kids' song.  Made me cry.  I've heard about that.  Yeah.  Tom, have you ever cried at a show?  The Wiggles?  I was like, what's happened in my life?  Why am I at the Wiggles as a grown man?  I'm going to give you guys the defining thing of see where you are.  I'll be able to judge you from this with a lifeboat game, where you just say there's  only so much room on a lifeboat.  Well, Joe would have to go. 
[01:27:00]  Three seats.  No.  We're not doing it with us.  Oh, oh, oh.  It's a discussion.  I was just...  You threw me off.  No.  You threw me off.  Right away.  Go ahead.  I don't want to...  He got leaves the lifeboat.  Look, it's because it's already a depressing thing.  We're in a lifeboat hoping to be saved, and I'm sure you're going to fucking really  bring us down.  I'm going to jump into the conclusion, sir.  I think this is like a fun little game.  Oh, I'm sorry, Ronnie.  Go ahead.  I thought it was us and a lifeboat.  We're going to get rid of one of us.  But I got your number now up.  Now I know where you're coming from.  Go ahead, Ronnie.  I was coming to Sam.  Sam.  How dare you.  All right, here you go. 
[01:27:30]  Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Jimi Page, and Eddie Van Halen.  You got three fucking seats.  And this is up on the iBank.  But the...  I like the iBank, by the way.  We should be promoting that.  We should be promoting the shit out of it.  But you got Clapton, Hendrix, Jimi Page, Eddie Van Halen.  That's easy.  Can I start?  Can I start?  Well, the easy answer would be Eddie Van Halen.  Everyone knows that.  Why?  I disagree.  Yeah, Eddie gets booted off immediately, right?  Well, because look at the other guys.  Yeah.  You know what?  Eddie's going to be annoying.  Clapton, Hendrix. 
[01:28:00]  Who was the other one?  Clapton, Hendrix, Jimi Page, Eddie Van Halen.  Yeah, to me, the easy choice would be just Eddie Van Halen.  So easy.  You know who goes in the water first?  No, not Eddie Van Halen.  You throw that fucking cocksucker thief, Jimmy Page, into the fucking water.  Wow.  For stealing all those people's music and becoming a fucking icon off of the hard work of other  people that he didn't fucking credit.  Like who?  Who do you know?  Everybody.  What do you know about this?  That fucking scumbag.  Him and Plant stole fucking music from black blues artists.  They stole it from their former bandmates. 
[01:28:30]  Black blues artists.  I mean, what guy in rock and roll?  That's redundant.  Yeah, exactly.  They all did that.  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  They stepped right over them to get into the Kilmore.  Hold on a second.  I'm not saying they took influence from these guys.  I'm saying they took fucking songs that they didn't write and put them out as Zeppelin  songs and said, this is a Led Zeppelin song that was written by us when it wasn't.  That's a fucking scumbag.  There's shit all over the internet.  Stairway to Heaven was ripped off.  Well, Stairway to Heaven.  You guys have talked about this a million times. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, I know.  The Stairway to Heaven, Spirits, what, Natural Way was it?  And let me say, play me the, what are you, it's, it's, oh, now he is getting the discs.  Do you not know about any of this?  Seriously?  I don't.  I really don't.  It's fucking shameless.  Because I know he was, before he was with Led Zeppelin, he was playing a lot of, he was  playing for everybody.  He was in the Yardbirds, he stole songs from the Yardbirds that he wrote with the other  members and just made them Zeppelin songs.  But Joe, I think back then it was kind of the wild, wild west.  You know, people were ripping off everybody. 
[01:29:30]  They fucking know.  I'm not saying it was right, but it seemed like it was the thing people were doing and everyone  knew they were doing it.  You know what?  I'd still rather hang out with him than Eddie Van Halen.  You know what?  Sinatraa never wrote one note of his fucking music, of his own music, every fucking show  at the beginning of every song.  This is a song by Van Heusen and whoever.  He gave fucking credit to everybody.  And if there was somebody that you could make the argument didn't have to, it was fucking  Frank Sinatra.  And that guy did it.  They were fucking scumbags.  So who did Jimi Hendrix, Ron, is he right?  Nobody.  Well, the thing is about Jimmy Page and Led Zeppelin, but if you even go back to the 
[01:30:00]  Chicago blues guys, a lot of them do the same licks.  Those licks just come up over and over and over.  Yeah, they're old school blues licks.  Oh yeah, but what you're saying is credit, if you're going to do it, some of those guys  should have got paid.  Well, there's that, but there's also, and I'm upset that I'm not knowledgeable enough  to recall the specific songs, but there were specific songs.  It wasn't just licks. 
[01:30:30]  There was like songs on early Led Zeppelin albums where it's like, no, this is an old  blues song and they didn't give the credit to the guy that wrote it.  Yeah, Zeppelin really liked Willie Dixon and Howling Wolf.  Okay.  Nice.  But so did everybody.  Yeah, they kind of...  Howl, howl, howl, howl, howl, howl, howl, howl, howl, howl, howl, howl, howl, howl, howl.  Here's...  Ron, here's this to me.  Hold on, I got one for you.  Okay, okay.  All right, even though we've done this a million times, but it's all right.  Here's Willie Dixon and Zeppelin, Whole Lotta Love. 
[01:31:00]  Baby, way down inside, woman, you need love.  Way down inside, honey, you need it.  Zeppelin made it better.  I like Willie Dixon, actually.  I like some of the old blues guys.  Look on the album, did they say they wrote it?  Yes.  Did they say they wrote that song?  Yes.  That's the problem.  I think that was the problem.  Can you play the Willie Dixon again?  Well, there's another one.  I Can't Quit You, Baby, we know that song, right? 
[01:31:30]  Willie Dixon.  Oh, I can't quit you, baby.  Oh, man, I've got to put you down for a little while.  Oh, I can't quit you, baby.  So I'm going to put you down for a while.  All right, it might be a little similar. 
[01:32:00]  But I, you know, I have to think, they actually did this without, and then put their names  on the fucking album.  I have no credit anywhere, too.  I believe so.  And then I think in later albums, they did start kind of like doing that slash Willie Dixon  type shit.  Yeah, because they got called on it.  I believe.  The guy, the guy.  I don't have the, I don't have the Stairway to Heaven one, Iraq.  We used to play that one, too.  Ron, there was a guy that compiled all these, and he started going on radio shows.  He blew the fucking lid off of it, so to speak, like deep throat. 
[01:32:30]  And he fucking, and all of a sudden, they started getting called on it.  And this was, to me, proof of their guilt.  When they cornered, they interviewed Paige and Plant separately about this, and they would  say, Paige, what the fuck?  And Paige would go, well, Plant was doing it, too.  Ask him.  And then they'd interview Plant.  Plant would go, well, Paige was doing it, too.  Ask him.  Like, that's what you do when you're guilty.  You know what I mean?  You passed the fucking buck.  What was the car crash?  What was it?  Ronnie had it. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, he hit the thing.  But honestly, it was perfect.  It really was perfect.  Wow, fuck, Ron.  I didn't realize how good you were.  Holy fuck.  Doesn't even have to see.  Doesn't even have to see the buck.  Top five.  Definitely top five.  Wow.  Wow.  This is a no-look pass.  I think we've got to move him up to top three now, Jeff.  That's amazing.  Well, why were you getting rid of Eddie Van Halen?  I don't know.  I think the other guys are just...  A little more classic.  Yeah. 
[01:33:30]  They hold up a little more, don't they?  Do you think?  Yeah, I think so.  Eddie Van Halen knows how to play the fucking guitar.  Who's your guy?  I'm getting rid of fucking Paige only because...  See, I'm a huge Zeppelin fan, so that's tough.  Oh, then you like Thieves.  I fucking saw him.  Huh?  Then you like Thieves.  Yeah, I guess so.  Why don't you go pat the guy on the back that just robbed the fucking grocery store down  the street?  I mean, the Stones did the same thing, didn't they?  No, they actually credit everybody.  They do?  Not only, but Keith Richards will give a fucking history lesson to white people. 
[01:34:00]  Like, when they came over, they were like, here's your music.  Here's the people you're not even paying attention to.  They were very good about that.  Well, I gotta do this, and then we could see who we would kick out of the boat there.  Spirit, oh, the song was called Taurus.  Okay.  Spirit had a song called Taurus in 1968.  Listen to this.  Just a piece.  Wait till you hear this.  I know.  I've heard this one.  Oh, you know this one?  I love it.  I don't know this.  I love it.  All right.  Well, we'll look at you for your reaction.  Okay? 
[01:34:30]  Let's see if this is close to stairway to heaven from Zeppelin.  And that came out in 71, three years later.  This is Spirit, Taurus.  If you didn't know better, you would swear that's Stairway to Heaven live somewhere. 
[01:35:00]  You would think it was Michael Bolton's version of Stairway to Heaven.  That's kind of fucked up.  That's kind of weird.  It was their biggest song.  Hmm.  So how did everybody miss it at the time?  That's a really good question.  They probably didn't.  It just, there wasn't YouTube and Twitter.  But how did Spirit sit there and go, holy fuck, they're making millions off this song,  and they obviously ripped off our riff?  They probably got a fucking shit contract and weren't able to make any fucking power moves 
[01:35:30]  based on it, you know what I mean?  They basically said, what are we going to do?  They used to fuck those guys left and right.  Dude, I heard a story once about Muddy Waters, who's like one of the most famous blues musicians  ever.  Love Muddy Waters.  Somebody told me a story about when they went into, I forget what record label used  to put all those guys out.  They went, this was in the 60s.  Yeah.  No.  That's the president's dog.  Yes.  Fuck.  What year is this?  Yeah.  They went to his label.  He was painting the lobby. 
[01:36:00]  And he was painting, that's how bad his fucking contract was.  He had to paint the fucking lobby of this place.  He was keeping the roof on top of it.  And he had to paint the lobby because he didn't have any fucking money.  When the guy told you that story, did he cry?  I was jerking off.  I was already weeping.  What other concerts have you cried at?  I'm having a hard time remembering right now.  And it's not because I'm exaggerating. 
[01:36:30]  I'm just having a hard time remembering.  I cried a lot of movies.  I could rattle those off a little more quickly.  I cry every time I watch Malcolm X at the end when he gets killed.  I cry every time I watch The Untouchables when they kill Sean Connery.  Like, cry, cry?  You get tears in your eyes.  I don't fucking...  I'm not uncontrollably weeping.  I cried...  Oh, here's a real queefy one.  Here you go, guys.  Queefy.  Yeah, because I haven't learned my lesson with giving my friends information on this show.  Please share. 
[01:37:00]  Fucking Love Actually fucking kills me.  And Grumpy Old Men.  Every Christmas I watch those two movies.  Woo!  Woo!  Every Christmas?  What part of Love Actually?  Just at the fucking...  When they're all fucking at...  When they have their moments at the end at the airport.  And when the...  You know what part really gets me?  When the rock guy goes to his manager and tells him, like,  I love you, dude.  You're my best friend in the fucking world.  You're the only idiot I want to be with on...  Like, that's fucking really touching to me. 
[01:37:30]  Grumpy Old Men when Mathel goes to the hospital  after Jack Lemmon has the heart attack.  And they're like, are you friend or family?  And he doesn't know how to answer it because they've been fighting for 30 years.  Oh, it's fucking beautiful, man.  Do we have the scene that Joe cries at?  Love Actually.  It's not going to make me cry now.  I've got to sit through the whole movie.  It's beautiful, though.  Look.  It is.  They're embracing.  Yeah.  Sorry, guys.  Ah, football.  Sorry.  Man Cave.  Yeah.  Man Cave.  Yeah, let's get to...  No emotions.  Um... 
[01:38:00]  What about Planes, Trains, and Automobiles?  Oh, my God.  If you don't cry at that movie, you're not a...  When he brings John Candy home?  If you don't cry...  I mean this with all my heart.  If you don't cry at the end of Planes, Trains, and Automobiles,  you are not a fucking human being.  Sure.  I'm an easy target.  Oh, my God.  How brutal.  How brilliant was John Candy?  Phenomenal in that.  Holy fuck.  Phenomenal in that.  You know, they tried to cut that scene out of the movie.  No.  The scene Tom just said,  yeah, you want to take shots at me?  That's fine.  I'm an easy target.  They wanted to cut it out of the movie.  They said it was too fucking sad. 
[01:38:30]  It's like...  It's amazing.  That's the whole movie!  When you realize his wife's dead...  Oh.  At the end...  Who didn't see that coming, right?  Just as much.  Oh, my God.  She's been dead for 10 years.  Still talks to her.  He's sitting in the fucking...  Yeah.  Train station by himself.  Now I'm with you, Joe.  See how this works on this show?  He's basically homeless.  It was easy to make fun, but...  Oh, brutal.  He's just on the road all the time with his rings,  his shower curtain rings.  Oh, it's fucking brutal.  You know what?  You know what?  I like me.  But great.  My wife likes me.  My customers like me. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, my God, man.  What a loser, right?  I'm the genuine article.  What a loser.  Did he say genuine article or the real deal?  Something like that?  I'm the real article.  I'm the real article.  Real article?  Something like that.  Do you have that scene?  I'm the real article.  Oh, that is brutal.  Candy had a way of doing that, man.  Really fucking funny, but some real shit in that guy.  That is the harshest...  That is the harshest...  When you're that fat, that is the harshest...  What was it?  Sometimes that's all you need. 
[01:39:30]  When you're that fat, it's easy.  It really is.  Here it is, right?  You have a lot of pain.  You've got to play the whole scene, though, because you've got to get the flip-flop.  Let's play the whole movie.  Yeah, why not?  What else are we doing?  It's Friday.  We're just fucking around, man.  I'm just getting to 10 o'clock.  This is the harshest emotional flip-flop I've ever seen in a fucking movie, where they lead  you one way.  I don't know where they're going to pick up with this.  You know, everything is not an anecdote.  You have to discriminate.  You choose things that are funny or mildly amusing or interesting. 
[01:40:00]  You're a miracle.  Your stories have none of that.  You're not even amusing accidentally.  Honey, I'd like you to meet Del Griffith.  He's got some amusing anecdotes for you.  Oh, and here's a gun so you can blow your brains out.  You'll thank me for it.  I could tolerate any insurance seminar.  For days, I could sit there and listen to them go on and on with a big smile on my face.  They'd say, how can you stand it? 
[01:40:30]  And I'd say, because I've been with Del Griffith.  I can take anything.  You know what they'd say?  There's a guy that's a, I know what you mean.  Shower curtain ring guy.  It's like going on a date with a chatty cat and dog.  Oh, my God.  I expect you to have a little string on your chest, you know, that I pull out and have  to snap back.  Except I wouldn't pull it out and snap it back.  You would.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  And by the way, you know, when you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea. 
[01:41:00]  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  Look, Candy's giving it.  What?  Come on.  They cut it.  Why would they cut it?  On the wings of love, up in the back.  No, you go right to the next one.  It's all Steve Martin for me, for that whole thing.  No, no.  Oh, here it is.  Go back.  Go right ahead of it.  It makes you feel any better.  Go back.  Go back.  Go back.  Yeah, we finished.  You want to hurt me?  Go right ahead of it.  It makes you feel any better.  I'm an easy target. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, you're right.  I talk too much.  They didn't need the music.  I also listen too much.  The music was good.  80s.  I could be a cold-hearted cynic like you.  But I don't like to hurt people's feelings.  Well, you think what you want about me.  I'm not changing.  I like, I like me.  No confidence.  My wife likes me.  My customers like me.  Because I'm the real article. 
[01:42:00]  What you see is what you get.  That music, that's John Hughes, though, right?  Yeah.  Doesn't make it timeless.  Yeah, he didn't need the music there.  That scene was so fucking powerful.  That is.  And then he goes to bed.  I got to say, though, be quiet that you're a pussy.  Then he goes to bed, they're sharing the bed, and he's kind of looking over, hoping that,  you know, he got the point, and now they're going to be friends. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, dude, it's fucking brutal.  It's a brutal movie.  I love it.  But what about the fucking funniest thing ever is when he wakes up and he's fucking driving,  and they're going, you're going the wrong way.  And he's like, you don't even know which way we're going.  Right.  It's so fucking great.  That's great.  Yeah, ha!  The drinking thing.  Right, right.  It's like he's fucking drinking.  That's so funny.  I love when they're in the diner after the kid robs their room.  Yeah.  And they're going through their wallets, they have no money left, and John Giddy goes, 
[01:43:00]  I think we were robbed.  And Steve Ayer goes, you think so?  That fucking retard voice.  Ah, fuck.  Thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving.  Yeah.  That and Home Alone, it's a perfect night.  An Afghan and some mint tea.  Home Alone is a Christmas movie.  Yeah, but it launches into the Christmas season.  There you go.  Yeah.  No, it's true.  From one to the other.  Yeah, that's the hottest.  You watch that after Thanksgiving.  After you eat. 
[01:43:30]  Save it for Christmas.  You save it for Christmas, really?  Yeah, you've got to save the Christmas movies for Christmas.  Did you watch all of them or just the first one?  Save it for Christmas.  Christmas already started.  Target's running commercials already.  This is the season.  Yeah, we're in it.  I don't play by those rules.  The only Christmas movies for me are about the birth of our Lord.  Anything else?  There you go, Ron.  I thought it's secular.  I thought it's secular.  Right.  I totally get that.  Did you see the trailers for A Christmas Story Part 2 that just came out?  Oh, no. 
[01:44:00]  Part 2.  They made a sequel, which makes no sense, because the guy that wrote The Christmas Story is dead.  Right.  He was great.  Yeah, it was Gene Shepard, right?  Amazing.  They made a sequel.  He's a top fiver.  He's a radio guy.  Yeah, he's a radio guy.  I'd give him top three.  But Gene Shepard's dead.  They made a sequel.  Hold on.  Here it is.  It's the most beloved Christmas story of all time.  I didn't even know this was happening.  In this holiday season, Ralphie is back.  Ralphie?  Ralphie?  Ralphie? 
[01:44:30]  Now he's a bigger kid with an even bigger wish.  Holy jeez.  A Christmas Story 2.  The official sequel.  The timeless tradition continues with all your favorite characters.  Randy.  Zerg's minions are everywhere.  I just can't trust that son of a...  Ralphie's best pals, Flick and Schwartz.  Ho-ho, here we go.  I'll fight.  Mom.  It's safe now.  I heard you sniffle.  And the old man.  It's a clinker!  That's it! 
[01:45:00]  Frickin' snuggish, sucker!  In an all-new heartwarming movie.  Honestly, it looks like behind the wheel just once.  Ah!  To brighten your holiday.  Oh, my God.  It looks holiday season.  It looks terrible, but it's...  Can I get a slinky?  A slinky?  You waited two hours in line to ask for a bed spring.  The fun is just beginning.  8-piece will hire anybody on Christmas.  We'll work our butts off 12 hours a day. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, I'm so sorry.  Here, here.  And family is a gift.  You should be honored your father lets you go with him.  Ralphie didn't get to go fishing until he was well past puberty.  Ralphie has all the luck.  That keeps on giving.  This is for you from Aunt Clara.  That is too adorable for words.  I can think of a few.  A Christmas Story 2, the official sequel. 
[01:46:00]  Isn't it beautiful?  It's risen from the grave.  This is the greatest Christmas in history.  Own it on Blu-ray combo pack or download to own.  DVD 2 pack also available.  Wait, it's not going to be in theaters?  Straight to DVD.  Yeah.  I thought that would be in theaters.  The look of it is pretty...  It looks like...  On the money, though.  Like, it's shot...  It looks exactly the same as the first one.  Right, guys?  Why would they do that?  Money. 
[01:46:30]  Money, obviously.  You're right.  Money.  Nothing matters but fuck.  Yeah, we think they have actual respect for art.  Art.  Seeks.  Of course not.  Remember...  Wow, that looks horrendous.  That's like as bad of a sequel as, like...  Remember Arthur 2?  Yeah, of course.  That made me cry.  I cry at that every time.  Because what?  He was sober through it, right?  Yeah.  Sober and...  Yeah, why would you do that?  Yeah, and they're like, fuck, we shouldn't have killed off John Gielgud.  Let's bring him back as a ghost.  Right.  Fucking movie stinks.  Most sequels aren't that great.  I cry at that.  I thought Godfather 2. 
[01:47:00]  Godfather 2 was great.  Yeah, that was a good one.  I yelled out, this blows.  The theater.  What are you doing?  You fucking ruined it.  We used to love that movie.  Did you ever see The Simpsons where they're walking out of Empire Strikes Back, and there's  like this huge line, and Homer's like, yeah, right.  Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father.  I'm supposed to buy that.  All right, we'll do another break.  So you would get rid of Paige, huh? 
[01:47:30]  I'd get rid of Hendrix.  You weren't a Zeppelin guy?  No.  No?  I didn't like all the fucking mythology fucking things.  Well, yeah, it got a little weird.  Yeah.  You know, the fucking snow Vikings and all that stuff.  Snow Vikings.  I come from the land of the ice, and no, you don't.  That got embarrassing.  But they tried.  They were living in castles and stuff.  Yeah, it's embarrassing.  So they tried, at least.  Fucking androgynous, homoerotic guy.  I'm a Viking.  It doesn't make no sense. 
[01:48:00]  And I always, you know, it just sounded like a chick singer to me.  I think there's something a little embarrassing about Led Zeppelin.  And now that I know that they're just fucking thieves, and just gutting fucking homeless black  guys who wrote music, no, I'll never like them.  That's it.  Fucking yeah.  Ronnie's a big Stones fan.  Although, Eddie Van Halen getting killed in this poll.  I think because of you.  I think you threw Eddie under the bus.  The man who reinvented the guitar, according to Frank Zappa. 
[01:48:30]  Really?  Oh, yeah?  What did Frank Zappa know?  Are you fucking- Zappa was a hat, too.  He stole from everybody, didn't he?  He got a little wordy with his songs.  I did.  To a point.  I didn't go too deep with Frank Zappa.  You didn't?  No.  You really dug into those Tesla albums, though, didn't you?  No.  Queensryche.  No.  Who else were you to hope?  I played all that shit on the radio, but no. 
[01:49:00]  Zappa.  I was a YouTube fan.  Zappa was like-  Doing the police early on.  Zeppelin.  I was into Sabbath for a while, and then I moved more into Zeppelin.  Had a friend that was obsessed with Jethro Tull.  Didn't you feel like you were supposed to like Zappa?  Yeah.  Yeah, like-  Like you were supposed to like Monty Python?  Yeah.  You weren't cool if you didn't.  Well, you know, some people just don't get it, you know?  Yeah.  We're not going to get everything.  What's there to get?  It's just over a lot of people's heads. 
[01:49:30]  A lot of people's heads.  So we're not as good as Jethro Tull.  That's basically what I'm saying.  Who's better, Rush or Zappa?  Zappa.  Excuse me.  Zappa?  I mean, he was a genius, obviously.  I just, I don't know.  I just didn't-  It's high concept stuff.  You got to get it.  What?  How would you sum it up?  Yeah, you're really not selling Zappa.  He's playing Zappa to a kid who's never heard of it.  Right.  In all honesty, it's hard because there's so many different genres and phases that he goes  through.  It's really hard to go. 
[01:50:00]  He was this.  I would just say that he really was a composer in the truest sense because he did write everything  from symphonic orchestral music to garage band rock.  Like, he composed every type of music there was to compose, or many of them.  But if I was going to tell somebody to get into them and they said, what's the best stuff?  I'd say, like, the jazz fusion stuff he did in the 70s is, like, the coolest, most mind-blowing stuff.  Jazz is a little rough.  It's not jazz.  Jazz fusion rock, which is way more like Chick Corea and, like, electric- 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, all that stuff's rough.  Piano type stuff.  A lot of lute.  Rough what?  You hate it?  I don't hate it, but I don't, like, search it out.  Search what out?  It's not on your iPod.  Or what, man?  I don't know much about jazz.  I could hear stuff and go, all right, I could maybe sit through this, but-  But jazz and jazz fusion are two very different things.  Like, I like Miles Davis.  Or Cole Porter.  Okay, but-  Jazz and jazz fusion rock are, like, worlds apart.  Yeah, I understand that. 
[01:51:00]  I like the classics.  I never got into jazz fusion at all.  Not at all.  Thelonious Monkey-like.  Old-school jazz, I could hear it.  I could go into a-  Don't you like jazz, you know, flavor rock?  You like traffic and-  I like traffic.  Yeah, well, then, didn't you like jazz fusion rock?  No, I understand there were some elements of jazz in some of the bands we listened to.  Why wasn't Zappa popular?  But, oh, there's a difference between jazz and jazz fusion rock.  I understand all that.  Look how many guys-  No, I'm not even getting mad.  That whole, because it's a Long Island, they have this little thing of, oh, everyone thinks we're into Queensryche and that's it. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, exactly.  I'm uneducated as far as jazz goes.  I don't know much about it.  I got turned on Kind of Blue from Miles Davis.  Love that album.  But I couldn't tell you why.  That's a jazz album.  Yeah, I know.  I said old-school jazz.  We're talking about jazz fusion rock.  Oh, I know, and I told you I didn't get that at all.  Coltrane.  Or the big jazz fusion bands.  Miles Davis, Kind of Blue.  I'm fucking wrong.  I'm joking.  Kind of Blue.  I'm joking. 
[01:52:00]  I know.  Jazz fusion.  Jazz fusion with Traffic.  Chick Corea's electric band is a good one.  When did you say Traffic was jazz fusion?  Yeah, there's-  There's jazz elements.  Those guys-  Aren't they rock?  Those guys love it, yeah.  Fuck.  You don't even know.  No, no.  Chick Corea.  Chick Corea's electric band?  Yes, totally.  Oh, like the Mahanivishtu Orchestra.  Oh, we're shitting on Sting for playing his lute.  Yeah, we should go.  No, John McLaughlin, one of the greatest guitar players in rock. 
[01:52:30]  I just don't know anything about this stuff.  Wait, I'm just-  You asked me about jazz fusion bands.  I'm telling you the names of a few jazz fusion bands.  Here's the thing.  This hits you where, because you grew up in the suburbs, that whole thing fucks with you,  right?  Yeah, of course.  You're like, oh, we lost the Islanders.  Of course, now I want to take a part of the music we grew up listening to.  No, I loved that the Islanders moved to Brooklyn.  Did you really?  Yeah, because they were going to fucking leave.  I mean, it was looking like Kansas City.  So I'm at least happy they're staying in the area.  Do you hate that they kept the name Islanders, though? 
[01:53:00]  No, no.  Brooklyn Islanders?  No, because if you know, like, Los Angeles Lakers, that's based on when they were in Minnesota.  That's tradition.  They try to keep the name as they move them around.  That's old school.  Like Chick Corea.  Yeah.  There's great stuff.  There's not many lakes in Los Angeles.  Who was better, Zappa or Chick Corea?  Zappa.  Zappa?  Yeah.  Who's better, the Stones or Zappa?  Zappa.  Oh, my God.  No, really?  Zappa's better than everybody to me.  Well, I'm not, you know, because he loves Zappa. 
[01:53:30]  Right.  He loves them.  He's one of your guys, right?  He's my favorite musician ever.  All right.  He loves them.  He touches his heart.  Can you sing along to the songs?  Some of them.  Some of them are not.  Don't eat that yellow snow.  You just fucking whistle that on the way home.  Genius.  Dynamo hum.  You're like, oh.  But he purposely went out.  And the musicians in that band were phenomenal.  Yeah.  Everybody he played with was great.  Yeah, they're amazing. 
[01:54:00]  I like Zappa so much that I go see Zappa tribute bands because it's that impressive to watch musicians  be able to pull the music off.  It's like going to see somebody play, to me, it's like going to see somebody play like  Beethoven's Fifth or whatever.  You just go to hear the music and see somebody actually play it accurately and play it well.  You're an intellect.  I would never go see another tribute band.  He's like an intellect or something.  He is.  Does Zappa make you cry?  Is there any parts of Zappa that make you cry?  Oh, that is a concert that I got a little weepy at.  I went to see Dweezil Zappa do Zappa play Zappa. 
[01:54:30]  And they piped.  And they had this guy Ray White, who was one of the Zappa alumni with them, which I was  very excited.  I didn't know he'd be there.  And it was cool to see him.  So I was already worked up.  And then they opened with one of my favorite songs by him.  And then in the chorus, like when it hits the really big chorus, they pumped Zappa's  vocals through the monitors.  And that got me teary.  I got so excited.  I got teary.  Nice.  But it's not crying like sad.  So Dweezil was too...  It's emotional.  Dweezil was too lazy to play that part?  No, he played it.  What a hack.  What a hack. 
[01:55:00]  He played it.  Was he entitled?  He said, fuck this.  I'll have my dad sing this part.  Oh, he was kind of giving a little gift to the fans.  Oh.  You know what I mean?  Would you keep him in the lifeboat?  Who, Dweezil?  Yeah.  No, maybe we could do like Rock and Roll Sons.  That would be a great thing.  Rock and Roll Sons.  Who stays in the lifeboat?  We did an hour or two on our show.  Siblings of big, huge rock stars.  Holy fuck.  The drop off is brutal.  We listened to Phil Collins' son. 
[01:55:30]  Who else?  Iraq, do you remember?  Phil Collins' son.  Phil Collins' son had a little something going on.  Oh, fuck.  I can't remember now.  Bob Dylan's.  Yeah, Dylan.  Bob Dylan's son, I guess.  You did McCartney.  We did McCartney's son, thank you.  Johnny Cash.  We did Jim Croce's son.  There was a bunch of them.  You did Sean Lennon, right?  Sean Lennon.  Vanilla Ice.  You don't like Sean Lennon?  You know, I saw him at the Central Park concert stage, and I was a little frustrated. 
[01:56:00]  It was too artsy.  I'm like, God damn, he sounds so much like his fucking father.  People don't realize Sean Lennon sounds a lot like John Lennon.  Exactly like him.  But his influence is so much his mom, it's almost, to me, a shame that his father wasn't  around a little longer to show him a few things.  No, no, no.  Do you?  Yeah.  For real?  Yeah, I think she's amazing.  In what way?  She's the one John Lennon picked.  That's all I ever need to know.  I'm like, I'll fucking listen.  Let's do this.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't know much about her. 
[01:56:30]  I can't, like, front.  Do you really like her?  The Plastogono band was fucking great.  Yeah, and she was in that band.  Is that good stuff?  I always thought it would just be annoying to hear it, because she goes, ah!  Yeah, I love that.  I just love it.  She's just fucking losing it, and then, like, a couple years later, Punk comes out.  You know what I mean?  Like, it literally was like early Punk.  It was literally like, I'm going to grab a fucking...  Were they influenced by Yoko Ono?  What do you say?  Yeah.  Wow.  You've seen Rock and Roll Circus, right?  Yeah.  Where she ruins the big fucking jam session? 
[01:57:00]  That's hilarious.  You've seen that, right?  Yeah.  You've got to be honest, she ruins it.  You've got some big names on that stage, and then she's the vocalist screaming.  But, see, here's the thing.  It really depends on what you think of as ruin it.  Well, who was on that stage?  Let's break this down.  You had Lennon.  Yeah.  You had Hendrix.  Chuck Berry?  No.  I'm talking about the clip with Chuck Berry and Lennon on stage, and she starts singing  in the middle of the song, and Chuck Berry goes... 
[01:57:30]  No, really?  Yeah, you never saw that?  No, that's funny.  It's fucking hilarious.  Burr showed it to me.  I was laughing.  I've got to say that.  I guess it's one of those that either love her or hate her, but there's...  Well, I think it's...  I do think that...  Oh, wait.  Here it is.  Chuck Berry, John Lennon, and Yoko Ono.  Memphis, Tennessee.  Yeah, it takes a minute.  They're playing for a little while before she jumps in.  All right, moving along.  Bringing your girl along.  Yeah, keep going until she starts moving toward that mic.  How cool is that?  Yes, Chuck Berry and John Lennon. 
[01:58:00]  Help me information to get in touch with my maroon.  I am for the rich.  Just a half a mile.  Come on.  Do that again.  Chuck Berry's eyes.  Do that again.  Start singing.  They're popping out of his head.  Holy.  Show her singing.  His eyes are popping out of his head. 
[01:58:30]  He would definitely shit on her if he had the chance.  Oh, fucking anyone.  Have you guys ever seen Chuck Berry?  No.  Live?  Yeah.  No.  It's the most fucking amazing thing because he'll just play with local bands, right?  Right.  Like local kids.  Well, he needs some money.  They have to pay him cash up front, and he walks on, and he's got his fucking guitar with  him, and he's just meeting them in front of me.  He takes the guitar out of the case, he plugs in, starts to fucking play, and 30 minutes 
[01:59:00]  later, he fucking puts the guitar in the cage, and he walks off to the city, everybody, and  heads to his car.  So he can hire him.  He's got a fucking bag of cash, and he's carrying it.  You can hire him for a half hour, obviously.  And the weird thing is, you know that if you just, you know, some promoter put the thought  to it, you could, instead of him getting fucking 30 grand for the night, he could do a fucking  $40 million tour.  Right.  But he's like, I don't trust those fucking guys.  Wow. 
[01:59:30]  No kidding.  He's still playing?  Yeah, he still plays in St. Louis.  How old is he?  He's like, in his 80s or something, you know?  230.  And he can still, like...  It's the same exact, you know, chords.  But I mean, it doesn't...  You're not like going, oh, this is an old man still trying to play.  You're like, no, this fucker can still play.  No, because the whole thing sounds like no one gives a fuck.  It's like he showed up, he doesn't know the musicians he's playing with.  It's an old blues guy.  And you're just yelling out, hey, there he is. 
[02:00:00]  That's kind of cool.  An old black guy with a guitar.  Why does he wear the yacht hat, too?  I don't know.  He's a sailor.  He loves the sea.  That might be.  That might go against his roots.  He loves the sea.  Might go against his roots, huh?  You could do a 30 for 30 with him, Tom, where you just yell stuff.  Y'all done those talking heads.  Joe Montana wasn't going to give up.  Chuck Berry.  Yeah, hardcore.  Well, I mean...  He looks better than Keith Richards.  Well, Keith, you read his book? 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  A little wordy, huh?  It was great.  I read it on vacation.  It was five, six hundred pages, wasn't it?  I flew through it, which I don't normally do on a big book.  I read the entire thing.  I enjoyed it.  I just wish he had maybe an editor.  Would have helped that book a little bit.  He did repeat himself a couple times.  A little bit.  They played last night in Paris.  Yeah.  And?  And, you know...  50 years.  Twitter loves it.  Their new single is fucking great.  I think it's phenomenal.  I love it, man.  We played it on the show a couple weeks ago.  I liked it a lot.  I haven't heard it.  It fucking sounds like old Stones. 
[02:01:00]  It sounds like 70s Stones.  It sounds like...  Like Zappa?  No, not so much Zappa, but...  Tom, you're just such a fucking cunt.  What?  You get very unusual...  You're saying it's great.  It's fucking prods constantly.  You say it's great.  He just keeps...  He just...  You said it was great.  Like top five?  Like Zappa?  What's your top five bands?  Top five bands.  That's a good one for jazz.  I know one is Faith No More, which is strange to me.  Bands?  Bad religion.  Hold on a second.  Faith No More? 
[02:01:30]  I love Faith No More.  Yeah, it's one of his big...  Let me ask this.  You want my top five favorite overall musical whatever or top five bands?  Bands.  Bands.  Because I don't count Zappa as a band.  I count him as a solo artist.  Do you mean that plus bands?  The mother of invention.  He had a nice band behind him.  But it was...  You know what I'm saying?  I have to...  I break it...  You want...  I'm serious.  Way to ruin the game.  Frank Zappa and Bad Religion are my two favorites.  Okay?  He hit it again. 
[02:02:00]  Faith No More.  Top five?  Oh, yeah.  Easily.  His is weird.  Easily.  Spoon?  Spoon?  Yep.  Are you going to get a spoon tattoo?  No.  No, I wouldn't.  No.  But they are my top five favorite bands ever.  I don't even know.  I don't know if I know a song by Spoon.  I don't know if I heard it.  They're not...  I mean, they're popular in an independent circuit sense, but they're not like, you know...  All right.  They're not way out there.  One more. 
[02:02:30]  Rush.  I'll put Rush in there.  And then I got to pick at least one rap group, because I listened to a lot of rap growing  up.  I'll say Cool Keith.  This is my favorite rap.  This is the weirdest top five I've ever heard.  That's why I asked for it.  It really is amazing.  He's not going in one direction.  His heart's open to music.  Yeah.  It's so bad for him.  And Sinatra, too.  I really...  I'm a big, big Sinatra fan.  Yeah.  Big, big, big, big.  Frank Jr. or just Frank?  Frank Jr.  Frank Jr.'s better.  I mean, it didn't really get going until Frank Jr. 
[02:03:00]  stepped in.  He didn't have much of a relationship with his father.  You know that, right?  Spoon.  Well, he conducted his orchestra in the final year.  Near the end, Frank finally threw him a bone.  And his dad...  Once he was kidnapped, he lost the love for him.  It's legendary.  He didn't really acknowledge his son for the longest fucking time.  Until he was kidnapped.  Yeah.  And then at the end, he gave him some work.  I saw him at Radio City.  That was the first concert I ever saw.  Who?  Frank?  Frank Sinatra.  At Radio City Music Hall.  Don Rickles opened up.  It was the first concert I ever saw.  I was in high school.  Mine was Southside Johnny.  Yours is way better. 
[02:03:30]  No, they're both about the same.  That's cool.  He did a 30-minute version of having a party.  Someone didn't have a lot of songs back then.  Trying to help spread the rumor that Springsteen might show.  Because it happened once, right?  I was like...  Because there was one time...  Some talk about Springsteen showing.  There's a buzz.  There's a buzz in the park.  It's Bruce.  I think that's Bruce's car.  I saw Bruce's security guard.  I'm telling you.  He's here.  What's their song?  I've heard their name a million times. 
[02:04:00]  Southside Johnny.  I don't know.  We're having a party.  We're having a party.  Everybody's coming.  Oh, I think I know this story.  Singing on the radio.  It's no...  Spoon.  Iraq, you got the one Spoon song I know.  What's the big Spoon song?  You'll know this one.  This is our prom song.  I told you I can't make it slip.  You wouldn't know this song.  I turned my camera on.  I turned my camera on. 
[02:04:30]  Spoon is the one you'd know.  And I like that.  Yeah, it's great.  They're fucking great.  I do like that song.  No, I don't know this here.  How many albums does Spoon have?  Like six.  Well, maybe I do know this.  They've been around since the early 90s.  They've got a big radio play.  Don't you ever.  Now, but I turned my camera on.  It's the big one.  They sound like cake a little bit, huh?  Yeah, but they're...  I loved cake.  Cake's cool, but like...  Cake was good.  Brit Daniel, the singer in Spoon, he actually sings.  Like, he doesn't just go,  and she walked into the front door, 
[02:05:00]  and I ate a fucking can of peaches.  You know, like...  I'm not shitting on cake,  but the guy kind of talks his way through things.  Cake was good.  That's what he's shrugging about over there.  I like cake.  I'm not saying they're bad.  I think he's a good singer.  I think if you put cake head-to-head with Spoon.  Do you think he just talks to stuff?  At times, I guess.  I want a short jacket.  Cake's got a little...  He's just talking.  Yeah, there's a little novelty element to cake,  I would say.  No, it's Frank Sinatra, right?  While Frank Sinatra sings Stormy Weather and... 
[02:05:30]  Men Without Hats.  Men Without Hats.  Spiders and Flies, I think it is.  Men Without Hats is in your top five.  I like that song.  Yeah.  That's definitely in my lifeboat.  I don't know.  Yeah, this one.  With the Italian leather fucking couch or whatever.  This is one of my favorite songs by Cake.  I think...  Let's see who sings.  Head-to-head Cake Spoon.  You gotta give it the cake, right?  Yeah.  Spoon takes cake.  Can't eat the cake without a spoon. 
[02:06:00]  Let's get to the hook here.  Love this song.  He's talking.  A fleetly glimmering radio station.  A fleetly glimmering radio station.  Here's Frank Sinatra.  While Frank Sinatra sings Stormy Weather.  What's the name of the song?  And the spiders get along together.  I'm singing.  Cobwebs fall on an old skipping record.  Yeah, all right.  I love that thing.  You can figure it out.  So you got a Zappa tattoo. 
[02:06:30]  Would you get another tattoo of one of those?  Bad Religion is your number one.  I'm getting a Bad Religion tattoo.  You are?  Yeah.  I'm getting a Bad Religion tattoo.  Definitely.  Where?  I'm a heavy kind of cat, you know?  You are pretty heavy, Joey.  What's your favorite Bad Religion song?  Ever?  Fuck, that's a tough one.  Probably Stranger Than Fiction.  Stranger Than Fiction.  Yeah, I was thinking of that myself.  Were you here?  I don't know.  What's that song? 
[02:07:00]  Oh, I know this.  I have heard this.  Best song ever?  Not ever, but it's probably my favorite favorite.  Oh, they're like The Clash.  Sure, they're punk there.  They're very melodic.  They do a lot of harmonies.  All right, we lost Ron, so we're going to take a break and get the show back on track.  I'm loving it.  He's hitting his phone.  We got to take a break here.  You want to play the new Stones in a break?  Yeah.  Just fucking around, right? 
[02:07:30]  I'd love to hear that.  Can we do a mix of that and Spoon?  Can we mash it up?  We are not going to talk about music when we get back.  I promise you people.  We went a little too far with the music thing, I think.  What?  Football when we get back.  Let's do football.  Yeah, football.  We got a big weekend coming up.  I'm going to go lay down.  You don't like football?  Jesus, Joe.  I got nothing.  I don't watch sports at all.  At all.  I know.  I'm not saying anything.  You would cry so much at those games.  I probably would.  You would.  You know, I get into the games if I want. 
[02:08:00]  I can't get into football a little bit, like when it gets into crunch time, if it's a close  game.  But it's just too much stopping and starting.  I don't enjoy it.  It's actually too much now, anyway.  There's too much fucking football.  There's a game every fucking night now, if you want to keep up.  You do fantasy football?  No, I just quit the other day.  I gave my team away.  You just quit?  Yeah.  Good for you.  I gave my team to Chris Stanley because Fez fucking purposely lost to me.  What?  Yeah.  What?  He didn't set his lineup properly? 
[02:08:30]  No, he fucking didn't set his lineup properly.  Why?  Because I guess he was afraid to win.  Ah.  Because I would bust his balls about it.  Let's talk about how exhausting that is after the break.  No, I don't want to do that.  I don't make him cry.  My partner cries all the time.  No, I know.  I know.  He's a crier.  I know.  He's a nice guy, though.  He's wonderful.  You and Fez, we get along very well, Joe.  He's a wonderful guy.  Yeah, you guys.  Maybe I could be his first.  You could watch Love Actually together.  You guys could have a, well, you know.  You could do worse.  You could do worse.  You would be great.  He could do better is really what you should be saying. 
[02:09:00]  We should have a Love Actually party.  I ought to.  Invite both of them.  I want to do something where we bring Tom Green in.  Yeah, Tom Green's outside studio.  He's going to join us next.  You guys promoting anything?  Tom Papa?  Yeah, November 13th, I'm doing a live Come to Papa show at the Village.  Underground here in New York.  If you go to the Comedy Cellar, you can get in for free.  Nice.  Jim Norton will be on the show, and a couple other comedians are doing.  It's kind of like an old-style radio show. 
[02:09:30]  Very cool.  Nice.  What are we waiting for up now?  YouTube.com slash TheWarnerSound.  And Levity Live, the weekend of November 9th.  Please come out.  What are we waiting for?  And Weez loved you, by the way.  I love Weez.  He's my man.  I love Weez.  The greatest.  He's my mentor.  The greatest.  So I'll be at Levity Live.  But Levity Live's in West Nyack.  That's not the Weez Club.  No, I know, but I forgot to mention that.  He's the greatest.  He loved you up there in Rochester.  Fucking greatest, man.  We had a blast up there. 
[02:10:00]  Weez from Spoon?  From Spoon?  Weez got me out of Woodstock 99.  Are you promoting anything wrong?  Yeah, I'll be doing the Ron and Fez show at 11.  He's sick, because he could take the day off, because he did this, but he refuses.  And then TheEyeBang.com.  He will not do that to the people.  It's great.  You're going from this to your show?  Yeah.  Wow.  TheEyeBang.com.  I really like your show.  TheEyeBang.com.  I really do.  I've listened to it for a long time.  You should do a show.  Always invite it.  Well, I kind of saw it in the top six until now, but now that it's top five, I think 
[02:10:30]  I'd love to come by.  You only do the top five shows, right?  Only top five shows.  TheEyeBang.com.  You really should check that out.  It's a great little site.  EyeBang.  It's growing, too, huh?  Oh, going crazy.  Nice.  EyeBang.  Spoon.  TheEyeBang.com.  All right, we'll do some new Stones going into break here.  What the hell?  Love Actually.  Check this out.  It sounds old school.  Absolutely.  What's the name of this?  Doom and Gloom?  Doom and Gloom.  I heard they stole this from Zeppelin. 
[02:11:00]  I heard they stole this from Zeppelin.  Settin' in the dirt.  Settin' in the dirt.  See the color hurt.  When all I hear is doom and gloom. 
[02:11:30]  And all is darkness in my way.  Through the light, your face I see.  Baby, take a chance.  Baby, take a chance.  Baby, won't you dance with me?  We lost all the treasure in our overseas war. 
[02:12:00]  Just goes to show you don't get what to pay for.  Burn to the rich and your wife got to pour.  Put the feet up on the couch and lock all the doors.  Hear the noise.  Hear the funky noise.  Hear the funky noise.  Hear the funky noise.  It's the tightening of the screws.  Feelin' kind of hurt.  Settin' in the dirt.  All I hear is doom and gloom. 
[02:12:30]  The windows drums go boom, boom, boom.  And through the night, your face I see.  Baby, take a chance.  Baby, won't you dance with me?  Yeah.  Baby, won't you dance with me?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:13:00]  I tried to see for a while, but there's nothin' in the sun.  There's kids out pickin' at the garbage dump.  I'm runnin' out of water, so I better climb the pond.  I'm tryin' to stay sober, but I end up drunk.  Whippin' eatin' dirt, livin' on the side of the road. 
[02:13:30]  There's some food for thought, gotta make your hair explode.  I'm feelin' kind of hurt, yeah.  But all I hear is doom and gloom.  And all this darkness in my ring. 
[02:14:00]  Feelin' at night, your face I see.  Baby, come on.  Baby, won't you dance with me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Baby, won't you dance with me?  I'm feelin' kind of hurt.  Baby, won't you dance with me? 
[02:14:30]  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  Dance with me.  I'm feelin' in the dirt.  Baby, won't you dance with me?  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  If you want to destroy my sweater. 
[02:15:00]  Hold this bed.  All right.  Jesus, Joe.  What?  I'm sitting here.  You're radio gold.  Because I'm sitting here like, what direction can we go in next?  And then you just say something.  And then I'm like, all right, that's a half hour.  There's a reason I...  But first, let me go around the room.  We got the great Ron Bennington, who's going to be doing his own show today with Fez.  Ron and Fez at 11 on this channel.  You got Joe DeRosa.  You got Tom Papa.  And now joining the discussion is Tom Green, who's playing Carolines all weekend long.  Thanks for having me back. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  After yesterday.  No problem, Tom.  We got a huge storm that's hitting New York.  They're calling it Frankenstorm?  Franken...  Frankenstorm.  Frankenstorm.  Okay.  And right before we popped the mics, Joe's like, is this thing going to be really bad?  I'm like, yeah, it's going to be pretty bad.  He goes, well, how do you prepare for something like this?  He's one of those guys.  And he said, I live alone.  And you live alone.  What could possibly happen?  Let's break this down.  Where do you live exactly?  In Gramercy.  Oh, my God.  The epicenter. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, that's kind of...  That's where...  That's perfect.  That's kind of where it's hitting, Joe.  Good God.  George Clooney's on a boat in there right now.  But, Joe, are you one of those guys...  He has no idea.  Are you one of those guys, you got to go to the supermarket, get all your canned goods,  and your flashlights, and your batteries?  That's what I'm asking.  Do I need to do that?  Yeah, you better.  It's Frankenstorm.  I order every meal for delivery.  So I'm going to be out for food.  And I don't have any friends in the building.  I'm new in the building.  I don't know any of my neighbors.  So what could be the problem if you live alone? 
[02:16:30]  The lights go out, and Joe's by himself.  And has to think.  You know, when the lights go out, I like it.  It's a nice break from everything.  Throw on a couple candles, and everything shut off.  You've got a family around you people talk to.  I don't care.  I've got to be by himself.  I kind of liked that growing up.  We would lose our lights all the time.  You get the fire...  When your mom and dad didn't pay the bills.  When you're alone, it's shut.  Well, it's a good thing.  Buzz and Frankenstorm.  Well, folks drank a little.  I don't think anything ever happens.  Nothing ever happens.  Thank you, Tom Green. 
[02:17:00]  Tell Joe DeRozan.  Yeah, nothing's going to happen.  Nothing ever happens.  How do you know, Tom?  They do it to stifle business in the city.  You know, like every time you have a...  I was in Washington last year, and they said the big hurricane was coming in.  And, you know, nobody came to my show, because nobody left the house.  Right.  And it was a light drizzle.  Right.  And everyone was avoiding the light drizzle.  So you cursed the storms, right?  Yeah.  This one's going to be bad.  Nothing's going to happen.  But Joe's talking like he's an 85-year-old man living by himself. 
[02:17:30]  What if he slips on the ice?  What if?  What if I slip on the ice?  Are you really worried?  What?  You're worried that you live alone in the storm's hitting?  Look, it's a little nerve-wracking when you live alone and you've got no neighbors.  Let's say one of my windows blow in.  So?  Blows in.  What happens then?  Let's say I get sucked out of the window.  Some sort of wind suction thing happens.  You might lose a Frank Zappa record, but besides that, you'll be all right.  My Zappa's warped.  I'm just going to be lonely. 
[02:18:00]  That's really all it comes down to.  He doesn't want to be alone with his thoughts.  That's his problem.  I've never been scared of a storm.  Well, because you're a big tough...  You should be now.  This is Frank and the storm.  I was mad when we had to fucking leave the Outer Banks when that hurricane hit.  Me and my brother were ready to fucking stick it out.  But the people around me, including...  Well, I did have a one and a half at the time.  So they said, look, we got to go.  You can't ride out a storm with a baby.  I know.  Good point, bud.  We were excited.  We're like, we'll hide the cars because they... 
[02:18:30]  Hide the cars.  Well, it was a mandatory evacuation.  But we talked to some of the locals that weren't leaving.  I go, look, these people have been through this shitload.  If they're not leaving, they know it's a bust.  So why don't we stay, too?  We'll hide the cars behind the house and let's check it out.  Tie a string to our kid's ankle.  Well, that was the problem with the kid thing, I guess, in the end.  Joe's going to be in trouble.  I'm worried about Joe this week.  I'm worried.  I would be worried about tornadoes.  That's the only thing.  Hurricanes, for the most part, no.  Well, your windows can blow in.  Hurricanes move so fucking slow, you can get out of the way if you have to. 
[02:19:00]  This one's going to be bad because of the power.  All the power is going to go out.  We're going to be in darkness.  Did they ever hit New York?  They hit New York, the Hurricanes.  They actually hit New York.  Very rare.  They don't dissipate before they dissipate.  That's a good weather term.  Or nor'easters.  Nor'easters, we guess.  And nor'easters are rough.  Sideways sleet and snow.  That's okay.  That's our thing.  I'm just going to find some friends and do the whole, let's have a hurricane sleepover.  Do you want to sleep over in my house?  Not really.  We'll play some spoon and we'll spoon. 
[02:19:30]  I mean, not when the invitation comes like that, Opie.  It's not that, when you, when the mics are off, I'll give you the real invitation.  The funny thing is, you've got a much worse, better chance of getting killed by a crack addict.  You know what I mean?  Especially where you're living.  If you really think about it, you live in New York.  That's what I'm scared of.  The power goes out, the crack addicts storm the building, and they're fucking dead.  Just have crack.  Just have crack.  And you just be like, my God, you guys are here.  Ken, what about the crack on a big old bit?  Sprinkle a little crack on the stoop. 
[02:20:00]  They'll stop coming.  What about the crack I'm going to need?  Say I'm going to have to go out and buy extra crack.  This is my point.  What kind of supplies do I need?  No, the problem is going to be when all the power goes out and then it snows for like three nights.  Yeah, you can't take care of yourself for a couple days without electricity.  Listen, I'm fucking excellent at taking care of myself.  Were you a boy scout?  If I'm alone for too long, the thoughts start getting at me a little bit.  Yeah.  It sounds like you were an Eagle Scout.  I was a boy scout and a cub scout.  Oh, so you can do some knots.  I know how to do things.  I know how to knot. 
[02:20:30]  Were you touched?  No.  A lot of boy scout stories coming out.  Swear to God I wasn't.  All right.  Swear to God I wasn't.  Would you like to be?  No, I never was either.  Were you a boy scout type?  I didn't ask you.  No, I know.  Jesus, Opie.  I just thought I'd throw that up.  No, he was defusing.  He was defusing.  I just thought I'd throw that up.  Make sure.  No, no, no.  Not me.  Did I say that I wasn't touched too quickly?  Yes, that's what I'm getting at.  So fast.  I'm like, wow, we didn't even get to him yet.  Tom, were you in the Boy Scouts?  I wasn't touched. 
[02:21:00]  I wasn't molested in the Boy Scouts either.  Thanks for asking.  It was just the speed of the answer that threw me off.  It could be one of those hidden memories.  And one day you're just driving down the road going,  I think this is that day.  Hey, I think my uncle blew me.  Oh, my God.  How the fuck?  Oh, that's what that merit badge was for.  I'm just sitting here having a beer and I just thought something.  My brother is hilarious, but he just can't do radio, unfortunately.  He tells a story how when he was pulling out his little pee-pee at the summer house that we all went to, 
[02:21:30]  my uncle's giant hog would come over his shoulder because he would share the fucking bathroom with my brother.  But the way he tells it and how he describes the whole scene is fucking classic.  Just came over just in a ping?  Well, we had one bathroom and it was sort of like the Kennedy compound, except we didn't have money.  The poor version.  Yeah, the poor version with one toilet.  But, I mean, 20 cousins, aunts, uncles.  So it was just, you just shared the bathroom. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  If you had to go, you had to go.  The uncle's not waiting for the kids to come out.  Nah, they were all beer drinkers back then.  They weren't going to wait around for my brother, who was 10 at the time, trying to fucking take a leak.  So he would whip out his giant fucking horse cock.  You've got to hear him tell it.  I will get him to tell some of these stories, but whatever.  I think that Joe will be fine.  I think if he can make some knots and if he can make his own fire.  Well, he did ask.  He goes, how do you prepare for something like this?  Well, I've got to go out and buy.  I didn't mean how. 
[02:22:30]  What do you have to buy?  Duck tape?  Don't you have something in your cupboards?  No, I literally have nothing in my house.  I moved into a studio apartment.  The kitchen area is so fucking small that I just was like, fuck it.  I'm not cooking.  I can't deal with this.  And I have no food in my house.  Nothing.  You need an emergency kit.  Yeah.  Tuna fish.  I have a toolbox.  Is that going to help?  Tuna fish.  Pack of cigarettes.  Yeah.  A rechargeable radio.  A crank radio.  So you can listen to Opie and Anthony. 
[02:23:00]  To the updates.  You know that the Nicaraguans are going to be out delivering food.  I don't know.  They're going to bring food to your house.  On their bike slash motorcycle.  They work.  You live in New York City.  Listen, I know.  Maybe you're from the middle of the woods.  Hold on a second.  Without food.  You misinterpreted my question.  You misinterpreted my question.  There's opportunists too.  They will be wandering around with coolers at the very least.  You misinterpreted my question. 
[02:23:30]  I wasn't saying how as in tell me what to do.  I was saying how bad is this going to be?  How much prep do I need to do for this fucking thing?  That's what I was saying.  I have a perfect storm coming together.  Three different storms are coming together at the same time.  That's right.  Cold.  The sandy.  And the frogs.  They say if it all hits that New York is going to be black.  It already is.  Darkness.  The flooding that you've got to worry about.  The flooding.  When the ocean comes over the sides. 
[02:24:00]  Are they going to dock us a couple days here if we're not doing our show, Ron?  You know these people.  No.  If this city goes dark, they're going to fucking dock a couple of our days.  If you can get here by boat, you should be doing your show.  Is this scout thing, the molesting and the scouts, is that like a big problem?  Is that turning into a big thing or something?  There's a few stories coming out.  Is it going to be a big thing like Jerry Sandusky kind of big or bigger than that?  Yeah, I don't know if we've got one guy though.  Really?  That we could pin it on, like Jerry Sandusky. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, it's just been going on for years.  Whoever designed the scouts.  I was in the Cub Scouts.  You were?  I never really saw anything suspicious going on up in the Cub Scouts.  I stopped after the Cub Scouts.  Yeah, I stopped after the Cub Scouts.  I thought it was nonsense.  The Weeblows.  The Weeblows, right.  The Cub Scouts.  Yeah, there you go.  That's all you need to know.  Weeblows.  I know it's a hack joke, bud.  No, but who should have been?  Weeblows.  Not in this tent, we don't.  I'll be over here making a wallet.  Who used to do that fucking joke?  You remember that joke?  I think that was Slappy Carmichael.  Come on, Tom. 
[02:25:00]  It wasn't Slappy Carmichael.  It was one year in between the Cub Scouts and the Boy Scouts when you were like 10.  Yeah, it was the transitional period where they really showed you how to work a cuck.  Wow.  Weeblows.  And then you were ready for the fucking majors.  They didn't have the Weeblows.  I just remember, I lived in northern Canada for a while in a Canadian Army base because  my dad was in the Canadian Army.  Wow.  And so we lived in the middle of the woods for a while.  And the Cub Scouts and the Beavers, did they have beavers down here too?  Yeah.  Beavers.  Were they the girls? 
[02:25:30]  Before the Cub Scouts.  Yeah, so that was pretty good.  We'd go out in the woods and we'd go look at bears and stuff like that.  But then we moved to the city.  By bears, you meant fat gay men.  No, that's what happened when we moved to the city.  That became that.  No, then we moved to the city, though, like when I was like seven or something.  And my last year at Cubs, all we'd do is we'd go down to the high school gymnasium and  play murder ball every Wednesday night.  That's all we did.  Yeah, you know, dodge ball.  Yeah.  Yeah, we called it dodge ball.  That's all we did in the Scouts.  More than Canada. 
[02:26:00]  How cold are you?  You're going to northern Canada next week.  So from what you learned during that experience, how would you prepare for this storm?  I just, you know, play dodge ball, I guess.  Northern Canada.  How cold does it get up there?  Oh, it gets, it's, you can swear on the radio here, right?  It gets fucking cold.  Oh, Jesus.  It gets fucking cold.  Jeepers.  Yeah, yeah, no, it's ridiculous.  Yeah, absolutely.  And they needed an army base way up there.  Yeah, they just kind of stick them up there in the woods.  Case North.  Petawawa. 
[02:26:30]  Thank you.  Case North Bull attacks.  He's there.  CFB Petawawa.  If you're listening now, everybody Google that.  That's where I grew up.  I'm playing there next weekend.  Petawawa.  Yeah.  Nice town.  You're going to Newfoundland next week.  I am.  That's amazing.  Are you really?  Yeah, yeah.  With the new fees.  Yeah, I'm going to Newfoundland.  That's going to be.  Playing St. John's, and then I'm going to Halifax to a little Canadian run.  Oh, yeah, that's great.  Trailer Park Boys are from Halifax.  Yeah, those are funny guys.  I'm going out drinking with bubbles from the Trailer Park Boys tonight if you want to come. 
[02:27:00]  Very nice.  Yeah.  Are they good drinkers?  They are good drinkers.  Are you a good drinker?  I drank too much last night.  What's your drink?  I'm just going to come clean and say I'm slightly hungover right now, but that's a good thing  because I'm having fun in New York City.  But you wear it well.  Yeah, well, I'm trying to.  I drank some water.  What do you drink, Tom?  Scotch.  Oh, yeah?  Good scotch?  Scotch and beer is what I'm doing now.  Nice.  Yeah.  I've had the privilege of drinking with you a couple times, and man, you fucking do it  good, man.  Yeah.  You really like to put it.  I love it.  I'm cutting back a little bit, though.  I'm cutting back a little bit. 
[02:27:30]  I'm trying to keep it together.  I'm cutting back a little bit.  Yeah, I am cutting back a little bit.  I'm under control.  What is cutting back?  Scotch is pretty fucking...  Scotch is pretty serious.  I had four drinks last night.  Two scotches?  Two scotch and two or three beer.  That's five drinks.  Okay.  And you're really hungover for me?  Six beer.  But isn't each scotch about, I don't know, four beers, I'd say?  I'm not too wrecked. 
[02:28:00]  I'm not too wrecked.  But I feel in it a bit.  You look good.  Yeah.  Thanks, man.  Thanks.  Tom, you a drinker?  Yeah.  I'm not heavy, but yeah.  When you can?  I'm a martini man.  Really?  Yeah.  Fancy.  Yeah, I'm fancy.  Ever since I had kids, it's more like a cocktail hour kind of thing.  Vodka, martinis?  Dirty?  Old school or the fancy ones?  Kettle ones straight up dry with olives.  Whoa.  Nice.  Yeah.  Well, that's just, you know.  I like them.  Maybe we should have a drink.  Should we have a drink right now, possibly? 
[02:28:30]  Whiskey's good.  If you need one to get rid of the shakes, Tom, sure, we can do that for you.  A little hair of the dog.  A little hair of the dog, the pitcher.  And some cutting back on the...  Crowd was good at Caroline's.  Yeah, it was great.  It's after nine.  Yeah.  It's time to have a drink.  I would have a beer if there was one around, to be honest with you.  Do you want to have a beer here?  I would have one.  Jesus Christ.  No, just to cut it out.  Seriously, where's my scotch from Ron White?  Okay.  Just for the show.  Just for the show.  Yeah, for the sake of the show. 
[02:29:00]  What did Tom Popp ask for?  Oh, yeah.  I interviewed Ron White, and he gave me a bottle of scotch that is, I think, here on Steve's  desk.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  What kind of scotch?  I don't know.  I'm going to get it for you.  I've been drinking this Balvini lately.  That's a really good...  Balvini.  ...tasty scotch that I've been drinking.  Balvini scotch.  Is it good?  Yeah, it's a good scotch.  Expensive?  Well, you can get the expensive stuff.  It depends on the year.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  It's not too bad. 
[02:29:30]  The great Balvini.  Sort of expensive.  That's a Gleason reference.  So it's going to be a big storm right here.  Yeah, thank you, Tom.  It's going to be a real Frankenstorm.  Hey, you're that guy, though.  Who gives a fuck?  I'm what guy?  It's his fucking...  I look at it as fun, because the city's different for a few days.  Yeah, the lights go out.  I love when we get pounded by fucking huge snowstorms. 
[02:30:00]  All that shit.  You feel a sense of community.  Everybody comes together.  I love all that.  Me too.  You have a family.  They'll be fine.  No, I'm...  That's not what I'm saying.  I'm saying you have a family to go through the experience with.  When you live alone in a building where you don't know anybody, it's not as fucking exciting.  It's a little fucking lonely.  Don't you have a girl?  No.  You don't have a girl?  No.  You don't touch kids, right?  No.  All right, then come on over.  Don't.  You come over for a day.  Don't.  High risk.  Why start?  You think it's high risk, right?  He's a single guy.  You don't have him around your kids. 
[02:30:30]  High risk.  You're a high risk.  Yeah.  He's a high risk.  High risk.  He's going to be like, hey, you guys, what do you ever hear of Zappa?  No offense, but he doesn't want his kids jacked up.  Actually, my two and a half.  Jesus Christ.  Good point, Ron.  Oh, my God.  Very good point.  My two and a half year old already sniffs it out.  He knows who the creepers are.  Well, in all fairness.  It's a weird sense these kids have.  He's cool to everyone that works in my building except one guy.  And I'm like, that's the guy.  He refuses to fucking shake his hand or anything. 
[02:31:00]  Really?  Talk to him.  He'll run to the door and open the door when we get people coming up with packages and  all that shit, food or whatever.  There's one guy.  As soon as he sees him, he turns and goes away.  And I tell my wife, that guy touches kids.  Smart.  I think they know.  Yeah.  I think kids can send dogs.  Kids know.  You think when you go over and they're like, oh, my dog doesn't like you.  That means you fuck dogs.  He's a dog toucher.  Yeah.  He's a dog toucher.  That's the worst kind.  Yeah. 
[02:31:30]  I don't want to come to a family's apartment, though, for this thing.  He shouldn't.  It's not that.  That's not the kind of shelter I'm looking for.  I'd rather stay with, like, friends that are single.  He knows themselves.  No, I just mean, but with a family.  I don't like being in a family environment because I'm afraid I'm going to say the wrong thing  or I'm going to piss off somebody or whatever.  He doesn't want to compare his life to a loving, happy life.  We'll make a short documentary.  We'll make a short documentary.  I scream that as soon as I wake up every morning.  Cut!  What are you afraid that you're going to do in front of a family of people? 
[02:32:00]  I'm not afraid of it.  I'm just like, it's just like, look, if it's between staying with a family and staying with  people my age that are single, I would rather just stay in the single people place.  That's all I'm saying.  Go with Ronnie's question.  What's the worst thing that could possibly happen if you stayed with me for a day?  I'm just not, I don't know.  I'm going to fucking curse in front of your kids like this.  I didn't even realize I was saying fuck just then.  I said it.  I don't want to curse in front of your kids.  I don't want to be the guy that annoys your wife because you're an annoying friends hero.  We curse in front of our kids.  You realize you're John Candy now, that we've come full circle, and you're that guy. 
[02:32:30]  You're going to find me on Tuesday night sitting in a train station by myself.  Come on, come out of the story.  We got our pal Jim Jeffries on the hotline.  Jim.  Hey, how you doing, man?  Very fucking busy day, sir.  Sorry to make you wait there.  No, that's all right.  I got nothing to do.  We got Ron Bennington, Joe DeRosa, Tom Papa, and Tom Green in studio.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Where are you calling from, man?  I'm in L.A. at the moment. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm just calling to plug the new special I've got coming out tonight.  But also, I'm having a baby in like 10 days.  Congratulations.  Oh, my gosh.  I just had my second three weeks ago.  Yeah, it's exciting.  Well, I got the girl who played the prostitute on my TV pilot pregnant, so, you know.  How great is that?  I hate when that happens. 
[02:33:30]  Are you guys still together?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's working out all right?  It happened after two months.  I didn't have much choice in being happy, but we're giving it a go.  We're giving it a go.  Where's your special, Jeff?  We've got one.  It's coming out on Epix, same as where Norton had his last one at 10 p.m. this evening.  Awesome.  Oh, very cool.  I got a copy of it in front of me.  I can't wait to watch it.  What's it called?  Fully functional.  It's the first special I've done sober, and I think you'll find it lacking for that very 
[02:34:00]  reason, but it's not bad.  Where are you at with your party?  Last time I talked to you, you were doing all right.  What's that?  Yeah, I'm doing all right, man.  At the moment, I'm doing this Epix TV show, and the hours are real long, so I haven't  had a drink for about a month and a bit now.  Wow.  That's amazing.  Well, Tom Green almost went four hours, but his drink is coming in studio.  He's having a beer right now.  Hey, Jim, am I coming to do your podcast next week? 
[02:34:30]  After he said he's cutting down.  Tom Green wants to know if he's doing your podcast.  Yeah, I think I'm doing your podcast next week, right?  Ah, if you want to do it, sure.  Yeah, yeah.  Why not?  Yeah, you're buddies with my friend Andrew Taylor from Australia, right?  Yeah, we have the same management in Australia, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's awesome, man.  That's awesome.  He's a drunk.  Yeah, I like drinking with Andrew.  I go drinking with Andrew a lot.  But you're cutting down.  Yeah.  Is it just drinking, or is there anything else going on? 
[02:35:00]  Just drinking, yeah.  Just drinking.  Obviously, you don't know him as well as I do.  I got to get on that.  That sounds good.  You don't do the drugs there, Tom Green?  No, I don't do the drugs, no.  A little pot every once in a while?  Occasionally, yeah.  I'll touch that occasionally.  A little Coke, though.  No, never tried it.  A little heroin?  Never touched it.  Just a little bit.  Never touched the stuff.  You never tried it?  Just a little take the edge off.  Never touched it.  Never tried it.  I've been a little...  You can drink more. 
[02:35:30]  You can drink more if you take the edge off.  You've always been a little nervous.  Is this the...  Yeah, it's the scotch.  Scotch.  Oh, that's the scotch.  Okay.  Black grouse.  He still wants that open, is what he's saying.  Were you going to grab a...  Is there a beer?  Is there a beer around?  I can't drink the scotch.  Tom?  No, I don't need beer.  I don't need beer.  I don't want a beer.  I don't want a beer.  Give Tom a beer.  I don't want a beer.  No, I don't want a beer.  It's okay.  I'm sort of kidding.  Tom is certain that's for a beer.  He thought the giant bottle in a box was a beer.  He picked it up and goes, is this the beer?  No, that's scotch.  You really wanted to see what was inside that. 
[02:36:00]  No, I don't want to drink the scotch because that'll just ruin the day.  We'll be gone if I start drinking scotch in the morning.  Just go home and go to bed.  What are you going to do?  A beer.  What else are you going to do?  You got press today?  No, not really, actually.  I guess I could go sleep it off in the afternoon.  I'd just go right to the bar.  Sorry if I were you.  Jim Jeffries.  Yes.  So after the kid's born, you guys get married or any of that?  Look, I don't know, man.  That's what her plan is, I guess. 
[02:36:30]  My mother's very keen on it.  It's like we've got the TV show and it's called Legit.  My mom rings me up and she goes, what's the name of your TV show?  I go, it's called Legit.  She goes, how can your show be called Legit when your child is illegitimate?  Wow.  Mom's known how to make it hurt.  Yes.  And now I'm like, I want to fight against it a little bit and just, you know, the whole  idea of a bastard child, at least, you know, you get to call him something occasionally 
[02:37:00]  when he's naughty and it actually is appropriate.  I don't think I'll be getting married anytime soon or at least telling anyone.  Right.  Oh, you would do it like, just fucking get it done.  Yeah, but it's just, what's the big point?  I've got a baby.  That's a fairly big commitment, right?  It is.  It is.  It is, sir.  And I'm sick and tired of every cunt that I meet just telling me how hard it's going 
[02:37:30]  to be.  Yeah.  Oh, you don't know how hard it's going to be.  It's going to be crying and waking you up all the time.  And it's like, I used to take a lot of coke and I was waking up feeling shitty with a  dry mouth from alcohol and all that type of stuff.  I think I can wake up because something's crying every now and again.  Oh, there you go.  You're experienced.  Yeah, but there's good times when you had to do coke.  That's the only real difference.  There is some fun in your life.  That's a great way to look at it, man. 
[02:38:00]  I never thought of it like that.  What?  Jim, what you're saying about like, look, man, you know, I've woke up hungover with a  splitting fucking head at 6 a.m. a million times.  You know, if I'm sober and a baby's waking me up, it's not that big of a deal.  You know, that's a fucking great philosophy.  So you're going to have kids now, Jim?  There's a theory that I should like the child.  What's up?  There's a theory that I should like the child, right?  Uh, I mean, theoretically, but that's, you know, that's old school bullshit, you know?  Why?  As soon as that kid pops out, it's instant love. 
[02:38:30]  Oh.  Jim's going to love this baby.  Oh, God.  There really is.  In most cases.  Hacky dad things to say.  Well, what are you going to do?  Jim Jeffries, you...  I will grow into twice the size.  Ah, I deserve it.  Jim, you call me when the baby's born and you tell me how you feel.  Yeah, all right.  I think it might surprise the hell out of you.  That's what I'm saying.  Will be one of the most disappointing days in comedy if I ever hear Jim Jeffries go,  the minute I saw it, mate.  I mean, I just... 
[02:39:00]  I didn't say we have to do it on the show.  I do shit off the show, too.  But it would disappoint me so bad to hear Jim Jeffries say that.  Maybe we would just have a little conversation where we could relate on something.  It's, you know, that's all I'm saying.  Relate as far as a human emotion goes.  Oh, really?  Guy that doesn't cry at movies?  You want to talk human emotions over here?  I said, uh, Plans, transit automobile when he brings...  Yeah, I like how DeRosa is shitting on the love of a father to a child, but he'll ball  during Love Actually.  Right, right.  And Rush playing Spirit of the Radio. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  Or Spirit of the Radio.  Jeffries, I cried seeing Rush play Spirit of the Radio.  These guys are trashing me.  So that means if you became a father, you would fucking ball, is what I'm saying.  I would ball.  I would ball.  You would be a little...  But that's not the point.  You'd be a little bitch in that delivery room.  That's not the point.  You're crying and saying the blood is icky.  Come on, Paul.  You're going to fucking fight.  Don't tell me I wouldn't cry when my baby's born.  Yeah, thank you, Tom.  The shit you admitted you cried to, and you're fucking giving me shit.  Oh, big surprise. 
[02:40:00]  Tom's coming at me.  A big fucking surprise today in this studio.  Tom's been awfully nice to you today.  Tom's been all over me today.  Like white on rice.  Jeffries.  In this fucking room.  Tell Jeff about your web series.  Yeah.  What?  Tell Jeff about your web series.  Don't be...  Why do you do that?  What?  That's mean.  This is a real fight now, Jim Jeffries.  Just listen.  This is going to be ugly.  Hey, Jim, did you know Tom's in a new big movie with...  Who are you in it?  Michael Douglas?  Michael Douglas.  I thought you said Clint Eastwood. 
[02:40:30]  There's someone else in there, too.  What time?  You're kidding, really?  I didn't believe it either.  You keep saying it's true, though.  Tom Popper...  Last time I saw Jim, we were in a parking garage together.  Ed?  It was when he was going to get this show.  I was going to pitch the show.  I was all excited.  Yeah.  Wow.  No shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, I can't wait to see the FX show.  Yeah, me too.  When does that hit?  First or second Thursday in January.  In January.  It's basically the Louis time slot in his off season. 
[02:41:00]  Awesome.  Very cool.  Yeah, Louis taking the year off.  What's the show about, Jim?  It's just my stand-up story.  The first...  I can tell you every episode.  Now, the first story is just me taking a friend with muscular dystrophy to a brothel, right?  And then the rest of it was just other stories from a stand-up.  But then FX went, we really like the guy who's playing the muscular dystrophy character.  So now it's just all my stories plus a guy in a wheelchair.  Ron, you ever hear that story?  They actually...  He actually took his friend to a whorehouse to get him laid. 
[02:41:30]  It's a great story.  There's muscular dystrophy.  It's an amazing story.  What?  I went back to Australia and saw that guy sort of back in December and I was like, the  guy that I took to the prostitute that was having muscular dystrophy and I thought, you  know what?  I should take him again.  I've made so much money out of this story.  I should take him again.  And he went, thanks, Jim.  You're so good to me.  I go back to the prostitute and every fucking hooker knew his name.  It's like he uses a sob story on everyone.  It was like Norm walking into the bar at Cheers. 
[02:42:00]  Wow.  Hey, I'll tell you something cool.  A couple of days ago, we just signed him on for the show.  He's in three episodes.  Fucking John Ratzenberg's coming on the show.  Damn.  Oh, nice, man.  Yeah, and that's all because I met him with you guys.  So I appreciate that.  Oh, that's how that came about?  Yeah, yeah.  Remember, I was sitting there doing impersonations of him the whole time and he remembered me.  No kidding, yeah.  Do you do the impersonation to him like on the show?  Has that worked into one of the scripts somehow? 
[02:42:30]  Well, the thing is, he hasn't come on set yet for one of his episodes, but that'll be happening,  whether he likes it or not.  He does.  I don't know.  Can you do a little?  I know it's a hack, but...  It's a bit early in the morning to be...  I got to really do it.  Okay, it's...  That was great.  He really does an amazing impression.  I see him a face.  Yeah.  Tom, you got questions for Jim Jeffries?  You're quiet over there. 
[02:43:00]  What part of Australia?  Are you from Melbourne?  Melbourne?  Sydney?  I'm from Sydney.  Sydney.  You're from Sydney.  Yeah, I like Sydney.  I like that.  We had a good time over there this year in Sydney.  Yeah.  I did a little tour over in Australia.  I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Yeah.  I heard that you're quite popular over there.  You had a lot of fun over there.  Held a koala bear over there.  Yeah, that's always fun.  There's certain states you can hold the koala bear, and in certain states you're not allowed  to, because you know some Asian tourist has fucking dropped one. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, in Queensland.  You're allowed to hold them in Queensland.  Yeah, they don't care for the welfare of koala.  I went to the Brisbane koala sanctuary, and I held the koala bear, and then they told  me that they're the number one carrier of chlamydia.  They are?  Yeah.  They told me that right after I fucked it.  I was going to have fun.  Right after.  I wish they told me.  I wish they hadn't waited until after I fucked it.  Okay.  I don't know what's going on.  I love how Americans tell me things like that.  Like, I held a koala bear.  It's like me rocking up to one of you guys and going, I saw a squirrel in the park. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  I'd like to know about this squirrel I saw.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm Canadian, though, so.  My girlfriend's Canadian.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm Canadian.  Look, calling a Canadian American is like calling a...  Squirrel a koala bear?  A New Zealander an Aussie.  Yeah, but not the other way around, because Australians don't care if you call us New Zealanders,  because New Zealand's like Australia's retarded little brother.  Yeah.  They get real offended by it.  The Kiwis get real offended when you ask if they're Australian. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  I don't know what the deal is, you know?  There's only three million of them, and all they have is rugby.  Yeah.  They get a bit competitive.  Yeah.  So what are you guys thinking?  Australia?  I love the fucking...  I'm thinking Australia.  I love the silence.  It's so funny.  Usually you're supposed to jump in and save it.  I just love it.  I love when it goes flat.  What do you guys think of this whole Donald Trump situation?  I think he's amazing.  Yeah?  Do you like the way that Donald Trump came out and had a big announcement that he was going 
[02:45:00]  to make?  And then he piped this big announcement, said that he was going to announce something about  the president, and then there was nothing?  At that time, he really read this country wrong.  He really thought everyone would be all about it.  Guys, the crazy part about the big announcement is, it wasn't that big of an announcement.  Yeah.  There was no announcement, wasn't he?  He said he would pay money for an announcement.  Wasn't he?  He said he was offered five million dollars.  He was supposed to have the announcement. 
[02:45:30]  If there was something.  Right, right, right.  What's the theory?  What's he trying to find out?  He wants some of Obama's records, and he's willing to give Obama five million dollars to  his favorite charity.  And he just assumed that the president would fucking, you know, go with this.  But wouldn't it be weird if, like he said, his five million dollars for your favorite  charity, if I could see your university reports, because he thinks that Obama had something  like really weird going on in university.  It turns out that Obama didn't, and then he gets the five million dollars, and he donates  it to terrorism. 
[02:46:00]  Well, okay.  It's Al-Qaeda.  The bigger story was that Ann Coulter called Obama a retard.  Yeah.  And that was the, that kind of overshadowed the Trump thing.  I'm not a huge, uh, Coulter fan, but.  I'm just saying, I'm not.  I never held a Kuala.  No, what's the big deal?  I'm not saying, isn't it awesome.  I'm saying it was the bigger news story.  Right.  But we're not allowed to do that, I guess.  No hope it was just the bigger story.  The correct term is Mongoloid. 
[02:46:30]  Mongoloid.  We could do that.  Right.  Oh, she, okay.  They were upset at the.  Reed side.  Oh, I got it now.  Mongoloid.  Yeah, I mean, that overshadowed the Trump thing as we're pointing.  We're running out of words in this country.  You got this problem in Canada there, Tom?  Where, there's words you're not allowed to say.  Words.  Words.  Yeah, it's exactly the same in Canada.  That's the, that's the thing that's starting to get, get weird about Canada is it's exactly  the same.  Didn't a comedian get.  Everything is exactly the same there now.  Didn't a comedian get, uh, prosecuted for saying something on stage in Canada? 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, he did.  Yeah, he got banned.  Really?  Yeah.  He got actually, uh.  Banned.  He was banned from comedy and he was fined $30,000.  A lawsuit.  I never heard of it.  I did not hear about that.  What did he say?  He said, he said that he.  Was that retard or?  We're saying retard?  I think it was, uh, an anti-gay slur.  It was, uh, lesbians, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He made fun of lesbians.  He made fun of lesbians.  Like the Lenny Bruce of Canada.  The modern era.  Yes, he is.  That's awesome.  Oh, it'd be nice to get banned for something from comedy. 
[02:47:30]  It'd be a nice feeling.  But you wouldn't have to do it anymore.  Yeah.  More time to drink.  Yeah.  I know.  Speaking of this, where's that beer?  You got his beer, by the way?  We're working on it.  Oh, we went to get you a beer.  Oh, that's how good we are.  Oh, thanks.  But you don't want it, right?  That should be every comedian's goal, I think, to say something that gets them banned and fined.  Really.  It's not that hard these days.  Is it actually possible to get banned anymore for saying stuff?  I think if Jim Jefferies hasn't been banned.  Maybe he wasn't banned.  Maybe I'm exaggerating. 
[02:48:00]  I'm pretty sure he was, though.  I think he was not allowed to do comedy.  Just making up stories.  How can you be banned from comedy?  You can be banned from a club.  No one can stop you from doing comedy.  We don't have a society or anything like that.  There isn't like a Jedi Council.  Yeah.  Where Cat Williams tells you you can't do it anymore.  I think I made it up.  I think the banned thing I made up.  Jeez.  Jeez.  Go prepare for the storm.  That's terrible.  Making Canada sound like this Nazi state where they banned people from speaking. 
[02:48:30]  They still fined the guy for 30 grand.  I mean, that's pretty fucking bad.  There was a big deal up there.  That's pretty fucking bad.  I want to find out more about this.  He's not allowed to order chicken fingers off of any menu.  I would like to get banned in comedy club.  No, no.  Wait a minute.  I think he wasn't allowed to perform for like six months.  Doesn't anyone have the internet?  Can someone look it up?  Why are we listening to Joe on the internet?  Tom Green's in the internet seat.  Yeah.  I'll do it.  Yeah.  I don't know if you can multitask.  I'm not really sure.  I'm afraid if I type in banned from Canada, my name will pop up. 
[02:49:00]  We've got more alcohol choices coming in for Tom Green.  My picture will pop up.  Somebody Google Tom Green koala bear.  Under banned from Canada.  Iraq, what do we got for Tom Green?  More alcohol choices, Tom.  All right.  Here's what happened.  I'll have a beer.  I mean, I'm not going to.  Well, what kind of beer are you going to bring?  I'll have a Stella.  Yeah, that sounds good.  Thank you, man.  Appreciate that.  Thank you.  We've got some wine.  And we've got some wine, Tom.  Just a Stella's good.  I'm thinking beer to the wine to the scotch.  You'll be good.  Yeah, we'll start with the... 
[02:49:30]  What do you got, Ron?  The guy's name is...  Cheers, guys.  Cheers.  Cheers.  What is that?  He insulted a lesbian couple that heckled him at the nightclub.  I don't think so.  $30,000.  He had to pay them.  He had to pay the...  Yep.  The couple.  For insulting...  You can get...  Really, huh?  Yeah.  And wasn't he not allowed to perform for a while or something?  That part I don't see on here.  Why does Canada let that happen?  Because they're a Nazi state?  Yeah, they're Canada.  What the heck is going on?  Would that happen in Australia? 
[02:50:00]  Was it a defamation claim or what was it?  You ask why and they...  Stand-up comedian Guy Earle was ordered to pay money, pay the money to Lorna Party.  Did Ron just do it?  32, while the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal...  It's a run of the show.  It doesn't say what happened here.  Oh.  He directed homophobic and sexist insults at her.  Right.  When he was the master of ceremonies at an open mic comedy show.  Open mic. 
[02:50:30]  So, big...  Directed homophobic and sexist insults.  Isn't that what comedy is all about?  Directing insults at people?  Well, in this country it is, too.  Yeah.  Don't you go to the show to get insults directed at you?  Well, Canada doesn't make sense.  You put your army bases way up north.  Why?  Oh, it's so annoying.  This story makes me furious.  He also denied that he said some of the things he has been accused of.  You know, you really should consider people's feelings. 
[02:51:00]  He said that the...  Before you tell jokes.  The patron threw a drink in his face.  Sounds like a pretty crazy night at the comedy club.  Sounds like a fun night at the club.  All right, listen.  Let's get Jim Jeffries off the phone.  Repeated vulgar language.  Poor Jim.  Yeah.  Sorry, Jim.  That's all right.  He's going to read the whole story.  You hear him just yawn.  You hear him just yawn and stress.  We've learned in this business years ago.  You just have to read the first two sentences of any story and you got it all. 
[02:51:30]  He attacks parties' identity and dignity as a woman and a lesbian.  Jim, do you attack lesbians in your special tonight on Epics?  I think I probably do.  I can't.  I know I definitely did in my last special.  Odds are good you will.  Yeah.  Yeah, look.  If those poofs are going to watch it, they deserve what they get.  All right, Jim, when are you going to be in our area? 
[02:52:00]  Soon, hopefully?  I'm thinking probably not until the new year.  All right.  We'll see you then.  I might call in again.  It's been a lot of fun.  I'll sleep through the middle bit.  All right.  Congrats on the FX show.  I'm very excited for you.  And, of course, the special tonight on Epics.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thanks for having me call in.  And congratulations ahead of time on the kid.  Yeah, well, the 6th of November, we cut the thing out.  But the doctor's making his go in at 8 a.m., which I think it's a bit early to be waking up. 
[02:52:30]  But, you know.  It's going to be hard on you.  It's going to be hard on Jim Jeffries.  It's tough, yeah.  I feel bad for you, dude.  I sent you some flowers that day.  I feel bad you might have to get up a little early.  My best to your girlfriend.  At least you can take one for her.  Yeah, tell her to have some consideration and move the appointment back.  At least you'll have a face that you can have in your mind when you're writing those checks for the rest of your life. 
[02:53:00]  I bought a house about two weeks before she conceived.  And so, you know, it'll be nice to live here for the next eight months.  Is she American?  She's Canadian.  Oh.  Man, it's all coming full circle right now.  It really is.  Does she look like John Candy?  All right, Jim.  Thank you, sir.  Have a good weekend.  All right.  Thanks, Michael.  All right.  Jim Jeffries, we're going to break and then finish up next. 
[02:53:30]  Tom Green at Caroline's team.  Tom Green!  Thank you.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Loving the hang today. 
[02:54:00]  We've got Tom Poppuk.  Yeah.  Tom Green and Ron Bennington from Ron and Fez.  It's a nice group of people.  It is.  Ron and Fez at 11 o'clock today.  Kind of miss Joe, though, don't you?  You know what I mean?  Oh, yeah.  Joe's gone.  He was so long.  He took off.  He's getting ready for the storm.  I feel, I don't know.  You get ready for storms, Ron?  No.  You get ready for storms?  No, I don't care about storms anymore.  Because I've had too many false alarms with storms over the years.  You get all worried, everything, you're all nervous, and then nothing happens. 
[02:54:30]  What about, you're in L.A. now, right?  Yeah.  So what about the earthquakes?  You have a kit.  I've never experienced a bad earthquake situation in L.A.  So you don't have like.  I've been there for 12 years.  You don't have extra water or anything?  No, no, I, uh, nothing.  Nope.  Can of beans?  I probably should get a little, uh, you know.  I figure there's always someone you can wrestle to the ground and take their shit.  Oh, you're that guy?  I mean, if, you know, worse comes to worse.  I'm less concerned about.  So I figure I can leave my house, and I know there's at least somebody. 
[02:55:00]  I know I'm not at the top, certainly, but I know there's a few below me.  So I'll grab their water and stuff if it comes down to it.  Especially if I have to feed my kids.  Opie, you've worked in radio long enough that any time a big storm comes up, Zario Speedwagon  riding the storm out.  Riding the storm out.  That's all.  Everything you need to know is in that song.  That's right.  You ride the storm out.  We did that bit recently, too.  And I remember that song rocking a little harder than it really is. 
[02:55:30]  Well, it doesn't really rock like I remember it.  Grab the live version.  You don't want the studio version.  Well, that's what some asshole said to me on Twitter.  Well, that's because you didn't play the live version.  No, don't knock, are you?  You played the studio track.  There's a couple of songs like that, like, make sure you grab the live.  They get mad at you.  I'm not even thinking about the storm, really.  Local news loves it, though.  I'm thinking about it because I'm supposed to fly on Monday.  So now they're saying Tuesday, 8 a.m., so maybe you'll be there.  You might want to squeeze out of here a little early. 
[02:56:00]  I'm more concerned about total economic collapse and anarchy.  You see that as a problem?  I think that is scarier to me and more likely.  And more likely because nobody seems to be in control.  Yeah, a total economic collapse.  Our credit cards no longer work.  Yeah.  Money becomes valueless.  Do you have a stash of dough?  No, I wish.  Yeah.  I wish.  Gold. 
[02:56:30]  You need a gun.  You need gold.  And you need a girl.  The three dreams.  I have none of them.  And you got a movie.  Don't you think that we should be past gold by now?  Like, I can understand thousands of years ago.  Oh, it's shiny rocks.  But, you know, we have fucking iPads now.  Why do you want to look at gold and a diamond?  Why is this still valuable?  It's a limited commodity, right?  So when money is valueless and the numbers of zeros and ones in your bank account become 
[02:57:00]  irrelevant, you can take a gold coin and you can stick it in your pocket.  You can buy a stake with a gold coin.  You can buy a suit.  But only...  You need a suit.  If there's anarchy, you're not really going to get a suit.  I love walking down the street with you.  I'm going to get a stake in a suit.  Let me get a suit and a cigar.  You can carry it with you.  But the problem is no one's going to make you a stake at that point.  You're going to have to make your own stake.  Yeah.  You buy the whole cow, though, man.  Yeah.  But, you know, but I mean, but the money isn't worth anything. 
[02:57:30]  I don't understand the money not being worth anything thing.  Like, can't we just all agree that it's always going to be worth something?  Well, please.  We have to agree on the gold.  Yeah, we agreed on the gold.  So can't we agree on the money?  Well, no, because you can just continue to print money.  You can print more money.  You can't print more gold.  There's a limited amount of gold.  There's more gold.  We just haven't found it.  Yeah.  Asteroids.  Well, you heard about the diamond planet, right?  Diamond planet?  Yeah, exactly.  You haven't heard about the diamond planet?  It was in the news for one day. 
[02:58:00]  To me, it's the most amazing thing I've ever heard.  Yeah, it's hilarious.  And for the news, it's one story, and they move on.  It's like, no, how about we stay on the diamond planet for a while?  What do you mean, diamond planet?  There's a planet out there.  Supposedly, it's one huge, giant diamond.  Really?  Yes.  Can we get there?  They just discovered it.  You know, all the diamonds in the world are owned by one company, De Beers of South Africa.  They own all the diamonds.  Those are the people that chop hands off kids?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, you know, until that marketing...  They really shut down the news story about the diamond planet, though.  I'm thinking, why are we sending a rover to Mars to pick up dirt samples? 
[02:58:30]  Send it to the diamond planet, pick up diamond samples.  I just want a story a day on the diamond planet.  To me, I think that's the most fascinating thing I've heard in decades.  Send that Red Bull guy and go get it.  Right.  Yeah.  Holy fuck, that guy.  That guy was crazy.  Can you imagine you're on the edge and then it's time to jump?  Yeah.  Well, that's what Red Bull makes you do.  It's true.  It's true.  It's right there in the marketing.  People are putting vodka in it and it's still not enough. 
[02:59:00]  I'm going to the top of the earth.  I'm going to jump back down.  That was pretty sick.  It was.  That was amazing.  I watched it when he was spinning.  Yeah, yeah.  The out-of-control spinning?  The out-of-control spinning lasted a lot longer than they really expected.  Yeah, they didn't.  You could see everyone held their breath like, fuck, we've got to find this out.  When you watch it live, the out-of-control spinning happened for quite a while.  And then when they played the package re-edited YouTube videos that they play back, they kind  of cut a lot of the out-of-control spinning out.  I think they're, I don't, it was a scary. 
[02:59:30]  Well, they don't want kids to try it.  Yeah, what happened to the thing there, the thing that he jumped out of?  What happened to that?  Did that just fall down?  Yeah, that came back down.  Did it just fall?  It landed in a guy's pool and he's cool with it.  Yeah, what happened to that?  Yeah.  Did they, I mean, did they hear how thin the balloon itself was?  A tenth of a sandwich bag?  Yeah.  How is that, how did they not have a hole in that?  It's not even a Mylar Mickey Mouse balloon.  Right, no, not even.  It's pretty impressive. 
[03:00:00]  But we should get to the diamond planet.  I'm up for that.  I'll go.  Supposedly there's a fucking diamond planet.  But you know, diamonds weren't even valuable until De Beers started their whole marketing  campaign and tying it to weddings and stuff.  It wasn't, it really didn't have the value anywhere close to what it had.  And that was like only the 1940s.  So it's like, it seems all, all right, we're just deciding, like you said, we're deciding  gold is.  And if we bring the diamond planet back, then diamonds are worthless.  Yeah.  Supply and demand, baby.  I like that. 
[03:00:30]  I like that.  Let's make them worthless.  Well, that definitely seems more of a possibility of happening than the Frankenstorm.  And they had to name it.  Who named it the Frankenstorm?  The Post has it as Frankenstorm.  I saw it on Twitter yesterday.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  So after the JFK thing, right?  Yesterday, I was talking on the show yesterday.  I was because I've been hanging out with Richard Belzer, who wrote this great book called Dead  Wrong.  It's about the JFK assassination.  And yesterday I came on the show and I was talking about this book that I read. 
[03:01:00]  And Jim Norton doesn't believe that it was a conspiracy, right?  Right.  And so, you know, last night I was walking to Caroline's.  Oh, I got lost, by the way, on the way to Caroline's yesterday.  That was fun.  You've been there a lot.  I'm not sure which story I want to tell suddenly.  I'm walking.  I decided I'm going to walk from the Upper West Side to Caroline's.  So I'm walking and somehow, I guess, Broadway splits off on the 9th.  And I didn't realize I was not on Broadway anymore. 
[03:01:30]  And I was just walking and I just kept walking and I kept walking.  And all of a sudden I'm realizing I'm going to be late for the show.  I'm looking.  It's like it's 5 to 8.  I've been walking for half an hour.  Now I'm realizing I'm nowhere near Caroline's.  Then I notice I'm not on Broadway anymore.  So I go, oh, I'll flag a cab.  So I try to flag a cab.  There's no cabs.  It's all crowded at that time of day or whenever it's packed.  Off duty.  So I'm totally going to be late.  So then all of a sudden a rickshaw pulls up.  You did not.  A rickshaw.  I've got video of it on my phone. 
[03:02:00]  I'll post it on my YouTube page later.  Tom Green on YouTube.  Yeah, if you don't believe me.  But I jumped on this rickshaw.  And now this rickshaw guy is weaving me through, is that rush hour, 8 o'clock?  Yeah, Times Square, rush hour traffic.  Times Square traffic.  I nearly got killed by a bus, weaving through buses.  And I'm on the phone with my mom.  And I'm talking about my mother, my mom.  And I'm talking about the JFK situation.  You're obsessed with JFK.  And I'm obsessed with it. 
[03:02:30]  And then my mother says, you know, you'd better not talk about this on the telephone because, you know, they could be tracking this conversation.  And you're in an open air vehicle.  Yeah.  And I said, okay, yeah.  And then I actually got nervous about talking about the JFK conspiracy on my phone.  So I stopped talking about it.  And then now I'm talking about it on the radio.  How much did the guy hit you up for?  I actually gave him 40 bucks.  I gave him 40 bucks.  Well, one of those guys hammered out a couple for 440, I think it was. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  He asked for 20, but it was honestly, it was, it was, it was, he worked hard.  It was like a 15 minute solid run through crazy traffic.  And I, I, I, I just wanted to.  Oh, wait, it wasn't one of the bike guys.  No, it was, it was, it was.  Oh, it was really a rick.  He was running behind me.  Oh, no, he was on a bike.  He was on a bike.  He was pedaling.  He was pedaling.  He was pedaling.  They were really lost.  I was in Sri Lanka. 
[03:03:30]  Chinese people everywhere.  No, he was biking.  But, but yeah, so, so then, you know, you start thinking, okay, so you can't, you can't  talk about certain things on the phone.  Right.  Because they're listening to you.  The new cars that are coming out.  You hear about the new cars that are coming out?  The diamond cars?  They're going to have, they're going to have computers in them connected to the internet.  You know, they're going to have the iPad screen in them.  Yes.  And although, you know, there's a conspiracy there, you know.  What's that?  All those cars are going to be connected to the internet. 
[03:04:00]  Those cars.  And the insurance companies are going to be able to tell how fast you drive.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Watching you the whole time.  We're just about there already.  Yeah.  They're going to be able to tell how fast you drive.  Is there some companies where they, that you could, you could put that monitor in your  car and if, if you are like driving safely, they'll, they'll knock your rate down a little  bit.  I forget which one it was.  I think it might've been Allstate.  I don't really remember.  But they said.  A black box, basically, where they can keep track of your shit.  They give you a black box and they say, we'll give you a discount if you're a safe driver.  But you know what that really is about?  Which actually means. 
[03:04:30]  They don't want to pay out claims.  So they'll, they'll take your little stupid black box and go, well, we ain't paying shit.  You were going 70 miles.  And it means we'll charge you more.  Right.  If you drive fast.  But they're saying it's in your favor.  So you get, you get the car cause it's got the cool iPod thingy in it.  The iPad thingy.  I'm sorry.  What's that?  I thought we were having a discussion.  No, no, I'm not doing a, I don't have a bit here.  I don't have a bit here.  I'm just talking about it.  I don't have a bit.  So you got the iPad screens.  Yeah.  Well, you're, you're, you're, you're like, you're screwing yourself is all I'm saying.  Yeah.  There is no, but clearly it's not going anywhere where I'm going with it.  And that proves that Kennedy was shot. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  That proves Kennedy was shot.  I'll give you this, uh, Martin Luther King story.  I talked to James Earl Ray, the guy who killed Martin Luther King on the radio when I was  in Florida because he was looking for a kidney at the time while he was in prison.  So this producer I had hooked us up with him and we were talking to him and I said, well,  you know, when you killed Martin Luther King and he's like, dude, I never killed Martin  Luther King.  And we're like, well, uh, you know, obviously he goes, look, let me just tell you something. 
[03:05:30]  I've been in this prison for years.  All of these black guys are in here with me.  Like I'm walking around the yard and no one has ever killed me or hurt me because no one  in here thinks I did it.  Holy shit.  Everybody in here.  And man, I was like, I never even thought that never even occurred to me.  Yeah.  Wouldn't one fucking black dude, you know, well, you know, he didn't do it.  Who did it?  They don't have, they don't, they don't have the guy caught who did it, but the bullet came 
[03:06:00]  from a completely different or I just read the book, right?  So I know, I know information about this as of, as of yesterday.  So I'm not like a authority on this, but Richard Belzer is the bullet came from a completely  different direction.  Like he was staying in some hotel room across the street, but there's a photo of everybody  pointing at where, where the shot came from and they're pointing up at the top of another  building and the, the, the angle that the bullet hit MLK was completely different than  the angle.  Belzer, does Belzer believe that anything actually happened ever the way that they told us? 
[03:06:30]  Does he go, Oh yeah, that one, 9-11.  He didn't land on the moon.  Yeah.  No, no.  He, he, he believes they landed on the moon.  Yeah.  He does believe in the moon landing.  What about 9-11?  I don't believe we landed on the moon.  You don't?  No, I do actually.  What about the diamond planet?  The diamond planet.  I don't, I don't believe in the diamond planet.  Damn it.  You gotta believe.  That's all we got.  That's where Jim Jeffries met his new big mama, the diamond planet.  Diamond planet, guys, welcome.  I think he's gonna, I think he's gonna have a long, healthy relationship there.  Yeah, it's gonna, it's gonna be wonderful. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, it's gonna, it's gonna, it's gonna, so does Belzer think that all of these, that  the JFK and Martin Luther King and all, are they all related and related or are they?  I don't know.  I have to ask him about that, what the connection is.  Yeah.  I don't know.  But the angle of the, the bullet came from somewhere else is what they're saying.  Yeah.  From where they were pointing.  Angle of the bullet came from somewhere else.  Marilyn Monroe, also a big subject of the book, was, uh, was, uh, murdered.  Robert Kennedy visited her at her house the day she was murdered. 
[03:07:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Marilyn Monroe.  My only question there is why would he put himself so close to, you know, a situation like  that?  No, because he wasn't tight end.  It was other guys.  It was other people that didn't like him being around.  Wait, I'm confused now.  Some people think that.  I thought, I thought, I thought the Kennedys might have had something to do with that, to  shut her up.  Yeah.  I was taught growing up.  Yeah, that's what we were taught growing up, but the new theory is that the Kennedys,  Marilyn Monroe, Martin Luther King, they were all taken out in the same conspiracy. 
[03:08:00]  Hmm.  You know, maybe to blackmail civil rights.  Blackmail Kennedy.  So that, you know, because they knew that he was with Marilyn Monroe.  Supposedly they were in a relationship.  Mm-hmm.  JFK and RFK.  That's pretty.  Pretty wild.  Pretty wild.  Some wild stuff.  And the FBI had tapes on all those people fucking.  Like, they had taped bedrooms with Martin Luther King banging chicks.  You know those tapes are somewhere, still.  You know they are.  That we don't know. 
[03:08:30]  Basement of the White House.  I love the fucking hero.  Yeah, that would be amazing.  All that stuff will eventually be out there.  And then the weirdness of Teddy Kennedy's, you know, driving that chick off and all the  weirdness that happened there.  He had a career.  He went home soaking wet.  And he got away with anyone really fucking having a problem with it.  Well, no one saw him as a threat.  Who?  Who?  Who?  Teddy Kennedy.  Oh, yeah.  Youngest brother.  Yeah.  You drowned a bitch.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's right. 
[03:09:00]  And then Michael Jackson.  And then he swam to safety and then went home and then told everyone the next day.  Yeah.  See, we're not going to have any of those kind of stories from this decade.  Everyone's got their cameras.  Everyone's going to be like, oh, yeah, Clinton fucked a girl with a cigar.  Someone's going to have a video of Ted Kennedy all soaking wet walking down a highway.  You know what I mean?  They would now.  They would now.  You're not going to get away with that.  O.J. would have been, if you'd seen him running from the house, of course, no one  will ever be able to do anything again. 
[03:09:30]  Sandusky.  Everyone's on TV 24 hours a day.  Sandusky was, you know, if that happened today, they'd have some video of that, too.  That's sick fuck.  So what's pissing you off these days, Tom?  What's pissing you off?  That is a very good question, Tom Brady.  Explain Caroline's.  Wow.  What's pissing me off?  Halloween.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, is the Belzer book co-written by Jesse Ventura?  It's an afterword.  No, but he is the forward or the afterward. 
[03:10:00]  I was getting some intel because we think, you know, Jesse has lost his fucking mind.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's the thing, you know, when the only people that, you know, they have, you  know, out there trumpeting these things, I like Jesse Ventura.  I think he's pretty hilarious.  When I saw him on the Pierce Morgan show the other night and he was, it was a hilarious  interview.  You know, I mean, I'm not sure about the whole 9-11 thing.  Hilarious though.  Yeah.  The whole 9-11 thing is a little far-fetched for me, you know, but, uh, I know that there's 
[03:10:30]  a lot of people that, uh, think otherwise, but, uh, you know, that, that's where it gets  a little bit, uh, crazy for me.  The truther movement.  Well, the thing is, I know enough cops and firemen that they wouldn't keep it quiet.  Like all those guys were down there.  Right.  They all know how buildings fall.  Right.  I, I mean, I would believe that the federal, you know, government would lie about shit.  Of course.  But just guys on the job?  No.  Never.  That fucking their friends die?  Never.  No.  They would never keep their mouth shut.  Never. 
[03:11:00]  That's where it gets a little strange when you see Jesse Ventura on Pierce Morgan basically  talking about that being an inside job.  I think it gets strange when you see Jesse Ventura and then I saw him on Pierce Morgan  the whole time.  He's going Pierce Monsoon.  Look, Monsoon.  You don't know what you're talking about, Monsoon.  Like that was years ago, Jesse.  Come back.  Let it go.  Uh, you were asking Tom Popper questions.  I'm sorry.  I just got the intel on the Jesse Ventura.  Yeah, no, it's, you know, everything. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  What, what are you going to, what are you going to tell the people in Newfoundland?  I can't, you're going to have so much fun up there.  It's amazing.  Yeah, I'm excited to see those people.  Oh my gosh.  Newfoundland.  I've, I've always wanted to go there.  I've never been to Newfoundland.  That's weird.  It seems weird to me that it's the one province in Canada I've not been to.  It's quite isolated.  Yeah.  Very far north.  Right.  East coast.  It's a long flight up there.  Long flight.  It's very much like a different, uh, country.  It's almost like, uh, Ireland almost.  I hear they're very grateful people.  Yeah.  Very, very funny people. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  They like laughing.  Yeah.  Very, you're going to have a good time.  Yeah.  I think it'll be good.  What do you do up there?  Stand-up comedy.  You mean in between?  Yeah.  No.  What do you do up there, Tom?  Do you know?  Well, it's a lot of fishing.  Lobster.  Uh, you know, it's, it's, it's like, you know, it's sort of like a more, uh, rustic and remote  version of Cape Cod.  You know, there's, uh, you know, there's, uh, you know, there's, uh, fishing, uh, yeah.  It's cold up there always.  Cold, I'm sure.  Very cold water.  Always.  Yeah, always.  Beautiful scenery. 
[03:12:30]  Um, a lot of drinking, I think.  They think they like to drink up there.  They love drinking.  Yeah.  You can have a good time for sure.  And lobster.  They love lobster.  Every interview I did for the, for the gig, it's, well, I hope you like lobster.  Jesus.  It's in everything, right?  It's one of those places where it's in everything.  Yeah.  We were into Donnie Dumfrey a couple of years ago, who's this really fucking funny kid up  there that was like doing a rap thing all in Newfoundland.  I can't think of the song where I'd have Sam playing for you.  It had something with doing wheelies in it, but this kid was amazing. 
[03:13:00]  And he was like trying to start like a hip hop thing in, uh, in Newfoundland.  But everybody up there gets fucking loaded all the time, right?  I mean, that's their thing.  Newfie hip hop is Canadian.  That, that makes Canadian hip hop even seem hard.  I think I'm going to drink a lot on this tour.  Oh, yeah.  It'll definitely be, uh, it's, it's, it's, uh, is this him?  Yeah, it's him.  Having a time?  Yeah.  This is Newfie hip hop here?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  How do you know about this?  Well, I don't know.  Somebody sent it to us and we got obsessed with this kid. 
[03:13:30]  Is this as good as Gangnam Style?  No one?  Too new.  Oh, I've seen this.  I think I saw it on the iBag.  Yeah.  The kid's amazing.  TheiBag.com.  What are you all about?  Well, here it is.  What are you all about?  Is that real?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nice.  That's Newfoundland right there.  I'm not sure if the Newfie accent really works with, uh, hardcore street credibility. 
[03:14:00]  It doesn't add a lot to the hardcore street credibility.  No.  Donnie, Donnie, Donnie.  Brenda, what do you want?  Take us for a ride. 
[03:14:30]  Take us for a jump.  Honda 50.  Get her on the go.  Get her on the ground.  Yeah, this is horrible.  This is bad.  I don't want the back.  This, it looks like there hasn't been a new building in, uh, for forever.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to be drinking on this tour.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you are.  You're probably going to be drinking with this guy.  There's, I don't know.  Actually, I don't know.  I don't want to say it's horrible.  I mean, I don't know.  Maybe it's, maybe it's good.  Having a time.  Having a time.  Having a time. 
[03:15:00]  That's what I said.  I'm just having a time.  That's your club that you're going to be wearing it at.  Wow.  I want to go up there, though.  It looks like Bon Jovi fans.  Yeah, man.  That's going to be fun.  Type Newfoundland in there.  Let's maybe, maybe I see a, just, just, just look at some pictures.  They call them newfies.  Let's just look at some pictures of Newfoundland.  So you're going to get drunk with the newfies.  You're going to get drunk with the newfies.  You're going to get drunk with the newfies.  You're going to get drunk with the newfies.  You're going to get drunk with the newfies.  Newfie jokes.  Yeah, I don't really know any, but you can tell some.  You know, like in Canada, we do the how many newfies does it take to screw in a light bulb type of jokes. 
[03:15:30]  They do Polish jokes about Newfoundland.  About the newfies.  It's the Polish jokes we do with newfies.  So you could take any, any, any Polish joke.  Now you're just showing dogs.  So I should be like, what do they call the people on the, on the mainland?  Yeah.  Mainlanders.  Mainlanders.  So if I make jokes about the mainlanders, they'll be into it.  I want to go up there now.  Oh, a Newfoundland.  Oh, it's a dog.  I'm performing for a black dog.  That's a Labrador. 
[03:16:00]  Newfoundland Labrador is the, is, is, is the island.  Newfoundland is Labrador.  The Labrador Retriever, the black Labrador Retriever is from Newfoundland.  Wow.  There's a lot of rich history.  Yeah.  I'm realizing I don't know nearly enough about Newfoundland.  You kind of brought this up, Tom.  The country that I'm from.  They have dogs there.  Usually when you bring something up, people have a little knowledge about it.  People and houses.  They eat food.  They eat a lot of food. 
[03:16:30]  Ronnie saved us with that song.  But it's going to be an exciting tour.  Halifax, of course.  I like Halifax.  The Cabot Trail.  But you're not even going to go.  The storm's going to hit, and you're done.  You have to cancel this gig, unfortunately.  Frankenstorm doesn't stop the party bus.  Halifax was nearly leveled in World War II or I  by the largest explosion in the history of the non-nuclear explosion 
[03:17:00]  in the history of a munitions ship in the harbor  exploded in Halifax Harbor.  Hilarious.  And leveled the entire city.  Could make some jokes about that.  Wow.  The Titanic people were dropped off in Halifax still.  True.  The survivors from Newfoundland.  There were 9-11 flights that were diverted to Newfoundland.  This is all great material for you.  The Trailer Park Boys are from Halifax.  My friend Mike Bubbles is in New York right now. 
[03:17:30]  And we're going to go out and drink with Bubbles from the Trailer  Park Boys tonight after my show at Caroline's.  But you're coming back as I see you're...  Yeah.  Will you be taking the audience with you?  Does the audience get to go out and drink with Bubbles?  Yeah, I think I will ask them to come out.  Yeah.  What is your audience?  What are they like?  They're just sort of a bunch of people.  You know, nice people.  Nice people.  Like Newfoundland people.  It's sort of an interesting group of people that come out to my shows, actually. 
[03:18:00]  It's a lot of different types of people.  People that are from the MTV show.  People that watch my videos on YouTube.  Right.  My new YouTube page.  Any fans of your blog?  Some blog fans.  Yeah.  It's kind of an interesting mix of people that have been coming to my shows, though.  I've got like...  That's good.  I've got like...  You know, there's a broad range of ages, you know?  Sizes?  Are they bigger than most?  Yeah.  The big people?  I don't really know.  Like, I don't know.  Everyone seems to have fun, though. 
[03:18:30]  It's been pretty fun.  Right.  A lot of drinking.  A lot of drinking going on.  I can see that.  You guys want to hear from some newfies?  Yeah.  I'd love to hear from them.  You sure?  We haven't talked to them in a while.  They listen.  Travis, what's up?  Hey, buddy.  How you doing, Hopi?  Yeah, what's up, man?  Oh, first time.  A lot of time.  Any questions?  Good news from I am?  That's where I'm from.  Oh, yeah.  Their cell service is really bad.  Oh, listen to that.  Yeah.  I remember this from last time we took calls from them.  The phones don't work as well up there.  No, they don't.  Oh, no.  It's like they're calling from the space station. 
[03:19:00]  Travis, what do you got?  Oh, I was just calling in.  If there was any questions you wanted to know that you can land for drinking wise, yeah.  I mean, fuck, we're going to have a party.  Everybody goes down there in the summer.  It's the best time to go.  August 1st.  August long weekend or whatnot.  Well, I guess...  Wait, there's one weekend where people can go outside?  Yeah, that's the warm weekend.  Is that what he was getting?  Yeah, they love it.  What's the weather like right now?  Oh, terrible, terrible, terrible.  It's all everywhere.  It's got 27 meters in Alford, and I think you've got to be the same... 
[03:19:30]  Did you say 27 meters?  27 meters.  That's a lot.  That's a lot in our...  That's a lot in feet.  27 meters is impossible, right?  Time could end up being trapped there until the spring.  Yeah.  Until the fall.  They have the Frankenstorm, like, every day there.  All right, let me go to Patrick there, Travis.  Thank you.  Patrick also in Newfoundland.  Nice. 
[03:20:00]  Patrick, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  No, it's a great province.  You know, you were saying you've got to pop up.  It's a beautiful place.  Summertime is gorgeous.  Listen to that accent.  When is summertime?  Sounds great.  That's what I need to know.  June to probably the end of September is gorgeous.  No, no, no.  It's like Ireland.  You're basically going to Ireland.  It's that close, and it does sound...  The accent reminds me of it.  That's very Irish, yeah.  But I lived in Western New York, and summer wasn't June through late September. 
[03:20:30]  When is summer, summer up there?  July, August.  There you go.  Okay.  All right.  That's when it's really nice.  Right.  How are the cod biting this year?  Pretty good.  Pretty delicious.  You club any baby seals lately?  No, just a big one.  How's the baby seal clubbing going?  Are they known for that a little bit up there?  That's where most of the seals are beaten to a cold.  Tom's going to be spray-pending them, so they'll be you.  I'm bringing my club. 
[03:21:00]  I'm bringing my club.  Is there still lobster season?  Can you still eat lobster?  Oh, yeah.  There's lots of lobster.  You can get lots of lobster when you're up there.  But we usually go with codfish.  Codfish is delicious.  Codfish fritters?  Codfish overrated, sir.  Sorry.  No, no, no, no.  It's delicious.  Salmon, tuna.  Nice.  How are the women?  Some of those Mediterranean fishes.  What are the women like up there?  The women are beautiful here.  Per capita, we have a lot of beautiful, gorgeous women here.  Are they big?  Big ladies?  No, they're not big. 
[03:21:30]  They wear little, tiny outfits, and they are fine to call wetter.  So it's pretty good.  What a great accent.  What is that?  Well, because they're so close to Ireland and England, it's kind of like that Atlantic thing.  What's the flight to Ireland from there?  No, I don't know.  Three and a half hours.  How long?  What?  It's a long.  About three hours, three and a half hours.  That's like going to Florida for us.  They're an hour ahead of us.  Yeah, that's like where my ancestors came from as Ireland.  Yeah.  What time is it there right now?  It's 11.30. 
[03:22:00]  See?  Hour and a half?  I thought you were joking.  They add a half hour.  It's the one 30-minute time zone.  That's how weird it is in Newfoundland.  I'm not getting mine from running.  This is going to be a weird trip.  It's a 30-minute.  Wait, it's an hour and a half ahead?  Hour and a half ahead.  It's so fucked up.  Yeah.  I'm going to fire my agent.  I learned something new on it.  You have to be right to, dude.  It's actually its own time zone.  You've got Eastern Standard Time, and then you've got Newfoundland Standard Time.  Wow.  How do you watch TV? 
[03:22:30]  Do they have lunch?  Do you guys have lunch?  We have lunch at 12 o'clock.  12 o'clock?  What time's supper?  5 o'clock.  5?  Oh, an early supper.  Now, how much snow is on the ground?  The other guy said meters.  I don't think that was right.  Yeah, I was listening to him.  I'm living in St. John's.  There's no snow here right now.  It's a little overcast today.  A little foggy.  It's 10 degrees.  10 degrees.  You've got to come to my show.  I'm going to be there.  Oh, yeah.  No, me and my girl already got tickets for us.  Oh, groovy.  Oh, wow.  How cool is that?  You've got fans up there, Tom. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, that'll be fun.  We're going to have lobster at supper.  5?  You've got to get screeched in, too.  When you come to Newfoundland, you've got to get screeched in to become an official newfie.  What's that mean?  I don't know what that is.  You've got to say a poem.  You've got to do a shot of screech.  And you've got to kiss a codfish.  Yeah.  What is screech like?  What screech?  Is it like whiskey?  It's a rum.  It's a really dark rum.  Dark rum.  Yeah, I'm glad I'm an oofie, so I don't have to drink it.  It's funny.  Like, Jamaica is into codfish and rum.  And this is like the cold version. 
[03:23:30]  And poems.  This is the cold version.  Say a poem.  Say a poem.  And say a poem?  Oh, yeah.  You've got to say like a little limerick.  Can you pick your poem or you've got to try to fucking write one of those things?  No, no.  There's a special one you've got to read.  Oh, okay.  So should I bring a codfish on stage and screech?  You could get screeched in right on stage.  That'd be wicked.  All right.  I'm going to do that.  You guys do wicked up there, huh?  Yeah.  Well, I do anyway.  My body's...  Oh, wicked.  Yeah, wicked.  That's a Canadian thing for sure there, eh?  Yeah, wicked. 
[03:24:00]  Wicked.  When I was up in Boston, it was a big Boston thing, too.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Boston took it from these guys.  They're like that.  Wicked is something that...  Boston is like the Led Zeppelin of places.  Just taking from everybody.  Yeah.  This is a Blind Lemon Pledge.  Well, this sounds great.  I'm looking forward to it.  They have cities up there.  I don't even know.  St. John's.  Is it a city city, though?  No.  It's a...  St. John's.  We're the biggest city in Newfoundland.  Small city.  Small city.  3,000 people.  Tall buildings?  How tall are the buildings?  Two stories.  Two stories.  All right.  Two stories. 
[03:24:30]  No, we have some big ones.  Nothing like down in New York or anything like that.  You got some triple deckers?  Yeah, we got a few big ones.  Nothing too crazy.  What's the tallest building in St. John's?  IHOP.  An IHOP.  It's a pointy roof.  The pointy roof.  Pointy levels, maybe?  20 levels.  20...  20 levels.  That's it.  That's like two floors, Tess.  It is.  Yeah.  Yeah, no, we're not...  Downtown is beautiful, though.  George Street.  It has the most connected bears.  The whole street is...  Bears?  Did you say bears? 
[03:25:00]  Yes.  We're scared of bears in America.  Factor, do you know Donnie Dumfrey up there?  Yeah, we are.  We've watched Donnie a lot.  You meet him every now and again downtown.  See, I'm telling you, that's the guy that you need to hook up with.  Is he the biggest star in St. John's?  They call him the Bob Hope.  We have a few stars here from St. John's.  He's good, though.  He's a great comedian.  What other big stars?  We usually stick to the hockey mostly.  We have a few now in the NHL and stuff, so that's pretty good.  That's good.  But what about... 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, what about music or any of the...  Yeah, movies, any of that shit?  Music's hard to break out.  There's a band from here now.  Hey, Rosetta, if you haven't heard of them, they're awesome.  You should really check.  Are they the biggest band ever to come from your area?  The biggest band?  Probably Great Big Sea, I would think.  Wow, no clue.  Do they like...  Big in Canada.  They like Spoon there.  Big in Canada, yeah.  It's almost like Irish-sounding music.  Yeah, they kind of got an Irish time, but they're a good band.  You know, they do a good thing.  They've done well doing it. 
[03:26:00]  All right, Ronnie's putting his coat on, so I think it's time to go.  Yeah, it's time to wrap it up.  Ronnie knows when it's time to wrap up.  Well, thanks for the call, though.  I'm excited to come up.  Oh, yeah, look forward to seeing the show, and best of luck, and all the best.  How are you doing?  Love hearing the show.  All right, thanks.  Thank you, sir.  I'll be there for...  All right, bud.  Bye-bye.  I'll be there for like three months.  You're going to come back with a big fucking beard and some kind of animal pelt.  I'll be coming in with screech.  With a fucking seal over your shoulder.  Hey, guys, you suck that bad. 
[03:26:30]  It's not that bad clubbing these things.  We'll be fucking hanging around with Big C and the fucking Rosetta Stone.  I'll be sending you videos.  All right.  Well, Tom, thank you so much.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  It was fun coming in here.  Anything else you're promoting?  For the full run.  No, but go to the Comedy Cellar website and come to Papa Live on November 13th for free  here in great New York City with Jimmy Norton.  And that's all I'm really plugging.  That and if you guys want to head up to Newfoundland. 
[03:27:00]  God, I would love to.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Can we do that?  Yeah.  I got two kids now.  Get a cooler and come on up.  My girl wouldn't allow it.  She would say cool.  Get out before the Frankenstorm.  It'll be safe up there.  They know how to prepare for it.  How many days you're up there for?  I don't know.  A quick weekend up there?  How cool would that be, Ron?  Yeah, but after the Frankenstorm is the mummy storm.  It's going to be bad weather.  We're really in bad weather.  We're going to roll right into the mummy storm?  Yeah, we're in bad weather.  Yeah, I know.  It's all.  You've got to get your traveling in the next couple weeks, then it's over. 
[03:27:30]  Vampire storm.  Yeah, I would love to go up there.  Yeah, it'll be fun.  Not this time with the Frankenstorm.  Maybe in the summer.  Yeah, I'll.  How about you book it in the summer?  I'll book something in the summer.  Like August?  The problem is you can't do summer shows in places like this because that's when they're  outside.  They don't want to go to a show.  Now it's starting to get depressing.  They want to go see comedy.  Yeah.  You figured that out a long time ago.  Yeah, you go to Minneapolis and do a show in January.  It's going to be great.  Go in June.  Guaranteed, right?  You're by yourself.  June, not so much?  Yeah.  That's another place I want to go. 
[03:28:00]  It's a good city.  Jimmy's got the anti-social up there in a week or two.  I wanted to go to that.  It's a good city for sure.  Is it really?  I don't know shit about Minneapolis.  Yeah, Minneapolis is great.  It's one of the better cities for sure.  Yeah.  Clean?  Clean living up there?  Clean living.  The people are, you know, the weather's bad enough where they're a little jaded and  have a good sense of humor, but they're good, solid people.  It's good.  The girls are big hips.  You'd like it.  It's like Canada, Minneapolis.  It's like Canada.  They play hockey up there.  Yeah, they do.  They like their hockey.  It's like Canada. 
[03:28:30]  I'm going to be in Baltimore.  Nice.  I'm going to be in Philly at Helium.  Nice.  And Ohio.  I'm doing a little run through Ohio, and I'm going to Detroit to Royal Oak, Michigan,  and this weekend at Carolinas.  That's where I'm going.  Wow.  You're all over.  I'm running all around.  I'm going all around.  Where's your dates?  TomGreen.com?  TomGreen.com.  You click on the little tour thing at the top of the page, and you can get all the dates  on there.  Yeah, I'm excited about it.  Can you buy merch?  You can buy merch.  I'll be selling some t-shirts.  Come buy a t-shirt.  That'd be good.  Have a beer. 
[03:29:00]  Buy a t-shirt.  I'm a big fan of your videos, by the way, Tom Green.  Yeah, and I...  Always have been.  Everyone, if you...  I'm putting all my old videos on my new YouTube page.  YouTube slash Tom Green.  Go look at that.  What's YouTube?  It's this new thing that you can take videos.  If I knew that YouTube was going to exist when I did half of that stuff that I did on my  old show, I probably would have pulled a few punches, I think.  Yeah.  Wow, the views you would have forgotten if you got on that early.  I probably would not have humped the dead moose, though, if I knew that it would be able 
[03:29:30]  to be pulled up at a moment's notice by any future employer.  Those shows you did, Tom, are timeless, man.  You can still watch the Tom Green show.  I'm having fun going through all the archives right now.  I've got a lot of stuff that's never really been seen in years, and a lot of it that never  aired on MTV, and I'm just putting it all up on the YouTube.  Your parents doing well?  Yeah, they're doing great.  Yeah, they're doing real good.  They're retired.  We could call them right now if you want. 
[03:30:00]  You want to call my mom?  Yeah, I'll call your mom.  You want to call her and see how she's doing?  Ron, you want to stick around for the Tom Green mom call?  Love it.  You don't have to.  I'll write her number down.  She's got a very busy day.  Want to call her?  I'm going to be sitting right here.  What are we going to say to your mom?  She'll be.  She's probably listening right now on the internet.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What's the internet?  Yeah.  Where do you find YouTube?  I'm preparing myself for a new phone number.  That's how weird the world's getting is now that everything's programmed in these phones.  I don't remember anybody's phone number. 
[03:30:30]  I forget who my parents are from time to time.  How can I not remember?  I know my wife's cell phone.  I don't even know the house number that I have.  That's 23.  23.  Thank you.  Apartment 6F.  But then again, I could tell you my first number from college, dumb numbers like that  from Ray Wade long ago.  Yeah.  I wonder.  If you want to call my mom and ask her about the slut mobile or anything like that?  What's the slut mobile?  That was when I painted the –  Oh, the famous slut mobile from the TV show. 
[03:31:00]  Of course, yes.  That's on the video there where I painted the –  Yeah.  I thought you might have had a new slut mobile.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  I still have the hood of the slut mobile hanging in the wall in my garage.  But that's it right there in the video right there.  That's the slut mobile.  But yeah.  I told my mom we might call this morning.  Well, we could do that.  I mentioned – I thought it might be fun to call and see how she's doing.  They live on a lake.  Oh, really?  They live on a lake in Canada and they just kind of are retired and they golf and don't  really do much, really. 
[03:31:30]  I think they really –  Retirement sounds awful.  Trying to encourage them to get out there and get a job there, eh?  Retirement seems to smell weird.  I just always picture it smelling like milk.  Old milk or no?  Old.  Oh, okay.  Because fresh would be great.  Fresh milk.  Well, that's the beginning of retirement.  And then a couple weeks in, I'm just –  More like soy milk or whole milk or what?  What are we talking?  Fat-free.  Fat.  The real stuff.  Yeah, the real – just nice, solid whole milk. 
[03:32:00]  What's your mom's name?  Mary Jane.  Mary Jane Green.  Yo, Mary Jane.  Mary Jane Green.  I know.  What a name.  I'm weed all over.  What's up, Mary Jane?  We got your son in studio.  This is Opie.  We got Tom Papa and the great Ron Bennington.  Oh, hi, everybody.  Were you listening to the show today?  I was.  And then our connection's in the car.  And then my husband took off with it to go golfing.  So I listened until about 15 minutes ago. 
[03:32:30]  Wait, what do you mean?  You were listening in the car?  Yeah, with my coffee.  Really?  Yeah, really.  How's it in the car?  On the –  On the radio in the car, but we don't have it in the car.  Oh, I see.  We have it when we drive.  So she's got satellite radio.  You've got the satellite radio in the car.  You've got to sit in the driveway.  Very cool.  So you're not listening to it on the internet.  You're listening to it in the car.  That's neat to think of you out there in the –  Oh, can I listen to it on the internet?  No, I guess not, probably.  I don't know.  What's the internet?  I just assumed you were listening to it on the internet, but – 
[03:33:00]  Wait, where do they –  I just did – I didn't – I wasn't visualizing you sitting out in the car with your coffee  in the woods.  That's his first appearance on the radio.  Yeah, that's a good mom right there.  That almost makes me feel kind of bad, mom, that you would go –  But that's a good mom supporting you.  No, thank you, mom.  You're welcome.  For listening in the car.  My mom's talking to a wall somewhere, Tom, so you should appreciate this.  You really should appreciate it.  What area do they live in that your dad's golfing? 
[03:33:30]  They're in Quebec, just outside of the city of Ottawa, in the province of Quebec, French  part of Canada.  Beautiful.  In the woods.  There's bears.  Yeah, jeez.  There's moose.  On a lake, it's lovely.  Seen any bears lately?  No, actually, we haven't, but they're out there.  Are there mooses?  Lots of deer.  Lots of deer.  Not a lot of moose in our area.  I don't think deer and moose like to live together.  People often ask me if you guys are angry at me still because of all the shenanigans. 
[03:34:00]  No, it's ancient history talk.  See, everything's fine, right?  Everything's cool.  Yeah.  Well, isn't that why they got a house on a lake somewhere?  No, no.  Did they make their own money?  They bought the house, yeah.  And we didn't leave a forwarding address.  Yeah.  What was the one Tom Green stunt that really drove you nuts out of all of them?  Mm-hmm.  Um, maybe when he painted my car.  Oh, the Slutmobile?  Yeah.  No, there's actually ones that you actually are more angry about than that one, Mom. 
[03:34:30]  You're just not saying it because you don't want to say it on the radio.  Absolutely, Tom.  Wow, really?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  There are some that she is very, very, very angry about.  Worse than the Slutmobile.  Why?  Worse than the Slutmobile, yeah.  What could have been worse?  Mother?  Well, you know Tom.  Well, you know Tom.  There are certain segments that we did that, to this day, she is very angry about.  To this day?  She doesn't like to talk about them. 
[03:35:00]  Uh, and I, I wasn't actually planning on doing this, but it sort of seems kind of funny right  now because I can tell that you're a little bit, uh...  Ho, ho, ho, ho.  Wait, you guys actually don't talk about this, do you?  Well, I mean, you know, there was, uh, there was just certain bits that, that she did get  angrier about.  Um, it was really, why were you so angry about certain bits, though, at the end of the day?  Um, well, they were somewhat disrespectful.  Disrespectful, yeah.  Oh, boy. 
[03:35:30]  And that's, that's why we don't talk about them.  You guys really don't talk about them.  Yeah, but, uh, you got to go on Oprah.  Yes, we did.  Got to meet Oprah.  Because of you?  Yeah.  Because of your son?  Yeah.  Yes, that's true.  She sent you to Tahiti.  She did.  And that's why you signed the release form, that allowed me to air the bit that you didn't  like.  Yeah, I hadn't really made that connection.  Wait, she would allow...  Well, because after this one particular bit, which I won't talk about specifics, but anybody  who remembers the bit will remember that when we aired the bit, Dad, I had just moved to 
[03:36:00]  New York, and to do, the show just started, and we went back to Ottawa, and we filmed this  particular bit that you're angry about.  And, uh, and, uh, Dad called MTV and left a message and said that, uh, if we aired that  bit, he was going to sue you bastards for one million dollars.  So, uh, I'm sure Viacom was pretty concerned about that million dollar...  I'm sure they were very scared. 
[03:36:30]  So I had, I had, I had, we weren't allowed to air the bit, because you were going to sue  us bastards for one million dollars, right?  Right, right, right.  And then that was, that was when everything was kind of popping with the show, and, and,  uh, and it was very exciting, and Oprah, uh, invited, uh, my parents and I to go on,  on Oprah and, and play the Slutmobile and some of the other sort of tamer, tamer bits that  had already aired, because it was for their Mother's Day special, and Oprah wanted me to 
[03:37:00]  come on and apologize to my parents.  And I'd been living in America for, like, three weeks at this point or something, so  it was all very odd and crazy.  So we go down to Oprah, and I had the release form in my back pocket, knowing that maybe  the Oprah energy might soften you down, and you'd sign the release form, and we could air  the bit.  And, uh...  It worked.  It worked, but then what really happened was...  But she didn't know what she was signing, I would assume.  No, no, what happened was, on the show, on Oprah, uh, Oprah sent my parents... 
[03:37:30]  You know how she always surprises people and gives people cars and stuff, right?  Well, this was, I think, the first...  She sent my parents to Tahiti, she said you guys...  On Oprah.  Oprah said, I'm to apologize, I'm sending you guys on a 16-day cruise to Tahiti, right?  You had fun in Tahiti, right?  We did have fun, yes, we did.  Thank you, Oprah.  And then after we went out and had dinner, and you had the knowledge of this Tahiti trip,  and I asked you to sign the release form, because Oprah thought the pranks on the parents 
[03:38:00]  were funny, and you signed it and went to Tahiti.  Yes, we did.  Which, uh...  And it was worth it, right?  For that bit?  Yeah, because we were kind of worried that if we didn't, you might end up back in the  basement at home.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Living.  Can I make a guess of which one it was?  Mom, can we guess?  Well, Tom, you know.  You can't.  I know, I'm not going to guess.  Did it have to do with a statue?  Yeah.  Probably.  That was the one. 
[03:38:30]  That was the one.  That was a funny one.  The domestic abuse statue?  That was the jailbreaker right there.  The domestic abuse.  That's a little worse than the Slipmobile.  Yeah.  This is great.  A little bit closer to the truth?  Is that what happened there?  You know what?  Suddenly now?  That was the one.  Yeah.  Did she not like your description of it?  Now, let's ask Mary Jane.  Why did that one bother you, knowing that most people would know it's some kind of goofy  joke from your son?  Well, you know, I don't know that people do know that things are, I mean, people kind 
[03:39:00]  of got mixed up between truth and fiction, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a lot of lines blurred there.  And you guys really just don't talk about this one, huh?  Well, no, we'll talk about it privately, but not on the radio.  Right.  But I just figured that would be kind of a fun thing to throw out there, just to kind  of throw at you.  But you guys got past this, Mary Jane?  Can you tell?  The other one that I was the most surprised that you were really angry at me about was, 
[03:39:30]  and was the first one that you got really angry about, was when I showed up, and we  used to wake my parents up at 3 o'clock in the morning all the time.  I remember.  Very funny, by the way, Mary Jane.  More realistic, authentic reactions in the middle of the night.  But when I brought the decapitated cow's head and put it in your bed.  That was so gross.  That one you were very, very angry about.  Yeah, I thought I was going to throw up.  I didn't see what the big deal was about that one. 
[03:40:00]  I thought it was kind of, I thought you would have been impressed with the sort of creativity  of it.  How did you find that cow head or whatever?  You were really angry about that one.  Yes, well, very creative, Tom.  Your mom sounds really sweet.  Yeah.  She's trying to...  Does she make a good pie?  Does she make good pies?  There's the cow head there on the video, yeah.  There's the cow head.  I'm putting the decapitated cow's head in your bed.  And, you know, Tom, when you wake someone up in the middle of the night, it's, you know, 
[03:40:30]  you're not thinking, oh, wow, how creative someone is.  You're thinking...  No, but it was the next day that you were really...  You didn't talk to me for three days.  You were angry.  I was surprised that it really sort of stuck with you for that long.  Did you like it any better when Bam Margera did the same bits a few years later or did that help  at all?  Same.  What do you think, Mom?  What do you think of that?  I think you guys were much funnier than Bam Margera's parents. 
[03:41:00]  Oh, wait.  I thought that wasn't done before.  Well, did you always know that you had a...  Mary Jane, did you always know you had a weirdo in the house or what?  Well, there were a few of them.  The dog.  Dad and...  Yeah, Dad's a weirdo, too.  They're all pretty weird.  Yeah.  Do you have siblings, Tom Green?  Yeah, the younger brother, Joe, yeah.  Was he in on some of this stuff?  Not so much. 
[03:41:30]  He just sort of observed.  Quiet.  Yeah.  Quiet what?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're watching the video now on my new YouTube channel, Mom.  What's YouTube?  Oh, really?  It's on the new YouTube channel, YouTube slash Tom Green.  You can subscribe and watch me putting the decapitated cow's head in your bed here.  You have to sit in the driveway for it.  Yeah.  What happened to the comforter, Mary Jane?  I think Monica Lewinsky took it. 
[03:42:00]  That's right.  Oh, the famous Monica Lewinsky episode.  I forgot about that.  That was the last bit, actually, that I did with my parents because I realized they were  becoming jaded to these surprises when they didn't even know we were in town.  We walked into their bedroom at 3 o'clock in the morning with Monica Lewinsky.  And you had her on your show when she was fucking messed up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I forgot about that.  She was dating one of the writers on my show.  I believe they were dating or something like that. 
[03:42:30]  And so she agreed to come up to Ottawa with us.  And we had the media sort of on a wild goose chase, chasing us around because we were going  to make an announcement, right?  The announcement was that she was starting a handbag company.  So we were there looking for fabric.  That was a stupid announcement.  But we had literally the international media came out.  It was fun.  They thought you were getting engaged.  Yeah, we were sort of psyching them out to think that we were getting engaged.  But yeah, then when we walked into your bedroom at 4 o'clock in the morning and dad leaned 
[03:43:00]  up and he just looked at us and he said, oh, hey, Monica, how you doing?  Wasn't surprised.  Nothing.  Was he hoping for something?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Mom?  I don't know.  I hope not.  You field that question.  You field that one.  Well, we love your son there, Mary Jane.  Oh, well, thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks, Mom.  Thanks for listening, Mom.  Okay.  Have fun in New York.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  Bye.  This was a fun show. 
[03:43:30]  You're out.  Tom Papa's out.  All right.  Good to see you, man.  You too, Tom.  Have fun in Newfoundland.  All right.  Thanks, man.  All right, man.  Awesome.  Enjoy your tour.  Yeah, absolutely.  Thank you, Tom.  Does anyone want this scotch that Ron White gave me?  It's a blended scotch whiskey.  Oh, man.  Well, you don't drink or you don't drink?  I don't really drink scotch.  I mean, I drink some scotch, but.  I don't know if I.  Do you want this as a gift?  Are you sure?  Are you sure?  Put it in your hotel room.  Just for the New York.  Are you sure you don't want it?  From one comedian to another.  I'd feel bad not taking it after that. 
[03:44:00]  Thank you very much.  Very nice.  Is this real?  That's right.  Is this real?  That's a real interaction?  Yeah, it's nice.  It's so strange.  You sure you don't want to drink that?  No, yeah.  It's all yours.  It's a big deal.  Do you have to drink it right now?  We're doing scotch.  We're gentlemen.  That's how gentlemen act.  Toast.  Honestly, the real reason I'm hesitating is because I'm trying to cut back on the booze,  and now I know that I'm fucked.  That's from Ron White, who's made drinking pretty legendary in his act.  Yeah, absolutely.  That's amazing.  Is that what he drinks?  That's what he drinks. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, fuck.  Ron White knows the good shit.  Yeah.  How do you think he's going to feel about you just giving it away, though?  I mean, he gave it to you.  He'll never know.  You don't think he'll hear about that?  He gave me a cigar, too.  I kept the cigar.  Okay, yeah.  It's re-gifting.  It's okay.  It's re-gifting.  It happens in America.  He'll be happy that it's doing another comedian.  If it was, you know, just some guy on the street, he wouldn't be so happy about it.  Maybe I'll give it to Richard Belzer.  He'll be like, you know what?  This bottle of black grouse will just be making the rounds around New York City.  As a matter of fact, it was Oswald.  Eventually, it'll come back to Tom Popper. 
[03:45:00]  You're going to get that bottle back one day.  All right.  Good hanging with you guys.  Thanks, Tom.  Take it easy.  I guess we'll wrap up.  Tom Green, Caroline's Tom Green on YouTube.  You'll see all the old videos and the new videos.  I'm a fan of the new shit, too.  Yeah.  I'm having fun with my camera.  And one of the first guys to start that whole podcasting phenomenon.  Yeah.  I'm starting a new podcast soon.  But, I mean, you were doing it.  You were doing it in your house way before anyone else was.  Yeah.  I'm excited about the new one because it's just going to be audio.  I'm not going to put the cameras on it right away.  You're sick of the TV angle?  So, I like that there's – you don't have cameras here, right? 
[03:45:30]  No.  I like that there's not cameras here.  I'm glad you didn't discover any of the ones we got.  Or they are hidden away somewhere.  Well, maybe.  You never know what you're going to say.  Oh, yeah.  I like the theater of the mind.  Yeah.  It's nice to be on the radio and just be –  Where the audience paints the pictures.  Yeah.  You're not worried about what you look like.  Or, oh, look how old he's getting.  You know, that's what people say when they look at my web show.  Oh, my God.  He's getting old, man.  The comments got to you. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  You know, I'd rather – I think I'm just going to hide behind a microphone.  No cameras.  Nice.  I'm going to see it, Caroline.  In the podcast.  Maybe tonight I see Tom Green.  Awesome.  I'm going to try to get –  Hang out with Bubbles.  Hang out with Bubbles.  Yeah, the late show.  Bubbles will be there.  Pretty sure he's come to the late show.  Who's Bubbles again?  Trailer Park, boys.  Trailer Park, boys.  Ah, the trailer park.  Yeah.  Of course.  We're going to have some – probably drink the scotch after the show.  I'll bring the scotch to the show.  Drink the scotch.  All right.  And, Ron, thank you so much, buddy.  I'll see you in a half an hour.  I know.  I'm sorry.  But you could have taken the day off.  Let Fezzy fucking take the stick. 
[03:46:30]  He is ready.  I think today might be the day he takes the stick.  Fezzy takes the stick.  Ron goes home.  Okay.  No one's going to complain.  I love the way the show just kind of goes until you just kind of decide to end it.  Like, there's no –  Yeah, there's no –  No real time, right?  It just kind of goes.  There was probably three other times we probably should have ended the show.  But we got Rolling Stones stuff up on the iBang today from last night.  Theibang.com.  It's a great website.  Theibang.com.  Clips from the Rolling Stones last night.  Nice, really?  Everybody's sending them in.  I'll check that out.  They're brought up about it, yeah.  You getting a piece of that action over there? 
[03:47:00]  Everything's going well for everybody.  Everybody's doing good here.  Everybody's doing good there.  Yeah, Tom's doing good.  We're all doing good.  Tom Papa's on his way up.  Joe DeRose is buying fucking can good somewhere.  Joe DeRose is going great.  Everybody's doing good.  He's getting his cooler and his batteries, preparing for the big storm.  We got to get into Joe DeRose one day.  I want to dig.  I want to dig into that brain of his one day.  Something going on there.  We've only scratched the surface.  He's not ready for this.  He's way too sensitive.  He's not ready for the – 
[03:47:30]  He can't be a public figure.  No?  No, he's too sensitive.  Too sensitive.  All right.  We're babbling.  Tom's right.  Ronnie, thank you.  Have a good weekend.  See you Monday.  Bye.  The Opie and Anthony Show is pretty much over.  This show will be available later today with SiriusXM on demand.  After ONA Live is next.  SiriusXM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues.  This is After ONA Live. 
[03:48:00]  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  We're back.  Kelly Festooka's here.  Hey, mate.  You remember her.  She's on the You Know What Dude podcast.  Oh, boy.  She almost ruined intern Anthony's life.  The mistress of intern Anthony.  Yeah.  Did you hear that one?  Almost bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It doesn't really bother you, does it?  Unless someone's going to stab me.  I don't mind.  Opie and Tom Green are here.  Opie and Tom Green are here. 
[03:48:30]  Turn from this.  Oh, you know what they're doing?  What?  Exchanging viral video tips.  This is like the Kings meeting.  You know what I mean?  This is, and they're talking about the cameras they use.  The Kings are in court.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, this is like, Kelly, just for you and I to be here to witness this, it's quite  a feat because.  I don't think I'm allowed to have your level of sarcasm.  I'm not that in with the group yet.  See, the thing is, nobody knows when, you know, people assume it's sarcastic, but then 
[03:49:00]  they're like, maybe he's not being sarcastic.  Like, but maybe he is.  You're not, your sarcasm is not even like sarcasm.  It's more like just poking the bear.  Like, you just see an opportunity where things can get fucked up and you're like, poke, poke,  poke, poke, poke, poke, poke.  Really, Anthony?  I think your girlfriend would have a problem with it.  Boom.  Destruction's possible.  Yeah.  He was looking good this morning.  Oh, you're starting again.  You're learning.  What are they learning over there? 
[03:49:30]  I don't know.  You're closer than I am.  And, um, uh, it looks like, I don't know, for some reason in my head, it's going to  that, uh, remember that Turtle Man show?  Mm-hmm.  Like, uh.  Which Turtle Man show?  Love action.  What?  No.  Yeah.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  Turtle Man.  It was like, it was like a, it was like a crocodile hunter guy.  Okay.  But it was like American and was like, you know, a red state guy.  Uh-huh.  And would find turtles.  Yeah.  And that's it?  Yeah.  When was that on?  Well, I don't know.  It was on one of those discovery shows, but it was like, he was really like, like, live in a shack 
[03:50:00]  without any electricity, no running water.  He was one of those crazy guys.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sure somebody must know what you're talking about.  Definitely, yeah.  Definitely not as sexy as Bear Grylls.  But that's what you think is going on over there?  Yeah.  There's a lot of hicks in hats and long hairs and, uh, not a lot of teeth.  Not a lot of dentistry.  No?  In the, uh, I don't know what it is.  D.R.I.?  I don't know what it is.  I should tell, well, they're distracted because they'll interrupt me.  Yeah.  I should tell you, uh, you're a woman.  I am.  And-  Thank you for noticing.  I really appreciate it. 
[03:50:30]  Oh, my God.  I didn't notice last time.  I really- thank you so much.  But this time I got it.  I really appreciate that.  And I've heard that if you ask any woman what the best gift they ever got was-  Oh, God, I hate this already.  Sorry.  Without hesitation.  Without even thinking about it, she'll always say her engagement ring.  Mm, mm.  I know I endure my engagement ring.  You love it.  Yeah.  Hasn't happened, huh?  That's okay.  I don't know.  The one-  You know, the one thing I did right besides marry my wife- 
[03:51:00]  What was that, Sam?  What did you do?  Oh, my God.  I'm going to be the hole.  What do you do?  Oh, my God.  What happened?  It says right here, I got her a great engagement ring.  You are so sweet.  Oh, my God.  It's already grating.  Don't be kidding.  You've got to stop doing that.  It's so important.  It's not just a ring.  It's not just a sign of affection.  It's everything to her.  Every time she washes her hands-  Identify it.  That's Tom Green and Opie talking.  Every time someone at the store sees-  You know, every time anybody sees her hands, whether she's giving a hand job, whether she's 
[03:51:30]  doing the dishes, whether, you know, whatever, people notice the ring.  And it's her time to show it off, Kelly.  That's what I'm saying.  You get credit for it.  Every time she shows it off.  It's got to be perfect.  And Steven Singer understands that very well.  At Steven Singer Jewelers, they have the perfect system to make sure you get the perfect ring.

Yeah, they at least trip you on the way out or something, but it's, you know, it's-  There's something painful going on.  They just start chucking little diamond chips at you.  Well, I know that when I'm in a street fight-  It's very sharp.  And I turn my rings around when I slap a bitch.  Exactly.

Anything you could possibly want.  Jewelry.  You're not engaged?  No, I can't wear nice-  I can't wear jewelry.  I can't have nice things.  Why?  I lose it.  Is that why you're not engaged?  Yeah.  Because you just lose the ring, so why would I give it to you?  Exactly. 
[03:53:00]  Are you single or dating someone?  I'm dating someone.  How long have you been dating them for?  It's a long time.  It's like five weeks.  Oh, so you're not really pressuring them to-  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's so new.  Yeah.  Do you like relationships, or are you not really a relationship type?  It's been a while.  It's been like three years since my last-  Why so long?  I don't know.  Just because I moved here, and I just can't be bothered.  A lot of hooking up, though?  A little bit, but I don't know.  I just-  If I'm going to hook up with a boy, if I'm going to give him my time, he needs to be- 
[03:53:30]  Like, I can't be a waste of my time, because there's just pussies.  Is time Australian for a vagina?  It can be.  Yes, yes.  My time.  I'm going to give him my time.  Yeah.  But it's just like, I don't know.  A lot of men are pussies with stuff.  Really?  And I can't handle them, because if a guy cracks his shits, I'm like, yeah, see you  later.  I'm done.  Wait, cracks his shits?  Crack the shits.  Like, they get pissy at something.  This is what Bob Kelly was talking about with your annoying Australian slang that you do  on his podcast.  You know, like, a guy cracks his shits.  It's like, you know, like, I had a guy a little while ago where he was like, we had a small 
[03:54:00]  argument, and then he just got on his phone and started, like, you know, texting and  looking up at Twitter.  I'm like, what's wrong?  You okay?  He's like, I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'm like, get out.  You don't like oversensitive guys?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that happens a lot in New York?  Yeah, boys, the older they are, the more pissy they are.  Joe DeRosa was in here today.  Listen, I don't want to name names.  Sounded more same.  Yeah, he had it.  He was there, but then he started cracking shits up or whatever.  Cracking the shits?  Oh, poor Joey Roses.  Yeah, today he was just like, he's scared about the storm that's coming. 
[03:54:30]  He's crying during Love Actually, the movie.  Dude, that's the movie that makes me cry.  You're a girl.  I know, but that's the only way.  I don't cry over anything.  That's the one film that makes me cry at the airport at the end.  But Joey, oh, poor Joey.  You know what it is, though?  What?  Joe needs something to happen.  A dick?  Well, isn't he trying to bang?  Bailey J?  Well.  Or whoever?  Yeah, I think he was.  Wasn't he trying to bang an older woman?  He was trying to bang an older woman. 
[03:55:00]  Does it happen?  Do we know?  Not that I'm aware of, no.  I mean, he was in here as recently as Monday talking about how much he wanted to.  Yeah, well, I saw him on Monday as well because he was on our show.  And he was talking about that again?  Have a good weekend.  You too.  Bye, guys.  Opie, Tom Green.  I hope you both learned something from each other in that conversation.  Yes.  We were talking about our video.  YouTube stars.  It's Tom Green and Opie Radio.  Yes.  Separate YouTube accounts.  Absolutely.  You got something good? 
[03:55:30]  Is this inspired you, Opie?  Is there going to be something good?  He's got a camera.  Yeah?  Yeah, he just cost me about five grand.  What kind of camera are you getting?  I can't say.  Why?  I can't say because then everyone will have the same camera.  Yeah.  Well, not everybody has five grand to blow on a camera.  Yeah, they do.  I don't.  You do.  You can find it if you had the passion.  Well, what's the camera?  I can't say.  I got to know.  What if I want to get a nice camera too?  All right, he wants something no one else has.  Let me have it.  But I want a nice.  You do a camera and they use these tapes.  Yep.  You record on tapes. 
[03:56:00]  Fisher Price.  Oh, Fisher Price.  They're getting into the cassette tape.  They're getting into the state-of-the-art camera world.  I've seen it.  Is it one of those new cameras where you can put the little tape inside the big tape and  then play it in a VCR?  Oh, that's cool.  You're on to it.  That's cool.  Beta.  Beta Max?  Beta Max.  Wow.  Making a big comeback.  Do you ever have a Fisher Price video camera?  I've never had it.  I've never had it recorded onto an audio cassette.  Whoa.  What about the video part?  Yeah.  You record it onto an audio cassette. 
[03:56:30]  The video did.  That's incredible.  Yeah.  Amazing.  It's all.  It's all.  Why is she here?  It's all magnificent.  She's a guest on my show.  She's a guest and she gets Bob Kelly his coffee.  No, she's on the show with him.  Oh.  I mean, she does.  She does.  Why are you getting me chocolate chip cookies?  Because I'm a nice person.  I thought you were like some kind of like.  No.  I'm a comic.  She's his co-host on the show, but she also like.  When I did his show, she was like, oh, can I get you anything to drink?  And she's writing down things.  I'm like having the big conversation with Bob Kelly at Levity Live and she's around. 
[03:57:00]  I'm like, hey, give me some cookies.  You got Opie cookies when you weren't doing the podcast?  Yeah, because I'm a nice person.  I like looking after people.  Well, it's Opie.  I want to look after him.  He's a guest in our green room.  I'll do that for him.  I thought you worked for the club.  No.  He thinks you're Bob's personal assistant.  No.  I'm a comic.  She's a comedian.  He knows.  He's a son of a bitch.  I know.  I can tell.  You have no idea.  Thanks.  You know, there's a fine line between being helpful to people. 
[03:57:30]  Sam, did you promote anything of mine today?  Yeah.  You can check out Opie's videos at YouTube slash Not Sam.  I wouldn't take that.  I keep meaning to play.  Maybe I'll play the clip on Monday.  Remember what I said before about poking the bear?  Yeah.  Is that what that was?  Yeah.  I posted a video because I interviewed CM Punk last weekend from the WWE.  Boom.  And he smacked me in the back of my head at the end of the video.  And I was like, this is something I got to put.  And I got a clip from it, but I think I'm going to wait until Monday to play it.  Did it hurt?  Yeah, it did actually. 
[03:58:00]  Fucking hell.  Yeah.  He started the interview by stepping on my foot.  Is he a bully?  He's a little bit of a bully.  But it was almost like a...  I mean, he probably saw it as a, I'm going to bully this nerd.  And in my mind, I was like, oh, this is like a big brother and a little brother.  Just, you know, having fun.  Having a good time.  Pulling your hair.  Maybe it was more like a girly boy thing.  You think you had a crush on me?  That would be awesome.  Yeah.  That hair is something to die for.  You think so?  Mm-hmm.  Well, maybe that's what it was.  You didn't like my whole voice before?  It was so great.  It's terrible, but it's fantastic. 
[03:58:30]  It's really bad.  It's really bad.  Bad in a good way.  Justin Stangle from David Letterman.  He wants to know who you are and where you're from.  Who I am?  Yeah.  Is that like a trick question?  No.  He just said the girl that's on.  Who is the girl?  Where is she from?  I'm from, well, I live in New York now, but I'm from Melbourne in Australia.  And Justin.  Yeah.  We've said it.  Her name's Kelly Festuca.  Yeah.  Festuca.  It's Italian.  Boom.  She's on.  Anthony.  Intern Anthony.  She's on Bob Kelly's podcast. 
[03:59:00]  You know what, dude?  And she's been on this show before.  She almost ruined intern Anthony's relationship.  Yep.  I've ruined a few people's lives with my contact with One.  Bobo's.  Bobo's lives.  Yeah.  Intern Anthony.  I mean, he's next.  You know what?  You know what we almost ruined?  Uh-oh.  You know, one day I was thinking, because Tom Green had his mom on the phone, and as it  turns out the bitch, the where's my dinner bitch statue is the bit that got her so pissed  off, Sal, our guy here, has decided that he is like of the Tom Green school of thought 
[03:59:30]  where we're going to pull jokes on my mom.  I don't know if you heard about this, but a couple days ago, we had Sal's mom on the  phone, and I got her to tell me all of her sexual fantasies about Barry Manilow.  Oh, that's right.  She would have fucked him here in the bathroom.  Yeah.  You know, Eric, I'm not going to tell you how to do your job.  But, we got a lot of comments on that.  I kind of feel like Sal's mom on the after show should probably be on the countdown.  She was a Manilow fan?  Well, there's a different Sal bit in there.  What's in there?  Uh, when we made him reenact Angry Panda Live, and everybody was doing the sound effects, 
[04:00:00]  and...  I still think you tack the 10-minute Sal's mom phone call to the end of that.  Oh, man.  Yeah, we'll see.  Tack it to the end of the bit.  That way people get familiar with it.  You know what I mean?  What happened after the panda thing?  We talked to Sal's mom about her fucking dudes.  Jeez, Barry Manilow.  I would have taken her more as like a...  Because Sal's Italian, right?  Mm-hmm.  Is he Italian?  Is everyone here Italian?  I'm not.  Okay.  Right.  Well, you got to...  Okay.  Yeah.  We got to wrap up already. 
[04:00:30]  Oh, jeez.  You have to come back.  Maybe you come back next week and actually get a show in.  Okay.  But this Sunday, I'll be on from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern.  Wait till you hear my guest lineup.  What?  For the Sam Roberts show.  What?  Sunday, 4 p.m. Eastern here on the Opie and Anthony channel.  Linda Blair and Rick Springfield.  What?  That's right.  The exorcist herself.  That's right.  Boom.  I said...  Well, I don't know if she's the exorcist.  She was exercised.  Oh, yeah.  An exorcist is one who performs the exorcist.  I say in Talking Marks. 
[04:01:00]  I understand.  The movie.  I understand.  And yeah, maybe it's a little bit of a throwback.  And I'll probably play that CM Punk interview too.  But that's only like four minutes long, so that's not a big deal.  Four minutes.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Snow cane.  Huh?  Snow cane.  Snow cane.  What about it?  Monday.  Okay.  We talked about it all day on the show.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  The Iron Man of radio, Rob Bennington, is going to be back in here.  So stay tuned for that.  Thanks for stopping by for like ten minutes.  Oh, well, thanks for having me.  Sorry it wasn't longer. 
[04:01:30]  That's okay.  It will be next time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll see you on Monday.  Goodbye, everybody.  Boom.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.
